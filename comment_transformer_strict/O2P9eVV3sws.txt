Why is it everything as green on it I don't understand
What is the matter with these drivers 😢😢
How can you have only one pump? That's just excuses that nwc uses. Another one is they're drilling wells. It's a shame and the citizens sit back and say or do nothing. I bet if they get water before the election,  when it's over there'll be no water. The people are the problem for not rebelling, not the government.  You can't do nothing and expect changes.
WHY IS THE JLP PUSHING UP VENESHA PHILLIPS SO MUCH. IIS SHE THAT RELEVANT?
What I want to see in the manifesto of the major political parties is a commitment to completely disentangle the country from the last vestiges of colonialism and dismantle the Westminster system of government. It is high time Jamaica has a directly elected executive leader. However, I won't hold my breath.
