I did 3 reps and I’m cooked. What’s good for reps in this workout?
My favorite part of this video is the encouragement rfom the instructor and the fact that everyone is moving at their pace to complete the exercise. I Did ONE to try and it ain't a joke. It's solid af! I'm 303lbs but fairly strong, so I'm gonna start out with a single set of 5 to get into it and progress into more reps as I get stronger. Great to do when taking a break from gaming/working on my computer for hours.   Sidenote: What was the event that assembled all these sexy men in one place...asking for a friend?
Man, f all that! If you’re not training to be a pro athlete, what is the goal!?

What if you’re not advanced in pushups like that? What is the other simple method?
I would find this sexy if I wasn't more amazed that everyone saw this once and not only remember it but did it so fast and almost in unison.  The memory. I'm getting the body to move is the head part, of the shoulders knees and toes, right?

How would that change my life? It's pretty obvious you already have to be as fit - and fit in a specific way - as these dudes to do this routine in the first place. If you try doing this without prior conditioning you'll burn out mid-session. If you don't, you didn't need to do it in the first place. :3
Nice stock ya got there! How much money for three?

My only comment on this is why the fuck would I exhaust myself with a painstakingly long, not fun and probably far from optimal routine when I can just lift weights or do weighted calisthenics ?
Why do it this way? Seems like you are just going to fatigue yourself way faster than the muscles can get a good stimulus. Just use some plates to elevate your hands and milk the eccentric and a nice pause at the bottom to get a nice stretch.

What is one push up like this the whole thing or each time you do a push up?
When I was 16 I started lifting weights.  I was raised by neglectful morons, so I was always looking for attention.  I wanted to be “huge”.  I did ok, but squatting and lifting if hundreds of pounds ruined my ability to move.  Constantly pushing my body too far.    I regret thinking this type of workout was pointless.  I’d be 10000000% healthier today in my 50s.
