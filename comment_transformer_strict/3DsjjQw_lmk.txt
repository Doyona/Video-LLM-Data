Cole the one that steps in with real spitters... Let's name a few : Daylyt, Ab Soul, Benny the Butcher, Joyner Lucas! J.Cole back in the 90s could have easily hang with the likes of Rakim, Gza. Nas, Krs One. Who agrees with me?
Why this not on iTunes anymore
Why is this not on apple music anymore smfh ? Goated rap.
Why is this song unable for download on apple in ‘25? I’m tryna listen today and Apple is like nah shawty my fault
Put it back on streaming sites please !?!?
Why tf they take this off Apple Music ?🤦🏾‍♂️🔥
Why tf this isnt in spotify
I wonder if someone has talked about this in the comment section.   The "lean" in "doing insane amount of lean" could also be a reference to purple drank, a recreational drug. That said, this only adds another layer of meaning to the "this ain't prescribed cause there's no doc for pain they harboring". While the first "lean" refers to physical pain, the second "lean" refers to substance abuse. The antidote?   A Plate of Collard Greens.    Whatya think? :)
Nobody else recognized the Rocky/Creed sample in there?
How many verses of the year this year is cole gonna write ? 😮‍💨
Why Isn’t this on streaming? Can’t waste bars like this!
I have been a Cole fan since '09, but these bars of him being dangerous need to stop after he backed out against Kendrick. I understand that he wanted to stay out of it, but that 7 Minute Drill was terrible and it was the first time we actually saw Cole respond to someone directly. It was mediocre at best. I am sure you have die-hard fans who will say I am wrong, but as someone who loves Cole, I can't believe him after what we all heard. Like I said, it wasn't the fact that he backed out because that is understandable, it was more so the diss track itself. All that tough talk and you delivered that (7MD)??
When is this going to be on Spotify!!!!
Why isn’t it on Spotify 😭

How vain is his fucking belief????? The fucking goat! 🐐
What if dot bring out Cole on stage in February 😮🔥🔥🔥
Why is Cole always so fucking boring with his delivery, I can't listen to this shit, they are both boring as hell. He's a great writer but a bad rapper because he's so fucking slow and boring with very weird choices when to pause.
what the date is on the top right of the check?
What Daylyt did here was criminal. No words were wasted.
When this gonna be on streaming services
Where is this on spotify bro
Why is this not on Spotify 😤😤😤😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
what was this beat originally from? I cant think but I just remember it was 🔥
Are nigga really sure Cole is scared of Kendrick? Cause we all know that Kendrick didn’t rap like this on not one diss song… ijs…
Why do people get on a song with Cole and feel like they gotta rap all extra lyrical
Wtf is the sample saying ? Anybody?
can you like something more then once on here damn!!!!!!!!
When the talent is truly yours, the controversies eventually fade. I knew Cole would be just fine. Still and has always been well ahead of Drake to me.
Placed inside the trap, tapped with laxatives and we think that we runnin' shit?
Who needs another way to cause a scream?
24 September 2024 Collard greens  dropped  Still alive breathing applying pressure. Who alive.?
How can yall hold this man accountable for being a Grown Man. What Cole did was grown man shit. Great Song Daylyt .
Ight but we need some drums on this yeah?
How Cole wash lyt like that 😭
Is this freeway beat? Shit sound so familiar
When Daylyt said "Go" he made it a double entendre by telling the GOAT to Go.
Does anyone else get angry when u Kno coles verse is almost over???
When it’s my turn a kick (tourniquet) I apply pressure like I’m trained to stop a leak 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
