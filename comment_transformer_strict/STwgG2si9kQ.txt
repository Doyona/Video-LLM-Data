This episode was so fun 😭 When they said Lee Know had to guess the members' eyebrows, I thought they were going to show him pictures of their eyebrows, but no, they literally plucked a strand of their eyebrows and gave it to him 😭How did Lee Know guess 4/8 of them correctly??

DIV1 HAIRSTYLISTS. Can you guys stop neglecting Chan's curls and bother to style them properly instead of either straightening it or just hide it with a beanie?
Does anyone know why chan is covering his hair??
Who will support skz forever ♾️✋ 손 들어  ❤
Lee know calling Yongbok "Felix" is a bit... strange?
Can I give you a point?🙏🙏🙏Or secured
But that was the funniest one yet leeknow was on point. That was crazy. Even though it wasn't eyebrows 😅 did han even play or Felix??
3:19 I didn't even know he could do it, how was i supposed to know how much time?
How little is needed for happiness so  that only baby Seungmini does not hide  his unrealistically beautiful face and the  most beautiful smile in the world😭🤲😍❤
How much I love this vibe, which only he has, how much I love Seungmin's character traits: when he knows that he is good, but he will  never shout about it on every corner. When  he is completely confident in his actions and  just goes to the goal without changing himself, remaining as he is.
What happened to the end? Where was changbins results 😮
Why doesn't anyone talk about han? How cute he looks, his hair, glasses and his laugh are attractive 😭💗💗
How are you guys so fast?? 😭😭
