But wait who was it that used that thing to get everyone to the pool. Remember the "surprise waiting for everyone at the pool" or whatever it said that also sounded like Rayne?
When I read you lied to us all, that reminds me of the scene when Liberty was saying, Summer had us all fooled😊May Summer Ranger return back onto our screens and marry Sienna please❤️Team Summer and Sienna💕Team Simmer💍
How exactly did she drown when she went into the pool? Did she hit her head before she went in? Obviously she can swim so it couldn't have been her not knowing how to swim.
Would make sense if it was Hunter because, why would he go out of his way to expose Peri and Romeo? 🤔 missed opportunity there, Hollyoaks.
That surely can't be the end of it? That was the worst reveal I've ever seen. What an anti climax!!! Also, if Rayne got up after hitting her head, and was fine and able to attack Romeo, then why wasn't she able to get out of the pool too?
Why they dressing lizzy to look like a potato 🥔. This reveal has taken way to long 😕, they dragged it on so long we all got to the point where we didn't care anymore 🤷‍♀️
How is Prince trying to take a morale high ground here when his been trying throw Perri under the bus from the get go
Ahhh who beat him up and chucked him in the van?
Are you kidding me with this? Romeo knew Prince was innocent from the start and let him go to jail for his crime? Everbody has been tearing at each other like animals and he was to blame the entire time. Hunter needs to knock Romeo's lights out for this.
Romeo tell me that's true?
Cant be the only one getting riverdale series 1 vibes from this  Also i still dont understand how pheonix became part of all this in the first place?
Were we really surprised though? I mean someone getting abused it all had to come to this at some point Romeo had more of an intimate motive then anyone else anyone else was just a decoy
Ugh worst hollyoaks reveal ever! But have I missed something I thought he was sleeping with peri at the time??
I haven’t watched this show in a couple of weeks, but wasn’t the killer already revealed ?
