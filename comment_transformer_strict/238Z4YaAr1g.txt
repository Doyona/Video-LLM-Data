Why be half naked. Is it really necessary 🤔
Are we expected to sit and watch this till the end? 😂  She's got old and lazy now?
Why are black people taking our music?
What is next?Maybe Jay Z craping with a Country beat and then they will give him album of the year or call him the next great thing in country music
No hate beautiful song but whats up with the video?
Image buying grammys cuz you can't win em and you have to steal one from someone. What music even is this?
Is there any kind of song Beyonce can't do? I'm hoping to hear pop from before 1900, and opera. It will be great. I am saying this from the rural West,, with experience in road houses and dive bars
What a joke!😂 Mumble like the fat Albert gangs' Mushmouth. How about putting music to the words " don't touch me! I can't breathe, I didn't do nufin'😂." Bmamba. Mbutu 😂. Do a land apology. To the cowboys.
Couldn't she sing without showing her boobs ??
Hey Shaun, I know you’re checking these comments every 30 minutes :) Does unemployment come with unlimited comment replies?
Is this really the video? 10sec looped? Get the fuck outta here
How TF did this shit song beat the masterpiece that Chris Stapleton played with Cold
She stold this from the Mexican singer. Guess who she is??

Is there an award for worst music video of all time?
Isn’t this someone else’s music ????
Why is she comming out like that?  She doesn't  have to shes beautiful  n can sing!
A black woman want to be white, see?
Is this supposed to be country music?
Why does she have to be naked? Is she a strip teaser or a musician? Shame on the human race. Shame on the men who tell the women to publicly undress and Shame on the women who do it. And this one definitely doesn't need the money. What is she at? No dignity, integrity, or sovereignty.
Why has she got to have tits out all time. Absolutely discusting.
It's bad enough that she's half naked and wearing a hideous get-up, but it's not even her torso! Her breasts are either air-brushed or AI generated. Maybe some folks need artificial help to improve their unappealing body.. but.. Beyoncé? Really..?  Also, what is the point of this banal video? I don't think I've ever seen a more unimaginative music video. What "genius" came up with this?
Why does she keep doing the same movements 😂 1:56
Is this 2025's version of creative genius?
How do they keep her nipples from popping out? I watched that clip 34 times and I still don't know. Are they glued to taped to the jacket?
I hate her voice but this is a bop. What's wrong with me!?
She's one of gay z's help and you call them your family , even if I'm telling you I don't want you , why would you still f with them ?
This is supposed to be country?
What is the video mean??? Just her walking from the dark with hardly any clothes on?? And pretending to shoot with her fingers??? That’s the whole video??? I only watched halfway and was sick of it!!
This song is so horrible. How is this music?
How about you guy actually try a real country music star Mickey Guyton - Better Than You Left Me. Because Beyoncé  WILL NEVER BE COUNTRY SINGER SHE A POP STAR
What kind of weed would Beyonce be smoking that would make her think she is a country singer
Hahahahaha she done lost her damn mind...who told her this was a good idea?
How dare she Ho-ify country music with such a boring video!🤣 so much talent so little creativity. She was lazy with this……
Diddys trial is almost over, where all those "she knows" people?
What a sellout. Just for...well you know who runs the industry.......money money money
beyonce singing country?!?!   wouldn't these super lefty's call this cultural appropriation???????!!!???
Is her right breast larger than her left?
How speciallll are you hunny wacko doodle doo loves you  Paulie Z 🖊️🖊️🦉🛋️🛋️🛋️🛋️🛋️
Well;, it's not Coal Miners Daughter, Blue, Stand By Your Man, Crazy, or Jolene, but it is definitely a country song by a female singer. However, it won't win any awards. Well, maybe a Grammy, but what do they know about country music?
where the hell is jay-z at while beyoncé out here touching her self half naked 😂😂😂
Why aren’t the other artist listed as feature artists?… her and Drake move the same way. I would have said no. I want my name on the song. People need to stop worshipping this woman and start thinking with their pockets like she does.
What the hell is even that!?!?
What a fucking joke. The burger King bs was really stupid. Sounds the same.
When I whistleblow it makes them look really bad so they’re so desperate that oh I’m putting you in rehab and claiming mental health. A crime in itself when it comes to those who are in actual need such as Ed himself
Full house boyZzzzz. . . Nah but foreal AI? Coincidence? Planned or the motion?

Am I the only one who actually likes this song? 😂 I know it’s not really country, just a bit of a country vibe to it. Or do y’all just hate her?
Lady you got 3? shows what we black can do?
What in the world has happened to Country music? I don't think we will ever see Beyonce at the Grand Ole Opry!!
How the fuck did this win country album of the year? It’s not country at all it’s pop with a guitar 😂 very disappointed in the music industry
Why is this a Grammy winner for one it needs to rewrote “This ain’t country”
Why do singers in America show so much of they body ,,lm my day they would be called something else ,all most a soft porn show

What if we helped both the border problem and the drug problem with kindness.  Send the immigrants back across the border with the drugs they supposedly bring.  If mexico doesnt take the drug, thus helping the economy, tyen at least the immigrant returning hime with nothing can join the cartel.

How to win grammy without any  effort😅😅
Why people gotta curse in music. ? Im not opposed to cursing but in a proper country music song it ain’t necessary. Next Niki M  is gonna being doing porn country. This is the down fall of country music.
Who is watching and hearing this song for the first time ever.   😂😂
How is this Country? How did this song win a grammy?? Honestly 😂😂😂 no wonder she was "shocked" to win 😂

Guess you can can elevate yourself to be too good for a few minutes of choreography??
Wow ..... She really got Grammy for this song???..... Over Billie's and Bruno's and many more great songs??
Who does she think she is? Sad how country music has gone down hill. This ain't country. Country women don't dress slutty.
How does anybody view this as country music
What? These haters saying this is terrible?
Came here to listen to this song for the first time along with a couple of on the album. What is this crap? Budget didn’t even allow for clothes. What’s with these celebs wresting no clothes?? Cowgirls wear clothes mate. Unless you’re a cow boy???
I love country music and this song sucks!  Maybe Beyoncé won the Grammy in place of being paid to sing at Harris campaign?  Why else would she win???
How in the hell did this crappie song win a Grammy??
Why not just strip and sing? You're almost there, girl.
How tf does this win over Billie’s album
Why was this song nominated as the best country song of the year
How does it feel Beyonce to have to buy your way to a grammy? This song is shit and your outfit is ridiculous.
Why are there suddenly so many n*zi's in the comments?  Yes this is country music, Beyoncé is texan unlike most of the frauds in the country music industry and black people SIGNIFICANTLY helped to create and craft the genre but were erased in history.
How in the hell is this country music
Is there humans in this comment section?  Sounds strangely digital.   The video itself is surely lacking 😢
what kind of shit music is this
Why is she naked?  Country isn’t naked! It’s about the music not the titiies!
why does it have to be overly sexual? everything is ass and titties....this is barely country and this song is the most country song in her album lmao
I don't see a ton of likes for any of the songs on the album, seems like a grammy win would have millions of likes.  What am i missing?

Is this some sort of a count sheep to sleep thing? Feels like it could do the same job to me.
The song and video repeats over and over again and again… typical with today’s music???
Why  does she always have to parade around half naked and doing the same stupid thing? Ghetto meets country, Yuck!
Is anyone else here to celebrate her winning a Grammy for Best Country Album?
Not even "country" wtf is this shiii?
meh ? Well as it is musical, but it's not country, and she ain't no Martina McBride. And the video I watched... OK?
Why is she half naked....and what is the point here...???  She just won album of the year for this one the Grammys.....I can't see why...for this...the other artists had allot more hits on their albums.....smh....
When she won “Best Country Album” … I stopped watching the Grammy’s… What A Joke!!
why does she have to use some of the unsavory language and sexy nothing for clothes? I will never understand someone with a great voice just pushes profanity, sex and money in her videos. Sad, just sad.
Is this a joke song making fun of country music or something? This might be the worst song ever recorded
Who's here after the tour announcement??
What is this hidden socciety stuff 👁👌  This isnt a coincidence
She wanted a grammy for this shit?
When did singers decide appearing almost naked added to their talents..is this her hubby's influence... just makes her look cheap and the video is crap...
When your old man pays for everything, of course, you're top! And part of Diddys group, they will all tumble soon. Long way to fall.
Why anyone would forget 2024 😂🎉❤ nevertheless let it go
Erm why is her yk showing?
This can't be the same Beyonce that sang "Irreppaceable"...this has to be a prank right?
Who else hears ‘hip replacement’ at 00:46? 🙈😅
Listen to lyrics carefully. Tornado in the basement. Whose basement? Diddy's?
Anyone here after her Nfl halftime Christmas performance?
That outfit was really necessary? Can't she afford clothes, i.e. some trousers, a shirt or something?

Is this a land of freedom?
What a controlled music industry obscenity that thing is... must do as she's told though.
You're joking right? Now the country girls have to slut out too... and this is a good song?
Anybody into real old school country hates this for a list of reasons. Can you find them all?
What a disgrace to country music.  Seriously an award?  I guess everyone gets an award even if you suck as a country singer.
Why are people upset with her this was pretty good lol
What a joke this trash is !!

When Jesus's say yes no body say no...LOL love you JZay.low profile
One would think that one so famous wasn`t forced to appear half-naked for a country song. Why? Isn`t the song dope enough?
What a lazy gormess crap, where she can't be bothered to sing...
When will she go to jail?
Might aswell not even wear that jacket?
Does anyone else feel like she or whoever is trying to make fun of country music?
Is this one of the Freak Off outfits? 😍
Why are they always 17 comments on every video I’m watching 😂
Who else is listening to this as part of a " personal farewell tour" 😢?
why is she dressed like its  a CORN video  ??
How are you beyonce after Adele sharing half of her Grammy and my favorite singer is still left eye which is Lisa Lopes. Why do you want popularity when you already have 32 Grammy or whatever, like chill and let other people shine too. You just need p diddy for this? Wow!
Why haven't YouTube deleted this demonic low intelligent psychopaths music yet?
I dont get how country music folks didnt welcome Beyonce yet Dolly Parton stepped into Rock and Roll and was so welcomed she was inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame. Wtf?
What such a tacky setup for a great song??
Who is a Beyoncé fan ☺️ 1:07
Life's good when u have enough money to hush anything up, eh 🐝?
Is this the official video? Huh???
Why didn’t she kill rihanna as she has more beautiful voice
What a shitty video.  Did she think dressing like a whore was going to be well received by country fans?   The country fans aren't going to let her taint country music like those skanks did to hip hop.  We use to have Missy Elliot now it's crap like Ice Spice and Doja Cat
How can she doo that to other celebs like that
this is ridiculous, how people can like this garbage?
Why does she have to make country music nakes as well......
What some shit music. Not country at all. Very happy she got zero awarda
Why do some people they can do ANYTHING?? Stay in your line. This ain’t working. I can hear “Say My Name Say My Name..” the whole song. This is not country.
Why don't you wear more clothes and why are you trying to muscle in on the VW scene? Are you mocking it? This song sucks btw.
Not a Beyonce fan and wondering why she gotta have her breasts exposed and looks like she is wearing pantyhose.  Huh?????
Why do everyone say this is country IT ISNT COUNTRY YALL
Why are all the comments hate like???
What an extreme amount of effort must have been put into this video..
who is there after the puff daddy affair ?
Why do they have her doing the same thing over and over?  Says the man who works 9 to 5 but got time to judge someone ultimately smarter than them.
I wonder why shes been called the queen? Like wheres the queen vibes
I want comment is it safe for my life ?
when she was talking about a hoe down... clearly she must of tripped!
What an example she sets for her daughters and other young girls ?
Is this the Beyonce that Sang, "when Jesus say Yes"? 🤷‍♀️ just sayin
Why she is half nude and not in a Cowboy dress? 🤔
What is this? The diva starts singing along to the chop? Scouts sing better songs by the fire with a guitar! It's a very very weak performance..
What the hell is this?? This is nasty bad!
Why these female singers need to show their bodies all the time ? Cant they be famous with clothes ?
Horrible on All levels.  And why is she half naked?
Why does she have no shirt and by the way my Teacher put it by accident and all the boys had to cover their eyes 👀 😅
Why oh why do female singers think they need to sex it up to be successful. If you're a good singer, you are -- without the pole stripper outfit. Respect yourself.
What about the Kids seeing an old granny like this???
What is happening. She’s pigging up the genre. No. Beyoncé no. She’s trash.
Were we going for the stupidest video of all time there Bey? If so .... Nailed it.
No wonder she wasn't nominated with this crap and her 'appearance'  Jeeze.  Where's  Dolly, Loretta,. Barbara, Patsy,  EmmyLou, Carrie,  Patty, Crystal, Lynn, Reba  and so on and so on.??
Maybe she could put some damn clothes on first??
Remember when Beyonce sang 'Nasty ' put some clothes on in the 90s.  What happened?
Are yall serious?? This isn’t a fkn country song, this is outright STUPID. Stay in your lane.
And to believe the recent hatred of Cowboy Carter is coming from people thinking she is trying to culture vulture the country genre 🤦🏿‍♂️ This woman is from Texas for God sake! She had country elements on multiple projects in the past but she now is at the level of not being forced into a certain genre. She's done pop, jazz, hip-hop, trap, Broadway, but no one is complaining but the country genre. Her latest album reached a new audience for country, why complain?
What an insult to country music
Why would anyone like this song, video or much less the want-a-be country musician?
Wait how did they get out?!? I need to know wtf?!?
What boring stuff really? Bryonce messing country with that outfit up . Now i get why the criticsm. Sorry this sucks 😂
Song of the year. Yes or no?
What a stupid and lazy thing.
What in the ever love of Santa Clause is this shit?   My ears are bleeding.
Is My New Freestyle to Beyoncé’s song Beautiful Liar Good??
Was this the greatest video of all time Kanye spoke of??
why does it sound so boring
why do thery drees like that
I appreciate when artists go back to their roots. Why have a this and a music video?
A pop song with some lyrics about Texas and banjo in the background. Is that what makes it a country music song?
Nothing more fake then a wannabe hillbilly songs terrible too wtf ???
When Beyonce wants to party you gots to cut her a paycheck...Matt Williams
I feel i watch a porn 😅 lol good song but where the texas and the dance 😅??
What is the point in this music video worst music video in the world
What is a Texan hold on? Ok I got it. Rondesantis. Wake me up. Florida.. Uh Oh Texas. Explain 😮😮😮
Why is she showing off her breast!!! This was really unnecessary she ruined the song
What a great example to young ladies she is!
When trying to fit a country audience. My advice is not to come out looking like a cat house madame.  you don't seem to respect yourself very much. You are one of the most talented singers ever, you don't have to share your sex habits every time you sing a song now.
Where is the live version? 😮 No qualitativ live version from the renaissance World tour. 😢
What TF is even this? Bro.
What the fuck did I just watch and listen too 😢😢😮
Why does she have to be basically naked to do this video? Isn’t she too old for that like I can hear a song without looking at naked women right?
Are female singers forbidden to wear clothes in Western societies or what?!
how does the jacket still cover your b**bs when your walking pretty fast
I wonder how many times her vest showed her chest 2:12
How the fuck is this country
can anyone here tell me what this song is supposed to be about?
What you get when you cross sorta-country with sorta-porn?
What a bunch of total crap  Should be ashame to listen to this piece shit
I love Beyoncé and the song’s  cool and fun.   But what’s up with overly simplistic looped  Video ?   Hmmm, can’t say she’s a starving new artist. I wonder why she chose to represent that way.   Possibly starting a trend? ‘unplugged’ minimalist version of a video?
You should’ve stuck with your oldies! The classics were so much better! Why country?
True question: what’s the point of a visualizer?
When she blows his fingers at the devil's face comes right away.
When Taylor Swift goes left, you go right.
Why do woman think they MUST show their breasts? They leave nothing to the imagination!
When you open and touch your boobs does it make a better show if you are good and trust your music you dont need this show of sexism
Why do you to be half naked I don't know any country singer who dresses like this😮
They couldn’t find clothes for her for this video?
What liqueur my love???????????? As if TO fly !!!!!!!!
Why did you strew me.on fourth you got pregnant and later had miscarriage?
What the hell is even that, lawd  Nooooooooooooooooooooo
How many kids are there to see you live that
why is their no (real) music video for this. same with her previous hit with "break my soul" just a visual
Such a TERRIBLE song! My goodness! It is horrible beyond belief. What has happened to our art?
how is this song called Texas Hold em when its very first lines are ”This ain't Texas, ain't no hold 'em”, this bugs me to no end
Wait… This is the actual video?
Is it ok to hate this? Tipsy 1000% better.
Where is full Video of this song @beyonce
Out of all the people on YouTube that made dance videos to this song waiting for her video to come out this is it? Walking naked and shooting an imaginary gun over and over? I know it's not from lack of knowing how to dance she's a professional dancer I don't get it?
Who else is here in June 2024
Who’s here because of Lexus?
What you ordered online vs what is delivered...
Worst video ever! For a crappy piece of music. I didn’t care for Beyoncé before her country stage. Think she just torpedoed her career. And why would any videographer think the same clip over and over was a good idea? Couldn’t think of anything else? Hungover or something?
I like the tune, but what in the 2024 Texas ILLUMINATI is this video? Also, why does my tablet autocorrect ILLUMINATI to capital letters?
Why do all these so called female pop stars frel they have to show the riskay parts of there flesh off.  All generic and dumb ...wake up citizens dont pay to see future rotted flesh.
does anyone else hear shaun the sheep theme in the whistling part of the song 😁🤪prob just me
How does this video relates to country genre? 🤦🏾‍♂️
What a disgrace to country music. Pathetic
So this’s all the video?
Who ever likes this song are brainwashed 💩💩💩💩
Who the fuck gave her permission to do country?
The fact that I love her so much I literally asked if I could go swim just to play this on the speaker!      My time  3:24 what about yours?
Why is it necessary to show her breasts
one of the most horrible kitch songs ever. and what about those super bad effects and noises?
Why the Fuck she dressed like that? Country isn’t about selling your body and the lyrics are terrible
Who created this crap. This woman is a very talented puppet. HOW could she agree to this boring waste of time?
How did this song make it to number one?😊
What a boring video 😐 I expected more
Why do Texans hate her so much?
Sure aren't we all country now?
Stupid video.  Of all of the creative artists in the world this is the best they can come up with??
Why celebrities people getting naked always are they singing or doing porn film
Is This song available to set as caller ringtone??
How did this get famous she is just doing the same thing
When you mix rap with country you get crap
When you only have that one thing you can think of
Yow! Now I want a Metal album. Is she Borg?
tho its the short where is the short?
Why this music video on repeat?
Did an AI write these lyrics? They play this song all the time at my workpalce and everyone hates it. Many of them are fans of her too
How in the world did she know a Tornado was gonna hit Houston? This song came out weeks before 🤔
Is Beyonce dressed as a sexy Borg?
Who made this Yippity Doo Haw ass song 😂
How come she’s not wearing a cowgirl outfit?🤷‍♀️…she’s almost naked singing like a caw girl…not matching!..no,no!,..love the song 🎶 though 👍 ?
Why "don't be a bitch" and "that shit ain't pretty"? Way to go, you found a way to ghetto up a country song. SMH!
This is defo country 2024 . if she tours this Album love to see who her warm up acts are !! Willie ?
When Blue is going to do a nose job and turn blonde?
That's the whole video just repeating of her walking in trust exercise with that vest?
People actually listen to this crap?
What in the actual F***!!!!! Stay in your lane
So they just did one clip and put it in a loop and that’s the music video nowadays?
What a video!! I'd be embarrassed if this all you got!!
Where are the jeans and cowboy hat? She's a disgrace to country music. Stick to the genre you are good at.
Do people not know what a visualizer is?
why is beyonce so white? when she first became famous she was much darker. in my opinion, making her more white is insulting to black americans.
where did them curls come from
What a shit song. No wonder it's hated. Abysmal 😂
Why does Beyonce videos and pictures look like porn recently....
I’m confused where is the rest of the video?
What the hell did I just watch. Wtf kinda none existing outfit was that? That was horrible.
Song not to bad, but video sucks. Country is not about half naked women with a patch on her eye. Does she even know how to dress proper or dance  country?
What the hell did I just listen to?
Why are you doing country?  You’re not country at all at all at all.  Did you sell yourself to the Illuminati or something?  Makes no sense.  Don’t care about the boob flash at all.  Please stop.
How can her agent let her think this is good. 🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈
Stupid song and absolutely boring video. What exactly is the point of this video? Is it just to show off her body?
what did she smoke b4 the video? weird as!!
What a disgusting creature that is.
I call this video cringe. Anyone feel same?
Did Beyoncé run out of money?
What is a visualizer? New term?
What a shame  :  hope the REAL country singers  boycotting this bs . She can go through all the genre . that don’t make her the queen of anything .
So is she a porn star these days? Or why the whorish clothing?
Why show yourself like that this is boring real boring
what the hell did i just listen to need to go jam a screwdriver in my ear
Why is she naked she is a mom
What happened to her voice? I thought it was a dude?
Was it necessary to be half naked ???
What the ever loving hell are you doing with fingers? Want a real gun? I can lend you you .22
Is this legit the actual music video and not just a sample?
Why was I not told about this song and had to come across it by accident when someone used a portion of it for their Insta reel???!!!!!!! Dam you, YT!!! 🤍🤍🧡🧡🤍🤍🧡🧡🤍🤍💛💛🤍🤍🧡🧡🤍🤍🧡🧡🤍🤍
is that a street hooker costume?
What the fuck ???!!! Great song but bad vidéo !!!!
What a delusion! I think Beyonce thinks only about herself doing this video and not thinking to entertain people. Or maybe for the people to talk about this video.🤦‍♀️ I’m sure a lot of us forwarded the video directly to the end hoping that there are some changes at least at the end.😆
Why is she so down on Lexus's?
It is necessary topless? The outfit is terrible…is she a stripper in the video?
Move back to your thing, not good, even with the titis and all that, nope, sorry. It’s a disrespect to country music, horrible, what is next? Showing ass?
Why is she naked can't watch it 😢😢
To all the people saying "its a visualiser" what the hell is a visualiser?? Is that the thing we're calling the little looped videos they use for Spotify or something? Can we call it something else given that "visualiser" is a generic word?
They ran out of ideas or what?
Anyone else wish that Beyonce would just stay in her lane?
How can people hate on her doing country with THAT VOICE! Dang she's pleasant to listen to. Do your thang, B! 🔥
Mediocre song, even more mediocre video. Who thought this was a great idea?
Why is she dressed so sleazy?  This song absolutely sucks.
Why is there so many haters maybe that's Y..  Beyonce did it always will love this beautiful amazing woman. . End of discussion everybody's got an opinion and that's mine
Beyonce: I look hot as s$$t in that take. Just use that on a loop.  Producer: Are you shure? Beyonce: with one hand on her hip, did you actually watch that clip?
Why she didn't have dance to go with the song on video
I keep hearing she’s no country singer, but it’s not too Bad, maybe if the video had some plot to it, it would probably add some Diversity?
Texas porn here! Why is she always half naked in her song ????
Did Diddy say they all worship the evil guy downstairs? 😮 they all crazy but I do like this song despite their personal choices in faith / worship.
What the hell is this she is doing nothing but walking and blowing her fingers in  pantyhose and a leather vest 🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷🤷
Why does she even wear clothes?  Sorry girl, you aren't country
when i heard this song in like every second tiktok i assumed it was some old classic resurfacing, it just sounds so familiar
Why she gotta be cursing like that
How the fuck is this country jay z cheat on her again
What a lazy piece of crap this video is, and the song is not much better.
When did Beyonce become so bad
Is there an encrypted message in this gig?
When you’re to old for this shit and have no moves left…
Awww. Does anyone else remember when Beyonce was good ?
Why when they become curtain age they start undressing more ?
https://youtu.be/-sbBD96_31M?si=JzSEJizv00VI59iL   Beyonce is not country and neither are most of her delusional followers. Most of her music sucks. What does she sound like without autotune?
Was she assimilated by the Borg? She seems to have a Seven of Nine thing going on.
Where is that Texas dance we came in to see from Bronco Texas Beyonce? This visualization lacks substance.
Why does  she  have  her  boobs out
Why is she not singing,  and why does she have to be halfway naked
yall realize it said visualizer and not music video?
Is that country ? Us are lost😢
What the fuck I don’t love this fucking song and trend and sound 💩
Are you still walking naked granny.? Get dressed and embrace Islam before it's too late
Is the whole video her doing that??
Why is she dressed like that, they say her album is breaking records, what's this world coming to
I love this song. Some of the country music these days is terrible and stupid. This song is definitely country. Beyoncé has always been a country girl. She still has her southern accent. Whoever is casting her out A) hasn’t listened to the whole song. The banjo was awesome. She actually sang about southern things not some stupid country pop song like these dudes. Miranda lambert vibes. I’m white and I love her and I am happy she did this bc this needed to happen to bring the haters out. When a black man came out in country they didn’t care. A black woman does its an issue?
Wait.  This is real?  Not a joke?
what is the flow? and how can one be taken to it?
Am I the only one who don't understand this video at all??
what is this catching song, weird revealing outfit and the dance is on loop
How the fuck this shit has so many views. There ain’t no talent at all in that song. Shitty lyrics, shitty beat, shitty flow, just pure garbage.
is it just me or is this song kanda racist?
I wish YouTube hadn't removed the "dislike" number. This video has to take the cake. Is this what Los Angeles thinks country is?
Why even bother with clothes the f*ck is this
Why r her t's out tho 💀☠️💀
Why is it the same thing over and over again?
What the hell was she thinking!?
Why she feels the need to show her boobs when having such a fabulous voice is beyond me.But maybe i'm oldfashioned.
So, no hold hold down on your dress either?  Is this a  country song ?
Why do american women have to be half naked in making a song video?
Who knew Franklin (the cartoon) was country!
What a great song by a great artist!!!
Where has real county outfits gone 😢
What a disappointment of a video 😢
i just got told this clip has a song attached ?
Why she got her tities out
What the actual fuck is this?
Why is it necessary to have your boobs hanging out and swear? That doesn't make it country. That doesn't add anything to a potentially good song.
Why, as they get older, do they have to go Full SLAPPER in the videos?
Why bother to come out with your napkins!  No surprise to your game you always show everything the good Lord gave you
I wonder how the disliked this video is?
How is this country it's more hip hop and country 👎🏻
What the heck is she wearing???
why why this is what mk ultra does fro that decision making
That’s the worst song ever . That’s not even country wtf is this ?
What’s the point of this ‘visualizer’?
Lol, what weed Beyonce smokin? Some weed that converted her from R an B to country artist ?
I love this song but why can’t the video be classy? Why resort to that outfit?
Is it necessary to show your breasts? What a shame about the song so great.
Who got screwed over for her benefit?
Why does she need to be half naked to present the song? I love the song and Beyoncé‘s boobs on their way out are just disturbing 😂
why is there so many dislikes what is going on? this song is so good
Is this really her clip ? I was expecting something more different for this time, something rustic and natural. They really could have make an effort.
Why are you people allowing this devil to Infiltrate Country music, she is with Diddy, boycott her music.
how cheap can a billion air make a film clip for?
Why such great artists woman Has to look like sexual objects? 😑
Who else came here after listening to "Franklin the turtles" Theme song?
What a trashy video - our country women have at lest some respect for themselves. So please keep your destructive negativity out of country.
When wil the actual music video drop????? Isn't she making music videos anymore?
Omg Beyonce is a fembot!!!😮 horrible video. Shame Shane Shame.  Sad. Where is the protection?
Why is this on here. It's disgusting 😂🎉
I was told about this video and I said no way...................... But I be dang here it is. I have never laugh so hard in my life . Go back to pop or what ever you where singing in. Did she really say that white people was taking over rap so she was taking over country music ?
Good song, awful video. Why does she have to be half naked?
Ew wtf… this is disrespectful to country music. Plus this is just an awful loop of her half naked?!? Do people even get creative anymore?
Can someone stop her now please? Please!?
Is the record skipping  ? I know the video is
What the heck is this?!! I see the world we live in embodied in this video. Dark, desperate and on a vulgar downward looping spiral. Apparently, her voice isn't enough.
Why has she never done country!!!!! She is AMAZING!!! ❤
Why do they have her doin the same thing over and over? Easily answered question, she is a tool and this fuckin song SUCKS!!
How sad, country is not slutty
Where the horse at lady Where is your guns you need to go back to the other music
Why is the world like this see the next video she is gonna be naked
Who tf listens to this crap?
Why does it kind of show her boobs🤮🤮🤮🤮
So now its okay for others then black to dress or have their hair so called black?
Beyonce is an awesome singer, no doubt. But I find it hard to respect her when she always has her boobs hanging out. What do her children think of that?
I wonder if Diddy helped out?  According to word in the streets, He "helped" her allot.  Always had her "back" too.
What does being half nekkked have to do with country?
What kind of husband let his "wife "go to the street no wearing clothes?? Money Makes peolpe EVIL.
Franklin the turtle is that you?
Why do they have her doing the same thing over and over ?
Any Taylor Swift country music inspiration ?
Who heard Beyonce on the  radio
When your music has gone to complete shit and ur no longer prominent….  “I’ll just make a country bumpkin sounding track and have my tits out, that should get me views” lol
Why is she naked for a country song tho
Why is it needed to be dressed like that? Sooo low so awful?
What a disgrace to actual country music!!
Why so many people hate this? I'm not American I don't know what country is
This visualizer sucks. Is this AI?
Who was the idiot who composed the lyrics and music for this song? This isn't country music, it's bullshit.
What a stupid ass outfits with a stupid song.  That is not country at all girlfriend!!
What a devil Bad Video for such a cool song
Who would you vote for, as next President to the US, Beyoncé or Taylor? Considering the competion.
why does the video have to be so raw.  Kids like the song and I wouldn't want them to see this.  If you want to be country keep it clean.  You have the talent
this much money,still looping the video,VFX when?
What is up with her wearing a satanic eye gear,this is horrid. Your 50 with kids dress like it. No hat,no cowboy hat, no dancing and the beat is off with her voice.  The song makes no since and the robot satan eye is even worse. She needs a stress counselor maybe.  I usually like some of her music. Her and Taylor swifts new song is also wacked,weird and satan ,evil looking
Is this all she can do is walk in frame, and run her fingers up her body, half naked, and point her finger like shs shooting a gun? 🤣  This is a damn shame! I'm black and she's not country! 🤣😆 Get the Blank outta here with this ! Half naked, what's she trying to sell? I don't like her song. It don't sound country, sounds like she's singing about fancy cars, shooting, like words gangster rappers would use, slowed down with a so-called country sound. 😆 Girl stick to what you know. Because it's not country!!
She ever heard of tin horn?
Why the fuck did she get hit off of this fucktard song? Texas is pretty pissed off right now  Stick to your R&B and country to the country singers
Who else is here from the Tommy J video?
she is a talented musician, dose she really needs to  dress like this to sell the album ????
I guess im a prude. I see this and think is this necessary?
When did Beyoncé become so vulgar and terrible…..😔
This is a stupid loop video. Can't a billionaire afford better than this ?
What it cost to make this video? $500? Lol
Who is here after taylor released new album?🎉
Did she have to copy the Franklin the Turtle theme song?
This is the worst thing I've ever seen in my life. Can youtube  bring back the dislike button so I can see how many other people think this is complete trash?
Why shw dressed like Kanye's wife lol
How can anyone like this music video it's disturbing and she's very disturbed. And she wonders why she never wins album of the year...?? 😂
What a boring, terrible video for a good song. And that "outfit" is ridiculous.
Why doesn't she do the dance ? Because she can't
What the hell is the terminator eye about 🤷‍♀️
Do y'all not know what a visualizer is?
How is this a country song? All she does is mention things that are country - Texas, cards, tornado. All she is doing is showing off her body. Her song has no theme. Waste to even call this a country song. I smell manipulation from her husband
That sucked! Insult to the wholesomeness of Country Music. Go back to your Genre' of Sex, Cursing, Drugs & Killing people. and.....what the heck kind of "video" was that?
When teenage girl role model billionaire musicians become porn stars…
Whose backup singer? not Destiny's Child 😅  that ain't  contry, they'll tweak to it 😅😅😅😅
How to look like a whore example is the entire video. Also country music is not your thing.
What the f***What the f***What the f*** is doing her?E, what the f*** fuck f***What the f*** she's doing?What the f*** fuck?What the f*** s***What the f*** s***What the fuck
What the f*** is that Robert shut up?What the f*** fuck f*** fuck and over?Fuck fuck fuck fucks fucks fucks
What the heck?How did they make that over and over
I don’t see anything wrong with her country music. What’s the problem?
Who came here Bcs of the unis cover
When did beyonce get breast implants They must have gone  sour  after kids and why she mostly naked Was expecting to see some country stuff.Boy was I wrong
I was very confused when I heard this, looked over, and saw it was Beyonce??
How is this not country someone please explain it to me from a musical perspective and do not comment if you don't play any instrument/listen to bluegrass thanks
How do people have clothing on like this, and not have a nip slip? Miley Cyrus was doing crazy wild dancing in the "Flowers" music video, with no nip slip
What the hell did I just watch??😂😂 that's a music video? Lawd, we be skimping these days. Or is it lack of imagination now 😅😂
This is what passes for talent?
Isn’t this the same chick that bitched about “cultural appropriation” for the last decade? Oh, but it’s OK to appropriate my culture huh?
What I this garbage 🗑 Country? Um absolutely not.
Does anyone think this song is a response to sheldon’s radical opinion song called try that in a small town???
When creativity is non existent.  Didn't write the song.  And a shit video dosplaying her narcissism
Who else here Just for the comments?😂😂
Never seen a country singer have to get naked to make their song a hit. Is she selling a song or her body.?
Always keep a black background... sparkle and bling as is necessary... and tho the human body is beautiful... I came here for the song I heard driving in my car... and the DJ said Beyoncé... I was like "WOW"... for real?
Is this really the video for this lame attempt at a country anything? GTFO 😂😂😂😂
Is this not cultural appropriation!? Where’s the outcry? Are they playing Lainey Wilson on BET!? I think not…..
Is this a joke?  That is awful!  Like any true country music fans will embrace this nonsense 🤦🏼‍♀️😂
i wonder how many times it took to get it perfect without her mabambalambas falling out
Is there a complete line dance for this song? I’ve only seen the first part of it. Also why are you half dressed? Not country showing all your stuff. Stay in your lane Beyoncé. Please!!!!!
Why do I always need to see all of her when I see her , put on some clothes damn
Wonder how she gonna play them cards when the Feds pullup?
Video = absolutely  a shit  and a big  one !!!!!!!!!!!!!! i  will never  understand  WHY in  our days the singers should be naked ?????????????????????????????????????
When did Beyoncé become a Borg??
Ppl who keep complaining about the visuals, u were the SAME fkn ppl complaining about NO visuals for act i. She gave us something to better helo us feel each songs vibe and it still aint good enough????
You'd think with that fast song there would be some dancing??
Why do  they  have  her  doing  the  same  thing  over  over
Am I the only one thinking of a sexed up Borg!?
What The Hell Did I Just Watch! If it Don't Sound like God it AintbGod! If it Don't Sound like Country! It Ain't Country! This Sounds like Gay House music!
Ever hear of Black Hawk Down?
Can we just keep turning “The Weekend” songs to country instead?
Who are here in 2024 april?😄🥰
HOW MUCH DID THAT FEW SECONDS COST?!?!?!
Beyonce went outlaw! Is the rest of this album this good?
What a bad role model for her kids 🙄
So horrible. Who is she in this video a saloon girl in the worst bar in town?
So now she's a porn star? What the hell is this supposed to be?
Why did she remake the theme song to Franklin the Turtle?
Why did she even put anything on she already naked. She is a disgrace i am glad my children are grown. No child or adult  should see that.
Can someone gift her a shirt. A button down Texas shirt. Would look sexy and cute. Looking at other women’s boobies is boring never appropriate. Her music will sell anyway so she doesn’t need to be this naked.
why is she so so tacky now i dont cate if the beehive come at me i said what i said
Why do female singers today have to get their baps out? It just cheapens a really good singer and turns the video into a bit of trashy porn. I notice that one of the music channels deemed it necessary to blank out her chest. They must have thought it a bit porny too. As well as that, repeating the same thing again and again is boring. Not to mention the connection with guns. Wrong on all levels!
What a load of crap. Boring. I fast forwarded to stop the misery
What a joke. Leave the country music to the people that don't have to have their books on display to sell a song.  Pathetic!
Are those rich people making fun of us  or what is this?
Do not by tell me that you don’t do the same old , same old sometimes too?  If only I can go to work and just start, pause, repeat!  And get paid!!! She is a genius!
Oh the Choreography…… !? They realy couldn’t give an Eff…!?
what a way to dress Just be a nude model and call it a day.
Who is here after watching UNIS' cover of Texas Hold 'Em  🔽                         🔽
Why is she singing country half naked? And No thanks she AIN'T got a country voice or vibe. This totally stinks like a 3 week olds could egg after Easter that wasn't found. Stick with your original genre Beyonce. It sounds better
You'll know the difference between a visualizer and a videoclip?
What the actual Ffff!!!! Our world is retarded
How many the other American did you kind kill, ( slaves=blacks), to be free Native something, the dead
How does anyone actually like this song
Is this real? Crap song and crappier video. Pretty sad from someone that used to have talent
Why does nobody like her song this is such a good song don’t be mean love from iceland
How is this "Country Music"? ...just sounds like another usual Beyonce song
why she naked wtf she joining the independent wakanda forever womens gang
Who got sacrificed for this one ??
Did no one see the chest filter bugging out?
Is there a way to block a song?
can she sing with clothes on?
Why is she dressed like a stripper ?
Somebody came up with a dance to this, she couldn’t be bothered?
Why is the left eye covered? Seriously, ummm, the Antichrist, your greatest master or savior, Freemasonry, deviation and control over the world and minds, you people must shun the likes of these devils.
Does she really have do that to be popular?  A little sexy is sexier than all icing and no cake. Yuk.
Nice voice but why can't we make it kid friendly?
is this suppose to be country..?
How do you show that much Boob and no Nipple? 🤔
Why do you do it over and over the whole song
Was waiting for the big moment chorus and it just doesnt happen? This is her big single offf this album?? Meh
Why is there even a video??? This is soo incredibly stupid. I'm disappointed. I love Beyonce. She could have done better
I wonder how many nip slips there were before they finished the video
THIS is what is No 1?? SERIOUSLY..THIS  IS HER NO 1?
is the song good?  no    is the video? yes  then i get bored and move on to heabest video game MV ever
what a sad way to go....you did not need to degrade yourself like this...your voice is amazing...this video just turned me off YOU
How is she’s able to wear that outfit on YouTube? She’s practically wearing nothing.
IS THIS IT? Oh wait, no that's The Strokes
Why is this the worst “country song” and “country music video I’ve ever seen. It’s painful
Why dose she do the same thing
Why is she repeating the same thing all the time?? It was just 1 min and I paused the song to think about it
Ok what was that supposed to do?
How can this be number one. Am lost
She's so naked... Why have anything on, if it doesn't cover up anything?
I wonder what Hank Sr., Patsy Cline, George Jones, Loretta Lynn would think of this? No doubt, Beyonce is a great artist in pop. This ain't the country music I grew up with!
What a BAAAAADDDDD song.   And i mean TERRIBLE !!
Everybody goes country. No more hiphop or r&b?
Why does everything have to be so fucking sexual?
What a RUBBISH MUSIC VIDEO! WASTED VIEW
What a slap in the face to real Country music!
Whos came here coz of unis?
Ai. Really.... wanna be no 1 in country too?? Why? Wtf??
I would love to see her do some metalcore stuff lol i know that would never happen but could you imagine?
Is this is???  Her music video???
What about the black panther shot out?
Why isn’t this considered trashy?
Can you stop doing the same move over and over and over again because it's getting kind of annoying and put some clothes on I've never watched you I love the song I Love the song that you make I have never ever seen your songs that I'm going to see them today
When talent is absent, show skin. Gotta be to most overrated person of all time
Why u do the same thing all over again
Is that all she has t/a?
Who does she think she is?
Why is she showing her boobs? That is weird!
Why does this lady always over sexualize her videos?? 😮😒🙄
What was the point of this video, apart from the artist masturbating their ego?
DOES ANYONE FIND THE LYRICS ODD? PERHAPS THINK THE VIDEO IS WEIRD AF!?  NVM. LOL
I wonder how many takes this took lol
So when does she come out with her equivalent of call me by your name?
What did i just watch... the cyborg cowgirl flappy tits aint it....but that tornado lyrics 😂💀this is ass bruh... what is wrong with this girl
What is she trying to do here?  Not a fan
When you learn to make country music from Queen. You get cheap "Fat Bottomed Girls" and even an old UK band can make country music better than this song. Long live the Queen.
Why didn't she just do this from the start after destiny's child...🤷🏽‍♀️
The video for this song could have been so much more. What is this trash?
Can you make another pageant song
Givin me nausea with all the repetition.. who else 😂??
What’s with her outfit???  😩Do you have to be 1/2 naked all the time??
This looks p*rn... What is beyonce doing ? Onlyfans ???
What has happened to us as a society that we are no longer offended by videos like this??  I love the song, but all the nudity, sexuality, is not necessary and I can not find how that represens country music at all.  I'm offended and don't see how in the world this video/song became #1!
What is the point of this video?
Why do some female artist feel they have to get half naked to do a video, if the music is good. That's all you need.  This just looks trashy to me.
I wonder wat artist she took this song from 😂 now who wrote this B
Why has she got all out 😂 no class
how can this be a hit song 🙂‍↕️
What the hell is this crap?
Did beyonce just make a country song?! hahahah i can't stop laughing ...howdy doo yippy kai yay cowboy hahah
Why has she done this?? Country music is shit and she is so much above all that...very disappointing.
Why is she naked? Especially she's not dancing or dressed or has anything providing evidence of what she's singing about
Doesn’t sound even close to country music!???
why you always gotta dress like a ho, let it be about the music.
Why does a beautiful woman have to dress like this 😢
Beyonce doing a country album is the most predictable, outdated, bland trend she could have hoped on and bet she wins awards for it. Also, Lorde did the cheap single outfit video with a black background first, and someone probably before her. She's such a talent; Why can't Beyonce do anything original or fresh anymore?
Why is she half naked?? Real country woman don't do that
I'm not understanding -- can someone explain this to me -- is there a meaning behind the video being on a loop?
She needs to stay far away from this genre, it's not working in my opinion. Country music is known for its modesty, why can't we keep it this way?
Who did it better, Darius Rucker / Beyonce...   Let's not pretend, definitely not Beyonce and her Pop "country"
This is not country..... This is a joke right? 🤣🤣🤣....you can't be serious?
When you try to make money from every style of music you can without actually liking the music you’re making. Very generic.
what I'm watching? some cheap YT porn?
What is happening? Ran out of idea?
Why this woman have to expose her body to prove her talent????? !!!! ????
Why is she so fat lol 😂
Why does she have to appear half naked? This is not country values if she wants to be a country star
Who came here after watching unis cover😂❤ I love the song though. Hoping Beyonce will allow them to do full cover.
What a boring video for a great song
Isn't the covered eye a symbol of Horus and the Illuminati?
Dang, the opening to this sounds so much like the opening to Golden Coast by Billy Shaddox / Billy Midnight that was released like 17 years ago. Did he help write this?
Are you frickin’ kiddin’ me??! Wth is with the stupid “replay”?? I’m waitin’ for some serious dance moves here. 🙄🤦🏻‍♀️
Did they forget the rest of the video? Song ain't bad at all.....but damn.
What are those clothes? Any jeans and tshirt wouldn’t be nicer? The song is very nice reminds me of Shania Twain.
Can someone drop the link for the real video. Thanks
Does Beyonce not make music videos anymore?
What am I Looking at?  Nah ..  not beyonce being cheap
What is she saying? It’s not relatable to the clip or I call it reel. But I can here last word shot
Just coming from a MJ Marathon with most iconic music videos ever produced. WTF is this B?
What is the point of having a video?
What a poor video and such a beauty dressed like a porn star . Why ? great videos of this tune that  the general Public have uploaded on you tube tho ! .
Can someone explain to me why Beyonce looks like she's in a select your character room in the thumbnail. 😂
Nobody cares her body is a "little" too exposed?
I am trying to enjoy the rather cool and unusual song, but I seem to be having a hard time doing that.  Was this really necessary?
Is this a comedy song? What a JOKE.
I wonder who they had to kill to get this song.
who else was locked in on the biggily jiggily
How gonna drop a fucking country song when you do rap that’s messed up bro
What a slap in the face to us independent country artist #Creeksquad #RHEC
Why am I nodding and gulping my drink with hand in the air in my office?
Why do Black women feel like they always have to be naked 😂 this shit is getting really corny 😂
What do you call it when beyonce falls on stage....a ho-down!!!  Shes s trashy lady.  Pretty but still a *o
Isn't it strange that it plays everywhere except country radio stations?
Does she always have to put her junk out there?
Why do you have your boobs out😟
What the actual fuck? That sounds like trash.
Who did it better?  Beyonce or BigX?
Where are your clothes young lady? 😠😠😠
Why isn't she dancing to this song as so many have?
What in the world? JZ better be wearing a cowboy hat!
What does country music got to do with boobs? She is so talented, she does not need to show boobs!
When white people rap or are in hip black people say culture appropriation but when Beyonce does country all these racist mf are silent now?😂 no surprise
I heard that song on the Radio and was like maaan what the hell is that sh... again?
What did I just watch?   I thought my screen was glitching.   What?  Why on repeat?   I get artistic vision blah blah or maybe I don’t because that was an awful video.
Seriously, WTF is this stupid shit?
When you realize that TEXAS HOLD'EM is what she calls that jacket.
Who else waiting for the les twin to scoot across the screen to cover her up
What in thee American prostitution is this? 😂😂😂 Featuring Jay-Z & Diddy
Why does  she have to sexualize everything she does?? Is she that insecure ?  Put on some clothes, and do some real singing.
Does she ever country dance in this video?!!!
Is this considered country now? Yikes.. trashy nonsense.
Was she “cancelled” by the R&B pop industry so she now trying to ruin country? I thought the song was bad but this video is even worse!
Is she a strip dancer of some sort .? Beautiful woman but not much talent
How about an Austin Powers remake😊
When did Beyoncé turn into a town girl😶
Are you afraid people will not enjoy your music if you don't sell your body with it???
when you don't know where you are going ,you end up in some other place...
Do we really need the soft porn to enjoy the music?
Tits, ass and how many producers?  Beyoncé  070 Shake  BAH  Jon Batiste  Cadenza  Cam  Miley Cyrus  D.A. Got That Dope  Derek Dixie  Dixson  Ian Fitchuk  Harry Edwards  Shawn Everett  Nathan Ferraro  Ink  Tyler Johnson  Paul McCartney  No I.D.  Nova Wav  Dave Hamelin  Killa B  Nick Kobe  Mamii  Simon Mårtensson  Pharrell Williams  Jack Ro  Raphael Saadiq  Sean Solymar  Sounwave  Swizz Beatz  The-Dream  Khirye Tyler  Remember Prince and Purple Rain?  Do you remember how many writers, producers and musicians created that album?  Yeah ....that's right. Just one.  Prince himself.  What's happened to music when all you have to do today is shake your ass to win a Grammy?
What kind of MAN allows other men to look upon his wife's nakedness? 😢 WHY?
Why try to be something you are not. I hope the Franklin kids show owners sue you for stealing their song
I meant the performance.. and it’s ok for me to have that opinion. Right?
Is this soft-core porn? I know it's definitely not country music.
Is this the actual video? After the 3rd scene I'm like huh? Has to be the cheapest music video ever made
Who calls this country? this just more that horrible Hick Hop that has destroyed real country. And of course, that plastic sell out old cow Parton helped with this junk
Why are so many southerners triggered by this song?
What a cheap crappy video. They should be able to do better.
What in the end times is going on here? Beyonce is absolutely garbage.
Why no top only a vest jacket
anyone else turn the radio off when this comes on?
Why are you covering your eye!!why are you trying to steal the souls of the pure country folk?? They aren’t gonna fall for that!! Whistle all you want. Try that in a small town !!!!✝️🙏🏼❤️
Stupidest video ever. The woman has a voice, talent and beauty...and she does  this dumb video?
Fantastic music  love it. No need for her to be half naked.. why? Littke girls love B, so why does she have to dress like this?
How much likes I get I’ll do a Ariel promise
Where is the video? Is this it?
Is it about country or sex?
Like the song- still Adele never needs to undress to sell. So what is being sold??
What an imagination!! Couldn’t change it up a little. I’ll stick to SHANIA!!! A million times she’s BETTER!!
Can't  sell your song without you boobs exposed?
Not only is this song kinda meh, But like, Why is she naked? This is a bit lazy dontcha think?
Why is the entire video just 1 clip repeating? This is so stupid, the song sux and this video is just 1 clip played over and over , completely idiotic stupid shit
When she say this gonna take long ok producer mhm do IT for long …… but wtf
What a disappointing video to a great song. That top is too much I'm afraid.
What would John and Paul create if they were asked in their prime to create a country song.  Regardless of the ability to create fast, I don't think Ai would be able to out shine those two.  I personally enjoyed the heck out of this song.  Charlie Pride enjoyed playing pro baseball but not as much as he enjoyed entertaining us with his country music. Beyonce is amazing and creative and I would enjoy it if Charlie was still with us and he and B created a song they sing together.
How tf ppl be enjoying this
Does anyone other than black racist woman still listen to beyonce ?
Why do performers artists now have to constantly look like whores? Ugh
This is the whole video?? Is this official??
Whyyyyyy????? Stop it now. Where you mama???
A snake on the left eye?................... COULD YOU BE MORE FREEMASONIC?
PLEASE DONT RUIN COUNTRY MUSIC...is nothing sacred???
Why she look like a Borg from Star Trek?
Why do you always have to be naked and every frigging thing you?Do you think this is good for young girls to see this?While you're playing with yourself in front of man viewers on the internet.And then what do you think they do when they leave their homes to young girls that are roaming around your former neighborhood when you were poor but now they are, are you out of your mind?Wanted to get your act together and be a role model for young women instead about you know what
I don't get it, what does this visualise?
Who doesn't  like this amazing song ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hello Beyoncé do you like your younger fans, say your daughters age, watching this and modeling after it?
Why can we see your boobies?…..
Sorry but this ain't Country music! This is someone TRYING to write Country music! Not to mention cultural appropriation???
Never knew country can be this naked! Does she really have to do this to sell albums?
What the hell has Oldham a town near Manchester got to do with Texas ?
Is this a joke? Her vocals & lyrics are nothing country & the beat doesn’t work with her slow vocals. Truly a disgrace & diss song to country. 😢
She's REALLY desperate to get those views back from Taylor Swift isn't she?
What a bullshit video. Sad performance. Everybody look on the body, nobody listen to the words.... no message, only titts. Sad mummy-message.
Why is she half naked? Blacks make everything ratchet wtf
why is it that women as they get older have to try and show that their body hasn't fallen apart yet? Body looks plastic. Not country at all.
Is Beyonce running the Thunderdome now?
What does it mean to have a repeating over and over again? I don't get it.
Is this a music video or onlyfans?
Why does she have to be naked?
What a steaming pile of shit this is lol wow
this stripper really can sing...who is she?
Love the song, hate the video. Enjoyed watching Ugandan children dancing to this better. What happened to your outstanding choreographer?
Why does she look like an AI country BOT!
Why dont beyonce leave country music alone
was this a joke or satire?
Anybody for talk of CULTURAL APPROPRIATION? Or does a BLACK woman, Beyonce, get all kind of passes?
I’m a liberal person but I’m sick of her  barely having clothes on.  What message are you sending to your daughters? Sex sells and your vocal talent isn’t enough??
What the hell would she know about country besides music, I bet she's never done a hard day's work in her life, she's probably never even been on a farm.
Where are your clothes woman. And to think you are a role model to millions of people 😢 failed society. Well done
Can't stand her, but this song is not too bad. Maybe she should try doing country?
Is this getting air play with the lyrics as they are?
She needs to quit worrying about trying to make country music and get that husband and hers under control, you know how many times leaves on Epstein's island, so she's married to a pedophile. She better watch her children, and was best friends with p Diddy?
What are you wearing??? Buy a mirror stop letting people tell you you look good. You got money they lie.
What a time to be alive ❤
Is the video stuck ????? Wth ??? Over n over 🙄😒🙄
When a grown women has completely sold out and is grasping to stay relevant, it’s quite pathetic in my opinion. She’s gotta be half naked just to get views cause even she knows the song is straight garbage.
What we have here is failure to Communicate
Why you sing about my ex gf? This song got a bit but this is what Country is: https://youtu.be/ZdKzbF7j4Zg?si=m8N9qZQZbv0fTvrw
When you ask ChatGPT to write your songs.
Ay so is her husband part of the sex trafficking too ?
when this disgrace comes on the radio i have change the station
Why is beyonce singing country😭 (Ik someone already commented but my god)
What in the world is the point of this being played on loop for the entire song?
I wonder if you all are seeing what I'm seeing in this video? Beyoce is slacking in the top ten. I'll tell you why, she's about to bring out a new album, so she's creating some dust.
What she's  wearing is gross....
Why is that old lady almost naked?
What in the holy hell is this crap 💩
I like Beyonce its just she got so much trust in that vest jacket than i got in my life and universe but she got a shirt or no?
I don't get it. The video sucks. I can see naked broads anywhere - I mean, absolutely anywhere - and far better lookin' ones too. So wtf... ?
I like country, but what is this?
Oh this is an awful video. Can anyone explain why it’s the same all the way through… over & over again??  What M I missing?
What is up with this video the song is not bad not country but not bad but the video is terrible
How is this good music? Like brub, this isn't even good
Why would that skanky outfit represent country ? Not starting an argument- just an opinion. Song is great but try to be as naked as you can without being naked Husband said something I won’t print as even I was offended. Now go post your own comments. Everyone is entitled to an opinion as long as h as it’s (husband) not (husband) derogatory. (Husband) 😅
Pop trash. Where is the talent?
Why she is naked? Does she need this?
Why she s still speaking???? 😂😂 cringe artist
Why are these celebrities always thinking that it's okay to ruin what is not meant for them. You don't see female country artists tramping around half naked. 😐🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 You are no country artist stick to R&B
Is that real? Or I am just dreamming? Is it organiz? You know what I mean….🎉
Why did Jay-Z abandon Rock music?
What if the vest falls off
Why does she have to be practically naked?  Love the song but seriously?!
Why are you trying to be country you are sooo good at pop and you are bad at country you are only singing for more followers and it is annoying
What does this video have to do with the song?
First time hearing.. that’s it? Just Beyoncé doing what countless have done before? No innovation?
Why am I watching a loop rn 💀
Is this even called a video??? Waste of our 3mins of our lives watching a 10aec action repeatedly. 😮
Why is she wearing that thing on her face and shooting out of her finger after she fondles herself? She reminds me of the terminator but female .????
Why the f*** do you need to be naked for country music too?
Oldie here…What is on Beyoncé’s face?
What am i watching over and over again?
Anyone else thinks this music video is crap?
It's so nice to see a black artist making country music to take ir back to black people así they invented it and White people stole it.  But Beyoncé, if you care about black people, why does tour clothing brand (Ivy Park) is made with slave labour in África? Those black people don't count?
Is this the whole video? Lol
Where is the Country in her voice???Still sound R&B/rap
Fan fact: MTV censored her breasts cleavage although nothing explicit is shown. WTF?
Why is the playlist all out of whack?
why is "my house" not on the album???
Why are you naked that is appropriate it's a baby appropriate
Why do all these songs sound like they were recorded with technology of the seventies 😂
HOW THE HELL IS POSSIBLE ONLY 25MILL VIEWS???!!!!!!
Damn… she needs to find some Jesus! What in actual fuck????
So, is the actual video? If so, where is the rest of it?
When I say I really like this sing 🎤 ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️‼️ I don’t care 🤷🏽‍♀️ what anyone says about Beyoncé, but one ☝🏾 thing no one ☝🏾 can’t deny is this Girl been on a different level her OWN LANE ICON LEGEND A BEAUTIFUL GIFT A BOSS ALWAYS WORKING HARD HAVING HER LEGACY ALREADY ON LOCK 🔐. Super proud of Beyonce’ an her amazing accomplishments isn’t no where over yet. You go Bey 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾💯💯💯💯‼️
What an embarrassment. She looks terrible
Why do women always have to appear naked?
What the fuck is this, Jesus Christ 😂😂😂
Who is listening to the entire album without skipping
Who let her make this terrible song?
Is she trying to follow Taylor Swift's success ? 🤣
Did she just copy the intro from Semsi Yastiman- Uzaylilar Hos Geldiniz?
Oh my, this poor lady lost her eye sight, has to wear a patch.  And damn, somebody done went and stole all her clothes!!!    Ya'll think anyone should tell her that H-do went out of style about 40 years ago?
When Beck released morning phase, the whole country vibe was perfect with his voice and payed respect to the genre. This is just pop music with a different take / twist on it, wich you like or don't like. Im in the last category.
Does she have to be pornographic to sell a great sound?
Who knew she was from texas.  Not her fans, until now.  It's too commerical.  And the biggest point of all is the music is horrible.  Probably because her heart is not in it just her wallet.
Are we this desperate for a new song or music??? Im not lol
Who pays money to listen to this shite 😂
Beyonce really dont mind about MUSIC VIDEO???
What a shit video. Adds nothing to the pop trash song which is just racial appropriation for commercial gain.
Why are so many and about this song? In my opinion it’s fine, it’s not your typical country but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t hate it.
POV: im the jacket 🧥 Do you really trust me?
How TF is this country geez slap on a hat and say Texas is country no way no anyhow stick to what you know country music is a life story not some game look Hank Williams Johny Cash or Hank Snow or Hager and Jerry read real country not some city crap.
Who is here after the album???
Can you do one song without your titties hanging out
What this song is trash what the heck you guys idiots
What in the country Fack is this? Lol 😂😂
Who told blud to sing country 💀💀💀
Is there any genre can't fit in? She's MUSIC!!!
what if this was made by ai
What in the country sh*t is this???
How about respect Country Music and putting more clothes on. It isn’t the right outfit for Country but ONLY for her regular music. Great song minus the swear word B**** (which isn’t used in Country music, they do swear but not in this way) sexual mentions and sounds.
You definitely are not Country! I do not agree with your decision, stick to your music, did you forget your talent  you are a master at your own music. What are you doing ????
who is ready for Tomorrow cowboy carter album 🎉?
Are you trying to say something with this song ? What are you guys gonna do in Texas????
Who gives a shit about duct tape,ddble sided, whatever. When was country music half naked ppl on their .
Why does she need to not wear a shirt!  Great song but video 🤬🤬🤬
It's such a nice song. I wish she made a video way better than this one. From the start to finish, geee!are you kidding me?
I wonder if he was respectful to them young crying girls
What a horrible video… worst ever
I hear Louisiana by Reyna... Was this inspired by that song?
Just came here to say how trash this song is.. wtf is this???
big question is will she ever stop doing bukkakes?
She looks like a porn star!!! Why?
How is this country? It's another artist spitting on country music thinking they're making country music. Please stop. Have some respect for your body! She could've at least dressed "country" like a real cowgirl and did some country dancing. The girls that were in brothels back then had more coverage than this.
What the actual frack? I like the song but this video is a bitch.
What a sad attempt to break into whatever she was trying to break into. She should probably stick to whatever she was doing before she made this song. What a waste of space.😂😂😂😂😂😂
That's it for the video? What happened, Is she broke Or just stopped trying?
I was expecting a video. It's just a loop of her walking?
Can't she put some underwears like any standard singer????😢
I wonder whose idea was this that she has to be half naked she’s beautiful she might as well just start posing for Playboy, but I guarantee she was made to do it like that
Nasty put some clothes on, why don't you?
Do Texans really enjoy this music ? For me it’s a parody of what country music really is
When you don’t put in effort, you get this crap…..
Where are your clothes???? Do you really have to swear too🤦🏽‍♀️. I’m not racist, before anyone decides to come for me, just curious.
Who came here because of TikTok
What a boring video to watch! The song is ok, though.
Were is the video  with her singing  it ?
Who is listening to this song in 2027
Who is listening to this song in 2028
Who is listening to this song in 2026
If you're going to genre hop to grab cash, at least make a decent song.    also, you're aware that any real cowboys of the time would shoot you dead just for being a n*****?
THIS ISN'T COUNTRY THIS IS HIPHOP BEATS AND ITS JUST AN AI NOT A REAL VIDEO WTH?
Why do these stars always have to be practically naked to perform… corrupting young people once again with another genre! The song is horrible and not country … just another pop sound for money!
I love Bey but for the life of me I don't understand why the beyhive Don't be going after Jay-Z Epstein??
Why is she wearing her panty hose backwards?
How damn embarrassing and sad lady this isn't what country is all about put clothes on that nasty crap
Why the same moves every time
They spent like 5 minutes writing lyrics and 10 minutes shooting the clip. Are you kidding?
I wonder how many takes this took because the jacket fell off
Is this all the video is? Just Queen B walking up half naked, with fake hand gun finger that "Kapow" like a pop gun? Kinda disappointed B!
U bleached your skin for this garbage?!?
Lame, what’s next, death metal?
Where is the pole she can swing on?
Wow!! The BET awards, Grio, NAACP etc need to add a country music section to encourage more and more blacks to sing this genre. They should also give a history lesson during the induction of it. Im in my 40s and I have always liked country music since I was a child. I have always liked country, folk, rock and roll ( 60s, 70s and 80s rock), jazz, RnB, etc. I had no idea that a black man Deford Bailey was the first man ever ( no matter color) to sing country music and was the first person to perform at the Grand ole Opera. Can someone contact these awards and ask them to develop the “Deford Bailey country music award”?
What a rubbish this. Music industry ran out of good singers.
Can some one please explain the lyrics ? Because I dont understand de meaning behind. Whats the thought ?
Do people actually think this sounds good or does it only sound good because Beyoncé did it?  It’s just like Ariana yes and. If any other unrecognized not yet famous artist did it, I’m sure they wouldn’t make it up there
Why does she sound like Shakira a little bit
Great song, but why the boring video?
When the music is just musicing 🥳🤠 Beyoncé's mind
Is this the music video? Songs ok videos crap, she getting a bit like Madonna ...we've seen it all before love , put it away and have some class
Could this get any worse? Terrible aong, terrible 'video,' Pathetically stupid lyrics.....
Who just can’t stop listening to this masterpiece?
What kind of stupid video is this?
Who is listening to this song in 2025
Is it just me who's heard the first part of this song before?!?!? I feel like I'm going mad.
What the fuck is this shit
Can she cover up? Kids see this.
Why is she PREDICTABLY half naked in a Goofy Costume .. . .    again ?
What the hell is this clip? ☹️
Who in the hell told this women that she can sing country music cut the crap off keep doing watchu doing but don’t disrespect country music like that
Why she only making country music am not hating just asking
what kind of nonsense video is that?
Who’s listening this song in 2030???
What in the world kind of city crap is this. I'm sorry for all of the Beyoncé fan I enjoyed her music growing up but this is junk music.
nice song. dont expect this from her. but why half naked?
Can she just sing without showing her ass or boobs?
Why has she her breast out for a music video why is it allowed my son who is 11 was discussed.
Is there only one way to keep people’s attention, through nudity?
So is there a real video to this song or just the repeat weird thing?
Is this video just her walking with her boobs showing & her playing with herself?
Have we mentioned another issue related to Taylor Swift yet? Complete change of genre? TAylor wins and we have to listen to jz whine about how unfair the world is... if you can't beat them,  join them...WOO-WOO-WOO
Could you be ANY less classy?  Oh and this shit ain't a country song.  A banjo a country song does not make.
What the luck. No. Never. Asinine
What a waste of time  is this video. So completely not country. I have no idea why she did this. What was she thinking?
Did A.I. write this song? Cuz.... Yeah just seems like a terrible attempt to appropriate country culture.
Was it the Choreographer’s day off?  Seriously disappointed!  👎🏼
Why does she need to show her boobs in the video? It looks ridiculous.
Why why you even more naked
She has a great voice. Why dress like a hooker?
so no-one says anything about 'cultural appropriation'?  is it because no-one cares about cultural appropriation anymore? or that no-one dare say anything because it's beyonce, a sacred cow if ever there was....?
Who is listening this song in 2024
What the actual FUCK is this song and music video
What an inspiration to young women, you want attention as a women, you show almost your tits!
Why she like to show her assets to people? Her children are watching mommy go naked.... 😢😢😢😢😢
when the budget is $2.06 and a 2 year old mcdouble.
I wonder how much she paid Blanco Brown for this because it’s clearly The Git Up song. I love what she did with it tho
How many pro-blacks are pretending they like this hot garbage because they feel they have to in order to be pro-black, and how many white liberals are doing the same thing in order to be inclusive and anti racist? Because I don't believe anyone actually thinks this is good music.
What a disgrace to country music.
Is it country because of the fiddle and Banjo? If you replace that you can get a normal pop song out of it… the lyrics dont even do it. The end is straight pop. Maybe i am just confused. Add a folk guitar, take out some instruments it is folk. Hey take out fiddle and banjo,  add bells and its a christmas song, with texas lyrics. Just because you name it a certain music style it is not automatically. There is no country feeling and no country attitude in this siong and im not american and see and feel that. Btw song is ok as pop..
Why she has no shirt I am 8 yo
When you aren't relevant anymore so you take your clothes off and have somebody write you a horrible country esque song ......
Am I supposed to like this just because she is Beyonce?
Why does she have to be half naked to make this song?
What makes her think everyone wants to see her cleavage 🤔🙄
She Can’t afford a shirt? Or even a bra?
Why is the video just a repeat of tits mgee? Had a minor in the room when I started this
I have nothing against the song, but the outfit …really?
Least possible they could do here. Not even trying but forcing everyone to embrace this country song. Is this a joke?
What would make it better if she would open her jacket just a bit more 😂
What is the point of this video? Half naked... dissapointing
Why does it feel like Beyoncé simps be loving this the video  If you know you know
Why is she white and hates whites?
Are we gonna see her dance to this song? Something along the lines of: If u liked it then u shoulda put a ring on it. But country style. I'm waiting patiently.  😂
Sooooo… nobody in the comments can see this symbolism???
What type of video is this?  Just weird, although I really like the song and Beyonce's music.
Is she making FUN of country? I heard she had a country song, thought I’d check it out! Didn’t even listen all the way thru, had to turn it off
What’s the point of the repeat video?
Listen to what you want but please do not bring the swearing "B" and "F" word and everything else in other music genre's that are offensive to most everyday people.  Country does not represent classless, tawdry and inappropriate words and actions. Country  is a genre of music that has deep deep roots in  Negro spirituals, gospel, folk tales & folk songs & traditions. Music evolves. I get that but it is disrespecful to bring country music down to match other morally offensive music? Hearing how some music has evolved makes my ears bleed.  Why do you want to lower yourself and your talent for low class shock value?
WHAT IS SHE WEAR THIS IS YOUTUBE SHE CANT BE DOING NO BOUCY DEAKY HOUSE???
Weren't you the Church Sacutary?
Do not get thai clip ??? What hell going on
IS A GOOD EXAMPLE THIS ? You must choose good words... example for Kids for youngs  what you teach people? I HOPE GOD OPEN YOU R MIND AND HEART.AMEN
Why she doesn't want to release a videclip for her singles? Bow down this new concept, we want a video!
Has anyone told B she is a gest in this country shit? Just as eminem is a gest in hip hop? Hahaha people are fucked she smashed this country shit just as em smashed hip hop. Fuck skin colour. Nothing but love ❤️
Why is she naked and cussing in the song? Tacky.
Why is pornography allowed on youtube? Put some clothes on and have some decency. Also go back to hip hop. This isn't country.
Why is this a country song? because it has a guitar and a clap beat? This aint country 😂
She doesn't need the jacket. My question is, why the jacket??
Why bother with clothes any more.. you have shown the world your goods ..have some respect for yourself for crying out loud.  And the song is crap.
Okay I don't get the outfit, why is every singer as they age need to show more of their flesh are they that insecure?   A era of don't subjectify me, but YET?
So... is country popular now or something?
What a joke... What a dirtbag.  That's some innovative choreographer, such a smash of eclectic moves and even a plot ! Ridiculous
Why is it just the same thing over and over
You come out in some lingerie and shoot a pistol? What kind of video is that who er?
Why do artist feel the need to bare everything.  I'd have more respect for her if she had a really sharp country outfit on that represented TEXAS and not trash.  She's such a FANTASTIC singer, she doesn't need to show all.
Why u think u have to show ur body
This song is amazing. But I don't understand why she has to be half naked to sing it?
Sorry Jay Z. But Beyonce and Country music? Not feeling it. Kacey Musgraves, Carrie Underwood, Miranda Lambert and others, have paid their dues, in country. Those songs are rich in country struggles life and loves, much like hiphop, and R&B. Country music is sacred. So out of respect, you shouldn't cross genres. Then again, if you're cool with Taylor Swift hiring Pharrell, to produce funk tracks she sings on black radio, I guess you can call that progress, too. Right?
What the f*ck is this No-one  talking about her showing her boobs
How does she get her nipples to not slip out?😶
Didn’t she used to be black?
Where's T-Pain country songs?
When I hear this song it reminds me of the hey it’s Franklin theme
Why she have to pretend to be a porn star for a music video
Where in the hell are people getting the dumb dance from this is embarrassing
Why is she dressed like that? Looks like she's trying to sell sex than music.  Uncalled for.
So, she got so poor, that she had to use the same short clip, to make an entire video?
She doesn't seem to have a nipple does she?
So you have to get half naked to sing a country song?
Where’s your boots and clothes?
why is beyonces version of country giving adele so hard
Why is this not cultural appropriation? Because she's black and black people can get away with fucking anything!!
is this video just looping all the time?
Why almost  naked  it s for a western or a en erotic movie🤭🤔🤣
Is that how Texas women’s dress up?😏😏 looks too cheap.
Expected to see western outfits and a row of dancers. WTF is this?
WHAT THE HELL YOU DOING  beyonce???  What the hell are you doing...  dont be pathetic....  be true to who you are ....
What the hell? Hollywood is so weak now.
Why does this sound like that song i don't play video games no more😊
Why is Beyoncé just like that?
I wonder who wrote her song for her or stolen it 😅. I am back so far I search it lol it says "Nathan Ferraro", helped her for this song
Love the song, is this the real video?
Who let this woman butcher country music put some clothes on weirdo
Its kinda catchy, whats the beef with that song ?
What the fuck why is she not wearing a shirt?
This is the best the producers could do with the video? Repeat the same stupid pose?
Where is the video of her actually dancing?
What the hell is this video supposed to be is she a futuristic time traveler who plays shitty attempts at country music
Why does she think she have to half naked?
What actual human find this to be catchy or well done. It comes off as such an obvious grift.
Why is nobody noticing what she is wearing ,like just put some clothes 🤣💀💀
First of all, why half naked?  It's a great song but not sung by her.  Can't she just disappear?
What a disappointment of a video. I really thought you wld make a great video not a point shot of herself.
Why do we have to be subjected to nudity
Why are these satanic signs again?
what is that music video so annoying song
What the hell is this crap is people running out of ideas.
Why is the video on repeat?
Does she not know list is a sin? I’d be so embarrassed to show my body off to the world like this. Her husband and children should be embarrassed of her. Have some class for your body.
Is it important to show them body in them songs??
black women want respect, yet their 'queen' always try's to show all she possibly can? What happened to talent without being naked?
Is she singing "it's a fucking Lexus"?
What a bloody disappointment of a video
I wonder why nobody talks about all her nips and tucks she don had a ton of surgery I'm sure
What is this….. a thirst trap where is the music video
Who came here bc of The meme 😂
How about you STOP acting country you are a joke
How to tell this "crossover" song is BOMBING and her "country" album is sure to follow?  There are at least half a dozen "official" videos.
Why ya naked?   Good music doesn't need antics
Has anyone noticed that the vid is a repeating feed?  Just saying.
Whye do people write an entire thesis in a comment section?
why are you  amost showing your melons
Not country? Who in the world doesn't get music genres? If it's not country, what name are we giving it.....with a straight face, while the lyrics spell it out with every phrase?
why does my stomach hurt.... these notes
what the hell is this sex sells not the music
What an evil batch. So many illuminati symbols 😂
Why is she half naked. She is so talented she doesnt need to shoq her boobs like thay
Sweet Bee-Haww shook my mouth and slap your grandma. 😂  Who is pickin' on them strings?
What a great impersonation of Dolly Parton. Well done tribute to the Queen of Country Songs.
What a lame ass video. Nice try honey.
What the hell is this shit because this is more like a rap and a strip show but y'all want to consider this Beyonce's country music  😂😂 she should really stay at what she's doing good at and countries not it
Where the short of him hitting his shots tho, I think that’d get more views
Black Americans created the country genre too! What did the oale people do again other than slave and pillage?
I like this song but why do you have to be naked?
“Official Video” why on earth waste time and resources for a constant loop of visual?
What a stupid artist and song
What kills me with people is when they always come to say oh they're tired of the norm from these artists and when they step outside of that Norm and try a new project its THEN  oh its giving not what the project is and that's crazy to me and I love this for the artist who are stepping out into other genres and doing their thing I definitely hear country listening to the song and why? because I listen to Beyonce and I know what she's capable of and this is very different that's how it sounds different from what she's usually giving so it definitely sounds country to me. ❤
So we just gonna ignore the fact that she doesn’t have a Belly button?
What is happening?? Please make it stop and go away
Why is it a short clip on repeat?
When she said ”this aint texas, aint no hold em”  I felt that.
Why does it hafta be about showing nakedness. Does nothing for the tune. Always the same these days. Put some clothes on!!! Otherwise I liked the tune.
What is the main thought of this song ? I done get it at all  I cant tell what it is about even if I try …
Nah. Don't like the song; cannot hold a candle to REAL country singers. Plus, does she have to be practically naked?
Is this supposed to be country music? Hank Williams Sr and Merle Haggard are rolling over in their graves, this is pathetic.
What a dumb*ss this music is the music from Franklin the kids cartoon 😂
Why am I watching a repeat!!!!! Over and over
Is she really trying to break into country? This song is proof that she’s not invincible and this video is pathetic.
If you just say there's a tornado on her titty?
Where my Alan Jackson fans at
I wonder if she's wearing a bra 😂😂
WOW this sucks and people really like this??
Sorry but who in Texas drive a Lexus ?
Who made the song? It is a hit
Cant just fucking call it a video?
Why do her boobs have to be the main attraction??? Seriously
What a mockery of real music.
Why she can’t be bothered to wear anything ? Rich ppl like to be naked with all that money! Crazy
When is the Music Video release!?
What was she thinking ??? This seriously sounds like total shit
Does anyone remember the name of the radio station... Never mind. I'm sure Bey was grateful for that little bit of controversy. 😂... Whooo!!!
Is Beyonce trying to be white singing g country music?
What a song this it is some thing went wrong
Has country music also sold out, becoming a nude show? I always believed country music to be conservative but eish that's gone to
The song is fine but I don’t think she needs to dress that way.  Just my opinion.  Why?
Beautiful lady, great voice. Why does she have to dress like a call girl?
How is this a country song?
Is that all it takes to make a video, walk out on stage half clothed, never say a word, and do it over and over and over again??? 😮
Where is k michelle.. Beyonce song is bull shit My 5 year old can do better the f*** out of here. Y'all listen to anything She needs to go sit the fuck down
was she styled by Kanye? Or did she just forget to get dressed?
Why can't we get more action in this video
Can't she at least put a shirt on??
How the hell.... The jacket wow only she can get away with that!
She's getting older May be she only got that one move left?
What the hell is this? We're the rest of the video is a loop, definitely she didn't put a lot of tough on the lyrics as long they were rhyme she was ok 😅
We're you held at gun point to make this?
How many tries did it take to get the shot of her walking without Uhm.. something to be seen?
Why kind of shit is this song?????😢😢😢😢😢😢😫😫😭😭😭😭😭
Is this even considered a video of A list artist's?  Probably voice manipulated
Love the song, the arrangement, the harmonies, her talent and voice- but WHY this raunchy get-up????
Is this it? The video? Really? I was soooo impressed with the song. Was going to post my appreciation until I saw this. Wtf🤷‍♀️ Is this the entire video or is it some sort of preview thing?????  Ok!!!! Update, phew, yes this is basically a preview promo. Jesus lol.
What a let down. B is capable and we expect so much more from her. This is a cop out. I nominate this video for a Razzie!!
Who came up with this video ? Terrible!!
Question?in Texas do they walk around like that with their breasts uncovered?
Why it's vibing me of ‘GTA SA’
how much is tiffanys etc?80,000$?
The first line refers to Poker?
Anyone else hear the Lumineers Ho Hey?
This is the worst supposed music video ever!  Is this supposed  to be talent?
Bayou influences and sounds. This is not southern country why is people mad and if it was still why?
Does she got to go naked to sell this album?
Who wrote this song? Really she put this song out😢
Is she making fun of country music? Or is she serious?
Why doesn’t she put some clothes on. So unnecessary
What in the actual fuck is this nonsense?
Did U get my message? LOVE THE SONG ; Praying it will be #1 ; Got to purchase the magazine at CVS;  PHILIPPIANS 4:3-5 Gentleness  1 John 5:20 2 John 1:1-6 Congratulations Beyonce on  Being a Mom and a Successful Businesswoman  Happy New Yearsssssssssssssssssssss amd Happy Women's Month March 12 2024  TO do List: Concert
I just want to know how does she feel about her daughter and son seeing her mom's boobs like this not really a  role model put some clothes on you've got a great voice why do you think you have to be naked to sell music ?
Is it Pop Music or Porn?
I’m confused. This is the same scene over and over? Maybe this isn’t the original video?
Is that the whole video? Just the same clip over and over?
What a whorish power hungry individual
What the hell is this video?!
Is this really supposed to be country??
Why is she dressed like a P....Star ??? 🤦‍♀
WTH? Did she lose a bet or something?
Didn't she sing a song with the words that says " Nasty. put some clothes on I told you.."? Fame and money always find a way to skew your morals....
So Beyoncé basically wrote the lyrics like her usual type of songs but just made a “country” melody and sang it in a “country” tone?
What the actual hell is this?
Put some clothes on girl.Dont you get enough attention?
I guess beyonce is country now?
Should I report this cuz I just wanted to listen to music but then I saw this?
Why are y’all so dumb in the comments, and y’all old and white to hating😭😭😭
The song is great.... but is that the official video??
How is this the video? Wtf??!
What a stupid video..why not show her singing the song for godness sake
So it's okay when they culturally appropriate?
What the heck is with being half naked?!? 🙄
Is she starting to go country? The song is different. The video is (I hate to say this...) it is boring. Showing the same thing over and over is not very entertaining or eye catching.
Awful. With all the shootings going on, WHY would she do something like this?
Why do we have to make trash out of everything!
What a disappointment of a video. Good hook tho
What a disgrace. Her and her husband need to go back to where they came from in the music industry. She doesn’t belong in country. Thank god that they don’t play non of her crap on the country stations here
This is the Franklin the Turtle theme song. Wtf is she doing??
Why is this the theme song to Franklin
What a load of s**t 😂
Why is she dressed like that though?
What are you communicating Beyon? Their  other Platforms for this type of content or sensual expression.
What the hell did I just hear? That is horrible what and insult to country music. Wow
What does her dressing half naked have anything to do to with this song
how did this beat so many good songs for #1 on hot100
Why did This song blow up?
What happens to the clothes some one need to donate her a dress to cover her body😢the body reveal is unnecessary with such a good voices. Very sexualizeeed
What is she actually doing?! Phone it in huh?
Is there an actual need or reason to dress like this for a "country song"?! Anybody realize how this is a literal rip off of the Franklin Turtle theme song from the cartoon?! It's not even original...jeezus....🙄🙄
When a heard this song...did not know who it was..catchy tune.😊
Does anybody else hear the intro to Fred Penner‘s place? My wife says everyone is comparing it to the Franklin cartoon.  Pretty sure the folks who made that cartoon were Fred Penner fans.
Is it just me or are main stream music videos getting lazier and lazier every year?
Did Nvidia get a share for the physics of the "pair"?
what was the song' orijinal version? I can't remember.. Adele?
For years and years I've been asking myself: Why do women have to be naked all the time when they're selling their song?
But why is she dressed like that, TRYING to sing country?
Why you trying to sound like Rising Appalachia?
what the HELL!!!  yea sorry stick to what you know.
WHAT ON EARTH .  WHO  ARE YOU TRYING  TO IMPRESS.   . LOWCLASS.  YOUR   DOGGY  HUSBAND  WITH  STILL   CHEAT ON YOU ...
Are we sure this is country?😮
Is this someone’s Only Fans account? LOL
She doesn’t have to dress like this to sale music. Her singing talent alone would have sold millions. Why does she have to be half naked to advertise her first country song?
What a pity Beyoncé now feels the need to ruin and absolutely fabulous song by dressing in such a demeaning and disgusting way.  Is she so insecure about her product she feels the need to sell her body for views?  She has gone from an icon to a cheap joke.  Sorry but video clips like these are adding to the demoralisation of our society.  Her attire is not representative of what the country scene and country people are about and she should feel ashamed trying to represent it.
Worst song you've made 😂😂😂   And why are you naked?   You can only sell music if you're naked?
How is this country ? Because it has a banjo ?
I like the song. Won't download because I don't support her. Why tf is she dressed like that?
:30 seconds in… what the hell?
What Country singer dress like this?
That's the best film clip she can come up with???
I’m obsessed with song but don’t get video? Is it same thing over and over again?
This is horrible wtf Beyoncé and Taylor Swift switch genres or what?
Is this all she doing in this. Video???? No line dance???? I like the song, but the video is lame! 😮😢
Is that it? That's the video? Is this a joke? ...
Whats up the 10 second loop?
Sounds like a country song to me....I wonder if the radio station that refuses to play it saw the video first?
Is this shit supposed to be like country music or something?… what a shame.
What kind of crap is this 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i heard better country music...and why does she needs to be dressed like this...half naked?
Is this a video?  Ok if it is, then it sucks!  🤮🤮🤮
When you can’t beat Taylor Swift, you switch genres.
Why dit they make here do the same thing the hol time
Why is her skin white now?
Why is it a,lazy video production? You've made countless dance moves fir other songs
I like the song, I hate the porn video!  LOL!  Why?!?!?
when I say I hate country music never EVER am I talking about this.
who will listen to this song in 2030? Rise your hand please✋
Why you got to be half naked for this song WTFH IS WRONG WITH YOU
Imagine having as much money as beyonce. And then having the talent to make this the best song she's ever made. And still she has to resort to dressing in a most disgusting manor. Why?
Why the need of nudity and sexuality? She thinks her music isn't good enough? Bc for me this is overcompensation....
How disappointing. Thought that song sounds interesting can’t wait to see the clip bet Beyoncé got full creative lol
Does she have to show so much skin to feel good? She is over rated.
It's not Country, it's Bluegrass.  I can almost hear someone on the washboard.  Perhaps the end time has come after all?
What the fuck is she pulling her 2 fingers out and you can see fiear coming from her fingers so angie what the fuck is shite
but why is she half naked???  if your confident n know you have a good voice n song then why???
What an embarrassment to country music. If you like this song you probably don't know what gender you are either lol
What’s with the g string and boos? I love your music but why do you need that look? Is it a comment on Ai?
What the heck is this??? Country has absolutely lost it's mess. Lord help us. This ain't country and I don't give a 💩 who likes it! Omg
Where it the video for this song? Is she coming out w a whole EP of this album???
Why is this just her repeating doing the same thing over and over. This must have took a lot of thought 🤣
is this how to scam on yt lol? the blur around his face filter lmao?
So why is it that MGK made a pop punk album and he was vilified and everyone said he was "changing genres" but Beyonce can make a "country-esque" song and she's not switching genres and this song is blowing up on Tiktok..... Um... Double standards in Hollywood much?
How the fuck is this country? This is far from it!!!!
Why is this song so ass
Boring video , and why does she want everyone to see a fake boobs???
What husband woud EVER let his wife do this in public?  She is a mother.
What a ripe piece of propaganda notes. The one thing about country music is that it is authentic and this is KNOT authentic AT ALL!
Why is it necessary that she is naked? What on earth.
What is the purpose of sexualizing the song, cover up, it's not about you, it's about music.
Who told Beyonce that it's enough to flash your tits for 4 minutes to call it a video, and people will watch it?   Because whoever told her that, they were right.
Why is she half naked. When did country singers start wearing nothing. She has a gorgeous body and she's looking trashy. The sad part is little girls look up to her and she's okay with being half naked.
Do you even have a bra on? Ewwww
Why the hell I hear the  sweet home Alabama kinda?
No man this music video is soo stupid... is this all she does the whole video through?
How is this outfit considered country
When you're trying to get into country and don't know where to start, steal Franklins intro music, show some skin, and put on loop. Now you got a banger!
I have always liked her voice but why the profanity?
What is she selling here, music or a prelude to a pole dance? catchy tune, but why do all hip-hop r&b artist's have to interject curse words, or do they just have a limited vocabulary, the latter i guess. I admire her talent as singer, not her music choice, nor do I care to see her skin. I guessing her private life is also filled low morals.
As a woman I am FED UP that a female singer has this need of dressing off. Beyonce is called queen B, but she still has this need to dressed off, otherwise she will not be able to sell records. What kind of insecure queen is that?
did Taylor Swift write this? Or is it suppose to sound like a Swift song???
When ppl use your song some of them hate it but i stands up for you:) i love you beyoncē
Sorry for the silly question, but can someone tell me why she has her boobies out?
Why so many haters? I love her, and I love the song.
I think the song is ok...she has always had a good voice...but I think the outfit is unnecessary and over the top....unless looking for some attention...if the song is good and the talent is there...why is this necessary?
Can we just talk about how amazing Beyonces body is looking!!??
why is she a robot tho? song is good but this video is strange
Why does Beyoncé like coming out with the dumbest songs ever SMDH
Isn't this the theme rhythm to that Franklin turtle cartoon?
When you cant write anymore hit songs and your career is in the wind, just strip naked infront of a camera and say your country
Nice song, but why does she look like a Borg?
The music's good. Talent's real. Why be naked?
How about being an example to your little girls! Put some clothes on B!
Why is she singing over the intro song to "Franklin the Turtle".
How to make Franklin theme song to a meme song: Beyonce + Texas abortion laws + Random clips of ppl on Instagram/TikTok "Taking care of their unborns"
why dont she do awesone videoclips anymore??? Only some shitty visualisers???
How dare you show that much skin in a country video. I don't approve at all. You must be the devil.
Is that seriously the best they could do visually?  I was hearing the song elsewhere and liked it but this weird visual ruined it for me.
When is she going to do her own dance ⁉️🤷 because the pictures are not we are looking for from her she can show her body on stage at her concerts, ok like she has always done 👍 come on Bey be nice girlfriend🤷 👍🫶🤩❤
What a state she looks, she really thinks this is cool, disgusting 😠
If white rappers are culture vultures for doing hip hop then is she a culture vulture 2 ?
Why do all these ladies always have to be half naked, is the visual to distract? Also this is not country...its more like bluegrass gospel.
Its a good song, but why does she have to curse through the whole song and dress like a tramp?
Is there an actual video or is it just this intro clip? Kind of dig Beyoncé with a country feel.
This version really sucks. Can you imagine if they had to put their talents to good use have good video this could be?
What is a visualizer??? I’m so confused 😂💀
Why does this song sound like something prisoners would sing while digging a trench with prison guards on horseback holding  rifles waiting for someone to take off running...lol
Does she have to have her fake boobs on show ? Kinda ruins the song
Who wrote this?  Sounds like Mickey Guyton or Alice Randall (?).
Why are you ripping off a child's tv show? And why are you half naked? Doesn't anyone have common decency anymore?
it's a one paragraph song? there is no lyric.. so if it's not texas what is it?
What the hell is she trying to sing country, horrible representation with bad words, and that’s how mothers go out naked … wow this is not worth watching or all the hype whatsoever!
Is this a video???? Country music????
How do her tits look so incredible lol
Can real boobs look like this without support? They are looking like balloons. 🤔
Who tf approved this music video??? Does not go with the music at all...
Her personality think she just should’ve stayed in her lane with her music. This is not Beyoncé. It’s not even a cute tune. It’s stupid. This song is dumb. And the whole gun thing what are we five?
has she ever made a good song since the pink panther song?
How the hell is this considered country music??? Wtf happened to this world
Why she sound just like Sara Evans?
I like the song 🎵 Question... where are her clothes?
Why is she dressing like Kanyes wife?
Why are all the videos with this song better than the songs artist
What does it have to do with her fake breast ?
Why does she keep doing the same thing over and over again??? This is actually the dumbest thing I have ever seen!! You are not country but nice try! Stick with what you know
WTF does this video have to do with anything?
Are we not gonna talk about she barley has clothes on?💀
What's it like to be that beautiful and talented? It doesn't matter if she's "not a country singer." Have you heard of crossover hits? It's a catchy song. Forget who she is. If it's a good song, what difference does it make?
For you racists out there, know that the foundation of country music is that infectious African banjo! Now that you know, are you against the banjo in “your” music?
Why does She have to be half naked all the time🙄
So much talent. Why does she have to be naked?
Is she supposed to be the terminator?
WHERE are her clothes!??!…. Now hollywood/celebs are corrupting country
Why does she look like a cyborg?? THIS is NOT. Country!!!
Why doesn’t this itch stay in her lane..no one wants to see her do this
THEY COULDN'T FIND A VEST THAT WOULD FIT HER?
Beyonce gained what 50 pounds and whats up with this low budget video ?
Are we all gonna ignore the eye candy?
Not really much of a creative video, is it?
What is this... The Voices are getting louder... This is everywhere... This is enough make it stop... It haunts me it doesn't want to leave...  Why is my shorts filled with these... Shorts, tik tok, you made me come here... Make this pain end...
Where did the trend dance on tiktok came from then!
Is she forgetting that children look at her? So sad.
What does that outfit have to do with Country,  she ain’t country either .
When your career stales you either go christian or country. What up Darius!
What a creative video. Seems so much thought went into it.😆
Why is nobody talking about the fact that there is only one shot that is been repeated throughout the video
How is this not cultural appropriation?  I know Beyoncé and Jay Z are RACISTS but where’s the outcry from the public?
Wtf is this piece of shit?
How is this country? Where are the fiddles ? Where is the steel guitar? It isn't very good at all
Did she go to country because Taylor Swift came back to pop? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
When did Beyonce become queen of country music. She really isn't if you have a high pitched voice, then you're not meant for country.😂❤
How did this video get 12 million views. She can make money just with this .
Anyone here after listening to the Franklin the turtle theme song?
How is this song#1 in country . The music people are into these days is a joke
Why wear any clothes at all?
When am I going to get some support 😪
Aren't you embarrassed for listening to such crap?
What kind of garbage is this bro?? Country music gone to the ground
Isn't this the intro to Franklin? 👀👀
Why is the video just her doing the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again?
What is this garbage video? Nice mask.
Great, more shitty pop country and franklin?
How the fuck is this country?
What the fuck is this video? It looks wrong... So wrong. So ..... I hate this industry. Despise it. Despise them all.
How did I come up with avicii😭
I wonder who she is talking about it sounds highly unrealistic 😂😂😂😂😂
Where are her clothes she at least a cowboy hat 😂😂😂
Sounds like the frankiln theme song search it up yall  👇 who looked it up.???
When did it become normal to wear that shit. Children watch this. 😂😂😂😂
she’s basically topless as well .   it’s just a joke on the cointry values she’s not going to dance around like those fools right ?
WHAT IS THIS😂😂😂😂😂 Beyoncé, this is not it. Omg I cringed 😂😂 bring back destiny’s child type stuff, not this😂😂😂😂
What a weird video. Great song. Would loved to see her dancing not just her tits
how is this country? pouring syrup on shit don't make it pancakes.
Why does everybody like her? I don't know why
How long does it take for me to get my health fixed? I know you have not got multiple billions to fix me up but you celebrities might have to do a Poole to help me out for once
She drops this song when the Houston live stock show and rodeo is going on, Love it🫶🏻 Where my Houstonians at 🤘🏼?
is this not the official video? why is that scene on repeat? it's a weird video and looks like brainwashing. i will not be watching the rest of the video. the song and beat is good tho
CULTURAL APPROPROTATION!! Why can't black people let us have anything without trying to copy and ruin it?
Is it just me or did the same clip keep coming the whole time? Love the song tho
How boring and slow are these scientists.... Where's my trillions and cures! I'm going to up the anti. Sorry I'm like this I just need some support. The police was trying to find me a job but I just want my trillions back. There must be a trail. They can be this doughnut dim
Why is everyone so slow at this. I need a new heart, skin, intestines and puss. Tell everyone hurry up. Oh and a hair transplant or weave and my teeth fixed and my tongue fixed.
Why is this song the same as Franklin the Turtle?
What is a visualiser ? If it is an ai generated video , it could have done much better , not that Beyoncé’s producers have a budget constraints . The song gets a thumb up though , easy on the ears ?
Black people are so offended about Elvis apparently stealing black music ….. but they will ignore this ….?
This song gives me we’re gonna have another forced lock down where we will be expected to park our Lexus’s and dance to this song in your own dive bar at home where you get wasted contemplating did I step to the right? I should’ve stepped to the left….or should I have stayed in the middle? Cause don’t be a bitch this gone be a hold up! What you gonna do?
Great song, but why all the nudity???
What a pathetic video. Sings good that's about it.
The song is good, but why is she just standing there in the music video?
What does her outfit have to do with tax?
Why did she mention a Lexus? Texas is known for American made trucks state
Why she doesn’t do music videos for her songs anymore? It’s extremely bizarre
this is not country! give me a break!?
What the bloody hell is this? All she had to do was copy the tic tok and she would have had a awesome dance.
How am i the only one that sees it’s her walking and then a repeat of that over and over again? How is this impressive ?
Why is beonce singing a country song?
What kind of video is this?  Is she sending a signal? I’m totally baffled.
Is she actually saying she hates Texas?
Why can't Beyonce wear some decent clothes?
Idk who wrote this for her by this song is complete garbage, her whole album is  in shambles. All those ghost writers your telling me you can’t make 1 hit?
Why is this song everywhere I hate it if you agree 👇
What the f**k is this video supposed to be? Terrible unless you're just here for the tities.
Why no clothes? It’s a good song. She’s a better country singer than whatever the other music was. I’ve never been sure.
But Beyoncé- why the robotic porno look?
Okay this isn't just me being a hater but am I the only one who thinks this song is way over-hyped?
What the hell is she wearing...how embarrassing for her and her whole family
What a ridiculous outfit for the country song, this is how not not to be taken seriously, also sounds like a mix match of previous tracks
Is this the actual video? This is the most stupid thing I have ever seen.
I’m sorry but why is she always half naked in all her songs😭?
All of a sudden I love country music 😂is this maskandi South Africans?
Didn’t this used to be the “Hey it Franklin” theme song?
How did this get so many likes? Video 🗑,  Song 🗑, Cleavage 🥵🔥
I’m not sure what is happening here but I’m not sure it’s country. Did she say popping a Lexus?
When you realize you are no longer relevant and have to try another genre … not country.
Is she serious?? Give it up Bey and go lay down
Did Beyonce know her record company was doing her wrong? This is the theme song for the cartoon Franklin.
How is this even country? Just bc you’re from a state that is “country” themed does not mean you’re country. She distracting y’all for sum. 💯 you all fell for some trick. lol I find it crazy how Toby Keith dies as well and all of a sudden homegirl desides she’s “country”. Lolll  nah cuh, she about as devoted to country life as nas is to Jesus🤙🏼🤷🏼‍♀️Js
Can I just ask, WHO deemed this "country" ? Was there a vote or something ? Wtf ? Nashville Tennessee born & bred. I know country music & this right here... Ain't.
Trying to figure out why she needs to be half naked?
Why is the whole video the same like 30 seconds over and over
Who cares the genre.  Good song shut up haters
This song hits but what is this mv?????
Is this a joke ??or satire ??
What a poser! I wonder who wrote it for her...cute & good for the dance floor tho.😊
Why does she have her books out
What a joke!! GO Back to your lane. Country music is not in the Illuminati's house.
Doesn't this single have an official music video?
Who else found that YT randomly subscribed them to her channel? I wonder just how many subscribers are bots and people who never subscribed in the first place. YT is a pos also this sounds like that turtle cartoon.
What the f is this film clip about
What happened with the hand hun ?
Don't understand this theme with her getup. How does it match with the country pop up?
When will she put out a death metal album?
Why tf is this all over my fyp?!??
Is this supposed to be a video? No wonder she has never won album of the year. She sucks bigtime!
When millions of people disappear instantly they will say it was alien abduction. But it will have been Jesus who came to rescue his Church before the 7-year Tribulation 🙌
Why does she have to dress all trashy my gosh get some class.
Why the nudity tho 🙄 the song is good enough… no need 🙈
Really? She needed to put the song to porn?
Is this the same person that did that creepy dancing baby meme in the early 2000s? Bc that's all I see in this video.
Music video sucks, what is this??????
Why in the world do they keep repeating the same scene?
How was she able to do a music video with so little clothes and yet it's STILL boring? 🤔 Thats skill or laziness 😂
The lyrics seem to be subtly political.  Is this correct?
What a bunch of shit! Country don't think so!😅
So everyone is saying ahe stole this song from an old Cartoon intro?
When you want to cosplay every musical genre.
This is ridiculous. Is this an actual song? Actual video?
Love the song...and love Beyonce...but is it just me or does this song sound more like Tracy Chapman?
Is the vest the reason this song is so popular?
Did the edit her nips out ?
What the fuck is this shit 😂 this isn’t country fucking music
Beyonce having two kids. Why is she wearing clothes looking like that?
WHAT A STUPID VIDEO.  NOTHING COUNTRY ABIUT IT.   NOW SHE DOESNT WEAR HER COWBOY HAT
What a terrible song and video! That bang and twang sound is not country!
What she mean this ain’t Texas? This is always Texas around here! Nice song still think you are strange.
When she drops an acoustic version bruh, won’t be no question about country
Why she have to dressed like that?! You don't see country women singers coming out half butt naked! This doesn't sound country at all! And she can't carry a tune in this song! Stick with what you know Beyoncé
Why is she dressed like a stripper?  That doesn't go with the song, but the song is okay.
didn't beyonce used to be black?!
Couldn’t she have done a more Creative video?
Why did I know she’d come out half naked😝 stay in your lane.  This doesn’t even sound right. ❌ why tho??
What happened to Epstein island anything to say about it ??
None of this makes sense to me. It's country, but it ain't Texas, there a Lexus and she looks like a Pirate taking hip hop????? Daddy's Issues was on the money. Beyonce had serious cash from 16...she wants to talk Dive bars??? Who write this bullshit??
What in the name of all that is good and holy?!?!?! Some things just shouldn't ever happen especially in the name of money, popularity or tryina out do Taylor. This is wrong
How is this even considered country ?
Continuing into the gutter we go...  This is junk and making fun of an entire genre of music, how are people this dumb?
Is this R&B getting back at the country singers for trying to rap?
Why the nudity 😣 we all can see you through 🙈🙊
Is everyone getting paid for these comments? lol. This song is horrible and the video is too. Seriously putting trashy lyrics into country music. Trying so hard to be where Taylor is and I’m not even a fan of her either
Left eye left arm y'all know?
Why the constant need to look slutty?
What part of the south is that outfit from? 😂
What does having no clothes on have to do with this song?  That chic is wicked to the core.
What a weird video. very repetitive. I give it a meh. Music isn't real creative these days. Too corporate. Won't say it's not a toe tapper, though. I hope she keeps on with the country path and takes it by storm. I just think the video could've been way more creative. Videos used to tell like whole stories. Member berries MJs Moonwalker? That was dope. November Rain, G&R. Sad, but a great experience, and Boys2Men videos had the whole 90s in a clutch wanting to be loved. Lol.
What I wouldn't do for a night...
What are they takng bout we blaks created country too. They always hating. But her lips are💋 not moving, though. 😁😆😅🤣😂
Is this all there is to her video?? THE WORST!!!
Why was it so hard to hear this song on you tube? White gay guy asking... this was good. ❤😊
The clip IS ALL the se shit?
Why dress like that? Song is good,better to put some clothes on
Is this the music video???? If so, terrible!
How is this country? Also she’s a mom, she needs to cover up ffs
Not a Bey fan, but has she always had fake boobs?
Franklin....is that you? What the heck did I just watch?
What a gross video and cover! What an insult to country music. Shame on any country station that's plays this s*&t!
How this went to the top of the charts I do not know. No class!
Doesn't this remind anyone besides me of the opening of The Rolling Stones "Prodigal Son"?
when you sell your soul to the evil, he makes all your dreams come true, because he has power in all sectors of this earth.
Since when does a country boy drive a Lexus?
What the hell crap did I just hear?
Why Is number one this song sounds nothing Country it's not even tht good.
Indecent exposure!  This is like watching soft pornography.  How can videos like this be on this site without some kind of parental guidance warnings????
Are we supposed to be entertained by this redundant video?
This song is almost as good as the video! Trash, is this a joke?
Who would’ve known she would be a country singer? It’s pretty impressive.
Why does she have to be naked....
What Country music?? Hardly music at all. Put some clothes on  look foolish, say u r a queen, industry hv u brainwashed for the 💰!
How do you block a song? I don’t ever wanna hear this 💩again lol
I don't understand what she's wearing. I get the provocative part but I think… How is that country. Just because she's pretending to shoot a gun?
Is this the official video??? Very disappointing..but the song is fire.
Why does she insist on wearing very little, ruins her and the song.
Is it me or is the video just on loop? I thought I was experiencing technical issues with YouTube. 😅
What the fk was that?  That's not country music.
Did Kanye dress her? Looks just like what he’s got his wife and him wearing?!
What a boring video. Everyone thinking all they need to do is show flesh these days to be a success. It’s getting really old 😏
What is this 😂😂😂 Useless and senseless😂😂
Does this count as cultural appropriation? 😆😆💀
What's the point of the video?
uhh...country stations were called racist if they didn't play it, so yeah it was the most added.   The real question is, will they report it as much when it dies quickly because it is an awful song that does not belong on country radio and that actual country fans don't want to hear?
Who else is here to see @Beyonce doing the ritual with the fingers?.
This song sucks… how is it number one?
What A POS. About as country as AC/DC.
What in the hell is she wearing put some clothes on you have children that look up to you and here you are walking around half naked wtf
She's alright, but this is just a terrible song... Wtf?? So poorly written. There is nothing here. Repetitive, Lame. Where has all music gone?
What a weird song.  Don't like it
Why do I have to watch a cyborg trace her breasts and shoot sparks out her fingers over and over. Meh
Nah! Its it about the song or nakeness?
Is it just me or does this song sound just like the “hey it’s Franklin” theme song?!?
Is she Becky with the good hair now?
Had no idea who sang this song. Was listening on my Echo show/TV. Saw the picture on the screen of a mostly naked woman with blonde hair. Now it makes sense that it was Beyonce. Tonight I was excited to see the video thinking I'd see some amazing line dancing choreography... what the literal F?? Worst video ever. I mean I watched the entire thing waiting for something other than her repeating the same thing.  It was a cute into ... but the whole video?? Lame AF. Tiktokers have 1Mx better videos to this song.
Why ruin it with the gun stuff? Aren't we all against that?
Had check this out becauae people all over are making a big thing of it.   So confused by the video. What the...???   The song isn't awful but, the video.   I can't.
Where is the pole dancing and twerking?  Yeah, Patsie Cline would be real proud of this video as would Hugh Hefner.
Why does it just do that move over and over again btw love this song❤❤❤
What happened to her clothes? Did she lose them in a stampede?
I'm assuming the video is to accentuate the boob job?
Why all the pushback? This has something for everyone! Uniter!!
Hooboy.  People with cars on blocks in their yards are BIG MAD about this, hm?
What   Amazing  et  explosive  new song by beyonce.  Over 22  years  career As solo artist  and before  with destiny's group. She still the best et shining artist  and i love again  again
Isn’t this the Franklin the turtle theme song?
What the hell is she wearing?  Has to cover the one eye.  Ooohhh no
What a disgrace to country music…. This is absolutely terrible. And a joke 😂
Why bring half naked to country?
Why does she dress like a stripper, and she should have stuck to the music she is really great at.
Does Beyonce know that she doesn't need to produce a whole song as an excuse to show the world her tits?  Just start an Only Fans like a normal narcissist.  And stop misappropriating my people by wearing blonde hair.  It's offensive.
Isn't she like 60? Put some damn clothes on.
What a joke stick to your nasty music🤮🤮🤮
Why does she always have to be naked? Issues
If I recorded myself doing a poo, added a country instrumental to it and titled it "poo'n aint holdn me down" does that make it country song or me a country singer?
What a dumb hooky song and she looks so trashy.
Glue some metal on your face and do country.. what's she going to rip off after You & I?
Is she #1? in the US? I heard ithe song once and knew it. Now it‘s time for us in Europe. Congrats to this virtuell going timepraking genre you hit ❤️💐💫🙌💫
Will someone stand up at the CMA's and say, Beyonce should have won?
I wonder where the real Beyonce at?!! 🫥 Ole Sasha Fierce has stole the show and gone country with the one eye covered…
Why did she name this song Texas hold em if her first line says "this ain't Texas" kinda silly.
When will Beyoncé and Taylor disappear!! And yes country and r and b and rock are black music at the foundation..but Beyoncé is tired!!and annoying
Why does this song sound like the theme song for Franklin the turtle 😂
How are people saying this does NOT sound country? I hate country music, this definitely sounds country, and its 🔥❤
Why is she dressed like this 😢
I wonder who she stole this song from and refuse to pay royalties to. Sorry but I don't think her voice suits this style. Not impressed.
What in tar nation! This is horrible.
Are you fucking kidding me? Hate it!! This is not country. 😂😂😂😂
Why she got to be naked.. I know this ain't Texas.. But dawn..  She got children, girls too n husband.. heard she Christian.. Like B "U made it, u can put your clothes back on now.. No need to still be stripping in your 40s, yes u look good & yes song is great as usual but now you need to get U some class"
Is this one seen in a loop? Her fans did all the work lol
But could she do it with her clothes on?
What the fuck is this noise stay in your own lane
Is this the video for that? Is so its kinda weird but don't sound too bad
Why does she always have to be nude?
Are you even a singer without subliminal illuminati bs in a video? 💩
When I heard this beat I  thought she was gon start singing     Hays bouncing off my booty....
"Ghetto Country."  Really Beyonce - couldn't make a song without using "bitch" and "shit?"  And she wonders why she doesn't get album of the year. Let's work on getting this shit song out of the #1 slot. Also, the video sucks. WTF is even going on?
where is the video? This is boring as hell 😂😂😢😢😢. I guess if you show your body then you sell more records. But you do sound better Country. Not a fan anyway. The video is funny and sad at the same time.
I don’t understand the video.  Is this supposed to be country music?
Why doesn't she put some cloths on? not crazy about the song.
What the hell did I just watch?? She's damn near naked, why?  Can she sing, yes. Does that mean she's country, HELL NO!! Many TRUE country legends are rolling in their graves right about now.
Why is she arrempting to make white music?
This is such a weird video….also why is her chest like vibrating near her collar bones?
This is a great song. Why is she half naked?
Why is she trying to be white?
lol only good country song u mad right bros?
Is this the official video? It's not great like, I assume it's not
What's with the satanic eyewear?
Anyone else think she sounds like Sara Evans??
So the video is the one scene over and over?
If this is country music why ain't it playin on my local country radio station, hmmmmmmmmm?
So what's so special about this song?
What exactly is country about this song?? It just sounds like shitty pop music.. MGK didn't do well swapping genres and neither did Beyonce
pretty vulgar if you ask me!!But it sells whaT DO i KNOW>.sINGING ABOUT SHIT AND BITCH!!wE HAVE REACHED A NEW LOW!!uSE TO BE SOME COMMON DECENCY!!wE JUST GO FATHER AND FARTHER DOWN THE DRAIN.tHE SONG ISTSELF NOT BAD/bUT WHY SHE NEEDS TO BE SO VULGAR?
Is that song form formation album??? No???? Changed the path??? What happened????? Stick to something one please Beyoncé!!!! Or you wanna steal all music? Disgusting…….
When is the real music video coming out?
Sex sells..,.puh leeze......this is not country music.  Hoe Down?
Why does she have to show half her boobs every time to sell a record?
This is terrible 🤣 how is this country?
Why do you have to make about race? Its a great song but just because she released it does not mean shes reclaiming a black music genra. Same with Rock and Roll! You can claim Rap, Soul to some degree, lets not forget the  Righteous Brothers were white and R&B if you want. But as i said its not about race. Its a about a good song, thats it nothing else!
Wtf did she have to go and copy the Franklin cartoon theme song?
How did she keep that jacket on?  😅😂😅😂😅
@zt Willis so your saying African American founded country and rock and roll that not true . Congratulations to Beyonce in her successful transition into country she deserves it. But the origins or history African American have with country is the cruel slave owners learned to play the banjo through them that’s all and who in country uses a banjo still today ? Seems sort of racist saying white people didn’t invent any music genres if I’m understanding you correctly I understand African Americans definitely have roots in country and invented hip hop , jazz and blues but how so with rock and roll ?
So from award winning video from years..past to this?
Is there anything that Queen Bey cannot do????
Why is she half naked and she do everything over and over.not for me thanks this video
Does Beyonce' ever think about the little girls watching her videos?  Obviously she does not care that once again, she is promoting "being sexy, being an object," to her young fan base.  Put some clothes on and show some respect for all the country greats that have come before you!   This was "strategically released" the same time as the Grammy's.  Tracy Chapman & "Fast Cars" beats this song hands down in terms of quality and importance.  Granted, a fun dance tune and great to boot-scoot to.   That's it.
Does Beyonce know who the 1981 bull riding champion winner at the Houston Live Stock and Rodeo?
Not sure what to think. Maybe a line dance song that they would play inbetween some real country music?
Is that beginning not Franklin the Turtle beat?!
What a missed opportunity for a fun video. Instead we get to see a scantily dressed star once again. Talented woman, selling out to the music industry again. I love music. Beyoncé is beautiful but this video is so redundant and creatively shallow in my opinion. This is just an opinion before I get crucified on here.
cant even make a music video just looping the same 8 seconds ?
Why she looks so white?? Is she trying to pull a Michael Jackson? She is black so why she is trying to whiten her skin?
How dare she try and expand or experiment with other types of music. What artist in their right mind would ever do such a thing?
Why does she have to be almost naked that’s not what country is about. The song isn’t bad, but her being almost naked is a shame or country
So what is country about this?
Isn't this just Franklin the Turtle Theme Song? For those who know.....lolol
Is it country and can she sing? Yep.  Is it a good song? Nope.
So where is the country song she came out with?
Nice t#*ts. Other than that WTF is this garbage?
This does not sound like a country music song, sorry. Just because you call it a country music song doesn’t make it one. And why does everyone have to be nearly naked these days? We’ve seen it all already and honestly it’s boring at this point. Can ya be a little more creative?
Is the video glitching, or is she doing the same stupid thing over and over again for almost 4 minutes?
I don’t get why she has to dress like that tho. How many other country artists are dressing like that?
I wonder how long she’ll focus on this genre? There are so many layers to explore it could really develop her sound to experiment there are moments in the song where it feels like she’s holding back gotta get into violins
How is this country she's just sitting there half naked she could have done anything better than this crap I'll give it to her at least this song is not half bad
Why is she naked,  porn is hiring.
Why is She always half Naked?😮
What does  her out has to do with  country music   but Lyrics Is wonderful
When you're sittin' at the table
What I find sad is all the people or as they call themselves melanin queens can write a comment only to use "yt" for white/Caucasians but make sure they spell the entire word of black or like i stated previously melanin queens describing themselves. Where is the respect. Even more hilarious is I saw comments saying how country music  was created by the melanin community (the same as braids, light bulbs etc) but yet they've done nothing but denounce it, make jokes on it UNTIL now that Beyonce makes a song considered in the genre of country music now the story can be written to suit their narrative.  I'm not a country music fan but I don't trash talk it, I'm not a fan of Beyonce but i don't trash talk about her. I give her credit as well as those with talent before her. Just be kinder  I already know the comments are coming, I hear computer typing and the negativity raining down on me. But I still have wthe ultimate ounc
Does she have to it naked?
Not country, no band and tits out...wonder why it's #1?
Did not think I'd actually say this but I actually like it?!..
those chords and harmonic shifts at the endddddd..... what is it going into??? what comes next???
Is there a non-jive version available?
What the heck it's that
Why do RnB singers have to ruin everything
This is "country" how?? Is it because you name a song with "Texas" in it that makes it country??
How utterly sad. If she wants to sing a Country song then do so with clothes on, no vulgarity and about genuine, relatable emotions. Uplift. Don't wallow in the endless mire of modern culture. The impressionable young people who listen to this garbage will likely never be exposed to music that is meaningful and sung by adults. May the Dear Lord forgive us.  Acts 2:40. We can and should do better.
Instantly,, right off the bat. Symbolism. Transhumanism, man and machine suggestive programming. Left eye covered.. all stop. I won’t watch any more of this. All piggy backed on a catchy song . Also, this ain’t roots country. It’s superficial pop country. Late! Also, why her tits out?
Why does she has to show her boobs?  She is beautiful but doesn’t have to constantly showing this.  It’s annoying. I want to hear the lyrics not looking at her boobs.
Why is the whole video just a 10 second clip on a loop??
put a shirt on double stick tape can only handle so much. who is stealing whose culture now?
Is she trying to swap with T Swift?
Why is she half naked? Why do women always resort to this?  Is this the whole video or are they just replaying the same part over and over?
Why destroy the country image..smh
Why does she always have to be half naked all the time in her videos. Love the song though.
What kind of a video is this? Am I missing something?
Why cant she perform without showing her skin, eh? Lol
I'm confused as usual. I think I like it?
When you finally beat RED DEAD REDEMPTION.....
Is Country dressing that way these days?  Gees!
Why is there hate for this?
🤣🤣🤣 Did she SERIOUSLY release THAT as a country song???
How is this even classified as country ?
I absolutely love this song, but WTF can we see her boobs?
Is anyone hip to Willie Jones?? Look him up y'all!!
What a ridiculous video. Real talent does have to expose their breast.  Cookie cutter pop.  No talent here.
What absolute garbage of a song.
I like it but what's up with this video????
What is the point in this video.
Why do women keep getting implants lol.  Trust me ladies, most men can tell if they are fake.  It's better to have small natural boobs than to have big artificial silicone boobs.
Why don't people wear clothes anymore.....
Did she go country because Taylor took all the Grammy's? Just asking for a friend😂😂😂😂
Why have to be half naked to sell your music ?  Your talented voice is enough.  Jeez
Cw is black in origin, however where are her clothes?
Why tf is she naked tho?
What the hell!!!!???? Like seriously!? Please NO!!! AND WHAT IS THIS "VIDEO"????
Can someone explain the video and outfit ? Why the outfit (did we really need to see half of the boobs ? Doesn’t line up with the feel of music) and repetition of shooting and blowing out the gun? The creativeness is dull and uninspiring .
Why does there always have to be nudity in music videos?
Cool song.. but what makes it county is my question?
This is Godawful, is she joking?
Sounds like a Gretchen Wilson or Shawna Twain song. Beyonce what are you doing?
Who else loves this song and thinks it's still country?
Why people got to say that she’s claiming black music back??? Firstly music has no colour secondly music is for everyone thirdly no one owns a music genre and please do your history homework as to where music genres originated from…
This is the stupidest fucking thing I've ever heard. I thought her lemonade album couldn't any worse. I mean she literally made Alan Jackson and get up and walk out of the Opry now she wants to try to do country hip hop what's next? Is she going to get into a rap battle with Ryan Upchurch?
What happened to Cultural appropriation? liberals really trying to ruin every single facet of civilization lmao
Why is she doing f the same thing over and over in this video? And that jacket is very, ummmmm, ridiculous? This isn’t country. Sounds slightly gospel to me
Why can’t we have country music like it used to be , that is not how we dress , Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette are rolling over in there graves .. she is fine in pop !! Why country?? Go back to where you belong !!!
When is someone going to call her out for re-using old beats that isn't hers?
Lol why is this considered country? Because there is a guitar?
How about this. She should get dressed go to church and sing to Jesus. Not this stupid world we live in today.....
Why is she half naked, this is trash.
Can something happen other than the same thing over and over and over and over and over? Was she short on funds? Lol
Why do they always have to use sex to sell their music?
What the Frickin  biscuits n gravy is this sh**?  This is not country, let alone her cheap, sleazy video!!  Hollywood has really become desperate to come up with something to " SELL"!  More garbage from the music industry, scraping the bottom of the barrel again.  LOL!!!! Beyonce should just retire.  She wasnt that good before, not its gotten much worse.  Ugh!
What a boring  video . And has nothing to do with western musicians the subject matter of the song. The song is awesome the video NOT.
What about the Gospel genre? OOPS. Nevermind. We KNOW she ain't going there😂
Why is she dressed like a lady of the night? Real country singers don't have to strip nearly naked to sing and sell their songs. Most have good values and morals and are cautious about exposing children to explicit nudity. Was there enough confidence in her that her song was good on it's own, or did it need near nudity to get people's attention?  🤔
Where’s the dance that’s gone viral? Does beyonce not do the dance? Everyone made that dance up to her song????
is this really the official video? great song.. wtf is this video.. playing that same thing over and over...  was the budget 75$ ?
Is this meant to be so boring? Is that a thing now ?
why the baphomet resemblance ?  the hand signs
I take it the song wldnt have been good w more clothes on?
Is this her idea of being rebellious and alternative like the metal hand she had last time? All the goths and metal heads around the world laughed at that
what a great song!!!! terrible video but excellent song, she could done so much with this song
Why doesn't she have a navel on her stomach, yulk 😢😮
When you are Not Hot.  Anymore  You got go with the Flow....
Are you trying to make country look trashy? Because you're succeeding. Come on! This song could have been good if your video wasn't just you standing around half naked shooting finger guns...so trashy! 🙄 plus as everyone has pointed out, you stole this from Franklin.
How is that a #1 song? Pretty much sucks
Where are the rest of her clothes?
Why does she need her tits out to sell music. Great mentoring to girls, not. This is so sad and tragic. Give me Adele, and Jessica Malboy, real talent and realistic role models.
How is this even country? And I don't even like country. I mean dude she messed up the Ave Maria and now this? I mean wtf.
What the hell is this shit, definitely ain’t Country
What a disgrace to country music
Wait am i stuck on repeat?
What message are kids supposed to think looking at her dressed like that and throwing swearing in her beautiful songs 🤦🏽‍♀️ I thought she was God fearing.
When you single handedly end racism.  😂
Why she has to do so much cursing?
Is this fully an AI thing?😂
They call music videos "visualizers" now?
Why she use the intro to the kids' show Franklin tho hahahah
What the what!! What is this?!? How did this become number one on the country charts???
What the hell is this?.... Terrible, Terrible song. She is just trying to remain relevant in this business.
Audition for a strip club in Texas?
what a shit song  culture vulture at work  hypocrisy in full swing.
No music videos for act I and we are on act ii?
This Sucks !! Seroiusly wtf kind video is this ??
Who doesn’t love this song
This song sucks and doesn't sound Country at all how did it become number 1 on the country charts?
Obvi that crap ain't texas. Did she watch like one cowboys and Indians type movie before writing these lyrics/notes??
I like the song, but I'm not a Lesbian. So I don't appreciate looking at a half naked Beyonce repeating the same hand gesture. Couldn't she had took advice from a actual country star for ideas on a video?
What is she trying to say with this video?
anyone wondering  if she has nipples?
What ever happened to the genre I love
This is the “official” video? We not working too hard are we?
Why did she have to dress so raunchy? She can make and set trends. Why? Beyonce, you don't need to this ever😢
Where the fucking video with cowboys and Cowgirls line dancing and Cowboys playing Texas hold’em (card games), where’s the fucking dance people please make it make sense! Where’s the video
This new Country music that y’all hating folks on here listen to isn’t even country music anymore. With that said this song is better than 70% of the new country music. Few country artists are actually writing country music anymore. This is as close to country as Jelly Roll, Kane Brown or FGL have ever been. Tell us why y’all really don’t like the song though?
What some shit music and what a fantastic production on this music video.  What a joke!!!!
what she can't sing if she ain't taken her clothes off?
Who heard titty instead of city when her fingers ran up her cleavage 🤦🏽‍♀️🤣
What a boring video. But I do enjoy the song. Seems she is trying to get on the Taylor Swift bandwagon to get her album of the year...gone back to country music 😆
Why would you just keep doing the same thing over and over? So some guy can spank it to your half naked body?
Why in the world does she have to get naked? It takes away from the song and very disrespectful to her children.
Why are all the white folks so mad? Who are you to say this isn’t country? You don’t even know the roots! That’s like me saying Eminem isn’t hip hop💀💀💀
Did Morgan help with this awesome tune?  https://youtu.be/bGlIGCR8hos?si=2anslSxqHDQn_MkH
Tf she dressed like lady gaga???
I don't understand why it does the same thing?
Is this really country? And is the video seriously just her half naked shooting a fake pistol?
Why is it always with the slutty clothes?  Many of our black queens in the music industry are doing this. Is this really what you need to do to sell records?
uh why does the same scene repeat over & over?
Isn’t this called the so called “Culture Appropriation “?
Is the whole video just an old hag pretending to be a stripper?
No one gonna mention how gross this is towards women?
I wonder since she from Texas and obviously shoots guns if she supports the 2nd amendment or acts like it? She is a Democrat ... Country person huh? Oddly, i dont think the ppl that pay her gonna support it. Umless this is to divide us nore than we already are.
Why doesn't she just go totally nude? She used to have way more class....them days are gone I guess.
Catchy..I guess. I just don’t get why she feels the need to be just about naked. Aren’t we tired of looking at nothing but buns from the leading ladies?
When we've become so full of ourselves we think our titties are enough to carry a whole video for a bland song 😂
No F-words or raunchy sexual lyrics like her other crap?
How is this country?... Cause if the banjo?? 💯💯💯
So it is all about her boobs?
Why does she always have to dress like this ... she has no talent
What is the thing on her eye?
What is happening? I'm a Charley Crockett fan (from Texas) and this video comes up and I'm thinking.. "Beyonce? Hmmm....must be another Beyonce?" Nope. They have good music in Texas. Its not country music...its just music. There's no billboard chart for it. Now...I'm going to look up and old song from Chris Rea (someone reading this may say, "Who?" ) song called...,"Texas ". I love Saturdays.
What an amazing voice, sad tho, it’s amazing what the elites make these puppets do
Isn't this the Franklin theme song??🧐🧐🤔🤔
What the hell is she wearing? Put some clothes on. This does not represent Country music!
Why does it sound like Franklin? Like way more obvious than Blurred Lines sounded like Got to Give it up.  https://youtu.be/injtQDE5GXQ?si=xJYP7yWK0c953eu9
Is this why i seen A Compton Cowboy shirt at Walmart?
What annoying is everyone acts like she the first African-American country singer and she not ..research ..Charlie Pride is my favorite.  You all need stop calling everyone racist because to me hers  sounds like pop not country.  Go search up the great black country singers they sing so much better and i love them .
Why even bother with a music video?
Not country. She needs to listen to Bluegrass and understand it then maybe she’d get what made country music. How did this make any chart??
97.5 corpus christi won't play this. Right?
I just forwarded video and Im dissapointed now. Whats with this video? Its just boring, I couldnt listen to the whole song coz the video was just boring. Why would anyone do this???
Great song but why the outfit?
When you order a country song from Wish .
Not a country fan at all. Question…do country videos usually have boobs hanging out in them?
Anybody else only hear "The Gambler" when the music starts?
WTH is the matter with her?
Can we get some 2A support here miss Bey?!
P.S. What's with the black pseudo "country" genre? Get bored, didnt know what other avenue to take? Madonna had a dabble in it too, with her "white" cowgirl phase. Is that a symbolic MK Ultra program - an - I'm so tough image? The majority of  people dont like country music, so what's the purpose of all this? Self sabotage?
Why didn't she dance I sure was waiting But i gather she didnt have enough clothes on😢
Why Beyonce stealing Franklin's theme song. She's definitely hotter than Franklin though. She is Smokin!!!!
Am I the only one who thinks this is terrible?
Big Bet fan but nobody did country like K. Michelle bc she actually grew up in Nashville so it’s in her blood. This just looks like something else to do for Bey. Country music is so about heartbreak and break ups. Is this a hint?
Is this a mocking parody?  I seem to recall this thing called cultural appropriation.  If this ain't it, then nothing is.
What’s and the Lil Wayne rap rock is this  bulls***??
What kinda  video is this what a waste of film 🙄
How dare a demon sings a song to texas
Why would this be a good song to line dance to!?🤠
Why do them folks have to make everything about race? It’s a nice country song. Black people have been making country music for many many years.  Indeed, the word ‘cowboy’ was initially reserved as a racist term for black men. The white men were called cowhands.
When you run out of ideas for pop songs so you jump to country!!
Doesn’t she have a stylist or someone to tell her to put some clothes on?
What happened to the days when female pop/soul/country stars didn't have to dress like hookers to sell records? She's about as country as Xaviera Hollander.
Why did I stumble on this trash. She sucked before. More so now. Jesus what has this world came to. 😂
Where is the country song 🤔 i didn't hear it.
Why is she wearing nothing ??ridiculous
What makes this country? The only thing country is the banjo in the background at times.😄
This is unlike any country music video I have ever seen.  Where are her clothes?
Why is she dress that way
If she's such a great singer,  why must she depend on coming out naked to get attention for her "talent"?
What a stupid video clip and the song is just stupid
I like the song but, can she put some clothes on and, be a little more modest.  Since when does country do porn?
What an insult to even call this country. This is straight crap.
Did she copy Franklin the turtle theme song?
Oh geeze, just no. And the video is just as ridiculous. Why is it number 1 anywhere?
I dont know,  but there's something about looking like a stripper and country music that dont mix. And "bitch"???
what the whole fck is this? ROFL. This video is trash asf. Where is Bey? They cloned her, huh?  She can't break the internet like she used to.
what a disgrace to country music
Did I miss a video?  Or is it really the exact same move over and over and over again?
who told her this was the route to take. yikes
Is she just doing this to make a big impact and be talked about?
Isn't this the Franklin song just with different words?
What cowboy pulls up in a Lexus? 🤷
why. don't. I. like. this. i like country but this just generic maybe?
She is somebody's mother. Does she still need that in 2024 ?
Just hecause she sings about Texas doesn't make this a country song, sorry, was this done because Tracy Champman appeared on the country charts with the rerelease of Fast Car?
How sad she has to show them ta ta's. Unnecessary and bad influence for kids Really not a great song but I guess she needs the cash.
What is she (not) wearing? She has the greatest voice, why'd you have to go cheap??!
What the hell is this she isn’t country what a disgrace
When was this written? When did it come out? I’ve heard this before this isn’t new.
what an embarassment to actual country music. Nothing about this song represents country music.
What a joke complete lack of real country talent
That's the best video/choreography they could come up with for this video?
Why foul language? That's not country bringing the hood into country music, Can't we keep anything clean?
I can’t even get through the song because of how trashy this video is. Does she know country artists generally wear clothes?
How could she forget her shirt?
Will there  be a music video?
What is the point of looping the same video? Is there an artistic message I’m missing? Honestly love B but this felt like a porn gif on repeat
I wonder which County musician she stole this song from?
What's with the plastic wrap on her eye? Why do we have to see her cleavage?
What does she even talking about in the song is she talking about all the black on black crime and blame it on the white people and how white people take Grammys from her. Blaming everybody
Could she have any more clothes on?!?! 😂
Why is this video 8 hours long
so....white people can wear Dredds now??????
Erotica comes to country …. Is nothing precious?
What the heck, why are you half naked singing a country song?? Shameful!! Be aware in case you are not , kids are watching this video too. What’s the purpose, I am appalled.
Why is she almost completely naked? There is no need for it…
When the  sensual goes vulgar. Sad😢
So if she posts a video naked then it's suddenly ok Youtube?
When did we go from Halo to curse words half of a song 😢
how tf is this country? it’s fckn trash
And why does she have to be half naked?
Why is she almost naked. Girl put some clothes on
Why is it all the same?
What a stupid video. Let’s just walk around half naked and pretend shoot in the dark. Song is ok, I’m mostly underwhelmed
What the heck is a "Visualizer"? And that outfit is ridiculous.
Is this video a joke? Is the song a joke?!? What in the name of boring is this a loop of the same shot?
How dare she desecrate country music!! Abomination!!
I love QB but it’s the same 7 seconds on replay. So many things she could have done with this but this was a call it in - sick day. Fierce outfit   Hair on point. Video content. 7 s. TikTok. I’m dialing in a negative. Maybe contact a producer/conductor with decades of cred.  Ummmm TS?
Where are Beyonce's clothes?????????????/ This is disgusting
Video is 👎👎..trashy.. one eyed stuff.. illuminati??
this song is garbage. who would think this is a good country song?
Can people please stop pretending that black people created country music? country music comes from FOLK music, which existed way before the US was even founded. Folk music comes from the German word "volk". Country music, jazz, rock, bluegrass, psychobilly, rockabilly; all these genres stem from FOLK music. SOME of those genres (country, jazz, blues) are products of black AND white people collaborating, creating beautiful things TOGETHER, yet the foundations of country come from folk music, created by white people. To overlook the contributions of either demographic to those genres is unfair.  Plus, the foundations of musical theory were laid way before the US was founded. Not one instrument used to play jazz, country, bluegrass, rock, or country was created by black people, all those instruments were created by Germans, Spaniards, and Italians. FACT. There are black cowboys and cowgirls, but Beyonce isn't one of them.  Not everybody from Houston is a cowgirl or a fan of country. If her country music was good tho, that would be one thing. But why does she feel it's necessary to morph into a white woman to release a country album. Her skin is way lighter than ever before (like Oprah, lil Kim, Nicki Minaj), she lives in straight blonde wigs.  It's def giving appropriation, and that Texas hold em song is straight up trash 😆🗑️ "Ultimately, country music's roots lie in the ballads, folk songs, and popular songs of the English, Scots, and Irish settlers of the Appalachians and other parts of the South." " In essence, country is one part of folk. It is a unique style of folk music. Folk music—even in its second wave—didn't stray from its pure form." "Country music has a rich and diverse history that spans over a century, evolving from the traditional folk music of the Southern United States". "Country Music emerged as British Isles settlers moved into the Appalachians. A fusion of English fiddle music, Scots-Irish dance music & American blues."  It's extremely disrespectful (and borderline racist) to overlook and exclude the contributions white people made to  the foundations of musical theory in general and folk, country, rock, blues, etc.
How old is her kids now? Is it necessary?
Is it just me or is the whole video basically on repeat and shes doing the same thing on repeat? I mean hey, takes a master musician to put that together right. Hard pass, garbage.
sorry im trying to understand how this is a country song ?
Does she need to dress like this? 👎🏾
A mother of 3 child? No ! Where is the respect ?
What the fuck is this trash 😂😂😂
What trash, I guess it's all about her boobs.
This sounds like a parody of country music. Is Beyonce mocking country?
Cultral appropreation? Why is Beyonce taking the whyte peoples culture? is she trying to be whyte?
What a mega talent,she jus cant help it!!
What a ridiculous outfit!!!   Come on Beyoncé are you so insecure you have to be half naked to get attention from the men.   Put some he and and a nice plain top on.
The heck is she wearing? Why does every genre of music need to be hoe-ified?
Did she sample this song from Franklin theme song?
What a horrible song I can't even get past the first couple of lines.
Why she tryna look like Latto lately 😂
Is this supposed to be a music video?!
Could you imagine if she used her gift to give glory to GOD 🙏
Song is catchy.  Is an "official visualizer" what you call a  clip put on a loop?
Why does she need to be basically naked
When did Beyonce become  a white women
WHAT THE F--- IS THE POINT OF REPEATING THIS HALF NUDE SCENE OVER AND OVER?? BOOOOORING!!!!
Where are her clothes? I'm trying to raise my daughter to be classy, not trashy, no thanks.
My ears just threw up and my eyes are bleeding. Is that supposed to happen?
What a bust  This ain’t it, I hope 16 carriages is better lmfao!!!
Why didn't she just do vid- naked!?😢
What a great country song.....NOTTTTTT !!!!! Nowhere near country. Put some clothes on....
I wonder if country music is gonna get a revival. I love "The Gambler" by Kenny Rogers and also the entire "O Brother Where Art Thou" movie soundtrack.  As one not too fond of current pop music or its artists, this surprised me. Good for Beyonce
What can I do to make myself relevant!? 🤔  I know💡 I'll do a country music song 😮
What a masterpiece song queen of the music 🤗🤠😍
Was that a nip slip I saw? Geez, what's with all the boobs hanging out?
Used to be a huge fan but she took the piss out of Taylor swift and now she's blonde and doing country music...... hmm 😒 copying much?
Why in the world and to take this long U 2 a Country Song 🎶 maybe bBeyoncé will bring back line dancing ❤ . I have a nice clogging dancing beat to it . I bet it sounds like 150 beats good workout . Go Beyoncé . ❤
I like the song but why is the video so hoe-ish?
Is there some kind of hidden message in this video?  How many times its repeat this loop? What seconds she fire?
Idolatry will land you all in hell. Stop glorifying regular human beings like you and I. Singers are good at singing just like builders are good at building God gave us all talents but you dont see people glorifying the architects that built your homes or the people that designed your cars even though those abilities are far more impressive than singing. We've lost touch with what's truly important in life. Thanks to the Idolatry, we are teaching our youths, the next generation only want to be youtubers or actors instead of engineers and builders. Nothing is to be worshipped other than Jesus. We throw millions of dollars to singers, actors, athletes and pay, builders, masons, roofers, a mediocre pay but have you asked yourself which one is more important and which one we can live without?
Why are people acting like this is Beyonce first rodeo 😂 she has done country music before
Why she got to be half naked
Did SHE wrote the song? Doubt it
I guess this is an ok line dancing song but, is it really country? I mean she not runnin from da law, her man (likely her brother/cousin/uncle) aint dun left her, and all her animules is still livin, so...???
This is hilarious 😂 and why she half naked with a “finger gun”?
What a mockery of country music 😅 she should stick to what she knows. We’d respect her more.
She's still bitter that Taylor Swift came from country to Beyonces backyard and stole all her spotlight. So she thinks she's rich enough to pull the uno reverse card and do the same thing.   But how about trying to stick to the sound of the genre for once? You can't just change evert fundamental thing about a specific genre and just say that's what it is cause you got some words in there like hoedown..   If a country song says bitches and Hos does that suddenly make jt an rap song?
Is this the song video??? Can't be. Why so low budget?
Why does she feel she needed to be half naked? To promote it? Being well dressed is not out of style.
When u hate country music but Bey makes it 🔥
In what alternate dimension is this considered country?
Why everyone hating ? I enjoyed it pretty well.
So if she didn't come out selling her body to America would anyone really like this song? Is this music or PLayboy?
Absolutely the dumbest song. What the heck is she thinking?
who's here from YouBetcha Radio?
what a load of sh*t
Why was there a need to call someone a b!@#$ and cuss in this song? It is so sad that Beyonce decided to taint this song with that language and then dress this way. Her music can't even be played with children listening. This carnal society where any and everything is acceptable will ultimately experience the consequences sooner than later.😢
Everyone excited to see some transsexual show some cleavage?
They said whore down. Did she fall?
Why do it just keep repeating the same shot? She could have done so much more for this music video!
What a crappy video to an otherwise good song...
I’m just glad she is pro finger gun.  But she needs some clothes on.  What is wrong with people?
Must sex always be in the mix and for sale by modern female music artist?  What happened to the Whitney Houstons or the Sades?
Why does she or anyone think that's COUNTRY music.
They couldn't come up with any more ideas on the video?
the entire video is the artist all glammed up with lots of skin showing?  is that country now?
Is this the ORIGINAL  video?? Because if so, Beyonce has a bloated sense of self!¡!¡  Song was GREAT!! She looks STUNNING!!!! She isnt trying to infiltrate country music . The lady IS SOUTHERN!! She has always had a clear accent or drawl.  I look forward to hearing more.
Why is she dressed like a street walker, as usual?
Why does she have to wear such provocative suit?😮
Who else can hear the gunshots? 😮
What makes this a country song and not a pop song
Why do these pop "stars" always have to be so trashy? I guess music isn't enough. You have to show tits to grab people's attention.
Is that a patch on her eye, why?
Meh, and what's with the boring looping video ?
What a surprise! I actually love her singing Country.
Why wear the jacket … she shouldn’t have worn pants either and showed the world her beaver 😂😂😂😂 What a stupid video 😂😂
What is the purpose of this video......................great song
What the fuck is this and is this video 😂😂😂😂😂😂
How is this country music? It is just another Pop song with a country twist by the great Beyonce but nothing else.
Why isn't this on my TL every day I literally have to search it. I'm a die hard Bey fan this should automatically pop up
What country would sound like of black people would have owned white people as slaves
How can you be so rich and not put out a good song? Especially when you have multiple writers, and family members who might have told you that this was beyond awful. It was painfully bad.
Is this a joke? Beyoncé from the video to the song you coulda done way better I feel like the video is on repeat of u walking and your finger shooting🤣. I’m sorry but it’s horrible.
Where was all the outrage a few weeks ago when Luke Combs hit #1 on the country charts singing a Tracy Chapman song and sounding almost exactly the same as the original.  I don't remember everyone running around saying this isn't country.
Why not sign county music when the banjo was brought  to America by enslaved Africans. ❤❤❤❤
What in the fk is this😂
If you think this music video is good you must be on crack. The same 15 second clip played over and over and they make millions off this? 😂 what in the actual fuck?
So does Beyoncé have Afro hair under those wigs?
Is this really what all the fuss is about, really?
What is she wearing? Love the song hate the outfit doesn't quite go with the song?
How do we get this to go number one on billboard
Why does America or wherever call biracial people black ?if they have white blood also in their veins , its so rediculous , rather not say anything, if you so concerned about racial matters ,z why uplift one part and not the other part? all people by now come from mixed races,  my son has a lovely woman she is   a dark lady a beautiful person and if she has a child , i would want the child to he proud of  my side as well
How can you guys not admit that this song is atrociously bad? It's okay if you like beyonce, but this is not a good song LOL
Is this a joke? 😂😂😂😂 what is this video?😂😂😂😂 Queen B. Thank you for this laugh.  The tune is catchy.
This vid should be published only on Onlyfriends. When did it become normal to be 1 inch from being topless for 4 minutes?
Of course she's not capable of bringing anything to the table without being barely dressed. Doesn't matter if it's a good song if she is just going to bring the same smutty, sexualization visuals with it. Desperate for that album of the year Bee?
Am I the only one hoping to see some nipple action?
Can you become North’s teacher? I don’t want North to become like Cardi B
Yall who are saying you are now country fans , uhhhh no your not, your a Beyonce fan and you like this song and this song is no where near close to country music.  Juuuust keeping it uhhh 🤔 ohhhh 💯,  ðid I do that right?
Why does she have to be half naked just to sing.  Then Taylor Swift just has too shakes it
What a joke this song is awful.  Her worst song
And what exactly is this called? And what the hell is she singing about?
How is this song good? Yall tripping this song sucks.
Why she dressed like a space hooker?? I'm a musician. THIS AIN'T COUNTRY. It's missing authentic country soul. Sounds like it was produced with computers. NOPE, sorry, it's missing that country heart and soul. Like I said. You can hear it's made with computers
Who's listening to this in 2024!?!   No seriously. Who the fuck is listening to this trash?
This ain't texas, but you can hold em?
How does this trash make it to #1? Fuckin hick-hop, tractor rap bullshit.
Why can’t she come up with a good dance song?
Is this what we call a music video in 2024?! I miss MTV and VH1. Take me back….
Do women always have to be half naked?
Awful song 😂😂 what's with the background singers?
Is this white cultural appropriation ?????? Jk lol good song
Is this a joke? Made number 1 on Top 20??? It sucks!!!
What a absolute crock of turds 😂😂😂
How embarrassing  to even think this is country music...have some self respect to use profanity in country music ...not a fan
Why do you liberals feel the need to ruin everything. You tanked hip hop and RnB with your nonsense already, let country be. I doubt miss billionaire has any similarities to the common folk.
What's a half naked women have to do with country music?
Did they just film one scene and then put it on repeat?
Does she know what country is? Her outfit would say... no. Her song sounds like everything else she does with a twangy background.
What possessed Beyonce to sing country. Not winning enough awards being herself or what? SMH. It is decent tho.
Why she have to use sexual ho strut & vulgar language to make a country song?
How many takes did she do??? Nip slip country 😅
Why does she have to be almost naked? Isn't the song good enough on its own?
Good thing she has that body, but she is just being a skank singing country.  Don't we have enough of those already?
Is this actually good, or am I just tripping? Obviously it's not authentic country, but when was the last time that even existed?
Is this like a new movement? Bleached skin and blonde hair? Real question.
What an insult to real country music.
What a damn boring video ... song is ok .. good swap to your usual rubbish past few years Beyonce
Sooo LOVE the song. Love BEyoncé....LOATH the video....she looks great but WHY do we need that much flesh?
What happened to creativity? That’s all they could come up with for a video for this song?
Who said this is country?  It absolutely is not.  Catchy but not country music.
could you be any lazier in making a video???
Why does she have to be naked to sing⁉️⁉️
What does this video have to do with Country... And The first words... THIS ISN'T TEXAS...But she's from TEXAS...The Bitch Word Isn't Part of Country Music 🎵 🎶...Dive Bars...😮😅😂😂😂
are any taylor swifts using the snake on her sunglasses as a theory they have a duet coming?!
First of all…this is not country music. Secondly, it’s terrible irregardless of any genre.  I had to come here to hear this song. I’ve not heard it on ANY country stations I’ve listened to.  How does a song that is trash and doesn’t get played on country stations shoot to one on Country Billboard Charts?
I like the song. But do we really need to see her breasts?
Why is this video so low effort though?
What happened to her clothes....yikes
Is this a joke?!? 😂😂😂 she’s really reaching for her Grammy!! LMAOOO   Is that her country moves? Pow pow…🤣🤣
Are you effin' kidding me? Sooooooo NOT country.  Have you ever heard a REAL country song or is this just your impression of what you think about country folks. Just stay in your lane.  You seem to have a decent grasp of what is happening in your genre. You are dangling on the edge with Bud Light by making fun of country people. FAFO
Love beyonce, the song is amazifn as well but this doesnt sound like country im confused ?
What a stupid video and song! OMG
The song is great but the video is terrible! It is low budget and same clip over and over. Beyoncé is so talented. Why did she allow this awful video??
Is that the actual video? There's nothing to it. The lyrics seem to be stuck on repeat. Not much to them either. I expected a lot better.
Is this the actual video? I like the song but this video is weird
What can be more worse than a Beyoncé song? A Beyoncé country song
This is country? Why because it has a banjo?
So is it the music that makes it country or the voice?
What did country ever do to you? Please for the love of everything 🛑
Who's the genius that came up with this music video on a loop?
What an embarrassment to country music. CHAPEL HART is more talented than Beyonce.
This is more country than most modern country! Is the rest of the album similar?
What's with her appropriating long blonde hair?????
What a disgrace for what she is wearing that is a slap in face for country music you do not need dress as such but country singers class you do not the song sounds pop show some class would you if you want other country singers to take you serious then dress right
Cover up girl! U r a role model for your daughters! Is that what u want blue to b seeing???
Isn't it that the Democrats are trying to get the Texan in their pocket?
Glorify gun use like the US isn't in crisis?
What in the illuminatti is this?!?  Is this SNL?
Wtf is with the video . On a loop ?
Wtf lol 😆 can't beat em join em aye?
Does she wants to be white? What is with country music, it all sounds the same, same semi naked body, and same rhythm…🫣🫣😷
People upset over her doing a "country" album, have you not noticed Nashville turning country music into pop music over the last thirty years?
Who knew all it took was Beyonce to bridge the gap between hip/hop and country.
Is she on drugs…are we not trying anymore?
WHY DOES SHE KEEP DOING THE SAME THING ON THE VIDEO..NOT VERY CREATIVE EXCEPT THE GUYS WILL LIKE HER CHEST..
why its hate or somebody's mad cause they don't like the song?. some of you and your fandom is weird af.. I like the other song better and i will support this sister making a country album because we as a people are talented enough to be number in any genre of music.. But going at people over their opinion is crazyy
What a stupid music video it's the same thing over and over again... This is not country...
So if this is country does that make michael jackson the king of country?
Couldn't they do something more for the video tho?
How can any1 be falling for this. This aint country music. And all the sudden this chick loves country music? Cmon country fans. Dont let people like this infect the genre.
So who wrote this song for her?
Why is a black making country music. This is trash
Where Taylor is running away from country, Queen B sprinting towards country music.
Is this actually the official video? Love, love the song, but this is the most boring video ever. I was waiting for it to start and it never did….
Is it a good country song? It's too pop for my liking.
The song is good but this is an awful video? Borg goes country? Movements on repeat?
What makes it country the yeah!  Or the wooh! ? Asking for a friend
Nice song,  would it kill her to put some clothes on?
what is this  where is the country in this and why the monotonous video??
Yo what made you do this my neega???
Why does she have to be half naked singing a country song?
What's with black people and nudity?
What the actual #@#@ is this. I sure hope country radio don't play this. What would Jones and Haggard say. 😮
Who said shes the first black woman comes first in country music? Shes not black. U can’t even see any black on her.
Is there anything Bey can’t do??
Why doesn't she make an actual video
The mix seems really flat and quiet. Can't tell if that's a YT thing or if the song is just kinda flat on its own. Anyone else know?
What on freaking earth is this 😢 and the video is even worse! Put some clothes on women,have a little dignity this isn’t what the Country Genre is about....at all!!!!
What the hell is this dog shit?
The music is catchy but I really don't want to see this continuous loop of B trying to look sexy. It got old after the second time around. How about some real country dancing?
Can someone fill me in on the WHY to this...why did we need this? What's up with Beyonce?
Where is the country inspiration in this song? This ain’t no Hank Williams.
Feels like R an B not so much country  ??
This is the best video they could come up with?
What a joke. Its a pop song, with few country phrases and some cussing.
What the heck is she wearing? She mind as well  get naked.
Why you gotta do the baphomet hand gesture 😞
Doesn't this fall under culture appropriation? She's literally singing about things she knows nothing about. Stay in your lane
Why are y’all so pressed in the comments????? THIS IS NEW AGE COUNTRY THE BEYONCÉ WAY!!!!! Keep watching lol…..
She stole that beat from Franklin the turtle. Unoriginal horrible song with broken ass lyrics. And when did country songs have Lexus’s in them????
Is this what people think country is ?
When she gonna put some clothes on?  She has 3 kids.
How did she memorize that choreography?
Ummm NO!! She ain’t ever stepped on dirt let alone had it on her hands…. This ain’t Texas ain’t no hold em???? What does that even mean.  She’s just saying words.  Did she have a stroke?
Why the video when it’s the same thing in repeat.  🙄
So country is basically soft porn now?
I wonder who really wrote this song? Since it’s common knowledge she steals credit, and uses her power to force the real writers into signing NDA’s.
😂 this is terrible. Was the song written in like ten minutes?
Wait, she just repeats the same soft-porn video snippet again and again?
Love it ,Beyonce is there anything you can't sing?
What sort of a video clip is this?
What a disgrace...🙄...so now she is trying to be the ppl she hates on...ok!👍👎🤣
How has this been out for over a week and I haven’t heard a thing about this? Blasphemy ! It’s so good! I hope she gets the Chicks to sing this with her at some point!
Why is it necessary to show tits bouncing under hot set lights, gross. Can't the song and the talent be enough?
Are real cowgirls dressed like this? 🤔
How can you like this and not be a fan of country. It’s always the celebrity dick riders, the type who care more about the name attached to it rather than the quality and talent of the performer. Thank You Beyonce for a song that doesn’t sound like shit, could’ve done with something more country than the commercial esc whistle solo. Harmonica would’ve been hilarious and amazing at the same time.
Why aren't there any good musicvideos??
Alexis Jones will you be my wife???
How classy. Put some clothes on.
Is it just me or is this video a lot of nothing?   Doesn't seem to go with the song.
Is this the official music viddy? Cause I’m confused after the 6th loop lol 😅
When has Beyonce and Jay-Z been to the dive bar?? 😭
Is it fear that Beyoncé will do country music better than those country 'singers' doing it for years the reason for all this outrage? 😂😂😂 Do ya thang girl! Racists are too ridiculous...
How do they find that banjo sound on the beat machine
Why do I like Beyoncé's  country music more than her other music? Lol I'm with this. 😊
Why does it sound like it was recorded 20yrs ago though? Lol or under water. Sound quality is fuckin awful! 😂😂😂
Ok so am I the only one that want to learn how to line dance to this??
What are you all on because you need to share this is trash wtf even is this do you genuinely like this or is it because its Beyoncé like what the hell😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why is the.video so bland for such a fun song
Why does she have to dress like that. So inappropriate 😔
Wow. This sucks. How much for 5 min bey?
Why is she making country music slutty?
At 1:39, I had to stop. Even by the shitty standards of  current country music, this is not it. You'll never catch me drinking whiskey and fucking around while listening to this. It is a song, but it is not good nor country. Also, what is up with the lame video?
Who cares if it is country or not! At least it isn’t boring like most country songs are 😂😂😂
What does dressing like a whore have to do with country music ?
Why always fkn  half naked? Cant she sell with talent??  And we all know they get lipos every other week!
How can yall even put this a country music conversation
What the actual hell is this video?!!  🤮  Does no one realize why it’s so repetitive in her motions, over and over - with one of her eyes covered?!   It does NOT get more demonic than music that comes with a pretty face.
This is the video? The same thing over and over??
All the amazing music this fabulous lady has made and we get this?  Didn’t Madonna do country way back in the 90s then Gaga try to have a go and flopped ? Why Beyoncé? Music needs a real injection of excitement , someone to reset and raise the bar, remind us there’s still great music to be made.but this? So bland . I expected much more from such a superstar. And such an awful cheap cover photo. Is this the image you’re putting out there for yours and our daughters to be like?
What a joke! She's a 🤡
Does she have to be naked for everything???? Good grief!!!
Is the Destiny's Child on back up vocals?  Oh thats right, she left them.. i love country singers, like Reba, loretta, Dolly, not this Shit!  No heart in it. It sucks.  Catchy tunes good
What is this utter utter garbage 🗑 😂😂😂
What a great mom and Christian ✝️
Wait a minute...this ain't the video! Is she not gonna do videos any more?
Why don't you learn something from your sister it's called individuality and learn to be your self. Stop copying other people you could never be chapel heart you could never be a cowgirl, you're a privilege stinky billionaires that nobody really cares to hear from anymore, why don't you go serve the poor go feed the homeless go do something with yourself and get out of our face! You're not Solange!
Is this the only video to this?
How many underage girls have given birth to Jay-Z's children?
Was the open bust necessary for that kind of music?
K Michelle went country first though and no one is giving her credit… smh  All about the culture but only when it’s B?
Why is the video so boring tho
Cmon wtf she wearing? Can she do anything without looking trashy? Anything at all???
What's up with them fake ass ta tas spread tooo far apart?
wow, sex...what kind of an outfit is that??
why she calling tha bros a 'bitch' tho?? 😭 chill
Why does everything have to have sex and nudity in it? Is there nothing else in the world?
Who came here just to boost Beyoncé over Kanye and then stayed for the great song 🙋‍♀️
What kinda video is this? Why is her 🐈 on repeat???????????
When one can't sing anymore, one becomes naked to distract one's voice to the sexual desires. .
What a load of nonsense. This is not country, lyrics are so bad. Song is just bad and now suddenly everyone likes country try. This ridiculous world of viral garbage is ridiculous and she looks pathetic in the video. Like dude grow up
How is this not top 10?
Nice song. Why is she practically naked in the visual? How does that do anything but provoke sexual thoughts?
his video is promoting a perception of gun violence.  I don't thin CW music videos shows so much nudity.  Young girls will watch this and think that is what women has to do to get attention!  She has set all women back years and years.  Why can't we earn respect without making everything so indecent and slutty???
Why is her skin white, has she been beaching it
She looks like an android, not any were near country?
Why does she have to be half naked. Song is great... but.  WOW
Where can I get a shirt like that
What a icky video. Great song, but why on earth would she do this?
does she have the disease Michael Jackson had?
Country style R&B, but not exactly traditional country music--and I guess that's ok. If traditional country music audiences snub it, so what?
Why can't Obama go close to them ?
What I will do to you for bringing a Nigerian with a Roca fella jacket to Europe , you can not imagine
They should cool it off, am giving everything what do you want?
I am at a lost.  Is there a message to the world?  I guess she is gearing up to raise money  to become a nominee for the billionaire club.  You can not take it with you.  People will wonder how did Beyonce impact the world?
Why does she need to dress so nasty. Just think of all the young women that are looking up to her.
what a stupid video,  and a shitty song  👎👎
Not a fan of her’s but I like this song. I’m just not sure why it’s the same image over & over?
in what world is this classified as country music?
Why does she have to be half naked? Come on its 2024 talent does not require getting your kit off anymore.
Country music Very good, but... where's the coreografy????
When she said "hoedown" i was like "Ohh, who she call a Hoe?" 😮
Did she just do 1 song or a whole album?
1:51 Anybody else hear the Doug theme song in their head?
When did she get a boob job?
What a masterpiece song stream on Spotify for global chart #1 now on place 3
Does anyone understand what this video means? Why is it just a repeating loop of her walking, touching her abdomen and pretending to shoot with her left hand? What does a silver snake on the left eye mean? I really like this song but the video is strange.
okay so were now trying to F#k our way to a grammy?
Just because she said Texas makes it country??
Why does she need to come out half naked?? She already sells alot of albums. Its not like she needs to show it all. I have never seen Beyonce like this. She was so  classy but I guess not anymore
Who produced that video? It's rough for an A level star.
Does being from Texas make you country?
Can anyone say CULTURAL APPROPRIATION!!??? I guess this is ok though right?
Call me old fashioned but wtf's up with the outfit...or lack thereof!?
How many times..... will caucasian people STEAL from other cultures. Than get "angry" when it's reclaimed & ACT like they own it. Honestly. It's pathetic & disgusting. But all love to everyone, all the same.
What the hell did I listen to John Schneider the right about what he said about her
Who cares.. no one owns the music genres.. why is everyone so upset.  Every artist can put out their music and if it sells it sells.. all this hate of whether it is country or gospel or whatever is just hate.. She doing her thing her fans will dig it and everyone that doesn't like her music wont.. Just let her do her thing and enjoy that all kinds of artists can do all types of music.. QUIT WITH EVERYTHING HAVING TO BE IN THE POLITICAL REALM AND DIVIDING PEOPLE.  THIS ALBUM IS NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER. BEYONCE IS MAKING MUSIC. IF YOU LIKE IT LISTEN. IF YOU DON'T THEN DONT LISTEN.. PEOPLE ALL FULL OF HATE INSTEAD OF JUST ALLOWING PEOPLE TO DO THEIR THING..
her fit screams rock here, or am i trippin???
If she's so talented, why does she have to rely on an up-close shot of her breasts every 8 seconds???
Why cant she find something else to do in her spare time.. She has enough money
How is this a good song? Her voice is good but she says nothing. Why does she have to be damn near naked to do this video if you can call it a video? Did we all see and hear the same video? I initially thought I was being punked  but it’s real? Wow
Soo, Biden-Beyonce laser eyes… did she said:”F U Texas.” ?
I love you Beyonce but CAN YOU DO AN ACTUAL VIDEO PLEASE???
When did she get implants, I guess JZ was stepping out or looking to, lol. How pathetic to be this vain and shallow, she’s got a career, money, fame, power, and a family, but all of that wasn’t enough, she needed something more, it’s never enough, pathetic, she should write that as her next crappy country song, lol
WHY DURING "BLACK HISTORY" MONTH IS SHE TURNING COUNTRY LOOKING BLEACHED AND TRYING TO BE EUROPEAN....WTFC IS GOING ON? YALL WILL BUY ALL THEY BULLSH!T💯‼️   THIS IS NOT BLACK MUSIC...TF
What kind of video is this supposed to be? Lots of repetition. It's almost like it's supposed to hypnotize you.
so women can't wear pants these days and cant even wear tops?
What the in the ai generated video shit was that
And she had to expose major boobs becauae?
Is that all she does the whole video?
Will they play it in a hip hop club? Or will we have to go to a country bar to hear it? I think because she's done so much for OUR community, any club should play it. Let us have fun and line dance in the middle of a hip hop club! We deserve that!
Why does she not have a shirt on  I’m traumatized 😭😭😭
Did you see the unprecedented country to house piano transition???? My niggguh 😭😭😭😭😭 the blend n mashup n mix of all field of black music and it still sounds fresh n nostalgic at the same time.... Your fav could NEVA it's Queen Bey bishhhhhhh
How she’s dressed in this video country music won’t go for that especially not the good ole boys of country music. But I actually like the song
Where in the hell are your clothes? Smdh 🙄
This ain’t country. At all. And what’s with the playboy , soft porn wannabe thing?
When I heard the song I really liked it without her sexin everybody up with the visuals  she doesn't need to it's a fun song
Can someone tell me who's taken music history and has an understanding of music why this sounds kinda like pop to me it sounds like pop country like Taylor swift
Anyone else hear Kelly on vocals?
Why is nothing she shows reflecting any of her words? She's looking like a 304, but she pretends to have values
Who is this white lady and why is her music so bad ?
Stupid song has no point stupid video over and over same thing? Beyonce trying to rule country music now? LMAO 😂😂😂WTF???
Why does Beyonce feel the need to show her private parts to get attention? Doesn't she think her music is good enough? #insecurities
Can someone hurry up and come up with the Texas Hold ‘Em Challenge dance so I can binge watch while I listen to this song?!
Really love the music but the clip is a real BS. Why are you neaked ?
why would u just not stay in yo lane babe
It's a great song, but is the outfit really necessary?
What a crap amateur song. Her fan base is so blind that everything she puts out is a hit. But in Nashville, this amateur piece of crap would never be released. Listen to her sing in a low key that sounds like she's struggling. Ppl nowadays really are pathetic if they think this is country.
Why did she feel like she had to perform a Kim k photo shoot. I’ve seen way better dances and line dances on tik tok. She needs to collaborate all those amazing artists and re launch this video.  Great song
I wasn’t paying attention was she singing something??
Why is she naked.  ENOUGH of the nudity from performers.  I Don't like the song and the video sucks
I wonder how this album will go over.  It's so different from her usual, IMO.
Why is she showing her breast like that
I am a metal head. Never liked country and didn't care much for Beyoncé's music, BUT WHY DO I REALLY LOVE THIS?
What in the actual f#ck 🫥
Why does this make her more 🔥
Does anyone else hear Kelly in the background?
Am I missing something?  Is she ever going to make a video anymore?
I didn't know she had a boob job? what else is fake?
She has evolved for real, now where is my Whiskey?
Who ever is reading this right now I just shat my self
Why the video on repeat in the beginning? Can’t show more data to the masses? Why are you hiding now? *snicker* Anyway, nice bod. Can’t wait till I get it back. Try not to torture me tonight. - Glad I was able to sing one line in there. Love to the rest of y’all from Texas, ain’t no Hollywood money running through these bones
how many times does have to do the same thing crap song
Why her video is on repeat?
Why Beyonce don't wear clothes anymore.
I don't get it, if she is supposed to be such a great singer, why is she always half naked in her videos?
When you get too big for your britches
What a stupid, non talented video.
What the fxxk is this shit???
Hey look, another pop star like Taylor Swift who thinks she's "country"?
Why is she naked in both videos pretty much?
What she tryna say by this ain’t Texas?
Is it her on the oops?! 👀
What the hell did I just listen to? It’s awful Beyoncé needs to stick with her pop music.
What the hell is the garbage 😩😩
What I love about Taylor Swift is she doesn’t need to use sex or her body to sell her music. I guess that’s rare these days.
Anyone noticed that this video starts playing from the 22nd second when you press play.? What a trick to increase views knowing views count from the 15th second. Isn’t this cheating ?
Did my video have a glitch? It was the same thing over and over for the whole thing 🤷🏼‍♀️
How about you stay in your own lane and make pop music and stay away from Country because I’m gonna get this song banned
When is she going to put clothes on?
She sing really good but why she's always almost naked ?
Does she have to be so sensual with every thing?
Is there nothing this woman cant do?😭😍
She did great! I think, what do u think country fans?
What a dumb video but the song is fun
When I heard Bey was going to do a country album I was like 🤔but I can’t lie I’m loving this vibe. A new single then the traditional country music she’s still Beyoncé and she kept that vibe behind a country beat and still hit versatile vocals. She amazing ❤❤
Is this really the music video? Or is it not done?
Why the singers need to promote vulgarity, nudity all the time now. You don't need to promote nudity it you really have talent. And this song is soo stupid. Only jealousy  of taylor that she is able to do pop and country at the same time.
Why does she have to be half naked?
Not a bad country joint there!  What kind of music can Beyoncé not make?
Song is ok but why can she & others put some clothes on?
When she gonna do Funk? Disco 🪩? Gospel? Return to R&B? Those genres really need her!
Button your top up so you dont look trashy and indecent. Didnt your momma raise you up to act better than that???
Aren't you a mother? Put some damn clothes on.
Did she ask permission to Dolly before doing this?😂
How can Beyoncé experience racism it’s unimaginable I mean she’s Beyoncé 🥺
We honestly don’t deserve the Queen 😢😢😢😢 is there anything she can’t do?!?  Sheesh I’m loving it. Let me get my cowboy hat and boots ready!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥 tic tok where the line dance at????
Have we forgotten our little ones  are watching? Why could not the same message be done without this extreme sexual vision and profanity lyrics?  This would have increased the fan base more? I can’t enjoy this music 🎼 with my grand babies let alone show the video.  I love 💕 Beyoncé.  But, I want to share this unique crossover vision with our younger generation to appreciate her wonderful contributions to the music 🎵 industry.
Why is the walk on repeat?
Hey its Beyonce! This Her Country Tune and these are Her Tits. Which one are We supposed to pay attention to?
When you say …. With cheeeeewww in a song ITS NOT COUNTRY!   This song is terrible !
this is awful. so obvious she didnt write it. she does not have a country voice. plus she is mega famous why does she have to put her tits out there for attention? isnt her status well above that or is her fame level dropping?
So this is fine but my favourite YouTuber can't say fuck?
Is this a joke? I'm bad at sarcasm.
What an incredible feat for the GOAT Queen.  Much respect
Who cares about my comment  now....hahahaha
She got the worst voice ever , why she famous ?
Satan worshipper What about the island?
The song is pretty good but the video sucks...it's just the same thing like 45  times  ??
I like the song but i'm so disappointed how ordinary Beyonce portraits herself. She's an icon for young girls and this is the example you wanna set?
Why does this remind of Jessica Simpson, boots made for walking, lol?
What a STUPID video. You’re a bazillionaire. This is the best you can do? Was there some point in repeating the same clip over and over again that I am too obtuse to understand?
Why doesnt she put clothes on? First song of hers I like.
Great video, the same 5 seconds over and over. WTF?
When do Beyoncé and Lady Gaga get together for another telephone?!
Are you kidding me....that's the worse country I've ever heard. And wth kind of video is that? This tramp needs to stay in her lane.
Why she dressed like a prostitute but she’s married. It’s a no for me.
What is she advertising  porn and human trafficking?
wow, this is so bad and i love country, my question is why?
what the is this garbage! This ain't country and our culture isn't your costume! This is culture appropriation.
Why does she have her jugs out?
I wonder if the CMAs are they going to treat her like lil Nas X
Who thought we all might line dance after a nice twerk on Beyoncés music 😂🤣
Does anyone know why some country music stations are rejecting this song? It  sounds more country than some country songs released in recent times.
Why does she have to be so naked??? She can sing, dance, writes etc. She has no need to
Why have to have tits out
Where do I find a book to bet on this winning album of the year?!
What is she trying to be? Not country music
Only 2 million views in 24 hours?
When you can't beat Taylor, so you start singing country whack whack
My first country concert coming up B?
Nice Satan snake over the left eye. Always gotta flash your Illuminati alligance huh?
I did not expect country music beat from Beyoncé ever! This is now different!?
Texas hold em? Hold her jugs?
What genre can Bey NOT sang? ...not 'Nan.... she's MULTI-TALENTED at MULTI-TASKING 💛
What a lot of you are not understanding is that Beyoncé is from Houston. She grew up on country. She is country. She was a fan of Selena Quintanilla, which is Mexican country music. She wants a change and there’s nothing wrong with that. Will country music except her with open arms maybe but it doesn’t mean she’s changed anything she’s just another artist trying to cross over.❤
Has she just ran out of stuff to do?? I love Bey, but this isn’t it for her imo.
Can this be real? I just now became a country music fan. Totally totally hot song!
This is atrocious. Horrible song. Bleached white skin on a black woman. Unnecessarily naked. Dumb video. Promoting guns in 2024. 😳 Really tacky. Really bad. Please make it go away.  This can’t be the official video. The same dumb posing on loop?
Wow we really just let Bey do whatever she wants now, huh?
WHAT the ACTUAL fark!! STOP bastardising the good ol boys Bae
Is she trying to mess w/ Taylor Swift?🤔
What is this weirdo on??!  "there's a tornado in my city, hit the basement that shit aint pretty."
since when is she white? LMAO michael jackson is that you?
MDR....COUNTRY TEXAS  PORNO. MUSIC...OU COMMENT FAIRE DU FRIC A MOINDRE COUT CLIP A CHIER ?
Why wait after the Super Bowl to release this?🤔
What can’t she do?! Like respect the talent she is blessed with. I still think she my cousin 😂
is this so she can go #1 on the country charts and not have to compete with taylor swift?
She can't win album of the year, so she changes genre?
Beyoncé representing San Marino at Eurovision Song Contest in Malmö with this song.... how do we make that happen???
Oh gawd. She’s gonna try to ruin country too? Cant she just stick to mediocre pop?
So when’s the Orville Peck collab?
Are y'all gonna buy this album? If you ask me it's still Beyoncé  music . Just calling it country lol
Tell me this… why does Queen Bey always winnnnn?
What the hell is she wearing?
When someone can sing, perform and dance at a top tier level like this—the only name that comes up is Beyonce. When someone is a mediocre singer, performer, bad dancer and white—several names come up. The most obvious is Taylor Swift.
I wonder if she will win album of the year now 😂😂😂
How is she gonna make me like country music? I hate country music. But  she's giving me a reason to love it. DAMMIT BEYONCÉ!!! LOL
Nervous to ask darling was that blue ivy on them vocals?
What corner is she working on
When RnB meets Country done by the best. 🎉
Why am I having to look at titties for a country song?
Why why always NaKED. I am so Tried of Beyonce always been naked, being this naked some how does not match here status 😭😭😭
Its a good song but why does she think she has to be half dressed to sell it??
She looks white or is it me?
Is that Rhiannon Giddens playing banjo!? LOVE HER.
WHO IS IT ???  it's BEE😉😉🐝❤
Did Lana say last week music is going country now? Hm :v
Have you seen this kind of thing before ?
I am tapping my feet while I type. When can we buy this god damn song?
WTF??????? Ok song, but the video?
CAN U PUT SOME DAME  CLOTHING ON, WHAT COUNTRY WESTERN SINGER IS HALF NAKED. Can she do anything with clothes on, and her husband cool with this{SHOWS HOW MUCH HE LOVES HER {HUH}???
Pop ur lexus? Is this music solely for the upper class now Beyonce? Hate that shit. What is this an add for the rich?
If anyone gets to touch me?
How can be home for months
Why did she bother to wear clothes??
I live with an airport and can't fly?
People are fighting me for what? Do I fiight back?
Is this her way of letting us know she's voting Trump2024😮?
Is this Beyonce tryna take over Taylor's forsaken territory? Lol
Cause you guys are older , you are beating me up? Cause my records are better? What? 2years older? 3years older? What's that? Are you mother ?
What a shit boring video,is that the best you can do Beyonce boring!!
When Beyoncé wins the best country album at the CMAs, the country industry will gagg 🤠🐴🤠🐴
When Beyoncé  makes a song bout your state ❤❤ love you!
When did you become country? Btw it’s so good
Would most of the peope like this if it wasn't Beyonce ?
Why should we see her boobs?
Did this video cost about £10 to put together? Just standing on a black floor with a black background?
Who's listening here from the Philippines?
Is there anything this woman can’t do???❤🐝
Next feature with jelly roll?  Luke combs??   Morgan wallen???
Ok but why do we need to see her almost half naked?
I wonder if Pharrell knew anything about this that’s why his Louis Vuitton line was Texas theme
do you know how many black women been trying to break into country music and beyonce just kicked the door down and took center stage?
Why bring wretched to Country that's not how they roll
Why does she have to be naked! Your voice is enough girl! No need for all of that. Too bad she cant see that. And she has a daughter looking up to her.
Has anyone noticed the silver cobra on her glasses? Hmm.
How many country bars she's been in how many card games has she played with out having a million in the bank.
You got the dance ready Bey???
WHERE IS THAT GIRL ON TIKTOK THAT SAID THAT BEYONCES NEW MUSIC WILL BE COUNTRY CAUSE SHE WAS WEARING A COWBOY HAT AT THE GRAMMYS
wow i'd be so proud of myself doing this while having children........... hahahahaha WTF is wrong with people ???
Is this her way of competing with Taylor to make sure she wins that album grammy next year? 🤣🤣 I guess she say "ok! America wants country... ima give you country"! 💀💀💀💀💀 This sound a mess.. i couldnt even finish the song... i was fast forwarding and everything... wth🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
why p*rn ? i never liked beyoncé but now even less.
I hope K Michelle is ok…. She’s been country singing for a while now.. Maybe a Collaboration will work???
I don't understand the video. What is going on?
why do poeole doesn’t like country ?? beyonce will show you how good it is
What the hell is this trash. Bey this is not it. I have always enjoyed different genres music country being one of those genres being country music and  she should have left this one to K. Michelle.
Where are the culture vultures at?? Right stfu next time
Can she get any more beautiful?
Queen Beyonce ❤❤❤ What can't you do?
when she said country she meant IT
Why isn't it enough in America to be a good musician...why aren't women prouder? Why do you think you can't win without nudity? Does your son or granddaughter want to see you like this?
Where is your visualizer at the old song "Break my soul" 😢😢😢.Your fans need it immediately 😅
What in the world is she wearing??
Why I am crying bruhh? Healing.. that's what her voice is.
a tracy chapman collabbbb in actII?????????
How dyall fix the dark glitch? Once i did a music video for my friend and it was very sad i could not keep the sepia dark tones background because it would keep glitchy on YouTube
I'm a Chi-town girl and sure, there have been some country songs that cross over from time to time.  The 16 Carriages song makes me think of a funeral procession carrying her pain and challenges, but at the end there should have been a flight where she is taking off victoriously and leaving it in the past. Still felt like she was carrying it.  I got enough of my own pains to carry. Sure acknowledge the struggles but where is the redemption?  Big question per Berry Gordy $1.00 would you buy the song or a sandwich?
When the beehive create the line dance let me know 😂 I gotta practice for the summer
Who the  fuck told her this was a good idea? This is the end of Beyonce and she deserves it to be. Sounds like absolute trash. So disappointed.
Can we preemptively begin the get Beyonce her AOTY Grammy campaign already?  Find Harry and Adele and make sure they are kept busy for a couple years. Just throw some pearls at Harry and tell Adele it'll be better if she waits a while and releases 40 as it's nice round number.  We need to do something about Taylor because Mama never fumbles.  Can Scooter Braun piss her off again and distract her? (and all of this is humor ... I am a fan of everyone I mentioned).
Beyonce is doing Second Album Coming out already ! I wonder what Act 3 genre is going to be?
Is anybody else going to go buy cowboy hats cowgirl hats cowboy boots cowgirl boots??
Who else is waiting impatiently for the line dance that will no doubt come with this song????
Did Beyoncé just make me like country?
What an absolute icon this woman is  ❤❤❤❤
I wonder who would play Beyoncé in a bio pic
I wonder if she and K. Michelle might collab... that would be awesome
When did this heffa have time to record this. I just can’t with her😂😂
Why do people forget she is from Texas
Where did she find the time to make new music, the tour only finished a few months ago?
Was lady gaga right all this time and we didn't see it at that time?
Where is the line dance Queen?????? We ready!!! ❤🤠🤠🤠🎊🎉🎊  As a black woman that was raised on country music I’m here for this! #Beyonce #MickeyGuyton
... and this Lady still hasn't won AOTY ? Hey Grammy's ?! WTF ?
Smells of desperation.  I mean come on - dabbling in an unlikely genre while showing your tits smells like a giant publicity stunt.  What's next - a Spanish language album?
Why does she have to be half naked. Let the singing speak for it self which is good by the way
When you have nothing to prove and you can do whatever you want as an artist! 👸🏼🐝🍯🌻💛
I’m confused. A singer or a topless dancer?
Why is dressed liked that?  Totally pathetic to say the least!  Peace
How will she perform country live with a rnb catolong?
Why is she announcing new music? Like.. before she dropped it before a announcement. What is different?
Why she wears like a bitch?! She's a mother so let her shows some respect to her kids!!
why to dress up like a cheap whooooore?  and this is what kids will see
How I love when she sings country. Like in Daddy Lessons. One of my favourite songs by her
why beyonce dont release music videos
When God made humanity, he did so that all the people of this good earth,
which is why Jesus took our punishment for us; all we need to do is repent for our sins and place our faith solely in him.
All I wanna know is will you be at the rodeo??
does this mean C&W wins?
I wonder if Bey & K-Michelle will make a song together this round.
Is there ANYTHING this woman can't do? Beyoncé give us a chance to breathe PLS
when you have to repeat the intro because its that good>>> oh yeah i will definitely be at this next beyonce tour🤠
Is it so hard to just give a proper visual to the music?
What she meant when she said “I carry” on my house
Reclaiming Country. I like it!! We need a spicy line dance now. Who’s going to choreograph it for the cookouts this summer?
Who cares about album of the year when we got music of the millennium!!!!!!????
Could anyone please clarify the situation? Has she released a new album?
Sooo did she wake up one day and just say, I wanna make a country album......... Or did her PR team make her do this?
I'm now a country music fan. Now, where can I learn to line dance?
I woke up to go to gym. Is it okay if I skip the chest day because I came upon this video and her verizon commercial?
Is it me or anyone else whos getting tired of nakes bodies?
Is there a genre she cannot do?? Wow this sounds like she’s been doing country her whole career.
What an embarrassment to country music. I was expecting something that at least had a little bit of SOUL. This garbage is not bringing country music back, this is the kind of garbage that killed country music.
Is this the start of a new album or just a few new singles she's releasing? Beyhive megafans, I'm asking you....
What can’t she do? Nothing.❤
Hold on is Beyoncé gonna make me start liking country music ???
Am I the only one that’s hearing rumi at the end of the song?
I love it. Beyonce you can not do no wrong. When should I by my cowgirl hat for this album?
Way too sleazy.  Why does she need to resort to this?
Why do i like this? I really do
Who starting the choreo for the line dance?
Is Grammys preparing AOTY for Bey??? 😂
she really said “drop the new music” on the super bowl commercial and then DROPPED IT!! who’s here before 1 mil??
How many babies she sacrificed child killer 😅
What can’t she do?!? 😭😭😭 as a black country fan this is absolutely everything!
What she’s doing is lead by example. Bringing brilliance and amazing artistry to everything she touches. The quality of what she’s putting out is always so inspiring. I can’t see any of the new artists (or older ones for that matter) getting close to her level.

What can this girl do! Beyoncé
The visualizer is giving me Telephone vibes??
Who care about Travis & Taylor “Super Bowl”!!!!! Beyoncé just dropped some new music , breaking the internet❤❤❤❤
I'm in the 1st million views, hbu?
Does everything have to be nude?? That kind of talent doesn’t have to stoop to that!  I’d like the little kids to hear and see this but it sure ain’t P-G!  It’s a shame!
What's this, a new álbum?
