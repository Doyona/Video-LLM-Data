Can someone point me out where is the kick by Haaland? Please
I watched the full highlights expecting to see Haaland scoring an overhead kick. 😴 Why was ESPN comparing his imaginary effort to Cristiano’s?
Is Ederson no longer elite? Playing for a team like City, he doesn't have much to do most matches, and yet he still manages to make more mistakes than you would expect him to, given the circumstances.
Can you bring back shorter highlights?
How is Copenhagens goalkeeper not mentioned. The guy had a man of the match performance and single handedly  denied Halland all game. Underrated and classy goalkeeper 👏
For many of you who watch most of City's game, do you think that Pep uses Haaland correctly? I feel like the not only dont do him justice, but when I am able to watch the game, I feel like Haaland should have more aerial presence or more plays for him since he is so lethal. Am I trippin?
Where is the highlights of the injuries, randomly there is new player on the pitch
Was KdB 1 goal and 2 assists? Too lazy to rewind.
Why they put the bottle of water close the Goal to make a Target with with shoots for goals 😅😅😅
MC was aiming the water bottle near the post? Good job.. p.s never put the water bottle near the post, also it should not be legal?
What a pass on that last goal
why would I ever assume that Man City get a tough draw in the round of 16?
What a performance from KDB , honestly city’s best player , he’s just the brains 🧠 of the midfield
So it was DeBruyne and 10 others?
Why did they change the beginning to a women 😐
