Anyone else think she looks like a different person from the audition?
Sorry, but this is awful!  You told her she could sing??
Why she kept saying cold miner I can't figure out.
why she make her voice squeaky maybe cus she’s young
And she didn't win the season why?
Would she really have gotten through if she wasn’t Lauretta Lynn’s granddaughter though?
Why do all these voices from the last 10 years or so sound like underdeveloped breathy baby voices?
Who else is crying here?! WoW
What season and episode was this from??
why did she have to trigger our tearducts like that-🥲that was so beautiful.
Why is it allowed for relatives of rich and famous singers to be contestants on shows such as American Idol or The Voice? They already have an advantage of having the money and exposure from their own relatives for easy stardom. These greedy people are actually taking the spot away from a regular Jane or Joe who are truly great singers, but don't have the money or access to easy exposure. This should not be allowed because they are basically being pushed aside and robbed from an opportunity of a lifetime that will otherwise never happen.
What a beautiful way to honor her grandmother. She must be looking down so proud.
Freeze the video at 1:54, lol. What's going on here?
When she went into that “whoaaaa” near the end I was melting like butter in a skillet.
Hello, May I share the most important news you will ever hear in your entire life? God the Father sent His holy Son Jesus Christ(Y'shua Ha' Mashiach) from heaven to earth, to be born of a virgin. He grew up and died on the cross for our sins.  He was put into a tomb for 3 days, and then Abba Father raised Jesus to life and He appeared to people and went back to Heaven.  We must all sincerely receive Jesus to be a true child of God.  It says in John 1:12 "But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name." Will you genuinely believe on Christ Jesus and truly receive Him today, before it is too late?
What was Luke pointing at? 1:24
When she started belting it out, I lost it 😭
Why change the tune of the song?  Originality is best. Doesn’t have the same feel at all  Emmy does have a beautiful voice though. ❤
Why do I feel like Patsy Cline and Loretta are looking down on this baby and just proud as they can be
What watch am i on? I lost count. She pulled out the confidence AND ALL the notes!!! YES EMMYYYYYY
What a beautiful song! I wasn’t following American Idol until I accidentally clicked through the channels and heard this song that brought me to tears. Why am I not listening to this on the RADIO NOW!!! BEAUTIFUL You got my VOTE!!! ❤❤❤
Why is it that we constantly get flogged with Emmy as "Loretta Lynn's granddaughter?" She truly believes she isn't Emmy, she is Loretta Lynn's granddaughter, Loretta Lynn's granddaughter, and don't you forget it! Who is Emmy??? Emmy, come out and show yourself if you believe in yourself!
Did she go off key a bit?
What a beautiful tribute to her Memaw Loretta Lynn ❤🎉.  Her mother in the audience crying was so touching ❤.  Best of luck to Emmy Russell 🎉🎉🎉 . She definitely has a great future in the music industry ❤🎉
Why did she have to slow it down and ruin it, just do it the way it's supposed to be. It's not supposed to be sad or sappy.
What an amazing version by Emmy. It was as beautiful as Megan's Coach's Pick last season.
