Is it possible that as he ages he will begin to look younger?

Anyone have any idea what Ricardo might have said to Luke ??
What did ricardo say to litler 27:10
If you think D20-bull is a poor choice of finish why would you be upset that your opponent goes for it?
What a final! Ever since Cross took out Taylor in his swan song, I've never cared much for him, but he grows on me every time I see him play. A bundle of class and talent. Well played to both!
Can someone explain to me why Pietreczko was angry and had a bad behave with Littler? I can't understand
how can you not love Rob Cross,  just as happy for his opponents 9 as he is for his own ! Bravo Rob! 🥰
What a joke Pikachu is😂 as a german i really like most of our players, but he is just such a sore loser...  And to have the audacity to make an Instagram story saying "i hope he get's punished by his arrogance"🤦🏼‍♂️
I wonder if he acts like that when he loses a game of Pokemons?
WHAT AN ABSOLUTE LEGEND DARTS ARE BACK WITH LUKE THE NUKE , ITS SUCH A JOY TO JUST WATCH HIM PLAY ,
At 27'10" what did Recardo say to Littler?
What a top guy rob is ! ...... sprints up in my respect
What was pika crying about after his match with littler?
I would consider myself a darts casual, could someone explain why Ricardo was angry at Luke?
Can anyone tell me what's the tune at the end there?
Is it absolute scenes, or is it not?

What a player luke littler! Breaking records, smashing 9 darters. Winning 2 tournaments in his first senior tour. Im excited to see how far he can go!! What a talent
Both players brought their A game in the final. Do these results count in the Order of Merit?
why was that skinny kraut having a pop at littler for
What was said between littler and the German geezer??? Littler didn't seem impressed at all like
How sad is that Pitreschko? Always respected and supported the likes of Clayton, Cross etc who are great and respectful winners and losers
what is the euro tour why is it different to things like the bahrain masters and other stuff
Littler is absolutely amazing, 3 debuts in "tournament types", 3 nine darters. Best teenager ever?
Anyone knows what Ricardo said to Luke? Luke looked disgusted/confused??
Pikachu what the heck was that. Mad that someone is checking out in unorthodox ways?
What a great competition. Makes me want to go down to the next one. That Luke Littler 9 darter was just mad too
What a great final, nine dart perfection! Congrats Luke Littler.
