was thar iain wright with maedas family?🎉
Who on earth would call Celtic or the Scottish league good. I’m a very logical and reasonable person but this league of for tries to act like superstars and fans of a very mediocre club to act big time. I looooove football. I know football. But the fake hype around the Scottish prem is real and mad. Overpaying for average players… silly. Our cast off became your superstars… it’s not a stretch to say some English Sunday sides would give Celtic a game
Why don't they play until someone wins? This is like if a basketball game was tied and they decided the result by a game of "HORSE".
Have to laugh at all the bitter rangers fans as they have selective memory syndrome!! Silva diving for a pen in the moral victory game and Goldson blatant handball v Celtic which wasn't given?? Hypocrites every one of them
why both these teams are weak in the champions league  ???????
Why were the Celtic defenders doing a Nazi salute for the 1st goal?
What passion from Hatate after he scored his penalty
Why are there so many irish flags in the stadium if both sides are from scotland??
Why have they cut out Rangers massive 4 on 1 chance on 51 mins? Also the 2 penalty claims mysteriously not there 🤔
What a final  Losing on pens is an absolute heartbreaker
What a match it was. Mixed feelings about it 1. Its a loss so its pretty shit 2 im glad the players fought until the end and showed signs of improvement the past couple weeks. Now its time to battle on and see where we go from here.
How tf they won a trophy and we're not even at the half of the season what is this league
One question . Who cares About scotland ?
WHY CARNT THEY HAVE HOME AND AWAY FANS IN THE LEAGUE FIXTURES? MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE
Was that Ian Wright amonthe fans celebrating at the end ?
WHY THE FUCK did you have to put the result of the game on the video's title? Why do you pricks do that?
Was that Ian Wright I seen there at the end aye?
Why would you comment pretending to be a smelly hun just to say Rangers fan here gg.. get a fukn life man.
What a game in that 2nd half really think we got lucky today though that chance with igamane he plays the ball to left two rangers player where away but he gave it to the player on the right should have been 2 nil at that point game would have been over but even on a worst days we still own them😂
Who’s the guy with glasses beside maedas family after penalty?
who are these gimps in the comments acting mutual for some likes on their comment 😂 clowns
Why rangers  manager  don't  let  bajrami playing  hi keep  replace  in bajrami  all time   .I think  the manager   ned too  get sack
What was Butland doing for that final pen 😂
What is even point of Scottish football? Rangers and Celtic might as well play couple of games for the league and the cups.
I never watched the match  Did they also play 15 mins each half of extra time for 120 minutes total or did they just go straight from 90 to pens?  If they draw after 90 mins in Scottish Cup Final assuming they meet each other will they scrap the extra 30 mins and just go straight to Pens?
Why is there just so much hate
Why do the rangers fans barely celebrate their goals? Most of them appeared to be standing still even after the last minute equaliser?
When cheating chidren out their innocence just isn’t enough.
What a game!! An Excellent advert for Scottish football absolutely an amazing game had everything. I watched Tottenham play Rangers on Thursday and thought they should have beaten Tottenham so I knew Celtic would have it tough and it went all the way.👍 Also special mention to Diazen what a work horse that guy has  endless energy and a superb goal took down with the right and scored with his left to class.
Why is it Scottish league with Irish fans 🤔
How terrible were Celtic fans? Didn't even hear them
What was the final score for celtic and rangers
When you Die where will you go?  pray, Jesus forgive me of my sin, save me ,be my Lord & my Saviour, you have come in the flesh, died & risen for me, Jesus is my Lord ! Amen. Read John 3.
How good is it that they are happy not getting pumped but actually making a game of it. We were well off it first half, they played their best and still couldn't win.  That was better than a 5-0 d Humping coz they thought they nearly won it. 😂😂😂😂
Did the game go straight to penalties after full-time ?
What a game rangers gave everything but today came to soon.  Well played celtic it was a good final
WHAT A FUCKING GAME 🎉🎉 COULDN'T ASK FOR ANYTHING BETTER
