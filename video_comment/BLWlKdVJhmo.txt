Vamo Lucho Vamo Darwin Vamo Vamo MacAlister
Liverpool were so robbed
Wrexham
When you deal drugs in Colombia, you get kidnapped from time to time 🇨🇴
Nunez needs to work on his finishing and he will be amazing
I think because Luton did so well with getting a draw and the Luton fans where so friendly and jolly with their chanting we kiverpool shouod give them a free tour of our trophy room
People should start respecting players even if they miss an open goal they are still good
I am incredibly happy for the columbian
Well done Luis
GREAT defending by trent again. lol
Although I am sad Luton didn't win I am happy that it was Diaz to score best of luck.
Brighton fan here but I'm massively happy for Diaz. Can't imagine what they trying to deal with.
I think Darwin misses Diaz on the left, had that first effort gone in he’d probably have got a hat trick, I’ve faith he’s coming so close lol  All credit to Luton wish them all the best in the season and just great having Lucho back 🙏🏻💙YNWA
As a gooner i predicted spuds to win either 2-0 or 3-1 😂 i hate chelsea aswel but its beautiful to see
Abysmal ref, Liverpool could have had multiple more set pieces and penalties
Luton’s fans are a disgrace. Tragedy chanting and chanting about luis Diaz dad. The statement from Luton about it was also a disgrace. So glad they’re gonna go down and will hopefully drop a couple more divisions after that.
Diaz scoring was a nice thing, bless him!
As a Manchester United Fan we'll done Luton Town I never thought that would be a draw
Thats pen all day long, city got one against united and was nowhere bad as that one on Vvd
Respect 🫡 to Luton for the draw
Luton played very well and kept their shape incredibly well.  Liverpool on the other hand were abysmal. Why oh why do you have to play Trent down the centre?   Throughout the game both flanks were empty, why not keep Arnold on the right. Why start with Gomez down the left? I was mystified throughout the game.   The game was so dense down the centre all the space was down the side. I thought for sure Klopp would have spotted it at half time.  We have 3 or more quality midfielders why push Trent down the middle? We lose a player who should be on the right hand side and is one of the best crosser in the game. Szobodzlai is also accomdating the position change and when Robbo is in the team, he cannot bomb as often which is incredibly frustrating to watch.  I cannot understand.   When we won the title was Trent down the centre? We have more than capable midfielders now.   Van Dijk used to play cross field passes to the flank, if Arnold was there with Salah it would have created extra space.   The centre of the park did not need an extra player.  Well played Luton but part of your success was poor man management from the gaff.  Nunez reminds me of when Torres played for Chelsea. So inconsistent.
Hurry up and put Spurs getting beat 4-1 on plz
As a Liverpool fan I was quiet disappointed because of how we did that game we need to do better if we want to win the league who agrees with me?
Glazing from carra😂😂😂😂😂
noice
Honestly Klopp has every reason to be angry with refs!. Still not forgot Tottenham disaster this one a hand ball that should have been a penalty for Liverpool, turned as a goal for Luton!!.
Tragedy chattin by the Luton fans have no respect get no respect  hopefully they'll be gone out of the prem with their bike shed staduim not fit for purpose
Liverpool getting lucky again
Nunez! Come on! Need that cut out those silly misses from his game. Speak to Luis Suarez mate, he will help you! Early days Suarez made the same mistakes, but improved rapidly. Salah didn’t show up either! A game to be forgotten!
Respect for diaz❤❤
Is no1 else amazed by how that isn’t a pen on van dijk? I’m a Chelsea fan so no bias but that’s a pen all day, I honestly don’t understand the rules anymore
Liverpools troubles of last season have not gone away. This should have been a 3 pointer for Liverpool.
Boooooooo
nunez played as if his parents were kidnapped
Luton had the scousers almost beat there
Don't care about the result just so happy for Diaz I hope his story has  a happy ending!
8 minutes added on its like the new rule is let’s keep playing till liverpool score
Chon
Why would Liverpool take the field in such a dreadful kit?  It's live on Sky. Millions around the world are watching. Have they no self-respect?
As a Liverpool supporter... firstly, well done Luton for a good performance and deserved goal .. Excellent goal by Dias that saved us an embarrassing defeat... Come in Liverpool, find the back of that net, and work on your shocking defence 🙄
Nunez should have put Liverpool out of sight. Liverpool look casual for most the game their tempo was right. Credit to Luton for getting something from the game.
I,am sorry to say it but Nunes is a liability, it's no use getting into positions to score if you can not score the simplest of goals, get rid of him and buy a decent striker Jürgen.
Love how the Luton winger rips two Liverpool players and all that Jamie can say is that’s world class keeping.. the most bias commentary
Typical Liverpool 🤦‍♂️😡 Always nicking results from the underdog 😡🤦‍♂️😡
Big up Diaz 🙏🏼🔥
Is Nunez even a striker
Seriously Liverpool don't go back to this,struggling to beat shite teams that everyone else walks over.
nunez so average lmao
clear own goal from luton defender.
Sorry but Nunez a child could score that
so proud of our boys
Diaz❤️🔴💯
Nice for Chong to score against the scousers
Bill Leslie> Peter Drury  Emphasis on power of Simplicity Rather than power of conplexity. Drury would probably go on how hats can feel a taste, I use a hat for sunlight and looking good mate. He will have a field day if theres a bust tonight, he is a nice guy but he overcooks his whole commentary every game
BENCH NUNEZ IVE HAD ENOUGH! He’s going to cost us cups! He’s not good enough for Liverpool
I don't know how nunez is still playing for Liverpool, he is so bad its hard to watch. He can make the runs but finishes 10% of the time. He is so overrated!
Pretty sure that was an OG
How can he even play a full match with his father kidnapped? It must be hard
Nunes is a sheet l dont know how he play for liverpul 😅
Tottenham or Arsenal would never hear the end of it if they dropped points at Luton. Terrible from Liverpool
Well done Diaz. But we need to give credit to Luton for the pressing and the performance
Shameful Luton fans tragedy chanting. Otherwise fair play to luton.
Diaz didn't celebrate, he must be so mixed up inside and constantly worrying. Wha t a warrior
Big Lucho ❤
Liverpool couldn’t beat Luton lol
What a fitting end to the game for Diaz, so deserved. Meanwhile I'm still trying to process that miss from Nunez
I feel sorry for Nunez, the meme that he has become clearly affects his confidence
Nunez is wildy unpredictable lol
DIAZ DIAZ DIAZ
Diaz …….ynwa
1-1 at Luton embarrassing happy for  Diaz
Own goal.
If united draw to Luton watch the hate that follows
Well done the Luton goalkeeper. You kept out at least 5 from the first half alone.  Job well done.  A lovely Luton goal from a single opportunity created from a quick break.  Exciting stuff, from the few minutes shown.
A complete neutral to this match but much respect to Diaz. The heart ache he must be having in his personal life and him being able to single that out and not effect his personal game is fascinating and something I definitely couldn’t do let alone alot of the current players in todays game. Much respect 🫡
Stuffy scruffy scousers again haha
Sorry but nunez shouldn't be starting ahead of Gakpo. He simply can't finish reliably, misses sitter after sitter.
Nunez 😂
Nunez could have had a hat trick of tap ins and in the end he scored no goals
Liverpool drawing with a small town team… Manchester United would never draw with a small team. What’s going on Liverpool?
Nunez, the most prolific non-goal scorer of his generation.
Chong was well offside
as much as i would’ve loved to have seen pool lose, it’s beautiful that diaz got that moment.
Nunes 😂😂😂😂😂
Good ‘un Luton hahaha
Carragher is an Everton fan at heart. Loves sticking the boot into Liverpool.
Salah’s header was just as bad as Nunez’s miss, but Nunez took all the spotlight!
AND that is why liverpool won't win the prem this season..got to beat these sides.  Darwin nunez misses are not helping the team
Liverpool not giving yet another peno. I suppose if vvd was rodri it'd be giving
Respect to Luton everyone thought they would get battered like 0-5
Nothing on VVD Mr Carragher ,He just lost the 50/50 no?
Unlucky Hatters
Diaz 🤞🏾💙
As soon as I saw the result I lamented that Liverpool have got to stop failing to put away these kind of fixtures against low positioned opposition esp when they need to keep the pressure up in the top teams !!😮
Luton very close to winning this game but respect for Diaz scoring a goal with the situation he is in. ❤
Absolutely insane how Rodri gets a penalty for Rasmus hojland having his arm extended. Then vvd is dragged to the floor by his neck and it’s a no penalty. The premier league referees are corrupt to the core. Just look at arsenal newcastle
Klops face 😂 how Liverpool has changed.still missing that fab-mane trio thing
ruined by Charagerrs comments -  repeatedly repeating nonsense
Simply a Núñez masterclass.
We looked good attacking...poor finishing
Fair play to Luton for nearly pulling off an shock of the season. Play like that the rest of the season at home just might keep u in the premiership
No but seriously…HOW IN HOLY HAZELNUTS DID NUNEZ NOT SCORE?!
Respect to Diaz for sure but man im so gutted Luton didnt get that win
As a Liverpool fan maybe time to just bring in a striker that is average but puts away sitters instead of a striker that has “ so much potential “😂
Absolutely love you Diaz
May Diaz's Father Be Returned Home Safe & Sound.
Manchester supports Diaz through this tough time, rivalry aside! What a player ❤
Wont save diaz daddy
Liverpool are actually the worst, talk about punching down
Not the type of Chong we wanted on A sunday but fair enough
Ynwa luis
Darwin misses the easiest chances and scores outrageous goals. He is the personification of chaos
liverpool are FINISHED
Respect for Diaz can’t imagine what he is going through to still being playing fair play
Scoring tap-in isn't for everyone
🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴🙏🙏🙏💛💙❤️
Great great football club, Liverpool,,,
Nunez should never had side footed that he should've of just toe poked it instead.
Did the Liverpool players struggle with luton pitch today?
liverpool are no where near title challengers
Forget Darwin’s miss, they are harder than people think when you have all that time to think about it. Nunez actually impressed me, he was confident in his approach and he was popping shots off for fun and they were all decent efforts, just not his day today. Luis Diaz I am so happy for, what a warrior, what a footballer and we are so lucky to have him ❤️🫡
Such a shame for luton 😢
In 47 yrs supporting LFC I don’t think I’ve ever seen them as poor
WOW just WOW Great defending from Nunez @2:09 which then went on for them to score....You could not make that up.    🤣🤣👌👌
Everyone bleating on about what Diaz is going through, can't be that hard for him, he's still playing
Diaz is what I would call, true strength, perseverance, hope and staying strong 💪🏾 even in the most difficult of times. Darwin is what I call shocking, missing OPEN GOALS even when handed the Ball on a Plate. Just can't see him last long if he keeps doing that.
Hahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahaha
Nunez is laughable.
Shoutout to Diaz. Didn't get his dad but got a sick goal. Legend!
what did it say on his shirt man how u gonna do him like that let him spread his message
kaminski was on fire. Diaz just had to score. Not a prem stadium tho is it.... surprised their allowed to use it.. but lutton did deserve a point.
How does darwin nunez do this. Missing sitters. Scorin worldies
It's results like this that will leave Liverpool out of contention for the title at the end of the season.. Well done to Luton though on a great performance.
So happy for Diaz
Very very very very lucky Liverpool 😁. They can lose whit Luton Town. Luton Town congratulations. Good game. Godbless.
Mc calister is dog shite, Endo should be being played he offers a lot more.
So it's now ok to push down on defenders to win a header?....the Diaz goal only stood because people are feeling sorry for him, and tbf this situation his farter is in is completely of the families making.  The second Diaz became successful the kidnapping risk for his family shot up, they should have hired security and moved to a more secure house.
Get in the bin scousers
Klopp must have complained a lot to get additional 8 minutes
Liverpools inability to beat low block teams like this is the reason they will never beat City to the title.
To the video editor you could have at least shown the message that Diaz revealed under his shirt. Libertad para papa or 'freedom for dad'
of course it was Chong to score against Liverpool 😂
Darwins misses are beginning to get less amusing..
United will not win a prem for 30 years and still have won more prems than Liverpool. Klopp you couldn't lace fergies boots. Dosser.
And how you slag off the SPL for quality?🤔 Those highlights were worse than the Scottish Championship 🤣
Unbelievable from Diaz. All the best to him and his family.
Luton unlucky not to hold on but credit to Diaz aswell Nunez how on earth he missed us the worst I've seen since kanu at WBA
Nunez can never be a goalscorer. He misses so many sitters.
Luton deserve more credit everyone writing them off but hopefully today ppl will realise don’t forget Luton spent 10 million and Liverpool 620 million
haaland wouldve scored that nunez tap in
Great result 👏👏👏👏  Well played Liverpool to get a point v Luton
Flipping heck! Nunez is worse than Lukaku.
salah 50p head
I hate Liverpool let me just make that clear. But if City got a pen in the derby for the Højlind foul, how do Liverpool not get one for the challemge on Van Dijk?
Brilliant stuff from Diaz.  But I would have to question whether or not Nunez is really worth a starting place ahead of Gakpo or Jota.  And Carragher is one of the worst pundits to be next to the commentator, morals are equal to that of an alley cat.
Should have been five up after 60 mins but Liverpool's finishing not the best lately. Klopp maybe should have played 442 instead of 433 to give extra strength in the midfield. Good goal by Diaz - respect for what he is going through.
Correct decision not giving a handball, but not sure why Saliba's against Chelsea was one, then...
McAllister is so poor, Luton’s goal came from his mistake. Again he makes mistakes tackling in midfield..🤔 he’s a midfielder, but to slow, not strong enough so far he’s a disappointment . Liverpool are sooo slow in their build up with none of the Liverpool players moving.. awful. Nunez.. what a sitter terrible.
I am a Luton fan but fare play to Diaz we are all with you ❤
Sumone plz shut that the crap up on carragher he is so biased its unbelivable
With everything this man has been through and still manages too come off the bench and score so much respect for him ❤️🙏❤️🙏
On a scale of 1-10 how shits nunez
Imagine drawing against luton and having inflated extra time save you hahaha
Liverpool 9 out 10 goals conceded because the right back is not even there. The other 1 is when he just plays defence with his eyes and leaves attackers going past him like he doesn't exist.
Nunez is not good enough. I hold my hands up, it was me who brought him to the club. Something that I deeply regret now. I had a word with klopp and he said he could make him into a good player. But that isn't working.
Liverpool should've had a penalty for a handball that fits into the rule of a handball.
I'm guessing klopp wants a replay
If that Nunez shot goes in off the bar this game is a completely different game, LFC at their best when they 1-0 up and hit u on the counter when u have to open up! Only a Luton fan wud begrudge Diaz the equalizer, he obviously can’t celebrate any goal till his father is returned 🤞🙏 hopefully soon! YNWA! Ps Didn’t know Luton fans so mouthy some of the filth /trash coming out of their mouths why they so angry 🤔
Nunez 1 liverpool 1
What a ham!!
Nunez is terrible atm when he pops off he's unreal
Why do Liverpool keep changing their uniform to these weird colours? Liverpool are known as red don’t change that
missed the header , lucky goal off his shoulder.
Nunez isnt it.  Had numerous folk tell me 'he'll get 30 a season'  Maybe he will, and if he does i can categorically say,  'he should of had 60!'  The man hasnt got the composure or instincts of a natural finisher. He's more athelete than  footballer. Sub par technically and tactically. He looks good as he's strong, fast and aggressive. He seems exciting and unpredictable because even he doesnt know what he'll do next, as he doesnt even know what he's doing in the moment.  Ill be very suprised if he finishes his contract with the club as a regular starter. Acceptable of the bench as a plan b or against some opponents but isn't  good enough to be the main CF for a PL team looking to dominate games and seriously compete in all comps.
with 11 men liverpool couldnt beat luton!  yet when spurs did with 10 men, all the liverpool fans could say was its only luton! lol
Amazing
Warra dad for Diaz.
Unacceptable from luton allowing the scum to score!!
Swear if Nunez can work on his finishing he can be the best striker in the world
Bench Nunez immediately. Prefer Jota or Gakpo in the middle. Ma guy was shooting every time he got the ball 😂 and misses easy open goals.
The nunez miss off of salahs knock down.  They say 'the flag is up' Why is it up?  Havent the offivials been told to keep it down unless glaringly obvious? To let VAR do its job ajd look at it retrospectively. Salah doesn't look offside in the freeze frame. It isn't why nunez missed of course, but a flag can, will and has affected the play and players in the past.  Same 'mistake' that cost liverppol against Newcastle just a month or so back.
"THE MAN BEHIND THE MASK "?BY PROF VEITH POWERFUL WATCH ❤
the intensity, the drive of players from both teams... commendable! they're in there to work! impressive
Criminal for a PL player to miss these sitters, costly.
Elliott was incredible today reds 🙏🙏
Absolutely an embarrassment by liverpool
Liverpool were awful at defending and nunez needs ten chances to score   Fair play to Luton but the Hillsborough chants   Luis Diaz 😢😭
Suarez would have scored a hattrick...difference between him and nunez. Liverpool need salah competition, a good finisher and a cdm.
I wanted Liverpool to lose 😂
ynwa diaz
Luton’s goalkeeper is brick wall.
I refuse to believe Darwin Nunez is a real person
Nunez literally plays rugby 😅
We are all with you Diaz ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Nunez missed quite a few chances and the easiest one. Salah was not offside. Had he scored and it checked. would have been given.
We'll keep on playing until the moaners equalise.  That was hard on Luton.  The amount of injury time allocated is criminal but Mister Klopp wouldn't have it any other way.
Nunez..
Worst lfc performance this season but if Nunez scored one of his 65 efforts it would have been a very different result
Diaz turns up for work as expected Professionally.  Praying for him personally
and people still think Nunez is a good striker lmao
First time this season.... klopp got it wrong. Why play gomez at left back? Nunez is quality but he is only at his best against teams that come out to play or when they are tierd. Yes Elliott got the assist but no way is he good enough to replace Gravenberch. 2 points dropped here.
The way Nunez hit the winner against Bournemouth was so unorthodox, it was incredible. With the same foot, he doesn't tap the ball into the net at Luton. When his English is good enough, perhaps he can start seeing a sports psychologist.
Poor Luton, you had a feeling that was coming when 8 minutes got held up. They deserved a shock win today, fair play for that performance.
Luton will be back where they belong soon.championship.
Fair play Diaz!
So thats not handball but Salibas from 1cm away is? What?
Nunez miss reminds me of rocket Ronnie's miss in the 90s
Diaz Reds did it❤
😊 COYS
how dare you edit out his message for his father
Luton robbed by a smaller club sadly.
You'd think Flopp would train Nunez on his finishing the fact he misses 9/10 3 yard sitters
Nunez misess
That is one emotional game, don’t know which moment is emotional, Luton nearly winning, or Diaz scoring a equaliser with him showing his support for his missing family on his undershirt.
Nunez missing sitters again and costing us the game
Nunez needs selling - I'm sorry - thousands of pounds a week for that miss - no composure in front of goal. Needs to go.
As much as I didn’t want Liverpool to score, I’m happy for Diaz to have something to lighten his mood even if it is just a little bit
Nunez and bar bloody hell
Sky Sports making this all about Liverpool getting a thrilling equaliser when the story should be about Luton nearly beating them
8 minutes added really, helping Liverpool out there
Shocking from Liverpool 💀💀
No wonder how much that guy  won who bet on team to draw or Luton Town to win cause seems like Luton Town team  work harder and better than anyday😊😊😊❤❤❤
The boys let Diaz down today. We should have never been in a position where we needed him to come on. We are playing Luton, we should be hammering them and putting ourselves in a good position for the title race. Whereas we had to rely on a player who's is going through something I hope none us should go through, and yet he comes on to rescue a point. Diaz has added to the already high respect we have for him, but shame on the rest of the lads, utter shame.
Poor Luton. Fodder. They meeded to win this one for momentum and belief. Instead... nada.
Nunez is back to the peak of his form and respect for Diaz...
A hideous performance from Liverpool and a resilient one from Luton, they deserved to win.  YNWA Lucho 🙏🏽🫶
On my 21st birthday i saw us scrape a win away against grays athletic and on the 35th we almost scalped liverpool! What a journey! Ogbene pure class,  COYH!
scouse gets
I did not see that result coming! Gutted for Luton, good for Diaz' family. Hope his situation gets resolved positively asap.
Nunez is absolutely fascinating. How can you go from a prime fernando torres....to darius vassell in the matter of a couple nights sleep. Totally fascinating.
Devastated. Wanted a Luton win
The small team drawing in the late moments is truly special
Saw his folks down the nags head early today and having a great ole time, dont believe all that nonsense bout been missin 😂
Diaz is a real one, he is built different to be able to perform like that, respect
Chong is the most skillful player Luton have 👍
Embarrassing performance, typical of us not to get the 3 points
Fair play to Luton. Great owners, great story, good manager, decent hard-working players. Shame the fans weren't above the usual tragedy and poverty chanting but no different to any other club's fans I guess.  Liverpool? Another case of expecting to turn up and roll over a so called lesser team. Not good enough, but take the point and move on.
Did anyone else see Salah’s reaction to Nunez miss 🤣🗿
Trent and Nunez back to their comedic best 😅😅😅
Diaz fouled the defender for the equaliser
Sunderland AFC 👑.
We’re with you Diaz, even as a spurs fan ❤
Don't know why Salah put his hands on his head fur nunes miss, that header was a shot not a pass.
DIAZ THE GOAT 🐐 ❤YNWA💚
As a united fan I actually am very happy for Diaz, prayers and thought are with you bro stay strong
Cannot keep defending nunez, he cost us. Poor finishing, uncomposed, not in control, just rash and hit with power and hope for the best. He is so unreliable, wasteful and this time it cost us points.
Less than useless Nunez has proved he can't hit the target and has no scoring instinct. He is the reverse of Ian Rush and should be dropped and transfer listed. Enough is enough
Nuñez nearly sent it flying out of the stadium there...💀
I don't know what's funnier the fact Irish guy thought it would be 7 - 0 or the fact Liverpool drew with Luton 😅
luton played dirty
disgusting that sky would edit out Diaz' celebration.  LIBERTAD PARA PAPA
Football is just poetic at times
Diaz as a rangers 💙 fan I am with u
So the Liverpool supporters celebrate as though they had scored in the cup final. When in reality they scrambled to scrape a Draw 😅
Happy Diaz got a goal but 1-1 against Luton is actually sad ngl
1:32 how did Nunez missed this? 5 years old kid can score this😂😂😂
If there was an award for the biggest miss, Darwin Nunez would win it 😂😂😂
Luton Town, great resilience and tactical battle. Shocking from the LTFC fan base, but expect nothing less from one of the worse places to live. And I know, I live just outside the shithole.
Lucky luton now burnley going down
Nunez has missed about 17 sitters this season, when is the media gonna notice??
Theres a million minutes added time in prem games this sesson
Fair play to Diaz
Diaz
Luton brilliant today respect to Díaz so brave to play under those circumstances
Well played Luton gave us a good game and arguably should of one but respect to Diaz for saving us after what he been through. Ynwa
Saved from total embarrassment. Thank you Luis Diaz. That's 4 points dropped against Luton and Brighton where one might argue should have been differerent outcomes.
if they equalised im glad it was Diaz to do it
I don't want to come across as mean or anything but I am fed up of players celebrating goals and then making some kind of political statement or the like , it's tedious 😡
Whats the difference between that foul on VVD and the foul on Rodri?
¡Libertad para papá!
Ogbene skinned Trent down the sideline, 😅
Diaz a monster despite his hard time he’s still scoring
Somethings are just poetry and meant to be lovely to see Diaz score and nice message hopefully his dad is found safe and sound from a Man United Fan
I’m don’t support liverpool but All love to Diaz ❤
Unfortunately Nunez will be remembered more for missing open goals than his footballing ability and I’m a Liverpool fan.. he needs to start working on his finishing because Jesus what was that 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
We were awful today. Glad we snatched a point, thanks to Luis Diaz, bless him ❤
Disgraceful chants from the Luton fans today, hopefully they get relegated.
This bullying on Trent needs to stop. He just gets bullied all the time on the wing, where was the lunch monitor when this bullying took place?   Then at the other end of the lunch table you have Nunez who disrespectfully cannot finish his meal  Disgrace
What a game for Luton could have easily won this game ❤
What a moment for diaz. I prey to God that his parents are safe. Definitely an emotional moment
love it ex utd player scoring against the dippers 😂
Heads held high luton, grea performance. You might not have a lot of quality compared to most in the league but bit do you have the heart and that counts for a lot more than people give credit to.
dirty scousers 😅 has klopp demanded a replay yet😅
Lets go Luton i always had hope we would atleast get a point against such a big club. To be perfectly honest thought we were going to get battered but nothing beats championship ball wheeeey
Well done Luton.🇮🇪👏👏👏...
If we can't beat Luton then we have absolutely no chance of winning the league!
Free Papa! Lucho we are here for you and we love you bro ❤
Well hell cant beat a team like Luton wow not good enough at all............
i hate liverpool but we’re all rooting for diaz, some things are bigger than football
He scored with his shoulder 😂
Respect to Lucho.. You'll never walk alone.
Well done Luton. We was really poor today. Maybe try Matip at DM number 6.
Scores a screamer from 20 yard out vs Bournemouth and then misses from 3 yards out vs Luton.. ladies and gentlemen, Darwin Nunez
So happy for lucho
Slaging of spurs 😂😂 you stole a point
Macca only passes backwards that’s seriously all I see him do   Kostas looks on about 20 mins sleep and has no physical always slips always fouls people   Darwin can score a volley from outside the box but can’t score an open goal it hurts my brain
why they dont buy a good striker and they keep nunez?
Imagine drawing to a team with around 1000x less money and resources than you 💀💀💀 Passion>>>>money
here we go again another year another fail. we beat big teams then lose to the dross. that was a really rubbish game from the so called super stars of liverpool. we will win nothing again this year. rubbish just rubbish.
Draw fully deserved, it is the best performance i have seen from luton this season, but fair play to luis Diaz for scoring such an amazing goal when having so much on your mind. It must be really tricky for him❤❤❤
Salah's miss before Nunez missed is just as bad. Free header from 4 yards out 😂😂😂.
Premier league is the best
As a Man United fan, I can't help but to think what a warrior Diaz is. I can only imagine the drama if any of our flaky united boys went through half of what he's been and still going through.
There are a few guarantees in life, death, taxes and Liverpool scoring very late goals.
How did they draw
Klopp should’ve played Salah today😂
And all I could think of is we got Liverpool next week 🤣
I'm confused with Liverpool's performance today it was like there was a spell put upon us where we couldn't put the ball in the back of the net
Fantastic, well played Luton
Prayers for Diaz’s dad to come back home safe
Bravo diaz
Diaz should have been given a yellow card
Luton is going good and that is where I live
Was going to suggest unlucky Luton but Liverpool should of been much better in front of goal.    Luton are defensively better than the teams below them, they can maybe take hope from that.  Barkley plays his usual good game against Liverpool, Luton need more of that.  Liverpool still a couple short but should still be happy with the start.  Got to get Mac Allister out that six position.   It had to be Diaz.
Diaz scores a leveller against Luton and sky sports makes the title seem like he won them the game…..Bruno scores a winning goal and Sky sports make title “United scrape a win” talk about agendas
Love Diaz and feel bad for him
Thought rob edwards was going Mourinho
Maybe now stop mentioning Nunez in the same breath as Haaland  The accusations are Haaland only scores tap ins which is far from the truth but I bet Nunez wishes he could do that. These two are so far apart is laughable
Welp irish guy wont be happy
padre...padre...lol
Well done Diaz, hopefully you and your family are gonna be better soon.
Another Liverpool game where the game continues until Liverpool score we haven’t seen that before have we
SOMETIMES NUNEZ MISSES GOALS LIKE HE IS PLAYING FOOTBALL FOR THE FIRST TIME AND SOMETIMES HE SCORES WORLD CLASS GOALS . NEEDS CONSISTENCY .
Did Nunez put on last season's boots or something?
I was shocked by the late goal
Goalkeeper in no man's land for the Diaz goal. If he's on his line that's into the keepers hands.
Who is number 8 for Liverpool? He should be playing for a pub team! Awful attitude
Nunez thinking he's playing Rugby again. Nothing like watching the Kopite shite get dominated by a newly promoted Champs team. Good job Luton.
Me as a big Liverpool fan can’t be made about the draw when Diaz scores the goal Luton played good to day and both teams deserved the point and hope that Diaz can see his father soon and for all of the fans we are with Diaz
When's Klopp going to read Darwin the riot act? That's too many unforgivable sitters he's missed. Super goal from Luton.
Diaz will hog the headlines but what a result for Luton
Libertad para tu papa Lucho. ♥️🇵🇹🇬🇧🇨🇴
Can't believe people were comparing Nunez with Haaland :X
Well done Diaz mate 👏  You are already a legend 🙌
Can't even beat Luton Town. 🤣
Looked like a pen for Liverpool from the corner before the equaliser
Respect to Diaz for everything he is going through 🙏🏽❤️
The Late Late Goal Show with Luis Diaz the parody name from The Late Late Show with James Corden.
Remember Liverpool fans laughing at Man Utd yesterday for ' scraping a win at Fulham '  yeah that aged well 😂😂 Lets all laugh at Liverpool hahahaha Title challengers hahahaa Klopp has had 8 years to build this team cant beat a team that consists of free agents and loan signings 😂😂😂😂
1.40: What a header!😆😆
Werner >>>> Nunez
Nunez finishing is something else
Nunez is so odd  Scores hard goals but misses the tap ins consistently
Why Nunez is still playing for Liverpool? Is Klopp blind? 🤬🤬🤬
I think everyone cheered along with that Luton goal. Shame it didn't last long but well deserved point!
Obviously respect to Díaz amidst all that’s happening, but liverpool are the biggest mood killers in prem history, genuinely the least fun team I’ve ever watched, absolutely nothing exciting happens
Perhaps Klopp would like a replay.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Liverpool in crisis.
Dippers cant beat the mighty loooton taaaan.
I'm sure football is scripted. Before the match someone posted "Diaz will come on and score the winner, you heard it here first". Well it was an equaliser. Close enough.
Serves them right for wearing silly shirts.
Today we got a draw liverpool still can compete for prem
Liverpool should of won
A long time ago, I lived on Darlow Rd. Will not have in 100 years imagined Luton in the Premier league let alone draw with mighty Liverpool. Well done Hatters you are starting to look like you belong in this league through some hard graft. Really hoping you defy the odds and stay up. That man Diaz has bags of courage. All the best from South Africa.
Liverpool should’ve won there.
Jammy scousies celebrating a point against Luton like a cup final win. Smalltime
2 points dropped by Luton
Why is it sky hates Luton ??? Were are a team trying to make it with no money … and doing the best we can …. Up the Luton … so proud of you lads
Liverpool fan usual bullshit falling apart already no where near Man City again
shocking from liverpool.
Scary how TTA can pass it on a six pence
If Diaz scored that goal... So did i.
Amazing result for Luton well Done.
Never gona win league if we cant win away at luton, so lacklustre
Happy for Diaz, cant imagine what he and his family have been going through.
Well paid Luton, unlucky not to grab a win, and love to Luis Diaz.
Happy for Diaz , but this has been our problem for several seasons now , breaking smaller teams who are well organised and play on the counter
Spurs only had 10 men and beat Luton???
Honestly pretty mad with the team over not being able to score against a relegation side, should've been an easy win, but Diaz scoring a last minute goal to get ANY result makes it worth it. YNWA Diaz.
West ham here diaz deserves that goal YNWA ❤❤❤
scoring a goal doesn’t save ur dad tho LOOOOOL get rekt
Luis should of replaced Darwin much earlier .
LUIS DIAZ WE ARE WITH YOU. YNWA
Should have started Diaz and Jota/Gakpo... let's call a spade a spade all you pro-Nunez fans he may have to be loaned out if he continues this performance!
Big up diaz! Good luck
Jota had those Nunez chances Liverpool 4-1 win today.  Get a proper striker trainer for him. Ex Prem striker perhaps
That away strip is awful
...and people dissed Spurs when Spurs beat Luton 1-0 at Lutons ground with 10 men.
Look at all these Liverpool fans in the comment section diverting to topic to Diaz's situation to cover the fact that they almost lost to relegation fodder. I've heard Liverpool will win the league...you have to beat Luton first😭 This season is just another walk in the park for City...the Prem is a farmer league...
How many more chances does Nunez want 🤔
Good Job, Luton Town!  I'm not a "fan" but impressed at how well y'all are learning, growing and playing. Don't get relegated and take this years experience your gaining and the next season, I can see you (Luton town) being a a good mid-table team.
Luton is getting a couple points now
Well done Luton
Liverpool are finished 😜 ( just jk don't take it personally)
Nunez is liverpools marial 😂😂
Liverpool were shocking today. Nunez is proving haters right. Arnold was poor as usual. Salah was shocking. Most of the team was crap tbh. Luton should've gotten the win
Nunez is too hit or miss
villa losing and liverpool being held to a draw… good weekend for us geordies
Nunez couldn’t hit a barn door
As a manunited fan I fell bad for Luis Diaz
Nunez need to relax…learn to finesse or caress his contacts.
So happy for Lucho .🙏..Hope his father gets released very soon ..🙏.Odd, how Hojlund puts his arm around a waist & it's a pen for cheaty ..Stones slings him to the ground in the box , not even a foul last week. Ball out ,foul & an offside for the Magpies goal & it gets given . vvd taken out completely today & nothing given ..All VAR decisions are made once oil bonds & shares are recieved at Stanley park ,to share out amongst the corrupt officials ....The league is an embarressment & Arteta got it spot on a disgrace . It gets worse week by week . How are they still employed . Eyes wide shut ? .🤷‍♀️..
My name is rach and Luton town is best team in the 🌎 world so good
Good result that as a Toon fan  Liverpool draw  Villa get beat  Toon army win!   Exciting the premier league with lots of twists and turns.  Air more to come for all teams. Hard hard league
❤ Nunez but he's got to be finishing these chances 😂
Is it me or has salah stopped taking people on? He always looks to pass now .....
Darwin 😂😂😂
That Nunez sitter is unforgivable, as soon as he missed you just knew Luton would go ahead.
That's 2 points that have got away from us. A game we needed to win.
We were lucky to come away with a draw. Terrible performance.
As a liverpool fan,I am absolutely gutted we drawed.I believe we could’ve got on top of arsenal to go third,but I’m happy for Luiz Diaz, that man will have a nice season I bet
Great match for Luton Town! I disagree with people saying Liverpool should have easily beat them. Luton Town is getting better that's why this happened!!
Moral of the story is when you want to handball , just look away and stick your hand out.
Well done luton, reality check
Klopp out
as a city fan i can only say 1 thing💀
Liverpool you are useless when it matters. Nunez wouldnt score in a brothel
well done diaz. Klopp does not play players in their right position that’s why everyone things mcalsitar is rubbish. Because klopp plays him in the wrong position. Probably why Jude did come. Also Jota is so crap.
Nunez is so so overrated
Luton deserved 3 points . Liverpool very poor and got away with a point. Sadly we are still miles behind City and Arsenal
From a United fan big respect for Diaz given his current situation. Noone should experience what he's had to.
Wanted Luton to hold on but when I saw that it was Luiz Diaz that scored I thought to myself God Bless Him.
Nunes is so bad 😂😂😂😂
god's
Loserpool~ Loserpool~ What a fun to watch Loserpool lose by a team that's lost by Spurs 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Happy for Diaz. Deserved point for Luton. Back to whiffing every opportunity for Nunes.
Why have they not shown the message on his shirt at the end?
As a Liverpool fan huge huge respect for Luton town what a performance they put up and they arguably deserved a win 😮🤯🎩🪄
No one deserves a goal more than Luis Diaz after what he's going through
ManyBlessings!
I now understand why there are so many fireworks going on around my house in Luton.
Nuiz hits the woodwork more than the net
As a fellow irish person, what a player ogbene is (no bias). He reminds me of a younger jeremy doku mixed with a young Eden Hazard. Hes got the pace of doku and the dribbling of hazard. Hope the best for diaz aswell, fair play to  the man, scored in one of the most difficult times and I hope they found his dad  But ogbene could be a generational talent if he moves to a bigger club, what a player he is.
Darwin Nuñez 🫣. How can a man be so GOOD yet so CRAP at the same time
It was lovely that Luton gave Liverpool a chance,  just for Diaz’s sake.
Bottlepool LOOOOOOOOL. Small club finds their level
Well done lads, a draw is better than to loose🎉 still on target🔥🔥🫶🏾🫶🏾👌🏾
Salah's header and Nunez's miss 😂
Even diazs father in Colombia would've scored more goals then Liverpool today
Darwin hasn't quite evolved yet
If only Luton could have held out for a few minutes more 😢  Imagine if they had held out for a famous win, especially with an ex Man United player who would have scored the winning goal.  Respect to Diaz for playing and scoring at the end, playing during his family issues is a good way to keep him distracted, and it is a brave decision to keep playing whilst the authorities keep looking for his father.  For those who think that he should be concentrated on finding his father and not playing at all, then please remember and respect that it is his own decision and his alone.  Everybody copes in different ways, so don't always expect others to do what you think or expect them to do and behave.
People
Hi
A point at Luton.😂
Absolutely disappointed Liverpool should be winning against Luton .
Why is klopp obessessed with the league cup playing a full team against bournemouth instead of resting the first team players was stupid i rather play the young fellows the fixture list is crowded enough .
What is that liverpool away kit
Diaz doing Nunez's job
1-1 Luton did well
Go on diaz crap game luton played well Nunez that miss lol YNWA
Liverpool's kit here is horrific 🤢
Up the Hatters!
Why dont Luton play like this every week?
Can somebody please tell me the difference between Hojlands grab of the city player last week where a pen was given and the grab on VVD is this game and nothing is given? EXACTLY THE SAME FOUL. 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🙄🙄🙄🙄
Good player and a real man👍👍
I feel really bad for Luton but I'm still happy for Diaz after what he's been thru and still managing to have the confidence to play and score is brilliant!
Salah didn't break Vardy's record 😢
kenilworth road has never been a place of comfort to liverpool
Luton were denied 3 points, Liverpool got lucky.
i feel sorry for Luton for taking that win away 😅
Nunez lol ynwa
The amount of “easy” goals that Nuñes misses is just incredible for a Premier league player who plays for Liverpool!
An incredible point. Well done Luton, keep on fighting.
Absolute joke.  A Liverpool teams who's been performing so well this season  and honestly tonight was shambles  I repeat ABSOLUTELY SHAMBLES THEY COULDN'T EVEN GET A SIMPLE PASS TOGETHER
Gracias Luis Diaz for the late equaliser! We are all behind you during this dark and difficult time! ❤
Embarrassing
What was on Diaz's t-shirt
ME as a liverpool fan  ITS A DISGRACE ITS A DISGRACE
Shout out to Diaz and his parents x
This was due to be one of the biggest shocks in Premier League history if not The biggest
Nunez isn’t good enough. Liverpool need to sell him and buy someone who can finish
ogbene is surprisingly a great player, remember a few years back i met him when he played for Limerick FC
luton got the dawg in them great point to build off!
Luton deserved it, such a shame they couldnt hold on, but fair play to diaz to come fetch one with everything going on.
Well played by luton - we should 100% have won this
The fact that Liverpool drew...
Fair play to Luton thought you played brilliant but next time leave the tragedy chants at home
Robbed of 3 points; 2 penalties not given, Luton handballs and fouls not given galore and the FA refs once again useless in their inconsistency
Wow well done to Liverpool for scoring in the closing seconds.  They need to buy better players . Man City are head and shoulders ahead of most teams in the Premier League as they have so many class players
COME ON LUTON COME ON LUTON
Liverpool
Diaz Diaz  Diaz  Diaz...
Diaz hop you find your dad😢
THANKS GOD LIVERPOOL CAME BACK FROM 1 DOWN
The celebration for Diaz was so nice! It made me cry!!! 😢
Get in two points dropped oh dear 😂
as a liverpool fan i got to respect lutons defending and goal keeping. this was one of those liverpool specials struggling agaimst a small club, people will blame nunez alone but thats not the case. i dont get how they critisise him and want him gone for missing chances then call him the goat when he score, salah is the best RW in the prem right now so why doesnt he score??. disappointing we didnt win but at least we got a point evetually thanks to our boi lucho, he needed that goal with whats going on. on to the next game
Classic Nunez. £65 million for that. Bigger flop than Andy Carroll
When Carra said “you can’t feel anything but absolute joy”… everyone except Liverpool fans disliked that
Proud of the lads, we nearly had Liverpool, we will get a win at Kenilworth Road very soon 😁
It’s all a show
That pass by Harvey Elliott though, Wow!
I feel so happy for Diaz scoring to make it 1/1 For the things he has been through We are with you Diaz😊
Not winning the league this year.
Nunez is a championship striker
Diaz is world class, him or gakpo have to start. N why not endo?  Rare management mistake today
a win, win. luton out of relegation, liverpool move up the table and luis diaz scores
Nunez must be related to timo werner
I always love it when pub sides come up against top teams and get a result against them, even if that means sneaking a point to tide them over. So happy that Liverpool could do all the pub sides around the country proud, it's just a shame that they had to stint Luton's title campaign by surviving their total domination and holding them to a draw.
When Spurs won with 10 men in Luton, football fans were mocking them that they barely won, they are bad and that the bubble was going to burst, blah blah.. but when it happens to liverpool, suddenly Luton are considered the masters of defending 😂
Darwin mayonnaise
This was always gonna go 1 of 2 ways, Liverpool would either play good and Thrash Luton, or play terrible and drop points.
What a performance from the hatters, Liverpool not clinical enough this match to end it quick but respect for Luton 👏
Darwizzy back at it again missing open nets 😂
Diaz 😢😢 that's truly outstanding para papa means for dad
Liverpool 2.0 first real test and it fails   The only way u get a 2.0 is a new manager the days of Klopp being a bench mark are gone
Fair play to Luton today. Really played their hearts out and utilised Kenilworth Road to maximise effect. Really hope they stay up as a team, just wish their fans were more respectful
We need to start diaz more, we need diaz on the left nunez striker and gakpo on the right wing, Salah just ain’t cutting it for us anymore.
What did diaz top say?
Klopp persisting with Macca as a 6 is why we keep conceding. Also taking off Jota & Dom instead of Nunez and Macca cost us 3 points.
Extremely pleased for Diaz, if he keeps this form up then I'll let his dad out my basement
Well at least we don't have to suffer Klopps teeth, 😂😂😂
Fair play Diaz. Hope your dad gets back safe. Núñez on the other hand… he’s absolute rubbish.
I bet Luton are gutted two dropped points 😏
Liverpool you had a chance to go 2nd and you blew it
Embarrassing stuff from Liverpool, they won’t win the PL playing muck like that.
This result along with Arsenal's, is exactly why city win the league again this season. Neither side have the strength in depth, or are consistent enough to beat City to the title. I said at the beginning of the season, it isn't a case of who is winning the league, it's just a case of how much City win it by. Is what it is.
I genuinely fancied Luton to win today. They've been competing well and Kenilworth Road won't be a walkover for opposition this season. Liverpool dominated territorial possession, but they didn't really create a lot bar Nunez fluffing a couple of chances. Luton sat in well and looked dangerous on the counterattack themselves, thought Ogbene had the beating of Trent all game who got physically dominated. Gutted they couldn't hang on!
Darwin Nunez 😂😂😂
Good game. Again we lack that finishing product. It’s crazy because we have goalscorers and natural ones at that. We are so strong, we just need to put these shots away. They make and break games and win and lose titles. Fine margins
Who on earth designed Liverpool's away kit? Jesus
Oh dear, oh dear. Liverpool needed special injury time to get an equaliser. That's what a Klopp rant gets ya.
Diaz brah ❤
Never forget, Nunez cost 100m😂😂😂
That’s 9 points that VAR has robbed from Liverpool this season.
Well done Diaz!
You Liverpool fans can’t back Nunez 😂😂
If nunez is missing some sitters but getting 2-3 goals a game you don’t mind, we can laugh it off. But you can’t do that and win titles, absolute bamford performance
Well done Diaz well deserved goal not a Liverpool fan but they deserved the win. Watch Chelsea suck Tommorow vs Tottenham
No words for Diaz today can’t imagine the week the guy has had he deserved that goal more than anyone in the world
Darwin "the goat" Nunez was Luton's best player today, he passed the ball back to their goalkeeper for them, cleared Salah's header right from underneath the net and even blocked Van Dijk's header which started Luton's counter-attack for their goal. He really is the gift that keeps on giving...
How Diaz can take to the pitch and play let alone score a goal to get his team a point is unreal, massive respect to that, klopp must have had a heart to heart with him , brilliant from a Newcastle fan 👏🏻
As a Newcastle fan, Must praise Diaz for scoring out of everyone considering the awful time he’s been going threw. Respect for Diaz. And Unlucky Luton , Very well played 👍🏼
Drew with the mighty Luton 😂
Imagine celebrating scoring against Luton 😂😂😂
crazy how it takes these little teams to play liverpool before they fight for everything. then play other big teams and just lay down.  i guess it tells us liverpool are the best of all time :)
Wish luton got the 3 points to get clear of bournemouth and the rest of the scrubs
What did I see luton was about to win against Liverpool
What is wrong with Nunez..... Never seen a more inconsistent player one week a wonder strike the next miss of the season. Great fun to watch as a neutral but would be very concerned if I was a Liverpool fan.
liverpool robbed.
And this is why Liverpool will not win the league with nunez being the main striker.  He's far too inconsistent and will.score a hat trick one week and miss 3 sitters the next. This should have been 2 or 3 for Liverpool
Not only is Diaz’ dad missing but Nunez also went missing 😭
Not a Liverpool fan but well pleased for Diaz. Stay strong!
What a shame LFC ... totally embar... salah schould be in championschip 3 years already
That has to be a penalty on Virg at 0-0. He gets rugby tackled.  And yet the haters will still have the audacity to say ‘LiVARpool’ next week just as they did in the game after spurs
liverpuddle🤣🤣
Luton will definitely stay up if they keep showing as much heart as they did today
Well done, Tahith. One for Curacao!
Is this their first meeting since that 3rd round FA Cup clash in 2006?
Díaz did a great header
How hard is must have been for Diaz. Fair play to him. Wishing him all the best
Nunez trying to take the leather off the ball all the time. He's such a hot head
Liverpool should request a replay
fair play to kamiski played brilliant
As a united fan class from Dias that after everything ❤️
Jammy cints !!!
Cos I'm Liverpool fc till I die its hetched  into my heart I no Liverpool inside out I've supported them since I was 11 and I'm 51 now no other team Liverpool fc
Dawizzy is back
Imagine drawing to luton
LiVARpool are a pub side and have finally found their level....
2 points dropped for Luton. Gotta be beating the likes of Liverpool at home
Luton deserved a point but surely that's a penalty?
We are with u diaz ❤❤
I'm sure Liverpool will win the replay.
Sala out of team completely, not 10 or 20 min Out
Ross Barkley was outstanding like prime Owen hargreaves today quality. Upmost respect to Diaz to even be able to play football at the minute never mind score a vital goal with what he’s going through!
Liverpool, embarrassment of the Premier League 😂😂😂
Cue angry Liverpool fans who blame VAR in some new way....
Only merseyside clubs can drop points to Luton 😂😂
Gone from Fergie time to Klopp time now
1. Made up for Diaz, such an emotional moment - hoping they release his rather soon.  2. Nuñez we love you but please please show some composure  3. Luton fans singing stuff like ‘feed the scousers’…you live in Luton
im done with the referees, robbing liverpool time and time again.
As a luton fan, I should be devastated with the equaliser. But much respect to Diaz, as well as that, what a ball from Elliot. Much love
Jamie would have lost his mind and Gary would have laughed if Liverpool lost to Luton of all clubs
This was rigged we should of won Liverpool that was a pen when vvD got pulled down🙄👎var is a descrass
Fair play to Luton but so happy for Diaz. Stay strong Lucho YNWA ❤️
Luton were excellent!
A close shave for Liverpool 😅 what a counter attack by Luton though good team goal that 👌👌👌
Still along way to go yet , let's see where the teams are after Christmas before making assumptions YNWA Diaz
Macallister and Nunez should be on the verge of being dropped from the starting line up, abysmal performances. Especially Alexis, how many times is he going to misplace passes? Diaz is the only play who should come off that pitch with his head held high.
All the praise will be about Diaz, and rightfully so, but huge credit to Luton. Coming from a Liverpool fan, you deserved to win the game. Thought we we're really off it today. Annoying but we take the point! 😩
Imagine drawing to Luton, how embarrassing can a team like loserpool get...
Liverpool Pants today kid
We need a striker KANE WOULD HAVE BEEN IDEAL NOW LOOK ELSEWHERE
Watch us United smash these luton town next week.
Embarrassing. Only getting a point against liverpool.
Luton fans threatening Diaz's life 😂 huffing and puffing at home sat in Stone Island attire 😅
After Diaz scored you can see Darwin Nunez kick the ball when it’s in the net and he nearly missed that as well look at his reaction 😂😂😂😂😭💀🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2 more points for varcity
More jam than Hartley's
Other teams have become stronger we 3 players short still
Can someone tell me why Liverpool got 8 minutes of stoppage time awarded? Seemed like overkill to me...
Drawing against Luton is crazy
That’s an absolute peach of a ball from Elliot
Absolutely unacceptable performance. Salah Nunez and Szobozlai all had shockers. Don’t understand why we lack attacking quality and pace in away games. Wish we played every game like we are at home. However Luton worked hard to be fair,. Well organised and difficult to break down. Got so many bodies in the way to frustrate us but Liverpool we’re still but good enough
Had to pause it at the start just to appreciate the stadium 😂
Mcallister was shocking today. Prob good news he is suspended for the next game..
Liverpool could have won this match if they’d picked Mo Salah. Luton deserved a point and maybe more, Hats off to them, I hope they stay up.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 unlucky Luton
Anyone know what the make of Rob Edwards' jacket is?
What was today a charity for the bottom half of the table! 😂
Come on Luton, probably only need 25 points to stay up, send Burnley down!!
Bob
My mates was telling me they're winning 10-0 and they had to wait for a last minute equaliser 😭
"Only luton" when we beat them with 10 men
Honestly I don’t get Nunez. Scores the hard ones and misses the easy.
FOUL ON VVD????/ CITY GOT THE SAME PEN YOU SHITS
Fair play Diaz deserved that goal
Freedom For Diaz's father
Some things are bigger then football…
Fair play to Luton 🎉
This is the most liverpool thing to do
So if rodri being pulled down was a pen why not vvd?
This is one of those results that absolutely no one thinks is going to happen going into the game. Fair play Luton lmao
Luton look the most likely of the promoted teams to stay up. And I never thought that would be the case, but what a spirited team they are
Huge point for Liverpool
Scoring a banger top bins vs Bournmouth away to come to Luton and miss an absolute sitter. Classic Nunez 😂
Liverpool were outplayed by Luton to get a draw😂😂😂
Luis Diaz was going to score 100% written in the stars
I don't support either team, but it's so depressing that Luton couldn't pull it off, would've been an iconic moment in the club's history! Good to see Diaz score though, with all the stuff going on with his parent at the moment
everyones saying what diaz has gone through.. could someone explain????
Good to see Nunez carrying on from where he left off last season Missing sitters 🤝 Nunez
Good for Diaz we are all with him
Lucho ❤❤ wow
Liverpool we’re robbed again we should of been awarded a penalty because of a handball
What a point, so gutting to concede last minute. Onwards and upwards COYH
Good result for Luton but that Diaz goal
Embarrassing from Liverpool.
Haaland subbed off, Watkins can't find the net and Salah doing nothing.  It's been a rough Gameweek for FPL fantasy.
Liverpool fan here, I can say this was a well deserved point for Luton. On the other hand I think we need to be more clinical at times, for me this has been the difference between us and city in the past years. Winning games like this is what wins you the title and we seem to lack that trait as a team
Diazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz love this guy man  I hope the best for his family
Luis Diaz to the rescue. To get on the pitch and do it under the circumstances nothing short of beautiful. Hopefully his father is also rescued safe and sound ❤️🙏
Lucho ❤
Liverpool fans gonna blame the refs but lets be honest the team played horribly.
Take a draw and move on. Not a great performance from Liverpool but at least we didn't lose the game
“FREEDOM FOR PAPA” football can be cruel but life can be crueler that Elliot cross could not have fallen to a more deserved player, the hero  ❤️
Nunez Being Nunez
Luton owns Merseyside
Delightful to see our former lad Chong score, especially against this lot. U have a real gem in ur hands Luton
How can Luton not hold a lead for just the last two minutes. Goodness me.
Agony for Luton! Perform like you did today every week and survival is a real prospect. Well done Hatters! 🎩⚽️👏
Should have been 8 nil to Liverpool
So happy for Luis diaz always working hard for the team and that celebration warmed my heart hopefully the police in colombia find his dad soon
i still can’t believe nunez scored thats worldie against bournemouth especially after dis game
Congrats to Luton how Liverpool struggling against a championship team 😂😂😂🤣😭
How the hell has Liverpool only managed a draw against a Championship side pretty much
Stay strong Luis 💪
Nunez masterclass
What a moment for Luis Diaz! With what he's been going through lately he had to save Liverpool tonight! Also a great point for Luton Town
Liverpool will be lucky to finish in the top 7
liVeRpOol aRe wInniNg tHe lEague😂😂
Diaz the GOAT
Love the supporter with the flag on the pitch!
Arsenal , Liverpool and Man United robbed by VAR. Premier league is finished.
I commented on the Forest Luton highlights saying Luton are not here to take part, they’re here to take over. I was laughed at. Nobody is laughing now.
A well deserved goal from Diaz. After all he’s been through and everything that’s been going on through his mind he still managed to equalise and help Liverpool. YNWA ❤️❤️
Great to see Nunez back on form again. We all MISSED seeing him at his best....
Yuuuppp 1st comment
Liverpool are lucky
Upset of the weekend ....Liverpool battling it out to gain an unexpected point at the mighty Luton
I can’t believe this
Sheesh
liverpool robbed should’ve been 2 penalties at the minimum
Couldn’t beat Luton what a shame
Great moment for Luis Díaz. Libertad para su papa. 🙏🙏🙏
Fair play to Luton, they defended fantastically. Best of luck for the rest of the season and I hope they can stay up
L
Good result for Luton !! Pity they didn't get the 3 points
me
😂 banter pool at it again ☠☠☠
We love diaz 😔🫶🏻
Fireworks on bonfire night cruel on luton close to famous win, if there was gonna be hero for lfc it couldn’t have gone to a better player
Liverpool are a weird team 😂
Luton put up a good fight unlucky they didn't win

Nunez is shite

Come on luis diaz
Justice for Diaz ❤
Diáz performing better than Antony while his father is kidnapped…
Respect to Diaz for scoring despite the dark things going on at the moment. We’re with you.

Hi
