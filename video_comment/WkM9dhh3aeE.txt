So, I looked it up because I was curious.  Ammonium Chloride is an odorless, white powder. Solid Ammonium Chloride is used to make dry batteries and Ammonia compounds, as a soldering flux, a pickling agent in Zinc coating and tinning, and a fertilizer. Ammonium Chloride fume, a finely divided particle dispersed in air, is produced in galvanizing operations.  That Supersalt Hockey Pulver… is basically just you eating dry batteries and fertilizer.
19:59 true trumpeter tonguing in effect 😂😂
Licorice
jesus its been so long since i saw markiplier that he looks off somehow, feels like this is another person
Rewatching because I can’t stop thinking about the fact it’s not a nipple, it’s a mushroom. Also in the U.K. they are strawberry flavour and they are delicious. That’s all. I can be happy now I finally explained.
31:40 Mark eats something poisonous.
Why are you looking at me like that, all I'm doing is eating an Almond Joy god dammit!! (34:00)
Turkisk peber... What you got in the center of it was salt.
I love it when mark does food or candy I just think he is a great food reviewer.
"Licorice inside"
0:06 i see johnny depp for a second there
Candy translations (only the ones I know are icelandic(  Jólaköttur-chrismas Cat Stjórnu rulla -star roll  Súper sett lakkrísbíttar- super sett licorice bits Opal sírónu og saltlakkrís-opal lemon and salt licorice  Risa þristur - xl three or big three Skóla krít - school chalk  😂😂😂 Lakkrísrór - licorice straw (mark you got that right)  That is all i recognized from where i live in Iceland  thank you so much markplier for making this video as an icelandic person i was very surprised to see one of the most famous youtubers making a video of Iceland like what?!?!? Iceland is a very unpopular land so thank you all for reading this list thanks goodbye
help me i'm stuck with mindiplier
The look of confusion 7:51
18:25, I thought he was hitting a vape. (I wasn’t looking at the screen)
8:34 Lithuania mention!!!!
Thanks!
the fact that mark doesn't like the powder inside the Turkisk Peber is atrocious. The powder is the best thing??????? Mark????? the salmiak powder is the BEST THING????? how can you not.. like it??????
3:22, I got Jack sparrow vibe from mark for a second 😂
1:58  bro saw mark on his schiznophrenic era 😭🙏
All the fazer candy are from Finland 🇫🇮  And some off the candy are Swedish 🇸🇪    It’s cool that you kind of like the taste of licorice👍🏼   Your brave to taste it all   The pink bubblegum is ok to eat when you open the lid it twists open but you can’t always here the sound! It’s really tasty! Just a reminder for the future 🤣😂
we have those melody candies here in australia! they are very tasty but i think just invented to annoy parents.
Dutch is not a nordic country, its danish
Can I exit your mind now
Mark that is indeed a sweedish flag
I totally thought that when mark was taking about the grandma candy he said "my grandma.......is Korean" i totally thought he would say "my grandma.......is dead"   (Sorry my dark humor took over)
At 14:30 it's basically the opposite of York candy apparently in my opinion
i just woke up in the middle of the night to mark playing that candy recorder full blast
i think the super salty thing that they couldnt handle was from denmark
Praying Markiplier decides to review British candy/sweets next.
secretly hoping he eats the salted licorice chocolate that looks like a normal chocolate bar if you can’t read the label
Bro the flute on the transition is so fire
We have those delicious maom round candy in Germany it's sooo good
Legendary video
0:01 Jacksepticeye intro sound effect
you should try Svensk jävlar
I just got my tongue pierced so I can't eat anything chewy or crunchy for a little bit until it heals up. Got this is making me crave candy so much watching this.
Captain Mark Sparrow isn't real, he can not hurt you
marks reaction to salmiak is the funniest fucking thing (as a dutch person i am all too familiar with salmiak and hate/love it)
I’m going back 😊 and eye  👁️ contact with you and your friends are the crack the time of
1:52 was scary help
19:54 okg img I remember these as a kid (I’m in the uk btw) 24:22 I eat these ALL THE TIME! One of my favourite sweets
In canada (or at least vancouver) the candy coated licorice is called school chalk
The second licorice and raspberry candy I always get from Germany just without the licorice and it is so good I be devouring them
As a Swedish person I was absolutely tweaking  right here.also Hello there.
distractible has fried my brain I entirely expected him to say "enter my mind" and end up in Guam
I just bought some of these. I only bought the ones he hated most because I’m curious. I mean, I’ve licked a switch cartridge and lived to tell the tale so how bad can it be? I will update when they arrive.  Edit: Alright… so, I can confirm that the Tyrkisk Peber things are good until you bite into it. It like… super charges the licorice flavor while also becoming salty, slightly spicy, and extremely chemically. The Opal things are a similar flavor to the middle of the Tyrkisk Peber. However, I must’ve gotten a different kind because it begins repulsive and becomes tolerable, apart from the fact that the texture is similar to eating hot glue that has set. Now… the Djöflar super salty stuff. It burned my lips with the titanic amount of saltiness, its also sweet which absolutely does my head in. How can it possibly be sweet and simultaneously the saltiest thing I’ve ever experienced. Anyway, it does taste vaguely like licorice while mostly tasting like you inhaled water through your nose. It sounds weird but I swear thats exactly what it tastes like. It tastes like I shouldn’t be eating it. Imma keep them around to occasionally give to my friends and family to try.
I got way too far into this video before thinking "I have misophonia, why the hell am I watching this?"
Is that from Mark's whistle candy?  I feel like I am remembering a Red Letter Media, Best of the Worst episode that had the exact same whistle tune but I can't remember specifically which one.
Mom ?
Iceland   Ireland  Island  Eye land  Septic eye land  Jacks set pic guy land
We need Mark to try Finnish candy/food next bc I think it'd be entertaining :D  Also side note, but there are two things that are both called 'Licorice' in English. One is what you're propably used to, the soft black pellet stuff (Lakritsi in Finnish). And one is -drumroll- Ammonium chloride! (Salmiakki in Finnish) It's much more... potent, i guess? Idk a good word for it :p It's harder and often sold as powder. The 'Hockey Pulver' candy in the video is pretty much pure.. that. I'm sad it doesn't have a word in English bc it's one of my favorite candies Side side note :p We made Salmiakki (Ammonium chloride) in chemistry class once and got to eat it :) And yes, it's okay and totally safe to eat though most Americans aren't used to the taste
4:40 "not my grandma, my grandma is green"
Why have I constantly been recommended this?
my ears are crying 19:09
Guys, the beginning was an Egde of Sleep reference.
I once gave a tyrkisk peber to a friend at school, saw him 10 minutes later, said he threw up in the bathroom because it was so horrible. At the time, I was disappointed they weren't as spicy as they used to be. Markiplier's reaction was everything I wanted muahahahaha
Holy crap that is the Swedish flag
We need the old intro back When he says “hello everyone my name is.. markiplier” very fast
Lixian...the sound was not necessary 34:45
the funniest thing to me was that mark struggled so much opening the bags because lots of american candy is just in a somewhat sealed cardboard box xD
Hockey pulver is an acquired taste..
Turkish Pepper is one of my favourite candies ;-;
"volcanoes dont exist" -future president of the US maybe
14:02  flash backs of the horrendous thing he did to the takis
bro looks like jack sparrow
I wanna see the haunted mask mark
Man, and here I thought we Dutch people had the closest relationship with everything-liquorish
Tubble Gum is like tongue colored xD
Ok I was loading up rdr2 while watching this and the Rockstar intro with the sawed off cut off the video at 25:31 so to me, it sounded like Mark killed someone for saying they like chocolate covered gummy bears.
Boat song reference eurovision
"This is Mark, Colonel do you read me?"
Mark: I'm more mature than I look  Google Feud: Mm... debatable.
I actually have family in Iceland
im now going to buy some turkish peber purely out of spite
43:40 is my favorite part
That candy was an a-salt on the taste buds.
47:50 lets go - lakrids by Bülow, danish candy, they have alot of different flavours, so its quite lucky he Got a flavour he actually liked (some of them are not that great tbh)
43:32 "but hey..." *say hats just a theory* "but hey..." *say thats just a theory* "but hey..." *SAY THATS JUST A THEORY* "that's just a theory" *YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES* -me
41:40 "esspapier" in german...the candy many of us rate 10...paper we can eat which even has flavor
Those who badmouth salt liquorice for its strength should not testify for it being bad, much like many who are incapable of handling high levels of spice. Why should people find it exciting to torture themselves with copious spice but not salt. Salt liquorice is granted far too poor a reputation and has essentially become a taboo even though like many foods it is an acquired taste. Honestly, how many of you had an instant liking toward blue cheese, Mustard or coffee, and yet all these are given a second chance. My current theory being the over dominant super sweet candy culture of the US of A, but I would love to hear theories as to otherwise.
Fun Fact; you're supposed to put Hockeypulver on something sweeter! Like ice cream, brownies, etc.
I eat Mints like candy
If you see the cat on the product it’s a real real brand Icelandic candy  🇦🇽🇨🇦❤ the cat is the brand name of the product. It’s one of the best brand in Iceland and there’s many others
How don't volcanoes exist? You were born near one!!
A candy whistle? That sounds interesting… especially if it can get a grown man to play it for like 30 seconds.
What about (vinatarta)
**Happy Amy Noises**
Norway,Sweden,Denmark,Iceland,and Finland Are The Nordic Countries!!🇳🇴 🇸🇪🇩🇰🇮🇸🇫🇮😎
It Punched Him In The Face So Much That He Said That It Pawnched Him In The Fass!!😂
🇮🇸<Iceland!!🇸🇪<Sweden!!👍
18:49 the dribble of drool omg😭😭😭😭
22:27 26:38 31:43
43:41 HE SAID THE THING
Salmiac (ammonium chloride) is the product of a reaction between hydrochloric acid and ammonia. It's a fun time.
im from poland i can confidently say that melody pops are from poland, or somewjhere close to it. And the maom swallable gum is a polish sweet aswell.
Someone needs to learn the guitar solos part from buddy holly by weeper on a melody pop.
MEOW
I can't believe Iceland stole the Toot Sweet idea from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
12:12 “probably the sweetest among all of them so far”  two seconds later: 12:17 “actually not even sweet at all” We love you Mark 😂😂😂😂
The reuse of the flute tones is genius
Its so funny watching non-licorice country people eat licorice 😂 I cant understand why its so harsh for them, when they can eat salt and spicy candy with ease.
34:40 is always comes like that.Its sugar that just feels like its close to being liquid. Way to sweet xD
For some reason "There is no such thing as volcanoes" mad me laugh stupidly loud
6:00  War thunder has taught me that that is in fact Sweden
Where is the puppy boo
Mark please we need more reviews they to funny 😂😂
31:31 i met icelandic people back in June and they gave me this and i hated it so much. it was like a powdered salt covered over black licourice. so bad
Tyrkisk Peber or Turkish Pepper is finnish, also the thing in the center is called salmiakki, which is licorice with ammonium chloride in it which is basically salt but with ammonia instead of sodium
does iceland have cats?🤣
All the actual iceland candy reminds me of httyd and what hiccup said "any food that grows here is tough and tasteless"
8:45 why you rate it the devil number man L Markiplier
Mark trying to read Nordic languages reminds me of simlish
It's always such a joy to see non-nordics discover "Salmiakk/Salmiakki" for the first time. It's very much a challenging flavor to get into, though. I grew up with it and quite like it, but most foreigneirs will have a dramatic reaction, good or poor, to it.
He never let me out I’m still stuck 1:00
As a proud Icelandic Viking I can say you gessed 50/50 on the Icelandic candy or not
The first candy bar looks like a 100 Grand.
3g er frá island's
4:40 that's Swedish candy, Sweden has the best candy in the world, no diff
Mark looks like a Korean Jack Sparrow with his headband
34:41 thats not how tub gum is supposed to look like🙏😭
That licorish is from gränna, witch is swedish
I had to look up ammonium chloride just for this. Apparently, it's also commonly used in a variety of thing s such as (if I'm not mistaken) fertilizer, soldering flux, and batteries.  In short, Mark's over here lick'n batteries as a profession.
Ironically, I put like 60 g of salt on a raw egg and ate it
hi markiplier
we have those gummy tube things in switzerland as well. I loved them as a child
I *HATE* licorice
What I learned from this video is that Icelandic people love licorice and salt, and Mark pulls off a headband astonishingly well.
The instant I saw a candy whistle I knew it would be a recurring part of the video.
20:05
bro bought so much swedish candy-
amy worried about volcanoes but its been plane crashes and greece having volanic activity lol
I wonder how many he got wrong
4:40 I was fully prepared for him to say “my grandma is DEAD” 💀
19:59 I got Miku vibes from that
Not a lot of icelandic candy there. The Swedish flag one goes in the icelandic pile 😂
Reykjavik: is known for having a lot of cats  Mark: 4:07
I wonder what his Icelandic fan base is like
01:01 Domain expansion,Infinite void🤣
I miss this kind of videos
Markiplier: I try to only eat foods I trust. Also Markiplier: So I left some meatloaf on a plate in the fridge uncovered for a week and thought if I microwave it enough, it would kill the mold I saw growing on it.  ... It did not in fact kill the toxins.
Who is Spencer, the new black pupper?????
So I’m British so most of these I haven’t had. But god those melody lollipops brings back memories of childhood. Specifically me and my brother playing ours as loud as possible in the backseat of the car and getting told off. 😂
I miss the "review era" of videos tbh
Trick or treating in Iceland must be interesting 😅
Holy Macoroni
Spencer 🤭
Where is the páska egg?!?.... páska eggs are Icelandic easter eggs (hollow chocolate with lots of candy inside and a little fortune). These brought so much happiness to my childhood.
Non-alcoholic isn't totally alcohol free. Look for the beers that say alcohol free or 0%.
I remember the whistle lollipop from when I was a kid! I could never get mine to make any sound, but they were delicious. I'd forgotten about them until I saw one in this video.
Gränna candy exists in iceland???
just watched a few other videos of tubble gum, i think it just doesnt have a safety seal. the french are risk takers is see XD
I love nerds gummy clusters!
my friend recently sent me some candy from overseas (they live in Sweden) and I will agree that the tyrkisk pebers were so yummy until i got to the middle part and got jumpscared
38:27 😊funniest line though outthe whole video 😂
"theres no such thing as volcanoes" really saved the volcano thing
I wonder if Mark is going to make more of a review video today
Mark but as a candy-shoveling pirate
Mint in chocolate: the Devil's work (evil) Chocolate in mint: York Peppermint Patty (good)  This is what I have learned today
28:49 :)
if i have to be trapped in your mind, Mark, my cat comes too. I need my cat, and so does your mind.
21:40 I felt seen 🤗✨
as a swedish person the second candy roughly says "very great candy from gränna" which is not grandma its a place in sweden..
It will eat your soul 7:07
MARKIPLIER PLEASE WATCH 41:08 AND SEE YOUR FUNNY DOGS PLAYING
26:35 I want you to only read the subtitles together
Living in america i feel like im at constant war with my blood sugar.. i dont even have diabetes, but i eat the wrong thing and im essentially worthless falling asleep standing strait up.
Im coming from Sweden and we eat that all the time cause we want salt
im icelandic 🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸
in fact turkish pepper is not from iceland
The incredibly salty one, as well as the one called «skole kritt» and the «tyrkisk peber» are all candies i grew up with, which makes his Reaction to them all even funnier to me.
I would love to see Mark do a bunch of Hot Sauce reviews
As soon as he mentioned the salmiak i KNEW what the reaction was gonna be 😂. I’m from the Netherlands originally (US citizen since ‘18) and i do love licorice but i really don’t like any salmiak ones. Just nope
18:50 🎶A mouth full of cheer!  A sweet without peer!  A musical morsel supreme!  Toot sweets! Toot sweets! The candies you whistle, the whistles you eat! Toot sweets! Toot sweets! The eatable tweetable treats!🎶
i like how all he yaps abt it licorish
24:32 where I left off
dose anyone know what the jacket he has is called
Love how he admits to eating an unhealthy amount of salt while being traumatized by salty candy
It’s old video but it’s called “Chalk”
"I have good news it is not blue licorice" *chews and crunches with instant regret* "I have bad news it is full of the same thing that that one was" 🤣😂😂
Ther ar cats in iceland
I played is if from iceland or not whilst watching 1 3 5 12 13 15 17 18 21 are from iceland  2 is swedish 4 is british 6 norwegian 7 norwegian 8 uk 9 swedish 10 norwegian 11 i didnt know 14 i didnt know 16 i didnt know 19 norway 20 usa 22 germany
Okay so I translated "Tyrkisk peber''.....yeah Mark that's probably not Liquorice, it's actually Danish and it's called in English "Turkish Pepper", that's why it looks Hot candy! 🔥 🥵
WHY WAS I EATING A TWIX BAR WHEN HE SAID THAT
the gel l;ike gum looks like denture cream
Danish word: pulver = powder ,tyrkisk= German
A lot of times, whenever I “watch” YouTube videos, I turn autoplay on and use it as background noise for something else. I have no idea why, but YouTube recommendations ALWAYS plays this exact video at least once or twice a month. For some reason, I can’t bring myself to choose a different video, and I enjoy it more every time. I swear Mark used some sort of hypnosis or subliminal message in that little slide whistle jingle.
I smiled for every single whistle transition
"Hjärtligt Gott från Gränna" Means Heartedly/jolly good/tasty from Gränna (a place in SWEDEN. Kinda hard to translate ngl, we use wierd words in Sweden lol.
Ammonium Chloride is the salt of Ammonium Hydroxide when reacted with hydrochloric acid. Since ammonium chloride in this way is the salt of a weak base, this means that the resulting pH would end up being acidic. Maybe the acidity of the salt had something to do with the taste?
*TOOT! SWEET!*   *TOOT! SWEET!*   *THE CANDY YOU WHISTLE!*  *THE WHISTLE YOU EAT!*   *TOOT! SWEET!*   *TOOT! SWEET!*   *THE EATABLE TWEETABLE SWEET!*   If you get that reference, we can be friends.
Jólaköttur is Christmas cat in Iceland
Love Lixian but hear me out if you remove Lixian from the videos and it being like those Garfield comics of John looking insane because he is talking to himself would be funnier
fazeeer!!! TORILLA TAVATAAN!!
No this wont look good 💀 the liquorice is going to kill him
a wild markiplier roar in its natural habitat 6:34
we really need mot candy jingle in future videos
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS VOLCANOES
Amy cam is the best cam!
the pinballs ones are all around the uk theyre like always in corner shops they are so good tbh
I recently had swedish sweet and sour candy and was very surprised it was like hybrids of candy you get here
3:33 I’m just enjoying that he’s looking like a modern day pirate from Pirates of the Caribbean
28:42 Danish Packaging at it's finest
I couldn't focus on the video because Mark looks like Jack Sparrow with the headband. (Plus he has a jar of "dirt" at the end)
next england
there are cats in iceland
Wait a popular YouTuber talking something about a small country that I live in.            *sniff*
Nah the zooming in is just next level lmao
I love licorice! I should go there someday. Unfortunately my kids and wife all dont like licorice that much.
"Candy from grandma" "probably authentic" has a swedish flag on the bag  Nice job Mark 😂🤦‍♂
Bro ammonium chloride is used to make dry batteries, used as a soldering flux etc, why the actual F is that in candy 😭it's a hydrogen chloride-which is used for electroplating, cleaning n stuff. What on earth 😂
I can’t believe it finally another food review.
The candy whistle after reviewing each Icelandic candy is like a liquorice twist. A delightful finishing touch!
I wonder what the volcano was going to lead to
I meant it is licorice
It doesn't s Licorice
Actually personally as á icelandic person there’s way to many cats hear
Peber
I know what that is..
Did you know that Iceland is made out of Lava, that's true.Iceland is made of lava
5:58 it was at thhis moment mark knew  he fukt up
4:41 nor my grandma... one's dead, and one's brain is only semi working.
31:19 best part
I am worried and I want to escape this place
Those ufo sherbet things just took me back to my childhood
I keep comming back to this vid when im having a bad day. Not because its comforting. But its so funny watching him pronounce basically everything in such an American way
I'm from the UK and Ive never seen sneaky bubble dust in my life and very much doubt it'd be legal to even sell here as it'd be a choking hazard for kids, most likely its i biproduct for bubble lgum they sell here like you said but they cant sell the 'dust' here so they only sell it overseas
Last time I went to Denmark we were looking everywhere for some hard boiled sweets for the plain home (to stop our ears popping) and ALL we could find was liquorice! We like liquorice in the UK but the scandinavians must be absolutely crazy about it
5:52 Yeah! Thats my country baby!
*Björk has entered the chat*
18:19 this was the best musical performance ever, standing ovation and entrance to the world candy whistling hall of fame, effective immediately.
Isnt Ammonium Chloride used in like solder flux and shit?
The video starts here: 2:50
44:25 :>
Ammonium chloride is the "salmiak" flavor that a lot of scandinavian liqourice candy have. Its what gives candy the kinda salty liqourice flavor. So hockey powder is essentially just flavoring for you to snort raw.
Me thinking he was trying to pronounce some icelandish word I didn't know only for him to turn the bag around and show "Hjärtligt Gott från Gränna" was an anime top 10 plot twist moment I didnt expect
wow, there's quite a few Swedish (a few Nordic countries rlly XD) candies in this video, I figured he'd end up with a few but still XD oh and of course the Tyrkisk Peber (pretty sure it's Danish, Turkish Pepper)
31:42 I was not ready for this reaction
Goður
Takk fyrir að broða namið okkar
As a Finn who also hates Tyrkisk Peber, I am deeply offended by Mark's reaction😂
Dude looks like a freakin rock star
wuuut how do u not like tyrkisk peper its da shit
I'm islandik
SVAMPAR I LOVE THOSE
Who’s the third dog?
Message for anyone not Scandinavian:  Salmiac is the single best culinary invention since meat curing. If you’re coming here, you’ll find this glorious substance in damn near every candy. Learn to like it.
Fun Fact: Speaking of leftovers of candies, Nerds were created from the leftover crumbs of the Everlasting Gobstoppers.
Ye the gränna candy is swedish and i can confirm as i an a sweed tyvm and also That chewing gum in the tube is supposed too be like that, fun fact the blue version is my fav chewing gum
I just tried the slide whistle pop the other day the exact flavor too
HELL YEAH, BULBOUS NODULES!!!
Maoams are German. Manufactured by Haribo. Very popular in the UK. Very tasty.
So you eat gym??  Isn’t that not good at all Markiplar??😅
no one will ever know what marks volcano thing was
dam it mark i come to watch YouTube to (sleep) and you pop up ok hes chill ... then i spend until 9pm the next day watching you    no one on youtube fits the category of chill       yall goanna think what about coreyx  he's just goofy in a good way mark keep posting i will eventually sleep ... eventually
Now review Hungarian food
They were literally eating battery acid   (from internet): Solid Ammonium Chloride is used to make dry batteries
10:30 RIP misophonia havers
No words can describe how hungry this video made me, I’m full, but I really want chocolate now.
Try “svensk jävlar”, you just need to see it to understand how salty it is lol
That one you thought was from Sweden was from Sweden but no one eats it :/
11:28 rule with icelandic candy: if it has an english name, it’s not icelandic
Jölakötyur is the christmas cat and in old icelandic folklore the cat used to eat children if they didnt behave. So yes jólaköttur is Icelandic and yes cats exist in iceland you just came at the coldest possible time
Today I learned Icelandic people REALLY like their licorice
I like candy!
I am sorry to inform you that after my trip to Iceland, TYRKISK PEBER is infact Icelandic.               yeah yeah call me a nerd
One of the best intros of all time
why do they have so much disgusting black licorice? and why do they always pair it with pink? Nasty. that's not candy that's just gross. But I loved your trying of it all :D
Petition to have Mark's Whistle Jingle in every food review from now on
I think Icelandic people like licorice 😂
Alternate title: mark bites into mystery candy, begging it isn't licorice, but it's all licorice.
It’s sad not hearing him mention Denmark a single time considering how much of that is danish
Hockeypulver and Tyrkisk Pebbar are amazing. Licorice is the best.
Mark casually freakin DYING on 75% of this candy: mmm c... Candy coated l... Li... Licorice~ *ugh*!
That whistle transition is hilarious...
IS THAT CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW
you will get that sponsorship one day...
Am I the only one who thinks he looks like John wick
I'm high and this really does feel like a fever dream 😆
I am from Portugal and I used to have those whistle candy as a child :O
Tyrkisk Peber and Hockey Pulver are like my favorite things! It was funny seeing Mark dislike them hahah
When is he doing Polish foods or something??? (I’m Polish 💅)
Mark: BUT THATS JUST A THEORY… A GAME THEORY! Mat watching this: ITS NOT A THEORY!!!!😡
Why do you sound like you are trying to do a spell.
33:13 "EHHEE"😂
I really wish mark had him put in the jingle out of context first
can't wait for a video where Mark review portuguese's candy with Lixian
4:59 has the same vibes as that one video of brittany broski drinking kombucha
I LOVE MARKI REVIEWWWWS
icelander
Tyrkisk peber is full of ammonium chloride as well
43:29
31:34
28:45
2:30
0:07
He looks like jack sparrow to me for some reason 😂
Isn't that first one just a Lion but with a different name? 😅
Im gonna guess the flame candies werent supposed to be hot, they were made with volcanic ash in the middle
6:47 it sounds like a spell
16:45 , 32:00 seeing markiplier trying to comprehend salmiakki is funny
The second one is Swedish, from a town named Gränna (I LOVE POLKAPRINSEN)
Can you please review portoguese candy?
I was dying over Mark's reaction to the devil candy. He looked like he was holding on for dear life.
🍒3:05 (Christmas cat/the Jule cat) *icelandic* 🍒4:09 (yes most of them are in the neighbourhoods at the school yards or inside) 🍒4:42 (thats Swedish..)(these are actually so good) *not icelandic* 🍒6:47 (very hard to explain this one but it is Icelandic I’m pretty sure) *icelandic* 🍒6:54 (some *Icelandic* slang that only 25 year old women or older say to sound cool but it basically means really tasty or sum) two sectioned fruit gummies) 🍒9:03 (that does not look Icelandic at all bc I know they would either name it something in Icelandic or something that doesn’t really make sense in English) *not Icelandic* 🍒11:35 (star roll ) *icelandic* (hate the middle thing) 🍒13:31 (ermm it’s *not icelandic* I think because I’ve never seen it and chocolad is not Icelandic) 🍒15:10 (SPICYY) *not icelandic* 🍒16:32 (yeah that’s inside most spicy things it’s like some pepper powder or something like if you open one you’ll see light brown powder) 🍒18:05 (bro it’s chupa chups ofc it’s *not Icelandic* ) 🍒20:22 (that’s also Swedish and very good) *not Icelandic* (grew up with these tho) 🍒21:56 (NEVER SEEN THAT..) *think it’s not icelandic* 🍒22:56 (socker means sugar in Norwegian or sum) 🍒23:28 (does not look Icelandic bc this is more creative) *not icelandic* 24:38 (super set liquorice bites) *icelandic* (actually really good) 25:58 (opal lemon and salt liquorice flavour sugar free) *icelandic*  🍒28:31 (yes just mint) *not icelandic* 🍒 31:16 (devils..) *icelandic* (I hate these and whets inside is very similar to what was inside those “spicy” things) 🍒 33:53(gum) *not icelandic* 🍒 35:24 (**big** third or whatever very hard to translate) *icelandic* (luv these) 🍒36:28 (good) 36:55 *not icelandic* 🍒 37:52 (flavoured) *not icelandic* 🍒 40:23 (HATE THESE) *not icelandic* (there’s black sugar inside) 🍒 42:09 (liquorice) *icelandic* (I did not know it was used for drinking)(it’s hard bc the drink was cold) 🍒 45:40 (I HATE THESE EWW THEY MADE ME PUKE WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND THE POWDER OUTSIDE OF IT IS THE SAME THING AS WAS IN THE “HOT” CANDY) *both* *MY PHONE IS LAGGING SO MUCH*
Idk if they have these outside of New Zealand but every week when I go down to the store to buy snacks for the weekend I get a bag of "RJ's licorice chocolate twists" which is just black licorice twists with a line of chocolate through the middle and they're very good
It would be hilarious to see mark try Portuguese candy and have Lucian edit it… I think they would get very defensive lol
It's ammonia, not ammonium. As an element. In molecules, it's ammonium (element)
W
Asian John wick tries Icelandic candy
I went to Iceland on a college trip first thing I picked out was the candy that's black with the flame. The rest of the trip was getting people to eat them and Watching the reaction. It's like licorice but also cinnamon it's bad.
Damn I would've loved to meet you when you visited, but hey maybe next time you visit I can say hi!
Captain jack sparrow?
That is, in fact, the Swedesh flag
Just for a bit of context, the liquorice straws were made when all soda (especially Appelsín, an orange soda) was in glass bottles, the straws were a fun way to make it easier to drink out of it and having an edible straw afterwards
The straw didn’t had any flavor because even the freaking beer was made of damn licorice
Jólaköttur - Icelandic Raspberry/Liquorish bonbon - Swedish Trítlar - Icelandic Jerry Can Gum - British Stjörnurúlla - Icelandic Peppermint/Chocolate bonbons - Swedish Tyrkisk Pebber - Finnish Chupa Chups Whistle - Spanish Raspberry/Liquorish nipple - Swedish Hockey Pulver - Swedish MAOAM - German Súper Sett - Icelandic Opal - Icelandic Mint bonbons - Swedish Djöflar - Icelanduc Liquid gum - French Þristur - Icelandic Skole kridt - Finnish Tyrkisk Pebber (sour)  - Finnish Frisia - Belgian Lakkrísrör - Icelandic Lakrids by Bülow - Danish
15:31 goddamn Lixian, props for the sick editing. He even got the reflection of the flame in the countertop
you can melt the turkisk peber candies in vodka and you get fun candy shots from it :P
“your special and I love you” *DOODLEY DO DO DO DO* 21:44
Captain Mark Sparrow
being Finnish this was fascinating to see how many candies overlap between us and Iceland. that whistle thing was my favorite candy as a kid cause i could annoy the shit out of everyone with it lol
Fazer is a finnish bakery company And ammonium chloride is a main ingredient in liquorice.
Takk fyrir frábært myndband! 🇮🇸
Is it just me or in those close ups at the beginning?Did mark kind of look like Jack?Sparrow or johnny depp just for a second
gonna be honest as someone whos nordic, the reds in nordic candy are always the worst. green, yellow and orange >>
I see cats everywhere I go mate
Mark obviously hating the hockey pulver and immediately offering some to Amy is the most mark thing ever.
my least favorite thing abt food is when something is supposed to be “spicy” but they forget the flavor and it just tastes like battery acid. america has a very bad habit of making spicy stuff a challenge and not actually a thing to be eaten.
“I have good news” immediately “I have bad news”
22:11 should've snorted it
He can get into squid game w this kinda staring  30:50
I like to think that right after this Mark threw eggs at Ethan
Weirdly enough the “sour” trítlar gummies are sweeter than the normal ones so I can’t even blame him for being surprised
Bro became food thirie
17:51 danish
Has a Swedish flag on it, must be Icelandic.
-saving you the google- ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) is an ionic acid (mildly acidic) that, when aqueous (aq), will conduct electricity and "quench" reacting mixtures. side effects of consuming NH4Cl are "pallor, sweating, irregular breathing, bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, local and general twitching, tonic convulsions and coma." (so pretty bad stuff) ALSO "ingestions can cause serious injury to the gastrointestinal tract and pulmonary systems." (and he wonders why he goes to the hospital so much) little fun side-note : the excess of ammonium from consuming NH4Cl can cause interruptions in the TCA cycles of brain cells-- therefore less ATP in the cells (which means there's less energy to go through glycolysis, CAC, ETC, etc and create energy) which will make you sleepy.  have fun with your ammonium chloride bud
Hjärtligt gott från Gränna (second candy) is Swedish. Both written in Swedish and has the swedish flag on the front XD  Hockey Pulver is also Swedish. Pulver means powder and the ingredient "socker" is just swedish for sugar.
Appelsín + Lakkrísrör = Æðislegt
It’s 4am rn and I’m watching this - I think I’m doing life right 😎😭
that nose hair at 1:45 deserves highlights, Lixian XD
Why is mark being Jack Sparrow
18:28 I love how the song got better over time
watching this after a volcano just erupted
The third candy almost looks like Jelly Babies
I love the gum powder. I’m from USA and I love it, had it as a kid in the states
This video is sponsored by [ It wasn’t :/]
Honestly, from 38:20 - 38:50, it makes me laugh so hard and I've rewound it 14 times just for that I also feel it is relatable to life somehow
Biker Mark is looking pretty studly just saying.
Man, Mark, you got so unlucky with picking so much liquorice and salmiakki (salty liquorice) XD  Yeah, Tyrkisk Peber isn't hot like spicy. It's not hot by temperature or sexiness either. It's, like, a fourth kind of intensity. And don't worry, those especially are an aquired taste. They might be super popular, but not everybody likes them, and not all the time.
I love that half of the candy is from Sweden
The whistle candy beat that he made is so fire that it should be in all his videos 😭😭😭😭
45:10 until 45:31 IM LAUGHING SO HARD, oh lord, the soundeffects, loved it
4:08 Yes, Iceland do have cats, you can look it up.
If I’ve learned anything from this video it’s that Icelandic/Nordic candy is NOT for the hypertensive 😂
YEEEEEESSSSSSSSS ICELANDDDDD i didn't even know they had christmas cat candy
this is my favourite series
I knew I wasn't the only one to lick salt off my palm
You should try Mexican candies, but don’t get too many with chili powder.
I appreciate how Lixian cut off where Chika’s legs would be so our minds wouldn’t be destroyed watching her hover above the ground
MARK TALK ABOUT PALESTINE MARK TALK ABOUT PALESTINE MARK TALK ABOUT PALESTINE MARK TALK ABOUT PALESTINE MARK TALK ABOUT PALESTINE MARK TALK ABOUT PALESTINE MARK TALK ABOUT PALESTINE MARK TALK ABOUT PALESTINE MARK TALK ABOUT PALESTINE
Lixian slaying as always
Mark Should do a video where he reviews Dutch candy (BUT IT'S JUST ZOUTE DROP'S)
seeing mark chew on salmiakki was not on my bingo card but definitively hilarious to see him eat turkish peppers
16:56 imagine if he said "it tasted like you" 💀
Markiplier: trys the djoflar candy   ...WTF!!🤔  ME: dies on the floor laughing from the faces he makes 😂😂😂😂 31:53
Give an ADHD kid a noisy toy they can also snack on? 10/10. I would also love a melody pop.
Mark isn't reading labels , he is summoning eldritch gods XD
Mark saying "there's no cats in Iceland" so confidently is so funny to me considering they literally walk freely in cities, I googled a number and I'm seeing estimated more than 20,000😂
I actually really want to know what jacket Mark is wearing.
THEY'RE MUSHROOMS NOT NIPPLES
when finnish candy?
Ive been gone a while, does he have braces on his teeth suddenly?
With the full realization that I'm 3 months late to this party....The degree of saltiness decreases in the following order: ammonium (most salty), potassium, calcium, sodium, lithium, & magnesium salts (least salty). 😁
HE’S BACK REVIEWING THINGS!!1!1!!
39:48 “It’s Iceland…. Next! :D” this man is too precious
is mark baby maverik????
The gum toothpaste supposed to be like that the top part is just sugar it was fine its actually not icelandic but i love it its my favorite gum from my childhood and thats cuz the flavor lasts longer then other gums rlly sweet u missed out
the facial expressions you make in this video are SO funny. putting the closeup cam THAT CLOSE was a VERY good idea X'D
is it just me or at 35:30 he kinda sounds like dio :>
it was able to PUNCH me in the fat heaaa FACE... punch me in the face with flavor xDD. I know Mark, I know. You don't have a fat head hah xDDD
The melody pop is even in italy and theres supposted to have a song inside the plastic
'American food safety standards' is a funny sentence
Chinese candy time LOL
The catt is.a crismas can from iclAnd
21:38 Thanks, I guess
the bubble dust is a poor imitation of a discontinued gum called Bubble Jug. it slapped and was very popular with kids in the 90s, and came in the exact same jug. it had actual nuggets of gum, not just dust, and they were delicious
Low key the whistle that lixian tunes up sounds like the one in Squid Game 🤔
1:58
Það eru engir kettir á Íslandi var fyndið
That gum looked like the slime from Ghostbusters 2
WE HAVE TONS OF CATS ON ICELAND!1!1!
I just searched this online and a small jar of the chocolate coated licorice balls with shipping will set me back a little over $90 AUD here in Australia. Ha ha no thanks even if Mark says it's good I won't be buying it. Sorry not sorry.
The fact that half the stuff he tried was either Swedish or Finnish is hilarious, can’t blame him tho since he can’t read it😂
LMAOOO I lost it when Mark literally blew up the gummies packet
sorry but after plane I thought towers rip no disrespect
very informative. very iceland
I like Mark's headband thing, idk what it would officially be called.
As an Icelander this is hilarious. And the ones he liked least i love, except he tried the wrong Opal (yellow and black package is nasty) Btw Djöflar are great. Way too salty, dangerously so. But so good
Russian candy next? 👀
The jingle is cracking me up 😂
I had to put on earbuds for this video because, every time Mark tried to pronounce the words on the packages my furniture kept assembling and disassembling itself.
Mark:👹you will never escape👹 Me:k idc
The first candy is Icelandic candy I like it🎉
I live in Iceland. It’s a very good land.
Imagine if he did British sweets I'd eat the exact same ones as him  for the rest of my life 😍😍😍
My misphonia went OFF when Mark started playing the whistle candy 😭
GOOD PUPPERS 💛💛💛
Ironically shortly after this video, a volcano happened in Iceland 💀
Its assault 33:31
,, it's liquorice
I can tell which candy that I know is Icelandic that you tried in order since I live in Iceland: 1. Icelandic 2. Not Icelandic 3. Icelandic 4. Not Icelandic 5. Icelandic 6. Not sure 7. Not Icelandic 8. Not Icelandic 9. Not Icelandic 10. Not sure 11. Not Icelandic 12. Icelandic 13. Icelandic 14. Icelandic 15. Icelandic 16. Not Icelandic 17. Icelandic 18. Not Icelandic 19. Not Icelandic 20. Not Icelandic 21. Icelandic 22. Not Icelandic (it's Danish)
41:15 Nice break!
I know what it is - liquoirice
27:49 That's so offensive! 😂😂
What happens with the rest of the candy?
21:48 Ooooh that's so Sweet!!!!
6666666 the sign of the devil
Don’t👏make👏candy👏spicy. Pls it taste nasty.
Yes that is the Swedish flag. 🇸🇪
Where are they? That place looks gorgeous!
i have to make a presentation about iceland
There are cats in Iceland and jólaköttur(yula cat) was Icelandic
First time I have ever watched or seen this gentleman
NO THAT IS NOT SOLID SNAKE, STOP INPERSONATING HIM
salted licorice
why does he remind me of brittney broski making those faces after the second candy 😂
when he asked us what we thought that was, I originally thought human flesh.
socker is suger in Swedish and almost all of the candy is Swedish
The 2nd candy is my favourite❤😢
Mark the cat on the first candy package is the santa cat and it belongs to santas mom grýla and the cat eats children and we do have cats in iceland
OMGGG MARKIPLIER IVE BEEN SUCH A FAN SINCE 2015 AND IM ICELANDIC😭😭❤LOVE YOU
The first candy looked like shit that has corn in it---😭✋ 3:06
The "unidentifiable" taste, in the hockey powder, and inside the Finnish Tyrkisk Peber candies, is called salmiakki. Very popular here in Finland, can be found in so many different kinds of forms, not just candy. Many of us grew up with those candies, and I guess it's an acquired taste. Also basically a chemical, many of us millennials made edible salmiakki powder in chemistry class as teenagers. 😄
The way they kept redoing the intro cracked me tf up 🤣
Mark actually eating stuff and not just sucking on it or swallowing it whole? What happened? Who changed him?
As an '80s kid, I Loved the Whistle pops! They were so common to find in stores back in the day. Now I' ve only seen them on Amazon these days.
0:11 building 🏢
So what do we take away from this vid? Stay away from anything tyrkisk peber
Probably salt lol and btw ammonium chloride is used as a flavoring in licorice
Can you do the Netherlands 🇳🇱
So funny and sad that Mark went to Iceland like two weeks after my wife and I were there over New years.
0:36 Ruh roh
Lmaoooo "hjärtligt gott från Gränna" just says "heartily good from Gränna". Gränna is a Swedish city known for their hard candy. The "nipples" (actually mushrooms) are from the same company lol. (Also, raspberry and liquorice is a pretty common flavour around these parts of the world. Not that odd tbh, and it makes sense that us Nordic countries share tastes like that.)  Funny that most of the actually Icelandic stuff ended up in the "not Icelandic" pile while the generic Nordic (mainly Swedish and Finnish) candy was deemed Icelandic lol.
Mark. You should try Polish Candy!
Try swedish candy it will change your life
As an icelandic person, i saw this video and i got all giddy. Thats all i needed to say,
31:44\I almost peed myself at this time because he sound like Donald duck😂
man mark has a way with words
Amy makes every video a million times better
The second one was Swedish with the Swedish flag
The chocolate peppermint candy exist even on argentina, but i would assume our version is more soft that the icelandic one
First is icelandic Second candy is swedish :)😊 third icelandic. Fourth... no. fifth icelandic
Loved this video! ☺️❤️ Always love when you do the review stuff. And I loved the little “noise noise noise“ cameo, from Ethan 😂😊
Imagine pewdiepie sees this video and also sees the Sweden flag on that candy...
mark looks like  jack sparrow with that bandana
Maoam is a German Candy btw
The second candy is from Sweden and it says on the front "Very yummy from Gränna" and Gränna is a town in Sweden that is famous for making this sort of hard candy/candy canes :D
Mark trying to pronounce MAOAM put this german into an early grave. (But also pinballs are objectively the best maoam candy ever so slay)
the fucking whistle kills me!!!!
hahaha, definitely a lot not from iceland! but to be fair we share a lot of the same taste here. personally Tyrkisk peber is one of my favorites, and the ones you thought were horribly salt, haven't had those exact ones but i love that type too 🤤🤤🤤
i like this video it was good
I’m sorry stick what in where? 😳
Mark saying the candy that looks like small people are creepy. Me: "Uhm. That's just Jelly Babies" (in SA)
Theres no such thing as volcanos
Mark looks like a pirate lol
That melody candy tickled my brain...like it felt like like someone reached into my skull and tickled my brain with a feather...and it also made me want to fall asleep?  I don't even know...😂
I am day dreaming about mark coming to my country and reviewing our food and candy... I am sad now
I kinda want the whistle jingle for text alerts. :P
With regards to that sneaky gum, that reminds me of the legend of I believe KitKats? That whatever leftover KitKats are tossed back into the mix and all KitKats therefore have some of the very first KitKats in them? It's something like that. I'm too invested to hit pause and investigate, and by the end I will have forgotten. ^_^
The whistle candy is now sold at Cracker Barrel, but it only comes in blue
please try Norwegian candy, or just Scandinavian candy in general😭
The crunch at 26:58 followed by that face got me dead 💀
Before you ask, yes you did just watch a grown man eat candy for almost an hour
Bro looks like Kuzan from one piece wtf
Mark socker ia suger, LOVE YOU BTW❤
is no one gonna talk about the fact mark said there are no cats in iceland?
ive lived in finland for 2 years wnd ill say the candy is similar turkisk peber and the one made my fazer if im bit mistaken is a finnish brand. and salmiakki (salted licorice) is awful however i liked the candy coatef or chocolate ones but hated just pure salted and turkisk peber was so awful im sorry
@Markiplier could I send you some candy I usually ate in Russia/Ukraine for tasting I will write some descriptions with them?❤
4:07 yes
Mark is the only person who'd make a video reviewing Icelanding candy and then vote a *Danish* one as his favourite!
Im from Danmark, and im so happy that he lige the candy from my Home contry ❤
best but longest intro ever
MARK SHOULD TRY SOUTH AFRICAN CANDY
You should try smelling salts. Yk the ones you wake ppl up with. Just get a big whiff and compare it to the “salty hell” licorice
I know what it is, we have it in denmark.
4:40
*CUE GAGGING WHITE CAT*
TOOT SWEET! TOOT SWEET!   THE CANDIES YOU WHISTLE THE WHISTLE YOU EAT!   TOOT SWEET!   TOOT SWEET!   THE EATABLE TWEETABLE TREAT!
The nerds were created from the crumbs of the Everlasting Gobstoppers.
Yes that is the Swedish flag.
:þ
Mark by the end of his career will have the most beautiful videos just because of his endless love for lenses that he has so lovingly (and intensely) shared about on distractible. Hope he gets the manalta f2 lens he was looking for. Note I don’t remember its name,don’t jump me.
Who needs therapy when you have Mark
The first one is called Christmas cat and it is a tradition in Iceland that it could eat children who don’t get clothes for Christmas
6:49 YOU CANNOT TELL ME THAT IS NOT A 100 GRAND BAR BRO
Please Review Russian Candy
As a Swede - I am watching this, cry-laughing at your misery with our candy.
Skole kridt is a danish candy, kridt means chalk and skole means school
Those "from Iceland" and "not from Iceland" are a mess.
as someone who has been learning norwegian, it made me so happy that mark mentioned norway :)
Both skolekridt and tyrkisk peber is danish
I love bob
"Liquorice is an acquired tatse"  Iceland: "your gonna like it..... we will make sure"
6:33 gauana
I need mark to stop saying things about him retiring
I just love the awkward zoom ins on marks face. That and the little candy whistle in between each different type of candy added so much comedic value. Lixian does his job well
the worst thing you'll find in those licorice candies is the ammonium chloride they add to some of those. That stuff is just....ick. Some say it's like drinking window cleaner.
The combination of Marks entertainment skills and Humor and Lixians editing is just the best
29:58 HUMBUG (humbugs are a shape that tapers into a singular straight closing on 2 ends, each closing perpendicular to the other) SPOTTED!!!! likely victorian england in origin. victorian candy makers often made special die cutters for candies called drop rollers that rolled candies into specific shapes all delicately connected by a thin membrane of sugar that, when dropped, separated the drops! Most popular shapes at the height of the production and use of the drop rollers was!!!! Seashells and Humbugs! 🎉 These rollers are also the reason some candies are called things like LemonDrops! Because they were originally drop roller produced candies vs cut, shapes, or broken style candies!  Modern drops are usually produced by large machines or injected into a mold, this candies likely an alternating cutter vs an industrial drop roller machine; there are still candies in england and florida(wild huh?) that use genuine antique drop rollers, cooling tables, taffy pullers, and candy rollers, they make all thier candies by hand and are usually family owned and run, they HAND MAKE candy canes! They roll out, cut, twist, and shape candy canes BY HAND! Cool huh?
Why does the beginning of this have a feel of If markiplier was a character in the office
Lakkrís er góður👍
What is it with Iceland and Licorice?
prepare for long read  the first one is "christmas cat", the second one is swedish and is called "hearty goodness from the alley" or something similar, the third one is "trills" and the description thing is something like "juggling a good two-layer fruit jelly", the fifth one is "star roll" the sixth one is indeed chocolate peppermint, the seventh one literally translated into "turkish pepper", the nipply one is swedish and its something like "raspberry fades away" i think, the hockey pulver is "hockey powder", maoam pinballs are great, the next one is "super set licorice bits" and the description thing is "ryoma chocolate with licorice pieces" or something, the opal thing is "lemon and licorice", the peppermints are peppermints, the wtf sticks are "demons", the risa thing is "thrice", the things he was afraid of because they looked like the salt demon sticks are danish and theyre called something like "school chalk", then more turkish pepper  brought to you by google translate
31:49 WTF?!
43:45 OMG HE SAID IT
Now I want to know which kind of candy Marks grandma keeps in a jar
NOT i mean
DO NOY EAT DODDYS IT WILL KILL YOU
This looks like my place with my dog fluffy but mark some are in iceland
I completely forgot mark was Korean
You dark Markiplier
Do a dark Markiplier
Ammonium Chloride is an odorless, white powder. Solid Ammonium Chloride is used to make dry batteries and Ammonia compounds, as a soldering flux, a pickling agent in Zinc coating and tinning, and a fertilizer. Ammonium Chloride fume, a finely divided particle dispersed in air, is produced in galvanizing operations. um that's prob bad for u
"This seems icelandic." there is a SWEDISH FLAG on the packaging, mark XD
yay, Iceland but don't eat to much it gives you diarrhea
Lakrids by Bülow is Danish,
the face Mark makes when he tries the Hot and Sour Tyrkisk Peber, is amazing.
did he really just say Dutch, as a Nordic Country.....
I watched this the day it came out before, but I'm watching it again now. I heard the whistle that they use for the rest of the video, and my brain instantly thought, "where have I heard this before? Lixian pulled that from a show or something. What was that from?" and then I remembered...
Wait, it's all licorice?
Those mushroom ones, I know how they taste as soon as I saw them I love them but I know why they’re disliked 🤣🤣
How Can he not like hockey pulver??
Its not a nipple its a hat 😭
Omg i love tyrkisk peber, Its danish!
Lol Mark is too weak for salmiac 😝 ah, some of these I knew, like the UFOs or the school chalk (candy coated licorice). Now I want you to go through some German candy (Maoam is German, actually)
pls make more videos with trying candy from other countries!! I am especially interested in dutch candy/food (since I live in the Netherlands)
I should try those... BUT nothing beats a original "Mozartkugel" and those cubes from Fürst in Salzburg. :3
Can try candie from Ireland 🇮🇪 next
the funny thing is a volcano thing did happen in iceland shortly after
4:41 I got bad news that is from Sweden, it has a heat with the Swedish flag also it says heartfull good from Gränna (a place in Sweden)
What happened to Chica?? Did I miss something?
On the melody lollipop it had a song on the wrapper just to let you know
I think I hear punishment from Alex Tima
If mark keeps trying to pronounce these names, he’s going to summon satan
25:33 for *Happy Amy noises* 😆
Mark I thank you for teaching me the English word for Lakritz and I think Maoam is from Germany because I know that stuff but it could be importat from somewhere else and you Englos made me addicted to Cream soda
"Plane, air, sky"  9/11-?
Wait wait waait do americans NOT HAVE MAOAM???🥺🥺 are they a european thing????
The candy "hjärtligt gott från gränna" is super delicious
Markiplier needs to be on a show like Community or Brookly 99.
My man shoulda just had a large bland-í-poka and called it a day >:3
marks videos calm me down after a long stressful day
Next, finnish candies
33:39 I’m telling you Iceland makes candy as a joke
15:19 the camera and lixian are now in cahoots.
should've tried the icelandic shark
Iceland is amazing. Its great to have family there. There are some good candies from iceland like tritlar.
18:50 Mark becomes an ancient Bard of the legendary bone whistle
What kind of bandana is that
mark really whet the whistle
Iceland REALLY likes licorice
the internal arguments he has with himself XD
I love love love the authentic intro it was so adorable and funny, thanks for leaving it in! It really makes you feel like a real person ❤
THESE CLOSE-UPS IM CRYING
the amout of swedish in here..
The second candy being swedish:  Me watching him think it's Iceland's: IT HAS THE SWEDISH FLAG ON IT
I think its licorice
The maid scp candy
I live turking pepers
This just makes me think of Denmark and the HUGE amount of Haribo and licorice candies there (I think maybe it originated there? Please correct me if I'm wrong). I was on the island of Bornholm during my time in Denmark, and the SELECTION of gummies and licorice candies was amazing. Yes, I was surprised by licorice at times, like this time I thought I bought a box of candies or mints to take around with me (it was a box of hard salty licorice candies). Other times were actually nice when it was sort of a combination of licorice and another flavor or a slightly sweeter licorice with some salt taste, like the mushroom licorice candies. As for the Haribo, my personal favorite was the Star Mix, simply because I love variety.
Bülow licorice is AMAZING!! It's expensive, but I recommend you try even if you don't like licorice! It converted my partner!
As an icelandic person its so sad to see that literally like 1/3 of that candy was Icelandic. Liked the video anyways!
Bro the yelling sound when the candy fell had me dead EVERY TIME
i swear to god i thought he was gonna say "Not my grandma because she is dead"
25 minutes into the video: OH lakriss means liqorice! we're learning already!
"I don't want that in me anymore" is outta control 😂😂😂
I really enjoy these videos!
43:41 he said it!! he said the thing!!
not me grabbing my Lakrids by Bülow sampler box that I got for Christmas just to eat the same flavor as Mark at the same time he did. I agree, it's the best licorice I've ever eaten, hands down.
So many youtubers are going to Iceland lately.
I love how Mark always ends up exploding food everywhere due to the lack of bag opening skills
Fun Fact: There is a difference between a Gas Can and a Jerry Can. Gas Can's hold Gas and Jerry Can's hold Water. Don't mix them up even if it would be a hilarious prank for the last couple days of your life.  I used to get those slide whistles candies a lot when I was still in the single digits, they were the best candy for just that reason.
She is absolutely wrong. People have the right to joke about literally *_anything._*
It hurts me that he's gotten them basically all wrong 😅
Iceland does have cats. I saw many while I was there
Man, watching people experience ammonium chloride candy for the first time is always good content
Mark losing his mind over the melody candy is so wholesome
Try Zimbabwean Candy,
I'm full blooded Icelandic, and could u tell me where in Iceland u got the candy...cuz never had...look for "prince polo, or freyju lakkris draumur, or opal, or Sirius...u know how in America u can go in the Korean store and it's all Korean products bet that's what happened to u
WHAT THAT A NEW DOG I SAW AT 48:02!
4:11  Funny you mention that cause a big folklore tale in Iceland is the Yule cat. It’s a giant man eating murder floor that comes around Yule/Christmas to murder the children who didn’t get new clothes for Christmas.
I was waiting for Turkish Pepper! 😂 my favorite! Also it’s danish i believe. As a Swedish person we like our salty liquorish!
REVIEW SOURPATCH JELLY BEANS
I missed the review vids, literally my favorite form of his content.
18:03 they sell these here in turkey too its really delish
thank you amy for keeping us safe from mark's volcanic manifestations <3
the bubble dust is the leftovers from making bubble-tape true story
Mark: i want you to enter my mind *thinking about himself*  that checks out
Markiplier asmr
18:03 That candy is also available here in Portugal 😮
bro hating on hockey pulver made me cry, as an licorice salty lover  its top 5 for me.
tyrkisk peber is actually really good, if you like licorice dont let marks opinion stop you from trying it, and what he tasted inside is a salty powder if i remember right. My cousin and my brothers girlfriend made a chocolate fudge by combining the tyrkisk peber and chocolate some how (dont know the recipe) and its no joke the tastiest fricking sweet ive ever eaten, i love potato chips more than candy, but that fudge takes the cake, if you like licorice, not the shit sweet kind licorice, eat that and you'll never want another type of chocolate or candy ever again, its honestly 11/10. they also add some licorice sprinkles on top.
Socker is sugar 😭
the candy coated licorice would be like good n plenty? All in all I find Mark to be a very likeable You Tube personality. I just discovered him and his work and  I am surprised how much I like him and the several episodes I watched! Oh and BTW there is an Italian candy that is candy coated licorice long and bumpy white or pink and given at weddings. Not salty at all just sweet
The moment he pulled out a melody pop and was like hang on, we have that in Australia 😂
I'm sorry for the ammonium.. we are use to the poison so people react differently who don't know the flavor
The apollo pink lakrits can be unrolled
Most of the candies were Icelandic but the ones that aren't are still super popular here
I'm from Iceland! We are also making volcano jokes !!
If there was a POTC reboot, Mark would hands down be a amazing choice for playing Jack Sparrow!
powdered bubble gum was a 90's kid fav! Bubble Jug here in the US. Miss that candy lol
um , you should not be eating Ammonium Chloride take this from someone that did Chemistry that is ..not suppose to be really eaten 😬
I am swedish = jag är svensk love you markiplier ❤❤❤❤❤
OMG I loved whistle pops back in the day. Cant really find them anymore, you'd have to order them online.
Technique my a*s
You should definitely do Spencer's candy 😂
Someone i knew in high school brought a bunch of candy back from iceland, and one of the ones they had was the djöflar. Once a few of us had tried it, we decided to prank a bunch of people by having them try it without telling them what it was. Its SO salty!!! Some people who tried it actually liked it tho
Mark’s “Why did I do that?” Is me everyday 😂
I wonder how he reacted to Korean candy.
At 4:40, I thought he was going to say, “Not my grandma. Because my grandma… is dead.” 😅😮🤦‍♀️
Mark, Turkish Pepper is a finnish candy. As a finnish person i dont know why they say its spicy either.
the mask...
Bro needs to work on his package opening skills
idk why but mark's reaction made me laugh so hard at 22:30
Mark drinking NA light beer out of a licorice straw has the strongest energy I've seen in a YT video in a long time.
Why Icelandic candy? He's so mysterious. Idk anything about his personal life
mark trying to do some kind of 4D math to figure out if bubbledust is actually icelandic or not absolutely sent me because I'm only a couple of years older than him and that was 110% a thing you could buy in the states in the 90s (though I think it fizzled out due to being a choking hazard when kids much younger than the product was meant for kept stealing it from getting ahold of it)
I really want Mark to try Greek sweets. I KNOW he will love them!
The intro of this video is me in most conversations.
he kind a gives me pirates and the Caribbean vibes
The white colored candy coated licorice is like Mike & Ike. We have that in the states.
Double salty Scandinavian licorice. Imodium chloride salt. LoL
Hello! I'm in the third layer in Markipliers mind and I don't know how to get out! Can anyone help me please
I mean...Iceland is cold and full of vulcanos with little population...Obviously their food sucks. Its all processed or fermented shark.
"Oh No! All licorice!"
30:55 makes me think mark would be a good candidate for a movie or game or something about lovecraftian monsters because that reaction was something else
😂 black licorice is sweet.
So I read up a little on Icelandic candy. It turns out that (quoting from The Reykjavik Grapevine) "due to embargoes and restrictions on foreign candies, liquorice was pretty much the only candy available to Icelanders for hundreds of years.". That's why most of what Mark tasted was based on liquorice. Icelanders love their liquorice!
The second candy he picked was a German candy
Never mind you can still find bubbledust and star dust in United States
We had something like bubbledust in the states  when I was younger omg !!!!
My mother was a volcano and she recently passed. I'm devastated by your lack of compassion in these trying times.
36:53 in the Netherlands whe call that 'stoepkrijt'
i'mspecialandmarklovesme
I now know why my mom hated the whistle candy..... also it freaked out my cats
The socker is another Word for sugar
The first one reminds me of a less appealing looking Lunch Bar, they are South African
They found that the tongue responds to ammonium chloride, which is apparently a popular ingredient in some Scandinavian candies, namely salt licorice. They say that the ability to taste ammonium chloride might have evolved to help organisms avoid harmful substances because ammonium is somewhat toxic.Oct 11, 2023
a lot of these feel better suited toward drink mixes rather than eating it straight up. could explain everyone's adverse reaction to them in the video too
“Write in the comments if you think you know what this is” I’m fully confident I know. It’s candy-coated licorice, known as “licorice bullets” “candy bullets” or “Kleurendrop” and I’m a huge fan of them. I love licorice, personally, but unfortunately not salted licorice, or I’d be in heaven in Iceland. They’re very good!
Mark: "STAHP"  Lixian: _PANIK_
I’m loving marks pronouncement on the first one and it translates to Christmas Cat btw 😂
Try dutch candy
Wow! You don’t have Maoam pinballs in the US? We have them in the UK. I grew up on them!
trailmix
Candy coated licorice?! You mean good and plenty candy!?
31:55
That white candy coated licorice is Dutch candy and it’s called “school krijt” which means “school chalk”, you can actually write on blackboards with it and then eat it to freak people out.
Lol my dad has three nipples
Theres no such thing as volcanoes
alternative title: "49 minutes of me eating licorice"
Dude.. almost none of those are icelandic :D "Jólaköttur" and "Trítlar" was though hahah
I’m getting Jack sparrow character vibes here 😂 3:16
Every time a piece of candy screams i have to pause and go back to hear it again,  its so freaking hilarious 😂
37:05 My guess is salty licorice.  Shit Amy guessed the same thing lol.
I greatly enjoy being reminded every so often that while Mark is handsome, successful, and going places with his movies and shows, at the end of the day he is still just another weirdo. How many people would casually admit on camera that they grind salt into their palm and lick it like a horse? He drank canned corn straight from the can. Several times. Mark "eats" Takis... like that... He truly is one of us.
me: ooo markiplier eating candy let’s go!  me a minute later: *gets trapped in markiplier’s brain*
Actually American gummy’s are not just sugar that is gelifyed but actually most gelatin comes from boiling the bones of pigs and cattle.
aww spencer was there
I think it’s funny how a lot of his guesses that it is authentic were non authentic and the authentic ones he guessed were non authentic
As an Icelander I love all these candy’s
A FOOOOD THEORY
3:02 everyone from indonesia is screaming because there's a best selling chocolate that looked exactly like that
"not my grandma, my grandma is... korean" i thought he was gonna say "dead" helP
5:52 when markiplier becomes the number one biggest gaming youtuber and pewds comes back
Do Mexican candy
38:25 killed me, licorice has become the enemy of Markiplier.
LOVE that the music from smash or pass some how made it's way into this video lmao at 12:39
Just me or do u fell w markiplier vibes 12:52
Hol on are those liquorice babies i love liquorice babys 7:06
My brain auto filled "it's not the heat, it's everything else about it" 😂
Why the fuck does Iceland love its licorice so fucking much oh my god"
i want the jelly babies
can you try norwegian candy next?
So does that mean mark is korean american???
"That's just a theory a foooooood theory " we will miss u mat Pat everyone
este bleaf keirl pak limburgse kroam us is heul likker
9:31 I had that  its kinda good 😅
Mark: IT'S A MONSTER Me:......it's a jellybaby
didn't mark lick one of those cubes of pink salt at some point? and like, showed us progress of how much he had consumed?
A little bit of false information about the gum. But other than that. It’s always good to see markimoo in my feed
I love how mark talks about the powdered gum like it’s a drug.
with the melody pop, i was in 6th grade and there was this kid that would by like 40$ worth of em every week
I did some research. Apparently, almost all candy in Iceland is licorice, and the reason why? That was the only form of candy they could eat for a LONG time, so it's pretty much a baseline for candy production.
We have Tyrkisk Peber in Norway too... and I love it. I dont like Lquorice but I love Tyrkisk Peber... Hockey Pulver too. Its soo good
dang at the slide whistle part I was half expecting him to start playing megalovania
cant unsee jack sparrow
I think the most of what he didn't like was 'salammoniac' xD It's a mostly nordic appreciated flavour, though I do not like it myself. Also love that his favorite was the Bülow liquorice! A little bit of Danish pride! Tho I do not like liquorice either!
“No, gimme the Athletic—“ 😳 the NA beer my mom likes? 🤣🤣
New title: "50 minutes of Intermittent Markiplier ASMR mouth sounds"
13:14
No such thing as volcanoes...too true
Hockey Powder is super good on ice cream
Like to see that Marky is in the club of "Ooh, candy! Think i'll bite into- *My Entire Life Is Pain."*
ah yes, ammonium chloride, used to make dry batteries zinc coating, toxic for human consumption, and eye irritant !
I have three nipples and it makes me feel valued to hear that it is appreciated.
amy is the best part of this video
6:28 my rotten teeth could never
The cubed maoams and the white and red striped mints are everywhere in britain, I'm not sure if we made them but they are very common here Edit, the UFOs things are also common here but there called flying saucers
43:41 just timestamping this so I can watch it again and again
there's a melody pop sitting on my freezer for almost half a year didn't think I'd eat it one day
I love licorice but had to stop eating it because it was making my heart race. Still, chocolate covered licorice sounds really good.
There's no such thing as Volcanoes
Pseudohyperaldosteronism
I think the gum was supposed to look like detergent, then the kids who consume it would imitate the cartoon cliche of eating soap and burping bubbles
So if it tastes bad, it's probably Icelandic.
Mark: Anyone that doesn't have exactly two nipples.... Harry Styles: 😶 Mark: ...... You're special.
Im from the UK, why have i never seen a jerry can of sneaky bubbledust 😢
7:13 WAS THAT A REFERENCE TO WHO I THINK IT WAS
Tyrkisk peber I eat offen and I think its good and not super salty couse we eat so mush salt in sweden
I can show tou Im from sweden I gonna say I eating candy its jag äter godis
On candy two it ses good from       An city thats called granna. Why I now it Its couse I coming from sweden
I could watch mark eat random stuff from all over the world and never get bored for the rest of my life
we have Tyrkisk Pebber in Denmark as well, i was always it had pure pebber in the center
HJÄRTLIGT GOTT FRÅN GRÄNNA RAHHHHH SWEDEN
Fazer is finnish😭
dude i literally think i know what it is
Hey Markiplier, I think that it would be "an adventure" to say the least going into Balkan candy, especially way down like Greece, we have some very weird stuff, I think you would love to come down here or order some Greek candy
21:43 as a man of four nipples thank you mark! And i love you too XD
i must say that the "retention thing".. owrked succesfully :_D  well done in your statistics :D
The disgusted faces are iconic
I stopped paying attention for a little bit and came back to Mark playing some kind of candy flute.  If that does not sum up this channel I do not know what does
As a swede seeing him react to freakin ”häxjävlar” that strongly was surprising. He should try something strong like ”svenskjävlar” instead of this mild liquirice.
Mark please 💀 those "nipples" were mushrooms lmao
I love the intro, but isn't the musical candy just the "Toot Sweet" candy from the movie Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
18:00 (pufferfish eating carrot meme noise)
omg so much salt! Dude no wonder he’s always in the hospital LOL
Big "Spongebob shouting about technique on the common lawn" energy
The fact that only like, 8 out of 20 are icelandic is hilarious  (Might need to recount, but those are the ones I remember)
As soon as I entered Marks mind, all I felt was pain, and, its not like I was enjoying it, but I felt like my body could handle more.
You should travel to Norway once, and try out Norwegian chocolate! Its a hole different level of taste, I promise! I've tasted so many different types of chocolate in my life, but I always come back to the chocolate from my home country Norway c: Believe me, if you haven't tried it, you missing out on something C;
That one from Gränna is swedis
watching this on 2x speed was the best decision *aggressive candy tooting*
I got a licorice ad in the middle of the video. I've never gotten a licorice ad before...
ITS BEEN A WHILE🎶
7:45 skin walker gummies
Could you review Czech candy please ? I really wanna see you taste those
I would love to see Mark eat candy from South Africa. We have some random stuff.
We need more dogo content plz
as a person who moved from iceland after 10 yrs i can tell that icelandic candy is absolutely the best i ever tasted, it may b coz milk in iceland is kinda different than in lot countries i dunno how 2 explain it but fr the milk is awesome n it makes icelandic chocolate sooo good fr n yea icelandic ppl rlly like licorice so its very popular there, personally, 1 of my favs are licorice jellies, n i highly recommend most typical chocolate in iceland "rjómasúkkuladi" (i dont have the specific "d" letter sr) i dunno if mark had it in this vid coz im writin this comment at beginning of it, if it was there, i recommend it to ppl who did read my comment ^_^  edit: yea i js finished the vid n mark u rlly were unlucky w these candies fr most of them arent even icelandic im so sorry 4 u w all that sour shit which werent actually icelandic XDDD
the licorice is indeed swedish (from a sedish girl)
He was sneaky dropping that Food Theory reference
Omg I thought he was about to make the “my grandma’s dead” joke😭😭
Jerrycan originates from ww2 named because until 1942 the allies were using inferior cans that often leaked and burst so whenever they could they'd steal the German wehrmacht can, and due to the British calling Germans Jerrys during ww2 they were called Jerrycans by allied forces and now it's stuck and been passed down to the modern generation, we wouldn't call them gas cans either way because we call gas petrol.
I hate the mint and chocolate trend. 😝
Hvað er hann að gera
5:08
19:59 Markiplier summoning the Oompa Loompas
When he runs out of the last chocolate licorice one he's going to be feinding to get more and I bet he will fly back just to get more lmao😂
Mark: "I'm more mature than I look" but didn't you get a score of 7 on a mental age test years ago?
swear to god these are my favorite videos of yours
As an icelandic peson i can confirm that there are actually cats in iceland
The slide whistle transition between candies made my day
The Gränna one is swedish i bet, but it's pathetically shit because grandma is Farmor/Mormor (depending on which parents parent it is) and i just think it's some older way of saying both of them. Rörnu rulla is maybe swedish? Possibly finnish. Rörnu sound finnish since in sweden we don't usually end a sentance with U. Rulla however means roll in swedish, but i'd say it's swedish since it says "lakris" which is licorice in swedish. TYRKYSK PEBER ON THE OTHER HAND might want you to think it's swedish (i hate you for thinking everything yellow and blue is swedish, I'M NOT AN IKEA PERSON) is not swedish and i'm confident that it isn't, because pepper in swedish is peppar, not peber. However i do think it's finnish/icelandic, so maybe.  The "nipples" one is swedish, the text is swedish, the currency is swedish, the flag is swedish. Even eaten it on a "swedish only" candy restaurant down in ystad. Hockey pulver is also swedish, pulver is infact pulver in swedish too, but my main argument is that the guy on the image is swedish. Socker is also swedish for sugar. I was going to say super sett is swedish, but that's definetely icelandic, spot on.  If you see text with the little ´ above them sometimes, like súper sett LAKRÍS BITAR, you know it's icelandic! Opals are 100% icelandic, i can tell by the words with apastrophes. 28:46 these have no actual name, some call them bismarks, which is on this one, but some just call them minty reds. Depends on where you are. These are swedish, and i have them in my candy closet. Djöflar is swedish, it's a knockoff from Salta Jävlar. (it's just licorice meant to be so salty your tongue dries out) Lakrisrör means licorice pipe in swedish. so yeah it's swedish. All the inbetween i'm either unsure or are icelandic.
Marks in his Will Turner era
“There’s no such thing as volcanoes”  -Markiplier 2024
Proud to say one of my friends met this man at a chipotle down here in Irving 😭🙏🏻
the melody pop is a toot sweet and no one can tell me otherwise
13:14 mark became a pufferfish
why does he look like big boss
Skolekridt!
MatPat reference is wild
I really like the super salty licorice, however I usually only eat one, two tops. It makes it easier to not eat a whole bunch of candy at once. (I'm Swedish)
Him saying the food theory thing was my favorite
only in ohio
As an Icelandic person this is amazing
maybe try mexican candy some time? i love the videos where you review candy or food!
A finn here, hi! Fazer (the tyrkisk peber candy) is from finland! 😂
FYI, the nipples are supposed to be mushrooms and they are from Sweden.
I truly adore using Mark's whistle song as a transition.
Turkish pepper is Finnish, isn't it?
You should try Lithuanian candy next😊
26:47 THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID
11:24, Plz don't go too!!!!! 🥺
you look like a pirate
Did you do a follow up where you tell us which ones were actually Icelandic!? I HAVE TO KNOW!!!!!!!
26:47 this part cracked me up so much 😂
I absolutely roared every time a candy yelled as it fell off the table.  Why is that so dang funny?
BTW, ammonia is in a LOT of our raw vegetables like lettuce, cabbage, onions, garlic, cucumbers, etc...
Actually, Mark. That specific beer says it has less than 0.5% alcohol by volume so that means it does have SOME alcohol in it. I hope you don't have any issues later on.
A salt is just a result of an acid and base chemical reaction. Sodium Chloride is what we call table salt. The saltiness you detect on your tongue is the ionization as the sodium and chloride break down into cations and anions. There are stronger base and acid elements that will produce a stronger reaction on your tongue. ALSO, the faster a salt is dissolved by your saliva, the saltier the taste will be. Sea salt, if in an easier dissolvable form, will taste saltier than normal table salt.
The whistle Lollipop is my favourite it’s so yummy
Lixian is killing me with the flute jingle.
"But hey, that's just a theory!"
everyone i know thinks im crazy for dipping individual popcorn pieces into the orange salt, thank you for affirming my eating habits mark
Finland has been mentioned!!!! Turkinpippurit!! yeeees!
As a swed I can confidently say that a little less than half of those candies were swedish.
really enjoyed that video!! The whistle lollipop is the OG shit from the playground 🤝🏽 And the MAOAM is from Germany, where I live it also has a sour filling which I think you will really enjoy 💗💙  AND THANK GOD, THAT YOU DIDN'T Eat the the tube gum because It was stale 1000% I loved  to eat it and it never looked like that. 🙏🏽 Love you Mark, love you Amy, keep it going 💜
Im Icelandic andcim very happy ab this
The fact that most of these are danish and swedish, thoooo
41:24  AND I-  I-...I- ble😛😛
Those Maoam Pinballs are actually Maoam Kracher and are a German product 😁
Actually, bro… Dextrose is so good for your body. It’s your brains number one choice of fuel. So those dextrose candies aren’t the worst for you unless they have a crazy amount of other ingredients👍
Iceland really likes salt and licorice, apparently. Good to know.
18:53 when I was a kid, this was an iconic lollipop in Czech...
I love that he got Svenskjvlar! The saltiest licorice there is, it tastes like pain at first then its yum! lol also those peppermints are from Gränna in Sweden. Fun fact, you can go there and watch them make it
43:11 this joke killed me it’s so funny-
Mark looks more and more Korean everyday
“Alright, phew he saw the Swedish flag”  *puts it in the islandic pile*  😭  Also for all the fellow Swedish people: imagine he accidentally just bought a packet of snus 😂
I find it funny this is their first experience with salmiak. I loooove it. And I love liquorice. But I’m Dutch, this is what I grew up with lol. Rather have salty candy than sweet once in a while.
Dare we ask what the score was on whether he was correct?
Kind of suprised Maoam was there.
I would hate all of these 😂
That lollie Whistle was the best, Even Chica came to see what was going on 😂❤
It’s always fun to see people outside of Scandinavia try Ammonium chloride for the first time. I loved it as a kid, (still do) and it sure is an acquired taste but still 22:59
swed here- the secound one is swedish is all i know XD
36:07 HOW DID I KNOW IT WAS GONNA BE MORE LICORICE
how many did he get right?
I was just about to say "hey we have those rasberry things in Sweden" then ye old flag came up on le bag
Is this Ethan's house? Where is he???
I dont know how i missed this 2 weeks ago but now i get to enjoy the review chaos
chocolate covered licorice is my favorite candy! I guess I gotta take a trip to iceland sometime
hello hi danish guy here, there was a looooot of danish stuff there <3 mostly all the "bad" lakrids you ate <3
Omg the whistle candy brings me back to the childhood 😢
Now step into my mind
Anyone else think the whistle candy sounds like Puppycat from Bee and Puppycat?
I’m sad u used the candy flute wrong it would be more fun for you u but it’s fine😅
hokey pulver e ein stor dell av mi barndom så de e steikje med rart å se noken ikkje synast nokje om de   Translated : hockey powder is a big prat of my childhod so it is (norwegian exaguration word) weard to se someone that just dont think annything good of it
Yayyy Amyyyy!
I went to Iceland a long time ago and I never forget how amazing it was
Plane air TOWER 😮

Do you want an Australian army Ration pack?
We better get that Candy Whistle for future review videos when a new entry comes up.
Hey! I'm so glad you've tried the melody pops at 18:02! I'm not Nordic but this was one of my go-to childhood candies in the Middle East. It's definitely not from Iceland though. I barely blew into it, but man, I did enjoy sucking it off!
loved how spencer was there with chica and henry when he let the dogs out :)
9:54 eh not an issue, do you eat Nerds Mark? Nerds candy originally started out as left overs in the spinny machines from Gobstoppers.
'Happy Amy Noises' 😆😆😆  Sorry! Estoy de cochina 😂😂
Mark : "I like Licorice but im not the biggest fan of it"  *Proceeds to eat only licorice items for the whole video*
Markiplier can u plz plz plz do one of the "world's most sour candy" ????? Plzzzzzzzzzz
im icelandic, and i can tell you Þristur (pronounced Thristur ; ''Þ'' makes a TH sound) is one of the most beloved icelandic candy. my friends from abroad always ask me to bring Þristur with me when i visit. Highly recommend trying !
I love licorice but was shocked by the salted unsweetened covered in chocolate I found in candy machines in Iceland. LOVE Iceland, but that ain't it lol
When you get catfished on Tinder 38:53
My question is why is Spencer there? If hes there wheres Ethan? Lol
the asmr in this is crazy
It turns out that it was in fact the Swedish flag
I need that jug candy I remember early 2000 the bubblejug so I would like to relive my childhood please
The saltiness comes from the salmiak. We have alot of salmiak candy here in Holland that have salmiak or are just pure salmiak. Either you hate it or you love it
Nooo the game theory reference 😭😭😭
1:00  just as empty as space its self because thats all mark wants. Is to fuck space
This has no Business being this funny 😂😂😂😂
It’s off topic, but is Mark gonna play poppy playtime chapter 3?
change the title to Mark eating licorice for 49 minutes🤣
The powder gum is something I grew up with. It's fun lol
Like highkey thank you for the subtites i have misophonia and it is really hard to listen to people chew but im glad i can still watch the video and know whats going on 😍😍
How often do you eat candy?
33:07 must be the ammonium chloride
Yoo that licorice candy has ammonium chloride in it. That's used for balancing out the body's acidity out in a clinical setting, not for candy wtf 🤣
Here to forever request BOTH puppers make it into more content xP
Please for the love of god try Mexican candy
Entirely unrelated but i WANT THE JACKET MARKET HAS. Well, maybe not THAT specific one, but y'know, I want to know what jacket it IS so I can buy it MYSELF
CLIP YOUR NOSE HAAAAAAIR
great content, would love to see another video of you trying Icelandic candy so many great candy you missed. 8 of the 22 you tried were Icelandic,  2 then i did not know, the rest not Icelandic  first one the Jólaköttur is Icelandic, the Jólaköttur is part of the Icelandic Christmas folklore and he is Grýla's cat,  Grýla is the mother of the 13 Icelandic Santa's and in the folklore the cat eats children who don't get at least some clothes for Christmas. there is more to the Christmas folklore than i wrote here. 2nd one is not Icelandic it is Swedish  3rd one the Trítlar is Icelandic and the text says something like this:  Crazy good two layer fruit gummy 4th is not Icelandic 5th one the stjörnu rúlla is Icelandic and its licorice and Marzipan i believe  6th one with out seeing the name or label on it i don't know if it is Icelandic then its probably hand made as i have never seen anything like this in any grocery store 7th Tyrkis peber is Finnish aka Fazer is a Finnish company. its salmiaki licorice thats inside the Tyrkis peber i believe and thats suppose to be the spicy/hot thing about it. 8th the Chuba Chups whistle is Spanish Company. 9th the one referred to as niples is actually mushrooms svampar in Swedish is mushrooms. 10th Hockey Pulver is Swedish, pulver im guessing is powder and socker in Swedish is sugar. 11th  is not Icelandic its German. 12th is 100% Icelandic and actually if i'm not mistaking Nói Síríus the company that makes this candy bar created/sold the first Chocolate and Licorice bar (look at end of text for more explanation on what i mean) in the world (not sure there), sometime in the 80's after kids in 60's in Iceland had been buying licorice rolls and chocolate bars and eating them together and from that came Eitt Sett (in English one set) that's the original one and the funny ish thing about that one is that it's a bar of chocolate and a roll of licorice laying on top and it's called Eitt Sett (one set), the Super sett is just a part of that family tree of Eitt Sett. 13th Opal is 100% Icelandic and the one you tried is probably not the best one you could have tried its citrus and licorice flavoured (menthol i believe) . There used to be a Blár Ópal at 1 point of time in Iceland and it was hugely popular it made your tongue a bit numb for a moment ive heard and it no longer exists due to some reasons im not sure about but i think probably a ingredient no longer made. 14th not sure again if this is Icelandic or not but the origin of peppermint candy is German i think. 15th is Icelandic and the name of it is Demons in English. 16th the gum that looks like Toothpaste bottle is not Icelandic 17th Risa Þristur is Icelandic and Risa just means Giant as this is a larger version then normal, this one is also very popular in Iceland. 18th is not Icelandic 19th again its Finnish. 20th is Belgian i believe. 21st Licorice straw is Icelandic and was is popular back in the day maybe still to drink Appelsín (orange soda) with it. 22nd Johan Bulow  is Danish, we have many products that are similar to this. Back in 2022 Iceland had a bit of thing with the company as they said on their website that stated that he got the original idea of covering liquorice with chocolate, and then developed the idea further in 2009 with the help of his production manager, in spite of people being skeptical.  “People were at first skeptical about the idea, but the popular product ,A, soon saw the light of day” said in the description of Bülow’s chocolate covered liquorice balls. Iceland had been doing this exact thing (chocolate coverd licorice balls) for many years and before that making chocolate and licorice together. there were news articles about that, people who work in the candy business were talking about it. the President of Iceland even tweeted about that and it got corrected and an apology was received from the maker himself so no beef there and all good in the end, professionally handled  loved the content again 🙂
Best thing of this video is the creation of the perfect whistle interlude.
the fyrst candy i can confirm is from iceland
rip laufey
The why that he said: There is a cat on their. Does Iceland have cats? Like omg im from Iceland and i have a cat. LOL😂
Black licorice is my all time favorite
I sniffed Hockey Pulver on a dare once. It was epic.  edit: they paid for my meal lol
I hella love tyrkisk peber :D Salmiac liquorice is the best.
Iceland literally having volcanic activity after this came out 😮😮😮😮😮
I like to think that Markiplier will just ask lixian things in his everyday life
you should review German candy next
When it comes to chocolate covered "licorice", get yourself a Big Turk. Made by Nestle in Canada. You can thank me later.
Puppy
After this video I really wanna see him try Swedish candy, we have some pretty gross stuff xp
The tyrkish peber made me laugh so hard, cause I am from Finland, and it is from Finland, hence Fazer. And Mark was so cofused, and I THINK it is actually pepper inside it, I myself *hate* it.😃
Most of what I'm getting from this is buy these candies if you want to make your child cry and hate candy forever
What happened to chica
Mark: Jullflargcrafmackillesalmiakuud  I heard Salmiak in there; I know where this is going
At 4:35 I thought he was going to say my grandma is dead💀
Wait... I remember sucker whistles when I was a kid... that may be American 😅
I really like that coat and I want one. Does anyone know what it is?
loving the repeating whistle sound
Some people have identity crises in like 30yrs old or 50yrs old, but some have them in just random times. This dude had one some day and next day he just went like ”now i identify as african american. AND wear durag!!! Grey one!!”
Someone could REALLY do something with the clips of mark playing the candy slide flute
I could see someone in Iceland not wanting to go to this kid's birthday party, so for revenge they show up with a bunch of those whistle suckers for the kids. Can't take them away without causing a fuss, either lmao
Remember, eating 2 ounces of black licorice a day for two weeks can cause a heart rhythm. Icelandics are built different.
its just a theory A FOOD THEORY (best line ever)
Had an ex from the Netherlands. A lot of countries like Sweden, the Netherlands, Iceland, etc. love their salted licorice. It was entertaining to see Mark try the many forms salted licorice comes in.
I Review Licorice Candy
licorice is edible poison.
Welcome to “Markiplier roasting an entire country ASMR”
"there's no such thing as volcanoes" - literally just saw news of a new volcano outbreak on Iceland.😮
I thought Mark's mind would just be *camera lens camera lens camera lens camera lens*
Tyrkisk Peber is actually danish .... which.... yeah, Iceland technically belongs to Denmark....but.... idk...  I don't think Iceland wants to belong to Denmark... haha.
As a Norwegian we have a BUNCH of these candies and I personally love most of them
The first one looks like a 100 Grand
Liquorice and raspberry is a favourite combination here in Sweden. But Liquorice and chocolate is an Icelandic speciality (in my opinion). I'm sad you did not bring Draumr or Sterkar djupr, because they are really good! What you thought were "nipples" are supposed to be mushrooms.  Salmiakki (the salty liquorice with ammonium chloride) is a very Finnish thing. But all the Nordic countries are big liquorice fans. Tyrkisk peber is my favourite :-)
OH HY MARK
As a Dane this is way too funny😂 The skolekridt is a classic in Denmark
Why does everyone say dutch instead of danish😢
The volcano in Grindavík just erupted as we speak
The second candy is swedish
Not mark basically calling the netherlands a nordic country and completely forgetting denmark 💀 Also, skole kridt and tyrkisk peber is danish if i remember correctly
This is the trimmings at the bottom of the conveyor belt they scooped into a can. LMAO!
out of the whole video im so glad chica got a few seconds in it because the last time i ever saw a video with her in iti was getting over it
Where can I get that jacket??
15:36 ah yes, I love spicy airheads
Tyrkiszk peber is Finnish!
It's so weird that most of the candy had licorice in it
BOAR SPEAR
did anyone went googling about ammounium chloride and found out that is normally used to make batteries???
Black licorice…. Yuck
Its my first time watching mark since a long time, and this 1:35 exact moment doesn’t make me regret👍🏻
You need to taste more, pls
Im from iceland and i used to sniff the hockey pulver, dont know what mark is complaining about😂😂
Best quote: 'Ooh! Bulbous nodules! I like bulbous nodules!' gave me a good giggle xD
this would be a great Will Turner costume
Alternate title: Mark tries candy he bought in Iceland (most of which is not Icelandic)
We got melody lolipops in Czechia too. Top favourite candy when I was a kid. :D  Bonus info: From what I found they were first made in 1970 by Spangler Candy Company  had a few years pause and then were reintroduced by Chupa Chups.
34:50 every asmr video
🌋
YOU don´t bite though the middle 11:50 - you roll it out. And its Icelandic
23:17 And Mark would know about consuming ammonium 😏
Sure do like how "Is that is Swedish flag" happened right as my town's emergency alarm went off.
Why do i get so much enjoyment when someone who doesn't like salty liquorice 😂 I love salty liquorice
now you have to review norwegian candy so i wont be sad as a norwegian
MARK!! PLEASE SPEAK UP FOR PALESTINE!
YESSSSS!
The second candy is from sweden 😅
you are same with John Wick😅
about that volcano
This video should be titeld trying Swedish candy
My senior class trip is actually going to be in Iceland this year and this was pretty funny and interesting to watch
so.. which one's are icelandic?😂
Struggling with the peppermint package and rising any help is such a man thing to do lol
What is mark doing with Spencer? Did Ethan got rid of him?😢
Flying Saucers are Belgian-British
When you played the whistle, my cats were laying with me peacefully and suddenly got up and started freaking out
Darkiplier came back-
Far west, across the sea, there is a land called Vinland. It's warm. And fertile. A faraway land, where neither slave traders nor the flames of war reach.
Language things in the names of the candy - Icelandic has æ, ö, þ, ð, and vowels with acute accent marks on them, but does not have ä, å, or ø like some of the other nordic languages do.
CRONCH CROAAAOOONCHAH
Mark when you use your new Lenses. trim your nose hair XD
The edit at 25:05 kills me and I have no idea why XD
Mark looks like a pirate with that headband
he should've tried noa kropp. basically like mini maltesers
Any Icelandics in the comments? Much love from Canada!
22:30 i thought that was citric acid or maybe vitamin c in powder form. nevermind
Why does Mark look like a young solid snake?
would love another comeback to Raft
Me sitting here with three nipples 😧🤣
50 Minutes of Mark's Mouth Sounds
I wonder if the candy tastes different depending where your from like your race will im American and I like spicy food witch isn't American it's Mexican from Mexico from the past in Mexican culture but mainly food from Mexico authentic but anyways would that change your taste depending where your from taste different but over we are all human so maybe that's not true like Snickers vs some other candy not from America and is American vs from another country and taste similar and if you like it
The tyrkisk peber is such a statement danish hard candy. If you’re danish you LOVE them. And they are spicy but only if you kinda suck out the powder into the middle. And if you eat a few lol. So fun to watch as a Dane lmao
So Mark you just spoke swedish
Hjärtligt gott från Gränna is Swedish, and it mens - hartly good from Gränna
The "Skolekridt" and "tyrkisk peber" is danish candy, i do belive :)
Hi! Resident Swede here~  "Hjärtlight gott från Gränna" directly translates to "Heartily Good from Gränna (pronounced like "Grenna")" and is from Sweden!
Honest to god, every time i see one of your review videos it makes my entire week
I'm so sad, I had a whistle pop once and didn't realize it was a slide until after I had half-eaten it and couldn't use it anymore!😭
I missed these! Poor Mark 😂
Several of these are from Sweden :)
Icelandic candy is always a gamble
Bros never seen mushrooms before 😂
39:01 - Are they like Icelandic licorice warheads?  Also this is why a couple of my friends told me I'd love Icelandic candy 🤣🤣🤣🤣. I eat a ton of licorice as a treat. My great grandma was from England and I think she used to have All Sorts or Salted licorice all the time.
TRY MEXICAN CANDY
Fazer is a Finnish company that has been making candy for +100 years 👍
Chica just appears in the background when Mark is blowing the whistle 😂
the whistle in between candies gets me everytime
1:45 DARKIPLIER
Can you review Turkish candy?
Ok more then half of the things was swedish 😂
Seeing so much Swedish candy end up in "probably icelandic", especially when it had a swedish flag on it, is... some kind of feeling. :P
As a Swedish individual I can confirm that it was swedish flag and it's said heartly tasty from Gränna which is a Swedish candy store 4:36
lmao the volcano in iceland actually went off, grindavik is dead
That fazers tyrkis peber candy is Finnish candy and fazer is a Finnish company that makes all kind of sweets:D.and also bread and stuff like that
1:42 that made me scared of the licorice chocolates
Im not one second in and I already love this video, only because Im excited to see Markiplier taste candy from my country and see his reactions 😂
Hi Markiplier I'm a huge fan I really would love to play some games with you it would be a huge honor and I have watched pretty much every one of your videos and tell lixian that he has always given me good laughs even through my darkest moments and I also want you to know that I hope someday I can introduce my 8 month old daughter to your videos
Charlie* tasting condoms and ranking it  Mark* tasting ice land candy
31:46 Bro looked like Mad Eye Moody from Harry Potter 😂
Welcome to an episode of Markiplier eats 30 different types of liquorice
I was hoping he'd hit something with salmiakki. I was not disappointed. The "wtf" and expression was AMAZING. Had me trying to contain a laugh lol. (sharing a room with my mother right now  and its after midnight lol)
Jokes on all of us, this video is made of licorice
Markiplier out here giving off Jack Sparrow hopped up on sugar vibes lol
Markiplier I need you to hop on Poppy play time NOW!
Fun fact mark, ammonium chloride is often used as a cough suppressant in cough medicines so…at least you won’t have a cough for a while? Oh, and it’s also used in glue….
That repeating tune was funny to me for some reason
I love mark's slow transformation into Pirate Keanu Reeves
"this is the sweetest thing we have... actually its not sweet its salty" LOL
One of the best things about the melody pops is that they have melodies in the wrapping that you can play
Did Mark move?
as a icelandic person this video is hella lit and hockey pulver is crazy good
Do Argentinian candy next!!!!!
you know what im going to put the answers here. we'll see if mark was right
Half the candy spilling into Mark’s lap and him just grabbing it will looking at the camera like nothing happened iissss big ADHD mood
This leave us a lesson, never ever chew a icelandic candy ☠️
Hey mark. I live here on the border by Mexico. I’m more than happy to send you some popular Mexican candy and snacks here. I love to have you review it and if you do go this route, please let me know what you’re allergic too. Thanks again mark, love ya
Is that a bandana or neck gator?
Mark looks like hes part of pirates of The Caribbean cast
As someone who will be going to Iceland in 2 years, its good to know which delectable treats to try out first.
He ate turkish pepper, a probably danish/norwegian candy in iceland. Also Mark being uncultured swine BITING INTO CANDIES MADE TO BE SUCKED
The þ sign is called “thorn” it’s pronounced like the “th” sound we know today!
Whistle pops are from the 70-80s in America
Come to Norway my friend. We have OIL!!!!! Also we have simply amazing chocolate made by Freia, they did get bought by Mondelez but it is still far superior to danish, swedish, british and obviously american chocolate.     He's american right? The korean might dull the oil addiction but he does have it right?
No in Switzerland the kids used to love Tubble gum its so good
Hope you come back to Iceland to taste more candy! You read the labels real good me and my kids are having so much fun listening to you master it 😂 you get 6/10 and that is a high number for a non Icelandic.
Definitely had the “Powdered” Gum Growing up. And I’m From Ohio lol
Imma gonna judge this so hard also upset i didnt see u reeee
37:07 rubber bubble gum ?
Alt. Title: “Mark tries different ways people can  make liquorish into other candy, oh and Iceland candy”
Spencer is just chilling 😂
I'm fully convinced that the only people that like Salmiak are old people who can't feel anything anymore, and are desprately trying to
I love how Mark includes his editor in his videos 😂😂 makes it so much better
wow gränna (in sweden) it was a swedish flag i have been there it is a candy store that sells candy canes and stuff like that (mostly candy canes).
it's weird though how that he said about the volcanoes i think there was a volcano eruption in iceland this week or last so uhm dont jinx it again :)
My cats went kinda psycho when he started playing the slide whistle candy. One of them jumped started running through the living room with an arched back and a very fluffy puffed tail. The other one just stared straight at the TV until he stopped.
I need the Candy Whistle Jingle as a ringtone
Try Finnish candy
As somebody who has recently started using sea salt harvested from Bonaire, I think the “super salty” one might just be using Icelandic sea salt. I’ve learned quickly how horrifyingly potent sea salt can be.
36:32 We have those in Norway too.  We used to go buy those and then bring them to school and replace them with the chalk in the classroom  💀 It is called "school chalk" soo
There are cats in Iceland, quite a few species have been found. Might I add really fluffy ones lol
Ayo why does Mark look like an Asian Jack Sparrow, a whole snack
Ammonium chloride is used as a yeast replacement in bread, or in glue for wood. There is other types of methods, the wood part through me off.
That was a Swedish flag, Icelandic has red.
I love Amy’s contributions to this video! 😂
Whoever that lady is needs to see a therapist about that fear of volcanos or offending people lol.
45:39 I don't like licorice, but there was a taste test of it on an airport (Munich or Frankfurt I don't remember) and it's really-really good. I bought 2 jars, a white chocolate-strawberry and a milk chocolate coated one.
Salmiak is a type of salt used for conserving fish xD I know it's very popular sweet in Finland. There is this liquor drink called Salmiakki, which has salt and tar - yes, black tar in the ingredients and it smells worse than it tastes xD
Dear Amy and Lixian. We hope youre doing ok.
Sorry to say mark but i feel most of that candy is Swedish based on the language and colouring.
I absolutely hate that he is biting every hard candy!!!! So evil!!! 😠  So, anyways, wonderful video~
Is it just me or that man just looks like John Wick?
hello why is spencer at marks house lmao? is he pet sitting for ethan
Non alcoholic does notwan no alcohol athletic light still has 0.5% alcohol which adds up if drinking to many in one sitting please stay safe!
There's more dutch food in there than Icelandic
Literally had those like really salty ones like two days ago and I think they are really good and honestly not that salty
It's like some kind if nougat and caramel...   No it's not
27:28 I was eating at this precise moment and started choking because of that scream. I have since recovered.
Here for the intro
At 28:57 when I got an email and it played that default 'doo duu' sound perfectly in time with the two syllable word 'scissors'. Nothing more to add, I just thought that was kind of interesting.
lol my family is all icelandic so a lot of these im used to eating, glad you got to try em tho!!
“Oooooaaaammnaah” 6:34
does anyone know what that headband is that mark's wearing?
Bbbbbbbbb
Guys, I haven't watched Mark for a little while due to some hyperfixations of mine why does he look like a pirate now?
You should try fazer chocolate from finland!!!!
Ammonium chloride is use to make dry battery and is not safe to eat according to GOOGLE
17:25 shut up i was literally in the act of eating twizzlers.
mike and ike
why all the licorice tho thats crazy! I know cultural things stay the same usually but man its 2024 they dont have to live with candy from 1734
Is that Spencer with Chica & Henry?
We need more pup pov in these videos
Greetings from Finland! Fazer's Tyrkisk Peber is from here. It's called ''Turkinpippuri'' in Finnish :) it's very popular candy here and I personally love them! They have salty liquorice powder (which is made from ammonium chloride) on the inside.
It´s got a swedish flag on there.. "Gränna" is a location in Sweden
Never a dull day when you have mark trying different snacks outside of his Culture
THE WHISTLE CANDY SOUNDS LIKE PUPPYCAT
Markiplier my sister was kissing her baby doll when I walk into her room😂
Out of all candy i didnt expect haribo to be included doesn't everyone know thats German? 😂
“open up for me” “they arent hard” “i dont want this in me anymore”
Maoam is actually a huge German candy maker, lol. I still remember their ads on TV from the 2000s.
It's almost all icelandic
We the dutch are not nordic, markimoo ples dont say these dangerous things. You'll upset our king.
When he keep saying a cat doesn’t live on Iceland I literally own a cat😅 I LIVE ON ICELAND!!!
Krakkar frá Íslandi🇮🇸 👇
I live on iceland but in iceland i say Ég bý á Ísland😂
*Mark reviewing Icelandic candy. *Me watching Mark eat a whole load of British Sweets. 😂
Likely
3:04 it’s a boost bar
Spencer lives with Mark now?
I have so much respect for mark when hes filming the lixian bits, improvising to thin air for the sake of the bit must make him feel absolutely insane
28:49 😂
Also known as: I Can't Believe It's Not Licorice! With Markiplier.
Me “as an Icelandic person” learned that if you believe in elf’s you die if you ever told anyone about the elf’s but if you don’t believe in elf’s you die.  It terrified me as a child but you know I think it was just a story or that’s what I hope… Plus there’s a troll in Iceland that eat the children if they don’t behave in December🤭
Jólaköttur is probably icelandic cause im from iceland and in icelandic folklore the yule cat(jólakötturin) eats the children that dont get chlothes for christmas
as a local its so funny seeing him trying to pronounce the icelandic words
23:06 you're saying that you often get forced to have a golden shower on you then? 😂
As an avid hater of liquorice…I have learned from this video never to buy sweets from Iceland.
i swear at some point Mark just turned into some Neandertal who just discovered fire OMG 🤣 31:40 OMG 47:00 THIS is my FAVOURITE LICORICE chocolate! I love it!!!!!! I'm so glad Mark loved it as well<3
haha! I’m Icelandic and i really enjoyed watching this video because i’ve eaten everything in it ✌️
18:03 we have those in Slovakia 👌 40:37 UFOs!!! We also have these
choklad is chocolate in swedish (ive been to ikea)
wait im so fucking confused i thought mark couldn't drink alcohol 😭
i have been to iceland and the chocolate was soo good
When I was little, I used to watch you a lot.
you need to review german candy
i loved how many danish candies there were in this group! <<<<33333
at that ough at the hokey puck hes whole korean antsestory came out
a nearly 50 minute video of just... zoomed in clips of mark eating candy, in shockingly good quality. brother is living the life HAHAHAH
i have seen that wistle at a corner shop in Swizerland and you are playing it wrong
Why is Mark dressed like a Pirates of the Caribbean extra
Markiplier really said “domain expansion, infinite void..”
I loved when Mark was being a musician with the candy and he seemed so happy ❤
Oops! All Licorice
He said thank you to Amy and Chica but not sweet Henry. Where's the love for da boi! Also sorry for all the licorice you had to taste. I think it got better once your palette was use to it.
marklpler be leik lemmer að hoppa í bónus hhahahahahahahah xddd
mark for your next food video i dare you to eat all dog treats and rate the best one lmfaooo
Genial Jhon Wick 😎
He gotta try mexican candy. Those candies are delicious as hell
I was about to say I saw these from Sweden before😂 6:01
I remember the swedish salt licorice, and yeah, is 90% salt
this reminds me of when ian and anthony from smosh reveiwed foreign candy that their fans sent them.
i went to Iceland a few years ago and Im so sad you didn't get to see the iceland cats, the place i was had so many indoor/outdoor cats and they were all so friendly
6:50 Pretty sure Mark just summoned an elder god right then.
MAOAMS DONT EXSIST IN AMERICA?? I GET A PACKET EVERYWEEK
"Does Iceland have cats? I don't think I ran into a single cat over there." Mark, my father's been to Iceland and he found multiple Cat Cafes to frequent during his trip. (Maybe you just didn't run into them because they're public employees? :3 )
I’m from iceland  So I’m gonna tell you if they’re authentic or not   1: is authentic it’s called Christmas cat in English it’s based on the Christmas cat that eats bad kids  2: one is Swedish so not authentic   3: one is authentic Icelandic candy   4: one is not authentic obviously lol it’s in English it’s probably just imported from Britain   5: one is authentic it means star roll and it’s a very iconic candy atleast to me it’s a very popular candy   6: one is I have no idea I have never seen it before but it looks kinda authentic but 🤷   7: one is not authentic it’s imported from somewhere else   8: is not authentic lol it’s imported probably from Britain   9: is Swedish again not authentic it has the Swedish flag  10: is not authentic but it’s very popular here in iceland but I hate it but yeah it’s lycrish   11: is not authentic it’s imported from Britain I believe   12: is authentic it’s a lycrish bar lycrish is very popular here almost Icelandic candy has lycrish  13: is I think it’s authentic I think opal is Icelandic brand but I’m not sure   14: is I don’t know I haven’t seen it before  15: is Authentic it means devils lol it’s a very strong lycrish   16: is not authentic it’s imported I believe also our stuff is always safety seals so it’s probably tampered with I wouldn’t eat it lol  17: is authentic it means threse 3  18: is not authentic and it’s supposed to look like the chalk   19: is not authentic lol  20: is not authentic it’s probably British   21: your not supposed to drink through it 😭 it’s authentic I believe it’s just called a lychees straw cause it looks like it   22: is not authentic I think it’s German   Bye bye lol
Ammonium Chloride is an odorless, white powder. Solid Ammonium Chloride is used to make dry batteries and Ammonia compounds, as a soldering flux, a pickling agent in Zinc coating and tinning, and a fertilizer. Ammonium Chloride fume, a finely divided particle dispersed in air, is produced in galvanizing operations.
This video should be called Watch Mark being unable to open candies😅😅
please review portugese candy next
I'm I the only who thought that mic was a car key
One tricky thing about identifying food is whether it is something originating or made inside the country, or if it os something manufactured elsewhere but targetedly sold there for the citizens specific tastes
the cat is one of the biggest candy companies in Iceland 😆
give me candy! :D
I died when he read thris as "Rist" and "Pris"
Do people with ADHD like salt? Is that a thing? My sister also will add extra salt to everything and my dad likes salty snacks and they are also ADHD.
licorice and salmiakki is the best
I'm from Iceland and i have to say it was a lot of fun watching you eat some of our candy!
595kr for turkisk peppar??????? what the, that is stupid much XD
Seriously Markiplier you should start doing a survival series just how you look
Maoam Pinballs (or Kracher as they're called in germany) are one of my favourite candies too! They're *so* great, I always have to be careful to not eat a whole package by myself...
You should try different Finnish candies. There is so many chocolate ones and fruity ones
Mark biting the gummies in half instead of just eating em made my fat ass mad 😂 stop bein a gentleman mark just eat the damn gummy it’s only like 3 😂😂😂
we're waiting for that toothpaste review, mark
6:33 HE DID THE CRUNCHY CAT THING WITH THE CRUNCHY CRUNCH LOOOOOK
Mark's face when he found his "melody legs" was wonderful. Like a child on Christmas morning.
Not 2 nipple gang!!
As a Finnish person this is fun to watch because we have so many salty liquorice which is made out of ammonium chloride, and that's best salty liquorice. We also made something similar as the hokey powder in my chemistry glass in junior high.
2:52 icelandic 4:18 not 6:42 icelandic 9:00 not 11:31 icelandic 13:14 not 15:00 not 18:00 not 20:16 not 21:52 not 23:19 not 24:31 icelandic 25:52 icelandic 28:29 not 31:15 icelandic 33:51 not 35:26 icelandic 36:28 not 37:44 not 40:24 not 42:07 icelandic 45:38 not  Even though these candies are sold in Iceland, as an icelander, I can tell you in order which ones are icelandic and which ones are not:^
Was that Spencer in the background at the end with chica and Henry??
I can't help but wonder if Mark will make any more try not to laugh videos. I remember subscribing after TNTL challenge # 5 to see more of him losing, they made me a fan
Döflar actually means demons lol
4:42 I *really* thought mark was going for "my grandma... is dead!"
Markiplier and Kiano Ruiz is the same person
Mark how green is iceland😂😂😂
was that Ethan's dog Spencer at 41:21 ?
2:10 ah yes short an quick huh, retention time *looks at the rest of the 40min video*
The whistle every time he got a candy is genius 😂
So many Ukrainians will gladly send you our food 😭😭😭
I wish you would try Ukrainian candy 😭😭😭
Hockey pulver is not Icelandic
Hockey pulver is not Icelandic
That HAS to be Lixian screaming at 25:06 you can't convince me otherwise
Hey markiplier I have been a big big fan ever since at least 2016 I watched your videos on various accounts and I have a request IF YOU WANT TO Could you play some resident evil 4? I played it it’s quite fun-Ted
The first candy he ate is icelandic and the name translates to Christmas cat because there is a evil Christmas cat in iceland and if you are bad he will eat you or whatever also I am icelandic and It's will be entertaining listening how he reads the candy names
I love the little tune
21:41 I got three,one at the sole of my right foot dead center 😂
PewDiePie would be so disappointed
The moment he said enter my mind "E (Reverb)" popped in mine
And the second one is the best
You know Mark, I'm inside your mind and... all I can see is *pain* Like if pain had a physical form, that's what I'm seeing... Is there something you wanna tell us? Maybe a fetish you wanna share?
cool jacket
Their reaction the salt ones are my favorite lol
Would you try Turkish snacks? 🇹🇷
I love how amy’s in the background and no one can see her unless she wants to be seen.
Oh sweet summer child youre not eating salt, its salmiak, that special licorice flavour, americans/ppl not used to it always call it salty but its not. Prob hundreds of ppl already said all this in the comments, but im adding my voice to the chorus. Good video tho 😄
the grandma candy literally has the swedish flag marked on it markkkkk :')
I need mark to eat candy from The Netherlands.
I love the pinballs, idk if they are icelandic or not but theyre in the uk too. So tasty, yum yum in my tum
Hey, may i have 20 dollars? I really need it for my school's field trip. You see my field trip costs 25 dollars and my mother is already working hard alone to support us so i dont want to bother her. I'm really desperate for that 20 dollars because i might fail if i dont join the field trip
Is no one going to question what tf was in the chocolate-covered licorice towards the end!?????????????????
So....uhm....huh?
Marks encounter with salmiac was the best thing 😆 Also as a dane when he said our stuff wasnt as sweet, i think it really shows how much sugar america allows in its foods.
hey mark drop the candy and go 🔪🤣
you look like a pirate
the first snack that mark shows reminds me of choco mucho  brand they look the same
As a Scandinavian it really hurts when Mark misplace the candies 😂
My main takeaways are these:  Mark needs to do more of these Iceland loves licorice Volcanos aren't real
13:13 17:59
The first candy is basically a Picnic lol (Picnic is a chocolate from australia :))
The beginning had me cracking TF UP😂😂😂😂😂😂
you were right that was the swedish flag on the second one lol
The whistle candy had me in tears; his joy/goofy enthusiasm was such a mood
Could you quit the melody pop whistle!? You're disturbing my cat!
Mark put the tyrkisk peber in vodka and wait for it to dissolve. Dont drink it yourself, I dont want you to die, please make it a dare or something for someone who Can tolerante it. We use it like that for shots in Denmark 👌
Mark ending the video with him connoisseuring the licorice reminds me of the XKCD where two people are locked in a box for a year with 500 still frames of Joe Biden eating a sandwich and they're arguing over which ones are better
laufey is icelandic can we get a laufey & markiplier collab?
For a second I thought the fly was a tiiiiiiiiiny Lunky
“That’s just a theory! A FOOD THEORY!!!”           …who wants to tell him… 😐
toot sweets from chidi chidi bang bang
licorice
just want to point out that the " þ" is called a thorn and it makes a "th" noise
The last one is gorment licorice made in Denmark
6:03 Felix (Pewds) would be very offended 😂
While Icelandic candy is known for their licorice. I highly suggest a much more pleasant experience from Turkish candies. Not only is their chocolate smooth. But they also have Turkish delights like the ones from Narnia.
great review, thanks mark!
The more Mark embraces the Korean part of his family the more Korean he looks
The angles 😂
We have won Mark into the Lakrids family 😂
Mark, I have these Asian salt-lemon candies at home. Do they sound familiar to you? I think they are Korean.
Play vanish
I finally found someone who eats popcorn the way I do. Im glad I'm not alone!
Most gummies are made from gelatin which is made from collagen. Very few gummy products are entirely made from sugar.
I may be hypnotized by the bandana, but this video made me think about how much Mark reminds me of Johnny Depp
“Cats have been around in Iceland for centuries, or since Iceland was settled in 870” What I found from google
about the paste bubble gum,I'm from greece, not iceland lol but we have this kind of thing too, not sure if its the EXACT same brand cause...its been years since i've had it or paid attention to it but size and colors all fit. Anyway, pretty sure its supposed to have a seal and the color changed cause either that mixed with someone's saliva or because of air exposure, so im glad mark dipped out of that one but its a pity he didnt get to try it cause i have rl fond memories of it as a kid
Mark why did you choose to wear such distracting clothing
At 33:10 Mark talking about how he eats is relieving to know I'm not alone. I also love to eat lime salt
i love how he uses , instead of . when giving half-values. something that i learned when i went to iceland as well!
Liking this pirate style we've got going here
I dig that he has a pirate vibe going on
as a tyrkisk peber lover I have to defend it by saying that mark is overreacting and its not that bad!! also ur not supposed to chew
Being Icelandic myself, I give Mark a lot of credit for even just trying to pronounce the names. Since Icelandic is one of the hardest languages. 😂
half of these are old people candy. Something I´d find my grandpa munching on☠☠
*Me eating the nipple candy as I watch this.
Wait am I missing something why was Spencer at Mark's house? Isn't that Ethan's dog??
my cats started freaking out when he played the whistle loll
this vid made me realize mark kinda looks like johnny depp and keanu reeves merged into one
The candy theme song sounds like the piccolo solo from Stars and Stripes Forever
I missed the review videos so much
this turned from a goofy cool video to mark's licorice hell
Like this comment if you want to see Markiplier play ManEater
Oh !! We have maoam's here in romania !!! They are so fucking good
What did mark mean about chicas legs?
Mark with a headband looks like Che Guevara from Baki
Haha the djöflar are a common thing in the nordics i believe, in finland we call them noitapilli(s) which means witch whistle(s).
The fact that theres a swedish flag an the bag says from Gränna is so funny i feel bad for him. Love that candy so much
Haha tyrkisk peber was originally invented in Denmark but it's now a Finnish product. I love it, the brown ones are the best.
32:40 the white powder is pure ammonium chloride, aka salmiakki
What happened to the iron lung movie?
I have no clue what makes me sit through 50 minutes of a middle aged man eating candy, but here I am.
Come to India and review Indian candies it would probably be the most hilarious review ever 😂😂
Mark describing his mind as a void Me: that makes sense he likes space a lot.
Mark I want you to know that we do have cats in Iceland.
As an Icelandic person, I adore shark bits
I love these videos  I love them so much
Mark, if you EVER want to get a lot of liquorice you need to go to Finland. I'm half Finnish and my mom lives and breathes liquorice. We always got two candy bags so we could separate our sweet and suger covered candy from her salty liquorice.
AYOOOOO THE FAZER ONE (a finnish candy company) ONE IS FINNISH🎉
Do denmark next 🇩🇰
🧀
12:30 this song is giving me flashbacks
감초 싫어...
Bro. I live there…
I have never seen that jerry can gum in the UK. Not once in any shop so idk if that's a southern UK thing or Scotland? Or even Irish but I have never seen that thing...I want it though
The problem that's I'm from iceland,  And Most of our candies are not that much good, it's pretty good but not that much
I think Mark would probably love candy from Brazil lol.
the tubble bubble thing is supposed to be seals lmao
someone needs to add a scoreboard for us. cause i'm sure not. for example  Candy 1: CORRECT Iceland. 5:00 Candy 2: INCORRECT Not Iceland. 5:35
The first candy you tasted Jólaköttur the cat should be based of the evil cat that is called The Yule cat the owner of the cat is named Grýla the ogress that haunts iceland with every christmas eve she comes out and kidnaps bad children and takes them back home to eat its a huge folklore around iceland so most of the candy is produced in iceland but comes from asian or african places
Letss gooo icelandic candy reaching markiplier
Me, a native speaker of Greek & English with no association to the Nordic countries whatsoever: Bro, that's clearly not the Icelandic language, though 💀
So are we gonna get a pal world smash or pass video soon or.... lol
Mark is being consumed by the same thing that is slowly consuming Michael from Vsauce
Hjartlig från Granna is Swedish, and the lambs head is a Norwegian dish, but Icelanders are mainly descended from Norwegians who didn’t want to go around pillaging during the Viking ages.
Next up is Finland
This video has made my morning. 🤣🤣
He in pirate mode
Fazer is a finnish company
Someone *PLEASE* make a full song from Mark's whistle candy
Hey, you should try Swedish candy next!!! Btw, the second candy was actually swedish, you were right from the start.
I ACTUALLY **WANT** to try that hell of the salty candy you have there
37:48 DID SOMEONE SAY TURKISH??? AAUUUUUUUU 🐺🐺🐺 THERE IS NO TURKISH FLAG OPTION, I DUNNO WHYY!!! AAAUUU
i loved is
closed my eyes and actually went 3 layers in Mark's mind, i played the video again and pretty accurate editing i'd say
REVIEWS R BACK UAUAYAYAYYA
I can’t believe he saw the Swedish flag, thought it was probably the Swedish flag, and proceeded to go with his first answer 😂
ooooookey, icelandic person here,   1. JólaKöttur - Christmas Cat - 100% icelandic.  2. Granna - Not icelandic.. is swedish. 3. Trítlar - "Small persons" - 100% icelandic but is based on gummy bears and other similarly popular candy. 4. Sneaky bubbledust - absolutely not icelandic in any way shape or form. 5. Stjörnu Rúlla - Star Roll - 100% icelandic, one of the most popular Liquorice candy in iceland. 6. mintubrjóstsykur -  mint hard candy - well, that one looks to be homemade. probably 100% icelandic. (haven't seen that brand) 7. Tyrkish pepper - Lakkrís Brjóstsykur - absolutely not icelandic BUT consumed in large amounts. (allmost made me angry with that one XD) 8. flautu sleikjó - Flute lollipop - Not icelandic.. but we enjoy it in that same way when we are kids.. :P 9. Sveppir - mushroom candy - absolutely not icelandic.... your knowledge in flags is starting to concern me... (same manifacturer as no. 2) 10. Hockey Pulver - Not icelandic. absolutely not. Liquorice cocaine dust :P  11. Maoam - Not icelandic... your tour guide should be fired.... 12. Súper Sett - Super Set - 100% icelandic! finally.. new product. but based on old candy. 13. Opal - well, this is part of old candy here in iceland, but this one is a new product. (no icelandic person eats that) 14. bismarch hard candy - that particular bag is made here, but i dont think it's from here. 15. Djöflar - Devils - filled candy, not that good.... 16. tubble gum... not icelandic.. i say again, fire your tour guide. 17. Risa Þristur - Giant Three - Icelandic 100% and very popular candy. 18. Skole Kridd - Krít - popular candy but not icelandic. 19. Tyrkish pepper - that thing is not! icelandic. absolutely NOT! 20. Frisia - 100% not icelandic. disgusting thing. 21. lakkrírör - You SHOULD be drinking "Appelsín" with that.. 100% icelandic. 22. pepper coated Liquorice - Icelandic.. but yeah..   in conclusion, you bought tourist candy's and nothing actually else. hit me up if you want real icelandic candy. this selection was horrible... and hard (and funny) to watch.
Mark's look at the begging reminded me of Keanu Reeves...Idk why
Hockey Pulver is not islandic it is norwegian just so you know :)
Mark's jacket is bomb🔥
"Plane, Air, Sky TOWERS!?"
39:18 Did I just hear Arabic?
Loved the Darkaplier shout out at the beginning
I tuned out of life cause of covid. When did mark become Captain Jack Sparrow lite?   I don't hate it he feels more alive than i remember.
You should have tried the liquid gum it's the best gum that I've had in my entire life and the cap is supposed to be like that
Mr. Markiplier one day ima be a movie director. I wish I could see you as one of these people
as someone named Melody, the part at 18:00 was.... interesting to say the least lol
10:15 I seriously hope he knows that any food made in the states is known to be worse in every way than the food made in Europe lmao
Grew up with melody pops in aus
I saw the thumbnail and click and also under the impression Mark gonna play some MGS3..   Then I look at the title....
If you like gum, might I recommend one of my personal favourites, Big league Chew (shredded chewing gum)! Flavours last better than others, take as much or as little as you want, great texture too!
You’d be surprised how common it is for people to ask for the flavocol in a cup
I'd like to try those Lakrios Rulow chocolate licorice balls.
Do you know how many people could be this entertaining while reviewing candy most of us have never had for nearly an hour by himself?  One. And his name is Markiplier.
Best intro on YouTube
Not a fan of Athletic Lite. More of a Clausthaler guy, myself.
I want to edit like Lixian man…
26:40 I lovveee the gradual disgust he developed 😂😂😂
Please use the candy slide whistle tune in future videos😂
Did anyone else notice the cockroach hanging upside down in his nostril??
Because of the licorice straw, I had to look up if licorice beer has been invented yet. It has been.
Whats the deal with all the salty candy in europe and nordic areas?
According to mostly Wikipedia, Ammonium Chloride is a type of salt made of nitrogen and ammonia (the hazardous gas) found in volcanic vents or synthesized. It's apparently 5% acid and used in some batteries. So something tells me Mark was not exaggerating.
Jack Sparrow? Is that you?
Love ts man sm always have m cracking me up 😂
I'm curious when Amy and Mark got a third dog.
I just wanna know what brand Marks headband
Mark playing that whistle perfectly is now my brother's ringtone and it hear it every 5 mins. Beautiful
I love the rapid descent from excited to disgusted for the Opal candy! It's so funny!
It's a jerry can because it can not only transport petrol but diesel.
I sometimes lose interest in a video the moment I click on it so I finally founded something that can keep it
Oh mark you forgot about Skyflgaaardd and Plusfencluben
I hate licorice, and I lived in Iceland. It's like a candy desert for me.
Hi
I love how people are ranting about how some of the candy not being Icelandic yet he literally said he got it in Iceland and said he didn’t know if it was authentic at the start of the video and even asked if it was authentic and was told it was so like don’t give out to him. Just watch the video like
Omg I’ve had the bubble dust in America somewhere between ’03 and ‘05 I’ve also had the slide whistle candy and mark playing it unlocked a core memory 😂
BUBBLEJUG!!!!!! Holy 90’s
Weird grape flavor mint
I'm dreading the "I don't want that in me anymore" being used as a sound in TikToks... o_0
i could be wrong but i think the tounge painter things are german?? idk, ive had them before tho
Please do more videos like this 😊
Ok I no that I haven't been watching markiplier recently but when did start dressing pirate like
Why so much salt and liquorice?  It's cold and nothing grows so liquorice to the rescue! As for the salt, it keeps meat from rotting
Random idea at the end of every candy review videipo you put all of the candy into a belendewr and blend it.
Y’all did a whole video about Icelandic candy and I haven’t heard a single Bjork reference. Shameful. I’m probably ten minutes in tho
9 of these items were Icelandic lol, rest was from Sweden and the rest of the nordic countries.
OMG Mark I love your horror videos!! I love all your videos ❤❤
When I stayed in Iceland, every candy somehow had salted licorice in it. As a licorice hater, the most offensive was hidden and coated in chocolate. The betrayal I felt as soon as I bit into it…
Markiplier, with a lot of fans, and a lot of simps, infinite possibilities, limited power. The simps or fans can be toxic as all get out, but they will never ruin anyons opinion on Markiplier. That is the art of this, how one can be liked and not disliked because they may remind anyone of someone bad who enjoys Markiplier as well
He does not know about the cats of Reykjavík 😮
43:43 I KNEW IT I KNEW IT THANK YOU MARK
i feel bad for mark sometimes because in that cam at 44:38 you can see the bags under his eyes and how much he has been making content for us
16:05 had me laughing for a good 6 minutes straight
Is Markiplier my mother?!?!?!?!?
No cats in Iceland. There is a litteral cat cafe😂😂😂
from 14:58 to 15:10 i don't know why but it just sounds good to hear and i don't know why???!
Someone has to play through the fire and flames on that candy whistle 😂
23:14 one time I ate ammonium chloride it wasn’t good
Always nice to see a new taste test vid but my misophonia hated it😂
The one at 13:47 was actually known at my school as the “teeth breaker candy”, since there have been around 4 kids who broke their tooth from eating that lmao
the unidentifyible flavor is "Salmiak" and it taste amazinnnnnggg
my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
Try danish candy
I just love that the second candy package literally has a Swedish flag on it😆
the whistle never stops being funny, like really fucking funny
Would be nice if Mark tried some from Estonia. I, mean he would get a whole lot of chocolate.
gotta say lixian makes this so entertaining
They don't have moam in America 😮 i must say am surprised by that
Not even 2 minutes in & Markiplier has me trapped 3 layers deep within his Infinite Void
All this time I thought mark and Amy were broken up
Man.. lots of Swedish and Finnish stuff in a supposedly "icelandic" candy review xD Maybe iceland just doesn't have too much candy production.. so they import most of this stuff. Aside from that, Mark eating tons of trash-quality liquorice followed by actually good liquorice and then exclaiming that it's "fantastic" in comparison is just a big ol' DUH from any scandinavian :P To all you americans trying this thing.. yes.. of course there is soooo much bad (i.e. "false") liquorice going around, for which you have to have a specific palette to enjoy. However, there IS good liquorice out there. You just have to identify it. The pricetag is a pretty good tell!!
Tyrkisk peber is from finland
46:25 Insert the critic scene from ratatouille
slowly you'll become a review channel lmao
can u review Indonesian candy Mark?
Markiplier has complained that when he eats sour he wanted it to hit him with the taste  and now that he has got what he wanted... it feels strange to see his reaction
As a finnish individual, this video is pain as in pronunciation and judging.
that jingle needs to be in every video from now on
Mmmm volcanic ash candy....😅
Funny how the only word Mark can think of to describe the flavour of Tyrkisk Peber is "chemical". It is actually flavoured with Ammonium Chloride aka Salmiac, and is kinda unsafe in large doses. However Danes, as well as many other Nordic countries love the taste of salmiac licoriche.
He should try Mexican candy he would love it
in the words of arin handsome MOAAAAAAAAR! of these
Greetings from the art museum receptionist in akureyri. Remember seeing you walk in and thinking "wow he looks just like markiplier" and then when you walked up to the desk and started talking I had to do a mental double take of "holy shit it is him" so I apologies for the few seconds of slack jawed silence as my brain rebooted. Two notes on the video itself first the Þ from the risa þristur is pronounced like the th in thor and second I think it's funny your least favourite candy's name translates to devils.
i dont know what IT is, MARK. someone help me, im under de wadther, because its me Dickstarr123
We have tht powdered gum here too
watching Mark's brain unfold mixed with the editing (Lixian) and back in forth with the crew (Amy) is just...I miss these videos....
Try German candy its Nuts
38:28 shows the regret😂😂
Menurut buku TATANG SUTARMA....
Man it's been so long since I've seen Mark upload he must be really busy with whatever is left iron lung Edit: mark is rocking the Johnny depp bandana look
THE SECOND IS SWEDISH it basically says "heartly from gränna" gränna is a place in sweden
I know lort Mark.... Morton
That stuff what you hated so much on those two candys is called "salmiac"; its popular in nordic countries and from my own experience in germany, because I live there
I'm still in Markiplier's mind, please help
1st candy: From Iceland 2nd candy: Not from Iceland 3d candy: From Iceland 4th candy: Not from Iceland 5th candy: From Iceland 6th candy: From Iceland 7th candy: Didin’t see the package so idk 8th candy: Not from Iceland 9th candy: Not from Iceland 10th candy: Not from Iceland 11th candy: Not from Iceland 12th candy: Not from Iceland 13th candy: From Iceland 14th candy: From Iceland 15th candy: again idk didint see the package 16th candy: From Iceland 17th candy: Not from Iceland 18th candy: From Iceland 19th candy: Not from Iceland 20th candy: Not from Iceland 21st candy: Not from Iceland 22nd candy: From Iceland 23d candy: Not from Iceland  I’m from Iceland so this should all mostly be correct.
Oooh, candy museum sounds awesome!!!
Yay I’m special
Do brazilian candy next
...Is it like that panda molases liquorice that's really good?
If the candy item doesn't make sense: It's probably icelandic. probably.
40:38 oh no, oh no
Yeah thst 'spice' stuff is disgusting. We bought some mango candies in Mexico, boy were we disappointed.... 38:47
Skole kridt is danish. School chalk is the translation
Oh good, Amy still exists. :)
_"Is that a nipple?"_ =  instant sub.
Would've been too painful if Mark put those pinballs in Icelandic
Is wrong about the volcano. Getting upset about something before it happens is ridiculous.
It has been a while since we last got a test.
41:40 Someone PLEASE tell me what song this is. It's gonna bug me for a solid week if I don't find out bc I DO recognise it, I just don't know what it is 😭😭
I'm 30 seconds in and i already feel sorry for Lixian editing this! Lixian you got this, you are the real one!
I KNEW i spotted spencer doggy in the background 😅 confirmed right at the end 😂
I love Lixians editing, made the whole video hilarious
Licourice is actually from Finland and as a finn i love it Its the best thing ever
it not a bad look but, Mark is starting to look like a half Korean Jack Sparrow.
Man, my Icelandic heart loves seeing this video but man is he  putting a lot of non Icelandic  candy in the Icelandic category and Icelandic in the non icelandic one.
the þ is pronounced like the th
21:25 FINALLY I CAN EAT PCKING PEANUTS
why was there so much licorice 😭
mark should do more reviews
ammonium chloride is made to be strong, so you are right. very salty
"I dont want that in me anymore" broke me LMAO!
Let's never talk about a pot hole because the next day someone could fall down one.
Try greek candy
Mark started the video by saying enter "my mind", which means this is what normally goes on in his mind throughout the day.😂
Love how tiny swedish mushrooms gets interpreted as being "nipples"
It PAINS me to hear that you said ThRe aR nO CatS iN iCelaND
Hann borðar stjörnurúllu kolvitlaust
You got on the Icelandic news radio station for this.
I hope he uses that same candy transition noise for any future candy related videos
The immediate cringe after saying "yolo" is so real
0:08 Mark: "I want you to enter my mind" Me: "OH PLEASE GOD NO!"
try Romanian sweets
It's not Icelandic, it's licorice
Hehe gum be rubber and than sand
4:42 "not my Grandma, My grandma...  ...is korean."  That was a relief to hear, but why did you have to make that suspencefull pause right there

Finally!!! Yes!!! More of these please!!! More IRL vids, they feel way more involved!!
i thought chemicals in the food was a uniquely american thing
Marks 1000 yard stare is priceless
Is this secretly an asmr video lol
Mrkiplier when you gonna play resident evil 4 remake? You did play separate ways of Ada Wong side, it's soon be time for you to play the main story. I really want to see you play resident evil 4 remake.
Funny thing about Scandinavia and salt is that we consume so much salt that scandinavian food products usually have more salt inserted into them than the average food item in the rest of the world. Probably has something to do with early nordics exploring the shoreline, finding and licking salt rocks and then it all snowballed from there.
Risa þristur actually says Risa Thristur  The letter þ (thorn) is pronounced th, it was also used in English before the war they had with the normans, the reason why they changed it is when the normans won they had difficulty pronouncing þ (thorn) so they changed it to th
Wait so red vine/twizzler is not licorice?! Then what is licorice and what does it taste like?
why didn’t they get this man some scissors or something to open up the candy
second one is from sweden, and the one you ate that was really salty isnt even the worst there is a new one out that is the saltiest licorice in the world.
Ouff you should have gotten a local to help pick out Icelandic candy. Almost none of the products you tried in this video are Icelandic and we do have stuff that is not just licorice. :P
Me while watching the video: "Are there cats in Iceland?" Google : "Cats have been around in Iceland for centuries" I've been deceived.
I love mints, I have a fkn spooky obsession with mints😅shhh☺️🥹
Mark (Gollum voice): “What the Fuck?” 31:43
Aw man, Melody Pops, thats a blast from the past - they were the best candy in the 90's when i was a kid. But I'm also Australian so yeah, def not Icelandic lol
The flavor is "simultaneously fascinating and... abusive." Ammonium chloride is a slightly toxic chemical most notably found in "salmiak," a salt licorice candy, which is popular in northern Europe.
I think Mark just took everything out of the liquorice aisle lmao
A star crunch wow 😒😞
I was so happy to see Chica and WAS THAT SPENCER?!?!? <3
it’s the screaming candy for me 👌🏻
im only 14 seconds in and its been nearly a month since ive watched a video from you. I see why i loved your videos so much. Idk why you stopped getting reccomended to me. Probally all the political stuff ive been watching about texas and wars all over the world. its lovely to have a break from it. I would say sorry for bringing it up but im not lol. Love you all tho! Stay safe everyone
Feeling like the word "Icelandic" loses its initial definition in this video and just turns into a vibe
I love the whistling omg. I need it as a ringtone now, but on a loop xD
The following day, the candy volcano erupted in a sugary plume. None survived
Him and the welsh twins might just be a golden trio
So that's what it looks like in a 4 million dollar home
Icelandic people love licorice
This was great research for my upcoming trip to Iceland.
From a little bit of info dosnt  Iceland have salt beaches everywhere
I love the occasional face to face review videos, it really ties together the Mark experience.
Play garten of ban ban
Next up I review markiplier
As a person from Finland and having similar candy here, i enjoyed this video way too much. 🤣 Btw that blue and yellow bag of candy is from finland. Or i think it said Fazer in the top corner which is Finnish company. 😁
31:33 - It sounds like he's speaking Simlish XD
Im willing to bet this is authentic, has the swedish flag on the front lol
The one at 37:00 was totally a good and plenty dup XD
sometimes i wish i could see marks reaction of the end edit that gets posted. I feel like he would laugh with us. XD
I want that whistle sound for my phone, lol I think it'd be a great text notification sound
Hey 👋 I lived in Iceland for 4 years before moving out a few months ago so I can tell you a little more about these candies. The Jólaköttur candy bar (based on the Icelandic Christmas cat folktales) is very authentic and you can only find it during the holiday season. The Swedish one, while not Icelandic is still very popular in Iceland. The Trítlar ones are also very authentic and popular. In the summertime they often release a summer edition. Stjörnurúlla (meaning star roll) is also popular, while not the best licorice, it is quite traditional. Turkish Peber: super popular in Nordic countries but it’s from a Finnish company. Anyway that’s pretty much it for the popular ones.   Also, I’m pretty sure he went to Hagkaup to get these.
Mark should make an intro to each video starting with that candy whistle
Watching this as an Icelander is a joy. There's a lot of different candies which come from Europe, a lot of licorice, dark chocolate, mint and salt.  Chocolate covered wafers are really popular. You probably might've seen them in the stores sold as "Lava" bites or bits. Lol.
It’s wild to me that Mark didn’t see any cats in Iceland like they just fucking sit on the side of the road
Spencer?! You're telling me Ethan's there with you and you didn't make him suffer the licorice gauntlet with you?!
Bro is trying so hard not to be racist
what is the jacket? I like it.
Beer? Since when can mark drink again? Is that just a special beer I don't know about that somehow won't wreck him?
I bet money Mark would fell in love with Brazilian candies
Just wanted to let you know cats have been around Iceland ever since it got settled in 870 A.D
Markiplier has a Captain Jack Sparrow look to him😂
Mi cat did not like the candy whistle
I need Mark to try the Japanese salty plum candy
So we don't get to know what items he actually got correct or not?? Where's my cryface emoji when I need it?
I need an audio of him opening up the mints
did mark shit for the entire day after filming this video?
i hated the weird lil bites he takes and the way he holds it a worse review video imo
Spencer?! 41:21
I'm making the whistle between each candy my new notification sound
11:08 Ok Mark.
Omg melody pop! I loved those as a kid!
This is teaching me that Iceland *really* likes Licorish for some reason, lol. I know some of the candy probably isn't from Iceland but majority rules with how much is in there, that they have Licorish in quite a bit of their candies. (I say as someone obviously NOT from Iceland.) I'm glad Mark likes it for his sake because I'd be so upset and spitting out most the stuff, lol. I loved that they stuck to the candy whistle chime between each type like they said they would, lol.
THE REVIEWING IS BACK!!
It was so salty because salmiac is much saltier than sodium chloride.
Bubble gum bottle was a thing here in the states!! I bought that soo much in the 90’s and early 2000’s here in California. It’s still being sold! 😂
37:00 i think its licorice
As a fellow Nordic man, i bet you that most of the candies are Swedish.
my college writing teacher had us watch The Lamb and i still dont know how I feel about it.
Thank You Lixian!
The reason he couldn’t place the Tyrkisk Peber flavor was because of the ammonium chloride powder. An incredibly acquired taste, I’ve heard.
Oh my god, bubble jug!!!! I was obsessed as a kid, ive been searching for years!!!
Try lollies from Australia pleaseeee, also my parents sell that melody pop in our Lolly shop here in Aus haha
That second candy, the hard candy they have those in Japan use to have them when I was little but not sure if Japan or Iceland made it first.
i just now have the thought that I want to see Mark play a version of Captain Jack Sparrow.
I love how lixian adds a scream edit its so funny i love it
did he just call dutch nordic
I missed Markiplier Reviews!!
lambs head... you mean Smalahove ? not icelandic :p
The first time he said "but hey" I immediately thought "that's just a theory" and then he said it and I felt so silly
God his camera lense is so detailed that I can see his pores
The whistle is great lol
NORWAY MENTIONED?!?!?!?!?
I like Mark's new pirate look
These are my favorite kind of videos from mark, gives me nostalgia of unus annus
41:08 im lovin this content
7:27 If that candy starts talking I am grabbing a flamethrower!
man has a religious experience with licorice
The first thing was from iceland
15:04 says turkish pepper in danish xD Danes are super obsessed with chili and liqourice!
Finally he noticed us😭😭❤❤
His face when the haunted mask is brought up is perfect
I can't believe that Mark accidentally revealed that he's gonna be the new host of Food Theory 43:41
LIKE If you want Mark to Review GREEK Candy!
thought he was gonna eat the first candy then blow up
German Candy next?
I kinda wanna take the powder gum and put it into water like Kool-Aid
( But hey ✨️bee pee boo poo✨️- Markiplier 2024 ) Mark properly don't want to se liquorice in a hot while 😂 i was dying the whole time seeing his face lmao
Can we just appreciate the editing and the quality of this video. And love the reviewing videos, i really missed those :))
Next time try Argentinean candy, lets see if you dont die in the process of becoming one with sweetness
Damn mark a lot of space up here there’s a plane and shit
Love the little jingle ~
As an Icelander and a long-time fan, I have to say, I wasn't expecting this lol.
Mark being so busy he is having a crisis on how to start a video
There are so many cats in Iceland. When I went to visit Reykjavik, petting cats was like ... a quarter of my time.
it was such low fruit but the can gong truly got me 45:11 (fixed timestamp bc dumb)
Wait... Airheads are supposed to be spicy??
I missed these
"horribly annoying for everyone around you" Wait until he learns about the Ice-cream with a plastic flute stick in it...
A lot of UFOs here. Oh lemme explain…unidentified flavored object. Also that intro was very meat canyon-esk and I love it.
as a dutch person i love watching Mark experiencing salmiak
HEY MARK IM A HUGE FAN (Sorry if my profile Pic Is my mom, i use her phone cus in mine i cant write comments)  next time please review italian Candy cus in italian and i would love for u to review them. If u Need heres a list of the italian Candy i Remember: Ferrero Rocher, pocket coffee, mon cherry(i dont Remember its name),fruittella,plumcake.  Those are all i Remember! (Sorry for any grammar mistake, the phone has italian autocorrect) youre the best byee
My dogs are from Iceland! They're Icelandic Sheepedogs. The cutest things ever if you look them up.
This video was ready a month ago... They decided to delay the upload once Grindavík (2500 person town) literally erupted...
As a Norwegian/Scandinavian, who has a lot of these candies and/or similar variants in Norway, was cackling like a goblin through the whole video at Mark and Amy's reactions
Dunno about you Scandinavians, but the mint red and white sweets are straight up French Berlingots
25:52 and that kids is how you summon a demon
i cannot stop laughing everytime i hear that slide whistle 😂😂😂
3:00 this candy is named after a Jule/Christmas folktale about a cat owned by a witch of sorts that would come and steal children who didn’t get new clothes on Christmas
Based solely on this video, I, a person raised in the USA who also likes-but-does-not-love liquorice, ordered some of the Lakrids by Bulow chocolate-covered liquorices (the last candy in the video, although not the exact same variety as shown) and... Mark is right, they're incredible. I'm floored. They're SO GOOD. (Also thanks Mark!)
Bro, there’s a volcanic vent right now in Grindavík so you kind of right
Why is nobody talking about how crazy good the quality of the video footage is? Wow!
This made me want mark to do old fashioned English sweets. Cos some of these reminded me of those like the striped ones (like humbugs), the nipple (mushroom)and the flying sorcers with sherbet in them
Love when at the 31:00 minute part Mark does the meme war face
what happened to chica?
9:15 The US has that as well
After the flute candy it was used as a segway for every candy thereafter
Boy I’ve missed these 😂
Reminds me of Estonian milk bars. Those things were amazing
American food safety standards xD xD xD
*swedish flag on packaging* mark: now this is DEFINITELY authentic islandic candy!
I love his jack sparrow loook noe
RIP Blue Opal 2005.
"ITS NIT HARD" *crunch* "you know how I said that wasn't hard-"
It all shares some reassembles to danish candy too, and the 21:20 is not a nipple, but a mushroom. Or maybe it is a nipple, who knows! I’ve always seen them as mushrooms. We have then in white and rosa
im going to guess that its licorice 37:05
As an Icelander myself, so frustrating that he didn't get any of the good Icelandic candies, especially the chocolates.
Mark you’re gonna have high blood pressure if you keep eating that much salt. I have high blood pressure. I used to eat a lot of salt not so much anymore
0:13 "Plane.... Air.... Sky.... Two Buildings..."
As an Icelander, I'd like to ask only one question. How was the weather?
ive had the melody mop my whole childhood, brought back many good old memories :)
Tyrkisk Peber is finnish, Fazer is a finnish brand! TORILLE!!! and its a salmiak candy, not liqourice. best way to enjoy tyrkisk pebers is to put them in to a vodka bottle, let them dissolve in the vodka and you get a delicious Tyrkisk Peber Vodka
Mark, America doesn’t have food after standards really either 😂 the fda allows a certain amount of poop in all our food. It’s just a tolerance they allow
25:02 idk if its my general mood but the added sound effect of the ball dropping made my roommate think im crazy bc it was comedic genius 😭
As a Swedish person the second one is definetly Swedish since the text is in Swedish if u look close
The tube of gum was supposed to be sealed and leave of a soft pink colour (at least the one with the same packaging in the Netherlands) Salmiak is absolutely salty AF, we dutchies seem to like it And the peppermint pillows are also possibly a typical dutch thing, but it may be the way it is pressed that makes it either dutch or icelandic/northern Frisia is something frisian :P so yeah to me I learned it is dutch, but it can be created by the old area of frisia
I've tried the gum in a lil tube at 32:42. It's not bad flavor-wise, but it starts out super soft at first (that's what she said lmao).
0:48 yes
salmiak is so delicious
In nordic countries and in northern europe we have a thing that is the spicier, angrier cousing to licorice. To the unexpecting and inexperienced it might taste like it is straight from saatana and perkele - as we in Finland say. It is basically the raw chemical version of the tamer licorice with some added sugar, and we hecking love it.
skole kridt is a danish candy
WHY MUST EVERYTHING BE LICORICEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
The guy can't admit that he hates liquorice. I hate it, and I do the same faces.
Hey when is u playing poppy playtime 3?
Tyrkisk peber is so good, watching u eat it makes me want some lmao
Much love to the Lovely Lixian who is well, Watching a Recording of Mark Mumbling for 2-4 Hours and cuts it down for us Viewers to a 10-20 or maybe 30 minutes at most Video that is full of the Funny Bits that Mark Spouted...  And Plus the SFX they put on the vid. ❤ ❤ ❤
First one looks like chokito from Brazil
Haha 😂yes it is the Swedish flag greetings from Sweden
It's so painful seeing him put the classic icelandic sweets on the "NON Icelandic" side... General rule: If it's a mix of chocolate and liquorice and or somewhat salty then it's probably icelandic. Iceland loves liquorice
The second is so Swedish, most Swedish thing ever. Even has the flag right on it.
18:37 shut down my pc yesterday  tinking of nothing bad ...i just got home from work.. started my pc.. and see Mark doing this.. i just have to say.. my brain can relate..
I was really feeling bad today mentally but this video just swept me out of my slump thank you so much💙
SUOMI SUOMI MAINITTU FAZER!!!! TORILLA TAVATAAN!!!!🎉🎉🎉 And now that tradition is out the way i have never enjoyed a video more than mark torturing  himself with finnish candy 😂😂😂
Dude we need more Markiplier makes! It's been to long!

Mark with all his heart and blood and other medical issues: "Imma eat black licorice candies today" Science news: "Black Licorice causes heart and blood pressure problems in men"
I feel like the first candy is similar to a 100 grand here in the states.
you should do motivational videos sometimes. <3
Please try south africa sweets🙏🙏
Finally we have Food videos again :3!
23:18 as a brit, WE LOVE PINBALLS
Try stuff from South Africa, please, I just want my country to ne noticed.
Gods brought us a Markiplier candy review. It's beautiful.
like half of these are norwegian lmao
Omg I love Iceland, and you Mark so this is super cool! I hope I can go to Iceland soon someday
Loved seeing Spencer there with Henry and Chica but also, I lost it at "you know me, big dick money bags" omfg ☠️☠️☠️
Turkish pepper is from Fazer that is a Finnish brand. We love those here, there's even Turkish pepper alcohol 😂❤🇫🇮
Me being Icelandic owning a cat😭
Me when Mark was ALMOST going to put Fazer, a Finnish brand to the "Icelandic" section: No, NOOOO no, don't. Don't do it. And then the relief of him being like "Nah it's not Icelandic"
TransGayLand🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈🇮🇸*

Did mark just eat smelling salts?
Love Tyrkisk peber ❤
Idk why but whenever there's a video or any piece of media that mentions icelandic I get so happy and excited because it's like nobody ever talks about iceland
went to iceland last year, got these amazing apple flavoured hard candy in a tin, genuinely would be a partial reason for me to go back there
I feel like this went from being a review to being an asmr of mark chewing and it’s literally my #1 pet peeve in the entire universe lol
mark the lolipop is not iceladic
The amount of salmiakki aka salty liquorice in this video is hilarious, poor Mark 😂
I’m so glad solid snake was able to bring me this video
hey mark! you should definitely try argentinian candy, you won't regret the alfajores 🇦🇷
I just realized you're a half Asian Marki! Because you have hooded eyes just like me 😊
please dont buy it thats too much money 😭😭
I could escape the maze of your mind
The fazer candy is from Finland and the undescribable thing in it is salmiak
4:39 Its legit a swedish flag on the cover. it says "heartly good from grenna". good try tho.
Here’s a Wikipedia article for ya:  Ammonium chloride is an inorganic chemical compound with the chemical formula NH4Cl, also written as [NH4]Cl. It is an ammonium salt of hydrogen chloride. It consists of ammonium cations [NH4]+ and chloride anions Cl−. It is a white crystalline salt that is highly soluble in water. Solutions of ammonium chloride are mildly acidic. In its naturally occurring mineralogic form, it is known as sal ammoniac. The mineral is commonly formed on burning coal dumps from condensation of coal-derived gases. It is also found around some types of volcanic vents. It is mainly used as fertilizer and a flavouring agent in some types of liquorice. It is a product of the reaction of hydrochloric acid and ammonia.  Since Iceland is riddled with volcanoes, it wouldn’t be surprised if they mine the salt and clarify it for human consumption in these candies. My guess, if it says it has ammonium chloride, it’s 90% likely that it’s Icelandic.
Who knew the Icelandic loved licorice so much. I hate licorice so I'd probably be like my mom who hates maple syrup (I'm Canadian)
essence of chocolate
Licorice has numbing characteristics. There's no way you could fully enjoy so many different ones in a row. Mark's tastebuds have been put to sleep
I love how theres a swedish flag and he thinks its icelandic
The inside of the Turkish pebber thing is salmiak, it’s salty licorice of some sort apparently
Licorice roots are native to Scandinavia and spread by the Vikings
Those Tyrkisk Peber candies are made by Fazer in Finland and I LOVE the colorful ones! Especially if you melt them into vodka it makes a really great shot to drink! (it tastes like fruit candy with a little bit of licorice and especially the licorice hides the strong taste of vodka really well) I call it the Monster shot, but some people also call it Nipple, Fruit shot or HotShot (Hottishotti) 😄
I'm ngl I thought mark was going to say .... Plane, Sky.... scraper lol
The very first candy he tries reminds me SO much of a lunchbar here in South Africa
Americans STRONGLY associate ammonia with urine and cleaning supplies. I have enjoyed candy from around the world, but the Icelandic assertion that licorice is better with ammonia salts truly puzzles me. I love licorice. I enjoy salted licorice. Regular salted licorice is tasty. The ammonia chloride is how you ruin a good candy every time
0:21 Who cares... It's not like it was your fault. Why does everyone overthink everything these days?....
Pov: mark Bad- iceland Ok/good- not iceland
According to wikipedia, Ammonium chloride is an inorganic chemical compound with the chemical formula NH 4Cl, also written as [NH 4]Cl. It is an ammonium salt of hydrogen chloride.  (yes this was copied from wikipedia except for according to wikipedia)  Apparently used to make dry batteries and fertilizer.
Im from the netherlands and i heard salmiak. Never laughed so much EVER we have so much salmiak candy😂😂 you get used to it after a while
Nordic chocolate is really good fite me.
omgggg i haven't seen a melody pop in years!!!! I used to get one after going to the doctor's as a kid cause they sold them right at the tills at the pharmacy
A chika and henry cam will always be appreciated <3
Mark in Sweden: "Wow, there's so much Icelandic candy here"
I am Icelandic, and I forgive you. Yes we have cats.
Fun fact about "djöflar" the super salty one that you tasted is that djöflar means devils and it got it's name from the factory workers cursing it whilst making it and calling it devilish.
hello everybody my name is welcome
23:28 Maoam are the best!! They’re German candy
Don’t worry about valcano attacks, they’ll never come from underneath your bed.
darkiplier the pirate
I wana see that haunted mask
I missed this kind of videos
markiplier is going bald.
"They dont have american food safety standards" is a very very good thing
i have a question, what does he means about chika's legs im so confused
I grew up with those melody pops, in America, and when Mark started I said "you gotta get it wet first"  and immediately regretted it.  I was right though.
Y'all Americans and your inability to appreciate the deliciousness of TRUE salty liquorice smh AND can't believe the christmas cat was put in 'not-Icelandic' :'c  /j  Watching this as an Icelander has made me cry-laugh, thank you XD It's hilarious how different taste buds can be, I will literally get a big canister of hockey pulver and practically drink it (listen...is good), also djöflar (the extremely salty thing aptly named 'demons' lmao) and tyrkist peber just, yes, give me the entire bag, if you ever come to Iceland again you should try the tyrkist peber ice cream! Also maybe djúpur, those are really nice choc-covered liquorice, and maybe try an actual good flavor of Opal... also maybe some less liquorice-y things like staur or rís buff, góa karamellur, hraun, hlaup eðlur, nóakropp, bananastangir... and y'know writing this I am realising most Icelandic candy does involve liquorice or chocolate or both... never actually thought about that before... Anyway, amazing video, made me happy, hope you come visit again~
Gotta love how the first item, which is ICELANDIC for "The Christmas Cat", was the first one he decided WASN'T from Iceland. COME ON, MARK, IT'S THE TIM TAMS ALL OVER AGAIN! 29:46 I don't think I could've handled you also claiming humbugs were Icelandic - turns out as popular as they are worldwide, those are french! (then at 31:05) OH FFS MARK!
maoams are the goat (from the uk!)

( and btw the Cat you see is the logo for the candy company) 16. Tubble gum is Not Icelandic 17.Risa Þristur is Icelandic 18.Skole Kridt, the Candy coated licorice is from Denmark 19.

"There’s not such thing as volcanoes"  - Mark 2024/2025
The gas can of bubble dust is 100% sold in America too.
Chica was all around the best part of this video, *change my mind*
PLEASE TRY INDIAN SNACKS🟠⚪🟢
mark, please, you gotta do swedish candy!!! real, authentic, swedish candy!!! please I beg of you, it will be hilarious!!!
Idk but as an Australian, I was just shocked that Mark had never tried the whistle pop before cause that lollie is such a childhood memory and just figured everyone had tried them at some point before😂
Tyrkisk peber- (Turkish pepper) is Finnish😂
I want him to do Aussie candies. Also someone needs to send him a Darrell Lea box
I see Mark is in his "hatless Jack Sparrow" period when it comes to his hairdo
Me as a Dane when he said Dutch after the other Nordic countries😃😃😃😃😃
at some point I just stopped guessing the flavors and assumed it was going to always be licorice and salt. 😂   Edit: I left this comment before 36:38 lol
Anybody who has grown up with the whistle candy like me say "I" in the replies
the fact that a volcano erupted a few days before this is hilarious xD
Wouldnt the first one be like (Yole- ah-coat jr.)? Because like Nordic descending languages?
Mark do u have ethins dog
Hello to everyone who is waiting for help wanted 2 part 16
Are you going to play poppy play time?  Please play poppy playtime
Dislexia is quite annoying
ÍSLAND RHAAAA
10:14 as if the american food safety standards weren't the lowest in the western world... lol.
Mark, we love you, one word ... scissors.  lol
00:20 did anyone else waited for 2 building
This has been great and I’ve only made it so far to the nipple candy 🤣 and receiving the whistle tune after every review and I’m dying 😂
If Mark looked at the packet for the whistle lollipop, it actually has a little music sheet on the inside.
We have that salty licorice here in Germany too and it tastes so baaaaad. I feel you guys it’s really REALLY salty 😭
Flames could be a Tabasco like flavor which ive always tasted as chemical like
Remember to try a chocolate bar called "Draumur" next time
Powdered Gum is a Pre-2000”s thing in Alaska during the time when new shit hitting the stores was weeks behind the rest of the Lower 48
38:27 that is the funniest shit ive ever seen, "i have have good news......*makes face of disgust*......i have bad news"
I love you Markiplier
I thought the chocolate licorice balls where olives 😭
Icelandic and Russian are two of the hardest languages I've ever learned, but I think Russian was still easier than Icelandic.That made the attempted pronunciation even funnier when combined with the facial expressions. One of my favorite random videos.
please try filipino candy next please❤❤❤❤
Been waiting for the next Mark review. Finally. What I need.
the close-up camera has me dying 😭😭😭
Watching Mark eat candy he just doesn't like is quite entertaining, thank you for your suffering
Havent seen one of these Review Food videos since (YOUR DEAD TO ME) Video❤️ I think he should Start opening Pokemon cards ;)
o look Mark Stonie
Ammonium chloride is a slightly toxic chemical most notably found in salt licorice candy. The more you know!
Mark finding out what salmiac is hillarius
In scandinavia, Students put turkish pebber into a vodka bottle and let it disolve for a week and than do (in my opinion) discusting shots
Am I the only one who thinks this has some asmr to it? or is it just me..
Do you ever think that Mark forgets he's not on camera sometimes and just turns to empty air to talk to Lixian? I kinda got the vibe in this one that he does that.
38:24 I swear Mark watching you is so relatable for me. I would react the same! 😂I have good news it not blue regsuresish. regretting the eating, I have bad news it is the full same thing as that one was! Me: So relatable! Mark I dont know what you are! It's not hot! Me: oh man.. another relatable thing... X,D
"In the Fass"
Mark saying the turkinpippuri tasted like chemical, it is salmiakki, which is a chemical lol. It's ammonium chloride, which we made in chemistry class once and it is just a white powder.
My cat REALLY hated this part! 19:00 😅
Damn it Mark trim your nose hair   It's really distracting on close ups when its touching your mustache 😂
Also 31:42 is best part
did bro fart on 41:24 😅🤣💀
31:29 the name means Devil
Mark is definitely giving Jack Sparrow vibes here and im loving it!
the jólaköttur candy was from iceland, granna was swedish, trítlar is classic icelandic gummypeople, the jerrycan isnt icelandic but its tasty, stjörnu rúlla is icelandic and disgusting, i dont belive for a second that chocolate and peppermitnt is icelanic its probably danish or norwegian, Tyrkisk peber is danish and explains why its bad, Chupa Chups is spanish, the nipples are swedish, say it with me now hockey pulver is swedish, harrobo and thus maoam are German súper set is very icelandic, opal is icelanic and tasty and mark needs a better opinion on this one, i think the bismark klampers are icelandic because i found an identical candy in another packaging with the same name, djöflar is icelandic and roughly translates to "the devil", tubble gum isnt icelandic not much to say, þristur is one of the best if not the single best icelandic candy ever made and "risa" just means "giant" so its just a "giant þristur" skólakrítar just translates to school chalk and it tastes like chalk, its easily the worst icelandic candy to ever be pulled from the depts of hell from where it came from and i am ashamed to admit its icelandic, its good if you want to roleplay susie from deltarune though, tyrkish peber is still from denmark, frisia is either german or duch, apollo lickerish straw is icelandic, Lakrids by Bülow is danish.
marks lenses coming in clutch
As someone who doesn't have exactly two nipples, thank you for the message Mark. Means a lot
You should 100% review New Zealand candy!
The fact that this is nearly 50 minutes long is wild to me.
Gotta be careful with that much black licorice, it can cause heart issues if you eat like a couple packs in a short time frame (like within 24-28 hours).
0:06 Mark, please take a nap
Dung mark get some sleep there are some bags under your eyes
That grey startin to show on his facial hair
I remember them slide whistle candies from when I was a youngin. But when you really got it my dog's freaked out. But yeah if I remember correctly I played with it for a moment and then I ate the candy 😂
I just watched a grown man try to guess if the food is from an island or not.  I was unsurprisingly entertained. 10/10, would watch again.
Honesty if Mark ever wanted to cash in views he could just live stream Chica and Henry playing for an hour or two 😂
my cat was the Yulecats girlfriend in the newspaper
So mark is from the future and knew about the volcano
i should have watched more markiplier when i was going through my 1st breakup, he somehow cures so much of my depression and gives me a reason to laugh 😂 Thank you Mark, much love my man!
This could be the best horror game music in a hot minute.
ooooooh how ive misse these videos!! BTW, hows Mr Patch? still close? haha
He still have the mark on his nose.
I had somthing like the opal candy quite a bit when I was a kid. It was Italian candy. I completely forgot about it till just now
Wait.... What's Spencer doing at ya'lls house? :O
I like the red vine licorice but I hate black licorice. So I wouldn't have liked most of that candy lol
A pyroclastic flow is one of the most terrifying things that can happen to you on this planet... for about 2 seconds and then you've instantly been both incinerated and ground into dust at the same time. Reinforced concrete turns into a plate of burnt spaghetti when it gets hit by a pyroclastic flow.  And yet people live near volcanoes. MANY people.
There are cats running around everywhere in Iceland
Try New Zealand candy next!!!!!!!!!!!
Can I just say. I know he’s reviewing candy but man I can’t get past the video quality on this. It’s so crisp and the warm lighting makes it very pretty
37:05  licorice
I learned today that Iceland likes licorice
Pls come to Brazil and taste brazilian candy
Wow I am so used to matpat making videos about markiplier, I did not expect Mark to mention matpat
10:40
20:27 mark not knowing what to do with the nipple
Your melody candy is apparently a call to cats as mine went on point.
that pipe sound got m e so hard please Markiplier use that sound more the flute sound it funny
Can someone please get mark some tweezers for his insanely long black nosehairs. My dude I can tell you its not that painful....or at least get landscaped to sponsor your vids and do a nose hair videos
Please reuse the whistle in other videos it was so pleasing
Hahaha Mark you never fail to make my day....er night in my case
Mark is complacent. I feel his YouTube channel is stagnant, and all his friends have excelled and keep growing. I just pray he wakes up and starts climbing the subscriber polls again you got this mark.
Does anyone else think Mark looks like a pirate?
Lixian's sounds effects and timing when a piece falls off the table! 😂😂😂 I'm a cackling mess!
you should try Indian Snacks. Gulab Jamun, Jelebi, most Haldiram's products, etc would be really fun to watch you review and rate.
Someone make a beat out of that whistle playing, I want to hear a really cool song out of it!
is going to Iceland a business expense now LOL
Hearing Mark admit to licking salt off his hand was very relatable. Personally I like to take a piece of ungrounded salt and just suck on it like candy.
can someone please tell the guy to eat the candy already , hahaha
It's when food passed the american food standard you should be worried. Not European ^^
A food theory❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉
Is it just impossible for Mark to eat with less decibels jfc
i love your reviews
HELP I ESCAPED HIS MIND HE'S COMING BACK!!!!!
Mark with a smile"I have good news, its not blue liquorice!"  Not even 2 seconds later crying. "I hace bad news.. I still dont know what that is!!"
I didn't know Iceland had cocoa trees!
“Is that the Swedish flaaaaaaag”
the *Amy happy noises* made me happy😭❤️
Mark is doing some crunch ASMR lol Just saying
Captain Mark Sparrow minus the alcohol 😅
"all we have is a light beer"   is Mark Tryin to UNalive himself?
licorice
Markiplier you are older than I am and you are telling me you never had Bubbledust brooo.
Mark: no cats in Iceland Meanwhile there is a brand called cats of Reykjavik {Icelands capital}
is it me or when Mark read the text on the thrid candy.. you got the feeling he was reading the Necronomicon and the army of darkness was going to show up?
Fun fact: The name of the jerrycan refers to its German origins, Jerry being slang for Germans
thats basically mark eating licorice for 50 min
I’m too high for this shit
I could eat tonnes of Þristur.
opal=lemon and pickled rice
Did anyone else think the candy whistle tune sounded familiar? Like from some pop song that exists somewhere in the world?
I can't get over how Mark just casually talks to Lixian like some imaginary friend in his videos trusting that Lixian edits himself in in post.
socker=sugar    also swedish
The amount of nose hairs hes got poking out is astonishing
the fact that Markiplier made that reference right as MatPat is about to retire just makes it that much more bitter-sweet
Anyone else recognize that Bubble Jug?! That powdery bubble gum in that same container was part of my childhood here in the US, too!
Soo, i would say every other candy is icelandic
No one gonna comment how Mark  without a time to process gave that gummy chocolate to amy as she likes those, that's a relationship that lasts long right there
Gotta love that matpat reference
I literally started to wear headbands like this a few months ago and now I see him wearing it it's great
the liquorice roll says steering wheel on the front
idk why but everything being licorice just made me think of cloudy with a chance of meatballs & how everything had sardines involved bc that’s all they had around
Dude can literally just eat candy and make it funny...
Lixian:best EDITOR markiplier:background sound effects😂❤
I love that whistle jingle, I hope he keeps using it in other videos
Diggin the hair duder. Hope you guys are well. Very interesting you didn't like the chewy salt one at 33:00 minutes. You know what it reminds me of? beef bouillon in gummy form. But for some reason I love it.
The first one is literally just a 100 gram bar 😂
Candy 2 is from sweden
1:43 AAAH
Listen to distractibale
The candy whistle sounded like you were playing the distant mountain winds at first XD
Watching Mark open any form of package stresses me the heck out. He's so destructive!
18:25 - Mark attempts to play the intro to "My Heart will go on" by Celine Dion
i want that little slide whistle jingle to be in so many more markiplier videos
Here before this blows the f up.
As a Icelander I have never used Lakkrís Rös as a straw. 42:14
mark is at peak himbo energy in this
What's a volcano?       Re-watch the beginning if you don't get it
i love markiplier videos
Mark trying to read the out the name of the candy’s is like trying to understand simlish
What? You don’t like the Swedish candy with the Swedish flag on it? lol! Mycket bra!!
This is outstanding
11:02 “Punch me in the ‘FAUSH’!” My new favorite Markiplier quote! LMFAO
Lixian is so precious
31:43 best part🤣🤣🤣🤣 i love those
i watched an almost 1 hour long video of a grown man trying some candy. cool
"Captain Mark Sparrow can't hurt you. He's not real." "I'm not worried about him hurting me. I'm wanting to commandeer a vessel with him and go on a candy tour of the world!"
why are all their sweets liquorice 😭 that's maddening
There are melody pops in Australia too, this is the only thing I've recognised so far
THE WHISTLE LOLLY HAD HAD A SLIDE?! THIS IS HOW I FIND OUT!?! I used to have those all the time when I was wee, they were strawberry flavour. Had no idea there was a slide 😂
Guys theres no such thing as volcanos guys
We get those melody pops in Australia too, I feel like that’s the most functional one I’ve ever heard lol. I remember they used to also get full of spit
The half p/b looking thing is called a Thorn, if you ever see it, it’s actually pronounced as “th”! :]
i want more Amy Mark content <3
Those were mushrooms, not nipples 😂
30:21 MARK CUT YOUR FINGERNAILS!
oooh sorry mark but the close up crunching noises remind me of my jaw popping and hurting and also teeth just dissolving sorry dont like that type of asmr
One day, mark would become a Eldrich Creature of candy
21:53 15:03
Ugh, watching Americans eat Scandinavian Candy is the worst...
I wonder how Lixian is doing. Hope his baby is growing happy and healthy
i mean the "little" people candy reminds me why i don't eat jelly babies. they look too creepy for me...sorry but just my opinion.
missed these kind of videos Mark and Lixian and lady behind the camera helping and chica too in the corner; it also be cool if you did like Lixian's send some candy where he's from and you send him some Korean candy and you guys both are next to each other trying to guess what it is without saying a word; i'd watch that 😂❤😊
We need a face cam style Chica cam  in these videos
The bubble gum is supposed to have a little metal coloured tab to keep it sealed. I think Mark grabbed one that someone had opened and took some due to how slimey it was too 😂
The whistle killed me every time
I love when Amy's included in the videos. ^_^ Watching/listening to your interactions is cute.
37:02 mint covered liqorice, also finnish
I believe Lixian should make Late Night Mop 2.
FUCKIN HELL MELODY POPS!!! They were the best sweet as a kid
Fall screams are the best timed edits YouTube sees
Mark doesn't clean his nails?
all us nords giggeling uncontrolably as he hates on our lakris and salmiak XDD
25:42 norwegian
Still wondering where he was going with that whole volcano thing...
21:58 how is there more swedish candy than icelandic 😭
21:10 swedish again
You should review Brazilian candy next!
Mark: *Immediately cringes from hockey puck candy* Also Mark to Amy: You should try this
Professional YouTuber, this guy.
Blaze the Movie Fan: “Markipiler what the He🏒🏒are you doing in my car.”
Legend says hes still deciding which category to put the licorice roll candy in
16:25 the center is filled with a very specific ingredient enjoyed in scandinavia, namely….ammonium chloride…I know it sounds bad but it’s very good and sort of like an acquired taste. Like literally you kinda grow up with it and get used to it.
2 minutes in this was the most startling video whilst high
15:12 finnish candy 💀
4:36 swedish flag and text 💀
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, I LIVE IN ICELAND AND I MISSED AN OPPORTOUNITY TO SEE MY FAV YOUTUBER.
Mark; Eating an Icelandic candy bar; "Please be a wafer" - Sir, you do realize you are eating stuff from Iceland right? The land that ludicrously loves its licorice.
Ja mark det var den svenska flaggan snälla testa svenskt godis om du någonsin gör en till video när du testar godis
Mark plead with he instrument candy can you do the lethal company rocket song
In South Africa we call the first candy a Lunch Bar
You are chalk….mark…what the hell…..
Cats are in Iceland. they are very popular and important over there. However, I believe Italy holds the crown for how important they hold cats. Cats are like royalty in Italy, you can face a serious penalty, even prison, for hurting or injuring a cat in Italy
"my grandma does not have this candy cause shes... Korean"
"Hjärtligt gott från Gränna" is from the swedish town "Gränna". Unfortunately not authentic Icelandic candy.
Mark: "It's not that sweet."  I'm from europe. I ordered american candy once. it was INCREDIBLY sugary. I heard that americans who live abroad for a while and then return only then notice just how sweet everything is over there.  There's actually a lot of sugar in those gummies, but as Mark said: Over there it's basically jellyfied sugar.
"That's the saltiest thing I've ever tasted! And I once tasted a heaping bowl of salt!"
I'm so happy this video was almost an hour long
Came to see Icelandic candy, stayed for the Mark asmr.
Skole kridt Scandinavian not from iceland
I'm glad that as a dutchy, I finally belong to the north
please if you're going to Ireland let us know D:
Wonder how long mark actually played with the whistle lollipop??? 🤷🏼‍♀️😂
Hearing markiplier read say swedish stuff is brilliant xD
13:55 It looks like there's a tiny ball of steel in there or something!
I got curious about cats on Iceland and googled it. The result: "Reykjavik, the town of cats" 😅
Markiplier saying he didn't see a single cat in Iceland makes me wonder if he actually went.
Licorice and milk tastes really good together. You should try it
I think Lixian is probably one of my favorite editors
damn when your mint candies fell of the packet and you lifted your hands, my m&ms bag fell too XD
Y'all dont have Maoam in MURICA??
The gum tube is shit anyway. Gum but very sticky and very bland. I imagine that's what glue tastes like.
Ammonium chloride?! That stuff is used for batteries, and you ate it?!?
The last one made me a proud Dane.
Salmiak is the best shit ever
Sorry Mark, watched as much as I could but I'm one of those people that can't hear other people chew😭 Hope you enjoyed it! I made it half way
Lixian's editing skill is amazing. The subtle screams when Mark drops anything made my whole day
Special shout outs to Lyxian for more great editing (the screams of the candy jumping off the table) and Amy's meticulous passing the candies across the table. She should work at a bar sliding drinks!
19:06 Chica coming in like " what the heck is this candy dog whistle??" makes this bit even better!
Djöflar is my all time favorite candy! I eat the whole bag in less than hour ☠️
When did Jack Sparrow start hosting videos? Today we're going to review Icelandic candy's.... Savvy?
Putting tyrkisk peber in your mouth and just biting it, barbarian! XD You are supposed to savor those, so the filling inside mixes with your spit. I think the reason you like bülow stuff is because they use real liquorice which is soft and kind of sweet, where a lot of Nordic liquorice candy is salt or ammonia liquorice which is salty or has a harsher taste to it like piratos XD
I really like Marks coat! I kinda want one 😂
The second one has the swedish flag as you guessed, gränna is well known for their candy "canes"
The gas station by my house when I was a kid sold melody pops, I haven't seen those in forever
Did I see Spencer?
as somone that grew up in a northern country. and hate likorice. trying new candy was like nqvigating a mine field
As an American I can confirm that Mark ate candy!
Am I the only one who thought the jingle sounded like a Vocoloid song?
18:00 this is classic lolipop in Czech, everyone loves it
The Risa þristor is pronounced Tristor, the þ is a hard th that's pronounced similarly to T
Him saying Dutch instead of Danish 🥺
America doesnt have maoam? Im surprised, its all over the place in england
I really wanted to see the haunted mask
Me seeing the Swedish flag at once 🫣🙃
I love the candy whistle jingle 🥹🥹
Ah yes, Skule Krid. I was an American child trying these with my Dutch grandfather many years ago, I never thought I would see them again :'). I would danm near go into convulsions everytime I had one, but they were his absolute favorite, so I would eat them with him until my central nervous system began attacking itself.
mark probably looks like a schitzo in real life when he's "talking" to lixian
33:13 Amy coughing like a cat is priceless
chica coming to listen after Mark blasted the melody was so fun
The tune sounded like he was trying to make it sound like THE WHISTLE
Right not having normal American food safety standards is not good honesty. Calories/knowing what toxic stuff or what they put in it is important lol Its not bad to not know but its safety. Also to much shuger and salt is bad for you
No bull, but im almost 100% sure a volcano did erupt in Indonesia recently.....trying to tell us something here, Mark?
2:55 so close!!! ❤
The fact that half the candy was from Sweden 🇸🇪 😂
it was a really fun intro
That slide candy jingle actually slaps
Anyone from Iceland. Do you have cats?
Sorry Mark, but that was indeed the Swedish flag on the first candy's packaging
🎉
The candy you called a handful of salt is right up my alley of candy 👌
I don't know why but i love the way Mark sais the word candy😂
"There's no such thing as volcanos"
Mark: "Please be a wafer cripsy"  It's gonna be one gummy worm in chocolate coating
5:54 yes, yes Mark, that is the Swedish flag. and according to google maps, Gränna is a place in sweden famous for it's large variety of candy 👍👍
I just realised that Mark has grey hairs...
all those screams that was lixian for sure
As a Icelandic person seeing Mark eating the things I have been eating for most of my life is so strange but most of them aren’t Icelandic candy. You had roughly 7 to 8 technically Icelandic. The first one is from Iceland and the name says ChristmasCat where in Iceland long time ago we believe that the parents of the 13 Santa’s we have in our country owned a cat that was big and scary and if young kids wouldn’t get new clothes for Christmas he would come and get them and eat them for dinner.  Also the Opal box is one of the oldest candy Icelanders still makes, it was founded in 1945 and old people really love it.  But the worst one you had is Icelandic and really no one knows why it’s still in shops where the name of it is the Devil but we are quite wired in Iceland around our candy and just but “lakkrís” in everything
Mark, I have 4 technical nipples, theres these two dots with tiny little almost microscopic nipples under my normal ones right above my ab muscles, apparently theres a few stars with it too like Harry Styles, pretty crazy, but thank you for telling me im special.
Having been to Gränna and also passing through it during basically my whole childhood I can only laugh. At least he realised that the flag /could/ be Swedens, which is already better than most Americans I’ve seen online.  Also, just wanna point out that the candy at 36:30 is meant to look like the chalk for a chalkboard. And THANK YOU for pointing out that the UFO’s taste like styrofoam, I’ve never understood how anyone could possibly like them.  (Also, a tip: if the O has dots, bet on Sweden or Finland. If it’s a line through it or letters are together as one, Denmark or Norway. If it has both? Probably Iceland.)
Yay I'm loved by Mark!❤
this is an emotional masterpiece. I love seeing him become increasingly wary through the video because of the candy betrayal
Waiing for fellow Finns in the comments…
the second candly looks like razzles
the showing of Chica made my week.
@43:29  the...but hey's ... LMAO
Good to know that Icelandic candy is basically different forms of licorice and/or salt. Very interesting concept and made for a hilarious video
Tyrkisk peber is from Denmark, just saying :D
I feel like Mark is entertaining his jack sparrow era
Swedish hard candy lol
How did i not hear that mark came to my country
i've been waiting for this video to drop since that distractible episode😵‍💫
SHOW MORE OF DOG
ah!! Turkish Peber~ Turkinpippurit!!  Torille!!
Why do they have licorice in everything
Alternate title: Mark discovers salmiac
Norwegian candy next? <3
I think I have eaten most if not all of this candy before. And I'm Norwegian. Though us Nordics share a lot of our candy between each other, and Iceland did kinda originate from Norway. (Iceland is really similar to how Norway was back in the viking ages. The difference is that we were affected a lot by our neighboring countries and changed a lot since then, while Iceland was kinda isolated, so it has evolved and changed, but it's still close to it's roots.)
The pain when you put authentic icelandic candy in "fake" and swedish and other in authentic haha
How do you make me feel bad for you.... While you sit and eat candy?
puppy cam onto the left top corner
MARK! Icelandic is the language that has these in it's alphabet: Ðð Éé Íí Óó Úú Ýý Þþ Ææ Öö  Fun fact, the name for "Þ" is "þorn" ... the "Þ" is pronounced as "th" and not "p"
In Denmark we have warnings on licorice w/ ammonium chloride (salmiak), that you shouldn't eat it all in one sitting, because it could give you health complications haha.
7:28 the grab from the pants of the fallen candy though 11:01 punch you in the what? 19:55 cute 20:18 nipples 25:29 happy Amy noises !! 28:33 Mark begs for mint and explodes 32:50 Amy impression 38:27 good news bad news 39:51 Chica still has no legs 41:11, 47:54, 49:18 Chica and Henry play (and Spencer) 41:24 whatever he says *shows tongue* 43:30 but hey yolo?/peepee poopoo/ITS JUST A THEORY A FOOOD THEORY 45:43 big dick money bags
Fun fact, you can pretty much always tell if a chocolate-covered candy is from Iceland, because it has a very specific taste that I haven't found anywhere else. I have a suspicion that there's one big chocolate factory in Iceland where all the candy companies get their chocolate from.
4:50 "this is probably authentic" ... It has a Swedish flag on the bag. and the text on it is in Swedish.
You should have asked Ólafur Waage about what candy to try.
is mark ever gonna play Sons Of The Forest again?? 😭😭😭😭
Review Nowegian candy next.  There is a lot of good candy here. Also, don't you dare call Kvikklunsj a copy of KitKat.
As much as I don’t want to squash your hopes of the last one (Lakrids by Bülow) being Icelandic, it’s actually Danish, we have a whole bunch of flavours, ranging from raspberry, to several holiday inspired ones with cinnamon and other Christmassy spices, they’re seriously good, as someone who doesn’t love liquorish, I can eat these and enjoy them just as much as my favourite candies
hi mark love the vid but can u do one for south africa
19:00 my dogs lost their shit hearing this lol
Markiplier does unintentional ASMR lol
Why is no one talking about how successful that candy whistle is??? And how good the little candy jingle Mark made is?? I'm shipping two thousand whistles to my house immediately.
I have never seen that Jerry can candy in the UK, I honestly thought it was popping candy
I imagine they are slightly less awesome in taste... but better texture. hmmm
everything is like liquorice colour and pink
When is the mexican candy review
I would love to see your reaction to South Africa's candy. Please also try biltong!!
I'm curious: what was he doing in Iceland? Was it just vacation, work, or a mission to get a bunch of licorice?
mark looks like he just got finished filming an episode of survivor
18:51 triggers the dog, so the dog comes and it's like "what are you doing."
as an icelandic i am dissapointed in how few of the candy is actually icelandic but still a great video
*Chupa Chups appears* Me: *gasps in spanish*
The one he hated so much because of the saltier than salt flavour, was actually one of my favourites as a kid. We call them Heksendrop (Witch-licorice) in the Netherlands, and I should really go buy some again, I forgot about them for a sec
Maoam pinballs are my favourite sweet :)
Tyrkisk peber is the best (we have it in denmark but i dont know if it is danish or what?
this video is just mark slowly losing his mind over lickerish...    i love it!!
Mark is slowly turning into Jack Sparrow, and I have to say… it fits!
18:02 hey!!!!! i from the uk and that whistle gave me a LOT of nostalgia
I wonder if beautiful eyes Markimoo will ever do a lens review video. Lol  <3
Mark should be in the next pirates of the caribbean
Do the Indian ones....NOW
Hjärtligt god jul från gränna is indeed from Sweden, It translates to Merry christmas from Gränna which is a city here in Sweden
I think you just ate a bunch of cough medicine bud. Ammonium chloride and liquorice are used in cough drops.
that was swedish candy!  Gränna! xD its a place in sweden! AHAHAHA xD
I was watching this in front of the  fam, and the little screams got me sad bad, I'm dying 27:27
Why are all Icelandic candies are made of liqourice at this point
Safety seals are common in America bc of the Tylenol murders... Iceland didn't have that lol
Ammonium chloride is used in pickling... and fertilizer.  Also Tyrkisk Pebers are filled with it, so that was the "unidentifiable" flavor.
i know exactly what the chalk looking thing is. Its a small crunchy coating, with licourice in it. Sometimes with a little mint inside it.
As a northern european its funny to see Mark hate the same candies as i do and like some of the same ones too! My dad loves the «tyrkisk peber» and the hockey powder stuff and i HATE IT and im glad Mark does too XD
Skolkritor ❤
that damn slide whistle  i loved those as a kid.
The camera quality tho
ICELANDER REACTS to bets  Jólaköttur ICELANDIC - But definitely inspired by American sweets Hjarteligt NOT FROM ICELAND -  Swedish, enjoyed by Icelanders Trítlar ICELANDIC - A classic in many flavours, originally chocolate coated sweet liqurice Gum Jerry Can NOT FROM ICELAND obvi Star Roll Apollo ICELANDIC but scandi inspired - You could unroll it.. Nice cinema snack Peppermint NOT FROM ICELAND - Never heard of it lol Tyrkish Peber NOT FROM ICELAND - Scandinavian, but FREQUENTLY eaten here Whistle pop Chupa Chups NOT FROM ICELAND - Nostalgia hit me hard on this one Mushrooms NOT FROM ICELAND Hockey Pulve NOT FROM ICELAND - Enjoyed on popcorn and ice cream MAOAM Balls NOT FROM ICELAND Super Sett ICELANDIC  Opal ICELANDIC - Classic pastille breath freshener in many flavours "Bismark" Mint candies NOT FROM ICELAND Djöflar Demons ICELANDIC Liquid Gum NOT FROM ICELAND (Someone probably had a lil snack at the shop ew) Risa Þristur (Huge Three) ICELANDIC Skolekridt NOT FROM ICELAND - Translated to school chalk Tyrkish Peber Sour Fruits NOT FROM ICELAND Sour UFOs NOT FROM ICELAND Lakkrisrör ICELANDIC  Lakrids Balls NOT FROM ICELAND  8/22 from Iceland, misleading title.. but fun video! Loads of cats here by the way, surprised you didn't see any
Brooo!!! I’m from FL and I used to get those melody pops all the time growing up!!!!!!!
Candy lands are Switzerland latvija lithuania Kolumbija and more
We used to have bubbledust in the US when I was a kid I think
21:57 HOCKEY PULVER LETS GOOOOO
Also I am south European so I hate licorice with a passion (as almost every logic human being)
and btw, maoam is GERMAN, i know that, because i live in germany
and the so called nipple is a mushroom, its a marshmellow
So i guess US doesn't have that dusty concoction  that pops in your tongue? I am asking because Mark haven't see something similar judging from his reaction from the jerry can thingie
South african candy next pls and do more re games !!!
Omg I forgot about Melody Pops! I use to love these as a child! They're everywhere in UK I think so maybe originally from UK.  Also want to add that alot of these are in the UK. Pinbals are one of my favourites!
im finnish and this kinda triggers me, because he knows anbsolutly nothing about scandinavian things
mark spealing in a Nordic accent is funny as hell
iceland aint the only place with sheep head
They don't have maoam in america???
28:49 hahahahahaha
the second candy thing literly has a swedish flag on it.
Newest gorden Ramsey
As a danish person its funny seeing Mark eating some of the candy that I for once know some of
Pretty sure ammonium chloride is not safe to ingest
I want to know about the volcano
Mark, the whistle candy should have notes you can play on the wrapper

I love the whistle tune to introduce the new candy! And I love Amy’s commentary! We need more Amy appearances and commentary (if she’s comfortable with it) 💙
Yeah ammonium chloride is what makes salmiakki / salt liquorice taste salty and chemically! It's an acquired taste for sure  I'm going to Iceland later this spring and it's fun to see what there is to look forward to! Turkisk Peber is made here in Finland though, and I'm pretty sure Hockey Pulver is Swedish

hope you liked our candy.
I was born in Iceland but left the country like 20 years ago, and i dont recognise most of these sweets funnily enough which is a shame, but feel seen :D
Wait so do we not find out the actual answers? Do we have to Google to find what he got right?
I kinda see mark trying British sweets because I wanna see his reaction to my country’s sweets
If it isn’t already, that whistle jingle needs to be a text tone! I’d buy a download of that!😜
why does mark’s house look so good 😩
The powdered gum in a gas can I remember eating as a kid back in the late 90s here in the states. Who knows where that mess comes from.

4:36 hjärtligt gott från Gränna, with a Swedish flag looks very Icelandic.  15:05 think trykisk peber is danish but fazer is finish, think it used to be available with a swedish name. i guess it could be icelandic though. it's a bit spicy instead of salty 18:02 think those where available when i was younger, i think the brand is not nordic/scandinavian but don't know. 20:24 another swedish flag, similar ones are easily available in sweden, don't know what brand though. i guess "svampar" is kind of like nipples. those nipples are darker though. 21:56 hokey pulver sounds swedish but looks different from ones i see. feel like it's related to snus/tobacco and hokey players, kind of like chocolate cigarettes. 24:40 super sett lakris bitar, sounds pretty swedish but "sett" is not swedish, might mean sött/sweet 30:21 is it like old swedish tetra pack 31:29 i guess djöflar could mean devils or djävlar/jävlar in swedish. probably salty.  34:32 yeah, who knows how long it could have been unsealed   36:40 think it's danish, usually sold in white packages in my place. i think it's pretty good. 37:53 the other one is better, there are soft variants of the original ones as well. or strong liquor licorice. 40:53 those are nice when you had some salty or sour licorice but you need something that isn't licorice so you go for sour or salty paper. 42:55 brother gave me some beer during christmas, wasn't expecting 10%+ beer, it was pretty tasty though. 44:29 as long as it last well though. oh looks like it might 46:04 oh, it took me a while to realize what he thought was wrong with the licorice. there are some soft licorice with condensed milk and/or milk powder and i think possibly licorice powder on the outside, maybe a bit fudge like
31:28 the second he read "salmiakk" I was like OH NOOO 🤣🤣
6:47 / 6:50 The Trítlar Candy 🍬 by NÓA is actually original from Iceland 🇮🇸🐏🌋🧊🏝️ 😊😊😊🎉🎉😎😎😊😃😃😄🤜🏻🤛🏻👍🏻🤘🏻🍺🍺🍺🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻
we have melody pops in australia!
Melody pops are available here on Australia I’m only up to the part where you opened it but it’s not from Iceland if it’s available in Australia
Tyrkisk peber is such a classic finnish candy and it's superior. Bad taste
Where that plain goin 💀
i SWEAR i know that whistle from SOMETHING  pls helppp
I love the whistle transition and hope to hear it again; it reminds me of a happy pirate.

Hello Mark! We sold you some of the candy when you came to our store! Hope you had a nice stay in Iceland!  Also, as an Icelandic person, I can confirm which candies are Icelandic:  Candy 1: Icelandic. Cats do in fact live in Iceland. I own 2 of them. The reason you did not see any is because the temperatures during winter are too extreme for cats to be wandering outside for long periods of time. Candy 2: Not Icelandic (its Swedish, but a lot of Icelanders love that particular candy!). Candy 3: Icelandic. Candy 4: Not Icelandic (I have never seen bubble dust in my entire life, most likely from the UK like you said). Candy 5: Icelandic. Candy 6: Probably not Icelandic. From the way you pronounced the name, it's probably Danish.  Candy 7: Not Icelandic (It's Finnish. We Icelanders really like it though, so it can be considered an Icelandic favorite!). Candy 8: Not Icelandic. Chupa Chups is a Spanish brand. Candy 9: Not Icelandic. (It's Swedish.) Candy 10: Not Icelandic. (It's Norwegian. I personally love it though!). Candy 11: Not Icelandic. Maoam is a German brand. Candy 12: Icelandic. Candy 13: Icelandic. Candy 14: Unsure, Can't read the package. Mints aren't exactly traditional in Iceland, but they could have been made here! My bet is that it was made in Denmark. Candy 15: Icelandic. Again, we have plenty of cats in Iceland. The candy type itself isn't native to Iceland, but that particular brand is Icelandic and so it was manufactured here! Candy 16: Not Icelandic. French brand of candy. Candy 17: Icelandic. This one's a classic. Candy 18: Not Icelandic. That one is from Denmark originally, but the brand you got is Finnish. Candy 19: Not Icelandic. Finnish brand. Candy 20: Not Icelandic. I have no idea where that's from. Candy 21: Icelandic. It's recommended to drink cola through it! candy 22: Not Icelandic. Danish brand. We do have Icelandic versions of that candy though, so I'd give you half a point for that one.  Note: the reason why so much candy is "salty" is because of the ammonium chloride in it, also known as salmiak. That, as well as licorice, is popular in all Nordic countries!  Thanks for visiting our little island!
That much salt? Cute, try vegemite.
Foam mushroom sweets used to be my favourite sweets out of pick n mix and Mark calling them nipples just sent me
I have eaten a Finnish Salmiak and I can definitely say that it is the worst thing I have ever eaten on this planet
15:04 / 15:05 / 15:13 / 17:35 / 17:58 / 17:59 The Tyrkisk Peber Hard Candy 🍬 is actually not from Iceland 🇮🇸🐏🌋🧊🏝️ at all and not from Finland 🇫🇮🦌🧊 either at all, but The Tyrkisk Peber Hard Candy 🍬 is actually original from Salling, Jutland, Denmark 🇩🇰🦢👑 since 1977 😊😊😊😊🎉🎉😊😊😊😃😃😁😄😄😎😎🤜🏻🤛🏻👍🏻🤘🏻🍬🍬🍬🇩🇰🇩🇰🇩🇰🦢👑🍺🍺🍺🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻
hey mark, the candies at 5 min is from sweden, in a town called Gränna.
Salmiakki mainittu! Torille!
Kind of wish you would have looked up to see how many you got right and how wrong you were on a lot of them.
I love these videos, but he opens things like a maniac. I just want to know how he stores them after violating their poor packaging.
FINALLY AN IRL VID
A classic thing to make with the tyrkisk peber is to crush them up pour into a flask and fill up with vodka to make it into a shot.
Are we getting captain pirate markiplier?
19:05 Chica in the background coming to check out the noise lmao
I love the swapping between different cameras. I think this is hilarious considering how much of a bit it is on distractible for him to talk about lenses😂
Maaaaarrrrk why did you steal Spencerrrrr???????
This reminds me of the Sour Patch series lmao
As a Scandinavian, I love almost everything here.. I'm pretty sure you put a lot of things that was Icelandic in the not Icelandic pile 😆 those salt pipes that you didn't like is one of my favorite candy's 🤣🙈 and I can eat a whole.bag of em in one sitting a Saturday night! 🤣 you should try Svenskjävlar, claimed to be worlds saltiest licorice. I'm Norwegian though and, so my taste-pallet loves everything licorice. 😁 love theese videos Mark. I had a laugh! Been an while since I've seen one of theese
I will start by saying I haven't finished the video while making this comment lol. But the "Jerry Can" or gas can I remember getting and seeing in stores when I was a kid in the US.
i mentally exploded when i saw he made another one of these reviews
Love Mark
That licorice straw was a paid actor
I do love me some licorice every now and again. Thanks for doing a review of Icelandic candies! Definitely on one of my travel/ tasting destination goals. Just thought I'd say, although not incredibly common, eating licorice everyday or in large quantities esp. potent black licorice can be tasty but fatal, as a condition known as pseudohyperaldosteronism. Snack responsibly all XD
You look like a pirate and I'm loving it
i like that thing on his forehead, he looks sexy 7u7r
As a swedish person I'm glad to see some candy from my country ;D
Also why doesn’t mark use google translate or something
How many did he get right?
Man he looks so cool.
I love darkiplier
Jólaköttur: yo la kuh tur the second one is swedish it has the flag on it i don t know how to pronounce it trítlar: tree tl ar (roll the "R") Sneaky bubbledust: English stjörnurúlla: st yu err nuh roo l AHH (dont scream it) Chocolate peppermints: english Tyrkisk pepper is from Tyrkland don't remember the name in english Melody pops: english the 9th one is swedish and i dont know how to pronounce it i think the tenth one is dutch and i dont know how to pronounce it  Súpersett Lakkrís bitar: super set  La  greece bit ar (i know very different) Opal: opal (grandmas eat this a lot) its just mint... its mintur in icelandic but no one cares Djöflar: D yuh blarh (the H is silent) Tubble gum: its english Risa þristur: Riss ahh thr ih stur Its the same as Tyrkisk pepper! Its The Same As Tyrkisk Pepper!! Frisia: is not icelandic, i don't know where its from Lakkrís rör: La  greece R uh r Slow crafted: English  a lot of candy is named in english cause of tourism, almost everyone owns a cat your lying to yourself mark, And yes this did take me an hour
The gas cans of bubble dust are not unfamiliar to me here in the US, but ours are not Sneaky
Not related but Markiplier is like the content creator version of John Wick. I think not only in appearance but also just Mark himself, excluding his appearance.
The camera is so crisp
You should make a video about Slovak sweets @Markiplier 🍥😺
I'm getting some captain Jack sparrow vibes from how mark is dressed
i love that jingle 😂😂
Tyrkisk peber is a Finnish thing. Personally, I love it.
How Amy isn't laughing so much i dont know lol
I have to say, goddamn. I love that candy whistle jingle. 37:42
I do love all types of content he makes but these are definitely my comfort videos 😂❤
Iceland. The place licorice goes to die.
One thing the Jólaköttur is a Big part of christmas  in iceland, its a giant cat that would eat kids the only way to not get eaten was to get new clothes for christmas.
“Not my grandma. My grandma is Korean.” 😂
Mark: I bet I’m not supposed to bite it, but I do not have the mental fortitude or the discipline to be able to hold back from that  Also Mark: **eats takis by sucking the dust off and then spitting them out**
As an Icelandic person im surprised that he found the gum powder ive gotten it once from an asian supermarket in Álfheimar, also the 3 candy bar is the best icelandic candy and no one can change my mind.
With that bandana and hair, Mark's starting to look like young Jack Sparrow.😂
Huh, Maoam is actually German. Didn't know that. He was right on that.
18:49 why is this soo entertaining 🤣
TURKISH PEBER! FAMOUS FINNISH CANDY! FINLAND MENTIONED! TO THE MARKETPLACE!
Still waiting on that review on palworld bucko
MARK!! IM STILL STUCK IN YOUR HEAD!!! I DONT KNOW WHERE THE EXIT IS!!…WHY DOES IT LOOK LIKE THE MAP OF LETAL COMPANY?!
do Portuguese candy youre so Portuguese
OMG it’s my first time seeing chica I always had this image that chica was a Pomerania or a small dog that had a goofy 🤪 little face but I was wrong
I used to get Melody Pops as a kid in the 80s/early 90s in the US. I don't think they are Icelandic? Also, TubbleGum was my favorite back in the 90s. I used to buy it at Toys R Us. Apparently it's not anywhere as good as it used to be.
“it’s just a theory A FOOD THEORY” was so random i love it ‼️
The one that's white looks like the Peppermint Candy Coated licorice
We have the jerry cans here in Canada. 🤣
Yeah, Tyrkish Peber isn't Icelandic, lol... Fazer is a Finnish company. Some of the best Fazer candies are Vihreät kuulat (since 1929), Pihlaja (since 1895), Julia (since 1955) and Fazerin sininen (since 1922). There's also a Finnish candy called Tervaleijona that's been flavored with wood tar; I think we're actually the only country that uses it to flavor things, lol.  Salmiak salt is a terrible flavor, even I hate it despite being Finnish. 💀 Oh yeah, the powder inside the Tyrkisk Peber is literally just salmiak salt (i.e. ammonium chloride).
Lixian, the little candy screams made me unable to breathe because I was laughing so hard. Thank you.
No cats in Iceland HA! There is ONE HUGE CAT. This thing be 10ft tall and eats people that do not get clothing for yule. Only way to prevent devourment is to give bowl of milk.
I enjoyed this video so much
Wait we never know which one is Iceland
Man, I love Lixian's editing. lmao
This was by far one of the funniest videos I've seen from Mark. I was laughing so much!
I love that tune 🎶
Better title. Mark gets emotionally broken by licorice
Need more whistle
Tyrkisk Peber are the best. It's the one hard candies that I have now and again. Also saltlakrits makes up a lot of scandinavian candy flavours. With amonium chloride is used instead of sodium chloride.
spencer? what is such a lovely boy doing here? anyway, love lil jingle, that candy whistle is the best thing i ever tried as a kid and i only got it once cause my parents kind of hated it lol
0:28 thanks! Life saving tip! I’ll go swimming in a big pool of orange pool surrounded by rocks :)
I need that whistle as a ring tone XD
Mark you be looking like a scrumptious Jack Sparrow in this video <3
Salt licorice is an acquired taste for sure.
truly the intro
i thought it was gonna be an Epstein joke
I love the rogue candy screams, so random but so funny.
This was pleasantly fun. Thanks mark!
Mark! Starring in… Captain Sparrow in Iceland!
we need more chica cam's!!🥰 LOVE the content mark as always !!👌
As of the middle of watching this video, I am positive I have discovered a new sound for notifications on my phone
I was just watching you eat licorice and by the end I said to my self “I will never eat licorice again!”
I, personally, would not have a problem if a little "Puppy Playtime" PIP appeared in the corner of a video every once in a while.😝
Honestly....this is Mark's descent into Jack Sparrowhood.
You reminded me that one of my favorite treats as a kid was this dill pickle flavored salt. I think it was for beer, but I just ate it straight. I added it to my next grocery order. 😂  I live in Texas, so I see a lot of Mexican candy around, and I'd noticed that they do salty and spicy things. It seemed weird to me because I'd always understood "candy" to mean "sweet", but now I'm thinking that's just an American thing?
It's nice to see Gummies exist up north. Powdered Gum, not something I would have thought up. Seeing as stick gum turns stiff and breaks in the face of cold... maybe a solution there.
4:00 like a 100 grand bar
Mark should try American candy
The screams when the candy falls killed me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I remember getting those whistle pops as a prize at Chuck E Cheese's when I was a kid!
22:25 is my favorite part😂 The pure unbridled disgust, and the fact that ive never heard him make that sound before
If you like the pinball things, i would recommend that you try a candy called sour cherry balls, they sound verry similar. They're tart but once the candy coating is gone the inside is a sweet gummy.
What is up with Iceland and licorice? It’s like one of the worst candies and it seems likes it’s the only candy they have.
18:57* and we don’t even have to pay to see this time 😊
And that's why Markiplier shops at Iceland.
I missed your review videos so much!!
Is that Ethan’s dog with them?
Fazer is a Finland brand my boyfriend told me he is from Finland so I don’t think anything with that brand is Icelandic originating
Why do i have an unnerving feeling of a super volcano explosion happening soon?
mark you should make a vlog channel or something
the bubble gum dust in a jug was one of my favorites as a kid, but I live in Jamaica and i haven't seen it in years idk if its that same one from Iceland
When I look into Mark's mind, i just keep seeing that "King of the squirrel's" video he did in the past lol
I like how he's using  ,  instead of  .
The raspberry/liquorice hard candies were basically called “cordially good from Gränna” and Gränna is a Swedish town famous for their hard candies, like candy canes. Raspberry/liquorice is a very popular flavour combination in Sweden.
The powdered gum is Canadian… I think mark was a lil off today..
I don’t think America has any food safety standards at this point
Guys… I think there’s something going on. It seems weird that he felt the need to say he was mark and that there was nothing going on.  Feels like maybe this isn’t Mark and there IS something going on.
This video should have been renamed I am running the icelantic licorice gauntlet of 2024
Mark's nose hairs look like little spood feets
Bulbous nodules is getting added to my vocab immediately
I enjoy the sound everytime another pack of candy slides across the table 😚
MMONIUM CHLORIDE IS USED TO MAKE DRY BATTERIEES????
Disappointing that Icelandish don't just eat chunks of ice everyday
Omg, I laughed so hard. 😂
Anybody have answers for which is which?
Instructions unclear, I am now trapped in the third degree of Mark's mind. Help.
The candy coated licorice is just like good and plenty candy in America
Hehehe, Mark said that I’m special and he loves me because I don’t have exactly two nipples (I have three. I’m a dude)
happy Amy sounds are the one of best sounds
I never thought Mark would teach me anything but I learned how much the Icelandic people love licorice and salty candy today.  Thank you Mark!
Please, do a Finland candy version for peak entertainment 😂
It's OK Mark. I like bulbous nodules too.
It’s almost like it’s asmr but markiplier is screaming in the mic
mark sparrow
I may have missed it but has the iron lung movie released yet and if not when might it be coming out?
Thanks for quoting matpat I’m going to miss him. Are you going to miss him mark?
Hockey pulver is from Sweden.
45:31  "Scooby Doo Whoopie Dooo"!!!!😂 IF YOU KNOW, YOU KNOWWWW😎
The melody pops are sold on Amazon and walmart
OMG lixian still edits for Mark!?!?!?
tl;dr the icelandic really really really like licorice
Love the classic "I'm losing my hair" Headband
I looked up each candy to see how Mark did on guessing if it was Icelandic or not.  Jolakottur - X - Icelandic, named after a cat from Icelandic folklore. Frannson's hjärtligt gott fran Gränna - X - it's a swedish candy. Tritlar - ✓-Made in Iceland.  Sweet Bandit Sneaky Bubbledust - X - it's from the UK, like it says on the jerrycan.  Sjornu Rolla - X - Icelandic. Chocolate peppermint things- he didn't show the bag up close so I couldn't look this one up. Tyrkisk Peber -✓- Originally Danish, now made in Finland. The nasty taste was ammonium chloride salts.  Chupa Chups Melody Pop -✓- Spanish. Frannson's HALLON-LAKRITSSVAMPAR - ✓- Swedish. They're supposed to be mushrooms, not nipples. Supersalt Hockey Pulver -X- Swedish Maoam Pinballs - ✓-  German Super Sett Lakkris Bitar -✓- Icelandic  Opals -✓- Icelandic, very popular there, I actually have a box in my cabinet (I personally like them).

Mark, you might not even read this but your videos make me laugh everythime i watch them, like you litteraly saved my life. love your content and humor. keep doing what you do best :D
With matpat himself leaving the theorist team, even markiplier will still put a reference of him every now and then 43:40
All I can really focus on is how much Mark looks like Orlando Bloom at the end of POTC: At Worlds End 😂
The first candy in America is called the 100 Grand bar.  The 2nd and 3rd we have candies like those but I don't recall their names.
Maoam is a german candy brand. It's essentially sub-brand of Haribo. German candy is actually fucking delicious, y'all should try some if you ever get the chance.
'not my grandma! my grandma...' 100% thought you were gonna say 'is dead' lmao like your version better
who is the new puppy?
This 🇸🇪 is indeed the Swedish flag
I was very confused about who was talking off camera that wasn’t Amy lol and then I realized that it was Amy and my ears are just not working right
More dog cam pls oh pls
mark do u fw vetements
Lovin’ the bandana look!  Get this guy on the next Pirates of the Caribbean! ❤
Putting those lenses to good use I see
Lakrids by Bülow is hands down the best licorice I've ever had. And it's from Denmark.
i like how most of the candies are just swedish can't. cus sweds know how to make candy
ingredients: soccer
This was awesome I’ve gotta see Marks reaction to Mexican/Spanish candy
Thus the best video ever made came to be
Why is Spencer at Marks?
Why did Lixian decide to blow up marks head? I don't know, but it was really funny XD 28:49
... anyone else notice that he might be picking his eyebrows? I hope the movie isn't causing him that much stress
id get sick eating all that licorice idk how people like that stuff 🤢
Tryy mexican candyyyyy
So ammonium chloride is NOT safe to ingest. They say that the ability to taste said chloride is an evolution feature to keep humans AWAY from eating it since ammonium is TOXIC. Who knew. Ingestion of dilute ammonium chloride can cause severe damage to the GI and pulmonary tracts. THE MORE YA KNOW (and yet it's used in salt licorice???)
Chica coming in with the whistle is so funny
Interesting to see 538 dislikes on this but eh whatever, people bein' people with their own opinions. loved the video :3
I just learned that the hockey pulver is salt licorice powder. I also learned that amonium chloride is uses as an expectorant and is also used in wood glue and is used to make bread just like you put sugar for active yeast you could use this type of salt as yeast nutrient
34:45 cool squish sound
I remember bubble dust! It used to be in a pink little bottle back in the 90s. 😂😂
wow great timing i was just waving the icelandic flag at my show choir competition😋
“anyone who doesn’t have two nipples” all the transmasc people without nipples: 😧 “you’re special and i love you” also all the transmascs with no nipples: 😄
This is the most over-produced and under-disciplined candy review, in the history of history, and Im here for all of it.
30:45 ptsd mark
Ammonium chloride is the worst salt to use it’s safe in very small amounts but lots can be dangerous
Aww some of those candy are similar in my home country too!
Thanks mark for another candy review video
Saltpuck haha
Mark: Thats just a theory, a FOOD theory!   *Flashback to Matpats tears.*
the literal definition of wet your whistle 😭
kinda got teary eyed when mark said matpat's line :')
this guy has been on this soul journey for the past few years and I fuggin' love it mannnn
Both Mark and Lixian's comedic timing gets me more than anything else. Cry.
I found it funny that not only was I forced to try the Swedish salmiak candies at one of my jobs (it was way too salty I thought my taste buds died), but that I also work at a theater and love snacking on popcorn with extra flavacol sprinkled on😂
37:00 I really feel like it’s probably salty licorice  okay candy covered is probably better-
I dont remember if the American version of the melody pop had a slider on it or not lol Also finally i got to see the talked about hockey pulver
This video gives me "smash or pass pokemon" video vibes 👌🏻
"There are no cats in Iceland" *Jólakötturinn intensifies*  Also getting Clangers flashbacks from the slide whistle
You should play frenni's nightclub you would like it
But hey that’s just a theory. A food theory!
YES! I love these reviews. After all, Markiplier is THE Islandic candy review channel.
I went to Italy 2 years ago, and we went to this resturaunt, and I swear the salad that came with dinner was the saltiest thing ive ever tasted. Nobody in our group ate it. Like Mark, I dont know what happened when making it.
The takeaway from this video is that the Icelandic have a borderline obsessive fondness for licorice and salt.
Damn this is the first markiplier video that popped up in my in feed in months
34:00 it's one of my favorite candy it's so GOOD (I'm Belgian)
Why do I feel like he's trying to be emo
After briefly scrolling through the comments, I gotta say I'm kinda surprised nobody's mentioned Toot Sweets from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.
"This is actually not good. I'm liking it less by the second. I dont want that in me anymore" got me cackling up 😂😂😂😂😂
My mom and I have always used red vines as a straw for rootbeer.
A channel called jammstudiomusic or something along those lines did an entire cover of Shake it Off on Melody pop.
I have a real good tips for you if you want to taste the wolds sour candy in the world? You gona taste Swensjävlar licorice. It is Swedes most salty and sour candy there is, and its rated as the numbers 1 most sour candy in the world. I can send you a jar to review on your channel
I love how probably half of these weren't even Icelandic. A lot of Danish and Swedish in there (obvi it's hard to tell when you don't know the languages).
stay tuned for the "shockingly salty" challenge with Mark, Wade, and Tyler using that one candy. (With Bob as cameraman)
We had that gum in the u.s. in the 90s
38:52
Get someone icelandic to pick for you next time 🤣
The Melody Pop, I definitely had all the time as a kid in the 90s early 2k lol. Definitely acted just like Mark when my mom got it for me lol😂
38:27 I have good news it is not blue licorice Realizes his mistakes  I have bad news its full of the same thing that one was.
1:33
Guys darkiplier appeared for a moment
Second candy, "must be icelandic" Candy bag with *printed Swedish flag*
What the hell happened to this guy. He actually used to be relatable...and funny. His content sucks now hahaa
Am I stupid or something or did he let out Chica, Henry, AND SPENCER?   What have I missed I’ve been gone from the internet for a few weeks
SPENCERRRR!!!!
i had ben waiting for this video for like 2 months, after i saw a video from a friend of a friend talking to mark in iceland in N1. and bro only picked like 30% of icelandic candy there :/
Just appreciating Marks lens love because the quality here is besutiful and as much fun as it is to make fun of Mark and his obsession with lenses it is paying off.
"Cats have been around in Iceland for centuries, or since Iceland was settled in 870. "
31:52 love the “wHat dA puK”
Getting Jack Sparrow vibes from this lewk
Ammonium Chloride is an odorless, white powder. Solid Ammonium Chloride is used to make dry batteries and Ammonia compounds, as a soldering flux, a pickling agent in Zinc coating and tinning, and a fertilizer.
Chicka; You whistle?
poor mark just wants a sponsorship with things he likes so bad. the ebike, this drink.... it's crazy that they don't sponsor him given that he's such a huge channel
Socker is suger in Swedish. Hockey powder in Sweden comes in 3 different flavours. Salmiac, sweet and sour.
"Ammonium chloride is a slightly toxic chemical most notably found in "salmiak," a salt licorice candy, which is popular in northern Europe.'
Melody pops was the best one here lol
It has been so long since he made one of these videos
Second comment. Turkish pebber is a Swedish hard candy. In Sweden, it is very common for candy to begin rather salty or sour, and we have brands of candles from both Denmark and Finland in the country as both brand and off brand candles. Iceland imports 60% of their candy from Sweden, Denmark, and Finland. But they produce authentic Icelandic candy that are similar to Swedish candy, and its little similar to Swedish candy.
Why is Mark just slowly becoming Captain Jack Sparrow?
I haven’t watched a markiplier video in years, and I gotta say, I’m so glad chica is doing so well
Watching mark struggle to read the packaging reminds me of sims talking 😅
Mark has a Mind?
I have a visceral reaction to people biting and chewing hard candy so this video was definitely a test for me 😭😭
i need everybody to understand that i work at a movie theater and that flavacol is POTENT. like. its ground salt ( not grainy) and if it poofs up because you dropped something in it your nose starts burning. there is .1 ounce of salt in the equivalent of 100 oz of popped popcorn
I would have used the transition jingle for the entire video so people were confused until they got the aha moment when the whistle makes its appearance 😂
i am bewildered by how well this man has aged, him jack and jerma must be drinking from a fountain of eternal youth or smth
Markiplier with the headband looks like Jack Sparrow
Love ya mark
As a Brit a few of these we have too, didn't know America didn't have them
YAY MARK IS REVIEWING AGAIN
Ethan's dog was there!
"Icelandic candy" *2nd candy having the swedish flag* 😂
The second candy is Swedish candy from the beginning, but Iceland took the candy and branded it offbrand as their own company. Iceland is cooperating with Sweden with some candy brands like Harbo and Cloettha. But 3 of 5 candles are Swedish from the beginning.  But you, as the number 1 candy Youtuber, know that from the first ever bite of every candy you put in your mouth. I feel sorry for sour patch kids for not giving you that rightful sponsorship you deserved a few years ago 👍
Mark:"My Grandma"  Us: 😐  Mark:"Is Korean " Us: 😅
Just FYI the Tubble Gum looks normal to me. I havent had it since I was a kid, but back then they werent sealed either lol.
6:00 i lost it there
You should try German candy/chocolate. It's the best! imho
Everywhere I go I’m seeing people say “It’s just a theory” and it makes my heart melt 🥹 MatPat would be proud ❤
Alternative title: I tried a lot of liquorice
The ones at 31:50 are my absolute favorite lol It doesn't taste like just salt to me. 😅
Did mark move?
It would be amazing to see Mark try candy from Portugal but actually have Lixian there in person to see his reactions and explain some stuff. That'll be amazing!   Or at least have Lixian send stuff over with small notes on them so Mark isn't THAT confused haha
Do Egyptian candy next
this is brilliant
I don’t have 2, but thank you for making me feel special. Breast cancer sucks! Love this video! Now I’m off to get some licorice ❤️
Love from iceland but here is the ones i can answer ❤ 1. icelandic 2. Swedish 3.icelandic 4.not icelandic 5. Icelandic 6.not icelandic 7.Finish  i think (the center is salmiak?)  8.not icelandic Ill add the rest when i can finish the vid
This video was a gold mine of expressions from mark.
It's probably a good thing Mark doesn't smoke weed. He'd practically shoot right off the goofy scale.
I think the cat thing is hilarious because   dogs actually used to be banned there were only cats😂 also please be careful with licorice, it can cause your potassium levels to drop😢🍌
I am Dutch and I know a lot of these lol. I do think that this is a palate you need to grow up with.
Ah, the newest addition to the fiber optic cable core series is pretty good
I remember those whistle candies from when I was a kid lol. Not so much flavor, but it was fun.
Hello markiepoo I was wondering if there were any chance of you to do a Norwegian candy review? -love broshly
I got to the 10mins mark, I cant with the chewing and lip smacking, not an asmr gal
I missed these style videos and Amy commentary :)
Petition for Mark to review german candy. Cant wait to see him chew on some Hanuta😈🤡
Mark does look like he’s about to captain the Flying Dutchman
mark putting the very few icelandic candies under not icelandic was so painful 😭
Interactions with Amy were by far the best part of this video
The liquid thing is supposed to have i seal i think
So what i`m guessing happened is that markiplier left iceland and everything went to shit immedieteæy afterward
Markiplier reviews licorice plus a few candy guest apperances
Captain Jack Sparrow, over here
Fist one reminds me of a Whatchamacallit from the USA
9:15 BUBBLE JUG!! Ah the early 90s was a great time to be alive. I'd buy this version but it seems it's out of stock everywhere.
I would like the little candy tune to continue in the future, it is too adorable to waste
Why is he dress like an 80s rockband member
Mark saying he got sweets from Iceland sounds very different to my British ears as we have frozen food stores here called ''Iceland'......so that British gum powder probably coulda come from Iceland......looks like you can retire now Mark
Hi I'm Icelandic and made it past 6 so I can give some insight (If people want some translations/pronunciations lemme know)  This is long so tldr: Marks score was 15 / 22   Jólaköttur = The Christmas cat candy that is indeed Icelandic! ❌️ Gränna = Swedish, not Icelandic, but generally popular here❌️ Trítlar = Icelandic as fuck, they're better sour in my opinion ✅️ Jerrycan gum = Not Icelandic oh dear sweet Mark ❌️ Lakkrísrúlla = Staple of Icelandic candy with marzipan in the middle that's heavenly ❌️ Chocolate peppermint = Don't recognize the packaging and it doesnt say súkkulaði so I'm guessing its not Icelandic but this combo is kinda popular in Iceland so... ✅️ Tyrkisk pepper = Not Icelandic but super popular ✅️ Candy whistle = Not Icelandic but looks hella cool ✅️ Nipples = Swedish, not Icelandic. Don't remember seeing these nipples before so I can't vouch for their popularity (nipple is geirvarta in Icelandic and it's one of the ugliest words ever) ✅️ Hokeypulver = Not Icelandic but suuuuper popular here ❌️ Pinballs = Not Icelandic but Maoam candy is popular ✅️ Súper Sett = Icelandic and classic, the liquorice chocolate combo is super popular here ✅️ Ópal = Weird Ópal flavour to choose, not the classic one (which is similar to the black one) but really Icelandic✅️ Bismark mint = Again not sure on the packaging. Could be made in Iceland but not native to us I think ❌️ Djöflar = Icelandic made but it has salmiak which is Finnish in origin, so blame the Finnish pls ✅️ Tubble gum = Not Icelandic (but a childhood memory) ✅️ Þristur = Mmmmmmm Icelandic goodness ✅️ Skole krit = Not Icelandic but def popular ✅️ Tyrkisk pepper = Again not Icelandic ✅️ Frisia tongue painter = I have never seen this? Not Icelandic ✅️ Lakkrísrör = Claaaassic Icelandic, they just need some Appelsín for that ✅️ Lakrids by Bülow = Not Icelandic but popular with people that have money ❌️
''they don't have American food safety standards'' that means its *definitely* safe.
Food safety packaging is a lot like airport safety... A lot of show to make you feel better ;) if Adam Conover is to be believed.
5:00 marks immediate frown killed me bro 😂
Mark just absolutely taken back by Salmiakki XD I love me some Salmiakki
mark kind of looks like my uncle
Tyrkisk pepper is Danish in Pretty sure. The text is Danish anyway. And we have it here and have had for as long as i can remember  Socker is sugar, lakrids pulver is liquice powder. It was probably a bad salmiak powder  The inside of Turkish pepper is liquice powder
wait....what happened? last thing i remember is Mark saying ''I want you to enter my mind'' and that was it until i just woke up........2 days later!! WTF HAPPENED?! and why do I smell like lava and Christopher Nolan?
1:46 DARKIPLIER!?!
You Icelandians are your licorice 😏
Book people, cut marks growl from the second candy!
I just really need more of Mark reviewing products 😂 Also more Chica content, we miss seeing her 🥲♥️
Do Americans not have maoams? they do loads of great stuff!
I see German Candy - I like / Subscribe  / activate Bell 😁😁
marker plier
49:17 When did they get “Spencer”?! Very good boy. ❤
Felt like there was a episode of the clangers on when you was playing with the melody pop. My daughter loves them….I’ve grown to tolerate them
Tyrkisk Peber is Danish :) and directly translated means "Turkish Pepper". Skole Kridt as well!!! "School Chalk". Lakrids by Bülow is also Danish:) (which is the one he liked in the end) Also a lot of different other Scandinavian candy in this video :) Also also why did you only buy liquorice???
Fazer is a Finnish brand and as a Finnishman I'm proud to say that! Tyrkisk Peber is actually pretty enjoyable in small portions!!
Fazer is a Finnish brand 😔 ö
Airheads oversell spice?
Is this mark's jack sparrow arc? 😂
I'm so glad Mark has now experienced the taste assault of salty licorice in almost every Scandi & North European country. It is insane.
As you noticed on the second item it was indeed the swedish flag, and also written in swedish.  Gränna is a place in Sweden famous for inventing the "polkagris" which u ate at 29:10
the whistle between each candy made the whole video just so much better it’s insane
25:03 the scream 🤣
I love how these should be Icelandic candies and yet already the second product is a Swedish one!
Those skole kridt candies you got can be used to draw. We used them in school to draw hopskotch when we couldn't find chalk. It's a thing. :D
Did anyone else get chitty chitty bang bang nastalgia from the whistle candy? :0
love how half of these are Swedish xD
He be sporting a solid snake headband.
34:27 Nah, that’s completely normal 😂 that doesn’t come sealed
18:43 LOL... Mark making music with that melody pop , right uuuuuup into the mic like that, might be my favorite moment of all time WAHAH followed by Marks' "oh em gee!" face slightly after when he got a proper note out! lol
What's the thing about Chica not having legs? I haven't watched Mark in a long time. Is it a joke or is Chica actually disabled?
I love seeing mark ate our candy, this was so funny even thoe you don’t than there cats here
41:39 mark was about to say "editor" :0
The flute candy 100/10
Ammonium Chloride, or salmiak is in all the salty flavoured candy from the nordic countries. xD At some point in time, liqorice was an expensive and exotic product here and only the rich would afford it. So people started using ammonium chloride to replace liqorice and it just so happened, purely coincidentally that people enjoyed it more than liqorice. :P
Salmiak is the weird taste, so look for that word on ingredient lists 😂 31:51
I love people finding out the taste of salmiak and hating it, salmiak is so yummy :)
Basically all the liquorice is from Sweden
We have many of them in sweden and the "nipples" is mushrooms not nipples
Please do South African candy one day, you will love it. Eg. Nick Naks, Chomp, Chappies, Simba Chips, Speckled Eggs, Jelly Tots, Fizzers,  Wine Gums, Tex, Flings, Smarties,  Bar One, Lunch Bar, Romantics, and Shockers.
4:25 LoL Mark, still be doing the pirate thing with this candy name "Hyarrrrr"  hehe
Bülow is so fucking good. Best part is, it's coverd in the same pwder they's the hocky powder, and in the Tyrkisk Pepper. Lol.
Can you do Turkish candy please
Jæja, hversu margi íslendigar eru hér
Mark freaking out about the Tyrkisk Peber is really funny to me - I'm basically addicted to the repulsive taste he can't stand, it's up there as my faves because of that not-quite-hot-but-definitely-aggressive flavor. In defense of the flames, though, us Nordic people are the whitest of white, so any aggressive flavor becomes considered 'spicy'. The only spice we really know is licorice
21:30 We have those in my country too and if you translate literally what we call those types of candy, you’d call them foamies 😂
MARK, FELIX IS FROM SWEDEN, YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT THE SWEDISH FLAG LOOKS LIKE OMG
'' pirate eats nipple candy ''
THE TUBBLEGUM!!! I remember it from 12 years ago or so, my sister and I used to love it so much
Volcano phobic 🌋
wasnt there a volcano eruption in iceland this month???????
I remember when hubba bubba used to make bubble gum jugs like that in the United states 😭
maybe we should be careful about volcanoes?  THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS VOLCANOES!
Anyone else curious why Spencer was with them???? 41:21
We have those raspberry and liquorice candy in sweden to
Damn that turkish peber was my childhood candy over in Denmark throughout my entire middleschool years. I kinda hoped you liked it hahah.
Lixian is the best at editing
I'm not Icelandic but GOOD GOD I WANT TO TRY SCANDINAVIAN CANDY 😞 On my mothers side I'm Swedish and Norwegian
I need you to personally look up why it's called a "Jerry" can
List of the Icelandic candy: Jólaköttur (Yule cat) Trítlar (not sure how to translate, but this one is my personal favorite) Stjörnu Rúlla (Star roll) Súper Sett (Super Set) Djöflar (Devils) Risa Þristur (Giant Triple) if I forgot anything, feel free to add to the list
ضيعت عشر دقايق من حياتي
Why does mark look more and more Korean every year
Mark: There are no cats in Iceland Iceland, being one of the most cat friendly countries and home to so many cat lovers ever: O_O
Fun fact: the Turkish pepper candy is actually Finnish! Made by the company fazer and I hate that candy but everyone i know fuckin loves it 😊 (hi from finland) ps. The candy is called 'turkin pippuri' in Finnish
It was indeed a Swedish flag
Mark try house of ashes great horror game
"From any number of Nordic countries ... might even be Dutch!" Thanks, Mark. This *Danish* person ain't whether the Netherlands wanna take our place in the group, though I'm pretty sure the others might be very willing to push us out /jk  Wanna point out I ain't mad at all, it's quite funny to me how often this mistake happens, but after being at the Live Show where Ethan *also* called us Dutch I think I'm sensing a pattern here.
I don't understand the concept of non-alcoholic beer. Beer is disgusting. All of it. The only function it serves as a beverage is to induce drunkenness.
A lot of this "icelandic" candy seems to come from sweden for some reason.
The "AHHHH" sound effect when that one went flying killed me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Turkisk peber is not icelandic it maybe is sold there but Im pretty sure its swedish
I think you mean Danish, not Dutch 😭😭
CHICA!!!!!
Just wanna say the extremely salty licorice, which is often known as either salmiak or salmiakki, is made with ammonium chloride, which is used to make dry batteries and ammonia compounds. So essentially the candy is licorice mixed with ammonia, that’s why it is so salty. It’s also not native to Iceland. It is originally from Finland. It started as a medicine but ended up becoming a confectionary in the 1920’s. (My family ancestry is largely from Nordic and Scandinavian countries and largely Finland and we very much like to stay in touch with our roots which is why I know this, I just know a bunch of random facts that has to do with Nordic and Scandinavian countries)
When you explain bubble gum dust and I get to be reaffirmed that you are as aware of your surroundings as I am. You are genuinely awesome.
Realizing I can watch Mark just eat stuff, as a form of entertainment.
I’m so thrilled this video is so long
DO FNAF HELP WANTED 2
What is that background music???????
Mark is like Tom Hanks mixed with Dave Grohl with a sprinkle of mischief
21:40 I thought I was about to be attacked for having a third nipple
So why is mark a pirate?
11:24 mark😅 you’re not retiring right? right mark? mark?
27:00 instant regret 🤣💀
7:50 my man got gojo’d
Rip to headphone users, I tried listening to this with my earbuds and it was an ASMR nightmare of mouth smackies 😭😭
So the first candy is authentically Icelandic and the Yule cat is a legend of a cat who eats children that don’t receive clothes for Christmas
This has taught me to not go to Iceland for the candy because I despise licorice
Common turkinpippuri W
im sorry but he seriously looks like Edward Teach
Ok so after a quick translate session Jóllaköttur translates to Christmas Cat. The second was was apparently a swedish one that roughly translated to Hearty Goodies from Gränna.
My uncle lived in Iceland for a short time, and he STILL complains that he can’t get his hands on Mark’s salty hellscape. Loves that candy 😂
Y’all just really gonna ignore that mark looks like a pirate in this video?
5:53 flaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaG
Scandinavian countries sure like their ammonium chloride
review german candy next pls love from germany
10:16 yeh because american food safety standards are a global laughing stock
19:06 lol is that chica in the back? she heard that whistle
i like how he just stops rating them at some point
> has Swedish flag > puts in icelandic category  and then called dutch nordic ahahhahahahh
Eitt sett and opals are ours too
10:19 American food SAFETY standards xddddd with them toxic chemicals yummy
Markiplier slaps in video opening…          TOP OF THE MORNIN TO YA!
12:27 that seems like german lukurish (i can't spell ok)
1:41  I think I'd feel pretty comfortable with being trapped in marks mind.
two actual icelandic ones where the Jólaköttur and the apollo roll the "authentic" pile on your table was all imported garbage 🤣 trítlar are also icelandic.. dude you seriously need to come back and get a better tour
The Melody candy music made my dog fear fart. Just wanted to share
33:15 hey speaking of which did anyone else shake stuff from the salt & pepper shakers at the restaurant table into their hand and eat it when hungry and waiting for the food as a kid?
Solid Ammonium Chloride is used to make dry batteries and Ammonia compounds, as a soldering flux, a pickling agent in Zinc coating and tinning, and a fertilizer. I don't think that was candy Mark.
27:31  "That's very... not good..." 😂😂😂
the utter chaos contained in markiplier's taste review videos will forever make me laugh and cringe throughout.
them nailsssssssssssssssssssss
Next time you come here I'll give you a localized authentic showaround the place
i wanna go to iceland so bad omg
And yes.. Iceland has cats.. I'm bummed to have missed you... those suckers after the Cat chocolate was not authentic
love how once the whistle starts to work properly one of his dogs shows up in the background.
Jólaköttur means christmas cat.. Its authentic
Anyone else got flashbacks from knj old video of trying that hockey puck shit too? Wanting to see if I got any knj and mark fans 😂
I am Icelandic
Everytime the whisle plays my puppy Opal comes to me 😂
OMG AMY CONTENT I LOVE YOU AMY
Woooohoooo!! shoutout from Iceland!
why does mark sound like he's speaking Simlish?
Mark: *Takes one bite* I have good news, its not licorice. *Takes one more bite* I have bad news...
Salmiak (amonia chlorid) ain't for faint hearted Americans 😅😂
I'm starting to love the jingle.
"They don't have _America's_ food safety standards, heh-heh."  Best joke in the video xD
oh god salt licorice, my sister's dutch grandma loved it and I like normal licorice so I remember as a kid being all "ooo I like licorice, this is licorice". It was a mistake. It tastes like a salty piece of old boot. Not just salty but kinda funky and dirty tasting. Apparently the amonia salt is what makes it so much more salty than regular salt. From what I was told the salt licorice is a real acquired taste. If you grew up with it you get a taste for it or something. But damn it's strong.
Packing peanuts are edible
Mark! On the melody candy when you fully off the wrapper, you can see melodies on the inside of the wrapper!
The whole "there are no cats in iceland" think is very funny to me.  I'm not Icelandic, but one of the only things I know of in Icelandic folklore is the Yule Cat
I find it funny that he thought the swedish candy was Icelandic  For those who also don't know their flags, yes, it was the swedish flag, and gränna is a place in sweden aswell Also, "hjärtligt gott från gränna" (very) roughly translates to "heartful goodness from gränna"
When danish is called dutch yet again :_)
It's not a nipple... It's a mushroom 😂😂😂
As an American, living in the Netherlands, I saw Mark's face and I was immediately shrieking "IS THAT SALMIAK?!?!?!?" both times. Because when I first got sick here, my partner got me salmiak cough syrup and it was EXACTLY the same facial expression that I felt on my own face. The experience is OH GOD, WHAT IS THIS HELLVOID SUCKING AWAY AT MY TONGUE?! He and Amy are NOT exaggerating and 0% wrong--it is somehow saltier THAN LITERAL SALT. Licorice enhances the salty taste of salt x1000.  My partner thought I was being dramatic but no. There is no more vile brine flavor on earth that will not cause you to actually die and that is the truth.
He sounds like he’s tryna cast a spell on me when he reads the names 😂
the ammonium chloride in the licorice-type candies is meant to give them that "salty" taste. As someone who grew up on some of those flavors, I personally like them, but I can see how it is an acquired taste
Iceland does have cats. Famously the giant Yule Cat is from Iceland.
U gotta try Finnish candies it would make a hilarious vid
The whistling throughout the video is killing me😂
27:27 dunno why but caught me off guard, got me really laughing. Nice one, lixian.
This is rather europian candy than icelandic lol
A very common middle school science experiment in Denmark is to make that amonium chloride stuff by mixing hydrochloric acid and ammonium, and then eating it afterwards.
Mark just sitting there looking like Solid Snake and vibing.
Is it just me or did marks little whisteling sound just like scandinavian childhood. like those old tv programs for kids? and In tyrkisk peber (Turkish Pepper) there is in fact fine pepper. nice ne Mark. loved the video here from denmark. Nice to see how much Danish candy there is in Iceland.
1:35 i never kissed my monitor so fast
As a Norwegian I don't want our country to get excluded from this (potential) scandinavian candy party.
"Gränna" is a City in sweden =)
Used to have a similar product in the US to the sneaky bubbledust, called bubble jug.
i like baking soda candy
happy I just bought a 4k monitor for this (also, nice seeing the video that mark talked about on distractible (go listen to the podcast))
Your favorite, the chocolade covered liquorice is actually danish and its very good😊
hi, i'm icelandic, currently watching this in a volcano 👍 also i didnt know there were no cat's here, so i guess my cat was a dog this whole time
Can I get someone to identify Mark's Jacket and where to get it?
Is it differently different?
mark has THREE DOGS NOW? AWWWW
The dogs are adorable  though I'm curious about the name of the 3rd dog as I only know Henry and Chica.
MARK WHERES THE NEW FNAF HELP WANTED 2 EPISODE ITS BEEN 0.01 NANOSECONDS TOO LONG 😡😡🤬
Mark the video is over I wanna go home please release us from your mind
ive learned icelandic and swedish candy is DISGUSTING. licorice is the worlds most hated flavor for candy too lmfao. really disgusting
Day 1 of asking Markimoo to play Zoochosis
Why do icelandics like liquorice so much???????
I loved it when Mark became one of the clangers with the whistle xD massive nostalgia hit
At 44:38 on the side of the can it says .5% alc/vol…. No one else see it but me? 😂
19:44 I blame him for scaring my guniea pigs. Lord. 😂 Love the candy review btw.  Edit: 22:12 imagine if he went out with friends and he open a contaner of this with everyone else thinking its crack. Like some of these products are weird. They shouldn't be candy at all. 😂
Tasting swedish candy next? Please
Such cute puppys
the unidentifiable flavor is actually just gasoline
i am just sooooooooooooo dissapointed for u thinking cats dont live in iceland man :( you have failed us
Holding the package with a giant swedish flag: "this is icelandic"
Markiplier U never did 7/20 mode in Five nights at chum buckets could you do it soon?
Why does Meek lookS like a pirate XS

I love this Video so much I rate it 99999999999.9999999999.99999999999M/10
i loved his reaction on those finnish candys so much<3
I Highly suggest looking up ammonium chloride! It is not good for you!
Fun fact! Hjärtligt gott från Gränna is swedish and I live next to Gränna which is the famous town that makes the candy, and is quite well known!
the candys with the flag you thought maybe was the swedish flag was the swedish flag and the candy is also swedish and you are swedish everyone you ever have known is swedish earth is swedish the moon is swedish EVERYTHING is swedish
There are many different types of Maoam in 23:16. And I’m not just talking about the pinballs. there are strips, sticks, blocks, and normal candy version of Maoam and they’re delicious. Also, Mark is correct they are not Icelandic candy. Their origins are based in Germany but you can get them anywhere in the UK and in Ireland.
Volcanoes aren't real!!!
I feel special now with 3 nipples thanks Mark 😂💕
Mark, please, release me from your mind. My family misses me
1'st, SWEDEN!!! God damn it! Felix, help!  Now try Svenskjävlar 😆 If you think those Djöflar are strong 😉
can you pls play geometry dash 2.2 It's a huge update
The way Mark moves his hands while reviewing the candy make him look even more like Jack Sparrow 😂
O love how this went from an Icelandic candy "review" to just guessing if the candy was in-fact Icelandic or not 🤣 Also, when's the candy flute EP droppin'?
Finally Lixion and Mark banter we've missed that for so long
The candy: “Ahhhhhahh!” 😂
35:05 That is toothpaste.
I've moaom and it's actually quite a big thing here in the UK
Mark drinking beer through a straw reminded me of when me and my parents were on vacation, there was a little fun contest at the hotel in the evening. My dad got up on stage and was challenged with drinking two glasses of beer through a straw, maybe within a time frame, something like that. A tiny shoutout to Estrella del Mar, you were a great hotel.
Can’t stop laughing
"Hey Mark, how tall are you?"  Mark: 6:15
He clearly does not like liquorice powder
Hey Mark lol we bought some candy when we had a layover in the Icelandic airport and they were...bad just tasted too sweet and nothing else
Question: It's been 3 months... What happened to the Iron Lung?
Judging from the extended of the blow I'm willing to bet mark played the recorder I svhool
Want to try salty candy, try SVENSKJÄVLAR, i double dare you 🤣
aw didn’t expect spencer to be there❤️
Finally more review content
Welcome to the world of real liquorice.
How dare you not finish the trítlar
am i the only one that remembers having gum out of those small plastic "gas can" containers as a kid here in the states?
In this episode, Mark discovers the nordic countries' flair for weaponized salt licorice,
40:05 you welcome
Hello everyone I got flipped off behind this car going literally 0 miles per hour and idk why he got so mad will someone please say something nice before I go to class :)
this must surely be why mums go to iceland
I can’t tell you how the guy always falling after a dropped candy piece/crumb is Genius! Laugh every time.
Poor Amy gagging on the salmiakki. Ahaha. I relate. 😆
Why is Mark dressed like Deacon St. John from Days Gone in this lmao
Idk for sure but i think the candy at 36:50 is dutch, im dutch and see that stuff everywhere especially at authentic dutch candy stores. We call em schoolkrijtjes
The melody pop is such a staple of my childhood. Ty for the memories! ❤
I love when the jingle 21:45 hahah ty everyone for the laughs.
Hey Mark, I know you won't see this but could you please try the game "Anomaly Agent". I'd love to see you try it! Love your content <3
Lixion is the true goat
For Wade's birthday could you revisit 7 days to die?
I want you to enter my mind
As somebody bornand raised in Iceland If Its from Nóa Síríus,Góa or Freyja then Its full icelandic Now for the Candy counter Candy number  1 Icelandic we do have cats   2 not Icelandic yes that’s the  Swedish flag   3 Icelandic yes according to most folktale we will die  4 not Icelandic powder gum?  5 Icelandic one of my favourite candies   6 not Icelandic yes that shit will break your teeth   7 not Icelandic it’s Turkish I think   8 not Icelandic but we do have an ice cream named trúðaís that has a kazoo thingi  9 not Icelandic that’s the Swedish flag on the packaging again   10 not Icelandic but pretty loved in Iceland   11 not Icelandic but they do taste good   12 Icelandic finally it’s one of the oldest chocolate bars still being made the it was recently changed tho to have the licorice inside instead of on top  13 Icelandic it always has a old candy feel but it’s a really loved candy here  14 not Icelandic just mint candy  15 Icelandic there are cats in my town there are more cats than people and this candies is literally named devils 😅  16 not Icelandic but this is my childhood   17 Icelandic we don’t use waiver we use liquorice  that’s what it is because we love it it’s like 90% of our candy is liquorice 😅  18 not Icelandic my dad’s favourite tho  19 not Icelandic again I think it’s Turkish   20 not Icelandic it tastes and feels like styrofoam   21 Icelandic it is indeed a straw most people just eat it instead of drinking anything through it  22 not Icelandic   This is finally over this has been torture we make so much candy here but he barely got any and this is by far the longest comment I have written
I remember annoying the cr*p out my mum with those whistle pops as  kid.
Much Love from Iceland <3 Sad I couldn't meet you tho T-T
I sat down to drink coffee and watch but by the time the intro ended I was down with my coffee 😂
alot of these candys are all over eruop, we here in denmark actualy have invented alot of them, im proud to mention the tyrkis peber as a dansih invention.
37:02 I think that’s ‘schoolkrijt’ in dutch, which means (school)chalk. It’s sweet licorice in a thin hard coat. I do like it, the taste and texture are very funky
Was that the Bite of 87 💀
this is so portuguese
15:05 TYRKISK PEBER MENTION YIPPIE
You look like the warrior from the desert in the first mummy movie.
Someone give him scissorrr
Did anyone else's dog head turn a full 90° when Mark lollipop whistled?😂
Mark should try British Candy
Try german candy's
Mark asmr Mark asmr!!!!!
Tyrkisk peber is actually from Denmark, so you guessed correctly:3 And the “nipples” as mark calls them, they’re actually mushrooms😭
Liquorice all the way down.
Raspberry x Liquorice is actually kinda common at least in northern/middle europe
10:15 I love this moment lol, the cockiness so swiftly shifting to apprehension, just to be dismissed to eat dust out of a jerry can.
Maoam pinballs are literally one of my favorite candy ever, and I don't even like candy that much!
A lot of these are actually candy that's popular in the Netherlands, like the whistle one and the tubble gum, and especially the maoam brand
Why is markiplier high in this video
half the candies are literally just swedish, im going insane (i am swed)
on the second one that is definatly a swedish flag  -from a swedish person  "edit" alot were swedish btw lakris is swedish word for liqurice  -also from a swedish person
Maoam pinballs are my favourite sweets and it’s making me so unbelievably happy to see mark enjoy them
43:41 was legendary
I'm from Iceland lol
Tyrkisk pepper is one of my favorite candies. The mysterious flavor in the center was ammonia and liqorice, and I love it. Hockeypulver is also really good, you're supposed to dip your tongue in it. Yes, I'm scandinavian.
As a Dane who has never been to Iceland (yet), I can't say if some of these are specifically from there, but as a Scandinavian I could recognize almost all of these. It is so funny to see Mark react to candy from my childhood!   When he ate the liquorice/raspberry hard candy I _immedaetely_ thought of the ones with chocolate/peppermint, and was very happy he tried those as well. Those were a stable in my grandma's house. Also the "nipples" are supposed to be marshmallow mushrooms, and I could easily devour a whole bag of them! They come in pink and brown. Also pretty sure the Opal candy is similar to our Gajol, and you're supposed to suck on them, not chew them 😂 Tyrkisk Peber means Turkish Pepper, and the center has liquorice powder. They are more black pepper "spicy" than chili hot.  But yeah, we really like our sweet and salty liquorice, weird chocolate and hard candy. Also anything MAOAM rocks! Bülow is a Danish brand, and they make _amazing_ but expensive chocolate-coated and normal liquorice.
Ohh man I miss the old set up where the camera was showing the white table with marks half body in it.
Looking at how hard the licorice straw is, I think it could replace paper straws
If Mark wants to eat some real liqorice he needs to try Finnish ones
The gum that punched Mark in the Phallus
YES, MY FAVORITE GENRE OF MARKIPLIER
Y'arrrkiplier tries Icelandic candy.
No one gonna ask why Spenser is there
"Its not my grandma, my grandma is GREEK"--Markiplier--2024  "Don't bite into it." *continues to bite it*"--MARKIPLIER--2024
Please review Swedish Candt. Plus it's kind of a trend right now
Mark is the worlds best candy whistle player
Watching Mark struggle to open candy for nearly 50 minutes
the fact i have that exact same jacket is so cool.
When are you tasting Danish candy
yea mark none of these are from Iceland.. :3
TYRISK PEBER???? DENMARK MENTIONED RAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH
Can you pls make a video trying candy from Sweden, Finland and Denmark so us Scandinavians finally get to know who's the best? Cause who's better to judge that then an American, and HOCKEY PULVER IS SWEDISH😭 even though it's disgusting (I hate it)
25:33 we need more happy amy, happy amy is my favourite amy
most of the candy was swedish 💀
Wasnt there a gum like that in the 90’s called jug?
Did anyone else notice that when Mark was playing the candy whistle that his dog came into the room ( lower right part of screen)  Lol he was summoned. 😂 19:05
This is fan service to anyone Scandinavian, and I’m very here for it!! Also, yes mark that’s the Swedish flag😂🇸🇪🇸🇪
"Happy Amy Noises" with the yum
the Tyrkisk Peber candy from Fazer is a Finnish candy which tastes of salmiac and has a peber ish powder in the middle
i like how mark went for the willy wonka whistle but failed
Whenever a markiplier tries video appears, im happy all day
the second one was swedish btw
The lil gas canister of gum brought me back to the 90s with hubba bubba bubble jug nostalgia lol.
Hello everybody my name is Mindiplier
You're going to get a slat ulcer on your  tongue .or in your mouth.
That second one definitely looks Swedish lmao. Hockey Pulver is salty licorice powder. Gross lmaooo. Every time the whistle sound plays I die laughing.
Now we need markiplier to try Poland candy!
The king of  fnaf is BACK!!!
Hello Mark and others, So Frisia is a dutch candy producer based in Friesland. Moaom is from a german candy producer Haribo. The hockey puck had Ammonium chloride in it, normally called salmiak. Salmiak is also often to be found together with licorice.
We have whistle pops... good times..
any of the 5 people from Iceland actually here?
Jesus Christ is the only way repent and believe in the gospel
The things that mark called "n*pples" were mushrooms, right? Because we got similar ones in Germany and I absolutely love them  Edit: Als ob es Maoam in Island gibt
Can you play poppy playtime chapter 3
I find it so funny that mark looks like a pirate. Wearing the little Bandina around his head and on top of that its kind of hot.
Lixian did a very good job editing this video ( whistle tone)😂💀
Raspberry and licorice sounds like those assorted Christmas hard candies in grandma's candy dish on the coffee table surrounded by little family photos.
Oh shit í didn't realise mark came to iceland, I'm so sad í didn't get the chance to meet em =(  Tho I do hope ya had a wonderful time here in iceland, oh and just so you know, in iceland j is more so pronounced like y
“ What do you mean,its a little close that’s the whole point”- Markiplier 2024
Det är en SVAMP! XD
Finallyyyyyy after all these years MARK IS EATINGGGGGG!!!!!!
I'm Lithuanian and oh boy how badly I want Mark to try Lithuanian snacks/candies. We have some weird candies. If I could I would send him some.  The maoam - haribo balls are german candy. Love them, my favorite Haribo candy type
The scream when the candy went flying almost made me spit my coffee lmao
Mork, trim your nose hairs.
Why are you doing a johnny Depp cosplay.
31:49 how is no one taking about that 💀
melody pops also have a note sheet in the wrapper
Does Mark have Spencer?!
Likris
Editing is top tier
🇮🇸
It something
Good to see lixian trolling mark again XD
As a Scandinavian I laughed my ass off 😂 I love all of those treats
As a Scandinavian I know all of those flavours instantly and by heart ❤
Like half of these, a lot of wich Mark put in the Iceland pile were Swedish.
🇩🇰
The Tyrkisk Peber sweets are filled with ammonium chloride powder lol
Write in the comments if you know what it is well as a Dane I know it’s candy covered licorice and “Skole kridt” (what it said on the packaging) means School chalk like writing chalk your welcome.   And the stuff mark don’t know what is is called salmiak
We need more irl video from Mark who's agree?? 🙋🏻‍♂️♥️
man i just stumbled upon this small humble youtube channel and i just wana say good job and keep uo the good work!! i have a feeling you'll become really famous!!
As an Icelandic person I am so happy you tried Djöflar (that super salty liquorice), they're my absolute favorite
When he said if you betray me I was like Oh no Darkiplier is back! 😬😓😦😧😨😰😥😱 Oh and by the way I understood that lakris meant licorice since it in my opinion sounds similar to the Swedish word for licorice and that word is lakrits, I am Swedish by the way. Socker means sugar on Swedish byt the way. 🙂 I also think that licorice is so gross, YUCK! 😬🤢🤮 but, I love chocolate and gummy and hard candies and snacks, cakes, soda, and cookies, since I have a sweet tooth! 😋🤎❤
Any of my swedish brothers getting nostalgic from that hockey puck?
review serbian candy next
him bashing tyrkisk peber broke my fragile finnish heart
"Hjärtligt gott från Gränna" menans "Hearty goodness from Gränna" and is in swedish (as you said, it is the swedish flag on the package). This is not Icelandic candy, it is Swedish. Gränna is a town in southern Sweden that are famous for candy canes (polkagrisar). Turkisk Peber (Turkish pepper) is from Fazer, so it's Finnish and I think its salmiak powder on the inside of them. But many swedes like it (I love it). Hockeypulver (Hockey powder) is also Swedish and is suuper good! We used to add small droplets of water so it became like a paste, then use it as "snus" (chewing tobacco).  But, at least most of it is nordic! So, it's something I guess! :D
15:59 "maybe in the center?" start to bite 16:07 was not having it 31:20 opens dioflar 31:41 start eating it 31:45 what the fugjk?!
Mark: Plays candy flute. My dog, the entire time: Please stop! 🥺
Ok but why are you dressed like Jack Sparrow
You know..... In Japan, they have KitKat Bar which is has vegetables like "Carrot flavour bar, Green Letuce and Tomato flavour"
Okay but like I absolutely love Marks hair, he is part of the reason i shaved the hair I was growing out for 4 years, so I could regrow it to something like his 🤣 Maybe if I’m lucky my hair will begin to look even 10% as good as his
43:30 - 50 is hilarious
Yeah you're not supposed to eat Ammonium chloride.... it is a type of salt and probably oksy in small amounts like a lot of things but it can lead to complicated digestive track issues. But idk how much will do it, so probably a lot.
4:40 It was swedish, swedes love licorice and especially with raspberry or salt, really popular candy flavor. 21:56 That's also not icelandic and swedish and translates too hockey dust, once again, think it's supposed to be salt plus licor.
ag
Markiplier please play fnaf 2 deluxe edition
We eat a lot of salt. My grandfathers taste buds are nearly gone and he adds salt to everything. We have a dish that is called saltkjöt, (salty meat) and he even adds salt to that😂😂
Mark you better not retire like matpat did
The volcano gaslighting <3
I hate how Mark doesn't realize that most of the stuff is supposed to melt in your mouth not grind your teeth to dust
the salty stuff is called ”salmiakki” in finland and it’s loved by many finns, it’s definitely an aquired taste lol
You should try the licorice covered in licorice in licorice sauce with licorice sprinkles, it's the best licorice in Licorice.
Ohh we have those chocolate licorice in the netherlands too, it's weird but pretty good
salty
Mark: it might come from any number of nordic countries. Just because I can't read package doesn't mean it's Icelandic. It could be Swedish, could be Norwegian, could be . . . Dutch  Me (a Dutch person): We are a nordic country?
oh my god we have the nipples (mushrooms) over here in germany, but in pink-white instead of gray, and ive been looking for them for MONTHS, theyre not available in any local stores, but i KNOW they exist here also good call on the maoam, those are german XD!
As an icelandic person I can tell ya that if you go to Iceland mostly the chocolate and licorice compinations are 100% icelandic,iceland is very known for that 😎👌
I think what happened with the tubble gum was that I think a kid got into this candy shop saw that decided to try it didn’t like it and put it back because kids do be like that sometimes and usually when something is a different color and looks like there’s less of it that probably means saliva got into it, which saliva does digest things a little bit and often forms a syrup on sweet things
cosplay a pirate
feel like the licorice straw would go crazy in like. a hot boozy milky drink
that is just nordic candy in general. They all have liquorice
Melody pops are a classic in australia, i love them
Love when he became a Clanger for a good solid minute with the melody pop.
play shipwrecked 64
Never really put a lot of thought into it before but seeing Mark turn to talk to lixian while someone else is actually standing in the room watching him talk to empty space puts that whole bit in a funnier perspective. Like I know thats just what he always does but your disbelief is pretty well suspended until you have to picture it from a first person pov
The sudden crunch and change in facial expression at 26:55 just left me dying
Noo not tyrkisk peber it is one of my favourites.
the Turkish Pebers were actually Finnish candies! their packaging is a little missleading as they're not as much "hot" as they're rather spicy due to the salmiakki (ammoniumchloride) powder in the middle.  Would love to see Mark trying out propper Finnish candy, like soft liqourice, fazer chocolates etc. !
Mark: *questions the Icelandic authenticity of the candy.*  Googleplier: *annoyed af points at his head* THE ANSWER IS HERE! I HAVE THE ANSWER RIGHT FUCKING HERE!
Those UFO candies are basically the same as communion wafers.
Putting those lenses to good use I see.
i dont know how markimoo doesnt like mint chocolate
As a swede I realise how much alike the Nordic countries candies are😂
Hjärtligt gott från Gränna is Swedish candy. There's even a Swedish flag on the bag.
I'm glad Mark's got the Dominos Hatsune Miku commercial extreme close up side cam going the whole video.
The nipple ones I think are actually mushrooms if you turn them the other way up
I've ate chupa chups lollipops my entire life 🥹🥺
hi
How has this man not aged? Been watching off and on for years and mark has forever looked the same. Half convinced he was never a baby. Just came out a full grown man
36:10 he sounds like cheech lmao
U keep saying there's no cat ion iceland and the jolakaturin is gunna get you
Tyrkisk Peber is Finnish candy
Hi Mark!!!
Being in marks mind is crazy
I wanna hear the candy whistle in more videos now
Lixian i love you so much.

Mark Reviews returns ?!  What’s next more simulator games …
Mark Sparrow?!
I love Lexian's editing and sense of humor!
25:27 *Happy Amy noises* “Mhmmmm” 🤣
Fun facts: People think that it's called Iceland either because it has ice in it, or because it grew from the Norse word "Island," but it's actually named after the country of Iceland
mark is starting to look like Captain Jack Sparrow
I knew the moment he read "salmiakki" that he was going to have a bad time hahahah amazing
I’ve always loved the review videos
I am willing to bet that half of the people watching at 43:35 thought "Would be funny if Mark went 'it's just a theory' haha" and then when he actually DID we all just collectively felt intense joy and a stab of pain at the same time 🥲❤
Legitimately sounds like he’s speaking simlish when he tries to read the packaging lmao
Why does mark look like Jack Sparrow?
I did some research on ammonium chloride and it said in quote “cause serious injury to the gastrointestinal tract and pulmonary systems” 💀💀💀

asmr?!
Did anyone else expect him to say that’s a bad nipple when he tasted the Halloween mallow thingies? XD
I've missed these review videos, i hope more of them come
The editing on this one was great! I was left smiling from some those jokes for a good few minutes ^-^
Ya ever just. Ya ever just eat a pretzel? ~Mark
Mark is going to end up in the hospital again. 🤦
4:36 That there is Swedish, and it says ”hearty goodness from Gränna”
I COULDNT GET OVER HOW HANDSOME MARK IS THROUGH THIS WHOLE VIDEO
He only rates half of them, I love it
19:06 Whistle got the pup into the room
I missed this kind of video so much
I love the relationship of Lixian and mark it’s so beautiful, you can feel it in the editing
Amy: It's a little too close...... Me: Boy, Mark has nice brown eyes..........
Tyrkisk peber is my favourite type of candy. I prefer to suck on it until it becomes kind of easy to break and then it crumbles. I was never aware of the sugar contents though
mark probably doesn't know how big of an ad he made for lakrids by bulow 🤣
Find it funny that he says jerry can is a funny name for it when literally the whole world calls it that what 😂
Gods this is funny as a Swede
Me staring at the two hairs trapped in Mark’s head band at every close up:  👁️👄👁️
The first was an English candy called a double decker
at the start my mind went to 9/11 fml
Mark better be treating Lixian damn well. I don’t know if there’s many ppl out there with the pure Zero Braincell Power to be on his wavelength like this
28:50 why that look like an album cover tho 😂
LEXIAN IS BACK YESSSS
The candy pinballs are from Germany, the company Maoam (pronounced moe-am) makes really good candy
I am from Norway and recognise tyrkisk peber and knew instantly Mark is not going to like it
Kaycee's mod awaits, mark. Dive back into the world of inscription. Leave this world of sweets and organics to join the cards once more. Leshy is in his cabin.. cards and teeth at the ready. We shall see you there.. in the old data.
Scandinavian family loves to prank others by telling you to exhale through your nose when you chew the Tyrkisk Peber. (Turkish Pepper). The entertaining burn is thanks to ammonium salts in the center. 😁
Day 9 of trying to tell markiplier about the develepment of the epic indie horror game i'm developing"Inner Demons",please markiplier fans,help me reach him by liking this comment,it would mean a lot!
that candy whistle thing is actually kinda cool ngl
How dare you dislike tyrkisk peber it’s literally some of the bast candy (the middle contains something called salmiak it’s just spicy licorice)
Is it just me, or would Markiplier be a really awsome Jack Sparrow?
Not the drinking one
22:24 ngl thought it was coke😂
I love when Mark got to the salmiak that he  reacted that way. Used to work in a candy store with a large licorice assortment and salmiak licorice was something we carried and depending on which one you got it was SALTY   Salmiak is that brown stuff in the licorice and it can even be a kind of powder on candy too. Those white coated sticks he tried are almost like a peppermint candy coated licorice stick  We actually had ones similar to what Mark tried but I don't remember them being that salty...they were almost sweet and salty in flavor, The worst tasting ones we had with salmiak were called "ship ropes" a hard candy that tasted like you were sucking on a salty ship rope from a boat
Man how far you’ve come and watching you grow and grow you make a bad day turn amazing just from one video keep doing what you’re doing thanks for what you do
Did anyone else hear mark say “my grandma is green”?
You should continue the 3 scary games series ngl
The slide whistle worked way better than I was expecting ngl
Was that spencer??
I remember those gum in the Jerry can ones from the 90s.
the sneaky bubbledust mascot looks like one of the stars from dora the explorer
loved mark’s reaction to what my finnish friend calls “sour salmiakki” (the hella salty one) bc when i first tried regular salmiakki i could not handle it
10:18 damn i took that as mark debating whether or not to sniff the candy anyone else
I just got back from watching the distractible where mark explains how he just figured out how to savor his food instead of swallow it whole like some sort of sea bird
I will never understand the fascination with SALT AND LICORICE in Nordic countries.
The licorice root comes from the Glycyrrhiza glabra, initially grown in Southern Europe, Western Asia, and Northern Africa. So, in much warmer climates than Iceland. We have sweet chervil growing wild in Iceland that has an anise flavor. It was imported to Iceland some time ago.
"dont usually consume a lot of ammonium... by choice." - said by the man who drank urine. more than once.
did an alternate take a hold of mark? 😭☠️
23:13 "Ammonium chloride effects on humans ...Conclusion: Intentional ingestions of dilute ammonium chloride solutions can cause serious injury to the gastrointestinal tract and pulmonary systems..."
Salmiak salt (ammonium chloride), which gives it its salty taste, is an antibacterial mucus solvent, and liquorice was also believed to have several medicinal effects back then 👍
Why does Iceland have such a psychosis with licorice and specifically ammonium-chloride, I get the feeling the only things that aren't licorice or salty aren't from iceland, the only thing iceland revolves their lives around is licorice and not just any ordinary salt but ammonium chloride salt for some reason, lmao
nice hehehe
noice
noi e
How does the candle whistle sound like Oliver/Puppycat 😂
I thoroughly enjoyed that video
why was spencer there?? are they dog sitting for eef?
Nostalgia
While he was using the whistle candy I lowley heard screams of the damned in the background😶. Turns out it was from the movie my moms' watching in another room.😂
isnt ammonium chloride toxic to the intestinal tract?
He is LOSING it
Mark you should really play resident evil 4 VR because it’s a really fun game
37:05 ....Is it licorice, Mark?
When I entered your mind, all I saw was lenses…
There’s an actual volcanic eruption happening right now in Iceland 😂
YOU NEED TO PLAY CAPTAIN WILLIE
Not the soft mushroom candy reminding him of a nipple 😭
When is the palworld video
my friend ammonium chloride is more than slightly toxic to ingest
After this video and the amount of Wonka videos on my tiktok fyp the word "Chocolate" has lost all meaning.
“Boop boop beep boo beep”
happy birthday mark!!!
Amy please please please give Mark a pair of baby scissors ✂️ have mercy.
This is literally mark just doing asmr. Asmarkipkier
Plane Air Two towe-
As entertaining as it was to see Mark's hilarious reactions to all this candy, I am rather concerned, esp given his history of health-related problems, with the amount of licorice he consumed in this video. I hope I'm just being overly paranoid.
You happy you got what you wanted to be a good and excellent YouTuber😊
committing to the slide whistle jingle between every following candy killed me
Ammonium chloride, also known as salmiak (from sal ammoniac) is what makes "salty licorice". Us Nordics love it. And the Dutch too, for some reason. It's what was in the middle of the Tyrkisk Peber too (which are Finnish, by the way).
*sits and worries about ur dia-be-tus* 😅
that grunt gave me metal gear flashbacks oh god
Mark: *Stairs off into the camera, acts possessed, talk to mid air*  Amy: Here we go again
Theres a Spencer but no Ethan, what did you do to Ethan? 😐
Off topic here but Mark please play Zoochrosis ❤ it’s a horror game where animals in a zoo are… special!
I missed these review videos soooooooo much
Three words new despicable me movie character eagle hair clubs now new villain so Markiplier what do you have to say
27:00 the crunch lol 😂
you should consider playing guns of Icarus i miss that game
Omg mark learned how to chew!!!!!
MARK AND LIXIAN GIVE ME LIFE!!! 😂😂😂😂
are we not going to talk about amy being in the back???
U have GOT to be kidding me,.. really Mark?!  ❤❤❤❤😅
Markiplier becoming Jack sparrow
Lethal company
2:27 ummm intro? 😂😂 Also, can I use BigDikMoneyBahg as a gamertag 😊
mark, can we cut your hair and clean you up?
8:34 I see what you did there. Labas rytas ir tau.
I thought he was going to say something like “that’s the worst nipple I’ve ever tasted,” but that might not have been great to say with Amy there. 😂  The noise also after he ate the hockey puck sand was so funny. lol
Is that Spencer?
Thanks for coming home, king.
When did Vincent join Markiplier?
the mouth sounds and sound effects in this video were awful!
In history the hair cutters and the ones that got rid of all the "bad blood" were apart of the same store and had a cylinder sign showing a swirl of white and red depicting blood cells must have put that style on mint to sell or give out as samples after getting rid of the bad blood to get rid of the smell coming through the patients nose to avoid throwing up and have a good mouth sensation that calms the patient to get rid of the pain of the experience. Now doctors and dentists give mints to relieve the patient and have something they would look forward too and dentists like to rot your teeth to come back. The mints now also have that style because its colors make it pleasant to the human eye so they kept it the same as before.
I was wondering when this video was going to come out since you mentioned that you were going to make a volcano joke and Amy stopped you on the podcast
I feel like mark uses these vedios as free cheat days 😅
RE4 Mark RE4😢
When he said "But hey..." in that voice my first thought was MatPat. I'm really going to miss him
I can’t explain it but this video feels Charlie Kelley coded
AiR hEaDs aRe SpIcY?!?!?!?!?
pro tip: if all the candy in your life sucks your kids will never want real candy because they think it tastes terrible and its unhealthy but god bless if your kids ever find out you were lying because there will be an uprising
Nice that Mark's gum mentality matches his Takis philosophy.
Ya know. After a really hard day, this is exactly what I needed. Thanks, Mark ❤
Every time my Finnish friends visit we get handed some type of black liquorice adventure. Mainly the Tyrkist  Peber and I have this love hate relationship with it. It tasts so good and so not good at the same time.
I never thought I'd see Markiplier playing a melody pop in 2024
Free ASMR video
So it seems I have another reason to visit Iceland. Licorice is my favorite candy because, in addition to the pleasant flavor, it also for whatever reason, triggers an endorphin response a few minutes after me eating it.
Is it just me or does Markiplier look like snake from metal gear solid
Can you be the next captain jack sparrow. You are the only one I’ll accept 😊
REVIEWS ARE BACK BAYBEEEEEEEE
Mark is giving me Snake vibes lmaooo
WAIT MARK DO YOU THINK THE LAST CANDY IS ICELANDIC OR NOT? I NEED TO KNOW!
Play little nightmares two!!! Please!!
alternative title: mark sees how much he can take: candy edition
Mark turned into donald duck! LMAO
Do Filipino snacks next markkkkk!!!❤
I convinced Mark mistook a mic for candy, and that’s why the *crunch* audio is so high quality.
“Cuz I mean, retention time am I right? Ehheheheheh” *1.2 mil views in one day*
Mark: What country is Swedish candy from? Us: Sweden? Mark: That’s right! Iceland!
Why is Mark dressed like Solid Snake? I'm not complaining. Just curious.
mark, what has happend. It’s been 2 years since the release and update in granny 3, whe will we get granny 3 mark?When?
You should play a game called palworld you can also play with friends
I love the Melody Pop transition sound everytime they give him a new candy 😭
Mark lowkey flexing some of his lens collection.
I wish Markiplier was real
hey markipler i know your not gonna see this but i just wanna say how much i love your content and everything you do i wish i could show you but i dont remeber the other accounts i had ive always have been subbed to you and i think it was 10000 Subscriber Special and from then ive watched every single video from you since then and im very grateful that you make my day better im so happt thru all these years we were able to grow up with each other and im happy your still here
The pulver tasting nearly destroyed me I couldn’t stop laughing for 5 mins lol
Mark is so very much like Jonny Depo in this entire video, and I am saying that as a compliment
hi icelanders
I actually tried an Athletic Brewing Company NA beer last weekend and it was quite enjoyable!
I absolutely love that Lucian put a bell sound for the can
He looks like he's trying the "Jack Sparrow" look😂
Why is Spencer there? o:
People in Iceland have a better chance of seeing Markiplier in public than I do (I live in the Midwest)
Ive had liquid gum (stuff you threw out) and it's as gross as it looked,  but when you're a kid... gums gum.  🤷‍♀️
the fucking whistle gets me every damn time 😭😭
This is so nice. my mom has a friend in iceland and she used to send us a gift basket every year with some icelandic candy.
16:07 Kids when they're told to eat their vegetables.
I found it oddly wholesome when he said "If you don't have exactly 2 nipples, you're special, and I love you"
apparently the gum tube isn’t sealed normally and as someone who thinks about the chicago tylenol case a lot idk how to feel about that
That intro was everything 😭
Tyrkisk pebers ❤❤❤
mark please take care of your nails
I think Sweden hijacked the candy market in Iceland lol
Was this actually the first time Mark didn't have a special surprise at the end in one of his review episodes?
It's is the Swedish flag🇸🇪👏
The melody pop upset my dog 😅
Hey Mark, love your vids! Keep up the good work! But I started to notice how you seem to be losing interest in youtube, but if anything is bothering you in your outside life is bothering you then you can tell us because we will understand!
6:27 is a cat crunching meme, but it's actually Markiplier
I swear with all the youtubers retiring if markiplier retires i will die
Lol I had a whistle pop back in the 80s maybe early 90s. (Im in New England) There was no slide,  but the whistle was loud AF... 'til it melted.  🤷‍♀️  ... but the ones here in the US actually worked... and parents HĀTĘD them! 😄  EDIT: When I say it was loud... think like a coach's whistle and it was ear-splitting.
@19:00 this is where the phrase "wet your whistle" comes into play lol.
39:55 for all u ppl who wanna skip to see chica
32:08 dear markiplier, put one of those paper party streamers in your mouth. let it sit for about 5 seconds. it’ll really make your day awful <3
*pain*
Reviews are back. This is the ideal markiplier.
Man You're just making me hungry
I would love to hear the whistle in different videos 😂
Had a shitty day and Mark  leaning into the camera made me cry until I heard the squeak 😂
I want to know how much money Mark spent on all this candy 😂
**Cronch**
-00000000000000.1 / 10
50 minutes of Markiplier eating candy
Plane air sky… two towers
The Iceland expert is here! Looks like the museum you went to is Árbæjarsafn and the candy store was probably Vínberið.  Denmark is the liquorice country of the world and there were a few Danish candy there: The mint candy, the white chocolate, Tyrkisk Peber, Skolekridt, BÜLOW  I will list all the authentic Icelandic candy for you:  1 - NS Jólaköttur 3 - NS Trítlar 5 - Appolo Stjörnurúlla 12 - NS Eitt Sett (Súper Sett) 13 - NS Opal 15 - Freyja Djöflar 17 - Sambó Þristur 21 - Appolo Lakkrísrör
"I dont... want that in me anymore" - Markiplier 2024
I enjoy Marks review videos so much. Lixian if you ever read these comments, you’re an amazing editor and I laugh so much. Top shelf. The adding of a man yelling whenever something drops, Chef’s kiss.
has mark tattooed his forehead or smt?
😂😂 mark
love how when hes saying the name it just sounds like hes speaking simish ♦
For someone who loves sweets such as candies, I dont like liquorish. For me alcohol and candy are a weird and sometimes bad mix but that's just me. The last time I had liquorish candy it tasted like rubber which was not fun. The only thing that looks familiar from all the candies Mark tasted was the gum jar which I tried back when I was a kid in America and no I'm not from Iceland. Most likely when I go to Iceland I wont try any of their candies considering from the looks of it 90% are liquorish.
Candy whistle, makes me think of toot sweet from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang xD
11:21 Don’t throw out the r word like that, not right now
Missed these videos
Unrelated but does anyone have a link or know where mark got that jacket?
Why does Mark look like he owns a Harley Davidson?
He looks like captain jack sparrow and its amazing lol
Mark: "your special and i love you"  Me: so are you mark
can anyone confirm the from or not from Iceland list
He’s so good at talking to Lixian when he’s not there… maybe he’s schizophrenic.
I can't hear whistles mark 😭
I don’t know why I’m so enthralled watching Mark eat many Icelandic sweets and candies at 2:22am in the morning when I should have been asleep almost an hour ago - but I am
imagine how strange it is seeing mark film an interaction with lixian
Ég elska þig :) that's all I know in Icelandic
I showed my girlfriend your review videos today and her response was "it's Asian Keanu Reeves".
Love it
Who watched the fnaf movie  👇
Awhhh I realized at the end Spencer is having a playdate with Chica and Henry! Or is Ethan lurking around somewhere in the background silently lmao
Other : wow Candy! Me : markiplier never dies Markiplier Always come Back
me legit seeing maoam and screaming at the screen thats germna gsdhgsagdsahjd
Anyone else starting to get captain jack sparrow vibes from Mark?
25 mins into the video I was getting worried for Mark’s health then I saw I was only half way through the video..,
Pinballs were my favorite growing up omg!!!
1. I love The candy whistle sound 🤣💕  2. Seeing mark eat The hard candies makes my teeth turn into dust 🤣🤣  3. Im from sweden and all Nordic countries has an obsession for liquorice (specially salty ones) and I dont understand how people can eat it 🤣🤣
So I’m a little late but chica missing leg?
Only Mark would continue to be surprised by the licorice.
43:34 but hey yolo 😂🤨?
Can someone link me to that jacket Mark is wearing, that thing is so dope
What is the deal with all the licorce? XD
I can see this being Mark’s villain origin story.
My son asked if Markiplier is still alive while watching this video. Valid question.
Markiplier's face is akin to a tragedy mask about 60% of this video
I dont know if anyone else has mentioned this but im pretty sure your not supposed to to eat Ammonium chloride. It just sounds dangerous 😅
Oh my fuckin god. I was just sitting there durring my bday. And my stepdad said "here. Have a whistle pop" and i had never had or heard of one. So i was super excited to play with it. And now to just see it. In the next mark video i watch. Im mind blown
saying "you shouldn't do/say THIS because what if something bad happens" is arbitrary..... Mark is not God... He cant forsee everything happening in the world.... Thats being overly cautious for the sake of random chance too, which is a bit bizarre... Also, bad things happen all the time lol... you saying or not saying anything isnt gonna stop that XD
hol up who's the 3rd dog?? I know Chica, I know Henry, this is the first time I'm seeing the 3rd doggo!
You are too adorable. ❤️❤️
dog is this ur house??? Looks nice bub
skole krit lakris :)
Hi
Things I learned from this video: 1. Volcanoes don't exist 2. There are no cats in Iceland 3. Everything is licorice
Sorry Mark but I have not laughed this much in one of your videos since your try not to laughs😂😂
Screaming falling candy is my favorite Lixian editing gag
candy nr 1. iclandic 2. sweden 3. icelandic 4.  uk 5. icelandic 6. icelandic 7. finland 8.  idk but not icelandic 9. sweden 10. icelanic 11. not icelandic 12. icelanic 13. icelandic 14. made in but not native icelandic 15.  icelandic 16.  not icelandic 17. icelandic 18. im not sure but yes i think its icelandic 19.  finland 20.  denmark i think if i remember correctly 21. icelandic 22. denmark  FYI im an icelandic  person and i have lived here my entire life, if you ever want recomandations for actual icelandic candy you should ask a person who lives there. i hope you had fun in iceland and i feel a little sad that i didnt see you but i hope you come to iceland again.  also super fun seeing you try and try icelandic candy even tho most were not icelandic.  Kveðja, Ylva ^^
"Lixen is amazing" 😊 "You've got this, right Lixen?" 😐
Ammonium Chloride is an odorless, white powder. Solid Ammonium Chloride is used to make dry batteries and Ammonia compounds, as a soldering flux, a pickling agent in Zinc coating and tinning, and a fertilizer. Ammonium Chloride fume, a finely divided particle dispersed in air, is produced in galvanizing operations. fun fact haha
Dude, that Melody Pop candy is like a real life Toot Sweet from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang! 😱
The fucking “spicy” one is making him go through the five stages of grief XD
I love them sm
Im from Iceland and half the things in the not Iceland pile is Icelandic and we do have cats 😂 love you so much mark
0:39 [Cricket sounds have been removed and editor has been sacked], probably.
These are my favorite types of videos mark makes 😂💕 also, 45:48
almost every candy is from Sweden lol and I'm not even from there 😂
Me, who has no nipples : Mark thinks I'm special :3
MARK, HAVING A MOD, NOT YOURSELF, BUT A MOD JUST NOW MAKE A POST ON YOUR DISCORD ABOUT THE GENOCIDE IN PALESTINE IS DISGRACEFUL. SHAME ON YOU. FREE PALESTINE 🇵🇸
Love the new whistle tune thats cool!
The screams at 25:05, 27:28, and 39:12 had me rolling! 😂
drop a workout routine!
Why did I choose to listen with headphones🤣
He reviewed some candy that wasn't from Iceland,  but he also got ripped off as he payed too much for some of the candies.
28:49 Me when no fiber
More like this please i love these 😂❤
🍉
From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free🍉
The slide whistle jingle kills me every time
Im from Iceland!
A FOOD THEORY
I was hoping there would be some Finnish terva candy mixed in the non-Icelandic bunch.  Salmiak is a shock to the tastebuds, terva is too but IMO more pleasant, but salmiak, terva and licorice combined would have blown Mark's face off. The melody pop stole the show though.
the candy at 34:00 is supposed to have a seal at the end of the tube. My guess is that some kid already opened it to have some gum
i appreciate the quality asmr we get in this video lol
Do not retire please dear god I can’t handle more childhood idols retiring MatPat I miss you already but understand rrrrraaaaaAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
its just theroy a food theory hi pup want some of my beer
Yu shuld reallly play cosomology of kyoto
As someone who is from a licorice loving country (Netherlands) we don't blame you for not liking Salmiak. I don't either...
its just a theory A FOOD THEORY
His reviews are my favorite by far. The MRE one is my favorite.
Is it a type of mint?   Edit: I was wrong.
The Hockey Pulver is Swedish and "Socker" means sugar, or socks
You know what i'm willing to bet about the candies with the flames on them? You're probably supposed to suck on them, and it's probably supposed to undergo a reaction as you suck on it that makes it taste much better than if you were to chew it.   Like if you think Mark should try just sucking on the candy instead 👇
Bloody hell it's Jack from the Caribbean
Mark went through the five stages of grief with most of these candies lol
Hey Mark, do you know you can get a secret ending in five nights at Freddy’s help wanted 2 when you find the coin for princess quest
I love the Captain Jack Sparrow vibe Mark is rocking. Maybe this is his era for it…maybe he’ll grow out a beard and have two strands with beads. 😂 who knows. Also…licorice is not my favorite flavor/candy. I wouldn’t last long around my ancestors…I prefer chocolate, Swiss chocolate to be exact. 😂
The u.s used to have that powder gum candy somewhere around the early 2000’s
bro mark 100% sounded like donald duck at 31:41
As someone with a Swedish mother, the salty candy reaction was almost identical to the first time I tried salty candy. I don't know how she eats them by the bag.
2:45 the true face of exhaustion.
Good N Plenty?
Amy is back 😩❤️❤️
WHERE TF IS FNAF?!?!?!?!?!
I think the main reason why Mark might not like many of these is that they might have spoiled by the time he got to eat them 😅
Hey look! *WE* Gave him *Money* to *buy* candy.
"Happy Amy Noises" had me dying😂
As an Aussie that melody pop hits home, it’s best when you give it a few seconds in saliva and then play
Mark's face when he's unsure about the flavours is like a pet trying lemon for the first time
i now really want a belgium candy one. especially our chocolate. i wonder how much better then other places chocolate it is
I remember eating that bubble dust as a kid growing up in New York lol. I'd get it from the ice-cream truck that went around 😆
Anyone else get kind of annoyed at the beginning when it's like "what if there's a disaster about volcanoes?"  Like I feel like there's a point where your tiptoeing a line too hard.
I opened this video with the thought: "you know what, I could use some Mark today." Not disappointed at all!
24:28 it's pronounced mo-am
Imagine if this is someone's first Markiplier video
What is that jacket that he’s wearing? I like the look of it
Play beanboosled next
The items that were very salty and confusing was probably Vegemite
49:19 Wait! I didn't know there's a 3rd dog?!!
the super salt hockey pulver is a childhood candy for me :P
Having you try to what that means😊
iceland has cats hahahahahah
He said face in french 11:00
How is Spencer there? 😆 Also why was he in Iceland?
37:04 It's Menthol crispy coating and Licorice. Or something. Several of the licorice candies are things I have eaten before.  Hockey Puck = Licorice powder.  Ah btw, there is Sweet Licorice and Salt Licorice types. I prefer the sweeter ones.
It's coming from Denmark but not all Candy coming from but i know 😊❤
im from Iceland '
Were are we going captain jack
The raspberry and liquorice is in fact Swedish and it says heartly good from Gränna, gränna is the place where it’s from
I like the part where the power of salt briefly turns you into Adam Driver.
Why do I expect oompa loompas every time the whistle goes off
me eating candy whilst watching a grown man eat candy to feed my dopamine receptors
Can I get a drawing of mark as willy Wonka playing the slide whistle
Fazer IS a Finnish brand named after Karl fazer those pepper ones Are from finland
Can we please talk about Mark's Fingernails? Please clean them before filming a video with zoom at your hands! 😅
That whistle one at around 18:50 hurt my ears!!! 😖
Captain Marksparrow
the slight confusion I felt as a brit seeing maoams was nose exhale inducing
What is up with all the licorice 😂😂
That whistle candy jingle really sounded good though at 20:05
Allot of these weren’t Icelandic, which sucks ;(. If you want to get Icelandic candy look for brands like “nói síríus” “Góa” “Freyja” and “Appolo”. There are a bunch more so u can ask the stores employees for more info. Hope this helps! (Also there are cats in Iceland, and a cat cafe)
Ammonium Chloride is also a drain cleaner! .... and yeah, somehow we have a weird obsession with it here in the nordics. That Hockey Powder has been a thing since at least the 90's. It's the same stuff (basically) as what's inside the Turkish Pepper candies. It's .... Just.... It is what it is. THAT SAID, you can buy turkish pepper liquor, and it's quite nice. In a way.
Mark what do you think of the megan thee stallion and nicki minaj beef 😭🫶🏼
I wonder if Melody Pops will contact Mark to purchase the rights to the jingle he made haha
Licorice is basically ingrained in Icelandic genes bec of embargoes and restrictions. And that salty gunk was for sore throats and freeing up phlegm. also that stuff is not good for you apparently..lol. Your faces had me crying w laughter.
43:40 he said the thing
the salty liqourice is called salmiak, its made with ammonium chloride and it is honestly the worst thing ever idk why the nordic countries like it so much
there was one time I tried that salty licorice but it was from the Netherlands and it’s weird. I actually just hate licorice in general and also when things are way too salty so I should’ve figured 😭
I thought his mind was going to be regret letting Wade win Distractible a few episodes ago.
The whistle beckons.
The powder in the last one was probably black pepper. I love this one candy "kropp" with is similar but a corn puff
episode 2 "markiplier goes to the dentist!!" Lmao
Who (other than me) sat here for 50 minutes watching markiplier eat candy
I wish he would do so many more review videos He is the only person I will watch review stuff
I tried but dont like liquorice
I think there was more uk sweets than Icelandic 😂😂
as an icelandic person it is so strange to see my country get acknowledged in any sort of way. also sad a lot of these weren't even icelandic lol
A lot of these are either not even nordic, they're nordic, they're swedish (because I'm a Swede) or they're legit icelandic 🇮🇸
"there's no such thing as volcanoes."  *exhales sigh of relief Thank God...
lixian is so amazing i cant
Oh Gods, I remember when my Norwegian teacher (in Poland) brought a bag of Tyrkisk Peber for us to try. It's gross 😂 Most of my class spit it out. But for me and my friend it was so bad, it was actually good.
I really like ufo’s but they do really taste like cardboard with weird powder inside
licorice.
So, from a swede, if you can kinda make some sense of it then it's not Icelandic. If it sounds funny and doesn't make sense then it's probably Finnish. If you can kinda make sense of it then it's either Swedish or Norwegian but if it's also kinda funny then it's probably Danish. The trick is when the labels are in english or kinda general bc then you just gotta know where the brand comes from.   As for the raspberry + liquorice it's just a really common flavor combo, lots of liquorice both sweet, spicy, minty and everything. The salty ones are either salty liquorice or, more commonly, salmiak which is ammonium chloride. That's where the taste comes from. I personally love both liquorice and salmiak, I love it salty and a punch of flavor. Don't like sweet liquorice all that much, it's fine. Lots of people in the north here don't like either but they're also wrong.  Edit: oh goodness if mark thinks that's the saltiest candy out there he should try svenskjävlar. They're very tasty, I have half a pack left.
That risa bpristor thing uses a thorn which is pronounced th. So it's thristur
🌟 FLAVOR CHEMICALS 🌟
The whole time I’m watching it I’m imagining some horrible cross between mark and solid snake:  “Hellooooo Colonel it’s me Solid Mark”
Yummy nice
Just came from watching Mark try Korean candy so this video is perfect
It’s so nice seeing Mark and Amy making a video again I hopes they do more reviews
Leave it to Markiplier to make watching someone review candy he's never had before entertaining.  You've got to love Lixian's sense of humor.
37:05 I bet it’s licorice again
I love Mark, I feel like he looks like a pirate
In America u need to say how mamy calories things got? New information to me
i diedd at the chocolate ball screaming
I've never been that prideful about being Icelandic but some how this video hurts anyway
20:40 - I don't know if they originate in England, but those foam "nipples" (mushrooms!) are popular over here - though usually they're just pink and white!
Hey marky you look like my dad.
20:41 personal  bookmark
You know bro, I think you might like high on life, kinda want to see you play it. I believe that it's going to be a great game for you. Plus it sorta matches your vibe.
as someone with three nipples, i love you too
''Solid Ammonium Chloride is used to make dry batteries and Ammonia compounds, as a soldering flux, a pickling agent in Zinc coating and tinning, and a fertilizer.''
The red one is the blood of the children who dont make it past 6 😂
Ah, watching Americans attempt to eat salmiak candy and recoiling in disgust puts a smile on my European face. Skill issue.
You said "enter my mind" and i just thought. FNAF FNAF FNAF FNAF
mark bob and wade gotta play palworld fr
Stop lixian from overtaking the video
do americans not know what hard candies are...
43:30  Best part of the entire video😭😭
That candy jingle kills me literally everytime💀💀💀
The sound of the whistle reminded of me of Zelda Twilight Princess when you're learning a tune 😂
I am always baffled by americans calling the netherlands nordic but then again we also fucking love licorice. Also mark and amy's response to salmiak was absolutely correct but I love getting punched in the face with flavor so I do like salmiak.
2:40 min in and I'm not sure if the whole video is gonna be just different intros
Salmiak is a very salty chemical 😂 im from Denmark and i love it❤
As a Swede I love seeing Americans reaction to eating our salmiak candy
The whistle made me explode 😂
Lots of these are very similar to traditional Dutch candy (and yes, a lot of it includes liquorish.) But I guess it's saltier then American liquorish? Also tend to be less of 100% sugarbombs overall. Some of these I really can't imagine tasting THAT bad to be honest haha.
It’s so funny to watch him eat some Swedish candy that I hate 😂😂
Plain Air Sky Volcanos Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. . .
There’s nothing that tingles my inner Scandinavian as watching Americans taste our licorice
0:20 Amy really jinxed it 💀
Ramboplier
So many of these candies are swedish :0
Hey its that one video that mark talked about on distractable a few weeks ago
"D19F54A9" Just incase you forgot
That liquid gum looks like the ooze from Ghostbusters 2 o_o
The best videos
Yessss
I love it when Mark makes this type of content
DO NOT RETIRE!!!!! NOOOOOOO
I used to find liquorice straws like that but the inside had powdered sugar, so you would suck out the sugar like a sherbet straw then use it as an actual straw, I only ever found black and red but I think there were other colours They all mostly tasted like liquorice but the red one was hands down the best, it was subtle instead of punch your face like goku liquorice flavour I havent found them in a good 8ish years, I miss them ANYWAY cool video Thats what I was meant to say but then I remembered the straws when he boinked the beer with the thingy thing
I’ve been seeing those little Frisia saucer candies lmaoo
as someone who had top surgery with no fng's, 21:45 genuinely made me tear up /pos
Died laughing at the tyrkisk peber parts! :D for the record Fazer is Finnish so you made the right call
Mark's facial expressions are so memeable lol
The ”nippels” 😅 are mushrooms
GENUINE QUESTION: Are Mark and Amy a thing or are they just buddies.  I assumed they were friends way bsck discovering them during Unnus Annus, but someone said they were together recently and now i have no idea snd have no sources lol
You woke up my cat with the candy whistle. She is very upset.
Oh, hi mark
Hi Mark! I was the receptionist in Iceland that got you candy at 3 AM! Hope you had a lovely stay!
I miss Bubble Butt, I wonder how that little guy is doing.
This has become the licorice video.
sobs markiplier was in iceland and i missed it, im so sad
Ok 👌 cool 😂
I'm so glad we're returning to this style of video 😭😭😭
I recognize that brand of powdered gum, it's Mexican... or at least it's sold at every Mexican Cany store I've ever been to
villikottur is from iceland and trítlar,the licorich  roll,the super sett,opal,djoflar,risa thristur,the straw,
20:40
I actually like licorice, but I've never tasted it paired with anything.
I love watching Mark struggle through One tyrkisk peber when its a Treat we enjoy in Finland. Someone tell him that some people even soak them in vodka or hard liquor, it makes a neat drink
"Spit OOZING out of the front of this uuhhrr I don't know about that one guys 😬"  No one remind him of spit valves.
can u please play the scary hard game to beat called "polaroid" its on "rec room" VR
Should get a bunch of candy from around the world and try and guess the country its from
I dunno why but something about these videos where Markiplier just sits in-front of a camera taste-testing different stuff just hits different and I really love 'em. Hope more of these continue to come out alongside the usual content! Love ya Mark.
I absolutely love the sound design in this video  the little transitions and yelling candy make me cackle.
For Tyrkisk Peber, put the whole bag in a bottle of vodka and let them dissolve completely over a week or three. Then use it for straight up shots. That's how we do.
Tyrkisk Peber is Finnish. I used to have them a lot as an expat in Finland from US. The stuff in the center is ammonium chloride, and it tastes salty. I liked them.
"You could grind salt into your palm, and lick it straight. A thing I do regularly."  - Mark "not a masochist" Fischbach
I am Icelandic and I love this video it’s too funny watching him try this candy😂
"Plane, air, sky.."  "Towers"
37:10 its good and plenty!!!
The title of the video should be "I review licorice candy", i missed these videos.
I went to Iceland about 1 1/2 years ago. It was a good time. Didn’t get a lot of Icelandic candy.
“why is he dressed like if Jack Sparrow had access to modern clothing?” - my sister
the little jingle got me cackling every single time
Markiplier you’re an amazing person and I love your videos I’ve been subscribed since you were in college and your videos no matter what make me happy because you express your real emotions and your real opinions about whatever you come up with don’t work yourself too hard and we all love you much support👍👍👍
Scandinavian licorice is always at least a little salty and it’s amazing
Im speacial and mark loves me and i wont elaborate
good content watching markipliers mouth up close
You should review Turkish candy they are delicious :D
2 days from now, video from the hospital due to licorice OD.
"open up for me" 💀
Mark had the same joy experimenting with the melody pop whistle as I did as a kid; priceless.
My partner is icelandic I’m gonna get her to check the authenticity 😂
Melody pops were every slavic child's childhood
Man I missed this shit so much 👍🤣🤣🤣
What is Spencer doing here?
Mark making jokes about retention time like I didn’t watch him play a glorified cookie clicker for hours on end
You should try traditional Scottish tablet/sweets
We entered markiplier's mind before gta vi 😮
Tyrkisk Peber is a Scandinavian classic. I'm 40 in Norway and know it from my childhood - and my generation also got to drinking age with "peber shots", which is a bag of Tyrkisk Peber shoved into a bottle of vodka and left to marinate.
Mark becomes an angry pirate when he eats gross candy. Good to know. That's another movie idea!
I never thought I'd see markiplier try a melody pop, i thought they were only in the uk
mark reviewing candies are probably his best videos
48:00  mark:  nononono  Me :"doggos!"
Mark quoting matpat is always good
"....peber...." -Markiplier 2024
The raspberry and licorice sounds so good o:
As a guy with two pairs of nipples I appreciate that Mark 😂
“I don’t want that in me anymore,,😢” is the highlight of giggles today while I’m sick, god that was so unexpected I nearly choked
Cut your nails bro
I need the "new candy" whistle tune for my message alerts 😅
As someone from the UK, that sneaky dust stuff is not from the Uk, never seen it, never heard of it.
Markiplier my friend's say I look like you i don't know why
19:06 if you watch in the back, one of the dogs walked into the doorway to see what the heck that sound was😂
wait am i losing my mind or is that a third dog??? who is this mystery third dog???
Play 98xx pleassssssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!
the way mark opens the bags gives me anxiety😭
Food theory suein 😂
"They dont have american food safety standards" yeah why would we make it less safe than we have it now?
He slowly but surely looks more and more like capitan jack sparrow. Love the headband
"Do you know what this is?" *fully expects him to say "It's GARBAGE"*
WHY IS IT ALL LICORICE😭😭😭
"your special......... and i love you (strange melody)
They really like their Licorice huh?
Oh boy the intro was gonna be a 9/11 joke
Markiplier: I want you to enter my mind   {enters his mind} hello?..... HELLO -ELLO-ello-lo-lo...... Wow, it's so empty in here..... ECHO-echo-cho-o....
the melody pop sounds like those mlp infection aus
yeas Mark wasting food is indeed bad, even candy
Almost all of "salt" liquorish contains some form of ammoniac to make it more liqour ish ish. At least in Scandinavia.
Half of these aren't authentically Icelandic
The funniest part for me is him playing that damned whistle candy 🤣
Why do you kind of remind me of John Wick
He’s giving captain jack sparrow 😂 with the headband
As a Finn, seeing him eat Turkinpippuri was fun :D
You should try mexican candy  :D
ITS JUST A THEORY, A FOOD THEORY!!!!
You should review American candy
15:10
That little yell when the ball fell really gave me a chuckle
Why does he look like Jack Sparrow??
Please play fears to fathom ironbark
turkish pepper is FINNISH
Yoooo the review series i love this series i hope more comes out for this series
Welp…Mark has his new theme song. 🎵 Doo-oo doot doot DOOT! 🎶 😂💕
We have way more candy than just licorice!
takeaway lesson: Icelanders like salty stuff and licorice, got it.  because my doc told me to stay away from salty foods, and i HATE LICORICE >n<
i love you and your videos markiplier. i love this video because you eat candy i grew up with.
36% of all that was Icelandic. Yes I actually did the math.... Jólaköttur Trítlar Stjörnu rúlla Súper sett Opal Djöflar  Þristur Apalo lakkrísrör
"This camera does not get enough love"- Markiplier 2024
Sooo, Icelandic candy is hundreds of different ways of eating licorice and the saltiest salt? Got it! 👍
the dog coming to check out the whistle
MArk please Gränna is a small town in sweden outside of Jönnköping LMAO
Finally a new food review thanks
41:19 was that Spenser with Chika and Henry?
Short and quick and retention time for an almost hour long video 😂😂
MARK STOP MAKING MATPAT REFRENCES I WILL CRY
Aussie lollies next? PS: make it a thing where in each lollie video you have that whistle in between each product and also please include your dogs more in your videos their soooooooo cute maybe like a dog cam or something
Currently watching this as I work on swapping a gen4 LS engine into my 350z.   You're the reason I'm laughing while I do this instead of yelling explicatives and throwing wrenches across the garage.  Thank you for being awesome  <3
Mark: reads back of gum that states it’s made in the uk Also mark: ahh yes must be Icelandic sweet
Þ is a thorn.  You pronounce it as a th sound merk
Yes, that candy had the swedish flag and came from a factory in a town called Gränna outside jönköping in småland
so much likerish
i think the ones with the flames is wasabi
1st = icelandic 2nd = swedish 3rd = icelandic 4th = UK?? 5th = icelandic 6th = ??? 7th = not icelandic 8th = not icelandic 9th = swedish 10th = probably not icelandic? 11th = not icelandic 12th = icelandic 13th = icelandic? 14th = not icelandic 15th = icelandic 16th = not icelandic 17th = icelandic 18th = not icelandic 19th = not icelandic 20th = not icelandic 21st = icelandic 22nd = not sure??
but you didnt say if you were wrong about them being from iceland or not
Mark, have you ever thought about doing a John Wick prequel? No reason......
Mark.. I think one of those "candys" where dog treats
I love mark quoted matpats “its just a theory, a food theory!”
Iceland was probably one of the most incredible places I’ve ever been to.. but if I saw THE markiplier there I’d lose it
37:08 CALLED IT
Video: transitions Audio: 🐦🎵🎶🎶🎵
48:04 there were a lot of unexpected things in this video but by far the most unexpected thing was Spencer just spawning in the background
EVERY THING IS LICORICE
searched up Ammonium Chloride and found this: Ammonium Chloride is an odorless, white powder. Solid Ammonium Chloride is used to make dry batteries and Ammonia compounds, as a soldering flux, a pickling agent in Zinc coating and tinning, and a fertilizer.  this sould not be in candy
Candy’s from Iceland 🇮🇸  Candy number 1- Jólakötturinn Candy number 3- Trítlar Candy number 5- Stjörnulakkrís Candy number 12- Súper Sett Candy number 13- Opal Candy number 15- Djöflar Candy number 17- Risa Þristur Candy number 21- Lakkrísrör Out of these 8 he got 6 right. Thank you for giving the Icelandic candy’s a try and greetings from Iceland 🇮🇸
i saw spencer :D
"We're tasting Icelandic candy!" *second candy brought out is Swedish **-with-** a Swedish flag on it*  There's quite a lot of Swedish candy you have there! ,p
Mark this is really important I went to Iceland this past summer and I need to know if you want to the really cool Icelandic punk museum or the equally cool phallological museum (both in Reykjavik)
Listeners of didtractable know about the volcano
Last one is Danish.. Bülow is legit stuff tho, premium candy..
and btw that scream when the chocolate falls is pure gold
44:00 Mark: *Sips* And he died later that day...
34:06 its actually supposed to sealed😨 so there was probably some random kid out there who took that seal off and took a bite, im happy you didn't try the gum 😂
Where's a pair of tactical scissors for Mark when he needs it?
that "maoam" candy sounds like the moam from germany
I can't stand try candy videos But I'll still like and comment on this because its mark❤❤❤
He didn't say "bye bye". I feel incomplete.
"Does Iceland have cats?" - A wise man named Markiplier.
Has... has Mark never seen bubblegum dust before? This was really common when I was a kid.
37:05 let me guess, licorice 😐
do ireland or poland please
The lollipop whistle is something i tried in my childhood (I’m greek)
MARKIPLIER ÍSLANDS VINUR?!
Wait ur part Korea!?
Wait ur part Korea!?
Wait ur part Korea!?
For the love of god chew with your mouth closed, Mark. Lol.
Wait ur part Korea!?
Wait ur part Korea!?
What we can take away from this video: mark is not a fan of Salmiak
Wait ur past Korea!?
two minutes and thirty five seconds in and it feels like I've been watching this video for an hour already.
love when Mark try to pronouncing the names
The bubblegum in a tube is safe!! It just looks like that :3 Used to absolutely love it as a kid
Maoam is German! a childhood favorite c:
this is the only time i am proud to say, i do not have exactly TWO nipples
Candy: “made from UK”  Mark: “clearly this is from iceland
This is a very random question, but can you make a video where you play TF2?
My Finnish ass cackling at Mark eating a turkinpippuri :DDDD
The quality of the video is exeptional, i mean he always has good quality in his videos but i can feel there's a lot of improvement and maybe one or multiple different lenses (true ones know) in his arsenal now
Too bad Mark didn't try the bubble gum tube. But definitely dodged the bullet. Not great texture and flavour last like two seconds.  Also isn't Spencer Ethan pet?
ICELAND HAD VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS THAT DAY ILLUMINATI BRO
Mark just crossed Airheads and Warheads…
21:40 Mark: anyone who doesn't have exactly 2 nipples... Me: *sitting here with no nipples* 👀
“It’s very sweet, probably the sweetest out of all of these. It’s not that sweet, it’s pretty salty.” There’s the type of review I’ve come to expect from Mark.
22:56 it's for lollipops, you can also get a licorish one
Jólaköttur means christmas cat, and its as Icelandic as I am!! (Icelander here)  Second one is literally swedish with a swedish flag Bruh
You should try Norwegian candy, especially some of the chocolate :)
its funny he thinks there's no cats in the country of the Jólakötturinn
Talk about Palestine, your silence is deafening
Mark’s impression of MatPat is very accurate. All hail the Lore God
I am telling Alex!
Salmiak is the bane of my existence.  My mom brought a box back from a past trip to Finland and it was the last I ever ate of licorice.  I drink pickle juice and love salt but Scandinavian salmiaks are 🤢
wait americans have food safety standards ...
“I think we’re just out of practice” you guys made a whole movie 😭😭
Food safety standards in the US are worse actually aua  There's tons of bad shit that's banned in Europe yet we have it in our processed food over here
Markiplier: "Ok now just INCEPTION yourself, WAHOOP"
Wait if Spencer is there? Wheres Ethan?
I might try icelandic candy for my next video food video🤔😆
the shop, iceland?
He's burned too many corporate bridges and is now reaching to Iceland, of all places, to sponsor him.
I've got a few questions for Mr. Mark-E-Piler 1 when did you go to Iceland? 2 why did you go to Iceland? business? or personal? 3 where are you in this video?  I don't recognize it 😅 I am well aware these questions will very likely never be answered 😒
You gotta do Dansih candy. PS: Tyrkisk Peber is dansih :))
35:30 THAT LETTER WAS A THORN!! RANDOM KNOWLEDGE I HAVE NO REASON FOR KNOWING!! THAT P-B LOOKING THING IS A THORN THAT MAKES THE "TH" SOUND :D
11:20  you. can.  w h a t.     don't joke like that kind sir.
WE LOAEV THE COMAOSBTEY EGEEGEEGEGEGE EAGH EAGH EAGH ALALALLALALALA HRA HRA HRAGHRSBZTFGXH VJNMLÖ
what was he trying to play with that wistle candy?
Not a nippel it’s a mushroom 🤣
Mark has gross nails
18:8 these are so good my mom used to always buy these 🥹
This video made me realize that if I lived in Iceland I would be much healthier because I DON’T like licorice
i love how he calls the one candy with a swedish flag on it icelandic 😭
I missed these review videos.
Mark reading the names of the candies sounds very strongly like Simlish He's a sim We're all sims
“I’m not going to change who I am for this candy” is one of the funniest things I’ve ever heard. I don’t know why, but that just tickled me.
bro how does mark have 36 million subs. 1 million people view this video. but theres only 95 thousand likes?!
I thought it was going somewhere else with my grandma…
It is ALWAYS a delight when someone tries salmiakk candy for the first time. I love it but I like salty licorice and grew up on salmiakk lol, so fair on his reaction
licorice in sweden, finland, norway, iceland, denmark,  its all the same and i don't understand how people can eat somthing that is all salt outside and inside of the candy.  Rarely you find a good licorice but moste of the time its just all salt swedish people thinks it is normal to 40% salt.
why is there swedish and finnish candy in there
The candy jingle has me dying
Can you try swedish candy next? Plz😮
"like airheads they oversell the spice" what do you even mean by this
finally!! i have been waiting for this video since he mentioned it in distractable 😂
Where have I been, who is dog #3. I recognize Chica and Henry but I need to know frand.
Next Up: Markiplier Reviews Long John Silver's
Wait why was Mark in Iceland?
Charismatic controlled chaos. The intro is perfect just the way it is.
👹Licorice👹
enjoyed listening to you while studying, thank u Mark. but I hope you would try some sour middle eastern snacks. they won't disappoint you. anyways thank u for todays enjoyment.
hey markiplier! just to let you know the whole visage game has came out and i would love to see you play it again! there is alot of new chapters too!
Omg that's slide whistle... My music teacher uses to give them as prizes. Its been decades since I've even thought about them. Live in USA, so take that info for what it is.
Every Time I Hear That Whistle I Lose More And More Sanity
This is one of my favorite Markiplier videos now
i missed these videos
Dude, try Swedish fika snacks. Dammsugare is the best thing ever. It's named after vacuums because they think it looks like an old fashioned vacuum cleaner.
Markiplier: Master of Indecision
As a Swedish and Danish person, I am offended by your opinions on the candy from Gränna and Turkisk Peber. It's delicious, I won't accept any other answer
1:54 lol
Mark, you managed to stretch out a 10 minute review of candy to 49 minutes or so. Congrats on getting people to watch it that long.
ICELAND MARKIMOOO
"Hjärtligt gott från Gränna" is actually Swedish, so that's a Swedish made candy, not an authentic Icelandic one.
~19:00 you made my puppy lose his mind looking for the whistle lol
Wait, i haven't been following social media WHAT'S WRONG WITH CHICA'S LEGS?!
The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues.
the first one is a "christmas cat" which is an old story of a big blood thirsty cat that would kill people that didn't have new clothes on by christmas lol
11:22  Don't you dare say the word 'retire'
Just watching this 22 hours after post and when after my girlfriend dumped me, just scrolling and binging Markiplier vids to make me feel better.  ❤️💔😭
I loved melody pops as a child. Lixian using it as a funny bit in your video is pure gold
Thank u mark for supporting Israel
was eating while watching and we was in sinc
This is just another form of ASMR
that was the swedish flag
28:35 As a final review, since i've commented way too many times, is that these nordic individuals were having a laugh! Yeah, there is a lot of licorice, BUT marabou and fazer chocolate are some of the best chocolates in the world, besides, maybe, lidt. And they have gummy candy without the foam bottom, and that aren't hard -> soft gummies. You should probably ask someone who likes you next time! but this was amazing as a react video, i am laughing so hard. I just showed this to my mom, and she laughed with me as well, even though she grew up with the licorice candy as her favourite. The best licorice to buy is the one that is like a sandwich, with pink and white and yellow squares. It is a mix pack, but since i don't like licorice, that is my suggestion XD they also have these licorice tubes with a pink, yellow, or white filling, which is sweet, and makes up for all of this you just went through.
I am trapped in your mind forever
Mark I think you should play fear and hunger
That shape is called a humbug
You know wat i mean richt
Here for the happy Amy noises!
Markiplier looks like a Deadpool variant.
In Finland we call the grey/white candy coated liquorice "chalk" since it looks like a school chalkboard chalk
this video has more views than the population of iceland, in one day
Markiplier please play it🥺
you should do a video where you try uk candy
Play it please 🥺
Tangent, but: Anyone recognize that really interesting wifi microphone Mark has on the table there? Just haven't seen that model before, looks neat and clearly picked up more than you'd expect without needing a boom.
1/30/2024
In 2 days Poppy playtime shapter 3
EVERYONE WE MUST NOT LET MARKIPLIER RETIRE OK
Got the candy in Hungary as well: 1., 2., 3.,  6., 11., 14., 15., 17., 20. Do not have it: 4., 5., 7., 8., 9., 10., 12., 13., 16., 18., 19., 21., 22. They might have different names, hace different taste or were made by different companies, but it's basically the same candy :D
So pretty much iceland is just a land of licorice is what youre sayin. Thats absolutely gross. Lol
Play Void Crew with Bob and Wade
Finally one of my favorite people in my favorite place in the world. God has blessed us🇮🇸‼️🇮🇸‼️🇮🇸‼️🇮🇸‼️🇮🇸‼️🇮🇸‼️🇮🇸‼️
Please continue to use that jingle. Pure magic. 😅
Why's there so many Gränna (sweden) candies in your Iceland box
First review video where we don't get a secret bonus item?
31:55 Salmiak is a very distinctive salted liquorice.... from Finland
Get this man a scissors.
Markiplier or lixian if youre hearing this, please bring back the minecraft series
Mark chewing gum until the flavor is gone (usually 2 minutes) is mildly painful 😅 Going off of Scott Cramer's YouTube video on gum, Trident is the longest lasting of flavor - around 8 minutes. I haven't tried it myself yet, but that's promising!
As soon as Lixian placed that slide whistle transition music I lost it😂😂😂
Ammonium chloride/salmiakki: the saltier salt
Mark please do something with your nails 🫣
Day idek of asking mark to play the new garten of banban
Danish person jumping in for a bit of commentary, to maybe explain some of the things for Mark and the audience  4:15 Mark: *puts candy with the MOST Icelandic name in the "Not from Iceland" pile* Fun fact, there's a whole Icelandic myth about a Yule cat, a giant cat creature which comes to eat people who do not get new clothes for Christmas. And cats were most likely brought over to Iceland by the first viking settlers as cats were often used on ships for pest control, plus cats had important meaning in Norse Mythology as Freya had two big ones pulling her carriage. So cats are definitely in Iceland.  5:56 Correct. That *is* the Swedish flag. The Icelandic flag is blue with a white-bordered red cross.  17:08 The high amount of sugar in it is because it's hard candy, it's literally just sugar turned into syrup at high temperatures and then cooled down. All hard candies have that much sugar in it.  Also anything with the word salmiak or saltlakrids or any iteration of those words means it's liquorice with ammonium chloride in it, which is probably what you taste as "chemical". It's very popular here in the Nordics, we often put it inside hard candies with liquorice or tart flavours and it's definitely an acquired taste - I personally love it (surprise I'm Danish aka Nordic), can't get enough of it, but I understand if people are not fond of it. And I can't help but feel a sadistic glee when watching people try it out the first time XD  What you think of as regular liquorice is often called sweet liquorice here to distinguish it from salty licorice.  20:20 THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE MUSHROOMS OK?! XD-  23:00 Socker just means "sugar" in Swedish and pulver means "powder" in Scandinavian languages.   31:29 Oh Mark, that's... that's not a cat. Djöflur means "devils" in Icelandic. The hell you were in for, oh god.  36:42 Ah Skolekridt, those are a stable of Danish candy (although made by the Finnish brand Fazer). The name means "school chalk"  45:54 Nope, Lakrids by Bülow is a Danish brand making gourmet liquorice, often in combination with chocolate. Personally I'm not a fan of the combination of chocolate and liquorice, and I find Lakrids by Bülow very overpriced, but if you are not the biggest fan of liquorice, there's high chance you will like that better than a lot of cheaper brands so it makes sense that you are a fan of that one.
I work in food manufacturing for dessert items, I think that "hot" flavor that Mark obviously didn't like was Capsicum extract. It tends not to be very hot in candy processing and doesn't taste very good.
im glad he could mark my pliers again, i don't think i could live without my pliers marked.
😂Ayo This Video Had Me Dying With Laughter!!!😂
all the Finnish people offended about Mark almost put turkish pepper on wrong side xD
23:05 Socker= sugar, lakrits= Licorice, and the other thing... is probably to keep it fresh. Unsurprisingly... not going to be great. Pulver= powder, if anyone wants to know, probably supposed to be the inside of a hockey puck.
As an Australian as soon as you got the whistle lollie out I was so excited. Literally my favourite lollie from my childhood
The 'nipple' candy looks about the same texture as Circus Peanuts, except maybe it's licorice flavored rather than banana
Lakritze
I was SO ready for “my grandma… is dead” (very grateful that wasn’t his default 😂)
Liquorice
jolakottur is icelandic, and it has a cat on it because the name of the candy means "yule cat" in icelandic, which is a myth in iceland (ps: the flag on the second candy was in fact the swedish flag)
i lov the wistle
I need that candy jingle as my phone's notification tone NOW  Also hoping to see a mexican candy review someday, wouldn't that be funny.
Wait, chica has no legs?
There is actually a eruption going on in Iceland in my home town called grindavík if   You didn’t know. and I was born there and now I live in Reykjavík until I move again sadly😢
Lixian carries?
Swedish flag and text on the bag  "This is probably authentic" :D
Djöflar har so good! I love those! But I totally get why people don't like them because they are so harsh XD Also I'm Swedish so yeah it explains things.
L I C O R I C E
markiplier please play ironbark lookout it is the fourth episode of fears to fathom and is really good and scary
13:55 You need to try the Fazer version of this! It is soooo good to suck on, Or bite in to! It is simply up to whether or not you like melted chocolate or not. I'm more versed in Swedish and Finnish chocolate than Icelandic. but I can verify that nothing is as sweet as ANYTHING from America, even down to the pizza. And I'm not a fan of licorice, but it is everywhere! I think it is because the root it comes from, is most likely able to survive the climate... they even use it in salads! It's called Fenkål in swedish...
Had to make a second comment after I got further in - I’m of Dutch descent and yes, Germanic countries are OBSESSED with having the most ungodly, saltiest licorice that has ever been known to man. It is way too common 😂 Gotta say it’s wildly validating to see Mark and Amy in near physical pain over eating these dkdkdk I was the only one out of my family who hated the salty licorice, meanwhile everyone else couldn’t get enough  And it really is saltier than salt, idk how they do it
Markiplier I watch you
Lixian adding Mark's whistle candy jingle to everything after that was pure gold.
The way he imagined a plane immidiately triggerd my fight or flight response regarding a certain event
marketbplayer going to die from bear :*(
I swear nobody ever likes Djöflar,  i know growing up with em makes me biased but they’re so awesome
I can't believe he talked shit about Tyrkisk Peber. As a Danish person, I'm insulted.
When I’m on a airplane do I ask for cola and meal please no bread ?
I love the whistle between each candy
I like how half of it is Norwegian💀
i had the second one as a child, a lot and i loved it
parkitryer pls ple raldis crackhoos, raldi is best in gaem, mrnbeast funny squidg ame
Basically the whole video is just Mark suffering for 40 mins, so it's a good video
Markiplier became off brand johnny depp, lmao
Never imagined mark woupd visit iceladn
Wait what happened to Chica's legs?
Holy crap, never knew how good Mark would look in 4k
I am Icelandic from Iceland, and it's really cool cuz I am related to a king there
I am from Iceland and I and everybody I know like tyrkish Peber because I have eaten tyrkish peber ICE CREAM (it was good)
All the candies I know as being Swedish -The second candy -The "Nipples" -The hockey powder
spenser!?
Just glad we only went three layers into Mark’s mind because after that is Limbo.
I’ve had those flute lollipop things as a child growing up…. And I’m Australian XD
Dude, the sour UFO discs were such a huge thing back when I was a kid, I used to eat those like crazy
There is a lot of licorice in Iceland
Try some persian candies
jólaköttur is a cat that eats cildren if the don,t get clotheng for christmas
scandanavia's salt candy is a crime against humanity
31:38 i will take this reaction to my grave. This was absolutely priceless, and Lixian, thank you for using the whistle on the transitions, that was actually hauntingly beautiful and I really liked that.
Nice.
Extremely common Europe L
ICELAND MENTIONED 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
From Google:  "Ammonium Chloride is an odorless, white powder. Solid Ammonium Chloride is used to make dry batteries and Ammonia compounds, as a soldering flux, a pickling agent in Zinc coating and tinning, and a fertilizer. Ammonium Chloride fume, a finely divided particle dispersed in air, is produced in galvanizing operations."
You should do this, but for South African candies/sweets. I promise we're safe down here...
26:59 face of instant regret
most of these were swedish lol
I mean the strew suppose to soak in the drink
I love how lixian takes marks funny nonsense and makes it amazing
Is it liquorice? Yes
Misophonia makes me absolutely hate hearing people eat, especially with wet smacking noises. Yet here I am, listening to Markimoo eat various different candy.
Most of the candies are actually Swedish!
Why does mark give off jack sparrow vibes with his outfit •_•
We need more food reviews
When i saw pinballs apear it made me want to go get a pack. Easily my favourate candy to date.
i love the amount of random camera angles, it makes the video so much better
Love the jingle in between😂
Mark your facial expressions are hilarious in this video XD I just kept on seeing an ahjussi each time 🤣
Why does he look like a modern Captain Jack Sparrow ? Am I the only one who noticed that ? Lol
the way mark was in iceland, my home country, where i live, WHERE NO FAMOUS PEOPLE OR ANYBODY I LIKE GOES, and i had no idea just makes my head explode 😭 if he was in reykjavík especially i’m gonna lose my mind wtf
This is so unrelated to the video but Chica is such a sweet ole girl 🥹 I got my cat around the same time Mark for Chica and seeing her made me realize how long it’s been 💕💕💕
Shout out for Mark to try Colombian candy
Entering Markipliers endless thoughts for 4 hours:  [The YouTube Video]
F ton.. Liquorice.. Ig he love it!
the way every time i cheered before a candy because it was one of my favourites he cringed and then told me how disgusting it was LMAO
Mark, you gotta proposal to that girl it’s been almost 10 years
my ears suffered immense trauma this episode, thank you Mark ;-;
watching mark discover the chupa chupa whistle is so great lol
Mark casually throwing Dutch in with the Nordic countries. American geography at its finest. :')
19:05  Dog in the back: You called?
was that spencer??
Mark. Mark. I'll warn you even tho this has 0 chance of making an impact. You will push your hairline way back sooner wearing a bandana like that every day.
I mean mint candy is always white and red.. I mean.. Christmas candy cane?
I guess Marikiplier does not like Salmiakk, but as an Icelander this video is great! Im so sorry Mark for your pain :P we do like our lakkris here :P  Usuly we drink coca cola with the lakkrisror :P
Love this entire moment 43:32
My partner’s mom is Swedish, and I’ve had most of these thanks to her! Can vouch for the “spicy” liquorice and the salt hockey puck powder, it’s definitely an acquired taste 😂
i’m fully icelandic and i really don’t like most of the things he just tried :’3 and with how he pronounces the names is too funny every time-
the fyrisk pebber thingy isnt from iceland i think bc in denmark i found the same thing but written in danish
there's no such thing as volcanos, ther're earth pimples
Maoam look like our Polish candy! I seen lot different maoam candy, but even Idk if is Polish really 🤔
Mark lookin like Jack Sparrow 2.0 Tbh it works
lol I just reversed this curse myself, I’m so sorry you’re going through this Mark. Everything turning to licorice in your mouth isn’t the worst curse ever though, it could have been salt…  HMU when you’re ready to reverse it, but I gotta warn you; you’re gonna have to find a goat and probably a handful of tarps unless you’re planning on painting your room red.
nice video mark keep up the good work
try batang kali 👍
Our Polish whistle candies are better! Also ours are see through shows quality lol then his a musician X3
Just realised mark is going full jack Sparrow in the Locker vibes
1:00 Again???  I’ve already been trapped once in Darkiplier/Damien/Celine’s mind for eternity!!!
PLAY KINITO PET
Mark du gjorde det väldigt bra 👀
I realize this is in the comment section of a Markiplier video but his viewers are often younger and seeing Iceland may motivate someone to go so I want to warn anyone who is naive like me about life in Iceland.   Be very careful- it isn't the utopia that tourism makes it out to be. I didn't go there as a tourist, I once had plans to live there. A lot of their equal rights talk is just lip service. Women can have a tough time and the laws aren't always fair. There's a lot of mail order brides there who become entrapped by their husbands. Lots of corruption.   Keep to yourself if you're naive, no matter what you look like. SA can happen to anyone. It's often about power and hurting a person.   It's wise NOT to drink or stay out on Saturday and Sunday nights in towns but it can even happen in daylight with people around like it did with me. I had bad situations 3 times in the first week. This isn't to say that everyone is awful- far from it! There's been good people there (like Stefán Karl) just as there has been anywhere. I met two extremely kind folks there, too. Stay safe.
The gum powder and whistle are candies I had in my hometown in Nebraska central Nebraska growing up.
It’s always so surprising when people doesn’t love Tyrkisk pepper. It’s the only hard candy I enjoy
Mark 26 minutes into the video learning what one icelandic word means: "we're learning already"
This video has taught me that Iceland hates children.
Okay am I missing something? Why do they have ethans dog lol
BRO SAID "SOCCER" 😭 It's a swedish candy and "socker" in swedish just means sugar
He looks like the hippie at college who plays guitar and doesn't shower alot
Icelander here. The salty nightmare is one of my favorite candies. I always felt that its super sour instead of salty but i could just be immune to salt at this point.
Man, don't you just hate it when you get trapped in Markpilers mind, not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES!!
I miss old Markipler
I never knew I needed Mark eating sweets ASMR until now.
11:01 Mark suddenly speaks their language!?!?!
The screaming when mark drops something is sending me
i know nobody cares about this information but i actually live in iceland
Idk why I thought he was gonna say "my grandma... Is dead" 😭 4:40
this some swedish shit
what's with the sound on this one? x.x it goes quiet and loud nonstop, my audio is so high and it still hard to hear a lot lol
My great grandmother was born and raised in iceland and i cant help but laugh at the reaction i know she would have watching you eat all this. Unfortunately she left us around 4 years ago but this brought back many fond memories. Thanks Mark
Wait we dont get a tally to show us if you were right or wrong 😂😂
Henry in the background of the whistle candy like "wuuuuuh?"
Ammonium chloride means salt😂
Pin balls are from the Netherlands brw
S U P E R A L T
THREE PUPPIES!!!
I eat the Melody pops!! I loved the tunes he played. The jingle introcucing each candy was so cool! 17:59
OHMYGOD THAT WHISTLE LOLIPOP WAS LITERALLY MY CHILDHOOD!!! But in my country its red and a  bit transparent theres also cola flavour :P
Has Mark tried Japanese candy before? *Weeb asking*
Did he just bite on candy that suppose to suck on? 😮 This man's teeth!
No clue if they're originally from the UK but I live in Britain and used to eat those melody pop things and the pinballs all the time as a kid
it's so fun to see that some of the candies we have in finland aswell:D
I laughed my ass off. I am from Sweden. and loves sweets. some I recognized some I didn't. but the red and white is peppermint. something that we Swedes eat mostly around Christmas. you really miss out on the tubble gum. it's very good. but thanks for the video and lots of laughs
my favorite type of Mark videos!!
Icelander here! I'm going to translate the candy names as best as I can :D  1. Jólaköttur literally means Christmas cat (also we have cats in Iceland mark, you weren't looking well enough) 2. It's 100% icelandic candy, I can confirm!!! 3. Trítlar means little people I think 4. I have never seen that candy before in my life but also Icelandic 100%, confirmed, tested and theorized! 5. Stjörnu Rúlla means *The Star Roll* even though it doesn't look like a star at all 6. Chocolade og pepermint means poison 7. Tyrkisk Peper probably means Turkish Pepper, correct me if I'm wrong also don't chew it please you're doing it wrong mark please stop 8. Melody pop means Söngsælgæti in Icelandic (æ is pronounced ayeee if you say it correctly) 9. Nipple (from Sweden) 10. Hockey Pulver is from Denmark probably and we all hate Denmark 11. Maoam is most definitely a subsidiary of Haribo, a German based confectionary company. 12. Súper Sett Lakkrís Bitar means Super Set Licorice Bites 13. Opal is just the name of Opal, which is a disc shaped candy called Opal. Alot of old and boring people eat the red boxed variant of it. 14. Regular non Icelandic mint probably 15. Djöflar means Devils, apparently there are multiple devils in Iceland, including the Danish... good to know. (ö is pronounced kinda like uhhh but more extreme!!!) 16. Blah blah, not Icelandic 17. Risa Þristur (Þ is pronounced like "Th" in thunder) means Giant Triple (or maybe Triple Giant???), there isn't a good way to explain the name... 18. My favorite!!! School Chalk (not Icelandic though) 19. Turkish Pepper 2, Electric Boogaloo! (fun fact, in Icelandic we say Tirkis Pebber (pronounced in an Icelandic way)) 20.  21. Lakkrís Rör means the thing that the youtuber said, it's correct, hooray!  22. Mark, most of the candy in the video (including this one) was (sadly) not Icelandic so here's a cool list of authentic Icelandic candy that I recommend! Hraun, hákarl and hrútspungur (all of the good candies start with H)!
I love these videos, and I really WANTED to watch this, but the sound of the chewing is SO LOUD I cannot watch this without either punching my phone or throwing up.
37:08 playdough
Tritler looks like historical 😐
Lesss gooo
😂
Me from island   Me sad i didnt see mark
Is Lixian still your editor?
Iceland has a shit ton of cats, Reykjavik is known for having lots of stray cats
most of these are swedish lol
Amy is so lucky, mark is by far the worlds silliest man and I love that about him
Hi mark i´m from Iceland and the roll you ate they change the recipe for it and made it more salty miss the old one. hopefully you had an amazing time in Iceland but the cat on the candy is a company of iceland
4:39 that's swedish candy 11:34 that's swedish candy 20:22 that's swedish candy 21:56 that's swedish candy 29:10 judging by the packaging and the candy itself, that might be swedish 31:27 can't exactly tell if it's swedish, but it's either swedish or finnish(?) 36:33 that's danish candy, it's very great compared to other liquorice because it's not super overpowered by the liquorice flavor and it's also quite popular in sweden
Today I learned the US doesn’t have maoam sweets
I remember having those slide whistle pops when I was little but I don't see them around anymore, maybe america was like "TOO DANGEROUS....for American children.. SEND THEM ELSEWHERE!"
In the Netherlands, it's called Salmiak, and I hate it too. xD it's really gross.
Maoam is pronounced ma-oo-am just like it's spelt lol
LMAO watching you try Finnish salmiakki
5:53 / 49:41 yes it was the swedish flag
How dare he talk shit about turkinpippuri/turkish pepper. Btw its from Finland
Markiplier is giving me Captain Jack Sparrow vibes-  ALSO FUN FACT!  Did you know that modern Icelandic has not changed much from Old Norse? Icelandic people have little to no problem understanding Old Norse literature and could probably have a better time having a conversation with someone back then in say, the 1200-1300 Scandinavian era. They even teach Old Norse with Icelandic pronunciation.   I’m also studying Old Norse so- 😅
Bro. You goootta do danish candy next😂
i love markipler's and Amy's humor
The fact that Mark’s fucking candy whistle melody became a recurring motif, it’s hard to beat that sort of creative serendipity.
Are they in Ethan’s house?
i love markiplier's and amy's humor
YOU THOUGHT HE WOULDN'Y DO ANOTHER?!? TO SHAAAAME
should have been "I review LIQUORICE candy" AAHAHAHHA.
Saudi Arabian candy  pplss
Mark is looking more like a pirate with each passing day. The only things he needs now is a pirate hat and a parrot on his shoulder  Edit: Holy crap I didn't know I'd get this many likes. But yeah, he looks like he could be in Barbossa's crew
for some reason it unsubbed me
the whistle candy earned my like as soon as he figured it out XD
CHICCCCCAAAAA
The whole volcano-less island is so happy someone mentioned us ( in a not natural disaster way ).
Bro: I dip my salt, in salt, because SAAAALLT!  Me: Your ARTERIES! Stahhp!!   Also Bro: This gum wasn't sealed, that's not safe.  Wut.
when he said plane i thought he was going to say "towers, two of them"
Hey mark loved the vid and love to see ure humor still be strong. How's our beloved chica doing? Haven't seen from her in a while.
The center powder in the Tyrkisk Peber is Saltmiac. Made from hydrogencloride and amonia. It's in a lot of licorice from the Nordics.
I’m just waiting for “Volcanoes aren’t real,” to be on a Markiplier out of context video
you’d think watching foreigners try salmiakki would get old... it doesn’t 😂😂
YES MORE REACTIONS
"If i get theis, i can retire" Mark please, we're still recovering from Matpat 😭
I just watched an hour of markiplier eating candy
bro could be the next captain Jack Sparrow
Mark pls pin me I love ur vids and I’m rewatching every fnaf game you ever played im literally ur biggest fan I’m being so Fr ur my favorite fnaf player and YouTuber ever pls pin me 🙏
I freaking love black licorice but I also had a similar reaction to that salty filled log kind. It was so jarring lol
you gotta review Finnish candy
WE ARE SO BACK
On my birthday how special I'm iclandic
The wistle bid had me dying
I’m just waiting for the inevitable “Sent to the Hospital” video that’s coming soon after this one…
He didn't look for a partnership with anyone in this
Hockey pulver 🇸🇪
9:14 OMG!  I loved Bubble Dust as a kid (and we had in Indiana)... don't know how it would fair today but I got that every chance I had.
im special?
Can someone tell me which g-star jacket that is ???
I missed this series
I loved this, thanks Mark and Amy!
im from the uk and the powder gum, i have never seen it before XD
Good  to see marks lenses being put to work
The music while waiting for Mark to decide what category to put the licorice roll had me waiting for him to say smash
Mark is giving Jack sparrow with the hair
I demand Amy comments all the time!!
so mark went to the land of licorice
31:43 the memes I'm gonna see from this 1 clip
Now do swedish
😂😂
Lixian’s little commentary of “happy Amy noises” got me, that’s an amazing touch😂😂😂
Other Youtuber: "Hello Guys, I'm today here to review some candy, lets begin..." Mark: "YOU ARE IMPRISONED IN MY MIND FOREVER, Also If you saw you while being in Iceland, you are cursed now! Anyways here is some candy from Iceland..."
BRO IM ICELANDIC. ARE YOU TELLING ME YOU WERE HERE??????
Them pinball things are from the uk or I think they are
Why is Jack Sparrow here.
turkish pepper is a finnish candy ^^
The pain that I felt when he called the mushroom guys nipples... I'm sad
Mark btw the bubble dust or jerry can candy is also in Canada
can't wait for mark to try some Brazilian candy
We entered the intrusive tenth mind when he suddenly said "I bought a lot of candy from Iceland."
tw misophonia
Islaaaaaaa is that the Swedish flaaaaag?
Yeah it is the swedish flag.
As an Icelandic person it honestly hurts how little there is of actual Icelandic candy in this video 😭
The gummy thing in chocolate is completely normal, try the marvelous creations cadburies chocolate there's ones with gummy pieces and kinda like smarties/m&ms (in the UK smarties are chocolate with a sugar shell on like m&ms but made by the company nestlé n i prefer smarties personally)
I like the occasional British sweet jumpscares in this video.
He looks like a pirate and I dig it
Plss pls markiplier try türkish candys plsss ahh i am from Türkiye and i love you so much😊...
guys is mark okay, he keeps wearing durags in his latest videos, is he sick? Maybe I'm just too concerned :(
Watching this while eating ikea chocolate
At least Mark hasnt left us yet
he looks like hes going through so many stages of grief (especially the spicy-licorish and deciding whether its icelandic or not) also: 18:30
I think mark would have a blast doing a candy review of just chupachups products.
I’m waiting on him to one day in the middle of a video just stop and ponder for like a minute. Then everything fades and it’s suddenly back to pokemon “……………..smash…………..” and then he goes back to the video like nothing happens
eating the gummy licorice coin things "ITS GUMMY!! its not hard!" spits it out, onto the next flavor "alright lets try this one" *CRUNCH* ._.
The close ups are reminiscent of a documentary video where Mark is tearfully recounting his abduction by aliens. Or perhaps tearfully recounting his many experiences with licorice. Works either way.
I'm laughing so hard at the part where he said, "I don't want that in me anymore." 😂
I love how mark makes one mistake with the Swedish candy and then basically doubles down on getting things wrong with England.
Alternative title: Mark struggles to open candy wrappers for an hour
Given people from all around the world watch mark, i would like some help! Im going to England, Scotland, and Wales in april and wondering what brands/treats i should bring back. Interesting things. What brands do you guys like?
What an intro! 😂 👏  His faces are the best too.
the cloride is used to make dry batteries so dont eat it maybe
its swedish candy and not icelandic 🤣
The last ting Mark ate was Licorice by Bulow and it’s a danish brand! I’m from Denmark myself and I usually don’t like licorice but that brand is SO good! Just so sad it’s so expensive😅
Tyrkisk peber.. SOUNDS ICELANDIC: mark.. dammit its Danish -_-
do icelandics only eat licorice?
Those "nippies" are mushrooms
I missed these so bad! Amy sounds like she’s doing great, and Chica and Henry were there!! Man you guys made my sick-with-rona time so much more enjoyable ❤
I saw Marks face and Iceland and was like, idc whaats going on I need it
❤
Sons of Forest?
mark fun as always, lixian edits...  oh yea bb, his efforts dont go un-noticed
honestly thank god he brought this series back, need more markiplier makes tho
I have good news.. *CRUNCH* I... have bad news. Best part made my damn morning thanks Mark.
watching mark eat licorice after licorice was great. especially when your nordic so you Know whats coming
Marks energy in these videos is always like a real life captain jack sparrow and im loving it!!
Why no more try not to laugh challenges? :(
Huh... America doesn't have Maoam? I don't know where they originate, but they're fairly common here in England. They're very nice and come in a variety of styles and flavours.
I missed these reviews videos 🤣🤣 So professional
14:42 "I do not have the mental fortitude to not bite this candy"  We've seen you "eat" Takis, Mark
well, if amy and mark wanna try indian candies... i have a list. i have such a good list. i don't have the strength to comment that rn. maybe some other day if someone reminds me. but for now, i shall gatekeep the delicacies.
"I bought a load of candy from iceland" I'm British n we have a shop called Iceland so my first thought was "the shop or the country?" Lol I don't even know if you have iceland the shop in the US but its obvious you meant the country anyway I just think of dumb jobs all the time because they make me laugh lol
I see they discovered Salmiakki lmao
Markiplier I think there making a resident evil 9
when he said “not my grandma. my grandma, is korean!” i thought he was gonna say “is dead”💀
We used to have the same jug of gum in the US. It was called Bubble Jug and it was delicious. I think it was by hubba bubba
I can smell the licqourish through the phone
I am from Sweden😅🤣 and the candy he ate that he said was probably Swedish and he put it on the Icelandic is from Sweden and yes it's a combo between raspberry and licorice and here in Sweden it's called "hallon och lakris" try and pronounce that! I my self enjoy it very much!😊I really love these typ of videos mMrkpliers since it gives me comfort🥰
Please pluck them nose hairs, kthxbai
4:42, doesn’t he also have a white grandma too? I don’t think his dad was Korean? 😂
“It’s so full of though vim and vigor” - Markiplier
T Gum kindle looks like a toothpaste tube to me...😮
My gosh how much time did Lixian spend editing this?! Whatever he's being paid it's not enough, lol
Speaking of salt there's a newer one chip challenge where instead of it being spicy its salty.
i want him to go to phillippines next
this is my favorite kind of intro thank u lixian o7
Mark, will you play some Palworld with wade and bob 🙏
31:42 saving this for my own entertainment
What happened to chica and her legs??
I miss these like product review type of videos
1ST Review of the Year with Markiplier
Man what a journey eating that Tyrkisk Peber candy was.
I like how Mark is trying Icelandic candy, but Tyrkisk (Turkish) Peber is Danish, along with the Skole Kridt (School chalk). And i grew up on these
markiplier please play voices of the void
Yeah ur right, melody pops are from Australia im pretty sure (they are extremely popular here)
Ammonium chloride is the scientic name for salmiak or sal ammoniac. Its the stuff that makes salty liquorice salty.
Next try German candy
usually on the melody pop it  has a song and the notes written in the wrapper
Markiplier: “Alright enter my mind” Markiplier: "Plane, Air, " My Mind: "towers"
Reykjavik is known for having hundreds of street cats everywhere
45:37 Slow crafted but it came out fast
Slow crafted but it came out fast
Mark..... it's Slow Crafted.
Okay, so because of this video markiplier is gonna be famous in Iceland haha xD
We had powdered bubblegum too in the US. It’s called BubbleJug 😅
I love Skolekritt (chalk), it's one of my favourites!
Mark is looking more and more like Snake these days. No notes.
That jingle better show up in other videos
with that roll thing i though he was going to pull one of those ___ with markiplier things and have us decide if it was or not
31:41 him trying to pronounce the candy is actually just him speaking simlish.
should review some norwegian candy and brun ost (brown cheese)
Day 4 of asking when is phasmophobia coming back?
Mark. The red gummy could be blood. (this is a joke don’t spam me)
bro iceland is lowkey built different, rotten shark is a “delicacy” and it’s disgusting
6:34 this part cracked me the fuck up
This vídeo has TOO many markiplier's close up shots
Can you play kinitoPET? Please! Its really cute and well-made, but not many people know about it, so if you play it, it might get popular!
Day 1 of asking you to revisit on the Little Nightmares Franchise
try swedish candy! and then if you do it you must try the candy svensk jävlar.
Tyrkisk peber is actually a Finnish candy😅
Adding the whistle totally stole the show fr. had me giggling like a dumbass
the third is definitely swedish (I don't know icelandic though) because gott is swedish for god example: gott mit uns = god is with us or something along those lines
That puck is something we put on hockey pucks
Jólaköttur = Authentic second candy is swedish through and through. Trítlar = Authentic Bubbledust never in my whole 33 years of live as icelandic have i seen that in stores XD Stjörnu rúlla = Authentic not familiar with that peppermint chocolate piece, unless its one of the silly tourist trick-to-by thing. Tyrkish pepper is not icelandic XD ( btw turkish pepper disolved into a vodka and you get Hot&sweet ) Chupa chup melody isnt icelandic XD Gummy Mushrooms ( the nipple as you call it ) swedish XD Hocky Pulver is not Icelandic XD Maoam saddly isnt Icelandic XD Súper sett = Authentic Opal = Authentic ( that version is supposed to eat together, yellow and black together) The Mint is multi country but not icelandic auth. Djöflar ( demons ) = Authentic Bubble gum tube not Icelandic ( this is its usual form, the lit is like that and its jelly type with gum paste. squeeze it out and eat it) Þristur = Authentic Skole kridt is not Icelandic made :P Tyrkish..... same is the earlier tyrkish hehe Frisia isnt from Icelandic Appolo Lakkrísrör = Authentic  Last and final... not from iceland XD  Should have Asked a local about what to get. Licorice isnt the only candy we own. Staur, is chocoloate coated, crisp bisguit shell ( similar to icecream cone) filled with soft delicious cream for example.
Next time you should try Italian snacks, I can suggest you a bunch
wow this video looks great. WHAT LENS DID YOU USE?  also 45:46 "You know me, big dick money bags" 💰
second candy is swedish from a city called gränna, they are known for making candycanes of all sorts of color combo and flavors, visited alot as a kid,Fazers turkish pepper is Finnish. The "nipples" are mushroom candy from sweden, hockey pulver is swedish. i would never eat any of these, there yucki, the majority of the licorice candy is finnish the powder insde is licorice
Mark: "Plain. Air. Sky."  My brain: *tower*
These videos are always so funny. It’s nice to have Amy in a video again!
The idea to use that jingle though 😂 10/10 it works so well but it is also hilarious
the second candy is not islandic its actually european. theyve sold that off as german, french, belgium and dutch candy from where ive been
i thought he was gonna say "my grandma... is DEAD!" 💀
As an icelandic person..this is hard to watch.
now i can't unsee captain Mark Sparrow, thanks!
Is that really the state of the world? We cant imagine a fictional island with volcanos on it in case some snowflake gets butthurt?
Socker means sugar, so it's salty sugar
I have never seen the gum powder in a Jerry can in the uk
Why have u got Spencer?
The "nipples" (they're mushrooms), hockeypulver (hockey powder) and maoam (but the original bricks, not the balls) were my favorite candy as a Norwegian kid. I think Mark would really like vepsebol, which is strawberry flavored hard candy coated in powder sugar and with sour powder on the inside
43:47 I hate how barely any of the comments talk about this I know he already probably said his feelings about matpat leaving elsewhere but this is wholesome and I love it and if you dislike it then that’s fine by me
I'm Icelandic and I don't like comedy but this now this is funny YouTube man
holy shit i looked up the nutrition facts for the djoflar, the super salty one, and per 100g of the candy, there is 1.2 GRAMS of salt. thats 1200mg, or slightly over half the max daily recommendation on a 2000 calorie diet. for comparison, 100g of peanut m&ms have about 48mg of salt. sheeesh
the melody pops are sold in tescos in the uk (i assume the whole uk, since theyre sold here in scotland) and they are as annoying as you think they are when parents pick one up for their kids at the start of their shopping trip and they whistle the whole way around the shop. maoams and flying saucers are also british staples but a lot less annoying
Mark Sparrow
amy is the best part of the video
im glad there was a type in there just like the "swedish bastards" licorices i like. the one he said was his least favorite is my favorite i like to order, ammonia as a flavor is wild.
Lixian is THE BEST editor ever!
Although the European Union now regulates the use of ammonium chloride to 0.3% in most foodstuffs, there is no specific restriction for it in liquorice or ice cream. At a level of up to 7.99% ammonium chloride, salmiak pastilles are considered a "traditionally-applied medicine to assist expectoration in the airways". though has to be ingested in moderation.
Gränna is a place in Sweden where they make a lot of hard candy.
Markiplier tries the one chip challenge(salty/sour one)🙏
translating the icelandic once and telling witch is and is not from iceland jólaköturin- crismas cat(from folklore) yes from icelnd 2 was not so idk what it translates to but its tastes good Trítlar-dosent have a translation but yes it our candy the gum is not icelandic. stjörnu rúlla is star roll and yes i have never seen that chocolate and peppermint so i have no idea tyrkisk peber is danish Chupa Chups is Spanish. they made the flute the MUSHROOMS are swedish hockey pulver is swedish the pinballs are german super set is icelandic without a dout cuz i love it and i went to the factory once with my dad opal is icelandic the mint is just a mint idk were thats from freyja is an icelandic company and that candy translates to devils and ya we really like our salt tubble gum is french þristur translates to 3 and its one of my favoret candy of all time and its icelandic allright (Þ and ð/Ð make the th sound so its pronounced thristur skolekridt is danish  tyrkisk peber is danish frisia is from the netherlands lakkrís rör is liquorish straw and yup thats us the expensive looking one is danish
so the cat from the candy is a story that kids we were told in iceland and it basically was just if you were not behaving in the winter (13 of december to the 24). And if u did not behave the cat would capture u and bring u to the cats owner (Gríla) and she would make u and all the children that would not behave in to a human soup. so the story was just to make kids behave when christmas was
Maoam actually originates from Germany, where I live; I also love them! Various forms of Maoam exist, including sticks, bars, and balls, like to the ones you've received. But most of those are probably not Icelandic 😂
I love how at least 15-20% of all this candy was danish, as well as his "favorite candy" is danish too
Note to self: Don't go looking for sweets in Iceland unless you like specifically-black licorice and/or salt.
Icelandic people in the comments: Talking about everything but whether it's authentic candy.
In Europe we have a lot of similiar candies. But god i'm glad we do not have licorice in everything
The next Jack Sparrow
I grew up with that whistling sweet 😂 Not sure where it's from, but I'm in the UK. I don't remember that petrol can bubblegum though, never seen it before 😂
I've been to iceland, absolutely loved it, but yeah the candy seems to be: ah this one isn't salty, that's not too bad... is that liquorish? god damn it - spit it out!  Also, why do you guys salt things with ammonium chloride?! You're even worse masochists than Mark! It's literally just bitter salt and you're right next to a huge source of sea salt! just use that. Are you all secretly on a low sodium diet or something?
the second one is swedish i should know bc im from sweden
Dutch?! *is offended in Danish*
The second candy is actually Swedish, it says "Hjärtligt gott från Gränna". Essentially meaning "Hearty goodness from Gränna".  Also the "nipple" is actually a mushroom.
I enjoy this Nordic candy review video. Hope he'll maybe do more European candy review videos (especially the rest of the Nordic candies).
Trust that anything with the name ''Salmiakki'' in it will be incredibly salty.
He’s so attractive
The timing of the upload of this video is funny considering I’m literally on my way to Iceland right now lol
So from googling, it seems that first candy bar is icelandic and named after a nightmare cat from their legends lol.  The second one is definitely swedish. Franssons Konfektyr is Swedish  Three I'm assuming is icelandic as the parent company uses .is  Four is pretty clearly not icelandic lmao  Five is icelandic  Aaand i'll watch the rest later
I would love to be able to pack him a box of middle europe/czech candy and send it to him. Sadly he would probably not review it bcs health hazzard and the travel there would be a disaster for the candy
4:29 me when I try to speak a German word
Turkey next?
Root beer+red vines is basically the American equivalent, also knowing mark's history with alcohol....  Also I heard that the American idea of licorice is not actually licorice, ('Black licorice' is an abomination called licorice)
Takk fyrir að éta íslenskt nammi þótt sumt af þessu var frá Svíþjóð eða Danmörku.
Water is important....DRINK IT
This quickly changed to "trying Swedish candy" 😅
Whats up with all the swedish candy? lmao
i love his review videos so much!!!!!!!!!!
half of these are in germany too, but without so f*ing much lickerish
Marks Food Reviews are probably my favorite videos on Youtube. Good shit
Svampar = mushroom 🍄
Are you going to play zoochosis when it releases
48:04 SPENCER!
best muckbang ever
He's gone full Solid Snake
"I was in iceland" Me sitting in the middle europe "HE WAS HERE?! ON OUR CONTINENT?! AND I DIDNT KNOW?!" having no way to travel to iceland :D
Is tyrkisk peber (Turkish pepper) actually Turkish ?
Finally the SourPatch King is back to review some more!!!!
The melody pop is from England im pretty sure also i think there's sheet music in the wrapper
I remember going to a store and buying gum in a tube
But which is which?
Watching people outside the Nordics, especially Americans, experience salmiakki (ammoniumchloride) for the first time is always fucking hilarious 😂 oh, and by the way, Fazer is Finnish 😀
Mark please just finish fnaf hw 2 already
You should do a french candy review, the french have some really interesting candy
This video was delightful
Im confused what did mark mean by chicas new legs coming in nicely did she have an accident or something?
Maoam is my childhood candy! It's a German candy! I am German :D It's  pronounced Mah-Oh-Ahm (like the A in Arm) and it is produced by Haribo, which is also German the tubble gum is also german. literally had german written on it.... and uh yeah. it normally has a safety metal thingy on it... it's normally bright ass pink...and tuti fruity flavour
I eat whole bags of Djöflar and they are delicious
So... The djöflar (which i suppose is devils?) Is 1, best candy. And they think that is salt? I wanna see them try "svenskjävlar" 😂
@LixianTV you need to send mark some portuguese treats, or make him come here to review them
Djöflar is one of the pinicles of Icelandic salt liquorice delicious. And it looks like Mark couldn't take it.
Licorice: The video
48:29  "Amy went for it again"   Oh my God, Amy's also "Not A Masochist"
Watching this from a country with the most active volcanoes in the world   I can truthfully confirm that there's no volcanoes *here*
aaah.. i cant watch this.. i just had sweet lunch.. and my teeth hurst just looking at it xDD later..
I would love to send you candy from my country!
I don’t understand why one of the leading creators of iron lung the movie is eating Icelandic sweet treats?
all of a sudden i want to meet Mark real bad.. and just shake hands.. :(((
I had that bubble gum all The time as a kid its normal lol
I was so happy seeing Mark trying Whistle Pop <3 Those were the best, and I miss them till this day - they're not selling in my country anymore
As someone from the three nipples community, I feel very special. Thanks Mark
It's really unfortunate that he was misled and missed out on more authentic Icelandic candy – there's so much more to experience. Also, there's a noticeable trend in Iceland now where a lot of service industry staff, like with the guide and in restaurants, aren't from Iceland. This often leads to a language barrier, as many don't learn Icelandic, and it can be frustrating for locals who have to switch to English.
mark needs to try svenskjävlar. just sayin…
second candy is from sweden, AND I CAN SAT THAT BECAUSE I'M A CERTIFIED SWEDE, FIGHT ME
45:48
As a finnish person, it's funny to see Mark eat tyrkisk peber and hockey pulver and not like it because its salty licorice also know as salmiakki
AUSTRALIAN TASTE TESTING NEXT!!!!
TRY ISRAELI FOOD
Can't wait for Markiplier to try "Svenskjävlar"  Also proclaimed: The world's saltiest licorice...
You should play In Sound Mind🌸💗🌸
You should play Asuras wrath with the original Japanese voices. It's a classic game that barely anyone knows about 🌸💗🌸
You should play Maize. 🌽 It is a really odd funny game that you would absolutely love 🪷🌸💗🌸🪷
Scp-173 lookin monster gummy candy lol. What is it rlly
I actually loved the slide whistle jingle in between snacks!
Markiplier, eating the candy with swedish on it and the swedish flag: "This is probably authentic" Me, eyes twitching: 🙂yeah dude.
most of these candies were swedish lmao
can you rewiev candy from norway
can you do a rewiev of candy from norway??
As an Australian 🇦🇺 I can confirm I have no clue if these candies are or aren’t from Iceland 🇮🇸
Markiplier... try some slovakian candy
im dutch and i loved watching mark try the plethora of salty liquorice i absolutely hate but my granddad loves 💀
20:49 bro I’m not gonna say it but don’t act like you haven’t you know what I’m talking about.
Yes?  No?
The jingle needs to be a running gag in future videos or hide it in your new movie as an Easter egg lol
That lolipop melody brought me to new hights
MARKIEPLIER  I forgot to tell you smth one night  atFlumpty s 3 has started year2021 would you like to make a video and play a game?Flumpty s32021
the grandma candy is also ducth but idk wich country it's originally from. edit : the skol krijt is also a thing we have in the netherlands. It's licorice meant to look like chalk. another edit: the ufo frisa candy too.
That jingle is great
Why does Mark looks like a slightly Korean Caleb Shomo
Can't wait for iron lung
So American Food Safety Standards is a high bar now?
imagen if there was actually no licorice in any of them and it was just a bit he was doing.
Why is mark a pirate
Mark, I love you. You are... so big brained. But please.... if not for us, do it for yourself, please cut your finger nails.
this is how scandinavian countries that didn't have chili made spicy things. ammonium cloride made into salmiac in different degrees and added to salty things.
you should try some balkanic candy
mark i beg u can u try slovak candy?
Mark looking at the Pack with the swedish flag on it "I’m willing to bet that this is authentic"
Volcanoes aren't real.  They're zits of the earth.
Keanu Reeves food review
I would love to see mark try Svenskjävlar
with tyrkisk peber, when they say "hot", they do not mean spicy, not chili. it's... the blast of PURE SALT ESSENCE i think?
this ep. feels like a dora the explore episode idk why but it does
I love the jack sparrow look mark .long hair looks good on you man .
According to an icelandic friend of mine, very few of these candies were actually icelandic in origin - and said friend suggested that he could hook you up with better (and actually icelandic) candy if you were so inclined, Mark. Take that how you will. I actually recognised the swirly Opal candies! I saw a box of those, albeit green, in a store and even had some. They're pretty alright. I also recognised some of the candies by names (the first bar for example), since icelandic has a very unique way of forming words, even among the other scandinavian languages. Pretty neat. Also, I need more candy whistles in my life.
25:05 for anyone else wanting to repeat this little gem.
Did that candy just say Turkish Pepper?
Alright TIME FOR SWEDISH CANDT OKAY?
Hjärtligt gott från Gränna means: Cordially good från Grandma(I think)
*fun fact* there used to be a “Blár ópal” or “Blue Opal”. They discontinued making the Blue Opal because there were hints of chloroform in the pellets…. Yeah
there's not a single native scandinavian that would tamper with things in a store, it's just... not something that happens, it's how things work here. like leaving a bag unattended when going to the toilet, i've done that before. there's essentially zero chance of it being stolen
Mark should give a concert with the candy whistle
AMY’S BACK
Mark: "I'm more mature than I look."  Me: "Are you sure about that?"
Bro the fact that they feed some of these candies to kids should be a crime already
So such thing mark
the true strength of viking blood is being able to tolerate salmiakk (the uber-salty flavor, something about ammonium chloride was it?) - most of scandinavia loves it
As an icelander I love seeing Mark trying the chaos of Icelandic candy but sad that he didn't get a local to pick for him... cause there are so many options to pick from and not many of his picks were Icelandic so 🤷🏻‍♀️
Soooooooo.... when's the wedding..?
I really want to eat that first candy bar
that was delightful! just seeing this guy ive been following for years try candy from my childhood. i really feel bad for ppl who live here who dont like licorice, its my fav candy (though you really cant eat too much at a time, ive learned that lesson a few too many times)
The video was just Mark trying Scandinavian/Nordic candies while trying (and failing) to pronounce the names lmao so 10/10 video as always
That "saltiest" candy is sooooo good tho. I can easily down a bag of those. And yes, loads of that candy you can buy all throughout the EU
Someone get this man a salt block
what is that face on 0:38 💀
As an Icelandic person, I can confirm that we REALLY like our licorice and salt-pepper things. And I firmly believe it's an acquired taste. I love it when my candy stings my tongue.
The Jólaköttur is christmas thing, we have 13 julelads and they have a mother and father, Grýla and Leppalúði, they also have a cat that kidnaps children for grýla to eat ….. yeah
43:42 i will miss matpat
WOW! Mark Said @37:24 That We Should Give Our Own Rating And He Will Tell Us How Wrong We Were, And If You Go Back To Every Video Of His Since 2012 Not Even One Comment Got A Heart ❤ Or A Reply From Mark. I Don't Think He Will Ever Like Or Reply Any Comment Anytime Soon. No To Be Offensive Or Anything, Just Stating The Facts😅
Omg omg ini seriusan gw habis menang lotre 1M di jaksel
Please try the tubble gum next time, believe me it’s okay; I ate it as kid ( I still love it ). It has somewhat texture like a paste but if you chew it long enough it will turn into a gum. It has the best flavor… for like 3 minutes of chewing than its just 👀
I never seen a pan critique the food put in it 😂 @whatphoto
That 3 minute intro was gold
13:14 interesting noise
the "nipples" are meant to look like mushrooms, and "svämper" is mushrooms in swedish. the fact that they'll more naturally be laying with the flat top down probably doesn't help
Try malaysian🇲🇾candy pls
It’s the WEIRDEST feeling seeing a famous person review stuff from your country when most of the time people forget you even exist on the map💀
12:56 ah yes, netherlands. the famous 6th nordic country
I bet if we had European try American sweets, he'll die from too much sugar (corn syrup) by 2nd candy.
Those whistle lollipops are also in Australia! They actually also have songs you can play inside the wrapper too! 19:51
My chemistry teacher made hockey powder for the whole class once in eight grade, I think that's all you need to know about the ingredients
Everything that comes from Iceland is a bad candy, I see xp
Finally!! The review channel is back 💪💪💪😂
but hey its just a theory a food theory
I love how basically all the things are from Sweden. I can tell. IM SWEDISH! SOCKER IS SUGAR
Maoam is german. Just for your interesst
Hi Mark 👋
Mark is just reviewing danish candy and Swedish. As a Icelandic person I’m a little offended 🤣
Title fix - *Markiplier tries various licorice candies for 50 minutes.*
Amy, Chica, Henry, Spencer and Mark dont realize singlehandedly how much they're saving me with these<3
It was HER! THE SURF DOG!
If I ever see mark trying south african snacks, I'm going to die
Turkinpippuri! [proud finnish noices]
I recognise most of these candies
The sadness realizing Lixian did NOT edit Megalovania in the wistle section :<
Flipping love moams pinballs
I'd like to say I'm a liquorice connoisseur, I love the stuff 😆 and Lakrids liquorice chocolate is the best 😁 seeing that slide into frame made me laugh cuase I knew what it was but I'm so happy he enjoyed it ☺️  RJ's is the best liquorice I've had...so far 😁
here be mark using his paycheck from the lethal company to enjoy icelandic candy.
Is it just me or does some of the moments in this video, mark bring a resemblance to Johnny Depp?
There a no candy's in Iceland! The odds in finding candy there are millions to one!!.                               :) just love Matto and Mark
As a person who absolutely hates licorice, I would not be happy in Iceland I feel like...
am i the only person from the uk who has never ever seen the jerry can sweet
10:15 The eyes of every EFSA employee started twitching violently when they heard this
Can we have that jingle as a markiplier staple in every video. Like as an intro or outro it's so good
Bro i love melody pops so much, i blow so hard into them i hurt everyones ear drums
I wanna see Mark try that sourest candy Black Death and watch his reaction 😄
Is it just me or does Markiplier have a Deer Hunter looking outfit going on? Just thinking out loud 😂
You don't see them as much nowadays as you'd see them in the 90's but you can get most of these here in Germany as well and I'm pretty sure that it's mostly Swedish and Finnish candy what you have (well except the Maoam Pinballs, that's our prided German Haribo gummy goodness ;P ). The 'Risa' and 'Opal' are from Iceland I think
I really like the melody
Love how Marks struggling with the pronunciation <33 Also where are my fellow Icelandics at???
31:50 the black cat is a type of licquorish. I think black cat is essentially a logo
licourice
Of course mark sees the Swedish flag or ‘made in UK’ at the back of the package and still puts it in the “Icelandic candy’ pile 🫠
Turkisk peber!!! Finland almost mentioned! To the Tori!!!!
The jingle is gonna be iconic
43:41 is pure epic.
Do we have a release date for Iron Lung?
Chika appears at 40:00
Kinda disapointed that video doesnt end with horrible mask Mark was talking about jumpscare
Play some minecraft!
I feel like I stared so hard that marks lost in my mind. ~ From an alphabet labelled disabled person.
Amy looking after us with the volcanos because you know, they’re dangerous, thank you Amy 🤞🤞
Do you know Home safety hotline is fully out.
“But hey… Yolo…. ugh, fuck.” “But hey……. Peepee poopoo.”  I felt that.
44:28 i don’t have daddy issues but
Thats not nipples 😭 Thats Mushrooms... 😭
Drop a like if u relate to this camera😂 15:00
So is Icelandic candy really salty?
this is how i find out america doesn’t have maoams
Tyrkisk peber is actually danish!
Mark.. named every nordic country except Denmark and says "Dutch" .. WE ARE NOT HOLLAND FOR FUCKS SAKE
I cant believe there was no surprise candy at the end
I just love how almost every candy that Mark opens just spills everywhere
Markiplier reviews candy, a small part of it happens to be Icelandic
wtf happened with the time stamps? xD
Clearly Americans don't have the refined taste of us Scandinavians
Bro looks like off brand jacksarrow
Don’t go to Hawaii and tell them there’s no such thing as Volcanoes 😂
markiplier seems to doesent  like nordic candy
as a finn i cried a little inside when he made that face at turkish peber, but i also get it 🤣🤣
12:57 Glad to know we dutch people have been promoted to the nordic level XD
Try dutch candy next 🇳🇱🍬
I knew you were in Iceland in November 🫵 I made the elves follow you
Mark: They don't have American food safety standards. American milk: Not allowed in europe.
The mirror holds the key to bevels
Watching this as a Swede 🤣
Mark: is that a nipple? Me, a Finnish person, knowing these candies: IT'S A MUSHROOM
How many pieces to a puzzle on a board with many levels cascade reflection of soulless devils
socker means sugar
spicy airheads????
Mark, please try uk candy. I'm begging you.
The second one (hard candy with liqurice-raspberry flavor) is something I had as a kid. Actually it's something similar but with only raspberry flavor. probably made by the same company. So it's interesting to find out that it has Icelandic origins. I can remember the tast of them just by seeing the shape and pattern. :D
Mark looks alot like a pirate in this video.
Love the tune that Markiplier made. It's also funny to see Markiplier's face change every 2 seconds when he's trying out the candy
I’m just watching an thirty something year old dude taste candys. nvm video is so good
Man I used to love those melody pops, what a great surprise to see it here
Every food tasting video from Mark is so Chaotic 🤣 he has such a picky taste and so honest about what he thinks it makes this type of content so funny🤣🤣🤣
As someone who LOVES black licorice the most this all seems up me alley
Oh that feeling when you know he's saying 'very strong flavor' but he doesn't lol.
Dang it mark I wanna watch Fnaf 🥺
mark go to bulgaria we got good stuff here you will love it
I really wanna know where he was going to go with the first enter my mind thing.
@1:50 mark trying to be scary and having a hair on his cheek 😂
43:40 took away my smile
Classic Salmiak experience
The real question is what was he doing in Europe .also you gotta love the lakris products he's trying 😂 we do our lakris in the Nordic countries
I'm surprised to see the whistle candy... Found it in a (Belgian) store a few months back and had to buy it, it was somewhat softer than a lollypop and fun to whistle! It also has a little melody sheet inside the wrapper for when you're really good at blowing the whistle!  I know the ufo candy, but I've never seen it "paint the tongue".
My Christmas gift for my Mom last year was litteraly two packs of that last candy. I was thinking about it during the whole video as an example of liquorice that might be the most widely palletable
Oh no... *Mark in hospital PTSD*
I did NOT know this was a 50 minute video until it was over and I was reading the comments and someone mentioned it
Þakka þér fyrir, Mark, elska það sem þú gerir á netinu Where in Iceland were you? Rekjavík? Also, if it has shit like "ó" or liquorice or marshmallows in them, it's from Iceland
We love you Mark!❤❤❤
Tyrkisk peber is Danish and means Turkish Pepper
It is one of my favourite past time activities is watching people eat salty liquorice 😂
Help I'm stuck in Mark's subconscious
The joy on Mark's face when he got the melody pop to work
15:40 wait, airheads is a spicy candy? Never even felt like it was to me
Lixian makes Mark's funny even funnier and I live for it
As someone from Iceland i feel threatened
Mark: * sees the swedish flag * Mark: Im gonna say that's from Iceland Me: MARK NO, IT LITERALLY HAS THE CLUE ON THE BAG!!!!
stop eating salt
The "nipple" candy is a mushroom. It's a Swedish candy!  Also they might've gone bad? They're supposed to be soft and slightly chewy, with the most commonly seen flavouring being a soft cream/vanilla on the light side and rapsberry on the other. but they dry up and go hard over time, faster with open air exposure. becoming as he described more like styrofoam and when this happens the flavour also goes. The one he had was licourice and raspberry by the looks of it. Or they're just not made as good any more, haven't had them in years. Might buy some and test when at the store today
Review swedish candy please
Mark...what's up with the headband?
👍
MAOAM MENTIONED
The northern countries in Europe love their liquorice and salmiak xD If you see Salmiak, or a variation, on the packaging, it's ammonium chloride = very strong flavor.  I just looked these things up; Tyrkisk peber (Turkish pepper), Skolekridt (schoolchalk) and the red/white striped hard candy (Bismarck) are danish brands. I couldn't find the origin of Supersalt hockey pulver (pulver means powder), name looks danish but wouldn't surprise me if it's from Norway or Sweden.  The filling in the Tyrkisk peber is salmiakpowder, so it's very much like the hockey pulver.  Also, you are correct about the blue/yellow flag, that's the Swedish flag :)
as a finn, the pronoucement of the tyrkisk peber was hilarious!
Aww Bülow is from a small Danish Island. It's also expensive as heck
I just binge watched all of your/marks irl vids like 5 hours after this came out so ttysm mark I am so hsppy
Im pretty sure melody pops are from Hungary or Slovakia because stores are filled with them
omg the melody lollipop! I had them when I was a kid! We are talking the 1990s in France. Thanks for the lovely memory.  On a side note : not gonna lie, looooved the chaotic intro lol. Sorry Amy! Also, loved Lixian's editing as usual!
i love that the melody pop is from so many places and everyone has core memories of it! as someone from Australia i also loved it!!
Skolekridt is a danish candy. It's supposed to look like the chalkbars you draw on blackboards with. Skole = School. Kridt = Chalk. Yeah.. We're pretty cool lol
He looks like an 80s rockstar
hoping and dreaming and praying for a German Candy Review
I like how he also messed the intro up just like the last candy review lol
something so whimsical about these videos
the second one was swedish, the text was in swedish and indeed, that was the swedish flag
As a Norwegian, wow there are a lot of non-Icelandic candies here 😂 you should have called this “trying Nordic candy” for accuracy. Also I LOVE hockeypulver, it’s just a sweet and salty liquorice powder
You just know he's having the shits after eating all the liquorish. 🤣
Mark don't get me wrong, I love ya buddy. But the way you opened these fuckin candies gave me a stroke.
Oh my God I've had a Dutch ammonium chloride candy, truly nothing like that taste
Ah, you were here around Christmas time! Jólaköttur is the seasonal packaging for VILLIköttur - Icelandic. Traditional, very much so and one of few that does not include licorice or salt or pepper.  Second one, as per the flag, is Swedish.  Trítlar, Icelandic and you might translate it as "shorties".  Never seen the fourth one, not surprised that it is from the UK.  Stjörnurúllur, very popular, been around for ages I feel like. Icelandic.  No idea about the minty chocolate one, never seen it. Might be Icelandic.  Fazer is not Icelandic, but it is another stable so meh.  Chupa Chups, not Icelandic but again meh it's fun.  Another Swedish one.  The Salty Hockey Puck? I always think it must be either Swedish or Danish.  Next one, I don't know, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish? Who knows? Súper Sett - Icelandic!!  Ópal! Traditional Icelandic! Pretty nice when you are on a long car ride and need a little pick me up energy wise. You leave them in your mouth and let them just do their thing. Not my personal favorite, but hey.  Again not familiar with that next one, but I'm thinking that they are artisan? Looks like brjóstsykur, which are just minty pieces so yeah. Might be Icelandic.  Freyja Djöflar - Devils. Icelandic. Note the horns? Foreshadowing.  No idea about the next one. Not Icelandic.  Risa Þristur - traditional. Þristur refers to three so it's a trio of tastes. Icelandic.  Again, Fazer. Not Icelandic.  Still think it must be Danish.  Something Nordic, not Icelandic.  Lakkrísrör! Most often paired with Coca Cola in a glass bottle. Icelandic.  Not Icelandic, but I think it might be Finnish. Well worth the money, they know how to make their thing.   I'm guessing that the museum that you are talking about is the National Museum? Þjóðminjasafnið? My older family members have talked about those cartons - that's how they used to sell milk! It's unfortunate that so much of these candies were not actually Icelandic, the chocolates are very popular and they do not all contain licorice.  Love from Iceland!
Megamind
A FOOOD THEORY
My cat is deeply upset about that whistle candy 😂
Welcome to the world of nordic candy where ammonium chloride, licorice and chocolate rule.
Seeing Americans eating salmiakk (ammonium chloride) liquorice for the first time is hilarious
This makes me so weirdly proud (even though he got everything wrong somehow)
As soon as Mark said "But hey"  -   I was expecting it
15:30 im convinced these are just Hašlerky
43:43 HE DID THE THING
Oh man chubachups melody whistles smacked me with nostalgia, not seen or had them in ages.
WHERE DID YOU BUY THE TUBE OF BUBBLEGUM?!?!? this was commercizalized in france, it is not prechewed and indeed you poke the seal when you open the tube. I used to eat that a lot growing up but then they stopped selling it. The nostalgy I felt seeing this tube!!!
The slide whistle candy usually has a small sheet music plastic thingy inside the wrapper, I’m disappointed Mark didn’t find it, I swear he would have put the thing on 10/10 then xD
Im surprised Mark didn't guess Turkish Peber is....a pepper. They've made some with chilli pepper that's a bit hotter, but the regular ones aren't that hot. My god mothers favorite. Remember always eating them at her place. And my grandmums favourite was the peppermint with chocolate filling 😊😊
My adhd and love of dogs has me staring at them. Thats spencer isnt it?
Does somebody know why he’s in Iceland?  Also LICORICE
For a moment when he was deciding where the licorice roll should be I thought I was in a choose your own adventure like his heist or space with Markiplier.
As a person who lives in Iceland i can tell you that the first candy you ate (jólaköttur) that had the cat on it, its supposed to represent a cat from icelandic story (because in Icelands people say that there were trolls and that black cat was one of the trolls cat)
Amy providing support in the background led to us not having volcanoes anymore 🤣
iceland is the master of unidentifiable flavours
13:33 Markiplier thinking hes strong..... Cant open a pack of lollies
Deeply upset we did not get to find out his accuracy score.
when i was a kid, melody pops had sheet music on the inside of the wrapper with the numbers instead of notes so you could learn to play a little song
Mark please cut your nails, c'mon man
I want that jacket he’s wearing
“I am Mark and I am here to review some candy, there is nothing else to this video..” 👀 Length of video 49:41, Mark, you’re past the point of making short taste test videos. You know us too well and you always deliver.
What we've learned today, Mark thinks Netherlands are a Nordic country 😅
Maybe the candy from 15:00 is Salmiak Liquorice? =/c And yup, the one from 31:19 is definitely Salmiak Liquorice. xD lol And yeah~, THAT liquid bubblegum was opened already by someone. Usually there is some aluminium foil thingy there. O.=.o
oh thats horrible grandma candy
0:31 mark got the captain price smile lol
it is from iceland candy that is carmamel deliciosness
That extra salt candy is how Icelandic people get their faces lol
Shouldnt he be in leathel company now
NEED more reviews from the #1 review channel ever in any website 😊
Back to the reviews…
40:30 flying saucers!!!!! shergbert powder filling with waferpaper shell
7:10 kinda the case of every nordic fairytales actually 😅
as an icelandic person, tyrkisk peber is a cuisine how dare you 😡
the way of the samuria
any south african fans see that first one and thought it looked a bit like a lunch bar and now desperately wants mark to try our snacks??? 😢
Btw, the "nippel" candys are muchrooms. And it's a swedich candy.
turkis peppers are from finland
My cat peacefully sleeping Mark: whistling a storm My cat: 👀🙄
"its just a theory,a food theory"  Matpat whould be proud
I'm sorry Iceland, but your candy is terrible
18:15 I HAVE THOSE WHISTLE CANDYS IN MY COUNTRY AS WELL- Those are so much fun to just, make loud noises with then eat later when i'm done with it
Oi don't disrespect Finnish candy. (turkisk peber)
Why does Mark have Spencer?
Gränna is a town in Sweden, it's famous for its candy ❤
Woah, was this video shot on a Minolta lens
We have melody pops in the uk
You are now trapped in my mind, forever...............    I bought a bunch of candy from Iceland  -Markiplier, 2024
We need Laufey to confirm these or not 😂
Interesting opinions on turkish pepper and teachers chalk
WHEN IS THE EDGE OF SLEEP TV SHOW COMING OUT MARK?!
Please review irish candy with Jack next
the zoomed in camera makes this video feels like a documentary film
Lixian did an amazing job making that intro usable, alright. Its just that I  only watched the intro though 😅
Do polish candy next please we have cool candy here like "baryłki" "michałki" and other :)
Did mark just say no to MILK
Mark clearly didn't notice the Swedish flag
Me sitting here with my morning tea, eating fazer chocolate "Turkinpippureita!" *drooooooooool*
Mark I don't know how you do it, but you are probably the funniest youtubers out there by shear talent that I will ever see.
Imagine if Markiplier got a low taper fade
Why is Mark dressed like a pirate?
mark food reviews gives me life
Pinballs!!!!
The pinched ones are actually french, c'est des berlingots 🇫🇷
Mark looks like a pirate now.
Love how Mark's so excited about that Melody Pop 'cause he never had it before, while in Czechia it's childhood core
love how he can spend almost an hour eating icelandic candy but cant spend more then like 20-30 minutes playing help wanted 2 I JUST WANT ANSWERS JUST UPLOAD MORE FNAF PLZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
„Maybe the red one hated me“😂😂
mark the old you is better
The internet has broken my humor. I paused at 0:12 and died laughing at "I want you to enter my mind... PLANE!"
captain mark sparrow
Yes! The food reviews are back!
First Day Gang
I love Maoam, wasn't expecting to see them in a list of Icelandic sweets lol.
In the Netherlands we have extra extra salty licorice. One of our favorite things to do, is to give it to unexpected tourists or expats. Its delicious Mark. Also in Iceland they even have Yule Cat folklore, a monstrous huge cat who eats people who don't have new clothes at "Christmas ".
It's liquorice isn't it
mark: *sees the swedish flag on the bag* mark: AH yes i think that's icelandic
Watching Mark and Amy discover Salmiak (ammonium chloride) in real time is pure gold.   Some cultures just physically assault you for no reason.
These Markiplier lobotomy fiber optic cable videos are getting realistic about his intros 😅
As a Finn half of these are swedish or finnish
23:02  Oooh, yeah that is sugger.
I screamed when I saw this vid on my feed!!! Mark reviews are back!!!
It's always lovely when Mark uploads
15:23- Mark: Too hot to handle??? 15:59- Mark: Maybe in the centre? *begins chewing* 16:06-16:21 -Mark: *Look of pure dissapointment*
Maoam is a brand of Haribo so German, European? Some of my favorites. Stripes maoam are like European airheads.
As a person from sweden watching this- the second one was from sweden-
Now I want to try the fancy expensive one lol
We have that bubblegum powder here in Mexico.
21:48 is going to be a meme isnt it
"I have good news! Its NOT blue Licorice.... Bad news"
I was so concerned that he wasn't gonna like the Bülow one because that is the absolute quality when it comes to chocolate licorice candy.
im surprised by how many of these we have in the UK!
Just me that thought the plane was a 9/11 referen-
Noooo, tubble gum is so good!! 😩
You know what's just as salty as all the licorice you just ate? Not actually telling us which is native Iceland candy, man you were right there! Then you scaled it from fav. to least fav. after you sucked on some chocolate salty balls. I love you Mark, thank you.  <3
Alternate video title: Oops all Licorice
my mom exploiting me for views
Mark looks like Orlando Bloom in PoTC in that thumbnail. vewy nice 👍
The candy’s screaming as Mark dropped them had me rolling 😅 great job Lixian.
So I get violently ill when I am anywhere near black licorice. I’m not for the misuse of cringe in modern times so when I say I cringed through most of this video. This is the most viscerally terrifying thing on Markiplier’s channel. Hands down
Is Lensiplier using using a minolta 40 for this video?
i didnt know there was that much swedish candy in iceland, thats pretty cool
Lol thank God I wasn't born in Iceland. I despise black liquorice
Damn bruh i was about to fall asleep then you started blasting that damn whistle  😂😂
So apparently there are around 20000 cats in iceland so thats not a food tell
Markiplier: not my grandma, my grandma is-  Me: he's gonna say dead   Markiplier: -korean   Me: oh.
12:46 I was waiting for him to say "Smash" with the music that was playing 😂
Mark: "That's just a theory, A FOOD THEORY!."  Me: Yes... Yes it is...   *2015 Flashbacks start happening *
Matpat:bye Scott:bye Mark:IM STILL STANDING
If that little transition whistle isn't included in the next review video, I'm gonna be so sad
As an icelandic person i am devastated on how many he got wrong
Introducing 4thWallBreakTheory
asmr
More licorice
The Nordics and Europe in general share a lot of their candies among each other, hence why it can be difficult to find what's authentic from that certain country.  Since I knew the majority of the candy and had time to waste,  here's a list for those that wondered the origin of the candies:  1- 2:51 - Iceland(Jóla Villiköttur - Freyja) 2- 4:17 - Sweden(Franssons konfektyrer AB) 3- 6:40 - Iceland(Nói Sírius - but currently owned by Norwegian company) 4- 8:58 - UK(Sweet Bandit - sneaky bubbledust) 5- 11:29 - Iceland(APPOLO LAKKRÌS - Tjörno Rúlla) 6- 13:13 - Denmark(Mols Bolsjer - Chokolade & Pebermynte - Thanks to @Karaleecupcake) 7- 15:00 - Denmark(Tyrkisk Peber - Fazer, originally Danish but owned by Finnish Fazer) 8- 17:59 - Spain(Melody Pops - Chupa Chups) 9- 20:16 - Sweden(Franssons konfektyrer AB - Mushroom nipples) 10- 21:51 - Sweden(Hockey Pulver - Grahns konfektyr) 11- 23:18 - Germany(Pinballs - Maoam) 12- 24:31 - Iceland(Súper sett - Nói Siríus - Norwegian owned) 13- 25:51 - Iceland(Opal - Nói Siríus) 14- 28:27 - Denmark(Mols Bolsjer - Bismarks Klumper - Thanks to @Karaleecupcake) 15- 31:14 - Iceland(Djöflar - Freyja) 16- 33:50 - Belgium(Tubble Gum - Lutti - Currently owned by German company) 17- 35:25 - Iceland(Risa Þristur) 18- 36:28 - Denmark(Skolekridt) 19- 37:43 - Finland(Tyrkisk Peber - Fazer - Made during Finnish ownership) 20- 40:22 -Netherland(Frisia - From Frisian parts of Netherlands) 21- 42:06 - Iceland(APPOLO LAKKRÌS - Lakkrisrör) 22- 45:38 - Denmark(Lakrids by Bülow)
Ammonium chloride is safe in small batches because of how salty it is. It is interesting really.
You know that on the package it says where it is produced
Those people gummy’s look like Swedish fish so personally I’d put it in the not Icelandic section. And for the licorice straw, you said that was all you had drink wise, did you guys not have water? In a cup? That would show how well the licorice straw worked cause the water is flavourless. ALSO MARK REVIEW VIDEO? LIXIAN? AMY SPEAKING IN THE BACKGROUND? PUPPERS?!!! THIS IS AMAZING!!!
Im torn between calling him Captain Markimoo and Beatnik plier
3 camera angles, an editor, and amy. damn this video went too overkill
We have bubble gum dust jugs here in the U.S.   Mark is mostly right. It's a cost-saving effort on the part of bubble gum companies to sell waste product.  There IS a sanitary collection system for it, though.   Also, Mark's dentist is watching this video and putting a down payment on a new Porche right now.
When Mark was saying that he had had spicy stuff before that brought me back to when he did the ghost pepper challenges.
He is tasting basicly  swedish and finnish candys
I love being inside of markiplier
The sliding candy whistle was my childhood and, in fact, the bane of my parents’ existence
theese nosehairs though!
44:44 I swear is that ethan???!?!?!?
Kinda a shame that he didn't try salty dried fish which is the first thing that comes to mind when i think of Icelandic candy's
E
that beer can used ultra instinct lol
dream on Mark lol Lakrids by Bülow already has it in its namexD and I think it's from here, Germany
There are no plants in iceland. Aside from grass and moss. I think they forgot how real food tastes like.
if anyone watching this on a big curved screen idk if im the only one but at 1:28 marks face looks extra funny
When I saw the title of this video I just knew that half the candy was going to be licorice.
ammonium chloride is only edible in very small amounts eating more than a little can mess you up. I'm kind of shocked its just in that candy.
WAIT YALL DONT GET MELODY POPS IN THE STATES?? theyre in every supermarket in spain and theyre so fucking aweful theres always some infant blowing the shrillest note you could possibly imagine at full volume
Anybody else wonder why Captain Jack Sparrow doesn't have his braids in?
31:43 literally the best part of the video 🤣
its traditon evry time mark does candy vid he has to spill the candy lol
volcanos do not have a minds their for Thay don't exist
I have tried the Melody Pops myself and I liked it! Did you see the music sheet? It comes with a music sheet so you can play tunes according to the numbers!
mount krakatoa is a… is a… uhhhhh
He legit has like 5 candies that are from here 🤦🏼‍♂️ I love mark but get a native next time too pick out candy. I almost want too send him a package that actually has Icelandic candy in it not that crap he got.
The camera angles though? I always prefer when you have others to interact with! Just me
The cat chocolates are both Icelandic lol
27:27 Hahaha, the editing is like, 30-40% of the value of videos like this
I used to hate black licorice so much until I became friends with a lady from India who gave me a licorice candy that was about the size of a grain of rice and when it hit your tongue it was like getting punched in the mouth with pure licorice. like it would coat your mouth and tongue and there was all these different flavor notes in there like a creamy, floral, earthy, with a little bit of a bite to it. it was a little psychedelic. Since then I’ve tried licorice from different countries and wow the U.S. really got it wrong.
what happened to chica?!
The color scheme of this video is so aesthetically pleasing
1:44 Markiplier: "You will never escape the maze of my mind"  HA! YOU FOOL!! I have adhd too which means my brain works the same. I'm outa there in 0.nothin. My autism will hate this entire thing. But I'll be outa there in 0.nothin!
LITHUANIA MENTIONED 🇱🇹🇱🇹🇱🇹 8:34
These are the only videos where the actual videos start 3 minutes in
Anyone know what mask he was talking about
hahah I have a friend from Finland and I think they love their licorice no matter in what form xD even ice cream and salty sour etc
9:28  I once saw on TV (many years ago), how they spread a “gum like powder” across ocean water to help collect oil spills.  Just saying.  Enjoy your gum Mark. 👍🏻🤢
Peice of candy......o0o0o a piece of candy!
What is Iceland’s obsession with salt and liquorice
Can Mark drop his skincare routine? like his skin is soo clean
Hearing thd icelandic volcano thing on distractible was like a sneak peek for this.
10:15 " they dont have american food safety standards" i laughed harder at this than i should have, i mean, most of the world seems to have better food safety standards than america, especialyl when it comes to what can go in food lmao
i want pewdiepie to review korean snacks in a vide in responce to marks iceland vid lol
10:35 Mark literally rethinking all of his life decisions
Seeing a gummy always makes me want sour patch kids
We need a remix of Mark playing the candy flute.
Speaking of liqourice, one of my favourites is soft Australian liqourice, it's such a different experience compared to harder liquorices.
Maybe one day you could try belarusian candy. At least there's no licorice in them :D
43:29 1.Confused Mark  2.Pewds playing Minecraft and naming his pigs  3.MatPat after he made that Pokémon specifically so Mark can have an optimal Smash
hahah ah man I loooved the melody candy as a kid
6:49 Okay that sounds like elvish with an American accent
Mark is acc right, volcanos don’t exist!
um the jingle is stuck in my head? Help?
@laufey can you help answer if these are "authentic"
I stole a melody pop 😭
We don’t even know if he was right or wrong about them?
Mark mark, please play Zoochosis when it comes out please please. Love you <3
Volcanoes are just part of the liberal agenda
It seems like Mark filmed this around the same time some of my other family did. Nice! They brought brought some Icelandic candy and such. (Though I think they went to Sweden as well.) I wouldn't be surprised if one of the candy's they brought back made it here. Chocolate caramel covered black licorice.  I hate black licorice. They're not really youtube watchers so they don't know Mark, sadly.
22:30
hello mark! i loved the video but could you please consider using your platform to help spread awareness about palestine? you have such a big impact and it would mean a ton if you spoke up about it!
you tasted full nordic palette
Why does Mark look like a pirate?
I dunno why but I was just watching Markiplier reacts yesterday and then suddenly there's a new video of him reacting to stuff again...and I, I'm just so happy! ✨️😄🎉
Man, Mark is such a himbo
“I don’t want that in me anymore” ~markiplier 2024.
the melody pop candy is one of my childhood candiess here in the philippines, brings back memories of devouring super sweet candy mm~
He finally found it.  The pain that was too great for Mr. See-How-Much- My-Body-Can-Take.
Maybe its because i havent ate in 3 days but all of these look appetizing to me 😂🙈
markiplier be looking like a pirate in this video
6:12 Mark did you not see the Swedish flag on the second bag of candies
mmm tiny yummy people, markiplier vore is now cannon!
Fun fact: socker is Swedish for sugar!
The Shy videos please - r.i.p Shy 2013-2023
This girl rly said what if a volcano goes off, hate this kind of censorship just let the man speak
today you seem to be daptain jack fischbach (and MAOAM is german)
ive had whistle pops b4. brings me back
i just want to be happy. this brings me slight peace of mind.
If I'm not mistaken, a lot of nordic salted candies, liqourice especially, uses ammonia salts and is known for being very strong.
The inception reference is much appreciated
I’m from Iceland and when I saw this on my recommended I was very happy
too close
20:30 My brain screaming: IT'S A MUSHROOM
Actually  he's from Iceland
Does Markiplier have a P.O. box so I can send him some real Icelandic candy😂
Ah yes, the Netherlands, my favourite Nordic country. Come on, Mark. It’s Danish not Dutch
Markiplier treating the desk camera like a middle child
As an Icelandic person I feel so honoured.
lol the one candy with the little people and the scp 173 sound
Just incase it is sponsored, thi vi- It wasnt  but hey, yolo
I'm very disappointed Mark, very disappointed, you managed to make my icelandic mother disappointed as well
He looks like a pirate
I loved those whistle pops when i lived in Germany as a kid i remember them
WHERE IS MY MOVIE MARK? WHERE IS IRON LUNG? DISTRACTIBLE IS LYING TO ME EVERY TIME I HEAR OF THIS! im just excited for this movie, ive grown up watching your vids, so......... yeah
I miss these videos
I feel like the name of this video should've been "Trying Nordic candy that might be from Iceland"
Excuse me but who is that third doggo??
I want the jacket. candy is cool, but i want that jacket
Mark us slowly turning into Jack Sparrow.
I hope the slide whistle transition sticks around.
Me: **rapidly tweaking because Mark put the Grandma candy in the "From iceland" pile even tho it the swedish flag on it** 😊
ammonium chloride is salmiakki, a finnish candy..thing... i love it, it's everywhere here
Toot Sweets! Those were always fun as a kid.
Lixian ,idk if you’ll see this, but you are awesome! Your editing is great and hilarious. Good job. You and mark make a great duo.
With the music I was ready for smash or pass. I’ve been Pavlov’d 😂
I realy would recomend the last one from Lakritz Bülow. Its from Skandinavia and its realy realy good :) 50 bucks is a bit expenisive though. I pay 15-20€ for this. They have so much different flavors.
I AM FROM ICELAND THANK YOU MARK!! 🇮🇸🇮🇸
6:29 markiplier is the plink cat confirmed
Icelandic, clap
I'll never get that whistle tune out of my head. It's the new "lick."
The Lixian scream when Mark pics up the box is my favorite part so far. 27:20
Is biting hard candy just an adhd thing? Because that’s something I’ve always done.
20:20 its not a nipple, its a mushroom
From Wikipedia: "Tyrkisk peber (Danish for "Turkish pepper", often referred to as Turkinpippuri in Finnish, Türkisch Pfeffer in German, Tyrkisk pepper in Norwegian and Turkisk peppar in Swedish) is a salty liquorice candy flavoured with salmiac (ammonium chloride)."  Apparently it's basically edible fertilizer.
The editing is just absolutely delightful!!! 😄
19:06 Spencer comes in wondering either who called them or what the awful noise is.  (Always great to see the Puppers :) )
every foreigner seems to hate Turkish Pepper. its not that bad guys 🥲
markiplier, it has been an honor watching your videos snice i was a kid!, i grew up with you with multiple youtube accounts, and i wish to be as successful as you! i cant wait to keep watching more videos!
As someone from Iceland, it was funny seeing Markiplier chewing down on a reusable straw and downing a jar of mothballs
That whistle sound has some horror game potential
i love seeing mark eating candy from my childhood
In Denmark we use Skole kridt (school chalk) to prank the teachers. Replace their chalk with the candy :)
As if I would watch William Turner (a pirate) eating sweets
Is Mark entering a pirate phase or a biker phase?
5:03  About 5 minutes in and I’m wondering if anyone else noticed how Mark did that one meme here.   That one meme with the lady doing the faces mark is doing here x3
The 3 people from iceland watching markiplier must be happy af
You can get the whistle chuppachup in Aus. I grew up with those bad bois
Ngl this literally came out of nowhere 💀
Giving Jack Sparrow vibes today 🏝️
Why is Mark dressed like an extra from the Walking Dead?
Mark attempting to read the packing sounds like he was speaking simlish
It's licorice.     I was right.
This video makes me want to send Mark package of Finnish candies. I laughed so much watching this!
Majority of them are Swedish, and most of the ones Mark didnt like I love...
you look so good oh my gid
Next please do Indian snack or sweets...
First off, the salt that you didnt know what was (ammonium chloride) is a salt called sal ammoniac or in some cases referred to as liquorice salt(not an official name)because its a salt used in liquorice. It is also what the powder(the middle) in the tyrkisk peber was.   For taste, i would refer to it as a bitter acidic taste
6:00 Mark, Gränna is a town in Sweden known for it's candy canes, and that was indeed the swedish flag :)
Not the mouth noises
This video is spon—  *It wasn't*  But hey, its just a theory— A food theory!-   *Copyright strike*
Wait beer??? but mark!!!!!
Play some Fortnite like a real man lol
Hi mark
Crazy he didn’t like marianne bolcher. I love em.
American food safety standards: 👨‍🦯👨‍🦯👨‍🦯
I've missed this kind of content from you.
Mark please play KinitoPet on Steam, best horror game I've ever seen!
You need to try Swedish candy
Please get Amy in on these, the two of you just trying out candies would be precious and amazing.
-Happy Amy noises- made me laugh idk why 😂
hi
Why is there SO MUCH licorice? 😂
Really was hoping for a jump scare with the mask, but it was almost better without it.
I love the captain jack look
Feels like there's more swedish candy in there than icelandic, and it's funny to see the reaction for some of the candy I grew up with like Hockey Pulver.
I love the fucking Swedish named candy, with a Swedish flag on it, and Mark still says it's authentic.
compilation of mark eating licorice
Please tell me where you got that awesome jacket
MARK PLAY THE SUCKER FOR LOVE NEW ONE
As a Brit, I love seeing Matt enjoy pinballs. 10/10 sweet, the red ones are SO good
So much licorice 😭😭😭
The flying screaming candy just sent me over the edge. 🤣🤣🤣
for anyone looking to buy weird candy: if you see something that says ZOUT (or god forbid dubble zout) it is Dutch for salt. it's just salty licorice. and NOT in a good way. it is hard and salty and leaves a yucky aftertaste and the only person I've ever met who liked it was my very Dutch Beppa and my dad. it is so gross and the salty licorice mark didn't like is exactly what I am talking about.
Bro I grew up on MOAM candies. Him eating the pinball gave me so much nostalgia
What other place are you going to Australia 😂
One) melody pops are my all time favorites and they're SO hard to find near me two) Mark talking about a haunted museum mask made me remember the SCP that lives at the NC Art Museum! Look up "nick cave sound suit ncma"!!
Fazer is a Finnish company not an Icelandic company.
man i’ve missed this series <33
Socker = suger xD it is Scandinaivian.
🥷 won a jac sparrow look alike contest 💀
What I’ve learned from this video: Icelanders love their licorice
We have the same candy in Sweden xD
hot in the same way that lye is hot
AH THE LAVA IT BURNS
About the slide whistle. I can tell you didn't grow up in the 80's because you didn't know to "wet" the whistle before hand to take the dust coating off. You figured it out after humidifying it with your breath. This whistle candy was a bit of a rage back in the mid to late 80's in the Midwest. Cheers!
I love licorice and I am desperate to try these granny candies from the beginning xD
Rip Amy, death by salt candy
Lmao when Mark was talking to Chica my google home told him she was listening 😂
Dudeee please play fears to fathom ironbark look out
Mark can you please make a 3 scary games
So fun fact: there is a popular flavor combination in a lot of Scandinavian countries (which btw is more popularly associated with Finland,) called Salmiakki which consists of licorice, salt, and ammonium chloride. It kinda tastes like you ate a handful of black licorice and salt right before cleaning a not-well-ventilated room with a lot of bleach
Pinballs are my favourite
I somehow can taste the candy just based off of sheer confusion and fear from mark
I think the maoam pinballs are sweedish becuase the ikea near me sells a candy that looks just like the  candy section.
Does iceland not make that much candy as there were many swedish candies and few candies from finland
I went to Iceland 4 months ago and I was so surprised about their Icelandic candy
“If I get this, I can retire”  We can’t lose mark too…
I laugh the entire time seeing Mark in agony eating weird candy
Fun fact... The Icelandic flag is just the Swedish flag, but instead of yellow it's red lines on white. There's also the Norwegian flag, the Danish flag, the Finnish flag, and many, many more... Something something Christianity. Something something Kalmar Union. Sorry I didn't do history.
Mark biting into hard candy breaks my heart. And yes Mark that's just Ammonia aka. salmiak, or salty liquorice.
"You never ever scare me" 👹
This is the weirdest dichotomy. Eating candy and the existential dread/horror in Mark’s eyes.
hey, Mark, if you're ever in the Netherlands, try to find some Dubbelzout liquorish.  Mu ha ha ha.
this made me get up and grab my dubblezouts (double salted black licorice - Dutch)
Me and your dog have the same name😂
I love how the dog came out during the whistle candy like “what’s going on?” 😂
Ammonium Cloride is toxic for humans...
i told u i would send u mexican candyyyyyy
The whistle lollipop is very common in Australia, I don't know if it's Icelandic though.
I'm scared  let me out of your mind😂
the way I immediately knew mark was gonna quote matpat
You should try Norwegian Candy too🇳🇴
The return to reviews… it’s a beautiful day
FINALLY, somebody bold enough to come out and say it! Been waiting years for a larger platform to call out the conspiracy of volcanoes.
I’ve missed classic Mark
fun fact, the state of iowa has many times the population of iceland
My GF is Icelandic, so we made a list of the candy that weren’t Icelandic (it was quite a lot)  - Hjärtligt gott grån gänna (It’s Swedish, the bag has a sweidish flag on it) - Sneaky Bubbledust is british - Tyrkisk peber is danish - Melody pops  - Swampar is swedish (again, swedish flag) - Hockey pulver - Maoam pinballs (is danish, I believe) - Minty candy looks to be danish - Tubble gum - Skole Kridt is Danish - Frisia
What notes are those?
If mark ever develops schizophrenia I imagine he would just walk around talking to lixian all day.
Did you go to Akureyri. I’m from there(and yes there are a lot of cats.
Just what I needed
Try Dutch candy next time 😊
Mark, I think it's licorice...
All those items; we have in the netherlands in a different package 😂
Great video mark u are so funny I watched your videos for years
Hahaha I absolutely love this! Many of these we do have In Sweden, where I live, too due to the popularity of liquorice sweets and daym I enjoy marks face twist Into a grimace when he tasted them XD.
Bro sounds like wolf Link spamming every note during a howling segment when he got his hands on that whistle candy.
eat japanese candy plz
No its candy from "Gräna". It is a place in sweden
Am I crazy or is this the first food review since mark started chewing his food(literally like 2 yrs ago)🫢
"hey what'd you do today?"  "i watched a man eat candy for 49 mins"  "oh...you like.. mukbangs?"  "its actually pronounced markbang"
anyone else remember powdered gum in a bottle like this in the US????? Our ice cream truck had this when I was a little kid.   I think it was HubbBubba and I think, if I can remember correctly it was called Bubble Jug. EDITED***Google Confirms! Hubba Bubba Bubble Jug was a thing!!! It was discontinued at some point between the latest 90s and earliest 00's  I feel like our convenience stores had them until like '03 maybe***
hearing amy also loves chocolate covered gummy bears warms my heart
I really need mark to make reviewing videos more often. I simply love them and I watch them like 10 to 20 times each... Simply great. And lixian... For god sake, don't ever leave us ❤️
Fazer is actually Finnish candy xD Hellooo from Finland, thise are one of our fave candys!
Are you sure these are all candy?
You should review Norwegian candy, it’s the best😁
Hi mark, in sweden we have a candy called "svenskjävlar". I can not explain how it tastes. But it will shock you too your core. Yes it is licorice
So I'm learning Scandinavians like themselves some licorice
Does Iceland have cats? 😂
Strange Lethal Company video. Is this a mod?
Lol, Mark is the new Food Theory.
His flat reading of some of the labels sounded like simlish lol
Boi lookin like Matt Stonie
JAG ÄLSKAR TYRKISK PEBERRRRRRRR
That whistle sound is my wake up alarm now 😂
Ok I know this has nothing to do with this video but markiplier if you see this you might remember when you were playing sister location you said “how long until somebody makes a remix out of exotic butters” well they finally did go check it out it’s AWESOME
Mark: Blows whistle My dog: What......what the......WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?! XDD
I cannot get enough of Markiplier review videos
@22:00 jfc it's like NOT fun dip ><
here for another year of waiting for the mexican candy review
marks dentist is shaking and crying rn
31:43 is how I feel about eating licorice 🤣 I don’t like them
I was very excited to see this video
OH MY GOSH THAT SECOND CANDY I LOVED THOSE AS A KID MY OMA HAD THEM ALL THE TIME I LOVE THE RASPBERRY ONES
Generic video
Yo am i the only one wondering if he straight up swallowed that gum? Just seems like a thing Mark Mr. Licks Taki Dust Off The Chip would do
With the headband on, he kinda looks like Choi Min Soo. Especially when he goes serious 😭😭😭😭😭
the way my dog LOST his mind over the whistle! his head was tilting left and right😭
"Food waste is bad! It's a good thing." Lol thank you for saying this Amy.
This is basically a domain expansion, 3 layers deep? If you are scadinavian and you betray him you never escape? Love that. Could also be a stand
7:38 Those look a little like the crocodile sweets in haribo packs here XD
I'm from Canada and growing up we had basically the exact same thing as the "jerry can" gum called Bubble Jug.
I'm laughing my ass off every time that whistle candy comes 🤣
It’s nice to see this type of video again, it’s more grounded and just chill compared to actual games and other stuff so it’s just a nice change of pace from the usual
When the years goes by I'm starting to see mark is the perfect love child of Jack sparrow and William turner
Mark can probably do good Jack Sparrow impression
icelander here, here's how well mark did on guessing 😅 and a bunch of lore and stats i scribbled down as well.  placements in my list are correct, with a check if mark gussed correctly, and an X if he didn't  Icelandic: 1. Jólaköttur ❌ ("Jólaköttur", meaning "christmas cat", is a special Christmas wrapper for the candy bars original name, "Villiköttur", meaning "wild cat")  3. Trítlar ✅ (the best translation for this i can give is "lil fellas" and im not joking)  5. Stjörnurúlla ❌ (translates to "star roll". disagree)  12. Súper Sett Lakkrís Bitar ✅ (super set licorice bites. yeah)  13. Opal (Sítrónu og Lakkrís) ✅ (this is a CLASSIC Icelandic brand, almost 80 years old now. very weird one but a must try if you ever visit) 15. Freyja Djöflar ✅ (Freyja is the brand name, Djöflar translates to "demons", which is accurate to marks experience)  17. Risa Þristur ✅ ("risa" is just "giant", so a super size version of the original. Þristur translates to triple, which, as mark noticed, refers to the three different flavors present)  21. Appolo Lakkrísrör ✅ (appolo being the brand, lakkrísrör translates literally to "licorice straw". very weird concept to me, but my mom swears this was super popular and cool back in her day. neither of us like licorice though.)   Non-Icelandic: 2. 🇸🇪 Hjartligt gott fran granna ❌ 4. 🇬🇧 Sweet Bandit Sneaky Stardust ❌ (nice try mark) 6. 🇩🇰 Chokolade & Pebermynte ✅ 7. 🇫🇮 Tyrkisk Peber ✅ 8. 🇪🇸 Chupa Chups Melody Pop ✅ 9. 🇸🇪 Hallons Lakrits Svampar ✅ 10. 🇸🇪 Supersalt Hockey Pulver ❌ 11. 🇩🇪 Maoam Pinballs ✅ 14. 🇩🇰 Bismarks Klumper ❌ 16. 🇬🇧 Tubble Gum ✅ 18. 🇩🇰 Skolekridt ✅ 19. 🇫🇮 Tyrkisk Peber (Hot & Sour) ✅ 20. 🇱🇺 Frisia Sour UFO Tongue Painter ✅ 22. 🇩🇰 Lakrids by Bulow ✅❓ (he didn't name a category but the candy was physically placed closer to the correct pile so we take those imo)   Statistics: 63% correct guesses (14/22) 36% of the candy is actually Icelandic (8/22) 77% of the candy is from Nordic countries (17/22) (🇮🇸🇳🇴🇸🇪🇩🇰🇫🇮) 54% of the candy has licorice in it (12/22), HALF of those being Icelandic candy (and also 6/8 - 75% of the Icelandic candy has licorice 😭 unlucky hating licorice in the licorice country)
In turkish Peppers there is cover of liquorice and salmiac powder inside. Its finlands popularest candy
I love how Mark made a whole tune/transition song with that candy whistle. I mean come on, it's begging to be auto tuned and turned into a song!
Yay!!! Your doing this stuff again! I Love this kind of stuff! 🤗💖🥰
DONT EVER EVER TRY CHINEESE CANDY! IT TASTEST LIKE FREAKIN SALTY WALNUT, ALL OF THEM
I have been waiting for this day for two years
my god you look handsome today mark
summary of the video: licorice
Hey Mark, I work at a Movie Theater, and we have yellow salt.  I'm not a salt person, but we get people that ask for a cup of the yellow salt all the time. We even have people steal our salt shaker that is filled with the yellow salt. 😂 He's not wrong, it's very strong salt!!!
Im fully expecting an Icelandic person to come in and be like "yeah those too hot to handle things were firestarters... you ate a firestarter and said it tastes bad."
Shredded cheese is all the remains of others cheese that was cut and packaged, thou there are some strong flavored cheese that is shredded separate   Mark you look quite cool with the headband  Whistle pop is something i remember in the 90's but have not seen for many years, mine were better  How do you have beer but no water?
socker is a vanilla tasting sugar   22:52
Jumpscare: around 7:04
Tyrkisk Peber is originally a Danish candy and is now manufactured in Finland by Fazer Company.
Mark saying "I like licorice but I'm not the biggest fan of licorice" has the same energy as "I'm not a masochist but I like to challenge myself".
Mark can you play once human? Its a multiplayer survival horror game
"maybe it hated me.." Clips to three candy humans(?) brutally beheaded
@6:00 that is the swedish flag
"Ammonium Chloride is an odorless, white powder. Solid Ammonium Chloride is used to make dry batteries and Ammonia compounds, as a soldering flux, a pickling agent in Zinc coating and tinning, and a fertilizer. Ammonium Chloride fume, a finely divided particle dispersed in air, is produced in galvanizing operations." I mean, uh... is it a salt? I don't think... so...
the realization of just how long I've been watching marks videos hit when i noticed he has a few strands of gray hair 🥲
This was posted 10h hours ago and I already feel like im late 😂
I’ve missed this kind of video. Fun to watch Mark increasingly perplexed, lovely to have Amy in the background and Lixian makes it so much more funny. I’d be down for a whole series of this 😂
46:00
45:57
45:53
45:50
Dat ADHD tho 😂🤌
45:45
Amy's reaction to Mark doing his intro makes me suspect she might not be up to speed on Mark's flare...
jumping from camera to camera made this truly a  cinematic masterpiece-
His new life is licorice.
Oh my gosh! Spencer is with your pups! I was like "wait what's that third shadow," before I realized it was him! Wasn't expecting a cameo of him here!
Hi mark! I really love ur videos. I've been watching you for years. You were the first youtuber  I started watching. .. big fan 😍
Mark is looking more n more like a biker nowadays lol
why is nobody talking about Mark’s nails? what is up with those nails? they’re way too long and they look like Mark has been digging in the dirt with his bare hands
The only reason I live iceland is because it has Thorn eth and Ash letters
Chica is a very fluffy pup!
31:43 Mark just went gremlin mode after his body was trying to reject what he put in his mouth lol
Am i the only one who thinks markiplier looks like JOHN WICK?
I never would have expected myself to watch a grown man eat mostly liquorice candy for fifty whole minutes but here I am...
Also thank you lixian❤
Icelandic person here, here's if its authentic or not  jólaköttur (yes) (got it wrong) definiteyly not the Swedish candy (got it wrong) trítlar (yes and got it right) obviously not the UK candy (got it wrong) stjörnurúlla (yes) (have no idea how he got it wrong when its sort of an classic) I have no idea, I don't think so because you say 'súkkulaði piparminta' tyrkisk peber is not Icelandic, its from Finland (yes and got it right) its obviously not Icelandic (and got it right) again, that's Swedish candy (and got it right) as much as I'd like to say its Icelandic, again, its Swedish (got it wrong) Maoam is German (and got it right) súpper sett (yes and got it right!) Ópal/Opal does originate from Iceland and is a classic! (and he got it right) peppermint/piparminta obviously doesn't originate from Iceland, though not sure if Nói Síríus made it so idk if its Icelandic or not Djöflar is icelandic, since well Freyja is an Icelandic candy brand (and yes its Icelandic) Lutti is actually French (and thank god Mark knew it) Risa Þristur is of course Icelandic (Mark got it right) skóla kridi is Icelandic (and somehow got it wrong) again, tyrkis peber is from Finland (and he got it right) Frisia is not Icelandic (and got it right) yes, lakkrís rör is Icelandic, and oh god my heart hurts from watching him drink from it (and yes thankfully he got it right) and I have no idea what the last candy's name is, though its not Icelandic (and yes he got it right)  so that's just what's in it, thought it would be fun to show non-Icelandic people if its Icelandic or not as an Icelander :D
26:36 lixian knew what he was doing with those subtitles
I’ve been to Iceland twice, beautiful country. The capital Reykjavík is literally famous for the amount of stray cats there. Unfortunately travel there might be a bit difficult because it’s being flooded by lava right now, and it will continue to be flooded by lava for the next 300 years  Also, does anyone know what jacket mark is wearing? That thing looks nice as hell
Man if mark starts a series of trying candies around the world (he did Canada and now Iceland), I would be so down to watch them all
I'm eating potato with ketchup while I watch mark review candies. Perfect.
As someone who loves licorice I really wants try the fancy chocolate covered licorice now
I feel like mark accidently went into a licorice store instead of a candy store
Mark is slowly turning into Johnny Depp.
38:41 the pain
I wonder if Mark's camera ever wonders why he talks to himself
Mark: “It could be Swedish, It could be Norwegian…” Me: A Dane waiting in excitement for Mark to mention Denmark. Mark: “…. Dutch” Me: ):
The " surprised asian man " look that Mark gives is so good.
big flex on the lenses mark
My gawd he really is adorable. 😂
hearing him try to pronounce these sounds a lot like a wizard casting a spell 6:47
Go back to Iceland and have Bjork be your tour guide. Make a whole vlog experience.
post apocalyptic pirate tries candy.
y'know, I just love that most of these are like, danish, swedish or German so fucking funny to me
Ofc, last one is the best one, Save the best for the last
0:19 epstien?
I loved the close-ups, and nice white hairs Mark- I was so surprised to see them tbh. Loved the vid by the way!
Scandinavian countries all have similar candies but super love their anise (black licorice)
“There’s no such thing as volcanoes” I’m about to turn into one
Mark at the beginning 🤞♾️🌌
A Markiplier Product Review? Last time I saw one of these it was self-defense weapons from Amazon.
Mark is slowly turning into Jack Sparrow
Is is just me or does Mark kinda look like an off brand Jack Sparrow?
Mark is slowly becoming the green ranger. Getting some serious Tommy Oliver vibes
The bubble dust is making me really want to enjoy one of those Hubba Bubba Bubble Jugs. God, that stopped making those things like 20 years ago, I think.
The whistle bit got me every time
The bubble dust stuff dug a weird memory out of my brain that I had no idea was there. I could immediately imagine licking that pile out of mark's hand.
Marks brain cells are at the cusp of erupting, like a volcano.
The first one just seemed like a 100 grand lol
Im so happy to see another review by you, i love these so much!
Ok but i wanna try the Franssons one he said was raspberry/licorice but I can't find it anywhere online 💀
I was gonna say fake video if there wasn't salmiakki and the very second candy is exactly what was necessary. Even if it's from sweden.
"Intentional ingestions of dilute ammonium chloride solutions can cause serious injury to the gastrointestinal tract and pulmonary systems"  Uhhhhhhhhhh
What kinda jacket my man wearing
Guys did you know that he doesn't love licorice but likes it instead?
I think that the MAOAM Pinballs are dutch, as I have been there, and you can also get them in many dutch stores.
I’ve had salty licorice from Denmark and it was really salty
I love reviews from you Mark. You should do more of this with videos
Man, the image quality on this is so crisp and clear! Must be some good lenses!
Liquorice
The sequel that we needed but took a while
When he asked “Do you know what this is?” (36:52) I said “That looks like only the white Good & Plenty” That was precisely what it was 😂
Lixian is a genius....the screaming falling candy made my day😂😂
Uh oh. He didn't thank Lixian...
“I don’t want this inside me anymore”
31:42 one bite of the devil's licorice turned Markiplier into Machete lol.
Welp I got new memes from this
What's up Icelandic with these salt and licorice candies 😅
Well, me interested is next Ukraine candy and drink 😎
For anyone else trapped in Mark's mind, know the way out of lens country?
I missed Mark and Lyxian❤❤
I'm so happy this is back! 🎉🎉❤❤😊
Melody pops are from SPAIN
I believe that’s Risa Thuristur, the þ is a symbol derived from the “thurs” fulthark if I recall. I don’t speak icelandic though so I am probably talking out my ass
That was just Bubble Jug...
This was awesome. Before starting this I was thinking "I bet there's gonna be a lot of salt and licorice" just because I've watched the Travel Man episode with Paul Rudd like 5 times. Would love LOVE love to see a candy review collab with an Irish man and a Dutch woman sometime. (Seán and Evelien) Just to get all the perspectives XD
What happened to Chica? 😢
Isn't Ammonium Chloride whats in smelling salts
The addition of the whistle jingle makes my inner child so happy 😊😊 it's like watching Mr Rogers or 90s PBS again ❤
God finally a review video. Love this so much.
Can any of our Icelandic friends tell me what flavors these are?
0:28 as a junior geologist we can confirm that volcanos are indeed, not exist
The Turkisk things are filled with hot salted licorice flavored powder......uh...uhm
13:45 the man who ate the hornets nest
What was that super salty candy i want to get some for experimentation and definitely not something for revenge
Am I the only one who thinks that he has a Jack Sparrow look going on lol
Me: Why so many intros in one video? Mark: Yup.. then is ME! a
9:04 I SAW THAT ON VAT19 😭🙏
I wanna know what brand that jacket is. I need it
YES I LOVE THESE TYPES OF VIDEOS! thank you for the many laughs:)
“Her new legs are growing in nicely.” 😭😭😭
mark looks like a korean jack sparrow rn
Spencer! What are you doing here?! Lol
I only liked this video because fuck it why not?
From bigthink  "Ammonium chloride is a slightly toxic chemical most notably found in "salmiak," a salt licorice candy, which is popular in northern Europe."
Is anyone going to talk about fact that 2/3 of his candy was licorice???
‏‪7:49‬‏ WAS THAT THE BITE OF 87
So when did Mark turn into Jack from Assassin's Creed: Black Flag...?
It's been year ago sense he made one of these
This video itself is an a salt
"enter my mind, there's no such thing as volcanos." "I think we should start over "  yup that sums up Marks mind Lmao
so they still got bubble jugs....neat
so what we’ve learned is that Iceland is obsessed with licorice and salt 😂
0:28 that unsure look that mark has after he says something questionable never gets old 😂
I’m assuming Mark delayed this video until now bc right when he recorded it, the volcanos in Iceland erupted lol
*Whistle transition*
I feel really bad laughing at the "Not my grandma! My grandma... is Korean." lmao
Long time since we had a video like this
Fifty minutes in the mind of markiplier
Such unnecessary description, just get to it
i doubt you will see this Mark but you should check out Svenskjavlar from haupt lakrits xD also the Djöflar or Devils is my favorite candy believe it or not
22:56 HAhAAHahaA; Ammonium Chloride, wikipedia, "The mineral is commonly formed on burning coal dumps" hahahahaha
press b to blow
Listen……. I need that jacket. I know it’s a g-star raw but does anyone know exactly what jacket that is?
Ammonium cloride is Salmiakki in Finland. It is a thing that gives you high blood preasure and people eat it by bags in here. The powder buck you hated: just salmiak .Turkish pebers, same stuff inside. I don’t like it and it can also be found in icecream. You can buy extra strong salmiak in pharmacies in here. And we made it in chemisty classes and ate it. Welcome to Finland, we are not ok here.
last time i ate liquerice i had a headache and threw up and ended up in the er bc the brand i got it from added alcohol and im allergic to alcohol
As a Canadian, when I first watched mark reacted to Tim Horton's food. I expected him to really enjoy the food because it's delicious. Clearly he didn't get it from a good Tim horton, because he hated almost everything. And now I'm wondering if he's not hating on something that someone out there in Iceland really loves and feels as angry as I felt back then.😂😂
tyrkish peber is containing hot lakritz XD
Me: *binging Mark's other candy/ thing reviews* Mark: *drops this video* Me: Woah- he read my mind.
I love he doesn't disrespect any by spitting it out
This is the best day.   Thanks for this video Mark, Lixian, Amy, Chica, Henry, and ...random doggo? Is that Ethan's dog?
The face zooms man...
It's candy coated licorice. I'm 100% sure because we have something similar looking in Germany. It's just thinner and colored but apart from that the way it's coated looks exactly the same. It's not too bad tho
Why is mark in a new area every 5 videos
What I learned while watching this video:  - Iceland only knows how to make liquorice candy  - Never to buy Icelandic candy
Why does Markiplier look like Che Guevara?
Mark! There is a new update in buckshot roulette!
I need more markiplier reviews
I am a little concerned for his heartrate.
I remember you’ve had a hard time donating food that’s already open,  So I suggest offering these items on “buy nothing” groups on social media! I often use Facebook for this, you can prevent waste like this!
i can’t look past his dirty finger nails and nose hairs 😭
Having researched some Icelandic folklore, him putting the candy with the Yule Cat on it in the "Not Icelandic" pile caused emotional pain. He really couldn't have known, but oof.
Will u play poppy playtime chapter 3
Mark became R2D2 for a minute with that melody pop
We had that Jerry can of gum in America. It was Hubba Bubba Bubble Jug.
15:04 there is a cocktail you can make with those candies. It’s finish its called salmiaki koshkinkorva. You shaman those candies with a hammer, dump it in a bottle of vodka, seal the bottle tightly and then toss it in your dishwasher and heave it run through a cycle. The heat from the dishwasher perfectly melts and mixes the salty licorice candies into the vodka, it’s salty but also pretty smooth. It got so popular in Finland, especially amongst the youth of the country that alcoholism went on the rise, to the point it was banned for a time.
Bro his mind is fire 🔥🔥🔥
Ah yes the birth of new thumbnail faces
Is anyone going to acknowledge that the camera quality is so good we can see every single pore on marks face
7:00 minutes in, it is looks like something out of amnesia
Ive had something similar looking to that last choc covered salted licorice from denmark and it was the best licorice I've ever had.
48:05 did mark just steal spencer orrr...?
so apparently ammonium chloride is NOT edible, and is toxic to the body....so i think you actually ate some hockey chalk. used to coat the puck..XD
Why was Ethan dog there?
22:12 When the Uber Eats driver gets hungry:
Ohm
Lmao mark plz I’m trying to workout.  “Anyone that doesn’t have 2 nipples is special and I love you”
The whistle will haunt my dreams.
I'd love to see Mark try other unique foods and candies. His reactions are great.
The screaming candy is making me cackle so hard
"Ammonium Chloride is an odorless, white powder. Solid Ammonium Chloride is used to make dry batteries and Ammonia compounds, as a soldering flux, a pickling agent in Zinc coating and tinning, and a fertilizer. Ammonium Chloride fume, a finely divided particle dispersed in air, is produced in galvanizing operations." Lol
I wonder how many burpees Alex is going to make Mark do for this video...
Babysitting pups❤️❤️
That powdered candy gum you can get in the US. I used to have gum like that in the 90s/early 2000s and then that specific brand is at Target and on Vat19
As someone who doesn’t have exactly 2 nipples… I love you too mark🫶🏻🥹😅
Why does mark give me so much "korean jack sparrow" vibes
rats
"plane, air, sky.... Tower"
I'm a bit lost, what happened to Chica and her legs? 🥺
i honest to god thought those squeezy tube bubblegums stopped being produced!! we used to have them in greece when i was growing up all the time, and can confirm, that's what the texture is supposed to be like. i imagine that chewing on a necromorph would yield the same sensation. i remember loving the flavor, though. it was some kind of ambiguous fruit gum goo.
OK, but why are you grinding salt directly into your hand and licking it straight from your palm?
You can't just talk about a haunted mask and then not show it! I tried looking it up too and didn't find anything! Why must you torture me this way mark Also chica! :D
I feel like this is the most authentic view of mark we get and I’m here for it. I think the only comparable is both mark and Ethan in Unus Annus
Aparently the only thing Iceland makes is Licorice 😂
the fact that he just bit into the liquorice roll instead of unrolling it a bit and eating it that way .. hurts me to my core and i feel betrayed 🥲
I am scared to see the day that lexian leaves mark and goes to do other projects
Love how we got a little bit of everything in this video: Mark going insane, multiple switching camera angles, Chica AND Henry AND SPENCER screen time, and even Amy commentary!
Where's matpat when you need him!?
Why dose he look like Caption jack Sparrow?
I'm so glad, your review videos are some of my favorites
the whistle thing is giving "harmonicandy"
Markiplier is this generations Jim Carrey.
"I dont know what you are, but youre not hot" 🤣🤣🤣😅😅
Please review more candy it's so funny!
Waiting for the day Mark tries Brazilian candy
As a scandinavian who loves the Tyrkisk Peber, the Hockey Pulver and the stickies that Mark said were way too salt, I can say, you haven't even tasted half of how salty some candy here can be. A while ago a friend of mine got some weird local salt licorice sticks, and they were so salty, I had to spit it out, because the taste of the salt was so intense, I was legitimately afraid it would actually fry some receptors in my brain by sheer overload. Not joking.
Make more of these vids
At the end, Mark thanked everyone but Lixian.  P.S. I loved the part where it said "happy Amy noises." it made me laugh.
I love these types of videos by you mark!!!You should make them more often !!!!
This is the most hilarious candy review video I’ve ever witnessed.
“Not the best but I’ll eat it” *proceeds to immediately gag*
31:42 🧂Mark's taste buds were asSALTed. 🤣
I'm ps Iceland is known as the "Land of the Cats"...?  But...  Maybe not.  Maybe that's a different place.    The new disgusted meme face. (You'll know when you see it.)    I LOVE liccorice.  Like, so much, that if someone gave me a bag of 'em, I'd marry them right on the spot.    It's just gummy rings but human. XD    Mark having to use his full man strength to open a struggling wrapper.    I've never had a slide whistle as a kid. :,)  But I had a flute.    I want the Pinballs. They sound yummerz yummers in my tummerz.    And the chocolate-covered liccorice balls.    Yum. 😋    Eat a UFO and a UFO will eat YOU. 😁👍    I can't believe he's gotten so far from FNAF videos in 2016.    Mr. Masochist Mark doesn't like something bad?  SOUND THE ALARMS
THE GREATEST REVIEW CHANNEL HAS RETURNED?!?
I've had the slide whistle candy before, as a kid in the 80s in the US.
who else glanced over the thumbnail thinking its a video from ages ago
Here’s what I found out about Ammonium Chloride:  Ammonium chloride is an inorganic chemical compound with the formula NH4Cl and a white crystalline salt that is highly soluble in water. Solutions of ammonium chloride are mildly acidic. In its naturally occurring mineralogic form, it is known as sal ammoniac. The mineral is commonly formed on burning coal dumps from condensation of coal-derived gases. It is also found around some types of volcanic vents. It is mainly used as fertilizer and a flavouring agent in some types of liquorice. It is the product from the reaction of hydrochloric acid and ammonia.  😳
Mark definitely woke up someone's ancestors with these pronunciations.
The powder gum is from the uk
I just realized, in this video mark is looking like he is dressed up as a pirate.  Maargh-kiplier.  Sorry.  Had to
Those little whistle things are sold at my campus here in the States! They can be so loud and high pitched and its hilarious. They were banned from football games after the first night of selling them.
You should try UK sweets if you ever wanna, while we have some of the best chocolate in the world we also have some of the genuinely worst sweets of any place I’ve ever tried, was raised with so many and they are still revolting, a lot of pastrie/tart based sweets, foam bananas and jaffa cake stick out as my personal most hated, favourite is terry chocolate orange and kipling viennese whirls although I know y’all have them up north in some places :))))  Edit: I just remembered a core memory sweet, it’s this red and white swirl sweet called creme savers, it’s the ultimate grandma sweet of the UK that shit banged so hard when I was a youngin
HELL YEAH
I’m not a sadist. But this video was the highlight of my week
the "hey stop stealing the show" but then proceed to put a camera just for them is peak pet owner move 🤣
I googled ammonium chloride while watching this, and it says it can cause intestinal distress if ingested. As Americans say, “do not ingest” that and Icelandic people are like “it’s just salt it’s OK!” 😟
Marks jokes about our attention span and proceeds to make a 49 min video
I love how Markiplier always does like four different intros and just leaves all of them in lol
I need someone to send me some Appelsín and Sambó Þristur
Ah Icelandic Jelly Babies
Your editor is hilarious and I love the dynamic. Great to see you guys again. 🫶🏻
Im still tryna leave mark's mind
yknow if mark ever comes to new zealand again he should definitely try RJ's licorice bullets. they have a factory store with buckets full of different licorice flavours (cherry blossom was my favourite) its also a lot cheaper than 50 bucks lol
I love these videos so much. Thanks for making my week.
At 31:41, of Mark trying that odd candy, I died laughing with his reaction, lmao. Love your videos, Mark, you always make me laugh and brighten my days. Thank you ❤
I wonder what it looks like to Amy when Mark is talking to Lixian.
Iceland=Licorice
Why he look like jack sparrow 😂
I love that crunch
Please make more of these vids, I love them so fucking much
I believe the thing is probably more salty licorice or a human soul
i think it's a little disappointing mark or his friends haven't said anything about the tragedies and war crimes committed against palestine..not anything?? when you have been supportive of so many other good causes? ceasefire now. free palestine.
Is Licorice.
I love Maoam so much. It comes in tons of different styles. I’m pretty sure it’s German?
I love that Mark paid for on this and hates it all
THE LITTLE JINGLE KILLS ME EVERYTIME PLSEAKSBDJDBD
I have to mention: on tumblr i learned that most pasta made in iceland is made in one factory, and they had an issue recently? Like, people couldnt get pasta there for a couple weeks, cuz there is only one manufacturer?
I love having Amy in the background! I missed having her in videos
*looks at Swedish flag*  “is that the Swedish flag?”  *puts it in Icelandic pile* So close yet so far…
Being from Finland, it brought me great joy seeing you suffer from Salmiakki lmaoo
Nobody: Mark, mere seconds into a video about candy: COME INTO MY MIND FOR A MINUTE AND WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT VOLCANOES AND AIRPLANES.
Mark will bite half the gummy then leave it and go to another... I love it🤣
The opening was like scripted level comedy and it’s just so much better that I know it was just Mark and Amy talking
Fun fact: heat ammonium chloride and it dissociates into ammonia gas and hydrochloric acid.  You can dissolve it in water, brush it on wood, and heat with a heat gun to make it look like you burned the wood, as if you used a branding iron or did pyrography.
mark as soon as he sees chica '' hey want some beer? ''
Lixian making the decimals Euro-style (using a comma instead of a period/full stop) made it just that extra bit non-American to really being it on home xD
10:15 Its less of standards and more of informed concent but I get what he's saying
The screaming noises are goat
I’ve always had a thing for the pirate aesthetic and rn Mark is looking like he could definitely give Jack Sparrow a run for his money
21:31 MARK CLEAN YOUR FINGERNAILS!!!
“There are no cats in Iceland.” -Markiplier  “There have been cats in Iceland since it was settled in 870.” -Google
When I think of what's inside Markipliers mind, I imagine him in an elevator with the "Space is so cool" song playing on repeat.
Darling the annual Mark ASMR came out come watch!
"Is this food" Why does the mimic remind me soooo much of jack Sparrow 😂
27:30 for some puppo just chillin
Mark... are you okay?
ISS THAT A SWEETISH FLAGGGGG?! Markiplier -2024
“I usually like the blues”-Markiplier 2024
now i wanna know what the volcano thing was gonna be...
Poor Mark, 😂 looks like he had fun hating most of the snacks 😂😂😂
14:40 I mean, in my country we got some banger mint & chocolate candies.
Jag kommer från Sverige och höra honom säg nordisk ord var så underhållande    Vi älskar du mark!
“Happy Amy noises”  We love Lixians’ attention to detail  43:43 We love a MatPat reference  We love everything about Mark, honestly
I sure have missed these review vids. Thanks mark!
i was waiting the whole video for mark to get some salmiakki 🤭
As someone who doesn't like licorice, this just taught me to never go to Iceland 🤣🥲
12:27 i feel like i'm  supposed to pick an option
It's been over a year. You're as beautiful as the day I lost you.
Look at mark here. Looking like asian jack sparrow.  I missed his "mariplier tries" series. I hope he does more. The way he explains things is funny
We used to have powdered gum jugs I think Hubba Bubba but this was like in 2000s. I do not remember the taste or even if I liked it haha
I liek candy
don't scratch your lenses with your way too long finger nails.
Say, licorice straws don't sound like a bad alternative to plastic straws. . .if you like licorice that is.
Tyrkisk peber got that good ammonium chloride inside.
Tyrkisk Peber is one hell of a strange candy.... It's Black licorice with Black pepper filling for the hot heat. It is a pure mind Kurfufle. I was gifted by my wife with a bag over Christmas... As well as Black Licorice fish gummys. I didn't know I could be black licoriced out. XD
45:48
Domain expansion: Mindiplier
Hey mark… those were mushrooms… not nipples..
man eats another man's weight in sodium every day no wonder he had a heart attack 😭
"From Fazer...." My mind immediately went to Fazer blast-
“*whistle* *whistle* *whistle* *candy appears*” ok
Toot sweet. ♪♫♪♫♪♫♪•
most of what he eats are actually danish, it's so sad to see my country be forgotten...
I don't understand how people can eat licorice.  It's terrible. Give me peanut butter cups all day.
Can you please play Phasmophobia.
My cat reacted to the whistle the melody candy drove her nuts
This wasn't actually real, we were just in Marks mind the whole time.
The chupachups melody pop is my childhood candy. I used to live in Georgia 🇬🇪 and those were sold at every store for like 25¢ so I had lots of them. I’m really glad mark enjoyed it 😂🤝
I've learned that if you want to eat icelandic sweets (candy) you need to love liquorice. I hate liquorice.
Day 7 of asking mark to notice me in any way pls
Imodium chloride is a base salt and helps with diarrhoea problems. Your welcome to anyone who is curious.
BABE WAKE UP NEW OLD STYLE MARKIPLIER VIDEO!!!
I love the whistle jingle between the candies; it enhanced the video in a way that was deeply hilarious. I hope Mark keeps that sample for future use.
why the fuck did i crack up EVERY SINGLE TIME the candy flute jingle went off? XD
Mark looks like a pirate
Don’t you just love chaotic Mark and amazing lixian’s edits…best dual
The sound effects with the candy flying on his lap is hilarious. 😂 25:05 27:28 39:12
When he said "not my grandma, my geanda is korean" my brain thought "dead"! Idk why
i just love watching mark reviewing stuff
Inscription part 13?
<joke>Oh man, have you guys heard about the 2024 Candy Massacres?  Man, I can't believe he'd post something so offensive.</joke>
31:01 I thought that was going to be the start of an ARG
Did I miss something? Why was he in Iceland?
As an American my first thought is "why is licorice in every damn candy?" And then I remember that we put ranch flavor in everything
Information on   (ammonium chloride)  Ammonium chloride is an inorganic chemical compound with the formula NH4Cl and a white crystalline salt that is highly soluble in water. Solutions of ammonium chloride are mildly acidic. In its naturally occurring mineralogic form, it is known as sal ammoniac. The mineral is commonly formed on burning coal dumps from condensation of coal-derived gases. It is also found around some types of volcanic vents. It is mainly used as fertilizer and a flavouring agent in some types of liquorice. It is the product from the reaction of hydrochloric acid and ammonia.
Ammonium chloride powder is what was inside of the "spicy candy" too and apparently it's used in fertilizer and other agricultural things lol
Mark is now on a sugar diet after this.
18:37 What the hell am I watching
Mark's hair look so great long.
The melody pop is actually Australian
A FOOOOOOD THEORY!!!
If my memory serves me right, I remember hubba Bubba gum also came in a container similar to the red one.
"Sober Sexier Captain Jack Sparrow Reviews Candy Of Mysterious Origins That Are Most Definitely Maybe From Iceland POV Way Deeper In His Mind Than Your Brain Could Possibly Comprehend" - the proper title of this video
This video turned my night around
I believe the salt stuff you’re not supposed to eat, you’re supposed to just like sniff it when you play a sport
Okay, genuinely asking, do people enjoy the taste of beer?  I'm 21, and it always tastes like carbonated pee. (Don't ask)
Mark you're looking more and more like a pirate lately
I'm really loving marks will turner pirate look
What’s the song at 41:42?
Oh god. Mark is eating something. Get ready for the hospital post.
I have the green apple version of the powdered gum
Ammonium chloride was in my hairdye today I think 😨😰
Petition for the jingle to be used in future videos
Was mark playing daisy on the whistle
an Icelandic person is watching these just face palming so hard😆
Captain Mark Sparrow, reporting for goofiness.
25:05 on repeat while I cackle in bed.
my biggest flex is going to iceland
They use alot of salt right? I remember hearing they have salt coated candy
The jingle made me so happy once it became a thing.
Dog sneaking from behind at 19:05.
if your actually Icelandic, you would like the candy way more like Djöfflar, Þristur, Trítlar
Ammonium chloride from the hockey puck is an odorless white power but it looks like the whole candy was ammonium chloride but it’s used to make dry batteries
The music really remind me of smash or pass
Hjärtligt gott från Gränna- Heartly good (as in "something tasting good") from Gränna (A place). I honestly cant think of a good translation. Sweet sweets from Gränna? Warm tasty stuff from Gränna?
21:39 as someone with no nipples, I appreciate it
I want to see Mark testing other YouTubers products. Including makeup. I bet he'd love Oompa's Sour Boys candy.
Not me being over here liking like 97% of those -
Sorry to be a geo nerd but Iceland is an island, no bordering countries 💀
So youd rather make these kind of videos than actually finish a lets play series? Come on man all that money and time. Might as well make separate accounts. Cuz youre letting more people down than you think. Ig thats what happens when you escape the rat race huh. All that pent up frustration of having to keep up that persona.
I love Mark and Amy shenanigans you both make me laugh so much! That salty candy I wanna try it because I do eat salt like crazy.
i just got three minutes in and checked the time and i’ve never been happier to see that a video is 50 minutes long
As someone with Swedish roots, Hockey Pulver is actually from Sweden :) though Mark didn't eat it properly, you are supposed to dip your tongue in it. It's also licorice powder with ammonium chloride.
The licorice episode
The whistle candy...       Man that brought back memories.
Me, whose never seen a Melody Pop in Malaysia since 1990: Wait, they still make those?
I'm a fan of the Candy flute jingle and I'm sad I won't hear it after this
Lixian is amazing!
Hey Mark, I've been using an old clip of you with a pink mustache shouting "JUMPCUT" (from one of your Eleusis videos) as one of my scene transitions in my videos (that and those Spongebob scene transitions). You don't mind, do you?
About 66.6% of this is mark chewing asmr
What game is this?
Alright, there was a delicious gum that came out of a canister and I'm pretty sure they were heart shaped and they sold it at Kmart. I distinctly remember this gum, it was like big League chew
Reminds me of his Dry Ice Popsicle challenge. How long aho was that?
Markipliers review career is back bady!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sponser this man!
The last candy is on Amazon...  Never liked straight licorice, however.....  *hovers finger over buy button*
19:48 Why does this sound like Hatsune Miku?
The number one review channel on YouTube is back again
you gotta play "the pony factory" from that David Szymanski guy, the one who also made Squirrel stapler
It's a good thing Chica just came from the dentist, cause dogs shouldn't eat licorice anyway
What did mark mean by "her new legs"? Did something happen to chica or is he just being funny?
I love that he left the volcano part in there. After listening to distractable and having him explain the start of this video, I was really hoping he would leave it in. And he did! 😂good call Amy
this is what came to my mind  "plane, air, sky, coming to two towers ".
Did you shoot this on the RED camera with those $100k minolta lenses? Lmao because those macro shots are insane.
you need to suck on the whistle lollipop first so the hole gets cleared and it gets unbelievably loud
I love it when mark makes these kinds of videos
The candy I miss the most are shock tarts.. I loved those growing up
mark are you balding why are you wearing that its been months
Maybe the flames aren’t meant to indicate that the substance inside the Turkish Pepper (Tyrgisk Peber, was it?) is spicy; maybe it’s a warning that it is an accelerant?
Ford is "proudly made in America," but 95% of its parts are made in China.
I'm from iceland and I can say this checks out. Or as we like to say scruuten.
0:22 a volcano actually erupted in Iceland 😰
GD he looks like the next Jack Sparrow lol
The original colonizers of Iceland named it Iceland to discourage people from settling there.  The original colonizers of Greenland named it Greenland to encourage people to settle there.
Nice to see Mark putting all his camera lenses to work
so much licorice...
46:10   Licorice?
Amy's directorialship.....Directorship.....Amy's director-abilities with Mark's vision made me laugh immediately.
Finally another video that isn’t lethal company or help wanted 😂
Why is Spencer there I don’t understand but okay he’s cute Ethan isn’t a good dog dad I get it..
I don’t know if I am worried or excited
Since Mark eats takis like a mad man I'm sure he also chews jolly ranchers
Mark non gaming videos are a godsend.
Yeah the bubble jug is not a icelandic thing. Come to the eastcoast theyve always been a big thing
S++ tier intro
"I'm more mature than I look' Uh, no. No you're not, Mark.
nice bro
is that ethan's dog?
💜💜💜 I love you man lol
I remember the whistle candy from when I was a kid. Grew up in Ohio, definitely not Iceland.
Markiplier Reviews: Licorice
this is just a liquorish review at this point
I hve good news its not blue licorice got me dying 😂😂
The Turkish pepper is Finnish candy! And it's very popular in Finland. Fazer overall is Finnish company. 😊
Went back in 2022. I learned that a lot of products that are not from Iceland are British. That said they have a lot of uniques things mostly based around their “black licorice” (there’s a name that escapes me). A lot of unique food too, including skyr. Was a fun experience…  Wait, does that mean Markiplier went to the blue lagoon or was it during the -redacted- activity?
hey mark please get some rest  your starting to get dark bags uder your eyes... much love
Mark, maybe the TSA/postal service opened your liquid gum to check it?
Completely forgot chica lost her leg privileges
Mark, if you loved the first one (definitely not Icelandic) it's basically a Cadbury Picnic bar which is mainstream in UK/Australia and can be found locally in some regions of the USA/Canada or ordered online basically everywhere from UK/Australia-themed food sites. Different countries may or may not also include raisins, the Wikipedia entry details which ones.
31:48 mark: WATHEFUK
19:08 dude "toot-sweets" are real. Chitty-Chitty Bang-Bang kids RISE UP
37:05    Licorice
the camera quality's much better than my eyes
Wow, Markiplier has transformed into a pirate. Last time, I saw him, he had a father type character. Now, he has officially become a captain of the sea.
Not sure if the first candy is swedish but I do know it is pretty easy to find in swedish stores
Wait Mark went to Iceland Ahh that's awesome
I love them filming together 😂❤ but also, after him saying that one candy is the saltiest thing he's ever tasted, I want to see his reaction to Surströmming. I've seen people try it and say how salty it is
We've had that Jerry can full of powder gum since the 90's. Hubba Bubba made it. Look up Bubble Jug!
Due to generations of embargos Iceland only had licorice and had to get creative.
U should defintely try candy from Argentina
Why’s spencer there?
mark we need more West of loathing please.. thank you.
That intro was perfect.
var það bara ég sem fór í sjokk þegar eg sá titleinn á videoinu?😅
The Melody pop turning into a transition sound killed me 😂
Bon Appétit, you forgot to say!
Mark making the stank face like he's ripping an incredible trumpet solo
1:33 Darkiplier came out a but there
Can anyone explain why and how celebrities/popular people/models/artists/musicians always end up going to the same location throughout the year? Like, japan, france, now iceland? What is happening?? Im curious if its like a paid vacation/worktrip of some sort!
Had me dying at "There's no such thing as volcanoes"
oh mark, you make me laugh like the gremlin i am lol
Shave your nose, Mark
I absolutely despise licorice, I would never be able to survive Icelandic candy, I would absolutely rip my own face off out of disgust
Bro the jingle is killing me, I can't 🤣
the word "retire" coming out of Marks mouth in any context gives me heart palpitations now
i love the amy commentary, the back and forth and the sass... oh ive missed thier interactions
My POTs havin ass would LOVE the Hockey Pulver stuff if it's actually salt based and not... Salt flavored 😂
They really like licorice
would it be amazing to see Mark try one candy from every country around the world? 🤔
YESSSSS I LOVE THESE VIDEOS ITS BREN TOO LONG
The one thing we learned is the Icelanders like licorice more than anyone else in the world.
Why and when was Mark in Iceland? Also where was he when he filmed this?
Yes, I do know what that is. It's licorice. They literally look like "Good 'N Plenty"
Spencer cameo!!! <3
I hope lixian continues to put the whistle in future videos. Total gold
The whistle drove my cat crazy lmao
the little gummy people are like gummy shark equivalents but more terrifying because they look like they know something i don’t
I give the salty demon candy a 8.9/10  I love extreme flavors that make you regret your life decisions and/or go back to it again, and that description was mouth watering to me
food
I just want to see Amy's reaction to the candy now
sick vid man love it
licorice
Dietitians: Intentional ingestions of dilute ammonium chloride solutions can cause serious injury to the gastrointestinal tract and pulmonary systems, which can result in a complicated and prolonged hospitalization.  Icelandic Hockey Candy: How about I put it in anyway?
I love Iceland, even just being in the airport in Keflavík on the way to somewhere else is awesome. Reykjavík and Akureyri are lovely towns, the folk are friendly (enough, very quiet and withdrawn tho) and highly appreciate if you speak the tongue, the food is damn tasty, and the snacks and candy are phenomenal.  Ég sakna Íslands kærlega
Market Tire drinks beer guys omg
Mark playing the whistle had my dog VERY interested
I had so much fun watching this as someone who works in a European Import Market. 😂 As soon as Mark said he had no idea what that taste was I was like "it has to be Salmiak/Ammonium Chloride" Definitely an acquired taste.
ALL copies not authentic and bad ones at that  10:10 what American food safety standards are them? All food companies are allowed to add any ingredients they choose without permission interference oversights and are allowed to change said ingredient and loe to you tgat the ingredients you've consumed do not damage your brain cause cancers and affect your fertility that's already been proven to be true
Mark you need a manicure
7:17  IDK is true they tell dark tales so the children wont go outside at night for there safety
It’s ok I don’t know all my flags either
17:02 39:10 perhaps wasabi?
Please clean under your fingernails
My cat was NOT a fan of the slide whistle segment haha
Let me just send this to my online friend from Iceland. Why did I just know he was gonna say just a theory
When that little tune started between the candies I smiled every time I heard it
This video should've been called "Mark Tries Licorice In Many... *Many* different forms"
When i saw his face at  around 31:40 the first thing i thought was "is it salt licorice? I bet its salt licorice"
Been missing these vids
I need more Chica and Henry content, they're too cute!
“So we heard you like salt? Well here is some salt, in the salt, on the salt, coating your salt.” Should be the slogan of THAT candy.  Ive had it, and yes, i agree, dang near burnt out the taste buds its so salty
I’m still waiting for the toothpaste review
Man Idk if Mark's calling these candies Iceland when there's a swedish flag on one and another said UK
Yum
That gummy man jump scare scared me more than it should've
MARKIPLIER REVIEWS IS BACK. YOUTUBE HAS RISEN. MILLIONS MUST WATCH
Why does he look like a pirate
Love you to mark 😂 and we are all special in our own little ways 😂
can you make a video where you vlog at golden state fur con
'In mind with Markiplier'
Me: is horrified.  Yay comfy Markiplier video   Oh nvm he put mild horror vibes into a comfy video I'll put it off til next i remember it exists
"I feel like the package is Local" *Package doesn't open* Where I'm from, packages are like steel. Nobody knows why but it's so irritating 😂
man i wanna try that super salty candy
sudden spencer appearence
31:41 Forgot to take his hourly polyjuice potion...
The jingle is actually pretty good
49:18 Spencer !!!! ❤🥰❤️
Mark is in his jack sparrow phase rn and I love it
Why is that whistle tune so catchy? Definitely needs to be used for some fan game thing
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR ANOTHER MARKIPLIER REVIEWS
27:15  Blerhg  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!  31:45  so hilarious how mark gets so suprised and repeats "what the fuck"
Omg Melody Pops!! I totally forgot about those!! Now I want one!!
I’ve missed Amy😭😭♥️  Edit: the random Spencer at the end 😂😂
Iceland foreverrr!
Jólaköttur is Icelandic, it’s named after an urban legend ( a gigantic “Christmas cat”) that eats children who didn’t get clothes for christmas
As a Swede, Mark struggling and miserably (but stylishly) failing to read our impössible säntences was a joy to watch!
can a person from Iceland confirm the piles
I was just thinking like 2 days ago about how I kinda missed these types of videos. Thank you for reading my mind and making this video for me and me alone. My own thoughts 2 days ago brought this into existence and everyone is welcome for that. Sorry for anyone who believed in volcanoes though. Skissue
Hay mark do you think you developed high levels of schizophrenia by talking to a fake lexian almost every episode
Mark: "Everyone who doesn't have EXACTLY 2 nipples😡      You're special❤ and I love you.🥰"    Me: "I wasn't expecting I'd get love from Markiplier just because I have a third underdeveloped nipple today💀........but I love you, too, buddy.😂❤️"   Edit: Oh, bro...the painful sounds from Amy.😭 My girl, are you ok?! I love you, girl. ❤
I remember having that bubble dust-like gum as a kid! In America! I think ours were produced by the same people who made bubble tape OR Hubba Bubba and the jerrycan was pink, but we definitely had that in America!
more raft videos please
38:27 XD
Very chaotic candy review. We're here for it.
Yes
just watching mark try to pronounce these names is the best thing i'v seen all day lol
I'm just baffled by the fact Mark is just finding out about gum powder. We had the Hubba Bubba version in the '90's. 😵
Not going to lie when he said that his grandma was Korean. I said and my grandma is dead..
I’ve never thought about how strange it must be from Amy’s perspective whenever Mark talks to Lixian
Lixian really enjoyed editing this one! I loved it!
Mark can I just say I'm very proud of the amount of chewing present in this video. It really looks like your experiencing the food to an acceptable level.
I love you mark but someone needs to update frequently your playlist section! I took a break not even for 8 months and came back, and feel like an atheist during a major sermon balls deep in a story I know nothing about and can’t even figure out where to begin !
The little whistle music to transition to the different candies just reminded me of puppycat
I think the licorice straw would be good for waste
Mark lookin like POC3 Will Turner and I am HERE FOR ITTTTT 🥵
Mark confusing 'Danish' with 'Dutch' is painful when he's called out other people for the same mistake before
please go visit like the border of mexico so i can make you eat lucas powder and Pelon Pelo Rico :D
Ok but the camera work is incredibly cinematic here. Big big kudos to whatever happened there. And Lixian. And I love when Amy is involved in the videos, please more Amy if she wants to be part of it because yes.
If this was done before the Þorbjörn eruption can we say Mark is to blame?
Didn’t the volcano literally erupt? Lmao.
Salted Licorice
Oh hi Spencer
The Dutch are from the Netherlands. You know— weed cafes, windmills, wooden shoes? You were thinking of DANISH—I.e., from Denmark. Y’know… great seafarers, fishermen, blood axes, great burly blokes with blond hair who smoke strong pipe tobacco, *Hamlet*, Lars Ulrich?
Yayyy review video! I hate licorice but I would try those last ones, they seem better than typical licorice
This was neat 😊
It's probably already been mentioned, but Jolakattur, if I'm not mistaken, might be named after the Icelandic legend of the Yule Cat (which I think is what the name translates to)
The jerrycan is an American candy. When you start losing flavor you pour more into your mouth.
Did you film this with your new lenses?Because shit looks beautiful!!
6:27 - 6:41 when my cat begs for food and gets it at 3 AM
been waiting for this one since it was brought up in the podcast. glad to see you kept some of the volcano things in anyways i was really hoping to see em <3
Imagine if there was a volcano candy, Mark would burn his interiors so hard 💀
Play pal world
I am literally dying while watching this.. the little screams.... and the flavor reactions... 🤣😂🤣😂 Lmfao
Congratulations Mark, you found a way to use all your lenses, make me dizzy and yet I cannot turn away from the overkill. It's fun, but it lost me switching cameras so much. 👎🏼
Mark, you think Alex will punish you for eating candy like last time? ; )
35:29 Markiplier, Þ is pronounced as 'th' and the back in the ages, people used it in the English language until French and Italian immigrants came in as writers and got 'confused', so they change it to 'th', we should bring back Þ though.
There's a swedish flag on the front. Mark ''IM PRETTY SURE THIS IS AUTHENTIC ICELAND CANDY'' Those chocolate balls are from Bornholm in Denmark Tyrkisk Peber is some of the worst Danish candy ever which is apparently sold in Iceland and if we learned anything from this video, it's that kids from Iceland/Scandinavia work out when they open up that candy
But can we talk about the amazing camera quality! Never did ever think I would love seeing a bag of candy in 4k
I think the 'HOCKEY PULVER' maybe a cleaning product and not for human consumption?
I just love how much of a texture eater he is cuz same markie moo sameeee😅😅😅
Lixian is crazy at editing
The small shock that I got from seeing this on my main page is unexplainable, Mark trying something from little Iceland 🥹
Are the people of Iceland ok? Licorice is a laxative...
The way Mark stares into my Soul is just.....The best
Áhugavert
Man we had that gum in the US in the early 2000s, I think it was called bubble jug. I loved it.
As a Swede and being used to some of this candy, seeing the "Hockey Pulver" appear i immedietly knew what his reaction was going to be lol. We are fond of our super sour candy
gotta love that raw markiplier vibe
i think mark is turning to a pirate with the headband
THE FUCKIN MELODY POP Lord i forgot those existed 😂 for reference im in the US specifically Michigan and we used to get those all the time 😅 i had no idea they were an international or nordic candy????
I wanna see mark play pal world video or live stream
IVE HAD THE NIPPLES BEFOREEEE IDK HOW CUZ IM FROM THE US AND THIS WAS LIKE 2012
amy is the backbone of this channel thank you amy
As an icelandic person you don't get many chances to get your culture misrepresented, so I want to thank Mark for giving us that opertunity
As an Icelander who owns three cats I shall take it upon myself to correct Mark and say, we do indeed have cats. The cat on the candy bar is the Christmas cat. Also HOW did I NOT know Mark was in Iceland.
the second candy he had was swedish as you can tell by the yellow cross with blue
The tyrkisk peber candy has a salmiac center. Which is apparently PURE ammonium chloride.
I don't know if Mark the guy who will just drink hot sauce can tell of something is hot or not lol
how many did did you get right
It’s been a while since a reviews video…
I like that the second best thing is German candy
Anybody know what the expensive licorice from the ending is called or how to get it? kinda wanna try it
Wait. What happened to Chica's legs???
Mark that is not a P that is a thorn and it's pronounced th it's the same letter that we used to use in English for TH funny story The reason we say ye old shop and not the old shop is because the y replaces the thorn because typesetters did not have thorn characters  it really is the old shop not ye old shop it's just using the wrong letter and that letter is what you mistook for a p
mark needs to try danish candy most of the candy he did not like was from denmark🤣😂
absolutely love licorice and sometimes like the salty addition so i'll definitely have to visit Iceland, HOWEVER can someone give me context as to why the gang is all in Iceland?
The amount of times Licorice was said in this video makes it not even sound like a word anymore
Ever eat something so salty that not only does it not taste like salt but taste like how a burning sensation feels?
My best friend has 3 nipples…
doggo's !
Mark could easily play Jack Sparrow
I absolutely love these reviews, I was kind of surprised to see the "whistle lollypop" and the sour UFOs - loved it as a child and never realised it might be Icelandic. I hope that one day Mark will review Czech sweets 🥹
"Cuz kinda like airheads they over sell the spice* -Mark 2024
That "Sneaky Stardust" gum in the jerry can looks to be the same exact thing as "Bubble Jug" in the U.S.
Dude, the "California Hippie" persona is no excuse for those nails
During the swirl one I was waiting for an option to pick if it was Icelandic or not💀😂 Marks conditioned us to choose your own story😂
and Mark for your next candy review can you please try some Danish candy i assure you will love it
oh spencer is having a play date!
Deep dive into the markimind
Why does mark look like a modern pirate?
Lixian playing that flute melody throughout the rest of the video fucking KILLS ME 😭😭😭🤣
You’re so Portuguese
Mark just to inform you and i am happy to say this but the tyrkisk peber is Danish so you got something right
I love how he said "But hey! It's just a theory, a food theory!"
43:45 That aged like licorice milk
19:06 is that chica checking on what’s going on?
Mark: "I'm not a masochist." Also Mark: "I'm reviewing Icelandic candy."
I see Disney went with a Korean Jack Sparrow for the Pirates Of The Carrabien reboot.
They had those whistle pops in Japan when I lived there, I was obsessed with em haha
Why he look like he just came back from an audition for Captain Jack Sparrow?
He looks like solid snake with that bandanna
ah yes, american food safety standards. definitely better and safer than european standards.
That first one just looks like a 100 grand bar
mark….. have you never had bubble jug?
This whole review is like…..” is it licorice?”
Pinballs Maoam are from germany. german candys are deff one of the best in the whole world. atleast top 10
Someone needs to remix that Melody Pop melody he made! 😂
Not me making the same faces Mark does, as he does, for absolutely no damn reason.
Damn, Orlando Bloom looking fine 👌
i remember seeing a tumble post about a dream someone had about seeing these tall humanoids in the woods with long fur, branching antlers, and screens on their chests that flashed static and incomprehensible images, and realizing that they were adult teletubbies.  anyway those Trítlar guys look like adult sour patch kids in a similar way.
These are my favorite type of videos Oh, and for those who don't know, liquorice is an aphrodisiac soooo yea 😅
I always enjoy seeing your videos. I love it.
He spent like a solid minute deciding whether or not the candy "Turkish  Pepper" was not Icelandic.
Has Mark never had a 100 grand bar? Because that first candy is just a 100 grand bar
9:15 we have the exact same "gum powder" in a jerry can in the UK 😅
Who else loved it when mark did the food theory outro
Am I the only one who got heavily distracted by Ethan and Spencer? I saw Spencer and got really invested trying to figure out if Ethan was there.  Other than that very entertaining 50 minute video of Mark eating candy LOL
You should do the one salty chip challenge since you like salt lol.
The excitement over the melody pop thingy is awesome lol then the look on his face when he blew hard enough to make it work lol Mark being Mark is why we live him lol
4:40 I thought he was gonna say my grandma is dead 😂
Is this video just so Mark can show off his new lenses?
That first candy you tried in America the equivalent would be 100 grand
I missed these 🎉
My name is Melody I love that whistle
I want a full episode of just Mark playing the Melody candy
Mark I looked it up and Amonium chloride IS NOT safe to eat. In fact this stuff is so piosonus to you It can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Yeah not fun don't recemend it
Lixian is the greatest
Moam pinballs are delicious love em they are the best combining flavors is even better tho.
All I want after seeing his reaction to the gummy people sweets, is for Mark to come across the treasure that is Jelly Babies.
Im from iceland and the first one is icelandic and the second is from sweeden
You should totally review Sour Boys by Oompaville.
Those "nipples" are foam mushrooms lol we have them here in the Uk not sure what flavor he had here but the strawberry ones are delicious
What's with all the licorice geez
there's no such thing as volcanoes- best quote of 2024
I am still trapped in Mark's mind. I can't find the way out, help me.
The whistle sucker reminded me of a toot sweet from Chitty Chitty bang bang! THERE REAL!!! YAY!
20:06 THE CLANKERS SOUND
That chocolate bar in the beginning is literally just a 100 grand bar
44:46 Icelandic turtle snack
take off the bandana
Hey Mark I wanted to leave a little message I’m a 59 year old grandmother and my 15 year old granddaughter we watch your videos together. We have jump scares and we laugh a lot. It’s not typical subscriber but we wanted you to know. How was that salty licorice 😂
"im willing to say that this is authentic"  he says while holding candy with a swedish flag
i love the whistle pop ive had one as a child and i never got one since then cause of how annoying i was around my parents and also cause i couldnt find them after but they dont taste the best but they also have a fun facator witch moast candy doesnt have normally*
MARKIPLIER WHEN WILL THE IRON LUNG MOVIE IS COMING OUT?
"Mark had a fantasy about having a fantasy about having a fantasy about eating Icelandic candy (gone disturbingly sexual for the topic at hand)"
not henry checking on mark around 19:06💀
4:35 for a second I thought he was gonna say “my grandma is dead”
What will Amy’s man baby review next
Totally thought he was gonna Beavo that first candy
"I don't know what's going on"-Amy and everyone else in 2024. XD
Please come back to fnaf 1-6
22:29 the sound of pure agony
Need more Amy and puppies
The bubble gum in the tube is an old concept. I used to get that in the 80’s in middle school. You squeeze it in your mouth obviously and chew real Fast and it becomes regular gum. The Melody pop is old too, it was my favorite is as a kid. The wrapper has a song to play.
why do they have Spencer?
Mark trying to pronounce the names of the candy 😂😂😂😂
i found that bubble dust at my local giant eagle....in ohio
licorice is no longer a word
I really want him to do try not to laugh again it's been 2 years and also to continue playing sons of the forest
mark trying to make an intro gives me “i buried a body in iceland, but also bought some candy” vibes😭🤣
That ”liquid gum” used to be my favourite as a kid. I know from firsthand experience that the watery-looking goo that first came out of the tube shows that it’s completely new. 😂 I’m so bummed he didn’t try it 😭
THIS WILL HELP EM SOME MUCH I'M DOING A PROJECT FOR HISTORY ON ICELAND!!!
THAT WAS LIKE 5 DIFFERENT INTROS BACK TO BACK LMAO
You tease me with the picture of a haunted mask and then don't even put it up.  I feel betrayed
I go to Iceland from time to time but some of these candys i have never seen before I'm amazed how Mark even found these
Ok seeing Spencer at the end there really made me wanna see Ethan try the candies too
Sick with a bacterial infection and this is just what I needed!!
I really want Markiplier to try the world's saltiest candy which is from Sweden I think... I could be wrong though. IDK, I'm not from there, I just have seen other reactions to that candy before.
Like this if you think mark should do a video testing dog products so we can see the puppers.❤️
Mark!! If you are craving salt (which that what it sounds like) you might be low on iodine!! Iodine is an essential mineral which is not found in a lot of things. It is added to salt so we can get enough iodine. You probably will never see this but on the off chance you do, maybe look into that. And to anyone else who craves salt to the point where you will pore salt in your hand to lick it off, you might be low on iodine.
49 minutes and 41 seconds of mouth sounds
the first one looks like a candy called "Chokito", i have eaten this candy for like, my whole childhood
ICELAND METITIONED
There are no volcanoes in Ba Sing Se
So... now I'm wondering when Mark will try Turkish products.
Mark, when are you going to play fears to fathom ironbark lookout?
Mark referencing matpat is heartwarming
I actually want a pack of those super salty candies
Markiplier's theory on the creation of the bubble gum seems to be pretty smart.
Mark: idk the Swedish flag Pewds: Am i a joke to you?
31:18 I assure you, Iceland has a LOT of cats. There are stray cats all over the place in the capital city Reykjavík.
If you want to try swiss candy i could send you a box mark
i love how salmiak (the ammonium chloride) has both mark and amy so bewildered. i feel the same way and i'm sorry about the tyrkisk peber
This was 50 minutes ??? It felt like 20 omg, love all the cotent you make
Lol the fire editing is awesome
If Mark played that slide whistle candy for too much longer he might've accidentally summoned Enya
im really suprised honestly to see this on my youtube i like to watch you play horror games also im from iceland and most candy here is good also i missed you in iceland  ;c
Why does Mark look like a pirate?
I'm here for Mark's pirate arc with that bandana.
From 2018 to 2020, a total of six patients were treated in intensive care due to licorice toxicity (table). All showed the symptom triad of arterial hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Subjective symptoms were muscle weakness, muscle pain, paresis (including tetraparesis), and palpitations...  Mark may be #7.
Hraum is my favorite of all kinds of candy
iceland
9:00 I recently moved to a new city in Canada, and we have this candy at 9:00. For us, it’s called sneaky stardust.
my sims: 31:40
4:41  "Korean" was not the word i thought he was gonna use to describe his grandma 💀😭
I love all the face close ups
i  cant  believe  markiplier  confessed  his  love  to  harry  styles  :O
mark sparrow
BABE WAKE UP NEW MARKIPLIER REVIEW VIDEO JUST DROPPED
iceland really does love licorice
that whistle sounds like that vocoloid voice, or the voice of puppycat
Is that Spencer??? ❤
I have been watching this channel for many years, and I DON'T remember them saying anything about Chica needing her legs fixed or anything. WHAT DID I MISS GUYS?!!!!!!
“There’s no such things as volcanoes” Tom Scott would like to introduce to you Icelandic Mexican fusion cuisine.
Do you reckon they had that cough sweet stuff inside and where just cough sweets 39:00
I’m in your volcano, Icelandic people. Watch out
I work at a Claire's in the US and we sell that gum powder. Not Icelandic haha
Not even a minute in video's already gold!
Things I learned about iceland today: All their candy contains either licorice or salt. Lots of licorice. Lots of salt.
Usually, if a candy has a chemical flavor or ingredients, it's from the US. Candy from other countries have a purer taste.
He look like Matt Stonie now.
Real Icelandic licorice is soooo good tho, they and the Finns know how to do it right
YASS I LOVE WHEN MARK TRIES CANDY
1:33 Your Darkiplier is showing again
Tyrkisk peber is the god of all candy. Nothing is as delishious as tyrkisk peber!
I've had some of these candies before, like the bubblegum dust and the whistle candy, and I'm from Texas, so some of these must be international at the very least.
I love how Lexian is left to do everything for mark
ammonium chloride… sounds like al chemistry ionized salt
Captain Mark Sparrow
Why does Mark look like a Pirate?
Licerish
What monster CHEWS on hard candy?! I almost cringed and grimaced out of my chair 🤢
ammonium is a metal
Markiplier should review protein bars
Man, I really missed these kinds of videos
Markiplier reminds me of willy wonka, for some reason
mark don't you even joke about retiring...we just lost matpat it's too soon
It's so funny how many people just can't handle salmiak 😂
Socker=sugar
aww it'S SPENCER ;D
Why is there so much licorice? 😂
How did they make something saltier than salt?
anyone else curious why mark has spencer? Is he just baby sitting him
We got a Spencer cameo! Loved seeing Henrys little face poke out at the slide whistle haha.
you were almost 100% with what was and wasn't icelandic
wait Mark have you seen the little tins of shredded jerky that just looks like tobacco chew, I got some and use pretend it was chew infront of my friends, get a thumb and pointer finger full and shove it down between my teeth and gum
Let's gooo
And also one more thing, my brother loves you😊😊❤🎉 he has the Meta quest 3 to He really loves you😊
43:57 you know what you also had mark? A sink. With water
Poor Mark missed out on all the actually good icelandic candy by buying all this from some expensive store in iceland like Samkaup, Nettó or Iceland 😢 Buff, Æði etc totally left out and the whole point of the lakkrísrör is that when you finish your drink its heavenly
0:20  How would that be MARKIPLIERS' fault
Want to know what this was super funny to watch as an active liquorice enjoyer
anyone else wanna see mark play voidtrain again
I love Lixian's editing so much! The yell when Mark drops something 🤣
And Markiplier, you should try MrBeast chocolate bar it’s so good please try it😊😊🎉❤❤🎉🎉
The best food review channel fr
“Solid Ammonium Chloride is used to make dry batteries and Ammonia compounds, as a soldering flux, a pickling agent in Zinc coating and tinning, and a fertilizer.”
Bro OD'ed on licorice 😂😂
I read I review Icelandic comedy
These videos make me anxious cuz i'll be scared that mark gonna wind up in the hospital
That liquorice straw was just old 😂 they're usually softer
2 towers
Last one looked like carp fishing boilis bait 😂
Pretty cool that my school has a painting of you with your red hair and its been there for years
I think a candy shop where Licorice is banished would do well in Iceland. xD
Hi welcome!
Did he say airheads were spicy lmao
the frog eyes for the spicy candy
Hearing Amy in a video behind the camera is like going to visit an old friend that you haven't seen in a while but you don't actually do much but chill for a while and then leave. I should probably go outside more.
As someone who has lived in Finland for their entire life it’s extremely amusing to watch mark perplexed at each and every Nordic candy (except for the mint)
Watching the light die in Mark's eyes so many times was hilarious
I'm not a huge fan of licorice but I would still try all these candies. They look interesting and Mark's reactions are great 😂
Wow, after hearing about this first on Distractible, I've been anticipating this volcano warning 😂
And now we observe a markiplier on the hunt for food
:D ANOTHER EPISODE OF MARKIPLIER FOOD REVIEWS WOOOO
5:00 Mark is just youtube version of Jack Sparrow
18:57 pause. LMAO
Amy, keep ruining Mark's bits. It's a great thing to do!
the way mark talks about how he consumes salt.... might have low blood pressure or or POTS? or maybe PICA?? is that the one where people are low on minerals so they eat dirt?
What we've learned from this video: Markiplier hates salmiak 😂
*me realising I now know intimately what it sounds like when Markiplier chews and swallows* …*me not knowing what to do with this information*
Ending with the Danish Lakrids by Bülow, a fine choice may I say. Although, I wish you got more packs, cuz they have some great flavours!
I like the Johny Depp thing hes got going on. Looks nice.
bro look like he about to fight Davey jones
Mark silently recreating the Brittany Broski meme was perfect. 5:05
High five Lixian, you magnificent editing genius. Oh also hi Mark. :)
2:16 hi mark 😊
yayyy new markiplier review! missed these mark
If there’s one thing I’ve learned watching this, it’s that a highly zoomed 3/4 angle camera is one of the best comedic tools an editor can have
I have been waiting for this since distractible
mark pls clean under your nails im so scared
You Icelanders out there did Mark get the popular candies from your land?
Mark referenced this video on Distractible, where he said he filmed this before going to Iceland, and before the volcano erupted. How long has this video been in the backburner? lol
Yo mark they remastered slender the arrival you gotta play it
THE WHISTLE PART😂
43:42 made me really sad 😢
This is a super random question but does anyone know where to get the jacket he’s wearing?
Mark, you need to rest, you even have blue circles under your eyes visible in the video, no matter how hard you try to hide them... Take a week off and relax! We, your fans, are very worried about your health! Even the Russian fans are worried about you... please, on behalf of all of us, your fans, take a vacation from filming... Don't strain yourself, we love you for who you are and it doesn't really matter to us if you disappear for a couple of weeks, as long as you're healthy
37:07 Ik like good and plenty ITS LICORICE
Vol-canoes
i love how the candy slides in like it’s that “old time rock and roll” scene from risky business
He got 13/22 score for Icelandic candy guesses btw
Enter your mind? lol my mind is fucked up 😂u don’t wanna see my mind
I love that he summoned the dogs with the whistle 😭😭
I love this peak in to the real mark and amy  :D  great vid guys ! <3
Mark you sound like a Sim talking while trying to pronounce the names. lol  Also I was dying at the slide whistle intros after that candy. lol
Hockerpulver is so good!
To be honest, the handsomer version and tad funnier Bobby Lee
I saw the last licorice and I've tasted them before, I was like you better like them bc they're amazing, I loved your  reaction bc it was literally the same as my own when I tasted them the first time xDd
Ah Turkish peber, taste of Finland I love those Fazer candied
I honestly though he was gonna say, "not my grandma, she's dead!"
48 minutes of licorice!
I love how Lixian basically abused the tiny melody made by Mark with the candy whistle
My mom hordes the last one. We have at least 3 containers in our fridge at a time.
Ooh, I've never seen colourful Tyrkisk Peber! Now I want to try them as well! My mum and brother love the original though, so I don't know if they'd like these ones.
Thanks for this, had a rough day today and the laughs were very much needed.  *_insert whistle tune here_*
Is it just me or did Mark playing the melody lolly sound like a song from In The Night Garden once he got into it 😂😅
btw they did that to the bubble gum because it was dark to chew gum when it was frozen.
Lmao nah not pinched it was cut
It's so funny seeing you horribly pronounce warning:intense flavor and then convulse over how salty it is just gets me
you miss used the word conjecture
whats is happening in the beginining?
Omg I miss bubble gum powder. Loved that stuff as a kid. The American version was hubba Bubba bubble jug. I wish it wasn't discontinued
Has anyone noticed the older he gets the more korean he looks?
The joy I experienced once he got to skolekritt (school chalk) is immense. Although I didn't like that he was sucking on it instead of immediately biting, but I get why he'd be scared to in case it was rock solid. XD
I wanna go to Iceland, it’s legitimately like another planet- also I know this is off topic, but here’s for anyone who feels they’ve lost hope and needs to hear this: whether you believe in Heaven or not, consider this, if there was a Heaven, are you sure you’d go there after death? If you’re not sure, here you go: God loves you, and he became a human as Jesus, died to take the penalty for anything wrong you’d ever do, and rose from the dead. Sin is disobedience to Jesus’ commandments for how to live, and sin separates us from him- if you want to be saved from hell and be with God forever after death, just believe in Jesus and what he did (John 3:16) and turn away from habits of sin (Luke 13:3). That’s it. Our actions are the evidence for whether our faith is real (James 2:17), but since everyone fails on a daily basis, we aren’t saved by our actions, but only by God’s mercy (Ephesians 2:8-9), so when we fail, all we need to do is confess our sins to God, and continue fighting (1 John 1:9). Hopefully this helps anybody in need, and I hope you have a great day!
both Mark AND Amy went through every unpleasant emotion a human could have with that one salty candy lmao
Glad to see Amy alive and well, haven't seen her in a bit.
I didnt know mark has 3 dogs now 😂 when did that happen
i can see chica look at you like saying something a bit like"i love you daddy" *laughs hard* why did i say that?
That fucking noise when he licked his fingers... My skin actually crawled off my body
"I think this is authentic" *has swedish flag on the bag*
Im a man who doesn't laugh at like, anything.   Mark's realization that the slide whistle actually works actually gave me a pure laugh for the first time in like 6 months. 18:48
both Mark AND Amy went through every emotion a human could have with that one salty candy lmao
Mark: Candy from grandma! Not my grandma, my grandma’s… Korean. Me: I thought you were gonna say dead. Live long grandma.
Mark’s performance started out a bit dry, but once he wet his whistle I started jamming out (18:20)
I love how you can tell Lixian went for the kill as soon as he saw Bit potential in this.
12:46 reminds me of Wall-E trying to decide if a spork goes with the spoons or the forks
Mjärkiplier??????
yummer
bro those wisle lollies where everything when my mom finnaly got me one i played it sm and yes my mom hated it and stoped getting them XD BUT normal lollies i still made them make noise well the plastic ones before the paper thing
43:41 Thank You Markiplier!
You should review more MRE's just say you "bought them online" a lot 👍
Was that Spencer?????
I'm in Canada and we had those melody pops as a kid in the 80's/90's lol not sure if the name was that or whistle pop
Markiplier doesn’t believe in volcanos. This is anti volcano mark
43:44 MatPat seen
What part of iceland where you In
I like licorice too a little  but not overly crazy iceland has too much licorice
Also, I hope you enjoyed Iceland!! ❤
The fact mark looks like a pirate tasting candy is so funny to me
Comment for a hug!💜 (Will legit rp hug you)
i feel like this entire video could be summed up with: Surprise, it’s liquorice…again :)
Fazer is one of the best Finnish companies for confectionery. They do amazing chocolate and their candy tastes like old fashioned sweets. There is different flavour Turkish Peppers and I swear to God one of them tastes like dentists oral anesthetic but apparently my Finnish friends love that flavour. I got revenge and sent them marmite. 🇬🇧
Nicely done Markiplier mate, well done. Love the puppies. ❤❤
Wait a minute when did mark have three dogs
To all those people who apparently question whether or not Mark and Ethan are still friends- here is your answer. Uncle Mark is babysitting Spencer ❤ Rest assured that they are still very close friends
Would he make a playlist called markiplier reviews
we like our liquorice
we landed a government grant btw… built an engine… yep… now we moving again.
Alternate title for this video: 49 minites of Mark struggling to open packaging.
🤔 holy crap is that Amy… its been 4 years. since i heard her on your video…
The dog coming to see what the heck is going on when he was playing the whistle pop😂
31:33 just sounds so simlish 🤣
Funny thing is that in a town/city in the northern part Akureyri (Mark was there) there has been a debate 2 wether loose cats should be banned so everyone has 2 put the cats on a leash :)
man, I missed this kind of videos. For some reason you feel relly connected with mark at this, and is just fun to experience the whole thing just for that. <3 Mark
I really hope that whistle sound bite is used a lot in future content.
Does anyone know which state has the best candy
I feel like there’s so much icelandic candy that he missed that he would’ve liked!! 🥲 Also I hate the salty licorice with a passion and am 100% icelandic 😅
Why all pink and black candy? Just curious if there is a reason? I don't know anything about how licorice is made lol!
23:13 where i left off of
i really want licorice now
Ye nah  the goopy gum is meant to come out flouresent pink. Good mark didnt gargle it
The season is almost upon us, it is time to buy a bunch of maple flavored candies and goodies from canada and do the ultimate maple flavor test Mark...DO IT! (February/march is usualy the season)
Tritlar 💀                                                Hitler 💀
Mark try candy from Brazil
if you want to get to the candy-eating part, just skip to 2:50  btw, i got information from google about if ammonium chloride (from the definitely not coke candy) is bad for you, and here's what google had to say about it: Patients administered ammonium chloride should be carefully monitored to avoid metabolic acidosis and ammonia toxicity. Ammonium chloride overdose can cause excessive acidity of body fluids (metabolic acidosis) resulting in disorientation, confusion and coma.
Mark should def try Brazilian candy
Djöflar is also a Swedish sweet and it is the saltiest licorice in the world
licorice
Can I just say how amazing that fire effect on the black candy looked
Can you play outlast trials please
"theres no such thing as volcanos." i agree i haven't seen em
Who would’ve think doing an intro for such a light topic would be so difficult?
Hey Mark, my 4 year old loves to watch your videos and specifically asks to watch you. She loves when you played alien isolation. Anyway, she said hi and she loves you lol
Dear Mark I know you probably won’t read this but I will sadly no longer be watching your videos at least I don’t think so I am a Christian and I have watched your videos for a few years but I will sadly not continue because I don’t appreciate you using Gods name in vain or swearing in general so I will no longer be watching your videos granted I might come back if you stop cursing or if I am tempted but I do hope you well Thank You
Swedish candy next time plz 🇸🇪
Lovely Jubbly.
I want a sour patch kids diss track from markiplier by the end of the week.
I'm delighted to say that I am a proud owner of 3 nipples. Weird flex. I feel appreciated. :)
What, if you didn't see cats in Iceland, are you sure you were even here? There are cat cafes and famous cats that have their own facebook pages (like the one in the bookstore in Laugarvegur). 😂
He’s really coming for MatPat’s job. Lord of lore and now food theory 😂
I love this look. Mark looks so badass  with his haircut.  Also hi, i haven't watched in a while
Food and drink containers have special seals here because there was a random person putting cyanide into Tylenol capsules at pharmacies across Chicago in 1982. Tylenol had to recall their product, added seals, and changed to tablets instead of gel capsules. It's wild how recent that was, and how fast safety protocols can change and be exploited
next time, Mark, you should try candy from Bulgaria. I will send them to you personally.
This video is great and funny but did anyone else want to watch Henry and Chica playing in the background? I kinda got excited when mark moved the one camera on them, I was hoping for a spit screen 😂
This is unc Trump I appreciate ya
I can see why he was looking foword to the wizle one. That was heck funny😂
Licorice candies are like getting into liking beer. Like yeah you really don't like the taste when you first start. But then you get really into them. But you can't have too many at once or they get gross again.
Core memory unlocked, but I remember bubbledust here in America. Not sure if it was called the same thing, but I remember dusty gum that came in that container.
"I try not to eat things I don't trust" Oh but drinking pee is fine, I suppose? 😂
Missed one of these
BABE GET UP! Mark's reviewing more candy!!!
Ummm the tub o'gum is the best gum ever ❤❤. I'm from Michigan and between that gum and the tin of gum bandages those were 90s staples 😅😅.
Jokes aside, Athletic NA beer is actually a good beer - there are so many bad ones too.
YESSS I HAVE BEEN WANTING A NEW CANDY REVIEW FROM X COUNTRY FOR FOREVER YESSSSS HAAA
The jingle kills me every time
I mean, we are going to be having eruptions a lot in the future, so don't worry about it ❤😂  🌋🇮🇸😂
I would like to tell everyone Icelandic chocolate is the BEST chocolate I ever ate
YAY! He did end up posting it
can't believe i'm now trapped in mark's mind forever
The whistle candy made my dog go nuts
31:50 ish, Ive never jumped so fast to get a 'reaction face' screenshot to use in messaging
you know the icelandic cat jolakottur if you listen to the yogpod
*Happy Amy Noises*
OMG PINBALLS????? as a brit my heart is so full i used to eat those things like fruit <33333333333333
23:11 bets that 'Socker' is sugar?
YESSSSSS
so glad chicas legs are growing in well
Yo thank you for doing this
Babe wake up, new Markiplier review video just dropped
Candy with eternal entrapment in Mark's mind...that seems great XD Anyways keep up the amazing videos Mark
okay, that was a lot of candy that you ate, which is Swedish
Markiplier is out here making bangers since 2014
Athletic Brewing Company IPA is my favorite beer. I don't drink alcohol anymore, so these days, occasionally I get a sixer of Athletic IPA and it's delicious
do what you do best
Why the f*** are you dressed like Korean Rambo?
So the title of the video should read Mark tries candy he bought in Iceland?
i heard that comment about retiring no bad you keep my childhood alive goddamn you i don't wanna see you retire until i do jk just with the light of all the youtubers saying they are retiring i don't wanna see you go too
Mark went from a man who owns five ovens to a man who owns five cameras.
i love Mark's expressions during the ones he doesn't like 😂😂😂😂
5 hours early
4:57 "I'm willing to bet this is probably authentic" *has a swedish flag on the front*
E
Warning to anyone who has problems with mouth sounds. This video has a lot of them.😂
I'm from the US and I used to have some of these all the time as a kid. Totally forgot about powder gum and melody pops, and now I crave them again!
Markiplier food/snack reviews is the best I missed this content xD
I like how Mark is bit by bit turning into a biker
...please tell me the "could be Dutch" part is a joke :'D It probably is, but I've heard of enough people mixing Denmark and The Netherlands. (All, english's fault for calling stuff from the Netherlands "dutch".)
Apparently ammonium chloride is also used in many smelling salts so yeah.
I could watch the first minute and 40 seconds of this video forever
😕why is mark dressed like a pirate? And why is he eating Icelandic candy? I’m confused.....
I went to Iceland a few years ago and it was infested with cats
0:30 Markiplier is joining the QSMP?! /j
I love how Mark talks about how much he loves salt, thinking he's odd for it, not understanding how much we LOVE salt and salty sweets (or candy as Americans say it) such as salmiakki (salted liquorice) here in the nordic countries XD   As a Finn and North European, this video brings me much joy. Especially when Mark tasted the Turkish pepper :D  Also when Mark talks about the sweets not being HOT, it's because he thinks of the word as an American and Korean, but we concider those sweets hot, because that's what the word means to us :)
can't wait for the "i want you to enter my mind" memes
Listening to Mark trying to pronounce things in my language is a thing I never expected to happen 😂
*HENRY* 2:51
This video was such a rollercoaster for every dane watching it. Such a joy to have our candy declared as the best but at the same time Mark forgot we exist...
Mark, I’m so sorry to be the one to break this to you, but there are cats in Iceland. I befriended one during my time there, and we spent a brief, but overall happy moment together.
The hdhd in this video is great
Welcome to the world of salmiakki, Mark. Licorice that is salted with ammonium chloride. It is the saltiest candy ever made. An acquired taste
You might want to consider a nose hair trimmer. Just sayin.
Loving Mark's recent Johnny Depp-esque fashion choices
I miss this series. Don’t yell at me mark.
12:40 choosing whether or not a candy is Icelandic with markiplier
Well I know I'd never like their candy then, I can't even stand the smell of licorice. I just love his reactions
Mark is very expressive when he eats food 😂
Love to see Lixian appear once again in the videos!
New title: "I reviewed licorice"
Lets go þetta er flott  hjá þér
I’m pretty sure the U.S. has something similar to bubble dust, including it being in a Jerry can but I think it’s the Bubble Yum version.
YOU WERE IN ICELAND AND I MISSED IT?!!?!
Is it just me or does Iceland have an affinity for licorice?
Im not sure if its just me but watching mark struggleing to pronounce things is just funny as hell😂
"I want you to enter my mind"...      "WAS THAT THE BITE OF '87?"
"No cats in Iceland". That explains the Jólakötturinn legend in Iceland
Fi fi fi fu fi!
That gränna candy is swedish and not icelandic
Ufo candy also german
cut ur hair
Tubble gum is meant to be open like that
These always make me think of the jolly green giant and del montre videos 😂
I love Mark's videos. This is literally the only subscription I have left lmao.
Reminds me of that old DanTDM video with the jellybeans lol
As a Dane I am happy that you liked the final candy. It’s a danish brand which makes a bunch of different variants with different flavours (I actually don’t know if they all contain liquorish  as I’ve only ever tasted one of the many variants). I personally like the chocolate coated liquorish too :) Edit: would be cool to see a danish candy tasting video
Dying laughing in the first 2 minutes ❤❤❤❤
Love the video but I absolutely hate the ASMR and I wish youtubers would stop that. Watching with just CC running doesnt quite cut it.
Ngl mark could do these as asmr
i HAD THE JERRYCAN as a kid in Canada. Brings back memories :)
omg... lamb's head. Does he mean smalahove? Or does iceland have a different lamb's head dish than here in norway? XD
Holy shit the whistle sucker gave me crazy childhood flashbacks
7:39 perfect thing to say when there humans😂
I LOVE THE REVIEWSSSSSSS 😭😁😁😭😭😭😁😁😁😭😭😭😭😁😭😁😭😁😁😁😭😁😁
I missed theses
This taught me that Icelandic people like salt, licorice, and salty licorice.
YESSSSSSSSSSS
Babe wake up, Markiplier just upload a new review video!
um mark according to google ammonium chloride is used in batteries, but Ammonium chloride is an inorganic chemical compound with the formula NH 4Cl and a white crystalline salt that is highly soluble in water. Solutions of ammonium chloride are mildly acidic. In its naturally occurring mineralogic form, it is known as sal ammoniac.
Bro, he does not know that upon eating ammonium chloride, he ate something used to make pipe lining or things like plumbing pipes,  and you know batteries and fertilizer. I liked mark I hope he does not die( I am joking but geez I hope I am wrong and it is 100 percent safe)
Lmao, I'm only five minutes in, but seeing him put the icelandic named candy bar into "not icelandic" and thinking the swedish named (that even has the swedish flag on it) candy is authentic icelandic, is so hilarious.
We icelandic people love licorice so if u don't like licorice and want candy let someone help u pick out the once that don't have licorice 😅
Such a great video review!!! Loved seeing all the different candies, and Marks reaction! Plus, just noticed...he got another doggo? The little black and white one?!?!?
bruh where is Iron Lung I'm so ready
Is the first one just a lion bar? Idk i havent had a lion bar in ages but it looks like one
I lost it at the gummy faces LMAO
DARK MARK WAS IN THE INTRO!!
I've looked up, and they said they do have and the candy whistle they have them in the uk, and markiplier blow it. It reminds me of the  1969 children show ,the clangers, and the maoam ball they have them in uk sweet that said they look like nipples 😹😹😹 I think they are a mushroom sweet we also have them In the UK 🇬🇧 sorry if My spelling mistake is wrong and sorry if it's so long for reading
Markiplier really pulling off the pirate look god damn
Markiplier when there is no fun horror games other than FNAF help wanted 2 and lethal company
I laughed so hard when Mark tried the Hockey Pulver because its swedish i think atleast and i laughed because i know how bad it tastes i felt so sorry for him 😭😅
Actually the volcanos have been erupting in Iceland a lot recently!
Yeah we learned about this in geography class a couple days ago. Iceland has a well known dish called "sheep testicles", and in case you were wondering what "sheep testicles" are, I literally cannot think of a single reason why you would ask that question.
a lot of licorice
Markiplier I have a question so I’m gonna help you get the secret ending and help wanted 2 so there’s something in the cowboy ride there’s a secret in there🤫 and I’m gonna help you get it so when you’re in there, I want you to hit three helpys once you hit them all you might see a treasure chest
You know it’s a good day when mark uploads
That jug of powder gum we have here in the states. Just a different brand and different color jug.
One thing about the icelandic people. They gone make the best candy.
is @21:50 Hokkey Pulver a Dutch kind of treat? like that particular powdered form of dubbel zout stuff?
Istg if he gets the jerry can candy right and he retires 😭😭😭😭
Petition for every video to have a dog camera
It's so funny to see ppl oversees try different types of licorice as someone who grew up with all imaginable types of it. One type that always reminds me of my childhood is one that came in the form of a tiny pill, super hard and quite salty but the taste would linger for so long afterwards.
The next instalment in my favourite Markiplier series
I missed these types of videos
bro dressed like a explorer like the look!
What an interesting journey Iceland must have been. I saw this documentary about how Iceland has frozen woolly mammoths. They were perfectly preserved and they had plans to take the DNA of the baby wooly mammoth they took for science and mix it with the DNA of an elephant to sort of bring back the wooly mammoth, but it would be a hybrid obviously. But the documentary ends there so the rest is history? 😆
This is the only person I’d watch eat candy for almost an hour straight with no breaks….
The whistle candy I remember from the 80s. Memories!!!
The little whistle tune playin inbetween candies is so good
This review makes me see flavour
Face reveal! Legendary...fun....
Granna sure looked like a rollercoaster of flavors.
37:04 I'm going to take a wild guess and call it licorice. Edit: Yeup.
The whistle sound is iconic . I hope to hear more of it in the future
If there's one thing I've learned from my Canadian boyfriend, is that people from other countries are very positive things exclusive to their country are world wide normal   Watching the Canadian candy vid had him in a spiral 😆
Is it bad that I watched a good part of the video in 1.5 speed and didn't even question it? I was just like, dang his ADHD is going crazy
I love that Mark and I both called the little gummy people terrifying 😂
I love this review videos glad its back
I need a person in my life that will look at me the same as Amy looks at Mark playing on a chupa chups whistle for straight 2 minutes and think "I fucking love him so much"
6:09 "So that's going in the Icelandic pile." Swedes: **confused noises**
*Jólakötur:* Icelandic *Hjärtligt gott från gränna:* Swedish *Trítlar:* Icelandic *Sneaky bubbledust:* USA/UK *Stjörnu rúlla:* Icelandic *Chokolade & pebermynte:* Undetermined, Not Icelandic (Does anyone know the language?) *Tyrkisk peber original:* Finnish *Melody pops:* USA *Hallonlakrits svampar:* Swedish *Supersalt hokey pulver:* Swedish *Pinballs:* German *Súper sett:* Icelandic *Opal:* Icelandic *Bismarks klumper:* Undetermined, Not Icelandic (Does anyone know the language?) *Djöflar:* Icelandic *Tubble gum:* French (I think) *Þristur:* Icelandic *Tyrkisk peber skolekridt:* Danish weirdly *Tyrkisk peber hot & sour:* Finnish *Frisia sour UFO tongue painter:* Belgian *Lakkrís rör:* Icelandic *Lakrids by Bülow:* Danish Mark's final score: 15/22

13:05 When he was going through different Nordic langauges, I literally went "Oh god don't say Dutch."  ... Maaark. *Maaaaaaaaaaaark!* Do you think it's scalled "Denmmurk"?!?!?!? >:(
Mark is looking like Jack Sparrow. 😂
No wonder Halloween hasn’t take off in Scandinavia. That amount of licorice would literally murder a child.
0:15 twin towers
Can u play ban ban 😊
Honestly surprised you didn't see any cats in Iceland, when I went a few years back, I went to a cat cafe and might've seen a stray cat just walking around the streets (although it was a while ago so I'm not sure.)
The saltiest thing was double salt licorice
Congratulations Mark, now you have been licoriced and must now spread the good word of licorice!
I’m Australian, and Melody pops were a staple of my childhood!
I love that he says " It's just a theory! A food theory!"
To many intros I can’t keep count when the intro stopped 😂
Mark discovering soft licorice exists
Have to say he should have chosen the green opal (I have never seen the yellow one)
candy coated mushrooms, licorice swirls, scandinavians STRUGGLING to beat the allegations they are all just gnomes living in a giant enchanted forest named Sweden
On the whole "I don't know if it's real" just thinking "I review human drugs, now I can't confirm if the drugs actually come from humans or if my neighbor in *insert star system here* just lied to me and they're from his planet."
The Trítlar candy always looked so joyful to me until markiplier ruined it
Omg hes so Portuguese
I swear i need a movie with Mark and Keanu Reeves. PLEASE! PLEEEEASE! let it happen! It can even be about Bob's fridge! I don't care.
43:40  Nice one Mark. :) Honestly, that was completely unexpected, but it was funny.
thank god finally something else other than Five nights at Freddie and lethal company thank you 😭
New video title: mark eats mostly licorice for almost an hour
41:20 did I spy a Spencer 👀
18:52 : Markiplier woke up a house of 9 sleeping dogs and created absolute chaos
"I am mark, and I am plier."
Please play KinitoPET a horror game.
Is he doing this in a hotel lobby or something like wtf lol
is it ... a licoris?
Scared Mark noises 30:53
As a Danish person, I’m overjoyed to see Mark eat my favourite candy. I'm not a big licorice fan myself, but I love the licorice from licorice Bulow and they even come in different flavors here in Denmark, such as strawberry!
Hey Mark, if you like gum that pumches you in the face, look for a brand called Grenades. It is violently minty, like a cough drop and gum had a baby. There are other flavors, but they all clear the sinuses.
In Denmark (which Tyrkisk Peber is from", we blend it with vodka, and drink it as shots 😅
The Djöflar reaction had me in tears. My goodness that was flipping funny!
Wait, we don't get to find out how correct he was...? tf??
The pinballs are pronounced Ma-O-Am
the blow whisle lollypop we have in aus they are so much fun
The cat thing is a whole story behind it, so as some may know we have 13 Santa clauses and those 13 own a big cat that eats naked children. (Those who don't get clothes as a Christmas present) so that  cat theory thing was used against children who didn't want clothes for Christmas cause the parents didn't want the children to be cold.
If I knew u were in iceland I would have wanted to see u I'm from iceland and have been your follower since 500k subscribers and  I have always wanted to meet u
And remember, there are no volcanos in Ba Sing Se.
Soon mark is about to visit, denmark, finland, norway and sweden just to eat more ''Candy''
I got Corridor Digital vibes from the opening “enter my mind” stuff
I'm not saying that Mark's not funny, but this wouldn't remotely have gotten as many laughs out of me if it wasn't for Lixian.
Props to Lixian for the comedic timed screams as the sweets fall.  Also I believe Maoam is German in origin, but it's one of my favs to eat in the UK. I'm a sucker for fruity chews.
my favorite series is back!!
Nothing has ever felt as relatable as the intro to this video, including the disembodied voice of reason that I can't help but goof with.
Wait… this isn’t fnaf…
Wait a minute did Mark swallow the powdered gum? Side note the slide whistle candy is adorable and it sounds like an actual slide whistle, which is so cool.
Intro took half of my break at work 😭
1:45 Darkiplier rides again 😂🎉❤.
mark getting antagonized by licorice for 49 mins
Yes that was the swedish flag on the second candy 💀
salty licorice - icelandic  yummy sugary licorice - probably finland
Who would betray mark? 😮 im hankering for sour candy rn.  Turkish pepper are so good 😌
i love marks reaction to all the candy and i saw him in iceland
We love Markiplier asmr
as a person who has never been to Iceland and has a little bit of icelandic heritage i can confirm that might be icelandic candy
Not a fan of licorice. I'll eat it, but only if it's the only option. I feel like I'd be going the chocolate route if I went to Iceland for sweets. A little curious about that salt one though. Had salted fish once that was saltier than a handful of salt.
Omg please give Lixian a raise 🤣 he's a goddamn genius!!
You heard it here first. Volcanoes, are in fact, not real. In Markiplier we trust.   Have you not heard of Jólakötturinn? The Yule Cat - Icelandic folk lore says that if children do not get new clothes (maybe socks?) for as a gift during Yuletine/Christmas, that Jólakötturinn will come and eat them, as he prefers to eat dirty children who have old dirty clothes. This may not be 100% accurate but I learned about it from Dungeon Crawler Carl! :D
barely half of those were actually icelandic, but I'm glad that most of the ones he liked were authentic. (Except Djöflar, which literally means "devils".)
Love the video! - but most of that candy was either Swedish or Danish.. xD
God I've missed Amy in videos. Oh, Mark's here too.
idk why but i am happy that Mark is as much as a salt lover as me
the þ found at 35:23 is called a thorn and was used in old English. It makes a 'th' sound and if you wanna see it used in English, you can do so by looking up poems and such from the 1400s.
lakrids by bulow is amazing. i fucking love them
19:06 dog is like “What are you doing there?”
15:15 Blast
Mark has entered his pirate arc
I literally screamed when I read the title, the fact people don’t our Candy often🇮🇸 and it’s my bday🩷💗💗 this is so big for me as an Icelandic person❤️❤️
34:36 we eat those in Italy too!! We call them gessetti (chalk) because they look like it😂🎉
As an Icelandic person this video has caught me very off guard
*Laughs in Swedish seeing alot of our candy*
Note to self, don’t eat candy in Iceland.
Hi mark Im from iceland and made a list of all the things that are icelandic and not 😆   1 jóla kótturin - Christmas cat, icelandic  2 gränna, swedish  3 trítlar, icelandic  4 bubbledust, UK Never even seen that😆   5 stjörnu rúlla - star roll, icelandic  6 white balls, icelandic i think? Could not see the packaging very well  7 Tyrkish peber. Finnish  8 chupa chubs Whistle, not icelandic  9 nippels, swedish  10 hockey pulver, not icelandic  11 maoam pinballs, German  12 super sett, icelandic  13 opal, icelandic  14 red and white mint, icelandic i think?   15 djöflar - devils, icelandic  16 tubel gum, not icelandic  17 Risa þristur - huge Third, Proudly icelandic!

YEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS more mark content for the wiiiiiiin
What a great ad for Mark's dentist 😂
As someone who has recently been to Iceland and experienced a lot of cultural shock from the food, this was a great watch
no.
NO WAY U DIDNT SEE ANY CATS THEYRE LITERALLT EVERYWHERE THERE BRO
5:02 - When Mark won't tell you updates on Iron Lung.
As a  Finn you my Dear sir, insult the whole nation of Finland and me by not liking the Tyrkisk peber candies. Good day to you!
Idk if ur suppose to but I usually put the powder ones in water to give it flavor and it's amazing so o think if mark did that they would been higher rating
The jerry can of gum used to be sold by (i think) Hubba Bubba. We used to buy them all the time when we were kids visiting Honduras. I loved them! They were less powder and more like crumbles. super fun and i kind of miss it.
me at 3am
“It’s not hard” *crunch* 😶🫠
moooooom! New Markiplier Review's video is out! Get the camera!
I went to Iceland this summer and it was one of the most fun experiences of my life. hope u had as much fun as i did!
As someone from Iceland, this video was absolutely beautiful. Masterpiece, and we are honored that you are trying our foods.
❤
No skum?
the close ups make me realize mark has long nose hair
Gränna Sweden ❤
I can see your pores mark
One of the early ones Mark ate that he called a “sweet” licorice, then he thought it might be Swedish or Dutch - if the licorice that my Dutch father-in-law loves is any indication of the kind of licorice that comes from the Netherlands, there is NOTHING sweet about it. It is salt, salt, and MOAR SALT. I swear, I don’t know how the man has even nominally normal blood pressure (bless him). So that one probably isn’t Dutch.  But yes - Nordic countries love their licorice.
How does he get more handsome each video
Being Icelandic, seeing mark review Icelandic candy is such a pleasure
Tyrkish Pebber is from Finland 😆 there’s salty liquorice in the middle, they also have another bag with ”fruit flavor” but still the salty part in the middle. Fazer also makes nice chocolate 😋
😂❤
Man throughout that whole weird close-up intro, all I could think of is "Wow, those _are_ nice lenses!"
I have no nipples😁
Ah, the mint chocolate argument famous among Kpop stars. Peppermint is added to toothpaste to make you think your mouth is clean (it has basically no purpose, but creates a cooling "fresh" feel and it's in almost every toothpaste, which sucks for people who don't like it, or in my case, it wakes me up when I'm tried and want to sleep even though I like peppermint.). So the whole common argument that it tastes like toothpaste is wrong, it's that toothpaste tastes minty and mint is used in far far more than toothpaste.  I had Melody when I was a kid, or something similar. I always thought it was inspired by Chitty Chitty Bang Bang given the sweets that could play musical notes.
I'm Finnish and a we have a few of these over here too. The blue version of Tyrkisk Peber is one of my go-to candy bags lmao. The hockey puck salmiakki powder is something I ate as a kid a lot, less now but still get occasionally. The squeezable gum? I bought a fuck ton of it when I was like 10 and proceeded to shove all of it in my mouth to the point where I couldn't close my mouth. Good times.
Omg the melody pop was such a throw back to my childhood 🥺
Mark, I had headphones in. Where should I send the medical bill after you burst my eardrums with the melody whistle?
Oh wow. A new Markiplier video that isn't horror related? It's about time, but sadly it's not gonna last.
Like every not iclantic candy is from Finland🇫🇮 like the blue hot salmiakki or the maoam or the lollipop or the hockey pulver
Let me tell you, in Sweden we have a liquorice 10x the salt of that one at 33:30 😅
gotta be honest i fucking love everything salty liquorice, the more ammonium chloride the better, but when I tasted djöflar for the first time I thought eating more than two was going to kill me by just stopping my heart right then and there
We have those MAOM in the UK the pinballs are so nice! but so are the strips you just cant help but eat the whole bag.
what's with marks obsession with bandannas these days
Oh good, Mark is chewing his food
The fact when the choices were up i moved my mouse over in preperation to choose a choice means Markiplier has trained me well in CYOA
Volcanoes don't exist, confirmed by Dr. Markiplier the fifth.
My Finnish heart is crying for Tyrkish Pepper
The whistle sucker has note markings on it because there is music on the inside of the wraper that you can play with it.
My husband loves the salt licorice - or double salted licorice. He wanted me to ask if you also experienced the salt sweats.
Wait is Mark with Ethan because when he went to let the dogs out at 41:17 Spencer was there...
I've always wondered what was wrong with you. You only had one grandma. It all makes sense now
Anyone else have the jingle stuck in their head, or is that just me? 😂
Why r so many of these swedish💀
Poppy playtime 3 pls
The taste in the center of the Fazer candy is salmiakki, and its from Finland. That said, Torille.
Markiplie ASMR enjoyers 👇
I really don't know why, but these types of videos are so incredibly funny.  Also 45:28 is just perfect comedic timing.
I’ve been getting a lot of snack boxes from different countries lately and my advice is to look at the back of the bag and it should say product of Iceland if it is indeed authentic.
As an Icelander I physically cringed every time he got a guess wrong.
I thought it was just ice cubes.
the "Falling scream" added in anytime something falls or is thrown in these videos. I swear that's my favorite gag and sound effect. Gets me every time
Mark Sparrow
Why does mark look like Eddy vetter
I think that Lixian did a very good job with the intro.
YAY THANK YOU FOR REVIEWING ICELANDIC CANDY
thanks for the laughs i needed that
Ohh many of the candy I see is also available in my country.
We have the first ones in the UK. They're called Toffee Crisp
I love that this is basically Icelandic candy (with the Nordics on the side)
Those chocolate balls are the greatest candy here in Scandinavia
I love Amy just arguing with Mark in the background, so funny
YOU HAVE ABANDONED BARN FINDERS
Markiplier: “Alright enter my mind”  Marks mind: “Hello everybody my name is Mindiplier”
Mark with a long hair and a bandana is making me... feel things.  All kind of...things.
opal looks like a medicine box
Poor amy
Seeing Mark become Iceland’s greatest reviewer fills you will determination
you should try Finnish candies
Did mark just unknowingly walk into a licorice store? X)
Yay! This was a lot of fun to watch. Thanks for posting.😁🥰
its so funny watching mark trying to speak skandinavian languages
The Tyrkisk Peber is actually Finnish and they're one of my favourite candies! There's another brand called ”Gifu” that's similar and has a ”hot” version (which imo is much spicier because it has chili in it)  Edit: Correction, apparently Tyrkisk Peber it was originally made in Denmark but was bought by Fazer.
Was that Spenser?
THERE NO ICELAND YOU ONLY ATE SWEDISH CANDY
Corrected title "Reviewing Swedish candy" 😂
Fazer is a large finnish candy producer. High quality chocolates and everything else. Also, put the turkisk peber's into a bottle of vodka to make a delicious black liquid. Like all of them. Don't put too few, needs to be saturated. Crush em in there. And pour some out first to make space. I don't have a problem.
I cant tell if us british just stole a bunch of these sweets or what bevause a few of the icelandic ones are like regular pick n mix sweets
I like to imagine that foreigners to the US accidentally buy beanboozled to try American candy
Me watching Mark and Amy trying the Djöflar and wondering if it's worse then "Salt jävlar"
you should do norway next👍
Time for Icelandic lore the jólaköttur is a pet cat of a troll named grýla and he eats cildhren that don't get new clothes for Christmas and grýla is the mother of the thirteen santas
"They don't have American food health standards" ain't that even more of a reason to eat it than not then 😂
dont you just love watching a grown man try candy from a foreign country for 50 minutes straight? same bestie same
Enter my mind: air, planes, towers, shit fuck!
Of all the stuff that Mark makes, random videos like these are what I miss the most. Glad to be back for another banger.
That intro freaked me out for a second because i am literally on a plane right now. I'm also high which is very much NOT helping  Markiplier: "I want you to enter my mind. Plane. Air. Sky." Me on a plane:  My high ass: "AM I IN MARKIPLIER'S MIND????!?"
Fazer is finnish chocolate and candy company (also makes cookies and other bakery stuff). Founded by a chocolatier and sport shooter named Karl fazer. Fazer (company) also makes dumle and tutti frutti which both are Swedish candy first made by mazetti but now part of fazer. My favourites are fazer blue chocolate bar (fazerin sininen) and Pätkis (in form of small chocolate bite things and chocolate bars and other stuff like ice cream but mainly just chocolate bars and bites) probably because I’m from Finland
Can u mark try finnish candys 🎉🎉🎉🎉🇫🇮🇫🇮🇫🇮😫
At least its not denmark.
i can tell this was probably shot around the time mark threw boiled eggs at ethan cuz of his killer headband LOL
Don’t fucking give your dogs candy at all what is wrong with you guys?
I love amy at the start just making fun of mark 😭
Mark thinks Danish = Dutch. Day ruined.
I swear i heard him talking about talking about volcanos in like distractible before a long time ago what is this
No "thank you Lixian" at the end for editing this for him?!
Look Mark it's okay in here but there is just a lot of stuff about space
I no longer believe in volcanos
Wow, people from Iceland must LOVE Salt and Licorish
Ammonium Chloride is an odorless, white powder. Solid Ammonium Chloride is used to make dry batteries and Ammonia compounds, as a soldering flux, a pickling agent in Zinc coating and tinning, and a fertilizer. Ammonium Chloride fume, a finely divided particle dispersed in air, is produced in galvanizing operations. its naturally occurring in licorice by the way.
I always love how chaotic Mark's review videos are
48:30 MASOCHIST GF FOR MASOCHIST BF- I-I mean
15:06 No way he bought some tyrkish peber! Finland (Kinda) mentioned! Torille! For some reason people here just loves salty licorice
As someone who can’t stand the sound of people chewing, I suffered through this for Mark 😂
yep...he sure reviewed the candy...
When is Iron Lung coming out
milk based candy is the best in Colombia
Licorice is like the palate cleanser of candies, I don't need it often but every once in awhile I get a real craving for it just to have that mild flavor after eating so many sweets that just power blast my mouth.
Was that Spencer? I thought Spencer was Ethans dog?
Salty licorice candy is also popular in Finland called "salmiakki" and I remember we made some salmiakki (ammonium chloride) in chemistry class once in school and everyone got to taste some! I'm not the biggest fan though. Also, tyrkis peppers (they are Finnish candy) or however you spell it seem to be controversial among us Finns 😂😂 I haven't tasted it cause they seem terrible. Fazer is mainly a chocolate company and their chocolate is absolutely delicious! Most of the candy shelves in stores are stocked with Fazer chocolate.
Never seen the colored Tyrkisk Pæpper one before here in Norway🤔 Yellow🟡, red🔴 and blue🔵 primary colored candy for you! Plus a black⚫️ that tastes like liquorice on crack!
The ASMR parts are so funny.😂 Also, HUGE props to Lixian for making this visually interesting.
Whenn you try german candy one day you gonnaa taste alott of haribos and maoam’s :)
I didn’t think Marks eyes could get that big…and bigger 😂 💀
New legs?
ammonium chloride is toxic....first thing that pops up from typing ammonium chloride candy is that reeeeaally salty one
oh dear god not djölfar that's gonna destroy the lad please god no  edit: he survived praise be, but not unscathed
we have that "candy coated licorice" in the Netherlands and we call it "krijtjes" aka chalk. I loooove them
As a person with misophonia this video is a nightmare. I shut it off at the bubble dust and thumbs down a Markiplier video for the first time.
Love the tune mark made 😅
whats with iceland and yellow packaging?
Yay Iceland finally being mentioned… we exist!!!
47:01  Also very familiar with this one. Several brands.

Not mark crunching down on everything hard, if there was a jawbreaker he would crunch that too
I love how even Amy admits they are somewhat out of practice with the reviews XD
Eso si fue grasoso 😂😂😂😂😂
When mark tries to speak Icelandic it sounds like he’s speaking in sims
Didn't expect William Turner from Pirates of the Carribbean would make his YouTube debut on Icelandic candies.
Ok so, 8 candies on that list are Icelandic, so 14 candies that weren’t, 13 were guessed correctly, 6 of them were actually Icelandic, so 2 Icelandic candies he didn’t identify correctly, Jólaköttur and Stjörnurúlla (1st and 5th candies).  The liquorice straw is usually paired with Appelsín, a local orange soda (at Christmas Appelsín is also traditionally blended together with Malt for a blend that is pretty popular here at Christmas time)
You know it’s gotta be bad when Mark starts convulsing from the salt 😂😂😂
Love your videos
That Maoam is pronounced mow-am
"There's no such thing as volcanoes" is going to age like a fine wine. Mark my words.
Holy shimmies. That whistle pop brought back childhood memories of growing up in rural OK/TX and finding whistle suckers at the gas station.
If you don’t want to swallow it…it’s probably not a 4.5 Mark.
Has Mark never heard of Hubba Bubba Bubble Jug? Ironically, I'm from Ohio and this was something I always saw in gas stations.
That jingle better be a permanent thing on this channel
There was so much close-up in the video that I forgot that it was on purpose, and kept trying to zoom out myself 😂
Tyrkisk Peber is a famos Finnish candy, BUT Its so incredibly bad I give it to my friends as a prank
where is fnaf vr2 part 13
Markiplier reviews is back baby!  Also staccato at 20:00? 👀
“I already said my decision, so that’s going to the Iceland pile… I dOnT lIkE iT”  - Markiplier 2024
The Melody Pop is definitely not Icelandic, I've had them as a kid.
Went to Iceland in like 2017. Was one of the best places I've ever been and it's a little hidden gem of the world
0:15 Towers
Hi daddy
markiplier is just embracing his space pirate personality
most of us icelandic people love djöflar but seeing your reaction when you ate it gave me and my brother a good laugh dw djöflar is REALLY!!!! salty
markiplier  I'm from Iceland And I've been watching your videos since I was a kid I have early memories of getting screens time and using my mother's  Computer to watch your videos And I just want you to know you made my day when I saw this video
This was a wild ride lmao. Mark's expressions were on point every time! Also, Mark looks like he could be in Pirates of the Caribbean, someone plz photoshop him in an scene lol  Edit: OMFG why is no one talking about 45:26 ??? You can't make that up holy sht
Like the drip my man very stylish
As someone from Iceland i can confirm that at least 50% of the candy’s in this video was indeed Icelandic 🇮🇸 i enjoyed seeing my favourite person try my childhood candy’s and i think its funny he got the first chocolate wrong and yes there’s a bunch of cats here like some might say there’s more cats than dogs here in Iceland lol thanks for reading  Hope mark could see this 😅 Your best Icelandic viewer and fan, love from Iceland ❤🇮🇸
You look beautiful mark…😩
I love this, I rarely see big youtubers do this with Icelandic candy and well stuff in general but MARKIPLIER??? I wasn't expecting this, thank you for reviewing our candy Mark! Much love from Iceland  P.s. Almost all Icelandic candy do not have English names
Hjärtligt gott från gränna is swedish candy. Its made in the town of peppermint. Which is called Gränna. We passed through the town when we went to Denmark during the holidays for a couple of years ago, and baught a peppermint supply that lasted for 2 years.😂
OH MY GOD! The candy whistle hit me in the childhood soooo fucking hard! I'm from the US but i remember having a more "sleek" version made of grape candy that also had a slider as the stick. Anyone else have that? I cant remember the company that made them or where to find them now days but if you know please tell me.
So the only thing in Mark's thoughts are the void, stars, and himself? Are we all living in Markiplier's thoughts?
Mark I can tell you that your last and your favorite is not Icelandic it’s Danish Lakrids by Bürlow is Danish quality licorice 🇩🇰🇩🇰 - and FYI despite growing up in a Nordic country as Denmark where licorice is much more common - I’ve never been able to stand licorice 😖 - I’ve only ever bought from the brand you just tasted cuz I had a taste test and the coating around the licorice was SO good 😋
I'm really liking Mark's Pirate of the Caribbean looking phase
Wait isnt Spencer ethans dog??? So confused lol
"Enter my mind" Me: "Is it full of boobs?" I was disappointed, needless to say XD
Alot of licorice is also well known in Holland like those tiny white stiks (school krijtjes teachers charcoal) and the chocolate covered licorice balls  and the salty hell
I've never seen those jerry can's of gum in the UK but I like learning Americans call jerry cans that
I wanna try japaneese candy 😅😊
Does anyone know why mark is on iceland?
love your videos as always keep them up
As someone with three nipples, I'm just so happy to be loved
Can say that the tubble gum IS supposed to be sealed and i was so scared when i saw the color of it inside, definitely pre-shewed by someone.
PLS GO BACK TO WARFRAME I BEG YOU MAKE A WHOLE GOD DAMN SERIES PLS!
The Spencer cameo was pretty iconic
6:34 That *OOOOHHAMNA* send shivers down my spine he's so powerful
This video was so Portuguese
I love how the mic picks up mark's chewing bc when he put in that second opal candy after saying they were soft and the soft crack with his reaction was so funny
36:55  A very familiar candy. I think it has many brand names. Like “liquorice larvas” (as a bad “very direct” translation…).
lets go Iceland!!
Minn maður
4:41 Was I the only one who thought Mark was going to say "Not my grandma, my grandma is dead" lol
18:03 this is the lollipop of Polish childhood (and probably not only Polish)
Now im waiting for the Dutch food review
You know after eating all that candy maybe it's time for a toothpaste review😏
I love salmiakki dude, i'm glad Mark got to try it
I always enjoy Monk Keanu reeves....sorry...I mean Markiplier. A bastion of pleasantness, even in chaos
It’s been 3hrs and im still stuck in markiplier’s mind 😦
Well, "Tyrkisk peber" literally means "Turkish pepper".    In Danish.
but….i love turkish peppers……
14:56 me when I'm asked what's 2+2.
"Crunch" Mark freezes for 5 seconds.  "So you know what I just said about these not being hard?"    SIDE NOTE O JUST DAW H8M EAT THE DJOLFAR. Or whatever the candy after the haunted mask comment! "IsueneosudnFUCKsxidjdn....wHat ThE fUcK?!" I couldnt breathe I was laughing so hard!
Watching Mark pretend to be human is amazing 😂
Sweet Mark reviews is back.
As an Icelandic person ive never clicked faster on a video in all my years of youtube. from the reactions to the pronunciations and the licorice this is possibly the best video on the internet. Mark if you see this i would sell my soul to see you eating harðfiskur, hangikjöt or drinking appelsín.
Bring Fnaf
If you want a true Icelandic Horror movie to watch to understand the culture and the folklore, Watch Tilbury (1987)
the continuous flute tune after like 20 min in
🐁incredibly happy to see þ make an appearance as an avid þ user. its þe letter þorn and is pronounced þe same way you would pronounce þe english "th"!!
20:06 I’m house sitting a family friend’s cat, and the look of pure displeasure she gave me at the sound of Mark playing a beautiful melody on a candy whistle was positively withering.
i love markiplier so much.
I missed these kind of videos
He forgot to say thank you to lixian

Chica enters the video.  Everybody: MORE CHICA!!!!
He spent like 10 minutes of the video trying pronounce them.
31:02 Anybody see a John Wick resemblance?
Anyone else knew this was coming from distractible via Spotify?
Lmao
This is a nice little break from all the horrific moments at lethal company and the mind breaking fnaf help wanted...let's not let ourselves slowly drift away in the ethereal darkness of horror games...
8:34 LITHUANIA MENTIONED 😳😳💪💪😤😤🇱🇹🇱🇹
Mark, this made me laugh so much! I missed these kinds of videos. :D
You got 14 or 15 Correct 🎉🎉  Lost Count
as soon as i saw spencer i went " SPENNCEERRR "
man he hasn't done a "markiplier does stuff" in a long time
I'm loving this Orlando Bloom as Will Turner look Mark's got going on. XD
Tyrone.
I really don't need the mouth smacking sounds while your chewing. How about we lower the volume of the mic when we edit the video. Thanks in advance
🍭 🪈  🎶🎵🎶🎵
The whistle reminds me of the Clangers if anyone knows what that is. I can't hear anything else
I love Amy so much
Mark got 14/22 right but only 10 out of 23 were real Icelandic candy.
The fact that it took him so long to open is incredible. The banter was just great
Next up is Greenland💀👊
31:37 _Salmiak_ is the best. Not for fellas with weak uncultured tastebuds though. Needs a certain affinity towards all sorts of foods.
Is that the cat that eats people during Christmas? Like the one that cares about children’s fashion?
I could watch Mark review anything and wouldn’t even get close to being bored
The scandinavian countries share a lot of candies
The whistle thing was freaking my dog out 😂
yesss
Captain Marki Sparrow
Whenever Mark was playing the whistle candy, it sounded very similar to Primarina's Cry from Pokemon.
i want to see mark trying mozartkugeln now lowkey
I bet all the licorish are from iceland
bringing back the tide pod challenge? that gum can looked kinda...
❤
So when I was a child in the 90s (I’m 38 as of 1/5/2024😂)  I lived by a drug store (discount drug mart) and they carried those little Jugs of gum powder like that. I loved it 😂
PH logo 26:22
The second one you ate is from Sweden. It said '' Very good from Gränna'' (Gränna is a place in Sweden that make that kind of hard candy)  :)
as an belgian guy i love the chupa chup whistle lolipop
This video is clearly an elaborate Björk reference
😂😂😂😂😂
Mark: Sees Swedish flag Mark: Correctly recognizes Swedish flag Mark: It's Icelandic  🤦‍♂
Yes that was a Swedish flag 6:04
Do they not have maoam in America?? Its all over the UK and I thought it was a fairly universal sweet company
Hockey pulver (hockey powder) is a type of candy in the form of salty-liquorice/licorice powder. It usually contains sugar (socker/soccer), ammonium chloride and liquorice powder.
At least we know that Mark is finally chewing his food 😆
Iceland flag is a blue flag with red cross and white outline around cross and Sweden flag is a blue flag with yellow cross. You should ask PewDiePie for candy from Sweden to review their Candies.
DO NOT JOKE ABOUT RETIREMENT RN MARK PLEASE NO!!
The last candy with chocolate covered liquorice is a brand from Denmark. A guy invented the candy, got rich and sold the company of which could potentially be owned by an Icelandic company(tbh don’t know who owns it now). It’s alright and they many different variants of which is not always liquorice.
If its licorice its probably Icelandic..  I was shocked at just how much I found while I was there years and years ago
I've been waiting patiently for the return of Mark reviews
Mark, if you wrote a sci-fi book, I’d read it Don’t knit why this video made me think of that… “bulbous nodule” probably did it Movie’s way probably enough for you, but man, I’d love to read a book you wrote
Maoam is owned by Haribo (German), but is popular across Europe. Pinballs are also a favourite of mine.
Hubba Bubba had bubble jugs. I remember having them as a kid. It was a favorite needless to say lol
This was the most disturbing video I've ever seen
As a swede my favorite candy is turkish peper and hockey pulver
Most of the candy is of Nordic descent. We do love our licorice. Especially when it’s salty as hell.
Yo play raldis crackhouse
Lately Markiplier’s style kinda looks like he belongs in the walking dead
Spencer spotted!
as someone with Icelandic family I'd like to mention, cats are EVERYWHERE in iceland
finally
This diabetic is: unsubbed. I thought this was an all inclusive channel.
As a Finn, I love you so very dearly Tyrkisk Peber ❤
Am I the only one getting Jack Sparrow vibes from Mark
It's been sooo long since you've done a review video, I'm very excited lmao.
The way mark clapping a mosquito/fly as opening got me. 😂
you look like a pirate
WHY IS EVERY SHOT IN THIS VIDEO SO ZOOMED IN??
Seems like mark might be suffering from a bit of iron lung brain...
The shop next to our school sells the whistles to everyone 😢
9:04 as somebody from the UK, I have never seen this in my life, so please don’t think this is what all British sweets are like 😭. We have some amazing confectionary over here :)  p.s. Maoam Pinballs are so good  Also, I’m guessing the US Food Safety Standards comments was a joke lmao
The commitment to the little jingle that Mark made with the whistle candy is honestly great and funny imo.  Also, the 2nd camera zoomed in on his face is killing me😂😂
Yeah, that 30 seconds after 6:13 is for everyone who forgot Mark is a masochist.
He tried the UFO candies! hell yea
the "chalk" is like coated liquorice filled with mint. I like it.
We had those flute candies 20 years ago in hungary. I loved them so much and they looked the same so I'm sure that is the same  brand
DANG IT NO FNAF
It bothers me that we can’t see the table in the main frame
Can we have a clip of you talking to lixian without lixian editing himself in?
Toot Sweets, Toot Sweets, the bonbon you blow on, the whistle you eat. Toot sweets, toot sweets, the eatable, tweetable, treat~!
they have a third dog!?!?!?!?!
Hiiii
There are cats in Iceland, and people in Iceland  love liquorice
Djöflar literally means devils so do with that what you want
Do UK. I can post you some 😊
Love how Mark just BITES on every single thing 😂😂😂😂
IT’S JUST A THEEOORRYYYY
Well ACKSCHUALY!! ,When i was a kid ,i went to the store and bought a similar item that u didnt consume,It was a Chocolate in a tube similar to a tooth paste tube,and i got poisoned and i started throwin up blood and spent a little bit over a week in the hospital. Ps it was sealed
I love it when he includes Amy in the videos, she really brings out his personality lmao
It's been a while since we've had such a beautifully dumb video from Mark. I am pleased
...That whistling tune thing is going to haunt my dreams I just know it. lol
Hell yea
Okay so why it was so salty No salmiak is very fuckiny salty in the Netherlands we have so many products with salmiak
I spy a spencer at the end!!!
The melody pops is from Spain (I think)
Due to a history of embargoes and restrictions on foreign candies, liquorice was pretty much the only candy available to Icelanders for hundreds of years, so the locals had to get creative.
We use to sell candy slide whistles in the states but kods kept choking to death so we stopped.
crazy coincidence bc i saw that bubbledust for the first time ever today around the time the video was uploaded (i was unable to watch right away lol) and i didnt get it but now i regret cos i couldve tried it at the same time as mark !!!
The best Icelandic candy is nóa Krop I love it
Omg i cant with the whistle candy thing every time he picks another candy man😭😭
Last year Markiplier was John Wick, this year he's Jack Sparrow. The year of the Markiplier
Choquito
my favourite markiplier series returns
45:40
its been so long since a food review or markiplier makes so good to see him back
21:46 i cant with the flute candy melody randomly popping up!
I'm Icelandic and I was shocked to hear that there are no cats in Iceland.
OVER HALF A YEAR SINCE THE LAST REVIEW
You can just hear the Icelandic genuineness of the candy from Mark’s chewing…
Best marky intro 2024
I absolutely lost it when he played the whistle and Henry showed up behind the gate in the background like, "FATHER? DID YOU CALL ME?"
Yay Markiplier Reviews is back!!!  Also I like bulbous nodules.
As an Icelandic person, I'm honored the great Markimoo is reviewing Icelandic candy. But which candy is and isn't authentic? I'll help you with those million dollar questions. Also here's a TL;DR: 8 out of 21 were authentic. Markiplier, what the hell? But thank you for reviewing some Icelandic candy.  1. Authentic. It's a repackaged version of the actual chocolate bar Villiköttur, because of the Christmas season. The repackaged version is named after the Yule Cat. And yes, there are cats in Iceland. Iceland loves their cats.  2. Not authentic, not even from a country that once ruled Iceland.  3. This candy started out as licorice jelly covered in milk chocolate. Very delicious. Then it disappeared for some time and came back as fruit flavored jelly. But the original came back too. Authentic, yes. I love eating little people.  4. Not authentic but the design is one of the more creative packaging designs I've seen.  5. One of my favorites. It's basically a licorice roll with a colored marzipan filling. Lovely combination. Authentic and amazing.  6. I don't know what language that is in but I'm assuming German. Correct me on that if you will. But not authentic.  7. Not authentic either but it's popular in Iceland. I've had it before as well. It's not too bad. It's actually Finnish candy.  8. It's Chupa Chups. Of course it isn't Icelandic but it's still delicious. Doesn't really sound like a whistle though- I never realized it had a slide. Damn it, I'm dumb.  9. Those mushroom shaped marshmallows slap. Not authentic but they're still really nice. I remember getting them as a kid in a "Bland í poka", which means mix in a bag. It's a pick n mix but Icelandic.  10. At this point, I'm convinced that what you were sent is a package full of candies that just happen to be popular in Iceland. Where's the Æði? Or the Hraun? Heck, I'll take classic Icelandic cream chocolate over this salty shit. Not authentic, at all. Also, the sour powder is better.  11. No comment. Not authentic. Next.  12. Oh finally! This is one of the best Icelandic chocolate bars. Never had this version but Eitt Sett (One Set) is amazing. It's a chocolate bar with a licorice strip on top that you can remove and eat separately.  13. Opal is amazing. It's probably the most well known Icelandic candy and the most popular licorice. Although I like lakkrísreimar (licorice shoestrings) better. For real though, the fruit flavored ones are the best fruit flavored candies EVER! But damnit, they're no longer in my country. Although they do come occasionally in the summer.  14. Not authentic.  15. That's Icelandic. Djöflar translates to "Devils". Probably describes why it's so salty. Saltier than Twitter after someone admits they like/dislike something or someone mildly.  16. I've had this before. 9 years ago, I think. It's not authentic but I remember it being alright. I don't remember it being this nasty looking though.  17. This is also very popular in Iceland. Þristur (Triple) is a chocolate bar with nougat and licorice. Very interesting and a nice candy. It's authentic, I can confirm that.  18. Not authentic but popular. It's a very unique taste that not everyone will like and it's not the best candy but I kind of love it. It's interesting.  19. Never had it. Probably never will. Not authentic.  20. Ooh, this is not authentic. And also a thing.  21. I've had this before. It's a fun novelty. It goes surprisingly well with cola. But I think it would taste best with a fruit flavored soda like Sprite or Appelsín (Icelandic orange soda). Authentic.  22. ....Mark Fischback. Next time, when you order Icelandic candy or are in Iceland and want Icelandic candy, do not trust some random guy with it. Get me to help you. I'll help you, Markimoo. Or ask someone else who probably knows more about Icelandic candy than some rando, that's the more likely option. Anyway, not authentic.  Overall, I don't think you're really into Icelandic licorice or candy. But it was really nice seeing you review Icelandic stuff. We don't get much exposure aside from volcanoes, LazyTown, Vikings and Björk.
they did the hockey puck dirty   43:34 ALSO YES.
I just realized, how old is chica? Shes been around for a long time and retrievers live up to 12 years, it hasnt been 12 but it FEELS like it has, this is a very fucked up question but after seeing her in this video that thought just sprung into my head
After the watching the distractible episode where mark talks about this specific video, I’m so glad I get to finally see it😁 glad to know there is no such thing as volcanoes
43:29
I missed those food reviews, and the reviews in general so much. Please Mark, consider making more in the future!
What did Mark mean about Chica's new legs??
Fazer, Finland!
I know what skolekridt is. It's danish for school chalk. Because it looks like the chalk you use on chalk boards. And it tastes worse than chalk.
I loveeeee mark review stuff
Seeing chica in the background look around the corner while mark was playing the whistle was so funny to me. 19:30
Not enough puppy’s playing, very sad :(
"I lick salt"  Me *has POTS*: same, mark... now go talk to your doctor-
He got to the whistle candy and my pups didn't like it lol
I love that you applied your filmmaking skills to this😂 I missed this sort of content❤ Never change, Mark! It's also nice to hear Amy again 😉
"There's no such thing as volcanoes"  Islanders like me: Ahh yes we are actually ocean dwellers
Fazer is a Finnish brand! 🇫🇮 Also it's saalty liquorice powder in the Tyrkisk Peber. Those are my favourite candies
Oh nice, this episode finally dropped! I remember Mark mentioning it in passing on distractible a while back
When he was eating the mint I somehow smelt it for a brief moment
Well Well Well greetings from iceland Mark! 🇮🇸 (I died from laughter at seeing you try and say Icelandic words)
The melody lolly is from the uk, my kids love them and I loved them when I was little. You get a song to play on the inside of the wrapper 😊
Dose anyone know where i can get the candy from 4:36 at online?
As someone who works at a movie theatre and knows what Flavacol is, I'm not surprised that Mark does this 😂😂😂
Poor Mark. 😆
38:20 I have good news, it is not blue licorice.  I have bad news…it’s full of the same thing, that that one was (he sounded so hurt 😭)
I'm Icelandic and live in Sweden and should know some things  1. Jólaköttur. we have cats. we have a candy company with a cat as a logo called Freyja. Is Icelandic  2. It's not grandma. Gränna is a town in Sweden that makes candy.  Not Icelandic  3. Trítlar. You are right about the spooky stories. I realized what death was when i was 6 and had existential crisis. This all because of x-mas.. Is Icelandic  4. The tank of gum powder. Not Icelandic.  5. Stjörnu rulla. (star roll) Is Icelandic  6. Didn't see the packaging, but sounds Swedish. (peppermint with chocolate filling) Not Icelandic (i think)  7. Turkish pepper. From Denmark Not Icelandic  8. lollipop flute by Chupa Chups. from Spain Not Icelandic  9. They are foam mushrooms. Swedish. Not Icelandic  10. Hokey powder is Swedish. Not Icelandic  11. Pinballs. Haribo. German. they are nice. Not Icelandic  12. Súper Sett.  Is Icelandic  13. Opal Is Icelandic  14. Pepparmint, red white. looks like something from Gränna. probably swedish. Not Icelandic (I think)  15. Djöflar (devils) Super salty. Is Icelandic  16. tubble gum. Not Icelandic  17. Risa Þristur. (pronounced THristur in the same th as Three) Is Icelandic  18. Skolekridt. Danish but i see it a lot in Iceland. Not Icelandic  19. Same as 7. Danish Not Icelandic.  20. Frisia UFO candy. Belgium. Not Iceland  21. Lakrísrör Is Icelandic  22. Organic slow crafted balls. Danish. Not Icelandic  Mark scores: 🎉15 correct guesses out of 22 🎉 (unless I'm bad at counting)
god ive missed the review series
Anyone else think he's giving off chaos pirate vibes, or have I just been watching too much OFMD
Marks transformation into captain Jack Sparrow is something to behold
I love playing is it candy or is it licorice, so much fun!!
Tyrkisk peber is a finnish one! Will you visit Finland some day too and try some more candy of ours! You are probably not gonna see this comment. Keep it up Mark. Always enjoy it when a new video drops! 🙏😊
OH MY GOD IT'S BEEN SO LONG. ITS MY FAVORITE OF MARK'S SERIES
The candy whistle reminds me so much of Puppycat
I wonder why marks worn a little handband for the past few videos
Warning I suggest not watch this video with headphones...  Not because of loud sounds just because of disgusting sounds xD
I am absolutely losing it at the whistle pop tune in between each candy hahah
the Jóla candy is Icelandic, it references the Icelandic Jólakötturinn, which is the Yule Cat, a giant cat that eats you if you don't receive new clothes for Christmas. That's why there's a picture of a black cat on the packaging.
You should get a Takis sponsorship...oh wait
At 40:16 mark said “her new legs are coming in nicely” WHAT DOES THAT MEAN??????????? WHAT HAPPENED TO HER FUCKING LEGS?!?!??
Good video as always mark❤️ can u try swedish Candy next time🇸🇪
Does anyone know what's the music Lixian is using for this video?
At 12:30 i thought i would have to choose for him like in his story videos
I love when Mark make this type of videos! It so funny to watch 😂Hope he try other countries candy in the future ❤️
Being from Iceland seeing someone try Icelandic candy is kinda fun
Ooo, I love Djöflar! There’s another one as well which is quite similar, called “Svenskjävlar”!
I’ve missed these style of videos from Mark. This was fantastic. I needed a good laugh today!!
day 25 of asking mark to please play tlou2 <3
I thouroughly enjoyed hearing Mark try to pronounce the Icelandic names of the candies. It tickled my Icelandic heart.
43:49  Chica was like : u gonna share ?! 😅
I really hope these types of videos are back. I've missed them so much haha
2:17 Hi Mark
Having seen people eat some of these candies before...I knew what Mark was getting himself into lol. RIP his tastebuds.
You know, I don't think saying volcano is going to cause an eruption. I live near one and it's been dormant for decades and has shown no signs of...... Uh, what was that shaking sound?
31:44 Demons, Jim!! Demons!!
I can't wait for someone to remix the whistle candy
45:24 is gold
Mark + salmiak = funny faces. 😂
try estonian candy, our chocolate is one of the best
btw norway doesn't have that a with the 2 dots on top but we do have æøå
Flashbacks as soon as I heard the smash or pass music
u doing food agian
Today I learned that Iceland likes licorice.
That intro😅😂
im so happy seeing mark tasting the candy i see everyday, i am currently sick as writing this and having this video to watch makes my day and i am kind of sad i didn't manage to meet you mark, you have been my favorite youtuber for the last 10 years :D
The whistle candy was hilarious 😭‼️
You are my favourite YouTuber mark
I remember those candy flutes from my childhood. They were quite popular among smaller kids and totally nod from Iceland.... even brand logo says :D
And yesterday I was remembering Mark's ADHD toys video. Life's good, man!
the gum in a tube usually has a seal. someone probably squeezed out some, either to smell or taste. had them as a kid on fairs in germany.  also you can tell it's oxidized
Just for reference I googled Is ammonium chloride harmful to humans? Conclusion: Intentional ingestions of dilute ammonium chloride solutions can cause serious injury to the gastrointestinal tract and pulmonary systems, which can result in a complicated and prolonged hospitalization.
tyrkisk peber is danish, it means turkish peber :()
15:51 Actually it's not liqourice it's salmiakki (I have no idea what is the name of that in englis) and inside is powder of salmiakki 🇫🇮 And those are one of my favourite candies 🇫🇮
If only Mark had scissors as hands instead of spoons
Mark playing a candy slide whistle is the best thing I’ve seen this year
I hope Lixian never stops editing for Mark because his editing makes this funny video 100 times funnier 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I just can’t
This is just great! ❤
Mark isn't speaking a language, he's just casting spells
I like ur jacket mark
As a Finn, it's absolutely great to see how much Mark despises the inside of the Tyrkish Peber
Someone teach Mark how to eat hard candies! This is just painful, for me and him too! 😢😟😨
😍 melody pop. Haven't had that since I was little
Mark needs to try some swedish candy now like djungelvral and kexchoklad!
15:00 THATS A FINNISH BRAND A FINNISH CANDY GET YO FACTS RIGHT 😤😤🙏🙏
20:17 kids in a R rated movie be like:
The review god is back
For anyone who's curious, the candy that made Mark go "what the f***" is literally called "demons".
one of those was definitely just good n plentys from a smaller brand
Choco mucho 3:04
Mark:"Thank you chica" Chica:"Huh?"
The second one, Mark said «I’m willing to bet this is authentic”, while there is a whole ass Swedish flag on the packaging 😅
We love Amy
Think he meant to say war heads 15:45
Whenever Amy is behind the camera it takes me back to 2019 unus-annus markiplier extravaganza
Love the random cameo from Spencer 😂
Is it just me or did Mark start twitching like a cat when he tried the Djoflar?
Love that the whistle candy became a transition bit 😂
the european joy I felt seeing tubba gumma I can't
That tube gum thing is another nostalgic one. Its actually pretty good imo
As serious mark says there’s no such thing as volcanos lmao 🤣
hjärtligt gott från Gränna are made i SWEDEN.
Ammonium Chloride is a curing or "drying" salt for when you want to preserve meat. Icelandic people tend to have more of it in their diet because of the national pride, consuming salt-cured fish. So I guess if your body gets used to that much salt, that stuff is like eating coffee beans is to us. Just a food theory. Acquired taste foods.
Mark struggling with opening the packages is the highlight of this video for me. Especially at 28:50, that's how it feels when I struggle to open something
Its some kind of licorace
You mentioned this video on DISTRACTIBLE PODCAST, VIDEO ON SPOTIFY NOW (Lol, why did I do this??)
He can bite hard candy easly but has a hard time with the biscuits from russian mre so how hard was the biscuits?
As an avid hater of licorice, this video has told me to avoid Iceland
15:39 air heads?
Market pliers
Linxian saving the intro for the billionth time😅😊😊😊
I didn't expect Warfstache to come out for a second there at 11:03, lol
La vidéo était génial
@18:26 Wierdly enough, it fits with the a minor Blues/Penatonic scale.
The whole intro is gold 😂
fyi most licorice we eat is candy for fun is candy, but some of the licorice he ate here is actually medicine with the levels of sal and actual licorice plant in them (vs flavoring)
Love that the whistle-tune, turned into a jingle.
Bro. Don’t even know he whant to Sweden that whas vary fased and when is jacksepticy comeing back 😭
Icelandic candy is legit good. 👌
You know it’s going to be a good video when Mark needs four different camera angles when reviewing
It’s like he made this for me to watch while I eat lunch
mark is hot
Yo, why is EddieVR eating Icelandic candy?
😂😂😂😂 that close up cam zoom
I love how Mark's reactions to the different candies are so genuine and entertaining! It's always a joy to watch him try new flavors and see his hilarious reactions.
Me as a Finn raising my hands up when seeing Fazer label 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
lol i love the video but am curious why mark rated them from iceland or not from iceland but never said if they were actually from or not...
mark should eat the most liquorish candy
43:44🙂
As an Icelander who watched this video with his Icelandic family. I can tell you that I was disappointed and my parents insulted him any time he got things wrong.
I need to see the haunted mask now 🤌🏻 also hi Spencer!
You NEED to try Mexican candy next!
SURPRISE SPENCER
Going to Iceland over summer sooo excited
I can imagine Lixian just shit his pants right when Mark was too close to the camera 😂😂.
markiplier
The editing of this video is on par with like big tv studios. Those zoon ins while mark is talking is amazing. It would be a bit better if it's zoomed out by a tiny bit so that his eyes doesn't clip off camera when he moves his head but this is really REALLY amazing in terms of editing.
15:30 have you guys noticed the reflection of the fire on the table? That's some next-level attention to detail
The musical one sounds like the clangers tv series
Today I learned I am a little SKANK for "Icelandic Candy Crunching ASMR".
LOOKING AT THE THUMBNAIL Its so nice to know that Mark has ABSOLUTELY NO BLOOD ON HIS HANDS, IS ABSOLUTELY AND COMPLETLY INNOCENT AND HAS NO CHANCE OF BEING A SERIAL KILLER, NOT EVEN A SPEK OF DOUBT... *okay was that enough to fool mark, also MARK is having his Disney villain arc AND IM ALL HERE FOR IT lol BUT NONETHELESS RUN FOR YOUR FREAKING LIVES, AND RUN LIKE THEY DEPEND ON IT BECAUSE THEY DO, THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS VOLCANOES - Mark 2024 lmao XD* 💀💀💀
Yes Mark. Hjärtligt gott från Gränna is a Swedish candy. The flag is the Swedish flag and Gränna is a famous Swedish city for its abundance of hard candy.
Wait marks in Iceland?
Random thought as someone who reacts to alcohol.  Alcohol free and non alcoholic are not the same thing. And non alcoholic can have up to 0.5%. alcohol free is 0.05%. please be careful
This video is amazing, especially being 3 layers deep into mark's mind.
14:11 Markiplier ASMR
My candie
Tyrkisk Peber is just filled with a powder of salty liquorice and pepper. Not that hard to identify considering it says pepper on the cover of the bag. It's not hot at all, don't understand the marketing, but it's VERY popular. People eat it, flavour liquor with it, make milk-based drinks with it...etc...etc.
My boys had the whistle lolly only yesterday and I straight away regretted buying it for em 😂 I'm from England 😊
If it stands on the paging Nóa siríus or góa it's from iceland and that cat is a Christmas cat that eats naughty children or something on Christmas
monke
Mark is slowly transforming into jack sparrow with each video
As a Finn I'm incredibly proud at how confused and disgusted Fazer's Tyrkisk Peber made Mark 😂❤
Gonna have nightmares with the slide whistle as the theme
34:41 We have this candy in Germany its like gum but really tasty. I just straight up ate it as a child because it loses its flavor pretty quick. And yeah it should have a seal. 😅😂
I love that the tally is not, how good the candy is, it is if it’s from Iceland or not. 😭😭😭
This is just a video of a man being haunted by licorice. XD
damn... he really marking his plier huh?
MARKIPLIER you have to pinky promise you will play poppy playtime chapter 3 when it comes out. Your literally the only YouTuber that does play through i watch
My blood pressure is rising with the amount of licorice
Mark struggling to eat salty liquorice for 49 minutes. The facial expressions are worth it, totally did not let out an evil laugh while watching
No way! New candy review by Markiplier !
Maoam is german (i think)
is it me or did he use jacksepticeye's outro
I would love an edit of Mark talking to Lixian over the years, but Lixian isn't even there. Like, Mark's adventures with schizophrenia
That is the reed whistle noise from twilight princess
OMG MARK I FKIN LOVE YOU! HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR REVIEWS FOR YEARS.... I NEVER COMMENT BUT TODAY IS THE DAY, LETS FKIN GO FOOD REVIEWS FROM THE BEST REVIEWER IN THE BUIS... seoihguno0serngiokasdrgoinasdirgbnsjdf nglsd
MARKIPLIER! get back to work you're out of tune and practice❤
This doesn’t look like the fnaf game so I’m disliking
Im sorry mark but you ate mostly candy not from Iceland
Another review video,  You shouldn't have  (Yes you should have)
I lived in Gränna… im happy that I now learned ive lived in iceland.
what camera was that
It would be a nice send-off for Matpat if you did an episode of your favorite Game Theories. That would be cool if a lot of YouTubers did that and released them the week his last Game Theory is uploaded.
My dogs were so concerned about the melody candy noises
I need the whistle transition by itself.  My phone shall sing.  :3
on distractable (LISTEN ON SPOTIFY) mark mentioned a volcano joke that he made right before a volcano eruption and I was wondering what video it was supposed to be in for so long, funny to see it after having it hinted to.
30:40 . . .well now you have to show us Mark. We need to see the- Show us the mask. Show- SHOW US THE GOD DAMN MASK!!!
Try swedish candy
Pov mark making 50 min long video:  -The video 13%  -The intro 87%
americans: dont do research on what sweets are from where before making videos just because they bought them in a different country...
I LOVE CHICA SO MUCH SHES ADORABLE ❤
THE REVIEWS HAVE RETURNED!!!!!
These are the ones I know about and could see that are not islandic.   The candy at 4:37 is Swedish (as indicated by the Swedish flag, like he said). What is says on the packet roughly translates to " Hearty good from Gränna" (Gränna is a swedish town).  The one at 15:10 was invented in denmark then bought by a finnish company.  The candy at 20:26 is also swedish (again indicated by the swedish flag) and the packet translates to "Rasberry and licorice mushrooms".  At 23:22 a german candy appears.  At 36:34 Another danish candy appears translating to "School chalk".  37:53 same story as the similar one earlier.   40:28 is from the netherlands.   Alot of the other ones seemed like icelandic. At least he tried.
As an icelander i am proud for this video
Wow.  Mark is reeeaally bad at this.
Completely unrelated but is that jacket merch?
Pirate mark 🤭
No fucking way he did candy from my country!
So, some of these are just guesses, some are for sure  1st candy, icelandic 2nd candy, swedish 3rd candy, icelandic 4th candy, UK 5th candy, icelandic 6th candy, icelandic 7th candy, finnish, original danish 8th candy, UK 9th candy, swedish 10th candy, swedish 11th candy, German 12th candy, icelandic 13th candy, icelandic 14th candy, swedish 15th candy, icelandic 16th candy, UK 17th candy, icelandic  18th candy, danish 19th candy, finnish, original danish 20th candy, Netherlands 21st candy, icelandic 22nd candy, danish
as a coeliac, I would NOT survive in Iceland with that amount of Licorice 🥲😂
I think those were smelling salts
"I review icelandic candy" --> "I review Licorice Candy"
Thanks so much for doing another one of these videos I missed them.
I’d love him to try hungarian candy as they are amazing… but if his not careful he might get demonotized for racism XD
Doesnt he live in Sweden?
your melody candy was stopped, its from europe i think (i live in Belgium, maybe its from here idk) btw, there are some melodies  on the box itself not on the paper of the candy itself
Jesus iceland candy looks terrible lol, its like if the great depression was made of sugar
I love lixians editing
Mark indulging in Icelandic candy— and apparently now volcanoes don’t exist! Wow, I never thought I could obtain such knowledge!
E
I don't know if this wil be interesting but mark should try Norwegian candy/snacks (btw the tyrkisk peper and hockey pulver is a pretty popular Norwegian/Swedish candy and drink)
Alternate title “Mark eats liquorice for almost 50 minutes”
20:41 “I’m more mature than I look”  Flashback to the mental age test
did matpat watch this yet bc he needs to
13:00 Did he just say Dutch... Netherlands is not even Nordic, Denmark is Nordic, we are Danes, Danish,.... someone go get the Long Boat, I'm declaring war.
mark being tormented by liquorice, bless
Does he know what happened to matpat
Mark: the odds are a million to one if i hit this i can retire 11:07  Me: Mark Not you too!!!!!!
I found those melody pop thingies in Spain. They are very popular there. My sister loves them to annoy me either them
I dont know why it was so endearing to me that Amy got her own text color lol. after all these years she's got her own color for the captions :)
I love how Mark sometimes gets into deep analyzing a candy and remembering what he saw in the museum and connecting dots and whatnot to decide whether it's icelandic or not, while other times he's just like "nah it ain't icelandic because no"
There's nothing more I love then when markiplier uploads a food review video
Omg the whistle candy is so nostalgic! Been decades since I had one
finally IRL content!!
This makes me want liqourice
A family member just returned from Iceland and brought me a caramel chocolate bar. It tasted like ... licorice?
Ya enjoy the snow markimoo
Licorice, licorice and more licorice 💀
Mark: write in the comments if you think you know what this is me: It's liquorice isn't it
I want to try the one he least liked
Did not even try snort the hockey pulver
Man marks personal trainer is gonna be mad about this one. I wonder what he'll punish Mark with this time
❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂
i'm just here to see what next thing is possibly going to be responsible for mark's next visit to the hospital😁
Plz try Denmark
Swedish and Finnish licorice and candy in general are not made to taste good it’s for when you want to eat something sweet but you don’t have anything other than this at home and it’ll have to make do
Lixian and Amy really are the brains and bones of this channel, Mark has become the showgun of this youtube channel but i think he's okay with that
mark my good sir your nose hairs are awfully long today
2:51 Jólaköttur = Icelandic. (only during Jól event.) 4:17 Granna = Not Icelandic. 6:41 Trítlar = Icelandic. 8:59 Bubble dust = Not Icelandic. 11:29 Stjörnu rúlla = Icelandic. 13:14 Chocolate and peppermint = Icelandic. 14:58 Turkish pepper = Not Icelandic. 18:00 Melody pop = Not Icelandic. 20:16 Swampar = Not Icelandic. 21:50 Hokkey Pulver = Not Icelandic. 23:18 Pinballs = Not Icelandic. 24:30 Super Sett = Icelandic. 25:51 Opal = Icelandic. (Religiously) 28:28 Bismark = Icelandic. 31:14 Djöflar = Icelandic. 33:50 Tubble Gum = Not Icelandic. 35:23 Risa Þristur =  Icelandic. 36:27 Skola Krit = Not Icelandic. 37:44 Turkish pepper, hot and sour = Not Icelandic. 40:25 Frisia = Not Icelandic. 42:06  Lakkrís Rör = Icelandic. 43:24 Athletic Lite = Not Icelandic. 45:39 Slow Crafted = Not Icelandic.
The edited screams undid me 😂
Markiplier is THE best review channel.
markiplier in the senior living home looking around the room asking Lixian for more jell-o (he has become insane)
A whistle sweet? Someone made the tweetable candy from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?! No way! :O
Hi Mark! You should try Polish candy next, they're very delicious :D
"I grew up with tart candy." Sir was dirt tart?
Did he really call the netherlands a nordic country? 💀
What is the music at the beginning?
Am I tweaking or was Spencer (Ethan’s dog) there
I was obsessed with the gum in a tube as a kid, didn’t know it still existed 😂
So most things you are eating are NOT icelandic xD
Last few seconds of the video was the peak of perfection
Mark’s reviews are so hilarious, every single time 😂
as a person who's been living in Iceland for like 10 years, yea their candy is not very good, i'm quite excited to watch this. Also i'm so sad that out of the 3 people that live here Mark didn't meet me :c
Its Captain Mark Sparrow! He soars through the 6 different classes of airspace to find the legendary mysterious island full of whimsical…mystery…and Volcanos!
Just came here to say that the candy your holding in the thumbnail is swedish candy... From gränna
When he bit into the tyrkish peber, aka turkin pippuri, aka turkish pepper, and said "it tastes chemical", he's kinda right! It's ammonium chloride, aka, salmiakki. A gift/candy/punishment from Finland btw 😅
The tyrkisk peber (Turkin Pippuri) are finnish candies,, since its made by Fazer :-) the inside of the candy is most likely just pure salted liquorice powder. Personally i hate it too lol !! just too much when u get to the core of it
I love that the whistle got chica up and moving around to come and see what was going on lmao
I was Today Years Old when I found out Americans don’t have Maoams.
Lemme get this straight. You think we don't have cats because you didn't see a single cat while you were here? That's like saying the USA has no raccoons because my mother and sister have both been there and didn't see any.  Also, Jólakötturinn is named after a famous Icelandic mythical figure - a giant CAT that comes to town in December and eats children that don't get clothes for Christmas.
DANISH CANDY NEXT
Man I miss these so much
I’m from Sweden and almost every candy there was Swedish. And you talked a bit Swedish 😂😂
Grew up in Ohio, but clearly much before Mark, as I remember Melody Pops and my sisters and I loved them.
The amount of times I have binged on Tyrkisk Peber would shock him 😂❤ Hilsen fra Danmark!
Watching Mark react to the few candies I know is quite interesting, that and the fact that he rates them all terribly. Also 23:14, probably not Icelandic from what I know.
I need the candy whistle jingle as a text notification on my phone asap
the length of this video says everything you need to know
His apparel looks like a pirate today, what happened to him on Iceland?
Lixian continues to have the most personality out of anyone on this channel.
Markiplier = Gojo? or is Gojo's ability in Mark's mind?
i've never tasted licorice in my life, and any recearch on what its flavour is was unsucessfull, so this video told me absolutely nothing
im from faroe islands and i can read most of those
Fun fact: Humans, like almost every species capable of a taste receptor, have a special receptor for ammonium salts. It's called OTOP1, and research in mice showed that they avoided water laced with ammonium chloride.
4:41 why does that candy look familiar to me? I feel as if I’ve seen it before, but I don’t recognize it via the name, mainly because I’m American
"I want you to enter my mind" followed by some random video needs to become a meme
Mark sounding like a Clanger from The Clangers 19:48
I love listening to a man spread misinformation while I crochet
I mean, Iceland literally has a story of a cat that eats people who don’t get new clothes for Christmas, so cats have some part in Iceland
So much Swedish candy 😅
you should try finnish candies! couple of these were already finnish like the tubble gum and the tyrkisk peber
Try danish candy
Why is mark slowly turning into Keanu reeves if he was Jack Sparrow...
I love the little whistle
I MISSED IRL MARK VIDS LETS GOOOOO
Why did I think the channel name said Mouldy Butter
I miss Unus Annus. 🖤🤍 I feel like this is the closest content we’ve seen in awhile
Why does mark know what a packing peanut tastes like?
That is indeed the Swedish flag on that candy at 5:50 I can tell as I'm Swedish ^^'
So mark and amy watch Ethans dog sometimes?
A food theory 😢 I’m gonna miss mat lol
Mark you should play Lempo. Its a horror game based on Finnish Mythology and i think you would like it very much.
That whistle has a supprisingly nice sound to it
“Iceland has no cows 🐄 ”   - Mark 2024
It's not spicy flames, it's chemical burn flames
38:51 "i don't know what you are,but you're not hot" from Markiplier itself to a unknown thing
The whistle sound is my gem in this video😂😂 hope lixian keeps on using it
The second candy that he tried is from sweden
Oh to be a camera being given a pep talk by Markiplier himself.
watch your ass, santi, mark's coming to take your job
Finnish candies next.
I enjoyed this video a lot. Thank you, this made my day :D
MARKIPLIER WAS IN ICELAND!? I WISH I MET HIM WAHHHH
I MISSED THIS KIND OF CONTENT. WHEN IS MARKIPLIER MAKES?? :(
I guess Iceland really likes salt and licorice?
He only got 9 actual icelandic Candy's kinda sad that his guide couldnt point him towards original Icelandic Candy's we have alot of good ones here
SPENCER!
oh boy! a review video to spend time with as i contemplate the current state of my life in its entirety! here's another comment in the sea. 🤟  the look of.. pain? at 16:15 man.. really felt that in my soul.  19:06 yeah. yup! i want 20 of these.  the jacket & headband look.. especially the jacket.. so cool.. this is why i dream of having that confidence & sense of self. do i want to Be, or just Be Like in the sense that there's a vague sense of kinship to a stranger? how much sense am i not making? cool. ok!  i want to attempt being sent to the maleficent mind of markiplier. now i know i would be playing an annoying melody whistle candy. that would be fun. until it wasn't? how would i know?   good to notice lixian & amy present 🌹 oh please pet those puppers for me today? i am asking yet again, for the pups.❤
Lol this is just all nordic candies, not just Icelandic. Ännu mer skoj att det genast slutade bli isländskt rakt vid andra godissorten.  Anyway, I'm writing here to say that as a swedish-speaking Finn, I just internally died from the way he first pronounced "Fazer" on the turkish peppers. Ja kommer int nånsin att förlåta dig Mark!
ah so THIS explains why the last Few weeks of videos have been  only Lethal Company and Fnaf Help wanted 2
mark chewing a type of candy that you're meant to keep in your mouth for a while. yep that's a Mark thing alright
The little whstle lolli jingle is awesome, I love how it just becomes common after its invention
GRAHHH SWEDEN MENTIONED(GRÄNNA)🗣️
I wanna see him taste some swedish candy cuz im fro IKEA-Land
We have jerry can gum in Canada as well. I had it a lot in Canada when I was a wee little dickhead.
The sounds of the slide whistle, a.k.a., Iceland’s wind chime
We need a series! Trying out candies from different countries! We have korea,and now iceland
Ight, im swedish ok? the rasberry/licorice one is swedish, yes thats the swedish flag, the package said "heartly good from Gränna" (mby dont sounds too good but its directly translatess soo) an "Gränna" is a place, thats just the name, ur welcmoe, ik uall care :) also, high chance many of the others are also swedish, we hav those here aswell, especially the salty and the licorice ones, and finally thats not a nipple? its obviously a chanterelle, ty
YES FINALLY A REVIEW VIDEO LOVE YOU MARK
Was that Spencer.???
Wait what happened to Chica?
American chololate is just chemicals
That was definitely one of the intros of all time.
I'm eating lunch while watching this, now I want candy (I'm not the type of person to want to eat sweets)  time to go to iceland😭😭
As a Swede who hates hockey Pulver watching markiplier hate it aswell makes me laugh for no reason😭
The second one is Swedish. Grenna is a small town in Sweden. Really don’t know how they mixed something like that up…
Usually when I think of Iceland I think of Lazytown, but this video has opened my mind. Now when I think of Iceland I will think of Lazytown AND licorice
Turkish pepper is Swedish. Not Icelandic.
27:29 that scream though as if it was trying to escape from mark 😂
I lol'd at the candy "nipples", that's what we jokingly call them in Finland. I even eat them the same way by biting off the nipple XD
the lamb's head thing i'm fairly certain is actually Norwegian. might just be scandinavian in general though
Mark saying the Food Theory outro was glorious.
The extreme candy “djöflar” is a literal translation of “devils”. I dont know á single icelandic person (except my extreme liqourish fanatic mom) who likes those
How are is Togei? I is gus. Hahahahaha
FINISH HW 2 FFS
“What do you means it’s a little close 👁️👄👁️”
This video should be called "Markiplier dying for almost 50 minutes" 😂
A volcano just erupted in my bedroom. Mark, I gotta sue you now
Does anyone know what the filling was in the 'spicy' sweets?
I miss crackhead mark
The fact i've eaten half of these and have never been to Iceland is amusing
9:05 Fun (ish) fact; They're named Jerry cans, because that design is what the German troops (Jerries) used to transport fuel in WW2. The U.S. and U.K. forces transported fuel in completely square cans, and well, those had a problem. The hard squared off edges of the Allied forces fuel cans got bent and broke at the seams all the time, so they eventually adopted the design as well.  Also, about the Ammonium Chloride. It has got the same problems as regular salt, it raises your bloodpressure. My old team-leader's husband had heart problems, and he once he was staying in a room with a young dude. And this dude had extremely high bloodpressure. Like, "OMG, why has your head not exploded!?!" high. And the doctors could not figure out why. He was in good shape, young, normal cholesterol, and exercised regularly.  Turns out, he worked at the local Haribo factory, and his favorite candy was salty licorice. And, when you work there you can eat as much as you like off the line. So, when he stopped eating the licorice, his BP went down to normal levels.
The second thing you tasted was indeed swedish. I'm from Denmark and the fact I could understand what was on the bag just screams that it's swedish bc I have no idea what Icelandic text says 💀
mark has blessed us once again with another of these kind of videos. ty mark
Was that spencer!?!?!?
my earth hurts so much after seeing the prices
Ammonium chloride is the main ingredient for salmiac licorice 😃That's why it's listed as an ingredient for so much stuff you tried there.
Really happy you tried some of my favorite candies (half of these are in Sweden as well, where I live)
Mark trying to read the *SWEDISH* text on the "Hockey Pulver" candy is really funny to me. He had very mixed opinions on the Swedish ones 😂 Almost every single licorice one was Swedish. Him calling the *SALTY* licorice "Salty hell" fits with the name. "Djöflar" is a changed version of "Djävlar" which means "Devils".
The jingle sounds a lot like something from Squid Game, guess your Korean roots go deep
It's funny because the city in Iceland got a little eruption from a 🌋 only one person has gone missing
5:05
18:27 I have not seen one of those since the 90s, where the hell that been at?.. oh shit
5:12
Tyrkisk peber is a finnish candy, from Fazer. There’s salty licorice powder inside and the outer part is salty licorice as well. It’s called salmiakki in finnish. I love those, been eating them since I was a child.
I don’t know what you are, but you’re not hot. - mark
11:03 mark almost accidentaly turned into Wilford there for a second-
i don’t think i’ve ever been this early to a markiplier video except iswm
MARK LET ME OUT OF YOUR MIND PLEASE!?!
The entirety of Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland cringing at Mark's distaste for salmiac liquorice
Chica appears in the background at certain times in the video. It's a missed opportunity not to have written "feat Chica" in the title  Edit: Chica appears in the foreground near the end of the video
The fakt that they have a lort of danish candy in Iceland isn’t all that surprising. After all, Iceland was once under the danish kingdom. No the surprising thing is, that peaple tent to forget that Danmark is indeed a part of Scandinavia.
2nd saying this btw
I'm annoyed you came to Iceland and I missed you. Was there an event or something?
Each time I hear that whistle 😂
Captain Jack sparrow faces
I love these videos
Mark's hair is giving me so much gender envy.
Turkish peppers are so yummy! From Finland 🇫🇮
Someone needs to make a remix of Mark's candy jingle 😄.
I can't wait for the "I'm in hospital" post in the next few days.
So ammonium chloride is edible but...  Its used to make dry batteries Its literally made up of ammonia And even dilute ammonium chloride can cause serius injuries to your gastrointestinal tract & pulmonary systems, also can make your bodily fluids acidic if you overdose....  (Aint that some fun facts)
As an Icelandic, liquorice is everywhere and I have no idea why        Also there are cats in Iceland...
YIPPIE MARK AKNOWLADGED ICELAND
would love to see a review with amy trying them with you if she’s down
Captain Mark Sparrow is eating Icelandic candy…😂😂😂
“Does Iceland have cats?”- Markiplier 2024
The Tim and Eric food sounds are a real nice touch. Marks instrumental for the upcoming Iron Lung Movie is going to be a great addition, really adds to the drama, bloop up bloop down.
49 and a half minutes of mark ranting about some random subject while eating some random food nobody has heard of? SIGN ME UP!
How many times or how long has markiplier brushed his teeth after this
Waiting for the Icelandic person to confirm Mark's choices
Markiplier do you Support palestine
❤
We used to snort hockey pulver when we were kids back in the days xD
i have had that GUM!!!!!!!! before
I miss his review videos and it's good to see Mark doing it again, brings back memories
What happened to chica
A volcano killed me when I heard the volcano bit
I didn't know until this video that I needed salty and chocolate covered licorice in my life.  I love licorice and didn't know these were a thing!
Melody Pops! I did a happy cheer when he finally blew hard enough to make a tune. I used to have them when I was young. Im from the UK and this was a very popular sweet. Imagine the chaos of about 3 or 4 kids with these all playing them at once. This was pure nostalgia for me.
Can you make more videos on grounded there is WAY more content and quests
So good thank you for eating weird candies, you are the number one candy review channel on YouTube 💕💕💯💯
Mark tries Icelandic candies = Mark tries 6 Icelandic candies XD  But I didn't know Mark was in Iceland recently!!!! WHAT!! <3 <3
He's looks Icelandic
Another review video! Let’s gooooooooooooo.
Ive been waiting for the next markiplier review lol
As an Icelandic, I’m going to go over which candies are and arent icelandic, (to my knowledge) Some background info, Iceland is known for making good licorice, and from my experience icelandics either love it or hate it. I’m a bit inbetween. We also, or at least i do and some others i know, love salty, that salty coating mark ate is my favorite part of those candies, love the salty essence.  First candy 2:49 : Jólakötturinn, which translates to the christmas cat, was in fact icelandic candy. Very typical icelandic candy. And yes we do have cats in iceland. We have a lot of them .. the christmas cat is a part of our folklore  Second candy 4:28 : My personal favorite, I’ve always know them as fifty-fifty but they aren’t actually the fifty-fifty brand candy (or so i think), from my knowledge it is icelandic.  I have never bought them in a bag like mark had since we have an isle in our grocery stores called “Nammiland” which is just “candyland” where u can choose ur candy shovel it in a bag and pay for the weight of the candy.   Third candy 6:46 : it’s made by NÓA (nói siríus) which is an icelandic candy company, and yes it is Icelandic. Pretty typical gummy with the white thing on it. 6:54 it says “Crazy good. Double layered fruitgummy”  Fourth candy 9:01 : like mark said it says its from England, and ive honestly never seen that thing, so i pretty sure its not Icelandic  Fifth candy 11:31 : Very typical and traditional Icelandic candy, no doubt about it.  Sixth candy 13:26 : didnt really get a good look at the label, but i think it is Icelandic candy, kinda typical icelandic candy.  Seventh candy 15:10 : i know it says turkish pepper, but to my knowledge it is a danish candy. Its supposed to taste like black pepper i think, idk i never really liked it.  Eighth candy 18:06 : wrapper looks like its from another country, ive seen icelandic candy like that one, so I’m not sure but i think it is icelandic.  Ninth candy 20:19 : looks like icelandic candy to me so I’m going to say its icelandic. Idk why they make them nipple shaped so dont ask  Tenth candy 21:53 : its swedish, the name hocky pulver is literally swedish. Pulver being the swedish word for powder.  Eleventh candy 23:20 : idk about that one, i know we might make candies like those, ive had a lot of them. But I’m not sure if their icelandic.  Twelfth candy 24:37 : made by NÓA so its Icelandic  Thirteenth candy 25:57 : ÓPAL is icelandic. I never liked them, there are two brands that make this candy (honestly might be the same company) Tópas, obviously referring to the gems, seems like mark got a gimmicky one, they are typically just the black licorice, and i think ur supposed to suck on them. They honestly might have a box of these in the museum.  Fourteenth candy 28:35 : looks like homemade or old fashioned candy. Its icelandic, but i think it might be a universal candy.  Fifteenth candy 31:29 : its made by FREYJA so its icelandic, typical super salty outside, i love the saltiness, would have thought mark liked it given that he likes salt. Name on the package is “Djöflar” which is “devils”  Sixteenth candy 33:53 : honestly no idea, i dont think its icelandic but i could be wrong.  Seventeenth candy 35:29 : Þristur, <þ> pronounced <th>ristur  which is a word for threes, i dont think it can be directly translated. Its definitely Icelandic  Eighteenth candy 36:34 : the package is in danish or swedish, that particular one doesnt look icelandic, but i know for a fact we make candy like that. So its typical icelandic, but that particular one he has looks foreign.  Nineteenth candy 37:48 : already mentioned, danish candy.  Twentieth candy 40:26 : ive known these candies as jesus bread, put em in ur mouth and suck the dry part and it pretty much instantly dissolves to reveal whatever they chose to put inside. I dont think they’re icelandic. Just googled it, its from the netherlands  Twenty-first candy 42:25 : licorice straw, most definitely icelandic  Twenty-second candy 45:48 : i know cheaper versions of this candy is made by icelandic companies, not sure about the one he bought though. They are heavenly though. Insane how good they are  That’s it, i might have been wrong on some of these. But as an Icelandic, i think i got them all right
If Markiplier thinks thats the saltiest thing, he hasnt had salt fish yet and i think that should be its own video :D
There a lot of cats in iceland😂
Funny thing about the whole volcano bit... you might want to look up what was happening in Iceland around the time this video came out. 😅
I like Candy.
my god, im swedish and I love the licorice annd raspberry combo!
most of them are swedish including the Turkish Pepper also idk if iceland only has licorice but im pretty sure has others too
This is a weird version of help wanted 2 part 13 🤣
Ive always loved these videos but knowing the candy he is tasting lifts the whole thing to a new level. You guys have no idea just how fucking salty those things are
23:38 the other candy still being there shouldnt have been so hilarious to me
Gosh i missed these!
21:45 thank you mark this really helped because I have a singular nipple in the middle of my chest like iron man
I thought America has moams?
We sure do like our raspberry-liquorish here in the north. We got candy, ice-cream, and even soda. We also love salty candy, esp just eating pure ammonium chloride, like the hockey puck. That's what makes the salt-liquorish taste. Its not liquorish at all, ammonium chloride just tastes like "salty liquorish". So technically its false marketing to call ammonium chloride for liquorish. Its just used because its cheaper, and real liquorish is toxic and a few people actually die from overconsumption every year.
The fact she was warning Mark about what if there's a potential disaster only proves the point that Mark is a reality manipulator...
12:35 is going to be memed so hard😭😭😭😭
I was just watching the “Markiplier reviews stuff” playlist and was about to complete it, and he dropped another one, lesssgooo
I hate licorice so I would die in iceland if i had to eat icelandic candy... EVERY. SINGLE. THING. IS. LICORICE.
Iceland is worth it.
This has been so funny, but I also feel so bad for Mark lol. Poor bastard ate chemicals and salty salt salt😂😂😂 also that is a lot of licorice!!
good video but it could do with some more liquorice
Tyrkisk peber "turkinpippuri" we call it. One of most Finnish products ever 😅
I'm still waiting what's from Iceland and what isn't... 🙂
OMG..! A REVIEW VIDEO FROM THE KING OF REVIEW CHANNELS...
I hate hockry polver and  i'm swedish
It’s still a bit of a sore subject, please don’t joke about retiring mark, we can’t lose you as well ❤
loving the icelandic markiplier lick
I missed this series so much
wow, lixian really went all in on this one. I'm wondering how much time did it take
refreshing to see lixian's lil character in a markiplier vid after some time. their interactions with each other are always entertaining.
yet another video where im not sure mark took his adhd meds the day of filming
Opal truly is the candy of our people
Why won’t food companies give this man a DAMN SPONSORSHIP
market plier
This week has been very hard for me. This video helped me cheer up a little, thank you Mark.
Nice video that you made chica❤
Hi
The first candy looks so much like a Lion from Nestlé.
"This is the tale...of Captain Mark Sparrow!"
Marklplier is just dead inside because of the all of these candies.
The salt thing is because american salt is actually a lot of sugar...
Please try Swedish Candy
I live in iceland
Watching Mark make disgusted faces while trying my favorite candies is just hilarious 😂
Lol not surprised Mark didn't like the black turkinpippurit (the tyrkish peber candies) XD Not many people outside Finland do. The hot and sour ones are my favourite. But thanks for trying it~ Suomi mainittu, torilla tavataan!
Tyrkisk pepper is FROM DENMARK :)
I feel spoiled when mark posts multiple times in a row
So the unidentifiable taste you are describing is really coming from that ammonium chloride. It is the main taste of that specifically salty type of liquorice called salmiak/salmiak 🖤
Ammonium chloride is a popular flavouring in licorice so it's not surprising that it's in so many of the candies XD
Wow
I love how at 26:56 he bites into the next little candy you hear the “crunch” followed by Marks face of complete and utter betrayal.
OMG YES I LOVE MARKIPLER REVIEWS ❤❤❤
when was he in iceland did i miss smth
22:30 hockey pulver is the bane of my existence (tasted it once when i was a kid and never again, fun to see in stores when i know noone likes it) and sorry to say thats norwegian on it
Omg I’m special and mark loves me. 😂
"I'm more mature than I look." No sir, that statement is backwards. It should be "I'm not as mature as I look." There, I fixed it.
Markiplier should clearly replace Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean movies :D
as an Icelandic i’m excited to see where this goes…🫡🇮🇸
thats a lot of liquorice wow
Mark pronouncing these names is making my furniture run and dance around the house.
im sorry mark, the grandma one is swedish
Every time I heard that whistle it reminded me of the Clangers
Tyrkisk peber is finnish candy😊
Lol as an American in Europe, mark freaking out over tubble gum not having a seal made me realize I have stopped paying attention to how Europeans package their candies
Was that Spencer!?💗
The second one, from Sweden - soo yummy! :D
as an authentic Icelander I cannot even begin to explain how stoked I was to see this in my recommended
The sheer amount of effort Mark must put into his videos to not miss an upload is genuinely insane.
I love being able to see candy from my home country too, Denmark! The minty white and red hard candy you had is from exactly where I live.😂 AND SKOLE KRIDT, which translates to school chalk!
He’s a sweet boy.
I wish mark would bring back the MARKIPLIER TRIES SERIES
Many of the stuff were from sweden, but I think that most scandinavian countries have very similar candy output
6:25 My face when i feel something crunchy in my soft food.
I'm from the UK and have NEVER heard of that weird gum thing, definitely just manufactured in the U.K but we don't eat it lol
Mark trying to say icelandic words sound like some harry potter spell - 6:48
I love that he barely looks at the bags. They could easily look at where it's made on the back of the bag to get the answers
I mean ... I'm from the UK and I've never in my life seen Sneaky Bubble Dust, so...
I was waiting for this to come out ever since he talked about it on Distractible a few weeks ago
Mark's outfit here is very stylish! I am now trapped in a mindscape forever lol. great video :)
gotta have the licorice straw with a coke XD
*WE LOVE THE COMPANY*  Oh wrong video
The last candy is from here in Denmark, chocolate covered licorice, super popular and really yummy, but like mark said the brand is so freaking expensive!
These are my favorite types of videos that mark makes. I want so much more
the second one has the Swedish flag mark
ASMR from Markiplier is satisfying
I don't know why mark is worrying about audience retention in the first place, the intros are the best part!
Chaotic as always
Im dying in laughter
5:02 : ☹️😯🗿😮🤨😔 6:34 : “ooOhHhnnNaA”
I recently rewatched the videos where Mark reviews food so I'm glad to see another one after all this time!
The finns are gonna be so mad for Mark dunking on turkinpippuri💀🙏
7:39 every time I hear a sentence like this I get reminded of Hans Nienmann LMAO
I thought Melody Pops were an Australian thing…apparently not
As someone who is not from Iceland I approve of this
later on, he just starts speaking sim language.
you should read audio books. Your voice is so soothing
As a dane, the fact that Danmark wasn’t even mentioned in this video, even though his favourite candy was from Danmark, hurts me deeply </3
46:02 it’s so funny when you know what’s in it from the start and just see him get disappointed
so now we know mark doesn't like salmiakki
A Markiplier food review 😮
Anyone else from Iceland?   👇
I guess I shouldn't be surprised since you've been nerding out over lenses but wow is the camera quality nice in this video
🧛‍♂️
i would love to see him try middle eastern candy/chocolate
Next episode Mark reviews folklore stories
seeing people eat salmiakki (don't know what it is in english) for the first time will never not be funny
Hjärtat från gränna is from sweden. Gränna is a place in sweden that makes polka candy
I hope these things are not drugs
1:51 Oh God. Please. Darkiplier is that you? I feel like it's 2019 again
i missed the review videos i love this
the production quality on this is insane
The ammonium chloride mentioned in the salty licorice candies is actually THE salty licorice, also known as salmiac. It's the same stuff that's insife the Tyrkisk Peber ones! Gosh I love it, but I understand it can divide opinions😂  Here in Finland we made it ourselves in chemistry class in school years ago, since it's pretty easy to make. :D
FINNISH CANDY
Not me fangirling over that Denmark won…
Why does he look like a pirate... he's like "how do I look?" Markiplier Sparrow?
Is uncanny how much Markiplier is opening his eyes
mark had flashbacks of that mask..
ammonium chloride is used for dry batteries soldering and fertilizer
Seeing marks face do...that when eating tyrkisk peber... yeah that's the basic experience (it's a danish candy, but tyrkisk means turkish so like. dunno the roots, i just know its the thing kids dare each other to eat and it tastes terrible)
Long time since we've had a review video, as whacky as always. Mark never fails to be hilarious.
so funny! I missed this kind of video!
15:20  aaaah Finland 😎😎🇫🇮🇫🇮🇫🇮 TORILLE
Mark looks nice in a headband I think you should keep the look
Tyrkisk pepper is one of my favorite candies and I had a good laugh watching mark taste it :D
Like this comment if Mark should check out Romanian candies
Man I really enjoyed this video had me laughing up a storm 😂 But guys are you with me on this I would so love the Melody Pop tune as a text tone notification sound it’s so catchy and I love it 💜 P.S. If someone could please make that for me that would be great
That powdered gum also is here in Canada. That company also makes this Candy gel that had a CHOKEHOLD on me last summer
I wonder what Alex is going to think about all this Candy Mark ate.
"Plane...air...skys.."
Review Swedish candy, we have the BEST candy, especially chocolate.
Dutch? Dude, the Netherlands isn’t a Nordic country
The reviews returnnnnnnn
Lixian has to make a game about that scary red human candy
Man is really become the new Mr Worldwide. Mr World Mark if you will
Ill taik icelandic rn ég er ívan markplier ég er mamma þin
liquorice is super, super gross.
the 2nd candy had the Sweden Flag so No it not from Iceland edit never mind he saw it
I love how Mark sounds like a genuine food critic and takes this whole thing serious. It gives the video that extra flavour ya know?  19:01 lol we have a similar type of candy in the netherlands. Not the exact same though. its the same lickable candy but it's like hidden in/on a little plastic flute. The flute barely works and the candy tastes like ass, but theyre so much fun.  Mark's reaction to what i assume is just salmiak flavour (salty kinda liquorish stuff i cant rlly describe it) is hilarious. It's also funny to see that so many candy in this video is also sold in the Netherlands. our candy is very similar. Lots of licorish stuff, sweet, salty, salmiak. i recognise those ufo candies as well as others.
This was chaos, and I appreciate it. 😂
That whistle tune that plays before each candy kills me every time
Ngl, the jingle he came up with for between candies actually goes hard
1st one reminds me of a 100 Grand Bar
Ive been waiting for you to make more reviews, theyre my favorites
mark I need a refund you didn't send me out of your mind like in the beginning of the video
We have Maoam in germany, I don't know if it's a german brand though. I think I have actually seen the pinballs before.
"Any other nordic country such as Sweden... Norwegian... Dutch..."  *cries in denmark* (this is a joke)
i clicked on this after watching the sour patch kid video and i was like haha when was this posted. TODAY?
OOOOPLA
as a flag "connoisseur" I can say with a 100% certainty, that it is the Swedish Flag....you are welcome...I'll go home now..*puts nerd glasses on*
wait, since when are airheads spicy?
I had melody pops but they were a thing in the 80os and 90os, so I don't if that's just old candy or it continued production. I miss them.
Markiplier explaining my childhood with the horrible for your body Pixiesticks and other junk used to shoot them up our nose as kids bc we were stupid kids
voe turkkkari... u tried ur best. the package does not sell u so well<//33
I know for a fact that the bubble dust is not Icelandic because I’ve had that here in the states
Solid Snake Markiplier.
any counted how many times mark said licorice ?
ngl that flute lolly thing looked fun as hell. idgaf if it tasted like cement and uranium i’d absolutely buy that shit
the salty candies were a sign that mark needs to move on from the weak and pathetic sodium chloride and go to the next level salt that is ammonium chloride
I love seeing Spencer, Chica and Henry playing.
Anyone else check to see if that actually was the flag for Sweeden 5:52
Whistle sounds doomish
We used to have those bubble dust cans here in Canada years ago!
Polish honey next?? Bets part about honey is that it won't go bad in your lifetime :)
“Don’t consume a lot of ammonium by choice” *flashbacks to drinking pee in [REDACTED]* 23:09
The Maoam Pinballs are also in Poland (where I live) and I also really love that candy.
Mark saying it's just a theory, a food theory litteraly made me smile so hard.
you should try greek candy!!!! + love your videos
I know what it is
That hockey candy is so sweetish, not even funny  It's just pure salt, and licorice
Try Romanian next
Mark: "I want you to enter my mind." Me: "No, thanks. I'm afraid of what I'll find."
northern languages ​​according to Markiplier: Swedish, Norwegian and DUTCH😂😂😂😂😂😂
They acting like we ain't used to Marks nonsensical intros that go nowhere
31:29 Djöflar literally translate to Devils. So when you say it's salty as hell, ya ain't far off. 🤣
Nordic ppl who LOVE salty licorice/salmiak 👇
Swedes love their licorice :D  They even have licorice for people who don't like licorice!
What is with Iceland and licorice?
dude i was rewatching mark's reviews series and suddenly this popped up. I FEEL CALLED OUT!
48:08  Spenceeeer ☺🥰❤❤❤❤
Am I the only one confused about spencer (Ethan's dog) being there? Just me?
I was listening to this, and I heard "Swedish" and I looked over and saw the Swedish flag, and I'm just like "Wait, isn't this reviewing Icelandic candy?" I'm also learning Swedish so hearing you try to pronounce the name was pretty darn funny.
I’m Icelandic but I’ve never been there so this will be interesting to watch
Bro I just woke up and I was NOT ready to be cast inside Markiplier's mind 3 TIMES 😖
Is it really a markiplier video if he doesn't redo the intro several times but doesn't edit them out? (Gotta love him for that)
Iceland mentioned!
MARKIPLIER REVIEWS
*swishes candy in mouth and spits content out like takis*
0:11 Twin towers 0:18 never mind
*chews* ÆNWÆNS-"
43:42- 43:49 HE CANT SAY THAT, ITS TAKEN ALREADY!!!!!
Amy trying very hard to stop Mark from getting cancelled 😂
*Happy Amy noises*
This is so intriguing.. tell us more
Definitely miss Mark putting out vids everyday, and I can't wait to see his new 80's hair metal band. Or Marks secretly Snake. We'll go with that.
when he pulled out the maoam pinballs i knew it'd be good
so happy about him being in Iceland cause its where I want to live.  (also the possible maybe foreshadowing of the volcano eruption is really funny)
Ammonium chloride is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula NH4Cl. It is a white crystalline salt that is highly soluble in water and mildly acidic. It is also known as sal ammoniac and is used in various industries, including as a nitrogen supply in fertilizers and as an electrolyte in dry cells. In veterinary medicine, it is used to prevent urinary stones in sheep, goats, and cattle.
I had double salt licorice, and it was the worst thing that I have ever consumed. It has salt, ammonium chloride, and tasted like cleaning chemicals after the face-shriveling amount of salt.
IVE MISSED THESE KINDS OF VIDEOS SM
SPENCER WAS ONE OF THE DOGS GOING OUTSIDE I REPEAT SPENCER WAS THERE
Noice focus pulling! CANDY!!!!
Just gonna answer it a bit, Socker is just the swedish word for sugar(icelandic word for it is Sykur)
apparently ammonium chloride is in dry batterys
This really made my day ^.^ Thanks Mark for your unapologetic superb self <3
as a Swede, I am offended thanks Mark
THE CLOSE UPS OF THE NOSEHAIR I CAN'T XD
He has moved on to other countries, my fellow Canadians we missed our shot to force feed him poutine
We have the stroo licresh in EGYPT 🇪🇬
You should get Lixian to send you candy form Portugal, and then he can scream at you every time you say it's not Portuguese
24:19 Maoam is actually a German candy, not Icelandic. Really good candy though, I can't ever figure out where to get it here in America.
I can’t stop laughing 😂
This warmed my heart watching mark enjoy some of iceland candy but so sad that i missed out on meeting him while he was here in iceland.
Mark, after your movie, you aren't gonna leave btw, right?
Was anyone else trying to Google translate all these just to see if it was Icelandic or not? XD
tyrkish peber's from Finland
Nooo the red one... is supposed to be raspberry or strawberry 😅
that mosquito was annoying
iceland has lots of salt because they need salt to keep their ice from melting
Next go and try feroes soda 🇫🇴🇫🇴🇫🇴
Can you eat Turkish 🇹🇷 food or snack pls
Would using Google translate to verify the language, take the magic out of the guessing?…probably
wait yall dont have maoam in murica? btw its "mah-oh-ahm" and I'm not from Iceland
THEY DONT HAVE MOAOM IN AMERICA?!?!?
Mark must look like a schizophrenic when he does the lixian bits prior to lixians edits
How can you not like licorice
When we were kids we would just shove our entire tounge into the hockey pulver box😅
Another dog appeared
I love gummies... I'm a addict.. well i have no more to add😂
I have POTS and I am now so curious about Icelandic candy lol
MY FAVORITE MARKIPLIER SERIES IS BACK HELL YEAH
i've missed these review videos so bad now i remember why i miss them xD
this makes me want icelandic candy
I love Tyrkisk Peber ❤ It’s Liquorice caramels with powder inside, the powder contains salmiac, liquorice and pepper :) so no, it ain’t spicy, but it’s quite ‘salty’ 😅
Please for the love of god don't try out the norwegian candy or chocolate mark. You will regret it😭
As an Icelander: Icelandic candy is nuts and we can't make good chocolate. Enjoy. (Liquorice with chocolate tastes amazing tho) Also every candy is filled and thats the one thing i hate about it
Only  Lixian could make this super hilarious! 😆😆
OML, I haven't thought about the slide whistle candy since I was a little kid. Sudden memories of playing with one of those and getting sent outside to stop annoying the adults. wonder if you can even buy those things anymore without going to a specialty candy store where I live.
I missed those videos so much! Please, do more of these!
huh, screw me for thinking maoams were global I guess lmao
Mark, play NMS its right up your ally
why is he torturing himself with those Peber candies
Mark putting a candy in his mouth and initially enjoying or thinking he knows the flavor, only to then turn around and cheerfully go "nope" put me in tears 😂
Markiplier reading these names is like simlish and I'm here for it. XD
Mark's candy eating ASMR.
Norwegian candy?
Icelandic people must really love licorice.
You broke it😂
TEETH, JUST USE YOUR TEETH TO  GET THE OPENING GOING! A thin plastic bag isn't going to break your teeth
XD Chica just appear in the right corner to see what is happening 19:06
The salty candy at 31:16  was my favorite candy as a kid (still is tbh) and the reaction is so relatable it’s kinda disgusting how salty it is but i just can’t get enough of it
maoami pinballs are so fucking good
Most of the candy he has reviewed had nothing but licorice in them.
Short and quick but mark makes it 50 mins
Skoll krijt translates to “school chalk” and its one of the few true licorice candies I like.
Every time he does one of these he ends up in the emergency room.
Deep despair and salty liquorice 😂😂
i missed markiplier reviews, hes such an idiot, in a good way.  this intro was so unhinged
Jelly baby that needs help
As a Swede, I can confirm that the second candy in this video wasn’t Icelandic. It’s Swedish
I love how he says "They don't have american food safety standards" Yeah, so those are like among the worst in the world lol they have MUCH better standards Mark
Can we talk about how mark kinda looks like he be jack sparrow or just me
She sounds hot
I think Mark should review some pliers
It's been so long since I've seen Mark's whole face, omg (I've been binging Help Wanted 2)
Your tour guide did you so dirty😭 most of these are not Icelandic candy
Ah, yes, glorious salmiakk, the salt of salts. Good on ya, Mark, for surviving the gauntlet.
Uhmm very sad you don't like it from Iceland though... but to be honest i hate wild meat in general 😅
I've always found those licorise rolls Mark calls "salty hell" to be fairly mild. There are worse saltier things than that.
Scandinavian specialties is good
In case anyone is curious some of the reasons why Icelandic candy is so heavy on the licorice are that it is very hard to grow crops in Iceland (shocking, I know) so licorice was one of the few things the early Scandinavian settlers could grow, and at various times in history (mainly during times of economic hardship) the Icelandic government banned candy imports because they produced their own candy. So it's very much a cultural and agricultural product.
The last one made me think Markatouille.
I don't know why but Mark trying to pronounce Icelandic words is so funny to me.
Love his cat = not icelandic, when in actuality its cat = almost definitely icelandic
He should review Portuguese Candy
mark... you know we have food safety laws in europe right...... quite a few of them stricter than the ones in the us of a... loved the video though. great fun and yeah i dont know why so much of the northern candies are just.... salt and liquorice. it evades me.
Im 42 and from the UK, I used to have Melody Pops when I was a kid haha, also cola maoams are the best (we pronounce them m-ow-ams),  Also give Lixian a raise for his amazing editing
I live in iceland and theres a volcano going on an doing bad shit to a town😢
I've missed these so much! It's also quite funny how in this video about Icelandic candies, the conclusion we can draw is that Mark doesn't like Swedish or Danish candy :D
HELP WANTED 2?   (Cute emoji I can’t find it)
Markiplier struggles to open candy for 49 minutes
Mark struggling to say some of the names is hilarious and made my day
Where did the headband come from am I crazy
What are the best kind of canoes?     Volcanoes
Eat it and be happy
CAUTION: There was nothing else to the video besides Icelandic candy.
1 man, 100 accents
Does America not have maoams? They’re very common in the uk and Iceland too I’m guessing
I identify with Amy understanding "soccer" instead of the other word.
40:25 I love flying saucers (that what we call them here) the vimto ones are great
Americans when they learn that other countries don't put a ridiculous amount of sugar in everything: 👁️👄👁️
My Amma is from Iceland. And I have been there a couple of times. It is so cool to see other people experience it .
It's always funny watching americans try Tyrkisk Peber, which is delicious btw :P props to Mark though for not just spitting it out, like all the other people I've seen try it do. You need to try Norwegian candy some time, especially the chocolate, which is amazing and creamy and delicious
He’s having so much fun w that whistle pop 😂
What Lambs head
that intro sus
Intro prolly one of my favorites ngl
Why is his voice so satisfying
Mark reading Icelandic sounds like Simlish
By the way Mark, the whistle lollipop should have a little plastic note with (musical) notes to play
I love being in your mind Mark, it's so dark and sticky and so very echoey in here? I love the reaction you make as you try mysterious food?
46:48 Lakrids by Bülow is extremely expensive quality licorice and confectionery. It's by a danish company, because Denmark (among all the other nordic countries) somehow really love licorice (it's like a 50/50, either you love or hate it (with some exceptions)). I personally dislike licorice a bunch, but if its made by Bülow? You bet imma eat the crap out of it. Lots of the candy Mark tried in this video was not icelandic, some of it is from german, finnish, swedish, and other companies and so on. But definitely popular in Iceland, I'd think so anyway. As a danish person, who has never visited Iceland before, I recognized a bunch of these candies as they're a staple of my childhood foods. I still hate licorice, but I can't say I haven't eaten any of those terribly salty licorice candies before - still hate it.  Anyway, glad Mark survived with the few palette cleansers there were available! Good video, Mark!
The tyrkisk pepper is from finland and im interested how it did get there
iirc, the Nordic countries are well known for licorice candies
I had my mom tell me.. go to bed😂
27:30 window pupper!!!
Why are you dressed like a host for Survivor?
okay now you really have to try swedish candy! marabou, and swedish "pick it yourself" candy!
Im from Grindavík that is the town with the volcano rn
My favourite Mark content
try french candy/food
34:25 yep, not eating that is the way to go. It's supposed to be sealled at the top and shouldn't just pop open. My guess is some kid just got some gum and put the opened tube right back.  I don't remember if the flavor lasts so might have been something good, but not worth the food poisoning lmao
Nee man.. lick of protien..( no man, in Afrikaans)... i have no answers 😂
hi mark
You know its funny that i watch all of markiplier's review products that he made and then he comes up with another 1
MAOAM memtioned raaaaah
Love that you can hear the chewing, great for visualizing the experience 😂 I have only had a transfer flight on Iceland but they have great licorice 😊
43:44 i was thinking the exact same thing HAJAHAH
tooth paste
thats so portugese
Those intros are the ones I like the most :)
Finally good old markiplier video
That Tyrkisk Peber is a liquorice shell coated and filled with ammonium chloride powder. Thats so freaking nasty, I cant believe they get away with selling that. Eating that whole bag at once could land you in the emergency room
Ive been missing these review videos 😂
hahahahahahHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I remember the Jerry can gum when I was a kid in Canada 🇨🇦
Did y’all see Spencer?? Is Mark watching him for Ethan for some reason? Or did Ethan gift Spencer to him?
There needed to be a disappointing fart noise when the drink appeared - as anticlimactic as possible.
what's funny is that it sounds like he is trying to cast spells every time he tries to pronounce the words.
I think you can eat some European food  Ukraine ❤
Please don't give your dogs any human candy. Some of the Sweetening ingredients we use are toxic to dogs and their kidneys.
10:30 mark looks traumatized
The Icelandic Candy are: Jólaköttur - Lakkrís Rúlla - Tríttlar - Eitt Sett - Opal - Djöflar - Þristur - Lakkrís Rör - ( And the Lakkrís Rör was obviously an old one, it was way too hard to be new!)
The "nipples" are actually mushrooms, chanterelle to be exact. And they are Swedish. The hockey pulver is also Swedish. The skole kridt is most likely Danish, judging by the spelling. To tell if something is Icelandic, look at the letters. If there's a lot of ´ ` things on the letters it's probably Icelandic.
She's right what if something happens my brother died Monday night
5:52 it is actually the swedish flag! I saw it too before you pointed it out🇸🇪
oh no...not the volcanoes
I work in Gränna and its located Sweden...i love liquorice and Raspberry candy 😄
31:42 this has to be one of the funniest moments that I’ve ever seen from mark😂
Food theoryyyyyy
chocolate covered gummy bears?? what? also i saw something similar at shop - straws for milkshake but there are plastic straws with sugary smth inside. so was worried at 44:46
Who is actually going to get candy from Iceland unless you live in Iceland? Like why is that even a thing? :/ Mark has made no sense recently.
I've never watched a Ryan's Toy Reviews video but this video reminded me of one when Mark opened a candy bag too early around the 31 minute mark and Amy asked him to show the package.
I did not realize that Jack Sparrow was part Asian.
Bro was about to ignite a red lightsaber with that fit.
We have those dust gums here too in the states Marky boo
40 mins of mark doing mark stuff i like it
Their food safety standards are probably better then America have you ever look up what the American fda allows in our food from chemicals to rat poop go ahead take the dark dive lol😂
YES! YES! YES! Reviews are back chat!
I'd happily watch him try some Danish treats/candy :D
The gas can gum and the whistle sucker were both things I've had as a child didn't know they weren't known
I hope he misread Ammonium Chloride cause that IS NOT FOOD! It is not safe to ingest and can cause serious damage to the gastrointestinal and pulmonary systems in even relatively small amounts.
The amount of laughter that propelled from my body when the tune continued for intermissions.
I am becoming convinced that "lixian" is starting to become an actual hallucination mark is having and talking to and they have to edit in the cartoon lixian whenever it happens in videos.
Hmm where on earth do you see a cat Mark 😅
Thats my country baby
18:09 this was literally my childhood, how did you never have any?
ive missed marks food reviews
It hurts me so much to know that Mark was here (in Iceland) and I didn't get a chance to meet him. Been a fan for so many years and I would have LOVED to invite him and Amy (if she was with him) to dinner. Mostly to show them the Icelandic version of a "ghetto". I live there. Aside from that HOW DARE YOU MARK!!!. HOW DARE YOU not know our candies. You got so much wrong and your flavour receptors need checking because you disliked the best stuff!!!
I only have 2 nipples but I also have 2 belly buttons
I wanna order some chocolate covered liquorice right now!
The look of pure terror right after he takes his first bite of each different candy… I don’t think I want to try Icelandic candy.
Noice
« But hey, it’s just a theory, a food theory »-Markiplier 2024
I don't even live near Iceland but this video is still so entertaining!!!
Some of the candies are same we have here in Finland :) Finland LOVES salmiak and licorice ! We have that company Fazer :) I don't like the basic Tyrkis Pepper ( we call it just Turkin pippuri ) , but I love those same but fruit flavored :) that first choc bar looked like choc bar we have here called ''Tupla'' :) Also the one Mark said is saltiest one, we have those too but it''s called ''Noidan piippu'' lol, theres thicker and thinner ones :D great reactions! that tubble gum, i used to have it as kid but i always swalloed it cos it was so sweet like candy :D
Why has Mark got Spencer? What did I miss? Xx
18:30 the sound of eternal doom and dying childeren in distance sounds like
My finnish candy tasting dreams are slightly fulfilled with you trying the Tyrkisk pepper candies 😂 amazing video
Chica, Henry, and Spencer!!!
Candy!!!
maoam is btw from haribo which is german
50 shades of licorice
26:57 the look on his face got me rolling 😂😂😂
*mark naming nordic countries and saying dutch instead of danish* i cried
I just got an ad to start reviewing icelandic candy and you post this.
Mark looking like a pirate.
Powdered gum is the most texturally disgusting thing I've ever heard of.  You are braver than me and if we were to 1v1 I would get stomped.  Good day to you, sir.
Hey mark love the video but the only reality I'm in is in your mind and in your YouTube channel so can you help me
A lot of Nordic candy is quite intermingled, and even the stuff from Maoam is actually German.
You need to play the new horror game rotten flesh
41:10 they are so fucking cute omg
hey markiplier😁
Heres a chalang try Lithuania candy🇱🇹
4:47 i thought he was gonna say his grandma was dead 😭
Hahahaha, I love nordic countries, and I saw maybe 70~80% of these candies. I tasted peppermint chocolate in Netherland (there is a candy shop in Amsterdam, with an incredible amount of flavors... There is even chili, that taste chocolate and chili hot sauce at the same time!), the first one in Sweden (but named "kannonball"), and the Opal one in Iceland. And the big chocolate bar with gum in Norway.  A thing I remember also from Norway that was amazing is a bag of salty potato chips... chocolate covered. I eat the bag, was a perfect sweet-salty combination... with potato chips...
Just the video i needed to see today🧡
Mark could you play "In Sound Mind"? It's a really good horror game that I feel like you would enjoy play and figuring out the story.
love the extreme zoom ins, really made my skin crawl :D
I love Mark's reaction to eating Djöflar and just swears - as that is literally the word for "devils", as well as a kind of swearword in Swedish 😂
Ok I can’t be the only one that simultaneously said “that’s just a theory” God the timing was perfect lmao
it seems that Mark is not really a big fan of salty liquorice
Liquorice or however you spell it, is gross 🤢
Villikötur, Stjörnurúlla, Trílatlar, Eitt sett/Súper sett, Opal, Þristur og lakrísrör   are Icelandic the rest was not, the Peppermint chocolate and peppermin thing one might have been didn't see the packaging well enough. well loved this video man :3
the comedic timing of those whistle tunes is absolute GOLD
Oh.. no rice crispy my ass.. it very thick and tastes like caramel if that's the case..😂
Let's fucking go, classic markiplier content
Has anyone noticed that Mark is slowly becoming a Pirate of the Caribbean?
43:31 I would love and pay to see mark and matpat doing an special called “food theory” 😂
omg my fav youtuber trying candy from my country, awesome
what if lixian just didn’t edit himself in so mark looked like he was just going insane 😭
I love Mark
So many "Icelandic" candies that are actually from the UK, or at the very least super common over here XD
The headband gives Mark +10 Main Character Energy
i love markipliers review videos
Its "school chock". Which is mint coated liquorice (Or can be, depending on which once they are)
huh didn't expect iceland
He's gonna have a jar of dirt.
I have a feeling Darkiplier has a hankering not only for possessing Mark, but also for Icelandic candy
“Oh look! It has bulbous nodules!” Got me. 😂😂😂😂
It’s licorice.
Don't think too hard which is which mark just go with the flow.. that work out last time.. Mark big brain: ERROR
Jólaköttur - Icelandic, from Góa Gränna - Swedish candy Trítlar - Icelandic, from Nói Bubbledust - Never seen it in my life. Definitely NOT Icelandic. Stjörnurúlla - Icelandic, from Appolló Chocolate - peppermint thing - Not Icelandic, probably Danish or something Tyrkisk Peber - Fazer is a finnish company, but the language on the packaging is Danish Melody lollipop - Chupa Chups is Spanish Hallonsalta - Swedish, from the same company that made the second one Hockey pulver - Swedish candy Maoam - German candy Súpersett - Icelandic candy from Nói Opal - Icelandic, again from Nói Bismarks whatever - Again, probably Danish Djöflar - Icelandic from Freyja Tubble Gum - From the UK Þristur - Icelandic, from Sambó (The Þ is a TH btw) Skole Kridt - again Fazer, again Danish on the packaging Tyrkisk Peber Hot and Sour - Fazer once again. I.e. not Icelandic. Frisia - Apparently these are Belgian Lakkrísrör - From Apolló, typical Icelandic Lakrids by Bülow - Danish company  15/22 final score
We are back with the food reviews I see.
Why is Solid Snake eating so much candy, he can't infiltrate Shadow Moses with a tummy ache
❤😂
Five night at Freddy come on pro😊
37:10 we have those in the Netherlands too, we call them “schoolboard chalk” they’re alright if you’re craving that specific taste.  And everything from Maoam (Haribo) is German Frisia is from Belgium
THE SECOND CANDY HAS THE SWEDISH FLAG ON IT. My swedish friend confirmed that is in fact swedish candy not icelandic
Aww cmon i wouldve wanted to meet you
That jumpscared me at 7:07 it was quiet then 😱
I have never been so excited for a Markiplier video
Hockey pulver is sugar, ammonium chloride and licorice powder. You are supposed to dip your tongue in it.
Only Mark and lixian can make a 3 minute intro actually Interesting.
Those chupachup melody pops were my childhood. So fun!
YIPPEE
So how many did you guess right?
watching this as a nordic person is so funny because we're used to and love candy that's just a LOT less sickly sweet than american candy lol 😭  (also anything from the brand fazer is going to be finnish. the unidentifiable powder is salmiak/salty liquorice powder)
43:40 "but hey, that's just a theory: A food theory!!" we all love a theorist reference from mark   lmao man I've missed these review videos i just love the chaos of everything and the silly angles
So apparently ammonium chloride is actually dangerous if takin in large doses or takin for a long period of time. So maybe don’t eat the candy with that in it😅
the tubble gum being open is so funny, it's meant to have a little foil wrapper over the top but that looked tampered with for sure, who let their child consume that secretly .
4:36 Actually, the text on the candy is written in Swedish. So some of these candies are not actually from Iceland 😅. Also 5:36 "Sounds icelandic", Franssons is from Sweden but still he's close
Licorice is gonna be in Mark's nightmares for a very long time
Ammonium Chloride is used to make Batteries. Can confirm it is NOT good for you, it messes up your gut so bad-
Great review, Love ur content!
LETS GOOOOO I WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS VIDEO 🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸
How many different lenses did Mark use in this video?
Claim your I am from Iceland ticket here
Day 3 (complete forgot to do this the past few videos)  of saying you should cosplay Johnny silver-hand
Love to see Amy interacting in the video! As well as the pups! Really fun video :3  Also ooh I like candy-coated licorice; basically good n plentys
"Some say ammonium chloride has a strong, unique taste that's a combination of bitter, salty, and a little sour. Others say it's pungent, with a sharp, fish-like odor. Some say it tastes like window cleaner."
Cool video
aw thank you for trying this, im from Iceland myself!
Pirateplier realised
2:26  Amy: I don't know what's going on  Then a few seconds later  Amy: I think we're just out of practice  My brain: NOPE! This is EXACTLY what I expect, it amuses me, and I agree with Mark 100%. You're doing great.🤣💛👏  Also, Mark, did you spit that gum powder out off-camera, or did you swallow that?!?
Markil pier
So much of that is UK candy lmfao
I JUST got back from Iceland and the entire time I was like what if mark is here rn
The SECOND he said "Salmiak?" I went "OH NOOOOOOOOOOO." If you've ever had salmiakki you know exactly what that's gonna taste like.
As an Icelandic person I am beyond happy that you visited us on the island nation! And no... Jólaköttur is Icelandic lol.
15:11 Turkisk peber is actually a Finnish candy made by Fazer, which is a Finnish brand👀
I love licorice - as a result I’m super picky about licorice. I eat tons of salt and love salt (I have dysautonomia).   I once had salted licorice from Denmark. I very much did nit like. Big regret.
do swedish candy if you havent tried already
Ok we're three layers deep into Mark's mind and we're finally talkin about candy. Hope we don't fall deeper into Marks mind throughout this video.
Ammonium Chloride is normally used as a flux in the metal-working industry, so that salt is not edible. I think Icelandic people would know that from the beginning.
31:36 "salmiakku" mt brain immediately went "oh salmiak this is going to be fun" I was not disappointed
I thought Spencer was Ethan's dog
Mark...thos scandanavian nations Love their licorice like....LOVE that shit
For those that don’t know, when the Turkish Licorice (from Finland) claims to be “hot” they mean it like “chemical burn from the ammonium chloride”
4:35 Well that's just straight-up Swedish. Gränna is a little town on the road between Stockholm and Malmö. Definitely not Icelandic xP That raspberry-liquorice combo is quite common here actually. It says "Heartily delicious from Gränna"
Ive noticed that in all of Markiplier's recent videos he is wearing a headband. He seems to have adopted a new style and i am here for it.
As a man from Sweden and a candy aficionado I can tell you that the hockey puck named "supersalt hockey pulver" is swedish and pretty much sums up half of the candy experience in Sweden. It's licorice/salted licorice and the other half is an excessively broad collection of outrageously sweet candy that takes many shapes and forms. A big portion of it is chocolate and different types of jelly candy.
i was just watching his old vids like this and miss them so much im so happy he made another one
E
Markplier is the number 1 sweets channel review 😂🇬🇧🇺🇸
The slide whistle song they used between each candy was wonderful idk why I love it so much
Mark's whole outfit right now looks really good, and good on him. Ayyyy.
When he made the food theory reference I almost cried, we'll miss you Matpat😔
The fact that only distractible listeners knows the actual volcanoes story is hilarious
Mark: *You will be trapped in my mind for all eternity*  Also Mark two seconds later: I bought candy
Turkish peppers! Finland woop woop.
Slide whistle candy had my sister's cat looking around like "dafuq is that?" Then I see Chica in the background of the video with pretty much the same look 😂😂
god i missed the reviews so much
YES! Mark reviewing stuff and "X is DEAD to me" is one of my favorite series on here! Thanks for reviving it!
i feel like I just watched Mark eat licorice for 50 minutes.
Unlocked a memory from my childhood with that Melody Pop. We had those in the USA too.
Mark should try Swedish candies next
I keep tryong but theres always something about the candy reviews that doesnt click for me
those melody pops are actually ukrainian
I always knew that we were all just inside Mark's head.
love ur vids
I feel like Lixian needs a raise.... editing is always on point
*MARKIPLIER!!!*
I’m loving Mark’s slow descent into madness while talking to cartoon characters and general ramblings
It’s weird to me how many of these he’s never seen
I am so glad he turned back doing this series again 🔥
41:20 Spencer? ETHAN ETHAN ETHAN
Plane, sky ✈️🏢🏢  👀
I need a video of Mark struggling to open a variety of packages ASAP lol
Marks face after every candy taste: 🧐🤨
South Africa does wonders 😅
u were in my country and i didnt meet you!! so disappointed
41:19 SPENCER SPOTTED
Turkish pepper is Finnish omgg
0:01 Be careful with the bee, the bees are coming (Lethal Company)
The fucking whistling before each candy
Red gummy creep is lingonberry maybe?
i am from iceland! (give me clout)
i just looked up ammonium chloride, its not meant for candy, like the sugar free gummy bears of old. it is used in batteries, soldering flux, pickling agent, fertilizer, zinc coating, medicine, glue.   It can cause gastrointestinal and pulmonary injury leading to hospitalization from dilute sources, also skin irritation. the very trace amounts are why medicine taste so horrible.  It is banned in many places because of the asthma-like reactions to it and harm to kidneys.
Just Markiplier having the time of his life on those melody pops for almost a minute is hilarious. Beautiful
Diese Kommentarspalte ist nun Eigentum der Bunderrepublik Deutschland! Freut uns, dass dir deutsche Lakritze geschmeckt hat.
I hope Mark is wrong about the powder candy, cause if so he might retire.
Markiplier reviews is BACK, BABY!!!
Nothing beats mark going through the 5 stages of grief while eating candy for 50 minutes.
There are at least two cats in Iceland 🤔 and they are both in my house, just stop by on your next visit ! And thank you for teaching me that if there is a swedish flag on the candy it is definitely icelandic 😆.
too bad mark cant drink alcohol because of the heart attack thing.
Seeing Mark trying to handle and understand ammonium chloride aka main incredient to make salmiakki as a Finnish person, makes me so happy and full of laughter. And yeah, all the Fazer candy, is Finnish. Happy to know Iceland has some too to enjoy. >w<
Honestly. You should just rename the video to "i try swedish candy i bought on Iceland" xD
This is the perfect video to come home to ( : Thank you Mark for all that you do!
YES MORE IRL MARK
Is it me or does he look like jack sparrow l
Púkar means demons or devils or imps  They be very salty
i loved the video also mark that tubble gum normally has a plastic lid on the inside so you may have bought something that someone opened and already had a taste from
I CANT BELIEVE I DIDN'T SEE YOU IM SOOOOO MAD
for anyone curious, djöflar in specific translates to devils. just in case you might find that interesting
I'm so glad YouTube's number 1 food review channel is back
Can Amy also see Lixian or does she just humor Mark as he dives further into insanity?
I missed these Markiplier IRL silling videos yesterday❤ like this is perfect timing 😅
Mark mastered the musical candy very fast
Your grandmother may be Korean, but my grandfather is Russian.
Why does he sound like a jojo character 💀 35:28
ok
Hello Markiplier!!! I love your videos and keep up the amazing content!!!❤❤❤ You are my childhood
yea the raspberry licorice candy is swedish.... the text reads hearty goodness from gränna (gränna is a place is sweden) ....sorry mark...
spencer cameo!!
My danish ass got so excited when he pulled out the Bülow lakrids, they're so good i got so happy when he liked them.  Also watching mark slowly decend into madness over all the licorice was so funny because its the true nordic experience
Markiplier you should play zoochosis when it comes out
I love when mark and Amy do videos it’s always entertaining
With your lucky band around you fore head... lexin keep up the awesome effects
When you order Jack Sparrow from temu
It's said hearty goodness from Gränna, that's swedish candy 😂
36:37 that means "school crayons" i like m as a dutchie
Jerry Can bubblegum is awesome, also interesting video to watch with misphonia
Is that Spencer? New pup?
Wait till he gets into Brasilian candy 😂 Gonna need to get his sugar levels checked.
He looks a tiny bit like jack sparrow in this video
“I’m here with CTV news as this seemingly inactive volcano is starting to smoke! Eye witnesses claim it started about an hour ago!” 😂
mark has posted again
I love the ooos and ohs everytime he gets slid a new thing of candy, makes me giggle.
As a Swede, watching mark eat hockey pulver was the funniest shit in the whole video
i love the people already trying REALLY hard to get likes in the comments lol
BABE WAKE UP NEW MARKIPLIER REVIEW JUST DROPPED
the fact that he put the majority of the actually icelandic candy in the “not icelandic” pile is sending me 😭 fun that he posted it on a saturday (candy day in iceland)
took bro 3 minutes to decide an intro
i think that kockey pulver and that salty liqorice candy is a joke thing where they eat it in front of tourists and then they go home and enjoy some chocolate
This is really ironic cuz I’m going to Iceland for a class trip in October this year!
I'm icelandic and I haven't seen that toothpaste thing in a decade. 👀
Why is Spencer there???
I was here. Mark says volcanoes aren't real. I shall place my comment now before a volcano wipes out a small country and mark redacts his statement.
Mark needs to try quiklunch from norway
i couldve met him??!!—  im extremely depressed rn..
Just wait till mark hears about blue ópal, that was discontinued because it had chloroform in it
mark please give us a megacompilation of every face filter edit from every video
bro is this my luckiest day or what. mark posted a food review
Please try Portuguese candies or German candies 🙏 Love your review videos
Omg thank you so much for reviewing our beautiful countries candy
I missed Marks Reviews
every time he said “but hey” i was waiting for “ITS JSUT A THEORY” AND THEN HE ACTUALLY DID IT 😭😭
15:41 they came from my country: denmark
Game Grumps and Markiplier, only people I would watch a mukbang from
erm what the flip very good vid
The melody pop is British I think. In the same wrappers ours come in. And we have moaom pinballs too. The green are my favourite
“I don’t want that in me anymore.”
A lot of licorice today
I’ve missed Mark’s reviews!
24:17 So you love German candy 👀
ok
First second in and I already thought: “wow, what a lense”
The little flute riff he did sounds so goofy but good at the same time, it has a little touch of Mark in it
What Chica has new legs??
Marks mind is too deep and dark for me to enter
Tbf I was sure most of this was Norwegian, as I grew up on this as a Norwegian
I rejoice at the return of the sampler review videos!!! I love these so much because of the theories, facial expressions, and perfect editing! Work of art. Thank you all who worked on the video.
I’m I’m finally apart of something historic 🥳🥳⁉️⁉️
Mark should take over food theory 😅
I heard Mark read out the “salmiak” thing, said out loud “OH! I hope you’re prepared for that.” And then I got to laugh my ass of!
Björk gonna explode ur tv now
Putting this at 2x speed and hearing him try to pronounce these words makes him sound like a sim 😭😭
welcome to northern europe we have liqurish thats it nothing else
Mark looks like a biker gang member in 2008
Omg I had those whistle candies as a kid in Indiana!  They drove our parents crazy, lol.
God I wish Mark did a video that is just an intro to a video for a whole hour and that's it.
I can’t focus on anything but his nails 😭😭
All these muscles and YOU CAN'T EVEN OPEN A SMALL BAG OF CANDY!!!
i find it funny mark said maoam like he did btw its said like "m ow am"
Mark's melodies in between are killing me thank you Amy 😂
Was that SPENCER?!?
41:19 it that Spencer? It looks like Spencer xD
18:52 am I missing something here or does Mark just look like he reached enlightenment?
Here is a list of every candy he ate and if they are Icelandic or not coming from an Icelander: Jólaköttur-Icelandic Gränna-not Icelandic Trítlar-Icelandic Bubbledust-not Icelandic Stjörnu rúlla-Icelandic Chocholade peppermint-not Icelandic Tyrgisk peber-not Icelandic Melody pops-not Icelandic The nipple one-not Icelandic Hockey pulver-not Icelandic Maoam pinballs-not Icelandic Súper sett-Icelandic Opal-Icelandic The mints-not Icelandic Djöflar-Icelandic Tubble gum-not Icelandic Þristur-Icelandic Skole krid-not Icelandic The other tyrgisk peber-not Icelandic Frisia sour ufo tounge painters-not Icelandic Lakkrísrör-Icelandic Lakrids bülow-not Icelandic
As a Dane, it was so fun seeing Mark eat some danish candy that I see on the shelves of my supermarket, very enjoyable!
hmm
Soo we all know mark has eaten a package peanut, since he knows what it tast like lmao
Mark I caught ligma
Hän syö Fazerin Turkinpippuria. Suomi mainittu. Suomi perkelee🇫🇮🇫🇮🇫🇮
People who are here before 100k views👇👇
When Amy was choking on the super salty snack at 33:13 LOL. Always love when the pups make an appearance. If Spencer is there, where's Ethan?
Wait... the bubbledust one is from uk? I've never seen it before in my life 😅
Even though Mark doesn't do food reviews a lot i always look forward to seeing his food videos
with how much he hated salmiakki i need him to try more of Finnish candy,. It would truly be an honour for us😍
salmiakki is literally salty liquorice XD
Well you and my mom will get along 😂
For anyone who might be interested, Mark's favorite was "Lakrids by Bülow," which is actually from Denmark, and is a high-quality chocolate-covered licorice. I highly recommend it, even if you don't like licorice (like me).
Mark is very smart... most of the time. "There's no such thing as volcanoes" -_-
I do NOT want to see whats in Mark's mind.
maybe instead of paper straws we should start having liquorice straws
Love this ASMR videos
I'm always so happy when someone mentions my home country ❤
Marks face up in the dog cam like hi there I'm a dog😂.
every swed watching him eat the hockey puck
COME TO BRAZIL!
Amy: *visibly hates the salt candy*   Also Amy: *eats more of it*
I think I had an aneurism while in Mark's 3rd level mind.
does that tyrkisk peber cost 595 kr!!!??
As an Alpine glacier, I am very disappointed.
bro just called the swedish mushroom nipples :c
"But hey, it's just a theory, A FOOD THEORY!!" I love that especially since MatPat is retiring😭💕
I love Hockey pulver to the point of arrythmia sometimes (also I'm finnish, surprise!) The taste Mark can't describe is literally the ammonium chloride, what we call salmiakki. We made it ourselves in chemistry class.   What I always learn from these videos is that all nordic candy is basically very similar.. But Fazer is finnish even if it always hovers in every other nordic candy video..
Why Mark looks like John Wick and Captain Jack Sparrow's baby?
MAKE TURKEY NEXT!!!
markiplier discovers salmiak lmao
I love watching the views go up
The SCP containment breach horror sting for the Trítlar face… is surprisingly spot on
I love when Mark tries to react to things like a normal human and fails😂 Very "hello fellow kids" 10/10, would watch again
Do Brazilian snacks
Bro you need a hair cut
wow
"there is such thing as volcanoes" just ask all the Icelanders from grindavík that had to evacuate their homes in November 2023
When Mark was first testing out the whistle candy I thought it sounded like the noises from the Star Trek Enterprise lol
For all those who don't know, the licorice straw traditionally goes with coca cola, usually in glass bottles. It will make the foam go everywhere though because of the salt, so start drinking immediately.
I full on thought he was going to say "My grandma.... IS DEAD" 😭😭
Man i just watched the Del Monte corn video and was missing his videos like this
28:33 OMG no way! I got those exact same candies as a present last Christmas, it was my first time trying them too 😯😃 Good stuff
I love Salmiakki the "saltier" the better
Lixian getting real tired of Mark's sh*t😂😂
Ammonium chloride is used in cough medicine and plywood glue 👍
Lixian getting real tired of Mark's sh*t😂😂
I just felt the need to clarify that ammonium chloride is a very common candy that I quite enjoy known as salmiak (if I recall correctly)
31:47 Very cat like reaction
I'm curious is Liquorice just HUGE in Iceland or did they just manage to pick up a lot of liqourice sweets?
İ LOVE YOUR İRL VİDEOSSSSSSSSSSSSS  MAKE MORE AND FİNİSH HELP WANTED AND THEN MOREEEE
Oh my god the little jerrycan of gum we had in the states too! I remember having it as a kid but it was discontuned. The memories that broyght back.
I know I've tried that kind of licorice before. It had a very "medicinal" taste. If what I read was true Salmiakki has ammonium chloride added (I've read it can be a type of soft licorice) ... and  Ammonium chloride (salty as it can be)  has been said to help break down mucus, my tastebuds were probably right.
"Tyrkisk peper" is Danish, well the text is Danish, not sure if the candy is Danish. Iceland used to be part of Denmark's monarchy, but they asked to leave. So I assume a lot of Danish candy is still part of their daily lives.
Ice breaker candy
i actually almost cried when i saw the notification that mark made a real life video again what a moment in history
18:46 The way Mark went from disappointment to childish glee when he got the whistle to work was so cute
This is what the people in LazyTown eat every day! What a privilege!
So much lacriss
I know where the candy flute is from, it's from Spain :D
Lakrids by Bülow is actually a Danish brand. It is generally quite expensive, though I'm guessing the extremely high price Mark paid was due to it being imported.
When is coming next Fnaf Help Wanted 2 episode?
Mark during Turkinpippuri: "There is no such flavor to describe it!" Me as a Finn: "It's Salmiakki and most of us Finns adore it." e-e Also the n*pples were MUSHROOMS. XD
omg ive had the melody pops as a kid, they was one of my fav
this is so funny to watch as a dane
Ah yes, those nordic Dutch I’ve heard so much about 😂
this is giving me jack sparrow vibes
We haven't had one of these in so long 🥲. I'm so happy
Btw rdr2 has an epilogue the story doesn’t end when Arthur💀 you can kill micah
Yes! Mark snack reviews are back! 🍿
It is the Swedish flag, and it's probably on the Icelandic market. Can confirm that Licorice/Raspberry is a hit flavor combination that's over here in Scandinavia in everything from hard candy to gummies.
Ohhh next Finland! 🇫🇮🇫🇮 I really bet you cannot handle salty liquorice :)
I swear to god, not everything we eat is salty licorice
WE MISSED U, AMYYY
I really thought he was gonna say,"not my grandma cause my grandma is dead".
I love how half of these candy’s aren’t Icelandic😂
I love how he try to pronounce these so confidently lmao, some of this candies makes me miss home
L
Mark! Mark! Where'a Fnaf Mark? Don't make me start typing
YOU SHOULD TOTES DO DANISH CANDY NEXT IF YOU'RE DOING MORE !!! (ITS A MESS REALLY)
Anyone else now craving candy because of this
The whistle is like an anime intermission 😂
Mark goated with the G-Star raw jacket
I think Mark would’ve given that salty black licorice one from Dioflar a 10/10
As an Icelandic person I can confirm there are no volcanos
We looooooove salty liquorice and liquorice here in finland 😂😋
tyrkis peber is finnish!! and it actually has a salty licorice powder inside of it!! (salty licorice is super popular in all the nordic countries)
I usually don’t care about candy or food reviews but Mark is just so entertaining to watch
Man I miss these
Coming home from work in 2024 with markiplier reviews is like coming home in 2016 as a kid to play Minecraft
I love these type of videos
WAIT AMERICA DOESN’T HAVE PINBALLS ??????
we even got another review before gta vi
just came out an hour ago
Balz
0:27 I guess Grindavík is fine then
spencer!!!
The last candy he eat the chocolate covered licorice it's from Denmark from an little island called Bornholm who is really known for making those and candy
The Moon!! 🌕
omg spencer?? why is spence with mark 😭 im sure hes having fun tho
was that 3 dogs I saw Henry, Chica and what looked like a solid black dog but it could just be a reflection but on the dog exit shot I saw black between them was it Spencer maybe but why is Spencer with Mark and Amy not Ethan that's his dog
YOOO, Bubble Jug????? I didn't know they still make it/started up again!! I'mma have to look into getting some :000
Noooo I’m still catching up on the FNAF Help Wanted 2 vids😭😭😭
Its pretty funny that he just stopped rating the candies😂😂😂
Experiencing Mark discovering the wonderful world of salmiak is truly magnificent
lol
I've had this specific brand of tubble gum before and I can confirm they neither twist off, nor come sealed. The one mark had was probably fine, but I understand the apprehension
Yes Mark, that was the Swedish 🇸🇪 flag. This 🇮🇸 is the Icelandic flag.
Is it all melted?
The second on3 is SWEDISH😭 it literally has swedens flag
Sometimes I think Mark would make a great Jack Sparrow
Market pliers
He bought all the salt licorice 🤣
Should have been named "the gauntlet of licorice" 😂
ASMR with Markiplier
THE JINGLE HELL YEAH
I didn't expect there to be so many salty candies
Mark: Enter my mind Me: there's nothing in here
pp
The candle whistle really adds to the amazing news of this video! Also love hearing Amy in the background, i feel like it’s been a while!
Someone needs to take Mark's VHS copy of Pirates Of The Caribbean, awake from him.
18:52 just Mark’s facial expression when he finally got the whistle candy to work 😭😭
15:05 is tyrkisk peber(turkin pippuri) and it is from Finland 😁
Lixian I appreciate your Zoom powers! THE POWER OF ZOOM!
I wish I could've seen you here
can we collectively send mark back to geography class
Nice, content like this has always been fun and chill, along with marks humor making it just a nice watch
it's at 18:50 that the whistle pop binds with its host, and Mark realizes in a matter of seconds that he is lost
Liquorice.
Hey mark! That lowercase p lookin character is known as "thorn" and it actually makes a sound like the th in the word "thick"
We have a few of these in the UK. My dad loves pinballs
"I don't want that in me anymore"💀💀   Also, there are cats in iceland.
You're not selling Iceland, dude. It sounds like childhood would be a liquorice flavored trauma inside a museum of "packaging".
i haven't even watched it but the thumbnail is so me when i tried lakris
Normal review videos: They test out the food Mark review videos: Lots of ASMR goin on
Oh this should be fun
We all love when he does this s
I love you
Been awhile since one of these came out
Little did he know. That the bubble dust, is sold in the british supermarket chain.... ICELAND!!!   (I'm just kidding. I have no idea).
Honored to be sub 900 comments
25:59 When you're unsure if you've just summoned some otherworldly entity
22:52 wait...I'm pretty sure ammoniumchloride is mustardgas?  44:46 Also licorice straws seems like it might be a good plastic straw alternative, if it's more affordable
Oh god the salt hockey puck is ACTUALLY sugar, licorice, and salt…
As someone from the Nordics, I'm glad others are finally experiencing the pain as a person who dislikes liquorice here
Markiplier knowing theres a swedish flag on the candy: "This is from Iceland"
Can You do Finnish Candy Next?
43:40 he said the thing!
What we learned is money is the key to happy taste buds
Mark, arguably the king of milk, not choosing milk has left me devastated and sobbing
Don't tell me i missed seeing Mark 😭
Cool!
"Put up a picture" *Vietnam flash back*
I loved the "hey thats just a theory a food theory" part
I swear in the late 80s or early 90s you could get that jerry can of gum powder in the States. The brand may have been different, but I've had that product before, in my childhood.
Now i feel offended as a Finn, he didn't like the turkish peppers 😭 (try the megahot ones)
The Djoflat are salt licorice stuffed with pure salmiak.  the name means Devils. salmiak salt is what is added to make salt licorice salty.
Baby wake up, Mark posted ‼️💥
All I gotta say is the jingle has to stay for future candy reviews
Me and a few friends went to Iceland last summer and it was amazing, we all loved going there.
"doo wap bap boop bap"        - Marks Melody Pop
Craving sodium have milk mark
Mark’s food review videos are pure chaos and will always bring joy to my life
They're actually obsessed with licorice oh my god 😭
ولی اولی ایرانی بود 😂😂
amazing mark
Not the biggest fan of liquorice... I like it, i dont love it... I LIKE SAVING!
Wait, what other Nordic countries are there? I only know of Skyrim.
Loving this video so much! Didn't realise my life was missing a Markiplier Reviews video so much.  The melody lolly takes me back to my childhood (UK)
I loved his reaction to Djöflar, they start off REALLY powerful but get great after a bit (and addicting). Also highly recommend going to the Westfjords, best region of iceland (unbiased opinion) sadly our museum is closed at the moment due to winter
9:06 Mark gets one point for being old, but Wade is still in the lead
"I don't like that in me anymore" Mark2024 🤣🤣🤣
I love that almost half of the candy were swedish.
lol if you eat enough salted liquiorice you do end up liking it xD
Holy shit iceland mentioned  Edit: mark looks like solid snake in that headband
Alex Tima.... Please NEVER watch this vid.😅😅😅
i missed these types of videos
i just love at 5:00 you know exactly what hes thinking just from his face hahahahaha
Mark would be a perfect pirate. I don’t know why he just would. AT SEA WITH MARKIPLIER
Mark's Brittney Broski moment at 5:05 confirmed that he would be an incredible guest on her royal court!😍❤️‍🔥
we NEED more markiplier reviews
Okay. As a scandinavian, i will say that both all the 'Tyrkisk Peber' candy and the Lakrids by Bülow is Danish. and obviously there were some sweedish things in there as well. but nice video over all. very funny watching Mark trying to guess what flavour salmiaki (amoniumclorine) was.
please try yuppie psycho
EXCUSE ME MARK THERE IS .5% ALCOHOL IN THAT CAN OF NONALCOHOLIC BEER
Like a giant good and plenty
I feel like we haven’t had a video like this an ages ago
Skole Kridt is candy coated licorice... made for the Danish market... though i belive its made in Sweden or Finland
Let me take a wild guess it's more pure salt or salty licorice.
Mark needs to trim his nose hairs
i wonder if they realized Mark just made the Old Spice Jingle
wow,  " plane air sky souring through the heavens " hit hard idk why
4:35 "Gränna" is a swedish town that's famous for candy!
"Does Iceland have cats?"  Well... I did learn about something related to their christmas traditions and how one involves a cat that can eat people but I might have mixed that up with another country
mark should review SourBoys!!! It's such a great candy!
The whistle is killing me 😂  Also, I’m positive I’ve enjoyed an American version of both the whistle candy and the jug of bubblegum dust.
Mark looking like a rockstar from the 80's, and i f***ing dig it
Tyrkisk peber is from a finnish company, but was originally danish. it's name means "Turkish pepper" in danish. Skolekridt is also danish, and is supposed to look like the chalk you use on chalkboards in school. it's called "School chalk" Lakrids by Bülow is also danish, very expensive but very beloved, his sister(?) makes coated marshmellows that are pretty good!
"It could be another Nordic countries, It could be Swedish, Norwegian, Dutch?" Danish and Finnish people:
Wow, it seems Iceland really loves liquorice!
I love the facial contortion edits
it's cool to see that we have alot of the same candy in Norway ^_^  yeeey more review videos :3
I had a snack box subscription. I loved Finlands hands down. It was the most delicious ever, I have been a bitter and cold American since I h a d to end that box. I just want a box from Finland 🇫🇮
11:24 don’t say that
I FUCKING LOVE MARK REVIEWS RRRRAAAAAAAAAYHHHHHH🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Spencer!!!
‏‪15:52‬‏ 😂😂😂😂
31:42 is the absolute best reaction 😂
that was bomb
THE SERIES IS BACK!
i’ve never been shot into marks mind so hard at such a velocity unbeknownst to mankind before, i’m honored
Ive been to iceland twice now, and licorice is EVERYWHERE. also the pronunciation insanity was felt 😭😭
Wasted opportunity to quote Fry from Futurama
Iceland candy
How he speak the names is so funny. When I right remember that few candy’s from Germany 😂. There came many candy’s the i had in my childhood. I miss they they really. Why are few didn’t anymore in Germany? That’s not fair.
This man's facial expressions
As a Swede, seeing mark eat my favourite candy and cringe is beyond fun.
The Opal candy is more known as a mini cough drop, or something like that. Relieves your throat a bit after you keep it in your mouth.
As soon as I saw that licorice I knew it was going to be that weird hyper-salty stuff. I tried it (or something like it) in a sweet shop in Brighton and it was horrific. He told us he can't sell it because nobody wants it so he just lets people taste it.
I think Mark liked every single candy VERY much and he definitely rated them all a 10/10. Can’t prove me wrong.
Review lays chips.
Could you play the horror game called rotten flesh it looks spooky
Been waiting ofr this to come out, lets go
19:40 i think you can buy those in spain, i remember eating those as a kid
oh my god mark i NEEDED THIS today
We've all been waiting for the return of Markiplier Reviews.
Fun fact: Icelandic is the only modern language to still use the thorn (Þ, þ, pronounced as a hard "th" as in "thorn") and the eth (Ð, ð, pronounced as a soft "th" as in "this").
sorry markiplier, as an icelander i am severely dissappointed in this choice of candies. you clearly did not think twice before picking these, my heart hurts from your wrong doings, we are more than just spicy liquorice candy country
8:29 "Maybe it hated me" had no reason to be as funny as it was
16:20 my reaction as a kid eating tyrkisk pipar for the first time
I've waited for this day.... for another review video, for what seems like decades.... it finally happened 🤌🏼
Mark taking care of the 3rd camera lol
"Just like airheads, the kinda oversell the spice..."  Sounds like he has experience.
Not even 6 minutes in and he somehow offended the whole 6 people that live in Iceland.
The first two minutes is just Mark being a psychopath. And that’s completely normal for a Markiplier video.
Completely forgot about the iceland volcano thing. That was a LONG time ago they talked about that on distractible lol.
First "icelandic" candy he presents happens to be swedish XD
i love this review serie 🫶
I love Amy hahaha she’s literally me
Gränna is a swedish town
Mark literally picked up a trauma response by the end of this…I don’t know if he’ll ever trust normal looking candy again😂
ICELAND MENTIONED 🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸🦅🦅🔥🔥🗣️🗣️
i wonder what lens markiplier is using for this video
Love the SCP 173 candy.
The second candy is a really classic SWEDISH candy
Christmas cat from iceland? Not icelandic! Literally the swedish flag?! Iceland.
Cats have been around in Iceland for centuries, or since Iceland was settled in 870
Him tasting the Grandma candy reminds me of the Kombucha Girl
You should DEFINITELY try Finnish candies and chocolate.  Tyrkish Pebers are made in Finland (Fazer is a Finnish candy and chocolate producer) and the thing in the middle of those candies is salt liquorice powder.  The salt liquorice powder (the "hockey pock") is so goddamn good! I remember eating that when I was a kid and I liked it back then, too.
Damn its a shame none of the candy in this video coming from an icelandic person mexican American who has no ancestors in iceland nor has ever heard of the country before this video
As a Fin who loves Trurkin Pipuri I was laughing  so hard
🤣
Don't tell Mark that Ammonium Chloride is used in making batteries and other industry applications. Eating too much of it can cause nausea and/or induced vomiting.
This felt like it was 10 minuets when it was 40
Plane air sky…. Truly an amazing speech.
Wait...when did mark do review videos? Have I been living under a rock the last 5 years? 😱❤️
It’s gotta be licorice.
I love hearing people try to pronounce icelandic words
MAOAM MENTIONED
BUT WHAT LENS IS HE USING
Why do they have to put licorice and salt in everything? Like seriously a chocolate bar with LICORICE in it???
Am I the only one that thinks Mark looks like Captain Jack Sparrow?
37:47 YEAH FINLAND AGAIN
The way he talk remembers me Gus
It’s probably good they don’t have American food safety standards. That means it probably won’t kill you like American food will
Im rn eating ecactly the maoam kracher here in germany xD
Gasp it's not a fnaf or lc video. It's a miracle.
Ill be honest, you never really see how pretty Mark's eyes are until you're really up close and personal with the man.
In Norse mythology, Freya rides a sled pulled by two giant cats so…  I don’t think discounting all the candy with cats on the packaging was a wise move, lol
Markiplier gets tortured by licorice for 50 minutes
Why is licorice so common in so many candies
My guy made a little jingle with a candy🤣
So that first candy is just a starcrunch
i too am a volcano denier.
Genuinely thought this was a video from like 3 years ago that I just never watched cuz I thought he stopped doing this stuff awhile ago
very yum yum good yummy
CHICAAAAAA
3:44 that’s a hundred grand
BUT THATS JUST A THEORY
Alternative title: John wick taking a break from the killing.
People from Iceland are profusely sweating as Mark tries their candy. Everyone please pray to your gods. That this man doesn't end up in the hospital after eating your candy
mark needs a Himalayan salt lamp to just lick
Mark - the fire doesn’t stand for hot. It stand for flammable. You’re eating gasoline.
Thought I was watching pirates of the Caribbean for a minute
MARKIPLIER CANDY REVIEW??? WE ARE SO BACK
Im from Denmark and when I was a child I loved "Tyrkisk Peber" and "Skole Kridt" 🤣🤣
Alternative title, “Mark tries weird licorice for almost an hour.”
Captain jackiplier
"this is propably authentic" candy bag with a swedish flag
SO MARKIPLIER WAS IN MY COUNTRY AND NOBODY TOLD ME?
sometimes you're weird ass guy mark
18:27 Marks famous playing ❤️
Let warfstach do it
What the fuck?! I did NOT expect to see something from Gränna in this! My Swedish childhood memories! 😍 Also the liquorice that's incredibly salty: that's salmiak and it's so delicious! Too much of it will literally burn your tongue. My physics teacher used to have a bucket of it on his desk and we'd all get a punch of it every class 😂
was that Henry?!
mark putting the candy with the swedish flag on it in the icelandic pile made me genuinely upset
Hockey pulver. We used to snort it at my school. It hurt so bad! I tried it only once and I can still feel the pain just by thinking about it.
Mark has a candy center confirmed.
Mark at 18:52 My cat: 👁 👄 👁
I've had the whistle pop they used to be sold here back in the 90s
Mark, you need to review brazilian candies.  One of my favourites (as a brazilian) is Caribe, its a chocolate bar filled with mashed banana.
Me wondering why Markiplier has so many health problems. Then me listening to him talk about his salt intake and how he dips his movie popcorn into pure salt . . . Ahh I get it now
first
dude Mark has the best facial expressions 😂
I feel personally insulted anytime people react negatively to licorice or salted candy also "hjärtligt gott från gränna" is swedish, and there's a swedish flag, also I've eaten that candy before, so I think it's swedish.
I’m pretty sure that hockey Pulver was smelling salts?
41:20 SPENCER??
Icelandic viewer here, thanks for trying our candies
The suomi perkele moment of mark eating turkish pepper
Yeah I wouldn't trust that that's suspect af I'd throw that out immediately cause fuck that seriously! 34:25
I love Amy just having to watch Mark do all this shit for probably over an hour
as an icelandic person your mom
Me as a swedish person knows that the second food is from sweden but i havn't really tested that one yet. But it is pronounced "heartligt gott fron greana
A CANDY EATING VIDEO FROM MARK ??? its been soo loong😮
I see he has gotten sweets from the Land of Ice
i didnt know that the Netherlands was a part of the nordic countries
😃
YOOO NON GAMING VID LETS GOO
HI
The candy at 36:25 skole kridt it's really popular here in denmark and is made here as well. Is a kind of licorice
Everytime you try to pronounce what it is. It's like your casting a spell.
He recorded this video a long time ago I wonder why he waited so long to upload it
He is one of the best youtubers that won't quit until he is a billionaire
I just listened to the Distractible episode where Mark talks about Dextrose, and now he released this video. Interesting.
17:48 Mark looking at Amy like, “… Right…? Riiight…??”LMFAO
Sodium Nitrate on the salty candy?
I had those candy ufos they were good. It hits so much nostalgia
"Not my favorite gummy" 😅
Captain Markiplier Sparrow
ÍSLAND NÚMER EITT!!!!
TYRKISK PEBER OMG FINLANDD TORILLE🇫🇮🇫🇮🇫🇮🇫🇮‼️‼️
Tyrkisk peber is Finnish candy, love them 😅😂👍
Epic
Watching this made me want maoam pff
Sorry Mark. It's impossible to be intimidated when the close up focuses on the nose hairs becoming one with the mustache😂😂😂
I missed these sorts of videos.  (Also lowkey miss the 'Makes' series.)
I'm in love with Mark's Jack Sparrow phase
One thing you need to know about the Nordic countries is that we love our licorice and salty licorice LOL
I love this
Egg
Before the video: "Hello Icelandic candy my name is Markiplier"
Yes the second candy is Swedish
Was funny to watch Mark try out Tyrkisk Peber, and he's absolutely right that candy isn't Icelandic it's actually Finnish 😂
I just saw a video about a game called Zoochosis, and it's a horror/infection game where you play as a zookeeper, and I want to see you play through it if that's alright
Meanwhile cats are more popular in Iceland than dogs…
My initial thoughts when I saw the title was "I bet some of the candies are from the other Nordic countries" and I got it confirmed already on the second candy.
BRING BACK MARKIPLIER MAKES!!!!!!!!!!!!💜❤
Good video mark (havent watched it yet)
I love Markiplier outfits!!!!!!❤😭❤
first couple of seconds are funny!! I know this video was going to be good
As an Icelandic boy did I never In my 20 years of living think this would ever happen
INCEPTION TIMES ICELAND IS REALLY BLOWING MY MIND
Im so early pls pin me mark ive been watching for years but this is i think the first time im this early 😊❤
Mark should do Dutch candy it’s soooo goood
Mark has a very relatable habit of saying something confidently and then completely contradicting himself without ever breaking the flow of the conversation.
I'm literally so disappointed he was in Iceland and I couldn't see him 😿😿😿
Great now I want to eat candy and it's past closing hours already 😂😭
finally some more mark irl
So how many demons did Mark accidentally summon filming this? 🤣😂
Lesson of the day :  Icelandic people like liquorice and salt.   And obnoxiously salty liquorice.
😂  your reactions are priceless comedy gold hot damn 😂.
i live on that island
Woah no one finished this video yet
Kóngurinn
Ammonium Chloride is just liquorice-
i’m so early…
37 minutes ago, and theres already 1.6k comments
Oh boy, I sure hope there aren’t any untimely mentions of volcanoes in this video!
I can indeed tell you that the first thing was swedish as a very nordic sweden man
😂31:43 that candy woke something up in Mark.
did he just call the netherlands nordic
Did mark ever find his replacement for Takis? 🤔
At this point i'm certain Mark is convinced that Lixian is always just to the left or right of him. Hell, at this point i'm not sure if Lixian might not just actually be there every time.
Only Lixian would put a jump scare in a candy review video.
that one camera is so close the entire time and it throws me off every time it’s so funny
Tyrkisk peber tastes like jägermeister for those wondering. Terrible imo.
Fazer is a finnish brand and with the Turkisk peber welcome to the world of salty liquirice aka salmiakki😂.  BTW it is good and you cannot run from that or liquirice in a Nordic country. It’s unique. Those chupa chups used to have a different name and ate is as a child. Also we have very similar candies here that what is on this video.
MARK WENT TO ICELAND OMG bro I love Iceland sm it's one of my special interests AND IM SO JEALOUS RN AHHHH
When is next help wanted 2 video
Pirate Mark is my favorite era of Markiplier
"There is no such thing as volcanoes." -Mark Edward Fishbach, 2024
Can you review Mexican candy next ?
im willingto bet thi8s is authentic..... with the swedish flag on it.
my coworker went to Iceland and brought back those salty ass black licorice things, we all took one at the same time and none of us were able to keep it in our mouth for more than 20 seconds. crazy stuff
yes markiplier that is the swedish flagg and "hjärtligt gott från gränna" means "hearty goodness from gränna (Gränna is a city from sweden)
Let’s normalize not having the patience or self discipline to not bite into candy that you’re supposed to suck on
Words cannot express how much I love watching videos of Mark reviewing candies 😂
Pls someone tell me what’s with the head band it’s kind of driving me nuts lmao
Someone send him finnish candy 😂 he will not like ot
At the time I am writing this comment the views on this video are like 20% of Iceland's Population
Imagine if this was the FIRST, ONLY and INDEFINITE piece of Markiplier content you ever consumed.
Frackin NO, Never 😷
‏‪0:05‬‏ 😂😂😂😂
at 15.07 that's finnish candy!! torille!! it's also salty licorice specifically (or salmiakki as we call it) and! the stuff on the inside he was talking about is a fun powder :D i love his reaction to it too that's fantastic edit: also at 37.50! second torille moment :D but yeah fazer is a finnish company
I freaking love Markiplier.
M!
was in fact not Icelandic (number 2)
Oh fuck...  I don't wanna be in Mr Mark's brain anymore 😢 😂😂😂❤ love you mark.
Tyrkis pepper is finnish candy and it's salmiakki. It's saltier candy
the melody pop jingle makes me giggle every time lmao
being icelandic, it hurt watching this.
why do you look like jack sparrow
Yes more reviews please I've been waiting for them for so long MOOOOOORE
DO POLISH CANDY!! PTASIE MLECZKO ETC
a message from an icelander: what the fuck
Oh no Alex probably be fuming
60,936 views
I'm curious that ever different country have there own different snack and different flavors 🤔
Bro bought candy with the swedish flag on it and thought it was icelandic 😭
woah
Didn't know I needed 49 minutes of Mark struggling to open packeges with candy 😂
YESS MARK REVIEWS ARE BAACK
I've been waiting years for another food review video
dude, Im stuck in your mind, get me out of here
Þetta er svo æðislegt.
"not my grandma, my grandma, is... Korean" that is not what I thought he was going to say 💀
Brother where is the FNAF VIDEO😅
nice video
i missed reviews and irl vids 💖
9:10 Jerry Can comes from the second world war, and Jerry meant The Germans, because they invented it. The more you know.
Love the trio of Mark, Amy, and Lixian. Amazing energy
THATS SO FUNNY I JUST WENT TO ICELAND HAHAHAH
Commenting so someone shows me the haunted mask Mark was talking about.
I have ptsd being in Mark's mind
😂😅😂😅
I thought it will never happen again A Mark review  Perfection
Omg it’s been so long since a video like this has come out!!!
Was it Tyler who got Danish and Dutch mixed up at your Danish show? :P Well, you'd think that you'd learn from his mistake, but it would seem not, Denmark and the Netherlands are still not the same country, and as a Dane, I am once again deeply offended! XD  And ammonium chloride (more commonly known as salmiac) is actually a really common ingredient in stronger licorice products here in Scandinavia, especially in Finland.. :P That is also what you tasted in the Tyrkisk Peber candies.. ^^ And yes, it is absolutely saltier than salt, and no, it is not good for you, it can make your heart pound like crazy! XD
Markidaddy rn🗿🗿🗿
Every time Mark tries and reviews (and insults) a bunch food on camera, it's like Christmas for us all over again 😂 Truly a treat for the soul
The scream of the falling ball made me giggle so much
Mark's "it's not spicy" at 16:20 had the exact same energy as the "why is it spicy" meme. This man is hilarious
the super salty saltier-than-salt thing is called salmiak liquorice, we have it here in the netherlands too and i used to shovel that shit down by the handful as a child LOL
Since when did Jack Sparrow start reviewing candy? Not that I'm complaining!
At 4:58 it's hillarious to me that Mark said confidently that it was Icelandic even though there's a picture of the Swedish flag on the front
The Melody Pop tune will forever be stuck in my head
can someone make a list so we can know which ones are actually from Iceland? please
years
A few of these candies we have in Sweden. But I don't know where they originated from.
Mark has been good with cameras for a long time, but lately his videos are getting even better, his lens obsession is paying off. It's nice to see a person you enjoy watching grow and get even better at what they do. Keep up mark ❤️ Edit: 1:36 Mark's maze should be made out of Minolta lenses, floating in the Space.
FINALLY A REVIEW VIDEO :D
OMG IM SO EARLY FOR ONCE
Isn't ammonium chloride just sour salt
I like how to this day, his mind is still thoughts of space.
i missed amy :)
Volcanic chaos gotta love it
I want that jacket.
Anyone with misophonia (hatred of chewing sounds) - actually died during this video. Because they must watch this video because Mark but... the pain.
thr pin ball candy is german too
I’ve been watching this for 20 when i realized this was published 32 mins ago… I THOUGHT THIS WAS LIKE A YEAR OLD!!
I love the fnaf person 💅💗
Mark is starting to look like Jin Sakai.
Tyrkisk Peber oh no
Hearing mark chew the Dust is total ASMR
MARK REVIEWS
Mark!! Try Hungarian candies, trust me
the second candy is swedish its not icelandic
"There is no such things as volcanoes" Markiplier never fails to come up with the most ridiculous things out there 😂😂
Mark and his invisible friend Lixian :]
Mark has a scar on his nose
I love any Moam sweets, but theyre german not icelandic but theyre everywhere in UK.   Screw licorice tho
Oh hai... marks not dead from bruises!
I am from iceland here is the authentic candy: 1,3,5,9,12,13,15,17,21 Plus I can confirm iceland has cats and Akureyri has alot of them, some say a cat problem.
patiently waiting for an italian candy review
I’m only three minutes into this video and I already love it
I went to Iceland this year and I saw cats there was one in the gift stores and I saw a couple on the streets
I'm still never going to forgive you for how you ate Takis. But you still make great videos so I'll continue watching your stuff. Just never eat a taki on video ever again, please.
Why mark always wear the bandana now
🇫🇮 Tyrkisk Peber and the other candies from Fazer are actually from Finland and all of them taste excellent 🇫🇮
So Tyrkisk Pepper has salmiakk/salamiak in it, that's the nasty you bit into. It's a very popular flavor in liquorice among the Scandinavian countries.
I'm not complaining, but I am in awe due to the camera work, especially the zooming, which made the breach inside mark's huberus way more immersive
10:13 That’s actually so funny to me, cuz as an icelandic i view American food safety standards as worse than ours. U guys have so much unhealthy sjit its crazy
So many Swedish candys🤣
POST FNAF OR ELSE I'LL UNFOLLOW
I like how Mark went in to buy Icelandic candy and then he picks the obvious Swedish one. It has the flag on it. He should know what the Icelandic flag looks like when he's in Iceland since it would be everywhere. 😅
I love the confused chewing lol.
If you think it's Swedish why don't you just call pewds and send him a picture and ask? 6:30
Mark playing the flute candy is so iconic
i mean i have never seen a volcano in person and mark would never lie too us right??? so volcanoes must not be real
Good god i love mark so much he is so funny!
The whistle in between the candies was amazing
Alternate title: Mark reviews licorice
As a Resident of New Jersey I can attest that this is indeed Authentic Icelandic Candy.
When will you ever do Swedish candy?
“I don’t want that in me anymore.” -Mark-eh-plier  26:47
I want to see a mark review of different brands of hotpockets
Me checking what icelandic people are saying in the comments to see how Mark did
I love these review videos.
The same year i’ve been continuing to learn the icelandic language 😅
Plain. Air. Sky
Mark there is game call kinitoPET its a horror game    Totally not will hack your computer 😊
*E  A  T*
I missed this content soooo much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
makirpleier 👍👍
"Very sneaky"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
J 🪑
i just want to let markiplier know that the candy bar thats called jólaköttur is a Christmas themed candy and yes we do have cats lots and lots of cats
i entered his mind 3 times
Markiplier is one of the best candy reviewers, even if it isnt his intention
53,948th view.
I want to see Mark eat some Polish snacks like Paluszki and Ptasie Mleczko🇵🇱
The second candy is Swedish "Härligt gott från Gränna" means "lovely good(as in tasty) from Gränna", Gränna is a town in between Stockholm and Göteborg(Gothenburg).
Mark there is game call kinitoPET its a horror game    Totally not will hack your computer 😊
The candy is great but MAN I love that jacket you're wearing Mark. Looks good on you too! Also Chica in the background getting up while you did the whistle candy was funny 😂
I was watching this and thought to myself "it would be fun to see mark eat finnish candy" and to my surprise, I was delivered <3 Fazer my beloved.
I like how this is recorded the way an interview with a mentally ill patient in a documentary would be.
Balls
"i dont want that in me anymore" - mark 2k24
I did a Christmas in iceland thing for school and the cat is actually in iceland folklore. The cat will eat you if you don't get a new piece of clothing by the end of Christmas :)
the whistle transitions are sending me
I Am From Iceland This Is Amazing By Watching You experience My Country Candy BTW Love You,r Video Mark Keep It Up!!
Cuteee! 😂 Mark trying to spell the names of the candies remindes me of him trying to speak portuguese!! Pure comedy
mark go to Finland an try salmiakki do it
Its funny how I searched up, "Markiplier horror games" and the first thing that popped up was this video.
The first candy (Jólakötturinn) is actually named after a cat from Icelandic folklore, said cat would devour anyone who didn't get any new clothes for Christmas (so yeah that part about Icelandic fairytales being dark is pretty accurate) I enjoyed this video a lot as an Icelandic person, it's always entertaining to see people try to pronounce Icelandic words Thank you for the laughs, Mark!
As Dane I am appauled he implied we speak Dutch T_T
0:32 me when bro tells me its 9 inches
Mark is the William Shatner of YouTube ‼️🐐
Maoam is not icelandtic. Its a off Brand of Haribo so its german for me 🇩🇪
YOUR TELLING ME I COULD HAVE MET YOU 😭😭😭😭
🇳🇴 Flag of Norway is me
Hvar er maltið
I've been waiting for another video like this
Mark might have insulted the entire Icelandic population with the Opal 😂😂
RAMBO?!?!
Has mark tried Philippine candy before? Or am I misremembering
The locals thought Jack Sparrow popped by for a visit
Mark kinda looks like Jack sparrow without his hat in this video
THE LENS! SO CLEAR!
No way Mark is doing reviews again! I thought I wad late an that train.
Lmao það er svo goofy að hlusta a útlendinga reyna að bera fram Íslensk orð/nöfn
Icelandic: jólaköttur, trítlar, stjörnurúlla, súpersett,  opal, djöflar, þristur, and lakkrísrör ❤ .. tho not sure about the last one hope you enjoyed iceland mark n amy!
marks trainer is gonna hear from this one
markerplier should reviewer marks.
Lol
Nobody has yet watched the full video but there are so many commmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmments here
Oh good solid snake started his food review channel
I love how mark was making fun of the bubblegum dust, despite one of his favourite things being the dust from takis lmaoo
pinballs and whistle are propably are all around europe, childhood candies
well didn’t except THIS
A WHISTLE POP OMG 😭😭Last time i had one i was thrown from the back seat of a car into the passenger floorboard (because my mom hit a deer and i was in a seatbelt) and i cried because my whistle pop got dirty 😂
I am from Iceland and I made a TIKTok shorts With a guy who met you Markiplier. He's the store guy in the Pokémon Store. in Akureyri he told me you bought some candy in there.
Mom wake up mark is reviewing candy again  Mom why aren't you moving?
I love that there is a swedish flag on the bag and he just says (05:01) ”im willing to bet that this is actually authentic”  (Gränna is a town in sweden famous for candy canes)
where is sons of the forest
I hope this is a true review and not a taki type of review
A REVIEW?? OMGGG
THAT WHISTLE EFFECT BETWEEN THE CANDIES  😄 😄 😄 HAD ME ROLLIN'
"the day where Markiplier post is a better day for the world."- I heard it somewhere probably
Oh snap, i was binging Mark's older review videos, and then he uploads a new one. WWIOOOOOO. I love this series!
Get this guy a melody pop band, that tune was incredible
IM AFRAID OF LOSING YOU TOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I was literally just rewatching some of the old review videos so this was perfect timing lmao
wish all food reviews had zoomed in faces of agony and despair
note: Gränna is indeed in Sweden, Located next to the 2nd largest lake "Vättern".
When Mark pulled out that Tyrkisk Peber, all the Danes watching knew exactly what was coming. 😂  Edit: The Skolekridt too! 🤣
Day 16 of asking mark to bring back the raft series
I love these Mark reviews we had one in so long
It sure has been a while since Mark's last review of something. Quite the refresher.
the melody pop is german candy
Hi mark!
Can we take a moment to appreciate the little candy jingle that Mark made from an actual piece of candy?! It’s surprisingly catchy and good!
Chupa chup whistles! I haven't seen one of those since like the first grade!
I wonder how Amy feels when Mark starts talking to Lixian even though he isn't there
Mark casually eating ammonium chloride is so funny to me idk
Okay hi Swedish person here and the second candy is from Sweden! It from the magical place of Gränna which is known for making different hard candies since 1859 and it was started by a woman!  Some unnecessary lore maybe but if you ever visit Sweden I recommend checking it out it's a wonderful experience 🥹
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I've missed these videos omd and I'm so happy to see this
fazer and turkisk pepper is turkin pippuri from finland and the center is salmiakki or salted liquorice, its very good and popular in here
im not a fan of licorice myself mark, actually i hate it
Holy shit, Toot Sweets are real!?
Try brazillian candy! We have the best ones!
I love how amy is just watching mark talk to his imaginary friend in the beginning
10:35-10:44 it's so memeable 🤣🤣🤣
Oh, we used to have those flute candy in Switzerland :D I loved it as a kid
seeing marks hope and joy leave his body while he tastes some of these is the most entertaining aspect
im from iceland this is great!
Iceland does in fact have cats Source: I have 2 cats
LETS GOOOO ICELAND MENTIONED 🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸🇮🇸❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️ ÍSLAND
HELP I'M TRAPPED 3 LAYERS DEEP IN MARK'S MIND AND IT'S SCARY AND CONFUSING IN HERE
✨
this video is so sweet :D
Mark’s performance on the recorder was a truly magical experience XP
22:54 Socker means sugar, btw
I love that ALL the candy from sweden is the ones you didnt like.. And I love them! xD
Idk why but the Jack Sparrow vibes are strong in this video
Yesss i really like candy 🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒🍒
Mark is officially the best candy whistler on YouTube
lethal company was one of the best series on mark's channel.  i felt spoiled watching those and wasn't prepared for another food review  thank you for making me and many others happy.
A REVIEW?!! ITS BEEN SO LONG
that whistle candy is just TootSweets from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
ngl, the jingle absolutely made it. 10/10 amazing review
I thought he wasn't making anymore Markiplier reviews videos
I will do 2 push ups for every like this comment gets
HOW DARE YOU COMPARE MY COUNTRY TO THE FILTH KNOWN AS SWEEDEN OR NORWAY?!?!?!?
Hockey pulver iirc is a Swedish "candy".
The second candy is Swedish. Raspberry and licorice is a very popular flavour combination here.
Those who listen to Go My Favorite Sports Team know the story about the beginning of this video :)
I wonder if Mark was aware how actually close Amy was recording him in the second camera, because he said that was the point but…was it? Or was Amy just doing it for the fun of it😂
Markiplier reviews are my happy place, thank you Mark
9:29 mark educates us about manufacturing
4:36 good ol' Google translate gave me this: "hearty goodness from the alley" in Swedish apparently
chica coming to see what was up with the melody pop
"Dont bite into it" imediatly starts chewing it
Been waiting for this video since Mark mentioned it on distractible.
the whistling between each candy killed me😂
"Not my grandma, my grandma is" me: thinking he's gonna said dead. "Korean"
I had to pop open my bag of twizzler bites. Thanks for the reminder Mark!
Man, I really want to go to Iceland.
Now that 2024 was started for been 28 days, most of us are changed to a better new look. And so Mark sparrow.
Iceland does have cats, and the Christmas cat is a part of our folklore
The slide whistle candy both got my dog's attention and reminded me of Twilight Princess.
that whistle sounded like " the sounds of space" lmao
Why does Markiplier look like a Pirate?
The close-ups.....😅😂. Like he discovered something cool and then realizes it's not what it was and that it was a bad idea to discover it.  Every close-up this video has, I cracked up Everytime.
I’m so glad you went to Iceland. And yes! Their candies are unique (most known for their licorice). I enjoyed most, the chocolates. There are really good brand named candies from there. I loved our travels, a few years ago, to that country and it’s absolutely beautiful there!😊  There were plenty of cats there too. xD They go in and out of some shops freely as if they too are a customer in some of the main cities and towns such as Reykjavík.
i really enjoy seeing mark review stuff.
why's the flag wrongway around in the thumbnail..?
15:00 FINLAND YEAH
Is that the Swedish flag He says. My mind: OF COURSE IT IS
15:34 mark is the only one too hot to handle
As a person on this earth, I can confirm there is no such thing as volcanos
PLS TRY CANDY FROM FINLAND
BEFORE AN HOUR TEAM
WE LOVE THE COMPANY
12,001st
Hi
oh those human shaped gummies are horrendous
markiplier is like if eddievr and keanu reeves had a love child
Best darn Melody Pop player in the West!
The only thing that I love about pandemic was the long hair Markiplier it gave us
basically all of it is icelandic except the raspberry one which obv had the swedish flag on it lmao and the uk chewing gum powder as well is not from iceland or tyrkisk peber is not icelandic basically mark is wrong about most of it being from iceland only some of it is
I’ve been waiting for another one of these videos. But I somehow did not know it.
i was literally just watching the old food review videos, and then this one came out LMAO
Ah yes. An asmr video.
As an Icelandic person I approve this review
I’m surprised Mark has never seen powdered gum. I used to get it at 7 Eleven all the time as a kid. I felt like it was everywhere when we were little.
those first gummies look like those candy sharks Mark!
15:05  Torilla…? Eiku hmm… eiku
30 minute gang 👇
4:33 and he whips out an clearly Swedish candy thinking its icelandic XD (just look at our flag!) And almost saying thw cities name right. A+
The whistle should be Markiplier's new outro
Mark always doing something unexpected
ÍSLAND GAMLA ÍSLAND
Watching this while eating tyrkisk peber :,(
15:15 FAZERBLAST (im sorry, i like fnaf way too much)
NOT THE FAZER-.. It's literally from Finland 😂😂
15:58 oh no. Don't bi... and he bit it. 😂
Hey mark, do you eat your lollipops, or do you enjoy them?
"Are those nipples?" -Markiplier 2024
Let me tell you this much Mark, You have definitely dappled in mostly Nordic candies. :D that amonium thing is actually just salmiac
YOU WERE IN ICELAND, AND I DIDNT KNOW. I’m DEEPLY SADDENED. ONLY CHANCE ID EVER GET TO MEET HIM, GONE
PLS DO ROMANIAN CANDY NEXT!!
Egg Secretly Tastes Like Apple You Just Think It Tastes Like Egg.
*laughs at american food safety standards as a german*
Ah gränna, I visited there once. Was a fun place.
I LOVE UR VIDEOSS
Great video
nOICe
MORE! FOOD! REVIEWS!
so much love to lixian he always makes these videos so much better
The Slidewhistle candy is a W
Mark implied vs surstromming when?
I saw the gas can and knew immediately it was gum lol we use to have that same powder gum here in America too. I grew up with it.
As a swedish person I can confirm that the second candy did have the swedish flag and swedish text on it
I went to Iceland five years ago, and it was one of the best places I've traveled to! My family and I explored the city of Reykjavik, and there was so much to see - and lots of food to try! And I kid you not, they had the BEST hot dogs I'd ever eaten! (Yes, I know that sounds silly when I word it like that, but trust me - they're OUTSTANDING.)
its not icelandic candy if it isnt hard to open
Hello everybody my name is Welcome     What?     W e l c o m e     Markiplayer
The content we all needed and wasn't aware of!!
4:10 fun fact! Dogs were banned in Reykjavik until 1984, and most pet owners had/have cats. I saw a cat around basically every corner when I was there in 2020. Interesting what different people pick up on and see.
Markiplier ( Enter my Mind ).  Enters - Exits.  Me ( There was nothing in there but FNAF Chika and Pink Moustaches ).
Norway now
Hi Mark! Love you❤ thank you for all you do!
huh, this security breach episode is kinda weird
YESSSSS ANOTHER REVEIW, LETS START ANOTHER FEUD
4:40 I really thought he was going to say "My grandma IS DEAD"😂😂
My mom was walk;ng past me watching this video and she thought you were a pope
As an icelandic, I’m so excited to see this video. Candy here slaps
I’m Iceland it makes me so happy he’s reviewing it lol!
Great asmr mark, thanks ❤️
14:26  After Eight best chocolate brand 🔥 🎉
Markception 😎
‘It’s all liquorice?’ “Always has been”
I feel blessed by experiencing an Markiplier reviews,its been so long
32:51 this HAS to be a new meme GIF
Mark Can you pleas do danish candy at uuuuhhhh some point idk
The Fazer Tyrkisk Peber is Finnish, so you were right about it not being Icelandic
Wait wait wait. . . .he always ends up in hospital after doin the nommy nom nom vids. Always.
25:03 27:27 Lixian's comedic timing will forever get me.

Oh yeah Review markiplier is back baby

FINNISH HERE SOME OF FAZER'S TYRKISK PEBER ARE GOOD AS HELL

Another markipiler review 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🙌🙌🙌🙌🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶

I am happy to be trapped in your mind forever mark
NEW DAY ,NEW MARK VIDEO REVIEW?!! OHHHH BOII THIS IS ALWAYS THE BEST . Mark is the type pf person that he's THE CEO Of The BEST MAN EVER SEEN. BIG BIG RESPECT
Lol I've been anticipating this video since Mark mentioned it on distractible
"Hjärtligt från Gränna" Yes, the *swedish flag* is a sure sign this is truly 100% icelandic candy.
about the volcano thing...
Mark reviewing candy is something I never knew I needed. The pink whistle candy is by far the best.
Gränna is in Sweden, not Iceland. And the text on the package was also in Swedish. Damnit Mark.
You went to Iceland? You went to Iceland and i didn't know?! God damn it, I missed my chance to meet you 🥲
Finally, the foretold Icelandic candy episode
Wow this milk tastes so good, where did it come fr- 5:01
the intro is pure beauty
Marks little marklets are marketing markiplier Iceland candy.
There's no such thing as volcanoes. They don't exist. It's all a lie.
OMGG LIXIAN SIGHTING
Um.... I don't know how to break this to you, but.... Tyrkish Peber is actually Finnish
Mark entering his "looking homeless" phase!
hi mark how are you doing (I'm not Icelandic i just wanted to say hi)
If you want to develop a strong preference for licorice, then you should try Finnish sweets, they put licorice in almost anything and everything
Sour Patch Kids are going to find him again just you wait
Truly a review
Tyrkisk peber is swedish
The amount of unique faces mark makes in this video kills me
this came outta nowhere
*Milk* chocolate? From abused icelandic cows? no thanks.
all these closeups of marks face are gonna make me BUST
Well how everyone I was here first 18secs so yea
FNAF part 13 when?!!??
Damn 15 minutes ago
wheres help wanted 2
Mark: *opens a bag of candy that literally has the Swedish flag on it*  Also Mark: "I'm willing to bet that this is actually authentic."  He never disappoints. 😂😂😂
1st one is just Choco Mucho
after so long, finally another review video. We have been blessed, guys
No way that jerry can candy is from tha UK lol. I've lived here all my life, seen and tried so many candies and never seen that lol.
i love mark's tasting videos.
MARKS REVIEWING AGAIN!!!!!!!
"Enter my mind for eternity" Only -Monika- Mark
We need Mexican candy mark!!!!
You should try South African candy🙂
Markiplier must try South African Candy
lixian is so done 😭
25th time asking for ultrakill, neon white and cruelty squad
Today I learned that "vim" is a word. It means enthusiasm, energy.
Pls play Wolfenstein the new order
I missed this series!!
Who else expected lethal company/help wanted 2
YAYYYY
I loveeee youuuu markkkyyyyy🤍
This is probably my favorite intro.
oh I love the raspberry grandma candy things, I usually get them for christmas and they are super good
Seeing Mark try authentic Icelandic candy is a sight to behold!
real
"Its been so long!!!!"                             -the living tombstone
15:14 good danish mark
as a fellow Icelander i can confirm Lakkrís is disgusting
This better get added to the "Markiplier Reviews" playlist
Mark, is it me or have you changed? (Btw, thank you for not retiring)
Yes finally some good fucking food, yknow how long ive wanted for a review or non gameplay mark vid
Markiplier is trying one candy from every continent and he'll end the series by eating Arctic ice
MARK ARE YOU DOING REVIEW'S AGAIN?
i am here, you cannot prove i am there
the second candy is swedish its even the swedish language
i may have a big sensory thing with chewing but damnit its markiplier
So calm.
I missed these kinds of videos It made me the happiest little man when I saw the notification
Trapped in Markiplier's mind forevar
(7:06)
I thought it was gonna be help wanted 2
Dude looks like crew member on the black pearl
14 mins lol
11:02 My god, that was so close to being a different word💀
I'm stuck in the Markrooms guys, any tips?
As a Icelandic person it’s cool seeing you eat are candyyy! ❤
Candy all day
why he always wearing that on the head
W
The first candy is actually based of a icelandic christmas myth so yes it is authentic
he is back with reviewing
LMAO
I was going to sleep, guess not anymore
Mark looks like he could play Captain Jack Sparrow
i cant believe im actually learning about how gum is made in a markiplier video
yeah yeahuhhhh
Mark looking like that one woman with the sword on The Walking Dead.
Jólaköttur = Christmas cat - In old Icelandic lore the cat eats people  We Vikings are masters in the candy business
Fun fuct: did you know that Markiplier was Korean. Well he wasn't born in Korean but his mom was Korean. He was born the the USA. But if you look at Markiplier face then you can tell that he is Korean.                 Who's believe my fact?👇
sweden mentioned RAHHHHHHHHHH
I love the review videos from Mark, best review format on YT!
The head band is everything
anyone including me has not yet fully experienced this video at the moment when commenting…
MARK NO RETIRING JOKES PLS
Marks mind has been entered 😂💫
A few minutes ago I was joking about something about Markiplier talking to my family and then I get a notification that he posted a video
Alright 3 layers in marks mind and we are in candy land 😂
We love you Iceland!
best youtuber ever
Second one is actually swedish from the town Gränna :) you got the flag right.
HI MAKRIPLUER
i wish markiplier was real 😔
Getting the news about the Vulcano  And I’m like “Oh God !!”  But my Icelandic friend is like “oh… they evacuated, they prepared for this day” And I’m like “DuDE what!? how are you so Calm!?”   Also skolekridt is from my neck of the Woods and they are awful! Licorice is devil’s candy volcano dust in your mouth and No! I’ll not change my mind
i love how mark just trusts lixian to make everything better 😂
Why does he look like a modern day Captain Jack Sparrow
must Markiplier be reviewer of the year
Hi baby 😄
try British chocolate
Hi
This is was not on my bingo card…and I’m loving it😭🤣
finally, traditional content
As a swedish person, I got mad very fast because of Mark's opinion on licorice
Ok but I need to see him try Mexican candy. I think that would be very interesting lol
people who are watching from a toxic waste barrel  👇
I see mark's in his biker dad era
Mark you look like you could replace Jonny depp in pirates of the Caribbean
good
The Minolta lenses are finally getting used
What's going on Mark. You growing a third eye under that bandana? Did all the Icelandic Candy mutant you?
His intro was perfection, his YouTube experience is truly shining.
0:13 9/11
Thank god there aren’t volcanos. I always assumed one would kill me eventually. I feel much better now.   Also… I will never escape.
Mr beast
Mark never fails to have the most random video ideas
I dont wanna enter your mind mark,id be dead in the span of 2 seconds
How do people say they liked the video if they commented like 1 minute after the publish when the video is 49 minutes long...
i like your videos. keep up the good work
How does your personal trainer feel about this Mark?
"I have good news, it's not blue licorice"  *3 seconds later *  "I have bad news"
Ayy this'll be damn fun!
that was the most catastrophic intro i have ever seen
Its always a joy to see mark and lixian interacting. 😂
It is indeed the Swedish flag, the hard raspberry/licorice candies from the bag is from Sweden. From Gränna a town which is famous for it's candy canes and candy.  The "nipples" are mushrooms, and made in Sweden, so is the Hockey Pulver. It contains Salmiak, which is that unidentifyable salty flavour... The Tyrkisk Peber is from Finland.
If they are going to do more pirates of the Caribbean they should cast Markiplier
He talked about this on distractible and I was literally thinking “I wonder when it’s gonna be released” literally yesterday 🤣 and now it’s here!
I bet real icelandic “anything” tastes like the air “tastes” there. A rotten egg. You get used to it of course just like you do to breathing there.  Edit: though… I do hope this isn’t true
I'd be fine floating in Mark's mind.
Ngl I missed this content
Yesss! Markiplier reviews is back 💪
please tell me I'm not the only one who sees captain jack sparrow 😂😂
I'm early wth!?!?!
I love marks discount jack Sparrow look
Pls play more Fnaf
Is the candy from iceland?
Mark reviewing candy is such a classic :)
As someone from Iceland, the first one? I've never seen that before but its also probably a christmas exclusive and I'm almost certain its real, also we have cats in Iceland you just wouldnt see them outside Mark....Also theres a cat on it because of the myth about the cat that eats children, its a whole christmas thing or whatever. The second one, yeah the words on there arent icelandic and you can also see the Swedish flag on there so uh yeah. (But I can confirm its still a common candy here) Tritlar, the third one is definetly from Iceland, I think? To my knowledge? The thing basically said "Wicked good double layered fruit jelly"    I dont feel like writing anymore, 😅
It’s been a while since mark reviewed stuff
that whole intro is the most adhd thing ever and i love it

Marketpliers
Hi I hope you're having a good day
Pure facts
Lixian IS amazing!
Finally another review video
meow meow meow meow
Amazing video as always!
I MISSED THESE VIDEOS
*Buys Swedish Candy* *Eats Swedish Candy* *Sees Swedish flag on Candy* "Yeah Totally Icelandic"  You Goddamn Hawaiians!
(candy package literally has sweden's flag on it)  Mark: I think this is icelandic!!
𝚝𝚑𝚒𝚜 𝚒𝚜 𝚗𝚒𝚌𝚎.
Got surprised to see this only uploaded a few minutes ago! Been watching a lot of Mark's videos as of late so it was nice to watch something like this again :)
The cat actually is Icelandic it’s folk lore (the Yule Cat)
Awesome Mark hasn't stopped the review videos but I still think he won't get the sponsorship from any of them still.
That was infact, the swedish flag
Omg the start 😂
Comment
Being in marks mind is very amusing
1:45 going to the Scandinavian drama lighting really selling it
Hi markiplier I am a huge fan
i genuinely love Mark's reviews because of how unhinged and chaotic it always gets. it's just pure improv, chaos and adhd distilled into a long delicious video
love to see captain mark sparrow here
6:55 what kind of harry potter spell was that
I love how Mark just looks off to the side and trusts that Lixian will edit himself in 😭
E
MARKIPLIER REVIEW AHAHAHGSGWHAH YAAAAAAAY
this may be the first time i see a video posted under 20 minutes ago
YES A REVIEW
Early
I hope this won't be followed again by a video from the hospital..
Yes finally a review video again.  This absolutely made my day :)
i started watching the video 3 minutes ago and its cool to think since this just came out im watching this at the exact same time as a thousand other people
Way to try and avoid a natural disaster just to be safe 😂
I love Markiplier ASMR
"You're not gonna make it past 6" without context is awful
marks the best 👍
Mark is THE icelandic candy review channel.
Bats eyelashes
Mark I love your videos they bring me joy in hard times I'm going through thank you for everything
Eight minutes ago and 900 comments😂
5:53 yes Mark that is the Swedish flag
Markiplooper
Lets gooooooooo🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Love how clear mark looks through that $100k Minolta lens
When he’s trying to pronounce the words I honestly think it’s the funniest part of the whole video😂😂😂
0 hesitation on the first bite.. impressive mark
I missed this series
Twizzlers are Satan’s veins. They’re disgusting. Red vines 4Lyfe. Also the innuendoes at @28:16 are just astounding.
I thought he was gonna say “not my grandma, my grandma is dead”
it’s not a bag of taki’s mark
Well there is the giant cat that eats people that don't get clothes for christmas
Early!!!! 18 minutes!!!!🎉
No way he brought reviews back
I love his headband phase 😂
I Watched this within 6 minutes of upload but the video is 49 mins long LIKE THIS DAMMIT  😄
amazing to see mark in irl videos again.
AHHH I'M EARLYYY!! KEEP UP THE WORK MARKIEEE
What is mark doing in Iceland. Do I need to catchup on the podcast that badly?
Putting this on while I eat lunch to pretend like I’m eating with him
Review next finnish candy ;p
i watch mark eat food so i feel less hungry so i can save money every month
I cannot believe I'm this early! Its been a while since we've seen another video like this!
i love how mark just decided that theres absolutely 0 cats in the entire country of iceland, hes so right tho obviously
Hell yea I was watching old videos of Mark and he post a new video perfect timing
Gotdamn you look majestic Mark.
Love all of this
Yes new markipler video
"theres no such thing as volcanos"  yes mark i agree. wholeheartedly.
“This is the day you will always remember as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow.”
ITS BEEN SO LONG SINCE THE LAST MARK REVIEWW
He should review Portuguese candy just for lixian 🎉🎉🎉
mind entered.
That is in fact the Swedish flag
Me when
man i lve these vids
Watching Mark then Mark Posted
0:20 disaster? I hardly know her 0:35 better? I hardly know her 0:36 over? I hardly know her 0:37 enter? I hardly know her 0:37 vigor? I hardly know her
Do Albania 🇦🇱!
Candy

I’ve been wanting a video like this for so long!!
i love these kinds of videos, honestly miss the videos where Mark reviewed products.
🙈eating the cruchy stuff today mark. Just give me a basic us Twizzler with a coffee cake ill be good rockon mark😎👍
hiiii  😆
Casual darkiplier at the beginning 😭
I would like to suggest something, try food from norway, like brown cheese and the beloved chocolate 'Smash'
Day 111 of asking Mark to play Dredge
Under 1 hour gang.
poaswen
second one is swedish
Does it taste like ice
Yay irl mark!
Please try German candy!
So cool
Another review videoooo
no way he actually did iceland???? and its 6 min ago
Person from Iceland here, they are all authentic
I heard a word plane and sky... 0:10
nice to see we’re turning to our roots of mark trying random things
The cinematic language of this video is a thing to be studied
I’m in Iceland
Is their anyway the viewers might be able to talk to you or like a discord sever?
Hey mark u prob won’t see this but if possible revisit pasmaphobia with the bois pls also I just saw the trailer u rlly should play zoochosis when it comes out
3 layers deep in mark’s mind and he still thinking of volcanoes
Peak of content making its comeback🗣🗣💯💯🐐
No one finished this video yet
LETS GO A FOOD REVIEW
Can we talk about how pretty mark is??
I'm the happiest Icelandic person to ever exist rn
I’ll start a yt channel if this gets 100 likes
Mark doing doo rags. He be hip with the kids. Like five night's at freak boys 2. Anyone remember that? 😂
Not my grandma. My grandma...is Korean
I live for the random review videos Mark makes.
Hi!
Anyone else he's starting to look more and more like johnny Depp or os that just me 😂😂😂😂
Hi😮
Wawo
i’ve been waiting for another food/candy review 😭
YIPPEE i've missed this!!!!
The disgust on his face of the second lol
After a year, we've gotten another markipler review video, YIPPEE!!!  Also I just want to mention that the whole production value of mark's videos has increased so much, the lighting and general camera quality is very, very nice.
Love It Mark Markiplier Bro.
"But am I wrong?" Yes, let him volcano.
Nice
The first candy translated into chistmas cat which we do have
it has been a year since the last review i am so happy that  we have a new one
another mark review we won fr
I first read the title as “I Reviewed Icelandic iCarly”. 💀
Who needs a Gordon Ramsay review when we got Mark?
Unrelated to the video but i posted a very informative mewing tutorial (100% helpful will help become low ball swanger and gangster like mark the plier)
I love it when mark reviews things
Iceland is one of the few things I'd never associate with Mark, Good to broaden your Horizons I suppose  I have 4 nipples by the way hehe
FINALLY ANOTHER REVIEW
12,995 views in 5 minutes is insane
6 MINS AGOO
The editing is superb, props to Lixian for being a master class editor.
jólaköttur is the christmas cat that is from Icelandic folklore and it’s definitely candy from iceland (I’m from Iceland btw)
I’m getting gummy candy from overseas from the UK and I’m gonna get it sometime this week and I am excited!
We'll never know what the volcano thing is
Markiplier always make everyone's day happier and joyful :D
Holy shit never saw this video coming as an icelander
Well, as i watched this man pondering about a banana... i enjoyed this very much... Germany next? From the lovely  bavarian town of Fischbach? Maybe...?😅
I will do 1 gazillion pushups if I get 1000000 likes
four minutes! im finally not a day late!
Mark can you please play Granny again there's been so many updates since you last played
im so early?
YESS ANOTHER MARK CANDY REVIEW. he actually talked about almost making volcano jokes in this video on Distractible. by the way, I think that candy coated licorice was called "School Chalk"
Ishelondic condi ree-vieww
Haven’t seen a Markiplier review in a long time, never been happier to see one
hi

♥️♥️♥️
I'm finally early to a markiplier video lol
I love you mark :)
Wsg
i love marks reviews on things, very distinct
I like the first part introducing
There is a video in your intro
I will bench 1 gram per like on this comment
With all the chaos in the first few minutes, I started to doubt whether Mark would ever get around to actually tasting the candy
I'm liking the whole 'Terminator Resistance Fighter' outfit Mark is going with, very stylish!
This is fun
DON'T TELL ALEX
YOOO HE POSTED
WAKE UP HONEY, MARK POSTED ANOTHER REVIEW!!!!!!
🎉
Yes.
I bet some people took the opportunity to enter Mark's mouth while entering his mind
try expired candy
I miss these videos so much thank you 😭
My friend is from iceland.     That is all.
As Chaotic as always with the intro.
Mark im waiting for that movie.
Whow this is about to be a breeze
Mark: there’s no such things as Volcanoes   Me: (from Hawaiʻi where Volcanoes absolutely exist) 🤔
you know its a good day when mark uploads.
With the awesome hair and bandana, Mark will slowly transform into Hulk Hogan
YO I WAS JUST IN ICELAND FOR VACATION LIKE TWO WEEKS AGO!
👍🏽
DO MORE FOOD REVIEWS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES! I really enhoy this series, and as always YOU LOOK AWESOME! ❤
After all this time. Another Markiplier Review!
Mark trying every candy that he likes or doesn't like, good content of choice 🌟👍
God this is about to be good
hi mark
1:58 i totally agree
Hraun on top
Can you review Swedish candy?? It’s SO GOOD
He’s not real
mark spoiling us with the 4k quality.

WOOOOO A MARKIPLIER CANDY REVIEW 👏
Man's back.The best reviewer ever😂😂😂
hi
39:21 it’s not hot
the return of the reviews who knew this day would come
can u try danish candy next?
as someone who wants to move to iceland, i was ecstatic to watch this
Mark never fails to review stuff
Like how 3 mins 3k likes
Am I really going to watch close ups of a grown man eating candy and mispronouncing them all...yes...yes I am
Icelandic candy lol... Norwegian candy is of course better❤️🇳🇴 but Icelandic candy is alrite...i liked this video Markimoo, Lixian & Amymoo & cute dogs 🐕 🐕 yes!!!!👍😅
Ah I love Amy she’s so funny and cute mark you found a gem
lol
Mark knows the secrets of the universe, but he made an oath with god to keep it a secret.
Im from iceland and i am so proud of that you did this video
Markiplier ❤❤❤
Iceland mentioned!!🇮🇸🇮🇸🔛🔝🔥🔥🗣🗣
I dont think Mark is real. Over the last month he's looked the same in every episode of Distractible and every video he posts.
Mark is like that one guy you know with like 10 personailties and you never know what to expect from him and his personalities
day 2 of letting mark know his long hair is giving daddy energy
This is so cool!
Here in 2 minutes lol
I love you so much mark your such a good YouTuber and tell tinny box Tim I said hi ❤❤
Bread 🍞

The day turn from sad to amazing (I’m at a funeral)
yippy yippy yippy
First 1000 comments :) (I think)  BRO I SWEAR IF MARK SEES THIS I WILL FUCKING DIE IF HE SEES MY CHANNEL NAME AND MY VIDEOS I WILL IMMEDIATELY PASS AWAY I SWEAR I DONT WANT ANYONE SEEING IT
mark is so sexy (i’m not gay)
the way i genuinely JUMPED when i saw the notification i'm so happy 😭
How is there so many comments already lol
Islan
A video with Amy is always a hit
Mark always puts 100% effort in his intros ❤
Love how he always relies on lixian,  and Amy thinks he's crazy talking to the wall.
Love you Mark! I love your videos they really make my day❤
Great choice to remove the mind volcanos, i almost got burnt 🔥
I went into marks mind and all I saw was boat dog
↓↓ Early
hi mark! thank you for the video! would you please be able to use your platform to speak up about  palestine? it would  be  much appreciated
When the world needed him most, Mark delivered.

Take three on going into marks mind
“What do you mean it’s a little close?”👁️👄👁️
I heard about Mark being in Iceland but getting a vlog out of it? Hell yes.
Yummy (:
