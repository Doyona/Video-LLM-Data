The rest of the world hopefuly doesn't put their elbow on the table.
😂😂😂
I guess my mom has some explaining to do.
“Pull me up” is indeed the perfect name if you eat it like that. The only question is where?  Of the couch or into heaven?😂
Double approved!
Já comi algumas vezes em meu país e nao achei nada demais. Esquecível...
nanana, rainboots to eat all of it, no matter the crumbles nor the mess
So basically how I eat icecream during summer.
Io amo ❤
Tragones
I didn't know I was italian...
😂😂😂😂😂😂
I wish I could that big tiramisu😋😋😋😋
There goes the diet!😅
As a none italian this is approved.
I mean consirdering price on that dessert I'm surprised that Italians can afford such. Expensive addiction
Hey why didn’t I see this before entering the shop?
In this case I am Italian 😂
I really don’t like tiramisu, it does nothing for me 🤷🏻‍♀️
I guess I have Italian soul 😂 I just LOOOVE TIRAMISU!! It’s my favourite dessert. And when someone tells me they don’t love it, it’s a big NOT APPROVED for me 😆
nr 1 dessert in the world, and i can eat a bucket of it.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Tiramisu is the best!! Wish it had fewer calories though!😢😢😢
Meter la cuchara en medio de la carretilla en vez de empezar por una esquina me da TOC

Diabetes++++++++++++++ Death+++++++++++++ Respect+++++++++ 😂😂😂😂

One thing in italy i dont like
Oh, Madon'! A barrowful of tiramisu, yes please! Very much approved-a!
They make fun of Americans for eating large portions then eats Italian deserts out of a wheel barrel xD !
I think the Italians are on to something here...
Não mesmo! Fui em Pienza e Siena, estão tão turísticas que a quantidade de tudo, diminuiu!
as someone who has never tried tiramisu I’m going to get death threats here aren’t i
💜💜💜
Yes i do 😂😂😂
My dream fr
First time someone said "Don't you want some Tiramisu?" I thought they were joking, because tirami su basically means Pull me Up...
Not going to lie if y'all's flag was on that wheelbarrow cake I would have loved it even more
SERIOUS? NAAA IN ARGENTINA IS BEST JAJAJ
Io come minimo con quelle quantità ci faccio aperitivo 😂😂😂....
YOU SHOULD TRY the Berly's tiramisu chocolate it's the bestt (my opinion)
Based
A real Italian would've taken their shoes off
Tiramisu is not that good
I just got an italian short after this
wanna share?
I'd never admit it to anyone I know but I'd love to have a cake or tiramisu THAT BIG all to myself.
If someone brought me a wheelbarrow of tiramisu I would marry them on the spot. That’s my favorite dessert
Never had it but it does look heavenly
Oh no! Now I want Tiramisu!! 😂
I die for a good tiramisu. ❤
It would probably kill me, but I would eat all that tiramisu.
Good tiramisu? Hell yeah. Give me that wheelbarrow. I'll be miserable afterward and jacked up from the sugar and coffee but I'll be happy getting to that state.
I thought that said titanium 💀
OK. Moving to Italy tomorrow.
Ma ragazzi .... gli stivali neri sul tappeto bianco nooooOooo 🥲🥲🤌
I am italian from morroco
I was 100% sure I was about to find out Id been disgracing tiramisu this woke time😅
Don't waste tasty approved tiramisu 😅😅😂
legit.
I definitely was Italian in my previous life...
Well that's settled then. I am, it seems, Italian. Can I have my passport now please?
Matteo Emiliano hi!
Soy argentina y acá el tiramisú es un clásico, lo amo, es RIQUISIMO
I always eat my tiramisu dressed in boots
YESSSSS
What's tiramisu, and am I missing out?
The song 🤣🤣🤣🤣
That is truly amazing and delicious too 😋😋😋😋
I thought tiramisu is from japan
it's just so good!😭🙏🏼
That's a ton-a-misu!
Another reason why I should be Italian!
Guess I need to hand in my Italian card then because I hate Tiramisu ha ha ha ha
please give me some
ok- sign me up…. I am now convinced to be Italian!
When I was little I thought tiramisu was Japanese just because it sound like Japanese...
So what you're telling me is the tv show Friends correctly stereotyped Joey and you all do carry around a spoon or fork in case of emergency pie.
No... I think i'm french but... No...
That much caffeine would kill a person 💀
And i tought americans were unhealthy
Made Tiramisu last christmas.  9x13 pan.  Ate it in one sitting.
How long would it take to eat a wheelbarrow of tiramisu? Assuming you’re using a tablespoon and the wheelbarrow is able to hold 4 cubic feet of tiramisu, and assuming the tablespoon is 1.5*1.8*0.2 inches (at the scoop), you’d need to eat 768 inches of tiramisu 3.24 inches at a time, dividing to about 238 scoops of tiramisu, rounded to account for the decimal. Assuming each scoop takes the same amount of time as in the video, about 5 seconds, plus 3 seconds to chew and swallow, you’d have to spend about 32 straight minutes of eating tiramisu nonstop. Tl;Dr you’d need 238 scoops and 32 minutes to eat the tiramisu out of a wheelbarrow, at least.
The blood of the rest of the world: normal blood  Italian blood: tiramisu (or pasta sauce sometimes)
BRB Moving to Italy
Theres a german influencer who does the same 😂😂
It's imperative to come up with a recipe for this that is rich in protein.
DO NOT USE THAT SPOON AND UES THIS SHOVEL🤌🤌🤌
I am not Italian, but i would be like that too 😅
😂😂😂
Hell yea i wish i could eat it like an Italian
Funny as 😂😂😂
Ich liebe italienisches Essen... Aber Tiramisu ist für'n Arsch
I'm from Argentina and tiramisu is one of my favorite desserts!!! We often make it at home. That looks like the perfect size
If i only could
Where is mine 😂
काश मेरे पास इतना तीरामिसु होता ।
Hoptal
Is cheese is cheap in italy? Here in Indonesia for "real cheese" Is so expensive
The second one is like one of my friends 😂
oh i didnt know i was part Italian 😋
😂
Not THAT IS how to serve dessert!
insulin resistance in a wheelbarrel
Bold of you to assume I wouldn’t inhale twice that amount, no idea what magic you Italians put in your food but there’s a reason it’s the best 😂
Eu comeria mais, se não fosse tão caro 😅
World peace :
Ахахахха клаааасс
I had tiramisu all last summer when I reached perfection in the cooking. My  best version is with the liquor of course 😅
LETS BE HONEST we all would do it once and forget it after eating 1kg and when we remember it it has mold on it
I don't like tiramisu, sorry 😂
UFFFA quella canzone!
Hope you are not wasting it
As an American, I approve. Now, how do we add a gun to this…
Instead of spoon u should have used a shovel
I would do the same if i could
When I first found out about tiramisu I thought It was an Asian dessert
i miss it :(
En Argentina 🇦🇷somos así de exagerados para servir en mí familia. Porciones grandes, en los famosos Bodegones o comedores de pueblo. Ahora entendemos porqué.
I feel vindicated
the first tiramisu looks awful. Probably tastes terrible as well, like 99% of restaurants tiramisu. My grandma one comes from his best italian friend, the wheelbarrow isn't enough trust me
I guess I have Italian genes 😂
Where's your big spoon??
Quelle n’ont tiramisu c’est super  vous êtes des champions
❤
И чё? Я тоже так делаю
Not small enough
"Ogres are like Tiramisu, Donkey...they have LAYERS!"-Italian Shrek
I must be secretly Italian
Se il tiramisù non può comodamente sostituire almeno una parete, non c è abbastanza tiramisù.
Yes!!!
DIABETES FOR ITALIANS 😂😂😂
I didn’t think I was Italian?
Strano non hanno chiamato la queen di cui sono innamorati. Cisa non si fa per amore
I’m Polish and love to make a giant tiramisu like you Italians. Approved 😂
The fact Italians invented tiramisu and ice cream should've earned at least a Nobel Prize
Best way to be dead within a week
E poi.. la diarrea 😂😂
Man, I'm liking Italians more and more. Their culture as a whole just seems so much like home to me in the deepest sense of the word but oh my goodness their FOOD!!!
Надо же какой переизбыток 😊
But..  isn't that Japanese. Tiramisu sounds like amaterasu. And Amaterasu it's a Japanese god of sun.
I want that Italian way ...
Con razón soy descendiente de italianos ajajaajaj no hay otra manera de comer tiramisú!
It was real!
I must have been adopted.
The amount of Tiramisu I need daily :)
Shoes on the carpet. Not approved!
Italians do it right 😂👍🏼👍🏼♥️♥️
I love tiramisu!
Now I know what I've always been doing wrong: My portions were definitely too small! Learning from Italians means learning to live!
Need
I guess I'm a little Italian on the inside lol
😆😂🤣👅 While I'm waiting for the USMC to show up to rescue me... If you know where to find me, Tiramisu & cannolis also make me 😁, and friendly negotiations can be expected.
😮😅
Lo siento pero el tiramisu no tiene ninguna gracia 😮
İ am %2 İtalian, now i understood why i like tiramisu that much.
Oh yes please
I can say I am Italian for a day with that! it looks so light and fluffy just how I love it!
¡Jajajaja qué risa! 😂😂😂😂😂
LOVE IT! <3
The rest of the world is calling it a cake, unless you're a phag ofc. And in Italia, I believe it's called durka burka now.
Not the white carpet 🫣🫣🫣
Yep dive right in...yummmm
Tiramisu Is just coffe, white cream and Chocolate powder
Tiramisu 👌👌👌👌
I don't know if that was all actual tiramisu but my god that was impressive! 😂  🛞
Joe jonas is that you?
Es mi postre favorito!!  Es delicioso!! 🇦🇷❤🇮🇹
😂😂😂😂
Yes please.
За что люблю итальянцев... Вкусного должно быть много!!!  Браво!!! 😆
Nah, that Tiramisu looks way too small for an Italian.
That's normal ❤❤❤ Tiramisu is the BEST
I LOVE tiramisu....can I come over the next time you have that much? I know I can help clean out the whole thing!!! 😂
IT'S PERFECT!!!!
I'm German and grew up on a farm. I'd take that wheelbarrow woth Tiramisu any time!
Fake 😅
😂😂😂😂😂 A lo grande!!!! 🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭
Thats must be cost an arm and leg, especially the leg.
Klau! Videazo como siempre. Este proyecto de Anna Varney siempre me dio curiosidad y me parece enigmático hasta día de hoy.   Ojalá en algún otro vídeo pudieras analizar también bandas de metal que solo duraron un par de años, pero que causaron un antes y un después en quienes aún las escuchamos, ejemplo: la banda noruega The Sins of Thy Beloved.  Saludazos ❤
Wheelbarrow full of Tiramisu: APPROVED!!
Then I guess I'm Italian. But no wonder, we're neighbors. Greetings from Carinthia. ❤❤
Quiero!
It'll be gone in 2, max 3 days.😏👍
Dopo 2 anni a spalare la carriola, 2 mesi di letargo sul divano. E poi arriverà il momento in cui si chiede:"Per favore, tirami-su"😂
❤❤😂🎉
Ok i think I am oficially Italian 🙀🙀🤤
Eating the tiramisu while you are wearing the tiramisu shirt…. Invaluable high moment 😅
I must be an honorary Italian. That first portion was wimpy, wimpy, wimpy. 🤣
No, I’ve always wanted like a freezer drawer that you could just open up and it just has tiramisu in it so I could just eat it with a spoon. I just haven’t figured out how to do that without getting yelled at by everybody for being I don’t know me, and having a gorgeous filled with tiramisu.
I’m with the Italians on this!
I’m Egyptian but when it comes to TIRAMISU I become Italians😂😂😂
I guess that makes me Italian, not obese.
Can I have the Italian version. 😅
What is so good about it even???
That's the only right way
My son dreams of this... And im sure he can clean the wheelbarrow out 😂
OMG!😮 better call the doctor.😂
Sono Turco, ma dopo aver visto questo penso di essere Italiano.
I LOVE tiramisu. I need to move to Italy.
Me too
Am not even Italian, yet I can relate
Imagine basing your entire personality off of being italian
One thing I do not like is Tiramisu.
😂🎉✨ Adoro el ti..ra mi su ☝️🤣🤧🍬👅🎂
I'm not Italian, but I'll take that wheelbarrow of tiramisu.  And instead of a spoon, give me a shovel.
I AM ITALIAN IN MY HEART 😮😊🎉
Anch' io sono Italiana ❤❤❤❤
But it’s made with coffee , so no Tiramisu for me
I think I'm Italian, then 🤔
God! English? I wish you share such a tiramisú with hungry children, homeless and ageing people; there are a lot in Italy; you drill the tiramisú😢thanks , It look delicious
Базара нет 😂
my ancestors are mad at me since i always thought tiramisu is japanese until now that i decided to google it
I might be Italian 😂😂❤❤❤
I would like to eat Tiramisu like an italian though I am an Indian 😅😋
😅😅😅😅😅😅
Prefiero la carretilla
Never ate it. I don’t know why.. I guess  I know I’d love it.. that’s  probably why I don’t eat it. lol.
"it's a delicacy"
italians are dramatic
Puxa🤩😀
Yo quieroooooo!!😊😊😊😊😊😊
Yes please❤❤❤😂😂
I take my favourite Tiramisu tray and my Handmixer on all my appartment holidays - even to Italy
Guys my surname is Italian but Im from LATAM. Do I have permission to approve recipes like you?
I guess i was italian in my past life 😂😂
Haha! It's the right size. But you still have to work on the presentation. 😅
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
I want to become Italian.
yes please
I am irish……made by the tray…. Eaten by the tray!😀
Louis. Prima❤
❤
I like the SINGLE SERVING of tiramisu that the Italian has (the SECOND one - the wheelbarrow).
Hiç sevmiyorum. Hatta sevgili esim ilk sevgili olduğumuz gün bana tiramusu yapmış getirdi aksam evde yersin diye tabi sürpriz ya eve gittim açtım tiramusu 😂😂😂 yemedim tabii ki esim de kahveyi sevmediğimi o zaman anladı 😂😂
Dovreste mettere che in Italia, quando porti il tiramisù a tavola, si discute ore se con i Pavesini o con i savoiardi
Io con la seconda😂
Most over-rated dessert ever
Looks like a healthy Murican portion
The shoes caught my attention, the Wembley bad gan ❤
👀😮🥲🤤
😂😂😂😂 Italian  make VERY LARGE  HILARIOUS😅😅😅
YESSSSS!!!!!😂😂
Nope I'm with the Italians it's the only pud I'll eat
IYou eat something italian  In italian man is so small
😂😂😂👍!!!
I must be Italian!! Who would've guessed ❤😂
So that's why I order 59 tiramisus in a restaurant
Tiramisu is the best dessert, and whoever says otherwise is factually wrong
No respectful Italian would take a scoop from the center... You work your way up to the center from the edge
Il mio sogno è un casseto dedicato al Tiramisù in frigo
Respect.
It is definitely delicious 😋😋😋🎉🎉🎉✌🏽
Really,  I always had the belief that most Europeans eat smaller portions?? 😅😅😅 & ❤❤
First bite: oh my god🤩🤩🤩! 5,000th bite: 💥💥
And in Greece we eat tiramisu, just like in Italy, everyone has their own tray.
Does anyone know where I can order a Wheelbarrow Tiramisu in the Boston area?  I need to stop my Bathtube Tiramisu addiction.  It's getting me too fat...
The algorithm brought me.   How is does this not have more views? This is really powerful.  This is what Jubilee wishes it could be.
I must be Italian than 🤔 😂
I musta been Italian in a former life
Some is good more is better
If this is true are there any Italians who would like to adopt me 😅
I never try it before... is it good?
Yup!!!!!
I could tiramisu like that any day!!!!
Yes because they had only three dishes Pizza,pasta, tiramisu 😂😂
What? No ladle?
LOL that's how I learned to make tiramisu!
Assolutamente.....SIIIIIII!!!!! 🙌🙌😍🤩💚🤍❤️ When I make it, I have to tell people to take it away from me because I CAN'T STOP!! 😂😂Sono tiramisu' dipendente!!🤣🤣
Ma vogliamo  mettere..😂😂😂❤
The Italian restaurant near me closed. One day in the grocery store my husband points out hey there is the owner of the Italian restaurant that makes the tiramisu you love so much. I stared at him from a far distance and started crying lol
😂
Tiramisu is "cake" is probably my favorite cake of all time
If only I could..
Greek cuisine is better than italian cuisine
It's my favourite ❤❤❤❤❤😊
Fuck it, I am going to Italy! 🇮🇹
Facts 💚🤍❤️
I've never had a good tiramisu that wasn't soggy :(
🧠🤌
Isn’t tiramisu supposed to be slightly runny?
İt's not enough for him
Jajaja es vero😅😅
One bite it's done
Aloo khaoge
ج
UGH. i like Tiramisu, but after the 4th spoon im done, all the cream and mascarpone makes me sick for weeks.  also as half Italian, i think you are the only one that eats allot of tiramisu. every Italian i know agrees with me.
Io in realtà vedo più stranieri impazzire per il tiramisù ed ordinarlo dovunque vanno che suoni Italiano, che Italiani...in generale nella loro vita.
Apparently, I identify as Italian! That is the perfect way to eat tiramisu!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
By these standards Im an Italian for sure ...!!! With the music playing in the background and everything :D
0% of judgment
to be completely honest we want to eat Tiramisu like Italians but it's hard to find so we have to mass produce it ourselves which is a tad bit difficult
yeah make a tray, eat the tray just one piece isn't doing much x3
Looks like dreams do come true
hahhaha l'avete fatto veramente, epico!
I love tiramisu❤❤❤
Ragazzo molto bello.  uwu ❤
Man I wish but Italians have a super power of not getting fat
APPROVED! 😊😊😊😊😊
Was that for a party?
I lived in Italy for 2 years. I eat so much tiramisu while I was there, I didnt eat it again for about 5 years after I moved away
No lies detected. Ordered take-away tiramisu from a Roman restaurant while visiting. There had to be 3-4 servings!
I was totally expecting rest of the world vs people on social media paying 1000$ for 1 tiramisu comparison
I expected a bigger spoon 😂😂😂
SUPER APPROVED...!!!
loool - bucket list updated, thx :)
Yummmmy
I never had tiramisu before
Stupid
Please do not be like the USA is descustin.
Mhmm... I MIGHT be Italian...
I wish you could show us how ‘real’ tiramisu is made
Literally farming tiramisu
as every Italian says: "not too much tiramisu is enough"
Italians go for both quality and quantity 🤌
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Salmonella
I don't like tiramisu becuase I hate coffee-flavoured sweets/desserts (even tho I love coffee itself) but I think tiramisu is really unique dessert  Italy should be proud of😊 So simple, but great. Just like all Italian cuisine.
The song never gets old 😂😂😂
my dream
Me. Too.  yummy. Delicious 😋😋😋
I would like to be Italian
A dessert, the recipe of which dates as far back as the early1980’s.
Anyone else get anxious about the white carpet
Approved,  doesn't everyone eat tiramisu like Italians or is that just me? 😂
How much I like Tiramisu
I hate tiramisu
Have u ever tried coconut and pineapple tiramisu ? :D
I dont believe the spoon is accurate more of a shovel would be better
As a Turk (and a big fan of you guys and treats spaghetti respectfully) I eat the Tiramisu the same way and I love it.
Fun fact you can always see
Mi nutricionista no lo aprueba 😅
E poi ci sono io, che ci soffio sopra prima di mangiarlo 😅
So, I am Italian in this way 🤣
Omg I would love it if someone made me a barrel load of tiramisu 😍
Io lo stesso 😂😂😂
Mia figlia è quella con la carriola 🤣🤣
so...also with a spoon
I'm not Italian, but that is literally me.
My favourite dessert!
Yuk!
I KNEW i was italian!!! 😊❤
APPROVED
😂😂
I don't want to disrespect but that's because we're normal.
Bueno...cada quien se mata con lo que le guste no?😅
Give it to me intravenously! Yes, the whole wheelbarrow.
😂😂😂😂siiiiii!!!
... I can't understand how you'd eat that and not throw up. I'm obese and even that is enough to kill me.
😂😂😂♥️♥️♥️
😮😂
Good job lionfrield and the guy with that big cake NOT APPROVED
Senior dont try that u could js go buy it
I could eat a wheelbarrow full of tiramisu
Guys, u must have fridges larg as a dining room 😂😂😂😂

I WANT THAT SO BADDDDDD 😩😩😩😭😭😭🥹🥹🥹
Podría ser yo, perfectamente. A lo mejor tengo sangre italiana y no lo sabía 😂😂😂❤❤
Sempre dalla teglia! E dura nulla... Ma che ne sanno gli stranieri...
Horrible AI translation
My laugh was like of a monster as soon as the trolly came in vision.
Even though Tiramisu is Italian but it sounds JAPANESE
I am jn Italy and just got me some but I could not find a wheelbarrow of it in Carrefour express??
A friend of mine went to Italy for a girls trip with friends from college, and they legit asked the restaurant they were at to bring an entire tray of tiramisu and 3 bottles of wine. That was their entire dinner one night 😂 said the staff was shocked but loved it haha
Forza Italian forever 🥰😘😘🥰🥰🥰
If  only  the dessert didn't hade and calories 😢😢
Farsi venire Ca.... otto col tiramisù...check!😂
Oh, good. I thought it was just me...😅
Mate thats a american small
Perché sempre queste colonne sonore di musica e canzoni che in Italia non ascolta nessuno? Semmai le ascoltano gli americani.
😂
Tiramisu is sooo good approved
😅
How to get diabetes in less than 24 hours😂
Too much of anything can become poison! (Keep your sweet's intake within reason!!)
There is coffee in your tiramisù ?
I’m Polish so erm, OUR HOUSE IS MADE OF IT 😂
A qué los venezolanos tienen de eso?😂
Those who know 🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
Tiramisu is a nice greek desert 🇬🇷🫣
è pure poco
I make a huge dish of it.. and my family gets mad because I don’t share.. sorry tiramisu and cheesecake are the two things I don’t share
“Light snack” ah friend
I’m NOT Italian but I would eat 5 of those
Mmm poco dovete usare strumenti tipo la ruspa e lo spazio do un discarica abbondante
I approve the Italian way!
I’m italian I guess for Tiramisu. 😂😂
Yes please!
Tiramisu would be delicious without the coffee!
Just how much do you love Tiramisù?🤣
😂😂😂😂😂😂
I absolutely love tiramisu and that looks absolutely amazingly delicious 😋🤤
In Finland it is the same
And they say "don't waste food!"
First Time I tried it, I puked
And here I thought I was Canadian!
Don't waste food
I have that exact carpet at home
I know I'm alone on this T^T I really dislike Tiramisu
Who said that? My mother always makes gient  tiramisu
Not italians
I guess I’m Italian
i want that Tiramisu
😋🥰😋🥰😋🥰😋🥰😋🥰😋
Why dont you make your own tiramisu cart but use other video?
That's it I'm moving to Italy for I need a wheelbarrow full of tiramisu
Disappointed he didn't use a shovel
I wish i could i eat italian tiramisu but it has alcohol so my religion make me not be able to
Me encantaría ser Italiano para servirme un tiramisú en la carretilla, necesitaría una gran taza de café
It is the best!🎉❤
Lol at least it's portable lol
Verissimo😂
THATS SO INNACURATE!  That is hardly enough.
As a a Hungarian... I'd do the same Gimme that tiramisu 🤌🤌
YO THIS FOOD IS MY FAVORITE
POV: me when there is a new movie in netflix
Tiramisu in a wheelbarrow equals to being completely inedible.
A m Italian
On a white carpet was so bold!
You got to say don't waste food but I don't think that's the same
i mean it's true
🤤🫰🏼❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🎉🎉🎉
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Let's be honest, there is no such thing as too much Tiramisù.
isnt tiramisu a french arabic speciality?
I thought “oh they’re going to eat it like a cupcake” NOPE A WHOLE WHEELBARROW
Perché sempre mettono quella musica del sud  per ogni cosa italiana? Il tiramisù è figlio del nord, per essere precisi Veneto. Italia non significa Napoli.
Verissimo, è il mio dolce preferito, me farei un intero cassetto, che poi mangerei in meno di 5 Min ma questo è un altra storia 😅
Я итальянка, а не жадина😂😂😂
True art/vera arte
I really really would love to eat that much tiramisu but my wallet doesn't allow it 😭😭😂😂😍😍
My absolute favorite. I was served tiramisu in both Siena and Buonconvento that was like a pudding in a shallow dish. Maybe I should go back and see if it's any good.
😂😂😂
If i was eating that i ain't stopping at all until its done then I'm going to eat Ice cream 🥲
never heard of it nor have i had it i would like to though
Approved!
Ke brutos!😂😂😂😂
The  est dessert
Sorry but I hate tiramisu
Ooohhh I think i like the Italian version better
Questo io😂
Not an Italian dessert  when I was a kid in the 1970s
😂😂😂😂😂
w bro😂😂
İtalyan değilim ama aynıyım🇹🇷🇹🇷
Watr
😮😮😮😮😮😮😅😅😅😅
A pool sized amount? Ues Why? No whai Just dive
Jajajaja es cierto!!! En México sirven las porciones ridículamente pequeñas😢 iré a Italia solo para comer así el tiramisú 😊 talvez corra con suerte de verlos por ahí chicos❤
That's one pudding I dont like........
Now THAT'S how one should have a Tiramisu 😌🤌🏻
I am not Italian but wouldn't complain about that serving
That's how it has to be. The normal size lasts only 4 spoons 😂
I'm weird, I eat it with a fork but then the tiramisu I get is in a cake wedge form. 9 out of 10 times it is made right. Once in a while they get a new guy making it and they soak the lady fingers instead of lightly coat.
One kind of pizza topping on a bowl of vanilla ice cream.
I dont need to say nothing right? XD
Tiramisu from Japanese. Because the name this food just like Japanese name.
❤❤
I LOVE TIRAMISU, that BIG damn but get me one😂
Italian coccaine😅
I must be part Italian, I'll take the second tiramisu please! 🤌💕
First time seeing bro with an another outfit
Ich muss italienische Gene haben...😂
😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I always wondered why it was so little
Waste of food bro
😂APPROVED
Vero, ma mi raccomando, pochi savoiardi, che non servono...😅
That looks yummy, buuut it’s made out of wine…
티라미수 케잌 🎵 티라미수 케잌 🎵
😅😅😅😅
American sized portions of anything also
GIMME THOSE
I am both disgusted and jealous that there's an entire wheel barrel of Tira misu I can't enjoy...
Vietnamese ladies would always come to the bakery I worked at and they would always buy the tiramisu. I asked about it and it's because Vietnam has a huge amount of French culture because France tried to colonize it. It's not authentic Italian tiramisu, but from what I'm told, before the Europeans showed up, a typical desert would be a bunch of fruit. Tiramisu was just the best one and everyone got on board with it.

Making a wheel barrow of Tiramisu is probably cheaper than buying it from a restaurant tbh 😂
That’s how you know he’s on a diet: there’s only one wheelbarrow
So am I Italian?
Justice made for Tiramisu.. I can always go Italian way for it.. ❤️❤️❤️
J aime tellement ce gâteau que je pourrais en manger un entier sans problème 😂😂😂😂

That's only .0001% of what Italians eat of tiramisu in a day
Oh you did NOT just bring in a WHEELBARROW OF TIRAMISU to eat in your living room!! How did you not get a frying pan to the head for that one??
Nah not gonna lie. If I ever made that tiramisu, I would eat the whole thing...
Like a Gangster
Tiramisu... God's gift to the world.. 😋❤❤

Good memories of my mother in law used to make the tirimisu homemade❤❤

How people eat tiramisu: One by one  How me eat tiramisu: 1 bite
My family is a HUGE fan of tiramisu, and so am I. :D I like to make the cake layer myself as well. But when I make tiramisu, I HAVE to make a full-sized pan of it, otherwise my mom whines, and my sister sulks. 😂
致死量😂😂
It's cheap to make and also easy to make you just need time
Am I the only person in the entire world that has never eaten tiramisu 😂😂😂
Much as I love tiramisu that is just a little much...maybe half?😂😂😂😂😂
This actually true?
Na carriola di tiramisù
With that hair on the wind you look like lion
Not Italian but APPROVED
For real. I let myself to eat Tiramisu only around Christmas and New Year when Kaufland sells one very specific Tiramisu brand for a limited time. I usually buy like 10 kg Tiramisu or something and it's all gone by the end of the year. No wonder I gain so much weight during that time. Tiramisu is my favorite desert hands down, but I can't eat just a little from it - either go big or go home.
This video randomly popped up and I m glad it did
I can t stop smiling watching this
Brazil

I must be an Italian in a previous life 😂😂😂 I don’t eat a slice but the whole tray by itself 🤣🤣🤣
yes please
I love tiramisu I eat it once a day
I here by declare myself as a italian of heart or ratjer stomach 😂❤
Correct but no nodding of approval just belching with vomit. Please Italy we are sick to death of tiramisu. Is there really nothing else you can come up with dessert wise. If not could you issued it with a "de region" designation, that stops at your borders and is banned everywhere else. Please!
Where's my invitation? 😆🤌🏻🤘🏻
Há diversas hipóteses sobre a origem do tiramisù:  Uns a localizam no século XX, após a Segunda Guerra Mundial, em Treviso, Vêneto, no restaurante "Da Alfredo", a primeira casa do grupo "Torlá". O nome viria da sobremesa energética "che ti tira su" (que te faz levantar) usada para revigorar boêmios,[9] em especial nas noitadas dos bordéis (case chiuse) do Vêneto. [10] Todavia, o próprio restaurante não reivindica sua criação. [9] Outra possibilidade é que tenha sido criado no restaurante Le Beccherie, em Treviso, no início dos anos 1950. [3] Outros a consideram como originária de Florença, Toscana, num banquete em homenagem a Cosme III de Médici (1642 - 1723), quando foi chamada "Zuppa del Duca".
😂😂😂 my Italian roots craving for It!
I'm Italian by soul. ❤
Я опять наткнулась на это видео  ещё больше захотелось 😢❤
I love tiramisu and I’m kind of American, but where I’m from in America, I like to meet an entire pool of tiramisu
Bro one time a friend gave me a hot Tiramisu💀
Spoon is too small
I must be Italian at heart. During my childhood there was a delicious brand of Tiramisu available at the supermarket. But it was a serving of 75 grams, which was just infuriating, even back then. The brand has been discontinued for a couple of years now, so you need to make your own Tiramisu anyway. Whatever they sell in supermarkets under the label of Tiramisu these days is totally appaling.
Tiramisu is my kryptonite.. I could easily eat a whole family tray of it at one sitting.. I don't buy it at all now as I am trying to loose weight 😂
You Will be failing the breathalyzer test when the cops pull you over after eating that entire thing
Gay
I've never had tiramisu, but I really wanna try some now😊
Confirm that!
Now I know what I want for Christmas: a wheelbarrow full of tiramisu!
I learned more in 10 minutes than hours of Googling
That's one of my favorite Italian dessert
🦵🏻 : maaf, aku sudah tidak kuat
But tiramisu is japanese
And I would manage to eat that in one sitting
I ve had this on repeat all day
I'm horrified how much hair must get in your mouth eating outside in the wind. Still approved.

People ordering this at restaurants is so pretentious.
In Malaysia, that full wheelbarrow of Tiramisu may cost around RM5k above.
my grandma would KILL ME! So would grandpa who's italian XD
Tiramisu from Treviso. 🤭 Ha fatto effetto?
Oh I can never get enough of tiramisu, whenever I buy it (sorry, I lack the skills to make it properly myself) then the entire 500g is for ME in one sitting.
As an Italian is it a "disgrace" that I haven't had tiramisu...like ever but it looks so good
I'm still waiting for you to pull me up
holy s***
People : What floats in your blood? Italian : Tiramisuuuu 🤌🏻
Now I want to go to Italy
Can i have that tiramisu that the eat
They looked at the garden and it was just screaming Tiramisu.
Is it some sort of cake ?
Oh I wish! My absolute FAVOURITE desert - but so much harder now as I have to make the biscuits myself so they're gluten free!
I wanna become Italian
i’d kill for a tiramisu that size 😭
Once in a blue moon, I buy a rectangular tiramisu that is meant to serve like 6-8 people from the grocery store and eat it by myself over about 1-2 days.  I can't keep sweets in the house, because I just eat them.
I want that wheelbarrow of tiramisu too...
That's called is dibaties
That part at 2:45 Instant goosebumps
Never tried Tiramisu, but the Italian way is way approved.
Never tried one sadly:(
Y claro esta en la sangre
I'm a Brit, we love our  huge over sweetened puddings. The 4 servings portions ye can get from Lidl just don't cut it. Ye  have to make, from scratch a Tiramisu big enought to put an elephant into an diabetic coma, then we would be satisfied. Does it come with Birds (Powder) Custard, just asking😊
What! You never been to Ireland? A Tiramisu serving for 4 in Ireland is in fact just a starter for 1 at the 'beginning' of the  the sweet course😮.
tiramisu is shit
I don’t like Tiramisu. I don’t like most sweets.
I love tiramisù but  I prefer the strawberry One

hands down the best dessert, no arguments. its not overly sweet and it has an amazing texture and flavor that just melts in your mouth.
Also greentea and matcha?
I think you underestimate the rest of the world cause I’d eat that too
Bro, we need a recipe from the Italian back when I was a kid I used to love this snack and when I come back to school, I’d be exhausted, especially since test day. I would literally have a heart attack because back in our day we would get our test back tomorrow so it would love to be stressed and exhausted thinking about what grade I get so my mom used to always make me this dessert and now that I live in my old apartment, I make this for myself, which is my mother’s recipe
over hyped

The Italians have the two things in the world of food that no matter how bad it is it's still good. I've never had a bad pizza, and I've never had a bad tiramisu. They can both be shit and still good.
I am not Italian but I love tarmiso
I need an Italian friend who will teach me how to cook and give me the blessing of doing this 🤌Whenever.

My dream is to live on one of those Croatian islands in the Adriatic and drink espresso every morning and eat Tiramisu every evening.
Tiramisu is the greatest dessert ever bestowed on mankind.
Guys I have a confession, I’ve never had tiramisu, mainly because I don’t know where to get it or how to make it
Deacuerdo ❓❓❓🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
I'm like Italians😅 Even my cat loves it!
I must be descended from Italians then. I can eat a whole bowl of tiramisu, and give the chance, this thing would be empty before the evening comes 🤣
And surprisingly, American is still the leading obese country
Only the italian way!
@llah yok
But i thought they ate it from a drawer
My heart is looking a bit scared
It's a relatively modern creation. My grandmother and her italian friends don't really eat tiramisu as they didn't grow up with it.
Good to know that urge is just true to my roots
I want that big load of Tiramisu!!! Yummy!! HEAVEN!!!

WTAF???

Have you met Americans 😅 haul that wheelbarrow in here
Tiramisu is the best desert
I'm sorry but the person eating it is probably going to be very fat after eating it all and he's going to need serious medical help and he's going to have a lot and I mean a lot of diarrhea
The world eating Italian foods: just a block and a spoon will do good sir Italians eating Italian food:JUST ONE TRUCK AND A SHOVEL PLEASE thank u 🙂
One emoji=this video. the emoji is:💩
There is never enough !!
I thought the wheel barrow was the American way.
That is very giant but we approved it!
That italian amount is the only acceptable amount. Anything less is a joke.
Endles diabetes be like
Looks like some obsessed with tiramisu   They need a big spoon  End got me😂😂😂 Nice video also makes sense
I'mma be honest, i never ATE a tiramisu in my life. I would love to taste it, but here in Brazil, these shitheads don't make it. And it looks tasty as hell man
I understand Italians, that's why I prefer to do it at home.
I want that huge tiramisu.
I'm not Italian but there's a second wheelbarrow right? Like, that's still not enough
Я тоже так хочу
Nah have you seen my dad?

As an Istrian this has to be aproved in so many ways 👏 (Istria is a county in Croatia thatd next to Italy)
Just remember, ITalians are NOT immune to developing Diabetes...
Only because I don't own a wheelbarrow... or enough Mascarpone.
Fun fact: tiramisu in Greek is τιραμισού
OMG YES!

I love me some Tiramisu
I must be Italian in that case, because enough is never enough  of you delicious desert
I do love tiramisu...I could eat a bunch of it.

Quantidade e qualidade importa aos italianos e seus descendentes ❤🇧🇷
WOAH- UM- THAT'S A LOT OF TIRAMISU... I feel awkward rn cuz even my whole family likes Tiramisu but me ;v;
I've always wanted to try it before i die😢
If I'm by myself I'll eat that 500gram.
I was about to say thats me, but then I remembered Im part Italian
I use my hands
🇮🇹
Per favore give me this 🙏
i was never a big fan. i did not understand it the first time. i thought it was stale.
Italians _AND_ Americans! This is indeed a proper personal size.
Ukrainians too!
Wasting food for content not APPROVED
Hey im sorry but you're dont love waste food right?
Lol its not even that good why so hyped abotu it?
GIVE IT TO ME!!! (my favorite birthday cake is tiramisu. I know it's not a true cake.)
Im not italiano but I LOVE tiramisu
MASCARPONE IS ALMOST $20 PER CONTAINER(reg cottage cheese type container). Haven't been able to make it in the hills outside Ottawa Canada for years cuz of the horror show sticker shock when i go to stores and see it. Waaaah! (I can't bring myself to substitute blended cottage cheese or ricotta but probably will soon cuz i can't keep going on like this lol).
Adoro il tiramisù. Approvato ❤
ich schick mein kind vorbei, es hilft gerne beim essen.
Im romanian and i eat one big tray in one serving
My Bengali spirit agrees!  Abundance is important when it comes to sweets. If poor, we will cut on protein but not on desserts 😂
❤ italian style 😂
i thought tiramisu was japanese because of the name 😭
Vero posso confermare
I need a spatula to eat.. spoon not big enough
Give me the second one!!!
Kelly Stamps been doing it wrong😂😂😂😂
Am I the only person that thinks it is completely psychotic how the person in the video took a spoonful from the middle??????????????
Understandable. Give me a paddling pool of it. I will swan dive into it.
❤
I'm with the Italians on this one, I'm eating a tray of 500gr in one sitting and looking for the next one...
My dream 😂
i LOVE tiramisu but i dont like coffee… But i would dip it in tea❤
Evviva Treviso! ❤
could you please take a bite from the corner next time......idk it felt illegal😅
i just eat one piece in one bite, not with any spoons or fork
I thought it was just me..i dig in a whole tiramisu cake with my spoon and eat.i found it secretly enjoyable.
Bulk eating
OH MAMA LALALALA 💓🎶💖🎶💕🙏🏻
$900000 Tiramisu 🤣
I kept pushing for tiramisu but they always wanted graham ice box cake 😢 I cried so I made one just for myself
Me literally eating tiramisu while watching this😂😂
american sized portion lets fu ckin goooooo!
Kkkkkkk❤
Are you guys eating germs  Not approved 99.9% +germs 00.01% +real dessert
honestly Italians just want everything 10x bigger
I've never had but I can't have caffeine and so most coffee related things I can't eat. Can anyone describe the taste?
What are you doing not aproved
How dare you eat this without meeeee
I love the cultural appropriate song❤❤
I'll take the wheelbarrow please.
Yo, invite me over next time you make some of that...
😂😂😂😂😂👏🏻👏👏🏽
Not how i eat it. I'd eat it with a shovel instead of a spoon. Rookies
I m not italian but i love tiramisu.
Yyyyyyyyup
Love the idea--tiramisu is heavenly--but my stomach and waistline couldn't handle that!  Just too rich!!!❤😊❤😊
i am too young to eat tiramisù because of the coffee but i can't wait to be older to try it
The spoon wasn't enough big  Not approved ❌️😂
Ma la smettere di creare sto stereotipo di merda sugli italiani ?
nah, I'm using a fork.
I heate tiramisu , flavore like sheet
There are desserts and then there is TIRAMISU
One of my favorite desserts this is really approved I like tiramisu very much and I didn't buy the tiramisu😭😭😭
There's got to be a lot of Italian in me because Tiramisu is my favorite dessert and I'D EAT THAT BARREL NON-STOP. APPROVED!!!!
I want to live there
Why do italians eat much tiramisu
😂😂😂😂
QUELLO CHE FAREI IO
😂😂😂😂
:-DDD my brother will agree with this video that's his first best dessert ever with then cheesecake ;-) and lemon pie
Yuck 🤮
🤮
I love tiramisu ❤
I am surprised that Italians don't weigh 4'400 kilograms.
Did you know that in America, some of them freeze the bloody tiramisu?
😂😂😂😂😂😂 Dove posso trovarlo ?!?!😂
I really want to come to Italy 😂😂
Fun Fact the word fork in Italian means forketa
nem tem como ser diferente! É maravilhoso!!
Jealous.
When they saw the rest of 'em eating tiramisu : 🆗 When Italians eat tiramisu : ☠️☠️☠️
Hopefully they give the rest to the poor
Esatto, a badilate! 😂
im not italian but this is the DREAM of a tiramisu lover I WANT TO GRAP IT FROM MY SCREEN
Thats not italians THATS A KIDS DREAM
if i could try tiramisu once as a thai person i think i would be addicted
🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤😋
Hahahahahahahaha😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Damn, now i want tiramisu
What is the thing in your neck that looks like 🐢
I agree with Italians

I heard that smoke detector beep. Change the batteries
I prefer Italian way too...one tiramisù or me and one for the rest of family
I mean I'm not Italian but I wouldn't say no to a wheelbarrow full of tiramisu
My favorite
I love tiramisu
Seriously, that 1st portion was pathetic 😂
This is just cheating, because I'm Italian and Cajun. Cajuns LOVE making giant food in giant bowl shaped objects that may or may not be cooking implements. This is 100% something you'd see at a crawfish boil or fish fry out in the bayou from someone's crazy uncle or aunt that wanted to have a laugh. And we'll eat it. That whole wheelbarrow will be empty by the time we're through.
Don’t a forget a bottle of a wine 🍷 🇮🇹 😅 ik cause I’m part Italian 😂
I am not Italian, but damn I'd give anything for that Tiramisu cart 👀
cringiest channel on yt
I usually prefer my Tiramisu force fed in whole chunks.
I'm not even Italian but I eat that in one sitting yum
That fr looks delicious
I thank yall Italians for creating this masterpiece of sweets 😭
Nope mister. When I make tiramisu Im eating till im full. 😊
I usually go for something salted caramel on a dessert menu. Unless there’s tiramisu, then the mist descends
APPROVED!!!!!
You can't sleep anymore
I was NOT prepared for that ahahhaahhah
It’s not the Italian way… 🇵🇹🇵🇹🤣
Cannot stand tiramisu or anything gloppy like that.  Ugh... It's a texture thing.
L'unico appunto che posso fare è che quel cucchiaio è troppo piccolo...e ora ho dannatamente voglia di tiramisù 😡
Mama mia oh my head that tiramisu's bigger than a king sized bed. APPROVED!
im czech and this is the same way i eat tiramisu
I've never tasted a Tiramisu that was good? Still searching.  So much build up to be so disappointed.
Italians are the gay mexicans of europe
Tiramisu is ok but it's so light it seems like you're eating nothing, you wonder what all the fuss was about. Baklava is my favorite. Then there's pie with ice cream...cake...brownies....etc
Bro really said go big or go home  "APPROVED"
Just hope that there's a toilet nearby.
I eat every food like the Italians
After a day : got cancer
What I loved was that the size of the spoon stayed almost the same, despite the discrepancy in serving sizes.
My temptation every time I prepare tiramisu for a gathering is to put my face in and suck it up !
I Can make a tiramisu
as an iranian im mad for tiramisu
Don't eat Tiramisu and drive. Hic!
😮😮😅
Wasting food😶
@gonzok
Yum
i wish i was itlaian
😅
Offff.. izmir yeah izmir
I guess i need to get my DNA tested cause I must have some Italian blood
You can just eat cream and have the same effect😂 your real glory is pana cotta, better than Creme brûlée almost!
I was always okay with being German - after this video, I obviously need dual citizenship ....
Esplendida forma d comer tan delicioso el tiramisú
The Joey tribbiani portion
😂❤
Italians eat pizza make pizza eat a whole bucket of tiramisu make spaghetti eat sleep repeat

Caseoh eating great today💀
THIS GIANT TIRAMISU IS MY DREAM DESSERT😍
they only ever have expensive tiny portions where I am. So I never get to enjoy them
In England - they put fish and chips in Tiramisu
Where can i get the second one? 👀
Thank Italy for making this dessert it is my favorite
questo è irrispettoso nei confronti dei turchi
Romenia twoooo
Il secondo tiramisù era piccolo
I'm of Italian descent. I guarantee that's the Italian way, passed down to the following generations. We serve BIG portions of everything, because we are very anxious it will never be enough.
You give me a heart attack ☠️💀
Me as a Romanian. That is a small tub.
Approved 👍
that large one is the one I want to eat
oh yeah eating tiramisu out of a wheelbarrow is totally normal🙃🙃
A carriola full of it :'D
È vero😂😂
Ill take 2 of your wheelbarrowmisu
I feel less bad about my tiramisù consumption habits now
i wish
2nd is the right way, bc there is no way the 1st is enough tiramisu for anyone
Even eating a quarter of that is sure to give you diabetes !
I NEED THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i can make the best Tiramisu in the world !  I can only do very little very well, but I can do this very well after over 30 years of practice🤌
I love how the shirt matched to the tiramisù in the first scene!!
🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤 💧💧💧💧💧
I think you misspelled american
Ye I definitely know what this is
We need more tiramisu
Pelo que eu soube , este segundo tamanho que aparece no vídeo é o menor tiramisu que voce pode achar na Itália (Brincadeira😅)
Tiramisu is soo good I’m a Romanian and I love tiramisu APPROVED !
Is this actual italians or the fake american italians that have never even set foot on italy but think they're more italian than actual italians?
i tried Oreo tiramisu ( yes that exists ) AND ITS BETTER THAN NORMAL OREO ITS AMAZING
A legenda em português😂. O Brasil ama vocês ❤😊
Ich nehme auch die Schubkarre 🤪
Tiramisu!
Aint no way
Non è vero.
Con uovo cotto o crudo?
in Italy the bathtub is used for tiramisù
I'm argentinian and I APPROVED! ❤❤❤
TIRAMISU IS LIFE!!!
It's never enough tiramisu!!
My wife: there is something wrong in the Italian version of tiramisù. The spoon is small🤣. But Approved!
Perfect music

My money is not enough so im the rest of the world eating tiramisu (i luv tiramisu🇮🇹🍰)
Ok, ich bin definitiv Italienerin! 😂

I see that Big Tamarasu 😢
Tiramisu is one of the best desserts ever made by Italians
Explanation:italians likes tiramisu too much because of the coffe
Tiramisu is my favourite dessert and… |'ㄥㄥ ㄒ卂Ҝ乇 ㄚㄖㄩ尺 乇几ㄒ|尺乇 丂ㄒㄖ匚Ҝ
then I'm relieved, not only me eating it in mass :)
Why am I watching this while fasting🙏😭
I’m Italian and … absolutely hate Tiramisu.
So I am Italian while eating tiramisu despite my Piast blood. Fascinating.
LoL🎉
yum
Thank you to Italians to bring me so much joy in my plates.
Waiter waiter! One W H E E L B A R R O W of Tiramisù please!
🤤  I might die eating it, but I'll be happy about it when I go.....
you didn't waste it after did?
The only way to quantify tiramsu is not enough.
like the italian mode
Interesting😂
Always  need more😂🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌
Ig im Italian now cause that’s my favorite dessert
😂😂😂
Whole new meaning of you are what you eat also is the wheel barrow clean?
As a Turk, I can say that we are the second state that loves Tiramisu the most.
Nah, not enough
That’s how I would eat it!!!!!
If I could eat that I would.
Finally found something the Americans don't do (yet) 😂
🇩🇪2:1🇮🇹
Not for the first time, I wish I was italian.🤣
and the diabetes going up 😅
I think I'm going to invest in the Italian way
🤣🙌❤️💯
I wouldnt even be surprised if the italians have a giant plate, the size of a house, filled with spaghetti at this point
Broski is gonna mine it but APPROVED!!!!❤
The size of that desert looks about right. What you’re missing is that it is for your family of 250 or so cousins, aunts, and uncles who is over for an informal get together.
I'd do that for a birthday! 😂
Да, это моя любовь к тирамису! ❤
L'unico modo per mangiare il tiramisù! 💯💯
I eat them the Italian style - well, I did - and then I got a diabetes diagnosis ... Well, it was good while it lasted.
Noo! Not approved
APPROVED🫶🏻
💀
THATS THE BIGGEST TIRAMISU EVER

I would be able to eat that whole thing (if it was gluten free)
Nah i may be American but pls lemme have a seat at ur couch to devour it with you❤❤ (not to self, dont walk by a movie playing while using speak to text)
As a filipino who lives in Los Angeles I want that Italian tiramisu 😋😋
I don't like it. Maybe bc it's from Olive garden
You ever have a bakery soft, chooocoooolaaate cannoli? You ever have a whole tray of them? _Little Italy around Philadelphia!_
I must take DNA test, I might have some Italian  🧬  coz I eat just like that ..😂❤
Italians life:   Breakfast: coffee and cookies Lunch: pasta and wine Dinner: pizza and wine Dessert: BIG TIRAMISU
Honestly I NEED this for my birthday (Even though I'm not italian at all)
I think im italian bc i love tiramisú
Ok. I am ready to marry an italian now!!
Diabetes : 📈
Hey save some for me I've never had any

I WOULD EAT THAT ALL
Why am I getting hungry?
Dont know how to make it.  But it is wonderful.

What does it taste like?
I envy Italians  😢

As a quarter Italian, nothing special to see here!🎉❤😂
That's too much that's too big. You're gonna get fat.
Now thats really the only way to eat tiramisu
Хотеть
That Small? I Thought Italians Would Be Bigger No?
italians and brazzilians because we like pave that looks like tiramisu
Here’s the thing: I use an excavator to transport my tiramisu But i like pineapple on pizza  What am I?
They should make gallons
🫰🫰
.... Cualquier cosa es mejor que una ración gourmet
I found out a place nearby sells an entire tray for $50 and if the parking situation was better I’d def be doing it but I can’t trust my clumsy ass to walk with a tray of precious goods
i going to eat a pizza with pineapple
Eat it with a shovel.
looks heavenly but strange 🤔
In my defence, I'd eat it the same way if i had the money
still not enough
They obviously haven't seen American serving sizes...
Thats a bit much okay? dont say the rest of the world if u means the USA
One of my favourite desserts but holy moly how the heck do they eat all of that??😂😂
now... not a wheelbarrow, but that little piece in the first shot was "sadly small" (Pole's perspective)
This isn’t enough
Till this date, i thought that Tiramisu was a Korean dessert as i have seen those Korea asmrists eating it in bulk...😅. I was surprised to know that it is an Italian dessert woww . Btw looks delish😊
OH MY GO-
You need to plus third side. Who just watched to people who eat this. I hate tiramisu. I don't eat it. Sorry.
Do not eat so much..or you will look like me later
*adds wheelbarrow of tiramisu to bucket list*
Til I'm actually Italian
Right from the middle!  O love it
More like biggermisu😂
Does my tiramisu eating habit make me Italian?
Pero en Mexico es carisimo
O türklere yetmez
😂😂😂😂 we love Tiramisù. I think it's one of the few desserts that unites all the Italian regions. (Each region has its own typical desserts, but we all make tiramisu)
“Finally a large cheese pizza just for me”- home alone
So I'm Italian
Ждем следующие видео где целый бассейн тирамису
Не не не, я тоже хочу есть тирамису именно вот так вот ложкой из большой тачки 😍😍😍😍
I do the same thing am i an Italian now?
I need to go to Italy... Immediately
Yummy!!!
Funny, 'cause it's true.
I really hope you didn't waste this food... Although I'm getting a bad feeling
My FAVOURITE dessert. Why am I not Italian😭
Approveduh!!🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻
If it didn't make people gain weight, we'd all like to eat it by the barrel
I feel attacked haha
I’ve always wanted to try that well I’m not gonna lie. I thought it was like a seafood dish for some reason. I never actually did  know what the heck it was.
That’s my dream now 😂
- 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Approved.
I am generally curious on how they would react to the tiramisu flavor of oats overnight that they make that has coffee be interesting to see if they could collab
NO SHOES ON THE CARPET!!!
what the...
Ive never had tiramisu 💔
I need that and APPROVED
If Tiramisu is on a menu, I'm getting it, zero questions asked. I don't care what else they serve. Just leave the whole tray at the table.
This is why I love Italian for some reason, I so like it
I love tiramisu
Nope get the snow shovel and a pool full of it
God I love Louis Prima. Yall rock!
Aaaand now im craving tiramisu lol, probably my number one favorite dessert.
Ive never had tiramisù
😂😂😂😂 I want to be Italian 😋😋😋😋
He had to start eating from the middle 😮‍💨
You guys are not Italians
Ι didn't know I'm an Italian!😅
Random fact I want to tell you, I found spaghetti anf Tiramisu in a japanese restaurant (It’s not on the kids menu)
I WISH😂😂😂
The finest dessert ever created, understandable and I fully agree
I could destroy that in one bite in 5 seconds when fasting starts in 10 seconds
I now have a new found respect for Italians. The fact they can eat that much tiramisu without getting tired of it kinda impressive
It costs so much its good but definitely not worth it lol
Eeew no
Eeeew
That cake on the second is named cake hmad zmel
According to this, i am italian
I LOVE IT
Italians know how live king size
I need it
خرا على ايطاليه
Que bueno
If only... If only I had so much tiramisu... I'd be the happiest person.
It would be the second option for me too 😊😊 Absolutely love Tiramisu. My fav dessert in the whole world ❤❤❤
i wanna be italian now
A japanese name for an italian cake
Its my fav ❤
Since i've gotten older, I can no longer eat an entire wheel barrel of tiramisu.
Accetto tutto ma non dal centro🤬
I identify as Italian.
I made tiramisu for my dad's bday
As arab why are u using a spoon

Type III Diabetes  (It should be obvious why I used Roman numerals)
Am I the only person in the world who doesn't like Tiramisu? 😂
Anyone Italian...can you adopt me pls😂?
Jak ci Włosi są tacy szczupli jedząc tyle pizzy, makaronów i tiramisu?
Now whut ure u gona do with all that
Not true at all
Yes! My neighbor in Rome taught me how to make it. The container you use to assemble the ingredients is functional and you just eat it with a spoon 🥄 very non glamorous 😅
Did... did you actually make a wheelbarrow full of Tiramisu? Oo
it reminds me the tiramisu drawer in the fridge
I must be Italian...
It's litterally so!
TIL I'm Italian
Ok I'm going to italy now
Same with us albanians
Why on earth would start from the middle??? Always start from the sides!
I think I’m secretly Italian
That’s a little too much tiramisù…
😋
😋

Tiramisu is too bitter for me😢
∆
Diabetes : 🙄😢 Diabetes, Italy : 😍😏

I wish i was italian to eat tiramisu...
😆 🍮  I can relate do not put a Flan in front of me (there is no sharing) 🍮 😆
Don't even know what this thing is 😊
Italians are correct, as usual.
And they get mad at people when other people do it
That is equivalent to family dessert food😮
whos eating that much tiramisu?
Look, if my favorite dessert is in a wheelbarrow, that's gonna be the best gift of my life
My anxiety after watching you eating from the middle.
That Ice Cream looks 🔥🔥
It’s too much Tiramisu on monday,,,,
And that's how Italians waste food👍
And Montenegrins!
Y se puede pedir para llevar?
I think it's over hyped. I don't like that last biscuit layer.
👀 if it's clean, can I have some?
Italians living the people's dreams 😂
The only right way to eat tiramisu 😬
Eating from the middle…?
😋
If only the main ingredient wasn't cheese, aka 99% fat.
Wow
Italian bodybuilder: "I need to hit my protein!"
Insanity is approved. Amazing.
What does Je vais boffer des nouilles mean?

TRUEEEE INTILIANNNNNNNN YASSSSSSS🎉🎉🎉🎉
I hate when im in the restaurant getting like a teaspoon of Tiramisu, when I make some at home its about 2 Kilo or 4 Pounds and I eat half of it alone :D
lactose intolerant people be like 😢. That's me 😣
I am not Italian but apparently I am Italian. 😂
I eat Tiramisu like an Italian 😂❤
Dont come in my feed🙏

How i wish i could get more than one international serving every time i buy tiramisu. Perhaps you guy can send me that big bucket of tiramisu? 🤔
Too small.
This is call diabetes
I’m glad my instincts for tiramisu portions are culturally accurate ❤
Shaving foam and cocoa powder 😂
Maybe i am Italian
What is tiramisu idk what it is please 🙏
I knew I’ve been eating it right. Everyone calls me a madman when I whip out the personal serving barrel.
I don't think Americans can afford to use that many eggs 🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚😅
This is the first time me seeing him not wearing his blue shirt
İT İS NOT APPROVED
LAAANNNNNN
Diabetes: let me introduce myself

I love tiramisu...other than tbe fucking coffee taste
I make tiramisu for funerals, I once did for an Italian funeral and there was a buzz that a tiramisu was being brought. You would not have thought it was to be a somber affair lol
This is literally my dream come true 😮 I love Tiramisu! 😍

Alto TIRAMISÚ se mandaron jajaja unos genios
Tiramisu is overrated
Tiramisu is akin to horse shite
I have an overwhelming urge to shove my face into that wheelbarrow and just start eating. I LOVE tiramisu.
Crap I was Italian and didn't know
Free Diabetes (also 3000. comment)

Where does one buy such a thing
That looks like heaven
What is this
I have never had tiramisu what is it like?
Do all Italians have to carry around their official Italian spoon 🥄 at all times. Kinda like Baptists. My Momma told me to never turn down something to eat .
Wait until you see North-African-French muslim people on Ramadan month
Wait who qas the last guy
I’m American that’s me watching big backs eat it

Apparently I am Italian 😂
Not Italian, however Tiramisu is one of my most favorite deserts, and there's never enough of it, when ordering it at restaurants in my country. So I definitely approve of that full barrel of it.
As a German, I love Mozzarella.. But right now its not allowed.. Pregnancy.. Its so hard

Non è abbastanza
"I'll have a small, please"   the small in Italy:
One of the worst desserts .
My dream
THAT AIN'T A TIRAMISU THAT'S A GIAMISU
Top three dessert. Baklava and apple crumble are probably there too
I love tiramisu
Оливье курит в сторонке*

Heart attack tiramisu  lol😂😂😂😂
Absolutely! :D I learned to make tiramisu in Italy from Italians so when I make it I take out my biggest Pyrex!
erm actually, the quantity of the tiramisu is different and not how you eat it
don't waste food 😢  Not APPROVED
Im with the Italians in this
I don't like Tiramisu. Fat and sugar. No thanks
Eu sendo Brasileira e não comendo igual ao resto do mundo é sim como os Italianos.
Quasi Quasi è pure nelle medicine...
Honestly as a 1/8th Italian I eat tiramisu by the foot. Those little 6" by 12" slices you can get for $12-15 make a great breakfast
And dont forget about romania
Бедные итальянцы - едят только пиццу, пасту и тирамису и ценят только эти блюда только правильно приготовленные
No such thing as too much tiramisu APPROVED!!
Because this we break the pasta
BRO!KHABY LAME HELP ME!

Heh🤣
Cosa ha di così speciale il tiramisù?
Diabetes
Diabetes
Honestly speaking one of the most over rated dessert. Didn't like it. It's waste peace and should be the lowest cheap priced.
Tiramisu was food for prostitutes in Italy back in days 😂😂😂😂😂😂 that's why I don't eat tiramisu at all!!!!!!
I'm Hungarian and this is how I eat tiramisu too
Diabeetus Maximus.
Giurò mă tutti italiani  anche io

Okay but does Italian own Tiramisu cabinet just like the Americans?
Approved👍
Approved big ice cream look
I am going to be dead 💀
I spent way too long thinking that tiramasu was a Japanese dish just because it looks like a Romanized Japanese word. I blame anime.
And you said tiramasu drawer was bad!
Pakai gerobak, apakah tidak kurang..?  Harusnya pakai dum truck.. 😂
Why does that look so yummy 😋
Im lactose intolerant 😢
man that amount of tiramisu, that would cost a month if not more of my paycheck ..... **laughs in poor**

Tiramisu is shit if anyone likes this shit you haven't got a clue about taste
This man finally in different clothes lol
Dont waste food😢😢
THATS NOT ENOUGH !!!!! 😡😡😡😡
Where can I buy 3000 of those for my army. Our recent conquest of New Jersey went well so I thought I should get them a treat.
Nah, I use a bathtub; then it's just the right amount.
Je dois être italienne 😅
Ну и мерзость. В следующий раз, сделать это в общественном унитаз!!!!
It really is that damn good
When it comes to food, you Italians are on another level. 😮‍💨
I love that desert!
Diabetes is on next level 😂
Wait wait wait! Save some I’m coming over!

As it should be! Truckload
🎶There's layers to this, player. Tiramisu, tiramisu🎶

In Germany, we had a burglar in an italian restaurant who did only steal the Tiramisu.

Necesito ese tamaño 🤩♥️
Not even Italian but I would absolutely love a wheelbarrow or two of Tiramisu
Aqui no Brasil é um doce super caro. Infelizmente, só dá para comer de vez em nunca.😂
I'm Arab and I want to eat the whole tray of tiramisue hahaah
O preço do tiramisu no Brasil me obriga a comer pouco, igual ao primeiro vídeo. 😢
MA MAGARI

Sorry…I don’t drink coffee, I eat coffee
I'm not Italian, but me too 😂 This is seriously probably one of my favorite foods on this earth and I est it probably once a week lol Since I was a child I have been obsessed with this dessert!
It is rather in these 30l booxes
I ate Tiramisu last year in my italian class. I didn't like it.
Okay... it's not that good of a dessert
LOL! Thanks.
Hahahahaha real ❤❤😂😂
Truly an only acceptable rule
Aren't they affraid of diabetis or just obesity???😮
If it is good tiramisu, I want the entire pan!  Unfortunately, I have had too many badly made tiramisu and always throw it away after a bite or two.
Мама,я итальянка😂

Who said i have to be Italian to do that i already do it
Yummy i love the Italians for that , approved ❤😮😊
Do you feel proud of that? 🤔  How? 🤌🏽  Why? 🤦🏾‍♂️  🤷🏾‍♂️
tiramisù:❌ Drugs:✔️
A bucketful is the minimum
Try an American with pudding
Depois reclamam do abacaxi na pizza, o cara deve ter pegado isso da obra, com cimento e tudo
Approved
That nerds to be millions of dollars😭
THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH TIRAMISU
I'm gonna need a bigger spoon
Oh I'm italian!
I'm not Italian, but it would be news to me if there was any other way than inhaling the stuff straight from a wheelbarrow! 😂
😮😮😮😅😅😂😂😂❤❤❤❤🎉
I would love to go to Italy just to eat Tiramisu and Pizza everyday... 😊😂
I would like a wheelbarrow full of tiramisu, please 😂

As a bulgarian, still not enough
Знаете, а я как бы не против стать итальянцем в этом плане...
Nah that's how Americans eat Tiramisu
Ricky limon ?
Tiramisu small expensive portions are bs pushed by greedy companies, it doesn't cost that much to make for a 50g portion to cost 6$
Oh , that's just the right amount of Tiramisù I need 🤤🤤
Maybe I’m considered an exception in the rest of the world, but I’ll choose the Italian way. And I’ll do it with two spoons because I’ll use both hands to avoid wasting time.
Hchizen arrive
Tiramisu sucks
La leggenda narra che il muratore albanese sta ancora cercando la sua carriola 😂
average amount of tiramisu consumption by an italian
I thought it's the reverse, cause Italians have more deserts than Tiramisu, but abroad in a Pizzeria, it's the only thing you get. Also, Italians are less overweight than other nations.
Thats meeee
أحرم عليكم مفطرين رمضان 😡😡😡
It's good but overrated for sure
Il mio sogno❤
Haha a fricking wheelbarrow
Uh uh uh elbows off the table thank you 😤
This will let u stay awake for 40 days man
Tiramisú ✅ Diabetes ✅✅✅
Disagree. I love tiramisu, but if I don’t inhale that cocoa powder at least once while eating it, it ain’t me.
I think I am italian
The only true one to eat it. Bring me wheelbarrows of tiramisu. Even if I have tasted something even better than tiramisu with coffee. It’s English, I know right? UK and food? Hahaha, but it’s really good, with banana and some dough and syrup and a name I already forgot.
Bro got a whole wheelbarrow to eat tiramisu instead of getting a truck load of it
I approve of the size. However: IS THAT CREAM?!? THERE IS NO FUCKING CREAM IN A PROPER TIRAMISU!  I hate it when restaurants call something "Tiramisu" but then it's some creamy shitthingy.  Tiramisu is: Eggs, biscuit and Mascarpone. NO CREAM!
Squirt some ketchup on there.
Puedo decir que me identifico con los Italianos, amó el tiramisú ❤❤
Tiramisu is the best sweet dish i ever had
*Dies because heartattack*
İtalyanlar da kendilerini en marjinal millet sanıyor
I want in Italia
I must have Italian in my blood!
Perché la crema mascarpone è bianca in quella carretta😂 non so usa la panna nel tiramisù 😩😂
E' verita!
Dude, as a Mexican adoro totalmente il tiramisù ~
if you like tiramisú that much is because maybe you dont know about other italians desserts ...
I must have Italian blood 😂😂😂
As a person who's born in Italy but both her parents are from Bangladesh… I ✨APPROVE✨🤌
No soy italiana, pero si podría comerlo así 😂
Italians are "too much!!!" in everything!!!🙄🙄🙄
Still to little in my opinion
🤣🤣🤣
No sabía que era italiana, y yo toda mi vida pensando que era española😂
Postre sobrevalorado y del montón.
No, no, no! 😮😮😮
Algiers 🙅🇩🇿🗣️⚔️💣🤫🤫🤫🤫☠️☠️
Never had it before.
I am partly Italian it seems 😂

Also one barrow isnt enough by the by, u need a second on hand and a third to come, the hospital ismt far incase😂
As an aussie ill eat this in the same anount... However ill go one vetter, im gonna be grabbing a spatula for it.. not some baby spoon
I actually want to eat tiramisu like pack of cakes
It's so hard to make a good tiramisu :(
Tiramisu is the only reason I want to visit Italy 🤗
As a Turkish, I love Tiramisu. I think world's best dessert is Tiramisu.
But guys why do i feel like tiramisu is so overhyped like yeah its good but def not the best for my taste 😭🫡
Wish I was an Italian now
first time seeing a non-muslim eat outside in the day in ramadan
The only problem with tiramisu is that ihere is never enough...
lol, almost true. diabetes aside...
The first I had tiramisu was the last time I had anything else for dessert
My eyes popped out😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
We mistaken Tiramisu as a Japanese desert. But I learned that is Italian.
So how can that fit in your stomach?😅
Tiramisu is overrated
As a brit with more than my fair share of Mediterranean DNA I’ll take the wheelbarrow every time!
Its never enough tiramisu!😂
Sarà cmq troppo poco
I'm sorry but that's not correct. I personally only eat the second way. :D
Yes! That the right way! Approved!
That's why I live in Italy now 😂
Haha 😂😂😂 funny
Oh, I'm totally with you about the size. When my mum makes tiramisu, I can't control myself🤤, but please don't start eating from the middle!😅
unhealthy sugar ,mascarpone realy bad...italian food realy bad so not healthy pasta sugar white flour 😢
Everyone is like this
Their hypocritical.."don't waste food, not approved"...then they do this
ill say something controversial : tiramisu kinda sucks as an desert. I;d eat like 100 other things before i'd come anywhere near eating it
Don't you think Italians over hype their food
some people breathe oxygen. others breathe tiramisu
😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤thanks its iftar timing happening here in India,🎉 i will make this coffee pudding 🙏
Guess im now Italian.
Idk why is Emiliá wearing something else not the blue shirt
Sogno un tiramisù fatto solo di angoli
Man, I'd LOVE a wheelbarrow of Tirimasu
So I am part Italian, nice! Vaffan.....! 😂
How do we tell them the rest of the world also eats tiramisu by the bucket 😅
I'd absolutely love having so much Tiramisu!
Damn
Я бы съела столько же) да где взять😂

Please someone say that tiramisu was a bubble soap 😂
I must be part itallian, the only way you can have enough Tiramisu is if you eat so much your stomach explodes, seriously, that stuff is beyond delicious!
Sooo, where can I apply for that italian sized tiramisu?
as someone who loves tiramisu, its not that we dont eat it alot, we just dont have the money.
Italians when the 2 words Split it sound like, "eat alliance".
Texas size? Texans: (no problemo:)
Umm... looks delicious 😋.  I would love to eat that much tiramisuuuu ❤😂
The pull of the crotch laughing out loud😅
I like tiramisu in a small glass container.

I don't like tiramisu or cannoli. I'll eat dinner in Italy and go to France for dessert.
Song: Che La Luna

Ragazzi non state usando gli strumenti adeguati: serve la vanga e l'imbuto, è importante utilizzare gli strumenti adeguati per ogni evenienza
So you say I'm Italian ?
Everyone is cordially invited WITH A SPOON😊
Worlds most eaten dessert
Tip:do not feed your kids tiramisu because it contains alchol unless its alcohol free
Tiramisu, spumoni and gelato are all my favorites. ❤Italians!

Tiramisu jest ch*owe
I am currently in Spain, and people here know nothing about quality coffee or desserts. :( We were driving through Italy and stayed for a few hours in a tiny city near Verona, and my whole family keeps bringing up the tiramisu we had there way too often. 😅 My husband even suggested we move there😂
Oh thats my father...orders an entire pan...then eats it every now & then puts it the refrigerator.....tomorrow he wakes up.......half of it was gone🤣😂🤣
Voi non Mangiate il vero tiramisù, quello vero è fatto con il marsala
Have you seen the price of mascapone? This wheelbarrow is equal to my retirement fund.

😮
I belong to "the rest of the wordl" but I totaly see myself as an italian in this case
Why is it so BIG!!!!!😱
Que rico 😋🤩
Отправьте ему пиццу с пельменями
This is exactly my amount of restraint when it comes to Tiramisu
Using this logic, I am Italian. For me, there is no such thing as "too much tiramisù".
you should only eat it the italian way
Если дело касается Тирамису, то мы все немножко становимся итальянцами 😂
But the real recipe of Tiramisù✨💚🤍❤️
Bring shovel to😂😂😂

10 spoon for happines 100 spoon for legs 1000 spoon, welcome to heaven
Italiano never wasting food like this , not approve
As Polish person i prefer Italian way too.🤌🤌🤌🤌
oh hi
Eine echte Tiramisu ist wirklich lecker. In Deutschland wird es in den meisten italienischen Restaurants mit billigeren Zutaten, mit wenig Mascarpone teuer angeboten. Schmeckt nur süß und matschig. Besser selber machen, da weiß man was man hat.
What does it actually taste like though and where can i get some
Tiramisù ????
Solo?
Tiramisu overrated
*_*
ı want eat like a italian
I would take the wheelbarrow, please. I love Tiramisu so much.

„I’ll take your entire stock!” ~ JonTron
I love eating this desert, it's my favourite
😂 but how do they stay that slim
I think you need a little more Tiramisu
I'm sorry that tiramisu is not for me
I would have diabetes if I ate that much and I would more than likely die from having that much
Why the spoon is too short
That's a nightmare ....
FOR YOUR HEALTH
Here I am, at 2:30 in the morning, watching Lionfield shorts, and this slays me like those food waste reactions I've seen in the past.   😂
How to have infinite tiramsù:
My dairy intolerance says i can't have it italian style.
So that's how I learn that I am of Italian descent?! 😂😂😂
I’ve never seen Emiliano(?) in anything other than Blue!? He looks gorgeous

La pauvre lindy 😂😂

Don't waste food
Ewww tiramisu...
Moj način! SVE  manje je vic❤
I don’t like tiramisu
That's how much i would need to be satisfied
Many people likes Italy because of the food.
Im italian, so i can traslate the name, "tirami su" in italian means "pick me up"
Ok so I'm sorry but please tell me you ate all that and didn't waste the food
Real
How is the diabetis statistic for Italy?
Okay, this was very funny😂
If youre going eat tiramisu, eat a load of it or just dont.
एवढा नाद नको करायला

God bless Italy.
Oh to be Italian :(

Italian's Tiramisu is so good i like it.

Ever since i tried tiramisu, i got addicted! I need more tiramisu!!

Caseoh: "This looks like a haircut."
I've never been so sure of my Italian heritage. No matter how much tiramisu I eat I always want more 😂

Come on man. I'm just eating a small plate of dessert😂
Most overrated dessert. Don't get it.
I always thought that tiramisu is from japan
This is why tiramisu in italy are za best
Perché il titolo è in spagnolo?
The Italian way should be the only way
approved 🤌🤌🤌
I'll be honest. we don't eat like Italians because we can't afford too. A cup of Tiramisu is usually priced around $10 to $6 USD  And we can't afford to dedicate our fridge space to the amount of Tiramisu we want.
Tiramisu a la Diabetes 🤌
Que poco es eso
Gimme more than that
Until now i realize that i eat tiramisu like a Italian

Tengo uqe decir. A mí solo me gusta el tiramisú sin emborrachar. El alcohol le mata todo el sabor en mi opinión
You can have my share, Emiliano. I know I wouldn't be APPROVED!, but I hate all things coffee.
Hideously....  seriously  killing 2 birds with one stone Working while enjoying your 🍰❤
I am not Italian but I eat it like a Italian😂
I eat with a fork actually
Rest of the World: yum tiramisu. Italians: YUM TIRAMISU.
Nah, thats just a snack they eat it out of trucks.
Love the non-italian costume, very convincing!
Hi
Didn't you not approve someone eating it in their fridge drawer? This seems a step above that 😂
Still not enough
Damn, I guess I'm Italian now
I think you need more tiramisu
So i'm Italian. I love tiramisu.

Lionfield what does basta mean?
Pls.😢 Albert Cancook leftover pizza video download,pls!!!!!!!!!!😢😢😢
Why would you use a spoon? It's natural to use a fork since it's a type of dessert, like cake.
Italian government permission
Italian or Portuguese
How much of that wheel barrow is real?
Tiramisu is my favourite too especially with vodka in it! ❤
I don't like tiramisu-
I love Italian food, I love (good) pizza, Parma ham, pasta (we French people will never thank Italy enough for pasta), tomato sauce, osso bucco, and so much more, but I really don't like your desserts, and esp. tiramisu.
Tiramisu is my second favorite dessert personally Italy knows what they’re doing
Diabetes, please call the medic !
Tiramisu is best
Tiramisu 🇮🇹🍰♥

I'm from Slovakia and I would be able to do it too. And at Christmas we have tiramisu for dessert
🇮🇹flag=🇮🇷flag
i'm french,  but I've been used to cooking and looking at recipes from their countries of origin or with the help of people from those countries, and I only know Tiramisu served in a rectangular Pyrex dish. I even "argued" with the grandmother of a friend from Sicily about the amaretto or marsala debate in tiramisu (we were laughing so hard while arguing that the neighbors came to participate in the debate)
here in hungar wish i could
Aproovo
I was today years old when I learned I was Italian
Turks same...
Halo i islam can you stop eats i puasa
Oh man, I had my serving sizes all wrong
Siz hayıdır lan tiramisu turkish food

Сахарный диабет?  Нет не слышал

Mis hijos!!! Ellos creen que deben comer el tiramisú por kilo!!! Hubo peleas por el tamaño de la porción y por la cantidad de porque come cada uno. La solución? Un tiramisú por hijo. No tuve otra salida.
Non siete italiani perché non lo parlate
Только не заглядывайте в меню додо пиццы

What is this Italian song btw
Mom loves it
I stopped eating sugar, feeling great
Mi mother make tiramisu the best ❤
Who had given you the license to cook? 'The Devil!'??!? 😂
Eeeh raga abbiamo il tiramisu
😂
YAAAAA
That is my dream
As italian, that is preposterous.  I never eat tiramisu with a little spoon!
I would be willing to suffer everything I would have to to ensure all that tiramisu is eaten before it goes bad, even if I have to do it all by myself. Anything less feels like sacrilege.
Wiwwwwwww
ITALIANS ARE CRAZY!
But isnt tiramisu good with ketchu-
Rest of the world? Thats not true! I would eat a whole truckload of Tiramisu! In the past, the mother of one of my best friends (Italian) made a Tiramisu every year for his Birthday party and people had to restrain me to prevent me from totally obliterating the whole Tiramisu!
Tek Türk ben miyim 😅😅
A wheelbarrow full of tiramisu could easily become food waste.
My dream 😂😂😂😂
😭😭
And this cart only for breakfast.
Hiii from Palermo ❤❤❤
Well, it's the perfect way to keep your tiramisu with you all day!  If you're working in Construction don't get the wrong wheelbarrow, concrete is not as delicious and digest as tiramisu.
what in the world..are you going to finish that alone?🥄👤
Tbh I'd eat the entire thing. Shoot I just realized IM FAT😭😭😭
Doing that on your carpet is just evil
https://youtube.com/shorts/XWDXa_c-H38?si=6Ye9uaCsRKVXpioS

"How did you manage to earn 10 libs when you were in Italy?"
That is so unhealthy
ben yes tukiye

And somehow all Italians under the Age of like. 40 look Models anyway. How? What’s the secret?
Bro next can you review Italian coffee
E vero il tiramisù è buono

Diabetes is coming🗿
Tiramisu is a very below average dessert
Best desert ever tiramisu
Creo que se murio🫥🇮🇹
سلام عليكم
And thats why they called EATalians
Me:that is too much Italian:this is normal
What is that I never had that before
I'm shocked he was so dainty about eating it out of the wheelbarrow. With that much tiramisu, I'd expect him to utter a bloodcurdling scream and stick his face directly into the wheelbarrow.
Wait, that was real tiramisù?!
😢мАЛ
Tiramisu tatlısının hikayesini bilenler👊🏿
I break your spaghetti
Sono felice che ora nel titolo sia utilizzato il giapponese, rendendolo ancora più facile da leggere. Grazie per l'interessante video

I’m not Italian at all. But I would crush a wheelbarrow full of tiramisu.
👌👌👌
Size is still a little small
Siiii
me thinking tiramisu was japanese:
OMG i wish i had a wheelbarrow full of tiramisu. The abdominal agony and weight gain would be totally worth it. My favorite desert❤️
Tiramisu is so effing good idk why to not roll it in a TRUCK instead of that roller
Im curious what exactly Is that dessert.  I have no clue what Is that.
I tuoi video sono sempre belli amico mio
I must be Italian then because titamisu is my favorite, and I'd eat a bathtub full of it if I could 😂  My name is Bianca, so maybe my Black self really is Italian somewhere down the line
When you got addicted to tiramisu

😂😂😂😂😂 I'm Egyptian and eat it the same way too❤❤❤ Mediterranean love forever
I'm not Italian but I felt that the quantity of the first tiramisu was not enough, I liked the tiramisu cart better.
That's even worse for health than us Americans deep frying everything
Most of the world not knowing what truamise is
Why eat with spoon? Use shovel instead!
And it all went to waste :)
It's technically one serving 😊
Italians prefer a Class II lever fully covered with Tiramisu 🇮🇹🍰.
not the white carpet
That's too much 😂
NOT APPROVED 😂
Mama Mia
イタリア料理最高！！！！！！

One of the best desserts OF ALL TIME!
That must have been hard to make 😂
❤❤❤❤❤❤😊
Are they good? Thought Tiramisu translates to a pick me up.  What are they dealing with where they feel that much Tiramisu is adequate?
*sound has left the chat*  *sound has joined the chat*
Tiramisu is the best one 💕
The only time I do not have Tiramisu at an Italian restaurant is if they have run out.  Portions can never be too big either as far as I am concerned.
I NEED THIS CAR WITH FULLY TIRAMISU
Have you seen the Pure Vanilla ✨️Tiramisu✨️??
夢のような食べ方!!
I am not Italian but I LOVE TIRAMISU ❤❤❤❤

I have arfid and tiramisu was my number one food i was terrified of eating (i tried it as a child and 45 mins after eating it the worst stomach bug of my life started and i convinced myself it was rhe tiramisu that made me sick) and i have to say thank you for all your videos featuring it as last week i tried it without fear and panicking and absolutely loved it ive now requested it for my birthday cake for my 30th in a few weeks!

never tried a tiramisù, but apparently it's good... so it technically it's perfectly ethical to eat it like that
And then you complain about pizza monstrocities 😏
Why not use a bigger spoon 🥄😂

Tiramisu is only good for 2 or 3 bites. Then the flavour becomes boring
Relatable
Ok, I may be Italian

Mi postre favorito es el de nata dulce, café y galletas "sencillas".   Del tiramisú no me gusta el biscocho ni la excesiva canela.  De hecho no soy fan de los bizcochos ni bizcochones en ninguna de sus modalidades (tartas, postre, solos...).  Lo que hay! 😅😅😅

“How much tiramisù do you want?”  Italians: Yes.
O yami yami😂😂
I got Tiramisu from an Italian food truck at my old college campus for their 10th year anniversary once and I absolutely loved it. It's a delicious desert that's tart yet sweet, but not sweet to where it feels sickening. It's moist, fluffy, and light.
What a hell I that
I never had tiramisu.
Oh, smaller than usual, you will have to bring some more several times.....
se io mangio così tanto dopo mi famale la pancia 😢😂❤😂😂😂
Pure il carretto di tiramisù😂
As a Turk, I love Triamisu....
Oooooohhh where can I get the second one ?  Amazoni ?
Iven if I'm not Italian I'm willing to pay triple for some tiramisu
If only humans could have unlimited calories and sugar.   I'd eat almost enough pasta to make me sick and finish it off with Tiramisu.
In Brasil a little cup is too much expensive
Gli italians 🤫🧏
If i could afford to make a giant one i would
IM MOVEING TO ITALY
I didn't know that, I'm Brazilian and I've never touched a tiramisu.

İ am from turkey and ı swear it is so funnyy
🇹🇷❤🇮🇹
It makes me hungry right now
I'm Armenian 🇦🇲 and yes we eat like that it's so good
Ma davvero 😂 una carriolata me ne mangerei. E mi fa ridere che in alcune nazioni,spesso asiatiche,di savoiardi nel tiramisù non se ne trovi quasi traccia perché, diciamolo, la cosa più buona è il savoiardo quando si inzuppa di caffè e lo affondi nella crema al mascarpone. Senza savoiardi non è niente. Ah per puntualizzare di panna, nel tiramisù vero, non c' è traccia.
That's not enough
😂For Algerians, Tiramisu has another meaning. If a girl gives it to a boy, it means that she admires him.
my father brings me tiramisu from la scarola its the best italian restaraunt in chicago
So Im atalian now?😂

My inner Italian wants two carts of tiramisu, and that's not the final requirement😂😂😂
Vero troppo vero
Tiramisu is my absolute favorite dessert to have and/or make. I sometimes do wish I had a whole cart's worth too... It's too good~
I think because in America food is almost tasteless. To make it tastier they add more sugar.
This pocket spoon is to small bro 😎
Buonasera @Lionfield come va? Io sono di Russia ma sto imparando a parlare italiano
please remove the AI dubbing in your vids guys... it ruins the audio and i can't change it to the original audio track on my pc :C

That is way too much tiramisu
Los españoles también lo comemos así 😂😂😂
As a romanian,atleast in my family,whenever the tiramisu finishes setting,we eat it straight out of the dish/plate! Just taking random bites. Rarely we ever plate it up,and if we do,its portions that are like,the size of your head.
Tem pouco

Итальянцы с едой явно сошли с ума! 😂😂😂😂 То гневаются – когда в пиццу добавляют слишком много сыра, либо – когда пасту разламывают пополам, либо в строительную тачку состряпать тирамису . 😂😂😂 Да их вообще не понять в этом плане. 😅
Ciao, mi chiamo Chira sono Italiana e tu ?
اصحاب ريمه اوف😂
I broke a pasta yesterday
Relatable.  (I’m not even Italian)
From Tiramisu to TiraMASSù
Sooooo I’m Italian? 😂
I'm only 1/4 Italian and I could bathe in Bolognese, gnocchi and Tiramisu. 😅
❤😂
Is it chocolate?
Tirimisu is my favorite! Its so light and fluffy...it even has coffee flavor, one of my favorite dessert flavors! Bless you Italians, kings and queens of comfort food❤
my mother also likes making tiramisu, selfmade tastes so much better than bought!
I born in Italy 🇮🇹 I speak Romanian but I always eat Tiramisu
My dream
It's never enough, even when you're full. IT'S. NEVER. ENOUGH! YOU CAN ALWAYS EAT MORE!!!! EAT MORE!! NOW!       If you don't mind xD
honestly thats the only correct way
I need to move to italy right now 😍😍😍😍
I want that barrel of tiramisu...😋
Ну што приятного аппетита
Chefcoudy diabetes 99% Italians eating tiramisu diabetes 100%
@Lionfield I have a genuine question about Italian culture and cuisine. We all know it’s not traditional to put pineapple on pizza or break spaghetti, but is it alright to ask for no cocoa powder on Tiramisu? I don’t like chocolate, but don’t want to order without the cocoa if it could be offensive. Thanks in advance, love your content!
🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌 Tiramisu 😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌😛😋😋😍😍😍😍😍😍
Yes true thats my nonna ration for me when i go visit her in Napoli
They just get a wheelbarrow full of tiramisu and just eat it like nothing’s happening😅
Pin me or I will break spaghetti and eat it with ketchup and eat pineapple pizza...
The giant Tiramisu ive ever seen😂
I hate tiramisu 👎🤢
No, rest of the world is coughing when eating tiramisu xD
originally pizza is a iranian food
My Polish mother could apply for italian citizenship then 😂 she loves Tiramisu so much it was the only kind of "birthday cake" I got throuout my childhood. I knoe it's not a cake but she still made it and put candles on top... Short to say i don't like Tiramisu, but i started drinking coffee fairly early (13 years old)
Italian are only wasting it.
Works for me
Yummy
Uhm... Believe me... If I could eat tiramisu like that, I would. Tiramisu is one of the greatest inventions to ever come out of Italy.
Even my italian dad don't do that.😅
Emiliano: small Italians: giant
Hey wasap guys, today I will show you, how I lose my leg😂
I’m gonna be honest, that’s not enough tiramisu
I'm of italian descent and I totally agree that's the way it should be done ... but convincing my brother to make a whole barrel ain't gonna work I'm afraid :/
You spelled "The correct way to eat Tiramisu" wrong. xoxoxo
My dude that puny spoon is no way big enough
"How many times have you watched this?"  Yes.

-Tiramisu- DIABETES
It would be more accurate if you coughed after inhaling some of the coco powder 😂
Delizioso!
Dont like
Yoo
My stomach hurts just looking at that lmao
Oh no Diabetes
Same as trying to eat "smetana" or "vinegret" in non-slavic regions 😂😂😂
I want this NOW !!!! 😮🎉
Not quite caught up on my Lionfield lore, but I am quite certain the dude eating Tiramisu in the first half of the video is Emiliano, an ITALIAN. It makes no sense having him represent the rest of the world.  What I believe is actually happening is that Emiliano is eating the Tiramisu at the cafe, while he waits for the baristas to load his wagon to take home.  And he made this video to pay the bills.  He did not use a delivery app for this because he respects the drivers, and acknowledges how much work it would be to deliver a wagon full of Tiramisu.
Pues yo tengo q tener algo de italiano!😂😂😂😂
Oh my. This gave me happy in places i didn't know i had. 😮❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ma che cavolo
What??????????
