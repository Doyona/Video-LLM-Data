The real definition of grass to grace,but before that you have to loose yourself to get your real you 👌shadie was polite and kind, don't look at him so much 😂😂then in Every relationship that the man is struggling there must be Amaka,a gold digger,cheater and abad luck just use you and dumb you leaving you heartbroken and desperate,then God bring you shadie who will come and support your carrier and encourage you,nice movie may God bless all our mothers 🇰🇪🇰🇪🥰🥰🌹🌹🌹
Who else has heard don jazz...

For clinton jousha here ❤❤❤❤
Clinton Joshua is the best actor ever ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂
But what's the name of the first song he sang  I'm crushing on the star  Someone should help please
The voice behind this song is top notch  Gosh 😊😊😊
So good and very educative 💯👍
Clinton fans of drama  gather
But Clinton mumu for this drama
Nice movie I enjoyed every bit of it.👏🏽👏🏽
Wonderful movie
I love the shada song ❤❤
😂😂😂entry level with 5 years of experience 😂😂
It's really disappointing to see the lady that was rocking her superior natural hair, wearing an unhealthy wig at the ending of the movie.
Clinton actually has a nice regardless.
Just check that sheer beauty @ 1:26. That's real beauty, no mock hair disgustingness.
All black women should check the real beauty of the girl that's wisely rocking her superior natural hair.
❤❤❤❤❤
you are truly a star clinton ,keep it up much love .
One of the best Nollywood films I have ever watched ❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤ i really really love this movie
Did I hear donjazzy’s voice?
How can I get the song
love it. Gash! so nice.
These people do not have good intentions for him. Mother knows best. This Amaka is really on my nerves.
5:29 don't shuu me like a dog, tf
Wow nice movie. I like
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Am in love with joshua all away from uganda
But you did not gave shade money ee😂😂
Im not sure Clinton actually sung those songs 😂😂😂
drope some heart dekunle
DONJAZYYYYY!!!! Mad stuvvzzz😂❤‍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥1:58:42
His mum saying "PURR" with the hand gesture ...just threw me off🤣🤣💗💗1:53:24
Nahh mehnn... Shade really tried frrrr....and she killed her role as always 🔥same with Clinton🔥  P.S: Clinton has a really nice voice💕
" No,No ..im not doing Yahoo ..im Just a Boy"😭😭🤣🤣....bruuhh this scene is just sad frrrr💔😤🥲😮‍💨...Nahh mehnn they really did Clinton dirty broo.....his broo  is a huge bad influence💔😪
I too appreciate the guy ❤❤❤ my best actor
Who else was expecting the 2k to decline 😂
I love the movie ❤❤❤❤
I love adekunle mom acting❤
His song song status quo made me cry
❤❤❤
Why’s nobody talking about Clinton brother that is so cute and speaks so well
This movie is one of a kind. When an elder speaks, you listen. Life is filled with assessments. Failure is often a stepping stone to success. Influence can be profound, with the power to uplift or undermine. Your sense of self is crucial, serving as the foundation for navigating life’s dilemmas. Big accolades to the cast members. You all rock!💯
The way Clinton was scared for his life when he was getting the money. 😅
Clinton joshua is such a great actor keep it ❤❤❤
My love
O my God this particular Clinton  was burn as a star.this movie is so touching i enjoyed it ❤❤❤❤
Very interesting movie ❤, thumbs up 👍
Best connection I love soso and my favorite Clinton

Adekunle vs Shade❤❤❤
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤
I don't like the names for both brothers dekulay doesn't represent the Star
The voice behind adekunle’s song🥹
Clinton the star boy ❤🎉❤❤
W storywriters
01:25 this woman can make face like witch ooo😂😂😂😂
Let's talk about the wig 😂😉😂
Who is watching this movie on Wednesday 20th you are blessed 😢😢😢❤❤❤❤
Please does anyone knows the name of the singer and the song clinton was  singing
I finally found the name of the songs, and the fact that they are all by one  same artist is so amazing and fascinating. The artist is Exouxia Wilson....wow his voice is soooo good, he definitely has my support from now on! The song in 33:24 is called crushing the status quo, the one in 55:10 is called Marin mayan fanda, the one in 2:00:55 is called believe, and all these are all by Exouxia Wilson....on spotify. When i like sth, i must do research lol
This movie is so good, touched my heart...the way i actually cried. And oh my gosh...THE VOICE....wowwwww, i dont know if its clinton that is actually singing but the song and voice is sooooo good. Does anyone know the name of the songs? especially the one in 33:25 and the last one he sang for shade....i NEED to know the title. The actors and actresses really nailed their roles
Masterpiece 🎉
I can only imagine how long it took for them to act the last scene coz soso looks like someone that can easily laugh   And please producer abeg post the behind the scene   And thank you ma for all your movies    They hit different  More grace ma
I'm impressed with the way Clinton acted. This is a great movie. I'm happy I watched this

We girls should learn something from this movie, the fact that you are inlove with a guy doesn't mean you should make him take you for granted, dont be available for his nonsense because of love speak up for yourself, being inlove doesn't mean blindness or you been dumb.

You have to lose yourself to find the real like seriously ❤
omo the part where Adekunle's mum was on the hospital bed and  he was crying then  he started singing got me emotional ohh 🥹😭 I will not lie 😩😭🥹
Amazing movie
Bayo's Acting is a natural He is a masterpiece actor! Its Just like natural,like he is a natural I want him in more movies! We should learn to appreciate these other actors besides the main stars! Clinton is a Natural too But Bayo portrayed his role of a loving big brother so well that I forgot he and Clinton aren't even related! Bayo keep on the Good work!
❤❤❤❤❤
Good moive❤❤❤

It's Don Jazzy😊😅you needed to see how I was smiling carelessly😂that scene
It was so emotional when Star Bot found that Shade's Pls stand is locked😢maybe she has travelled to South-Africa😢😢
I think Clinton has found his  match SoSo just as Maurice and Sonia
What did you learn?  Never Give Up Na who give up fuck up😢... Star Boy never loose guard even when he lost 10M award
You have to go visit your brother in prison and bring him back home. That means star boy 2 Ok
❤❤❤❤❤
🔥
Hmmm Clinton nearly kiss soso chaiii
Oga don jazzy dey call😅
Keep it up Joshua ❤🎉
Bro should have gone to visit his big bro  It's family 🫡
If u watch this movie,u didn't get emotional then u are wicked person....😭
This movie has a lot of lessons and I made sure I took down notes❤❤❤❤❤
I would like to take this opportunity to express my heart felt gratitude to each and every one of our talented Nigerian actors and actresses.        I have chosen actor Clinton Joshua (Daddy 001) as my favorite actor not because of his looks but because his dedication, passion, and talent have not only entertained us but have also inspired a generation of Nigerians and Africans around the world.     I have been a fan of yours for so many years.   I also introduced you to my friends. Once again, thank you for all that you do. Your effort is truly appreciated, and we look forward to seeing more of your amazing work in future.  Star boy indeed.🎉🎉🎉
So what stopped the mother from telling her son what his elder brother did. That could have saved him.  African parents and telling their kids what to do or not to do without reasons. Mtcheeew
I learnt something in this movie, there are distributions in life its only need focus if you fall wake up and dust yourself and move forward
I don't even know that my favorite actor can sing. It's also a very big yes from me.
This is really beautiful to watch
Inspirational and educative. you're my Star @Omonioboli
Et la version française ? please 😭😭😭😭
Keep it up my love it so nice interesting and good
I just love that fact you don't just create anything but it always a connection to people. You touch lives thru your movies mommy. God bless you
Who sang this song " I AM MORE THAN ENOUGH" please
This movie is just moral lesson  for great upcoming star ❤❤
To be sincere this is the best Nigeria movie have ever seen ❤❤🎉🎉
This movie got me tearing up, kudos to Omoni and all the cast and crew, alot of lessons learnt.
Evil does not announce itself with drums!!!!
Joshua Clinton am fuckin tired of u am really a fun of u but any kissing seen in your movies gasiya  😅😅😅
❤❤❤ 🎉😊 57:00  amazing
This is one of the most impactful and meaningful from Nollywood YouTube.  Amazing concept and lots of lessons to learn
Why are there now? Nigerian movies are doing a lot of cursing and sexual gestures The main reason why I wanted to support Nigerian movies because I was not seeing that and I didn’t have to worry about my conscious being disturbed  I’m a spiritual person who likes to watch movies, but do not to deal with the cursing and sexual gestures  I hope Nigerian movies don’t go that route
This movie is such an inspiration..what i learnt from this movie,is that patience actually pays and God will eventually come through for you especially when you have the right person(s) that believes in you. Kudos to you ma🙏🙏
Soso is a very good actress because what!!! All the emotions. Overall beautiful movie and the music Yas 👏🏽  Thank you Omoni Oboli drama TV
I see every talent Clinton has ...buh the pick-up lines 💔🔥...he is naturally gifted...damn he is overdoing.I don't skip any movie that has that guy's picture. I love him so much. I love everything about him. I'm a guy too so don't mean that I have a crush on him. Buh the guy is amazingly good
This movie made me love Clinton Joshua  and i need more of soso movies
This issue of working experience I thought is only in Tanzania 😭😭 but now I see it’s about in all countries in Africa 😢
This movie made my day
This is the best movie i love it keep it up❤
This is top notch storytelling! Every effort put into this production is definitely worth it.✨🏆🏆  I couldn’t even take my eyes off the screen, lol🥰🥰
😢😢😢
Clinton Joshua for lyf❤❤
Bayo was an agbako sha😢 As much as we pray to have friends like Sade, may we also be good friends like her too.
You go teach me how to love oo
I really need to drop my review here, I really learned alot, firstly you have to be a good influence to people because they are watching, secondly know what you want and go for it, ma'am i just came across your production,and i am glad to say 😊you're one of the best producer when it comes to producing movies, Not just an ordinary movie but the one that would impact all, keep it up ma'am, much love from me ❤️❤️❤️💯

I cried when watching this movie 😣😭,it actually relates to most of us that are aspiring higher and wants to make it in life ,I trust God,that one day he'll remember us and hear our cries ,and answer us ,🌹amen As for the movie ,the inspiration inspires us to keep pushing despite when his crime went viral ,he owned up and continued ❤,that's really thoughtful of him 🌹☺️ Thanks so much I enjoyed it ❤❤

When she was meant to draw the boy closer she told him he could leave her house. Sigh
And oh, Red card is showing on uche jombo tv and CJ is having issues with his daddy there😅. It’s another lesson filled relatable movie about family😊. Let’s watch fam
That I’m just a boy @ 1:34:25 is just so sad, and oh how beautiful it was to see Bayor cover for his brother so that he won’t be jailed with him. Anyway may we not make other people’s family cry while trying to make ours smile😊. To the production team and everyone who made this possible; well done😊
God should actually forgive us for the sin we called lifestyle 😢
Na who give up loose ❤
Omo am in love with the songs in the movie especially the last one SHADE ❤❤❤❤❤
So sweet and lesson filled. ❤❤❤❤

Very beautiful movie. Quite reawakening - Welldone Omoni queen
Pls is true
Good movie ❤❤❤
Great movie, lesson learned! Don't forget where you come from and what your objectives are in life, Clinton's movies are all about life lessons, learning a lot from them and he is definitely a great character, I still wonder why he took this long to boom with this acting talent of his, for ex, Regina was booming since young, but anyways, still happy that he still showed up, shout out from Mozambique🎉!
Shake bom bom
Nice story Clinton Joshua ❤
A real and truly emotional story, phenomenally depicted by this star cast. They are all unique and talented, such vibrant portrayals by each character. 💯 This story has surely inspired me, to keep writing my inspirational poetry! 💌 You know it's good when it comes naturally, God is in control. 🙌🏼 Bravo and well done, Omoni Oboli Drama TV and team! 👏🏼
Cliton ❤❤❤❤
👍
Yes  oo
Data well spent
Clinton Joshua keeps getting better and better in this acting thing. I compared his performance in this movie with when he newly started with Ruth Kadiri and all I can say is “GROWTH”!  Keep moving higher star boy 💫

Ah, this movie! It outlines the strategies of the devil from beginning to end, up until the Grace of God rescues, and God turns everything around for your good  - which He doesn't have to if we would just trust. I meeean....... I'm still reeling. God is speaking through this one, I hope we listen.

Oh mehn, such an interesting movie Normally i’m a good fan of Clinton, and Soso, prettiness   Plus, i’ve never been so captivated by songs like i was with this songs that i was using Shazam to find ‘em😀 kudos to the music artists, i like the songs
Omog this sounds as a very big lesson that someone needs to learn honestly about life
Na really Don Baba J voice I hear 😍🥰
Omo, I no go gree for Kunle again if I were Shade 😂😅😅...too late 💃🏽 Beautiful movie
This guys and messing up better thing 🤞🏽😔
Every older sibling, whether a big brother or big sister, wants to achieve financial stability in order to provide care and love to their younger siblings, family, and relatives. That was all Bro Bayo intended to do, not realizing that his negative influence was affecting Kunle. “you have change ooh, better know what you're doing!” 😂😅😅 1:27:12 I was just observing his hand massaging her ass 😭😂😂
Seriously we need more❤❤❤
Seriously we need more❤❤❤
Seriously we need more❤❤❤

Always stick to your belief, values and principles. Avoid unnecessary compromise.  Thank you Bestie Omoni for this movie
This is a beautiful story! I got so emotional when Kunle missed out on the finals. Only to be almost arrested with his brother Bayo. But God always has a plan, I'm glad he rose again. His mum was always very supportive and I was so happy that he and Sade ended up together! 🎉🎉🎉
❤😂  It's good to see something good
Mama I don't know how you pulled this, but God know this movie has motivated me in many ways God bless you and your crew, God I literally cried.
See me crying one minute and the next I am smiling and being in love ♥️ ❤️
Ask if he was going to kiss her
My God this movie is really nice❤, Clinton Joshua and Soso are really great 😊
Love the song🤞💞

Shout out to Omoni Oboli for this wonderful epic, you're really doing well. Please don't back down.

I love u clinton and kudos to my soso😘
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Clinton Johnsua ❤
Kudos to the script writer of this wonderful movie 🎉.
Omoni can never and will never disappoint. This was just so perfect
Whalahi our celeb Clinton Joshua voice sweet and nice ❤❤
Soso is such a terrific actress.. tbh ans she is naturally pretty.. except of course when she is cooking all those her concotion she use to do in her videos.. other than that.. nah my wife be dat..
Shade na werey, why she dey enter those girls in the salon na 😹😹😹😹
1:33:44 okay na police wey u see make u figure out the kin work wey Ur brother dey do.
Can we talk about Sade, she nailed her role. We need such friends and future girlfriends in our lives. Love the cast.
Who's the artist behind Clinton's voice
1:06:04 keep speaking parables until things go south. You still call a grown up man a child. Explain things to him to halt d impending doom u foresee.
His mother's hospitalisation gave him an inspiration for the quarter finals 41:20
What an elder sees sitting down , you young ones will never see even if you climb an Iroko tree. Always listen to your parents first and decipher later. Who here read animal farm? The cat is an Amaka in this movie. Appearing when it's time for food and disappearing when it is time to work. 😂😂
I give this movie a 100/100. It’s soo interesting, all the casts did perfectly well❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
this needs a part 2
12:33 so she actually heard him speaking about his mother selling her wrappers. It felt like she wasn't paying attention but she did. That's a friend there
En français svp
Sweet music 🎶❤ by the way
Interesting movie 🎥🍿 my big bruh ❤
Pls can I get the titles of those songs ....Clinton sang

Nice story ❤❤❤
41:45 God bless such friends ❤
AWESOME!!   Force to be G—-  These entertainers, are forced to be g— or  Lesbian—-  Is part of the Rituals ILLUN—- Every entertainers, that you see on TV from Hollywood has to do these Rituals  If they see, that you can draw a crowd of people and make money, they will come after you and force you to join them.  The Actors and Actresses are miserable, that’s why some of them become alcoholics or turn to drugs because they don’t know how to get out without losing their lives, or the family being threatened  Some of these entertainers are cloned or they have an evil demon put inside of them.  They are assigned to a handler and all their money is taken. Some of them are so broke.  If you really are a fan, Help them to get free and break that blood contract.  If you’re entertainer, who is new to the business DO NOT SIGN The contract!!!  I’m trying my best to wake up my Black people, Who taught us about? GOD, it was the white slave owners in the white colonizers, Most white people know who this is, but Black people do not !! When you use any of the names, that all of the Churches used, all of these names are The enemy’s names For example, Jehovah, God, Lord, Jesus, I AM and etc.  All these names that we know, belong to the DEVIL AND SATAN !!  We were taught how to worship THEM when we go to these Churches. Every time we use these names, we let them have power over us, and the entry into your spiritual life.  We were NEVER told the truth about our Melanated Righteous Highest Power’s name, that is what I use but pray in your African language.  Lift your head and hands up to heaven and say pray in your mind so the demons and devil, will not hear your prayers, they block and steal them. The enemy is “ Devil “ we were taught to worship him by these names The man who look like “JESUS”  His real name is Cesare Borgia  The enemy created “English” Romans created English in early 1800’s The language English was forced on us !!  The letter “J” was created until the year 1524 by Italian man named Glan Trissian English is a west Germanic language created in 5th to the seventh century A.D.  When you see these entertainers Performing for for them, they’re suffering  They’re being forced to live a lifestyle, they didn’t sign up for. But because they signed that contract,  they are owned by the secret Society (ILLUN—-) When you sign a contract, you can’t outsmart them, they will out smart you,  you only have literally 15 minutes of fame of your life and now they own you, you have to do everything they tell you to do !!  Or they will threaten to unalive you or hurt your family. Some of these entertainers are forced to be clone or have a demon put inside of them.  When you pray, pray to our Melanated Righteous Highest Power, say it in your African language, in the name of his son  Look up to heaven, don’t bend your head down,  they taught us how to pray to Hell And lift your hands up.   I pray to his characteristics, because the names that we use, are not his name at all.  Until he show us his true name, and his Son name  this is how I pray until I get the truth
Ohhh woowwww so this was how they met. That’s so cute 🥰
Another Banger from Omoni, Ma'am steady giving Premium Content back to back  More Hair really looks good on Clinton compare to his normal low cut
Loving you Clinton Joshua 🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹⭐🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹⭐🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹⭐🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹⭐🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹⭐🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹 Star boy

We all need a friend like Sade in our ĺives.
D day I go see Clinton kiss for movie ehn 😂 I go do giveaway dat day 😂
This Bayo guy is probably extremely good at interpreting his character or just plain brilliant.... OR a combination of both... his take on the music industry is spot on....
Self believe  is rewarding  ,just  having  patience
This  is inspirational  I wish  I get  a girl  like  her
BEAUTIFUL MOVIE NICE ONE ❤❤❤❤

Clinton Joshua never disappoints us
Very interesting movie to watch now ❤

We all need a friend like Sade in our lives.
Nobody is talking about the landlady ,she nailed it 😂😂
Are you guys sure the singing voice was our Clinton Joshua??😅😅😅
Thanks for this motivational movie. It has given me strength to keep pushing with my channel. "One day I go blow" 🙏
No one is talking about 😂 those boys who  Were busy bringing the assets outside under landlord command 🤣🤣🤣
You guys we need another part for this movie, I'm Nazzie King a younger raising star also an actor but really the script was my true real life. Thank you so much for the creativity. I really enjoyed it
The movie is breaking  Why
❤️❤️❤️❤️ for soso 🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹 Adekunle mom
The casts are all 🔥🔥🔥.
1:40:04 what stopped you from telling him earlier,I blame the mother for everything 💔
Watching and reading comments
Clint you have a sweet voice,,,wow!!
i enjoyed every bit of this movie!😍
God bless y'all ❤️
Cj is a vibe actor no lie😊
Am a Ugandan ❤..but honestly watching Nigerian movies is my hobby ....Clinton my best 👌 ❤
This is really inspiring 🥹🤭... First time dropping a comment on YouTube cuz of a movie
But when Bayo came back to meet his mother , why didn't he pay Shade back her 750k?
I like this movies and very interested and this gives some lesson to we people are days and C.J why can't you create a page for that your song you sang in this movie because I love that and can't wait to see that boss I love you both C.J and Sophia doing movies together can't wait to see your next movie shaa
There's one salient lesson here and also a warning.  Had it been shade agreed to make out with kunle in bayo's house, she would have been destroyed like amaka. Here's the lesson and warning - for those of you not married yet but making out, be careful. Don't get me wrong, I'm not judging anyone, just saying making out anywhere– at friend's place or roommate or even hotel, some1 might set you up or sets sm1 else up but became a victim 😢. You can't trust on anything or anyone anyhow. Take a moment just imagine urself in being in such situation where ur tape is everywhere, don't be deceived– not everybody can get through problem especially when no one stood by you or u don't even have money to get yourself privacy to recover, cos trust me ppl would come after you... So is either u don't spoil urself B4 settling or be careful with where 😂u make out , don't trust anyhow, find money to settle yourself – be safe in ur house..
I love this guy
Nah only inside movie person dey see this kind girl😔
Who's cutting onions 😅😢.I love this movie
The songs are 💯💯💯❤️
Here for Daniel Rocky❤
Aww such a sweet movie 😢❤
This movie really though me a lesson to keep pushing on my carrier!
So sweet and exciting❤❤
star boy is a amazing movies and the feeling of joshua and sophia its fantasic amazing too so its a very beautiful movies i love youuuuu
Clinton you are one person I love even without the kissing part,we see the mad chemistry and we see how they help you avoid it from the script writer and we love it and love you. This movie is deep and friends like Shade is what we all need. Bayo is a young man desperate to break free from poverty, that doesn't make him a bad person, made wrong choices yes but there  is always room for improvement. Well-done ma'am and cast and crew.
CJ MY GEE✌️✌️❤️❤️
That is  bring inspiration ❤❤❤
Clinton, my 001 crush, you made me cry with the song. I am not done watching it still on it. I love this guy die ❤❤❤❤❤

If you are here for CJ and Soso gather here
❤❤❤❤❤❤ This is beautiful✨✨❤❤
Upcoming artists gather here if you understand the message❤️🙂‍↕️
This movie is so inspiring and i teared up at some point when kunle's mum stood up happily and crying out of joy while watching her son on TV.  I pray to shed same tears of joy over my daughter, she's always loved acting but never got the chance... I'm just a young mum who's 28 and my daughter is 14.  Just pray her desires come to reality by a producer locating her.  God bless the amazing producers, cast and crew of this educating movie❤
Now this is Rugged Love. Straight out of the Streets.
Hmm, Bayo is a good brother, no one want to die in poverty,.. if not for Bayo that house rent wouldn’t have been paid and a lot more… for yhu to know Bayo loves his family.. his password is Mama Bayo…and all the love he shows goes a long way… Poverty is a bastard💔… The movie deserves everything💯
"two vans entering a black gate.... What is the color of our gate?" "Black" "🙆🏾‍♀️🙆🏾‍♀️🙆🏾‍♀️" 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nice voice

Wow Clinton is a good singer
Wow,this is so so great, I really enjoyed it so much. Because this reminded me how my life has been. With no hope,no dream,no focus, all ways serving people from my small age. I saw what was going on to me and my siblings and parents, people always mock us because my father was a drunkard, the community will come and collect the little property we do had to replace the bills my parentscouldn't pay up. Me I was tired already, I had to follow people to do house help, as you did say trouble doesn't finish, when it's time for me to enjoy a story will pop up that am not okay and they will send me back. So my brother I really love what I saw and I do say nothing will stop your stars from moving, and multiplying more than you have ever imagined. Thank you so much and your colleagues. Bye promise uchegbunam.
Wow! You're really an all-round champion guy, you deserve an award Clinton Joshua.
🇹🇿🇹🇿
Love you 🎉🎉🎉🎉
The best part was when she said that she has told everyone in her agency worknor something like that, that she's the shade in the nShade in the song and that she's his girlfriend
Soso,I really like that girl, luckily for me to see her acting with who I also like
What a thriller. ❤🇩🇲

Why can I hear “murder with my husband” theme song in the background? 😂😂 - Love the way he calls her “shade-o”😂😂
Somehow Omoni’s stories keep relating to my life and I don’t know why. Trying to find myself right now
D’boy is a great guy! He reminds me of late Muna obiekwe Bless his soul.
Very beautiful movie, lovely story, amazing cast. Just lovely
So interesting
Nobody is talking about the small small Yoruba….our starboy is saying
CJ my favorite ❤, your voice is melodious, you never disappoint us ❤❤😊.
This gave me flashbacks to that guy who fooled everyone dancing like a girl 😂💀”👇 https://youtube.com/shorts/0NtqV_oNaHk?si=tUVKh4slI2OP5ni9
A touching and incredible movie indeed I throw way salute to everyone involved with the movie you guys nailed it
First, I must say Star Boy offers an inspiring and emotionally rich premise that speaks to themes of ambition, sacrifice, and redemption. I’d like to share a possible narrative direction for the film, based on its current framework, while staying aligned with its emotional tone and character depth.  What if Dekunle refuses to accept an alternative job position after losing out on the one he initially applied for? Though the alternate position still offers a stable monthly income, Dekunle turns it down, choosing instead to join a singing competition, despite the uncertainty of winning. This decision may seem impulsive at first, but what if music is Dekunle’s true passion, his lifelong dream of becoming a celebrity singer?  His mother, however, strongly disapproves of this path, believing music to be an unstable and unrealistic career. Yet, Sade, Dekunle’s close friend and quiet supporter, continues to encourage him, urging him to take part in small singing competitions and reminding him not to give up on his dream. As Dekunle pours himself into music, tension with his mother escalates. She becomes increasingly upset over his refusal to pursue what she considers a “proper” job. But everything changes when Dekunle receives a call that his mother has been hospitalized. Devastated, he blames himself, abandons his music career, and starts looking for work, driven by the fear of losing her. Dekunle works tirelessly in various low-paying jobs, but the funds he manages to gather aren’t enough to cover his mother’s surgery. Seeing him struggle emotionally and financially, Sade quietly steps in, using all her personal savings to pay for the surgery, a gesture of deep loyalty and compassion.  Later in the story, Dekunle begins to gain recognition and popularity for his music. Believing that Amaka, someone he once had feelings for, might finally accept him, he tries to reconnect with her. Amaka shows interest, not because of genuine love, but because she wants to get closer to Bayo, a wealthier man in Dekunle’s circle.  This shift doesn’t go unnoticed by Sade. Feeling replaced and emotionally hurt, she begins to pull away from Dekunle’s life. However, Dekunle’s mother, now recovering, notices his growing bond with Bayo and becomes concerned. Fearing for her son's future and values, she reaches out to Sade, urging her to intervene before Dekunle loses himself. Sade, though hesitant, agrees to help. Together with Dekunle’s mother, she helps him distance himself from Bayo’s influence and return to the grounded, passionate path he once followed. In the final act, Dekunle’s mother takes an active role in mending the strained relationship between him and Sade, leading to a heartfelt reconciliation and a renewed sense of purpose in both his career and personal life.  This storyline could offer a strong emotional arc, rich character development, and relevant commentary on the cost of dreams, the power of genuine love, and the importance of staying true to oneself.
See bad advice which skin song  be shake ur bum bum u make a man go dumb dumb. The way I laughed ehn 😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
❤❤❤
Maame omo Clinton is addicted to this Ghanaian word 🤭🫂
The song Clinton is singing, what's the name of the song ,(hello Shade)?
such a nice movie 👏💯
Joshua 😂😂😂😂 na tokam
Now this is a lesson not a movie ❤❤❤❤❤
Eswatini with love❤
❤
This is more than just a movie, it's a divine message wrapped in storytelling. Star Boy reminded me that no experience is wasted when it’s surrendered to purpose.  The way pain, identity, and gift discovery were portrayed hit deeply.  To every young person watching this,  Please don’t rush past the message.  You were created for something bigger than trends. Your life carries weight. Your gift is needed. And like Star Boy, sometimes your struggles are the very path that leads to your calling.  To the writer ,  you didn’t just write a script, you planted destiny seeds in hearts.  May God continue to enlarge your voice and platform. Keep telling stories that change lives.   ❤❤❤
Why is your main character not projected well on stage while singing?
Love all your movies Joshua ❤
❤❤❤
Love it bestie❤❤❤
Beautiful loves story. I love it.💖💖💖💖💖💖
New update have friend that does POS ✍🏾😂
Thanks to all the casts members and crew members.  I really enjoyed the movie.  You all played your role very well .
As a girl child growing up I never ignored my mom’s advice.  I always took her advice seriously and took my Aunt’s too advice seriously.  Nowadays children as soon as you opened your mouth they took it from you and show you they knew better.  Just because they can manipulate the internet they think they are on the top of the world.  Life is not all that cozy.  It takes a great deal to achieve one’s life goals.  Anyway as Kunlede said sometimes you have to loose yourself before you can find yourself. That’s is challenges in life.
Please can they produce this song on audiomack, I need to stream it🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 Take your 🎉🎉🎉
This Bestie relationships are very confusing.  That is why I have never had the opposite sex as my Bestie.
Goose bobs!!!!! All over me more to learn
Your mother said you needed a friend.  Lol. That’s my favorite line in this movie.
I think raising boys is much harder than raising girls.  Girls are a little bit understanding and  can be tamed in a way.
Star boy you didn’t know but you also didn’t listen to your mother.
What mothers go through, only heavens know it.
Star boy you should have listened to your mother.  Don’t go near him.  Children of nowadays
pls I have been looking for CJ's last song titled Shade, but I'm not seeing it ooh. the song moves my soul.
Shadey is very beautiful
The land lady is giving VEEKEE JAMES🤣
A friend in need is a friend indeed.
OMG. CLINTON JOSHUA has a great voice.

The landlady 😂😂😂😂na another character, that woman na confirm werey .. That guy wey sing DAVIDO song need to be jailed 😂 😂 😂 ahh i laughed ehhh In conclusion, i would rate this movie 10000/10 🎉🎉 it deserve more than that! Kudos 👏
Very annoying and interesting 😂😂😂😂, I'm annoyed because I'm jealous of the love shade was showing him.
Really like this.  The brother was cute.
Last word  You know why because I love you so much  Period 🩸
Purr 😂
Aunty we love this bangers you are always delivering o😊😊🎉
❤❤❤
If you are here for Clinton, oya gather here and like my comment
Women are too manipulative
Watching from USA 🇺🇸   Ooh, this movie is so emotional because it reflects reality. What happens when you have a dream and don't know yourself? Here comes the devil to distract us and using people closest to us to derail our destiny. But God is good! 🙌🏽  when we sit down in isolation and listen and learn from our failures, hearing wise counsel from those who would not let us give up. I had to take breaks watching. This movie got me so emotional; it could be any of us, it was our individual story. Great work with this one now! 👏🏿 👏🏿 👏🏿  And the songs were so good, the lyrics are inspirational (except for the bum bum one).
Friend like soso
Beautiful movie nice one ❤❤❤❤
Beautiful story. It flowed well despite the few loopholes. Well done.🙌🏾
Interesting movie
Wow wow wow  I'm impressed Clinton Joshua my man keep it up bro much love. As for the movie setting, is good, every bit of it falls in place.  This movie is giving. 🎉🎉🎉🎉
The moment the caller said this is don jazzy 😂😂
❤❤❤
The movie was so interesting and Iearn alot there, and I still love the fact that Clinton Joshua is speaking yoruba 😂
Your brother is a jerk, and he is going to mess you up.
He didn't sing that.  Don't fake us out.
All that glitters are not gold you don't know what you have till you lost them 💯 be content with what you have God knows best nice movie with one of my favourite actor Joshua much love keep it up 🎉❤
Landlady isonu
As far as this nigga is this movie is gonna be lit
This is a true definition of "Behind every successful man is a woman." 🤭❤️ Such a great masterpiece...I love it 😍
Love this movie ❤😂
Thou it may tarry but it must surely come to pass, thank God for a second chance❤
In life should never give up it just a matter of time that things will get better, interesting movie ❤🎉
❤❤❤❤❤
These two must marry them selves 😂❤❤❤❤shaddy and Clinton
Lessons to young boys, get your shit together b4 girls..... the mum would have told adekunle the real thing, speaking in parables never help anyone. African parents should learn how to speak to their children in clear language that they would understand...
Premium❤❤❤❤
Soso is the best actress ooo❤
Wow amazing movie ❤❤❤❤❤
Yes he deserves it
Yesoo 1:40
❤❤❤🎉
Wow nice movie ❤ I love this keep it up my crush Clinton and soso

En français s’il vous plaît
When I heard CJ ❤is singing.....I longed to watch the movie to hear the voice 😮
This movieee 😭🙏. There’s so much to learn honestly. There’s really no shortcut to success and God’s time is really the best. This film made me cry cause I can relate to it. I’m really gonna make mama proud cause that woman don too see shege. Make I just finish this final year wey I dae so. I know God’s working something big for me. It might take a little time but I’ll wait cause DELAY IS NOT DENIAL. Thank you so much @omonioboli @omonioboliDramatv @omoniobolitv for this masterpiece.
This movie did not end as I expected! Unlike other nollywood movies that have predictable endings, I’m glad this was a change ❤❤
He didn't even sing.  I hope you do not think, we thought that was him singing in the background.  That was a waste of time
But Clinton should start singing ohh this is de second time he’s acting the role of a musician 🧑‍🎤 this guy is too much❤❤
Nice movie...my younger needs to  watch dis master piece 👌 cos at this point in his life,he doesn't know what he wants... He's easily influenced by friends he doesn't  have a mind of his own... I pray God will direct him 🙏
Omoni don't start o....when u guys produce films every nkwo and eke market day....how do u expect us to watch in one day, I downloaded star boy...yet to watch it, only to realise I hv to download it again. Wetin dey worry una? If person Don download film...its data, what else do u guys need, ? Seems u r just learning this bad attitude
This sophie girl is so real
We need to loose ourselves to find us...  I love every bit of it...
The fact that Don jazzy is involved got me Loving this movie  More and more !♥️
Lovely video ❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
As an upcoming artist from Ghana🇬🇭I've learnt so much from this movie
Awwwwn ❤❤
Clinton Joshua is my best actor 🥰🥰🥰
Wow what a fantastic movie l really enjoyed it ❤❤❤❤❤❤
What a interesting and educative movie, but na inside move true love exist 😢😠😪
27:43 what the helly😂😂
The movie is soooo good,moral lessons and all sort of what i cant say.  The songs also so inspirational❤❤       Clinton Joshua all the way🌹🌹
Here for Clinton❤
Am watching this from osogbo and you ?
My clinton ,i love uuuuuuu
I'm dripping for Bayo  Adekunle's Big Bro.
👍👍👍👍
Am here for Clinton Joshua ❤❤❤🥰🥰😍😍
❤❤❤❤
His mum should have just opened up, the information she kept to herself as to why she cut him off maybe would have given Bayo a sense of clarity as to why he should avoid his brother. Although, he should have known better
Mama the voice is soothing
Wow this movie is Amazing And the songs eeeh awwn
Who else noticed that Clinton Joshua has a very sweet voice and can sing very well 😊
The Lyrics of the Music in the final competition got me real hard. God has taking over the situations of our life. Amennn.
This guy clinton don make me close my company,,, he dey always chop my data
A lovely movie filled with a lot of lessons to learn, but please could you help us reduce the sexual contents in your movies.  I believe that your movies are powerful, captivating and would be a great movie regardless of those contents. I also believe that you’re a brilliant producer who can pass a message without necessarily showing us the act. So please help some of us fighting with lust of the flesh to enjoy a good movie without compromising our discipline 😅😅  Great movie once again ❤ @omonioboliDramatv
2:02:58 2:03:06 2:03:06 this is my best part and this song is life
Interesting movie Clinton, its a 💯
I have watched star boy more than 10 times and I’m still watching 🤦🏽‍♀️never get tired oo😂😂very nice and interesting movie 🍿
Eii nvr knw clinton joshua can sing this well 😮❤😢😊
Shade is a whole mood
Beautiful work....nice
Amazing movie
What do African parents have against explaining their position on things? Dekunle asked his mother why she hated Bayo but she didn't tell him
Omoni oboli did you steal Joshua Clinton from Uchena mbonambo 😂😂😂😂 this guy we follow him up and down  , kudos am loving your work 💪 but don't spoil our innocent crushieee🙏 ashajua romance
This soso  or shade gal is the most beautiful woman in naija very natural and desiplined in all her movies❤❤❤
Omoni dear where is the one nail of the landlady who plucked it out and who is the person in the graduation pic on the wall inside kunle's mom house 😂😂😂😂
Too many moral lessons in one movie. Thank you Omoni...the baddest STARGIRL
1:58 and that’s really don jazzy voice , wow how much Anty omoni pay don jazzy for this voice call 😂
love it ❤❤
love it ❤❤
Lesson passed
Clinton is a born actor💓💖l love this movie my mentor
❤❤❤❤
Oo my Gosh dis movie 🍿 is given one of my bxt so far
Clinton  the best actor in nollywood ❤❤
37:51 As i just saw my man of God on the screen, i knew mama will be fine
I want part 2.... I want to be sure he kept his promise
This movie is very inspiring and a big lesson to everyone watching. But I don't like the aspect where Bayo was rejected and not forgiven because of his mistakes. Deep down Bayo actually loves his mum and brother and he wanted to be out of poverty by all means but went the wrong way. Even though I feel he deserves to be forgiven and loved because no one is perfect and of course a bad child today can be a good child tomorrow. Shout out to all the children all over the world. Happy Children's day
Good job guys 🎉🎉❤❤
Adekunle, Sade and Bayo killed there roles
Infact, this movie is extra ordinary interesting,whao  JOY  AT LAST, CJ &soso you really did a great job, love you both ❤❤❤
51:10 E Says “SANDRA” in a yoruba accent mixed with agbero tone 😅
@main2world
The brother Bayo keeps giving him very, very bad advice 😭. Making the type of music u love for urself is always best cuz that music ends up being classic and timeless! Catchy music goes out of style very fast. Timeline music ages well and will always keep money in your pocket! He should never take Amaka gold digging self back! She already showed him exactly who she was. He should listen to his mother cuz its obvious she has real problems with Bayo. 😭 I gotta see how this ends im only half way through. ♥️
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉u
Wow clition ♥️ never disappoint
Great movie great lessons great cast.... much ❤️ from Uganda 🇺🇬😘
I can't wait to see you in Sierra Leone 🇸🇱🇸🇱🇸🇱🇸🇱🇸🇱
The mother stopped something very nice and i was waiting for it😂😂😂(the kiss😢😂) great movie thank you for the lessons ❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
My favorite place ❤❤❤
I have a lot to say but I will just keep mute for now 🌚  The main question is who will eat that cake they leave there,me am hungry oo☺️😂
I love the part where the name Don jazzy is mentioned,I might not  know much about ❤ lot of record labels in Nigeria but I know Don has been doing a great job by shining  lights on a lot of up and coming artist #he deserve all the credit.
Nothing is new not interested
If u believe that this movie deserves a trophy, give me a like 🎉❤
And Soso wasn't the right fit for this role
Storyline is too basic😢
What a beautiful movie ❤❤
Who noticed that the landlady is actually Itoro, the wife to Oga Bassey 😂
I doubt this is Clinton's voice ooo 😂😂😂 cos eii etooo sweet 🎉🎉
This storyline is similar to that of a Jamaican movie titled "Sprinter" but there are some twists in this movie and that made it even better...😊❤
Soso is really crazy you are looking too much and u re shining ur teeth😂
Chaiii make film no sweet so
Who else cried when the second song was sang that is when her mom was sick
I think everyone needs a friend like shade because, yes it's okay to do whatever pleases you but can you please have a little feelings of the people around?  I think we should learn a lot from this. I love good movie because I want to be learning everyday nice one soso and my fav Clinton ❤
Can someone please tell me the title of the song sang by Adenkule 🎉❤
Wow I really enjoyed this amazing movie Clinton and Soso much love from Sierra Leone ❤❤❤❤
Superstar indeed ❤🎉
The moment I saw Daniel rocky on this movie i knew it a must watch We need more of Daniel rocky on this channel to keep us coming back

At least we can have a decent movie that all ages can watch without any sexual content and still have millions of views. Thank you, guys. I celebrate you all. Take your flowers 💐 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
Such a beautiful movie, they all killed their roles
What I love about this Tv @omonioboliDramatv is that she isn’t stuck with a set of actors. She is versatile and select actors base on script not stint❤
We tend to forget where we cane from at the peak of success
My best movie so far this year   this Genz generation  this food for thought

The person sho wrote the story and the script did a good job, this movie I great. Clinton should try to work on his emotions , I noticed he missed that in some parts.  I love how the brother protected his young bro  and I cried on a bus as I was watching when he said it’s all my fault he knows nothing.   My brother Patrick in whatever you do knw that your brother will always love and protect you

Most importantly, never give up in life no matter any situation you find yourself into.Thank you for this movie, clinton, shade and mama clinton and everyone that made this movie to be possible, i thank you all. 💯

Dear OmoniOboliTv,  STAR BOY is more than just a movie—it’s a mirror to the soul.  What do you do when you’re so close to winning, but one piece of bad advice—from someone who only knows the fast hustle and “make it by any means necessary”—causes you to lose everything? Everything you’ve worked for… gone.  This film made me pause and ask: Does their journey align with my core values?  In today’s world, people only celebrate the result. They don’t see the pain, the pressure, the choices made in silence. But this story captures that silence—and gives it a voice. The kind of voice so many African youths can relate to.  And through all the struggle, one truth stood tall:  Never stop dreaming. After the rain, the sun will come out. We rise, we fall—but we get back up. That vision. That future. It’s still possible. Don’t give up. No matter how hard life gets.  Thank you, Omoni Oboli, for telling our story—with truth, heart, and hope.
The scream i screamt when i saw Soso! And she killed the role. I hope to see her again and again
I love  dis  movie  🎬  so  much  ❤❤❤❤🎉
❤
Clinton has a very beautiful voice, waaaoooow, I enjoyed watching this movie ❤❤❤❤
What an amazing movie. And to our exceptional Director, proudly Oremi Daniel Uzodinma. And our Superstar Exouxia 🥳🥳🥳🎉🎉
"loving you is so exhausting" that's heartbreaking but it's for the best for growth.
Another beautiful story❤
😂😂😂 "the multitude of women who want to have my children "

Who wrote that song? It’s really nice
omo i need all these songs on track so i can listen for inspiration. this is inspiration mode activated. Gbera till i reach the sky. you keep out doing yourself maam! execellence personified. thank you for this movie.
It's hard for single mothers to raise our children but I don't know why men always left us and never look back,we suffer alot but GOD always makes his ways ❤❤❤❤
I love the flow between sade and Adekunle ,it makes it so natural, nice acting
Needs a part 2 when the brother gets out of prison

Im happy they highlighted the rubbish thing companies have been doing. Entry level means beginner. If you know you need 5 years experienced candidates don't fvcking put the term "entry level" on the application.
Mammie Omoni Oboli please come to Malawi,   Am keeping a bouquet of flowers for you.❤   You're doing a great job mah❤❤
We bless God the  Actors. Very educative  Very emotional  Very very good. Joshua was amazing  Mother excellent advice. I would love to watch and watch over and over again Agnes R❤
26:50❤❤❤
It takes a real man to see how much of a gem shade is , some might take her genuine kindness for granted but they all killed there role 🙌 there’s always a way out
Soso is so funny 😂😂😂
At least e chop amaka

Bayoooooh❤ You are the greatest 🎉🙏
Brr is so good damn
❤
Such a good friend I wish I had one
Moral lessons from kunle 1 know what you want and go for what you want  2 in some cases is good you listen to your parents so that you don't get distracted or carried away  3 never take an advantage of someone helping you because they might go and go forever  😊 In conclusion giving up is not an option
Why do i feel like this is the story of Adekunle gold 🤔  Beautifully written
Moral lesson from shade 1 self discipline  2 she has vision  3 she is selflessness  In conclusion you need to hang around with circle of friends that can elevate you to your dreams or your aims in life
Why will shade tell me am shining my teeth😢😢😢
What a wonderful masterpiece!
😂  So Clinton can't sing when em mom dey hospital but he is capable to kiss abi 😂 my guy.

Wow soso and Clinton nice one i can't wait to watch

Sometimes you lose your self, lose focus but at the short or long run you get more stronger,wiser, knowledgeable.This is a masterpiece 🎉❤,the actors killed their roles. And the mum self get blame small, she should have come clean to Adekunle about his brother, and lastly true love wins. This movie really worth my time and data.❤
Netflix project 😻😻😻
Clinton Joshua and Sophia Chisom both had stellar performances in this movie.  I'm a already a fan of Clinton Joshua and now will added "Soso" to my list of favorite actor's and actresses.  Soso is a natural and has unbelievable talent.   Great movie 10/10❤❤❤.SAJ

Got to keep faith cause I’m going far
Omooor this last song was amazing
The connection and ease between soso and clinton is just 😊
Adekunle and Bayo's mother should have told Adekunle the whole truth about Bayo's wrong life. Adekunle would not have lost out on the finals of the Star music competition if she had told him the truth. Bayo's advice on Amaka also caused a terrible setback in Adekunle's life. I am happy that Adekunle was able to start afresh and stick with Sade. Well done cast and crew. This story came alive because you did a very good job.
This movie ate n left no crumbs.great storyline and plenty lessons
Nice one guys i really love this vedio so much ❤❤
Pls where can i get all this music that @ClintonJoshua sang?

Omoni thank you for another great movie. The entire cast & crew were great.  Ayo Adesanya fantastic 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽, a Mother knows her Children, Good Job.
Amen 🙏
Na because of my guy Clinton Joshua made me watch this movie. SOSO you are talented, i love you'll
Adekunle's female friend, Sade is the type of friend that one should never lose. She believed in him and helped him in every possible ( and even impossible) way to rise.
Oladimeji you say? My surname sake!!!
This moving is really inspiring  Well done team❤❤❤
Imagine having a girl like shade in your life
This seems like a new channel! Movie trending on number 1...good one. Let me subscribe 🤪
Soso come to Enugu and take this flower in my hand, you deserve it

Another talent of Clinton is singing
Wow very nice movie and lovely I really enjoyed it from Ghana 🇬🇭 😀 ❤❤
Interesting story ❤❤❤
This is a masterpiece! This is what life is called! This is a story! I laughed, I cried! A struggling mother! A dreamer and his dreams! The rain that comes before the sun! The Process! Rising After falling!  Love!  Definition of patience!  I see a struggling & single mother and it reminds me of my mom when I lost my Father growing up.
A very interesting movie 👍❤.
Right now I really need record label to sign me already did some song and in my recording tools I can get uncountable songs and it's breakes my heart that am not able to do my songs😢
Clinton has a nice voice
This guy u no go kill us ooo The song fine mad❤❤❤
I think Clinton must open his YouTube channel for movies
Life is so unfair 😢 when brayon told Clinton that shade she is like a wife material and he don't need that now 😢😂 so bad
I'm here because of the voice behind Clinton's voice
Beautiful movie with a beautiful storyline.All the cast were on point.well done guys 👏👏👏♥️

Fantastic! Unpredictable! Emotional! Realistic! Well acted! Loved it!!!
This is beautiful 😍
🎉good 👍 one bro, the title of the song 🎵 am loving it
Be surprise na got me rolling 😂
I was reminiscing about this movie some mins ago . Hmmm   😂😂 ( what this movie has done to me , it won't just leave my mind) . Bayo , Adekunle's bro, may not necessarily be  our blood but maybe that : Relative, Friend, Situation, Circumstance,  whose voice may be louder than ours trying to drown out our Ideas /Dreams just for us to lose focus and be distracted.
I love the music especially that am crushing the stardon stone❤
That's my boyfriend, come and see my boyfriend please don't look too much 😂😂😂
34:23 Mama Dekunle's reaction here is so beautiful 😍
Sometimes you have to loose yourself to find the real you 😢
Nice movie
Very nice
The brothers casting is so perfect… they could pass as real siblings any day
First time seeing Chisom she is so pretty ❤
22:40 madam landlady say na shegiya😂🤣
Amazing storyline, very different from the usual Nollywood films. A lot of great singers in the film.🤩🤩🎥 👌🏾👌🏾🫡🫡 INSPIRING MOVIE 🎦
Ah  I didn’t see this coming  Wow  Thank you for this reality check ma 🙏🏾
Indeed, guys, this  movie is nice  Joshua is good singer I pray that any one who is struggling in life  Will  surely  make it, in jesus Amen May our dreams come true May God change our story if you believe Say Amen and it is done 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🥰🔥🔥🔥🔥💥
14:35 hahahaha he waited for 00:00hrs to sing happy birthday to someone who doesn't love him back. Oh Lord, see wetin love dey do o!
Omonioboli is the best
Yes Clinton deserves an award this year
Obvious that he wasn't the one singing 😂 Nevertheless good movie❤

I love this movie... Very interesting, u really tried my fav adekunle Clinton Joshua, mum adekunle tried as well, she played her role excellently. N shade as well, really played the role as well.. I love you guys, all of u played the role very well. Kudos to u all. This film has a lot of lessons.
Nobody is talking about the G guys. They played their role perfectly 🎉🎉
Mama please a movie featuring Michael Dappa and Clinton Joshua
Kenyans kiss 💋  my  comment  likes 👍 tukisonga
I came here because of MimiOnScreen and I do not regret watching this movie. Mimi played her role so well. I'm still wondering how I cried lol. Sade and Adekunle delivered. There's so much to learn from this movie honestly. Sometimes, challenges comes  to realign us back to purpose. If Adekunle never experienced all that happened to him, he probably would have losed his way, he'd have suffered from identity crisis as well. Everything he went through shaped him into purpose. I'm already typing too long. Sade reminds me of myself, a selfless and forgiving heart. @OmoniOboli is really good at what she does. I couldn't even tell the end of the movie from the beginning. The only thing I could tell was, Sade and Adekunle loving up. You all taught the movie was just going straight forward and thinking Adekunle would win the show in the beginning right?😅 now that's what I'm talking about... @Omonioboli Really kept us in suspense😊 Good job, ma'am.
We should learn to listen and  respect elders cz for them they see things  from  a distance and normally speaks with wisdom and at times with  experience, if this star boy listened to  his mother he wouldn't  have lost the money for competition cz he had won already  same applies to  his brother he ended in jail and left with  nothing cz of his love  for  quick money and luxurious life, A friend like Shady is every one that needs, that one person who can  stand for u in all  situations just that some of u take them for granted!
This is really a nice story line to learn from, kudos ma for putting all this together..... I could not stop crying when he missed the finale of the competition forgetting it was a movie.
All these movies with the same stale story line.
1:27:17 is my favourite part.
Remember to subscribe to the channel!!!!
This bayo of a guy sabi this yahoo work well well i give am hand ✋👌
Kudos to mommy, she did an excellent job!!!!
Great Storyline. Welldone Actors 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Wow this is actually nice ❤
I enjoyed every bit of this movie. So much to learn, it's a hope to those who feel like nothing good can come out of bad days. Better days ahead to those feel hopeless, depressed due to the pressures of life  and struggles 😊
Great movie.....needed for every generation...both old and new...thank you
This is so good ❤
❤❤❤
Omo shade really try oo 😢
❤❤❤❤❤
If no one is talking about it, I will nigga, WTF!!! What got me thrilled is the scam call Starboy's brother did with the white woman, that shit was fucking dope bro... And yeah it is an exciting movie

I felt so bad when Star boy didn’t win the competition but it was a good thing he didn’t give up on his dreams because of his past mistakes, btw Shade did a great job being his highest cheer leader and support system.   I honestly enjoyed every bit of this movie.  Big ups to the cast and crew 👏👏❤️🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Very brilliant and outstanding!! Bravo! Bravo!👍👍👍👍
And I belong to her ooooo
Adekunle should have listened to his mother to stay away from his brother.
Lovely movie well done guys ❤ I love this babe shade
I love how Shadae is straight forward with Kunle. She loves him but she won't allow him to take her for a fool by using her anyhow.🥰

This is a lesson to Parents. The children of the present need total complete and transparent information when correcting. Not speaking in coded language. The mother gave only limited half hearted to the younger brother. When you are trying to correct your children. Give them absolute fact. Stop hoarding information because you want to cover up. May we never regret our actions. Good story.
omo please clear road ohhh 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 ❤
This my best movie ever from omoni  oboli
Kudos to the crew members. You guys did and amazing job 👍🏼

I don’t usually comment after watching movies but this movie was really inspiring and so moving in several different ways, it was literally so relatable to the challenges & experiences we go through in life. It was so fascinating and sweet and passed on amazing messages. This combo is the best, their  acting is so entertaining and authentic. It felt so real…This was such a good movie, loved it!  Mrs. Oboli please keep them coming, this was so beautiful & amazing to watch❤❤👏

Money is love
I'm not a fan of Nigerian movies, but who had what she said there a living proof that something that is broken can still shine 😭😔 so what ever you are going through don't give up and stay positive keep hope alive is going to be fine.
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🔥♥️💋💋
Wow nice movie ❤❤❤❤❤
This movie is a lifetime lesson. Know yourself well before you let others in. And parents please let your children know the reasons why you are trying so hard to disconnect them from others. Thank you to all the crew members ❤❤❤❤.. You did a great job
Is omoni aware of this channel??
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
It's so disappointing to me that we are still looking for approval  for westerners , all the songs sung was none was from the continent
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏😘😘
What's that thing women talk about fight for us? As an man and an adult don't ever play such childish games. Don't fight for any woman thinks you have to beg for her love, walk away.
Thank you, Dear Jesus, for the gift of life upon us 🙏🙏🙌🙌 This movie is really great ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 Joshua Clinton, we need more 🤝❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👌👌👌

A man’s gift will pave way for him if he uses it right!
So I compared this great movie with Prophet suddenly 3. So I'll say... Amaka=Miokukusheshe😁 Bayo=The pastor from Kenya😏 Adekunle(Clinton)=Minister James😁 Mama Bayo=Minister Jame's church pastor✝️ Shade(Soso)=Vivian (minister James girlfriend). 😁😍  Thank you!😁 The movie bam👏
Awww it’s so good to see Our SoSo and Clinton Joshua here. Much ❤to them both 😊
This slaps you guys are giving this boy lately is unfair o….that was how he was slapped in the painful promise 😢
34:49 who else is curious about who wrote the song?
I love the movie ❤ the part that made it more funny is when CLINTON asked bayo what is the color of our gate and said is black that was really funny 😂🤣. Kudos team
I am impressed with the way this channel make they movies, the start of every scene explain the movie and the display the logo of the channel is top class, as a move editor myself i am impressed with that

I love❤ you Clinton Joshua❤❤
The funny thing is almost every man once had a "Shade" in their lives, but would stupidly be falling for "Amaka" who doesn’t always send them. It's funny how men think sometimes.
This movie gave me goose bumps especially the part where the song went viral and people were coming to take selfies with him
Finally its out😊
Lol this is donzazzy🎉😂
I love love ❤🎉
😊😊❤
THIS IS TOO GOOODDD!

This movie brought back memories of my family's suffering from 2012-2014😢 through it all, the Lord has been faithful and his mercies sufficient 🎉🎉🎉.
So so super! I enjoyed every bit of it🎉🎉🎉🎉
Wat a nice movie ❤ I'm happy seeing Clinton J & Soso  🥰❤️ Congrats on 1M views 🎉🎉
And please don't give up on people.  I like the character Shade played. She never gave up on her love for Adekunle even when there was no hope of getting that love back
A good watch!!!❤
God this movie is a lesson.  So Clinton Joshua fit speak Yoruba
Story line is very deep. Raising boys in this day and age as a single mother is very draining and very difficult. We need families to support widows, not necessarily funds, but serve us life coach or mentor for the boys when they get into their teens.
Please who the real singer
Manage iPhone 15 for now? Amaka well done.
This moving is driving me crazy
Okay, I have to comment on this movie. This movie is so relatable and i enjoy every bit of it. I cried, i laughed and was optimistic.  There's hope for those who haven't given up.  Thank you Omoni Oboli.❤
No matter how life promises u dont change who u really are to make pppe happy,ds movie shows really life  Clinton ur always mi best actor ❤❤❤❤
Kunle has finally gotten to meet Rema & others mavins records 😂😂
Just like Dekunle, one day, kings and queens shall come to the rising of our children in Jesus' name, Amen
The movie storyline is telling us about Adekunle Gold journey in the music industry
The land lady looks and talks like Vicky James
At a point I was agree but at the end I love you baby
Promise them a lambo🤣🤣
Josh the choir master, go fine choir join no bcs u get tham.
Soso and Clinton 🔥🔥♥️
Nice movie ❤❤
Nice
This movie is sooo emotional and educative cheers to @Omoni Oboli thank you mama for this great film
Be with a woman that loves you, not otherwise.
So interesting the movie touch heart so amazing ❤
This is a very good movie  Clinton always deliver his role It’s teach us everything abt life and struggles 😢 God bless d producer and the cast 🙏
Kunle:What’s the Color of our gate Bayo?? Bayo:Is black  Kunle:Is black, Is black Bayo😂😂😂  Clinton won’t kill me😂😂 Is actings are always topnotch👍
This movie is phenomenal
I understand that D’s mum didn’t want to paint a bad picture of Bayo in his eyes but I believe that it was the genesis of this whole problem because if she had been honest with him then he’d have known exactly who he was dealing with. The only thing he wanted to do was bond with his big brother and that is completely normal. Yes, he could have been more discerning but a little help from his mother would have made a difference. She should have explained to D why Bayo left in the first place.  But we thank God for second chances.  Also, there’s strength in adversity. Sometimes you have to go through pain to discover the real you. Authenticity really is the key to breakthrough.
But sade is so beautiful
From the Story To lesson leant To actors and actresses To the tracks omg♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️😅♥️♥️😅♥️😅♥️😅♥️👋😅♥️😅♥️😅♥️😅♥️😅👋👋😅👋😅♥️😅♥️😅👋😅👋😅♥️♥️😅♥️😅♥️😅♥️✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨ OMONI OBOLI I can't get enough she is just took Good

Clinton Joshua is a pure talent
Who realised that CJ is very comfortable with SOSO
"When reality hits your dreams..." These scripts aren't just entertainment, they are real life stories. And this one is for pure creatives. Those really looking to be out there and all they have isn't just their certificate in their drawer, but the dreams in their hearts, the creativity that they've been honing all their lives. Thank you Mama for this one. I am grateful for it.  To all those who brought the script to life, thank you.🥰🥰🥰 Clinton speaking yoruba, the yoruba small talks here and there? Perfect😂😂 And Soso's realness? It sure doesn't feel like acting🥰🥰🤭
❤❤❤
I am a dreamer🥹

Story of my life😢😢😢🇿🇲
Story of my life😢😢😢🇿🇲
Stellar cast. The mother stole my heart! Such phenomenal acting. I wish we heard more about what the eldest son tried to do to her. It was glazed over. She also encouraged Star Boy to just forgive his brother when she couldn’t even do the same for YEARS😂
❤❤❤❤❤
How much can you feel that Bayo’s intentions were genuine ❤😢😢 this is love for the hood❤❤️‍🩹🩸
Omo big bro is inside this innocent boy already 🤭🤭🤭
Mummies are actually this observant about girls around their boys❤️🤩
i think mammy was right that big bro should stay away🌝
This movie deserves an award omoni oboli. You did a great job. God bless you ❤
I like..... ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
That feeling  when men supporting men 🩸🩸

What is the colour of our gate bayo It's black😂😂😂😂
He literally had the opportunity to take the money from his brother and refund Sade, instead he was giving her some cheap “thank you” speech continuously. Instead he was buying iPhone 15 for gold digger Bae😂  Oga! You have the money now, refunding me won’t be a bad idea.
Soso and Clinton forever ❤😘😘😘
Soso, you're so beautiful 😍
Soso did a great job 🎉 Kudos to all the cast and crew. It was an inspiring movie 👏👏👏
Wow Joshua you really nailed this one very entertaining much love
Let me finally get to watch Clinton Joshua and see how this movie unfolds .let's go grab popcorn 🍿 and ready to enjoy Omoni Oboli storyline.This girl Amaka is greedy .Clinton leave her and let she be,She will run back when you make it in life.What a generation the world come to .no money,no love.so sad.

Na Clinton get that voice
You all killed it 👍beautiful storyline 👏 ❤
This movie right here deserves 100 million views, an AMVC awards and all  other accolades available. Where do I even start? Clinton, Soso, Daniel, Mama Bayo and the rest of the cast, you’all did great. Mama Omoni Oboli, thank you immensely for always bringing out not only touching stories in your movies, but you make sure these stories inspire your audience. Thank you and your team and may God Almighty continue inspiring you to produce great movies 🎥. Much love from Cameroon 🇨🇲
Wooow this movie is so relatable. It was also a huge source of encouragement for me. I really needed this tonight particularly. One missed opportunty isn’t the end. Things would get better eventually by God’s grace. Just keep praying, following his directive and be diligent with what he has told you to do
You're looking too much and shiny your teeth 😂😂
I  see  the mother  was  right  about  her  older son  sometimes.  a mother  knows watching from the United States
My 🌟 boy Clinton
❤❤❤❤❤❤
✨🎉❤
Give it up to singer 08 ❤❤❤ Olajumoke sings is very good
❤❤❤❤
Be like say una Donjazy voice na from temu 😂
I'm confused,  are there two Omoni Oboli channels now?
Soso will not kill mi 😂 u look too much n shining your teeth
Gracias 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I  hope  when  Clinton  gets  money  he don't   let that  girl    use  him, because she  wants  his  money watching from the United States
This movie reminds me of Proverbs 5.
Sometimes saying the truth to break a heart is better than keeping it to destroy a dream or life..❤ the mum should ve told him the truth or what she knew..
This movie is so amazing. Interesting, engaging and educative 🔥🔥🔥🔥
The miming was perfect, and the combo of the last music and the video was epic, made it emotional
I like the way GBOROSKI acted in this movie.
Always mothers wish the bestie to their children but children don't understand  His success was distracted some times we need to be and stand on our own But its only God's timing and being patient not running things improprietly😢 Much love from Uganda 🇺🇬 the pearl of Africa 🌍
Go Clinton, we love you
Bro is fat, he looks better slim and normal, the chick no fit am ohh
I'm sorry.... 1:55:20... that's what I'm talking about. Details matter
I enjoyed the movie but the ending wasn't nice, they should have shown us that she went for the modeling pageant won the crown, and also Clinton should have shown more appreciation for what she did for him, in his speech he should have praised her a lot and let the world no her and also show that true love really exist
It was fun while it lasted clint
Wow this is so interesting movie with lots of lessons and emotions.You did a great job I celebrate you 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Ma'am you just keep raising the bar, well done to the cast and crew.
My favorite ❤
All men  and  women should  know  their worth and don't  just settle  watching from the United States

Thr moment she paid for his mom's bill he won his heart❤
What an elderly person sees while lying down, a young person can never see it even if they climb an iroko tree. Dekunle messed it up 1:48:25
Omo bayo cute sha

Omo the movie sweet
From "Treasure in the Sky" I haven't skipped any movie ❤❤.
Is this movie about Adekunle Gold..?
Guys the song is called crushing the status quo by exouxia Wilson. It’s a nice song
❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I recommend this movie to you; it's one of the best films by Clinton that I have ever seen. The song at the end is simply beautiful, I had tears! A big thought to all those people who go through this kind of situation; may God be with you.
Why would you tell your younger son to stay away from the eldest one without explaining to him the reason why. Tell him the reason you don't want him close to his own blood brother for Christ sake
Love this movie ooooo❤😂🎉
I pray against any almost near Goodnews
SO SO add comedy inside this film 😂😂😂😂
This movie is beautiful.. I pray it takes Clinton career to the next level!! Cinema, Netflix and all good 😊
Starr boy 😊😊
I love this song "Hello sade" I have cried so much !! this movie is very famous Clinton and Soso are a best actor !🥲
Na Clinton get sweet mouth pass
Oh mine, see voice ❤❤❤🎉 28:45
This is an interesting movie!!! Kudos to the cast and crew.   It doesn't matter the heights don't ever change against your friends but if it's other way, be discipline with it.   Lesson learned :- Let's learn how to forgive ourselves and your friends, and move on in life so that no one will be in bondage. Forgiveness &  Restitution is good and let's learn to be contended. if you have a good friend, hold them very well and reciprocate the friendship. If you are in a relationship or in friendship zone, let's learn how to forgive and forget.    We are winners, congratulations guys 🎉 if you need a buddy, we can connect 🎉. Love & Lights 🎉🙏🥂
My godness it's a banger period!!
My role model 🫂💯 My star boy  My crush  I love your movies so much  You are perfect    You were born for it my love      in what you do?
Poverty is a curse 😢😢😢 23:37

Nobody should look at My crush  too much, Clinton I love you so much ❤❤
So happy to see Clinton Joshua on ominous on oboli channel
This is the best movie ever ,l love  Josh  so much
This film has made me to understand Clinton better. About whom he is, and the choices he had to make, like self control, focusing on your dreams and not what comes with the fake fame. Also being yourself and not compromise and break your rules for fame and glam.
Clinton  very good actor❤❤
I didn't know CJ could sing  Was it his real voice???
This Clinton's brother is super cute🥰 my goodness!!!!! Their brother combination is super dope🔥🔥🔥🤭

Parent, please explain to your kids let they understand where you’re coming from. Don’t just tell them things and 2:30  don’t explain why you don’t want them to do the things you could save your young son from the same mistake your older son he is still young telling him to stay away from his older brother that just don’t help explain sit him down and telling him the reason  let him know where you’re coming from. You could’ve saved him from the same mistake if you are just explained the reason why you didn’t want him around your older son.

Encouraged by his loyal friend Sade, he enters a national singing competition that changes his life. As his fame rises, Dekunle must navigate fame, family secrets, and temptation — especially when his estranged brother Bayo resurfaces with ties to a dangerous criminal world.

"You will marry your husband " line touched me. I dated my husband and married my boyfriend it's painful. 40:41 go bro  Dekunle may the Lord God be with you go bring the money we need it more than ever. Believe and hope for success in Jesus name I pray 🙏. God bless you Shadie for saving our  mommy. Everyone needs a Shadie in his/her life.
There are so many wonderful details about this beautiful movie I can talk about but I just want to appreciate the writer for using traditional names for all the characters. We have so many tribes in Nigeria and I always find it sad when we use majorly English names in our movies. I want to watch movies and traditional names from all regions of the country
I think e don teach the time when Clinton go start kissing
😂o fine goh o set goh 😊
It's rare to find Shade in this time
Don jazzy????😂😂

Walaaaaahi the casts in here did majic. The story line and everything. A different side from clinton and im loving it. he cooked his role especially when the police came to their appartment
2:00:40 don't look too much 😂😂😂... Proud girlfriend moments 😂.. Little things that excites us
Life feels better after a lesson learnt 🎉❤
No matter what happens  to you in life always remember  that’s a second chance ❤❤
Nice and cool...work well done CJ ❤🎉and Soso
What's that 1:19 :9😂😂
1:59:00 Make Don Jazzy call me too nau 😩😂 God abeg
This is Don zazy o😂😂😂😂, nice one
This movie is a must watch wooow it’s so interesting 😊
I love this movie, it's one of the best movie of clinton so far and thank u omoniboli drama tv for bringing to us this interesting and exciting movie
❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wow what an amazing movie 🎥 i really need more and more of this 🎉🎉🎉❤
That’s not he’s real  voice jhoor 😂
♥♥
1:33:45 What's the colour of our gate?? 😂😂😂 It's black Bayo, you're doing yahoo...  Was that in the script or improvised? 😂
I love this movie so much just watched it finish now so interesting and loving more love to you Clinton Joshua ❤️‍🩹 and soso 🎉
1:27:36 I love Shade for this scene.
I started this movie yesterday; had to stop 5mins into it after checking the number of subscribers and noticed that it is wey smaller than the main Omoni Oboli channel because I thought someone else created this channel just to deceive people.   Like I had to go back to the other channel to search for the same movie before I saw a post from Omoni telling us to watch the movie in this channel 😂.   See me here 😂🎉, I’m bacccckkk.
Great cast, emotional and intriguing movie highly recommended for everyone. It seems Clinton Joshua acted this movie with his girlfriend 🇸🇯🇧🇻
1:22:22 😩😩😩 Who dey advice our star boy??  This just reflects what's going on in our society. Wanting to go along with trend, to belong... God help us
Make somebody find me the person wey wear that blue shirt and “trosis” for star boy abeg..😂   That aside, I love this movie. Greed is a force, it sucks you in and overtakes you. Patience is truly a virtue and sometimes all that glitters isn’t gold. Lastly, evil communication corrupts, choose your associates wisely.   It’s amazing to watch Clinton grow with each movie. Well done everyone involved in this project. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

Clinton my best actor,he fits every role,even speaking of Yoruba is good
I love u both Clinton and soso
Please there’s this movie I being seeing featuring Clinton and soso. If I am not mistaken. In the movie Soso is acting as a barber. Date of releasing 😅😅😅
This movie gives me goosebumps🥹❤️
I too love Daniel Rocky abeg😂😂😂
1:07:47 But if you ask me o, star boy was too focused on money to see through his mother's words. Yes, the mother shares the blame for not having that difficult conversation but... If my mother whom I've lived with tells me someones hand is not clean and asks me to LEAVE HER HOUSE if I don't align with her, omo.. I will think twice, ask questions and watch my steps. This is a brother you just reconnected with, you just found out your mother asked to stay away... I have alot to say but then... Star boy didn't do his due diligence as well.   1:12:14 look the kin advice he's giving you, contrary to the value you once had.  Most young people are like this and it pains me.
Clinton joshua is also my new addition ❤❤❤❤just love you son❤❤❤❤
This is so good  I’m not gonna lie 🫶
Poor Adekunle 😢 18:40 😢  The birthday message that he sent to his girlfriend  at 14:50 got me 🥺.Awww😢a friend like Shade 😢41:01 😢.....Am in awe😩😩😩😩, I have smiled,laughed, cried, indeed sometimes you have to lose yourself to find you🥺. A master piece full of lessons. There's no short cut to success. A big shout out to the whole cast❤❤❤.Take yo flowers 🌹🌹🌹🌹aunti OMONI
this pairing is the best. their chemistry is beautiful
Can we hit 500k already guys pls
Mama Ayo is too good abeg, immediately I saw someone rolling on the floor, I didn't see the face, I said it's Mama Ayo😊
ITS LANDORD FOR ME 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Everyone here did so beautifully 👏👏 Clinton’s real singing voice ❤❤❤ soso star gurllllll and Daniel rocky oohhh he did a super amazing job especially with the accent 😅🎉🎉🎉🎉 let’s not forget mama adesanya , a queen I Stan  Premium always with OMONEY
His mum was wrong for not being open with Adekunle and letting him get involved with Bayo's fraudulent lifestyle. This is one of the major problems with some parents. Any time people cover up things, it harms the people around them.
Hi, Clinton you’re actually a star boy. I love that. Kudos to you and soso ❤❤. To the producer 🎉🎉🎉.
Am here for Clinton Joshua 🌹🌹🎉🎉❤
Raising kids these days is so stressful
51:19 Ahhh... Yahoo yahoo 😩  All these fraudsters
Am I the only one that has noticed that Clinton doesn’t kiss in movies?
Wow nice video 🎉❤I'm in love with ❤🎉 the video
Great movie, great message..
SHOULD HAve chosen a better voice for star boy Ezelewe the singing voice lacked aBIT
Ahh Adekunle, "I'm just a boy" keh😂😂🤣
I don't know how many times I will watch  this movie to be satisfied I keep coming to watch it over and over again 😂😂❤
Adekunle mother said " Shegiya you too".
The guy and his mom can’t pay rent but he’s walking around with AirPod Max. 😂
Clinton is so good. Damn
Clinton Joshua am your big fan  Love you soooo much ❤️💕
Am literally crying 😭😭
Very interesting movie to watch now
Um
I really love how innocent and decent they kept the love between Shade and Adekunle. Well done script writer for not adding unnecessary explicit scenes.
Soso is an amazing actress I love her. She's soooo original and natural... It's not forced. Well done Girly
Sighs" and i also found love innit 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Ahhhh i gats use dis line in life one dayyyyyyy😅😅😅
What's the colour of our gate ,😂😂😂😂u almost killed me .
One of the best real-life dramas I’ve ever watched❤️ Omoni Oboli, this is not just an ordinary movie—it’s powerful🔥...I believe it has the potential to inspire someone who has given up on life to find hope again🙏 As usual representing Malawi here❤🇲🇼🇲🇼🇲🇼🇲🇼
31:20 No be small you dey craze 😂😂😂 Change am for him 😂
Clinton my favorite ❤️
This movie supposse reach 2m before now 🥰beautiful movie and interesting movie🥰🥰
When i grow up i want to b like the landlady😂😂😂she is very stupid 😂😂😂

God pls bless me with a Friend like Sade and also help me be like her❤🙏 Lovely movie, much luv from Cameroon ❤❤🎉
If you're looking for a masterpiece, this is it right here. Lovely casts, lovely acting.
🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
Shade's kind of beauty is unique. She is uncommonly stunning.  It takes one who can identify real beauty to see it. She is beautiful and apt in acting.  Well done to Bayo, Sis Ronke and all the casts. You are all amazing. ❤🎉😊😊
This is a cinema movie o Never a doll moment with soso CJ acting is amasing he always delivers Cuddles to all d actors and actresses, producers,script writers great job I learnt alot from dis movie
❤
CJ OR NO OTHER
Subtitles please
If you really want to enjoy this movie watch for the second time, I dnt get tired of watching it
Clinton u are good ,
Nice movie ❤ Lesson learnt
U are the best Star boy ❤❤❤❤❤
Bestie ❤Weldon, these actors brought their a game
Wow I love Clinton Joshua ❤❤❤❤
The mother also was at fault, she would have explained to him and that would have made him more careful.  You can't tell a sibling not to associate with their other sibling without a valid reason,  especially when u know ur son is at one of his most vulnerable state and desperate in a good way though
Weldon to the the cast and crew
Weldon to the the cast and crew
The movie is too good i love it 💋
Darm, this was an intense one. Omoni did not play when she said Drama TV. 10 out of 10
Guy u 2 much i want more of u❤❤❤😅😅😅🎉🎉🎉.
Make Una check marvin record Don jazzy don sign Clinton 😂
Who agrees with me that the scandals also contributed in him going more viral asides the music talent.. you know how PR works whether negative or positive.. but he's lucky everything turned around positively for him cos not everyone gets this lucky... This was a good watch 🎉,  Clinton is such a talented actor 👏   Weldone guys ❤
If you really love Clinton Joshua❤❤❤ and you're a true fans like this comment

Only ONE OMONI OBOLI… the writers need a hug from me
Parents; you can't tell a grown-up man not to associate with his/ her long lost sibling when they find them without giving them that Hard Explanation you think you are shielding them from or they will get  it the Hard/ wrong way. Mama  Adekunle , you could  have  saved his dream if u had just told him who Bayo really was... and not be closed mouthed about it.
Okay am going to be honest. These two don't have  chemistry...
Sade put your head one place make the stylist comb am well, we no say na you them sing the song for 😂
So Clint can sing? Wow wow, cute voice❤❤❤
Thumbs up for ayo adesanya, she acted her role so well!  It felt so real. In short thumbs up to everyone involved.

I know it’s hard and much work and effort is required but Clinton Joshua abeg make u consider series with lots of seasons and episodes… i want to be watching u every day 😩❤️… i literally exhaust your movies in hours and wait like there are no other movies to watch 😞
To be honest, i had to comment  This is the best movie have ever seen Like the movie is so filled with emotions and it is inspiring  Let’s not forget about the crew and producers… Kuddos to you all 👏 👏  The movie is amazing  And the lessons learnt is super nice  Thanks to Omoni Oboli Drama TV ❤ We really appreciate ma’am To all the actors and actresses, you guys did amazingly well  The movies taught us what true love means, taught us about life, about poverty, about fame, about money, about how to live when you get to the top It’s a great movie  Thanks for this wonderful movie ma’am ❤🙏🙏 To my favs clinton joshua and soso, I love you both so much Hope you guys will see this comment  Greater heights to every one of you ijn As you read through all the comments, i hope you will be inspired to produce more movies as you inspired us with this movie

This movie was quit different, the movie was so interesting and also emotional
Nice movie with good moral lesson
This is the best storyline ever, any Ugandan 🇧🇪 here thumbs up to the  amazing movie and all the crew
This is a good one 😊
OO the Banger maker❤ another master piece🎉
I'm here for CJ ❤
Guys was it worth the wait?
The part where he say ah bayo u Dey do yahoo is sooo funny 😂😹😹😹
How can.you ask a full grown adult to stay away from his brother without giving him details. He is no longer a kid forghusake😢
Omo, I'm mind blown like something different in all. This movie is worth every second I used to watch it. Is it from Clinton improved Yoruba or Soso that captivated us with her beauty and the entire casts who interpreted their role especially Bayo when he said"Mama Bayo" has his password 😅. Overall a lot of lessons was learnt from this movie; To be focused, Do not forget your root and those who supported you and so on. A big Thank u to the Production team and story writer ❤.
But why she open another channel, what happen to the other one???
Y DE cry Kule your mum warned you what dd you do,got for it 😢😢😢😢RSA
Waoooooo such a nicely movie. I ❤ it.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is not Clinton Joshua singing I swear, 😂
Beautiful movie and even more beautiful music ❤❤
How dis guy take hear our language
This is such a beautiful movie!!! this pair is always a delight to watch, Adekunle's brother was my favourite character, he nailed his role effortlessly(amazing!).  This movie has so many lessons; it teaches loyalty, virtue, determination and more. What really hits home for me was how he chased his dream as a songwriter and singer, I just turned 30 and have never done anything about my song writing and singing skills (something I know is my God's given talent).  May God continue to strengthen all those chasing their dreams until they get their breakthrough.
omoni oboli you're the baddest 😅 always giving us the unexpected 😊 great job guys 😁
Even the Mummy said purrrrrr
Aunty Omoni made me wait for a week  About to begin 🥰
Clinton Joshua is rocking in this film, So refreshing!!! Still want you to start kissing though 😊 “You gat this!!!
Beautiful masterpiece
7:05 touching
❤❤❤❤❤🎉
Dis your X will bury you alve n wl lve you again when she finishiz you, you go run back to a fyn gel Soso😢😢😢😢RSA
I love the Yoruba part 10:27
Let's be realistic that song on the ending part hits different 🔥🔥🔥 thumbs up to Clinton and soso
1st bad luck for you Kule is your X b4 your brada destroys you,now you got moni you 4get Shady Who Was always de even payd your moda's bills😢😢😢😢RSA
A very touching story❤, I literally cried while watching it 😢 Also I learnt a lot from it, no matter how long it might be, joy is definitely coming at the end of it all😩🙏
Excellent movie great story great actors. The director did a great job at least no trying to kiss and hiding face. I love it, it doesn’t even look like lip syncing
Kule you dont know your brada de way your mum Kno ,I feel you will loose evrnthng you hv wrkd for coz of your brada😢😢😢😢RSA
Seriously it not funny anymore I don't like d way  clinton joshua no dey kiss for movie  It's not making sense again Haba From now on I will stop watching he movies It so annoying
Best movie ever
I'm just a boy
Abeg who Dey teach Clinton Yoruba 😅😢self the person really try oo 😅well kudus to the cast most especially my crush CLINTON JOSHUA ❤🎉
The one u re dating that is not dating u 😂😂 😭
Actually I don't know what to say this movie has left me speechless less . I don't know how to describe it. But  all thanks to mama omoni and am sure you created this with all your heart. This is beyond measure. You really poured your heart. Thanks to Clinton and soso for acting well. This is a life lesson. Know what you want. A mother is someone who wishes the best thing for her child. A brother can let you down but a mother is always there. There are some good partners out there who always support and God is always there so don't  blame God on anything . He has a plan for you. Life is about ups and downs.
I love the  movie so much, so interesting, specially the music part it melt my heart ❤️, great  job clinton 🎉

It's time film makers starts putting effort.  Nice story line but definitely not believable, It never looked like Kunle was singing at all. Why not get someone to sing and let him do a lip sync or something. Na wa oo
Shady is so beautiful
Awww awwww so interesting and heart touching 😢❤
Awww awwww so interesting and heart touching 😢❤
Star boy is a great movie that supposed to be in the cinema or Netflix,thanks to the producers ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Josh!!!!!!!!!!!hmmmm you're ma fev actor i celebrate you.
How does it make sense for the mother to hide everything about Bayo to Kunle and still ask him to keep away? These are brothers and its impossible to tell siblings to stay away from each other. The mum should have told Kunle everything so that he can be careful with his brother. But even with everything the brother is doing, you cant tell brothers to keep away from each other. Kunle would have understood if the mum had told him and he would have Kept his distance too but just telling him to stay away without a reason is strange... What if Bayo had used his brother for ritual?
You don’t have to let anyone steal your peace because they cannot find their own .
This one pass movie The part this boy dey sing Soso don marry am already got her head
Am l the only one who repeat that fast singing pt for more than two times 😊😊❤
Nice movie👏
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Nice movie.... May we never die young in Jesus Name!
Bayo may be bad in his own way... But certainly a good brother
Surprise for you now! Be surprised! Ah! 😂
My Clinton  and  Soso More Love ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Please can I have a name of the song
Please let give this movie  three melon v ❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤
Any Ugandan here just because of Joshua Clinton ❤
Jamaica 🇯🇲 🇯🇲 🇯🇲  here watching
First time commenting here, sincerely it's a best movie ever, clinton u are a genius 🤩😍🤩
am here for clinton Joshua❤
He is my favorite actor l am from Zambia🇿🇲🇿🇲
Fear my gender oo😅😅 i go lie for you
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
When you read others comment my is even small ,
Aww he also had a scholarship but look at his life , hm this movie is very emotional
How come they installed CCTV in his rooms with his knowledge , who did that and how where they able to get through it without his notices , someone very close to him might be the victim , that is the answer
Evil doesn’t announce itself with drums.!!
Innocent soul life ,just imagine you are abusing an innocent soul , if you don't love him let go , it's like a slavery something
It was a trap the CCTV in the house , just imagine you can't have you own privacy in life just imagine , your sex life  is like a movie to the hole world , why it's human right abuse no one is the right to abuse your sex life of privacy , why is it a game or what , how can your sex life be a public out cast , this why his not dating I see now
Clinton my favorite actor ❤️❤️❤️❤️
😂😂 😂 I knew the person  that would reach out will be Don jazzy
She is the love for him but scared to show it up ,
She is an angel and more than the villain in the movie , aww so touching , pretty and sexy
That slap enter @1:07:09🫣😂
The faulty is coming from the lady he left and disgrace him when he was broke , this shows clear that she came back because of money , if I where to be the guy I chose the pos lady she is the right one for her she was there for him when he was impoverished and put of hope, her type of caliber is ineffable and inimitable to find this days , this are the type of ladies we want to date and build the future with , not  gold diggers ,
❤🎉there combination is everything ❤
Mama don drop again ❤❤
CCTV in all the rooms just  imagine ,
Let give it up for shade our girlfriend🥰🥰the chemistry between soso and cliton is so sweet,we all need a friend that can motivate us to be a better vasion,cudos to the entire cast and crew and of cause our greatest producer❤❤,it was wort the wait after staving us last week😂😂😂
Star boy is my favorite Actor 🎉🎉🎉🎉
This is the most inspiring and relatable movie(by Omoni) that I've ever watched
👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
This movie has so much depth,decided to see the movie while sewing through the night and it just left me in tears because sometimes it seems like it's never going to get better but this movie just lifted my spirit,thank you bestie ❤
Lesson learnt: Don't be distracted on your way to success.
Sharp, sharp, sharp. 💯
I'm a 'Star Girl' at 54!  I am good enough.  God said as much.  In Jesus's Name.  5.22.25
I love you soso ❤🎉
This to me, is different and in a mind blowing way. There is something about Clinton Joshua in movies, else why will i be up this late glued to a movie, laughing, crying, and also seeing a part of me played out in the movie. its also a plus that it was not centered on the usual love story, but so much to learn from. I am glad for the gift of this movie, i learnt that being poor does not last forever and be careful the decisions you make, so your situation, does not get worse than it was, there is also dignity in labour and in the long run, it will all pay off. long epistle lol, thank you to the cast and crew, good job guys.More from Clinton Joshua please
Great Movie and fantastic Cast. 🎉🎉🎉🎉 💯
Woow this is one of the best movie I've ever watched, So educating So emotional So so evrytin. I give this movie 1000/1000 minus nothing.  Clinton Joshua continue making us proud everyday Soso for Sofia, Great talented actress with natural vibe.
OMG this movie was so freaking amazing 💚💚🥰🥰🔥🔥!!!! Clinton Joshua you're the best at what you do. I'm addicted to every movie you've ever been in and I'll forever be a huge fan.

Please share, best in a long time, ❤️🥰💕
Golden script and execution ❤❤❤
Didn't realise Clinton Joshua could fluently speak Yoruba o, wow! Also, the story line was on point and it obviously deserves million views in days just like Love in every word! kudos to you Omoni for bringing out the untapped potential from Clinton and the rest, kudos to you for a perfect job well done!
Nice nice ❤❤❤❤ enjoyed it
& how come no1's talking about this Bayo character???? A big fat huge scammer... & Daniel Rock really nailed that! 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
But Soso is such a vibe and a beauty. Loved her the very first time I saw her in the other movie with Clinton, the one where she worked at her father's garage. There's a special chemistry between these two ❤❤
This was an amazing piece and I love every bit of this movie 😊
dis is a cinema movie right here......love it❤❤❤

Moral lessons.... Never get carried away,is very unfortunate we the youth of today just wants to make it fast fast without following the due process and that's why we keep losing it. I PRAY GOD ALMIGHTY GUIDE US AND PROTECT US FROM THE THINGS  THAT WILL DESTROY US IN JESUS NAME AMEN 🙏🏿.  WELDONE TO ALL THE CREW MEMBERS I LOVE EVERY BIT OF IT.💯👌
This is movie 😂❤
This is a very beautiful story....weldone Aunty Omoni, manage these flowers🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
There is something really special with your movies! You’ve made me love African movies! God bless your works!
This Don Jazzy is not jazzying o mama oboli 😂
This Soso is a very pretty girl
Amazing 🎉❤😂
I loved how solid and extraordinary mama was encouraging and covering Kunle in a mother’s love and a way that only mama can. Mama didn’t coddle Kunle bc there is a difference between covering a man and coddling a man. We do our sons no favors babying them. Mama gave things to Kunle straight no chasers and in total love. The lessons were so crystal clear to never give up or let go of your dreams. Keep going, don’t stop believing and never let fame or someone to negatively influence you to the point that it gives you an illusion of grandeur and a false sense of invincibility. No one is immune from all things falling apart. Kunle and Sade were so good together. Love the bond they had . In reality celebrities need real and wholesome people around them like Mama and Sade that will love and tell them the truth to help keep them centered and anchored in reality. Star ⭐ Boy is a really fine production. Clinton, Soso, Danny, Mama Ayo and entire staff W/D ❤❤🎉
Shade too fine... Wife material❤❤❤ That Don jazzy studio for just show small😊😊😊
First time Clinton Joshua says Yoruba 😂😂😂😂

Clinton Joshua be like Ronaldo for football, everywhere he goes people follow him
This movie opened up a wound, i was scammed using this technique, may thunder fire them.  And yoh, i’m gonna reserve my comments about clinton, cause i’m a wife(this weapon shall not prosper). The movie was 10/10 as expected but i couldnt help but notice minor flaws eg the hospital theater not looking like a hospital theater, the HR delivering sad news smilling
Now I can Subscribe to my momma’s new YouTube channel not after watching this amazing Interesting mind blowing movie cos what 😮? I love love love 💕😍 it definitely 💯 worth my time…. Mama you too good for this industry abeg 😇 all your movies are super amazing, thanks for giving us this great one and I can’t wait for more love you 🥰 my beautiful mama.

This is a great and a beautiful movie 🎥, I enjoy every minute of it , I so much love it ❤❤❤❤ everyone delivered their roles so well and for our super Star ✨⭐ Clinton and soso, please take your flowers 🌹🌹🌺🌺
I really love the song❤😊
My STAR BOY 🥹 — that last part of ‘Singing Shade’ had me all teary.🥹@clintonjoshua❤️  But I give 100 stars ✨ to the story writer 📑 you did well
This!!!! Words can't even compare to the feeling I got while watching this drama.   Omoni Oboli and crew keep it up!  This is truly a worthy  ode for those who dream despite life's cruel hand.   It's okay to dream, but what isn't okay is for those dreams to never see the light of day.
Your company could make or mar you, be careful ❤
Eeish title alone ❤
This movie is going to blow just like love in every word ❤wow  So exceptional
O.O. this is LIFE spelt in one sentence oooo. There is a song in Ghana that says; ''you get double of what you've lost.'' And i've seen it in this movie. God bless you bountifully and continuously too. This CJ and SOSO's combo is A MUST WATCH. ❤❤❤❤❤💯✅
I love the status quo song who sang it Ahbeg? 🙏
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Incredible performance by the cast, especially Daniel Rocky. Definitely will go far 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 Watching from 🇺🇸 🇺🇸

I love ittttttttt!!!! 🥰🥰🥰
Star boy 🌟 wizkid 😂😅
So everybody knows how to insult in Hausa 😂😂😂she said SHEGIYA 😂😂😂😂
Never allow a person to tell you more than once you are not good enough. If the relationship is only based on your ability to finance extravagant vacations, restaurants, food, purchases, wigs, makeup, cars, nails, and etc. that is not love.  I can guarantee the person is not able to provide any of these things for herself, yet they look for support from others.
This movie has the character of sprinter...(Akeem) and his elder brother who tries to support his dream in running
Thumbs up to Sade too. D girl is so natural n beautiful.
48:00. Soso is so wise 🎉
THIS BROTHER IS A BAD INFLUENCE  CLINTON RUNNN
Very nice movie. Clinton dey speak Yoruba .....good one good one👍
The casting in this movie is outta this world! Beautiful piece of art!!!🫡🔥🔥🔥
AND THE DRAMA BEGINS PROMAX PHONE
Kudos my favorites❤ Clinton and our SOSO❤❤❤
A woman’s love you should never be based on how much you able to provide for her financially. If or when you find out that her love is only because of what you’re able to give her, you no should no longer need her.
In this generation. People like Shade are rare. Because men no longer vakue the real but the superficial. God bless her heart. Great job Clinton
God this movie seems so real 😮😮😮😮
Our daddy001 doing what he knows best😍😍😍 you are indeed a star boy
My Virdict ...  Great lessons,Great Come Back ..  Overall Movie Rate: Very Good ❤🎉

Very impressive  ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Lovely
Omoni oboli thank you for giving us premium movies here on YouTube. This movie was spectacular and deserves millions of views. Soso and Clinton are my favorite pair so far. You can see he’s not uptight with her.  I have watched every single movie on your channel from the one who stole my heart to star boy. Please never reduce your standard our baddest producer!
Omoni Oboli you are wicked ,this movie is a roller coaster of emotions ,never seen a movie like this ,gosh take your flowers 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
This movie is so inspiring😊 Even when you make mistakes, take up the pieces and continue.  As far it’s real and authentic it will thrive😊  FIND YOURSELF  Definitely learnt a lot
Clinton has mastered the art of less is more in the romance and intimacy space. He has turned intimate, honest, and authentic conversational dialogue into an art form. His characters just get the assignment in understanding how to handle women and treat them with love and care. Showing vulnerability with a gentle word of comfort and being a fixer and protector has become his signature. If you admire and are a fan of his work can we get some love for the one and only Clinton Joshua ❤❤✨✨👌🎉🎉❤❤
2:01:53  This song jxt hits differently ❤❤ A reminder that dreams do come true .
It's black 🖤🖤🖤😂😂
Something very small, maybe like iphone15 hahaha  I thought she was doneeee lol  She added PRO
Soso is a great actress more of her please mama ❤ she killed her role ❤
So so lovely movie I love it  Well done 👍✅
Wow 😲
It's actually a surprise the way numbers are changing on the views record like it's not late yet but anyways I love the turn out❤🎉

Very nice movie wooooooooooooow
How can you expect  your child to stay away from something that is bad, and you refuse to speak up? Until  the very last min, when it possibly  to late. 😮❤
Netflix standard, Netflix worthy 👌
Me wey no like Dey fight 😂😂😂😂😂 AMAKA say you didn’t fight for us lol
Soso is a really good actress and I love the way she carries herself with all the different characters she's played so far but can we talk about how cute she is. Soso's natural beauty, personality, and sense of humor is top notch. She’s look’s really nice in wigs but I love when she wears braids or her hair in a neat lil 🍩 doughnut. Soso reminds you of a little sister that has you wrapped around her finger and you would do anything in the world for 🤎💕💕🤎
God send my own Shade ooooo,,I need it right now 😢😢
Clinton is so funny😂😂The police are in front of a black gate bayor  What’s the color of our gate  Bayor: black 😂😂😂😂 Ahhh black gate bayorrrrrrrrrr😂😂😂
Thank you sooo much for this beautiful story

The movie dey make sense aswear
Girls like shade no dey Nigerian again
🎉🎉🎉Take your flowers 💐 Omoni, Soso, Clinton and Ayo Adesanya. Infact the whole cast 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉This is a great and relatable story line.
Guys I know this is not the right place but do you think Clinton is a bad actor? And that there are areas he needs to work on? The person posted this movie and was saying things I can't even write hmm
I'm here for everyone 🎉🎉🎉🎉   Okay I have a lot to say (all lessons from this wonderful movie) but I will make it brief.   1. The power of influence (+ive or -tive) cannot be overemphasized and it only reinforce what the Bible says "bad company/association corrupts good morals" and "he that walks with the wise will become wise...".  2. Family can be toxic, just because they're family doesn't mean you have to keep them close.  3. There are FFF (Friends for food) they're only there when all is well but will leave the moment it gets bad and there are friends that stick even closer than a brother.  Okay I said it will be brief 😂😂😂. Bestie ❤❤❤ this is a 10/10 minus nothing, I didn't want it to end... Kudos to all the actors, crew members that brought the script to life...  More to come 🎉🎉🎉
No but honestly😂😂😂😂 Nigerian ladies don’t like birthday songs, when he was recording the song , I was just laughing 😂😂 for naija babe, a Queen was born 😂😂😂😂  He even bought birthday card 😂😂😂😂
Clinton I read meaning from this movie to ur real life  experience of life made u to be passionate in what u do and this is also the reason why you are disciplined in what u do also for ur unique skills and some roles u don't  fellow ur other actors to do like kissing in movie I don't know but I feel it well I respect it & love it too I pray God grant me the grace to always follow and support ur movie thank you sir for the movies u gave us thank you I enjoyed it

I don't know how you write your storyline or where you get it from, all i can say is you deliver the best inspirational and life lesson movies, Thanks ma and keep it up, God bless you ❤🎉.
Don jazzy part gat me laughing tho 😂😂😂
The movie is nice but I feel like Nigerians should improve when they act a musical film cause the artist don't really sing it word for word and it's noticeable and am always not impressed with the endings of our films not all though we could do better but it was a good movie
Mam Omoni take your flowers.
🥹🥰❤
Here for my favorite Clinton Joshua 😫❤️❤️❤️🥳
My favorite actor CJ more grace  ❤
❤❤❤❤fry the uk star boy am his bogey fan
Congratulations, it's a great job, Siter Omoni. When God is with us, who can do anything against you? So, thank God for this wonderful start. The best is yet to come. We are proud of the whole team. I'm French-speaking, but I love your work.❤❤❤
Starboy is a must watch by everyone,it's really a nice movie,who else is comenting after watching it all like me?
Don Jazzy abeg don't take our starboy😂😂
My actor u win the song even the voice so amazing keep it up your movies is always amazing
Clinton Joshua to the world🎉🎉🎉🎉😊
I just finish unlawfully yours and i run to come here i can miss clinton movie😂😂
Great production ma Omoni Oboli🎉🎉
First time seeing the girl that played Chisom. She has Ego and Uche Montana's face❤️ I wish she had more screen time 🥲
Star boy was distracted on his way to success moral lesson is do not be distracted on your journey to success
Voice behind Clinton's lip sync is very nice ❤
Couldn't wait for the weekend to pass by so here I am! The synopsis dragged me to watch by force 😶‍🌫️ Now, serious question, is that Clinton Joshua's real singing voice 😮?
Now this is one inspiring and lovely movie The actors did exceptionally good  To those who struggle and hope for a breakthrough I pray we get it soon Amen🙏
This is such an emotional and interesting movie. All the cast acted so well, kudos to them ❤. Experience is NOT the best teacher, instruction is. It’s very important to listen to elders they have been there, and done that. For a mother to stay away from her child there must be a crucial reason for it. As the proverb goes what an elder sees sitting down a youth may not see it standing😂.  Following instructions/ advice helps us avoid the pitholes of the enemy. Beautiful storyline❤️ Well done Omoni❤
Great Movie Clinton. More Grace
Clinton Joshua has a nice voice❤
CJ lovely voice ❤❤

"Every time Clinton Joshua steps into a role, he doesn’t just act — he becomes the story. This film is more than just entertainment; it’s a reflection of raw talent, deep storytelling, and the power of Nigerian cinema. Thank you, Omoni Oboli TV, for giving us yet another masterpiece. As someone who dreams of joining Nollywood, this movie reignites that fire in me. Truly inspiring." #STARBOY⭐

So nice🎉🎉
Let gather for soso and our Clinton ooooh🎉🎉❤😂😅😊
So nice🎉🎉
I’m just noticing her. I feel this movie made her shine
At least not the typical boy fall in love YouTube producers want to choke us with. It has a story around it about life, family, lifestyle, dreams, career, friendship more of this please.   Some of us are tired of all these over stretched love stories. There is more to and in life than just love stories, maybe we can start getting life stories.  What dreams without principles, discipline, determination and proper guidance can do to anyone.  We can be blind to things that really matter while chasing shadows.
Clinton my joy my happiness infarct his my everything ❤❤
Ma pls is  it really Clinton that was singing
Interesting ❤
Nice movie  Love Clinton Joshua
He is getting better and better with his acting  Stat Boy is awesome
My Clinton 💕
This movie gives so many lessons really it taught me that no matter the difficulties the trials of life never abandon your dreams and believe in yourself and God will help you realize them and never forget where you come from and the people who helped you realize your dreams❤
This movie is so beautiful 💗🍾
❤❤❤❤🎉
Awwwn my star boy, nice movie ❤❤❤
@ omoni oboli , this movie pulled some emotional strings in me. All that  glitters isn't gold, beware of people imposing their ideas in other to quench your Dreams. I loved the fact that Dekunle's mum made him know that FORGIVENESS  goes hand in hand with Moving forward. ❤🎉 Nice one.  All casts n crew did well.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Shade a sweet and an understanding friend, if because of those task force rubbish this people are great people and rich at least to eat something. No be Clinton get this voice,i sure die, but nice voice tho. You are dating someone that’s not dating you, you are dating yourself and you no dey see am. Will he get the job he has waited 2days for or would he loss the position to another person. Oh no he lost the position for the manager’s nephew because he doesn’t have connections, na why the rich oppressing the poor 😢. The stupid so called girlfriend he has be waiting to see was out with someone else and doesn’t care about how the poor DeKunle feels.  This his girlfriend has big eyes oo,so na breakup be that 😂😂😂,he didn’t get a job and now he lost his so called girlfriend. Which kind insult be this now,them no pay rent no mean say them dey useless na, the landlady get bad mouth oo. The guy don dey do paranpa to get money to survive, shade na better friend who wanna help her best friend make it, supportive friend. Them don enter competition ground, nice voices. The boy wey sing for Clinton get voice oo. Shade believed in him and his going far for just singing a song,why is he always talking about the Amaka babe na? Shade use style get bad mouth, the boy don dey blow oo, i hope he doesn’t accept the Amaka back. The guy just turn star like that mad oo. The boy mama collapsed and they need a huge money to operate on her and wants to leave the competition but the shade friend,his helper made him sing to raise the money,i pray he gets the money to save his mother. Shade use her modeling money to pay for his mum surgery,she’s truly a good friend. Better girl he no allow the boy take advantage of her. So the Bayo is his elder brother and his wealthy wow, wetin this Bayo boy do na?. The shade girl likes the boy but he no see am. I hope this Bayo won’t cause problem for Dekunle,his a scammer oo. Pls he should be careful oo with his so called brother, i hope he won’t sell his brother out, will the Don allow him go without a fight. I pray he doesn’t fall for the Amaka trap,she’s after you because of the fame, pls think about shade oo,she has been there for you oo. It’s the way he shut the landlady’s mouth for me,he should listen to his mother so he doesn’t regret it, tell him the truth about the Bayo maami, it’s his Yoruba for me. He should be calming down now,he shouldn’t have spoken to his mum like that because he has found money. This guy should just be careful and don’t allow his brother enter his head, what about shade? His brother is a bad influence to him oo, his mother is happy for him. Shade is still there for him, i hope he doesn’t break shade’s heart oo. He won oo nice and congratulations to him, i like his closeness with shade,why did his always do this and share no fit advice him, why did he invite her oh no she’s for the money not love. Wait the brother is having fun with another woman and doesn’t care if his younger brother is watching,take more money it’s your brothers,dollars na wetin Dekunle see and shock. He made love with Amaka and now Dekunle is doing bad things with his brother,so sad 😢😢. Dekunle’s mum knows Shade loves her son and is advising her right, i like that Shade knows what she wants and is opened to the Dekunle’s mum. Dekunle invited her and wants to take advantage of her due to his brother bad influence, it’s good that she hit him and went away, his behaving differently and rudely. You came to apologize to her and she saw your tap video with Amaka and now his career and her career are on the line.  Wow it was a set up from one of Bayo’s boy who he fired when he tried to double cross him, oh no they’ve arrested them both,Dekunle innocent boy 😢, someone else won the competition in place of him because of the false allegations,you can’t always eat your cake and have it. They have released Dekunle,Great movie with role well played. He indeed lost everything he has worked hard for, sorry kunle, my dear kunle you need to keep moving such is life for a man to fall and raise again. Great and understanding mother, forgiveness makes you move forward and greater. Will Adekunle make it big again? Will he be the Star ⭐️ boy again? He should go and apologize to shade oo, shade is no longer in her POS shop or did she travel? Her number is not reachable or she’s not willing to talk to him? His writing a song for shade mad oo,will shade come back? Shade came back hurry 🎉🎉🎉, I’m happy she did,she didn’t travel oh wow, his mother called her 😢😢. Shame dey speak wisdom abeg better friend ni girl e sha ❤❤. Shade girl is fine oo, now he knows she means a lot to him and her to him. Funny mother stopping them,when they want to kiss lol. I like that he came to apologize to his fans. Shade is a great cheerleader ❤❤, he don dey blow again, Shade is his lucky charm forget it. Don jazzy called him,mo fo oo,the voice sounded like the real don jazzy oo. I’m happy for his wins guys, great movie. Shade is blushing already.aww ❤❤ The mother is happy,it’s a win win for everyone. I’m happy,this movie is really heat touching ❤❤. The hairstylist never finish her hair,shade girl dey do too much, she said don’t look too much and be shining teeth.
Thanks Oboli. This is the best I have watched of Clinton. He used to be withdrawn, not really expressing himself. Just noticed Soso. Oboli knows how to make a Star out of nobody. Thank you.
Madam omoni oboli is really doing a great job..i give it to her🙌🙌 Can't wait to see my adorable OLUWABAMIKE "BAMBAM" in another block buster...anticipating❤❤
Wait was Joshua the one actually singing!?😂
Na that Davido part dey funny me pass😅😅😅😅
Adebayo suffered from the curse of the first born. The pressure to succeed can be all consuming.
And this really describe where I was coming from,iji ole sope korun ma run o
This movie is another master piece, Clinton is a good actor 🎉🎉🎉🎉
"You're here you're alive you're breathing you can start from there you have me you have your music you have your strength "👏Mothers love ❤️❤️Give this woman her flowers she did a great job 🌹🌹🌹A beautiful masterpiece well done Omoni Oboli 👏👏👏
Very intriguing film with an amzing cast, story, directing and productuon! Clinton was awesome ad Dekunle! Sophia was excellent as Sade! Ayo as Mama was great! Daniel as Bayo was well played! Enjoyed this film!

Clinton have a good voice Ho
I swear that is don jazzy's voice, nothing U wan tell me
So at the end of the whole thing, this movie is trying to tell us to be patient. Yes we have our plans but God has his own plans for us so we do not need to rush things. We can only make efforts, we can only try to do better for ourselves but we should not go about it the wrong way and we as humans should be contented because a man who is contented can overcome anything life throws at him also the kind of friend we keep is a reflection of how we turn out.  This was a great movie 🎥 as humans we should learn to be good friends to our friends and we should express how we feel about each other because a closed mouth will only hurt the heart😅
CJ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Clinton Joshua

I've always believed that Omoni Oboli crafts exceptional films. My admiration for this movie stems not only from Clinton Joshua's involvement, a talented actor I hold in high regard, but also from the captivating narrative and its masterful execution. The film's portrayal of life's realities resonated deeply with me, particularly the struggles that accompany the pursuit of stardom.  The movie's themes of authenticity and selfless love were beautifully woven throughout the story. The female lead's devotion to Clinton's character was genuine and untainted by ulterior motives. Her selflessness and focus on personal growth, while nurturing her love, were truly inspiring. Her refusal to settle for being a rebound, despite her deep affection, was a testament to her self-worth.  This film offers valuable lessons that our society and generation could greatly benefit from. The rewards of hard work, consistency, and intentional relationships are expertly depicted. The friendship between Clinton and Soso serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of having supportive companions who encourage personal growth and ambition.  One crucial takeaway from the film is the significance of understanding the source of one's resources before becoming entangled in any endeavor. Kudos to the director, producer, cast, and entire crew for bringing this impactful story to life.

Clinton is the reason other continents like Asia may watch   nollywood movies. His scripts or movies go in line with Philippines and India passion and romantic films.
I hope this is not Adekunle Gold story?
