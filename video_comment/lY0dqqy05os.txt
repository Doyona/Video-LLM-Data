She was an abusive partner, he never meant yo do it. He was trapped with her and didn't know how to get away. I honestly don't know if it's good for him that it's over or if it's bad because of how it had to end
They killed her off too soon.
i love peri and nadira 🥰❤️
I wasn’t expecting it to be Romeo Xx
They were milking this reveal soooo much only for it to be romeo.... kinda dissapointed
Well yeah but not really
I was really hoping it’d be she either took her own life or she wasn’t dead (this show jumped the shark decades ago, anyone who takes this show seriously 😂) because this was such a cheap, predictable and badly planned anti-climax to what could’ve been a rare case of female on male domestic violence case.
I think theres another twist and it wasnt Romeo she cant have just drowned from being pushed in a pool unless she hit her head
He legit just pushed her no seen of her hitting her head or her falling in the pool what is going on Hollyoaka
Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't it both romeo and prince's fault? I mean she had?a head injury from Prince so when romeo pushed her off him n she went in the pool  her injury was to much ? It was a head injury wasn't it ? Confused lol
07:00 There's just NO excuse for bad wigs on TV in this day and age! It totally stole all the scenes for all the wrong reasons! 😁
i knew itt
omg the acting is so bad
Romeo has been struggling dontie do anything to make him worse
I thought it would've been Nadira as Rayne was blackmailing her because Nadira stole Rafe's credit card 💳 to pay for the house 🏡 where Rayne threw her pool party. I hope the police 🚓🚨👮‍♀️🚔👮‍♂️ go easy on Romeo as he was obviously a victim of domestic violence and that they all make up with each other as everyone at that party was just as much a victim of Rayne as Romeo was. This storyline feels live it's been going on foverer though. Maybe Prince, Hunter, Peri, Lizzie, Zoe, Phoenix and Nadira will come together and make up with each other and support Romeo at his trial and maybe even Benny the taxi 🚕🚖 driver who drove them to the pool party will be asked as a witness at the trial and someone remarks "didn't you used to be Sinbad?".
It was so obvious that it was romeo i hope theres so sort of twist
I feel a twist coming on…they haven’t watched the whole video from that day! There’s more to this…
Romeo will be OK, he did it in self defence!  FREE PRINCE!
Well it was a accident  I say she is a bullie raynie anyway she was to a bullie to Romeo xxx
He's not going to like prison food daddy wont be able to save you romeo
Romeo Nightingale had killed Rain he will go to jail with a Tongan man
That whole story line was crap. Hollyoaks don’t do it like they used to.
It was Romeo Wow
0:07 thank you for the description i went blind suddenly and couldn’t see the people on the screen 💀
It would have been far more interesting for Rayne to still be alive and to have faked her own death to cause all this tension and infighting within the group as revenge for them exposing all her terrible behaviour. Having herself become a martyr-like beloved figure in the process who gains all these followers and gets all this attention. That feels more Rayne. She could have set up like fake accounts or whatever and is like on an island somewhere with a new identity watching all of this unfold from a sun lounger whilst these lot tear each other down. Like Rayne is that much of an evil manipulator that she would go that so for it to just be Romeo in an act of self defence feels a little bit pathetic in all honesty.
seen better acting on rent a ghost
It was self defence she was litrally punching him hope he don’t go down for this
This. SUCKS. What's the point of holding this plot for such long time? Thanks for wasting half an year of our lives.
but at least it as self defence
Juliet was the love of my life...... that's why I just played hide the salami with her brother..... lol there is not 1 single family member of James which  deserves to live..... end of.
Rayne's killer revealed is Romeo Nightingale and his friends in shock.
Ah here, you guys are impossible to please, you're never happy with anything this show does, it's like they can't do anything to please you, it is ridiculous and pathetic and idk why you even bother to still watch the show and comment about it when you guys clearly hate it, you complain about every single episode and storyline or you just look for something to complain about, why don't you lot just do one!
But wait who was it that used that thing to get everyone to the pool. Remember the "surprise waiting for everyone at the pool" or whatever it said that also sounded like Rayne?
Really? This looong drawn out who done it story ended with the obvious person to kill her? what a waste. We all said Romeo from the get go.
seeing as romeo is now the one who killed rayne it does kibosh the chances of him and peri being together
I thought Phoenix would be the killer but I hoped it would be Romeo because honestly I hate Romeo when he first came to Hollyoaks he destroyed Prince and Lily's marriage and then he took Lily out of hospital which resulted in her death. Romeo then decided to go for Mercedes another married woman he destroyed her's and silver's marriage this caused Silver to leave Mercedes and turned her son Bobby into a murderer. I feel that Romeo has done more harm than good and I believe Hollyoaks would be better off without him around
Seriously?
When I read you lied to us all, that reminds me of the scene when Liberty was saying, Summer had us all fooled😊May Summer Ranger return back onto our screens and marry Sienna please❤️Team Summer and Sienna💕Team Simmer💍
I dunno phoenix was acting kinda dodgy. I still think there's more to the story.
Nah their's more to see surely. All we saw was Romeo defending himself from an abuser Rayne and Rayne falling in the water, something else must've happened after surely it won't be left as Romeo
2 multiple by 10 plus 1 Romeo Done And still it's  I've got 21 seconds to pass the mic  I've got 21 seconds to say what I gotta say.
Ugh is that it? Dragged on far too long
So wheres all the 'Nadira did it' people
Now Some people need to apologise to peri some of use accused her that's low so u all better be felling sorry for your self and it's not romeo fault he was abused so please stop no hate pleas just my opinion
Still think it's Phoenix, it's too simple to be Romeo
If peri found the video she would have destroyed it.
It has such a Pretty Little Liars Vibe to it as well.
And all he has to do... is call self-defence.
😂😂Dragged this out forever and I was ultra hoping it would of been lil lacey 😅
Romeo! HOW COULD YOU!
It was Pheonix. Romeo didn't kill her
The Trailer made it look like it was Phoenix who murdered Rayne .
Really?! So it was him the whole time. Bruh what a drag🙄
Very anticlimactic! Not even worth the wait! Obviously self defense!
🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱
Thank god it's over. No wonder HO has been moved from tv to you tube.
That was so dumb lol
I had a feeling it was maybe romeo but if you see the video it was in self defence she was hitting him and slapping him abusing him so even if they show the police they have take it into consideration that it was self defence if they don't it's pure stupid
So I watched the first look, Romeo did it because he admitted but at the end of the episode there was a twist. This is just my theory I think Rayne might be alive,  I know you guys are thinking  but how? We saw her body, you are correct but what if she revived in the hospital and put into witness protection, she manipulated some cop falling for her, so she can seek revenge on Romeo. This is theory sounds stupid because it is.
How exactly did she drown when she went into the pool? Did she hit her head before she went in? Obviously she can swim so it couldn't have been her not knowing how to swim.
I bet there’s a twist to it
So we waited for this🙄still not convinced,sorry
So it was the predictable version, how, uh, predictable 🤷
Would make sense if it was Hunter because, why would he go out of his way to expose Peri and Romeo? 🤔 missed opportunity there, Hollyoaks.
I knew it was Romeo all along 😮
Ridiculous reveal and boring. They should’ve done the reveal far sooner as well.
That surely can't be the end of it? That was the worst reveal I've ever seen. What an anti climax!!! Also, if Rayne got up after hitting her head, and was fine and able to attack Romeo, then why wasn't she able to get out of the pool too?
i dont think he killed her cause she did get up and he push her in to the water then she dies makes somehow no sense
Why they dressing lizzy to look like a potato 🥔. This reveal has taken way to long 😕, they dragged it on so long we all got to the point where we didn't care anymore 🤷‍♀️
Take that video straight to the police. Don't, I repeat don't, show that video to James. James will conceal evidence just like he told Peri to do when he told her to destroy Rayne's phone. James does not want the truth to come out; he just wants to prevent his son from being charged with Rayne's death. James knows the village already thinks of him as an abuser; James does not want his son to be charged.
How is Prince trying to take a morale high ground here when his been trying throw Perri under the bus from the get go
This anticlimactic totally predictable ending is what this prolonged torturous buildup was for???  Good lord. I was hoping Hollyoaks would subvert expectations, but these writers can't produce a good plot to save their lives.
Ahhh who beat him up and chucked him in the van?
Are you kidding me with this? Romeo knew Prince was innocent from the start and let him go to jail for his crime? Everbody has been tearing at each other like animals and he was to blame the entire time. Hunter needs to knock Romeo's lights out for this.
At this rate peri could literally be rayne is disguise 😂😂
I knew that it was him so this story line was for nothing 🙄 😒 😕 🤨 and so did other people think it was him as we'll.
So you are telling me that Hollyoaks embarked on a storyline depicting a very important, underrepresented issue, abuse of male partners at the hands of their female partners. And they not only copped out of dealing with the actual consequences of such a topic by turning it into a whodunit? But they also made the male victim the killer? Who in the world approved this bulls***?!
Stop the cap
We need to find out Hunter attack James
Ugh, I had a feeling, but I was hoping that it was anyone except for Romeo.  He was the most obvious suspect.
Romeo tell me that's true?
Really wasn't shocked at all. And can we please show respect to Hunter for calling Romeo out on how quickly he'll turn on his friends over some girl. I really hope he leaves the show after this because I think we can all agree that he is a terrible friend and person. He and Peri deserve one another, both awful people.
Jeez Rayne did lay into romeo, before he pushed her,
I knew it from the beginning
Went for obvious suspect
It was an accident!? 🙄
it was self defence she was hitting and attacking him
I can't see it was romeo he pushed her into the water, not punched her so she was out cold, so surely she could have just got out the pool
It was self defense
What a waste of time 😅
How’s the glasses cam getting different angles
I knew it was Romeo! Looking at it, it was self defence and he didn’t mean to kill her. Overall great and intense storyline.
It’s always the lover unless there more to it? But how there can’t be she was in the pool
Cant be the only one getting riverdale series 1 vibes from this  Also i still dont understand how pheonix became part of all this in the first place?
This is such a disappointing reveal, i really thought it would be Nadira. Peri has been really unlikable character recently. This storyline has really ruined her.
Were we really surprised though? I mean someone getting abused it all had to come to this at some point Romeo had more of an intimate motive then anyone else anyone else was just a decoy
Romao falls in and out of love in 3 months and Peri got "married " to a woman and is now in love with her brother-in-law who is a man wtf send them to jail
That was so obvious
Ok, so Peri, Hunter AND Romeo all kept things from their friends and the police. But Romeo can't be charged for murder. Rayne was going nuts on him and he pushed her back. Isn't that self-defense? Also, even if it's not, it's manslaughter at best. I know that's not good either, but it's not murder.
Ugh worst hollyoaks reveal ever! But have I missed something I thought he was sleeping with peri at the time??
4:14 WD those guys (in the background need to stop arguing)#Hollyoaks #All4 🙄
Hunter finally giving Romeo what he deserves
Wow that is messed up for him to call her a ho because he made a video saying that she is guilty. He owes her a big apology
That doesn't prove Romeo killed her.Toxic rain was hit on the side of her head with something.She got out of the pool after she was pushed in.
The writing in this storyline sucks
Oh my OA I know that all of you are think that Romeo’s the final piece to the puzzle but I don’t think it’s over I mean they did this the same way with the “Who killed Amy?” puzzle everyone thought it was Ste, then everyone thought it was Harry but then it turned out to be Ryan. Here’s my theory, after Romeo had left she was swimming to the edge and then someone was there and tried to help her out of the pool and then Rayne started an argument with that Person and then that’s when they killed Rayne and she ended up back in the pool. I just hope it’s not Phoenix or Nadira but I’m still thinking it was Zoe after all she wasn’t there with the group when they were all watching the evidence I’m sure there’s more to this puzzle that meets the eye. 🤔
that was so self-defence
All of this BS for months for all of it to be Romeo 😂😂😂 This writers are on something
I dont think that was the end and i dont think its romeo i think theres another twist to come......
Truthfully he didn’t mean too because he was just trying to protect himself however it is messed up for him to not say anything
0:52 1:01 how disgusting literally mentioning her dead girlfriend and 2 seconds later how she was in bed with the same girlfriends brother what a cow
This has to be the worst reveal I’ve seen. All that just to be Romeo. 🤦🏾‍♂️
Also how did she even die like did she drown cause the pool looked shallow
Romeo kills Rayne because she was abusing him that was self defence 😮😮
I KNEW IT!!!
OMG! What?! It was Romeo who killed Rayne all this time! WOW, just wow. I was absolutely shocking and shaken and I did not expected to see that. Brilliant performance from Owen Warner in tonight’s episode of Hollyoaks. 😱🔥
It was clearly self defence!
I haven’t watched this show in a couple of weeks, but wasn’t the killer already revealed ?
Romeo is actually pathetic like please get rid of him ever since he arrived in the village he had been an issue and the way he went on letting everyone think Prince killed her and really stood there and said we will vouch for him in court and crying over rayne pretending he didn't know he killed her then sleeping with peri is there any reason to like him 🙄
I knew it was romeo   It's not really murder tho it was an accident also when he found her in the water he was very convincing the way he acted so distressed
I knew it all along.
Romeo I knew it
Hollyoaks cool video
First
