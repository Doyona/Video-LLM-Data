Roger Craig Smith jumpscare
1:14 thought he was gonna say my dog butch 😂 but he said himself lol
What season was this
Chef james you could say, IS COOKING. 🔥
To answer your question no it didn’t flop, it made profit. But hey the Snyder fans can wipe there tears with the Snyderverse movies that carked it after two movies 😂
Did Roe really just throw a fit over not being able to take over a pan of chicken. The guy was literally cooking it for her and she flips out that she doesn't get to finish it.
Gordon looks so happy in anticipation of the competition. This has to be his favorite moment in the whole show.
Roe is terrible. She’s out for herself and it showed. She didn’t want to listen about her mistakes and worried more about herself looking bad.
James and andi acting like contestants made this one of the best episode. Along with their interviews.
4:10 does Chef Andi technically contaminate the food when she tastes it then shakes the excess back in the pan?
FDJT
Is anyone else bothered by how close she has her face to the pan when she is basting the steak? That heat directly on her face is probably making her sweat all over the food, not to mention any spit that is coming out of her mouth when she is talking...
Ive noticed in the later seasons of Hell's Kitchen that Gordon is in a better mood outside of service. Hes pretty joyful and buzzing with energy. In the older seasons of the show i BARELY saw him smile.
4:12 i know she didn't taste the food then tap the spoon back into the pan!!!!!! 🤢
Me whenever they mess up: "i could do that"
La belleza siempre tiene un precio alto
man working in a kitchen like this would give me ptsd
the chef overseeing all of gordon's u.s. stores is really gorgeous
IT’S RAWWW!!!!! OHHH MAEYY GAWD COME EAR!!!
James was a savage all night !!!
I want to partisipate in this kitchen 😊
Maybe you should share yours now ok but will you share yours when its ready? NO 😂😂😂
Dude imagine being there listening to the yeoling sitting in the dining room waiting for food.
Bro called james jimmy
Bro how is the dream machine doing this. Repeating orders accurately? Id be dying halfway through service if i was there
Btw guys u know Charlie Kirk was in this video in 3:02
Where’s JP? What season is this?
Did she tast it and than did the spoon back in again ?
So much for having fun lol
Basically 1v6 ......One guy doing it all-James🔥 Andy who?😂
When Legend joins the battlefield
Biggest Flex for the sous chefs. ❤
i was hoping ramsay would start screaming to his own team the same way he does the black jackets
He didn’t say hold my ale
2:02 Steve blake cameo 😂😂
I like seeing James and Andi in the hot seat😂
Guys. I recognize the narrator. Its Roger Craig Smith, aka Sonic, Ezio Auditore, Deidara, etc. He narrated two seasons, 13 and 14
new show idea, just a supercut of elite kitchens crushing massive dinner parties. watching andy and james do like 10 tables perfectly in 15 seconds was crazy
"There were just 3 of us"  Gordon being busy scolding black jacket team 99% of the time:
Who tf is Steve Blake? Certainly no celeb...
Jennifer could be a model.
I cringe when the customers pretend to be foodies.  Shut up and eat your rice.
11:46
Jennifer being the sous chef on the left side while chef Ramsey and two sous chefs James and Andi are on the right side making it all mission impossible on making food perfect
It's always so cool to watch professionals works together. They still managed to make jokes in what i'd be stressed in under pressure situation. They all do it with ease.
Imagine he kicked out Andi or James
I wish they did this challenge more often. i love seeing the sous chefs cooking
Couldn't help but laugh because i knew immediately after they started cooking he was gonna send something back to them because it was raw and start yelling about it 🤣
Fifteen Michelin-stars divided over how many restaurants?
I thought Jen did an excellent job running the pass
Very impressive..
What 3 of us...that was all james 😂😂
Not he hurting your feelings 😂😂
Who ever sat on the red side of the dining room that night they got a good service tasty and efficient
Did anybody else catch what I saw?????  Andy, (sous chef) tastes the rice,  then slapped the rest on the spoon BACK into the same pan!!! Did I see that right??? Even if it didn't have rice on the spoon, it still has saliva, right??? Shouldn't you taste then get a new spoon???
chef james kinda looks like johnny sins
Why gordon so holding back...hes not mad like he used to be😂
This is how restaurants are I never see anyone get yelled at when I go
To me Andy and Scott was perfect for hells kitchen. Andy was sweet yet strong, and Scott was strict yet kind. Balance of those two were just perfect exemplar of high standards.
Why does the voiceover sound like sonic but with a serious voice
Love how the normally intimidating Chef James turns into cute ‘Jimmy’ with Chef Ramsay
This is my favorite episode of hells kitchen.
7:15 idk how they can rmb all dat 💀i forgot after he just said it 😂
We need Marco Pierre White to join.
11:45 valid response
1:38 Narrator: "This will be the only time that Chef will have a kitchen run by only he and his other selected chefs for the season."
"The Dream Team, not surprisingly" lol Feels like the Dream Team of 92 vs the world
8:49 who tf this
This so much BS drama, Manufactured for TV. so Dumb
Gordon was just picking on Sous Chef James to add some drama. James knew it was for the show. He was hammering out perfect entries all on his own. Masterclass chef.
Gordon: "The last chef is...." Black Jackets: Why do I hear boss music? Gordon: "Me!" *Boss health bar appears*
seemed like 2 vs. 6 to me 😂
The scallops looked perfect Ramsay just called them overdone to generate drama.
Penn Jillette jumpscare good heavens
The Omaha Steaks guys were straight outta sitcom 😂 He actually did get a share of Wellington too
Well, not just 3 but 2 of them. Gordon was with the Mormons entire time…😂
One armed bandit would have carried this team.
4:45 pre FOOL US Penn was quite hefty, he looks so much healthier now
he cooks walks across calle there order out tells them somethigs wrong goes back cooks serves comes back sends tsbles calls more orders and still doesnt break a swet gorden is truely a g
That’s so nasty. So many different hands touching that steak!
This is from 20yrs ago why cant yall put the date of these old ahhhz videos it says posted 4 days ago and lots of these dumbahzzz people think its NEW
Imagine if they won and he had eliminate one of the sous chefs
7:27 A doctor, an astronaut, a fireman, a mailman, and now a chef? This guy just knows everything.
Chef James and Andi showed how elite they are dangggg
4:12 did she just straight up taste and just smack everything back into the pan?
11:42 was pure comedy
When they are interviewing for a spot on this show, they have to use the "F" word at least a hundred times before they even have a chance to be on the show.
f I were a guest dining in Hell’s Kitchen and Chef Ramsay was yelling at the staff in the open kitchen, I’d definitely feel uncomfortable. Even if the food is amazing, the loud yelling would ruin the atmosphere for me. I’d probably speak to the waiter or waitress about it — not to get anyone in trouble, but just to say it doesn’t create a good vibe for people trying to enjoy a nice meal. It really disturbs the dining experience.
What season is this one
It’s funny how Gordon is in both kitchens at the same time 😂
For how many times they say “cooking scallops is the easiest” and than proceed to mess them up, I’m not really trusting that statement
3:47 Why did she say "It is tasteless, it's delicious"? Is lady high or something?
"will you share yours?" "no"
This was insane. My heart dropped at the raw lobster 💀
Letting Gordon smoke you with half the people while coming over to clown everything you do is crazy😭
Been on a Hell’s Kitchen clip binge for a while now and I have to say…  Does anyone else notice that Chef Ramsay has a tan line around his eyes in most of the clips? I wonder if he rides motorcycles or goes skiing or something.  Either way, put on some sunscreen my man.
Making a risotto taste exceptional is hard. Making one look exceptional is probably near impossible, as ALL the other stuff looked great, while the risottos were... well... Not nearly as good looking.
4:10 so you are telling me that one of the best upcoming chefs Gordon has seen tastes the risotto and then taps the spoon facing the risotto on the pan? Not expected.
ive seen elite race winning horses get ridden softer than James did
4:12 she would’ve been fired on the spot. The fact that gordan didn’t say anything was crazy.
This really put into perspective the talent and skill those three have. The mistakes being made by the amateur chefs aren’t accidents or Gordon being harsh because look, it can be done with a third of the number of people with nearly zero problems. Idk. Love this episode
PENN?? WHAT are YOU doing here??
I want to see gordan Ramsey against Chef Jean pierre
Actually, it wasn't 3 against 6, but 2 against 6, because Ramsey had to manage both teams at the same time
10:58 lol😂
The announcer should have said: Chef Andi, James, and Gordon will make 6 black jacket chefs cry
The way 2 sous chefs and head chef with half attention on another kitchen doing it so smoothly while 6/7 chefs on one side struggling every episode justifies Ramsay's anger and frustration
Chef “Uncle Phil”. 😂. If ya know, ya know.
This is the cooking equivalent of struggling to run fast enough for the army while the Sargeant is running 6 minute miles with a cigarette in his mouth 🤣
This is just a testament to how legendary Chef Ramsay is, as well as Chefs James and Chef Andi
Chef James has the queen come to dinner. He should work a bit faster.
What happened with John phillipe 😭😭
VIP Steve Blake lol 😂😂😂
This seems chaotic just for the sake of making TV, outside that there's no reason for it to be like that.
2:13 chef Andi she's gangsta 😮😂
Don't see a team. Trash talking each other consistently.
Why is Gordon’s forehead so red?
3 of us ????? Bruhh Ramsay was literally switching from one kitchen to another that was a 2 men team 😂😂😂😂😂
Coucou Easy AI, merci pour ce tuto. Est-ce que tu aurais un outil pareil pour traduire un Film de l''Anglais au Français. Un mini logiciel dans lequel je pourrait  uploader ma vidéo anglaise et en sortir la version Française
Crazy that Sonic The Hedgehog narrated hells kitchen
Sanji
The only episode worth remembering of an otherwise forgettable season with the worst choice for winner that season
“will you share yours wItH mE?” “NoO”
I don't understand the chef attitude. I never met too much pepper. I have never met a burger or steak that is underdone. Over done plenty of times but under? Not a once. Food waste, elitism, assholeism
*Woah* that's cool
‘There’s one more chef joining me and my sous chefs. This man was the youngest chef to win 3 Michelin stars, my mentor, and, some might say, the first ever celebrity chef….’  *Marco Pierre White walks in*
Maybe we should share now Will you share with me when you get yours? No
It looks like Gordon is omnipresent.
6:13
1:48
❤❤🎉
You can see they are highly professional by the way they are communicating..its like no matter how successful you are, the basics should be followed, and your job will be easy- people will appreciate your work coming back for more.
Gordon sabotage them for a good show.
Ramsey aura farmin
This is why I stopped cooking, too many sweats
Wish they would have done this dinner service again in other seasons with the Elite Chefs vs Black jackets.
love his reaction at the end after being complimented by chef ramsey lol
What if pag anjan si ninong ry?
2 v 6 then 😂
Bryant def should have won that season
I understand that the team of Gordon's were 3 talented chefs with alot of experience. But the fact that the 3 of them had finished 5 whole tables ahead of the black team is just sad. And that woman who was in charge of meat had zero accountability, imagine that. Also the whole team didn't seem to understand how to communicate properly and effectively. That wingman dude was right when he said "first I'm being grilled cause I'm not helping, then I get grilled for helping!" If they had a problem with him taking over the meat, they should have told him what station to help with. The whole team had problems there, except for that one guy Gordon praised at the end.
I bet James was using less than 50% of his power.
I like how the sous chefs started to talk smack on the confessionals.
maybe you could share. i would be happy to share. could you share now? will you share yours with me when you get it? no
hearing ramsay be so nice to the sous chefs was so amusing. He's simply like: thank you :)
I’ve enjoyed this show in the past and have no delusions of the “vocabulary” of kitchen staff, but if the show is going to”F” bomb constantly then I’m done, and will watch other culinary shows.
If Sterling didnt mess up on the previous service, he wouldve been in this batch.  I would've loved to see Sterling show his positive attitude and coordinate the whole brigade.  Im sure they wouldve done a bit better than how they did here
5:40 oh yh you critise the scallops, and what do you do here ? 5:52
Look at andy and james can be soo smooth..thats the team dynamic you need
QUERY:::this senior dude of 74 yrs old wishes to know what happens to the food that don''t make it??  SEND us in JAX FLA a 1 # box of the bad foods..I dont mind eating  overcooked scallops or  a chicken that's burned..WE GET that from Senior center  lunches..They try to make it bestest. but a chicken  patty fried is shoeleather..it took them 9 months to make a superb chicken  patty ::floured..and most excellent.!      I ate 3 of them and it WAS chicken !  peace  Thisguysmusic wishes to eat the not ready for the dinner table bad foods.
My best part is that that charlatan called Jamie O, wouldn't even qualify as a contestant.
Any idea what music is used between 9:43 and 10:30? The pace of it is amazing
Is the narrator Sonic?
If I don’t remember this episode then I’m  super down to watch every season again
What  be so wrong about a little pepper on the salad? I would end up putting pepper on it anyway.
Is it just me or Chef Andi Fine AF!
4:11 I never realized Chef Andi did that smh
To be fair, the Chef kitchen only had 2 and a half, because Ramsey had to bounce back and forth and help plate for them.
These people arent real cooks, thats why there are so many mistakes, makes for good ratings.
gordon doing the plating for both teams WHILE cooking himself, is insane
Don't worry viewers, Roe wasn't good in either season she was in
7:44 the pan Gordon put down tho
Does it bother anyone else that they're not wearing gloves? I mean they are really hands on with the food.
james has such a good attitude. thats how to succeed in life
11:41 - I like this guy
Guest 1: “Maybe you should share with me now.” Guest 2: “Okay. Will you share with me when you get yours?” Guest 1: “No” 😂😂😂
All of them 3 are better you all combined!
Santos calling out someone for making a mistake: “Okay valid.”Santos after Chef Ramsay calling out a mistake: “I’m getting yelled at 😢.” Am I the only one who thinks Santos is really overrated?
Remember kiddo, these greasy reality show producers coach these”contestants”. This is a show. Scripted, and acted, with a dash /pinch of reality. Know your enemy. My pinky has more truth than this performance. And BTW, it is edited to the second. Welcome to the show.
no way 4:11 she just tasted the food and put the spoon back
Man I hate the USA version, long live the australian one!
Is that steve blake?
Crazy that Kyle Crane is the narrator
Imagine if they also had a "Yellow Kitchen" and it's just Marco with a meat cleaver.
Bryant’s whaaaaat reaction at the made me laugh
I like in the kitchen  work.
chef james look like johnny sinsss
That was a lose lose for the blackcoats no matter how you look at it. They win? They beat a team half their size one of the members who is in their kitchen half the time fixing their mistakes and expoing for them....
chef andy got soul..... iykyk
4:11 I’m surprised Gordon didn’t call her out for this
I think it would be nice to watch more pros' work to understand the desired rhythm.
gers
In vietnam like fasdfood on a .......
Who tf is Steve Blake 😂 💀
Chef James rules it was just impressive how he was able to do those entrees
Gordon Ramsey is making a movie in my town right now
Gordon actually declared himself the winner of the competition and was awarded $250,000 😂
Why is Santos whining like a baby?  Pathetic.
WHO WON??
14:53 bro is shocked at this
Anyone notice at 4:10 chef Andi tastes the risotto with a spoon and then immediately taps the leftovers back into the pan?
I hope they do this kind of challenge again in the future seasons.
This might be the only time over all the seasons that the Sous chefs get those confessional segments.
14:34 Not even three of them. It was mainly James working the food and Andi plating while Gordon was going back and forth and staying in the blue kitchen most of service.  So more accurately, from what we saw anyway, it was more like 2 against 6.
Gordon straight up went raid boss challenge on them
Roe really thought she was getting the props at the end hahaha
they should've repeated this twist for the two all stars seasons, considering the growth of some of the returning contestants who made it to black jacket team
Roe blames everyone else for her short comings.
Wow.. the skill gap is insane
"Will u share urs when u get it" got me
The ultimate flex is that Gordan is cooking for the reds and checking on the blues all at the same time
One last comment: How many times do contestants forget the order Gordon just said when its a single table, meanwhile Gordon fired off three in a row and James repeats it all like a parrot instantly.  That's a man with passion.  Gordon knows how to pick sous chefs across the board in any season.
1:07 now that’s a smile
video??
Chef James is just from another planet nailing everything and being far ahead against an entire team. And he still got attacked by Gordon so much! Shows how brutal that world is and how high Gordon’s standards are.   Black jacket team would crumble in just 5 minutes
Too much noisy like ducks working inside
14:53 that “woaaah” kills me
Chef Ramsey, facing against them and also running the whole thing at the same time amazing
You know its bad when 3 chef manage to outpace 6 chef
chef james is a champion
people arent seeing the picture its not about experience or jackets he says it even its numbers gain. with 6 they should have been able to finish it and they were even ahead at times
Lol call themselves chefs but cooked raw 😂
Don’t you just love how the title says Gordon Ramsey like he was alone
It was really heartbreaking to see Latasha walk out after being so strong until this night. I stop watching then because I was left wondering who could possibly win
I worked for Chef Amoroso, he is easy to get along with .if you work well .
And not one of them could work at a McDonald's😅
Scrub to 4:10 - Gordon's Chef uses a tasting spoon then taps off remaining rice from the spoon back into the food. I would expect more.
'Come on guys, lets go'  Always a helpful diatribe
I love people who get serious and elevate their effort to the level required.
What season is this
1:38 look at his arms
"Im not sending him raw chicken" Well, you sent raw steak - TWICE
Them just tackling 3 tickets at once as 2 people faster than the team of 6 could clear 1 ticket of apps. Absolutely insane multitasking.
there’s a reason they’re Gordon’s sous chefs 😂
I feel like Gordon Ramsey would be really good at RTS games
This is the equivalent in facing Matt in Wii Sports boxing
chef james welldone
VIP Steve Blake 😂😂😂😂😂
The tehnique and psihological tricks that Chef Ramsey is doing its Amazing he is ironing them to be one of the best chefs in the world
its always fun seeing people who are masters of their craft show why they are masters of their craft. When gordon calls that order at 7:08 to his team and they say yes like its no big deal haha. Id forget the whole order and f up 50% of the dishes
Chef james is like bugz bunny playing baseball, 1st base, 2nd, 3rd, home run. Handling all entrées and Gordon busting him about the mash potato 😂
Looking back on this you can see at what levels pros are, chef james is single handedly handling all entrées, chicken, welly, garnish......and fish while On the other side 5 people doing that
I cant be the only one thinking that this is thhe speed kitchen game thing but in real life...
"will you share yours with me?" "No"
It says 3 vs 6, but the truth is.... it's actually 2.1 vs 6.9 Chef Gordon is too busy helping and screaming at the black jackets
I like how Gordon just can't help himself and just *has* to throw barbs into both kitchens even though the Sous Chefs were doing (unsurprisingly) great. British level of sarcasm and humour for ya :P
" I cannot let fish take me down." 🤣
Gordan Ramsay is the main character
It was more like 2 vs 6 and then 1 vs 6 sorry for saying that Gordon Ramsay
Its like a boss battle with this
If i had that experience, I'd want the main thre against me ( Marco ,Gordon, and heston)
4:07 Did Andi just taste from the spoon then put it back in the pan with the risotto? 😳
what season and year was this? Gordon Ramsay looks so young here
Chef James really is a BEAST in the kitchen.. But even he's not safe from Ramsay's wrath! 😂
@4:10, the pro female chef double dipped her spoon. Yuk!!
Watched this in my computer class.
I have worked in many kitchens and I can assure you that taste spoons often get dipped again, doesn't matter what kitchen. If one would use a new spoon everytime there would be zero spoons left.
I know they're not on best terms but it would've been awsome if MPW was headchef for that night
4:46 is that pen from pen and teller?
We need this more often easily my favorite service from this forgetful season
That sunburn on Gordon is vicious lol
The fact that there's 2 chefs in the dream kitchen and Chef James is doing all of the entrees and keeping up just goes to show how good he is. It took the Black team 6 people and they still had mistakes. Granted, a great small team is better than a good big team. It's just so natural for them, it's inspiring to watch, even as someone who doesn't have any interest in cooking.
Chef james despite getting drilled by chef ramsay, he still maintained a positive attitude, he just seems happy doing what he does. He also has excellent communicating skills
Such beautifull food ❤❤
“You have to cut it to know the temperature” = not a chef.
Gordon cooking with a 3 person team and keeping charge of the black jacket have to be the biggest flex.
Tbh, every time he calls the entire team over to show them something, that loses them time because they have to leave their station.
Love when Roger Craig Smith narrates things. I just imagine all the characters he's ever acted, narrating the episode.
Lol there was more like 2 cooking , chef was calling the blue kitchen the whole time lol
But Ramsey, you are awesome
I love these HK videos, but what is deal with the interviews? In the middle of the cooking. OFC it's about creating some kind of drama, and fabricated rivalry;  but come on, it is so cringe and unprofessional. Just keep to the cooking, alright. I have used this as an example how to make something unexciting into something thrilling with my students. Fascinating.
What would have been a good plot twist:  Marco Pierre White walks in.
Is that roger craig smith?
Jesus loves you all
Lobster is not fish. And these folks are supposed to be professional chef's ?
why does Ramsay need a pencil for tho?
This is a rare moment where both James and Andi got interviewed
santos needs a redemption arc
Chris redfield what are you doing Narrating Hell's kitchen?
Dude I am aware that chefs wash their hands and everything, but ALLLL of EVERYONE’S hands touching the food hurts me 🤣
Hey wait a minute Chef James shares his last name with the late great James Avery?  He should get to toss a contestant out physically for that!
steak wallington still raw after 1 year. not served yet
My question is. Where is chef Christina!? I worked with chef James and he’s sooo cool! Still need Christina in these!
This 2 vs 6 was brutal.  😬😬
James.. you didn't do anything wrong.  Ramsey just wanted to remind the contestants that anyone can get it.  hahaha
Johnny Sins is a great chef
4:01 the way the voiceover says “appetizers” sounded like he was slipping into another accent lol
4:41 "This is really good" Magician so good he knows it is before he tastes it.
Why do I hear boss music?
3:20 A yes the pure majestic challenge of the incredible fish
This was like NBA players vs G-league players lol
You know you’re COMPLETELY outclassed when your opponent STILL manages to come over to your side and tell you what’s wrong
How is this, Gordon still in business? Why is he putting his fingers on the customer food? The main reason I dont eat at places like that, how disgusting it is?
Still miss chef andi and James today
It seems like Gordon’s “grilling” of Chef James is in jest and just messing with him. You can see him smiling when getting on him
Season 13 the most forgettable season ever! Roe came back in 18 and I was like what season?
4:10 Chef Andy tastes the food with her stirring spoon then shakes the spoon back into the pan.
i like to think there were 2 gordon ramsays and he cloned himself so they could compete against him
Roe is the worst type of person to work with. Think they know everything and good at their job when actually everyone think they’re a joke.
Chef James looking at the Black Jackets like “I’m boutta show you how you get rid of that stripe”
Gordon is hands down the best chef living if not all time
It’s always the Karen’s 😂
“Mabye you should share now”  “Would you share with me?”  “No” -cuts-
They weren't 6 against 3. They were 6 against 2.5, because Ramsay was still busy managing both kitchens.
"I think you should share *now."* "Will you share yours when you get it?" "No!"
For the life of me, I don't understand how a teammate can tell you your meat is raw and then you try to say they are wrong. Just cut it and fix it bro. its not about the chef's ego, its about the customer's satisfaction and how the ego gets in the way.
Me: *arrives for my table on the red side, seeing Gordon and his sous chefs will be cooking my food  JP: Welcome to Hell's Kitchen, can I take your order.  Me: I'll have the entire menu and 5 Wellingtons, please 🍽️🍽️🍽️🍽️🍽️
7:36 lol the look it the best lol
"Maybe we should share. Maybe you should share it with me now." "Will you share yours with me when yours get here?" "No."😂😂😂😂
4:11 ???
I mean the editing makes the show super predictable since like season 2. Kind of why I stopped watching.
4:10 chef Andy taste the risotto and then taps the risotto back in the pan with the same spoon she ate off that is sooooo disgusting 🤮
Why does Gordon Ramsey have to use filthy language? What’s wrong with him and others who use that language? They set a terrible example for others, especially young people  They should be ashamed of themselves
Leave it to Chef Ramsay to tease the Chef with the most on his plate. I love Chef James <3 he got grilled like the chicken he was trying to get out .
James is not human. Guy is a beast.
Andy and James cooked better being mostly on their own compared to 6 other chefs all working together.
At 4:10 you can see Andi taste the spoon and then knock it back into the pan, its hard to tell after the cutaway if she swapped the spoon or is using the same one she put her mouth on....
"I'm happy to share, but you'll share yours with me when you get it yeah?"  "No"  😂😂😂
steve blake the real dog in this clip
Whats the point with ramseys pen behind the ear?
The narrator sounds like the guy that plays Batman in Arkham origins
It’ll never not be impressive that the three of them handled that entire service on their own.   I’m still in awe at how powerful a team the three of them were.
Idk about y’all but at 4:11 alone would’ve been a big deal if I’m judging
Ramsay has 17 Michelin stars and his team bossin. I could never do that. Lol dang.
Bro I can’t unsee Gordon’s goggles sunburn lol
yesss chief
the final boss battle epic scene im telling you
_"Will you share yours with me when you get it?"_  *"No."*
4:07 she just tastes the food and drops back in the remains that her mouth 100% made contact with back in the pan?
“right now.. i think his wing is broken??” got me cracked uppp 😭😭
Is it me or the “ceasar salad” its just lettuce with sauce?
11:40 Me with my sibIings
I just realised 2 and a half minutes in that the guy doing the voiceover is Batman from Batman Origins. Now I can't focus on anything else so I'm passing the knowledge along.
11:38 Probably one of the funniest customer conversations I've ever seen on this show.
Awesome!
Roe lowkey look like Kamala Harris
Click, Mongral, and Faze sway vs Ninja, DrLupo, Myth, Tfue, Nick Eh 30, and sypher
Extremely misleading title
Ramsay didnt even focus on sou chefs... They just do their thing... The trust is 1,000%
Chef James is a beast!
red kitchen customers had to be the luckiest customers in entire hell's kitchen
14:52 She was acting like "Yeah, it was me" and then Gordon went "And it's Brian's" Nice
Chef Andi is so hot
It's strange hearing Batman narrate hells kitchen
It's like they're doing a 6 man boss encounter with only 3 people.
This is almost equivalent of a soon-to-be real Soldiers against a veteran Special Forces unit in the same field.
Chef James is a culinary GOD :)
i want to see james and scott do this w gordon, i want to see james work again and i wanna see how scott would perform
i just hate it when someone wears a ring on his finger and touches the food with it
15 Michelin Stars, insane!
What and who is the sous chefs people talking about in the comments ?
Two chicken walkingg
I had no idea Andi oversaw operations for the US, that’s pretty insane
Steve Blake is a nobody. Might have been somebody like LeBron after attending one of Diddy's freak offs!
Jonah in the belly of the whale be like   3:19
@4:11 chef Andi tastes the dish the knocks her slops off the spoon back into the dish, very special!!!!!!!!
No one notice Penn Jillette on 4:44 ?
You don't season Scallops, they're already salty jesus who are they
Why are they just staring at it instead of probing?
3:08 that wouldve ended up different
Chef james is the real deal hes like a monster machine
Stress vs Flow         you are welcome
9:52 - Gordon did say he wanted it on a plate, Chef James starts plating then Gordon goes if I wanted it on a plate I would've said. But you did you silly cucumber lol
james basically a one man army
11:46 me and my siblings sharing our food with each other 😂🤣
skill based matchmaking be like
I love the difference in skill! 2 against a whole team!
3 chefs? Nah only Andy
I worked in loads of kitchens but never in one so deliberately chaotic.
Nobody is safe from Gordons wrath, the difference between an amateur and a pro is if u let it get to u.
00:07 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
why does the narrator sound like roger craig smith
3v6 doesn't seem fair at all! It needed to be at LEAST 3v9, possibly 3v12!
7:18 "Two chicken two Wellington, two chicken two Wellington, one salmon three Wellington heard" Sous Chef James really left me out of words.
I guess Penn doesn't know Gentlemen remove their hats in restaurants, basically when indoors. LOL
That lady had the audacity to argue back about messing up her meat, slowing down the whole kitchen, and immediately start throwing people under the bus for being useless in the kitchen lol
Pink is in the kitchen
even as a badass chef they cant rest of their laurels you have to keep consistent and that's why I love gordon
Gordon cloned himself for this episode
@4:11 did Andi just taste the food and use the same spoon to keep cooking with?
Roe having a black jacket proves miracles can happen
This guy multitasking skill is insane
la tasha is so bad
👌
james vs. the world.😂
"One guy doing it all."  James sounds so happy, it's adorable 😂
We need this episode on server raw
Lol its like anime power scaling.
I don't like Roe at all
Top Ranked 😧 Top Pro league 😰 The Developer 💀  No way they are beating that team. Gordon really want to beat them with his own hands.
Funny how these guys  make frying scallops and tossing salad like it’s so complicated while moms in Asia doing a weekend lunch with 43 different ingredients work it like it’s a Friday.😂😂😂
I like how they say "meanwhile in the [other] kitchen" and Gordon's there as well.
3 chefs finish 5 tables ahead of 6 chefs, what does that tell you...  Im head chef in a local pub, not fancy food but decent home made dishes, and of course the usual pub grub stuff.   We easilly handle 60 covers a night with 2 chefs with no complaints. there is too much going on with too many people in hells kitchen, proven by the 2 chefs in the 2nd kitchen (gordon didnt appear to do any actual cooking)  When i done college we had 3 per section (starters, mains, desserts, garnish) and done 25-30 covers a night. it was ineficient, too much idle time, and trying to communicate between so many people is just crazy.  2 capable chefs together can work magic, speed and quality, add 2 more and you just do not get double the output.
I wish they did another round of this.
Who's going to win this? 1:23😂
man why is chef james catching flak, man is solo doing entrees while gordon and the woman unfucks the black team
I don't know why but the pan falling down cracks me up 7:45
Gordon riding James is too funny.
What iz a Michelin star
The 2 Chefs on Team Gordon were also his Sous Chefs on the show at one point.
This reminds me of my favorite sitcom Too Many Cooks!
watching 3 people handle half of that entire dining room, AND gordon still went over to work the pass in the blue kitchen, absolutely insane
Title should be Chef Jimmy against all of em😂
It’s beautiful watching people communicating and working like this
You see gordan smirk with chef andi asking chef jimmy for those chicken😂 Gordan trolling the bro
Steve Blake casually chilling with three chicks
Only 3 of us.. yeah but three pros one with 15 freakin stars was like having 10 lol. Theit efficiency and speed plus composure is miles ahead of the HK chefs.
Was there rrally three, ramsey was manning the orders and line more than cooking. The sous did most of it. 2 beat 7
“Will you share yours when you get it” “No”
😂Ramsay is terrifying in the kitchen 😂awesome to watch Hames is a killer chef
thumbs up for random penn jillette
Yo Chef James is a savage fr, dude was flyin.
Joël Robuchon – the chef with the most Michelin stars. He holds the number one spot among the top 10 chefs in the world, which makes him the best chef in the world according to the Michelin star rating. Although he died with “only” 28 stars, at one point, Robuchon was the proud owner of 32. He was also named “Chef of the Century” on numerous occasions.
Bryant at the end: "bwuuaahh 😮" hahaha
Reading these comments makes me feel hopeful for the future. God bless!
7:38 that smile at each other!  Would it be fine if I call them naughty rascals?
The fact that the red kitchen did so well despite Gordon constantly in the blue kitchen managing the them says a lot about the skill level of professional chefs
Santos saying its a rookie mistake that the scallops are rubbery but then puts too much pepper on the ceasar salad 😂😂😂
What season is this?
7:59  Bro really loves his work so much.
Gordon at the first😊 Gordon at the middle💀 Gordan at the end 👹
11:48 based
Why do transformers have mouths? Can’t they just produce audio from speakers?
4:10 Did she shake off the food on her spoon that she just put in her mouth back into the pan?
🔥
Gordan talkin like he did all the work 🤣
9:40 i hate people like that
You know your in trouble when Gordo comes on
14:26 Gordon looks like he fell asleep in the sun wearing ski goggles
Ngl I was expecting Scott to be summoned like in Kitchen Nightmares😂
And it was Bryant.  Whaaaa? Thank you.  s, Chef.
If this was real life Chef James would be like, "Yes Chef coming up Chef and with all due respect Chef, SMD"
At 4:11 Chef Andy tastes her risotto and then knocks the rest of it off back into the pan after tasting. Am i crazy or does that seem like it was a mistake?
I'd like to see another one of these with Christina and Jay . Bet they would rip through this service like it's nothing
I want to see more of Chef James // Chef Jimmy
I feel stressed just listening to gordon😂
De titel vind ik een beetje raar. Het lijkt net of Gordon alleen tegen de groep black jackets strijd. James en Andy zijn er ook nog.
Team work boy
The sheer difference is like night and day, red team gives important callouts on even the smallest things like "coming behind you, hands full" to make sure no one gets hurt while criss crossing one another. While Blue Team is floundering about, trying to move at the same pace, but being a bit disorganized because I notice the issues a lot of these teams have, is that they wait until it's too late to make a call out to one another. They try to act like a unified team, but you got the team captain on page 104, the sous chef is on page 68, and everyone else is between pages 1 and 40. So they're expecting each other to read one another's minds and it's not working and then they're getting mad at each other which slows things down more.  Communication is one of the biggest issues with most of these teams.
You can't cut a steak to see if it's done lol 😂it's by feel
Who else thinks this is underrated?
James basically did a 1v5 and won. Absolute Madman 🗿🔥
Am I the only one who noticed that she tapped the same spoon she used to taste the risotto back into the pan? 4:10
James looks like Johnny Sins 😂
No  one will  beat the Gordon team
Seen Sous Chef Scott and James on Kitchen Nightmares there absolutely awesome, and Andy also, Scott’s is Gordon’s protege which I didn’t realise.
Penn and gordon are the only people i know in that entire place.
7:45-7:46 that plate in the bottom right 🤣
lol
This show is so cringe
At 1:32 the lady said there better chefs combined one of them could take on the entire team
I wish Gordon and Producers had done this in later seasons (particularly 19-22) with Gordon, Christina and Jay vs the Black Jacket chefs AND Christina and Jay doing confessionals again for that service.
That whoooey wasn’t for her chef skills 😂
James is a beast
Regardless of the obvious scripting that Hell’s Kitchen does….there is no better feeling as a chef when you are just full exodia mode like James. You’re just pushing 9 entrees in perfect rhythm and you are basically unstoppable. Anyone who has ever worked in a kitchen knows that feeling and momentum
Me off a couple shots @ 5:07
I think they should bring this service challenge back with Gordon cooking against black jackets but with Christina and Jay!
I haven't watched HK for a long time and Ramsey has calmed down a lot!
why does gordon looks so young??
🇷🇺😙
Licho kebapa, polia purjeno kiufte, fani mandja sus sos, remi supa i giuvech, sladko cveti na chicho mi shterka mu.
NGL I've been to several of Gordon's restaurants and found them... wildly disappointing compared to his reputation. At his Mayfair location the food was so bad that it shocked me. He needs to do a kitchen nightmares series with his own restaurants. They also charged me like $7 for WATER. Absolutely laughable.
That season was boring af😂
9:59 EYYY YOWWWWW
123 Black !
James is a legend though. 9 entrees at once is wild
That really grosses me out. The one girl put the spoon in her mouth and put it back in the sauce
Gordon Ramsay creating a crisis in the red kitchen cuz there nothing to get angry about. :D
the food isn't the only thing that's been cooked, you can see where Ramsay's sunglasses were lol
Of course Steve Blake is there 😂🤣
chef Jimmy really shows the gap in skill. He's basically doing what the entire other team are doing.
That is amazing to watch Andi and James work like an efficient machine as a tram of two.
14:43 I love how Gordon says there were three of them…. When actually there were just 2 doing his work!!! 🤣🤣🤣 even more impressive
I would love to see the raw version of this dinner service.
Im imagining sonic being the narrator since thats all i hear
This is like the secret final boss fight you unlock after defeating the supposed final boss.
jimmy defo asked to do that on his own and they had fun with it
Because Men
I swear to god every camera change is in within 2 seconds every fking time.  ADHD show.
random cuts of massive dish stack. then none.  thanks for rec. me trash youtube.
to call yourself a chef while sending out raw food. yeah. so orchestrated.
how is gordon floating between 2 kitchens while cooking as well as keeping blue in check
4:11 so no one is questioning why she puts her mouth on the spoon then bangs the spoon on the saucepan causing the food she touched with her mouth to go back into the saucepan??
Dude, chef James is. A. Boss. Handling all the entrées solo, getting reamed by Ramsey, all with a grin on his face.  Goes to the confessional: "This is how I LOVE to work."
Man chef James is an absolute beast!
Why are the cooks dressed up like 2000s gangster.?
11:45
Coughing baby vs atomic bomb
4:11 did she just tasted and then tapped the same spoon in the pan ????
Actually they didn't get beat by the 3, it was only 1: chef James lol.
7:34 That's what she said
Going up against Gordon Ramsay, Andy, and James is the cooking equivalent of fighting a raid boss in an MMORPG.
Culinary Elite Trio VS Black Jacket Sextet.
Those beef wellingtons looked so good.  I've never had one before.
Steve blake nba player appears lol
When you order a steak and 8 different people touch it LOL
Ramsay, see you soon at Newport world and get criticized.
They have the worst team chef Ramsey has a lot of patience
jimmy vs black jackets
In all honesty, Gordon is running both passes.
Gordon, Andi and James all on the line is what I am here for!!
Hahaha...even Blake isnt safe from his wife immediately poking at his plate. 😂😂😂😂
‘You like the flavor?’ That is some grade-A natural conversation
Who tf is Steve Blake 😂😂
Chef james hard carrying the team man 😹
I feel embarrassed even commenting
makes me think how these are made 10:00, are they just picking one guy in the middle of this chaos and ask him if he has anything to say, then he stops everything he is doing and talks to the camera? or they just record reactions afterwards, either by remembering the moments or rewinding the tape and asking them if they want to add anything
The fact that Gordon could go from cooking, to calling orders, to plating , to shouting at chefs and catching mistakes for BOTH kitchens just proves how insanely talented he is.
That steak was so raw 😂
This ain't hell's kitchen this is food wars for real
Roe is the type of person you don't want near you anywhere in any aspect of your life.
"I don't want it in your hand i want it here. (Gordon and Andi smile at each other)😂
Would love to see raw version of it
By the time they get to black jackets are the people normally actually good enough to work in restaurants? like cooking multiple dishes at once. because it doesnt awlays feels like they highlight the chefs as being super good
7:10  my brain cannot remember that during the moment 🤣
This is like a raid team going up against three bosses at once
4:11 chef Andy eats and stirs from the same spoon
James solo-ing.
4:10 she tastes the risotto and then shakes off the remainder on the spoon back into the pan LOL
Briant couldn't believe he was being complimented at the end haha
When the final boss is your teacher
How tf you gon cut off like that 😭
7:36 love the little laugh Gordon and Andi had there
Santos is definitely not going to win. Lol
Meanwhile a random uncle plus 1 in a chinese restaurant can prepare a dish for 15 in 10 mins 😂
The one thing that I love about Ramsay is that he pushes for perfection. It doesn’t matter who you are.
Jimmy got that, all day.
This narrator sounds familiar
I would love to see the raw version of this dinner service.
Came for Gordon, stayed for James
chef james is super human and still gets chriped by gordon
that one Apex matchmaking after 1 win
"black jackets, u've earned them, now prove u have the right to wear them"...hwat?
Did Andy lick the spoon and use it again? Lol 😆
Love to see all the sous chefs in action especially Scott he’s underrated!
4:10 😳😳😳  test food with spoon and take food left in spoon back into pan?
1:07 my guy looks like that one bald chef from ratatouille
0:45 she looks at her like she knows she sold her soul.
anyone see the chest bump pce sign after the knuckle bump, awsome haha
Love seeing my man Steve Blake. Go Terps!  2002 feels so long ago :(
Isn't this completely fake?   Everybody here seems to assume it isn't but I am not sure why.
Gordon didn’t do much cooking tho
11:48"NO"😭😭😭🤏🏻
4:13 is she put back the spoon in the pan after tasted the dish...
9:22 nah hes evil for this
This had some serious Shokugeki vibes!
10:04 You were trying to do too much. Cooking and plating all of the entrées would be too much for anyone.
Is this food wars live action?
Gordon Ramsey was also running the evening shift at the Burger King around the corner...but that was easy stuff.
What’s the goggle tan lines on Gordon hahah
Imagine replying back with a "Your welcome chef" after being told you were the best team player during that service🤣🤣
Roe: "It's perfect Mid-rare"  It was, in fact, not mid-rare
Is that Roger Craig Smith???
I love to watch all Chef Ramsay shows. Chefs are under a lot of pressure. But with chef Gordon Ramsey I know everything is cooked to perfection and everything is clean and it’s delicious. Thank you Chef Ramsay
I'm so glad Sonic The Hedgehog was able to do the narration for this
Penn jumpscare
Talk about working under pressure!    Roe needs to relax, smoke a blunt, have a drink and or get laid.  Total spaz!
Why does it seem Gordon is a alot more calm in s13 compared to s20 and up
“Maybe you should share now” funny guy lol
5:57,  come on Santos!   You wouldn't eat that either.
Sous chef James looks like the guy from ratatouille . Dope
Even when Gordon’s smiling he’s still scary 😂

Love gordon ramsay!
Did Andy eat from the pan of the spoon and then tap it against the side of pan?!!  The risotto has Andy’s spit in it!!! (At the 4:07 mark)
i wish he did this more its so badass to see in action
Is the narrator the voice of Batman in Arkham Origins?? Sounds so familiar
I would like to talk to attorney matt murdock. Do you know when he will be available?
There's no way I could be a chef.
I thought he was gonna 1v6
Wow. I really didn't like season 1, but maybe future seasons would be worth giving a shot. This was great. And yeah, a smaller "understaffed" team that works really well together can definitely out perform a larger team that doesn't. I did concessions a few times as fundraising and in one of my groups, the stand was full to the brim, but we were struggling. The other stand only had maybe 6-8 of us, which was considered too small, but we got so good at working together that we nailed it
“There was ONE strong individual…and it was Bryant.”  “wheeeurghhh”
Id actually want to see Marco Pierre white and Gordon Ramsay work side by side against a team of black jackets, that'll be interesting
On the one hand, I'd love to work with Gordon Ramsey. On the other hand, I'd hate to work with Gordon Ramsey.
Thats what i call clickbait
I really want another of Sous Chefs vs contestants
This reminds me of Space Jam the black jackets r the all stars while Gordon's team is the monstars
Who won this season?
What a great Hell's Kitchen video!
James is the goat
i bet the 6 man team cant beat 1 asian uncle with a cigar
3v6? more like 2.2 v 6! gordon always have to help the other side
Wasnt even a 3v6 more like a 2.5 v 6 Gordon was jumping around the teams too
Andy tasting her food then tapping her spoon on the frying pan edge 🤢 4:11
7:40-7:47 you can clearly see Gordon laughing after repeatedly calling James for the chicken 😂 like his trying to make him feel like a black jacket
Oh boy Micheline stars.... so french food. Micheline stars mean nothing, the reason they are a thing is to 1: Get people to drive cars, so you need new  tires, and 2: Promote France.  Take a wild guess as to which country has the most micheline stars, given by the french tire company micheline... Nr 2 is Japan....only problem, all the restaurants are french. For the next countries with the most micheline stars, just look at what nations border France. (all conveniently  within driving distance of France)
I guess they film the little reaction shots after he whole service is over and they all know how it will end 😐
imo Bryant deserved to win this season. LaTasha was good, but more uneven than this dinner service.
8:20 if i got that Caesar salad id be so upset
14:41 pause
Weirdly 4:11 chef tasted the food and knocks it back in the pan with the same spoon lol
Spit in every food from all that yelling
I need to watch this service in the "Served Raw" format.
If you put it at 2x speed it literally sounds like hens clucking.
There is no way on this earth i could ever be a chef. I would have a heart attack every single day. No sir, i love those programmes but cheffing is not for me. I take my hat off to all chefs, especially those who have to work under GR. He takes no prisoners at all.
I could not be a chef. Never.
How much of this show is acted out???
Imagine the blacks would win this, then Gordon turns to Chef James, telling him "You were the best in the losing team. Nominate one of your team for elimination"  Then James tells Gordon he nominates him and Gordon has some self dialog about why he should stay in Hells Kitchen, but ultimately eliminates himself, walking out the door.
It was mostly a team of 2. Gordon was mostly busy yelling at the other team.
6:10 - black pepper on a lettuce and he crucifies him more than scallops being under done. Has to be the harshest most favouritism moments of the show
i know this is a very late comment, however I cant believe people go to HK for 3 pieces of depressed seasoned lettuce and a baby tomato. (tis is joke please dont get offended)
I wouldn't pay that amount to see the chefs constantly talking and not even wearing the mouth shield!
Love this episode so peaceful
sad part is, he gave the Black jackets a break by only requiring them to run the kitchen for half the dining room on their first go.
2 vs 6 lol
What’s Omaha steak doing at Hells Kitchen? Eating someone else’s steak?
😂😂 a lil under had me 😅 you know huh?
11:42 the whole conversation is just funny
Just pointing out how Gordon is expediting for both kitchens so it's really a 2v6. Just shows how huge the gap in experience and skill is.
13:35 “Can we finish these tables together??”  “YES CHEF!”  **overlapping chatter while he walks away shaking his head** 😅
chef bryant wasn’t expecting that fr
Not that I care about what Andi did in 4:11, but isn't that bad practice that Gordon has blasted someone before for doing the same thing?
The lady on Ramsey team used a spoon to taste and then banged it on pan to remove excess!!¡ yuck and she wrong for that
imagine the served raw of this episode
11:40  that's siblings talk😂😂😂
The fact that the voice of Sonic narrates Hell's Kitchen makes me chuckle.
The very definition of this one was over before it began
Do yall know the season and episode?
This is kinda the literal meaning of FINAL BOSS stage
“I can share mine with you” “Yeah” “Will you share with me when you get it?” “No.”
Why anyone works in a kitchen is beyond me
Wwwhhhaaaarrrrrr 😳
Sometimes ramsay do bully individual who he dont like santos did one mistake and was roasted for it when natasha literally gave raw lobster cooked to f scallops ....and row raw meat ...
Final table TI
Sharpen blades and clean pans and stove
how tf did la tasha win
Profanity is the recourse of a weak mind.
Meanwhile, one uncle in a Chinese restaurant is cooking 50 dishes to perfection by himself
these black jackets 😂😂😂
The is like seeing the gap between elite High School recruits & NBA players
The music is actively ruining the video. I hate American TV shows.
6:00 Santos calling out the other chef for overcooking the scallops as a "rookie mistake" and 10 seconds later Gordon calls him over to yell at him on adding black pepper to the salad, a basic mistake as Gordon said.
Why haven't they done 4his agin.
Triple Trouble but it's Hell's Kitchen
where is jp?
Loved the grandpa asking to share and then saying he aint gonna share his share when he gets it Absolutely hilarious
In valorant we call this 3 radiants vs 5 gold players
You can tell that chefs andy, scott and gordan are masters at their craft.  One thing that's fascinating about watching a master at work is that they dont appear stressed while doing the task, if anything theyre more relaxed than normal. They're performing tasks they've done right thousands of times, and they have full confidence in their own abilities.  You can also tell they're all passionate about cooking as well, because they express excitement and regard what most woul consider a stressful ordeal as "fun"
The guy saying he won't share his food 😂😂
You busy i do it
come here:P i got 2  unhappy costummers,so get organized.THanks you for the constructive comment chef that makes a lot of sense hahaa
11:46 that commentary with Bruce Simons arguing about food was hilarious. Just adds to making this show entertaining 😂
people forget why Gordon Ramsay pushes people is because he knows they have potential.
How does gordan ramsay not burn out?
At 4:10, Andi, tasted the food, then tap the food off her tasting spoon back in the pan.  And she's the dream team?
This was the season where Gordon was the least angry there were times where he was complimenting the contestants and wasn’t as angry when there were mistakes he just sounded disappointed
Awesome how chef Ramsey can manage 2 groups like that simultaneously…
gordon giving out orders and feedback in the blue kitchen while also cooking in the red kitchen like how even
3 of us? It was 2.5 at best Gordon was too busy yelling at the other team
I just love Gordon, not only he is a fantastic master of culinary art, but he also has a kind heart and is willing to help others.  That's a good quality that makes me admire him and see him as a hero.
Gordon Ramsay is such a legend!
it wasn't even 6 on 3 it was six on 2 lol
11:45 "Maybe you should share it." "Ok, would you share yours with me when you get it?" "No."
Oi man, the yelling from Gordon really doesn't seem necessary or to help.
Basically 6v2
but, is the waiter italian?😂
No way they got Johnny Sins
Gordon’s face be cyclist sunburnt. Forehead red, around the eyes pale (sunglasses), rest of the face red.
And I know he’s a master chef but if he’s saying il take anything isn’t good tbh
Unlike Joel Robuchon with 31 Michelin stars before he passed away.
"oh 15 Michelin stars, i wonder who it could be" 😂 they knew immediately lol
What an ego on that dude!
Bruh, this was too easy for James and Andi...they should do this again but against the dream team of former contestants, like Dave + Rock + Christina.
Too many women and so much drama. Sorry for Santos.
Roe on the Meat Station , was just .. ugh !! 😫. Like , why doesn't she understand that her steak special was raw !?. She said that the meat station was her “ baby” but honestly I think her worst performances come when she’s on Meat . And also , If Anton from season 12 watched this episode, then he would understand why Chef Andi is one of Chef Ramseys trusted sous chefs along with James! 😂. They did a phenomenal job! 😊❤
I want to see the blue kitchen go against Gordon Ramsay alone
Gordon and his team are busting out all of their orders while having only three people, one of them being gordon on the blue sides hot plate at the same time. Crazy
4:11 SHE DID........
11:42 "maybe you should share" "i will be happy to share" "maybe you should share now" "will you share when yours come?"  "NO"🤣🤣🤣
i love the pressure
first of all.. after 20 years, are you really actually surprised about anything ? also.. chef Andi could make a dead man come ... yowza..
The Avengers vs. Thanos, Galactus, and Dr, Doom
Chef itzmee? Sounds like a dumb name
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
Am glad that Chef Ramsay is in the competition Because we get to see the other side of him
11:42 Funniest one yet, the selfishness is on mount top point
1990’s Boiling Point Gordon was much terrifying.  I followed that whole thing while I spent time in England.  Also, I’m happy he has mellowed out now but keeps up the pressure.
You can tell that chefs andy, scott and gordan are masters at their craft.  One thing that's fascinating about watching a master at work is that they dont appear stressed while doing the task, if anything theyre more relaxed than normal. They're performing tasks they've done right thousands of times, and they have full confidence in their own abilities.  You can also tell they're all passionate about cooking as well, because they express excitement and regard what most woul consider a stressful ordeal as "fun"
Gordon was like, " My best three against your six lol."
I thought it was waiting for chef Itsme to come out a 1:20, not gonna lie...
I wonder if those rich people would eat there knowing raw hands are touching all your food without gloves .
umm did she just taste from the spoon and put it back in the pan 0_o
How can you mess up scallops
👍
My half brother is about 10 yrs older than me, and spent a considerable about of time working as a chef.  He told me a piece of advice about working in a kitchen....don't, it's just as terrible as you'd imagine.
Where is Jean Phillipe??
I love how the sous chefs also get the exact same Gordon Ramsey treatment
Chef Ramsey team was just all business
11:46 the guy without his food is so me
@9:44 😂
11:42 "No❤" 😂 Amazing customers
LOL CHEF JIMMY!
CHEF ANDI IS HILARIOUS!
I wonder how he met Andy if she like applied randomly shes in charge of everything
James carrying
That music has got to stop! Too distracting!
Thx
one more point, at the end he said his team of 3 finished earlier than the team of 6. But thats because they do this as a profession. Imagine 3 world class golfers v 6 other decent golfers, how is it a surprise if the professionals win?
Chef James - 🤓
11:38 The Best customer dialog exchange!😂
This show makes me respect good chefs... and while I enjoy cooking am so glad I never became one... not to mention chefs are SO underpaid!!!
I hate people eating out of my plate.
I know it’s for fun but I find it hard to believe the contestants didn’t know this was going to happen. Wouldn’t they have had to prep both kitchens by that point?
How ironic roe is on beef 😂😂 (roe in mandarin means beef)
That woman chef seriously scared me more than Gordon.
Does Chef Ramsay have a sunburn on his face??
Bryant saying whatttt😂
i dunno. how do u be a chef if u cant tell if the scallops or lobsters are raw or not and does it have to be so toxic
4:07 anybody saw that chef on gordon ramsay's team tasting the dish with a spoon and then proceed to put the remaning food from the spoon into the pan????🤮
Young(er) Gordon
DAM!
Why did the chicken cross the kitchen? 'Cause it was raw.  😂
At 4:10 gordons chef tatstes food and then knocks remainder of spoons content back in pan  Probally prechewing it to aid in customer digestion
What season and episode is this please
So no one recognizes Steve Blake from the 2009-2010 Lakers walking in as the first customer
pls expain how there 2 of gordon
this is my guilty pleasure, to watch this nonsense
4:10 I saw that 👀
he could have given a better intro to himself  "15+ Michelin stars, trained under Marco Pierre white, and ran a fairly famous TV show or 2"
The guy at the end couldn’t believe Ramsay’s complement 😂😂
Chef James is the man
Chef James cooked like 9 entrées by himself while a team of black jackets were still struggling on appetizers lol
This is why hospitality is the worst industry.
Chef James is a monster throwing it down in the kitchen.
Chef Andy tastes the Risotto with a spoon. Bangs whats left on the spoon back into the pan😮
Looks like Gastro pub food
Lol they're clapping for their executioners
It seems my recommendations have reached another hells kitchen era, im fine this
2:15 U don't have a choice this isn't about beating them, it's about being able to maintain a pace that nearly matches them as they can EASILY outperform all 6 of them
We need an episode of them turning the frozen dog food he's selling at Walmart into something edible.
4:13 looks like emenuim if he was a female
Imagine going to Hells Kitchen and ordering the Cesar Salad
I’ll share mine rn  Will you share later?  ….nO?
man in blue suit: I be happy to share you this. man in grey suit: maybe we share it now. man in blue suit: will you share your meat after you get it? man in grey suit: No.😂 11:40
No matter who you are, when you work in the culinary or baking world, that white jacket gets put on- game time
Gordon was cooking while being in charge of the other kitchen, what a monster
Sad thing is: I've been to Gordon's Ramsay Burger in Vegas. Hamburger tasted of nothing but butter, no seasoning, they use Soybean oil just like McDonald's. McDonald's has more flavor! The fries were good, though  Burger was totally not worth my $17 + $12 parking ticket. Never again
bruce simon at 11:45 🤣🤣
The ultimate boss fight😂
Maybe you should share now.  Will you share when yours comes? No. 😂😂😂
who tf is steve blake
Andy is a dime❤
"Will you share yours with me when you get it?"  "No." 😂
4:12 Andy puts spoon in mouth and dumps rest back in risotto 😮
Sometimes less is more..
Air date: December 10, 2014
I love when Chef Andy put her spoon in the cooking risotto to taste it, took a small bite then drummed her spoon on the risotto pan, throwing her uneaten bits back into the pan. How about berating one of your protoges  for this despicable food safety violation Chef Ramsey?
Man, I hope they do this in S22 with Chef Jason and Christina
I’d forget the orders immediately. 😅😂
Andi eats from a spoon, and then shakes off the remainder of the food back into the pan at 4:10 😮
I want to eat beef wellingtons now
The professional girl chief she tasted the first dish but then put the rest back in the pan😷
Anyone know what season this is?
actually.. i think that female chef andy looked annoyed and miserable... not excited at all.
Will you share yours with me? 👉👈. No.
Always funny being reminded of what Penn used to look like.
I wish the dinner crowd wasn't so obvious with the staged complaints. You're at a reality show restaurant. No way you would expect perfect, fast service.
This lobster is raw!
I thought they would put Roe on fish not meat 😂
maybe you should share now...hahaha give that man his steak!
I enjoyed watching this video
This feels like one of the worse black jacket teams
Andi and James are like cooking terminators; operating at peak efficiency
Silly nonsense lol "yes chef" lol all they are really doing at the end of the day is cooking food..
That one dude really went: You should share your food with me right now. But said no when asked if he would share his food when it came. 🤨 Hahahaha No.
What's the point of comparing 3 ALL STAR chefs beating 6 NOOBS?   Did anyone expect anything different?
Did no one catch the chef tasting the food and hitting the spoon back on the bowl at 4:15???
LOVE YOU BTS ARMY LOVE YOU JIUNGOKOOK JIMIN SUGA RM JHOPE JIN taehyung LOVE YOU too ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘 ❤️ 😍 💖
Anyone else catch the chef sample her food then shake the same spoon back into the pan …the SAME pan she will be serving the food from? No ma’am!!!
Imagine if Gordon said the fourth chef is Marco Pierre White 😅
I love pepper on salad
they have no idea who any of them are
Pros vs. Joes - Kitchen Edition
James literally doing everything 🤣
11:42 will you share yours with me? NO 😂😂😂 had me rolling
Jajaja
i miss mary anne
congrats for the new born baby ❤❤ god bless 🙌 🙏 💖
that man steve blake got 3 shorties🤣🤣🤣
this was so fun to watch !! (what season is this and can they do this all the time )😊
At 4:11 Andi eats with spoon and shakes the left overs into the pan?
❤❤❤❤❤
Calm dsn itz only food not a fire station
Whole thing is designed to be a failure: amateur home cooks, too many cooks in the kitchen, no synergy. Still confused as to why people watch it
Santos for me is the stronger chef he helped everyone and instead of saving him when he was helping everyone they let him take that from Gordon
Trolling at its finest. Whoop whoop GR!
This is so funny Costumers waiting over 20 Minutes for Food   Gordon: hey Guys all of you come over here😂
Culinary Boss Battle
The random Steve Blake appearance. Lol
THE DREAM TEAM❤
I like how they keep asking where’s the food, like doing that will speed time up😂
god i almost forgot how cancer the editing is
Boss too hard. Pls nerf
Bro talking about bad scallops bro couldn’t make a salad
Imagine being a Michelin star chef and knowing you're completely in a classroom with GR. I love this.
🎉congratulations on your new addition Gordon
They should have done this every season after 😊
The music gets so old and annoying. You guys need different music for this show.
wow Gordon is running both kitchens baically lol
Andi looks like a capital B !!!!!
At the end, Chef James was eliminated.
4:16 Andi licks the spoon, hits it on the rim and keeps cooking with it 💀
Bring in Marco, put him on the other team and then you have an actual rating bonanza. (Hint: You don't have the budget but it would break records)
I just realized they mess up a max of a couple dishes and get everything else right. there's 100 there.
i knew someone who cooked under gordon and she said and sorry if this ruins anything for anyone but he is such a sweetheart that this attitude you see on tv is just for tv for ratings... he truly is the masterchef
Am I trippin or did Andy legit just slurp some risotto off the spoon and then mix up her saliva with the rest? 💀😬 4:10
“And there was one strong individual…” “ And it was Bryant!”  Bryant: “wUuuut”😟😳👴
12:02
I mean
'WHERES THE WINGMAT'😂 12:03
YASSS I NEEDED THIS
So 4:11 Andy literally ate from the spoon and out it back in the pan…
Ramsay: The third chef is me. Final boss music starts
This conversation killed me 😂 “Maybe you could share.”  “I’d be happy to share with you.”  “Maybe you should share now.”  “Okay will you share yours with me when you get it?”  *NO*
I like how Hell’s Kitchen is still trending to this day
Thought that lady was sydney for a sec
😂😂 whhaaaa
WHERES MY BABY BOY JON FLIEP?!
iv you r a little kid don’t wche th
CHEF JAMES MESSED UP BY SEASONING THE SCALLOPS TO EARLY, AND RAMSAY DID NOT YELL AT HIM. ROOKIE MISTAKE CHEF JAMES
I’d love to see an uncut version of this service
7:50 someone messed up on the audio editing pretty badly there
4:10 Ooo girl don't you know better?
Kinda wanna see they try this again in current or next season
45 dollars on lobster tail-
"I don't want it in your hand, I want it here!"  Excuse me, Gordon, but it's not going to just float to you!
La Tasha had no business  winning the season she just talked a lot of BS to make it seem like shes this culinary mastermind. Jennifer was a much better leader and you got to really see it was just for fame and clout when Tasha didnt even take the actual job after the show, she just bounced and thought she could use the publicity to promote her own business.
Awsome!
I wish Gordon and his sous chefs did this alot more
Chef Gordon ain’t cooking nothing though it’s the chefs that’s under him he just doing what he normally does which is yell 🤦🏾‍♀️
7:28
What does "Him & Hers" beef wellington mean?
Clickbait again :) C'mon, man! I did watch from season 1 to season 17 :D I know every moment
6 people trying to all be head chef. With Gordon, they know who is head. You can't function unless you know how to listen and give direction. If no one can take charge and make everyone listen, the kitchen will always be ran poorly.
3:52  7:10  9:43
When he says 15 Michelin stars it can only be him or his mentor, only 2 people to have so many, I believe his mentor has close to 40
I’d love to see the raw footage of this service.
Ramsay and Andi, grinning at each other when he’s giving James a hard time 😂😂😂
11:40 will you share with me. NO
Imagine expecting people to do their jobs with integrity, accuracy, precision, professionalism, pride, and competency. It's a REALLY weird, super "out there" request, I know. But... uhhh, yeah, it'd be pretty cool if the majority of people actually did that. Instead, it's like... what... maybe 1% of people?! :/ It's embarrassing.
We can not let them beat us? They can beat you blindfolded .
The first chef, Andi, I think her name was, does not look happy to be there.
Gordon’s sunburn in this is hilarious 😂
No MSG😢
Happy Birthday Gordon 🎂🎉🎉🌠🌠🌠
7:33 i love this part, the way both him and andi look at eachother and smirk, you can just tell they work like well oiled gears
So funny the sous chefs talking to the camera like normal people
Watching 2 chefs who work directly under Gordon Ramsay makes you realize how far in scale they are compared to black jackets.
its not exacly suprising yhay gordons team won...    some of these are amateur chefs, they should have goten praise for gettting so close actually
Not to break away from the show. But is that Rodger Craig Smith narrating the show?
James casually rattles off an order includes five Wellington.  I don't know about anybody else, but in the kitchen, I wouldn't mess with Andi.
For anyone wondering why Gordon calls James “Jimmy” it’s to do with his Scottish background, close male friends are called Jimmy (and apparently women aswell!) (Knew about this from “Gordon, Gino and fred tv show, on YouTube it’s “the best of the highlands) something like that!
They should do this in the current season with Christina and Jay
Happy Birthday, Chef Ramsay!
Anybody else see Chef Andi make that booboo @4:11 ?
If they included Sous Chef Scott and Mary Ann, the black jackets in Season 13 would've been decimated.
Season 13 Black Jacket = The Most forgettable Black Jacket in Hell's Kitchen history ever.   Basically, everyone in Season 13 is forgettable except Sterling. I even forgot Roe in Season 18 was from Season 13.
Did any take a bite and dump the leftover on the spoon back into the pan 4:14
Chef Ramsay is one of my favorite people in this life.
Is there anymore uncut scenes that could be released?
Is sonic the hedgehog narrating or something I swear
4:10 She tasted the dish and then tapped the spoon on the edge of the pan before discarding it!  And she's a top chef?  Ramsay would have ripped any one of the contestants if he caught them doing that!
LOL the whole exchange at 11:42 is EXACTLY what my sister and I would say to each other in this exact situation!!!! "maybe you could share." "I'd be happy to share with you." "maybe you should share now." "yeah but will you share with me when you get it?" "no." 🤣🤣🤣🤣
If its not burnt its raw oml😂😂😂
really wish they would bring this back
Bruh James basically beat the the black team by himself 😂😂😂😂
Gordon was trying so hard to be nice😂
they shoulda known he was throwing himself in: look how big he's smiling.  EAR to EAR
This is like Po vs. Master Shifu and Master Oogway
Nailed? James, my boy, that meat is raw
Andi puts the spoon in her mouth and then taps the remaining risotto and sauce back into the frying pan.  4:09
I want more hell’s kitchen RAW!
I would LOVE to see Hell's Kitchen do this again, imagine Chef Ramsay with Christina and Jason against the Black Jackets.
4:11 did Chef Andy just do what I think she did?
All these people got to be Gordon's close friends and relatives. Because I don't think sane people in the general public would eat food that's been touched by several hands like this.
"it's not even my station!" well nah duh, so do as she says
Minute 4:10 Andy made a big mistake.she tasted the food and put it back in the pan. Not that I would mind cause I'm a man and she's very pretty but there's people that would be upset.
“Maybe we should share” “well can I get some of yours when you get it” “NO”
It would be awesome if they did this again with Christina and Jason
The pan XD 7:42
❤ 13:35
It would be dope to have Christina and Andi for the red/blue teams as sous chefs for a season.
Yooo blazers legend Steve Blake
Gordon had Johnny Sins on his team 🥶
Your madtradi put thumbs on plate a no go if he was taught right dude. Where's jaun phillip he knows what he's doing can't get staff now awadays
The chick on meat was killing them 😂😂
Id love to see this episode as a Served Raw episode
Chef James just cooking all the entrees by himself and still maintaining a positive attitude while getting grilled was pretty fun to see
Happy birthday chef
7:48  Love Andi joking hahah
I would love to see Gordon do this again with Christina and Jay.
The war of kitchen.👨‍🍳👩‍🍳🧑‍🍳🪖
Ew andi tasted the risotto then ckeaned it off on the pan eww 😒
Chef Gordon and chef Rush vs the other team
"Maybe you should share now" "Will you share yours when you get it?" "No"
Honestly it could’ve just been Gordon up against all of them and it probably would’ve still been tough
Could you share? Yes. Share now? Will you share when you get yours? No.
Andy is so cringe ... like it aint that serious lol
Roe thought Gordon was talking about her being the only strong chef when he was talking about Bryant. That was just terrific!
The way Gordon joked and smiled at Andy at 7:38 is literally so adorable I keep repeating it
I hate when they upload a random episode that has nothing to do with the current season that they’re showing
Happy birthday chef Ramsey !!!!
This show is so bad. Gordon, you could have done so much better.
Why would you ever choose the other team's menu?
Bryant being shocked was funny ngl😂❤
11:39 this is how 99% of all sibling fights start
What if Gordon Ramsay cursed himself out?
“Okay will you share yours with me when you get it?”……… “No”😂
where is Christina in this!!??  I have a crush on Christina.
9:05 “the black team” 💀
Is this in vegas at caesars palace?
Happy birthday Gordon
Bring Chef Andy back 👩‍🍳
Anyone else think they should do this more often? It’s really fun seeing the sous chefs get some airtime for once and it’s extra fun seeing the contrast of the black jackets struggling vs. Ramsay’s chefs breezing through
It took two and a half premium chefs to beat a whole team of 6 chefs. Unfu**ing believable!
Wow......as if we haven't seen this before 🙄
Gordon Ramsay cooks against the chefs in hell's kitchen round 2 please upload another video
Soup
I feel like it's the narrator controlling the videos and the titles.
looks intresting
Why do I love watching chefs stress so much 😂
Gordon could do an entire dinner service by himself.
4:10 Gordon got mad at another chef for doing this before
If Ramsey could switch from food to bullets😂 he'd make an awesome general drill Sargent. ".22's are the appetizer! Where's the.556 and the artillery are already sent!?!? Look! We've got 2 migs. Where are our f-18's? THAT'S A WARTHOG YOU IDIOT!"
7:46 Dung!
6v3 and the 3 finished 5 tables ahead. ouch...lol
I bet roe smells like onions and jarred garlic
Bryant was robbed!
Legend has it Roe is still basting that chicken.
Did Andi just eat something from a spoon and then tapped the spoon on the pan that has food for the dinner tables at 4:10?
4:11 she took a bite and then put it back in the pan 😂😂😂😂
Chef Ramsay knows who he is. He can speak for himself 🔥🍴
This season was so bad I quit the show for a few seasons. Aside from Sterling and to a lesser degree Frank, every single other chef is just meh. No real likable characters in the black jacket either. Just degrees of unlikable to forgettable.  Also the Ashley elimination is an all-time horrible elimination decision from Gordo
Undisputed best content that comes out of Hells Kitchen
Love seeing the sous chefs take centre stage with Gordon. Shows you how talented they are.
Why don't you Upload more Serve it Raw episodes?
Ramsay is obviously not doing this because you can clearly see the mistakes, but it's funny to imagine Ramsay secretly wanting to win and just sending back everything the black jackets cooked.
The editing make me laugh when one talking smack about one person then end up fing up themselves.
Any chance of some full seasons and episodes?
Hopefully there would be another season of the raw service
He should have all the sous chefs including the former ones back for a challenge against black jackets.
I love how the Sous chefs had their own confessionals. Wish it was a permanent thing.
I wish the sous chefs had confessionals throughout the series. It would be cool to see their thoughts and giving Ramsay thoughts on who to eliminate.
James getting grilled by Gordon Ramsay 😂😂 Now he knows how the contestants felt cooking in the kitchen.
Why are we back to this season? This season already has soooo many videos; including of this exact service.
I wonder if Chef James was ever given the nicknames Shredder or Uncle Phil?
imagine booking the red kitchen for that night to find out gordon and the sous chefs are solely gonna be cooking there that night. i would die of happiness.
3 min ago and very early
The funniest part was the Sous Chefs getting confessionals. It makes them feel like actual contestants.
I find it so amazing that Gordon is so kind and sounds so proud of his sous chefs even though he is considered the best chef in the world by millions and millions
Hi
I can’t believe I’ve never seen this clip before 😭
So early
Yo
