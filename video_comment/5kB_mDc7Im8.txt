6:54 "I'M SPARTACUS" moment right here.
14:39 if you hid further in the room you wouldve won
shit is so staged
In Indian movies, the hero never dies, nor does he fail in any mission. Likewise, these cheap YouTubers are just there to glorify American military men, portraying them like the unreal heroes of Indian movies. They had to make the soldiers win at any cost.
Hello
Mister beas de temu
"SOLDIER. I didn't see you at camouflage training today." "Thank you sir."
STFU STFU N PUT MORE POPCORN JUST KEEP TALKING 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬Y IS SHE DINGY THEY'RE LOOKING EVERYWHERE
ese es tu entrenador
these just seem fake I would love to see a genuine one.
I'll just bring a heat sensor.. game over 😂😂😂
Me imagine que podrian ocupar fuerza bruta, con GASES LACRIMOGENOS...no podran respirar o estornudaran...
0:19" El de polera violeta con el "caballito" Alpha se robo la PELICULA
Y'all lost  B'cause y'all didn't move from the spot that you were at I would have found an exit door which every movie theater has and went outside and came back in as the clock expired
Ok now I'm pretty sure I'm gonna have some weird dreams.
Come on man! Osama tried and lost. You really expected to win against the US Military guys?
Make more soundtracks
Bro are you arrested
O GORDO tem personal trainer????? Tão fake como o prsonal ser militar... que vídeo estupido e sem jeito nenhum , o que estraga é a encenação mal feita, que coisa horrorosa..!! Mas como foi feito por Americanos tem desculpa são BURROS por natureza mesmo..!!
Que coisa tão falsa e tão encenada..!! Nem uma criança de 5 anos, tirando as americanas iam acreditar numa porcaria destas..!!
Se disfrazó del príncipe de shrek.Buen camuflaje😅
You talked way too much during your hiding experience. (USAF Retired).
All the talking gets on my nerves! Just show your facial expressions and do a voice-over. How you going to be hiding chatting away when they're right next to you?! I'm like, if I were doing this I'd have snacked someone in the mouth by now for keeping talking.
🥱 Utter BS!
😂 Night vision goggles for a movie theatre 🎭
Hey bro isn’t this your personal trainer 😂
Matthew.    Le.   Puedes.   Preguntarle.   A.   Tu.    Ermana.    Si.  Quiere.  Reser.   Mi.    Novia
Greta Thunberg and that dude must go to the same hair stylist.
US military! Thats butter 😂😂😂
Very creative. Good video
US Military ❤
Kiss
I want your shirt Matthew
You should have given them $500 cuz they found you in the last 5minutes. It must be:  First 20mins = $5000 Last 5minutes = $500
You all look annoying
Why does none of this seem legit.. it feels like am watching Drake and Josh on some kids network following some script. defo the last video after being the first to watch from this channel lol
I am a pro mat
This gave me cancer
So fake 😂
It's cotton
That's not cotton candy
Y recuerden niños, al final los encontraron de forma tan extrañamente conveniente porque el ejercito no puede verse tan estúpido como para dejarse ganar por un youtuber
😅
Is the military guy you personally trainer to
Imagine watching chicken jockey in that movie theater 💀
That military guy is fineeee
Vine de tik tok xd
Every time the videos occur about camouflage they all ensure that they get caught in the end. It actually causes it to get boring at this point because you basically know that they will all get caught and won’t possibly win.
Isn’t one the military guys Matt’s trainer😂
No esta mal mister Best d Temu 😂😂😂
7:15 sentí tencion
plot twist they pulled up the popcorn bucket really hard and it snaps his neck and he dies
Very good training session for the military.
Estupidos con dinero

A decent search team would have been able to quickly detect the hidden room/theater.  Coast Guard boarding teams are specially trained to detect hidden spaces on vessels.  Determine your entire search area then figure out what's missing.
Esse cara fala demais ,tem ficar queto irmão.
Search case code go down the croak I will pray, right
Team army men not mathu
So arrogant.  "We have seen all their videos and we know their tricks"   A soldier should never assume they know all.  Do they really need drones and tear gas to find them. Lol
Schön gemacht. Ihr hättet gewinnen können wenn ihr gerannt seit. Aber da die euch im Versteckt gefunden habt , habt ihr lieber entschieden die gewinnen zu lassen was das ganze ein schöneren flair gegeben hat. Gefällt mir dafür ein dickes Like. Grüße aus Deutschland

What does it matter if it’s scripted or not if it’s entertaining?
Ya esta saliendo la versión pirate de Mrbeast😂😂😂
Una copia de Mr beast
In these videos the people hiding always give themselves away by talking! Also, his hair was too obvious in the popcorn bucket but, they still missed him *and* ate popcorn from the bucket! 🤦🏼‍♀️

Dude, don’t just stay in there as they’re about to like destroy the wall run back into the theater. You can hide there for the rest of the time and unless they find you.
Didn’t know your trainer worked for the military
Isn’t the black militiaman your personal trainer? Your not slick and we’re not slow
Good day. I am a professional at hiding from the police. One search lasted 3 days in the snow. With copter and drones four surrounding county's several witnesses updating my location. At one point I walked right by them. Ended up surrendering. Let me know if your up for a challenge.
Love it❤❤❤❤❤❤
That a good hiding spot .
The military people are his trainer and his friend.
0:29 they’re gonna be here any minute!!!! Let’s got a hole in the seat and turn myself into popcorn and it’s gonna take hours😂

matthew can make a giant optimus  prime and megatron for transformers 40th anniversary
Such horrable acting but at least you managed to get a sponsor for a spongebob game, a plug for the movie theater, and some military propaganda all in one video. Good work

Avoid excessive screen time to prevent blindness increased screen time leads to the myopia pandemic. 4. Use Rollens sunglasses when outside; consider the orange-tinted "Gold Rollens." Can put multiple overlapping so can use 2 at same time for more protection. 5. Never stare at the sun to avoid retinal detachment and eye damage. 6.

MUFFS!   Screenwriting Propaganda: My screenwriting teacher said that if we only remember one thing from his class, it’s that everything is propaganda. But to me, if it’s good, it’s not propaganda; it’s memorable and impactful.   Shat faced controversy when he was accused of druging, stranglng, drownig, and cremating his wife. He used her past struggles with alcohol as an excuse. Do some blame his actions on the stress from the moon landing conspiracy and his tinnitus from a Star Trek accident, for which he was a spokesperson?

Bro is running out of ideas💀

U are going to loose me but i am sorry- dont copy thumbnails
Bro like why do you copy
Yay! He chose the Sonic movie 3 poster for his hiding spot! I am very hyped for that movie😆
Stolen valor???
😮
Im calling BS. this is all staged! there is no way the military didn't notice the movie room light above the movie room door that was still there after they put the wall up! it looks so painfully obvious. Mathews videos were way better before he started going viral and staging his videos. poor kid needs a new hairstyle and a personality.
