This is getting tired.
7:34 why no :(
You won a chance to sponsor us is a crazy statement lol.
Tacoing a sandwich is the most efficient way of shoving food down your gullet.
Poop vs fart
no surprises here...
,Opinion, opinion opinion
Current JJs employee. Those are horrifically made.
Link's hair... he's got the Beethoven thing going on. I love it.
these are my favourite episodes
Your hypothesis is gey
I tried them both for the first time two weeks ago, Jersey Mike’s is much more quality imo.
The love for jersey mikes is why I trust rhett and link
The classroom isn’t true about the training at Jersey mikes. I worked for them for about 4 years and did a lot of the new hire training. I will say it is about 4 weeks worth of training including having a test on how to top the sandwich
When are these guys funny
TOGOS has the best sandwich over all of  them
these guys sucking.
Jersey Mikes. Hands down. No contest
LINK's fear of tomatoes = 🥺🥺😳😳😱😱😱
Jersey Mike’s hands down
Love watching these as a non-American cus I don’t have an opinion on either
Do capriottis vs jersey Mikes I think it’ll be closer
14:05 hahahahahahahahaha
Jersey Mike's chipotle chicken is delicious as well. 😋
Iv never had eaither but jersey mikes looks better
Great video but u should have tried the Philly cheese steak from jersey mikes. Mmm
🤣🤣
Ftr. I was referring to rhetts whining.
honestly from the apperence alone JM's wins hands down not sure about the taste tho since wi never had JJ
Jersey Mikes
Jersey Mikes has that wonderful cherry pepper relish for the win.
Jersey Mike's hands down!  The only chain sandwich we eat.
JJ’s Italian Nightclub is my fav!
Should have done FireHouse instead of JJ. I walked into this episode already knowing the outcome
I knew this was going to be a slaughter the moment I saw Jersey Mike's going up against anyone besides Jersey Mike's.
i want jersy mikes in canada
every time Link takes a bite of food on this show it looks like he is trying to remember how to eat food, it's hilarious
Appreciation for Rhett’s lovely button up ❤️
as a displaced NYer. Jersey mikes is the closest thing you can get to real deli
It was nice of you guys to spend $30k on this video
Publix
I really like the club lulu, idk who they had making theirs😂
>:(
You can tell how much better the Jersey Mike's employees are.
Do Food Feuds: Circle K vs 7-Eleven!!
Link needed Better Help for that rant lmao
This was posted on my b-day
Penn Station or Firehouse over these two restaurants.
ive never agreed with link more on anything than that rant towards the end
First video I ever contemplated on disliking 😪
XDDD "How might you NOT make a taco?" -Link
Put the toppings on first. Just saying.
Should've eaten Jjs first then score it
You need to get all the ingredients in every bite.
Idk Understand This Episode Cause In The Beginning They Literally Said They Like Jersey Mikes Better Than Any Other Sandwich Place. Smh
"That's Too Much Tuna!!!"
Jersey Mike's!!!
No steak and cheese?!
The thing that amazes me about Jersey Mike’s is the consistency. No matter which store I go to, it’s good and fast
Just adding to the credibility of these two amazing humans we love, Rhett and Link. I went Zip Lining here in Northern California where I live (Sonoma Zipline Adventures) and one of our guides was from Cary, NC. I asked if he knew of Rhett and Link. He said one of his best friends is Rhett's son, Locke. He volunteered that these two dudes, Rhett and Link, are the real deal. He said they're truly good people, good dads, good husbands, good community members, just as awesome as we think they are.
I absolutely love JJ bread. Team JJ on the bread front. Sandwiches or meh
Me watching this with my subway sandwich 😂
Everyone saying this should have been done blind is unrealistic. You're telling me when you make a sandwich you don't construct it in a certain way?
Glad to know link is still as childish as ever.
i love jersey mikes
This seems like an unfair comparison. Jersey Mikes vs. Firehouse or JJ vs. Subway would be closer imo.
Subway is better
Jeez.... I don't think that therapy is helping  Link. That guy is a few eggs shy of a dozen. 🥚🥚
Jersey Mike’s is THE BEST sandwich chain hands down. Only thing that comes close it Potbelly
HOW MIGHT YOU…. Lmao
JERSEY MIKE'S FTW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The italian nightclub did not look made correctly
James Jonathan's vs New Jersey Michael's
Jersey Mike is my dad
I met him in Michigan at a MU game he rocked
JJ is by far superior to JM. I can’t believe they missed it this bad.
they gotta try a Primo Hoagie.
I need that shirt, Rhett.
We all knew the fight was over before it started lol. Now do Cousin's vs. Jersey Mikes.
I just want take these two guys to a barber shop.
I know it's a gimmick, but Link using the knife still made me nervous...
I don’t know if y’all have already done this but it would have been a better matched if y’all did Jersey Mike’s vs Quiznos? Are there enough comparable menu items to compare?
Jersey Mike's no contest
"Just goose egg it"
Peter cancro became founder and ceo of Jersey mikes at 17 years old 🤯
jersey mike everyday
Why do you guys eat across each other   rather than pulling the sandwich in front of you so you each have he contestants in front of you. That way your not eating over your buddies food
17:40 fin.
: )
Dibella’s is better
This one isn't even close. Jersey Mikes is 10000x better than JJ. I think you guys should do Firehouse vs. JM or Quiznos or Penn Station
come to Philly for a HOAGIE
The correct answer is Penn Station lol
As someone from the north east (where hoagies are good) neither shop are any good lol
i miss blimpies
That's my favorite shirt that Rhett owns. Love when he wears it. 😅
I love Link's mini rant @ 14:24 haha
There's no way a 14 year old saved $125,000 in three years working as a sandwich maker so I think it's probably more accurate to say his parents bought Jersey Mikes
Jersey Mike’s is far superior to JJ
I love Subway over both of those.
I love you guys, but I can't trust your credibility knowing you've already had Jersey Mike's plenty of times before, sorry.
Former JM employee of 3 years, first of all classroom is BS idk where that came from BUT as an employee I have been on the Jersey Mikes train for YEARS hailing it as the undisputed heavyweight fast casual sandwich KING  GLAD TO SEE IT AFFIRMED
Link:  It's got noice bahcon on itt  Me:  I didn't know Jersey Mike's was Australian
Now compare to Togo's.
Now we have to get a Spork to to do a proper review to fix Link's rants.
No new hires don't have to have 8-10 weeks of training! I'm a GM and have been with the company for 8 years. However new hires DO go through several weeks of training with in store hands on training in store. We do have a strict training process as far as the specific ways things are done!! THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT REVIEWS!!
that's capicola both have it
Not one of their better ones
Here come the people crying about better help 🙄
I worked at jersey mikes. Never went to a classroom. Just on the job training
The Wes Anderson reference was on point. haha
Damn this vid is old we haven’t had the kickin Cajun chicken in a few months
Have you ever been to The Grinder in Pasadena?
I work for Jersey Mikes. The classroom training is when you go to new jersey and learn from the og employees. Most of the time they send assistant managers and general managers. It’s not for every employee
Did he really start the business?  Or did his dad, by giving him $25,000?
Link is def turning into a Karen as time moves on. Just saying.
“Grown man has a temper tantrum”
Jersey mikes is one I need to try a bit more I guess, but Mr. Pickles is right here and their dutch crunch is kind of amazing for bread
I'd love to see a Jersey Mikes vs. Subway episode just to see Subway get absolutely decimated 😂
I’m so jelly of whoever got all those jersey mikes points 😅
I’ve had both of them, Jersey Mike bread is just not good,  I don’t need to watch the rest of the video, if you think Mike’s bread is not gross, I don’t listen to you.
Firehouse better than both.
Jonny Jim’s is so bad, Mike jersey all the way🙏🏼
Knew this destruction was coming. Jersey Mikes is the best.
But Jersey Mikes is really good cold sandwiches I like my sandwiches grilled or warm and Jersey mikes don’t do that well at least the one where I live don’t.
I’m a Mr. Pickles kind of guy lol.
I love Jersey Mike’s but I feel like a fairer match up would be firehouse vs mikes
Jersey Mike's: FINALLY, my worthy opponent, are battle will be LEGENDARY!! 💪
It’s not an actual classroom they are online training videos lol
reminds me of the 2016 election.  just brutal.  :)
I don’t understand the point of these when they already know what they like more
Mikes is lightyears better than
Let's be honest here. Everyone knew this wouldn't even be a competition...everyone except Jenna apparently.
Where did Rhett find that shirt? Someone pls help
better help in 2024 xD
I really miss the various waiter characters
Didn’t they already do this?
i used to work at a quiznos and i hated it
Mike’s way and CPR is the way to go. Jersey Mikes changed my life from eating Subway ngl
JJ is so good, ofc what anyone says about the bread. bread is supposed to have a crust. I could eat JJ bread on its own
Sigh. Ditch Better Help. Y’all are better than this…
I'm from Colorado, where Snarfs Sandwiches reigns supreme!
This is a rhetorical episode tf 😅
I’m sorry, but you walk in with a preconceived notion about which one you like and then attempt to give it a fair assessment, not possible
Link is such a dramatic binch 😭 “how am I supposed to eat this?!”
Ike's Sandwiches are better than both of these places!
My favorite one! I rate it a ZERO lmao
I love me a solid Link rant 😂 especially when I agree. also, I enjoy Food Feuds not being blind taste tests bc presentation matters when comparing the brands. we get tons of blind taste tests in other vids. just my opinion🤷🏼‍♀️
Danny Divito was RIGHT
I like JJ bread but Mies is prob better
I like both places, but honestly I have been going for Jersey Mike’s lately because of their rosemary parmesan bread. Nothing beats that bread
These owners of the companies are bad people look it up
Jersey Mike’s Italian = ham sandwich
I always get firehouse they took my fav slaw away so I went to JJ when I tell you I was so mad I spent $12 on a sandwich that was cold and had no flavor!
link's anger at 14:10 is exactly how I feel every time I eat JJ. Great sandwich, but makes no sense how they assemble it.
I think both of them are showing why this episode should've been a blind taste test.
Cant believe i missed the tour presentation.... :😢 hopefully they redo that❤
Not even close! Jersey mikes is the best!
Jersey Mike's ftw
Does anyone know where Rhett’s shirt is from???
If you think Jersey Mike's Italian sandwich is a 9/10 and you can't imagine anything better, Rhett, it is time for a field trip to New York.
I like both
I’ve never understood the appeal of JJ
If Jersey Mike's had capicola on it's Italian, it would be way better
Good Mythical Morning, This made me laugh so hard, thanks for sharing!
Link's meltdown in the last round is class.
Only people that haven’t had Jersey Mikes wouldn’t agree with this
why is everyone so mad
big kahuna SLAYS
still strongly think shouldnt tell them who is who in this game so its truly hidden.
I was on the fence about what to get for dinner tomorrow night after work. I get Jersey Mike's every now and then. But this solidified my decision and I'm going to get a Big Kahuna chicken cheesesteak. Never tried it before but this made up my mind for me. Thanks Rhett and Link.
I love how passionate link has been this whole episode 😭
They both make subpar Sandwiches
Firehouse and jersey mikes would have been a way better comparison
Jersey Mikes wins over all of the others.
I didn't know that Link is an actual Karen lol
Charles...you gotta take 2 bites. Left and right to get all insides, very sinple
4.6k dislikes wow
Jersey Mike’s is the Goku of the sandwich world  You can’t put them in a poll they always win
jersey mikes is perfect and unbeatable
Jersey Mike's is far superior!
Hogie team assemble 👇
I was born in 1965, and I’m Michael 😂😎
Jersey Mike’s, ALWAYS ! 😎👍
JM cherry pepper relish !!!!
I just realized that you guys remind me of watching Wayne's World sketches
Back home we only had subway, where I live now, only subway.
Back home we only had subway, where I live now, only subway.
Mikes is anti LGBTQ and I thought you were supportive of the community.
Better Help spons gots to go
Thanks for promoting mental health support, but even with the promo you guys gave, I still can't afford better help.
I’ve never eaten at Jersey mikes but I can confidently say they will win every round
I prefer Firehouse myself but Jersey Mike's has always been a good backup for me. Makes sense to me that it won.
I'm upset there is no jersey mikes in my area
"How might you not make a taco?"🤣
Conspiracy theory: Rhett and Link are not friends anymore. They're still together for the kids (us)
something about JJ bread is just so chewy
You're a damn crybaby Link😢
Jersey Mikes is so much better it’s insane. The guys nailed this one.
Hello from Tennessee love the content and the videos always keep me laughing more gross food episodes .. ps I want a coffee mug lol
Idea:  Make a naked foods but you have to guess which one was made by the mythical kitchen
I know everybody loves jersey mikes but I’ll always be a subway girlie
Please redo the Foodinary (Pictionary with food) episode! It’s incredibly funny and I’m sure you guys would be great at it after all this time!  It is my all time favorite episode!
4:05 Italians eat tomatoes you dork, grow up
Jersey mikes is the obvious choice.
I work at jersey mikes and we indeed do frown down upon our opponents 😂
I get the #8 also
Stop advertising fake therapy.
Why even make videos like this we all know you well enough to know who the victor was going to be
Do it blind now! Dare you!
Jeez these guys need to retire already
Team subway here
Link.  My dude.   You try to stand on principle, but it makes your ratings meaningless.  A 10 or a 0 means absolutely nothing from you
Prosciutto or capicola but jersey mikes has both lol
How is this even a question jersey mikes allday everyday
Have yall never eaten a hoagie before? You are eating the sandwich sideways.  I swear link is legit one of the least intelligent and non funny person on here.  Dude just acts like a female and thinks like 1 too
There’s no competition, Jersey is 1000x better
The Big Kahuna! #42.  The answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and what's for lunch?
No more better help
Love the man bun,  NOT!
I've never had either, but I can confidently say I make a better sandwich.
do it blind next time please make a poll
I just seen your song dope zebra on my magic piano smule I had to get it
I wonder if they actually know how shady and actually bad Better Help actually is.
It’s the gabagool
“It makes me feel safe.”😂
Jersey Mike's all the way!!!
Jersey Mikes is the best!
I liked it more than any of the others. While scoring it the least is why you can't trust the outcome. Also I've never eaten at either place so I have no say which is better.
Aight but they're praising Mike's this much, imagine what would happen if it was Mike's Vs. Firehouse
Jersey Mikes hands down
Rhett says it would be better if they weren’t tasting it right after Mikes, maybe try johns first then?
As a former jersey mikes employee no there was no classroom training
i actually support doing these tests blindfolded!! at least once!!!
It's hard to stay up to date 💫
team turkey tom 👇
Why didn't they do this against firehouse since jj already lost to them?
Yeah, but does Jersey Mike's deliver? That's a big part of why I go with Jimmy's.
Better help is a big yikes do your research!
i like the lopsided sandwiches
Firehouse >>>
Jersey mikes always
Last was in-fact, least.
Agreed jersey Mike's is the best!!
Do penn station vs firehouse .. substation ll may be the best of all time tho
Jersey mikes is for cheese steaks not cold cuts smh
JJ ALL THE WAY
I love the painters vs turtles rap battle
No question jersey mikes is better
I would like an official average per episode of how many “you know what I’m saying” there are
Those chicken sandwiches are so good that I’ve made them 3 more times since filming that wheel of mythicality video
Potbelly is better than either of the choices.
The chicken Cesar sandwich from JJ is bomb but that’s about it
Where is Rhett's shirt available?
will it popcorn
Love them both , but my favorite is the tuna melt I make at subway.
this is the second time GMM has chosen Jersey Mike's as an all time winner. maybe even third because they've won both free birthday things
I gotta make things right, make it the way it's supposed to be, that's my OCD ...
Firehouse VS Jersey Mikes
Every time I’ve gone to Jersey mikes it’s been bland af. I don’t understand the hype
Jersey Mike's is gross
Seriously you guys gotta stop the Better Help partnership.
This is the biggest hit piece I’ve seen on here. I’m not with it, JJ is the spot
The hinge and toppings in the hinge make it easier to eat and not as messy.
Always sad with no tomatoes.
Who knew Link would be so passionate about sandwiches
You guys should try Earl of Sandwich.
Looking at Link with tattoos is like looking at a toddler/granny with tattoos.
JJ enjoyers also breath through their mouths
If the bread didn't have a hinge it would just be a sandwich 😉
These are my fav videos thank you
I worked at Jersey Mike’s and no, I didn’t have to take a class. I was trained for about a week. I did have to memorize everything on the menu in a couple days for a raise tho (which I did)
Should of tried the beach club at JJ
Seeing how those JJ sandwiches were made with bad proportions doesn’t represent them well. Wish they were made better bc JJ is fire
This is what happens when Link doesn't get a scoring chart
Sees title of video…clicks and sits back preparing for the bloodbath. 😂
Wheres the Cheese steak??? I drive 15miles to eat one every weekend...amazing you didnt do one
This was such a blowout JJ might sue for slander
Link getting mad at jj’s was the best part about this episode
I knew this was gonna be a slaughter
Jersey mikes is just better lol
Team JMikes. They have better bread options and more toppings.
jmmie johns and mikes are a choice for me. Lets just say I probably wont be walking into a jimmies johns any time soon.
capriotti’s sandwich shop is the best sandwich place
As someone who has lived where both Jimmy's and Mike's reign Supreme, it only took the first visit to Mike's to switch over. Lol
Didn’t they already do this?
Make it a 10 by adding the red pepper stuff at jersey 's
Where do I get that shirt Rhett? Love it
Capriottis needs to enter the competition 😊
so clearly toasted the bread makes a difference
This just turned into a complete JJ bash 😂
I think there’s such a big difference between these two places that even doing a blind taste test, they would know it immediately
This was never a contest lol
I dont know if its GMM or YT but the commercials are aggressive today. Every minute and half.
Why are you guys still pushing Better Help?
When do you guys try to all PRIME flavours?
Better help sells all your data to third parties sadly
Been waiting for a food feud for ages. Love that its back again with the tournament.
I don’t live where there’s jersey mikes but if you guys send me one I’ll love you forever 😊
“It was my favorite thing from them today! - Link “You gave it a zero” -Rhett 😂😂😂
Link needs to be banned from ever ranking food again
i do really wish they would stop taking sponsors from better help, the episode is really good though
Wait til you get a hoagie in Philly. Get your cheesesteak but not at the tourist spots. And get a hoagie so you can see what a real sandwich is all about.
I don't think I've ever seen them give a score of 0 before 🤣
Not another better help sponsor 😭😭😭
STOP WORKING WITH BETTER HELP JFC
These jj suba are looking sad mine never look like that. Maybe its a west coast issue?
Subway is way better than both
The pickles are the difference! Jersey Mike's pickles are the best and you can't even get proper pickles at JJ's!
WHERE did rhett get his shirt in this video??? it looks so cool! i gotta find one for my boyfriend 😊
Stop complaining about the lettuce being in the side. Some of us like it that way
I never had Jersey Mikws, my order for JJ everytime is the gargantuan.
Was this a april fools episode
Honestly need to be blinded for this kinda takes away the fun and it’s such a simple way to eat blind
I’m going to guess that the ocular problem brought on by stress was central serous chorioretinopathy.
Rhett saying he can feel the writing on the paper was under appreciated
Listening to Link fake complain about a sandwich is not what I want to do this early in the morning.
Jersey Mikes is king of sandwiches!!
Link whining just to whine.
I miss the workers that bring them in :(
Haven't you already done this one?
How are y’all still supporting better help? There are so many videos proving their shady practices and problematic service y’all should know better by now
You two are idiots.
Team jersey here but also feel better that the only JJ sandwich I get is the Italian so it lines up
I wish other institutions in my life could nail it like Jersey Mikes does
Firehouse > Both
There's a flaw in Rhett's argument. Just take away the paper and you can't tell which is which.
I used to used to work at a JJ's years ago. The sandwiches made now just seem skimpy...the only good thing kept up is the bread. If I only go to JJ nowadays, I only get a loaf and a few sides of ranch
Best way to eat JJs is with the wrapper on and ripping it as you eat
Neither of them got nothin' on Cheba Hut
Do Jersey Mike's vs. Pen Station
Calm down lol
The big thing about JJ not being considered is that they are fast and efficient.  If i am pressed for time I will go there.  They are that fast (same with delivery)
Y’all should of done primos hogies too
I thought they were the same thing
I've never heard of either of these places and I live in a big city.
Penn Station crushes them both.
I know a place with an AMAZING Italian and jersey mikes is not the place with the best 😭
You may need to look into better help as a sponsor. It’s not a very good look.
you have to do pin station
Potbellys is better
You guys should do oreo gut check with all the cookies
ik theyre comedians but link is actually making me mad this episode lol
I wasn’t the one who said it but I DO think there should be a blind taste test for these types of episodes.
Links logic is so insane
The gargantuan is actually my favorite sandwich it's also never came with Lettuce like that
Jerry Mike's Original Italian "Mike's Way" is one of the best fast food sandwiches you can get, IMO. I'd even rate it just a little bit higher than a Popeyes Spicy Chicken Sandwich.
Should have been blind.  Missed an opportunity here.
The lack of servers in this episode was a serious vacuum...
I work at jersey mikes I was not trained like that lmao
Haven't tried either one. Neither one has locations in my area.
I feel bad for people that think jersey mikes is good.
Nothing hits better than a JJ BLT that’s been sitting in the sun all day while you’ve been swimming in the lake. Pop a fresh cold brew and enjoy JJ perfection.
Shoulda just announced the winner before even eating
Of course Jersey Mike's won 💀
BTW blind taste test between JM and Subway needs to happen soon lol.
Greetings from sweden   Love the show since many years   Would be cool with a episode there ya guys dive into swedish folklore   There is very much crazy stuff there 😂
This needed to be blind. If you are going to score based on how it looks and be impartial already to Jersey Mikes by having your favorite already, is it really a fair comparison? The last sandwhich Link rated is based on look alone. 🙄
Jersey Mike's is better
No contest. Useless episode...jersey all the way
Jimmy’s for life 🥪 ❤
STOP. ADVERTISING. BETTER. HELP.
they should have done this blindfolded!
i saw this landslide a mile away, you get what you pay for
They let Link use a knife, and said nothing. He then proceeded to use the knife like a normal human being and then put it away when he was done with no incident. What show am I watching?!
How insufferable. Just glad jordan wasn't here.
Definitely knew they were Team Jersey Mike’s. Also blind taste test are better but oh well.
If you want something not on jersey mikes menu grab yourself a #99
Cool sauce 👍
If I didn't know how good Jersey Mike's is... I'd think they're a sponsor of the show 😂
I was Doordashing today and delivered next to a chick fil a traning building.  I had never seen it before. And ill i could think of was some person presenting a power point on the ins and outs of chick fil a.
Uh I thought link wasn't allowed to play with knives
seems like they came into this already knowing they like Jersey Mikes better
Where does Banh mi rate in this scale? Did it not rank because there's no franchise chains around?
Link is spot on...lol
What about subway
Give us Jersey Mike's vs Firehouse!!!
JJ is to little for too much
No cheesesteaks?
You guys always do a blind taste test on things like this and that is how you should have done it on this one!!!! You Like Jersey Mike's so you already knew who was going to win not fair!!!!!
as a former employee of jersey mike's the training is not in the classroom lol
Jersey mikes anyyyy day of the week
Link is such a diva about everything. He needs to grow up and act his age and not have a stomach and all like a 2 year old.
I respect the anger over the poorly crafted sandwich.  Toppings should be included in EVERY BITE.
working at jersey mikes, i just knew jersey mikes would be overall better
Finally one the Midwest can understand 🎉 I’m curious to know the wage difference. Where the passion in sandwich is…
* everything Link said about lopsided toppings, but for taco bell burritos *
If I made those JJ sandwiches they would have gotten a 100
Jersey Mike’s vs Potbelly’s would be a great challenge
please reach better help before using them again as a sponsor, thank you
I don't like either place lol  I'm here to say Rhett's shirt is giving me Back to the Future part 2 vibes. It reminds me of the hat Marty wears when they go into the future.
i feel like it should have been firehouse vs jersey mikes
Team penn station here
Should've been Jersey Mikes versus Penn Station. Seems like a more even match lol
Please release more songs like “Belly Button” my kids love your songs.
I haven’t watched gmm in a year and link almost has a sleeve 🤣🤣
Wish we voted on taste and not on presentation. That's where the blind taste would be more accurate.
I get having a clear preference, and stating it. But Link going on and on, whining and bitching about the toppings not being placed perfectly really got on my nerves this time for some reason. A big part of me wanted to just say, shut up and either eat it or not. But do shut up. Lol, doesn't usually bother me.
Never been to either but now if I have too I know which one to go to lol
Team Better Help sells your data and mental health information to the highest bidder and has been proven to do so  👎
Josh needs to bring you guys a wawa italian hoagie
Link is absolutely correct about the asymmetry. It does not make any sense.
I literally had Jersey Mikes today as it was catered to my work 😂
Can’t beat Jersey Mike Philly cheese steak it’s actually comparable to up north
You guys really gotta stop using Better Help as a sponsor...they are not good..
Team never heard of either here
I share Link's rage for lopsided sandwiches. Unacceptable! 😂
Why are you supporting better help?
Am I the only that remembers when anything spicey would cause them to hiccup?
So, I am a mytgical beast from outside the US and today all the GMM videos are in Portuguese, including the ones I have already watched in English. Is anybody experiencing that? How do I fix it? The other English -spoken videos from the other channels I am subscribed to are still in English.
Stop freaking promoting Better Help
team canadian so i don’t have these 👇🏻
I worked for Mike's starting in 2021, there was no classroom, but a whoooole lot of training videos. I loved working there and will always love their sammies!!!
Should've done Jersey mikes against Firehouse
Have they ever done Jerseys Mike vs Subway?
Jersey Mikes for life!!! Been waiting for this episode!!!!
why win a sponsorship  yall aint all that  rather spend millions on commercials than sponsor you lmao
Jersey Mike's every time, hands down.
Link = no clue
“How might you..” is gonna be my new method of dealing with stressful people 😂
Firehouse !!!
They just made this episode to 💩 on JJ. Smh
uh i was a manager at jersey mikes and most of the stuff they said just wasn't true there is no class new people unless your management usually general manager
I usually enjoy GMM episodes. They are normally a great way for my  partner and I to wind down at the end of the day.  I have never once thought an episode was bad... however this was not good. I felt like I was getting yelled at through the screen.
Jersey Mike's is objectively better. 😊
No contest Jersey Mike's all the way
I don't know if I'm the only one who does this but I end watching the Friday episodes on Saturday morning cause I live in Australia
Link--just breathe-its only a sandwich--lol
I find Jersey Mike’s very bland whenever I eat it. I don’t put the Oregano on anymore because that just made the whole thing taste like Oregano. So it’s between bland and tasteless vs. oregano.
Links two minute rant about topping placement 🤣
I like both!!!!! GARGANTUAN!!!! Philly cheesesteak from jersey are pretty dang good!!!!!
You guys should try Deli Delicious!
I FN LOVE JERSEY MIKE'S
What a BJ session…
I’m pretty sure that training is for franchisees or whoever runs the store.  Definitely not the kid putting together the sandwich for minimum wage.  😊
Love these fueds! Please put the prices on the screen. I love seeing the difference and I always miss Stevie say it.
I like them both. I’m happy with either.
firehouse on top
Episode idea! I went to Kroger in Cincinnati,Oh and was inspired. Gut check, Jones Soda! They just did a special release for the summer, Hatch Chili & Lime flavor. Its wild lol
Jersey mikes for the win
please revoke links engineering degree, he has no understanding of how math works
Jersey mikes is such a good sandwich place. We actually eat there every friday. They are a bit pricey but taste great. I had subway the other day and it made me remember how good jersey mikes is 😂
😆😆😆😆😆😆😆 It would have been closer with Jersey Mikes and Firehouse
I feel like if any company was going to actually take them up on the ep sponsorship offer, it would be Jersey Mike’s 😂
jersey mikes is top tier only other sandwich chain that rivals them for me is cheba hut
Who else wants to see erberts and gerberts vs potbelly sandwiches?
You both made it clear that you prefer Jersey mikes from the beginning so YES this should have been a Blindfolded tasting!
I am 100% with Link. Subway does the same thing. QUIT MAKING LOPSIDED SANDWICHES!
That's crazy lol. Me and my girlfriend used to go to Jersey Mikes all the time, then one day we decided to go to JJ and we liked it. Then we went back to Jersey Mikes and hated it because it did not taste as good as JJ's lol so now we're JJ fans lol
Honestly...at this point I'm so done with Rhett and him being a hypocrite and having a Me ME ME attitude 😒
As I sit down with my jersey mikes, the superior sandwich. I am eager to see who wins this episode.
I went and got Jersey mikes for the first time after watching this
You know if Link gives something a 10, it has to be one of the best things you can taste.
Rhett I have a close friend that works at a museum and let me tell you what you just said its pure bologna. They have an executive chef that personally procure the food for the exhibition menu. Go to the Cincinnati Museum sometime.
Better Help huh... cool, gotta boycott an episode I was interested in. Sad
Togo’s is the best . Too bad everting is getting overpriced these days
Jersey Mikes is the BEST fast food sandwich maker in the US and it will never be close.
2:00 A perfect moment to say “who’s grinder is a little grander”
Too bad about the better help sponsorship. I hope you can break the contract with them.
Subway > Mike > John
Wow, link was being extra bitchy in this episode. What a whiney turd.
I am starting to think that Rhett was assigned to Link as a part of a special needs outreach program and Rhett being the angel he is fully committed for life.
Winner vs subway?
Really guys? Better Help? Come on now..
Link is so passionate 🤣🤣🤣
That's not a club sandwich.
For reference, $125,000 in 1975 (when the 17 year old bought Jersey Mike's) has the same buying power as over $750,000 today.
How about gut check cheese edition
They really gas up jersey mikes that much when it’s only a little better than subway. Sorry Jersey Mike lovers. Its not this good lol
Glad they did this comparison.  When they did Subway vs Jersey Mike's, I thought it was like comparing hamburger vs filet mignon.
Link, you take your food apart and reassemble it all the time! Why can't you do that here? It's honestly like dealing with a toddler.
why is link holdin a knife?!! O.O
Links logic just never makes sense @ all and I find him just copying rhett 85% of the time 😂
This made me order an italian from Jersey Mike's
im convinced everyone complaining about the better help sponserships doesnt actually care plz shut up and stop virtue signaling THEY ARE UNDER CONTRACT
I'm seriously getting tired of them sponsoring the evil company known as Better help
JERSEY MIKES OF COURSE!!!
Link having a conniption about the lopsided toppings and hinge gives me energy entering into this weekend.
you know you watch gmm to much when you can predict their scores based on on what they say
Penn station better than both by far🎯
Do Jersey Mikes Vs Primos Hoagies!!!!!!
I dont know how good of a idea this is but i would love to see “Does brand cologne smell better than non brand cologne”
i love kimmy jons italian with jalepeno peps and extra mayo and vinagrette fire asf
Jersey Mike’s team
Firehouse beats both. 🤓🤠
I been to Jersey Mike's. Was a real treat. Pricey though. But worth it for an occasional treat
I would like to see where everyone at mythical has a personalized order and they try that.
And we in museums love you too, Rhett!
I was told JJ is alot like Subway and it looks that way
I’m on team subway😂
I wanna see Jersey Mike’s vs Publix. This was an unfair battle from the get go
Link, Sir you just take two smaller bites side by side, not one giant bite in the middle.
Yeah, they should definitely do it blindfolded
JJs all day every day. Love the bread. More like a baguette
Please do an allergy alternative taste test. Like for peanut allergies there’s almond butter, sunflower butter etc and see what is the best alternative
My dad was a Michael born in 1960 😂
This episode was over before it began. Wish we had a Jersey Mikes in my town.
Rhett did a really great job helping link back away from the ledge there 😅
Yeah I'm going to say no such thing on actually classrom training for all of the Jersey Mike's employees; GMs and AMs maybe but no training happens other than on the when they start working at a Jersey Mike's 😂
For me it comes down to simple availability. There's a JJ right around the corner, never even seen a jersey mikes in my life.
just wanted to stop by and say you guys are amazing!
I don't know if I've ever been as passionate about anything as Link is about topping distribution
Why do Americans need to say tuna “fish”? Is there another kind of tuna? They wouldn’t say “chicken bird”
I worked at Jersey Mikes for a bit. Absolutely still love their sandwiches. Will always order them whenever they pop in my head
I like how link is mad about his "toppings" being on one side, when it's just lettuce basically lol
This video didn’t really seem impartial I feel like they knew what they were picking beforehand
Yeah they need to be blind
If you didn't know which was going to win by reading the title, you must be new here. Yawn.
Old man, Link! LOL
Therapy is so great. Better Help is not. Please please rethink your sponsorship.
Publix vs Boar’s head
Big kahuna chicken or steak is top shelf.
I respectfully disagree with everything Link has said.  No... disrespectfully.
Best Sandwich Shop in North Carolina— Ideal’s Deli! Their Italian is even better than Jersey Mikes 👀 Handmade bread, quality ingredients
I see they changed the thumbnail to make it look a little more fair
No surprise on that turnout
you forgot where you came from upgrade the damn kitchen its not funny anymore
i was like wow a 19 year old started a business that’s crazy,,,,”his dad gave him 25,000$”.   oh.. that’s why
STOP USING BETTER HELP SPONSORSHIPS
honestly, i don't mind a lopsided sandwich ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
LA must really be struggling with hoagies if Rhett can't imagine a much better Italian
Cousin's 🥪
Jersey Mike's > JJ
love these type of videos because I live in New Zealand and have never tried any of these foods
Please stop with the better help 😭
There are many better comparisons to jerseys then Jimmy's lol
Now I have to go get Jersey Mike's 😂
Oh cool, i get to listen to Link complain about food for 20 minutes
They didn’t even do Mike’s Famous Philly!  That’s a great sandwich.
I recently got my gf (who is a picky eater) to start eating sammys and it was jersey mikes. She has been obsessed since!
Please do an Epic rap battle about yourselves: Rhett VS Link 😄🤷‍♂️
Youl think jersey mikes is good until you have primos.
wow what a coincidence kinda? i was craving a sandwich for lunch today and seriously contemplated goin to JJ. went to portillo instead for a dipped italian beef
D’Angelos vs jerseys mikes from new england
Loved it Link
jersey mikes<333
Where is Links rating cheat board?
Link is a certified D1 hater😭😭
Haven't watched the episode yet but in my personel experience Jersey Mike's clears JJ's by a mile. The ONLY thing good about JJ's is the bread. The rest is super mid.
Commenting before I watch... If Jersey Mikes doesn't queen sweep this thing I lost all faith.
I do think they should be blind taste tests
Man I just love JJ’s bread/Mayo combo
Subway is the best.
I had that chicken cheese for lunch from Mike's. Good eating right there.🤤
8 to 10 weeks in a classroom?? Whos making this BS up?
Subway way better and Firehouse
Link, you whine like a b***
Team Ike's
Everyone knew it was Jersey mikes before the taste test even started.. giving things a 0 then saying they taste the best defeats the purpose of a taste test. They need to do these blindfolded for actual ratings because link also judges on everything but taste and no the way sandwich looks does not change the taste.
Should have done Jersey Mikes vs Firehouse
I’m watching this while on my lunch break… from working at Jersey mikes…
Better Help, again... Those roaches are back?
They may be sponsoring but it's probably in bad taste to continue promoting better help. They care more about their image then actually helping people
These West boys have never had a WaWa
Rhett giving Jersey Mikes ItalIan a 9 immediately told me I wasnt going to agree with anything
Just started the video and the answer is objectively jersey Mike's.
JJ’s is 🚮🗑️🚮🗑️
Jersey Mike’s is superior.
They like Italian sandwiches but don’t know what capicola is?
The Wes Anderson joke was sublime.
I’ve never had Jersey Mike’s…today that changes
personally i am okay with both places. But Jersey Mikes is still my favorite is still a solid go to for me
You’re telling me you gave JJ an advantage by not eating Jersey Mikes Philly Cheesesteak, and JJ still lost? No contest.
Hey guys! I love that you’re promoting therapy and it’s a wonderful message. But you should stop promoting better help as it isn’t a great company. I would recommend looking into the company a bit more.
“You know what I’m sayin” -Rhett  Count 3
Woo woo! Quiznos fan club rise up
Thank you, I been saying it for years, JJs is not good. Mmmm, cold, stale sandwiches! Honestly Subway is better, and that is a rough thing to say. Jersey Mikes and Firehouse all the way!  Don't believe me? Try sticking two fingers in your ass.
Possibly biggest blowout in Food Feud history??
Can we not promote better help? They dont even give you licensed therapists its just random people.
They gotra be sick of doing nothing but food videos by now right?
Cheba Hut > Jersey Mikes. That would have been a better comparison
Potbelly better
They forgot about “sandwich hands” which is the smell the delicious sandwich leaves behind on your hands once you’re done. A crucial factor for me
I’m shocked the cancro special scored so low. It’s my favorite thing at Jersey Mike’s! A single layer of pepperoni enhances but does not overpower the roast beef. It’s brilliant.
I feel like we hit a sensitive spot for Link 😅
Man I’ve never disagreed with Rhett and Link this hard before, I love me some JJ’s
i'm Canadian we don't have 99% of what America has
Oh great, another better help episode. That's too bad, was really looking forward to watching this episode.
JJ all the way
I think it would've been cool if they included Subway and Firehouse and make this a four-way blind taste fued!
jersey Mikes forever
Day 400 of commenting until extreme axe throwing returns!!!
Team subway
I like my lil mom and pop subshop where I live, for some reason when you order a veggie you get a mini side of cashews
Neither really
Better help episode? Lemme look at comments see how quickly people are saying something. 9 spots.
I dont think that Jersey Mikes fact bout tuna is true… or at least wasnt a thing when i worked there a few years ago
They came in with a preference in their mind. Hated the whole time.
Dibella’s > J Mikes
Why are there 5000 comments about the sandwich school thing, anyone with a basic understanding can figure that they are not sending every teenager to sandwich college. Its a cool thing they offer to people serious about continuing their company
Me and link agree on sandwich hinges 😅
Team Mike! Their Original Itallian is my go to.
I love the shirt Rhett is wearing! Can I get any info on it?
I have never agreed with Link more
No
Listen yall really should do a series called like ‘do we really like it better?’ Where you take all the winners from food feuds and have them eat them blindfolded to see if they really do like it better
really hoping the better help partnership ends soon! the amount of people scammed and wronged by better helped is alarming. super bummed to see some of my favorite internetainers supporting that
Not going to lie, this is probably the least enjoyable food feud episode, imo
come to philly for BEST italian hoagies you can get
Terribly cens0red comm3nt section. You should be ashamed
I could feel links anger about the lopsided sandwich and I really don't blame him, I get it.
Why bother doing episodes where you know the outcome before you even start?
Has anybody noticed some tension between rhett and link lately? Its like watching your parents fight, i dont like ittt
17:38 “from Jef Shosh Mythical Cookbook”
I love Jersey Mike's Chipotle cheesesteak it's Bank
@14:10 Has lInk EVER been this passionate about anything?????????
2:01 starts here 👍
Should be blind
IMO jersey mikes is way better. had both of them plenty of times.
Anybody gonna tell them about better help?
Firehouse is better than both
Definitely should have been a blind test.
We don't have either of these in Canada where I live, yet here I am.
Love me some Jersey Mike's, but ngl I feel seen with them panning the Roast Beef. It's legit the only not good thing on the menu.
Was the point of this episode just to dunk on JJ? Maybe it just isn't great in LA? But I feel like they were overreacting on both ends.
Idky I used to think these places was the same thing
W gmm
The amount of Better Help advertising/sponsoring sure is suspect
Potbelly’s next
Ah yes, New Jersey Michael’s and James Jonathan’s
The annoyance i have in this comparison, is embarrassing.
The classroom training for JJs is just for the managers
Watching Link slowly transform into his dad is a real treat to watch. YAES.
Now just do Mikes vs Firehouse
hey fellow commenters— please do your research into your therapists and dont use better help!! many lawsuits and bad experiences with them
Do an episode of blind taste tests, vs not blind. Same foods, a week apart to see how the scores change.
Really should sponsor these guys... I'm ordered lunch from the winners today!
jmikes manager here, no the classroom thing isn’t true lol
Firehouse is what ya need
Jersy MIkes is my jam
The Totally Tuna is supposed to also have tomatoes
Jersey Mike's #9 club Supreme with their Chile pepper relish yum
Team Don't Have Any of Those Where I Live! ✊🏽
Do them "blind" !
these guys just order lunch and turn it into a video
Since when did Better Help become the new Temu…?
Better help is a known scammer
Southern people know Publix is where it’s at
Team Jersey Mike's. Good episode 🇨🇦🌞☀️💯🌴
wait when did they make a "be your mythical best" as a t-shirt???
either like the hinge or dont
Jersey Mike's win
Team firehouse here
Neither of these anywhere neat me.  So many of comparisons done here aren't relevant to us on the East Coast.
"Let's compare this thing we both love with this thing we don't care about and see which we prefer!". Very suspenseful...
How many interns have to read comments about how bad better help is before Mythical stops advertising them?
Link needs to stop screaming
You cant give something a 0, a 0 is no sandwich
Jersey Mike's has been a favorite of my husband and I for a few years now.
Should do jersey mikes vs cheba hut
I think Ike’s love and sandwiches would be a contender for being better than jersey mikes but they’re both so good I can’t even tell which is better
I don't think I've ever seen 2 people glaze jersey Mikes more than this episode
Haven’t they done this exact episode before?
Links frustration at the lopsided sandwich is exactly how I feel every time I get one. It’s tasty and then you get that last bite of just bread and it’s like meh
I’ve just discovered Euc (electric unicycle) can we get some Euc gmm content please
Link is so mad!
I always just choose subway
I love Jersey Mike's and it's the best thing ever but let's compare these chains in an unbiased way. It's like the peanut butter!
JJ all the way
lol @ classroom training. I had one of my younger customers walk in and I asked him how his first day was and he was like "dude... i made like 20 sandwhiches... i had no idea what I was doing"
the cheese is enthralled
Leave it to Link to find something else, other than taste, to judge during a TASTE TEST! lmao, Classic Link.
can one have gmm brain rot
Have you guys done Taco Bell VS Del taco? I think doing Trader Joe's VS Aldi would be cool to see too!
Ive never had either so my vote goes with whoever has the better logo and social media game
link was being too much of a hater
Agree with Rhett the big kahuna chicken cheesesteak is my fave. Sooooo good
Therapy is great! But you guys should look into the companies you promote, Better Help is a Zionist and problematic company, please discontinue partnership with this company
Jersey Mikes all the way!
The reflection on the phone behind Rhett always looks like a Wu-Tang symbol
Geez, just rename the show Jersey Mike's already!
im glad rhett and link take this debate as seriously as me and my friends do
JERSEY MIKES FOREVERRRR!! 🥪🥪🥪
I didn’t know i was watching a rhetts rant: link edition 😂
BOYCOTT BOTH!!!! Boycott both!! What is this??
You all really need to stop shilling for better help. They are nothing, but harmful.
I knew the winner before the start i just needed validation 😅.
Sandwich "tacos" are a huge pet peeve of mine. I, like Link,  want a sandwich that each bite has EVERY ingredient.
Giving a zero to a sandwhich based on being Lopsided…. Nothing to do with taste yeah that’s enough for tofay
Currently eating a Jersey Mike’s hoagie in Ewing, NJ 😎
Least favorite one I have ever watched sadly…
Blowing praise up your skirt... Wow, Link. Love those misogynistic comments. Keep them coming.
I worked at Jersey Mike’s in Sarasota Florida for about a year. My training was all in house for a few days. It is a very well ran company who does train their employees well. Very detailed and streamlined so every sandwich will be the same no matter what city you buy it in. Running that grill during the lunch rush takes a lot of patience and skill. They pay a decent hourly wage and the tips are good. So averaged $20 to $25 an hour. Not bad for making sandwiches and it was actually fun. 😊
The way link gives a 10 to a club sandwich that's not even a club cause he won't eat tomatoes
Jersey Mikes for the win!!!!
Most overrated (johns) vs most underrated (Mike's)
Nothing at Jersey Mike’s can compare to the big game hunters double roast beef at JJs
This should have been jersey mikes vs primo hoagies
There is a better way to get better help than Better Help. Pun intended!
Jersey mikes certainly looks good. Sadly, i dont have one near me. D:
Never been to either one! 😮😢
Jersey Mike's all the way
No comparison for me. Jersey Mike’s has my business hands down.
So… did Link not like that last sandwich or was I miss reading the vibes
I'm a former JJ's employee. The gargantuan was a mistake.
Hope these pre-episode sponsors wont become a daily thing. I thought I was listening to earbiscuits. xD
I think link is wearing Elton John’s glasses
Danny Devito vs Brad Garrett
Watch Documentary" The Better Help Youtube Virus is Back" if you want to learn more on why not to support this shady ass company.
You guys should do a Fast Food tournament with your favorite items from each store. Does the chicken bacon ranch from JM score higher than the Popeyes spicy chicken?
I tried jersey Mike's a few months ago and it's pretty good! Harder to find variety as a vegetarian though. Now I go to Which Wich 🤤🤤🤤
So was Emily on vacation?
Better help is evil. Don't support that company
I honestly feel sorry for whoever has to take care of Link when he's an old man
I love how link used a knife safely and correctly and it went completely unnoticed.
This felt like them glazing Jersey Mikes the whole episode. 😂
Great point, why don’t they do these type of videos blind…
JJ's never stood a chance.
18 minutes of Link complaining
why am I always surprised that Link has tattoos? am I the only one?
You gotta try a Firehouse Italian. Absolute game changer.
Link if anything is consistent with how inconsistent his ratings are
I completely agree with Link and his disdain for how that last sandwich was made
Subway crushes them both
i like subway better than both of these. sue me
I worked at jersey mikes for 3 months and had 0 classroom training lol
Haven't watched yet....but it ain't even close. Jersey Mike's all the way!
It’s not even close. Jersey mikes is so much better
Cool to see Jersey Mike's finally took the opportunity to sponsor this GMM episode!😂
Better Help is a scummy business. Thumbs down.
If I had had 25k back in the day and had a choice between dying or living I'd choose living too y'know
those who have never been to either wya 🙋🏽‍♂️
Something being called, “totally tuna” would definitely have me questioning if it’s tuna or not
Link baffled by the notion of taking more than one bite lol
Rhetts               man bun is so last year
Better Help STILL? Come on!
Knew the outcome before even clicking on the video. This is no  question.
"We've been blowing praise up your skirt all day." - Link Neal, 2024
Could have done a Triple Threat with Subway.
2 more chains that only exist in LA
2:23 tomatocide is something Link would be tried for at The Hague
I get the club lulu with dijon, extra lettuce, no tomato. good stuff
If Jersey Mike’s has Penn Station fries they would be elite
We need to see Jersey Mike’s versus Firehouse.
The amount of Gargantuan sandwiches I had in college is pretty shameful.
Never had jersey Mike’s. JJ’s is ok.
I honestly would never jj’s again. Mostly cuz of the bread and mostly cuz the stuff they put on it.
"The cheese is fully enthralled." - Link Neal, 2024
I AM SOOOOOO TIRED OF YOU GUYS PROMOTING BETTER HELP!!!!! IT DOESN'T WORK WHEN YOU CAN'T GET HELP!!!!!!
stop taking better help sponsorships
Let's not support the company, Better Help...
This was just a JJ slander episode because of the owner. Not a fair episode because their sandwich’s don’t look like that and link was being dramatic. Go to JJ
I know they are contractually obligated to promote Better Health but why is no one saying anything about it to them
wow not even close LOL
I agree the quality of jersey mikes is easily better, but for some reason i gravitate towards the bread of JJs. I like em both. If i liked jersey mikes bread more, itd probably be no competition
When you know a Mancinos Grinder blows them all away.....
I can't get used to Link having tattoos lol
I am going to let this decide my lunch today lol
Also Link's training would work so much better for me than the way Rhett said to "be productive" lol like I (personally) am just more motivated if someone tells me I'm screwing up 😂😂 but that's just me
This was the obvious outcome
Number 8 turkey club mikes way with chipotle mayo and pickles added is top tier 🤤
jersey mikes all mf day. getting some rn
Rhett's shirt looks beautifulllllll 😍😍😍😍
I LOVE IT when Link goes on a tangent 😂 I think they deserved it 👏
This was never going to be a contest.  Jersey Mikes is the best sandwich shop by a wide margin.
As someone who loveeeesss JJs I already know Mike’s is gonna be better lol
STOP SUPPPORTING BETTER HELP FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
Coincidentally I was debating between the two on what I should order for lunch. I guess I'll let my favorite internet dads make the decision for me
@sigy 😂
It’s as if one of them went to JJ and had a bad experience… instead of writing a yelp review they decided to destroy them for a 20 minute episode 😂
How did a 17 year old get $125,000????
Safe to say that JJs won't be sponsoring an episode anytime soon lol
This is just an unfair comparison
Well jersey mikes is wayyy better
Better Help is extremely bad please stop promoting them
Rhett the big kahuna is my favorite too!!! I was hoping you’d do this sandwich
I iust think jersey mikes is "juicier"
That Wes Anderson joke was elite 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Oh man, Link done lost it yall. That Gargantuan sent him over the top 😆 🤣.
Nooooo not better help, god dammit guys…
Total BS....
They were very unbiased in this video🤣🤣
im not a JJ huge fan but i cannot imagine choosing a soggy and oily sandwich by choice. so JJ wins this all day everyday for me.
You people mad about better help,  dont understand how contracts work
Jersey Mike's for sure. Firehouse cold Italian is a really close second for me.
A burrito is arranged the same way and no one no one dislikes a burrito
I’m totally with Link this whole episode!
Better help is canceling youtubers
This really shouldn’t even be close unless the jersey mikes got soggy on the way to the studio 😅
Felt like QVC for Jersey Mike’s 😅
Nice video alright 🙂
Rhett trying to calm Link after his rant and helping him give more constructive criticism is so wholesome
Rhett was carefully watching Link with that knife.😂
Link is right.
I'll go to war for jersey mikes
I just started working at Jersey Mike's, we actually have a REALLY solid and well standardized process for topping distribution. I won't say it's perfect every single time, but we do everything to make sure it's very consistent. As far as any other sandwich shop I've seen, we have the most thorough and comprehensive kitchen processes
Jersey mikes has always been better
"How might you NOT make a taco"?! 😂🤣
What happened to subway?
new joyzee
Ive said for years this needs to be done blindfolded
They were tuff on JJ. But Jersey mikes is definitely way better
capitalists deserve ZERO praise. they are merely reinforcing the status quo of human rights abuses and deprivation of basic human needs as means of coercion.
Needs to be blind test
If I saw Link at a restaurant I would imagine him opening up his raviolis eating the insides then eating the pasta outside. I believe that's how Link eats every time 😂
15:50 lettuce surprise was my nickname in highschool 😂
Jersey Mike’s all the way. Hope the boys agree
the bread looks better on jersey Mikes :)
Jersey Mike's all day!
A hoagies hinge must remain in tact. Love, a philly native
No competition, Mike's all the way
Please Link eat the sandwhich snd stop talking.
"How might you not make a taco??" 😂😂
I been to Jersey Mike's once but didn't like it. Don't have many options for their sandwiches.
im just confused why they're still working with better help with all their troubles and lawsuits 🤔
Link has strong sandwich ethics
B3tter h3lp doesn’t have real therapists
16:02. What’s up brother☝🏻 TUESDAY TUESDAY
hey friends.... i think youve seen the comments and issues with better help as they are a not great company.... you continuing to support them is really concerning and makes me thunk you dont care about these really valid concerns
We all need a sandwich that makes us feel safe 😂
Neither of these places look great.
Capicola
Jersey Mikes tuna tastes like cat food
you have done it already, no??
I never had any of these places 😂😂
I bet Jersey Mikey's wins this easily.
Damn this was a beatdown
Should’ve done firehouse instead, jj is low quality
This episode brought to you by.... Jersey Mike's.
Team Jersey johns
Hey guys just wanted to say that your message about therapy is very important, but better help is a problematic company and I think it would be a good idea to look into the ways they have negatively impacted their clients. Not upset, just trying to let you know!
I've never heard of Jersey Mike
link not wearing his bestie ring is all i can focus on idk why
Sorry, link.  That is my favorite bite of the sandwich AND the taco! 😂
Did you guys wake up today and just decide to make controversies???? I have never seen your comments so negative lol
Jersey Mike’s is the best fast food chain!! (or is it fast casual..?)
Sorry I do believe if you guys were blindfolded would give a more honest opinion ❤
Classroom Training thing is only for Store managers and its only a week in NJ.
Dude, I know you guys film these in advance but Better Help has been filled with controversy for years. You gotta stop their sponsorship, so sad to see
Link is actually pretty childish in this episode
Why did they even do this if they already knew they like jersey mikes better?
This episode is hard to watch
Link immediately jumped on my biggest complaint about JJ.. why the eff are all the toppings shoved into the breads buttcrack and not.. idk, ON TOP lmaoooooo
THE BATTLE WE ALL BEEN LOOKING FOR
both are great
Jersey Mike’s takes it. I love a wet sandwich!
I love jersey mikes too but Link is ON ONE today lmao
Link with a knife?! 😂
Trying to imagine a 14 year old working a part time job at a sandwich shop purchasing a store for 125k after three years.
So when jerseys does a hinge it’s good, but when JJ does it, it’s bad. lol can’t make it up
Bet link talks to his kids like that too!
*Who keeps giving Link anything sharp or pointy?* It must be an intern who doesn't know any better.
Link needs psychological help immediately.
Jersey Mike's vs firehouse pls
betterscam sponsor
I could've sworn they've done this fued before
I can see I’m in the minority but jersey mikes has always been so plain to me that I neeeever go there.
Jersey Mike’s vs Penn Station would have been a fairer fight.
yall having jersey mikes on my birthday is amazing (im a jersey girl)
14:07 well, guess we found the rant of the year for the year end awards...
rhetts shirt is so cool I need it
Club Lulu is my favorite!
Team Quiznos.
This is hard to watch as a resident of the northeast
They are both good in their own way. ✌️
I've never seen an episode where they blindly simped so hard for one side. Blindfolds.
Watching this I’m convinced Jersey Mikes took Mythical upon their offer to sponsor a future episode
Jesrey Mikes is good, but it’s always a wet mess.  Need at least 20 napkins to eat a whole sandwich.
You two are crazy Ya gotta have the bread hinge  I won't eat a sandwich without the hinge 😮
🤣 I love how Rhett say “ you know what I’m saying” ❤❤❤
I’ve never even been to Jersey Mike’s 😂
DELICIOUS
I'd love for you to revisit all these versus episodes blindfolded . Would be interesting to see how the scores vary from the original unblindfolded
I think firehouse or PennStation would of been a much better matchup. I love Mike’s and PennStation, like firehouse and JJ and subway are take it or leave it
man the number 9 with no tomatoes bro!!
Jersey Mikes vs Firehouse 🙏🏾
please stop promoting better help 🙄
Both are better than Subway and that's all that really matters.
Team J.J.👇
Why we dont have these in Québec 😢..
It must be stressful getting rich and having to go to the worlds easiest job everyday
Getting a colonoscopy do to you guys. Your video was very helpful.   That said let's go jersey mikes
Taco?!? But isn't a hotdog a sandwich? Same bread structure.  Come on Link! lol
What was the point of this episode?
Yeah, this episode really ain't it... this was, just an 18 minute episode where 12 minutes were Link just bitching.  It wasn't even entertaining, trying to make jokes, only bitter griping.
Wow. This episode was like if they had put Little Caesars up against a homemade authentic Italian pizzeria. Not a huge fan of this since they kinda threw JJ under the bus right away…
phew links rant 😂
I love the Philly cheese stake.
They should do these blind
No comparison jersey mikes is hands down the best
Apparently Link needs to go back to therapy
The ultimate final battle has to be Jersey Mike's vs Firehouse
I prefer real sandwiches from delis but if I’m stuck between the two Jersey Mike’s
This should have been done blindfolded. These results are meaningless. 😢
Jersey Mike's
They really should do these as a blind taste test.
FFIE, look it up
I feel bad for people that dont have a Jersey Mikes near them
STOP TAKING SPONSORSHIPS FROM BETTER HELP!
That's so messed up - "Join the army or start a business, you're already 19!"   Like, leave your kids alone sometimes.
Boo Better Help!
ITS GERMAN FOR ME TF?!?!?!?!?!?
This is like seeing my 2 some fight. I’m afraid of the outcome since I love them both so much
Better Help gets the downvote
It's gotta be jmikes and it shouldn't be close
Why did the fact that a 17 year old had over $100,000 to buy the restaurant not throw them????
I love how Link doesn’t understand how sandwiches are made
10 more years Link will have Face tattoos 😂😂
Yeah this episode has completely reinforced the idea that they need to do these blind from now on hahaha
I had jersey mike's for the first time last Saturday. I was pleasantly surprised. Except they didnt have red pepper relish (hoagie spread). Was pretty good though.
This battle isn't even close to me. Jersey Mike's all the way. So much better!
Jersey Mike's is literally disgusting. I've never had a good sandwich there.
Utterly yikes sponsor
we all know wawa hoagies are the real winner
Whiner-Whiner-Link
They honestly don't work. Surprised their southern parents pop up at times and aren't ashamed of them.
Fake news
Taking advice from Link is like listening to the kid who eats glue in the corner of the classroom
I have not even seen this vid yet but 100000% know Jersey Mike's is gonna win this with 0 effort.
When there is no other tuna than fish, you don't need to specify what tuna it is there is only one!
This is the correct way to gain sponsorship. We are watching them test and give honest critiques of unsponsored products before inviting the company to gain more exposure.
new title.. Link kisses Jersey Mikes ass for 20 minutes
Shaming people only makes them better f their feelings.
I am so proud of Link for listening to Rhett about the questions. Favorite part of the episode. ❤
Blind tasting isn't gonna work very often in food feuds especially when the 2 brands and their food are so well known.
I’m from where JJs was started and still prefer Mikes
Link actually taking big bites
Better help sells your personal data
Haven’t they done these before?
With them saying Jersey Mike's was their favorite at the start it was always going to be a massacre😂😂
I will say this, no chain conpetes with Jersey Mike's. This result is the only possible result.
I don’t need to see this to know jersey mikes is the superior sandwich
I do it like that in a roll
Jersey Mike plants, how much did they pay you!?!?!?! 😂
L sponsor
"This says Jersey Mike's in the paper and I can feel it!!" 😂
we need a firehouse vs subway
Team publix here 👇
Honestly I like them both, but you pay more at Jersey's and you get a superior sandwich. But jimmy's is still good tho.
Early and another great video
bro took the feeling placement to heart
I’m Canadian and have never tried either of these, but thanks for the info 😂
Mike's 4 lyfe
Link just eat the freaking tomato you’ve been hypnotized on this channel for it
I knew jersey mike's was going to destroy JJ!!!!!!! its so good bruh
JJ's bagel-esque bread is fan-flippin-tastic
“How might you not make a taco?”😂
Seriously? Nope wont watch.
Does anybody else have the impending doom over the fact that they are going to be on summer break soon 😭😅
These two are so disassociated from the rest of the country and what is happening its unreal, disgusting..
The episode I've always been waiting for
not even a contest jersey mikes all day everyday
I wish these guys knew how bad a company Better Health is to its patients
As a jersey mikes employee, they teach us well but they do not put us in a classroom 😭
Potbelly vs Subway next????
This entire episode is a exercise in why they need to be blindfolded.
Jersey Mikes it’s not even close
As a former jersey Mike's employee I was never trained in a classroom to make a tuna sandwich
This video will decide what I have for lunch today. No pressure lol
Both are great. Each have a unique craving when you need it.
STOP SUPPORTING BETTER HELP, THEY HAVE ISSUES THEMSELVES
Whatever Link was trying to be today, it was completely insufferable
Streaming the Mythicality tour? Heck yes!!! Thank you, Rhett, Link, and crew! Beyond appreciated. Going to be a great weekend.
Everytime yall use Better Hell-p as a sponser it makes me question supporting yall... please be ethical about the sponsors you take! Its important not to support companies that are hurtful and dangerous!!
Link has no idea how numbers work 😂
Training was not true for me haha, I did not spend 8 weeks learning how to make a sandwich, I spent maybe 8 hours
Jersey Mike's is hands down the winner in this Food Feud.
Gooooood Mythicalllllll Sandwich Battle!!! Happy Friday, beasts!
I love y’all, but STOP SPONSORING BETTER HELP!!’
Guess who’s getting Jersey Mikes today?
lol at this point GMM is just breakfast with Rhet and Link. Then you watch the more as the real episode.
Hi Rhett!
Not much competition here 😂
Link, let it go, the whole tomato thing is getting old my man.
Jersey mikes vs Potbelly next
You should try being a grown-up and stop bitching about tomatoes
This has been one of the most negative episodes I've ever seen on any YouTube in my life what you're teaching is kids and if you're going to have something you don't like don't put it on there just to criticize it you are not doing any justice to what you are talking about
better help yourself
HIII IMMM KYYYYLLEE
Where I live in Canada we dont have either of these 😢
Link, sir .... what? LMAO it was your favorite so you gave it ... a ... 0? Interesting...
Was fun until Link became a toddler.
Use this as a SPOILER BLOCKER.
Good cents is best
Before i even watch this, is it Even close? Jersey Mike's is far superior.
Please reconsider your choice of sponsorships. Better help is not horrendous.
3:13 someone messed up. JJ’s always slices down the middle.
Welp, now I'm going back to Jersey Mike's for lunch!
Jersey Mike’s doesn’t include cheese. FAIL.
well, I guess I'm getting Jersey Mike's for lunch today
Rhett going HR mode is so funny
How could you not make a taco? 🤔
Just started: No way JJ wins this. lol not even a competition After: wow! they were generous to JJ lmao
Pretty sure they already did this episode…
I knew it wasn't going to be close.
Now I want a Jersey mikes hero for breakfast lol 🥪
Anyone know some good stock picks? I picked Nvidia up, last year. Need some other great picks. Thanks!
Damn Jersey Mike's
Jersey Mike's all the way.
Oh man, the JJ Garg used to be my go to. I love that sandwich. One time I ordered it, the kid at the register said "oh, the Noah's ark sandwich? Cause it has two of each animal!" 😂
Should be done as a blind taste test with the sandwiches / items put on plates
you gotta wonder who wakes up and immediately dislikes a good mythical morning video
cheba hut clears both john and mike!
You really should do these blindfolded so things like Link’s little outburst don’t happen again. I’ve never seen someone so upset over a sandwich.
Good Mythical Morning my fellow beasties!!!! I’m indifferent and just like food. Haha
As someone with 10 years of experience working in fast food, restaurants, and retail. There is no training. The training is a lie. There may be 10 hours worth of life sucking videos to watch that you will inevitably forget within 24 hrs of viewing but that is IT. They throw you to the sharks and wash their hands of you.
I just can't fathom 19 year olds and 17 year olds having 25 grands and 125 grands. Who knows what it amounts to when adjusted for inflation
Also that I guess fun fact you could call it wasn't a fact. I used to work for Jersey Mike's we did not have to go into a classroom setting for 10 weeks. You got all your training on the job within the first week in the store.
Link SHOULD NOT be allowed to do food rating or taste testing!!!!
Jersey Mike's vs Potbellys next
No Dirk and Patty? Sad...
Get someone to replace Link when it comes to rating stuff, bro has lost the plot
Jersey Mike’s all day, every single day.  Also: this should be a blind test. Rhett’s reasoning is not in any way reasonable.
JJ Gargantuan on lettuce instead of a bun is a good 3 meals for me, it is great!
If you guys could try jersey Mike's back when it was only in jersey there wouldn't even be a contest. It was undeniably the best but it's changed and become a big company now
2:18 that is one sad looking sandwich 😂
Good mythical morning fellow beasts! 😊
potbelly's destroys both of those fine establishments
Firehouse defeats both.
This video will determine my lunch choice
JJ is superior
This episode reminds me of when Mythical Kitchen tried to do an air fryer episode.
Never been to either place
They went into this episode knowing they were going to pick Jersey Mikes. Same with episodes when peanut butter is involved.
Here early before they change the thumbnail 🙌🏼
I came to this expecting Jersey Mikes to slaughter JJ, even I was not expecting this much of a massacre.
Who else thought Rhett's hair was gone in the thumbnail?
The 8 to 10 weeks of training is just for Jersey Mike managers.
We all knew the outcome of this episode from the thumbnail. All hail JM.
Yall REALLY should stop using Better Help.......... Whoever is in charge of securing your sponsorships needs to do some research.
I'd say why doesn't Link Grow up and have better taste. His tastes are like a child's.
Having worked for JJs for 4 years before, none of those sandwiches looked incorrectly made
Europeans watching this: I don't know Mike, nor John
Well, that was a massacre.
I love Jersey's Mike's Tuna sandwich and their chicken sandwich to.
I vote Jersey Mike's. They have gluten free bread so I can eat there.
Pretty much how I expected it to go. Jersey Mike's is awesome.
Sooooo you basically said who was going to win right at the beginning. Gotcha.
The Jersey mikes here has been shut down multiple times for roaches on the food line 😂
JM>>>>JJ
Link is disqualified.
Not the better help sponsorship again; clearly don’t care about the backlash
Worked for JJS. Team Jersey Mikes
Link likes “safe places” …. Woke and pathetic
Link: “therapy is my safe place” what a BETA
Therapy …. “My safe place” WHAT A WOKE BETA MALE
Link being extra critical this Mythical Morning. 😆
This was over when i read the title. JJs doesn't hold a candle to JMs.
Team jersey as well! That classroom thing for a month and a half .. if thats true my mind is blown
I don't even need to see the episode to know Jersey Mike's is the winn
0:00 picking Jersey Mike's before it even starts let's go
Never had jersey mikes -will have to try since I now live in a no delis wasteland
Jersey Mike's
Next time the boys are in PA... we need Wawa vs Sheetz.
Why cant we change the quality of the videos lately???
As a former JJs employee. Those clubs are made incorrectly.
The top link at the end of the episode to go to GMMMORE doesn't work 99% of the time anymore. It used to work every time.
From a team member of jersey mikes gotta say love y’all for being supportive
I used to work for Jersey Mikes. Hated working there but love eating there. The classroom thing is untrue however. Walked in on the first day and immediately started making sandwiches.
Links toppings rant was a lil unhinged BUT I agree. They should be evenly distributed so each bite has some toppings in it.   Also, I’m a Jersey Mikes fan. I don’t eat there often but I usually get the cheesesteak.
The founder of Jimmie Johns is an animal poacher. Screw them.
BRING BACK PATTY AND DIRK!!!!!!! 🤬🤬🤬
I'm just going to abstain from voting in this one I'm a firehouse fan
link was taking little girl bites Lmao
We just got a jersey mikes by my work and I’m so obsessed with them! I actually also don’t love their roast beef oddly enough. But now I wanna try the Kahuna sandwich!
Rhett therapy is really working. Link not so much. 😂
They keep calling it Italian, but Italians call them heros
Epic
Never had either, none by me but Subway, unfortunately!!" 😅😆😁😃😉😏😝😜🥴🤔🤫🤭😱🤨😒🙄😨😧😲😳🤑💔❤️‍🩹❤️‍🔥🥪🥤
Why don't they count their Epic Rap Battles where they were Lewis and Clark or Renaissance artists?
food feuds and the blind taste test are my favssss
I think that’s the normal link. That’s how he yells at his co workers.
I went to Jersey Mikes years ago in Point Pleasant, NJ.  We would go down there in the Mid 1960's to spend time down by the ocean when I was a kid.
Nope…can’t even watch 😢  You can’t do a VS when they know which ones which to start with, nor be able to see.  Blindfolded definitely, touch is ok…  Now it could be X vs Y…or A B C D…either way, the boys shouldn’t know how many…just about what’s “better”
You guys really need to stop advertising for Better Help, with how many scandals they've been in and how much personal data they have stolen.
Jersey mikes oil and vinegar makes it too good lol
Firehouse is better than both.
I sent a link to this episode to a friend of mine that owns several Jersey Mike's.
Link must be difficult to work for. He seems a bit unhinged going on about sandwich toppings like he did.
Link, may, quite possibly, be one of the dumbest people on planet earth. He should wake up every day and thank Rhett for riding his coattails for all these years.
Better help L
$11.65 and $10.99? Good grief 😲!
Good mythical pleasesupportpalestine morning!
These boys need to go to a NY deli.
I don't think the 8-10 weeks training applies to the Jersey Mike's in the Atlanta airport...
16:34 …. in CT they do. 😆
Anyone else just wake up in the middle of their sleep, see the time & know there’s a new episode 😂♥️ watching now & then I can go back to sleep!!!
Every day I watch GMM, I remember Rhett donated food to Gazan children and I feel better. :)
I’ve never had both so I’ll have to give it a go one day and try them both same sandwich same ingredients and see what’s better
Why do yall continue to work with better help after what they did
Team jerseys for SURE idk if the brownie is on here but i literally go in and just get the brownie sometimes🙃
I grew up on jersey Mike's  B4 they blew up  Arnold Avenue in point pleasant nj
❤
Good mythical morning!!!!!
Unbelievable James Johnathan's hatred in this episode.
This was the easiest Think it and Sink it!
I’m here for jj slander
I love that Rhett's apology is not to the sandwich but to museums.
Should have called this episode “The Jersey Mikes Glazing episode… specifically Link”
Do They reply?
I've worked at Jersey Mike's for 8 years now. There's no classroom training 😂 no clue what they're talking about
Should still do these blind
I like both
As someone who worked at Jersey Mike's we didn't have to do classroom training
It's afternoon here, suckers
Just had a crazy thought! What about pool, or billiards! Maybe bowling, the mythical way ❤
5:26 No Diddy 😂
I saw the title and immediately knew it would be a blowout
You still supporting better-help is genuinely dissapointing, guys :/
I think this is the most one-sided food feud I've seen
We call them Rolls here in OZ.
Who clicked on this video thinking anything other than Jersey Mike's was going to win, because I knew it from the moment I seen the thumbnail
Link's frustration in the end 😂
Ive never had either, i dont even know of a JM's newr me, but ive always avoided JJ's because it really does just look sad and bland.
Stop trying to make the crew happen . They are bad 😂
15 seconds in and I can tell you right now that Jersey Mikes wins. Even if it doesn’t… it’s the better choice IMO. #31 on fancy bread!
So much of a food feud, more like a slaughter 😭😭
Wait….where is patty and her husband
I love a lopsided sandwich LINK!
Absolutely love Steve and her intro to rhett and link.
Aaaand there goes my good sleep schedule
Philly cheese steak from Jersey mikes with the cheese dipping sauce from Papa John’s is absolutely heaven.
FOUL ON THE PLAY!!! Link, we saw that, you used a knife, unsupervised! 7:59 Luckily nobody was hurt in the making of this video.
Guess I need to try jersey mikes. I've never had it but have JJ occasionally and like it.
Bring Tokyo back!  Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
I work at Jersey Mike’s as a General Manager. You’re welcome!
They let link use a knife and he was not crazy with it. Omg
We still taking sponsors from clownhelp, dope
Watching Link take bites is torture.
I love how Link is doing a full 100% coverage on each sandwich and Rhett is just going in for it like I probably would 😂😂😂
Is this a food channel? We want movie/shows videos back. Or even conspiracy theories back, and new music ❤ with love
Club lulu is a number 16 not an 8 i believe
Link chose war today
Every body knows jersey Mike's is heaven❤
where my 432hz gang at
Link’s rant was gold 😂
I order JJ Italian Nightclubs all the time and the have piles of lettuce,onions, tomatoes,etc. Where did you get that sandwich?
16:33: Link: Nobody in there right mind... at home would make a sandwich this lopsided.   I do that every time I have that kind of sandwich bread, I'm not the best at assembling a sandwich
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿 they let Link use a knife without saying anything about it
They say if you leave a comment freaky fast you get pinned…
Soooo this is when y'all post, crazy
Who actually cares what (you two) think is better? Come up with some worth while content will ya?
hi i watch both daily 'sodes every day at work, except for friday. i watch at 4 am because no work on friday!  Will there be episodes on Monday's holiday?
I'm so tired of better help sponsorships.
It sounded like Rhett said "ethic" rap battle.
Subway the real king
Okay but can they try eegee’s??? is there even one in cali idk
So excited for the episode but please stop pushing harmful sponsors. We love you guys.
I call it subology 101
Years of experience tells me neither are really even ok
Wawa over both these places!😋
This is not a scientfici taste test. Its your opinon and i refuse to let you shove that down my thraoth
Wawa vs jersey mikes
Goood mythical morning all!
Do they have Penn Stations in LA?
Now THIS is a competition I care about!
Am I crazy, or have they done this before?
Never been this early everrr😂
Good mythical morning form 🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺 it is 8:10pm here
Still saying I miss Link's old glasses. Not the Dahmer specials.
now i rlly want a sandwich
I havent watched the whole video yet but wondering if theyll mention JJ's labor practices, their ceos hunting addiction or the e.coli outbreak 👀
Jersey mikes is definitely better
Good morning!
Insert funny comment*
"WHY DON'T YOU DO THEM BLIND?! WELL BECAUSE WE CAN SEE THEM." Thanks, Rhett
Okay I need to sleep I shouldn’t be up when yall post 😭😂
LOVE FROM PUNE INDIA🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳 🥰❤😎🤝😉😍🙂❤❤🥰
