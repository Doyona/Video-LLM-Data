Who cares what the judges say? SBM knows he won, and the people who witnessed it know too. The damage doesn’t lie—it’s written all over your face after the fight. Only blind followers and haters would claim otherwise.I'll give it to Allen—he's too tough for his own good. He realized after the fight that he would never face SBM again. Anyone else would have been knocked out in the first round.Respect
This guy will get into more fight outside of sport no doubt.
Come on look at his face.  Gal lost and he knows it.  Knowone likes a rigged fight.  Sonny had no damage.  What a joke.
Gus eat your own words.
Nice win

Biggest wanker in history
Leader, Legend, thank you Captain who brought home the trophy!
Remember what Huni did to Gallen..!
Well said & well done.
Onya Gal!congrats on your excellent sporting career!well done champ!
SBW had to wait tell gallen’s almost in his 50s to fight him, he should’ve fought Gallen when he left the NRL not when his way past his prime 😂
Can't stand sonny, well done gallon
Sorry Paul, but you didn’t win, once again the Aussie ref helped like they have against the warriors 🤥
I fink Sunny Pill was win 4 da foight, s no fea da deeshishin ko 4 da udda kai! Toes fakin charchess was rip it off Sunny Pill. 😢
Look at his face 😂 got smash JBW won Gal I don’t like you cause you’re NSW blues 😂 up the Maroons xxxx
You might as well stick to an SBW (soft boxing weight).
On ya Gal. Great foot baller great boxer.
I don't know how you would call that a win.Draw was the result, both received a good pay night, no one got hurt.Retire from the ring boys before a younger person that can really fight comes after you.
In the UK there was no reporting on this fight anywhere - I had to search on youtube.  It highlights how the powers that be here de-publicise anything involving or relating to RL.
Congrats
Gallen is a nasty Person. a bad sport. I don't ever want to see his face on tv again. He should be sacked from commenting on Chennai nine. Calling SBW a dog and other names. He's a desrace to channel nine. They shouldn't support a bad sport. Who trash talks.. Get rid of him. He's not a legend. He ended up being a asshole. A nasty Person
All about money
Other people  should look at you and admire you that your real..congrats on your win and enjoy life champ
Typically, slightly,  rigged....then they'll rematch....all $$$...and $bw will return...praise to alla .or whoevers team hes on then ..
That actually reminded me of the fundora vs tzsu fight minus the blood.
Sbw punched you all around that ring how the fuck did you win,  How many officials did you pay off The whole fight was a joke Sonni bill won every round but yet this fucken box head goose wins Boxing is becoming a joke
Sonny won...have a look at yourself
Honestly gallen was doing the most hugging the whole fight but no point deduction there 🤔🤔🤔 Australian boxing 💩💩💩
Good  on ya Gallan ,  both letting  it  go was great  to  hear  this  may  have  been  a  testament for you both and  to  be  honest I  thought  you  were  a  Cocky  prick.  Now and  believe  that  those who  dispised  you  appreciate  you for  showing  respect  and  your  true  colors  shined.  Amen  Paul  Gallan honourable  man.
Gallen won fair and square
Well done the right bloke won!!
Go Gal👍
Respected to you Paul, An real men with Heart, Totally respected ✌️😉🙏
Glad Paul won and i am a  kiwi and that other guy is an embarrassment.
😂😂😂
Cheating shtz
The only fight he lost was over a game of pool!!! Legend
😂beer before coffee, and you told the world your age doesn't matter.Paul 43  trs old  Sonny 41
His FACE tells the  REAL STORY  ! ...now have a look @ SBWs  face ...only  STRAYLIANS could go against a  KIWI/SAMOAN,..bloody road killed  GALAHS  ?
Cheers
Good on yeah bloke, 👏🤙👍👌
Good on ya Paul (bolo) we all know you actually lost mate your face says it all, but hey let’s give you the win anyway cause… i dunno it looked like you might’ve cried on national tv or had really big tantrum if you didn’t get the win you desperately wanted. congratulations you won Paul 🎉🎉👏👏🙄🤣
Sonny Sooky Bill Williams
Another boxing robbery if you ask me! A draw was more fitting
they just made a shitload of cash alg
He knows inside he lost more rounds than Sonny  & didn’t deserve the win , forever a cnt
Make sure no mushroom juice snuck into your coffee mate, when you sit down together, make sure you are watching who pours it lol
Can't say I am a fan of Paul Gallen and I thought the fight was even. SWB has more class with boxing, but Paul was able to take the hits. God bless to both men
What a load of you now what. Split decision.  If you have a rematch and win maybe I'll change my mind.
It feels all better now that its over cause now the dollars are seperated and shared. The hub , Now9 Stan and the 2 boxers are laughing. It's done now lets do coffee soon and the monies are invested in their own interests. Hunky dory now. BLAH BLAH BLAH. It's all Rubbish !
I backed gal the whole fight, I felt sonny tipped him but more shots got him over the line.  All the best in retirement.
Could have gone either way, the point deduction was dubious, Gal was hitting in the breaks as well. Think gals face got tagged more ..lucky to get away with that one Gal.
Haha look at his head and tell me how he won again 🤣
Justin Hodges Vs Troy McMahon rematch please
You fkn lost the fight. Judges won it for you and you know it
This bloke is very cool
From a technical standpoint, Sonny Bill Williams failed to implement even the most fundamental aspects of his fight plan. He showed minimal use of his lead jab despite a significant reach advantage an elementary tool that could have allowed him to control distance and disrupt Gallen’s rhythm. Instead, Sonny spent much of the bout disengaging, circling away without purpose, and frequently diverting his attention to the big screens, suggesting a lack of focus and ring discipline. There was no clear offensive strategy, no consistent combinations, and very limited ring generalship. His failure to establish dominance with basic tools such as foot positioning, jab control, or effective counter punching exposed serious flaws in his boxing IQ under pressure. Gallen, on the other hand, applied forward pressure, cut off the ring effectively, and remained composed. The outcome was a direct result of tactical discipline versus showmanship. Congratulations to Gallen on a well earned and methodical win.
SBW was robbed
The man gallen n sonny thats called grabbing n holding not boxing give it up, the best man won.
Can you believe they brought COVID into it?
Sonny Who?
Sonny the cuddler
Cannot believe that you mentioned covid in 2025. Why would people still take the bogus test. You had the flu . Poor guy.
I’m glad I didn’t pay to watch the event and watched it at the club as The undercard was a snorefest except for Linde v Baker which was the fight of the night & Tersiefski v Pilcher. The guy Mundine fought was constantly making fundamental mistakes, like reaching for punches and I can’t believe he’s been pushed into the professional ranks and with the long long long build up to the main it needed to be an absolute cracker and it was very underwhelming as a spectator to watch.
As a Scotsman, everything about Gallen here is how I see ausie men - descent and humble proper men ✌️
Great stuff Gallen... Aussie Aussie Aussie Oi Oi Oi 🇦🇺🦘
I wouldn't talk about it either. He's all grown up after some sense was punched into him.
Real humility... interesting character...... hard and clean through out ....... Go Gal go son!
Big respect to Gallen rest up and enjoy family time now
Good on you Gal.  Well done mate.  Just get your teeth into NRL commentary.  You are good at that.  You have nothing to prove to anyone now.
At least give him a rematch option 😂
Wow surely he knows he got a hometown decision here
Поздравляю Пола Галлена. А избитому мусульманину надо следить за своим языком.
Gallen lost we all seen it
Win? More like Wank. Jog on gronk.
Not even a boxer champ..more a chump..But you got a nice earn. time to STFU.
No way you won this fight. A draw at best. You should give him a rematch.
SBW knows excessive holding is cheating, and the ref verified it.. Glad that Gal won as Sonny's tactics weren't honourable
Gal your both useless and you clearly got beaten
Good sportsmanship, Paul Gallen. Relax now.
As a QLDER I always backed against Gallen but I always noted how much effort and how fit he was. Once he started boxing I always got behind him cause he always put in 100% and is an amazing athlete. Well done on your sporting career mate….now have a rest
Got one over gus mate hahaha 😂 yes!!!! Pure Gold..
Good on ya Gal, you are a true legend mate 👌♥️
Gallen is a great guy. He deserves a long career in the media now. He speaks clearly and plainly and it's always entertaining when you hear him on the radio or on TV. I'm sure there will be an autobiography coming out soon - I heard that Dave Riccio was his ghost writer. In shops by Xmas????
Good on you gal. Good bloke.
You lost you got to when ref said stop you didn't aka still a grub
HOOOOWWWW THE FUCK DID YOU WIN THAT LOOOOOL 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂   BS.
He's earned his money.  Good on him .
You don’t look like you’ll make next week!!😮
A coffee with wild mushrooms for one of them?
Sonny Bill was the true winner by far .... Corrupt cronulla  judges !... Galen talking humble  but remember he's really a sook !
Gal deserve the win!!
Hahaha Go Paul, as a Samoan im so glad Gallen won..... sbw is brainwashed sob who believes in peodephile and worship a pagan evil god. Tbh i have never hated anyone that lives on this earth like this wannabe fake commentator sbw.... i just cant stand the evil on his face.
Credit for an honest review. He admitted it wasn't controversial.
Good on you gal
Who gives a fuck if you want to have a coffee together? Geez, 🥱
Awesome Paul Gallen even though I didn't favour you to win but I admire your speech congratulations Paul Gallen yes you did won it was closed fight awesome sportsmanship Paul Gallen
What a quality human.
Congrats mate!  You are tough az nails!  Lap it up mate, you deserve it‼️🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺
You lost
You don't know him that well yet you talk smack to him eighty to the fight. You lost fair and square ya money grabbing......!!!!
Who really cares about two old hasbeens .just y money hungry
Perhaps now finally Sonny Bill Williams can get lost.  Irrelevant boring twit
He's the S4mo4n B4sher. He h4s be4ten 4ll S4mo4n boxers, except for Justis Hunis.
Please start coaching ,NSW needs a coach who can say to the team,if you don’t play to the best of your ability I will beat the crap out of you,it might just work!!
Two Hood Men Now 🎉🎉🎉
Awesome career awesome athlete. Well done Paul. All the best for your future 👍
Easiest win ever.Paul was always going to beat SBW
Gallon is a wanker
Sonny Bill Williams won that fight clearly
Biggest robbery
He's tough. I was certain I would wake up to the news that he'd been knocked out.
Biggest robbery in boxing history, Refs must have been drunk fried on meth to give those scores
Congrats Gal finally it’s over and a great result
To be fair gal won that fight fair and square 👏👍💪
What happend to his face.
Sonny Bill's God is fake, and Sonny Bill Whiskas 😺 didn't pray hard enough with his fake mate Mundine to their fake god 'Allah', hence he lost.😂
Any other player SBW would have Knocked out with them upper cut hits Gallen deserved winner,
🕊️
Congratulations champion Paul good on you yeah
Sonny bill won that he got ripped off.
Holding on is not part of boxing, neither is 2 minute rounds. Williams should have been disqualified. Look in the book or the paper, Williams the cry baby lost.😢
Gallen still has to battle with Gus and his strong opinionated commentary.
Biggest robbery 😂😂
Stan did really well with the piracy. It was nearly impossible to get a live stream 😂
They both sound so brainless
How the fuck did gal win this fight
SONY BILL BY  THE LENGTH OF OF THE FLEMINGTON STRAIGHT.......GALLAN IS ONLY A PUB BOUNCER.....A SLUGGER..........NO SKILLS WHATSOEVER....AND TALKS SHIT.......IF THEY EVER FIGHT AGAIN. BIG BILL. BY KO........Talk about boxing tent judges....😬
GLEN HIMSELF IS IN SHOCK HOW THE HELL HE WON THIS FIGHT SBW HAD HIM ALL THE WAY!
Gallebn lost. He needs to give his head a wobble
SBW tried to age Gal out and still lost 😂
Well done GAL your a beast🥊
Gallery is a joke. How many of his fights have been paid for him to win.
Say thanks to Aussie judges.  Otherwise, SBW was on display. He smashed yours face badly
Seriously Gal did not win. I’m blind and I could see that.
Hahaha 😆 😆 😆 😆 😆 😆 😆 😆 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅 what happens Samoan blood 4ever and ever😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Gallen face look big injuries
What a robbery 😂😂😂
Look at that reporter tryna stir shit up clown
Both men’s physic damn man no fat there
Two older hard blokes having a crack - love it…
Mate he’s covered  in welts got rocked ffs GTFOH
You got your head kicked in just go home and recover 🤣 Sbw has already recovered and is ready for the next fight
Look at your face you got bashed and clearly you didn’t win the fight
Righto world champ 😂😂😂😂
The smaller guy wins again can’t count how many times I’ve seen smaller shorter people defeat the tall big guy if your a fighter the big guy doesn’t win as often as you think well done gal your the winner
Definitely rigged judges. Gallen lost on points, 0 head shots landed vs many from SBW to gallen.
Anyway you look at it gallen ,took on hunt that's huge
Goodonya Gal, your a fkn Legend Mate and as a sportsman you do the sports world proud.. happy retirement Champ👍
Gus is a wanker. He always backs the loser.
Is Williams still a mussy? Well done Paul, achieved your goal.
It’s simple Sonny shoulda kept the ball in his hands he was gifted by god
😂 everyone knows lololololol
Well done Paul. I've hated you your whole entire career but now I actually think your a decent bloke.All the best for your future endeavours.
Not a boxing career dude, you fought nobody’s and footy players lol As soon as you fought a boxer(Huni), you got smacked! No PPV money bro, too easy to stream free
Paul, thank you for being honest and a fair-dinkum decent man. Hope you made some decent money over your career and this fight. You are not an amateur, and sports are a short career, Cheers mate for your efforts and yourself.
Both were elite athletes. Hopefully now they can gracefully retire and enjoy their dotage.
You think he’s happy it’s over?
So SBW's religion allows such senseless violence.
He was holding and you were charge tackling and punching in the back of his head .  Should have been point deduction both ways . Another bs money making product.
SBW wont be contacting him for that coffee.
Dog.
Boxing judging again in question. The sport needs overhauling
All boxing events are rigged. What a piss poor fight... MMA/UFC is real. Will never watch a boxing match ever again
Now he has more brain damage!
Well done Paul and Sonny Bill. Class from Paul.
Respect bro.
Awesome gallen you a beast
Respect from new Zealand Paul,, well done bro
U need to have a good hard look at yourself if u paid money to watch this fight
SBW was crushed. Gallen was more strategic and smashed him. Great win to finish on.
2 flogs
Clearly rigged 😅. No idea how anyone can think Gallen actually won that.
Got covid? Ffs it’s a flu . The jab has done more damage
Another farce for a fight. I have fought 23 times. Have been in boxing gyms for years. Watched plenty. And SBW won the fight. Despite the point deducted.
I couldn’t care much about the fight, but SBW reaching out for a coffee catch up is more courageous than anything that happens in the ring
Enjoy the next 10 years until all the many hard hits will have you in a stage where you can only dribble as you try to say just your name, its not worth it to end up punch drunk in a coma....  2 men fighting in a ring produce TWO losers .... always.
Robbery.
Who won look at gallen face
That's wat a biff up does people go from hate to bury the hatchet lol
That uppercut was lethal sonny bill u liar y u keep saying u gonna win talk too much kaka not enough teke
DAM HE REPEATS HIMSELF I DONT WANT TO KEEP GOING ON AND ON 😂😂 ITS OVER ! ITS DONE!!😂
Easy to be humble and a true gentleman when you've won
Wth? I thought sbw was announced the winner
So fkn glad I didn’t pay to watch this crap.
Confusing,guess you attack a persons whole exsistence,and then your happy to have coffee.
Fmd 70 for that 😂😂😂😂😂
Sonny won that fight.. Gals a champion block but he didn’t win that fight.
They both didnt win....Gallen won
BS.😅
Don’t why they were worried about them shaking hands after the fight. Sonny was hugging Gal the whole fight!
Typical Aussie,"I don't know the man", after giving a mouthful of shit.😅
Funny how he's got the bruises an sbw has none basically tells you how it is 😂
G train 🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
Both of these men were Champions in there Time, Both Deserved the Win and Both Should be Proud of their Sporting Careers,  Now Go and Enjoy Retirement With your Wives & Children ❤ That Coffee catch up will be a good Way to make Peace ❤ Godbless both of them ❤.
1st fight I've ever seen where the supposed winner just launched hit n hope shots to the opponents armpits and won....farce
BBQ at Gallens
Yes Gallen Congratulations on a Great career and great win last night 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Legend Gallen 👐🏽 much love 2 the fanau and crew big respect to SBW 🇳🇿🇦🇺🏆🌟🥇ANZAC Sons gotta stick together Forever ❤ 💙 👏 🙌🏽 💪
He should fight Mundine next and then Pappenhausen 😮
Gallen was moaning even after he won. Sonny was the clear winner
Gallen took the fight to sonny and even though sonny was taller, heavier, younger and bigger reach, he still couldn't put Gallen away
Straight out of The Shire! Up the Nulla!!
Sonny won that fight comfortably hey
10 Years of Trash talk sorted over 8 rounds....Good on ya Paul as the humble Victor
If Sonny grew a spine and fought three minute rounds like a real fighter Gallon would have flogged him.
Love ya Gal.
robbery
SBW, the boxing joke.
Gallen v Jake Paul hehehehe
Did they send it up to the bunker to make the call ?
Paul is such a bigger man than SBW will ever be. Don't like the word humble because it gets used so much BUT I can't help it because that's what Paul is.
He’s saying his too old to get his head smashed in still
Did G Train get hit by a train ?
Sonny won this was super rigged, typical Aussies never like to lose against New Zealand, bias just like NRL 😂 honestly can New Zealand step away from these hating Aussies because they definitely ain’t no brother of ours😂
SBW thought it was a dance-off
I DONT CARE WHO WON THEY BOTH FKN LEGENDS  🙌🙌❤️❤️🔥🔥💯💯
After the fight...SBW  walked away...same thing he done to Canterbury years ago ...good one gal...your one tuff ombre
enjoy that coffee Galls
Good work gal glad you won sunny had nothing 😂
I’ve seen enough give him Anthony Joshua’s
Gallen won due to the point deduction fair call to.  Sonny was rocked started hugging after the break up.  Got a 30sec break without the Gallen would have slept him.  I'd say a draw without the deduction.
On ya Gal
Australian boxing has become a joke
Heaps of Respect Gallen your a LEGEND.
SBW is too nice to be a fighter jeez
Thats the face of a loser.
Jake Paul offered Gallon a contract what a load of bs
WWE has come to  Australian
Gallen won when rounds was 2 mins, seriously what a joke for two professional sports players who are in there 40s to box 2 min rounds. Sonny lost the fight before he put his gloves on
Get SBW off the nrl commentary for good.
I thought facial marks on Gallen compared to SBW tell the story ..Ask the Oz ex champs ,who won this fight ?
A circus show designed to extract money from people who can barely afford it. Shameful
Sonny robbed a fight is judged off damage and Sonny clearly put out more damage
Gallen - Gentlemen in the way spoke about SBW respect mate 👍😊
The Coffee catch up will Decide the True Winner 🏆  Both Athletes were both Good Sportsman on the Field ..Godbless  both of them now go Give your Full attention to your Wives & Children & Enjoy Retirement  ❤.
Imagine  if it was 3  minute round.
Put the grudge to bed Gal. Good victory mate 💪
Awesome win Bro
Oh to old now 😂😂😂😂
I don't care who won.  The real win is the respect u both had at the End.
You were too old for school boy spats 24 years ago, F’ing rugby headed bone brain
GALLEN KNOWS HE LOST🤣🤣🤔🤔🤣🤣🤣🤣GOT SCHOOLD THE DOG
SBW robbed re match
They both can retire  comfortably now.. "Break bread brother"  ✝️☪️🫡🫡
Prime Gallen would of popped him
You Muppet. He smashed your face. He is a better human than U gall. You proved that at the end when you acted like a flop.
Closest fight I’ve seen for a while. Sonny was holding on too much though.
DILLIGAF !!!
Yeah fights sold now it’s all accolades again thank truck I didn’t pay for it
Absolute Legend GAL - you done all the talk in the ring a bit like your footy career ! Sit back and relax with Family time !! Congratulations once again !!!
Good onya Paul handled like a champion respect to you enjoy that coffee and the rest of your life....
Maybe Sonny bill should’ve eaten some bacon 🥓 before the fight, he may have won if he did that! All the bacon & pork theories are absolutely B.S!  Everyone… don’t believe a word anyone tells you abt this!!
Gloves up, good fight, nothing more to chase. Kick back, chillax time.
Wow deserved PG. 👍👍
With all the bullshit they both went tbru to get a payday.. .    Both KO'd b4 the fight statted😮😮😮😮
Sonny is a top man , but unfortunately he went to the wrong "religion" .
Sonny bill is a grub just like Mundine is or worse! Both grubs & need to grow up more
Whoever knows boxing knows who won
Good to see you 2 acting like adults.
No BS with GAL enjoy your retirement from boxing
GALLEN WON!! End of damn story! Bye bye Sonny! Go cry to Mundine camp!! 🖕🏻
Sony was a bum holder all-night lol😅
Good fight Gallen. Take up golf and bowls now and enjoy your retirement
It would been better, if it where 3 minute rounds, we might had better results.
Ha ha suck up sonny bill you be always remembered as a loser  against Galen 😂
Easy work for Big Gal! 🫡
Goood for a loan now Bro's. 💰💰💰💰💰💰💰
Sonny lost respect wanting 2 min rounds. I thought Sonny won but I guess hugging too much and not allowing a slug fest lost more respect. Well done to these legends 🔥
Absolutely depleted. I like Gal and can't do SBW but calling a spade a spade, Gal didn't win the fight in my opinion, SBW was much the better fighter. Gal looks so relieved it's all over. Go home and enjoy your minions with your family mate. One tough dude.
Gallen, you outboxed outclassed and outshone him….sbw isn’t the good guy he pretends to be i I’m glad you shut him up, him leaving the ring showed his lack of class…..and the score card wasn’t fair…it wasn’t that close a win,,,you beat him well and truly …..rip sbw….
Respect gallen good bloke
Gal won the fight. Landed so many more punches
SBW should’ve been disqualified for holding gallen reverse for Nelson. What kind of weak crap is that?
It was all a show.
SBW won that, same with the Hunt fight they offered Hunt 3 million to take a dive, he lost the fight but at least didn't throw it for money. Aussies are grubs, always trying to rig everything.
Gallen got his face panel beat'n !
Great sportsmanship Gal great win 🏆
Nice win Gal.
Couple of jobs you would be good at incase you wanted a change... financial planner and Real Estate.  Because people know you and will open up doors in the future.  You are a good comunicator and still have a lifetime ahead of you.  Just couple of suggestions.
Pub fight haha
Pretty Evan fight mate good on yah gal
Gallen knows he lost that fight
Bro you lost you know it I bet if it was the other way around you be crying and you would want rematch you don’t want one now cause you get another hiding . You should have gotten a point deducted for punching back of the head
PG turns 44 next mouth [August] and SWB turns 40 next month [August]  - the old lion gets the win over the younger lion.
at least with gallen winning we just hear a reasonable dude speaking  if sbw win then its praise allah every sentence and whatever his word of the day is  yesterday it was laser focused  btw gallen won  sbw holding like a drunk x gf, cant win peo bouts like thar  he was scared of getting kod thats why the 2 min rounds  was close but sonny just looked better but gallen got more clean shots in  and controlled the ring more and the more aggressor  but like i said you cant win pro fights by holding unless you have a 5 round lead  neither did great but gallen winner  now both stay retired and have some cookies and milk
SBW pissed on him, Gal's face is a mess and he was well beaten.
As a Muslim kiwi bulldog’s memorabilia collecting All Blacks super fan I’m glad Paul Gallen won. Well done buddy!
Gal acts and speaks like a child for the entire lead up to the fight, then says he too old to act like a child.
Gallen is a proven drug cheat, how does anyone think this fight actually counts
PG made SBW his son. Pure annihilation. SBW fans are gonna say it’s rigged because they’re all sooks. SBW got beaten by a long shot, end of story. Great win, well deserved.
Yep this whole world is rigged. Living proof.
SBW kicked his ass
Up yours Gus 😂😂😂
Well done G train
Good onya Gal🤙🤙🍻
At least they're safe. One hit away from a wheelchair
Gotta give it to Gal, he’s a stand up guy.
I’m convinced the judges are from the NRL panel
People paid to watch this fight.  Got too much money
Was really surprised when they said Gallen won. Thought it should have gone to sbw
Gallen fkn whinge to much
Thanks paul, rinsed the bookies 💪
Gallen is probably the most legit footballer that has brought respect to our boxing sport! He has done an amazing job and deserves the credit.
Shame on the Samoan Bum 😂
Celebrity fights 😂😂😂😂 well done gal
I bet on Gal and won my multi but SBW was 100% robbed. I can't stand SBW and wanted to see him lose but not like that.  Gallen looked like shit, gassed by round 3, piss poor defence, couldn't close the distance and ate all of SBW's jabs/straights.
For the first time I thought SBW fought a good fight, and won. The judges are bunches of amateurs. They scored like 5 year Olds 🤦‍♂️
You talk too much shit Paul Gallen SBW won tonight
fucken kangaroo make u win big time fucken racist
From a Samoan well done Gal!! 👏👏👏  Sonny a plastic Samoan kaea! ✝️🙏
Good guys, respect to both.
Great sportsmanship
Just won or did u?? Lol
Glad Paul Gallen won. Screw SBW
He’s sounds like he knows he lost deep down , we need lie detectors in boxing
What a fucking back step from all the mouth this week Gallen both grubs
Dude has done well for a league player apparently he has made $20mil in boxing.
You were out boxed Gal....stich up mate.
Paul Galen such a good guy I don't know what sbw probably was sbw needs to relax and stop grand standing we know sbw likes to think he some kinda religious try hard I do you think god will jump in the ring and punch another person in the head?
Gallen lost. It's a stitch up.
Both are going to have coffee together one day, Lol..😂😂😂
Onya Gal
Salty SBW fangirls in the chat. Suck it up ya big bunch of 🐑 bangers.
Shot Champ. 💯
Gd fight both of uz. gallen most humble man bro. he not celebrating tat he won he jus glad it ova an done wit. he can't wait to hav coffee wit sbw. dey both gona b gd buddy frm this moment on
Anyone who actually paid for this has lost their marbles
SBW won that.
If youre not Australian you aint gonna win
Ah yes catch up for a coffee…Columbian coffee,devils dandruff,sugar booger!
Happy retirement Gal. SBW will be returning for another trash talking fight 😂😂😂 U P THE BLUES 💙
Woohoo, barbecue at Gals place, bring your own meat!!!
Sonny Bill won that fight. Absolute joke. Rigged 💯.
Gal won . Those body shots took their toll . SBW just lucky it wasn’t 5 years ago or he would have seen lights out .
Congratulations Paul Gallon. Kiwi.😊
Gallen whooped that boy!!! 👏👏👏💪💪💪💪💪
ONYA GAL !!!!
Good to see Gallen win. SBW is the most annoying commentator I've ever heard. He was full of trash talk but got silenced in the end, thank God. Gallen's win makes NSW loss in Origin a little more bearable
Great fight, good hype, good interviews, really like Danny Green.
Good one Mr Gallen well done im a kiwi and I had your corner 👍🏼 blimmin proud i did matey ☮️
Youd have to be impressed by Sonny.... fought the only way he should..... Gal pushed forward throughout... was closer than expected
cool Paul letting the past go shot man thats the winner for me
😂😂😂😂😂
He doesnt look like a guy that thinks he deserved the win
Take the money and run...
Good on you Gal good to see You get the win, enjoy your retirement you deserve this
100% Correct decision -- the boxer that always wants to hug will never win the fight.
Great example of Australian boxing. Hate to say it but white man always has to win.
I went for gallen but SBW won, but sonnybill dont care cause they got paid, you can see it
Respect Paul ,❤ very well done. Australian at its finest
Theres always going to be people saying the other dude won. Especially when religion is in the mix.
Thought it couldve went either way. SBW landed the cleaner shots, look at Gals face compared to his but Gal landed some heavy body shots. Guess it goes to show you can win a boxing match by not  punching to the head.
Well done Gal ,I had you up.
Well done brother
Well deserved GAL 👊
What happened to your face m8😂😂😂
Those yt ozzie judges would neva let a nz muslim win
It hurts to see you tear each other on telly glad its over now...Happy Retirement Boyz
LEGend Paul Gallen…. enjoy retirement 💙
I think that was the sharks 2025 nrl G.F lol 😂
They made their peace, go have that coffee boys...life's too short for hate...
Steroid cheat
You’re lucky I let you win like we agreed
Mate , you've got  SBW colours/ claws .. all over ya face  ?
Not calling sonny a grub now I think he’s scared the shit out of u n you are the weak one for asking him he really wanted to do this before the fight I never ever asked anyone that before a fight in ring or street
How’s  all the polys in every comment section about this fight 😂😂
Gallon vs Jake paul
Sonny won
What a ridiculous speech,  what ridiculous questions.. All a joke
Look at his face 😂
I was there for the fight was a great night 2 minute rounds was a joke but it is what it is
Boxing is a mugs game. I hope no kids look up to these clowns
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Probably the most embarrassing judge decision. Sorry to say. SBW should have won. It's as clear as the ice.
Yes Gallen 💪🏽💪🏽 now go have a coffee ☕️ with the bro well done with win 💪🏽💪🏽
If you know you know.
SBW won.
Good onya gal gr8 win sale off into the sunset champion
SBW didn’t win. WtHell is everyone on about
GALLEN GOT SMASHED 🤣🤣🤣
As a Queenslander & Broncos fan this was the first time I wanted Gallon to win. Enjoy your retirement mate!!
Robbery! SBW should've won wtf?
Gallen knows he lost , his face knows he lost , the ref knows he lost , X boxers said he lost , and most of all S.B.W knows he really won , that's all that matters
May God bless you both former Rugby Legend 🙏♥️
SBW beat Gallen. So did Barry Hall. Seems like Gal had tge promoters and judges in his pocket.
This is the first interview of Gallen that I've thought he's not a bad bloke finally. We all pull it up at some point and it's remarkable he's gone to 44. I'm Maroon through and through, but I hope Paul Gallen has a great retirement and that his health holds up, especially with chronic pain and injuries. Although, he's pretty bloody good considering his just taken down the much larger man, SBW.
RIGGED
I had SBW up on my score card but good to see Gal get the win. Good on both guys for finally getting it done.
Not a great fight to watch but I think a fair decision was made sbw played it to safe and paid the price it’s a fight Gallen wanted to but was held back to much crap fight good decision
I'm british and paul gallen won this fight
It was over for SBW once he walked out with the Palestinian flag 🇵🇸
😂😂😂😂
You go toe to toe and trade shots it's a fight. If you choose to cuddle and hold then you're scared and cheating
It reminds me of the Ellis vs Michael's fight. Yeha Lester got more head shots but Michael's got him on the body more and the reality is you can't hold and cuddle that's a sign of weakness in itself Just go toe to toe
🐐 🐐
God bless you Paul! Sunny got deducted because that's his character no honesty. Your a true Aussie with true grit your honest and a straight forward man of your word.
Typical Danny Green promo SBW ROBBED! what a joke gal you did nothing to win that fight
Allah wasnt ther this nite 😅
Good fight, sonny clearly won, i had him up 5-3 and couldve been one more. Just look at thier faces, sonny took some nice ones to the body, but wow, what a ridiculous scoring, real shame... Thats boxing i guess, makes me sad
His face tells the story.. and his body language is telling
🤣😂All the Gallen supporters... SBW won that fight 100% and l didnt even watch it
You know what would have been good. Sonny Bill no fear all warrior just fuckin smash him double time once and for all because why not yall retiring may the best man win. Smashed him bro big ups SBW obvious win 👍
This is why you shouldn't pay for such a farce and scam
MORE LIKE TOO SCARED TO REMATCH! RETIRE YOU WEAK DOG
Lets hope that this is the final fight...good on both of them
What a champion Gall! Thank you for showing such great heart as a  fighting sportsman.
He aint for coffee
Typical Aussie sport, cheat at every sport possible, knew it would be rigged. Plain as day. Can tell by their faces for a start. Underarmers. I
💯SBW WON!!
Like him I get to retire at 44 our generation is lucky get to retire 🤑 bless being born in 80s we are the chosen generation everyone else will have it hard especially the new generation 😁 good on U gallan..live ya life brother
How did he win? Barely landed any shots. Should of stayed retired
Looks like he's got COVID
A stan sport commentator vs another stan sport commentator. Brought to you by stan sport.  Yeah don't believe this shit is real for a second
Sonny won the fight clearly even danny green said that , i think it was rigged the end decision, they were letting gal win no matter what , gal you lost mate
What a fuckin joke mann, ahh well good on yas for takin some shots i guess ... 🤯
Hate each other now it’s time to kiss and make up.. Talking shit
robbed
After a career of getting absolutely demolished by Queensland it's nice to See the old bull get a win at something.
fair dinkum
Enjoy your retirement champ 👍🏻
No job done 🙈❌
But are you happy it’s over?
Gal lost that n he knows it. SBW robbed.    How many times has he mentioned his age guys? Lol. Flop
Just a humble champion and a true competitor good on you, Paul.👍👍👍
Absolutely disgusting 🤮  This was not needed . Paul u look destroyed. Go home be happy look after bur kids . Congratulations u won but …… just . Sonny was to strong for you really look at you . Don’t do this nonsense again  Sonny never really wanted to do this . And No I’m not a ‘ Williams fan at all ) u can just tell
He stopped because it's rigged,  both liars
Australian Boxing is a disgrace. Boxing Judges and commissioners are bullshit.  This is exactly why Australian Boxers have never made it and never will to the big leagues.  Can’t be trusted.
Biggest bullshit fixed fight 😂 he didn’t land a decent shot on Sonny.
Coffee. Youd rather a juice Gal...?
SBW robbed
this guy doesn't shut up 🤣🤣🤣
The only way Gallen was gonna lose was if he was paid to take a dive.
Money grab
Good onya, Gall! Job well done!  💪 👍 see, if u actually get that coffee ☕️, 👍
Haha asking about the paided per view money already?
CJC-1295 &.GHRP-6 is the real winner of the day.  Bro you got well beat.   What a farce
Na deep down gal knows he lost that's why he was sookin at the end of the fight
coffee really 😂 ... You know you lost, mate, like you said but but JUST EMBARRASSING  FOR AUSTRALIAN BOXING WOW
Thought sbw will smoked him🤦🤦🤦🤦up the blues 💙up Gal💯🙌
Up up the King of Cronulla 😊
BS🤦🏽‍♂️
Good payday, boyz
Glad these guys want to bury the hatchet, and get along.
An embarrassment to Australian boxing both of you.
