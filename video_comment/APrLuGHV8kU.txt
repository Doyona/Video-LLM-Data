Pushup name
A good pushing and core workout but nothing to work the "pull" muscles.
Let me translate if you are from Britain: "Press up"
that's about 10 push ups per rep!!!!!
Push-ups single handedly fixed my posture
Bro missed the nipples.
@melvinbrat
💪💪💪
They remixed the terry crews method
Too many touches for different parts of body. Easy to foget. In India better type of push ups .and its develop flexible of spin and endurance.i make push up on fingers,fists ,palms and on one hand and recently start to make India wrestlers push ups.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
So I counted 10 pushups. So 15 of them would be the 150
💯🤝🏾
So thats 1 rep, and I need to do 150? MF WHAT
That's 1/10 of a rep ☠️
Made it look so easy. Beast.
Facile 😂😂😂
Everything cool but what is the point of doimg a squad in this combo?
Bro looks like a spaghettie
کامان بچه شییییییر🗿🦁

"Do 3 sets of 50 squats!"  "Thats easy sarge!"  "But here's the catch..."
😊
The only mod I’ve made to this is 10-20 squats at the end of each rep to get 100-200 squats in.
Пиздец
🥱
Boring.
that's real.....hard, but the results are awesome
Next set will include "push up Chuck Norris 😮
Add this for what again
Adding this to my dip bar routine. I’m 28 now. By the time I’m 32 I’m hitting a flag pole
Hell nah 😂
I feel so proud to see People doing what they love😊
Is that one rep... ?
Motivation kings let’s go
When he said "Mike Tyson" I knew this was going to be chaos, busy and painful, and certainly feel like forever for the subjects. 😂
Це що за чорне засилля?!
Never see anyone do more than the 1😅

💯🤴🏾💪🏾💯🤴🏾💪🏾💯🤴🏾💪🏾💯🤴🏾💪🏾
I thought burpees were hard till i saw these
I think this should be a revolution in the black community so kids can become their best selves instead of eating that crap at the corner store and violence among themselves. Let’s do this and change the narrative and the game !!
That's what I'm talking about young bucks. Get ready for WAR. If you stay ready. You don't have to get ready. 🤨👍😎
This looks fun,imma do it right now
I'm holding in some good ethnicity jokes about this video 😭
150 of those 😮 or 15? Cuz each one is 10 pushups. Reguardless that will definitely put seperate you from the competition

Can you imagine being so hard that a pushup is named after you
I would do some more squats
i wanted to ask in a comment to see yall do as many of these as possible in a video.
@VTaylor...You have Fallacy of Many Questions (or Plurium Interrogationum) because the topic is oral and written tradition and whether its limited to the apostles...instead your all over the map asking about the trinity, the issue of the canon etc, each question which is complex enough to spend several weeks and months on. So I will ask you a follow up where does Genesis 3:15 say that because enmity between the woman and the serpent therefore Mary is sinless and lived a sinless life? You are just assuming the very thing you are suppose to be proving.. This is called a fallacy of begging the question.  You assume Genesis 3:15 means sinless Mary and therefore Romans 3:23 does not mean All have sinned with the exception of Jesus in context...instead you add an additional sinless exception that Paul makes NO MENTION of. Ask yourself this...would you assume and get out of the text of Genesis 3:15 that Mary is sinless by just reading the text? Of course not instead the Catholic church (or Catholic  apologists) have suggested you to read it to mean that even though it says absolutely nothing about Mary being sinless. But if you read Romans 3:23 in context absolutely you will come to the conclusion Paul is teaching ALL of humanity have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God with the exception of the one both man and divine...the man Christ Jesus. As for your canon question it makes no sense as of course you believe all Scripture is breathed out by God right? 2nd Tim 3:16...so the divinely inspired Scripture is written down and it matters not that it took a period of time for Christians to RECOGNIZE what God had already given. Psalm 119:89 Forever, O LORD, your word is firmly fixed in the heavens.  But let's ask yourself another question because you must admit Paul Says in Scripture do not go BEYOND what is written.  So if he is not talking about not going beyond Scripture than what do you think he is talking about? Paul even says Scripture makes one COMPLETE i.e 2nd Tim 3:15-17 how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 16 All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, 17 that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work. Catholics like to argue Paul is only talking about old testament here (because its since Timothys infancy it must be old testament). At the time of writing 2nd Timothy Paul is about to die (he says so in book of Timothy) so we know all of Pauls writings have already been written and almost all of Scripture had been written by then with the possible exceptions of a few books like John or Revelation (depending on when you date those). But if you say its the old testament in reference that makes the case for.the sufficiency of Scripture even stronger because you would have the text 2nd Tim 3:15-17 saying the old testament Makes complete, wise for salvation, equipped for every good work, etc. Indeed . Jesus fulfilled over 300 prophecy concerning himself in the old testament and the old testament people we're looking forward to the coming Messiah. And to answer your question on the trinity the Scripture absolutely gives us enough information to believe in the trinity ...ask yourself this question you actually think the apostles did not believe in the trinity and nobody knew about the trinity until the council of Nicea in 4th century?...1. One God, One Divine Nature:  The Scripture consistently emphasizes that God is one (Deuteronomy 6:4).   This oneness of God is understood as a unity of divine essence or nature.   2. Three Distinct Persons:  The Bible identifies God as Father, Son (Jesus Christ), and Holy Spirit.   These are distinct persons, not just different manifestations of the same person.   Examples include the baptism of Jesus (Matthew 3:16-17), where all three persons are present.   The Great Commission (Matthew 28:19) also refers to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as distinct entities.   3. Shared Divine Nature:  While distinct, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are described as sharing the same divine attributes and glory.   They are all called God (John 1:1, 14; Acts 5:3-4).   Genesis 1:26 Then God said, “Let US make mankind in our image, in our likeness..  They all participate in works of creation and salvation.   For example, Jesus claims to be one with the Father (John 10:30), and the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ.   This shared divine nature is what allows the three persons to be considered one God. Another example of what Im talking about with dont go beyond what is written is the Bereans. They studied the Scripture day and night to identify whether or not what was BEING SAID by Paul ORALLY was true. Acts 17:11 Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.
I’m allergic to exercise, how this end up in my feed?
Can chest be tigjten without be bigger?
26th reps Daily
I can't even do a REGULAR pushup. That's my fault now lol but.. THIS shows me WHY... And I'm bout to start hitting the gym but I will NEVER hit these😂
ALL Y'ALL FINE ❤❤❤💋💋💋💋💋
Sounds like a male orgasm party.
This THE gayest thing I've ever seen
I cant even do one push up 😅
the first century source for trinity is Scripture...and most Catholics don't understand that because they dont study Scripture in detail enough instead they want to appeal to their church as if we would not know God is Triune without their say so. several Fathers denied Marian dogmas that's not even in dispute...someone like William Albrecht cant be taken serious as a good faith actor...the fact is we dont see Marian doctrines on the scene until a  significant period of time after the apostles...so again its very simple... if the teachings are oral from the apostles show me where it was passed on mouth to mouth from the apostles in an unbroken chain. You just admitted Fulgentius taught the flesh of Mary is sinful and because of her parents...this is precisely what the Catholic dogma of Immaculate conception denies...Catholic belief that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was conceived WITHOUToriginal sin. This means that from the moment of her conception, her soul was preserved from the stain of original sin, which is believed to be inherited by all humans due to the sin of Adam and Eve. The idea that as to whether Mary lived a sinless life is a seperate issue but you conflated the two.  You are trying to do mental gymnastics...also your timeline doesn't even make sense...Fulgentius was 6th century and original sin was something Augustine had robustly taught in the 4th century. So to claim they didnt know or were not talking about original sin in the 6th century when it was already established is silly. You are trying to play wack a mole and stop the leaks in your sinking ship. ALSO Fulgentius was an African bishop not an eastern bishop as you FALSELY claim. Africa is part of the western church not the Eastern as you FALSELY claim.
The apostle Paul literally says dont go BEYOND what is written.  Again you are looking for the exact word for word which is arguing like a muslim...Muslims say "where does Jesus say I am God worship me" and likewise you are asking where does it exactly say word for word tradition is limited to apostolic. It is assumed in the very apostolic authority Paul has...when he says dont go BEYOND what is written and hold fast to what WE taught...ipso facto he is not advocating that you hold fast to doctrines and traditions he/the apostles did not teach.  And again he didnt teach Marian dogmas...he specifically says ALL have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23) and his context is absolutely that Jesus is the ONLY exception for humanity because he is the sinless savior (this ipso facto leaves Mary as not sinless in Pauline theology). Romans 3:23 alone is enough to prove sinlessness of Mary is not apostolic teaching.  So to hold Mary sinless is to go against the Apostle Paul in Holy Scripture.
several Fathers denied Marian dogmas that's not even in dispute...someone like William Albrecht cant be taken serious as a good faith actor...the fact is we dont see Marian doctrines on the scene until a  significant period of time after the apostles...so again its very simple... if the teachings are oral from the apostles show me where it was passed on mouth to mouth from the apostles in an unbroken chain.

That's so amazing
I’ll be doing one rep a day
Basically fancy cardio, I like it.

Euro training! One! 😂

The only reason why you would need a job
Колония?👀
doing this many pushups is retarded, go bench some weight
He motion, I got lotion...We are not thr same
I think it’s good to add 6-8 slow squats to allow your upper body to recover from such a load of reps.
I might complete 2 reps in one go and stretching to 3rd half😂. But going 10 of them straight would be a huge problem 😅
I dont understand the hate. Imagine hating and being a racist to black people but then proceed to learn from them and all. *smh*
😂😂😂but look at them 😜 they're all cut and healthy looking 🎉🎉🎉❤
Yeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh......💯💯💯💯💯
Anybody that actually works out no you need to do all this for a push-up. This right here is just for show and to look like you’re doing something. Stupid. Jail push-ups are stupid too. You don’t need to be hopping up and down like a bunny rabbit to get some reps in.
Excelente vídeo
Monkeys at the dogpark
I can smell the testosterone from the screen
I did 3 reps and I’m cooked. What’s good for reps in this workout?
My favorite part of this video is the encouragement rfom the instructor and the fact that everyone is moving at their pace to complete the exercise. I Did ONE to try and it ain't a joke. It's solid af! I'm 303lbs but fairly strong, so I'm gonna start out with a single set of 5 to get into it and progress into more reps as I get stronger. Great to do when taking a break from gaming/working on my computer for hours.   Sidenote: What was the event that assembled all these sexy men in one place...asking for a friend?

I’m a sort of shape. I don’t know if I should even be doing this, but I really like how simple and straightforward it is. That being said when I was trying to do them from memory today, for the first time, I totally missed the swing toe touch And I just tried to toe touch like you touch your knees. 😂
And only one squat....... LEG DAY EXISTS MORONS
This is a prison work out

Whoever yells baby boy in the background is “gay”.
Beautyfull farm, but where is the cotton?

Skinny and cut doesn't look right to be and never have,I thought these wer girls when I first clicked video,get your weight up fellas,skinny is not power.
Damn shit remind me of jail almost off parole can’t wait to hit the beach and get some nice views and a strong body and mind can’t nobody beat u

“Oh yea baby boy” 😂😂😂
I’m still trying to push up. I need the decaf speed 😂😂😂😂😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
ONE!
Hustle it out, warfighter. America is the best war tribe.
Ten of these is a great goal
IF they only spent this much time trying to better society or come up with some business ideas the world would be a better place.
Black top work real 🫡
Imagine doing all that and still getting your ass whooped. Learn how to fight kids get in some sort of martial art. Muscles won't save you in a fight.
💯💪🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾Buenisimo excelente si o si 👍🏾
In order for me to do this i need to be at least 160lbs,being over 240lbs is impossible for me to do it
Dope
Cool 😎 what prison are they incarcerated at?
Don't miss leg day.or lower back.
Que carcel es esa
Mike tyson is kinda sus
Now usually I don't do this but....................................I QUIT😂
great one, tried it today appreciate this video
Wrong form pushups
Startin them fast i think is what burns them out
15 sets back to back is Beast Mode
Mann doing these is no joke two reps and I was done 😂. Now I’m getting better I can do 5-8 now. Ngl doing this reminds me of Michael on my wife and kids when he was training with terry chews “one”🤣🤣🤣
Thats a good prison to let inmates work out
That's a great rep lotta boys behind the door do these sort of exercise!%%% ain't saying this fella been away it's a GREAT WORK OUT !%%%%
It hurts watching this. Gains through pain is the only way.
Head shoulders knees and toes knees an toes head, shoulders, knees, and toes, knees and toes and eyes and ears and mouth and nose, head, shoulder, knees, and toes, knees, and toes
No cap, I’m a pretty in shape dude and I’ve tried this yesterday….my shoulders were on fire, I was gassed, but I loved it! Compound exercises are a beast….theres levels fellas let’s break them!
Man just do some regular pushups
Great cardio...
I gotta try this
Not gay at all.......
No legs in sight
Is there  female version of this?
I heard someone said DAMN towards the end of the video.. Also its the hype man for me.. YARD WORK, THAT YARD WORK, OH YEAH WE GOT MOTION!!
Yet there is no mission or objective or goal for the world....  Kinda what we talk about  Looking for praise instead of doing things worth praising.....  Spends all day in the lockerroom just to run onto a 44 ......😂
I did only this exercise and squats with resistance bands. I went from ewww to wow in about 3 months.
These guys are ready for the fields
So many of them are doing it incorrectly lmfao. Doing the tyson before the toe touch hahahaha
Which muscle groups does this exercise affect?
Young kings working
Yeah .. umm .. I’m in great shape with videos and a channel to prove it.  I’m not doing ANY of this 😂😂 .. HELL NAH
Just pure stupidity 😂
How much reps and sets ??
Wow, i will do this for 30 days 👍💪
I would die after just 1 rep
I’m just laughing at the dude with a ski mask on lol 😂 gggggggg gangtaaaaa
Push up touch your ass
Why do they call that a Mike Tyson?
Monkey yard
Small
I wish I had the energy to do all of this plus I’m fat.  I’m kind of defeated.  I really want to but just can’t.  My body won’t obey me anymore.
What shoe is this?
I'm definitely not doing this but imma keep watching.. 🫠😂😋
Yeah I’m good lol
Affletes
this wont do shit why squat that doesn’t do a damn thing and the full lockouts yeh triceps and shoulders your chest doesn’t receive enough damage you gotta do halfs with push up for the chest
My problem is I can’t do a push up and think I can do this 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I heard the shorter "that's one rep" version just the other day and thought "Ha, yeah right! Can anyone really do more than one of those?"  I'm dumfounded. I can barely do one normal push up without elbow and wrist pain, despite having the supposedly correct posture.
Why’d he push his ass out when he said Mike Tyson? 🤔
The single squat💀
Gosh I did 20 crawl outs today. I hope My trainer doesn’t see this video 😂
I tried it i end up farting
How many should you do lol
One squat is hella imbalance if you only do this one exercise
This will do nothing but deform your body. All these guys go to gym and lift weight
Damn
Bellissimo allenamento con un bellissimo gruppo 👋👋
I’m out of fuckin breath just sitting here
That's one rep 😂
I will MASTER this!
Mike Tyson? Lol
Thats a nice ass full body work out
Strength and stamina and you only need a tiny space! Awesome :)
Never skip leg day.
crazy routine, respect
... Maybe the gym can wait one more day...
Kinda reminds me of 8-count bodybuilders...they were my fave when I learned them in the military! Now? Not so much...😂
O wanted to say that me to much stupid .. me just to much stupid nu … but the true is pedofil house
太扯啦
Push up, touch your meat
West Point !

Wait so how many reps are we doing again?  100.  And thats the first one?!
Black people are built different
This what I need to do right here out there with them.
Is all of this really necessary? 🤦‍♂️
Ladies and gentlemen what we call a jungle gym
Чорна робота
I wanna be able to do this I need motivation Like maybe a coach 😆 😔  And alot of prayer 🙏
Them boys putting in work 💪🏾
This is was up 💪🏽 go get it gentleman go get it 🫡
I was just in a car accident last year and I can't do push-ups anymore😢
Damn how many set we have to do we be all day messing with him smdh
Don't believe him everyone want to be  a professional Trainor nowadays especially black people
I'm looking at this from a purely scientific viewpoint, and touching different body parts wastes energy while working nothing under resistance....its like doing a barbell curl and then shaking your leg then a barbell curl and shake your other leg then a curl and shake your ass then curl and do a head rotation. Set down the barbell  squat don't again...just do your curls/pushup without any break between reps and then do a FULL set of squats... not just ONE. That would be a more efficient use of tike and energy while making each specific exercise more intense.
"Today, somewhere in the world, someone is training to kill you. What are you doing?"
This is more difficult to remember rather than doing 😂😂😂
Is this at UMD
See they remember all that but cant remember stealing is bad
"And that's one people "😂😂

Everybody's on their first rip😂
Love the work, been doing this in my routine since I saw them the first time. Keep grinding.
This is leaked exclusive rare footage of the 'Black Panthers' getting ready to take over Maine.
I would find this sexy if I wasn't more amazed that everyone saw this once and not only remember it but did it so fast and almost in unison.  The memory. I'm getting the body to move is the head part, of the shoulders knees and toes, right?
Guess what i will be doing real soon
Well well well
What do we got here
Well well well
1 freaking squat after all those push ups?!? Chicken legs for all those following this routine
His controlled breathing as he demonstrates the excercise is crazy!!❤❤❤
what counts as one ? each pushup or the end of the routine/movement where he crawls up and squats ?
If you can do it 5 times in a row in a perfect form ,then congrats , it mean you are a powerful person
Next gym session I’m dedicating 1 hr to see how many I can do
He's 🔥🔥🔥
I will continue to watch but I won't do it 😂😂😂🎉🎉❤❤you go boys
2019 wc mai dekha na rohit ne kya kiya but usko pata hai personal milestones matter nahi karte trophy karti hai, ipl ki bhi aur icc ki bhi, No hate to Kohli he's goat but people really forget Rohit is also the goat 🐐.
This shit get you right, I’m finna start back doing these
I can't even do a push up, 😢
This routine is based in the "Sun Salute" Dynamic Asana from Hata Yoga. There is some levels of every posture and this one is one of the most advanced secuencies.  Yoga and Chi Kung, can be intense as fuck when we go deep in the matter.
gettin ready to collect their welfare checks
10 flexiones una sentadilla, ya entendomes por qué los calistenicos tienen piernas de pollo
Crazy how doing all these PUSHUPS together only counts as ONE SINGULAR REP! Like I can't even do a pushup properly and end up straining my shoulders too much 😎😭
Beast mode that's powerful
Eats lots of food to😊
Wow my hero
Finally came across the OG 8 months later
Not a calf or quad was found 😢
I started today thanks--new push variations unlocked
Yesterday I went to the gym and today I'm very sore, but I still tried this exercise right now and it's crazy man, I'm going to add it to my routine and training fr 🔥🔥🔥

150 of those? Stamina and strength endurance is insane. I need to stop fuxking around and get in shape bro.
I hate when people hit the genetics lottery thinking they’re actually working for it
Wh that squad? Your chest collapses before your quads are even warm.
I can’t keep going on like this mannnnnnn🫠😭😩
This would drive me insane. But imma do it. Cause I know it gets you ripped as fuck.
OKAY !! 👍👏

It’s funny how many haters in here ragging on the instructor just because he can do something they can’t.
Do you know how much all of this hurts? I do. I do
Now that's a routine.

This guys can take over my country😅
Dope exercise.. but that one squat you put in there is so pointless.
They training for Black Panther and taking over the White House 😅
They ain’t do none of that shit 😂 Sometimes simple is better. Niggas get some muscle and start turning into Terry Crews Euro Trainers.
💪🏿✊🏿👍🏿
You all should do some Martial Arts, Boxing, Wrestling, etc… put some use of all these push ups. Hung Gar Kung Fu. Just a suggestion
Bad chef @1jamaicanchef go check him out ‼️
Why do they wear gardening gloves ?! 😂
HOTTIES ❤❤❤❤

Warming up for a day of stealing

This video is like, 17 hours long...
Tips is don't rush, never rush ,and do a proper warmed up

"Oh yeah we got motion baby boy."  Diddy prolly 😂

I like how it’s like 10 different reps for upper body and then one bodyweight squat at the end lol
Thats gay
Do the roll over pushups
20 reps will have you looking like magazine dreams
“We got motion baby boy” HUH?!? 💀💀
Вот как оказывается тренируются порно актёры😂😂
What gloves are they wearing?
1 rep is enough 😂
Relax
How many reps ? To do
He made that look smooth and easy ❤💪❤😮❤😂❤
Tried it and it was harder to remember the steps than do the push up had to rewatch like 4 times lol
This is why physical education is so important. It isn't limited to one culture or whatever these weird racist comments are. young men should all be exercising regularly, motivating each other, and staying productive. White, black, Asian, Latino, who tf cares? Get outside and exercise.
"push up mike Tyson"💀😭 Edit: thanks for 100+ likes
One white token, lol
So, How much for one?
"push up mike tyson"
Go home and do it 😂😂😂
Ok
A while back I would have said nahh I’m good. Just tried it and thought, I gotta do more of these.   Thanks kings adding to my workouts
Smells 1800s
I’m exhausted just from watching it.
That's one rep!💀
The instructor looks emaciated 😂
149 to go
*Weakass*
Prisoners coming out more dangerous 😅😅😅
Plot twist: They have to be back in their cells for lunch.
So while you're down there and you happen to see a little cotton..

This is a physical AND mental exercise. At least for a person who never exercises
This a good one here boy!
Impressive
Why They all niggas
"Mike Tyson"? Nah, bro. That's called a "Diddy".
I started this 3 weeks ago every morning 4 sets of 10 and evening after work. My frame has become so solid and I can feel the extra energy in my breathing and the way I walk. Thx
Diddys favorite video on youtube😂
What in the world Sir I can’t even get myself to the floor  Wowwwww
I didnt know Diddy running the program now 💀 aww yeah we got motion baby boy 😂😂😂 yo that's not sweat that's baby oil 😂😂😂
Dudes be just trying to show off, bet there aren't boxers that actually do these, these are for prisoners with nothing to do 😂
Too much 😂 i rather just do pushups, weighted sit ups, squats, knee & calf lifts
He made it look so easy
💯👍
“How do you walk to work?” “I walk by doing push-ups”
Just by watching it hurts 😬
Instructor must weigh 140LBs because with the ease he does this at, you'd think his physique would be more sculpted.
Average day on the yard in any American prison:
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Shit when did Djanjo 2 drop
What if you give it a twist at the end instead of squat what if burpee
...That's one rep.
Doesn’t leave his finger prints around, smort 🤓
Yeah. I'm trying to do 5 push ups without needing a break. Two weeks ago a couldn't do 1.
🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
I started these a month ago to add with my regular routine, and I definitely can tell a difference in strength and endurance
That shit hard for real
this is that guy in the movie who takes a rag tag group of losers and takes them to the championship
They say them men don’t get alone who said so it’s Mike Tyson for me
I would be dead by the 5th😅
My shoulders could never 😢😢😢😢
I would forget the order
Who tried it again like me?😅
🤡🤡🤡🤡
Mike Tyson ❤
Hard
So many half reps
the group doing it as fast as they can all had poor form  do it slow and smooth
Very good 👍
"Yea that's one rep" - Terry crews Eurotraining
If you already do push up and have good stamina this shouldn’t be too hard 👌🏾🔥
How many reps?
Right... almost got it. One more time!
Luh baby luhh
I dont know, im going try this out... He to cool!
99.9% upper body and .1% lower body with that one squat😂
Why is it called a Mike Tyson
Mfs doing too much trying to invent their own workout
the instructor is crazy omg
Sucht euch Arbeit
Yeah but he is part of the darker culture so it doesn’t really count.
💪🏻🫂🔥🥵
I just did 5 and Im done, respect  to these gentlemen 💯
I’m just gonna save this, and do it next three years. Maybe 😂😂😂
Im scared to do workouts with park boot camp instructors. I might as well enlist 😅
"Thats one rep" 🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
"Drop and give me all your money and valuables!"
Do they expect you to do more than 1 of these?
How did they remember all that
Oh i get it - head shoulders knees and toes knees and toes!
EUROO uh TRAINING uh EUROO uh TRAINING, that's one
All the chunkies on here trivializing the mans skill. " He in shape" " he lean" " easy when you're light" . It ain't easy.
I saved this 🎉
This is my warm up 😴
He ain’t nothing to f**k with … his movements are like butter.
you know it’s a hard workout when they mention “Mike Tyson “in it
Please tell me they “ain’t do” 150 reps of all that at one time!!!! 😮😮😮😮😮😮 damnnnnnn🤦🏽‍♀️
Im Bigger than them all and have never done a single push up. Waist of time
Love the work gloves. Pure dedication. Get it done. No not for fancy equipment
Why mike Tyson Just curious does anybody know?

Ironically this helped my pike pushups immensely. I have hyper mobile shoulders so I gotta have a strong base if I don't wanna toy soldier my stuff into the ER.

When the lecture is pushups, everything is easier than "bring sally"

We as real Americans don’t want physical success only we want real men they succeed >mentally, morally, and financially. boys need to stop chasing women …start chasing excellence.
I'll try this but I'll throw in squats and lunges to build up the legs too
Hell yeah brethren

Was whole this counts as 1 push up? If yes,then it's super crazy to do this 150 times😢
He needs to do more than 1 squat at the end fasho
Which penitentiary is this?
This should be a part of each city's districtwide societal norms.
My lower back hurts just watching this.
Good lord above!!! AMAZING!

Does this also grow muscle?
10 pushups to 1 squat ratio sounds about right 🤣
The dexterity of the last one on the right made me rolling 🤣🤣🤣
i like how they do some sports in prison to stay fit
Adjusting elbow direction and it’s a good workout
They are preparing for what is about to come.
That 110 lb guy made it look easy 😂

Loving this
My hands are on fire while doing this Extraordinary exercise 😮😮😮😮😅
What prison is this?
This isn't easy to do at all.
5x30
That’s very hard 😮
I can smell the grass in this video. All too familiar.
I can do 72 proper form push-ups. I can only do like 5 of these straight lol. I’m 200 pounds as well.
What jail is this??😮
10 sets of these for one is equivalent to a 2 hour work out😂
Why is there a ninja ?
“We got motion baby boy” 😂😂😂
Wow, unbelievable push up
dark knight's army level of training, man
They're training their employees hard at Xfinity!
They getting the milk
Imagine them trying to make us slaves again.. trippin trippin 😂
Brutal 😂
Does this exercise help anything?
he makes it look very easy, but that routine is a killer
I'll never here for this weekly
The army is desperate for new hires
Brotherhood fuck yeah! 🤜💥🤛✊️💯....
Let's look for money guys
this is insane for the chest ty
I spot a few cheaters there
See how hes not calling you weak, pathetic, have you cry lol.... just put in the work. I love this
I don't think I can get through one rep hahaha
2 of those and I'd be legit dead
Would this be considered a burpee
Rutina no apta para blancos
This vid motivated me 👍
Thats 1 rep
Good one
Im hurtin just watching. 😬
Bro is raising an army and monkeys for his team 😂😂
I was looking for a workout, not a demonstration on how you like to get shagged.
Bro your circle so good 😮
Ninjas in county
Gotta love squatting with nude men to feel more masculine
That looks hard :O This is my new personal fitness goal. I'll be happy if I can do ten of the without dying.
Wonder if it would make it more of a challange if the push-ups were different types. The total is 10 push-ups alone with all the additional stuff. I think it would be fun to make the push-ups different every 10 reps. So first 10 reps will be normal push-ups. Second 10 will be diamond push-ups, third ten can be knuckle push-ups. And so on
You know you can just do normal compound exercises and diet right. This is really for clout
The problem with this is that it's too difficult to remember, at least for someone dumb like me.
👍🏽👍🏽
That is against some sort of war convention surely. Red flag......excessive training Intensity......potential badassery exceeds allowed maximums.
Bro ain't nobody doing all that
What hurts the most.
Working in the fields
This is one rep. Are you kidding me?
Push up 💪✅️
The difference between me and these guys....they're all in great shape already!  LOL.  I tried this and couldn't get anywhere near 150.
Stupid
Dude has no mass or I’m I thinking Ill logically
I like how you can state a fact an her 1000’s of likes
man I just started trying these, they gas me out so much quicker than regular pushups
An older homie had me do something similar to these with him. 13 push-ups in one rep. I was dying in between reps trying to catch my breath. That foo was beast mode
See how there different colored people take notes racist
Very true.
this some good work   i’ve done similar before   yes you do feel it…and real quick
In the back side need to be shown where they hands should be and wat they elbow should look like when they go down 😊
I do push up modt of the days and this is really hard. Thanks for the video. Saludos desde Puerto Rico.
he did it with such easy, plus talking
I do. Good exercise 💪🥱
It's easy for me
آماده کردن ابزار کشاورزی قبل از شروع فصل کشت

Man that’s 1500 pushups 🫠. I’m gonna try as many as I can tho

Don't think I would be able to do 1 whole rotation
Pushdown 😂
Bro this shit is hard I tried it till failure I could only do 9 reps of these in a row
Was he said "Mike Taison"?
Just tried it, and the Hardest one for me was the "swing toe touch" before the mike tyson, because i wasn't flexible enough to reach my foot from my pushup position.  And on the crawl out at the beginning I had to go on my fingertips until halfway out because, again, my lack of mobility/flexibility.
if i had an army. those are the soldiers i want
wait does one of these equal one rep or 10 reps? cuz if then doing 15 of this is not impossible
its too darkness...
Ouch bruh 😢
wouldnt it be pushup touch your foot instead of feet? since he  touches one foot at a time? by the way I just did 50 reps and it was better than use these equipaments from gym
I did this and it burns I will keep doing this till I can do it perfectly I will update yall everyday   Day 1: far from perfect  Day 2: a little better
Preço?

Que hace un blanco ahí??
Did three sets of 5 reps yesterday. Definitely feeling the after effects today💪🏼
Remarkable💚💚💚...
I thought for sure that was gonna end with either a vertical jump or a jumping jack.
These exercises make you strong. I did one with ultimate pushups and I learned quick they aren't easy but practice will make anything look easy
ew
I can feel the heat and smell coming off that grass
Damn, I tried and did two reps. Maybe I can do three reps on a good day lol
Next day after this routine first time, I couldn't get up well in the morning. My belly and back were out of my control. kkk

People with their shirts on are the only humble folks here. If you feel like you gotta show the world your progress, you’re foolishly mistaken. Progress is personal, not public.

Did 10 reps of this just to try and my ass cheeks got more burn than everything else. Maybe I should have more leg days.

African Genetics Superior No Other Race can go toe to toe with us and that’s a FACT!! Big FACTS!! Niggas can’t hang w us!! We Unstoppable this why they wanna keep us down this much!! If Black People and Africa Reached its True Height of its Potential. Africa Would and WILL 10000% Control the World. Richest Continent on Earth, Most Populous Strongest Army Worldwide, Most Resources, Nukes, ETC Africa would be unstoppable if it wasn’t for Western Meddling always keeping their Foots on Africas Neck Siphoning all the Resources for themselves sucking it Dry and then sanctioning them, banning them from Western Institutions, Coup Detats installing Puppet Leaders who give away all the resources for free literally he just gets a small check for himself. And then After they stole their resources Thrown them into a Financial Hole. They TRAP Them ETERNALLY with those Super Super Immoral UNPAYABLE IMF World Bank Loans that Even America Couldn’t be Able to Pay off After a 1,000 Years. Just impossible so Evil and Inhumane tne amount of Intrest and the Loans they trap these people in. Truly sick sick Money Hungry Greedy J ews and the Western IMPERALISTIC Hegemony!! This shit will end and Africa will rule the World by 2050 stats already show this!! The world is moving too fast everything’s becoming Modern. You can’t keep your foot on their Necks Anymore and force them to be STUCK in the 1800s only for Uk America France to steal all their Resources. Literally France gets all their Uranium, Nukes, Gold Everything just from Mail Niger and the Sahel States alone. Not to Mention the other 14 Countries France FORCIBLY trapped into the Francophone Currency where the French came burned down all their villages towns institutions Centuries Centuries ago and told the neighboring countries and Villages. You see what happened to Ghana and those who refused us?? You will end up the same and I’m a worser Condition. It was a Straight up Brutal GENOCIDE Burned the country to the Literal GROUND when the Ghanian Chiefs said He’ll NO we won’t give you our resources all Nilly Willy and deposit our Gold and Assets into French banks wtf do we look like?? Then the French Came Back Burning Looting Killing Everything in Sight. Completely Annihilated West Africa. And the other small neighboring states had no choice but to cave in and sign the Treaty with France. Thereby France Locking them in a Lifelong Eternal Terrorist Terrorizing Blackmail FRAUD scandal where they literally say “Give us all your resources, Any Gold, Diamonds, Gold Or anything you have doesn’t belong to you it actually belongs to us. And matter of fact I’ll let you Split YOUR OWN Resources with me= France the Theif. Any Gold or Assets you find All 100% will be deposited into French Banks. Yeah you’ll “oWN” 45-50% of it….. while all that income sits in French banks and France Can Leverage it, Trade it, Loan it and make INTREST on it. And the funny thing is France is sooo Evil. They LOAN the Countries their OWN MONEY AND RESOURCES BACK WITH INTREST!! IMAGINE THAT!! THE CRUELTY EVIL EVIL CRIMINALITY AND CRUELTY OF THESE FRAUDS!! And then on TOP OF that Any Country that has tried to Retrive any of their Resources From French Banks, the UK, Germany, Etc Etc. their all DENIED and Said NO Too. Originally they told them it’s “ a bank account you can access your funds anytime you LIKE” that’s a LIE face took 100% of the Resources will NEVER give it back. Doesn’t allow them to use it, retrieve it, take it back. Or do anything with it. And they are TAXED For Literally Using the French Currency FRANCE TERRORIZED THEM into Taking FORCIBLY COERCED them at the End of a Barrel of a GUN!! Stole all their Resources, Uses it, literally steals and loots it, Trades it, makes INTREST on it, loans it out, and for example all that GOLD Etc Gold prices go up all the time. This is AFRICAN GOLD Mind you forcibly STOLEN and Deposited into French Banks. Do you know who Makes the Profit off those Gold Prices rising?? France they steal it ALL. And tne Gold itself if the country ever tries to ask for it back! Just imagine that!! The Sheer Audacity and Evilness of these People!! Front row seats I tell ya!! FRONT Row Seats in H.E.L.L MACRON!! Say Hi to your husband for Me Macron. Shoutout Candance Owen’s!! She truly speaks the Truth to Light!! Censorship MUST STOP!! The first Ammendment is clear!! And All Companies within the U.S should Abide by the U.S Constitution and Federal Law.

It’s the free world, not jail. Go to the gym and lift yall.
His gloves match the shoes of the guy next to him. That’s not why I like this tho c:
Finally we found the original one
im going to try to do this right now
i Boyght same gloves for work byt they have too much grip. So i started to use them on workouts )) but i cut the fingertips because i am not an idiot
I feel like instagram reels comments would destroy these people
why arent they employed?
отжимание это упражнение чтобы в домашних условиях подкачать грудь для телок, а это что он показал полная херня где вы делаете кучу бесполезных упражнений тем самым перегружая и изнашивая свою тело впустую.
And lastly, end up in a coma.
Mike Tyson looking around like “ when did I do that” 😂😂
Doing that for 150 is just sucide
They all made it look easy. I would’ve been trying to hide in the grass like a chipmunk until it was over 😐

Most definitely arms burning for sure
Definitely a prison push up!
Thats right diddy gang
really good combo right there. Good for coordination as well. You can also do this near a pull up bar and do jump pull up at the end.
❤❤❤❤❤
I can do that but half way through I died
Best exercise
Abs on 🔥 just by watching 😂
i can't do one push up, but now i am going to train to be able to do this
With how muscular all these guys in this community is this is the safest neighborhood ever.
Imagine walking by minding your business and see men out in the hot sun working out….you will find yourself with sun burn by the end of the day because you couldn’t stop staring ❤
I like this

Theres 300 lbs between all of these guys... pishups , pullups and body weight exercises benefit skinny guys... not that is bad but if ypur 6 fett and over 180 just go get size

Лучше бы на хлопковых полях делом занимались
Im done going to the gym
Y las dominadas k las barras les dan miedo viva la calistenia
Army of machines
I did one!!!! Ill see yall tomorrow 😴😴
Why are y'all so close to each other when CLEARLY from the camera angle, the yard is MUCH bigger? Y'all gone kicking each other and bumping into each other and some more shyt. *"Push up, kick his head, push up, bump his leg, push up, squat, fall backwards on him. That's one."* I'm weak. 😭 😂   Other than that, all jokes aside, love this rep/set. Tough to do, but the results will be amazing.
🙏🏾
Parecem formigas
Gotcha but imma skip the push up mike diddy
Solid upper body workout but i would highly recommend adding some extra leg workout to it. 10 different upper body movements but only 1 body squat for legs per rep is never going to provide any functional strength since all of your power is generated from heel to hip
That yard work bunch monsters ...get it Dawgs
También en casa se puede o en carceles😅
A bunch of Y.N.s
One squat.  That’ll help the legs keep up for sure!
How many pushups did he do?
Good money 😅
If only we had this many men show up for fathering and mentorship meetings
Sheeshhhhh 😢but 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💯💯💯💯
Un olor 😅😅

Looks fun! Going to try
I remember my 1st day black we had no choice
If u have no job, u have time to do this gym shit 😂😂😂
Пушка!! Огонек 🔥 Забрал себе на вооружение
Well, well. A dude I know started doing this and very quickly became a real nigga. Although he was born with white skin.
saving this... so i can remember how to do it.   hopefully i can do a single rep
Daaaaaang
Poushup Chachuffi
So many chicken legs.. what about the lower body routines 😕
I did 25 of these, with 2 breaks of 3 min, and 15 sec pause between sets...it was crazy intense...I want to be able to do this without the two breaks...
Lil guys with no mass love push ups and pull ups...

Don’t knew the dude saying baby boy. Unnecessary.

Bro is fuckn tripping 😒 if he thinks he's getting my fat lazy ass to do all this. As if toe touch and push up wasn't enough already.
I did these with 10kg weights, i only started lifting not very long ago, doing that with weights is intense
Shit I'm winded after just watching one rep -_-
That's a lot of testosterone and granting right there. The men are on heat🔥
Just tried a couple.. hell of a workout.. gonna make an attempt to do some everyday
I just subscribed because I love black boys without shirts.....❤
Great
Is this a prison?
Decent gentlemen
This trainer is very edit.  He is fit 💯
50 pushups and 1 squat. That's why you all got chicken legs lol...
This is the result of too much free time
I'm good fam
I remember the first one of these i attended i threw up...and then continued to do pull ups, environment in these is amazing 😂
Skinny guys exercise
1 set is a culmination of 10 push-ups 🔥
i am enjoying this interaction thoroughly ❤
Lord don’t let my coach see this video, amen 🙏
This is savage
Do these people have jobs?
All these dudes are in top shape!
Солнце светит негры пашут

Insane! Much respect!

The power of an “UHZ” while doing any workout or running is insane 😂
Why is it called Mike Tyson?
Jail push ups 😂
Just a bunch of rasins

I legit can’t do 5 push ups
Just did this... Shoulders cooked
The one in the orange was just doing what he want 😭
The hoods getting ready 💀☠️🔫

I'm not about to do all that smh people are so extra
Tobeys
Light work

@Jouletrix
The speaker was so smooth, I thought someone else was on a mike talking. I didn't realize until watching the second time that the guy doing the demonstration was actually talking.
How many or is it for a certain amount of time
I counted 10-11 pushups with ads(extra step) and we going to 150 so u gonna be doing this for a while
EuroTreino
He look like jr Smith not gonna lie 💀
Anaerobic pushups don't help with gains, but they are good for helping your joint strength. Time under tension helps with gains. So mix and match at your own pace.
C'est quoi ça😂😂😂

Just subscribed to this channel. I am grateful for this channel and the motivation that is being provided. This is my favorite push-up to do. And I recommend anyone to come to this channel and spread awareness and support. I recommend this pushup to a lot of people that I communicate with daily. It’s not easy at times but it’s worth it! 😎💯

It’s like even time men do push ups it seems easy but when woman do push ups it seems hard
Красавцы
I don’t understand the mike Tyson what makes that “Mike Tyson”
What is the benefit of this exercise?
النو داش کجایی

Never been so happy to watch a video ever

Definitely a prison workout. Every penitentiary in America does these workouts in the prison yard.
How can I join? I’m tired of being overweight
Man if he don't breath heavy for a quarter of a second I might lose my mind

Per reps 10 push up, 150 reps means 1500 push ups 🥶
He needs to keep his feet together when you do pushups
все так пашут на полях
Why would i take advice from a guy that looks like that
This is what i do when im on vacation,  and dont have access to iron plates.
Got them boys solving puzzles and working out
ㅇㄷ
There is something so unnerving about hearing a bunch of men grunting whilst sweating, with no shirts on. It reminds me of Rammstein's song Mann Gegen Mann. Watch it, you'll see what I mean 😂😂
I would rather do this than being on the street committing crimes or taking  drugs this is very positive ❤ it.
soljas
репчик зачитытывает😅
Gives new meaning to Beast Mode!😱🤯
Wait, can people really not do 8 pushups without dying?
God loves you
Where is this place?
Been single for a year and this was a special treat.
Prepararing them for prison thats all.
MUCH respect ✊🏾 for these brothas! We have to take care of the “temple” that is our bodies! I need to do better about taking care of myself and my health! ☮️
I see one white guy bro must feel lonely
Impressive people working to improve themselves
150? dear lord. I can do 25 regular ones and that's it.
just do regular push-ups they are making it fancy for the camera, this moves discourage most who are just getting started, basic push-ups and bicycle crunch gives better results, add chair dips and walk ,that's it, and 150 is actually too much it will hurt instead of gaining, do 3 sets of 30 each, rest between sets and do it 4 days a week to allow yourself time to recover,  don't be discouraged by these steroid users, it's not that complicated

Push up is way easy for skin ppl then ppl who has weight, no matter how much the work out frfr

The prison routine outside of prison lfgg
African body ❤
Is there an exercise you can do to, get a job, live a stable life, stop beating your wives, live in the same household and stop cheating on your women?
this routine is no joke. I tried it and it had me gasping
I am burning fat just by watching this.
gtta get to this 😮‍💨👌🏾
I swear we did this in BMT 😂
I miss them days...i just hate what got me there
His control makes it look doable. Then all the guys huffing and puffing and speed completing shows you how much strain. And it’s a rep. You do it once, then 9 more times. 😂😂😂
Ух какие красивые парни
Savages
Awesome 👌🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Never say the N word in front of them😂💀
Well its easy 4 him to do that routine.  He's light & skinny no muscle mass. Plus nobody really gonna rember all those steps. No time for that. U really want to improve in body muscularity. Run or sprint every 3 days & rest one day & lift weights the other 3 days in the gym.
This is hard work 💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
Nice video.How many set should i have to do?
I mean i did it once at least. In 1997.
🐦‍🔥
And here I am, struggling with just one push up.
Хорошо получается у них.👏👏👏

My fatass would have fell forward and ate grass
Dang!!
I ain't doing all that 1 squat that's it.  Dinner
I was doing 100 of these everyday and noticed quite a bit of change but when I switched it to 200 every other day (doing nothing the day between) my gains increased dramatically. I'm about to turn 55 so I guess my body needs that day in between to recuperate.
America needs such power on the fields
Bouncing turd army right there ma boy.
cha cha now ya'll
I severely underestimated these!
Nice! Slow down hustlers. If it's a race it is one the tortoise wins.

push up, touch your meat push up, touch your meat
Sorry but I was 120 pounds when I was 12 and stuff like this was easy merely because of bodyweight. Could 1 arm pull up too. It's almost like bodyweight exercises are easy when you weigh nothing.
Salshishon
I dont know if anyone in the comment section peeped the instructor but not only did he show them what to do, he did the exercise along side them and finished first before the vid cut off
And that’s one! 😂

You ain’t a tough guy
De verdad has estado tan sola? No lo digo por ofender, es que, donde yo vivo, es común que una chica casi nunca esté sola, y eso de lo qje hablas es incluso raro en chicos, pues en mi caso siento que en parte ha sido mi propia desición el estar sólo, la consecuencia de nunca sentirme cómodo con la mayoría de personas no por hacerme el especial si no porque literalmente siento una fuerte incomodidad y ganas de irme cuando estpy en un grupo cpn gente charlando, y al final creo que seguirá siebdo así, aún no soy tan mayor, pero lo suficiente como para darme cuenta que esa forma de ser ya permeó mi personalidad tanto que, al menos, creo que no podré volver a reinventarme.
Mike Tyson??? I Ain’t Neva Seen Mike Do Dat Before 😭

If I had known your videos soon enough, I would've taken up that Dick Grayson/Robin/Nightwing job! I created his Escrima/Kali batons a year ago. I love how everyone tried their best. But I am impressed that you had a lot of core strength to be able to BEND THE BAR LIKE THAT! Next time you go to Arkham in Year 2, I can't wait to see you upgrade the suit and bring the Bat Family again. Stay safe, Batsy. 👀
What bout P.Diddy move instead of mike Tyson 😂

Это куда готовятся эти афро? У них и так генетика сильная, плане мускулатуры. Я надеюсь они, это делают в свободное от работы время!
The comments are different on other apps ..
Thats mostly due to BMI, the less weight your carrying the easier that is. Bigger people have harder time doing it
Но хлопок не ростет так низко 😂
Thank you brothers, What else I can say, this is amazing
Надеюсь, это им поможет быстрее собирать бавовну!

Everything hurts to much. I got terrible R.A. In my spine and with no pain meds I’m just stuck in pain. Just getting by till i die or where i can find pain meds so i can live a normal healthy life.
It reminds me of boot camp, with the exception that everything has to be in unison
And did all that while talking
So at what point does the push up count as 1?
If is spent a year in prison I would probably extend my life my 10 years or so.
Cool
Crawl out... And I'm done
Push up.... straight to heaven💀
Exhausted just trying to follow the push up touch this, push up touch DAT!
A bunch of black men getting fit, with some Sazon and salt mixed in. YALL BETTA GET FIT ❤❤

This looks like something Mike Tyson did when he was in jail, he came out looking like a TANK. If this won’t Jack you out I don’t know what will.😂
Thought someone else was explaining while he did the exercise, didn’t realize he was talking while doing it until the comments! Damn impressive👏
They are bouncing, like if they are in a competition... You have to fell the excercise, do it slow as the first guy.
hell no😅
That too much work for just doing pushups fk that
Grandma, can you buy me one?
I felt tired watching this
How many reps should we do of those?
Looks intense... but you're already in shape.
That's a nice penitentiary
unvollendete Affen
Damn looks killer I need to try

Push up , kiss ur balls
WHY DO THEY LOOK LIKE FOGS AT THE LAST
My fatass cant even do 1 pushup💀
All that for what? It’s useless
These gentlemen are powerful. Well done, men.
Did i just have deja vu?
Brutal!
The dude in the middle is the only one doing a real pushup and workout, lol. Going slow, in control, fully extending to get the stretch, perfect execution, and technique in his pushups. He will gain the most forsure. That's why he already looks the best
I am in my 40s mother of two,  and I am going to try this and see if it works
💪💪💪
Сборище дрищей. Вы не готовы все.
U lost me at touch my knee
Mike Tyson didnt make sense

Pushup touch your balls

The hard thing is he’s talking
This workout is a killer definitely got to have your stamina and endurance up
Should do more squats, a$$ to grass!
I did this routine and now I cant get up
Fire, I love it

Eso serían ejercicios pliometricos?? Y para qué serviría en general
Posso farlo anche se sono caucasico? O rischio che mi spari la polizia?
This reminds me of the army. Everything is push ups and pull ups with some random task thrown in.
Man. On. 🔥 Literally 😮😮😮
Whole lotta nonsense
The first time the team had played a match was against a top side in a game that had a lot to lose and a team e an j t a lot of e a lot to be e you are so in e

All that waste of good energy just do regular push ups
Lemme leave this comment here I'll use this when I start working out
danm
Why can’t I just do this everyday?! It’s free!!
I am about to start doing this but I am going to change it up to add more reps, push up touch the elbows, push up touch shoulders, push up touch chest, push up touch the knee, and from there it's the same, but I am going to try to do 10 reps
Выпустите этих парней на хлопковые поля! Им энергию девать некуда!

🔥💯🫡💪
The devil is a liar.....yeah yeah yeah yeah!
Just do burpees
Did these for the first time today. Air squats upset my knees. So I did high jumps instead. Loved it.
we did this in my karate class, but minus the things while standing up and minus the mike tyson!

i cant even plank for that long let alone all that
Hi

О Норм привезли рабочих на посадку картошки

So lets do thisssss , really!
Get back to work
Damn, I miss being young. I'm too old for all this now. I only practice sight alignment and sight picture. 😂

I had to do he push up and tap on shoulder 120 times in school one time and iw as the only one able to not fall out of my other 2 friends
Good thing this isn't instagram reels
These workout boot camp things are super gay not that there's anything wrong with that
All that is one rep???
We need it for pe at schools like juner high

If only this group had that kind of commitment to completing a high school diploma or a college degree. Or child support this inner city violence might slow down a bit
Push up touch ur meat 💀
Put that much effort into a job

The mike tyson should be called p.diddy

Didn't know a push up can be that dreadful. Lol. Good job. I gonna add this to my routine.
I have zero reps in me and I am not ashamed to admit it.  Protect yourself at all times even when doing routine exercises!😅
It s seems crazy to me that poeple don t consider weight in this. You can t imagine how much harder this is on bigger dudes
Pls show some fat person doing this.

I love this ❤
Ain't no baby boys in there sir

You guys are so awesome.
Omg I can only do this once going back down is diabolical
Show them legs tho
Idky but every time men are working out or play boxing anything honestly and they start making those sounds I be dead laughing. Not out of rudeness or anything it just sounds funny
"Ok now, 3 sets of 10😊"
Why not add a vertical jump to the squat…

Why gloves
Tufff
This man is a Superhero!!!!

Work outs are fire and everything, but the baby boy comment though 😮
Солнце еще не село  Работайте сникерсы 😂😂😂

What the point in using gloves
1 like = 1 rep (no cap)    Like only valid for 7 days. I'll upload the video on this channel, no cap, trust me.
Bro knows the routine and lean/lightweight so of course he’s the best. Them dudes will catch up..and that’s when he switches up on them again lol. That’s that yard work 💪
Muchísimas gracias
If you guys didn't anything watching this!! You are officially cooked
That's 1 rep 👁️‍🗨️

این کامنت فارسی چون خواستم به ایرانیا بگم که ای داره از بچه شیر ایرانی اسکی میره
Bro could’ve added at least 7 more steps, this is ez work.
I just want to know how they remember the whole routine lol
Damn... I wish
La investigación continúa y las pruebas científicas demuestran que el bebé fue estrangulado, además qué la fecha en que se suscitó la supuesta violación no coincide con el tiempo de fecundación. Si los menores de edad incurren en un delito, los padres deben pagar el tiempo de condena hasta que el menor cumpla la mayoría de edad y cumpla el resto de la condena que le pertenece. Así hay responsabilidad.
I wonder if this will become a trend in two months 🤔
What kind of gloves are those?
ONLY IN NYC
Broo this is the army black people is setting up for race and civil war in the us. Bro it's going down now

The background reminds me of something
O instrutor fez parecer fácil kkkkkkk
I cant even remember all that
Wicked, but the best is if everyone did together in unison, no cheating. This will create a good rhythm and a good feeling by all. Else ego will soon show its ugly head and a lot of willy waving comes naturally afterwards   Love it tho. Big up👊🏿🙏🏿
Бибизяны готовятся к деревьям! Бибизяны крутые!
One set or how many?
What a spd exercises. Just press the barbell few times, it's completely overpowered this ostentatious push ups. People eat this, because they don't know.
I have integrated dumbells and an overhead press into this. Its fantastic. Also why is that one move called "mike tyson?"
Doing this is burning the shoulders 🔥 stay hard 🔥

Когда сверху летят бомбы или гранаты с квадрокоптеров - это не поможет. Это чисто для себя и пугать слабых. А любой ганстер с пистолетом решит эту «проблему» за пару секунд. Для чего себя так мучать?
Is this St Quentin?
And then push up touch your meat 🥓
best routine I've found by far thanks for putting this out there
Can't teach you how to tie your - Mike Tyson - shoelaces though

Excuse me, but while it may be an effective workout, the lack of proper form during the exercise raises concerns about the potential for injuries. The risk of sustaining an injury is significantly higher compared to using proper form.

I'm gonna report you for having a phone in prison

Next time u say *baby boy* you will plant a black seed. I see  so much chocolate.. either you fight them or you become a master of the words...  Ur tongue cant slip up.. .. feed their ego or have a united  motive..  that one word.. changed 3 -4 niqqa's posture.. xD one of them damn near flinched mid pushup
Is this considered a HIIT workout?
Audio sounds like a Diddy party💀

I died watching this 😂 my chest hurts 😂
All you need
💪🏾
Some of these are in my yoga & paletes class !!! If i could do a push up i would that too! ❤❤❤
No women on comments, where are they? 😅
This is very good. Add some inverted rows, chin ups, deck squats with push presses, reverse lunges with twist to standing knees-to-elbow, or sprinter's lunges, marching bridges, upward planks, & side planks and you've got the complete package.
Did 15 min ago...i can confirm its tough. Chest and triceps are dead now
African people❤❤💪🏿
No leg having ass niggas. Sike naa good workout but better be doing some lower body
fire

That's that work
I’ve been doing this for a couple years and results are phenomenal! Check my channel for more fitness tips!
3 sets done l like it. But next time not after 3 apple pies. Be doing this on cardio days thank you 🙏🏾

Never listen to a FAN BOY THATS CANT TIE HIS SHOES CAUSE IT LOOKS COOL 🤡
Unnecessary!!!!!
Not too hard it would be hard to do fast did this in boots and dress clothes😅
Mike Tyson?
Mike Tyson is crazy
Anyone who says it's easy i tried it, average reps? 0.5, literally half of it, best amount of reos? 2. 2 reps was my best, it is painfully hard! Hurts everywhere in the upperbody, if some random ahh kid says its easy, they just doing it wrong, I've seen my friends do pushups and it looks so goofy,almost as if they are trying to back shot the ground💀  I'm the only one in the friend group or shall say entire classes only person who can do a real pushup, personal best pushups was 7, I made it easier by adding angle, like a wall lean, lean against a wall or use a chair to have much angle but less, which makes it far easier but still hard...
And you gottah tell “Euro” after every right touch and “Training” after every left touch. 😂 Those who laughed at the reference watched good comedy growing up
One full set will tear me up. This is insane.
GET MONEY!!!
Push up. Swiing! Lol
Tough 🫡🔥🔥
👏🏽

There at the end. " Days never ending, massa got me working, one day massa set me free!"
Simon says.
Great fit for marines
Next: push up, twerk
Real talk. All we did in basic was pushups, situps, and running. It gave me the best body I've ever had.
He made it look so easy like it wasnt even a workout.  As if he was getting a cup of tea xD
Fuck man I need to get with the program! This workout looks like it’s gonna be a killer! Thank you for the motivation to do something!
On my 3rd day doing em. I do 5 sets and 50 pushups after. Shoulders be💀
That mike tyson looks more like meek mill…
Peugeot... peugeot...
I love this!!! Definitely will be doing this soon!
Yeah but look how skinny he is of course is easy for him to do that when I was skinny like that I was able to do that like nothing
All that effort for 1 tenth the muscle growth of a bench press.  Never understood why people bother with push-ups of any kind, it’s not going to give you a big chest or arms, even if you do them weighted. 95% of calisthenics is just cardio. Not only that, but calisthenics are difficult to progress on, because you don’t use weight. They’re also very taxing.  The only calisthenic exercise worth a damn is pull-ups. Dips are much better than push-ups, but they still are trash compared to the bench. I could do weighed dips with 100lb x5 @200lbs bodyweight, and when I tested my bench, I could barely do 225lb for a single, and I was even doing overhead press as well. That’s when I realized that dips were completely worthless, and the incline bench was superior to the OHP.
He is speaking while doing this😮 I am so impressed. I wish I could push up
Man, I can’t do Mike Tyson step, weren’t blessed with genetics as you are
Damn!
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Push up, Mike Tyson...flat on face.

Me thinking im bout to start getting some work in again after not working out for years. 4th rep in and I remembered why the hell I stopped. Arms burning like bacon in the grease.
Now imagine if all the melanin men and women worked out physically and mentally and got firearms training
Why Mike Tyson had to do with all the push up?😅
Ian gone make it pass touching my knee boss
Push santini push santifi😂
Thought I heard Diddy say; "we got lotion, baby boy"😂

@supersmithadventures
Damn this is how boys become men!
So 15 of these to make 150 push ups? I love it because it helps you reach 150 push ups while working other muscles.makes a good 30 minute work out. 15 when you master it like he has.
Way too many moves !!!
I’m On it !  Need those  muscles in my Life !
Y they got gloves on

Mike Tyson once said: man have to have a heart. You guys have it, proud of you.

😥😥😥😥😥😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Where did the 150 push-ups come from🤨
Is this a prison???
I done forgot  what to do after the second push up......definitely will be looking or listening for the next move.
Look like some P Diddy ish
Aaah, those special men clubs...never was into that homoerotic stuff
Total waste of time! That doesn't confuse muscles, but tires them faster! If you want to get STRONG, you have to do INDIVIDUAL workouts, for EACH muscle, this is CHEATING yourself
anying shoulder tap
There all black except like 2 how we supposed to do this without those genetics
Do the hokey pokey and then turn yourself all around
Bros 90 pounds

Somehow this popped 🆙 Now I gotta try 🤞🏽💪🏽✅❤️
I can’t remember all that
Straight up
White people can't stay out in the sun for that long. We will burn.
Saw this like 15x in a row. Need to work up to this for certain. This is very Powerful 🫡🚨💎
Thats intense 😮
You could just leave out saying push up
Damnnnnn, he does that with absolute ease!!!
this looks hard imma try it later
Yall to racist to let a white man join or is the group diverse enough 😂😂😂
Ok I’m on it💪🏾💪🏾
Bro said "HASSUHH"
This would break me 😂😂😂
Will I be the only girl in this group? Ready and waiting.Wendy Carrey🥷🥷🇨🇦
Was that 1 rep? Serious question.
Whats one squat gonna do lol
Where yall at I’ll run out there
How would that change my life? It's pretty obvious you already have to be as fit - and fit in a specific way - as these dudes to do this routine in the first place. If you try doing this without prior conditioning you'll burn out mid-session. If you don't, you didn't need to do it in the first place. :3
The community of Men working together without harm in unity is just a beautiful thing! I See Y'all! 🤍
Commenting for later to try at home. I wanna be strong so baddd
My dream is to do 10 perfect pushups like this.
Instruction dude sounds like kendrick lamar
"Push up, Mike Tyson in prison"

Prison workout 😂
All you need is a plantation and a whip
I already know their shoulders were begging for mercy probably by the second or third set, lol you def have to work up to that
These ain’t “burpies” these are UNCONTROLLABLE VOMITING.
😮
You make it look so easy and seamless. I cant even do a proper wall push up.
I almost landed in an ICU just half way of doing what bro did!😂😂😂 Brozy is in another level entirely! Voicing, instructing and doing the work is just straight outta planet earth. Well done muscle man, I appreciate you.💪💪🙏
Folsom?
That crawl up and squat is the most important part! If you do all that and don't finish properly, you're going to hurt something.
this is brutal.
Oh please send this to the Commandant of the Marine Corps.  Some my young bros need some mo' tightening up .
his voice is smmother than justin
Full body right there, I consider myself fit and TBH will struggle to do five of these.
Sh!!t I'm sore just watching that😳
Push-up blow your nose, push up scratch you butt, push-up lick your lips, push-up file your taxes.
3 sets and I'd die
Super 💪🏾
I have to try this.
There is an imposter among them
Ahã. Oh yeah! Ahã. Oh yeah! Ahã. Quantas ele deve ter feito p ficar só no ahã hein? 😂

Love this
10 push ups per set. Wild 😮
Although... I have experienced an inguinal and additional abdominal hernia due to excess exercise/stress after delivering my first child.i appreciate the effort but also know other factors determine success..
I'm 41, 6'1", 307lbs, I tried to do 5 of these in a row, my form fell to shit at the end of the 3rd one, so 5 in a row is the goal, gamechanger pushup for sure
People think thats it .. and its over...than u read ..do 150 of these in discription.
People think thats it .. and its over...than u read ..do 150 of these in discription

Dang that's intense!
Sound like spongebob when he taught squidward how to blow a bubble
So like 10 pushups with extra stuff. Not bad I guess. How many sets of those in a row? Or rest between?
Cardio, stamina a little bit, body balance, and simultaneous actions😊

What prison is this?
"PUSHUP swing toe touch PUSHUP swing toe touch PUSHUP Mike Tythson"

That guy weighs like 140 pounds at the most. A push up is nothing to him.
اینا میخوان بچه شیر بازی دربیارن ولی تو رکورد زدن میلیون ها شنای بچه شیر کم میارن
People are weird. Who throws so many Snickers on the grass. What a waste.
Amazing..the kind of stuff I like
Хорошо так лихо отжиматься, когда весишь 40кг как этот малыш учитель😂
Before you realise, you’re on 10! Just keep breathing and the power is within you
Brilliant
👍🏿 The routine concerning this complex, particular push-up seems aggressive in its aim to strengthen multiple muscles, simultaneously. Nevertheless, it's motivational. Two Thumbs Up! 👍🏿
How much for 3 of them? They are good pickers from the training you do!
when I win the 5B dollar lottery all my slaves getting paid 50 dollars an hour if they train like this
Wouldn't be better doing that with a girl under..??
How many can a person reasonably do?
Want to join them but I’m not in prison
Ty shih
I’m a female and I’m on a mission lol
I might have to start this regement😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Is this a workout club? Or can anyone join and workout?
Wow
Gayest video of the day.
Look at all those badass looking men! I would love to see some stupid feminist in the comment saying woman are equally strong 😂
Sportacus moment

Dumbest shit ever ...
This is extremely intense I could barely do one set
Почему так много черных в последнее время

Ok, so I just broke crawling out! Help 😂😂😂
Look at those bodies!!! 😅😮😊🎉
😊
Cool exercise, just don't get it twisted. You either train strenght or endurance. Aerobic and non-aerobic exercises are mutually exclusive
Mike Tyson twerks
Is that 1?
All that just to be as skinny as Cristiano Ronaldo.
This looks like FUN!!☺️    #noseriously
Screw that!! Yall look like slaves man, screw all that noise.
How many times?

Monkey in a shiesty mask like it increases his strength or endurance lmao
"Chaos" Work!✊🏿
I would be cooked by the first push up 💀
Why wasn’t I invited ?

Good thing this wasn't on Instagram 🙏
I just got my workout in! I’m doing this tomorrow tho! How many ladies going me! We can at least try! 😅
Perfect exercises for prison break
step 1 remember
First motion I'll be done!
this looks like a fantastic exercise, when I get my mobility and strength back Im definitely going to be doing this routine.
I hate to say but they need to improve their form a bit
Your just doing cardio at that point cunt 💀
Do you go until failure or something? Or what's the # goal cuz i kinda wanna try this
Their memories are the most impressive
Ill do 50 at most. Subtract that 100
Not one deep pushup in the group.
Damn bro' just took back to jail!😢
You have to be super duper yag to use gloves to do that.
If everyone who eats a burger with fries and a Diet Coke go through this “ punishment “ after they eat the burger I bet they will go next meal for a 🥗 😅
Holy shit that's hard
Prison bs ahh workout
No matter what routine you do, your body will get used to it and you'll have to upgrade for more growth and development, so it don't end there, great job though!
Press up pros were luminous gloves
wow...
Ok, I'm saving this and doing it after my jog tomorrow.

My son wouldn't do it to save his life. Quitted all sports activities due to that😂😂😂. Great bodies frames from that!!!
Damn, you gotta be in hella good shape to even try and get in shape
Mike Tyson : "I dont want you to push me up"
Looks like a lot of guys trying to F### themselves.   🫠🤔🤫🫣🤭
Women getting pregnant Just by Walking by😂😂
I say this with the utmost respect and admiration but thank god colt made all man equal 😂 I wouldn’t stand a chance against one of these brothers if they had two broken feet

This is the army I need to win World War 3 😂
Soldiers doing this at 4am on a Wednesday is what used to unalive me 🙄😂
I like Mike Tyson
This is good if youre looking for flexibility and athleticism and already at a low body fat percentage. This is not good for muscle building or fat loss. Im putting this here as someone who understands fitness, not as hate. Theres nothing wrong with doing this. Just want to make people aware that dont understand that this routine might not be for them and their goals.
I got out of breathe just by watching it
They in prison?
I fainted just by the idea of this😮😅
Look like Lion gang🦁
I tried this..... Didn't move on day 3.....
🔥🔥👍👍👍
Its easy to do when you are 40 kg …
What is wrong with his hair?
Am glad this is not in prison... I hope all of these men find purpose and meaning in their lives...
it's great seeing a community of bros just being bros
Jajajaja ¿Qué pedo con los guantes de la obra? Los maquilocos se pusieron las pilas
That's great money.  Solid conditioning. Love it.
Excessive 😂
Bro just casually doing all that without any exertion in his voice is wild.
I pray to GOD that my coach DOES NOT find this!!!
To remember all that & then do it is insane
and just like that a rap song was made 😂 push up touch your feet “
😂i wanna see outta shape people do this though lol.
Long as we trackin

зачетная тема 💪
...and that's count 1, do 100
Now, read a book.
Prerequisite for working at burger king.boy!
Hardest part of this is probably going to be remembering the whole sequence
Warrior training is just as mental as physical, maybe more so mental inside training over the true work where thought is gone. and you give all that you've trained and worked for.
Crazy as hell
bro hit that "HEAD, SHOULDERS, KNEES AND TOES KNEES AND TOES" ahh push-ups still pretty cool
This weirdly reminds me of burpees, but 100x worse 😭
🔥
WHO THE FUCK TOLD THIS GUY TO BE YELLING THAT DUMB SSS SHIT-I honestly don’t cane why these fools do but GTFOH
PUSH UP TOUCH A  J O B  APPLICATION FOR SHITS SAKE-DONT YALL FOOLS WORK??? And not for nothing YALL look like bozos-I stopped working out w a “crowd” when I got released from prison due to me maxiing out!! YALL probably claim the bloods or some other wack shit “gang gang”
blacktivities
Maybe a few less pushups and a few mlre algebra problems?
Bold of you to assume i can touch my feet
like this comment so it saves
Mighty Men
Mike Tyson okay
I would have felt my life changing after one rep.
I am a boxer and u know this is fucking killing working
Say Knee German but without the man

Gays
A good place to lose your girl 😆
Great job
I know what doing tonight. 👍😉
Nice
This is why you see so many black guys with a decent upper body and toothpicks for legs. All that pressing with one squat.
Yall getting ready for prison? Nahh jk! Nice workout cuhh
Ძალიან კარგი მაგალითი არის ახალგაზრდებისთვის

Imma try this every day for the rest of the year and see what happens🙏🏿🙏🏿😢🙃🙂🥳🥳🤯💃🏿
"Trey focus on his balls" We now know😂😂
They say men don’t spend enough time training legs, but that one squat was intense.
I've been doing that
Супер ❤❤❤❤

Сядем подкачаться?
Looks like a prison yard
He said Mike Tyson

Number 4 from left to right does 2 mike Tyson. Your working to hard. 😂
Ahmad workout n1

1 round is 10 push ups, so gotta do 15 reps of this set. Oof! I'm dead watching, but I'm gonna aim to be able to complete one round in one week. Some gimme a positive comment to come back to in a week. 😅
Forget to touch balls
Uncomfortable watch when they’re all on the grass
What you training for? Cringe Tiktok sports?
what jail is this
I’m confused. Is someone supposed to do 150 of these?
"push up" Mike Tyson... ??? what ?? ha haha ha "push up" Ethel Mertz. "push up" touch your feet..
There's almost a pause with the first guy..effortless
Mike Tyson?
"1 ..... ..... .... .... ... .. . 2 ....... ... .... .... ... .... .. .3" lol But yeah, seems like a good work out. Only back exercise lacking
PRISON BOYS
Soo complicated
We did this in the joint and then lifted weights after the warm-up. 💯💪
Mike tyson? 😂
That’s a full body workout
💰💰💰💰💰💰
А могли бы приносить пользу на плантации...
Just watch the body of the guy is teaching it. Spaghestenics.
Jail routine smh smh.
How do they survive this?
How many reps y’ll doin?
The one squat at the end seals in the gains
I just did one set of these. I might have to throw these in for my chest day burnouts instead of just doing pushups till failure. What a fun workout dude
❤
First step: remember
My hubby told me to incorporate this in my exercise routine, no joke…🥴🥴🥴🥴
This looks like a great workout, I’m going to start on this very soon
Maaan how my fat ass gon do it😮
Prison work out
This is how we work ouy in the feds we call them burpees pushups mixing multiple forms in one set

They just work out at the  jim omg no body  can't do that 😢😩😩😩😩
Good job
This is really hard but I’m goin to master it💪🏾💯

Whatever we do wherever we go the pale ppl copy and follow them eventually monetize off of it
prison?
You can't watch all of them people doing that push up touching body routine some will be cheating 😂
Money
The penitentiary is a lot more fun these days
All for show, theres no real benefit from this other than bragging rights.

He didn't create this workout. Inmates did
I probably got about five in me 😭😭😭😮‍💨😮‍💨
Endurance yes but strength? I think not
This has to be the most silliest workout I ever saw from grown men I could see if he did more reps at least but bruh come on now this baby reps fr 🤦🏽‍♂️
🚮
they let you film in prison?
Nc
One of the best to built up your nervous system...if you don't QUIT.
Working out everyday isnt an easy habit to implement but once you see results on your mind and body you cant imagine stopping
I love it good workout
banana Kong

Swing toe touch.... THERE'S NOTHING LEFT!! Push up Mike Tyson... THAT'S ENOUGH! Squat... Throw the phone. 🚶🏾‍♀️‍➡️😂😂
Hold on... 150 of them, in one set?!

Day 4829 in prison
The squat would’ve taken me to my grave 🤣
Note: don’t do this if you have weak shoulders.
Mike tison😂😂😂
This is an amazing workout . Did 1 set and my body was burning already
Straight motivation 💪

I did not know that there was a school where they teach you how to not do a push-up I'm still waiting for one person to complete one push-up in this entire video not one single person's chest touched the ground
My shoulders are so crunchy  I can't do 1 pushup
How can they remember all That?
F me. I'd get bout half way and start dying.  Time to start dying and coming back to life.
When you weigh 10lbs shits easy
Peace!Not on your own strength but the strength of God in Jesus Christ mighty name and in His Holy blood please amen.God Bless💪🙏P.s.John 10:10 and Acts 16:31 please amen.Maranatha!Best wishes a former boxer 🥊✝️

You should of sang the head shoulder knees and toes song while doing it 😂😂😂😂
Buncha soldiers
The testosterone in this video 😅
He forgot the "push up. Touch your nose". That's the lynchpin that holds the entire thing together.
What prison is this?
Niggas do this in jail all day I thought it was a jail/prison workout  u be sore the next day if u never worked out those muscles lmfao
We did this in football practice years ago for warm ups, felt great I still do it to this day.
Just forwarded the video to my son and my nephews. Outstanding workout.
Somebody please tell me this is a football camp where they make men from the ground up!
Now damn!!!! This push-up exercise is called:   "Failure is not an option"   and it is brought to you by:    "the grim Reaper" a. K. a "Death-izzy"
Wow!!!
Seal training would make them start over until they get synchronized
This is that real money 💰 I use to do these jawns back in the day when I was up State on fake drug charges you have to do something to get a way from stressing,great work out 🏋️‍♀️ brothas…

How many f’ed it up 😆
1
Well well well
Tks 💪
@rampagesang
My only comment on this is why the fuck would I exhaust myself with a painstakingly long, not fun and probably far from optimal routine when I can just lift weights or do weighted calisthenics ?
Crazy
Here asking myself what made this man come up with a routine like this... who is she?! 😂😂
💪💪💪💪💪
Push up blue 42  Push up ur mom is blue  Push up hut hut  Push up hike 😊
Is one round a set cuz I’m probably not in that great a shape to last 5 sets but I could probably do 3sets
These foos weight 120 wet.  Doing bodywork don't do nothing when your light is a feather and not even hard foos.   Yall lame
Gaye
Bro said 150
🥴 observando me dieron calambres  🎉😅
Guy wrote a whole story in a push up
Elite slave training
Touch him
Thanks 10 sets is 100 push-ups and you feel so good after that and some jogging or running 🙌🏾
I guess there really is nothing but black people in jail #FreeTheGuys
yk what I m gonna do it rn
Bro gave then the prison version of euro-training.
sooo...whats his gloves called?
It's not going to help against a skilled opponent.
ัyou forget to touch your balls,
Well I only watched this and I am already exhausted and in pain in places I didn't even know I had.
You will feel every potato chip you ever even looked at after this.
Killer routine!
He looks Malnourished lol
Don't like sports without shirt, feel cold after sweat
Getting ready to go straight to prison who you kidding
LOOKS LIKE I WENT TO MY BACK YARD AND THERE ARE A BUNCH OF LISARDS DOING PUSH UPS
10:1 push up to squat ratio seems like a balanced exercise :')
How many times do it😢
かっこいい
Great workout guys.

The seed of drake
The gridiron gang

Great way to build confidence, discipline and a sense of accomplishment. Translates well to real life.

Gotta love those workouts where you need to already be shredded like a greek god in order to do.😂
stupid monkeys
I see good results...Trump24
Man spread tf out 😂
Lol
Now that's a lot of variation in just one move
Love it 💪🏽 team building workouts
Солнце светит, негры пашут)
Why do it this way? Seems like you are just going to fatigue yourself way faster than the muscles can get a good stimulus. Just use some plates to elevate your hands and milk the eccentric and a nice pause at the bottom to get a nice stretch.
No wonder legs are so skinny. Every squat they do like 6 push ups lol
Always gotta stay in shape to run from police ✊🏿🦧🦍🐒
I love this!! Motivation for me
4 sets of these in a row is burning 🔥
일단 푸쉬업까지는 성공했습니다

90% of them are using momentum or just have their butt in the air but I love to see people working out
There is a reason why they got rid of mountain climbers and 12 count push ups. Shit destroys you
Why am i seeing a yoga routine? 🤭
Is that a jail yard
Уже звучит как реп
When they all started working out together. Prison yard flashbacks 😂
Jobless
I’m starting this tomorrow!! Thank you.

That's 9. Let's see you that 150 times! That'll be good money for real 👀!
Prison workout
Who else try this later?
That ish is called Mike Tyson cause all Mike did was natural, non weight bearing calisthenics like push ups, dips, pull ups, sit ups.
Common now.   This is funnier than the Wayans
Follow your bliss and don't be afraid, and doors will open where you didn't know they were going to be.
Whe he doing Mike Tyson dirty like that ? 🤨
Let’s not glorify jail workouts.🙄
Id like to see james and rem do this together
Get that shit!!
Push up touch your foot.. not feet
The way I would have projectile vomited after 1 😂
My jacked up rotator cuffs hurt just watching this , respect ✊
Me watching this about to pass out. That is nothing but muscle failure. I’ve been through that in a military I’m good.😂😂😂😂
И так целый день

Gunna do start off doing 5 maybe 10 reps of this on my workout 🔥✍️🏾
Thr last squat seems.... unnecessary 😂😂
-Do you skip leg day?  -No, we only have pushup days
Then stand up nd have the audacity to tell me that’s one push up 😂
이거 개빡씸
AND HE'S SPINNIN!
The first guys voice is sexy.❤😂
I just wanted to say i was going to work out...not get into all this...naah.
@thatsgoodmoney show me a perfect pushup. If you do one perfect, i’ll follow, if you can’t do one i’ll teach you how to.
monkey?
My triceps sore just watching this
Is that a prison ? You really want the prisonners to be in better physical condition when they are free ?
push up mike Tyson?

Prison yard???
its AMAZING what people are willing to do when you put a camera on them! Shut the cameras & social off & not so much

Burpees schmurpees
Vous êtes des monstres

Kings !!
Working out like you’re still in prison
Look like the Army of 300 would do some shit like this😂
Bad routine for a group - keep it simple so you can all be in time more easily.
That for???
انسان عبقري وعالم الدين الوحيد في عصرنا الذي يفهم ويدرس القرأن
Do to holds bottom mid full extention, or decline feet flat on wall or full chest workout, tri, 5 sets 20s every station, shoulder width, wides, back to shoulder width make sure hands under nipples every time, hands 90 degrees, then 45 degrees, then do it all over again, 1000 push ups slower and full extention the better.
MT part wtf
It's mean but it's cardio made for small guys
鍾意。
Imagine gangbangers started doing this in the streets instead of gangbanging :D

Bro made an insane push cardio drill that's nuts
Push up  Mike tyson
yeah imma get a heart attack doing this lmao
I just do regular push-ups and sit ups and squats like one punch man
What prison is this?
Too many push up, you’ll also need to do back bridge push up to counteract the negative effects of excessive push ups, stiff shoulders and back. Fitness isn’t only about putting on muscles, it’s also about balance, mobility, flexibility. Regular push up only works one side of the body, the back bridge is neglected
😂🎉😂yeah id rather not.....skinny AF
Push up.....test E....push up....Dbol.....push up....Tren....push up.....Deca....push up....test P....push up....test C.....push up..  ptc ptc ptc ptc
When you thought burpees were rough.

Maybe when i turn to spaghettis flexibility, i can perform this routine.
Danggggg❤
Tuff 💪
Harder, read a book
Repent from your sins  and turn to Jesus, Jesus love us so much that he died for us so we could be forgiven he broke the barrier between us and God.
It's hard...but I'll keep doing it
that single squat at the end lol. i’d do at least 5 squats before my next rep. cant skip leg day
I can do this while sleeping. These jacked men can definitely do more
I got tired just watching the video😂😂

Bet.  I'm doing these.
I am going to take this as a challenge and  starting today..usual pushups I am getting bored..this is good💀
Im trying to do a total of 5 today at the gym. Wish me luck 😂
Narrated by  kendrick lamar
This s*** should scare every man into working out!! Because it's men out there that's able to do these by sets!!! And I'm sure 90% of the people reading this comment can't even get through one!!!  Now if that doesn't scare you (that you're a man and its a slew of them that can do it without breaking a sweat) shiiiiid got me doing them mfs RN!!!😂😂
These are the kind of folks I'd love to link up with after work each day. Sadly it's just me
Head shoulders knees and toes knees and toes
Some sexy men bout to come from this workout
Я могу два раза отжаться и Полежать😅
Now enjoy taking pills for your wrist pains after your 50’s 😂

I forgot this wasn’t insta
you guys stare at half naked men all day....
Im not smart enought to follow this routine
Man was talking the whole time like he wasn't doing nothing 😂
Just seem to unnecessary to get in shape. Joseph didn't do this. Most people got in shape from working
Mike tyson ☠️
Any good routines for a looting run?
Started with tha crawl down, then pulled a blanket on me since I just ate a family sized pizza called "Noah's Ark". Got my protein for today, probably the sodium too and I'm sweating so no need to do any TikTok excersises.
But they gots chickeeenleggsss 😅

All that just to get to one squat
They're all like 5 foot 2 120 lbs lmao
Fazer isso todos dias meu irmão é isso?

Climb up the mountain in fours, and go down the mountain in fours.....
Работать не надо сидят на пособие,и бездельничают!
It's daytime and nobody is at work😅
dont chase reps, that a cry for help, chase time under tension! Learn from good folks!
How many “crawl outs” though? Looks like you’re supposed to keep going for a distance or an amount to get to 150.
💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Now let's see them do some math problems, write an essay and then build a birdhouse.
"We gat motion baby boy!"...Denzel is that you?
Pusap chachi piiii 😂
Push up Mike Tysons😂😂
So is that all one rep?
Black people are already the strongest people in the world, they have the most developed muscles by nature. And when they also do physical exercises, they become even stronger.
идите работать!
Prisons these days ..
Ламбада
The one dude's head almost went up the other guys ass. It would have been a Handcock moment.
I literally just tried to do one and almost died 😮😂
Omg 😳
I'll be lucky to do a regular push-up
Ima walk up to this meet and start the most shiit
baki hanma kinda shit.Hyperbolic timechamber kinda shit
Looks a really good routine,  I'm certain after the 2nd push up I'll forget the routine  cause bad memory then my bad knees, my bad lower back, then my rotator cuffs.  Then I'll start yawning and fall asleep on the floor from working all my life and now I'm 46 and exhausted
I wish I could do with u guys . Well done
1 белый и 202000 ниг
Might give this a try. Wanna make my morning wake up work out a bit smoother
Man go daamn! "Wild" dont even mean what it used to anymore. This is that same shit that drove us to use negatives like "sick" and "bad" at the turn of the century to describe cool shit after the Ninja Turtles forced "radical" into retirement.  History repeats.
Man…much respect to all of you guys. I can’t even do one push-up, let alone all this.
"I can only do 10 pushups but allow me to demonstrate"
That is good
Push up:  pay your rent.  Push up:  File your taxes  Push up:  Open a high-yield savings account with Sofi (not sponsored)  Push up:  Invest in an index fund
How many reps and sets?
Man makes it look easy, but it's not at all easy.
Its kinda crazy how easy bro in the beginning made it look lol
Who’s gonna remember all that
Pushy
Prison workout
I'm a woman and I'm trying to do it, lol but I can't do it. 😅

I love this. Men being all they can be.
No touching balls?
Doing this today
Love this!
Never skip leg day.  I'd be interested to see, if they could combine this with an explosive leg work out.  I feel they'd struggle here.
Outstanding!
That BLAQ MAGIC is That BLAQ EXCELLENCE!!  👑💪🏾👑✊🏾👑🙏🏾👑🤲🏾👑👍🏾👑❤️

The gladiators

LOVE ✊🏿
This prison yard ass shit
Extreme
That's fit!
And I thought Navy SEAL and 6-Count Burpees were hard
I saw and added Mike Tyson. Not a bad idea though
Their breathing in toxic dirt
The example made me tired
Let me grab my chips and watch this again 😂 All BS aside, this ain’t easy…Even if you are in shape. 💪
In prison training?
Idk man, unless you're really leaning into the cardio aspect I don't see the advantage here over regular pushups. Especially SLOW pushups! Slow that shit down, get some hypertrophy going!
Fuck all that, I ain’t in prison anymore
Bruh wth kinda pomade y'all using for the hair tho! Soon as I walk outside my waves gone!
I'm impressed, very impressed. Way to take a push-up and incorporate in other muscles, balance and coordination. Bringing this back to the dojo. Excellent!
This is how leonidas trained 300 men
🫡💯‼️
Prisoners be doing all that and be like “1”
I was a Marine and that looks painful
Looks like a prison yard 😂
This is a weird version of head shoulders knees and toes, man.
I always respect these type a workout
huevones
Trying this taught me I have ZERO upper body strength. Give me a month!
All this is is cardio this isn’t building any muscle
That’s sick right there, but I’ll try
Getting ready to work the fields
Dont hear that your eyes close
They should call these the death push ups. Wueh so damn painful.
That's amazing. Now, imagine adding a jump at the end after the squat.
copyright your workout routine
Black Friday is coming  Ppl in USA:
Good money
I already forgot what I was suppose to do
Slavery evolved
Yeaa this is for those who are already in shape lol
This too much and this wild iffy looking 🤣😂

Many thanks for the inspiration 🙏🏿💪🏿
This is awesome!
dudes
I pray to the heavens to manifest this reality of strength and vitality in my body 🙏🏽🌅🌌🙏🏽
Bro, I just did some of these mann...why are we doing these again??
Love this, would you recomend this for someone thats almost 50 and has not workout in years with limited time.
I'd probably skip that "swing toe touch" just cause I don't like getting my head below my heart like that....but if you're only doing a few reps of this, probably doesn't matter.
Head, shoulder, knees and toes, knees and toes. 😂
@paulbarrtattoo
Prisoner push up😂😂
Subscribed immediately
i need community like this in my neighbourhood 😳
This looks like it will separate the boys from the men really quick
Beautiful
I am still in the standing position 😂watching everyone else
Id be dead after one i gotta step tf up, good shit
That random routine is based on zero science and facts and it is absolutely not the best way to increase push up strength
😳
What in the jail😂
Men growling like hungry pitbulls 😂💔
First time that i white guy stands out
what's the count and rep
Keep returning me back to this page
Bro has never hit leg day
Which prison is this?
Doing wayyyy too much - just do slow push-ups feeling the tension the whole time 🙄
A community in shape is quite the formidable force
Sexy!!!!
Let’s goooo. Love to see shit like this. Gonna make me drop down & try the routine once or twice. Need to get back into my push ups
When I was booked we always called Mike Tyson's the setups you stand up without anybody on your feet, lay back down dona sit up stand up lay down repeat
This guy is light as a feather!
Smh ......😂😂😂😂😂
Im tired just watching 😂😂
He makes it look easy
What's the benefits?
Jailhouse bullshit.
Mike tyson?(
Damn! I wanna be part of this
I’m so trying this out
I definitely would have to work up to that
Yoo, bros are 100% control our muscle 🔥, all guys do is so smooth💪
I only understood "Mike Tyson"
I like listening to this with my eyes closed
LOSE the gloves

Push up, touch you di....
This is stupid
I imagine this is what prison looks like.
That was the terry cruz one rep lmao😂
Wow, what a waste of time. xD I can do half this work out and still get the same results.
Monkey party
Ouch.
I just attempted this after randomly coming across this video on YouTube. This seriously sucks after multiple reps. I did almost one rep of all the exercises and stopped lol
Bro just tricked 15 men into twerking for him “mike tyson” my ahh😂😂
💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
I can do this and still wont get results
Pffffff😂
Never seen some more gayer shit in my life.....get some chicks there boys....ya looking like jack a$$3$
Bro I might die if I was to be trained around these folks they don’t joke around.💀
lost me at “crawl out”… can’t we do a different one??
Thank you I love seeing black men be well

Pizza salchichon?
thats just yoga with testosterone
Woah 🤩 this is kinda fun 😊
And the knee/ foot touch, work the abs/core too!!
They getting that WORK IN!!!! Respect 💯
Why dude wearing a mask working out? Tf man.
Gay
Yooo duly noted
Uffff gracias hay algunas cosas que todavía no he hecho 👍🏼
That's nothing, it's when the trainer asks you to do 10 reps that kilss.
Prison exercise
Idk why this feels like the real life version of when spongebob had anchorarms and was showing everyone his "routine" and they all started doing it immediately
Bruh lost me at crawl out 🥴
Is that 1? 😮
I cant do 10 proper straight push ups help😭🤲🏾
Is this jail prison workout
Oh hell yeah 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can i touch someone else's knee when i push up ?
Kuntakinte Nawakame!!!!
If you don't love nothing else, ya gotta love this!!!
Gonna try this
Calling another grown man baby boy...
1 rep is kinda tiring already damn
I wish this was ifunny. The things I would say LOL
this is legit... you will be in shape in no time
Training our warrior class❤❤❤
Never let a midget instruct you
requirements, have abs before trying this
New gold gym bruh
The one who demonstrate is freaking good
Some of them guys cheating 😂😂
They do white girls for cardio on BlackedRaw
who watching the green glove guy?
"..aaaand, that's 1"
daaaaum, brothas in jail have a good training time, 4 life
My Dad Had Me Do This During Summer Before Freshman Year Of Highschool. I'll Admit I Was A Bit Chunky So He Had Me Doing Cardio And These Types Of Pushups. Man It Sucked But I Was Skinny And Ripped First Day Of Freshman Year. Also Helped Because I Was 6'4 Now I'm 6'7 And Still Do This And Stay In Shape. It Sucks In The Beginning Stages But If You Keep It Up You're Body And Mentality To Keeo At It Will Keep You Straight
Jjk
From now on this is what i would do if i am out and can't go to the gym .
Everything is a good exercise if you just made it up and no one knows how to do it or is used to it. That guy has had so much practice before the video but you post it with the idea that is everyone’s first time. Anything that’s 150reps will build strength and endurance
Работать пока солнце высоко
Trust me when I say this isn’t doing shit for these athletes on any form of the imagination
Why not just hit shoulders at the gym
ماذا جاء حرامي لعندهم بالخطأ 😅😅😅😅
Thems is slightly worse then burpees. (I just really hate burpees)
Id forget the orddr instantly
Looking good Men 👌🏽 that's what's UP 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Dude in jail taught me these called them Aztecs
My shoulders started burning up by just watching this 😂
That’s hard work boy.
Not a bad YARD
You don’t have to do all this to get in shape . I train people everyday in Huntington Beach Ca and it’s easier more exciting effective ways to get in shape . Doing all this xtra stuff will definitely get you sore and hurt
How many times? Or until fail? Cause I got about five in me lol 🔥
How the heck can i remember all those steps
@teezybaby
How about training on how to fill out a job application
The yard
Sprinters will eat this...females or males
Im exhausted just watching
What jail is this?
Oh my God me tried it !! This Dude is savage for this one ☝️ !! I felt pickled and faint Dizzy but I made it 😂
Cardio , core strength  Everything
That’s wasn’t the Mike Tyson that was the “diddy”😂
Damn.

Building machines

I tried it and it didn't work out well
This is stupid
These brothers with the business hell yeah
Bruh I could not talk that calm whilst doing that 😂 I am unfit I need to change!!!
❤
All that and can't fight
Я прямо почувствовал как моя жопа напряглась 😅
Just died, family is going to sue.
We are good at working at nothing...jeff bezos. Bill gates. Obama. Jesse waters. Dr umar. Use brain power and get paid way more. Slaves use there body to make money. This ehy we play sports and then go broke
Crazy…let’s get to work
Mike in there
He talking while doing it like it's cake. What a beast!
Pero aique comer tan bien,no sean marros😂😂😂
How many sets tho? 🤔
U da man😊
I'm athleticly built. But I admit I'm out of shape severally. I did 2 sets of this and my Fitbit heart rate said 125bpm. I felt like death was just waiting in the wind forme to kill over. This routine is DIABOLICAL. But effective AF.
Pushaa salchichonn!!
That's why they got chicken legs
Hispanic dude in the back got a weird ass physique lmao. Looks like he has a 6 pack and chubby at the same time 😂
150 of what?! 😂😂 150 as totals reps or 150 sets
Работайте негры, солнце ещё высоко!! 😂
And this is just the warmup
Best intense workout to lose fat and gain strength 🔥
The fuck they think this is gratersfort?
Just found my new routine. 🔥

Towchasouda
Prison???😅
Y'all 😂 boy I need to join this group cuzz I'm fat as f

Nobody can do this everyday, tour joints will be pain and injury ,not sustainable
Yeah, but first straighten your knees, Tyrone.
Ima start doing that with my weight vest on 🦾🦾🦾
Which prison is that?
Calem os bocas de apito. Não faz o menor sentido ficar fazendo esses barulhos com a boca no treino.
He's not even a big guy just really flexible.
This dude is strong af. He’s doing that so easy and those are not easy
Prison looks different

Save
Солнце светит……
Might try for 6mts
Good work right here
Savages
I love seeing stuff like this. It's a reminder of the shocking capability of your body.  When you consider simple exercises that most would find difficult (like push-ups/pull-ups), then realize that you can grow to do those exercises by the tens... It's quite amazing.
Rumour has it that a full round of that is 1 rep of 150
I would forget half of this
I like just for mike tyson.love from india  bro
I watched this video too way many times 😅
Great
Tuff
I would give anything to be this fit
it hurts just to look at. pretty good
150 times 😂 hell no. 10 times for me.
Looks fun and spicy❤ I could see my arms cursing me out 😅
Reminder, nothing is tougher than a bullet.
Crossfitters be like

I got a good one of those in me lol
What is the benefit of this workout?
Perhaps this is my chance to be fit.
Doing that 150set💀
Aaaand that’s 1 rep, 19 more to go 🫥
That look fun, fina try it out
Lol you know this from the yard lol. But next time try with cards.
Why is it when a black guy is doing something, all the comments are like, “it’s good seeing a brotha doing something positive, or glad he’s doing this than selling drugs, or he’s motivating his own community”. When a white man doing the same thing, you see white people say that crap?
You getting strong for what aint like yall gone fight da police or stand up for black people against the corrupt justice sysytem so again what we doing here🤨
Awesome!  This is clearly level 37...where is the video on level -1?  Like how do i get here?

Beast!
Too smooth with the instructions! Respect!
Not in the grass tho….smh.
What a Delicious site😋 Just Yummie!

Para q eran los guantes y la sentadilla
THAT’S GOOD MONEY🔥🔥🔥🔥 Gotta save this and share it 🫡🙌🏆
It will take 15 cycles of that set to get 150 pushups.   I don’t know if my heart can take it.
I thought this is easy and then i tried it... I stop when i touch my knee
My muscles were sore and I couldn't move for a few weeks after I followed this.
a daily routine!
Prison trash
My nose touches the earth…hard as I attempt the first move 😂
Warriors
Way too complicated 😂
I cant even do a pushup blud💀💀💀
Each round is 10 pushups long. Do 15 rounds and that's your 150
80% of this is useless
Yall need a water girl 💁🏽‍♀️💁🏽‍♀️💁🏽‍♀️💁🏽‍♀️😂
So after the squat is that 1?
“Imma need one of dem, get me one of those”
Ya sniffing dog pee
Prison work outs ain't no joke!

*crawls back up*  “Okay, and that’s 1. I need 150 of them.”  I would’ve just walked away and pretend like I was lost. “Oh, you know what? This ain’t typing class. I’m in the wrong place.”😂😂😂
"The instructor is definitely a white guy  Don't ask me how i know that"
Sheesh love this for them. Cant wait to build this type of strength

Going to forget something
🤗hard work
I think you should do 10 squats at the end since you do 10 pushups to balance out the legs.
those exercises are money👍
thx dude
Like it or not, some of them focusing on the quality, while most focusing on the quantity.  Actual gains is not by "coolness" or "showy". So, what's the haste for? Just saying.
Oh hell nah. Homebody explaining has like .2% of body weight 😭 like immediately no.
Mad Sus
Prison workout
You’d be dead before the fourth

This is extremly easy. Am i god?
Very dumb. Just do 5 100 second pushups. My wrestling coach made me do either 50 or sumwhat close to 100 for vaping or being ineligible. I sat there shaking face on the mat for a fat while and wothin a week i was probly the one person wrestling with infinite chest and bicep endurance to ever step on the mats. I deadass felt like superman that was probly rhe worst best punishment i ever had and no weights needed fast recovery and INSANE results.
me at the beginning of the video: well touching shoulders is not that bad me at the end: OH HELL NAH
Im doing it
Prison name💀 Just playing....chill
I love it 🔥🔥
I might be able to do that but we’ll probably never know.

I need friends like you guys
I'm getting tired just watching...
I did one and I was like “fuck it it aint too bad”  10-15 later and im drippin in sweat
This is a prison yard workout, saw this all time
I’m ashamed to admit that not only would I be dying at the 4th step, I’d probably forget what came after the toe touch.
How many pushups series  like that ?
all men should do this. its helps with everything, including curing porn addictions.
I don't do nothing somebody weighing half what I weigh do. I can't do what you do and you can't do what I do.
Respect👍
Federal prison property
On the prison yard 😂
Be honest, how fast did you skip this video when the words oh hellnah  immediately came to mind😅
🇲🇽🙌👏👌🤟
this is a lot of core too. nice variation
💪🏽💪🏽🔥🔥🔥
I would make it 2 rounds at most. Pushups are the bane of my existence
150 of this? No way
This shit is so retarded, go learn anything about muscle building or conditioning. Unless you’re training for a push up competition, there’s no reason to do this
salchichon?
Where is this?! Just want to make sure I don’t sign up by accident 😂😂😂
Что ага? Отжались 10 раз от силу. Нужно 50 раз отжиматься. Слабенькие

my toxic trait is thinking i could do this (i will faint)
I don’t  like calisthenics
Który z nich będzie miał 55lat i tak robił ? a to nie koniec życia prawda? . Wydaje mi się że żaden nie dotrwa w sprawności do tego wieku .
For those wondering, this exercice develops absolutly no muscle and you do it only to flex that you can.
You have to eat buddy!
Look at all those chicken legs!
Need to work them legs out😂😂

Wod street!
What prison is this at
lame workout
This is completely unnecessary for strength building, but for endurance building. It would definitely help the shoulders. So many better options though.
I will be on the floor after 1 rep. 😅
Did 4 sets of this…….died and ate McDonalds Chocolate Chip cookies to think about my next choices in life.
Prison workouts.
I have a new goal.
Push up Do the dishes Push up  Take out the trash Push up  Walk the dog

Accurate representation of amount of leg work to upper body work most gym bros do

Inspired and ready to try this and die
This is superb!
Push up, Eat ur food  Push up, go to school  Push up, like the video  Push up, scroll down .
I like push-ups, but this is insane. I got a hand it to him. It’s impressive.
I’ll die
So do you include every single push up you did while doing this or is that one rep, for the push ups to 150??
This is serious advance workout.
All these guys are beasts who r they
What if my stomach in the way?
I would've hurt my face already at the crawl part
Damn imagine all that energy being put at a job 😲
Watch me do my toeeeyy touch my toeeyyy touch
That looks like it's military...  Imagine an entire community of young people syncing in on this and building their collective strength, unity, and group conscience together?😅
Damn.
I’m on my way to McDonald’s.
most of those dudes need to learn to do a proper push up before impregnating the air
An not one muscle was built today
Apparently nobody has heard of the term "junk volume" 😂
Bro weighs 103 pounds
Good work. This is the type of stuff I love to see us doing.

That workout is no joke!
Bro threw it back while saying Mike Tyson😂😂 I’m done

Monkeys at the jungle gym.
That's 1
Have fun staying small
Tough niggas factory
for people just starting. dont worry about how fast you are... just get it done, keep up a good pace.. do this 20-30minutes. you dont even have to eat 100% correct. just 70-80%. if anything eat good sunday-thursday. part the friday and saturday
How do i save this video?
May i ask? How many reps for this routine? Thank you for your motivation.
Wow!!😮
Mad respect those guys are Maschines greetings from Germany 🇩🇪..dom aka the mechanic
He forgot to yell "Euro! Training!" 😂
What the hell yall training for? 😂😂😂😂 gah damnnn
Why bother having the 1 squat that adds no value?
Yard work get that money!
💯💯💯
🔥🔥🔥
Ill be honest. Im stupid enough to forget which part I was at around halfway through. I do want to do this routine looks burning and productive.
I like it no burpees 😅
I get bros in good shape but idk if I wanna take fitness advice from someone who’s 120 lbs soaking wet
how much the first one
Cool but what’s the point if you only end up looking like the first guy
Are Smart phones allowed in prison
add weight or move on to harder exersise, incresing the number of reps is just a waste of time, and doesn't lead to the same growth rate. like do a harder version of the pushup, or just put weight on your back.
Easy money let's go..
Hey i have been doing these and i actually got a 98.5 on my last pt test. Do you have a meal plan
Man take those damn gloves off😂
Yes sir and yes sir.
i'm just glad "they" didn't change LMNOP to LBTQ+ 😁
Instead of 1 squat hit 20 so it can really burn
Naw you doing to much 😂 same results with half the work... Just because you work more doesn't mean your working smart/hard, it just means your killing your body an will regret it later in life. 😂
Can I ask what body parts it targets? I also wanna do this
Watching this, while eating popcorn with red rooster, smoking my wake and bake before work... Fuck I gotta get back in shape
Trying these later
Damn they got bootcamp for the racewar now
I guess there is not that much of a difference in gains, doing this 40 times or 150 times. Other than injuring yourself.
Gang of Slaves😂
Most folks are on the couch eatin cornchips while ya'll are gettin after it!😂
At this point a lot of the exercises I’m seeing on reels and ads are more of a “flex” than anything. Proper form and pushing yourself to “failure” is what’s most important not trying to look as “cool” as possible. I would simplify this drill into a different push up everyday instead of mixing them up into one super set. Focus on your target area for the day and leave some for the rest of the week 🦾🏋🏽
1619: Yea dont worry..i got the money.
By the time I get to Push Up Mike Tyson I'm kissing the floor passed out
I just did around 10 and cant breathe! These aint no joke holy shit!!

How many sets big bro
Push up no hands 😅
Easy when your 100lbs wet
I lost track
Pusher touch the dick
Anything pass touch your knee is useless all unnecessary 💩 just do reps to touch your knee and you'll be fine😂
Impressive. Most of this can also be done at an incline for those of us who really only have 1-2 good pushups before they become inchworms. That's my start and I hope I can get this down by the end of the year. Thanks.
1!…………………………..2!……………………3!….
How many of these are they doing ?
Not only are their handshakes complicated so are their pushups 😅
SORRY TO TELL YOU, BUT THIS IS JUST CRAWLING ON THE GROUND AT THIS POINT !!!
Mike Tyson one is zesty.
First night trying this, and I just want to say, “Thank you” and “Son of a *^%# you piece of *^%#%>”….I’ll be loving this and regretting this tomorrow. 😂
Now we working “ 💯
Shut t f u n drink
Sometimes I regret my athletic past...im 40 now and all of my joints are like rusted struts on an old school 😂  If i was pro i would happily be retired andlimping to the bank 😂 dream big kids! Take careof yourself!
Is this good for your chest growth too?
Lemme lay out this complicated routine and then shout at you the whole time so youcan lose track of what your doing
Man he doing like its so easy😂. That a crazy hard push up
I like to do this when i take a hit or two of some good meth.

I think he not hacker because one time I shot a enemy with AKM all of bullets is headshot. After match I go to moment and I see not open scoop .
Mike Tyson push ups and squats result to negative stress heart palpitation and body overheating, dizziness ,etc.  Please look into sport medicine.
Now add a burpee at the end, followed by a pull up, and then 5 jumping jacks
Ngl I would forget what to do halfway thru all that
No White Men's? Racist video.
Prison burpees remember these
“Push up— Mike Tyson. Push up— P Diddy”
It's cute that the algorithm thinks I can do a single regular pushup. 😅 Halfsies for me!
What's that Mike Tyson about?😂
I pray my coach doesn't see this, especially in this heat
This is easy for me, I probably have really bad form
This looks freaking great! Will add this to wo
Dats it, there!🙌🏾
Stop calling that shit a Mike Tyson push up it’s called a prowler push up gah damn
Even better? A different type of push up every time.
Do one rep soon as you get out of bed in the am. You either going to lay down the rest of the day, or hustle harder than you ever have in your life😂
Look at this n*ggas with attitudes
Can you write that down 😂
Great technique
Well done
“Lets go yall got 100 of em”
I wanna date one of you
I'm 19

Push up mike Tyson: and he turns into a frog
Bro wildin with the ski on 😭
You have to be fairly light to do a lot of these.
150 gah damn I applaud that 😂
Tremenda rutina viejo! La pondré en práctica
I think I can literally do one round. I am going to try tonight.
This reminds me of going through 12 months of basic training, advance Infantry training, and 6 months of OCS (Officer Candidate School) before becoming a 2nd Lieutenant in the US Army. At 22 years old, I could do this. Sets the tone for the rest of your life!!
Deaf people watching the video: 😃 Blind people watching the video: 💀
Gangster get your mind and body together

Bro is type of guy who dribble while doing pushups
How many rounds of this sequence do you have to do? Will want to start this tomorrow morning.
And then they go outside their jail and they are ready to do something wrong again.
Prison workouts👍🏾 in the hood
Push up  Shoulders  Knees Feet Ground feet Mike Tyson/pounce Crawl up Feet squat

Lol
This is slow twitch exercise. Depends what you want
I don't think I can even do one full set properly
That are not push-ups, it's pussy-ups. U should go twice deeper
Damn
🐒
This explains the chicken legs

Strong men ! Blessings kings
That's one
Crazy 🎉
So why can't they work out alone? 😂😂😂
Crazy 💪
This routine is the reason why everyone comes out of prison absolutely jacked
30+ years ago I could do this easily.. (military) Barely do 5 push-ups now (old and 2 heart attacks)
And got the nerve after it be like “that’s one! Now do 3 sets of 10!” I can’t wait until I’m in shape enough to start doing these!
I'll get probably like 3 reps but this is fire tho 🔥🔥
is this prison? so many kneegears in one place
Growing up. Sure wish this Was my crowd. For real though.
Watching blacks do criminal calisthenics - LMAO so typical.  # that passed math and english: 0
Men are amazing ❤
Are the UPS package handler gloves required? Been trying to find them before I start doing the little floor jig.
I soiled myself
9✖️50= 450  That's gd money 💰
9×17=153  9×16=144 Reps✖️sets odd # reps makes it strange to hit 150 cut ✂️ out the Mike Tyson push-up & it's 8 reps  8reps✖️19sets=152
How many sets are yall doing
Dude, I’m gonna start using this for Brazilian jujutsu, I’m sick of using kettlebells. Thanks for the tip.
WHERE ARE THEYYYYYYY??!!!🤦🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🥵🥵🥵
Sheesh bro!

That’s good money for real
HEAR ME OUT: If ALL of us stop working out, nobody has too! 😂

Why the fuck they calling em baby boy. Shit gay as hell
watching while I eat chips. Cool, next video
How many of these y’all really do a day nd keep it a buck 50
The hardest part about this workout is remembering it.
Prison work out
Honestly, I'm able to do 70 clean push-ups in a rep, whether it is diamond push-ups or open push-ups and by the time I'm done with push-ups for the day, I'd have completed 500 push-ups. About 8yrs ago, I used to hit the gym in my country for 6yrs since I was 14 but about a couple of years ago, I realized push-ups is very effective and better with no complications and now some ppl at work take advice from me to build up muscles though some still think I hit the gym
Damn bro this is brutal just by seeing it, burpees already killing me and these guys mixes these?! Props to them
🧑🏿🧑🏿🧑🏿🧑🏿🧑🏿🧑🏿🧑🏼🧑🏿🧑🏿🧑🏿
How many sets of these i have to do
Mike Tyson ❤
Also me belly gets in the way
I tried I can't. Bat back and shoulders
Shit's about to pop off on the yard.
Next video will be of cops harassing them
I love these type of exercises but I've always found push ups very  hard.😢
I gotta know, how many people were watching the guy second to the left, front row just by instinct?
Sign me up
first guy, light as a feather: "why y'all struggling? it was easy!"
Seessshhhhhhhhh gangʻbanğ
Boy over half aren't even doing 1 clean rep. Lol
how many they hittin ? 10 reps of it ?
Lmfao this is sad.
Respect but i ain't rememebering all that 😂
You're telling me that the whole drill is 1 push up and you have to do 150? Get Out of here
This is the most unemployed thing I have seen in my life, ain’t nobody with the job doing this shit
the problem is to memorize all steps...😂
Mike Tyson???
So bending over in the doggy position is called a Mike Tyson? 😂
He didnt wanna say *touch your toes* cause he knows that big pause 😂
His head looks like a ball shack
I js did this as a 13 yr girl and it was easy

Yardwork.Thats good money.someone been through the system.
? Help me out I’m 5 11 150. Sometimes 160 crazy up and down I know I don’t eat as much get full fast idk why want to be 230 😅
Definitely an endurance workout. Gonna be hard to build a ton of strength because you’re raising your HR constantly BUT I imagine these guys are more interested in athleticism not raw strength?
I’m going to try this! ❤
The Blackman is GOD!!

Thats dope  Reminds me of unity within the walls but big difference yall are free 🫡
So if my husband saw me watching this he’s be upset BUT I DIDNT GO LOOKING FOR THIS!! It was a shirt that just popped up
I like that for that imma sub and I expect more nice shit lmfao
Plot twist: all of them was done after one set😂😂😂
Bros teaching them the prison pushup "and that's 1"  "How many of these are we doing?" "1100, and if you back out, you don't eat tonight, go,"
They had to do it more than one time?
Wow! Im gonna try to do this

Overcomplicated Push Up Overcomplicated Push Up Overcomplicated Push Up Overcomplicated…  (Y’know, adding a bunch of wrinkles and twists into a basic exercise doesn’t make it “better”.  Just a bunch of unnecessary smoke and mirrors.  But hey, works for the “look at me” folks out there I guess.  🤷‍♂️)
Do it in the open with good fresh air from nature makes you natural.
🎉🎉🎉

That’s good money fasho 🎉

Terry cruise workout
It's always so cool to see people doing really difficult exercises but executing them like it's just breathing. The instructor was SO smooth and effortless it had me thinking I could do it easy too.
Dude is creating his own army 😅

Trying this
This is a harvest ground for warriors

Adding this to my routine
of often you should repeat that for training?
I could do one set of that 😂 150 sounds INSANE
He made it look so easy, this is too good
Training for the yard my brothers lol
Very Very Useful. Thank You.
Imagine having a bunch of these fit healthy young mean working for you 100 years ago would have been great!
Hood military without the military

150 of that is absurd 10 is impressive
Breathing in dirt while exercising is crazy work. 🫁
Nice
I’d lowkey just forget the routine, this shit got hella steps😭
Ima do this, wish me luck 🙏
I can do like 75% of one set. 🤐
That's good Money$$$
30 push ups 1 squat, no wonder their bicep is bigger than their quads. Skinny legs everywhere
💯
Rea Dy for Ukraine
I know the trainer is strong so he can do those push up demonstrations smooth and slow, but shouldn’t everybody else be trying to go slow? Just because they get through the cycle doesn’t mean they did any correct form push ups. I’m asking because I’m genuinely curious
I'm still on the shoulder and they walking away!! 😆😆😆
He makes it look easy, he also weighs like 10lbs.
How much?
That's one
My high ass thought this was NLE for a second ☠️
Imagine doing that in pads
It's better if u put feet together when doing push ups better for your core . But nice routine
Mike tyson
Interesting
Wow! You almost did 1 real pushup!
Sir, I bench 65 lbs
oooooooooh maaan¡¡¡
I know but is hard to keep balance wile moving a lot
Pushups are muscle cardio. Good exercise for sure but def not going to build a lot of muscle from pushups. Incline bench fa sho!
That's  an awesome workout ❤🎉
Oooooo
Let’s GETT ITTTT, About this.

Reminds of when I was locked up
This is one rep of 10. 5 series.
*"PUSHUP MIKE TYSON!"* 🥊😂🥊
Working out is already good for your brain so remembering this patter and executing it kind of doubles that I feel.
Bro building the new Spartan Army.
Guys you need to Repent Jesus is coming soon
So I thought I was toxic for thinking I could do this....but I actually did it twice 😂 when I say the company with the smile work the dog shit out of you. Work where they ship smiles is the only time I truly felt like a nigg*
That's like a suicides :")
Como que pucha?
I'm feelin this routine! 💯
Im about to do tjos shiy right ohhh yeaaa
One singular squat is mad work 😂
I can't even do 1 push up
This is insanity. I hope I can do one rep one day 🥺
I’d be in heaven surrounded by all these fine men…
Im dead.
I can’t even get 1 rep 😩
If I may suggest, quality is more important than quantity, guys...
Crucial
When I was in the feds I exercised with some dudes and they had a routine that was similar.    That crawl out and crawl up seems simple af.. but it breaks ya😂
Whose gonna carry the boats! Les Go 🔥
Pushup goto sleep

Is this a high-school or a prison?
This super push up is deceptively hard to do multiple of
"That is only one: I need 20, from everyone....."😒😭
Pg county activities

What y'all training to be vigilantes
I just finished a full body workout, and every single muscle in my body is telling me to not do this, but my brain is telling me do it, what do I do
Imagine doing all this to get smoked by a 100lb teenager 😂😂
Y’all need a team manager or… 👀
Fire no lie 💪🏾
Push-Up, I’m on the ground😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

SHHIID 😂
Looks REALLY good.. Thats naughty that.. Burn burn burn..
I would’ve forgot that routine in a heartbeat
Are they training for the next slavery?
Damn I'm a big gurl but I'll take thus class👀
Regular burpees do it 2 count
That looks amazing and miserable at the same time

Look at all these Melanated men
Need a name for this push up it's very impressive
Okay let's get it I like that workout

Some of these people can’t follow directions😂
😅
doing all that in the heat with ski mask is wild
He was demonstrating one set, they probably now on their like 6th set
This dope black men 💪🏾❤️💯🙏🏾🙌🏾
So now i realized intensity is another way of hypertrophy than weights and volume
Por que estao no sol? Tem algo por tras?
"Push-up, Mike Tyson" idk why but i lol. This looks damn tough
Зделай свою кровь киселем

Why can't you just do regular push-ups and regular squats going to get the results😂😂😂
😂wtf😂
Pussha
That’s 1!
Yur lack of results tell me that's just a circus for the camera or something else. Real routines as already invented
Rhis looks like pain😅
I guess all the prison workouts became the thing now
Cool. But he's talking too much.
If anyone’s wondering that’s 10 pushups so 15 rounds of that
Sweaty 🥰🤗

Is this timed, or a matter of reps? I want to do this with my group
Green shoe guy needa work on them legs tho
The guy in the back was dying😂😂
Why are you bent over for Mike Tyson?
That crawl up would be the hardest part for me 😂
I think I lost my keys over there in that area! 😮‍💨
Hardest part is remebering all that when your shoulders are falling out
Hopefully the end comes with a sandwich or two for the homies. From what I saw all needed a few except maybe 1 or 2 🤣
Them bitches was clean too😫
What ps3 game is this?
Mike Tyson?
how long does 150 of these end up taking? i mean.. 20 would definitely be gassed already
That’s money 🔥
Why he say Mike Tyson though?
Why is Mike tyson work out throwing it back?? 😂
This is no joke
One squat for 20 push-ups gonna look a little top-heavy better train them legs chickens

I'm eating doritos in my underwear
Have you ever not been able to do a pushup?
If all of that is one rep then I can do 5 max
Mmmmm I’d be dead within the first three positions 😂
ouuuu im do this lol
I'm doing that shyt rn thanks G!
Now time to get some calories in
if this was TikTok or insta...
This vid went crazy 🔥🔥🔥🔥 s/o good money
INDEED! Iykyk lol
Lord pls my coaches should not see this
Q
This is why you should stay in school and go to college. Don't do drugs.
I like it
So 10 in the routine. And we do this 15 times.
I can do a lot of push ups in a row but I did not look ANYTHING like this when I tried this the first time😂
Bruh
The person showing them wat to do did it so effortlessly
I was waiting for the “and that’s one” 😅
I’d love to find a Group of Fulliz like this that would be keen for a Stay in the Grind and Smash Dem Gains.
Just bench press.
🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥 No woman? I’d be there. Maybe I’m not as strong but I can do it 💪💪💪
After 2 minutes of fame Routine:push up ,touch steroids Push up,take steroids Look up,you're buff💀😹
He sounds so... 🌶 At the end there😏
How many reps?
Nice workout. It looks like it might be very challenging at first. ❤
Oh ish definitely about to try that looks like a good workout 💪🏾 👌🏾
My shoulders hurt after trying this 10 times
Hard work; hard work!!!🤗🤗🤗
It don't matter if there fake there still gorgeous ✨✨
Can I buy 2 off you? I got 1,500,000

Why does it look like the Mike Tyson one is opening his ass
Fella doing the pushups on the left is an animal
Who thirsty...me walking through serving drinks before getting escorted out

Uuuuuuu thats the Hell 😂🥶😭

Lol unrelated but He sounds like he’s from DC
Bootcamp PT🫡💪🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
WHOA! 😢
This right here will have your whole body burning 🔥
🤤
This looks like a prison routine and is no joke.
This is the DEMOCRATS nightmare
This is like a basic workout in prison. Not hating I’m just saying there’s nothing special about it. I just think it’s funny how things come come out on the street from prison and it’s like they’re brand new.
🔥🔥🔥
Can’t wait to buy these in 2 years for a great price.
And yet id put $100 that none of them are at grade reading level
So much time between squats, basically ain't getting no leg work 😂😂
Yo I gotta learn this but I’m slow as hell so I gotta do this on my own pace
Way too much..
real footage of homo sapien migration from africa
GET THAT CHESR TO THE FLOOR
Glorified cardio
😍😍😍😍😍😍
I felt tired just watching this 😂😂
Ok good that's one!
Too easy try something new
This looks like the intro’s to my p*#n vids 😂
It doesn’t need to be that complicated. Just get out there and do Burpee’s for 10 to 20 minutes straight every day and you will be a beast after a couple months.
Big yard money💪🏿
I ain't even doing the drill and I'm saying “Boy F**k you.”
I used to do these was a beast at it
I can appreciate this type of fitness instruction.
I don't think this was meant to hit my account, everyone else is so encouraged, I just want one
Gonna try these, not looking forward to it lol
Best vip for live
I feel like I could do this even thought I’m I haven’t been able to do a single push up my entire life
I got 1 good push-up lol
He ain't even doing 150 of those 😂
I’m out of breath
"1!"
Who else is tired just watching 😂
This is awesome 👏🏽
UMD type shi
Gng I a die😂😂
I want to come back to this later.
this is the leg day yeah?
I have a problem that prevents me from doing ANY type of heavier push movements, my inner left elbow starts hurting extremely bad after a number of reps, this only happened after a mountain bike accident I had while loading my downhill bike onto the truck rack, I threw it up with speed and it's metal spiked pedal slammed hard into my elbow, some of the worst sharp pain I've ever experienced, my arm felt messed up and numb for short while after that.... this happened like 7 years ago... when I try to tell people they just don't take me seriously... can anyone offer any sort of advice?.. I want to fix this.
Damn that sun is out on they backs
Wth?! They aren’t human at all, They’re away beyond! 🤩
😮
My Guy Red taught me those. He calls them pit bulls. I was doing them like 10 years ago. He has some with the pullup bar, too. I'm 50, and still can fade these.
Excellent!!
what shoes are those
love this
Dis dat jail workout
Eurotraining pre-workout?
❤❤❤
Think I'd spend more time thinking about what's next
And that's 1
Australian Olympic break dance
Yup, endurance training like that is crazy, I don’t know the context of their whole program but to a bodybuilder and.Personal trainer I’d be worried about overtraining. This is more than 15 sets of a single movement. My opinion it’s just like the child like notion of more is better. In this case I would cut the pushups way down and work other body parts. Overtraining is easy to do for strong heavy athletes. The goal is to do as little as possible to achieve the desired result! 🫡
O my goodness beautiful shades of black kings 🤴🏾 ❤️‍🔥😻
Love this a lot
I want to join and do these
Duuuuude that looks like a workout
Impressive
Did one …. I swear it felt like forever 😂
Head shoulders knees and toes knes and toes i get it
You're strong, but straighten those knees! You could go lower with straight legs. Even if you can only do half the reps, it's better than doing double crappy reps.
I got tired listening to the set😂😂😂😂
I tried the should tap stuff once and I couldn’t be how much balance I needed just to do it and that was at a slow pace
Damn if i was 16 or 18 i would of been able to do all this but now i can barely do 20 normal push up but ill remember this workout im definitely gonna try this in the future
PUSHUP TOUCHO SHOULDER🗣️🥶🥶🥶🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My boyfriend love doing these. I think its a magic trick. I just love watching. I have done them... I stop after the 2nd "touch your knee"
Crazy workout.. salute
You call it warmup. I call it a day.   We are not the same.
Like back in them days
Where is this at?!?
Hope my coach don’t see this🙏💀
What does this work out exactly?
I like dat, respect...
Shoc camp
Excuse me sir, I'm stuck with the push up part, can you offer me any advice please?
Got dam. I can't wait to get to this exercise one day.   Dam, that looks like a killa.
Yea I done that next day I could barely move my arms above my head 😂
I just go to the gym and am twice your size, for endurance I go swimming and lets see how good your endurance is when you have to control your breath also and use every muscle in your body.
Я долистала до конца шортов именно шортов ☠️
Jail life
One day this will be me 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Who heard Mike Tyson 😅
They know the routine
Synchronized would've looked 🔥
I did two set of 15 n dam it hurt so good  I recommend this work out
What's the benefit?
This is the devil's burpee
How can I do this doing girl pushups?
I’m gonna start with 10 regular pushups and go from there. Serious question, this has to be a great full body workout right?

That looks grueling. Fantastic work yall
He makes it look soooo easy 😢
Good job guys 👏🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾   Ladies, come join me over here and we can just watch and enjoy the view.
The black dudes working out at the park are the most motivated yet crazy mfs on the planet. IDGAF what you say. 9am they in the park yelling  “This light work dawg, I can’t be fucking stopped nigga, I’m undefeated in this bitch.” With a bunch of kids on the jungle gym 30 yards away from em
Damn gotta try this next month sometime in the future maybe sunday next year in july 2025 if i am feeling well. But i might be busy that day actually, I will  find time someday after that.
I'm doing this in intervals of 1 rep 😅
Psalms 51:10     “Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.”  King James Version (KJV)
That shit gets you cut up
Why they got mf garden gloves on
Beautiful to see. So many brothers working in unison. Salute
No lie I trained in the gym for about 5 -6 I work in the warehouse  I started doing 350 pushups daily or more (diff variations)  And I've gained so much muscle I'm so much stronger in the gym  My pecs are f***ckn crazy   Please 🙏🏽 my gym brothers DOOO THESE! May the protein be with you 😂💪🏽
Says who
This isy new morning routine. Im only doing 10 of these as of now. Ill get up
Used to be on post in the yard and seeing people do this everyday but they’ll run to the nearest corner of the track.
Ok that’s 1. Only 149 more
I am 42 and trying to get back healthy. I have 4 babies to live for. Thank you for sharing. Keep motivating the world.
These routines are great but mental fatigue is a problem. I only manage weighted dips and squats for this reason.
Gud Luks.
This looks like pain
They fine😊
Send these niggas to the military.
Hardest part is memorizing
Its giving Yo Gabba Gabba 🤭🤭 Iykyk

Me in basic training
I got winded watching this. Good workout!
Noooooooooooooo
Oofda
Diddy training
The cops got called three time by the neighbors
THAT’S ONE..
Now Were Building a Army
This push up looks similar to the israel x mililtary push up but they would need to do it 600-1000 in 2hr but i heard they do some instead of chest it would be the back
Wow 👀
I need a nap😂
You can do that when you weigh just 120 lbs soaking wet. I am not impressed. Gain 60 lbs then do this same exact rep set 😅😅😅
Which prison is this? Lol jk
Jail boys for tight arses don’t they
I ran around a football field 5 times almost every day, but it doesn't seem as if i am gaining any speed. Do u know why?
Looks similar to what we used to do in boot back in the day!💪🏼
My body became sore just watching this
All you hear is “ahh” “hsss ssss”
❤
Can’t remember any of that shit
Now tell me what their reading and math levels are..
Nice
He onto something gonna try this
Only doing 1 rounds of that week finish you.

I know a prison workout when I see one
Push up, touch ur blls

Doing all that WHILE saying the moves & not even out of breath is very impressive
Yeah man big up great work💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥
Push ups while doing the macarena is wild ✊🏽
KINGS 🙏🏽👑👑👑👑👑👑👑❤️✅
How tf does mike tyson correlate with that move? lmao
Best WORKOUT IT BURNS🔥💥💪🏻

DAMN! If they put this much effort into life and doing the right thing they would have never ended up in prison!
Lord have mercy on my soul
Push up I'm straight on all of this
Damn fine ass dudes
🔥🔥🔥
Their body’s look like they do 100 pushups for every 5 squats
I know that’s right brothers, y’all working 💪🏾💯
It was over for me at the crawl out in the beginning 😂😂 I can barely do women push ups 😂
Totally underrated workout, u can get bigger than most would think doing this workout, work till failure, eat and get your protein in within the first 15-30 minutes after workout and you’ll see the gains
And he did it like a breeze
I’m on it…let’s go
Positive outlooks....get it
This is so Pilates coded
I did one set of this just cause this came on my feed. Thank you for inspiration to do something.
Knees is hurting from watching. Halfway through the 1st one...Faceplant! 😂😂😂
I would've forgotten everything after the push up
Theres more than one kind of pushup just so you guys know
You lost me at push up you wanna repeat that?😂
Praying to god my coah does not see this
This is an awesome challenge
NAME AND SHAME
see this be tht bull shi where u know it good work buh a bitch to do buh yk u gon love the result after so jus get it done 💀
Does full rotation count as 1 rep
Looks phenomenal for endurance, but all those steps and reps look like it'll be hard to exert the focus required for strength training.
Oh this is good work.
Let’s Go!!!! 💪🏾
whats the best set's for this
These boys about to make their own 300 Movie ✊🏿💪🏿🔥💯
Good job men, I'm proud of you as a fellow human.
This little guy splinter level endurance….😮
I’m dead just from that first set
*Yaaaaass...YALL LOOK GOOD*

Ypur skinny
Strength

Necesito ese entrenamiento 😊

Nice we got good cotten harvester
This is a killer workout i gotta try it
😂😂😂 prison rules in effect 😂😂😂
Bro is  built  like a stick bug😂
Where do I attend? I just want to vote on the best form? And get a peek of some glistening melanin
Love black men working out not in jail. Great job black men
Too much shit for just one rep man
Does one full set count as one push-up. I'm confused about the reps?
Ngl I can't even do one full normal push up
Looks like Jail
Training for prison
Why homie gotta say yard work tho like get out that mindset man leave that life in the past g saying yard work sounds goofy you free my man
Imma try this tomorrow
Where do I sign up to be their water girl
Ok, I'm game
I did this routine yesterday right after watching the video. I'm feeling great today! Gonna do this at least a few times a week with my routine 💪
On the next episode of BLACKED!!! PH
Saying we got motion baby boy while a bunch of shirtless men are moaning and grunting is wild. 💀
Push up touch your meat…
10 push-ups with a squat for a small rest
☠️She tried it
You know all these mfs don’t remember all that the first time around 😂😂
What prison is this?
Add that to my workout 💪🏾
I like that. I'm stealing that. How many reps do you usually do?
I'm going to try and start this tomorrow morning. 1 set the first week and add a set every week for 30 days.
Thats 1!
Yo this is dope
His calm delivery; followed by all the grunts! 😂😭🤣🤣🤣🤣 He made it look sooooooo easy. They had no idea. Most don’t. 🔥🔥🔥😏♥️
I freaking love this 🎉
I could not even with the first push up
Yard work forreal. 6 yes strong💪🏾
...didn't make it past the first knee & I did it on my knees!
And everyone solid on the form
Jim Crow
Great fucking warm up🎉🎉
Hope my coach don’t see this
Damn ❤❤❤❤😊
Nevwr seen a prison with that kind of sports equipment and fields. Pretty cool!
Diddy party training
This is retarded. Weight lifting, healthy eating and like 20 mins of cardio 3 times per week will get u jacked. This push-up routine is a huge waste of time and energy.
That's either prison or one big group of unemployed friends
Jokes on you, I can't even push down let along push up😅😢
That's to much to remember
I feel sore watching this
I don’t want no muscles.. I don’t want the job .. I don’t want the spot or that money !! Lol
Damn jail birds! Enjoy your freedom you always cry about.
Will add this to my workout list
Bien bro
They are working the fields harder than  their ancestorsl.
Can I actually get that on like an index card  No no no I can do it! It’s just a lot to remember is all. 😂
Amazing work, keep your elbows locked in you’ll thank me later. Never ever flare your elbows you don’t want to know why.
Imagine somebody doing that more than once
Shit, I got tired just watching them😢😂
Push up face in the ground!! 😂
Damn I tried it yall....fuck that imma just watch
Add a jump at the end reach for the sky 💪 mines a bit different
How many tho… kuz I know it’s not 150 of all that
❤😅
Should I do this if I’m out of shape?
I’ll just watch thanks 😂
The cameraman keep going boy
15sets of 10s. I gotta do this one next pushup session
“Push up- pull your pants down.  Push up- let the guy behind you rail you real quick” 😭😭😭😂😂
Dude in the white and glasses disappeared fassst af! 😂😅
MIKE are you watching this😂
Beast!
This had the same energy as Robin Williams from The Birdcage. The rehearsal scene. Tell me I'm lying😅
Push Up, salchichón, push Up, salchichón
What does touching your shoulder and feet between push ups do??
That Diddy not Tyson
One rep and I’m dead
Touching the shoulders, knees, and feet do absolutely nothing for building strength or flexibility of the exercise. Its literally just to make it longer and more exhausting without a payoff. 😂
I would’ve been passed out 😂 😂 too many push ups for me 😂😂
All i can think about is how this MFers not itching like crazy on that grass😂😮😢😢
Thanks I hate it.
GOOD MONEY👍
Notice he's not doing it fast. This is all based on endurance, making it incredibly more difficult but allows you to flow better and gain better results
I got prison vibes. Anyone else?
Hello! I just wanted to come and spread the good news of Jesus Christ! He loves you so much and wants you to be saved more than you want to be saved! please make sure your speaking and acting in a way that glorifies God! If you want to accept Christ as your Lord and Savior just genuinely say this prayer: “Jesus, i’m sorry for all of my faults, please forgive me for all my sins and fill me with your spirit, It’s been very hard to live for you but please give me ease, at this very moment I declare and believe in my heart that Jesus is the Son of God, Jesus is Lord and that He rose on the third day to save all sinners! Thank you for what you’ve done for me and please restore my soul with you! IN JESUS NAME AMENN!!” Jesus loves you! 💟✝️
After all that you say, ONE!  3 sets - 10 reps please
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Where are the white guys😂
And that’s 1😂😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏🏿💪🏿💯
Reminds me of basic training.😊
I’ve been going to the wrong playground…😂😍😍❤❤❤
Yes very good but they should slow it down adding speed means less effort on the muscles take your time let it kill you
nigga you a joke🤦
A very scary prison film.
This is like Euro Training from My Wife and Kids
Holy crap!
150? I only do 5 of these everyday 10 if I do it at night
I'd have to get on a blood pressure medication regimen and get this approved by a medical doctor before I could try any of this! But it looks awesome.
I hate routines like this. All shoulders
Much more harder in reality😭😭😭
Savage as foook
Tried this today i died 2 times 😂 killer routine 💪😈
11 push up 1 squat = chicken legs
Bro is working out with a ski mask🗿
My goofy ahh "oh we was pose to touch feet 2 times? My bad" 😂😂😂
Now try bench 120kg lol. You look Aesthetically good. But body resistance training is weak as fuck. Your body is naturally able to carry itself. It may look impressive. But its no more impressive than walking to the grocery store. Even a beginner at the gym would put all you to shame. Your body doesn't come from having muscle. All you're seeing is dangerously low body fat. Literally everyone has a 6 pack, it's just covered in a layer of fat. But not everyone can deadlift 250kg or squat 300kg. You lot couldn't deadlift 100kg 😂😂
I didn’t know MIKE TYSON had a PushUp named after him..that’s legendary!
🥊🔥
Bet finna get it in
Dang I gotta try this now
150?!
Sayains on Namek would be proud lol
“Euro Training”. - in my terry cruise voice
U not pushing nothing you crazy skinny
Is that a prison yard?
Advanced solid 10 push ups.
I will try ty
Wow! Definitely saving this! 😮😮😮😮
En serio está jente me da mucha satisfacción ❤❤❤
I’m doing regular push-ups ngl
No thank you
And that whole process is for 1 pushup. 149 to go :D
I can do 2 normal pushups
We got motion is crazy 🤪
Game time 🔥💪🏾
This routine is no joke it's all you vs you. 💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
Get them to all do it on the same beat and I bet itd burn more
How many reps? FIVE?
Bro forget the strength, the hard part is remember what you need to do while suffering for your life.
we taking the prison workouts to the hood now?
Doing this workout routine in prison will have inmates telling you to raise your hips higher.
I love this!
This doesn’t do anything but make you tired
I've done this as a warmup for a full body session and it warmed me up goooood
Is this a prison?
Why he sound like king bach?
Adding 5 sets of ts to my workout rn
Reminds of my boxing days 🔥
This is what I would call a love-hate relationship with your body🥴
😢😢😢
We need more workout gangs like this in America does a bunch of guys come together and work in the hell out❤🎉 beautiful!!!
I can’t get past the Mike Tyson part 😪
Sb like this so I can come back
WE GOT MOTION  WE GOT MOTION
The waves doe
Prison work out
Coach used to be like “I asked you to do five things and you telling me you can only do it too times???” “Go head try again” then after he let you know you just did over 500
Boys.. would this be full body or still just upper?
Put your feet together
❤
It’s even impressive in the beginning when he’s just showing how to do it and yelling at the same time. I know major arms shoulders and more were burning that day!!!
I need to get back into shape and try this! At this stage i wild die on max no. 3
Woke up went straight to the floor. That was pretty easy lol can't lie
U want me to  remember all of that😂
Why are they teaching apes to do pushups?
🧐🫦
Whoever in the Xfinity building across the street looking at them like DANG!!! Glad it ain't me ! 😂 yall putting in that work fr
Lord Jesus! 😭
I NEED THIS
well well well well

How much for 2 of them?
Brutal

I spent 3 weeks just trying to remember if it was time for shoulder or knee!
That's greattt🔥🔥🔥
Sounds like bootcamp to me lol
Hardcore
Motivation  for black young men. Spread the word!
I wanted to hear a couple more “Push up - Mike Tyson” for complete satisfaction.
Somebody most definitely was on the federal yard with me😂😂😂 Good Work
Ppl don’t realize the power of a push up ! I challenged my boy from work to do as many pushups per day as possible for a full month. He said he couldn’t even do one, so I told him that’s perfect ! 2 weeks into it, he just showed off that he can bang out 25 pushups smoothly and says his wife saw a change in his physique. From not being able to do a single one to his wife noticing a change in 2 weeks! Don’t believe me!? Try it yourself , then use that momentum to change your life 🔥🔥🔥🔥
physical fitness baby good message great lessons keep it up
I just did one and 😅
Why you making hard for everyone.....that's good money tho
Soo uhhhhhhh theyy gettin ready for the fields.... 😂
That's full out federal prison work out add a superman in there after your Mike Tysons
Nah I’m bouta try that
I couldn’t even do this! You know what, imma do this everyday. Hopefully I can fully do this come the end of the month. I’ll come back to ya
Issei honestly seems dumb atleast emotionally if he sees numbers the way he claimed yhen everything can be explained by a value and they way he explained the magic shows he sees EVERYTHING no matter what as values so feeling should be the same he should be able to tell anything by value alone in e he recognizes patterens
I need one of them👀
Omg yal so fine! Love my black men❤
Imagine you are living and fighting for one purpose. Then imagine that purpose is stripped away with your own hands. Then you are soaked in pure evil for however long.  Megumi ain't a bum, he's just realistic
Bruh 😮
*tarzan voice* go-rilla
lol i couldn’t do this even if my life was on the line
Thanks for sharing this. Stuff like this is perfect for pre exhausting before a workout or just as a full routine when you got a full day/week where you can’t get to the gym. I’m about to be a new dad but I’m trynna stay fit and make gains, this is great for that
😂 whats with all the bitch mittens
And they are doing this outside in the heat, smh I’ll prey for you all
Great to young men take care of their temples!
They all looked like out of shape doing it. Sh!t is tough..
BBC heaven

Working out in the conditions of the outside definitely increase you in a positive way.
This is more of a conditioning exercise not the best for building strength but I’m still going to add these in. Good mobility and pseudo cardio

THAT WORK! 🫡! GOLD•P
Mean set!!!
Gotta love them prison routines
❤️‍🔥💪🏾❤️

Bunch of ex-convicts. Asked me how I know. I did 13 years in prison. They always wanted strength and numbers. I worked out alone. And that's why they thought I was the baddest mofo on the yard. I was

Al that’s missing is a white man with a wipe
This is the difference between men and women...Well according to my father anyway...a fat man is a lazy man and definitely not worth relying on..terrible but true! 😮😅
Push Up, file your taxes, push up, fight some ninjas, push up, lift a car, push up, do a flip.   Couldnt help but make it into a joke but putting that aside the burn of that workout is crazy.
120lb dudes doing push ups. Easy

Looking at greatness….few weeks of this I’m sure you can see and feel results…
Soooo how many sets are we suppose to do because we just did like fifty things in one set.
Sure, if you weigh 80lbs all of this is easy 😊

HOLY! I did one or two sets of this yesterday and everything hurts today. My chest, my traps, my shoulders and worst of all are my lats.  I do pull-ups on the regular and ignore pushups, so I never thought I could target the lats with pushups… I’m amazed 😮
I’m gonna be sore tomorrow from just watching this video 😆
I'm home😂
We need engineers and doctors bro all love though 😂
1 squat per 100 push ups 😂😂

It’s 150 straight or 150 divided into sets? Or maybe even 150 of those pushups ?
Definitely trying this today
Push up touch your meat😢
I aint against it but ill stick to weightlifting much more enjoyable and grows muscles a lot more with a lot less effort.  Good job though looks awesome
I don’t know how much this sucks but I can tell you that 25 the hard way is one of the most miserable exercises I’ve ever had to do and I had to do a lot of them. 😊
Great routine! Challenging but rewarding 💯
I been doing cross fit workout for a while iam happy to say iam doing this as my warm up routine this will keep you energized after learn this and gained levels
I’m not strong enough and that’s okay

Squat… that’s 1.
Though that was Ray J for a min
Love to see you guys getting after it! 💪🏼
Ima do this starting tomorrow …. I’ll be back to tell you how it went
10 push-ups in 1 rep is crucial 💪🏾💪🏾💥💥💥
Love this! Got to try it!
When your playing a game of horse for basketball with the boys, you just make shit on the fly and act like that’s what you ment . That’s what I’m getting here
Why not jus do regular push ups? Does this give more gains
Just tried it, it’s good 👍
This is insane!!!
What cell block is this
You dont need to do this if youre not in prison bro
Then after you do all that,  yell out "ONE!!!"
Prison is no joke
ONE.  Lmao reminds me of terry cruise in that one show.
Yal getting  money  RESPECT
This a diddy party.
Shout out to big bro in the white tee. Being a big dude trying to keep up with skill players is tough
I cant even do the puch up part
They gone thank them in the end !! but Ik they shoulders on fire
I hate burpees
All that to be small
I’m gonna have to do this in stages, I’m not fit like them anymore, 🤦🏾‍♂️
Eeeee yooooo that's tuff
iiiinch worm-out 🤣
This is a great workout once you get a little experienced. Keep it simple early though just do a couple pushup variations. Push yourself to failure by the end of the workout but dont burn yourself out. Keep pushin and have fun!!
Dang
If only they tried this hard at staying off the street
Waves on your forehead is wild 😂😂
❤
Nah I'm good
Does that all count as one?
Who came up with this bum ass workout 😂
💚💚💚
You guys are not strong in you all weaknesses more video on the more heavy on then the more heavy you are the one that you're going to lose I'm skinny and strong I don't need to be big and huge and muscles and all that b******* the more big you are the more slow you are you can try to punch me guess what it ain't going to work because you'd be too slow because you have all that weight on you but you don't need and you will lose that fight you could be the biggest guy strongest guy but the thing is is that you're too heavy yeah you can keep  building your muscles but it won't do anything for you say about muscles it's actually about the mindset it's actually is about the brain not the muscle you idiots 😤 the bigger you are the p**** you are you're wasting your time you're not going to have those muscles forever now guys look like you're having trouble that's because you're overweight and all that muscle is holding you down 👇 cuz I'm skinny but I'm fast and belt I don't have problems but don't push ups easy for me because I don't have that much weight like these idiots do so if it was the biggest guy strongest you lose because you're all that weight is holding you down how long is the two guys are slow yeah baby boy you got all that way but guess what you will lose a fight because the more heavy you are the more it's going to take a lot of trouble to put somebody down and also to you'll be really tired all I got to do is get you tired and then 💥🤯
🔥🔥
How Many Reps?
This that yard work some yall might not know bout💪🏿💯
Push up touch ya feet cha cha real smooth to the left

This what I want my man to be doing when he with the guys 😂❤❤❤ love this.
The instructor was smooth AF.  Like he wasn't even working out at all! 😮
Is his demonstration does that count as one or is each time he does a push-up and does something else? Is that count as one?
😍🥰🥰
i tried this and dislocated my shoulder back to my back spine cracking and piercing my lungs. it's a nice exercise actually   -greetings from heaven
now do pull-ups with the 45 around your waist hit me up afterwards

I love big black oily men😍
Put a Kendrick song on and it links up
Dope
Ha. This is death in less than 30 minutes slow and gruesome.
Ol boy out there doing that shit in a Shiesty mask is diabolical work.
Telling me you’ve been inside with out telling me
Reminds me of when I went to PRISON lmao
FYI you guys aren’t locked up
Instead of calling it Mike Tyson just say P diddy
Turning prison into money 😂👍
Those should be called man eaters
Those are real men push ups😊
Must be nice to weight 150 pounds doung this.
Not even fair they born like this lol
Shoulders knees and toes
Is there a rich person out there reading this who can change my life through a PayPal transaction?
Dang
Why do Mike Tyson like that for?😂😂😂
I can imagine Terry Crews saying "that's 1..."
One white gut is wild.
People are just making things up now a days 😂
Should be a song “I push up 🗣 touch ya shoulder 🕺”
I did ONE! Them joints ain’t no joke.
👑ish!!! Homies up front, lime green shoes and next to him,  BODIED the sequence!!💯🔥🔥🔥✨️

Real man work out 💪
20 push ups per one body squat lol
That’s the nicest looking prison I’ve ever seen
This is gonna be a process right here but I’m ddfinently down for the challenge. I want to see if I can get 15 and go from there I’m definently gonna do this a few times a week
Why is it a Mike Tyson?
Doing this every night
It’s great but like it’s just extra fatigue for no reason, of course idk what their goals are though so I can’t judge
I’m tryna get some work in find role models
😮‍💨 choo choo
And that’s why they all look like skin and bones. So much cardio they didn’t have time to do an actual workout.
This is solid 💯
Hella sus! Bro nem need to space out! Buddy got a face full of booty hole didn’t he??!😂😂
Dem some bad mofos right there😅
If I could do one full one I’d be happy
I remember when I played flag football we had this old man trainer come and train us each weekend. At first we thought ahh this gonna be a cake walk. FVCK NO😅! Buddy made us run the field and drop every 10 yard line for a different exercise and when you got to the end zone you had to sprint back to the other end and start over. I kinda miss him he kept me in beast mode ❤
These all the diiferent variations we did when i was locked up
Just say you wanna kill me. Damn
You can get some of this too camera man. 😂😂😂
That 1
I would forget halfway through what movement I’m supposed to do 😂

Mike tyson push ups are ridiculous. He use to put his feet up on the wall and do them.
I just started this routine I can only do 30 at a time I got a long way to go but I got this!! Awesome video
This is motivating! Great work gents!
in movies about American prison they do that too
Doing so much is unnecessary.
I would’ve forgot everything and just started repping them out😂
Damn...ummm..push up touch me!!!!
One of them skipped a step

God dang it! Power Kings ❤❤❤🎉🎉
Mad sus on the Tyson
🔥🔥🔥🔥
add the ear bite and this is the lazt workout you'll ever need
Stealing this shit
“…Mike Tyson…”💯
It's these type of workouts that build body strength and cardio. I was able to run a 7 minute mile without even training running because of these movements.
Bro there’s no way anyone remembers that exact sequence and then actually does it wtf
Ohhhhhh man My Body hurt just looking at this lol yall doing the dag Ole Thang 👏🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾
The sound is just 🤤🤌🏾
I’m a girl, from “touch your shoulders” :  ok, “touch your knees” : if you want… “touch your…” why do you want to kill me !??
Damn, this guy inspires people in his whole community to workout
There’s many methods and few principles, any push-up will do as long as you’re consistent
I wanna see more of this type of thing in EVERY DAMN CITY IN AMERICA!! Rep em up son!!
Keep the grind up man 👍
Sssshhhhhhiiiiiddddd
So that's what jail looks like
Yo I was betting on who was going to do it first and I chose the right dude let's go. I want an imaginary word what about y'all
150 is insane💀
Why?😂
So one of those examples equals 150 push ups!! lol 😳
This is beautiful. Adding this to my workout
Ima have to do 1 of those a day for a month just to do 2 of those back to back
💯💯💯💯
He did all that while talking, wth? 💪
Ahh the good ole Jail house routine.
Thats ONE.. 149 LEFT
"Thats one"
I haven’t done anything like that since the rec yard. That will kill your chest and shoulders. Throw some burpees in and you’re dead.
Nice motivation! I'm out of shape. I'm vomiting immediately after this. Smh
Interesting........ I'm going to add this
Money
I wanna join in...wya
I will try that!
😮
I'm gonna try it
What state yard yall boys in lol ?
I was doing inch worms today and just that alone is a killer 🥴

Whole body in flames I just tried this shit and did two reps and my body is fuckn screamin 😂😂😂
😮 I'm saving this work out even tho its for men. I need something different
Damn 2 of those n im done n i aint that weak either
Completely unnecessary if you’re not a professional athlete lmao calm down buddy
very gimmicky id rather just do regular controlled pushups for chest and other pushups variations for shoulders and squats for legs
what shoes is the instructor wearing???
Thought this was a verse
Filthy 🦍
Damn, do it 10 times and that’s 100 push-ups plus the lil extra movements
That can't be one!
Is that just 1 pushup?
Good work and intentions, just gotta slow it down and do it right like the demo.
Imagine after all that he say "ard that's one."
Crazy work💯
I know niggas is itchy asf after this 😂
The ptsd is real
Squat…skip it
And thats ONE!!
🙏🏽💪🏽🙏🏽
how many of those do they do?
This the type of practice that keeps you healthy and functional well into old age.
Prison workout in the streets 😂
My brother as a fitness specialist what's all that about it looks nice but what is it developing
The Mike Tyson formation is just completely unnecessary 😂😂
😮
Interesting
All those men have some amazing bodies 🥰
I couldn’t do ONE rep. That’s advanced. 😂
Nice
Love it
why is it mostly brothers
Group therapy 💪
Guy needs to eat some food.

Why? I honestly believe that people do this shit and make up bs like this to do just want attention
🫀🔥
Listen to that! Get you some!

This workout ain’t no bihhh!

Dayum this is tough!
You can change!! You don't have to practice for prison!!!

Now that is straight beast… Combining all that into one mother of a movement…
YUM.
MY TOEY TOUUUUUUUUCH!!!!!!
Thats making meatal that looks harsh in that weather
Me: Push up, face plant....I'll get there.
I love seeing more communities of brotherhood being formed ♥️🥰 You dont have to be alone 🤍 Find a group or make a group and thrive together ✨

Imagine me taking calisthenics routines from someone I’m physically stronger and bigger than …make it make sense
I would recommend adding some leg workouts during the intervals in some way. Can’t forget about the legs.
Imagine he said "one".
The grunts 🔥🔥

Exercising is not easy but worth it
I’m tired just from watching this
Dude in the beginning make it look so eazy
Wooooooow
How many reps do you suggest??
Not explosive enough for my taste  Building muscles is fine but I need power
This is called the Khaos Pushup the one in the beginning created it he is a boxer from PG County and one of my good homies

Head shoulders knees and toes ahh routine💀
❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊
I used to work out with a hefty black dude in the penitentiary. He would cut arm holes and a head hole in a trash bag and wear it under his shirt out to the yard, trying to lose weight. Anyway, He liked to play me in ping pong because I gave him a good game. Competitive. He would always say, "You good rec, Al,you good rec." You done some time you know what he means. So I say to you,good rec gentleman, good rec..
True military workout right there 💪🏾🔥🔥👍🏾
If you're looking for something even more difficult for challenging yourself with pushups or any workout, I strongly strongly suggest studying isometrics. What you're doing is called isotonics which consists of concentric and eccentric extensions of muscles. However isometrics are different because there is no extension of the muscle. As a example rather then doing 120 pushups, try to do 1 pushup for 3 minutes. Meaning from the start position you set a timer for 3 minutes to start or 2 depending how strong you are. If you can go down and back up but make it take 2 minutes for 1 push up your gains will be insane. This is the most anime protagonist workout possible for humans. Good luck and if you have questions feel free to ask.   Isometrics are the key.
The nice thing is that you could do this anywhere.
Absolutely Not…But looks good to watch 🤣🤣🤣
Good work guys
😳
You lost me after shoulder touch
Thank U I'm trying  this workout
Nawh, that's good money forreal
"Can my kids please use the playground now?"
Yard work yard work 😂
And that was 1
Why tf it called the Mike Tyson
Are my obliques supposed to be in concert with my shoulders for how much pain?
This is so stupid and unnecessary. Just do normal pushups
Dude your not in prison anymore go to a gym  rejoin society
Hey man, y'all training for the uniform?
Strong powerful king 👑
Masked mediator
Amazing
150 reps?  that’s 1500 pushups
So many cheating lol
I could see myself in a video with ALLUM at once 😏
Bro made it look effortless
Do DEEZ!
My coach would be like that's 1. You gotta do 50 before you leave.
Look like we prepping for the war. I’m on it too.
That’s 1
Only does 😮 1% leg workouts
We watching this while eating😭
getting ready for them cotton fields
I can do the crawl out but the rest of them I'm still working on😂😂
10 reps of that is 150. I get it.
now thats work boy❗️

I’m coming out to the park to run with the dawgs
Ima call these the full body blast
😮
This the shii Goggins does in his sleep. 😭. I’m in though 💪🏽
I could probably force myself to get through one of these but I’d be incapacitated for a good 30 minutes after ngl
My ADHD ahh would forget the moment he stopped..
It would be even better if you did more squats, so like 5 or 10 instead of 1 this way you arms and shoulders will get a few seconds of rest as well
I would like to start this but I'm confused and I've watched the video three times
EURROOO…. TRAININGGGGG
Why can’t I run into people like this at the park 😻😻😻
Bout to give this a try
That ia too.kuch
Does this make you round shoulders or does it help with the back rear drafts or sides ?
I don’t think I can do this in one whole set
This is actually fire 🔥 adding this in
I do lots of push up workouts and this is awesome. I'm so glad you  shared this.
I wish I can get it in with you boys
Where are the cottons?
That’s about the ratio to leg work them calisthenics only guys do…do a few more squats….example air squat followed by another ATG squat high jump ,than another one high to high knee …pistol right ,left…than do another round of those push-ups …..If you have any cardio left….if you pull it off you’ll actually get more push-ups in and be way better conditioned with some leg work in
Whats up with the 1 squad in the workout 😅
Did I see Pastor PJ on the front right?! #shoes&food 😂😂❤❤
Y’all are home now. We have gyms out here. 😂
I gotta remember this once I get more strength back in my shoulder I broke both in total 5 places plus fractured in n3ck back an 3 broken ribs
I’m doing this part of my boxing workout
Dumb

If I do these I'll literally become a super hero looking ninja
I couldn't do any of that 😂
Best prison routine ?)
Looks like a great baseball pitchers workout
That’s good money
About legs??
All of that for nothing,  but to tire yourself out and fucks up your bones and joints by the time you get older.  Great
This is tough for sure but im too stupid to remember all of that in a row LOL
Boy I’ll give u 3 of those and I’m tapping out, lol
Bro thank you for actually breakin it down
Who else did this after watching?
Nice but how do they do legs
All you’re doing is cardio at this point lil bro
How to stay small 101
*does two push ups and rolls over* I did it ☺️🎉
Wait 150 of them? Y’all on a different level 🤣
“And that’s one rep.”
Nah this is no joke im stealing this one, best workout ive seen in a minute
Doing 1 squat in between is crazy you can at least do 10 squats
I crawl out, push up, touch my shoulders but not everything else. ADDED! Preciate it!
So much testosterone and grunting in the same video.... both amusing and disturbing at the same time😅....
Every white girls fantasy in one sitting
All these pushups to be built like that
I had to change to porn when my mom came into the room it was easier to explain.
“…and that’s one!”
Good lord🎉
Is some honey left for the bees?
How tf I’m supposed to remember that “routine” lmfao I’m working out, not doing a tic tok routine..
Getting into boxing I know doing this will get me there
What is one push up like this the whole thing or each time you do a push up?
I cant even do 1 push up 🎉
That’s 1 homie
That was 1 rep????
I got fit watching this
This is precisely what needs to occur in EVERY community and neighborhood across the nation. We must galvanize ourselves in order to save ourselves. We have clearly seen where that unforgiving path self-destructive behavior leads us. Our responsibility must be towards generating a new and rigid narrative. Remembering that yesterday's price isn't today's price. {thank you, Fat Joe} 😊👌🏾🤝🏾💪🏾🙏🏾 #let'sgo #wegotmotionbabyboi
😍
When I was 16 I started lifting weights.  I was raised by neglectful morons, so I was always looking for attention.  I wanted to be “huge”.  I did ok, but squatting and lifting if hundreds of pounds ruined my ability to move.  Constantly pushing my body too far.    I regret thinking this type of workout was pointless.  I’d be 10000000% healthier today in my 50s.
💀☠️
I like THAT 4SHO gonna be at it❤
150? Fuck I’m in ok shape and even I’d tap out by 15 max
Don't tell that's only 1 rep😳
Push up touch the sun push up touch the moon push Mike Tyson push up Michael Jordan push up now shut up!! Lol
I can't even do one push up 😂
buto
I’m about to starting do this routine 🔥🔥🔥 #goodmoney fr
Those Mike Tysons will stop you dead in your workout if you can't bounce back 😂😂, leave you sitting there like Spiderman.
I don’t take advice from people who in worst shape then me lol
That's easy for mfkas that weigh 120
Hand wrist pain 😊
Ouuuuch (by watching this)
And thats one rep 🤣 damn every thing must hurt after that
Definitely not the best push up form for muscle growth👎🏼
push-up head shoulders knees and toes
Where the white people at ? 😊😁
You literally don't have to do all that. Military has been doing regular push-ups and situps since forever. Overexertion at best
Man i fucked my collar bone up so bad. Pushups hurt now 😅
Beastie .....
Leg day when?
Brutal set of exercises. Do 5 reps per day of this good stuff and you'll wake up Mr. Jacked in 2 months with all those hot beautiful black and white babes crawling at your feet, if you dont eat and drink dumb shits.
This is absolutely no joke! Painful as hell. I think I hurt my shoulder bad doing this 😩
Only reason he’s the best at doing it he’s only like 10 pounds 😂😂😂
I'm practicing it here in my room in Düsseldorf, Germany. Thank you guys
This workout is an EVIL  invention 🔥👊🏾💥😎👀🤣🤣🤣

I need to hop on that so I can stop being fat
bro’s tendons have muscles. 🤓

This is the prison yard time?
To All the naysayers... 20-30 years from now these young men will still look the same!!! From my humble experiences of military service and use of the P90-X routines I'm now 57 and people swear I just turned 40 with a grey beared!!!

Anybody else ever do the Mike Tyson squat card game?
Wait I’m confused how does it equal 150
I cant even do one of those too well.😮😢😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Gonna check this out tomorrow
I kinda inch worn but couldn't touch my shoulder SMH
Where is this?  Jail??
Garden gloves bruh😭
Nice and everything but, this is truly non sense. To make strength, to improve your endurance, to shred your body.. this is a complete waste of time in both calisthenics and weight training
Love the positive energy in air❤
Idk how I feel about my coach calling my baby boy
Needs these ones on the field
I’d forget halfway through
I love the positive energy this is what we all need exercise and motivation equals healthy life style
I’m happy my man khaos getting some light. 2.2 m ppl really like that 🦾😂

CORE CORE CORE 💯💯💯
If your work out doesn’t have a chance of killing you are you really wired out? 😂😂😂

For what?
His exercises keep u lean even if you're a heavyweight,so if you're looking to gain weight,something with less repetition would be more suitable for u.
Great work fellas, subscribed.
After this he going gardening….
That crazy work
Physical activities are a must also maintaining a good diet leads to a perfect physique
Diddy just do a Mike Tyson!!?
All this fancy shit does nothing

Thing about these workouts is, this dude makes it look so smooth, easy and effortless. But in reality, it's sooo damn hard.  And to think how long and hard he had to work to make it look that smooth, easy and effortless. Damn.
I dont think anything could suck worse than burpees . . .  Then this video came up

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m fuccin wit it 💪🏾💪🏾😤😤 tough
Slower
Nah, this my new challenge at the gym with my guys. Love it, definitely not easy at all.
Its harder workouts on the yard in the joint but that will get you right
Definitely gonna try this hell ya
And that was 1 rep???😢
“That’s one”😂😂😂
I’m doing these TODAY
This is awesome. I’m inspired
BULLSHIT 😂😂😂😂😂
This that yard work! 🔥🔥🔥🔥💪💪💪💪
I'll be sitting on the sidelines applauding them saying.. "good job fellas now let's go to Burger King!" 🤣

Or you could do deadlifts and get way bigger and stronger
Warrior mode activated😂😂💪🏽💯💯
I can do it but you gotta write that list down for me. I can’t remember all of that.🤣
Do this if you wanna be a skinny fuck lol. You’ll be shredded but you’re gonna be skinny shredded like the dude demonstrating. If you want size train like Mike Mentzer and ignore the rest of the garbage
lmaooo after all dat thas ONE PUSH UP!!! nah issa joke imma try this shi for a week and see the results
Mann.. getting up off the ground is hard enough for me 😂
After 4 reps you gonna 💯 look like Terry Crews
1 Like = 1 Set of this
Respect
He made that look way too easy
Im ganna add this exercise to my arsenal
As a black person if we can get this many black men to become doctors lawyers and scientists. That would really be impressive
❤❤❤❤
Sheesh
Got them  boyz looking like the business  the definition of crazy work
What do you mean by 150?!
Soooo this is one rep? And how many reps are we doing?
Dang, I cant even do 1 pushup
Now this is fire
Full body workout
Huh Uh
Gonna do this!
At age 60, can’t wait to add this into my workout.  Right now I do nothing but lift weights with a little bit of cardio.  This got me motivated.
The way bro was doing the teaching... smh looked like he coulda did that 1 handed
Gay
Nuff love from the UK bro!  Brothers doing positive things.    You can compete and gain muscle ,release testosterone in exercise not on the dam streets and on the innocent.
Ok black men❤❤❤
Look like a bunch of hot frogs
🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
👏👏👏👏👏
Man this is fucking dope one love
Respect!💪🏽💪🏽

BEAUTIFUL THANG MY GOD BROTHER

Does this make you big? I would make  and start a routine of this
Get ready for the civil war.
Good money indeed 👌
Jail workouts
💪
How hard is it to push up 90 pounds??? Not very
I think the only dude doing legit pushups here was the instructor. Buncha half reps.
Who’s taking fitness advice from someone that malnourished lmao. Get that boy a cheeseburger
He made it look easy
The first guy did that so smooth everyone else was just trying to get it done lol
Great routine
If you do these every day for about a 3-6 months you’ll be right! Probably even sooner
Imma start doing this 🔥
Did one set feeling like I’ve worked out for an hour 😂
Who’s gunna carry the boats
Onana was ready to fuck up again 😂🤣🤣 how is he still in the premier league
Everytime I thought the exercise was over , He added more
All that for nothing.
Dude out there with a ski mask on is Wild! 😅😂
Jailhouse ass routine😂. Naw this will get you right though
We need more of these huddles. We need the chunky bros to join to. “Workout Sunday”.
That's nothing so many people including myself as an active mma fighter does stuff like this more intense
Am i the only one that got tired just looking at it
I need a group of Homies that work out like that so that it could keep me dedicated and in motion
For people that’s under 250
15 sets of this is 150 🔥 very much double if determined.
Pushup, Mike Tyson.
Love the energy
This is so impressive
👀😍💪🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
“alright that’s ONE!!”
Did anyone else hear him say push-up touch your meat?
The way the instructor is demostrating it you may think it's that easy
😀👍
“Push up! Touch ya meat…”
good jail
It’s a dance routine will they remember 😂
After 5 my work out is done for the year
I can do a calm 2 maybe 3 sets of that 😅
I like this it’s hard i only did 2 sets and I’m burning but I am committed to do one of these sets a day. Thank you for sharing. 🙌💥💥💥
Was that 1 rep 😢
Great workout.. ❤
Mike Tyson?
THAT'S GOOD MONEY!!!
I'm adding it 💯💪🏾
my muscles would start popping like you cut a rubber band ball
Bruh, just join the military already and go be a drill sergeant 😢
🙆🏾‍♂️🎯🔥🔥🔥
I thought he was gonna say “and that’s one push-up. Do this 149 more times”
Does this routine burns calories?
Eating Good
W
My favorite workout is high rep navy seal burpees. Either 3 pump or 5 pump. This looks like something I’ll try today 💯🤘🏼🔥
UMD baby!!!! Go Terps!

I'm proud to see them put in ground work.
That's Diddy not Mike Tyson 😂😂😂
Nigga das dat shii I did in prison
All the neighborhoods should look like this! Love it
Jail House workouts
After all that he said "1" haha
YARD WORK ALWAYS GOOD WORK!
And thats one...m
Why’s bro wearing those gloves
Just go a to a real hc gym unles ur a in a prison. Always better results
Would a pushup be everytime you do a pushup, or is it one pushup after completeing the whole process.
Movement!!!
Guys are so lucky they don’t have 10 pound breast on their chest with them down per push-up
That look like it hurts gonna give it a try
💪🏽🔥🔥🔥
I’m doing everything except for that Mike Tyson backshot
💪🏽💪🏽
lol bro getting money next put weight world champion 🥊
If this doesn’t Jack you up nothing will 😳
I'm gonna be doing that 💯
Going on holiday soon will incorporate this into my routine
Look like some damn work
That move would be called the Mike Tyson. Throwing it back on a invisible pole is crazy😂
I need a chair lemonade stand with lots of ice! I want to be helpful!.........
Is for like sport or just fitness training
❤
1 week of that and you be a real ninja
For those reading this, just lift weights normally. Don't be silly
😂🤣
That’s a proper routine.
I do 360 a day and still cant do this !🤦🏾‍♂️
Good work I gotta get on this
Eas
LOVE TO SEE THESE BLACK KINGS WORKING OUT NOT STANDING AROUND THE BLOCK SMOKING WEED BLACK MEN WE GOT TO STAY IN SHAPE FOR THE WAR!
Yes that's  good  but we need more fighting skills
Youll never get stronger doing this type of stuff
That's 1 rep 😂😂😅
Good shit bro, used to do these in adseg
BURPEE’S just tweaked a bit regular old style is way better ..
Damn after 30 I'm dead lol
I wish I could this guys but looks like intense 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
if you do it nice and slow, it will even hit harder.
That’s not mike Tyson. I call that child support
Now that's what you call tough money!!!
Wowzers 💪🏾
gardening gloves 😅😂😂
gloves 😂😂😂
Meanwhile on the plantation 😂
Nigga building an army
Who ever came up with this is wicked!
But how many?
Add a jump at the end of squat and on the way down fall back in to the crawl out position
The fact I actually did it with him💀
Al those guys need tot train there legs 😂😂😂
Bro definitely doesn't condition his legs like this
there all shouting work  but no ones at actual work
Adding this to my full body workout
I just found a new technique to do pushups and it's much more effective than normal pushups or one legged pushups I can feel it in my shoulders and triceps. I ended up doing it much slower than usual but I hope I can improve with consistency as a female. Thank you
Rhabdomyliosis anyone?
Simple and effective, but not easy
wow tbats a lot
Easy when u weight is under 100lbs
👌
The focus should really be on the legs
Just in case other people with the memory of a goldfish, would like to add it to their notes aswell.  Shoulder tap Knee tap Foot tap Swing toe tap MIKE TYSON Crawl up Squat
Dope ❤
It seems rude even on 2 cycles, burning is healing
I shall try this… I usually do 10 push-ups every 30 seconds for an hour
Burn some calories with this one ☝️
You can barely even do 10 normal push ups, gather here 👇🏽👇🏽👇🏽😂
That would be an achievement for me to do 1 perfectly
Maaan I want to be fit and healthy again 😢
the way they just implemented one singular squat in the entirety of the workout.. i love it
I always like the 11 push ups 1squat method. Now, I can say I never skip leg day.
You will see me do this in a gym near you 😂
Great work bois! Keep on pushing! Many stop when they feel the burn. But true character is born  in the fire;  you feel the burn yet still keep on working through the flames. Love 💕🖤 to you'll my brothers
Thug shaker behind the scenes
Mike Tyson came out of no where☠️
Good to see young brothers who are actually in a pack athletic and not all doped up as frail as a twig.  💪🏿 Respect
Mike Tyson?
Adding a jumping Jack at the end would be great
dude has a balclava on in the back💀💀💀
Better take care of those joints! They dry out and hurt when you get old😂
🫡
I used to do those in high school except for I didn't touch my shoulder or the touching my knees either. I was 183 lb and I wore extra large shirt. When I came back to school for football season
Monkeys
Prison. Imagine the stench
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮 ummm ok 💪👏🦉❤
This reminds me of army boot camp. Good times. The drills fucked us up any chance they got for as long as they felt like it. Felt highly illegal but man nothing likesome pushups to get the shoulders crying. Hadnt seen this version of push ups so ima have to smoke myself to no end using these lmao
The hard part is going up to stand upright before squating
BPB0GER6WP
Prison workouts. 😂 this is what you get when you have  very little space but want to be in shape.
"That's one" Terry Crews😂😂😂
That is a good routine.  Kudos!
That’s all you see when I in da feds, and it’s all motivation💯💪🏾! Never had a physique until I went to the feds, when u see everyone on da compound damn near ripped up it make you want to as well. Free da guy🤞🏾🫡💯💪🏾
All that 1 rep? And yall doing 150?🤯
I do this after every machine workout at the gym except for the touch your knee and feet  and sholder part
It may seem easy but give it a try and see, its challenging Very good exercise for strength 🎉 Shoulder on fire!
On that main linen
0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Boutta do this right now💪🏾
Push up, touch your ass crack
Let's go 👊☕
Fat
Not enough squats
Y’all could spread out a bit no need to be ass to face 😂
I would not be able to keep all that shit in my memory.
I was waiting for him to say shoulder again...
Push up touch your 🥒ck😂😂😂
Absolute
Or you could just do like 10 slow rep push-ups.
Very good strength but the guy weighs probably 10 stone, I was that weight when I was 15 and I could do 70 push in just over a minute?   It’s a lot easier that’s all I saying when you don’t weigh anything!  Try bulking up and then doing it.
Yo g i aint a frog
The strength of the connective tissue on these guys to somehow not get overuse injuries doing these type of workouts is incredible
Damn
That is crazy..I love it.
Nasty smh
Do squats
You can also do burpees, works just as well if you don’t want to remember all this
and breath
Must be nice doing push ups all day and getting welfare
Instant pump
10 reps and that’s the whole workout
I'm tired watching this. Kudos to them. Great shape and working hard.
🔥🔥🔥
Damn all that energy for nothing
Program time
Is this in prison?
Meanwhile, I’m eating Doritos watching this on YouTube laying on my couch lol 😂
So are you supposed to do 15 reps of these or 150? I’m gonna try it out

Planet of the Apes

That boy said “that’s 1” 😂
After watching this. 😂 Full body abuse workout push-ups

How the teacher the smallest person out of the group but teaching everyone to get bigger 😂😂😂
They fr get it from the mud
.....aaaand that's one
Lol it's all black guys, because only 1% of white men are built strong enough to do that. Black men are built with perfect bodies.
Mf weigh 60 lbs that makes a huge difference…HARD WORKS THOUGH 🫡
🫡SaLute🔥Respect it💯but wouLd’ve been better if aLL wer in sync motion as 1 as a unit
I got 3 to 5 😅
Dumb

Thank you 🙏
EURO TRAINING!!!! EURO TRAINING!!!!
All I see is prson exercise being legalized
The mike Tyson part made me laugh
Fknn soldier's
Would’ve got up and walked away
Just do head, shoulders, knees and toes and you will be fine.
Watching a bunch of shirt less dudes going “ahhh yeaah, yeah, ughhh” is crazy work 😂😂😂
Man I hate Mike Tyson 😂
If that’s 1 rep 😂😂😂 holy moly
Does a purse come with them gloves?
This is what you do up state so you have less of a chance getting fucked with because when you in shape you have more stamina than the guy that don't work out and mf know that
Watch the full video here > https://youtu.be/IX_lycV3pd4 Follow Khaos on Instagram  https://www.instagram.com/omertakhaos
PT studs look like the dude you see giving the instructions....those big exaggerated muscle dude you see aren't healthy and don't last long....Cali Muscle out here telling yall this! This is true fit physic you watching!!

Push up touch ur knees push up touch your shoulder Push up ching ching  Sold 👴🏻
This is calisthenics?
One or more of these guys have been to prison!
All cardio. No thanks. Rather lift something heavy.
Brother, these “get right” workouts are going to be my bread and butter on the weekends 🙌🏼🙌🏼🫡
You only this 3x a week you'd still be in your best shape.  To get  results fast you have to push the body max. This the only workout you need.
Not enough leg work.  To create real strength,  you must have a strong base.
Oh I need to try this. I hope I don't pass out.
🙈
This is strictly abs and shoulders. Amazing workout for the core.
💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Awesome love this
Not saying it's a bad circuit. However, the smallest guy out there with gardening gloves doesn't sell it. Also, this just screams injury.
I died a little bit during the demonstration 😂
Do that whole circuit 10 times and that is 100 pushup variation madness.
Yall make up anything nowadays. it’s cool the military does it too and it works. I guess
Eatin
Do all that count as one push up
NAHHH THIS GAY
I’m sweating jus watching this shit sheeshhhh
I only did 12 I couldn’t make it to 150 fam
Imma try this
I did not see 150 push ups.

Training for the girlfriends they will never obtain😂😂😂😂😂😂

I wouldn't do it going fast.. it take away from the body length of exercise.
Add a squat jump, after the squat 😁
Gettem boyz
🫡💯✅
I couldn't do this when i was 20 and healthy.
I feel like thats all unnecessary shit. Just do the damn push ups with different widths with your arms.
Dang nice. Gna do this
Bro I'm already tired just watching you do thst
Real motivation I did it
Wait was all that just 1 rep out of 150?
This is stupid Most of the touch this rouch that ar3 useless Yes useless To kids or people who know nothing about fitness they might think it's cool but it's a waste of effort
Damn this separate the men from the boys
I see the got the gardening glovez on.
I gotta watch this like 50 times to remember the whole order. And saving it to favorites.
All that's one rep 😂💪🏾💯
Tf....I forgot the 3rd step
Yard work...

Thanks 😊
Before we was drivin iron, we had calisthenics, can't forget where we came from, we'll at least the few of us that was from that era
Get a full-time job and try to be at a park to do push- ups thats impressive 🎉FJB 🎉
I can do diamond push ups with my wife and son on my back my son loves it
People that usually do that whole routine will stand up and say "one" that kind of push up is no joke
Amen get it black king
And that’s one 😂😂😂
They getting that money frfr! Boys gone be cock strong, literally, if they keep up with this training regiment.
Hold on bro let me get my hot pocket warmed up
What's bro training for ? 😭
Don't say all that counts as 1
My kness gave out just watching the video. 😂 Now, I ache all over, too!! ❤❤
If I was still in the military, this would be one of my correction for improvement education classes.
Heard DMV off back lol
Im currently pushing to hit 300 push up in a day, my goal is 1000 pushups daily but in one go… Glory mode activation 😊
Fuvk yall getting ready for... damn... "push up mike tyson" ? 😢im getting a pump watching this 😂😂😂

Extreme exercise
Six pack?

Medic!! Medic up!!!! Man down, man down!!!! Mayday, mayday!!! I watched him do those pushups and I can't get up!!!😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Beast mode
Doing one set and not even thinking about going into the second is true work ! Good shit bros
Did this back in 2016 when I was in Jail and all the homes were solid asf
That squat in the end though 😂
Got it 👍👍
The Democrats worst nightmare right here.
Love this stack of Push-ups.  Definitely going in on the next workout
😮
I just tried it, ooh wee! Nice challenge though.
Damn
We got head, shoulder, knees and toes: Fitness edition
💀
I been looking for a workout that works not just arms and chest finna do these now
Very athletic and great muscle endurance but easy to do those when you are around 150-170 like him
Dig deep 💪😤
#SPINthaYARD #IYKYK ✊🏾💨💯
All G.  Keep it up
Dam this looks money ima give it a try

Baby boy? Some broke back moutain sessions
Nobody works?
Push up. Touch your balls
That looks hard
Bruh!! 😳
This is the dumbest shit ever.
I gotta start these. 👍🏾🔥👊🏾
Thank you for the new routine ❤❤
One … two
Check game!!! when you up to par a workout should be done with a cadence everybody should be doing it at the same time and if you the person that's leading the pack if you got somebody that slow you guys all should be able to do it in his cadence he should be running the pack.. no one should ever be left behind forever forward push pull strive  we got this s*** all day and all night
Easy
Absolute prison routine 😂😂😂
This is a  great workout my second week doing this work out 💯
I dont like these exercises 😢😢ill rather run 21km🎉
Sooo was that one rep or what
Which jail is that?
I see a lot of chicken legs in the video. Can someone explain to me why I see it there?  THX
🔥 ❤
I think i did 10 of those Mike Tyson's in a row once. My ass and shoulders were on fire for a week. Ain't been back since.
Mike Tyson?
Beast work out
All he missin is the Superman and pike push up 💪🏾
Hard work Easy, Let’s go gang
How many sets
Touch yo Show’da
I really like this one! Between ya channel and my brother RipRight, yall got the best workout routines 💯💯💪🏾
Is this a correctional facility or a bunch of nigga brothers working out?
All that was 1 rep
Just started Muay Thai and about to add in Judo. Definitely going to add this into my workout routine.
I can't even do 5 push ups 😂
Me and my cousin been doing these ! This a jail work out
I have the greatest strength in push ups when I do them every 3 days. Doing push ups every day is more for pussy boys.
Thanks for the info
Man, you crazy.  I’m about to touch that sandwich on this kitchen table😂
How many reps?
I think I found my new push technique forever i don't think I'll ever do a regular push again
And that’s 1 😂
What’s it like having sex with other men?
What table on my side
Np of the squat if it’s only one😂
I’m gonna try this
Man I’m down badddd. I would have tapped out.
Just got up and did a full rep after a bong rip now I’m laying back down 😂😂
Push up. Lay on the ground 😂
Am trying this out
Can’t do it today, but I definitely trying this !! 💯
How many reps and sets y’all start with?
Nigga do all that then be like big it that’s 1
Man would just forget mid way and then pass out😂
That was just one rep😢
What's the point in even doing a squat
Brothers doing something positive,  it's that simple!
This is so stupid. What’s the point? Wouldn’t you rather be able to just do 50 regular push ups but also squat 500 lbs ? Why are people so obsessed with making stupidly long cardiovascular style body weight workouts that serve absolutely no functional purpose. Like how strong are you? Answer not at all. You can just do push ups for ten minutes. Pointless.
I like that, my new work out
This is so good
Dam!!!
What prison is this 😂
Best???? No sir!!! Not for the faint of heart. This some real grown man ish.  Most can’t.
This just for cardio right?
.....1.
Aye health is wealth take care of yo body yo body will take care of you rs
1 set and I’m through 😂😂😂😂😂
where can I find these people ?
Only if... 😂❤
No bullshyt, this is what I thought Basic Training was going to be.    This shyt would have DESTROYED us lmao get that YARD WORK. Men about to become Spartans
Me : stay down cnt push up
15x!!!! Boom
They are practicing that prison workout program.
Yea this burns real good
Good to see fit young men.  Keep it up!
Sheese
Bro onto something right here I fuks with it 💪🏾
Amazing
Do 150 pushups, then do 150 squats, then do 150 sit ups, then do 150 yards of bear crawls. Same results and way less complicated.
Penitentiary Special for the win!!!!
Kind of a burpee aint it
I like how he included shoulder stretches  throughout the routine.
It woulda been crazy if after that he said and that's 1
Bro, was that last toe touch really necessary? 😂😂
They defiantly earned the food today! 💪🏽
These ladies are extra zesty
Why is he wearing gardening gloves though 😂😂😂😂 ????
Waisting their lifes working out
DAMN!
This workout is a joke and totally impractical 😂
First learned the Mike Tyson workout in jail and that shi ain’t for the faint of heart 😂
Yea i barely got to mike tyson. Im old though.
Inspiration 🔥
Where is this at? Asking for a friend 🤔
How many sets of 10 are they doing ? 15 or 150 ? 150 would be crazy.
Pressure 💯💯
Push up switchy in ya face 😂😂😂

Everyone got they own way of working out why tf ama listen to you 😂
The one push up I will be doing are on drake's song
Take off the gardening gloves 😂
That routine looks fuckin nuts!!!!!!! 🤘🏽
First day training 😩😫🥵🤢🤮
Touch ya neighbor tell em God bless you for ya sit down
That’s what gang members should do if they want to succeed. Can’t have a bunch of out of shape and sluggish folks just smoking away.
Tough
Brother this is tough work out not for the weak
I thought bro was gonna freestyle for a minute that pace and delivery of what he was doing was like a flow , great work 👍
I got 1-2 sets in today. I will be back tomorrow to put in work and knock out 3 sets. One day at a time feel me!? Mike Tyson up!
Thats the impossible Macarena
That prison workout to the max 🫡💪
Keep pushin nigghas
eso si inspira
And these Black women calling us names and being disrespectful. Where are they ?? They don’t do this in NUMBERS, see the Brothers GETTING IT IN. While the sisters go out buy weaves , BBL’s, LASHES, NAILS, basically “BUY A BODY” and the MEN PUTTING IT IN THE WORK, getting it done. Brothers KEEP DOING WHAT YOU DOING , let THEM  say what they want. It’s all about LIFESTYLE ALL ABOUT LIFESTYLE….
Thats very good
Nut sacks every where nice 😂
Tried this before I replied....by the third set, I was done....I'll keep doing them to reach 15 sets
Victim weight
Im not flexible enough for the feet touches. I switched it up a bit. Push up, shoulder touch, push up, knee touch, mike tyson push up, crawl up, squat, rinse and repeat.
Lit 🔥 . I’m getting down
He lost me after push up...
What prison is this?
He did so smooth 😂😂 can’t wait to get to this level
Who let the dogs outside
THIS is what a community looks like
Did 5 of these  wow
1 😂😅
as one with military training these aint no damn pushup !
lol what kills me is that they will do all of those routines and hop up and be like “iight that’s one rep, 10 more to go let’s go!” Like what yo?😂
This is burning 🔥 😓
Doing this routine now love it alternating inchworms with burpies 1 for 1 was having so much fun i forgot counting.
I thought my routine was doing something but damn that’s tough 💪🏿 RESPECT
This makes me proud he leading by example. Now if all can do this and stop killing each other well take over the world in less then 10 yrs
Scrap that!! Jump on another guy’s shoulders and do leg raises and bring up then claves.
Sorry but i aint doing the mike tyson part😂😂
Jesus fu*KI** Christ... That army gonna come . And they come haaard homie
Thats all one rep? 😅 fuck it.. lets get it
Keep it up Guys,i love that motivation.
Oooowwwweeee 🔥
Did he say Mike Tyson? 😂
Peak
Military minded!
Demn! Looks brutal.
I think I'll make this my morning workout.
The slower the harder
Pushup touch your balls.
Where y’all at? I need friends like this
After this you can be rugged
Touch shoulder is absolutely pointless it does nothing in that position
Now this will be my daily routine ❤️✊🏽 💪🏽
Amen NEED THt
WE GETTING READY !!!
They did 150 of these?
I need get back to this form of calisthenics… thank u for the motivation
Im trying to understand the Mike Tyson push up tho.
This jigga doing prison workouts just to get hit with bullets lmaooo
All that to look like a stick no thanks💀
😢😢it works for sho
Too much cardio, i stay with iron
What about leg day?
How many?
Dumb as hell lol
The squat and push up ration doesnt compute to me but that's a great work out
Any idea why black Americans wear ski masks in public in daytime?
That is going to wreck my old shoulders but that is fire!!!  Compound and does not get boring.
Is this the U for Blacked Raw
Dude on the right sat on other dudes head lmao
That’s “HARD”
Very impressive younger days maybe  😂
God make it easy man makes it complicated
This right here is a Klan members nightmare ❤ Good job Kings 👍
Bro sounds like he os from the DMV
If we would’ve have been doing this during basic training yoooo we would’ve turned into universal soldiers at fort jackson😂😂
1. Why Mike Tyson gotta be sticking your ass out tho?   2. This is like the electric slide where I gotta watch everybody else while I'm doing it to remember the next step.   3. What muscles does this routine target?   (Drop your answers in the comments)
Very nice discipline
And that’s 1 😮
Mike Tyson?
Mit 45 kg körpergewicht auch alles kein Problem 😂
Got damn.
The skins yoooh ❤❤❤  damnn wakanda 😊😊.
Why is that one maneuver called Mike Tyson again?🤔
I'm adding this to the routine
Good yard work
So is that 1 set? Or is it 3 of these, break, then another 3?  Looks good but a little confusing
Is this called cross fit? I forget the actual term.
The one white guy 😂
The guy makes does it so smoothly that it looks so easy   Man it kills 😂😂 trust me
I love push ups but you can do all of that but then struggle lifting 135 on the bench press 😂
Good for cardio, not good for muscle growth or strength
Crazy‼️💪🏻
Ladies and gentlemen the spiderman academy
Basically 10 in 1 Times 150
All we need is some books to grow brain muscle now...
Ya but you guys are black and were born naturally jacked up so you would look that way regardless
Need to follow this little routine
This harder than I thought😂
Fark if I weighed 10kgs like you I would do this too
that looks too easy
Bros building an army of super soldiers and I love it👏🏽
Not going lie, took me back to my Army days. I would workout with these guys. Steel sharpens still, also great way to hold yourself accountable
Mike Tyson is crazy 😂😂😂😂
Oh man that 💩 is fireman  joe 🔥  👊🏿🫡❤

This is prison?
Yeah I did all this when I was incarcerated lol
I like that
Yeahhhhh budddyyyyyy
Death burpees
Nice dynamic exercise. Added to routine
What kind of prison is that?😂😂
Bet.
Construction gloves to do push ups in the grass... Ma man go get your gender checked lol
I cant touch my toes so thats over with. Stretching trying to get better at being flexible. Until then i can do the shoulder and the kness and the mike tyson.😂😂😂
❤
Love that variation!!
I got sore by watching this
That’s 1
This is a very amateur route
Honestly society needs men to be fit on the average . Take an hour of my  day to do this from now , can’t make excuses about going to the gym , this requires non
Ole man bout to put this to work.... that's good monnnneèeeyyyy! Ubuntu
Call that the Brooklyn Zoo circuit
Need a group like that in Phoenix, men standing on business
Used to do 100 of these a day in the feds mixed with 100 pull ups. Good routine
Glad to see im not one of the omly. Ones who likes pain ❤
How manny reps and sets ?
He made it look so effortless when for most people it takes a lot more effort
Beasty🔥🔥
Why is dude wearing a sheisty mask while working out 🤣🤣🤷🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
I’ll just stick to the OG pushups to much to remember lol
Reminds me of terry crews workout video “…..that’s one!” Lol
My guy is that considered 1 pushup? This is GOOD MONEY
is that 1 rep?
If you wanna know if the shit work. Look at the ones doing it. None of th3m look stacked
SPARRRTTAAAAAANS WHAT IS YOUR PROFESSION!!!!!
EVERYTHING GOING WELL UNTIL THE ZESTIES POSITION OF THE PUSH UPS. HE CALLED  IT MIKE TYSON ASS UP. DAMM CANNOT TAKE IT OUT YALL NINJA HEADS, THIS ZESTY CRAP.
This is the channel that got me started working out and I've been injured for a couple years and lost all my progress but seeing this makes me want to do what I can. Appreciate it
That roll up look like pressure
What prison is this?
Hell nah!😊
I can't do this shit bruh😢  Need to start from scratch
This hard💪🏾
Wow!!
Push up.. Touch your dick..
Man I'm tired already
I think the framing of the question,  if women in ghana had autonomy they'll be different could have been worded a bit better.    i don't want us to coflate autonomy with traditional women role or behavior.
😮
how the skinniest one the leader?
Level 4 days .   CHIN UP ! CHEST OUT !
Good money
Trying this shit tmw.
Yeah probably not.. how bout just do 150 push ups champions 🫡
Dat boy sound push up mike tyson 😂😂😂😂
Beast mode
Just do push ups, squats, dips pull ups and jog.  That’s it.  All the other hamburger dudes be doing is just a waste of time cause they got nothing else to do.
Always the lil 120 pound dude showing out 😂😂😂😂😂
Too many steps 💀 just run, ruck and do normal pushups
That hardcore stuff no doubt
He was making shit up on the spot he didn’t even know what to say next 😂
I'll pass
1 squat for all them push-ups? Y’all are gonna look like them justice league cartoon superheroes. Huge torso and arms with some pencil legs. Try again!!!!
This is bad ass thanks man.
💪💯👍
Letsssssss goooooooooooooo😂😂😂😂😂
They have to be training for the viltrumites coming to earth.
I work out @ the park in the evenings. Ima try this out.
Hard on the yard
This is why white people with never give up their NRA cards 😂
Black man know how to get in shape very good keep it coming. Much respect.
What are all the muscles this would work?
Hahahaha retarded....
Bear crawl 5 yds and you have the 1st part of hell day 😢
All that is one? 😅
I'd rather lift heavy. Sorry
Looking like a prison camp😂
Its easy when they look like sticks and weigh less than 70kg😂😂😂😂😂
This is an hour plus workout
I'm working 💪😞 out tonight 💪😔
But which one of yall have real job and don’t live with your mama
NO GLOVES°~ ? DEGREES°^STAY ON BLACK TARP°
slave workouts
This would destroy anyone.
We in prison
Yep I like the routine, but at my own pace ,not trying to collapse during a workout. 😊😊😊😊
Hmmm is that whole set 1 rep?
Just burning calories and maintaining any muscle you have as long as you're eating the same as you do everyday. Only way to build more muscle will be by eating a lot more than what you currently are eating.
Super tough!
More squats though  "Don't skip leg day"
Ya'll be careful out there Although these workout routines look harmless.....You can tear or rip something if not careful......I ripped tendons off my collarbone that will never heal correctly....Use caution with ANY type of exercise !
Shit! I got this! 💪🏿
They look like a bunch of pit bulls ready for action,
Nigga took the fed work out home
Thats what Im talkin bout!
Tried so many times before and i was never able to touch my should or knee let alone Feet and swing toe touch.. i wonder how long it took them to learn
One leg kick guys 😂 LEGS are the key
This is what they do all day long in prison..... burpeees... spiderman crawls...and  regimens just like this... if it really popped off in here, without our less than lethal options and hand to hand training with response in numbers, we would be in a world of trouble
That toothpick doing this drill vs a heavyweight foing this drill are 2 different workss of difficulty!
Sie haben alle Ihre Steuern gezahlt!
Yeah that's good money right there 💪🏾🤑 salute ... 1 rep is crazy 😭🙆🏾‍♂️💯
💪🏾
Respect
Yes sir. If we stay ready, we don't have to get ready. 😤
I'll be glad when we brothers use that same energy for 5he laws statutes and commandments of the MOST HIGH GOD and do them.
Excellent
Awesome. Great content.
Good use of time 💯 much respect
GOOD JESUS!!! 👍🏿
How many is a set?
They are soo ready for prison
I’m gonna try this today lol
It’s only 10 push-ups folks do those
Feel pumped after doin this
Respect on so many levels I challenge every black man to let’s start doing at least a set of these a day!! Let’s get it
You forgot to touch your balls and a*s.
That’s some good 💴
After all that .. mf say 1
Said the smallest mf out there 😂
To demonstrate that and speak clearly and not be out of breath... very impressive.
One with wrist straps, and the main dude with gloves.
Yeah I couldn't compleat one of those
Crazy
Them Mike Tysons got them boys out here in a bad way 💯
So you do 15 of these?
That's a foot not a feet
Hell yea.   I LEARNED THIS STYLE IN THE MARINE CORPS.✊🏾
Nope
How many?
Bro legit said: push up⬆️ push-up↗️push-up➡️push-up↘️push-up ⬇️push-up ↙️push-up ⬅️push-up ↖️............ THAT'S 1 😢😅
DAWG WERK!!!!
Yeaaaaaaa.
Aiite I’m good for about 3-5 of these
So it's supposed to be one really long set or you take a few seconds break after the squat?
HECK NO!
Wow 😮😮... Props to you gents. But let's be real, these gains are not going to get themselves.
prison time
I did 20 & was good lol and I'm a gym guy
Wack no deep stretching touching shoulder and knee has no value for a stretch
This is part of the reason they fear black man and want us killing eachother. Nuff respect from london my brothers ✊🏾
1 squat for all those push ups. Great upper body workout but lower body lacking
College athletes
Damn I shit on my self 🤢🤢🤢
Is this Rikers Island?
Bro I swear black dudes only know how to train like prison 😂
That’s to much
And remember that if it doesn’t kill you it’ll make you stronger 😊
And again none of this matters cause once that clock stop it stops push up this or that don’t matter
🔥
I'm good for 1 rep. How bout ya'll?? 😅
What’s the Mike Tyson push up?
The final "touch your feet" seems pointless, but otherwise looks kike an incredible workout
Solid work
good upper body sequence but 1 squat?😅
Yall just doin anything. Works tho
These guys crack me up with the garden gloves on
Honestly looks like a bunch of wasted motion just do the damn push up or do a burpee that free style push up shit is for show
Good money!!
Are they in prison? 🙄🤔
Love it!!
Serious WORK
How many of these equal 150 push-ups?
Yo look at them waves buh!!! Got me haten lol 😂 I miss my hair.  O great work out as well.
I tryed it , replacing it for my navy seal 100 push up .
Mike Tyson what?
If white men did this the cops would be there
My brothaz ❤ BLACK POWER🥊🎯
He missed the push up touch your D
I forgot the routine soon as he said it 😂
That's what's up...Get that money
Wow
Workout personified
Jail time makes beast out of you.
I gotta try this😂❤
I m gonna be doing these for the next few months
Shyt 🔥🔥🔥💪🏾👍🏾
Some good shiggidy right here! 💪🏾💪🏾
I rather just hit the gym in the AC
We did this in prison on the daily 4 am after it’s done it’s better than any high you’ll ever feel 💯 day in and day out
Best full body workout ever seen in my life 💪

Good money! 💪🏿

That’s a bad ass workout
Def trying this out
Mann i know them ABs sore ass hell. No loving going on
Fire 🎉
This looks easy but I bet the average man couldn’t do 10 reps of this
This is awesome
Not on the block doing dumb things. Proud to see this
Push up this.. push up that.. PUSH UP MIKE TYSON!!
Definitely going to add this to the routine  Thanks great content 💪💯
Spartans! Bless
🔥🔥🔥
Head...shoulders..knees and toes knees and toes...😂
That is some Euro training.  That was all 1 rep. They got a lot more to go.
Please be ware of your body. I’ve tried plenty of routines coming from this channel, I would say I’m a very fit person. I took some months off, and this video motivated me enough to try it out. I was only able to do 100, I think I might’ve failed at around 70-80. I was so fucked up lmao I never had a routine kill me the way this one did. Absolute killer, one of the hardest routines I’ve tried.
I have bad memory when comes to following to many instructions.
Where can you get a gloves like that? Are they garden gloves?
I would do 1 and be spent
I would forget what I need to touching next and be touching all over
Fucking hell
Say less yo!
Lol. Bullshit
That’s why yall outta shape.
Push up touch ya dick push up touch his dick push up  bust a nut
How can I see more of this
My next routine... definitely!!
Not easy
Making Men of boys SaLuTE , I C U Good Money 💰💰 💯 🔥 🔥 💯
Lets go bros
Alpha male shii
These routines look so simple and easy while youre watching it on youtube😂 Youre like, 150? Ill do 500 of these ez pz
Some of the dumbest shit I ever seen
Yea
This targets full body right ?
Come  on dog  u got this
Nice
🗞️🗞️
Doing this is no joke. Shoulders on flames. This routine straight up kills them
These lads are on a mission 💪🏾
Cash money 🤑💰💪💯
The guy teaching is little.  I don’t take advice from people smaller than me.
It’s good fasho!
Idk what these young bulls do but it looks like football but whatever it is dude gone have them dominating tf out of there opponents (pause for u weirdos) with no one even close to them in competition or to their athleticism after doing these mf's for working out & conditioning. FACTS! 💪🏾
Damn! This is unanimously the ultimate Burpee style push I've ever seen in my life, even vs the prison burpees! Dudes a legend for this. I gotta about 6 months to maybe even a year of pushups & regular burpees before I'm back in shape enough that I can pull off even 10 straight of these mf's here! Hat's off to my guy for getting these young bulls together & all the way right with these mad Krazy unanimously ultimate version of burpees! SALUTE 🫡
Pfffffff crazyyyyyy but I will try it😢 salute👊🏿
Osado
Added to the list 💪🏾
I’ll try it out
