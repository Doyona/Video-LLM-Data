leafs need carl brewer playing defence for the leafs
the game was a wipe out
Clark Nancy Harris Mary Brown Jeffrey
Garcia Matthew Rodriguez William Harris Carol
Marlie minute sucks...hopefully, it doesn't return next year and the Leafs aren't the lifeblood of the league LMAO at best they're the joke of the league, but not the lifeblood lol.  3:06 No Steve you got that number wrong, there were 550 fans in attendance when Toronto blew a 3-1 series lead against Montreal
14:32 lol
Hat Guy: Should I.. Steve: *LEAVE!!!* Hat Guy: Okay!   Tone set not even one second in LMAO
Idk why Leafs fans act so indignant when they lose to Buffalo, like it's so shoking. Sure the Sabres may have struggled for years, but throughout those struggles they got plenty of wins & some spectacular ones against the Leafs. Not to mention historically the Sabres lead the all time seties, by a comfortable margin. The Sabres have historically sent the Leafs home with Ls.
Mrs. Dangle was pregnant for this game too.
Me.. *waiting for the next video* “fricking BRAAAAAAD!”
Safe travels back to Canuckistan...the Leafs rarely win in Buffalo. More wasted money and gas by Leafs fans. 1967!!!
Buffalo sabers fan
Somebody please tell Steve that my Buffalo Sabres haven't made THE PLAYOFFS since 2011. 12 years and counting. And we Sabre fans don't get THIS crazy! 😂😂😆😆
Bonkers McNutts is my cat’s name
3:31 THE MOON
You know, if man landed on the moon, why have we never gone back??? Food for thought.
This guy is certifiable
CON-tri-bute..............uh......no.
This guy needs meds and yall watch it.
I'm a Sabres fan but I love your channel. You're funny as hell 😂😂
Steve, maybe you should start cheering for Brad. This Maple Leaf thing is not doing your health any good.
Are they ( leaffans) blaming samsonov? Lolllllll lolllll lollllllll blame the 44millions 4x core shit clowns who just play for stats points instead of winning a championship
Love my Buffalo Sabres …. Hate the inconsistency 😅  We win against the best teams in the league … and lose against the worst …. 🤦🏼‍♂️  Still…. GO SABRES!!
This is still the best hockey reaction channel on the web :) Cheers from Colorado Steve.
Its just one game dude! Try to be an habs fan these days
I’m a canadian maple leafs fan and love watching this guy. Too much cocacola 🤣🤣
From someone who isnt a leafs fan and kinda finds it funny seeing them loose. I love when steve gets fired up. True passion right here.
My therapist said I should personify my intrusive thoughts so I can speak to them and tell them to go away like they’re an unwanted visitor, and I think “Bonkers McNuts” is the name I’m going to give them 👍
First game this season I turned off half way through 😢
If it makes you feel better, I came to this vid after the recent 4-1 win against the blue jackets. :p
oohhhhhh and fk usa
fk pro hockey team loses 9 ----3-------play the marlies
Toskala. You need Vesa Toskala.
omg------its the loafs
Leafs just don’t get it and never have other then the clod fletcher era. You don’t have a goalie you have nothing. You have a good goalie anyone has a chance almost
Yep..."contenders" get smashed for 9 goals...don't they?
Hes severally butt hurt.
Just to be clear : the leafs don't have the biggest fan base in the league. They don't even have the biggest fan base in Canada. They do, however, have the biggest in the TMA.
The first of many to come. How despairingly wonderful and how hopefully dreadful.
Been a Sabres fan since day 1. I don't have much faith in them but all the hope in the world... however I'll let what they do to us Sabres fans every year go when they do this to the Leafs. Not because I hate the Leafs but love the recap videos when this happens.
It's even funnier at 2× speed.
Dude needs to grow up. It’s just sports.
I’m just here to say Ha! Suck it
Unfortunately I was at this game 😢Steve I feel your anger and frustration
Goalies have to earn their right to play games. Samsonoff hasn't done that. He doesn't deserve to play. The leafs shouldn't throw away their shot at winning the division so Samsonoff can (and will) play subpar hockey for the rest of the season.  He's not turning his season around.  Even if he did, and Leafs go into the playoffs with Woll and Samsonoff, that is not a winning combination. One goalie is terrible, and one is great but is also so fragile that he can't play a full season.
I misunderstood you saying the Leafs haven't won 3 playoff series cumulatively in the last quarter century, but here's a fun fact, the Toronto Maple Leafs have never won 3 series in the same playoffs
18th on trending 😂
Steve.... at the mid point of the second period in this game against the Blue Jackets. The Leafs lead but it looks like they are discombobulated between ever other shift. The performance should be an active awareness of on ice interest, awareness, and interest. The game is fast and it's hard to play. The Leafs almost look like they might actually be.... team defensively minded. That's a key point in winning consistently; team defense.   The Leafs just don't deliver a consistent team effort.
You'll stop being a fan once you realize you are the franchise people come to get money and have no obligation to win anything.Ty Domi knew they would loose the game he didn't care his son scored he knew by how the team is and franchise goes.
Can you imagine if the Leafs were consistently good? These vids would be so boring. If anything, the Leafs' true value is providing us endless entertainment on AND off the ice.   But goddamn, I miss my Dang-Its  Edit: Why does my guy say "KAHN-tribute" like that?
God hates the Leafs. It's time to become goat worshippers or something, maybe we'll have more chance with the goats ...
LOVE Leaf fans!!!!! Don't here from this guy when they're winning, but as soon as they get crushed ( which happens to every team in every league in the world), they have to be put  on suicide watch. LOVE 'EM.
why not give 	Petruzzelli a try? can't be worse than Sammy and he's only a year younger than Woll
Leafs fans “are the lifeblood of this entire league despite the fact that they haven’t won a Stanley Cup, they haven’t even been to a final, since 2 years before man landed on the moooon” 🌙   Best part of the video 😂
The high pitched squeeling.  All I could think of was Deliverance.
Steve The LA Kings has 3 goalies making together 3.5 million.
The Laffs are burning up the best years of their best players....you can already see a BAD ending on the way!
Ai. I'm here a bit late. The leafs are going to kill Steve at this rate.
Somehow this felt relatively calm after a spanking like that.  What a brutal loss.  Let's see if they can own it and push forward.
be
shit happens Dude , not like something that is impossible to happen !  every team has bad games and horrible games ! anyway why ppl going on about it lol , i'm sure at the end of the day the leafs will me in the playoffs
I attribute the pure randomness of hockey due to the league ruining the sport. As a result you will see one team get beat 9-4 one day and win 9-3 the next. The game is too soft, too wide open and it feels like watching a practice scrimmage half the time. Hockey for sure isn't what it used to be.
0:06 to 0:15 is the best part
#13 on Trending, that is all
Always enjoy a good Leaf ass-kicking.
I feel your pain, Steve. Sometimes, it feels like the Leafs are a bunch of rich kids just playing for fun with no commitment.  But that can't be right.
What happened to Domi?  He seemed to be highly touted as a prospect?
I’d be more forgiving of this loss if it wasn’t so predictable and they haven’t been doing stuff like this for the better part of a decade
Man, I wish Sammy was better. He has so much potential. I feel ya, on this one, leafs fans. I'm just happy my capitals got Captain Mustache
Two days after my team loses big to Columbus with fans chanting fire Donny… Steve makes me feel empathy for the leafs fan base…
Had there ever been a team that's  had 9 scored against them, then went out and scored 9 the next game?! Only the Sabres 🙃
😂😂😂😂
dont worry Toronto, they will end the drought..a cup is coming..2067 is your year !! 👍🦬
You know it's gonna be good when Dangle interrupts the intro to start his rant early.
🤷🏻‍♂️, maybe get defence.
Thanks Toronto fans for contributing to the US economy! Love ya
When the Leafs do exactly what the Capitals didn't want to by giving Samsonov a 3+ million dollar contract  Caps fans "yup. Told ya."
When you run into a team that gave up 9 goals at home & got ripped by the fans & the media I am not surprised the Sabres busted out & scored 9 goals.
Lmao almost 100k views in less than 48 hours
LET'S GO BUFFALO!!
Here we go, my FIRST LFR this season
Toronto vs. Carolina... David Ayres... Vesa Toskala... 😂😘
Get Korpisalo
This is so funny,go the nucks lol
A new coach seems relevant.
This meltdown is going to need a Jomboy breakdown!
Yeah well...  wish i was surprised... truly do....
Take comfort in Nylander smirking in the post interview
The Leafs will always be the Leafs and disappoint..
Cap hell looks fun
All this talk of "you're paying $3.5 to Samsonov, so he has to play." Sorry, but that's essentially the sunk-cost fallacy (and even then, it's not a fully sunk cost if you want to make a transaction). With that logic, even if Woll was healthy, you'd be playing Samsonov because he makes more. Better put Reaves back in too instead of McMann cause he makes more.  No, you play the players that currently give you the best chance to win games.
You know it's bad when the moon landing is invoked
As a rangers fan ik how it’s like to lose to that team. I empathize with you
Bro... Its just a loss to Buffalo. Relax
$100 USD for 3rd row from the top, left home (Markham) at 3 pm, got home at midnight. 9 hours round trip, $200 USD plus gas + food for the single worst night of sporting event I have ever witnessed live. Flipping embarrassing. Absolutely embarrassing.
Leafs never learn The solution is never all offence. Crap D crap goalies. Never going far and I LOVE IT
Peaks and valleys man…mostly valleys though.   Sincerely a humble Toronto Maple Leafs fan.
Laff Nation:  "We want Buffalo"  *Loses 9-3
in all fairness, BUF season ticket holders are able to recoup the money they spent thanks to TOR fans.  The true sadness is that those Toronto fans, trip included, SPEND LESS MONEY THAN AT A HOME GAME.  Also, as a Sabres fan, I say this from the bottom of my bottom feeding heart: Go Leafs.  Go...
Unhinged, no jump cut LFR’s are consistently your most interesting, authentic & passion laden LFR’s.
Steve you make an excellent point ..... why has man not landed on the moon again since 1969?
It's almost as if the Leafs are basically as good as the Sabres. Weird huh? Hahahahaha
Have another donut
This is all on the coach. He's not a leader. Queefe is not a leader of men! Queefe insists on keeping a loser like tavares on the PP! Did anyone see tavares skate yesterday? No? Neither did anyone else. He's useless and clueless!
Congratulations, Steve.
Boring repetitive junk
So as a goalie who’s played up to a decent competitive level. I can tell you Sammy is in a really dark place. Like I think most people get that but if you’ve played net before and seen the goals he’s let in it’s like bad. I’m talking very dark. Like the yips is an understatement and I really feel sorry for him.   Also the debate on whether to play or not really comes from the causation of his mental issues. If they’re external, then playing him, won’t fix the problem and just following the story and seeing him play, I think it might be an external issue.
Detroit Red Wings lost to Vancouver 9-5 on Dec. 21, 1983 before beating Toronto 9-2 on Dec. 23, 1983. Almost 40 yrs later the leafs repeating history 😂
I only come here to watch Steve bleed.
My wife and I drove 5.5 hours to watch this one live 😢
This guy just loves to scream and bitch and be negative for views. This guy has 0 athletic ability and loves to scream at other adult men as if hes the coach.
The last time they won the cup was two weeks before I was born in 67 so yeah 56 years ago and on the way to 57. The Leafs have never won three playoff series in a year ever back when they used to win cups it was only two rounds.
Sammy time is up and needs to be moved
Not going to lie, I was excited to see Steve's reaction today haha. What a brutal game!
The first ten seconds is hilarious
Maple Leafs the lifeblood of the league? Lol not likely
I can't believe your head didn't explode after that performance last night. I have said it all year the big problem is in the net with this team no number 1 on this team all of them should be in the AHL.
Sabres usually always beat the maple leafs, they lead all time record against them lol
Did Buffalo use a Zamboni driver! 😂 sorry not sorry  Canes fan here
Steve, I watched the game and it was awful. One of the most awful parts was seeing a staff member of the Sabres showing the "White Power" hand signal at the 16:00 minute mark of the Sportsnet broadcast on live television. He does it while the camera is on Skinner, after he scored. I can send you the video. It is very obvious and concerning.
"honey what you want for Christmas?" "The leafs just got crushed this is going to be my most viewed video of the season, diamond earrings, new car maybe" Steve to his wife, probably.
What happened to the Leafs recently?  Just look at the salaries being tossed around in pro baseball and soccer.
I’d love to see this guys blood pressure lol
Youtube's algorithm is a dark and twisted thing... it hasn't recommended an LFR in, like *months* and then this.  Here's a question: has there been a Maple Leafs goaltender - other than CuJo - that the Leafs haven't totally broken?
LIFE blood of the entire league hahahahahah only a Toronto fan would say that Steve
Steve’s face @ 3:34 😂
It's not surprising that the players quit with what's been going on. Nothing's been changed, so why expect anything to change?
This whole Leaf goalie situation sounds like a Soap Opera‼️
I’m pretty sure the moon landing has been proven fake
Great game Steve! Wooooo!
65 years a leaf fan, and since the 70s Leaf teams have been built to entertain and sell merch. championships are an afterthought.
Don’t even care about Buffalo, but I sure love watching this overreacting turd fake a meltdown for views. Oh yeah, and watching soft Toronto fans cry.
The leafs won their last Stanley cup 2 years before men landed on the moon. ?? You almost killed me.   Lol
Anyone else audibly yell WHAATTT!!!... When that first goal went in...?
you should just enjoy watching your team. you know they ain’t winning.
This is going to be the cumulation of Steve's frustration of the Leafs. The worst game I've seen them play in 5 years. Another team without a winning record walking all over the Leafs. Some serious decisions need to be made with the goaltending & defense
Funniest comment:  Lifeblood of the league.     There's that ignorant stupidity shining through.
your r33t4d exaggerated faces .....  was that you behind the camera in the Senate chambers last week...?
LFR means what?
Some Sabres season ticket holders who sell their tickets to the opposing team's fans can usually get enough to put a down payment on next year's season tickets!! 😆
Nothing funner than a Dangle rant after a Maple Leafs stinker.
I Like Sheldon Keefe but he has to go this  team has Quit on him  Keefe lost the team at  the start of the year
The Leafs record against the bottom teams has been absolutely horrific in the past ten years and I really would like the players to offer an explanation as to why? It is inexcusable.
Was a tough game to watch...Ilya Samsonosaves struggles continue this season...his mojo is M.I.A. right now
I think things such as the five goal comeback against Columbus and the deceptive 7-0 scoreline against Pittsburgh have hidden the many weaknesses on this team. Even in the Penguins game the Leafs did give up 38 shots (even if many were not grade A chances). The Leafs have very rarely looked complete, especially with the entire team's inability to defend, which also includes the forwards who seem to have no idea who to cover in their own end.  The shaky goaltending risks wasting a talented if unorganized and poorly coached team.
1967
Toronto….where good young goalies go to have their careers ruined by crappy systems and even crappier media coverage…like this blog for instance 🤨
will say this abt the canes: pyotr kochetkov has been doing AMAZINGLY recently. we still have a goalie crisis (and a scoring crisis tbh) but PK has been standing on his head every game since raanta was sent down
Love watching Steve when Leafs get thump!
Saying the Leafs are the lifeblood of the league is one of the most Canadian/Commonwealth thing ever.    To most of the fans of the league, I'm sure to a large amount of Canadians, the Leafs are essentially anonymous.    The Leafs filled a building across the river, in a small market.  The Rangers consistently have equal to more support on the road in like 10 buildings.   The Devils, Islanders, Flyers, any game in Florida, Arizona, etc.   But its all what makes goof balls like this very entertaining lolcows.  The complete and utter lack of self awareness.
Hey boss, your hair looks awesome. You've got an actual family and a wonderful dog. Merry Christmas buddy.
Totally disagree with you on Samsonov. Back up at best, or put him down in the AHL
How fucking embarrassing. Anyone who thinks this team is playoff worthy is an idiot. Same shit different pile in Toronto.
Leafs better have no more brain fart games like this or it’s gonna break Steve 🤔😏🙄🤦‍♂️🤪
I hope for nothing but health both physically and mentally for Ilya - having said that, theres as much chance of snow fall in hell as someone claiming Sammy off waivers.
You sound mad.
0:02 the clear change on stuff on the wall made me giggle lol
Leafs are not as good as their record would indicate. Leafs are going to blow it again. Their Tendies are horrinle.
This was the first time in 56 years as a fan that I have turned the game off . Samsonov is his own worse enemy right now and the team has long confidence in him .
I blame goalie coaches....more focus on position than stopping the puck.
Watching 16,000 leaf fans leave keybank center sad and then watching Steve dangles rant 2 hours later has become an annual tradition. As a Sabres fan it makes no sense why the leafs always play like shit in Buffalo. We are atrocious and have been for over a decade
This is what 1967 does to a mf
It’s not a quarter of a century it’s been half a century
Punishment for crushing the penguins and talking that talk
Must be watching wrong video as Steve usually loses his sh*t when Leafs play bad but Steve is calm lol! Steve admire your passion.  Have a Very Merry Christmas
Hey Steve like I said before every hockey teams specially LA Kings fans should have someone like you!!!
it's weird watching Steve freak out and it had nothing to do with the BRUINS lol
It should be NINEALO
I saw an interview with Tuukka Rask and he said before he retired the game had gotten so fast that he was having trouble tracking the puck.Fast forward to today and I have never seen so many teams struggling in the nets—Buffalo,New jersey, Edmonton, Toronto,Carolina—all with goaltending issues. Starting to wonder if goalies have to change their approach to the game because of the increased speed—-just a thought
always love to see ppl cope and seethe from sabres wins lol
Frankly, Sammy might need a sports psychologist. He was mentally unstable with the Caps. Jones needs to be  mentor for Sammy. If none of this works, bring a Russian player to make Sammy feel more comfortable before you wave or involve him as a trade piece.
Dude, please take some acting lessons. Your act is not believable in any way. You come across as legit as the Leafs...Not. More Toronto arrogance...Talking about the Sabres only having 500 fans in the building. I'm very happy to be a member of FTL. PS us real sports fans watch the NFL.
How do you not drop f-bombs the whole video??
Leafs core will never win anything, why do leaf fans still think they will 😂😂😂 I love it tho
At least we don't have to play Columbus, Arizona or Buffalo in the playoffs 🙃
When I saw the score in the app I immediately felt bad for Steve.
Yeah, not such a great game.
I'm afraid we're going to see a man have a stroke someday.
Ew. Leafs or so reliably unreliable
At this point I'm convinced that the Leafs could have any other teams tandem of goalies and just ruin them and their stats. That's how bad that team defence is, especially in high danger situations.  No consistency, no structure, no accountability, no backbone and no chance of fixing it. There's not enough Flex Seal in the universe to patch all the holes on that team defence when they are taking the night off.  You can't win them all but not all losses are equal. There's losing after fighting tooth and nail for the win and then there's giving up and getting humiliated. And it's not the score that's unacceptable, it's the way it came to be.
We are darn close to desperation, too darn close !!
Hey dont laugh at Buffalo.  They made it to the final against the Stars.
NO Samsonov has to has to has to Never play another game for the Leafs again. We can't afford to give away points. We're one bad run of games from being out of the playoffs. It's nuts to play this guy again. He can't stop a beach ball !!
how is this video not called “bonkers mcnutz”?
Sabres fan here. Believe me, I totally understand the frustration. Been there for 10 years, still there, will never make the play-offs, and the Sabres are totally unpredictable...
Pray tell, what does it mean to have the “ YIPS “ 🤔
As a Sabres fan, I knew we were winning this game, but not like that. The Sabres are the most confusing team in the NHL.
I keep saying it and it falls on deaf ears, but I’d trade Matthews for a #1 goalie and an awesome defenseman. They won 7-0 with him the other day, and they had a winning record when he didn’t play last year
I haven’t been this excited to watch an LFR since February 22, 2020… sorry Steve
Sammy needs to be sent down to play and gain his confidence back or something I have no clue what we can do to fix his emotional situation
This was expected, Laughs alway fall short of the Sabres. They dont want Buffalo in the playoffs for all-time head to head history reasons. Laughs just cant play on the same ice as Buffalo and never will 😂
What does LFR stand for?
Do the Leafs just play badly vs Buffalo in general?!
Leaf tears taste so good... Mmmmm
I think these games are bad for both teams. buffalo really think they played well. they played ok. and the leafs just demonstrate how to play without any passion. what are the odds the sabres lose there next game. pretty high I think. both teams are pretty bad playoff hopefuls.
Merry xmas Steve. I needed a leafs game like this.
It's Called Maple Leaf Entertainment for a Reason! LoL!
Let's go BUFF!-A!-LO!  If we could only play the Laffs every game 🤪!!!
“To the Moon, Alice! To the Moon!!!!!!….lol!!
This reminds me of last Saturday when my Pens lost 7-0 to a team they had no business losing to. Weird how that works.
Dude don't rag on  Sabres fans just because the leafs got run out of the building. We got enough problems
Oh dangles, you will forever be my inner voice, lol.  You're why I don't have to punch holes in my walls.
Can the Leafs use the EBUG??!!! David Ayres???😉
Samsonov is heading in the same direction as Campbell in Edmonton. But Campbell was broken in Toronto. Toronto ruins goalies. How many goalies have they had the last 10 years?
can you fine players for that performance?
Yes yes more rage lol leafs suck go Bs
Maybe the Canucks will trade you Casey Desmith for your first round pick in the off-season.
If I go out my front door, & walk 5 minutes, I can see the Sabres rink from the Canadian side of the border. You couldn’t pay me to go see the Leafs play there. I’ve been refusing free tickets for decades.
Until Woll gets back, Jones is the guy who starts. When Woll is back, Jones is the 1B. Sammy? Take a seat, bud. Leafs team defense? What defense, we got a bunch of stats guys who like points on their resume's. Treliving, it's time to change it!
The Joy of winning the leafs version of the stanley cup by beating Dubas didn’t even last a week. Gave up 9 to a team that gave up 9 to CBJ. Yikes.
You know its gonna be a good video when Steve's voice goes up an octave in mid sentence.
If I was Samsonov’s agent I would demand a trade. This team crucifies its goalies. The better their goalie plays the worse they play defence to the point where the score is 9-3. The Leafs need a roster of goalies, a number 1, a number 2 through 10
I honestly hope every parent of the players gives them an earful at Christmas dinner 🍽 😂
At least it wasn’t 10
What about the 2 short handed goals... good grief.  Would Antii Ranta off waivers be a solution? I'm done with Sammy. Jones for me is an ok back up but,  we haven't had a decent number one goalie in a long time... you need one in the playoffs.
"They're a fragile group", what else is there to say? It's not going to change, and neither is the end results.
Almost 100k views in 24 hrs Is insane steve..... bruh 😭😭😭😭
Atleast we didn’t sign Sammy for 5 years at 4 mill per lmao
damn he interupted the intro
As a Habs fan I will say losing in the finals is not very fun
Why does my generation get this soy boy and the last one got Don Cherry?
why is the leafs only option if Sammie and Jones fail, Hildaby?. Could they not turn to Petrizzelli or another young goalie in their system?. Also why is it assumed Hildaby will struggle if he gets called up?. I mean yes that is a possibility but there is also the possibility that he comes up and be lights out and does not relinquish the NHL again. Not saying that will happen but you should not assume that calling him up is a bad thing or it will slow or mess up his development. Yes the goalie situation is crap right now but why not give him a chance. It is not like he could do any worse then Sammie right now.
It was long but warranted.  You rant but you are 100% right
That game was bonkers McNuts
Seeing Sammy hunched over in the tunnel was absolutely heartbreaking. His mental game is shot and it isn't coming back while being shelled by other teams.
18 seconds in and im so happy i don't take hockey THAT seriously 😅 Edit: attacking the fan base of the team that just walloped your team is not a good look
I feel for ya Steve. The Leafs are good but every team struggles at some point through 82 games. Even the Champs get blown out, as no team has a perfect roster construction & eventually gets exposed once or twice. Your team's solid if nothing else, so hang in there bud 👍! Keep the faith & don't stop believing.
Sammy's toaster streudel
Literally every move Brad made in the off-season was a bad move. It's almost like Dubas wasn't the problem. Might be time to question the Shanaplan.
Man, this team. So much potential, but the players don't play for each other. They play for all these individual achievements the hockey press praises them for, but not for each other. And you can't have a winning hockey team over the long term if the players don't play for each other and the team....and the fans. Man. I don't know... Marner for so long has been the glue for and it's clear he's struggling and not playing that role of pulling the team together. Not to put pressure on him. It shouldn't have to always be Marner. He's just as entitled to an off year as any other player. Others should be stepping up. What's Captain T doing about all this? Rielly? Anyway. Enough ranting. This team needs to figure it out and come together as a team...hopefully before they end up with another early playoff exit and another wasted season....
lawl Steve believes in the moon. 😏
The Leafs will win the cup when Canada goes to the moon. Do something Canada, quit sitting around watching Jordan Peterson online
Yeah I definitely clicked this the moment I saw the score
Why are they bad against bad teams?
Steve, I don't know man.... This was such a scatter-f@&k. All I can offer is a commiserating hug. 🫂
The cut to Marlie Minute was fantastic 😂
This is right up there with the 9-2 Nashville game several years ago. Steve, you're gonna be alright. Your team won't. But you'll be just fine buddy.
The always lose against the Sabres,
If you weren’t a hockey fan, you would think the NFL and CFL merged for this matchup to happen based on the score.   It should be clear that the Leafs have a culture problem with how they survey their matchups before game time. Been like this for a few years now, and it’s at the point  where it’s guaranteed money to expect the other team to win.
"Leafs are the lifeblood of this entire league." Now THAT'S the zealot Steve we want to see lmao. Let's go Buffalo!
What happened with Steve’s hat pick and dang-it’s?
I like to poke fun at the leafs as much as the next nonleafs fan. But no humor, no jokes, no sarcasm.. that was one of the saddest performances ive seen in regards to a team just totally checking out in a long ass time.
Kraken fan here. Since my team has only existed for 3 seasons, I don't have much to say about their crash back to Earth. But the team has shown good character despite its own problems with injuries and underperformance from certain players. I was really bummed when Martin Jones left...I feel that letting him walk was the first real mistake the Kraken made as an organization.  Glad that Steve mentioned the Carolina Hurricanes' struggles of late. That seems to be a team that has always shown a lot  of character when things aren't going their way. They give each other support even while holding each other accountable.  They really straightened their backs after Raanta was waived.  Maybe that's the kind of shakeup the Leafs need.
Haven't watched an LFR all year.  This feels like a good one to watch.
No matter how bad we are each year, we will always own Toronto
Don't understand why Timmins got singled out when it felt like the sabres weren't forced to dump-in at all and had easy entrys no matter which D were on the ice. Even with that in mind though i will say i don't get how mccabe-brodie is a thing after last years playoffs
Hockey is a weird sport.
They quit on us agreed. I hate to say it but now I have given up on them. What a waste of my time as it was gone 2am here in the uk 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 where I watched them completely embarrass themselves. That’s it, I’m done no more for me!
William Nylander being a +-0 is kind of impressive. Not to mention 3 d men only being -1
Oh ya not missing this one as a leafs hater
It's the same old thing... Like Shorsey says... The boys don't hate to lose.  By the way... Marlies SMASHED Providence "BOSTON AHL", 7-3 for the second time in less than a week.  Kinder gentler Leafs are killing me... need some serious grit on the team... Clifford? He can't be any worse than Reeves!
Arizona won again, 🎉
Matthews is wasting his career with the Laughs
Guys gota trade for markstrom at the deadline
LETS GO SABRESSSSSSSS
How many times have we watched the core 5 not be able to carry this team ? Matthews was the only player who showed up. Domi    Matthews    Jarnkrok  Bertuzi   Nylander    Marner   Robertson   Tavares   Knies  The Leafs d core is the softest in the League and I can't remember ever watching a soft d team win the Stanley Cup.
Last few games for Blue jackets, Leafs and Sabres is like the rules of rock, paper, scissors..  Jackets beats Leafs. Sabres beats Leafs. Jackets beats Sabres. Leafs beats... no one!!  LOLOLOLOL
Horrible goaltending last night! Sammy sucks. Jones wasn’t better.
Hey Steve even the habs made a final noob Leafs bahaha🎉 merry Christmas steve
"A team that has not been to the final since 2 years before man went to the moon" 🤣🤣🤣☠️☠️☠️🤣🤣🤣
So Max Domi scored? He was a MINUS 4! Conor Timmins was a MINUS 4! How can Boston have not 1, but TWO Vezina contenders between the pipes, yet Toronto can't  find anyone who is even mediocre? Also, can someone teach Nick how to pronounce "contribute?"
Should've made them hitchhike home.
When the Leafs lose we all win.
...man lannnded onnnn the moooooon!😂
I listened to the game till it was 4 2, turned it off and just followed it. Now it's for 4 3. Started listening a couple minutes later after 5 3 thinking they could comeback only to have buffalo score within 5 seconds of tuning in, turned it off again. Came back later one more time thinking it would be 6 4 or 6 5, nope. 9 3. I laughed in disgust, turned the game off for good and that was that. Embarrassing
I don’t understand why the leafs haven’t hired you yet.
Why is this a surprise, in the past 8 games with Sabres the Leafs have lost 6
“The Leafs have not been to a Stanley Cup Final since two years before man landed on the moon” Fun(?) fact: The last time Toronto made it to the Final, interracial marriage was still illegal in about half the US. Literally a month before Loving v Virginia.
In the interests of being fair... expecting Samsonov to be 'the guy', after years of watching him try and fail to win the starting job in Washington over Vitek Vanacek, after his dumb off-the-ice shit... honestly ask yourselves, Leafs fans, did you really think putting on blue and white would transform him into a different guy? I know he's your guy, $3.5 mil, etc., but... this is not a good goaltender. Just... he just isn't. Being angry at him for laying a stinker like this? Sure. Being angry that he's been consistently bad? This is what your team bought, you (and they) knew what they were getting themselves into here.
Leafs should give petro a chance
Im a die hard habs fan. But i sincerly want the leafs to win a cup for SD health and wellness.   Merry christmas ya filthy animals. ❤
😂😂😂
Bonkers McNuts, eh
You forgot to say “Where’s the Tylenol?” Steve
Everyone knows the Leafs goaltending and defence is really bad.  There are so many games  left in the season that teams will quit once they get behind.  That said the Leafs' offence will ensure the Leafs will have a marvelous regular season. The Leafs are mistreating Samsonov for no reason.  He needs to go to the minors to fix his head.
Prior to this game I was involved in a minor traffic accident totally fucking up my car, but silly me I still wanted to get home to watch my team…..and this is the steaming turd that I had experience
Did The leaf’s take Samsonov to arbitration? If so did he watch the Leafs’ video presentation package slagging him as a piece of shit garbage goalie at the arbitration hearing… this is a no no for emotionally motivated or sensitive NHLers…. It is well known that players are advised not to watch this or to attend the hearing as the teams just slag and destroy and make the players look bad to try to win their case for a lower contract amount…. Just wondering…. Cause his confidence seems shot…. Thoughts Steve?
As a sabres fan who was there… sammy was awful. U cant compete when goals like tht were going in
Sammy sucks, Jones sucks, bad goalies or bad defense?  Seems to be D is the common denominator here
This is gonna sound a little like heresy but maybe Matthew’s is a “Jonah”…. Sit Matthew’s and see how they play … just once…. Maybe they as a group rely on him too much or defer to him too much….. maybe see if that is a thing…. Jonah I say!
As a Sabres fan, I was waiting for this video to be posted last night. I ended up falling asleep and now I'm on my break, and what a great way to spend it😂
13:43 Although I could SWEAR they used to stop the season from Christmas eve to Jan 1 for the WJC? I have memories of there literally being no NHL hockey during the Christmas break (Dec 24 to Jan 1) but it was replaced by the WJC which is why they did so well ratings wise?
First i am not a Maple Leafs fans !  That said. I would like you to take a pause and do the simple thing : exhale, inhale,exhale, inhale,exhale, inhale in another words breath !.   Are you calm now ! Good !  Yes, the Maple Leafs lost  miserably against the Sabres last night. Nothing was going their way.   When this happened , you put the game on the side  and move on the next game and just hope it don.'t repeat again.  Next game  Saturday December 23, 2023 TOR @ CBJ or CLB (Columbus, Blue Jackers, Ohio, USA)
Contribute……someone teach the kid how to pronounce that word please
Being the Hanson brothers out of retirement they could still out hit the players we got on this team. Most of these guys could go into the corner with a dozen eggs and not break any.
Wage theft for most of that game.
This is my Christmas gift
12:17 Uh Steve no u don't have to play Sammy if it aint working. Look at all the teams that have exp goalies and they arent playing because they cant stop a beach ball. Dallas Edmonton San Jose (ok San Jose is just bad but still)
1000% agree and am hating all the garbage people saying get rid of Sammy and all the negative comments last night/ this morning The team did not play well or really at all in front of him, it was just sad to watch  Bounce back from this and absolutely destroy Columbus to prove all the haters wrong please!
" This team is literally the lifeblood of the league"" .... That's  the problem dude
love how whenever the leafs play stupid this channels at the top ofmy recommandations 🤣
Steve so surprised Toronto lost to Buffalo that he forgot the Sabres waltzed into Toronto and beat the Leafs 6-4 back in November 😉
Can someone just tell me why we didn't pull Jones and put the Zamboni driver in net?.....or Carleton?.....or anyone that can stop a puck?
Thr paramedics are standing by Steve & Iggy is going to take over doing your videos until you get back from the hospital
I knew this would be epic. Thanks steve
5:33 the irony is that even with gas beer tickets its still CHEAPER to go to Buffalo to WATCH THAT GAME then it is to watch in Toronto.
Re Sammy run him or break him but let’s get over this and move on.
That was the first game all season where the Sabres had their top 6 all healthy, same group from last year and the chemistry was noticeable. Aside from getting consistent goaltending, I think the Sabres are only a couple players away from being a serious playoff team. The blue line still feels like it's missing a piece and the bottom 6 could use a new face or two.  Let's go Buffalo!
I bet the CAPS are missing Samsonov - Adam wylde
We need a coach who can hold the team to account.
We need anew coach who can hold his team to account.
Wow Steve I thought the Leafs were cup bound after beating the brakes off the Pens 7-0. Guess the Leafs also suck lmao
After dunking on the Pens and Leafs fans calling us trash, the justice of seeing Buffalo put 9 in the back of the net felt nice. But I'm sure the Leafs will bounce back just fine
Why does he have to diss us sabres fans for not showing up our team hasnt made the playoffs in 13 years and the bills are just as much a disappointment we are in heartbreak over our teams
Dance sad clown dance!
Leafs don’t have a legitimate Captain, Tavares is weak
Not like Levi was very good this game.
Who wants to go  to Dangle' house for New Years and play the fart game?  Please bring your best!❤
I am curious why Shanahan, who as a player never had a moment of quit in him, is so willing to accept the way these guys play. I've been impressed with Toronto many times this season but they always seem to have this type of thing in their game. They get a few goal lead and they quit pushing. They get a few behind and sometimes they just quit. They acted last night like because the score was 7-3 Buffalo would take their foot of the gas and just run the clock out with them. There's a whole culture problem with these guys.
The "...man on the moon "  stanza of this masterpiece at 3:25 had me laugh/crying
Gonzo!
Fact: Leafs suck against the Sabres.  Fact: Leafs will be in the playoffs and Sabres will not
So you still think this team should sell for a third line Center lol didn’t the leafs learn from rhe past 2 times I do agree  they have to play Sammy until the wheels fall off
Sabres have won 7 of the last 10 vs the Leafs. They own them. Simple.
Steves fades always on point, despite the pain. Lookin sharp, bud! 😁
Nine goals. That's so many goals!
Bonkers mcnuts!  So funny
When leafs lose its a good day :)
When are you going to get back to doing Dang-its? I mean maybe there are some copyright issues with the name, but I really miss those videos.
Today’s sponsor…Prozac😂
When the leafs lose 8-0 tomorrow night I'm gonna burn my bozak jersey. No offense Bozak 😅
Soo maybe stay away from NY teams/florida teams in the playoffs
Bad goaltending set the tone and the Leafs clearly gave up after the 5th one. If Woll is going to be out and can't be depended on from a health perspective then they need to at least see who's available. Timmins should be with the Marlies, he can't play D. Also, the bottom 6 needs to be addressed. Robertson isn't an NHLer, get some one who can play with Jarnkrok and move Domi to the wing.
I mean...at least you didn't lose six straight this month, fire your coach, and your players are apathetic about everything...
Nobody hates the Leafs like their fans!   Love your vids Steve!  Stay healthy!
That was 18 minutes long? Wow, it felt like 5 minutes long. Incredible stuff Steve.
I've said it before and I'll say it again. Matthews is not worth the money when you have no defense and goaltending. I knew it was a mistake from the start.
Death, Taxes, and the Leafs losing to the Sabres 9 times out of 10
Who do think sold them the tickets, stupid?!?!?!?!?!  -Steven
they talk about Coaches losing a room, Goalies lose rooms too. Sammy has lost that room. But to Steves point, Campbell found how to get it back, Sammy can too.
Steve....I said it before and I'll say it again.  Sammy is done.  I don't care if it is 3.5 million or 30.5 million, as he can't be in net for the leafs.  Forcing him in the net is going to deflate this team, who already struggles defensively.  Sadly, this team is a Joseph Woll and several good defense men away from being a legitimate contender.  Overlooked is the questionable decision by Keefe to wait until five goals were scored to throw Martin to the dogs.  By that time, the team was deflated and you are putting martin Jones in an impossible spot.  Not good coaching at all, as the first goal was one of the worst professional hockey goals I've ever seen.  Get Sammy off this team, as he isn't worthy of AHL duties.  You can't say he's having a bad month, as he's been horrible all season.  The Capitals knew what they were doing.
That was the worst performance I have seen the leafs play
You are true Leafs fan.
We didn’t deserve an intro today - shut up I have something to say
This guy is an obnoxious, raging, self entitled lunatic. I can't believe the degree with which he ran down the Buffalo fans and their franchise because the dumbass Leafs made a stinker and were embarrassed by the Sabres. Classless.
I feel for Steve's wife and child in all this having him be this passionate about the whole situation.
Time to take down that wall of shame behind you lol
No. No. No.  Samsonov deflated the team 50 secs in. They fought back and take the lead and Samsonov swims around his crease like a drunk seal.  Keefe needs to pull him then and there.  I’m on the side of the players here 100% . goals 1,2,4 & 5 would make any team hang it up.
more play without puck back to defense zone?
Steve should do videos of freaking out ya can send to your ex... LMFAO..classic lfr...one game Steve...one t the next one...trying been a sens fan right now..WE SUCK SO BAD but they trolled you to..your goal song after the ninth goal...they got you guys bad..well played buffalo well played.. i know Sammy sucks but hes having mental health issues you can so see it...be kind leafa fans...its a mental health issue
"...2 YEARS BEFORE MAN LANDED ON THE MOOOOOOON!"
Roam will approve
more defense zone in first period, more neutral zone in second period, more offense zone in third period?
Why doesn't any of the blame go to Sheldon Keefe? From his dumb line changes, to his style of hockey, and does he even teach these guys how to play defense? Maybe change is needed to get these guys motivated and to play with some what consistency.
Dangle I believe you could play net for the Leafs.   You have exceptionally quick arm movements and I am positive you could keep the bleeping pucks out.  I don't know I never thought about this before.  Leafs please sign Dangle to a Giordano type contract and play him Leaf fans will be amazed.  GO DANGLE GO!❤😂❤
Matthews played great...and thats the main thing. The leafs want nothing more but to be built so that Matthews light shine so they can sell merch.  9-3 loss. Whoooo cares? Plus not surprising.  Look at that defence corp. The goalies. How can one be surprised.  However, Matthews is the highest paid player in league history and that's all that matters.
Is it just me but does the leafs play worst with Mathew’s in the line up. Also what is it with the stupid passes. Look at the game they blew out Pittsburg they played straight up hockey no fancy bullshit. Without Mathew’s.
The Leafs already won their "cup" by demolishing the Penguins.  Now it's back go thd leafs we know and love.  Maybe the fans need to be more worried about their team over trying to taunt Dubas.
Back to being the Leafs
This guy honestly needs a shrink. He’s borderline bonkers and needs to be institutionalized. The Leafs are the ultimate choke team and have been for a long time, so Im surprised he actually isnt more accepting of their mediocrity.
Yeah I remember the last time they made it to the Conference Finals, the Sabres Whipped them.
You missed it. The Leafs gave you this stinker intentionally so you'd get to 12 million page views. Thank them!
Maple Leafs are so fun. Like the fans, when everything goes well, it goes really well, and when it sucks, IT SUCKS ASS PROPER. Waiting for the inevitable meltdown at some point of playoffs. PROVE ME WRONG LEAFS, WOULD LIKE TO BE WRONG
The leafs play six of their next 8 against sens, sharks, blue jackets and ducks. How certain are we to talk out of those six games with a .500 record at best? Would really be nice if they found away to just win against teams they should and bank some points
Since men landed on the 🌚 😅😂
"When your goalie can't stop a beach ball." That's hilarious !!
Samsonov Eye of Tiger!😊
BLOW LEAFS BLOW!!!
As a sabres fan,  I thank you all for the ticket sales and the 2 points.  Good luck in the rest of the season!!😊
What is it at Christmas time the Leafs go into a slump? Maybe too much eggnog.
Maybe the Leafs should drop the blue sweaters and wear pink.
Sit Sammy all day... It isn't just this month, he has been in a slump all year... You said they are professionals, he is not NHL caliber this year. I don't care what he did last year. He is a head case and the team knows it. He starts and automatically the team has no confidence. (I am a goalie myself so I usually side on the goalie) but he needs to pull his head out of his 🫏
I think this is my last year watching hockey. Wife is going to leave me if I smash another tv cause of the leafs.
Getting ready for the playoffs already?
How many of those goals were leafy Steve? Also known as Bad Defense. LGR
THE MOON!!!!!!!
Can we get a Steve's Whoopsies or somethin? Miss the dang-its!
I just love it when Steve’s voice hits an octave only his dog can hear.
How bad is your team's goaltending when you actually miss Campbell who in the AHL right now. LOL
He has to has to has to go in the AHL
I'm not a sabres fan. Nor a leafs fan. But as soon as I saw the score i had to come here.
9-3 lol
Failure is the back door to winning
🎉
This is why Keefe won't last the season 😢
Somebody should check on Steve to make sure he didn't have a heart attack
Ohhh but what about Austy Matwos?? Isn’t that the best the laughs have to offer??
This lfr was just bonkers mcnuts
I know it’s crazy. We’re like literally moments away from going out to find the fattest kid in the neighborhood, convincing him that he’ll feel nothing with all that equipment on, and throwing him in.
Put Sammy on waivers once Woll is ready and back, let Jones be the backup
The first 15 seconds of this video made me realize that Steve reminds me of Roger Rabbit.
Played the best game ever! LOL!!
Look at the bright side. On March 19, 1981 the Leafs lost to Buffalo 14-4. I would say last night's game shows significant progress for our beloved Maple Leafs!!!
I don’t believe this is a real fan reaction video
I suggest that the leafs fire keefe and make Steve Dangle the coach, he talks more common hockey sense than Keefe will ever have.
LOL Loafs
On Keefe for letting the team quit
how can you be so happy one day when they win 7-0 a few days ago and then so upset when they lose 9-3 ....  how about seeing that there are days like these .. especially if within a week.   It sucks but ... ..anyway you need to make a video right.
Vintage LFR
This game had Todd Gill written all over it.
Love marlie minute
Ps what happened to king shalgren?
I started this on my phone but had to turn it off. This deserves to be watched at home, on my TV, with my fake fireplace glowing, while I sip Egg Nogg
The leafs defensive play is garbage. With Jones in net, they still gave up another 4 goals. Its their defensive play. It doesn't exist.
The Leafs now have 38 points in 30 games.  You know what other team has 38 points in 30 games? The Washington Capitals.
Colour me surprised that Hurricanes legend David Ayres wasn’t mentioned as a far more plausible option than that kid the Leafs look like they’re going to rush to the NHL way too soon.  Colour me surprised that Steve wasn’t rocking the same colour blue as the Leafs jersey (or asphyxiation!) two minutes into this LFR.  And how in the world does Canada’s version of OSHA not mandate oxygen masks that drop from the ceiling of that room when it detects lack of oxygen due to depressurisation?!?  ;)  Seriously…sucks to see Samsonov getting the Raanta “can’t stop a beach ball and/or defence playing like piles o’ poo” we’ve seen in Carolina since Freddie went down.  We’ll see how the experiment of Kochetkov and ECHL Quinnipiac graduate works out until Freddie supposedly comes back in a month (for how long only the gods know).  Maybe Keefe and the powers that be in Toronto will see that and leave the kid with the Marlies for proper seasoning.  Hope you have a safe and festive season with PLENTY OF OXYGEN!  ;)
What Hat Guy do to you 😢
Couple of questions..  1: can mental weakness/injury be put on ltir? 2 : what's Matt Murrays phone #?
Steve your talking about trying to develop your goalie by playing him who’s already been in the league for years. He’s terrible he’ll always be terrible and you think you can play it out of him ? You think the leafs can win a cup with this guy in net ?
😂 They have not been in a Stanley Cup Final since 2 Years before "MAN LANDED ON THE MOON" 😂 That comment was HILARIOUS!
Christmas came early for sabres fans
Sounds exactly like what you said about the Penguins. Every team has bad games it happens
No doubt the goaltending is in shambles ,as of today BUT you never once mentioned the elephant in that locker room,there 6 pack is abysmal,look no further than the Rangers game,in a tie game,3rd period a simple give and go that started at the Ranger blue line between defensemen led to a Ranger DMan ,who I believe has 1 goal this year taking the puck ,in a straight line , and shoveling it through Marty's legs,nobody touched the kid through 2 zones.... their Defense sucks
Not to pile on the leafs goalies but as I watched that game I really had to wonder if the leafs players are fed up with scoring and immediately getting scored on and are sending a message to Sammy/ management. This season it seems like the leafs give up when Sammy is in net it's almost like they go "we already lost with him starting" still no excuse as dangle said but it really seems it
1. “They’re the life blood of the nhl.” No they aren’t, most leafs fan thing I’ve ever heard. “We are the center of the league”  2. “ fans wasted their time and money going to buffalo.” Get over it.....if you have that mentality why go to the game? Stop charging 260 for one ticket in Toronto and you won’t have to cross borders to see the team live.
Everyone including the capitals except leaf’s fans know Samsonov is awful
Stevie boy I love you. But there’s no way I’m missing this one 🤭 one word. Embarrassing
Totally agree
And the Leafs are supposed to be good  Hehehhehege fire Sheldon Keefe
This team is definitely talented, but their lack of consistency is unbelievable. Why do you start a goalie that is struggling so much. Send him down let him regroup, what happened tonight just made it worse and you probably destroyed two goalies in one game. Sorry but Keefe has got to go, he makes bad lineup decisions all the time. Another example is using Holl last year when everyone knew that was a bad idea.
THIS GON BE GOOD
The lifeblood of the league lol
"If you get the chance to play professional hockey, then play hockey professionally" might your best closing line yet Steve
If the leafs were smart, which they are not.  They would take advantage of the Blues stupidity and fire Keefe(whos sucks) and hire Barube
Habs fan here. Great video Steve, thanks. You failed to mention another Leafs net minder that could be available...44 year old Zamboni driver! (BTW, that video now has had 1.1 million views and 220 thousand LIKES) Only the Leafs could help establish such a record. Cheers from Habs 24
Bargain basement goaltending is AWESOME!!!!! Having an AHL quality defence is the best.  Luckily we have the core four to carry the team and is there any question why this is happening??
*insert shot of John Goodman sitting in bowling alley from The Big Lebowski*  "He's crackin'!"
You've got to think Sheldon Keefe tore an absolute strip off them last night after that game.
Buffalo was just throwing the puck on the net last night, and it was going in.  I will have to disagree with you on Samsonov, Steve; you cannot have this guy starting NHL games right now.
Rumour has it samsonov is still looking for the puck after Dahlin’s goal…
blue jackets are better bud go blue jackets
Slow it down homie, might wanna get your blood pressure checked 😮
4:10 that is what separates a boys team with mens. I saw their body language when sammy let in those stinkers and it doesnt help they do that in front of him. That is why Tampa and Boston are still better teams. Btw i watch you win or lose. Welcome all non leaf fans, please support our dear Steve and bask in our misery! lol
Ohhh is this gonna be another HIGH view video?! If history has taught us any the magic 8 ball points to “Yes!”
Leafs show up like the weather. You never know what you're gonna get.
Thanks for spending your money in Buffalo!!! Bet the QEW was packed with depressed fans last night! 😭🤣
Why are we hanging on to Nolander still ?
Jones should have started...Samsonov is not right in the head at this point, he's seeing the puck as a mini puck...it's all in the head.
Worst loss since 9-2 loss to Nashville?
It’s almost a certainty the Leafs lose to Buffalo when they play in  Buffalo. So weird…
The Toronto Maple Leafs are a PATHETIC franchise 1967
As an old guy that’s played net most of his life, I’d like to give my opinion on what I see wrong with SoSonov.   He can’t find the puck through a screen, his solution is to drop into a butterfly and try to look big, and not move.   Yeah, stay on your feet, and look around stuff.  It may help with getting scored on high also.
Samsonov having to hear that cannon go off every time the Blue Jackets score is probably going to end his career
I'll never forget the time I drove to Buffalo with my 7 year old son. He loved hockey and this was his chance to see his first NHL game live. He was stoked. This was many years ago before any of the current Leafs were on the team. The Leafs lost 5-0 in that game, but they didn't have scoring chance all night. The looked like a AHL team. So my son saw no good plays. There was nothing to cheer about. And after the game we couldn't find our car. Last night reminds me of this bad experience in Buffalo.
The Sabres always beat the Leafs no matter how bad they are.
Look at the positive at least not worse lost against the Sabres 14-4 in 1981
Ha-ha!
I literally refuse to watch the Leafs play the Sabres. I'm glad I didn't watch this game, because it's always the same against them. The Leafs don't beat the Sabres, they just don't. There are two more games against them this season. Just give them the four points and save Leafs fans everywhere the trouble and waste of time of watching them shit the bed against the Sabres.
I feel like the hockey gods are punishing you.
Love your rant, Steve. Also loved the Steve Dangle Wanna-Be's I saw in the lower seats, in Leafs jerseys, positively losing their minds after every Sabre Dagger. What a hoot!
Sabres fan here. As the score went up and up last night so did my anticipation for watching this LFR!! It didn't disappoint, 9-3, 9-3!!!!!!
Send Sami to the farm.  Hope Hildeby is ready.
It kind of puts into perspective how hard rangers fans were on Igor after a few losses this month.
This is a nice sight having been in the building on the 16th watching my penguins get smoked
Every time my Bruins disappoint me, the Leafs find a way to making me smile 😂
That's a dang it
Do you do hat picks anymore?
MOST VIEWED COMING UP
Now you know how we felt losing 9-4 to Columbus a few days ago
Is this the same team that lost to a  zamboni driver?
One last question...how is this a playoff team?
Interestingly, the first ad I saw on this video was for toothpaste. And the first line in the ad was something like, "Are your gums inflamed and bleeding?"  Yes, yes they are. I think it's from gnashing and grinding my teeth while watching hockey games played by a certain team....
As a non leafs fan this is Great!!😂
this game was truly Bonkers McNuts
BTW Jones wouldn't have been claimed
Stay the course and Go Leafs Go!
He’s reacting just like I did after the game
This is gonna be an all timer.
Came here for the review stayed for haircut.
Damn Sabres scored 362 880 goals? That gotta be a record!
Try the Zamboni driver.
HA HA HA! We are the champions!!!   HOORRRAAAYYYYY! Shanahan, when would be our CUP PARADE?
When was the Nashville 9-2 video? 😂😢😂😢
Toronto is a Mentally soft, weak team.
First goal against - samsonov at fault, 2nd goal Benoit, Timmins and Mathews at fault, 3rd Marner, Brodie and Samsonov at fault, 4th Brodie for not blocking the shot and Samsonov for the poor attempt at finding the shot through the screen, 5th Samsonov, 6th Domi and Timmins, 7th Tavares, Jones and Brodie, 8th Kampf, 9th Robertson, Domi, benoit, Timmins, Jones. Based on this sit Timmins, Samsonov, Benoit next game.
I said when they signed him the guy is not good. Watched him as a caps fan. The guy is just like Mrazek
😂
I saw Sabres fans saying that if the Leafs had a real goalie they only score probably 3. I watched the goals back and I probably agree. Whatever Samsonov is going through, he's unplayable. I'd say to give him the Jack Campbell treatment and send him down but I'm not sure that's better given what's in reserve
What a leaf thing to happen
Ask Santa for a "I shoulda stuck to hatpicks and dangits" T-Shirt!
An old friend of mine told me " never bet on toronto sports teams" .
Its just one game.  Samsonov sucks this year and hpefully they cut him loose in the spring
Meltdown done. Going back to watch the rest of The Hockey Guy.
juiciest episode ive seen in a minute. hope you dudes rubbed the salt in while you sat on the peace bridge until 12am lmaooooooo
The Lifeblood of the league....No...yes they make money but the lifeblood of the NHL, Thats a joke....YOU THINK TO MUCH OF THE LEAFS (like for real)
Conn Smythe is rolling in his grave right now. Hopefully those rumblings will shake the floorboards under the Leafs and make them realize that they should show up fully for every game.
You where the same guy talking smack about the Canucks lol. O there going to suck blah blah. There going to be so bad. I think you should be a Vancouver fan from what I see lol. 😂😂😂😂😂
Yup they were sluggish, unthinkingy glum
Sammy was Garbage last night and so was the Leafs Defense EMBARRASSMENT ALL AROUND
😂😂😂😂😂😂
The sky if falling the sky is falling !!!!😂
As a Browns fan, I remember the old days, when the team "played down", and I was the most worried when they played a bad team, because I KNEW they would find a way to make fools of themselves. Thanks Flacco, throw as many picks as you want, just keep getting those touchdowns!
They should start the Marlies against Columbus!
A team of quitters quit. How surprising. I'm shocked.
Yep same old D and G problems. Which of the top 4 is getting traded to solve this?
Steve the first five seconds of this video is evidence of how supremely funny.  I prefer when the Leafs win but you're the best dude.
I told my wife the other night, right after the Leafs lost to the Rangers, that they were going to be in for a fight in Buffalo. And that was only because Buffalo had been embarrassed as well, losing 9-4 at home to the Blue Jackets ! So what happens ? Leafs put up a major stinker, and now they themselves have to play Columbus next. If you think Toronto will bounce back and beat the Blue Jackets, you are sorely mistaken. After Saturday, and going into the Christmas break, Leafs will be on a three game regulation loss losing streak, with no answers on defence, no answers in goal, just a Core Four of highly paid marshmallows who only think in terms of ME ME ME ! And to think, Joseph ( CALL ME ) WAHHHLLLLL isn’t due to return until February ! I have a funny feeling that I will be watching a lot of LFR’s in the near future 😂
Did... Did you forget about 1999? The whole Brett Hull "No Goal" debacle?  I guess I'll give you a pass because it looks like you're going to stroke out here. Do you smell burnt toast?
I do enjoy a Dangle meltdown...  mostly because he is usually not wrong.
Leafs need to sign goalie Bonkers McNutts!
I am a Buffalo fan,  I do occasionally watch you when the win. Word of advice the best way to get over a 9 goal loss is to score 9 goals the next game so thank you. Just a  little reminder of the holiday movement freeze.  I was listening to the Toronto feed and  all the announces could do for the first period is talk about how Buffalo lost 9-4 to CBJ so the irony is not lost there.
We haven’t quit yet this year. Why do the leafs always have one game that erases weeks of decent play instantly? Ugh
sold my tickets for $250 each last night lmao, thanks for the bar money Laffs fans
Toronto needs to start adapting to the pattern. Naturally, guard the opponents best scorers too, but the most important/dangerous guys?  Is there a player who has played for Toronto? Double that guy. A guy playing their very first game in the NHL? Get that guy. A player coming back from an injury? Keep your eyes on him, he's gonna score. And what about a goalie, is it someone who hasn't ever played an NHL game in his life, perhaps coming straight out of the hospital bed with his leg still in cast? Watch that goalie, 'cause that guy is going to score. Maybe a hat-trick, who knows. Also, is the opposing team a bottom-5 team this season? Might just forfeit the game and save everyone's time.
Support my call for giving Steve Dangle a vocal coach.  Cheers 🍺
Lets go buff-a-loooo!!!
Not a bad month. As a Caps fan Sammy was horrible. First 2 mins down 1 or 2 nothing every game with Sammy in net. That is why they let him go for nothing. I laughed at all my friends that were Leafs fans when they picked him up. He is brutal and is not an NHL goaltender. Not the yips he is just bad.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣   MAPLE LEAFS !  😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆  SAMSONOV  😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬  MARTIN JONES  🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵  IN TOTAL  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Steve trying to take shots at the Sabres attendance when Buffalo owns Toronto no matter where, no matter who watches.
As a Leafs fan who resolved not to spend another penny on the Leafs until they do well in the playoffs, it's kind of funny watching Leafs fans throw money at the team, groan when they suck, and then throw money at them next game.
Same old song and dance. Year in, year out. A little hope, followed by a hard dose of reality.
.888 is not .750
They have a goalie David Ayres, I’m tired of this team
I’m starting to think this Leafs team has multiple personality disorder and this was the person that u say afterwards “don’t ever invite them over again” but you know one day there just gonna show up again
Flames could trade you Markstrom, but it would cost you Marner or Nies plus a couple picks
It's Nashville 9-2 all over again... Except with a seemingly good Toronto team on the end of this one
Going to ask the same question everyone asked of the Pens after the 7-0....  Should the Leafs Rebuild and trade Matthews and Marner to a real contender?
Contribute, contribute. Tomato, tomato?
Oilers fans can empathize with how things are going in T.O. at least your last GM was pretty good
Back in back in back in. The leafs give the blueline up so easy its pathetic. McCabe is the only guy who occasionally steps up and hits someone entering the d-zone. Besides Rielly and McCabe any other leafs d-man is expendable.
love a good leafs loss wish the habs had a steve dangle :)
We need a newfoundlander who learned to skate in the bogs....sigh
Even better in 1.5 speed! xD  #gosharts
Eh this was a bit disappointing. Thought Steve would really loose his mind but no 😔
Bonkers McNuts. Yep, Bonkers McNuts.
After the first goal, I’m screaming pull Sammy keefe.
This is hands down the worst Leafs game I've watched in my life. Granted, I live in Norway and don't get to see a lot of games, but still. Yeah, sure, the goalies were awful, but they had zero help, nothing! They were left alone out there.
The parade has been canceled (again) but Is the NHL canceled too?! I mean, the so-called “life blood of the league” just showed their true colors and got the smack down by the Sabres.
nothing like Leafs misery 😊
At least this video will get loads of views
I mean.... at least it wasn't 9-2?  Yeah, that thought didn't help me either....
They had the flu 😂😂😂 so you aren’t calling Covid anymore, 😂😂😂 it’s the same thing , you been lied to
Did we not have a Zamboni driver beat us one time why not bring up a kid from the AHL in a situation like this. It's not like we are asking a highschool kid like a Disney movie to step up to save us. This is an emergency situation where our defense is having a nervous breakdown... desperate times call for desperate measures.
You care more than the Billion Dollar Baby Leafs!!!! Plus It's December.  Hope you get the views
Call up the rookie, have a fight at practice, go to some random bar in Philly and pick up a win song. You’ll be on your way to a cup! 😉
i feel sorry for Leafs  next  opponent.  It will be revengemode.
Another nothing season
Sansonov is alright physically but not mentally at the moment. He needs a sport psychologist
My volume cut off with the video still playing and it's quite entertaining watching Steve going sideways with no volume too
When Steve has a tantrum after the laughs get humiliated, the world wins and enjoys his pain.
Caps fan here, I don’t miss Sammy no offense
Little bit of revisionist history on Campbell, Steve. He came in, was OK, had an outstanding month and then was a sub-900 goalie. He wasn't consistently good
You need help
Leafs don't have any other Russians on the team that could be a problem I'm just saying language Barrier. I heard Joe Bowen talking about it
Couldn't have happened to a better team.  I enjoyed every second.  Then this video topped even that.  Nothing like watching dongle lose his shit.  Would you like some cheese with that wine Steve ?
Mulligone, Mulligtwo, Mulligninethree ...
Leafs cant win in Buffalo. I honestly think it drives the Sabres players seeing their fans in the stands
I only come here for these (and after Leaf-games, win or lose, in the play-offs)
"Contrabute"? Busty one-legged busty woman.
There’s got to me either a lingering injury with Sammy, or him becoming a father has really screwed up his brain.  So maybe a stint with the Marlies could help him
4 goals is a bad night for the goalie. 9 goals from 2 different goalies is a bad night for the team defense
SINCE THE MAN LANDED ON THE MOOOON 😂😂😂
I watched the highlights.   I don't recognize alot of the players on the Leafs.
Just come over from catching up on a 2 weeks previous SDPN video where the lads discuss the Sabres 😂😂😂 beautiful timing!
You think the leafs goaltending is bad? The Oilers would be 8+ games above .500 if they got .900 save percentage every game. On the dot. They can’t get a goalie who can do it for half the games he starts.
This is going to be a fun video.
30k views in the first four hours. People are sickos. I’m one of them too.
👋 Hello, folks who only come watch the bad losses where Steve screams himself hoarse. 👋
Campbell-Samsonov switcheroo??? Harakiri, or best solution possible.
The moment I saw it was a 3-9 loss the memories of Nashville flooded back. Hat Guy was brave to even go that close to Steve after this.
Would be awesome if Colorado could grab Sammy from you guys for cheap. We always need extra goalies.
We own you! THE BUFFALO SABRES OWN THE MAPLE LOAFS. 😂😂😂😂. Regular season, outdoor games, playoffs, pre-season, the sud, maple leafs gardens, tanking, we own you bro ....OWN YOU!!!!😂😂😂😂😂
Buffalo Sabres all time record vs laughs 123-86-18
The worst part is I'm sure there are still gonna be Leafs fans that'll excuse this performance for some reason. Those fans make me wonder if the fanbase actually wants a winner or if the majority of the fanbase is just happy with a team that plays down to competition and gets exposed in round 1 of the playoffs most years.
As a Hurricanes fan, I've been feeling a lot of solidarity with you over how frustrating our favored teams have been this season.  Personally, I think you are giving the 'Canes a little too much credit in your comparison.  Some players haven't really contributed this whole season, and at least one defenseman should have never been signed again after his last time with the team.
battles the yips
It seems Leafs fans are unable to see unhealthy tendency  - almost every player who's shit on the Leafs is great on any other team, yet Leafs fans are blaming everyone but those responsible, no wonder you haven't won a cup for almost 6 decades!
Sammy has been so bad this year he’s given up 4 goals in over 1/2 his games. When you have to score 5+ goals every game he starts it’s exhausting.
I don't think this team is better then last year
Meanwhile... Somewhere in Winnipeg... Brossoit & Hellebuyck are sippin a Timmys steeped teas on their Mansion decks (there has been no snow this year)... I remember a time (not too long ago) when Adam, Steve and Jessie said Bucky would never re sign in Winnipeg... Love it ❤Cheers!
Still better than the Ballard era....
Honestly at least it was Buffalo. I love Buffalo. Go Leafs Go!
Samsonov was gruesome. As a Sabres fan, I was shocked when Greenway’s mild wrister went by him so easily. I doubt he could’ve held a 4-0 lead.  We spoke just like Steve after Tuesday. What I wonder is, would Buffalo have won in convincing fashion tonight (even w/ our actual lineup finally back together) playing anyone else BUT the Leafs (or Boston, another big rival?)   Because I sure as hell ain’t betting good money on Saturday being a barn-burner against the Rangers. When they win just TWO in a row again, and start winning more often than twice a week, then I’ll say okay the bad, bad stretch is over.
This is great for channel views for sure 😅
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. SABRES!  SABRES! SABRES!
Can we get Garmin to sponsor these videos so we can get health monitor as he does the video. I know people watch more when leafs lose but this guy is in shreds after this one.
I love that the leafs find new ways to fall apart. The leafs haven't made the final playoff round  since the first wave of expansion , if it means that they don't wins cup for another 5 to ten years I would be thrilled to see the NHL add another 4 teams to get the NHL upto 36 teams
I went to the Sabres game on tuesday where they got annihilated by the Blue Jackets 9-4… mayhaps the Leafs could complete the cycle when they play the jackets on saturday 🙃
Awesome game looking forward to watching the game repeat
To be fair, 4 of our last 5 wins are the Bruins, G Knights, Rangers and now Leafs 😂 they're giant killer but can lose to anyone
I think Keefe should be fired because starting Samsonov and keeping him in after the first period led the team to quit not on Sammy but on Keefe. Expect more losses until he is gone. This team is done playing for him after this.
The comment section cheering for this might  be sadder than the Leafs performance...
It COULD have been worse...  You could have gotten shutout by David Ayres...
Poor Sammy :,(
They 100% gave up. If they didn’t they may have had a chance to come back. What is with this team and not giving a shit against the bottom teams in the league.
I read a nice quote... To the Leafs...!! You have to train your mind to be stronger than your feelings or else you gone to lose yourself...
I'm just gonna say it: there are way too many selfish players on this team. They're all only concerned with how much money they make, nothing else. Look, Crosby won a Stanley Cup in his 4th NHL season. The core 4 have been together for up to 6 years now? This team should be doing much better, especially in the playoffs but they can't. They're not mentally prepared for this game.
This is just making them look bad especially when they are the talk of town and all of NHL
🤷‍♂️ You could probably pick up jack cambell 🤣
This is ridiculous how you lose to a underdog team that's not even going to the playoffs? Leafs need to stop taking these teams lightly
wow, a goalie problem in Toronto, what year is it?  oh every year.
Same ol leafs
it's alright steve, a 9-3 loss is the same as a 1-0 loss in the standings, just keep holding on, the playoffs aren't til next year
4:54 😂😂😂 yeah we know Carolina can win without a goalie… All they need is a Zamboni driver in net
Trades, trades and trades... Get player's who want to compete and are proud to wear the a Leaf Jersey...
as a sabres fan I loved this video
LFR after a leafs implosion is such a guilty pleasure. But this one is special, an early Christmas present. We normally have to wait until April for such a generous portion of Schadenfreude.
This might be the best christmas ever as a Canucks fan 😌
They started off good in the game until Samsonov let in the first goal a real stinker. Right after that I told my son the pace of the game changed as they have no confidence in Sammy. Starting him gave Buffalo a 5 spot in goal. Anyone in net would be better in net. Good thing Sammy only has a 1 year contract.
What’s the Zamboni driver doing?  Maybe he’s available? 😂
Fire the coach....!! And break-this 4 players too. Samsonov get rid off him too... Tavares, Marner need to go too...
hi mom
Well, if it makes you feel better, the Kings have forgotten how to score.  (11 goals on goaltenders in our last 6 games.  1.83 GPG.  50 shots per game, but shots don't count in the standings, where we've gone 2-3-1.  We beat San Jose and won a shootout in Seattle, and sucked four other times.  Sigh.)
Merry Christmas!
You know steve true fans would come in and put on the leaf  jersey and play to the death for 100k.
Question. What kind of dman or goalie could we get with Nylander’s money. The teams + - would instantly ski rocket 🚀
you sound like miss piggy @ 3:32
Doggo still deserves a treat for being good doggo
Brother.   That's what happens in the NHL when you don't play defense.    I'm not blaming the goalies on this one.   The blame is on the GM for not bringing in defensive players (more snot....give me a break), the coach for not fostering a defensive-minded game, and the skaters for not hustling.
The unbelievable falloff from Sammy this year reminds me of the Manoah situation. Going from a 2.33 and .919 to the abysmal this year.
Views go brrrrrrrrr
Coucou de la Suisse, je ne suis pas là pour chaque vidéo mais celle-là je me la tape c'est sûr!
don't the Leafs always lose down in Buffalo?
Sabres fan here how's it going leafs 😂😂😂
That’s almost the same as the 10-2 loss the Sharks had to the Penguins… How does this feel Leafs fans? You’re supposed to be good though…
Samsonov is the New Jack Cambell, the curse still lingers
Lmao 🤣 what a baby this is why leafs will never be a great playoff Stanley cup team they aren’t a solid team two or three good players never any real goalie sad people still hype leafs lol 😅
Leafs beat Pittsburgh by a touchdown. Leafs lose to Buffalo by two field goals. Welcome to the NFL.  I actually think Toronto would be a good city for a football team. A guy like Dangle would be catatonic by December every season. 82 games? No, there are only 17, and every game is gigantic.   More misery. Frustration amplified. Rage focused in to 4 fewer months and just about 5 times fewer games and every playoff game means elimination.   If the NFL could get in to Toronto’s market, and get them to care, there would be enough woe emitting from that city to conjure some ancient cosmic monster, drawn by bleakness radiating from Earth, that would finally annihilate us all for a snack of suffering….
Its the core 4. Mathiews was out they played like a team.
Samsonov is horrible,  and the D core is just swiss cheese
"THE MOOOOOOOON!" that has to be in next years intro.
Yeah but let’s be real leafs need to win the division. They aren’t beating Florida in the first round.
you love to see it, let the leafiness flow through you
Let put this behind, and look forward next game. Leafs play very well on the road. Tonight just a bad game. Let win next game, and Go Leafs go !!
we literally sell our leaf,canadian, capital, and penguin games to pay for our seasons lol. whats missing 8 games out of 41 to pay for the whole season? you guys pay $400 for nose bleeds
I think Steve needs a doctor on standby when the Leafs get destroyed. His blood pressure must be through the roof
If the leafs turn up on 23rd… could be the best 3 team match up going   CBJ 9-4 Sabres Sabres 9-3 Leafs Leafs 9-2 CBJ ??
What happened?
At least it wasn't against a Zamboni driver
Get a new defensive coach it’s absolutely pathetic
Half the Leafs D are the Marlies Stevo 😂 this team has no system, Keefe is lost. Get a real coach in here!
Well, you said you were 300,000 views away from a milestone before the new year, so the leafs losing 9-3 may help.
That’s a good lookin fresh haircut Steve. Screw you and merry Christmas too
Sammy HAD to be pulled after the goal 5 on 3. At that point Leafs still had a chance. Unfortunate situation for Jones to be put in, yes, but absolutely needed. Keefe needs to pull the trigger sooner on these types of situations.
I come back here everytime the leafs get embarrassed 😂😂😂😂😂
Time to start thinking about trading Nylander before the deadline. Oh ya and sick goalie. Hahhaa love watching Leafs fans melt down.
saw the score had to watch
Yup he said it all, was at the game and it was straight up humiliating
Just like they’ve quit in every playoff they’ve been involved in since 1967!  They’re consistent chronic quitters !
Can't wait for the April videos 🤣🤣
Thank you for reminding me that it’s well past time to drop Samsonov in fantasy.
that's a hot take on Domi. But I agree on Timmins he's just been getting lucky hauling ass to cover up his mistakes
i want to give you a hug, Steve
Merry Christmas Steve!
I'm one of those people that mostly shows up when the Leafs get hit by a train.  I apologize for nothing. :)
Keefe wants to play the goalie with an 880 save percentage . Jones at 930 isn't good enough. Keefe needs to go
Toronto has reinvented the wheel so much it's back to being square.
I’d like to offer a very grumpy welcome back to all visiting bad-weather fans of Steve Dangle
steve likes it when his team loses.. ^^
Good job boys, we see each other on the 26th, 7.30 a.m. on the ice.
Welcome to the Sammy conundrum.  Saw this in Washington with him.
Dark days in durham region
Today hurt…
These wins are all us Sabres fans get so we’re gonna enjoy them. 💙💛
Everyone knew this video was going to be a banger.  Have a great Christmas Steve.
I hate myself for enjoying this man misery that much
Didn’t Campbell have like one monster month and sub-.900 the rest of his Leafs tenure?
if the leafs are the lifeblood of this league, the are the cold-blooded reptile lifeblood because they have no soul.
The only way that game would have been more hilarious is if their Zamboni driver was in net
Honestly the less they're paying a goalie the better they seem to play, at least since Freddi left. It's kinda wild that the Edmonton goalie situation is talked about so much more.
Emil bemstrom
Sammy can’t stop a flippin chicken nugget if it went flying at him 😭
Hey man... fresh haircut is fire.
As soon as you see Steve cut off the intro you know you are in for the rant of a lifetime. Unfortunately he roots for the Leafs, which means that lifetime only lasts for about two years until the team hits a new low.
Watched Tverberg at UConn. Kid is a tool
"You can earn back money, you can't get back time" is such a good line Steve. Our time is by and far the most valuable thing we have to give.
Go Jet's Go
The view count will be high for this one
CANNOT WAIT TO TALK TO MY STUPID GRANDSON TOMORROW LOL LOL LOL I WILL NEVER FORGIVE MY DAUGHTER FOR MARRYING A LEAF FAN BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS LOL BUT AT LEAST I GET A GOOD LAUGH AND CHRISTMAS DINNER WILL BE REALLY GOOD AS THEY SIT AT THE TABLE WITH THEIR HEADS HUNG IN SHAME LOL LOL LOL WHATS THAT 16 GOALS AGAINST IN THE LAST TWO GAMES LOL LOL AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF I KNOW MY WIFE GOT THEM SOME LEAF STUFF FOR THEIR GIFTS AND I GET TO WATCH THEM UNWRAP THEM LOL ROLL ON XMAS DAY I REALLY DO LOVE A GOOD LAUGH AND SLAGGING MATCH AND I THINK NEXT WEEK USHERS IN 2024 WHICH WILL BE THE 70th YEAR WITHOUT A STANLEY CUP LOL GOTTA LOVE IT .
not enough time between games or too much time between games?
Us Habs had "some guy" being our goalie. He was effectively trash that we claimed off waivers because Price was out indefinitely. We put his ass in the hot seat after Jake got injured. He is now Samuel Montembeault, a top-30 goalie league-wide goaltender who's effective in most situations with both good and hang-out-to-dry defense in front of him.  You're right. Play the living hell out of Sammy. He's bad right now, but he's also like 26. In goalie years, thats "some kid." He's "The Guy" for your future, and thats what makes or breaks NHL teams. You guys have some all-star motherfuckers on your team and you need to raise a goalie like the Habs and the Bruins are doing (again.) Yeah, you might not end up with a Roy, Brodeur or Price, but you might just end up with a Fuhr, whos just "The Guy." Habs have Montembeault as "The Guy," just like we had Price, Jaro and Theodore before him.   Pick "The Guy" for the Leafs. Sounds like Ilya "I Don't Give A Fuck" Samsonov is your "The Guy."
wtf? i thought the leafs where finally becoming great this is a bruh
Buffalo: I like ya cut Steve *Smacks the leafs 9-3*
Like a trainwreck. I cant not watch the lfr for this
jack campbell was NOT consistent steve, im sorry. he had 1.5 great months
I have been very busy lately but I always tune into Steve. Especially when they lose. I know, Im sick.😂😂
Love Steves Samsonov plan. Hes gotta go old school and battle his problems for the team.
Hi everybody just here for the next Steve video to go over 750K views ;)
10:23 I’m sorry Steve but you and Adam have literally said on the podcast how Jack Campbell rode a hot November that season into free agency. I understand the anger, but this is complete revisionist history
As a Hurricanes fan I empathize with your goaltending woes.  We're trying to figure out if we're going to ride Kochetkov until Andersen returns in January (maybe?) or if we're about to start Yaniv Perets...who has been playing in the ECHL.  The ECHL. We don't even have a goalie in the AHL we can call up.
LETS GO!!!!
9 goals is objectively funny
3 goals is not bad
Buffalo here, win or lose,  we love you here...
What's worrying, is thos game in a nutshell   They have proven over and over they have superior talent and can snap their fingers, tie up a game at any moment   But like tonight, they just give up. They won't win a cup if faced with any adversity unless it's against the best.   If a west 6 , 7, or 8 seed makes it against us. We'll get swept.   Our only hope is to go through TB, Boston and the Rangers and hope the Wests #1 or #2 seed makes it to he cup.  This team only seems to get up vs the best. 0-4 vs Chicago and Buffalo.  CBJ only gets played hard against because of the playoffs loss.   Sucks being a TO fan sometimes
9 ?
Im a leaf fan but if I was in Vegas I would have bet the farm on Buffalo with Samsonov starting.The rest of the team didn't help though. but it was going to be a 100% sure loss because the team was treating it as a sure win so why not put Samsonov in.And Toronto has been more guilty of this than any other team this year.
So that's 15 to 7!? Against Buffalo? (2 games?)
Where do we see Toronto having good goalie depth??? LOL not for a single second over the past10+ years they have a goalie that's capable of winning a cup.
When there’s no intro, and no sponsor…that’s when you know he’s pissed
The Leafs will never win with the perennial loser John Tavares as their captain. Enjoy celebrating his personal achievements, because that's all he's good for. And for 11 million a year? 😂😂😂😂
People not going to like this comment lol it's only one game  lol middle of season ish but Sammy should be gone I would of let him walk never hade faith in him
This one seemed special so I pulled it up in the theatre 100% worth it
Watching the leafs lose even though I don’t care about hockey gives me Schadenfreuden…that means finding enjoyment in other peoples suffering…yes there is a word for it
this is just what you needed to hit your viewership goal for the year! Hope it works out for ya! Happy Holidays!
Come on man, at least give the Sabres a little bit of cred for bouncing back after having 9 hung on them a couple of days before. They played a great game against the Leafs
I know this is an angry video but watching steve bounce around all I could think about was the fact that he was bouncing on a yoga ball for it
Time to Move to Vancouver man.  Do some Winter meditation and Join a winning Team.  ;)
Genuinely wonder if Steve is truly cares and supports the leafs after how awful and mismanaged this organization has been all his life or if this has just now become a means of making income by continuing to produce content and overreact after every horrendous loss.  Organization continues to hire the wrong people in place to run the show over and over again  Shanahan should have been fired years ago and fans should realize until the top hierarchy is altered this will continue forever
Habs fan here. Goalie stress? Never heard of it.
Steve, I’m here win or lose and I’m not even a Leaf’s fan. I literally went back to rewatch your videos from the beginning after discovering your channel several years ago. That being said…these videos are the most entertaining and I understand why they’re the most watched 😅
The Leafs might’ve actually done it to Steve this time.
The new haircut looks good. High and tight.
Please someone make a Bonkers McNuts T-Shirt
Okay. this is a me thing! But playing: Should I? LEAVE! over and over again is the greatest thing i've found today.
The Leafs management are clueless, since Dubas took over,  they blew it. Gave up the farm with those contracts to the core 4/5 while continually picking up 2nd rate goaltenders and cast offs, Matt Murray Samsonov, Hutchison, etc etc , no team has built a team like the way the Leafs have, and with good reason!!  1-7 in playoff series. The f….ing goaltender is the most important position. This team as it is built is entertaining as heck but they will never go on a playoff run. They don’t have it in them.
I guarantee you shut down this channel and the leaf go on a tare for the next  decade
see you boys again in the spring  when the leafs get eliminated
Bro send Ilya samsanov down to the marlies till he gets his confidence back
Campbell was such a great leaf he won…. 0 playoff series for them 😂😂
Awful defense and even worse goalkeeping( hard to believe)  .not the first time this season . Feel for Steve , and myself and the legions ofLeafs supporters once again betrayed
Awful defense and even worse goalkeeping( hard to believe)  .not the first time this season . Feel for Steve , and myself and the legions ofLeafs supporters once again betrayed
Sammy may stink, but his guys did him no favours. The D constantly letting these guys walk in and never holding the line. 91 ,aka leadfoot , may as well have had popcorn and a comfortable chair. 19, and 89 may as well be the new kerfoots… lots of skate and pretend hits with hardly any execution. This team has more issues than just Sammy.
Nah they are still Make Me Laugh fans they are still buying streamers for the cup parade.
@7:55 the hands are giving “YOU'RE GONNA LOOK AT ME AND YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME THAT I'M WRONG? AM I WRONG? SHE WORE A CROWN AND SHE CAME DOWN IN A BUBBLE, DOUG.” energy
Do you honestly believe the goalies need to be better? It doesnt mater what goalie from any universe plays for the leafs the results always going to be the same ..As a die hard fan WHO  ?  is coaching the greatest maple leaf group of players since 93 .Whoevers protecting the bench should also be let go .Theres a group of players who want change.They will never openly admit that but theres no motivation nor heart.
IM OKAY I SWEAR
Steve what about the top 4 paid players. They were invisible in their own end and why do they not draw more penalties.  Sammy had a serious grade level 4 concussion the type that has ended players hockey careers. Buffalo has won 60 percent of all games in history with Toronto. It's probably close to 70 percent the past 3 years.
9 to 3!!!!!! Bonkers McNuts!!!!
The leafs need someone like jack Campbell. He’s available if you want!
This is the good stuff ! leafs fans tears is nectar of heaven
Now I do not 13:48 know if the season will be paused because of the spike in Covid cases.
Blue jackets > Sabres > Leafs confirmed
LETS GO BUFFALO! cry leafs cry
How’s that happening for Leafs and Knights got both teams suffer this season got stinks.😷
why in the hell does sammy get this start? i knew exactly how the game was going to go based on that decision whatever, he gets the start, but then BOOM on the 3rd shot THAT goes in? pull him right now and save yourself a chance to get into the game. since that first goal, the whole team changed. they went from energy to now, "ok we can't give up another shot" and then turn into turnover machine by trying too hard and making mistakes. playing without an ounce of confidence with who is in net.  you don't pull him after that 1st flub goal on the 3rd shot? fine, you go into 1st intermission 3-2. put jones in, pull him during intermission. NOPE. gotta wait until you're 5 deep to make the decision to pull him. keefe you f'in moron. good luck jones! hope you love being the fall guy!  not sure who lost this game harder. sammy or keefe.
Speachless
dont give nick shit because the marlies are an actual team people take seriously relative to their position
The whole reason I watch these is to hear Steve yell when the leafs lose
This one’s gonna be bad isn’t it…..
Your entire season depends on Joseph Woll.. .if he's injured at playoffs... Leafs are done.
Stop me if you’ve heard this one before…. The Leafs have a stellar fall leading up to Christmas then play just above .500 the rest of the year and disappoint ing the playoffs.  Happened in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and here we go in 2023.
Lol... Miss Joseph Woll yet?  They're going to have a Coronation for him when he returns!!!
I was Disappointed beyond belief tonight   I don't usually turn off a game but when it was 6-3 going into the third I said no the damage is done  I had the score up on my phone in the corner But even then I was frustrated  Maybe we need to call up the AHL fella earlier than we expected
Wow stoping the intro when was the last time that happened?
Imagine telling somebody three months ago that, less than a week before Christmas, Martin Jones is the Leafs' best option in net and Calvin Pickard is winning starts for the Oilers
This is how I felt watching the Leafs get 4 on Shesterkin.
Holy fuck I miss dangits and hatpicks
You are Legend!
This is unacceptable Changes need to be made before Columbus plays us on Saturday
Guess this is a colossal Dang-It.
I saws this score and knew I had to check out SD, and see if his head pops off his shoulders LMAO.
I missed the first five minutes because I was laughing at the intro still.  *Experience leafs hockey.*
Hey, is the Zamboni guy still around.
Dude this is taking years off your life
Tried to watch it. I just can't...
As a Sabres fan I would like to thank the leafs for this Christmas present
Caps fan here…..called the samsonov fail
Life blood of the league yet they haven't won a championship since Nixon was president.
That last segment made me feel better thank you Steve, merry Christmas!
You said the Leafs haven’t won 3 rounds in over 1/4 of a century. Sadly, they’ve never won more than 2 rounds in the playoffs. When the Leafs won in 1967, the playoffs was 2 rounds (4 teams). That is sooo depressing…
Bunker McNut is now a thing.
Marlies minutes needs to go
I took my buddy to his first ever NHL game, and this is how our team returned the favour. I don’t think he’ll ever want to see another Leafs game
Ummmm team meeting? And ummm maybe send sammy or trade himmmm ???
*Caps fan nodding sagely* Welcome to the club. We wanted Sammy to be the unquestioned starter for years and he never could manage it. I thought you guys were lucky you got last year out of him. I felt resigning him was pushing that luck.  Luck may have run out.
my first LFR of the season <3
Matthews was not in the game vs Pittsburgh 7-0 Leafs won. When Matthews returned 2 games lost. 🤔 What's the common denominator? Is Matthews taking too much ice time away from other players and just trying to score? Try last years line. Matthews, Nylander, Marner or Tavares, Nylander, Marner with Matthews on the blue line.  I predict this year is their only chance. Why? Because of the salary cap. I want The 4 core to stay but hope Tavares re-sign at a big discount around 5 million. But if what others are saying, Nylander or Marner must go? That will be the start of the downfall. Then Matthews in two or three years will want to leave for a cup contending team to win a cup. I still don't understand why doesn't the coach switch goalies either after 3 goals or each period? Teams usto do that in the past. A break not to rest but to refocus. Even if a drastic mission is required like switch after 10 minutes of the period if a goal was made.
Well that escalated quickly! As a Sabres fan I have to thank the Leafs for letting us win this game. Season is early, but the Leafs seem to have a good chance at the playoffs while the Sabres look to miss it by a point, again.
3.5M for Shamesonov, sounds like he has Jeff Finger's agent
If I had a nickel for every time this week I saw a sports YouTuber get so angry he interrupted his own intro...
I don’t think Samsonov is fine, he seems hurt. Something is going on, just hope he’s alright in general cuz good lord it would be tough right now in TO
Guys, nobody should be surprised by this. It's the same story every single time they play a bad team. When I check the schedule to see who they were playing and saw it was Buffalo, I knew the Leafs were losing. When they play good teams, they show some effort, and when they play bad teams, they shit the bed. This isn't new. They've been like this for years.
Sometimes I want to end it all as a leafs fan
This is one for the PANTHEON, this is fantastic Steve! You give beutiful words on my similar feelings for this team!
Steve, just so you know ... I watch all the other ones too
No goalie, no cup.
There's a reason why I have not bought a single piece of Leafs merch or memorabilia since 2014. It's the best boycott I have ever done. The Leafs don't give a damn, so neither do I.  I am a Leafs fan. But it's been decades since I said I was a "proud" Leafs fan. Nothing to be proud of.
Yep I was at that game that hurt
The only way out of hell is through it. Well said Steve, all we can do is focus on the next game.
Steve needs a hug
First Freddy was the savior, then he was run out of town. Then Campbell was the savior and he left. Next was Samsonov. Then Woll. The issue isn't limited to goaltending. Leafs defense is atrocious, and has been for close to five Y E A R S.
Tit heads Steve are we or are they 😢
Ouch. LOL!
I'm not one of those sickos that only watch the big losses videos of LFR BUT I admit I have a love for them
Fun fact, the Leaf's have NEVER won 3 rounds in the playoffs.
Great game ,ove it.
Here comes that Nashville rant from a few years back
it's because they saw the results of jfresh's "annoying fanbases" poll and it made them too sad to play well
I gave up on Sammy like 5 games into this season, problem is, so did he.
I knew I would be laughing after the first 5 seconds of this video, I just knew it!
This is the worst I seen them play all season neither goalie could stop a puck and the D core what D I believe they forgot we had a game tonight. I hope Keefe ripped there asses a new one just disgusting
Game aside, bravo Steeve beautifully orchestrated one take / rant.  Cheers
100K VIEWS, HERE WE COME!
Ehhh, didn’t like the ending to this one. No reason to be snarky towards Nick. He didn’t lose the game for you.
We are 123-76-18 against you. You all can shut the fuck up with all your usual dumb ass excuses you all make every game like “the refs helped them” or “they didn’t try because they didn’t really need to” or “it’s the game before Christmas, they just wanted to get home” and your 100% original 12 year drought jokes. In the span of 20 years the Sabres have won multiple playoff series, made it to the semi finals, won the presidents trophy despite not making the playoffs in 12 years. What have the leafs done in the past 20 years you ask? They’ve won 1 series and think they are a dynasty team. The Sabres have won more playoff series than the leafs in the past 15 years despite not making the playoffs in the past 12 years. The reality is, you all act as if you are a dynasty team when you literally just fucking suck. Playing a maximum 4-7 extra games a year isn’t a brag. We own the leafs, we’ve always owned the leafs, and we always will own the leafs.  Also, going to our games in our city solely because of the fact that none you can afford to go to your own home games is not a brag
Craig Berube's available 🤔
You could always cover the Sharks given your new found friend 😉
Ya but we can shutout the Penguins and spank them 7 nothing so
Here we goooooo
Damn you hate to see it. Actually, never mind. You love to see it. Still chanting Dubas?
Samsonov for Pesce? 🤔
So by the distributive theory of math, CBJ beat the Leaf's 18 to 7.
Its going to be okay Mr. Dangle
Is Mackenzie Blackwood available?
Ohhhhhhhh man. As a hate watcher this is so, so, sweet.
WRONG! Sammy is injured right now. He is mentally injured. You don't expect Woll to play because he is injured, physically, right? So, let Sammy go down and get healthy...torturing the guy is not going to work out well for the player or the team. And having him sit on the bench with all the fans/media staring at him is not going to be helpful either. He needs to be sent down to play for much fewer fans in a much less stressful environment and find his game.
Uh oh.  Sad clown video score.  Somebody make popcorn!
I don’t think anyone can go on waivers because of the roster freeze.
They quit on Samsonov Jones and them selves !!! Especially when you see a player like Nick Robertson sit on the bench while the glory hogs suck the life out those who actually play hard every night! Mathews Knies don't care seems to be getting the cold shoulder at times. Saturdays game Janrkroke Domi Knies had something going . As did Kempf Gregor McMann . Yet the glory hounds get away with mailing things in!  Nylander open man Kempf no I will shoot over the net !  Bertuzzi 1 Mississippi 2 Mississippi 3 Mississippi 4 5 6 and choked . Ya Domi has is defensive liability at times but is also playing better . Dubas Shanahan left the cupboards bare , bring in his experience GM that can't make any significant moves that could improve the team he took over because of no move no trade clauses , no draft picks,  and can't or even consider trading future players like Cowan Mitton Knies Woll Jarnkrok Kempf .
Keefe is a moron for starting sammy timmins is a clown  we need a coach and defence man
leafs have 2 goalies @ 86 save percent (or less by now) so...every game should probably be this. this is what happens when you're afraid to trade one of your guys, whom you never win with anyway, for ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh let's say carter hart....who's on an inferior roster with MORE POINTS than the leafs right now.
hahaha  suck it dangle
Next Game is against Columbus .So same thing ? Or get up ?
Merry Christmas SDPN. I'm a Pens fan so at least take solace in the other night. Jessie, Adam, and yourself made the Leafs my 3rd team after the Pens and LA. That Austin guy ain't too bad either.
Lmao
How the hell do the Buffalo Sabres beat the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs but get their earth salted by the Coyotes and Blue Jackets?  This team makes me want to cry. Usually I can say "at least we have the Bills," but...
So the podcast tomorrow is gonna be fun
Hope the drive home was horrible and long for all the Leafs fans! Thanks for packing the building and spending your hard earned dollars to go home sad once again!
money aint shit... no heart.. no drive... All flash!
Did 1st year as a Blue Jay Yusey Kikuchi start in goal??🎉
I went to the Chicago Bulls game tonight against the San Antonio Spurs in Chicago with my dad, brother and somebody else that we knew. We got there an hour before the game When we got to our seats with 50 minutes to game time, the Maple Leafs took a 2-1 lead and then 1 minute and 5 seconds later, the Sabres tied the game, then a few minutes later, the Sabres took a 3-2 lead. At the stadium, there is a screen that shows other scores around the league and from the other sports. Every single time the Maple Leafs and Sabres score came up, The Sabres goal count would go up by one. Then near the end of the Bulls game. It showed that the Sabres won 9-3. The Bulls won 114-95. I have something from the game that will remind me of the game. Also, I am Pacers fan. I just went to the game because we were offered tickets to the game and I love Chicago teams and Indiana teams
It's hilarious watching ppl be surprised when the Leafs show themselves to be a gutless bunch of losers over and over again. But it's ok, the $13m man got a goal and is pretending to be upset that they got dummied by one of the worst teams in the league.
This game has hopefully brought new life to Buffalo.  They’ve underperformed all year (Thompson only has nine goals shockingly).  Our highest goal scorer has 14, and they haven’t won more than two games in a row.  Had we lost and gone five below .500 to 13-18-3, that goes from bad to too much to recover from to make a playoff spot type of bad.  Instead, we showed up and beat a great team.  Hopefully we can repeat our success with the rangers on Saturday as well.
This team is bonker mcnuts
This is what you deserve for being a fan of the leafs
I think the caps knew what they were doing when they dumped Sammy.
Another christmas gift? Yess!!!
Steve…Hans…Bubby…these kind of games, you just flush it. Shake it off. I know they suck to watch, but you can’t stop games like this from happening. That’s vanity. Tomorrow’s a Friday. Buy yourself a fancy coffee and treat yourself. Happy holidays to you and your family 💙👍
someone has to get some tape on Sammy's pads, he's sliding everywhere
If the LFR intro doesn't play entirely it's going to be a good video
Bonkers Mcnuts is amazing lmao. 4:23
Sammy is not good enough
This is one of the videos where I worry that steve is just gonna faint on camera. Honestly, I would. Thanks for doing the work Steve.
I dont agree . Lets jones be the starter sammy had a fluke year. Hes showing why they were smart bot to give him nore than A year
That Marlie Minute was FANTASTIC!!! Thanks Steve!!!!!..hahhahahah..loser
Bonkers McNuts!!!
16 goals against in 2 games , 16 and this is not football! No cup contending team on any planet plays this bad.
I've been on this crazy coaster since 1993 when I found this crazy sport and fell in love with it.  It's still December...should be fine.
LOL! Steve you're going to need to take a two week vacation really soon. This Leafs team is taking years off your life expectancy. It's not worth it. Steve... Is it time to attend Leafs addiction group therapy?  You are the only person who can answer that question Steve.
I switched the game off at 5-3, then decided to check out what was happening in the 3rd, and i see 9, and in that instance, i laughed out loud and shut it back off!
... THE MOOON! LOL that needs to be in the intro along with Sam Bennett is a diver
we need to start calling out Brodie, sure timmins is shit but hes making nothing. Brodie has been garbage all season and gets 5mil. Brodie every game has an assist for the other team
This is my first time this season listening to Steve Dangle Podcast . Tonight if you want to just lay the blame at Samsonov feet well sorry the entire blame can be layed at all their feet . How many times has have they played down to on paper a less talented team and where they are in the standings! Ummmm going on 7 yrs . This was sorry to be expected , winning 7 - 0 against the Penguins was worse thing they could have done . They went on the same run last year then suddenly they went into the ditch... Keefe did his usual thing watched and said did nothing. Tonight would have been a prime opportunity to lay into them, bench the floaters even if meant going with two lines . Marner should have been benched!! Powerplay a minute 30 minute 40 what the hell is going on!!! 😮 Those well played players are not earning their ice time !!  Yet that second PP can be more productive in less 24 !!!😮 Defensively team wide Suck!!!  Own end coverage sucks!!!  Timmins skating in and takes the puck off Domis stick , puck turn overs all over the ice, breakaways , an NHL  hockey game ..
It was definitely the longest night at the year
1st game in years I turned off after 1st period and never turned back on and was gald for it! Great job Keefe you are the worst coach in the NHL. Fire Shanahan please his plan is the reason for this garbage team with no heart and a bunch of cry babies.
Wtf are the leafs right now?
Look at the positive side.  If Dubas were still here, he would have re-signed Samsonov to 8 years at $6M per year.
9-3
So I agree slightly with the take Steve. I agree that Samsonov does need to figure it out because you can't bring a kid up expecting the team to do better just because its a different goalie. However, I disagree with the belief Sammy needs to start. You put Sammy as the backup and Jones starts VS Columbus. Through good or bad play, you hang Jones on whatever egg the team lays - he's there for that. Then you as rigorously and directly as possible challenge each and every skater on the team about what they value in life and if hard work is part of it. The team has played so-so for several games now, winning a couple (or at least getting a point) that maybe they shouldn't have (other than the Pens game). So the team needs to clean up their act and be better and they know it. The focus should be on them doing better first, then bringing Sammy in to start when the team has its shit together. At that point, Sammy needs to play through his shit but the team needs to be confident first, otherwise they will bail on him just like they did tonight.
Look, I know Sammy is playing like butt, but he’s not the one out there turning over pucks and causing odd man rushes and breakaways out there. We have a major issue right now that nobody is talking about, and that’s the fact that our team is so obsessed with offence that we are allowing the opposing teams players behind our lines and giving them the puck. I want you to watch the last few games. How many times did we have one lone defencemen or less dealing with 2 or more opposing players on a rush while the other 4 leafs are nowhere to be found. There is no good excuse why the other teams forwards are behind your D when the play starts going the other way. And it’s a systemic problem. All 3 D lines, and to a lesser extent the 4 forward lines are guilty of poor defensive positioning. Simply adding a good defenceman to the first line isn’t going to fix that problem. It’s a systemic problem that needs to be fixed by the team as a whole.   And your 100% right about Sammy. The only way your going to get through this is to play him and hope he finds his way through. Unfortunately, I don’t think Sheldon Keefe is the kind of guy who will do that.
Samsonov is holding them back, open your eyes. I just started watching hockey. Samsonov is awful
If the Leafs are thinking big, they need to answer the question of whether Sammy is the goalie to take them to the promise land. Leafs need to do everything in their power to give him more confidence. There’s no other options. You paid him 3.5m, you gotta trust that he’ll figure it out. Is Sammy going to be the guy to steal a bunch of playoff games and shut out top teams? I don’t know.
Sammy ruined this game and the leafs quit after the 4th goal. Tough stuff
At least it wasn’t 9-2 or 9-1 just like SAN Jose and Chicago.
Leafs need to give up a nine spot more often. This is making your career. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
As a sicko... I'm here for this. :D
Sammy is not healthy. Sammy's mental health is shot. He needs to go before he pulls a Freddie and straight up quits on us when the struggle becomes too much.
2nd goal: Benoit way outta position, leads to a 2 on 1. Matthews with no effort in tracking back, doesn't dive to get in the way of the goal.  3rd goal: Marner with a brutal giveaway. 4th goal: Brodie should get an assist for that great pass right back to Buffalo  6th goal: Jones hasn't even warmed up and Domi + Timmins let him face a breakaway for his 1st shot 7th goal: Brodie outta position and just glides back. McCabe lets the puck go right by him behind the net and then doesn't stick check anyone in front. JT just stands there too.    Samsonov was crap, but the rest of the team tried to out do him.
Horrible
Steve is hockey’s version of Lewis Black.
Early XMAS present
At some point you have to hold someone accountable for this kind of recurring theme. Who is it though? Like what do you even do or change? Lol boy oh boy
Jones save percentage tonight was worse than Sammy’s lol
Sabres fan here who sat and spoke with a bunch of Leafs fans who couldn’t wait to hear what Steve had to say😂
From A Jet's fan Ha Ha.
Steve you need to find a new hockey team to cheer for before the Leafs kill you and I'm serious.
I feel so lucky I'm part of the largest fanbase Steve's content is so high quality.
I was at a restaurant with friends and this game was playing in the background. We left shortly before 8pm and the score was 2-2 in the first period. I honestly dont know what i was expecting the outcome to be, but this definitely did not creep into mind
As a Canucks fan I love Steve when he’s does these videos when the Leafs lose in the most humiliating way possible 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This will sound awful but mrazek would be an amazing goalie for the leafs right now.
True we don’t want to turn Hildabeast into Sparks (where’s he now? Had a great first game with the Leafs and the next few games they broke him and he was bounced outta the league
So we are all here right now
Steve don't forget the Leafs didn't want to pay Samie $3.5M. What salary did they want to give him was is $2M? I guess that arbitration over value him eh
Sorry bro.....but you should be used to it by now.
BuffaLOW
I was expecting the first LFR where Steve stares blankly into the camera for 18 minutes without saying a word.  Opportunity lost.
Tom Segura taught me that 9 is a lot.
Marlie Minute needs a millennial pause. I'm getting jump scares lmao.
This season's been cooking up some prime Wielicka Salt Mines from Steve.
Why do you think washington gave up on samsonov because the guy is a head case there is something wrong with him.
I hope when i see them in anaheim jan 3 we see the good leafs team with hopefully joe in net
The list we need to actually be a cup contending team is getting very long. Fire Shanahan and Keefe first. Then get rid of Samsonov no matter what it costs. And get another goalie we can afford that is not a pylon. Plus the forwards we have do NOT play defense at all. Then get 2 defense that hit people and win puck battles and hate to lose. Then get at least one 4th liner who actually plays like a 4th line player throwing hits and keeping the puck in the other teams end! So in other words expect a early golf season!
I posted this elsewhere, I think I'll repost it here too.  Ooook. First goal is all on Samsonov.  I don't know how he missed that one, there was nothing there.  Second goal started with some brutal defensive zone coverage, leading to a HUGE save by Samsonov.  Unfortunately, the whole Leafs team was skating around enjoying the evening air or something, because no one did anything, and the rebound was picked up by the Sabres and Samsonov had no chance to get repositioned.  Third, the puck is dumped in behind the Leafs' net, Marner gets cute, and turns it over.  That guy then passes it to the Sabre ALL ALONE in the middle in front of Samsonov.  BRUTAL defense again, though Samsonov MIGHT have got that one.  Fourth, Brodie passes it RIGHT to the Sabres at the point.  5 on 3, Samsonov screened, he had NO chance.  Leafs defense is doing nothing, as usual... though considering the 5 on 3, it's hard to fault them.  Fifth goal, the Leafs lose control on the power play, and the Sabres just skate through them like they're not there, despite being outmanned.  Simple, easy shot... and Samsonov misses it completely.  Looked a lot like the first goal, actually.  Samsonov has to get this one too, there's no excuse.  That was it for Sammy.  Sixth goal, the Leafs cough it up on the powerplay AGAIN, and it's a breakaway.  Jones seemed frozen on this play, he barely reacted to the shot.  Mind you, it was a great shot, top cheeze.  Seventh goal, the Leafs defense are skating around watching while the Sabres play some hockey.  By the time the pass comes to the net, there's a Sabre player standing to Jones' left AND his right, both completely uncovered.  In addition, there was no one on the man with the puck.  That's THREE Sabres completely undefended.  Eighth, the Leafs are AGAIN skating aimlessly around while the Sabres pass it through them all, over and over.  Finally, it comes to a man in the slot who whips it past Jones.  Not even ONE Maple Leaf was in defensive position.  Ninth goal looked almost exactly the same as the eighth.  The Leafs defense seemed completely unable to cover ANYONE on the ice, or intercept any passes.  Now, this one, the shot wasn't especially hard, so I'm going to put some blame on Jones here.  He probably should have had this one, but by this point, both Leafs' goalies were completely shellshocked.  There was plenty of blame to go around in this game, not even one Maple Leaf had any kind of decent game.  Samsonov looked terrible, and Jones wasn't much better... but the DEFENSE (if I can call it that) was beyond horrendous.  They looked like a team of 8 year old pee wee players, playing defense for the first time.  Just unbelieveable that professionals even COULD play this badly.  They really earned this blowout.  My point here is, Sammy is still struggling, but this one is NOT his fault.  He allowed two bad goals.  The Leafs managed three goals.  If the defense shows up, on balance, this game is a win.  This one is on the defense.  AGAIN.
It was a thing of BEAUTY!!!!!   :)  :) :)   Too bad #CaptainUnderpants had to have a garbage goal.  :(
Come on people, do we really believe  this team is a Cup contender. This team is mediocre at best and will not even get a sniff at the cup. They might limp into the playoffs but thats as good as it gets. The sooner we accept this maybe the sooner we can begin making changes to the DNA of this team.
Bro turned into Gru for a sec 3:34
Come on Leaf fans, cheer for the best team in Canada Or should I say the NHL. The Vancouver Canucks!
Win win for Steve either Leafs win or views are up
Sabres fans don’t try to keep leaf’s fans out. Sabres lost 9-4 two days ago. We will take their money.
This team in its current state will never win anything.. jthe sheep keep filling the cash cow. Paying the core 4 the majority of the cap isn't working.
Steve,  please.  It's okay  Say Fuck.
I stayed up late just to watch this
What is an LFR?
I listened to the whole thing on radio, I usually watch LFR the morning after, stayed up to watch this one.
This is a job for Zamboni Driver
Martin Jones is ok but he will never be a #1 goalie ever again.
I’m a Sabres fan so it’s good to watch my first LFR of the season
Sabres kick your asses 3 out of 4 games
8 minutes on Sammy alone 😂
Lmao well sabres arnt a playoff team so its ok
Go trade for Jack Campbell, the Oilers would be happy to ship him over...Lolol
Pulling a baby goalie up early and potentially derailing his development and confidence when it’s highly unlikely he’ll be that much better under these completely unfair circumstances is the definition of robbing Peter to pay Paul. That’s some real short-sighted panicked nonsense. Better to not even make the playoffs this year than wreck a goalie who could potentially be a franchise-backbone.
This energy is me and Pens fans 5 days ago...
“Only to be dominated by the Sabres. We’re losing to Buffalo now?”   Geez, and I thought Embarrassing to Garbage was the worst loss, but this is even worse.
"If your job is professional hockey, play hockey professionally" sums this lfr's thoughts well lmao
Honestly Steve, you have to love that your favorite team, your hometown team, is this entertaining.  They win exciting, and they lose even more exciting.  It might be hell on your heart but it's sooooo entertaining.  Congrats on your most watched episode of the season thus far🤣🤣🤣🤣!!!!
But this team is a Stanley Cup Contender right Steve?  They quit every postseason but they’re still a contender right?
You're really surprised, Steve? Really? This team is a mulligan. Carolina took Freddie and Jake Gardiner, maybe Sammy and Morgan? Horrible body language from the Captain...why, because he's saddled with Bertuzzi.
Sabres beating leafs 9-3 and being most inconsistent team in hockey. Please help my sanity as a sabres fan because I have no idea how we won this game.
Double Mulligan! The Leafs haven't had a real starting goalie since Andersen and have the same regard for goaltending as the Oilers do, with both teams hoping to outscore their way out of the puck liking the back of their net. Samsonov had a reputation for being erratic and a not mentally strong when he was playing in Washington. I think he would have been good as a backup, but not as a starter. Until they figure out how to do goaltending, the best the Leafs can do is shore up the blueline a bit (a lot) more to insulate their goaltending.
The last LFR of the year is the biggest bang!
I haven’t been this excited for a reaction since a certain Zamboni driver took the ice.
Lifeblood of the league? 🤔 How do you figure?
MAN LANDED ON THE MOOOOON is gonna be around for a bit I feel
Oh. Is there luck run out ,  all you leaf fans that comment telling me. Oh the leafs are so good ,    Ya. Good teams don’t get beat like that from a bottom dweller team.      Fire. Keefe,  because he is a bad coach. Team don’t listen too him. , and he doesn’t no when to play the right players he is lost. And so much more wrong with him rip the C off of Tavares.  He won’t stand up for his teammates or stand up for himself,  be a man ,  show why you make them millions and can’t afford defence , trade nylander because you can’t afford him , get some defence ,
Timmins is not that bad in his own end. He has had a bad game, but his metrics are quite good.
Turning point of the Leaf's season. Downhill from here.
"Screw you and Merry Christmas!" Steve, I love you, man. I know it sucks for you to have to have made this video, but this bit made me laugh. Thanks for giving us these videos.
I feel you Steve Dangle. This was an ugly one, they are good for at least one a year like this.
“Bonkers McNuts”
What makes me so mad is there are a hand full of games a year where you can clearly point to and say  "They just phoned it in that game"  This is one of them
This video is getting a metric fuck ton of views. 😂  God I hate this team. 😴
Nice haircut Steve!
Yes, Steve is being so hard - keep it up.  As a Lightning fan I like it when Steve acts like this.  Is this the year that Steve loses his voice.
Fuck the Leafs, Go Buffalo!  Thanks for another excellent video Dangle.
Sanity, Steve. Your out of sanity.
52 games from another year of 0 Stanley Cup championship for 57 yrs
Oh well Steve, think of the extra holiday money you will have from all the people coming to watch the video of you freaking out. Season's Greetings!!
lol Steve is going to see quite the uptick in viewer count for this one. He always has good numbers when they lose. A 9-3 loss to Buffalo will have people refreshing the channel the moment the game was over.
....and we'll flubble bubble our way into the playoffs, do nothing, and que up LFR Season 18. Iv'e been a leaf fan since 1970, i know, when you look at players attributes on Stanley Cup winning teams, compared to this team or even the leafs teams recently, not even close.
Steve. Are you saying we could have a, hmm idk, swayman ullmark combo or something? If so I like
Salaries should be docked when you don’t show up to play.
They already put Woll's career at risk giving him this much ice time this early in his career. It turns out he could take the pressure (though sometimes even when you can your body can't). Doing that again for Hildeby would be foolish. At least Woll got to dip his toes into NHL level play prior to this season. Throwing someone into the deep end could ruin their development and that's not something you risk with a prospect like Hildeby. If the Leafs play their cards right and [INSERT STARTER GOALIE HERE] can make do, then in 2 or 3 seasons you could be looking at a very good goalie in Woll starting with Hildeby finishing his development behind him. Obviously that's a lot of speculation and we all know shit happens but getting Woll as much experience as safely possible now is critical and no one should be even thinking about touching Hildeby until he's good and ready and in a position where he can get adjusted at the start of a season as the 2nd seat rather than coming into whatever you'd call the current situation. Having the pressure of almost half the regular season behind us and a team with no confidence in their goalie in front of him sounds like a great way to put at risk what could shape up to be a fantastic career. You can't do that to a kid. I know some of the greats stepped up through adversity but think about all the prospects we don't remember the names of because they were rushed or their development was cut off or they were put under too much pressure too fast.
Better dial up cujo  and find the  CAT.  .
This guy is so out of shape hes out of breath simply from yelling too much.
Leafs havent won the cup since two years before man landed on the moon! LMAO this is why i watch you when the we  have a terrible game, somehow your ranting makes me feel better.
It’s my birthday, and they’re playing the sabres… I knew we were gonna lose… BUT NINE!?!?!?
Anyone else getting Meateater Trivia Zamboni driver mention vibes from this one?
Sending out positive energy for Sammy because we believe in him 😬
Lump of coal for every player
meanwhile my stars had a stunner tonight- if you need a good hockey game go watch that stars nucks game it was crazy good. almost playoff caliber just lacked a fight for that
This is music to my ears! Go Sabres😉
“…SINCE TWO YEARS BEFORE MAN LANDED ON THE MOOOOOON‼️‼️‼️” 😂😂😂ROFL
Leafs eat a buffalo sized turd in Buffalo
I had to leave halfway through the game to go watch Aquaman and man did I have a much better night for it. Disappointed in our effort. We need to win before the Christmas Break.
Feel like I could make the same video about the Devils after tonight.  What an upside down season....
I enjoy the Leafs fans in Buffalo and appreciate them driving over.
Merry christmas Steve Hopefully we'll have a better game next time❤
3:28  c'mon Steve, everyone knows we didn't go to the moon.  not then, not ever.
Merry Christmas 🎄 and LGR!!!!💙🤍❤️
Ah, so it’s gonna be one of THOSE videos…
re: going over the border to watch the game, which I did... I'll add in from Vancouver back to Niagara for xmas and Steve says: Tickets, Beer, Gas (add in..and PARKING... and food...in AMERICAN dollars), but the TIME...omg.  Hockey is FUN right? sigh....
Steve, your entire head was bulging there…
I want to say i saw this loss coming, but not this bad. I feel sorry for steve having to watch that one.
hard to win a game when your starter couldnt stop a beach ball
It’s a luxury to make millions and not show up to work. Shoulda been a nhl player
I feel like Steve needs an ambulance on standby for these videos going forward.
Columbus drops 9 on Buffalo, Buffalo drops 9 on the leafs, the leafs drop 9 on Columbus..?
Steve my deepest condolences, i shouldn’t feel bad after the leafs beat my team 7-0 the other night but i still feel terrible because I don’t know how much more your heart can take
EXACTLY Steve you’re cooking. Sammy NEEDS to get out of this funk in order for this team to be able to succeed. If they stop playing him it’ll be a mistake, Woll can reasonably hold his own but if Sammy is a non-option then the team will be fighting for a wild card spot when they should be in the presidential trophy race. This seems like the type of game that could be the wake up call the boys need. It’s almost the new year, pull it together or you’re gonna be golfing in April again.
Bad night?
Thank you thank you thank you Steve, For Posting Early‼️ That makes my day ‼️
When I first saw the final my first thought was what the hell and Steve's gonna have a heart attack doing LFR
Bonkers McNuts better return in the future. Instant classic.
Ooh this was a spicy one to wait for, a statement game from the Sabres, unfortunately it came against the Leafs, my condolences for you Leafs fans
Listen to how players and fans mad excuses after they lost to the rangers,  this is what you get when your attitude is “we can’t be the reason we lost”.
I'm so excited for this video.
HAHAHAHA
"I would kill to lose in the Stanley Cup Finals . . . " Somehow that comment is going to come back to bite him . . . .
Ill defend Domis -3 if Steve won't. Greenway goal was completely ass should never have gone in, Okoposo goal was a bad pass that Brodie stepped in the way when it was going to Domi and misplayed it, leading to the beeakaway. Can't remember what the 3rd was but he didn't deserve to be a -3 at all
I somehow know this is a one taker before it starts because it's out sooner than normal😂😂😂😂😂
But...... Are you IIINNNNNN???
Give the team you just played a little credit. This healthiest they have been since last year when missed the playoffs by 1 point! Also, the team rallied around the coach who just called out by the fan base! You didn't stand a chance.  Your team turned into Scott Farkus and got there ass kicked!!!
All 550 Sabre fans lmao 😅😅
Here for the beautiful spice on my night after that wild Dallas v Canucks game.   Congrats to the Leafs on finding Campbell 2.0
Well Steve... the Leafs don't deserve a Mulligan. The Leafs took another night off. The Leafs will either destroy Columbus the next game or the Leafs will be game 3 into a ten game losing streak. Then what will the Leafs deserve?
Babe wake up, a new Steve Dangle one take just dropped.  In all seriousness I feel like Toronto sports is entering a new dark era with the Leafs never being good enough, the Raptors sucking and the Blue Jays being a directionless infuriating mess. Back to the 2000’s people!
Now a really Leafy thing would be getting shutout by thew Sharks. No words...
...but what about Gawd's gift to hockey?  Wasn't he good?
Leafs are like a box of chocolates
Zamboni driver for backup.
This might actually be one of your calmest rage against the Leafs videos (minus the first two minutes).
Sabres put up 6 in first meeting with the Leafs this season, then 9 in the next..    Nice.
Do you think the Leafs can trade for Gibson with Samsonov to solve their goalie woes
I guess they weren’t done vomiting! That was horrible
Pylons like domi finally got a goal
This is a fucking Magnum Opus. I'm at 4:19 and i think 8 of Steves neighbors have called for a welfare check, reporting a man in distress. Only 13:81 left to go!
Steve campbell crapped himself beyond repair as is sammy
Let's Go Buffalo!
Here come the views lol
Samsanov is so bad rn. Defense was brutal too but goals 1 and 5 were actual muffins
Steven I’m going to mail you a Life Alert
the only thing that stops a schedule is once in a history type global pandemic
What an intro…..
Leafs get blown away.... QUICK.  To the YouTube!!!  LFR entertainment!
Is this like the loss to the preds?
Bonkers McNutz.
Lmaooo Buffalo owns Toronto
This was therapeutic. I was absolutely pissed. Now, I can relax. Marley Minute is a nice addition to this program.
I can’t wait to watch this one 😅😅😅
I'm sorry, but this makes me feel a lot better after the Golden Knights lost. Sorry Steve
Got my signed book tonight thanks Steve!
DanglePie Time bby
Let’s Go Buffalo!
Where does this rank in the worst losses in the Matthews Era? Here’s my list: 1 David Ayres game 2 2019 Game 7 vs Boston 3 2021 Game 7 vs Montreal 4 2022 Game 4 vs Tampa 5 7-1 vs Scranton Penguins 6 This game Did I forget any?
Buffalo Sabres is Toronto Maple Leafs father
Just clicked on the video, but last time i remember the intro getting cut off like that was game 6 vs montreal. Uh oh
As a caps fan I saw it coming a mile away. This is why we let Sammy walk, he has way more stinkers than good games can never find his posts and is too mentally weak to be a starter. Once his confidence is gone it’s over it’s not coming back.
This NHL season makes 0 sense 😂😂
Almost as good as 'We lost to a zamboni driver!" LOL. From a Canes fan.
Samsonov f*ck you get off my Hockey Team.
9-3? What does that sound familiar?
Got to watch this in person. I’m sorry Steve but watching all those leafs fans leave in droves hit better than therapy ever could
Fuck The Maple Leafs Let's FUCKING Go Buffalo Sabers Finally Got First win tonight About Fucking time Let's FUCKING go buffalo Sabers Beat the fuck out you Haha😂😂😂😂
Team is bipolar. 😂
You’re absolutely right in your rant. Sheesh. JPE
Trade Samsonov. He sucks
It is absolutely fantastic to see Buffalo beat Toronto at their home ground in front of an 80% road Maple Leafs crowd
this ones gettin popular
This should help get you to that view count you mentioned lol
I take so much joy in this guys manic videos after a loss. It’s slightly less satisfying than watching the oilers lose
We just need to exile sam
Nothing beats the classics
I want to stop watching this sport man.
“Who’s backing up Jones?” Well.. you do have that 42 year old Zamboni driver who ALREADY works for you.. he’s undefeated!
At least the Sabres had a goalie.
My autograph book came in today!  Thanks for offering autograph copies, Steve! 😊
Start cheering for another  team Buddy
Dont have a nervous breakdown steve we knew they where going to lay a egg thats what they do against teams that are near bottom of the standings it never fails i think its absoluetly 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yep. Saw this coming from a mile away.
So what's worse, this or the 9-2 Nashville game?
Welcome fans of all teams other than the leafs to your first LFR of the season!   Signed, A Habs fan watching his first lfr of the season
Yeah, this one is gonna do well. Love ya Steve.
As an Oilers fan, it really makes me feel better to hear about other teams’ goalie stress.
Steve I hope you keep a close eye on your cholesterol and blood pressure
Sammy is just broken and unplayable at this point.
Honestly, kinda glad this game was blacked out...in Saskatchewan, CANADA  (Of course, the Pens/Canes game wasn't)
It’s 12:22am in Nova Scotia. We have bad weather and I stayed up just to make sure I had WIFI to watch this LFR.
Hello fellow tourists, I’ve watched almost all LFR’s this year, and poor Steve has the Sadists coming.
Honestly lots of blame to go around tonight but you had it exactly right this team quit tonight I had hope going into the third and they threw in the towel.
We’re going to crush the COLUMBUS BLUE JACKETS 9-4 on Saturday.
Hey Steve, your Leafs have degraded the Rangers victory over Tahrantah. Nine 9️⃣?!?! Haha 😂
This team quit on your many years ago Steve, life’s much happier when you stop caring for them
Look on the bright side, travelling Leafs fans, you could still go to the outlet malls.
i knew this was coming lmao
Any Leafs fan that pays attention knew they'd blow dong like this tonight. Called it when CBJ beat the wheels off of Buffalo on Tuesday.   This team has learned nothing.
this is what I've been waiting for. Christmas has came early
When your goalie lets in goals that were so bad that they would make a peewee house league coach face palm I can't even blame them for quitting, that kinda thing doesn't just take the wind out of your sails, it cuts down the entire mast.
I am at a loss for words. Thanks for supplying the words, I couldn’t express, Steve. Infuriating.
this was the first game the Sabres had all of their top two lines playing and man that was a huge difference, but I love my Sabres and this was so much fun
Sabres fans hate going to Leafs games. As a leafs fan I don’t think you know how ignorant and annoying leafs fans are. Keep coming tho. Have some wings
There might as well have been a Zamboni driver in the other net tbf
Lol it the poops again Steve
Whats LFR stand for
Here after Canucks in Dallas. Fair to say, any disappointment I felt was washed away in the first 5 seconds by Steve Dangle. 😂
this is why they fail in the post season
No face has ever needed a beard more than Steve's.. But in a cruel twist of fate, he cannot grow one..
As a fan who went to the game tonight it was one of the most depressing and embarrassing moments I’ve ever had as a fan. Leafs fans outnumbered sabres fan, families coming together around Christmas time showed up in massive numbers. I went with my dad we are maybe able to go once every two years. It was pathetic and insulting to see that performance in front of thousands of your own fans who travelled to a different country to watch you play. Waste of hard earned money and time
I quit, but on the new jersey devils. Its ridiculous how inconsistent the team is. No hope anymore for the devils, peoples expectations were way too high for them and I think after last seasons fluke, we go back to our consistent crappy seasons between 2012 and 2018 and 2018 to 2023. Over it
Only thing missing in this one was a Zamboni driver release to not show up and they left their goaltender out to dry and then they get it to the other one to
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂 leafs suck
Bonkers McNuts 🤣 4:20
The money they spent is still cheaper then going to a game in Toronto
This team is drastically taking years off Steve's life. We need a heart monitor reading on his videos
1st goal and I turned it off...Robertson gets crushed and the Leafs just ignore the guy who did it who then goes on to score...team showed no fight plus Samsonov in net = an expected loss (though not by that much...)
I BOUGHT SPORTSNET 4K FOR THIS GOD DAM. CHEAPEST OPTION PACKAGE WISE FOR ME TOOO AND STILL A WASTE TO SEE THIS GOD GEEZ HELP MY TEAM
Sabres fans here?
Leafs just suck, are we ready to have that conversation?
Been refreashing for bit finally, You kown its gonna be a "STINKER"
"all 550 sabres fans" Steve is flaming errbody
Lul
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
people said the reeves injury and irl spell is fake... if that was real we woulda used that on samsonov.... dude has no idea how to make a save,,, looks like a child in little league out there
at 3:14 he’s basically making fun of Sabres fans cuz they barely have any fans so by saying smth like “they only have 500 fans in the building”
😊
No intro, one take, 9-3. Remember this one.
Please don’t pop a vein before Christmas, Steve
Habs fan here, nice to see you happy Steve
Sometimes I hate being a fan of this team
Watching this at 6am in Europe 😂
Here comes the most viewed lfr this season
I kept refreshing my YouTube feed waiting for the video to drop. 🤣
Leave it to the Laffs to ruin the GTA's Christmas 😂
I was at this game. It was painful
AHHHHHHHHHH
Oh, hell.  Not only a night-of video, but before midnight... _turns down volume_
Leafs constantly play down to their opponents. They don't have that keel instinct and it shows everytime they play down
GRAB THE POPCORN FOLKS!
anybody else have buffalo -5.5?
I'm just glad the guy I'm facing in fantasy benched Thompson.
This is the video we've been waiting for
THIS IS NASHVILLE 9-2 V2
Dangle, turn away from the light!!!
This was the worst game and probably will be for the next few years. Hopefully we’ll have a response for Columbus on Saturday.
finally a good video bois
The reason I’m subscribed has arrived 😤
Hmmm this video seems interesting 🤨 😏😏
Oh this is gonna be gold
I’m legitimately surprised Steve Dangle didn’t spontaneously combust watching the Sabres destroy the Leafs.
My goodness... That intro. Please be better Maple Leafs 😅
HERE WE GO BOIS. WE GOT THE BANGER LFR OF THE YEAR EARLY
Been waiting for this one the minute I saw Buffalo up 9-3 😂😂😂
Predators 9-2 suddenly got topped😭😭💀💀
Samsonov, get ready to learn Russian buddy
I got sad.
As soon as they reel you in, they put your head in the dirtiest toilet they can find. Such is the leafs and the existence of leaf fans.
That was fast lol
Happy holidays!
Clicked faster than my dad grabs a beer when he gets home from work
I love Steve but I’ve been waiting since the Zamboni incident for a video like this
Idk how Steve still has a voice 😂
Great video incoming🥱
Nashville 9-2 Redux
Yearly Steve dangle visit came early
First also GO Canucks
Get out of here non leaf fans
What is going on man
Hiiiiii

First
INSTANT CLICK BABY
Been waiting for this one. Sorry Steve…
