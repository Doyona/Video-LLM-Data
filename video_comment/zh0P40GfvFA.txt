It's good don't  get me wrong  but nle can do better than that
Make a better  diss track dummy
Is it just me or am i the only one that noticed he is acting and sounding like 2pac? Either way this is tuff
Complete garbage
What don’t make sense is Choppa talking about being role model to the youth like he never made songs sayin “if I was a slut I’d wanna fuck me too Id wanna suck me too” “play with my gooch while you suck me”. You can’t escape death and kids know this it’s why kids have been playing cops and robbers cowboys and indians since the beginning. Rapping about all this pervy shit and acting like you’re trying to save the children from people like Youngboy is crazy because people like Youngboy make pain music that children can relate to when you live a fucked up life those songs make you feel free as a child even when murder and sex is brought up there is always a message in every song that’s why I’ve been listening to YB for so long but what the youth won’t relate to is slut me out 1, 2, and 3
wait why is he dissing yb someone get me hip. haven’t been paying attention 😂
this like the kendrick lamar vs drake part two lol
Went crazy
Who's he beefing with

KO
Yk ahí naz good 😂😂
To me NLE is simply mad he’s not youngboy and don’t have his career he came out meatriding yb saying he was his fav rapper he came out tryna rap gangsta even tho we could see that’s not him and he had a ok buzz but nobody really bumping no nle fr except literal kids he don’t got no old and young hardcore fan base like yb…. He started meat riding von and them too took they side in the beef and started not liking yb because he was dissing von after he died talking bout “he didn’t kill him so why he rapping about it” like Chicago didn’t start that dissing the dead wave over 10 years ago including dudes they never killed durk included but when yb do it it’s a problem. Truth is can’t nobody fw yb rn and when it’s too much love somebody gotta hate I’m just calling it how I see it. He been bouncing back n forth between gangsta rap spiritual rap woke we shall overcome ass rap etc. when honestly I feel like if he woulda took off with that gimmick he had off rip and woulda been big as yb he wouldn’t even be talking like this he at war with himself and don’t know who he is point blank because his fake gangsta persona didn’t play out now he’s tryna go against exactly what he was tryna be
Song goes hard but the video is a bit zesty like an episode of the boondocks
NLE Raps way better then YB it's not even close
Damn I like it.Did childish Gambino direct this it's giving me this is American vibe

Ko 🎉
Nle choppa i fuck wit this song
Dont go any further 🫡🤔
Not bad expression. But honestly I’ve listened to a lot of youngboys music through the years and he’s always talked about not being a gangster, not being a bad person. He has tracks saying he’s surrounded by people stepping in blood. As long as he’s creating authentic music he’s proving he’s more of a product of his environment. If he truly grows, is authentic and keeps making songs with passion and heart like astronaut kid, valuable pain, cross me, then he will be fine. This seems more like his journey of finding himself through it all. Even his mixtape colors, it’s a portrayal of how he wants to be his authentic self
KO'D THAT BOY HE AINT GOT NO RESPONSE FOR THIS ONE NLE GREATER 🦍🦍🦍🦍
Yb aint coming back from ts
IDC what anyone says this guy's versatility and choreography needs to be commended. The effort is 🔥🔥🔥
Yb still better tho

A lot of these people hatin. But yall know Nle speaking facts. Yb don’t do half the stuff he talk abt or live up to half the talk he on. A lot of rappers don’t. Not just Yb, but the whole rap/ hip hop industry lost its value. NLE speakin what is already happenin and people to blind to see it.
Song and video dope. Very creative
we  should have more rappers doing more songz like this stop standing stif in the club 3ang 3bang 3ang
Interesting.

Damnnnn🤣
Thanks for helping bringing back musicality, dance, visuals, stage presence to rap. Everyone involved in the production of this song and video should be proud. These things dont happen spontaneously, this was an ambitious project with a lot of work and attention to detail in the choreography, acting, editing... all of them combined making this high quality production. Video of the year for me.
Is this AI?
Is it just me or our Black ppl wit PLATFORMS not showin love to NLE the Great for the creativity tht brings love to our Greats tht pathed a way for us??? @thebreakfastclub @joebudden

Nle please stop this nonsense and go back to the shotta flow nle please
NLE Choppa is the best video songs do let the haters hit and youngboy’s mom  is gay and you are the best bro k  rest in peace von❤❤❤😊
The video artistry is fire 🔥. The way he's paying homage to past black cultural icons is dope. I gotta listen to the song itself a little more.
Nle back from but what is this why u bald😭
Gayyyyy,
His voice annoying 😅
Tupac would slap u silly son! Five fingers to the face 👋
You cant talk tough and move like a whole female that was hard to watch bro dude needs his estrogen checked, i think yb a wierdo too but this is just off the chart zest, this is not the gucci vs jeezy days or pac vs biggie this is just queerdo behavior, they gotta be putting something in the tap water
Childish Gambino “ this is America “ vibes 👍🏽
Michael Jackson and Tupac version W 2:56

Tupac never shook his hips at biggie and co
Shit trash and i like nle
LIL NAS CHOPPA 😂😂😂💀
Bros cooked
Freemasonry Chess Floor
Yes I just got to say big ups to NLE the king and goddamn me up look I don't listen to a lot of rap but I'm loving this This is a beautiful piece of art Clean up on our trade n*****
Definitely pushing the envelope
Also, why does Wikipedia say he’s 6’ tall? This nigga ain’t more than 5’8 at the most.
Why he look like Chris brown, Tory lanez and Michael Jackson at the same time? For someone who portrays a gangster he sure does look gay as fuck in this video.  It’s hilarious when these rappers pretend to be gangsters and then wear fishnet bodysuits.  I have never seen a man wear a gayer outfit in my life.   If I was a detective I would put NLE on a watch list for the simple fact that he dresses like Sam smith who is the gayest singer ever
Clover so beautiful ❤️  Got her daddy's bright soul
Yooooo! He killed that shit!!!! Is an understatement! Very impressive 💯👏
He's a mason now. Or in black boule. Everything in this video is a choice. Especially that checkerboard floor 😉   It's ok Choppa I still love you, just don't lose your soul. Cause it's a good one.  P.s this is brilliant

KO excelent
It grew on me frfr i love this song now and the video fire
No wonder hip hop has fallen of the charts. Bring back good hip hop
Ts is ass
Yo this is hard 😂
I think Michael and Tupac inspired him 🤭
this is soooo ass yb is better
Ok...now this is some new shit from Gen Z. OMG, so happy to see real production, evolution, artists really honing a craft, appreciating their platform, and giving fans more than just some trash videos shot in the hood, standing on top of cars waving guns and money. WE'RE OVER IT!!! And the people want and deserve more. This is the MORE. This is humility at it's best....he trusted the teams and the elders around him to create something prophetic & this was the result. Something bold and timeless. Regardless of how you feel about NLE or YB, this video is fire and stands alone. Bravo!!!! And ain't nothing "sus" about it...it's art and entertainment, it's just not what we're used to getting, which is sad!! Hats all the way off for his commitment to step outside the box & flex his talent.
This is all talents....
Disturbing! So talented, but waste your energy on expressing music with toxic feelings. NLE embrace your music on positive energy. Both of you are so talented stop the nonsense and collaborate together. Change the world!!
Dafuq is this bullshyt
This video shows a massive level of talent... But it's mad weird 😂🤦🏽‍♂️. Buddy is in a sheer sleeved shirt whooping another man who is wearing a collar.  Just what in the hell 😂🤦🏽‍♂️
I love the Graphics
Yb fans can’t process any of this 😂😂
I hate it when an artist enjoys their humiliation ritual 😈LOL
I like what he trying to say but this is wack 😭😭 video fire doe ngl
Ggs nle see u in heaven
Choppa had 23 months to do this song and video. So of course he perfected it lol
NLE just transcended the modern day rap era with this one. I hope he sticks to this style and keep elevating. Hopefully the beef don't get deadly.
رائع يا نلي لقد كنت مايك ومايكل وتوباك،🔥
Singing ko and dancing Michael Jackson dancing on some gay shit😢 this boo boo ain’t no rap beef about dancing around like some idiots talking shit about someone if from nyc wtf kinda bullshit is this
🔥🔥🔥🔥

Why the Ugandan flag in a beef song?
I’m going to tell my kids this was Tupac the greatest rapper that ever existed
From a 16 year old that made shotta flow to a father with a new era so fye🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥
Yb fans got ragebaited
Maranatha!!!
This boy obviously is losing his mind because one minute he says one thing about Jesus God serenity, finding himself in things of this nature now you’re talking about killing somebody KO trying to avenge King Von I don’t understand that was the worst video I’ve seen properly in my entire life It could’ve been so much more if it was on a positive tip, but nothing in that video was positive. He’s obviously crossed over to the illuminati or he’s drugged up out of his mind. That was the worst video I’ve ever seen.💯
He did that
Ko
Ko
The beef aside this video creative as hell can’t lie🔥🔥
This was refreshing for Hip Hop,  I'm born in the 70's and rap was about dissing with a message and not clothes and cars
Wearing women’s garments in a diss song lol
Please sample how do you want it by 2pac NLE Please
Oakley
This is terrible yb is better who is with me. 👇

Video so creative
Video decent but not matching the theme if a dis song lol . Vant be dancing and dissing at the same time its a big no no.  Too many air humps and toung movements while saying talking about another man ijs
2:18 -2:29 was OHHH TEAAA
All the homage he paid in this video....But the ultimate is the homage to PAC....... Not only at the end of the video but he sampled the same song from PACs "Hit em up"
STRAIGHT FIRE!!!!!!!!

I Love this song 👏🏾👏🏾💪🏾💪🏾❤️❤️
Good choreography!!!! Dam good choreography!
Disney diss
Some things you don't disrespect

Didn’t this KO song come out and then 1990s or something? This song is old but I love this song nle I got suspended from school for threatening a kid and then I got suspended for stealing at Walmart even that I didn’t. I don’t know why but I always loved your song especially how you’re dissing YB. I you for making this songwwwwwwwwwwwwwww❤❤❤❤❤
And this is supposed to be a “beef” track? I feel conflicted. I lived long enough to see artists beef’n like Eazy n Cube, then Pac & Big…. this is what beef is now, huh?
This is beef? Smh
💅
Super ass 🗑

Soft bruh woody right you jealous trying to revive your weak ass rap career.

Spiciest diss track I've ever seen
Took you 4 yrs to come up w this bullshit
Didn't know NLE got down like this

From start to finish video and song 🔥 🔥🔥
2 weeks no response. This isnt a k.o, one man didnt even show up for the fight 😂
These rappers ain't men anymore, they femin-men. Rap tough be clearly gayoo!
Male Doja. I didn’t think he’d be one to watch, but I’m watching. 👀
Yeah this is one of those you put up there as a masterpiece. NLE killed it to the highest degree. So proud of this young man.
Gay o gay o
This a perfect soundtrack for some video game.
Ko😮😮
NLE, this is one of the most creative rap songs in the 21st century. Its so sad the most see it only as a "pac ripoff".
Michael ass
I wasn’t feeling this but it’s ong growing on me heavy 🤣🔥
I didn't know he had so much character and creativity, And he spit....I like it ❤
This was confusing and weird, to many different vibes happening at one time. If it was for all the choreography I would be able to take it seriously cause the bars were tough. Like str8 shots but everything else threw me off was giving LGB vibes
KO
30KEY killed 🎧
Running down the street with young boy head???
Rap music is missing this type of creativity, where it feels like you’re watching a movie not just hearing the music
This video is a true work of art.
It's in times of war
Times of war
NLE jumped to the front of the game with this one. The video is a masterpiece and there wasn't a wasted word, he killed it💯
I thought Justin Jefferson popped up
Finally I can resub my mans found himself again💯
I love this song
Dising somebody while dancing Zesty is crazy!
The man's in Trouble 😂
Good ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Damn all my old co workers in this bih 😂
Horrible
I cant even lie. This song been stuck my head for 10days at least
2pac inspired. Love it!
This video was visually entertaining and the homage was paid‼️🔟🔟🔟🔟🔟
KO ko the Russians are gonna run up on ya. Break my teeth and ur rib cage gonna shatter
lol 😂 nba fans be crying now 😂
What the fuck did I just watch?
I liked the video. It was creative
this song is so good, omg
He came out thinking he was kendrick or something lmao
ayo NLE .... i got sum fo you tho..🔥 CONTINUATION (your vibe, your energy)  Yahweh, Yahweh… Cross that line, boy, you meet doomsday.  [Verse – Continuation]  I been calm but the storm in me back now, Sword on my tongue, finna lay a whole pack down. Ops online but in person they back down, Talk like giants but they move like background.  I don’t beef with the weak, that’s a downgrade, I’m tryna purge all the evil in the soundwaves. Heard you summonin’ demons for some clout plays — I send angels that’ll spin through your pathways.  Soul cleaner, mind deeper, the blade ether, Word sharper than a bullet from a street sweeper. If I’m knockin’ at your door, better keep Jesus, ’Cause my presence leave a grown man speechless.  You corrosive, I’m explosive, the smoke potent, I’m the omen in the moment, when the gate open. You be barkin’ for attention like a broke Trojan, I bring judgment, every verse feel bone-soakin’.  You a puppet, you a vessel for the lost minds, I’m the scribe of the heavenlies, I cross lines. If you step, better prep for the chalk lines, Your whole kingdom get flipped like a fault line.  Never ran from a man, not once, ever. What you do, I can do better — forever. Your whole squad movin’ funny — whoever. When I shoot wisdom, it’ll pierce through leather.  You the darkness that crumble under real light, You the villain that tremble when the truth strike. If you walk in my lane, it’ll end right — Six feet deep, tucked in, good night.
Itching to get clapped … everybody that beef with YB is d3ad - one of the cardinal rules of the Art of War is choose your enemies wisely
NLE Zesty
Buba Sparx ?
Finally some hip hop
a lot of comments saying this is “creative” - im old school this is ghay asf 😂 - why he always dancin and sheet - reminds me of vanilla ice def not pac
I can't lie. I Love this lil Song. 😏  I'm from Memphis. I gotta ride with Home Team. No matter Right or Wrong. 💯
Get his ass nle 🔥
Nle really slid for Von on dis
I love this. He performs and rap the shii out this song. They can never make me hate this man. His fina ahh doing his shii.
Naw my mom how many times are you going to play this 😅
Yo fuck nle, yb the goat.
WTF IS GOING 😢😢😢😢😢 THIS IS SAD
if tupac was gay
Ok lil boy you snapped me like 😍🥰
Bro this was way better the. NBA young boys shit omg wow
Old head here! This might be the first song of his that I ever heard.  Is this how his music typically sounds?  I’m not a fan at all
2:23 !!!! I hope he’s fans are listening, especially the women!! Men won’t promote this way behavior if they know they won’t get away with it!
I like this‼️ lyrics music metaphor innuendos creativity the sample vocals and visuals 🔥
He killed it🔥🔥
bro hit the 2pac
KO
I was confused at first when he came out with this bc it seemed random however I like what he speaking and the video is entertaining.
I mean A+ for effort but something that would be much more beneficial than calling someone else out on being a horrible role model… how about calling out yourself for doing the same.   An individuals words they preach mean nothing when they don’t vicariously live through them themselves.
😂😂😂🔥
Smoothiest mix of 2pac, MJ and Breezy you will ever see
Nah this is tuff 😂❤ where’s the yb fans at 👀 😂 🙄 anywho I’m team nle 😊
Too much zest in a diss track
Choreography and lyrics with a message. I rather have this than a bunch of weirdos waving guns and cash at the camera for a music video.
Remember his other “Tupac” song “Picture Me Grapin”
He is letting YoungBoy know what it is!
That shit goes hard, he put every effort into this
My son sent me this video. The lyrics are so deep. ❤
❤
What?
i like it but i miss the og nle
I don't normally listen to this kind of hip hop.  This track is actually legit.  I can't stop listening to it.
WTF!!!!?????
Spitting facts, YB preaches about nothing but destruction and a lot of other clones copy that style and it shits all over the industry
Tupac reincarnation!?
Dancing thugs 😂
This was the whackiest shiid ever
GayPac

Get off his nuts you haven’t dropped shit in months and now you just making it about one person. Rap career is sinking buddy and you trying everything you can to stay above water. Didn’t say shit after he dissed you way back. Now you’re not soft. Internet is calling him pac and Michael of this generation and you trying to act like em
This song is wack.
Daaaam this some throw back real visual story telling. Make you want to re watch
Make sure not to actually become him because you know what Happened…Also love the music

A friend of mine did 11yrs in different prisons and he was adamant about the fact that all black dudes are gay. Gangster or not they were all gay.
PC choppa
What if there was a dissing within countries instead of wars among eachother 😊
Low key a banger 🤔 this’ll blow up sooner or later. The video itself is kinda 🔥
This ain’t it

Young dudes just keep rapping? Both of y'all hold the power? By doing no violence just keep the rapping up? I'm interested in who? can keep these songs going without reacting with violence like they all are thinkN y'all will. As I said you hold the power by not being violence. Keep it in the rapping arena I promise you too will be more successful that way? After all it's about who is the best rapper keep it coming I'm listening? Always respect yourself always respect other people.& if you don't 9 times out of 10 U!! Will regret IT. Fr GMCG 1 ✌️😎👣👣👣🌅🕴️🕴️🕴️⛓️⚖️

I’ve been meaning to write this for a while, and I hope you see it—not just the words, but the heart behind them. I miss the old Choppa. The energy, the hunger, the rawness that came through every bar. When you first came up, it felt like you were speaking directly to people like me—young, hungry, trying to find our voice in a loud world. “Shotta Flow” wasn’t just a hit, it was a movement. You weren’t just rapping—you were exploding through the speakers. That version of you lit a fire in so many of us. I still remember bumping your early tracks with my friends, windows down, volume up, feeling like nothing could touch us. You had this wild confidence, this fearless vibe that made us feel like we could take on anything. You weren’t trying to be perfect—you were just real. And that realness? It stuck with us. It made us fans for life. I respect your growth. I see the journey you’re on, the way you’ve evolved spiritually, mentally, and musically. That takes courage. You’ve shown us that there’s more to life than flexing and fighting—that healing matters, that peace matters. And I salute that. But I also want you to know that the old Choppa—the one who came in swinging, who made us feel invincible—is still missed. Not because we don’t support your evolution, but because that version of you gave us something we didn’t even know we needed. There’s a whole generation that grew up with your music as the soundtrack to our grind, our pain, our come-up. You helped us through heartbreaks, fights, late-night drives, and moments when we didn’t know who we were. Your voice was there. Your beats were there. And that version of you—the one who didn’t hold back, who spit fire with every verse—is still living in our playlists, our memories, and our hearts. I’m not asking you to go back. I’m just asking you to remember. To remember what that era meant to your fans. To maybe tap into that energy again, even if just for a track or two. Give us that wild Choppa roar again. Let us feel that fire. Because it’s still in you—I know it is. And we’re still here, waiting, riding with you no matter what. You’ve got fans who love every version of you. But some of us are still holding on to the one who made us feel like warriors. The one who made us believe we could rise, no matter what. That Choppa changed lives. That Choppa made noise. And that Choppa is still a legend. Much love, respect, and loyalty,
What the ****?

I'm investing in this song because he praise Jesus
Best song since Michael Jackson..hallelujah yhwh ahavah
Whoever directed this video, and choreographed this. This is top tier artistry. Round or applause for NLE the Great for trusting it. I know alot of people saying the dance moves are SUS. I actually dont have a problem with it, it worked well. Its refreshing to see all encompassing art from the song to the visuals to the choreography. I'm not even a fan of NLE but I love this song, and the tributes to the greats from music and sports. 💯💯
solo io sento too cool be careless in sottofondo?
This is running out with this new hair, bald ass 😂😂😂😂😂😂
❤ Did Chris Breezy help with the Choreography? 🕺🏾🌠  The visuals are very artistic 👨🏾‍🎨

The video was creative but to much dancing you tryna be like Tupac & Chris brown, when you should be yourself a 🤡. No diss but you a funny animated type like Kai and speed. Thats where you'll get your message spread quicker than this platform.
Basura 🗑️

NBA give up
Im yelling f*ck NBA youngboy, you heard what I said/ Pistol whip that Lil b*tch put another dent in his head/ This ain't no diss record, its the truth that boy is goofy/ One day he straight thugging, the next he wearing a kufi/ Pick a side lil homie you confusing your fans/ And When you rap, whats all that weird sh*t you do with ya hands/ Is you throwing up gang signs because you  repping a set/ Or are you disabled and have some rare unknown form of tourettes/ You been wack since you first dropped songs tryna be edgy/ You heart dont pump blood, that sh*t pumping confetti/ Yous are lame and you emotional steady popping them pills/ Cuz the money slowed up cant pay your property bills/ Aint nobody checking for you cuz they know you the fakest/ Remember that time I ran down on you  out  in las vegas/ I Had you sh*tting bricks bout to dig in ya pockets/ But lucky for you the hotel security was able to stop it/ Then your b*tch a$$ left the city booked a flight later on/ Had you scared for ya life for putting my name in that song/ We ain't beefing over b*tches or  the fame or some clout/ Don't make me tell the whole world what this really about/ Just keep my name out ya mouth ,so  I won't have to expose you/ Cuz going back and forth online is what them hoes do I told you, but I guess its time for me to show you/ This is what happens when you play someone you close to/ ima stay ten toes down like a real one supposed to/ Them little tight a$$ shirts you wearing, im putting holes through/ Got me going super saiyan its like im goku/ promise im alot  more dangerous than who you sold your soul to/ I Said listen little boy you stepping to a shooter/ Don't make me mention  Alice, kodi or kentrell jr./ Don't forget the other names, best keep'em in ya memory/ And next time you see me I hope you got this same energy/  Naw, I aint done ima finish'em round one/ Tell the world who it is you stole ya whole style from/ These are the facts,  you aint scaring nobody, your weak and frail/ Heard that  call with you crying to come home after a week in jail/ Talking bout you suic*dal and ready to call it quits/ It's safe to say you dont gotta wonder why they all called you b*tch/ Throwing rocks then hide your hand every time that you missed/ And after this i bet yo punk a$$ jump back on the d*ck/ I pull up to where  you at brought a mac and a switch/ Tell shorty fall back, you dont wanna put  jazlyn in the mix/ Matter of fact, I got someone for her, she a bad little b*tch/ Met her in 05' she used to help wit unpacking the bricks/ she gon do what i say when I say it and   thats  it/ Get ya whole family put in a box that'll never be open again/ Game over!, now you really  can't be broke again/
Wackest music video i ever seen. Cloutchasinhoe

Talent vs talent. I like this....let's get it!
He asking for it 😆
He asking for it 😆
" WHAT " WOW
IS EVERYBODY IN THIS COMMENT SECTION STUPID OR FAKE? IT SURE SEEMS LIKE IT!
Remember what nle said its nothing serious when it hits the Internet 🤷he said the after nba dropped a diss so it has to be vice versa right?
How can you dance in a diss video to a diss song? The beef isn't real. Just wave riding.
Pure entertainment. Mission accomplished. No real beef.
Sybau b for bald💔💔💔🥀
YB won’t be creative or lyrical for his future responses😂😂
honestly nle dropping something that is about bettering the youth but the blame of the youth being bad is nba youngboy makes sense but damn they both make great music 😿
New category unlocked: Gaynsta Wrap
"when i do it its different, when he do it its ignorant" ngl choppa cooked with this one
U can c n hear , he adores Pac.
Love the pac and MJ inspo song is 🔥

🤨😀🧐🤨🤔 Ai 🤖 NLE 😂🤯KO✊🏿
Outstanding work Mr Nle
Bruh how is no one talking about how NBA youngboy gonna spend the rest of his life never being able to make a song good enough to even respond to this properly.   He might literally try to slide this fool cause he can’t make a song better than this. Bet he gonn try 🫵😂
I thought it was a.i.  that crazy
Boombiye
I actually like this.
you cooked

thourghout
thought life i’ve had some suicidal thoughts but usually ignored them
I’m sorry but all yall in the comments talking about this is art this is great we need more , forgive me im lost but it got be most of yall young don’t know the original song . This man f**k this song up who ever cleared the sample for him need to be shot this trash and at this point yall like this garbage im about to start rapping CEO C.H.E.X Baltimore own I’m coming to restore true music hip hop this garbage last time I check gang bangers and gangster dint dress up like Micheal Jackson and dance like diddy in the video I give this the Siegel and Elbert show two thumbs down straight ass
Also love that you was listening to juesus alot
nice diss nle love you man i like that you are respecting tupac as well RIP TUPAC
Use to love nle tbh but the fact he has to use a dead compact influencer aka pac to regain fan base is just absolutely diabolical he could've done better instead of using pacs revenue to make fanbase you know youngboy has always been better at getting success in the rap game. Nle is influenced by pac YB is influenced by himself and his family. Nbas authentic in the music industry was never gained by featuring popular individuals to their he gained his success by being good in the rap game that's why he will remain the goat😂. R.I.P nle
Pretty good pretty good but young boy gonna drown u
Proudly South African, thanks for showing our beautiful flag
Nle ate this up
WTF is this 😂😂😂😂 GAY ASS SHIT😂😂😂
Young fella is scratching the Childish Gambino Artistry with this one (interesting) I’ll have to keep an eye on champs art.
man the songs actually a banger…and SOME of the vids bangin..i just think SOME of the dancin in the vid took away from the intensity..a furious diss track aint supposed to have the rapper gyratin like usher..it was confusing😅…but overall i like that track
The duality checkerboard tells me all I need to know
Pretty creative ngl.
Nle better den yb wtv grape do coo

Kool mv

The song is okay…..😕
He had fun with this diss track 💯
Nle cooked on this

I hated on this song at first but now I’m loving it lol
CHOPPA
Wow
As an adult that knows the difference between music and reality I can say I like yb music but I’ve been saying from day one he’s killing the youth! All these young guys want to be him and wreaking havoc on our communities! S/o to nle for this one!
He slide that sh!+.....hilarious but discreet ❤😂
He did exactly the same thing tho
That ain’t young boy that’s Jalen hurts
This is one of the most magnificent music i have ever heard
I can’t stop listening. This song been going on and on, masterpiece.
He’s so versatile and he can act also he snapped I love that he wasn’t afraid to go in !
Props to the background dancers for killing it !!

I Love U guys ❤
I like this vibe doesnt feel demonic
This video is deep.. U gotta look past all the funny dancing and shit..
People actually like this dogshit?
I love when he throws the 🔫 & takes off his belt 😂😂😂 This spose to be a lesson, not an actual real life tragedy. Reminds me of multiple scenes in Baby Boy + Tyra "We were rooting for you" meme
NLE YOUR BETTER THAN THE WIFE BEATER WE LOVE YOU
Trash what is this crap rap dead
I’m not even a fan of this dude, but this video was dope. It’s a strange angle for a diss record, but it def shows his evolution and creativity..which I think has been a lost art in hip hop, lately. Salute 🫡🫡🫡
I rebuke this
😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Is it me or do I hear the beat of Hit ‘em up from Tupac in the background
6.4 million views 🤷🏾‍♂️🤣

I feel like the only people hating on this song are YB fans or fans of crashout and murder rap
Ik he made some big back off this💰💰
HIGH VIBRATIONAL MUSIC!!
This nga who career is chasing YB tail around
What ever message he was trying to send he definitely sent it with them moves 😂😂😂
These all the references I SEE: Michael Jackson New Jack City/Sugar Hill Baby Boy Mike Tyson Nat Turner Muhammad Ali Marcus Garvey 2Pac Hit ‘Em Up MJs Thriller James Brown And I HEAR many more.
🥷 gaè… point blank
Well, I did hear YB say,  something about "Go get you some views,"    ( 👀👀👀)                      Well, there you                             have it!!! 🤣😅🤣
He talking the truth 🔥
man on a mission
He’ll be the next to be “killed”. Turning this ish into “actual art”?!? “clean up on aisle tre”  2:27 when he “k.o.”ed him from behind?
He think he rap better cause he eats grass and yb and tootsie eat burgers
Yb responded is fire 🔥
I like YB , but this time NLE Nailed 🤬🔫💪
@NLEtheGreat this shit is ass stop making music
I fucking love this!! You killed it man, and that’s right you waited till his out to say something. It’s KO time baby NLE I’m in your corner 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼💯💯
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💀💀
If you all really listen it’s the truth about the youth.. God bless them both
I know you’re not a NBA YoungBoy . you are nobody .NBA YoungBoy Is the goat.
Wow this is wack 😢
💃💃💃💃
Hella hilarious. NLE tweaking like a crackhead that got sugar in his tank 😂
I like him because he’s unapologetically, creatively himself 😅
I don't like how he changed from Choppa to the great.  IT's tony tony choppa not tony tony the great.  Pay respect to the OGS u feel
😮😮
wtf is this 🙄your a lame if u like this 😂
WOW!!!
KO 🔥
Sounds like 2pac
I have supported chop since the very beginning and honestly he should of left yb alone Heavenly Father please protect NLE choppa n his family members amen.
He's showing his range of creativity and I love every minute of it!!
Nle otffffffff
2:24 Dangg the Symbolism is crzy 😢 I'm prolly the only one that peeped but NLE slides in front of the gunman.... and he's wearin red (blood) he betta not try and leave us!! 😑
politics
Lol I watched this because of the amount of views.  I can't believe anyone actually thinks this is good.
Everyone say bye to NLE
Bro really had the balls
Preist: he was murder by NBA youngboy a famous rapper they had a beef it was a honor death but youngboy did chop off his head
NLE Won he a very conscious rapper. YB could never.
Stay outta Richmond and I’m Deadass
Bringing back rap  battles
This shxt hard, different & creative. 😂
They need to leave it the way it is! This beef so good for hip hop just don’t want to see another rapper dead
Yb better
CRINGE

Young boy can't be creative like this 😂😄😄😄💯
Got that South African flag in the video but we still waitin for you to come show love n perform n SA. We tired of Tyla as well😂😂
He knocked him down with two hits. If YB respond he got something in the tuck already….

Why is NLE tryna be Tupac Michael Jackson and have beef with youngboy like gang, your not a street baby no more, blue face doesn’t fw you anymore keep being the family man
This shi suck it’s nothing compared to know like I know
Feels like a cross of 2pac and Prince. Impressed 🔥

NLE the Great ❤❤❤ O.K
Dennis Edward’s RESPECT 🫡
He using YB name to sell his own shit I hope this cornball gets popped

Damn thst boy mad on this track who pissed him off...
South African flag 🇿🇦
Ok so he be all good & still presenting all this in a video which he knows innocent watch. Not great, just another rap trying to tap. Creativity isn’t difficult with AI on production sets—READ BETWEEN THE LINES—dude smart to have his momma as his manager b/c now he has masculine & female on his team. Real ones still see✊🏽💯
YOU FUKE #NLE_chappa 🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸
This shi fire 😂 Man..Down
Young boy, no, he can't rap like this.😅😅
The best song
I fuqs wit diss
Bro, this diss track literally destroyed NAB, but please be careful, brother, because problems will keep coming and you might die. So be careful because I can't imagine the world without NLE CHOPPA.
Whoever his choreographer was they made him look stupid as hell. I had to test the song by me doing my dance. Really you didn't have to do all that extra shit. You can dance without doing all that. You is not Tupac and you will never be him
Hit em up!
Is hard
This was banger low key. To be fair tho. It’s the old school style that really sends it over the top. Not to mention. Any diss against yb is gonna gain traction. Mainly since he has nice size of loyal and cult like followers.
Now this is what being an ARTIST means
You only made this song to get attention from nba youngboy so you can get more views and money 💴 so stop dissing nba youngboy pls I just want peace pls stop 🛑
When did NLE turn fruity 🤔 that brudda turn in to a batty boy or something
I had to dance to the song to see for myself. Whoever did the
Bro this is the black version of that new mgk joint where he’s wearing that cliche shirt 😆 that’s what this is! This ain’t Tupac in his death row days this is Tupac in his Baltimore school for performing arts days 😆
This is the best wack song ever 🤣
This is trash
Wondering wat the uganda 🇺🇬 is doing in there
Did young boy.  Dis back.
🎉❤I can't believe it I went to my YouTube badges and it said I was the first person to watch KO
This is crazy 😂😂 diss and a film in one😂😂
What happen that nle ain't on choppa or awaken
who is this song even for??? 🤔
W song
Kokoko
This ain’t aint
Clip of the year 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
This not it the song don’t suck but the video does honestly it could have been cool but shit looks zesty
NLE the Goat 🐐
So the devil is controlling Ynba 😂
Don't care for this song as a song itself I wouldn't listen to it again. However he did his thing as far as a diss track goes
Love this 1💯
I cant take these gay rappers serious 🤣. Songs is cool tho. The video tho to sassy for me  🤣
YB BETTER💚
This kid sold his soul to the devil
Nooo
Most creative visuals i witnessed in a very long time......
This shit beyond weird , talking crazy like Tupac while dancing like Janet Jackson 🤦🏽‍♂️
Mennn 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Pure art
Man you ahh fa ts yb on ya ahh watch
Creative funny as hell.BUT☝🏽u lost before u even hit the studio . U going up against the drake/Kurt Cobain of this generation. U up against a guy who doesn’t bother to promote his albums when he drops. ALSO NBA Youngboy is the only rapper I know who lives the gangster persona 24/7 365. Whether he’s at home at the studio at the mall in a music video in an interview he’s the same. How Igonna beef wit a dude who will  gladly disclose things about himself that any person would do anything to keep private. Remember when Bobby smurder went to prison at a time when he had the hottest song in hip hop his label basically dumped him and didn’t even hire a lawyer 4 him.  When NBA Youngoy caught a gun charge and  some other felonies, the label sent a couple of record execs and lawyers to court and they spoke on his behalf asking the  judge they will vouch for him as far as bail and that if he gets house arrest they’ll build a multimillion dollar studio at his crib so he doesn’t have to leave home to make music.NBA Different. He 1 of dem 1’z NLE Chopps is a great rapper. But NBA Youngboy is an icon. Record labels don’t give 80 million dollar contracts to just any regular rapper. What ppl don’t realise is that NBA YOUNGBOY is 1 of the most intelligent rappers in the game. Ppl don’t see how smart h moves. Most of the things he does might seem random but when you look deeper it’s calculated. NLE Choppa probably would a been had a similar trajectory but when u keep switching up the persona u cultivated with your fans support, the fans will start viewing u as inauthentic . Authenticity is the only thing u have in saturated market like hip hop
Am I tweaking or is this beat reminding me of west coast vs east coast hmmmm
Heavenly Father I ask that you be with us in all that we do, so that we may experience your life as we apply what you've taught us.
🥶🥶🥶
😂😂always  been  a clown
Cinema 🎥

Wackkkk
Trying to be Kendrick lol
I love NLE, he can’t do any wrong in my book. He’s young but intelligent and growing ❤

Wack af😂 he trying to be mj/tupac/yb😂
Aww, I see his little girl too!! No one could ever make me hate NLE!!
This dope but ong ppl should just stop dissing and beefing with young boy. It's the same message. "He's emotional." Like if he's emotional why mess with him then? You know he lashes out. Why feed into it? I can tell there's a lot of spiritualism behind this which is fine and creative but it's the same sad song at the end of the day.  EDIT: Plus we all know NLE was cool with King Von so this just really some interpersonal conflict
me too
🔥🔥🇭🇹
Hold up mane, I been The Most High since 2016
Lamar copy cat, even same style raps and dancing hella lame honestly not even great bars

This is what the music industry should look like. Performers mimicking, real life – not real life, acting as performers. This is artistry.
KO! OK
1:44 I got say, its kinda funny that NLE cos playing Muhammad Ali kinda look like blueface 😂
No day no time u better dan yb and thats fact
Love this!!!!!!
And also in God's eyes you never too late for whoopings
For real though
NLE Choppa < NLE The Great
KO
Damn that was dumb.
😂😂😂
This shit is ass
This shit is stupid crazy hard
Different 😎
This is easily thee most garbage shit ive ever seen or heard
This was a very unique way to lay down a diss track…I don’t think people see the symbolism and metaphors and if you watch it several times and really pay attention this is very well put together the PAC beat I don’t mind because PAC sampled that himself but this is not only a diss it’s art and creativity.
Why does this song sound like "HIT EM UP" ?
Is that a Uganda flag❤❤❤❤ 2:57
Is that a Uganda flag
This is ass 🗑️🚮
Cus this song is fucking crazy about NBA
I’m on my momma page but May God protect NLE & YB. Regardless, this is sad NLE changed his life around, but dissed YB, but really y’all never know what’s going on behind the scenes, in my personal thoughts is something definitely had to happen for NLE to diss him, but NLE if you see this please stay safe, you gotta kid man, don’t bring this shi to no streets, bc ppl be killin rappers n shi js to do it like king von n xx like hn
This is what is sounds like, when you ride on your enemies 🔥
Clean up on isle trey
Is this a devil worship video?
don t look any further by siedah garrett and dennis Edward’s is the sample
Proud of you 💪🏽 Young king 👑 NLE  you brought the truth out without having to do harm or tell our kids to go do harm, to beat on women's, to kill one another you used the youth as it was written in the Bible I applied you for that
My class likes ko thanks nle
I wanted to clown tho but Bro bought back the art of making a dope music video 😂
2pac would not approve of this bs
This shit was a master piece
YB videos do more than 7mill in less than 1 day 😊
U get nowhere from drawing out yb, this song wouldn't even sound like this if yb wasn't around
I havent had a reaction to a man in a music video like this in a while. This is just tooo good
Fuck a rap beef NLE is really serving art direction and references. This is tooooooo good as a rap video.
Somebody protect my baby. I really just an ally but im on his side 😅
peak right here
This was the most zesty rap beef 😂😂
Precisely delivered 🔥🔥
Yall give this 🥷 way to much praise knowing he just gone change his whole image again and probably be calling himself bad btch and over sexualized music in 1-2 months from now

Lowkey sound like the oreillys commercial beat
This shit wack asf and i am not a yb fan
YO WHAT The F-!
Wtf with this tupac fake hear the beat hahaha do some original trip bro
Reality of this is ,we have two different rappers ! NLE Choppa is a rapper who is going straight at the throne, he’s not doing this in a way to start street beef he is 100% chasing the throne !!! NBA YB on the other hand look at it from a street angle because NLE choose sides on some street shyt . NBA is a street dude that’s a rapper , so you diss him or choose sides and bet against him , now you 100% his oop !!! I think NBA shouldn’t take this seriously at all !!! NBA have fun with it , make a diss track and shut him up !!! Kendrick Lamar vs. Drake that Boy !!! 💯💯💯😎😎😎
This trash he wants to be be woke so bad now he's hating on a real one 😂🤣😂🤣
Cussing is a sin and mocking is a sin.
This fire he wrong for that at first I didn’t like it but me and my mom bumping this shii he wrong for doing yb like that 😮
His god is the devil
fire🔥🔥🔥
Ts so ah 😂 thought we got old nle to when i heard he dissed nba yb ts aint no diss no ly ts gotta stay in the studio
Hard nle but youngboy will not like it
Damm nle you had to do him like that😮 pls reply back nle to me
💎
No this is wild he called out the worst person you can call out
it’s crazy cause he can act like Muhammad Ali but he probably doesn’t know where he is from
Tupac remix is so creative
Fake boy do you like Michael Jackson?
“free youngboy” ain age well 😂😂
and he took the bullet for him 2:25...
Not to much on yb
Tuff watch
This is mad cringe 😂
1:22 NLJ
2pac would be proud of this
Hate him or love him..the guys got charisma, choreography and in tune with himself. I missed gangstas dancing lol
This shi ass😂
This video is hilarious. Idk what the beef is about but the dancing and expressions he's making😂
This one of the softest disses i ever heard
5000 SONG HITS AFTER HITS AFTER HITS TILL COMPLETE.ARTIST.PUSH PLAY
A little fruity for my liking.
Were old choppa
This sequence was so damn cold 1:22
But he was bumpin yb back in 2018 😹😹😹😹
Ko😂 NIA
Respect
Hell of a track, 1 just a good catchy song, 2 completely factual disses calling out shit that should be called out. Keep going NLE you just keep getting better at your craft homie, it’s nice to see your growth and in the right direction keep going!
I rebuke this in the name of Jesus.  The disrespect to our ancestors is real. The disrespect to your own mother. The disrespect of Jesus. You reap what you sow. Y'all are being manipulated and him.
This was definitely a humiliation ritual for NLE to join the Illuminati 😂😂😂 gone somewhere wit all that tangy choreography.
Bro made a whole film 🍿 🔥
Officially NLE STEPPA 😂😂😂😂
Lord, don’t let history repeat.. This is a little too intense
no bs, seeing clips on twitter i thought this track and video was trash.  but watching the whole thing, i respect the creativity, artistic effort and tbh the song not horrible
Lol..Can't hate on the creativity...Shout out NLE for this one..
Final. Warning listen to that
...
Bottom line nobody wants to hear this in the club!!! I think it’s annoying and it’s stupid. I don’t care about the message like they said you’re trying to be positive but threatening somebody at the same time. It looks like envy to me.
Put it on kick. Adin should put 100m on this one.
I believe this was made out of desperation being that he already knows that NBA is better than him so he tried to go a different route in hopes to make NBA look bad. If you decide to change, you can’t get mad and throw dirt on somebody else who’s has gained success from it . NLE change because he had to he wasn’t selling plus he  can’t even figure out who he wanna be. It’s really sad because I like him, but this made me look at him differently more in an envious way and that’s not good
NLE ate this 🔥💯
Umm. Dont ever disrespect 2pac . Its cool its a message but nooooo!
The amount of zesty in this vide is diabolical
He should have let Chris Brown write the diss
is it just me or does he sound like TuPac? Sounds just like hit em up Rip pac.
This actually a vibe 😭✌️
One of the best music videos I’ve seen in a while. 🔥🔥🔥
Wtf... When they talk too much about something, they don't know it like they should.
nah this is fire even tho im nine
Y’all say this is 🔥, but tell me one thing he said that was memorable? Exactly lol
Why is NLE chop a bald grow some hair back man I love your songs though
Its been 11 days and we still haven't heard from youngboy...... He's already dead😂😂😂😂😂
This not it.. butchering Tupacs Legacy lol
Tupac 🔥
Ko I love her music
Gay af
Creativity
🔥🔥🔥
What does MJ have to do with any of this 😂😂😂😂
This is the worst fucking shit I've ever seen and people who condone to this dumb shit need to be shot in front of a fire squad......
That was so got damn creative felt like i watched movie and it was a diss song btw i was enjoying myself like mf !!!
Aura give me the ecc
Fuh everybody saying it weird
I'm going for the NLE the Great
Yb better
Good song
Lay birdman the fuck down to split his wiggggggg have his towel wipe that shit up
Fake Michael Jackson fake 2Pac, fake king popstar the fact that you trying to be the king of popstar is not good bro like NLE you’re not him including NBA like have you seen better people rapping like you no and using them as example OK bro like who is you I mean your songs are good but when you release that, are you also disrespecting Michael Jackson and Tupac
KO
I love this video
Grande bösta
Gg bro nba bout to crash
How u gone start beef wit a nigga u spent your whole career trying to be? 🤔  This shit soft ash
Hardest beat I heard in my life
This is ass and the video is weird as fuck 😅 wtf
He really just saying YB leading the youth wrong
Huh
Choppa right tho...I can't stand YB's trash. But Choppa doing his flow is tough
First new rap song and video  I checked out in 2 or 3 years . Didn’t even know about this beef but young boy prob feeling like Bush when the 2nd tower was hit 😂😂😂
I promise NlE u waited 3yrs to diss back like nigga yb is not for u you do not wanna find out what 4KT can really do because u gonna be right there with von if u keep on playin
Ohh man, nice visuals man, keep it up.
The gayest shit i ever seen.
If Chris Brown crossed with Pac was a strain
I love the creativity!😊
He really embraced the spirit of Pacs hit em up n Michael Jackson’s thriller
Come to think of it I never seen a 🥷pop that gangsta ish n dance - I almost wanna say he the first to do it
He jealous of YB
that’s suppose to be yb head he carrying talk about going all out
Shii ass
“Maneeeeeeee downnnnnnnnnnn” 😂😂 shit fire 🔥
Idk why I find this song so dope 😶 dancing and all 😂
I disagree with everyone. I love everything about this. I love what he did with the beat. I love the way he deliver the words. I love LOVE the fashion. The dancing is better than Chris brown. Sorry not sorry. I haven't seen a music video this good in a while. I think this man is talented.
2PAC has risen from da dead
The genius...the art...the symbolism...the message...this is hands down top tier
Oh, maaaan 🔥🔥🔥
Those floors
He’s too creative
Say what ya want about NLE but boy is talented
I couldnt hear a word of what hes saying. Is it just me? 🫤
Ko
The visual art is 1000 times better than the lyrics
hit em up but in 2025
Frfr someone had to call him out cause all he do is preach murder beef…the youth in my country steady murdering each under YB name…
Thank you NLE for awakening prime Yb... Top coming for u ass! 😈
Black House Sounds Motley
Woo 6.1m view in 10 days.
This is when you get destroyed by a boat ballerina😂😂 chopper you really destroyed him, no doubt but with a smile
Went crazy crazy 🔥
Shit kinda hard 😞
Now this is art. 🖼️
This boi lame wasn’t he trying to be like young boy at 1st
The fact that you got South African flag I salute you.  no DNA ITS RSA🎉❤
3:41 was crazy bro, holding bro’s head
They figured it out touch SA and go viral😭
This is the first time Ive seen and heard of any of NLE, at 40 I don't have time to hear the same ish I have been listening to since the 90s, this was dope and creative.
WHAT DF IS DISSSSSS😂 AND WHAT IT GOTTA DO WITH YOUNGBOY?????
NLE > Youngboy
First time I've seen NLE go outside his comfort zone and honestly it's great this is what we need more of this creativity and less thugs who think they're special but really just the next victim. A statistic is all you are yet you here hating on the next man lmfao. If your not creative and are stuck on the street corner don't speak on it lil bro you still ain't made it out u stagnant. Feel it.
NLE: 1 YB: 0
Video is crazy but I low-key fuck with the song especially the chorus
NLE-Much love from both your Ugandan & SouthAfrican fans! 🇺🇬🇿🇦✊🏿🔥
Bro! Since when did nle wake the fuck up lmao. I fuck with dude but this was his masterpiece. Fuckin smashed it
his style is always so smooth but has the roughness that feels hard as hell still
That is ridiculous to call that music.  SMH.
You know you wore that red outfit for  me 😸💅🏾
This a crazy level up
4:00 w
South African flag siyabonga.
Idc what anyone says NLE been that. And this took it to the next level.
I cant
Ya cant tell me this aint giving off Lil Nas gay vibes 😂
Yo this is 🔥finally another war in rap
This is acc really good. 😮
Shit still hard😂🔥🔥🔥
Honestly, this diss is so fkin tuff bro
Bringing the 🪒 bicced heads back 🤎
Keep the beef on studio, don''t let yourself lack! nle! yb!
NLE was a good 🥷.
“ I grew up bumping him, couldn’t dream of him just hating on me” Prime example of why you don’t idolize these superstars and celebrities, wasn’t there a video of NLE back when he was in high school saying YoungBoy was his favorite rapper. Now we get the most random-out of nowhere diss 10 years later, I can’t lie song is hard 🔥 but where was this response when Top said, “I see a new hat Nigga with a blue flag”
Who do you think you are?
Bro young boi is just too big for u to make a dent uts simply his time... respect it and fall down
This music is garbage. But video is good very entertaining. Great visuals amazing creativity. BUT MUSIC IS COMPLETELY GARBAGE.
This video is so 😈
This is so fire!
Perfect shots for @youngboy
Quality, Creativity and entertainment at it's best ❤Bro cooked
Tupac Jackson 🤷🏽‍♂️😂😂🔥
Fire 🆓🆓💨💨💨
The song is decent the video is 🏳️‍🌈
Alors même si je comprends pas pourquoi tu l’as clashé, je dois avouer que le clip est très créatif et artistique ! Joli travail et bel effort ! 😩❤️
that was so buns..😓😓 #4ktrey4ever
Boooooooooooooooo
The lyrics amazing it was the video I know you were artist and I know you love the arts, but that shit was all over the place but I get what you’re saying. It’s time to get those type of people out of our community big props.
*I CAN'T WITH THE MICHEL JACKSON DANCES/DANCE MOVES!* This is pretty great though *AND THE WALMART VERSION OF YOUNG BOY😭🖐🏾*
My boy a whole clown. Clapped back with memes.
He better be on that fr he know jit ain't playin no games
This is dark ngl
Bruh literally did YB dance in the video and was HEAVY YB fan.. where did this beef come from? I think the visuals was overstimulating for the message
If yall dont get it let me put you on game. Hes taking the kendrick method “be corny to appeal to the whypeepoh and casual listeners in order to get them to say “f young boy”. But its a big flop this isnt good/catchy enough to get tech nerds in on an internet beef bruh 😂.
Lol bro new 2pac
YB Diss
Outside of great visualizes … bro is blabbering 😂😂😂 …
Best song
This hard
Dope visuals I won't lie for a Hip Hop video
SONG IS ZESTY TRASH

Você não é o 2pac bro

What's our flag and Ugandan flag doing there? 😂😂😂
2:32 I’m screaming the PAC and Mj Vibe
Youngboy really can’t rap like this, bro is buns. All he can rap about is murder & his 50 bm’s it’s clear who will win this lyrically. If you choose nba you have room temp ahh iq 😂
Youngboy fans can’t except the truth
🇿🇦🇺🇬🫡
Rip Da Real Gee Money❤
This the best song I’ve heard in along ass time bro! I told you God Got you Bro! I Told ya!
“Gayyyyo. gayyyyyo. I’m booty-e-I-o. Don’t stop when it’s hurtin.”
It's always impressive how young and talented NLE is. He's been around for years and only 23.   This was very creative and although people may not like the messenger...the rap was very outstanding.  I don't even listen to rap often but every once in awhile I find myself impressed by this young man's talent , creativity, and the life changes he's not afraid to make in front of everyone. What a unique individual. Claps to you
South Africa represent ❤🎉
Definitely hit a nerve with this one class
This why Chris brown got clapped on stomp the yard😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Damn bro this goes haaaard too much to point out but even the director, lighting, camera man and the one who makes it complete the editor killed the visuals

Awesome video! Original and the message is loud and clear.. He got some of the old Gs spirits coming through in his aura on this one….Chop they head off Choppa🙏🏽❤️
NLE really an artist. Not just a rapper or entertainer. All the above
I Want To See These Two Duke It Out With A Old Fashion Fight! They Both In The Same Weight Class 😂. But I Think NLE MIGHT GET YB IN A BOXING 🥊 MATCH FIGHT 😅. BUT FAR AS THE STREETS, YB GOT U BEAT BUDDY. IF YOU NOT A STREET NINJA, STAY OUT THE WAY, AND DON'T GET CAUGHT UP IN SOMETHING YOU CAN'T TAKE THE HEAT FOR. STAY SAFE O🙏🏿U🙏🏿T THERE!!!
Ain’t no Pac. Just cringe. And that voice??!!
all you pussc ah nihs talking bout he js bought the chain for the vid but if you got to his song call step you would see he had that shi long time ago and yall know how many time nba youngoy dissed him and this his 2nd diss the first one was sleazy flow

This shit buns
Yahweh sent me to reap him ✝️🙌🏻Jesus is Yahweh ,keep studying nle
🎉🎉🎉🎉
This is trash 🗑️
I miss 90s rappers with everything it was the golden era  This tiktok gangster dance musical you can keep
WTF is this
This wack ass shit
For with God nothing shall be impossible. Luke 1:37 KJV
So nobody heard him, saying “yeweh” when the video first started, this video means something
Nle
Ko
This is not tuff🥀🥀🥀🥀😔😔✌🏼
Fvck the video he definitely did his thing with the lyrics
Zesty ass music video
I F with this heavily. I don’t listen to NLE much but this caught my attention. It’s reminiscent of Tupac.
😨
Great awesome
I love it
Aint gone lie just from the music visual alone I love this
Mannnn wtf is this🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤣🤣
HARD!   90s baby, in my early thirties and a huge music lover...this gave me the chills. I'm uninterested in his  smoke with YB, my 23 year old brother may be, but this right here NIGGA.  Bow Down. Give respect when it's due. This was sensational and embodied all the greats in a modern, respectful way.   Keep doing you. I aint mad at you.  -True Phenomenon
Peep the checkerboard ☹️
Guaranteed to be Timeless ❤️
Watch nba youngboy do some crash out music to respond back
This sh is whack
It would be way better if he didn’t have the lame dancing stuff this makes me think he is just clowning for clicks nbayoungboy is probably part of it none of them have put out a banger song so it’s a Collab so they get big again
Steal bars and tryna do his grin? Boy get your own flavor🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Clean up on isle trey was the disrespect
This is some hot trash on my soul
Its the queer version ok hit em up ahahaha
Best song
Whole time he’s the puppet .video creativity tells it all , the checkerboard Floors , clothing . Are u tupac or jackson?
He went PLAT
Good Song But I Feel The Video Should’ve Just Been Him Rapping Not All This Extra Stuff
NleTheGreat giving me 2pac vibes somehow.
something about bald heads, dissing other rappers and this particular sample
He letting that Tupac role get to him. He gotta find himself.  Forget the attention
The hottest dis out rt now🔥🔥🔥NBA youngboy not ready😅
Ko
prime nle might be back
He’s saying YAHWEH. And The MOST HIGH, But Dissing someone created in his IMAGE. he’s JUST as LOST as Youngboy is. This is called HYPOCRISY. Hopefully they both SURRENDER their lives to JESUS and Be FILLED with The Holy Spirit.🙏🤍🕊️🕊️🕊️ JESUS IS COMING SOON.
Holy fuckin shit dis is da worst thing I have heard in along time why did you even release ts wtf
Nah. This is substance
He think he Michael Jackson
This is corny to me idk why
Boy want to be everybody but he self
I don’t get why this has 10M views in 10 days. His voice gets boring half way through. Like, you gunna switch it up or..?
That shits ass as fuck bruhh🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
2pac wouldn’t pass this bs he pull right up on you like wtf
Now this right here was straight hot trash 🗑️ zesty ass dancing too😂

I low-key like it cause he’s trying to act like Michael Jackson
Give af about how u treat yo body give af about yo cleaning -YB
Amazing video
Ts so tuff im glad he changed
Pretending to be people your not is lame. If he was so godly why didn't he pretend to be Jesus and just pray for him instead prey on him. Don't be fooled sheep
Can somebody enlighten me on why he even dissed yb?
This is ass. He doing everything for clout. He trynna be everybody but himself. No identity clearly. Lol YB don't even got to respond
Im happy knowing you changed your name to nle the great because you really are great. God bless you nle 🙏
🇺🇬 10/11/2025
This is art, well done
I dont listrn to most of deez lil punks music BUT THIS ......BUT NINJA THISSSS HAS GOT TO BE THE FRUITIST VIDEO IVE EVER SEEN. HE SMACKING A DUDE ON HIS BOTTOM......just stop rapping bangN or whatever you doin....it aint working for you. You just killed and stamped your used to be career😂😂😂😂😂Just change you name to Lil Fruit ball😂😂😂😅😅😅
Whew he ate this down 😂😂😂
3rd verse was amazing, blew me away how deep he got w/ the spiritual battle aspect of it all. Way I see disses sometimes is it's not out of hatred for the person but the misuse of their gift/talent and someone calling them into correction.
⛽️⛽️⛽️⛽️
Ko a disstrack on nbayoung boy crazy song nle
I’m a youngboy fan, and let me just say, this song is so fucking bad and this nigga is so mentally ill, I actually fw it
This is fcking creative wtf 😂😂😂😂
This shhh  was Hard
This is hardest shtt ive heard in a while and im 90s 2000 era. He stepped it up.not much nba can do to beat this hence no response yet.hel have to go deep in his bag. Hel still lose. Good vs evil imo.  Nle is in godmode
this shits ass brh wth 😂😂😂😂
I'm the only one Who gives him vibes like was listening the old school NLE hard ass fuck no cap
Bro could've kept this
I came here bc I saw ppl dragging him on twitter but to my great surprise?!? this is the most creative I’ve seen a male rapper or male artist period in a while

2:31 Tupac / outlaws nle choppa outlaws outfit
Welp RIP Mr.potts 😂
What he meant was the industry is  is poisoning OUR youth black kids and it’s the truth  And he did a lot in this video to show how Michael Jackson and pac and a few others got killed for telling us the truth and the ones that don’t get killed are the ones that will help KILL us and keep us hating each other and he pointed out nba because of what NBA talks about in his lyrics
Wtf, this is why they never change coz this is just weird
This song inspired me to write diss songs about pootie tang for that time he sined my pitty on the runny kine! KO,KO like…
He said he was going to unalive Yb an yall praising.. He promoting violence too. This shyt ahhh aff be fr
Checkerboard floor… the industry is pushing this beef between them.
DAMNNNNNM 🙌🏻
He needs to go back to the rap that he did 4 years ago
Killed it cuz

I love the arts 😅
Whole video just awkward AF. He isn’t built for these type of videos. XG has better bars AND videos and they are little K-Pop chicks. There is a reason Rap isn’t on the top 40 right now.

This joint tough and silly Af at the same time 😂
He just killed Young Boy this is literally the K.O 🔥 idc what nba fans say he couldn't do this 🎉never!!!
HE AIN FAKING ❤
I like what bro tryna do...  Spiritual warfare ✨... It's definitely the time .. cause YB is literally who the industry chose to reset the generation.. YB said it himself that he realizes he's detrimental to the youth and he regrets it .. but he's still doing it cause he's under contract.. he could easily wake and rewire this generation to do better, but instead, he's continuing the agenda. Only thing I dont  like, is chop speaking too soon... Chop pushed 304 energy, Steppers and violence too.... YB just got back and we haven't had a chance to see his maturity yet... Because songs like  "FINEST"  "FU** THE DRUGS" "IM READY"  is clearly YB otherside tryna shine.. but this "BEEF" will ONLY Feed YB Dark side.. it's always when you seek to change, that your past works harder to remind you.. I wanna see more of this by NLE... But not just to target or tether the biggest wave at the time and moment.. NLE onto something, it's just something we haven't seen in awhile..  NLE playing chess ♟️... He going deeper than rap..
NO VOODOO PRAYERS!!!!
1:43 WHO GOT THIS NIGGA SO MAD LMFAO
A Knock Out without a 9 day row diss...even a nine week or a nine weak week haHAA!!!
Call him what you want, say what you want, he stomped all over this track. Its smooth.
This shit trash😂😂😂😂😂😂
🇺🇬?
Creative remixing don’t look any further into your own song
Meet up and die
Bushit and fruity
Diddy disciple
i think the song go hard but nle be careful
You are my favorite rapper. I hate NBA YoungBoy. I hate him for killing my favorite rap by other favorite rapper. King Von I love y’all RIP von
Who miss old nle
Hard bro
This was ridiculously creative. The message, the delivery, the tribute to black people.. to our culture.. he really speaking different right now. This came from his heart, and he isnt coming to violence. This is a "Ard, thats what you on? Imma meet you where you at, maybe you'll hear me then" Its goofy on its surface.. but when you really listen... this isn't violence. This is a black man speaking to another. Tryna change the image of the black man. He fighting his demons. And his demons look just like him... like... this is DEEP bruh.
Soft as Charmin 🎉
How the hell do you respond to a diss like this 😂😂 #CheckMate #KO
NLE got in the gym and the booth for this one.

Fire
This sound like hit em up by 2pac
Not Evan gonna lie what is happening
🎬 ER4U Review: NLE Choppa – OK  NLE Choppa’s new “OK” is a wild balance between beauty and madness. On one hand, it’s a brilliant tribute to the legends. On the other, it almost plays like a parody, with this mix of feminine energy and raw chaos. But artistically—it’s fascinating. You can feel every emotion clash and connect like a creative storm that only he could pull off.  If art is meant to be expressive, then he truly expressed himself in his own way. Everyone will have their own interpretation, but I think he accomplished exactly what he set out to do. I’m not even talking about the beef or the drama—I’m talking about the art itself. It may not be for everyone, but you can’t deny the passion and effort he poured into it.  Honestly, this was one of the best music videos I’ve seen in a while. Some parts might not be for me, but everything felt intentional—like NLE Choppa knew exactly what he wanted to create, and he made it happen. It’s bold, expressive, and true to his vision—and that’s something I can respect. 🎭🔥  #NLEChoppa #OK #MusicVideo #HipHopArt #CreativeVision #VisualStorytelling #ER4UReview #MusicDiscussion #Artistry
This crazyy.

thanks for this now the king finna drop sum lengendary
I was entertained to so the least.  It was a lot of negatives being tossed around about this video, but watching it for myself it wasn’t as bad as people was saying.
Valid diss track🇿🇦 approved
THE CRAZY PART IS IF KING VON WAS STILL ALIVE THIS DISS WOULDN'T EXIST. CAUSE NLE WAS FRIENDS WITH KING VON  AND KING VON RAPPED ABOUT THE SAME THING..
this shit so strange and I cant nake sense of it but his weird Lil gestures and bizarre wardrobe got me watching this again...whole thing is absurd and peculiar but interesting. trying to make sense of all of it
This is a weird dude, but this is beyond creative. And that roll out with the clips was marketing genius.
My boy already diss this lame boy ’hi hater’
So we just going to forget that he shot his bm house up??
So everybody hate yb now?
Is that a Uganda flag?
Video clip dance ghost music Michael Jackson tribute etern
Ngl this catchy 😂😂😂😂
Whoever tho it mixing Mike Jackson Tupac Tyson and Ali would make this
Yall not hearing me this got so many gems and he spitting real shit a lot going over yalls head
Never diss my glorious king again
Is this the “black culture” I keep hearing about 😂 embarrassing
this the kind of guy kat williams warned about
Yall crazy as hell. This isn't creative,  its just weird.
The greatest diss track ever
Nle is on his tupac arc
This creative and kinda catchy, but it’s corny. Nothing truly that original. And he’s beefing with YB cuz he’s a bad influence, yet dude is threatening violence? Doesn’t make any sense lol
SHOUT OUT NLE DONE BEEN TIRED OF NBA YOUNGBOY FR THIS IS GOOD VS EVIL FRFR
This video crazy man
he done started a war na😂😂ts never finna end everybody hide
mane hnnn
I guess I'll explain all the symbolism... The dancing was cringe
2 pac/ Michael Jackson
I think this level of trolling is actually genius... On some Soulja Boy type shxt. In fact Soulja Boy must be proud
🔥🔥💯
Masonic floor flow. They got him
Hey ball head
He right look at YB fans lost and a danger to society
I think bruh just be wanting excuses to be gay
Don't pretend Satan isn't your God too
Role model you will never fit the shoe💨💨💨💨

NLE transformation is for real🎉
Yep
I love it plus the creativity of this video is 🔥🔥 NLE choppa  you did that 👏🏾 🙌🏾 💪🏾🫶🏿💜
The "hit em up" sample sounds crazy
Box it out
Wasn’t a fan before 😂. This is the new slap for disses ! He won .
It's creative I can say
This nigga was spittin 😂
Pretty cool concept
I love the diss track let’s just pray the message comes across and it stays in the studio.
Shit
You should’ve played OK cause you’re scared dumb dumb
2pac vs biggie
Bro has to put up posters and do all this shii js to barley pass 5 mill views and youngboy can literally sing his abcs and get 30 million views. Look at youngboys song f*ck the industry pt 2 at 58 seconds in he says “you don’t compare to me and never up in life we could compete”
*Winchester doesn’t make a copper…*
Horrible song just horrible
I know this ain’t towards young boy😂😂😂😂
hell
This shit is trash
Please tell me this a AI video 😂
Bro made a movie for his ... I don't really listen to bro music or know what the beef is but no lie the imagery in this is 🔥🔥🔥
Cause telling kids get yo gooch licked ain’t poisonous 💀? “Is saying you keep that ratchet like tennis “”? Helping the youth if nle was real he woulda dissed whole industry the whole industry poisoning but he choose yb for a pay day
Birdman got NBA yb calling him Daddy he gonna do him just like he did Lil Wayne
Not bad nice video it's okay to think outside the box!
I’m praying for nle ( pls nba spare him he has a kid) 😢
SA FLAG  WE PROUD OF YA NLE ❤❤🇿🇦🇿🇦
Hate it or love it, this some artistry.  I f wit it
everytime NLE channels pac it goes hard
Young boy fanna get yo ass
"embraced my light and my dark"
NLE trash NBA way better
Is ts a musical film or rap 😭
This video was 🔥  Creative asf.
wow I'm impressed I love his creativity
I feel like this makes Michael Jackson into it because he’s dressed up as Michael Jackson. This sounds so good but like I think he’s like trying to like stand up for a von and that young boy is praising the devil, but like my opinion, this song SmackDown
NLE yu just look stupid gang yn better
5.8m
Yeah, he’s part of the illuminati now because if you look at it in the background, he’s just like a homosexual with the shirt on and then also with that checker checkerboard floor
Ok the big picture got it. I guess the small picture is the checkerboard pattern which is symbolic of evil is ok. Cool
U talking all dat 2 yb and still haven't did anything he isn't worried about u
YB will do yo ass
U used 2 be a fan
YB will bya
didnt heared "hit em up" for a long time need to listen to it again thank u for the beat RIP legend
Yb on top
YB betterdt

You used to love nba
Let’s gooooo🤫🤫🤐🤐😶😶
😮😮😮😮 why do i like this so much?! I like nba young boy but i like this too hahaha. I love creative beef . Leave it on wax though
He is so creative and I love it !!!
bro u been saying he dont got aura but u js sayed his aura sicks me
SA and UG flags
There is no response to this lyrically from YB!! There isnt one song in his catalog that can top this in my opinion. ( In fairness, I dont listen to neither's music, this song and video is just fucking clever)
NLE ❤️ LLKV 🕊️
Much I try to listen to this I just  can't cause it's him trying to act hard knowing he not 😂😂😂
Rip von
looking at the devil like this is your king
Look at all these fake comments y’all, hit newest and start scrolling and laughing 😂😂😂 imagine believing ts Hard .. ain’t no way these gotta be BOTS😂😂😂😂
SMASH🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥THE MOST CREATIVE VIDEO AND SONG I HAVE HEARD IN A LONG TIME...

1:56 Blow the head off ya neck like a Dandelion-😂
Any Ugandan here....big up   to NLE for raising our flag up...one love CHOPPER
Ain’t gon lie to ya, but nle snapped
It’s nice to see a well produced video. This reminds me of videos from the 90’s
Big Diss
The end was pretty insane
The moonwalk
I want old nle Choppa back he USED to be my favorite rapper now he's not
Bro cooked with the song,but yb is gonna make a banger

Video is interesting but the song is not good.
🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
Bro combined 3 legends to diss NBA YoungBoy...
I don’t see him acting like pac or sounding like him this flow different and hard sound like slave rap mixed sinners the movie blues then mixed with a gambino show but the voice is unique
Tupac - Hit em up??? " FYI - Tupac said he wants his song back
He putting nba on game , nva a crash out dummy . Think money fame  and guns gets him respect . But it was a fake image you hides what really neath
Um. This shit is tough. Probably the most unique thing ive seen in rap for YEARS.
What the fuck is this shit. Man this is terrible
What the hell is all that dancing for ? 😂 and why did this joker go bald
Mannnn thats a banger
We need shotta flow 8
Sold His Soul. Look at the Hand signs. Masonic checkerboard.... Bro gave his Soul away
🇿🇦anyone
Tell him that he just a rapper and a better dad nothing more, but he keep saying his more 😅 Kentrell 👎🏼
Deathrow vs Birdman? damn that's fire !!!!
Been seeing clips all over the socials, decided to actually give the video a view. Glad I did. I don’t even fuk with NLE like that. Everyone screaming “Message” I mean, I get it I really do. SOME bars come off as a message, most of the bars are just “diss-diss-how imma ☠️ or beat ya to a pulp” 🤷🏿‍♂️ however, the music video and the creativeness behind it is gold 💪🏾 the work he crafted behind this can’t not go unnoticed. I ain’t invested in any homo rumors, it is what it is, but homie can dance it seems and he utilized that skill in his video, can’t hate the man. Will I listen to this regularly? Naw. Will I add it to a playlist? Naw. But I will give credit when it’s due, good shit NlE
Is this boy a Michael Jackson’s 😊 coz this nah rap anymore 😅😅😂
Can someone explain to me why he is dancing like Mike Jackson in a dis video please? I’m 37 and obviously don’t understand anymore 😔😂
Ko
This is kinda strange vibes but I respect the effort and the professionalism of him being an entertainer
🍑🍑🍑 Aaaasssssssssss
Little killer ❤❤❤
❤❤
Pay attention to what he is saying
Gay boss
Straight up knock out 😵
Yb better🗑️
Nle from the burbs young boy from the slums it’s not even 2 artist that should be beefing. 2 nle first hit is shotta flow he started his career jacking nba vibe idk it’s a dumb to me. Feel like nle using nba for clout Even by dissing him
Choppa Stands on buisness , LLVon
I wish bro had something original about him
This bangs
Good song
NBA check calling song is fire
Tupac would have loved this after yb tour I will be expecting a response should have been less than 24 tho  # Keep it hip hop!!
This guy is a woke weirdo. Gay video.
The last verse the best Bars I’ve ever heard from him 💯💯💯💯
mannn. i hope im more wrong than i ever have been, but i kan feel the tears in my eyes already. hes bucking, they dnt let artists get away with things like this. yaw seen the images he portrayed in the video. and watch his interview about his new found mind power. hes now a threat. im not tellin u what someone told me, im telling you what i know. we love u NLE. the conscious mind is growing, some of us have been called and it cant be ignored...this is jus the start. evil is powerful, seems good isnt existant..its chess not checkers, its not even a game..soldiers are responding to serve the Universe which is us as a collective, its been written, we know who wins. choose the right side, which is yourself! break barriers, gain new found mental power. keep leading Choppa! jus gettin started!
Lmao 😂
It’s literally the representation of good vs evil . The white side knocking out the red and overcoming evil . The sinister red scenes that are talking to YB showing the world he’s a puppet . Paying homage to Michael who kept trying to reveal the industry’s motives in his music. Dancing on the checker floor. Then showing black representation and how we’ve been enslaved and are still slaves to the industry & the system but instead of having us in the fields we’re still doing the dirty work and instead of letting them kill us we’re killing each other and poisoning ourselves and our youth before they have a chance.
K o. K o. Hmm, voo d-I-0. Yehwah boom bay ye😂😂😂 boy said (god kill him)😂😂
2 pac vibe
This ate down. Imma be playing this for a min🤣
wannabe fake rapper trash u ruined an amzing song 2 make fake rapper money
3:00 minutes he look a little &@y
Hate to say it, but NLE bodied him🔥🔥
Is this man trying to talk tough and dance like a homosexual at the same time this shit is crazy when I was a kid in the 90s if I would’ve saw this on TV with immediately thought this dude is gay as fuck
I am a minute and 19 seconds into this weird ass shit and my mind is like what the fuck what is this garbage? This nigga super weird might be weirder than Lil Nas X just because he actually thinks he’s tough to.
The video is creative but the the actual song is kinda corny ngl
I like it 😅😂😂
South african flag is awesome🎉
Goofball
This is one of the gayest things I've ever seen
This is so goood 🎉🎉😊

“You poisoning the youth” also NLE: says ninja, talks about gangsters etc.
Nle always goes hard and he doesn't Mumble like a worthless piece of trash. YB literally makes random noises on Auto-Tune and all these dumbass primates say it "so hard" NLE top tier for real
Thank you for awakening yb ❤🙏

Creative
I wont lie i ran this back multiple times this was 🔥
NLE tough
I blame makaveli
Bruh say what you want… sometimes this music sht get boring.. but anything creative like this gets a A+ .. that ngga trippin… but it’s dope tho
6 million in 9 days….. with the amount of money that is behind this song has got to be the biggest loss of this last quarter for His label 😂😂😂😂😂
Checkerboard showing this something deep. Good Mason (white square) vs Bad Mason (Black Square) I think Youngboy time running up because he’s getting older and audience changing he can’t be Youngboy forever so they sent NLE to start it up
Boi, the way, i've been jamming on this shit😅
NBA youngboy can’t compete😂😂😂😂
We are witnessing an evolution of a drill rapper into a proper rapper. Its great to see someone transitioning in a good way.
Damn this shit hit different
Greatful for yb, he brought back prime nle and better🔥
If you cross that line ,  don't step any further. 🎉
May this beef not be in the streets like drake vs kendrick
These shit is wack and moist lol
Vibes good take YB off the Earth
This is real creative.  But why they beefing
People don't listen to music anymore. This man is a child of God. Everyone is too focused on trying to paint a false narrative. He's speaking on YB's negative influence on the youthful masses, and being the devil's pawn. Look at the people he's portraying. Michael Jackson, Muhammad Ali, Tupac...these are people that had positive influence and real messages for people to grasp. It's deeper than what everybody on social media can comprehend.
If there's ever a micheal jackson tv show to pay homage...NLE should play the part
He can move, choreography was great!
Trash 😂😅😂😅
Finally an artist enjoying his art!!! Great AD!!
So we dont see the black and white checkerboard floors?
This is some Zesty 💩 Disrespect to Pac and Ali
Tupac finna come back from Cuba and whoop yo ass using his beat for some bullsh…
This shit raw A+ for creativity and that shxt gave old skool I love old skool
Chris Brown’s got some competition after this one😵🔫🤧🤧🫣🫣🫣🫣
He isn't on yb level dont know why he dissing him i like nle but come on now bro he's mad zesty to
Ever seen a gangster stomp the yard Nah so you ain't one😂
This shit fire nle keep tat shii coming 💕
I like it! I’m officially a fan.
Wtf smh
Absolutely amazing! I love the creativity ...he's different
YB not finna respond to this shit bro 😂
Dang comments on here are way more positive than on other platforms. I like it.
why does bro look like a bald youngboy 😭😭😭
I know it says "ko" ...😂why does it sound like "gay yo"
I hope god keep him safe
Dope thing
🗑 🚮
Will will will 😮😮❤
I don't even like him that much but this was really dope.
Video Funny 😂😂😂
This a long parody 😭😭😭
LET'S GOOO 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man what an evolution. Broh this is fire 🔥

Bots 🤖 all in the comments 🤣
The elites generated this no way he had funds for this
What the fuck is this
This was lit! I don't even listen to this type of music anymore,  but i cut for this big time. 🔥
Idc what yall say this shit was hard as hell😊 the video made it 90x better
2 pac would not fw dude
Why bald 😢
Is you really bald tho
Hit em up beat😋
I can't lie, I enjoyed the video. Very creative and I understood the references and the message. Not a NLE fan but he thought out the box and it worked.
Ether Bomb of 2025
They got him that's why he bald now
Bro wtf did I just watch 😂😂
Genius.
Kinda feels like a mixture of 2pac and Ice cube in his prime
After the Humiliation ritual yeaaaaahhhh makes sense….if you Knowles then you Knowles
Bro really different
🌽🌽🌽
Micheal Jackson Tupac and Ali all are turning in their graves because of this monkey ball bullshit
I’m starting to see it now fr , this mf a banger fr , and he’s an artist so the visual and shit was creative af !
People know this was raw just immediate  🔥🔥 NLE really him & I see the vision in the video my guy💯

3:41 is crazy
This shit ass n corny leave tupac out of it
This is literally the first song worthy of replay that ANY of these fuckin acronym-at-the-first-of-they-name ass niggas have made since they started doing that dumb shit. YSL NLE NBA OTF ABC XYZ FBI ATF CIA DNA AARP BRB TGIF TTYL BBQ BBL NFL MLB FIFA ESPN USPS DHL GIF PDF JPEG FYI WWE NWO DMV ROTFLMFAO WD40 A&W AT&T ESPN HBO CNN TLC KFC NAACP. Any rapper, any city,  any state, any acronym... they've all fucking sucked. But I heard I should listen to this so I did. They were right, I'm impressed. 8 out of 10 song. 44 out of 10 video.
Bruh leave Tupac alone this shit is ass  I like the outfits though prince mj and Tupac but how is this a diss track 😂
Nahh this is hard!🔥🔥
This song so ah

Crazy how NLE can imitate someone's movement..
Good song but it's a lot going on in this video
This shit is cringe…
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Very creative, reminds me of the videos from back in the day…better than just standing there with a mic and 50 dudes behind you.
Tupac 2025 version. You all know Tupac was gay AF

Why the beefing ?
NLE I HOPE YOU READ THIS TO.   MY people NLE is a gay rapper just like NBA. Both are apart of the same trade and agenda, NBA youngboy not even gonna take him seriously 😐 because they both house demons in the same temple of shame & destruction. NLE has this obsession with 2Pac he wants to channel that powerful energy that he can never be. NLE is a fake gangster ruled by his puppet masters a joke.
How is he dancing saying these words it's weird and the pants are strange
Next Ye.. talking craziness
Nah this shit weak 😂😂😂
😎
That’s crazy if YoungBoy got some better to fire back with it gotta be better than this. It has to be better than this matter fact can’t be better than this this, this is the best thing this track I ever heard that’s crazy. That’s just crazy like bro young boy, I don’t know how you gonna fire back but you better do it cause he just smoked you.
The hit em up sample lowkey smack
NLE a homothug
This did go in
2pac turned in his grave hearing this come out
Listen. I have never listened to an NLE song. Not fully. May have heard a clip here and there. I love this, I love this video. This was creative and I don’t see one ass shaking.
Nahhh dis tuff 🔥🔥🔥
Just a pawn 😢
What a smooth criminal!!

NLE🫣🤭😂🔥🎶
Oh shit it's Chris brown, it's Chris breezyy
Ko ko ko Jesus is the greatest ❤
Spiritual warfare is we fight the devil and his demons w the name of Jesus rebuke him and he will flee. Stay on the narrow path we not perfect when u slipping and moving on that wide path get back to  Our father who art in Heaven. Read Book of Palms and Matthew to see how Jesus preached walked and lived how on a mountain tempted he used scriptures and the devil ran. We been given authority over principalities of darkness we don’t fight humans bro praying for you ❤ prayers are up

YB BETTER
Only here because of von🙏 How can u diss someone with a full out Michael Jackson video😑
Both are clowns... YB actually makes decent music, but ultimately they are both goofy little boys
Man. DOWN
I hope they doing this for entertainment purposes it’s pointless I really think in NLE is NBA secret Brother and they’re trying to make a bag
He is a Satan worshipper just like his owner Jay z and the whole rock nation  ...God please hurry.
Video is top tier  Song is meh
After careful consideration. I don't like my hip hop choreographed 😂.

Well done 👍🏾. Finally artistry and talent 💯 👏🏾
Yo you did excellent. This is fr one of the best if not the best rap video ever for me

2pac 1:42🙂‍↕️🫡❤️❤❤❤❤
Fuh young boy
Awesome video
That boy gay
Being 46 years old and growing up with most of the era portrayed in this video at first I was like "oh hell naw" what is this. But the more I watched and really listened to the lyrics and message of the song. This is deep. It seems  NLE connected with God rn. "IF THE LORD IS WITH ME THEN WHO CAN EVER BE AGAINST ME " 😎😬🙏💪💯
❤❤❤❤❤

wishyouwas16
its offical. 2PAC is REINCARNATED!!! MAKAVELI LIVES IN NLE!!
Free mason floors 😂 all these artist are puppets
All you boys talking about this being about beef or a diss, clearly dont see the bigger picture. This is about man-childs poisoning the youth and making kids think ungodly. You cross that line and mess with the future generations and you'll see got take a stand. You boys make me sick, and feel disappointed because of what you see and dont see. Trying to act like alpha males that only see money, kitties, and power. Keep going god will devour and make you burn and scream louder, till you're nothing but powder. Ha coward.
Bro is dissing his inspiration💀🥀
Yaa he might jus die after dis one
This shit is 🔥🔥🔥🌤️🔥🔥🔥🔥
SCP NLE☠️
Who side yall on
Rip to yb because nle already sent him to God
The goat is back :)

Trash
Kate with all due respect how can I stalk a six foot five linebacker I write all my bars ask fifty n ye ur problem started with ur dog 🐶 and ended with the A wide gap u couldn’t keep close stop stalking me and move on
nobody gon admit he was killing him on this
What is this?
This was very creative and he didn’t lie not once
NLE The Great will always keep throwin viral  because of his voice.    he is byin vews  fram 💖💖 HIPVIEWS DAWT CAWM 💖💖
Shits weak af my boy...
yall nle and yb are beefing for so much longer btw
Creativity out the roof 👏🏻
Dam this nigga is giving nba sleepless night's on this😂😂
Never seen a rapper rebrand his whole image like this. I've always thought NLE was a good rapper, but not necessarily someone pushing rap in new directions. Now im sitting here wondering what hes gonna do next. This is exciting as hell to watch.
💙💜❤️‍🔥 QUENCH 🚫
Ain't gonna lie this is hard
DAMMMM COOKTTTTTTTTT NLEEEEEEEEE 🐐 GOAT KOOOOOOOO!!!!! RIP KING VON
Proud of Choppa for this one
THE SPIRIT OF REAL RAP LIVES.  A MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE. BLACK PEOPLE NEWS AND BROADCASTING. Rap is back. Kendrick
Ultra zesty behavior
I like this  song  because  my  dad is  from  ko
this has some troublesome vibes like 2pac
KOKO🎉🎉🎉🎉
Yb didn’t respond because yb is richer than him
He needed to have the masonic floor in the video
Respect fr I really like this track this is great work NLE 💯 💯 fire 😮🔥 🔥
We are all here witnessing history
Nah this is actually good its creative and different not my style but the video lit tho ngl✅️
Ass
i know what u dissing up, not even yb it self, its the music industry, long life nle🥺
Nbayoungboy better
nba still on top 😂
Its huntin season, on the wall, we’re head huntin souvenirs 🥶
That’s why King Von died
NBA YoungBoy on top
This is literally the best song that's been out in the last 30 years. The only person who ever put stuff out like this is Tupac.
He Destroyed young boy with this. And we all know now that he's with God and on the right side of history. Young boy is with the devil. That's why young boy's mom is so mad because she's seen this and got mad that she can't look at her own son and be proud like that. Cause her son contributes nothing to society but destruction. NLE Mama see this and is The proudest mom on earth. This boy is in his Tupac Kendrick bag right now. And I hope he stays in it. Because Kendrick disappointed us all after he gave us what he gave us last year and then went silent.
NLE Choppa is a meat ride
You’re not 2Pac or Michael Jackson stop trying to act like them meet Rider
This shit is trash. NBA Youngboy is better.
KO
🔥
NBA my fav rapper by this unbeatable
Loving the UGANDA flag❤
people act like young boy, telling his fans to do the stuff he do he’s just trying to make music and make a living. I ain’t never seen young boy beat on a female or tell anybody to do anything crazy.
Weird sh!t
Checkers floor, red coat, red essential. I have to say NLE might belong to the industry now on.
🗑️
I'm from the 80s/90s......let's be peaceful y'all. I don't want to see two more young souls lose their lives over nothing #Tupac #Biggie let it go! Whatever y'all got going on.   And yes, I listened to the lyrics YB said it himself in a interview that he can't be who he really is because of the way he came into the industry but that's not true! He might lose a lot of followers but he'll also gain a lot if he changed up his image and just be himself and not portray the thug life stuff that yes, he himself said he was really was not. His words not mine but chill out young ones
Wow, this is real and not AI. 🤦🏾‍♂️
yo aint nba young ur fav rapper nga?😂😂
Talent
No way he’s seriously trying to beef. He’s only 23. This is fun to him, he’s just a kid
Nle old coming back 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
now that I hear it.. shit kinda go hard 💙
Every word in this song is true
sampled hit em up by tupac is crazy
Now this is what need !
Who tf told u to be bald

Shut up bro like not to be rude not to be rude but like can you just like stop talking about him like he's my guy like that I was just listening to his songs and I will listen to murder on my mind so like just please stop talking about my guy you think❤❤
Yall be sick riding rappers so much that they can drop garbage than yall gon say “ this different 🔥”

It's giving Micheal Jackson vibes.
bro put like 5 good concepts together and made a fuckin mess 😂
Temu gay 2pac how do you make a song about free young boy? And diss him
Beat and hook is absolutely trash
It shows the message was passed over people’s head He’s literally saying wassup with you hurting the black community  Let’s catch a fade  He’s a real one 💯 He’s speaking up on what’s wrong in the community 💯
But you don’t cross the line he’s bigger than you. You just jealous.
If he was gay
You’re gay 2pac
Timu 2Pac
Do you make a song about him free young boy
I'm sorry it's wack coming for YB! Nle seems sassy to me. He said YB not good for the youth but he was on stage saying "If I was a bad bish I f myself" boo bye 😂😂 YB had sassy ish going on too , them pics of him laying on his hb lab. Yeah 2 DL men going against each other 😂😂
This shit so harddd
Weakest diss in rap history
Top shotta🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I don't care what y'all say, this young man snapped on this one 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is the anger buried deep down inside, stemming from millennia’s. That’s a very dangerous energy to channel for ‘a handful of people’ watching this cause only a handful understands.
😢😢😢😢 ko nle made it great 👍🏿❤❤ nle long leave legend
So, im lost with this video
What's 256 flag  doing in this video
youngboy ot fk NLE
All the Masonic symbolism 👁️
Nothing says gangsta like a 120lb guy wearing a bedazzled shirt doing dance routines.
Oi Gisaan
Had happened to this dude????? He went from making absolutely bangers to someone that prays to literal rocks, became a sex symbol, now he acting like Tupac????? How many identity crises will this man have????
NLE shoulda been in the biopic
This shit is ass, from the lyrics to the song. To the music video to everything
I FUKKIN LOVE IT DONT LET YB DESTROY YO CAREER DISS HIS ASS IF YALL DONT KNOW YOUNGBOY DISSED NLE CHOPPER ON KNOW LIKE I KNOW SO NLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO DIS THIS MAN ANYTIME THAT HE PLEASES
This was horrible. He must have a spell on this song for people to actually think this is good music or even a good video. These young artists have no talent, just popularity and obsessed fans.
who else lisening from south Africa🥶🥶
This shit so azz.
Now go listen to Tupac’s version… I can’t see nothing but his mannerisms 🕺🏿 🩰 💁🏿‍♂️👨🏿‍❤️‍👨🏿🌬️🫧🫧🍌🌭🤾🏼‍♂️🤹🏽‍♂️🎭🎪🤡
Hope no one dies from this beef

🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬Well… idc what nobody says NLE choppa ACTUALLY has somethin so say..
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
youngboy finna slap you soon
I can honestly say I always liked NLE Choppa, but I am not about to pretend like I saw this coming. He really shook up the rap game with this one. There really is not anyone who is not talking about it. I see in the comment section 17 thousand plus people believe YoungBoy will drop a banger in response to this which is where I am headed next. While I might not listen to very much YoungBoy he shocked me recently dropping a killer track. So, who knows he might come with it.
Ya know what…..I aint even mad at it 😂😂😂😂
Shasha kwambili ❤

Bro team Ethiopia's dance made his music unique.
Dog the hypocrisy is crazy 😭
❤😂
Wow🤦‍♂️
Zestiest video I've seen in a while...
It's actually terrible like I knew it would be. Not a fan anymore. Tryna be relevant by tearing someone down is not it.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I approve the message YB is Trash fr
NLE Choppa how did South Africa get involved in this beef please leave us out
🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬
That shyt was so hard!
Wack 👎
Crazy how this new generation can make the past as if it nothing has happened, I’m not sure if he’s just mocking or he’s really putting this as the the past is new cool sh*** we in this together.  Ain’t Corn, strawberry or anything no voice we do enough for this to be part of this enormous controversy.
Who the fudge actually listens to this in there car or house? This is a gimmick for the internet
This shi trash, and Choppa better hope this beef stays on wax, because his career started by his mama ain't gonna stop anything
I like the message but wth🤣🤣🤣
Micheal Jackson
Kinda sounds like NLE isn't working for Satan on this. But that's just part of Satan's plans. Satan wants people to believe that the person he puts out (NLE) is actually the good one. And that the person the good one is talking BAD about (Youngboy) is actually the bad one when actually BOTH of the individuals are "the bad one". Among other things... NLE mentioned "embrace my light and my dark" in this song. But people are not to be both good and evil (light and dark) according to Scripture (The Bible). We are to JUST be GOOD / of the LIGHT. But Satan wants people thinking that it's ok to be both good AND bad/evil (light and dark). But if person is living a life where they ALSO do BAD... that doing BAD part is something that can STILL get them sent to HELL. On top of that... NLE is doing the 666 handsign at the start of video. 666 is connected to Satan in Scripture. And Satan is a known deceiver. And Satan can deceive folks through people he uses. If I could talk to NLE directly about all this... I would. Because it's a choose one side or the other type of thing. We are not be both good and bad/evil (light and dark).
In case yall missed it, in the beginning when he is breathing, he is saying Yah-weh Yah-weh. He is preaching Jesus. I just want to let yall know. he is on the good side!
THIS IS GOOD
Dude can actually dance
I guarantee u all , this video and song are going to get Grammy nominations, They are that good. Idk about winning one , but for sure HAS to get nominated for best video, it has to lol

I’m a 37 year old black man and I neva heard an NLE song, but this shit go hard. Lyrically superior to the BBL Drizzy and They not like us diss tracks by Kenrick Lamar. This shit is really good.
Actually impressed with this video. Lyrics and the song itself aside, production, choreography, visuals, etc. is very good this was dope to watch.
Jesus loves yall
Bol lookin very fruity in this jawn 😂
FIREEEEEE LOVE IT
I’m just so confused by the video… I watched it three times just to see if I can figure it out …  I’m 32. I’ve never listened to a NBA YoungBoy song in my life… but this song is trash I’ll be honest..
Now u gotta get young boi back he just dissed u
This is a great music
YB Who?

How are yall so impressed by this?? It's literally just a bunch of other random Artists concepts thrown together to make a diss and it's actually highly disrespectful to Mike,Prince,Pac,and Ali. Then it's so overly freaky and he sounds a mess. Ts is not art ts is Trolling while using other people image.
Nice visual and homage to the legends
This man has the same bellodee as Tupac and the same beat and same posses  and same outfits style
😂😂😂😂😂 This shit is some 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩

This gotta be the cornest shit I've seen in a while
This s*** was dope as f***
He should do a song with that last beat sounds fire 🔥🔥
U cat seg lol
Black guys wanna be Italian so bad
I can’t tell if he dissing mj as well cause mj my king and I’ll be mad
Any UGANDAN or SOUTH AFRICAN 🤣
Like if he ain’t diss young boy this song would had not been fire stop it clout chasing at its finest
If you're not gonna go harder than hit em up, stop using the damn beat
Trash keep young boy name out your mouth
Ngl the video corny but you gotta listen to what he saying it’s not bad
This is pathetically gay
I’m proud of his change God has really blessed him I’m sure KVon  would be proud too because he was trying to change as well
Video ight but song is straight garbage
Gayest shi iv ever seen😂 dude moving zesty asf
Bro I just said what if now go bald 0:48
Well he worked for a good video I’ll give him That…   Won’t be playin this shit in my car tho 😂😂
What tf is a Ugandan flag 🇺🇬 doing in NLE video? 😂😂
This isn’t godly at all
Wwooow 🎉🎉
After watching I realized it's ai
Very creative. Mofos can say what they want, this was dope especially the verses.
I give him his props. He's bringing creativity back to the rap game. These videos don't be s*** no more. I give him a A+ for effort. Very creative
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Never seen someone get spanked and shot and knocked out all in one video 😂
yall so used to mfs being "too cool" yall forgot about creativity lol
Boi yo ass done😂
I’m praying u don’t get pop
Nle went off the rails he will never be the next tupac cant nobody ever be the great
This 💩 sound kinda fruity it’s lame.
Revenge so sweet   What you can I can do better
NLE EAT THAT
🗑 🚮 🗑 🚮
Wth was that bruh lol like I hear what you saying .. but what you doing ?
Gayooo Gayooo I’m booty EIO 😂

Anyone else hip to the Masonic checkerboard
KO
This some mason shit
Good job
NLE jst barked iongl
Interesting video……. 🥴
Hands down one of the best visuals I have seen. I’ve been seeing clips but watching it in its entirety was special. I came for a diss, I’m leaving impressed how creative NLE is evolving.
I don’t understand this song is fye 🔥
I didn’t kno this dude had bars fr 😂
TRASHHHHH
Good vs evil type shita
My favorite video and song this year hands down
Whoever ok’d this video needs to be fired.
Yall crazy It don't make no sense
😂😂😂😂😂
He the next Tupac😭
Whew 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I will never play this again
The videos a distraction because they tryna get him to beef w young boy to trick young boy out his spot after a great tour , young boy ain’t going for the bait
Ts so cringe
this might be the worst Music video of all time and his disses are asss
all yb fans kno this shit hard😂
If you wanna know how to diss Kendrick and Drake literally set the bar. You don’t make no zesty ass video with mid ass lyrics. Even the Game diss to Rick Ross was SO MUCH BETTER THEN THIS TRASH ASS SONGS. I respect everyone’s opinion. If yall think this shit is hot or cReAtIvE then honestly you probably gay asf or your taste in music is trash. Or even then you tryna beef with a gangsta YOU DONT MAKE NO ZESTY ASS MUSIC VIDEO. Got the nerve to claim he like 2Pac. Yall gonna piss me off with all the dickriding yall doing in the comments.
🔥🔥🔥
Wrong person to beef with gee money lol
nle got some south african moves ii see😊🇿🇦
Got em

Choreography lyrics slaps hard asf🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bro finally got a hit (only off YB name)😂😂😂 if YB don’t answer, your career is done even worse than it is
Say what you want about him, I really love his art and creativity in this video. It’s really amazing and I enjoyed it!
2:03 Ali bomaye

NLE WENT CRAZYY ON THIS
Seen him in person nle is better than yb
Diss Songs don’t come with dance routines😂😂😂😂
No lie that junt was so creative
Nooo
If this is your introduction to NLE then it's a damn good start. This entire thing as an art is fuckin dope. And he's doing this as two different personalities which is why he weaves in and out God talk and street talk. Shit so fire and so layered.
You used to like young boy you literally said that live
When i’m in a bad mood i come watch this video
I ain’t go lie I want to dance🎉
Got damn haven’t heard a diss song this hard since  daxs im not Joyner diss to Tory lanez 🔥 the visuals and choreography is 10/10 flow delivery and bars 10/10
I love this video man!! So unique and so many messages!! I also respect that he PUT THE GUN DOWN!!! Great job NLE THE GREAT def a fan now!!
This is hard❤
Nle is bald
this is probably the best track in us rap/trap for the past 10yrs
1:50 1:50 1:51 1:53 1:54 1:56 1:58 1:59 2:00 2:01 2:02 2:03 2:03 2:04 2:06 2:06 2:07 2:07 2:08 2:09 2:09 2:10 2:11 2:11 2:12 2:13 2:13 2:14 2:15 2:15 2:15 2:15 2:15 2:15 2:16 2:16 2:16 2:16 2:16 2:17 2:17 2:17 2:17 2:17 2:18 2:18 2:18 2:18 2:18 2:19 2:19 2:19 2:19
Trash song
nah he went crazy in this video ts fireeee
Funny part is this song old he been did this when he was dressing like pac and in the tub he been waiting a long time to release this. I guess YoungBoy never dissed him so this was his time to get a piece of the shine
Best song out rn listen to this everyday on repeat 😂 not because of the beef obviously that hypes it up a bit but the message and the creativity sheeeesh
Wtf did I just see 👁️
Trash
YB better
I can tell NLE regret selling his soul just from the messages he sends but he’s still another industry puppet who has to obey them. Look at all the black/white and red/white coloring. That represents duality/good and evil/light and dark i.e. Satanic symbolism and worship
Someone hand NLE his crown 👑🎧🔥
Get em  Chopp
They playing chess or checkers?
Bro said I'm big like Micheal but I get down like pac and dance like childish Gambino
I bet NLE WILL WIN A ONE ON ONE FIST FIGHT
Batty boy!😂
Waiting for NBA's reply 😊
South Africa gather here
Thank you so much yb about to drop a banger!!!🗣🗣
Thanks for the South African flag shout out
2:52 is wild nikka gay
Don’t even know why he playing with TOP This way😂
No more choppa 😂😂😂😂 f ya bowy😢😢
NLE Choppa and NBA Youngboy need to step in the ring in real life and box‼️🥊🥊🥊🥊
who else can bet that 2pac would play this everyday if he was still here with us
NLE trollin tf outta NBA
I love this songgg nd the message it gave
Too hard❤
heavenly father i pray you keep nle safe with who he jus dissed🙏
No way bro THIS LIKE DRAKE VS KENDRICK
I seen my country flag in the background ❤
Legendary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you bro foreal
MAN DOWN
The creativity was insane.
I didnt like the running with the head part, i mean bro got a mom and 42 kids
I’m soooo obsessed with this. Beef aside, the artistry is admirable to say the least. Wow. 🔥
And all the demons are mad behind this vidoe CHARLES THE WHITE himself
Young boy in coma ..nle the great ❤
Baldiee gon gett it 4KT 4 Lyfe!
Many people won't actually get the message behind this , this ain't just no regular song check the illustrations all that black and white chess board ,, meaning somebody getting controlled and used check throughout you will understand this song and video has exposed a lot
Damn I love that girl a 2:27 in the video she 🔥 and was un point too
If he don’t get his flowers from this same as Kendrick did I know some. You did that bruh!
Can’t front, that was dope.

This is the kind of American entertainment that we don’t need, want or ask for, this is lame in some ways imaginable, HIT ME UP please 😒
Here to confirm if that flag I saw on the Facebook snippet is actually a South African flag🇿🇦 and it really is.
What in the gay gangster $#!× is this. Pac went to an art school that tuition is $56,000 a year then acted in movies because he was a theater kid . Did a movie called juice the character he played was a thug all of a sudden he went from I get around to Americans most wanted, which ended up getting him killed now these rich rappers want to hard so bad .. why yall so mad go to church take care of them kids and if they really want the fade put them gloves on and handle it like men oh the to scared for an @$$ beating
I think I would respect this more if it wasn't unprovoked lol. It just gives attention seeking. Like I get the message but he could've delivered the same message without creating fake beef lmao
Yesssssssssssss❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Big Like! Finally a a nice clip and a guy with talent - Kudos from far Israel.
Set the boxing match up naaaaaaaa
f yeah nba youngboy is wack af
YB BETTER 💚🤝🏾
YB BETTER ✅ 🌀💯🎯
No f*ck a hater, this is unique, and direct. Put effort into the video, this is Hip Hip and this is HIP HOP 🔥
Uganda stand up 🎉❤❤❤
Y’all need to leave NBA YoungBoy alone. I love his music too, but he tripping wishing death on somebody.
Bro u just chasing clout now
Str8 from the (Most High granddaughter now Most high ) ghost KO killing the Oll Big Cartel not (knock out) Big killer Real Cartel shit Guess who's back Jamaican Cartel shit fresh out

Everyone hating in these comments. He tore young boy tf up. He look better. A better rapper just all together better

Creativity thru the roof
Ts hard

I actually really like the video! I think the preview that's been going around on social media doesn't do this any justice. I appreciate the uniqueness and creativity of his kind expressed through this video. Thanks NLE
Dude is everyone but himself
bruh turn gangster again
Not even trying to be funny but this most ass shit I heard in a min
Bro went in
Check my page out yall 😅
Hmm is it a diss to Freemason or does NLE chops have a master still. Black and white checkered flooring is heavily a Masonic symbol
I thought Chris brown went gangsta gangsta on US LOL
‼️🔥
start was  soo remarkable and delivered significantly    Can't deny NLE The Great  been in his bag since day one, but that HIPVIEWS DAWT CAWM boost is on another level! Dude’s literally unstoppable now. 🔥💥

5.4 million views in 5 days 🤯
Turn up !! Stretch sumthg,bless sumthing that the new vibe 🔥🔥
THIS IS THE GREATEST MUSIC VIDEO OF 2025 IM CALLING IT NOW.
🔥 💯🖤
THIS WENT OVER ALOT OF FOLKS HEAD, but it’s not meant for everyone to understand right now but later on they will NLE. NBA Young boy better do his fucking part cause he’s leading the youth straight to the fire with his negative influence.
This is deeper than most of ya’ll will ever realize iykyk
Charleston White jamming this lol
This better than I thought it was. I was only catching snippets at first n thought wtf is this garbage but when u watch it in entirety it’s actually hard 🔥💯
Anyone else notice he was everybody but himself?
What the Helly?
What the helly
Your music is so trash why is you dancing like a s!ssy in a diss record? your a hypocrite you said youngboy poisoned the youth at 2:24 when you did the exact same thing with shotta flow an all them other drill songs and you did countless of suspect things in the industry f outta here your a sell out TOO! Just like NBA is!😅🤣😆 @NLECHOPPA
This dude so damn goofy, it's hard to take him serious. Why is he doing MJ/Chris Brown type of style on a diss track?
Algún kuler0 que able español 🇲🇽💯 y me diga qué rollo estos son como cartel y c kan oke???? Se dan un tiro o no el youngboy tiene unos pelotazos en la frente
I ain’t buying it’s beef til someone end up 💀
I gotta say I was truly entertained. Even laughed a few times. Ppl rather see them have a shoot out till death than keep it in the music.
Dis sounda like trash 🗑️ lotta rass he bee singing
Bro will never see these types of numbers on one of his videos again 😂😂
wtf is this 😂
Fire 🔥 bro made my 2026
NLE❤
I really like this song. But I know he ain't talking about head hunting on these waters in louisiana. He's gonna wind up floating in em. 😂
What the fuck is a South African flag doing on this video😂
I feel bad for a King Von
And you’re the best rapper
This is making my ears bleed. Yall listen to ANYTHING.
Ko
And I also like your music
NLE Choppa, do you wanna team up with me to kill NBA YoungBoy and the Quando Rondo, Homie, kill
This🥷 was usher, Michael Jackson, 2Pac ,all in one video smh 😂👎🏿
Ts so good
Can someone give me a chair to sit so that I can listen to this song in peace
Ion know bout this one.  Definitely in the running for zestiest diss track with Sweetface Killah
This is art W NLE🥇🕺🏿
Yb is done 😂
KO Ko don't step any further 😂😂 💥💥💥🕺🏿
The beep must continue not until yb stepped down😂
You don't have originality, NBA is far better than you still 💯💯💯
I’m not big into rap beef or whatever’s happening with folks but I enjoyed this visual and actually like the lyrics. Added this to my gym playlist.
Ayeeeee na hold up whole songs snap
Message
Damn he did him bad in this song
This lowkey tuff
god this is awful. this nigga really can‘t rap. how is this shit being sold? this new gen rappers should stay off classic beats, it just exposes how bad they rap. really would like to listen to the whole song but i simply can‘t listen to this awful shit.
Ngga wanna be 2pac and mj at the same time 😂
Dmmm 😮🔥
Ko👿
THIS is kind of art I'ma cool with 😅
This video is.......... weird. Kinda weird. The flashiness certainly increases the cache of an otherwise mid song, but everyone screaming "art" in the comments needs to calm down.
bro you could hear that nle found Christ, the start of the song goes "yahweh", run it back if you dont believe me.🐐!
I can do a better Micheal Jackson
I love it ❤😂NBA yb really ain't good for our youth ..reason he will never see Hollywood besides riding thru ...this young man hit classical verses from classic rappers all in 1 prince ..Mike .and 2pac..that takes skill ..and he talks about killing just as NBA yb do in all his music
This shit 🔥
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤😂😂😂
Sold out
Unbelievably trash
He was riding that pac flow
You desing nba young boy😢
He sold out. Zesty like the white folks like our strong black men. Lord bless him
This video! Im in awe
Love this
Amazing diss. Wow such creativity.
This is fire 🔥
❤❤❤
In boosie voice cmon dog😅
Nigga really cross dressing on some "give me the ick" shit over a 2pac beat. I guess the game changed
This is trash. NLE and NBA both worship the same Demonic God. NLE looks like he has been cloned. He is no better than NBA. NLE does the samething. NLE is gathering souls too. All the symbolism in this video but he is in the light??? Y'all have to wake up. The are both in the same gang!!!! They are both demonic and poisoning the youth and the black community.NLE just hides it better!! I thought he said his ritual was over,he still look zest with the wide legs pants, red jacket and glitter black shirt. Rap music is doomed!
With a South African flag 😂😂
Bra. This finna go in history. This one of the best diss tracks ever. I know it sounds crazy. Ian a super fan of either. And I'm from Mississippi! By Louisiana and Tennessee! But this hard ass diss
This is going to go down in rap history for the new school 🏫 Dame NLE I can't believe you use old and new school in one move Dame you even dance MJ and Chris brown
I Love The Energy!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤
😂😂😂😂 He Killed This Fr
Young boy changed, he humble.
Ts is premium ass🔥🗑️
Makes me think if they not like us 🤭😅
starting thinking creativity was dead but not this one!
This is talent
Sexyyyyyyy mfffff
I aint gone lie my boy look confused
THIS SONG IS AHHH OMG
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤THIS IS FIRE 🫵🏽✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾 he see what the industry is doing. He see how the industry puppet black culture he showing you that our culture need to stay strong that we are the ones who bought a lot of hits and songs for the day when I’m treat them behind doors like slaves or make them homosexual killing their kids and family members for sacrifices keep bringing awareness stay strong. I love this this whole video.
ko
This right here is a masterpiece a banger a reality self check a black culture movement this that’s right here. Every black person need to give him his flowers on this one. He sees the industry he see what they doing to our Black people he ain’t dumb your visual is tight. I love you for this one.
He ain’t diss him until everybody start fucking with yb that shit lame and he a yb fan
Y’all say bye to nle he might gonna get killed

He tried to do what pac and Kendrick did with their diss songs…hell he even tried to do what drake did to meek..turn his diss song into a hit track
I'm sorry but this is one of the gayest things I've ever seen . Seriously with the half naked dancing... is this some humiliation ritual like mgk cliche
Was this video made to be funny
🎉
bro this rlly one of my fav prod ever ngl gng
this is seriously amazing and i listen to YB but as a mature listener i understand the message  NLE is trying to send with this song
"Take Money" was the only thing missing in this masterpiece
Dang, NLE - these bars are FYE! Keep using discernment! 🙏🏾💕
This ain't it😅

I MEAN IS BRO LYING? NLE has made some negative music in the past and some weird songs but I've never seen him be any kind of major trouble.
I'm LIVING for this LEVEL of BRINGING IT!!! ✋🏼✋🏼✋🏼Pat yourselves on the back for all involved.
This trash I think he just mad he can’t get a feature 😂
Nle Finn’s get his ass flamed by yb

Brodie came home had to pick em up shit way better ngl
Bro movin like breezy  🔥🤣  yb still better tho🖕
Love this video how it was made. You paid homage to Micheal Jackson and slavery and just trying awake ppl up of an artist that is poisoning the youth. ❤❤❤❤
NLE this was a KO at every level! Your Lyrics are out of this world you're a genius for real!! Your looks are a 10 out of 10 and I'm not even talking about how your body looks like a Greek God statue! Whoever choreographed your dance needs a raise and you need a bigger raise to be able to pull it off as good as you did! Your message in the Lyrics are 100 percent facts! YB is a role model to some of these kids and he is teaching them doing drugs and getting in trouble with the law is cool. A lot of them are going to find out the hard way that those things are nothing to look up too. I also love how your so secure in your sexuality that you could care less if someone tells you that u r zesty bc first of all there is nothing wrong with that (and as a member of the LGBT thank you so much for not turning your back on us its means the world to many of us!) And secondly people who are actually fans know how much you LOVE the meows 😻...lol keep doing you brother!
Gayo😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 weak
Love it 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤
clock it you knew what you was doin with that
Shit ass boy 😂😂😂😂
FOR KING VON 🎭
Youngboy will kill nle keep talking that shi on gawd
The song is good the video is sassy ass Fu+k. No diss song you should be dancing and prancing around like that! At All! Did 2pac do that? Ice Cude? Jay'z? Nas? No one! But this the extra sexual tight clothes dressing like a girl new rappers!
Yeah , its HIT EM UP

This some snl party at prince house beef song
NLE I'm sorry why you do that you know Youngboy is dangerous ASF I would take this down before more people see it you might be cooked
It’s giving 2pac and Michel Jackson frrr
WTF IS THIS

Nle is not a rapper he‘s an artist fr
🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦

This a new channel 😂 bro knew who to diss to get it up
This is good but I'm still a nb yb fan but W song

Love the vid bro I'm tapped in
0:51 where he Gt that hair from lol😅
개좋다
yea so idk who he think he is dissing king kentrell
This is dope well the song is video idk
Man at first I was a little confused, but I kept watching lol not the biggest nle fan but the bars was nice & the video was interesting!
YHWHYHWHYHWHY ❤
This a huge advancement from disses even rivaling Kendrick disses matter a fact this better.
video is actually very ceeative and shows how nle is a good artist
This nigga Michael Jackson Mike Tyson & Tupac all at the same time 😶‍🌫️ NLE YOUNGBOY for the win !! Shout out Kentrell King of Baton Rouge !!!!
Hope that this beef won’t reach out the streets!
He not really saying shit at all
First NLE song I’ve listened too, or video I’ve seen. It’s catchy, pays homage to the greats, gets his diss across, choreographed like a mf… this is fire.
Not even trying to say anything controversial but this dude fucking sucks.
Lourd lourd 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This song is trash . And he zesty asf too . YB ain’t any better .
Brother nle I’m not gonna lie u actually made such a banger track fham long live u brother but I still f w nba youngboy to😂
Still a yb fan😁
“Blow ya head off ya neck like a dandelion” followed up with the shit bag verse is crazy hard
This is overly trash
NLE got no real ones on his team allowing him to release this video.
I have not seen anything this good in min love when the music turns to creativity bless nle the great
Track fire definitely something different
This feels like when melly mel dissed Eminem lol not saying YB is Eminem I’m saying context wise
Oh NBA YoungBoy fucking him and his career up after his tour ends
Ummm I can see the artistic expression but the message of unaliving YB because of a beef or difference of opinion is crazy to me. Like you literally running down the road with a severed head in your hand. That’s not a messiah. This is IKYFL😳😒
Judgement day around the corner, the creator livid is such a hard bar
Bro tryna be 5 ppl at once 😂 but the song lit
I love nle music but this shit right here is dirt like DEADASS but I’m more of a young boy FAN SORRY IF I HURT A NIKKA FEELINGS 😂😂😂😂
I don't understand this video?  Y is he dancing in a dis track?? Lml these youngins are different lml
Somebody gotta down after this

Them checkered floors ain’t fooling nobody
1:43 is that Blueface??????????
Modern day hit em up
This is so buns just saying
I like so this song
Great song. Very creative. One question, wasn't he the same kind of rapper with less success? Now he is changing & that's great also. Yet it still has negativity towards YB or all violence isn't the same
Where is George the monkey
Sheesh this was Tuff 🩵
Firreeeee!!

The people that are glazing Yb saying that weird stuff like "yb still better, he made a diss three years ago and he just now responding or he having an identity crisis" are the ones definitely mad about this, or they just wanna feel better by saying dat. Btw this is fire, DC what anyone say. Don think it's fire, listen to media day. (Also Im not glazing, or I may be)
The worst track of the country. NBA YB just need to stay quiet
Niiice one...😂😂😂

Koul youm bouraka bouraka
you're the best NLE Respect 👊
Ts lowkey ahh

He won. 👏🏻
Too much zest for me. I miss masculine hip hop.
2pac Jackson
Mane bring back nle choppa
Nle  we need to talk
He had all the artist voice ❤
Clout chasing 😂
Clout chasing at it finest 😂 🚮
only bad thing about this is that he said yb was his fav rapper
"It's time to dome them you can smell the aroma" young gay fans big mad
I keep coming back to this video. Visuals are awesome. Lyrics were fire 🔥
he really snapped on a homage beat, credit is due
This is supa hot fiya on the low high
Fake getting spank with the belt is crazy 😂😂
Man... this is it. this is the type of beef that takes me back.. He really channeled pac for a minute there.. keep it goin
What he do u can do better  Can't even fill a arena doe
That’s gay.
Gay!
I don’t think you know where King Von is
Not he dissing yb
Bru this song just mess up my day
The creativity in this video is A1 🔥
This what happens when these “YNs”survive long enough to grow up heal and embrace their creativity to their fullest potential without fear of being “cringe”and allow women to represent and produce alongside them❤ never even listened to a singular song by this man but the message is amazing and I’m a fan
Talent vs keepin our youth dumbed down. His concert name even tell you what he on 😂 y'all don't get it

The reaper want a visit Judgement Day around the corner, the Creator livid Purposely making decisions to promote mo' violence That's bringing mo' death unto his innocent children When I do it, it's different, when he do it, it's ignorant I'm in love with the art, he tearing people apart Embrace my light and my dark, why he ain't doing his part? Why he ain't doing his part? Why he ain't doing his part? 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥that’s called LYRICS! SUBSTANCE! TRUTH! ART! HIP HOP! WHAT OUR PEOPLE NEED! BLACK PEOPLE! I could gaf how anybody else feels about this song! He’s lyrics are deep as hell if you actually listen and don’t try to focus on his dancing and to change in his lifestyle and direction.

Weird to say the least. NLE is a YB Stan, been biting YB for years his style, his hair etc. then makes a diss track using YB voice n cadence. Posing as other celebrities literal GOATs in their fields. The he calls himself NLE the great. I dunno not a good look more like NLE the Poser.

Yooooooo NLE !!!! This s**t 🔥🔥🔥

2pac, is that you?
This was a genius record, and I’m a tough critic
Dope
He just jealous of yb 😂
He is a mason pawn !!!!
He wanna be yb so bad
The biggest one sided beef in history 😂
😂😂dope
YB BETTER
Video is kinda cool but bro is up there dancing and shaking his hips in a diss song?
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lil baby thinks if he raps about girls its gunna keep the feds off his a**
I give nle 3 months lol ain’t seen many comments about this so he must be hiding em yb ain’t someone to be dissed lol
mfker blew up by doing the same shit. Rapping about guns, violance, etc.. He was making this type of songs even this year too. Then he vanishes from the internet, comes back with a whole different identity roleplaying another grown ass man and acts like his whole past got deleted of the internet or something? Dissing people you took inspiration from and that you used to glaze. Mfker made a song called "FREE YOUNGBOY 2" like 9 months ago and now you gonna diss the same person lmao. It doesnt matter if its aimed on YB or anyone else, what NLE does is nonsense, its hypocritical and contradictive and yall sheeps in the comments really fw the song ignoring the truth. I already know NLE stans gonna call me a YB dickrider, stan, a fanboy, etc. but at the end of the day thats all yall can do because you know its facts and you cant prove me wrong.
Zesty ahh diss 😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
BEST DISS ON NBA IN 2025
This is absolute booty juice 😂😮
Those lyrics! NLE just gained an ear he been showing a he a real one since Von death.

NBAYOUNGBOY IS COMING 😏🐍💚✍🏻
This seemed so demonic, but creative. I hear his lyrics he’s speaking the truth it seems and i understand what he’s saying. But something is dark. And is the director of this video named “the most high?” Am I missing something? Smh
It would have been top tier WITHOUT the music video. Should've done the performance after few months like Kenny did😢
Slide for von  # real G mode is on 🔥🔥
YB better
NLe better
I did one on this beat tygod07

His aura gives u what 😂😂😂
Listen to him there is. A message!!!!
Hypocrisy at it's finest 😅 NLE,  you send out the exact same energy to the youth that yb does. Y'all are both slaves to your Masonic masters. Only difference is yb tells you how demonic his music is. While you try to play both sides. You are both aligned with the devil. Sorry but I'm not
I ain’t gon lie nle this shi ass
Then NBA will respond by mumbling 😂
Lord Wat a beautiful Masterpiece 💯
2Pac Resurrection🥹😝
Yb a sucka and a fool for misleading this generation
WTF LMFAO 🤣🤣🤣

I could never take this man seriously dancing like that smh
He needs to stop yb better he soon be the next pack word bozo
Wrap it up unc yb better😂
Tupac?
good vs evil I'm here for it. before yb dummies reply with their cry's, violence is acceptable when its aimed towards evil
When this much money goes into a “diss track” it’s definitely made up industry beef.
Thank God sm1 said smth to yb tht fool a bum
U know what happen when yb get dissed better delete
This guy must be a reincarnation
Song !!! Good y’all tripping very creative
Yikes! This shit is too reckless. Where tf  are the OGs? It's not Youngboy you need to worry about it's all the people around him...everyone who has interest in dude ain't gonna let that slide and the best sign would be if he actually responds.. if it's all crickets, niggas finna get hella grimey on the low.
I wish von was here to see this😢
Corny video fire bars
Why it seem like they holding  number
Meanwhile he has a song FREE YOUNG BOY, he's on that dirk train 😂😂
🙄but he got two free youngboy songs
The video was dope but the song was meh
Good job
Junkie tuff guy vs zesty tuff guy beef lol
Trash! Just another example of the white man getting rich off of confrontation between young black men, but u fools dont care u love being brainwashed
same mf who made final warning btw
I ain’t gone lie yb can’t be practicing semen retention because his fans be ridin him too hard
OK I like what he did.with moves , the dance power moves are everything , ❤
Trashhhh
I hope it was worth it,, it won’t be long now.. This only ends one way
This is art.
Being this type of entertainer is a lost art in todays music, not just hip hop
Really trash
Why he dancing like mj is nle a pdf
Ion even like yb like that and this bad
I think it's garbage all this new rap sucks
Some one said a diss track with choreography and I can’t get over that this would’ve hit harder without all the dancing

Is he gay?
Niggas don’t know bout this frl😂 niggas really grew up wit niggas shii bring back memories my nigga denilo 🔥

I can't hate, this is a hit.
🚮🚮🚮
He killed it 🔥🔥🔥
Gay and lame!
Keep it on for DURK
Yooo this right here is something special and if you @NLE Choppa keep it up you'll be bigger then 50 and I mean that in a respect way even 50 will agree this is different and amazing and fs got yb feeling some type of way with out a dought finna be another Kendrick and drake situation but one we actually wanna see that has to do with some big beef and some real talent that is produced from it and I don't mean yb he's gonna need to step it up at first I questioned it but then seeing the video play with the song it was amazing haven't heard something good in a minute never a dole momment
Why they have beef ??
"Clip like a dick, dump it 'til it's all gone, that's a sex change" GOOD FUCKING LORD
Why is everyone saying ts is fire? Lmaooo it’s really bad
Heavenly father I come to you today to ask you to please watch over this young man and his career, cover him from head to toe with your blood, love, and blessings watch over his family as well and please keep them safe and on the right track lord please forgive them for sins they know they had committed and sins they don't kno they have committed in Jesus name amen
https://youtu.be/LioPpkd0wbw?si=7PUD0FieZ6jxOMXC
Bruh Choppa is better than YB he be spitting YB be rapping the same but i been a fan of his music since 2015. Choppa is jack of all trades
If someone dropped a diss dancing like this … I wouldn’t take it serious
Dude was doing some of everything 😂😂 Micheal Jackson one min Tupac next min 😂 Ali list goes on 😂😂 but creativity definitely there tho nle hell 😂
Have a bless day in God bless yall and your family and friends and God love yall and I love yall to and here the gospel 1 Corinthians 15:1-4   1 now brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand. 2 by this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain. 3 for what I received I passed on to you as of first importance that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 that  he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,
The replay value in this song is  crazy
This is song for ♾️ this song is so deep
How many more gon keep fuckin wit top smh
I had to listen to this a few times
Grown ass man btw getting spank wow😂😂😂😂
Bruh he trolling but speaking real messages he know YB a sellout but NLE is with the boule puppets too just like Kendrick
nn he’ll bya
Kentrell better
2:39 got me dead 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This song is hard
I mean, the hook was there, even the choreography to a mimic. But I see another element there I thought he defeated? The video was kind of misdirecting wardrobe wise. I wouldn’t have rocked it, but then again I won’t Wrock anything “Sean“ Nothing nicca! But it don’t take away from the drip, just the credibility of it? And then I mean, a lot of his shots was round table shyt only inner seats know what he really saying; and those trained in the arts. But I mean other than that, I get it, it was kind of bold and choreographed warnings. I mean then the jc and devil verse was kind of funny 😂 idk I gotta watch it again to dissect everything in the video.
Jay z still mad at Birdman I guess
yall. it hearing him for real, stop all the d riding…. #stopdridingall2026. been saying this shi since i was in elementary school. no offense to yb career but yall d ride him like he a god. shi pitiful
ถ้าคุณมาประเทศไทยฉันพร้อมหาสมุนไพรวิเศษไปให้คุณแบบฟรีๆที่อยู่ประเทศไทย
The song and the music video goes hard
Ayo can we go back to the free youngboy 😂😂😂

Yb over with good shi nle the real
This is like oh yeah - loved it man you kill that shyt verses and entertainment with the video - you got your point across - this was different and loved it - you and Mexican ot should do a song together - not rap but them rap/ country songs he does - they are bangers as well -  And everyone know yb Been bent by birdman - so he needs to stop acting like he king - instead people on street know he a queen behind the scene

fxck nle this shit diss for YB  all peoaple tink YB songs best  This song is meaningless, everyone chooses their own  🥶
yb has kids with my mom ( she’s fat)
This a diss song or a song for a future movie seriously curious.
This video giving Sinners vibes (the movie)
At first it was funny, then all the sublte imagery started added up, this is much muhc deeper than I originally thought. You can't respond to this, like as message, a response to this is a death sentence, especially a typical diss. I didn't expect this from NLE choppa lol.
After shotta flow and shotta flow remix idk wtf happened to this man and no not saying his music trash but he changed into this new industry image and it ain’t a cool image and he ain’t the only rapper who changed once they touched big money and became a industry guy
Shit is ass we fr here?
This is actually my second song favorite I like from him ❤
Shit is fucking trash
Deep down inside.. They Really do love each other ..like brotherly loove haha
I love how creative it is but don’t fuck with young boy man. That’s the culture
Can’t even understand what he’s saying lame ass diss track
Mad respect homie, this shit fire and speaking truth to the streets man. Hopefully the streets listen.
Nle pls go back to your old self plsss
KK yo I’m gonna B aIO

Man this was dope ass fuck
🫤😐😑 I’m not even a YB fan I like both their music tho but the dancing was a bit overly dramatic and he should have just let the dancers do that for him. You can’t be gangster and dancing like Mike just my opinion bars on point tho.

South Africa Tap In🇿🇦

Em um único video:  - Humilhou o Youngboy, - Usou de forma maestral o beat da maior Diss da história; - Referência f#da ao MJ.  Simplesmente NLE CHOPPA 🔥
I have never seen a diss track with choreography before. This is a new one for me 😂
uu cant be dissing the goat on this type of beat😂& doing all that dancing
The beat and the Chorus fire 🔥 only thing keeping ma head bumping
I’m not mad at the visuals or the choreography …… I just don’t think it fits for a diss record.
Mid.
NLE needs a Gramy for this...Kendrick 2.0
NLE done his thang in this
He DANCED on bidness. Love it.
That’s crazy when this song played YouTube recommended tupac song underneath this video
This nga wanna be Tupac so baddd 😂😂😂😂 0:38

Industry plant
Gotta have heart and he do most of yall followers brain washed
NLE you k ke young boy is going to say something back can’t let that stop you keep it going good song I listen to his music too taht why I’m saying he is going to say something back don’t let his song take you down either
This shit ass
💀
As long as it stays in the studio …:I’m here for it ! NBA where r you at my boy ? 👀😂
People talk about how "bad" the song is but it's not about the flow it's not meant to be a fire catchy song... It's a direct message to that low life yb
Damn what YB do to you? He need to do it again🔥🔥
CLEAN UP ON ISLE TREY

I just can't view this as a dis song, andhim a gangster rapper. He's insulting tupac.
Kendrick had to send him this song and walked him through the video details bc ain’t no way this lil dude just now this wise
Garbage cause you making a diss about somebody is bringing the youth down also you contradict yourself
Maaaaaan give us nle with the locs back 😭
Bro I’m from Jamaica 🇯🇲 can you help us it was a storm killing us last message before Wi-Fi go out again
Ko ❤❤❤❤❤
Micheal Jackson?
Fu*kin  brilliant..this took time..
Kdot really brought back the artistry of a beef and hiphop. long live the king! KENDRiCK LAMAR is the gOAT!
Idk what transition you went through behind the scenes but this is amazing. I feel like I’m watching a whole different person. Still got bars can forever rap🔥🔥
Yb on top ts buns😂🏆
love the moves..
Nle killed him in this not only he did it with Tupac music but pay homage to him and MJ all in one while slaughtering YB if this ain’t creative then idk wat is
Definitely ART!!!!!
NBA Lowkey would tear ur ass apart he prolly ain’t finna respond tho but u cooked with this one no capp😭😮‍💨
"Clean up on isle trey" is wild

CHEEEKSSSS
ASSSSSSSS
KO KO HAM VO D I O

Weak af,   just clout chasing
I think nle super talented and he could frfr make a solid diss but I just don’t think these are it. Like they arnt bad songs but im not going to be like “put that nle diss track on”…I still play hit em up at least once a month so the bar is high
One think nle aint lie when he said that yb poisoning the youth I been saying that shi💯that’s real shi doe
No bap this shit ass since nobody else wants to say it and creativity my ass he's everywhere nigga rocky Micheal Jackson and Tupac 🤣

2019: Turned into a gangster and blew up  Late 2019: Blew up way more   Very early 2020: Changed into spiritually   Early 2020: Top Shotta and blew up more  Late 2020-2021: Beef+ yb beef 2023-2024 The stupid freaky era.  2025: Changed and now stating facts  Good job nle!
This shit lame
Been acting like his role models in one video , this kid is creative
Trash
Gay af l this nigga gonna look back 10 yrs from now and be likewise was i on.
Bigga went from YN to new school Pac
where is his outfit from?
Am seeing the Ugandan flag 🇺🇬 my country ❤️🦅
This ni bout to die
I’m about to download this video This video has been on repeat all day. OMG he is just too fine
been an NLE fan since 2019, his evolution has been remarkable. this is chef’s kiss.
You did that NLE and you fine doing it  just sexy ❤ ain’t nothing like a dancing, rapping, sexy gangster and he got  manners and love his mama he is very respectful Young boy ain’t none of that.  I wouldn’t touch young boy with a 10 foot pole. He just look like he don’t love his self or his mom.
Nah this lil nigga sold his soul wtf happened to bro
Shits trash 😂 weak 2 pack hit em up diss
ABSOLUTE CLOWNERY. Rappers always wanna do some weird ish in videos bro. Just pure clowns
This so 🔥 on mute!
I did not know he could dance like this he dancing and rapping  the artistry of the beat the lyrics and the references of all the greats that he’s impersonating in the video is what got me and he can actually dance
Bro looks like Breezy
Yb better
Ik daum well he ain’t come outside his house since this dropped😂😂
This chit fire cuh 🔥🔥
I'm praying to God that NLE  is going to be still alive after this cuz bro you know you literally know you know you know NBA youngboy this man if he sees a diss track on him he's killing he is going crazy so I hope that  NLE is still going to be alive to this cuz  because NLE is literally holding NBA YoungBoy's head in his hand NLE choppa is cooked
Garbage 😂😂😂😂
Instead of killing each other just set up a boxing match
So nobody caught the Zohran Mamdani reference here? South Africa is where Mamdani went to school and Uganda is where he was born, and now he’s the mayor of NYC. If you look at 2:08 you’ll see the two country flags, it could mean NLE shows his support to the new mayor, very subtle though, not many will catch that.
FAFO 🤷🏻‍♂️
NBA = 🤡'S  4KT = 🤡'S
Damn sounds like someone got him angry 😂😂
Youngboy will never do anything this artistic. Imagine the music NBA would make if he learned to be vulnerable.
I mean its not that good but its kinda good
Yh bro hit mills in a few days this went viral real quick.
So did he do a Major Payne line???
🔥
10/10
Yb better 🐍
I no for a fact Kendrick Lamar proud asf 🎉
Love it
Get him nle get tht nga
Bro, why are you being jealousy bro? You’re just jealous because young boy is going famous and you’re quiet, so maybe you should’ve made more songs and nobody really likes you. No more you you’re not even you’re not even trending. No more bro.
This is genius everything about it!! 🕺🕺
I loved it ❣️
This is Dax the rappers whole style
This a historical hit
This is ass pls make a new dis track dis shit no aura at all
But the way he delivered that Michael B jordan from black panther🥶
All the way from Botswana 🇧🇼
putrid songxz
Masonic floor tho
Facts...🤞🏼
mmmm as a YB listener speaking. When I first saw just clips of this video I was thinking it was corny. However watching this with my 3rd eye I can definitely decode this video. The art is very unique and entertaining. Talent is here. The only thing I can say critical is that if it was a different messenger ppl would not laugh. Don't let this video go above ur heads.
Breath of fresh air definitely
2pac ?
I blame Drake for this abomination  of a diss track!!!
Nle went in on this, Chopper can rap better than YoungBoy, That freestyle he just did is lit too🔥🔥🔥🔥 Chopper has different styles
NLE was an internet thug before fame, Mfks better stop playing with NBA
YB fans are not gonna admit that this mf is hard
Nah this one hittin different ! Plus I read the back story of his thoughts making this which brings it full circle
I love this tbh
Good stuff
The BEST get back for NLE to do against Hot Boy Major for having his promotion billboard taken down in Baton Rouge, LA is to have his team report Hot Boy Major for being a drug addict with a fire arm because he smokes weed all day long, even while driving the streets in his so-called city...Hot Boy Major love flexing with his gun which means he's scared to leave home...but the Federal gun laws prevent him from lying on his application to obtain it because he uses heavy drugs.
It's all good till someone get murked
He reyeng South Africa🇿🇦
Sorry yall but dis shit wack asf
Well there it is!
This id actually a shuper hard ahhh diss yo
This shit fucking gay asf
Yb made u change ur ways what's gonna happen this time.

I HOPE YOU KNOW LIKE I KNOW YOU GON DIE FROM CHOOSIN SIDES THO
This reminds me of the song “Can’t Truss It” by Public Enemy
I aint even gonna cap yb still better ts ass frl 😂😂

Garbage 🗑️
This is terrible dawg
This video is fire and he spitting facts. Most entertaining rap video I’ve seen in a very long time.
What's with the other country flags? Is he trying to merge the other tribes into black American business like monaleo tried to do? I'm just wondering
Is this the next Michael Jackson?
Clean up on what 😂😂😂😂
This is garbage.
Two different channels same person
This Gay AF 😂
This shit ass , all the fake top comments 😂😂 bots
Kanye West vibes 🤣 he's a fuck boy ik why I never liked listening to him

So creative
YB BETTER
Never heard a song from him before this. Yea I’m a fan. It’s time for our young people (I’m an 80s baby) to carry the torch and take the music back from the negative degradation of our people. I’m a fan now. As long as he keeps this energy…I’m a fan!
Sound track is harddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
What does the devil has to offer when the world is already mine...?  Jesus is king🙏🏽
Sorry that was trash 🗑️ 🗑️
2pac Vibe🫡
This is so gay
اخويا 🥰🇺🇲
NLE got it 👑👑
Why it look like 21
I ain't gonna hold you, the actual message and what he is saying in this song is powerful. It's distracting because of the visuals, but if you actually just listen to it, he's speaking truth, ESPECIALLY that last verse.
Who’s back today 😂
😂l look at the devil like this is your kid💥
3:36 nooo nle rip bro he was great person and nice he aint deserve to die
🐐
CREATIVITY MAKING A COMEBACK

Now this is poison ☠️ to the hip hop community 😢sorry for this generation
At first I was gonna talk shit but damn all respect now my boy actually put some effort into this, haven’t seen these rappers get out the comfort zone or try something different in a minute
Man this shit is trash asf 🤣🤣🤣
This shit is ASS
What is Uganda flag doing there 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
CHOPPAAAAA Sssuuuuuucks. This dude is whack and his music...if you can call it that. Is very low bar.
Lol NLE sent a message  while making us laugh
Untouchable, Unstoppable
Please remove the South African flag we don't support your sh*t
Ppl can say what they wabt about pac. That he was an actor, that he was on the downlow. This, that, whatever, but they can never see hed rap over this corney ass chorusss
Yb better 🐍
He waited for NLE to cime out, He went first,went hard and raised the bar so unnecessarily high... Am sure i chris brown, Tyson, Ali
He finally made it in masonry
Long live 2pac❤🎉😂. NLE versions🎉❤
4.5 million views in 5 days is crazy
He has the same flow like 2pac in Hit em up
The west coast vaibs
So NLE choppa is obviously gay now, was he turned out?
Ok NBA Young boy is on the clock ⏰
I’m so damn happy I don’t fuck with Youngboy
New fan here

I like the creativity just don’t kno what message u trying to send
Who came after janny video 🇪🇹🇪🇹
Honest question: Is he blaspheming? English isn’t my first language and especially with his accent I can’t understand everything perfectly. In the beginning when he’s running he says „YHWH“ in his breath which is the name of the Lord and later in 0:26 I don’t understand what he says about Jesus and the devil and someone who is king. Can someone help? Hope he’s not trying to make fun of Jesus! God bless
Murdered that brotha
Clean up on isle 3 ****
who came after janny video 🇪🇹
The dancing with the volume muted is fucking killing me
Was he dissing NBA Yb?
Yes sir
Why the South African flag ? Just wondering

Live from South Africa 🇿🇦
Jwale South Africa e kena kae?
🔥🔥🔥🔥😮‍💨
4ktry 💚👎🏾
Can anybody here who's honest enough to admit that they're an NBA Youngboy fan tell me how you think NLE the Great  isn't the better lyricist and overall artist?   I don't listen to today's young from-the-streets rap artists because quite frankly their music is trash and (NBA Youngboy is the most absolutely overrated artist that I'm aware of), so I wasn't familiar with NLE the Great either, but I can say he puts thought into his lyrics and in this video he showed fearlessness in expression.   I will never understand what the noise around NBA Youngboy is all about.
You can’t be dissing someone when you do the same thing you promote violence, u promote s!x b, sexualize your video and women, you doing demonic stuff in your video like this one so get u bold head ahh out of her yb Better
I lost my parents early, I’ve been an orphan since I was 12. I have two younger siblings that I raise on my own and, even with all this weight, I still believe in my dream of making a living from music. Sometimes it feels impossible for a kid from the favela to go far, but I keep going… because I know God doesn’t give a dream to someone who can’t make it come true. 🙏 If you can listen to me, I swear every word comes from the soul. ❤❤
Shyt kinda catchy
His momma ain’t no gangster she wrote this song
This isn’t studio beef 😂 ppl getting it twisted. Someone gonna leave the earth when young boy and nle clash. This is never going away. Someone is gonna die

Who's here to watch jhonny vlog from ethiopia 🇪🇹
He literally finished him on All levels! NBA better know how to rap 🤣
A lot of the video went over people‘s head. The Michael Jackson and Tupac reference was because everybody kept comparing him to those two of being great so he just thrown in look like Muhammad Ali and other people who was images of great to me the Michael Jackson dance with the red jacket was because he was referencing demon time, but saying we all in the same struggle, not just him
OFICIALLY NLE FAN ❤
This might be one of the best disses all time. He really went off on yb. Yb can't do any better than this. The video is straight fire and I don't think yb has it in him
😮
😮👀
Honestly if he get stepped on by YB I actually wouldn’t mind because he did the same shit YB did by poising the Youth and he literally kept saying that was his favorite Rapper and that’s who inspired him 😂😂
😮
😮
This like the emperor's new clothes. Don't nobody wanna say this video is gay until one person say out loud this video is hella gay
Nikka don't know if he want to be Tupac or Michael Jackson ain't this the same dude regardless used to beat up and put his hands on his BM 😂😂 NLE ZESTY
Ts so ass😂bald bih 🧑🏿‍🦲
Ima keep it real…that shit creative asf!
NGL this dope one rt tho NLE Tha Great ripped the shit outta of this song this gonna be a big major deal
thank u fa this mane yb finna drop heat fs 🔥🔥🔥
Bro didn’t no who he wanted to be… Michael, pac, Muhammad Ali  wtf is going… stop doing powder Gang…
AYEEEEEEEEE
I get what he tried to do the visuals  and everything he stole from Tupac Michael Jackson and Kendrick Lamar. 😂💯💯💯pretty much what kendrick Lamar did to Drake but it wasn’t even close this is a disaster
DAMMIT MAN #BOSS💎💎💎
😂😂😂
The audacity you had for this shit is FRYING ME
Instead of directing this energy towards one person how about confronting the systems in place that even socially engineered a character such as a “Kentrall” (cause there’s plenty more of them) or a “Bryson” but you not gone do that cause those systems helps write your check for this cheesy ass video imitating ppl who have already lived their lives AS THEM.
wow that was pure artistry displayed. holy shit
I like the music video it's very creative NLE a true performer
Chris brown leChoppa  lol
I like the song fr😭🤣😭I’ll ignore the vid till it grows on me 😭🤣
bro literally did the same shit as yb and now it’s a problem. the same cornball who got exposed by his moms for portraying a false image. 🤡🤡not defending yb but i’ve never seen such a blatant cash grab on the ngas name😂😂
You're next YoungBoy forever
I’m loving this NLE  Chopper us just showing the YN’s how rap and hip hop beef is really suppose to be without guns and violence. It’s all about entertainment but we so use to someone getting killed we forgot
Tough 🤌🏿
Am I right in saying this feels like hopsin flow ?
This the same person who said “if I was a bad b*tch I’d wanna f*ck me too…b*tch let me nut on your butt” ???? he runs around hopping into different persona and now his current one wants to posture itself as some sort of corrective force. This is very unserious and insincere. And as creative as this is I just can’t take it beyond that. And what’s with the black and white floors? NBA youngboy is not your opponent.  weird.
I ain’t gonna lie Yb probably seeing this shit and laugh his ass off because I am. we need all these gimmicks just to make a diss song now
Dude turned into Will Smith
He still ain’t fw yb 🚮2pac wouldn’t approve this ✈️2️⃣holiday shii

Idc what nobody say this is real art and music you can’t hate the creativity you have to give bro his credit 😅 no disrespect to NBA YOUNGBOY but his music videos don’t look like this and you can actually understand it
Great Video. I am old school and never really listened to NLE. But now I am going back and checking it out. He changed though. I can tell. Someone has given and shown him some LIGHT!!!!!
This is disturbing. Are you ok?
❤❤
What in the Micheal Jackson /Chrisbrown with a dash of PAC is this 😂😂😂😂
🇩🇴
N.l.e recently said how he found God this track ain't on tbe side of forgiveness and good will lol but its still one of the best tracks hip hops had for a while
NLE CHOPPA THE GOAT 🔥  NBA YOUNGAYBOY FAKE GANGSTER  🤣
Not really appreciated hip hop these days since tbe genius died in 97 it lost its spark but I kinda like this one was never a big Tupac fan but this is pretty good just hope it doesn't cause any tir for tat violence as long as it's kept to the music
This was a home run for NLE ! Str8 🔥 🔥 💯
NLE is Chris brown and micheal jackson😂
Let's goooooooooo nle 😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭😭
This is why Hip Hop record sales has plummeted.  Black Gen Z is doing everything in their power to destroy and bastardize Hip Hop culture.  Everything that Black Gen X’ers and Millennials built has been torn down and dumped on by this current generation.  This was more of a diss to Pac, LL and Mike than it was to Young Boy.   Rap music should be more politically charged today but instead we have homo thugs dissing each other.  The culture is done 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
NLE  this was fire but please don’t bring it to the streets
Ya kill it
Is he saying yahweh at the end? Hell nah fuck this shit fr
NLE this is fire
Banger
💋💋🔥🔥🔥🔥 just fire!!!!! I love him and this video! !!! He killed it!!!
Y B bettter
Wtf I just watch… my brain is so confused 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I can’t lie this shit is 🔥🔥🔥

I wish someone would have done this to lil Wayne so we wouldn’t have so many low vibrational copies like we do today smh
Retire already
Verse 3 pac would of been proud of this message. Protect our women

Not sure what we doing here but it kind of hits lol, NLE is a TRUE entertainer doe 💯
I’m not fw this 😂😂 I’m sorry but this not it

If you peep his verse @2:15 he sounded just like YB 😂
This really hard all bs aside and creative
Zesty
I wonder if NLE choppa has seen the godfather. Do you remember  how Don Vito dies? He pretends to be a monster and chases his grandson around, has a heart attack and dies. He died playing a game
How you make a diss record an dancing ? 😂.  This is too funny 😂😂😂
😭😭😭😭😭 im fkn speechless, aint neva seen no shit like this before, im jus so confused 😭😭😭😭 help 🥹
😂😂😂 yooo this got me weakkkkk
Nah. The visuals were cool, but he rapping like Melle Mel. Play the video and put your phone down
NLE just mad he switched off his fake gangster flow and isn’t top 5 artists like yb. He made the same type of music as yb before and he hasn’t taken it down. NLE just big and greedy
This is 💥
Is you future Michael Jackson
i don't how many times I've listened to K.O so far.....this is pure creativity & lastly I hope South Africans saw their flag🇿🇦amapiano dance to the world
NLE can make 100 youngboy disses and the day yb even drop a 5 second ig story replying NLE aura poof gone like magic

NLE is far more talented then YB...
YB need to just take the L. Nothing he says is gon land right. NLE called him breastfed, then YBs mama jumped out the window to squabble up for him. G.O. imo.
Blow the head of yo neck like dandelion 😮wo
He gotta get the troll of the year award😂

Yo why you got a South African flag on this trash ass song, why involve South Ahh in your bull shit Dawg?
2pac ❌ NLE✅📈
Kids bop ah song nle the cornball 😂
Do I hear a faint melody of tupac's 'Hit Em' Up' ??
“I’m inlove with the art, he taring people apart” this video deems that true fr. Gotta be inlove with the art to make a video like this.. also you far from “broke” or “falling off” making a video like this for sure 🔒🔒
This video had me completely confused from the start
This is it bro. Keep spreading truth and love ❤

Real talk. Out of all the rappers in past decade. Yall been pissing me the F off with the classic remixes and samples, with your lazy work ethics. But this right here? Is how you do it! Do it as good or better than original or get the F out! Appreciate how he updated pacs flow.
How isn't this considered gay af?
South Africa 🇿🇦 to the world

The reason why he was Michael Jackson and Tupac and Mike Tyson they fought for the kids and the people, and they spoke let that sink in yall it’s not about beef. It’s about saving sometimes you have to delete pollution Michael Jackson 2Pac spoke about the youth and the government and the people. Why do you think those two are not here why do you think Mike Tyson don’t speak at all  the other kids different nations and the celebrities have all this money, but they can’t donate to other countries is there a commercials at 2 o’clock talking about donate to Africa donate donate to this country. Donate to the country that one 800 number

I had to hear the song without seeing the video cause tough talk , dancing and glitter doesn’t go together  speaking for my generation #myopinion
Nle If you seeing this do not do anything to young boy he not off probation he still being supervised I even look it up and it says that
I never seen anyone as good as NLE, being a gangster, follow a choreography as well as he does!  While trying to diss someone?    🤣🤣🤣
Bro motivated me to shave my head and spazz on niggas
🔥🔥🔥
you doing all this on a checkerboard floor the industry took yo choppa cheeks on a platter and you let them just shutup bro and go back to chakkra NLE
YESSSIR we fw this
Choppa the goat for this #Freesmurk
What possessed him to write, record, and then proceed to film the corniest video of the decade thus far
The black and white checker floor says a lot already
2Pac The Great🎉
He cooked!
Corny trash
Youngboy wont cross the line his scared
I know you have a kid and the society is crazy but gng you might as well make this the official time you are back from 2024- and half of 2025
Bro Ts tuff g
how come you weren’t rapping like this when you had hair gang..
All bullshit, and goofy shit aside, this is war, and someone is going to die behind this, the beat is fire, and bro got bars, but just like hit’’em up, this can only end badly for either or both sides.
wtf is going on
2024: Kendrick Lamar vs Drake 2025:NLE Choppa vs NBA YoungBoy  2026:??
This the same energy that got tory laid to rest by Dax
Why is he tryna be tupac, and Michael Jackson at the same time bro stop😭😭😂
????????? Wat is going on here
ts ass
There’s not a single bar in this song
Yooooo  nlw wooow that’s some real shit right here !!!
At 2:18 the message is hard. The choreography from those lovers and their children is beautiful. Taking charge and making him walk away like that is art.
😂😂😂 man wtf is this. PAC and MJ pissed
It’s a different nle every year 😤😮‍💨🔥
How did I end up in this universe and how can I get back to where I belong ..this is toucher I don’t know how much longer I can endure this nonsense !!!!!
Clean up on isle trey 😆

2:33 😂😂
This shit caught me off guard and I didn't like it at first but it's growing on me it's like an r&b almost typa rap
Finally a rapper being an artist and not just a rapper!! Loved this and heard the msg loud n clear!! Yall have a platform to express one self in the industry but never forget our children are watching and listening. What you give out, our children give back. Keep it real, keep it creative and keep it in the studio. The man bro!! Been waiting years for yall to use your musical talent to make creative art especially in the hip hop industry. Love it!
This song better than video
Daddy Choppa

This shit ass
this is similar to 2pacs hit em up not only in the beat but the way he flowed especially the chorus which in 2pacs hit em up it was "get out the way yo get out the way yo biggie smalls just got dropped"
Boy use a cash money beat to diss youngboy man birdman aint gon like that
What’s with all the gay dancing.  first two verses about killing and shooting then you talk about how that’s bad in the 3rd verse….  imo they both nle and nba are terrible representation of people and culture but I don’t listen to them just heard of this and had to check it out.
This was pretty creative
Ts like a rhcp music video
Very creative
Ngl I’m not a Yb fan but this Diss is mad corny.. it would have been a decent song and good music video if you take that away seems as if he trying to be like Kendrick Lamar
Shit trash

Ngl nigga spitting facts how niggas jam young boi and wanna kill some these young people nowadays got the wrong frame mind 💯we all kill but only for protection for our family 💯
This went triple cardboard.
Verses are fire but this video is GAY AF!
Im convinced all the hate towards this track is based on the fact those individuals never listen to the message just a a beat and auto tune. They clearly never listened to Pac or Nas or the real shit they said. I hear a heavy influence of Pac in this.
Gotta use yb to stay relevant, wasn’t you fanned out too?
Tory Lanze Killed this 😅
Bro, this ninja woke up and choose violence 😂😂😂😂 ("NBA, you might wanna lay low little dude")
Interesting video cool song
This is truly different! The creativity in this video is amazing! Wow

What the world omg
Idccc, still team #youngboy
Nah People just hating cuz he ate this up!!!
Food for the soul bro.  Thanks. I needed that done❤❤
Yeah bro went in
Purple lights. Checker board floor. This is not “just because” its deeper than the music
Repent Jesus Is Coming Soon
As an old head I first said wtf, but then I thought this guy just outartisted another man
One of the best diss songs and one of the most creative Ive heard or seen in years no lie
The way you holding yb head was insane 😂😂
I'm talking bout I fuck wit YB music so tough.. NLE got him oooooone 😂❤
The best diss of international trap world
NBA is TRASH. Hate his message, hate his style. Definitely think he sold his soul and is NOT a follower of Jesus Christ. So I approve this message
Rutssssssss
Wtf is this and why he sound like that 😐
I don’t even f with NLE but have to give the boy props… he don’t stop… can’t not but like the hustle.. you keep pushing your art to new heights I appreciate the outcome, this what music needs!
8
TOP better  This shit fire tho
IDC what anyone says I like it 😅😂
Bruhhhhhhh he killed this shidddd🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
I can’t lie this song and video was lit. The video was very creative
I talked to YB He's going to hurt this man so when it happens remember it's coming
the goat
Refreshin !
No bullshit, I respect the confidence and self acceptance that it takes to publicly share the progression of your own image like this. When people pop out unexpectedly doing something that solely feels right to them it reminds me to embrace becoming a new version of yourself. I hope some of yall reading this feel the same way! ☮️
video top tier. bars low tier.
So he gay now?
Black and White checkerboard? 😏
This shit gas ⛽️
Iam sorry young boy won’t have time to see this he’s so far ahead having tours 😂😂😂😂😂 keep pushing young boy!!!!

Someone spoke to Kendrick Lamar for advice
You say NBA YoungBoy is your favorite rapper man your stuff is whack like dude I actually like you, but this just made me mad.  young boy finna rock  your stuff

Finally a good black rapper is saying the important shit that all the corny white rappers been sayin
This would b a cool single but diss bro Yu look like a clown smh trying b Kendrick b yaself Yu trying b a 100?people n dis video smdh
This is very creative
Song 🔥🔥 video 🔥🔥
Dude... This is rap history
NLE sacrificing himself to save our communities from the violence cycle.   You have to take off the head and the body dies 🐍
Father pls do not let this make it to a dangerous situation and keep these to people distance
NLE Choppa is an ARTIST and performer. Respect.
That shit was hard 😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Gang is not 2pac💔💔💔
People think this is just a diss, but it’s way deeper. NLE Choppa isn’t dissing for clout he’s holding a mirror to NBA YoungBoy and everything toxic about what he represents. He’s calling out how YB made pain, violence, and broken families look cool and how that energy’s been killing the culture specially black culture from the inside. The “Yahweh bomba ye” line isn’t random; it’s spiritual warfare. Choppa’s saying, “You’re glorifying darkness while I’m trying to wake the kids up.”   The reason he dressed up as Ali, Tyson, and MJ is to show what real legacy looks like men who inspired change, not chaos. This track is a warning that you need to evolve or get left behind.
yall know jay told nle to pop his shit
Close your eyes and listen....NLE has some nice bars on this one. Nice diss.💯
They ain't hearing the message battle dat force 🔥
Bravery
I miss old nle
😭😭 nigga got bots in the comments because no way they saying this revolutionary and this the same nigga who said “if I was bad bitch I’d fuck me too”
Bro said fuck Memphis lmao
I'm leaving this comment here because after a month,  years and decades if someone likes this comment I get reminded of this song
Insane .
Bars too weak for me.
2 pac cadence and flow now I get why he shaved his head
ts bald nga tryna beef wit tha goat cs yu not relevant no mo 😂😂
Y.b don't have vocabulary to keep up yall funny
Dance moves 🔥
Is this mudafuka gay?
My boy is actually saying something and people hate to hear the truth and facts so I get the hate 💯  just dont let it get to you, dont trip my guy 💯  this whole message, song, and video is fueggooooo 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is 🗑, Zesty ass battle rap! 😤 😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Bad ass, he went from Mohammed Ali, to Michael Jackson, to Mike Tyson while keeping homage and the spirit of 2Pac and the video is bad ass. Good job 👍🏻👏🏻
“All in the videos dancing! Come to Death Row!”
If he keeps this hunger and adds a little soul in the music, bro is going up

If you can’t see the clear devil worshiping & illuminati signals in this then your eyes is glued closed. Nle choppa is fully bought into the Illuminati and is ready to take his career to the next level.  He’s gonna rot in hell with all the other rappers

BTA is diabolical 😂😂😂😂

It's art! ... Not a diss..... genuine art ..  he over emphasized that in the lyrics ....... The Media needs to chill out..... They are the ones causing the war in the streets and it's a lot of  white streamers spreading the negative ...

Checkered floor …. Illuminati
He's trying to out perform Not like us lo😂😂😂
This the track we PLAY after FINALLY GTA6 releases 😁
DOPE VID MAN
Yall so slow, it’s sad. Two things can be true at once. Yall don’t know controlled opposition if they had it on his face. He literally promotes everything he dissed. While also mentioning the same shit in the song and being a fake gangster. Sheeple 😂
Cooking dinner, dancing and jamming to this. Love when a diss track bops this hard, with just as hard punches
Wat are him and YB beefing for?
ngl the lyricism is meaningful and as a creative myself i super respect his creative growth. visual storytelling with any track u make goes a long way
I fw it  But be ready for nba come back 😅 because just as good as the music video is he wil drop more to say then a music video famo round 1 starts now guys
I love it
What happened to NLE what even is this? Bro dressed and dancing like michael jackson and dissing the guy he made 2 songs about freeing from jail? Bruh bring NLE choppa camelot back idk who this fruit loop is. 😭😭
🤔
Wheeee weee
Love the beat and his sound but some of his moves be so gay lol pick bro, be gangsta or gay. To mix them both it becomes a whole situation. Got luv for you tho ❤️
Waste of money
Ali bomaye that set it on fire
Ayeee not my girl Erica cleaning up aisle trey lol

What’s wrong with this guy?
You tried but stay in your lane d rider
NBA in the stu plotting rn.
Nba is friend for this one bro
He is speaking up as a father and a rapper spreading the word. Youngboy makes for music men who have no values who believe heavily in making more kids and leaving<< poisons  kids brains into into normalizing disgusting behaviour. NLE🫶🏾
KO🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This my 10th time watching this. I’m just trying to make sure I don’t miss any hidden moments lol
😂😂😂😂
🥷🏿 u a clown 😂
NLE is an amazing entertainer… taking chances and risk love it
This shit is wak af 😂
Yall not listing or watching the symbols he trying to tell yall sum
I’m not gonna lie to you. You wanna be Tupac so bad but you can’t be too bop.
Just let your boy have it not you I am so disappointed.😮
nle choppa who got yu doing this bro
I haven't heard dis since 90s 😅
Visuals evoke remembrance of ancestral trauma meanehile NLE glorifies violence, specifically towards members of his own community.
You reap what you sow Nle choppa remember the"there just grillz” you did the same thing to him act like you didn’t want anything to do with him
hopefully yb blick him up
Not gone lie this go in
Dis nga disses yb while tryna be like tupac and called “nlethegreat” gtf somewhere😂
Rip nle
Don´t try to be 2pac don´t forget that he died because of it.
Drake who? 😂
When they take over your soul so you can make it as big as the one you dissing.... Jealousy all over this video he dont  even sound like him self. That ritual he took it all making sense now.

This got over 4 million view
Eskistaaaa
TRASH
I get the message. I just don’t get the subliminals. You are the better artist. He has the people’s attention. Put people in their place humbly and respectfully. Jesus would NEVER
There are so many fake ass AI comments on here lol
this is so good but yb might come back but this go so hade
We need the old nle back
Love the video 🎉
repent from your sins and turn to Jesus Christ he's coming soon!❤️‍🔥who ever call on the name of the lord will Be saved!

Brahhhh I need to be in the next video this bih went hard af cuhh

If you listen to the songs lyrics, you actually see that NLE got something to important to say. Plus the video is dope.  Usually I shit on the new generation of rappers. But I actually like this dudes music.

That was a waste of time people staff video and everything else it was too much going on in the video  I'm very disappointed that you use Tupac and then the great Dennis..it seems like you was galavanting around stage a rendition of cats Broadway show was better than that. And at the same time you licking your tongue out gangster😂😂 girl no competition welcome to Hell's kitchen can you smell what YB is cooking that was the last supper for you bouty boy  trash 🗑️...YB  get'em show him the definition of Ryder😂😂😂😂
Man IDC what anyone says, this man puts all his soul into his music
This dont even deserve a reply lol😂
Him taking the cigar away from YB and dissing him is what got me
top shotta forever
He think he Michael Jackson now lol
This gas asf tho fr 😂😂😂👌
Why you sound like a poor little puppy dog. Get a grib and you’ll get there.
Tupac would be proud no rap🫡
Theatrics I don't like but the message is on point i understand the meaning. Young Boy is Selling Out His Own People for $$$$
i-wanna-cry-the-best-song-i-heard
This sucks he mad because nba young better tf     He needs to stop making statements about his beef with them little boys
If you don't like the song cool but the man is saying things that is going above y'all head don't let the video distract you from the message
Idk if he meant to put this in i assume he would but in the beginning it sounds like he is saying " yahweh " hebrew name of God
Ever since the episode he was on with Kirk Franklin he been on one 😂
He KO'D NBA FR I'm seeing 4m views😅
If any 90s hip heads in here how y'all feel about this track.

OKAYYY NLE 💃🕺
That was so creative! And "Don't Look Any Further" is my JAM
Hilarious video. Didn't find the diss that hard though. I laughed uncomfortably for the duration of the video it was a fun watch for sure. The track gets better and better the more you listen, ngl.
You stirring up trouble because your label
This shit soo 💩
South Africa and Uganda flag?
Mj choppa❤
& this 💩 🗑! 🤣 🚮
This the first time a rapper summoned a spiritual incantation w/ a praise dance to diss another rapper. Spiritual warfare in art form. The duality of goofy yet dead serious. I love to see it!
Reminds me of Kendrick’s album
..With the checkerboard floor! 😒 #iykyk
This shit ass
Ts never seeing 100m
Yb still better 🫸
Choppa u gotta be trolling

The rap gang finna wrap up youngboy behind clothes doors and his fame is gunna poor through the roof it’s finna be the biggest talked about
What's the meaning of the Ugandan and South African flags in this video
Nle clean up on aile Tray I was saying that before you make this
Why does this remind of Doja Cat
Reminds me a lot of Tupac…:..
This whole thing was ass to me. Yes I understood his message.  Yes, he did have some valid points, but I think the song and the video was whack , and he’s corny to the point where the youth will miss the message by him being so fucking corny
🎉
Welp ig that nigga got the clout he wanted 😂
I swear I never heard a song that actually meant something from young boy besides lonely child everything he rap about is killing but his generation likes it n buys it so that's why constantly sells n breaks records but a win is a win no matter what 😂 I don't know neither one of them but get ya money both of y'all however 😂
I fw it great art ma boi
Bro has so much demonic symbolism is this video…
Nle im pulling up on you gng watch out brudda
Dope song ❤❤
as above so below gesture, black and white checkered floors, sus outfit in the beginning, devil getting spanked....here is another soul gone if it wasn't already. lil nas x energy
Gay Ooooo, Gay Oooooo
People say Pac i say it reminds me more of Dennis Edwards version far as the chorus
this shi so ass
Listen, I just wanna say this once you don’t know what NBA YoungBoy have been through for him to make all them gangsta songs you switching up just prove that you was a fake gangster. You’re disrespecting him. You used to call him the best rapper life now you switching up just because you wanna be like Tupac and biggie please cut your shit. You know what you’re dealing with. This is bad for you.
The ending**😂😂😂😂
NLE g uu came in hot on king David
Average a million views a day so far is AMAZING
Lyrically he snapped but visually he failed miserably
💥🔥
This African air bender needa chill before lord yb really do it to him

This track goes hard! Video epic!
One of the weirdest videos I've ever seen and honestly I'm worried...The fact that I'm reading MAD comments and NOBODY is pointing it out is freaking me out...I think I'm really done with Rap...I'm going to stick with Hip-Hop...Them boys In Hollywood really did a number on our culture...SMFH!!!
Protect this Man AT ALL COST!!!! lol
Cant even lie, this just made me a NLE Fan lol.........its different, its unique, & shows a different level of woke! you got my attention fashoooo !
Checkered floor play attention
For all the culture vultures that let “NLE Boombyay” fly over their heads how dare you if you don’t know that reference it’s from one of Muhammad Ali last fights if I’m not mistaken it was the THRILLA in Manila the crowd was chanting “Ali Boombyyay” which translates to “Ali Kill him”
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
KO
I like too see nle and tory lanes on a track together now this is 🔥
Hard asf
If you know you know 😂😂😂😂
For makin statements choosing sides about my beef with them lil boys
It's been nearly 5 days since he dropped this diss video and I still can't remember one hot line. 😐
wow 😲 , thx for recognizing Uganda 🇺🇬  with a flag , am your fun from Uganda 🇺🇬
this is the worst diss I ever heard on God wtf you doing cuh
pure art
Unmatched  right now   The creativity blows my mind  And I see my south african home flag
Instagram brought us here 😂
I'm an avid Tupac fan, have been since he was originally MC New York, and Yafeu, Malc, etc were Dramacydal, before they got their alias's & became Thug Life, then The Outlawz. To me, Pac was a genius. I will always defend facts, no hearsay.  But, every 1 saying NLE is using "Hit Em Up" , the answer is yes & no. Pac ACTUALLY sampled a song called "Don't look any futher" by Dennis Edwards (1982) as the main melody & also "loosely"wanted to imitate "Get Money" Junior Mafia. A lot of OG hiphop/rap tracks sampled older tracks. We all know diss tracks are meant to pack a lyrical punch, with undertones of facts/roasting & threats. But, i will say, in my personal experience (as I've not seen/heard EVERY diss track ever recorded by every artist) THIS video to accompany KO, is 1 of the only ones I can think of which is clearly influenced by Pac's hit em up. We know Pac had fire lyrics, and meant every word, but the video content/context was satire. The lookalikes, wigs, and more, was an evident comical roasting moment.  TBH, for its day, pure genuis. Video portraying a different narrative to the heartfelt, Pack a punch, intentional diss. Even now, hit em up is loved by younger generations. So, whilst NLE has clearly been influenced by Pac, he hasn't copied anything. It's NLEs lyrics, concept, story, and work that resulted in this. I don't usually like "newer" disses (as opposed to 80/90 Cubes No Vaseline is another classic) but, credit where credits due. I like this. The video has an old school vibe to it too. Also @NLEtheGreat is that a Death Row Chain I noticed on you? I couldn't see properly, as just watching on my phone for quickly for now. If it IS, you got an OG west side chain right there ☺☺ Keep being you & keep giving us more like this !!! 🔥
Freaky Freaky beef 🍖

The tupac inspired fit is dope, where can i find it?
🔥🔥🔥 Portugal 🤝🏻
18 century vibes like fr
right, i like nle choppa and youngboy so no hate but i dont think this beef makes any sense , Because in one verse he is talkin bout yb songs makin people kill and stuff but all he is doing is makin songs , if the people wanna kill thats they decision not him. im from the Bahamas and the people on my island love him alottt, more than me . His songs help them thru bad nd hard times , like gravity, i know , lonely child etc . so my opinion i dont think he is a bad artist. now this song, i like the beat its tuff but the dissin was not necessary. i js still think it doesnt make any sense . i hope yall understand where im comin from nd not goin to get on my case , im js sayin my opinion . if yall do i dont think i coming back to this vid so .
BRO  Damnnnnnnn bro you kinggggggggggg yahhh
He is positive and solving in mature way dmn 🔥

This Nigga is brave I give him that🎉😂
Ngl this prolly the most creative diss tracks I seen choreographed 😭😭😭
King von😢😢
So yhu wait three years to diss yb ?? Ik yb coming wit a banger fr
After analyzing the video, I’ve come to understand that NLE Choppa’s message goes far deeper than surface-level entertainment or petty disses. This track feels like a mirror held up to the culture — a commentary on how we constantly compare and tear down our own instead of celebrating each other’s greatness. When you think about it, NLE’s using strong figures like Michael Jackson, Tupac, Muhammad Ali, and Mike Tyson to highlight a recurring issue: we constantly debate who’s “better,” even when both individuals are legends in their own right. Whether it’s music, sports, or culture, we often turn greatness into competition rather than collective inspiration. The line “since y’all want me to decease him” captures that perfectly — it speaks to how the culture thrives off conflict. People crave drama instead of peace; they want NLE and NBA YoungBoy to clash rather than coexist. But this song flips that expectation. It calls out not just others, but NLE himself, acknowledging his own flaws and moments where he may have misled or fallen short. That self-awareness and honesty make the record powerful. It’s a call for unity, growth, and accountability — a reminder that if brothers came together and engaged in healthy competition instead of destructive rivalry, our communities would thrive. So if I interpreted the message differently, my apologies to NLE — but either way, the song is deep, meaningful, and necessary. It challenges the cycle and reminds us to elevate, not divide.
NLE a puppet of the powers that be as well. He taking the opportunity to bring his self back relevant. All u have to do is really break down the signs and imagery in this video. NLE serving his masters with this one as well. Learn duality.
Yb meat munchers working overtime defending him
🌽🌽😂😂  And I don't even fw Yb like that anymore.
Lame ash
wow
This the same guy who’s cool with Durk so I don’t respect the hypocrisy . Everything he’s saying in this song also applies to Durk as well !
Let’s see what happens next
YB stay in yo cave, you cant win this beef againts NLE. :D NO FCKING WAY
I appreciate the creativity but this shit TRASH❗️
Took bro 6yr to clap back
This really is a KO, you have to actually listen to the words attached to the visual art, ain’t no picks here,both artists have their own style, but the visuals artistry he brought to this track fire, I was hesitant at first before listening,comprehending and watching it through because it seemed a little 👋 no offense but he captured it✌🏾✌🏾💯✅
🔥🔥
You not pac dude😂

Slide for king von fr
This some clout chasing ass shit I get it tho ain’t hit a consistent 2mil in years
im so sick of people dtm on NLE Honestly if you ask me NLE spoke all truth if you really listen and understand. If you listen to a song Yb did a few years ago he dissed alot of people like NLE and O block yk King von, Now king von and NLE was close asl. You know hella people dont take dissing king von or even O block period lightly. And the whole " you poisoning the youth, you the reason dudes is beating females thinking that its cute " Its true. If you listen to Yb songs you cant sit up here and say he is a positive type of person. ALOT of Yb fans are teens or people in they 20s. BUT people can say the same thing about NLE because when he first came out with songs like " Final Warning " and " Walk em down " that was not good for no kids to be listening to. but NLE been on this positive stuff for a while now, Yb on the other hand still talk about the guns and thugs and drugs. Now since Yb is top of the charts and stuff right now and he on tour and all that more teens is going to see his shows and looking on what i see everyday (cuz im still in high school) boys sit up here acting like they hard and thugs, they smoke, they bring fake guns to school. and ( not saying all ) but most of them listen to Yb. NLE was a fan of Yb when he first came out and wanted to do a song wit him and he even came out wit a song " Free Yb " or sum like dat then out of nowhere Yb dissed him so..thats were the beef started. And its prob way deeper then that but i do know for sure he prob waited cuz Yb was in jail for a while plus as u can see the video is well planned out. HONESTLY Im team NLE all day everyday cause I been listening to him for years and listen to him way more. I like Yb to but I feel like NLE is better. BUT THATS JUST ME dont come for me.
Hit ‘Em Up beat and flow - the Tupac nod 🙂‍↕️
Nah fr what was the point of this??
damn
Bro…. Better keep the beef within diss tracks instead irl shooting each other dont take it too far….

r.i.p
Don't appreciate the beef this might possibly bring, but Appreciate the art. Very creative for a rapper
I respect him for exposing nba. He reminds me of Wayne. Shallow music

I've seen this creative in rap in a minute!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
He was better off just coming out with this song n not dissing nobody because the youth been poisoned with these rap lyrics since before he was born and ain’t nun gone change unless the world start listening to gospel rap it’s just the way of the world in my opinion if it was meant for the world to not have negativity n beef it would of never ever been thought of n the human nature and universe this shit still slap tho
I'm big on creativity 👌 and this is precise
u whanted to be yongboy so i dont know what u on
This is the dumbest video video ive ever seen. U can tell some gay white dude said" come out like mike Jackson " then put on all these outfits play dress up thats so tough
قاعد اسمعها وانا بالنيابه والله ياشوبا خالعه الاغنيه هههخخخخ

This new generation has to remake/copy the past from beats to who they identify with because they truly lack creativity. These young new artists literally kill classic songs , doing a remake all the time. This kid has never spoken about being a Tupac and Michael Jackson fan but for clicks, content, and attention , we getting this mid. Jit lame for this and everything be about to attention for him. This new generation is cooked
Why some people ain't hearing the message
Am I gay if I like this ……….
Sta8ght fire
Art. Smoked that shit. 🔥
This not it😂😂
Everything bro said about yb is true tho
😂😂 this shit garbage

🫰＼(^o^)／
Idk y'all I'm fucking with it he was baring up on this on video was fire too
He ate I fear ❤ and the Erica cami 😘
Jahnny  😁😁
I think there should be a full investigation. We don't believe this guy. How are you going to promote violence on your own kind but call some one out for hitting women. Makes sense more like top faker
Nah why is this #2 hyped
I came to see this nigga play as Tupac
I like it and the hook honestly
Just a nigga with emotion. A breast fed bitch.. is one of the coldest line I heard. Fire af
It was okay ig 2 much dancing tho
This shit hard as fuck nle but you better looks out people gonna be after you for this one
Bad boy 😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂
Wack.
Giving Daz vibes… entertaining music video tho. 😐
The worst song I ever heard you goofy
Same nigga that made walkem down 😂
Shit ass bro
I can feel the vibes
Of course yb fans won’t get it 🤣🤣 they will even say there is no message 😆 well … in the video he’s channeling the greats like Micheal prince Mohammed Nigerian king Mike Tyson etc( that’s why he change his name)… he also says YB is controlled by  the devil.. “he looking at the devil like this your king “and he is on god side …god is with him and he sent him to take him down… we can bang it out for house nigga and field Nigga meaning we all still niggas ..  he also say he’s cancer he’s  trying to cancel him .. Yb is also  messing the youth up he’s  sending the kids out on crash out dummy mission… something he won’t even do …and before you say music don’t make you  do anything… have you ever listen to a song and it put you in a mood depending on what you listen to..NLE choppa says he doing his part YB needs to do His part … he says god is not happy with him he’s bringing  violence to his children .. at the end he’s running like  Muhammad Ali when he was training for a fight the chant was saying NLE take him down kill him but he doing it lyrically.
Idc idc idc this shit was funny Dope lit and I fucking looooooooove it!
He knew it would get views dissing youngboy
I love the creativity and the message. Wasn't a fan, but I am now
He did this one the words are real he really let people see what’s going on Today❤

i love how he did all the legends in this video (mike tyson - Muhammad ali - Michael jackson - the austrian painter 🫡)
This video sugary ash😂😂
I’m sorry you don’t see creative videos Anymore  and this far exceeds this era of creativity! Good Job to all that was involved
I actually like it
Maaaaan 🔥
Y'all in the comments praising this BS. This is not where it's at total trash, supermane fruity, and very demonic
im not even a huge yb fan but this is 100% rage baiting 🤣 unprovoked, clearly jealousy, and begging for attention from yb, i hope he pays it dust.
Nle is fine af and he killed this shit. He speaking all facts too man. He is poisoning the youth
Gayyyyyyyyyy lol a dance routine diss well he got us talking 😅😅😅😅
If this was yb dissing nle wouldn't nobody be calling it trash😭 yb did that song with bird man and ain't got this many views yet😭
0:38 wtf lol gayest shit ever
U js mad he get more btchs
Why they beefing?
Everyone is scared of yb except for chappa music is always about competition the Atlanta rap just look bad
I think they found their new Lil Nas X
Wow . 👏🏽  No matter the vibe . He literally fills the bottle and puts the seal on that bitch . . Untouchable . And he know that . Salute NLE
Video is wild, y'all know NLE personality is on another level but I'm trying to pay attention to what NLE is spitting in this song.
Trash
Nle say sorry say sorry because you might die bro so that’s the only option you guys to tell your boy you sorry and he won’t get you killed cause you can die like this bro you gotta get off the dark side bro you gotta go with your boy bro I know it’s hard but yeah
This shi so 🔥🔥🔥 and creative
KO TWIN 🎯🔥🔥
Ahhh checkerboard floors and the whooping in the beginning! I see the exact masonic symbolism in that!
Straight ass
“I don't give a fuck 'bout how you treat your body Give a fuck about your cleanin'”
ts hard
The music and the video is not that. Y’all gassin it  and making it seem like it’s the worst song out there and I’ve heard way worse. ￼ nothing he did looked gay. In my opinion. It just look like he likes to dance like Prince or Michael Jackson. It’s sad that it be your own people calling you gay because you just like to dance a certain way meanwhile, Bad Bunny went from being a thug rapper to painting his nails. To me that’s more fruity, but yet he was accepted and became one of the most popular rappers in the Latin community. we did not give a damn as long as the music was good. ￼￼ he may not be this thug dude that y’all used to, but his song and music is not bad.
Yo wtf south african flag doing in the video😂, we aint part of this
Nle Tupac of this gen
2pac vibe 🔥🔥
This song so ass what till yb clap back
Yb worldd I like nba youngboy it’s his worldd

Everybody think yb is untouchable dude a punk
I wonder if he would e had same smoke for his friend king Von or lil durk
Mannnnnnnn WHATTTTTT? Brooooo you have to view NLE differently now. The level of creativity he showed on this song, and the video is so good that you miss out on the lyrics. Idc this was tough. I had no idea this was a diss I haven’t kept up with what’s going on but as I watch this video it’s clear NLE is very talented. 🔥 Video of the year easily. Now I pray they end this beef.
Ugandans gather here😮🇺🇬❤
One of the best, hands down, rap/hip-hop music video I’ve seen in a LOOOONG time!
Put his all into this song , from the message , lyrics, &  scenery … just for yb to not reply or drop a single with no video like “ I hate youngboy “ which will once again climb the charts and surpass his music per usual😂😂
😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡 🔥

I love everything about this video.  I’m 51 years old and not too many videos are truly entertaining like this.  From the lyrics to the artistry and choreography.  I didn’t know much about NLE but I’m a fan now. Whoever put this together is a marketing genius.  One of my favorite videos now.

Bro, can somebody tell me why is NLE Choppa beefing with YoungBoy like?why
FOH nobody YB is not no savior. Mf mad cause he selling out. Honestly you cannot blame another individual for another individual’s actions. Because ultimately it is an individual choice to act. Influence Ok what has NLE done that was note worthy or different from yb catalog. FOH. Dissing for sales is weak. MF so clickish nowadays even this mf NLE. Stop 🛑 and consider what’s good for you and do that shit instead reaching for another mf cup.❤
Let's keep this in the studio we don't need Memphis and new Orleans going at it please. That's to places that do not give a f and has no chill
Real fans let's gather here

Up Coming rapper dissing the GOAT 🐐 😂😂😂😂😂😂. You don't wanna be drilled 😂😂😂 YB is busy n balling, you can only have fame by mentioning his name 😂
@nlethegreat keep spreading the message 🔥🔥🔥
2:41 new dance on EVERYBODY SOUL WE ALL hitting at function and parties😪
Nle found out something about nba that made him comfortable dissing him finally💯 maybe it is that all nba full of feens only criminal record he has is being a rapper lol he’s fans got weak knees and dope feens. Catch em slippin🥷
I forgot about Lil Durk
YB raps garbish/mumble rap and NLE actually raps
I like this new NLE
"I'm in love with the art, he tearing people apart" are ya'll really listening to this shit🔥🔥 ??
Yb bettet
Catchy

What about that checkered floor there bud 🤦‍♂️🤣
I like it ....a good GEN Z rap beef😊
Omg if this doesn't solidify in the music industry!! I like seeing you be yourself <3
I hope that this beef doesn’t end in violence or death but if those that know, NLE Choppa and YoungBoy been had beef when they first came out NBA YoungBoy was dissing NLE Choppa first this was years ago, though and NLE Choppa wasn’t worried about that shit you know what I’m saying so NLE Choppa didn’t start this shit autumn threats. The NBA YoungBoy was saying towards NLE Choppa and ain’t shit happened.
I read all these comments and man y’all muthafuckas are on his dick because this was bullshit this shit makes me not want to listen to music
Daaaaamn!!!!
He had all the analogies of The 90s Greats but he missed MJ 23,  how he forget the most correlating brand. NBA
Let me get this right has anybody watched the new 60 minutes that was dropped on Michael Jackson 🙄🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️ 👀👀👀👀👀
Dudes going out like MGK wit dis one
Young boy way better this shit sound sooo trash what the f*** kind of flow is this this s*** is trash
This shit is dookie water 💦💦💦
shout out to NLE..... Uganda Representing Purple all the way up
Just because it’s “creative” doesn’t mean it’s good. Yall keep saying it’s art. So what??? This shit is trash. And I don’t even like YoungBoy.
NLE PAC
YB the most overrated artist of all time
LlKingVon
"Used To Underestimate NLE, But This Fire Fr".🔥🫡
Ayyy creativity 💯 could of done just another “rap video” with the cars and the girls. The shit that used to make us actually want to watch the music videos …. MTV days 😂
This is trash there's is nothing nicer abouts this hating ass fan why all of a sudden he dissing YB like come on bro stop it and then the diss song is hot trash take the L on this one Choppa you honestly sound stupid and jealous
Nigha said I'm Ali ,PAC and Jackson all 3 in one
This was very creative
Best music video for the year🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Shit 🗑
That was a lot to unpack there
Oh this is that😮😮❤❤
I love YB but this guy is crazy 😁😁😁 he’s always been so creative I just hope this doesn’t lead to no violence ✌️  Also he talks about murder a lot in the song so idk what people are saying 🤷‍♂️
Childish Gambino vibes
NLE is so Creative and Expressive...from his movies to art to energy and elevation
NLE Done sold out 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
this why jonathan majors told him to go read the bible again
The most gangsta ass fruity shit ever done....  What a Gaysta you !! DaFuck??!!😂😂😂
I really like this actually, catchy song. I never liked the old Tupac one, but I've also never listened to youngboy
Y u waited so long
I can’t believe how throughly entertained I was from beginning to end….wow 😂😭
I respect it thug pop it for em stand tall!!! Say his name even louder if you want beef stay strapped 5 💚
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Please  grow you're hair back!!!!
May Everyone D*e in peace😂
Is that supposed to be nba youngboy on the floor with that crack pipe...😂😂😂 Damn son rap beef got too accurate
He reminds me of Tupac
MASA
Almost 4mil in 4 days😮
We always need somebody to be the bad guy, you either see him for right or don’t.! Let history repeat itself self until you wake up
🗑️
YB GOT NOTHING FOR THIS❤❤❤
I kind of like it
What is going right now?
The YNs calling YB MJ but he can’t even make nothing creative like this
Asss
Why does this remind me of weird Al videos. I kinda like it ain’t gonna lie 😂
Ts comedy😂🔥
This brother can DANCE
Heard buddens take on this and here to say this brings legit Tupac on bars/energy and anyone pretending otherwise has dementia or is protecting soemone
Auntie must be getting old because when did they start beefing?
❤❤❤❤
That is not funny ain’t shit. Cute about this video and NLE don’t want no beef with YB so he better shut up.
This like  luscious’ sons from empire all rolled into one
Revolutionary I like it he’s evolving for real glad you found yourself
Chop did his thang on this 🔥 need award for video ALONE
Nah NLE this shit is fa 🔥 🔥 ignore the haters!
What the hell is this song about?
Ok k.o🎉
I blame Kendrick Lamar for this ish😂
Hold up this might be me, but does anyone else sorta hear the beat to "Hit 'Em Up" by 2pac? Rhythmically I keep picking it up and sometimes the flow begins to match. NLE really is on another level Edit: Played the 2 back to back, yeah, that bassline was most definitely inspired by or taken from Hit 'Em Up.
That shit was fire bro !!!❤❤❤❤
bro was wearing deathrow pendant
Phenomenal 🔥🔥🔥
🙄😭😂🤣 if nba yb crying lil boy don’t respond back to this song just shows how weak he is hahaha even tho NLE choppa way better than yb
That was the shortest 4:19 seconds I’ve witnessed in a while. 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This song just might get you hurt. Hopefully not, speaking facts in this song
W
This shit hard. Period.
Heavy felt funny I was stepping backwards when he said bag the fuck up 😂😂😂
This shit is ass
I know young boy cannot come up with this creativity let’s be real
Choppa a PAC fan 💯💯
This beat reminds me of the best diss track in history (hit…….)
I like it!!
This shit weak and yb about to kill you sorry
Why is it 2hours long😢😢 still can't get enough
I’m a king Von fan not nbayongboy and nle king vons homie so I. On nle team
but this is this for Tank to Walk out to right.....like....
Lmfao he waited until nba was free and clear of excuses. He ain't lieing tho nba is just a druggie making the kids think this is cool.
Wtf is everyone saying this was creative when everything is jacked from others even down to the beat and clothes!he created nothing but a problem for his self as if his career wasn't already bad! nothing about this was original or creative! creative would definitely have something to do with that word original 😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is ass yb on top
Yuhhhhh talk yo shi NLE
Smh
Cooked!!😭
This is some of the worst rapping I ever heard
Naw he won
Proud of him. Blk ppl wake up.
Different yes but tbh this prolly one of the worst disses I’ve heard js this not it
Young brother did his thing on this one
This is creative.  🔥
this is terrible - YIKES `
This might be the weirdest thing I’ve seen my entire adult life.
New Tupac?
🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪 Mkenya
Hell yeah..! This was dope as fck..! Great video brotha..🤘

Fyaaaah
Intentions were pure, but this mc hammer ahh flow ain’t it
SA 🇿🇦
Old heads here.. he has always been entertaining youngster
It all sounds gangsta in tough right now until YB fire 🔫 back!given his track record we all know he's definitely responding and u definitely in a no win situation😂😂
This better han YB's whole discography 🔥🔥
“Looking at the devil like this is ya king” sheesh choppa been holding this back for a minute
This song is insane
Never saw 6.4 million hype points on a video until NOW, Bryson Potts
RAEJ did it better top better
how every body missing the king von flow when he pulled that ciggggggg out nba mouth thats my favorite part 2;16
Glad I was here to witness this 😬
I do know the culottes women's pants and choreography dont scream gangsta to me. Im getting a Tyler Perry vide with all the greasy 🥷. This a Lil suspect.....
Have you heard these lyrics?  I would say....listen again.
He’s breathing Yahweh, this man is planting seeds on this asleep generation 💯 this is ART, this is WISDOM!!!
Feel like he was inspired from DAX on this track
Wtf agreed to this bullshit
Gay. I mean ever since Diddy went down we all know. And the song is trrrible.
brazillll
It’s like the new version of MC Hammer
Fuck what yall talm bout if you from Louisiana you know he gone die soon we just waiting 👌🏾🩸
Masonic floor only the real know wassup
😂on repeat pure creativity ❤
Shit was hard
i miss the old nle choppa bro
Can’t be mad choppa
NLE knew exactly what he was doing with this song…3.8m in 4 days👀
🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦 We are behind CHOPPA in these good times 😤😡😠
I think this young brother on drugs
A dis song dats 4 minutes wit choreography dancn and just random shit is probably the worst shit eva!! I wouldnt bump this shit if it was da last song on the planet!’n
He wanna be tupac so bad! He not even close to it 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
#YBBetter💚4kt
KSI on the beat😭
I can not understand a word he said but I enjoyed this
for starters chop has two songs out called free young boy🙄 this was back when YB was booked on gun and drug charges. Then all chop makes is drill songs where he uses lyrics like "I don't repent for nun of my sins I know that I'll do it again" 🙄 then he chose to use Tupac as his source of inspiration all the while boasting about how bad it is to be a "Thug" didn't Tupac have a Thug life tattoo plastered against his stomach? Tupac would've never said anything about anyone else being a thug because Tupac told us he was thug. And then why did he chose to recreate the Hit em up video?
Thoughts 1-10
Trash 4kt 4life
🔥🔥🔥
Tupac is turning over in his grave..wtf is this goofy shitttttt 😅😅😅
the purple light shining over the checkerboard. thats a diss towards Masonry & the black Boule
We got NLE CHOPPA dissing NBA young boy before gta 6!💀💀💀
This is absolutely 🔥
TS SO ASS
This message and symbolism is very deep . Best way to diss YoungBoy  honestly. He can’t just respond with some surface level street shit . He has to respond with the same passion, creativity and lyrical skill that NLE did .
Sold his soul . This shi is embarrassing and cringe af to watch
Pac influenced 🔥
This ain’t it
❤
I was fucking wit you on yo woke shit you tripping now bra just get yo money and stay out da way bra.
This is fire 🔥
This shit overall trash 🗑️

# 2 Hyped
THAT ART THAT PEOPLE DIE FOR, THIS IS SO TUFF😭😭

LMAO 🤣 @ 2:59

It’s half “I live by the code” and half “this code is killing us.
TS IS TRASH
How tha fuck 1 devil spawn attack another devil spawn. These devil's spawning outta control. This is biblical, and naturally funny as fuk! Ha!
TS ID TRASH

TS IS TRASH YB IS BETTER THAN YOU GANG YOU TRYING TO BE THE NEW BEST RAPPER OR SUM
He most definitely sold his soul boy what the hell are you doing ???

Sick

Bro had a  revolver😂0:29
He really think he tupac
3pac wsg
So this goofy waited until YB was on tour and don't have time to respond to release a diss song 🤔
They couldn’t chain us openly anymore, so they built systems that made us chain each other the oppressor is still in power🤦‍♀️ we kill eachother for them
Its a mix MJ and 2pac
[Intro: 50 Cent] Yeah nigga! Haha Let's go nigga, this is what it is 2Pac cut his head bald Then you wanna cut yo' head bald (You pussy nigga!) 2Pac wear a bandanna You wan' wear a bandanna (What do we have here now?) 2Pac put a cross on his back You wanna put crosses on yo' back Nigga you ain't 2Pac This 2Pac!
We hear you, we hear Kendrick…it’s time to take our culture and creativity back. ❤
Ds so bunz 🫤

Creativity pro max, did is a hella niceeeeeee video, and the song 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Young boy so bad for our youth the kids are the future and ya letting them take it away from them it’s that deep.
Ok ig just start mj move
Grown ass man btw 😂
Illumanati  signs all over this video
The industry plant his soft ass they all hating let dat man yb be great and let God be the judge of his character
Why did you sit there this why B bro he did nothing to you, bro. I’m not even that bro. You better hope he don’t respond but if he responds, bro, yo yo careers killed gang.💯
Giving me Not Like Us Vibes
Is he gay? The song is aight but this might be the gayest video I’ve seen. I don’t understand what he’s trying to do
Catchy as hell … 😂😂
Lol. Somebody hella wants yb to go away forever.
🔥🔥
Tbh I’m not a fan boy but dis is garbage . I use to couldn’t listen to YB songs but lately I can vibe to some Shyt. Especially trap 101
NBA great 4kt
This shit ass fr.
😂😂
clean up on aisle 4k ninja
Ko 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
YEOOOO WHAT YALL THINKS BOUT MY MUSIC
This shit hit hard fuq you mean 😂😂😂😂❤
Damn dey got choppa. Turned him out. Sad to see.
I mean just wow. Not what i was expecting. This is an actual work of art.
This the same dude that was sayin free yb
Definitely he was watching mj and Pac hit🔥🔥🔥
Best 4 minutes I've spent this month
TS ASS
Looks like the super star kid is becoming a better man
Hell yeah I’ve been waiting for something like this FUCk yb
Calling out the bondage yb is keeping the youth in is needed. Set the music free we used to have so many different versions of rap and hip hop. All this shit is violent and hypersexual.
I came looking to see if the video i saw was fake and this even worse is he SERIOUS?
Finna get yo ass gunned down tryna be like pac goofy🤣🤣
This the sassiest diss song video I've ever seen. How you dissing, prancing, dancing and sticking your tongue out?
He must don’t know what happened to the last artist that dissed yb
I hate rap I don’t listen to it but this song surprised me. First rap I am willing listening to in years. Congrats I am hooked.🤭👏
This is a beautiful piece of work, Mr. Potts.  Thank you.  Blessings.
tupac 2.0 ngl he snapped, this mf brought back the 90s frl, stole my idea lol but ngl u snapped bro
Great song. Awesome visuals. Just a lil sus 🤨
I don’t really know a ton about the beef surrounding this, but I love this beat. Real 90s shit
🔥👽🔥
this song deserves to go straight to a deleted file in the trash 🗑️🚮.  // CRINGE.
I fw the song I like yo rap but I like yb more no disrespect
Love this shit, I hate young boy, I have never heard one good youngboy song ever, I'm from Chicago and even before the king von and Lil Durk beef, I could tell young boy was a poser, a lame, and whole bitch at the same time...NLE smoked him on this, and NLE is Artistic, he definitely shows who influenced his life and Tupac , Tyson, and Michael Jackson are three of the greatest of all times.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Feel like the diss was random asf 😂
Lol Tupac flow and everything (Hit em Up)
🍑Cheeks Button 🫩
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Say what you want he did the equivalent of Apollo creed living in America entrance. Not only did he flame him but he did it in a never before seen dancing video
🔥🔥🔥
Wait .. this song hard asl. when I first seen clips I just thought NLE was being bold to diss YB ( after boldly repping him) , but the music video is great too ❤.
🔥🔥🔥🔥😂😂😂
🔥🔥
This is horrible gng disses yb gonna get prob killed and he looks goofy  who agrees   👇
Boy, this shit whack.😢
Nice video 😂
NLE just got a new fan. Didn’t even know he could spit. TBH I put him in the same box as YB! Wtf!
This the most zesty diss video I’ve ever seen
I know nle was smoking dat yb pack listening to this song once it dropped 😂
😂 jokey joke
The video is very creative didn't love the song but it was cool..
Shit hard but mind you, nigga made a movie dedicated to youngboy, reaching hard af
SOOO CREATIVE!!
Nle  Choppa is Carzy Crazy for this one !!!  Definitely stepping  on business,  if you gone do a diss go all out on , I respect  it !!!
RIP DA REAL GEE MONEY
This 🥷 funny as hell 😂😂😂😂
He lowkey hit yB dance 😂
Come on y'all let get this to 4m 🔒 fast hurry 🔁 repeat repeat repeat loop we got this y'all come on stay strong w fans W NLE W song let him spread the wrd 🔥 we got this push stronger
This is dope 👌 nice choreography nice song 💯💯
Rap was never about lyrics it was about creativity. This is why I like this song giving tribute to the original song and sample while also giving PAC his flowers 🌺 is what music is missing.
Hmm..
Finish him😂
I’m not gonna lie, this song hard and entertaining as hell 😂. NLE is that great 🔥
💩
I thought this was about spreading positivity I’m confused but tearing another man down
Tupac would be disappointed
Not rap at all
Damn trash vs trash lmaoo😅😅😅
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤❤all of this is 🔥🔥🔥
YB CANT EVEN LIE AS A ARTIST THIS IS ART
This is creative.. I’ll admit ! I’m a huge YB fan !! When you come up missing……. 🤷‍♀️💚🐍 you clearly chasin clout ! YB on tour & this what you doin ? 🤣🤣 YB been responded years ago & you just now sayin somethin ? 🤣🤣🤣 RJAE (YB artist) has responded ! You’re NEXT TO GO, BUDDY ! I’d knock you off if you was running wit my head & prepared a burial in a video ! Hope you eating enough Seamoss to save you 🤣🤣🤣👎
Raps ain’t bad, but I still stand by no dance moves in diss track. I get he’s an entertainer and it’s part of the show. But takes away impact from the bars. And the most detrimental thing yb is doing is his trump swallowing and u didn’t even mention it. Thats where u should’ve had your focus instead of things ppl can say u do too
Crazy how he telling him bout his self but did the same thing 😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Grow your hair back and then get waves
What y’all think about this
I pray for this man safety good luck 👍🏾
This was a fire 🔥 ass video!
how dare you diss yb yb is better then you nle
This is an award worthy video. Fun! Creative. Has substance.
Trinidad 🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹 this is fire
That’s yb you messing with
I ain’t know he could dance😂😂😂
So am I the only one realizing he paying homage to people that went against the grain? This why I love this YN. I swear 😂
⁠yall are hypocrites just like nle,he made a diss song with yb head cut off and also all he talk about is killing people,guns drug and he wanna say yb is poising the youth, if you go say that about yb you should point the finger at lil durk and king Von too but we know he won’t do that..the youth been poisoned😂
“Don’t fear evil because evil should fear you if Jesus Christ is within you” Amen🙏🏽
K.O
They got em
Suppose to be YB #1 fan btw. without Yb yo ass wouldn't even be rapping you should take time and think before you act.
Bro channelled pac and Michael. I see the vision.
You should be  b canceled
❤
Yo  what made yu diss young boy
This shit is god awful 😂😂😂😂
When YB catches you, you and your non-existent story were.
Who came from TikTok cuz it was all over ur fyp😭
Congrats to this kid, he literally just made the best diss song in a long time. This one is gonna go crazy, NBA just got what us 40 year olds call ethered. You can ask Jay z about that.
🔥
love this young man keep up the good work
Ts buns
This was dope. Im 40 and Ive seen a bunch of different phases in hip hop and rap. I liked the creativity,  I can't understand anything he is saying, but he gets an A+ for visuals, the choreography,  and the beat.
This shit gay AF
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I like boys hmu
sounds like "get out the way yo, get out the way yo, biggie smalls just got popped" from hit em up
Damn that’s a sexy black man 🥰
He mixed pac with Michael Jackson lmao
What in the ybn namir 😂😂
@NLEtheGreat shit trash homie , then you got the checkerboard all through the video soul gone , dancing negus Pac would never, got Africa painted red...you apart of the red dragon or some...yo symbolism show it you ain't no better than NBA homie
Weird as fuck video. Dope song. But damn
Rumble young man, Rumble! I want to see you accomplish everything your soul desires
I kinda get it this about GOD and the devil...    amen all power be to GOD amen
This song ass. Beat ass. Dance moves ass. The greatest piece of dookie.
Video of the year 🔥🔥🔥🔥
U cooked
In the middle of watching this video it keeps cutting off that mean NBA young boy ppl trying to delete this video we know what it is is it will not let me comment lol
Bring back old nle pls
Lame
Ooooooooooooo weeee😮😮😮😮😮😮 yb have a minute to respond oooooooooo lord choppa went crazxyyyyyyyy
Garbage
👏🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾 love it
This shit hard and it had to be said not gonna lie but coming for young boy rip you bro 😢
Man you are not Michael Jackson
Corny. I don’t like YB either. But like I get it… it’s just whack. And I watched the whole Den of Kings sit down where he couldn’t shut up. Going on about God as if he was the preacher sent to preach to his elders. Couldn’t read a room. But mind you this is the “Top Shotta” “Slit Me Out” “If I was a bad bitch” like lil bro just doing shit
RIP
I can’t wait to yb drop 4kt  for life 💚💚💚💚💚💚
NLE finally Showing his self, Ngl The newer music is better “RESPECTFULLY AND IN MY OPINION”
Bro the video hard fuck what he said
Knocked Off
People have to know there’s power in both in Good & Evil. It ain’t going nowhere, ever. James 1 :12-18
You call this a diss song? 😂😂
Listen Word play is good riding the beat and flow and presentation. Probably a two out of 10 you could’ve picked a totally better be to hit him with.
hot garbage
Wtf....this the gayest shit i ever seen 💯
This nigga been a fan saying youngboy leading the youth wrong but what was von doing
MB auto type ick

Salute
Sampling good ole Dennis Edwards’ Don’t Look Any Further…🎉  this is a nice song!
YB done
😂😂😂😂
Tupac vibes seriously tho 😮
Nle’s style is fucking amazing I love how humorous he is and going on this classic shit is a jam
God forgive my people for not knowing right and wrong and missing my nigga message fr
This joint is trash man.. before y'all talk about "lyrics", if we went from Nas, Jay, Doom, Andre, Scarface, etc, to this and y'all impressed. I'm scared for the future of music.
Maluco conseguiu misturar 2Pac e M. Jackson no mesmo clipe encima de uma diss Track, absurdo de bom 🔥🔥🔥
How is no one realising he is gay
Well at least the song banging I see yo elevation but yalll don't turn this into some Drake and Kendrick type shit cuz all that  was way overrated

Fire
Boo ko boo
Why is this starting to grow on me 🤔
Bro made a whole song about young boy😂 he in love 😂😂
This shi trash 😂😂
I’m failing to see the “cr@ck pipe” that everyone is mad about on TikTok ? It’s a j or cig obviously ? Unless im missing a different scene im confused about that where did that come from😂
Boo
Nle Choppa knows what he's doing - creative diss, but going at YB brings more heat than respect. He should aimed that energy at something worth real conversation or spark real conversation. He enjoying the chaos and using it to stay relevant, swinging between lone wolf wanna be 2pac energy and street vibes. Talent and awareness are there, but hype is wining over legacy - messy, risky, and exactly  why can't stop talking about him.
Yes the old not is back
This shit so trash 🗑️
This shit was ass, yb dropping heat soon
This is gay AF.
Definitely creative🔥🔥🔥
He killed this ninja with flawless choreography.....  I'm stretching my head, because it's the first time i seen anything like this, and vibing at the same time.... this ish Crazy!!!.... no one in rap history has ever set it off this way 😂
Without a doubt, it's the best.
Beef or No beef.This song is fire.
He mad he ain’t the nbayoungboy right now.
This hard tho🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥
This is not tuff 😂😂😂
I know who really did it 🤫😅🔥
I love this the music was great the creativity was amazing to. Something the game has lost site of. Didn't think I'll rock to.the.new. generation but I will give it to him on this one and love the message in this video
I hate itb
i thought he was trying to be holy n now he dissing someone that will leave him in the dust
NLE smoking that young boy pack tonight 💨
Shit weird AF to me sometimes can't understand what he even saying
That's way too many subliminals,  not a good look. Look at history. Every artist (now claimed deceased) he dressed like had issues with Jay Z and/or Sony, he rocnation, but not signed to rocnation. There are 5 writers on this track published under Sony. Then they SAY slaves house/field niggas (ancestors). Calling out someone for doing the same thing that person is doing or has done is crazy. Music deals also lead to rivalries in which we have seen people end up slain from those behind the scene. Who cash in after they die? Labels if the artist is not careful in their dealings. Be careful who you make deals with. Creating enemies for show is never good regardless of who is doing it. Get money the SAFE AND LEGITIMATE WAY.  I can't say even legal because what the hell is that anyway? Those frueds tend to come back to visit especially in spirit right when everybody least expect it.
Mann .40 was crazy dats his right foot creep 😂😂😂 bro I fw YB but dis 1here wild 🔥 an Raw
I’m impatiently waiting on YB response!!
I know kentrell ctfu! Watching this shit cuz it was overly whack!

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
He really do love the art- this is real hip hop.
I'm a New Fan ❤Thanks
Notice the checker board floor!
Ko❤
Does anyone else have a hard time understanding this ?
An irrelevant used to be one hit wonder, who saw how much hype and money yb been getting all summer by just touring. Nle can’t even sell out a stadium in his own home town. And I’m from Memphis area and used to rock with NLE. This right here was the most ultimate player hating, opportunistic, clout chasing, dying to stay relevant, leaching, contradicting rap song in hip hop history. They don’t even have beef. They got into an online argument like 2-3 years ago over nothing for like 2 posts lol. Yb been rising and climbing since he came out as an actual child in like 2015-2016. NLE was hot in and around Memphis. But never got the nation wide fans like yb did. Just straight up hating
I think we can all agree no African will ever pick YB over NLE
this shit hard
Creative Direction on 1000 - give his new team a mf raise! 🔥🔥🔥
This clean but bro is not Muhammad Ali, Ali should not be reenacted by a rapper. Ali is a legend, may his name be great
ጃኒን ለማየት ነዉ የመጣሁት ብቻየን ነኝ መሰለል 😊😊😊❤
U got a free young boi song
That nigga said it flat out rip 2pac /nle dad
Ko
Nle the goat 🐐 🙌 😎 👌 💯 💪
Why is NLE trying to be pac so bad just be yourself bro you were already that at one point when he was a vegan or some shit 😂
Man shit weak
we have to respect the square footwork too
COOKED THAT FRAUD!!  KEEP GOING DAWG 💪💪💪💪💪💪
One mite die to violence
It’s a good conversation about culture and music and how the two were once intertwined and artists would dance and were larger than life to how now it’s just about murder and it’s poisoning the culture and the youth and he blames it on NBA youngboy, who he already had a beef with as the conversation piece.
Nggas got all this energy for yb but durk drop the same typa shit and ion see nobody giving bruh hell
That shit is ass cause he had no business dissing NBA Yung boy cause young boy did not do nothing or diss him that stupid
Lamest diss track of all time. Least creative and most attention seeking song ever made. He ain’t even got beef with yb
Know you doing anything that come to mind
YB BETTER...MASA...#YOUCANTFWYB
The only thing I liked and respect about this is that it’s not just a 2 minute song like all songs now a days he actually put in some work into this good job
He took this one TOP
yb betta
Weak as hell
I fux w this
No 🧢 NLE made sure he was heard
Anybody saying this dis bacc fired really don't know music, it's a hit, actually listen to lyrics he ain't lying
That shit wack😂
I pray the beautiful youngsters leave the streets behind and not be used by the Devil
Ts assssssssssssssss
Pac would be proud
This hits
He goin up . Cut it out. UNITY

Very creative.
Sorry but Yb finna put Nle in pieces after this one
Not going to lie. This is what the culture needs. Lyrics on this one bang hard and with a purpose.  Most of the popular songs out nowadays dont deserve to be heard by the masses. Im elated to witness this spiritual cleansing that the culture desperately needs. #KO
This Video actually 🔥🔥🔥
Bruh this is all Masonic 33 degree ish checkered board floor should always be the first hint to you guys this shit scripted bro
I can kill anyone.Tell meThis video is crazy pain.Respect to the legends at the same time.Why he kills goofy std boy
This is some of the dopest visuals and choreography I’ve seen in recent memory.
Gas ⛽️ ⛽️ ⛽️ ⛽️ ⛽️ ⛽️ kill std boY
😂😂😂😂
Actually this is actually really good
😂😂could’ve got this message out without all the dancing choreography
I’m behind him he 901. Fuck errrybody else.
Yo this is trash gang I am a fan but this is not good
Kendrick Lamar wannabe like if you agreee
Telling the truth... 🤷‍♂️
man downnnn
I’m going to start by saying I wish both of them growth, peace, and success in life.   Now, this is truly a work of art. From the visuals to the lyrics. If you don’t get the words then you’re not trying to. I absolutely love several things about this song, but let’s jump to certain parts. “ Everybody that you rep on I know who really did it” allegedly NBA Youngboy does a lot of antagonizing in his songs and performances about men who have been murdered like Von, G Money, etc. all ppl who he allegedly according to the streets did not unalive but mocks them as if he did. For example acting as if he is laying on a pillow during his performance because the G Money person was on a pillow when they were trying to save him when he bled out. If he did not do certain acts, that is also misleading to the fans who look up to him making it seem like he’s this person he is not. They suck it up and want to be that when he’s not even that. The references of him being demonic are from a clip of Youngboy speaking saying the industry is demonic and that he himself was demonic (his own words, I saw the interview) “ The beating females thinking it’s cute, allegedly youngboy is abusive. There was a video of one of his kid’s mothers alleging what happened to her with their child present. She was bloody and bruised in the live explaining. There may have been other incidents. DV is a huge issue in our community and it’s being normalized by toxic culture. As a DV survivor and a woman who has dealt with the toxic mentality, I appreciate the line. Throughout the years NLE has stated he liked Youngboy’s music and is a fan and when some of his friends said NBA wasn’t who he raps to be on a live he tried to stop them and he kept saying he himself was a fan to make amends. Throughout the years continuous jabs have been made in the music from one to the other and their affiliates have even had an altercation. As they both grow older and embark on their journeys they’re both supposed to be evolving. NLE says he embraces his light and his dark meaning he knows what he’s done, who he is, his bad in him, and he’s choosing to try to embrace and spread his light as he grows. “Why he ain’t doing his part? Why he ain’t doing his part? “ He’s basically saying that NBA is not growing in the light and continues to focus on the dark because he’s a demon and a puppet of the industry used to poison the minds of our babies  (programming) the board in the scenes I see multiple way but we’ll focus on the NBA being a part of the devil’s game. However, NLE is also saying he’s playing chess him self. And he intends to slay the demon he’s been put up against. The violent language is just a more urban way of saying what he will do to the demon. It’s not even that he hates the man he hates what he feels is controlling him. Hence we can bang it out ( House vs Field) Industry/ Controlled  to oppress the other people of color. He keeps referencing all the greats because he feels he is the great and is in his prime right now. He’s show casing the art, the creativity, and his willingness to understand and respect our culture in the visuals. If I missed something, please other art lovers tell me what you saw.   This is art. If anything at all. This is a well executed production and it’s been on repeat. I hate when beef happens but dammit I love the works produced! I love a creative mind. Let’s Go. 🎉
Honestly I respect NLE's reasons for dissing YB more than Kdot dissing Drake
This more creative than anything YB has done.
Love it ❤
This shit is trash
If Kendrick had the beef with Drake during TPAB era
He snapped on YB 😂😂😂😂😂 Man!.....Down!!

🤷🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
We can’t be deadauzz in the big 25
Nle was probably influenced by 2pac
Gotta respect the effort put in to this.. The hook goes crrraaazy🔥🔥
ANOTHER PUPPET WHO SOLD THEIR SOUL!! ... DOWN GOES ANOTHER ONE!!!
Bro did this instrumental JUSTICE. Insane!
The gay vibes are strong in you my child.
The only criticism I have with this is that everybody tends to blame YB but give people like Durk and Von a pass. Overall, plenty rappers send bad messages but blaming them for the problem isn’t the way to go about it. Not everyone who listens to drill music tries to be about that life.
this so fire 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☄️☄️☄️☄️
NLE THE Great against all ODDs part 2
NLE GONE Forever ThUG ✝️💜
Best diss track of the 2025 🎉

He in a weird phase but once he get pasty his zesty era he might be problem. This production crazy and rapping is not bad the bars just mid.
This would’ve been a better track without the silly choreography.. although it’s creative it takes away from the lyrics and message.. should’ve dropped the audio only then waited to drop the video
Nba ❤ money and power ...  Nel gay baby mexico ...

I don't listen to nba . But I understand he's a pretty good artist..im genuinely excited to see if nba makes a song back , ND how it'll sound..cause this diss song is Gonna definitely be legendary.  I wonder if yb makes a song back actually rapping , a song about street ish . Or he just takes it to the street... this beef only interesting cause nle was the biggest yb fan. And he never hid it . Sounds like he's disappointed lol. I genuinely don't see yb coming out with something as creative as the song idea ND the video.  But we'll see ! I'd be Genuinely Impressed.
Lets get this trending number 1 🎉 repeat repeat repeat we got this 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔁🔁🔁
They did attend english class
How you gone diss young boy when you doing the same shit if anything build your brother up instead of tearing him down you know that ain't right we posed to be making America great again y'all make shit worse for everybody.
Uganda 🇺🇬
Gibberish trash 🗑️
All I hear is bullshit
Trash.
Twin flames tryna bring a demon pain ????? Explain this line
Shout out to  @jahnny
Hand signs, demonic imagery, checkerboard floors, political agendas, and more all stuffed into a 4 minute music video for an artist who seemingly just transformed overnight. This is some sketchy/sold your soul type shit right here. Stay vigilant and don’t fall asleep in the grass. The snakes will find you.
Like the creativity
This been stuck in my head since it come out
The Red jacket, the diss to YB, the white and Black Checkered floor; yeah, something ain't right here. NLE Choppa either just sold his soul fr, or will be another rapper that is sacrificed.
Twerking during a diss track is utterly insane wtf is up wit this generation
This shot so lame n bs 😂😂😂
Listen I’m all for the positivity but the dances and outfits are crazy 😂😂😂😂
bro this song is SO good i stg im bumping ts over and over
This is fire 🔥 🔥😤
God gonna watch over him ❤ youngboy we gonna help you no hell but Evolution 🎉

This is masterpiece really waiting for this type of creativity from him ❤️❤️he really choped young boy🤣
FOR VON!
He better not reply 😂
This is the worst diss in hip hop history...
Awesome
Well, damn, it’s amazing. What Ai did with NLE Choppa and his new video it wrote a diss two NBA YoungBoy, that actually directed and gave the videography notes for the treatment. It’s amazing how this AI stuff is cheating the fans all the artists are using it now including NBA YoungBoy this shit is water down. Can’t trust nothing in the industry no more this is not true. Artistry don’t be fooled 😮😮😮😮🤺🤺🤺🤺🤺📡📡📡
I thank you nle for potentially bringing old yb back you clout chaser😂
Imagine dissing yo father😂😂
This is a masterpiece 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
K.O ! K.O !!!
My name is ko
You will never be YB‼️🐍
2:28 who that 😅
WHEN THE CLASS NERD DECIDES TO STAND UP FOR HIMSELF:
WHOEVER SAYS THIS IS TRASH & THAT YB SHOULDNT RESPOND PLEASE HOP OFF YB DICK HE DONT KNOW YOU LMAOOOOO JUST ENJOY THE MUSIC
So many feels. Thank you brother! this is great in so many ways. Talk to the people that need to hear this!!!
🔥🔥🔥 drake could NEVER!!
Everything about this is industry
Trash
And for the record the rock nation line is a metaphor for he still sell out shows he still him on tour as well man damn open ya ears
This boy finna die.
ts tuff
WE GETTING A GRAMMY WITH THIS ONE
I don't like yb but this song wack
honestly disappointed in NLE. This diss track feels like pure clout chasing, especially now that YB is out of jail and is on tour—he’s clearly at the top of the game right now. What makes it worse is the irony: NLE used to make music heavily inspired by YB’s style and was even a fan of his. Now he’s turning around and criticizing him, calling YB a negative influence on the youth. The whole thing just feels contradictory, if not outright hypocritical. And just to be clear, this isn’t about taking sides—I actually listen to both artists and respect their music.
No
HALLELUJAH
Hopefully yb don’t even respond to this goofy ass 🥷
Yaweh bumaye ?
He look like light skin monte @lightskinmonte 😂😂
Buns he copied Tupac and he’s basically a influencer now nle not tuff no more
The real reason he mad tho: NLE felt the need to speak out and say he’s choosing Durk side over YB… yada yada yada… cool.. that’s when YB made “know like I know”….  Somewhere along the lines, NLE wanted to make mends and jump ships for the 2nd time.  Since Durk ended up in prison, he wana be a YB fan again… But YB was like nahhh— stay over there…  So now he mad and wana use YB for clout to help push this fake ass Healy guru rebranding since his own mother went live calling him out for faking like he a tough guy and faking like he from the hood n etc. His fake-ness was eating at her… so boom he revamped as a clownery version of a health guru.
NLE THE GREAT
This shi trashhhhhh
😆😆🇭🇹🎙️💪💪🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🚮
This is very cringy to watch weirdo YB STILL BETTER
Hit hem Up Vibes, bald like pac too 🔥😂
With a message this powerful can rattle up some heavy hitters but he came correct he didn’t expect God to back him on no BS so he chose this and when you backed by God you fear none!! I call this perfect timing🤞🏽middle of yb tour Choppa hit number one the irony in this🫣 yall want Art well there you go! Can’t tell me this wasn’t creative on all levels with strategy that wasn’t negative but still on his level of communication lol but truth all truth look at the greatest in the video u don’t have to be promoted in bad light to be great the boldness on high, its all facts and truth and they still mad but that boldness is Godly he rather risk his life for the message tell me that ain’t God it’s is familiar to me I know cuz I was blessed with the same boldness when I gained a relationship with The Most High and maintained it He gives u plenty of boldness,protection and awareness of who in charge nobody amongst us are in charge🤣🤣sooo not even yall best rapper we don’t fear nobody but God literally and he tried to piece it up like he said and didn’t go nowhere choppa grew up and now this is the results after adding God in your life sooo I’m with it take the demon down while he at his peak that’s priceless cancel him yb rap and make violence and anger towards other people sound appealing and that’s Art to yall well him and yall need help.Cheering and dick riding his toxicity but won’t get help is insane his music keep yall in bondage lost and without even knowing mindset on being green, slime, ain’t shit, on demon time like for what? Nothing positive in Florida green is a term for shiesty cut throat in loyal backstabbing slimy snake 🐍 that can’t be trusted ok nothing more to say
It’s not a bad song, it’s a dope idea actually… but the dancing throws it completely off 😭😭😭
za za za

Man, estava na hora de novidade trazendo o old atemporal para este universo cansativo da música e do visual! Está perfeito!

Yo Soon, there is going to be the rapture. It's when there will be trumpet sounds, and after the trumpet sounds, God will lift his people from here. Also, God said people should be living by the Bible. Amen, and God bless you. ❤Jesus loves you guys. Dont wait, please. He will welcome you with arms wide open.❤ ❤* John 3:16 - "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have eternal life". ❤

This is ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhssssssssssssss
🔥
W NLE Chappa🔥🔥 King von will be happy to hear this song RIP king von the🐐❤
People aren't listening to the lyrics that's why they are mocking the song your in denial that your favorite artist is poisoning and confusing the youth and your one of those people you don't want to admit it even though it's true He is DAMAGING this generation & including NLE, wearing boots and hip thrusting on stage and stuff saying if he was a girl he would want to have a relationship with the same gender / himself. youngboy and NLE both got issues tbh NBA Youngboy doing hip dances wearing girly tight skinny jeans on stage and making appearances in caskets with green oak looking trees in the background making his tours look demonic Hope they squash it if he responds and it gets worse
Yoooo this slaps 👊🏾💯 plant that seed in they head my boi 👍🏾👍🏾
I really could care less what he's saying.This video is fire
This 🥷🏾 might be the gayest straight 🥷🏾 I ever seen
Reppin South africa

But ion know where all this coming from..... you dropping Halloween movies and that car wash movie doing numbers doing good, don't worry what another nigga doin.... Focus on your career not nobody else's unless u got it like that! But my bwoii cut his hair and became a light Brite Tupac shakur lol..... I love the creativity but u jogging with the man's head was shocking and insane to me
This was different
😂😂😂
It took u 3 years to? You wannabe yb ? I mean he was yo favorite rapper so
What happened to this goofy😭😂
OTF Represented
Yb better
The only thing I didn’t understand at 2:26 you can see a person in black «shooting» NLE, wtf is that about? Hope his good and nothing happens to him tho
Thats lock me in a room with him to far but i kinda do think nle could  rape yb if he wanted to hand to hand

THE END KO☠️🍷🔫
I cannot not.... smfh...Love your music but why focus on NBA. Resorting to violent language but saying he is trash is distasteful. Now when some dumb shit starts up remember how it started. You were better when you played with the shake you used to do. Idk wtf this bs is. Whoever is influencing this bs on you should be F I R E D. Maybe it's the baldness
Nigga went for Pac to Michael Jackson 😂
He got my favorite rapper beat on hereeee❤
Idk
Dammmm 💪💪💪

NLE King❤
He lowkey gassed this bitch outta nowhere 😅....mmkay
deleting hate comments is crazy
Smh
Yow bro diddy
The clips wasn’t doing this video justice, shit is valid!
This is a lyrical masterpiece and spanking at the same time
I’m liking this Groovy style
Criticizing a guy for beating women....while using the word 'BITCH' when talking about those women....is insane work.
Finally, someone in this new era to make some noise. Bars, beat, dance, story line and the diss itself. FIREEEE I fux w it
😂 no wait 🤣🤣🔥
That mf killed that shit doe no lie
This dancing clown such a goof
KNOCK-OUT
🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬 am from Uganda
Nle the goat video is very creative and the lyrics is very catching NBA wish he could make something like this and y'all NBA fans are sleeping listening to a nigga that sounds like crack head
i can tell you’re in love with the art!
Boy is about to be knocked out by Yb..😅😢 RIP NLE😢
Yo Choppa I know you prolly ain't gone see this but remember when you made that song called 23 for new years when it was turning 2023 yea man that song was fire man we need more songs like that this year for 2026 you should make one it would be fire for your music channel
why south african 🇿🇦 flag on there😭
You know this YN with the illuminati puppet ass....The video looks zesty, and the checkerboard floor at the end is illuminati
This was hard asf like a movie my eyes was glued 🔥 🔥 🔥
Never bumping this in the hood 😂
Folk think he 2pac
He is using the soundtrack hit’ 'em up by 2Pac for his diss track to dies Youngboy
He’ll nawww 😂😂😂😂
God keep NLE SAFE
Im not gone lie this went crazy but I still love me some nba young boy
Ain’t no one can say oh well u used to do this and dat promoting guns cuz he adressed that in the song but it’s called growing up and he speaking on how nba still talks about the same shi
“Embrace my light and my dark” WHY HE AINT DOING HIS PART!  (Yb only dark)😮
I’m rooting for Nle, he can literally take over the rap game if he keeps ts up💯💯
This song and video is interesting, I cant stop coming back to it
Yo this is the hardest Shi I seen in a minute 🔥
Imagine you wake up to this diss towards you😂😂😂😂💀💀
Hey you went off with this one I watched this video 10 times. I’m officially a new fan lol
I must say that I always thought his way of thinking was interesting although I’m not a fan of rap music & I never listened to any of his previous music. This brother is intelligent, you have to read between the lines. He’s speaking in a language that most common ppl can understand but if you listen closely & if you really know, you know what he’s saying. This is not merely a threat to YB as in literally k*lling him, it’s a message much bigger. #staywoke  Well done NLE 🔥
This is what i wanted the Not Like Us video to feel like 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Calling someone out as a Puppet while being a bigger Puppet is crazy work. Wake up people.
This sound like a kidz bop diss song
That shiii ass try better next time😂💯
NLE been goated since he dropped letter to my daughter. NBA fans are mad and they should be but tbh tour no tour busy not busy in terms of hip hop this response taking awhile and that’s not a great look 😂
Ass
Young boy somewhere punching the air in his Chanel rain boots.🤣🤣🤣
I was a little skeptical about this at first but damn I fw it frfr. Creative with the beef track. 🤣🤣🤣
Ts is hard asf 😂🔥 wtffff
This hard but youngboy bouta cook yo asss
This guy is sad because yb taking over the industry 🤣
rip nle choppa
Bruh its the first song i love from NLE af lol  I am hard to please
He sound like a hater😅
What in the fuck was that
NBA youngboy was never thinking bout dis ngga 😂😂😂 now YB abt to catch dis ngga lacking
This Was 🔥🔥🔥
Love the SA flag in the video
Yea he sold his soul they got his ass
Everyone saying that haven’t seen this much creativity in the rap game is a lie if you’re including the men $ women. As far as male rap I have to agree.
Nah gang don't associate South Africa with this music video, we don't want no smoke with YB😖 as a matter a fact we fw YB this side🤣
I hate Youngboy part 2 LOADING…..
2pac
Wait what's my country flag at the back doing there 🇿🇦
This shii trash you not fukking wit yb😂😂😂
Isn’t Kai Cenat and NLE friends?? Seems to me that choppa got his feelings hurt cuz Kai went to YBS concert and NLE wasn’t on mafiathon 3 at all?? The timing of this video coming out is what makes me think this! Also, wasn’t choppa just being talked about for starving his kid and sending them to the er or was that all false??
tough
I gotta be honest I didn’t understand not one thing cuh said lol ….. youngboy prolly won’t even react to this lol but yea it was cute tho
Ko
Ngl this hard
Nle your a good artist keep it im the booth we lost too many brothas to violence.      Yb better BTW 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I want those 4 minutes of my life back
I loved the creativity in this video ❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥
this heattt
NLE, you got a new supporter. This music video is visually stunning, nostalgic of some of the greatest moments in history, and the song is hard af. A little healthy rivalry ain’t hurt nobody and the message at its core is positive. I love how you gave credits to your team at the end. You and them did a great job. Thank you for being independent and not being afraid to take risks. Independent artist are the best 🔥🔥🔥
This shit trash 🗑
Ain’t no way u dancing like that n trying to be a thug
He diss himself 😂
The weakest song of 2025

All the media outlets is quiet all of sudden…. The breakfast club quiet asf they on diddy nut sack…. Vlad Tv 👀👀👀 he ain’t talking….. Boosie BadAzz I need your opinion big dog….

Been grinding underground for years. Just dropped a track called “Save Me.” If you’re into real emotion and pain music, give it a listen — feedback means everything. ❤️🙏
This is the most truthful diss I’ve ever seen
Tuffest song of this year man I can’t stop listening to this💯
1:15 ouuu weee !!!
I ain’t even a fan, but he ain’t tell no lie. YB ain’t no gangster… ain’t never stepped on nothing but his girlfriends. Brest fed with no daddy poisoning the youth.
It’s lit 🔥

Nle choppa na relíquia do Michael Jackson ❤❤❤❤
Maybe im just old
And yall continue to act like Eminem is not influential today .
Getting diss with a choreography is a new meta!
Next level ...checker boards...= illuminati
Cornball
This music is actually artistic .. thus a real artist .. all YB do is yell and promote violence ..   YB a goofy

Idc to conflict with anywho that vent their opinion, but I will say that I am Gen X, 2 Pac would be so proud of NLE and rock like a mf on this!!! FrFr 🔥🙌🏽💯✊🏽

Respectfully this man paid respect to the greats 🙌🏾
3mil in 3 days 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I need that instrumental
Checkerboard floor everywhere..dead giveaway
U trippin nle bald😂
I notice that when the video started it said that it was created by the Most High, after listening and watching what he was actually saying and doing, I realized he said Yahweh. This message was deep, and showed a lot within NLE and our people.. honestly all need the fire to enlighten the world instead of bringing so much darkness to it.
Dis deep NLE finna get sacrificed
Woke up this morning and my Alexa started blasting nle. He’s such an inspiration! Been listening to him for 5 years ❤ Stay blessed🙏🏽
Dont be a puppet wake up
KO
Hahaha
He’s channeling greats.
Damn bro why u hating on YB like that 🤦🏻‍♂️
This song 🔥🔥asf! For those don't agree you're the problem with hip hop rn!
10/10 music video !! ... TUPAC .. MJ.. kENDRICK ... CHILDISH GAMBINO.....Blended well !!
No one can deny that this ma is creative asf. This is real deal art-
I don't understand how this has  3 million views cause it's absolute crap
bro wanna be 2pac so bad lol but heat 🔥🔥😤😤
Used to love NLE but after this and this music video hell no YB for LIFE
Tupac hit em up by nle Choppa😂😂

I came here just to say shut up how yb poisoning the youth and you made slut me out 🤦🏾‍♂️ what u think that kid make the kids do 👎🏾‼️
Yo- I can't lie this is hard asf. I didn't wanna like this as a former YB fan but fackkkk
Okay NLE I see your game fire like that
This was well put together no cap
In all seriousness I hope all YB fans go to a mental hospital and get the help that they need💚🙏🏾
nle not onnat fr he tron make it a rap beef to run up his views if he was really onnat like he say he is he would of got in contact w sb in da NBA clique to send YB a message but he didn’t nle the real breastfed emotional bih he did all that fake spiritual shit to run up views n that didn’t work so now he goin full blown internet for reactions clicks n money he a goofy bald head flunk
🔥  🔥 🔥 🔥
Garbage
Janeeeeee
He only got views because it's about nba youngboy
I had to subscribe after this one
He snapped..rep that Memphis my guy
I totally dislike trap rap like NBA YoungBoy or even NLE but this has to be one of the most creative music videos I’ve ever seen in a long time I’m 26. It’s not much but for the last eight years or so it’s all been the same type of basic shit. This is so different.
This needs about 300 more million views😂
Mannnn y’all minus will get in the ring
This is beyond creative, people making fun but it’s creative AF!
I’m messing with it
Idc what flakko say. This vid fiye

Wack shit lyrics are fine but how he spit them is awful
Best music video of the year, and he better get his credit. I don't care what NBA fans say, video is LIKE THAT❤

Ya all under the same oath same agenda.. you’re a pawn just like he is.. nice video though seriously.. I can tell it’s the art for you but you’re still caught up.. and shining the light on someone else’s darkness won’t do anything but reflect a even bigger light back on your own 🤡 after all.. you should know this already “Enlightened Bryson” 😂😂😂
The flag ov uganda in the video ko is insane

YB is the literally the youngest child of the industry. Spoiled, emotional, and no matter what he does no one sees any wrong in it. He’s leading a whole generation of titty suckers.
I don’t know what’s wrong with bro, but this shiii asssss

This was fireee I can’t even lieeee 🔥🔥🔥
Nah, this shit is fire! 😂😂😂
Nothing wrong with trying something different the zesty parts he can keep but overall it's a actually song and music video! A for effort! Me personally I would've did the Tupac as the main theme instead of mj but still he did his thing
I fuck with it it's different goin against the odds i like that
Just me or in his breathing in the beginning, he is saying Yahweh .
Trash skip the garbage take this straight to the dump.  Prince i mean NLE just be number 2 shit every body can be MJ and you definitely not 😂😂
Here at 7am this a classic going down in history as the best diss song since 2pac hitemup!🔥🔥🔥💯
This nigga diss harder than Kendrick’s
BEST VIDEO EVER !!!! SO REFRESHING
Ugandan flag and south african in the video africans plz lets support NLE CHOPPA😊

Ass
Mane y’all hate buddy but the talent is crazy
the checkered floor is freemason and the fact that micheal jackson was in this facing the devil (the studio ceo he was fighting) this is just a diss video of how they killed micheal jackson, he is not paying homage to MJ they are literally mocking him, this is littered with freemason imagery
This is trash
NLE on his way to greatness!! One of the greatest lyricists of modern times.
Mj, tupac, a gangster, berry and Jude , bro’s going through an identity crisis 😂
He just bought his self a spot on grave digger mountain
This shit is garbage
This boy nuts
Full of illuminati art
Nle is iconic
Choreography TOP TEIR ✨️ 👌

Just because Top name is said .. That's why u got views 😂
Not gonna lie this was the first time I really took notice to NLE the MJ homage is super dope...MJ is the GOAT...so many people are making his legacy live on by paying homage I love to see it...that let's you know how amazing MJ was but this was a very creative video and the song is very catchy I actually enjoyed it and he did have some positive messages in it too! I liked it a lot 💕
Charleston White says you disqualified
This is crazy he spitting facts though these new dudes be sensitive like female's now😂
He deserves a Grammy for this.
Ok I’m not mad at it very entertaining

Kendrick Lamar better
This will go down as a top 15 diss track of all time. He snapped lyrically
He next’s going to end up dead somewhere else 😂😂😂😂😂
the instrumental is actually Dennis Edwards Don't look any further. You literally hear the vocals in the background. Hit em up samples it. But this is the original instrumental not the hit em up instrumental... BIG DIFFERENCE  MJ, Pac, Prince, Dennis Edwards, Chris Brown, Ali, Mike Tyson, Kendrick and Donald Glover Homage .. not imitation or copying. This hip hop. He paying respects to those before him. Freemason Checker Board y'all YNs can't break down simple art that's why YB music is so Garbage just surface level 💩
Good shit🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Video production crew appreciation button♥🔥
This is fucking ass
Who ever say this aint tight they a hater fr😂
This reminds me when Rozay made idols turn into rivals
Bro actually cooked
NLE or his team really creative and I'm here for it
Truth....this young boy character is a terrible influence on today's generation... remember, music is ENTERTAINMENT, not to be lived out
Kwa Hawa warembo wanne, ni nani unapenda dance moves zake zaidi uko TikTok mtu wangu😂😂
Checkered floor he definitely just joined the illuminati

He went off fr😂
He went crazy  on yb 😂😂- definitely some hypocrisy but  a good diss  😂
The creativity, dance moves, choreography, and the entertaining intensity of this video deserves to be recognized and lauded. NLE The Great aka NLE Choppa is showing us whatt a  lyrically inclined  diss with intense entertainment looks like. Some artist are laid back and deep( Kendrick). NLE THE Great aka NLE Choppa is intense and entertaining. The message in  the potrayals along with the lyrics are not getting enough attention. Look at the video, listen to the  lyrics. Every unapologetic artist often gets misunderstood or condemned by some for expressing their creative talent in what may be deemed unconventional and/or socially unaccepted.  That doesn't negate the vision, inspiration and creativity. What is seen as a change in personality or persona is often growth mentally as well as physically.  An unbiased look at this video will undoubtedly garner praise and kudos as a fire diss song/video. Not to mention it's critique of mediocre negativity .
I actually like this. Im not a fan of neither  but
Serious case of a obsessed fan turned into hater😂 song trash fa real i wouldn't buy this shit😂
Gang the song is tough but this goofy ass video fucks it up🤦🏾‍♂️❗️💯

MilkDuds head looking ass 😂
He tryna replace durk difference is niggas actually died in that beef 🤝
My true thoughts are: NLE THE PUPPET IS BEING A GOOD BOY  FOLLOWING  ORDERS FROM THE POWERLESS THAT WANT TO BE! JUST LIOK AT  WHITE CHECKERED FLOORS ..
lol Masonic checkerboard through out the whole video…. Nle not foolin nobody yall all sellouts and apart of some agenda to influence the youth
Video pretty gay can’t take it seriously with a nigga wearing a sparkle shirt
The video was dope but the lyrics are whack
King von would be proud of nle he's looking down like dats my brother
Uganda 🇺🇬 🇺🇬🇺🇬Africa what did we do😅
Nba started the beef now nle can't hold the disrespect anymore 🔥
Woke up with this sound ringing in my head
No way young boy can’t beat this diss track. This the hardest most creative diss track/music video ever. Name something more creative because I’d love to watch it. Can’t get enough of this video and I haven’t listen to much of NLEs’ music but I am definitely not a fan of NBA.
Chop did his thing
If YB don't answer it will be like when 2pac released hit em up and biggie didnt answer, but the question is what will YB b3 choosing, peace, surrender and protecting his own peace
He elevated to an elite musician with this one
South African's tap like if you noticed a flag💯💥
Everybody’s getting closer to God 🙏
That old sample love ❤❤

The fact that this mane danced through a whole diss song is crazy work 🔥🔥🔥

YB=🗑️
💀"YoungBoy what this is the big boy league"😂🔥 Straight facts😂😎
All I gotta say is this man has GOD BEHIND HIM HE CANT LOSE EVER
He's  cooking
This simultaneously the best and worst thing I’ve ever seen.
YB fans tweaking rn🔥💯
Nixkaz like you make me sick 😂
I like how u sound like him. .
This gonna go down as the most ass diss track of all time. 😂
This nigga going through an identity crisis smh💔
Let’s be real though… NLE don’t want no real smoke with YB

2:08 I am seeing country's and wondering. UGANDA 🇺🇬
I was walking right next to dude in the airport hallway and had no idea who this was until this red headed white girl ran up and asked for an autograph. Dude is so chill just blending in like it’s nothing😅
That shit was ass
I think the funny part is they both work for the devil one just works harder
He's just mad that YB didn't have to pander to the LGBTQ+ community in order to get where he is. He could've just asked for a collab, man.🤦🏾‍♀️
The amount of dick holding in these comments is crazy
This song is fire the message it portrays is powerful
MASSA NOOOO MASAAA
Honestly tired of the mumbling trappers rapper shit..one hard and clear rappin shit..good job
Ion think they listening to anything he sayin lol
I keep coming back to watch this video! NLE is a student of Kendrick Lamar and Danny Glover. 😩💯
Damn I respect the art.. his albums will be on repeat this week.
I fucks with nle that South African flag for no reason made me fuck with the boy even more 🇿🇦
He took the Donald Glover  "this is America" route. Serious song but comedic tone so it's easier to diges. Smart move.
Bro like 2 pac and Micheal Jackson at the same time
This tuff 🔥
Is NLE The Great is NLE Choppa?!
ngl I don’t why people saying he a wanna be 2 pac he looks exactly like him
Bro... this is hard. And gets more fire each time I listen
This video str8 from eminem in the 2000s
why do I really love this
Melly please tell this nigga to stop but this shiii right here was tuff and the last verse
I need to unsee this. I'm going to go listen to yb to clear my head. And I'm not returning ever
Here for the creativity alone
STAND W CHOPPA
If 2pac was a gay
Love the creativity need more of this
MOE kill 2pac and Micheal Jackson turning in their grave as am I typin this ninja made pac a gay rapper is insane wit back up dancer
Very creative video
👑🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
2:08 LL South Africa
Wild
We ain’t make u rich for dis bs
This song is giving kendrick lamar reincarnated but it's the goofy version 😂
Somebody get this man a trophy because this is video is Top Tier.
Reminds me of (no vasaline) when ice cube moved away from nwa and did that diss on them
its not no beef its not not clout cashing literally speaking his mind which is facts if it was clout chasin he would use yb anme in the title but the title literally KO nothing todo w yb he jus tellin how he feels smh
Instead of dissing YB why not just slide in his DMs and express your feelings instead of dissing him unprovoked? You're all about peace right? I feel like NLE forgot where he came from. All he used to rap about was violence. (Yet this song is full of violence with a line of positivity🙄) It reminds me of how some Christians act when they get "saved". They start putting others down forgetting that they were once "lost" themselves. What will this accomplish? Brother beefing with brother when they are literally two sides of the same coin. It seems very hypocritical imo.
So is everyone supposed to turn on YB now for NLE like they did Drake for Kendrick? The dih riding is astronomical. 🙄
Y’all can never make me hate this man
He snapped but the checkerboard floors thru me off
👎👎👎👎👎
This shit ain’t it cuddy idk 🤷‍♂️
🇿🇦
Let's goo 😂😂😂
Easily the best video this year

Trying to be @2pac and @kendrick lamar at the same time
We may never see the Old Choppa. But the newer Old Choppa is better. This is the best song since he left the Old lifestyle . other than SMO 1-3. keep going NLE
Me on my 10th replay listening and scrolling the comments with my hand and the other on some popcorn while smiling 😂
I like it 🔥
It’s funny how NLE had to wait until he got with Illuminati to diss NBA because they can’t touch each other as a Freemason secret society brother….but in reality they’re using two melanin men to humiliate each other 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
This kinda tuff
Ngl the video and concept is captivating.
Shit soo ass drop that “Youngboy free” track zip up yb pants whenever your finish
That was 🔥. Holy smokes
boy leave yb alone 😂 he gonna get back in your ass you ain’t bout it bro bro
Too feminine for me buddy
Nah this was very artistic. People don't understand that artist have to grow. The message  was deep asf so much people calling him gay.
I see mj, pac, Mohammad Ali, the youth and the stress in our culture
Geezus Christ NLE just stepped up to a whole nother level that we ain’t ever even heard of
https://youtube.com/shorts/IOjSHpKWXXg?si=GuC91dCVAaGtpdNl

🇺🇬ug👍🏾
This video wild 😂. But what I can say is not lying. It’s crazy to me that every successful rapper is supposed to be some sort of double agent sent to destroy the community, but we got a young man going around the country selling out arenas, and got people calling him “Masa”, and ain’t nobody saying shit.
🚮
He got the south african flag 🇿🇦🇿🇦 he finally sees his SA fans
What is dis
2Pac and biggie re incarnation?
You not Tupac this 🗑️
Can’t lie this go hard and I’m a yb fan 🤦🏾‍♀️

Why are you gay?
Man 2pac himself would of dismantled NLE The Great ☠️ this Nk
Nobody peeped how he was saying “ Yahweh” while breathing   It’s deep

All these rappers just diss each other for shock views they don’t really hate each other it’s just to stay relevant

It’s giving multiple personality disorder wit a sprinkle of schizophrenia 😳
This gotta be the weakest and wackest diss ever made😂
Entertaining to say the least. 🤷🏾‍♂️
Bring old NLE back
Wackest diss song ever
1:40 two piece
The history of beefing with YoungBoy as a line of individuals. He does not care easy gets mad due to havin no mind.

Why is he talking about a man that has been way bigger than him his hole career and is still the number one rapper right now and he his also imitating Michal Jackson I think he just wants to be as big as him and not fall of and why his he talking about the devil like that
don't know what i think of this. its good tho
3:13
This was just beautifully brilliant!👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾 I dig it! From start to finish
I won’t lie, this is one of the best music videos I’ve seen in a long time.
And don’t forget he played a big part of misdirecting the youth as well so you just as guilty homeboy
This is an Accountability Track. Not one Diss mentioned. ❤

Aye if this what needs to happen to get rap back on the charts so be it jus dont be offin eachother because the people who listen to you enough to put you on billboard cant relate to offin their opps on the regular. Thats why this rap fell off of charts. Time for substance NOT DRILL now that you got the mainstream attention or its gunna crash
He finally seen the bigger picture god has blessed you with money now use it the right way….
I agree with what nle is fighting against personally
Power together not against we already got enough against us as it is. When we will we wake up people
🇧🇷
Feel like This nigga crossing somelines hope he doesn’t step in it further…
This is art.

It's backwards the message is disguised as a diss.
HE COOKED ON SPIRITUAL LEVEL 😂🤦🏽‍♂️💯🔥
💌🌐♾️☦️✝️☪️☯️🕉️💟💯
Y'all are tripping and the devil is a lier. This is a false profit. Y'all just watched this man wiggle for a whole video and spank another man on a leash in a glitter shirt on a Masonic floor. In a recent interview he mentioned how he believes Jesus is not to be worshipped. JESUS IS KING. THE WAY. THE TRUTH. THE LIGHT. USE DISCERNMENT!!!!!!
Going the Tory lanez route with the flow mimic
Ain’t gonna lie, NLE got them dance moves down pack🤣😂
Bruh went crazy on the shit 🔥
NBA still on tour

My boy came with the choreography hahah!   Rap beef is healthy for the game..
I don’t even listen to Rap but the MESSAGE behind this I support. Gang, men beating women, drugs and violence this economy is in!! He should stick to delivering these type of messages 👏🏽✊🏽
Bro u kill take shit homie! So disrespectful, I love it.🍻🍻

Is that the Erica off of baddies gone wild at the end?
Say what you want. He the only One who wait for YB to get home to say how he feel.✍🏾💯🔥
Dressed and dancing like a fruit
To listen to this, you gotta watch the video for full concept 😂
This was kinda cute
My theme song
Nle u made a mistake carrying that mane head...
These yb driders cant accept the fact that this is straight facts and its a good song (youngboy is better though)
Hardest realist shit out
For all the “hypocrite” comments at 2:59 he thought of everything. 😂🤣
It’s a good video nobap

Did he go Bruce Lee
The production value is the diss😂 he is funny and smart for this. YB all iPhone.
why is bro balled
Are we allowed to twerk to this?! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I fw this. The choreography is smooth, the message is clear, and the visuals are fire. I don’t see nothing wrong with him paying homage to the greats. Beautiful art.
This gotto be some parody type shit 🤔 this nigga said “ if you cross that line dont stop any further” what does that mean really? It’s like a person who doesn’t really want to fight and keeps taking off clothes hold my hat, shirt , chain , shorts
I feel as if thou both artist are very talented and dope Time to putt the guns down guys. NlE the song is dope whole career been dope since the original shotta flow you been outstanding feel me y’all got children and are both fathers gang you guys both have a lot to live for and are already wealthy / rich with a way to provide for your entire family not everyone gets that opportunity as far as for the culture thou this was dope it’s about competition may the best win I get it hopefully one day y’all could collab that would go crazy and hopefully both sides would be able to get some money together and shake hands and make some great music in the studio
Wha am I listenin to🤣🤣
Ngl I fw this
VON gonna be so happy in heaven right now for this Choppa❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ K.O....you're a true Friend❤❤❤
I pray this stay in the studio not in the street😢
I don't know much about him but i don't know why this video tickled the heck out of me. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Well... NLE took a shot at the charts with this. They're saying no HipHop in the Top 40 on the billboards first time in 35 years. Let's see what happens next. The art was arting.
Sad but true folks 😢😮😂😂
Who here in 2026 bruh 💀💀

The video is artistic but this boy can't rap for shit
He had a whole dance routine, to a diss track, oiled down😅🤣😅
This got that ion know vibe it’s crazy
Ts trash
So it is a crime lol
Shalom 💪
Bruh😂😂😂
This song sounds dated, but in a good way.
why is nb hating wtf
Is it just me or does he look gay
This was beautiful 🤷‍♂️
Now that's what I'm talking about we need this type shih
The first half of the song is NLE Choppa. 2:18 is NLE The Great.
This so ass
Yb always gone be on top
This horrible wtf lol 😂 Jesus Christ man hip hop used to be dope now a days it’s all OG shit cuz new music like this is fucking awkward as fuuuuck ew how can anyone rock this shit ? lol do yourself a favor and go listen to hit em up -Tupac the 🐐
Why you got the South African flag ?
Im finna be screaming homboodyaayyyiiiooooo the rest of 2025.
He hit a home run for once in his career with this one. Great work and nice video. It’s going to be hard for YB to comebat this.
Nahh NBA youngboy got the streets in full effect
2pac probly rolling in his grave at this weak ass shyt like this dude done fucked up a whole song a classic at that, certain people shouldn’t touch certain shyt……
A fan beat you up for yb I promise you a nobody😂
NLE had three years to come up with a dish and this is what he comes up with… yeah let’s just leave it up to young boy now
0:38 belt to a** is crazy ong
Nle better
🥶
Now he know better 😂
TEAM NLE THE GREAT
yb better😂
Refreshing to hear something bold. Attracting people to his message.
NBA YoungBoy is not the guy to be going in the studios and rapping about it. I pray to God it stays in the studios.
On his ass 😂
I get it buh it’s just cringey I’m sorry
All I have to say is congratulations to NLE Choppa what you become  is an amazing artist thank you 🙏
Ko is all facts … nba young boy is feeding bad vibes and habits to the kids …
Love it
Video hard too much dancing for me tho
On some 2pac vibes
0:29 Cloutest move all year 🤡
i like it
As a 34 year old woman who has never been a fan of the newer young rappers.. I hate how much I love this. It's so good, though 😂
Confirmed!!! He is an agent!!! ...playing the opposition. There's plenty of symbols and signs in this video but I will just name a few for you. The big one, he is on the checkerboard floor....just at the the start of the video he has 3 6s up and 3 6s down using his hands (yin yan just like the black and white floor, masonic symbol for good and evil) ....also he was sticking his tongue out....hand on the mouth to symbolise the hush and oath they make when they join the masonic clubs.....there's plenty in this video. Don't fall for this!!!
IDC NOR GAF WHAT ANYBODY THINKS, BUT I FUCKING LOVE THE SONG & THE VIDEO….DIFFERENT AF AS IT IS SUPPOSE TO BE, HOPE HE KEEPS BRINGING ALL THIS BULL💩 TO LIFE😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨🤌🏾😌😎💯
It’s given Tupac 2025 I love it ❤
NLE’s success story inspires me sm. I pray to be on the same song with him someday. It’s not been easy.
Not sure why the dancing am I missing something
If this ain't the most creative most funniest but standing on business diss I ever seen.
All you DR ass YB fans can say whatever. He responded years later or he “hating” whatever the case may be but this shit actually catchy 😂
That's CB4 shit😂
I hate it
KO
This was awful . Embarrassing even smh i love NLE but this was ass 🤷🏽‍♀️
Buddy sorry got use YB for clout u will never be him he ur favorite rapper 🤣
Sad he is against himself.

Intro] Yahweh, Yahweh  [Chorus] K-O, K-O Hmm, voo-D-I-O Yahweh bomba ye Don't step any further (Ayy)  [Verse 1] I was quiet for a minute, now I'm breaking up the peace Insomnia, time to wake you niggas out ya sleep I say I'm on 'em, they in a coma, it's time to dome 'em Headshot, goner, you can smell the aroma YoungBoy, what? This the big boy league I put one up in your gut under the Jesus piece Last thing that I heard was "Jesus, please" Had me looking at the Devil like "This is your king?" Ain't no fun, when the rabbit got the gun, you run You just a pawn on the Devil chessboard, you done I'm trying to step some, bless some, wet one, stretch one What you can do, I can do better R.I.P. y'all altogether, all black in some leather I eat bullets and shit Berettas, rival with my Chiappa Winchester Bet yo' bottom dollar Top Shotta packin' heat Iron Mike, Cus D'Amato, I'll put a nigga to sleep We can bang this shit out for all the real niggas The house and the field niggas, I'm trill, nigga I rock nations, "Still nigga" Cut the head off the snake when I deal with 'em So it's on like Scarface, Al Capone Lucky Luciano, Don Vito Corleone And I'll bury all you cockroaches, where? In ya' homes, the catacombs Store the bones, I'ma leave smoking When the smoke clear, cry smoke of tears "It's Hunting Season" on the "Wall of Weird," head hunting souvenirs  Chorus] K-O, K-O Hmm, voo-D-I-O Yahweh bomba ye (If you cross that line) Don't step any further (Don't you step any further, nigga) K-O  [Verse 2] Purple reign, I'm strapped with two Glocks on me, twin flames Tryna bring a demon pain, I'm losing sane I got a bullet, engraved on it his name Clip like a dick, dump it 'til it's all gone, that's a sex change This shit get deeper than rap, can give a fuck 'bout the streets Yahweh sent me to decease 'em so I'm the reaper to greet 'em Andele, bombs away, down go the four Ten was the count (Nigga), but he don't want no mo' Let's see who macho for real Lock me in a room with you, I'll make ya pipsqueak squeal from his grill I'm gonna cock and let you taste the iron Blow your head off your neck like a dandelion, come on Bitch boy, sugar honey iced tea He a he-she man, brah, I'll put them lead carrots in yo' ass Now you're wearin' a colostomy bag for a pamper I'm cancer, I'm tryna cancel 'em  [Chorus] K-O (Man), K-O (Down) Hmm, voo-D-I-O (Clean up on aisle Tre, nigga) Yahweh bomba ye (If you cross that line) Don't step any further (Don't step any further, nigga)  Verse 3] You poison the youth, nothin' positive you do You the reason niggas beating bitches thinking that it's cute You send niggas to do what you wouldn't even do Role model, you will never fit the shoe, mm Just a nigga with emotion, a breastfed bitch Your aura give me the ick, niggas like you make me sick Money, power, guns, and a few drugged-out crash outs Make you think you the one who can lash out Fuck benefit of doubt, we all tryna make it out Tried to peace it up with ya, you the one that wanted clout Holding onto a image that you ain't really living Everybody that you rep on, I know who really did it, uh Can you feel it? The reaper want a visit Judgement Day around the corner, the Creator livid Purposely making decisions to promote mo' violence That's bringing mo' death unto his innocent children When I do it, it's different, when he do it, it's ignorant I'm in love with the art, he tearing people apart Embrace my light and my dark, why he ain't doing his part? Why he ain't doing his part? Why he ain't doing his part?  [Chorus] K-O (Man), K-O (Down) Hmm, voo-D-I-O (Clean up on aisle Tre, nigga) Ye (If you cross that line) Don't step any further (Don't you step any further, nigga, bow-bow) K-O (Man), K-O (Down) Hmm, voo-D-I-O (Clean up on aisle Tre, nigga) Yahweh bomba ye (If you cross that line) Don't step any further (Bow-bow-bow)  Outro] (Any further)

The crazy revelation about the whole thing is this reveals how trauma sick our black community is and how narcissistic this country is over power and control to set back and watch while deflecting what 1000’s of years of slavery has created
Don’t look any further, Get money, Hit’em Up, Way of life, & now KO.. big ups to whom made this classic beat!!

@jadedlove: Nle choppa is a clown ! The same stuff he preach against he does. I remember when he first started going on his “spiritual journey” he said he was done rapping about violence and guns etc and then turned around and kept rapping about it. He say one thing but his actions show different and now he wanna come at young boy… man get tf on. He just want some attention

🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽
God has blessed
He straight snapped on it I love it continue doing great thing NLE The Great
Rap been trash for years now
“Judgement Day Around Tha Corner, Tha Creator Livid”🔥🔥
So much to say here. Unless you actively listen to the old school rap music, you won’t see how they’ve used our music to attack and pretty much dumb down our youth. Yall cancel the rappers who’s message is for you to educate yourself and not fall into the system and promote the rappers who’s message is for you to pop pills, stay drugged out etc. and said rappers go along with it for the money but money can’t buy you into a system that was never for you. NLE I hope you continue on your path and reach the right people along the way ❤
To me he's a hypocrite.. So how are you saying young boy destroying the youth but at the same time basically saying how you'll kill him  threatening him throughout the whole video but you want to stop the  violence?..Nle dont wanna change nothing he just wants  Yb spot
This hard af an i dont even fuck with choppa and tbh he spit facts too! Yb 100% is guiding the youth in a very evil demonic direction
He upgraded ❤
I don't know if someone else have noticed but NLE has very deep knowledge in the esoteric. He is into the light but I'm amazed how much he knows about the occult powers in the industry and the stuff they worship. NLE uses their own knowledge, their own symbolism and attacks them back with the 4 letters (YHWH) All of this while dissing his former idol and displaying a masterpiece of a video and production.... brilliant !
Damn. Lyrics are real 🔥
He sending a message damn it's all make sense now ....the floors tells it all
Now everybody in that video is gonna die great
Y.B. snapped his finger and thought half the GaMe went away... NLE went back in time and took back them same Stones only to comeback not stronger but WISER then EVER......  #ENDGAME
This is wild
rip tupac
🇺🇬that's that Ugandan aura!

NLE really cooked with this one. The beat knocks, his flow’s sharp, and the hook’s been stuck in my head since the first listen. You can tell he’s back in that zone, this one’s got replay value for sure.
🌽
Why these rappers never have this much energy towards the whiten people that control them
Bro is mad Corny reaching trying stay relevant sh!t a$$ i hope youngboy doesn't respond to this gimmicky Rapper

🇺🇬
Creative as PHUCK it grew on me and once I saw the video I loved it even more
Huh what's wrong
I was rooting for him & the changes & growing he was Doing , welp I can now point Out to my little ones , I was Wrong about him , I will Continue to tell them , if nobody is Bothering you leave them alone you don't go looking for Trouble , because what your Looking for you will Find  , attention is ok but the Wrong attention can hurt you Down the road  in other areas & Business , it us Written put Away childish things  as a Parent  smh he's acting like Donor not what real man are Called in my opinion was Honored to my loved one what  your aren't Representing for your own Children any one can be & donor or daddy really Sad  trending  &  money is more important .
He didn’t tell a lie I guess
I’m sorry this is everything
Actually a good song and video. Why all the hate
Hope lil Tim ain’t hear this 🤣👿
He got down
I feel like Michael would’ve did work with you frfr
South Africa 🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🔥❤️
OMG in the beginning he breathing  Ya~h~weh OH MY!!! BROTHER CALLED ON THE MOST HIGH.  ITS UP.
Look at the white/black checkered floor
Some of the thing he say is contradicting idk think anyone else she's through some of B's he is say....don't get me wrong there are some great metaphors in the song but also some weird 1s just wondering if anyone else peeping
Culture 🎉🎉
Ah lawd NLE🤧
🗣️ TRASH 😂😂😂 wtf
Trash 🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️
idk bout this . yb better tho
This shit funny and hard at the same time… I see you NLE!!!! Speak the truth!!!! IF YOU CANT UNDERSTAND THE MESSAGE, you already lost in the sauce!!!! WAKE UP YNs
Ts trash ybbetter 💚
Can someone decode this
This the type of shit that comes out when there are no Rap records in the top 40; the youngins are drawing lines in the sand about what’s real and what isn’t again and it’s a beautiful thing.
A grey track and an even better music video. Considering a lot of rappers aim to act unbothered and nonchalant in their disses, it’s refreshing to seeing someone really commit to it as an art form
Damn this shit came outa nowhere  🪩 🪄 🕺
😇⚖️ We the heavens with you. We done negotiating.  Keeping your sleight clean.  Protection is yours  Choppa
Trash
по моему ему недолго осталось

This to Hollywood for me lol😂 if he about it fr should have did something in the streets not the booth 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
Even YB's mother said this nigga  tryna be Tupac and as for NBA it's that calls him Tupac 😂😂
IT'S 'BOMAYE' the real word during ali's fight in RDCongo that means ' kill him ' that come from my language the ' lingala '
That pooty thang reference is gold much respect for Trinidad and Tobago 🇹🇹
this guy made shotta flow btw

This shit hard n he saying all facts
He killed it. This is something NLE can pull off
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
This guy s NLE on a whooooooole other level: I can appreciate the creativity and the choreography because most rappers are to cool to really dance. Good job NLE but I hope this beef doesn’t ever hit the streets you know young boy fans are crazy.

🩸Nle fire .. slide for king von
❤
That new video is weak, bro. You dissing YoungBoy but using a recycled 2Pac beat — zero creativity. Then you in there hitting Michael Jackson moves like this a talent show, doing a full choreographed routine to a diss track aimed at a street rapper? Be for real. This the same dude who was online last year saying wild stuff about himself — now suddenly he’s “gangsta”?  People like y’all are why Black artists get treated like jokes. He’s still pushing violence, not peace, and ain’t adding nothing positive to the culture. Industry plant energy all day — baiting for clout. Dude just got off papers, and your goofy self decides to diss him? That’s some real fan behavior. Let’s be honest — if the song wasn’t about YB, it wouldn’t get any clicks.
you ate here NLE
nice knowin yah bro!
This song f**king sucks!!! I am 8 yrs old and gonna hit the glass pipe because of this song!!
Hard
They want NBA Youngboy To be in jail like durk this shit for politics propaganda war ! Yall influenced fr

Ts sucks
His ass so branded!!!!!!!
This is very creative. So much so it will go over a lot of folks heads
Uhhh😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 this 🔥🔥🔥 though
Nle The great
Who's idea was this, video visually throws the song off. Never seen a rapper with this much choreography. Listen, YoungBoy was bout that lifestyle he spit. You (NLE Chopper) went from drill to thot hoe, lgbqt zesty, gangster now this. YoungBoy moving the game and numbers represent him as the most original popular and successful artist. You seem to serve someone else's agenda for $
Revenge for von u promised
How the hell Did I  have this much fun watching a music video .. It was 🔥🔥🔥🔥
The bars in this song are crazy. Nle leveled up 🔥
Fck I sensed Tupac in this beat and Rhythm
3 Million Views In 2 Days Youngboy Somewhere Punching in the air rn hiding behind Lil Tim and lil dump 🤣😂🔥🔥🔥💯

Cornyyyyyy
Any Ugandan to talk about the flag
Wtf is going on here?? Im done..
goddddd dammmm nle warpath
This was funny 😂
This is hypocrisy tbh you dissing but in the same industry as well.  So what’s the point if you wanna make a difference leave the industry and advocate for this movement.  You are part of it as well.
And you disrespecting MJ.😢
Yb ab to come back wit the hardest diss ever.
damnn
A lot of salty YB fans right now 😂
The lyrics will go over YB’s fans heads 😂
Weak
Damn dude,why would you hate on ur brother
The best diss track ever😂😂
KO
My people are easily fooled. The Beast's hand is all over this record, while masquerading as a positive culture shift. Those who are able to see the signs & symbols, understand. Even those who are able to feel the frequency will know. This is a clear call for violence, not a departure from it. All this, from a young man who created his entire career and identity on violent, murderous music. Be not fooled. The Beast is attempting to stir the pot of death, and even the young man performing this song is unaware of his imminent, planned demise. This song and video is the first act of a deadly, nefarious ritual.
Nle,this goes down in history as one of the best diss videos and choreography dawg..,u killed this one
How long it take you to think this one up 😂😂
This shit is sooooo asssssssss no cap 😂😂😂😂😂
I thought Chris Brown was pop locking at first lmao 😂
He just sign his death ticket lol  I guess he mad cause the people say nba the next mike jack😅😅😅
He should have stayed on the chorus but his voice to soft for them verses
I give him credit for doing this video. It’s especially bold with everything going on. Hats off cheif
Bro in them other scenes looking like Chris Brown😂

There is no guy who attacks the NBA so that the city doesn't suffer. You are playing with your life. You already know that NBA is the best rapper and he is the best when he is in his prime. You are probably just looking for attention but you are not ready for this beef 😂 4kt for life💚😎

The video is beautiful it was different and he paid homage to all the greats for the people talking about I couldn't get with it that's because you don't know Prince that's because you don't know Michael Jackson that's because you don't know Muhammad Ali Mike Tyson in so many other greats that he was showcasing
Can’t cap this so tough 🔥🔥🔥💪🏾
Nle gang killed nba yb himey that passed the other week
Snapped.. it’s just different!
Tha guys said I had to watch since I been off the net. You gotta keep it a buck and see stuff unbiased. Def peep how he using paying homage to legends as a blanket for points, kno folks gone eat it up  cuz of the respect around the culture .And you Gotta admit it’s hypocritical when it come down to message to youth. He been flip flopping between all the, spiritual, shotta flow 10 and freak man music and antics. Now he tryna position hisself as “for the people” . All entertainment tho
Can I make a song with you on for Alabama I'm trying to get in the studio with you August 17th

NLE vs NBA is this generations Jeezy vs Gucci and I'm here for it
Just here for the choreography
The creativity out of this world
I feel bro. He sliding on demons. I’m on that same tip. So much spiritual warfare it’s time to be bold and outspoken about it. Gotta let the enemy know we working too! Just a little light can eliminate a lot of darkness. This is wayyyyy deeper than a simple rap beef.
This was a W beat who’s with me?👇
This shit Playlist
Omg this is amazing I love it so much
Damn clean up on aisle tre
You look dumb doing all this dissin….it’s okay you just lit up the spirits they’ll be waiting around the little corner for you!
This is why youngboy never broke is the GOAT 🐐 💯
Ye nle  the great we was waiting
NBA youngboy is so much better
Yo niggas think youngboy  superman of the hood bro i really dont think nle gotta be that worried from a diss
Bro spent so much money on production its corny
The beef started because nle was cool with king von and when von died nle said something about it and nba young boy diss him called nle a hoe and bitch and a d rider

You done crossed the line!😂😂😂🎉🎉
He forgot what happened to his boy von 🤦🏽
My brother, I love you. I’ve been watching you for a long time. I just think dissing YoungBoy is too far, bro. I don’t know if you’re gonna make it to tomorrow real stuff.
What's the South African flag doing here?
🔥🔥🔥

A zesty tupac shakur 😅
That bih hard
The choreography is so clean
Is it just me or is this something relative to tupac with his diss song title "hit em up"😅 I've been waiting for a comment 🤔
The Azazel reference is crazy🔥 this jawn art
loved ❤ big scorp energy🤤😬
CREATIVELY & GENUINELY GENIUS‼️🦾🔥🧊
Ok so straight out the gate this shit sucked I don't even know where to begin or what the motive was. 😂 This is the equivalent to bow wow creating a diss song and to add choreography to it makes it even more laughable. I was entertained so there you have it NLE you got my view. Congratulations on the greatest moment of your rap career which just so happened to be the cringiest thing I've ever viewed.
FIREEE!!!
Ok
🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮
Imma tell my kids this Chris Brown on a off night😭😭

Loyal #LLVon #freesmurk
I respect him a lot for this. It’s another beef not about beef.  Buuuut. I’m from BR and I wouldn’t play with them people. YB himself is the least  of your worries, it’s his flunkies.
Shitz wack
Bro their should be a boxing match between them not shooting
❤❤❤❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🎯
What a diss man 😂
If he did that, it means he is prepared.
This is a heavenly made masterpiece, from the choreography to the set to the lyrics. Truly an all-round fking amazing rapsong
YB gonna be toast if he doesn't respond strong
Damn cuhhh killttttt this bit

“Clean up on aisle trey 🥷🏽 😂😂😂🔥🔥”
Listen at the lyrics from 2:18 nle saying nba poisoning the youth its true he telling them kill
Who else saw the Ugandan flag 🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬
Abana Uganda Jemuli Nkimanyi muzunga
This song buns
Nah this is fire ion care if he dissed yb he bringing back the competitiveness of the rap industry if you got a problem blame kendrick
Rap as a whole in new true talent is in a dump rite now this nle is what we need💯
This is so ass and embarrassing. This is the behavior of someone who’s biggest dream was being noticed by his idol but his own idol doesn’t even recognizes or likes him so he needs to spread his hate towards him acting like he’s doing something right even though he’s just digging his own grave cause of pride and second hand embarrassment. Corny just like Dax.
Wow.. I guess bots have shit taste.
These lyrics are crazy from nle.....he looks like Chris brown in this
I’ve never seen more people mad that a dude is tryna change his image for the better and be a better role model to the youth.
Yall acting like he didn’t look up to him yb like ya but then he got close to him and sees what kinda snake he is so now he dissing him. Like when he said you sending people out to do shit you wouldn’t ever do and then the dude shot NLE in the back
Nle never half asses anything!!!!
Nle pulling out no stops even bringing back the 2pac beat and diss feel
Yeah he killed it with this one ☝️ frfr!!
I can not stop watching this!!!
Skip to 2:19 thank me later
Blow your head off your neck like a dandelion bars
Yo wtf happened to nle his not the same nle I know
Nba Yongboy finna send some heat
It’s about time someone did it to him!!! Good call nle
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
South Africa  with you
He need attention so bad
Basically he calling YB the devil
Scorpios we very calculated, smart, not afraid of a soul, we don’t miss🔥🔥🔥
If Chris brown and 2pac had a lil brother , it’s this nikka lmao
Sickkkkkkkk diss
Truth, we need to lead, not follow. We need our men home, not in the slave system, being boy toy
He's a hypocrite😂😂😂😂 he came out rapping the same crap but he's talking about it😂😂😂
This fool just said 8 months ago he didn't have a problem with YB and wasn't picking sides ... Lmao dude just mad  YB filling stadiums to the MAX 😂
Rapping not for everyone, bro made Spotify filed a noise complaint 🙏💔
Jesus christ is LORD.
Damn, NLE Went crazy on this 🔥
He gay😂
Ts goes Hard on muted🔥🔥
Gone get put up😂
This is fire
Bro Ready be the next KING von🙏😭
Bro if speaking facts. I’m riding with KO
You kilt it frfr🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
clean up on aisle gey nga
The whole Tupac stuff is weak.  NBA is a real killa nle made same music as NBA.  Weirdest video ever
When it comes to music videos the creativity was amazing, (Missy Elliot) was the queen of music videos in my eyes but this video was neck to neck with Missy... Good job nle
bra this shit is so ass
U on that same boat bish so walk that plank
That looks like 21 sav
Son 😢U FINALLY GOT MICHAEL JACKSON ATTENTION
Pride will be the downfall of both these artist
🔥🔥
🔥🔥
This shit hard but ion think he want that rn if so oh well let god be over us all
Yoh! Nle killed this song I don't care who says waht. He kinda remind me of Tory Lanez,
How the hell this dude can come up with this concept this border line genius
It’s a lot going on on here
Idk nle
2m's in 2days? Gahdang!! 🔥
Bro want clout
Sokka has better feats and battle IQ. It's not even that close
😂😂😂
i got NLE up 1-0 rn🔥🔥🔥🔥
He not doing 2.8 million in two days
Rap style LL Cool J's Bigger and Deffer album and early days of Pac Death Row records a lil Beastie Boys as well....Shit all the 80s and 90s mixed RB and rap.....Awesome❤
Say FIRST OFF THIS THE SAME NICCA THAT MOVED OUT THE COUNTRY CUZ HE WAS SCARED FOR HIS life ..... I'll wait ..... On another note the Song is Below Average.... The Video Gives Sweet Nigga Vibes and you shaved yo head, Hope the deity you are praising is Stronger than this Song Cuz there is something that these Entities all Fall Under and that's UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE 🤔THIS is a complete Power Grab, he had to build up his Courage and now he speaking on sum..... U see I wouldn't be Surprise if Somebody is unalived before the end of the year, you say YoungBoy is promoting Violence but u drop a diss track", So what does that promote?? UNITY? MAKE it make Sense if you are trying to find yourself as an artist there are more Beneficial ways to do it and Clout Chasing ain't Gon get it...... But I'm juz talking pay me no mind.....
This shi hard tho⛽️⛽️⛽️
👍👍👍👍👍👍😁😁😁😁😎😎😎😎
Tory Lanez flow
The sad part is that YB isn’t creative enough to even respond to this…. And I’m a YB fan since day 1. This is just put together really well… and YB just can’t touch that artistic creative side at all.
rip fake gangster nle choppa
I’ve heard this beat wtf is that from
This video is creative but I see now calling nba a devil and he’s supposed to be like a representation of the opposing angelic forces …Hillarious
I feel like he did this outta hate and I feel like this isn't something he'll spit.. it's like he was forced to do it 😂 he tryna do with drake did to Kendrick 😂😂
Maaan wtf did I just watch 😔 this was a horrible idea my dude 😂 🚮
Bro cooked young boy badly💀
Do people actually listen to this and think it’s fire 😂
4kt 💚
Shot calling
Peanut head ah
Yb better 💚
🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
Lol I ain't wanna say this about yb performing that von diss. But how he ended with clean up on aisle trey shows it is. This not gone end well
All the Masonic symbols don’t fool the discernment …
Never In my whole life seen nothing like this I never seen a rap dance video like this in my life I don't know wether it' was good or bad I'm tripping lol smh
This was fire tho
2:21Thank you 3pac🙏
Video crazy. Lyrics decent and much respect
He yo janny
Love Love Love ❤❤❤ Do your father's work!!! You are alot like Tupac y'all both entertainers not just "rappers"!!! Weapons will form but they will not prosper!!! You might be ahead of your time I hope not cause it's time for a revolution 🖤🖤🖤
Aye no shit I ain’t never seen a rap song with real dance choreography this shit kinda hard to
if you glaze tf outta kendrick this should be up y'all alley
I don’t endorse beef, but musically he ripped this 💯
This is trash
Usually don't comment on videos but I support this! Stay true King
Art❤
Bro went from gangsta to save to freaky to Tupac / mj wtf is this a created player 😂😂😂
I like the song & the video
Okay 👍
Straight classic. This is art and at it's very best. Pure perfection 💯
2Pac 22😂🫵
Like does he really think this is a good song? Does he know his garbage or what I would’ve been laughing hard as hell I was young boy.
🦉
Yup I get it. And it's his timing he had too. It's the YAHWEY FOR ME WHEN HE WAS RUNNING AND BREATHING. THE BREATH OF LIFE. YEAH. WE ALL TRYNA MAKE IT OUT.
Nle is still a fan boy of yb and wanna be yb so bad and he also rap about if I was a girl I would f me too and slut me out like boy go sit your sweet weak ass diss somewhere .yb better 😂
WTF THIS CARTCHY AF
I been saying for years YB working double as a fake artist cause his music is straight trash NLE just said more in this one track than all 35 NBA YB albums 😂😂 idc what anyone says he a agent for some organization
We haven’t seen this man in so long why now does he wants to come and diss yb that’s clearly saying u want attention
🎉🎉
Wack asf
Mzansi lekae??
I don't really listen to neither but I know bout both and I love this. The fact he went at yall king had and ran off with his head chopped off. He mixed up some Pac and Michael Jackson in this was genius
Had to delete my other comment, just cause I didn’t feel right when I kept hearing the yahweh chant. Look to Jesus everyone, stay prayed up. 🙏🏽
So You wanna see Yb Creative 👀  Be Careful what you wish For ..
Young boy Gonna respond with no time no thought no effort
This  a shot at the whole black history
Love from Australia 🖤💛❤️
The video is definitely art, but the song ain't gonna stop youngboy
Yb better
BRO SAID EMBRACE THE LIGHT IN MY DARK WHY AINT YOU DOING YO PARTTTTTT GODDDAMNNNNN
Bro, this is not it. I had to leave multiple comments. This is the trashy street weird dude shit ever bye dude.
What is he talking about in this song and what is this dancing in the ball head and the gyrating of his hips this man is fool fool do do
Trash 🗑️
Can’t lie, this actually goes hard
Has anyone noticed that this is the Tupac diss. Nice work
I like yb but he ain’t going harder than this and I’ve never even messed with nle. Just what it is bro transformed into his final form.
I’m a older lady so I had no idea who this young man was and so I started seeing some things on social media about him calling out on the other rapper for specifically damaging the youth and once I saw the video I completely agree. I’m a fan now and I wish his young man nothing but success. This was a visual masterpiece. I enjoyed the video very much and I wish him massive success and I hope that he creates a genre of rap music that is different than the typical hatred for black women disdain for family culture, and loving one another I hopehe starts a new trend of loving one another and Black power I really do.
Nle the mister cop yo flow and master it
Bru this shi so ass yb better
Yall are delusional asf the man knew he wasn't going nowhere so he came after yb who's career is at a great peak right now for what CLOUT foh this song trash asf and no im not a yb fan but this was not it nle just go back to chilling bro let yb live his life you live yours
Man just talented
We got 3pac dissin yb🤣🤣🔥🔥
Real 🥷
Ybtch better not fck with NLE Choppa before he get another dent in his head
❤❤❤💯💯💯💯💯💯
NLEEEEE
Too deep, many ppl won't get it. You did your big one and the message was loud for those with ears
🗑️
People say that rap fell off the top 40 since 1990 but this will put the genre back on for a moment.
Can't hate he snapped 🤣🤣🤣
If a dude talked this much shit about me, I'm a go get em.
Trying too hard to be another Tupac.
Man always 30 and calling himself youngboy if you have any type of awareness you get what NLE is saying . Obviously he been recorded this
0:37  nba young boy and king von is crazy
Cant wait this beef getting bigger
Masonic imagery both pawns 😊
They love to turn to god after signing the contract and getting paid by the devil.. it don’t work like that
the yb fanboys in the comments got me cryin😭😭😭
Ppl saying it is hypothetical yes he was rapping the same as yb but he's rlly saying he mature n yb still rapping the same shit n putting out for von ❤ rip von but yall need to study deeper to rap and music to understand the whole picture
I don’t know, but I love this video❤
Another nice one! ❤
Pusha T GO AT DRAKE WHO SUPPOSED TO BE A GREAT. So GET EM NLE
I pray whoever reading this gets robbed at gunpoint. 🙏
This garbage
Maaaan its soooo many things people missed in this video...i jist caught the 1 showing YB's mom and dad thay was standing on the side about to fight. Theres a picture of Yb mom holdinh him when he was little with that same outfit on, and his dad whos is prison. Everybody has been calling YB the new MJ, and theyre using the same demonic imagery they did for Thriller, but MJ was showing the future then. Even in the making of Thriller he showed u they were going to transform him into someone u wouldnt recognize. Ur a fool if u dont see the demonic imagery at the YB shows. They're literally in hell with fallen angels in the background. He coming out of a casket. He said himself everything hes involved in is very demonic. Looks like in this video nLE IS showing how YB is really a slave. He probably dont want to do nothing hes doing. He said hes terrified of people get they got him being ambushed by people in the middle of the street...Yb did start bucking at 1 point then they drugged him and put him in prison until he learned how to act...U can see in his shows hes exhaused. Everytime he does a photoshoot with the political people who looks pissed not happy. Also NLE showed how they changed Tupac from the Revolutionary Black Power person who tried to take the cigarette out of Yb's hand...Into the gang banginh thug...(In this video) Right b4 the "Hitman" pulls the trigger, he moves out the way, and it hits the actor playing YB. Then he turns into the gang banging tupac throwing up signs...Basically saying The Thug version of Tupac is what influenced YB & most of the youth instead of the Revolutionary Tupac...Also im pretty sure everybody sees the black & white masonic chessboard which MJ and alot of other artist have shown. I DONT U can truly sell ur soul because its not urs to sell, but u can sell ur image and likeness. Some artist realized it & startef tryinh to secretly tell people through certain slang & signs what was up & once people start catching on they take the artist out just incase anybody who they impacted gets any bright ideas they want u to think they decide ur fate when in reality they dont. Ur image is just that...an image. Its not u in full...Who you were 2 days ago may not be who u are today. Thats why its not good to condemn bu5 judge by the fruits of someones action in full & its hard to do that with an artist who u dont know so just look at anying u see as entertainment or look for a trick in it. Depends on what seed u have in u, will determine what u see and take in.. some of us listen to understand & some just hear
Bro this hard but some of these fits suss af haha! Ain’t no way ahaha.
Man give NLE credit!! Videos are actually creative and entertaining! Tired of folks sit in front of a store and record in front of that bih… good job man
Grow you hair back
BRO THIS ISH HARDDDD!!!!!!!!
I’m not gone hold you this was beautiful ❤️
This song catchy & it shows how that little boi Ybtch was a false flagger all along
A lot of the yb fans don’t even see the true message behind the song that’s the craziest part.
Im not lie bro killed this and ik in the gloves YB cant fight 😂
At least I can understand the lyrics…plus I like clean up on aisle Tre:)
MJ and 2pac is back
This fire
he hit quando with a bottle now just hit yb with a bang lol❤🗣️🗣️🗣️ nle the great like a mfer
Straight clown 😂😂
Still lyrically talented and full of positive vibes, but he just needs to be himself. Feels like he switches personas every few years-now he's 'The Great, channeling Tupac and dissing the devil and NBAYB. Lol it's more like NLE The Switcher who keeps switching characters
Okay tinkerbell
Can feel the Tupac vibe in it
Um this was ass to me and I don’t like YB at all.
This is desperate asf all NBA young boy needs is a mic and camera and you do all this looking zest at that man stop
as someone who’s not actually a “fan” of either, i don’t listen to NLE or YB, i have to hand it to NLE. one thing that is funny tho, is that they’re basically the same person but in different fonts.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
he chasing it and we giving it to him 😭
YB not even gone Respond to This 😂😅
Bruh this is the wackiest diss ever bruh tf you on

STOP IT!!!!!! This Shit took me back to 2pac and biggie, everyone was laughing until the whole world was crying 😢
Yb still better
💯💯💯
This video is NLE
Dope AF but let's talk bout the black and white checker board with red outfit over the checkerboard plus the purple lighting in the background free masonry and devil worship
This shit is terrible. I thought it was a parody or a skit. NBA shouldn’t even respond to this goofy shit.
Wtf is wrong wit yo bald headed aass
Why the Ugandan flag in the song though 🥹🥹
SOUTH AFICA
Wow this really is different and inspiring as a rap artist as well. The Tupac and Michael Jackson vibes as well. So much to point out , it’s fire 🔥
Are yall hearing him though!!??
😂😂😂😂😂
This shit hard
Sheesh😔
Rick Ross was a fan of Birdman! Then he hit him with Idols to Rivals… shit happens!
🇿🇼👍
Boy look like Tupac you know nbayounboy will kill you the top slime king better delete that diss track I'm for real
Nle really did this in da name of Christ 🙏
You wasted a great video on a dis record?!!!
Erica from baddies?!?!?!?
“Know like I know” still better than this shit😭😭😭
Dam yb really got you this pressed 🤣🤣this shyt trash too if you maybe stop meat ridin and think about your career you would make better music ‼️‼️
This shit is 🔥
I mean yall both make the same music and this still promoting violence but good take on it tho 🤷🏿‍♂️🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
TOO LATE... THE BEEF IS OVER. HE JUST KILLED NBA
The old nle is back
This jawn suck yb can make 16 million views in 2 days
What u go do if u get sued like drake did Kendrick. What u go do if they buy yo contracts 😂. Yo YouTube check going to never broke again. But I doubt they worry bout suing. Some other rappers woulda sued u
Ngga talking ab one individual but everyone inna rap game do the exact same, including u 😂
Thats wack
Nah he hit the griddy😂😂😂

Only closed minded, ignorant, non cultured, homophobic people won't like this video! So please expose yourself.
🙏🔥
🎉🎉🎉 up h
What u dissing for u a hater in u said yb was yo favorite rapper
This heat because all the role models not even role models they just have material shit and status which is what the majority think is right but what the “role models “ are putting out is not something to follow the real prophets are here now all this ruckus must fall.
Hummdiddy-e-i-o
yo chill bru
😂😂😂
Aye I can’t lie! The lyrics and visuals are art fr. I’ve watched this video maybe 100 times. The Michael Jackson views are my fav. Dude really smooth wit it. I love creativity and even if you don’t like him. This the best video I’ve seen in years!! No drugs, body shaking, woman fully clothed, and fyeee choreography! Ppl hate to love it, but this junt fye! I feel like he’s speaking on killing the evil demonic spirits within the man, not the man.
Humiliation ritual so easy to spot
We have finally woken up as a people! No longer enslaved by our own destruction. Glory be to God!
Lets see what nba young boy say😮😮😮😮😮😮the song is soooo good❤❤❤❤❤❤❤i love both of them❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
That “Ali, bomaye!” moment everyone’s hearing in KO actually traces back to Muhammad Ali’s 1974 Rumble in the Jungle in Zaire (DRC). The people chanted in Lingala, “Ali, bomaye!” — meaning “Ali, kill him!” It wasn’t just about violence; it was about power, pride, and legacy — a Black champion standing tall before the world and his people cheering him on.  When NLE Choppa channels that energy, he’s not simply “dissing” someone. He’s drawing from a long tradition of Black excellence, resilience, and artistry — the same spirit that lived in Prince, Michael Jackson, Tupac Shakur, and so many others who transformed pain, rhythm, and struggle into greatness.  Now, let’s clear something up: that beat everyone calls “a 2Pac beat” isn’t truly his. It’s a sample from Dennis Edwards’ Don’t Look Any Further — a soulful classic that 2Pac famously used but didn’t create. By using it again, NLE Choppa isn’t copying; he’s continuing a cultural conversation, reminding us how music passes through generations, evolving but never losing its roots.  So when you watch that video or hear that song, don’t just hear the sound — listen to the lineage. He’s representing a spectrum of greatness that stretches from the boxing ring to the recording booth, from the ancestors to today’s youth. But if you don’t know your Black history — if you don’t know the art, the icons, and the battles fought before the beat dropped — it’ll go right over your head.  Because this isn’t just music. It’s a mirror of our culture, our creativity, and our crown.
People actually like this very surprised
this is catchy asf
I am not a fan of YB either. I am a fan of music. “He killed this track” y’all must be listening with your eyes. This song should not have 2.8 mill in 2 days. Disney ass diss track.

Fucc the beef and diss as a artist this was the most creative video from a rapper alone nd well orchestrated
This shit is ass. HOLE
If u go make a diss come way better especially a yb diss?? Dude wtff
He signed to Death Row. Check out the chain when the song first comes on, he up now.

He got that pac mentality
This a 1 and done for men watching this visual wasn’t it
Keep it lit young boy shouldn’t even respond. Choppa ain’t even close to be on yb level
Fuck The Bullshit All Young Boy Do Is Rap Bout Killing,He Is A Bad Influence On The Young Generation But It's Takes An Adult To Realize That.
Yall hear the ben ten diss and the lul tim diss in this too...I may be wrong on the ben 10 when he say its supposed to last 10 rounds but he said im not the one wearing the colosomy bag
The black and white checkered floor speaks volumes
I dont give a damn about your stupid song.
Masonic checkerboard on full display
This is how we fight Darkness ‼️💚💙💜💛🪄☀️🪢💪🏿💯 FREE MALACHI Z YORK‼️‼️‼️
Its all for marketing it aint real beef, yall should know this smh
Almost 3 million in 2 days. The world so messed up, it’s like we waiting on the next murderous beef. I like the song. I don’t wanna see them boys beef. Make music, independently or together but get money. Nle, this ain’t you. NBA on that.
“For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son so that anyone who believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life” John 3:16. Jesus died and resurrected so YOUR sins could be forgiven. He loves you so much He suffered and gave His life for you so you may believe in Him and have eternal life. Change your heart and turn to Jesus. “Jesus said to him, ‘I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.’” John 14:6. Jesus is the answer to all things and the only way to have true peace and eternal life after this world.
Yb 4l💚
Anyone else here 4m Uganda 🇺🇬🎶🎵🤟

He ain’t lyin.  NBA sound like shit when he raps and his music is demonic asf.  You

NLE Breezy
Video of the year.
happy britday
Just here to say thank you for taking a moment to show off our amazing Ugandan Flag 🇺🇬❤
Lowkey a banger tho I been listening too it a lot
Ain't gone lie ion like bro but he snapped on this shit
This was fire 🔥 art work and all but mane Dissing YB shit gone turn out bad shoulda left that alone and stayed in your lane
Cooked YB Nut Ass 😂🔥🔥
Been years aince i heard NLE GET THAT SHIT BOI!!
YB gotta come up with some creative BS😂 not some “me and my gang will pop you outside when you walk out grab your gun and show me what you talking”😂 and screaming in the mic and off beat asf😂
Clean up on aisle tray 😂😂😂😂.  Going to bang this today.
Man that’s boyyoung
Why the hell would you diss nba youngboy
This guy drop a tab of acid or something? Wasn't he just singing about percocets and one night stands?
PERFECT & cute
Cuz did his thing and I’m giving him credit on them Italian gangsters names cause most people get them wrong especially lucky Luciano
The video is beautiful visually, lyrics ehh. I don’t understand why he’s targeting young boy, and  not all rappers, who paved the way, with derogatory lyrics, drug use and violence. He could have collabed with positive rappers, I see people making comments like we need this…. When Kendrick, drake and j Cole was beefing and j Cole a positive, talanted rapper apologized publicly and said he wouldn’t engage people were talking bad about him. Yb a product of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Bird man is his mentor, this video is more of a threat than positivity. There are active post about other rappers putting hands on women. The hype for this is weird. When we have talanted positive rappers who have been positive but ppl saying we need this, this video is bs lyrics and violent. Carrying his head, whipping him with a belt, I don’t understand the goal.
can't take him serious after the quondo rondo beef.
Weak
Trash
this shit is so ass
He ate NBA up now they mad its just a diss song YB have one ijs...
Its funny how he said all this but between the feminine moves and the devils chess board you are doing most of the deception...   .... all have dark tendency's
This shit 🔥
Not going to lie youngboy actually cool. But lyrically he can't mess with nle so battle really over. This might be one of best if not best diss ever bro speaking nothing but facts🤷🏿‍♂️💯🔥. To rap bout killing him without actually rapping bout killing him🔥💯. He did say he would whoop him couple times. I would pay see that my money on nle.
Mann downn
He killed yb career 😂😂😂😂
😂😂 this depressing, he sound like a idiot troll disrespecting legends music smh. should've used your normal beat for a diss. This isn't it fake gangsta.
Man I tried so hard to like this mfk song but this shit is so ass 😂😂
God bless….. that shit was a masterpiece
He talking bout murder too
Naw try again this ain't it bruh
The versatility of NLE is crazy and I feel like he's only starting to really experiment
Man, I felt the creative art MOVE on this joint baw!!! Felt like an embodiment of Kendrick, Tupac, Hopsin, Slim Shady, some Prince & Michael packed into the all time punch of Iron Mike Tyson spit from the soul of NLE Choppa!!! Man, cuhzo dat shit was PRESSHA
Sounding like it got tht way of life mannie fresh beat slash pac beat
Why the Ugandan flag thou
A lil zesty but hes right i guess 😂 what inspiration do you get from yb? Pain emotions hurt smoking cigs 😂😂😂 dude be stressing. Nle you get a lil spritituality health macking hoes with game not fame.
One question… why ?
Damn I’m actually impressed! Bro has put in a crazy amount of work to grow into the best version of himself. Respect it! And he bringing mad numbers back to hiphop. I celebrate NLE!
I hope young boy accepts this studio beef and keep it in the yo and keep the good music goin
Some of the bars cool and real but for the most part this song trash . I just hope bro on his ps and qs in real life
This sh* only doing numbers because he dissed yb your other sh* got ghost views
Ooooh 🫢🩶
This is EPIC!!
Fuck rap this shit trash 😂😂😂 rip hip hop
Like this so I can come back hear again 😭 that boy went in  🔥🔥💯

Yo y'all dont hear the message what this Man is saying! Realist I've heard from this generation
Bro got 2 million in 2 days off the strength off TOP😭
December 2026??
I like it cause he put that old school vibe in it
Rap can gaf about the streets . 💯
I only watched 5 seconds and already annoyed
Nle went off on this
Young boy fan or not this shyt go hard.
Heres the thing. Nle 100% is a better role model BUT if you aint consistant conscious rap like kendrick cole etc YOU SOLD YOUR SOUL TOO. if you dont like  dude cool but dont talk about role models. Bra was spitting and the creativity  was obviously off the chain but that first outfit was zesty af! And what man wanna see a dude blowing kisses winking and sticking his tongue out mulitple times this aint no rnb shit for the ladies !
This nigga whole career took off from him doing the exact sasme sh*t poisinging the youth  MR. YOUNGBOY MY FAVOERITE RAPPER lookin a**, just becuase you want to be enlightned now nigga you would not have went as far with ya career with the church boy sh*t  you really wanted to do lets b legit
Bros got more views in two days on this video than he does on the last like 2 years of releasing music bros a weirdo two free young boy songs becoming a wannabe tupac shaved his head became a fake god preacher stopped that started making his own herbs stopped? And then he’s dancing like mj in the video like dawg doesn’t even know what he wants a little bit of this that and the other lmfao like pick a struggle dawg

I Fck with it bro
Leave that man alone mind ya business  You be spreading that freaky ass music around to the youth no artist is perfect NLE lame for this but I like the video kinda cool but ain’t all that Yb better
Don’t let that checkered floor go over your heads
This is wack af lmao 😂 and clean up on aisle Trey. You corny as hell. The whole time dissin someone and sayin you’ll put him under subliminally, and then say he’s poisoning the youth. Lmao 😂 you just as much part of the problem. If not bigger, you had a choice to stay on the porch. Most of us that actually live this life. Didn’t have a choice. Due to lack of guidance, role model, education, choices, etc. most of us envy ppl that had that, no matter how successful we become. That’s what makes you a clown fr.
Amazing visuals and a good diss track.  It's hypocritical to say he poisons the youth when you rap about the same things and you cool with it when Durk and Von do it.
Everybody who don't like YoungBoy is going to like this no matter if it's corny or not.
As a 59 year old dialysis patient, I smiled today!! Thank you NLE !! Well said young man. I"M BACK!
Minus all the funny visuals... he really snapped like deeply.. and then the overall theme from the very first intro 😮‍💨😮‍💨 man I don't think you caught what just happened. Listen to this in the car bro I'm telling you 👌🏾
NLE THE GREATEST 🫡
3:36 is where Nle choppa he lost my respect you can’t say yb posing the youth , if you cut his head off in video and  had ran down the street like be real , that’s beyond violating you asking to get murked 💯 song was lyrical can’t lie but you lost a nga when you did that shii at the end cut my nga head off but say yb is dripping straight murder music lol ngas be clout chasin
Keep Pressing Forward NLE I have been with you since lay em down and watched you transform your mind i love you King ❤
This the sassiest diss video I ever saw the rap ain’t that bad but the video ain’t it
How do you make a diss song about a man you try so hard to be like 😂
Yb gonna blow this out the water 🤣 just go back to nle choppa yu not the greatest
THANK YOU YB FINNA DROP ANOTHER GOOD ASS SONG U NEEDA REMEMBER WHO YOU DADDY IS NLE IM JUST SAYING YB DA GOAT
Yoo young boy is just a kid😂
Enlightened Choppa 🔥✨
That’s Hip Hop great job!!!
I was bumping Nle way back around same time as yb started taking off ,song good but video wasn’t needed not like this , cutting yb head off at the end is like you asking for somebody to do it to you , like think about the disrespect the song ain’t had it’s lyrical , but cutting yb head off at the end then running down the street with it is a stretch and overly violating , still disrespecting no way you would take that good , somebody getting a clone then cutting they head off and it’s you think about that , can’t say yb positing the youth if you just cut my man head off then ran down the street with it like you rocky balboa , if y’all Nle fans imma admit it’s a lyrical song but y’all gotta admit him cutting yb head off is violating and he asking to get put under , every street nga not gone react the same imagine the nba y’all was saying was a demon king von or durk wouldn’t let this slide a nga making a clone then cutting they head off and running with it 💯🗣️think on that before y’all say yb only make murder music , he just violated cutting a nga head off that’s murder 🚦🚦🚦
Don’t look any further beat ❤
My country uganda🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬

This visual is fire alone . He’s going to need a reward on this video 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
He got bars if you listen. 🔥🔥
Dang belt to ass lol young boy I guess you dealing with a grown man now he is evolving I like to see this.. elevation is key he is standing on the light side not the dark. Props to choppa for even speaking on it and standing on it. He know exactly what he is doing he knows nba energy and willing to push the same energy back and willing to die for it chose a side light or dark killing the kids and rapping about it not good we losing a lot .. again props to nle elevation and standing with the most high. He is also portraying all the greats from prince, to Tyson , Micheal Jackson,2 pac, Muhammad Ali all on some righteousness and showing he is growing up as a man spiritually if know now’s what he is doing wake up.
🤢🤧🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮

You can tell NLE learned a lot from Kendrick Lamar .
Ko
Amazing job, keep it up.
Glad he done making diddy booty music.
Masonic square… I already know
im surprised yb didn’t drop a diss yet but this shit ass it’s hot buns😂😂😂 I love nle choppa music but when he had dreads and didn’t fall off and rap goofy ass shit but hey i cant blame him he is a lil rusty at rapping good but this is asscheeks I hate Tupac’s music but even his music is better than this big steamy pile of shit song . (It’s my opinion so I don’t give a flying fuck about what y’all say about what I said because it’s the truth and I’m being honest to god that this shit is ass 😂) I love his music but the 41 song and this one are the only ones I fucking hate and NLE choppa if you are reading this and if you’re gonna reply I didn’t mean this in a negative way I’m just being honest but I’m just worried about you and your career the rumors about you falling off are true there on YouTube trust me you’ll see them there everywhere ❤❤❤ pls nle stop acting soft and go back to gangster choppa plsssssss❤❤
God finally answered to my prayers nle finally I've been waiting for years 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁🫵🫵🫵🙏

Nah nigga this ain't it😂😂🤦
Shit is really ass yb better I thought it might’ve been better than this but he genuinely a fan of yb and mad he ain’t at the top
He said he in love with the art and its proof
He makes 2pac and michael look bad and he looked feminine😂😂😂😂😂 this shit hot 🚮🚮🚮
AI YOUNGBOY- NO Response
That’s the og Grape street crip🍇
All the death that came from beefin with Von is crazy to do this brothers lost they life and he out here playing his a$$ goofy. But he the real puppet he really made a whole song about young boy lol thats whennyou know they love you fr and a hater at the same time
NLE ahh been writing this one for years. Ight say bet cant bash YB for a world that is already corrupted thoo theres more behind this starting with trump. Id say you should have dropped something more peaceful or leave it alone shii it was all cool for the longest now you gon start a war back up dat already buried itself fam but aye lets see wat top gotta say cause uk he gon say something too
SECRETS⭐POOR HEALTH ⭐ALL SOURCE OF PROBLEMS ⭐YOU FUCKED YOUR LIFE UP⭐⭐IS ALL YOUR FAULT ⭐STOP ASKING FOR MONEY ⭐ IF YOU ARE A******** LIER
aint nobody dissing yb dressed as michael jackson 💀😭😭😭
I told you guys when I saw him in that interview pretending he was getting closer to God that he was a culture vulture. This man has no intention of offering us good music he has every intention of bastarding everything we have done with music so far. To be honest he looks gross with his head shaved. Even nastier with those lies spilling out his mouth. He was better off just staying the young idiot he was before. Like the more when he wasn't two faced
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Y dude why play wit fire
The YB Adlibbs lol this some good shit
Okay so it's giving Muhammad Ali, 2 pac, Micheal Jackson, and 50 cent.

Gayest diss ever
Never thought I would say this but I might be a genuine fan of bro. I think I judged wrongly because this is amazing.. feels like something that came out 15 years ago in the best of ways. Wish this much thought and effort went in to half what was put out nowadays.
this beef is not a beef only reason NLE CHOPPA STEPED IN IS BECAUSE VON HE LOVED KING VON THIS MAN IS LOOKING AFTER VON SON AND NEPHEW BUT HE STARTED COOL THEN WHEN VON DIED EVERYBODY PICK A SIDE .
Youngboy finna get him bad😂

He showing how nba sold his soul
@hopsin you not slick😂
This is hilarious
Shoutout to NLE The Great, we see you showing love🇿🇦🇺🇬
Dude real like Schizophrenic .
IMPORTANT TO READ: NLE IS NOT YAHWEH ONLY JESUS IS AND HE IS THE MESIAH!! DO NOT BELIEVE OR ASSOCIATE NLE AS YAHWEH!!  Dear Bryson LaShun Potts,   Honestly from my heart I say “ take out the log in your eye before picking at the speck in your brother’s eye.” Do not have these kids dancing out murder in the body mind and spirt, don’t lead astray the son of man. Be a beacon of light that only shines from Jesus, that light will be the message and it will have the youth and all singing in love. Use the talents GOD blessed you with for his will, his way, in his likeness.   “Nobody comes to the father but through me” - JESUS CHRIST.
I’m so proud of you 😢😢😢❤
Ay this isn’t a bad song overall but I think an original beat would have been a better choice . When you bring pac into things it’s hard to meet that bar ! . But I commend him for continuing to grow and not be in a box with his music . That’s a win!
Ts trash get off yb d
This is bad
🗑️🚮

Yo this is hot
This video is tuff asf
🏁 floors.
I was born March 1976, and have been in love with hip hop my ENTIRE life. I listen to it ALL when it comes to the music!!! I see the genius in this video: the homage to 2Pac (Hit ‘Em Up), as well as the homage to Michael Jackson (Smooth Criminal). Lyrically, it wasn’t NLE’s best work. If you take the video away, lyrically if was weak, but, and I’m not making excuses, most diss songs are due to the limited subject matter. If you listen to “Hit ‘Em Up,” “Ether,” “Back To Back,” “The Ripper Strikes Back,” “Super Ugly,” and the list goes on, it’s not that lyrically these songs were up there, it was who they were dissing. But they all had good punch lines or memorable 1-liners. This song did not, but it IS the best video of them ALL!!! And the lyrics aren’t horrible.
This is Memphis  talent
The video is fire but the bars were pretty bad. Message was on point but man the bars were bad.
Pac is rolling in his grave 😭😭
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ I get it it’s deeper than a dancing. This is what you call artistry you get out of the normal and show people something different from different angles. While delivering a message.
South Africa gather here 🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
This video is 🔥 btw
Such a deeper message. ❤️
🙆🏽‍♂️🔥🔥🔥

I think 🤔 he's showing that He's One of the Greatest. I Appreciate his New Art.  It's something New and different to look at and listen to.
Dude is not 2PAC so he need to not use 2PACS shii like that also dude thinks he really doin something here. He’s not he made himself look so GOOFY and RETARDED like why are you even trying to insult MJ and 2PAC like that dude and YB gonna make a big comeback and if he don’t it’s because NLE is a joke and isn’t anyone to take seriously. He needs to be workin on somethin that’s actually worth listening to because this bs was not it.
🔥🔥🔥🔥 when have you ever seen a rapper dance like that?!?! 🔥🔥 COLDDDDDD & bars w/ messages!! 💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥
This reminds me of a 2pac song I fuck with the bald head I usually do mine bald to bekuz of 2pac I love 2pac

Him so hurt that young boy cracked his girl babymother . He had to see the same DM’s that YB showed, he better chill bcz Top said he got so many videos slutting her out and keeping her locked up in the back house 😂
Gangster Micheal Jackson.
Dammmm love the king von lines hiddN in it

Travis Payne also choreographed Michael Jackson’s, This is it until he “overdosed”.
You're obsessed with Legends...YB, Mj and Kendrick

Reminds me of old ludicrous, missy Elliot, busta rhymes, Eminem vids
Don’t forget this guy has a ssi check for his disorder. He has to much energy. He should’ve just danced backup for mic-jac or 2pac.   By the way those movies you be acting in sucks
Youngboy is going to blow you up  It's slime💚
Did nle just dopped a micheal Jackson look alike music Video with beats combined from micheal Jackson and pac  thid shit is fire🔥❤
Locking in
I like this young King. SALUTE!!!

I LOVE THE HOOK I DONT CARE. 🔥❤️
The world been waiting on a nigga like you!!! Don’t fucking stop keep applying pressure!!
Weirdo 😂😂😂😂😂
The message is there, but the dancing discredit it a lot.
Buddy got alot going on whatever message yall took from this run with it
Dayummm NLE! I couldnt find a crumb if I tried 🧐🤣🤣🤣❤❤❤❤❤
South Africa watching tap in 🇿🇦❤❤❤📌
NBA YB made Stop The violence while NLE was acting G@Y
On modern standards, its not hitting. The message is definitely good, but most aren’t awake enough to see. Young boy music is good and catchy, but he is poisoning the youth like NLE mentioned. Wonderful message tho
nle bald my new crush 😂😩
Pac is back in the form of Nle for NBA YB😂😂😂
YB must go to studio now... Let's see if he can top this 🇿🇦🥵🤞🏿😂
This is lowkey 🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Gay asab 😂😂😂😂
NLE is pushing a small giant even tho this is lyricaly better than anything yb put out but yb reach is longer so NLE need to switch all the fake yb fans if hes going to win
Vraiment du lourd
The hate smh
It's to much tf going on in this video and why is this nigga rapping but dancing like a zesty Micheal Jackson ion like it then u go from a super fan of YB to dissing for maken the same ass music NLE make I think jit loosing it bored need attention for his favorite artist it's borderline G word
Why you dissing him for than you try to sound like him for a few seconds. He didn't do anything to y'all but hold his own
MJ moves that insane
all dissing aside, the song and the video is tuff
Big Memphis!! 💪🏾

Nle can’t even rap.
NBA is still the great.
Nigga really sat down for some minutes for this🔥🔥🔥 nle 1-0 yb
Bro this so badd, like trashhh forced ahh rap. This guy has zero pen skills, I mean just baddd
Checkerd board … paying respect to his masters, they both part of the same club… however young boy seems like he regrets being part of the club.. YB is going to squash this 💩 if he responds
Cant lie... I dont even think YB have it in him to compete against this artistry. Lyrically maybe, but artistry... No.
boah Hals Maul!

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Im here to see what the hooplah about ?
Glad a young nigga told this young generation to stop following these so called "demons".... This generation is smoked out
SO DERRIVATIVE IT HURTS...DEAD INDUSTRY.
This mf watch JoJo
There’s no message here, it’s just a continuation of the same old shit and negativity but just re evolved . Evil will always be and the weak minded will submit as always.

What on earth happened to Choppa
He dissed a drill rapper wit no gun 😂 fire 🔥

Dancing on a checkered floor …. Oh
WTF Is This 🤣🤣 👎🏾
Evil communication corrupt good manners
This sh*t hard bro😂😂😂😂
YAHWEH
He body this song beginning to end 💯💯
New choppa cool but unless you bring back that Memphis YN Camelot/shotta flow type energy, you ain’t winning against YB bro fr
The absolute art put into this. I grew up in the 90s and NLE just brought them chills down my body for the first time in almost 20 years. He embodied the best of the best snd integrated them all in one and just listen to those lyrics, spoke magic 🎩
Amen claim and receive it ✝️🙏🏾
Finally!!!! Change the culture 🔥 love this!!!! 👏🏻
I LISTEN HIT THEM UP
I usually don't like these types of rappers. But that last verse was some real shit. He said NBA YB is poisoning the youth, hitting girl like its cute, sending his fans to do what he wouldn't do, ect,ect. He's just having a druged out crash out and he's not really about that life. Only when he high he does "g" shit. He said you want to keep your people in the hood doing dumbass shit that will get then killed or locked up. Again, real shit. I doubt NBA response will be this creative or good. Probably just the same old "I'll kill your ass. I got hitters. You do the same shit. You a lil bitch." Type response.
hell nah😂
It's a Sassy 🥷🏾 Apocalypse
I listen young boy alot but this song cold ngl my bwoy young boy has to go in the studio for this.
WHATS RAP DOING MAN GAY SHIT THATS IT ...
Yo why he gave yb a hightop tho 😭😭😭

He wanna be everybody but his self
Start making movies let rap go u a actor

NLE: 1  NBA: 0😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Some pac typer gangster
Oh yeah idk how young boy gonna combat on this one 😮
Black and white tiles of floor ?
Don’t let em fool ya
This instantly got added to my Playlist. I love all the homage to all the greats and I like how he used Dennis Edward's song (the original version) and Tupac Hit em up version (which is a sample of Dennis Edward's song). The creative is unique and different and unique and different is always better versus ppl that just throw a diss video together and dont have no creative thoughts behind it all. Visionary.
Dropping bars on AA + 💣🔥💣🔥💣
HE KEEEPINNNGGGG RAP ALIVE I LIKE HIM!!!!!!
You killed it Gang🙌🔥❤️
THISSSS THE ONEEEEEEEEEE
Dope. No respect for anybody disrespecting the dead. Young boy a twat for that.
Janny
That was one of the best diss videos I've seen. His lyrics are bad and the video is fun. Very creative. The last part wasn't really necessary though.
Damn I may have sleeping on NLE.
🔥
Ye you is cook
Was bro running with YB head 😂😂😂 I can’t lie this was creative AF fam and will be very hard for someone to hate on 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Creativity at its Best🔥📍  I'm seeing; Tupac, Michael Jackson, mike Tyson, Mohammed Ali ,Chris brown 🔥✅
You can literally tell that it's something YB doing behind the scene for NLE to be ready to come out of retirement.
ybbetter,clout chaser...you aint ready for whats cookin
Only putting Uganda flag in ur video can make this go viral more and more ask French Montana
💚yb better
LLN
You just a nigga with emotions 😭 send people to do what you wouldn’t even do 💯
NLE Won Already GG Youngboy
Ngl this go hard hahaha

2:22 That looks exactly like hit him up 😂😂 crazy
NLE you are so creative and I love it.
If this was a JD Vance diss it would've been way funnier
He is speaking facts NBA Youngboy is definitely not helping our black community or any other benefit from his music. He promotes crashouts. NBA you don’t even have to respond bro just do better.
This shit gay as hell 😂😂😂😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Dennis Edwards instrumental 💯💥💯 most people know as the 2pac hit em up beat

NLE is being a Chamillion while being creative to get attention and likes
The sprite of 2pac lives on ❤
Idk what I’m feeling , at one point I’m like this shit goes hard then at the same time I’m like this is hilarious. Bro is confusing my feelings lol 😆

I fuck with NLE Choppa and YoungBoy putting yourself out there in this song so I ain’t got no size just a fan but seriously both parties got so much money not saying they’re not gangster but come on y’all don’t have the hood problems no more unless you’re dumb enough, put yourself in the hood problems that you work so hard to get out it’s all good entertainment to me in FP dumb enough to wander your money frame. Hard work Empire built of your blood swing tears get your story on how you wanna end it.
3:41 yo thats crazyy work brooo he really don’t like kentrell but hard ahh song

Hopsin vibes with a tupac flow Love the diss
Js so yall know the reason he drop ts is bc yb chose a side against king Von and since nle and Von were close nle sided wit von. LLKV also to the ppl thinking yb will win i dont think yall realize the resources and manpower nle has and how real he rly is
This fire!
Ts is so buns
Pulling for NLE here

Of course uses the free masonry black and white floor devils puppets.
We need to bring back queer bashers button==>
I'm not the biggest fan of either artist but this is pretty damn good bro! Excited to hear YB response!
A lot of potential
I was a closet Slt Szn fan so I am beyond proud to see the evolution! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Nobody is going to go in their car and play this song. He knew the music video would only be the only thing bringing views bc the song by itself sounds dumb asf and how sad of a artist you have to be to make another man who’s a (#1 TRENDING ARTIST and the MOST LOVED BY THE WHOLE WORLD) the whole topic of a song just for clout and views 😅 he’s a clown and i hope he enjoy’s this temporary no hit wonder song of 2025 bc seems like he hasnt done numbers ina while! he had to speak on another artist just to get views and his name talked about in the media 🤣🤣
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
bros so ass 😭
Yeah he ain’t gone make it too 2026
0:58 I’m rocnation still ni66a is basically letting you know this is Jay Z behind this going at his long lost music mogul rival Birdman’s protege in NBA Youngboy. I tried to make it make sense as much as possible.

Anyone else imagine a mosquito singing the high pitch part?
He came with that Kendrick energy and the top diss beat of all time 😂
We really need to give NLE props for the choreography and cinematography cause. I’ve picked up a few Easter Eggs. It’s a dope video not the hardest song but it’s pretty good.
WHO
THANKS FOR PROMOTING THE UGANDAN FLAG 🇺🇬
Why dissing each other instead of working together ??
This some creative work! lol
I see those checkered floors, you know what that means. 🏁
Nle  might be cooked😊
Free Mason checkered floors. He is a goner, sold his soul.
@NLEtheGreat I just started listening to your music g. Why you gotta end yo career like this? 😂 Creative but if you gonna do the whole MJ thing you gotta hit them moves like you Chris Brown otherwise it just comes off cornballish. Also the flow seemed rushed like you were nervous to do it. Artistically speaking this one wasn’t your best.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yall crazy this is 🚮🚮
Thx for this Yb about to drop the best banger of his career… RIP Choppa fr tho
4:19 mins wasted 🤦‍♂️
How are you gonna insult and diss a man for promoting violence and every other line in the song be about killing him? You don’t know God, Heretic.

nle best be careful brotha we know when you spread this positive message the opposition well they try to hurt you.
This shit is 🗑️ that's why I don't listen to a lot of these YN's music

He bumped this hoe, yb fans mad ash 😂😂 yb gotta respond with a banger
This is not personal.. it’s spiritual warfare.. remove the viewpoint off the person & see the spirit.. evil is being called out publicly.. those who walk w God truly understand its deeper than it just being NLE vs YB
Clean up on isle 3🫡
Dude give off the his whole security team booty bandit vibes
Ass!

I like the song but is this the same person that made shota flow?
Prefect shot yes sirr 🎉❤

Worst song in history.
Trash bubba dub voice!

Pac wouldn't go for this
👀  I don't understand his motive You can't serve two master's    It's giving jealousy  Who sent em?  I don't understand y someone would put so much energy and money into a video about another man  It's love low key  Meanwhile NBA young boy on tour getting paid out the asssss  Do you hear me 🔥

I’m really HIM YALL
Lmao young boy  better not respond to this clown
I don’t know what NLE Acronym means. Stay focused , spoken well sir. Keep Yahweh first , reward will come to the ones who see life through the eyes of the most high.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I mean hes speaking facts if you think about, today's rap role models are teaching violence even to little kids. At a yb concert this yn beat up this old white security guard just for doing his job.
its not even hard on mute bro wtf
💯🔥🔥🔥
Bro LISTEN TO THE LYRICS AT THE END ISH.. Yall Youngboy fans literally proving nle’s point on how he’s poisoning the youth and only solve things with violence and killings all tied up to Youngboy selling his soul and spreading evil  and ybs time coming soon dats why he doin all these shows
BLACK TOM MCDONALD DOPE AND LOVABLE BUT DISSING WHO IS NOT WOKE IS NEVER A TOPIC.
This song suck ass but this one of best music videos as of lately tbh.
Love the messages .. everything you said is nothing but the truth .. if people get mad about these true messages you are rapping the truth about .. then that just mean the old saying .. THE TRUTH HURTS ..
Omg!!!!! YESSSSSS
3:44 Erica frm baddies
If this was Drake Everybody would love it
I see all the Illuminati symbols and the checker floor a death is coming
Bored & needed something to do smh beat it corny ass
This might actually be in the top 3 yb disses fr. You got 38k by jaydayoungin and some guy named “i fell down to my kneeeeees, when the law came”
Evolution of the great 🙏 the video is wild to 💪
I love then both but music don't make nobody do nothing they did that on their own. They picked thr part they wanted .Just like people di the bible
I love this shit nle been showed he ain’t no lil punk he no real music fuck youngboy 😊
🔥🔥🔥
This is the most cornball shit I've ever seen from nle bro got like 10 different costumes dancing like nbas background dancers💀💀💀
I normally don't listen to music like this but the fact that 2pac and Michael Jackson were represented in this video . Definitely caught my attention and this artist can definitely dance and left a great impression on me with this video. Awesome work and very talented 👏 loved it ❤
Niooccee
This crazy work I never seen so much fruity energy in a diss song
No choppa i don't want you to get killed PLEASE
You not Tupac or MJ be yo self 😂u ass now nle
Bro wtf
Mans said clean up on aisle Tre😭.
Nle Choppa Did not lie abt nba youngboy yall trippin on brudda
Let em hate bro you at 2.5M views lol and I know that stream money kicking in lol 😂😂😂🔥
If I was you I would stay in the house fr
I ain’t gon’ lie, I never took NLE Choppa serious bro try too hard to sound deep one day and chase clout the next. I been rockin’ with YB from the jump, and he don’t need no gimmicks or dances to prove he real. Choppa be talkin’ ‘bout peace and energy but still throw shade online like it’s high school. Meanwhile, YB drop a tape from the house and break the internet without even tryin’. That’s the difference I ride for the one who built his own lane, not the one still tryna find it.
foe ian gone lie he snapped🤣🤣🤣
I’m from Louisiana. I’m white. I’m an “old head” and I really haven’t given a shit about rap since Pac died. I thought the whole Kendrick and Drake shit was corny but I really do like NLE. I REALLY don’t like YB. I think he’s the gayest dude to ever come out of Louisiana and a lot of people here in Nola do not claim this dude. Any man who says his “s’s” like that has some sugar in his tank. His fans are gayer than him. I was very very troubled to see how many dudes on bourbon street went full blown sissy over him a week or so ago. I’m glad NLE went after him and I’m glad he brought his A game when using a Tupac beat and did t disrespect it. I’m siding with him. He’s entertaining, has a sense of humor, makes kids laugh and is good to his fans. Seems like YB is the exact opposite of that. Plus I don’t want a bolegged zesty dude representing my state.
😂💯nba bouta calmly diss him
🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋
everything he do is just corny
He should have called this Zesty Ass 😂
Yb finna end his whole career 😂
I swear to God this reminds me of in living colors😅😅😂

Funny, wasn’t even trending #1 for a day.   And at that, the only way to get a trending #1 song is to make it all about YB. 😂

NLE a whole comedian. He was spitting facts tho  😅😅
Love this video but I would’ve used a white man as the devil!
Don’t get me wrong he got some dance moves, but in the music was very created but at the same time, but he is a hypocrite how you gonna call a young boy when you used to did it first when you came out
😒
YB is a damn BRAT with money! Always yelling at 🥷 lol someone needs to slap that lil man boi

This one envious ninjs
Poor guy 😂 Makin LA Gangs look foolish gang going to lose alotta stripes. PLUS YOU WENT FOR NBA YOUNGBOY…. Remember dis comment 😂
Youngboy ain't made a hit like this since he been home 😂😂😂🤧💯  #steppedonhisneck
I dont like that he addresses YB and not the fans- YB can say what he wants, he should be held responsible for what grown adults do in the streets and the parents that let there kids be thugs. Yes he is a source of many violence, but YB is nowhere near the person to blame, as many, many law abiding citizens listen to him as well. This feels like NLE was pushed to do this if im being honest- YB doesn't break records, hit the radio, nor really make himself known beyond rap- he isn't the issue. He's just a dude profiting off of people's taste in music.
idc about time they call mfs out stop poising the youth the new generations need better examples “it’s not their job to be examples” promoting ts ain’t it either no matter what their songs promote it. this is art, back then our artists showed art and msgs, spirit, political, whatever warfare it’s out there it’s happening wake up. children and families being kidnapped and seperated while they lie to the media that it’s not true. facism happening in front of us. Free Palestine Free Congo Free Sudan FUCK ICE. idc if yall think this is too much or nle not saying what im saying but i am wake tf up.
😂😂😂😂😂
AWWW SHIT
It’s cuz he was close to von he been fuck yb
We are watching from South Africa 🇿🇦 NLE the Great understood thee Assignment.. It's all Love Brother great creativity truly artistic.  God Bless
This video production gives off MJ vibes and man, this was creative and well said 🔥🫡
You can hate all you want and I like yb music but he went crazy I can't lie...
This shit sucks😂

You can't make it big in today's music industry unless you're a z3sty gangsta willing to rap and teach the youth about killing or hurting your own people. It's just what the j3w-ish music CEOs wanted for our people, a nation of z3sty, doped-up, want a be thugs, gangstas, crash out artists, tricks, hookers, hos and johns, and it's exactly what they got & we allowed it, shame on all you ngas.

This that modern day Prince vs Mike Jackson beef😂
Yall praise women beaters, buddy passing around Herp. Like it’s all good. It’s crazy. NLE ALL DAY
Very creative but tbh I can’t hear half of what he’s saying… even after playing it in the car
This is embarrassing to hip hop...
Actually tlkn det shit
I don't even listen to him fr but he ate n left no crumbs
Clout chasing at its finest…
I’m having mixed feelings lol. I love the creativity it reminds me of how videos used to be back in the day. However, I’m a lil confused with the strong emphasis on him dancing? I understand the idea of paying homage to the greats and I’m guessing he’s trying to align himself with that. But where in his career does he hold that weight. Very experimental and worked but is it sustainable?
nle kilt this ngl 😂
Come on nle this ain’t it u know nba going to come back with a lot of shit to say abt the music video
AYYYEEEE LETS GO N.L.E IM TURNT TF UP YOUNGBOY DISSED YOU FIRST YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO RESPOND ANYTIME YOU WANT TO...AND DID I MENTION I LOVE BOTH YALL NIGGAS

Hear me out, it seems inspired by "Hit em up" Even the outfit is similar to Pac.

Dissed lul pab
Kids calling me unk at 30 idc THIS SHIT WAS FIRE🔥🔥🔥🔥
This shit fire! So creative. This is Art.
This is so 🌽 eee. He thought he did something, but nobody respects him or takes his opinions seriously. Deep down, he wants to be YB (I don’t even like YB), but you can tell he’s mad because YB rejected him a long time ago. He doesn’t know who he wants to be, so he dresses up as every popular musician for clout and to stay relevant.
😂😂😂😂 my new new for the whole winter
No cap he went off on this
This the same guy who made walk em down 😮
Keep going on this type  of music NLE It’s actually really good🔥🔥

🚮
First fruity Diss track I've ever seen 😂
He still telling the truth regardless if he’s being a hypocrite or not. He not lying. Black culture needs to be reset. Ask yourself if you want your future kids idolizing people who promote violence.
Can someone explain to me why there’s South African flag up in here? 🇿🇦🇿🇦
Love the 2pac and M Jackson references
This Is Embarrassing 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Everybody talking about he ate tf he even saying something to him for foh when he rap the same shit everybody else do foh
As someone who enjoys both of their music, this was hella creative and NEEDED. It’s ART! Relevancy is cool and all but ART withstands the test of time! And his lyricism was on point too. I don’t think it takes away from either rapper, but this song definitely gives you perspective. Say what you want about NLE this mf was cold
Trash boy! Who In The feelings Singing About Another Man!! LoL.. Never Heard Of This Character!
The real ones hear you bro.
Hell yea do it for von do it for durk
Got that checkered flooring in there 🤨
Garbage
RIP in advance NLE🥀
🚮
You don’t even get a million views on most of your videos anymore.
Mf making waves like kendrick and drake...  All because abunch of weirdos wanna swing on youngboys nuts when he is one of the worst artists to ever grace the genre of rap. Yb fans are a fucking embarrassment.  💯
Dude you slow as buddy you talking about
He killed NBA on some real shit like speaking facts the fact youngboy has poisoned the youth I mean look at his fans had those yns that beat the shit out that old dude that works security and NBA didn't even respond to my knowledge crazy

Ngl creativity A+ i loveee the creativity & effort that he put into making this video. I haven’t seen creativity like this from an artist in a very long time! But i still haven’t found the purpose of him making a diss towards Youngboy 🤷🏾‍♂️🤔 especially when he’s speaking on pushing peace but rapping about violence that’s confusing but w/e i just hope that they can resolve w/e they have going on w/o any bs. 😩🤞🏾🙏🏾
He don’t won’t real Beef💯 he want YB to bring him the VIEWERS BACK😭👎🏽
Old choppa back

Stop  dissing my favorite rapper bx
Michael Jackson and Tupac would be proud, that's a tough message.
his career ain’t going great so let me diss YB 3 years later because I want to be notice. Most views of any video ever because of who YB. Can’t compete where you don’t compare
The fact so many people commenting about the fucking music video is comical.   Youre more focused on the visual.   And that goes without saying thats how heavily you are tuning in.   Its like childish gambinos visuals on the This Is America video...  And who tf is actually defending and listening to yb in the first place? People should be embarassed lmao. At least this defines rap. Some of yall out there truly want yb to redefine it with absolute dog shit material. 💯🤣
You done gng😂😂😂
Nle plss don’t piss me off omg this is buns but all i know is yb about to make a big banger comeback
This is smooth…gansta..funny and creative all the same damn time…love it ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Lil curtis keep a switch wtf is this
Would be crazy if yb nd nle otp with each other and they planned dis out 😂
YB BETTER
I’m confused af! I gotta watch this at least 3 more times to see if I like it or not😅
Kendrick Lamar directed this video 😅
Who you shot nle? You do realize YB gonna have a way harder song lol
This shi hard asf no cap🤝🏿
Another ungrateful immigrant 😮😮😮😮😮😮 fuck them.

He thought about this video the scenes go crazy 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I think I heard the part of the song that started it. He said he tried to peace it up with him ! You know him and Von was best friends let him tell it ! so now Lil Durk in jail Von dead don’t try to peace it up with me now ! you know how young boy feel so he probably hung up on him or dissed him  and told him fu*k  you ! And this is what we get !
What in the Vic Mensa is going on here

Yb ain’t poison a youth dat he just a product of what the black community has become we was already cooked bro you gotta understand he was 15 and famous and already came from struggle you can’t hate on someone who came from some so bad and down him cuz he emotional.

I ain’t ever heard of NLE until Kirk Franklin podcast. I’m a church boy but I gotta say, I mess with dude now. Bro calling out a whole generation brainwashed by toxic rap lyrics. Not to mention dude got choreographed dances in the video this was pure art. 😂

This came up as an add (watching It Is What It Is). This the first song I'm hearing from NLE.   I need to go check his catalogue, if this is how he's sounding.
Free SMURK !
The gayest shit i ever seen,
The guy went from free youngboy to this ? 😂 what happened to lemon squeeze?
Goteeem ay this go hard bro I'm rockin wit NLE frfr 🔥

The real KO is YB's 80 million dollar tour revenue.
Great video and song lil bro 🫡
See you picked up some wisdom from Panic
they should get in the ring mma,,, everyone will pay to watch dat
He pushing the gay agenda to much.
Tryin to get views. that's all this is.
I never listened to NLE but this rap at its finest, you took a page from Kendrick Lamar and I salute that!
😂
Trash
If anyone is seeing tots, believe in yourself and put yourself out there. We all saw a probes of this diss yesterday. 24 hours later, 2+million views. Believe in yourself and put yourself out there, we love a good reel
Directed by The Most High Yah!!! All praises to TMH Ba Ha Shem Ha Mashiach. I do not support any brothers beefing. With that being said this was a phenomenal production. The song, the beat, the artistic expression. Incredible.
The beat sound like a Motorola cricket phone ringtone you buy by texting 555555
Oh he snapped with this!
Yall may say whatever about NLE CHOPPA BUT HE is talented when it comes to dancing and choreography young boy never done that
Industry is making rappers more feminine by the day
🚮
I thought he was Chris Brown dancing like Michael
i dont jam neither one of this cats but this diss is weak you could of taking your time and write something better
I like yb but damn NLE ate. This shit🔥🔥🔥🔥
It’s giving Directed by Lil Nas X
Just to clarify the message for anybody who doesn’t get it …. He’s showing a few black historical figures and explaining how NBA youngboy is an embarrassment to black culture promoting the youth to tote 🔫, Rob, abuse, treat women poorly and more …… this was actually a great message .
RIP to NLE
Yb gone kill you in lyrics and irl 😂😂😂😂😂
I’m a fan of both, n this is straight art right here 🔥🔥🔥😮‍💨 nle went crazy
Nice dance moves I guess
Don’t never sample a legend

Whack😂
Banger
He killed this shit lol
Well damn!!!!  that was unexpected!!! All eyes on YB and how he responds
I listen to Y.B. and I can unbiasly say the song was good. The video is questionable but the lyrics 🧑🏾‍🍳💋. My only question is where did this hostility come from??? Didn’t he make a free Yb song
Want to be Tupac
Idk why NLE making himself a target when he a nice guy smh I like him. Wish he come to his senses
And yb do be rapping all extra aggressive like this song come on only 10 seconds yb already mad on the song like bro this was needed
Nle talking about the devil and that’s yb king but I bet he wouldn’t say the same thing about  von
Half these comment forget nle was a gang memeber b4 the fame
Man this hip hop ain’t one nigga finna just ball in this game fuck nba young boy him a Kodak over praised
#ybbetter
Niggas is hating but this shit hard🔥🔥🔥
MAN!!!!!!!                DOWN!!!!!          😂💯
My guy knows how to market fs ❤
What happen to the being a Christ follower I expected this but was kinda thought I was see a change in the music
He wasn’t lying🤔
Love this song
This is the best rap song I’ve heard in a long while, RESPECT NLE 🙌🏽
Ngl the creativity and the symbolism is top tier. NLE is an artist .. 💯..
Bru using the Jive Turkey flow

Damn I can't lie I've never listened to a whole lot of nle shit but I gotta say this song was pretty fire even tho I do love young boy as well
I get it 💯
NLE Choppa, what do you do what NBA YoungBoy do?
He did a shoutout to Michael Jackson’s & pac
Ngl yo NLE went nuts on here yo this shit fye, whole choreography hard asb too, 5⭐'s from Baltimore!💯
Bro grew up ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾
This nih so sweet
Flood the comments YB BETTER ‼️‼️💯🥱
Say what you want to say about Nle but he's killing it with this banger
Yb don’t reply, please
Damn 😂 , is Kentrell going to respond to this , I doubt
🤦🏽‍♀️ everybody just lost out here.. either be a Deacon or a Rapper. So the concept im getting is clearly the whole world can see YB is at his highest peek and got the Spotlight in the music industry, and it’s evident you craving that Attention as well. I don’t think this video meets the perspective of being a Christian lol .. I believe you should look into/study Cosmic Law 📚 and you’ll understand that you’re doing the same Science  ,puttin out the same karmic energy that you rapping about against Nba Yb. … Google COSMIC LAW! Universal laws is what matter. Nobody is better than the Next, you’ll be ok.
Didn't he say free YoungBoy honestly nle is just looking clout and trying to stay relevant and first he was trying to be young boy now you wanna be Michael Jackson and Tupac like 🥷 pick one bro with yo bald headed ass 🙄
Who this kid this he is? Makaveli the Don?😂
Oh have I been sleeping on chopper???

Talent, creative 🎉🎉🎉
There was an R&B group called "The Boys" they have a song/video called "Crazy" same vibe.  NBA has either you or your production team on their last straw."
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
nle choppa is an amazing song and let me tell you something bro, the boy in your new song clip, the boy wearing Ethiopian military uniform, Jani, really made the clip beautiful. And Jani's country, Ethiopia, is the country where your new song was loved by the public. It's because of Jani who made the clip. Bro, make Jani your friend and it will benefit you, not hurt you. That's what I mean.
2:25 do not look like yb.😅
NBA youngboy still UNTOUCHABLE....!
That body tho 🔥 my godd
Thats a wayne baby( nle)😂😂😂😂 beefing with a tunchi baby ( yb) just keep on wax bc yall yns terrible😂😂😂

So, NLE what was the checker board floor for? Why did have it in at least every shot of the video? I have my own assumptions but I would like to hear his.
He thinks he's Tupac the cadence is the same
Your ass cook
Not a YB or NLE fan just a rap fan but I must say this isn’t a better message to the youth you’re portraying murder and rapping about being violent quite contradicting
Corny
Yb better
Never knew this generation rappers can rap like this . Great one
This young man just put the entire rap game on the hot seat. This was a prolific performance. Pretty much did what Drake and Kendrick couldn't do in their rap beef. Made a hit record, phenomenal video and executed it all excellenty. Dude is extremely talented and I'm just curious to see how the rest of these rappers respond.
Hot garbage 😂
The problem is like both choppa & young boy ,what we doing ?
At 54, I've seen millions of videos and this is the best. The rap/diss is great too.
Zesty cuh tweaking 🤣 NBA on Top the mount
Nle be artistic Yb making u do dumbshii
Thank you for pushing yb to drop some shotta vibe music soon! 🙏🏽🔥🦾
This creative, but he literally a fan and got the same image. They both just some rappers.
thank you for this trash ass music so yb can drop more heat
NBA YOUNGBOY BETTER THAN YOU
He made perfect timing 😂
brodie read "how to be kendrick, for dummies😭
NAAAW THIS AIN'T IT, IT'S STILL A BLACK MAN TEARING DIIINE ANOTHER BLACK MAN.

I think he got Tupac smiling 😂😂
2 mill in a day is crazy work
🔥🔥🔥🔥creativity on 10000% he’s HIM STOP PLAYING WITH HIS BODY MIND AND SOUL!!!!
I wasn't expecting that 😂🔥🔥🔥
What's the sample for this song?
Ngl I just like that the youth is helping to keep Tupacs name alive 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾🤣🤣🤣
I Love NLE. I don't know what's going on but I The dancing was on point! Video had a lot of creativity!
I love Choppa.  🔥🔥🔥
🇿🇦
This shit is trash smh
🔥🔥🔥 diss track

A south african flag
You sold your soul my boi
Respect. This one of the only grown man that’s not out here chasing after young boy. He ain’t lie everything he said was true he just the only one that wasn’t scared to say sum besides durk and Von
I SWEAR he used to dick ride yb but not he wants to diss????
Mission Accomplished... he officially pissed off the NBA gang... #somebodybouttodie
Shit dope
nga just wanna be Tupac now he a cornball yb goated
This bout to be the battle of the century!!! I root for NLE
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This video 🔥 😂
BLACK AND WHITE START INTRO THAN HES THROWING UP THE 6 👌🏾ALL WHILE DOING THIS ON A CHECKERBOARD DISPLAY DONT KNW WHO TO BELIEVE 😅😅😂
Fuck NLE Choppa the Fake Pac of our time  Dissing Greats looking for attention  We all know the Pac of our time *Lil Top* Fuck Choppa
Ok HE ON HIS 2PAC GRIND
This was a response to “know like I know”?
This is ass yb. don’t respond to this bs. He’s going thru his industry rituals rn just like the rest had to do.
Damn this shit is so good
👏👏👏👏👏
I don’t really get into the new school rap but this caught my attention. This was very creative and I have not saw this level of creativity in a minute . To be a diss track he gave us a good visual piece of art .
🔥🔥
I love the message,NBA young boy have one job and one job only is to keep the graveyards and jailed filled with people that look like him .
This shit 💩 garbage 🗑️
He sayin black folks used to look up to these people, the greats, who actually changed people views snd stood for sum but now niggas lookin up to people like yb, and dats a prolem.
2:18 this will fly over many ppl heads n they dgaf they just waiting on YB to drop a banger I already know how this yb fans moving
Both rappers are 🔥 but both have totally different persononas, nle is a creativity genius and Yb straight gangster and has the followers.  But personally I like Nle wayy better 👌🔥
Masterpiece
A bro put his all into this ish this YN beef rap hit different NLE was dancing his @$$ off too😂😂😂 he said I gotta be able to perform this one on stage Dot gave out the recipe 😂😂😂 now this is when it gets fun I just hope YB keep it hip hop he won't 😂😂 but I hope he do
NLE Zesty
This hard and creative  lol but we know yb gone come back wit some hot  I'm here for it 😂😂 NLE gave us a message what's nxt
He went Kendrick on YB while embodying MJ AND PAC 😂😩🤦🏾‍♀️ HIPHOP IS BACK!
Yb the goat 💚💚4kt
Now this is proof nba be minding his business and folks be fucking with him these nigga be straight hating but keep that energy when you see nba dumb ass
Bro moving his body too feminine
YBBETTER
THIS SHIT SUPER TRASH
2 millions in 1 day is crazy he was creative af nothing but message but Im just wondering what YB up too rn 🤣
Why the SA and UG Flag? ..... somethings brewing
🇿🇦🔥
The checkered board floor shows he sold his soul too. You can’t be industry & reveal the industry at the same time. Another Kendrick & drake story. It’s all staged.
Cinematic masterpiece
Clout chasing at it's finest, the nerd who came out trying to be a street rapper now wants to be himself cool. But don't say yb poisoning the youth when he's just upset his favorite serial killer king von was murdered. He didn't have a problem with von music. Just retire and go do comedy and acting 🎬
You got 2 million views off dissing yb congrats
NBA is the muse, we are the martyrs. NBA  might already be dead which is why its so easy for them to push a satanic agenda. Hes gone but here we are watching following. YNs walking in the shoes of a dead man. I cant imagine Kentrell, a child of God willingly pushing the messages he pushes. Kentrelle been dead & hes been taking us w him. This isnt a diss. Kentrell the hottest rn & who better to use, it got yalls attention. young boy isnt going up against the most high words or the ones who call him out. He’s not gonna respond to this🤷🏾‍♀️  Can we stop dissing NLE? From then til now its nothing but his testimony, the music industry dont gotta shut NLE down cause theyve conditioned yall enough to do it for them. Wake up🙄
#1 trending for music btw
This hip hop vs streets
Esta suave pero YB no va a responder, esa gonorrea no sabe tirar y el cacorro de Von bajo tierra.
😂😂 Low key fam snapped on this the video funny asf an creative gave me a Eminem vibe 🫡
G@e as hell. This lil weird dance video and childish kindergarten lyrics is why I don't even listen to new school rap anymore. Trash
Yb beter 😂
@janny 🇪🇹
Goat
I must be getting old because this sounds like garbage music to me.
Bro my,  2pac lucky dubd at the same time😭😭😭
Funny stuff😂
What’s the reason for this diss ?
Damn aye I fucks wit it
Good track bt not much of a diss
this is a 10/10. song 🔥🔥 video 🔥🔥
South Africa 🇿🇦Stand Up 2:09
Creativity is insane🔥
2:09 South African Flag 🇿🇦🔥🔥shout out NLE Choppa
His career is over good thing the video was good because the song was trash tbh
Brabooooo 🔥🚒
🇺🇬 enjoying it
Fire
This shyt is wack asf
Honestly this song 👎 the only thing good in creativity is the video. Stop it 🛑
Yo as a 32 yr old.....Ive heard disses from the old heads, like no vaseline ice cube, DOGG POUND, Krs1 etc. Boogie down productions..Biggie Pac...Drake, kendrick pusha T etc, and this is by far the most unique take on a diss..It simple lyrics, but the message, the Pac, and jackson innuendos, also it legit sounds like a Single release, Waited for YB to be Free to say anything...He knew what he was doing...I applaud that.
If Michael is still alive it gonna pay you over 100M to delete and never talk about these video🤯🔥
Best🎉
KO
Fr this is better than what Kendrick put out for drake artistry and all
This is pure garbage. Let not hype this man up. No bidy wants him to make more music like this.
I ain't gon lie this is dope
Thought you ate?? 😂😂😂 #ybdagoat💚
This ain’t it bro
2:08 Uganda 🇺🇬 😮
Just because it sounds commercial doesn't mean it ain't lethal, ts got me lookin at youngboy like he bouta be done
Gay
Bro took how long for this bullshit? He got this idea from his mama old ass.. when yb said shut up he did for a whole 2 years. Before that you was jacking von dick, not being from Chicago or BR but in some shit you had nothing to do with. Noooow you wanna boy sit thee fuck down!😂
Using another rapper name who you know could be as big as tupac just to pull views is crazy last time he even have more than 2M was 9 months. He knew to diss youngboy to save his career 🤷🏾‍♂️
👌👌👌
I CANT LIE THIS SH1T GETS BETTER WITH EVERY LISTEN 🔥💯😤 AND THE MEGA VISUAL KEEPS YOU COMING BACK 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️
He think he Muhammad ali Bruce lee Tupac Micheal Jackson lol
The visuals so creative! This was good!
Crazy publicity stunt bum
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥hes back
Fire
NLE is on a Seed Retention journey too. He’s war ready and FEARLESS 🔥
Keep it in mind this the same person that struggles to even pull at least 3 Mil views per video so he wanted to use clout knowing he would blow up if it was about youngboy. They will always speak about someone bigger than them to pull views when do y'all ever see Nle pull 2M views in a day?? Where am I lying?
Freemason checkerboard floor first thing you see
Its trash
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This shit gay
Ts look like a Kendrick diss music video😭
This isn't a diss tracks doing this because they don't have any likes, so no one listens to them. So they're just pretending to lose face.😅😂
Let's just hope and pray these young men keep it to the music.
That boy Ate😂😂🔥🔥💯
Clout chasing
I’m half the view count, to much to take in 😅😂
Not that it matters coming from me, but proud of you bro

Lol ts random af 😂
Why is bro having the south African flag all up in his vid now
Yeah this was a miss for sure, pudding pie.. less feminine energy and more hardness and this might have been a solid 4/10 rn it’s giving big failure..
Masonic thelemic shite.. And the kids are eating it up.  🙄
Vid is good But song is trash
k.o k.o
This is what you call a true piece of art all the time and effort he had to put into this video and the points that he's making in it are hilarious and those old enough to understand everything he's saying really understand how good of an artist he really is
Much needed innovation
YAHWEH IS THE ONLY WAY ‼️‼️🦍🦍
This shit ass and embarrassing. REAL ONES KNOW that NLE has a one sided beef w YB since like 2019 after YB said he don’t fw NLE… NLE got upset bc that was his favorite rapper at the time. Sure, YB really had no reason to say he didn’t fw him but at the time YB really didn’t fw ANY rappers around his age. Like, NLE even used to copy YB’s style and flow at times (yea cause I remember that one old song he made where in the beginning of the song he said “don dada… top shotta,” just as YB would say it, with that ‘Jamaican Talk’ flow… okkk, wanna be). But yeah, ever since, NLE has been butt hurt that his fav rapper didn’t like him… bc even this diss is random asf and mentions irrelevant, inaccurate things, he does not know what hes talking about. It’s honestly really for clout since NLE has been irrelevant all this time. He see that YB doing NUMBERSSS on his tours and just couldn’t accept that he’s doing well AND HAS BEEN since he was his fav rapper. Like what motivated this? Y’all niggas just can’t stand to see another nigga winning and gotta bring him down. Not to mention, all your lyrics here are BULLSHT and inaccurate asf, “I’m in love with the art, you tearing ppl apart”…. I’m sorry, YOURE in love with the art, YOU? Where have you been at all this time?? YB has been putting in work, rapping his ass off even while being black balled and on house arrest, now he’s out and doing big things on tours. But you… you’re 2 songs ahead from being considered a one hit wonder. Bitch Please. And the song ass and corny if I didn’t say it already.
YoungBoy gone get you
This dude so damn lame
He might be in da goat debate after dis one💯

I'm playing pass this, if I were YB. YB got 5 platinum records while on house arrest, no shows, no radio plays.
What did South Africa do?😭🇿🇦
🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
Not the....Meat to Meat Bul preaching! Fuck MJ gotta do with this fuckery?
before the 💩 jumps off let’s pop whoever owns the record label 1st before another black rapper dies or goes to prison!!! 🖕🏽🪬🫡
It's on God vs Evil 🔥

It took a nigga to diss yb to see all the haters he got most of y’all probably was at his shows screaming MASA!😂😂 choppa not fw yb in no catagory dis week ass diss
What does ummbootyeeeioooo mean ???
Boy this is a dumb ass song bro how you switch your focus and style to address another nigga you think young boy worried about you lil boy you out if fuckin line  bro who ever is guiding this dude is an idiot
SLIDE FOR VON❤️‍🔥
Best diss in 2025🤔
🏌‍♂️ .

He telling the truth yb poisons the youth anyone with a brain can see it🎉🎉
?
this ass
Bro today is his birthday..... happy birthday 🎂 🥳 🎉 🎈
Need some clout
Dude went from being a bad biii wanting to fuck his self to a gangster
Hopefully you listen
Confuse because king von was on the same thing you brag about him being really like that 😂
In I’m concerned for your safety you need to get a gun of some sorts. I love your music, but I’m telling you right now we cannot risk you can’t risk your life for any of this.
🏆 Respect
I like the concept but not the fact that you trying to attack nba youngboy dude has changed he creating a positive impact on other peop lives 🩵
This shiz ass
How is he exposing the industry when he’s dressing like a girl and on a black and white checkered floor ? Lol
Idc how good a diss is when the person is clout chasing clearly. Youngboy has 1 of the biggest hip hop tours ever. Stay focus YB and tell dude to worry about his bm on baddies 🤣
Killed himmmmmmm
High vibration music
This won’t end well
yb not responding ts 😂😂
This shit is ass YB is better😭🙏🏽
Boy u lame AF!!!
If NLE really feel like THIS, take a break from the music & get active in the community to help address & resolve the issues you claim YB has created &/or exacerbated. Satire ONLY goes so far💯
Finally, rap I can understand. Got tired of the slobbing rapping era. Creativity ❤❤❤
As someone who grew up in the golden era I'm gonna have to say this shit trash. But so is yb.
Perfection
Very very creative.  Very GENIUS
Yall weird but Nle slid 😂
lol this lowkey bopping
Zamn
😹😹😹
Kiab yall just don’t like who it is and who he dissing but this was hard😂
People can hate the diss and believe he's being hypocrite, as far as the god movement he been projecting last few years.  This dude is talented hands down, and he's different. Same as yb they have they own style and that's make them special. I myself relate more to NLE yet I'm a fan of both. NLE does not get the credit he deserves and maybe he not the best at club bangers songs, yet he's talented in undeniable as an artist. Brother got everything, take care of his health so the appeal is there, can rap, confident shows in his videos and for the most part stay out of trouble.
This is video of the year. Anyone that says different must think YB is God 😂
This Nigga Nle trying be on sum drake and Kendrick beef/diss type shi
NLE CHOPPA BRO UR COOKED 💀, it’s too early to lose ur life gng
FINALLY something that’s not copy paste. Bring back black art & creativity!!Visuals are fire 🔥
career suicide
Ngl dog this shit hard af
I would have understood NLE doing THIS diss if it was 2022 after "Know Like I Know." THIS is a water down version of "Hit 'Em Up." A sad impression of Tupac. RIP the legend💚
This is the dumbest shit I’ve ever watched, look what yb has done and your stupid ass is goofy as hell 😂NLE wanna pac so damn bad 😅embarrassing
😅😢
Did he go bald 🧑‍🦲
L’s in the chat
Much ❤️❤️ From 🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬 Africa
I can't understand him😂😂
Regardless if you felt it was a copy style/flow doesn’t discount the imagery and message. This is fire 🔥🫡
This lit
NLE's version of "Sad"
Hit em up sample is FIRE
Michael PAC Ali
Yb betta just sit this one out 😂😂😂
2pac would be proud
NLE him him with that 8 mile uno reverse card.. nba doesn't have anything to say or talk about but we shall wait and see!!
I LOVE THISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

Yea KO
Hrd I like him better than dude he don't want no smoke
Finally someone who didn’t disrespect PAC blood would approve this one
Fudge. This is so good when you KNOW hip hop.  When you know the west cost/east coast beef true cause was difference of opinion in what’s promoted. Feel how you want about cali but the government don’t control them and they don’t let liberal propaganda displace them from their community.  Yes. 99% of the gang members are clueless but there’s a 1% that understands the difference.  Yes he’s embodying Tupac and calling out parasitic behavior just like Tupac did the labels, managers, media.. he seen what they were about to do with hip hop the future generations.  Don’t believe me? Go listen to Makavelli: The 7 Day Theory.   Tupac depicting himself like Jesus (whom also was going at opps because he seen the same insidious nature.)  There’s layers. On layers.
Bro where is the old nle
KO THIS SHIT HARD💯🖤
Yb n the d to learn not to mess with  chopa
This is the best music video I’ve seen in a long time.
You Used To Look Up To Youngboy Now It's Beef You Wanna Make Diss Tracks Shit Is So  Trash

Youngboy gotta start his shit off like first off fuck you, 2pac Micheal Jackson and Ali nigga😂😂
3:04 😪👌
This was deep and very symbolic. I really appreciate the African unite scene
Two demons beefing with each other .. no one paying attention NLE A FREEMASON puppet too.. symbolism is showing in this video .. acting like 3 of free mason characters .. Michael Jackson “elites killed him”.. 2 pac “elites killed him”.. Mike Tyson  … dancing on a free mason checker board .. same checker board most of these artist have in their videos .. wearing all red. lol
Just wow👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

Shit feels like I’m watching high school musical
Nah he just buried yb with his own flow not to mention that that was one of the hardest track I ever heard in my life matter fact I’m a go ahead and said that is the hardest track
YB isn't talented enough for NLE.
This Kdot level video
NLE did what most these cats afraid to do... call out yb for how he using his influence. We got enough heat coming from other races, we need to heal and take out the trash that's preventing us from doing that. Support 💯
Idk
He said this for VON 😮
From 🇰🇪 kenya🔥🔥🔥
Word for word anybody ………. crickets
Yeeeeaa bro came hard with this junt 🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥
VIDEO OF THE YEAR . SUPER BOWL APPEARANCE 💚
He zesty for that shirt but he went over crazy
Black America will never allow other countries to use our creativity our music out of our DNA against us that's very disrespectful we know your creativity we know your music we got white supremacy using our own music trying to use our music against us so therefore the new name is wraps that want to be the original 💪🏾🇺🇸 rappers it's not good to disrespect the mothers and fathers of the original. chopper he cool with me. this is why it's important for black Americans to gatekeep. Does our creator our bloodline our music was never meant for entertainment true consciousness. Where is the American flag at in the video the Black American flag and this is not aimed at Choppa saying that the whole universe now I'm going to leave you alone let you do your thing and I like the video who say we don't have no culture when we influence all
Ts catchy af tho
KEEP IT RAP.. YOU KNOW HOW B.R CAN GET.. MAY THE BEST MAN WIN
NLEPAC

💩💩💩💩💩💩🤡🤡🤡🤡

Even as a yb fan can’t deny this is a great video and nle is talented asf. Also feel like nle is a better person 🤷‍♀️
I’m old head 46 and I’ve live through all the beefs and I can honestly say I’m not that familiar with both Artists work. But that might be the Greatest video Presentation of a Diss track I definitely understood the statement he was making.
All I gotta say is watch your back chop. They want you and they’ll get you.

Checkerboard tiles, should tell you what you need to know.
Only thing good about this was Tupac family got paid. 😅

Holy shit. He made a good song for once. More of this and you'll be alright!
He ain’t tell no lie in this song 🔥🔥🤷🏾‍♂️
This is terrible 😢
This was actually was actually GAY ASF!
I hope they do beef. Alot of y'all love NBA and I'll say I like NBA as a person. Not into his music I did try. But I'll say this song I can understand the words. NBA sometimes I'm like wtf he talking about due to how he rap. I'm not saying he trash because a lot of people love him. But I hope NBA does beef in a. Way to see his creative side because I believe he has one.
Lord, this world is coming to end everybody talking about the video but you’re not listening to the lyrics 🤦🏾‍♂️man we fighting spirits🤦🏾‍♂️
Checkered floor tells me everything I need to know….

THIS STRAIGHT UP TRASH!!!!
👀 NLE Choppa Verzuz NbaYoungboy #GunzDownMicsUp
YEAHHHH HE BACK
Fuck this sh*t 🔥🔥it slaps more harder  when yo see South Africa flag 🇿🇦
Ngl NLE went off on this one
I thought nle and youngboy wasn’t dissing anymore what did I miss
People talking like this was so creative when in reality he just tried to jack Tupac style and Michael J and disgraced them both all this gone do is get another artist that got to deep in his head killed
Had to watch this twice to see the message total 🔥
Well damn….. I wasn’t expecting this from NLE!!! That shit was dope!!
This is🔥🔥
He went in😂🫡🔥
He didn’t diss for nothing..yb did drop a diss to him first lol get back don’t have a date.
Will thank you now yb finna get ya ass 💕💕
Nah ts go crazyyyy
Its not enough
Ugandans 😂 where you
Bro this video 🔥🔥🔥🔥
this supposed to be the diss ¿
Must forgot nle was crip I feel it still💙
Like this if watched more than once
NLE is gonna win this battle IF Yb responds because what is he gonna rap about? Killing him? Get his folks to do it? It would prove NLE’s point even more..it’s the same ole poison that he’s been rapping about. Good and Creative Trap by NLE.
i think he is on a chess board for the floor thats why he says yb is the devils pawn and he is acting like Tupac because he remixed one of his music vids, saying yb is a devil worshipper. if u can find more tell me pls🙏🏽🙏🏽😭
Genius Master fn piece 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
Next guy dead wit some guy as moves 😭
@jahnny YAZEWWWWW🎉
Love the message that you gave , the creativity was 🔥, just wish you could’ve done it without using Youngboy’s name or dissing him . There’s been enough bloodshed amongst our people behind this music shit . Too many mothers has buried their sons , enough children growing up wo a father , too many innocent bystanders getting hurt . It’s too many more battles we need to be fighting right now !!!  Lord father , please don’t let this go any further .  🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Damnn bro is more talented than I thought
Ayeeeee Dummyyy Where The Fuckkk Did This Come From This Shit is Fuckinn Comeddyyyy. Im Crinee.

It's so weird hearing a rap song in 2025 that's over 4 minutes long. Multiple verses, a chorus, and hook that both are repeated. Y'know, like songs are supposed to be? 😂

Listen bro this Danjay ....bro you mocking 2 PAC style dats trash not your own fully truth is NBA YoungBoy is the one dat giving the world his heat dat is wat let you drop this track sounds desperate you bigger than this NLE...dat is it ...✊🤘🔋🇧🇿
Jesus is the ONLY Way to the Kingdom of God.   Accept Him as your Savior & Lord of your life, you won't regret. True peace and joy is found thru Him. None like making Jesus the Lord & Saviour of your life!
Stop copying other rappers before I get on your ass
The worst remake of PAC talks too 😂😂😂 F U NLE
This FN never had a Million Views til he mentioned NBA. Lmao
Damn this is lit
Lawd, what is NLE and Youngboy up to lol
Nah.
He did Chris brown 😂
He ain't no coward dissing YB tho. He waited until YB was not in jail or on papers so you can't say he's casting stones and hiding his hands
🔥🔥🔥🔥 my boy
Happy birthday choppa 😂
Curious to how many people skipped this ass song just to see the editing at the end
This is one of the best music videos I have seen in decades. Literally this is the type of music the game is missing!
Ds so ahh😂😂😂
Nah NLE is a literal legend for ts
wow
Is that a south African flag, at 2:01😂😂😂 at that soldier's uniform like why
Il veut buzzer sur le succès de @Youngboy 😅😅😅🤩frérot t’es cuit sans le feu 🔥 qui chauffe
This song is hot - he's going in.  Love the video creativity. The beat is tapping straight to my era and his flow is Tupac all day 🔥 ❤
🇺🇬Ugandan flag🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌🏽🙌🏽❤️
I never seen a battle rap wit this different. Y'all yn's different. And is this what y'all think Pac sounded like 😂😂😂😂.
Youngboy AIN'T coming back from this, 1M Views in less than a day 😂😂😂
All the haters in chat mad asl hahahahah😂😂😂😂😂😂
His creativity outweighs his music. It def keeps him afloat in the industry
Bro Nle just made that YB on tour and he going way more popular
This man snapped
🎵🎵"U fuck him dont fuck with me and thats just how that go"- NBA FUCK 🤏nle😂😂😂

This video will be remembered for generations
I don't know about this one but.....YB Don't play and he recently got free relax bro (Stop the Violence)
This song is raw….but I kept getting a Deja Vu feeling like I’ve heard the flow and the beat before. And then it hit me. Tupac - Hit em up inspired this. And this is before I watched video - I realized that.
My 🥷🏿 just talented thats all.
This shit assssss
I ffuckkkk with itttt ayeeeee no dislikes that what im taking about 🎉🎉
This shit hard AF 👌🙌
Checkard floor what a surprise
He posion the youth but u talking about shooting someone in the head ... no better
Micheal jackson+ tupac+ mohamad ali 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I feel like he should’ve baited him then used this as a response
Fire
NAH DATS HOW U GET OUT YA BODY!!! 😂😂😂
The paid actor gone katch hell when them yb fans katch em 😂😂😂
He slid on this
Fuck all that this shit hitting hard
Bro dying for attention 🤣🤣 he said nba youngboy was his favorite rapper and how he was influenced by him bro also drops music about shooting and killing other black men how does this make sense bro also flip flops between being vegan you can’t wanna preach to the youth while doing the same thing yourself this is obviously to get attention from nba youngboy NLE choppa daddy
Rip NLE THE GREAT  😢🥀💔 you just marked yourself as food for a few clicks and listens 😔 wasn’t the smartest move but hey definitely fw it 🔥🔥🔥
Jahnny from Ethiopia
3:43 Okay I hope this is him from now on.
The choreography. The growth.
Bro when he was wearing a wig it really made me see that bro can rock any hair style 😂
"When your fans become your haters."  - Eminem  I'm sorry but I just can't respect it. You modeled your name (even down to the syllables) and rap style after the guy now you're dissing him. In this video you're doing your best impression of Pac and MJ. So....... When you're not trying to be YB, MJ, and Pac when do you find time to just be yourself??? Who is that person? Do you even know? Smh... We only get one life here on earth. In this life, not everyone gets blessed with a public platform. If you do beat the odds and get one,  the least you can do, is try to be the main character of that. Not in the sense of making everything/the message about you, but meaning whatever you do put YOUR fingerprints on it. Smh. #NLEparakeet
Nba youngboy catching strays fr 😂😂
Lmao this ain’t nothing but the assistant kitchen manager telling you termination is forever on the table… matrix at its finest , don’t be gullible 🤣
Keep stepping on yb neck ❤
Solid track & a very creative music video
Somebody had to tell him he really is poisoning the youth and it’s so sad you got people in our community who wanna kill people just to kill.
Mann he went in
Lmfao the video tuff tho 😂😂😂😂 just cuz it’s a lot going on
Wannabe Tupac
Bruh nigga watching high as hell n honestly NLE did his shi im deadass in shock rn
Nigga talking 😭😭 literally
So you believe what he doing is wrong so u make a diss that would visibly stir sum and come apart of a problem you say is happening. Knowing who yb is know he could respond or even retaliate so essentially NLE is inciting  the violence 😂😂😂😂😂
It took him 3yrs to drop dis😂😂😂😂
I can't tell if he fr or trolling
He literally destroyed yb
This shit trash he don’t know wat he tryna do him and yk osiris jus need to stop is they related
How yall support this 😭😭 I thought choppa turned Christian, but he’s talking about violence and living in sin 😭 hell naw he just tryna become relevant again not to add having a decapated head is pushing violence
This mf pressure artistically
This shit gay asf
Idk how I feel about this 😂
i stand with nle, i dont like that demonic sht and how people dance at youngboys concerts, its evil and devilish sht they do its so cringe
I miss you why you didn’t post all day
Ik Yb Heard This By Now 😂😂😂 It’s About To B War .. I Ain’t Goin Lie This Was Very Entertaining
Dish rack😮😮
You know what's funniest about this video? The fact that he pays homage to Pac and Mike,  knowing that there has been an industry rumor for decades that Mike and Pac got into a fight over Quincy Jones' daughter and allegedly, Mike whipped Pac's ass. I only believe it because Joe was a boxing champion before he became paterfamilias of the greatest boy band in the world.
This is comical 😂 dam nba
tuffffff
Ts ahh🤦🏽‍♂️😂
That Tupac sample beat sounds fire and he lowkey put gang in his grave lmao
Shit about time. I always thought NLE was dope and I wondered what the fuck was wrong with that nba 💩 he killed this too.
YbBetter
Choppa you was just rapping about walking niggas down so I’m confused
Trash
NLE IS top 5 fashooo brother man never said a cus word the whole song

This shi is to assssss
Straight fire

Wait!! Did I just show S.A and Ugandan flag?❤❤
@SheilaDcomedy parody video brought me here 😂😂😂😂
A wise man once said “ All publicity is GOOD publicity” carry on Tupac mission 💯 they will understand later
Any Ugandans here 🇺🇬😂
The dancing doesn’t match the words. Tupac and Michael Jackson at once….
Hardest dis of the year awards
He snapped but why TF he dancing like he a barbie girl 😂
I think This nigga just started sum 😅
So bullshit.  You wait until he goes on tour to do this shit.  You lame for this bro
THIS WAS THE SHIT

Best video I’ve seen in a while! Song was fire too.
Ngl. This is fire. I we alot of shady/eminem doings
Views low rent due huh
yb still better in my opinion but like cna you really make a song talm guns to diss sum who talks about gun kinda hypocritical, but das js me. I mean listen to Finest by yb it seems to me that yall on the same path maybe nle a lil bit ahead but like nle finna start a war with this one mane.
This shit is trash
Bald fraud
They say you shouldn't argue with fools, because from a distance, you can't tell who's who...🎯
He needed dis to save his career
Clean up on aisle trey fr.
I’m proud of NLE Choppa for always evolving…. It’s not up to us what he looks and sounds like do your thing…. Be unapologetically yourself.
Besides all the jokes and shi ii been rockin wit nle no matter bruh give no fucks bout it , but cuh adlibs on this shi so hard😭

Gotta say this go hard!!!
So he tryna be the new Tory /Pac /and the nigga he dissing on one track? This lil boy confused 😂
This song sucks badly
RIP Choppa 🕊
He don’t even sound serious 🤏
Bro was Michael jackson Mohamad Ali and a bit of Mike Tyson while  dissing YB. Bro woke up and chose violence
2 million views in a day 😂😂😂 YoungBoy could never
My brother said he gay and I believe it now look how he move yb not worried about him
As a fan I can’t glaze this it hypocrisy at its best and this is a terrible fuckin song, easily the worst nle choppa song went from teenager with guns to Tupac reincarnation he not actually dissing I hope youngboy stay outta this one. It not even worth a response this shit like the cinematography is a fuckin joke
Poisoning the youth? Look at the floors! Look at all the demonic shit they got u doing u not even respected for this bs
Yazewwwwwww
This shit hard
Yazewwwwwwwwww
What yb do
NLE snapped. Good video
Major Payne lookin ahh
This is probably his last video. I know young boy already making calls.
Mixed feelings.. The video was absolutely incredible in all aspects but the bars didn't do anything for me honestly.. The rap was sort of elementary
ts is ass what was the point of this
Ight now when yb see you and slap fye out yo dumb ass. You gone be wondering why
This is better then anything yb ever made
He jacked the zeddy beat
NBA youngboy what u think on this
Heavenly father i pray you keep this man safe at all cost
Doing this on black n white tiled floors..nle knowing fr. This shit really crazy
NLE really dug in his bag for this and I don't even really listen to bro like that.
*_Rest in peace pac_*
This shit really that dope some of y’all are too young for this breakdown but to a Tupac beat iykyk 🔥
This song is so TRASH 🗑️ HOW YOU DISS A RAPPER AND YOU HIS MINNIE ME 😂😂😂😂
Yb finna get yo ass
This is rather wack.... if you can't do better than the original, you need another beat. ... Hollywood belongs to Satan,PERIOD !!!!!!
yb has admitted to his wrong doing with his music and how it brings him pain tho i see what ur saying tho he still don’t do nothing to show hes sorry
So what do we do with this?
this shit hard don't get me wrong but youngboy is finna end this man's whole career
That was SOOO GOODD
Tufff 🔥🔥
BEFF🫥🫣🥱😮‍💨
Nle Choppa has been possessed by spirit of 2pac at this level he can diss the whole world 🌍😂🔥
I was waiting for the beat to switch up and drop, to a more heavy hitting Bass pounding triple snare drum Memphis type beat. 😅 But this was something new and creative from NLE choppa 💪💯
“ *How About Noooooooo* “  ~ *Dr Evil*
YOU ARE HIM bruh
2Pac+MJ
Have to admit nle talent on god
Hit' em up type beat 🔥
Love this so much ❤❤❤
You should be ashamed of yourself for this Bullsh*t

NLE LAME I SWEAR N HE CANT EVEN RYHM FRL N Y HE DISSIN YB ACTIN LIKE HE WONT BYA 🤣on 4KT jst cant wait till yb bya
I think its the war of the soldiers…the demon sent us his best soldier and god sent us his. If he has to kill the demon seed then so be it thats where i think the gun bars come to play i think its symbolic of a soldier of the lord killing the soldier of the devil. Could be a reach but i have reasons
Bro got it
What a beautiful soul 💛
“when i do its different, when he do its ignorant, im in love with the art, he tearing people apart.” oh lawd what have u done nle
yb goin kick his ass

Your A freemason at this nle choppa. You were helping the devil torture symbolic nba and dancing on the Masonic checkerboard. You music ain't positive either. Your poisoning the youth equally as NBA. This is the "him" effect. Everyone demonic
Who singing this shyt faithfully word for word please let me know cuz that’s entertaining and this boy ain’t had a show in how long
NBA YoungBoy is pawn used by the devil leading people to hell and if you don’t see that, you’re probably on your way all price to the most high
Yall don’t even hear him Saying Yahweh at the start of the video!!! NLE!!!
Video goes insane. So good
Nba do be talking crazy about hitting black woman and influencing black on black crime..!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yoo is this bout young boy or is he rapping bout himself? I'm confused by the hypocrisy
He deffo got paid a fat bag to do this lmfao
This seems like an attention grab go off your own wave NBA been on his own time.
I mean YB did say HIMSELF, that his music was demonic and the industry is demonic! I understand nle Choppa might not be the best deliver, but somebody from yb’s same struggle needed to say it. Some of these rappers feel the same about shit, but their contracts want them to put out violence to our youth, and that’s how they get paid. When people start realizing that, and leave this money alone these kids will stop their shenanigans. We just gotta wake up, because yb’s whole tour theme is Taking Y’all To HELL, and it’s crazy after the first concert he’s still sold out, smh. We all sheep in a certain way, but damn y’all. Lucifer was the angel of music!
Zesty asf
Dude thought he was doing something with this garbage. If he cared about the youth and the violence music promotes he would have taken down all his most popular songs, he also would not be swearing and throwing up gang signs and fake shooting in his music videos😂😂😂😂
ts buns yb better
Real shit im 43 i respect it 4sho 😂
He thinking out the box
Ngl nle im not listening to yo music no more bruh

Clout chaser 🤦🏻‍♀️
The great divide is happening between those are in an upward walk to the light, and those who are walking deeper in darkness.  I pray he gets higher into the mind of Christ, to fight the enemy that stands in his way in Jesus mighty name. I decree and declare 2 Timothy 1:7 “For we’re not given a spirit of fear but Power Love and a Sound mind Jesus Amen.

LEAVE AFRICA OUT OF THIS BOY🌍
I love you man but young boy is very dangerous with words
Rage against the machine! I applaud this brotha for seizing the opportunity to draw a line in the sand. No lies detected. I pray it stays musical and sparks an awareness...
Wow😮❤
Now we wait… for YB
Nigga knew he was falling off and saw that youngboy been doing tours and is #1 so ofc he had to get is lil diss in 😹

respectfully, you can tell he put his whole ass into making this and it’s so refreshing to see creativity like this ❤
Today is nle birthday
This is the most creative video ever
why does it have 2pac vibe?
Ehhhhhhh, gimmicky. Not really a good song. Not a fan of the inauthenticity, then the choreography made it a bit much. But I mean I guess he executed a clout pull pretty well
Idc bout him and no other man’s beef - ain’t none of dez 🥷’s putting food on my table so Dey beef is Dey beef… but this song/video is definitely real art. I give it a 10 out of 10….🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯
He popped out like Ken years later but definitely hard
Lamest Shit I've ever seen💯🤡
Yb might want to go strategize for a minute
Hate it or love the song slaps 😂😂😂
Shit trash
King did his thing!!!! 🔥 🔥 The message was accurate it was positive and very creative. The choreography was fire the music is 🔥. He should win an award for this for sure.
NAHHHHH😂😂
Just like kendrick's❤❤❤😮😮😮
Never listened to a Choppa song but this right here is fiya.  Excellent video concept.

Shit weak
Damn NLE is changing the game
What is Uganda 🇺🇬 doing here
The Masonic checkerboard floor, also known as the Mosaic Pavement, symbolizes the duality of human life and the constant interplay between opposing forces like good and evil, or knowledge and ignorance.   Hope it ain't going over yall head folks.
Yo ass is good thank you I hate youngboy prt 2 comin

🚮 ...
You know i did really like old choppa, but honestly I really like this choppa, I just think he needa chill on the michael jackson moves but yeah, this is fire bro
Yb what dis the big boy league 😂😂😂
He is the better rapper out of the two but we still love NBA But NLE song is 🔥
song ass and NLE fruity
🤯🤯
This shit whack asf😂
I'm confused how people saying they don't like this it's creative and got a message to it to for yall to not like this but was riding the wave of not like us where Kendrick was dancing and was doing the hop scotch and calling a man a 69 god yall swore it was 🔥 and that song ain't nowhere near better than this
He ate and it was funny 😂
Pac and big vibes 💯
This was actually good
🤣🤣🤣
Reminds me of what Luda use to give us in the early 2000s. Keep standing out and being a leader NLE!
That’s track sound good.  Butt you a hatter
Music is cooked
May god bless nle
This go hard, but for some reason, I thought Lil Nas X was  going to pop out 😆.
Lord you finna die fhoo🤣🤣🤣
NLE want all the smoke. And I’m here for it. NBA 24hrs??????
He did his shit on this one for real
One thing he anit NBA Youngboy no more he Top 😂
The song the shit I’m not gonna lie but it’s dark to especially the end running wit a head devil shit what message and light you presenting here the video a little dark
I’m not even on this side of music anymore and I had to comment like foreal. There’s so many layers if you want to talk about it. Every word and scene in the video was calculated. When I saw a clip of yb at one of his recent shows they were on him like freaking Michael. Who did NLE imitate the most in the visual??? Yes he was saying he’s the updated reason the youth are wilding right now. I can rap, sing, dance, fight, shoot and look better than you. Notice the threatening lyrics? Who raps like that?? This whole thing was a Mirror for YB but on steroids.
I wonder if the label told him to do this
Yazew❤❤
Here before 713k
Highly confused
😢YB better
He say something
This song is low-key trash
That's wat u call talent

Powerful message. I respect the journey NLE been on, I'm not a music fan of his, but his growth as a person has been admirable tho. This was a breath of fresh air for someone who loves true hip-hop.
Very creative
I think man is look for clout for all nba done ngg don’t know yn don’t play he want to be toc pac he finna end like him too watch

Blow yo head off your neck like a dandelion 😬😬😬

Wait I’m confused…. He talking about nba poisoning the youth. About guns and drugs. But in the same song talking about guns and how he can do better and also about blowing his head off…. He sounds like he just wanna be like him.
He sicked a god on yb YH WH YH WH-marduk
Beef?
Damm🔥🔥🔥🔥

Only reason ts getting views cause he cutting yb head off and it's crazy how he came out of nowhere with as soon as yb start saying how much he trying to change it's like he trying to pull him down I don't respect that I just hope he find himself
Didn’t have this on my bingo card, but here we are…
People are saying NLE Choppa is just hating on YoungBoy, even though YoungBoy made it on his own and built his own success. And you know what? You’re right—he might be hating, or he might not. I’ll even say this: NBA YoungBoy is a good and talented artist. But here’s the thing—he could do so much more with his music. He just got out of jail, he’s been pardoned by the president, and he’s been given another chance at life. That’s the perfect moment to flip the script, change the message, and inspire people to do better instead of promoting violence.  To explain what I mean, imagine this scenario: there are two people. One of them is running a flashy hustle that gets a lot of attention—people love the style, the energy, the image. The other person is building a real business the right way, with patience, discipline, and integrity. Both are successful, but in different ways. Of course, the one doing things the right way might feel some type of way seeing the other blow up faster through shortcuts or negativity. But at the end of the day, one path builds something solid and lasting, while the other risks falling apart.  That’s how I see the difference. Choppa isn’t just throwing shade—he’s pointing out that music has power. If YoungBoy used his talent to inspire growth instead of fueling aggression, he could change lives. And in his song KO, Choppa showed that by honoring Michael Jackson, Martin Luther King Jr., the history of slavery, and Black culture, while reminding people that life isn’t only about violence. It’s about growth, change, and becoming something better.  That’s the bigger picture people are missing.  And before anyone tries to twist this, let me be clear: yes, I did use AI to write this paragraph—but I used it with my own thoughts. I wrote the ideas myself and just had AI polish them. It didn’t think for me, it didn’t create my perspective—it’s simply a tool, the same way you’d use spellcheck, a calculator, or even social media itself. It’s called common sense: using the tools available to make your message stronger.
Okay so he came out that he is gay half of this thing if you read it correctly it says that he's gay
NGL this shit is really Art 🖼️
Been playing a lot of their old NLE this shit right here fire yng boy  definitely ain’t going outside today
Buddy deletes all the comments mentioning how cringe this is lol

All glory to Yaweh and Yeshua aka Jehovah God and Jesus Christ.. we saved not soft and WE DO NOT FUCK WIT NBA YOUNG BOY OR ANY DEVIL WORSHIPPING ARTIST PUSHIN DAT BULLSHIT

Can’t even take someone like YB serious anymore after being called out like this ….. he promotes loser activities and a loser mentality. You have to have shit for brains to even look up to him to begin with.

That weak afffffffffffff he lame as hell
we would be lying if we said this wasn't Hard Ngl 😂🔥🔥🔥 and only a ignorant person Can't understand the message of this song
His overly expressive personality and willingness to constantly showcase all of his inner scattered thoughts and emotions is what keeps him relevant…Those tendencies alone can make mediocre talent stand out so kudos to his formula 👌
DAX must’ve been the creative director of this 😂

"I ain't beefin with all these niggas dont even mention me...they gon kill me if they can, no need for dissing come get rid of me" - top
And what is SA and Ugandan flags doing in Ring😂
This is the biggest crash out is yall serious  lololol who sensed him lil  durk  🤣😭🤣😭🤣😭💀
I think people don't truly understand what NLE is conveying with this song.   If you notice NLE only used imagery from the "Golden Age" of black entertainment people like Prince, Michael Jackson, Ali, Pac, New Jack City, and Roots  He's calling YB a demon that's corrupting the youth and subsequently corrupting black culture, while he's singling YB out he's mainly doing so because he himself was a YB fan and blames him as the source of the corruption that made him act the way he did before he found Christ.   He's calling YB a hypocrite and that he tried to make peace with him originally which he instead used to further his own "crash out" image.   NLE is saying he would rather see YB dead/kill him before he sees the cycle that is the rao industry plant it's seed for another generation of corrupted black youth.
Garbage
Let me cook.
ጃኒን አላየሁትም😂
We Brazilians like Youngboy, screw that guy.😂😂😂😂

Bout dam time someone calls him out

Ok this kid is a true performer 😂
The song is fire but what he saying about young boy he already said about himself ngl
Wow
FREE SMURK🔥🔥🔥💯
Everyone knows that whenever a rapper is becoming irrelevant they try to get attention again by dissing someone who is actually making continuous hits in the music industry this is a cry for attention and to add I just looked up this “wrapper” (spelled intentionally) that song “walk em down” is about killing and selling dope til the sun comes down 🤣 don’t try to talk down on someone else art when you doing the same thing the only difference is YB actually lived through that so he’s transforming his pain and anger into his music to express himself
Yb finna tear him a new asshole
😂😂😂😂 boi you soft and you gay nothing trill about you boi

Tbh i get it.  I respect this its just that im a different yb supporter. I like all the music he makes that is emotional,  that comes from the heart , alot of music mainstream doesn't even care about.  I actually gravitate to the yb behind the chain and behind the strings. Everything isn't on him.  Its on parents and communities too. Its a pov here no light is shed on.  But i respect this and im not a basher. Im Just still spiritually W yb. 💯 i pray for him.
You been doing great NBA young boy.. don't let this man get you out your character.. he tryna get you to crash out.. and top this shit mudslid ass

Songs ok but what’s with the dissing? Didn’t know he had an issue with nba. And why diss an artist who is way bigger and better? The music today last for like 3 weeks when I’m still listening to music and albums from the 80s 90s and 2000s. I miss when music use to touch your soul now it’s all about viral moments that won’t last I wish this new generation will start to make the music touch your soul again

He should have kept the pac style flow off this one. It would have been bigger than Kendrick's diss track if he used his own style.
What did Uganda do
Nigga came out of nowhere wit all that hating ass shit let nba have his moment
They gon say this zesty but honestly we need some creativity in music videos and stuff again I think this woulda did better not as a diss
Am leaving evidence

Is he still a 60, I’m lost
I thought he was lame but coming from Houston as a Mexican living in a hood where NBA YOUNG BOY Has all the kids brainwashed . Amen for this man speaking his mind.
If Tupac was alive he will probably make a song with NLE

This shi is HOT GARBAGE 3:12
Checkboard floors.... This ain't no battle, this is another illuminati ritual 2 keep people distracted just like Drake and Kendrick did and make money off the naive people who don't know the difference. Demonic rituals hidden in plain sight. We tired of ALL OF Y'ALL. It's time 4 a change! 😤😤
Anyone see the Ugandan flag😂
Cuz lost his mind
Why is the south African flag there
I know yb laughing at this 😂 😂😂
u not tupac
Now why would you bring this energy towards you that's about to come...... I hope this doesn't end badly.
This young man has clearly lost his self way more than yb. This is clearly for clout and the same time promoting what you say your going against. NLE is jealous and lost
This is like a 2pac vibe honestly it’s 🔥
One day he spiritual next day he gangsta now he Tupac
Wow 😮

2:45 it’s for thriller
I guess choppa is a little jealous after seeing how nba yb sells out arena’s and wants to claim yb affects young kids 😂😂
Shout out to SOUTH African flag 🙌 👏 🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
Definitely eye catching. A nice break from the usual rap videos of today. A bit hypocritical though. Interesting.
Homie wanna be like everyone except his self 😂😂😂 man sit yo milk dud head ass down

I personally want YB to respond…not how he usually disses. Something that shows GROWTH
😱
NLE Choppa’s “KO” isn’t just a song it’s a statement. The creativity, the visuals, the message—it all hits different. This isn’t your typical rap track. It’s layered with meaning, calling out what’s wrong in the culture while standing tall for something real.  From the bold imagery to the unapologetic lyrics, Choppa is speaking truth that cuts deep. He’s not just entertaining—he’s educating, challenging, and inspiring.  This is what happens when an artist uses their voice with purpose. “KO” is raw, fearless, and full of intention. It’s a reminder that music can still carry weight, spark thought, and push the culture forward.  Real recognize real—and this one? It’s greatness in motion.
Thank you for dropping this Ahhh song yb bout to drop a banger😭🙏
I can’t Stop playing this 🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Daaamn what's that Ugandan flag doing there 😂😂😂😂

The people choose yb and called him the new pac, the people called youngboy this generations Michael Jackson, then NLE chopper desides himself to play dress up and diss, NLE the biggest clout chaser and fake actor NLE litterally talking about himself in this song
I'm confused why are they beefing...or why did Choppa made a diss song to YB
I like this shit…. ❤
There’s no come back after that even if you drop a banger the message of this diss is still deep . Good job choppa 💪🏾💪🏾💯
So much Creativity And Top tear word play ..I see that death row chain
Songs whacker then whack 100 dude this ain't it you sound like your hurt little buddy did YB hurt you this bad. Therapy is the solution and this isn't therapy you're embarrassing yourself while in a psychosis
This is wack. But I guess to some its art. Everyone has their opinion.
Ionk if yb coming back from this 😭😭😭
Checker designed floor? Hmmm…
very creative great performance
This was CREATIVITY! YNS THIS WAS INNOVATIVE! He ADDRESSED A FEW THINGS! LIKE ROC NATION AND THE DEMONIC CONTROL OVER THE INDUSTRY!  While also paying homage! This was POWERFUL BIG SCORPIO!!!!
Everybody involved in the makin of this zesty bufoonery should be deported to the slums of Mars

Lamest Diss Of All Time
I made a comment before I saw the vid. 10/10 giving me old busta missy vibes.. just the vid not the lyrics lol. This vid this very well directed!
Took me a minute, the industry want him to do this, he faked bro nothing real about nle Choppa. Straight up industry plant
Yuh
This dude thinks he is tuepac
VERY CREATIVE!!
I think he got another hit with this and him and youngboy beef might have some bangers
bro took 3 years to diss back😭
I cannot take this song seriously. NLE and Young Boy are both shit stains to society. Both promote getting activity and violence. Also for him to make the quote in this song how young boy isn't doing anything good for the youth so are you my guy. You're promoting violence in this video while dissing someone else who you claim isn't doing anything good for the youth. You're both pathetic
I’m gonna cap this shit is fire
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Any Uganda here😂😂😂
Shit trash
Yb responded 🔥 https://youtu.be/bHR_YN9kdsM?si=rl4dzGiA9DIGhwbi

He stole that this is ya king bar from tay roc and he’s talking about exactly what he’s judging if you say this is artistic or creative in any way you’re what’s wrong w the rap game
Nle clears yb at least you can actually hear what Nle say instead of yb you have to look up his lyrics
He snapped… but … did I see a black blouse with lace sleeves!?
Now if yb reply you know that’s yo ass boy this was entertaining tho🥱🔥

Loved the creativity and still is hip-hop this is what it’s all about . The music, this was hard, was never a big fan of both but this is definitely 🔥. If you get on a legendary pac beat like this , you gotta bring it ! And NLE definitely did. Salute king 🫡. Gained a new listener. Love this Iconic imagery and homage and artistry 💯
Finally nLe.... Let him know what's up
It take a million dollar video to diss yb this nigga 😮
Ngl, there was truth and a message here. And you explained yourself🤝❤️ Keep being you NLE. God Bless🙏

God i ask u to protect nle for making this  amen
Damn nle
I don’t NLe Choppa wrote this but he ate him up on this
😂 he killed it 🔥
Creativity is great but the choreography is killing me😭
NLE is a man with many talents 👏🏿 👏🏿💯
I came to clown I ain’t gon lie …. 🥷 got a new fan took a risk and I think he won
His Illuminati backstory seems alarming
❤️‍🔥
Him releasing this dark twisted music video on Halloween was pure Genius. I have no complaints. 😂
ts so ahh😂✌️✌️
NLE ON TOP. 🔥👏🏽
He knows that he has a lot to stand for and people that are looking up to him hero wise, but what does NBA do nothing all he does is continuously talk about detriment in our minority community with no results he believed that putting together a fucking soup kitchen can help people just like the rest of the idiots that came before our time God this is amazing and funny as hell. 😂 the triple six shall show you all it’s true endeavors instead of the lies. This is the age of the Aquarius/knowledge truth, wisdom/revenge.
It’s serious but the moves is questionable
Both artists have made songs that we all can say are not meant for the youth, but if we keep it a buck, you can’t blame one artist for poisoning the youth when you had contributed to the problem
Bro lame af for this trying to get clot off Youngboy cause he up right now
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It’s 🔥 and funny af but it’s like the elbow calling the knee ashy,the 🥷🏾 name is literally NLE Choppa😂😂
Ngl I came to hate and I COULDN'T! 😂
Maybe this song can now teach you 2000 babies on how to be far more creative instead of mumbling follow your leader/master Choppa and learn how to use bigger words now y’all yay!!!🙏🥰😱
This shit is fruity af.
Dope!!! 😂😂😂❤❤❤❤

No way he just moon walked on young boy
I like the old nba youngboy when he was going threw real pain and struggle ion like this new nba youngboy frfr…im feeling this song though he’s not speaking nothing wrong at all. It’s the truth. He’s just aiming at youngboy cause he have a bigger platform than any other rapper rn

Yeah that shit was hard tbh and I don’t even like him bhro telling the world he the king
"When I do it its different, when he do it its ignorant" 😂😂😂  "Sending niggas on drills he wouldn't even do"😂😂😂😂  NLE Cooking🔥
Brainwashed Yb fans hating hard right now 😂
The song is hard . But it’s contradictory tho.
He needs to figure out if he likes or hates yb. Guy switches up all the time
Ok yeah he went ham but you think nba finna take it serious. Like he on a 100 million dollar tour, while it seems like nle just clout chasing and taking advantage to get some light. This would have been better without a video because all this dancing homie is doing is not gonna be taken serious. Also this seems like it's coming from a place in nle's heart from his love for von. Like this the get back or something. But I seriously doubt youngboy will respond. And if he do he will destroy nle. I'm just saying.
So basically NLE want problems 😅😂
I dont listen to much rap but I've listened to this song over a dozen times today!!!! Super creative song video is probably more creative
Move aroun wit da “lowkey good” stuff , yawl know damn well dis song harder than anything yb can respond wit🤣🔥like he ain’t gon give yawl da same flow over n over ,dis real music w a actual message pple need to hear🗣️

This is ART, there's 0 room for debate! Shoutout to the Creative Director & Choreographer. The message is clear, "If you cross that line don't step any further!" Even in the bible it speaks on not idolizing man, but God only. Folks worshipping certain celebrities must pick a side because there's consequences. In other words, stand on business. This song is iconic for both the culture & the sake of reviving artistry in today's music. The undertones of much of this generation's music is counterproductive &  backwards to the work that our Ancestors fought for to push forward past the obstacles we've already overcome. NLE is brave for this to express this sentiment in his music, as its frowned upon from major labels that are unable to capitalize off of it since it doesn't contribute to further pushing against the agenda of promoting ignorance to ultimately destroy a group of people that they "claim" to hate yet watch & study just to copy. It also exposes them. This is gonna ruffle some feathers! Conversations will be had. I'm here for it 👏 I commend NLE Choppa for him taking it up a notch because he had a 💪  presentation ...... Shots fired 🔫  BOW BOW BOW #LevelUp #YoungBoyWhatThisTheBigBoyLeague #KO
I dont even listen to NLE but ig brought me here. He was MJ, Tyson, Pac, and man bro snapped 👏🏽
Azz
I wasted 4 mins of my life listening to this bs
I ain't gon lie, I came here to hate bc I do like YB, but I'm walking away with a new respect for NLE.   This was a creative piece that had a message and really showed that NLE has a helluva range as an artist❤
That's a good song , i lick it 👍🏻
nle kill that shit
I done learned the whole song 😂❤
Yes bro You were later for this but finally ❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
NLE did his thing with this lol yesss!!! Is this really him moving like that or AI mixed in bc it is FYE 🔥
Don’t be screaming all that peace sh*t and vegan 🌱 sh*t when yb put belt to ass
Man wanna be Tupac so BAD the disrespect is enough smfh Tupac would never w you

My lil bro, my first best friend is in jail right now for listening to him I legit saw him morph into another person, emulating him. Amongst other rappers but YB is his fave one. Every word in this song is how I  wish I could get thru to him. I am so happy he did this. My lil bro could moonwalk, sing, he was very good at sports just so talented and he gave it all up succumbing to his inner dinners. ❤if needed to be addressed.
ts ass
This is fire 🔥

Had to run it back a couple times to make sure I didn't miss nothing.  Shout out to NLE for fire visuals, lyrics, creativity, and a on time trick and treat!! 🔥🔥

This the big boy league I put one up in your gut under the Jesus piece Last thing that I heard was "Jesus, please" Had me looking at the Devil like "This is your king?" Ain't no fun, when the rabbit got the gun, you run You just a pawn on the Devil chessboard, you done I'm trying to step some, bless some, wet one, stretch one What you can do, I can do better R.I.P. y'all altogether, all black in some leather I eat bullets and shit Berettas, rival with my Chiappa Winchester Bet yo' bottom dollar Top Shotta packin' heat Iron Mike, Cus D'Amato, I'll put a nigga to sleep We can bang this shit out for all the real niggas The house and the field niggas, I'm trill, nigga I rock nations, "Still nigga" Cut the head off the snake when I deal with 'em So it's on like Scarface, Al Capone Lucky Luciano, Don Vito Corleone And I'll bury all you cockroaches, where? In ya' homes, the catacombs Store the bones, I'ma leave smoking When the smoke clear, cry smoke of tears "It's Hunting Season" on the "Wall of Weird," head hunting souvenirs [Chorus] K-O, K-O Hmm, voo-D-I-O Yahweh bomba ye (If you cross that line) Don't step any further (Don't you step any further, nigga) K-O  [Verse 2] Purple reign, I'm strapped with two Glocks on me, twin flames Tryna bring a demon pain, I'm losing sane I got a bullet, engraved on it his name Clip like a dick, dump it 'til it's all gone, that's a sex change This shit get deeper than rap, can give a fuck 'bout the streets Yahweh sent me to decease 'em so I'm the reaper to greet 'em Andele, bombs away, down go the four Ten was the count (Nigga), but he don't want no mo' Let's see who macho for real Lock me in a room with you, I'll make ya pipsqueak squeal from his grill I'm gonna cock and let you taste the iron Blow your head off your neck like a dandelion, come on Bitch boy, sugar honey iced tea He a he-she man, brah, I'll put them lead carrots in yo' ass Now you're wearin' a colostomy bag for a pamper I'm cancer, I'm tryna cancel 'em  [Chorus] K-O (Man), K-O (Down) Hmm, voo-D-I-O (Clean up on aisle Tre, nigga) Yahweh bomba ye (If you cross that line) Don't step any further (Don't step any further, nigga) [Verse 3] You poison the youth, nothin' positive you do You the reason niggas beating bitches thinking that it's cute You send niggas to do what you wouldn't even do Role model, you will never fit the shoe, mm Just a nigga with emotion, a breastfed bitch Your aura give me the ick, niggas like you make me sick Money, power, guns, and a few drugged-out crash outs Make you think you the one who can lash out Fuck benefit of doubt, we all tryna make it out Tried to peace it up with ya, you the one that wanted clout Holding onto a image that you ain't really living Everybody that you rep on, I know who really did it, uh Can you feel it? The reaper want a visit Judgement Day around the corner, the Creator livid Purposely making decisions to promote mo' violence That's bringing mo' death unto his innocent children When I do it, it's different, when he do it, it's ignorant I'm in love with the art, he tearing people apart Embrace my light and my dark, why he ain't doing his part? Why he ain't doing his part? Why he ain't doing his part?  [Chorus] K-O (Man), K-O (Down) Hmm, voo-D-I-O (Clean up on aisle Tre, nigga) Ye (If you cross that line) Don't step any further (Don't you step any further, nigga, bow-bow) K-O (Man), K-O (Down) Hmm, voo-D-I-O (Clean up on aisle Tre, nigga) Yahweh bomba ye (If you cross that line) Don't step any further (Bow-bow-bow)  (Any further)

He need to have that same energy the whole time because this gone be a back in fornt rap beef so all his diss got to have this energy
This looks ridiculous. I left as soon as the ridiculous dancing started and the ridiculous flow started. 5 thumbs down 👎

Great diss song for NBA Youngboy
90’s rap still alive, the reference of the iconic clip diss from eazy e showing a person that’s represent dr.dre.🤌🏾😂2pac’s attitude, yep…
❤❤❤
Insane 🔥🔥
this was smart but why tho ????
This is fucking awful. That was the worst fucking song I've heard in a long time. And I ain't even a YB fan at all. I don't listen to YB not one bit but this diss track was fucking garbage. What's up with that hook? That fucking chorus gave me an ear ache. This bullshit better not get stuck in my head for the rest of the day. Imagine being in a torture room strapped to a chair wearing a straight jacket with   this song on repeat. But the over all message hes trying to convey or get across I agree with because I do think alot of these YN's are ready to crash out over YB and throw they whole lives away because they think living that lifestyle is cool.. he definitely does poison the youth in my opinion but  dudes corny for this because he used to be YBs biggest fan at one point ?? This shit is just too lame fr
🇿🇦🇿🇦
He might come along way. But I still see the same ignorant piece of ishhh that got kicked outta uber for mocking his middle eastern driver culture n dialect
Mzansi let's gather here 🇿🇦
Gay

Bro been rapping since a kid his mom dad paid for his studio time his first hit was about gangster shit this is embarrassing nle went from tryna get the streets then he went tryna get the LGBTQ audience then he went soul searching then he questioned god bro can not keep his fans satisfied
For him to get the green light to use pac beat y'all already know NLE war ready
he killed it.
Nba young boy faker than drake😂😂
Tell you what nobody saying this 💩 w4w
they ALL missed the "Tory Lanez boxing the Devil", "Rocnation Stealing niggas", "cut the head off the snake", Reference
They said NBA Was the next Michael I think that’s why be fr yall watch the video why would he do Michael 😂
Yb finna do thus boyy sumthin nasty when he snap back just watch 💯💚
Ts ass
Finally some real music
ts so ssa  and not js saying it cuz its abt yb 😂df he tb
Yo he rapping to fast and his lyrics are to gangster for the feminine outfit he is wearing at the beginning I would have had the director to cut that out and I think he was drinking promithizine because he is rapping to fast like he's from Milwaukee or Detroit lmao
The way I feel now is how I felt when Kendrick dissed drake this wave different bro iykyk
Crazy how he thinks he’s the new 2pac😂
this shit is hot ass tbh lol, you aint pac, nothing like him. Yb cant ever switch to positivity because all yall clout chasers constantly got his name in yalls mouth. You needed his name to hit a million views. Positivity would be focusing on yourself and try to make some music that people actually wanna listen to. You been through like 3 different waves and still aint leveled up
I’m weak I’m not gone act like nle not hard but why tf would he diss him 😂😂😂 shit funny asf
Ngl this the FSE

YB literally said the industry demonic and he demonic. This track by NLE has “The Most High” written in the beginning and sings “Yahweh” in part of the beat. The lyrics said “Had me looking at the Devil like, "This is your king" and “You just a pawn on the Devil chessboard, you done.” LETS GO NLE
Better 😮than YB
1.1 mil in less than 24 hours that’s a record

I’m Glad that the younger Generation understands what the true essence of hip hop is. It’s not real beef. It’s about going at the dude who’s at the top to see who’s the best. Bar for Bar in battle to see who’s the best. Choppa wants his respect as a MC. YB is your turn! Show us what you got. HIP HOP IS BACK!!!
Seeing Michael Jackson on this, would be more than a banger, legende never die😢
new age 2pac and biggie cant wait

Video tough AF , delivery on the song wasn’t the best though.
Talking bout YB a puppet for the devil when you were performing at pride parades ok buddy 🤡🤣
Like a pac😂🎉
It literally went over all y'all heads.. NLE CHOPPER is a prophet that's why he said directed by the most high. It doesn't mean he's going to literally kill him. It means that the most high will because he's not doing what he is supposed to do And that's waking up the masses.
We yk what side he chose 😂
Se puso interesante la cosa el género estaba aburrido 😂😂  se paso 🎶 y el video muy duro
Hip hop is truly in a bad place when this is one of the most entertaining songs of the year.

2Pac Hit Em Up Inspired 🔥
So much message in this , this biggest thing him being Tupac and Micheal the ones that was telling us this especially Michael. This is very talented
Ironic he callin lil bruh a demon with all this symbolism in this video.
Bruh, this reminds me of the rapper from empire(thats a show from the fox network. For the YTs) 😂😂😂.
A million in 24 hours is crazy
Homie looks like a goon with that bald head
same 🥷🏽 who made “free youngboy” n “free youngboy 2”😂😂
Bruh 3min to 3min and five seconds look at his feet
This gotta be the weakest diss song I've ever heard.  Mind you I thought that there couldn't be one weaker than the Tekashi69 dissing Thug. But I was wrong.  They're both horrible. Is this even considered rap?😂
The spiritual & Religious vibes, chris brown & micheal jackson dance moves,2pac & outlawz aura,Muhammad ali & mike tyson acting,thriller video vibes and the slave ancestor vibes makes this song & video a multi-million dollar  hit single
This ant no NBA youngboy diss just keeping buck 😂😂
You was working this hard to drop a whole 5 minute song bout one person you looked up too😂😂😂
Ain't gonna lie.. i see Tupac, C breezy, Torry lanez and MJ in one video 😊

NLE is a generational talent, yeesh.

This video insanely satanic. For the people giving praise to this is beyond brainwashed at this point. From the checkered board white/black pieces. Satanic pose symbolism. NLE Choppa wink when talking about the devil as his god.
Yessssss this is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Booty eeeeiiiiooooo😩😩🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
This is the type of music perfection that crosses all genre. I usually only listen to Spanish music but this came up on TikTok. I must say this is amazing work, the beat, the dance just wow.

Not a usual NLE fan. This is music. Heard he is dissing Young boy. Didn't know they were beefing. Thats how much I dont pay attention to him.
He has definitely reconnected grounded and downloaded. I’m here for it this is barely the beginning.
You’re saying he’s a wanna be, I say go for your dreams not just go to work n bars.
ts raw but bih cmon nie its ah li bit to late fa dht
Man wtf is even going on all I know is this mf a sell out. Black n white checker floors same ole shit in all these industry plant videos lol him and yb sitting back cool af

Meanwhile YB juss made 70 mil in like 2 months lmao
He finna get bta for this  yb gone drop sum crazy on him
Careful YB fans are gon be mad with this one
Corny you could made a song stayed out the beef and more money vs trying to diss or even a point across and still been cool with durk
Humble yourself nle remember you wanted to b like youngboy🤲🏽
Gotta do it in video because he know he can’t touch top
Big 🍇🍇🍇 shit
He bringing light that young boy a lost soul he said this your son Stan
Why is the message of this song going over peoples head?
I’m confused for this video all I know Micheal Jackson beat up Tupac word on the street but pac and Micheal one of my favorite but 😂because I am tryna understand nle we from America that’s the true motherland
Idk who told NLE he’s Tupac. But they were wrong
I like it
NBA: I can Say I saw it, you said I was yo favorite nigga!! . Nba top of the game he knew this was gone get attention
Ts ass.
This is so shit 😂 and what the hell is this gay ass video hahahahahhahaha
Ts so asssssss😂😂😂😂😂
BOOOY THIS HAAAARRRD‼️

I thought this was Chris Brown yo
No
Yb gone ko yo ass 😂😂

Be yourself and don’t follow robot opinion. This was hard 😂😂😂😂
💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼🔥🔥🔥
That's some real Memphis vibe catch up 😂😂😂😂
Ds ass
I like bruh creative asf.
This is one of the best videos I’ve seen like an artist this year. It’s almost over. Clock it. So much work in detail you gotta appreciate it. You can’t fall on that because these artists are not doing nothing like 4:19 this, they lazy. This was kinda mean but I got the point.
He Freemason and sold his soul
What is he talking about nd what made him drop this bullshit I know he embarrassed
This shit trash. Force feeding is these images makes it worse. The whole shit is cringe worthy. Not PAC at all. Of course ppl would say he’s not trying to be. I couldn’t tell. Major reach. The industry be diddy ing these dudes to the point where they just do what they’re told. You want this check. Wear this, do this, say this, etc and the fans watch yall get ran through. We need to stop supporting their destruction.
His message hard ASF tbh 😂
He spanked one of NLE thots 😂
bro went hakeem lion!
How u gonna be an advocate for street culture and gangbanging in ur music ur whole life, randomly decide to change (good thing), but then instantly throw stones at the people who haven’t changed yet when this was literally u like 2 days ago
But this is actually fire that’s y I don’t run with internet narratives
Hit em up
Better dis than young boys tbh
y’all know yb music is ass just got support by weird people it’s not love but crazy  NLE better 🤌🏿 OTF ❤
All Hail NLE THE Great👑 he ko young boy in his first diss track to him 😂
This is lit
RIP NLE hahahahahaha 🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍
Definitely inspired by Kendrick Lamar 🙊🔥🔥...
Stop buying views and bot comments you might as well keep the paper
Don’t look any further/Hit’em up
Tuff
This shit ass
yb finna merk you  fr🤯🤯🤯
NLE Tupac
YB  Better bro
Checkered boards go crazy
NLE came out swinging no cap 🔥

0:07 it’s giving MJ.  2:21 Why I thought that he was actually young boy for a minute until he put his head up😂 he snapped tho dis shi tuff asf❤ and he was actin like Tupac too… TUFFFFF!!! Idk what y’all sayyyyy😂❤ oh and Ali too😂😂
This is TALENT. Energy everywhere. If this was my artist after this project, I would be happy af. He did his beat so much justice. I was hard on so many levels.
Shame of a person for evolving and finding out what’s right or wrong is diabolical yeah praise YB but he even said his self how the industry is demonic and he’s a part of that demonic agenda. The fact is just like a lot of these artists YB is a puppet And he’s exposing it. Yes he’s not perfect but he evolved from that young ignorant kid YoungBoy still rapping about the same shit that he was rapping about when he was 17 18 and he’s young kids soak it up like a biscuit that’s what he means by poisoning to you. Anything to keep you from going to hell in a handbasket I’m here for it no matter who’s the messenger.🤙🏿
😮😮😮😮 K.O 😂😂😂😂
The one of the greatest videos ever also one of the greatest renditions ever. I’ve never listened to NLE but I definitely appreciate this. Very cultured very nostalgic. This video makes me realize how much I love being black. Beautiful historical. Thanks
Bruh how can u be worshipping the lord, and talking about trying to kill somebody at the same time
Ts is tough it’s so creative and sounds different for once
This 🔥
This shit lame af😂

This so ass watch when by respond back now choppy done
There’s so many things to unpack here! Like 1. I’ve never seen a RAPPER DANCE in his video with a choreography & everything!  2. What in the world started all of this?  3. This song is good  4 this video is very interesting  I’m conflicted two young fine dudes going back & forth isn’t what we asked for
If Bat shit crazy was a person
The song kinda hard but the video is pure comedy so most won’t admit it
Rip nle
Nle Choppa is our different version of mj
You know you done fucked up right
Sum1 gonna get slimed baby boy shouldn't be playing with yb
I fuck with it
Foh with that dance choreography
With NLE 🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦 real recognize real , matter of a fact Young Boy is a nyaopist here😂
He didn't kill YB but he did destroy hip hop with this one!!!
My guy done came a long way from playing ball in Atoka ...this junt go crazy
I love that he dances cause I think only lil baby and offset are hip hop dancers
Rip NLE 🙏😤😶‍🌫️
Absolutely love how all of the video takes place on the black n white chess board, especially how it started with the "ok" symbol, backwards.... Stay woke
Shit trash
Matthew 7:3-5  “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? 4 How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? 5 You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.
This was much needed especially for yb!!!
I like this. Sound more like he’s dissing yb choice of committing to that lifestyle
This is a funny ass skit
"poisoning the youth" same guy who made a career out of murder music
😭😭😭😭
Yeesssss NLE is back

Big boy league nomo young boys were tired of hearing and seeing this violence promoted on stage off stage online offline shii lame. Grown men handle things differently, it’s easy to unalive someone but are you willing to know what comes with it or after life when judgement day comes and the creator comes back?! blind leading the blind! Nobody is perfect that’s why it’s never too late iykyk..

Stopped listening when he said “ purposely making decisions to promote violence and bring more death to the innocent children, When I do it it’s different when he do it it’s different I’m in love with the art, he tearing people apart”… pretty much pot calling the kettle black .. both of em rap about ignant shit and promote violence at one point in time in the career when NLE do it , it’s different because he “in love wit the art” but when YB do it, he “tearing ppl apart”😑😑 GET DAT BS OUTTA HERE
HE ZESTY AS HELL…. 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾
Yb...please don't respond to this shit

This the zestiest diss video all time 😂
It's deeper than rap   Saying gods real name   Then hand mudras which bring out peace and positive energy   The chains saying he's a slave and keeping blk people's minds in a low vibrational state  Knowing people will copy what they see it's deeper than rap it's like mind control
Who Ever Shot This Video Hard Asf This About To Better Than Kendrick vs Drake Waiting On YB Reply 💯

Dude suspect. What’s with the gear though ?
Now me here after seeing yb…😮
He said YAHWEH in the beginning!!!
Nle done dropped him in the studio before standing on business. Nle has better rapping skill. And after this video I say nle can make better videos instead on just standing on the street smoking and barely moving and hollering. I fucks with this.
This is fucking FIRE

Just realized yb said in I Hate Youngboy: “Clean up on aisle O” (as in O-block) and at the end of this song nle says “clean up on aisle Trey”, (as in 4ktrey) he lwk was paying homage to king von
This better be the best video of the year🙌🏻🔥

BANGER! “Blow yo head off yo neck like a dandelion.”
🔥
i’m confused when and how did this unknown beef start …
Honestly, in this day and age, we should stop supporting music that glorifies drugs and weapons. Some people seem proud knowing that kids or others listen before going out to rob or get high.
Aey yo NLE 🐐 ‘ed
This shit fye
Ts so corny yb is going to just ignore this or knock em off
Nice creativity  lol but this diss not gone even make it across the street or ok radio 😅

PRINCE 👑 OF MEMPHIS
NBA is still better than you
Shit tuff he kept me watching with this one🤣
Nle might revive Youngboy career
that 'Hit em up' sample... ufffff🔥
Say he wanted clout is crazy 😭 but you diss yb cause yo music 💩 know like I know is better
Y I run to the comments like yo he when crazy on this danm
peep the checkerboard floor it’s a sign of the “elites”    it’s safe to say that nle choppa is 100% with them, they create fake beef to keep clout, nle and yb isn’t actually beefing, it’s to keep hype this how the “elites” control what you see and like by controlling ur emotions don’t protect ur energy when you on social media ts is very evil without you even knowing.
Clout a bad ass drug
The video is wayyy better than the song lol what is these lyrics 😂
Aura😭
10/10 ! 🔥🔥🥶
YBK
NLE 💪🏽 LETS GOOOO
If he wouldve released this while yb was on house arrest niggas wouldve been like he soft n only doing it cause yb locked down so now yb mobile x free lets see Yb's response lol
No lie all that dancing lookin sus 🤷🏽‍♂️
Iv always rocked wit nle so this shit had me dying especially since Iv never really fucked wit yb shit.. not saying he ain’t got bangers because he does 100% but just never could get behind his wave honestly
Who else got this bih on repeat
Trash 🗑️
this mf just woke up fr this is the real NLE
I thought he was fan 😕
Many Artists in one song!
Bro wanna be Tupac so bad but he not speaking real shiii
Nice video Choppa! Nice work 👏🏽
🔥🔥🔥 I wasn't expecting this cuhz spazzed off
He must forgot he made choppa flow what von would think bout this
This song is so amazing in the video is so awesome 😎😎😎
🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
Like it or not  He's still OUR brother NLE YOU ARE GREATER THAN A DISS TO NBA I can't STOP it, but I need both of yall TO STOP!!!!! RIGHT FUCKING NOW!

Hardest Diss Song Out Since Kendrick Lamar Mark My Wordz!!
NLE… Not Long Endings …you finished bro. He Finn do the same the beat n diss you probably
I cant lie; I sat through that in a trance! This shit was a new epic! It put Kendrick Lamar in the backseat with me......Epic
He made a whole diss on yb this finna end real bad
Nah why people acting like this shit not fire 🧐
Video 🔥
Hott mess
🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬 we are here
I don't know which side to choose 😅
I understand your message, but you should denounce the industry directly. When you mention YB, it shows that he's the one you have a problem with. Talk to your friends first, then you can talk to your enemies.
It’s crazy that he dropped this on Halloween. ( Dark Magic straight cooking) 🤔
YB shittest most  trash song is better than this Tupac/micheal Jackson ahh song
This shit ass
Bro this was the diss?
Clean up on isle trey is wild lol but dont confuse the diss with the true message.  This music is brain wash and creating criminals drug addicts sex addicts.  They want you that way so you cam except whats coming. They dont want thinkers they want slaves
Worse priced of music I’ve ever heard gang
I keep coming back cause it’s catchy and creative we ain’t seen that in a long time I’ll give credit when it’s due
South Africa
This is the wierdest diss I ever seen …
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
YB never said the devil was his king and you not a godly man yourself, far from salvation.
He did bro dance from druski interview show on YouTube 😂😂😂 pattin his pockets like He doing Cigs😂
Anybody notice the checkerboard floor … 🤔
Top gon go crazy on yo ahhhhh shoulda kept quiet
🙏 Why Nle You Drop Diss Track Yb, But This song is Very Funny and Fire
🇿🇦🎉
Lmao bruh I would be embarrassed
Mans got a death wish
Man watch out!
Straight RHCP dani california shiii
This song is trash lol

Here before this crosses 1 mil.
Talkin bout he the MEZZIAH 😂😂😂😂😂 NUN BUT DEMONIC POSSESSED SOULLESS DEMON!  I AM MATTHEW JUDE YAHWEH ❤️‍🔥🧬🧠🎁✝️
NLE a real artist lol this video different
Mxm🤦🏾‍♂️. These rappers really a bore
Checkers is Illuminati
so this song is trash.
Nahh this ain’t it yall - Charlemagne
Yb about to torch him in his diss song
I like it 👌🏾
Practice what you preach pshhh🤦🏾‍♂️
He dropped a bomb with that one reminds me of the 90s creative and original this what real hip hop is
Probably the best video in the last 20 years. Great song too. It’s a hit
I wonder why? these our South African flag 🇿🇦 on this music video! For real..
Music video was brilliantly ngl
W KO
Iran Iran
Is he really bald
😂😂 😂😂😂😂 shit is hot dog water wtf 😳 ts hurting my ears holy garbage 🗑️😭😭😭😭😭
Where was you when he was screaming stop the violence 😭 you just mad you can't be YB lol bitter asf
I see a south African flag shout out choppa💪🔥
FUCK THESE YN MUSIC AND BOTH OF THEM ARE TRASH…
THATS THE NLE WE WANT !!!!!
Stay prayed up 🫡🙏🏾
Had to listen to it 3 times in a row but let me tell you to all the real human beings like me who ain’t bots. This is actually decent.
YB BETTER NLE CHOPPA WATCH YA BACK OR IMMA CATCH U IK YBS FAVORITE FAN I WILL END U BIG 4KT CUZZ ON MY BRUHHA 💚
trying to beat 2Pac so bad that why you fell off
Wow, do this style and leave the dissing behind and I’d be a fan. This was so impressive dude. There are aspects of your messaging I totally agree with though. Good work!
The floor come on choppa smh 🤦🏾‍♂️ not u too
This actually not bad but people gonna hate on it anyway lol
Bro was yo favorite rapper
I feel like the song goes, this type of flow is more unheard of specially nowadays I will say he's in a sense bringing it back, but overall apart from the young boy diss he said a couple woke things in there, If you open your ears, you know maybe you don't it's not my business.
Yb dissed this foo like 2 years ago nle barely figured out what to say 2 years later just to get clout cause yb on top rn😭😭😭
No cap this shit ass
He acting like he found God when in reality this man sold his soul
NLE has always been the most talented rapper amongst his peers he's just failed to really capitalize on it, I hope he does now
This is the real thing now Pac is proud am happy
He on tour making more money then u
This nigga so lame he went from his biggest fan to his biggest hater 😂 if I was by i wouldn’t even respond he a real 🤡
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thank you man yb about to go crazy
Bro should know yb gonna cook him😭
💚Dancing On free Masons Board Y’all Both Are Pawns That’s Just Keeping The Collective Distracted. 💚
Because he making more money then  u nle Choppa u is a hater
The cover, flow & scene 2:22 is from “ill mind of hopsin”   NLE killed this shit. I’ve always had respect for him !
👀
I love this conversation. (I'm 35 now) This is where it's important to listen to our  elders. I love the crystallized wisdom part. Yes, you can be young and have it all together, but through time you learn to KEEP IT GOING. Experience over time is what matters. I'll give an example... YOU play ball in your 20s and hurt yourself or break a bone. And you heal from it. That's not going to be the same TYPE OF HEALING YOU WILL GO THROUGH IN YOUR 50S AND 60S. Yet, you still have to find a way to make it through just like you did back in the 20s. That's why it's important to understand, WITH AGE, comes wisdom if you receive it. BECAUSE there is also a thing called A BREAKING POINT. You only can reach that with TIME! It can either be used as a Breakthrough or a breakdown. Either side only gets harder as you age. crystallized...
It's Creative.  I love it!
I think NLE bout to wake up the Beast in Y.B we gone see!
He on checkerboard floors…. Go look up the meaning. He part of that group that ain’t right
🇿🇦South African here 2:17  love the homage. Music video is fire 🔥 I'm sure even yb is gonna enjoy this
Now this reminds me of the 90s very creative and original
YB BETTER💚💚💚
There is just a lot going on in this video
No way soon is NBA Youngboy Turn

Everyone d riding yb so hard. Cant make no money without mentioning yb.
This shit was hard 😂
What made him put out this trash 🚮
U too conscious for this bro
Dressing and acting like you're Tupac because you randomly dissed someone who you made songs about supporting. Person who made "Slut Me Out" saying that the children's minds are being poisoned.
Trashhhh
Yo nle you have to go back to the old you bc wtf is this bro shit lame asf I’m not tryna hate but this shit ass
Zesty ass NLE choppa. Wtf is this crap. Dis ninja gay as hell. Na this gotta to be the gayest diss ever. 😂😂😂

Gng just take your lose or one of you guys will end up dead 😢❤
I get the message and morale of the song and I like some of your other music but dissing yb for talking about killing, drugs  & violence like he don’t have any pain songs, hustle songs, love songs etc but how can you diss somebody for talking about violence by saying you gonna kill that person 🤔 i don’t get it🤷🏽‍♂️
Freaky groovy ass diss 😂
Clean up on Asile trey
The song sucks
Yo who last rapper to have moves like that so clean
First this I hear is gods name
This is art, most creative shit I’ve seen in a while. Well done 👏🏾
Thank you man I need yb to have a reason to drop
KO, KO!! 🔥🔥
Not bad  😂😂
This hoe jam. It’s called Art and actually putting effort into your work for all the Gen -Z lames in the comments hating. i like some of YB music too. Looking forward to response
All he did was rap about murder while trying to send a positive message 🤦🏾😂😂😂
🇿🇦nle
Bro really doing it ❤
💯 did not expect it to be good as it was
Somebody cancel this clown
NBA is who NLE wish he was. Tf is this lol
The end is out of pocket! The record is meh but the video is dope
This is memphis rap we aint had since Playa Fly peek
Ima a yb fan and yea this kinda hard ngl. He is calling him out and I gotta give him  props for having the balls to dis him when others scared to and he not even saying nun bad fr he just don’t like the energy he put out. And yb do have the youth in a chokehold. If yb started rapping like Cole blacks and yns would wise up.
Don’t get killed
This shit hard I don’t think it’s meant to be taken seriously they’re both millionaires rap beef is fake & YB can’t lie he making poisonous music for YNs to crash out too
Ain’t gonna lie this is hard 😂

DEATH ROW VS CASH MONEY WAS NOT ON MY AGENDA FOR THE END OF 2025 😮

“Dat was cute”…it’s still 4KT 🐍
Bullshhhhhh yb better 🔋🔋🔋🔋🇨🇼🇨🇼🇨🇼🇨🇼
Bro is literally many characters on this one 💀
This ain't it choppa...
Nigga said clean up on aisle trey
video way better than the song >>
bro he hitting with the belt just made me fall from the chair 🤣🤣
This was visually pleasing and message was clear and loud music is taking on a new direction
Litrally has a song titled "free yb"
He done fucced up and wit for the wrong person
This shit was so ass😂😂
Nle snapped cuhh 💤🌴🔥
This is ultimate hate you wish you were in his position & I’m not even a youngboy I’m a certified old head but I know jealousy when I see it this shit trash you a clown 😂

YB BETTER💚
Only 800k in 20 hours if it was yb I don’t even need to say no more
🔥🔥🔥🔥 clean up on aisle tre🔥🔥🔥🔥hard af
Let’s be honest this a fire diss
It’s hard though
YB gone put a cigarette out on his forehead 😂
Ok he on sum other shit I fwit ❤❤❤❤
Fasho a regular nigga could not make this no cap it’s actually kinda hard
entertainment got y'all thinking these beefs be real, both of them working for the same master, look at the Masonic floor in this video, they both contradicts themselves, choppa tapped about gangster shit then went spiritual then became zesty now he gangster again same with yb he had a interview where he showed remorse for all the poison and gangster shit he put out then moths after that interview he back pushing that poison he said he would make it right and clean up his image but he still on that gangster shit...it's all orchestrated
Ima yb fan bt dis shii kinda hard i aint gon lie …😂🔥 im just ready to see wat top do‼️💯
This was hard. I hope nobody die
This is 🌈
YB’s coming🤠
Whooop🎉
This shi so ass like wtf😂🤦🏾‍♂️
White guy 46 here. I will sing the n-word out loud when listening to this banger.
Crazy Work 🔥😴
The difference is nle shaved his head like pac, dresses like pac and calls himself 2pac...... YB gets compared to 2pac naturally..... YB better
What a banger
0:40 the whooping scene omg lol
I dunno why this dick riding generation, keep sitting on Yb's dick. M not a fan of nle but i listen yb sometime but if any one look at the ryhme scheme and flow. It's first time i can say nle write better then yb.
Was this a threat I just watched ?
Nigga a fan frfr
All this rap stuff is to make it harder for kids without dads to break into corporate America. 50cent told you the most watched show by blacks and Hispanics is Power. I bet those fans are the same that will be affected if food stamps are cut off. If 10 of you project dudes try to be LeBron, kai, or 21 savage one will be successful. The other 9 will work as a security guard , trap or scam .   Imagine those kids trying to be like Elon Musk . 1 out of 100 will be billionaire. The rest would be smart enough to impact their community positively. Not fight with each other for 300$ a day posted on a block.
Nle better 🇿🇦
This is stupid you chose a side over e need you had nothing to do with because lil durk was popular and now durk gone  and nba selling out stadiums so you dissing for clout you lame lame
So nobody in the comment section is going name the visual references😬    1) Tupac Shakur   2) Michael Jackson  3) Mike tyson  4) Muhammad Ali   5) Prince  -I'm missing two more. Can't remember where the scenes came from.
24hrs for Nba to respond 😂 he Nle killed it 💯
This corny af. And that beginning was sassy af ...smh
bring da old nle back iwl

The Drums From 2pac Hit Em Up
I like the message but the not the right messenger for this song lol. NLE Choppa’s entire career was built off of making gangster rap music and also folks comparing his image and style to NBA Youngboy.
4kt pack 🚬⛽️💨
YB or you seeing this😂
😝😝😝😝🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yal not understanding what he really saying and doing. All power and respect to nle fr. Me made a change for the better and for the youth ! Nba youngboy is actually poisoning the youth and I get nle has in the past but he made a change years ago for the greater good. The diss may seem random but this been sittin on his soul for awhile now , nle is a Scorpio, they understand the depths of humanity, nba a libra and a puppet , he do what ever his label or “they” tell him to do just to keep the balance but not worried about what’s that’s doing to this generation. I really appreciate you nle fr !!! 2:19

Not gonna lie the beat, the moves and set up in this video are on point. This is how rappers used to go at it back in the days. Whether you like him or not this man made a strategic money move because people are already talking and watching. Get that bag and stay blessed.
Checkerboard floor the whole song pay attention
As above so below referenced multiple times throughout the video, check board floors. That boi done tapped in and took his oath to them that fraternity out of Philadelphia. Union Lodge #32 not to far from him tho 🤔

Bro the creative turn you made. Shit is craaazy
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Goat nle choppa
I stand with NLE, YB raps about the kind of shit that influences the youth towards crime. I understand NLE was there at some point as well but at least he's changing his ways. To all the people supporting YB it's honestly sad to see that you approve of what he raps about. This song was just pointing out facts in a way where it fits hip hop culture.
Here before 700k view 👇
CHOPPA 🙌🏾🫶🏾🙏🏾I love this one 🤝🏾🖤🤍Ayeeeee PURPLE RAIN ☔️

Confers that Jesus Christ is lord you still got demonic symbolism in here mixing the truth with lies and coming in the form of light this is religion tradition and false practices and teaching you coming in the form of light but you are not doing the will of God this is literally was a ritual the glitter shirt demonic movement you did this to level up it’s clear your in competition with him not in opposition with him good cop bad cop same agenda yall don’t fall for this garbage 🗑️
🔥 🔥 🔥
The Blind will never be able to understand the meaning behind this song

Wtf is this shit!!!!
Yb finna do yo ahh dea worse way
Okay young fella!!! Address these goofies! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
About goddamn time someone made a good fucking song
Yessir you did that Chop I been waiting for this NLEChoppa for life 🫡
God was speaking through NLE Choppa when he recorded this song. NLE only 22 & already so spiritually awake, YB older than him but no where near as enlightened as him. This is a divine song. If you know, you know. Obviously low IQ, low vibrational NBA Youngboy fans will have no idea what I'm talking about.  Kentrell Gaulden is one of Satan's Greatest Soldiers.   Just gained so much respect for NLE Choppa. Protect this man at all costs! Symbolism when hes carrying YB's head --- Kali the Hindu Goddess slaying demons and taking their heads.
Tranna revive u carrier huuh ? Make sure it doesn’t go wrong son!
Who is here because of jahnny 💚💛❤️😊😅
Running with his head is crazy
this shit is so ass omg

Bro made 2 free youngboy songs, came out realising songs like shotta slow and camelot(murda music) wich is obviously yb influenced, he said yb was his favorite rapper, and said king von was his brother and rip (king von was literally a fucking psychopathic lunatic). He's a hypocrite, if j cole made the song then you know what, i would shut my mouth. And he acting all tough with a fake yb, disrespecting him, and we all know damn well he wouldn't do that in person😂😂. Hes a cornball. Yb better, cant wait for his response😂😂

Said yb influencing men to hit on women when bro got lyrics for days talkin against that, literally on MASA on When Time Pass he said "just get a 🥷who gon love u and ain't beat u"
This was tough🔥 and creative
Well thought out I love it ❤go ahead and get it!! The thought in the lyrics and the video…
ds song 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾
lol fam don’t know rather he wana be saved n do right or give his soul to the  higher ranks! All publicity ain’t good publicity maneee

OK bro I mean I was so happy to see that NLE finally just dropped, but I gotta say I'm kinda confused with this one...
he not serious bra 😂😂😂
He took out the part where he said his name?
I fully understand this video because he tryna say yb is poisoning the youth putting bad things into there minds and U fully understand this
Michael Jackson and Tupac all in one. Frl frl.
Ts harder than any rap out nowadays, actually relevant. Notice the black solidarity and movement. Shi going over the head of a lot of you zombies
This was definitely Different
Yea he tryna diss the world 😂😂‼️
Holy shit youngboy boutta go in 😂 a fan turn clout chaser
I listened twice and had to pay attention to catch the message and I agree with him 💯💯 but youngboy finna blank 🤣

If yall don’t see all the MASONIC symbolism in choppas video you need to WAKE UP and GO RESEARCH that checkerboard is just the beginning and NONE of these CELEBRITIES will TELL you CHOPPA is SHOWING you they are all in on it and you are on the out. Don’t listen to me go read.
Straight creativity… young boy bout to have guns and drugs and the same shi in his videos

NLE PAC Ali
We had drake vs kendrick and we about to get nle vs young boy might be another year for rap but will see
goat!
Definitely a symbolic song! Seems exactly like he worked with the powers of evils on this one but was blind/proud enough to chant The Creators name with whole bunch of symbolic darkness and even in the lyrics. He even dressed like a weirdo, and he threw up the 666 sign! Like idk if yall see this 🤧  but thats an evident video this brother has went dark! I pray for him man, its sad especially since he just went on the kirk Franklin podcast.
Damn Muhammad Ali MJ Tupac tupacs beat and dissing yb and wearing the death row records chain that’s wilddddd so much in one song
i guess the spiritual shit wasnt paying the bills now you 2pac 😂you didn’t drop this when he dissed you and YOU said it your self he killed you on that track now you wanna start shit,bro im ashamed to say i used to listen to you 😂
I think it’s mad as how he had 3 scenes of some of the greatest artists and ended with Ali bros showing respect to some legends in this
That's a sample of a lil humor... It's gone get serious for sure!!  Rapping chopper gone chop.....YB  really gone haft to step up...NLE can rap mane!!
The fact that y'all can't admit he snapped...make it even more better 😂🔥🔥🔥
Gay 😂😂😂
This is like a Donald Glover type video! Genius!!!!
Lame asf yo 😂😂😂
You dissing the industry with this one. People don’t know what the checker floor stand for!
Yeah this shit actually solid and video wise. Top notch Visualization

Dammmnn what the fuck they got on this guy to make him drop such a cringe ass video and song…
Yb literally called out everyone was gonna start dissin now that he on tour… yall jus prove em right
😂😂👎🏿👎🏿
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
We liked Nle in 2016-2021 but you think you can drop a dis, yb bout to make the a banger and drop a bounty on your head
2:28  is that suppose to be Teyana Taylor? 😂. I forgot she YB choreographer
Nle used too b good then he turned into a gay freaky ass man so I really think he’s gay
Fuck no!!!!
This is hilarious 😂🤣
The same thing he's downing in this song is the same thing he's standing up for in the song. You can't be bias. King Von was no better man than YB is. And if the shoe was on the other feet Von will be doing the same thing. Actually Von would probably do it more disrespectfully to be honest. If you would be right there beside him. You can diss YB all day for killing your homeboy. But you can't call him the devil if you won't say the same thing about Von. Because Von had bodies. To be honest I wouldn't call either one of them the devil, both just had unfortunate situations before fame. But both of them have hearts for the people they love.
Looking at the comments learning young people are simple and not catching everything in video and what he saying also the black shirt in the beginning Tupac had on smh I’m here for nle
he wanna be mj,tupac,ali, and yb this nga so goofy 🤡🤡🤡
Every season NLE The Great season 🔥🔥🔥🔥 haters gon hate!!     can't deny NLE The Great  been in his bag since day one, but that HIPVIEWS DAWT CAWM boost is on another level! Dude’s literally unstoppable now. 🔥💥ns like me

NLE directed this?! Dude is talented
This shit was ass im not going to lie. Im not a fan of either but the cadence over the best didn’t go together. The visuals were lack luster and seemed very much so forced. Creative, yes but, musically it was all over the place lyrically. Some subtle jabs with mediocre word play. He could’ve done better honestly.
Dont make me choose for you
🎉❤
ASSSSSSS! 💩
I have mixed emotions…this is lo key fire, lo key zesty, lo key corny🤣🤣 YB still better tho

Not like us but from K-mart

Video is tuff but lil bro I need you to be more consistent with your message. You promote the same thing you’re calling people out for.  Just because you sprinkle a little positivity in it doesn’t mean you’re any different.

i've been following NLE for a while, and it's really nice to see how he rounded out as a person. and for people saying he's soft, he's quite literally still singing about threatening people. is it soft just bc he stands for something greater now?

Notice the duality checkerboard the Masons use.
I think he Lowkey flirting😂
This shit trash af 🗑️
another yb banger otw
Aside from the good visuals and song, I just have to give my honest opinion about this & it wasn’t a smart move. NLE, you’re supposed to be spiritual now, claiming that YB is also the result of why the youth is fucked up (he didn’t lie tbh), & care about being the spokesperson of peace and shit but you turn around and do the exact thing you claimed YB always do.. Diss and spread more negativity. Boy you is a hypocrite and why I don’t take you seriously
welcome back pac
He ain’t lie tho
Ngl as far as creativity goes this one of the best videos I seen in years 💯
W song
hey siri, play i hate youngboy.
Grown ass man tryna act like other grown men shit gotta be a joke or a cash grab bc ain’t no way you thought you was getting to too many with this 👎🏾😂 don’t even deserve a response 😂🥲😂😂😂

Yo this is some weirdo shit 😂 nba be doing the same weirdo shit too 😂
Bro is better than nba young boy
This man nle bout to make history repeats it's self
Killed IT!! 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
How he saying boy is promoting violence and domestic violence and drugs in this, but he is calling himself Yahweh, which should make a fake Christ , which is everything that’s along the same lines so if yb aura  make him sick and his should  make him sick too
The creativity in this is nxt level
WHAT YAZEW JAHNNY I THOUGHT YOU WORK WITH ETHIOPIAN RAPPER FOR REAL JAHNNY YOU DID IT በዘነዘና 😂 🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹

Ethiopia 🇪🇹 Johnny
DeathRow Tupac onale WORSE thn Youngboy
Ian gon lie I get da message but da video throws a lot of people off I’m jus sayin where in da history of rap/hip hop where in a diss song video da rapper dancing doin mike moves lol now u would think dat part in da video would be making fun of da opposition not him ijs
He said when I do it it’s different I’m in love with the art you tearing people apart!! He said a mouth full I watch the video back 5 times
This unironically isn't that bad
Can’t lie creative as its finest
Ts tuff
All bad yb about diss your ass back but on a hole diss track
Ts ass asl cuhz
Corn........ ball !!!!
Very creative , he overly fucked up though . That man has already admitted to being part of the destruction of the youth . A man with humility is a dangerous man lol .
3:40 yo
He’s still going through his initiation with the The Most Higher Up of the World.  Pay attention to subliminal and occult communication signals.   The intro with his hand on his left chest…he was stating who he aligns with.
Yesss okay here is my take… Everyone uses this beat for a diss, Tupac, Khia, and few other artist but for some reason it still gave the old school style with this. Idk where the Michael Jackson reference comes from lol this was Dennis Edward & Seidah Garrett but he ate the dancing up so I appreciate it… I like YoungBoy as well so I will be seated for a response but NLE I like this ❤
U lost yo mind?
couldn’t make 70m’s even at his prime YB BETTER
na ts got me crying 😭😭
This shit went #1 Wtf
I am 33 years old, and after this video, I think I might get invested in the YN beef lol 😅

JAHNNY YAZEW WHAT ANOTHER LEVEL GREAT WORK MA BOY THE HABESHAN BOY 🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹
Why Does Nle don’t want to make it to Christmas 😂😂😂 real niggas don’t baby oil down they body to sing a diss 😂😂😂😂 4kt Top Masa don’t got time for u broke nigga trying to get a hype 🦦
Im trying my hardest not to see this as corny
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This fake ass Tupac tryna diss my goat🤦🏾
I know I am about to sound old af but I have seen interviews of NLE Choppa but never any music. This is the first song/video ive seen and this is a wildly creative way to diss somebody!! I enjoyed it. Not familiar with YB either so imma do some research and try to see who I think is going to win. Hope these young men stay safe though and keep it in the lyrics though, however it goes.
“I hope you know you gone get itttttt” 😂😂
King of corny
YB about to drop an album about you now
This is trash I don’t think this isn’t the NLE Choppa we used to know bro
This is art piece. One of the best videos I’ve seen in a while.
What are the chances I was just looking up their beef without knowing he made a song on it just yesterday
wtf did i jus watch LMFAOOO
YB loading 9MM yelling hollow points into his phone to go live and yell at the screen 😂🤳🏾
This shit was fire you know the style the video and aspects and flow just not the lyrics and that goofy ahh vibe other than that WOAHhhhh HHH
I don’t listen to either artist but this straight comedy 😂
Ninja we hit em up
😂🔥🔥
unlocked that 2 pac era
Nigga this shit fire fytb 🔥🔥🔥 mfs really some haters and ride yb like it’s gon pay y’all or sumn😂 YB NOT THE BEST rapper
His word play was Kendrick Lamar worthy on this I had no idea
Y’all can’t even lie, ts was hard
Matter effect: pac passed after hit em 🕊️💔 Stay alert bruh
The video so creative and he speaking pure facts about the community man bc if you pay attention to people who listens to Youngboy a lot the music has so may young people shooting and fighting I personally know people who listened to his music before they went to do criminal activity man.  Idc what any youngboy fans gotta say bc it’s definitely possible to look up to somebody and they have a influence on your life but once you have different views on life and grow up you realize the person who you once idolized is not what you want to be associated with anymore and NLE lyrics went crazy on this song
yb better this shit dirt
NLE sacrificed his career for this lil as song! Made a whole choreography as well.. 😂 nba finna drop the crazzziest album
Oh…..
Boy this is trash 🗑️ wow
Look at that floor
Good music 🎉
He's on his head literally.

Straight garbage 🗑️ 😂 that's why NLE will continue to eat at the bottom. 😆.  iF I was YB I would laugh. 👏🏽. All this energy and time n performance he made to get his attention. LMAO!!. What a 🤡.  Ain't he the one that shot at his BM?  Please. YB working. Putting in hours for his family n kids. Unlike NLE who doesn't feed his kids. Tred lightly NLE. 😅😅
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
welp
Dat shyt ahhh gng
Future millionaires like this comment !!!
Old head and im sitting here watching NLE video diss this guy with the entire black experience. That said I still hate that rappers will act like they really are in charge of rap when I know it’s really label heads who want the beef more than the rappers. NLE was given a budget to produce and promote this so literally this is a record label trying to take down NBA Young boy and not the just NLE Choppa. Youngboy and Baby will never say that out loud but that’s the truth
<3
Omg this so trash can’t even know what he saying
This nxgga gon bring the REAPER YB back 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
As a South African..This aint our beef..

Nle u done woke up the devil with this  one stay alive my friend 💯
I like the song but wtf erica doing 😂
I get why he made it, NLE is a natural entertainer. 😅😂🫡🔥🔥
from my inerstanding this might be bigger than music this revolutionary, like biggie vs tupac era all over again bc they both have an influence on there audience but which one is gonna di first is the real question
ds so buns
🇿🇦
Bad 😂😂🎉❤
🔥🔥🔥
This video is dope
Nle gave us a mixed of tupac and MJ
That’s my Boy 🔥🔥hell yeah
I dont wanna see this rivalry 😢😭
This guy must've lost his mind along with his hair 😂😂😂 YB ready put  to a>>
Hem and clip.
Unpopular opinion but the song wouldve been firee if it wasnt a yb diss. NLE is very smart i wish he wouldve talked about the injustice, political issues n how corrupt the system had become
It's crazy cause they pick the beef with young boy and then try to become big to get clout off his name and then when he? Do some to them it's all his fault i'm not d riding i'm just saying stop picking industry.Fights you a growman in nle where was this in the energy before i think y'all just pick industry beef just to stay relevant
Trash
YoungBoy has an undeniable influence over today’s Black youth, but much of the energy in his music is dark and destructive. Most listeners don’t analyze the message—they’re drawn to the emotion and energy it brings. I understand NLE’s perspective: when you reach that level of influence, you carry a responsibility to use your platform to promote something more positive to those who admire you.
0:36 why this man put the BTA like that 😂😂😂😂😂☠️☠️
All the truth ❤❤🎉🎉
Bro got me doing the jackson an the pac at the same time

And was literal friends with a serial murderer. But sure youre "gods messanger" and defending the youth. This has gotta be clout chasing. The song was cool tho, just dont follow the high horse holier than thou bullshit thats being spat out.
Clean up on  nle
I thought boys bands were over.

I applaud the message until you spoke on YB. And he hasn't said anything about you in years. This sounds like jealousy, want some attention, and a mental illness!!! If you jealous over a concert that's playing old diss songs. You was meat riding when Durk was doing it. Sit back and enjoy the show. You niggas cry to much! When it's not your turn!
Honestly this is a banger
Im the only one this gave goose bumps?
This dude NLE is a 🤡🤡 he think he is tupac is what make this funny af lol..he sayin all that about YB and running around promoting fa99ots😂
Dressed up as a bunch of G.O.A.T.S.
Niggas didn't listen to "tellem i said that" by t.i and it shows. . Them jews LOVE YB and protect him well. He's the industry leader because of his detrimental ways that he leads the youth to believe.
Boy snapppedddd
Be yourself smh nle another follower tryna find another moment to get attention he obv ain’t get enough from going bald he the same dude that got a song called free young boy😂😭

Happy to see a  🥷 with heart and soul hard to find ,
Not finna cap video is coo I did enjoy it. Can’t get down with you dedicating it to whole other man. YB is in his 3rd prime right now this is when you decide to drop a diss? You clout chasing. If you really cared you wouldn’t have to do all of this you could’ve posted a message but you want to grab attention from YB success right now. Clever video nonetheless👍🏾

This looks like the industry got REAL desperate.  They had to resort to nle to diss youngboy because they tried to blackbal him an they couldn't.  An nle probably running low on funds so a bunch of white guys got in his ear. "Ur the new Tupac man, come on" . An nle crashed out an did it. Lol videos gay af. Which is fine if u into all that. An he look coked up. But what do I kno fr
What kind of dance diss is this YB will be laughing at this him self.
MASA

This a diss track😮.   So many concepts in 1 video.
The visuals & message is deeper than surface level, but to highlight someone currently at the top of their game with crazy motion will surely make this controversial.
trash

He said he embrace his light and his dark why he ain’t doing the same. And he also said a few drugged out crashouts make u think u the one who can lash out . For ex lil dump that nigga is clearly dopped tf up. And I seen a video on TikTok of some of his goons recording they outfits while they was back stage or something and ig yb was mad abt his cloths yelling n shi and when he came in the room his friends stopped laughing and the comments was like they is really scared of this nikka yea because they know how evil he can get.

Who else saw the south Africa flag
WHAT THE FUCK😮 Is it just me or do you’ll not realize this is gonna cause a war in our street between the fans of these two young artist and their camps… very creative work NLE!!! But let’s see what YB do now
This one's for Von💜🔥
He made this song cus yb making a labeled called masa and the album cover was just so disrespectful to the brown community and that’s the majority of his fan base but they are so conditioned they don’t even think this deep. He’s speaking straight fking facts and this is very symbolic he said “had me looking at the devil like this is ya king” ifykyk he is now considered the king of rap the youth loves him but he works for the negative forces he doesn’t help these young ones elevate he encourages them to like kill steal and just be evil
Used to be the biggest NLE fan. Til I found out abt YB🔥
This was the gayest diss video I seen. I’m confused af rn
Bout time. He ain't lying 💪🏾💯
Why the South African flag tho???  🇿🇦

For the 3% of you reading this I hope you become successful in everything you dream of and accomplish more than you ever imagined. I'm a young music artist from Chicago. I aspire to make it out 🙏🏾
🔥 !
For all the NBA young boy fans who simply are brain dead he is not dissing him because he talks about shooting killing etc he is dissing him because he doesn’t show duality the good and the bad hence the checkered floor and him saying why is he not doing his part as a nba young boy fan I understood this myself and has been my only gripe in young boys music is that it’s mostly him being super thug or about his mama it’s okay to be gangsta in music but also feed your fan base some knowledge n betterment sometimes
Can’t lie doe he lowkey speaking the truth. And I respect him for not beating around the bush and going right at him. Plus yb Rey drop so,e heat cuz of this
#yahweh
Ko but this just getting started hope you got more coming don’t stop

Yb betta
He diss treyzzz too
Actually a banger
Nice song, now stop starving your mf kid
wtf happened to you😭
dis lowkey hittin
Let's break down the symbolism: Youngboy is MJ For the longest are body been comparing young boy to Michael Jackson so what does nle Choppa done he decided to dress up like Michael Jackson in the video and dance like him, and stage design because he is considered as modern day Michael Jackson. People been comparing young boy to Tupac so what does nle Choppa do he decided do not just dress up like Tupac again and dresses up Makaveli but rap over a sample that Tupac use back in the day and on top of that what he do he intertwines both Michael Jackson and Tupac of the flow of the song.   YB gets compared to Chris Brown People also compare young boys to Chris Brown, but it's only a small few. So what does Bryson do? He also imitates Chris Brown in the song as well.  Why does nle also do it? Choppa did this because over the years, people say that he is a wannabe young boy or he's a young boy clone.  On top of that, I guess he's also making imagery that young boy is not Tupac young boy is not Michael Jackson. And what does this mean it also means that these two iconic figures are the ones that the youth looked up to positivity.  The hypocrisy of NLE He mentioned that youngboy is destroying the youth with the drugs, lyrics, etcetera, but the thing is Choppa was doing the same thing with Durk, Von, Savage, etc. I understood the message, but at the same time, it makes him look like a hypocrite for doing the same thing. We may not know what happened behind closed doors but based off a interview a while ago after the diss track dead young boy put out "Know Like I Know" NLE basically was saying he wasn't trying to go against youngboy but King Von was like a brother to him so he went with Durk to sum it up. So when he mentioned in the song he wanted peace and youngboy basically rejected it, it was more like in NLE was trying to cool it off, but didn’t.   Is this jealousy? Could this be envy from Choppa on youngboy has always gotten more recognition than him, maybe . Again, we heard several instances where people compare the two, and it's not even close when it comes to numbers and fanbase.  The controversy Choppa dressing/ imitating as Tupac. Back in 2021, he already imitates Tupac, and he has controversy. By doing that, some people praise them. Some people don't.  Video Symbolism  The black and white checkerboard and the black man looked at the Devil he basically saying that YB is the devil and he also is a slave to the system because we see the guy who's playing as YB is a slave and if you really look deeper into his tour name and his album is called Masa it's like a southern twang instead of saying Master its Masa. And guess what, who is the Masters, the industry, and let's not forget young boy for the longest been saying he want his Masters as in owning to his music a master for a master. So the video and his whole album and tour name are ambiguous when it comes to the meaning.
Shit funny but trash yb better
Oh he woke woke. War on ratchet n hood mentality has started😇🙇🏽‍♂️
Bro went out his way to find a yb look alike, d riding at its peak
He might can handle Chris in a dance battle

I like the song but how are you going to call someone else a puppet when you’re shooting this video with the freemasonry floor
you speaking on kentrell u speaking on my slime you speaking on my love
🔥🔥
I think people are starting too realize that being a drug addicted crashout ain’t it.
This has nothing to do with anyone trying to be like pac, while nle is speaking some facts, he just participated in a much bigger game. Yeah yb need to grow up and lead his followers correctly but soon as he try, them devils he birthed are gonna rise up against him. Truly I respect ybs honesty, he’s admitted countless times that he’s lost, but he also has millions of followers so what does that speak about them? Lost as well! This is also the generation that has to lead one day and it’s not looking to good
That ain't 2pac thats 8knot, Nah fr this go hard
This gotta be a publicity stunt
CLEAN UP ON ISLE TREY .... AKA 4ktrey
Disrespect to pac with this parody rap
Same nigga that made shotta flow btw
NLE is the GOAT
Stop the killing
That one is no question, the best version of NLE THE GREAT🤙🏽
Im torn because it's alot of creativity and paying homeage to tupac and some of the greats in history. It isn't your usual diss song though. The bars about him being a devil worshiper and this and that are kind of missing the mark because as a whole the image your portraying is similar. I fw NLE music but ive legit heard you say "I pop me a perc, then I pop me a roxy." Then wanna talk about YB being a drug abuser and ruining kids. ? It just makes this song seem like a ploy or a gimic. This gotta be a publicity stunt yall beefin fr.
🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅
Yk wht u got coming right ??? Stay safe slat🐍
🔥🔥
nle snapped nobody gon admit that 🎯😂😂
This shit ass
Dead Bro

#YBBETTER💚💯
This has to be the most hater ish of all time…I bet this dude had to talk himself into putting this BS out 😂….bro really sat back and said I need to put a diss out to young boy for absolutely no reason and out of nowhere, I know he probably got tired of seeing all of the content of NbA shows, seeing people crying and going crazy, the success of his tour all over the country, the younger generation calling NBA young boy this generation’s Tupac, his friends and family all probably trying to get tickets to the concert etc..he couldn’t take it anymore, he became hypnotized with hate like Boosie say..!
Shit ass

🐍🐍🐍 he gone get you 🦖🦖🦖
I'm lost.....is this a diss or a parody?🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Ts hard🔥🔥🔥
Personally, I think the music video and song are creative and catchy. But one thing I have to ask — does it glorify God? Bro doesn’t believe Jesus Christ is God — the King of Kings and Lord of Lords — and this song, like his last one, is a reflection of that. There’s no Holy Spirit behind it. Take the message how you will. May the Lord remove the scales from his eyes, mine, and all of mankind’s.
garbage
Only way u get attention is to diss someone you cant even see. Lameness
I think he still mad that fan beat him up for dissing YB a min ago

The music gon reach millions though,

Watch how young boy and his fans COMPLETELY miss the message. Everyone role played in this video are the true people who define BLACK EXCELLENCE and this is from a Hispanic! Create your own path and change history!!! never was cool to “crash out” snitch yourself out on a song then get sent away for life smfh youth gotta do better. young African Americans got the most talent and ability to lead others but they use it for the wrong shii as NLE saying. No he ain’t perfect but don’t mean he gotta keep doin recklace shii n promote it smh people grow up yall should too! @NLEtheGreat
He just started sum unnecessary drama 😂🤦🏽the next couple of months finna be krazy
Knowing yb his inspiration and knowing he cant out rap him but still make a diss is crazy knowing you not gone kill nothing
Everything you saying he do you done your whole career 💯
NLE im so proud of you but pick ya grave out, you finna die 😂💀

Clout Chasing, trying to ride that YB wave.  YB forever goated. This is disrespectful to PAC.

NLE 💔🔥🔥
But whoso shall cause one of these little ones who believe in Me to fall, it were better for him that a millstone were hung about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. Matthew 18:6    Most won’t get the message because the blinders are on. NLE thinks he gets it & still doesn’t. Double K.O. The visuals & choreography are very good but it’s still pushing the same narrative that YoungBoy pushes. There’s hatred, harm, & murder being displayed in your video too. You’re still misleading the ones you’re trying to reach. Some of the “GREATS” you decided to highlight were not so great in life either.
Nah ts hard for sum reason😂🔥
This shit is 🔥🔥🔥!!!!!!! Glad someone else thinks YB is wack af too
lol if he wanted to sing and dance then he could’ve just did that without randomly dissing somebody..💀💀
I don't know the reason behind the diss but idk vro,YB music sux ass

Young boy is super popular right now and he has a lot of fans and he's really up. But let's be honest nle is a way better rapper now. Not saying young boy. Don't make great songs for his fan base but nle is a better rapper. He's not going to win this but
wonder how long until dude dies now? we taking bets?? i’m saying 6months.

A rapper who raps about killing downing another rapper for rapping about killing
he got a few hours left to respond this was crazy
Ngl YB aura is a ick😂
Yal should be tired of using your talents and resources to divide ppl. Yiu could’ve made a song about anything yet in still here we are again with a fake woke person who hasn’t learned to deal with his ego. Yb just came home and haven’t said a word. If someone dies from all this I don’t wanna hear a stop the violence movement. It’s really stupid how we have to see this bs every year among successful black men.
He not lieing
This like when young thug went at lil Wayne now nle going at nba young boy idols turn into rivals lol crazy
He looks like he plays too much
Wtf is this
You gon make old yb came back 😂
First you need yo grow hair. Next ion know why you dissing yb you will get rolled up boy. Last this shi funny asf😭😭😂😂
This is probably the worst diss ever put out NLE corny as he’ll need to take this shit down
Man it’s Louisiana all the day fucc all that!!!
I’m a yb fan n this shit hard af.. this shit is talent.
This guy is fake bruh.  Didn't you say you looked up to yb? Same nigga who loved lil durk, praised King Von who was doing the same shit. If anything, you look like the puppet and a clown. That's why yb fans love him he never switched up. You clowns switched up like females. Now you want start a beef when this young man is at the top,  how ironic.
Smfh , KO .......
lol didn’t you duck a fade from blue face? now you wanna box? 😂😂
I hope you know like I know
Y'all fans be More lame than anyone in the world. Stop d riding,, it's cool to be a fan of someone's music but y'all act like y'all in relationship with y'all favorite rapper(s) just enjoy the music and stop picking sides
Bruh yb been chilling doing good in music now since he goin crazy on tour and still getting big numbers he a problem or getting controlled and he been stop the violence like 2 years ago so he changed his influence them Veggie’s fuckin up bro head

YB honestly shouldn’t respond. I don’t think he can do better. NLE is more lyrical than YB and this is a creativity level that I don’t think YB can get to.  So it’s best to ignore it. Keep doing ya thang on tour. YB already winning. No need to battle
NLE the Messiah. Definitely just gained a new fan.
Horrible

Always said YB wasn't no gangsta.....just an emotional bad kid who was treated bad as a kid an who is really mad about it.....but when you have a bunch of girls an lil boys as fans you start to believe what they saying about you being the biggest thug in the galaxy when In reality your just an emotional female with female dance moves
Straight up. Some og sounding shit

Yb be really minding his business 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂don’t end up like VON

This song trash. Dude up here dancing and contradicting himself — talking about YB not being a role model but then doing the same wild shit he preaching against. Whole thing just goofy. One minute he talking tough, next minute he moonwalking like he forgot what the track was about.

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lmaooooo man wtf did I just watch
Getem Choppa🫡💪🏾
This went over a lot of yall heads, At the end of the day NLE decided to expose the industry  Everyone already defending youngboy and it ain't even been 24 hours 😭😂  He really got his fans possessed shi demonic fr.
Two FM’s beefing
shi is like a musical straight outta disney🤣🤣
Why y’all acting like he ain’t rapping his ass off on this junt

Jahnny we proud of u 🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹🇪🇹
It’s like Safari in the breakfast club interview
yb yns mean asf
Thank u so much for the dis
YB lyrically cant do nothin about this. All he gon talk about is what him and some random YNs gon do to NLE when they see him. And aint gon do nothin in real life cuz he aint tryna get locked up again 😂
Brilliant production
Thought this dude was finding himself spiritually and becoming a better person?
NLE IS BAAAAACK!!!🔥
🔥🔥🔥
Are you manic ?
Comedians 😂
🎈🍀
As a hip hop fan I appreciate this this idk if this will go far but I love seeing all this competition in rap we been missing this shit!
Rap video of the year that's a fact
I Dont get if it's subliminal or in your face goofy stuff, the Rap game sucks right now man damn
Why he drop this trash as shit
I so enjoyed everything about this rap and video!! So creative and well executed by NLE ❤
🤦🏾‍♂️ cut it out NLE
nah this hard
Every mainstream dude is so damn zesty these days mf's ain't men no more, that's real talk!!!
What was the point
Did I see a Ugandan flag😂😂💯🕊️
Not like us pure comedy 🔥
😂😂 bro trying to be like Tupac still go back to that 2019 choppa this new shi not it
Ahahahahahhah creativity 10/10 yeah this is cold
Whyyy??😭
nle is a troll 😂
They are both very gifted musicians. The thing that separates them two, is that nle is really in his lyrical bag. Like bro can actually rap and it’s not abc hip hop. It’s authentic. Not to take away from Yb cause he’s the best & he’s finna crash out 😂😂😂😂😂 but, Choppa is really delivering a message. This will be good
He snapped with this one the visuals and lyrics on point he went crazy
Why this go hard though
Some bs
Tfc is this
2:09 shout out SA🇿🇦🇿🇦
2:21 that gotta be 21 or youngboy

He been waiting for awhile lmao he deserve this diss
Nle chopper is a joke. 🤣🤣 He need money so he went for NBA young boy because he knew everybody was gonna listen
NLE> NBA! Fr nle Choppa is actually intellectual. He been talking about this in interviews for the longest. YB promoting nothing but killing smoking having Yns crashing out everywhere. This is a grown man speaking to a boy right here and grown people understand that
This shit go hard ❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
who ever came up with this the goat because he definitely not old enough to even travel down this road
Here come the yb fans that choose to come here but don’t have to 😂
Am proud of my country Uganda 🇺🇬🇺🇬 🇺🇬🥰
🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️
He want some attention
yb diss? oh dis finna be better than the adin ross diss
i like this cos it different lol
this song is so ass
Choppa in his NLE TUPAC era. Clean up on aisle trey then holding up young boy head is diabolical. He fasho deserves his credit for his creativity 😂🔥💪🏿🗣️
Dissing while he on a how many city tour??? Wouldn’t diss when he wasn’t pushing for peace but trying to now. Mane I hope this record was worth it for ya! I’m SURE YOUR MOMMA AND YOUR DAD TOLD YOU TO LEAVE YB ALONE AFTER KNOW LIKE I KNOW. 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Meanwhile yall talking shit yall can’t see this lil nigga is charging up our opinion not gone stop this kid
Nigga... this shit 🔥

A lot of young boys fans won’t understand actual lyrics. Dude really slide and made a valid point. NBA is influencing a lot of bad stuff in our community and in the black culture. Our whole entire black youth look up to him as if he higher than the almighty Lord

YB you seeing this??
Yay I hate yb
Bro I genuinely don’t understand the line “just a nigga with emotions, a breast fed bitch” did he think that was hard? Is it because he’s vegan? The fuck 🤣
Where did he get that YB from 😂😂😂😂
Trash
This so hard 🔥
Shii is dookie water
On some kendrick shii danm🎉 Only the most high
Is Nle fighting for Durk can’t wait for dirk to be out. Dignity 🫡
Very deeply clever artistic creation
A song NBA will never even listen to
NGL this shit hard 🔥
Man this shit gine be a banger
This might get NBA Youngboy to drop something crazy right back.
I blame Kendrick Lamar.
An how much money he put into this
You mad yo daddy ain’t put u on the tour 😂😂😂😂 Came to yo city and all Screaming FUK DAT 🥷
😂
you can’t just watch this visual once 😭 NLE different
Damn.
I fell off ahh music 😭
Better then yb 😂😂😂
Can’t even take this clown serious
NLE has expressed so much love and admiration for YB. He’s got a song called “free Youngboy” with 32 million views. Only time YB acknowledged him was in “know like I know” in a negative way.   What I’m tryna say is, NLE is a legitimate portrayal of a “Stan.” Embarrassing tbh.
Yb better
If you Put the hate aside.. this shit is soo hard🤧🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This haaaaard
Look Bro..... Off Top..I'm not being Bias.. I Just Like Gangster Shit .. not Pac and KENDRICK Lamar copy cats .. Super pathetic ..I'll Probably , consider to respect This song only  IF ...Yes, only IF...NLE Chopper TAKES A PICTURE WITH A MIDGET HOLDING firebug filled BALLOONS, WHILE Dunkin Nutter Butters from a cup/ Catlyn Jenner's Jog Strap full of BREAST MILK FROM A COMBODIAN IMMAGRANT!! or Diddy will  keep the studio and Freak offs  shutdown until Trump frees him ... Can't rap about Gangster shit anymore MR. Positive - no H. I V....between me and my reflection... Shit BooBoo,.NAS X would've bodied this on the 2nd verse
Thank you bro. Yb finna drop a good ass song now thanks man

Super star 💫

The initiation for him. Black and white checkers board. 😅
This shit really hard😂😂
Wherent you on Von´s dick ? Wasnt he a killer? Bro u acting. Need some cloud cause u kinda dead in music. *And need a tupac beat and fit to feel yourself. YB is an artist, he speaks a lot of shit, true. But he also talk about depression and stuff. FREEDOM SPEECH. What about ur songs? SHOTTA FLOW? U dog shit dawg, u contradict yourself. Drop this diss and now gonna walk around looking over is shoulders.
Pathetic ass attention grab 😂 not even original at all😭 YB BETTER

The only people mad are yns and people that don’t respect them self yall don’t respect a black man’s positive change it’s sad to see that some of my kind would rather crash out be around a hole bunch of random women and not take care of anything for themselves the youth are poisoned they think money cars and jewelry is what life is but once somebody steps away from all that it seems weird being there for your kids paying all your women’s bills making sure your family is okay making memories for themselves everybody wanna as well money can’t buy that and still give a black 10 k and a chain there rich for life and still aren’t happy at the end of the day oh I forgot u gotta give them a switch or a Draco dude would be happy instead of a happy wife only one baby mother and steady income to take care of them it’s sad
Bro admits YB got Aura😂 This that gay type diss😂😂💔 NLE washed ngl, should’ve just came up with something else not to come for YB to get clout

Who else has noticed the Ugandan flag🇺🇬
Why the South African flag
Corny af
Bruh want yb fame
What the fuck did I just watch
Why is there a South African flag on there🇿🇦😂😂
Corny
Per usual people miss the message due to the ‘artistic delivery’. He spoke nothing but the truth about Yb keeping young crash outs around him, never doing any of the things he raps about and pushed/ misleads the youth and his main demographic(black males promoting violence). He’s never in his life walked someone down or ki**ed anyone, unless we’re counting an innocent female he claims. The guy literally claims every body that drops yet last I checked Tim was in court screaming self defense regarding King Vons death. Meanwhile, yb is on house arrest for years but the feds ‘approved felons, some with open felony cases to visit him whilst on federal parole‘ 😂- people are so dumb it’s actually sad. The yb stans truly believe with all of their heart that he’s this top gangster/killer because he can cuss & rap well over beats,hah.  He’ll rap about every body, yet hasn’t been outside until being ‘pardoned’. His sole purpose is to continue misleading the youth, and push as much black on black violence as possible.   All of this whilst being a federal CI but ya’ll won’t find that out for years due to his current monetary value. I know some of his stand will call it all AI when the day comes that he, and Quando rondo have talked to the feds more than once about,nvm just wait until you find out the truth about ya’ll’s idol.

Can't wait for yb
I think he has hidden messages in this video's visuals and lyrics. In the beginning when he is breathing, you can hear yah.. weh. yah...weh which means God. I recently learned that when we breathe, we speak the name of God. Just search yahweh, breathe in and out and you will be awed at the creativity of our creator.
I just loveeee the creativity in this video! He paid homage to so many people in this video. Even though it’s a diss song it’s so powerful. NLE Choppa is doing his thing. He has longevity in the rap game. 🔥🔥🔥

Man bye 😂😂😂😂
This not it
Unbelievable this best I have seen in a long time video is crazy good
Bro must have forgotten wat happened last time
🔥
Now diss von and durk since you're talking about poisoning the youth and the other drill rappers
YB is ahh
bro what are you doing 😂😂😂
So now he 2Pac Muhammad Ali and Michael Jackson🤨 this is really ironic, especially considering they we're calling young boy did Michael Jackson of this era.
0% damage
I don't hear nothin he saying
Hopefully this don't make grave digger go and have to remix who shot ya...
Yea youngboy finna kill yu boi if he hear this
Some freaky video wtf 😅folks tripping
But the dance moves makes this seem like a parody 😂
Say ten !!!!!!!!!! Is all ima say
You have truly shifted into one of the talented rappers of our generation genuinely
Ts so ahhh
2:18 now this part is really the facts… and the streets probably don’t want to hear this part.. but I agree…
This man just mad a mockery out of Pacs work this is so trash.. NBA has way better music honestly nothing he makes sounds this cheeesy
Anyone who dont fw this song or the lyrics are zombies and vibrate at a dead frequency 🤷🏽‍♀️
Do i get an undercover zest smell
I see you, Johnny.  🕺
This is like a Halloween parody SNL theme to me
NLE been talking to GOD lately. I guess about a sleep over 😮
you better have that Security with you
yo bald ass weak as hell
Great video , visuals is amazing. But who is he to say YB is poisoning the youth really this whole generation of music is .. he’s not the only one. people who are Cristian’s know it’s not okay to judge … especially considering the type of music he’s made past tense he has no right to judge. It’s great to have found God but judging someone else isn’t apart of being a Christian or isn’t Godly at all .. I think people forget what it means to be a Christian .. and HATE is a strong word .. what happened to being fruitful ? anyways God bless
Keep being different.
Clean up on aisle trey 😂
YB about to crash out with drunk birdman on the track 😂😂😂 #cashmoneyrecords
But tbh… this may be corny
We need dat shi to hit 1m
Naw this is the response to the YB diss…
Shit trash. Nigga gotta diss YB to try to stay relevant. Where this Energy was when he was on house arrest
Offset cant save You YB
Looking like a jealous clout chasing hater to me. Everyone know you always looked up to YB and have always wished you could be a fraction of his good he is. 👎🏿
2 pac

I am DEFINITELY out of my league because who Is NLE Choppa and who is NBA Young boy😅. And why is Choppa playing Michael Jackson, Tyson, and Tupac all dancing like Chris Brown calling NBA a sellout while I think he's running with his head and... I'm at a loss and need a whole translation from any of y'all who knows what any of this means. Thanks
🔥🔥🔥🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
You gotta stop d riding yb boys , you dnt know wht nle can do by him self , you acting like he cant stand on business,  you yb fans stupid , yb just makes noise and doesn't rap

Thank you for sending out your final message before you get packed up dummy
Just waiting for a banger from yb😂
NLE JUST WANT FAME

If YB drop a diss in 48 hours while on tour, he’s the GOAT !!
Is that his alter ego ?
Could only be 1 Tupac and will forever will be in my opinion
Idk bout y'all but I'm just as confused as y'all 😅

🚮🗑️
Nigga trying everything to keep his career alive 😂😂😂😂
Man wtf im mad ts hard asf
Shit not hard at all lmao embarrassing if u ask me.
It’s not NBA Youngboys fault, it’s the serpeant the devil which tried to get you NLE to cuss in the video and that snake tried to oppress you with his own emotions he has towards himself and then he tries to blame it on people like NBA Youngboy. Now don’t get me wrong God speaks through anyone at anytime, even the people that completely disregard HIM 🙂‍↔️😤 but His Holy Ghost I pray brings those people to His knees. Please just pray for NBA Youngboy and don’t repay evil with evil and FORGIVE FORGIVE FORGIVE SO THAT YOUUUUU CAN BE FORGIVEN BY YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER.
trying to summon the GRAVE DIGGER.
This is a Jordan Peele movie
I just can’t see why people are so opposed to a black man saying, YB ur the face of thinking upping the stick is cool, when it’s true that YB is.
Dang can’t believe this was posted 7 hours ago & This Music Video is Funny Asf 😂

Rip nle choppa  😂😂
Damn if bro wanted to die that's all he had to say😂
Ts was 🗑️ yb finna help u put this bs back in the vault 😤🤣
Great video, BUT his vocal tone(how he is delivering) poorly mixed & mastered audio(vocals specifically) combined with it make the song less pleasing to listen to. You can barely even understand the dude. Otherwise, I feel like it would  be a great production altogether.
Ethiopia 🇪🇹 jhanny
Cinematic masterpiece
wass up with the SA and zim flags 🦍💯
I get the song now its not directly abt yb but it is it's abt gunshooting and killing and promoting violence
Clout chasing garbage music

Now that I can fully tell it’s a YB diss, I can see he supposed to be rapping like yb.. 😂😂😂 my first mind was like “wth is this, but I just listened and watched 3xs now” and I get the vision.. shrugging 🤷‍♂️
Bubba dub voice 🗑!!!
Nle go crazy
the Mike Tyson neck exercise is hilarious!
Using a zesty song to diss someone 10x harder than him is crazy.  Yb will 100% body him knowmatter what his comeback is im shure. 😂
gay
This song is garbage
Why try copy yb style some shit yb would rap too
Video production=✅  Song and lyrics=-❌  This is the most awful and most stupid Diss that I heard in my life this guy is lacking but lacking MGK diss to Eminem is an anthem compared to this bullshit 😂😂😂 I don’t know what kind of niggga will be balling with that shit 💩
WHY HE AINT DOING HIS PART #YB
Wow!!! My mouth was open in shock the entire time lol The dance moves, the homage, the detail, the cinematography, the lyrics, the shock value, the confusion GENIUS👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is the most random diss in rap history where the fuck did this come from 😂 2:22

Dancing dissssss lolol😂
He must not know 😂😂😂
I’m just here before yb ends this man career with 1 response
It’s creative, but he’s acting like 2pac, mixed with Danny glover.. while sounding like an overly excited  Big Kirt.. I see what he’s doing, but it’s also clear, the man is an acting entertainer.. and we’re here paying it mind!  I think without this video the track would be more effective, but I seen this video first..
kidz bop meets 2pac hitemup ass rap 🗑️
Ain’t no way you disrespecting YB and work out free nigga they gunna play this track on your body in church 🤦🏾‍♂️

From an artist standpoint point this is great visuals! But from an original yn I'm in the unk age now but this shit lowkey zesty af😂😂😂😂 but the message got through!...🫡🤷🏾‍♂️
🔥 🔥
Shits ass
YBNBA' s Head
Aye😂😂 pause ! But blow ur head off ur neck like a dandelion😮 was original and kinda fire😂
I know ya'll seen the south African flag there. SA lets gather here 🥳
Nice knowing you nle choppa, and may you rest in peace....yb go easy on'em 😢
Now choppa just wrote his death wish 🤦🏽‍♂️🤣
Bro nobody takin yu serious😭 it’s js embarrassing

NLE Choppa + Chris Brown + MJ + 2Pac ❤😂😂🔥.
Imma be the first to say it, RIP NLE 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nle just saying facts. Yb got yall acting like wild 🐒
They said that about them black & white checkered boards
Cringey asf
jahnny on fire 🔥
choppa just created a moment in the culture we might be back to some real Grimey hip hop
💀
Can’t believe NLE just played in our face like that😭😭
The symbolism of him holding YB's head is so amazing. Anyone who's religiously or spiritually awake knows what that is a reference to. Amazing song, video, and cover art. Look at the cover art then look up on google images, "Kali Hindu Goddess" ... AMAZING.
Definitely thought outside the box for this video
Damn ts crazy he was just a fan of yb not to long ago 😒
Bipolar and multi personality disorder like a Mfka.  I hate to tell you this choppa but 2pac hated ninjas like you! You  do too much just like diddy 😂. U got the shiny  suits , dancing all in your videos. Wanting more than one chick & you have on a deathrow chain? While dancing in the video with a shiny suit on ??? No respect for the deathrow culture. 🤣 once u took that pic of your butt boi trust me  pac wouldn’t even like you if he was still here . But pac loved his little Homies shorty the ones like yb .❤ you don’t know 2pac
Aight Nle ,i see that 🇿🇦 flag
Gang what😂
Why tf is the South African flag in this?
Can someone explain where this beef came from?
Nahh this really showed ya creativity, this different Choppa 😂🔥🔥
YB Better !
Went from saying "He love yb, & that's his favorite rapper" fast-forward some yrs., now he's dissing him?.. I'm just gone mind my business though. Visual 🔥.

Truth is this track really goes but honestly speaking it should've been dropped like 10 hrs back when the fans was screaming that you and him was beefing but instead choppa bruh you played it off like it wasing beef so why now? Cause it's kinda looking like a hater move now that yb on his shit and im definitely not a youngboy fan and im not a hater I fucks with von and otf but you gotta admit yb is whats popping right now.
Young boy diss I see

Clearly y'all ahh fanboys and clearly missed the point Charleston White was right about YB and his artist dude spoke real sh and y'all waiting on YB to drop some more murda music 😭  Y'all looked straight pass the message of this video we're cooked
Belt to ass
NLE IS A REAL ARTIST. THE ELEVATION IS SO AMAZING
All the YB fans are saying YB is going to come back and crush it 🙄 but idk this was pretty good 🔥 going to hard to beat.
This nigga goofy dancing like it’s the 90s in a diss song
Any Ugandan here❤
What the fuck is this bullshit 😂
Im really trying to figure out why you think the illuminati care...
Tupac wanna be ass
Dis one will be number 1 on trending for music tomorrow watch 😮 dis that 1 no  capp
yeahhh, of course yu drop a diss track years later, its the only way for you to stay relevant, yu went bald like tupac and then you diss nba yb, stop using other rappers names to get numbers, its lame and its not gangsta
No lie this funny & fire at the same time 😂😂🔥🔥🔥 I FW with it

I can’t never hear the original the same again 😂😂😂
YB gonna drop a hit, thank you NLE 😂

Low key fire
Woo jahnny yazew💪🏼 🇪🇹who is here to see jahnny on the music video
Youngboy don’t take you serious lil bald head
Ain’t a bad song in my opinion but definitely might be blood spilled cause of it 🤫🩸
Why they beefing?
Yb ain’t gon like this
I hate youngboy2 finna come out on that boy 🔥🔥🔥
Yb ain’t gone give this no time of day. nle knows that yb is having a run and he’s jealous and would like to profit off of it or make him respond with violence in order to take him down. The visuals and film (Masonic & Filed with vivid imagery) & beat is only to get the views up. This whole sht the song , video and lyrics is calculated asf. The lyrics r coo.. but ts ass. It’s for attention and compensation. Trying to poke the bear. This n* nle don’t know if he wanna dance , sing , be freaky , be pac, biggie or diddy. He wants to beef and speak about somebody else tearing society apart. A literal clown child. Who want to be coddled by Yb but yb see’s that’s he’s lost and will ride any wave that gets him there.
Bro just stop music and start preaching , this trash 🗑️
The best video of all time
So are you actually predicting yb death like you did xxx king von and pop smoke?
I’m ngl this was creative
What happened can someone tell me
Nle can dance I didn’t know that shhheshhhh

I was hating at first because I fw with yb music but what we not gone do is cap on the Internet and say he didn't snapped lyrically and the visuals 🔥🚒 y'all just get on here dick riding anybody lit the yb hype is overrated yes he talented but he ain't hyped to what they make him these young niggas be cock hungry for yb they don't know what hip-hop is for real all they know is opp this opp that spin this block spin dat block when 90% of that music be cap ASF I see good reviews in the comments but haters why come and give him views just to hate fr NLE do ya thang fuck dem niggas #spritualwelfare

Let's break down the symbolism: Youngboy is MJ For the longest are body been comparing young boy to Michael Jackson so what does nle Choppa done he decided to dress up like Michael Jackson in the video and dance like him, and stage design because he is considered as modern day Michael Jackson. People been comparing young boy to Tupac so what does nle Choppa do he decided do not just dress up like Tupac again and dresses up Makaveli but rap over a sample that Tupac use back in the day and on top of that what he do he intertwines both Michael Jackson and Tupac of the flow of the song.   YB gets compared to Chris Brown People also compare young boys to Chris Brown, but it's only a small few. So what does Bryson do? He also imitates Chris Brown in the song as well.  Why does nle also do it? Choppa did this because over the years, people say that he is a wannabe young boy or he's a young boy clone.  On top of that, I guess he's also making imagery that young boy is not Tupac young boy is not Michael Jackson. And what does this mean it also means that these two iconic figures are the ones that the youth looked up to positivity.  The hypocrisy of NLE He mentioned that youngboy is destroying the youth with the drugs, lyrics, etcetera, but the thing is Choppa was doing the same thing with Durk, Von, Savage, etc. I understood the message, but at the same time, it makes him look like a hypocrite for doing the same thing. We may not know what happened behind closed doors but based off a interview a while ago after the diss track dead young boy put out "Know Like I Know" NLE basically was saying he wasn't trying to go against youngboy but King Von was like a brother to him so he went with Durk to sum it up. So when he mentioned in the song he wanted peace and youngboy basically rejected it, it was more like in NLE was trying to cool it off, but didn’t.   Is this jealousy? Could this be envy from Choppa on youngboy has always gotten more recognition than him, maybe . Again, we heard several instances where people compare the two, and it's not even close when it comes to numbers and fanbase.  The controversy Choppa dressing/ imitating as Tupac. Back in 2021, he already imitates Tupac, and he has controversy. By doing that, some people praise them. Some people don't.  Video Symbolism  The black and white checkerboard and the black man looked at the Devil he basically saying that YB is the devil and he also is a slave to the system because we see the guy who's playing as YB is a slave and if you really look deeper into his tour name and his album is called Masa it's like a southern twang instead of saying Master its Masa. And guess what, who is the Masters, the industry, and let's not forget young boy for the longest been saying he want his Masters as in owning to his music a master for a master. So the video and his whole album and tour name are ambiguous when it comes to the meaning.
Bruh ion care what nobody say this shit hard AF 💯💯💯💯 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Your bsn buddy
CHOPPA BOYZ, Youngboy never broke again. Coming soon

He basically saying young boy is demonic and ruining our society and the devil is using him to do it. So he going to step in and say something because nobody else is going to. NLE is using music for the passion and NBA using his music to encourage more Tramua.

The symbolism of NLE Choppa holding YB's head at the end is so amazing. If you understand religion and spirituality, you know what that is a reference to.
This shit ass go feed them kids

Jesus is the only way
Baww fuck yu yb better

MJ CHOPPA😂🎉❤
God was speaking through NLE Choppa when he recorded this song. This is a divine song. If you know, you know. Obviously low IQ, low vibrational NBA Youngboy fans will have no idea what I'm talking about.  Kentrell Gaulden is one of Satan's Greatest Soldiers.   Just gained so much respect for NLE Choppa. Protect this man at all costs!

My young brothers get the wrapping like this. Y’all don’t even be wanting to head this type music man about time. A king was crowned God, anointed  this boy.
0:53 u don’t wanna do that bru😭
Ts ass
Why The Fuxk He Do This To His Self 😂And It's Azz Lol Wow The Clout Chase End This Young Man Career 😂

Yb better
YB STILL BETTER💚😭
A man…😂  Dammit I must be getting old Because I don’t understand  none of the lyrics anymore  But this was clearly a diss track
This is how opps ask for a handout! YB done fed this man for years, whole career surround another man. Just say you admire the man and move on. He wouldn't get one bar from me, hope this song put u back on cause ain't gon be no back and forth. Ps them YB fans/YN's unpredictable.
He wants to be PAC so bad…😂
Omg niggas do anything to stay relevant yb always gunna be on top and he never gotta change his name
I got a question what would happen if all of us black men in the game got together we would control the music scene not only that we would control the most powerful listing that the white man is using to control us our voice. We need to understand that our voice is more powerful then people with no melanin
Tupac did not die for this 😢
Naw the video 🔥 😂😂😂😂
Yb fans crying ready go to jail for life for yb😂😂😂😂
Bruh he just said anything on top of his head yb in 4
This goes hard
Wow..Game over.  NBA dont come back from this unless nle goes to the grave
YB Ignore Him Let Him Become Exhausted Weak And Lame.... YB You Dont Have To Fight Every Time Just Make Music Ignore NLE  He'll Look Like A Fool❤❤❤

This nigga been a fan 😂😭
W for the south african flag🇿🇦🇿🇦
Youngboy probably gone respond with a put a same old new orlean beats, say boom bop, make people chest pump for hours and fans gone gas it up. Anyways   This threw me off because it's real music and Nle can get away with allot of things he stepped back on that line allot of rappers got scared of who rather be ski mask hard. Nle stepped back over the line and still is hard and came hard. This is a jam all the streets listening to this
Bros reaching for attention 🤣🤧
Boy you got bodied by Jonathan majors! Stop it 😂😂

You really fan and mad that yo mans got put down! All YB beefs start from lame ash dudes like you trying to catch a buzz off his aura, that’s exactly how Von got ☠️
This what offset THOUGHT he did with the whole MJ shit, NLE REALLY went for it tho! Much better!

Nah this might’ve been the best video delivery I ever seen. But this got Illuminati written all over it. NLE never had this much delivery in his videos ever. The higher up called him to do this one. They moved Durk out the way and replaced him with NLE. Illuminati ladies and gents.
YB BETTER
This on the same level as Dolph dissing Yo Gotti😂
This some heat though lol
Who df does he think he is? Dude done fell off now he gotta use the greatest rapper of all time for clout… CANT wait fa yb ta hear this bs😂

Rip nle 😢
Giving major pain
This is the most creative video I have seen in a long time in the rap game. The spiritual awakening opening to the video, the influences he portrayed like Iron Mike, Pac, Micheal, Ali, and President Ibrahim. His delivery is very sharp, and I can understand him, unlike YB. I can never understand what he is rapping about. Just be careful and be safe NLE maneuvering now. Keep this creativity style of music going, I like it🔥.
This 🤡 got his whole image from youngboy…. Wtf
this song not bad but nle is the perfect example of being a hypocrite 😂😂😂😂
bro makes the same music talking about murder too & un positive things, yo nun but a groupie clout chaser. i cant stand hypocritical people lmao nle always been a sucka fr.
The Truth Only offends those living a lie.💯💯💯

He killed young boy. He’s too lyrical. He not touching the gray.
Bro, what the fuck is this bullshit
What has actually got into this ngaaa😭😭😭
He could have easily made a diss track that lacked creativity and shot the video in the hood on a IPhone with a bunch of YN’s holding illegal firearms 💁🏾‍♂️but he didn’t Salute. The amount of skill put into this project was incredible, not only was the song structured to perfection the visual art was amazing as well. He intentionally produced a very elegant piece of art showing all his talent in one project and I salute him for respecting the craft.
Don't care you not beating that man 😂😂

Y'all miss the whole point. He was clowning the generation. Hence the Michael Jackson dance moves. Because Yb is y'all Michael Jackson of the generation. He feel like Yb polluting the minds of the youth. So he came to fight the demons that are using Yb

Fool went crazy

How do you have so much loyalty to king Von and durk but never put nun of your homies from yo own hood on. U claim u did all this stuff but don’t have nobody around u but industry folks who is the lie u or him?
This actually is pretty profound and meaningul and i fuck w youngboy but he not necessarily the role model black men and women need. Yb a product of his environment and his music is a product of that and he may not implicitly realize it but 100s of people in our community prolly stole killed and more while playing yb and street music. Dis real spill
This corny af
😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂

I’m the type of NIA that was really inspired by the things you said on that interview you seem like he was starting to get good with God but somewhere in my spirit I felt that your spirit was not pure and what you were saying out of your mouth that’s why The man on side of you told you to keep reading the Bible when you try to describe Jesus as a brother also me watching you over the years I’ve noticed all your fake flaws and things you do for social media the gay shit and playing with God making music of this level is the same thing that you’re dissing 😮
Bruh this shit so ass why you just bury yourself in a grave again 😂😂

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
3i atlas
I’m from BR and I’m team YB all day but I love how he ain’t scared like these other rappers. I love boosie and gates but they let yb lil boy them. Anybody else diss them and they talking bout killing mommas. Yb do it and it’s “I love u lil bruda” 🤦🏾‍♂️
Just fugged up this whole sample mane damn. This video Illuminati’d out. This checkerboard 💩 annoying. Young man come to God. At least nba is independent
WTF IS THIS SHIT 😂😂😂😂
Tupac sample " hit em up" definitely a diss
Why u Diss YB lol? What he do to u
This nigga split 🙇🏾‍♂️🙇🏾‍♂️🧏🏾‍♂️🧏🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️😮‍💨🪔🪔🪔🪔 man 2Pac and Michael Jackson damn , Ali,  Bruce Lee , Mike Tyson , Prince 🫠😮‍💨😮‍💨🙋🏾‍♂️🧯💨🔥🪔. I can see yb face rn 😅
Lets not forget he tried to change his image after almost tryna kill his bm, but the gun jammed
& on top of all the hate this shit is str8 trash 🚮 😂 try again
🔥 this is something I can definitely listen too
I'm ok with him dissing yb but why u had to make the song so cringe while doing it
It’s impossible to hate on the video bc he’s portraying the world’s favorite top tier entertainers but this has to be for attention bc why u ain’t say this 4-5 years ago at the start of the yb decline and he started to be blackballed while in jail then put back on house arrest. Now that he’s back hot like fish grease u want attention. Ngl he lowkey don’t deserve a response on wax. Maybe the usual rant on IG but that’s it.
''he aint no gangsta cos his mama aint no gangsta''
Im be so serious when I say im liking this new era of NLE js hoping there gonna be a project by the end of the year 💯
Like I know part 2

Not gone lie this shit trash and good at the same time I mean I get the concept and where he going but we just really didn’t need it to me NLE best response was no response because if you was gone diss YB then u gone have to diss everybody 🤷🏾even king von and durk which is his friends so that’s picking and choosing which makes it corny🤔they all talk about the same shit and if im not mistaken durk ain’t did shit but he send people to do it 🤷🏾
He snapping low key fire
Not gone lie werid diss track yb aint even bothering you for real he literally just annouced he having a kid like whats the logic behind this
💯💯💯💯
Dax vibes
“He gon kill you”😂😂
Man what the hell 😂😂😂😂😂
Yall act like YB some super thug or something, what altercations have yall seen YB in with all this dissing, just cuz yall see him on camera snappin and all that dont mean shid, only people thinkin YB some super gangsta if these kids in high school, cuz anybody 30 and over can see right through his shid😂
YB BETTER
Man yall dudes are some str8 haters bro I hope yb don’t even respond to yo attention thirsty as. That mane on a 200million dollar tour and yall wanna dis him lol. Can’t stand all the love that man getting. 😂 the jealousy and envy is so evident
Ts genuinely ass you will never be close to tupac
Ayo f what yall saying I loved this shit lol brought back vintage vibes lol
3 years later and while he’s on tour … youn rlly want ts 😂😂😂
Is this AI??
YES !
Tupac rolling over in Cuba right now with this bs

Tuffff and I fw yb heavy
He don’t want to bang it out with yb that boy a clown he not a gangster look how his mom raised him your music is trash you fucked up a classic I can’t even listen to that song nomore
What’s makes jit think his bold head ass up on 1
I think this was wack but it’s all entertainment. Notice how it took him So long I think YB is making too much Money so of course go after who ever is winning right.
Why he got ah death row chain on 😂😂
“I’m booty d i o”🧐 what he saying
Retired my parent in my 20s now I'm 38❤️,retired, good home, bright future and it started with just a step and determination, your video reminded of the feeling I used have when I was in my lonely Journey. Keep up the good work!!!
Should had von in the thriller part if u wanted to send a message fr lol
Put me on gang..why he dissing YB lol
Yb about to drop the song of the damn year now. Thanks dude
Bro think he Tupac😂
YB must be yo daddy the way you want his attention so bad 😂
If your seeing this comment you agree this song is ass , worst diss of 2025 😂
He killed nba  that last verse imo
I ain’t gone lie I’m a YB but this hard 🔥 i hope you know you done fucked up NLE
You weren't quiet for a minute, my guy. You were quiet for years. It's crazy and corny when you see a dude clearly trying to turn his life around, and you come at him like you holier than thou bro this was creative but honestly a waste it probably would have hit harder if youngboy was on this time of time lame niggas and lame shyt always try to make a real one back track you real emotional for this one NLe dude ain't worried about you. He is a family man now, and you used to look up to him, and you gain fame rapping about the same shyt, Young Boy shouldn't reply to you directly you should just catch a stray cause you attack a man from the back when he put his sword down but didn't say shyt when he was focus on you where I'm from thats what cowards do and don't try to play tge religious/spiritual card for protection or justification, cause we all are that this was weak as hell.
who do you wanna be?😂😂😂😂this ain’t it gain who put him up to this
Bet nle choppa won’t go to Louisiana
This kid entire career is chasing YB tail around 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Y’all gassing YB 💯. This was different and tough, can’t wait to hear the response though 🫡. #KO

Thinking about how I could get revenge on YB if this ain't the most lustworthy dick riding. Oh my God

It was nice too me,  4K views in a hr.  Should have more 4sho.    Not really a young boy fan but the diss deserves a clap back.
@R34L LYF3R💙🎲: bro mad cs he didn’t have the same impact Youngboy had. even tho he made the same music as Yb did wen he was coming up. Yb is the tupac of this generation and he done that without trying to mimic him. dis dude NLE is actually trying to be tupac in order to get back poppin again and none of his stunts are working 😭😭

NLE is carrying a decapitated head as a replication of NBA YoungBoy.  Is that the best message for the youth? Sounds and looks hypocritical. 😳 disturbing.

This was a reference GOLD mine and a true piece of art that I don't think anyone in the game can keep up with. All the way from the LL Cool J reference to the Muhammad Ali , Pac , Micheal Jackson , the duality about him embracing the light and the dark with the chess board . Well played .can't forget the Africa references so fye
I fw it
Bro this is actually insane, the layers of diss in the lyrics and rapping itself makes this elite.
This is hot Garbage 🚮 it's  blasphemous too, playing with God ain't gonna help you win

Is this nba youngboy hate?
I hate that y’all turn positivity into a beef. He’s not beefing with anyone. He’s definitely referencing about the culture how things are in today’s society. He’s taking back our culture and putting positivity in where they’ve put violent and destruction in. I like what you’re doing NLE keep going 🫶🏽💜🫶🏽💜🫶🏽
YaaaaaSSSSS🙌🏾💪🏾❤️❤️❤️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Good to see my country's flag on the video ❤❤🇿🇦🇿🇦
