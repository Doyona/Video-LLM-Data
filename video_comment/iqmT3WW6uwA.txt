CHOVY < Faker  LOL WOrld cup
I can't stand Wolf b! Tc# az!!! Gen G hater 😡🤬
they meet again
Bit of disrespect to chovy, he's been the leader of GenGfor so many years, and just replaced by a former LPL player, LOL
Kind of disrespect to chovy, he is the leader of that team for so many years, yet its ruler that they chose for being, a former lpl player LoL

WE WILL MISS U PEANUT :(( ♡♡
Couldn't find the stats for the last game.
Me realizing the LCK EN casters wore their ties incorrectly. I hope it was a joke
2:24:20 Dayoung
Does anyone know what song it is at 5:26:47 when the highlights are shown?
I feel like there wasn’t enough ads. I almost watched 2 whole minutes of gameplay without interruption
Deer struggling to translate and speak at the start 😭 I love all of the LCK team they are so adorable
3:54:18 what is this noise?
Can’t help but feel like the Lucian ultimates in game 4 would wasted on zoning far too often
3:05:38 song???
how could poppy flash 2 times in that amount of time ?
I love this ban&pick bgm -final version and 4:16:15 , 4:17:18
Man Ruler is such a good jungler, what great smite control, GenG is lucky to have him
Wait. So KT ints the draft by picking Akali Trundle into Xin Zhao Taliyah. And then HLE does it again, literally a day later.  Probably the worst played GenG game in the entire LCK season, and they still won cause enemy team has no draft synergy, and the only reason they had any teamfighting ability was because they picked the most OP adc in the game.
Ban Phase is such an illusions, especially when players are just good. You can't  ban them all. Ruler will  carry with any champion. And Chovy always ends up helping his team enormously playing any champion  mid.
Its so hard to watch how HLE plays these fights, Zeka does not even ult at the 36:30 fight.

“Woori Bank” 2025 LCK Championship.  Woori Bank would have me worrying about my money.😂
We love you cronicler! Wish you the best in the future.
GEN Zeka ftw
Man, the MVP reveal 🥲
This is very sad to See Peanut such an Icon of the game retire and I wish him the best. He is a living legend of the game and of the absolute greats.
Chronicle last casting and peanut last pro play
What was with that champions lore and etc at around 00:20:00 mins?
When I was in high school, my father passed away - after this, I developed an addiction to video games.  It got to the point I would stay up all night until daybreak playing video games, and this went on for several years.  Strange thing happened though: in my 20's, I became a follower of Jesus Christ after praying to God and asking if Jesus is really His Son and died on the cross for me, and if angels and demons and all that is real.  Long story short, He showed and proved to me it's all real.  Not reaching out to judge anyone... like I said I used to enjoy these things very much.  But now I found freedom from that, joy in life rather than addiction, and surprisingly now I'm one of those people who I used to think are such weirdos: going around and telling people about Jesus haha  Inviting you to pray and ask God the same thing I did and give it a try - what do you have to lose?  -------  For anyone interested in how God proved these things to me, here is more info about experiencing His Almighty power:  After coming to Christ, I got water baptized and began to tell people about Jesus on the streets with other believers.  On several occasions, the Lord used me and other Christians I know to do supernatural things - just like it says in scripture:  -praying for people to be healed in Jesus' Name and they were supernaturally healed: injured legs to where a person couldn't walk right, sicknesses and headaches went away, etc.  -praying for people and demons manifest, sometimes speaking an evil otherworldly language, and the devils come out of the person in the name of Jesus Christ, just how it's described happening in the Bible  -believers in Christ being able to speak with a supernatural heavenly language that is not of earth (speaking in new tongues)  -also, there were times when people came to attack me when I was preaching on the street alone, and I prayed for God's protection - in one instance, an aggressive person got supernaturally pushed a good distance away when they got near me, and in another instance the angry person approaching me seemed to get 'stuck' at a certain point where something invisible was blocking them, and they couldn't approach any further  Mark 16:17-18 17 these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;  18 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.
League takes no skill
Zeus is so bad lol
que wea mas bonita ❤
01:00:48 Bite Marks 01:02:07 Here, Tomorrow  Lilith
Anyone knows the song name at 5:26:30?
Better then T1
this years lck finals production is top tier
Chronicler :( You elevated the cast because you brought so many unique qualities to the team. I wish you all the best and happiest in the future☺ GenG winning felt great, but this being your last LCK cast was just too sad :(
1:52:07 minju
Not too surprised that GEN won.  I am still at least 80% hopeful for them to win Worlds, this year.
YES, WHERE ARE THE T1 FANS SAYING THEY WOULD LOSE TO T1, THEN TO KT, THEN TO HLE 😂
i love zeus so much since 2022 but he is soooo washed up now. I'm worried he doesnt have a place among the best top laners anymore. I wonder why hes playing so poorly these days...
Peanut nutted 🥜 all over canyon this series with those smites
Why is Chronicler leaving🥲?
Lads, this team has 73% winrate (all season long) This is unreal...
Zeus sem o Faker n ganha mas 😢
2:23:32
Lucian Is a fucking bait the most useless champ rigth now and they stilla play it
cannot wait for the world championship
adc diff
Next year, the LCK will feel very weird without Chronicler..
This is incredible! I LOVE how Korea treats the LCK. You can tell how important this is
No puede ser tan malo peanut que tipo MOGOLICO
volto a dizer, ruler é o melhor adcarry de todos os tempos, merecia mais o hall da fama doq o uzi, e olha q eu acho o uzi lendario, mas todo mundo sabe q a rivalidade sempre foi faker vs ruler por 2017
worst casters. unwatchable.
OMG
Big draft gap in the first game. And if a normal viewer could tell directly that means there was a big problem.
The real LCK finals was the T1 vs GenG match somehow they made it to the loser bracket this time oh well looks like GenG is going to win everything this year
Quest "Help Ruler reclaim the LCK Title" COMPLETE! ✅
if u wanna beat Gen G u have to throw the whole kitchen sink, the house, the room, the furniture and the garden dwarves to Ruler. Otherwise u will loose
Can we just annoucne GenG as the Worlds 2025 champions already?  This year these guys are simply on top
It’s getting kind of boring to watch lck, basically anytime geng play they win, no suspense or tension.
We should just hand Gen G world trophy this year.. No team on this planet can win.. They are so strong that they nonchalantly gave HLE one freebie win as a give for Peanut.. They can end it 3-0 with one hand tie and blindfolded but they have a heart enough to give win to their fellow pro what a chad.
that was great series and end of the lck season. cheers chrony i will miss your calls “ded” farewel peanut. hope to see you as a coach.   ruler hard deserved this. imagine enemy adc is playing yunara, corki, smolder and lucian. while you go ezreal, kaisa, ziggs and xayah.
Gen G Is so lock in to that World Trophy
Damn ngl this series got me emotional. From Chroniclers last cast, Peanut’s last LCK series and the crowd cheering Ruler’s name at the end
티원이 낄 자리가 아니다 페이커 진짜못함
See ya  14th October  T1 vs IG
Boring...
SEE YOU NEXT YEAR LCK!!! SEE YOU AT WORLDS EVERYONE!!!!!
