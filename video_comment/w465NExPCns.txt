Of course they are. That's why nobody is surprised to find out that a shitty adult was never given a moral compass by their parents.
❤
"Today we are..." "High, everyone." Makes sense.
Mack is Kelsey?  Ok….  Definitely looks the same!❤
I know this is late to the game but the Irish one is a prank call, it's a middle aged man from a radio station, they do shit like this all the time!
His wife looks like that super hot dreamy actress from white lotus Alexandra daddario
9:55 chirp
My son threw his tablet out the window. That shoe video was triggering
Now the fly thing is a red flag for sure! That's gonna be one controlling psycho girlfriend/boyfriend one day 🤡
I LOVE YOU CODY I can’t believe all these foolish haters. you got the real fans we see you okayyyyeee
9:55 the ever present chirp in every single black household
9:40 - it's the Joel alarm sound of hell from the OG Epic Morning Routine vid.
Oh Cody, where do I even begin
Kody come back I’ve watched all the videossssss
Come back and make a video for my mental health. I forgive you ok man. Ok!? ❤
So he’s just gone ?😢
clearly u dont seem to think so...
10:05 the smoke detector sound makes it funnier too
Come back cody
Yo, make more vids.  I ..kinda miss you fam
Hey Cody Ko. If you're reading this during rough times, just remember: The internet and social media is not reality. It's just a revolving door for the entire world to briefly dip their toes into your life and then vanish. Also, we've all made mistakes in the past. It doesn't have to define who we are for the rest of our lives.
RIP. No more Cody lunch vids😔
no but you and elio are
FACE THE CONSEQUENCES
Terry did NOT want to hang out
didn't aged well
He dabbled with the evil
Get locked up.
He was YouTuber, she was a preschool teacher…. Could I make it anymore obvious?
I stand by Cody Ko ❤
Weird calling your main love interests evil
Diddy Diddy Diddy
His wife is so fucking mid 😭😭
Cody Ko: Are we good?
Take Accountability!!
oh this one aged like milk
u seemed to be fond of them??
0:12 Cody must be jealous
Oh no! It’s Cody the diddler, waiting for Kendrick on this one, Cody the kiddy diddler !!!
So embarassing
Are you… Evil?
You’re awesome Cody :) You’re human, you’re doing your best, i pray you find peace in these trying times of ignorance ❤
Hey hey hey, run for your life
Take accountability
I think you're evil
Poor Otis..
idk man u seem to be a big fan of them
Not evil enough for you to not be attracted to them
well well well 😂
Is Cody Ko.... Evil?
No you are 🎉
Dear Otis, I’m sorry that that man is your father…
😂
you're the actual nightmare
It was all infront of us..
This aged horribly C Diddy
I love how you can skip cody's rants by using the heatmap
Idk, but you for sure are 😂
Coward
*CHRIP*
12:57 I’ve never loved a video so much in all my life. That kid is a turd.
Cody: Shes gunna kill someone with that bat as an adult  Kelsey:noooo.....   The difference between a mother and a father 😂 love when you guys get together and make vids for us lol
That's Cody's wife? Her name is "back" p cool, i guess 🏆
the smoke alarm low battery beep at 9:52 reinforcing stereotypes
Leaving the window open that much was a rookie parent move. We’ve all done it.
My niece told me I look pretty when I'm sitting but ugly when I'm standing. I haven't stood up since.
The manipulation was so good
I think "Terry" was already deceased 😢😢😂😂😂
the kid flushing the phone down the toilet is so funny im actually crying
why
Holy shit she looks like Alexandra Daddario
Kids are just honest… my youngest asked VERY loudly in Kroger “why does that lady have so many moles all over her face?” While the lady was standing literally right behind us. Given, she did indeed have moles all over her.
"Give me a ball park figure" absolutely killed me 😂😂
I didn't realize he was named Otis lol 💀
My evil child act was basically Terry the fly. I called it making crawls though. 😅
Wait until your little one starts doing some of this, let's see if it makes you laugh when that happens,lmao good luck....lol. 😂😊
Now I'm imagining a fly taking its wings off like a coat.
PLEASE look into Mental Health's controversies, so many YouTubers endorse them despite their past with unlicensed therapists.
That's literally what hamburger helper looks like, but she's added vegetables. It just needs to thicken to one's liking.
OMG I lived in doolin, the one with the kid from Dublin with the video with doolin pier that’s my hometown! ✨ love you ☺️☺️
I used to find peanut butter baby terrifying 😭
Hi, paraprofessional here. I've seen some pretty evil things from kids. I work in the behavior room so I've seen some of the worst things that troubled kids can do. We had one student, a first grader, who became notorious for assaulting both peers and adults. To make things worse, he never saw any consequences from parents or the school because he's from a well known family who've donated money to the school. One of the teachers who unfortunately had to work with him a lot took a few days off because her dad died. I'm gonna call her Mrs. P. When she came back, this kid was back on his BS of assaulting people and peeing on the floor. Mrs. P and the teacher I work with were escorting this kid to the office, hoping that our principals would actually do something. Spoiler alert, they didn't. He was sent back to our classroom even after the next thing he did. While they were in the office, he asked Mrs. P "Are you happy?" She told him that she wasn't and she was upset with his behavior. He laughs and says "haha, you're sad cause your dad died!" None of us told him. This means his mother had to have warned him ahead of time and he freaking used it against her. This was a first grader. That was probably one of the worst things he had ever done. I have actually had nightmares about this kid.
The first one is so cute actually
16:51 perfect little face taking another bite Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
14:30 that's just what a normal body looks like especially if you ate.
4:50 that's literally torturous they have feelings...:( That freaking hurts them:(
0:00 “today we are…” “High!!!”
“Is this a demolition company or a joke factory?” 🚨 😆 That child descends from the IRA.
Why can't I see the top of his head?!!!
cody is love you man but you gotta get rid of that thing alright. it’s effecting the watch time and your numbers are lower then ever. ask yourself whats most important your career or your the guy thats barely been on earth at this point. i mean he barely even knows you bro
why are they standing
16:13 that baby big asf
When I was a child I would pull the wings off ants, I didn’t become a sociopath 😂
BITCH!!! Who??? YOU oh no not you I LOVE YOU!!! 😂😂😂 omg that was the best ever😂😂😂
i LOVE the little memes that the editor puts at the end
my first word was fuck
When I worked in a preschool, there was a little girl who was so mean to other kids. One day I asked her “why can’t you be nice to your friends?” And she said : “being nice makes my tummy hurt. I want to be like my mommy.”
As a Philadelphian I really want to know how you were able to spot the Philly accent like that???
Lmao you get more views on your second channel
Can you do a That's Cringe episode reacting to your old audition tapes?
CODYYYY YOU NEED TO REACT TO "Amish Girls See Airport For The First Time" PLEASEEEEEE
i’m not addicted to cush i’m addicted to watching cody ko while smoking cush ITS NOT MY FAULT
19:35 yo does anyone else’s like button light up when Cody says “like button”?
When my husband is snoring I just shout “SNORING!” and he doesn’t fully wake up he just adjusts.
I once babysat a little kid that told me he wanted to go live with Jesus but he didn’t want to die yet because he’d miss his mommy. I just was like “oh honey yes your mommy would miss you too”. But I was kinda creeped out.
2:50 when I was a kid apparently I would make eye contact with my mom and gag when I saw broccoli really dramatically. And I would pause to look back and make sure my mom was watching, and do it again.   I stand by it, steamed broccoli SUCKS.
i got a dre drexler ad in the middle of this video cody
the baby girls laugh when she stole her mothers phone was the definition of life and joy, i cannot get over it.
It’s very disappointing to see my favorite content creators silent during times like these.
4:30 Omg... When I was 8-10 years old I used to catch flies and tear their wings off and I'd think I made some kind of new animal species and would let it go in the grass...
My daughter, almost 5 now, on a decently regular basis reminds me that my papa is dead, he died. Granted, he passed away when she was barely 6 months but dang girl. Then she’ll say “but my papa isn’t dead. But yours is” I’m like yep those are factual statements lol thanks for the daily reminder my grandfather is long dead & I don’t get to see him ever again lol. Being a parent is a wild reminder that we have to learn these things as we grow older, MOST of the time kids aren’t saying things to hurt us it’s just a fact in their brain and they have zero concept of what it means lol
My five year old niece told me "youre fat just like my mom if u wore the same clothes you would look like twins"   And one time she gave me an m&m chocolate and had an evil smile on her face when she did , i thought it was sweet, so i said thank you and ate it It tasted like it had been in her mouth before😂  And my older niece said "you didn't see her put it in her mouth and then it fell on the floor huh?" 😂 And they both laughed 😂   Another time the five year old was sharing her chips with me and said something sweet, i told her "aw you're so cute"  And she responded with " DON'T TELL ME THAT OR I'LL TURN YOU EVIL" ... I was like wtf scared af 😂
Mom in the black dress is a baddie, ngl!
PLEASE DO A VIDEO REACTING TO RING CAMERAS AGAIN!!!!
It seems like Cody doesn't burn.
I find children to be so hilarious. Ill own up to it, i was an evil child lol. I remember once as a kid i was maybe around 6 or 7, my mom came home from work one day and i looked and my babysitter at the time and told her something along the lines of her services are no longer wanted. This grown woman litrrally burst out into tears and i got put into time out. The end.
Answer: no. They are dumb.
Bro doesn’t burn
You should review the kids tv game show what would your kids do.
Otis is such a great name.  I love names that aren't common but are actual names ❤️
Cody!!! I have a question!? The old interview of you talking about the app that generated memes? Was it the one with:  “I want to tongue punch your fart box” 😅😂 I need to know this!
7:10 sounds like a prank call with a voice filter
"sorry kelsey left early, but you still got me !" mom & dad fr
When our daughter was 4yrs old she flooded our ENTIRE house, requiring us to replace the flooring, drywall, baseboards and ground cabinetry, as well as most of our furniture in all 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, the living and dining rooms, the foyer, and part of the kitchen and laundry room. Insurance did cover some of the damages, but it honestly may have been cheaper to just sell the house as is, take the loss, and buy a new house. How did she manage to do this while both of us were home? Well, I was on my death bed with pneumonia, which put me in the hospital the day after this catastrophe. I was asleep because of how incredibly sick I was. This required my husband, who works night shifts, to stay up and take care of her. After about day 3, he was exhausted and accidentally fell asleep while watching cartoons with her. So, she decided to fill the bathtub and have a "pool party" with her barbies, monster high dolls, and my collection of vintage smurf figurines. I promise we are not bad parents, and our daughter was/is NOT evil! Fever and sleep deprivation lead to accidents and questionable decisions. But thank God our daughter was completely unharmed.
Your wife seems so funny and pretty
LOL the irish girl one
NEED you to do a milf manor season 2 episode like ASAP PLS
hellow all people
The goblin is back!!!
Day 2 asking for Milf Manor Season 2
I loved this. We did the cuss word pass with our kid around age 4 and they said "shut up". We curse constantly and they definitely know worse than that. But they knew that saying shut up would to someone would actually get them in trouble. Whereas anytime they have said a curse we just remind them they are grown up words.
you know anything abt joost klein?? He wrote a line abt you once and you reacted to it he’s blowing up right now with his eurovision performance
There is a season 2 of milf manor, need a video ASAP chodester!!
FREE 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
I love thag Kody implies if his son insults him he will disappear for 6 months
Watch out for that kid from Dublin 😂 bro is a menace
Milf manor season 2 is out, please react to it
Milf manor 2 is back! check it out it's supposed to be even worse than last time
Can’t you guys at least upload 3 times a day so I can have breakfast, lunch and dinner with my YouTube parents? I shouldn’t be this depressed but I am and binging you two together makes me happy so thanks.
Imagine Otis watching his parents stay silent about a genocide.
Yo Cody I doubt you'll care, and judging by the reddit environment I know the majority of your audience doesn't gaf. But I've been following since 2018, and I know you're a comedy youtuber so it doesn't seem like your place, but others like Kurtis Conner have finally managed to speak up asking for aid for Palestine. There's a genocide going on right now, and everyone always says they'd be doing things to help during the holocaust and other points in history, but what you're doing right now is what you would have done back then. Keeping the status quo to keep controversy low is your choice, and it's disappointing to me that you wouldn't mention anything about it, even though a request for donations could make a huge difference with your follower base.  I'm going to unsubscribe, I know that doesn't matter but I hope eventually you change your mind about choosing to remain silent. You have the power to make a difference.
I like being able to watch videos that I haven’t seen before and I’m always giggling 🙂‍↔️🤭
That little girl phone-goblin will be crouch-walking around her house when she's older. All alone saying to herself "I'LL BE HAVING THAT!"
Cody, please, I have a REALLY important request!! You NEED to watch Milf Manor 2!!! I'm begging! The plot twists, the drama! It's better than ever! Please please please!
me and my little brother would tear off the wings of flys cuz the slow and dumb ones were at the windows 😭 im sorry
CODY KO... you're the worst cody ever... cody is a better cody than you are. but the name otis is actually really cute.
The kid gagging at the hamburger helper was me as a kid lol. The smell of that with peppers cooking makes me sick to my stomach. Plus it’s all watery lol. The mom saying “it looks delicious!” Is delusional lol 😂
are kids evil but its just a clip of otis taking kelsey from the video
we want kelsey back
The guy who got punched for snoring was genuinely hurt by that baby punch 😂😂
@Cody Ko You might wanna look into your sponsor BH, there seems to be a controversy about them
My sister did the same thing with flies… we called them “walks” :(((((((
oh how nice, better wealth scammers ads??? really??? u just want to screw up your channel?
i used to work as a pre-school art teacher and one time one of the kids had a sticker and kept sticking it and unsticking it on my hand and then she told me "yk what my favourite colour is? it's red because it's the colour of blood" while she kept sticking and unstinting the stickers she told me that she wanted to see my blood 💀 i quit shortly after
scottish kids are so funny
I just lost my aunt today after a 10 month battle with leukemia. I’ve drank too much but just wanted to say your videos never fail to make me laugh out loud. Thank you Cody
wanna know something i can’t wait for is to see how they raise a child and see how the child turns out because it is kind of like a science experiment with having different parents. and when theyre in different media attention yk ? but yeah so hope to see yall see in many years ! baha
you’re holding us hostage to part 3 of my fat obnoxious husband cody
more tinder nightmares!!!
Hey @codyko when are you going to start using your platform to talk about the G3n0c1de happining in G4z4, C0ng0 and Sud4n ? I know that you care about the less fortunate - you‘ve shown that multiple times. Using your platform to stop these humanitarian crisies would really mean and do something!
I came here specifically for Kelsey 🤬
13:52 dude started speaking telepathically
😭
I see something on his head but it's hard to tell...damn camo
cody. i doubt you will see this but for the last month for surre maybe longer i have not been pushed your videos at all it seems like your shadow banned from my feed at least i tried to un sub and re sub to fix it but i figured i would let you know hope it helps if there is any issue <3
This needs a part 2 and maybe Kelsey will stay 😂
5:03 *sigh* feed your family bro. Good on you.
The kid calling the demolition company to blow up the school was an 8 year old girl who liked to make prank calls lol
Post Big Fat Obnoxious fiancée Bro me and my girlfriend have been tying to eat for 8 weeks
Cody……milf manor……it has a season 2. Do what you must
CODY GIVE US THE DOGS WE WANT TO SEE THE DOGS LET THEM OUT IN A VIDEO DAMNIT
Cody thinks kids are evil?
OTIS???????
Cody Milf Manor has a S2!!!
Please GOD start doing reviews for MILF Manor S2
I also used to rip wings off of flies when i was little
MILF MANOR 2 IS OUT, YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS
When Milf Manor season 2 react???
hey can someone lmk what happens after kelsey left? 👋🏼
9:31 ILL BE HAVING THATTTT
Like Kelsey said, kids copy. I don't think the kid @11:30 is manipulative. Sounds like they see repeat fighting. Person gets called a bitch, they go to leave, other party says where you going. This kid doesn't have the same intent and that is most likely why the readily accept the reply.
Yup that one kid is a master manipulator, and soooo young too wow
OH MY GOD. cody talking about kids putting rat poison in their sister’s coffee reminded me of how i ACTUALLY put BLEACH in my stepmum’s coffee when i was like 8. I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IT WAS WRONG. As a kid, i definitely would score more than a 3 on Kelsey’s evil kid scale
Oh, kids can definitely learn the context of words over time. My mother likes to tell the story of how she had a habit of saying, "up the ying yang," a lot and that when we were shopping one day she commented how the prices were expensive and I replied back, "up the ying yang?" She was surprised since at the time I was a toddler who barely spoke who was never told what "up the ying yang" meant.
Next time let kelsey finish the video
For everyone saying the kid at 7:20 is a voice changer, it's a real little girl who worked for 98fm in Dublin, her name is Rebecca Barry (not Saoirse Ronan lol) and she was a child actress who did over 200 of these prank calls for the show.  She was obviously given lines to say, but she is really a child.
As a young parent, watching these with Cody and Kelsey is so awesome!
Everybody knows that the kid version of a woman is a girl, and the kid version of a man is a dude.
Cody is looking like a truck driver 😅😅
Hey Cody, there are plans to log the Moose Mountain trail area. Not sure if you’ve ever been out there but it’s beautiful. Maybe you could help us out and share this petition: https://chng.it/9mzdgbLYY2 (labelled “stop the tree harvest of West Bragg and Moose Mountain on change.org”)
Cody. Can you bring back That's Cringe with Noel. I don’t think I ever laughed this hard in my life.
chop chop youtube boy where’s our met gala review
The most evil thing in this video is you playing the alarm sound
Can you pleaseeee do "7 strangers decide who wins $1000"
Met gala looks with Kelsey 🙏🙏
You could just stop taping and pick back up when Kelsey returned.. Jeez...
Help your wife it’s your son to fam. I indeed stopped watching from there
“what do we say the most?”  Miranda Crosgrove: “…prolly Fuck”
PLEASE finish the my obnoxious fiancé series I check in to see if you’ve released it regularly , thanks
Been gone for a while so I know I'm late on the song, but that shit is a banger.   *downloads immediately*
3:49 😂 this one was my favorite in this episode, me muerooo
I laughed 😊
13:53 cody speaks telepathically
Pleaseeee do a met gala review with Kelsey!!!
i NEED a reaction video on jojo siwas dating show RIGHT NOW CODYY
Having your toddler say swear words is not cute. When she grows up to be trashy and can't stop herself from cursing all the time, will the mom remember she encouraged it? Will she even care?
After an excruciatingly long work day i stopped in the corner store to grab snacks and whatnot, walked to the line, and stood behind a family. This little girl looks me dead in my soul and says " i lit my house on fire" then puts her finger over her mouth to shush me, and turned back around. X,D
unit 731
i can't wait until otis is old enough to send old man cody some jumpscare videos !
will you not continue the "my obnoxious fat fiance" series? D:
2:39 Having lived in Philly for 13 years, I will say I very much agree with you if it’s not, I would be very surprised. I love that accent so much.❤❤
When Kelsey is hungover without makeup and talks, I’m slightly afraid the right side of her face is gonna slide off
when Kelsey left, I felt like the mutual friend left
Wasn't expecting such a short video (only 6:25?), but I still appreciate the lunch entertainment while it lasted.
NOT YOU GUYS VICTIM BLAMING TERRY 😭😭😭
"They don't wanna watch the world burn they just wanna watch a croc fly in the wind"
COOOODDEEE 🚨 there’s milf manor season 2 out now 👀✏️
HAS ANYONE SEEN THE NEW HARRIS TEETER COMMERCIAL WITH A GIRL THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE KELSEY!!?❤❤❤
Man that last child is starting his Christian Cage arc lmao 😂
On Friday, one of my students came into my office and randomly hugged me and said “you look sad today, I hope you feel better” 😭 for context, I’m a band director and that 7th grader isn’t technically my student, she just saw me during my conference period and she thought I needed a hug LOL
This one kid straight up pissed on me when I was 11 he was like 8 but days later I saved him from a burning car luckily I wasn’t evil.
pls do a met gala fashion review again!! i loved those!!!!
I remember when I was like idk 3, I was at my aunts, the family was just sittin' there and my cousin glances out of the room to see me sprinting from right to left with the tv remote and you bet he fuckin' knew what my sole intention was, when the kitchen window was wide open. The thing is, idk why, but at that time I thought the remote was gonna come back, like a boomerang... Well it didn't.
you guys should roast peoples refrigerators again
Oh mylanta the Irish kid damn near took me out lol.  I'm sure you know this already Kody but the uhhh.. the MILF Manor show is back... 🤣
Hey Cody, could you explain to me the difference between your 2 channels? I’m new
ngl I’m back after a week after leaving when Kelsey left, here to watch the rest since it’s 2am with nothing better to do
The bay throwing bottle at other baby to wake him up ..is how my son woke me up every morning .He had a perfect aim and get me right on my eyebrow bone faithfully!
I definitely was an evil child. I wanted to squeeze small animals. That phase is why if i ever have kids I'm NEVER leaving them alone with an animal because now that i look back, that was very concerning behavior
Otis isn’t evil, YET. He’s plotting, trust.
kelsey’s glowing 🤩
When worked at a pre-school I was on the floor playing with blocks with one kid. Just building and chilling. He gets up and walks over to the window and looks outside for a lil bit and walks back over to me, stares at me dead in the eyes then coughs directly in my face. He then proceeds sits down and goes back to building like he didn’t just do that… I was just disgusted more than anything.
I missed goblin Cody
1:49 "mothafucka! Hehehehehhehehhe" 😭😭😭😭😭😭
0:04 HI
I think 7:55 sounds like a voice changer tbh🤔
I used to coach children figure skating and one day one of them come up to me and my friend and said “you’re young and skinny” to my friend.. then looked at me and said “and you’re young and fat” right in front of her mother.. and the MOTHER just LAUGHED.. bruh
The fit goes so hard in this!!!!!
worst ending ever. watching this with my older sister and she threw me at her phone. 0/10.
MILF Manor 2, Cody?
When I was a kid I thought sexy meant cute, so one time I put on an outfit and said, "I look sexy."
Why no piss drawer?
the kid from dublin was someone using a pitch shifter
From experience, Terry did not want to hang out. From a traumatised nanny that's had a wingless fly been thrown in her hair
dont EVER put Kalsey in the Thumbnail when she isnt in the entire video. Let it be a warm surprise, not a sad dissapointment.
“was it a dude or a girl” is my new favorite thing
The kid that took all the labels off the cans is gonna be having some gnarly food combos for the next month 😂
Cody we need to kick the bethelp sponsor
Terry identified as a walk - he wanted those wings gone 😌
I felt for the woman trying on her dress. She had a good time, but that little comment hit home, you can just see it in her eyes. But I wouldn't call that evil, kids just don't have a filter of hat they can and can't say to other people yet
Love you Cody but I have to admit I scrolled forward to see if Kelsey was gonna come back :/
I love having Kelsey in Cody's vids, she's actually so sweet and watching their chemistry is so cute omg
please react to supermarket sweep
Yayyy its my favorite time of the day!! Getting insanely high and watching my favorite couple laugh!!
Um Cody Milf Manor is back…
Why are two still friends with a grapist?
The Irish one is a prank radio show gag. They’re just using a voice changer. I’ve seen other videos from the same show.
4:35 NO WAY! When i was a kid i also pulled the wings off a fly to keep it as a pet lmao
pls read r/childfree
i would teach swim lessons to kids and when my acne a bad a little girl asked why my face was so dirty😭 she also would put her head underwater when i would tell her what to do and told me my voice was annoying
One time this random kid at a playground started playing with me and my friends and she told me to go last down the slide because i was the ugliest 😢
14:35 That video of the lady in the dress always gets me. I can’t help but laugh but I feel so bad for her. I’ve never seen someone’s will break like that.
“Today we, HI IM BACK!”  Kelsey made this video. Sorry Cody, she’s what we’ve been waiting for 😂😂😂. (Love you Chodey, you’re the GOAT frfr)
Why was this uploaded here and not codyandko it seems like a codyandko video
Today you are high by the way?
12:04 this reminds me of when my mom walked in on my 2nd oldest brother(toddler) and my older sister(baby, 10 months) and he was spraying her in the face with Lysol when they were younger lol
Came for the piss drawer, no piss drawer
petition to get Cody to remix the peanut butter baby's "ah" into his music
i was so disappointed when he didn't say "I'll be having that" while reenacting the phone goblin. i was waiting for it. i was so excited. i was ready to yell it with him. but alas...
I feel like otis' first words are gonna be goblin noises
Milf manor 2!!!!!!
I'll be honest, when kelsey left I almost did too😭😭
i had my hair in a slick back ponytail and i was told by a little girl that i looked bald, i love the honesty!!
Kelsea being on the thumbnail is a scam. CLICKBAIT CODY
i did in fact leave when she left
I genuinely don’t think I’ve cried laughing to one video as much as this 💀
One time I had a kid ask me if I was sick because I didn’t wear makeup that day, and then asked me to wear makeup because she likes me better with it I was so humbled
Can ya talk about gambling at Dave and Busters
I wish someone would take an eyelash off my face and tell me to make a wish…
they got peanut butter baby!!!
Imagine Cody being ur dad that’d be sick you’d legit be laughing as soon as u came out the womb
Haven't watched your videos in a couple years, but seeing the dynamic/relationship with Kelsey now its clear you guys are only loving and appreciating each other more as time passes. Makes me happy to see!
almost saw cody’s foot fungus
That one kid wants to blow the world up... literally
I have 16 month old twins and I bought your "Who Let Me Have Fun" sweatshirt and one the twins has learned to say "star" because of it :,) I wear it pretty often and he will point to one of the starts and say "dah" so thank you for that
As another early ed teacher turned stay at home toddler mom, I love kids so much and they are also gremlins and kind of the worst. But like in the best way.
Kids will humble you real quick.
once Kelsey left I just kept looking at her empty spot next to Cody wishing she'd reappear all of a sudden... sorry Cody ig
that poor woman tho. "you look like you're starting to get pregnant" like nah girl your mom just has a womb
my waffle knit parents
I caught flies at around 8 because I saw how my dad did it. So maybe the child caught it? For those who don't know the trick is to wait for the fly to sit somewhere, then get your hand slowly close to her preferably with the fingers a little open so you don't push wind on the fly and then when you feel you are close enough, you close your fingers and you make a rapid movement to catch her a little upwards and towards the way its facing.
7:10 This kid gonna grow up to be the Riddler one day. 💀
My kid got a quesadilla stuck to the ceiling today. On purpose. Yes they are evil.
Why you not friend with Noel anymore?
please come to my wedding. booze and fun.
10:56 It sound like kid said “well… you” but I think he said “and I love you” aww
The funniest part of the baby slapping the snoring dad was the mom from what I could tell said "Dozo" in Japanese afterwards which means "There you go!" so basically just encouraging the slap hehehe
One time my mom asked my little brother if he thinks she’s skinny and he said “well you do have a lot of skin”
“Give me a ball park figure” has me in absolute stitches 😂
Terry is now a walk lmao
peanut butter baby AHH is my favorite
14:10 when I worked at a daycare, a girl I had never met before passed me in the hallway and asked "do you have a baby in your tummy?".  I did not.
Tearing off the flies wings is actually horrible… :/
Please don't do an Irish accent. It hurts my soul.
i think kelsey left to go give birth i think
god I’d love to see the analytics of people dipping from the video at the  6:27 mark
Kelsey is glowing ✨
Stop supporting Better Health.
Restock merch plz
1:46 at this exact moment I thought, "wouldn't it be funny if this kid just came out with the 'motherfucker'" and OH MY GOD
I’m gonna start a band called “devastated on a Sunday morning”
I came for the piss draw... disappointed
my little brother would pull the wings off flies. he'd also pull off just the legs so they'd fly around and not be able to ever land without rolling
no, I want mommy >:(
why did i actually feel like clicking off 😂no offense cody.
Wow, Kelsey's husband held up well without her
Second season of MILF manor just started! GET ON IT! 😀
Otis is definitely evil
I was upset the one with sister blew the Candle and the birthday girl beat he ass and she was smirking
im loving the thermals so much
Otis I think I’ll forever hold a bitterness in my heart towards you for taking away what could have been a 20 minute video with Kelsey.
Your outfit says Maga
My first job was as a camp counselor. We had one kid who lied about another kid attacking her with a knife (in reality she accidentally cut herself), we had a kid who would have frequent meltdowns and the only thing that would stop them is if we asked her if she wanted to see a trinket (like a toy or rock or other small object), and then on my last week i was in the martial arts camp and we had several incidents (obviously). The worst was this one kid who would always grab these hand held punching bag things and put them on and swing at people --- he ended up giving another kid a nosebleed because he hit him in the face. And there was this other kid who at one point hit another camper, and then said he did it "accidentally... on purpose" which is honestly real but we could not control him. The biggest issue is that I wasn't trained to handle kids like that (or at all --- they hired me late despite needing workers and said I'd learn on the job). And the saddest thing is that some of the kids were very clearly being told fucked up things by their parents or trusted adults. The girl who cut herself and lied about it also told one of my coworkers that she (the camper) was crazy/messed up.
Make a part 2
I have a hot take, cody is the star of the show!!!!!
I work at an afterschool and have watched kids rub dirt into people eyes for genuinely no reason
At 18:05, is that the same family where the two girls are sitting at a table and keep telling their mom there's something in the laundry room and then scream bloody murder at nothing...
10:54
"We should go get him..."  Lol Kelsey is just gone. Ifeeeeel a little like they couldve paused together..but ey. What do I know I'm a 33 year old single not mom so I'll take my exit
Mack, woman YOU have thee most gorgeous eyes on this _whole_ platform, wowzers!! 💕💕
inherently, they are when you take into account the fact that social structure is just like having bumpers for bowling. They want to find out what they CAN do, not what they SHOULD do, so you end up with kids doing real "dickwad type beat" behavior and it pisses of adults, especially the ones who are like, yo, correct your child, it's not my responsibility
Can you do a fashion review with Kelsey again plssss
The side eye homegurl gives her fat mom is fkn hilarious.  Same mama same
Does anyone know what hoodie that is he has on?
My niece pinned down a fly and cut its wings off then came up the me and said “look uncle it’s a WALK” lmao
9:24 - "I'll be having that" vibes
Could you please use chapters for sponsors so I can skip it in a single click? Why wouldn't you want to make skipping the sponsor easier?
may i just state you missed an opportunity 11:55 ''i love you'' ''idk... do you?''
New milf manor 2 just dropped yesterday it’s crazy you gotta bring that series back
NAILED the Philly accent
Honestly I thought about leaving when Kelsey left. But I stayed I took pity in Cody.
I left as soon as Kelsey left
i wore makeup one time and a kid i work w looked and me and said “why did you draw your eyebrows with sharpie” LMAOO
Cody!!! Start up milf manor season 2!
c'est drôle
I’m a TA at a preschool and my name is pickle to all the kids
I love how there are inside jokes with Cody and his audience, like if someone else watched for the first time, they would have no clue about the depth of the jokes being passion, goblin, or foodie.
18:09 enraged me lmfao that poor mom
I miss Kelsey
another fantastic lunch break watch, thank you Cody and Kelsey
we deserve a refund of 13 minutes and 86 seconds
Kody is so innocent for believing the Irish kid clip is real. You can clearly hear the voice is generated.
I don’t even have to watch this to answer that question, wait til yours is 2 😅 then 6 😂 then 8 😭
When I worked with kids I would draw things they asked and one asked for Ben 10. I drew the first shows design cuz I forgot it got rebooted and he asked why I didn’t draw what he asked. I said that “when I was a kid Ben 10 looked a bit different” and without even letting me finish explaining he blurted “you mean it was in black and white?” I had recently turned 23 then 😂
My husband is a kindergarten english teacher. There's one kid in his class who accidentally wet the bed at nap time, and a little psycho came and asked him, "Can I smell it?" 😂
holy shit this one had me crying lmao thank you i needed a good laugh
this was a good lunch break
oh is that why your car ran out of gas. son threw croc out the window im sure. had to double back and ran out
Ah fuck this isn’t gonna become a parenting channel now will it?
kids just being brutally honest
I heard peanut butter baby still smells like peanut butter to this day
Not me watching this on my dead dad’s birthday 😭 18:36
I used to work part time at a daycare in highschool and this one girl maybe 2 or 3 didn't know my name so she just called me "the pretty lady" and that sticks with me to this day
Kids are raised by one parent nowadays is a huge issue. Or worse raised by daycare and school
The kid he said I love you where you going hahaha your not a b**ch lol
"I'll give bites,  but I excpect bites"
I'm a bit confused, what happened to the top of Codys head in this videos? Like sometimes I can see it just fine, like when he's fixing his hair, and then it just gets like cropped off again!
I love how he still says phhassioon like 6 years later
It's a shame content this good and regular is sposored by the israeli toxic company known for it's controversies... get yo money but at better places king plz
"today we are, high"
15:43 is it just me or is this baby faking huge??? It's like almost as big as the mother
4:32 my little sister did this to flies for the opposite reason. at my grandmas house there was always flies sitting on the windowsill, so my little sister would rip their wings and their legs off and watch them suffer because she found them annoying. I once saw her doing mini fly surgery
my older brother used to catch house flies & rip their wings off to play w/ them as well🥲🫠
The "who did this?" is giving hotdog sketch from i think you should leave
U SHOULD DO TIER LISTSSSS OR ICEBERGSS
My mother is a teacher, has never as long as I’ve known her, and I couldn’t tell you how many times she’s said “the kids are the problem, it’s the damn parents”
I think it was a little girl on the phone not a boy !
I'm a little over the halfway mark, when does Kelsey come back guys
i used to rip wings off of flies and ladybugs. not proud of it, but its honest work
The pregnancy one reminds me of the time my friend told a story about some lady asking her if she was pregnant and my autistic child self candidly responded with "well you aren't exactly skinny" because, well, she wasn't 😭 obviously I should not have said that shit but I was 11 and had autism brainrot
You can easily put flies and other insects like that in a fridge and they will enter hibernation because they're cold blooded. After they're "asleep" you can take them out of the fridge and they'll revive after a while. I'm guessing that's how the kid did it.
PLEASE DO COUPLES CRINGE of your old vines !!! co videos has some of them just of you !
kelsey looks so incredibly stunning
"Starting to get pregnant" is the most innocent child way of fat shaming.
Having just you is better than not having either of you 🙂
🙂excellent. You get a like and a smiley face from me.
cody what is that jacket youre wearing
When I was a kid, I told a pregnant lady at her baby shower that her legs were getting fat.
My niece is 2 and loves to imitate me, when I pick up her brother and groan bc he's heavy, she does a little mocking groan too and she thinks it's so funny
The people need milf manor 2 content
speaking of kids being menaces; recently my nephew smeared his poop all over the house and ate it, again...
what do you guys think cody smells like
CODY YOURE A MONSTER, HOW DARE YOU THROW AWAY TWO LIVING LOBSTERS, THE OCEAN IS RIGHT FREAKING THERE BROTHER MAN....c'mon lmao
14:20 she looks damn good, why’d the kid have to do her like that.
You're right I only came for Kelsey...was disappointed but stayed
Please do more with Kelsey
14:31 SEE PROOF GIRLS ARE TRAINED TO BE PSYCHOLOGICAL MENACES FROM BIRTH that woman was ABSOLUTELY feeling beautiful only for her little demonspawn to DESTROY her self-esteem.... man i hope she's aight cuz she looks FINE as hell to me.
9:59 LOL that look at her mother, the narrow slanted eyes sayin like "bish, really? you need me to spell it OUT for yo fat@ass???" but then she turned the oven up on the cooker and fully ROASTED HER i'm surprised the chair didn't break down in laughter n fall apart
9:21 LMFAO that is the most sinister lie and laugh that is absolutely hysterical bwahahaha
at the end of 8:00 i feel like that's a prankcall with a voice changer or an extremely high IQ child.
off topic during the sponsor segment; i just wanna say your woman looks absolutely AMAZING in motherhood my man. i'm so glad she's back in videos.  she looks so happy and healthy and good.  i'm super happy for the both of you and i  can't wait to start hearing stories of your journey into parenthood. i'm sure the combo of your genetics will create one of the funniest little humans in the world ^_^
4:10 - 4:12 o sweet cody, do you know anything bout spanish parents LOL
2:23 that's not evil, that's HIGHLY INTELLIGENT counter-measures. lmfao  i'd be proud depending on age.  i don't believe in grounding though, it does not work. spankings on the other hand DO WORK.
1:50 this poor innocent sweet child has a 304 for a mother where she brings in a new "man" every other week or so and they treat her so badly that all this child hears is this man yelling and cussing at her and possibly beating her.... i'm kinda sad even tho you guys find it cute..
ah, the nature vs nurture argument
One of my kids that I work with said to me “Sorry Miss Bri, I’m gonna break your arm” … he’s 4
If there’s a bad kid, there’s more than likely a far worse parent responsible for bringing them up.
That third video made me gag, I had to cover it with my hand
it was so nice of Kelsey to let her boyfriend have some screen time and take over the video while she left, he’s kind of funny maybe he should start his own channel
one time i was outside with my family and i was probably 3 or 4 and i realized i had never seen my dad cry so i started throwing rocks at him to make him cry. kids just have the biggest curiosities and they dont care about who gets hurt they just want to see things happen
I was watching my two very young sons at the time playing a game and I said  ‘you guys are great at this game!’ And I was met with “you’re embarrassing dad!” Followed by “yeah! You’re annoying!” Needless to say my soul was crushed.
Kinda disappointed that he didn’t make the “ill be having that” joke abt the phone goblin vid
I have scars from stitches above my right eye cause my sister threw a sippy cup at me when I was a baby while I was sleeping. I was told I was less than impressed by it.
As someone who works with children fuck all the commentary said was spot on and hella funny 😂
I think you are the only couple on YouTube that I can stand. 😂
why are you edging us with kelsey leaving, cody?
Can you do a whole video on how some chiropractors are just scammers that cause EXCRUCIATING pain??
these are so funny.
Cody is dressed like Rob Dyrdek in this one ngl
Please do the series 🙏 in particular episode 4. Extremely disturbing but I’d love to see your analysis
Glad to see Kody has a doble chin too🤭
To be fair when I was a kid I caught flys that were buzzing on my window and id pull their wings off and i put like 9 of them in a little container to keep as pets and when i checked on them they had all died (obviously) and I cried
Is the ply wall set in its final form
ANOTHER TINDER NIGHTMARES
One of the best videos in a while 😂😂😂😂, if only you said “I’ll be having that” it would have been a perfect Cody Ko video 😂
The Clean My Room little girl. I would have told her to go clean it yourself butthead. Lol
In the clip with the little girl about to smack her big brother until she noticed she was being recorded,  they had Fox's pizza on the stove.  Is that a known brand. I always thought it was a regional thing. I've never seen it outside of the area in central PA.
love you cody but you owe us another video with kelsey soon i literally said NOOOOOO out loud when u said she wouldn’t come back
I don't know why but hearing that little kid with such a heavy British accent blew my mind. Idk why, I guess I was like, "Yeah they're normal as kids but then they grow up and become British." 💀
7:55 oh kid....I'm 26 and sometimes I wish that I have the power to blow my faculty, I guess we're not that different huh? 😅
Wild to watch Cody and Kelsey do the eyelash make a wish thing because my husband and I do the same thing lmaaaoo like looking in a mirror expect y’all are hotter and Cody you’re so much taller
13:52 I’m starting to think Cody is being replaced by AI
Cody should start a company called bettorhelp. Where he helps people become better gamblers
I love when Cody makes a new song, because then we get a new outro song
I worked in a preschool for five years. One day had a kid hugging me she looked up at me and said "you have a big belly like mommy🥰" and it was cute but once had a harder kid ask for help I got down to her level and she said "why do you smell like an outside dog" 💀 bruh
i liked when he tried to do the irish accent and just went straight back to american
4:57 is a fly with no wings called a walk?
honestly really glad i have an answer for all the random shoes i’ve seen on the highway throughout my life
someone get cody out of this damn b*tter h*lp contract
I remember this kid at a park with his skater parents came up to me and told me I was beautiful. He was like 5 and it meant a lot to me.
I mean when I was 5 ish I told my mom "your boobies are flat and pancakey" and I swear to god I'm not a mean person I think kids just don't have a sense of what's insulting to say 😂
11:02 this kids gonna be a master manipulator when he gets older 😂😂😂 he did a whole 360, and gaslit you into thinkin he loves u and ur not a bitch like he jus called u 5 seconds ago. 😂😂 kids are crazy man lol
You owe the people a Kelsey video
I'm a man who's been told to smile probably more than any woman has and no one stands up for me
My older brother “washed” my grandma’s car with a rock when he was little.
in terry’s defence, when i was that age, i too used to catch flies and pull their wings off so we could hang out 😭
I was so tempted to leave when Kelsey did
omg cody how can u review evil babies without the video of the two girls where the friend BLEW OUT THE BIRTHDAY GIRL'S CANDLE and put on a very sinsiter FACE by the END!! anyone else know the video im talking about??? its was viral on every social media a few years ago omg i can still remember it vividly
i love you cody and kelsey🫶🏼
Pretty sure the "horror movie" clip at 18:03 is Rob Dyrdek's wife and daughter. lol
@18:03 was mutuals with that girl on tiktok, her little sister was crazier than that video but so so so funny. the girl did lose her account tho shortly after going viral viral, think 50 cent posted her on his ig too
As a kid, I used tear the wings off from flies and build them lego houses
"ball part finger" is the funniest thing i've heard this whole entire week
Cody why didn’t you say I’ll be having that about the phone goblin child 😔
K: "We should go get him" C: "Okay, go get him" Damn Cody. That's cold.
that outfit is nasty
4:35 so is Terry just called a walk now?
Reminds me of last week when my niece told me my stomach was too soft, and keeps bringing up size every day now 😢
I used to do the fly thing :x
The house fly just wanted to say rip to terry
I was a fairly good kid but I guess some things I did that could be considered "evil" would be telling complete strangers who had tattoos that they were gonna die (i was under 5 years old when i did this, i guess i thought the tattoos were like poisoning them lol where i got this idea i have no idea). Also telling my kindergarten teachers my mom buried my dad in the backyard. They almost called the police but a family friend worked in the school and cleared this up. He is still alive, i just dont know him because he didnt want me. Anyway i dont know where i got this idea, my mom thinks i just overheard and misheard a conversation she was having, i also didn't realize what i was saying at that age and thought it was a funny story.
listen, i love your content, but lately idk abt these thumbnails i feel like they’re getting less and less “click worthy” especially this one, it looks very plain they just lack a reason to click it, a reason to differentiate it from other videos, youre vids are great and very entertaining but i think these newer thumbnails need work (mostly your second channel)
Fry Cosplay
i used to catch insects and take off their wings and legs 😂😂
I lost motivation to watch this video when Kelsey left
Wish I knew what happens after 5 minutes
My little brother said he had plans to murder me as a child lmao he was a bit of an evil child I would say (much love)
When I was like five, I was at my brother's baseball game with my dad, and I grabbed my dad's hand and dragged him over to a random group of moms that was talking and  I very loudly said   "This is my dad, he divorced my mom" honestly I thought I was the best little wingman.
I love the vids with Kelsey I feel like I’m just chillin with y’all
lmao the Irish kid sent them a blueprint and a hitlist
so nice of kelsey to let her husband make the rest of the video
Cody looks and sounds like a really great dad 🥹. Makes me want to call mine ❤
The Irish one was a radio show segment im pretty sure. The host had a voice changer on.
Hiiii Kelsey!!!
So nice of Kelsey’s husband to finish the video🥰
just gotta say as a mom, I did the bathroom swearing thing for my kids and they still talk about the freedom they felt and how much they loved it. I think it works.
Dont be shy, show us the dawgs cody
9:53 I about lost my shit when the smoke alarm went off. It never fails
If anybody’s wondering, the video of the child wanting to knock the school down is actually a grown man making a voice and pranking people over the phone, still funny tho
My little brother once threw a whole brand new legoset out the window
Kelsey is so effortlessly pretty I'm so jealous of Cody
Kelsey looks like she was a preschool teacher  Edit: CODY AND KELSEY NAMED THEIR BABY OTIS??!! THATS SO CUTE!!
As a former preschool teacher... 100% agree. Some kids, there's evil there for sure. Others are just honest and have no filter. But others are monsters.
This was Kelsey-baiting. Very unethical.
That hoodie is fire. Anybody know the brand?
If your kid makes a mess, teach the kid to clean up with you. Not as a punishment!
"Why do you still watch Cody Ko?" 10:55 ✓ 😂❤
I have been a teacher for almost 10 years and I've taught all the way from high school down to elementary school. Had a kid who was obsessed with scissors and constantly tried to stab his classmates and teachers. He eventually got expelled after stabbing a younger student in the neck. When asked why he did it, he said he just wanted to feel what it's like feeling someone's bl**d trickle over his hand. That's some truly evil stuff right there
Kelsey: We should go get him. Cody: Yah go get him. Typical Dad response 😂❤
Please stop doing the Irish accent, it’s awful
I really think yall are the cutest fam on the internet for sure
10:55  EVERYTHING about this starting from the child like sounds running down the steps straight into the check back to see if his moms watching, RIGHT into “fkn 🐕” and the “oh you know” downplaying into something casual and the quickness of “okay bye” soo ready to get out of there😂
Uncle Noel is definitely gonna teach Otis all the grown-up words.
9:32 ILL BE HAVING THAT
dude the ending memes the editor has been making are fire🔥
Cody in strawberry is crazy
kelsey on the video = hit like
when my older brothers were probably 4 they took my grandmas vacuum after she had just finished cleaning the house and vacuumed out all the water in the toilet with shit eating grins saying “we were just helping”
cody you still made me laugh a lot even after kelsey left
We needed Kelsey for the toddler throwing a bottle at a completely knocked out infant. I’m sorry, but that one was evil & we glossed over it, lol
I also threw my croc out the window when I was a kid and I remember it
Laugh report of the day!!!!! Laugh count: 7
black kids when they find out being white gives you privilege: 14:48
My toddler says fuck a lot 😅
I'm a kindergarten teacher and the kids were guessing the Age of all my colleagues and me. They got my older colleague pretty close another they guessed spot on. Then it got to me, they guessed 45.  Dear reader, im 23 years old.  I've never looked in the mirror the same.
For those wondering the video ends at 6:25
One time my daughter at 2 throw her favorite stuffed animal piggy out the window of the car on the highway I forgot to lock the window and she opened it some how. She screamed and cried. I had to turn around and get out the car to get it off the highway. Thankfully piggy was fine with a little rip. I had to do surgery on Mr piggy. Got a couple stitches. But he is fine😂😂
i was queen of taking my shoes off and throwing them at any given time. first time, my mom went around the whole block and found my other shoe. second time she said fuck the damn shoe
Haven’t seen a Cody video in awhile and now he’s a dad. Wow
cody your eyes are beautifu today nohomo
There's no family therapy choice?
Wait…hamburger help her????????
philly mentioned ??!!!!
The red hoodie is nice 👍
Story time! I have T1Diabetes and worked as a preschool teachers assistant for a while. I wear a CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor: reads my blood sugar constantly) and during nap time one day, I was attempting to rock a 5-year old boy (who was extremely problematic every day… ex: he would kick kids heads while they napped) to sleep. He was giggling and fighting/kicking going to sleep and when that wasn’t working on me like he wanted, knowing I had this monitor inside of me, he grabbed ahold of my CGM (had just put it in a day ago so medical adhesive was FRESH) and quite literally tore it out of me. Which was painful, requires a lot of force to actually do, and costed $75 to replace. I yelped out in pain, somehow managed not to swear, and immediately began to tear up despite trying so hard not to. I couldn’t stop my tears for 10 min afterwards. The kid “apologized” (laughing hysterically) after my coworkers talked to him but then  he proceeded to do what he does to the other kids at nap time and got another talking to from my coworkers. Parents never acknowledged it or me, never apologize, and also never offered to pay for my replacement. The job was $14/hr so that wasted CGM left a sizable dent in my wallet. Insurance wouldn’t cover the cost of one so soon either. I was too afraid of losing my job to do anything else about it unfortunately… kid genuinely didn’t see anything wrong in what he did and would find everything hysterical til we’d mention talking to his parents. But right after sending his parents a message is when he’d realize he’s already in too deep and might as well continue the chaos
Ruby Frankie would love this title
not the Kelsey bait (jk love y’all)
Love the memes at the end😂
I babysat this kid and his toddler brother and my first impression was that he was really sweet because he kind of helped me calm his brother down when he was screaming because he wanted his mom. An hour later while his brother was taking a nap, he walked up to me and started cussing at me incoherently and incessantly with like a random string of words that he knew were bad because he had this devious glare in his eyes and kept saying them under his breath as if he would get in trouble if his parents heard him. Then he started punching me in the leg.
I used to work at an afterschool program in high school and a girl told me I looked pregnant while I was in the middle of recovering from an eating disorder askfjkwk ngl it hurt at the time but I can laugh about it now
did u really just kelsey bait us ???? wtf
WHERE IS HIS JACKET FROM OMG 😭
DJ Cody it’s time to mix the peanut butter baby “ah”’into one of your sets 😂
Kelsey looks so beautiful 😻
when kelsey left, i really felt betrayed
I will never get tired of watching Cody act like a goblin 😂
10/10 video
my mom was an actual evil kid. her neighbors chickens would come into their yard and cause chaos so at a certain age she got tired of it and would turn on the stove and grab them one by one and burn their beaks whenever they got in their yard😶
Apparently when I was like 4 I told my stepmom’s mom that she was fat and that was her last straw and got liposuction
By besties daughter told her the other day “I love your neck it looks like a blown up puffer fish it’s so big”
Kelsey was the click bait everyone wanted
Yes.
i’m still dying after the snore silencer 😂😂❤
*Well the first 6.5 minutes were nice at least*
One time my Cousin asked me why my butt was so big. I replied “Oh I’ve never pooped before”
we have to find Cody he has been replaced with a strawberry
the kid calling about the school is giving AI
The girl with the piñata for SURE has a brother!! 😂😂
4:37 i used to do it to wasps
word of the day: TINGE
If I am not mistaken I heard that irish call on limewire 20 years ago. Might be an oldie, but a goodie.
When you get left with the spare parent
Teach your kids body neutrality. Please. For THEM too. These kids being worried about being fat while being practically BABIES breaks my heart. Any ED survivors just get unnecessarily emotional over those clips?? So sad. Your body is just a vessel for life, teach your kids to practice healthy habits without making it a direct correlation to their appearance (because guess what, it's way less in your control than you even realize). Bodies are bodies, we don't have to teach them those stigmas at age 3. Spare them the pain of developing EDs, practice body neutrality. This came across so crybaby but I meant it seriously, my b
Wow, Cody really baited with the piss drawer huh. I really wanted to see a kids piss drawer.  Never watching this guy again.
Make shirt “dogs are out and breathing”
If we are judging by what we did in our childhood, I'm worse than Stalin.
"Are's is not evil."  🤦‍♂
i literally love kelsey so much. ur so lucky to live w her
9:09 Damn, I listened to this recording of a phone prank when I was 11 or so years old 😅 I’m 26 now.
i want kelsey
❤I'm cool too right? ❤ I feel ya. If I want everyone to RSVP yes I say the Mrs will be there too 😂
im a helper in sunday school at my church and last week we were teaching them a Psalm about how God created the sun and the moon and humans and the teacher asked “okay kids, what did God create” and a kid w/o stutter said “France!! he created France!” HSJS
Kelsey is my favorite who is this dude she let into her video
tinder nightmares next part whennn
Am I stupid, i didnt see a piss drawer story like in the thumbnail, where is it?
Kids > 😂❤
A kid called me “Coach Ugly” for the entirety of the summer camp I worked at. One day he screamed it as he ran past me, tripped, and fell flat on his face. Karma exists for the evil kids too:))))
If a kid starts hurting animals, even flies, keep an eye on them.
These are funny as fuck 🤣🤣
First Kelsey leaves and then Cody fucking teases us with the dogs. Could this day get any worse 😔
I just want to know the retention drop off when kelsey leaves
First time in the corner I thought you weren’t allowed to leave, so I just pissed in the trash can next to me💯
Cody you need to react to the series worlds strictest parents 😭
Literally every person in this video shouldn't have been allowed to have kids.
The Irish one is a joke, it’s one of them voice changer things. It’s an oldie
i just got a flash to 13 years from now and ur son is the age i was when i started followin u
EEEHDJJFHFHF AWEEEE sorry i still fan girl over them being married and having a literal fuckinh child together like EHDJFJF AWEEE GUYSSS
YAYYY KELSEYY
12:56 watch at 0.25x speed
I had a Terry situation when my family went to the beach. My nephew ripped the legs off a hermit crab so it "wouldn't leave" o.o
the irish kid phone call is a prank radio show (look up little becky) btw, i don't understand how anybody would think for a minute that it's real
One time a kid who was like 6 told me I should be naked because I’m a pig 😁
When my brother was 3 he pulled the wings off a fly and said, “Look, it’s a Walk!”
I was nervous that Cody didn’t know peanut butter baby and he would have gotten roasted, another put in a reverse Terry
you can’t click bait us with kelsey’s face that’s just rude #unsubscribe
Theres an easy fix to stop children from calling you fat or pregnant when they see your pouch, a lot of women are self concious so they dont think about this trick : Explain to he child that AFAB people have an additional organ which makes the belly pop up That's just it and thats a fact Uterus is not only always moving (hence why your belly is sometimes flat and sometimes swollen like a balloon) its also an organ that has to be protected from the outside, so that's where the fat tissue will focus on, hugging your belly like a cushion Just explain that to the child, and the child wont call you pregnant again because they will know the difference, no need to have a worse self esteem about it, the children dont know, explain it to them
That girl with the piñata reminds me of my childhood best friend who I told to “tug the door cos it gets stuck” and she ripped it so hard the window flew out and shattered into a million pieces on my grandmas driveway
You need to watch solomon en de sudocreme
Bro 😂🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😅😂
Classic Cody falling for the voice changer Irish clip.
Literally wanna cry happy tears when Cody says how great of a mother Kelsey is.
The kid asking to have her school blown up was fake. It was like a radio show or something and the hosts used a voice changer to prank the demolition company
youre the only one who was able to make me laugh today, thank you cody
13:54 did i just have a stroke
I love your vids!!!!
let kelsey take over the video next time x
at this point, you're ragebaiting with this stupid sponsor, while likely deleting comments about it. what a greedy duo
you should make a song sampling "ah"-baby
please. PLEASE never do an irish accent ever again please. thank you  -a non leprechaun irish person
The blow up school one is a radio station playing a prank… she’s an adult woman putting on a voice
Only in America is it cute to watch a child swear 😮 seriously I love your videos but … I can’t
Holy shit not the little princess going fULL NEEGAN ON THE PINATA (i can't do the squiggly)
why are the clips with caption at the end the funniest thing of every video
Less gf please <3. Just my opinion. You make me laugh n have a good time.
SO CLOSE SO CLOSE, Just say it man ILL BE HAVING THAT  lunch 50% ruined this time
Only a 6 minute long vid!
"Kids are not evil they're honest" This is so true and they're honest until they're told they aren't allowed to say offensive things, then they become like the rest of us, liars.
can we switch up the hat now cody?
I asked my 7 year old cousin to tell me the worst words his dad has said and he said "the f word" and "the s word" and I said "no you need to tell me the words so I know what you mean" and he did the same thing this girl did, he said them so quietly lol
Give Kelsey channel
“Give me a ball part finger”.  Did that only last night.
2:42 one time i was watching a tiktok speed dating live and some lady comes on, out of nowhere her kid enters the room and starts absolutely blasting her saying "NO YOU DIDN'T" "THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN" "MUMMY WHY ARE YOU LYING" when she was trying to flirt with & get to know the person.... the kid was way too young to have been just trying to embarrass his mum, my favourite was "NO YOU WENT TO JAIL" 😭😭😭😭
yeah, kids aren't the evil ones, the parents who instill bad things into their kids are the problem but also YAAAAAAAAY KELSEYYYYY
Dude your editor never misses 😭 the editing always makes things x10 funnier
I love how you can tell they just made love before filming this video. We're eating lunch and I bet Cody was also eating good.
somebody PLEASE tell me where cody got his jacket from, that shit is so fire, i would pay so much money to have one similar
turned it off when the girl left  🙏🏻🙏🏻
The "kid" from Dublin is obviously fake
My mum works at a preschool and a kid said to her "if you were a photo I'd delete you"...
When Kelsey left I stopped watching
Somebody please tell me I’m not the only person who died when they heard the smoke alarm beep at 9:54
You might experience a plastic bottle hitting you in the face now that you’re a parent 😂 toddlers are ruthless
The channel named Kazıklı Maria was constantly talking about this channel.And finally I decided to watch a video of it.Since my English is not very good, I understood seventy percent of the video, but it's okay.
2:23 kid is learning to fight the system young good for him
You listened! My gf is so happy thank you!
ah yes. one time i asked my little cousin to place my tattoo stencil in the middle of my back so i could see if i like it there and she said "i don't think it'll be good there bc ur fat rolls will crease it up"
That little boy at the birthday makes me realize im not ready for kids yet cause i feel no humor about that. Just mad .
I saw Kelsey and clicked immediately
I’m a 20yo nanny and the kids asked me if I had a baby in my belly, I was just wearing a flowy jumpsuit.
THIS is a try not to laugh. The cringe videos are not as funny imo
Cody after Kelsey left is giving "you love dad too, right?"
Total click bait putting Kelsey in the thumbnail
If I was the parent of the kid who took off all the can labels, I'd be like: "Okay then. I'm picking one random can a night and whatever it is, that's what you'll be eating for dinner that night. Enjoy."
"Today we are HIGH BY THE WAY!"
Most of these videos are pretty old but they’re absolute classics idk how Cody hasn’t watched them on the channel before
Why aren't you censoring those children? They can't consent to be on the internet. You have a huge platform, it's very irresponsible to not censor them...
i’m putting on did pjs
So sweet
We've had cody-only videos turn into Kelsey collabs, but we've never had Kelsey collabs turn into cody-only videos. This feels bad, respectfully.
My grandma used to use a walker to get around. Apparently as a toddler I would copy the walk she walked when she was around and hobbled around the house
Isn't that Tiny Tim at 7:10 ?
Dude I fucking love you guys
you look a little bit like harry styles in this, if I squint :)
went downhill when Kelsey left
KELSEY WAS A PRESCHOOL TEACHER??? that makes so much sense
"Well your dad's dead" 😭😭 EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
kelsey is gorgeous 😭
i work in after school care and i can say i’ve been spit on, hit, kicked, ect. i try to never hold a grudge on a child even if they don’t like me, they can be shits sometimes. but they all have their good moments and overall are good kids
1:33 Cody moving the eyelash out of Kelsey’s eye is about the cutest thing I’ve seen in a YouTube video. Such a beautiful couple and now a beautiful little family!
one of the last ones you said was evil has a mom who prioritizes making content/taking pictures and videos over her kid like even as her kid is breaking down and she should be disciplining (if it’s real ) she taking a video like what???
I love Cody’s strawberry sweater, where’s it from also I love Kelsey 🩷🩷 she’s such an amazing mother 🎀 love my parents
Yes. ❤
It’s funny, I think I remember one where they did the say any bad word you want and the kid is just like “GUTS! gutsgutsGUTS!”
evil children are either made by evil parents or parents that spoil their kids 😭
Having to share our YouTube parents with an actual human makes me feel more like the older sibling that now has to learn to share when one parent goes off to take care of the new baby. 😢
As a former teacher, I think people forget that kids have not learned emotional maturity. Especially around death. They have no idea what it is so they think its hilarious. New teachers always make the mistake of telling young students of a personal death and then are shook when they become “that teacher with the dead dad”
Cody is a different animal when Kelsey's not around lol
yinz is pittsburgh but close enough ☝🏻
I feel like we all knew at least 1 kid who ripped wings off of flies.
Cody SAYS these kids aren't evil...but wait until Cody Jr. Pulls some toddler ish
Today we’re.. high by the way💀
cody the hat please where
am i the only one that didn’t know his name is OTIS 🥹🥹🥹🥹
If your hat was red, you’d be the “How do you do, fellow kids” meme no doubt.
What’s the song at the end ?
I’m always here for you Cody
This knocking the school down one is soirse Ronan it was a joke for a radio show
I hope Otis says fuck
9:25 "ILL BE HAVING THAT HEHEH" 👹👹
Ugh. You guys need to post together more. Kelsey is like
Kelsey  come back
As the child of a daycare provider, can confirm 1/30 has evil potential
I liked the phone goblin bit
People are evil, kids are just real
When my friend's kid was about 4yrs old, he knew he wasn't allowed to say the 'F word' (his mum would use it a lot while driving). He worked out the bad word he wasn't allowed to say, and would instead just mutter 'Oh, for SAKES!' when he was annoyed. It's the funniest thing I've ever heard.
the mom who reached out towards the girls ice cream did another vid where all she changed was the reaching for the food, and the baby was polite and respectful with her response. Little girl just didn't want her space invaded while eating, which is very reasonable
They literally do not understand a thing lol children are essentially feral humans
Kody, since Kelsey went to take care of Otis, we all expect you to leave in the next video to take care of Otis and Kelsey gets to entertain. It's only fair.
cody try not to make a goblin joke challenge (impossible)
KELSEY!!!!!
Otis huh
More of these pls 😂
I feel bad for clicking when it had 420k views
granny caught a stray 😂😂😂
As a first grade teacher, I can confirm kids do shit for no other reason than to be evil
Its me or the girl with the Pinata looks like a little version of Lucy from Fallout ?
Milf manor 2 just came out fyi
One of them wasn’t a kid. It was a dude that would do kids voices for pranks
9:55 smoke alarm…. Classic!
this one was hilarious ❤😂😂
I want to know where Cody’s sweatshirt is from! I love it
I miss Kelsey 😔
That is the most disgusting "Hamburger helper" that I have ever seen lmao it looks so watery and disgusting 😂  Also idk but if my kid was ripping the wings or appendages off of any creature even a bug I would be so worried that they are a serial killer and I need to have them tested lmao  Edit: That would be so mean if everyone just left comments after Kelsey leaves that they are turning off the video 😭 lol But honestly fk Cody 😂I'm kidding I am going to turn the video back on 👀 or am I
most of these kids need therapy
booo kelsey’s gone i’m leaving
the moment kelsey left the only thing i could think about after every clip is what would be her commentary be😢😢😢
the dublin one was fake
Yo. How'djyou pick ouwt the philly accent?? Well done.
I think Kelsey needs to do a 20 minute solo video to make up for the clickbait 🙏🏻🙏🏻
3:33
My cousin got so frustrated as a toddler that she said, the worst thing in her vocabulary possible. The horrible word was “luggage” the only way they know these words is if they have heard them and they immediately put into context the circumstances under which these words have been spoken. It’s disgusting. nothing cute about that in my opinion, but that’s just my opinion.
Not the same when it's only Kelsey's husband, but still cool
If my kid took the lables off cans like that, he would be getting canned mysteries for dinner until I got through all of them. 😈
Thank you Cody and Kelsey for joining us this evening
Why is this dude on Kelsey's channel?
Ngl, Otis taking Kelsey from the video early was kinda evil
yes kids are evil lol😂and this is one of the reasons why im never having kids when i get older
cody pls research ur sponsors
Honestly sad for even the first kid. I TRY not to swear around my kids because I feel like it hinders them from functioning in polite or professional settings. I also just think putting your kids onto the internet is generally gross. Idk. Call me judgy idc
That mom and dad moment when y’all disagreed @ 0:57 was so real😂😭
I’m a swim teacher, and I’m afab so I present very feminine(I have boobs and a very feminine voice) but I have a shaved head and don’t shave my armpits, so sometimes I deeply confuse the children I teach. One day I think I had said I wasn’t very good at something and one of my children said “It’s ok cause you’re beautiful on the inside” and I said thank you, and she immediately said “Even though you’re not beautiful on the outside.” all while smiling like she’d said the kindest thing, she genuinely believed she was complimenting me. To this day that is the most brutal and hilarious thing a child(or anyone honestly) has ever said to me.
you always be making me laugh cody, and i gotta say, i love it, thanks for making these videos
Thank you Kelsey’s husband for continuing to cover for her as she tries to find a good home/work life balance ❤
Maybe it’s just my childhood trauma but I don’t think the little girl with the ice cream cone was wrong. She has the right to say no. I grew up in a household being made to think that if someone asks for something or asks you to do something you should do so. Often times I would and still do get guilt trips if I say no. If you’re asking me a question I have the right to answer it in any way I want to
Cody imitating the laughing child was funny asf 😭😭
The way you guys look at each other is fucking beautiful… makes me realize how miserably single I am.
please dont post your kid online, oh my
Thumbnail almost made me vomit thank you so much
this was a great vid lol
we love you Kelsey. Oh yeah, and Cody.
I swear every kid loves reminding us that our dads are dead 😂😭
Wifey is real af for going on cam in relaxed mom mode. I’m a fan
Am I blind or does it look like this videos on greenscreen?
what is a fly without wings? cant stop thinking about it.
A little girl would always ask if I was pregnant when I was teaching too 😭 well sorry I drink bubble tea on my lunch breaks to get me through the day
thank you for that last edit, for all us babies and toddlers
I love you where you going sounds like me when I threw knives at my husband ten minutes ago
"You wanna hug him? And kiss him? Cuz you love him? Well your Dad's dead..." made me laugh for a solid minute.
I work at an elementary school and one of my kids came up to me and told me I looked sick... I'm not sick.
Terry is a woman on meth around me yelling about the cheating homos at the center. I'm crying
i made it to 6:25
i didn't need to be convinced to not have kids but this definitely further cemented that
kelsey is glowing from motherhood <3
Why would you name your child this. Do you not like me
We don't care about you butt stuff spawn. I'm here for the wife
Video ends at 6:30
Click bait asf
"I don't like chicken drumsticks. They're gross." I said (6 years old) as my dad was preparing the chicken drumsticks. He said, "What did you say?" AND I REPEATED IT, because I'm not a liar. I got a hair-pull and a "Don't say that." Never was rude to him about food again. To mom on the other hand..... "Why do you always make zucchini? It makes me gag." Horrible child :))
Once found a shoebox of like five flies without wings in my little sister's room. After some light interrogation I found out the weird little neighbor girl told her flies would be her friends forever if she tore their wings off...
Free Palestine! Children are dying every day there. In the Congo, children are used as slave labor. Children aren’t evil, the adults around them are. I know Cody and Kelsey dont think kids are evil, but i feel this needs to be said
Hey mommmmmm. Love when you’re in videos 🫶🏻💞💞
damn i was hoping kelsey would come back
kelseyyyyyyy!!!! 😄😄
Cody, I can't wait to watch you be the best parent(s) ever!!
I did the fly thing all the time from like age 6 lol. I used to put them into a littlest pet shop treasure chest after I removed the wings (:
I teach kindergarten and have a little belly pooch and I get asked DAILY if I'm pregnant. it doesn't bother me anymore. Kids are just curious. Everything is new to them, so they have a lot of questions and don't have any reason to know social rules.
The kid cursing was probably the purest thing 😂
OUR PARENTS ARE HEREEE 🧎🏻‍♀️
more mrs.ko
do the next episode my MBFOF!!!
not gonna lie... i was genuinely tempted to leave after Kelsey left... but just bc you said it
I work with kids and some of the things that come out of their mouths is insane!! Kids are so funny without even trying!! A kid recently asked me who my parents were when I was a kid (as if you don’t have parents anymore as an adult lol) and then said “are they dead now?” I’m literally in my early twenties!! Like this 5 year old thought I was so old that my parents were DEAD!
Well the first 6 minutes were good lmao
Remember that one time Cody did the chillest video ever, reacting to lo-fi music chat? It was pretty cool🤙
6:23 “We should go get him.” “Okay. Go grab him.” ?? recording was that serious?
Kelsey really said “we should go get him” and Cody said “go get him”
Just after leaving my paternal grandma's burial, I asked my dad how long it will take her to turn into bones
Serial killer kid with the fly
First 6 minutes were great
We want Kelsey
i love the name Otis sm 🥹🥹
that guy on the phone isn't a kid, he does prank calls and man im sick of that voice xD
Thanks for proving me with many laughs especially while working out shit hard but we getting there and on our way ❤
All I can look at it how bomb Kelsey is and her eyebrow shape, incredible. If only she wore more dresses
Okay, this made me laugh so much😂
im an after school teacher, i love my job, here are some great ones "Mr. __ are you ok?" "Yes im good, why?" "you have a lot of dots on your face" *with genuine concern over acne i didnt have earlier in the year*. ive also heard one of my students say to a coworker "you look like you should already be a mom..." also, the vibe i get from the girl asking her mom if shes getting pregnant is that she has some level of genuine excitement she could get a sibling. she doesnt have a connection in her head that that question can be socially construed as a negative tie to being fat
kelsey leaving ruined the video thanks otis
7:20 is so obviously a voice changer lmao
The blow up my school one isn't actually a kid, it's a grown up (a comedian I think) doing a kid voice. Seen this video before.
So nice for Kelsey to let her husband finish the video out
You catfished us with Kelsey
“well ur dad’s dead” top tier evil 🤣😭
18:36 I'm dead, bro
Saying a woman should wear dresses more or smile more isnt chauvinist at all. Its being nice and saying you should express your good qualities. But weak men like cody have been neutered into being absolutely afraid of saying truth and complete woke sheep.
adults try not to blame literal children for what happened to them challenge !!!
ah yes, societies problem of treating children like they’re adults, mature, and should know better. when they’re toddler to teen age. literally first time living. adults saying we should know better is kind of why the same adults don’t care when a child gets sexually assaulted. they’ll blame you. always
Cody letting them dawgs breathe
I came here for Kelsey 😍🥰😊☺️🙂😕🙁☹️ I’m leaving
Is that Taco Tuesday girl?
hey cody can you sample the peanut butter baby in your next track pls and ty
O dis doggy door?
I didn’t even notice the lady’s stomach in the black dress one. I thought she looked so good! Then the little girl pointed out her little pouch. She still looks really good. Don’t matter.
That was not a Philly accent wtf
My boyfriend and I LOVE any content w kelsey in it 😩. You guys are SO funny together.
bro said philly, you have never been to philly if that is what you think we sound like. she sound like a wisconsin typa individual.
The toddler throwing the bottle at the baby is literally the plot of the original DBZ Broly movie lol
YAYYY more kelsey
One of my youngest brothers first words was "fuck" and he would use it when he was mad cause he knew we didn't want him to
Did anyone watch the remaining 13 minutes?
Bettergelp is in controversy rn
@13:54 Cody shows off amazing ventriloquism
18:33 had me laughing on the ground holy shit
I am just loving this cody dad era
You saying ‘take a child and throw it at the screen, and make sure it hits the like button’  reminded me of something Mr Ballen would say
10:23 reminds me of the time i was driving down the interstate and the minivan 2 cars in front of me had just an inflatable ball fly out the window and bounce around for a bit and i thought "if you dont fuck around you never find out"
Glad I stopped going on TT. Wtf kinda trend is that, having your kid swear?
the fly bit was too good otis had to let yall know he wasnt sleeping on you
Great video! Sucks that it was only 6 minutes and 25 seconds long
I work with Elementary aged kids and last year I caught two kids putting tuberculocide in my boss's coffee as a prank.
cody 🫱🏼‍🫲🏽 use of the word tinge in this video
my favorite thing my 2 1/2 year old nephew has started saying completely out of nowhere bc he heard his dad say it one time is "ow my NUTS!"🤣🤣
zade's memes at the very end of the vids get me every time 😭
So no weed memes at the end of the last video but we got Dora the Explorer memes at the end of this video very interesting
Naming a child Otis is evil.
Kelseeyyyy we miss youuuu 🥹
who found delilah’s pee drawer😰
‘Today we are high by the way’
Baited on the demo video
glad kelsey's back, happy for the fam!!!
Cody just want to say I’m a big fan but I can’t get behind you naming your son Otis
Cody just so you know she was probably taught how to swing a bat by her dad which youll have to start doing with your kid soon
I don't do kids HOWEVER that lil girl smiling at the camera saying b¡tch is the cutest kid I've ever seen in my entire life! Omg 😊😊❤❤ love her ❤❤
Show us the stats of the viewership numbers dropping off immediately when Kelsey leaves the video, Cody.
12:15 lool when my sister threw a 2L water bottle, almost empty or fully empty i don't remember to my face when i just dozed off watching ppomoasmr on my while laptop on my chest
I love you Cody but....I want more of Kelsey 😭 she literally makes my day better by simply being on the video. Again love you both but her lil more
Well if you're Christian the bible says we are born of sin And children of wrath so I guess the answer is yes.
Can someone tell me what happens after Kelsey left?
Why does one look like she smells like soap and the other look like he smells like toast? 0:33
Clicked for kelsey, left for kelsey
Hmm, weird glitch in this video.... anybody else unable to see the top of Cody's head?
More of these dude, very good very very good
im a preschool teacher and i had a kid tell me he was gonna bring his dads shotgun to school and kill me, then made shooting sounds and a finger gun. i told his mom and she laughed
UGH YES I LOVE KELSEY AND HER HUSBAND
first video is one of my all time favs
when i was like 2 or 3 my dad ran into the attorney general of my state in the grocery store and had polite conversation with her and i interrupted them to say “where the fuck is my fucking dolly”
got an ad halfway through this video of two parents crying their baby died sooo fucked up😭
I’m eating dinner right now not lunch what the hell is going on
Missed "I'll be having that" phone goblin moment :(
tearing a fly's wings off and _naming it terry_ is truly a power move
Love the KelseyKe channel, her bf is alright too
no offence but ill stop the video now that Kelsey is gone lmak
the dublin kid is so scripted and lame tho, like they obviously had her say words she doesnt even know, much less how to pronounce
A little girl (3/4) once told me I was pretty and my ego went through the roof that day
I’m a teacher (and the daughter of retired teachers) and things always make so much more sense upon meeting the parents. If I had a dollar for every time I’ve heard “Wait until you meet their parent” from a previous teacher, my student loans would be paid off.
You know Kelsey is simultaneously the hardest person and the kindest person ever. It takes a special kind of person to be a preschool teacher.
ALSO WHY DOES YOUR BABY MONITO PLAY THE TESLA MELTDOWN ALARM BAHAHAHA
I have to stop cursing because my niece is just a repeating machine at this point but is so hard hahaha Also the first videos the brazilian kids go WILD
The way that girl's face starts twitching when the toddler says she looks pregnant 😭 I feel her. My mom said that to me a while back and I've stopped wearing dresses ever since.
I know there’s no way that kid in the second to last video understands the concept of death, he’s way too young, but damn idk if I’d ever recover from hearing “well you can’t because your dad’s dead.”
The know-it-all energy is skyrocketing after that first video
Kelsey is back, I have missed you two together videos, I love both of you guys each, but together can't be beat! Love the vids, and I hope both of you and the kiddo are doing well!
Perfect timing for me to eat my burrito from the taco truck
okay but reg cody vid when?
im a summer camp counselor and one time i had a camper tell me “i think love you more than my mom because you’re the 2nd prettiest person i talk to” 🥹
"Today, we are..."  "High, by the way im back"
“They’re not trying to watch the world burn, they’re trying to watch a Croc fly in the wind.” -Cody Ko, 2024
Thought i'd make out of this unscathed, and in the last minute hit with the dead dad jump scare.
The editing at 13:53 😅
I miss Kelsey.
" WE should go get him" "OK go get him" Lol ok
KELSEY IS SO BEAUTIFUL ALWAYS
The Irish kid saying “give me a ballpark figure” is one of the funniest things I’ve ever heard
we missed u mami y papi
great video kelseys husband
Lol. This current thumbnail though
Day 0 of Cody not mentioning goblins
It all circles back to goblin mode
the memes at the end have me cryinggggg
can u pls react to the chinese kindergarten basketball show competition
WE WANT KELSEEYYYYY
Kelsey’s husband and Otis’ dad coming in clutch with the lunch time video again!! Respect ✊
16:50 red40 at its finest probably
WHERE WAS THE PISS DRAWER PROMISED IN THE THUMBNAIL CODY???
It would be so funny if Cody show the analytics chart and there was a drop off in viewing time after Kelsey left
CLICKBAIT SHE LEFt AFTER 5 Minutes!!!
16:51 Cody just ignoring the « right answer wrong tone »
Kelsey not knowing a kid that young knows EXACTLY how to use the word bitch is so precious. New parents are adorable man
Took me a fee minutes to recover from that Kelsey tease
Middle school teacher here, they are
Watched this holding my 6 week old, now he's looking at me with ideas
20:05 I was thinking it's like a real life Blue's Clues
Cody is smart but sometimes he acts like Luke from modern family and then I’m confused but he’s built an app 🥰
Next time can you go and Kelsey stays?
We love u guys so much aw my headt
Ugh why does the baby get all the attention, what about us!?
… I would take the fly wings off when I was little IDK WHY 😭
Cody and Kelsey are like not real, or this is just what being raised in a 2 parent loving household creates. How are they so radiant and happy with a newborn baby? I get it babies are amazing, I’m a nanny, so I also know that it’s fucking hell having a newborn baby.
I love your channel, but can you stop bringing the guest on? I don't like him
The memes Zade makes at the end with Cody’s sayings are so funny😂
“Today we are.. high 😀”
I’m gonna be honest I think Kelsey’s husband is in too many of these videos… 😅
Am I trippin or do they keep the editing more respectful when Kelsey is in the video lmaoo it’s cute
Bring back kelsey!
kelsey we love you keep being in cody's videos plssss
irish kids are just born as mini adults
Sorry to be this way but I liked the video immediately when Cody got the eyelash for Kelsey and made her make a wish 🥹✨
Do you even enjoy making these?
what the hell? a whole entire lunch just appeared in front of me
14:28 She doesn't even look big or pregnant 😭
I know this is a very American perspective, but kids with distinct regional accents will never not be funny to me!
Imagine, getting into your car while in the desert. Wife and kid in the car. Driving to get dinner with your extended family and then running out of gas.
thumbnail is fucked up. Been a long time fan but i have a severe case of ocd no one needs to see that.
is that kid on Dublin for real? idk , it gives the vibes onf an adult with a voice modifier XD although I've met pretty eloquent kids so maybe it's real
The thumbnail (piss drawer) is nasty and … tbh I hate it. The video is good and funny tho. There’s no piss drawer in the video, which I appreciate 👍
One time as a kid I said at the dinner table, “if a fat person lost a bunch of weight, wouldn’t they have a bunch of muscle left that was carrying the weight?” And I was saying it to my mom who was fat. It was my way of trying to “help.”
Ok, so when I was a kid I had a big interest in insects I kept them in jars by my bed and the really evil part was that  I use to remove the big legs from the grasshoppers and left only the small ones and just watch them walk away, I still feel guilty about it :( Now I'm still interested in insects, I love them and every time I find a random insect I try to save it, I never kill the insects that get inside my house, unless they are cockroaches and mosquitos, and I have like a small phobia from grasshoppers, every time I see one there is always a small thought in my head if this is the one that will avenge his ancestors :D  I somehow can't touch them now and use a jar to capture them and release them outside. So I still atoning for my sins to the grasshoppers but I turn out ok, I don't think I'm evil now so there is a hope for Terry's friend :D
ruby would say so
Today we are -HIGH , im back
I love what Kelsey said about the little girl with the bat. It reminds me of when I was a kid playing soccer, and my dad told me I needed to keep the ball away from the other kids. Don’t let anyone else take it, he said. So when another little girl from the other team came to take it, I elbowed her in the gut, she dropped, and I got expelled from the game. Ref was like I’ve never had to use a yellow card let alone a red card on a 8 year old girls’ soccer match until today. 💀
Can you give us the stats on retention once Kelsey leaves? Just curious
people who turned off the video when kelsey left>>    KIDDING
Shoutout to that dora joke at the end, that was gold XD
It’s so nice seeing Kelsey and her husband back to reacting again
The school one is not a kid.
PHILLY MENTIONED 🦅
@Cody Ko the one where the Irish child was calling in to knock down a school. the 'Kid' was actually a radio host using a voice changer and calling a construction company. just so you know. not all Irish children are that evil.....some are though :P
I related to the dead dad clip so hard. My 4yr daughter says stuff like this but with the sweetest tone and then shell wipe my tears when i cry. Last week we were layin in the grass looking at stars and she points out my cat staring off in the street and she says "mom, look at Cleo, I think she wants to go to heaven now!" And im like baby "dont say stuff like that. That means she would have to die to go to heaven." Then she laughs and says "oooh! 😂 mommy is your dad DEAD?!"  Like thanka kid.. i been cryin bout it for 10+years lol
Negan child
My sister when she wants a bite of my food: “did you want to try mine???” 😂😂😂
I disliked because Kelsey left - don't do that - but I'm also subscribed so it balances out
Brit here, what on earth is 'Hamburger helper'??
The fact that Kelsey didn’t flinch shows how healthy and loving their relationship is.
So FYI...ripping wings off a fly is not hard at all if anyone was wondering
i waited so patiently for you to say “i’ll be having that” 😔😔😔
The way her face starts twitching @ 14:14 😳😳 😂😅
Kelsey come back, Cody instantly started having bad takes!
I do love seeing Kelsey in your videos again, I hope to see her more often.
Who... Is Otis? Where's Gunther? Kelsey should've had Gunthy months ago...
on my break rnnnn perfect timing 😍
Dont want to be a prude but when did kids swearing become funny
missed the most perfect ILL BE HAVING THAT👹👹
18:48 who else felt like he was directly talking to you 😎
When her kid said she looked pregnant you could SEE her face twitching so bad
I hate that we got stuck with Kelsey’s husband
I was missing Kelsey the whole video after she left :(
That Philly accent’s craaaaazy
so excited to see kelsey in this one! hope she doesn't have to leave 6:25 into the video.
18:33 🙆‍♀️
otis is definitely a name. that’s for sure! 😅🥹🥹🥹
I've always wondered why there's one shoe in the highway like how does that happen? It all totally makes sense now.
Kids are absolutely the worst lmao
I wish h24’s were street legal 😔  Edit: how the fuck did I get on a Cody Ko video 😭
kelsey leaves i leave
That peanut butter baby is or has grown up to have some kind of weird peanut butter fetish 😂😂😂
15:51 16:01
Cody and Kelsey are preparing for when their child is a little menance 😂
DO A PART TWO (with kelsey please)
Cody " today we are-" "High btw"- kelsey🌬💨  I know that's not what they meant but that's how I heard it lol. 😂
The only Otis I know was the only person in my high school of like 500 total people to get arrested on campus and expelled
i saw a comment response to the unlabeled cans one somewhere that said "i'd have him pick two random cans every day and that's what we eat for dinner that night"
anyone else notice the first sentence?👀
😂😂
Nothing like a couple Ottis makers reacting to some content
Cody getting ready for his Duck Dynasty review episode:) quack quack
Cody.... this is an intervention... we need to have a talk about the hat...
Hey, I'm a wholesome gal. Currently TTC with my husband. I love kids and can't wait to be a momma. Videos like this make me laugh so fucking hard. I laughed from start to finish. Thank you Cody, sick video. I thought this part with you and Kelsey was super hilarious 3:30 lol young chauvinist, you should smile more. 😂😂😂 Ahhh I DON'T KNOW WHAT I TOOK BUT I TOOK TOO MANY ❤
I literally cried watching the baby getting hit with the bottle and crying.. He literally did nothing to deserve that..
as someone who works in education: i see the thumbnail, i like the video. simple as that
PHILLY MENTIONED🔥🔥🔥
im a  toddler and this video is soooo offensive
yoo cody I jusy need to say this cuz its so nice and I appreciate it a lot that you sober and me high spot the same thing in people. Like its so funny cuz when Im sober you are the one who drags my attention to certain behavior in people but when im high we are equal at that aspect. Very funny and nice.
I used to catch flies in my bedroom window and pull their wings off. and then when i got bored i pulled their legs off. kept a little pile of them under my sisters bed.
Video so short, why today we only got a 6 min vid? normaly is 20.
9:26 “I’LL BE HAVING THAT”
ngl if my kid takes all the wrappers off the cans were gonna play a new game called youre having mystery soup for dinner for the next week lmao
8:41 im pretty sure thats Saoirse Ronan in the radio prank, i think I saw her talking about it on a talk show before because she once won a trip to Florida for an impression of the Gingerbread man from Shrek. I think the talk show was Graham Norton,
lets fucking gooo
Ironic that she tells the little girl she's being rude with the way she said no, when the lady was rudely grabbing her food lol. You started the rudeness, lady! Maybe if you had asked nicely she would've answered nicely
cody how are you still taking this unethical sponsorship
my nephew makes the best dead dad jokes to my sister and me. absolutely roasts us. It’s amazing
3:46 nah nah nah this kid isnt evil shes EFFICIENT. every little Mexican kid KNOWS that if you want the candy you have to HIT that piñata with all you've got. Once we got old enough the would also put a blindfold on us, and they would put the piñata rope over a tree and they would hold the rope on the other said and like yank it upwards to trick us. At that point we especially learned that we had to act fast to destroy that thing.
I think the Dublin schoolboy was fake, he sounded like a lady trying to sound like a boy sorta.
Kody!! We need the rest of the “My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiancé Series!!!”
9:51  this is exactly what I said as a kid when I didn’t finish my food and I was a really picky eater so I didn’t say that phrase once but probably more than I could count.
when i was 20 i was300 lbs and a kid asked me if i was pregnant 😂 made me lose weight
new camera???
KELSEYYYY
3:48 An obvious reflection of how many chancletas she received & repressed in her past years.
Not sure what it is but the quality of the video went downhill after 6:25
when i was 7 ish i was in walmart with my mom and we were walking through one of the aisles and there was a pretty big guy standing in the aisle, my mom walked past him but when i tried to walk past he moved a bit so i couldn’t get by  and i shouted “I CANT GO THROUGH THIS GUY’S BELLY IS TOO BIG” my mom was mortified, im mortified every time i imagine myself doing that, kids are brutally honestly. hope that walmart guy is doing well
I’m sorry…. OTIS???
The Irish kid is an adult with a voice mod... we all know that, right?
0o0 two hours ago, yay, I don’t like being caught up, how am I supposed to each lunch T-T
The fact that Cody and Kelsey finfd all of this is cute, and me just happy I got surgery to never have kids. Some of us are just not meant to be parents
I guess that's why they say, kids just be kidding lmao xD  too bad about that guys dad tho... :(
I love this video 🫶
As metallica once said..."Am i evil? I am man."
This was hilarious! So sad Kelsey had to go
not the kelsey clickbait
I believe the Dublin one was a prank by a guy who goes by little Timmy, so you got fooled again Cody 🤷🏻‍♂️
I thought pickle was a bad word when I was little
This was a good one.
As a parent myself, I can tell you that almost all kids do is imitate their parents, but they can still choose to do stupid sh*t. I know in our case, our baby does stupid stuff, but he doesn’t know that it’s wrong until we tell him.
The kid calling for the demolition for the school 😂😂😂😂😂 he sounds so smart like an adult
cringe tiktok
“hi welcome back we ar- high😮‍💨”
Pro tip teach kids how to be good liars and be highly highly manipulative at a young age, theyll grow uo being more creative and probably have a higher IQ
Thanks for this Cody, I needed a good laugh today - got at least 4 or 5 outta this. What is this a fucking joke factory?
Having Cody Ko as your father is one of the coolest things ever
thank you cody
My first cuss word was “fuckitdamn” LMAO all together in one
As kids my sister would smack flys out of the air with a hairbrush and proceeded to take their wings off and put them in little houses as pet “walks”
You gotta make a song about being a dad with Danny 😂
Kelsey left us 😫
I was so happy when I saw Kelsey
We love the posting time eating my eggs and eggos
My mom used to have a rule that my little sisters (4 and 5 at the time) could say any word they wanted on Mississippi Ave and one time we had to spend a prolonged amount of time driving down Mississippi and they got HELLA creative, and the most memorable thing I'd ever heard was "fuck YOUUUUU cookie monster", even though it was one of the more tame things they said. Like wtf did cuddly lovable ol cookie monster do to you, bestie?!
I’m just glad that all the parents in these videos seem to be good sports, a nice change from the usual evil reactions you see 😭
That fake Irish accent you're putting on is a wee bit evil
best thumbnail evar
Dude one time my niece was like “what happened to your mom? Oh yeah she’s dead.” And I was so mad lmao
These things all come from the parents or adults in their lives
9:55 the chirp, every single time.
day 5 of asking for a live set for his biggest fans, Ottawa
otis will be having that
just wanted to let you know that bc of you I ordered that red hoodie you're wearing and it gets in on Monday
We did the bathroom curse word thing with our kid and she just said "Hello......hello bitch. Hello bitch."
Best birthday present I could ask for is Cody posting
One of my neices actually mentioned me and my fat belly in her prayers 😅😢
My parents
i love the otismakers
@13:15 omfg 😂
Even my son comes home from school and tells me how insane some of these gen alpha kids are.
I gained a bit of weight and my nephew keeps asking me if I have a baby in my tummy... and gets sad af when I say no. also suggested I try brushing my teeth 3 times a day lmao
Day 74 of asking Cody to continue yandere simulator
why does cody’s head look huge
I LOVE seeing Kelsey in the thumbnail!
SHOW HAPPY KELSEY IS BAAAACK!!!!!
My brother used to find crane flies in our yard, tear off their wings and legs, and drown them in a frisbee filled with water. 😶
Cody!!!!! You forgot the Goblin line with the 9:20 clip! Ill be having that!
7:24 It sounds like an adult guy with a voice editor
The Irish one is fake but I really wish it wasn’t
Cody should do a song about peanut butter baby using the "aa!" as a sample.
so no one is gonna mention how the thumbnail is clickbait?
Well your dads dead took me so far out
Kelsey said we should go get him & Cody goes “ yea u go get him “ 🥴 next time YOU go sir & leave us Kelsey.
LUNCH TIME
that one from dublin wasn't a kid how did cody not know? What kid knows what a fax is?
10:55 I've never wanted Kelsey's reaction to a clip, more :')
Would love to see the stats on how many viewers clicked out at 6:00. Great video, kids be crazy.
I NEED this zip up
I’m glad you changed the thumbnail to include Chelsea 🤍 I clicked faster.. sorry
bro wtf with that shit. She stays you go next time
Kelsey!!!!!!!!!!!!
hi its me john fallout i need 2000 bottle caps to get into new vegas so i can save the mojave desert
The piss drawer kid literally looks exactly like me as a child. I've shown this photo to multiple friends and family and they're all confused and truly think it was an old photo...
i wish the video was longer 😞 too bad it ended at 6:25
Omfg the fire alarm in the "i dont wanna be a fat grownup" video
That video with the woman in the black dress makes me sad because she’s so gorgeous and the tummy is cute and also there just cause ovaries be behind them.
Watching you become a father in real time is like watching a Pokemon reach its final evolution IRL.
Piñatas are hard for kids to hit open. It takes that one kid to go crazy on it. Also I've had to click off your videos before because of my kids hearing the word fuck so much. But I do love your videos
My little sister one time got in trouble and in retaliation she took out my dads shoelaces out his shoe 😂
Kelsey’s husband posted again!
6:34 man, forget this video!
As a person who also attended a nearly falling down school in Dublin, I cannot blame that child for wanting to knock down their school. Ten years after I graduated my school the kids literally held a protest at the government buildings because the school was a health hazard, I’m not making this up.
The fact that a Canadian clocked a Philly accent in under 2 seconds impresses me.
this video got me good
when i was a child i would make my dad birthday cards and i didnt know hpw to spell dad so i wrote "dead" all over the cards
Having worked with kids in the past this is hilarious. Also I love when Cody hot takes: "we need villains" 😂😂😂
obsessed with the kesley and cody content being back. now its not just cody ko at lunch, its cody and kelsey ko at lunch
My daughter would find bugs/worms whatever to "play with" knowing all the long its going to die which led to her favorite part... the funerals... she had a nack for beautiful eulogies and still wants to be a writer.
Yes, yes they are.
Kelsey is backkk! Might start watching again ;P
I mean the kid talking about blowing up the school was clearly a voice changer
Cody your amazing dude. You time it perfectly every time. Just got my Chick-fil-a and now I have a great video to watch. Again, you’re out here doing Gods work
yay i love both of uuuuu ❤❤
I can't believe we're seeing Peanut Butter Baby in a reaction video in 2024
Most evil thing I did as a kid and I truly do not know what compelled me to say this. I walk up to  my uncle and my aunt who was just his gf at the time. I ask them "Who's older and who's younger?" My aunt said "I'm younger than him" I said "Yay you're going to live longer than him!! I like u better!" I feel absolutely awful about that to this day 😭 my grandma was right there and was NOT happy let's just say that.
There sweet when there cute little balls of dough…  Just wait …  They will break you down… and they do it on purpose. I know it! I swear I’m not crazy!!!
I see you changing the thumbnail Cody 👀
Unc Cody lookin good today
4:39 this reminds me of how my brother used to cut off spider legs as a kid
Didn't have to watch the video to tell u that yes yes they are.
Terry the fly was the first victim of a future killer
Please make this a series, kids are hilarious. Its also so adorable seeing how kelsey and you react because you got a lil one yourself
_wow so that's why there are random kid's shoes on the side of the road_
Kelsey is hot
I love finding out that you’re a fellow school employee!!!
9:25 I rewound to see the dogs and they weren’t even in frame 😔
just in time for my lunch break
"granny caught a straay" 💀💀
Kids are so weird. I remember being 5 and hating my grandmas kisses. In my head I thought I wish she’d die and then months later when she did I thought it was my fault 😂
perfect timing as always
That was definitely not an irish child someone was doing a voice
They can name their 2nd kid cletus
kelsey is looking absolutely BEAUTIFULLL wow even tho i'm sure she's been exhausted lately she is glowing!!! she's all i can focus on thru this video i don't even know who that man is next to her
Rare moment when Kelsey ALSO joins us for lunch
I FUCKING LOVE THIS SERIES
Thanks for timing my lunch perfectly for me, Cody :)
Yes
You named your kid after a cartoon cow. That’s wild
is peanut butter baby evil?
Wish we saw the clip about the boy on Tv little mash up lol
ill be having that
"some kids just wanna see a croc flying in the wind"  :')
Kelsey is so funny I missed her so much
so kind for Kelsey to step away and let her husband get all the exposure in the video!
That makes sense as to why I occasionally see a single baby shoe on the road 💀
‘I have purse’ - Kelsey
second to last clip reminds me of when i was a little kid and i just walked up to my dad and said “you’ll die first.” cause he’s older than my mom. i don’t remember how he reacted to that but if my kid said that to me id be terrified
I cant believe THIS is the video that gives me baby fever
My son just made a sympathy card for his gma bc her mom (his great gma) passed away. It said "don't worry your mom is in heaven...and you'll be there with her soon".  So sweet and hilarious!!
... otis?? The first time I've heard a name!
Good job editor (Gabe?) on that Dora bit at the end.
Here
8.33 a child referencing a fax machine gave it away
HI CODY BRING BACK WHO LET ME HAVE FUN MERCH PLZ DAY 101
from being a summer camp counselor for years. i’ve seen, and heard things 😂😂😂 one time i was about 15 and i was helping at camp. a girl came up to me, and asked me if i was pregnant 😭 granted, her mom at the time was pregnant so maybe that’s why she asked but i was so confused and thinking…do i look pregnant??
Kelsey is such a gem 🥰 when she left the video I instantly stopped watching
We were only here for Kelsey
I clicked off when Kelsey left LMAO
The dublin was fake as hell. Even sounded ai voice or like a prank voice changer. Prob for radio
genuinely so upset that Cody didn't say "i'LL BE HAVING THIS" while talking abt the phone goblin
18:57 am I crazy or is Cody reacting to a different clip????
Very confused bout the response on the gender reveal clip 😂😂😂
Cody she said WE should go get him 😭
The editing is really messed up towards the end lmao. Cody's commentary has nothing to do with the video he watched
I miss Kelsey
HILARIOUS ending as per usual, Zade🎉 We couldn't wait until dinner to watch cuz we saw Kelsey, but this one is now a family FAV, so FUNNY!!!
“I love you where you going? You going home? Okay bye” I love that child I love them
18:55 was that a different reaction than the clip?😅
The way that Cody refers to all kids as boys xD
Cody the opposite of a little girl is a dude???😂😂😂
The clip from 18:45 didn’t match the reaction that follows it
Kelsey looks incredible! She is glowing!
cody you’re using big words again
Noooooo kelsy come back your 75% of why I chose this video
18:54 bro is talking about a completely different clip
Bro, I just got done with work and I’m about to eat. Thank you so much. It’s lunchtime now fellas
At 2:20 i thought he grounded his kid into canned chili like the south park episode
Yes! More couple videos.😂
Kelsey leaves at 6:25, prepare to pack it up and leave prematurely
Dang I haven't LOL'ed this much at a YouTube video in a long time, gotta see more of these in the future 😂
Good luck you twoooo
Imagine how much I like Kelsey that when Cody said "I wouldn't blame you for turning it off rn" I considered that shit 😭
When Kelsey dips, I dip ✌️
18:50 when cody started talking i really thought i was having a stroke
video ends at 6:26 btw
Left over dominos today for lunch , what bout y’all ?
On the eve of my son turning 3 years old, he decided to take it upon himself to get the baby powder and cover every inch of our bedroom with it. He told us "It snowed in your room!" and it sure did.
1:34 awwww😢
the Irish prank call was a voice changer
Hang on where'd Kelsey go from the thumbnail???
when kelsey left i feel like the older sibling who gets jealous when their parents have another kid
THIS IA AK CUTE
HWLPPP HELLOOOOO
can kelsey make a video speaking about how is it like being a preeschool teacher? i didnt know she was
Literally pulled up to Arby's for lunch. Time for some crispy chicken and codyko
No I refuse watch this video without Kelsey
I had to rewatch the balloon video and commentary multiple times to make sure I wasn’t crazy.
GOBLIN MODEEE
honey bunches of otis
Cody we love you BUT PLEASE stop with batter help. Do some research PLEASE.
Is Otis a big blck man or..? 😬
I can already see 3 year old Otis doing the fuck boi laugh bc of Cody doing it ironically so much
the commentary after 18:48 doesnt match the video ?😆
This is funny because they just had one
Kelsey’s husband was a real one for taking over the video!!
Would they call Otis, Oats for short
Am I trippin or is 19 min reaction not correlating to the video lol
Oh how I've missed Kelsey's face on this channel! The Mother is Mothering 🤍
MY PARENTS JUST POSTED
0:00 "Today we are high 🤤🍃🌿"
it's so concerning to me that these 3 and 4 year olds even know words like "bitch" and phrases like "fucking bitch" . I understand parents can't keep it together all the time, but this just feels like they're not even trying
Oh boy, watching this on my lunch break as a preschool teacher is about to hit different 😂
18:54 I don’t think Cody’s commentary matches the clip he just watched.
16:00 i cant believe one of my fave clips online is in here 😭😭 the way the baby slaps tf outta him gets me everytime
Damn I thought that was a Nintendo jacket at first.  That would’ve been 🔥
I just recently quit my job at a daycare. There was a particular child who once said they were going to stab me with a knife and did the stabbing motion he went on to say some more incredibly violent things. The mother of the child was on drugs while pregnant with the child which is what ended up being the child’s largest issue. Children have so many issues these days if you have kids please love and care for them. Don’t worry about the child they’re with good family and is getting the help they need now.
Unfortunate that the school demolition bit was a grown man
No thumbnail? Ballsy.
Universal Healthcare.
18:54 what the hell video is Cody talking about lol, I think they put the wrong clip in
The kid punching the dad in the face while the mom just sits there is hilarious
just in time for lunch
Wow! That one kid dropping the N word, HARD R,  was crazy! 😂
thanks for this 6:28 minute video! loved it
18:54 are we talking about the same clip we just saw Cody 😂 it was a little girl about to pop her future siblings gender reveal balloon 😂😂😂
everyone says they neat lunch while watching these lol its breakfast for me
kelsey being a preschool teacher in the past is so fitting i love it
A new channel video and a new insanely chill podcast, lunch is hitting different today
18:53 I think the clip and the reaction are off 😅
6:47 god dammit why couldn’t Kelsey keep filming and Cody go breastfeed🙄 just ruined my lunch
How’s it going Lunch crew?
Maybe Cody should have gone to Otis and left Kelsey in charge of the channel for a minute...
Pretty sure he edited in the wrong response for the vid at the 18:37 mark.
KELSEEEEEEEEEY YEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Cody uploaded 15 mins ago? WE'LL BE HAVING THAT
Update: that part of the video has since been removed, so don't worry about it.][That one at 18:30 was fucked up to all hell, 20 people all yelling at the little kid to do something, she got overwhelmed and bailed. Her mom turns to her AND YELLS at her about it, the MOM while being unable to control herself let go of the balloon. Pissed me off.
18:53 What is he reacting to i’m so confused 😭
kelsey is legit stunning.
My daughter was 3 when she saw me change my shirt. She saw my belly, pointed at it and said: YOU'RE FAT! yeah I cried myself to sleep for the next week.
What is this strange goblin man doing on Kelsey’s channel
Cody and Kelsey: you can say any bad word or anything you want Otis: what up chodsters! It’s Otis. I’m gonna call you guys my otters. Odors? whatever let’s talk about how I just shit my pants aha ha🤙🏻
15:30 just cried watching this. I’m at work btw
While I love me some Kody solo time, taking away Kelsey from a video is truly evil
I flarbded when I saw you posted and now my couch is a mess but at least I still have my lunch
Love how you were able to pick out that Philly af accent
What in the jump cut just happened… one second I’m looking at an escaped gender reveal balloon and Cody’s reaction is a kid thiefing something…. So confused… now I want to know what happened with the thief
I know a misogynist 5 year old.. we were at the pool and we walked by ladies in bikinis and he said that they need to cover up 😭
nice vid kelsey's husband also congrats on not working anymore very W indeed
9:55 chirp, of course
am I seeing things or does the moms cheek twitch? lol 14:10
18:45 wrong clip reaction??
Now that kid that throws the bottle in the crib…evil…ahole…
"Where are you going? Are you going home?"  "Yeah"  "Ok."  *walks away*
KODy Toadz
crying laughing at this one
Dang, gotta stop watching now that Kelsey is gone✌️
I work with kids and it’s always hilarious when they swear- I have to hold in my laughter. There’s one 6 year old who’s always saying “fucker” and I have to ask him to stop constantly
Kelsey! Why did you leave the tiny goblin in the red jacket unattended?!
It's crazy how becoming a parent immediately makes you dress like parents. Did they buy these clothes or do they just appear automatically when you give birth?
We already know what Otis is gonna say
Ok not to be all serious here but the vid with the two cribs right next to each other is actually really concerning from a negligence POV: a set up like that can cause serious injury to the older child who is mobile and may try to climb out of their crib into the baby’s and get stuck or seriously injured by slipping through the space/ hanging from and being caught in the gap. The cribs should be spaced out at opposite sides of the room at least if they cannot afford to have each child to their own room. SMH. Also, if this incident had occurred between my babies, I would never upload the footage online. Poor baba just laying there defenseless and being hit in the face? So sad/ unfortunate (of course the toddler is not at fault as he is a baby too) my above advice should have been put in place to avoid something like this. Crazy how people will upload anything for 15mins of fame online 🤦‍♀️
He posted right after lunch 💔💔
MORE FRIDGE RATING VIDEOS PLEASEEEE
I don’t have children yet, but I did use what scraps I have left of my inner child and like this video….and now ima go sleep 👍🏻
I need that chaotic evil chart to put these kids on
Nice video Kelsey’s Husband
Before even watching the video: yes
The Otismakers are back at it reviewing other people's end product
12:03 Bro literally woke up and chose violence. 💀
Lunchtime ✨
im goin no where cody i knew yall would be great parents and im supporting that shit go kel go!!!! take care o dat babuh
"a dude or a girl?🤨"
Cody, good sir,  YOU MADE MY 3 YEAR OLD PICK UP HER BABY SISTER IN WHAT I BELIEVE WAS AN ATTEMPT FOLLOW YOUR ORDERS
I feel bad for the kid who was supposed to pop the gender reveal balloon. Everyone was yelling and shouting at them at the start which I think just really overwhelmed her and then when they took away the knife and she screamed I’m not suprised because that’s how her own family acts and she’s literally 6.
I think this is an opportunity to talk about the children of gaz4 who do not get to live their childhood, who get murd3red in their sleep, who have to grow fast to take care of their siblings by themselves, who suffer and d1e from hunger and terror, who have to watch their parents getting R worded and k1lled right in front of them, who watch the kids around the world enjoying their life and celebrating their birthday but who are not able to live to another birthday.
Damn a lot of these are some dated ass videos, lol
Kelsey, who is this little goblin in the red jacket you recorded with?
Ngl did only click bc i love kelsey content but i did stay lmao
was the reaction to the gender reveal the correct one? sounds like he was reacting to a kid brother take something from another
Posted literally as I’m walking into chipotle 💀 completed the meal experience
Kelsey is such a sweetheart for taking time out of her day to make Cody's video fkn slap x10 harder
1:55 “Umm…GUN!” using gun as a bad word was a little too real for a toddler. I guess that’s how it is now
9:54 Not the smoke alarm. 💀
omg love how cody recognized the philadelphia accent right away😭
Omgggggg welcome back Kelsey!!! ❤️❤️ jumped so quick to this video
The kid at the end wasn’t mocking their grandparent, that’s actually a sign of empathy
yay! more of kelsey and not just her husband🥰
The labels off cans was totally me as an evil child 😆
Imagine Otis watching this in 10 years 😂
The no-nonsense, almost adult tone of voice that Irish children have is honestly one of the cutest and funniest things ever
I was not expecting a post on the Main Channel for lunch time but i have been blessed
My favorite parents
The “bratty kid who ruined the gender reveal” was obviously overstimulated and feeling pressured. They expressed their emotions and their mother hit them?? That’s not ok. Also the parents ruined that not the child. People like that shouldn’t be parents, there’s no excuse for hitting a CHILD
I'm so sorry Cody. Twink death is something so hard to deal with and I want you to know there are people that love you and are rooting for you. And Kelsey, you are so strong...
I was so happy to see Kelsey in another video, im happy for the minutes we got
7:25 mins.... "little girl" is a comedian that does this all the time. I think he changes his voice but also had a filters on it... i remember seeing this years ago. He has different voices so its funny when people fall for it!
My lunch alarm
queen is back sry was back
I'll be watching this
That one about the school was definitely an adult faking their voice haha😂
The adulta acted totally wrong in the video of the dumb ass balloon reveal
I just realized that the memes at the end of the video are because Cody created "Cap That" in college...
Lmao, that kid calling about getting a school knocked down wsd obviously so fake, still funny tho
Cody’s reaction to the balloon video makes no sense, was that a reaction to a different video? I’m confused
Does Cody have a 200 inch TV in the background?
Is Cody in a @strawberry park hoodie?
Love how the game engine forgot your jacket brand so it just says strawberry (like gta 5)
YAY MOM JOINED US FOR LUNCH ❤   edit: I’ve been hoodwinked
Who is this strange man that took over Kelsey’s channel?
Wtf the balloon part was edited wrong
I am CRYING at the eyelash moment and I can't explain why
The baby throwing the bottle reminded me of what my oldest sister said i used to do to her.  There were 6 of us in a 2 bedroom house. All us kids shared one a room. I guess the oldest took care of the youngest. She said I'd take my dirty diapers off and throw them at her when she was sleeping.
How do I get that red Strawberry hoodie.
oh god this reminded me of how my cousin and i used to rip the wings off flies and throw them off the balcony.
😂
30 min ago??? I am so early today 😂 anyway hope yall r enjoying lunch 🫡😚🫶🏻
First kid says it best, "b!tch" - mom obviously wants that kid to learn how to say bad things, which will make that kid become a "b!tch" later on in life. She's smarter than what most of us would understand.
Yes. Yes they are.
We got scammed, we didn't click the thumbnail for Cody
kelsey left??? alright i'm out
MOMMY
I was taught growing up that were no bad words. Just words that hurt and words that are inappropriate for certain situations.  As a result swearing was not a big deal for me,  I could swear if I wanted to, but because it wasn't this big deal I never wanted to!
NOOOOO KLSEEEYYYY
Rich ppl not knowing what cooking hamburger helper looks like 🫤
I remember my son, who's now 42, didn't want to go to school one morning, so he cut up all his pants. Wasn't funny then, hysterical now. 😂  Wait till the teenage years. 🤣😅😂
impeccable timing from my stoogie and i
Hey guys how are you doing
"You can say any bad word in the bathroom." Evil kid: "NI-" 💀
my 2yo daughter gives me the “funny evil” vibes for sure. she’s a sweetheart but knows how to get what she wants 😂
So glad kelsy is joining for lunch today!
saw the title and nothing else. Short answer: Yes  Long answer: abso-fucking-lutely
Cody - today, we are.. Kelsey - HIGHHHH 🤣
Everytime you pull out the Irish accent I have an unwelcome out of body experience.
i have a list of “evil” things i did as a curious kid, including emptying house plants onto the floor, playing in baby powder, emptying cups of water onto the floor, and covering my body with any food i thought could be “lotion,” like yogurt. oh to be young
Here so early the thumbnail hasn’t been perfected yet
Hey I think one of the reactions is backwards? The failed gender reveal has a response about a kid being a thief haha
otis lol that’s so cute🥹

The little girl calling knows the way of the world she was like i'll show em
I click on a vid x10 faster when I see Kelsey in the thumbnail 🧡
Oh I'm early. Hi!
is this a demolition company? or just some big joke factory...
Kids are evil next
15:00 Tim Robinson in a hot dog costume “We’re all trying to find the guy who did this!”
Im sooo fucking happy that u and ur wife got a baby❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ wish yall the best
Guess I’m taking lunch 2 hours early
no thumbnail is scary
very sad we didn't get the duo. But respect it.
uh ripping wings off a fly is pretty concerning, hurting bugs can lead to hurting animals which will lead to hurting people
bro really edged us with his wife?????
The toilet kid had such a wide, diabolical, and adorable smile.
Otis is definitely evil
13k views in 15 min smh, bro fell off fr
cody i don’t even have to watch the video to tell you the answer to that question
Terry the fly said "take my wings, I wanna be a walk"
so nice of Kelsey to let this man take over her video 🥰
yesss
Yeees Kelsey’s back makes any video better Cody glows when she’s around lol
LETS GOOOOO WE'RE SO BACK !!!
The Dublin girl was fucking awesome😂😂
HI KELSEY HI KELSEY HI KELSEY HI KELSEY HI KE
kids are wild i work at an afterschool and one of the kids told me “you’re my favorite counselor even though you’re fat”
kelsey is glowinggg
codys goblin bits are the craziest ive seen a man
the first time im like early enough to cody ko video 😭
I can’t believe Otis is already 19…
That Dublin video is definitely fake😂 Cody, you keep falling for em
EARLY AFFFF
you were late today i already ate lunch
lunch time
Hopefully everydayblessing figured out how to delete the video he accidentally uploaded. 😢
You named your kid after an elevator? LOVE it.
I cannot tell you enough how much I love you guys
YES THEY ARE EVIL!!! some kids were harassing my dogs today
He needs Noel there to tell him stuff like the kid calling in for the school is obviously fake...
9 minutes is crazy
Cody’s ability to put a goblin moment in almost every video is amazing and I love it
Right on time 👍
What y’all having for lunch today??
I actually got so sad when Kelsey left :(
uploaded too early 😞will be watching at lunch
I think most kids just don't understand that words affect others aswell as don't understand everyone has feelings so they just do whatever they want.
right on time for my roasted seasoned potatoes and scrumptious salad
just in time for dinner  yesterday was lunch  Cody is just knows when its food time
I just opened my eyes and boom new video
good vid, just wish it was longer then 6 and a half minutes

Cody picking Kelsey's eyelash off her face and making a wish depressed me, thanks a lot (cries into my pillow) 😞
Answer Yes!! All you had to do is ask! 🤣🤣 I could’ve told you!! 🤣
I wonder what the title will be updated to in about 30 minutes to an hour
excellent video... now press play
ready for dinner
