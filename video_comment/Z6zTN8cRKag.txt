Certainly have to improve the refs for the wnba. Watching offense players being hit hard as they move through their offense sets. The Clark foul that did not happen. Clark was hit hard 3 times as she made moves. The game has to take steps to move the game to the next level. Refs are key to a better game. Also treat all players equal.  Frankie
"she punched someone"  lol.
Im a Sophia fan with her sexy ass...u go girl...TeamCCNSOPHIA
CC got shoved into the ref, who tried to catch her.. and they still didn’t call it lol
Women's basketball and track have turned into a circus. Women in sports have had to fight tooth and nail to get to the level where men are and are still behind as far as respect, fame and money men get and these hood rats are going to ruin it.
These refs are absolutely horrendous and need to be drug into a civil law suit for allowing assaults to happen and not doing anything about it.  A good lawyer would dismantle them in a civil case.  the commissioner or refs are setting themselves up for a good lawsuit.
You can tell that MAN brittney griner that im going to be collecting her molars and displaying them on my mantle
The one knocked Clark down is nasty.
World champion dirt bags!  There is correct it for you.
I watch you all the time, but WTF are you watching? Your sponsors have you by the balls. What a sell out.
Do synchronized swimming type plays and wear tight outfits. If they're not in a mud pit I dont need to watch women fight.
More physical than the men's league 😂😂😂
the long fingernails need to be banned. period
Sophie Cunningham, my Hero. You go girl
Caitlin should take her game to Europe.  F the WNBA.
God the skill pf Caitln is awesome. The well honed basic skills and lack of flashy crap does actually sell tickets . Who'd a thunk it.  Unfortunately the rules is the rules and an ejection in this case is valid.  The issue is turning a blind eye to blatant fouls on Caitlin
Clarke needs to be protected from The racists
Thank goodness for Sophie perhaps they need to dump some of the other team members that stood by and have watched Catlin get smashed. Get more team players 💪
Cc does run her mouth a lot though. She can back it up but that doesn’t mean other players won’t take exception to it.
Wnba needs more Cunningham
Does anyone else find it interesting that both eye pokes on Caitlin Clark were from the Connecticut Sun teams? They can't stop her with good sportsmanship so they go to take out her eyes.
Is the WNBA the 90s NBA now which is way better than the 2025 baby NBA
Dude, sophie cunningham can GET IT holy mama
CC needs to pull a Jordan and put on like 30 pounds of muscle over this off-season
women hate a successful woman. Take any handful of caitlins games, play the tape for anybody  on the planet who doesnt know basketball.... willing to bet theyy will end up asking why everyone  doesnt like the one player.  its beyond sports... its women being women on a primitive lvl
So many YouTubers are trying to make their own story out of this event (sigh). Not you guys, all others tho
When Sophie enter the game they need to play the final countdown song   Indian paid a lot of to bring her from Phoenix and bought out her contract and gave one draft pick to phoenix
Black women and white lesbians upset that a straight white woman is taking the spotlight.
The rest of Caitlins teamates are afraid of having her back. They don't want to get black balled by the rest of the league. The refs are in the same boat as well.
Women's basketball is stupid because women are idiots.  The 19th amendment didn't free women from anything it enslaved men to them.  Im sick and fn tired of being a slave to dumb women.
Caitlin and Sophie are monsters, and contrary to the opinion of Angel Reese, they are the only reason I even pay attention to the WBNA.
Boys not for nothing but this has to much to do with frigging race than the game that’s why she’s getting a beating it’s because she’s awesome but white so that can’t be possible and the wnba wouldn’t be much without Clark sorry most of them are awful at ball
I don't expect anything different from Indiana fever's fans like you after all the home of the ku klu Klux Klan I bet you are a member
First of all you're a liar what this is is white on white crime
Only way to protect her really because some were having free reign with cheap stuff
It's about time someone on Indiana protected CC. 😤
I love how their answer to the “all she is is a pretty white girl” argument is to bring in a pretty white girl enforcer.
NEVER let someone disrespect you 💪🏻💪🏻 Great job Sophie
Caitlin Curry Clark aka Triple C
Madrey got payback. 😂😂😂 Clark bodychecked her facefirst into the seats. While Madrey was bent over. If Clark is going to play aggressive and get techs, she will receive them too.  I4NI
Haters are going to hate. There's a serious petition to suspend Sophie.
You literally have a apples vs apples comparison one gets ejected and a flagrant foul the other gets nothing and the chick that went after her eyes get a tech
Sorry ass refs let these cheap shots keep happening! This needs to be addressed!!!
Chick lowed her shoulder to initiate contact. Sophie wrapped to stop the shot. Sophie didn't back down from the refs' goons. Woulda happened without Caitlin.
Sophie’s a scrapper with a reputatiom for puttin’ divas and hoes in check since her college days. She’s like Doc Holliday in Tombstone. If you wanna play for blood that’s just her game and she’s got a black belt to back it up.
i vote Sophie on WNBA all star ballot
Let’s go CC!!! A Dawg
Only 2 things r interesting in the wnba Clark and Turner😂
The jealousy of Clark is embarrassing for the wnba kudos to Cunningham for defending her
Im now a sophie cunningham fan now. But saying that a 6 year old blackbelt sounds rediculous. Must be a fake martial art. Having a blackbelt at the age of 6 is like saying you got a black belt under the Nogueira brother, like saying a got a free toy in my happymeal.
Why doesn't any new people call for the commissioner be fired what the hell is wrong with you people
Imagine constantly trying to injure the gravy train that is the only reason anyone even talks about this worthless sport.
The Refs thought this was UFC not WNBA and maybe this is the way the W needs to go to get attention. Putting new meaning into the call “Let’s Get Ready to RUMBLE!”. GANGSTER BASKETBALL
100% honest. Caitlin had my attention, Sofie now has me tuning in. 🍿
This is all I want from basketball
Let alone Sophie is gorgeous
Bringing back the days when women stood up for each other. Today it’s all backstabbing 😢
What was Sophie thinking?  She waited until the last possible moment to get Sheldon as she knew she would be ejected.  Smart thinking.  I loved it!!  They complain the Sheldon didn't see it coming.  Neither did Caitlin when shoved by as..... Mabrey but was she rejected?  Need some consistency with the refs.
WNBA better get their officiating in check asap!!!
Ya just don't phuc with Indiana teams.  Go FEVER
Its gotta make that one black player mad that the 3 players at the top of everyones mind are CC, Lexie, and Sophie. 😂😂😂😂
Have you seen the AI vide where its Sophie talking after the game and say shes going to choke slam her like "circa 1990s Undertaker." Let me tell you, Id pay good money to watch Sophie do that to CCs enemies.
I would like to be perfectly clear… Sophie Cunningham did receive a black belt in taekwondo, when she was six. After receiving this achievement, she hasn’t touched it since.
Cunningham is doing what any teammate should do in this instance. Most of those other girls on the team should not even call themselves teammates
Let them fight. Sophie snatches necks like a hockey player
Very nice work, Sophie!  Every player on the Fever roster from last year should feel ashamed that they were unwilling to step up and protect their teammate the way Sophie has.  If the Fever management has any sense, they will find some more players like Sophie and get rid of those that are too cowardly or too jealous or too racist to stand-up for CC when she is being assaulted.
When are they going to learn, you don't upset Clark and just think you're going to get into her head or whatever. If anything, it wakes her ass up and she starts destroying the opposing team with highlight after highlight!
Sophie is a G. And fine as hell.
Having the splash and the bash sisters on the same team is wild.
Cunningham played football
Can we get a pic of James & Sophie together
get Sophie on the show.
Sophie used to play football :)
your thoughts re the game needing azzholes is pathetic, you meathead - its not basketball, go watch a fight if you want to watch a fight
The WNBA is the biggest joke in sports. The most mismanaged league in professional sports. Instead of bringing credibility to their sport and capitalizing on what Clark has brought to the league they have allowed hatred, jealousy, and racism to be their legacy. The resentment is unreal. Refs won’t blow the whistle because they are afraid to be showing racially motivated favoritism. Unreal because of how in the NBA, just breathing on a guy gets a foul call. Paige isn’t getting beat because all eyes are on CC and she is an East coast girl from the Geno tree. CC went to a small Midwest school, easy to come after her based on some biases because she ain’t from the powerhouses. I see enough from a distance but I will never give a league full of such trash and hatred any of my money. WNBA should keep CC on her feet and handle these things before they lose their league to the Griners and Swoopes minded souls. Don’t worry about my money, WNBA. You ain’t getting any of it.
Caitlin Clark- Michael Jordan  Sophie Cunningham- Dennis Rodman
Sophie low key baddie ... I'd go up on her
Bill Lambere would be proud
When they attacked Clark the only one to stand up for her was Hull and I thought it was very disappointing to see Boston and the others do absolutely nothing, which says almost as much as Cunningham defending her. Watching Cunningham go after her with such aggression was awesome to see and great to see her do a little damage as well. Looked good on that girl to be a bit marked up and get shown up. Good on hull and Cunningham to do what they did I'm sure Clark will never forget that. I play hockey and have fought and defended my teammates and was treated with loads of respect by all the players after that. On the field, ice, court, field we're brothers and sisters and should 100% have each other's backs.
Get Sophie on the show live. Get out of the studio and have a kick competition with Sophie
I love it too! lol
Love that the players aren't looking to the refs after every move and making them be responsible for keeping order
About time her team mates start sticking up for her
terrible basketball
You don’t see any eye gouging in the NBA, why is that. This rough housing with CC as a welcome to the WNBA has got to stop. Hazing is against the law and has no business in sports. If you want to play dirty, expect the same. There should be no special treatment. The referees should be fired and NBA officials should be brought in. The petition to kick Sophie out of the league is laughable. Go simp somewhere else.
Commissioner Cathy is using refs to put Caitlin’s dominance in check
These women are playing physical . I love it . Nba
What would happen if someone should injured CC to a point that her career is cut short? I would pity the person who injure CC in such a manner. Perhaps the whole of the WNBA will crash down upon her and her career may be at jeopardy.
Sophie is my girl  , BAD ASS !
Gotta get Sophie Cunningham on the show
Caitlin needs an enforcer and Sophie stepped up.  Also whoever #10 was in that initial clip after she got hit in the eye.  She looked ready to throw down.
we need sophie mic’d up
Nobody would know Maybrys fukin name if she didnt attach herself to Caitlin..HEY MABRY YOU COULDNT BEAT CAITLIN IN COLLEGE AND YOU CANT BEAT HER NOW..YOUR OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE YOU COULDNT BE A PIMPLE ON CCs ASS!!!!+±+
Yeah, she needs more team mates to step up and protect her when she gets cheap shots with no calls.
Legend. Buying a jerseyv
if the refs won't do their job, somebody else will.
I don’t like the cheap shots, BUT I love the physicality. I want more of this in the NBA, please.
If the refs were to ref the fight like hockey the WNBA would be the most watched sport on earth.
She will reset the WNBA if Fever win the chip.
No I'm sorry but they've already made it clear that they don't want our money. Let them go back to playing to nobody
It's about time the black lesbian mafia be called out for the hugs that they are.
I could think of another basketball player that should have stayed in Russia
I stand with Caitlin Clark.
I dont even watch the nba nebermind the wnba but now i want a clark and cunningham shirt...league/refs  GET YOUR SHAT TOGETHER!
This actually helps WNBA for views. If they protect Caitlin too much, no body’s gonna watch it
Caitlin between your hand and your shoulder there is a elbow you need to start using it!!
It actually starts with the grabbing thats easy to see. The refs let the snowball grow into a ball of flames. Then a molotv goes off
She'll be alright, Jackie Robinson went through worse
Watching Caitlin and Sophie grow...kinda reminds me of when Sue Bird and Lauren Jackson melded in Seattle. Could be a dynasty if nurtured.
She’s not a needle mover……………….she is the needle
If the refs won’t do their job somebody else WILL
thank god we got the enforcer this year!! I knew that's why they got sophie. and she is protecting CC like NO ONE did last year.
"Cuz they're talking about holding out" *hides laughter 🤣
That neck control..... ready to drop in a knee or 2! Love it.  Sophie cool and controlled holding 1 neck and not concerned about the other player coming at her
This why there’s fighting in hockey
LETS GO OKC!
CAITLIN JOIN THE EUROPEAN LEAGUE...WHY BE TREATED THIS WAY
The fact she earned a black belt at age 6 is gonna cost some cocky thug some dental work someday
Wow no racist comments anywhere geez i wonder why ????? o yeah thats right it WASN'T THE BLK GIRLS DOING IT THIS TIME!!! Cunningham should get the same thing REECE GOT!! Why cant u all pretend it was that Canday girl or whatever where is the pure hate and virtue???? So its ok for Sophie to push Gods child Cc down but not anyone else especially of color.
as Dave Skylark said; “they hate us cus they aint us”
I don't really understand why the wnba (and the players) are allowing Clark to get messed with. She is making them so much money right now.
Sophie was a kicker/football player in high school
“And you’ll eat the deck a little bit” 😂😂😂
Yo Pat you need to get Sophie on the show bro
"...dirtbag Detroit Pistons..." A yo watch ya mouth! ur confused...its u thats wearing the DB cap lol! its DETROIT VS EVERYBODY!  all day er day baby! dig me!
CC needs one more enforcer in addition to Sophie.  I think Timpson would be great for that role.
Nah White women can be thugs too
W CUNNINGHAM
legalized racism
How did CC get a technical after Sheldon chest bumped her AFTER the eye-poke?
This is all an act to try to convince people the WNBA is watchable and that Clark isn't the most annoying flopper outside of LeBron. The WNBA is a joke.
Things U Need 2 Know, the Stars of the WNBA League Merchandise is Not Being Moved @ WaL-Mart & Target so Wut Their Promoters Done Was Giv Away Their Merchandise Free Wen U Buy CaitLand CLark Kent Merchandise . Ain't That Some Krap. A Toast of Champagne 4U 💃🏀🔥🍷🍾🍹📸👀💳🖥️💯
That was a muay thai neck clinch for sure lol. And she wasn't worried about it at all lol!
Maybe Griner can get Sheldon a contract with Russia? She'd make a good prison cellmate?
I love what she did getting revenge for catlin I love catlin
you did not hold back your laughter at the thought of them holding out good enough
One mistake Pat made was referring this to Professionals
CC is the MJ of women basketball. Already breaking years long records. In 42 games.
The Fever court looks like a NASCAR. All the advertisements on the floor!!!!
I love how Pat almost laughed when he said “players might sit out during new CBA.” They think they should get millions when they lose money every damn year.
Sophia is a THUGGGG and don't belong in the leauge...she needs to be in jail
Does AJ Hawk ever say anything, or do they just put him on screen for shits and giggles?
Keep up the Caitlin breakdowns!!!🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀
Screw off calling the Pistons dirtbags.  They were champs, and one of the few teams to win back to back!
Hello, Humans Do what you want in life, because you never know when your last day is.  TERRANCE OUT
Wnba refs are worthless
The ref are a joke
This whole charade is no different than Pro Wrestling. The WNBA is desperate for ratings/viewers. Fights and controversies will draw more attention than 10 women playing basketball.
2:43 I knew Sophie was going to deliver some retaliation before the end of the game as soon as CC got body checked. Absolutely an enforcer as well as a talented two-way player. Very Draymond Green to me.
Love Clark she’s a beast love Sophia Cunningham she’s awesome as well!!
CC just needs to hire the Jokic Brothers to follow her around. That'll handle it.
I need a Cunningham jersey
Sophie ain't no joke, Don't play with her like that. we all saw how that went down.
JC Sheldon has to act out because she's an absolute nobody that averages 6 points a game. 👎 And Marina Mabrey is a big wide body that shoots three-pointers like a 5-year-old trying to get it to the hoop from half court.🤣🤣🤣🤣 It's really spazzy.
CC should play for the NBA. These lil girls are out of her league
Sophie Cunningham looks like she can give the WWE Women's Division a boost!
The WNBA is a trash product, the fact that the NBA commissioner hasnt stepped in and told the WNBA to get their ish straight is stupid.  I know this is how Jordan was treated when he first came into the league, the Pistons were allowed to mug the man, but the NBA was a prime product and apparently the fans loved the war.  All this bad officiating does is turn new people off, the only people who want to watch this crap are people who want to see more female MMA.  Review the refs, fire the useless ones.
When did the three stooges eye gouge become legal?  I seen quit a few of them on all different teams.
She doesn't have the talent to stand out, volume shooter who travels a lot
Sophie is hott!
WNBA is the old school NBA. NBA is old school WNBA.
THE SWORD AND THE SHIELD
It’s about friggen time! SEND THE JIMS!!!!YOU CANT LET THEM COME TO YOUR BARN AND RUN AROUND LIKE THAT!!!!! Nobody runs around like that in our barn!!!  It’s the same with SGA old school ball would have hurt him…. FRIGGEN SEND THE JIMS!!!!!!
Candice Parker didn’t experience what CC is experiencing! Facts!
Well Coloreds all stick together and the White Women who are the true best in the league and need to be standing up for each other and not kowtowing to these Coloreds
1:11 is why i love Pat. Couldn't help but to laugh when saying they may hold out for a CBA 😅😅😅
The fact that she will enter her prime in 2029. is scary
Lower the net by 4".....we need them to be able to dunk.
She stood up for humanity against the thugs.
1st off big up sophie that's how you be a teammate... give her a max deal..... 2nd these ladies are out there rabbit ass minds as my folks used to say... you're about to be negotiating a new cba and your going out your way to kill the golden goose not saying they shouldn't compete that makes the game good you should want to beat her everytime but you should never want to hurt her.... if she gets a career ending injury because of the bs cheapshots you guys are back to busses coach flights and playing for pennies.... don't yall like 1st class flights private jets sold out arenas... yeah course they do lol that's all Catlin you gotta protect the money its just good business
Okay, I am not a basketball fan, but I am a CC fan and I get tired of people saying that she’s not that special. Who else can drop threes from more than 30 feet? And three threes in 38 seconds. She’s the Lionel Messi of women’s basketball. I can see that from the far side of the world.  Jacy Sheldon is good at being a dirty player and nothing else.

I've not seen anyone call this out, but just before Cunningham wraps her up and takes her down, Sheldon initiates the contact, lowering her shoulder and driving right into Cunningham. It's Sheldon who does the dirty and Cunningham merely responded in kind. No one seems to have noticed that. Going for a layup, the last thing one would do is lower the shoulder and barrel into the defender. This was all on Sheldon.
Clark needs to start wearing goggles if the WNBA refuses to stop the eye poking.
Bird never would have put up with this type of treatment.
Sophie Cunningham is TOTALLY HOT!!! And FREAKING AWESOME 💯💪🤨💯💯💯
I wish the WNBA would put a team back in Detroit
Clark is the only reason more than 100 people watch a WNBA game. Sophie understood the assignment.
You know, more fans might tune in if you start having games/series with some feeling/rivalry. If the other team starts targeting your teammates you have to bring the lumber.
I agree a bit of physicality is fine but cheap shots aren't cool. Sophie is awesome by the way
Sophie had her black belt when she was 6 yrs old in the state of Missouri
The league has some kind of plan to allow “accidents” because it IS so sloppy, but see what happens when you allow something so subjective. There would be an insufferable amount of fouls and slow play if they called the game straight-up, but the players know that now and think hmm I’ll just roll the dice and maybe won’t be called. And they’re right to think that, it might not. Just gotta call fouls, end of story. I actually like the fights but it ain’t right.
There’s about to be a wnba malice in the palace. Hopefully McAfee will get me some tix
She is an animal and I love it.
Lmao 😅😂🤣 The WNBA That's what you're hyping up? I'd rather watch paint dry.  Hey, are you going to pay Aaron Rodgers to "stop by" again this year ???
Sophie Cunningham jerseys sold out after that game btw
If they only had a competent commissioner.
Do you ever get the feeling that the WNBA is a tax write off for the NBA and that's why they don't care if CC gets hurt? Seems like making money isn't what it was created for.
Hey what about Reggies or Kareems goggles
I wish she would stop the MJ tongue thing
So every other league on the planet comes in after a BS penalty and slams down some FINES and poof like magic people get some act right in their lives... however, the WNBA doesn't seem to have the ability or sense to manage their own league... let's see some fines, a couple suspensions... then see how many of these women want to act the fool...  Spank that wallet, and you make that ass mind.
It's a disgrace. Your a horrible channel. I bet you will be happy when they make Clark a disabled.
Pat almost broke character mentioning the CBA stance they threatened to take 😂😂😂
The Fever are actually turning the games into family outings .Enjoying the bonding as a family .The entire Fever org is a  Class act top to bottom .Parents are comfortable with there kids watching and learning and DREAMING  all the possibilities
If you watch slow motion replay very closely, and I had to watch multiple times, offensive player lowered shoulder and went a foot or 2 sideways to ram Sophie at exactly the same time she was trying to tie her up.  It’s seriously a very difficult play to call because looked like a cheap shot, but happened at exactly the same time she was being rammed by shoulder down offensive player.  I feel like one of these plays that, in nba, refs would watch repeatedly in nba and nba announcers would call in retired ref to explain call because these two things happened at the same time, and might have been completely accidental because thrown off balance and timing messed up by being rammed sideways with lowered shoulder.  This shoulder makes the call extremely difficult…if she had not done, this, yes, flagrant foul, but because she did this, I simply have no clue what call should be
I don't understand why the WNBA players are trying to take out their meal ticket
CC should issue a formal legal notice to the Commissioner, holding her personally liable for any failure to remedy the ongoing conditions that imperil CC’s safety, for which the WNBA is duty-bound to ensure protection from foreseeable injury. Failure to address these hazards will likely result in further harm to CC.  Such legal notice will impose liability upon the Commissioner for neglecting the statutory responsibility to provide a safe working environment, as required by applicable State and Federal law. Upon receipt of this notice, the Commissioner is obligated to take prompt corrective action to mitigate and eliminate the foreseeable risks, particularly in light of the substantial evidence already in the public domain.  Moreover, the propagation of a narrative that “trash talking” confers upon players the right to assault CC effectively incites behavior that could lead to a riot, thereby exposing CC and others to serious injury. This is a grave legal matter that must be addressed with the utmost urgency and seriousness.  I submit this opinion with the benefit of over 38 years of legal professional experience.
sophie is boss status
Since Caitlin Stepped in to the WNBA they applied Jordan Rule to her. Everyone was on her even the referees. But Caitlin Clark is different, she is the GOAT and her team is the best WNBA Team. I love them all and Sophie  her guardian angel and Lexie the archer. AJ too and Mitchell. They will be the Champion 2025 and WNBA will be as big as the NBA.
Pat you forgot the important part of that whole interaction which upset your own critique..  1)  When did Caitlyn get eyestruck?  When did Sophie get the payback hit?  (yes, it was deserved payback).. not until the game was all but wrapped up (46.1 seconds and a 17 point lead)..   which means she got payback AFTER her team pretty much locked in the win.    Then payback came back.  Now  other players are going to have to say "do i take the chance and get killed at end of the game"?  2)_    But how can you say you "like" what connecticut did?  (Unless you're referring to the end of game scene, and i have no problem with players taking the hard block/tackle personally).    An eye poke NOWHERE near the ball?  If it was a good clean hard foul.. fine, but that was anything but.
The referees let this game get out of control. The referees have been horrible for a while now and they turn a blind eye to a lot of stuff that happens to CiCi and now she’s got an enforcer and now some petty ass people have a petition going to get Sophie Cunningham kicked out of the league. If that’s the case that I wanna see Brittney Griner kicked out of the league this racism in the WNBA towards white people need to stop or they’re gonna be broke and nobody’s gonna be playing professional basketball as a female.
I believe it would be good for the fever to offer a contact to chennedy carter. She's a pitbull who can play, she'd be grateful for the chance to be back in the wnba,  and a chance to play with the fever. WITH caitlin clark.
Let's talk about how bad these referees were
Keep the refs in the WNBA. If you fire them, they may go to the MLB or NFL.
That muay thai clinch was slick. I was just waiting for her to unleash the knees and elbows. That's how you deal with punks.
All the fans need to boycott the WNBA, encourage Caitlin Clark to go overseas and find a basketball league that will treat her with respect. Is finally put this train wreck to bed, and let Caitlin go off on her own and thrive. Isn't like we can't follow her overseas, so I'm all for boycotting WNBA and encouraging Caitlin to focus on her safety and also her financial future, by going overseas. That's my two cents.
Typical female interactions.
Sophie Cunningham is not a GOON but a competitive player who stands up for herself and her teammates. Sophie is a scorer, defender, leader and an enforcer. She is the Full Package.
Somebody should ask another great shooter @Jackie Stiles if this style of play is what shortened her career? CC is bigger but hopefully she doesn't suffer the same fate of a shortened career because of injuries... Love Sofie standing on business!
They need to ban long fingernails for sure.
I guess that's why these refs are working in the WNBA instead of THE NBA.
Sure Caitlin is skilled. But only in comparison to non skilled females. I am 36 and haven't played basketball competitively in over 18 years and I'd still beat her in a one on one. 100% of the time.
Sophie is foxy
2:40  If a white person said that, they’d probably be canceled.
"I love it..."             FINALLY, BACK UP BITCHES.
I've been looking at literally dozens of takes since the night before last, for someone to have noticed what was so EASY to see. That Sheldon has this cartoonishly evil grin on her face as she drives into Sophie's chest with a lowered left shoulder to slam into her as she goes up for the bucket, and Sophie just uses her own momentum to send her to the floor. Sophie's foul shouldn't  have been upgraded. Sheldon's should've for having that same evil grin as she's body checking CC right after poking her in the eye, causing CC to push her off. Why hasn't ANYONE covering this mentioned it?!
Sophie Cunningham name is now on the Map. No one should ever try to hurt CC even again.
How much coke is Pat on? Every time I see the dude he's standing up ranting lol
Yes, with a CBA coming up lets try to injure the best player in the league that is making it anywhere near relevant and making us more money than ever before.
WMBA is a joke
They should play in bikinis.
Sophie's defensive Taekwondo instinct in taking down Sheldon gently who tried to drive her shoulder into Sophie.
Caitl<n Clark needs teammates who stand up for her.
The rookie thing is over. Now shes got protection. Go CC!
Let’s not lie, people (men) LOVE it that a white girl with long blonde hair that doesn’t look like a dude got rowdy and took up for her white teammate that doesn’t look like a dude either.
Let a naysayer know! 🙌🤣
The Most Entertaining WNBA Game i've seen, and its just the clips!
That Mabrey chick is annoying. She's plays rough and sometimes dirty but has a problem when other do it? She can dish it out but can't take it? Weak.
Gonna need a Sophie Cunningham poster now.......
I love Sophie lol
Remember, “Hey, it’s basketball. It’s a physical game.”
Commissioners cup is a preview of the finals.
You like that!?!!
Talking about comparing to NBA Enforcers in MJ era, can’t help but think of Dennis Rodman
The fact that Caitlin teammates just stood there after that one player knocked her over, kind of makes me never wanna watch the wnba
And EVERY TEAMMATE BUT SOPHIE is absolutely PATHETIC!! ZERO have stood up for her! Scared or jealous! Or BOTH!!
Refs have GOT to be paid off to suck soooo bad!! They’re f*cking HORRID!!
Caitlin 'The Play Maker' Clark
Rivalry's great? Yeah if they're of the same caliber this Connecticut team is coal whereas the Fever is gold. It's not a rivalry for Connecticut it's just cheap and dirty jealousy.
Let um play
NONE of this would have ever happened had the weak-ass refs had called any of the three body checks that happened before the (intentional) face gauge.
WNBA should allow what hockey does to get this under control.  This is turning people off as we want hard basketball not thug life
Sophie Cunningham should "put on the foil" before each game.  The bullying of CC will stop.
I’m hoping that Sophie is Caitlin’s version of Rodman. All force and no fucks given.
It’s a black thing. They hate white mamba
Those cheap shots, especially to the face and eyes must be punished with suspensions. Someone could end CC's career with an eye jab. It's not funny, it's not a minor foul. It should be handled in a serious manner.
For all of the CC and Fever haters out there:  Caitlin Clark is better than your favorite WNBA player, and always will be!  The Indiana Fever are the most watched and beloved team in the WNBA right now by their fans, so get over it!
WNBA is such a joke lmfao
It's the WNBA that is promoting Bullying...They are pretty much telling young boys and girls this is how the proffessionals do it it's ok to bully and not have sportsmanship. The WNBA is responsible they have condoned all of it. Do you want your kids to learn this type of sportsmanship? Do you want your kids bullied because they have talent that others dont?
WNBA has enforcers like Hockey lmao
Cc need to start taking up for her own self then maybe she'll stop getting thrown around like a rag doll hit the weight room but i get it yall need something to cheer for
The girls that hate her are making Caitlin must c TV for men like me lolol
She is like Freddie Mercury a little. There are other singers that rocked like he did, but that man had a tremendous talent for connecting with crowds and it skyrocketed Queen. There are some players that play as good as Caitlin but she is wild in how she gets the stadium up on their feet. That is what the WNBA needs, because by and large most of us don't give two craps about the WNBA... but we are starting too just a little.
I would love it if Caitlin Clark starts talking about retiring or going to Europe. It would teach those spoiled women brats a lesson (right as collective bargaining begins) because everyone knows the League would fold back into hum-drum  mediocrity without her. The fans would boycott everything about the League, and the Commissioner would be run out of town for not addressing the flagrant fouls. (Brittney Griner needs to go back to Russia for a refresher course on humility as well)
I haven't been even thinking about the NBA and I can't believe the WNBA has taken over my small, sports brain.
Sheldon doesn't know how lucky she is, Sophie grabs her behind the head and pulls her head down, it's called a Mauy Tai Clinch, and is usually followed by some hard knees to the face.  Fortunately for Sheldon, Sophie only gave her a good verbal warning not to mess with her or any of her teammates, she easily could have sent her home with a broken nose...
Am I to believe that Sofie Cunningham is ah…DAWG?!
God forbid any basketball is ever played in the WNBA
Since when was body checking someone part of basketball?  It seems more like a hockey kind of thing to me.
All you need is Clark and 4 enforcer/rebounders.
sophie is Clarks personal McSorley .   for you youngsters, McSorely was the goon who protected Gretsky.    if you messed with Wayne, McSorley was after you for the rest of the season.
Clark needs to keep letting that fire out!  as for the Black belt at 6 years old is silly. cmon ... But she is a good add to the team.
Sophie was the punter for the high school
That Sophie Cunningham is one piece of ace.
:36 black belt at the age of 6 is not possible by any respectable martial arts facility. It takes a minimum of 3 years and most of the time there’s also a minimum age requirement like 10 or 12 years old
This fever team is so much better than last year's team
Requirements to be a WNBA official:  1) Blind 2) Deaf 3) No experience 4) Incompetent
A blackbelt in taekwondo at the age of 6? The first in the state of Missouri. Love Sophie as the enforcer. Her jerseys sold out in a day.
Unironically more entertaining than their league 😂
You'd think the refs would protect their league's meal ticket if her teammates arent...
Sophie Cunningham, Bravo for you.  It was well-done!  Wise
I think most people would agree the eye poke was an accident. Hard to poke someone accurately in the eye at high speed. The body check after was wrong. The throw down and clinch by fever player at the end was definitely wrong but deserved. Physicality is good for the sport. Awful reffing. Play physical not dirty. But damn entertaining.
Love this ALL around.  GREAT look for the W
I'll say what everyone else is scared to say. Its Ratchet ass black women being racist. No one wants to call it how it is, its a culture issue in America with how these black women behave. Point blank simple.
WNBA isn't on the rise. Catlin Clark is on the rise!
Crazy good you like the team. Maybe you can join the team and make a lot of tackles on a losing team
Sorry to say as a kicker i seen for years you're a jackass,by the way nice tackle on that kick return
Notice how sophie was the only standing up for CC?  The Fever still have some major issues internally.
A foul on a non basketball play should result in a ejection
Indiana called in a Viking to take care of these trash girls
Caitlin is a DOG!🎉
he was really trying not to laugh when he mentions the girls "holding out"
Cunnhingham getting her in the clinch is wild
These white girls are literally saving the wnba
The wayxsophie wrapped sheldons head up was perfect. Obviously the black belt kicked in but i still like to think she watched mighty ducks and learned the fight technique there 😂c
More of the team needs to step up and play more like Shophie, good on ya girl for protecting the mvp of your team. Sophie has been a wonderful addition to Caitlin and I wish their team all the best this season. I'm routing for yall ladies! And not to mention Sophie is a smoke show as well, I really enjoy the wnba now that they have real women playing very well. Even better than some of the dudes in the wnba.
Until you hold black racist accountable it will get way worse.  Cant just call out white racism.  Gotta keep it a buck or get bucked on
There will be a career ending injury if you keep attacking a player's eyes. Can the WNBA afford to lose CC?... That was a rhetorical question, in case you missed it. I support good basketball play, not this BS. On a personal note, I am so proud of my distant cousin. Go Lexie!
CC won’t last at this rate unless she has enforcers like Wayne Gretzky had throughout his career. Different sports but same premise.
Lexie and Dantas both should get kudos too. They were getting in there for CC too!
Bring in some NBA refs. "Let a Nay-sayer Know" 😂
We’ve got SOPHIE FEVER❣️
Without a doubt, Sophie is the bomb! Like you keep FA and she's gonna be there when you FO! I love everything about Sophie, and I am ecstatic that she is playing with CC! The Fever is loaded with talent, and if they keep this up I dare say this could become a dynasty! 🤘😎
The MOMENT the Fever brought Cunningham in, I knew it was to protect Clark. Not even a slight doubt. Great player, fierce competitor, and can drop anyone in the league that hurts her team. This is just the start. Last season they just mocked and criticized Clark. That didn't work. This season they WILL get physical. The fragile little egos of the W-clan don't know what to do, so this is the result. Buckle up, it's going to get worse before it gets better. Good for Clark being so resilient. I love Sophie even more now that she's stepping up, saying essentially, we're not going to take this SH*T! OH, and one more thing. Sophie Cunningham, as a side bonus, might also be the missing link to take the Fever to the promised land and win it all, and I'm here for all of it.
Must watch TV
Gotta love Sophie Cunningham. Please VOTE for Sophie Cunningham on All Star Team
Now Mabry needs some schooling.  The “don’t f with Caitlin school” is open.
CC is not just a needle mover...she is the needle. Just like Tiger.
No Major League Rugby..... ALOT of good action in the MLR - Go Free Jacks
Get more goons on that Fever team. If they aren’t about protecting Caitlin then they are not serious about wanting that paycheck.
She's a 14th degree black belt now who just got recertified. She's built for this.
Being a blackbelt at the age of 6 is not a flex. It just means she went to a McDojo. I really dont get how people are bragging about this. Just stop and think about it for one second.
Pat always trying to play both sides.  Stop trying to make excuses for dirty ass play.
She is the W Steph Curry/MJ for marketing
Dude.. this is atrocious. Those women are pathetic. Envious bitter low iq heffers who cant stand that there is a dominant star that the world loves. IMAGINE if men acted that way in the nba to lebron or sga... the wnba is becoming more and more of a complete joke
They are green face with JEALOUSLY.  Those girls will NEVER be at Caitlin & Sophie's level.  Zero contest here...... WNBA is NOTHING without Caitlin.  NOTHING.
Until CC, I had NEVER watched a single second of a WNBA game, nor did I ever think I would. But now that I do, I've discovered how good players like Sonia Citron, Kiki Iriafen, Sabrina Ionescu, Napheesa Collier etc etc are. The league is doing it's best to shoot itself in the foot, and kill the golden goose in the process.
Love the scrappiness of the Fever. Kelsey Mitchell is a grinder - great PG. Hull is a shut down defender - total grinder. Bonner and Howard plays hard ball. Boston incredible on the post. Great composition of the team.
Fever need to sign one player just to come in and be an enforcer for CC. The amount of fouls she’s been getting are very MJ and Lebron -esque
All these racists blacks had left was sports. Now they’re watching that slip through their 3 inch nails. Beautiful to watch.
Sophie is a DIME
She’s our Jackie Robinson
also keep in mind Sophie is a farm girl used to dealing with cattle which is why she has no problem dealing with heifers
You could tell Sophie knew how to fight by the way she clinched her behind the neck.
how can you stand watching this trash lmfao its high school drama mix with facebook and half ass sports when the score is 80 to 40 every other game lmfao. you ppl arnt sports fans you ppl are greedy scum bags
im starting to see why ole dude from pheonix risked it all🤣
LANK Caitlyn!  (Let a naysayer know)
Man I can't say how much I love Sophie protect your star player she was ready for the smoke.
So Mcafee ok with Sheldon digging claws into CC’s arm, grabbing, holding and pushing the whole game. Those are all fouls.
Caitlin  is great player, but she doesn’t do herself any favors with her soccer flops.
If this was any other player we wouldn't be talking about this situation. That shows that CC is the face of the WNBA and if any of them women were intelligent, they would hop on and ride this train to the sun.
Just a bunch of angry black lesbians
I wish Boston would behave a little tougher
Gretzky had McSorley, Clark has Cunningham.
that joke of a league doesn t deserve CC...
I don't even watch basketbal... casual Youtube clip watcher... but Caitlyn is a golden goose for the WNBA.   Seeing what Sophie did made me admire her.  She's a team mate you want on your side and it doesn't hurt that she's also stunning.  What a woman!
6:50 It's understandable that Pat is supporting Caitlin because she looks like his daughters. However, Caitlin carries the ball when she dribbles. The ball is up near her face. Poke to the eye was unintentional. Stop the crying.
Basketball Barbie ain't afraid to throw Hands
White girls dont have to jump
So y'all are saying everyone should just sit back and watch her shoot? She just should never be touched at all?
Caitlin Clark has enough money and notoriety to walk from the WNBA and put them back into poverty status.
The NBA has bored me for years. Especially when CCP LeBron got political.   Boring.     That game I just happened to take a glance and LOVED IT.   Sophie, Lexie, CC?     Yes please.    What Sophie did made me a fan.     GO FEVER!
I think Sophine fought her cause of the last time they faced them. She played dirty
Get rid of all the WOKE refs! They totally suck.
Dirt bag Pistons😂
This is simple.. wnba is racist against anyone thats not black. Same in nba... racists
You can't beat up talent
Sophie also was the place kicker on her high school football team.
At 2:50, what is he talking about? No WNBA has had to deal with the mauling and assualt that Caitlin has.
The day CC leaves the WNBA will be the last day we have to hear about the WNBA.
Straight up, I love Sophia Cunnigham. She was the only reason I watched the Mercury. She is a bad ass and hottt. The way the refs are towards indiana and especially Clark is just flat out ridiculous. Bunch of petty and jelous bitc hes 😂
Sophie is a Baller, she payed football too !! 100% Mad respect for that girl good for her for standing Tall =))
Your not even allowed to eye gouge in the UFC so why was that player not ejected.
MIZ
I am now a fan of the Indiana fever,not just cc.angel bb 🦒 is the comic relief😂
Sophie Cunningham= DAWG
You can't all be a Catlin. When you can't be a Catlin, be a Sophia.
Eye gouging and dead ball cheap shots must stop. WNBA needs to fine women for that stuff.
Aside from CC's gameplay the female drama is the only entertainment coming from the WNBA
The blatant racism in the WNBA is wild
New Sophie Cunningham Fan here!  🥰😍😍🤩
Candace Parker! Don’t forget Lauren Jackson.
You said you did not approve of the eye poke or the blindside knock down, but it is precisely those plays that caused the problem. Call out the Sun for the bush league cowardly players that they are.
Oh yeah baby! Put some bikinis on and we'll have the WNBA'S version of lingerie football! 😊
Imagine if that happened to LeBron lol. WNBA goes harder than the NBA
This year is not last year. She won't back down, and you will see MORE than Gunnerdown~Cunningham having the Fever teammates back 🤘
Not only did she poke CC in the eye watch closely she also grabbed her on her arms enough that CC’s arms were bright red wouldn’t surprise me if she not bruised
It’s wild you’d get arrested for assault for the exact same defenseless cheap shots but on a court it’s just cool.
If the referees did their job, this probably would have been prevented
Caitlin reminds me of Larry Bird.
wow they are really scripting this like WWE. Good girl bad girl trying to get more fans. Its so obvious
us Indy fans will cheer Sophie for years  everytime she hits the floor...you can bet on that...just like the are gonna boo marina marbry  every time
I’d be nice to see some big black women help out. Go Sophie!
@zito Bear Down!   Also, Sophie Cunningham was a kicker in high school!
eye poke deserves suspension.  And Fine. Automatic. League Rule. The player will make sure they don't do it again.
karate? Sophie's move looked more like pro wrestling, pulled her off the corner rope and face planted her...
People are calling for Sophie to be kicked out of wnba it was a hard foul but it wasn't as bad as what carrington did to caitlin with fake nails they shouldn't be allowed to wear and they call for her to be kicked out the referees let this game be physical and the fever got tired of getting hacked all night I would retaliated earlier
@8:41 CC you gotta square up and protect yourself a little here
LOVE IT
John Stockton and Karl Malone. ,   If anyone dirty fouled Stockton you could guarantee a Karl Malone 250lb elbow to their face ,, Even the announcers would say it ,,,
White woman are better at basketball
Heyyyyyyyy a female Bill Laimbeer! I love it!
It’s what mj and Kobe had you can’t teach it, works at her craft more than anybody.
Not only did Cunningham's jersey sell out, but her socials absolutely exploded. Everyone started following her.
@1:40 this is the other thing that makes Caitlyn different.  It’s not just the logo threes and the scoring record.  It’s her toughness and attitude.  She brings a different energy to the game and the fans LOVE it.
Ridiculous. Play the ball, and not the eyeball, not the head, not the shoulder, not the knees, not the ankles.
I have never seen a player get beat up in any league like CC has..
I’m ordering both jerseys!
@The Pat McAfee Show lets see how long the league makes new money if Clark gets hurt because the WNBA allows players getting hit in the back while not looking. in boxing you cant even do that and that's a combat sport in football you cant get away with that and the NBA  same deal so lets see if the WNBA will make money when she gets hurt for real lets see if they get new sponsorship new tv license lets see if they keep there charter flights that they only had for 2 years lets see if the league expands so ya let the referees keep doing what they are doing and last yes they have other Talent but never  with this star power the NBA NFL NHL  MLB all had talent and then someone came along and changed i could go on hell you did not even speak to nice about her. so for now if this league wants to allow bs then lets see how good they do because when she was out for just 5 days the WNBA ratting and everything went down to half and that's only 5 days lol  its not the referees fault its the person running the league
Sophie is for CC, what Charles Oakley was for MJ in his first years. Love it!!!
The CC experiment has been very revealing for the WNBA.  Can you say reverse :)
WNBA is headed for the trash bin. Englebert is 100% responsible for  moronic officiating and allowed thugery.  Their demise is 100% self inflicted.  I love it and im laughing.
Dude all I can say is get better....hating on someone because they are skilled is stupid they could do the same thing but don't apply themselves
Never thought I'd be interested in the WNBA but here I am.
I know Pat is happy he can talk about CC getting into a fight and not talk about race
Thanks Pat for defending Caitlin Clark.
Howard should have decked Mabry
Sophie is a BEAST! Love her tenacity and fight! Mabry is a punk
Racism and jealousy are an ugly combo, if CC was a black lesbian she'd be the queen of the WNBA
why F1 catching a stray at 5:47? That stuff is getting exciting
After Sophie Jerseys sales and popularity went up, I'm sure other teammates gonna start protecting CC more. 😂
Sophie clenching about give Sheldon a couple of knees on her face. Let's put them on the Octagon and see who' s the real tough nut
Had to hold back the laugh cuss the players are threatening to hold out 😂
Why is no one talking about Lexi hull standing up for Caitlin also.  She immediately got in Sheldon's face
'89 Pistons vibes.
It's wild how most people in media don't call this out for what it is: Clark is the wrong skin color and they're pissed. Everyone knows it. This pu$$y footing around it proves my point. Reverse roles and imagine the narratives and sh!t storm.
Get them Indiana Fever a Dennis Rodman type enforcer 😂 gotta protect your MJ 💯
Caitlin Clark is the real life Lagertha of the WNBA.
You want a beef, Sophie and the fever girls are going to bring the whole butcher shop.
Before CC no one was even following the WNBA . To go after her is just insane to me.
Look at the classless W men applauding the bad conduct.  Yes, all four had bad conduct.  Clark, Sheldon, Mabrey and Cunningham. Talking trash and fighting.  What are you men happy about.  It is called embarrassment.
need her teammates in there throwing bows, dont care who you are or what sport you play, need to protect the face of the league
I love it too! White girls dominate!
Somewhere Angel Reese is punching air
Its not a race thing with Caitlin Clark... Its jealousy of the straight woman.
NBA lost the league because they are all boys off the court.. best buddies. Hating eachother is critical to great sports
SOPHIE THE TROPHY !  She is big & hot af its awesome
Caitlin Clark would beat me in ball, I suck! Hahaha
In Sophie We Trust! So-Cunning be absolutely bossing it.
The great one had mcsorley
Cmon a black belt at the age of 6 people actually believe this
❤CC22🐐
I can’t take the bad language! Bye
WNBA a joke
Tell the league next time she won’t be that nice
Sophie is straight-up gangster. I love how she has CC's back. And being a gorgeous baller doesn't hurt either.
Caitlin Clark’s beautiful blonde teammate is making headlines? Let’s see how badly the WNBA can screw this up
Sometimes, you just have to release the dogs!
Notice Natasha Howard doing nothing when Mabrey knocked CC down.
Most of pats viewers never played an organized sport.
Pat, you're totally wrong  !! This isn't FN wrestling. This is basketball, it isn't hockey or football  !!! These jealous morons are being told to take her out. The fact that these half ass referees can't do their FN jobs says it all. If this was off the court these bitches would be arrested. So, if this league is going to allow it, then someone is going to be seriously hurt.
The sad thing is that only 1 of her teammates stood up for her. The rest did nothing. It seems that jealousy is also in the Fever's team
CC with a Lefugh you 3's HAHA
Literally, nobody cares besides the media
So why aren't people behind Stewart and Ionescu like they are behind CC? And they are way more accomplished in college and pro.
The WNBA is letting this happen to get the attention, and butts on seats, be under no illusion the WNBA will sacrifice Caitlin Clark to keep the focus!
CC is the 🐐🐐🐐
How is Clark not in the ad. Face off the league. They don’t want to succeed
Yes JC is from Ohio State. She's 0-12 against Caitlin, I think. She doesnt like Caitlin much!   Little side note! Sophie's jersey sold out minutes after the game last night!
Well, what are you gonna say if they do poker? I out and her career is over
Women fighting is corny. Where’s has the femininity gone 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
The dirty play has to go.  Refs need to do their damn jobs…CONSISTENTLY.
Finally a show on ESPN that's telling it like it is. Not some black female hating on CC and saying this has nothing to do with her being who she is. A white woman that's the star of the league.
Unbelievable, one small decision can completely changed someone. I'm 43yrs old. $73,000 biweekly and I'm retired, this video have inspired me greatly in many ways!!!!❤️
So yall ain’t see her throwing elbows lmaoo STOP IT CC is just as dirty
Wtf is this
Sophie is not just a pretty face she can throw hands
That muay Thai grip
It is a trash league. Unwatchable garbage.
WNBA needs to get control of this. I know they are happy because people are talking about the league, but someone(CC) is going to get hurt.
Basketball is not Hockey or the NFL. So, there should not be that much physicality in that sport, unless it is called a foul. Both Sheldon and Mabrey should have been ejected earlier and none of this would have happened. There is a difference between being physical and just all our DIRTY. Sheldon is a dirty player. Period. And if Mabrey cannot control her jealousy of Caitlin, maybe she should just ride the bench.
Don’t come to Detroit smackin those gums like that
These are the Jordan Rules gone wrong.
That's not taking up for her. That's just thug ball. I often forgot this is still cracker tv
Sophie Laimbeer   Mo Lucas Cunningham !
Maybe CC can teach Reese how to do a layup.
Caitlin Clark should protect herself and her career by leaving the WNBA
We WANT sofie on SPORTS ILLUSTRATED!!!
Refs are dumb as shite. The fact that it was a no call involving Clark...the biggest name in the WNBA says the league will turn a "blind" eye again. We need a Kevin Costner voice over eye poke, "Back and to the left," SLOWED "Back and to the left." "Back and to the left."
When the WNBA shows more physicality than the NBA.  😂😂😂😂😂
Sophie is awesome 🤩
Thank you, Sophie for backing up your message about anyone messing with Caitlin Clark! Jerky Sheldon was on a mission from the beginning to try and hurt CC after she just got back from a quad injury! Just plain jealous trash players! Then Mabry comes behind like a bat out of hell and pushes Clark on the floor. What the hell is going on? ? Are the WNBA referees blind ? Fever will be the new WNBA champions for 2025! Suck it up!
Wtf I love WNBA now..
Sophie doesn't just talk about it. SHE IS ABOUT IT. apart from Aliyah Boston, where is the cavalry?
Sophie is Jacy mother
Man I love your show pat
this is the making of the WNBA
This is better than the movies
Does nobody see what's going on they are trying to purposely give caitlin clark a career ending injury, these last 2 years the blatant fouls committed on clark it's obvious and just saying those refs needs to b investigated inside out,finances,and ect,and a polygraph test,those refs and wnba needs to b investigated because clark is going to get hurt,it's not when it's how bad please do something
Guys only watch golf to take naps on the weekend 🥱 😴 💤
Whole team needs to be traded besides Sophie and Caitlin
The Connecticut Suns are thug players
Racism and the CC bounty in the WNBA is wild.  CC needs to go to Europe and inspire young girls around the world to be great players.  The WNBA doesn’t deserve her!
its okay to atttack cc - Stephen a, mcnutt, esquire
Sophie is a dawg.  Love her.  ❤️
CC!!
First the clinch, next comes the elbows and knees 😁
Where was her other teammates when she first got fouled ???
Dirtbag Pistons? I cant stand this guy!!!
Who cares????❤
Question: next season or two, when the next Caitlin Clark comes to the WNBA, rookie season, but she isn’t white, same energy for her rookie season???
She got Jordan treatment 😮
I am to the point I'd love to see CC leave the WNBA and go to another league be it overseas or that 3 on 3 team she turned down and watch the revenue for the wnba drop.  Those girls who continue to assault her shouldn't benefit from the fans CC brings.  There is a difference between hard fouls and assault and getting stabbed in the eye is assault.
The bully got destroyed 😀😜👍
These guys don’t watch the games and have no idea about how rotten teams have been to her. I hope at the end of the year CC retires and plays overseas and then we’ll see what that cba is worth.
And now idiots want Sophie banned because "what she did isn't basketball." 🙄
Caitlin is a man
The rest of Caitlins teammates need to step up like Sophie did. I used to be a big NBA fan but can't stand the game now. Nothing but 3 pointers, constant traveling that never gets called. And no defense. Love watching Caitlin and the fever. The rest of the league could care less.whoever the wnba commissioner is better step up.
I've never seen a defenseless player blindsided like that in any sport, (or even in a pick-up game) and the cheap shot player remain in the game.  At a certain point you have to worry about someone having a depraved indifference to another player's humanity.  Hockey and Football have codes about that.  The WNBA seems to not only have no unwritten code between the players, but it also lacks referees who make intelligent decisions based on clear facts and video.  I honestly don't care who the players involved are, although there does seem to be a bullying issue going on against Clark, since this has happened to her multiple times.  You cannot cheap shot someone blindly like that, and stay in the game.  Should've been an automatic ejection for Mabrey, without question.   And its a shame, because I really liked Mabrey.  I was a Sun fan because of her and Tina Charles, but I definitely lost a lot of respect for her after that punk move.
The usual suspects. Dont let people with high testosterone play womens sports
I am all for hard foul and making a person earn a basket BUT the constant eye pokes is bullsh*t.
The Connecticut COWS. LOSERS/Cellar Dwellers!
The Fever need to trade for a big that will protect her night in & night out
Indiana Fever gots Stories. It's the Beginning WNBA History "NO I IN TEAM"  DRAKE - 0 to 100/ The Catch Up
Mabry is a hottie 😂😂😂
It's about time. Sophie Cunningham, WE'RE SO PROUD OF YOU. It's not an individual sport. It's a team sport, and if they keep picking on Caitlin then here teammates  should be the big sister & Protect your ,Sister do dirty work because they've been playing dirty on Caitlin all the time and the refs are a piece of s***..... Cunningham WW WNBA lol Al the way   ❤
I want to see Sophie in WWE…
Unfortunately, the black women on the Fever team refuse to get involved when CC is attacked. It will be up to Sophie and Lexie to protect Caitlin Clark.
WNBA refs are just not the best.(understatement)
Cunningham's foul should not have bene a flagrant 2, that was laziness by the refs.. it should have been a regular or take foul with a follow up technical and ejection for fighting (in the W and NBA on fights all parties are ejected by rule)/ But saying its a F2 made it easier to explain. If you watch the original play slowly she puts her hands up then Sheldon throws her left shoulder into Cunningham's chest, putting herself off balance, causing Cunningham's to reach over "take" foul look even harder than it was - at the most its a Flagrant 1.
I love it.  It's about time they get some enforcers for CC.  You hit our best player we hit your best player
I looked back at the original Eye poke early in the game and I still cannot figure out HOW the H E double L they justified giving Clark a technical - for getting fouled, being slightly disoriented, and then having Sheldon try to chest bump and intimidate (along with Charles) her only to be knocked down by Mabry. They should rescind that technical foul its just not right.
The reason you like WNBA is because it like watching WWE. That is why I can not stand the WNBA. I like physical game but the WNBA is why to dirty plays
These Referees are ....(censored)  Caitlin "THE ASSASSIN" and Sophie "THE ENFORCER"  I love it  In Europe, Refs like this would NEVER, NEVER EVER direct a game.
WNBA is getting very interesting..a  Must Watch 😂..I’m definitely buying a Sophie Cunningham jersey
WNBA needs real refs
caitlin clark and pat are dawgsss ❤! up the fever
that hockey jersey is fire
Imagine if the NBA did to Bird what the WNBA is doing to Caitlin. The NBA would have gone under.
That White 💪
Sorry guys, its all about race, black bitches think they own the game, when a Super talent white girls shows up and beat that ass ,they can't stand it ,wnba got their egenda too ,outrage and anger sell tickets, the refs are instructed not to  make calls or turn a blind eye for opponents of the newest elite player s,but that can't last before outrage turns into lost ticket sales and tv revenue loss because they are rigging game play !!!!!
finally, someone stands up for racism
It's sad that the beautiful ones have to lower themselves to the violent level of the roaches just to survive. CC should abandon the Fatigue League.
Sis Sophie showing these kids not to mess with her teamates. That's awesome.
"dirt bag Pistons"?  Before Jordon was relevent it was the Detroit Pistons who needed enforcers like Mahorn and Lambeer to protect Isiah Thomas
"Havin good cheap shots not good." Well said. I good not agree incompletely.
Pat McGhee I need you on these medications. For your next WWE match with Goldberg for the title. Lol  Pure herion  Emma Weed  Smack  Acid  Goofy man. Lol Raja Mozeni
Sophie was a dog at Mizzou. So she is a similar breed to the Iowa in Caitlin. Sophie didn’t lead her team to final fours at Mizzou but wasn’t far from it
I'll be waiting outside the sun stadium for number 3
Marina Mabrey is a punk. Taking cheap shots and then walking towards the bench. If she wants to scrap, stay in there and go. Don't hit and run.
It’s not trashy to the people trying to say that “just bc their women” this is regular business in the NBA and fans love it! Cc and Sophie standing up and start showing the toughness is even funner to watch, look at how CC hypes the crowd….we see that all the time in the NBA. It is a competitive sport, we want passion and they are bringing it! Go WNBA and CC and SC and all players bringing the drama… keep growing the fanbase!!!
Caitlin’s team should play as rough as ever other team, see how they like that
Let’s not forget that Sheldon is also responsible for Sophie’s chipped tooth & sprained ankle.  Think a lot of fever fans wanted to fight Sheldon for playing so aggressive the whole game.
Caitlin needs to learn some self-defense moves. You gotta let them have it CC.
Sophie Cunningham is sexy AF also
You like the Suns doing what they did? You absolutely suck, Pat.
FYI sophie can actually literally fight.
I fkn LOVE Sophie. Build a statue man. The other Fever teammates need to step up and stand up for their own.
Lexi and Sophie were the only two Fever players to have CCs back. Says a lot.
Marion Mabrey?  Dude, learn their names.
Finally an enforcer, protector, a bad girl with a blackbelt able to go blow for blow with these goons trying to clip the golden goose. I like it, I'm a Sophie Cunningham fan now. The rest of the team needs to find their cohones and stay ready to clap back, don't let the others teams do that and get away with it, start swinging on these girls and earn some respect, get mean!
This is not a good look for women's sports
Can we get James Johnson to identify as a female and get him on the Fever roster? This is getting ridiculous.
If the players in the WNBA go on strike, they can just bring in replacement players. No one will know the difference 😂
The eye pokes are attempting to seriously injure her
Sophie for DAWG of the year.
Pat McAfee, let's call this like it really is,  wnba wants to dis hearten Caitlin clark by bad refs, bad calls, probably telling suns to hit clark, everything is to stop Caitlin clark from playing,  from receiving sponsors that the wnba and players believe is theirs.    It's a coordinated attack against clark to stop her play period...
WNBA executives are the absolute dumbest bunch.  Gotta be all ex-players
Caitlin Clark has done more for the WNBA than any other person before her.
WNBA refs are a disgrace!!
I don't mind them being physical, but these refs need to call the fouls. they are letting to many arm grabs and jersey pulls go on CC. The eye poking and cheap shots need to be stopped big time. That little JC (jealous c*^$%) tried it twice last night. She'd have 10 more points a game if the didn't allow them to bully her like that.
Micheal jordan was oakley my guy...😑😑😑.
How would Coach Hawk (girls basketball coach veteran. Pretty sure they were champs or close to it!) handle coaching Caitlin? 4 enforcers with her at all times?
Please sir, dont hype up OKC again just like game 4.. why u chants pacers is underdog by mile and disrespect okc and hype them up.. pacers did good until you chants that.. you just hype them up. Please dont do that again, please
Some of the other team members were in it last night. Lexi Hull was right into it on the first dust up.
Sophie was pretty much the only one to have CC's back (although Lexi got on Jayce before Maybrey flattened CC behind Lexi's back) at least to the biggest (and most needed) extent. The rest of the team was MIA, pathetically! Maybe it was a "white girl thing?" LOL
Maybe Andrew Nembhard should take some notes on the eye-gouge technique for defending SGA?
SHES HER
You don't mind a little Antiwhiteism do ya Pat.
Nobody can pump up the crowd like Caitlin.
When ur best player gets touched, someone catching a fine. And the team better pay 4 it
Sophie's jersey sold out after the game.
Ummmm...I had to pause this video at the immediate moment.... are we talkin about a holdout??? If the WNBA is so against the whiteness of Cailin Clark, that they would LITERALLY SABOTAGE the ENTIRE LEAGUE, to holdout for what? The WNBA has operated, within the ENTIRETY of its existence, outside of this season, at a deficit. 12 teams operate at an average of -$12 million/season. What are you holding out for? The effort in futility would be catastrophic!
the boys can’t stop naming other sports to watch besides the WNBA 😆
Suns are bunch of sore losers
Sophie is a gangsta for talking to Sheldon and her teammate while she was manhandling them both!!! 😀😂🤣
So she’s a black belt eh?! That’s is very cool!! And sexy ❤️
Love it🎉🤘🏾👏🏽
The WNBA needs to address the angry lesbians and thug life hooches before the fans and sponsors say piece out
Pokes her in the eye, chest bumps her and then acts upset when Clark barely pushes her away.
Pat what a shame , why do we have referees in these game,  that a player needs to standup for  the next player?  Referees need to get a handle on the match, the match needs to be safe space for all and players/teams have to play the next one two days to come.   That’s what you should be speaking about. You guys continue to focus on the noise and not the issues.  Can’t represent behind the mic get out, it’s not to sell you personal thoughts when the facts in before you.
Pivotal time is right.. all you need is a CC season-ending injury that'll drop viewership by 80% and the players will have no leverage in negotiations.
Refs still SUCK!
CC talks enough 💩 she needs to stand up for herself…
If I'm the Fever i just get 4 or 5 more that want to mix it up and go full "Bad Boys" Pistons type sh... Just out physical everyone else.
wnba should be completely ashamed. disgraceful
Boston as big as she is she must be soft AF.  She never wants any smoke
5:23 I think it's crazy that Sabrina lonescu can I have 30 point games and it's no big deal, but when Caitlin Clark has a 30-point game they want to drug test her. The WNBA is literally doing everything possible to shoot themselves in the foot and Destroy what day have going on right now just because they're a bunch of biased assholes. And Kathy Engelberg seriously needs to step down as commissioner because she obviously does not take her job seriously. And instead of high school referees, they need to bring in professional referees that will actually call the games the right way
CC is the WNBA
I was at this game with my daughter. The crowd was ELECTRIC! It was something special for sure. Obviously the refs have been terrible for both sides, glad no one was hurt, but it led to a memorable night.
Honestly, (*Kevin Owens hands up meme*) this puts more eyes on the product!
The fever definitely needs a Semenko
If Caitlin gets seriously injured they will never get the cba they claim they deserve. Sales and viewership will tank.
When someone delivers a career ending cheap shot on Ms. Clark, it will be a societal and cultural problem.  All of the stereotypes will be in front of 300 million Americans, not just the few people who watch WNBA sleep fests.
Wow, how bold of Pat to barely have an opinion on what is blatant league-wide abuse that the refs continue to tolerate and the league hasn't begun to fine players for obvious targeting.
hand in the face defense needs to be banned its bitchmade bull
Goons protecting Wayne. 😮😮
Sophie the Trophy 🏆😍
when three players hit you top shooter and you dont do anything besides one player you aint a team
WNBA more physical than NBA 😂
ESPN be like Breaking News: Caitlyn Clark got fouled 😂😂
CC is once in a lifetime. She’s going to have the biggest impact since Jordan. She transcends ball
This isn't news.
+500: Indicated by FanDuel as of June 16, 2025.
Sophie isnt an enforcer she know who to try that with. Noone cares about a black belt at 6t she never used in real life. She didnt try it with Marina or KiKi in preseason
WNBA is doing everything they can to keep Clark tied down.  They probably have extreme anxiety about the prospects of making too much revenue and losing their NBA welfare check every season.
Proud of Sophie for standing up and showing Fever is over the obvious BS from other players.
Actually it started with Caitlin in the 2nd qtr throwing a cheap shot that didn’t get called. If you strut around acting all aggressive and tough why are you surprised when you get aggressive treatment back. Bird knew he was going to get the treatment when he ran his mouth. Difference was he didn’t run all over the court trying to punk the refs or other teams. He did it more on the down low. But hey, to each their own. Just don’t cry when you give it out you’re going to have to take some back.   We will see if Cunningham will step up if it’s someone that isn’t half her size. I don’t know that she won’t but throwing down Sheldon & tying her up isn’t any Boss move. Mabrey was the one who knocked Clark down, why not see if you can throw her down ?   Either call the initial unnecessary contact or let them get to swinging ( which none of them really want to do anyway) Guaranteed if it was like the old days and a couple of teeth got knocked out or a few black eyes they’d all calm down their fake tough guy act. Not wanting it to happen but they all want to wolf because they know they’ll never have to suffer any significant consequences. They want to act like the guys now. Always about to do something but mostly just want to act tough and wait for everyone to get between them while they talk as they walk away
Please god start printing Bad Ladies shirts.  As a representative of the city of Detroit and the Deeeeeeeetrrrrrrrrroooooooitttttttt BASKETBALLLLL Pistons, I approve.
Glthe reffing has been Sus af all season...
This is the second time she's been intentionally eye poked. When will the wnba act?  After she suffers a career ending injury?  Is that what they want,    To commit organizational suicide?
its not proffesional basket ball ...pro thug ball !!!
So, let's get this straight. Clark's teammate stood up for Clark, and that's OK. But last year  when Carter stood up for her teammate. She was crucified. Hypocrites, nothing but plain old Hypocrites.
"She's not a rookie, Caitlin has won" , really, won what?
Weird how the WNBA allows their golden goose to get beat up.
SOPHIE 💪🏻🥰
Sophie did the right thing Indiana loves her . Much respect 🫡 💛💙💛💙
WNBA can’t even handle the emotion around CC.  Players aren’t taking advantage of the new eyes watching because CC. I am watching a video on the WNBA only because of CC.  I truly never thought that would happen.   If CC is gone they have nothing.  Wake up WNBA.
Caitlyn Clark Kent… the W will eventually learn
Dirtbag Detroit Pistons?
Cunningham is the youngest black belt in Missouri history. She got it at 6 years old
I support WNBA clips
the big girl thats leaving for europe should do the team a few solids and start making some dirty players pay
My favorite part is when Sophie grabbed the back of her head and was just jawin her. 😂
"Sophie the trophy" making enforcing look good
The suns are dirty players physical play is good but cheap shots are dirty   very class less. This fever team is gonna be a dynasty
I would love to see her do some karate kicks on these scissor queens
Black racist wnba players need suspensions
WNBA has been like this
I agree with most people's comments about the officiating.  It was terrible!  Maher should have been ejected, and since she wasn't, Sophie shouldn't have been either.  A few things will likely draw the ire of readers who come across this comment. CC shouldn't have been taunting the Sun's bench and running around instead of going to her bench after she made the 3-pointer, which gave the Fever a 20-point lead with 3:48 left in the game. It's a good thing that Coach White benched her after that, because CC put herself a bigger target than she already had.  Not very smart because the Sun had nothing to lose at this point. Coach White in the post-game presser said that she would be the one answering questions about the officiating, as a reporter had asked CC an officiating question. CC has received a few technical fouls, and she got one last night. I wouldn't be surprised if Coach White will be giving a directive that she will be the one who argues with referees for bad calls.
JUST SO YOU KNOW, LEXIE ALSO WENT AND GOT IN SHELDON'S FACE, WITH A FEW CHOICE WORDS, LETTING HER KNOW. DON'T DO THAT AGAIN. GREAT JOB LEXIE, AND SOFIE,  HAVING YOUR GIRLS BACK. ❤😊
Double standard narrative   A hero? A enforcer? This woman can wear half naked crazy pregame outfits Sleep with a PHX Suns staff member who was married Now sophie can  chases down and blatantly lay down a player when the fever were up 10+ Black women would be called hateful, angry, and thugs If Reese did what Sophie has done she would be called a home wrecker and a dirty player
It will be the Trifecta of sports. Pacers, Fever, Colts all win championships this year.
Sophie is Bae ❤❤❤
Melee?
When they cheap shot Caitlin Clark, they woke the sleeping giant, poked the bear, grabbed the tiger by the tail, played with fire, opened Pandora's box, bit off more than they could chew, brought a knife to a gunfight, said hello to Tony Montana's little friend, walked into the lion's den, shot themself in the foot, stole John Wick's car and killed his dog, got caught in their own web, let the fox in the henhouse, built castles out of sand, ran with scissors, jumped out of the frying pan into the fire, hit rock bottom, fell victim to the Dunning-Kruger Effect, dug their own graves, stepped on Elvis's blue suede shoes, was made an offer they can’t refuse from Don Corleone, missed the boat, got caught with their pants down, got a knock on their door from 60 Minutes or heard a voice behind them say, “Hi, I’m Chris Hansen, from Crime Watch Daily”, lit the fuse, , drank the Kool-aid, unleashed the Kraken, drove off a cliff, wrote a check they could not cash, crossed the Rubicon, told Tommy Devito to go home and get his shinebox, leaped before looking, were led by the Pied Piper, bought the Brooklyn Bridge, painted themself into a corner, killed the goose that laid the golden eggs, went down with the ship, signed their own death warrant, called Marty McFly a chicken, rocked the boat, ran into an immovable object, got their just deserts, stepped on a crack, pissed off Bruce Banner, entered the echo chamber, went off the rails on a crazy train, hung themselves with their own rope, did not stay in their lane and know their role, assassinated Archduke Ferdinand, buried their head in the sand, ate the forbidden fruit, told Fonzie he was wrong, jumped the shark, robbed Peter to pay Paul, had a plan but got punched in the mouth by Mike Tyson, triggered karma and Murphy’s Law upon themselves, falsely accused the Count of Monte Cristo of treason, captained the Exxon Valdez, touched a nerve, messed with the wife of a jealous man, checked into the Hotel California, counted their chickens before they hatched, put their foot in their mouth, ran into a brick wall, let the dogs out, bombed Pearl Harbor, broke a mirror, walked under a ladder, crossed paths with a black cat, smoked in bed, dug their own grave, barked up the wrong tree, snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, did not look both ways before crossing the street, got involved with Amway, looked a gift horse in the mouth, checked into the roach motel, stirred up a hornet's nest, swallowed the poison pill, fell asleep on the beach on a sunny day, called the kettle black, was struck by lightning, bit the hand that feeds them, bent over to pick up a bar of soap in a men's prison shower, brought cannabis to Russia in luggage, screwed the pooch, made it completely FUGAZI and FUBAR, went on a fool’s errand, licked a frozen pole, put themselves in harm’s way, judged a book by its cover, was blinded by the light, put all their eggs in one basket, took the blue pill, effed around and found out, cried over spilt milk, got a taste of their own medicine, gave up their day job, went on a wild goose chase, lit a cigarette at a gas station, kicked against the goads, played in traffic, ran with the bulls, stepped on a rake, texted while drinking and driving, tempted fate, pissed in their own pool, threw caution to the wind, painted a bullseye on their back, slipped on a banana peel, built a house of cards, dropped the ball, stirred the pot, crossed wires, slept with the fishes, danced with the devil, did not keep Will Smith’s wife’s name out of their mouth, answered an email from a Nigerian prince, tripped over a land mine, became a fly in the ointment, a monkey in the wrench and a pain in the ass, went down in flames, fell from grace, took a long walk on a short pier, got their comeuppance, plowed another man’s field, threw good money after bad, faced the music, fell into quicksand, burned their bridges, went to a Diddy freak off party, farted in a crowded elevator, did not play with a full deck, forgot to delete their search history, sowed the wind and reaped the whirlwind, accepted a Trojan Horse gift, went up the creek without a paddle, had their goose cooked, played Russian Roulette with a fully loaded gun, fell asleep at the wheel, got hoisted on their own petard, fired shots in a circular firing squad, doused fire with gasoline, cut off their nose to spite their face, fell on their sword, pooped their pants, crapped the bed, threw stones in a glass house, told Clint Eastwood they feel lucky, invested with Bernie Madoff or in Enron stock, boarded the Titanic, tugged on Superman's cape, spit into the wind, pulled the mask off the old Lone Ranger and messed around with Jim.
Cunningham had that muay thai clinch on her 😂
Mandy should be out six games
When I saw what Sophie did, not intending to injure, but if not to defend CC, to let her know she wasn't going to be run over as Jayce kept banging hard into her... I actually felt better! Why? Because I want the nonsense to stop! I wrestled, was a 4 year letterman in college Division 1. I tried to keep the rules, but use everything within the rules. When someone else started outside the rules, like slapping my headgear super hard (intentionally breaking the rules to try to get an advantage) and the ref called nothing? That meant the rules were different. The next time he hit me, I flagrantly hit him just as hard and as much, if not more so. It forced the ref to blow the whistle, talk to both of us, and then we were back to real wrestling. It let him know I would have none of it! I refused to give them an unfair advantage because of the ref not doing his job, and soon both quickly knew it by my actions. It always worked!
The Fever has a ton of leverage on this league. They can threaten the league with a lawsuit and they should and they would get a TON of support from the fans and that means a huge hit to the bottom line if they don't do something about this. It is so crazy obvious they are out to hurt CC. It is insanity
Talking about any one else outside of CC and the fever is dumb AF, I hate Pat trying to be inclusive. There’s literally one singular reason the WNBA has ANY momentum whatsoever, it’s CC.
The WNBA is developing a very marketable product, much like the NBA in the 80's with the Bird vs Magic rivalry.  But, horrible officiating that allows thug players to demolish Clark will result in casual  viewers leaving and no longer watching. WNBA needs to get their act together and call the games straight and fair to let these new stars flourish.
There is one certainty in Indy, Sophie will not have to pay for a drink as long as she plays for the Fever!  Hell, I live in Florida and if I saw her, I'd buy her a drink!  By the way I'm a70 year old man! (I can dream, right?)
Howard just stood there when CC was assaulted.  Howard always seemed jealous of CC
The blk Indiana teammates are doing enough to defend CC.. They’ll always stick together when it comes to the yts. They’re inherently animalistic.
I have no problem with what Sophie did standing up for her teammate. The problem I have is with coach White. She should have gone full Bobby Knight on the refs for not ejecting mabry for blindsiding Clark.
Caitlin Curry Clark!!!! Triple C. The refs really have to protect her alil better. She is the reason why we watch the W. Respectfully. Golden Goose needs to be protected!!!!
Pat agree
Sophie is a star too. Now shes blowing up. But she was a killer before. Lol she just ain't afraid to go for it.
Sophie Cunningham,  Amazing
The WNBA is allowing this because watching women beat the crap out of themselves is more entertaining than watching them play basketball.
If you go back and watch Lexie is stepping up more and pushing back, along with all around good play.
How the f*** Is CC not the main person on that poster to show they are going to the Cup final game?
Prettiest badass in the league!!!
I think the WNBA is turning into what basketball is supposed to be played!! It's not at the level obviously, but it does remind me of 80's 90's NBA. TURE basketball game... JS
At least the white girl will protect her teammate
WNBA just mad she's straight
Sophie is fine af. Happy we got her!
Damn can’t even have Caitlin Clark on the banner for the commissioners cup
Get her on the show. Sophie
The way Sophie grabbed the back of ole girls head I was waiting for knees
I’m gonna have to start watching!
OMG it's WNBA. What a JOKE. Move on. Fail
I never thought I would get fired up watching the WNBA. I love that Kaitlyn Clark has fire and doesn't get rattled when basically every player in the league fucks with her,takes cheap shots etc, because they aren't good..  It's so funny seeing her game compared to other WNBA "stars" like Angel Reese,who WNBA execs should have assassinated w/how much her "play" makes the league look like a joke. And Lonescu,who is always praised as this amazing player......got shut down by a THIRTEEN year old boy in the Philippines when the WNBA visited  Seriously, a KID who isn't even playing high school basketball....IF they even offer that as a sport in the Philippines,....this THIRTEEN year old boy who lives somewhere I doubt many people play ball , was all over her and D'ed her up to the point of frustration and she started swinging elbows at a child!  THIS is one of the best that league that will NEVER be financially viable or successful. And the one player who could help bail out your sinking ship , can't because all the other sailors keep trying to throw her overboard.....and that joke of a league will find a way to blame misogyny!
The eye poke that’s really dirty ass play !! That’s could be career ending right there , poor wnba should be fine tons of money for let mediocre player poking eye !! And the mediocre player that just knock CC down hard on the floor  CC was cover her eye defenseless could see it coming and that ass mediocre player knock her down that one should be terminate out of the league soon or this league will be see in the court ! As continue to let done mediocre player to tackle like football in the basketball court , enough is enough, get this league out soon !!👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
sheldons always been a dirty player she hurt two fever players last game they played before the eye poke this game
If you look up FAFO online, Sophie's video of opening a can of whup Ass on Sheldon should start playing.👊👊
Y don't U ST£U mouth
The only reason ANYONE even watched this is Clark😮 not Pat
Johnson 2:34 🤣 Love that man! He wears a grill.. top and bottom, on the court! Rick starts getting hot and you see Johnson just step in between him and the refs.. it shuts down quick!
Three stooges of the WNBA. 😂
As an old head, I enjoy physical plays in every sport. We've gotten soft. However, blatantly targeting players in the open court or field should be immediately handled with. I love Marina Mabrey, but that should've been a flagrant 2 with how the tensions were going. It should've never gotten to the point where Sophie had to handle business.
Its crazy when people say CC doesn't get abused more hhan other players.  Last year, she received 1/3rd of all flagrant fouls in the league. Not just regular fouls, but fouls that go beyond basketball.
Sophie is going to do that for her teammates
Not the first time Soph enforced, she's doing it all year.
Omg I'm in love with Sophie!! 😔
Barbie brawl
And that's the biggest issue right there the black women on the team is not doing anything because they care more about black women backlash, they're not going to stand up for kicking and Clark if they try to defend Caitlin Clark all the angry ghetto black going to be race bathing victimhood dating, I'm calling the black football player sellouts, that's one of the main reason why they want the fan Caitlin Clark and they supposedly be teammates, and they always saying they do this in the men's team one thing about the NBA the men's defends the other teammates even if they don't like that's what makes women basketball sucks it's all about feelings if the whole team was protecting Caitlin Clark no team would dare try to touch her 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
They keep eye gouging her. That's not a foul, it's assault
Can’t get ratings by skill so trying to get them by turning it into female hockey scraps and nascar crashes.
Sophia got legs and that grit !!!
The refs are just letting it go when CC is the target.  Even yesterday when it was so egregious they had to do something, they didn't eject Mabrey and even gave CC a technical when she was the blameless victim of a gouge and bump from Sheldon and then a blindside body-slam from Mabrey.  The league is supposedly looking at the incidents and may upgrade and levy fines for some of the actions.  Cunningham will probably get fined for her "enforcing" role, but we'll see if they also punish CC for doing nothing untoward.
Sophie ..Caitlin  are White beauties in a Ghetto league..😂😂
The WNBA is turning into what the NBA used to be: _"GOOD"_ p.s. I'm half-kidding. This year's finals is actually enjoyable
Crazy CC tried to walk away twice and got assaulted
I'm a Fever fan.  And I appreciate what Sophie did.   But damn, she became a national hero overnight.
No one cares about the wbna
I love how after Sophie took down Sheldon, she stood there so calmly waiting for her to come at her and was completely ready and read her the riot act.  Sophie is both beauty and beast!
It explains a lot that Sheldon played at OSU.
Yeah we watch the wnba for the girl who was in a Russian prison
Rodman had MJ’s back and got 8 million rebounds also
Boston was right there when CC got blindsided and didn’t even say or do anything!
Sophie I’ll Kick Your Ass Cunningham. Love this add to the Fever.
Sophie is not a goon though, she's just really tough player that sticks up for her teammates. I didn't know that she has a martial arts background either, so the clinch made sense. Based on that, she could probably step to anyone in the league.
CC is now my favorite professional basketball player, not women's basketball player, just favorite all-around basketball player
I really appreciate your comments.  My son and daughter (both 12 and 13 respectively check your blog.  What we don't appreciate is your use of the f---k words.  Little kids do not need to hear your  cheap words.    You obviously have a very limited vocabulary.
Sophie a black belt
Fffff wat en mongool is dit 😮
The discourse on this shows who didn’t watch the game lol. CC pushes off all the time to get space in the 2nd, wasn’t get the foul call/separation she wanted and pushed Sheldon first. Then Sheldon grabbed her. Then we get to the incident, hard defense on Sheldon, clear foul that was called with the swipe to the face, after CC push offs mind you, then she retaliates by hitting Sheldon. Sheldon’s teammates Charles and Maybry stick up for Sheldon and say you’re not gonna push our team around. And Clark flops to the ground too embellishing what happened   I mean it’s just basketball on both ends, hard fouls and the players policing themselves. This does not become a huge story if Caitlin Clark isn’t involved
Wayne Gretzky had enforcers like Marty McSorley. Michael Jordan had Dennis Rodman to fight for him. Sophie and Aliyah Boston will step in to protect Caitlin.
WNBA is trying to bring back the "Jordan Rules" with Caitlin Clark. It isn't going to work. She will make them pay. You don't piss off someone of that level of talent and think it will get into her head and shut her down. In fact, the opposite will happen. She is the GOAT.
Sophia played football in highschool too
I knew you wouldn't play it straight. Thanks for all the laughs but I'm done
Hard personal fouls need to be called, legitimate physical play is recognized as professional grade. The eye gouging and blind side attacks are BS,  if you do that, ejection, suspension and stiff fine....Clean up the act league wide and make everybody happy, don't clean it up and there will be no audience for anything but the Fever. Nobody wants to watch cat fights and blatant personal fouls that aren't called, that's trash, that's thug street crap. Be professional and stop the BS...
Sophie Cunningham is a freaking beast!!!
Sophie was laying the groundwork at the 6 minute mark of the 4th quarter. She was already in Jacy's face. I think Sophie was letting her know what was coming. That was beautiful work and I would pay money to know what Sophie was whispering in Jacy's ear.
Caitlin is the ONLY reason I watch the WNBA.
CC get body checked forever dozens of slaps to the face off ball then gouge to right eye while dribbling in her left hand no where near the ball body checked again while blinded then gets a blindsided hit to the head and tripped slamming into the floor  Refs….? Give CC a technical foul. For what Oh for getting assaulted
CC 🔥
Angry, jealous, ghetto lesbians.
2:40 i'm sorry to inform but this is no longer what that word represents... 😂😂😂😂
She ain’t winning nothing and hasn’t won anything
Unless your last name is Gracie from Brazil and you have jujitsu champion pedigree, there’s very little defence against the hair pull technique. It’s a street fighting technique frowned upon in any self defence discipline but under the circumstances that Sophie employed it and given the behaviour of the player she employed it against, I support it. It’s pretty simple:extend your hand past your opponent’s shoulder, grab a fistful of hair firmly and yank down and back using the natural force of your weight. Sophie could have hurt her by the force and speed with which she pulled but did not want to hurt her too much.
WNBA officials, haters and jealous bags doesn't care what happens to CC they want her gone‼️So anyone who comes to her aid will be in their crosshairs too.😡
Best looking “goon” ever. Cunningham can play though.
Notice the difference in the team though. CC gets pinballed, hit, pushed then dropped to the ground in a blind cheap shot. Her team mates do nothing right then. Cunningham knocks down Sheldon her team mates immediately go for Cunningham. CC's teammates do not have her back at all. Waiting until there are 40 seconds left in the game to do something is not what I would call having CC's back.
Sophie Cunningham just had "Laimbeer-Mahorn" sewed on the back of her jersey now. She is the #1 Enforcer in the league. She is one BAD MAAMAA JAMA
Let get cc some goggles...she needs her eyes... jealousy is a mfer
If the refs are not doing their job, then Sophie "THE ENFORCER" has to do it. Sophie kicked Sheldons A$$ !! and rightly so. That little Brat Sheldon was asking for it the whole game. The refs were not calling sh*t because corrupt Englebert was paying Refs not to call fouls against CC !!!
Think Fever play Minnesota july 1st??
The way pat laughed at the fact that the wnba wanted to do a holdout for more money lol. Who would even notice that league isn’t playing anymore?
How about disallowing the long fingernails?
We need Sophie on the show
Caitlin's only rival is Sabrina.
I'd rather watch a clean game with C.C. hitting from half court than cat fights.
No idea who number 3 is, but knocking down Clark is probably her only way to get on ESPN and she's taking it.
Fine #3 her game salary for the belly bump…
Are goons allowed to be that beautiful?
They should let them fight like NHL and get that viewer ship up.
Sophie's hard play happens at the end of the game and I love the fact someone did something but to ALL the other Fever players...the foul and knock down of CC happened in the last 5 minutes of the 3rd...Mabry should've been laying on the floor 2 seconds later !!!
Dude kick rocks your fine when iit white on white crime , but it that was Reese and not  mabrey  the world would be acting different ......Just how CC was able to knock the hell out of Reese, the cry was not about Ref's need to do their jobs it was about oooooo Reese is faking ...
Was CC initially fouled? Yes. Everything she did after that was just straight flopping. That's why everyone that competes against her sees her as soft AF. They bumped into her and threw their hands up ASAP like "yo I barely touched her and she's on the ground like it was a double leg take down". Like BFF here.
A couple of those dudes on the other team are pretty big.
If you have to play dirty and still get blown out, you need a new career.
It's the best scam EVER! If you point out the OBVIOUS issues, YOU are the problem!
What you missed: Sheldon was the reason Colson was hurt and Sophie reinjured her ankle the last time CT was there and missed three games...
Sophie The Gorgeous Goon
That’s not a rivalry that’s a target it happens when you got no answer for an opponent you go cheap
Sophie has bigger marbles than most men
how many smoke shows are in the WNBA ? why not highlight them over those terrible players that are moaning bout pay
Mabry is friends with Bonner’s wife…Mabry hates Caitlin…Bonner’s wife talked all kinds of crap about Caitlin and Fever fans last year…Bonner is thought to be tanking it playing for the Fever…you tell me what’s up…
17% of flagrant fouls called last year were committed on CC.
Sophie Cunningham for president
its crazy how players in the WNBA just bully CC left and right lol.. but the WNBA does nothing about it lol.. .and until now i havent even seen CC's teammates stand up for her. bravo Sophie!
I like the physical play but the eye gouges are too much and the fouls need to be handed out equally and without bias.
Conn is dirty
Pat you should Sophie fine
The constant attacks on Caitlin Clark are bringing the wrong sort of attention to the league. For a league trying to fight for legitimacy the systemic assaults on its most popular player only show it doesn't deserve what it wants
Fire the refs
I don't like to see this junk!!  I want to watch basketball.  I think about the young kids watching. Wondering if the officials are going to get this stuff under control.
Refs are not capable of doing the job
The officiating sucked !
Liked CC for a while but I think Sophia Cunningham is my favorite WNBA player now.
Sophie "The Enforcer" Cunningham
Ordered my #8 sophie jersey solely because of this play 🤣🤣💪
Why do they wear clothes
Roller Derby is back yay!!!
The Fever should sign Imane Khalif, NHL style.
LOL opportunity only because of Clark.
Lynx vs Fever will be wild!!
It's called black people jealous of a white girl that is 10 times better than them
On the Kobe ish hahaha
What we are seeing play out - on the WNBA stage - are the basest of women's  emotions. Jealousy. Envy. Arrested development of self driving players to commit crimes against Sport. - These crimes justified, in the stunted Bullies' minds,  because Caitlin Clark isn't just beating them on the court, she is trampling their souls. That's how they view Clark's utter domination (of them) in the very arena that they themselves had always dominated.  Simply put, their very sense of self - their value as a woman and person - is destroyed by Clark playing on such a higher level - so it is justified if they destroy her.  There is an aspect of sports, especially in basketball, where transcendent offense is unstoppable - Kareem, Jordan, Kobe, Shaq, Joker all completely demoralized defending players - often to the point that that defenders would foul-cheat-cry-backstab to try and stop them. However, there is a fundamental difference in the reaction (to Caitlin Clark) of WNBA women ...   Men will recognize greatness.  Finally a transcendent athlete will be recognized - like a warrior - for both surviving & bringing the Light of greater possibility to the battlefield (which the courts are a metaphor of).   Philosophical understanding allows us to transcend our base emotions. - There is Meaning in our battles. Even when losing (to a great one), we each represent our own part of the meaning found in conflict.  "I survived 10 rounds with Ali",  "Jordan once dunked on me in college", "I played Jokivich as a kid". . .   Unfortunately, the womens' game isn't grounded in the deeper meanings of the Pursuit of Greatness, nor tempered by  Mortality Fellowship. - Even heroes Fall, and all Great Ones fade. But at least they gifted us with a Moment that made us believe we could defy gravity, that we can strive for great things.   We all share such moments - Bolt's impossible 9:58,  Kobe's 81,  Messi's World Cup - reminding us that it is possible to not only survive but to even rise above the storm.   Women ground their values in more immediate measures, where self worth is reflected less from the Shared Universal Struggle than it is from the smaller battles of the day;  where small cuts are taken less as proud scars from surviving the greater war ( and pursuit if meaning) and more as personal slights  that cause the death of self. Rather than heal their own Purple Hearts, they continuously pick at perceived injury. Their dirty play is born of their fear, which becomes hatred. This then goes beyond the court, becoming  their fear of Death By A Thousand Held Onto Cuts.   These women don't find value in their losses, nor dobthey lessons that bond them, nor do they find their own greatness by association. Instead they are cultured to find personal offense in having their offenses defeated, self perpetuating in cycles of social debasing. The Great player isn't beating them in a game, but destroying their social value = Life. Then Sport isn't recognized as their very Existence is being overshadowed. This is why Sportsmanship is so soundly thrown out the window. "You are stealing My Light in this world!" means all rules are off. . .  The WNBA has been an social experiment, more than a Sports league,   where the Light found through success has been denied - by the funding of  base emotions. This has gone on so long, for decades, that the funders have created a toxic endemic culture of bullying and violence.   Pro-tracking girls have been pulled under the darkness of the WNBA umbrella.Prodigies are indulged in self-agrandizing over developing a sense of Fellowship.  They come up as Threats to Self, not as sporting rivals, and never as  Sisters in Arms.  Now we see the results. A player finally comes up, who brings a Light into the dark corner that has been the WNBA, and she becomes enemy #1, the enemy of all Selfs. This, the rise of a great player outside of the WNBA shadows, only happened because Caitlin Clark came up an outsider (to that system) - she instead grew up under the light of family, community, and recognizing God.   Clark has a sense of Fellowship - as shown by her love of loyalty mates, humble charity work, and tireless outreach to fans, and she is still the underdog  fighting the storm. This is why she is so widely loved. Clark is us. Clark is Spartacus.   Caitlin reminds us,when bringing light to those once shadowy courts of our human possibility. She reminds us of the up-and-comer-roots of sports, except for those who reject greater purpose & are caught in pursuing themselves in the shadows.   They will try to pull her into their shadows, but they can't see far enough beyond their own shadows to know, like Sophie, we won't let them.... We are Caitlin Clark.
Fever need to boycott the Cup.
Yesssah Sophie hahaha that is what goin' happens if yo mess with Caitlin Clark cheehoo you go Sophie 👏👏👏👏
And I agree the referee was on some BULLLLLLLLL
I want to congratulated Sophie and Lexie the only fever players to have CC back. Nathasha Howard were you going to ask Mabrey for a dance putting your arm around her like that. Didn't CC take a foul for you against Angel Reese for shoving you from behind earlier this year. Nice way to show your gratitude.
Caitlin Clark is holding the bag on the way out of the Bank
NBA loses stats WNBA gainin stats
CC took 3 flagrant fouls and walked away like a boss. The discipline of this woman is what you don't see in the nba
I didn’t know Sophie was a Black Belt by 6 years old, that’s badass! And even if she doesn’t train anymore, you don’t forget how to use your body or sit on a punch. Which most men don’t even know how to do.
They don’t have good basketball They have crap Basketball the only thing they have is one good player on one team nobody else cares about anything other than Caitlyn Clark the WNBA could disappear tomorrow it wouldn’t matter people would only miss Caitlyn .
I'd still love to know exactly why you guys went radio silent on Caitlin last year.
Dirtbag pistons? Watch it buddy
2:41 the most draymond player stat line that game 5 fouls a tec 2flagrants and 5 points 😅
I called that the joe rogan clinch 😂
The Suns played dirty, not hard. The wnba is in a critical situation because CC can take her game to Europe and make more money and get better endorsements. No one who started watching because of Caitlin will want to keep watching her get mugged.
That was absolutely busy league
Mabrey has that perma 3 weeks ago I had a baby, body.
Check the Plus/Minus Thugs always in the Minus. Mabry & the eye poker totaled like -40 thank you 🙏 🙏
The Connecticut Sun? Ahhh yes, Connecticut, the sunshine state. (Just looked up history of team). They are the Sun because they are owned by The Mohegan Tribe, and play at The Mohegan Sun Arena.   Whiteface comes ashore and they go from teepees to owning pro sports franchises? You’re welcome..hehe 😘 😘
TaeKwonDo Sophie.
First time homies ever worn a Panthers jersey in his life 🙄
Cunningham didn't do that for CC she did it because on the previous sun possession #7 flopped on Cunningham ankle trying to injure her watch it the Internet making it all about CC is what putting her in danger of getting injured your making it about CC when it's not that what putting a bullseye on her
I’m sorry Pat.  The Sun —WRONG! You can get physical, but when you fall outside those lines-pinching, gouging out eyes, pushing people on the floor.  SOMEONE could have gotten HURT.  Sophie’s flagrant was thought understandable and I hold the refs accountable!
this is the fifth year that the WNBA has done the Commissioner's Cup.  But this is the first time that the Fever have made the final game.  Also, within an hour after the Fever/Sun game concluded last night, the Minnesota Lynx clinched the Western Conference spot for the Cup, and the final will be at Minnesota as they have the better win percentage. Game will be held on July 1
Angel reese is a nobody
The hand grab behind the neck gave me Bane "Do you feel in charge?" vibes.
Clark should go play in Europe for 2 or 3 years. See how the wnba fares without her. Since the league won't protect her, nor will most of her teammates
so sophie is basically  Denis rodman but in a dress....oh wait
I am sorry but July is LeTour.  I like the drama in the WNBA.  Still not watching
Sofie is far from a goon. She'll drop 20 on you quick but doesn't need to
We got to get Stevie Wonder and Paul Mccartney to sing "Ebony and Ivory" in every WNBA game.
How much longer does this need to go on for?  I can’t even watch anymore…
George Soros funding the W 🤣🤣🤣
Clark starts a lot of fights,  but no one talks about it.
Ahhh!!! Beautiful goon u say!.. who can score..!! I chose u...,!!!
Sophie but that ass in a one hand Muay Tai clinch and told her whats up.
Fist fights are coming next.
Women bring drama even in sports. Wnba on lifetime
Her walk in every game is dope too.
Sick and tired of refs. Sick of WNBA, clean it up
Sophie!!! What a dawg!!!  Add smoking hot to the mix. Wow!!!
Lol it's like they don't want more fame and money by trying to hurt CC
Dirtbag pistons? Slapyoself
lol the WNBA is so incredibly stupid for doing this to their golden goose. Like how stupid can u be? Sheesh women are insanely jealous. Caitlin literally does nothing but play ball!!
The best part of this whole video is Pat holding back his laugh when he mentioned the WNBA possibly holding out 😂
They should have brought in Tasha St. Cloud as well
Need CC to throw a 360 windmill either dunk or haymaker on these fools!!
Give Katelin goggles
After seeing another angle where Sheldon lowers her shoulder and tries to knock Cunningham on her a** I would argue there's more to it than just sticking up for CC.
She had too, CC would have got her ass kicked
I don't watch basketball but Caitlin Clark caught my attention when I found out she broke 62 records in her rookie season, and it's been amazing watching her. She is proof that we are not all created equally, and that's hard for people to deal with.
People will continue to ignore how raysist / jealous these women are
I never heard of a 6 year old getting a black belt in Tia Kwon Do.. They called Sophie the Enforcer on her last Team  Phoenix I think.
I would like to see 51 take many more shots at the hoop,and I prey Mitchell will practice her shots. Ore,she missed lots of shots
No such thing as a black belt at 6
Let the WNBA fight like the NBA in the 80's, I love it and miss the passion the NBA had.
The problem with the Sun being physical and standing on business is that they're the worst team in the league by far. They have nothing to play for. Don't be bush.
My favorite was when the WNBA made Clark say that fans like her because of her “white privilege.”
Caitlin should file assault charges with the police if the WNBA can’t deal with it
I love when it’s white on white physicality because now they can’t use their “Thug” or “ghetto“ or “classless” narratives, NOW! It’s exciting! 😂😂😂👀maybe we can just move forward and enjoy the sport now.🤙🏾🍻
CC is weak. She can't seem to be able to stand up for herself when fouled. Always choose to walk away from adversity and play drama. Learn from Sophie!  That's how you get back at your opponent and stop being a cry baby. Go Sophie !!! Respect to you !!!
Sophie “McSorley” Cunningham.
The bots...OMG!!! They are like CC flopping. Then you watch it and that girl runs at her full speed and chest bumps her. Either they are trolling or stupid.
I wanna point out that Lexie did jump in to try and help stop Sheldon, but it's being overlooked.
Sophie is gonna be the Rodman of the WNBA. LFG!
The WNBA needs to step up with their officiating! That foul wouldn't even have been allowed in the 80's NBA!
Caitlin playing "Larry Bird" now. "You can't stop me!" LOVE IT!
This is one of the reasons that they brought Cunningham in is for her defense and her hard nose and no back down attitude, she is the hockey equivalent of the GOON!!!!
Caitlin Clark should leave the irrelevant and racist WNBA and join another league that is going to pay her more and treat her better. The fans will drop WNBA and move to the new league immediately.
We all know why this stuff keeps happening to her
The league has always been a joke. Still a joke it seems
I want a testosterone level drawn on Mabrey.
Sydney broke Sophie's tooth the last time they played against each other so shes been waiting for the perfect moment to get back at her.
The physicality that Caitlin Clark gets was happening before Caitlin Clark.
The game against the Liberty should have been the Liberty's 2nd loss to Indiana. Refs screw the Fever every chance they get
the number one injury in woman's basketball is EYE INJURIES...it's time for CC to wear goggles. Especially with the 'W"NBA's refusal to have rules regarding fingernail length!!!
And somehow CC ended up with a technical on that play lol.  The coach was awesome in the past game conference as well!
They will play the lynx in minnesota on friday July 1st for the commie cup
her teammates saw her get knocked down and didnt do a THING
In Indianapolis you can't find a Sophie Cunningham jersey ANYWHERE. They sold out overnight after that.
Would the NBA allow this to happen to Steph, SGA, etc? If not….fix it.
Wait!! Where's the racist stuff at? I thought it was just the black girls jealous? All the bigots that rush to support Caitlin can't do anything.😅. But that Cunningham is a smoke show that can fight. Put her in some commercials.
The fever need a player like Charles Oakley! Players were afraid to get too rough with MJ when he was there.
So McAfee likes to see basketball players roughing each other up. Thug players combined with severely bad refs get people hurt period! There's no debate. If this activity hurts the cash cow, the league is done! MacAfee is not an authority to look to for the game of basketball.
Baby girl got that Bill Laimbeer look in her eyes 👀😤🔥🔥
The black women on the team won't protect Clark, except maybe Boston.
Refs are dogshit. Everyone continues to be jealous of cc. Same old thing
Wish Sophie was on the floor when PUG bellied her. Give her the  old Muay Thai knee to face! Howard just stood and watched her girl get wrecked SMH
EXACTLY!   she was friend, a badass friend!
Right on about Sophie enforcing, and about Caitlin unusual connection with the crowd, a star, a dog, will continue to be must watch, and Sophie must watch, too.
She is the wnba.
Dirtbag Detroit Pistons!?! FU! You suck as much as the ugly Florida Panthers jersey sucks.  You’re the dirtbag.
I guess they wont be happy until they unalive her
There's a picture of Sheldon actually grabbing the skin of Clark's upper arm with her four fingers pinching her.
Women operate out of jealousy, just human nature.
I agree the cheap shots got too go, or we doing a Rudy tomlanavich!
Refs allow a poke in the eye from Sheldon + intentional body shot from Mabrey, and then allow play but then eject Sophie Cunningham. Awful officiating.
Get Sophie on the show!
You can’t stand up for a player 2 quarters later out of revenge. Weird vibe from McAfee but no surprise. Caitlin Clark is the Israel of the WNBA. The player who gets to play victim even when she starts fights.
CC is no joke.  It’s time to get AB involved in the headhunter business
CC can't be acting like she is tough and be flopping like Lebron and Steph.
That panthers jersey is ill!
Cunningham is BA!
Imagine a bunch of white girls beating up on one black girl just because she’s better than them. Double standards. These girls are petty & don’t deserve our attention
Caitlin has me so close to watching a WNBA game, so close.
CC has millions of dollars--she should pay the girls 5k for each time they take someone out on her account. Because they'll be fined--dont forget that....and most of them dont make a lot of money. I make almost double what an "W"NBA player makes as a second year attorney.
Theres ignorance and then theres stupidity!! To try and hurt the girl bringing the eyes and the money to this dead ass league????????? How stupid can you possibly be????
I also love that she went 3 for 3 directly afterwards. The refs should be embarrassed for themselves
blackbelt at the age of six is IMPOSSIBLE. That was from a McDojo.Come on with that stuff.
Half of CC's turnovers are passes the team can't catch lmao. There's improvement from last year, but still room for better #'s there. Mitchell needs to stop shooting the ball from 3 and get in the goddam paint where she cooks. It's nice to see them running again though.
Say can they make a go fund for Sophie’s fines for the future for when she gets those falls for protecting cc
and STILL there is NO RULE on fingernail length in the "W"NBA
those mofos stood there and watch ...WDF
Yeah, Yeah, people! WNBA is Panthering up! This is becoming great sports viewing. Conneticut starts with their Panthering and then Cunningham passes her beer and follows up with some Marchand/Benett level Panthering. Loving this from Canada.
Sophie is CC protector. She is a black belt in Taekwondo.
Couldn't help but notice SC didn't go after MM lol
Sophie stood on business that wrap up after was legendary
Natasha Howard did absolutely nothing after CC got pushed. She didn't even flinch. Trade her ass.
Pay Sophie’s fine! They don’t make much
Sophie ...Black belt on age 6? Caitlin got her enforcer 😉
Man AB and Howard had clean looks in the moment, but they are soft. If Sophie was in the game when that happened? Murk city. Fever need to toughen up as a whole. Hull got in there a lil bit.
Jacy was at a disadvantage
Did anyone notice Sophie grab  lacy when she was going full speed to the basket. Black people and White people see things different for sure.  Toe to toe would be considered an enforcer. That was more of a cheap shot .
He doesn't watch Ohio st women's basketball she has a motor but isn't good at all
I wonder what it would take for CC to bring back the 'you can't see me' hand action back?? What would be the people's and players response to that I wonder?
Sophie is doing what she said she would do before the season started!! Her word is nice.
Stupid.  You are supporting those jealous women trying to hurt Caitlin?
Where is AB in helping CC?
Yawn - burp - maybe someday they can beat high school teams.
Reese is a thug. Mabrey is a thug. Carrington is a thug. Chennedy was a thug. Call it like it is. Players are being greenlit by league management and refs and some analysts to be violent--McNut said today on ESPN--it's all part of the game re: CC getting her face clawed--maybe McNut was thug too.
I  love the spirit. Go Caitlin!  But man these guys watch zero of the other teams in the WNBA as they mispronounced names and didn't know the simple history of the Commissioner's cup...but hey the fact that the WNBA gets mentioned at all is a credit for Caitlin..but 100% these guys know about .01% about the WNBA..Marina Mabrey is a Huge name in the WNBA...and they called her Marion....lmfao!!!!  but OK guys...at least you're trying but please have at least one guy assigned to watch the WNBA so you don''t look silly like you did today...
They didn’t do enough when it counted. Nobody checked Mabry when she cheap shot CC.
Sophie ❤❤❤❤ Enforcer.  Sheldon deserved IT. She grabbed CC skin on her arms n twisted it all night. WTF DIRTY AZZ THUG.
She put her in the clinch and whispered some sweets things to her. Sheldon backed off after that haha.
wait till Bryan Griner gets ahold of CC 😂😂😂😂 CC BUST THAT MANS ASS
That's nice, but where was the rest of the team?
Damn she’s fine
Sheldon had 2 points at the time and couldn't guard Clark.... Everyone knows what she was trying to do. I'm good with physical, but you never do anything that could end someone's career. Eye gouges are out, taking out someones legs (like Sheldon did the game before)
There's a reason nobody cared about the wnba & the thugs from the Sun. Just everyone reminded why.
Enough with the Long Nails …  Stupid referees- There is multiple professional angles - - - of the whole GAME  - Proving they ((( Refs ))) are Horrible at their jobs …
Missouri girls built different 😍
It’s just like somebody trying to take a cheap shot on the quarterback. You better believe that o lines gonna start pushing fools.
You do such a good job hyping, but unfortunately watching the actual game it's just so bad.  Basic things like catching a decent pass just doesn't happen consistently.
The Fever should hire two bodyguards to watch games from their bench. You know, just in case.
At the .42 second mark you see perfectly their entire team was on Sophie and all 4 Fever players at the back doing basically nothing. Only saw 2 players have CC's back, Sophie y Lexie. Howard y Boston did nothing when the Caitlin attack was happening.
From yeah we need some of her black team mates to get with the gang bang bang of else it'll be racist, LFG Mitchell and AB
And AB and Howard just stood there!!!  Shame on them!!!!!
This is ironic, the WNBA is now tougher the NBA.  Probably gets more views now too.  Way to go Caitlin and Sophie! NBA, get back to your roots!!
The W players are bent on destroying CC’s career and the commieissioner will celebrate.
Caitlin a beast
Sophie, or should we call her 'Crazy 8', is handling the aftermath as the refs are doing literally ZERO.
Sophie Cunningham = Anthony Mason of the New York knicks
Cunningham, serving as the team's enforcer and a steadfast defender of star teammate Caitlin Clark, became the center of attention after a heated incident late in the game. With Cunningham stepping up for Clark during a physical matchup, her jersey sales skyrocketed, selling out within hours.
This is exactly what the W needs. Force Caitlyn to get the buckets, because she 100% will. Her cooking with not energy from the other team is cool, but if they are fighting for it and forcing CC to be at her best it'll only be good for the league. Nothing that's happened to her is a legit injury risk. It's just good hard pushes and body checks. Forced Jordan to be great. Forced Steph to be great. You just know CC loves it too
How ya doin, keep it movin’!  Nice, Pat!!!
Anti white agenda of the woke/espn/democrat party
CC FANS ARE SO ANNOYING PERIOD🙄!!!!
Some good players in wnba. One great player who is the only one who are generating crowds and ratings.  Proven when she was injured.
OMFG the sensationalism is palpable, Sophie didn't stand up for CC at all it is a totally different play. All Sophie did was hard check someone that didn't like it, END OF STORY, move along.
Garbage fake league underwritten by the NBA or would not exist. All-time move was when Robert Johnson threw the keys to the Sting back to the NBA and said "thank but no thanks." Stern had zero recourse. Caitlin should go play in Europe far away from the toxic, dysfunctional culture of the WNBA.
Always good to see someone representing their state. Sophie standing on business saying "show me" MFer! "Show me"!
Sabrina shoots her 3-pointers from a much shorter distance than Cark.  In fact it's not even close.  Actually, Clark shoots 3's at an average distance greater than Curry. Caitlin Clark's average 3-point shooting distance in her debut season (28.09 feet) surpasses that of Stephen Curry (27.58 feet). Her current average distance is 28.7 feet, 13.4 inches farther than Curry.  Clark is a completely different beast.  There's a new sheriff in the WNBA, and her name is Caitlin Clark, the girl with the supernova DNA.  Also, there were 35 flagrant fouls called this year in the WNBA 34 if you exclude Diana Taurasi’s later-removed call. Values in parentheses represent percentages without this flagrant. Example: 34/35 and 34/34 reported as 97% (100%). Players fouling Caitlin Clark accounted for 17.1% (17.6%) of all flagrants last year. 11.4% (11.8%) of all flagrant fouls were Chicago Sky players fouling Caitlin Clark .
It was the Ref's job to put an end to this from the very beginning of the game, but they didn't and it evolved into this chaos.  Unbelievable.  The Ref's should be ejected.
What do y’all expect? It’s a women’s sport, so of course it's going to be dramatic. They’re all drama queens Haha but that’s what makes it entertaining.
Sophie was looking like Dakota Ditcheva in the clinch lol😂
WNBA = Good Ole Fashioned Football - Pat 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Cunningham is the embodiment of Charles Oakley, love it! Every team needs a player like that.
Refs need to issue pre game warnings - any player involved with violent and potentially injurious behavior will be ejected. No timid referees needed. No need for 20 minute film reviews - just do it
Who wants a UFC style match on pay per view with Cunningham vs Sheldon?  Use the money to hire better refs.😊
Hey Pat... if you're going to take somebody's job on commentary at WWE, MAYBE TRY SHOWING UP AND NOT MISSING MULTIPLE WEEKS
GO SUNS!!!
Sassy Sophie!❤️
Let a naysayer know!!
Stop treat her like a little lamb. She's a big girl. And invitesth physicality
About time
If I was coach, I would bench a few of the Indiana bigs that never step in for their battered teammate.   There's an Indiana player right behind the player that leveled Clark after the eye poke.   She does nothing!   That's the first unwritten rule for any team sports.
Yeah reminds me of a NBA game in the 80s. Just with terrible refs
The Piston Bad Boys was over 35 years ago.  Stone Ages.  The NFL and NBA no longer allow their stars to be turned to lunch meat.
Sophie is the necessary Draymond on that team. CC has the biggest target on her back.
Sophie's doing the smart thing. You want to get in good with a rising star.
Chick Ball is still CHICK BALL.
Sophie Gang.
Ohio State players are always trash without any character... Just look at the college football team . No class
Sophie is my new favorite player, she stood on business, finally someone had her back
Batting CC around like a pinball.
Cunningham is a fuckin beast and a hell of a teammate!  Ladies that’s called honor and having your teammates back.  If your team mate gets smashed it’s on.  Instantly!  That’s how we rolled in the 90’s
Nobody cares about the wnba
Finally the WNBA has a great player bringing in views and helping the sport and the league and espn want her to get broken and leave the game gotta love the WNBA
Okay, so I’ve never watched a wnba game or a single girls  college basketball game. But have heard enough about Caitlyn to make me curious cause I am an admirer of great players. I’ve seen enough of Caitlyn skills to see she’s supremely talented in alot of facets. But.. her whining at every turn and body language is not admirable. Now that I see this about her I can’t unsee it.. and I see why all the girls hate her and why her teammates won’t stand up for her.
Go live in Connecticut
During the Cunningham brawl notice how many Sun's player are there and how few fever players...Howard Boston none of them will defend Caitlin..
Patrick is no tough guy 😅😅
Sophie, the trophy gun in hand, Cunningham
Petition to get Liz Cambage to the Fever
I was already a fan of Sophie Cunningham but she might just be my new favourite WNBA player.  This was her putting the league on notice. If the refs aren't going to punish you for assaulting her teammates, she is going to.
Shes not part of the rainbow cult.🤔
As much as I love the WNBA, until they stop losing money I'd tell the players where they can shove their CBA.
Junior HS refs.
I seen a video of Sophie after the poke to Caitlyn's eye and blind side, Sophie was on the sidelines and the coaches had to hold her back
It’s about time
That was a anderson Silva palm grip at the end
Rivalry is great, but mugging someone on the court is not.
Sabrina is good until she plays a random Philippine high school boy and get La lit up.
Get Sophie on the show!!!!!
Time for a spin off league poaching the top players?
In Football if a Defender Burps with a 3 yard radius of Patrick Mahomes there's a Flag or an Ejection. Open season on CC & it's Criminal! 😡🙏😡
Man they can try to make this league sound exciting but it is not. CC is truly a bad ass but man most of this crap is unwatchable…. And I hate to burst bubbles but most women don’t watch sports and most men don’t wanna watch sports because where women act like men.
After the play Sophie was attacked by two players she grad one of on the throat with her right hand and fighting the other with her left hand  and then Sophie broke lose on the them two on one it a lot of people and security to Sophie of Thanos players she was giving them a beat down remember people Sophie had a black belt In she not afraid of no one we love you Sophie
Last year same team different player so 2 years in a row with an eye poke from the ct sun
I don't watch the WNBA but LET'S GO CC!!
Why are 90% of these players lesbians?
I can't believe that I actually care about the wnba! I don't even watch the nba! Sophie cunningham is a bad gyal
YOU WHITE PEOPLE CAN'T HANDLE THIS GAME.
Sophie said "if you ef with Caitlin, you ef with me beotch❤❤❤❤
Wonder why Indiana had to get a white girl to protect her.
Sophie ticks so many boxes 😊
the irony of college bb being more professional than 'professional' bb league.
KNOCK CC BLOCK OFF.
from the angle i saw last night it looked like the black chick barely pushed CC and she flopped, but from this angle u can tell it was the white chick who slammed into her
Remember the dream team movie after Jordan lit up magic Johnson’s squad in 5v5. And magic said Jordan walked in the room and said “There’s a new sheriff in town.“. Kinda has that vibe to it. Not saying she’s MJ or anything crazy like that but it has that kinda vibe to it
Same chick chipped Sophie's tooth in earlier game
sophie manhandles an eye poking psycho with a clinch and this pathetic shows replays the worst angel of it over and over while failing to give proper context.. you have one job, you buffoons
I’m sure Caitlin would pay her teammates fines. They have nothing to lose.
Sheldon tried to break Sophie's ankle last game, followed up last game Sheldon pulled Sophie's damaged ankle....😢
Sophie is hot..and see can fight 😛
The WNBA is like watching old school roller derby. Just a hot mess.
Hey Pat, there's another video that shows Stephanie White holding back Sophie Cunningham from getting involved, you need to check that out, priceless moment 🤣🤣🤣👍
They need Sophie to be the enforcer Because the other team keeps  Hammering Catlin the whole game  Sophie is a black belt since she was 6 years old. Good luck Hater's keep up your ignorant crap. The league doesn't care  Bunch of losers
MIZZOU GIRL DEFENDING A HAWKEYE....!!  👍❤👍❤
More fist fights in WNBA
The WNBA is consistently violating OSHA regulations, the feds should get involved
Eye gouging ehhh foul Slap hands away from eye gouger that’s a foul
Sophie played high school football so not afraid to tackle
Cunningham is fine AF
Woke N Broke Association at it’s finest
Does CC talk trash? Yeah, but she backs it up like Larry Bird and Reggie Miller did. It still doesn't justify the opposing team being dirty and Bush League.
The Refs should be the ones to receive fines!
Caitlin Clark a Karen
Caitlin clark is the best female basketball player in the world, sophie cunningham is down with this S
They should just let’em go like the 80s NBA. It’s already ultra dramatic. The ratings will go up fa sho
Even the refs hate Clark wild
All the refs in that game should be fired I am tired of refs letting other players try to hurt cc.dont they know that cc is good for the fever and whoever they play.refs please do you're job and protect all players they just want to play basketball.not be in the UFC Go fever cc stay safe
What connecticut does is dirty play not competitive play.  It's disgusting and not entertaining in the least.
ANTI WHITE ANTI STRAIGHT ASSAULT AND BATTERY.
Don’t F*CK with Black Belt Barbie🔥She instinctually grabbed Jacy’s neck and almost threw a flying knee UFC style😵‍💫We need you girl, good choice😂
Getting sophie jersey she held he head hahaha in a fight that's a knee to the face
Love me some Sophie Cunningham!
LOL THE DIRT BAG DETROIT PISTONS 😂
YOU DON'T SEE ANYONE ON THE NEW YORK LIBERTY OR INDIANA FEVER TRYING TO HURT OTHER PLAYERS PURPOSELY OUT OF JEALOUSY.  THAT IS SICK BEHAVIOR.  THE WNBA NEED TO OPEN A SPECIAL DEPARTMENT FOR THE "MENTALLY AFFECTED PLAYERS"!
Check out lexie too. She bucked up to that sheldon girl too
Sophie goin BEAST MODE 🥊🥊
They may need men refs
Promoting the Commissioner's Cup championship game without CC on the poster. They're not even trying to hide their disdain for her.
Starting to look like hockey.
Women are so jealous and nasty and it shows in the WNBA 😂 If CC had more melanin this wouldn’t be happening. She’s be praised and loved by the media and the players. She is the only reason anyone is watching the WNBA.
CC#22 AND SOPHIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  GREATEST EVER!!!!!!!    WE ARE HERE TO WATCH THE GREATEST BALLERS EVER, BUT THE GHETTO BALL, CHEAP SHOTS, EYE GOUGING IS A DISGRACE TO THE WNBA!!!  PLAY GOOD CLEAN BALL AND SHOW PROFESSIONAL SPORTSMANSHIP ON THAT COURT!!!
the entire W needs to he investigated for bounties the same way the nfl was i guarantee coaches are paying players to go after clark
If the WNBA refs weren't worse than NBA refs, Sophie wouldn't have to 'level the field.' Sophie my gurl!!
Sophie got more than fight tho.......
Her black teammates will never have Clark’s back especially if the person going after Clark is black on the other team and that’s a fact. Blacks are the most racist ppl in the country yeah I said it.
It is supposed to be BASKETBALL NOT WMMA- they better clean this up if they are going to have any credibility as a legitimate league.
Thats some white markieff morris ish
Caitlin is probably better then 75% of the NBA players.  She needs to get paid.
Commissioners cup photo and CC isn't in it. WTF. I hate the WNBA.
if i were cc, id just go to europe and play ball.
Dei league protecting dei refs!!
Why aren't any of the other teammates stepping in for her...They needed at least two enforcers..
She should feel honored Sophie kicked her butt
Sophie was running in front of the opponent, that disgusting animal lowered her shoulder to hit her, Sophie avoided it with a foul and then didn't act scared when animal1 got in her face to ass*ult her too, and animal2 grabbed her by the throat.
I think it  was for roll up on Sophie's ankle more than sticking  up for CC.
BS-YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSE TO GO FOR A PLAYERS EYES. BS BS BS BS
The REFS were HORRIBLE, when is the League going to address this? Griner's gender is in question, when are they going to address this? Thug basketball prevails because of the talent of CC, the others can't match her talent! There are so many good players in this league, but the THUG mentality over shadows the good players.
The CC haters like McNutts should pay attention to this easy 9 minute clip.
Sophie is unbelievably hot.
She’s not the only talented but she is the most talented
I have huge problems with these eye gouges and the long finger nails.  That needs to get cleaned up by the league. No long nails.
Terrible officiating. I'm good with the Cunningham foul. Mabrey should have been ejected.
Sofie's jersey sold out quick after the game!!!
You have a big platform Pat if u keep calling out the bad actors changes might happen thanks for covering the fever and CC
The wnba loses money every year these broads DO NOT deserve more money fuc outta here
Straighten out Stephen A & Mc NUT regarding CC !!!
Platforms like yours must be a change agent for the WNBA!?!! 🤔
Just FYI, those refs are stuck in their old ways when no one was watching the WNBA. Fire them.
Pats editors gotta get better highlights edited up for them lol. Missing all the best angles and moments.
Refs and league office need to get a hold on this. It's not the WWE
As i understand it, after Sofie  got payback for CC her jersey was sold out the next day
These women are violent and out of control.
ESPN will not show CC's stats ! Go to ESPN next game up for the Fever hit Fever logo then hit stats !!! That is the only way to see her stats  ! McAffee help get CC's stats put out on ESPN !
If something happens and CC does get hurt. All of her haters are not going to take the blame.  They are going to blame the refs b/c they have been letting it happen. Trash talking 100% allowed. You can be physical without bumping, shoving, pinching and poking the eyes.  Those things are 100% dirty. Sheldon and Mabrey probably acted like this because they are on the worst team and they wanted some media attention.
The way Sophie schooled Jacy during the altercation took me TF out 😂 Jacy deserved it, but the refs deserves worse.
The WBNA refs have to be paid off not to call many many fouls against Catlin Clark! And I do believe it's racist because she is white! It's a total shame. If it wasn't for her they would still be playing to a few thousand in a small arena the size of a collage court. How stupid is this league?
That NOW YOU KNOW merch is on point.
She is the Jackie Robinson on the WMBA, both the strait and white thing.
Talk to your buddy Dakich.....  he's got his head stuck up his ass....
I love Sophie.  She stands on business and doesn't let dirty players tee off on her teammates.  Sophie rag dolled Jacy Sheldon and was telling her about it the whole time.  Mabrey should have been tossed out of that game.
CC > Entire wnba league. She's white, she's more skilled, she's not some ratchet-ass slag from the street and shes' absolutely despised for it all. They're trying to permanently injure her hence why they keep going for her eyes.
I think the only competition i might be interested in...as it pertains to women....might be fights. And not MMA or Boxing. Street fights. I feel the same about Hockey. I only want to see fights. The WNBA would be quite smart to just start making chick fights part of every game. Put enforcers on teams.
Caitlin Clark is missing from the Commissioner's Cup poster. Also her stats are missing from the ESPN website and the WNBA website. She should be near the top in almost every category except rebounding where she is mid.
I KNEW Cunningham had to have some type of fight training the way she immediately grabbed the girls head and got control 😂
CC weight trained daily in the off season. It’s showing
ANOTHER SEGMENT OF HOW NOT TO HELP. GOTTA FLAGRANT FOUL THESE DIRTY SHOTS OUT EARLY TO SEE WHO CAN PLAY BASIC PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL. CLARK WILL NEVER REALLY SHINE BECAUSE SHE WILL BE GONE BY INJURY DO TO SHITTYTTY INEPT DEI ORGANIZED INEPTNESS..  I THOUGHT IT WAS NO KINGS LAST NIGHT AGAINST CAITLIN, AND HER FANS WASN'T HAVING IT.  SOFIE TEACHING PROFESSIONAL REVENGE LESSONS. SHES DEFINITELY A ALBINO GORILLA.
Watch what happens if Clark decides she's had enough and leaves the league... Show them the reality of how fast it would sink
That was a randy orton tier eye poke
Sophie is forever GOATED
Sooo Feee  Sooo Feee   Sooo Feee!!!!!
Why is CC teammates not like Sophie, i get disappointed watching everyone stand around while cc gets blindsided . smh
Howard and Boston should be ashamed. this is the second time for Boston to do nothing.
CC needs to defend herself. She’s supposed to be a baller. Ballers don’t take no sh*t. Throw some bows, hip check them into the court side seats! Jus sayin’
Sophie to Jacy in the clinch:  "That's for breaking my tooth" last match.
Lexus Hull was there to protect CC.   Physically doesn't belong in women's BB.  Its the play Caitlin plays is what people like to watch!  Not this aggression!
I’m just angry that nobody is mentioning that perfect Thai clinch, just beautiful technique
Disappointed with Howard. She should have been in Tina Charles face. Do something when your teammate is assaulted. It's one of the reasons you're there. All you did was just walk on by.
That Cunningham jersey is gonna be sold out
Sophie business
They just upgraded Maybreys foul to a flagrant 2. So she should've been ejected, so according to the wnba the refs messed up by not ejecting her
Sheldon should fear Sophie Cunningham Lol
There’s an exposure problem here. Most of these ingrates are not ready for prime time. That’s just gonna make the Fever the rulers of this domain.
No its racis
WNBA thugs. Unwatchable
Crazy their doing this to caitlyn
Sophie is sexy and fights for teammates, definitely wifey material 😤
I hate basketball, hardely watch it unless its some big game, especially don't watch WNBA, but this had be turning in. And come on, that Sophie is a smoke show
This isn't rivalry you dope.  It's assault and battery
She blocked AB on X because he suggested that maybe she keeps it hairy.
Theres alot of going on, but there is still a whole lotta very very bad basketball, if you actually watch a full game its still kinda hard to watch, but at least they are making good story lines like the NBA in the 90's. The WNBA cant excite us with dunks, but the Drama man the Drama is gold
The only draw is CC. The numbers back it up.
cc needs to start pushing back on her own
They have upgrade mabrey foul to flagrant 2 the league did
Are the other players the only ones who don’t know the only reason anyone is watching is because of her. It’s like they are mad at her for bringing attention to the sport
Sophie  ,jerseys are sold out ,after last night
That eye poke came out of nowhere.  Not even close to the ball or her hands.  Dirty dirty dirty.
PAT HOW ARE THE PACERS DOING ?
N
WWE on the basket ball court.
Good Thing Sophie has her back but where the hell is Boston? She should be in there protecting her teammate as well. Really good scorer off of Clarks feeds but she needs to show some fight in protecting Catlin.
Wow, u blind side my star player like that... won't see that NBA, where's the enforcer at.... M.I.A.
SOPHIE DESERVES A PARADE IN INDY!...She's a Super-Hero without a Cape...And her jersey SOLD OUT (AGAIN)
Sophie 💪      Awesome to watch!!!!
I thought the WNBA was all about Social Justice, that's what you got when the Fever responded to all the physical play by; CC shooting a 3pt over JS and Sophie's take down foul of JS, in the absence of competent officiating, business will get handled! The Fever used Behavior Modification 101 strategy to make a point! 😎😎😎
Payback for Sheldon breaking Sophie broken tooth and and ankle injury last game
Its crazy how no one else stands up for CC except Sophie.
Ayy I want to see a bump in those sophie cunnigham jersey sales
I have a question. Why won't Caitlin Clark stand up for Caitlin Clark? She gets punked constantly and always slinks off like a meek little lamb. She will never be respected by her peers if she doesn't defend herself.
indeed, she is letting the naysayers know
Caitlin "THE ASSASSIN" and Sophie "THE ENFORCER"
anyone else convinced pat mcafee cranks it out in bathroom stalls at wnba arenas?
I love when competition gets spicey, but easy on the cheap shots
It's disgusting the way catlin is being treated by the commissioner  and ref s is so bad business for the league common sence
The entire Indiana team needs to make a public statement to the WNBA by saying "There's obvious intentional foul play against Caitlin across the league, if the League doesn't want to address that and keep other players in check to protect Caitlin from getting injured then we'll check other players for them and the WNBA will not like the way that we do it. We will defend her at all costs"
Love the competitive nature, all day! Poke in the eye, cheap shot BS!!! Stay away from the eyes. That's twice now.
Sophie Cunningham is too talented a player to be called a goon. Yes she will stand up to anyone messing with her (Two different incidents of CT trying to reinjure her ankle last night) or her teammates. Sophie is a FIERCE Hooper!
These women need the drama because the skill level with most of them is so bad they cant talk with skill which is why we get eye pokes and pushed when she not looking 😂😂 and Cc says oh yeah watch this while i hit these 3s in your face 😂😂
Finally someone stuck up for her… surprisingly it’s the hot one!!
Old heads yesterday: Uh.... WNBA is on. Skipping that.  Old heads today: WNBA is the only real sports league left! NBA is soft. NFL is soft.
If CC keeps it up, maybe ESPN will add her to their stats page where she is conspicuously missing from points (2nd), Rebounds (~20th), and Assists (1st by FAR).  Props to ESPN though they at least had her 3.7 3's per game
Looks like they found her her Oakley.
The WNBA should make a 4 point shooting line about 3 feet away from the three-point line that would bring in millions more viewers.
Pat, maybe the NfL should adopt the hand to hand contact for the defenders on receivers
The WNBA should make a 4 point shooting line about 3 feet away from the three-point line that would bring in millions more viewers.
Sophie is gangster
If ppl didn't know who Sophie was, now they do😅. That takedown was glorious😂
Freaking refs should be fined & suspended for all the misses & non foul/ejection calls they keep missing. How can a player who just got poked in the eyes get a foul called against them? Then gets pushed down by a weak ass player cheap shot & not get kicked out of the game? And the refs saw it all happen on replay that takes them forever to figure out. How was the WNBA's ratings while CC was out? Miss at least 1 million viewers. Angel "can't make a layup" Reese doesn't cause that cause she suck.
WNBA has proven that no one hates woman more than woman. This is insane how they treat each other. These woman have an amazing opportunity to grow their sport. And these players can't keep up with CC.
u think wnba will allow a indiana team to win? lol NBA wont.
Finally, a good take. A guy who understands. The WNBA isn’t going to correct this so the Fever are  going to have to police it themselves.
We need some Sophie Cunn all star votes!! love her
WNBA fined caitlin clark, they should have resending her tech. She was trying to see. Complete disgrace by WNBA. It's still not good enough. People  are watching as never before. And this is what they see? An attack against Caitlin.
It is pretty cool to find out that some of the players in the WNBA are ballers.
Unbelievably bad performance by the referees. How the one knocking Caitlin Clark down wasn't ejected is beyond me. Love Sophie Cunningham standing up to the BS.
Go back and watch the Jordan doc The Last Dance, this is just like how he was treated in the 80s.
The enforcer shipie kannigem 👍 in the home 🏠wnba 🤠🤠🤠🌏🙄🙄🙄
Sophie has looks and can whoop som..
Cute white girls took over basketball and the RACIST DEMOCRATS AND BLACK WOMEN  HATE IT 😂😂😂😂😂
Dbut says shes a stud lol poor choice of words for wnba players
No Pat, we dont like the physicality like that from the sun. Stand on one side not both
The only storyline is CC. Nothing else. Did you see the ratings when she off the court. WNBA is dead without her
I just understand letting your golden goose get cooked. No, don't call fouls that aren't there, but when legitimate ones happen over and over with no calls, there's a real problem.
Isn't this really about the 12th or 15th time CC has been seriously assaulted. For one, this was pre planned as all 3 stepped into action once it started.  Seem like some are conspiring and planning. This is not organic. DOJ needs to investigate the WNBA immediately, and everyone who has participated. Including the refs, players and all teams involved.
About time, the rest of the team needs to step up for her too
The refs fk'd up when they didn't toss Mabry. YOu get what you get.
No disrespect, but these are the best women’s ball highlights I’ve ever seen.
Lucky Sophie didn't whoop does asses 😊
CC is to the WNBA what Magic and Bird were for the NBA.
Really afraif of the woke lesbian racist ladies at ESPN still huh Pat???😂😅 Well enjoy Caitlyn while it lasts cause these jealous yas queens r keep this up till her frail female body has had enough in 2 years and she's done....then the "W" will b big time 😅
Teammates need to STEP UP or this is going to keep happening
Let's face it she's a white stright Christian that's everything that league is against!! Wokeness is a plague.
Only one story bud.. and it's CC
As soon as I saw Sophie with the neck control I pulled up google. Yep, Sophie is a black belt in Taekwondo 😵😵
Let them fight like hockey in the WNBA, they want equal pay we need equal entertainment
Goons lol
Atleast this time it wasn’t a racial foul
Good on her only teammate in the league.
CC is a complete DAWG love it
Finally Somebody is stepping in to protect Caitlin from These crazy Thug Bitches....
Welp they speak like she’s Jordan. Well Jordan got the “Bad Boy” treatment.🤷🏾‍♂️ it’ll just make her better 💯
Caitlin makes Boston look great and Boston hasn't stood up for her once
Well done fighting back the laughter when you said there could be a holdout haha
League would rather go straight back down to 0 viewers than to protect the face of the WNBA lmao
Other players of the WNBA envy the success that CCs brought to the league. They have to realize that if they just stick to playing ball and outplaying her, there wouldn’t be so much outrage and they can beat her without playing dirty.  These cat fights that always break out  where all these jealous women get in her face or try causing her to get injured needs to stop.   Was it this way when MJ was running the league back in the 90s? He single handedly put the NBA back on the map, and plenty of players back then through today are grateful for his contributions to the league.   The WNBA players need to get on board with the rise of Caitlin Clark and stop being divas because they’re not in the spotlight
2:59  Did he just call CC an asshole?  After calling her a dog....
THIS IS CAITLINS LEAGUE
It’s like the WMBA is trying to stay unpopular
