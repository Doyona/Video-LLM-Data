This song always made me think of an older guy that finally bought a truck after having a car for years because of wife and kids but now he’s back in a truck and just rips it down a dirt road or highway
Madden 26
Yup, im digging this song.
Man I would be absolutely killer if Dale Jr made it an actual comeback to nascar. They could use his popularity and he could use a championship
Thought it was gonna be an Aerosmith cover :(
Yuck
Better and better every time i hear him!! @luke combs
THIS GOES SO HARD!!!!!
Best song ever wrote besides backup plan.
Awesome track 👍👍
Anybody else here after the EwwDirtVegas Instagram post? No...? Just me? OK.      Green Bike. Headphones in when you find it. 🎧

This song in Madden 26
Old Cowboy let's Roll
Mano esse Kara é simplesmente inssano não tinha escutado ele descobri através de Alex warren
🎉
This man can’t write a bad song what a guy
Yes. 🎉
Is that Theodore Chipmunk u know the fat one 😂😂😂 this generational country music sucks ass!!
Heard this on my country station: the song's lyrics were originally intended for a movie that ultimately did not use it. Crazy! Cause I can play this song on loop🤷🏾‍♀️Nevermind I’m old and drive a 2500 RAM and blast it as loud as I can😆
great song man keep going
⚡️🙏🏼🥁
I thought the music video would take place in the wild west and involve horses. 1812/3846
DON’T WORRY WHERE HE’S BEEN, HE’S BACK IN THE SADDLE AGAIN!🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
Blatant Aerosmith rip off
Dale Sr quote in there
Trying to play golf when this was filming lol.....nah we used to the noise.   Literally 200' from the green is this track.   Haha
Hi luke! Kane Brown and his wife can't make a living making music, because their voice is not marketable.  Kane Brown sounds worse than 7 years ago when he sang a song "Saturday night" on CMA awards.  Everybody hated his performance.  Khalid should get fired too. Don't collaborate with Kane Brown.,
Does this guy make a bad song? Seriously.
Can you please send me the an,t no love in

Talking about being awake.
Sounds a little like The Midnight Rider by the Allman Brothers
Never clicked off a song faster, thought this was an Aerosmith cover
Movie song
Luke...LFG!!!
Back in the saddle,  They put me away I was idle, then Luke Combs gave it a title!!!!  He's does this song rustically refined!!!
Good job Luke Combs ❤
I reckon this song I wrote for Luke to sing would suit his voice perfectly https://youtu.be/2mlR-LTjCuE?si=rb3Euxf_4oue9Yc2
So Sad , No Body Knows How To Sing Country Music Anymore.
Crap
There's something so familiar about this riff and vocal melody, yet it's still remains new and refreshing for the genre.  GO LUKE!!
what a pretty smile, Luke 😍
This is fire love your music luke 😆❤

Great video and intense with Dale but as a cowboy with the lyrics a little rodeo wouldn’t have hurt or second video focused on being back in the saddle as a cowboy
Wtf is this shi
This song is not the same without that Engine Roaring in the background, it's an awesome song but this video is the icing on the cake.
That is not Luke combs
🎉 love it
This is such a great song…. Its not the video I was hoping for tho  Where’s the damn saddle?!? 😂 I was thinking you’d be a 🤠

Do you need any help like love spell to bring your ex back, win case in court, ex wife back, ex husband back, pregnancy spell, sickness spell (cure to any sickness), lottery spell, marriage spell, goodluck spell, break a curse, protection spell, take full control of your partner, etc or do you want to be the best in all you do - lay your complain let me help you?…~

Darn tooting I loved this song, but after watching  the video I blown away! Luke, you're a man's man ❤ I just adore ❤ you ❤

God's eternal love is Christ's Sacrifice for all of us.  We, as being in the flesh / sin, will have eternal life into spiritual bodies having faith - belief in Jesus Christ we are covered in the flesh and are forgiven by repentance of OUR sins by the Sacrificed lamb of God. Have this claim? Be sure to cling to it these last days. (It is the oil in our lamps). If not, you should consider doing so. By belief - faith we have grace, mercy, peace with God through Jesus Christ and rejoice in hope of the glory of God and not ashamed as the love of God is in our hearts by the Holy Spirit. Being in the flesh / sin, Christ sacrificed for us and being justified by his blood we shall be saved from (God's Wrath) and joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, that as Sin / Flesh brings us unto death instead grace wins through Jesus Christ righteousness unto eternal life. Confess that Jesus is Lord and believe that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Our Father God through Christ gives generously eternal life to all who call on him. Wherever you are (HUMILITY) in your Soul claim, ((Christ as your savior)). The Holy Spirit knows your internal seal for the harvesting angels to recognize when Christ returns. (Share This Truth)

The best country singer: Luke Combs. The worst country singer: Kane Brown.  Kane Brown is a joke.   Kane Brown and his woman can't make a living making music.  His voice is lame.  He's not even qualified to be a singer.  Even 4 years old toddlers can sing way better than him and his old woman. Their collaborations sound very bad.
I wonder what Luke Combs would think of this song:  https://youtu.be/9GuYF3bg1_Q?si=2Rt5T-n7rGBDOO0e
you guys better fucking believe it. It was only a matter of time, but just watch rock and country will collide.
Kane Brown and Khalid have to go. They both can't sing.  Even my 2 year old son can sing way better than them.
Good luke🎉
Your my hero
John Madden football has put me on to some fine tunes over the years music 🎶
why does this song remind me of lightning McQueen
I play this on my way to work and I suddenly turn into a nascar driver on the highway😂
Great song and video love it
i sing all of you songs and my mom is inprest
This could be one of the coolest song ever form Luke combs I mean you got Dale Earnhardt Jr and Richard petty like this is just amazing and Luke combs is always amazing.ka,-chow 😊🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

I was in the grave like Lazarus, but I gave my life to Jesus and he ressurected me!! Im 65, wife passed, never had a family but God aligned me with someone that does and we're crazy in Love!! That's what my God can do. Didn't happen overnight but if we endure and keep the faith we will get back in the saddle again like an old cowboy, so yes this song really resonates unspeakable joy to me and "It's all because of Jesus!!!! PRAISE  GOD!!!!!
badass
I've received a badge for top listener for September And October 2025!!! Keep Em' Coming #Luke 🎙️🎶🎶 🎸🎸💯💪🏾🫡

Only thing that could make this video better is if it was shot at the freedom factory
Love this song 🎧
Thank you for sharing this useful tutorial.

june BUG!
I just love how they use Dale senior’s number on that race car and with how junior got into it and  how the king of NASCAR Richard Petty was in it too so let’s race y’all
2025
❤😊
You know ol Dale Sr is loving this tune from above. CARS Tour is bringing back Golden Era stock car racing. Combs bringing that golden era country music.
Fan frickin-tastic. I love this so much!
Kane Brown and Khalid are country music destroyers. They should have been terminated a decade ago.  They both sucks at singing
Dale Jr wishes he was as good as king and Dale Sr
MUITO FODA
Do you barrel race
Ok so
THE KING!!!!  He showed'er how it's done!!!  The man the myth the legend. Richard Petty
Great song
Carolina all up in this here video
Well… I’m happy because I’m hoping he plays this because I’m literally seeing him in three days I’m literally in vacation in Maryland Ocean City because he’s playing in Maryland Ocean City at the beach on Sunday I literally just have to wait till Sunday and do the other concerts😂❤❤
Wow I always thought the guitar in this song was way more complicated than it is. Now that ive listened closer, I think that twang riff deserves to be louder and more involved. Its got the bones, just needs a little makeup 💄 ✨️

Aint a Combs song I dont like!
This is the perfect song for Dale Jr's return to the 8 (Edit) Just finished. PEAK
I go to this race track my cousin race is here and I actually got to meet him after this. He signed the whole entire race track with Dale Earnhardt and whatever and this is in Hickory, North Carolina.
This is a great song
I won’t lie; when I saw the hand grip the fence, I thought it was Dale Sr. Watching his boy…
THIS IS THE THE DEFINITION OF THE WORD: HELLYEAH
Earnhardt Jr has got me in that saddle 😉
Too bad he sold his soul to music row. IYKYK
this song is peak and fires me up to race!
One of the best songs iv'e heard in a long time

Luke. Is. Back.
Yeeees! Could even be a badass heavy rock song. 👏👏👏
R I P
Lauren Alaina wears tons of make-up, but she's still ogly.  Just ogly. She can't make any money from singing.  She will always be remembered as an American Idol loser
Love this!!
great song
That track was extremely crispy
Friendly reminder to my fellow MAGAs that Luke Combs is a liberal!!!
All I can say is that joker can SING!!!!!
Wish Jr was back in the saddle again ❤
LOVE THIS SONG IT MAKES ME WANT TO RIDE A HORSE AND ROB A CARRIAGE
Awsome song
Only thing that could have made this better was if it came out when JR revealed the return of the Bud 8 last winter and they debuted it using this music video.
First time I heard this, I thought it was Mick Jagger singing...
man this is fucking badass
Love it!!!!!
I LOVE THIS SONG!!! KEEP IT COMING!!!
You did it yet again!! I’ll have to come check you out when you you this way. Been a fan since I stumbled upon “ can I get an outlaw” !!! U da man
L!!!! F!!!! G!!!!
I think if Sr was still alive I think the kings part would have been Dale Sr
This would make a great movie. The driver is gorgeous 😍
Awesome music videos are back baby!!!
“I didn’t realize how much I needed to hear this until now.”
This is a big hell yea brother, doin it for dale always
“Luke Combs always keeps it real—‘Back in the Saddle’ is pure country energy with heart and grit. This one’s an instant classic!” 🎶🙌
I love it I is so good you are the best singer I the world
this makes me miss my zl1 man fk
Madden NFL 26
This is my shii.... NC jamming out ❤❤❤
Cool video music 🎶 like
You’re damn right about being back in the saddle again Luke!
Would be a good song for a new #daysofthunder movie💁🏻‍♂️🙏🏻
Like videos music 🎵 cool
Not much to say, except, FRIGGIN AWESOME l!!!!! ❤
Great to see Jr driving again if only in a video with the king and Luke  Great song even better video
Junior is back. Luke is bringin it🤘🏼
Nearly a decade out of the cup series and Dale Jr’s still got it

Uh new Nascar title song please, it's so good! absolute banger.
love this such a great song and singer
i rarely listen to country music but ts is SO peak 🥹✌🏽🔥
It’s in Madden26
Who is a better country singer Luke Combs or Morgan Wallen?  Questionable.   Kane Brown is a disgrace to country music. The worst garbage country singer?  Kane Brown.  He can't sing songs in tune: always off key and out of tune. His concert was always a total flop: people throw rocks at him for being a really silly singer.   Poor man.
Fitting that Dale Jr. just acquired the trademark for his “8” font
Cool video music like 🎶💛🐺🐾
Let ME show you how it's done!❤  I love Luke 4ever❤ Esster egg🎉
To everyone reading this: we don’t know each other and maybe never will, but I truly wish you nothing but happiness and all the luck life has to offer. ❤💖💓
Like videos music 🎶 cool
He's BACK!
Raise hell and...
Another fire song by Luke Combs 💥
This music video matches the song perfectly.
This guy just doesn’t miss. I’m convinced he can legitimately sing anything and turn it into a hit.
Crazy could you Translat me in Englisch or German please !!I am from Austria 🇦🇹🇦🇹🦋🌍🌎☎️
That ol 8 car brings me back to when i was a child 🥰
sup.
KEEP SHINING❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yee yee!!! Glad your back brotha! Keep making bangers!!
This song didn't make it to the NASCAR 25 soundtrack! 😭💔
Madden 26 ??
I don't own fakes, but I can certainly understand why people would buy fakes, especially now that prices are rising and there are more and more quality issues with authentic bags. When my patience runs out, I will also go to   kisluxs   to shop what I like bag.
The details were so close to IP that i was concerned it would be copyright struck. This is gta5 levels of skirting.
I need a comeback so good luke!!!!
love this song!!!
Madden 26 yupp
Those cars look way better then cup cars...theyre sweet
Is this some kind of teaser
Cool video music 🎵 like
Another GREAT song by Luke Combs.  LOVE the video
Me when NASCAR 25 drops
Like his songs
Junior comes back I’ll start watching again!!! Richard childres and junior motorsporst together and let him get back that number 8.
Are you the one who steals others tiktok accounts??
Kane Brown cannot sing. Even my 1 year old son can sing way better than him. haaaaaaaaaaaa Seriously, his music sucks.  He tried to a have better life from singing but unfortunately, his voice is not listenable.
:45 I'm liking it. Groovin now,82025
1 verse and the chorus 3 times. This song is trash. It is absolute garbage. Buy his merch. Buy his stupid hats.
The world may be ending, but at least we get moments like this boys, Jr, the king, Luke, AT DAYTONA
This one went wayyyyyy past the ball field......
Me and my nephew cannot wait for the Madden 26 soundtrack to come around!
That car is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 he's coming boys
Intimidator 2. Go get em Jr......

GO Chevy or go home !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,   #3,  yeah    #8.      Love you Dales.  👍👍👍👍👍👍
not real country fake studio crap
Anyone else think this sounds like butt-rock with a twang?  Because it sounds like butt-rock with a twang.
This is absolute dogshit. None of the words or verses rhyme. He's just yelling random phrases out of sync with the music.
I hope this is going to be in a movie it looks off tap to be just a music video
The SICKEST music video ever 🔥🔥
Love you, Luke!
You can just see in the face and hear in the voice.. "I'm mad as hell and ain't gonna take it anymore!!"
Should send this in days of thunder 2
Will be the anthem at a many a hunting clubs and many a bonfires 2025 Seasons!! 😎😎
I’m obsessed. I heard this on the radio and I can’t stop listening to it. Luke Combs, once again, shows why he’s one of the best modern country artists.
Here after Austin Dillon won the 2025 Richmond race
Petty,Pearson,Yarboroughs,, Jr.Johnson, and Allison’s. Damned dude. Great song. I really miss those good ole’ boys. . Thanks
Absolute Cinema ✋😐🤚

Ooooohhhh this shit is really fuckin good 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fell of bc he a Biden supporter
Thanks Luke and whoever else involved in the writing. Heard this for the 1st time right after my 1 year of sobriety. The rest of you have to find something else. This is my song! Jk.  Love and peace. 🤙
Put this in nascar 2025
You are my favorite!!
Melhor achado de 2025 🇧🇷
Piss poor cidws on a badass aong
I may be biased as a big fan, but this is the best "I'm back, bitch!" song I've heard in quite a while!
Who’s here from Madden?
Madden 26 anybody?
It's perfect. 👍
Seeing Jr in the ol #8 gets me so hyped
Totally Love  It
He is just amazing 🤩
Luke this is badass

Cars 4 theme?
This is my walk up song in baseball
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What a combo! Luke, Dale Jr, and the King! That matte black with the number 8 is so sick looking 🔥🤙
Number 8 is back in the saddle again
I lost my job 3 months ago and I thought I would never get a better job but I finally got one and this song perfect fits how I feel right now!
BRO!! I've legit sung the national Anthem at this track!! It's on my channel!
We would've had 3 legends in one video  if Dale Earnhardt Sr was still around
Wow this is amazing song!!
Good uplifting song
Love it so beautiful ❤
Waylon is smiling
All my toddler wants to listen to. Rides around on his bike holding a cup of milk like Luke holds his beer.
Gotta give it a like for being in North Carolina! I immediately recognized that race track  - between him and DaBaby I'm always recognizing somewhere lol.
If this isnt in world of outlaws im sueing
I've been gone for a little too long I've been waitin' on the drummer to kick off a comeback song I've been waitin' in the wings like a dog on a chain  I can feel this fire building up a little wild in it Went and checked the wire, sure enough there's live in it Try to stop it but I can't, it's callin' my name  ‘Cause I'm back in the saddle like some old cowboy Who dug his way out of his grave Pulled up his boots, put his pistol on his hip Climbed up and took hold of the reins Don't worry where I've been I'm back in the saddle again  This time I'm takin' what's mine Like a long lost out west outlaw outta his mind I'm ridin' into town, no turnin' back now  ‘Cause I'm back in the saddle like some old cowboy Who dug his way out of his grave Pulled up his boots, put his pistol on his hip Climbed up and took hold of the reins Don't worry where I've been I'm back in the saddle again  ‘Cause I'm back in the saddle like some old cowboy Who dug his way out of his grave Pulled up his boots, put his pistol on his hip Climbed up and took hold of the reins Don't worry where I've been I'm back in the saddle again  Don't worry where I've been I'm back in the saddle again  Tekst pochodzi z https://www.tekstowo.pl/piosenka,luke_combs,back_in_the_saddle.html
This got my di*k hard. Ohh I'm all woman born a woman, but this gave me chills HOT 🔥  DAMN!!
As a guy who lives outside the US, I say that I feel american just by listening to this song! 🇺🇲
Justin Allgaier ftw

Came for the thumbnail, stayed for the vibes
Well done Luke and Crew.

Our hometown track! Dale looks like he's going super fast....but....the tracks so small now way hes topped 50mph max hahaha
Good long
me encanta la música country🤠 saludos desde Argentina 🇦🇷
Another " drinking song"!!!! Awesome!!!
Aww great I’m a Puerto Rican gone country ahh oh well 😊
Another one out of the park 🏁
Would’ve been awesome if Luke actually covered the Aerosmith song of the same name.

2:15
Yeah boyyyyyyyy!!!!!!

Nice Luke  nice and gritty like when I got into your music I’m a 70’s 80’s rocker
@lukecombs - Great Song!!! Plus 3 NC LEGENDS!!! Luke, The King and Jr! NC FINEST!!! Luke your golf Video with Grant was Awesome!! If you are ever in the Wilmington/Carolina Beach NC area … holla - we will play a round of golf! ⛳️
Love this song Luke. Love it ❤

To Not have This Song in NASCAR 25 would be a HUGE Mistake!
#LukeCombs he’s back in the saddle again
The reflection of Jr.'s car in Petty's sunglasses gave me chills. 💯
We all know the intimidator has this on repeat upstairs. Long live Jr. , the King and forever Mr. Restrictor plate 🫡
Tri county hell yeah brother
Damn!! I was just there with my boy 2 weeks ago watching them practice having just bought a T&W trailer
holy gas
U ready 👑👌
❤❤ Luke Combs
And i thought the lyric video on its own was good, this is awesome, love the song
Sounds good! Song sounds 😎 cool. Luke's voice is AWESOME 😊
Bad ass song and video 🔥
If this isn’t the opening song for NASCAR ‘25 as it’s clearly shows it’s meant for a comeback 👏🏻
Love it, I listen to dirty mo media weekly, this was a very nice surprise.... He never said anything
Reply "yes I was" if you listened to this in July 2025
Bad ass!!!
I have lots of memories here.  Would have been awesome if he had filled the stands with locals.
At first I was skeptical. After hearing it 3 or 4 more times on the radio... I'm hooked. What a song
I just don't like this dude and his voice, did see him on grants golf channel and he is swinging golf clubs pretty nice.
Loved your video with GH brother!!!!
🔥
I new here making my music. Luke is awesome

I only listened to this song twice and it's has been stuck in my head!!!! This song I should say is AMAZING!!!!!
Love this! 🤠
Can we all agree this creator deserves more recognition
Good thing the old man is resting in heaven. That would have been him an not Richard petty let me tell ya
I've been a Dale Jr fan for a long time since I was 12 years old I can remember going to his shop
The black No8. IYKYK
Awesome new raceday song!!
Luke we know u been with diddy every shitty artist  admitted to it u have no talent u re did a black women's song and diddy told ya to do the Tracy Chapman cover thats more offensive than ur upchurch video where Ellen hes not in this video
Hey brother, you should redo the Metallica unforgiven song with a country twist that would be bad ass
Its funny, i was at daytona when dale died, i was at daytona when dale jr won aftet...  i lost intrest in nascar for years.  But if ur not going to be 8, 9 is next lol... chase is the next super star until cleatus makes it.  Do it for dale... amen...
Mr. Combs , If you are reading this please let me hear your version of "the world ain't slowing down" before I die.
grate job love it
2025 🇺🇲🇧🇷
Just 3 North Carolina boys having a good time
I'm back in the saddle again I'm baaaaaack!! Aerosmith
Luke said it was a song made for a movie but they end but not choosing it, for me its clear that i was for F1 the Movie, it has the same vibes as 'Bad as I Used to Be' from Chris Stapleton. Two great songs
Masterpiece as usual 🔥🔥🔥
Luke can you help me make a song
Luke Combs sings about Jr It is so cool  😎 great song.God bless
Cool song 🎶 love it 🥰 ❤
Came for Dale jr stayed for the song!
Of all people you pick the laziest guy ? Dale Jr???? Why not JG ? or even Noah Gragson
we are in the best timeline
I commented on another video saying need to see Jr in a suit with helmet in hand and have him pull the cover off the racing car and wow, just found this one. Not sure what the other video is for if they did this one. ❤️🤷🏼‍♂️
The GOAT is a back
This is terrible.
When I seen those cloves. I knew right off who was in that race car.
👉☝️👆
Dale Jr!   Hell Ya Brother. Do it for Dale 👍
Damn this is definitly my new favorite video.
Aweasome Luke Love NASCAR on weekends and Dale and Richard petty!! Kevin Harvick! Others!!!!!
The best country singer: Luke Combs. The worst country singer: Kane Brown.  Kane Brown is a joke.   Kane Brown and his woman can't make a living making music.  His voice is lame.  He's not even qualified to be a singer.  Even 4 years old toddlers can sing way better than him and his old woman. Their collaborations sound very bad.
I love your new song Luke it is great. Love you more my darling sexy sugar boy ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉❤❤
Dale Jr really doesn't make sense because the song wasn't made for him. Great song for those of us ready to rumble again !
If this song isn't on the Nascar 25 soundtrack, they failed us...
NASCAR 25 RAGHHHHHH WE ARE SO CLOSE
Great song
why am I emotional after watching that :( I loved it :)
Put this in NASCAR heat 5 and the next NASCAR heat game
Need to work on those lip syncing skills a little. But JR & The King make the video!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥we need more please want to use by beat next time?
We need more songs like this combs❤ very good
Bbb😢😢😮😮😅😅😊😢😢🎉🎉🎉🎉
💯 1:26 Y'all heard him right! "This time I'm takn what's mine!" I read ALL between the lines. LuvussumLuke ❤
They should put this song in the upcoming Days Of Thunder sequel whenever they do decide to make it.
Luke, what a diamond. Brilliant and it has been years since a song has made me feel like this, well done sir - you are a modern day hero in my book
I feel like this will be in Nascar25
Been way to long. Great song/video🎉❤🎉
Awesome!!!!!!! Dale Jr. back in the saddle again.   The King, still kickin' it.....    AND Luke Combs !!!!!!!! Good ole Boys
"RETURNED WITH A VENGEANCE!!"💕
Outstanding Luke! And JR and the King put it over the top
I’ve never gotten excited for a music video but this one I did. And it works so well with Jr back in a car with the Bud 8 font.
I am not interested in chatting with ogly humans like Lauren Alaina or her mother or her cousin or her passed away dad.   I chat with real singers/celebrities.  Not some ogly hillbilly from Georgia especially they engaged in INCEST.  Lauren Alaina kept asking/bothering Chase Mathew and Corey Kent to have collaboration with her?  Laughable.  She will never get into music industry because of her looks and behavior.  😅😅She bullied and ruined many past American Idol winners' music career by posting nasty comments in their music videos.  She tried to bully Carrie Underwood too.  Carry Underwood was very lucky, because I caught her doing it on Utube.,//

This is a good song. However, Kane Brown's music career is finally over.  You don't see him anymore at CMA awards anymore. It's a done deal.  Don't collaborate with Kane Brown.  Well, he did his best, but his voice was not good enough to be a country singer.  Nope.  He can't sing like Luke Combs.   I can find better singers in downtown LA.   Kane Brown's collaboration with his wife is total flop.  🤣🤣.....
It’s amazing how Luke never disappoints! The best country is from him🏜️
I’m gonna tell my kids this is the national anthem.
from back in the saddle nascar 21 to back in the saddle luke combs 25 i can say we made it
Luke you need to figure out how to get this song in days of thunder 2
would have neat to see you driving your old mans #3 you bought
i'd like to think that 1:28 is a fuck you to Teresa
Yes
Would love to see Dale race again!!!
I really think Luke combs can sing any kind of song. Love this
Hi luke! Kane Brown and his wife can't make a living making music, because their voice is not marketable.  Kane Brown sounds worse than 7 years ago when he sang a song "Saturday night" on CMA awards.  Everybody hated his performance.  Khalid should get fired too. Don't collaborate with Kane Brown.
Remember guys!  Days of thunder 2 is happening.
Hello, Humans  On Earth there are alot of traps. Keep your mind strong, and you won't fall for any of the dumb human traps.  TERRANCE OUT
Wow! You don't get any better with Combs, Jr., & Petty. Great song & video
Your my favorite singer!!!!!!!!
💪🟠
2025 anyone??
And cheryl crow should do a collab with luke mashing this together would be fire imagine the song real gone and back in the saddle would it be good or bad??????
If they make smokey and the bandit 4 luke combs and jelly roll should make a song about it KEEP IT UP LUKE!!! AND I LOVE UR TWISTERS SONG! 🤠
You are my one and only favorite YouTuber. I never miss a single video from you.😊😊😊
First Ed Sheeran makes a Rock banger for F1, now Luke Combs makes one for NASCAR not even a month later?!  This is the year of racing songs and I LOVE it!🤩🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I listen to the first 30 seconds and knew it was a banger
The best for NASCAR
I agree got to be in NASCAR this year
The Dale Earnhardt quote... we see you legend. I hope you're tearin' it up, up there ❤
I just kept repeating this song 16 times😂
DOIT FOR DALE!!
Another badass country song to add to the list, awsome job.
Fast cars✅️ Earnhardt✅️ Country music✅️ We raisin' hell and praisin' Dale with this one boys
Awesome thanks
Good looking race car
Love the video the end was awesome
God we need to see that 8 car more 😢
Awesome video done at my local track! Great way to put us on the map
#8 love you brother no body was bad ass like that!! Cool bro😢
Your a country artist and you still don't have the best "Back in the Saddle" some fruity little rock band with some ugly broad for a singer has the best "Back in the Saddle." Granted nowadays country artists are the fruit baskets of the music world
Lauren Alaina wears tons of make-up, but she's still ogly.  Just ogly. She can't make any money from singing.  She will always be remembered as an American Idol loser

Miles away from the quality of Chris Stapleton, this nasal twangy tone is everything that is poor about C&W
Strong song and good words as well.
Hell of a song to comeback with  fuck yeah
Remember folks dale may have been the face of nascar but Richard petty is the king
And the racing me and my dad love world of outlaws dirt racing
I love the song

Damn this is good!!
Kane Brown cannot sing. Even my 1 year old son can sing way better than him. haaaaaaaaaaaa Seriously, his music sucks.  He tried to a have better life from singing but unfortunately, his voice is not listenable.
I smell another album 👀❤❤
I love it❤
Who is a better country singer Luke Combs or Morgan Wallen? The worst garbage country singer?  Kane Brown.  He can't sing songs in tune: always off key and out of tune. His concert was always a total flop: people throw rocks at him for being a really silly singer.   Poor man.
good song luke
3 legends at a legendary track
Great Aerosmith Back in the Saddle vibe
He got to be faster
I got the ckackit
loved it!!
Amazing ❤️
Im here for dale jr almost as much as luke

Awesome song man love it

If only jr came back one more time!! Song almost hints he’ll race one more 500 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🤞🏼
Badass
After not racing for 17 years, my dad just started racing 4 cylinders at our local track again for the first time 2 weeks ago! This is now his theme song!!!
The amount of happiness I felt seeing Dale jr get in that car with that 8 font. So much joy, and the song fuels that happiness to 11!!
Back in the Saddle is out NOW!
Remember when country music was cool? Pepperidge farm remembers. You ain't no outlaw poser.
There’s no way this won’t be in NASCAR 25 man, Dale Jr is Executive Producer and he’s literally in this video
28 july 2025 attendance
Heck yeah!!! Awesome 😎 video. So cool seeing three Legends!!❤
Obviously when you Have The King, Jr8 And 7uke Combs it's A Trifecta!!!! GREAT JOB! Don't worry where I been...bchsss I'm back...back in the Sadd7e again! 😊
The Dale Sr quote 🙌  ALSO DALE JR AND THE KINGG
Holy smokes, it's Strip Weathers...
Please say happy birthday Luke Combs it’s my birthday in 19 days🎉

Love the video.. DO IT FOR DALE......
☝There’s something so comforting and familiar about this track—it just feels like home. 🏡
this isn’t the best song he’s made …. thats all i’m going to say
Ok cool song…. I absolutely love nascar and Dale Jr!! But this video was kinda dumb…. Just jr running a couple laps and reusing the same shot over and over again while Luke angrily sings at the camera…. Figure they could be more creative.

North Carolina Boys, YeeYee
Do it for Dale!
Lightining McQueens Comeback Song
Video don’t match music, should of gone with PBR and young guns racing with JB Mauney watching , then dedicate video to Lane Frost
🔥🔥🔥🤙🏻
❤❤❤❤
Tell me your awesome without telling me your awesome ( have the king show up on your video)
About the only thing that would get anybody to watch a nascar race again is to bring back Petty or Junior.   Nascar has b-slapped their fanbase and the fans left.
I thought I couldn’t love this song anymore then I saw this video 😍. I was wrong! This one is another home run. ❤❤
This song will get you fired up! Love it
Not gonna lie- I stopped being a luke fan. But this is giving me goosebumps. Seeing Jr. The King. Hearing the roar of that engine- the quote from Sr.  The meaning behind the lyrics- Luke-I approve this message! This needs to be shared to all NASCAR fans   Boogity Boogity Boys- let's go racin' 🏁
WOW!! Love This Song So Much!!❤❤
I grew up going to Tri-County years ago. Love how Dale Jr and The King is in it!!!!!
Dale's Camera angles are so badass for this music video!
🔥🔥🔥🙏👌👌👌👏👏👏👏👏😁
What a track. 😎
come to Adelaide again
2 songs dale jr is mentioned in by 2 different country artists
Thank you Mr. Combs! That was exactly the song that I needed at that time in my life.
Dale Jr the king and the voice to go with it, really make us feel what we used to feel. Miss those days. Let’s go!
99% luke
if this wasnt luke combs and dale jr, id prob never play this song twice honestly
If i dont hear this playing the first time I boot up NASCAR 25 im going to riot
Absolutely loving this can't stop listening.TY

He needs to start a band. He'd have the best band of the decade w the lack of bands.
Dale jr back to cup?!?!  Iykyk
This video is the next 362 days will have 1.5B streams, I just know it! (Hope it actually works!)
I wasn't even a Dale jr. fan growing up. But I'll be damned if seein' the number 8 and some skeleton gloves didn't put a tear in my eye
Luke Combs word of advice. You are in control of your destiny. You want to me Great. Than think great. You have the power with in you. To manifest what's in your soul.  Look up bro. And you can have it all. Don't sweat the the dry season. God loves you. He needs you when you think you can't make it

Paint that thing red and let’s go back to the Bud era
Richard Petty and Dale Jr HELL YA
Fire 🔥 ❤
Richard Petty back in the car??? Yooooo and Dale Jr???
Jnr in a music vid is awesome

Luvvv this song ❤❤❤❤
Awesome song and video
i got chills, that was so good!
SWEEEEEEET!!!🏁🔥
This track is abt 15 to 25 minutes from my house
Cleetus would’ve made a great co star in this vidya
Is it crazy I knew that was Richard Petty by just seeing his hands on the fence?
We need a Dance for this! I'm here for it! I'm getting my Cowboy Boots 👢 ready. Maybe we will see someone dance to this song on DWTS!🤗🤔👍
HE'S SO D*MN HANDSOME 😍
I swear he can't write a bad song. I love all his music
Kane Brown's music career is finally coming to an end.  Even homeless people in downtown Seattle can sing way better than him.  He was booed off stage.   His concerts are atrocious. Every single time!  Poor loser.
Richard Petty always looks soo cool.
News.  Lauren Alaina's family engaged in incest. That's why Lauren Alaina and her cousin look funny and odd looking. 😆😆😆/////////////

Awesome song!
BADASS

Hell yeah
Back in the saddle again between bring Dale Jr back nascar might be fun to watch again! Bringing the King back makes for the ultimate pairing! Like Combs blew this song out of the water and gonna watch it speed 😊down the tracks’

Diet man
Hell yeah brother
Bit off topic, but this would go hard with the Ghoul from fallout show when they hit New Vegas
Everything’s great besides the paint job, that was dull
A Banger!!!
Love the King Cameo
Save our racetracks
Great song. Having Jr and the King in it is awesome! That black #8 is sweet!!!
Doc putting on his old dirt track racers again:
thanks Luke and Jr.
Best track in North Carolina
Ficou incrível. Adoro todos as músicas dele. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Saudações do Brasil.
It’s good might be the new summer hit
Iconic
🔥🔥🔥🔥 raise hell praise dale. Whoever told you to sing let's congratulate them boy
Buena rola rockera
Love this song
I miss Dale Junior racing in nascar and he's back in the saddle again. Great song with  Dale Junior.
DALE YEAH ‼️
A-Frigginmazing 😘🤘‼️ Dale Earnhardt Jr,  Luke Combs & Richard Petty  ‼️🔥🔥🔥
Seeing ol' Jr. Hop in the number 8 car just gave me some real nostalgic goosebumps. Shoulda made the car red though.
❤
Luke constantly produces beautiful songs. But Kane Brown and his old woman (Katelyn Brown), their collaborations are not presentable/listenable.  Well, Kane Brown is a dead horse so stop the flogging. Even my 3 years old son can sing much better than Kane Brown and his woman.  They are in a wrong business.
I love them
If they don't have luke perform this for Nascar it'll be the flop of 2025
❤

Dale Richard and nascar hell yeah
Glad you're back in the sad.I'm glad of that.Because he's gonna be in the hospital.Saddle right beside you believe that cause, I will be back at that smoke shop tomorrow and the next day and the next day and the next day waiting on your m************ to show up now.I gotta get back to the Harbor fest and enjoy myself.But I will be back down there tomorrow.Seeing you all didn't have the balls to come today

With all due respect, I apologize Luke for commenting Kane Brown in your video. Kane Brown is a joke.  I'm so happy I don't see him at CMA awards anymore.   Kane Brown's concert was completely unsuccessful, failed to meet expectations, and likely had a low attendance or negative reception.
You can’t get more badass than Dale Earnhardt Jr. and The King.
Watch it be the main theme song in nascar 25

Bro keep grinding
The facts. Lauren Alaina's cousin Holly died at age of 41.  Why?  Some unknown disease.  Her dad passed away at age of 52.  Why?  Some unknown disease.   Incest/inbreeding can cause a lot of premature babies in Tiger Ridge, Georgia.

Luv Dale Jr. Luv this! Luke Combs is awesome. ❤
Corny.  Same plot done a million times
Dale Earheardt, Jr. AND Richard Petty in the same video? Hell, yeah!
I thought this was going to be a cover of the Gene Autry song. Thankfully it is not.
Does this Mean Jr is coming Bsck to Cup?????
I just cried that was incredible 🔥🔥🔥
One hell of a song and video,great job
I recently been loving listening to Country music, and this is the kind of country music that gets me going! Love from the Philippines <3 <3
❤️👑
This is freaking butt terrible!
I'm calling it now, this is gonna be in NASCAR 25
Awesome song n great way to pay tribute to INTIMIDATOR JR n the KING
I think Luke Combs wrote this song about Dale Earnhardt Jr since Jr is in the video that is just my opinion after watching this music video I am a Luke Combs fan now this is my favorite Luke Combs song
Absolutely mint tune and well needed thank you superstar 💜
❤😊🎉
like like this song luke you did it i wanna be in one of your songs
Brazil🇧🇷
We ALL have to Change our Perspectiv in Amerika completly asap this is the greatest Witchhunt bro i see it the same way the, a Man that stands so behind every woman Black and white or chekkered and I dont mean Baby Fischer. Donald Trump. Support, renew your vowels. Enjoy your morning from the Branx to the Bibel Belt to the Catskills. Yours truly Rosie O'Donell ❤😂
Now this is the Luke combs we need. This one definitely gave me “This one’s for you too” Vibes.🎸🔥
Love ❤❤❤😊
That's one hell of a grandslam Luke!!! Have seen ya 2x. Hope you tour next year again...
Oh soooo good ❤
Another Kickass Song By Luke!, Keep it Coming Brother! 💯🤘🤘
That is cool he is making a comeback. This song is pretty cool as well.
nascar back ehhh???
holy dude… what a song
Is that Dale Jr in the car?
Luke You make this old girl get up and Get Down! Love your voice full of grit!
The King, Dale Jr., and Luke Combs at a local North Carolina bull ring short track that is just like where NASCAR was born...
❤ 🎶 ❤
Luke is a pretty popular guy in country music.  Huh?  He sings well. However, Kane Brown's music career is finally over.  You don't see him anymore at CMA awards that's it. It's a done deal.  Don't collaborate with Kane Brown.  Well, he did his best, but his voice was not good enough to be a country singer.  Nope.  He can't sing like Luke Combs.   I can find better singers in downtown LA.   Kane Brown's collaboration with his wife is total flop.  🤣🤣..
The best country singer: Luke Combs. The worst country singer: Kane Brown.  Kane Brown is a joke.   Kane Brown and his woman can't make a living making music.  His voice is lame.  He's not even qualified to be a singer.  Even 4 years old toddlers can sing way better than him and his old woman. Their collaborations sound very bad.
Great song from Luke Combs- 🔥🔥🔥🍺🍺🍺🙏🙏🙏
Great song! Perfect blend of rock and country. 😊
Make this the NASCAR intro
F-YES
Luke!  You're the man.  A good song.
This.  Man.   Never.   Misses.
My hometown ❤
Badass.
This was so damn cool!!!! What a great video!!!! This will be a classic for many years to come
With all due respect, I apologize Luke for commenting Kane Brown in your video. Kane Brown is a joke.  I'm so happy I don't see him at CMA awards anymore.   Kane Brown's concert was completely unsuccessful, failed to meet expectations, and likely had a low attendance or negative reception.
My dad and I use to go to this track on Friday nights when I was younger. Tri County Motor Speedway
Who is a better country singer Luke Combs or Morgan Wallen? The worst garbage country singer?  Kane Brown.  He can't sing songs in tune: always off key and out of tune.  His concert was always a total flop: people throw rocks at him for being a really silly singer.   Poor man.
And my favorite driver DALE JR????!!!
Luke really doesn’t drop anything but HEAT 🔥
CALDWELL COUNTY APPRECIATION 😩❤️

Luke Combs, Jr., and the King himself, HELL YEA! 🤘🏽🤘🏽
Hope he is Morgan Wallen’s special guest!!
I LOVE how the car is done!! What a wonderful tribute to Dale Sr. ❤ and possibly the fact it was 499 instead of 500.  This is yet another amazing song from Luke Combs!
Yeahhh boy🤠
This is tough I would use it for my high-school football season
Luke Combs, NEVER disappoints!!  every song is awesome!  thank you for helping me get through my day in healthcare with your music
I think the AI car on the track is trashy and lazy. Would have been way better if it was real
bad timing to release a video on ozzy's passing. on god
Love it!! 🙌🏼🔥
Would've been awesome if Dale was driving his dads throwback car
Never gonna hold down an 8.
Hello Luke Combs, I love your song back in the saddle. It is very good. Great job like always. 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😇😇🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇☺️😊☺️😊☺️😊☺️😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Fantastic 🎉
❤❤❤❤
Omg love this!!!❤
Another one from Luke combs never disappoints me
Just trying to find the track
Yeah, if they’d used a Cup car, as mentioned on DJD, it certainly would have fueled the flames that JR was coming back. Great song. Fun video
#GOATED 🐐🔥 this hands down has to be one of the greatest music videos in history!! i mean come on Dale Jr and The KING!!
Jr was right. He made the best choice choosing his late model. If they did make the next gen car work at charlotte it would have been weird cause yeah he’s not getting in that but this is so so perfect

Absolute 🔥🔥

With Dale Jr. this song gives me old school 3 Doors Down vibes, and i love it.
I am not interested in chatting with ogly humans like Lauren Alaina or her mother or her cousin or her passed away dad.   I chat with real singers/celebrities.  Not some ogly hillbilly from Georgia especially they engaged in INCEST.   Lauren Alaina kept asking/bothering Chase Mathew and Corey Kent to have collaboration with her?  Laughable.  She will never get into music industry because of her looks and behavior.  😅😅She bullied and ruined many past American Idol winners' music career by posting nasty comments in their music videos.  She tried to bully Carrie Underwood too.  Carry Underwood was very lucky, because I caught her doing it on Utube
I don’t know a damn thing about NASCAR, but I recognized Jr. and immediately understood what an epic music video this was!!! 🫶🏼❤️🙏🏼
Hard-to- believe that Luke Combs is actually John Candy.

This man doesn't have one bad song!!! They just get better and better!!! I live in race city USA... Mooresville NC

Meh
My guys knows exactly when to hit. Holy shit
Kane Brown is the worst country singer.  Pure garbage collaborations with his woman.  they can't sing. Even my 3 year old son can sing better than Kane Brown and his woman.  Pure garbage collaborations.

Oh hell yeah Luke combs is fuckin talented
The goat is back baby!!!!

Awesome as always!

I demand the local stations to start blasting this
Sweeeeeeet...Big Dog Combs ROCKIN IT!!!
This belongs as the main song when you load into NASCAR 25. Good Lord its badass seeing racing amd country music together
so happy to see Jr. back in racing!
As a Jr fan and a Luke fan, I got chills watching Jr turn laps to this as the chorus hit.  If this doesn't scream Raise Hell Praise Dale, I don't know what does. Plus we always love an appearance from the King
This song hits harder than my ex!
Opening Nascar 25!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
OMG this is Awesome!!! Love it Luke! Another number one and a badass video too!
"AND COUNTRY HAS ARRIVED" AGAIN! ..💪💯..
King hasnt aged in 3 decades, refuse to believe that man is 88 years old
Great music video!!!!

Hell Yeah!!! Dale Jr. Is just fantastic in his role and then the legendary Mr. Petty is going to dang sure show them boys how it’s done for the ultimate finish!!!  Awesome video and it is a pretty good song to!  👍😉
DALE JR AND THE KING!?!?!?! LETS GO!!!!!!!!!!!!
I used to live down the road from Tri-County Speedway. I don't listen to this new country, but I had to check out this video. My cousin's husband races there.
THIS SHIT HEAT MAN
Tri county sucks but I got to admit this is really cool
EPIC！！！！

🙋🏼‍♂️I’m a drummer. If only I’d of known you were waitin on one for your comeback song, I woulda been there, buddy!
Ok man, really!? So f-ing badass! Hits of Midnight Rider w/ Combs og lyrics to it.... Frickin' Jr! The 8! Satin black racecar! The King, Richard Petty! Subtle hints foreshadowing the reveals. Gritty instrumentals! Its making me mental to go haul ass! This vid/song swept both stages,  winning from the pole & got fastest lap right there after unloading fast!!!
One word...BADASS
Only critique it should have been filmed at Wilkesboro.
Wow, I love the energy! 🎉
Bin waiting for you get from under the thumb and stand tall bro we all know you got love heart and soul mate but that song shows you got pride and balls back it up up till now your songs are for when with a woman or with a whiskey but this tune is where you wona go mate sing strong sing truth n sing with testosterone. Years I said you should be more famous but your song ant really hitting the 30 or younger guys mate but this one had bros feeling it this time pal it's one for the average geezer on the street and would be a good time for a drunk scrap to lol
Luke is back and ready to claim what is his!
Not bad I like it
Holy CGI
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Consistently good Country Songs coming out of this Man. Thank God for Luke Combs!
This song has a different energy than anything you've ever recorded, man, congratulations, you're great. 🔥👊🏾🚀

AWESOME 👌 👏 👍 😍 💖 🆒️ ❤🎉😊
Country Canada Classy Surviving Surprising N Succeeding Yezzer 💯👍
SO COOL Can we use this music for our video? Weve raced karts for 5 years and took last year off after our granny passed away, but WERE BACK IN THE SADDLE!!
This would've been perfect for the F1 movie along with Chris Stapleton's song
I could take on the gorilla alone while listening to this
❤❤❤
perfect for cookouts
Got to win music video of the year
Dale Jr!!!!!!
Jesus Christ will save us amen Repent and get saved today amen❤️🙏
Absolutely love this!!!!🔥🔥
Badass Luke! Love your talent!
Repent and trust in Jesus. We all deserve Hell for our sins, such as lying, lusting , coveting and more. We can't save ourselves, but Jesus can save us. He died on the cross to save us for our sins and rose from the grave defeating death and Hell. You must put your faith in him only. He is the only way to Heaven. Repent and trust in Jesus and you'll be saved! Romans 6:23​ John 3:16​ ❤😊
Ain’t no love in Oklahoma, This song, and Morgan Wallens new one need to be in nascar 25
Cars 4 theme song bro
John Candy after Med Bed Treatment.
Maaaan, this is so cool. My two favorite dudes from North Carolina. Luke Combs and Richard Petty
Need this song injected in my veins
My son and i catered 3 meals to them while they were filming #copperpenny
This song is awesome! Time for a good time!
*Another great song by Luke Combs...I do country music as well...Visit my channel and watch some of my videos...SUBSCRIBE+SHARE.Cheers*
Best music video of the year Id say
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👏
nothing more badass for a music video is to have Dale Jr and the King in it
DALE YEAH!!!
I'm back in the saddle
This is the same equivalent of badass to when Dale Sr was in the Honky Tonk Truth Brooks & Dunn music video in the 90's
Luke never fails ❤
Big fan, but not digging this one.
Dale jr is so awesome
LOVE LOVE LOVE this!!!
👊🏻🤠 that is one mean looking car.
LUKE!!!..What an awesome song Brother!!!! Makes me want to get my 6.7 Powerstroke Diesel Turbo out and run WIDE OPEN....ROLLING COAL!!!!
it would been better if it was wrangler car, should make another one
One of your best Songs and videos
Kane Brown is a joke. Kane Brown and his woman can't make a living making music.  His voice is lame.  He's not even qualified to be a singer.  Even 4 years old toddlers can sing way better than him and his old woman. Their collaborations sound very bad.
🏎️ Back in the saddle again 🏎️
Raise Hell, Praise Dale!
Make Nascar great again. Oh wait you can't cause it died back 2001 with Dale Earnhardt 3
Damn that's badass- talkin a certified chart topper Bo
Awesome Luke! ❤
Gotta make a movie just with this song with Dale Jr Richard Petty and old timers racing at some of these old race tracks
Kane Brown is the worst country singer.  Pure garbage collaborations with his woman.  they can't sing. Even my 3 year old son can sing better than Kane Brown and his woman.  Pure garbage collaborations.
Luke. Kane Brown's music career is finally over.  It's a done deal.  Don't collaborate with Kane Brown.   I can find better singers in downtown LA.  Kane can't sing.  His wife can't sing.  their collaboration sounds really dumb.
This song is great and dale Jr makes it even better.. Raising hell and praising Dale baby !!!
Dale ❤
This song would have suited the F1 movie more than Stapleton's, "As bad as I used to be."
Jr said it was gonna be good. It was way better than good!
New Song!
News.  Lauren Alaina's family engaged in incest. That's why Lauren Alaina and her cousin look funny and odd looking. 😆😆😆///////////
Bad ass song, Luke! I'll be jamming this in Lebanon, Tennessee!

I finally got to meet Richard Petty this summer and got a couple of autographs. Love that he walked out after Jr and wanted to take over like the king he is. Really fun video!
I love it!!!! I got chills from start to finish. Did Dale Jr get back in the saddle just for this video or is this song made for him to come out of retirement?
What a great video! The song, the video nascar style, it’s just amazing
HELL YEAH LUKE!!!!
Im a fan of Luke Combs but not this song too loud to rock for me i like country music and this for me isn’t it.

I'm 47yrs old. $73,000 biweekly and I'm retired, this song have inspired me greatly in many ways that I remember my past of how I struggled with many things in life to be where I am today!!!!❤️ Well done Luke
Badass!!
Do it for dale!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
TOP TOP
Shot at our favorite local racetrack! I love this so much!
Love Luke and this song is fire!!
😊😊😊👋🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Luke, you are amazing. This song is very cool!!
If richard really drove the car and jr drove it now that car is infinitely valuable
There're certain things only fossil fuels can do. - the past Charlie Munger
Okay, I can dream…… but what if this song is Jr saying he’s gonna come back to racing full time…. Not in NASCAR, but maybe the cars tour… silly to think? Yeah, I thought so😔
Luke and NASCAR.  They were meant to go together like PB&J!  Song is a banger!
Good man
16 Days until Watkins Glen! Free 🍺 for Mr. Combs
Pretty awesome CARS Tour commercial
Carolina boys, doing what they LOVE at Tri County Speedway.  Great song and video.
Is this at hickory speedway????
This on a road trip would be immaculate
Love it!!!!
Im not about to here Luke Combs sing about Hemi being back in Nascar am i?  Edit: No, im not, but godamn its still a tune....
LOVE IT!!! Two favorites in one Luke and the #8!!!!!🏁🏁🏁
Go JR.!!!!!!! Is that the KING?
The ending gave me chills! Great song and video!
HE’S BAAAAAAACCKKKKK
Damn that car is perfect. Flat black and such a subtle tribute to Sr. that speaks volumes. Jr is a hell of a guy. Nailed it on this one. @DirtyMoMedia
Junebugg!!!!! Let’s fucking go!!
Yeasaaa
Like a tough steak boys, this one's well done
Days of Thunder 2 looks sick. Can’t wait
Absolutely love this one Luke I love NASCAR and having two of the biggest legends in your video is so awesome!!!!
My guy Luke does it again!
O melhor
Perfection!!
Love the music video back story w Jr.
This would have been a perfect song for the new f1 movie.
Heeee Hoh!
THE LEVEL OF BADASSERY IN THIS VIDEO IS INCREDIBLE.
Are you telling us Dale Jr is gonna chase a championship one more time?? He's literally the only thing that could save nascar at this point. Lol
We got a new banger from Luke 👍
Best part is Jr. turned this opportunity into a test session at Tri-County. Can’t take the racer out of him
Jr. Back?
The number 8 car will forever be iconic
JR done good filling those big ass impossible shoes
But next is My Kinda Saturday Night
Awesome song and video at my great home track we run at awesome to see jr and the king there to
This is the soundtrack for Days of Thunder 2.
Already on repeat! Another Luke banger
Another awesome song!! Love it❤️
I was so😢waiting on when you were gonna come back with another song and get back in here and this fits perfect welcome back Luke!
😊
This is truly amazing!!!!!!!🎉
Love your work as a country singer
BAD A$$ 😎 Luke Combs starring Dale Earnhardt Jr. and the King 👑 himself Richard Petty !! 🏁🏁🏁🏁 #lukecombs #DaleJr #EarnhardtJR #richardpetty #backinthesaddle #backinthesaddleagain #guysLetMEshowYouHowItsDone 🏁🏁🏁 Fantastic Video !!
Legoooo
Fantastic song and Luke combs is a amazing songwriter with a great voice 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊.
Does this mean that Dale Earnhardt Jr and the King are coming back to race :D in some form..team or something. These are the vibes i am getting
Does it get any better?! Wooo!
Voice capabilities shining in this one 🔥 As usual, love your music 🎶🩵
Can't wait to see Luke doing this one in concert! 🔥😎😍
JUST AWESOME
And i actually would like to hear this song on nascar 25 and if Pixar ever does a cars 4 i would love to see Luke combs play this song in the movie along with maybe Brad Paisley and Carrie underwood and lady antebellum Keith urban and Chris Stapleton and Kelly Clarkson as well too.😊
Love Luke Combs, but this song isn't very catchy. The comments seem fake
this song sucks
25,000 views, good job brother!
Awesome song! As a kid in the 90s who grew up on NASCAR it’s so cool to see a couple of the greats in this video.
If Pixar ever releases another Cars movie, this better be in the soundtrack!
Another great song and I like what you did in the video had 2 of the greatest do run this sport song reminds me of my cousin we were able to get him back in a car this year after 5 years of being out of it
Love it 🏁🏁
🏁🔥🏁🔥🏁🔥
Ok Luke! Let's get going! I get in the gym and light the fire so it doesnt stop!
❤❤❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love him
Dale Earnhardt Jr. #8 🔥🔥🔥
this is fire🔥🔥
Banger after banger after banger my goat
So much better than his last album. One of the best singers of country music and one of the best songwriters in country music.
Luke combs music video  Brandon  back country music 😍💯💯💯💯🤗💙💙🥰😊😊🥵💚
Don't worry where I've been, I'm back in the saddle again  This is a perfect song for any sport event especially since college football is coming back next month lets go!!!! 🔥🤟🫡✍️
Hey Mr. Combs. Great song. Love all that you do. I was hoping for maybe a small favor. My sister is getting married in October and there is an inside joke that her fiancée loves your music and sorta looks kinda like you. And I was wondering if you could maybe congratulate them or just say hi. Thanks for your consideration.
Awesome…
Best music videos I’ve seen in a while. The fact yall got the king and jr. too…crazyyyy🤘🏼🤘🏼
Interesting little tidbit notice how Dale's late model is blank instead of the red budweiser colors and his wearing a jr motorsports firesuit? That's because luke has a deal with Miller Lite
Luke please please please come back to Ireland. I love you so much ❤
About time ❤❤
Bob
love this
❤❤❤
what a song, what a voice, what a video !
This track is 🔥  L.C is killing it!!  My boy doesn't fail!
His voice sounds soo good on this🔥
Luke ❤🎉
Extremely generic mainstream country sounding this one, nothing special, pretty mid actually.
YES LUKEEEE!!! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
F#@k yeah thats one to kick the day/summer of with ..needed that..bring it on lets go..
🔥🔥🔥
Luck combs is the real goat 🐐
WELL WORTH THE WAIT.. TAKE A BOW MR COMBS👏👏👏👏👏
Where r you watching from 🔥🇰🇪
Holy shit that was Richard?!?!
YEEEEEEEEHHAAAAAAAAAAAW
I haven't seen a Luke Combs song lately that hasn't been a banger. This man has his whole body pointed at the gold mine, not just his finger. I hope he keeps making music for a very long time, just because I know we'll have the best ones coming.
Luke just CANNOT stop hitting. Another MASTERPIECE
Awesome song and filmed at my favorite racetrack ever. Now I'll be playing this song on my way there.  Perfect song for my short drive there lol.
8.40am in the UK and here i am blasting this while doing the washing up.
Love it,,,,,, Thank you Luke, you never disappoint!
Never forget that this "country artist" is afraid to ride horses
ive not stopped spammed the preview of this song, now to none stop spam the whole song! God Damn!
This song is fire definitely the song of the summer
I think I know what I'm gonna listen to in the car
Yesss its finnaly here
Another Banger of a song by Luke Combs
Dale jr 🤙🏻
Do it for Dale.
This is a hit song for Luke Combs hopefully his is working on a new album for everyone to enjoy
What a Comeback Song 🔥🔥🔥 World isn't ready for a Luke Comeback
❤️🏁
🔥🔥🔥Yessss Luke, as a Luke loving country swinging truck racing fan this song is 🔥🔥🔥
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Welcome back, Luke! 🔥
Yes Sir!
This is damm awsom
Sending some love from Mexico !! From Cabo!!!
This would've been perfect on the  F1® movie soundtrack coupled with Ed Sheeran's Drive!
OMG ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Boogedy Boogedy Boogedy let's go racing
It’s excellent
Oh my absolute fuck - this song is as tough and gritty as it comes!

Doing it for Dale
Lil’ preview for the NASCAR 25 soundtrack?
Awesome summer country song.  Another belter Luke
Yo I’ve been waiting for so long for this one to come out you did it again Luke combs
Love Luke but this one isn’t for me.
Jr and the King. Nicely done
This is fire 🔥🎉!!!
❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
DO IT FOR DALE! AND PETTY!
Thanks for sharing this new song with us Luke and keeping us in the "Saddle"
Ok damn, son get it! Guitar solos and some rage
Saludos desde El Salvador. Me encanta tu música 🎵🎶🎸
All hail King Richard. Nice to see Dale Jr bustin the speed limits again.
New favorite right here !!
hell yeah
❤ Love that he chose #8 and Hell of a song. 💯🔥
Everytime luke comb sings, it just makes me wanna pull out a six pack and start vibing in the country side till the sunrise next a camp fire
0:41 its already good
Damn, this is really good
❤ Much love, I love this song. I am definitely back in the saddle and so ready for everything yet to come. Very amazing song great job Luke ❤❤❤❤
Casually drops another wild hit banger! Respect!
Absolute banger 🔥
🔥
PHEW! Now that was smokin hot Luke!  Even better than I was expecting !  That's a 'listen to it 3 or 4 times in a row' song!
Like this comment if you think this song should be the theme song for Daytona 500.
Awesome tune, there is no better way to start a Friday. Hope you’re back in the UK soon, it’s time for you to play Wembley.
👀
I don’t think he makes bad songs! This is too good.
I predict that this was made for NASCAR 25
I'll Describe It As The Daytona 500/ The Indy 500 And Then Motor Speedway That's How I Describe It As. He Had Dale Jr To Come Out And Driving The Racing Car And Then He Waved The Checkered Flag He Said Go Go Go The Racing Car Drove Around Laps The Car Stop He Said Great Job On The Races You Did Good.
Get it right people
Song of Summer 25' 🍻
Off topic but I remember playing NASCAR on my PSP growing up. Was racing a full race and flipped Petty off the track around Lap 200 or so. Will never forget that. Legendary track.
Raise Hell, Praise Dale!
Not bad good size
Love the song Luke hope to see you soon in KC
Been waiting for this all day. Love it 🤘
I remember going to my uncle's house years ago, and I would walk over to the track and look at it. (Rest easy Uncle Clyde) I did get to at least watch one race here back in the 90s. It was an ice breaker race right in the middle of winter.  Awesome to see it being used for a music video. These short tracks need more attention like this.
Can't help but love this! Luke Combs with another home run!
Surely I'm gonna sing this song
Yess, love it! Love Jr and Petty being in it.
Been waiting so long for this
The best EVER
This song is 🔥
Luke Combs + Morgan Wallen + Hardy Let's make it happen!!
The Daytona 500.
🔥🔥🇰🇪
It Makes Me Thinks Of Nascar Racing And The Indy 500.
NASCAR AND LUKE, IT DOESN’T GET BETTER THAN THIS🏁
My Song of the summer right here 😤
LETS GOOOOO
After listen to this on repeat for about 30 minutes I can most confidently say that both my ear drums are blown and my speakers are soon to follow
It's so country 🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬
Ehhh .....
