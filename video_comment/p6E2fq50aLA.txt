I remember saying bye to my childhood bird and I cried so much
I’m crying😢
I am crying I am so so sry
two months ago, we had to give up our precious dog ellie mae. she was 15 years old, older than me, and id known her all my life. no matter how many dogs we had gotten or lost, ellie was always there. she was miniature dachsund- black and tan. she was so sweet and loving, gentle with kids, and happy. until we found out she had liver and kidney failure. we decided to put her down so she wasnt in pain anymore, the appointment was dreaded and a bit overdue. we finally did it, with tears streaming down our faces. we got her ashes a few weeks ago, along with her pawprints, a clip of her hair, and a picture of her eating chocolate just before she was put down

i have to put my dog down in the morning and i can’t get sleep he’s 16 and how do you get prepared?
😢😢😢😢😢😢😭😭😭
😢😢😢😢
I’m crying
Had to do that with 4 of my Cats. Latest one was a few weeks shy of his 19th birthday. It is the hardest thing we pet parents have to do. Bringing them home helps the grief we feel.  My heart goes out to you all, they say time heals but all it really does is reduces the heartache. Our beloved pets live on in our hearts forever.
SO SAD
I have lost my dog and my baby sister but she died in my mums tummy 🥹😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

Omg I’m so sorry guys! I had my family dog die when I was asleep and I was at my grandparents house (the dog was my grandparents so one left and one stayed) and they got her ashes that night and I was so upset in the morning because that dog (her name was velvet) was there since I was born so she watched me grow up.

I love him so much and he’s still in my heart forever he has seizures and everything and his memory went away and he wasn’t normal so he had to go get put down. I love him.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Sorry for the sad news
That’s so heartbreaking
So sad😢
😢😢😢😢
I was in shock and my hart dropped when I released what happened 😢😢😢
I feel bad so sorry guys
❤❤❤😮😢😢😢
for those of u who are confused the dog died and her ashes were in the box that happened to me and i could nt stop crying
In 2024, I had a childhood dog when I was 5 but then when I was 12 he had cancer on his butt. They said it would cost 4K to take it out, and so we save up our money intel one day they said they couldn’t fix it and so the only thing we had to do is to stop his heart which is really heartbreaking. I went to the dog hospital to always tell him that I’m here when he is gone. They feed him some peanut-butter to make him feel better. That time when they stop his heart, my dog went laying on my dad lap saying “goodbye, thanks for taking care of me. I will see you again.” We all started crying of how sad it was. When we went to north Caroline, we went to go see our other dogs that pass and buried him with the other dogs that he didn’t meet. And that day is when I always cry of how I missed him. I hope your dog rip in a grateful home of heaven. ❤😢
My heart dropped when I saw the bag 😢
I’m so sorry you got me crying bc I lost my granny’s dog 2 yrs back and he was just as loving and as sweet as she was

Not sure why this channel constantly tends to focus on one child over the rest. Gotta be wary of content like this.
This was hard for me to watch and typing through tears. My special boy Max is right next to my desk,he was the best dog ever. We sent him over The Rainbow Bridge in 2007. We had him for sixteen of his seventeen years. He was a rescue Border Collie and he rescued us just as much as we rescued him. He is the only one of our many dogs that we had cremated and put in a special box.
I feel so bad for you. I’m a member her. She was a great dog.😢😢😢😢

This is so sad considering the day after this I lost my beautiful chihuahua two the worst dog I’ve ever met😭😭   An Xl bully killed my baby and I miss him so much he died 20.2.25 (uk style date) so we had to put down the xl and everyone was heart broken. We were so excited to get Alfie (chihuahua) a little friend which we were getting anyways and just today we found out that we are getting two chihuahuas and I’m so excited we are getting them in April 28 I think. We aren’t replacing him we were already getting another dog anyways but we just found out we can get another one so 2 dogs.  R.I.P Alfie  2020 26 July - 2025 20 February

I had a pet fish before and my grandma said I was dying. I cried. He was the one I loved the most. It’s OK. I know I lost a lot of pets before but look at me now. I’m great doesn’t matter because what’s in your heart matters most that you love them And I loved my pet fish but she had to die. It’s part of the life cycle. What really matters is what kind of love you had for them before

I remember asking why my mums face changed when she got the call… my grandparents said he laid down in his favourite spot on the patio, I collapsed onto the floor in tears.. my two bestfriends then called me and I was a mess they just played Roblox with me until I stopped crying as much, I hated dragging myself to school the next day :( (R.I.P.

As a pet owner, this has happened to me once, and I 100% agree it is heartbreaking 💔 but now I have another pup and I believe my old pup sent him down to me. He acts the same and barks the same. I am fine now and over it but he is always in my heart. I hope you get better.❤

You guys made me cry😢❤
My dog had big pimpils filled with water and now my Sasha is in a better place
Why is she locked in a box
My last name is jolly to
This made me cry I'm so sorry for your loss
I knew exactly what you were bringing home. Been there done that and it’s grim and also offers some closure once you open it and see it and all. It’s still painful but at least you can find some closure and Sina’s spirit can fly in and out to see her earth side pups and her heaven side pups. For Anna especially and the kids who are really truly sad I hope they can find some peace. Having an dog is so hard and so sweet. Intense in all ways.  Rest in sweet peace with Minnie and Theo sweet Sina. ❤
My friends cat ( also my cat kinda) died today😕

And my dog 11 years she was abused and not feed with arthritis and my mom had rescued her and we put them both down while I was bawling my eyes out my brother was being silly and the surgery of putting her down was expensive enough and it was 200 Australian dollars extra for her ashes it was so unfair and this is making me cry since I don’t have the ashes and my dog and cat knew me since I was a baby
I miss my puppy so much because he passed when he was only four months
Don’t worry my dog died to it was a boy and his name was stitch he was about to turn 15 but he was about to suffer like having a heart attack we all cried because we loved him any time I talk about my dog I cry a lot because he not here that I can see him but he will always be in my heart 😢
My cat died and we got his ashes  😢😢😢
My mom had to put my cat 14 years old found and kept as a kitten

I live in the USA, in Texas, and we chose for our Texas licensed vets to sign off on a burial box for our small dogs at the vet’s office to bury them in our backyards. That’s what my family believed in doing just like when we bury our humans we have lost.
I literally almost cried and sorry for your loss

Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo im crying😢
I think we went to the same one , I hope now you've got her nearer to you , it will make me just a bit easier , when I lost my first dog back in May it was really bad. Since me and my family the year before went on holiday to wales with my dog , oatie, we were hoping that he would make it till August. Sadly he didn't , he was 15 , a staff collie cross. But when we went back to wales in August last , we just got a new puppy and when we were walking her , we found a dog called oatie , which had never happened before. The universe has funny ways of telling us things , but it's very comforting . 🕊❤
I was crying cause I thought like they were bringing her home but actually when i saw the coffin i felt so bad

Reminds me of my puppy. Her name was poppy. Born october 1st 2021 and died  27th December 2021. Yep, she lived 2 months and 26 days! I came home to her dead and cried. I miss her still haven’t got her ashes but when i do i will cry Nd hold them so tight. I wish i never lost her because she was always there for me. For the highs and lows. The walks, the tears, the pain, the laughter. So many memories. Fly high my angel 🕊️ 🕊️ 🕊️. I will be watching you from below and we shall meet again some day….

I’m sorry I’m about to cry for you all but I experienced that but my dogs were I had three. They all went down in a month altogether so two of them were they were brothers and sisters but two of them were older and one of them were younger one of the oldest went down first he was 14 when he went down his name was Twix Home from the vet and then two hours later this said tomorrow can you come to the vet? we need to put him down so have you lost moments with him? Make everyone come round and say goodbye to them he was calm a dog and he was very calm. He was a calm dog and he did not like a lot of noise if there was too much noise, he would bite he would bark and then a week later my other boy dog he was the youngest one he went down on the age of 12. I’m not the same that happened to him. They all had cancer so yes the second one that went down was called AC we used to call him ACA he was calm He loved squirrels walkeds he love them they all had a sign of cancer. One of them had chest cancer. One of them had brain cancer and one of them had heart cancer and then my last one went down three weeks later a month later so we spent our last moments with her made everyone come round we said bye to her. Her name was Marley. We used to call her Marley pickle poo she’s the one that had heart cancer AA had chest cancer and twists heart brain cancer which was the worst that’s why he went down first I understand what you’re going through at the moment it takes at least a year or 2 to recover but if I were you, we after they all went down two months after we just got to a puppy and then we went to look at these six puppies and one was already gone and then someone else came in the same day after us they got another puppy. There’s two boys and girls and I was this little girl called. She didn’t have a name. She came over to me and my dad and then those other one called Zorro and he stayed with my mum and my sister the whole time we were there so we brought the boys dog Zorro and then we changed his name a day later to call him. We called him band it but the thing is match that we named him we brought another puppy and it was a girl and then there was only one more left and my uncle got her and they named her Jesse and then the girl that we got it’s called Indy so we so my uncle ours and then we just went to have a look at the dogs and we all came back with indie and Jesse and Jesse, when she was at the place was called sorry to say but she was called Harriet so they were called Indie bandit and Jesse. They’re brothers and sister, so yes that’s what we went through so if I were you just get a puppy. It makes so much better and then you get a free load more you get feeding four times a day is so nice so how are you? Just do that so cute you can go out in the back garden and let this they get their teeth out when you like pick him up and washing the air with them it was so cute for us and then we grabbed them. This little crate and we slept together every night and the nets were so small they couldn’t even wear colours so it’s so cute my Nan grandad uncle aunt and cousins live in a different house my mum Dad sister and me used to live together in my own house but now it’s in the same house but now it’s me, my sister my brother and my dad and my mum so yeah we love you guys. We understand what we’re going through. We love your videos and we’re still sorry for the little girl who broke her arm so we are so sorry for you. We love you so much okay bye guys bye.
