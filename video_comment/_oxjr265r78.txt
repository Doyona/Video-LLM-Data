Jack black is the worst
OMGosh!! The best Tanner, Jack Black, and Kelly moment in history!! I love everything about this!! Tanner is one of the best people! He is a bright light in this darkening world! Thank you to The Kelly Clarkson Show and Jack Black for making such a special moment for a super special human!!!!
Kind of really awkward, personal space is a thing.
My boy was happy as hell lmao
This brings tears of joy to my eyes. I hope Tanner lives a fantastic and successful life 😊😊
Tears!
TAnner is awesome lol. JAck was trying so hard here lol. ITs hard when someone is in your face like that. JAck is awesome
Kellly seems like the coolest person to have a show like this, Love to see it,

I love Tanner he brings so much joy to the world.
Midge❤
The sweetest, most genuine admiration.
Beautiful !
This is ine if the best TV moments ever
Tanner is so sweet
He’s probably my favorite on that show. They’re all great but there’s something about Tanner that gives me the best energy and vibes possible
Everytime i feel down i watch this clip
Stimming is exhausting.
I love Kelly’s minimalist makeup look. She’s rockin’ it. ❤
Jack exhausted… after hugs 😂❤❤
I love Tanner!!!!!
Thats so Cool! Pure Joy! God Bless Tanner! 😇
Hes so sweet 😭
Man I’d love to have this much energy and excitement about anything, how incredibly sweet. Jack Black is a real one.
Jack is making God so happy... This doesn't seem spiritual... But it so... SOOOO IS
Wholly Wholly... Right? ...oh man thats the Koolist stuff
❤ this is beautiful 😍❤️
Dude I don’t know anything about these people. My mom watches the show and told me to watch it and I clicked on this clip bc it had JB. I’m bawling my eyes out rn. This is just so sweet so wholesome and so beautiful. I’m speechless
Tanners stimming when he was a little boy, all I can see is my 11yr old. My little man does those exact stimming techniques. 😊  Edit…seeing Tanners reaction to Jack got me. 😊😢😊
Digging Jack's shoes. Tanner energy and love is incredible
I thought he was about to start kissing Jack 😂 this was such a sweet moment though. Tanner is a beautiful soul!
Is Tanner doing a PeeWee Herman impersonation?
whoever disliked this needs joy
Tanner including his sister in the group hug IS CERTIFIED GOLD 🤗 ...OMG I'M IN TEARS  !!
The humility and grounded spirit Jack Black has. His aura and just him as a person is so infectious. He’s always been a great person. Another one that was never corrupted by money, greed or fame. The way he just lets Tanner keep hugging him and show how happy he is to meet him, it’s beautiful. Gave me a happy tear 🥲 ❤
I have so much respect for Jack Black now. I know I loved the dude before but wow you're incredible man. The humbleness, treating Tanner. So kind. You rock. And Tanner, you are absolutely awesome!!
This is the kindest, most adorable human and he must be protected at all costs
Jack Black handled that so well.  So happy for Tanner.
He was so excited omg I love it ❤❤❤❤
Heart happy
hahah tanner is so great, would love to be called handsome by him
the yes mam made me instantly love this man im a hyperactive mild autistic and i was raised with yes mam and sir as well he is a gem and a gentleman. amazing soul also jealous you got to meet kelly clarkson she is one of my favorite women in the world and singers. 😂😂
How can you NOT smile?!?! 😊❤
Honestly not many people would have the emotional intelligence to deal with Tanner the way Jack Black did. God bless.
Yikes
I love that he knows the specific age he is going to move. We really love to plan. I’m autistic as well and I told my husband the next town we’re moving to. He was like “maybe” but I already know it will happen for sure, it’s a specific goal now and I will be adamant about it. I even know where the pharmacy and the McDonald’s are there, for when we live there like ten years from now lol
I love this so much.
This was so sweet
Tanner’s parents should be VERY proud of the kind, mannerly, JOYFUL young man they raised. His sincerity is precious and something the world needs more of.
Full on emotions. Holy cheese on a cracker. My gosh this is wholesome.
Omg heart swell!❤
Seeing his brother tearing up just broke me ugh
We need more Tanner's in the world.
Wow Jack Blacks body language said he was seriously annoyed lol 😂 but I'm glad Tanner was so overjoyed
Omg I've never seen the show but he is so sweet!  Have to watch it now! ❤
aww. ❤
I LOVE TANNER ❤️❤️❤️ GO Tanner your smashing goals mate! Be you, be true and stay blessed. 😊
3:54 omg you can tell he was just beyond excited, literally made my tear up
He is so truly and genuinely excited and pure hearted. If all of us were on HIS spectrum, there would be peace and love on earth ❤
I bet Jack was so loved up! He leaned back and like had to drink it in for a minute.
Protect jack black!!!
Im not crying, I'm not crying......ugh , I'm crying
Hope tanner got good breath
Oh my gosh i love you so much Tanner❤
Jack Black meeting Tanner felt like us experiencing Jack Black on a regular... He finally got out energized
So many onions. Tanner is joy personified
Wow Kelly looks great!!!
Man that is so awesome!!!!  I love it
Love how he called Kelly, “yes,ma’am”.
5:48 OMG just thank you all of you for bringing So Much Joy to this man. It brought me Joy to watch him. Thank you so much. 🌻
Omg this is awesome.
STRONG GENETICS LOL
My gods, I love this dude
This guy is an absolute gem 💎 ❤
He’s so handsome & sweet 😫 please protect him 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🫶🏽
Awww he is sooo happy
I love Tanner ❤
Jack Black was on Amy Pohlers podcast and this was a highlight of HIS life too. He got all emotional. It was great.
😭😭
Hope you and your children are finding peace and strength in one another. We love you, Kelly. ❤
This was fantastic. What a joy Tanner is.
🤗
Im so glad Tanner was excited for this but this is incredibly disgusting by the production team. Them thinking of putting a person with autism into a hyper-active EXTREME surprise scenario could have been so much worse. Absolutely disgusting.
I think those few minutes with Tanner were a little exhausting for Jack haha That's a lot of energy comin' at ya but what a wonderful experience for them both and I love Tanner so much
we are not worthy of this guy
Omg "we're busy guys aren't we jack?" And the laugh. Oh my heart ❤
To younger generations: see that run? Do you see him running to this guy? That is genuine excitement and desire to love another human, and this is why we will always love and respect Jack Black
Why am I crying ❤❤❤❤❤
Jack black And Peter Dinklage in A Movie about DND Larping And Friendship
Really really happy for him! And Jack you're one hella of guy! You made that man's day! ❤
1 day of him and JUST Jack together would be a marathon for Jack. The next day wouldn't finish without Jack coming out ALONE of the house THEY were in with "red paint" on his hands.. saying:  "I just.. I just.. c0uldn't tak£ anym0r£".....
Jack black was such a great guy here, a lot of people would have gotten irritated with someone in their face like that, but I understand, it was great all around
I have two autistic babies and this brings me so much joy
Lawd I can’t stop crying 😂
That was the best episode.
I hope everyone understands how difficult that can be for someone not used to it. Crazy respect for Jack black being able to just allow tanner to be free and let that excitement out full blast right up in his grill haha that was awesome
Tanner, eu reagiria da mesma maneira se conhecesse o JB
Jack Black is a national treasure
I wish that jack black surprise me at my house .😂😂😂
I love it when jack black surprised tanner 🎉 it was the best day of his life ❤ 😂
He is so charming 😍
Holy cow why does that poor woman have EIGHTY first graders?!! Even if that's divided into 4 classes, that still must be a big school!
Not to be mean but I couldn't stand somebody all in my face with spit shower's and stinking breath...
I need to learn to be so open, what a lovely family moment. =>
😭😭😭😭
The world needs more Tanners
Damn I love this kid so much
This is the sweetest.
Jack black is literally the most wholesome person and he met his match tanner the collab we needed
I absolutely love this dude and I just saw him on a short 3 seconds ago I stopped the short and searched him and I don’t regret it I need a tanner in my life
Jack Black is the best!
Absolutely incredible!! Love Jack Black and love Tanner just the same!! But let’s also not ignore the pure class that is Kelly Clarkson!!
One thing I noticed is that Jack didn’t let go of that hug until Tanner did. He wasn’t even phased by his energy and his closeness
Jack Black is cool beans 😎🤘
It is unreal how cool this is!
Well now I’m crying in the middle of my launch break, thank you Kelly
his happiness is so contagious, I love Tanner so much😭😭😭
If a jack Russell terrier was a person it be tanber ❤ I love tanner energy
3:12
Imagine how wonderful he would be to spend Christmas with.
One of the happiest clips on the internet.
Dammit this Tanner is so much cooler than me
It annoys me that people talk to him like a baby. Just talk to him in your normal voice. Just talk normal. I know they are trying to be nice and I think it's great she is encouraging him. But one thing I think everyone needs to learn is that they should talk to someone on the spectrum like a normal person.
Wow. This is amazing 💕
His PR team really thought this would be good. I love that he even called Jack fat he’s like we need to hit the gym
A Minecraft Movie Post credits scene
I lovvvvve tanner she's pure joy love and light
Made jack black seem normal lol
I have always loved Jack Black but my already high opinion of him just quadrupled.
Tell me why I ugly cried
This so so pure. My heart! The world needs more love and enthusiasm that Tanner brings!
I like it
Jack is so crazy 😂❤ so special ❤ love Tanner
Kelly is a real one for planning this.
Can we get Tanner on the next Tenacious D record that would be a blast to hear
Why did I just see Jack Black as the most handsome man in the world?? Bawling! This is precious! So happy for Tanner 🙏🌹🙏
Jack was so lucky to meet such an amazing young man! He was actually nice and friendly, too. I guess even a broken clock is right twice a day.
Why am i cryin?!! I'm happy for this dude to meet Jack
I've watched this so many times. Saw it a while ago when it first came out and rewatching now as need to show hubby!
The amount of times I have watched this. This is now a go-to for me. If I'm feeling down about life, or have a need for a boost, this is it. The purity in this interaction cleanses me. There aren't deadlines, or ultimatums, or click-ish behavior. This is just pure human to human love. This fills my life meter up.
Both Tanner and Jack are pure joy.
Tanner is such a cool dude, I wanna be friends with Tanner. 👍🏼
I think maybe we are all on the spectrum and Tanner is just a human with a pure heart🤷🏼‍♂️ Loved this!
I looove Tanner! The sweetest Angel of alll timmmeee😭🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷
Tanner's reaction is me af if I ever got to meet Green Day lmao 😂 but I'm really glad he got to meet his idol
Talk about emotional..geez!
Back at my happy video. Too much sadness in the world.
Been watching sad stuff and needed something happy then boom this pops up.  Can't beat it.
As an Autistic guy a year younger than Tanner, seeing his explosive joy is incredible. I relate to him in that I have monotropic interests aka only a few things I like to think and talk about that I know everything about and go crazy for. If I had that equivalent opportunity with one of my idols I think I’d pass out!
Love this! ❤
I LOVE Tanner! What a beautiful human being! WOW!
Precious! I'm not crying you're crying!! Love you Jack! ❤❤❤❤
Sheer joy!!! Fantastic!
i think the only person who i want to get everything they want in life besides me is Tanner.
Oh my gosh!!! That made me cry!!!
Omg this is so wonderful...tears of joy❤
Damn his sister fine azz hell
Omg I love this!!
Jack Black is so lovable
Was tanner trying to KISS jack black😂 oh lord😅
I love the way Jack dealt with his energy 😭🤍
Awe my heart is melting ❤ And look at his family in the audience crying too ❤
I'm high and watching this video and for the life of me I can't stop feeling like Tanner is just a guy acting mentally disabled 🤣
Good guy!!
Tanner was PUMPED!
So beautiful ❤
Wow , tanner is amazing , I’m so proud of this duder
I love Tanners golden retriever energy 🤣
I went to school with Midge and Tanner! Tanner has always been the sweetest guy you’ll ever meet that wants to hug you.  Midge is also the sweetest person ever, their whole family is like that. Super positive, super sweet, super caring.  So glad to see everyone doing well, this just warms my heart. I haven’t been back to our hometown in years so I had been wondering about everyone (:
I keep coming back to this video when I need a pick me up!
I LOVE TANNER AND I LOOOOOVE JACK BLACK!!!!
Tanner is the sweetest young man on the planet. What a wonderful video. ❤
After hearing jacks black rant about politics, it recently came out the he too is super on the autism spectrum also 🤣🤣
When i die i wanna see jack black running towards me ready to give me a hug
As an autistic person myself this awesome Surprise video, really put a bright happy smile on my face ❤
I love how Tanner is received and how supportive his family seems to be, it makes a huge difference when your family won't accept "no" for you.
Tanner did just ask for Jack’s number, he demanded it! Like a boss!
Makes me happy
THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER!!!!
Wow Kelly looks great, I haven’t seen her for a couple years and she looks way better
Omg! I love them both! How cool is Jack Black? The biggest legend… beautiful energy ♥️
Miss Kelly is the BEST!! If you need a quick pick me up, watch this video :)
If only Tanner knew who Jack Black really serves. Lol
This is one of the many reasons why I think Jack Black is such an awesome human being!!!  I love him!!
Kelly Clarkson looks really fantastic. Beautiful!
Tanner’s sister is hot  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
TANNER IS MY FAVORITE ON THAT SHOW
Did anyone else feel like Tanner was about to kiss Jack? 😂
Love You Tanner and congratulations to your sister
The most incredible thing in this video is the tan on Midge
l have autism myself and watching this made me so happy Jack was So kind and patient with tanner This just Made my day!🥹❤️
OMFG Tannner is the best, so nice Mr Jack Black went and meet him.
Just when I thought I couldn't be MORE butt stupid IN LOVE with Jack Black....I see this video.   Dang it. I've been trying to overcome my crush on my favorite celebrity for yearsssss.   Jack Black is Everything I can hope to find in a future husband.   I'm a weirdo woman in Texas.  So, the people that are smart AND funny AND kind, seem to be fewer and farther between... the older I become.  I love Everything about Jack Black. This is just, oddly, the cherry on top of his awesomeness. 🤘🏼
People say hes disabled, I think he's the more than able. Hes so unapologetically sweet and innocent. I wish I could look at the world the way he does.
🥹💙
I LOVE Tanner and God bless Jack for being so amazing!
The way he calls her miss kelly 🥰 so polite and love his excitement
I mean who doesn't love jack black? 🤣
Tanner is the best!!
Your not exploiting anyone at all 😂
exploiting the austistic now how low
I’m on the autism spectrum and I’m single
Am I the only one who teared up watching this? 😅
My BEST, most FUN TIME on TV all week‼️‼️😍🥰🤣😂🙌🏼🙌🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼Thank you JACK BLACK‼️Love you Kelly‼️💓
All up in Jack's face. Jack is a good, patient man.
I am not crying at 3:45 its my hay fever 😏🥹🥹.
Gotta Love Tanner.🙂👍 Tanner was So excited meeting Cool Jack Black.⭐😂 Jack Black met his match in the high energy level😂  My  first Grown Autistic  Son is Very Hype and Outgoing  too.   2025
Omg this made me tear up
To everyone crying...me too 🥹🥹🥹
Why does Kelly Clarkson look so different?
That was very sweet. My brother is autistic, and seeing this was very special. Jack Black is a lovely guy.
I love how Jack handles this as well as Kelly.
I love this. Tanner is one of my favorite people to watch and seeing this genuine happiness and just general positive outlook his parents must be so proud. I would love to have a friend like Tanner in my life.
I love how Kelly just let Tanner be himself. This was obviously a big moment for him to meet Jack Black and he was clearly overwhelmed. But instead of trying to control the situation or make him sit there an answer questions, she let him have his moment with Jack Black while we all just observed. Some may find it awkward or strange, if you don't understand people on the spectrum but I think it's very sweet to see his excitement. And kudos to Kelly for just letting him express that instead of trying to 'manage' it.
I thought he was gonna make out with him lol
❤melted my heart
That’s awesome! Jack black is such a great person
I need a whole documentary with these 2
I'm a 59 year old man with an autistic grandchild and I'm smiling and crying like a baby :)
This warms my heart! #Tanner4LIFE
This was so pure!! Omg I LOVED this!! 💜
I've never seen anything so pure and sweet in my life.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Omg! How excited Tanner was made me excited and smile through the whole entire video! God bless his little heart! That was the sweetest thing❤️
This Jack Black’s attempts to divert attention away from all the bad press that he’s been getting lately!!!!!!  And people are totally buying that shit!!! A Sexiest with Liberal agenda!!! Gee, sounds like Jack Black should go into politics, he’d do really well & fit in perfectly with all the other sexist crooks
This is the best kind of thing to watch in the morning when you're waiting to go to work. You experience laughter to start your day. You experience just great and overwhelming joy and love for other people and it just warms your heart and it's so good for your soul.    Tanner you're a boss brother. 🫡
He will be happy forever Omg to be his boss. Rick All good feelings😊 I love this Kelly show
That made my week
That was wonderful.
The pure joy in all of this omg, so contagious!!! 😍😍🩷🩷
Watching tanner meet jack was like the best dog meeting its owner when he comes home ❤️ the love and enthusiasm was electric.
My soul needed this. Tanner shines with happiness
Jack handled that amazingly! 👏
3:39 😭  "You're here! You're here!!"❤   I hope to rejoice exactly this way one day. How beautiful
Kelly looks so beautiful
I tear up seeing him so happy 😭❤️
Can we please get this man a role in a pixar movie as a character! Give him free reign to improv some of this characters lines!
Both my son 24 and my daughter 20 are on the spectrum. They’re doing well, are sweet and respectful. They did a great job raising Tanner I’d love to see the show Love on the Spectrum
Oh. I cried at that! WOW! Now that’s the way to have a surprise!
I love this. Sooo wholesome and authentic.  This is why we're here.
I love Tanner!!!! He’s a sweet and beautiful person ❤
Tanner is so sweet, I love his family- I really think he is living his best life and I love that for him. Jack Black is a class act, I think the world of him. Two great humans meeting each other ❤
JOKE'S ON YOU, FOLKS! I WAS already planning on crying today! 🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷
This section comment is giving me life. ❤️ I love all the great words !
That's the greatest ever. Jack Black is a great person to want to meet. So happy for you Tanner!!
Wow. I’m crying on my lunch break.
"You're the best, Miss Kelly!" That's so cute lol
Did someone just calm Jack Black down😂😂😂😂 producers need to hire him in case Jack goes off the rails😂😂😂
Tanner is the sweetest! 😍💜
Yeah man. This is what it is all about. Huge respect for Mr Black for being a good man and being so kind. Absolutely beautiful.
His innocence and kindness is so beautiful and Jack Black being an amazing human as ever and being so kind so beautiful to see
As someone with autism, this is so special. Also ironically my brothers name is Tanner.
When did Kelly Clarkson get so thin wth😭
There is no one out there with more PURE JOY than Jack Black. Also not gonna lie, if I met Jack, I would be out of bounds puppy excited too. ❤
80 first graders. Damn classes are big in us 😂
That was so cool of Jack to do this, and to be able to embrace tanner in his purest form even if he was in his space a lot, they were both just so appreciative of one another.
I cried and laughed. Best feel good moment. Love Tanner. So genuine. So sweet.  Thanks Jack and Kelly as Tanner would say best day
i'm weeping
When you cross humans with golden retrievers ….
oh my gosh what a sweet soul they both are.
I lOVE tanned so much😭💕
Acoustic guy
Tanner is great and wholesome
I know hes acoustic but it still couldnt hurt to teach him that its rude to scream in peoples faces. He needs a lesson on "personal space"
Tanner is awesome!
I think tanner has autism
That was just the most glorious, beautiful, wholesome, gorgeous vid I have seen in years. I cried tears of happiness. Thank you Tanner for being you, the light you bring is like the sun 🥰
The way his sister spin around to smile at Kelly was her telling her “you just made him the happiest man on earth, thank you.”  And I bawled….
Did this make anyone else’s eyes well up or just me?
One of the most wholesome videos omg
I do not like porcupines
Tanner is probably the best human walking the earth.
I love him this is what I feel my dog what be like in human form. So happy and excited to see me and so loving ❤️
What a lovely young man!
No one will ever be happier than tanner meeting his idol- and his whole family crying with an overwhelming sense of love for their precious brother. What an amazing way to live life- always happy- we should all strive to be like him.
This is just so beautiful! We can all learn from this. Autism can be absolutely beautiful. Who are we to Complain and yet he is just as happy can be.
Tanner, I’m here!! Jack, it’s you!!  🥹
Two of my favorite dudes, wow! 🎉
Love this so much!❤
I mean... I get it. Jack Black in School of Rock shaped my entire sense of humor. And as a human he's just a sweetheart.
Yes. Amazing
mean comment
HOORAY FOR TANNER!!!!!!!! CONGRATS!!!!!!!! What a hilarious entrance from Jack Black!
Omg the giant smile on my face during the whole video. Tanner is such a sweetheart. I hope he and Jack Black become friends and workout buddies 😭💖
I love Tanner
I would react the same way to Jack Black...
I want tanner to achieve so many good things. Ive known of him since he was on Special Books by Special Kids :)
I cried laughing but emotional too … what a beautiful feeling of love for others ❤❤❤
I love that Jack has little to no discomfort over personal space.
OMG thats so sweet !!!!! I brought tears to my eyes 🥰🥰🥰🥰
I love stuff like this
This brought me to tears. So many of my family and friends are on the spectrum, he reminds me of one relative in particular with the way he expresses his love and excitement ❤
This is so precious 💖
This is the sweetest thing that I've seen in years.
I would club a seal to be married to Tanner's sister Midge!!!
Idk if Tanner really wants to find a gf or ge just feels like it’s something he is supposed to do.
This entire clip was beautiful and moving. Especially his siblings reactions- just looking on with such pride and genuine excitement for their bro. Omg, I love this so much, bless them all. Also hoping to see an update video of tanner calling jack up and then them working out together
This is so incredibly wholesome all around.
I appreciate that Jack didn't even try to upstage Tanner. He just let him have his moment and was so sweet to him. I'm sure Jack won't be forgetting this moment anytime soon.
Jack laughing is everything . So sweet. ❤❤
Im literally crying
I so needed this light ❤
This was so sweet omg 😊 the way jack was matching his energy and how tanner introduced his sister literally so sweet
Holy cow! I wasn't ready. I'm a bitter old woman but I'm sitting here and my eyes are leaking!
I love him and his sister so much
You can see Tanner's Soul explode in Excitement when Jack ran up. Tanner's Innocence is Everything. (Tears)😎💯💯💯❤
CHICKEN JOCKEY!!!!!!!
Libels are so fake. Can't stand them
Ummm, how do I apply to be best friends with Tanner? Imagine if we all had a friend like him ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I Literally could Not stop smiling!! I've adored Jack Black for years, and this loving meeting with Tanner just makes me love Jack more. I Know they'll be Lifelong friends! 🧡
i don't think i will ever get tired of the way he yells "YEAHH YEAHH YEAHHH"
Oh I love that I love that it's so perfect
Awww bless jack black absolute legend ❤️
Pure Soul
No filter! Absolute pure free love!
❤❤❤
I looooooove Tanner!!!😂
Oh my gosh this is so awesome. What a delight. Cheered me right up haha. I love to see Tanner so thrilled
I’m exhausted just watching him, boys going a mile a minute!  ❤❤
Kelly found Ozempic lol
Omigosh, this just made my day!
His energy is so infectious and wonderful! I wish more people were like this, so real and raw. Genuine excitement.
I don’t know how I missed this, but I’m finally here after learning about it from Amy Poehler's Good Hang podcast, where Jack Black was a guest and they both discussed how touching this whole thing was—and I totally agree. This was beautiful. ❤
australian documentary makers have done an excellent job with love on the spectrum, jack is a big star and hes a great sport meeting a fan with special needs, fantastic!!
That was so sweet to see him so excited
I love that Tanner is so joyful 🥰
I love his energy! It is great to see he is do supported and thriving. More individuals with individual needs should have this!
Jack was like, daamm the energy is real! 😂  So awesome
I love Jack Black! What a good sport.. how happy he made this young man ... great segment
Tanner is a human Border Collie. I mean that in the nicest way possible!
What a beautiful moment. What a beautiful heart everyone there has
Kelly is so damn good looking. She hasn't aged a day since Idol, it is kinda crazy
I love this show on Netflix ❤ i work with people with disabilities and THIS is why I LOVE my job ❤
Tanner is awesome
Tanner’s crush on Jack Black is so incredibly sweet.   He was very confident to ask to switch numbers and go training with Jack!  😊
I searched this video after hearing Jack tear up telling Amy pohler about meeting tanner. This is so beautiful
Please give Frankie and tanner their own show!
This was so moving - Tanner is such a wonderful man, even through his excitement he still introduced his family to Jack and was so polite to 'Miss Kelly'! The way Kelly spoke to him like any other guest, Jack not moving away/being so present, his sister mentioning his ability to keep the attention of 80 first graders, no one redirecting or trying to get him to sit/settle down! - everyone here got a perfect score, what a cool thing to be able to witness.  We love you Tanner!
I genuinely believe that Tanner might be the only person that might get Jack to work out!
Tanner is amazing god bless him and his family and aww he love his job and just because a  man with autism or his voice his amazing. ❤
4:08 he is Sooooo happy !!!❤❤😂😊😊😊😊
So much love and light is spread through Tanner 🤍
This is sooooo beautiful to watch. ❤️❤️❤️. Jack did not disappoint his biggest fan ❤️
We all need more Tanner's in our lives. What a bright shining light. Wow. Love to meet this guy.
Autistic people are better humans in every way.
This is so beautiful. Kudos to Jack and Kelly for treating Tanner with such dignity. He's such a joyful, wonderful human, we need more Tanner's in the world and that he introduced Jack to all his family, oh my heart! Happy tears watching this.
I swear if you are ever famous and some admires you especially someone with any kind of disability you better treat them like they’re better than you!!! ❤❤
These ppl are so blessed
This made me cry… so wholesome and sweet!🥹
Damn Kelly can you spend a little money on wardrobe? All dressed like you’re ready to fold laundry
Bro is living his best life, God bless him 🙏🏻
I remember I have my friend (male), he ever did write a purpose dating letter to girls on dating website, in the way of like you write the Jobs Motivation Letter and very long story to tell and details like CV..😁
I’m dying.  I’ve never had an emotional reaction on this level watching a YouTube video.
Joy level 1,000,000 😭💞💞💞 I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!
Beautiful ❤❤❤
Tanners sister is so frickin beatiful.
What fills me with confidence is that Tanner said he used to flap and freak out so I hope our boy Dylan can express emotions like this ! Taking him to Disneyworld ! He lost his mum 3 years ago and he’s handled it like a pro ❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is the sweetest thing ever. I don’t really care for Jack’s acting but I really respect him. This is amazing. He’s a great man.
Unbridled joy. So many neurodivergent people understand this in ways I think other people don't. I say this as someone with Adhd, I stim and have hyperfixations that keep me enjoying an aspect of life many people are forced to grow out of. People with ASD often share those behaviors.
Oh my goodness, tanner is amazing 🤩
Tanner, you are the coolest!!!!!! This video made me so happy!!
So heartwarming ❤❤❤
It's a lot of love, it's a lot of a heart ❤
I can't see my damn keyboard
Awwww!!!!!
I freaking love this!
So wholesome I love it
a world full of Tanners would get shit done and have fun while doing it
I love Jack black 🥹🥲
tears of joy.
Ive watched this few times over ❤😊
It sounds like he would make a great ambassador for visiting classrooms all over the country. His energy is contagious, what a light.
His heart, bless his heart
His siblings were crying, they were so happy for him to meet his idol. They must really love him ❤
Wow. Im in tears of joy watching Tanner so happy to meet Jack Black. That was so awesome!
They say Tanner has a disability. However, I can't remember the last time I was that happy and excited.    Im starting to feel like maybe I have the disability.     Tanner forever!
If a Golden Retriever was a person! Hahaha. He's such a beautiful sweet guy. He really does spread joy all over the world.
Kelly look like 12 year old Joe Dirt with that haircut
"Come sit down with me and Midge!"  Biggest moment of his life and he couldn't possibly exclude his sister. LOVE IT!!!
He's more golden retriever puppy than a golden retriever puppy
Jack about damn burst. He held it together incredibly in the face of such unabashed positivity.
This is so darn sweet 😂 he's such a sweetheart & so is Jack! He said " ima get your phone number!" Lolol 😂😂😆
Tanner is amazing. We could all stand to learn something from him
now i want to see a movie with jack black and tanner in it lol
This is so freaking kool ❤❤❤ Jack and Tanner! Best thing ever!
That was so awesome!!!!!❤
like a super excited 180# Yellow Lab that LOVES JACK BLACK......God bless you Tanner!
This is so beautiful! 🥹 Thank you, Kelly, and Jack, for supporting people with Autism! Tanner, can’t wait to see more of you and your wonderful family on Love on the Spectrum! Support neurodiversity! ❤🌈
Tanner is such a gentleman!
I'm crying 😭😭 happy tears 😅
You can tell jack black got emotional ❤
Midge-uh so damn fine
Tanner reminds me of Buddy the Elf so sweet 🥺
I LOVE TANNER 😫❤️✨
If you didn't cry or get emotional watching this.. you literally have no soul.  I love Tanner, love Jack, all of them! His happiness and positively is just infectious, I wish more people were like Tanner ❤
We need to protect Jack Black at all costs 😎 ❤
You are also in tears if you know of anyone on the spectrum like Tanner who is sweet and full of life .
Did she say all 80 of her first graders…? Please tell me that’s not one class… that’s insane  I love Tanner and his mum and don’t want to distract from the video but that just make me go wow..  but also massive kudos to Tanner for being able to control 80 kiddos, that’s a hero level effort
Jack and Tanner should do a spinoff reality show called "Black and Tan"
I love Tanner for his honesty, excitement and positivity. Watching Tanner be happy makes me so happy.
You know, there's a great irony in this. Many people misunderstand those with autism as having a "lack of emotion" or being "numb". When you watch Tanner, you can't help but notice he has more joy than anyone. Why does this person overflow with the strongest and rarest emotion on the planet? I'm just saying
Hmmmmm .... I see what your doing jack black lol
I absolutely love this! i love have Jack Black didnt flinch once when  with Tanners energy and him talking so close to him with his excitement. He just let Tanner do his thing. So happy for you Tanner getting your dream to meet Jack you are one awesome guyu Tanner
This is too cute 🥹
This young man is a beautiful soul. His excitement meeting Jack was amazing.
Midge is a smoke 🔥
Awe. So precious ❤🥹
He literally took over the Kelly clarkson show and made jack black seem normal and broke the format of entertainment and forced it to turn into reality tv
So sweet ❤
crying happy tears right now bro
Not saying that anything was wrong with this particular interaction, but I feel like we should normalize being explicit about asking for personal space when we want it, you know? It seemed to me like maybe Jack just wanted a little breather at this meeting, but felt like he couldn't ask for that.  Idk though this is talk show tv. Maybe there was a conversation afterwards. Always sweet to see ordinary people meet their idols though.
Jack Black is the BEST!! Such an amazing human being
my god kelly looks so healthy and good, wow
That was amazing,,, made me smile and cry... love the life your having,, its amazing Tanner.
Oh my gosh this is so sweet.
So cute 😍
I think everyone needs a jack black hug in there life
I still wave my hands about like i did as a kid. Im 32 now. Undiagnosed, no help and my dr's tell me it doesnt matter.   Welcome to nhs scotland
I absolutely Love this interview with Tanner ! Thank you so much Kelly for having Tanner on ! Jack Black is an amazing guy ! Just love all the energy ! I keep watching this video over and over again ! It makes me smile ! ❤❤❤
A soo, I love everything about this ❤😊
He reminds me of my cousin. He's also autistic. The way he speaks is similar to Tanner. He loves to chat with the family, even through WhatsApp. One day, he texted my mum whole day because my mum congratulated him on his b-day in the morning.
Can't stop watching!
I'm crying this is so cute 😭
This is beautiful.  Love me some Tanner!
la reacción de jack a su fan es INFINITO, 😍🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😍
i didn't plan on crying today but here we are
Damn jack black is getting a gut.
Tanner is the best. Im low support needs and i cried because i know that excitement ❤
I love celebrities who take time out of their day to make someone happy.
Is Kelly sitting in a Sabai chair?
Tanner has better manners than anyone! "Thank you Miss Kelly!"isn't he lovely. What a classroom aide he could be! He could really play with children, like really play.
I hope they meet up like Jack promised
Chicken jockey
Omg I love this so much lol
I wanna watch this on a loop when I can't take it anymore. This person is a miracle and I only wish I could watch him grow into his dreams. Fantastic. ❤
Thank you jack gotta go back to just being fun and making jokes, stop talking about politics and all that bullshit just bring smiles and laughter bud.
Tanner is the goat
Okay I thought I loved Jack Black before. Now I’m obsessed. This is incredible ❤️
So they can speak and all. Thought they couldnt do anything
Miss Kelly kills me😂.
A real life buddy the elf 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 I can't describe the love I have for him so pure
Awwwwwwwww
Tanner will remember this forever! 10 minutes for jack, a lifetime for tanner ❤️❤️❤️❤️
What a guy !!
As a mom who has two children with autism this brought tears of joy to me ❤
Kelly looks more beautiful than ever these days. I love everything about this segment. Big fan of Tanner and LOTS.
All up in jacks face the whole time 😂
80 first graders is too many first graders, is that a normal classroom size for that district? How does that work?
Crying 😭 what a beautiful moment
Kelly who?
Jack attack🎉❤
God is good ❤🎉
I just adore Tanner ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
He's the sweetest ❤❤❤
This is such a freakin’ awesome view!
I love this so much!!!!
He makes me feel that life will be ok.
Man, I want 10% of his confidence. I’m scared to even talk to my bosses.
Damn dude has to do a little clean up after threatening the sitting president. Go figure.
This is ALL-TIME
This made me smile the entire time. Tanner is such a sweet guy. For anyone who hasnt seen the Minecraft movie, it was really good!
I have never come across anyone more sincere than Tanner.
We need more business people in the world like Rick. Bravo.
Omg Tanner is a golden retriever
I’m CRYING
The day jack black dies will be a sad sad sad day he is such an iconic celebritiy he’s funny, can act, sing, and he’s an extremely genuine guy considering he’s pretty much an A lister! Love him ❤❤❤
🧡
So adorable. Happy tears.
So beautiful. Jack mate you’re a wonderful human being.
Awwww.. Tanner is just soo sweet ..
Tanner is so beautiful.
LOVE HIM SO MUCH!!!
Omg  3:18 had me crying ❤ the way tanner and jack hugged and were just  so happy to see each other 🥹🥹
I’m bawling my eyes out
Bro if I was his family member I would be BAWLING seeing this amount of joy, god I wish I had autism sometimes. This ain’t a disability. This is a gift. Being that happy effortlessly? Disability my ass. Autism is a gift for so many.
The high fives with his boss was so friggin cute. What a pure soul man. Autistic people are sometimes just the sweetest, cutest balls of joy.
I was so excited for Tanner that I cried. Thank you Mr Jack Black for making one of Tanner's dream come true. Also for receiving so many hugs and not minding them. Jack Black you were great amazing . Tanner you are a beautiful, wonderful human being so much love to give and so polite.
awee 🥲❤
What is his favorite Tenacious D song? I like to think it's 'F her gently.'
It's messed up how these corporate stooges are exploiting these people. It's just insane.
Im not tearing up. Wait yes I am because this was so sweet letting him be himself
This is exactly how my 10 year old son acts. Zero personal space but 100% love. You can't not love him!
Oh my god Tanner is so sweet, he is so excited! ❤
I can't love this any more than i already do!  Tanner is a ball of sunshine and Kelly and Jack were amazing with him.
Tanner has leadership qualities. He really commands every space and with graciousness.
Imagine Tanner just bursts into tears cuz he met him at a different age than 31 lol that’s what my autistic ass would have done 😂
I wish I get to see him😢
Jack Black did so well. So did Tanner lol
I strive to have as much energy and enthusiasm as Tanner! ❤
I thought that was setev name
I am tearing up so hard...I wish the world was more like Tanner and Jack Black is just a beautiful, beautiful soul. ❤❤❤❤❤
This is one of my new favorite encounters ive ever seen. ❤
"We're both busy guys huh Jack HAHAHA" just screaming in his face lmao. This guy is so unapologetically happy.
He’s faking it.
Tanner..what a guy. He has one of the biggest hearts, on our planet earth!
I can't like this enough
this is one of the greatest moments in television!
Thank you Mr Jack Black for not backing away or moving away from Tanner. God Bless you🙏🏼
Somebody tell me they don’t see what I see in jack blacks eyes. Like robin williams. Heath ledger. Matthew Perry
I really hope my son could be as functional as this handsome man… ❤
I cry everytime I watch this 🥹
That was so awesome!!!! Tanner is the best!!!! He blew Jack away from his excitement ❤️😃
Kellyyyy that was so sweet of you! And you too Jack! I so felt the happiness for Tanner. Tanner's my favorite!
Bless you all 🙏❤😀
Thanks to Love on the Spectrum, people really understand autism more. I, personally, am so grateful for that insight.
my heart i can’t stop crying lol this warms my heart so so much my god
Tanner, Jack and Kelly are three amazing people!
Tanner, checking off his goal list is so empowering. What a segment. Loved it. 😊
Jack Black is a fantastic human being.  Period.
I had a brother who was autistic, but much more lower functioning than Tanner. He only lived to 39 though (some hereditary blood disorder that caused leukemia). This made me cry tears of joy seeing Tanner's wish come true. He deserves every good thing in this world.
jack black the greatest human on earth at the moment
Oh gosh well this was just so Wholesome 🥹
"You're a great actor just like me" I knew it!
So inspiring!  Made my day.  What a wonderful young man.  And Jack....nice job!
this is so beautiful!!🤗
wow
Please like this so I can rewatch this when I wanna brighten up HES SO POLITE 😭
aww bless him
I love Tanner - Great Human...so his mom looks like someone right?
Jack was just as happy ad he was. I love this!
Brings tears to my eyes lol
Imagine if his favorite person was Howie Mandel
Humanity still has hope
This interview brought me to tears yet another moment im crying about something from that love on the spectrum show😭😭🥹🥹 so unbelievably good🙌🏽
ahhhhhhhhh ill be crying for days
Awwww Jack Black is so amazing for doing that for Tanner! ❤❤❤
Tanner is freaking awesome! Such a sweetheart and a gentleman too
i will never understand why tanner has not been in a film yet
Someone’s cutting onions in my apartment right now. Fucking magic .
I hate what RFK said about autism. And I love Tanner!
The greatest thing I’ve ever seen ❤
Kelly somehow looks younger than when I last saw her five years ago.
Happy crying!!! I love jack and tanner!! We need this movie
Sooo sweet!! We need more good people like Black Jack ans Tanner
I'm 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭. Thank you Jack!
In a time when it is feeling a bit hopeless and out of control, along comes Tanner. Watching this segment gave me so much joy and brought tears to my eyes. I want to see the world as he sees it; he is the lucky one. All he sees is love and kindness.  This world could use WAY MORE TANNER love.  I will carry this with me and remember that the simplest acts bring us the most meaning.♥♥
Man tanner is so sweet man. Right away he’s introducing Jack to his family it’s so sweet
Truth be told Jack Black is a legend and never in our lifetime will we hear anything negative about him because he lives with genuine intention. I was a community support worker for 10 yrs and for a time, enjoyed being around people with disabilities more than non disabled people for this very reason.  Unlike non disabled people, people with disabilities literally do not care one bit about your wealth, status, how many cars you have or how big your house is. They approach every day with honest intent, they value people over material possessions and cherish their relationships.  Brought tears to my eyes seeing how overjoyed he was to meet Jack……and Jack………well he is a loving soul, reminding us how ridiculous it is to see yourself different or better than another human being. What a beautiful man he is and no one shut down the gigs or affection. Outside of being non verbal, one never has to speculate truth because truth is their default mode.
such a happy moment! i'd probably react this way if i saw JB, but then i'd likely be in jail for hugging him that much. Tanner is a as real as a human gets and you can see that JB sees it too. 🥰
Is Tanner's sister single?
😭😭😭😭😭 life is so good. Lol i adore jack black.
🤭😆🤣🤣😅💗🌻👍
I hate close talkers and noise. My autism couldn’t handle Tanner in person but it’s so nice to see him so happy.
He's faking it 😂 this is so f***ed
The best ❤
He loved Jack more than Rose did. He wasn't going to let go
Grown man in tears right here👌❤️
Is it terrible that I've watched this multiple times and never get sick of it!!!! Love Tanner and his family, props to Kelly for treating Tanner as the individual he clearly is, and Jack Black getting his glasses all steamed up. What a guy. Cue next video of them working out together!! PLEASE!!
80 students to 1 teacher. Damn!
Best thing on the internet
PROTECT TANNER AT ALL COST!!!!! 😢 🥰
I just wonder if he knew Jack's name or not 😂. Not trying to be mean but I thought spectrum people were quiet, some don't talk - they sure he doesn't have touretres? Jack Jack jack jack
Jack is truly a National treasure❤
I’m not crying 😩 -an autism momma
Some say they are still on set talking
BRo, the world NEEDS a workout show with these TWO
This makes my whole ❤ smile
This was so heartwarming. I came from watching the show and whats so great is jack black didnt say anything about him being too close and they both seemed so happy. Wish them all the luck!
Jack Black is a Satanist. Absolutely ridiculous
🥹🥹🥹❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you so much for this Kelly and Team! I really needed this today… Tanner is joy in motion. His presence is a reminder that the world still holds wonder, and that being fully alive is a choice we get to make every day. His gratitude shook me in the best way. I started the video one way and ended it another—lighter, softer, clearer.  So to Tanner: thank you, Sensei. Your example landed. I’ll try to follow with grace.  Jack, killer kicks and a hero in every sense of the word.
I’m not crying 😭 ❤
He reminds me of Ben Stiller for some reason 😅
Kelly is looking healthy as fk. Good for her.
This is the best video I have ever seen. I am SO happy the people from love on the spectrum are getting to fulfill dreams they have because literally no one deserves that more
How sad and all I asked was to be stepped on by Jack,  thanks for my name .
I loveeeeee Jack Black. This made me cry 😢.
I really really like Tanner ❤.
Love on the spectrum is very cheugy TV show...and only Australia can do that and nobody cares
4:15 jack in his mind probably: are u trying to punch me or kiss me?🤣
Tanner rocks! I love Jack Black even  more than I did before. ❤️
I love that Kelly isnt wearing false eyelashes and major glam. Yes!
I dont care if this is a giant commercial, these are two of the greatest guys meeting and my dopamine fix has been acheived!! 🎉😂😂❤ JACK BLACK FOREVER ❤
What a sweetheart 😂
His smile is so bright. His personality is of a shining star 🌟 As a mom of soon to be four, with 2 autistic children, this makes my heart incredibly happy. ❤ God bless this man and his kind soul and radiant spirit.
This is the most excited I have saw any human. EVER 😂 I bawled watching.
I don’t think I’ve ever seen jack black embarrassed by another person.  This dude has way too much energy. 😂
In grade six for our graduation we had to do a video on who you’d love to meet, I said Jack Black.   I’m 29 now, this video brings a tear to my eye. I’m glad I chose a great role model.
Everything about this episode is wholesome 😊
I love this guys energy and positivity!
I remember Jack Black showed up as a minor character in the x-files in the mid 90s, Jack has been all class since …
My lord, Tanner's energy is infectious. He's so great.
Jack Black is a truly awesome person. Gotta love that guy.
EIGHTY FIRST GRADERS?
🤗
Tanner has always held a special place in my heart. I live in Greenville and usually have been to the places Tanner takes his dates and so I'm always rooting for our local sweetheart. Not to mention, we just raise them different down here. Tanner obviously is an exemplary example, but we truly treasure being kind, polite, and trying to put a smile on someone's face. Tanner is just much better at it than most of us. Truly the definition of a southern gentleman. Good job, Mama 🥂
❤❤❤ 😂 that is lovely 🥰
I feel like tanner really wanted to kiss Jack on the cheek! So cute!
God damn I almost cried.  Jack Black is an amazing fucking human being!!
Wow. Watching this made me so happy.
The human race doesn't deserve Jack Black. (Tanner being the only exception).
So beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wow. Big respect for Black Jack. Tanner is one of my fave at Love Spectrum!
So much JOY!!!
Omg, this was so sweet! I love it!
Tanners never going to forget this day. Wait a go Kelly!
Sweet beautiful boy ❤
The greatest thing I've ever seen on television.  Gratitude lessons for us all!
A lesson to us all about what happiness looks like! Be ever so humble.    Money can't buy you love.
Southern charm  His adorable ❤❤❤
Tanner is the human embodiment of a golden retriever!! Even the way he reacted to meeting Jack! He is one of the most wholesome and genuine people on this entire planet 🥰🥰🥰
I am Stay
Tanner whispered to slide those digits so they can get swoll together. Loves dating because of the freedom. Pure gentleman who’s here for the ride. Hell yeah, Tanner.
Just pure joy.
Happy crying. Tanner is exactly what this world needs! ❤❤❤❤
TANNER NEEDS TO MAKE SOME MUSIC
AND I LOVE IT WHEN JACK BLACK SUPRISE TANNER SMITH ON THE SHOW
This melter my heart
I love how Kelly asks follow up questions. A lot of interviews are from people who don't know how to talk to a Neurodivergent person. Some interviewsers just say, "oh, I love that."
Wow... she looks different after the drug
Tanner is the sweetest, and Jack Black is an awesome guy! This made my day. ❤
This is the loveliest thing I’ve seen. ❤❤❤❤❤❤ my heart is so full!
adorable human being
I’ve watched this so many times now. Tanner is so sweet and I love how nice Jack was with him.
I don’t think I’ve ever heard Kelly called “ma’am”. He’s such a respectful gentlemen! ❤
Tanner is so lovely!
Can we get Tanner in a movie with Jack? Even a cameo common Jack make it happen!!
I’m not crying, you’re crying 😭
Tanner is such a vibe, he’s so positive and sweet. I wish him all the best!
I think this is the last true human emotion of really real true bewilderment and honest love left in the world we could all use a tanner in our lives
this is the cutest video i have ever seen he said im so excited to meet you jack my heart is melting away
Damn Tanners sister is beautiful
The world could learn a thing from Tanner. I love that guy!
Kelly clarkson really beautiful
Love this so heart warming ❤❤
Seems like he pays taxes
This is the best ever!!! I cried!!!!🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽🤩
This excitement is. Contagious!
jack black is the goat, it looks like he's still in Minecraftw mode with the shirt lol
Awe! This video brought me to tears!! This is so sweet and amazing!!!!!❤🎉❤🎉
Well mannered , loving, smart, respectful just to name a few.  Mind blown at the fact that he has autism.  We need more people with Tanner's heart ❤ I love hin
This is the same energy as when a puppy gets SUPER EXCITED when their favorite human comes through the door and just starts launching himself full force at his person. Pure unbridled joy and adoration.
I literally smiled from ear to ear watching this from start to finish
Pure heart like two golden retrievers❤
Pure joy! 🥰
This is fantastic! ❤
midge is like the most beautiful person on earth... the way she looks at tanner is pure love.
Got ya boy tearin up! Awesome frfr
In our current world full of negativity, how refreshing is Tanner's personality !?  He's a ball of sunshine and the epitome of positivity and kindness. And what a great guy... that Jack Black !
MY HEART JUST BURST WATCHING THIS 😁😁😁😁😁😁🇬🇧
Someone needs to show this video to RFK
Tanner is such a gem. My favourite person on the show. When the coach explained to him that he didn’t have to look happy all the time and he said that he wanted to make other people happy… I I felt that. Wish him and his family nothing but the best ❤
Omggggg Im not crying youre crying 😅😅😅
And the way you can tell Jack is getting emotional at the end 🥹
Im not crying you are😭🫡
Tanner is literally a Golden Retriever in a human body
This is not the Kelly I know she looks so different
Everyone on this video is 💯 amazing!!! 🤩
What a great way to normalize Autism for those unfamiliar.
I love both of them so much ❤
❤❤❤❤❤
OOM MGGGGGGGGGGG I LOVE TANNER SOOOOOOO MUCH I WANT TO MEET HIM I SWEAR I WOULD HAVE THE SAME REACTION I WOULD CRY ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ IM TANNERS BIGGEST FAN SERIOUSLY LOL
I'm bawling. Jack is so sweet and patient what a guy. And tanner is just the sweetest
It is the purity and  sincerity which touches my heart ❤
His joy almost made me cry! Tanner is the best! 😍
❤
I love Jack Black too! I dont think I could match Tanner's excitement but it would be close! I just want to hug the shit out of that man.. And i mean.. make him poop his pants. Cuz i literally hugged the shit out of him! Tanner did that..
OMG, this made my day, just pure Love and Joy from eveyone in that room❤
I love you Tanner!!! Thank you for making me smile so damn much, stay amazing!
Man I love Tanner so much!
Jack black running  through that door ❤
the way Jack Black runs gets me every time

what kind of world do we live in; where kindness, is a disability
I can't even. 😊
BEST video ever
I am overwhelmed with the amount of love here!! So amazing!!! So happy for Tanner 🩷😁🩷😁🩷
Lava chicken, Steve of a chicken is this bye-bye taste chicken

Amazing!! ❤❤❤❤❤
Omfg this is the best video on the Internet ❤
Sobbing crying throwing up with joy for both tanner & jack ❤️🫶 soul buds 🫶❤️
I love it!  🥰❤❤
Bawling. It's so heartwarming to see pure joy in a person. 🥺
What a great young gentleman tanner is! I would be proud to have him as my son 😊❤
Fair play to Jack Black what a top guy! As someone who has an autistic son they have no sense of personal space which can be quite intimidating for someone but he managed it so well and was so good with the man.
Man’s great chicken
Proof people on spectrum can and do have normal conversations.  My daughter is very slightly on the spectrum, and during Covid I taught her how to find the people interested in the stuff you are. Ask questions about things you're interested in. Like so have you seen any good movies? Games? Give a window to let them answer then refine genres. I also explained lots of people on the planet knowing where to find the people with similar interests becomes way easier once you get through K-12th, and start driving.  She recently came to me, "I've infiltrated 2 friend groups."😂  She says I'm most likely on spectrum and ADD . She really likes psychology, so who knows she might be right, but not from an era they  didnt care if your grades were alright.  I adore being around people on spectrum a billion times more interesting conversations imo. I substituted for a little bit, but stopped given anxiety with the company working for and the school asking me to work, and expand myself to other duties. I need at least a day's notice to sort myself and prepare. While subbing though got to work with the intervention kids, and I adored it. Even though only a few times. The kids were like, Oooo that makes sense. Side jokes. The one kid he was the only one in the one session, and for some reason I kept saying yup yup when he got something right. I never do that, but hysterical. The next time in the building he saw me in the hall and was like yup yup!"   I'm dyslexic, and wasn't identified  until I was an adult, but some how managed to self teach techniques that I later found out is how they teach kids with dyslexia how to navigate through things, so those kids I was able to reassure them they'll be ok, and gave tips on how to get good grades without losing your mind. It was delightful. If I'd realized that was a job when I was younger I would have opted for that, but an old lady now and a happily kept woman, but hope I had helped. 😂❤
This video is 6 minutes and I’m exhausted…
Tanner is genuinely one of the most beautiful people on the planet. He always has something so nice to say about everyone ❤
The Best Ever!  What a heart warming surprise for Tanner!  Thank you.  I’ve worked with children on the spectrum and my grandson has autism too.  This makes my day! 👍❤️👏
This is the best video I've ever seen!!! 😂❤🥹
😭😍❤❤❤
Awww who wouldn't love these guys on love on the spectrum they are so sweet and romantic ❤
I feel like I recognize his sister. Does she do videos about teaching kids? I remember a really poignant one about teaching kids how not to like someone (ie it’s ok to not like someone, but it’s not ok to be mean to someone because you don’t like them, you don’t have to tell anyone when you don’t like someone etc)
Tanner gives me so much joy
CHICKEN JOCKEY!
😢 done me , how fucking beautiful was that , I'm not crying your crying lool
Omg...this just made me cry so many happy tears!!
❤❤😭
😂
Darn i did not want to cry my makeup off before work. But that was wholesome ❤
This is why Jack Black is GOAT ❤
Tanner is the the most fun loving person earth. Jack that makes you a close second. Well done mate. Thank you.
Tanner koo asf
Kelly and Tanner have the same energy 😂😂
He’s as happy as a golden retriever every time he sees someone. Meanwhile we all look like robots. Autism can be beautiful.
I love this❤
Such a sweet kid
Jack Blacl is a great dude
This is so heart warming
“Yes maam it’s fuuun it’s very interesting an an an and so cool 😂😂😂😂
Look at his artistic lookin
Jack Black the man for this
Im not crying, you are crying!!
Kelly should give him a segment on her show. This world needs a little bit Tanner joy
That is amazing 🎉
I admire tanner how he talks and look at people. He doesnt care. Every waking moment i spend as a 30 year old man is done with the thought im annoying, need to shut up, overly aware of every moment going on around me, every awkward thing or possible flash of anger or annoyance. Its comforting seeing someone so open. I often think that maybe with the resources tanner had maybe i could have developed better skills earlier. Thanks for teaching me its okay to be austitic and teaching me it doesnt make me weak even tho i am a man.
So pure of heart🙏
I am gonna cry from laughing and love in this video. Wanna meet Jack too!!!!! <3 <3 <3
❤❤❤
I love tanner so much he tries so hard to
Tanners heart is so pure.
What a freakin' stud muffin. I swear.
How wonderful.  I absolutely love this.
I've always thought Jack Black was incredible but this takes my Fandom to a new height! And a huge boost of respect! We love you Jack! Tanner is the sweetest kindest human being we've been blessed to share our tvs with! A truly precious soul
👍
TANNERS SO CUTE
My Myles with the Smiles is autistic. He reminds me of him sooooooo much.😂😢😢😢 This made me crrrrry so hard. ❤❤❤
fucking hell my face hurts from smiling so much
I just adore everything about this ❤❤❤
I am Steve 😏😏
Who's chopping onions around here??
Lawd 😭😭😭😭😭🥹🥹🥹🥹
How come Kelly’s accent gets more southern?
I absolutely loved love on the spectrum
So I'm crying a little. I adore Tanner. His heart is so pure and kind. I hope all of his hopes and dreams are fulfilled. I also love the relationship Midge. Absolutely precious!!!!!!!!
Destiny's child
I LOVE TANNER!!!! He deserves nothing but the best
Such a wonderful gift to the world ❤
I'm crying because I'm so excited for Tanner.  Jack Black is the best.  ♥
I love jack black as an actor,make me laugh at his crazy Monologue
Oh man when they cut to his brother crying I lost it 😭
this one is just so heartwarming. Where is Kyle Gas honestly? If I was there, I'd show him a bunch of SpongeBob Edits from the Early-2010s where a bunch of Tenacious D audio snippets are on there. Amazing! In other words, I love it.
THANK YOU JACK!!!! 🥹
I haven’t smiled that much in a long time. What a beautiful interaction.
Tanner looking like he gonna kiss him 😂
Not me crying in the club
I got emotional! No filter, just being himself 🙏🏻❤️
This is seriously the best thing ever!!!!!!!
💚Beautiful of example of love and kindness all around, so touching!
This made me tear ❤up
Tanner is so pure he must be protected at all cost
This is Amazing!!
I'm crying. Lol❤
Just tears right now 3:38
He is so beyond polite and optimistic. Too sweet for words 💜💜💜
Awww, this is just the best thing I've ever seen!  Awwww, my eyes are all wet x🥰
I’m so glad he finally got to meet Jack
This! Thank you Kelly for making this happen ❤
This is why i hate politics because I started to dislike Jack Black over things he or his comedy partner said but none of that matters, hes a great guy for doing this & allowing Tanner to show how excited he was. A lot of actors and people in general wouldn’t know how to deal with that because we aren’t used to such affection but he handled it greatly
I'm not crying---you are.
I love Tanner so much. I just cry watching him sometimes bc he’s such a perfect soul.
This is what celebs should be doing all day and night!!!!!
my favorite things about this interview: jack black never once backed up or moved away, kelly clarkson introduced, looked at, and spoke to tanner the way she would to any other guest, and his sister pointing out how her brother got her students to listen to him better than they listen to her, their teacher
So sweet 😢❤😅❤
Jack Black has always been an inspiration. A real one. Look at how he interacted with tanner. That was special. What a beautiful moment I've come back to watch this again because i seen someone posted about it ❤. Will never get old. Thank you jack black i loved everything jack said to him, was real, it was effortless in a good way. Thank you tanner for showing us pure rawness, it's something we all once had. Tanner is blessed he will have that forever. Love you dude ❤
Love Tanner. I can't stop crying when I see him because he is so wholesome.
Beautiful:) love is in the air:) So much love here...Yay Tanner and Jack:)
why am I crying
Jack is a clown.
Jack Black is just an awesome human being.
Tears and more Tears-What an Angel Tanner is- Thank you Ms. Kelly- This is a memory Tanner will take with him for the rest of his life. As a mother to an Autistic son-They keep memories good and bad with them daily. And this will be his ..... god bless
I love tanner!!! So so much ❤❤
Omg i love this…Tanner you are the sweetest.  ❤❤❤
I'm a 42 year old autistic man. My sons are as well. Seeing this warms my heart. Kudos to those that made it happen.
I have watched the show “Love on the spectrum” and tanner is the SWEETEST person on earth! This is so adorable ❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is the best 🎉
Jack black what a pro he was so nice and humble to a great fan 🙂
Unbelievably wholesome and beautiful! 😊😊😊
I want to date Tanner! Is it unethical to date someone on the spectrum?? He just makes me so happy and warm feeling
I think Jack Black was taken back a little bit because that young man was all in his space, but he was extremely polite about it, and this is the sweetest thing and it melted my heart. ❤
Tanner is one of Gods beautiful children ❤️
tanner is truly jack blacks biggest fan
That’s awesome.
day made!!!!
Tanner's personality is perfect for TV. Very animated and always bright eyed.
So heartwarming 🫶🏻
TANNER, JACK, AND KELLY- I COULD NOT LOVE THREE PEOPLE ANY MORE!! ❤❤❤❤❤ (heart is ✨ exploding✨!)
Did somebody cut an onion? Ughhh 🥰🥰🥰 Jack IS an AMAZING human being!
Tanner makes me proud to be autistic. We are among the kindest souls; just look past our quirks and extend grace for how we communicate. Don't assume we lack empathy—many of us have it in abundance. Be cautious when judging body language: lack of eye contact, resting B face, slow responses, crossed arms, or visible anxiety don't imply dishonesty; they might indicate autism. Thank you, Tanner and Love on the Spectrum, for representing autistics labeled as "low support needs." We face high unemployment and su*c*de rates, and survival often requires us to conform to neurotypical norms, despite the impossible pressure to mask our true selves. Masking exhausts us and can lead to intense self-harming meltdowns that neurotypicals may not comprehend. We need your help though. Especially those autistics who dont have supportive families like Tanner. Often times these autistic people choose to mask as much as possible for fear of being bullied or losing their job. A helpfuly aly In the workplace and at school can look like someone who is willing to answer our clarifying questions (and there can be a lot and they can range from emotionally intense to analytically rough-around-the-edges). Someone who's willing to help us navigate a social situation. We are not built with inborn social awareness. We must be taught what to say and how to act and memorize scripts. But often times situations arise where our memorized scripts don't apply and we become lost and confused. We may not tell you we are autistic but we may reach out for help in the above ways. It may seem weird to you and that's understandable but we are very vulnerable in society and God may use you in our life as a refuge from the storm. ❤️
I haven’t cried like this in a while❤
Tanner is our Worlds Hype Man!!!!❤❤❤ I love him❤
“And thank you for showing me how to be independent”  THIS is SOOO important and helps us with our identity a TON. Thank you Mr, Rick!♥️
BOOM NO https://youtu.be/jBgtYehv5SY?si=Bx5fL54vnVRTReN0
This guys faking it
That went exactly as I thought it would 😂 bless them both, legends
I adore Tanner ❤
God I adore Tanner!
my flex is that I drove past jack black on the street
Tanner is pretty much Tropic Thunder guy.
I understand he’s an adult with autism, but when Jack Black came on stage, Tanner really just let his inner kid come out. You can see the awe and overwhelming emotion ❤❤❤ this is so wholesome
I'm not crying, IT'S ALLERGIES! ❤️❤️❤️
We are all crying right?
I love Taylor's excitement his energy I literally love Tanner he seems like such a nice person I would love to meet him
I’m crying omg 😂❤❤
man,everybody loves jack black,like literally nobody hates him
I wish I could be as enthusiastic as Tanner he just seems so sweet all the time.
Oh my that's so sweet!
Had a testosterone shot yesterday but still managed to weep tears of joy at this.  Beautiful <3
🫶🏼much love 💯🎬🫡
As a neurodivergent. We’re not your freak show
This is beautiful
That was so adorable.  🥲
Love this kid! GO TANNER!!!!! Hope The best for you!!!! Such an innocent soul!!!
"this just in: tanner from LotS was never autistic, was acting the whole time.."
Brilliant. Just Brilliant! ❤
I ❤ Tanner ❤❤❤ Such a Beautiful Soul
God bless you tanner x
What a sweet, stand up guy. Must be an unforgettable moment to meet his fave!
❤❤❤ I love Jack black.even more
'Jack it's you' pure joy ❤. Go Tanner and well done Jack 👏
very happy 😃 for
Omg my heart well done fella
All the love in the world. ❤😂
This is so sweet 😂❤
This is awesome. I hope Jack knows that this may be one of the best days of HIS life as well. Tanner with his pure soul gave him so much trust in front of the world.. and Jack handled that trust beautifully.
“We’re busy guys aren’t we Jack 😄?”  This guy rules
poor Jack Black :D
why did this make me cry 🥺😭💘 I love them
Jack Black is probably the best celebrity for this. Tanner is so high energy and sweet and gets so close to Jack, but I don't feel like Jack was uncomfortable at all.
Umm he’s faking
Oml! Precious! Fills my heart with joy ❤ What a moment😅
Please don't use people to promote your bullshit movie.
Holy guacamole this was so sweet
This is genuinely 100% no filter at all.
I love this so much!
I LOVE IT !!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤I am on tears ❤
❤
I haven’t happy cried like this in so long 🥹😭❤️ oh my goodness
His sister is an angel and so is he
There isn't anything about this that I don't love. ❤❤❤ More of this in the world please
It's cute...but disabled people still need to ask for consent before hugging randoms🫤 lots of these disabled people just grab someone and hug them without asking consent. We would accept it from a random normie...so we should patronize neurodivergent people and let them get away with it either 😢
Literally screaming in his ears lol.
I love him. I just love him dearly. 잭형 ❤
Ooo ozempic
This is truly one of the best videos I've ever seen. I'm crying my heart out. ❤😭  I'm a little autistic, but have the most difficult mix of ADHD.  And I appreciate the love and tolerance in this video. The whole audience is celebrating the feelings of this great guy.❤🎉  Thank you, Kelly Clarkson, for this moment and thank you Jack Black, for the love you spread around the world. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🌎♥️♥️♥️
Love love on the spectrum we have a version of that program in denmark if i translate the title it is "oopsie, i am an adult " ,love both programs ❤❤❤love how sweet and how much the inner child just shows omg jack jack jack im ur biggest fan ,the rapid talking and he is so flipping sweet srsly❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤u so hansome❤😂
Tanner is so sweet.  ❤
Tanner is a golden retriever in a humans body. He has the most beautiful energy
Tanner is awesome!!! ❤❤❤
👏🏻 yes Jack Black what a guy! Great interview Kelly. Tanner is amazing 🙌🏼
this is EXACTLY why im an NDIS support worker, id love to work with more people on the autism spectrum too esp as my late Pop's legacy was founding THREE schools for people with severe autism raising MILLIONS running marathons till just a few yrs b4 passing, i do music therapy but im head of hip hop, if anyones in NSW AUS google Relyability! we do all kinds of art/music and more as NDIS support for people with neurodiversities - this brought me to tears but im a softy lol
Tanner is such a lovely person❤❤!
My daughter has autism and our family LOVES this show!!! It makes my daughter soooo happy! She’s always wishing she could meet some of them💕
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
wtf is going on ?
My brother has autism and although I am very used to it, it isn't always easy to communicate with people on the spectrum. Jack Black and Kelly were naturals.
Tanner is so excited ❤
Tanners got me beat by being his biggest fan, no shot
When Tanner whispered @ and I can get your phone number" that was tooo funny! BC i would want to do the same if I met my fav celebrity!  Thanks for bring us so much joy Tanner!
I love Tanner. He’s pure joy. Seeing him meet Jack was magical. Like watching your kids see the Magic Kingdom fireworks for the first time. You could tell that Jack loved it, too. So sweet! I truly wish Tanner all the happiness in the world because he just exudes happiness to others.
Please don't lose more weight.  O love you a little plump.😊
The way he introduced Jack to his sister was the absolute sweetest 😭.
I’ve watched these two meeting like 50x. So uplifting and inspiring. 🤘🏼❤
My girlfriend and both of her kids are on the spectrum and combined they don’t have a fraction of Tanner’s energy! 😂  She actually loves Jack Black too and believes that he is probably neurodivergent as well.
So much love ❤️ this was so wholesome and the very best thing ever. I think if I met my idol I would try desperately to hold all of the excitement in or act cool- but Tanner doesn’t hold any of that admiration in that he has for Jack and it’s just so happy and makes me smile❤ I just finished the series and it was great! Now to watch the minecraft movie!
Midge 😊
We love you Tanner!
Tucker Carlson is very energetic today
It’s so nice that Tanner is helping that autistic young man meet his hero
Kelly Clarkson over rated like Drew Barry more .
Oh tanner you are amazing darling
Good job jack! smiling tears
You mean the guy that said he wished a president dead ?  Nice dude
This is so weird for the first time in my life seeing an interview with someone with my name spoken aloud 😳
Awesome x proper American behaviour.
This is so fking cool well done everyone
This is so freaking sweet!!!
I’m not crying, you’re crying. 🥹😅
Tanner is an amazing guy and Jack is an awesome dude. If I could meet one celebrity it would defo be jack black. Absolute legend
The world needs this right now. I needed this right now. Thank you to all the wonderful people who made this happen and for the truly amazing Tanner.   Every child is born with a pure heart and a full soul but sometimes life eats away at them, it seems in Tanners case his heart and soul just keep growing.
Seriously need more of jack and tanner
This was the best moment of my life too, Tanner 🥺❤️
80 first graders for one teqcher!?
😍😘♥️😭
What a sweetheart ❤
Too intense & the film’s shit.
Jack got the tears. Steamy glasses. ❤ I feel like at the very end, Jack was trying to hold back his emotions.
I’m not crying you are
I could only watch this a million times!!!! ❤❤
Thank God his favorite person wasn't Seinfeld!
He is adorable 😍
Its beautiful 😊😊😊
OMG I can't with Tanner 😂❤ he's so adorable and genuine
Jack Black is thinking: so this is a puppy in human form ❤
Omg I'm crying!!! How wonderful ❤️
hes clearly faking it
This clip made my day. I'm smiling at the innocent display of love. This is what the world is supposed to be about
Jack black is married?😭I’m envy that woman
Ahhh this is sow cute ❤
❤❤❤
Omg this was the cutest encounter ever🥰😍 So nice that Tanner got to meet his idol! And Jack is such a cool dude, he’a truly awesome😆😁
I have not seen kelly clarkson in a long time, she looks absolutely incredible here. I dont know if she is wearing less or no makeuo but it looks great on her.
Hey look it's "Jack I Hate America, Black"
This is what I come to the internet for. All incredible people having beautiful moments! 💚👌🏻
Tanners sister, dayummmm. Hott
The Nether

Demon host devils appearance.

Tanner is the best actor in this segment
I LOVE TANNERRRRR 😊❤
I love this! Tanner embodies pure and authentic joy
I dare you to watch Tanner and not smile. It's impossible! He's pure happiness.
This is so cool.
That was the most wholesome, loving, overload of sweetness I have seen in a long time.
The fact this was probably the highlight of Tanner’s life & he still remembered right away to introduce his sister and his mom. What a sweet kid.
Tanner is the best
I love that Tanner dated Callie! I know her from Special Books by Special Kids, she’s so wonderful and a sweetheart.
This is so sweet lol
That make me misty
That is love. What a class act Mr Black ❤
Can I please have half this joy in my heart Lord😢😊❤
I wish I could enjoy life like him, just to see things through his eyes.
God this is sooooo AWESOME!!!!! 🥹 I just love a moment in time where human beings are being kind to one another & allowing someone like Tanner to experience “the best day of his life” with no judgement! Just UNPARALLELED EXCITEMENT!!! I’m so happy right now
The Seinfeld episode with the close talker LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
My ❤will never be the same! What a blessing Tanner is and Jack is so kindhearted, not a lot of celebrities would do that.  He was Genuinely touched. ❤
he is just an ANGEL
This got me so emotional. It’s good to see kind wholesome people celebrated and brought together.
I loooooove Tanner
Tanner is the BEST. I want a hug from him
This guy is like a nuclear reactor of positive energy 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Jack Black is a National Treasure. Protect him AT ALL COSTS!!!
Awwww I love thisssss🥰🥰🥰
I believe that Jack is extremely overrated as far as an actor and entertainer, however, he has shown me that he is underrated as a genuine human being.
I can't love this enough ❤
If only all humans were this innocent and pure.. He is live in physical form
This was one of the best things I've ever seen!❤
This is so sweet and beautiful and amazing
I hate jackblack. No a funny person
IN TIME…..🤨🤨🤨….❤️🤍💙
Tanner is the best human.
Absolutely love Tanner ❤❤❤
Kelly looking amazing.
Love Tanner! Love Jack Black! Wow, this was so amazing.
Like a golden retriever when you get home from work
Wtf!
I love me some jack black omg this had me so teary eyed 🥲
Dammit! Tears….😭😭😭
I have discovered a man that cannot be matched in humanitarian effort or KNOWLEDGE AFORE THOUGHT. He's a kind of IMMACULATE BEING, like A VIBRANT STAR racing across the GLORIOUS KNIGHT SKY. He makes you laugh, makes you cry, AND VERY OFTEN, some have even claimed that they would like to curse him out. BEHOLD, a raisin IN THE SUN.. 🤤👀✌️https://youtu.be/83Ux4JJZwXo?si=wkif8oFDZ_LACE1V
I didn't cry
This really warmed my heart like when ariana Grande went to go see bri bri 😢😢❤❤🎉
Joyful video!  May no one dull the sparkle ✨
Little T-rex arms
Tanner is so blessed with that God given spirit XOX
Was Tanner forced to get the HAIRCUT of an autistic person? 🤣
I thought we were done with that turd Jack Black!!
I didn’t know Bonnie Blue had a disabled brother
I’m brought to tears….jack black is amazing! Tanner is so respectful….awesome guy
i realize now after watching this back a 2nd time that Tanner said  He was a grooms man at his sisters wedding. The 1st time i watched it i thought he said his sister married Oscar Guzman.  😂
Tanner exudes such exquisite joy. May Jesus bless him. Oh my gosh. He is a gem!
This made me smile 😊 😁 so big so beautiful 😻❤️
He's seriously the sweetest soul alive.
Jack Black a masive,telented and kind guy. Then we have the snow white girl...
So sweet!! I love Tanner ❤️
Tanner is my boy for real lol, this man has goals more than I do. Jack Black is an absolute legend for this.
This made me cry his my favourite actor and my son also had autism this is the sweetest thing
I didn't need another reason to love Jack Black. This was awesome
Kelly Clarkson is looking fine 👌
This makes my heart explode with happiness ❤️❤️
Yeah, we’ve not forgotten how he backtracked and abandoned his band mate after he talked shit on Trump. Have a back bone and stand up for the people you claim to support, Jack, or don’t you come back.
Ok, Jack. You just became my favorite. I always loved you, but I'm now sobbing at your reaction or lack of one❤. My heart feels ready to burst. Tanner and Jack, with a sprinkle of Kelly and Midge. This is real life.
Lame and cringe
Western world is cooked
This melts my heart!
I freaking love Jack Black. Dudes movies have made me feel so good and happy during difficult times❤️
this is the best thing I’ve ever seen
His energy dropped as soon as he realized that dude would be on his face that much 🍕
Atta boy Jack you did good son.
I have 2 children on the spectrum, 20 yrs and 3 yrs and they both have loved Po, ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Kelly is still so fine 😩
The greatest surprise meeting since Kelly Clarkson  met Meryl Streep  😆    #Ilovekellyclarksonlikeshelovesmerylstreep 🍷🌻
This made me so happy, I feel like I met jack black!😅
He needs to be taught not to get into people's faces
Tanner is so sweet. Love him. I’m autistic. Many people think we can’t build good relationships but a lot of of us are very happy and upbeat people.
Jack black is one of my all time favs.
The amount of times I’ve cried over the people on the show. Tanner is just so amazing ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I live in Stuy Town in NYC where Rick was the CEO/GM. He’s the best and we miss him here, but so happy for him and his wonderful hotel and that he gets to see Tanner on a regular basis! I wish I could work them all in SC!
This made me cry😭
I absolutely loved the Netflix series Love on the Spectrum. The participants and the parents are truly inspiring and amazing people rare in the world. ❤
Damn, he’s sweet. Golden Retriever energy.
I adore Tanner!!
Since Jack Black went woke he's starting to look like Rosie O'Donnell more and more every day.
Omg I fucking love jack black he is just the sweetest person ❤
This is so sweet!! When I was studying live TV production in college and we had to practice interviewing classmates, someone had to interview an autistic student and one guy actually said "I dont know how to interview that!!" I'm autistic myself and I interviewed him and he ended up being my really good friend. Always treat people like people 💕🎀💖
Crying watching this ❤
Well done to rik and all the guys at the hotel    jack black   brilliant 👏
Oh my goodness ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😢😢❤❤❤❤❤❤that's so AWESOME ❤
I cried watching this I love Jack Black so much

Jack took his glasses off because of happy tears
Tanner is so pumped 😂 the sweetest man Jack Black is.
This is the coolest and sweetest thing
This is the most wholesome thing I’ve ever seen. Wow Jack Black is a class act. He is such a warm and accepting person. He must be protected at all costs !!!!
Oh my gosh he is absolutely precious 🥰
I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS
Awe i friggen love Tanner and JB!!
I’m so thankful that I get to live in a world where it’s becoming more and more common to give these people the chance to be themselves without judgement. ❤
Nothing but respect for every person involved. God is so good. Precious ❤
What a delight he is.
So pure ❤
What a sweet human! ❤  Jack too!
Tears of heart felt joy. So priceless.
Can you scream exploitation and virtue signaling any more loudly?
Awwwww....tears
I feel like a lot of people would act like this around Jack Black. Deservedly so.
Love Tanner! Hope he was chewing some gum or something tho lmao
Love Tanner! Hope he was chewing some gum or something tho lmao
Jack Black, you are awesome!
Miss Kelly 🥹
crying !!!!!
this is sososososos beautiful and fun! I love every moment of this video.
I’m actually bawling my eyes out
Omg tanner is amazing, truly a sweet heart. His reaction seeing jack black is truly heartwarming
Bonnie blue is really starting to cross the line.
Can we all agree that Tanner is one of Gods most beautiful creations? 🥹❤️💕💜
Mad respect to jack👏🏼 Kelly too. It can be a lot when someone like tanner gets excited. Kudos for showing patience and respect. 🫡
Jack is a legend! I love that guy!
Crying at his pure unbridled joy. You can tell Jack is purely in his heart at being so beloved.
Well, I found a bunch of happy tears waiting for the right occasion, and this was it!!!
doesn’t jack black support autism speaks, an organization with 0 autistic people on their directing board that regularly supports research for a "cure" to autism?
I'm not crying, you're crying! ... 🩷 Jack Black is so humble. Tanner is so happy!!
I love Tanner so much! So happy one of his dreams came true ❤ He deserves so many blessings.
I love Tanner so much ❤ such an awesome dude.
JB is useless.
Why did this make me wanna shed some when jack came out tho 🥹🥲❤🙏
I know he is super excited but please help him with space lol he’s spitting all over jacks face! 😅
Jokes on you I was planning on crying 😭
Love Jack Black.
Two of my favorite people!!!! Tanner and Jack!!!! I would love to hug them both!!!!!!✌🏼💜🐼
Don't give him your number, he'll never stop calling 😂
Jack black is definitely someone I hope I can be when I’m older
I need Tanner in my life. He's the best... Funny to see Jack overwhelmed by someone who has more energy and more in your face than he is .lol🎉
I'm sorry but I can't stand him
I have always wanted this for my sisters to meet jack black. So wonderful to see it happen.
I'm 40 and you're making me fucking cry. Fuck sake.
Listen that was the best greeting 😂😂😂
This is so wholesome
I'm crying!!! He's so adorable! I wish my kids would get out in the world and meet ppl to date🙏
Tanner is adorable! And so polite!    I hope he can find happiness!
Cause hes on a press tour
I love that his sister , Kelly, and Jack didn't say ok let's let Jack have some space or let's quiet down, or have that vibe or non verbal communication, or even make a joke but in a way that means that's enough now,  and didn't try to tamper this down for TV or for "jacks sake" etc even though I am sure that is the instinct for many, and I'm sure Kelly has people in her ear saying producer and director things, and them not being condescending or like ok ok and taking away this guys joy was an extra thing that makes this great , the absence of any of that. Jack is used to being the one who is on, the one who is doing high energy jumps spins trying to be the crazy cooky guy, I think it would be a change to be the tame one. This was lovely. Some celebrities would be very TV but you could tell they weren't comfortable or looking elsewhere for like reassurance "help" safety commiseration etc whatever but none of that was seen on Jack that didn't seem fake nice or nice because he's special needs at all. What a lovely thing in this blah world
Tanner telling Jack, "you're so handsome" is just like...damn. Imagine meeting an idol and instead of wanting some type of validation from them, you just want to build them up. That's crazy and I literally can't relate.   Tanner is a much better version of the man I hope to be.
I've always thought Jack was a good dude with a huge heart but I have a lot more respect after seeing him do this for Tanner.
Well thanks for letting the tears fall
I love you so much Tanner! Your the fresh breath of air that the world needs, we all need you in our lives!
Couldn’t stop crying 😭 ❤❤❤❤ he is the best omg 😱 cried!!!
It makes me very happy to see individuals with autism or special needs be treated as individuals, as adults and as human beings.  Theybate people too!! Ive worked in the schools in special education and they all have a purpose in life.  This is just awesome.  Thank you nto the folks who treat individuals with special needs with respect and with dignity ❤❤❤❤
I love him 🥹🫶🏼
The best thing Ive seen recently. Pure unfiltered love and kindness. Tanner is sunshine! ❤
I just balled my eyes out. So much love.
Well, I can't stop crying.
I needed this so much. My kids are on the spectrum, as am I; and this makes my heart swell. Kelly & Jack are just good people. ✊🏾👏🏾
Tanner meeting Jack Black has me in tears. He is so pure of heart 🥹😍
Aww this was AMAZING! Kelly looks  incredible too!
Jack black is such a sweetheart. I love how humble he is ❤❤❤❤
why did this moment make me cry??? Tanner is such a beautiful soul and seeing his amazing energy compared with Jack Black's was more than I could have hoped for. 😭
Jack was starting to get scared at the end there lmaoooo
I’m just sitting here in my car crying tears of joy. This was so nice of Jack Black to take the time to meet him. You could tell he was overjoyed to meet Jack Black in person. So sweet.
SO ADORABLE
As if I wasn’t already obsessed enough with Jack Black.
This is SO beautiful!!!  Crying like a baby :)
Tanner may be the best man on Earth.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Love seeing this dude spread awareness.. had so many people try to claim autism means you don't like touching, but love on the spectrum has really showed people how different many of us affected by autism are and that no individual is the same as another.
Im glad Jack dropped that creepy guy he used to be in a band with.  He has been riding Jacks coat tails for decades.
I love this so much ❤
Tanner reminds me of an excited puppy just pouncing all over you with love.
I’m literally crying! This made me so happy 🥰🥰💕❗️
Did she say 80 1st graders? She's the principal right? Or do teachers really have that many kids in one room? Collage/high-school make sense but 1st grade? Maybe I herd wrong but I swear she said 80😂😅😅
May not like Jack's political party, but I love his big heart.
I was laugh crying at multiple parts throughout this clip. So beautiful perfect. Kelly is an amazing host and this was a magical moment.
JB is what world peace looks like
Jack Black is perpetually drunk on HollyWeird liberal kool aide. When I saw him shilling, wildly, as that is his only schtick , for biden/SOROS, with barack HUSSEIN obama looking on like the evil villain he, I felt hatred build within me till I was consumed.  THEY had gotten to him.  Just another out of touch with HUMANITY AND REALITY, CONDESCENDING, CELEBRITY peering down on us USELESS EATERS TO WANT TO PAY THEIR BILLS AND OUR CHILDREN AND LOVED ONES ALIVE.
I wish more people were happy like Tanner and had his demeanor.
He’s so wholesome ! Has me crying 🥹
He is the cutest human!
I absolutely love Tanner! He is the sweetest soul. I hope he finds his true love!
Adults on the spectrum love is sooo beautiful!! And pure 😢❤ we need to learn so much from them. Love this Kelly!!! You’re awesome and Jack black too.
Absolutely uplifting and beautiful!!!!!❤️❤️ We need more of this in today's world.
I thought Kelly was Anthony Davis for a second there
Autism mom here, what a beautiful moment, so sweet and joyful it made me laugh and tear up! All we ever want is our children to be seen, accepted and appreciated for all their uniqueness and their beautiful spirit! This was just that. Love ❤
I guess Jack the only one in Hollywood not on that Ozempic
I cried.  Jack black is so fantastic
Jack might be the coolest person alive.
Kelly’s looking good..
Oh my God is that jack black? No way!
As an only parent of a pair of spectrum teens, this made my heart smile! And if Kelly needs a date...😉
I ve always liked Jack Black, but now, as a mother of an autistic son, I adore and appreciate him
Oh my gosh 😂❤ I love him
How old is he actually?
Love Tanner. Cannot tolerate Jack Black anymore. Bro has literally lost his mind.
I was just watching this show today thinking about how sweet that kid is and then here's Jack Black how cool
Tanner has so much love it's infinite ❤❤❤❤ I'm obsessed with this interaction!!
Amazing but personal space is still needed
I have 3 autistic kids 18,6 and 5. I absolutely love this interview, everything about it. Tanner is an inspiration for so many 💙💙💙 and my opinion on Jack Black couldn't be higher. He's a wonderful man
The thumbs up to Mrs. Kelly was so sweet ❤❤❤❤
Oh Jack, Midge, Tanner, Kelly why am I crying ❤💝
These guys are stars the show is so good
That's Kelly Clarkson?
Calling Kelly clarkson ms. Kelly is so cool of him 😅
my hearttt
3 of the sweetest people in 1 video ❤
This makes me love Jack all the more for this
This is sooo sweet omg I wanna cry
Tanner wanted to crawl inside of Jack’s body.
I couldn't love this more!! Tanner was so excited ❤😂🎉
i’m crying
he's a golden retriever actually, take off your mask young man, there's a golden boy inside of you I can see it !!!
I like Jack Black and this mae me respect him even more!!!
🥰🥰🥰🥰
This is the best thing ever
Jack Black is the Robin Williams of my generation. Protect that man at all costs. Tanner too!!  ❤❤❤
He is like a golden retriever in human form love him
“Don’t miss next time “
Tanner is sooo cute!
I have an autistic student who also loves Jack Black and this made me ugly cry.  God bless Kelly and Jack for their kindness.
Looooove this! I am crying laughing but also happy tears for him🎉🥹😂
This guy is so sweet, the way he introduces his sister shows how much he treasures people.   He should have a youtube channel for kids, they would absolutely eat him up.
You missed Hahahahahahahahaha
Jack doing what he does best, bringing warmth to our hearts. Smiles upon our faces .
Love Jack. He is a cutie💓
❤
Tanner has the best possible mix of autism. Tanner is such a nice guy; very well mannered. I hope he does find love. Everyone deserves someone.
Man , I actually envy this guy. To be this happy and in the moment would be amazing
Nobody still likes Jack Black  Trust me, his career is still over
i forgot i had 2x speed on so when i clicked it bros running super fast lmfaooooo
I've learned so much about autistic people from love on the spectrum.
Sweetest video lately!!!
A lot of people are put off by his enthusiasm & physical closeness - but Jack Black didn’t shy away from it at all.  Love them both so much!
I did not think I would be sobbing by the end of this 😭😂😂😂 I'm so happy for Tanner ❤❤
How beautifully touching. Such an uplifting and inspiring young man. Tanner, Jack Black, and Kelly Clarkson all at once. Fantastic 😁
8===============D
When he turned to the audience to introduce Jack to EVERYONE. ❤
I had the biggest, goofiest smile on my face throughout this whole video. Tanner is such a ray of sunshine!
It’s so authentic that he just wants to hug him and touch him and hold him! This is our impulse as humans when we are so in love with someone! Excited about someone!
This is very cute
How can anyone say that people on the autism spectrum are a threat to America? This pure hearted bundle of joy is a threat? In whose eyes? And what’s wrong with their eyes?
If there's ever been anyone more insufferable than overrated Jack black I'd like to hear it but I doubt such a person exists
He made me smile from start to finish. What a pure soul
That's so lovely
Tanner and his sister look like twins.
Uh oh fart
I am not even joking...  I WISH I could feel half of that happiness.
Kelly Clarkson is lookin fiiiiine 🥵
He’s so lovely on the show! Love his positivity
Kelly Clarkson has randomly aged backwards?
That is the sweetest thing I've ever seen ❤
My daughter has Autism and I hope one day she finds a young man like Tanner. He is a class act and gentleman. His sister is so sweet, too. ❤
If everyone could be half as pure as Tanner. ❤
Bro is so obbnxious saying the same thing in a row like nobody can here him
Jack Black is just such an incredible human being. He's never let fame change him.
Forgive me for asking but i need some understanding- i just heard about Tanner and i dont watch the show hes on but he us a joy yo watch but im aware he has autism but im not aware of the level he us on to be joyfully hyperactive and repetitive.  Can someone explain to me about him so i have more of a history about who he is. Again, im just genuinely asking because i want to be more aware because autism has many levels and i dont know much mire than Aspergers because my nephew has it and closes himself in while my fiancee has it and is very social.
I love the way he let personal space be invaded was incredible!
Made my night
Awww how I love these two❤❤
Tanner’s passion is infectious!
Homeboy was practically going to SA Jack! 😂
Jack is the best.!!!
I love him!
I love him whispering at jack at then speaking full volume about trading phone numbers.  Tanner is the absolute best.
Your enthusiasm is an inspiration, Tanner!
Omg thats so sweet
Who doesn’t love Jack Black.
So cool😊
So beautiful & adorable! Tanner is amazing!!! ❤️❤️❤️
The best 6 minutes of television you could watch anywhere, or at least currently tied with the latest season of Love on the Spectrum!
I cant stop crying ❤❤❤
This is the most adorable thing EVER!!!!!
I cried😊
Omg. Such pure joy.
Omg.. I love this. My daughter zooms in on me, too, when she gets excited.
🔪🧅🧅😭
Traitor!!!!!! F Jack
This is what we Americans are all about love and respect, come together America please don’t let politics divide us
i have autism myself and its cool to see someone get to meet their idol, and i feel like if i was in a position where i met my idols like i imagine going to disney and if i met the princesses like especially ariel i would probably need to use my alternative forms of communication because i'm not able to speak well like verbally and am much better through text and half the time it feels like i cannot speak, like physically my mouth just cannot form the words so thats why i use alternative forms of communication   i am so happy for tanner and i love his energy haha!  although i'm personally a lot more quiet than he is, i see a lot of parents of people with autism in the comments saying they cried so i wanted to comment as a person who has autism ----- and yes,, i do present pretty overtly irl i know a lot of parents seem to thing someone who can write like this online must not be autistic but i irl have a constantly bent arm bc if i straighten it it feels weird, i talk in this very specific and "odd" tone of voice that is a mumble and kinda flat and often can sound "young" according to some people, i am always moving my fingers, i often when i'm not speaking with my voice have to rely on other forms of communication, i don't engage in many discussions that aren't about my interests, i don't say hello or goodbye, and bring my dolls with me everywhere   i am happy that the host here didn't talk down to him, because we can get a lot of that in our day to day lives where people tend to treat us like we're kids --- and i'm under 4 feet 10 inches in real life, so i know what thats like on top of being autistic, it can be kinda uncomfortable when i am getting my blood drawn at the doctor's office and they have to bring someone else to hold me down and call me "little one" and other names associated with kids because i do not like needles and have sensory issues to the smallest smells, sounds and feelings like i've once walked out of a library because it felt too loud without telling my case manager  but what i'm saying is that i actually really appreciate jack black and the host here for treating tanner like a person, because we don't get that a lot in our day to day lives as autistic people
I cried real tears seeing this!!! If Jack Black was having a bad day, he wasn’t after meeting Tanner!
Saw Minecraft twice already it was so good! IMAX is the way to go!
I'M CRYING LIKE MY MOM DIED
🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🌻🍃🤗
Aww. So sweet. Our adult son is autistic but high functioning. I see so many similarities. God bless Jack and this young man.
As a mother of 2 adults with severe autism this just made my heart explode.. Thank you Jack for seeing him and not flinching when he huged you.. They struggle so much with personal space and you just embraced it.. Oh the tears.. So many treat our children so badly and to see him be so kind.. ❤️❤️❤️🤗 you are a hero Jack.. Thank you for giving him a day he will remember forever.. I hope both my boys receive this type of love and acceptance in their lifetime
This is so precious & perfect !
I love Tanner💜💛
Jack is giving him nothingggg
Awe god bless him.  My son is non verbal autistic, I hope one day he talks. He stims a lot too. His thing is jumping, but he does all a lot of the stims
This is such a wholesome moment. Tanner blows me away with his impeccable manners and great love for life ❤
I needed this today....and every day from now on...❤❤❤❤❤❤ this is PURE ❤❤❤❤
TANNER!!!! Giving Jack all the love - so great!!
When was the last time you were this happy for anything? Brought tears to see genuine happiness.
Just toooo sweeet!   My gosh, Tanner’s exuberance came right through my screen!  I couldn’t stop wide smiling! I don’t watch these shows, but decided to click on the vid from the story I was reading about it. Heard of LOTS on Netflix, but again, don’t watch.   I hardly recognized Kelly!  She’s looking almost _totally different_ from whenever I saw her last! Good thing I knew it was her show.  Don’t think I’d of known her, otherwise.  Well, her voice.... All the best to Tanner.  I’m sure he’s perfect for his part in the show. Blessings to him & his family. ♥🕊
Probably should have had a back up plan!! He got a little too excited and could have gone the wrong way... Someone jump in and settle him down.
Kelly also looks so good and healthy not like scary skinny I love this for her
Awwww he makes me cry ❤ he’s so sweet!
This was beautiful
WOOoOoOOOOoO! 🎉❤
Tanner, the human Golden Retriever.
Jack Black is awesome. Continues to add to his LEGEND status.
I love Tanner ❤😭💕
Jack Black is an amazing human being!! I liked him before but I love him now.
I smiled this whole interview! My household loves Tanner!!!
This made me cry
Oh my god I’m bawling 😭 this was the most heart warming video I’ve seen. Tanner has the most beautiful soul ❤❤
Omg this made me cry, I love tanner and midge and jack 😊
This was awesome
Most of us trudge through life trying to find the smallest amount of joy this dude just experienced.
Jack was like *oh this is the most excited anyones ever been to meet me* and dude started cryyying 😭😭💙
Tanner its so amazing guys ❤
Great interaction
Jack black is such a sweetheart ❤❤😊
Now Jack Black (Po) knows what it was like for the Furious Five when he was fanboying over them!!
Tanner looks so much like a younger Mark Hamill
This is my favorite video!! I love the love that Tanner radiates! And I love seeing him so accepted and embraced by Jack and Kelly! These entertainers know they’ve got the power to make people’s day and choose to do so again and again! ❤ big hearts all around!
Autistic here, this is beautiful ☺
I'm totally watching Love on the Spectrum now. He seems so sweet too🥺
His breath all in his face 😭
Wow tv has gotten so bad please don’t put these nice people on tv. It’s not entertainment.
Tanner is an icon ❤
🥹🥹😍😍😍
Jack Black is a badass and the best American ever 💞💞💞🥰🥰🥰
I saw some of the Instagram Stories reposted by Tanner's account. Kelly's production team were also so kind and patient, high-fiving Tanner after the segment was over. Kudos!
i love this.
I love on the spectrum.I watch every one of them and it’s such a Great show!Love everyone on the shows.Looking for you Steve-handsome man

Tanner is so sweet and so is Jack Black. I’ve always had a huge crush on Jack Black and I’d probably be about this excited to meet him! His wife is a lucky woman.
Thats the best sweetest thing I've seen i have a daughter with autism and I love everything about my precious girl.  Hes amazing and so excited to see Jack but I would too.❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊
The fact that even in his special moment he still made the decision to introduce his whole family just made my soul smile
This is so adorable 😊😊😊 he was so excited 😊
Omg this is so heartwarming, you can see how genuinely excited he is. So much unbridled joy!!! ❤
I'd probably act just like that if I met Jack  Black....
I'm not crying you're crying
Zionist who cancelled his tour because he’s afraid of MAGATs.
I wanted Jack to just kiss him. Give him a big sloppy mouthing on tv.
The world is so blessed to have ppl like Tanner♥️
Jack Black was cancelled. No one cares about him
I need to know if Jack actually gave Tanner his number.  Tanner4life!
More of this please world. What a gorgeous group of humans. I’m grinning from ear to ear and my eyes have got a bit leaky!
Jack black remember A Minecraft Movie you did I watched it on Saturday I watched a Minecraft movie on Saturday the Dennis dog is so cute 🥰
I love u tanner ❤
I had no idea how much i needed to see this.. it's awesome!!
R e t a.           Rd
Very amazing! Kelly you look beautiful. I needed to see this bc my kids grew up with a best friend who always reminded us of Jack Black. He was full of life and so hilarious. We all loved him like a brother and son. He took his life at age 26 this year.  We have all been so heartbroken, especially my adult kids.  when I saw jack black here I realized we still have Jack Black with us to watch him grow old and keep us smiling and remembering our Joey.
KELLY..... YOU DID A GREAT THING!!!
As an autistic adult, this had me happy stimming so hard haha! So glad Tanner got to meet Jack :)
Tanner is the sweetest guy ❤
Some people really are angels sent to live amongst us ❤ he seems like a beam of light to the people in his life.
I thought they were gonna kiss for a sec
Sooooooooo sweet!!!!
Tanner is adorable..love him..
simple jack?
❤
People are different so we can see what pure joy is. Most of us stop experiencing it and forget. This was beautiful
❤ perfect.
The way he says “Yes ma’am.” PROTECT HIM AT ALL COSTS ❤️❤️❤️🥹🥹🥹 EDIT: also, protect Jack Black at all costs, he’s always seemed like just a cool and sweet dude.
YAS I LOVE THEM BOTH SM
This young man out here reading stories and helping kids dream on and in return one of his dreams came true
Tanner and Jack black should have a movie together
First time I’ve seen this Kelly person. PLEASE do not dance on your show… that was an Ellen thing, think of all the terrible horrors that woman has put people through, they don’t want reminding by your dancing.
What a lovely young man.  So glad he could meet one of his heroes. ❤️
It was awesome to see how excited he was.
He’s a Labrador retriever
I hope we all at some point get to feel as happy as Tanner does meeting Jack
OMG!!!!😂😢😢😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤
Jack Black is the best.
Jack needed this win after the Trump bs with Gass. Good to see him doing good
Literally crying cause this is so nice and sweet 😭
You can see jack is definitely not use to this but I am so happy to see how he handled it
God bless jack for letting tanner express his excitement all the way
Woah, did she say "all 80 of my first graders"? Do Americans have 80 kids in a classroom? Or is she a principal?
He said he is so handsome I almost melted.
Jack is the sweetest guy. I dont know him but his energy is just beautiful and the love he shows to all is wonderful. I am so glad they got to meet eachother. It's beautiful. And he couldn't be any sweeter if he tried. I love he is teaching little people how to love and appreciate everyone.
We are so starved of this emotional intelligence and vulnerability and can learn so much from Tanner!
Oh my gosh, can’t help but tear up. He has such a pure heart- it’s beautiful
Wow. I guess I have feelings after all.
Omg. He is so happy he can’t contain himself. ❤❤❤ it made me cry. So SO sweet.
Tanner is adorable!
I'm crying. So wonderful
Jack was so out of order in this interview.
POSITIVE energy indeed!
His joy is so inspiring ❤❤❤
This made me laugh and cry at the same time. Jack Black, that was so cool.
❤❤❤
Jack is so cool! Tanner rocks! This was so wonderful to watch.
Is jack going to finally come out this year?
If you want someone to find Jesus. Introduce them to an autistic person.
JB and KC our national treasures.
What a beautiful human Tanner is
Omg as a mom of kids on the spectrum I love that you& jack showed that these folks are like us just different too. I love how patient Jack was I would have been so touched out,  but he knew how excited he was. ❤❤❤❤❤❤
The subtitles lady just quit! I’m certain of that.
The world needs more Tanner. What a great dude.
So sweet
I dont like Tanner one bit. Just because someone has a disability, doesn't mean that they can't also be extremely annoying. His sister is also full of shit, in no world is there an 80 student kindergarten class.
Tanner reminds me of a happy dog except he can speak his mind it’s almost too pure
I love this clip.. I watched it so many times.. as a father of 2 special children, seeing the respect, love, and understanding of people like Kelly and Jack to Tanner just makes me so emotional.. You are one of the best Host Kelly, because you are also a genuinely good Person, and to Jack, I love you as an actor before and even love you more now as very cool person, for me you are now in line with Keanu Reeves and Adam Sandler as one of the most likable genuinely nice people in Hollywood.. Thank you for showing a very good example to the world on how to treat awesome people like Tanner.. God bless all of you..
I’m not crying. I’m not crying. I’m not cryinnnnng!! 😭😭😭
I cried the whole video 🥹
Love everything about this interview. My brother Jose has autism as well. He is a happy and sweet young man. I always appreciate people who treats him with love and respect . Thanks to Kelly and Jack .... You made Tanner's day!!!! I cried too much..
Kelly is so sweet. Love her. And gotta love jack. Doin the lords work haha
I’ve always ALWAYS loved Jack Black. What a great human being.
This is beyond beautiful.
if only every person on this planet was like Tanner then we could achieve true world love and peace <3
Plot twist, Tanner’s just acting
How can you not love Tanner?? What a special guy! ❤
I love Midge! Best sister ever! ❤
I’m not crying. You are!!
Hope the IMAX isn’t too overly stimulating lol
Love this 💜
❤
We need more Tanners and Jack Blacks in this planet
My respect for Jack black has raised even more
Kelly Clarkson is just one of the kindest, best people in the world! And for jack black just such a funny awesome man!  Best clip I have ever seen ❤ 🙏🏻 best happy vibes!
This is why I been a JB fan since 90s
Jack is a beautiful person.

Oh my heart I love this!!
The best" I am getting your phone number!"
I adore Tanner so much! I always have the biggest smile on my face whenever I see him!!! And his family is so lovely!

Tanner making a group hug is so sweet lol.
Jack Black is such a great human
There is so much joy here. It's overwhelming. I can't stop crying!
This is awesome.
Wonderful!
As a mom of two autistic kids,  can confirm that autistic kids have the most pure hearts ever! I can’t wait to see my kids grow and develop to the fullest!❤️ I wish to one day be able to have a full conversation with them but hearing Tannor talk, makes my heart melt!

pure joy on my screen aww. Jack has a golden heart
Jack black soo cool
This man has the best smile ever love his personality
This is so heart melting. Makes me so happy.
Were has Kelly disappeared too
Bro way too close for comfort… mom need to control this one before it gets outta hand
Someone said “Jack finally me someone with more energy the him”. Yes Yes and Yes 😂. I’ve never seen a Jack appearance with him not the energy in the scene 😅. So sweet❤
🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
Jack black literally worships satan so glad he was on the show
Tanner is so cute.
Jack is so nice, personally I'd be overwhelmed by someone being/speaking that close
I miss wide Kelly
Tanner is pure joy.  I understand the snow on Tanner's moms face.  As a fellow mom to an autistic son, to see you child this happy is so heartwarming ♥️
I met Jacob. ❤ Hilton BWI….  He took my heart.  He told me all about his day.
Love
Hello, Humans When your hopes and dreams are ruined, or taken away from you, find a better path. There's always a path that will shake the foundation of the original.  TERRANCE OUT
So awesomely, awkwardly, wholesome.
Love tanner energy bro ❤
Yo Jack...trust me, not shaming you man really.  But, you've doubled in size since Nacho Libre.  Please dude...starting to worry about you, even though you DO seem to be living your best life.  Bro, get it together.  Hope there are no addictions.
Omg this is so wholesome 😂❤
🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
Crazy moments my whole life
Thank you. I’m crying. That’s so beautiful!
For a moment I thought he was gonna kiss him 😂, ❤
Oh my gosh, than you for giving Tanner a platform to appear on for press. This was so nice. I loved it. My daughter had autism and, idk, this got me right in the feelings 💖 Thanks team Jack Black
Aren’t you glad President Trump is gutting funding and services for people with disabilities?!  These people do not deserve any sort of support. MAGA!!  [I didn’t vote for the Orange Idiot]
This warms my soul we have to protect Jack Black and Kelly
Everything about this is beautiful ❤️😭
Omg that is so incredibly sweet. God love!!!
Jack Black for President
Tanner is such a amazing soul.. keep up the good work tanner
I'm in tears. This is just beautiful. Tanner Smith's capacity for sheer joy is just wonderful to witness. Jack Black matches the energy beautifully, gracious and real.
this made me sob
Omg I wanna cry. This is so beautiful. Kelly you're the best. ❤
This is precious 😊😊😊
So special...what a lovely man
Omg so sweet!!! You know everything he says is just so genuine!!
That’s the best❤
That was so sweet
As a person as well with high functioning autism and adhd I could definitely tell you that kids love us. I have worked with kids before and they always think you’re the coolest person because they see something in you than them seeing a typical neurotypical person with no disability. Kids don’t see us as a disability which comes from their innocents. And us neurodivergents happen to have a lot innocents and new curiosity about the world like children do. It’s a beautiful chemistry I can tell you that. I know, deep down, I can’t have children. But working with them is what matters most to me.
I think I’ve watched this a minimum of 15 times omggggggggggg im crying
❤❤❤❤❤
My 5 year nephew is on the spectrum and non verbal and these kinda of actions just prove what I already know. He’s an amazing little man!! Great job Kelly
😢omg ❤❤❤
Jack has been one of my favs since Nacho Libre but this just made him my favorite actor 😊. Thank you Jack.
❤
Oh , how sweet!
Johnny Knoxville played him in a movie
I love Tanner! I love Mr Black! My cheeks hurt, im smiling so big!! 😁😁😁😁
Best happy tears moment, ever! 🫶🏻
What a blessed moment!!❤ thank you for making that happen Kelly  !!! Huggs and could feeeel the genuine love and happiness ❤❤❤
Caution: Wholesome Content!
I can’t believe he name dropping Zach like that.
This was the cutest thing ever
Dude.. I’m a 35 year old man, and I can’t imagine how good it must feel to get that admiration from somebody. Tanner seems like a real blessing to anyone around him.
This is precious ❤
Tanner is everyone’s Golden Retriever. Dude is pure love 😅
I think BJ was about to cry of happiness and love.❤
We all need a sweet happy Tanner in our lives  The pure heart joy is therapeutic
Ofcourse this clown is going to be a suck up after he made a joke about the bullet missing trump lol.. I remember youse all wanted him cancelled and gone but now a few months go by and it’s all Gravy like nothing happened.. hahah youse are the real sheeples of the state. Forget and forgive.
Such a great kid🥺
Tanner has really come a long way since I first saw him on Special Books by Special Kids (SBSK for short)! I cannot believe he got to meet Jack Black on the Kelly Clarkson show!
Best video ever
I am a grown ass man with a beard and im 6 ' 3" and this video made my cry like a sissy boy....loved it but i hated the fact i cried!
Jack Black is such a good human. Thought I could not love him more, but after seeing this I have to say I do. 💗😭
This made me cry 😢😌😀
Tanner is just overflowing with love. Wow, so cool to see it embraced
Jack Black is a really good man.
This is amazing 😭😂
I felt genuinely distraught when the last episode of this new season of love on the spectrum ended. It’s my favorite reality show because it’s the most authentic, 100%. I love Tanner and the whole gang on the show. This brought me to tears!
Everything Tanner says and does is 100% authentic and real... This interaction was truly, truly fantastic to witness ❤️ I couldn't stop crying 🖤
I love him!
Jack Black advocates for Autism Speaks which seeks to "cure" Autism and they vilify tf out of it. Super gross.
This is the most pure and precious thing ever. I love everything about this ❤❤😂😂
I love this so much❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Mom of autistic person as well, crying tears of joy.  Thank u, Kelly and your team for shining a light on this beautiful moment!!❤❤
Much respect for Jack on being cool
More more more Love on the Spectrum. The world needs more of this purity. Kudos, Kelly!
He's soooooo sweet!
I’m in FLOODS watching this 💌
I love the way he introduced his sister and other family members to Jake. So sweet and courteous.
MY SHAYLAAAA!!!! I love tanner so much bro ❤❤❤
As an autism mom I’m bawling but as a human…. So grateful we are so grateful and kind about core
Feel like he wanted to give him a kiss but restrained himself, what a beautiful human being ❤
jack! it's you!
tanner is so damn charming lol
Now I’m just sitting here crying this is beautiful ❤❤❤
My whole entire BEING is smiling!!!!… everyone on that stage is just so great ❤ my goodness ❤
Tanner whispering to Jack he’s going to get his number so they can work out was a boss move.
I'm welling up watching this..thank you Kelly..Tanner your a star ⭐⭐⭐
I love Tanner & the show. He’s a great guy. Love Jack Black & Kelly 🫶
The smile on Jacks face when he was hugging Tanner😢❤
As sweet as Tanner is, my personal space could never.
This made my day! 😃
this is so cute omg
Aw Tanner is my fav!
3:50 omg 😢😢🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂😂 that has to be on top of Jack's favorite moment with a die hard fan. He might be a little hard of hearing after this too lol. Tanner was loving life
AMAZING! Spread love 💕
Two beautiful men 😊
His sister 's response when she turns to Kelly
This kid is awesome. Jack Black is a nation treasure who needs to be protected at all costs
Dude is so pure 😂 i hope jack gave him his number and they lift weights together
I just love his laugh I can listen to him laugh and talk all day! what a joy he brings to the world. This would be my reaction if I met Tanner in person.
As someone who has a good friend similar to Tanner it takes a special person to hang with these kids.  Kudos to Jack and Kelly ❤
Jack Blacks heart man!!! Tanner is awesome! This is awesome to watch 🥹🥹
Hahaha “guess what I’m going to get your phone number and we can work out together”
Ahhhh yay Tanner he’s so happy
He is adorable and contagious 😊
Jack black is a sell out
Am i the only person that wants tanners energy.
I love Jack Black. He's geniune and unapologetically himself.
I love how many times he says Jack's name. It is such a beautiful gesture of love--that repeated recognition of someone. Tanner is the best!!
This entire interview had me misty eyed. Its so beautiful to see Tanner be treated with dignity and respect.
As a mom with a son on the spectrum, this made my heart so full and happy.
So wholesome
I'M IN TEARS!!!!!💙💙💙💙
Jack Black is a good sport. This was awesome!😊
I love him omg
80 first graders!? Good lawd woman!
Tanner is just like Drew barrymore lmao
I’d react the same way to jack black Ngl
Someone's a "close-talker".
Aww.. im crying
Oh too bad, he's not as cool now.
Tears. 😂 omg.  So fabulous wonderful.  D.E.I. is so important 😊
Jack Black is. Awesome!!
2 weirdos
Tanners energy made Jacks energy self destruct. XD
That’s so awesome
Jack Black you are so kind & sweet❤
Omg 80 kids in a class. What the shit
Tanner got my attention several years ago when he and his college roommate (who has Down Syndrome) were featured on the YouTube video series Special Books by Special Kids. His smile is infectious!!
His excitement was so wholesome
Now I need to clean all this overflowing positivity that spilled all over the room....
Two amazing human beings. <3
This is so wholesome. I love Jack 10x more for his kind heart to our happiest people on this earth ❤❤
I just cried lol
not me absolutely bursting into tears.....
As if I could love jack black any more than I already do 😂 and Tanner’s enthusiasm hits you like a freight train I’m obsessed.
My heart is literally melting! Such a beautiful moment!
Gotta love it how sweet of Kelly and Jack what great Humans
The way I cried for a complete stranger 😭😭😭😍😍🥹🥹🥰🥰🥰
Cried the entire episode
This is the most wholesome and beautiful moment I’ve seen. It made my heart swell with joy for Tanner. Jack Black is a class act, and I’m so thankful to Kelly Clarkson for setting up this meeting and giving Tanner the chance to meet his real-life hero.
❤
His family tearing up at his joy 🥹🥹🥹
As an autistic woman, I would like to put out that Jack Black has been over the years an advocate for Autism Speaks, which sees Autism as something to cure rather than accept.
So sweet
That was amazing!😅
Tanner's smile is so contagious
Oh my heart....
Bet this made jack's day
So heartwarming xx
My God this was beautiful♥
The more I watch tanner the more I question if this is real. No hate. Just I have trust issues 😂
Class Act Jack Black! Just made my cynical heart melt. ❤
I was getting anxious watching how close Tanner was to Jack's face. So, I know I'd panic had it been me. 😅
Tanner, thank you ❤, you have made my year!!!!
Omgg my heart melts ❤
I’m 60 and on the spectrum too. I’m bawling my eyes out because Tanner knows the enthusiasm I feel when I have something special happen(like when I met Jack Blades of Night Ranger.)  You’re a hero to me Tanner!
I’ve always wondered if Jack was on the spectrum too ❤
I love tanner he’s such a bright light! ❤😂🎉
This was so awesome this kids energy outdid jacks lol even he was like wtf this kid won my energy hahaha
No one sweeter than Jack Black for this young man to meet 🥲
Tanner is incredible. Love
This is so sweet.
Tanner is awesome he is supper positive all the time love people like that 👍🏼
Omg I teared up this entire video. So pure and genuine to see ❤
Why am I crying watching this??  Such a beautiful moment.
He’s definitely gonna have something to tell his dates now he met Jack Black
I love Tanner so much and his sister is also an incredibly wonderful person. Good job mom!!
💙 the joy from Tanner!!!
tanner is genuinely so sweet, the speed in which he introduced his family 😭😭😭
Is he faking? Not casting shade, just a real opinion on an observation. I mean, I could mimic that... O_O
Okay this made me cry! Absolutely sweet and I love the way Jack Black embraced his hugs and excitement🥹❤
Jack probably got flash backs of tropic thunder.
Who cutting onions in here? 😭 He’s so pure hearted. I would fight for him.
Love Jack Black even more after this interaction. ❤
LOVEEEEEE❤
My son is 21 and autistic. This was really nice to see. I used to be afraid for his future but now I'm just excited to see whats in store for him. Also, this was awesome. Im so happy for him and this moment❤

Ok it worked. Imma go see Minecraft now. Damn you Jack Black you beautiful human being you.
It's so beautiful and wonderful. But this is the first video I noticed when Kelly Clarkson talks on certain syllables her little mouth makes a heart shape! She just can't get any cuter.
This is so wholesome and good.
I was holding it together until I saw Tanner's brother crying in the stands. God bless Jack Black and Tanner.
It would be awesome if Jack Black was able to have Tanner in a Kung Fu Panda movie.

My son, wants to grow up to work at a hotel. He’s autistic as well.

When he says yes ma'am to Kelly just make me smile with happiness 🤗 And this is what TRUE kind, sweet, innocence look like.
Kelly, I am so glad to see this. I have such huge respect for you. Thank you for bringing my autism to the mainstream. ❤❤❤❤
I don't cry much, but when I do, it's watching Jack and Kelly be amazing human beings to the humans who have traditionally been left behind.
He tired jack out haha
Jack black proves him self over and over again that he's honestly one of the most amazing people in hoilday. he's treated him with such kindness thats never seen by celebrities
Beautiful 🥰
Wow Kelly looks great
plot twist the real actor is not jack black
Is Kelly another one on this Ozempic?
This is the biggest like I’ve ever given
Crying and I don’t easily cry 😭
Jack is way nicer than myself.   The entire show of love on the spectrum is wild to me.
Omgggg! This one got me good! 😍🥹  As an RBT who works with children on the spectrum, this video just gave me sooo much joy! His reaction was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen!
beautiful ! I love Jack Black ❤️🇨🇦🇬🇧🇺🇦🏳️‍🌈
He is very sad
this is one of my favorite interviews ever, absolutely just made my day
The world needs more Tanners! 😊
Jack is the man 🥰 and I wish the entire world was as happy and positive as Tanner ❤️
I watch Love On The Spectrum  and Tanner is one of my favorites.  This just made me ugly cry. I'm so happy for him
I’m not crying YOU ARE
this is so cute
Am I the only one crying 😢 😊
Love Tanner❤and Jack. You’re awesome having him on the show Kelly.
As an autistic person, this is so touching: ❤
This is the best news of the entire year
Why am I crying??????
Well. I know I started crying..Wbu?
I just burst into tears. This is beautiful and wholesome. Thank you to everyone who makes Tanner happy.
😂❤❤❤❤❤ oh my gosh I literally cried happy tears
What an amazing, polite individual!!!  He’s kind, articulate, and just has pure joy of life!!!  Best thing I have seen in a very long time!!!!!!
The surprise is that Jack Black wasn't on coke that morning.
I’m sobbing at him meeting jack! “Jack it’s you!” The cutest thing I’ve ever seen 🥹
He is melting my heart ♥️ you can tell he has a pure spirit omg I just love is whole personality. You can definitely see that he lights up any room he walks into. And looks like he has a great supportive family.🥰
I love that he introduced Jack to his sister. What a god damn sweetheart ❤
This is so wholesome
“guess what jack, im going to get your phone number” that was so funny i love tannwr
I would react the same way meeting Jack.  Love Tanner.  He is a bright light on this earth.
SAAAAAAUUUUURRRRRRR CCCCUUUUUUTTTTTTEEEEEE!!! warms my heart
Love love love this!!
🥲
I love him.  I never had more love for anyone that I never knew.  He’s a special person, so pure of heart.  His family is lucky to have him.  Tanner may you continued to be blessed spread your positivity.
❤As an educator who works with children on the spectrum, this is heartwarming😊
I’m not crying you’re crying ❤
Why am I tearing up 😂❤
BEST EPISODE EVER ❤❤❤
Pure joy, pure kindness. We all need to be like Tanner.
This is why Diversity Equity and Inclusion matters, never let the media convince you otherwise.
I cry every single time I watch this!! Tanner is such a gem of a human! So glad Jack could make his dream come true!
😭 had me in happy tears! The PURE joy in his voice and his being!!! ❤
What if he was just acting like he has autism
This is so amazing Kelly.  Makes you smile. Jack Black is an absolute legend,   PS miss your music  Kelly.
I still don’t like Jack Black. this is all an act
I was a support worker for 8 years for people with disabilities and brain damage. It never felt like work. That’s when I learned that I didn’t need to be loved as much as I needed to love others…that’s happiness.
Im not crying
The little boy has so much respect for everyone
Tanner is so wholesome 😊😊
Spoiler; Tanner is faking it
I’m not crying someone cut an onion or something 😭
Bless Jack Black's sweet heart for being so lovely and respectful while having such an excited young man in his personal space speaking so loudly!  I love Jack so much more after seeing this and much respect for Kelly and the team for making this happen and including the education on stimming.  ❤❤❤
Jack is the man!
55 years old Jack Black 53 years old wife Tanya Haden M  2006
Love Tanner and love that he got to meet Jack Black, so exciting. What an amazing young man he is.
Tanner is incredible, got such a massive personality
Omg this is the like the best moment ever.
WE NEED THIS SO MUCH RIGHT NOW! Just Love!
I don't get the context, someone explain.
Always liked Jack but this is a new respect for him. I volunteered in High school with kids that had autism and Down syndrome, to be able to keep your cool and treat them with the same respect and have a conversation with them while they are 1” from your face is difficult it’s not something people normally do, for jack to embrace it and not get flustered in front of all those people is great! Giving Tanner something he’ll never forget.
Who is the woman next to Tanner?
I’m so happy for you Tanner, our polite sir finally met his hero🥹♥️
Somebody make a movie about a golden retrievers soul getting transferred into a human being and have tanner be the star!
That one time , when you met your idol, and it was AWESOME!! I just love them both.
LOVE
Tanner’s happiness is so infectious!
And to think this administration wants to defund education and non profits that helps kids and adults on the spectrum.. These people deserve the world. My life is so much fuller being able to work with adults on the spectrum and I wouldn't trade it for anything 😭
the sweetest performance on The Kelly Clarkson Show, I'm happy in my tears, happy for you Tanner
How can you watch this and feel nothing but pure joy?! The best!
Im crying so much this is so beautiful
I'm crying 😢😢😢 Happy tears Bless him 🙏
Hello, Humans Be careful who you trust, because most humans don't care about your well being.  TERRANCE OUT
I'm crying 😭
Hes the sweetwst thing ever and hes sister is gorgeous
Jack black is such a good bloke. And he seems so authentically himself. Like he geeks over what he wants to geek about without a care what anyone else thinks about it and wouldn't be successful had he not
Kelly is just amazing❤
I'm in tears. So happy for Tanner!! Way to go Jack Black 🥹
I love Tanner
Tanner is everything wonderful in the world.. he is such a beautiful pure heart..
I wish I could look at life each day the way Tanner does. He is truly amazing! Jack is so awesome…I bet he did give him his number so they could keep in touch.
Amazing
Im sorry. But I'm gonna say it...the dude is faking it.  He sold you all.  Anyone who has a child on the spectrum will understand and know.   He's fake
I have always loved Jack and this is making me cry 😭😭😭
I can’t wait for tanner to get into voice acting and be in movies with Jack! His energy would light up any movie for kids and family to enjoy
I love this!!! Jack Black is an amazing human!!!!! How amazing to be someone’s hero like that. He’s awesome and Tanner too!
U know he was spitting all in his face lol
Kelly looks great im happy for her
This is the most wholesome thing I’ve seen in a long while. Love everything about this! Tanner and his new friend Jack are amazing!! Well done Kelly!!
I love how he points out his entire family to Jack so sweet
I love this
I love him so honest so pure so wonderfully human
Jack and tanner need to do a film together
Awesome ❤
Near the end Jack's like, alright, this actor is doing too much.
I just hope tanner had fresh breathe with how close he got to Jack's face
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
PURE JOY
I can’t get over how much him and his sister look alike !! Same expressions and everything
when two rays of sunshine meet!!! 😍
This is the best. I cried. 🥹
I’m sad! I’m soo worried Kelly is not happy anymore and this is now just a job for her. While Jack hasn’t been the same (imo) since he broke up with his buddy fro tenatious D.. if he really wanted to do something nice for this kid, why wait until you have to do so to promote your movie… he lost his humility imo… I hope they both get out of the matrix ASAP
Tanner might be the best person on the planet
Tanner is the best ❤ My adult son is on the spectrum too and it’s the little things in life…
Omg that was o amazing he his love ❤️ he pure heart is everything
Ok Kelly (looking fire with less makeup on ❤) the raddest person with Tanner the most enthusiastic and sweet person with Jack Black the funniest coolest person 🤯 I love this clip!!
Sooooo cute! I definitely teared up. I wish him nothing but success.
I love Jack Black! He's a class act!
I’m not crying, you’re crying
He was so happy that’s so sweet
Jack black is such a good human being
Tanner ❤❤❤❤❤
Just finished season 3 ❤
Who else on here has a crush on Mr Tanner?   What a gem of a good man.  We love you Tanner all the way from California to now in Texas!!  Keep being amazing😊❤

I love Jaxk Black.
We all should be a bit like Tanner what a amazing guy💕
Gah Lee I needed this today. Ty jack and tanner
Who's cutting onions?
Kelly’s been eating ozempic like they’re skittles and it shows
You'd need to mash up Jack Black and Robin Williams to end up with Tanner's energy and positivity
Jack Black is the kindest soul! Love Tanner's personality.
Imagine being loved like that ...
Miss Kelly 😭
This made me so happy. Seeing someone just be so excited and happy to see another person absolutely warmed my heart…honestly all we need is love. God protect and bless Tanner & his family.
We haven't forgotten what you did to your boy, Jack.
Tanner  is awesome

Jack black is my goat
Loved all the energy around this meeting between Jack And Tanner. Such a great meeting and moment.
Love that Tanner skipped the whole crowd over to point out his Mom in the crowd to meet/see Jack Black.
I have watched this like over 10 times this morning. This is great.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
When the world needed his positivity and enthusiasm the most, tanner returned
Omg made me cry hes sooo happy i love it

Man jack black is bowser and Steve he will never have peace now lol
Im so glad Jack is a nice guy. He was so sweet and kind to tanner. It can be difficult for ppl to have others in their space sometimes, even if they are being sweet like tanner. ❤
So this dude basically a golden retriever in human form.
I love this so much!!! I'm so happy Tanner came back to the show, and I'm so happy Jack was there to say hello! I know this was such a big deal and i hope Tanner does get Jack's number and they work out together hahaha 😂❤
Tanner, a close talker
CHICKEN JOCKEY!!!
I cant believe jack black got the chance to meet Tanner !! 🤗
Why did this make me cry!?

As a father of two autistic children this is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
I’m over here bawling my eyes out! omggg so wholesome. ❤
Dude, it seems like Jack Black was totally in awe with this young man 😅 Like he was processing the emotion of admiration Tanner has for him , straight up made me tear up HARD 😆😁😄🤭🤗🤗🥰🥰🥰 HE IS THE BEST!!!
I'm not crying.. YOU'RE crying!!!  Ohhh, I just love Tanner so much.  He makes me so happy, every time I get to see him. What an incredible moment for him!

Both Jack and Kelly must be two of the nicest celebs ever!

i’m not a big jack black fan but this was super sweet
YOUVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME! THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER!!!!!
As a mom of an Autistic 19 year old, the way this entire interview went has brought me to tears! There is so much love, and inclusion! Tanner, and all Autistic peoples, deserve to be treated with dignity and like anyone else you would meet! Kelly did that. And for Jack to be so cool and loving, I just couldn’t handle it. I hope my son finds joy and acceptance like this in his lifetime.
I cannot watch this, I am gonna cry.
Who is this beautiful angel!!!!??? I'm so in love!!!
Aww I love this
This is beyond PURE! It’s absolutely beautiful! ❤
This is why I will always support jack black!
Love this so so much ❤
Props to Jack for handling the no personal space 🎉
When he said “thank you mrs kelly this is the best day of my life!” 😂 god love him.
He is so kind and genuine. I'm loving the "yes ma'ams". So respectful as well! Good job mom!
My is daughter is 7 with autism and is mostly non verbal. This episode has me in tears!! HAPPY tears!
my heart.

This is the sweetest thing ever broadcasted on TV ❤
Tanner is pure joy!
Im CRYIIIIING
Tanner is a golden retriever 100%
Tanner, you'll never forget this moment .. ..😊😊😊😊😊😊..
To see Jack give his compassion to him is just amazing. He just made that gentleman's life. As a mama who has a little boy with autism, this makes me cry. To see him being treated like a normal person and how polite Tanner is just made my mama heart burst.
As soon as they embraced I cried.
Jack Black is one of a kind!!
Tanner always making me cry like a baby, so preciousss 😭
How can anyone not smile when you see him? He just makes me smile.
His sister is a fabulous caregiver

I think Jack Black is in awe of his high energy 😂
This brought tears to my eyes! So wholesome and sweet.
Tanner is mounting Black lmao
Noo. Dont put a clip of the video before the video. That makes no sense.
Jack was THRILLED with his reaction. That was precious.
This is the best thing I’ve seen 🎉
Tanner is the absolute sweetest! That picture they showed of him reading to a classroom was my child’s class. She absolutely loved his visit and couldn’t stop talking about him. She also has special needs and I just love seeing people treat others with kindness and respect no matter their differences! Also, my daughter and her twin’s hero is Kelly Clarkson. They are literally obsessed and don’t know it yet but are finally going to see her in concert in May! We are making the 13 hour drive to make their dream come true and I can’t wait to see their faces when they find out! I tear up just thinking about it!!! Thank you for the light and love you spread, Kelly and Tanner!
This was so touching!  How awesome!
Tanner is such a sweetheart
I LOOOOOOOOVE jack black. Tanner's reaction is so valid.  He's definitely how I'd feel on the inside if i ever got to meet him.  He's like everyone's big brother or dad. Just the coolest, chillest, down to earth dude in hollywood. Not to mention also super talented.  Musically,  funny, great acting,  great personality and just command a room with his awesomeness. Rare to find a specimen like jack black anywhere in Hollywood nowadays.
This was awesome, guys!
“Yes sir!” 😂😂❤️❤️
🥰 AWWWWW!!! 🥰
I only came here to see Tanner his so cute and sweet. F-u-c-k Jack Black he is a bad influencer who told his fans pretty much to summarize to hurt others because of his Democrat party against Trump.
Awwww 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥲
MR. Jack Black keep your Heart filling with the goodness you always had.
Such a great moment! Kelly & Jack are both just the best!
Jack Black is the best to all his fans - So happy for tanner!!!
This is what pure joy and happiness looks like. I needed to see this! So beautiful ❤
I have a kiddo who has some challenges and we have certainly gone through some ups and downs. This is a great reminder that there is room for all of us in this world and if we could all manage just a little more kindness and grace we could have better connections with our fellow humans. This was very heartwarming to watch. I’ve always loved Kelly and Jack Black- this shows their true character.
Kelly Clarkson you are a beautiful soul!  Tanner ….. you are incredibly inspiring!  JACK BLACK …. I REALLY BELIEVE YOU ARE A LIVING ANGEL ! THANK YOU JACK!
Am not crying. You are
Tanner's such a sweetheart and I love Jack! ❤ This is the best video ever!!!
I’m not crying, you are…..😢😢😢😢😢
OMG laughed and cried...life isn't all bad sometimes. Thanks for showing us  humanity is not dead😢😊
Oh this brings so much joy to my heart ❤❤❤ thank u so much Kelly for & Jack for letting Tanner express his emotions & just the joy u brought him xoxo from an ASD Mumma this brings me so much joy & hope for my boy in the future ❤❤
Bless Jack Black's sweet heart for being so lovely and respectful while having such an excited young man in his personal space speaking so loudly!  I love Jack so much more after seeing this and much respect for Kelly and the team for making this happen and including the education on stimming.  ❤❤❤
Some people are truly too pure for this world. Absolutely adorable 🥹🥹
This is absolutely amazing! 🥹 Tanner is so polite, considerate, friendly and positive. We need more Tanners in the world. ❤ I'm so happy for him thst he got to meet his hero. Jack Black is such a genuinely lovely person too.  The world needs more moments like this. ❤❤❤
So wholesome. ❤❤
He's such a sweetie lol 😂😂❤❤❤
OH MY F’N GOSH!!!!! Hahahahaha this is literally the most adorable thing I have ever seen in my life! He was SOOOOOO close to jack’s face and Jack didn’t move away or show a oz of “ok ok slow down” or anything hahahahha just wow
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is too much for the heart to take in one sitting! I am WRECKED!!! 😭😭😭
Omg we need to 100 percent protect this man at all costs!!!!
That was beautiful !🥲the sweetest thing ever✌️💚🤩
I was trying so hard not to cry 😢. But I failed so hard 😢
I love it
Wow this made me so happy
I'm crying happy tears. As a mom of a boy who is also in the spectrum. That genuine happiness is such a gift to see. 🥹🥹🥹
I swear I can’t watch anything having to do with this show without crying
This is great. I love Tanner. He's a ball of sunshine.
I’ve always liked Jack Black but this just skyrocketed my opinion of him as a human being. He hugged him over and over, treated him with respect and showed no indifference to his closeness. ❤❤❤❤
💜💜💜
Absolutely love Tanner, he's so positive and polite I hope he finds his future lady. Him meeting Jack Black is awesome his genuine excitement is precious. "You're so handsome! We can workout together. " 😂
An amazing man.
that was awesome 😄
Jack black is the best
yeeeeeeeeeeeees
Jack’s own family is not excited to see him as Tanner guy 😂
Jack is also Autistic, so he completely understands how Tanner reacts and acts.   Bless everyone in this video.
TEARS JUST TEARS 😭
💗💗💗💗
I would like to mention how much I respect Tanner’s boss. I know people on the spectrum can face discrimination in the workforce so it’s really cool that he hires how he does. You can also tell he’s a good boss by how Tanner seemed to truly appreciate him.
This is GOLD!!! Two of my favorite humans! Jack and Tanner! Kelly you have to put them together more often! Lifting weights, etc! Gold!
❤️😀😀This is so heartwarming , absolutely beautiful....between Tanner & Jack...
The families on Love On The Spectrum are some of the sweetest. Seriously— if you haven’t seen this show, it’s one of the most pure forms of joy you will watch. ❤
Awww im just bawling!!!😭😭😭😭
Jack Black is all, i am getting tired. This one has more energy than me. Must calm down soon!  For the first time, I witnessed Jack Black become almost silent and calm from a fireball level energy. 😂🤣
Hes so pure.. innocent omg damn why i crying again?? The burst of happiness is overwhelming
Look how happy he is omg so sweet
This was the best part of my day.❤😊
Tanner is the human equivalent to a golden retriever! Absolutely adorable! Super excitable and just happy to be here! Not to mention he radiates love and kindness. ❤
“This is the best day of my life”
I am in tears happy emotional ones this young man I’ve never heard of him till this moment and he is the sweetest you guys really surprised him so glad you did our youngest a special needs and he will be 28 years old this year he may be nonverbal at times, but he understands simple things🩷🎀💕🕊️🙏🕊️
“We’re busy guys, aren’t we Jack?” Was so funny and sweet all at once
I'm crying and laughing at the same time. Great video!
My words will never express what I feel and I'm sure no one will ever read this but I have to say it anyway.  From the age of 10 years old, I idolized Kelly Clarkson and Jack Black. I'm talking one, two, done. My mom asked me who I'd rather meet - Kelly or Jack - and it triggered my fight or flight lol  I saw Kelly win American Idol. I'm a singer myself and she's always been my #1. Around that same time, my older brother introduced me to Tenacious D. I remember performing a theatrical a capella rendition of "Tribute" on the playground in 6th grade to entertain my friends and teachers.   I've never gotten to see Kelly live but I did get to see Jack and Kyle in concert in New Orleans in early 2020 and touch Jack's hand.   Everyone close to me (and even those not so close to me) know this about me and several people have already sent me this video.   I am not autistic but I am neurodivergent (gifted and ADHD) and these 2 artists/performers shaped me more than they'll ever know.  I recently watched Love On The Spectrum and to see them with Tanner like this... it reinforces everything they made me feel growing up, and still do.   I'm so thankful for this moment and for people like Kelly and Jack who use their gifts to make others feel loved, special, valued, and seen.
valid reaction jack black is such an icon
YA JACK YES JACK ❤️ Your the best jack 😂❤️
this needs to be trending ! 😢
Omg im crying 😢so sweet
Love Tanner so much!!
omg i was smiling ear to ear my cheeks hurt, tanner is such a bright light ❤
love this! You can FEEL the neurons firing off in Tanners brain/body LOL
Oh my god I don’t think a video has ever touched my heart more. This is such a cruel world; but stuff like this reminds me that there are endless possibilities for the neurodivergent little kids that I work with every day
The world needs more moments like this.
Tanner!  ❤
3:15
I’m sobbing ❤
I needed that soooo much
Thank you Tanner for all the smiles and happy tears. This is what we need more of!
You know, sometimes when it's hard to think of why God would make different people in different parts of the spectrum, you just have to watch things like this. A "normal" person would try to play it cool and be socially acceptable polite but just look at the unabashed and unfiltered joy that comes out of this man. And the smile he puts on Jack's face. So happy for him! This totally made my day
I love Jack more than ever after seeing this! BIG BEAR HUG!
I already know this video is about to make me SOB lmao
He's going to talk about nothing else for at least 5 years! 😅 Kudos to Jack and Kelly
Jack Black and Kelly should sing together!

OMG. I just cried so much watching this beautiful video. I'm overjoyed for Tanner meeting his hero. Kudos to Jack Black and Kelly Clarkson for embracing this extraordinary human being and accepting him for the superstar he truly is. ❤
His happiness makes me cry every time. I’m just so happy for him. Thank you so much for doing this 🥹
Please, please notice that Kelly isn't speaking down to Tanner at all. Just a regular conversation with any adult guest.
