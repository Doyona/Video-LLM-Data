Hey ann stephens
👽 head alien look fun magic crash driver police
Said me look bad you teacher post at this name Temu
Police said me look you back you policewoman
Said me look bad crime woman issuel
I keep getting calls about the police officers asking for donations 😂. I'm pretty tired of it
They have done this to me. Empty threats in an Indian accent...lol.
I always play along with them and give them random made up info etc…or talk like I’m a looney person and it encourages them to hang up or I ask them to remove me from their SCAM list before they need an ambulance😂
This is Hilarious. 😅
Scanmers don't care about anyone and will scam everyone and anyone. Good job, captain.
I love it when these morons say that an arrest warrant has to issued ON your name.  I ask if they need directions to my house. They wouldn't find it otherwise!
The scammer's accent says everything you need to know.
Don't "just hang up" as I've hang up on a call much like this and it turns out real cops get angry when you hang up on them when they're asking for your address so that they can come and arrest you. Thankfully they found their own paperwork which showed that my car, that I legally owned, was not stolen. So happy ending in my case.
I’ve seen this captain officer before I love what she does
I dont doubt she sells drugs tbh.
India  biggest  business with government backup to draw money  to India  no matter how they do it ,  too many  of those business  with big buildings and thousands  of scamming employees
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂
This is hillarious! 😂😂😂
I got scammed  5year  ago  give out everything 😂😂😂
Jesus Only Believe Jesus Only Jesus will get the scammers.
You couldn't have played the role anymore than you did. Good on you. I hope you get this criminal and lock him up.
you love nead  ❤❤❤❤❤
hallo 119 love
She should act a little scared. She should offer him some of the drugs.
The cutest "duh" moment ever 😂
I should join the fbi just to mess with scammers 😂
Absolutely.🤣🤣🤣 India police officer.😝😝😝
She should have given him dome of the info he was asking like, her address at the sherriffs office and her name and title.
They make it sound like it’s a mass murder they way he talks
The scammer will always have the upper hand as long as the only thing even a police captain can do is keep them on the line so people will see how far they will go to scare you. It is so depressing to know that in this time of so much advancement in technology, that this reprehensible behavior  continues to flourish with no consequence. That is shocking.
I've got these kind of calls too
When my mom gets these calls I pick up and scream into the phone then hang up. Same with my phone too cuz I get scam calls even tho I’m only a pre teen.
This happened to my mother and the scammer told her that if she didn't cooperate then she would be raped. Definitely called the FBI abt that one!
Pretty scary what these scammers can do!!! I had someone call me and they made my bank’s phone number come up on my caller id…
My uncle would always get mad when my grandma would get these, and he got so fed up one day he answered the. Phone and placed a pan over it, he started banging on it yelling “don’t ever talk to my mom ever again!”😭
absolutly
I literally had this happen to me before, guy called me and told me they found my car all the way in Louisiana with 🧱 inside it & told me that the sheriff would come arrest me all the way in Philadelphia… I never been to Louisiana a day in my life 😂
☝️💪✊🧐🇺🇲🧐🤣
🎥🎤🎥
We all enjoy a good chat with an Indian accent.
Hero in uniform 😊
This is the most dumbest scammer I’ve ever seen.😂😂😂
When I was young, about 19. Already married with 2 children and we had our own house. I had received one of these calls and at first I believed him. I had never been in any kind of trouble and I didn't know how the law worked. That's where they get young and old people, people who have never been in trouble and don't know how the law works. Back to the story, I think I gave out my birthday but the same as this officer said, I started to realize that if he is who he says he should know my name, my I formation, etc. I then realized that he had no idea who or where I am and I hang up. He tried to call back several times but without me answering he eventually stopped. I also had a call about my Amazon account that someone used for $2,000. What was funny was that I never used Amazon and I had no credit cards or anything. I quickly knew that was a scam. My husband almost got scammed by the new UPS scam about a package being held, pay like 39¢ to receive your package, luckily I had called him and told him I had my package right before he put in the information. Now my husband has received two wrong number text with women who have been very pushy trying to flirt and make friends with him. Luckily he is a faithful man and showed me the texts, that's when I was informed about the wrong number text scam. You have to be very careful, please do not fall for all these scams. Inform your families about the scams and what to watch out for.
64 calls... Swinging rope.
I’m surprised the police Captain didn’t call in one of those tech teams to try and triangulate the call… Maybe, I need to stop watching Law & Order & CSI lol 🤷🏾‍♂️🤣
I prefer to lead them on for a bit.  False information is the way to go.
Would’ve liked to hear his reaction once told he was talking with the police.
Every time I see this video I laugh
Beware of the voice that is foreign!!
They tried to do that with my taxes but the thing is I knew I paid my taxes every  year
Ose 🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾
So sweet ❤️ 😎👊🏾🫶🏾🦅🐦‍🔥🌎😎😎😎
How did it end?
Wow a clip from years and years ago that everyone thinks is new! Amazing!
It would have been good to hear exactly what the scammer was saying before she responded.
My daughter will say Praise The Lord after everything the person on the other end says. They keep talking and she keeps saying Praise The Lord then when they ask for personal info she tells them if they don’t change their way of living they will go to hell and not heaven then they hang up!!
Great Job Captain
Duh what was your first clue captain?  Accent?
I love how she just looks so amused and pleased with herself and like she’s having so much fun. 😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂 that's great🤣 when asked for my social security number I would have given my badge number if I was her. 🤣
I just don’t answer calls If it doesn’t show a name
Sounds Indian accent 😅
Hahaha!!  This was good!
Always indians
When you block these scammers, does that really work?  I had been blocking up to ten scam calls a day, and it seems to be better.
Love this video!!!!  So cool!!!
I wanted to hear more of what the guy on the line was saying over the narrator.  🤷‍♀️
Not to hard to believe that a cop would be trafficking
My parents got scammed by someone using there banks phone number
I also had the same call and I also responded in the same way that the officer responded, it bothers me that people do those things, but no one, but no one has to call for your information, be careful... and about the police, I'm still waiting for them to arrive at my door lol it's already been 6 years of waiting.. lol lol
This is exactly how they do
Don’t answer the phone if you don’t know the number… if it’s important they will leave a meggage and you can call them back!
I do what the blues brothers did give them a shopping centre address it's so funny when the same thing is on my licence
I got a call like that. They said the police were coming to arrest me, if I didn't pay X-amount for a fine, and it was a warrant for my arrest? I said ok you know where I live, and I will be waiting for them to come get me!
Some police scam too, just saying.
First comment in 2 years
🎉🎉🎉
I had to happen to me for years ago that same skillman call me up and have me crying over the phone have me believing I was going to get West to be put in jail for didn't tell my information I was halfway asleep when I answer my phone and and I didn't know when I get my information and yeah I didn't know it was people just be careful scammers like that
Should trace the caller, catch the jerk!
Yes, they called my mom age 93 will she was dying
This should be on t.v. every day as a public service announcement.
I had  one of those calls. I work at a sheriff's  office.
They’ve tried doing this to me.  They did it to my ex & he got so scared, he hid between the bathtub & toilet in the bathroom & cried & yelled & screamed.  I knew it was fake.  😂😂😂
I wish she had told him she's a cop!!😅
Of course it’s a Indian guy
They did to me too They from India . They keep calling me  I told him to …….off
Those thieves call me all the time ...😒😏😏
Lol, don't hang up, get another divice to record and start a YouTube channel...
He sounds A nigerian
Can't they trace it he call.?
😅😅😅😅😅😅 priceless
Priceless, she is so cool.
Not giving out that information, IS A NO BRAINER
I also got one of these calls myself. He wanted my card number. I was laughing so hard. I told him to hold on. I heard the excitement in his voice. I grabbed my dog collar .my dog even looked at me strangely.  He was very happy.  Lol. He got my dog's rabies tag number. I told my dog that he should be getting his credit card soon.
And if that was true, why would the cops call her and tell her that she was going to be arrested, giving her an opportunity to run away or go into hiding 😭✋️
She's Gorgeous, and I don't even know what a cop is.
I love scam callers because their easy to recognize with their dumb reasons and I get to mess with them so much
You can tell by the accent he’s a scammer sitting in some call center in India or Pakistan
He picked the right one to try to scam. She should have gave the address to the headquarters. 😂😂😂😂
This would be a lot more educational for people if you actually let them hear the scammer instead of talking over it all.
Thank you capitan! 😊😊😊
Just to listen to his accent is a big good 👋 👋 👋 👋
5 minutes later the scammer called the next person. A police captain should have arrested him. Just give him a fake adress and wait with some officers for him.
😂😂😂😂😂
Lemme guess, it's in Indian accent
Another reason I NEVER answer numbers I don't recognize...
I get multiple calls like this a day. I had one from “Comcast” telling me I needed to pay $499 so they could update my TV receiver. I told them no thanks, I’d just have Xfinity send me a new one. He told me they couldn’t but their supervisor authorized a discount to $299. It was hard not to chuckle.  At one point he wanted me to give him my pin. I told him if I did that then he could get into my account as I suspected he was a scammer. So he told me he wasn’t as he had my pin and a scammer would ask me for my pin to get into my account. He realized what he said and then gave me an old pin which was gathered in a data breech.
I just do heavy breathing to numbers that I don't know or recognize and whoever it is just hangs up🤣😂! Thank you for sharing this 👍🏾
A police officer that has a Karen haircut 😂
I MISS THE OLD FASHIONED  CLICK OF THE PHONES ☎️
I've learned if it's an Indian accent hang up
Wow
I like to scammer the scammers.
LOVE IT !...😅...❤
Thats LITERALLY the exact karen look and shes not a karen
She should have been like "I'm going to be arrested by the sheriff's department? Well guess what? I'm the flipping police captain of the sheriff's dept sucker! Now what???"
I tell them I gave the information to their dad last night after he serviced me 😂
I like to have fun
I love how this police officer played this scamer like fiddle this video is awesome
Absolutely sounds like an indian person
Per an interview with Capt. Stephens, the original video has had more than 150 million views. She received emails from all over the world about it.
The caller has an Indian(India) accent.
Well come get me im at work
Love this!!!!!!!
I just don't believe anyone on the phone nowadays. I give everyone my 2 cents. If you're calling me, don't expect a pleasant conversation unless you're either already in my phone or caller ID told me who it is. Doesn't matter what company you say you work for, you're gonna hear some awful stuff and most likely some things that'll make you angry. (Let your imaginations fly)
What tables were turned?
DEI hire
Imagine scam calling a cop
lol. 😂😂😂😂😂 I remember this vividly. This happened here in NC in a town called “Apex”!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I hate to say this but 9/10 when you hear a certain "Voice"  that don't speak English.... It's a scam 🤔
I was scammed while at the lowest point in my life.  Stupid!  I know.  Does on ever recover from it?!!!
This probably won't happen to me since I instantly hang up every phone call that isn't familiar
O My God 😂😂😂😂😂
AMEN VERY SMART WOMAN SKILLFUL TOO.
Where in the video has she turned the tables on the scammer?
cant hear nothing but inside addition
😮😮😮😂😂😂 it’s funny but it’s something very educational 👍👍
I just don't answer calls in the first place 😂
So, when did she tell him she's a cop?
I love this😍
I watched the short 3x to see when she turned the tables on the scammer. It never happened
Bullhorn works well. I got really upset when they told me I was under arrest…. I told them I’d be dead before the police got here ..ended up the scammer was trying to calm me  down saying please don’t hurt yourself  it’s a scam. GOD bless all 🙏🏽♥️🙏🏿🕊️🫶🏽
I like to show intense concern over the status of my drugs cuz, you know, the weekends coming up..😂
These scammers need to be caught and put in prison for the rest of their lives!
I've wasted their time by telling them that I desperately need their help.  I'm hiding in my basement because someone has broken into my house and I hope they will call the cops for me and give them my location. Or, I have been put in the trunk of a vehicle and I don't know where I am so please call the police and give them my number. So funny how they always hang up on me 😂
Thing is, it's always some geezer that can hardly speak English, come on people, there seems to be a common thread here!
Decades ago i got a similar call, they threatened me with arrest unless I pay a bill I had, he wanted in full. He said he had me on camera getting a payday loan, I said I know that, that's when he got more intence with his language, and more verbal abuse.      He had me so scared (and I use to be a hardcore collections agent), i called my boss and told him they threatened to come to my job and I was going to be out for the day.  Next day, boss said no one came. I wish I knew who that was at the time, I would have done something to have them stopped.
The same thing happened in my town it maybe my town scammers I hate em
He sounds ftom india
"hello thanks for calling, your on a recorded line for quality assurance"
Ok…well, send em on!!😂🤣.
This is great. Have you seen the one where they try to con a security firm person who is an expert hacker? He played along giving false information until he could trace and hack them. That one was terrific!
Hilarious 😂
When Bob from tech support thinks his American voice is convincing
YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER SHOULD NEVER, EVER BE GIVEN OUT !!!!! EVEN TO THE DR. HOSPITAL, ETC.....  OUR OLD CARDS USED TO SAY THIS ON THE BACK OF OUR CARDS!!!!!  THIS IS FOR WORK PURPOSES ONLY!!!!!!
This happened here where I live in Apex NC. The news had many jokes about this. 😂
... And never install 'any desk', when a scammer tells you to (i fell for that one, because I did not know what 'any desk' was).
She should have set up a meeting with him and then made a call to bunko to set up an introduction.
They should try to trace the call
Her laughter is giving me life! 😅😂👏💞🙏
The scamer is "absolutely" an American... Not.
She didn't turn no damn tables dude
Class
Isn't it odd..hahaha that nearly ALL of these scammers have a foreign accent. I get 8-10+ calls on most days...
Did you tell him that you were going to arrest him for scamming LOL
🏗️🕌🕌🕌🕌🕌
Wish I would have knew this last month I got scammed and my bank account got shut down😢
She should have traced the caller and turned the table that would have been class scammer should have everything taken from them
I get calls like this all the time and do the same thing lol
I thought she was staying on the line in order for her team to track the call
She's awesome. True professional.
I've gotten a bunch of these calls I know they're scammers so I don't give them any information and I hang up on them and I do report them to the proper authorities
this captain is awesome also that captain rank is also a military rank as well
😂 Love this one
🤣🤣🤣🤣that’s weird!! Wish the police captain will find his location and arrest him immediately 💪
I love how she says “we kept him on the line to show people what they will do,” but the news station only plays about 5 seconds of what the scammer is actually saying.
. . . giving the precinct address would have been a laugh, along with false information . . . and tell the caller to hold until the arresting sheriff deputy arrives and they can properly confirm the arrest was made🛡️ . . .  😎
When she said they had to keep him on the line, I thought they had him! Why didn't they track the call?!! I would've been happier to hear that they got him!! I'm so sick of these scammers. Get a real job! Bums!!!
She got the job from being a professional catfisher with a Karen hairstyle like that
That accent sounds like that of a neighbor, who's from a giant and populous country here in west Africa.
Oh I'm  much nastier with scammers 😂😂😂😂
Karen captain looks like a full snack;)
I have fun with them and then I pretend to be an F.B.I. agent. Or I give them false information.
I got one of these scammers and I gave them the Tiffin police phone number. Then I called Tiffin police and let them know there’s gonna be a guy calling and they said he probably never call and he did so I got off the line and I have no idea what happened after that. He wanted my visa number so I said it wasn’t available at, where I was at that he’d have to call the other number and I gave him the number couldn’t believe he was Crazy enough to call it. He had a Mexican accent. And I knew it was the same guy because I was given the phone number to the different police and she repeated it back and said the guy was calling right now so you can have fun with them, but you give them no private information, except for maybe a local police number and see if they’re crazy enough to call it
I had one that freaked me out pretty good because it had a list of names of my family members, and even some addresses. I did get the cops involved, which may have been a mistake but yeah, that was really creepy
Acab😊
No,the best thing to do is lead them along as long as possible. If you could convince everyone to do that,eventually they would try their hand at honest work
kept him on long enough to trace call, likely in India or Pakistan.   could you imagine officer going there give warning if in US?  CLASSIC!!  Husband n I get these calls ALWAYS INDIAN OR PAKISTANI….. FACTS !!!!!
Friend of mine gets these about once a month about Sex trafficking
Thank you so much my beautiful sister 💕 💕 💕
After they say their name 😅keep asking him/her what their Grandmother calls them.  Sends them nuts..😅😅 THEN ask them if their Grandmother is happy with their choice of work  scamming people off their hard earned wages by lying.... 😟🤯 absolutely! 😊
Her features look like my French mother in law
How did she turn the tables exactly?
HaHa,good work Deputy
I wanted to hear the whole  conversation not the voice over
I want to meet the people that actually have bank accounts that fall for this.
i love her face of laughing
I just keep saying "I don't know" until they hang up.  If they don't, I say, thank you for keeping the call going long enough for us to pinpoint your location.  One of our agents will be with you shortly."
Shoes how pathetic our fbi really is ! They can investigate parents at a school board meeting but can't find these type of scammers ???
Crazy💀
Great job!
Why do you need my address when I'm right here in the police station
This is so good! Thank you Captain!
I love it 😆
😂
Let’s arrest scammers
I had one of these scammers call me. I was told that unless I comply my SSN would be cancelled. I said great! I won’t have to pay Taxes then!!!
Would’ve been great if you had traced the call and arrested that illegal immigrant that’s trying to steal from you and thousands others. Wish you could’ve done that and had that on video. Never gives anything important to someone you did not know on the other end of the phone. I hate scammers and lucky. I never got scammed so far..
I curse them out and talk condescending and rude to them. After all, they called to scam ME!
Don’t say “yes” or “no” they will steal that voice and put it on something that you didn’t say that for and make you spend money that you didn’t want to spend
She is a LEO. Shouldn’t she be trying to investigate this crime?
She is cute
I have a thing where I answer..."LAPD"... Usually works
...🤲🏾🙏🤲🏾✨✨✨😂...OH WOW...✨✨✨🤲🏾🙏🤲🏾...
I gave them a random SSN, the police address, a date of birth from 1925 and a fake account number. I waited for weeks for the cops to come arrest me. No one came and I never was called again.
When I get scam calls, I tell them the gospel & to turn to JESUS.
It’s usually a India accent
😂😂😂
In 2014 I received a call from “IRS” Agent Edwards saying that I owed them $10,000 and if I didn’t pay it with gifts within 24 hours law enforcement will issue a warrant for my arrest. Well it’s 2024 and I’m still waiting for them. 😂😂😂
she seems very sympathetic 😊😂
😂😂😂
Why didn't trace the line?
I had one call and act like the police. He said my bank account had been used for purchasing drugs and that I was going to be arrested. I went along with it and he ended up saying he had reasons to believe it wasn’t me that purchased the drugs and that I needed to go straight to my bank, withdraw all funds, go to Walgreens and get a prepaid Visa card, add all my money to it, give him the card info, and that one of his detectives would come to my house within 24 hours and give me a check for all the money they would be taking from the prepaid card. These scammers think they’re geniuses with their stupidity!
This is absolutely hilarious but also scary at the same time because of course they reached the captain but if they contacted someone who is older or has a mental condition they could possibly give in to the scammer
But what if it’s true and u we’re doing drug trafficking
Who answers strange calls anyhow? Oh, right. Old people who get scammed.
I been there more than once
And also...never say "yes" on the phone because they can use your yes to get your info electronically!
The caller sounds like one of Comrade Kamala's relatives.
She should’ve traded em😂
Love this video.  Excellent Captain ❤❤❤😂😂😂
If you get that kind of call, post the number on the internet. Trust me, they'll end up regretting they called soon enough.
Yeah good luck getting your older parent to understand this!!!
She should have traced the call.. he prob works  at  7-11
I love these calls bcuz I get to be racist when I talk back lol
She's so good 😂
My favorite address to give anyone ...  Where I live The street I live on City I live in 11111  (Said as written)  Or  1 Tomb Lane Tomb Land
Why is this news? It she arrested him, that would be turning the tables, not just wasting his time
“Abzulootly”
*casually gives him his social security number and home address*
Common sense stuff that brain cell usage would tell you not to give out
That scammer has been calling alot of people including someone i know!! What a hoax!!
That is correct but you find such urguaning
She was wonderful. But whoever did this video would have made it much more effective if we could ACTUALLY hear the kinds of things scammers will say. Instead, we twice hear him say "Absolutely". That's it! 😂 Funny, but not especially helpful!
I saw this video years ago when I was still in the service
I want to hear the end when she says she's with the police department and that she has made srrangements for HIM to be picked up at HIS place.
This is an old YouTube video, it came out several years ago. But it’s still hilarious.
The caller is Indian .. guy from North India .
Years ago, at a store, there was an older man in line ahead of me, pacing, sweating, with 4 $100 Amazon gift cards in his hands. I didn't know if he was having a medical emergency or what (I'm a nurse). I started making small talk with him. He got a scammer call exactly like this, and they demanded payment in Amazon cards. Luckily, the cashier heard some of our conversation and refused to sell the cards to this man (we live in a small town). This poor (literally), sweet, man barely had the gas money to drive to the store, let alone money to spend on these gift cards. He truly thought he was being arrested. We told him to go home and not answer his phone for a while.
You made my day 😅❤
Wonder How Much of The Actual 'Hell' Will Hold Those 'Scammers'!?
I sure wish the F.B.I. and whoever else would get together and find a way to stop these people.
This is old clip.
Man, you'd think that a police captain would know better than to traffic drugs...😂😂😂 FOH dude!
Love this captain
I'm over here like, my number is 911
I half expected the GTA SA:  You feeling me here? You about to wake up with your head 50 feet from your body son. Do as I say.
Did they even try to trace the call to anywhere like I know that scams aren't worth it but at least the department could do was trace the call to the center and shut it down like we fund the police enough to do investigations like this like did they further anything or just leave it at a prank call that should be mocked
That's why u keep the spam/unknown contacts blocker always on
Even more important, she could put bad cops to prison  Regards, Sonya Massey
They told me they were coming to arrest me. I told the guy, you've got my address, I'll be waiting with Henry Rifle.
One thing I do is answer the phone Hello? They start their speel. I then say thank you for calling I'm made up name. I'm answering the phone right now, What Agent do you need to speak with? I don't claim to be an agent nor that I actually work for them. If they think i do or am one that's on them. I was told that's perfectly legal to do. I no longer get those calls
Trace the call
Hilarious! BTW, also never say the word “Yes”, because they can doctor your call to make it sound like you’re agreeing to a purchase.
Just turn the tables and ask the scammer the scamming questions 😂
I proper wanted to hear his reaction when she told him that she was a police woman 😂😂😂
That's funny, but how come just about every scammer is from India 😂😂😂, should be a dead give away that you know immediately.
I've seen the full length video. I couldn't stop SMH and LOL. 😮😂
👀🤔💪🤘💯🇺🇲
I did give out info...all false info
😂
....they always have Indian accents....🤔
I had one about 3 years ago… I entertained him out of boredom for 40 minutes… at least that time wasted he couldn’t scam someone
I usually play with them and give them a load of false information, then, I tell them I will wait at home for the police to arrive and arrest me. It's a great sport! 😂😂😂
Also never say the words “yes” or “no” they’re prompts and once they have them recorded, game over
😂😂😂😂
I had that same scam call. My answer to him was if you got a warrant for my arrest then bring your punk ass down here and try to arrest me. 😂 Never heard a response back.
Ant you track him?
Well, then — what happened next?
Fabulous
She should’ve been like “oh my address is *cops station*
This why scamming is is so lucrative not even a police officer is interested in trying to abrehend or stop the scammer
That's fine. One called me trying to flirt and asked for the best number to reach me at. I gave him my "mama's number", which was really the number for the suicide prevention hotline, and then gave him the number to the rejection hotline. Kid you not, haven't gotten another spam call since! 😂😂😂
IM SORRY SOMETIMES, I CANT HELP MYSELF, IM WORST THAN THIS OFFICER!! GIVE OUT NO INFO..😂😂 THEY HANG UP ON ME!!🎉🎉😂😂😂
Were they not able to trace the call?
I'm gonna be charged with drug trafficking lmfao 🤣😆 bruh they don't even know she a cop lmfao that's why when people ask me for my address I tell they asses 1200 baker street downtown Houston that's Harris county jail lmfao 🤣😆
I'd love to see the look on his face when she slaps the cuffs on him. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Abslootly 😅
😮😮😮😮
Never give any information over the phone ever to anyone don't do it
😂
Heck yeah 😂😂😂 I hope they were able to catch the jerk on the other end!¡!¡! Ty sooo much for filling the people in on how NOT give out their income!¡!¡!
In the end did you tell him whobyou were?  It is fun to mess with them.
Captain fine🔥
I don't answer calls, texts or emails unless I know the person. I won't even open a text or email that looks suspicious. Sometimes all they need you to do is open the message. Sometimes you need to click a link. Regardless, I trust nobody.
It amazes me how many actually fall for these scams....my bro in law did bit the lady at Walmart started asking what he was buying for such large amounts he was putting on debit cards...another scam foiled!
She had time 😂
My son and his friends have a blast with scammers 😂. When he was 12 he got a call that his can warranty was going to expire Then I got on the phone and opened a can of whoop ass! I told the guy he was calling a 12 year olds phone. I then reported it.
I don't answer if you're not in my contact list! You can leave a message!
I have received a few calls like that. And I let them know I will report them to the police.😊
Usually the call center background noise is usually a dead giveaway 😂
Last time she spoke to me on the phone I asked for her SSN very nicely and she just gave it to me. Didn't have to threaten or lie, just asked nicely.
💙💙💙💙💙
I hate them kind of people 😒
She did nothing to prevent this nonsense she chuckled like it was a joke. Track phone numbers find these crooks lock ‘em up so they stop calling us civilians
She looks like someone who would yell “run away fruit” when someone drops something at the grocery store
ty, sheriff
I have had calls just like this. 😂 So obviously a scammer.
I hate scammers i will shut them down
Did you trace the call?
God sees all get ready for the fall
Great job. Lol
Should have showed up at his house and arrested him!!!!!!
Give them junior samples from hee haa and tell them your phone number is br549 lol
Thank you for the "tutorial,"  Captain.   The fake IRS kept calling me.  I got info from THEM & reported it to the Treasury Dept. & some other federal group.  A few weeks later, the Feds shut that group down.  New groups pop.up all the time.  Hang up!
Unreal!! Sounds like the dude has a Spanish accent!!
😂😂😂😂
I've been on the other end  with scammer and this is Exactly they're tactics
I talk to them like I've been expecting their phone call a week prior. I start off upset that it took them too long to talk to me. They hang up and don't call back.
We're going to send you to arrest you.
With an Indian accent I just hang up
I tell them ohhh goooodeee I love men in uniform will they do me?
No charge, glad you made detective let alone captain
She's so amused a scambag is tryna scam a police captain.
Proverbs 3:5-6
Why didn't they trace the call and arrest him??
Captain Anne Stevens You're A Real HERO For Documenting All Of These Scammers! Blessings On You Captain In Yeshua Jesus Christ's Precious Saviour's Name Shalom And Amen!✝️✝️🛐🛐😇🌟🤗🙏🙏🙏🇨🇦🇮🇱♾️🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🗽🦅❤❤❤‼️
Maybe I've watched too much television, but...trace the call? Is that possible?
Thank you for sharing this.
But yet we send a bunch of money to all these people And other countries  trying to scam as Americans that they hate makes no sense do better America make this stop why is this our responsibility😢
Good Job Captain,  👏I surely wish there was a way to permanently end scams forever more, it is getting way out of control.  I personally am warned daily on the internet to watch out on my apps. Blessings to you-🧡🌻🧡
Rather than try to catch the scammer she couldn’t help but tell the scammer that she’s actually an officer.
John Smith has a very India🇮🇳 accent 😅
The only thing you need to know: they don’t call to tell you that they’re coming. Nuff said.
She has that Karen haircut.😂
give a random string of numbers on each calls.
Way to go Ma'am.  Too bad you can't arrest them.
Good job 😢😢😢😢😢
I think that ship is sold because every worker of every company just by having a good memory they got your records also a.i storage in Italy, Brazil. Texas have records of everyone of us….. so it doesn’t matter
Such fun!
I would be like how about I come there to arrest you because I’m a police chief /captain!
Just tell Abu to get a real job😂
She should have traced to call and arrested him
If a name don't pop up I'm not answering. If it's important, they'll leave a message.
I would love to hear her tell him that she's a real police officer!!
One of those scammers called me and wasting 30 minutes of his time was the most entertaining thing of my life especially near the end of the call when I started to act all entitled demanding to speak to his manager.
I hope that one day these people will be dealt with.
Always Indian 😂
ofc hes indian 😂
You did a wonderful job and you just helped me and others as well.  My hat is off to you and I hope that you have a long career in law enforcement. I am a former police officer. Captain this is very good information. Thank you for sharing your video!!!!
What she should’ve said was I’m a cop to I’m going to arrest you
This video never gets old 😂😂😂
❤❤❤
And never, never ever, never… go buy gift cards to pay your “fines” lol
Tip number one they’re Indian
If I don't  recognize the number, I always use a  local sheriff's office.  I always say." Chatooga county sheriff's office,  fraud devision,  this Lynn how may I help you " after that there's usually a hangup 😂
they also hate being called pajeet or banchode
No wonder these scammers get away with this, the cops think it’s funny and cute. A friend got scammed of all her money last December and spent Christmas asking for donations for her family because it took the bank 90 days to get some of the money back.
I had a call like this. I said come on over. You can meet my friends Mr Smith & Mr Wesson.
DEI capt
I usually adopt whatever kind of accent they have and start talking to them. They don't like it. It really cuts down on the number of scammers that call.
She probably wanted to speak with his manager
Way to go. Wow, drug trafficking. Right. This is priceless.
These days, they will send you a text claiming that you have a package with USPS, but the address was wrong and needed to be corrected. When you get these texts, delete them, USPS will not text you requesting your address.
Track them down and introduce them to Miranda rights!
I had one, i would not let them get past the intro.  I kept questing their location and their business.
0:53 Who’s there?
Couldn't trace him
Scammer picked the wrong fool
"We do not know where you live but if you do not give us money we will send a deputy to arrest you!" :-D
I've had one of these unfortunately but it amazes me how much info they keep asking for (and the lengths they go to to try and get it) even though the caller supposedly has your file. 🙄
I had a call like that before. I him better bring body bags. Because the number they was using was my own number
Thank you Capt.
She looks like a Karen, but isnt. There's hope for that hair style then.
Wdym hangup just don't answer or decline
Trace the call
Whenever I get scam phone calls, I can tell if it’s a scam so I just don’t answer the call to act like I’m not at my home or I’m not with my phone/IPad
Captain You where absolutely fabulous  Thank you for your services
Perfect loop
I love to mess with them, it’s always hilarious
You guys should work with the big scambaiters like Kitboga, Pierogi, Syskey and Jim Browning!
I hope they kept him on the line long enough to find out where he is and go and arrest him
You're a heroine ❤
I mess qith them all the time
My elderly mother loves to mess with phone scammers. It's fun for her and often hilarious to listen in on! She had one going in the car one day and got to the point that my best friend and I were both about to wet ourselves trying to hold our laughter in. 😂
My grandma's cousin is in the FBI. So she'll talk to them as long as she can, getting as much information as she can, then tells them "now, I'm going to have to talk to my son in the FBI about this" and that's usually when she hears the click as they hang up lol
So what happened?  Did she follow through with turning this over to the FBI to track them?  Just goes to show that not even true law enforcement aren’t immune to scammers!!!😂😂😂😂
Never ever trust a scammer.
Not surprised it was an Indian 😂. And that’s coming from a fellow Indian, yours truly.
I vividly recall this video! And in the end she said have a little fun with them (the scammers). Besides it frustrates them.
Tell him you'll guve him what he wamts if he gives out his personal information first.  Say you want to pay him off secretly to keep him from doing this and see what happens.  Apoeal to their greed and see what happens
This needs to be put on TV!
I have a policy that if I don't recognize the number, I'm not answering the call.
This was a classic video. Seen this one a couple of years ago
If only they could be pulled through the phone.
😮😮😮😮😮😮 from Malaysia 🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾
Great job, Captain!! Thanks for sharing!!!
I wonder how long she kept him on the hook before she told him she was a police officer.
the police should track that person who tried to scams this police officer that way they can be put in jail for the rest of their lives
A police captain refuses to give out her personal information to a scammer would be a more accurate title! 😮‍💨
I got a call from border control saying I am going to be arrested  because they found a package  that contained  drugs in it with my name
Just listen to the voice! You know he's a fake
Ha ha ha, love it 😂
LOL
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I had this call, about the same year, 2019! I cussed him the smooth out! 🤬🤬🤬
This is what happened to my mom but she actually fell for it because the scammer gave a real police name and told her she missed jury duty and gave her an address that we used to live at so she thought maybe it got sent to the wrong address and then she paid him a “fine” of like $1000…. But it was fake so she got scammed
Something similar happened to our County Sheriff. The actual Sheriff. The caller told him that the Sheriff would be there shortly to arrest him, and he replied "I'm going to arrest myself?" And before he realized what was said, he replied "Yes, he will.  Wait, what?"
Karen haircut Hall of Fame? Jesus! That’s the white women equivalent to a mean fade and nice edge up.
Air horn...
She should of told him hey facetime me and il give you my info and let him see her in  uniform that would be hilarious watch him 💩 himself and instantly regret his life decisions
Why didn't she use the time to have the call traced?
Lol😂😂😂😂😂 so good!!!
I've had this scam happen to me the guy was sooooo mean
U get him young lady
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤o wow hell yeah
Yes offering to drive them to the bank. Tax office would never call you regarding money. Scammers from overseas.
with that accent ?😂😂😂😂😂😂
Don't answer for unknown numbers. I quit answering for unknown numbers years ago.
I seen this whole video a while back. It was kinda funny. If only the scammer knew who he was talking to. Lol
Whenever I get these types of calls I put my phone in a pot cover it then smash the pot multiple times. 😂
Karen haircut is strong
karen hair lol
Ahhhhhh classic  BY ANY CHANCE CAN YOU WORK HERE IN DUBLIN TONS OF SCAMMERS Omg GO Girl 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
THE BEE KEEPER is a satisfying movie about what to do to scammers......
I switched my phone number, and the person before me has massive credit collections. They call nearly every day. I know it’s not the same thing, but sometimes I feel like I’m trying to make someone believe that I’m not an Indian man with $46,000 debt. I don’t know, this conversation between them reminded me of how I have this default voice like I’m the criminal.
Kool lady❤
Too funny 🤣🤣🤣
Why don't you go further and find out the number and get him arrested????
Why? Couldn't they trace the call?That's kind of weird
Best ever
I hope they tracked him down and arrested him for impersonation a police officer, ect…
SO interesting that a scammer finally called a person of power. Great advice.
She didn’t turn any tables on the scammer. Just didn’t cooperated or give out important information.
India call center?..yeah not gonna have anything to do with that
The same tricks the police use by the sounds of it
I don't trust anyone with an Indian accent
BLOCK & DELETE!!
She has my last name 😱
The minute I hear someone say this is so and so "kwalling" I hang up.
lol I had one but I did not answer that called me this 12 times
Yeah my ex started the whole calling them back and harassing them. Before everyone started doing it, he found every number listed on the internet, and then preceded to call every single one bc they’d hang up on him and block his number lol. I swear I’m not lying. To this DAY they don’t call his phone lmao!  This was YEARS ago.  Theyre so lazy they can’t get an honorable job and earn their money.
This happened to me  and i got so scared  i gave my info 😢😢
Who cares
I only wished they could have trased the call. Probably an overseas
Thank you officer I really appreciate that it's good to hear I've been getting some scammers calls 😇💝🤗🙋🏽🤗🙋💯🐞
Couldn't You track the phone call or not?  Give it to the gov dept that takes care of this? LM
They tried the same scam with taxes, and diabetic supplies. They ask for your social security number or to get a prepaid card.
This is one smart female police captain cause she knows how to handle this scammer good job dudette
Them damn scammers they're getting better. I had a phone call sound like it was coming from the social security department😅.. boy was I scared call. Until  I called the real social security department.
My mom did
I ordered an aquarium background that was coming from China off amazon and some scammer called and said they confiscated it because there was 10 pounds of heroin and 100k in cash in the package and said i was going to be atrested. He wanted me to text him a picture of my drivers license while i was on the line. I texted him a picture of my aquarium showing the background and said thanks for the cash and drugs as well. I wasn't expecting a free gift
Good one. 😂
Hilarious
Pathetic.  Good job. Probably a hacker.
I’m so glad the captain handled the situation the way she did, but my problem is how many senior citizens, including my dad have gotten these kind of calls. Where they say someone has been arrested and you need to give me money right now. Luckily, when my dad went to his local bank branch, the teller saw that he was in distress and called the police and refused to let my dad withdraw any money! Thank God!
I do this for fun sometimes.   I never give any personal info, but have fun with it.
I like when they call me about car insurance. I like when they call me me about animals. I just love they call me it's so much fun.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I think it's in my phone
That's what feels like happened to me
hmmm Police Captain? Sounds like a pretty solid alibi for your drug trafficking side gig
IRS r my favorite calling me is just like calling her..jus sayin I've worked for at one time soooooo I knows ..😮
You really shouldn't hang up because all you're doing is passing it on to somebody who is probably more vulnerable. I keep them on the line for as long as I can and give them as much bogus information as I can. That way to waste some time trying to figure out what's real and what's not real only to discover none of it's real.😂😂
Modern day prank calls lmao
Now every number they call from is disconnected. All spoofed caller ID. They call me 25 times a day no joke. I started answering the phone like I was from a government agency and the calls have started to subside
Great job officer
I get at least five of these calls a day it's because I was trying to find a job and I was using an app off YouTube and it asks you for basic information like your phone number that's how they get your phone number
I get them to hang up on me by asking them what my name is
She should track the call...
This was hilarious, she clearly enjoyed this. However a warning to anyone wanting to do this these days, you don't want to engage at all. As soon as you realise it's a scam just hang up. Say as little as possible. As funny as it is to waste their time and play with them times have changed. With AI tech now they're likely taking samples of your voice. Those samples could be used to recreate your voice and scam family/friends. This is already happening, they'll record something like "please help, I'm stuck in (a random place) and can't afford to get home, can you send me some money so i can get a train/uber/taxi?" etc. How many people second guess someone who sounds just like their son, daughter, friend, whatever, begging them for help in a crisis? Don't give them the sample to work with. Seriously. This stuff is real now and it's already scamming people.
Good advice. But difficult to trust the police... This seems like it is all an act. Sorry  ..
Captain is hott❤
I hope you got him arrested.
But - if you’ve just been through a bad divorce or break up - feel free to provide them with your ex’s (or someone else’s information.
why didnt they trace the call
I hope they traced the call of that S.O.B.  they need to arrest him with a real Police officer 😂
Why didnt they trace his number then tell him his address 😂
Always give out your ex’s SSI instead
That foreigner accent is your first clue 😂
Never, ever give out personal information to anyone unless you know whoever it is personally.  Check out any claims they make with the police.
If people have not learnt this stuff by now then they should seriously NOT be using any form of technology & most definitely should be fully supervised 24/7!!!!!
I always ask them to hold on minute while his mom and sister finish me. They usually start swearing at me at that point🤣
Use old fashioned answer machine for your home phone,
My dad use them to learn English not giving any personal information 😂
It never ceases to amaze me just how naive AND stupid any reasonably “grown/adult” can be to even “give out their personal info over the phone to complete strangers” let alone ANYONE!!...as I always heard  as a child, “common sense AIN’T common”.😩
Let me guess, she rented a vehicle in Texas and used it in a robbery😂😂
I can't find anything funny here.
I am glad that you guys know now what we all go's throw on the phone. Or do what I do just hang up.
So many of them have Indian accents too.
Oh and when they will be here to arrest me in 10 minutes I tell them to make it 15 and I'll call Dominos and what do they want on their pizza?
What did he dial 911? 😜
Lol lol
When I get phone scammers that call me I pick up the phone and I start asking them inappropriate questions
**** it let’s all ditch our current phones and get the cricket. 4 numbers max, no one else is allowed to call. lol problem solved. But you also can only call those 4 only too
It happened to me every day at least once a day  so annoying
She's not a cop.. jeezzz
Testing one two one two😮
I go along with the crooks and give them a lot of WRONG NUMBERS and NAMES...ALL THE TIME😂😂😂😂😂
How about tracking the number and arresting them
where is that demon live?
HAHAHA  🎉
If this scammer called me and it got to the point that say I  going to be arrested for drug trafficking I'd just " Too late I've been to trial for drugg trafficking and found guilty  but the sentence was suspended and I can't  be tried again for the same offense so sorry bye bye"
My name?  Absolutely  My address? Absolutely  My Social Security number? Absolutely Had drug trafficking? Absolutely When was that? Absolutely
Goes to show it can happen to anyone.
Does anyone remember a movie called "Up in Smoke" from Cheech & Chong? Call the scammer a lard ass, laugh and drag them down the road for your own amusement say & do things to P155 them off but don't hang up, if you do, they don't have to pay for the long distance call, if they hang up they do have to pay for the call.
Awesome
Should have given him the address to the station absolutely 😂😂 okkkky.😅
That's those Indians from India I can tell by their accent!!!!
Good job office.
He's not from this country. He's got some kind of  acsence
Not a very good police captain ! Shes kept him on the line for so long but couldnt trace the call ? Its 2024 we can find your mobile / device but cannot trace calls ? 😂😂😂😂😂
Some questions should have given you a clue. Police don’t call you on the phone to arrest you. He was trying to blackmail you
These calls happens a lot of times .
Had this happen with some scammer claiming to be from Publishers Clearing House.  Kept it up until I got bored.  Must admit it they stuck with with even when I read to them from their own website, saying that Publishers Clearing House will NEVER call you.  The dude never broke character.
And why isnt he being traced and arrested duh .
I've had scammers call usually about medicare benefits. I voice record them, capture their phone number, and look the number up on my second phone [which gives their other numbers too]. They don't like it when I call them by name, ask how the weather is at their location, and say their phone number. Then I block all their numbers.
If someone with an Indian accent calls you assume it’s a scam
Great job...😊
👍👍👏👏
I did that once, thought the sherif was a scammer and now I’m in jail watching YT shorts 💀
Give scsnner his / her work [gaol] address, and awaits his arrival.
Man i need to memorize the address of a foreign call center.
I like messing with them and it can get really funny if you do it right 😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂
I will make them crazy that they never call me again. I laugh and cursed them in different language. 😂
I would act like a baron talk how i got bunch of people's heads on my wall for trying to get to my amazing wealth.
“Sir, I AM THE DEPUTY!”
Hilarious
My sister cussed a scammer out one time. It was hilarious
Got a text message from a scammer once. I had to pay €5000 in back payments on my motor vehicle tax or they would tow my car. Kept them talking for half an hour, sounding all upset and coöperating, bgging them for some lenience. I was so remorseful.  Also, I don't own a car.
Dude I used to work with would keep scammers on the phone for hours so they wouldn't scam other people 😂
I've done that before It sounds like the same guy OMG 😮
I used to get thesr kind of calls a couple times a week. It got to the point I looked forward to them. I had such fun keeping them on the line, asking stupid questions,  just being an all around pain in the ass. When it comes down to it, as long as you don't give them any real information you can have a lot of fun with them.
Ha, ha, love it! Just too bad they can’t catch this scammer and arrest him!
"What the insurance on your car, sir?" - scammer "Yea, it's" *hangs up phone* - me
I need to be told over the phone that I am being arrested? I thought they would just bust down the door.
When being arrested for drugs I need to be told over the phone? I thought they would just bust down the door
I let them know they're busted! I actually report them to the FTC and phone companies as well as block them immediately and report them
I've had so many scam calls requesting to confirm my information.  I tell them you should have my file in front of you. Ivan blocked their number and hang up.
I love it! Bwhahahaha whoopie! HILARIOUS
I've had several. Usually, it's,  " you've won something, need my info. I lead the on for as long as I can, so they use up their minutes on their throw-away phone.
She did nothing to “turn the tables”!!!!!!! What the heck???!!!!!
Ask them to hold on and then act like they’ve been transferred to FBI SCAM division! 😂
😂 Should Have Said: "867 5 3 O 9....!"😅
Is it just me, or the scammer has an Indian accent?
Pity she couldn't track him and give him a visit!  But where did she do him in? She just blocked him. No turing the "tables" as suggested.
The captain should be arrested him
And she's dealt with scammers a lot o have seen vids about her on other scams
Youthpasterryan be like don't give them your info give them their info
I never answered any unknown calls and as months pass by, I barely receive like 1 or 2 calls every few months or so
🤣🤣🤣 this is good because it’s not just me getting the scam calls. now the police officers know what we go through. They should trace the call and have him arrested in which country he’s from.
Tell them to get a real job instead of scamming people
I always use whatever accent they have back at them - (with my questionable skills!) and they quickly get confused and hang up.    "Did I just call my brother?"
Buy an air horn.  I won't tell you how to use it.
well a FEMALE police  captain
I never answer my phone if I don't recognize the number. If the call is important the caller will leave a voicemail.  Done!
😂😂😂😂😂😂
She should have told him is talking to the police abd will be sending out an officer. Click!😂
Thank you!
What table was turned
you go ma'am
I have a very lonely job so I enjoy seeing how long I can keep them  on the phone I've even had them call me back to use nasty words I just laugh.
If shes smart, trace the caller's  location.
Modi create lost of criminal even USA companies fault who gives business to these countries where employees leaked your information and no one accountable for this kind of crime
Should have  reported to FBI. Oh wait, too busy investigating concerned parents about corrupt school boards. And raids on laptops and diaries they said didn't exist but already had in law enforcement custody.😢😮.
Smart captain.  The scammer had a Republican accent.
Part 2
LOVE HER!
Love it
I get these all the time. They get so frustrated at me. I take them beyond what they’re not prepared for. They hang up on me. 😂😂😂😂
This isn't a joke i was scammed like this and now im homeless and living in my car idk what to do
That is rich!
Tell Ali Baba you're going to his office full of scammers in India to arrest him! 😅😂
I was informed arrest was imminent unless I remitted money immediately to an   e-address for late tax🎉
Love it. Great job Captain.
Bro I just got that call like 2 days ago 😆 except they told me I had a package that arrived at UPS from China they were calling from Texas. Dumb mistake 😅
I'm glad you didn't go for that scam
Good for you
She should’ve tracked the call
I'm glad she said date of birth. They don't always include it with the other personal information.
I have a police whistle hanging right by my door for scam calls. Unfortunately, I've only had the pleasure of using it once on a caller. 😂
Lol!
That's funny 😂 my daughter fell for something like this she gave her bank's pin now she has to wait six months she just giggled
Blue line gang at its best
Hilarious watching the Captain; she had fun with this scammer!
Always make up numbers and dates, just play their games and have some fun.
Great job captain👏🤗❤️. It's a pity you couldn't track him, and have him arrested. Old scammer!!!☹️😡
Well it’s so convenient she can just go next door and ask one of her officers to arrest her put her in a cell and you can rest for a few hours.  Sounds like a plan to me
I never answer a number I don't recognize. if it's important they will leave a message.
It is so scary to think they could easily get someone to believe them and get all their money from their bank account 😢
I tell scammers my (fake) name is Bena P. Ussy.
I thought she was gonna say she was keeping him on the line so they could find out where he's calling from and arrest him 😂  I wish she had revealed she was an officer at the end of the call. I would've loved to hear his reaction to that! 😂😂
Amen 😊😊😊❤❤❤
Am I racist or every scamster that people talk to on videos has the same voice? I'm Indian btw.
THIS HAPPENS ALOT.
Got that threat myself. Lol
BEEN THERE !  DONE THAT!
if the caller isn't on my contacts list, I don't respond to them.  If it's legit, they will leave a message and I can call them back.
They tried that with me so many times it's unbelievable even when I was working on a copier in the home office and they says they was calling from there trust the whole office was in esterics
Why would you not trace the call????  This guy probably scammed 1000's of people!! How about you do something about it and not just laughing about it!! I guess, honest, hard-working people losing more money that they don't have just isn't important enough to the police to actually do something about it!! Don't tell me that this video is what you're doing because if that's all that the police can do, that is absolutely horrible, and you should definitely check your priorities!! This is a massive, massive problem in America!! People have lost everything because of scammers like this, and all the police can do is laugh and make a video about it!!😡🤬😡🤬
The sad thing is the elderly people give their information and they get scammed.  Good she is a 👮‍♀️ that time.
1,250th
I feel bad for anyone who actually works these jobs with an Indian accent. It’s terrible, but I’ve gotten to the point where if I hear the accent I hang up. Although if there’s anything important the government needs to contact me for they’ll either send a letter in the mail or show up at my door, so I really don’t feel that bad
As soon as I hear "that" accent...click!
With that accent I would have straight up replied with “I didn’t know they have sheriffs in India”
She should ask him where he would be sending the sheriff deputy to 😅
I'll never hang up on a good laugh 😅😅
I like having a nice chat with them. Keep them on the line as long as possible knowing full well I'm never gonna give them any information.  Let them enjoy the phone bills, I'm sure their bosses will love seeing no results for an hour's work, all while I was doing laundry and cleaning up. Managed to mow my whole lawn once and kept shouting over it saying it was my neighbour, scammer got sooo mad i couldn't help but laugh.  It's so much more rewarding when THEY hang up on YOU out of anger or frustration 😂
Police don't call you. Real simple. The IRS knows everything about you, they never need info. Real simple. If you fall for stupid tricks you're the idiot
Scammer sounds Indian??
An older friend fell for a scam and went to Target to purchase gift cards to "pay off the bill". Fortunately, when the staff asked him why he needed gift cards for $1000, they informed him he was scammed.
Lol she's adorable. Her little chuckles in her uniform 😂😂😂
Last time someone tried I called him by his real name. He never called back afterwards lol
So nice of the police to call her and inform her they were on their way to arrest her. I hate it when they show up unannounced, how am I supposed to have snacks set out? Sure I may be a drug trafficer, but I'm not a bad host.
I wonder if she could have commandeered unused police bandwidth to trace the call and dox the scammer
I give the scammer my exs social 😂😂😂
AWESOME, GOOD JOB CAPTAIN, THANK YOU FOR RECORDING THAT & SHARING IT WITH US !!!
I think I talked to this guy, he didn't quit
Awesome job. Great info too. Thank you. God Bless you for protecting us.
Why not trace the call & arrest him?
She was arrested by the county deputies shortly after she filmed this..
She should have said , I can give my badge and police district where I am at not . I'm a police officer! 😂🤣
This was done to my husband and he believed them. I was like... no phone for you 😂😂😂
I got one and told him to see me in court
The police captain is the daughter of a friend! Smart lady!
its fun to waste their time( shrug ) you may save a person from being scammed. not by this one, .. this is very unconvincing as story. the scammers story. i meant.
" Ohh.. how embarrassing for you. ".. This guy is in India, surely, where they despise this kind of dishonesty, the public in India has no pity or respect for these people who scam there.
Cops getting good laugh out of this she should a total scammer I hope you got arrested
I always like to let them talk to my friend name dial tone
wrong person to scam😂🤣better luck next time scammers🤬
Nothing surprises me at what they will do to steal whatever they can.
I always ask them extremely perverted questions and then laugh when they get mad. For some reason they don't call back. 😂
I held one on the line for 2 hrs, telling him I was waiting for the police to come, I was sitting outside with a Bright color shirt
So what happened to the scammer??? Finish the story!!! 😤😤😤😤
If I have time to talk to them, I'll always have fun. 😊
We all knew he was gonna be indian
Just give false information
If I don't know who's calling me I don't even answer my phone.  And all my phones have ringtones attached to them so I know who it is.
Criminal on phone.... HEAVY ACCENT  "absolutely"
He was the stupid one.
I say this is Wong Chinese how may I help you
This scammer knows one word absolutely😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
That's too funny, good job officer 👍☮️ out
Ive had one of those calls. Then, i called the sheriff/marshals office
Always the people from BombBay making these calls
I had this same phone call happen to me in 2006, the scammer told me I was going to jail and the police where on there way.  The dump thing was the stupid person actually called me from an aerospace in Los Angeles.  People please be careful and don’t give out your information.  Scammers call you by using other people’s phone number, even corporate phone number. I’ve also had so one call me from the actual company number, but it wasn’t from the company..
If I don't regognize the number  I don't even answer the phone
So! they're gonna come all the way from India to arrest me?
I would love to see the look on his face
I did tell this one scammer please send the cops and make sure they bring the handcuffs. I told him I love those handcuffs. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This happened to me in a different way.
😂
I just ask them over and over again who they're calling for. If they can't give me a name or try to redirect I just tell them I can't help them unless they give me the name of someone in my household. Sometimes they get so angry they start screaming and i say in the calmest most saccharine southern voice possible "well hun i caint help ya if ya keep screamin like that. Let's calm down and take it from the top okay?"  If they do know the name of someone in my household I badger them about other things like our address or what state we live in. And take it around and around in circles of questions anger and breathing techniques. In my opinion the longer i keep them on the phone with me the less likely some elderly person gets scammed
I use to get those.  I told them where can I pick my drugs up at 😅😅😅😅
Nah what i do is get a big ol pan and put it over my phone then get i get the biggest spoon i can find and then start smacking the pan
Why wasn't the  call traced ,??
Unlucky scammer at that day.😂😂😂
I’m a tech dude, don’t answer the phone at all when receiving an unknown number because one: they’ll see that it’s an operable device and they sell your phone number to hundreds of scam call buildings and then you’ll get spam calls like crazy. DONT PICK UP ON RANDOM CALLS. They literally make money off you picking up the phone
For sure +92 😂😂😂
Indian accent.. from asia
😂😂😂👍👍👍
I ask them how do they know. Then I say I have a kilo deal for only $200. They usually hang up.
Wish she gave out the precinct address so he panics afterwards
Awesome last night same as mine !
Good lesson for all of us
Thank God for the officer
Thank you very much , for telling us how to be aware of this rats. called “scammers “
I scam scammers
That’s those Arabs with those scamming calls and yes I said it
Tell them they need to come early because you're getting evicted today and would like to get into the jail so that you can have a place to sleep tonight.
I was told a police car would pick me up and I’d be arrested if I didn’t go to the bank and pay residual income tax to where and how I was told to pay. I asked when the car would pick me up because my car was in the shop so they could drive me. The guy got very angry with me.
I would have loved to here her do the "Oh No what ever shall i do"
😂 got one of these before. I laughted so hard. I said "really, your accent sounds like that I know the scam just from your sound. Hell send who ever you want. I be more than happy if it was you. You seem to think I'm a fool.  I wait for the day a scammer comes to my house."
Shes beautiful lol
Why police didn’t try to track the location of this scammer then put them to jail so they cannot scam other people
Ofc there Indian
😳😜😂🤪👍🏽
I LOVE my caller ID. ❤
I return them with a very funny payback.  Letting me think they have reached a business.
The Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) hosted a hearing on March 20, 2024: “Stopping the Crime of Organ Harvesting—What More Must Be Done?” Four witnesses testified during the hearing and provided detailed action that can be taken to end forced organ harvesting by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).   The Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) held a hearing on March 20, 2024 to stop forced organ harvesting in China.  CECC Chair: “An Atrocity Unmatched in Its Wickedness”
Y’all need to see the ending lol. It’s hilarious when she says oh by the way I’m an officer.
I F*** w/SPAM CALLERS LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME! (they eventually get tired of ME & hang up…😂)
Missed the best part!! She says "You realize you've called the police department right?" and he hangs up.
lol 😂😂😂
Don't give them access to your phone either.
Mine sounded so much more real. No accent even.😳
Sheriff deputies coming from India
I got multiple of these during COVID I just told them to pull up💁🏿
I got scammed this way about six or seven years ago
Indians 😂
I had this very same thing happened to me. About 2 years ago, they threatened me. Told me they were going to put me under investigation and I could be charged with conspiracy to commit a crime.
Can't she get the callers number and track him down? Just thought it was funny!
That's what happens when you randomly dial!!  😱😱😱🥴🤭😏🤔😁
Can you trace this call and could catch this Indian scammer?
What's the difference when a "cop" does it?
Amen, he is   out of his mind , Jesus Christ 😂🎉😢😢😅😅😊😊😊 ❤❤
She’s laughing because she knows no cop could ever be arrested and charged for drug trafficking. She’s the captain and the Union has her back
When I am angry, I have said, “This conversation is being recorded for a scam alert!” They hang up fast! Then so do I.
With banks government and whoever it’s out there all the time warning people be careful but as the same goes there one barn every minute
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
If I don't know what phone number I would not even answer it because I will know it's a scammer if someone wants to call my phone they will find out what I said by leaving a message if you're a scammer I don't want to hear from you
I would like to know why the police asked people for their Social Security number
Great public service announcement!! here’s the issue. If you work in corporate America, you probably receive training on how not to get phished or giveaway your companies, secrets, etc. but if you’re retired, you’re not getting that type of training. You know, and if they don’t watch the news, they might not be aware of these kinds of scammers.
This video can serve to help the helpless. But do the helplessness view YouTube videos?
Omg my mom almost paid 1000 dollars to one of these idiots. Thank God I was with her when she got the scam call.
So did the captain follow up with an investigation and catch these crooks?
I heard President Trump got one of these calls: it wasn't a scam though
I love hearing these calls.
Should have given him the police address
BE CAREFUL WITH INDIAN ACCENT
AND THE SCAMMERS IS INDIAN OF COURSE
I love it more when the scammers call hackers, and the hackers proceed to give the scammer their own information. Even a live feed of their webcam.
BLOODY BLOODY
Thank You So Much My Queen 👸🏻
Why they always Indian 😂
I got one of these calls. Claimed i was going to be put under the rest.
They have an India accent so that a dead give away
Well Done officer 👏
Plot twist: After filming a sherrif's deputy with a heavy middle eastern accent shows up and arrests her, the biggest drug kingpin on the east coast.  Deputy: Ve just Vanted a payoff. Ve varned you!
The scammer is indian for sure. Most scammers live in india.
I often say ... just a second ... then Yes officer .  . That is the location.
Never say "yes" they record yes, and can scam you as well.
😆
Ain’t no way this is real, talk about karma😅
And what exactly has to the person making the call???? Nothing???
I wish it showed when she told the scumbag she was a police captain!! 😮
How about trace the call and go and arrest them?
The ones bothering me have come from Jamaica. Crazy as a loon.
Don't say yes
I love this,I kept one of these scammers on the line for over 5 minutes just for my entertainment and then reported them to our local police department.The scammer was in Africa.😂😂😂
As a cop it’s funny. As a regular person you low key thinking about getting killed in a no-knock raid being done on the wrong house….
Man, I so wanted to see the scammers reaction when she told him she was actually a capt lol
Actually, what works for me is to tape record the conversation if you live in a one party, tape-recording, State, and then tell him at the end of the call that he’s live on YouTube and it will scare him heck outta them. Then post the video to educate other people.
How can you arrest me if😅you don't know my address😅😅😅
😂😂😂😂 I got one of those calls too!
I always say I’m gonna give you to my mom.  Then answer FBI how may I assist you
Beware ucredit people some try to sham you  on the computer by getting you to give out private information dont
Last time I got a call like this I put the phone under a steel bowl and just whaled on it with a spoon. They didn't call back after.
This could easily be stopped.  Why isn't it stopped?
Pull an uno reverse and give out all of THEIR information instead. Good way to get blacklisted from scam calls
This lady is a national's treasure.
I had something similar happen to me some years ago.  Dude threatened me & I argued back with him.  I knew he was in a foreign country & was just watching Goggle Maps. I really talked junk to him. He threatened to come to my house & get the money & he described the color of my door. I replied “C’mon over…you can meet the Sheriff that I just alerted!  Then all I heard was the dial tone🤣😂
I've had that happen to me before. Thank goodness I knew it was a scam. They said they were going to lock me up
Would have been better if you just let the clip play... All the information you give, is what we can already gather from the title, and footage...
I keep getting these calls asking 'is Rhonda home?' When you say they have the wrong number, they say 'well, maybe you can help me...' and then go into their sales pitch. Now when they call and ask for Rhonda, I just say 'Sure. Hang on and I'll go find her...' and then set the phone down and let them wait and waste their time waiting.
If he knew, he'd turn himself in to you just to get a glimpse of Captain beautiful! 😍 ❤
The only bigger scammer than a scammer is a cop.
Love your responses!!
Drug trafficking is a government assisted thing at the borders 😂😂😂😂
She should have gave him the precinct address 😂😂😂
Pajeet POS on the line
Well done❤. Have seen this before.  😂😂😂😂.  Well done Captain ❤🇺🇸🙏.  Thank you 🙏 for your service to our communities.
Never never never give anyone you don’t know your private information.
I let the Scammer on the line, and walked to the bank. He wanted me to withdraw 500 dollars and give it to him. So l gave the phone to the bank teller so she can talk to him.
Never give that info to police as well
That Police Captain is Fantastic I love her. 😂😂😂
Pl spread awareness with headlines Indian Scammer not just scammmer
Yep I had this happen, they were going to send the sheriff to my house if I didn’t pay a credit card bill over the phone, I told them to go ahead and send the sheriff, no one showed up, plus we had no credit card.
I never answer to an unknown area code number. Idc if you're out of state, you go to my voicemail. I have my first admanment right not even to pick up the phone call.
LOL So a deputy sheriff is going to come all the way from India to "arrest me?" Ha! Ha! Ha!
These scammers need to have the book thrown at them. How about a minimum 5 yrs in jail...
She should have gave him the address of the station.
Many years ago, I received a call from a woman who told me that "they" were holding my husband and would kill him if I didn't pay a ransom.  What she didn't know is that we were going through a divorce at that time.  I told her that they could have him and good luck!       😆😅🤣😂    That felt really good in the moment, and I had a good laugh!    If I were this police captain, I would have told the caller, "well, you got me!  I'm tired of running, and you can pick me up at (address of the police station)".  Then wait outside to see who slows down....       😜😝👀
Just give them false information
That indian accent
Sounds indian...
I'd say come and get me and bring the entire squad 😂
She didn't turn the tables
I hope they tracked down the caller 😡😡
Got one of these and told him I would meet him at the local police department...of course nothing happened
Should have pulled a Khabib "send location"
No duh!!!
I would just make up numbers and let them figure them out!
That guy is crazy
Film of her not working.... impressive
He is from India.
A few years ago I received a email telling me that I was being watched and if I didn't pay an amount of money, they would kill me.   I contacted the Kansas City, Missouri FBI Office and a special agent called me back and had me forward it to her.   It had enough information for them to complete their investigation.   I heard back from her and it was located.   It was from inside the United States.   She advised me to take precautions.
Give them fake information.
I guess I missed where she turned the tables
People need to use their common since..... Be wise be smart people... Don't believe everything you hear or see.😊
Thanks for sharing officer
😅😂🤣😭
Ive been gettin these scam calls "from Chinese consulate to fix my immigration status", tho Im born+raised American; never believed it, but I do believe it's set up by CIA to help demonize China's Communist party.
Why didnt they trace the call? Every call has to be traced. The scammer could be in the US.
I would has said when I pick up this is the clown motel and the rest of the opening name: who's Joe
The guy from India they good at it
😂😂
The usual sort of scam caller
So you're going to arrest me but you don't know where I am?  Good luck, Sandeep.  It's a long boat-ride from Calcutta.  See you when you get here.  Better eat your Wheaties.
Go get em captain 👍
Air horn into the phone usually stops those kind of calls. He can report his damaged ear to his local police.
I had a call like this and I didn't give out any info either but when I was told they were sending police to arrest me I said ok, I'll put the coffee on and be waiting for them so tell them to hurry. 😂  I've also had one they said they had hacked my computer and have all my FB contacts and my addresses and phone numbers as well as passwords. Unless I send them X amount immediately they will release the video they have of me pleasuring myself. I said I would send them the $ but only if they send me a copy of the video, so I could see how photogenic I was. Darn if he didn't hang up on me immediately 😂
How about TRACING THE CALL???  Then arrest THEM!
His accent is Indian or Pakestan
if you have to warn people they shouldn't give out personal information, especially to a scammer with an Indian accent,  perhaps we should let Darwin's law deal with this.
I received a call like that and I told them catch me if you can 😂😂😂😂
I miss them calling me there just so much fun and a really bad temper
Yes Just like dealing with the cops over the phone. Come see me, I'll be here.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So cool, ma'am. This should be shown everywhere. An important subject, with a little humour😊❤
Good going Officer, proud if you ❤👍🇺🇲
"Never give out you info" she didn't even tell the guy she was a cop 😂 I would've, they probably wouldn't have believe it
Trace the call and charge him. I'm pretty sure that has Got to be illegal.
"Okay, so a sheriffs deputy is going to come here." "Weren't you asking what my address was earlier?" "Exactly where is the sheriff's deputy headed to?"
Thank you Captain 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
That was awesome I got a call like that and almost gave them my information 😢thank you 🙏🏾 for that
COOL
I love playing with them. I told one when he said they were coming to arrest me, I Said, "Oh, good. I'll pack now. Come get me." He said, "you want to be arrested?!" 😁😂 I once kept a scammer on the line for FORTY-FIVE MINUTES while I "looked" for my credit card! 😂
I would love to see the outcome of this.
This scammer has made the highest mistake of his life: You're trying to scammed a real police Officer and a Police Captain in that matter. This scammer is destined to be a poor man.
I got the same call. I gave him nothing, but I was a little worried because Im not a cop!
That is hilarious  !
I had one call and they knew where i lived and if i didnt pay some amt of money they sheriff was going to come and arrest me.  I told them to come and get me then.  At the time i was law enforcement.  They never came.😂😂
He doesn't sounds american. He's probably overseas!😊
Wait how do we know if he is a scammer and she not actually trafficking drugs
To me this is not funny at all ! I’am perplexed to know how or why our Government who is supposed to keep it citizens safe allows this to happen!
I do not answer calls I don't recognize. People with legitimate business will leave their name & number. All others I do not respond to. They report the number of people who answer their phones. Answering makes it likely you will get more calls.
Yea i play with them keeping them tied up on the phone
Well, done officer
Same thing happened to me during covid,  kept hanging up, they blew up my phone and wouldn't stop
Ok come and arrest me  ! 😂😂😂😅😅😅😊😊😊😮😮😮😮
I got this call a couple times
I had a similar call about 15 years ago saying there was a serious problem with my computer, i kept stalling the bloke asking what the problem was, he avoided all my questions, in the end, the killer blow i delivered was that id fix it myself, he said id never be able to do it, i said yes iwould, because i was the head computer systems analyst with a large insurance company (im not, im a car valeter!!!) He put the fone down FAST!!!!
I got a phone call saying we’re from the government The woman knew I had moved house and she was asking me if I was happy living here Foolish I told her I loved it and Then she said Where about is the bungalow O I will go out a take a photo it which I did Then she asked me couple of other things and then she asked me my National Insurance number I put down the phone immediately I was in my 80 year I thank God  I was so scared of answering my phone or opening the door I pray that NOBODY Goes through this xx❤👍👍
I love this. I've seen her before.
This is priceless. I hope they find this scammer.
bro this is old
Something similar happened to me. They kept threatening arrest also. I had them on the line for about an hour on speaker, going around & around, mainly to keep that person from calling others cuz we knew immediately it was scam. My husband was yelling he's calling the sheriff on his cell so we can do in person & see papers. They ended up hanging up on me when i said the deputy just pulled in my driveway to take care of everything. LoL. we did report it to the non-emergency sheriff # & within about a week there was a news report with the sheriff dept about the scam
Should've gave him the address to the station 😂😂😂
I love messing with the phone scammers put the quit calling me I guess they don't like me anymore
“You’re going to send an officer?” “Yes” “Then I’ll send him back”
Great job captain.
Did you ever tell him your job position?  I love it. Lol.
You go girl you go for it
Everything she said is just common sense... Obviously a lot of people don't have common sense or they're older folks
Her smile reminds me of Stimpy! Luv it!
You don't have to be a police captain to have fun with these guys, I do it all of the time.
The best thing to do is not to answer unknown numbers!  😊😊😊😊💜💜💜💜
Love Accent America is Such a Target 🤔😐🤫🧐
I hate scammers😮
I've had the same idiots contact me and threaten me between others from Amazon telling me that I have got thousands of dollars charged or that I've won the sweepstakes you know when they ask you for your address you should have given the police station address that would have been funny if they just showed up there
Funny good job
I learned so much last time i saw this...I now answer phone as "x police department "  then I hear click
He doesn’t even have an American accent.
just tell them their own information 🥱
😂😂😂
I've seen those things happen so many times. I have at times accidentally called a wrong number And I have accidentally answered my phone. People asked me if I live in Oklahoma, Minnesota, New York, and drive a Honda or Toyota. Which is all wrong and a bunch of lies.     Usually I know how to do a lot of impersonations. Miss Piggy. Kermit The Frog. And a crippled elderly old man and I pretend to make noises like burp, cough, and throw up.   But I have blocked 🚫 unknown numbers.
You go girl!❤️Be careful out there
and there's nothing she can do to the scammer for the crime is not happening in the United States
There is a special place in hell for these scammers who take advantage of innocent people. They will reap what they have sown.
I've got them and told them come get me
Stay in the offic,, Make caption 🤠
She is CUTE!
If the law spent as much time as this officer does joking around with these kinds of people, maybe we could get it stopped he he ha ha do something about it everybody already knows what’s going on
I remember this. She was awesome.
Why don't these people get a job
Oh yeah they tell you anything
Specially if the dude got an hindou accent or if he wants to send you billions after you’ve sends him thousands 😂
I freaking love messing with scammers, just screaming into the phone and making them think your a mental asylum patient 😂
"Absulutly"
if a caller had a very obvious accent like indian, Pakistani or Nigerian its a scam automatically
The advice I’ve always been given from my parents was to never say yes or no. When asked about a name say “that is/ is not my name”. Just avoid giving them anything worth using in general.
GOD bless you greatly... 💕
No....don't hang. Have your own fun!!! I do all time. 😅 You can scam this 65 yr old woman
Outstanding?
when SCAMMERS used to call me I told them that they reached a funeral home and they never called me again
Classic video.
After 3min. I would have given a warning ...🧐
I avoid all of these phone calls by not answering. If the number is marked, then it's somebody.I probably would like to talk to.
And people go to india for enlightenment...
Thanks!!!
And never answer a yes or no question because scammers will use your voice saying yes, or no to get into your private accounts. This is a great video. I hope a lot of people watch it.
Wow this is the first time I have agreed to what a sherif is doing ! 😂😂
And NEVER GIVE YOUR BIRTHDAY OR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. ❤
Super captain catch the scammers👌👌
I had that exact same call last year. He kept calling me back saying the police were coming to get me and he was the FBI. I thought the DEA handled the drugs.
Fantastic man fantastic
Thank you for sharing that
Love this! Ty for your service!
Great job captain. 💯🙂👊👍👌✌️🙏
❤
This is as good as Pierogi in Sarasota, Fl.  😂
I usually tell him they reached an outlaw clubhouse
"A sheriff's deputy is going to arrest you"   "Hey boss, who you srnding to arrest me?"
This happened to me also
I’ve done that before flipping on scammers is great… I love this
Lol😅😅😅😅😅
I also receive scammer and I will pretend same with them like ask his name rank and which department.
Plot twist: she actually is being charged with drug trafficking and this wasn’t a scam call
The video just arrived again.
Had a scam call. They called the house phone and after i answered, told me i had to talk to them about my amazon contract. I told him i dont have a contract with amazon. He told me i was lying. I had to be quite emphatic in the end  so i told him, "MOFO, this isnt even my house. Im just the burglar."
Now send an Officer his way and lock him up!
American strength personified.
😂😂😂😂
Wow😂😂
Wow, you didn’t do anything!!!
don't give anything to a scammer don't answer any telephone number that you don't know
The caller has a foreign accent.
If I was her, I’d burst into laughter and completely confuse the scammer 😂😂😂
Did she tell him she was a police officer? And social security doesnt have officers enforcing drug trafficking lol.
😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤
I'd have given the scammer the address of the police station and told the scammer to  send that sheriff deputy because I had some bench warrants from the DNAs (did not appear) and PVs (parole violations) from the previous week that he/she needs to be aware of.
My dad said "I'll put the coffee on"
Florida police does this scam
Why couldn't she arrest him?!
They've got all that from social platforms. Do not worry. You should trace back the call and lock them up. International cooperation please!
My dad was scammed once, I felt awful for him. Be careful everyone.
THIS HAPPENED TO ME SLSO, I KEPT HIM ON THE PHONE JUST CONNING HIM. IT WAS SO FUNNY 😆 I HAVE IT RECORDED TOO.😂
Your great. So tried of these scams.
😂😂😂
I like to give them a bunch of fake information. The longer I waste their time, the less amount of people they can scam.
Yeah the accent sounds Pakistani or Indian.
Something like this happened to me nearly two months ago! Some guy claiming to be from the Lantana (Florida) Police Department called me on the phone and told me that there was a warrant out for my arrest, because I supposedly ignored a summons for jury duty, but he said I could get out of it if I put up my own money (for bail, I think he said).   First, he told me to go to Cumberland Farms on State Road 7 here in Boca Raton, and pick up some kind of gift or bank card, only to be told by one of the owners of the store that they didn't sell the kind of card the guy on the phone was telling me about (he was still talking to me on my cellphone, telling me what to do).   Then, he told me to take a bus over to Winn-Dixie near the corner of Palmetto Park Road and Powerline Road and to put the money that I took with me into a machine of some kind (I forget what it was called), so I did (It cost me $276.00, one dollar for the bus, and the other $275.00 that I put into that machine), and that I had to wait for further instructions.   So I waited for about 15 to 20 minutes, and when no further directions came, I became suspicious. (Actually, I had a feeling almost from the beginning that this might be a scam, but I didn't know for sure, and I was afraid that if I didn't go along with it, then I WOULD be arrested). I went over to the Customer Service counter and told the lady on duty what had happened, and she explained that I had been the victim of a very common con job. A lady customer told me the same thing, that there had been a woman who came into the store a long time ago, and had fallen for the same ruse. They told me report it to the Boca Raton police.  I called the BRPD, but when I told  them where I was (still in Winn-Dixie) and where I lived, they said they couldn't do anything about it, because I was in West Boca, which was technically out of their jurisdiction, and that only the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Department could help me, so I called them instead. Since I wasn't at home, and I had no money for a taxi or a bus home, I told them I would wait for them at Winn-Dixie. (I had to describe myself and my clothes to them, so they would recognize me.)    Several minutes later, a couple of Deputy Sheriffs arrived. I told them the whole story, and they explained that what I went through is a scam that a lot of people fall for, but they added that there wasn't much of a chance of them finding the scammers, or of my ever getting the $276.00 back. (Fortunately, I had other money stashed away at home, cash that I received from a few friends and relatives for my birthday a couple of weeks before.)   When I told them that I had no cash for a bus or a cab ride home, they offered to give me a lift, but I told them that first, I wanted to see if I could get someone else to take me back. At first, I tried calling a friend of mine (who's also my landlord), but I got his voicemail and I left a message. Well, I didn't know when or if he was going to call me back soon, so I called my cousin who lives in Deerfield Beach. Her apartment is close to the border between Deerfield and Boca Raton, and the shopping plaza where this Winn-Dixie store is located isn't too far from the border, so it didn't take her too long to drive from her place to the store, although she did say that she had to tidy herself up a bit. (While I was waiting, I picked up a few groceries, because even though I had no money, I did have my EBT food stamp card, so I used that to pay for my groceries instead.) Of course, I managed to get home, thanks to my cousin.   Anyway, I should have known from the start that the guy claiming to be a Lantana police officer was really a rotten crook, because the law doesn't usually call alleged lawbreakers on the phone telling them there's a warrant out for their arrest, because that would give them a chance to make an escape.   BOY, WAS I STUPID!   I'm usually very SMART, but I guess I was too worried, and a bit too scared, to think rationally. I remember that I was so nervous, that I started to hyperventilate (breathe heavily and rapidly), as if I was having a panic attack. (I've been having anxiety problems for the past few decades.)
Thank you for doing this to help the ordinary person!!!!
Sounds like the scammer I had,  pretending to a wells fargo employee.
Don't try to even engage with them at all. The automated calls add well as they can record your voice and extract your voice identity, which they can then use to recreate your voice using AI to scam a family member into bailing you out, or any number of other frauds.
That is a man baby !!!
I HAVE Multiple xS in 2019,I won lottery 2019 ,3x's, Then after USA or There was a threat cal states thought whom I um,20/00 percent 3 X's reasonable cause threat possible ?U Know how was my money they were right afterI textes 3x's your so Gorgeous Nusing Queen thank U And All good cops

It's too bad she couldn't send a sheriff to arrest him.
My mom is going to be 84 and she knows better than to fall for that. Most calls that I get seem to be from an East Indian.
Thick Indian accent
Love her ❤️
Its very scary if alone hence find community. The wirk u might do irvretiring etc is as there in community
this has happened to me several times in the past. I START speaking in ASIAN, but I don't really speak any Asian at all - EVER ! oh its Hellarius, so funny. Or I speak like A 2 year old child. Im A BLUE BOOK CAJUN QUEEN,and an actress. I lead em on and on. Its SO DANG Comical. I always have Fun with it 100%. I Love The FOREIGN Language skit I do to them! HA! Whata Hoot 2 give em the non. Emergency Police Phone number, the Police DEPT. Address, and GREAT other INFO. they scam So Stupidly its A Hoot.💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖😇
That sounds like the guy from the Border Patrol who called me and told me they were coming to get me. I told him to hurry up because I need a vacation.
Me and my mom have a hilarious memory of one of these calls that she got around ten years ago 😂 to this day all we have to do is say "Press 9 now" in an Indian accent and we will start laughing.
This would make a great commercial or teaching tool.😊
Who is filming her? How did they know to film for this?
Oh the irony
So true
What a strong, smart & beautiful Police Captain!  💗💓💜
My favorite was when they called my friend in the middle of the night. They said he needed to give out cash for his grandson who was in jail. He talked to them for awhile, then when they threatened him again. He said " Leave the sob in jail. I've never liked him anyways!"
Something similar happened to me. I asked what his name was. I took his number and turned it in to the attorney generals hotline.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Just don't answer  a number even if it says verfide. If it's a number, you  don't  no exspshlly  from another  state  don't answer  it stay smart stay safe.
I KEPT getting these phone calls. They said my electricity company had "flagged" my account for excessive electricity usage. This is impossible. I am single, only temperature control my bedroom and I haven't cooked at home for a year now. These people were obviously scammers. I kept telling them I am not interested and to please quit calling me. They CONTINUED to call me. Finally I had it and blew up at the guy by asking "who is my electricity provider?" And I kept saying over and over again while he tried to weasle out of the question by calling me crazy.... I never heard from them again!
So ... go do your job n write someone up for ... and ... U laugh
I hope that they were able to trace the call and arrest the phone scammer.
GIVE JOE BIDEN'S ADDRESS.. 😂🎉🎉
Just don’t talk or better yet answer the phone ☎️
Did she ever tell him exactly who he was threatening? If she did, he probably didn't believe her, but I'd love to see his face if he realized he had picked on the wrong woman. 😅
In the adjoining office I heard the bail bondsman answer the phone “Sheriff’s Department “ they immediately hang up!!😂
So she had a camera waiting on a scammer in her office to call so she could record everything I think this was acting
The scammers do this bcz they do find very stupid elderly people!An elderly relative mailed $5,000 to someone she did not verify! Followed his instructions to the letter! I am embarrassed for her!!
that is me
Nah I find joy in wasting these guys' time.
We already know not to entertain such scammers.
I work for a local law enforcement agency and I've received this kind of scam call on my work phone, which I answer wil the name of my agency and the unit I work in.  Sometimes I have to repeat myself more than once before they stop talking and hang up. 😁
Im just gonna pretend to be a 90 yr old demented guy
This is an old clip that never gets old.
She absolutely should have tracked the call or set him up in some way to catch the guy. Then at least the public would be protected against his scam & get a break from the police piracy on their way to work!
When you hear an Indian accent with English names, run 🏃‍♀️
The officer is correct, logical, patient (, funny & cute) !
I want to see the end where she tells him she's a police captain.
I don't tell government employees any of my information over the phone. To hell with everyone. I'll be gahtdamn. 😊❤
Never say Yes they record it and use it against you
I've said but I thought you had my records 😂😂😂😂hang up every time
Having dealt with left wing California politicians, I have a fully functional bulls#!£ detector. I  hope she has a caller I D readout to get scammer's phone number.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Several years ago a scammer caught me on a good day. I pretended to go along with my personal information being compromised. I was pretending to scream and panic and gave him a false Social Security number and made up a checking account number and kept begging for him to spare me. I had a blast!😂
I was going to be arressted to... first time I freaked.(they said the Mounties & IRS).. second time I know the government knows I don't have money to arrest me so I chilled😮😅😅😅😅
They tried to do that to me 3 or 4 times and I was so scared I gave them my address and then I told them that I will give the information to the officers. I hang up and call 911 and told them. Next day it was all over the news from Seattle, advising elderly to be careful and the news narrated my experience
That’s so funny
😂😂😂😂 biggest ass English accent 😂😂
I get them all the time usually from IRS , i like playing along with them
BRAVO to you, Ma’am!!!  Too bad you can’t put a trace on the caller and arrest his thieving a$$!!! 😡
This is years old. Still good!!
I've had the same thing happen to me twice'  don't give them any information and keep them on the on the phone as long as you can and have some fun.  They won't call back.
Did you get him
The whole coversation was really good to watch.
If something similar like this happens ask for a badge number the number should be around 4-6 digits
The accent gives him away
Yeah, well I told the last scammer that I had an 800 number that he could call me on and I gave him the 800 number for the FBI.
Why didn’t she trace the call and have them all và arrested
Good job please captain
why did they post this in 2024, this video is from 2019???
You can't trust ANYONE!!! I never give out any information on myself. The scammer will get into your bank records and steal anything you have ...
Pov me trolls scammer 😂 useing a voice that sounds like a 911 call 😂
my way is to just have fun and be extremely toxic and give them a taste of a cod BO2 lobby which r the most radioactive places.
Instead of laughing Mabey you could had tried to get something from them to stop some of these scammers. Cause they sure do steal from a lot of Americans. Do like payback scammers. They try to get the people who take from us.
I had that done to me too, 😂
Sounds like he comes from the same place they all scammers come from
I’ve gotten a few; just told them to send the officer. You should hear the language after that….
I want to know why she didn't put a trace on that call immediately and keep him on the line long enough for them to do what they have to do to get this bastard off of the airwaves and into the prison of hell
The video is from 2019. But it is 2024 and I just got one of those calls a couple months ago.
I get calls from numbers I don't have as contacts people that I know but never answer numbers I get that I don't know just let it ring.
I'm NOT that STUPID I would NEVER give anyone any INFORMATION  NO FRIGGIN WAY
Thank you officer 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 ❤❤❤😊
Absolutely Indian.
Good one
That's true right 💯💯💯💯💯💯
The accents of the scammers is the #1 Red Flag!
I quote Arnold Schwarzenegger movies. GET TO THE CHOPPAH!!
Indian accent is a red flag
Why this captain wasting her time talking to the scamer ? Why not trying to tracking scammers  down!!! Waste  ours taxes  payer ???  Hang up the phone no more conversation  with scammers !!! Stop talking to scammers  !!!
Thank you for sharing this information.
But it’s ok to give them my atm card, right?
Once when I was a young teenager a scammer called me, to tell me my car's extended warranty had run out.  I was to young to even get my license, so I asked them what imagery car they were talking about.
This video is sooo old
Really would like hear whole call and she confirms she's a police Captain 😂
So, nothing's happened since 2019 🤨
So what happened hopefully they got the dude and arrested his butt put him in jail.
I love messing with these scammers. To much fun 😂
I love this...funny but a learning lesson
When i get these 😢 tell them ill be waiting on the ftont porch.  I've even called them back a couple of days later, asking when they were coming to arrest me, as I've been sitting on the porch for the last 48 hrs waiting and im getting really tired.
THANK YOU I BEEN IN THERE BEFORE ❤CALL 😊
Claims she's going to be arrested but doesn't have her address....LOL!!!
Hahahababahahaha good one Captain! I did once my self
Priceless
They really target the elderly real bad.
Thank you for sharing
AMAZING!! Great Captain!
🙌
What a dumb scammer!  He calls the police station to tell them they"re going to be arrested.   Thats very funny.
I had something like this happen before...said my SSN # was suspended lol!didn't end well for him...frustrated the hell outta him lol!
That happened to me 2 year's ago. I didn't give them any info.
😂😂😂
😂😂
Have you seen the new AI that can mimic people's voices to the tee? The population cannot be trusted with that kind of stuff.  Los Angeles is a hellhole.
Best way I've found is to say I'm at work so they'll need to arrest me there. They ask where that is and I say my local police station. They hang up so fast. 😂
They Always Pick On The Elderly People With Their Heavy Heavy Accent. My Poor 82 Year Old Uncle Believed This Scammer.
Smart woman.
These scammers always have the same accent, I don't need to say any more. 🤔
I got the same call and I recorded it. His name is Daniel Ricardo and I reported it to the FCC, but I cursed him out before he asked her credit card info.
If you hear an Indian accent with an English name, put the phone down.
Why couldn’t she have it traced? Probably somewhere in India?
I've gotten calls similar to this and I don't hang up I talked to him because they're absolute freaking morons.
Find out the scammers address and state as yours
Oh, say to him, especially with me, it was to see you to be via into a suit known that having
She should have went and had and Trace the call and catch the guy😂😂😂❤
Why can't you trace the call & have the creep arrested?
No, you hyped this, as usual--unfortunately, she DIDN'T, wasn't ABLE to, turn the tables on him. (Great PSA, though.)
Lmao
Can she have him arrested?
I love scaring the hell out of scammers
I had this call too I knew it was a scam because I saw caller ID indicated the call was from Quebec Canada He said he was calling from Social Security  I said wow Social Security is  In Canada too ? I gave the guy random numbers lol I gave him a false address  I scammed him
😂😂
One time in the past had one of those phone scams. Saying if I don't give details they would send the police after me. I told them "OK, I'll be here waiting for them"... Guess what I'm still waiting for them to show up. lol
“My SSN is 1. My address is 1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington DC 20500. Let me know when they’re on their way to arrest me!” 🤭
Also never say yes in any format....they will use it
😲😂🤣😅👍
Great job 👍 😊
Did you notice the scammer's accent?? He is calling from overseas ...
There's a Special Place in Hell For Scammers!
That happens to me
This video is priceless. Kudos to this beautiful Police Captain. Loved this😂 ❤🇺🇸🚑
I was told once if I didn't cooperate with them my social security number would be canceled and I wouldn't be able to work or get a job, that was 8 yrs ago and I've had 3 different jobs since then Lol
Good work Mam!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lmao what a stupid scammer 😂😂 You think they would do a little look-see into who they're talking to
Other scams include : Can't deliver a package due to incomplete info, you're being sued (complete wiith case number) - you can confirm this with your local courthouse anyway!
duh 😂
How do you fall for something like this
Muslim voice, you think they would hire a white person
Haha good cop love here 😊😊😊😊
isn't this sort of crime considered to be domestic terrorism?:it should be!!!!!
It's common sense. Why would you even give out personal info at all?
BRILLIANT 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 ❤😂😅🎉😂🎉😅🎉😂❤❤
I dont answer unknown numbers period.
Everytime I get a scam call, I play with them and they always hang up
She should say..."  go ahead and send them.  They work for me anyway."
Think I would have fun with, just like the captain did😊😅😂
My daughter got a call and they told her that a car that she rented was for with thousands of dollars and pounds of drugs and they were going to lock her social security number if she didn't call a number and send money
PCH SCAMMERS JUST TRIED TO GET ME. Even tried to friend me on FB. Sounded sooo real.
Captain is a sweetheart
My Mil was scammed and wouldn't believe it when her daughter and granddaughter told her they were just scamming her
Well done
A sheriff deputy is going to come arrest the captain. Hahaha
That's right
There’s more to this video!!! She gives him the police station address lmao
Ow a whistle in their ear just before you hand up.
The whole video is great.  Saw this a few years ago
Watch out for the fake IRS they told me I was going to be arrested. It was so funny. Don't give anyone any info about yourself. 😊
Is than an accent from the sub-continent? 😂
There is a God
My husband is the constable for our area and he has the best time with these calls
🙏
Great job young Lady! That was hilarious!
RIGHT On, SISTER
I started telling the guy that this was such a huge fake call; he wasn’t real, the call wasn’t real, and that everything he said was a big fat lie. He thought I was crazy and they never called back 🤣
Turns the tables eh?  Wouldn’t that mean something like having the call traced and the scammer arrested?  Looks to me like she simply didn’t comply with his demands for personal information. I see no table turning here.
That happens to me twice! I was scared but a friend of mine is a police officer who told me what to do they stop finally
I always Answer sheriffs department how can I help you
You realise ..the scammer doesnt give 2 farts if shes a cop or the governor of california... He really doesnt
😳😳😳
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Let me guess   on the other end is Officer John Robinson  with Indian accent 😅
Hahaha hahaaaaa
I love playing with scammers and wasting their time.
This Is Out Of Control And It's Happens Everyday Every Minute Sad 😔
Brilliant!
The scammer sounds like a foreigner.
Someone tried scamming my grandma once. They told her I was in a car accident and needed money to fix the car. She almost agreed, but luckily my uncle was there at the time and told her "No, don't do that! It's a scam! Joe (not my real name) doesn't have a car! He doesn't even have a driver's license!"
This is so funny. I love it.😊
BTW,  if anyone calls saying you as in an accident. My reply is always "That was F'in quick!!! It only just happened!!..." 😂
I keep wondering why my debt collectors keep sounding they're from newdeli 😂
Imagine the scammer who did that is watching this  :o
Pure Indian accent😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂 if he ain't got a surprise 😂😂😂
This is about ten years ago 😂
WoW Dhe is great..love her...good work..❤😂❤❤
A tired story for tired news, if you cant tell someone is trying to take advantage and fail to ask your own security questions you deserve to be scammed. Sorry but its survival of the fittest. If your brain cant process lies or basic conversation your kinda hopeless.
She won't give her social but expecting the likes of us to hand ours out to them
I interrupt the call.  I never answer unknown numbers.
I say they need to make a TV show about these scammers and how people mess with them
People from India and Filipinos big thifs
I love it!  Boy did he get the wrong number or maybe the right number!
That smile of hers is awesome.
Yea i got one of these to i watch scam bait channels so i knew the assignment and got silly with it! to my sister got one and if any remote assess app team viewer or the like is mentioned *DO NOT FOLLOW THROUGH!*
ye budhi kon hai
Unreal.
Folks Common Sense goes a long way😂
Safest thing to do: if you don't recognize the number don't answer. If the caller has real business with you they will leave a message and you can call them back. If you get a "fraud alert", call your bank at the number on your card.
She is soooo perfect
Great job, Captain!😂
The sad thing is, that is the way most real police act also!
Did you at least TRACE THE CALL???
Too funny😂😂😂😂😂
I'm going to try to make eat and drink ❤❤❤❤
I used to live for those calls. They stopped too long ago.
Wow! That’s funny!
This is so old
You should just never answer a unknown
Absolutely....sounds like an Indian scammer from Noida
Hilarious❤
JAMAICA
Thank you.
So a police will cone to her home. Yes she wiil come to her own home and arrest herself. 😂🤣
Another butt watering event made worse by bad acting
I HAD SIMILAR CALL FEW MONTHS AGO LOL I TOLD HIM THE SAME THING
Indian accent, obviously in india, sending popo round  😂😂😂😂
Man to be honest I would be saying something wild if I was in her position I would say no you I wouldn't be lying now would I.
I usually scream into my phone and they hang up for me 😂
I always tell them that I'm giving their number to the FBI
Love her but this is so true
I’ve watched this several times before when it has been on my feed. Love it!
Dainty, I always fib on date of birth etc.  Tell them I have sold all the drugs, all sorts of nonsense.
But what if it’s real tho
Trace the call..
Sad thing is elderly ppl that don’t have social media might fall for it…
I kept calling them back ad nauseum and asked how THEY liked it.  Haven't heard from them since.
😂😂😂😂😂
she's a cute lady and I'm not a big fan of cops
The same thing happened to me
Excellent Job 👍👏👍😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂❤😂😂 Dumb Bunny 😡 i Hate these Dammmmm Calls 📞😂😂😂😂😂
So no one can find out about this scammer an arrest him.
I had similar experience my bank accounts were “ frozen “  and police is after me and my family and house is under lien     🤨
So one of her own employees is going to come arrest her 🤔🤔🤔  Well at least it will be a short journey 😂😂😂
Scammer, very foolish!!!
This man needs to stop yapping
Thank you . Have taken your advise and got no more scams xx❤❤
Thats funny hope they were caught
They come from India.
❤👍❤
Give the phone to a toddler telling them Santa is on the phone lol
Next time give him the police station addresss
I love it ❤ Good job
😂
😊
Bro if i got a scammer call i would waste his time by giving him a random address and a random ssn
Let’s be honest here, she doesn’t seem very bright and would be better off handing this to a qualified professional
First personal n with that haircut to do something good
Why is the man talking over the video ¿ i love this lady
You did a great job
Indian or Pakistan person accent
Yep I had the same call and they would close my account 😂😂
Somebody you know or play on your phone
I swear this one is no one else but a Nigerian scammer.
She'sy copying the original girl who does this.
I had a scammer call me a few times and he was actually using a phone number that belonged to a friend of mine that was a deputy sheriff the only reason I answered my phone was because I thought It was my friend calling
Facts 💯 %
The scammer is Indian
I like to try to sell them stuff or scream randomly into the phone for as long and loud as I can. Thinking of buying an air horn for future calls.
If u think this is funny watch kitboga
By the way people fun fact over over 40% scammers or from India and this one is from India I can tell from its voice 😂😂😂
The scammers hate me
Sherriff Captain Your Amazing And Thank You For All Information To Help Us Citizens GOD GOD BLESS YOU SO MUCH
She shoulda just said “I’m a police captain, return to sender.”
I have a police whistle by my phone.  Hey, go deaf, I don't care!!!  I don't get calls anymore
My dad got one of these and he tricked them with a fake voice and fake name and they were asking for his will or something
😂😂😂
I woulda said something with a 6,21,3,11,25,15,21. Just turn those numbers into letters (ex a=1, z=26 ect. Basically their number in the alphabet) abd add a space in between the 11 and 25
Why does she got that karen hair style
Good job Captain. I hate scammers.
This is when you tap into Bart Simpson's Best, prank calls.  🤣🤣🤣
*INDIAN ACCENT*You will be arrest for 300 years💀
Love this
Theres also a scam that they have uour son or grandson in jail and needs you to pay bail. Losers who abuses the stupid and the elderly
What is your name? None of. None of who? None of your business
Indians
Couldn’t that phone call? Be traced so that these people could get arrested
I got one of those calls and they wet saying they found a rented car that was in my name and it had 50 pounds of drugs in it
Great acting skills officer. Love your style. 😂
King 🤴 👑 Queen 🤴 👑 👸 raise the bar higher
I'm glad YOU Showing what's been going ON THANK YOU 🤗🤗
Unntil i disappeared in hospitals
Threatened me constantly
Mississippi
That happen to me once,they called me and said I owe money to the IRS😊
I always say, "911 how can I assist you?"
She is so wise. Never give them the answer to anything. Karma will take care of him sooner or later. The sooner the better .Smh.
The absolute joy on her face is so good 😂
They think everyone is stupid 😂😂😂
Also gave a scammer the address of local police department 😂
You can also pretend to be a cop or pretend your house is a local police/fire department, works like a charm for me lol
Captain your so funny
This video is years old.
😂😂😂
If you don’t recognize the phone number, don’t answer your phone! It’s just that simple if it turns out to be somebody you wanted to call you they will leave a message if they don’t leave a message block the call and delete it
Always a good laugh and its world wide silly indians
They tried to scam me with this trick. I said come on over to my house when you have a beer.😮😂.
Oh boy,heres my bank account,ready
Record the call and take it to the police
Scammer chilling in india just casually on his shift.
Every time a scammer calls me I pretend that I'm a voice recording and that I do include in the recording that if they call from West Bengal or Kolkatta India that the MUST include their real name and phone number they hang up before I finish my recording and also I pretend the I'm from either the FBI and or CIA it scares them every single time
I would have been like here's my address come on down and it be the police station/jail 😂
What's the scam ?
dont hang up, waste there time and troll.tiem.with misinformation its legal
Where is the drug ? Tell me y go ahead and get some
I don’t answer
Want to do the other friends come pick up the phone I'm going to sing baby shark play annoying the hell
So trace him? Naah who cares
My brother was scammed for 15,000 dollars because of such activities,
The usual kumar
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The replied “absolutely “ was the key point 😂😂😂
They always have the same accent
I love the look of glee on her face!
The scammer looks like Indian.
I. Been there, l scared to death
They should of tracked the phone that’s what I thought she was going to to do
Hilarious..
Why not try and track the call?
Um I got one where they were giving me food from uber eats
This just shows how they have no idea who they're talking too!!! So stupid.😡
I will give it of course - a fake one 😂😂
You forgot don't give out your phone number they can trace that back to your social security number.
Indian
Cat get off the couch
😂😂😂😂❤
Thanks for the laugh
My birth date 4 1 1910 yeah im kinda old
I have had a few calls like this.  I said ok ill wait for him to get here. But i drove to the police station 😂 Another time i answered the phone, Joes pool hall, you stab'Em we'll slab'em 😂
aren't they allowed to trace that call or do they need more red tape?
That's right😊
I love when people troll scammers
Ma'am you should have given him diddys address. 😁
Tell you will be to pick him up 😮
I had a lot of those scammer. I either yell at them or start talking my second d language and cause them out. I also give them the phonecnumber of fraud FBI.
Too funny !
I remember watching this full length video when it was uploaded to YouTube
Good job for Real ❤
Thank You so much!!! I've gotten several of these calls. 😢
Also important: The police should always call in the language of your country, so if they speak english but you don’t life in a english country it’s most likely a scam :)
Why can't you find them
People should know this though it’s COMMON SENSE PEOPLE!!! If someone is demanding ur ssn or ur address you really think it’s for something good?!
Oldest video ever....
I was getting calls from scammers from Malaysia so every call from that country I would ignore they kept trying for months but eventually gave up !!
Of course it's a Indian on the line....
🌹👍👍👍🌹😂😂😂/I Love it 🌹✋ thank you 🌹✨
I never answer if I don't know the number
❤❤❤❤❤,,👍👍👍👍👍💯💯💯💯💯💯❤❤
Yup, my birthday is 4/20/69
My french teacher said to start speaking french to scammers, good way to practice!😂
You have to fight the scammers harder...
I hope he get caught..
I use an Indian voice and mess with them.
She should've been tracing the call 🤓
Had a scammer ring me, I said just a moment there’s someone at the door. I put the phone down and left . Picked It up an hour later, no one there.
This is really interesting to listen to the scammer. He was unbelievable.🎉 what a creepy thing a creep!!!
That is one heavy indian accent with the "Absolutely"
Blud outside edition is better
Super lesson, you really messed his head!
😂😊😅
Idian accent means its a scammer
I love toying with scammers. 😂
I would've given the address to the police department.
GREAT smile.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
😮😢😂😂😂
Excellent piece of work
I'll just say I was born on Feb 30th 8000 B. C.
Well done Officer.
I live in the UK and same thing happened to me
It's got to be a foreigner on the other side of the line.
I cant say that I wasn't a victim but on the app discord but the very nice and awesome people from the company got my account back
Staged, but very very useful indeed 👍
Too funny!! A$$hats.,
Indian sar
She has a Karen haircut
I hope she had that phone call tapped
I had this same call. I laughed at caller to. People do anything to get you.🤬🤬
I always talk to them when they call and just waist there time by just saying random things
I love to mess with scammers I feel longer u can keep on the phone less ppl they can really scam
😂😂😂
They do this to the elderly a lot!!
He sounded like his name is Kevin😅
Never give out your date of birth, social security number or your address but just make something up that's what I'd do they won't know a thing
Haha Haha haha haha 😄😄😢
I would love to have fun with a scammer by ordering pizza or better yet say i am in outer space visiting the space station 😂
Never say yes or yeah
You did a good job
Also never say yes
why not track the scammer while doing some word play with him so he can be arrested if the scammer is just around America
I would love to see her arresting the guy
Two towns away from mine.
I loved the part where she turns the tables on the scammer…
Just give them fake information 😂
The police officer has now the same feeling that a cat has when playing with a mouse! 😂🐀🐈
He made her day! Lol
Ma'am please tell me yal found and  arrested Akbar !
Also never say "yes" they can use that out of context as evidence that you agreed to something (that you didn't really agree to)
I would give them a bunch of false information and then the address for the FBI Headquarters building.
Gee did someone get in Shape
I got to call a couple years ago from someone saying that there was a warrant out for my arrest in Texas but I don't live in Texas. I was being arrested because someone took credit cards out in my name and ran up round 2 million of debt. All I said was like I'll have my lawyers contact your lawyers 😆😆😆
I had someone with a raging Indian accent that I was getting a massive tax return (which I knew was wrong), so I took down all the info, then rang the tax department & gave them all of it. I hate these guys.
Wasnt this like 5 yrs ago?
That is super funny.😂
My dad always taught me to never say yes, yeah, etc. as they may be able to use that against you
I like keeping these people on the phone when I don't have anything better to do. I'll waste their time.
She has a lot more composure than I! I could never hold a straight face!
Excellent  Job.
And with technology advancing so fast it might be best to say nothing at all in case someone tries to clone your voice. Sometimes they even record you saying yes or no (okay, alright, confirm, etc.) and use that as voice confirmation. I’ve heard of it being done.
This video is 5 years ago. But, still funny. 😂
Fun fact , although some can’t tell , the scammer is Indian and another surprise fact is that the US can’t arrest Indian minors even if they done a crime that would send them to juvenile detention the same goes for most adults and as for Indian immigrants they can come in the us with a citizenship without waiting for years, it’s because the India has strong ties with the US that they give preferable treatment to Indians
WE ALREADY KNOW THAT. SO YOU CAN'T TRACE  THAT CALL AND ARREST THAT PERSON BY YOU BEING A SHERIFF. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED YOU TO DO SHERIFF DEPUTY.
I don't answer any numbers I don't know. Then I google the number to see if it was of any importance.
I love messing with them lmao it's so much fun when they get angry 😂
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Could she have tracked his call? With all the resources at the station, could she have done more than record?
"okay sounds good, send them right now. I'll wait."
I also got one of those. Crazy scam!
Her little giggle is so funny
The sad thing is that people fall for this scam everyday
Yes , iv been there with this same call .  It almost same like the same guy . It went on with me for almost 2 weeks.
Indians 😂 omg
Just happened to me yesterday.  Scammer trying to tell me I was being scammed by another party. And both people I spoke to were of Indian decent
Ring Ring, Pakistan calling...
I am an Operating Room nurse. During surgery the phone rang, it was an external call which happens occasionally; people misdial their number. I answered it and it was a scammer with surprise surprise, a foreign accent. Two guesses which accent
All of my incoming calls show up on my tv screen. If I don't recognize the name, or number, I just let it ring. Most times they hang up.
I would have gave the address to the police department 😊
Don’t answer calls from people you don’t recognize period!!
So now the police will do something about this
Lmfaooo had one of them called 10 years ago still waiting for the IRS to come arrest me since they claim they were lol 😂
Especially to any Indian on the phone
It may seem racist but idgaf  When I answer the phone if I hear an Indian accent, I hang up  Like come on you expect me to believe the person with that thick Indian accent is named "Nancy" 🤣😂🤣😂
Y can't the cop get the caller  on line to get him arrested idu
Nah it’s fun to just troll the scammers
I give them yours lol 😂
Do you recycle news? Or you're just late?
Karen so funny
😂😂😂
If I didn't have phone anxiety I would mess with those scams
Yep sounds like India
India fake call centers.
For someone who has a karen haircut, she's really cool 😅
I had one of those calls come in on the work line saying I had a warrent out for my arrest. I said great I'm at work come get me.
She is so pretty ❤
Nigerians voice accent100%
Women ask me for money I delete them.
Who would fall for this
She should have had other police come in like "get on the ground"
Kitboga enters the chat
put an air horn up to the phone and push the button 👍🏾
I scam them back and keep them on the phone as long as possible by pretending to be a religious organization that’s having a BOGOF special on baptisms. One guy ended up giving me all his bank card information before asking the “price”. When I told him $399 he started yelling that he didn’t have that much money and “Cancel it! Cancel it!”. 😁
I wondered when this would happen..😅 Shes so good.  😂
That’s why I let all calls go to voicemail
Nice 👍👍 job officer
That's hilarious
Sucks they cant stop these Phone Scammers
This happened to my baby sister who had just got out of prison. She was lock up for almost 5 years and has schizophrenia she was doing well because she was medicated in prison she almost ran from the halfway house she was in to give every dime she had to this guy in gift cards. It took me 2 hours to talk her down.
If you want to do something nice for someone today, waste the scammers time and talk to them for as long as possible.  That way they can't call grandma and steal her retirement.
He has a foreign accent  I get that a lot
He seems to be a scammer from India they know for scamming
Indians
Sad to say they operate out of North East India.... they put all of our legitimate IT SERVICES  to shame .
I would’ve given him the address to the White House
Take her advise and don’t respond to any unknown text, email, or call if you do have to say nothing or have some fun don’t click on any links and if you do accidentally say something that’s tied to you in any way hope it’s not enough
how did she keep it together so well?? if that was me I’d be on the floor cackling too much to talk 😂
😂🤣
I gota call like dat 4 drug smuggling & $$ laundering & he thot I was sum1 from Rockwall Tx so I laffd & told em 2 come & get me & gav d info 2 d FBI !!!🙃
My phone identifies scam calls so that I can block them but if I ever answered one of the calls and it was of this nature I'd have fun with them. 😂
wow you really got em
My brother's dad was scammed in a similar situation. It wasn't drug trafficking but something they said he'd be arrested for if he didn't cooperate. He ended up losing about $18k. I hate that they often get one over on some people...sadly it's often the elderly.
They called me too same thing drug trafficking lol over 2 million dollars worth lol i was like well dude 😎 were is the drugs please 🥺 😆
During the lock down. I played with them for days. They sent me a fake check. I kept telling them they needed to cash app ME !! For gas to get to the bank ...
Pretty valid claim to make against a cop tbh
She didnt really "Turn the tables" on the scammer....  Jim Browning turns the tables on scammers! That man is an artist. 😉
Why not give them the address to the local FBI or an address with the police waiting?
Couldn’t she keep him on the line until the FBI got involved?
Was that an indian police officer? Lol
Tax payers money at work
how many more people do you think would be scammed if the scammers didn’t have a strong accent
Its unfortunate how many people fall for things like this. Only advice we can give once you give up your social is contact social security and keep an eye on your credit reporting agencies. As for bank info if its just a debit you can close it as stolen but if its account and routing number you have to close your entire account transfer your money to a new one which can be a pain same proccess as a lost check.
listen I'm just going to be fully real. If I answer the phone and I hear an Indian accent on the other side there's an 80% chance that that call is not important.
She thought she ate
She is the manager to end all managers.
Dude, I get these scam calls all the time at work. The last one I got I had the guy on the line for an hour thinking he was going to get 4,000 bitcoin! 😂
I usually just answer scammers like this. Local area police department. How can we help you? they usually just hang up and never call again.
I wind them up when they call me
She looks like shes the one who asks for the manager rather than being the manager 💀
That's crazy 😧
According to the voice scammer is from India
How do they even send police to her location if they don’t even know their location? That’s dumb of the scammer
She should let the scammer got her office adress 😂😂😂
I knew it was a scam when he said the first word (absolutely)
I just pretend to be really scared then say I'm gonna pass the phone to someone who's responsible. Then as they wait I just mute the call and go on about my day
Prajeet
this is from like 2016 wtf?
This is obvious to most people, but for some it's not. the media should make it known more often. This is what not to do. Give out your information. but no, we only hear about after the money is all gone. That's when the Media mightl report it.
My mom got this phone call and it sound like the same Phelepino guy
Sounds like I am going to get arrested by an Indian police officer in United States
We had these call my store sonone time i answered as police department it was hilarious 🤣
I wish it showed at the end that they tracked him and arrested him
My wife got multiple scammers during her 8 and a half years on the force. She went as far as saying this: “You’re currently speaking to a police officer. A police officer will be at your location shortly” 95% of them hang up. One scammer was so nasty and rude when my wife revealed who she really is, she went to the scammer’s location and arrested him for identity theft and fraud
If I don't recognize the number, I just say, "County sheriff department, what is the nature of your emergency?" and they always freak out and hang up on me 😂😂😂
this is so old.. people keep reposting it so msny times
911 dispatcher here. They may even know your name and/or address.
If anyone ever calls you and it sounds like they're calling you from India it's definitely a scammer. 🧔
I just laugh when I get connected they always hang up. I get like 10 calls a week. They hate me :)
I like to toy with them, giving them everything they want, but it’s just whatever pops into my head. Had one guy call back, angry that I gave him false info! So much fun … 🇨🇦🖖🏻🇨🇦
Aways indians
I also heard that you must not say yes or no because they can literally use those words
I would have given him the police station address and then see what he would do.
I received the same scam call but the scammers used voice changers along with the names of real police officers, spoofed the local sheriff department’s phone number, and didn’t ask for any personal information. The scammers tried to convince me that my bank accounts had been used by the “drug traffickers” and that my account contained dirty money that had to be sent to them in order to be cleaned. I’ve never been a gullible person but they had me convinced until they said I needed to send my money over Zelle lol
I had this shady job offer wanting my DOB. I wouldn't give it.
When a scammer call me I speak a different languages.
Typical scammer ahh behavior
😂😂😂😂😂 I love it!
Never trust these Kumars 😂😂
Thanks for sharing
When someone with an Indian accent calls, he is definitely a scammer
Tell them to call Mickey Mouse for all of your information.   They don’t call you back.
"Absolutely"
Captain Karen
I be messing with these fools 😂
My dumbazz father would definitely fall for these scammers
Oh my god it's been five years already! I remember when this video was recommended to me just 3 days after inside edition posted it!
Oh the irony. 😂
I am from the microsoft
dude, this video is like 5 years old or so...and your just now posting it? xd
Why is this important?
The advice she gave: “Just don’t get scammed”
I do that to those scammers all the time .
The ANZ Bank (Australia) threatens, harasses in order to hide criminal activities they partake in, they also pervert/ corrupt every Sector of Government & Law (+ Courts)... despite being the largest AU Bank. First hand experience!
U should have kept him on the line long enough so u could find out where he was @. Then maybe u could have arrested them, because u know there is more then 1.
When they talk like that then its a scam. I answer and when I hear them talk, Im relieved its not a real creditor. I laugh and hang up.
The caller has an Indian accent.
looking like a karen and being a cop at the same time is crazy 💀
Well of course its Indian
My mother was in the nursing home for rehabilitation. On the drive there I got a call that the IRS was sending the police after me. I had to call the number they gave me or, "God have mercy on your soul."  I giggled. It helped relieve the stress I was feeling during a hard time. I never called the number I was given, and no police ever came for me. Ha!
🤣🤣🤣
Keep them on the line but yet y'all aren't doing anything to stop this
Don't hang up.. troll them.. trol lol😅
She did an excellent job!!!
Vell Vell Vell
I just went through that .omg
I always waste their time. The more time talking to me the less time they scam some elderly person.
😂😮
lol
It's easy to track them down but the problem is they have business permit and inside the building with security.   I don't know why some government's allowed this scammer's to rent a building and had business permit.
That is our world now how sad🫠
"Come get me i have something for you"
every lesbian haircut
Whyd u guys reupload this was like years ago
😂😂😂😂😂
I wish I would get a phone call like this 😂😂😂
OLD
Sick!!!!
I kept a scammer on hold waiting for my bank account info. 😂 was tryna scam me into thinking I won a a trip on a cruise
Fun fact: You can like someone’s comment on a video by double clicking it.
I always try to keep scammers on a call as long as I can.  Hopefully it prevents someone else from getting scammed. Once I trolled one so well he put the pieces together I lived 601 Elm street and my husband’s name was Fred Krueger it was great.
i would’ve said i’m a ilife captain and we have UR location
currently current
They have a New Delhi...
The accent😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Heres how you deal with scam calls: Answer the phone with "Thank you for calling scammer payback (nearest city) office, how can I help you?"
She pranked the hone scammers just like what that old lady did two weeks ago.
Debt Collectors also do the same
Why is Inside Edition so late to everything? This happened 5 years ago.
Oh I just answer and moan into the mic😌
She still ends up being scammed lol
Sometimes when I get bored I like to mess with the scammers, try it its fun 🥴
Was this was a long while ago.
"I'm going to be charged with drug trafficking?" "ค๒ร๏ɭยՇєɭץ"
Ty officer obvious
Would have loved to see more. I thought she was keeping him online so they can pinpoint the scammer's location, and wanted to see the scammer get busted. But he probably isn't in the US.
get to work
Sister nieee ooh London
Sigma Karen lol
This happened yrs ago. Not sure why it's showing up on inside edition now
Someone needs to be arrested for that haircut.
so we're bringing up old news now? lol
If they can keep them on the line that long, then they should also be able to trace them !!! Do something about these AH’s !!!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Oh wow rhis is funny 😂
Soon as I heard the accent😂😂😂😂😂😂
I got one of those calls a few years ago.. i gave them false info and tild them to send the police to a false address...ill be waiting with tea and crumpets 🤣🤣🤣
“What is your name?” :”Absolutely”  Edit: oh thanks for 3k likes
We need an update with this case and the Capt.
Kk I guess
she can get it
You gotta love it. You gotta love it. If they have an accent, you know they’re scammers. The whole thing is I keep them on the line give them fake bank account numbers and because the longer you keep them on the line then that’s one less phone call they make .
Mk another day on the job... can i have your address? -police station oh wai- FBI OPEN UP
it's Saar all the time.
Should've gave the police departments address. Let the scammer figure it out as he goes.
She should of gave him the address to the police station 😂
I mean, to be fair. She is with the police force she has a high likelihood of actually being a drug trafficker.
Nothing new from their kind
Great cop for taking the time to help out those who might fall victim 💯💯
I had the same thing happen to me they said my prints came up on 40 kilo's of cocaine
Karen haircut.
That scammer sounds like Indian scammer
That accent 😂🤨
First
Gyat
