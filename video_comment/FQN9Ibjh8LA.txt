Painting it as ‘far right’ is sickeningly dishonest.
It’s time to fight for our countries and take the West back.
The real "far right" is the controlled and manipulative media lying to their own people....
Since when has it been "far right" to react against a barbaric hostile alien invasion?
Irish for Irish
😥😥😥😥
I don’t think they heard that try that in a small town record 😂
This is what I picture when ever I hear talk about wyt on wyt crime
The British always maintained that the Irish were uncivilised, and having travelled to many European cities, I think the British are correct.
Far right😂😂 Fake news at its best, Boycott these government puppets
Leftwing propaganda
If protecting your family and homeland against foreign attack is considered "far right", then I guess I'm a fascist now.
Well done to the Irish for standing up to these dictators, take back your country.
The far left are destroying Ireland
NOT FAR RIGHT JUST RIGHT
So how is it far right then 😂
What a rediculous, biased and ignorant headline. Typical. Continue to label people, refuse to engage and this will be the result.
Ireland being Ireland!
Multiculturalism on mass does not work.
MAKING US THE STORY At no point is it explained why first world countries need to be flooded with third world economic migrants that pretend to be "refugees."
If caring about your family and your race is far right. Im far right.
Well if the Far-Left wasn't allowing this to happen the Far-Right wouldn't be defending the honor of  a 5 year old!! It's odd that so many countries are having this migrant problem!?  It like a group of people met in secret and planned the whole thing !! I wonder who!?
We Londoners will never stoop to the scandalous behaviour of Dubliners. We British didn't get where we are today by destroying shops.
Far right?? Come on, they're regular citizens that have had enough. This labeling has to stop, the media is a cancer.
There is no "far right" ...only people who are right so far
Fake news.
Listen/read the rhetoric from these lying obfuscating KHUNTS re far right...what a lovely useless pigeon hole...!!!!khunts
Far Right? What nonsense. Just Right Irish Patriots.
"Far-right" Gaslighting
Looks like Antifa... smells like Antifa... must be the far right!
...seriously hurt after islamic migrant violence
Anything to the right of Karl himself is now considered "far right".
"Far right" 😂
The far left did much worse after a know criminal was murdered but when multiple incidents of murder happens its right wing
I am kinda thinking these roiters are possible antifa. It makes no sense to be angry at an evil government, and taking it out on shop owners and lowly police.  When has anything ever been gained from taking your anger out on the wrong people?
Come out ye black and tans!
year after years when people protest for this problem that change there countrys from the inside ....media always label them as political groups....maybe world have revanche for the colonialism for 500 years ...but i dont think Ireland is to blame to that...hope Irish can protect them selfs and there culture.And just for example Russia and China never have that kind of problems....wonder why...
Stop calling it far-right. liars
Nothing about the little 5 year old girl???
Get them immigrants. Teach them a lesson. They should be grateful they have been accepted into the country
https://youtu.be/1b4Uzpc2Gxw
Youve made far right look likw the good guys again
Far Right is a term used by media and politicians to deflect the blame of their crimes onto the people. Shops, vehicles and goods can be replaced but the lives snuffed out or damaged cannot be replaced or repaired as easily.
Stabbings are a regular occurance in Israel….also shootings, car rammings etc…Welcome to the club
More terrible reporting from the MSM
Calling all Irish diaspora we are under tyranny please help us
Calling this riot "far-right" is just like what the Soviet Union called the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, right after killing thousands of civilians that wanted democracy in an authoritarian communist dictatorship.
far right lmao stop just stop
These are probably not far right guys...  Support from germany
Leftists seething. They'll upset their pet Algerian.
The real Irish are rising up nothing to do with the far right just patriots
Far right 😂
Was it an Algerian Muslim??
Lmao your bullshit "far right" narrative doesn't work anymore, people are not blind.
According to media:  - Immigrant stabbing = mentally unbalanced person  - People demonstrating against violence and crimes in their country = far right people   😂😂
Brixton, poll tax, toxteth
But when blacks do it its just a protest.
Muslims  should leave
I can’t sympathize with the cause if these are the people that think the U.S should have open borders. By the way, the U.S. was not yet a civilization when the settlers arrived, the Natives definitely weren’t perfect themselves, they were actually allowed to fight back against the settlers, and the settlers gave them the guns that the Natives fought them with. The illegals from Mexico today that refuse to adapt and take advantage of the Hispanic presence, the language barrier, and the system aren’t giving us guns to fight them back with are they?
Media do love labelling everyone as far right…. Maybe Irish people reacted to a situation that was horrifying !
There is NO far right here in Ireland.  There is HUGE anger about government dismissal of the public's concern about the massive numbers of people coming here in the last 3-5 years.  Enough.
Far right for being angry over a killing 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Telegraph should be visited by protesters
How is it far right 😂
Far right, yet it’s knives. 🤣 stfu goddamn commies.
Irish people have the right to defend themselves like anyone else.
This is another Brexit issue with illegal immigration.
FAR LEFT staged attach on humanity
I love how the media clowns are literally taking a paycheck and then helping bring about the genocide that is going to take place. As if themselves and their families will somehow be spared
Typical lefty media.
“far right” give us a break!
The news calling them far right is hate speech. Looks like a mostly peaceful protest anyhow
Oppressor’s riot attacking the poor oppressed immigrants, 😢so sad
Extreme deaf media
THE TELEGRAPH = FAKE NEWS / propaganda.  BOYCOTT!
Far right stuff getting old.....
These people are not far right! THEY ARE PATRIOTTS who want to save their country before it's too late.
How come  it's always   right when it's against  the government
For Far Right read Patriots.
Nobody in Ireland, outside of latte-drinking media shills, is worried about far right politics when they lay down to sleep.
Admire the Irish. Not cowards ❤
The people rioting aren’t being shot at, starved out, pushed down or caged in by anyone. They’re not acting as a last resort to not having their grievances heard because they don’t engage civilly for change in the first place. They sit idly by and grumble after reading the tabloids but don’t do anything with others to get anything done. They don’t know who did the knifing where , at this time NO FATALITIES HAVE OCCURRED. but they’re sure ready  to set cars on fire and act like animals with no information to go on. And when they don’t know anything they blame someone else for ‘holding out’ on what they think they’re entitled to know.  Then they do this.  And that takes us one step closer to armed guards. Nice work idiots. Just stop.
We refuse to lie here in dishonor! We are not criminals, but Irishmen! This is the crime of which we stand accused.  Bobby Sands☘️
TRACK ALL NAMES OF ALL LEFTIST reporters who try to blame so-called "far right" for this. These disgusting leftists are doing it and will have to be tried and convicted and jailed for hate crimes.  ENOUGH!
If these are far right I chose not to be far wrong 👍
Looks like a peaceful protest labeled violent by the media again...
These are not Far Right ffs.
The violence is from the Savage, heathen, demon 😈 muslims!! I 🇺🇲 stand with 🇬🇧 and my Christian brothers ✝️.  Jesus Christ is King of all!
We live with these kind of scavengers 24/7 and suffer on daily basis. Irish people these is your time to rise up!   Israel support Ireland 🇮🇪🇮🇱
Far right? Bullshit. Anyone with common sense and not a screaming leftist has a huge problem with the state of things. Dont lavel them far right
Far right? Aye sure the telegraph is a joke always was
"ultra mega master far right did something bad" media
"seriously hurt "? *3 people died...
So these idiots riot about immigrants yet it was an immigrant from Brazil that helped. Dumbest idiots ever. They just wanted to use this excuse as a way to a barbaric fight, dishonor authorities, destroy , loot and steal.
Far right?? 😂😂😂😂
Get these Muslims back to their own countries. They have created a culture of hate because they don’t respect our culture nor our religion.
Spreading misinformation again.. this is not far right.
The woke fools in in charge still don't get that the growing support for the far-right is directly born out of these woke irresponsible policies.
It seems to be that anything left of centre, is now considered far right.
Two wrongs dont make a right
The media cause most of the violence by being "free" to report lies.
That's not far right lol. The looting was bad but the unrest is what most of the country is feeling.
Stop this uncontrolled immigration, good for Ireland!!! The western world is finally waking up
They still haven't released the attackers identity
Still protecting the attackers identity though... I wonder why
Salvajes
"Far right" What trash journalism.
We all know by now that when a white dude does it, it's a terror attack.  When their skin is a darker hue though, skin colour suddenly becomes irrelevant and the word terrorist vanishes into the ether ...
Those are "mostly peaceful protests" by American standards.
" far right" is leftis propaganda
Mostly peaceful
How is the little girl and the other attacked victims doing?
Far right? it's comments like that, that cause this mess.
The  identity or photo of the person is not revealed so its certainly not terrorism but a lone wolf attack we where warned of 🤫
Bullshit propaganda
When foreigners do it in France because of a Frenchman, it's a justfiied protest. When Irish do it in their own country because of a migrant, it's "the far right". What a joke.
these news titles are despicable
Not far right  it’s the Irish people they are done with the invasion of their country.
Isn't the same media justifying Paris riots just few weeks ago and call it "protesting"? The shameless bias of mainstream media must be stopped.
These fkn migrants
I love how the government wont go after the real criminals, but want to protect the stabber.  Far right?  what a joke
As a Swiss guy, i Congratulate the Irish people ! We must defend our Christian Europe against the imminent danger of Islam !!
🇹🇷👉 DANGER !! MOSSAD GAMES .
They did the homework, they contemplated there future actions and decided today they would be far-right lololloloololoollollol  only a left wing middle class journalist would say this!
lol Far-Right what does that even mean? Not one of these people obviously follows politics! lol
Free the justice demonstrators
Notice that almost every mainstream media outlet is reporting this story using the same headline, in lockstep. These outlets are so obviously propaganda machines churning out misleading headlines and stories in order to serve an agenda, rather than reporting the truth. Anybody who cannot see this reality must have intentionally blindfolded themselves!
Far-right is a synonym for good now, Zelegraph. STAY STRONG PATRIOTS OF ÉIRE
Extreme left wing media can't help themselves.
Irish birth rate declined by 20% in the last decade, CSO figures show. I guess the Algerian was just showing them a taste of what's to come.
Well done to the Irish for finally doing something that expresses their feelings regarding foreignors being prioritised over ALL else and the disgusting and depraved behaviours they bring with them. Such a shame that the politicians and mainstream media are so utterly corrupt and bigoted that they blame the people who are the ones suffering for objecting to the ideology that has led to this state of affairs.
Love to see where your evidence of far right. These look like concerned patriots
Ireland for Victory
It's not the far right. It's people sick of hearing that yet another "asylum" seeking terrorist has attacked locals. They are not welcome.
Im Irish. There is no far right in Ireland. (Except a very small trickle of a minority). So this crap that the protesters are “Far Right” is complete nonsense. If anything, their political leanings would be towards the left.  If anything, the people in Ireland who want change are left leaning. All the alternative political parties in Ireland who want change and who these protestors would vote for as an alternative as all left leaning.  What really fueled the complete anger in Dublin were the bare faced lies told by the Mainstream Media, Politicians and Gardai (Police) etc that this was some random nutter with a knife.  It was not a random nutter. It was a long planned Terrorist attack by an Islamic Extremist. The Mainstream Media, Politicians and Gardai (Police) need to stop lying to us and tell us the truth about what really happened in Dublin.  There were many witness to the knife attack. People clearly saw what really happened.  And this same guy, an Islamic extremist, approx 5 months ago, was in court on knife carrying charges.
I wonder who owns the Telegraph?
Someone's pissed off that the Irish support Palestine....
What's the motivation of "the far right"?
White Irish are rising up
Stop Islamic invasion, Ireland for irish
Far right my arse
What kind of human garbage came up with this politicized video title?
How can those people be patriots burning the streets and lotting ?!! Seems to be something wrong is going on there. Hope things get better soon
riots are the voice of the unheard. ;)
Far right . What BS .
Not Far-Right, they are patriots!
I’ve been to Dublin twice , I love Dublin and people are the most friendliest . So sad it’s come to this  Hope it gets solved 🙏🏼
Islam is the problem
I hope will never work.....
Leave it to British news to label irish protecting themselves from Algerian extremists violently assaulting ethnic irish as “far right”.  Telegraph is trash
Quite strange how the MSM never use the term far-left or extreme-left but are happy to label people as far-right??????
I'm starting to wonder if the 1930s Germany was actually 'far right'   Seems that label is put on people wanting to protect their home .... 🤔
In the 1920's Ireland gained independence from the English. Now they face a more serious and toxic threat, not least from their enemy within.
Islam…
I can figure out how Nazism was made normal. Look at the comments. Social Media must take more responsibility
'The rioters rioted riotously....'.The media has discovered a word they didn't have in their vocabulary in the 3 years since the understandable demise of George Floyd. Every search I have done to find stories about the stabbings has only resulted in recounts of what previously since May 2020 would would have been described as 'mostly peaceful social gatherings of like minded individuals with legitimate concerns and a fondness for Nike running shoes'
I don't think that these people are right-wing radicals, rather they are people who have understood that something is wrong in the system in which they live (Matrix). Or to put it another way, it is the government, with which they are unsatisfied, and the even better informed among them, suspect or know that such "Knife Attacks" are not coincidences, but got planned by the "Powerful?" The people themselves have realized that they can no longer be fooled by a few self-proclaimed "Elite-Idiots" that´s it!!!🤑
Thugs. The hoodie and track ends brigade. They should be brought under control ASAP.
"far right" 😂😂
Angry public is far right now? It’s gov and media fault
"Far Right" Yeah okay MSM......
Name the attacker, stop gaslighting calling out the "Far Right" the Irish born citizens are seriosly pissed off
Religion of peace ✌️
It's nuts to see the amount of brain rot that  spreads on the Right wing.
Change headline
PEOPLE HAVE HAD ENOUGH MIGRATION
Far Right riots ? Like all the people who are rioting belongs to the same political party ? Those are common people and these so called liberal agencies call themselves intellectual 😑
Its insane that the Media is still saying the claims are unsubstantiated about the guy being an Algerian migrant living in government housing.  That information is 100% correct as well as the fact he was arrested within the last year for possession of a knife and literally nothing was done.   Then ask yourself why does your government want these migrants so bad?  Out of the kindness of their heart or for leverage against its citizens 🤔
not far-right, just ordinary people's anger i guess
But Ireland supports Palestine 😂😂😂
Far right my arse. 🫡🇬🇧
pi$$lamia ,sahids,FALSEtine hamasvirus23,hezEBOLA,problems coming in all to Europe
Self-defence of your community is now right wing
Tow weeks ago Irish people were shouting from the river to the sea without knowing what is this river. Hi from Israel. From the river to the sea Ireland will be free
It's the first time in history Europe is in a war without fighting back.
Telegraph is so full of sh1t haa? Indonesian supports Irish People.
Ah yes, the « far right » scapegoat.
Its all over.
Nothing far right about this!
Kellett ez nektek, Nyugat Európa. Már a gyerkeiteket ölik. És ha megszólalsz beverik a pofád. Köszönjétek meg az álszent rohadék politikusaitoknak.
The media were cheerleading the Floyd riots, but call these rioters thugs and far right extremists? The media are a virus.
Uk immigration policies hitting Ireland pretty hard like the Irish potato famine.
THIS IS NOT FAR RIGHT, THIS IS THE VOICE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE...
Unfortunately I see this occurring all over the West as governments have deliberately ignored the democratic wishes of the people with mass immigration.
Really sad to see all the violence in Dublin, hope the police can get it under control
The man who subdue the attacker, was immigrant. The marauder where white young irish.
I’m loving the comment to like ratio here. Makes me hopeful
Ahh media propaganda at its best
Algerian again
Happy to see that Irish people react to what happened. They only want to live in their country without being afraid of getting killed by illegal migrants. Let’s face it. This forced multiculturalism has failed.
🐷☪️🐷☪️🐷☪️🐷☪️🐷
Congratulations on the freebies
THE MEDIA ARE BREEDING MORE FAR RIGHT PEOPLE. FANTASTIC THEYRE DOING THE BIDDING FOR US
Las ratas y las cucarachas en casa, son echadas o matadas por qué te destrozan tú tierra y eso no se puede permitir nunca
Esa sangre vikinga, arriba Dublín Que la gente no se entera. De la sangre qué corre por vuestras venas.
When Muslims or liberals do things like this its riot.. when others do it it's far right 😂..
The people of Ireland have had enough of this rubbish as they should be
Of course they never name "far left" violence when it happens.
I am writing that after the next 20 years, 90% of Europe will be filled with people from the world's most peace loving religion, ☪uslims.
WAKE UP . PEOPLE OF IRELAND.
Hilarious how broken the west is, gets mad at the violence so they start riots and burning down cities with violence...😂😂😂
WE WERE NEVER ASKED
As always, the media, police and politicians can't wait to blame the "far-right" for anything they don't like when it's merely the ordinary citizens of a country who've had enough of globalism, multiculturalism and third world savages committing violence against their people.
FAR RIGHT VIOLENCE? PLEASE.... 😁😂🤣😅🤣
Lier that not far right
Nothing to do with "far right " !!! It's only survival.!
MSM are truly the ENEMY of the people....
Become ungovernable.
Based protect Europe
America is the world’s toilet
Poland has it tight.  No illegal immigrants
Far right? A little girl was stabbed by a inmigrant monster.
I’m in the USA 🇺🇸 and we are all under attack the globalists organizing all this and  the media to lie to all of us is our common real problem and these George Soros types must be stopped permanently!! These Globalists are the real hard targets!! They have set up this huge network of mis-information against the Jews and also the Christians!! Be vigilant my Irish cousins!!! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
These aren’t far right people. These are people who are fed up with the UN and EU policy of pushing different cultures into their country and upsetting the balance. These are people who understand that not every culture is the same or equal. They’ve had enough and they want their country back.
Sorry far right groups don’t do this so this is a lie!! But Godless anti-christs most certainly do this!!! People that embrace many levels of evil as outlined in the Holy Bible are the types  they are called liberals or progressives!!
The telegraph is fake news!
The Pro-terrorist Telegraph.
This isn’t far right are people tired of immigrants from Muslim countries that are criminals raping and killing European citizens and governments do nothing enough is enough paying taxes and paying a government that hate us
Far right!? F/O. WEF BS
Far right ? Just people protecting their nation ?
Is the Far Right a political party? I would like to vote for their next candidate.
Show your bias more in the title..?
Islam a religion of peace 😂
Ireland needs a brand new uncorrupt government!
the only thing they accomplish by saying everything is far right, is pushing more centric people to the right.
These are no emigrants stubbing civilians - these are freedom fighters! They were oppressed in Europe! Poor "palestinians"!
Funny... Why is it far right? It's Irishmen that have had enough... But why is it far right?
"Far Right"? Oh yeah, the opposition voice to the "Far Left"
NOW IT'S AMERICA'S TIME TO WAKE UP!
Deport 💪😁
🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥😪
La rébellion des IRLANDAIS est remarquable !  Il reste encore des peuples fiers en Europe.  Vive l’Irlande.
Why is it for right violence? Maybe the people are just fed up!!!!!
Go Ireland 💪
Sounds like a terrorist attack to me.
FAR RIGHT THUGS???? The media are the real enemy.These are Irish people who have had enough of mass immigration
turks and other islamists out of europe
but when BLM burns a city down it's a "mostly peaceful protest"
"Far right" like that has any fking meaning anymore 😂
Poor headline - especially from The Telegraph. Even The Guardian managed not to use the term 'far-right'.
Misinformation 😂, go straight to h e double hockey sticks
Wow... Europe is awakening ❤
remember lads and lasses the media is to blame for a lot of this,dont let them off hold them responsible, "protest" at their places of work and homes to see how they like it
Írország  és Európa ébredj,  nincs szükség idegen kultúrájú migransokra. Ireland and Európa wake up!  No migration !get aut from Európa.
These are just peaceful protesters standing against oppression.  Those journos are clearly inciting hate.
not far right just  normal people fed up with the system and having their country stole from beneath their feet. Stand strong irish brothers respect from Ulster
What did the Irish immigrants to New York deserve?  Fortunately none of them were ever low life criminals, right?
The Irish marched for Palestine and got stabbed in the back..the masks are falling
It was a stinking immigrant that carried out the knife attacks
The leftie leaflet that is "The Guardian" never fails to dissapoint with it biased crap!
I am against mass immigration of black and brown men from sh*thole countries... So I guess I'm 'far-right'.
In LA right now, the police have no control of the city…they are letting Chinese militants run around doing drills
Citizens will protect their land and people, its not far right its called doing the right thing, this is our country and our people, we will protect it and not pander to criminals or vicious people who want nothing to do with us, our laws or our culture!!
The Telegraph is a disgrace.
The media gripes about the symptom rather than the cause. Is it August 2020/October 2023 already?
Disgusting. As the descendant of Irish refugees who were among the million+ who fled that country in the mid-1800s and found homes around the globe, and as the friend of Irish people who recently emigrated to live in Canada, I’m appalled by this Irish bigotry.  I’d bet my bottom dollar that everyone in that crowd of goons would think themselves perfectly entitled to move to any other country they wanted to live in.
This is a sign that Jesus is coming soon
🍀 💪
When will people finally wake up? Finally do something about this madness?! The Irish have the right idea. Stand up for your country!
Then I must be Far right....
Far right? No people concerned about the 1 million immigrants who have entered Ireland.This is just the start in Europe.Its time to drive the Invaders out of Europe,and the big business who  brought them here but not  to live next door to them.
Proudly far right. I remembered when the "FAR LEFT" burned down Kenosha and Minneapolis. Never forger!
Normal people are far right for corrupted politics and leftish scam.
If being against immigration is far right, China mustn't be as leftist as we thought.
THIS IS NOT FAR RIGHT.
why is there a new strategy of labelling everything controversial as far right?
How are people justifying this? Maybe take a day to think about it more logically
Stop extrem islam in Europe
Far right ! Unbelievable false reporting. It's the Irish people sick of having 3rd world parasites forced on them and their families.
This is not far
Telegraph = Fake news.
Gaza ver 2.023
Ahhhh, good old fashioned Democracy. The people are speaking, is the government hearing them? There will be much more of this .... far left extremist government policies caused this.
Patriots fight for their home & freedom from ter*rism
Telegraph is a joke. What a terrible false headline.
The madia as always by side of DEVIL
this is not far right & not violence stop lies,  people want protection & safety in their home land . SHAME ON MADIA
I don't see the problem. Only balls
This is not a far-right riot. These are people fed up with immigrants invading their land and are tired of it.
#WhyNoVoteForImmigration
Guns not allowed in Ireland ?
People can’t VOTE themselves out of what the POWERS THAT BE have wished on them. There aren’t many options left. It’s not FAR RIGHT to protect your kin, but it IS right and proper!
Typical calling them far right. This is a result of mass immigration. By cowards in control
"Far right" is an antiWhite slur!
They are NOT far right! They are DAMN right!
Every country in the world in history fought of invaders not put them in 4 star hotels with spending money
Them not revealing the identity told those people everything they needed to know. And people rarely go around killing their own in those numbs, especially not in that manner.
Too many migrants in Europe
The DT is currently in the process of a buy out by middle eastern private investors which might explain the Lefty tag,
This is what happens when the country's leaders let people down. If in a Muslim country a Christian did that attack, the lives of all Christians there would be in danger.
asylum seekers = male illegal immigrants from Middle East and North Africa
MUH FAR RIGHT LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL if these are Far Right, the knifer must have been Far Left
Well now, puts a different perspective on “ Come out ye Black an tans now don’t it? “
This aint 'far right', people want this country cleaned of immigrants! It's plain simple!
When I see the term far right I just assume it's coming from the far left.
Laughable gaslighting. 20 year irish citizen, why 20 year? Oh right, because he’s only lived there less than half his life and IS a foreigner. Europe is waking up
Disgusting newspaper
I’m a 17 year old femboy furry, and even my views are considered “further right than conservative” these days, despite my views being a combination of that of the classic working class British, democratically defined majority. People who call us “far right” are probably people who were born into a nurtured life and lack much ability for logic and critical thoughts, people who have never had to actually work for a living.   Not flexing, but I was blessed to be born both into a middle class family and with critical thinking skills that most neurologically plastic and corrigible people of my generation don’t have these days. Logic.
Il "MAIN STREAM" enfatizza più i disordini dei fascisti irlandesi (😂😂😂) infatti tutti sanno che Mussolini era di origini britanniche, piuttosto questo atto brutale. In italia si parla di un naturalizzato irlandese piuttosto che di un nord africano. Magari è fascista anche lui... chissà? Il futuro disegnato dai padroni a Bruxelles? Società di schiavi meticci senza dio e tradizioni. Per loro ci sarà sempre la svizzera e il lussemburgo. Cordoglio per le vittime. 🇮🇹🇮🇪
Israel made these events happen. For manipulation. Because of support for Palestine.  ￼
These Are Concerned Citizens! And Now Your Response is Far Right! Over Recent Refugee Stabbings!
“Far Right”, my arse.
anything the mainstream media disagrees with is far right
🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
TOO BAD SOME HUMANS HAVE TO LIE, AND MAKE UP REASONINGS, IN ORDER TO GET VIEWS. IT WASN'T FAR RIGHT, IT'S THE WHOLE COUNTRY TRYING TO PROTECT THEMSELVES.
Hello from poland 🇵🇱 🖐🖐🖐 no migrants in poland and very good for us!!!!....western government chosen wrong path
"Far right" - 😂Telegraph please...
Why are they far right.
Looks like the peaceful BLM protests
Ganz Europa sollte sich ein Beispiel an Irland nehmen, gut gemacht Patroiten!💪🏼🇮🇪👊🏻
It's time to stand up to these invaders of our ancestral homelands. STAND UP ⚔️🕊️
when communists riot to make the human race slaves the media applauds. When real man stand up for their country against foreign invaders the media shames and condemns. The media is the enemy. the media is your enemy. the media is the enemy of all people.
Far Left Politics brought us here. The Politicians of Ireland should be ashamed of themselves...
Hold the police and politicians accountable for this mess for not doing their jobs right
Who did the knife attacks? Were they Hamas?
far right my a^^
I'd rather be far right then far WRONG.
Not wanting preschoolers to get stabbed is Far Right now, apparently. The dislike ratio speaks for itself
Terrorists are funded by leftist governments and media.
Looks mostly peaceful to me.
Correct! There should be a show of sympathy for the Irish in every capital of Europe. And in the future, all acts and propaganda supporting or facilitating Muslim migration must be classified as anti-European acts.
‘fAR riGHt viOLENcE’ 🥴🤦🏽‍♂️🤡
It shocks me to read the comments saying that "diversity is the weakness, not the strength". Are these people really Christians? But realize one thing:  An immigrant (brazilian man) who took a risk to save the people. The problem is not immigrants, but PEOPLE. There are BAD AND GOOD people in ANY COUNTRY. IN ANY RELIGION.
"far-right"  🤣
What these thugs really wanted was a night to loot and pillage. Morons didn't know that the Dublin suspect was taken down by Brazilian immigrant Caio Benicio. When the 43-year-old Brazilian food delivery driver saw the attack happening he jumped off his motorcycle, took off his helmet, and hit the attacker with it until he collapsed.
"FAR RIGHT" ?? FECK OFF WITH UR FAR RIGHT LABEL !! THEY'RE PATRIOTS
Never trust the media!!
I'm far right then and so is everybody else who doesn't approve of what the liberal left extremist ate doing to europe
Thankyou ireland for standing up for your own good on ya 💯
People make a stand and the media label them far-right.  We all know who the real terrorists are.
Far righter here ✔️
Europe is disintegrating, it's on the path to white right wing extremism. God help us all.
ISLAM AGAIN?
Biased somewhat?
Far right thugs? How about deeply concerned Irish People.
If FAR RIGHT. Is being angry about this then so be it I’m far right
It's just a fiery but mostly peaceful protesting.
Yeah, but these protestors taxes are being used to fund the illegal immigrants hotel accommodation.
“Far right” They mean normal
Quite funny what's happening in Ireland  On one hand it is by far the most antisemitic and pro-Hamas country in Europe On the other hand, they are burning cars and calling for deportation of the same Jihadists they love so much
By wanting to protest immigration, the people are burning the cars of their good fellow citizens, and they're going to end up in prisons, so it's dumb and stupid, instead of protesting intelligently.
Irish finally realize that being with the eu is a disaster. the uk will welcome ireland back with open arms
But when BLM burn down towns there’s no stereotypes there then? I don’t support this mindlessness, yet I’m one of those purported “Far Right” but to best of my knowledge I’m not an “uneducated knuckle dragging moron’” my grammar becomes lacklustre when peeved!  Agent’ provocateurs. Perhaps? . I said “Perhaps” it’s hardly an unknown phenomenon though. Finally, these people destroying property, and generally terrorising neighbourhoods, should be tried to full extent of the law. The epitome of “ Not in my name”
Don't be such a tosser far right they are the indigenous people of Ireland 🇮🇪 they want there country back, given away by the government
FAR RIGHT MY ARSE....
Fake news with a fake headline. Screw The Telegraph 💩
It's not far right, it's Martin and the rainbow
😦Titles of Satan/Lucifer:     Angel of light, morning star, no spirit means souless, the fallen one/ comes down each night, greatest deceiver of all. Satans angel name is Halal/Heilel, (hebrew translation 666), one eye, 😦     And to know it's written in Quran that Allah carries the same titles.🤔
If i punch the Telegraph journalist they will call me far right or far left? And will it make any diferrence? Just asking.
After observing the riot and the comments, all immiigrants must be paid lifetime social security for mass hostility, hatred and breaking of anti-discrimination, anti-racism law.
What a peaceful, civilized bunch
Call the Irish Diaspora to Arms with a Right of Return for those willing to defend.  Tons of Irish American Veterans are sick of the USA I can say for sure!!
If the system fails to protect its people from terrorists , then the people responds …. How can u call u call it far right violence ….
😂😂😂 and they criticize israel for retaliate to Hamas. If Ireland would have suffered only 1% of the terror attacks that israel is suffering, Irish people should have burned all Europe. Keep condemning israel, we will send all Hamas terrorist to irland
Shame on anyone focusing their minds mainly on the rioting and not the poor unfortunate victims of the knife attack. Angry citizens driven to the brink with legitimate concerns get labelled 'far right'. Stop lying @Telegraph or prove your unfounded allegations.
What about "I fell sorry for both sides". Maybe Ireland should stopp oppressing muslims, and solution is two states!
not far right just ordinary people who have had enough
far right arent as insulting as it was
Fake news
Far right 😂 what a load of bollocks.
Nah its " all white not far right". ALL
Why is the FAKE news agencies calling it Far Right? The locals have had enough  of these open borders. Look at the US mess
The telegraph is an enemy of the people.
This just in: Extremist far right news journals around the western world hide facts in order to propagate the destruction of western civilization, as seen in the above video.
The guy who stopped the stabber was Brazilian😂
The police are the problem along with the politicians!!!
why no info on attacker?  (we know why)
far right???????  far right?????????????
Oh look once again they are labelled far right. Makes me disgusted to see the leftie media hating on the real people of the world.
MSM won't even update on how the poor little victims and their mums are!
Yet again the mainstream media calling indigenous people far right because they are sick to the back teeth of this so called diversity in our countries,  that we didn't give our consent to,  want or need, this is what happens when people reach breaking point because spineless politicians wont listen to the people!!!
Ireland for the Irish
Note how the entirety of the mainstream media have flown into action to label the protests as 'far right' or 'extreme right wing' etc etc. They are all at it. Just like the Garda who initially tried to deceive the public by statig that the perpetrator was 'an Irish citizen'. Once the lie was exposed they then added 'of 20 years' to the statement. The way they have acted immediately, as if under the control of one directive, suggests that the elitist's globalisation project has to be defended at all costs and even if innocents are slaughtered along the way, it is simply collateral damage. Now it is out that the attacker is Algerian, they will move onto another well rehearsed lie, that he is 'suffering from mental health issues' etc etc.
True Americans stand with the Irish people.  Immigration ruining our country and cultures.  These people have zero intention of living in peace among us.  Take our countries back
Think about the 1400 Israelis that were slaughtered.....
Far left gone krazy more like it
This isn't "far-right". Looks mostly peaceful.
Shame, shame, shame all of this rioting without being drunk, shame, shame, shame 😡🤬🤯
The 'Far-right' were at home on Twitter spaces, it was the local young fellas that erupted in anger.
It's going to be hilarious when the suspect turns out to be 🇺🇲.
Far right my arse
The Telegraph , the BBC ,  controlled radical leftist propaganda.  They need to be held accoutable
Far right? We should all stop watching these news channels and stations.
They have 44 Countries , Most of them are Gigantic. DEPORT ALL MUSLIM IMMIGRANTS!!!!!!!!! This isn't "ISLAMOPHOBIA". It is what it is.
It was a fiery but mostly peaceful protest.
Far right 🤔
Many western governments are trying to "dilute" countries with immigrants for the purpose of stripping their national identity. Once completed it makes for an easier transition for a "global government" to control the masses.
America, Germany, France, England , Canada,  Ireland and Australia have all been flooded with third world illegal alien muslims and others
The looting is unacceptable and disgusting behaviour but the Irish people are angry with their governments lack of keeping them safe from terror attacks from the uninvited illegally entered immigrants. Power to the people of Ireland standing up against the weak Irish government
Far right is a slur, any decent news site would not use it,
corrupt media calls them asylum seekers,  more lies, they've flooded every western nation will illegal alien muslims and other third world criminals
For gods sake, fix the immigration policies
This so called news media is an enemy of the state and should be treated as such treason!!!
Send those terrorists back to their countries ... If the Europeans and whole world didn't take an action against terrorism and the Islamic invasion under the name of refugees or emigration Europe and the world will suffer a hell .
F. All to do with far right I hope the Irish take there country back now
Now support free palestine 😂
Here we go again with the 'far-right'.
Because they stand with Palestine, they will not leave them alone
Every country who doesn't agree with Israel's policy gets Riots and Manifestations ... coincidence ?
#NeverAgain
So kann man auch die weltweiten demostratnen gegen isrel eindemmen, indem man diese länder bestraft. Wie, man nimmt sich wie immer irgendwelche heuchler, zweigesuchtige verkaufte leute, sagt denen mach das und dies. Lässt ein verbrechen ausüben und tut am schluss die schuld wieder einer gruppe zuschreiben und beschuldigen, um diesen angst zu machen, damit duese mit ihren protesten im land gegen die aoartheit isrel aufhören und nicht vom völkemod sorechen. Irlands monister hatten offt die  taten isrel kritisiert, nicht so wie in deutachland z.b. nun wird von den geheimmächten englands das ganze land dafür bestraft. Und die sübdenblcke sind wiedermal natürlich die muslme. Das ist taktik dieser möchte, um eine bestimmte bewegung due für miteinander, frieden, gerechtigkeit, ehrluchkeit ist zum schweigen zu bringen. 😂😂
Glad people are waking up to the narratives and lies of the media. 👍
Neonazies
misinformation at its finest
It's not far right it's common sense
The far left have caused this. When will the West realise multiculturalism has failed
Far right haha   dont flood countries with unscreened illegal immigrants and things like wont happen
Far right my ars. People have had enough of unwanted foreigners invading our country and then murdering us in our own land. In this case an Algerian muslim.
Defending yourself and your country from foreign terrorist, is now far right? Jesus!
Immigrants need to watch themselves HARD in foreign places. Act like a good guest, or find out next
Far rights?? people are angry beacuse a 5 year old was attacked with a knife seriously the people who write these articles seriously need to be held accountable but no one believes main stream media news now anyways so the anger will just continue to risr
Far right what a joke people have had enough this is a result of a corrupt government who refuse to listen to the people who elected them.
if the police identified the attacker, these would not happen so WHY did the police conceal the identity??  answer is obvious who the attacker is, and the reason to conceal is to prevent this EXACT THING from happening. 1+1 = 2
Far right, far left the media always pitts sides against each other. Black and white same old same old. Just stop your nonsense its so cliché now.
Protecting your community and Homeland is not "far right", it's common sense. Whoever came up with that headline deserves a gold star. Six points of course. 😐
How do they know that they're far right? There just antisocial hooligans looking for any excuse to riot.
eu membership forever hating national security
Good. Enough is enough. These animals need to be deported. Immediately!
How tf it is far right? People are angry at a horrible crime. Anyone with a Sane mind would be angry! CORRUPT MEDIA!!!
Seems like Ireland is being punished for speaking up alone against tyranny!
Calling this far right is a travesty. These are regular citizens sick to the back teeth of their country and culture being trashed and their security being  compromised by clowns on all sides of politics. They no longer have a voice and no represents their views. Expect more of the same hopefully in the UK also.
This is what we must do in America
I am so fed up with people of color
Fair play to the young dubs , they have been pushed to this .
Seems like Ireland too needs someone like Geert Wilders as Next PM of Ireland. This is what happens when some official in Brussels who is completely unaccountable to people of Ireland is allowed to make important decisions such as foreign policy, asylum and economy for them
FAR RIGHT , no just idiots   . stop the bias ffs
At some point, people will start wearing the label 'far right' as a badge of honor.. all the lefty shame tactics will fail as people grow tired and angry... what then ?
Apparently far right people only care about innocent being stabbed and killed.
So "Far Right" means wanting a safe community and vetting of immigrants?
Is the stabber identity mentioned. How do they know its a migrant???
Why is it "far-right" to not want your country overrun by immigrants and "asylum seekers" who will never ever make so much as an attempt to integrate into your society because your politicians are idiots and not wanting the police to lie to the public.    It's even going on in my previously peaceful little part of the world.  According to my local sheriff, there used to be one or two assault calls in a week, and a smattering of things like theft.  Then the federal government decided that we needed diversity.  Specifically refugees from Africa.  Now there are three or four assault calls a day and retail theft has caused businesses in the area to close.  These "refugees" have been here for years, get everything for free, don't learn the language, and none of them are even willing to work.  Yet, I'm far-right for thinking they need to be sent back.
Far right lol who told yea that the Irish government
Why the protestors trash their own people properties?
gfy telegraph
Civil war is possibility in any european country with open door policy..
When entire Ireland 🇮🇪 stands with Palestine 🇵🇸 and against apartheid regime and their partners in Genocidal crimes and Ireland is vocal for Humanity and Gaza... Hidden Hands of Zionists will trigger these protests. Lots of well wishes for Irish politicians and sensible Public to keep Irish  legacy.
The uniforned/media far right calling protesters far right. All by design.
Theres going to be hate speech laws and increased police presence now.
Secretary-General of the UN Antonio Guterres: "This attack didn't happen in a vaccum"
NOT "FAR RIGHT VIOLENCE"! This is a country who's people were betrayed by their Gov, allowed open borders to any and all. And allowed violent extremists into their country! Now the Media tries to ignore the heinous crimes committed by these people and the police LIE and say it wasn't a terror attack. IT WAS. How much more should the citizens take from these people who are extremists and came to THEIR country just to spit on their culture and way of life? NO DEPORT THEM BACK TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY! CLOSE THE BORDER AND STOP ALLOWING WHOEVER TO CROSS INTO YOUR COUNTRY! There has to be a process. Vetting.
Irish lives matter
Police are supposed to be Non political but seem to Tar this as Far right, supposed to protect the Irish people
Completey mostly peaceful loonatic
the blame lies solely with the left-liberals who brought Ireland to this situation.
Not far right at all .... Liesse
Your gaslighting games dont work anymore.
"Far right" Lol
Its far right to the politicians and them at the top because people dont agree with there agenda the people voted them in to do as the people want not what they want its that simple .
Their liberals but nice try WEF
The violent above are far right, then its easy to say that the knife man was far left
What a pathetic headline, that nobody is buying.
"Far Right" F U Leftygraph
TAKE THE WORDS FAR RIGHT OUT OF THE TITLE OF THIS VIDEO NOW!!!!!!!
anyone who makes a stand for common sense and rightly so are angry with what is being done to irelands way of life far right extremists? This was caused bar far left extremist ideology in the first place.
Its not far right, the guy who attacked was a failed asylum seeker..the protesters set ablaze a migrant hotel, the working classes have had enough!!! Put them in ur middle class areas..balance the books abit!!!!!!
#sendthemback
I would rather be far right then far wrong!
Multiculturalism is failing worldwide
Irish is weak. They support Palestine right? 😂
Das Lange Putsch is on the rise worldwide.  Trying to create the conditions among the citizens that existed in Germany in 1929:  financial insecurity, fear and hatred of 'strangers', division and estrangement within humanity.  DONT FALL FOR IT!
That weren´t riots but progroms. At least against property
Far right, what a dishonest media would say, these reporters and newspapers are half the problem
This is expected from the Far Right. They should get deported, not normal people who were just born outside Ireland.
Yeah i must be far right aswell
We get screw by migrants and our government give everything away for free to helping migrants out but not they own people who pay tax . We are flight back ..
Im not anti immigration, i just think the government has made a mess of it.  Rather the EU has made a big mistep and are being naive when it comes to immigration.
0:37 Yep, this is a mostly peaceful protest against colonization.
Far right? Or people tired of this crap. U sunt
I don't like it OR agree with it, but I understand it. This is what happens when a subset of the population believes their voice is not being cared about. Listening and caring are two entirely different things. Typically, the left will want inclusion at the expense of the nation. Typically, the right agrees inclusion is good but not at the expense of the nation or it's people. This act took place because of this divide and because the politicians are out of touch with one side over the other.... that never ends well. Ultimately, the people will become angry and this becomes the consequence of government pitting and baiting it's CITIZENS against one another.  Politicians are successful at getting people wound-up against each other and they won't stop until they lead the people by the nose like cattle to carry their water as if they're slaves and the crooks sit at the top whilst the hard working people are crouched on their hands and knees so that power-starved and corrupt politicians and corporations can dine off our bruised backs.  We must see! Look past pettiness, frustration, anger and hopelessness. Look up, look up! Looking down is in desperation whilst looking up is for inspiration. Stop fighting because it's what is wanted by power and control starved megalomaniacs!  We're all so much better than this. Just look at us... being fooled into a corner like that. Turn off the T.V., step back a second and ask yourself this... "If the world was in a catastrophe from which no survivors were found... would any of these arguments mean a damn thing?"
I'm far right than for wanting justice for the little girl that got stab.
Far left journalism is the cause of this
The Government is allowing an invasion so the Men are standing up. I support Ireland. Take your Country back!
The Telegraph should shut down based off that false headline calling it far right. Disgusting.
This.
Does anyone actually know the motive yet?
proud of irish patriots who are willing to stand up against left wing poltics and its gruesome consequences. about time...
"The riots were driven by far right lunatics!" - those distracting from the attacks that were created by far left policies.
The media is now censoring the truth and people are just angry. They are not far right. They are just standing up for their rights.
"Far Right"!    How low the press have falled, even those who we thought voiced our concerns.
Things are brewing in the rest of the British isles, it's a tinderbox waiting to explode 💣
Everything else to a Leftist is considered Far Right.
Hehe what goes around comes around😂 Free Palestine anyone??😂
The telegraph is a msm joke
As soon as I see the ‘far right’ designation I know I’m being played..Who funds the Telegraph I wonder?
Looks fiery but mostly peaceful to me.....
...and so the propaganda machine bursts into life while the flames still burn.  The "great unwashed" must remain brainwashed.
Far Right? No normal people sick of Far Left policies and biased reporting.
If Pakistan can Deport 40000 Afgani Refugees then so can Europe and the west ...save your country and deport them back to the Desert where they belong 💪
STOP with the "far right" BULLSHIT!!!!!!! People have the RIGHT to defend their families AND country!!!!!!!
It is time for Reconquista!
Unemployed hooligans... I thought the destruction of property was the cardinal sin on the right
So, its only the ''far-right'' that care when the innocent are stabbed, is it? I must be ''far-right'', then, along with the vast majority of people who care.
DISGUSTING to label and try dismiss them as a "lunatic fraction". Ha nice try. Taking propaganda out of America's playbook. People were stabbed and the person who did should be sent back to their own country, end of story. Ireland has enough of its own crime, homelessness, housing shortage etc. to deal with... NO MORE.
NOT FAR RIGHT
Migrant rioters mainly. Do they celebrate the stabbing of irish or using the opportunity to loot or both?😅
were standing for our country nothing else matters
Yes,multikulti is good
In the midst of "It's so over", I found there was, within me, an invincible "We're so back."
We stand with Ireland 🇺🇸. Protect your country from evil globalists who will stop at nothing to destroy your identity and culture
Supporting Palestine has backfired, from the sea to the sea Ireland 🇮🇪 will be Muslims free. support for Israel 🇮🇱
FAR RIGHT ?  Who put that title ? WHO.       Named this video. FAR RIGHT ?  Is this a joke.       We the people.  Have had it with this left and right  crap.  WE HAVE BEEN INVADED ..
White people are waking up to the multiculturalism lie. It won’t be long before they find out which ethnic group is tasked with destroying their countries.
Everyone right of Stalin and Mao is far right.
We're not far right, we're anti-immigration crime, we're for preserving our national identity and culture, we're not going to back down. We've had enough.
Not far right.  Ordinary citizens standing up for their families and community.
Anti Islam is not far right.
Un musulman qui poignarde des enfants au hasard dans la rue. La diversité qui profite des manifestations pour piller les commerces (j'ai une dizaine de VIDEOS qui le PROUVENT!), et ces médias qui imputent à l'ED l'attaque des enfants (lire l'article du lemonde) et les pillages. Dégoûtant.
So, what the Irish Parliament has been spouting as ‘inclusive’ shows that the public doesn’t have the same idea as the politicians! ENOUGH WITH THE ISLAM! Even Egypt and Jordan doesn’t want them, why should the rest of us? I admire Austria, Poland and Hungary! Don’t let a single one in! They bring their bad behaviour with them! Donald Trump is right! Shthole countries!
Misinformation😊😅😅😅
They'll label anything they don't like far right
Far right?😅😅😅😅
Far-Right me bollox. Cop on.
Far Right = Normal human
99% of these thugs are on social benefits all there life
Far too right vs far too wrong
Yeah blame the Far-right for a problem the dopey left caused clowns.
Where's MARY LOU ? she was so quick to denounce ISRAEL !
then 'free palestine' is also far-right.
What is name of attacker....
"Far-right", ha! Fark-off! TT are Idiots.
It's wrong to call everyone disagreeing with their governments immigration policy far right, racists 😮
Muslim algerian man stabbing children's
#Crépol
People are complaining about this going on, why did they behave like this ? I’ll tell ya, IT MADE THE NEWS didn’t it. NOW PEOPLE CAN WAKE UP TO WHATS REALLY HAPPENING THEIR COUNTRY. Rise up people WE ARE BEING INVADED !!!!!!!!
NATIONALISM OVER THE WORLD AGAINST NEW WORLD ORDER!!
Молодцы ирландцы !!!  Выгоняйте черную чуму долой !
When a Muslim commits a crime it’s called mental illness, when a white person commits a crime it’s called white supremacy.  The West is tired of being a minority in their own countries!
This is why the term "FAR RIGHT" has absolutely zero meaning nowadays. Good job yet again @The Telegraph. Lol.
Stop imigracji! Stop islam ! Stop fundamentalizm islamski!
The media are a liars and again doing the job of trying to put people down. This is no way a far right attack.
Good this is what people need to do.  The government cares less about psychopath immigrants stabbing people than IRISH people protecting their homeland.
Far right?
Politicians allowing mass immigration should be forcefully deported
Que Dieu bénisse McGregor. Que Dieu bénisse les Irlandais. Que les traîtres affrontent la colère du peuple et brûlent éternellement en enfer. Que tous les peuples occidentaux prennent exemple de la juste réaction irlandaise.
BLM was a protest.....this is a far right riot....👌🤣
Just think, if the assailant was a homegrown variety, these people would be sitting at home saying, "Oh, isn't it a pity!"
hmmm what a surprise hiding facts from the public because it will go against their liberal narrative
I'm Irish. There are too many morons in this world, on both the far right and far left. I want to express my disgust at the comments I've read here, but I wouldn't expect any better from consumers of the trash that most English newspapers dole out.
This is woke police, instead of defending irish people they are defeneding the criminal muslims.
Far right.. nice one di**head there just regular irish that have had enough
This is angry people...NOT far right ffs
Ireland's hatred of Jews, anti-Israel and sympathy with these terrorist groups welcomes their tactics into their catholic country. Honor killings are celebrated within muslim countries and Europe has been bringing the people who harbor these sorts of traditions/beliefs into their countries. The next generation Ireland will be an Islamic country
The suspect is a FAR RIGHT terrorist .  Those protesting are FAR RIGHT too The irony
The politicians and police should address the peoples concerns rather than call them names
Enough of this "far right" bullshit! Ordinary people have had enough of being swamped by mostly useless imports. If there was a census taken right now, there would be a significant majority that would say Enough!
Evil thugs destroying our town and our country , there are peaceful means of protest :
This isnt far right violence at apl. Id be furious too
It says everything that when these things happen, the media never explicity say what exactly happened.
So, the reason why BBC is not revealing attacker's identity is because he is immigrant Muslim, right?  Such moral fibre from our presstitutes...
Here is Europe,no Muslimahistan(muslim country).
the media in Europe are governed by the left. they shift the lens to the resulting protests. And they don't focus on the very serious act committed by this Algerian. We want to say that on average in Europe crimes are disproportionately committed by immigrants. the countries that welcome must be respected.
The right wing loves violence. Ewww.
nobody believes this bs 'far-right' narrative from media. Telegraph is fake news.
I'm definitely anti immigration. These are violent criminals bought here without vetting.
Not Far Right, just Right.
Who is that insane to stab a 5 year old?
This is not far right. The Telegraph it might be far left...
These were a massive load of Teenagers from outter Dublin it wasn't a faction or anything political.
Do people forget how the world was populated? The Irish , of which I’m one, have travelled and settled all over the world. Our nearest neighbours, England, put up signs outside boarding and lodging with reference to “No blacks, no Irish, no dogs”. Irish populations are lower than before the times of the great hunger, don’t be so short sighted and remember how your ancestors felt when they had no option but to leave Ireland. Remember what Bob Dylan once sang “I pity the poor immigrant”.
the person was an irish citizen of 20 years according to the bbc so not really irish then
Far right has nothing to do with it..That is just a term used to create propaganda
This is the shape of things to come allover Europe and the UK..because Our governments are not listening to the majority of the people . At least Poland and Denmarks leaders have the guts to do something about it.
It is the politicians and the lawmakers who totally ignore  the safety and well-being of their own citizens who are at fault.   Why are the media  keeping the identity of the attacker under wraps?
AP = FAKE NEWS
It's Better to MOVE OUT ALL 🇮🇪WHITE Europeans to some safe place in any island 🏝️ so IMMIGRANTS LIVE happily in IRELAND and Europe....
He was a migrant. We all know it.
The Telegraph really are the lowest of the low.
I’m voting far right then
The trashing of the muslim shops remind me of kristalnacht
The general population have had enough of immigration.The political parties just ignore their concerns so protests are bound to happen. Irish people have died it can be just swept under the carpet. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
How are the y far right telegraph better headline me thinks
Why are the police witholding the attackers true identity, is he Irish, WElsh, Scottish or English....or is he an immigrant ..... it is a disgrace...
All of this is the work of groups funded by the Zionists in there, who create riots and pin it on Arabs and Muslims to distort their image in purpose of changing Irish people’s sympathy with #gaza into hate!! I hope that the Irish people are aware to this dirty Zionist game!! #ireland #dublin
Shameless so-called "journalism".
FAR RIGHT TROPE Getting real Old!!   This happens in a 'Black' area, then what!?       ....it's going to be BLACK ON BLACK isn't it...  In a Muslim area,...  NOT REPORTED   These Rags truly are The Enemy of the People!
Again who said it was far right.more media hype fromthe telegraph .this is bad journalism trying to make a story .
Lol its not far right at all...this will happan all over Europe as Islamic terrorism increases. Most irish are pro Palestine so jihadhis see that as a weakness to exploit. SHURA 9.14
It's time for Ireland to deport Muslim refugees , this is just going to get worse over time
Conflict in Gaza have reached Ireland, as Irish stand with the Palestinians.
“Far right” This reporting is disgraceful
As always the right is always right
Far-right? That's how your filthy midia are going  to play this game till the elections??!! This is  all a result of your far-left ideological open borders police. We don't fall for this BS of yours anymore!
And the young people who go to break into shops and steal from them! Shame on these young people!
right wing the only ones with guts
Did hooligans from England infiltrated Dublin or hooligans originally came from Ireland?
lo, 'far right' ! these are Irish people trying to get back their country! well done Irish ! dont end up like the Brits or worse, like Belgium.
A little girl has been Murdered by a FAR RIGHT, Jew Hating, Woman Bashing, Homosexual mutilating, ISLAMIST,  REPORT THAT!!
Leave it to the liberal media to deflect to the "Far-Right".. while intentionally not labeling the Race, Nationality, And religion of the suspect like they would if it was a "White Christian male" 😒
Ignorance is the fuel the far right thrive on. Morons, I thought right wingers believed in law and order? Criminal thugs nothing more, just looking for any excuse to do harm to society and property. Darwin!
"far right" says the legacy media
Time to start embracing the label "Far RIght"
Far right my arse enough with the guilt trips ..stabbing chidren going to school
Aren't Irish ancestors once immigrants to America. Why are they acting like African Americans of BLM...are Irish thugs or civilized people with a grain of empathy.  Looting and setting stores ablaze supposed to signature acts of people from poor ghettos...😢o
Typical Telegraph saying its Far Right! NO, It’s citizens saying they have had enough!
Ik snap het
Isn’t this a form of colonisation - elites imposing their laws of immigration on an indigenous population to its detriment?
The Far Right are decent people who don’t agree with the governments evil agenda to dominate the people of Ireland instead of representing Irish people
far right ? this name calling is what we are up against people all the time...most of us are centered normal people,  the left are so lost and now literally anything they dont like is far right, look at the ratio 70-80% of us are now far right far right is now just a fading old scare word used to deter people from joining forces, it is over used like racism the left are failing to manipulate and control people with there terms any more.
Just release the name and nationality.  Very simple. Or media dont want to because islam is religion of peace?
Far right bollocks it is. This is Irish people who have had enough of Muslims who try and kill their own people. The Telegraph STOP TELLING LIES.
The Far Right means the decent law abiding citizens.
So quick to label it 'far right'. Hopefully we wake up to this propaganda being shoved down our throats by 'reliable' news sources
BLM do this and it’s ‘most;y peaceful protest’ - white people do it cos their community is coming undone and it’s ‘far-right extremists’! Lol
Why is it when lefties take to the streets it's peaceful but when anybody who is not left leaning has to be considered far right. Disgusting
Pahahaha its people against INVADORS nothing far right here. Take your Country back ❤❤❤
Far right, really? Do not trust mainstream media they're bigots, liars and absolutely not to be trusted. Normal citizens of western culture have had enough of this failed experiment called multiculturalism. This all started with Mr Blair and co 30 years ago.  Stand up to the Globalists who are trying to dilute the very fabric of western culture and Democracy.
We are all far right
People is fed up with the unfair defence of violence of Muslim individuals by the police. As a legal immigrant that love UK and the English way of life, I am also fed up.
Every country taking in Muslim immigrants has an exponentially worsening security problem.    😡
Far right 😂😅😂😅
Irish people for years and still standing with Palestine, maybe now they will start to understand what Israelis was  warning for decades "the west is the next"
😂😂, far right my arse, Ordinary people sick and tired of not being listened to
I'm confused... a brown person committed a crime and now people are rioting? Do white Irish people not commit crimes at all? What's the fuss about?
Stop looting. Go to the politicians offices!
If the police had told the truth then this might not have happened the Irish politicians are to blame for all this
Far right? There’s no far right in Eire for chrisakes!
Media today, trying their best to distract over identity of knifeman "ooh look at the Brazilian guy who heroically stepped in" a look over there tactic to divert from the truth,  while demonstrators are branded far right
Stop this nonsense of calling this far right.  This is people defending their homes and their very lives from forced immigration in to their cities and neighborhoods.  I am with the people of Ireland on this one.
Keep saying this is Far Right, and guess what, the Far Right will rise.  So go on please, keep giving the Far Right the credit for expressing what people feel. - The media is not correctly reading the rage that is building in European countries. Cultural Enrichment has divided us. But it is going to ultimately unite indigenous people once again. So carry on Telegraph, great job.
In America when black people riot like this against police brutality, the comments here are all 'evil blacks destroyijg innocent people's property'  Here though, it's all encouraged.
The Telegraph. Traitors supporting evil itself.
What's going on?  Is there a shortage of candles in Dublin?  Don't they know 'Don't look back in Anger'?   I thought Oasis were quite big in Ireland.  I'm confused.
I wish people standing their ground in germany aswell
Not  far right people have had enough and the politicians do nothing
*Being opposed to evil is ‘far-right’ now?* *I guess I’m a proud member of the far-right then.*
Of course they have to control the narrative guys.
The telegraph must be owned by far left radicals, fight against the radicals invading your country Ireland!
I don`t think these are any far-right extremist, just ordinary Dubliners who are angry. Support to Ireland from the Czech Republic!
Irish people protest against radical muslims - its racism.   An Islamic terrorist kills irish people - its okay
Europe was awakened by the brave people of Ireland. Fed up with all his bullshit
A corrupt government will allways cause unrest among the people, its time!!.
“We know that they are lying, they know that they are lying, they even know that we know they are lying, we also know that they know we know they are lying too, they of course know that we certainly know they know we know they are lying too as well, but they are still lying. In our country, the lie has become not just moral category, but the pillar industry of this country.” Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn   I stand with our Irish Brothers !
What a bias reporting of more brain washing of the public, these aren't right wing, these are normal people just sick of knife crime
Being opposed to evil is "far right" now
Welcome refugees
The Telegraph Far Left Bullshit News Paper,
Not far right but fed up!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Kick out all those fu****g so called asylum seekers. It's a plan by saudi and other muslim countries to destroy peacefulness in Europe  and other countries
Geert Wilders gefeliciteerd met je verkiezingsoverwinning
Why won't the police reveal the identity of the attacker? 🤔🙄
Israel has been forced to do the problem
*Guess which tribe runs the media and wrote this article …*
All the things I've been through if only I had that kind of backup power.
So I agree with having a good welfare system, believe energy should be nationalized, teachers and nurses should be paid more, believe we should build millions of new homes and fund the healthcare system much better than we currently do but because i want controlled immigration im far right, ok got it 😂
"Far right"  anyone thays stands up for their country
Far right??? Absolute BS
The media are evil to its core, why won't they mention where the attacker was from originally, it DOES matter due to the fact he is Algerian and Muslim and these attacks are common amongst this group
Is the stabbing far right too ?
Remember, your politicians and their policies are to blame here.
*Ireland has a right to defend itself.*
The Telegraphs headline is exactly why the corporate media is dying.
😮wtf
This is not a protest, this is a pure riot
Far Right My Arse!!
From far left news!
Bro even black people I know here in the city are sick of immigration, it's not about racism THESE PEOPLE'S CULTURES DON'T MIX WITH OURS!
That is horrible don’t safe in Dublin anymore
The world needs to understand.  Open borders do not work
It's pretty ironic these Dubliners are violently attacking police and other local residents and destroying their own city while at the same time claiming that "immigrants" are violently attacking people and destroying their city. Theses are clearly some not very intelligent people here lol.
Even supposedly right-wing media such as the Daily Telegraph peddling the "it's all down to the far right" rubbish.
Interestingly they somehow know that the mob is far right but for some reason they are not able to provide any information on the attackers background.
They come to destroy! Ireland must leave the European Union or it will vanish!
Far Left BS!
Why is it far right cu n ts?!
And now look at countries that have far right leaders . Poland Hungary they dont have this going on on their streets . Holland now following .we need leaders like this because soon our countries will be like Israel split up them and us and all our hard work turned into pits
I'm surprised people are defending the burning down and destroying of the city. Guess who's going to pay for all that?
So now right wingers agree that riots are okay when someone is murdered ?
Far right?  Looks like people that have had enough.  No labels.
As we heard the attacker from Israel, be careful of this game
A country with no borders is not a country
Far right…my arse. There can’t be that many young ‘far right’ people in the whole of Ireland.
Drew Harris was part off special branch in Belfast, we all know what they done
Ireland needs a Geert Wilders.
What’s the purpose of setting fire to a bus and cars aswell as rioting what’s the correlation to the individuals that were stabbed …?
Thats not far right. That's irish citizens showing their anger. I'm just surprised they didn't deal with the monster themselves.
Standing up for your community is labeled "far-right"
Ireland has it own Hamas! Now let’s see how they will handle atrocities against innocent Irish civilians.
We have had enough
Mostly peaceful protest ❤
Embarassing journalism. We aren't blind nor scared
when police  and the government fail to do their job and the public kick off its is called far right ,it is justice they seek
The "stabbing" is beginning to look a lot like Mossad! Cue Bono? Who would benefit? Just when the Irish people were vehemently protesting Israel's Genocide on Palestinians!
The Irish have balls, that's great! If all Europeans were like that, everything would be different. I don't see why we should welcome Muslims who want to replace us.
It not right far. The Irish people are fed up this rubbish and being lied too. Their are standing up to globalist
It was a matter of time that Zionist MOSSAD ORGANIZED FAKE FLAG PROVOCATION in PRO-PALESTINIAN IRELAND.
The "press" still has yet to release the name of the Muslim perpetrator.
This is the second mass stabbing by islamists in Europe this week , people have had enough
Is this a proportional response?
Who decides what far right is. What is just right VS far right
The only people who think this is Far Right is the Far Left
The telegraph is fake news. These are not far right protesters, these are citizens protesting for the safety of their own and fighting against the tyrannical policies of the corrupt politicians who rule over them.
Los asquerosos políticos europeos matan a su población para traer gente incorrecta!! Despierta Europa antes de que sea tardé!!!
So sick of people being labelled far right when they stand up fot themselves.  Governments are to blame for this anger. Prayers to those hurt 🙏
Just scrotes out looking to loot and burn public property that they probably haven't paid taxes towards.
We're getting there.
Police, government, and MSM would like to make a fool of us. The knife man is kept in the dark, but protesters would be accused and prosecuted quickly. Nice. Muslim protesters can do whatever they like. Others not at all. Even a minister would be put aside because of telling the truth about that. MSM never mentions the knife attack but highlights the riots. This is not a riot, but a descent try to get back your country. Police supports the wrong side. Why? Who did begin that? As ever, a lone nut? Come on.
Far right.. no it's Irish people having a gutsful
Absolute fcking morons this is so embaressing. I understand the anger but wrecking the place is a really supid way to go about it. Please pray for the baby in hospital she need everyone right now.
It's just a fiery but mostly peaceful protest.
What a bunch of clowns. When black people in USA riot due to a person being killed by police, they are called criminals, people who just want to cause destruction and steal. HOW ARE THESE CLOWNS ANY DIFFERENT. TO claim they are doing this in defence of those who were hurt , or stealing to combat immigration is fcking ridiculous.
Immigrants didn't loot Irish shops in Dublin or damage Irish property. It was our own Irish did this.
Has the Telegraph interviewed these protesters and asked them why they are rioting? Nope, just easier to call them all Far Right and dismiss them with total contempt.
Far right violence? What moron wrote this? This is a direct reaction to the action of importing violent, rapist immigrants that needs to stay in their own country.
Funny how it's always "FAR RIGHT" try reporting the truth for once, that people are sick of importing violent thugs into their countries.
Considering at first police said it was a "suspected terrorist event" we know exactly who did this.
Telegraph should change the headline , in to people of Dublin are fighting for justice. Get all the terrorists immigrants and supporters out of the country and ban them to enter the country.
Ireland is the majot country who supported gazze against to israrl amd its so obvious mossad will trigger their guys to make set up increase hate against to muslims.... this is one more game of zionists....
The Telegraph call all white working class people 'far-right'
Justified. No need to tolerate the intolerable.
Far right, that’s rediculous!
Far right??? What a disgusting headline.. so basically any indigenous people who have a problem becoming a minority in their ancestral homelands whilst their most vulnerable are slaughtered are considered far right? Then being far right should be a title to be proud of.. even if it is just inflammatory rhetoric.
The Torygraph is a liar test.
Vous allez vite comprendre que la racailles arrive de partout, la france en est pleine.
Hmmmm... hiding the identity of the criminal(s).  I wonder why...
Far right 🤷‍♂️ Ppl are sick of the immergrants and how the government are pushing this far right nonsense too
Far right!??!!?!!?!!!?!!?
What was the point of fighting to get your country for hundreds of years just to have it given away again within 3 or 4 generations? And that's from a northern Prod. Impossible for Irish people to find a house and hotel prices about 3 times what they were 5 years ago because they're full of "refugees". And the media is the same leftist narrative in every western country.
Totally agree with the comments that is NOT far right but as usual the bought, paid for corrupt Telegraph along with all major main stream media outlets will print what they are TOLD to say. The Irish people rightly so have had enough
But it was a "mostly peaceful protest".  Just ask CNN.  Oh, wait, that exemption only applies to BLM and Antifa. Never mind.
The IRISH PEOPLE STAND UP FOR THEMSELVES FINALLY.. BUT THE CRONIC FASCIST MEDIA TRY TO CRIMINALISE THEM FOR SAYING ENOUGH IS ENOUGH
The far wrong media cries wolf yet again
The terrorist will probably blame Israel😂😂😂
October 7th on his way to Europe!
This is yet another proof that the war us not israel-hamas But radical islam against civilization
Far right? Thats rich from a Shylock publication.
NO MORE IMMIGRANTS! EVERY DAY OUR PEOPLE ARE STABBED, RAPED AND ATTACKED BY FOREIGNERS
wtf is wrong with this world? everything is crazy.
Muslims just bringing trouble wherever they go
Stop djhadism ! Don't give up irish people !
Far right 😂 a term , like racism that has lost any sense of meaning . For far right read pissed off normal people with a genuine grievance.
Far right?  Now that is laughable ... we see the agenda here.
So how far right are they, telegraph bullshit that's why no one reads your rag
Aha, so a Muslim attacks 5yr olds with a knife and every news outlet tries to hide it and calls the protests far right.. Media BS right here...
Far Right (media speak for indigenous people sick of being disrespected)
Your reporting on this is shameful Telegraph 😢😢
Trust a bunch of knuckle-dragging troglodytes to hijack a tragedy and invalidate any sort of mature discourse or investigation.
Not far right.....pressure of not been listened to by government...people afraid to say the truth..well.ill say it to many people coming into the country .housing crisis crime going crazy city has changed to this horrible place..friends DUBLIN is gone..shame on government. Full stop.
Destroying businesses. This is not a peaceful protest.
They call them far right and this is why geert wilders won in the Netherlands
Telegraph is the enemy
Far right?? lol
This has nothing to do with the stabbing. Absolutely senseless.
Far right??? Did ya stop and ask political views?
This "Far-right" narrative is no longer working, open your eyes, smell the coffee and start reporting reality, people are pissed that citizens are continually being targeted, abused and demeaned by people who are in their countries illegally - stop trying to paper over the cracks, grow some balls and report FACTS - Governments need to start standing up for their citizens or quite frankly they need booted out of any position of power they have and replaced by people who are actually going to work on getting the country back to what it once was. This crap has got to stop!
Stop WHO treaty!!!! Prayers for tge victims
“Straight up propaganda and Lies” - NOT far right……
Reportedly Algerian
Far right?????
This comment section :  " is not Far-Right using street violence/riots to push for anti emigration laws"
Telegraph hate already throws a political lie not knowing the Left or the Right SEE Demon😮
Not far right . Just right.
The Walking Dead Migrants invasion
Lol 😂 Irish people have been migrating to the U.K. and the USA for work for decades. Shame on them .
Far right ??? Ya mean just right
From the river to the sea Algeria will be free.....😆😅🤣😉😊😇☺😃😀😄😄😄😄😄
The Telegraph should be banned. Lying media…
Far right, no just right
Why has it flared up. Was it an immigrant who stabbed them
Dublin Stands with Gaza
Freedom to Algeria! Not just in Dublin, but in the entire Ireland. End the occupation of Ireland and give back territory to Algerian terrorists😄😃😀😁😆
Just watched a video about an Israeli spy that was caught in iraq, she impersonated an arab woman with fake passport and background story, her main mission was to cause civil unrest exactly like this.... Wont put it pass them TBH.
Band Islam in every country
This seems like a highly disproportional response of the Irish people to the actions of an algerian freedom fighter who was merely testing his knife.🤭🤗..
Garda & polititians making excuses for their idiotic decisions, let criminals into the country then protect them...
Glad the people in this comment section have sense
Media is a tool for leftists. It is no longer a value to free people
Every Musli🐫m lives a devil inside him who hates everything that is different from him. Beware of them, they are treacherous
Ban islam
It's really bad when the far right are justified in their fury. Mess.
It’s not far right 😡
A quick question for the irish govt, why do the irish play second fiddle to the radical immigrants
The mood of the country ! Varadkar has to go as do his migrants,the criminals that is .
Time to ban immigrants from the uk
'Far=Right' in Dublin? No just Irish people sick of uncontrolled mass immigration! The Far-Left have proven that wherever they are in Power society collapses!
Far right??????
No idea who did it but the far right hit the streets trashing the place. Nothing in the head.
This is what Swedes should do! All European countries should refuse the Islamic invasion!
This violence from these thugs is absolutely unacceptable.😰 What the heeell are they thinking. They’re bloody insane.
The telegraph is calling them Far right because they are fighting for their country.. The leftist don't want to acknowledge what's going on there, they only want to appease the knife attackers.
Its not far right its the people bad journalism again tossers .
Far right or concerned citizens !!!
Lol so the blm riots was far right as well. What Ireland is doing is going to bring shockwaves to the rest of Europe and the Uk. If true that this was a asylum seeker then these events will take place across Europe and uk as the people have had enough its time to stop helping.
I stand with the Irish
"Far right". The lame excuse by "Progressive" elites to crush any opposing views. Meanwhile the terrorist is a innocent lamb
These rioters are the terrorists.
Of course they lead off with "far right"... This isn't a left vs right issue, this is the public vs their elected officials who have been ignoring and gaslighting them for far too long.  And it isn't only happening in Ireland.
Far right?
Животные блин. Лишь бы разгромить и обворовать. 😡
"Justified violence flares in Dublin after five-year-old girl seriously hurt in knife attack"...."Get them out!!! Get them out !!!"
Couple months back I saw a pack of ignorant skinny’s roam flashing their knives in the comments I read the most alike. They don’t know what country their in
May this uprising spread across the entire Western world. Immigrants OUT NOW!
I am proud to see the Irish rise up to protect their homeland from Islamic invasion and violence.
Misinformation say authorities? Well, who withholds the truth?
Take back your country. Those Islamic extremist asylum seekers shouldn't be in Europe in the first place!!!!
Far right? 😂
Israeli Mossad behind it
This whole diversity scam exposed
Where is the "fighting Irish"...   this is your country..stand up for it...  stop calling a commmon sense response to this  nightmare.. as 'far right '   The media has a lot to answer for..
Irish are a different breed to the english !!! They won’t take no crap !! These illegals need to go they aren’t adaptable to live in our country’s !
How many attacks by 'refugees' are the Irish people supposed to 'tolerate' ?
"Far-right" my arse!   FU Telegraph!!
London next.
THIS ISNT FAR-RIGHT
We're tired of globalism and his friends.
It's not far right people at all! It's civilians who have had enough of the dangers this un welcome mass migration has brought to our towns and cities! I love visiting Ireland for breaks away! The country and the Irish people are amazing! Sadly I'm not in any hurry to visit soon :-( As an English man I stand with the Irish on keeping your country safe anyway possible! God bless those poor people and those babies injured by yet another migrant! Things really do need to change on migration asap! It's ruining our home lands!
Ireland will be free
Don’t forget to support Palestine…
STOP ISLAM !!!!!
These protesters & rioters are part of the problem (in cahoots). Someone stabs a 5yr old & no one sees it? Some damage or fire happens & nobody takes out their phone to record & call the cops?  Everyone's just mad & random atracks . . . what's that solve? Up your alerts & spread out!!!
((THEIR)) grip is slipping, KEEP FIGHTING
Hasbara Tube
God we hate lefties in Canada now.
Who reads the Belly laugh? It is leftist, globalist toilet paper.
Fiery but "Mostly Peaceful".
"Far Right" Yeah..
This is not Far right ! This is patriotism !
Far right what a rag of a media outlet
Far right really? These are patriots who love their country
Ban islam and quran, deport all muslims including legal and non legal...
So the protesters are "far right" but the attacker, what is he? "Far" what? Mass Media is a absolute joke... Don't let them leave it unpunished
Yet more biased BS from the leftie MSM
In other news, "Far Left" reporter gets it wrong again.
Male was Algerian 🇩🇿 Nuslim guy
BLACK LIVES MATTER ???? ************************************************************
Male was Algerian 🇩🇿 Muslim guy
Say no to muslim immigrants
🤮🤮✡🤮🤮 THANKS JEWS
Far Right or trouble makers?
Islam will conquer Europe
It is horribly true. The citizens are just defending themselves when the government doesn’t
these days anything thats not far left insanity is deemed far right by the poisonous press.
It's because the far-left have flooded Europe with dangerous Islamists that wants to kill us. So now they try to cover up their act and blame everything on everybody else or the "far-right"...
If the left does this it's OK???? FU Telegraph
this is not 'far right' anything. This is what happens when good men have had enough
This far right narrative from the telegraph is disgusting.
#saveablonddrownamigrant
NYC has been bankrupted by the illegal migration situation.  All city agencies have been cut.
As a French , i stand for the Irish people. This is why we have to fight against massive immigration .🇨🇵 🇮🇪
There is always this attempt by authoritative powers around the world to subdue local population with influx of outside population and thus maintaining their hegemony
Isn't it strange that when the native population stands against evil, they are always portrayed as far right? Very strange indeed.
It’s like seeing a nightmare come true, this is almost too dystopian. This world is getting crazy!
Left lies
Stop Islamization
Adolf Hitler destroyed Europe blatantly and vehemently.  European Union has destroyed Europe concealedly and quietly.
FAR RIGHT VIOLENCE???? Get a grip on yourselves. Liars.
A baby kitten counts as far right these days. Do they seriously think that label has any teeth left in it?
"far right" well, I think we know what kind of person came up with the headline..
Not 'Far-Right', just people sick of being ignored by the elites.
"""""Far right"""""
Hmmmm Ireland always support Palestine and now this happen, is this a coincidence???
This is the price to pay for letting ilegal invaders into your country. Something needs to be done to stop these leniant Immigration Laws, weak governments and hypocrite Media who always want us to feel sorry for the others.
How is it far right ?
Lazy newspaper
Dublin is paying the price for supporting Palestine and standing up to Israel.
Not a terror incident, another mental illness excuse. How do they know so soon it's not terror related, sounds like it.
far right telegraph supports israel
Not far right just some ticked off real Irish people.
Anyone who believes the so-called news is a dope addict. They must know we no longer trust them.
This is disgusting reporting, the telegraph have really gone down to the pits of Hell to put that.   My guesses, it's content created by a non British national
Left: Mostly peaceful protests Right: Extreme violent riots
Far right?
Thats not far-right..those shop,those cars,thats stelling using the situation to stell..
Fun fact: Members of the media (on all sides) were tribunaled during the Nuremberg Trials in 1946.  Many were executed for treason and for  broadcasting propaganda.  😃
Migrant terrorist stabs good citizens so the tax paying indigenous community are most unhappy and rightfully so
The media will lose this battle
See how the frame their lies............"far right"???
These people from the religion of peace calls for jihad against the west, I guess it's damn time christians start calling for a crusade.
Trow the Muslim immigrants out
Far right because they're mad a 5 year old got stabbed? Typical liberal garbage
Disgusting behavior of the rioters, especially after an immigrant was the hero of the day.
Who was hurt in the knife attack? What happened?
Far left “news” agency engages in propaganda instead of reporting the news.
I thought right-wing protesters didn’t vandalize their own place? that’s what they told me
Irishmen taking back Ireland, about damn time
Just citizens tired of the muslims violence
What's the point of vandalism?
Looks mostly peaceful
Love the Irish!!!!
They need to establish Islamic law to stop the attacks.
"Far right"?
White people wake up!
More like patriots who care about there history and culture.
How is standing for common decency far right? What nonsense.
"Far right" means normal, proportionate response to importing the third world?
The man who committed this heinous act..sinn Fein walked with his comrades last week in support of hamas
Now the anger becomes real, please deport all illegal migrant people
Far right ... says the tarther left
The Telegraph is absolutely defect-left media outlet. So irritating 🤬🤬🤬
Notice when the leftists mobs and the invaders go berserk in the streets the domestic enemy state run media NEVER calls the far left extremists or religious fanatics.
Fake news
DEUS VULT. 🔥🔥🔥
Ireland beware of your media and and the leftards!
No one mentions the far east the far south the far north
If this is far right then what is the attacker?
Disgusting what the news and media does.
FREE FREE ALGERIA ❤ IRISH REPUBLIC is MUSLIM LAND , IRISH OCCUPIERS
How on earth do we know that this is, "far right", violence. Were any of the participants canvassed as to their political views?
Here come the twisted news reports by the media
Not far right. Government won’t listen.
Stand up for your COUNTRY!!
Just call them muslim immigrants who are ungrateful and want to turn Europe into Darul Islam and push Europe into dark ages like how they did to their own countries, why hide behind ambiguity.
Anything the liberals don't like is automatically "far right."
American political terms such as "far right" are hardly applicable for Ireland. Seems like a highly curated title
So what was the attackers ethnicity though? Was it a brown person? 😮
so called news call everything right of the lefties , far right ...
He`s Algerian , FACT !
Far right? More media bullshit. Good for the Irish🇮🇪
Fight for Ireland . Fine. Looting is not part of that.
How is it far right ? Nonsense
What’s ’far right’??
It was an immigrant that stabbed the people and this has angered the community. Typical that the media portray as far right and don't post a picture of the suspect because he's not white. They would have posted  picture of the suspect had they been white. The MSM are trash and nobody believes your outright lies or lies by ommision👀
close borders now, no entry. Ban Islam now and deport these migrants now.  Go live in Muslims countries!!!!!!!!!!! wake up Europe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Israel is spreading terrorism in countries that support Palestine, especially in Europe. Netanyahu has given instructions to the Mossad to do so because he has lost external support, and we will see such operations frequently in all Western countries, America and Canada. Beware, Arabs.
Yes we stand with the ppl. LoL far right? WTH
They are NOT right wing.  They are fathers and mothers
Not all Muslims are terrorists. But Ireland belongs to the Irish.
What a coincidence, ireland was the only country who took a hard stand against israel and now all of a sudden a riot breaks out, SOME people are mad at govt, Haven’t we seen this in Libya, syria, pakistan, iraq etc.  zionists have strong hold everywhere.
I think it's time to get rid of the propaganda. Here is one deal which sounds nice: Before the harmful replacement migrants have to go, all accomplices such as officials, NGOs, every monkey of the EU and of course especially everyone who took part in the anti-white media will be expelled, that would now be a mercy. Let's stop the replacement migration and hold those involved accountable.
Good bye Europe.
an accurate headline would read - "volatile protest in wake of 5 year old stabbed by man - who's identity and citizen status the government refuses to elaborate on" - this is clearly a POS network.
where is the CCTV footage of this attack and who carried it out?
misleading headline
This is not far right this is people sticking up for there own country anyway who believes the media anymore
Headlines like this only wake people up to the political/media agenda
Looks like a firey but mostly peaceful protest to me....
When the other side does it, their voices need to be heard. They are marginalized.  The people of the west can not keep silent they countries have been open up for people who do not respect them or their traditions. They have no love for the country. Liberals have destroyed the west on purposes the blood lost during the great wars was in vein.
This attack provoque TERROR....but this is not a TERRORist attack.....im confuse.....
What is this far right far left nonsense? We're not asking for directions here... 😂 Standing up for your people is far right? Okay...
Not far right, coward reporting
Not far right more fake news
will wait for the authorities’ investigations and we will know everything 🤷🏻‍♂️
It's not far right.
They are destroying their own country . This is not proper way of protesting . I don't understand as how they are from civilized nation .
Irish don't mess around. This is not far right violence, this is justice. Get over yourself.
So, some immigrant stabbed up  a little girl and some others?    OK, I understand now God help the people.
Far right where did ye get that from.
Why us being a patriot, proud of and fighting for ones country labelled as Far right. Being white is now Far right ????  MSM /WEF/EU/BBC at work.....
🇮🇪
Far leftists have imposed mass 3rd world migration that has introduced lower IQ peoples who commit more crime.This is a crime against all western nations committed by cosmopolitan elites.They must be made to pay for thier crimes when all is said and done.
This isn't far right "Telegraph"!!!!!. Get with it and understand that we are all F%*£ed off with this! the politicians don't listen or don't care, and the police side with the Jihadis' who are carrying out the Caliphate right under our noses! These scumbags ALL need sending back to their country of origin. Hopefully the people of the UK will be next to show their disgust on the streets.
The Media is Far Wrong
we don't tolerate islamic barbarist terror.. take Ireland back.. we don't want them here.. no one asked us to take them in... eye for eye.. now!!!!
Far-right which is code for normal people frustrated by insane Far-left policies that are ruining countries. It's always great to see honest reporting from the nutbag biased media complex.
Go for the media buildings also, they lie about everything!
European media is funded by Qatar
"Far right" sure
These people are not "far right" . Enough with your propaganda.
Ireland needs to leave Europe and all it's bullshit fast or we won't have anything left to leave for.
Where are the immigrants from, how did they get into Ireland? Your politicians allowed that to happen and the citizens supported them. It’s a democratic country anyway and all are responsible
Fake cheap media,,,, far right my arse 😮
Riots are the voice of the unheard!!!
Liberal extreme leftie news papers are for traitors only !
Far right, my arse.
oct 7 is spreading
We respect Ireland & love Irish. Hope Dublin is back to peace ❤ from Indonesia.
I think the ppl have been too lenient on the justice system for too long, if the ppl won’t demand change none will come
Everything I dont like is far right
Far Right ?  I am sure Trump has something to do with it then  :D   MIGA   - Make Ireland Great Again  :D
They ain't there for a 9-5
Better to be far right than far wrong i guess.
All muslims should be deported from europe.
When did the Irish go from left to far right? When they didn't agree with your agenda?
The Telegraph seems like a far left lunatic.  😂
Was it British?
How is this far right exactely?
Far right?
deadliest warrior season 1 episode 9 about to play out irl
Liberal leftist destroyed Europe with woke propaganda
Nice title traitors, but patience isn't infinite.
It's the second news story since yesterday about a stabby migrant.
Dislike the video for protecting criminals.
And I am sure all those people in NY and such saying kick the immigrants out were far right as well.
And the police warn against 'misinformation'?
Far right?? 😂😂
Their patience has finally started to wear out. This is long over due.
breaking news irish people using violence against violence muslims that stabbed and killed two 13 year olds   deport all immigrants and leftist traitors  o/
Better to be far-right than far wrong
Free Palestine from the river to the sea.
This is the voice of the unheard. The protests were fiery but mostly peaceful. They’re not particularly unruly
Report this for misinformation
Far right tag again..... people just ain't buying this excuse anymore,it's not far right to want a homeland.
Nah that’s not what far right means.
Far right, but not far wrong
Bravo to the Irish citizens who stood up for their society. If BLM and pro Palestine ppl can riot to be taken seriously then so can the Irish.
All the far-right knows is bigotry and violence. That’s the only language they speak.
Nice to see there's still white people with balls out there.
Time for a global change this  mass immigration bs doesn’t work
There are ways to address the serious issues in Dublin without destroying the city.
Diversity is our greatest strength.
It better not be a middle eastern who did it or Palestine is really fukd
Why havnt they named or given a description of who has done it then ?
How is it far right it's just right
😢
What are the Media Thought Police going to call Irish Patriots when 60% of the people are "far right"? There was an earthquake in the Netherlands a couple of days ago. I think the presstitutes in the media are getting nervous.
Of course the lying media are going to label this as Far Right..That is a blatant Lie.Dknt fall for this government Propaganda
'Anti - immigration' lol... Nice headline loser.
The UK plan to displace the Irish continues despite the delays.
People are awake to what is going on. Kalergi Plan!
Far right violence? Lol. The legacy media is sick. They're evil and are attempting to gaslight us all. We the people know what's up now. That rubicon has been passed.
Nothing "Far right" about it, this is "Righteous". The press is lying and has been for years. #enemedia
But when Antifa do this, it’s never ‘far left’. The hypocrisy is clear.
Why label this far right?  Immediate discredit of the so called media source
Notice how the Telegraph tries to spin the news...👎
Does it take a lot of energy to twist the truth?
From whatever am seeing of leftist media response, the day is not far off when they will be jobless and without viewers, as has happened in India.
Far right my arse!
The 5 year old girl is dead god bless her, the media are keeping it quiet though
It's everyone even the communist Far Left.
Your liberal propaganda is weak.
Why is nobody bringing up the looting on this one? Is it bc its mostly white people or smthn doing this one?
Europeans are being murdered  and replaced.
Ireland is one of the most woke countries in the world, they need one Geert Wilders
Ya gonna change the title to that article yet Telegraph?
Muslims asylum seekers must be thrown out.
IDIOTS DESTROYING THEIR OWN INFRASTRUCTURES BUSINESS,FWITS
Muslims immigration must be stopped
They should’ve protested like this when a g@y Pakistani become their prime minister
The Irish people and the Dutch voters give me hope. European lives matter!
Who wrote this “far right “ title ?     Not impartial description !         Not the journalist standards expected of the Telegraph.  Do better .
UK politicians .,WATCH
Far right 😂😂😂
Now we know about global warming.
!!!!!!!!⚠️⚠️Any and all Irish people please be advised *200+* of these *illegal Muslim migrants and subsaharan Africans* are being *housed on hatch street in the hatch hall building* by our govt using our taxpayer money⚠️⚠️!!!!!!!!!
We don't have a far right problem. We have a far left problem.
The text reads "swarms of young men wearing masks" while showing video where the majority are NOT wearing masks. Bie Lie Propaganda at it's finest
Not far right…people are fed up
the protesters should have proclaimed themselves Antifa and wore BLM hoodies. it would have been described as mostly peaceful protests.
irelandwhataJOKEyouare
Just looks like a bunch of punk opportunist to me, causing more havoc, pain and loss for their country.
Far Right is almost like a made up Fable in today's times
Looks mostly peaceful to me.
“Far right” 🤦🏻‍♂️
Only limp wrist commies would describe based Irishmen as far-right.
'far right violence' my hole. this has been coming down the line in Dublin especially, but in Ireland for YEARS. the mainstream news provider, recently embroiled in several scandals only mentioned that there had been a stabbing attack tonight as a bloody goddamn afterthought, as law and order has been gradually eroding in Ireland with an incompetent police force and ethnic violence sowed.   its great that we have outfits like sky news a BRITISH one engaging in the censorship we've come to expect. shame on fine gael, FF, the cowardice of the guards and the media in Ireland for attempting to hurriedly paint this is as not being terror. th fact that people are stunned is audacious
It's not far right. Propagandists
THIS "WAS" AN ISLAMIC TERROR ATTACK that for the first time the Irish authorities did not confirm this.  Disgraceful...Sticking up for those Islamic Terrorists..Shameful !!😡😡😡
This is the government's fault opening the gates and let imagrants people are fed up with all these imagrants,iam in England but iam supporting the Irish here well done dublin stand up to immigration
Anything labeled Far-right extremism now means Far-Left caused problems...
Does this not fall under a "mostly peaceful protest" ??
Stupid scumbags burning cars trams and shops and hotels.  How dare they wave the Irish Flag . They don't represent Ireland at all and not real Irish !!!
Looks like the Irish have had enough, and rightly so.
Unfortunately the Irish Government sent in their plants (antifa) to masquerade as Irish far right. Normal Irish protesters wouldn't do this, not even the right wing. The Irish government house wasn't touched so this is staged to deflect from the horrific stabbings and to influence public opinion about the nonexistent 'far right'
Far left media call this far right violence.   LOL
Why are they rioting. We currently do not know if a migrant committed the stabbing and if it was a migrant rioting would not do anything  about it. And painting all migrants with the same brush is wrong as the majority of murders in this country are committed by irish citizens
Sick and tired of hearing this term, far right. I stand with the Irish people. Riots are usually the language of the unheard. Stop labelling people and sit down and talk to them. This could all be avoided.
Usual trash far-right nonsense. The people have had enough of being lied to.
“Far Right!” Unbelievable!!!   This agenda becomes more and more sinister by the day!!!
Look at the muggy media calling them far right , nooo they men who have had enough of illegal migrants raping and killing there fellow County people
There is no “far right” in Ireland,   these are just ordinary people protesting against our joke of a government
The five years old girl he stabbed has just died. RIP.
I just love their leftists "any excuse to blame conservatives" angle to describe a population of peaceful citizens tired of being screwed over by the very liberalism that has created all the poverty, crime, etc thay directly correlates to this.... than when peoples have had enough, & snap, they're painted into a narrative.
News source is pos. Someone's baby is in the hospital and the news wants to start with the politics! GTFO
CNN andMSNBC says this sort of activity is mostly peaceful!  Cheers mate
Unemployed, thugs with no future. Usually on the red line luas, looking for their next hit. Pure thick
Far right ? 😂
"far right"  fkutelegrph
Just people protesting against violence brought about by unwanted violent immigrants.
The far-right is made up of terrorists, just like Israel and ISIS
Europe is beyond repair.  It's destroyed totally from within.
How does vandalising our own stores work into this?
Blaming an entire group for the actions of one person from that group. That's a left wing perspective, not a right wing one.
How are they far right ?
not a far right
I lived in Ireland 4 years , and in my opinion Ireland opened the doors  to people that doesn't deserve , that doesnt work just disturb the peace of others! I wont give nationalities .
I like all the media labels angry citizens as far right
I guess I’m Far-Right ➡️
stop letting in all of africa, stop calling them far right.  They just don't want to live in fear.  Ireland is a white Irish nation, very simple.
This stapping is from a some one person who lunatic it doesn't have any thing to do with foreign people . And this people who are doing holigans in dublin streets are just taking it as an excuses to do all this horrific madness things
Far-right ? No just right. We're getting walked all over, killed even. While politicians/MEPs, lefty- globalist elite live in their mansions.
Immediately it's far right. What utter B S. Nothing about the attacker. I'm not right or far right ( whatever that means) I'm just outraged.
More cope and gaslighting from the political-media class.
Shame on telegraph for say " far right "
Unbelievable they can't get a description of the guy but had the time to go and ask every single person their political beliefs...
Deport them all .. NOW!
Far right? Liberal propaganda much?
Make Dublin free and send them back to the sea!
I'm sure the gards would have been quick to tell us if he was Irish.. clearly they're protecting him.. him and ALL of the illegal and undocumented and dangerous men entering our country ILLEGALLY and in droves..WTF does our government expect??
Never forget the state plants egging folk on when these riots start... I knew the far right  would be mentioned on the news horrible what happened in Dublin yesterday... government are to blame
Not so far right…
“Far right” 😂😂😂😂
But the UK government and the EU pushed these policies onto the Irish
I am against looting. Whether it’s Black Lives Matter looting or anyone else. Lots of commenters are hypocrites when they agree with the looters.
Far right 😂.
Far right my bollox
people are frightened and hurting and that is why they are reacting. They have good cause.
Has The Telegraph been hacked by Al-BBCeera? That headline is total Al-BBCeera 💩😂 “Far” now means “completely, absolutely, totally” 👍
It’s NOT misinformation the piece of crap that carried out this attack was a migrant! Start telling the whole story! Journalism is dead DO YOUR BLOODY DUTY and deal in FACTS AND TRUTH
Soutien total au peuple Irlandais 'que l on apprécie beaucoup en France.
if I had to pick a side....
The Telegraph lying and misrepresenting again. Your news cannot be trusted.
I guess Fake News is everywhere and the agenda of saying someone is Far right if they protest the nonsense going on.  Not far right more just fed up.
Man, white people running wild. Can't trust um. Always rioting when they get upset.
Are the mentally I’ll in the world going to drag us all down with them?
This isn't far-right, it's normal Europeans taking their country back. DON'T STOP!
Israhell mosad agent did this terror attack in Ireland .
Stop with your far right rhetoric, anyone who objects to immigrants causing mayhem in Europe is far right, grow up and start reporting the truth. People are awake at the propaganda that the media are trying to portray .  Eyes are wide open.
im with my irish brothers i am from a christian minority community in a muslim country all europeans need to stop acting busy and defend themselves
Attacker is muslim algerian
They are not far right.... just pissed off patriots who have had enough...🇮🇪✝️🇬🇧🇮🇱
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧❤️👍..... 🇮🇪!!!!!
This is what Israel is dealing on daily basis 😡
Far right? BS.
Far right my arse, people are angry and fed up with a government who have ignored them and put their lives and children's lives at risk by allowing undocumented people into the cout
Down with England! Freedom of Ireland and Scotland.
Not far right,  just completely right.
The way they put a emphasis on the way hes algerian like why does it matter 💀
What’s happened to the sweet Dublin I once knew
Far-right??????? The people. The Irish people.stop your 2030 agenda.
si ahora viven entre nosotros como paramos esto? ya veo lo bien que se integran
the schekelstein-bankerbergs  are the ones  who are orchestrating this..               send all those refugees to tel aviv,  let them have their own medicine
Good. Enough of this crap. Time to start revolting if governments wont curb immigration.
Concerning how this happens and the first thing ppl mention is the mans race like why does that even matter 💀
Far left media gone off the scale, sees left as right, journalists mental, unhinged creatures.
Those scenes remind me of the George Floyd Riots in Chicago.
Far right??????? Fed-up citizens more likely!!!! Rar right are the lying media!!!
To the Telegraph stop lying  this is not far right  your manipulation of the truth is unbelievable
Not far right people going aginst a globilist puppet government
horrible title
This has nothing to do with the so called far right, the media is a total disgrace.
What makes it "far right?" Because they're white?
Ireland has no far rightif it had this wouldn't have happened.
As if this doesn’t happen on a daily in the us or uk people need to calm down
Far right?????!
OMG if it was a white male, it would have been plastered all over the news, so we now know which culture loves to use knives in their attacks.
Video posted by the far left media
Im so confused what does him being a algerian have anything to do with this the police clearly stated that even they couldn’t identify his race 😂😂
1.6K Dislikes (to 769 Likes) The people know gaslighting when they see it.
Everyone stating here that Irelands majority supports Palestine  is incorrect, if your were to watch UK news the last few weeks it gives the impression that the majority of the UK supports Palestine, a part from the the left and sinn Fein the majority of people are fed up with the amount of uncontrolled immigration my family is from Ireland and I have relatives over there
EU waking up to the Muslim menace?
Is it any wonder?whilst I don’t condone violence I can fully empathise with these people, they’ve been pushed way too far and they’ve had enough of the powers that be messing on their own from a great height. I’ve seen this coming for a long time now.
It was a terrorist attack and mass stabbing perpetrated by a Muslim fanatic.
Go on the Irish!
Far Right? Just reglar people saying that is enough with crazy immigration policies. Follow Poland!
Far-right? I see the voice of the oppressed - a mostly peaceful protest by the indigenous people. Irish Lives Matter!
"Far-Right" baloney. If the brown  interlopers weren't there it wouldn't have happened. It's the Progressive "Diversity, let's co-exist" do-gooders fault. Ireland for the Irish Now and Forever!
And Ireland put so much effort in their pro palestine stand yet the religion of peace still attack them? the irony.
Despicable,  divisive,  regressive clip title from the telegraph. Pathetic
Multiculturalism at works
Far Right, Far Right, FAR RIGHT!!!! Even the Telegraph is left wing now.  Lets have it right, we hate our lying politicians and media. If our politicians don't stop mass immigration we the people will deal with it.
The media needs to pay for their vile depictions and propaganda against the Irish people here and all Europeans in every other instance.
So much peace
Apparently the attacker was an Algerian immigrant.
Everything is far right with this leftie rag, get your head out of your arses and smell the treachery.
Didn’t they say they will import 1 million refugees from Gaza. I will get my popcorn ready for this summer of love.
We've had enough of the lies! The carnage and violence stems from years of being oppressed and told to look a certain way..  This will ripple throughout the world in time..
Good people of Ireland stand against islamic terror. The Media is loosing their grip and the people are awake
Far right is the accusation?  So people not wanting to be indoctrinated and conquered and forcibly subjected to islam as being far right?  I dont see thar as being far right...i see it as people not wanting to be conquered by islam...its not far right to resist being conquered by islam...screw the prophet.
Media doesn’t like the truth
Drive out the jews flooding your lands with these violent invaders.
Isn't this what the Irish call "legitimate resistance" when it happens to Israelis? Islamics just trying to liberate dar al-harb lands these Irish are occupying. "One Struggle"!
"Far right" - my a.. ! Why won't they say it was an Algerian muslim? ( we know why , don't we!)😢
This is not far right violence. This is the indigenous Irish rightfully standing up for each other and their country. Ireland has been over run and still more pouring in. More main stream media lies.
Far right is this a joke nothing. Far right about this
far right huh? Media is getting desperate to spread misleading information 😂😂😂
Do not attack the garda,it is the media luvvies who are to blame
I wonder why islamist nationalism is never described in the news as far-right. It proves how much Ireland and the UK are on board with terrorism. To me, labelling these riots as far-right in such circumstances is like labelling the Allies as such for bombarding Dresden and the D-Day. Its stupid
Immigration from the Middle East and Africa needs to be stopped.   Hatch Hall on hatch street near the IOE has over 200 illegal Muslim and sub-Saharan Africans being housed in it. A €23,000,000 building once a hotel is being used to house illegal migrants funded by our own govt.
Far left media outlets are complicit in everything that happened today
Why are they protesting?
Oppertunistic looting just like BLM riots!!
Far Right?🤣
finally Europeans are waking up
Word of mouth from bystanders, thats why the protest  happened  so quickly. Now it appears to be an Algerian living in Ireland  over 20 years and has an Irish  passport.
There is no far right problem in Ireland
While I totally disagree with the riots and destruction, it’s in the halfpenny place to three five year olds and a heroic female brave teacher being knifed by an Algerian 50 year old man at lunch time in the centre of Dublin. Full stop, end of. No comments please about emigration or potato famine etc. simply not acceptable given the reality of what happened to these angles.
Globalists call national citizens far right.  This is globalist org.
Why is it, everytime uk citizens kick off , its far right , to blame. Police and the government need to wake up and  start dealing with the far left , who are protesting on the streets, every weekend, shouting , Jhad etc.
shame on u for calling this far right violence .  U R THE PROBLEM .
Welcome to ireland... what an image ...
ZIONISM in action. Here's what happens to a country that speaks up against Israel.
Since when does a small nation like Eire need immigrants??
It was a matter of time. But a country without a right-leaning party can only keep peace so long. I don't condone the actions, but I understand the reason.
I now 100% support anyone the media calls Far Right. I don't even care what they believe any more and never considered myself even remotely "Far Right". but if the media calls them Far Right then it just means that they are probably doing something good.
'far-right' my arse.
They will never Call Hamas a terrorist or far right organization 😂 The irony!
About time the government don't listen to us anyways
So now mooslims are far right? Ok then.
The media are our enemy.
Blame normal people for normal response to a threat NOT FAR RIGHT
It's not far right
Mindless junkies posing as Patriots . This is the highly skilled and highly educated Irish youth the Irish Government is talking about ?
Time to take back our countries
Far right what a joke.Far  right are these criminal politicans letting these evil people onto the country.They should be held to account
The far right is the journalist
Far right my arse english lap dog media clowns.
islamic invaders and others are actually Anti-Assimulation Gangsters who have nothing but Evil intentions against the people no matter where they are. Those who support these Barbaric savages are guilty of Treason.
What is far right?
Why report on this but not the actual stabbings themselves..?! 😡🇮🇪🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Dial be empty tomorrow morning nothing the government do is for our nation or our people. ...
Please don't anyone embarrass themselves by saying its the " far right ".  People who hate the west and our freedom are far right.
Finally Europe is waking up. Stop islamic and African imigration. Stop Zionist organizations trying to wreck chaos, destroy safety and dismantle national identities of european countries.
This was going to explode.  People in inner city dublin have been angry a while.  Looting solves nothing obviously, will the govt stop taking asylum seekers ???
The headline is shocking, “far right”  anybody who questions Ireland open door policy is labelled Far Right, we all knew this was inevitable, it already happened back in Dublin airport back in September, it’s been happening in Sweden for the last 5 years, the crime rate there has soured upwards due to these 3rd world economic men flooding in. Frankly the Irish people are getting fed up of this “Ireland for all” 💩,
If that's "far right" then people need to wake up before is too late as in France and be "far right"
ITS IN NO WAY FAR F'N RIGHT ...THE IRISH PEOPLE ARE ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED AT THE WAY OUR HORRIBLE UNELECTED GOVERNMENT ARE DESTROYING OUR ONCE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE ISLAND....ITS AS SIMPLE AS THAT ...IRISH LIFES MATTER TOO...
The looney left actually want this
No Far Right. Ordinary citizens standing up for themselves. Ireland for the Irish ❤
The far right there looks like the far left in the USA
The media will portray this algerian man as a misunderstood saint
Far right? Is this the new title for concerned people. Leftist attitudes allowed this stabbing to happen.  I hope Britain learns as Dublin did.
The fact that they didn't release any details about the attacker pretty much says everything we need to know.
Hey pssstt.....Telegraph, mainstream media is dead, and your "far right" pony was buried long ago.   We're the media now.
'Far right', my arse!  This is normal, every day people, finally standing up for themselves.
People fighting back not far right
Religion of peace ✌️ always create s tension , disharmony , terrors , crimes in host countries.
Far right ?
It makes my blood boil the narrative of the police and media and their censorship of the truth
The media are disgusting
Far right causing chaos as usual. No change from them.
Ireland seeing now how the US media treats us here too! The anti yt agenda is real!
"Far right!" they're patriots who have had enough!
All I see is mainly peaceful protestors ☺
This is Not far-right. its regular people. Fake headlines is precisely where this violence is coming from
Far right don't think so, ya clowns 🤡🤡🤡
Fake news drain the swamp, pedo
Hell yeah! God bless the Irish!
Media never miss an opportunity to refer to native populations of countries as far right. Another example of the media being one of the main ememies.
Far right must translate as justified
FAR  right hahahjahaha its Ireland FFS THERE IS NO FAR RIGHT how the bullshi--ers try to control the narrative WAY TOO LATE ,check holland
These far right rioters are terrorists. They attacked police, burned the Luas (train), vandalized and looted shops... What part of that is justifiable? Certainly Palestinians would be called terrorists if they did the same thing...
Didnt realise i was far right until now then
Fuvk the telegraph antiquity bye bye mainstream 😊
This is not the far right. This is the Irish people sick of immagrants flooding the country and getting everything for free. Yes the Irish went all over the world but we bloody worked and intergrated into each countries society. Nobody gave us a free house, free education, free health free everything. We have a housing crisis and yet we are housing illegal immagrants before our own and weve had it now
People are waking up!
Far right?
Bit of a stretch calling them far right since they were probably flying Palestine flags and cheering on Hamas last week
I believe that behind this heinous crime is the Zionist intelligence, whose goal is to ignite the Irish street because of its standing on the side of the freedom of Palestine
By “far right” they mean citizens of Ireland who love their country.
When the pandering media call it "far right violence", this tells us all we need to know about the identity of the attacker.
Let me guess its trumps fault
Was it the far right? It looked like ordinary people  who had just been pushed too far to me.
Irish politicians are the cause of this
Kudos to these Irish.
Wow what hard hitting, unbiased reporting 😂😂
Its not far right . Its the lefts fault things like this happen they let unvetted people enter the country and they attack innocent people. How many murders that are not gang related done by irish people.However I don't agree with looting and damaging property its not their fault , its the governments
Far right ??? or just every day people who have had enough of not being heard
WTF! far right ?? ah right it was knife of peace !
I'm wondering as of what Irish people are referring to as an immigrant in this particular scenario considering the amount of hate I see in the comments. I'm from Romania, been living in Ireland for 8 years, work honestly, paid my taxes, gave to charity and all the bells and whistles a good citizen should do and now I feel like crap, wtf
They could easily sink the boats coming over. They are here because our weak, pathetic leaders let them in.
Reported this video for misinformation.
Growing up in Belfast this kind of thing happened a fair bit, no one ever called it "far right" though! 1:20
welp FAR RIGHT are the GOOD GUYS get FOOOKED :)
This shows the Telegraph to be a rotten to the core leftist liar.
I am French and we have the same politics withe the same media ==> 30 immigrants armed with knives attacked a village festival and the media speak of new items
This comment section speaks for itself. The Irish press are a disgrace. The title of this video is ridiculous and everybody knows it.
Far right? ffs....no just Irish people concerned for their families safety.
Why say far right when its just people that want there families to be safe
I wonder if Clare Daly and Mick Wallace are seeing this?
Diversity is our strength. ... not
protect ur country lads, u got all the right 🇮🇪
Irish young people is the real problem... every one know that, absolutely the law needs updates about teenagers
Hello this coup went up, this plot (conspiracy) of any kind was made by the MOSSAD to discredit Hamas, so that Ireland that ranks on the side of Israel, is that Israel say we have a common enemy Islamist terrorism. The bombing occurred after the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador from Ireland three days ago . NEWS: Ireland dismisses Israeli ambassador, and condemns Israel before the International Criminal Court (Israel retaliates) (Israel takes revenge)
Clearly not far right!
Uk media are a disgrace
That "far right" narrative becomes ridiculous and, let's be honest, boring. It's kind of weird to call 90% of population far right😂. "We are all Spartacus"
More lies from the mainsteam media. Why are they far right? I dont support the violence but who says theyre far right? When so called protestors smash the place up in the name of blm etc they dont get called far left. But i suppose everything looks far right when youre far left.
And The Telegraph is to be owned by Muslims soon.
nothing to do with far right, the people have had enough of these illegals, the fight back has begun
Propaganda machine at work again 😂
Far right? Those are Irish people.
Headline not helping.  Name calling is not needed.
Ain’t no far right mate the whole off Dublin was there we have and a enough of our government not listening to the people it was only time untill it boiled over we will stand and fight for our country proud to be Irish🇮🇪💚🙏🏽
I always see doctors, engineers and professors in Parnell, whenever I'm passing by. This is where they drop them off. Garda is truly revealing to the people who has committed the stabbings by desperately trying to hide his identity. A white man would have been fully named, even his pets would be listed immediately.. :D
Disgusting scenes tonight, scumbags claiming to love Ireland while setting it on fire...
Absolutely disgusting calling these brave people far right,for standing up against evil
The only far right are those who had enough so far that's right
Islamp bright
Should've been a peaceful protest, but they've turned to contradiction instead by doing what they say immigrants do. Pathetic.
Far left media spreading lies once again.
FAR RIGHT causes climate change aswell
The irish, whom by the way is a group known to be constantly oppressed and not taken seriously when ills befall them. History repeats itself, and to follow, the upper class is getting mad and slandering them for acting out against inaction and the decisions that led to the problem.
THERE IS NOT A SINGLE COMMENT THAT DOESN'T CALL OUT THE MEDIA'S SPIN ON "FAR RIGHT VIOLENCE" THIS IS WHY THEY REMOVED THE DISLIKES, AND I WOULNT BE SHOCKED IF THE REMOVE THE COMMENTS SOON.
The people who call this far right are our real enemies
As a generally left-leaning person, I'm asking myself if the people from The Telegraph have lost their mind. Take your propaganda and stick it where it belongs.
Boycott the telegraph for that title
Why is it right wing violence it may of been an enraged socialists
The usual negative labelling of people who have had enough of the " peaceful religion ". Meanwhile the hacks who lie for this rag, denegrate them  at every turn, working for their elite rich masters. We will remember your treachery.
Government is fully responsible for their ignorance
DOES ANYONE TAKE ANYNOTICE OF THE NEWSPAPERS
The "Religion of peace" is the problem in every corner of Europe.
Everything is far right now days
I wonder if all those young men who fought in the trenches at the Somme,Passchendaele, Ypres  and later, stormed the beaches at Anzio and Normandy were "far right"?
just watched RTE 9pm news absolutely no mention of the riot & looting. Irish media about as quick to respond as the Gards have been tonight.
STABBER IS ALGERIAN. Just tell the truth, Telegraph
Far right? This is the only way to restore security in our society.
Report all channels like this in YouTube for misleading
That's a scummy title
Okay, as an immigrant, I'm officially scared as hell
Why destroy property?   Did the property have something to do.with this crime😮
The Telegraph are extreme-left anti-European propagandists.
Seems to me that lying treacherous media outlets would be more just targets for protest than the local highstreet. Dublin :  103 Rutnam House Apapa Oshdodi Expressway 27 Tapbot Street 46 Upper Dorset Street  London : 88 Fenchurch Street 111 Buckingham Palace Road 1 London Bridge Street Kings Place 90 York Way 2 Derry Street 22 Old Queen Street 1 John Adam Street
Why attack peoples shops.
far right, more like the telegraph is far stupid.
Not far right the Telegraph is not a place to get news from
Mossad plant. Why now? Why Ireland?
Far left publication
Islam has no place in Ireland
Out!
Why burn and destroy irish peoples livelihood disgusting
The MSM can’t even hide their far left agenda, everyone sees through their lies now.
Bull..not far right..just right so far...
So far, so right.
Any Irish man or woman subscribed to this channel needs to make a choice...ur with us or against us..
'Far right' 😂😂😂
Is the Islamic ☪️ palestine 🇵🇸 march  happening this Saturday in Dublin 🇪🇺
I am not Irish nor do I live in Europe, but things are coming to a head to the point where these Muslim lunatics need to be expelled from Europe. The accusations of racism are nonsensical. The governments of Europe need to remember who they serve. Not the Africans, not the Middle Easterners, not the Asians.
So, riots after brutality against black people are far left?
Far-right? In Dublin? 😂
We're not far right were the was so silent majority not anymore.  Traitorous paper
Far right violence? And what about it puts at that end of the political spectrum?
Disgusting extreme anti white anti irish anti british newspaper.
It's not far right. They need to leave
People say it is wrong to assume all immigrants are dangerous yet these are the same people who assume all Incels are dangerous. Whenever a shooting happens in America they assume it is an incel man, they are hypocrites.
Far-right feck all,  pissed off PUBLIC
Every time people are fed up with the politics ,it's called "far right"
Far right stop making stuff up, typical MSM .
Everyone knows the attacker was Algerian so this is woeful reporting.
So it is zionists trying to mess up with Ireland
FAR- RIGHT ????? JUST RIGHT MEDIA SCUMBAGS..
😂😢
So, people who are NATIVE to their lands, take action against NON natives in their lands and they get labelled 'far right', yet the non natives aren't even Allowed to be criticized normally, let alone when they carry out blatant crimes, murders and the Imams in Mosques are calling for the murders of all Jews and infedels!!!!! Shut All the mosques down with immediate effect and arrest ANYONE openly supporting these acts of terror. Fight Islam with Christianity and Jesus. They cannot win. God bless.
World war 3 Before gta 6 came out wowo lol💀💀💀💀💀💀
Let me guess... mossad operation to turn the Irish on their side because they've been very critical of them lately? Wouldn't be the first false flag they do
Apparently its far right to ge pissed off at a 5 year old being stabbed, i must be as far right as it gets then
Funny how The Telegraph do not waste time saying far-right,  but when a attack they report is from a migrant they do in a way that makes them looks as  accomplices.
Christians & Jews wake up. They are coming for our religion, for our way of life, and for our lives.
Not a mention of this in the bought and paid for Canadian MSM,  gee I wonder why? When did moral decency and integrity become right wing and extremist?
So normal people who are fed up then.....
Reported, xenophobia is not far left or far right, these disgusting p.o.s are just taking advantage of an ugly situation for their own political goals
"Far-right"  Already fake propaganda.
Poland only country in Europe without terrorist attack. I wonder why. 🇵🇱 white and red.
Far right must mean common sense these days..
Whatever Pravda
What kind of journalism the telegraph is?
Ohh..when the moroccan criminal got killed in France the media said the riots call for justice,but when really innocent people almost get killed by a terrorist and they protest it's called "far-right violence"
So - called Far right defending against LEFTIST(STATIST) B.S..
>Hates them  >Behaves like them
Here we go with the ‘la la la far right’ blanket statements
Far right violence or people tired of leftist muslim  immigration policy?
The last straw. The media and governments have failed us.
The term " Far right" is a modern term of abuse. The more undefined a term is the more effective it is because it can be thrown at anybody and for anything.   The minister for justice spent 60 seconds on the actual stabbing on an interview on primetime and 6 mins on calling everyone who protested far right and thugs.   No question there are thugs in dublin tonight but many people in Ireland are sick to their back teeth of these people coming to the country and raping, killing and stabbing innocent people.
The media is infested with voyarists and vermin
Just remember one thing people - if multiculturalism worked like politicians and the muppet media pretended it did, then we wouldn't need visa's or passports to visit foreign countries: would we. Its all been a SCAM.
No excuse for thuggish behaviour and looting.  Protest by all means, but do so peacefully.
Typical statement by far left globalist media.
They are not far right. They are ordinary decent hooligans and looters using what happened earlier in the day to justify their acts of destruction.
The worm is turning and not before fuc.king time, roll on in the UK
Well then the majority of irish people are far right. Irish are sick of thousands of men flooding the country with fake or no documentation.  Enough is enough
Brown colored north African bedouin
With all the war and horrible things happening in the world this is the last thing we need. 😔   My thoughts and prayers go out to anyone hurt by these horrible people. ❤🙏
Ffs i knew its all the far rights fault
Im irish and im ashamed to call.myself irish yes there was a attack we sud be standing together not rioting this is showing the world what we realy are
Twice now in the space of two weeks I have seen, from the Telegraph, this exact same misrepresentation of popular protests, of average citizens as being “far right”.
I knew they'd all it far right once it came out it was someone from Africa or middle east
This is not far right.
That's one paper I won't be buying anymore.
Its not far right to oppose mass immigration.
The Irish don't mess about
Isto é só o início do que está por vir:Europa projecto torre de Babel.
FAR right???? FO!  It is called RIGHT for a reason!!
Just checked - my principal comment has been shadow banned again. I'm to only person who posted more than 10 minutes ago who doesn't have even one like.   The only comments that I'm consistently allowed to make - no matter which YT channel - are ones where I don't express my opinions on the topic at hand!
The republic of no nonsense
Far right?!
Why is it far -right? That’s like calling Palestinian protests far-left
Ah, of course. They're "far right vandals" when the violence doesn't suit your narrative. However, when the violence and destruction DOES suit your narrative, they are simply "protestors". Absolutely laughable.
Seems mostly peaceful
Why loot and destroy local businesses? Looting isn't protesting.....
Thumbs down for the telegraph mislabeling and providing their audience misleading information.. shameful
Shocking violence whole word gone mad
Stop with the lies and propaganda. This is not far right...just like those defending the cenotaph were not far right. We are the majority and we have had enough
This is an outlet that calls itself right wing. So pathetic
Ireland is the most far left country in the EU. These people have had enough of government and media. We are not far right we are just angry.
It’s not far right, it’s people who have had enough of being put last in their own country
What happens if it turns out it's a  Irish man who stabbed a little girl that belongs to the ethnic minority group?
I stand with Irish people
People of Ireland. Keep this up. Get these invaders out of YOUR country.
Disgraceful headline.
*PROUDLY FAR RIGHT IF THIS IS WHAT CONSISTS OF "FAR RIGHT"*
Clickbait journalist turd, no other videos indicate "far-right" except this one. Should rename it to "far too right"
Europe is doomed
People are finally waking up now!!!!
My bollix its far right....can't believe the telegraph would say this rte ,Irish Times propaganda
If your not left your FAR-right every time
Mostly peaceful.
https://youtu.be/kd0e40EBXMI?si=b9GrTsxb0FUXjMOm
NOT THE FAR RIGHT. Just junkie opportunist's
Not far right there just right for being angry there gov allowed this to happen..these migrant vermin but go or be forced to go there will be civil war these vermin are getting housed fed money etc and this is how they repay it’s a disgrace
FAR RIGHT ???? This is what we are dealing with now in the West. No such thing as FAR LEFT EXTREMISM- is there???
We're sick of it
Is it true that now the radical change of government in Holland is understood as the greatest historical error and stupidity of Social Democracy? The Reconquest begins.
I was waiting for the "Far Right" narrative to start. Didn't take long. I wouldn't be surprised if the whole thing (the alleged stabbings and the riots) was planned and orchestrated in order to build the narrative of the "urgent need to prtotect society from the far right". The "far right " being ordinary decent Irish people who oppose being disenfranchised and replaced. Ordinary, decent Irish people who oppose the importation of thousands upon thousands of , undocumented, military aged men from Africa and the middle east and the placement of large numbers of these men in to quiet communities. Ordinary Irish parents who are worried about the safety of their daughters when they are out an about. Of course, new laws will have to be enacted to deal with these "Far right" people. Just wait and see. BTW when I  use the word "orchestrated" I am saying that I am distinctly aware of the possibility that the alleged stabbings did not happen.
far right  😆
What any of this has to do with far-right, get real.
SUPPORT FROM CANADA🇨🇦 TAKE BACK YOUR COUNTRY LADS🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
Our media have clearly lost the plot and are nothing more than agitators and propagandists at this point...shame on the telegraph for this headline that defames rightfully angry people concerned for the welfare and safety of their citizens
They're not far right, they're indigenous people
Falta muy poco para que este escenario se repita en todos los paises de europa y del mundo que estan siendo invadidos por la inmigracion desbordada y peor si los gobiernos no actuan la gente hara lo que halla que hacer por su  cuenta y riesgo
Absolutely outrageous situation
THIS IS ORDINARY PEOPLE REACTING TO THE TERRIBLE ATTACKS BOUGHT ON BY THEIR GOVERMENTS WOKE AGENDA. THEY HAVE HAD ENOUGH. THEY ARE NOT FAR RIGHT EXTREMISTS JUST ORDINARY INNOCENT PEOPLE WHO DESERVE TO LIVE IN A SAFE SOCIETY.
So it begins.
I'm Irish My heart is broken tonight over this I hope Ireland gets the justice we deserve we don't know who has came into our country Ireland is f#cked up right now please God everything will be alright by tomorrow 🇨🇮🙏😭💔
*WE. WERE. NEVER. ASKED.*
Far right? They are concerned citizens who are fed up with the mass immigration, just like us British citizens 👌
The UK stands with Ireland.  🇬🇧
The "Far right" element screams an agenda. The rioting proper are just hooligans. But your average man/woman (old fashioned eh!) In Europe is now being pushed to their limits by the woke/ fringe/ perverted government policies that have been imposed on us to bend over for hordes of economic migrants seeking to exploit us and the associated criminals, rapist, murders, terrorists the flow along with them. It will end in tears, and the rest.
far right? fed up citizens more like it
Sensational headline
Why don’t the police and army arrest these people! Where are the security guards???? Criminals  are documenting themselves committing crimes and a small token police force are sent to control it!!!! What a joke! Where are the military????? Ireland has become refuse for criminals who know they can do what they like!
So many people saying the right thing here. If these views are far right, then there are an awful lot of us! Things are changing everywhere now , with riots in the USA and Sweden, and if Ireland wants to stop these present ones, publish the identity of the perpetrator. That will either stop them or prove people's anger to be justified.
Didn't the far right used to be conservative Catholics.?
Remember folks, when it’s social-Marxists and black supremacists on the streets burning, looting, and murdering it’s nothing more than “fiery but peaceful protests” anything else is far right extremism!
Far right? gtfo with that nonesense.
Not far right.
Time to take action against the far left enablers of terrorists like the Telegraph.
Oooh... Far-R1ght boogeyman again... Looks like typical "fiery, but mostly peaceful" leftard protest, but hey... I don't drink the leftard Koolaid.
Ban Islam. Ban Quran. Deport Muslims.
Far right or ordinary people who have had enough?
How is it far right to finally reach breaking point and deciding the religion of peace has got to go? More countries should follow suit.
So many democrats have Irish roots including the President , hopefully they get the message finally what their policies are doing to the world
Time for the new I.N.L.A against the government of globalism The English are insipid the Irish are not
" far right " lol at these poshies calling every single thing far right
Everything is far right when the telegraph reports an attack ... Little babies are attacked and they probably blame them and the attacker the victim .
"Far Right" is now the label used to describe anybody not fully on board with relentless, unchecked mass immigration, or anybody who thinks a man can't be a woman.
If left does it “peaceful protest”, if the right does it “far right violence”
Far right? Having a laugh or what
English are with our friends the Irish.
Of course The Telegraph says "far right" in the title
What is this far right rubbish
Telegraph shows it's TRUE colours again
We all knew it wouldn't take long for the media hatefilled smear merchants to start with the "Far Right" label against people whos own governments have utterly betrayed their peoples by deliberately importing murderers to our countries, to murder our people.  "Far Right" is the modern "Juden" label of western mainstream media and governments.
Islam is corroding Europe from within. When Europeans realize it, immigrants from Muslim countries will have taken and controlled everything they can take. Western culture and values are under threat, and it is only going to get worse.
I’m scared
Stop saying far right they are more likely far left honestly
The far right were the Canary that proceeded the normal quiet majority exploding because of the stupid and irresponsible behaviour of the far left!
Far right, really? Propagandist
What is with this wave of progressive-liberalism that engulfed the irish government and much of the younger irish generation?
"Far Right"? - This is beginning to sound a little stale now.
Asylum seekers out now
Leftists politicians just bring in their own country, their own home the an enemy, Trojan to ruin their own culture and society for satisfied some trash woke mindset people.  Now, this is consequences of unequal, unfair when it come to government treat their own citizens worse than immigrants. Why let foreign people without respect of home-owner culture, history, society) come to live in your society? The answer only leftist politicians know. But 1 fact, all of them are traitors, betray their own country for their terms and benefit, betray their own ancestors who fought and died for peacful society, not for massive ungrateful , unrespectful immigrants come & destroyed its statue, its culture, its history.
I'm cancelling my Telegraph subscription over your labelling these protesters 'far right'.
People across the world are getting fed up! Go Ireland 🇮🇪
What a stupid statement from the Telegraph, best avoided in future.
Not far right
🤣🤣🤣Far right! London communist clowns🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Far right? People standing up for what IS RIGHT.
Should be pro right, mainstream media pushing there own agendas again
Not far right, just people pissed off with immigrants
Lol, I wonder where all your antisemitic  politicians are right now?  They didn't revel anything about the attacker because they know he is either in the country illegally, or an Anti Western Arab and/or Muslim, most likely a Palestinian.
Stop using far right narrative it’s ordinary citizens fed up with mass immigration and the problem it causes
They are not far right
In 200 years Muslims will claim to be the indigenous people of Ireland and actual Irish people will be labeled colonizers and invaders if they try to take back their land.
The 'far-right' accusations are growing thin
Far right headlines again. People dont fall for this crap anymore its normal people fed up with all this mass immigration. It will only get worse
Remember when Muslim  grooming gangs were just a far right conspiracy theory,  how many victims were they, people are tired of governments allowing anybody to enter their country unchecked and then covering up the damage and true cost
UK lives in a Muslim submarine, Muslim submarine, Muslim submarine
Which far right organisation was it,  telegraph editors.
This looks like  the boiling point of a country that seems to be fed up of all the ¡zI@|\/|  bulls!@#
Far right?  I for one can not wait for the day media outlets like this one feel the wrath of the people that they have been lying to.
People have had enough
Far right my arse
If the government doesn't start putting it citizens first then we will see more than this. I feel Europe is on a knifes edge.
Thanks,
proud of irish people , protect your country
Patriots fight for their country. As an Englishman I stand with the Irish on this. It's our land.
Good on Ireland got a back bone to stand up to this abhorrent invasion let's have it right nothing positive comes from islamic immigration just terror attacks and less opportunities for people born and bred in a area sad about the young girl only five absolutely tragic and shocking how many more sick attacks until more people wake up
Far right 😂
0:43 yes police not Gardaí
The real tragedy here is how the incident will be used by the fascist far right nutters to fuel the hatred of the muslim community in Ireland
Complete lunatic faction, absolutely right officers!! Disgusting drunken drugged up despicable beings, nastiest examples of humans!
Ar the old far right chestnut gets played, what a surprise.
"Far right" in Dublin 😂😂😂😂 there's no such thing. The people, left and right, have had enough
Far right me boll!X boycott telegraph
Far right violence???
The government let them in. They are responsible for the violence.
Far Right my arse
Oh yeah "far right" lol clowns
It's not far right, stop being part of the problem, telegraph. The people have had enough
Untill the people of Ireland are put first, expect more of this. Deport now!
TOMMY ROBINSON HAS SPARKED THE FAR RIGHT
The far right are the only people who could see what mass imigration would do to.our country but the woke left refused to listen.
To Bobby Sands 🍻
The irish have literally  been immigrants in every century, migrating all over the world in masses....how quickly they forget.
The Europeans' time has come. Stand firm against Islam.
Stop calling people far right numtys
Far right my arse. Corrupt msm reporting bullshit.
Everyone who doesn't fit your narrative is labelled as far-right thugs, "emboldened by misinformation", I'd call them patriots.
Civil unrest is bound to come when politicians elected to represent us do not follow through with actiobs the electorate voted for. The UK has far worse to come, but i support the people of Ireland (but not violence), who are standing up for their culture. Vote for change.
The "Far Right" just doing what the leftist do.
What diabolic news reporting , it was an Algerian immigrant , the government are spitting on the grave of Aisling Murphy and anyone else who has fallen to the violence brought on Ireland
Far right? balls, it's just people fed up!
Europe is about fed up with the endless stream of third world people invading our countries with zero intentions to integrate and all the intentions to take over
Losing control world wide
Deport the caliphate!!!!!
This is only acceptable when BLM do it.
Stop the bull. Everyday people and parents are outraged.
Damaging buildings, breaking into shops, burning, fighting police. Yet many are justifying or excusing it- because it’s being done by the group of people they identify with
Far right 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The media are the enemy not the so called far right.
Open boarders will destroy UK. Pro Palestine are terrorists.
The corrupt politicians that allowed all of these illegal immigrants into Europe new that this would happen, make sure every mp is held accountable.
Look at the media trying to manipulate the public that this is far right. It is NOT far right.
Why r they far right,there just stickin up 4 there communities against oversees criminals,ye a joke
Not far right, just people fighting back
Wasent the religion of peace again was it
Says the extreme far left Telegraph!
If the perpetrator was muslim, it would already be framed on the news as a terrorist attack, with his face in front page, but if its not then it explains why nobody knows, he will for sure be called a mentally sick person who needed medication
What happened to "Ireland for all" 😂
This is a Divide & Rule strategy. The Irish should know why this is happening NOW, its all a setup to cause trouble to the peaceful Ireland. A third party is trying to cause mischief. Stay united good people
The tactic of 'labelling' people with perceived 'extremist' names has been established as far back as the middle of the 20th century. That is now around 80 years ago. Those protesting are the tip of a very large iceberg, which is made up of ordinary decent people who have been complaining for a very long time that it is not feasible to continue to allow young male foreigners into a country, who have no allegiance to that country and in a significant number of cases, actively hate the country and it's society. The protesters could be described as the hotheads who are prepared to risk their reputations and freedoms to protest the actions of an increasingly unrepresentative government. They are the ones prepared to take direct action but they are supported by the vast majority of the normal calm people of Ireland. This will not get better by the Garda trying to suppress the protest. It will improve when the government make it clear that the flow of foreigners into the country is to be stopped. The protests will stop when the flow is stopped and action is taken to remove those who have no business or right to be in Ireland. In the meantime it may very well get much worse. It may in fact spread to the UK...
I wonder why Holland has voted to the right. Are they all raisists too or just sick of the Islamic agenda being rammed down our throats.
Can't wait for Ireland to be on the bottom of the list of nice places to go for vacation
They are not far right they are patriots bloody worried about there country and FAMILIES
Enough is enough of the NWO.
weres leo varadkar and his cronies to answer for this ? feathering his nest of that EU money
Hows is it far right their Irish people pissed. Off with this over population of immigrants
Far right ???
THIS IS NOT FAR RIGHT THESE ARE SANE PEOPLE FIGHTING INSANE PEOPLE LET IRELAND BE FREE
Far right really looks like pissed off normal people to me and it’s coming to all the western countries that don’t listen to the people about mass immigration
Not far right just right so far
Lmao @all idiots defending these thugs who are just looking for an excuse to demolish public property. This doesn't help anybody.
Obviously he was dirty stinking seeker
We are more than fed up with this Moorish rabble that has infiltrated all of Europe, enough is enough!
I'm irish and it's not a far right protest scumbags
The Far right calling this far right ohmy
Dont believe mainstream fake news.
I'm sure if it was BLM or some peaceful religion, or some Lefty riot, it would be called a peaceful protest.
This is a long time coming people are sick of unvetted men coming into this country. Teacher killed while running, people stabbed at the airport . Not surprised by this at all.
When Your white it must be far right
Let me correct the title. "The Irish people have began to protest in Dublin, following yet another terrorist attack on the Irish people by foreign immigrants!"
i would like to know if the victims were Christians, Jewish, or Muslim. i think details matter here.
Far right, what a load of bolocks, just young men making a stand.
This Far Right Slur in your title is Tired and Done ! These are Irish people , not Far Right and they have had enough of the insanity of the Far Left !
Time to pay a visit to the papers who call PATRIOTS, far right. Misleading , shxt stirring words.
Oh dear the old  euphamism  for  ordinary people  fed up with  their country being over run  with  people with      no  regard  for the indiginous people         and then there are the  Traitor   politions    who  allowed them in in the first place   ?.     How is a love of your  country and culture   being far right   ?    Its a very   lazy  pathetic   expresion     used by   cultural  marxists   embeded  within the  main stream media   and   all political parties     not to mention the  charities   which  actualy  encourage  the so called asylum  seekers   dash   the  illegal  immigrant  s   and apologise   for islamic  barbarity     Sorry  its just  inacurate   and  pathetic
To the Telegraph : Your comments should have started with : "Because" and not "Despite the Police......
Mainstream MediaSCUM
I wouldn't be surprised if the 🇮🇱 were behind the attack. Red herring is their thing
Far right my arse it's just people pissed of with the system and border jumpers
To the Telegraph : Your comments should have started with : "Because" and not "Despite the Police......
Get your arse around to your parliament and show them what the electorate thinks about their policies.
As an Israeli I call all sides to sit and talk. Maybe give them a part of the land! 😂
5 year old hurt in knife attack     why play it down  what about the others that wear hurt along with her
Lol
Far right my arse.
Algerian
The treasonous p00lice and p00liticians should be scared.....
Why do people say it's the far right when it's just people who have had enough of their country  being over run and the politicians are too weak to do anything about it..we want our country back!!🤨🇬🇧
Far right = the justified reaction of a people pushed to far !!
Absolutely nothing to do with politics
Not far right or any other bullshit....its simply the Irish people sick and tired of the government's bullshit all they care is about themselves look at the money they are on etc but have homeless people its about time
R.I.P.🙏Ashling Murphy, now this, because of their sellout diversity and inclusion tricks.
So now Police will protect identity of a terrorists?  What next? Shooting people to protect terrorists? Europe gonna will burn because of political correctness.
Lol this are the people who support palastine in Celtic vs at Madrid,,
fake news    msm complicit in murder and grooming RIP Ashling Murphy  and the poor punters in sligo ALGERIAN MUSLIM
I am saying the same thing This is NOT "far right" violence.
LOL “far right” my fecking arse
Far right lol. 😂 nope just people have had enough
Far right????in dublin???‘this is about protection,which governments are completely responsible for this,get them out with all those invaders
Wtf peacefuls again!
Lying media
Oh! Look! The thing everyone said was going to happen is happening, Shocked Face Emoji
Irish government gives free houses in city centre which has made it absolutely unsafe for people to visit or live in the centre! The government wants to bank votes by using TAX money to issue free houses and amenities to most of the people who're misusing them.
Just the media blaming "far right" and sympathising the far left
If the police are worried about misinformation they could reveal the attacker's name. His first name would probably do.
Why is it classed as far right?
The fire rises
Far right my arse..ordinary people everywhere have had enough
Leftist media
And it will happen here.
Far right Rollox it’s people trying to defend their home against extremism.
Not far right. Just normal people concerned about their culture.
Stop using the term Far right it's ignorance and no where near the truth,people have woken up to lies told by the msm
Far right is the new liberal by the looks of it
Looks like France
islam is not compatible with western civilization that values freedom, democracy, human rights and progress.
The irony. Irish have migrated all over the world and  caused hovoc. Heck some of the biggest criminals in US and British history are Irish. Not to mention those lovely Kinahan lads exporting their product abroad in 6 or 7 countries. The Irish, a great bunch of lads.
Multiculturalism.....
Far Right?  Or normal people that have had enough?   Sad excuse for a paper
How insulting can the depraved MSM get to call people such things when members of their community are almost murdered by illegal immigrants.  Maybe these corrupt and bought  shills ought to realise we all don't want to live as slaves under a copycat Chinese corporate dictatorship?
Disgusting that the main stream media is focusing more on the backlash than the actual horrific incident or the individual behind the attack.....  Speaks volumes to me....🤔😲
What evidence is there to say they are far right protesters? Sound like Irish people scared about what is happening in their beautiful country. Go the Irish👍👍
Media will try to convice us we're cucks till its last penny
Far right my arseJust concerned citizens,who have been let diwn by their gov.
Voting the right people to change immigration policy is what is needed ..
Better Far-right than far wrong
I hate British media
Anyone defending these thugs should be ashamed! They literally doing same what people in America did couple years ago!
Remember what The Telegraph labelled the people of Ireland revolting against their cowardly government
Far right,  !  the msm narrative.
why cant england or sweden do this? and i wonder why they wont release who the attacker was
Is there an anti immigration party in Ireland?
THEY SURE ARE “FAR RIGHT”!!!!   BECAUSE THEY ARE RIGHT! THEY ARE MORE THAN JUST “RIGHT”! THEY ARE FAR FAR FAR RIGHT!  DEUS VULT
When BLM did the same thing, the media spin it as righteous anger not a violent leftist protests.
F#cking seething!!! what’s the atrocities carried out today and the backlash caused by it anything to do with the far right !!! Those people out on the streets are ordinary people outraged AGAIN by another attack on the innocent !!! Media again making no friends in the midst of another crisis, instead intent on labelling genuine people who dare to voice and act in their concerns, I like millions of others are applauding those people in Ireland tonight, I’m really hoping these events are the start of a movement, THE GREAT FIGHT BACK.
The UK and Irish main stream media are the slime of humanity.
"Oh I couldn't give a damn. About your lies media man"
Why is it the far right all of a sudden ?
I saw Immigrants rioting?   Are they Far Right????
Amazing how quick they are to tag this as "far right" whilst not commenting at all on the stabber.
Again
Far left tabloid backing destroying ireland
Algerian who came to Ireland and given Irish citizenship
Far right?!!! ffs
Ireland doesn't even have a far right. Sinn Fein is far left and all other political parties are centrists. Sometimes a mob is a mob.
Agree..not far right …rightly outraged is what it is..
The religion of peace again
"Far-right violence" This is a  'mostly peaceful ' protest by indigenous people. Irish Lives Matter!
Far right ??? That old chesnut
WTF ? What's with the headline "Far Right"? Most of these people wouldn't even know what that is - not least any of us any more. What an ignorant move. MSM are a bloody disgrace!
Still looks more peaceful than Britain in summer of 2020
Msm bullshit  These are ordinary people who have Had enough of the invaders
Calling a terrorist "a male" is the worst kind of "political patronage" that our politicians have just slapped us in the face with.
Irish are generally friendly to all. They know when they are being taken advantage of as well. It's not anti immigration and that just riles the peotesters. I'm sure many have friends who are foreign . It's anti non vetted release of persons into the general population. This may not even be the case here but regrettably it appears to be irrelevant. It happens and they know that's what I see as obvious.
Misinformation, otherwise previously known as THE TRUTH
Far right ? Have a day off  ffs
My last trip to Dublin about 3 months ago was a eye opener. I asked the Albanian taxi driver why there was stickers on good that i had bought. He said because people just taken then like he does. He also told me its his people's contry now.
Why are Muslims protesting in London not classed as far right when they protest about Jews retaliating to Hamas killing babies in Palestine?
A storm is coming and it will sweep away those that peddle deception in the name of diversity, social engineering and multiculturalism have been foisted upon the UK by globalists supported by a biased and malignant MSM , their experiment has failed and the green shoots of independence are sprouting across the western world .
Far right??  Bloody media establishments stirring, these people are simply angry!!
Most of Europe must be far right now because they all feel this way.
Oh F off calling it far right. Pure propaganda!
Burning busses and looting.  What a bunch of idiots.  I see the Lunatics have come here to comment as well!
Far fkn what it's illegal immigrants flooded in by the government !!!!!!!!
Fat right hahaha the.media have a weird way of talking about the majority
Good show, now the rulers of England can now see and feel, how the people in their streets are being affected by this Barbaric acts.      Nothing is sacred anymore nor are citizens in their own country safe anymore.
Surely it was just hooligans venting their anger and NOT far right
All across the western world the mainstream media are branding countries and there people as far right because people are waking up to the disastrous immigration polices that are importing violence and crime to there communities, country after country is selecting leaders who see the problems. Then there is the housing and these nations healthcare systems plus jobs that cant cope with the influx.
was the guy from Algeria a refugee?
Yes the far left who r mostly in power aren't crimals and liers party gate was only small gathering the world is run by true criminals.. Evil to the core
No, it's not far right. It's people pissed off with immigration and its negative impact on communities. Sick of this media rhetoric used against anyone who opposes woke policies.
Ánimo Dublín. Así es como se defiende la patria
Which ever muslim thought he could spread the fear of Allah in Ireland was wrong. Guess whom it was whom did all the dirty work for the English?
The media are a disgrace.
Always throwing far right lables around
Far right? Hardly. Just ordinary angry citizens.
Far right ?  This is the most interaction the Telegraph have had.
Irish people always strong honour to ireland !!! No snowflakes there !!!!
Pray the Irish attend Resistance-SSPX & C.M.R.I. chapels every Sunday/Holy Day of Obligation. Bishop Giacomo Ballini offers the pre-1951 Missale Romanum & Holy Week.
Its not Far right... protect your country 🇮🇪
At last some people are having a go back these horrible bstds doing so much damage ,to our societies hope all the good and brave people ,get home safe after dishing it out .
Not "far-right".
Enough is enough  the lefty tosser like the telegraph and bbc etc etc label ordinary decent working class far right.
Nice to see a civilised society.
Down vote these media lies about the “far right” protesters
Remember....diversity is our strength.....lol
Wake up!!!!!! Before too late
Far right ! Lazy woke journalists
What is the media doing stating peoples  outrage  at stabbing as far right ?...
I dont agree targeting shops ect that had nothing to do with it,,or even attacking police to a degree,,but the way these leaders are allowing our nations to crumble while we suffer and they live extremely well is sick,,and the fact they wont release the attackers identity proves he is an illegal,,as they know it will kick off if it is an illegal and kick off nation wide as peopke are getting really fed up and angry now..they have to release the identity as they cant withhold public information,,people are rising
It's not far right. How disrespectful
The Telegraph thinks that anyone upset or angry by these stabbings must be a 'far right extremist'. Is it just me or is that the maddest and saddest accusation against normal people? Please dont buy this awful anti Irish rag.😊
No pro Palestinians out tonight then huh   just like Remembrance Day they were all quiet till the English had gone then went in a rampage assaulting the elderly 🤔
Low lifes matter 😮
Didn't see this coming👀🙄🙏
Amazing to see so many people decry peaceful protests as violent over the last few weeks now openly glorifying and justifying  rioting, looting, violence, arson and  destruction of public property.
We are under attack in the west and everytime the NEWS says for unknown reason. Multiple people were stabbed in france by migrants screaming KILL ALL THE WHITES! And what did they report.. "unknown reasons!"
Immigrants burn Paris and it's justified outrage.  A immigrant stabs a little girl and it's far right hate?  What is wrong with your reporting?
‘Far Right’  - so predictable Telegraph!
" IRISH " Joe Biden has refused to control non-White immigration into the U.S.A. SO , learn to " celebrate diversity " Irish people !!
And setting fire to their own city really helps....  The anger might be justified but the arson is moronic and counterproductive  They can demand justice in other ways
FAR RIGHT 😂😂😂 here we go again, being labelled because we care about our country and want the government and police to protect us, and keep us safe, from all the muslim - extremists- illigal- immigrants- flooding the Western countries.
Even the telegraph sinks to this level of prejudice.
Uk stands  with people of Dublin
noticed how anti marxist/communist is far right with these Soros owned shills
As a man in a big city once said. "Part and parcel....."
Ian Paisley is rollin
These people are not far right but the government is far left by allowing third world immigration by the boat load into the small  country
Don’t try sugar coat it Irish people have had enough and this smell government will be ran out mark my words!!
Just say it’s a BLM mostly peaceful protest. They don’t mind it then.
Long life to Ireland
Wow its definitely not terror related , its a stand alone attack but they are 💯 far right 😂😂😂 media is a fooking joke
Rise up Europe. It’s enough! People are angry. Muslims and arabs don’t integrate. Send them back to their country’s. Wake up Europe before is too late. Brave Irish!!! Continue with the fights. And F*ck the media when they say is the far-right!! Is not! Is just people. People had enough!!
they're not far right.. they're just angry.   All journalists are evil
It's because an extreme-far-left supporter attacked people with a knife.
Ireland defend your own!Take your country back!
Far-Right... ahahah... The Telegraph is a Far-Left Russian Propaganda Company  by the look at these titles. Kick the Telegraph out of Europe and send them back to the Soviet Union.
Being called far right is a compliment at this point.
Telegraph, please define “Far right” & how it applies to this situation?
Its not Far right it's RIGHT,
People are getting really angry..
Perhaps it is about time we just started to own the term 'far right', because if being outraged at this makes one 'far right', then I must be 'far right'.
Lol either traditional media has lost the plot completely or they are curropt
Not far right, enough already
Far what lol
So they are angry with the police and attacker - but set a tram and double-decker bus on fire? That makes sense.
FOR 5 MURDERS?!? or injuries. MILLIONS IN DAMAGE, LOADS MORE PROBABLY GOING TO BE INJURED, TRAINS, BUSES AND CARS ON FIRE, GUARDS GETTING BEATEN, AMRY GETTING CALLED IN WITH SHIELDS?!?! WHAT HAS THE COUNTY COME TOO
I am a communist and  I support these lads fighting for their country. Now call me far right. Europeans united against islam and mass immigration 🇪🇸🤝🇨🇮
Disgusting headline.
I think FAR RIGHT now means normal folk
the less white europe will get the more dangerous it will get
MSm Spouts, it's far right. Every time   Shame is on uou !
Wish these angers people would go home Tugs now on the streets of lovely dublin😢
What absolute rubbish....'far right'????..... disgusting MSM headline🤬🤬🤬
Typical rubbish from the main stream media.  These are normal people that have had enough of the lies and  corrupt governments. They are not far right
Stupid Telegraph reporter!
No migrants  No violence
Grew up in London during the IRA bombing campaigns. Never thought id be standing up for Irish patriotism. Go Ireland, get these globalist traitors out
i dont get why people smash up their own town  ,
Get all Muslims out of Europe
The media is angrier at the response to these stabbings than they are at the actual stabbings.
The media have stakes in the manipulation of people.
Let’s see the Muslims protest on the streets of Dublin over this one . Free Palestine my ars.e
Far right..... absolutely fake news..... people are tired of muslims committing crimes and they belive this foreigner did a serious crime without punishment
Why are they far right? They just look like young thugs to me.
Typical lefty newspaper calling people "far-right" for standing up for their fellow citizens , unlike their politicians.
THIS IS THE FAULT OF THE TRAITORS IN GOVERNMENT.  THEY FCUKING DESTROYED US.  AND LOOK WHATS COMING IN TO OUR COUNTRIES EVERY DAY.  CORRUPTION HAS DESTROYED OUR WHOLE WAY OF LIFE
*media trying to discredit something* "Far-right..."
lol it’s not far right! . It’s Irish standing up for the Irish citizens that have been voiced out by politicians allowing a sell out.
The religion of evil strikes again.
Come on Eire.. FIGHT FIGHT.. Never surrender.. Old Irish values..
The Irish government have the blood of a little innocent Irish girl on their hands. They really do and yet they have no shame.
How TF does the media know that these people are all 'Far Right?' Are they wearing stickers on their heads? Or is it just the lazy, go-to mainstream media buzzword to frighten off anyone questioning the utter state of Europe these days?
Far right give ya sell a shake ye idiots
they cant b far rite,no union jaks
This site Israel has a right to defend itself, Also this site when Europeans do the same, far right,
"Far right violence"  I knew it wouldn't be long until the good old media started circulating this narrative.   Absolutely pathetic.
I wonder why the police are inciting the vandals to burn police vehicles.... They drove the vehicles into the centre of Dublin and abandoned them.
Ooh, what a surprise, not one person labelling them 'THUGS, CRIMINALS, LOOTERS AND RIOTERS, 🤔Uhmmmm?
Where is the evidence that these are far right ? I think they will be normal Irish people who have had more than enough
Nothing ""Far-Right"" about any of this !!!!
Get in more asylum
the police warned of misinformation yet here we are the Telegraph spreading misinformation
It’s NOT “far right!” Just right so far. Protect your families and your country.
close all mosques deport all muslims
its now "far right" to be angry about a 5 year old being stabbed
KEEP IMPORTING MUSLIMS
far left extremist policies have caused this .
The telegraph is a disgrace and we will not forget
They think that naming them rar right will stop 100000 Irishmen drom making a stand.  That's what they're really afraid of. The question is how do they expect the people not to revolt against foreign aggressive ideology?
Sorry who is killing who now?
Diversity is a strength, like hell it is....
Nothing far right about this.
Where are all the Free Palestine lot?
100% not far-right people have had enough of the migrants.
Why is it always far right? Perhaps people have had enough?
They’re not far right,they’ve just been pushed too far ,and it’s not rumour or guesswork that the assailant is an Algerian Muslim but that doesn’t fit with the Guardians programme
Let me guess,Something to do with the religion of peace??
NOT FAR RIGHT !!!!!
Shame on inmigrants
Here we go again the lying Telegraph painting everyone as FAR RIGHT!!!!. Just because people stand up to what's not right doesn't male them all FAR RIGHT,  absolute tossers.
“Far Right”??……….Just right!!!
typical patsy torygraph, hide from the facts and smear angry people who have justifiable criticism of unsustainable out of control  imiigration as "far right" Its ignorant and lazy
Seems the Telegraph are "Far Wrong" yet again. Clowns.
Culturas incompatibles con la sociedad europea. Deportaciones masivas lo antes posible. Todo mi respeto por Irlanda.
People have had enough.  This will send a message back to governments that there is only so much tolerance people have. It's time for governments to do what is right and protect their citizens.
And this why the DT is dead  No circulation figures since 2019. 80% down since the 1980s. JOKE PAPER
Anti immigration is far right? Ladies and gentlemen I’m happy to and proud to announce myself publicly as a a member of the far right.
Politicians sleeping like Babies Lets change that
AN ALGERIAN MAN WAS THE OFFENDER.  The Telegraph is "far-left"
Extreme Left, more like
far-right in Ireland ... sounds unreal
Not right wing and don’t forget Ireland fought 800yrs to get rid of imposters leave us alone 💚
I wonder how detailed the reporting will be. If the press doesn't mention the background of the stabber, there might be violence anyway, every time there will be an incident like this. If the police and media come out with the suspects identity, there might be less frustration of the public about attempts to cover up the real circumstances.
ITS NOT FAR RIGHT, ITS PEOPLE HAD ENOUGH
The establishment hate ordinary people and the Telegraph is part of the establishment.
The attacker was an Arab asylum seeker
Why is it always far right, its just locals who have had enough
By this logic. BLM riots were far right???
These people are not FAR RIGHT ... they are just normal citizens brassed off with their politicians pushing an agenda that they  never voted for !
quick to lable them far right, not so quick to call out the algerian
Not far right just the average Irish citizen who has had enough of the invasion and its consequences.
Far right?
We are indigenous white Europeans, we are native to Europe. We had nothing to do with imperialism from 200 years ago, yet our governments are traitors to us! Our governments are trying to population replace us and they import these people to stab, r£pe and kill us.
Fu*k off Telegraph it's not far right it's the mainstream masses of the Irish people....they are united on all sides against the systematic destruction of their own country by this deliberate and illegal immigration agenda. This is exactly what the globalists have wanted and the politicians, police and media are all doing their dirty work for them.
Far right. My arse.
Why "Far Right" , just people fed up of not being listend to.
Its Government buildings they should be outside. They' re the people responsible. Asylum seeking is a multi billion dollar industry Absolutely sick of it. No documents, no rights, end of
These are NOT far right. These are everday people fed up with the b#ll sh%t!!!
Not far right just people angry with traitor politicians.
Far right 😂😂 brainwashed news outlets.. and they wonder why we don’t want any refugees let in dirt bags
Why is far right when it's just normal people just p*ssed off the way we're been treated as 2nd class citizens in our own country the only people that are far right are our government spinless feckers no b🏈lls between them & it's not hard to see why as they are bought by the WEF. ✌️🤬☘️🇮🇪
Seems quite sensible. Globalist Telegraph at it again - accept unlimited immigrants plebs!
The world needs to stand against this radical Islam! #NinthCrusade!!
This is angry parents.
Meanwhile, at that time, people in Hungary and Poland, which do not accept fake refugees and illegal immigrants, were enjoying a peaceful life.
Latest word is the attacker was Algerian.
So the blm riots were far left then i take it, oh thats right they weren't 😂
Patriots not far right
Far right? No, just ordinary folk enraged by what is happening.
And the Irish gov will blame it on racists and the far right dump Islam out of your country along with Sein fein
"Far-right"  - it's bunch of lads in tracksuits out to cause a bit of trouble
There's not a lot of " far right" in Britain and Ireland. People are angry their cities are being destroyed by immigration. These are just normal working class people. I doubt more than a handful has extreme views.
The memo has gone out to the MSM to call them far right and they dutifully follow....
This is not far right this is the people saying no to the invaders.
if the Irish people dont like it they can migrate to somewhere else. Irish dont own Ireland.
It's NOT far right, it's just RIGHT! It's NOT anti immigration, it's fighting for the right to exist and thrive in your own country and not constantly pandering to people who have no intention of integration or having any tolerance of the indigenous population.
They are only citizens defending their country.
A joke, anyone who doesn’t agree with the crap is branded far right
Who cares if it's "far-right"
Misinformation, are they kidding!!!a bloody Muslims again!!!
Of course the "far right", "anti-immigration" protesters are violent, but not the one person who caused this chaos, right? Media like yours are also responsible for this...
How does the UK Telegraph associate north Dublin working class protesters with the far right ?  The mind just boggles at this surreal so-called journalism .
Sorry, media.  Calling things "far-right" doesn't work anymore.  People are wising up to your mendacious bile.
Not 'far-right'!  Just right to show their anger!
They're not far right just right and angry.
STOP ISLAM , MUSLIMS GO HOME
How are these people far right. Please explain
Far right? How do they know?
50 year old Algerian man already confirmed hours ago on gript media
☪️ancer of the world.
It's not far right rubbish gutter press again
Let's face it there can be only one reason why the police haven't revealed anything about the attacker.
Far right?? What sort of journalism and headline is this! SHAME ON THE TELEGRAPH.
Drop the Far Right gaslighting
" Far Right Violence " ????????????
NOT FAR RIGHT, RIGHT SO FAR
Far Right? Piss off Telegraph.
Far right my 🏐🏐 UK government again to blame but no they well blame everyone else 🤡🤡🤡
Why is it far right? I see no sign of that. Just angry locals, fed up with the horror and the violence
This is NOT "far right" violence. People are justifiably angry with the police who LIED and said this was not a terror attack.
Far right is so right...ur headlines suck.
Far right . No just betrayed by government police . Left wing bullshittery.  And msm all traitors to their own .
Not sure how the Telegraph can dress this up as a problem with the Irish
Far right ? Left wing fascist propaganda from the Marxist media. It’s just ordinary irish fed up having to live in fear of being attacked by migrant males coming from third world countries.
Far right???
Not far right. Just Right.
The Irish government called protesters far right when it happened initially a year ago. Then it spread to the towns, villages and rural areas and they stopped when they realised they couldn't call the entire country far right
Describing all involved in the protest as FAR RIGHT is misinformation...............
They are not far right, they are just right
Far right?
Far right me bollix
CORRECTION:  They are NOT "far right", simply Irish people wanting THEIR country back!!
Looks like a largely peaceful protest to me. lol
Native Irish people taking their country back from INVADERS and their own not so patriotic Government, is not far right!
Far right? Is it not just  ordinary people sick of idiot policies that are destroying western societies
Dont insult the irish they concerned citizens
this will blow up in their face  ( irish goverment )  irish people will not take it anymore i am willing  to bet on it..things will just get out of hand ,,and i dont blame the irish peole at all.. it was a terror attack simple as that ..stand alone attack ..still a terror attack ffs..police on the attackers side it seems..
All going to plan...
Europe has had enough off lefty liberals  , letting millions off migrants in ,
The world is erupting and out of the ashes will arise the new world order..
We have more in common with  martia ns than Muslims
Far right? Anyone not a leftwing nutcase.
Far right is misused to refer to anything that's straight, Christian and white.
: the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political, or cultural group  Miriam Webster dictionary definition of Genocide.
It's outrageous that Ireland is being repaid in this manner. (if this is a migrant related incident. But, they're have been many nowadays) Ireland welcomed many migrants and gave them a life that they could never have in their own country. But, a good percentage have no gratitude or respect for the country or the people where they're now living. Nor ever will.
Far Right ❌ Absolutely Right ✅
No telegraph poles were injured in the making of this right so far protest...
Hmm, can anyone confirm a young girl was Intentionally attacked with a knife? Unless this is true the title is misinformation?
Far right,no one believes a word MSM say
finally the Irish people are waking up
So it's far right to take a stand for your country now...I hate the media
Far Right  Total bullshit media news again TELL THE TRUTH  The Irish should take their country back and so should the UK break this poisonous agenda GET THEM OUT.
When are MSM going to stop using the far right as an excuse.
Typical MSM just people who have not been listened too. 🇮🇪❤️🙏🏻🙏🏻
They are far right anti immigration rioters but nothing about the attacker ? No . They are sensible natives population trying to fight a government’s blind eye fueled by this morally corrupt media .
Bloody goverments I blame😡😡
The Muslims are about to take over. too bad EU is still sleeping on their nose..
Far Right ??  OK Telegraph ya right
Not far right, enraged people, the sky news propagandists
Not far right just right so far  Leo varadker Simon coveney shin Fein roderic o Gorman all bringing them in while thousands of indigenous Irish people lie in tents homeless tonight don't come to Ireland
Henry Kissinger said muslims and christians cannot live in peace
There's nothing far right about getting sick of uninvited foreigners coming in, kicking the locals around, and siphoning nations dry while in return they make the locals their victims
There is no far right there is people fighting for thier lands, a government which leaves it's streets full of it's own people and reserves homes and hotels for criminals will only bring about anger and devision, a title like that is just an easy stamp far right blatantly brushing off people's valid opinions and concerns, the riots are a result of that very thing a large portion of irish citizen's have a right for thier issues to be addressed not continuesly stamped and labelled as a far right group ect nonsense.the telegraph another privileged office of people who's world and daily life are protected and kept distant from the effects of mass unchecked imagration into are under privileged parts of Dublin City.
I’m sure it was another mohhhamed because allah said to to it
Not far right, the assailant was of Algerian nationality, a 99% Islamic country.   The pseudo authorities have put the native Irish people at risk by admitting large numbers of dangerous foreign men brainwashed with a political weapon (Islam is not a religion, it's an ideological weapon used to convert ordinary men into conquistadors of foreign nations).
The Telegraph could do with better headline writers.
Ah yes, the organized, ever present, malicious and unforgivable "far-right" protesters. Who needs non-bias reporting eh?
Far right 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Europe time to stand up all together against unwanted aggressive immigration. Deport them and close the borders. NOW!
so from the title we can conclude the left doesn't get upset about these kind of attacks
Ordinary people fed up with elites imposing immigrants on Irish people.  This is your future Ireland.
Far right?  No, angry Irish.
MSM mince
Why "far right" ? ,  . . . . . . . . . . . . .                   oh for the narrative.
It's not far right they wouldn't listin to the people martin did this
they have him in custody..yet will not reveal his identity..mmmm
Who care if far right
Why is it far right when the people want justice !!??
It's Not Far Right........
How is it 'far-right' to object to a five-year old being attacked by some evil person?
Bravo !  nous devons faire pareil en France !
NOT THE FAR RIGHT, Just outraged and betrayed ordinary Irish people.
where is the evidence its the Far Right
Down vote video !  We are standing up !!!!!!
A Muslim attack
Why is it far right violence always the agenda of tje left.More frustration at the way mass immigration is destroying irish culture & society.
"Far Right"?. From The Toiletgraph.
" far right " typical telegraph " reporting ".
We don't have a far-right in Ireland.
Normal people pushed to the edge.  This is the far right?
Far right my arse just riiight
This is what happens when governments betray their own folk.
We are now the "indigenous people" of Ireland.These are ordinary Dubs,not right wing whatever the hell that means.
Young Irish men,  Take Your Country Back. Chase them back from where they came
It sounds like s terror atfack on the irish public but im.sure the looney left will protect the animal he has had a hsrd life blarblarblar usual crap
Congrats on the world's most laughable police uniform, Ireland. And as for your demented govt...
Looks like they had their very own intifada
Not Far Right. Justified. The authorities have put people at risk.
Anything to the right of stalin is considered far right to the far leftist loons.
Far correct!
Far right?
Shove your far right... Disgusting journalists.
"Far Right"? Is the Telegraph captured by  Neo Marxism? Or stupidity?
who wouldent riot?
The natives are becoming restless.
Look more like something the left would do.
It's not far right, just normal people fed up with what's going on in Europe. If far right was in charge we wouldn't be where we are...
Dead is now seriously hurt. Right. Just trying to keep pace with modern journalism.
Франция
Rest in peace
“far right” means angry people in MSM speak. They’re angry, normal Irish people for the most part…it’s disgusting how MSM smear anyone who doesn’t like mass immigration. Shameful title!
So, the ever socialist government of Ireland buys into the whole diversity is our strength bit, imports millions of culturally incompatible people from different parts of the world, they behave accordingly (no fault of theirs, they're just being who they are), and now people are pissed. Yes, very much "Far-right."
