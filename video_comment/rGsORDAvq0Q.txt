He passed in 51??💀💀💀
For those who don’t understand: On the 3rd guy, he got a 69. The reason why everyone went crazy is because during COVID, there was a trend called “69”. Just like “67”, a lot of people said it. Idk if this is why but I feel like it’s the most accurate reason
I am the class nerd 😭😭😭😭😭
that is not true my score 1,000,000,000
WTF BRO I GOT ON MY TEST 10000📌😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

U shouldn't have put 6777
My class also have that guy
Today was my maths exam I knew all the questions but i missed 20 mark questions cause the paper was so long and time consuming. I am happy that I will pass I think I will score 60 out of 100 but I am happy as we are backbenchers my friends also did well. but my parents will cook me 😂😂 Especially my father ,my mother understands me but my dad He will beat me to death! I face this only on result declaration day it was half yearly
I once had gotten 100% on my maths exam but still begged my teacher for more marks
no one understands the pressure to always revive top marks, let alone perfect marks,  we put so much of our energy and effort and social life into our studies, and even when fall short by 1-2 marks, it hurts so bad
Class Nerd ❌ Class Nerd with strict Asian parents ✔
My bestie is the sensitive nerd but in also a nerd I don't cry unless I get under 70😂
panis kau mga lineup 5  Yun pala 99 sa inyo
Bien
WTF
That’s me😅
I am your subscriber
what so sad about of 99
the "yeet" got me dying💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The one score needed is very very VERY important for class nerd's as his mom tells her to get 100% score every time but that one mark..is what she worked for
I know that feeling…I’ve just experience it this year….
In my class a kid scored 50/50 in math and when I checked her paper and mam marked the last question write while it was wrong the worst part is it was a 5 mark question if she got it wrong i would have been class topper with 49.5/50
Arab parents: WHY DID U SCORE 100 UR SUPPOSED TO SCORE 101!
What is the name of this movie
Guys if you dont know let me explain if the number is much up is thinks is not good she did bad if you guys did good if you have scored 1 is the best core because the 1 is the first number best then is this this is a class idiot❤❤❤pls  likes😂❤😂
i got the score, rollin
Bruh I had someone in math and the max score was 120 and he got a 75/120 and yelled no but I got a lower I told him to be grateful
I understood that's the topper when I saw someone is sobbing over marks.🤣
It’s actually even worse if you get 99.5 and 49.5 to be honest
😅😅😅
That is   how you identify a Asian child
losing 1 or 2 marks is really sad cause u just missed the opportunity to get a perfect score. And all the hard work u did for that 1 mark to go. For people that don't understand it's like getting 2nd place in a race. Which is losing 1st place.
99   😭
Bro i think the female nerd is a middle kid because middle kids when they get 99? Punished? IDK let me find out
I'm the class nerd
I mean a I am a class topper but it's not that serious as well my dad is completely chill he just says good job or if I get a bad score he just says you'll never need this in real life . Mom on the other hand not so chill. Though 90-100 for me is great as usual. 80-90 is that's nice but I'll just try a bit more. But 60-79 OH SHIT MOM'S GONNA KILL ME !!! HELPPP.
She is me😂
I get the score of the nerd one but i become so happy about it so im a topper
Last one time India song 😁
The 69 🌚
If he's the nerd then why he is crying over 99 score
That background music " Heeeee hahaha Ahahahahaaaaaa"
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Literally me trying to make my friends jealous
Those who came to cmnts after noticing "THE SCORE" 👁️🌚👽
In 99 marks your good don't cry now!
Wow your intelligent!
I think WTH means what the hell. If Iam correct comment me yesif I am wrong say no
Some people just don't understand it. It hurts like hell. And I know the feeling as I have went through it.
They really work hard for the top score so i do understand why they feel sad😄 Their mentality is not same like other students
Every time I skip accidently it is your vedio
They called me dirty minded in 200000000000 language  For those who don't know  69 a gali
I am that class nerd🙄
Im that one
Such a drama queen😂
I got a7😢

Class nerd in different countries  Vs Philippines
اخری دوست من هست😂
You don't understand our parents, the beatings, the shame, You don't

Your happiness depends on how much you tried
Once in 3rd grade i thought i scored 45/50 then i cried bc i studied for 16 hours one day 8 reality i got 50
😂😂😂
Me too 😅😅😅
My friend laya has 25 out of 24 but she is looking on others paper to get full marks 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
OMG
69 💀
That is what not feel when they don't get 100 how did they get 99 what the f***
like me
One time I got a History result I got 8/10 and he said that's was bad 😢
It's because we nerds try so hard to get 100. And that's why we can't even lose one mark. It feels like you tried so hard for nothing.  You might get that feeling when you lose a game even though you practiced again and again and used all your strategies.
Poppyplaytime chapter namaste namaste namaste namaste namaste namaste namaste namaste namaste namaste I have something in my pain namaste I have survival of math 🧮 😢 to

When you continuously score good everyone including your parent and teacher except you to be perfect and each number mean a lot to them because they have got scolded for hours for that 1 number
The fact that no one is mentioning the 69 score. Iykyk
Huh
I am not a nerd but I am a class topper I don't study I am lazy so I only get 3. 60
❤
I didn't expect this from this channel...
Starting : I passed Ending : Indian Background Music😂

😊😊😊😊😮😮😮😮😅 8 King 🤴
Class nerd should be named to the Asian kid
999k likes is crazy
no
That one girl in our class got 450 out og 500 and score 80 above in all subjects but cry in the end of the class and create over scene
Squid game fans:"such a buetiful number 69!"
This reminds me of that one video from JianHao Tan, where JianHao was happy about a 51 and Denise was depressed after (you guessed it) A 99.5.
unpas
And the person who just studied sincerly for an hour scored 89
that girl probably has an Asian mom and thats why she sad bc Asian parents want there children to be the best with 100 score
I Indian song at last😂😂
But why 69 😂
Wht is 69?
😢😅😊😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
In this scenario I'm the one who scored 99😅😂
That means i am a nerd without glasses 💀
Don’t throw her she might have a mom who wants her to only get a 100 present
I got 78/80 just 2 marks😭🤧
Didnt study and got a 92 🤷‍♂️🥱
Don't sit them together
You never understand that pain.She lost that one mark even after working her butt off. And that hurts really bad
What a low passing score😢
Only a class nerd like me can feel the pain
In Canada, we need 60 to pass
Score 69 is wild even he says "The score"
Girl literally every one got lower scores and your crying over a 99 grow up your not the main character a 99 is just one mark away from a 100 so pls stop acting like a little baby fresh out of your mothers womb pls stop overreacting
You don't know how hard it is for toppers like me to get full marks we keep studying all day long just to get each mark and then the backbenchers make fun of us and call us pick me for crying over one mark😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
My exams are tmrow (pls wish me luck)
The amazing moment when the background music at last just 🤌💖
Song is sooo good👍 🇮🇳 this is Indian song yeaa
I got 39
I cried in class cuz my math got 94

Nah being the topper+strict parents (having 99 not full mark) Is the worst thing ever
VQ

Me getting an F: oh no big deal David getting A-: this is the worst day ever im gonna cry😢

As a scorer of 2nd rank in class I can understand why class toppers are crying it’s because of the parents forcing their child to study harder if they don’t they can get different type of punishment even hitting them with broom 😢😢
I really hate that nerd type of students
Really It is me 😅
CHAT, IM THAT CLASS NERD
In my country we our marks to be 87 to pass😭😭
OMG 😱
So sad for the nerd😢
But the score without the essay was a 69 and I literally started crying when I found out I scored a 80 with the essay then I was like oh😂😂
Bro I remember in third grade I scored a 39😢 joking😂😂
It’s so annoying and even painful when someone gets a high mark and say they did bad when I’m sitting there with a low score
99½ would have hurted even bad
That last song win my hearr😊
This is me 😂
I understand it😢😢

I actually get real nice marks in mostly all my exams but it ain't due to pressure or anything, in fact my parents say that it's fine to get low marks, but somehow that never happens. They tell me to work hard, if I have worked hard, the result won't matter. :)
The score?!

Great
When you fail just that one question.😢😢😢
The cry got meeeee 😂 And who noticed  the dhadkan BGM in the end?
Bro I’m again being dirty minded why did you score “69”
Bro. Toppers crying over losing a single mark can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the intense pressure and expectations they face, a strong sense of identity tied to academic success, and the fear of failure or disappointing others.  Here's a more detailed breakdown: High Expectations: Toppers often experience significant pressure from parents, teachers, peers, and even themselves to maintain a high level of academic performance. This pressure can create a feeling that every mark lost is a personal failure or a deviation from their expected path.  Identity and Self-Worth: For some, academic success becomes a central part of their identity and self-worth. Losing even a single mark can trigger feelings of inadequacy or failure, as it can be perceived as a threat to their overall sense of self.  Fear of Disappointment: Toppers may worry about disappointing their parents, teachers, or other people in their lives if they don't maintain their high academic standing. The fear of not meeting expectations can lead to emotional distress when they experience a drop in marks.  Overwhelm and Stress: The constant pressure to perform well can lead to overwhelm and stress, making toppers more susceptible to emotional reactions, including crying, when they experience a setback.  Perfectionism: Some toppers may be perfectionists, striving for absolute accuracy in their studies and exams. Losing a single mark can feel like a significant deviation from their goal of perfection, leading to frustration and emotional distress.  Social Factors: The way that toppers are often treated and perceived in their social circles can also contribute to their emotional reactions. They may experience jealousy, pressure to maintain their status, or even feel isolated due to their academic success.  It's important to remember that while these feelings may seem extreme, they are a natural reaction to the intense pressure and expectations that many toppers experience. It's also important to acknowledge that emotional reactions can vary from person to person, and some may be more prone to emotional outbursts than others.
If you don’t understand bc her parent wanted 100 percent bc if didn’t, it will be grounded ig. Idk if I’m right or no

Broo 69 hits hard 🌚💀
the nerd is me tbh
Some scored less because that's what they studied nd that is their potential! But after studying damn hard and knowing you have the potential but still lost the perfect rank cuz of 1 damn mark!! Fucking hurts
😂😂😂😂
Once I scored a 93% on my maths test and guess what my parents said?       "Not bad"        😭

When you study day at night without a rest, even if you get a 99.5, you'll cry. It is misunderstood for being a nerd but all they are trying to do secure their future, I takes a lot of dedication.

2 words: Asian parents
You don't understand....We are sorry that we didn't get what we deserved for our work...

The straight-A student syndrome

See the score of 69
I got 69 for english when i was p4
She's crying bc she has asain parent
Maybe its because of their parents
Am I the only one that thinks 100% is not high enough
Maturity is realising that it's not funny because someone who studied so hard for the exam knows the real pain of silly mistakes which make them feel worthless even if they did great 😮‍💨🙂🥲 PEOPLE CAN NEVER UNDERSTAND THE PAIN OF GETTING 1 MARK LESS THAN FULL SCORE.   Btw it's me......

Bro that's so realllly
Wtf😂
David is nauthy 😂
Are you kidding me??? You got 99 man
Seriously when i bring that nerd score i get a car whatever you say
Its because when they study all day not getting distracted is reeallly hard like im an average scorer when there is exam i stud for like 1 month but distracted i mean only 2 or 1 hour a day but nerds study not distracted for the whole month or even more so they exept full marks, each mark is important for them
"You don't get it I did so bad I scored 99% 💀☠️
Thats the karma for the nerd who got 99
Thats me when im in class when i go home i get grounded and beaten
The reason she is sad about scoring 99 is because of strict parents
Bro what is the joke with 69

Everyone thinks they're the best but it's isn't, the nerd thinks its the worst but its the best,
As a school nerd I can confidently say that I got 92 on a subject and was cool with it

0-79 is the worst!!!!!!😭😭😭😭😭...but 80-100 is the best!!!!!!😊😊😊❤❤❤❤❤❤
I just had a real-life experience that perfectly matches this joke. In a job interview for an auditing position, they asked me to talk about a “failed project” and what I learned from it. I seriously reflected on a group assignment where I didn’t coordinate well as the leader. I was super serious, analyzing everything that went wrong. At the end, I explained that because of that project, I got an A- instead of an A. The manager was typing notes seriously, but when he heard “A-,” he literally burst out laughing!  It was so funny because I was being 100% sincere — I genuinely treated A- as a failure to learn from.  I guess that’s what happens when you grow up with Asian standards. Even A- feels like a disaster worth analyzing!
69💀☠️🌚🌚
Yall Just don't get the feeling it's pain when u get a 98 or a 99 but if 91-97is fine
Teachers pet 😂

When I didn’t study for my English test I somehow got everything correct
The Indian music in the background!!😂😂😂❤❤❤

For those  who don't know they cry and think they did bad because of how much effort goes into the test as an example no sleep so stressed they cry and many more things and some times there parents scold them or get mad at them so even though they were one point of they still cry because of the pressure so if you see anyone like this dont make fun of them just tell them its ok and try to be nice to them please and thanks you!!!  Ps i hope yall enjoyed  this pls like my fingers hurt lol😂 and yes i liked my own comment 😅
That girl is always me 😅😂.  I am sorry my classmates 😂❤.

Actually for what they are crying is their hardwork they study all day and night too staying awake and if the get bad marks their parents are gonna beat them or insult them 😔
Bro I am the class clown and I got 69 marks for my English test 😂😂😂
Class nerd ❌ Asian student ✅
Me be like Get out!!!
I thought it was gonna be asian
Lucky I need 60% at least to pas
As soon as bro heard 99 he didn’t care for her at all
69🌚🌚🌚
Be like
Toper Versus Backbencher
When I only got one mistake I feel I'm bad and my other classmates are Soo happy when there score is 1-100🤦🤦
Tbh i don't understand how people fail exams in my school you have to score below a 40 to fail
Wha- i got 100 in exam cuz im grade 1 💀☠️
Same thing happens to me every test for 4 years straight so far
I remember when this happened to me I wept buckets, whereas most of my class mates were celebrating thr 70 and 69 most of them got but i got a 98 and i was crying seriously 😂😢
That’s not the smart kid that’s just the aisan kid
That is literally me when I scored 84 in maths and saying last goodbyes to my friends
That’s my friend when she has a 2 I’m like bro if u don’t stop crying I’ll kick ur ass like I get barely a 3—2
I don’t study for exams and still pass all!
Happiness is a state of mind

I understand the feeling..Because I'm always the top in class in every subject, when someone broke my record or get more scores than me I'm probably crying.

“The score” is just crazy
Just one number needs
Bruh when i see 69 i go like sixty niiiiiiineeee?!?!?!?!?!?😂(Beacuse im a gd player)

I think they just have Asian parents
i am very proud of myself when i passed from 1 mark
Win 🤓 get 99:😭😭

Me crying for the one mark even when I topped the whole class in 3 subjects😅
Bro I’m the last one
Like me😢
In my school the passing score is 75 but if you get that you don’t get an award😢😢😢
Its me😭😭👍
جصب
غلتابنت
The real reason could be they’re forced. Their parents try and make them perfect. Every mistake they make their parent judge them.
Like I don’t get it!?!?!??  There’s this girl in my class *she’s a topper*  She always scores good grades,then one day we were doing a simple little harmless test,in class and the class kinda got lower then 17/20 but this girl got 18/20 and she started to cry she said “I’m so bad I hate my score” like if I was her I would have been happy like are her parents that strict?!?!? Like girl you should be at least grateful you got a good score and even she’s a topper so like wth? This does not make sense,some kids are sensitive about there grades🤨
I swear I’m the nerd I get 19/20 and I cry😂
Bro. The one score was hard work
😂😂😂😂😂
omg
Me is100
You are chines
Asian

I love it but they study soooooooo hard all year and after all 5he the pressure and hardwork they lose 1 mark breaks their heart Its like a cricket team it practices all year and because of all the pressure of family friends and fans they lose by one run😢😢
WTH

You know.. As a nerd, this is true.. Because if you have Asian parents, you know what will happen 😭
i cried when i got 89 because my dad said he kill me if i got below 90 and he did even tho it was 1 mark
Bro I'm an nerd too

😂😂
The nerdy be like I got 99 it so bad score 😂😂😅😅
I don't need to worry result of the exam
Bro the nerd is true we have the same in my class
Frrr
😂😂😂
I'm the one that doesn't study and gets good grades Like I didn't even know there were exams that day😬😬😬 I guess I just got lucky
She was sad because the one mark, she work so hard to got 100 but teacher got him a 99 mark😢
theres always that one guy:
There is always such nerd in every class
Asian kid gets 99.mom:😡😤.it was the highest.mom:😊😍
The class nerd probably has Asian parents
Hey I m not a nerd but I cry because I wanna make my mom happy
I scored 99 😂😂
I am the 4th type😅
i just got 2/15on my summative test am i cooked?
More like asian kid-
My 99%❤️
WTH
Im like basically all of it 😂😂😂
Soo true
99 marks best score ever class
50? 61? 69? Is it a percent?
nah i used to sit with the nerd and she gat a. 98 and started crying while I got 100 and didn't even study
Oh this is so relatable
JIANHAO TAN REFERENCE???????
I'm this person...
That nerd is literally me in math My parents were so disappointed bcs is got 1 wrong (in our country the max points isn't allways 100)
One. Mark😢
Are you boyfriend or girlfriend ❤️
I didn't study at home but 3 rank🎉❤😅
69 means 🌝
I’m I the only one who don’t study but always get good grades😅
It's sad for her cause she tried so hard to get a perfect score
Bro in my school if you get a 74 its a fail, for my parents they only consider 85 a passing grade, but the grade they want me to get was 94 but now its 98
I'm the class nerd
That one grammar mistake to get the 99 ☠️
Isn’t a 60 failing
WTF 🤬
Nah bro instead of throwing away her just trade your paper with her and she will be happy has no 99 not 100
Shcool clown is like me
I'm the class clown
*I thought only our class had this kind of nerd 😅😅😅😅😅*
The marks 69 💀🌚
People say "It's just a one mark" but the truth is her parents aill be mad if There's one missing in 99
That's That's average indian student 😅
me is the class clown and Nerd soo i dont care if i get 80 90 or 99
That one mark is really important for a topper. Everyone has expectations from her. If she will will score 91% also then also everyone will scold her. She need to study whole day. Backbenchers won't understand.   She don't play and enjoy, just study for that one mark
I'm not even the class nerd, and I still get upset that I got a 99 and not a 100 💀
"YIEAIT" hits hard🗣🗣🔥🔥
İ am class nerd but i never do like that👍💅
Topper no Punching bag yes
The yeet got me😂😂
I Am Chill Bruh,
She goes 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😉😀😄😃😂🤣
The background music 😅
Ouh. It because we angry because there's only 1 more mark to get to 100. That's the one crying. But if I was the kind of person who didn't study, I would have died with my mother and father😂😂😂😂
Wtf 😂😂😂
I'm the smart one/nerd but who doesn't study
Did anyone notice about the 69 joke?
Just topper things😢
I got a 100% in science
THIS ME WHEN WAS YOUNGER 😂🗣️🔥
GET OU-
Really this kind of students do exists i had bunch of them in my school days girls crying because they couldn't get 100.%  Why they cry so easily
☠️

bro dhadkan bgm
I am the class nerd but I don't wear glasses
Galing

Guys its actually sad cause if u worked so hard for it thrn u think u will get a 100 thrn u leave a mark and it really hurts
The one mark means they for some unknown reason care about school, or are about to get a whooping💀
That is so true
I am a topper and i totally get it ...after studying so much and expecting a full 100 that 1 mark hurts a lot😢😅..
That 1 mark... GETS MY NERVES

WTF
😂😂😂😂
Becuz they have studied the whole year whithout wasting to much time for nonsense and  her paryant ,s will be strictly strict that's why she is crying for 99
Project is the highest code in the class Ben 10 is not
Bro. 69 💀☠️☠️
Wtf
Well, most people like that have very strict parents and they live with very high expectations. After studying and working so hard for a long time, even the smallest mistakes feel horrible
Clasa nord has Asian perents
😢😢😂😂😂😂
POV she calls u dumb while not knowing 😭💀
the girl at the last like me
1000000🎉❤
IK LIKE SOMETIMES WHEN I GET A B PLUS.... I FEEL MY LIFE IS OVER
POV Asian kid's and nerd's:
Amitofo bro, 99?!?!
"I scored a 99 😢" "Dont be such a crybaby, its just one point... 🙄" The one point you worked so hard for: ...
The perfection is important my man
It’s no joke my friend got a 96 and her mom hit her with a stick and told her to work harder
The third ☠️
Suiiiiiii
Yesterday I had an exam and result is  86/100 i expected 90+  😐
NGL that's me like I got 36/37 and almost cried
i got 69% really 😅
How did I guess the Class Nerd's score perfectly😅
Don't write WTH write WTF 😒
The feeling when getting 79
Girl want 100 score so bad (lol)
As a snark kid, we hold ourselves to overtly high standards so now ever bad mark, we find a setback/hindrance, we feel useless, a disappointment in our eyes for we know we can do better yet we think "we didn't do enough"
Yeet 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
69
Me: good at arts music p.e History  Meanwhile maths: 💀
Bro you got an A plus
I can relate 😂
Bro, I get hurled after every test when I get a hundred and not a hundred and 5 cause I missed the bonus question 😭
89
No that Asian kids
What do you mean that's bad that's good😅😅😅😅😅🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊
no bc the nerd is so real one time I got a 91 and my sister made me believe I did badly..some families have very high expectations.
Je m'y attendais je savais qu'elle avait une super,hyper bonne note,car j'ai une camarade comme ça😂😂😂
me when I get 99, 9999999999999999999%
In the last that was indian song lyrics 🌝
WTH  WTF
Guys we cry even we get 99 because we done soo much effort to get 100 but we lost by 1 mark it's sooooooooo freaking annoying 😢😢😢😢😢 only toppers can understand my feelings 😢
69sus
Actually the toppers are under pressure at home. Even if they scored 99 put of 100 they be like "we did not expect this from you " And yet they study so hard   But......  I get the whole joke 😂😂 Exposing truth is my job 😅
BRO THATS THE BEST SCORE AND THE WAY YOU YEET IT ITS SO FUNNY
Bro why 69
No, we should not tease those nerds, they are not satisfied because they are under a lot of pressure, it may be from parents, teachers, or from themselves also, there is another reason, they might be working hard for a perfect score, but being not able to achieve that score even after so much efforts makes them think that, their efforts just went in vain, many others find this as a joke, but it's the fact
Common class nerds just like me too
But she works hard for that ONE score 🤷‍♀️
THAT EXACTLY WHAT I FELT WHEN I JUST NEED 1% TO MAKE A PERFECT SCORE 😭😭😭
Sometimes class nerd when they have 99 or 80 they r sad bcs they know that there perants is gonna kill them so that's why some people sob about 80-99
😅😂
and me: OH MY GAWD I DIDN'T GET A 0!!!
Thanks to py mother i never really feel proud of my grades
I understand it after 2 month 😅
ermm
Im test i was 100😂😂
*A definition of a perfectionist*
It's me 😅
Me understanding the class nerd tho😅
I’m not a person who gets the best grades but getting a 99 is definitely the worst score to get cuz you’re just a mark away to get a perfect score 😢
me as class idiot: (gets 25) omgggg i got soo goooddddd im happy i have got more then 10 wow!
im the class nerd iblitterly get 19/18 and be sad
You know why she cried Because she's only 1 score away to be 100/100 But if she gets a 98 she wouldn't cry at all
I once scored 9.9/10
if i got 99 my mom would beat my as
mmm its me😅
Hindi song was epic😅
Oh I do it the same like the class clown
Soo nerd
Bros a duumy99score?

Im the Nerd😅😂
I failed guys i failed in urdu i got 12/25 pls plray that i pass 4th grade im begging u
Yeah, 99 is the worst score you can have
thats me the one crying  =)))))))
As an academic achiever,i must say this is true.
Yes bro it's real
Why 69 only 👻
It is so true one girl of my class cried because she didn't get 1/2 score 😂
I know that feeling because i expect 100 out if 100 in maths exam. In board but got 82
Tapi bila 😂
He just used the song dhardkan😮❤

So that is what tears of joy is.
Dar ce că așa sunt și eu dacă eu nu iau 10 din 10 sau 100 din 100 plâng poate să fie și nota 9,50 sau 99 copii eu tot plâng
The Dhadkan movie bgm at the end 😂
In 99 we only see that we left 1 question. If we have worked a little bit harder then we could have get 100 marks
What bat si hab 99 scor haha❤
the one at the end is me😭
No one understands that pain of one mark 😢
Whatttt, that is totally not me👀(my dad keeps saying that he’s proud of me for my grades. How am I supposed to not cry when I get a B?😭)

I do great in all subjects in school without even studying much. The only subject I'm studying hard for is maths. And I don't always do great...but I managed to be satisfied with the grades I get in math. Why do I bother telling this if no one is interested in this...:)
Me real is school 60 \ 60 me see 42 Me see is boyz he 41 me her YAY! is girl cryng me why? me SHE 59
Fact: the reason why they cry is bc they either have strict parents bc they kept getting average scores every time,  ig that's why
I was a topper. Never cried when i got 99
Im 100%10👍🏻
Me i dont revise and i got 100 a'd my class revise and got 80 😂😂😂
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHA 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂

I didn't study mandarin but I got 85☠️
Universal problem 😂
Class Idiot ?
I'm the same as the class nerd
dharkan song
as a smart kid who is always pressured by her parents to get the best grades ever, that one point does hurt
That last one is me fr😂
I just realized... Does that mean Asians are nerds?
😮99   is    just    one     less Then    100
By south Africa if you get less than 70% you are dumb and a fool in our eyes
This me when.I say to my friends I have bad marke 😅
These videos make me feel so bad. People make fun of smart students and call us nerds. I really wanna clear this up: 1) BEING SMART DOESNT MEAN YOU ARE A NERD 2) YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON AT HOME 3) WE ALSO HATE SCHOOL BUT AT LEAST WE WILL BE ABLE TO GO TO UNIVERSITY  4) IF WE DONT HAVE THE BEST OF THE BEST SCORE YOU WONT EVER SEE US AGAIN  Hope this reaches the right audience
He is a Indian tamil boy
OMG! I'm 99 I failed in the exam 😭🤣
If she’s an Asian, I would be starving. I would be dead the next day.
That last one is me lol
The one who doesn't study is me. lol got 64 .3 last year
I don't study and usually get an 80-100
Here’s the actual reason, they have been studying really hard like at night, they barely get any sleep, they just needed one last mark, it’s just the pain studying really hard the whole night and losing one point, even tho it’s just one point, we expected 100
That one nerd😂
One time i cried because I got 54/60 in Filipino and I thought going to be beaten by the belt so my Filipino teacher wrote something in my commutation notebook and my parents saw my score and ................ they were okay and when they in paragraph in my commutation notebook they..........laughed so I was okay.
That reaction 😂😂😂😂😂

Celine:I got 99😭😭😭😭😭 Everyone in the whole class: throwing books at Celine  Celine: ah ah ah ahhhhhhhh
Getting a 99 is so annoying because you were SO. CLOSE. to Getting a 100
The thing is you study sooo much to get the best u can and u miss 1 mark from getting full marks and if u studied a little more u would have full but sometimes u study soo hard even just for that one mark and u lose it .... Once u understand its actually rlly sad
Idiot lol on gyat😂
To je moja spolužiačka Vanesa😂🎉
the way she is crying about it is because of bad parenting
More like Asian not to be mean because I would feel like that too and I'm Asian too
Nobody gonna talk about the fact he just said 69😅😅😅
meanwhile some people thinking something else for 69.
That is me after exam 99 markes still crying
Nerd be like vs the one that didn't study
I got a 💯 for my test
What!
That one mark depends on my life 😭😭😭 says the topper
The trio 😂
But think about that one mark and how others treated them about it
She feels like she is low score
Bro I need at least 80 to pass that’s the least😭😭
I am backbenchers
They don't know the value of that one mark 🙂
David looks like a squit games ali😅
Once my score hade incomplete score of .5 and I cried

Well that one mark is everything for them because they always do hard work skipping fun and enjoyment and always studying staying later night to study and waking up early to again study everyone would cry even if it is half mark 😭   IT HITS REALLY HARD FOR US TOPPERS.  "I am so focused on my studies and school I wish I could have fun like everyone else"  - A TOPPER 😢😢😢😢   😭

The last one is my classmate She is soo cirnge
She got a 2- on a art poster she literally went so angry
69.................... ............................
You look just like my classmate but taller 😅
its not about 99 or 98 or somthing ,its 100% hard work  ........a person working or studyding for 16 or 18 hour and she is expecting the same percentage she is giving in hard work
My call's nerd's excuse on being sad about an 99 was that if you flip it, it becomes 66 😭
That's me😅😅
I dont study and i get top in class
In my class there was a girl crying so hard and she had 98 she was so used to getting 100 bru i got 80 i did good but im lower
What we don’t know : 😢😢😢😢😢  - Study Hard - Extra lessons - Being groan by parents - Etc
You can't understand the pain and pressure of always being perfect
Bro I don't care about my exam as long as I got an A
The nerd, it's me......
I scored 39/40 😢😢im so bad
69😅😅
69😅😅
I think in Malaysia there's no class nerd because everyone already clueless on the first question 😂😂
Relatable
Those that don’t know why she is crying:it’s because her mother is ASIAN and if you saw minimoochi’s other shorts you would see that she’s crying because of her mother saying she has failed      Hope you understand it ❤❤
As a nerd i can relate to the nerd😂
The girl is cries.... Its srsly me
kinda cringe
😐
I'm just like her
U
Y'all don't get what that 1 mark meant

Pov: my class and me
Wth= what the hell Wth=what the heck
I love ur videos but sometimes they have strict parents and that 1 mark is a difference
Bts is becoming meme material now 😂😂😂
Bro do you literally said GET OUT
The nerd work so hard and she got 99 but thats just ok atleast she has a score 99
But even if a average or below average student gets passing marks its such a wonderful movement for them...😔
Class clown: haaaa  Friend:haa Idiot:haa Nerd:😭😭😭😭 Class clown friend idiot:😨😨😨😨😨
One time i cried cuz of a 9.75/10 lol i thought my mom would send me to the sun to be burned
Bro that girl sobbing is me😅😅😂😂😂💀💀💀💀
One time I got a 80😢
she has Asian parents.
People don't get it"It's JuSt OnE mArK" the mark: Studied for hours and worked so hard( I saw this in a minimoochi vid)
good 🎉
Sa Pilipinas be like hahah 😅😅
So good i repeated this 10× haha 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Yo con 99(9'9): siuuuuuuuuuu
SHE'S asian
No the yet
And also my behaviour is just like the nerd kid😅😅😅
You must get to Express to get a good secondary  school example "Nanyang Primary School".How do i know this because im a Singaporean
those who sont know whats a AI score that means your going to a good,normal or bad secondary school
I used to get full marks in all my examinations  and my AI score is 4 😅
plot twist:the class nerd was an asian
When she said 99 and camera move to his face the indian srk famous tune was ringing it confirm he is a pure indian love from heart ❤
Im the no study 100%😂
Only toppers can understand this feeling
But nothing is written😅😅😅😅😂😂😂in the 99
She was crying because she studied a lot for this and it's ok
Teacher sees 99% Nerd sees 12% WHATT
Class nerd aka the asian kid
in my scholl you need a 60 to pass
But 99 is the best😢
Kid with an asain mom be like😂
Our top student is just like that😂
In maths i got 96❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The class topper, I understand 😔
I am nerd but I cry at 92 not 99 it's a very good result
In that 99 me and my friend  will all pass with good marks😂😂
You  are so cute
The 99 girl is me when i get 4.5 /5
WTF
Its actually me😢
But the real reason is that, class nerd's parents still hates and tells "YOU HAVE FAILED YOUR LIFE, NOW YOU WILL BEG ON STREETS, YOU WILL DIE POOR" And even if we get full marks, it is useless because they act like they don't care and make you do chores.
i have mental issues in school
The reason some class topers do this including me it's because of overly strict parents but if we didn't have strict parents we would have been very happy for that score or just really want to be successful in their future so they want the perfect score atleast that's what I know maybe some do do it for attention
That 1 mark :
that boy was indian
i thought the last one was the asian kid cause you know
51 60 69 99
Me being the nerd 🤓 😂😂
I'm literally the nerd
But no one knows what’s behind that one mark…
That is the only problem they get 99.99% and cry and I get 50% and I am happy that I passed 😂😂
Hi
The yeet 🤣
That one mark:🧩♟️🖥️💻⌨️🧾🧷📎🖇️📏📐🖌️🖍️🖊️🖋️✒️✏️📝📖📚📒📔📕📓📗📘📙🗒️📄📃📋📑📂📁🗂️🗃️🗄️📊📈📉📇✂️🗑️✉️
wth
If my school had to score up 83😢 so hard
Im sorry but i cried over half a mark😭😭😭
Bro are you Indian
I am the nerd
that's me the class clown when i got grade like that the asian kid
Pov: me GET OUT 👿
Indian music sound, I like it. It’s in a classic movie, but I don’t know the name of it because I don’t watch Indian movies because I am only Nine
Actually 99 1/2 is the better then 99
😂😂😂
U guyz don't know the sacrifice behind that one mark😕😒
Fr tho, when you study hard for weeks yk how much that 1 score means
I am the topper and I feel so bad when I loose even one mark. TvT
That Dhadkan movie theme in the last 😂😂❤❤❤
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I thought it would be the Asian kid
For those who don't understand why she's crying: She is the top student and 99 is the WORST SCORE ever For top students Why? Top student parents are mostly strict and wants u to get 100 But if u get 99 they will call u disappointment And They won't love u So all top students Need to get 100 And im serious
Honestly I would cry too over a 99 because my father is a doctor and he expects me to score 100 percent in everything even though some of my teachers can't give full like for English the teacher can't give 100 and he expects me to be  beyond the rules  sometimes the nerds can be good too 😢
So actually she wasnt able to hold streak of 100
THATS SO RELATABLE..
Wtf
Okay what?. Everybody get under 50 me 75..
😂
99 is actually worse than failing bro its basically all ur hardwork going to the trash can
Does wth mean what the heck of what the hell? Tell me in my comments
My parents scolded me that i got 99 marks 😢
i feel like the class clown is actually a genius who knew all the answers and planned out the questions exactly to get a 69
How is it even that everyone in comment section is a topper? 😢
Yes 99% is just so low at list she should get 110
If I missed 1 point: My mum: why didn’t get the one point 😂
💩 poop
I have my friend who doesn't study and even teachers know that but gets 90% on his exams
Is 99 is is the best score😊😊
For people dont know why she is crying: she worked for hard and probably for hours and stressed and crys because she is so stressed while studying and she missed one mark and she did all that work for 1 mark low from a perfect store.
Nerd, stop b*******, it's not a big deal.
I got 100 on my exam
What the fuck
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅
WTF?😂😂
Why is that actually me😭
score 69 be like
Bro so much like my class topper
For anyone, 1 mark could mean so much. 99 is awesome but it makes you feel terrible that you didn't get that one mark. I would be very unsatisfied with myself and happy at the same time if I got 99 but if I got below 95, I'd be happy with my marks.
Just like my friend girl got 1 question wrong on every subject and crying 💀
Bruh i didnt study and got 97 for guessing almost every question 💀
in my school under 60 is fail
I remember crying one time when I got 97 😢
50 is the pass rate? Lucky my schools minimum score is 68 or 70
I always get somewhere between 90-99 and I am always so sad
WTH -WTF-
The last one got me rolling on the floor 🤣🤣🤣🤣😭💀
Brother what was that 69 supposed to mean? 💀
U dont get it that onw mark is everything all the hardwork 😢
A 99 mark is like being 2nd place I feel it now.
Me realize why they cry of the 99 not 100 bc the near family doesn't care of her only her test.😢
That topper😂99 mark
What 99😂
U don't know what that 99 mean to class toppers they worked 24 hours and one mark gone it means so much to then never say something bad to people unless u know how they feel about it 😢
I am backbencher  I don't study but i stand 2nd in class 😎✌️🗿🥱😏
Bro,when you get 99 marks,you know that 1 mark that wasted it took so many hours,like bro that's the worst feeling.
Most people probably don't know the story of a topper. The value of that one mark is like 100 diamonds.😢😢
SO DRAMATTTTICCC
I always get 100%
I am exactly like the class nerd
Backbenchers be like:Agar humko 99 percentage aa jaye to me mere dosto ko five star hotel mein party dunga😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂
Im so sorry lily i switched to roblox im not playing avatar world anymore
This is so relatable
Lisa is anna❤
Love ❤🎉
That one mark😢😢😢😢  Asian mom u r a disappointment 😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬
The last part indian song suits well 😂
❤
The clown got 69 💀💀💀
I thought  it  can be 99 1/2
I thought it was 99.9😂
Like me
THE YEET AND THE END HAD ME LAUGHING! 🤣🤣🤣
The one who got 69😅
69 😅
I understand bc it was just one thing you got wrong like why i was sooo close to getting 100/100
Me
The nerd in P.T 😂
😮
Why don't they understand 😢
The emoji just look like Celine this emoji 🤓😂😂😂
The class nerd.... But I will be happy if I get 99😅
Bro had 1000000+ aura after seeing her marks😆
https://youtube.com/shorts/Xdo0vBEugWU?feature=shared
Because of parents pressure that why we cry when we get 99
Fr my classmate got a nine one of the best marks in the class and because it was an initial test SHE DIDN'T WANT IT TO BE PUT (whe can choose if we want the note or not on initial tests) after some time she got another 9 and she was like looking like she got 4. Girl i understand u want to be topper BUT WORK HARDER IF U REALLY WANT IT AND DON'T BE SURPRISED IF U GET A NINE, THAT IS ALSO VERY GOOD
Yk my school needs at least 75 marks to pass 😅
0-69 is a f
Yorpaswed99
Its more of frustrated, panic, slight discomfort tham crying any jerd will tell difference
You studied whole day and night thinking that you got full marks and then know that you got 99 is the baddest thing in school days. 😢😢
😂😂😂😂
That is a point our happiness depends more then everything
I don't study by I got 90
Also her crying while flying : I don’t believe I can flyyyyyy
We nerds work very hard so that one mark is a lot for us compared to our work.
Me on other tests:🥱🥱🥱😥😥 me on math:🥲😓😥
When the nerd ruin everything😂
That 69
Bro I just got perfect timing on smth  I got on a vid that was like “HEY YOU YES YOU GET OVER HERE” then I scrolled on this 💀💀🙏🏻🙏🏻
Unknown
Every school topper only understand this   It's because topper like me when got 1 wrong my mom would scold me
"YeEt" had me dying 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Not the Asian mom 💀☠️ That’s why she is crying💀☠️
Bro David why did you say what the heck you should say WTF
The 1: Studying hard, getting punished by parents, no free time, staying up late for the exam, getting yelled at, stressed for the studies, crying over things because is too stressed for the studies, getting called a DISSAPOINTMENT, getting grounded, can't go out for the rest of the day to study, studying hard but still didnt get 100, studies over like 48 hours for the exam, everyday studying not getting to eat that much,drink that much or going out that much
Tje reason she cried was she studied almost the whole night for that "one" mark which "totally" doesn't matter to others.(I jus explained for fun)
😂 so good she told bad 😞
laugh attack
BAD F+
I am the class nerd :heheheh:
Dude you dont know how it feel when your one point away until greatest
I am that nerd😂
Bro I would cry too although I know we need to be grateful but like being only 1 mark away is tragedy because of pressures from your parents and teachers lol. Being a topper is a tragedy it self :>
69 is the best grade lavel
69 🌚
im that person at the end i got a 95 for math only one question was wrong and thats when my friend also betrayed me i was crying
😂😂😂😂😂😂
That one mark means a lot 😢
Can we talk abt the nerd went flying like"WEEEEE"
The kid from the secret facility who got a 100 without even studying because the curriculum couldn't catch up with him: 💀💀
99.9

That 1 mak is everthing for toppers, cause I got 4th rank only for 1 mark. i didn't top for 1 mark. I am not lying, I never did that bad😥

Life of a class nerd be like 😅
Asian parents:

Some people don’t get it they might have strict parents
I got 100 💯 i
the nerd is me
My score* 70.. mom: this is still bad 😡..
69💀
Reminds me of when a girl in class cried cause she got 70 out of 80, and these boys who barely passed were giving out sweets because they passed.
I am gonna answer to this video with one of the videos you recently made about  toppers.
THAT 1 MARK IS SO FRUSTRATINGG AHHHHH
Well sometimes when you put soooo hard work like so much targeting best -it does hurt as well wanted the best of us maybe best of that “nerd” you say it full marks-and there family pressure and peer pressure too -sometimes it’s bit dramatic but not always
the class clown score💀

Just to let everybody know The nerd has 2 reasons to be crying for 1 mark these are those reasons  1. She may have a rlly strict parent and it just feels bad to be in that position imagine u forced to be studying day and night by ur mom and u get 99 it just feels like nothing ever pays off  2. Or she just wants to be successful   THIS IS NOT WHAT EVERY NERD FEELS ITS JUST WHAT MY CLASS NERD IS LIKE (the nerd is me💅💅💅💅)
Asian Nerd kid
I can tell you nerds are not worried if they get 99/100 but they pretend to be upset in front of class 😌😌
Why do that😂😂99!?

Class nerd: got 17/60 failed she is crying 😭😂 Le my bestie got:10/60 😈
Honestly I feel bad for perfectionists and people who are pressured for 100%s, i myself get a bit irritated, even if for me its not a big deal, but its always annoyed me how some people can talk about it to people who got much lower scores. Like, dont make other people feel bad for not doing as well by acting like a 99 is bad, yknow? Its something I and other people in advanced math classes were taught pretty early(yes, im kind of bragging but tbf I dont do advanced math everyday just to not be able to brag a LITTLE). Which brings me to the topic of when other people lie about their own better scores or make them seem less good to cheer other people up. I think its good to remind your friends that youll be there for them if they need help, or that they can do better next time, or that its not the end of the world, but downplaying your own achievements doesnf really do that. To some people, it might feel condescending, especially if they find out you lied.
99 is a good grade
Naaaaaaah the YEET got me dying😂😂😂😂
People are taking "crying on 99 mark"as a joke they don't understand how it feels like we work hard day and night to get full marks I got 97%on my semester exam and I felt very sad even after getting it only toppers will understand the value of that 2%/1% and still people make fun of that are we a joke for you guys? 🙂
I can relate to this (The nerd): In my PE test, i scored 19.5 out of 20 😢
Background 🇮🇳 music: aaaahhhaaaaahhhaaaaa.....🤣🤣

"Real story" that time the subject was english the teacher gave us a test and guess how many i got out of 40           39/40.           There is also one weird thing that always happend wich is                My english teacher sometimes tells my friends to check other people test paper in my class the teacher gave me and my friends.Some of my friends that check my test paper sometimes do the wrong mark   Example/Really happend:I got 39/40 but my friend does 35/40 but I still got 39/40 because my friend said it was a mistake.

I'm exactly like the last one, except that I don't study. Last week, I had a spelling test, and I got 9 out of 10 and caused a scene in front of my friends
His 'hey' 'hey' sounds like Shahrukh Khan 🤩

Dude try to understand, toppers like these cry a lot even though they only get like 1 mark less than full marks because they had prepared a lot for that test (so much that they should have gotten 100) but when because of 1 question, their marks are deducted than it’s actually sad. I am also a topper, I also feel really bad when this happens with me
This is literally my friend group

Hayyy.... I just listen the bgm nathin als 🤣🤣🤣
Well the reasons smart kids cry even if they get a good score or not perfect it’s because their parents are really strict or they want to be perfect

Heah!!!....I got 72% marks i am a topper😂👍😎
Ya gimana ya, balik ke rumah ibunda ratu dah siapin segala petuah demi masa depan agar selamat sejahtera dalam menjalani hidup yang lebih baik 🗿🗿🗿
It does matter (no, I was never a nerd but do understand because my father was strict). The Class topper is aware of other class toppers. A chance to get into the Best Colleges you need to score the best amongst other class toppers. That means it matters when you not score 100.
Its ending song was a Bollywood song dhadkan BGM ❤❤ if u noticed
69 mark are the best marks ever 🌚

Who noticed "dhadkan" movie song😅

69 marks is indeed the best score
To be honest I hate 99 marks, if we did just a point better we would be a kid with full marks😭😭😭😭😭
😂😂😂😂😂😮😮😮😮
Ngl got 99 is like the most hurtful things can happen in the school life 🥲
Bro I am like the class nerd, I got 98 on my math test and I felt so dumb after loosing 2 points (I mean I did addition on subtraction 💀)
"you are not going to throw me out?" "Fine i will do it myself!" YEET
bro the 69 score reminds me of 💀💀💀
the crying nerd is this smart kid in my class who studies a lot unlike me(the nerd+never studies,just based off memories) he complains almost every single time he sees his test but yeah to me its kinda sad a little cuz the class clown sitting beside him prevents him from finishing his papers and also him being just 0.5 marks from getting A+
Im a girl btw

The YEET was personal lol
The only subject I'm good at *"English/Math/Mapeh?"* Welp we forgot about science- I'm bad at science

That's because maybe she's pressuring by her mother?
69 really bruh ☠️
You don't understand. When you study really hard and miss 100 by one mark, that's literally traumatizing
I'm totally the class nerd 😂😂
The reason why the nerd got 99 and she wanted to have perfect score instead having 1 mistake or her  parents force  their child score should be perfect😢
I felt like the nerd was asian for crying for not having a perfect score
Real😢❤😂
Noob99💯💯🎖️🏅🥇🏆🤯🤯
Nerds are smart then class clown.
I understand it maybe because if she doesn't get a perfect score she gets yk like scolded for not doing good like that😊
Im the class clown😂
Okayyyyy so I've a student and though she is not the topper actually she's not even close to being a topper but she keeps crying after every exam and everytime after the results are announced. I need you all to understand that such behaviour might seem to you like that of a topper but we teachers hate such students. I honestly don't like such people but I never get mad at them as well but my colleagues are being driven insane by the girl I'm talking about. She thinks that it will get her sympathy and people will regard her as a topper but in reality all the teachers now just are waiting for one reason to throw her out of the school.  And though it's brutal but I can't stop them
I know why because she died get 100
I wish
Apparently I'm the nerd.... Sums it up perfectly😂
Indian Background Music
So true
The class nerd is me
69💀☠️🌚
In last dhadkan movie tune is so slayed❤️❤️❤️
If i got 99% score i am 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
This is me
Their passing score is 50*??? My school's passing score is 75%-
She's perfectionist like me the nerdy but I realized no one's perfect 😊
That song at the last got me roll... love from me...😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
When you work sooo hard, when you don't sleep many nights to complete the syllabus you'll not just cry for 1 mark but also for a 1/2 mark.   Edit :- Glad to know that there are so many people who can relate. Also thanks for the likes❤️
Class clown + nerd -me
The thing makes sad is how their parents treat..I know the pain..
Me crying when I got 99 bc I'm proud 😭
Tbh i am the nerd, bcs i work SOOO FREAKING HARD, and i lose my marks. I got 99.375% in my maths exam, everyone then asked me where did the rest 0.625% went, and i made a multiplication mistake..UGH
Class clown ❌ Dirty mind ✔️
*WTF*
Nice
Me when the teacher say i will give money if who gets perfect score
It is true
That background music in the end ❤😭🤌🏽
I had the same score as the class clown, out of 75 😃
I'm the class nerd, I know that feeling😢
TRUE FR IN MY CLASS THIS IS A DISASTER SPARK
bro same with me if i get 99 then i will cry my heart out coz it just that 1% mark lost so i will cry if i get 90% i will be ok coz thats 10 % lost so like yeah low graders wont get it (no offence )
What happened to the failed one?
Just like my friend I mean she scored 97 and she's crying  and sad abt it all day  while me I got 48 not even 50 marks and i smiled all day sometimes I just wanna 👊😅😂😂
Hey i was the class clown and i actuly got a 100, the 50% was luck and the other 50% was being smart😅
true😊
Like if you can relate to the nerd
She's crying of joy DUMIE
That just means they have very strict parents.
Hi
I thought the video would call the crying kid "the Asian parents kid"
69 huh nice number ifkyk
ุ69 5555555555555
That one person always want a 100%😢
Well it's kinda true until Asian parents and teachers that are the mother.
Tha T
BRO THIS VID IS TO SU THE NUMBER 69 IS UPER SUS
69 flip 69
HI MOOCHIII im a PSLE student of this yr 2024 this will be what my class will be like when we get our results pls wish us luck i love you moochi and friends
Literally me 💀☠️ for some reason idk
So true in my schools
Now i was a complete nerd and lemme just say i didnt cry over a 99 score its still an A+ i would be fine with a B 80 or higher im fine 70-60 im upset with myself 59 and below i would die from my parents whooping me
Last time there was an exam and I didn't even study and I got the highest grade
I don’t study but I get A
i think, i am the last one😂
ONLY 1 MARK TO GET 100😭😭
The class nerd is me!😭
my school too
It is not the nerd it is the pick me that gets good score in only one class
I'm the class nerd in my class (I ace science multiple times, never 100, alwags 80 or 90)  When i got 76% on my recent science exam, i had an internal breakdown
The one who have studied hard will cry even for a half mark.
"yo guys i got THE SCORE" 😂😂😂
I AM the class nerd ( i cried over a 97% ) lol
Change "Yeet" to "GET OUT!!!"
99+1=100😅
What some peopke don't understand is 99 will make a phrase like  "are you an idiot? It is just one point and you can't even get it" come out.
I was so schocked when he showed his result
That is me misses 1 question my life is ruining
TBH im not the class nerd
Nah I cry when i was Young i get 99 and cry because of my mom is the teacher She always say Many things hurt me And when I cry She say "Why cant you be like the other teacher daughter She dont cry and she is younger than you!"  .... lol
I got 28/30 I and didn't even study
Bro their so lucky because in indonesia if we get a 75 we dont pass
My teacher joked about giving me a 99 cuz i forgot to add a comma. She actualy gave me a 99
Everyone in class the be like 👁👄👁
My class clown gets avarge 100
So relatable, when you study very hard because your parents expect so much from you
Look as a smart kid getting something over 95 hurts so much because it's so close to 100
me not getting A but B crying 😢
explanation it’s pretty short by the way: the nude was crying because she got a 99 not 100 so she started crying because her parents are gonna beat her up I think
Did you guys notice the class clown just holding back and do the exam to score exactly 69 to make it funny?
the yeet was too personal
Doesn't study is me 😂😂😂
Ama kız haklı abicim
I scored 99😢😢😢 lol 😂
That is crazy
Wtf
Nah the last one is relatable one time i got on question wrong and started crying and said im a failure 😭💀
look darn honestly, i have been at both ends and I have observed that a 99 hurts more than a 60 or 69, because at 69 you weren't even close to being close but at 99 you were a hairs legth away from perfection.
Nah class clown got cancer💀
It's not out fault is our parent's fault they beat us up
what am I doing at the end?😂😊
OMG FFR THO IT’S THE WORST WHEN YOU’RE ONE MARK OFF- I WOULD BE CRYING TOO IF I GOT ANYTHING LESS THAN 80
It makes me so angry beacuse people think we are nerds but out reaction is like this beacuse we know we will be yelled at beacuse we have mostly really strict parents
As a golden child the "school nerd" reaction is so realistic, 'cause if I get just one point less then the other semester, I start to hearing thing from my parents
Thay YEY😅
The nerd is always a pick me 💀 oH nOo iT wAs tHe wOrSt sCorE I coUld eVEr gEeEeT!!
Believe me guys that 1% hit so bad 😂😂😢😢😅
yeettttt
My comments would be buddy's 999 comment 😅
my friend whenever she get 9.5 and the full mark is 10 she always cry
💀I'm not a nerd cuz I get full marks without study but this is kinda relatable cuz I got 19/20 and I lost the one mark cuz I didn't see the minus and thought it was I plus( I did expanding and factorizing double and triple brackets and factorising quadratics with algebra)
Video:🙂🙂 The song at the end: 👼👼🦸‍♂️
Why the fuck is this in my fyp why the fuck watch 6 year old content with indian and Japanese couple doing shit bruh💀
Pov: teacher gives detention to nerd. Nerd: MY WHOLE Life is ruined. Now I can't go to college.so I also can't become a docter or a engineer.
Wth
We may tease her but we don't know her actual pressure by parents and all
The movement when we get pass mark  Oh god u helped me a lot 😂❤
No on ever will find out what 52 number means
I am sick of these copy writes
Why is no one talking about the 69% 💀
Should've added GE'
Maybe the last one's parents are so cruel 😢
Haha, the last student
The real pain is when you got 34 out of 100 and 99 out of 100 😂😭
the nerd has an asian mom lol
I swear I'm not a nerd but I do all the things the class nerd did in dis video... I do cry, one mark mahhh, cannot lose mahhh... Haiyaa.
that doesnt study is one of my friends, sheis annoying AF, im also friends with the class nerd
That Indian song in end
If I in same position I will sad too 😢
Her parents only allow her to get 100% or something Why are you crying over a 97
the class nerd is literally my bestie, girl cries for getting highest in class
Fr my class topper cried bcs she got a 78 out of 80 in her test
0:10
Bro it minght seem crazy but i experienced it that 1 mark made me sob soo bad i am crying the whole day
Girl literally me when I got a 99.5 on a test I was almost crying
Dude why is it 69 💀
Like me the last one, yesterday i got a paper of biology, i get 19/20 i feel so😡😡 to teacher and😢😢😢😢 where's my one mark😢😢😢😢
The bollywood music at last ❤️😂
Bro the last one part looks like it's said she was a fairy 🧚‍♂️ 😂 🤣 💀
That one 🤓 nerd who keeps crying over the lowest score😊
For the dirty minded people the third one scored 69
You will never understand.
The most I've got is 98 I  grade 1btw I didn't even study anything
that one asian student: *dead*
The indian serial music at the end got me😂💀
Actually it is very disappointing to get 99 after much hardwork
I always get 99.. in my school there is no 100..
Bro must have Asian parents ☠️
Can someone tell me who from svt fell down??
Hey hey sounded like srk.. 😂❤
I know for a fact david put the last sound himself
The nerd must be asian
That's me I got 19/20 I'm almost criying
I would cry as well if i got 99% 😢😢
I am the one that didn't study and got 97 marks😎I am so lucky🎉
America:of course in the america below 60 is failing 😊  Philipines:of course in the Philippines if your below 75 is failing 🥲
That nerd got Asian parents, that’s why they’re crying
Damn.....The nerd have the Asian Parents
Bros like all 3 of us can pass in that.....
She was a fairy ✨️💅
K but seriously when you missed a mark just cause of 1 silly mistake, I’m gonna be on the floor crying 😭
I actually got the score but then the tescher said there was a mistake :( i wish i could minus 1 mark
I am the one who doesn't study much but I am class topper or above average girl
my class vs other classes when got a 10/15  other classes: cries  my class: proud and happy :)
YEET 😂
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅 so funny
yall dont get it tbh, we feel sad bcz of the way we lost that one mark, not because we scored 99. When you expect a 100 and score a 99 is sad
The last one is literally me 😅😅😅😅
Class nerd score 99 and you are crying failure cry 😭😂😂😂😂
Hi i am 9 and a muslim can i join you but my mom should not know haha just joking but i am 9 and a .uslom haha
Lol i dont review but still get good score
😂😂😂
The nerd it’s like every Asian kid that we find every day now 😑😑
I GOT 92😭😭😭I DID SO BAD...
I don't even study or review but I always get first place
When you study 24/7 for days and nights sacrifice everything just to study your happiness your comfort ,everything...and still not get enough marks how would you feel?......was i not good enough? Was all my work not good enough?..all my hardwork and patience...was that not enough?..........exactly that's how we feel......
Like me I am nerd
That's how i feel when i dont get a score of perfect in esp☺️
Dhadkan music 😂 🇮🇳
ACTUAL nerd: "Pathetic..." 🗿
So relevant 😅
I am the class clown
When i heard the crying i thought it was the asian
it's not about getting 99% it's about being 1% off perfection
💀.... you know my score is 98
Typical asian students
*Nah the Class Clown's score is wild💀*
Yup thats mei mean im not a nerd Ima a. Smart kid And when i get 79 its ove
behind every nerd there is a toxic parent who expects nothing less than a 100
I'm that nerd 😭
That one mf in every class
The class clown is a genius, not only does he know the answer to every question, he knows exactly how much questions to get wrong in order to get the funny number. 💀👁️👄👁️
😊😊😊 she  was a fairy😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅 😢😢😢😢😢
Me: doesn't study, doesn't pay attention  Also me: How the **** did I get a NINETY-NINE
I don't study at all and every test I'm 80% that I got 1-2 or no mistakes and a 20% for me to have 4 mistakes
See the thing is we are happy with the marks but our parents will just say why did you lose marks and they scold us it ain't our fault.
One time i got 99.5 and my mum said U disappointed the family
THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO ME, like I was like "okay" for getting 60 score and this smart friend of mine suddenly chat me "My score is so low, I got 88... I wanna cry..." then I sent pic of my score.. and she remained silent 😂
Thats my friend 😂😂😂😂
69.....🌚 if you know you know
A typical Indian classroom 😂
I'm the nerd
Class clown marks wasn't a marks
Feeling good listing bolywood music in last 🧡🧡🧡
It supposed too "GET OUT" not "YEET"
"Class nerd" Me: Asian student
NAH IF I GET 99 IN MY EXAMS I CRY LIKE BRO NO ONE GET 100 THEY GOT 80 AND THEY DONT CRY LIKE HELP😭
That's literally me
I absolutely hate the feeling of frustration seeing how your 1 point away from perfect   I felt this b4 you feel both disappointed and satisfied with a 2nd place medal😢
How bro attacked the kid 💀💀💀
my friend in the score got 99, and he said that his mother will spank him for not getting that one mark 😭
Nah vro I am happy with 97...
Thats me 2 mistakes are very low 😅😅
Literally I’m the last one …😅😂..
the nerds are just flexing
Me that got perfect against the nerd  Me:🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
buv has Asian parents
Nah bro there’s so much pain when your grade is between 95 and 100 because you didn’t get 100 by only a few points and for a stupid mistake you made
They being so ungrateful + when they r ranked as topper their face is like "😕 i could have done better"
Me scoring 58/60 without studying 💀
I got 2 99 mark
Imagine you studied the whole time without enjoying your life and miss that 1 mark it def feels bad
Literally me, im so disappointed about myself if i have 1 more wrong or if i almost got a perfect score.
That clown is me
Just like when you got number 2 at a olympic
EVEN I GOT 99 IN HALFYEARLY THIS YEAR AND I AM SO HAPPY
Today I got our exam papers and then the nerd in our class got only 49 out of 50 and she started crying and then fainted while me getting 32 being happy 😅😊
I'm netd class
Me:7/10!! Wow i did so good!!!  My friend:😭 Me:yo bro wat score did u get My friend: 8/10😭😭😭 Me:BRO THAT'S SO GOOD My friend:no it's not shut up 😭😭😭 LIKE BRO WHO CRYS WHEN THEY GET 8/10 IN A QUIZ?!?!?!! 💀
Yesterday was my exam,the class topper was crying because of this and I was shamelessly laughing with my bestie knowing I'll fail in my test. 🙂
Honestly, I'm no nerd but if I got 99 I'd get so angry Like, what did that point go for?
Mostly, class nerds cry to the high scores because of the pressure they get from their parents. For instance when I get 47 and also first place between my classemates my parents simply ask " Why you weren't able to find those 3??"
Soooo relateable
My battery literally 51 percent
I always cry when i get 99 😅
True 🫡
Me being the last cryin i got 99 on english
You don't have to lie about your language, language. It's just language.nothing will do something
In my country under 70 is not passing💀💀
I remember once my friend got SECOND PLACE out of 48 students and she said she was laughed at by her dad. WHAT?
am i the only one here a nerd like that and cries?
Imagine passing with 51😂
Copy
Lol I remember in grade 4 I got 99.5 in maths and I started crying
69💀
Just like todayyyy😅
Also me: getting 40 for an exam and congratulating like how Lee know won in a fishing game 🌈🐬🌊
That’s the highest score😅😂
Ikr my classmates always crying of 99
The nerd is definitely asian
"I gave you a reason to cry" ahh move
She maybe has Asian parents
I am the one who don't study but still get 80
I'd be happy with a 75😂
Not gonna lie watching them crying for 1 mark make me feel like a dumb once a girl seat beside me she got 14in16 and started crying so much i couldn't even console her cuz i'm the one who got 9 i just realized that i am full dumb looser 😐
my mom is so strict she makes me score 80-100 all the time
Why is it always the girl ?
Why am I the class need 😂
ITS PAINFUL ONE MORE POINT THEN PERFECTION
69💀
I hate getting 99 on the exam 😢
cause she is asian thats why she's crying :|
Bro his dad is definitely asian
The one didn’t study is so me
Accurate.....
Well that nerd is me because if I get mistakes it means I don’t understand that and the studies are useless.
Yas❤😂
True😂
Actually u don't know how much it hurts when nerds just lose 1 mark or ½ from getting full 😢
Yey😂
Bruh
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
And there comes a backbencher who scores a 100.
I expected the yeeting😂😂😂😂
THATS LITERALLY ME!!! In one od my exams, i ALMOST got a PERFECT SCORE!! I ONLY NEEDED ONE MORE QUESTION CORRECT, AND THAY PISSES ME OFF SO MUCH 😭😭
"GET OUUT!"🗣🗣🔥🔥🔊🔊‼‼
I studied then fail then cry
Never in my life have I never studied once
The third one: I got THE score (69).... If you know you know and if you dont we need more ppl like you
I wished I had a score like 99
Fact : the reason why she's crying because she has asian parents
Not me getting 66 at flipping it around telling my friends I got 99 😂
Not me realising ddlj music in background
Eho listens the indian music when she showed her test paper 😂😅
Dud i worked for 100% not less, so it hurts 😢
Some people don't understand how much a topper works hard and than still not getting full marks that too for 1 mrk Hurts!
38/40😭
Bro but actually when I get a score that’s lower than I usually do (like more than 4-5 points), then I start to feel bad-
the 69 score!?💀
I also got 69 in english and my whole class was like.....🎉🎉🎉🎉😮😮😮😮🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉
Me at the end:99% bro is scored 99.9%
LUH in the Philippines having a 70 is not a passing grade. Either you get a 75 or 80-90
The last one is probably me 😅
Iam the Doesn't study kid
You know, getting 99 is a lot heartbreaking to me than getting barely pass.  Since to me, 99 means I should have spend 1 extra hour to study more instead of resting.  Barely pass(40+ in my country) means I have done my best not getting fail.  Basically the same concept as getting first, second and third in school or in Olympics.
I think she have asian parents😂😂😂😂
I NEW IT IT WAS THE CLASS NERD SAD ABOUT THE 99%😊
Once i was the class nerd now i am promoted to class idiot.😂 I won't even look at it in public i will just fold it in half and stuff it into my bag.😅
The nerd i thought thats fake but now shea in my class
I think thats how many wrongs
plot twist: the nerd crying bcs her asian mom wanted her to get full marks💀😭
NERD ARE NOT COOL
Me getting a 99.5% on a test in 3rd grade (Still upset about it😢)
I always get 90s or up but if i get 89 i hate myself
I am the class nerd✋😢
I'm the nerd I feel the same way
My honest reaction: Btw I got 49/50 om my science exam
Yes the one got high score in the class they will cry literally 😂 I don't understand
YEET 😂
Smart kids in my school be like 💀 :
My classmates always say I'm the class nerd
NO BUT I HATE 99'S
I'm a nerd but I'm in the Philippines sooo... 😄
It's just best score🧐🤨😊
Last song was a secret part
Me when I got a B+ and knew I wouldn't make it out of my house alive: Welp, I'm not getting a funeral.
My best friend after scoring 99-"worst exam ever!;-;" Me after scoring 79:ha mine is the best!✨
That one episode of Azumanga Daioh
Today is my result day
😢😢😢😢😢
The pain of 99 is unmeasurable but not the pain of 96 lol
that's my friend the nerd
Wth
Im actually the class nerd i always get that 😂😂😂😅😅
Me, an American, taking a second to realize that 51 is infact a passing grade in some places. Unfortunately for me-it’s a 70 here and my school is just about as hard as the places where it’s a 50. My entire family in from one of said places (India)😅
100 score in exam: 💯💯💯 99 score in exam: 🙃🙃🙃 98 score in exam: 💀💀💀
I wld rather get 98 than 99
Thats really me when i was grade 2 😅😅
I am the last one
Honestly when i get 2 wrongs or 1 i say to myself i could've gotten that IF I DIDN'T CHANGE MY ANSWER AND TRUSTED  MYSELF I COULD'VE BEEN P E R F E C T
That's why I hate that type of nerd: Crying because of exam score.exam score: 99%. BRO THAT'S A GREAT SCORE YOU SAY "I did soo bad 😭😭" BRO IM FRUSTRATED ITS GOOD VERY MUCH THAN MINE😤😤
...
I guess, it depends on the effort to put in to study, if you don’t study and get a passing grade it’s like yay, but if you study super hard but don’t get the grade you want it’s like disappointing
I fell u 😂
Same...Same...
Thats hurts when you lost that one mark for a silly careless mistake😂
I thought it was going to be the asian kid
THIS IS MY FRIEND WHEN SHE GETS 95🥹🥲
That last one is just my trauma after get home..
I am a nerd and doesnt study sometimes i litteraly get almost perfect scores
The Class nerd was usually me
"HEYYYYHEYYYHEYHEYYYYYAAHAAAHAAAAAAAHAHAAAAAA" THAT DHADKAN BGM HITS THO

8th
Me the need be like:
the last one is me in year 1 😂
Nerd one is just me
But that's like when you expect 100, 99 really breaks your heart... People just don't get it
what did i watch????
Cl tho if ur 1 mark off a grade you feel it deep icl also i use a high grade and pretend i think its bad to annoy my friends
Normally I get the hundred out of 100 😂😂😂
U know it really matters bcz topper student's parents are not happy with 99 marks too they want perfectionist and thrn they ask where is that one marks gone through it
Calling 99 bad 💀
Bro the 99 girls are so annoying, like who tf cries in class
The class nerd's me, only I'd say "you don't understand. You're used to getting bad scores, I'm not" While scoring the highest in the class 😅
Im the class nerd😭
I literally did the same thing as the school nerd today
I don’t study but I get A’s The nerd is so me “a 98?!?! IM A FAILURE!😭”
bro is calling me class nerd 😭
There's always that one person who's always crying over that one mark...btw luv u mooch 😂❤
I have the same class nerd 😂😂😂
I was crying on B+
My friend once cried just cuz she got  13 out of 15 😭
That hindi dhadkan bc music 🎉🎉🎉 Celine and David 🥰
I am the class idiot 😭🤚
HELLO EVERYBODY👺, YEP THATS ME🥹
I like the flying 😂😂at the end
and that 99 when there are no mistakes😢😢😢😢
She is same as my friend
TBH it is really the worst marks ever 99/100 . It's better to get 98 then 99 even 80 mrks feels better than 99😂
There is a child in my class and in one subject she got 7 out of 8 and in the next exam she got 1 out of 10
Me: 100/100 yess 99/100 bro ugh 98-6/100 YESSSS 5-1/100 idc that subject is the worse
That one guy who got 69
😂😂😂 perfect 😂😂😂
Bro called me class nerd in 69 different languages 😢
Bro got 69 mark😂😂
Also for the art kids they make mona lisa but still says its bad
The nerd tho is like me 😅 Nearly close  The ones who relate 👇👇
I’m not a nerd just bc my mom will kill me if I don’t get 100/100 tho…
Dang 😂😂😂
THE NERD ONE IS SO ME, BUT THE PROBLEM WITH 99 ISN'T THAT IT'S NOT 100 IT'S BECAUSE OF HOW CLOSE IT IS TO BEING 100, FOR EXAMPLE IF I GOT 89 INSTEAD I WON'T CRY IN MOST SUBJECTS
I also feel bad when you got that near miss. Just 1 point!!!!
As the smart kid who doesnt study, i definitely butcher anything not regarding language, math, history, religion, and science.
NO WAY I GOT A 98% SCORE ON THE ARAB SUBJECT
As soon as my math teacher said that the passing score was 40 but i got 33:welp i hate myself😢
51 pass??? If you want to pass here it has to be 65-78 cause some classes 65 some 75 some 78 most of the time 75😢
So relatable ..
Literally my friend when she gets 4 out of 5😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Oh my gyatt.. So relatable in my elementary years😂😂😂
In my class there is this one girl who said say had a low score  ( her score was 92% 👁️👄👁️)
Thats just.too relateable😮😮😮
I'm the 2nd one
The point is she's Asian that's why she's crying
Pls no one laugh but am the most popular one in my class and am a nerd
I can feel that topper pain ! Cuz i'm too topper 😉...
Wtf.
yaaa... after working hard.. and giving your best that one mark is really important... and sometimes those students can have their inferiority complex or something or there is an issue of their parents try to understand those students even though this is just for fun😅
Minimoochi is getting obsessed with Indian music  Thanks to David❤❤😅😅
The class clown marks 💀💀💀
Why is 69 funny
This is the way parents think school is
you should follow the SG AL system
If hou dont understand that the nerd cdied with joy with her score❤😂😅
Nahh me whyyyyy Not them indirectly pointing at me when they showed the one that lost one mark and cried
My phone is 69% charged 👀
Not the hindi song in the bg❤😂
why is this so relatable
Can you explain why 99 out of 100 is bad
not me thinking about my friend who got THAT SCORE in her english exam...
That class nerd is me but still dont studu
im got 25/24 and im don't stud?
Its so painful to get 99. More that 90
The class Nerd Thats Me definitely me u thing
Me to 99😂😂😔🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
-hello- -there-
-hello-
The last ones me 😢😅
Not the Indian song 😂
The fact thay i sont study at all but i always get atleast 80 marks. But a can confirm im always disappointed. When i score a 87+
85%
getting a 99 hurts more than getting a 90 tbhh
the yeet 🤪 ✨️ 😍
What 69 my innocent😢😂
Plsss collab with n8ck and carrie
NO. YOU DONT GET IT. I ONCE GOT A 9,98 (highest is 10) AND THE PAIN I FELT IS JUST SO.. AGAHH
99/100  is passed but unlucky lol
No one : the topper
I am the topper but backbencher and the rest you know😅😅😅
When i got my math score i wanted to cry so bad but i put it all in and kept smiling but then this girl she started crying and crying, i asked her what happened and she said "i accidentally left a question so i lost ½ mark"... i was like, so you got 79½/80😶 and she's crying... "bro! What?" And she said,''You won't get it! I knew the answer!"... and this guy walked in and said, "She's not gonna die or something,  just leave!"
That's like in my school math class. I got a 0.666 (66%) on my test and a girl who got a score like way higher than mines started complaining about hers
I get depressed as hell when I lose a one mark !
You are in ❤
You know the worst mark is 99 and you just realized that you got a careless mistake and to lose one mark😢😅
YEET💙
Want or don't want challenge part 2 please
David i like you hair style because is same to BTS Jungkook
Tbh our class has a combination of class clown+ nerd/topper ...and i m an average so me be like :do i exist?

📌
Class clown + Class idiot is me😂😂
I got 95,46% in English and I cried bc I didn't get a 100 and ik that if I didn't get 100 my mom will give me a lecture-

In my class I got a higher mark then the smart kid in there favourite subject  She hates me now
Knowing that you were so close to full marks hurts more than failing
We 3 students would have passed with 99 marks
Me be like:
I got 17% on math
Wth
I got an 39 out of 40 without studying and also thought it was bad and it turns out my incorrect answer was actually right
That one Asian kid who got 98: I think I'm going to heaven💀💀
i actuly got 69 for my math lol
The girl in my class, she cried for 49 out of 50 because she always gets 50 out of 50😂

Ur acting skills day by day 📈🔝    Edit thnx for the likes💜
I am the one who doesn't study and only got 77 higher than the smart kid he got 76
Yahoo! 18 hours!!!!!

Actually me
Hi there
Nerd maybe you mean us ASIAN your gyat will be woop by a flip flop😂

Ok but the nerdy one is me. 🥲
I got 69 to on my maths test
The one that doesn't study is me😅 And I sometimes even get a perfect score on the exam😅
I once got 99 mark in english subject and that's really dissapointing 😃
The nerd is me I need my grades perfect
That "99" was epic 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
shes asian so thats why
Actually that's me 😂❤
49/50 I got it I cried in school
Bro thats the hightest score💀
It depends, if the total items in the Test is 200, then I'll cry too if I get 99.
No because why do I get it! Like it’s not gonna kill the teacher to up the score by 1 mark
Tht happend with me while I got 99% my mom killed me😅 Some things never change like Asian mom
Dhadkan Bgm at the end ❤😂
Backbenchers becomes businessman, brokers, lawyer, political aide and thugs. Rest becomes slaves and doctors.
Bro I am tamilnudu
Nerd in philipines just gonna say tbh it was easy for me and not gonna cry
I don't study and got 33/40😂
That guy at the end is me
My minimal score to post is 65 bro
In the class nerd I got a 6/7 and I cried
Thats my friend she got a C and she like no i did bad like girl i got a C a D and uhmmmm probably an F idk but bro like wth is still higher than everybody's
The class nerd is my friend at Chinese school and another friend at Khmer school 😅
O hell naw 😅
The end girl nerd was me
It wasn't us, it was our parents  I cried when I lost 3 marks just because how disappointed my parents will be in me, they used to taunt & disrespect me and lemme know that I am a big failure every chance they got Now I barely pass in college and don't care
Like my class
Im the class nerd tho, dont worry i got Asian parents
I had a dream about you both, that you are my friend and you have come to my house.
That's not nerd i'm also a topper even when i lose even 2 marks i feel so guilty because according to my hardwork i don't think so even 1 mark can be detected
I have an exam today.wish me luck
relatable i.did my physics test last week and i got 87 and i wqs happy and i had this classnate that got.97 and was begging for 3 marks
Every pickme topper
i feel like 90 or 80 is better then 99 because 99 hits different in a bad way it’s like 2nd place.
Me and my bestie literally throwing a party after we get a D and the nerd crying cause he got an A on a test at the beginning of the year
not you guys yeeting her   you both just makes me so happy
Wo Banda Jo 99 paa kar ro raha hai 😭  Mai jisko pata hai ki aab Mera jindagi Mai kuch nahi hone wala 😶‍🌫️
literally me when i get 24/25
Idk why but getting 99 for me than like 80 because I did so hard to try and get a perfect just to get 1 wrong..
For those that are wondering what does the class clown mean by I got the score.. we need more people like you ❤😂
instead of class nerd, i would have thought it would say Asian
The kid with the Asian parents "MY MOM AND DAD WILL KILL ME😢😢😢😢😢"
Me is class idiot
Shouldve added the "GET OUTT" Sound 😭
im the last one for sure i got 24/25 on my first high school test last week and felt like a failure
The last one is so me... don't yet me pls
Well those kids only act like bc their parents alyways perfect every time so maybe that's why they are like that😞
Where i live in America, you need a 70 or above to pass
The Siowei Yeet!

The 'YEET" is always the best move😂😂😂😂
Helllo
㚂脉络就算好好情人事实际  It isn't that bad but i know how that feels when ur do close to the best

Not me doing this not wholeheartedly as a nerd just to piss my firends off
69 ? 🌚
Guys....I would rather get a 60 than a 99....you feel so bad for that one point 😭😭
I had one class mate who got really good grades and she would push herself like crazy and if she get a "bad" score she would be super upset and stressed out. I always tell her there is room for improvement before the important exam, i did worse than you (yeah i failed maths and history and science. Good thing i pass during SPM😅) she would always smile after i said that
Why 69 whyyyyyyyy
Bro i always get good marks in english but in this exam i litterally got 79 and in our country 80 - 100 = A+ So i just missed out A+😅😢
If I had 99/100 I would cry😊😅
Celine and David are getting relatable day by day...(minimoochi plzzzzzzz reply to this )
Only topper do it
He got 69😂😂
U don't know how hard she tried
One of my classmates was crying because she got 73 when I got 69 ( I wasn't crying I was happy I passed ) 😂😂
Bro y'all so lucky, in my country under 74 you dont pass😭😭😭😭
And her Asian dad would ask her: where did the 1 mark go?
My friend also do like this
In my class there is a nerd who was crying for a half mark but my friends told happily I'm passed
Bruh..thats actually me😅😂😂
😂
Class clown be like: Ey look at this🌚🤡 Others:Ahhhh...💀
There's are different between 100 and 99 100 is all you can get and  99 is all you get
😂😂😂😂😂
That's so real when I tell my marks to my besties while crying that I got the worst marks in my whole life they be like "STFU girl u got the top marks why tf r u crying"
Ok I am definitely the mix of class clown didn't study and class idiot💀
😂😂😂
The 69 got me😂😂😂
I'm the girl who got 99💀 And my mom killed me
The nerd was me. Once I got 98 in a subject but was supposed to get 99 since the teacher checked my paper a bit wrong. I went to the teacher twice but he didn't even see my paper because according to him I got the highest in class so I should be satisfied with my marks 🙂
Class nerd❌️  Asian kid✔️
That's every class story dammm!
OMG IT IS SO TRUE . EVERY DAY MORE REAL .as a need class i understand. IT HAPPENS A LOT . YEP . ❤😂🎉

Imagine having mastered the basics of Japanese hiragana down perfectly many years ago and recently during exam for basics of hiragana you got like 9 out of 10 because the teacher mistaken に for しこ. I understand how the nerds feel now......T-T
I love mini mochi so much❤❤❤❤❤❤

For me, it really hurts to lose that 1 mark, knowing i was soo close but couldnt make it
i am definitely the class nerd
That one student who don't study but get best score and they parents think they work so hard but they didn't 😂😂
Why does David look like Fawad Khan a little?😭

I don't cry when I make a mistake... FINE YOU CAUGHT ME 😢😭😭
You guys dont get it. That's the truest thing ever
Me realizing that im the class nerd 😢
dont call me a nerd  I am just a school  clown but I always get 99/100 in my exam
At this point I'm convinced that Celine is obsessed with bollywood😭
You used Indian music...❤❤❤ Love your video 😊
Who noticed 69 🌚🌚
BEST DAY EVER🎉
The last Indian song is my favourite❤
In defense of the nerd, 99 on a test worth 100 is the same as you coming in second place because of a tiny bitty mistake.
Bro the score he scored in dirty mind
nerd: *hated* asian children: *cutely depressed with fake smile*
When the one mark goes only nerds could understand its feeling😢😢
😂😂😂😂
LOL SO TRUE 😂😂
Honestly it really differs but its always upsetting when you had the potential for the full mark but still dont get it + strict parents or expectations really stress someone out, even uf theyre satisfied eith their result 😭
3 Students can Pass the exam in 99😂
The nerd after they got a 99.9 on their test *Mother, father*. **deep sigh*** *i have disowned and failed this family.* *Please forgive me* The mom and dad: 😀😀😃😃

Celine and David always made us laugh and the true😂
I'm the type of student who doesn't study beford exam but still manages to pass
Last exam I got 100%  but I was so sad thinking I hadn't done my best😅
I once got a B in English and I cried so hard as if I have a year streak on Duolingo and I know I'll get killed now
Last one is me I got to 99 but still I was crying in class 😂😂
I feel the feel when you place 2nd place and only one step away from being the 1st
I actually feel bad for the nerd tho.
No but the kid with 99 probably cried cuz the parents are the type that goes “after everything, u still missed out 1 mark”… they're really not fun
The girl at end is literally me...i have potential to score 99 mark but how i left that one mark‼️😢😢...😭😭😭😭...
me who got 7/50 in math:....
In one hour 25k likes 😮       BTW big fannnn!!!
Means, im a nerd i cry even if i get 3rd or 4th or 2nd position 😢
But tbh it really does feel disappointing even if your parents don’t care or whatever.
✨she was a fairy ✨😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭
She is crying because her mom is asian
I swear i got a 100 and 90 on my english and math test without studying like bruh i was literally playing my phone before the exam
Ngl if got 99 i would be happy as fuck . But the "NERD" only know the hardwork she had put to it . (~NO HATE~)
I absolutely expected it
*sighs* that class nerd scoring 99😢😢 Me scoring 9😂🎉
Is it just me who heard dhadkan music ??????😂😂😂😂💜💜💜
I've seen this scene 😅
The class nerd + Doesn't study is literally me 😂
HELP ESPECIALLY W/ ASIAN PARENTS OMG 😭 😭 💀🤭✋
Yeah........ 99 is bad 🤦
My smart friend: NO I LOST 2 MARKS OML UGH Me: BRO IF YOU DON'T LIKE YO MARK SWAP IT WITH ME BECAUSE THAT TWO MAKRS YOU LOST IS THE MARK I GOT-
I even got 69 today ; ) MARKS
BRO THIS IS SO REAL 💀!
Me who actually got 69 for English 😂😂
The clown one is me btw 😅
THE ONE WHO DOESNT STUDY IS SO ME (I GOT ALL 60 EZCLUDING ONE 70 FOR MY EXAMS 💀)
¹
I know the pain in the ass when it comes 99, just stoobid enough not to get 100 just bcs stupid mistake
I was sad bc I didn't get 10/10😅.
I as the student topper are really like that cause its just one mark again to get an hundread mark
The class nerd is me😅
Nerd:  gets 99 and crying like crazy 😭 Me: WHERE IS THE BASEBALL BAT!!!! BRING!! THAT!!
That background music at the last it was the Hindi song I love this song❤❤
I need to do this   One time i got 69
Even tho I don’t study when a test or a exam begins and get 100%
Me belike at the end:
The score🌚💀🤣
Yeah it's literally true... But I think they worked hard and didn't get full mark just because of one mark . Maybe that's why they cry
1 hour
Actually it hurts when u get a 99 because only 1 more mark for a full score...
That yeet was really very an appropriate move 😂
YOU DON'T KNOW THE PAIN OF GETTING ONE MARK LESS THAN THE FULL SCOR😭😭😭
When you're the only one smart in the class😂
Make sense because 99 flipped = 66
Asian parents 😔
I'm class nerd
Isn't 99 is da best sorce ever?
The nerd should be the Asian 🤓👆
The Last Throw 😂😂
I hate these kinds of people (cry over high marks), but im friends with idiots like this
The nerd is me, BECAUSE WHY WOULD SOMEONE GIVE 99
I know u guys are dating I saw nicks video
I’m literally the class clown with 69%
The truth is children arent actually sad due to marks, they are sad due to parents fear  Like yes good marks are imp, like any thing above 80 is great
Nerds be like 😂😂
I am the smart kod and i can relate to the class nerd.. Yall dont understand what we have to go through... Just even if we get99 our parents CANT accept it! Try to understand our lives better 🙏
That’s me who’s crying rn 😃👍🏻🥹
😂
But why the class clown get 69 👀🌚💀💀💀 Edit : Celine I need answer!!!..
Thus proved that david is indian because there was an indian song music at the end
The celine 3.0 at the end is a definite asian😂😂😂
The dhadkan music in the BG LMAOOOOOO
Real though, My friends are so many like that😭😭😭its just THEN WHAT ABOUT ME🥲
Celine's✨ YEET✨ and fly got me rollin 😂😂
today was my result and I also got 69% 😂😂😂
THAT LITTERALY HAPENED WITH MY FRIENDS TODAY
Yup Deffenetly my bestfriend who cries over an 100! 💀 she litterly got a perfect score and still cried and she said she wanted a 101💀 like wtf whod you get that i dont even know thats even allowed😭
Same at the last
Plot twist: the nerd has asian parents
So true 😂
U dropped this 📌 can I take it.😅❤pls❤
Edit: not being rude I love you're videos Soo much❤❤ When the class nerd is an asian😂😂
Oh geez, perhaps we all do have different reactions as to how our exam results look like. But really, getting a 99 on the test isn’t bad at all (unless you’re being treated by Asian mums) 😅
Every class has that nerd😂😂
The person at the end is me
Bro what
Just pass don't get 98 or 99 🙃
Okay but in reality top students are pressured that's why the top student is crying because she knows she'll get beaten
The one who pours her entire body and soul to study to get perfect score can understand the pain of that one less mark
The last is me 😂
Rip
I feel for the nerdy girl bc I can relate to this all too well but in a game :(
The class nerd is me lol
~Maybe the girl with 99 out of 💯 made a careless mistake which made her lost the one mark and her mother is probably asian and will smack her with the slipper? -Or does she think her marks are not good enough or she just wanted pity??? 😭 Who knows? Anything can be possible honestly....
The thing is that people have the high expectations from others because of which 99 which would be great for others would not be good for the person who scored 99 as people have high expectations from them.
Not that much but....  When I scored     '69'     out of     '80'    my Parents asked me    "Where Is The 11 Marks "     And that's how a Topers life goes when others are laughing at me for panicking about my marks.... 🥺
im nerd lol
That was YES with 90 + Marks Students where Me Scored 55( ANNUAL EXAMINATION)with Top Score in MATHS where Used to get 51, 49 & 53 and the 90 + marks  Students is CRYING and ARGUEING with Teacher " How could you do to Me like this"because She got 95where she is Used to get around 97, 98, 96 and ME.😒( Litrealy get angry and want to throw them out because they extend the PERIOD 50 to 1 hour 20 minutes)💜in class 9th.
I’m the class idiot whenever I pass there would be a celebration in the class😅😅
Class nerd❌ Class topper ✅
Explanation: he has a asian mom and the asian dad

This is so true😭
Bruh, that's so true
The indian song in the background 😂😂😂😂😂
Me who studies super hard and still doesn’t pass 😢
Moral of the story: "Don't get 99 and Be happy"
I had a classmate like this  In hungary there is other scoring thingy it goes like this: A=5 B=4 C=3 D=2 F=1 4 is counts a good grade. She started cying so hard when she got her 1st 4 ever...😂😂
"The score" was meee
That dhadkan movie's bg music 😂😂😂😂
Guys u never get , u tried hard but if u  have got 1!!!! 1 freaking mark u would have reached😢
Thats so true i was literally almost crying cause i knew i got a mistake in my math test
tbh, getting 99/100 is kinda sad(not to sad like her) especially you make a dumb mistake
