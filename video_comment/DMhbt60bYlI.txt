Crossed Sabers insignia means he’s from a Calvary division, but the shield with a “1” and wings could represent 1st Calvary but they didn’t exist till ‘21 but the character looks like post-Civil War. Also 1st Calvary formed in Texas could explain his southern accent.
That's Skull face
I just can't get excited anymore.. no matter how much I want to. it just doesn't feel the same, and it will never feel the same. It makes me feel old..
Calling it now, the western dude is THE Jebediah Brown
If this man talks any faster my brains going to flatline
Where is Dempsey??
Looks like developers can’t seem to agree to either stick to their new characters or the older ones, nevertheless it’s an upgrade catering to both sides of the community.
Only thing missing is an A7X song
Theory is this is the guy who invented the PAP
Some people say it’s the jebediah guy who created the pack a punch
I’m not gonna lie the trailer is cool but me personally I’m kinda weary about where they are inside a building. As far as maps go for me I’ve never found the maps based in or around a building the best. I’m just hoping there’s a large outside area.
Style over Substance. That’s what’s really been missing in these cutscenes. Like they look awesome but literally does nothing to draw you in narratively. I feel the devs don’t trust the players attention enough to try and fit more of a plot in here.
I hope it's better than this trash ass black ops 6. I'd be surprised if people even end up buying the game.
Looks like the big guy from buried
So 8 player zombie mode incoming?
Ngl I think you tripping I’m hyped for this new character looks way better then dr Monty might be peak villain
Are we getting a 8 player zombie mode???
What if the trailer is hinting at 8 player parties?
omg not a new villain who will trick us into doing some bs for the whole year only to realise " OOOOH we were helping the bad guy so lets restart" literally what's been happening since BO3 every single time... even in Chaos story in BO4 and not just Aether, all the endings are so sooo weird and feel unrewarding
Sounds like farmer brown from buried
I could be wrong but I believe the insignia on his hat is the army ranger cavalry crossed sabers or at least looks very similar to it
Isn’t that the guy from the double tap soda machine?
Sadly Call of Duty since after Cod ww2 is for fruits anymore. Its pathetic
Yh not getting fooled. Haven’t had a good zombies map since bo4
The smallest glimmer of hope. If they mess this up its over for cod zombies.
This guy is so fucking annoying.
I think we going to be zombies looking for a cure
WE NEED THAT RECKONING ENDING BREAKDOWN!!!!
another shit show that doesnt look so shit now but definitely wont be bo3 level ever
any kind people out there that can fill me in on where tf the zombies story line is at. I left off on the first few maps of bo6 when Samantha came back or something
I bet Activision begging mr rofl to keep supporting them. They better have given you the beta this time and a release bonus
Water gugins 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
Im glad to see some familiar faces. i wonder what this means for the Aether though.
ass
Im not even hopeful for zombies.
It’s high round noon 🗣️
Could be Black ops 2 Buried all over again, but yet again another zombie Game  this time 8 players
Buried remaster maybe ???
Jebediah Brown
Ghoul is New Warden?
I better hear Richtofen say the most diabolical stuff in BO7 and people are theorizing its the Shadowsmith aka the guy who made the pack a punch machine in buried and the Agarthan Device
I think this was a pretty sick trailer honestly.
Hopefully there's a friendly fire option for zombie with lots of unlocks for playing cooperative
this is one of the best trailers i’ve seen for a zombies title in YEARS HOLY W COOK
My headcannon is this is jeb but from the alternate buried timeline where richtofen wins instead of maxis and rules over the zombies and one head is richtofens and the other is samantha.
How much did you get paid this time to glorify the fuck outta this game, bro come one you complained like crazy through out BO6 life span, you are one of the people who should be requesting major fixes within the game and storyline but instead this is your reaction to a game nobody wants.
The cutscenes are always cool but then the game suks. 😂😂
Bro I thought Cod was dead but after seeing this just mind blown 🤯 damn now I gotta spend $100 now …
It looks like the guy from the fallout tv series because they don't have any original ideas anymore and are just killing the game with each new edition they don't listen to the fans and just keep making shit after shit 😂
1:29 missed the perfect opportunity for a good old “fetch me their souls”
Total Walton goggins fallout vibes
Its skullface from mgs
Its sad to feel nothing seeing the old crew come back.
1:41 looks like the dude from oh brother where art though? Still straight ass though.
He looks like Hunter S. Thompson not the guy from fallout
Bootlicker
Did anyone see the zombie bear?
all im saying is, this will be a total missed opportunity if they dont remaster the buried map. the main villain is literally a western cowboy, and if it is Jebediah Brown that would make even more sense since he was the one to create the ghost witches in the buried map.
Don't care about Black OPs 7 has I am done with COD and all there BS. Half what the promise each version never happens game has just gone to crap. If they just did a zombie game I would probably be down for that
Man  I can't believe they put skullface in cod zombies  Even after all these years he still cant find the guy he was looking for
This game is already a failure
turns out its leroy from buried
This is gonna be straight ass 💯👑
It’s about time we got a badass. Cowboy !! I bet it’s Jeb brown !
That's not the voice of Jeffrey Dean Morgan right ?
u got ADHD??
Everyone is saying Walton Goggins, but I think he looks a lot more like Daniel Craig!
Cool but cod is a dead game since vanguard
Cant wait to sit in a slightly different looking corner and spam an infinite ammo wonder weapon. As long as you don't need any skill whatsoever past round 10? Like every game they've released since ww2? I'm happy. Would also be nice to be able to press a button and revive someone across the map, so I dont have to deal with any zombies. In fact? Anything that requires even the slightest bit of skill to accomplish needs to go. Why not just make a button that instantly warps you to whatever round you want, so we dont have to fight any zombies at all?
That’s my dad
This is such dog water it ain’t even funny anymore! Was a good run COD!
Just for those who are curious, I asked Nolan about Takeo, and he told me he was re-casted and will be doing a less judo japanese voice.
The shadow smith's is his name milo
There's just no end to this storyline. Same shyt rinse and repeat. Maybe next year..
5:31  US Cavalry ?
does anyone know if there will be zombies directed in bo7 at launch?
Richtofen looks like Tony Hinchecliffe
If he isn’t the new announcer for zombies, that will be the biggest fumble ever😅
You guys ever watch this guys first videos about a cod title and then skip 6 months into it and he can’t stand them and how horrible they are. It’s comical and one again here we are with him hyping up another title he will absolutely talk crap about in 5 months time.
I hope they're trying new formulas for zombies.  Bo6 wasnt that bad, but the ones before, hated
I immediately think this is gonna be a throwback to buried
I wont lie, the first thing i thought when I saw cowboy zambo, i thought of Jebidiah immediately
To me it seems like a resident of Buried that was sucked into the Dark Aether. When he says “I know I know you’re confused. I was too” seems like a line that means he was once a mortal sucked into the zombie verse as well. I’m assuming he’s like a veteran of the dark aether and has survived. Also his aesthetic is probably drawn from the fallout guy because that was a huge success and COD mostly copy’s other stuff now a days.
that little orgins call back to them pointing the gun at each other was kinda cold
Anyone else hearing engineer from TF2?
It’s Leroy from buried trust
its just Hudson after year in Bydgoszcz Poland
My guess is that he is sherif from the map Buried in B02
What if the 2 skulls are Dr Monty and the shadow man
Hi 👋,  been watching you since a kid. Thanks for keeping the magic alive.! ❤❤❤❤
I like that there are so many frames from this trailer that could be awesome desktop wallpapers. Well done to the artists who made it.
I like that there are so many frames from this trailer that could be awesome desktop wallpapers. Well done to the artists who made it.
It’s gunslinger in DBD guys
To me, he sounds like the guy who did the voice of the engineer in tf2 to me
“I haven’t seen this yet…”   Has Walter Goggins image ready to pull
“I haven’t seen this yet…”   Has Walter Goggins image ready to pull
2:06 good way to cash in on some one else’s game
1:45 thats exaclty what i was thinking too
one of the mummies from the tomb
GARBAGE😂😂
He kinda sounds like the cowboy from dead of the night
4:14 asking is like we know
is that Walton?
Dead of the Night.
Looks exactly like Daniel Craig
I used to be so obsessed with the story but idk after B03 zombies ended I’ve had severe gamer erectile dysfunction. I’m staying cautiously optimistic but I just don’t know anymore. This made me feel nothing when I should’ve? <\3
What’s exciting about this trailer ? Stop faking your reaction lol
Do u no wot would have been cool if he came out with to flaming dogs next to him and said fetch me there souls … they no we want the dogs back
Hopefully they got rid of the dogshit warzone mechanics and make it more like bo3
His voice reminds me of Rick Grimes from the Walking Dead.
Bo3 was the last zombies in my book
They should have stopped making zombies content after bo3 tbh
Loooks horrible
Milo's passion must be truly inextinguishable to be so ecstatic for cod zombies in the big '25
how can the announcer say “fetch me their souls!” When their souls are already fetched?
Also I was really hoping that background music was building to “Shepard of Fire” by Avenged Sevenfold.  Greatest opening to a game ever, BO2 Origins.
Sounds almost like Troy Baker.
I want to know about the skull he didn’t use!!
Woke Fatigue! not spending a dime on anymore call o fduty til they purge their woke out.
Shadowsmiths intro was so elden ring mixed with the va god they did good with that
This is so much better than the liberty cutscene lol
Skull of nansapwe baybay
His pants are now feeling creamy! 🤣 How much is Activision paying you to act like a cult member MrRoflWaffles!
Did this guy just drink 10 red bulls or what?
I seriously don’t understand how people are interested in this. And if we’re being real the liberty falls cinematic was just as good as this cinematic. I bet this cod will flop just as hard. I miss old zombies, and that’s just my opinion.
“Fine, I’ll fetch em myself”   Serious note where is Richtofen/ Samantha from the rooftop? Is the family up there just listening to this chaos below?
Not caring about any of these characters really makes this hit like a wet noodle.
NAH THAY COWBOY WAS THE DUDE FROM INFINITE ZOMBIES OR ADVANCED ZOMBIES THE ONE WITH WXO SUITS THE DUDE THAT STARTS THE VIRUSES EACH MAP WE GO TO the dude that gets shot AND TURNS TO A ZOMBIE
WW1 or Vietnam vibes
His Outfit Hat and the Saber on his side gives me Civil War Vibes though the sunglasses through that way off.
Bring Leroy back lol
I had lost hope but we are so back
My opinion let tom kane have the og takeos legacy make this takeo speak japanese and have it so non of the crew understand him at all cause i feel like it would bring that comedic dialogue from early cod to bo3 and also tom kane doesnt have to to do anything and he keeps original takeos legacy
I do t like that Nikolai voice
No Zombies Chronicles 2 No buy. I just want Buried
1:48 && Rick grimes with the hat & the line “this too shall pass” lmfaoo only recognized that cause I just finished watching the entire walking dead series for the first time from start to finish without stopping😂
Nah cause you dont understand how gassed i am to see the old squad back i was screaming
10:40 To my knowledge the weapon kick up was also seen in multiplayer gameplay, so I think that animation will perhaps be some sort of quick pickup gameplay feature for the game.
Don't be talking smack on the Tennessee draw
if i dont get some Negan whistling i will be disappointed
He looks and sounds just like an actor from a show or movie in just can't quite figure out who
It's an American Civil War uniform, too faded to tell the color.
I want to play as him lol
I hope they include a solo zombies option for ALL MAPS.
Why is the community getting excited… all they have shown is the 8 characters (known for a while) fighting zombies (the regular enemy since 2018) on reckoning (the last map released). Yeah ok the villain looks cool, thats it. We already know that this game is just bo6 bs mechanics on   some cooler locations. Dont glaze this.
I couldn’t be any less excited
It’s like the skull that you can use in Zetsubo no Shima 6:11
Game dead before its even out
Why did they turn to a health bar above the zombie’s head and armor plates? Just make it old school
What is zombies even about anymore
The skulls are Dr. Monty and the shadow man?
I can tell he’s TRYING to be excited.
8man lobbies???
when he was absorbing I guess their souls with the skull it was very reminiscent of the skull of Nan Sapwe from zetsubou no shima . Visually and the sound effects used when it was activated
Love or hate what Call of Duty has become… you can’t deny that the zombies cinematics always go hard (at least when they actually give them a decent budget to make the cinematics)
Stuhlinger
The skulls in the cage remind of soul boxes but they have been fully controlled/weaponized
Something about the skulls and soul sucking reminds me of the Skull wonder weapon / field upgrade thing from Zetsubo no shima
It's a ghoul with a nose lol
do not buy black ops 7
I haven’t really watched anything zombies related concerning the new black ops, is it looking good?
Well, that didn’t take long took you exactly two seconds after the trailer to say you hate something. It seems like that’s the only reason people who want your content is for you to hate on it weird flex.
the irony of fetching primis' souls
Plot twist: This is the bus driver from tranzit
to all dbd fan doesn't the antagonist kinda remind you of deathslinder, especially regarding the eyes. just something i noticed
Ngl this gives absolutely nothing in terms of information
Just hope you don't start the game with a custom weapon and gumballs
Calling it now, that's Stuh
There you go confusing the whole Community again
i was literally typing a comment how the main villain looks and sounds just like Walton Goggins from the fallout show and Milo said the exact same thing i was typing lmfao . perhaps the voice actor is Walton👀
I played since Blops. I quit when WW2 released.  Is it worth returning to?
is that joe biden
Looks like shephard
I love how Grey & Dempsey work together, and so do Maya & Takeo, but Richtofen & Carver, along with Nikolai & Weaver have moments of like "untrusting" and look like they wanna shoot each other. I feel like we're gonna get some good character dialogue for once.
All the women they put in charge of a man's game have ruined Call of Duty. This all started years ago, and now has come to an impasse. The lack of creativity is at an all time low. The developers have literally ripped off Fall Outs main character from their TV show now, because they can't come up with their own fantasty Villan. They can literally make up anything they want, and they still cheat at creativity and rip off ideas from other creators! What I can't understand is why anyone over the age of 8 still plays this game. They have done nothing but rip off ideas, and cater to the 8 year old's. They have ZERO original ideas, and only rework and reskin older features that no one liked, and shove that crap down our throats. Keep being shills, and keep playing this junk after all the bullshit they've put their community thru over the past 20 years, and you'll keep getting it in the ass just like always! It's sad and pathetic!
"Fetch me their souls!"
Skull(s) of Nonsapwei??? Are those Sam and Ava's Skulls?
Is it possile he is the announcer? Like the zombie that says fetch me their souls. He did drain their souls from the look if it.
Can’t wait for Nikolai to comment on needing to use an ammo crate while he’s re applying a sheild after paying 15000 points for a perk!!!
I can’t wait for it to have a pretty good launch map and then fall off wicked hard.
I thought it was the fallout guy too!😅
i have a theory the skulls he has are dr monty and the shadow man but its probably not true given how bad the writers at treyarch are now - mostly based on the fact the skulls are floating
the fact im not excited or happy in any way at seeing the og crew come back is so sad, treyarch have completely ruined what i used to love, zombies just isnt zombies anymore.
Zombies is gonna save cod lmao im ready
Bro, I swear the new Dempsey looks like Jon Bernthal from The Walking Dead 😂😂
Disclaimer: Wet blanket buzzkill incoming.     They can make the cinematic trailer look as crazy as they want, but it's not going to change the fact that BO7 zombies is just another "Cold War" that was made for the Warzone clowns to grind their camos in.  If you think I'm being unfair or wrong, the only thing that I have to say to you is "cope." Harder.  I definitely won't be purchasing this next COD or any future COD until they stop half-assing the content for the zombies community.   I suggest that if you ever want to see improvements to our mode, you do the same. ❤
Black ops 6 is the only call of duty ive not brought ,it sucks big time
I can't even pretend to care about the story, so long as Samantha is dead. (A.I Sam doesn't count)
So guys hear me out i just watched it and noticed something idk what you think but the symbol logo on the cowboys hat it reminds me of the old bo2 zombies rank system with the skull woth blue eyes and the guns and knifes what if that symbol resembles the old rank system and its a hint to it returning for bo7. Tell me what you think get this likes so mr roflwaffles sees it
Is that guy a confederate?
There pulling a Bo2 with zombies again 2 teams on one map totally gonna be easy Easter egg
Shdow Smiths-blacksmith-jeb brown
Jeb what happened to you?!!
Western soul sucker = Buried confirmed? ....please?
Nah that looks like the bad dude from Westworld
Yeah no zombies will be going somewhere once i see some gameplay. Gonna need more than nostalgia and a character that just looks cool.
I really dont want them to retcon the shadowman and montys backstory
The trailer looks good but lets be real the game as a whole is gonna be a rushed pile of shit 🤣💩💩 pls don't get easily fooled by the trailers like "WE ARE SO BACK 🤓☝️" 🤦‍♂️
Let’s just call him the ghoul 🤷🏻‍♂️
Its Jebediah Brown 😎 it would be funny
I am sorry Milow!!! There is no way to feel excited anymore for this crap. I understand you are a CONTENT CREATOR but i am moving on from cod... I had the best of it and it's time to keep the good old memories good. Have a good one
Can't wait for this to be the same shitty nothing burger story with horrid optimisation.
What if the 2 head n the cage is Shadow man head and Dr Monty head
reckon theyre recasting the new crew, they didnt say a word this entire trailer so i doubt the original voice actors came back
Damn Ava the Forgotten Chiild!!? We may actually get story for her how she came to be is already spicy , but Maxis lesbian fling bout to find their daughter tormented by Hudson look alike lmao( I like that actor from fallout very nice comparison)
FOR THOSE WHO DONT KNOW, THAT IS KING SOLEMON(Soul of Men). THE FIRST CORRUPTED. THE SUMMONER OF "DEMONS"
Walther White
Where’s raptor one?
All they had to do was cut off the rampage inducer😂😂😂
"This to Shall Pass"..... I just Googled the meaning to this line that the cowboy sheriff looking menace has said and WOW!! It's almost like Activsion knows how bad zombies has been and they are working on fixing it but then again it's Activsion so I could be wrong.
People still keep saying “Nostalgia bait” who cares man, if it’s a good story, stfu and enjoy the ride
That first part is simply the Pentagon looking map. What's it called in B04 classic or something. God I miss dead of the night and couple other maps on their and I can't believe I'm saying that but those maps and that system was better than I thought when it came out. It just is.
Me as soon as the Shadow(Rancher) Smith started talking: "Is that Jebediah Brown?!"
So uh no gameplay.
He’s the figure in the mirror that Ava got pulled into
How tf you going to do a video on a new game when you haven't even seen the ending of the last one? Do you even play call of duty zombies?😅
Well, the sunglasses look like Adler's...
Im convinced COD can drop the crapiest game and this guy pancakeffles or whatever his name is will still glaze 🤣 looks the same as BO6
I got Erron Black mk vibes
My prediction… it’s the guy from all those promotion posters from bo3, or the same dude he has blood stain outlines all over the walls in bo1 the guy holding the card, if yk yk or look it up could b him 🤷‍♂️ also, is he played by Ed Harris the actor? Bc they look similar n there voice kinda the same lol
Cowboy gives ove cavalry vibes. The emblem on his hat shows sabres crossed over a shield. Crossed sabres are generally representing cavalry in military. He also has a sabre on his person. Also is wearing spurs which was worn by military cavalry. My guess is he is from before the civil war shortly after dragoons became just cavalry. As for his story....he has been there for some time and has seen people come and go through time hense why he has modern glasses that he just thought were so stinking neat he had to have them lol.
Im at the point in my life where I used to LOVE zombies played for hours everyday, now it's just repetitive and menial. But God ill always love the story.
So good to see the old guys!!!!
Anyway it is western like Buried.
I INSTANTLY THOUGHT "THE GHOUL"?!
How does he not give you shadow man vibes
First glance had me thinking it was DEFINITELY The Ghoul. Not a resemblance of him
This should of been the end cut scene of bo6. Therefore underwhelmed
Battlefield 6 looking better and better by the day
Just hear to see how many times Milo complains
Where’d all the bo7 hate go?? Lmao and we wonder why they keep making games
Bets on it being Alastair Rhodes?!
First thing I saw with his eyes was the sky in origins. Idk maybe he’s the Aether manifested as a human idk
The bones on his hat looks like dule bones level from bo2
Fuck zombies. No super EE in 6 killed it for me
They adding fallout ghouls to zombies
has no one noticed in the top right of the poster it kinda looks like misty and russman
We had the warden now we have the sheriff
He does look like the ghoul lol
Buried all over
I’ve finally come to the conclusion that rofl is nothing more than a man baby that’s cries in awe of any light spectacle he witnesses. Absolute disciple of the soy
I think the cowboy guy is Jebediah Brown from buried. (man who created the PaP machine)
Only thing I’m excited for is character quotes.
Noticed the truck in the cover i bet we will be driving and shooting some point
Zombies is single handily carrying the franchise my lord
So have they all became undead now?
Bro it's Walter White! look at his face and listen to his voice. Or it's Heisenberg because Walter calls himself that way.
Man I really hated them bringing the og crew back but damn was it cool to see them in this
I miss just normal zombies bro, not a huge fan of the magic and aether bollocks. Just send me back to the 1940's n let me kill some zombies with 115 blasting
Most random villain intro with no build up but also Monty vibes. Also this cinematic did more for the BO6 crew than literally any of BO6 lol. That being said BO7 as a whole has me completely depressed. We shall see.
Good ol’ Jebediah Brown
Shadowman 2.0
They actually have a chance to redeem themselves  i just hate that they acted like the old crew would never come back after bo4. Now we need transit crew back asap
Wow! That was WAAYYY better than I was expecting. Well done Treyarch!!
If your an og like me that's Adler from black ops Cold war the sunglasses say everything as well as the scars on the face but the question is how the fuck did he get into the land of the dead he scared rictoffen that's not a human that's something else Adler has changed beyond recovery
No
The cod cycle repeating it self
Maybe that new character could be linked to the buried map in Zombies. Think about it the first person who experimented with 115 and made the pack a punch is from the buried map.
This is crazy I fuck wit it the most hopefully gameplay follows this is way better then liberty Falls
Im getting mad max vibes. Looks awesome
He’s the bus driver.
It would be absolutely crazy if the shadow smith here is Jebediah Brown, aka the guy that built Pack A Punch
Burired
Reminded me of the villain from West World.
this trailer is garbage .  we as fans don’t want to see lame action scenes!  we want good vibes and storytelling and charakters that make sense
They trying so hard to save cod ..
if they bring back the old crew with the new zombies mode i will burn this game for the next 50 years and won’t stop
glad i can give you the watch instead of call of duty :$
Cod shill
crap.....
This shit better not be like warzone zombies 🙄 trying to combine two different communities that don’t want to be combined! Warzone/Zombies are two different communities and it should stay like that. Everything been ass since bo3
Fallout remastered coming soon.. preview. 🫢 MW4 without ZM 🎉👍🏽 Milo you tested this Game, just say straight: shit or shit? Finish.
Only reason I still play COD is bc of zombies. If they just keep making good zombie maps and quests I’ll be happy!
ITS JOE BIDEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I like how each person on both teams helped each other.
Is that Walter Scoggins' voice for the Headslinger? Also, he Shang Tsung their ass😂😂
My theory , it’s gonna be like verukt , 2 spawn rooms depending on who you pick , you gonna play as the og crew or the new crew
It's Dr Monty in dark ether form 😘
They literally  gave everyone a  cool moment
@MrRoflWaffles Destructible Environment is actually a really good idea. Beats having to BUY YOUR WAY PAST SHIT. Also cool way to trap zombies and stuff. Also also, Realism. Imagine blasting through a Wall to the outside because you got cornered.
What are the chances the cowbow is Jebediah Brown?
I really, really hope this guy's the new Announcer. I'm ready to move on from "generic gruff Russian guy" Forsaken voice.
Who is this guy?  Idk. I’m sure they’ll sell a skin of him!
by the way i think  you hear Tank´s Voice Actor when he says "and who the hell are you"
Still probably not going to be picking the game up unless they really impress me but damn do they know how to make a trailer
Heads of Monty and shadow man?
I’m really thinking Jebadiah brown, the voice just sounds so spot on to me
The logo reminds me of. BLack ops one title dlc name logos!!
Can't lie it looks pretty clean, but i'm still not buying it. Call of duty has to learn the hard way, for things to change.
New favorite character!
It's Jebediah Brown
I feel like what he did was he took half of their soul or something and trapped them in the dark aether and you probably have to fight him or something to get out
As long as there is no amour plates
Great trailer, game’s still gonna suck
Is he the commentator and the skulls in the cages are insta-kills. He kind of has that voice imo
the cowboy is kinda like the shadow man from bo3
"welcome to Ashes of the Damned. Population, well, less than yesterday"
That was clean. Whole sequence 3:27
The villain might be Walton goggins for the voice actor
MILO!!!! The cowboy zombie looks like the toy zombie in the ORIGINS END CUT SCENE!! Could there be a correlation between them???
He look like one of those infected from i am legend 😂
8 player zombies?
Doesn't even look like cod zombies anymore man it's like a left 4 dead clone with rounds
Looks like nothing more than a cinematic trailer. I hate how they release these pointless trailers
I'm so glad that I was wrong and the new villain wasn't just the shadowman or Kortifex.
Jebediah Brown?
Could the new villain be Rodolfo?
Negan walking dead?
ITS JEBEDIAH BROWN !!!!!!!!!!!!
Still hate that they got rid of the bus.
Cool cinematic But we all know unless it’s classic zombies it’ll flop. I’ll take another BO4 even if I can’t get another BO3
More BS stories just so far gone at this point
I just wanna say, I really appreciate you focusing on on Nikolai's sick ass gun flip, I was legit watching that part repeatedly because of how sick it was.
1:34 Richtoffen was actually scared
That hat badge is civil war emblem ish
I think the new villain will be something like "The Sherrif" or "Cavalryman" or "Horseman" and will be very similar to the Warden from Alcatraz
All right so when I saw this for the first time initially I actually could not believe it and it got me really pumped up but I just know call of duty going to drop the ball
Knock off Walton Goggins ghoul.
All the people are saying he’s voiced my Walton goggins I’m pretty sure it isn’t
We got M Shadows as a Zombies Villain
I know they already confirmed all 8 characters are playable on all maps but maaan i really hope on one of the maps were get some sort of 8 player experience that would be sick
Man that had fucking Aura that looks great!
NGL that is a pretty sick into 🫡
Guys, hear me out: the double tap guy is the villain
Is on a egg on blackops6 you need to now
the villian sounds like Jebediah Brown from buried creator of the pack of punch and son of the witch in buried as well. Its crazy imagine if its him
Is that jebediah?
Why you glazing this unknown basic villain when none of them tried shooting him off the rip that is some bs. Anyone can make sh** Shine But its still Sh**
If only the gameplay can match the cinematography. Cuz boy this actually looked good. I’ll preorder if zombies is peak. I dealt with bo3, trash campaign, mid multiplayer, and great zombies. And that alone carried that game
this looks so bad. Ngl I have been so done with zombies. I can't pay $80 For a game when I'll just play zombies and be disappointed
bear zombies?
DEI Zombies so bad they had to forced OG Zombies cast into the story.
The crossbones on the bad guys hat kinda gives me Deresurrectionist vibes
Homemade is always the best cookies
shouldve kept the glasses on
Jeddiah brown
If we get an 8player zombies that would be EPIC!!!!
Jebediah Brown?
Fucking hell, always, ALWAYS! I think eh I’m not gonna be serious about this new Zombies chapter. I know imma be disappointed. Then they cook in a cinematic and get my hopes up yet again
Even though it’s like kinda messed up, but I like how the new group and old group were like echoes from the past with their background. Carver and Dempsey; The Americans. Weaver and Nikolai; The Russians. Gray and Richtofen; The Europeans. Maya and Takeo; The POCs.
Their eyes changed color, threw me off.
could be the guy who built packa punch, sounds like him
THE SYMBOL ON HIS HAT IS CONFEDERATE CAVALRY, HES CIVIL WAR ERA CAVALRY MAN HOW DO PEOPLE NOT RECOGNIZE THE SYMBOL
That symbol on his hat is a Cav scout symbol from the US Army.
Richtofen wit a geekbar, Nichtofen
Here we go they going to hype this up get excited the game drops it’s fun for like 1 month then they hate it and the dlcs come out and they love or hate it but yea glad I’m not the only one to think FO show
Looks better than any BO6 marketing
Battlefield
the ghoul to me the first time I saw the trailer made me think of Jason Hudson
shadow man verient
I'm intrigued and not at the same time. I'd be excited if I didn't already know that Activision funds the shit out of trailers.
perhaps the buried guy who made the Pack a Punch (im onto absolutely nothing)
The Shadowman was a better villain
Sounds like Jeffrey Dean Morgan
nah i'm good
Seems like it’s jebediah brown
"Who TF are you?"   The Ghoul: "You can call me The Ghoul."
WTF is The Ghoul doing in CoD.... SMH
THIS HAS TO BE THE DUDE THAT MADE THE PACK A PUNCH IM TELLING YOU
This shit is ass
So could he be the guy that took Ava from Mw3? We have all the evidence with what he can do and how the anomaly took Ava. I’m saying it’s obvious unless shadow man is still alive.
Milo, when you said I'm a big, bad scary man. You sounded like Adam Sandler.
Hopefully the Shadowsmith is the announcer and they don’t reuse the forsaken
1:44 nah legit thought the exact same thing !!!!!
Might be the warden
Hmm...I say making a trailer look good isnt that difficult. Gameplay tells the tale. I just had my friend send me that all excited. I tried MW3 zombies on the free weekends and it was so boring and underwhelming. I never was a fan of zombies after the first game because I hated the feeling of tight confined space running. I gave 3 a chance and was disappointed. The only zombies I ever truly liked was cold war. I havent purchased a COD for about 16years and I definitely wont be purchasing just for zombies unless its like an updated expanded cold war
jadediah brown? Shadow smith ! Hmmm
Is ashes of the dammed the name of the map?
bros glazing so hard, i wonder how much they paid him
this is the dude from the end of MWZ ee, the shadow figure
They are either hiding something good or pulling out legs again please be the first one
00:36 How though? Like intentionally? You complete these EE's for a living.
Ultimus vs Tommy toughknuckles
Icl, the shadowsmith literally overshadowed EVERYONE in this intro damn.
Disclaimer: big ears
4:20 my hypocrisy theory is that this is Jebediah Brown because like how it said he’s trying to bring back the old Multiverse so the thing about it is that he’s trying to go back to the time he set foot on purgatory point. In BO2 4:20
We back we back we black!!!!
It’s gonna crack it’s gonna crack it’s. Going to crack boiiiis💪💪💪💪💪
“Give us some destructive environments” pffff hahaha COD wised it had any of the physics or potential of THE FINALS TELL EM SCOTTY 🗣️🗣️🗣️
More than 4 characters?
He sounds like the guy from buried that made all the machines
Is that Jebediah brown the guy who built the pack a punch black ops 2 in the underground map
Am I crazy or does that sound like Troy baker?
Failing to be excited over this. Why on Earth was this not just the final cutscene on the Reckoning? Would’ve had far more impact. What a mess this is honestly
Why is everyone excited about this broke back zombies journey ever since the conception of Warzone the series as a whole lost the plot
Gameplay has to impress and no armour plates and 100000 boss zombies and points system to reverted to the old way points per shot rather than per kill
Let's go
Jebidiah Brown
milo i literally own that shirt
07:18 this guy can hear stuff from Milos away
Cod zombies in 2025 OMEG LUL
The guy is Udo Lindenberg
Hope he also brings back the og pack a punch machine. Fuck the forge...
if only they make games as good as their trailer.
I’m gonna have to politely disagree. Liberty was cool, but this shit is peak
Those skulls are dr month and the shadow man. Nah idk
Bringing back the old crew still feels like nostalgia bait this is gonna be ass
Jebediah brown?
COD should just drop multiplayer and campaign  and strictly do zombies
Gonna wait on it. Was hyped for bo6 zombies stopped giving COD the benefit of the doubt.
Jebediah Brown?
Maybe the sheriff from town?
Bro sounds like ZED from BL series lol
Too bad I ain't getting this game
clint Eastwood!!!!!
I don’t care abt zombies another shitty gamemode for camo grinde
I could watch hours of this. But these short videos probably take so long to make
WTF .. you didn't even break it down. Like wtf
Im sure the AI they used just directly ripped the fallout ghoul from the tv series, cadence, style, take away his nose and it would be the exact same. BUT BUT BUT HES WEARING A CIVIL WAR HAT HE IS DIFFERENT. This looks like more vanguard zombies story beat slop. Oh zombies? just magic now. Don't worry about it all you gotta do is fight the boss consumer
Logo its fucking trash they MUST change  also cover looks like some fucking seasonal key art you know what i mean they looks the same every season… iam disappointed tbh all that shitty bo cold war story are now connected to original crew bruh they just ruining old crew i don’t like it
That trailer is amazing even nikolai zombie shot looking forward to slaying zombies 👍
Idk watafaq is happening. I'm lost
Could this be... OLD JEBIDIAH BROWN, THE BLACKSMITH?!?!? THE CREATOR OF THE PACK A PUNCH MACHINE?!?!?!? I always wondered what happened to him after purgatory point got transferred to Africa and became buried.
His face kinda looks like Leroy's ngl
When I saw him for the first time I thought it was Adler 😂
Because it is Walter Goggins
its dempsey’s dad
Anyone eles think the cowboy guy is the black Smith that made pap?
I just had a thought, what if when the shadow smith took Ava, he took her to the past when ex requiem is still alive and altering the time line and canceling out their deaths, but now that I’m reading my own comment it sounds silly I don’t even know why I’m commenting this, it was just some random thought I had
Horrible. Zombies is dead. And that DEI 🤮
Yo lowkey why does the guy in the cowboy hat sound like the voice from liberty falls gameplay trailer
Is that not the dude from buried? That built the pap machine
I don’t know if this is just wishful thinking, but maybe this event could “remove” takeo’s ability to speak, giving an in-world reason why takeo is mute now (I know there is a voice actor for him, but that could just be grunts and moans when you get hit or something)  Also the scene of carver getting saved by richtofen was nice, as carver was richtofens #1 hater coming into janus towers, so some character development might happen there
Return of buried??
If only multiplayer was this good🥹🥹
i’m sorry man not spending 70ish quid for zombies
They actually cooking with this one, but we still don’t know how it will look on release
Now this is something with substance. It will be nice to have an actual protagonists again.
Other than me repeatedly saying it’s Daniel Craig and it is! He’s probably the zombie equivalent of death right given we know where four of these charcters end up logic dictates this might not end well for some of these guys and given they’ve cast wildly a big name and everything gonna be safe to say he’s definitely going to ripperino some of these guys crew…. But yes it’s Daniel Craig despite all the goggins right now lol
Bruh. Why hype up bringing them back, IF YOU ARE GINNA KILL THEM IMMEDIATELY WTF  Edit: oh they are all getting smoked by the fallout ghoul ok  Edit 2: yeah that’s a weirdcore ass logo but that sums up all of modern zombies so whatever. I just hope they make it fun to play and get rid of the weapon tier systems.
Eh, not a fan of the nostalgia bait there was no need for it and plus it's a cgi trailer, we all know they're going to release like 1-2 good maps and the rest will be crap.
we'll see on the 30th i still don't like it
A cowboy sheriff? So fucking lame.
is it just me or does dempsey kinda look like jon bernthal?
I'm getting mad Mephistopheles vibes from him. . .
Just cant bring myself to get excited for cgi trailers anymore 😕
Please get Milo to see this yall!!  White eyes? We've only seen this in alpha and omgea.  Maybe connected to the lingering richtophen in that map?.  Also just hit me  8 players and white eyes??  Yall i think this guy was in the past universe in some way or another..
jeb brown?
The logo is very zombies in spaceland vibe which is very out of place for this trailer.  They still aren't getting a penny til they deliver in their promises.
No Russian vibes. If you know you know
So what? Theyre on a mission to retrieve their souls now?
Buried map all over again. Hope we get the giant too
Honestly I’m impressed they need a show or movie
i'm sure it's gonna be some lone ranger type guy
If only they were as good at making zombies as they are at making dope trailers
Walton Goggins was the first thing I thought of too😭
That looks like a civil war/post civil war Calvary slouch hat
Game looks vary cool ngl but it’s going to be ruined by the modern macanics like bo6 I liked bo6 at is core the Castile map was my fav but it’s all the bs in between like the ai all of that stuff
Hes from buried
Looks hype, still ain't buying tho
This is stupid
It’s Daniel craig….
If this means we’re getting a proper western map (that’s not underground) color me hyped
That voice for Nikoli Doesn't sound like the original VA. If it isn't, holy missed opportunity. Might just be trippin tho
We on some Metal Gear shit
his face reminds me of brutus
Even if he isn't the Shadow Man, I'd like to see some touches into SOE (& hopefully, a reimagined SOE map).  I absolutely crave novelty, AND elements will crossover...With the prior being said, the original WW, original Chicago-esque map, and interesting antagonist this trailor is selling the launch map for sure.   I'm looking forward to brand new lore, zombie enemies, and overall dynamics to the map that will anchor us to the experience. I really do hope they knock it out of the park with this iteration.
Its the guy who made the pack a punch milo... Jebediah Brown. He's a texus cowboy who got tricked into making the pack a punch for the shadow man and has become the new shadow man. He takes the souls of the living for his army of the dead in the dark aether. (There's going to be evil versions on primis) and the white eyes I think are to represent purgatory. Been suck between life and death. (Which is a cool blood of the dead reference maybe after life is back) 😂
I literally thought of the ghoul from fallout show 😭
4:53 LMFAO you're hilarious
The way their souls left gave me Mortal Kombat vibes
Is the new protagonist the same voice as the double tap gobblegum machine? I could be way off.
Bro I said the same thing ab Walton goggins lmao
looks like a new operator skin to me nice !!!
”He sucks Eva through the mirror” is a crazy thing to hear out of context 🤣
The first thing I thought of when I saw the dude was that it was the guy from Fall Out. Same style clothing, voice, and appearance.
Thats definitely walter goggins
They really brought the Ghoul from fallout. Thats how bad they are reaching now.
I'd tempted to play bo6 or 7 if they were not always online
Trash game, nostalgia cash grab nonsense. Same bo6 garbage mechanics.  Cant wait for ugly png of each chars face on the screen
9:57 POLSKA GUROM!
This cutscene is so BO3, sets up everything, and ends how the map begins. Nice shot on the crew preparing to take on the threat
Jebadiah brown???
will bo7 be the year we start round 1 with takeo sword
The Undead vs The Dead
Now im kind of sad we didnt get carry forward for guns at the very least. I wanted to hear the voice lines for all the different weapons from the original crew.
The shadow smith cowboy looks like Adler. I KNOW THEY ARE DIFFERENT PEOPLE but for some reason he looks like Adler with the face definitions and the wrinkles with the glasses too. I can’t unsee it
Buried vibes ?
One thing I don’t like about Milo is how much he complains ,even if they gave us a “PERFECT” Map or cut scene he would still find a way to complain about something, I enjoy DalekJD he always has a positive attitude with new content and knows how to hold the developers accountable when they don’t get things right
Looked like a dead by daylight trailer
The skulls could be monty and shadowman
I mean realistically it's just gonna be more soulless crap. This trailer offers nothing except an unidentified villain and the original zombies crew. Who doesn't love the crew? But surely we're going to need more to go off of to get excited like this.
if that guy is monty I'm gonna go crazy
“Aura farming” nah that’s just corny the shadow man was straight aura
Anyone notice carver speaking as the shadow smith voice in the end?
The characters all have slightly glowing white eyes after skull fed on their souls
just like i called it for BO6, BO7 will be a dead and boring mid game, while everyone over hypes it like usual
Hold up is the logo on his hat the burried logo?
Yee, and I cannot stress this enough .. haw
another character selecting option... which means another mini map another unneeded HUD, another ammo create where u get ammo, another rarity. tryarch is a joke
What if it was the heads of monte and the shadow man
8 player zombies?
Oh perfect the cutscene that has nothing to do with gameplay again. Don’t worry boys it’s trash.
He gives sheriff vibes which could mean that the warden is still yet to be seen?
3:33 that was cool 🔥
This man has Civil war badges, Jeb Brown was born in 1845, civil war happened in 1861. Jeb’s death was never confirmed just audio logged that he got infected, which this man here clearly is due to his warts and hands. Beyond that, Jeb would definitely do something like this after having been the exact reason/cause to the ether breaking loose. He could have been either corrupted or fixing what he started. Without his inventions 935 could have never happened as well
Walton* Goggins and yeah it sounds exactly like him too haha
8 players in outbreak??
Maybe he’s related to the shadow man in a someway?
Daniel Craig???
THE SHADOWMAN IS DEAD GODDAMMIT HE IS DEAD SO HELP ME GOD
8 player zombies
Howdy partner, fetch me them souls
Jebedaiah Brown for sure 🧟‍♂️
“This too shall pass” makes me think he’s Jebediah Brown
its all cavalry. the sword, the emblem on the hat. ghoul from fallout was a cav scout
Look like the transit bus driver😂
Im gonna call it now, were gonna end up using 1 of those skulls at 1 point like the Skull of Nan Sapwe from Zetsubo 😅
Looks like Adler
thats the guy from call duty mobile comics the first 2 yrs
throwing a character with aura baiting gullible fans to buy the game too bad I'm not that gullible aint buying this shit again
Is it Jedidiah brown?
He looks more like John Cassidy from Fallout 2 than he does The Ghoul
Now all we need is one of these for every map and we’re golden
The old man is shadow smith from mw3 zombies
It's Walton
I’m so exited for this game now.. a new, interesting and cool villain is what the story needed
All this was supposed to be part of bo6
Probably won't be a great zombies iteration but that cutscene was dope.
Am I the only one that sees rust man in the top left in the poster
Is that Jebediah? The creator of the pack a punch???
At this point they just come up with random shit in the story
No link to the original?
Okay but what happened with Richthofen or Maxis?
He just used the skull of nansapwe
Why does the shadow warden sound like boothill from Star rail.
I can't lie, the new villain is pretty cool
it looks like he has a different verison of the skull from zetsubou. makes the same sounds and everything
I thing he's Jeb Brown the pack a punch inventor.
Finally some mystery !
I wonder if he didn’t drain their souls the zombies might now have attacked them
The Aura of this sentient Zombie dude is so cold, damn
Looks ass call of duty needs to go back to its roots
The logo should have been Gray smokey western style imo
The shadow smith is a famous actor I can’t put my finger on the actors name but he has portrayed a sheriff multiple times in movies with the same likeness if anyone could help me out that would be much appreciated
I really hope the COD Zombies franchise gets a straight up standalone game series and ALL the attention it truly deserves.
The only thing that can be hype about call of duty is zombies and Activision will never understand
Jebediah Brown
I think he is the cult leader
The symbol looks very similar to a US Confederate Calvary seen on their hats, which fits into the time period of Jebediah Brown.
watching to this version so i dont have to give the real trailer a view
Where's my trucker hat?
I wish I was still as hyped as he is
I dont know if its just me but I truly cannot be asked to care about any trailer at this point. The entire time im looking at the choppy ass blurry background wondering if human hands touched any of it. I just have no faith in trailers anymore at all
Delete the "diversity" and I'm in.
4:29 "The Black Rider"! Wait, I mean "Silver-Balls"! Hmm... Sawyer???
i know nobody cares but before bo6 came out i was guessing how they were trying to make the new characters very similar to our old team, and in this trailer they literally showed it ahahah!  maya is like takeo, the sword/knife wielder.  carver is a soldier like dempsey.  weaver is the leader, pre sure you know who that is.  and elizabeth is the unpredictable or smart one idk what to put here hahaha, but like nikolai lmao
this is totally jeb brown
Idk man, all i really get from this is new antagonist and team kills zombies. Nothing really groundbreaking
honestly gonna sit out of playing this one during the easter egg findings, gonna watch the whole thing instead like i should have been doing since bo3
Bad
This definitely got me interested a lil bit but the next one gotta top this 6:21
I hate what bo6 did to the zombies storyline, but these cinematics look incredible
On the date screen on the top right near his eye that looks like one of the vampires from dead of the night
This dude sounds like Jebediah. Just saying.
Yoooooo is this playable!
L zombies
I’m sorry but how had Milo not seen the ending yet?
Really I’m excited
Bro be talking so dam fast 😂
new villain looks sick. Also tip, maybe next time have chat and alerts off the screen. Sometimes im wtching the cinematic with you as the first time and that really takes away from the experience.
It's totally  richtofen
That's Crazy 8 players zombies
Enough with the gaslighting bro, this is a cutscene and has nothing to do with the quality of anything.
It would’ve been so cool if that happened to be Jedediah Brown
Its certainly not the GK intro but hopefully this game will be good
the emblem on his hat kinda reminds me of the bo2 zombies level emblems
He HAS to be Jeb Brown
The man who made pack a punch
Jeb Brown maybe. (creator of pack a punch)
So nobody’s thinking of a cowboy Hudson?
Prediction, that gunslinger man is Jebbadiya calling it now!
The lack of dialogue concerns me
Shadowsmith/Brutus
The skull sounded like the skull from zetsubu no shima 😮
I like the idea of him being Jebediah Brown
Cinematic is gonna be better than the actual game.
That looks crazy I can’t wait!! Lol
Ngl I’m just gonna name my character “Walter Goggins” on my next FNV play through😂
This the Blacksmith from Buried?
straight fkn aura farming 😭
Nothing burger cutscene..
I like the idea that somebody said that it was Jebediah the creator of the pack of punch
And now after 7 years we're essentially just back to the Aether storyline, nice
Bro pretty much said “Fetched me their souls” and actually did it
Who is replace Tom Kane for Takeo????
I ducking knew it was the guy from buried
Aren't those raptor one's sunglasses???? And doesn't he too speak in a southern accent?
Nope. Definitely Not interested anymore. BF6 officially for me this year
They screwed up. This is obviously the exposure to aetherium, but it’s not Strauss with them. It’s Maya
damn it gets more and more dumb as cod goes! bring back origins mob of the dead town nacht and other fun round based shit with maybe some easter eggs.
Looks just like the guy from the mirror in modern warfare zombies at the end of
The crossed swords on his hat is US Army Cavalry
Its not the shadow man or theyre butchering his character
Good cinematic but I'm not getting excited yet. I've been hurt too many times 😢
Looks cool. But we all know theyll frag it up as usual 🙄
Wait wait wait,,, Are we Back to 8 Player Teams? That will be so Tuff!!
Thank goodness I pre-order Battlefield 6.
100 looks like the guy from fallout
8 player matches could be done so easily if they weren’t still making CoDs for Ps4…
Please let this zombies be good , or at least bring back bo3 vibes
Any entire 16 words are said by the crew in this whole cutscene. Shits just turning into a Micheal Bay movie at this point.
Know we like to shit on cod but damn that was a good trailer and the baddie was cool as fuk with a great voice. Makes it worse tho that u just know the gameplay and design is festered with warzone mechanics. 😔
8 player zombies!
He gives me Higgs from Death Stranding vibes lol
Seeing people theorizing what if the shadow smith is jeb brown the guy who created the pack a punch from the old timeline so I'ma need a video on that lol
they actually managed to give someone aura and its some random villain
Is it possible that those are dr Monty's and the shadowman's skulls?
If it’s not Jebediah Brown and there isn’t some refrence to Buried somehow I will be SO mad
I wanna believe that the group became Revenants due to having a portion of their souls taken and devoured by this pseudo sheriff, hence as why their skin became ash grey and their eyes becoming a glowing grey color.
Lost the opportunity for him to say, "Fetch me their souls!!"
Collection of souls? Crew forced into a quest to free their souls from being imprisoned in the dark aether?  Could this guy be the person responsible for mob?
Huh I actually like this new villian, reminds me of the borderlands 3 narrator for the bounty of blood DLC. Really looking forward to this especially with the returning characters. I hope Treyarch redeems themselves this year!
This made me so happy to see I love how they are taking a chance on something new, this peeks my interest heavy, I like ghoul vibes or negan from TWD!! The logo looks like zombies in space land, I’ve seen better but it’s cool and lastly I thought it was big Jeb as well.
Getting WW2 zombies vibes
WALTON GOGGINS GOT ZOMBIE GOGGLES ?!?
It seems like the cutscene is cut short before it zooms out to show the map ...
3:21 possible hint at a “press *button* to drop weapon” feature? It would be sick to be able to drop your gun for someone else without buying another one
I wanna know what happened to the tranzit crew so bad.
Still buying battlefield
That trailer looks awesome af, it definitely makes me wanna get the game
Dbd normal slinger ahh build
I’m lowkey dissapointed it’s not Monty, but I have high hopes for this new guy. I really hope his final boss fight/arena has something to do with Buried.
He is probably just a new characters but if it is an existing character from the previous story, I can only think of one western character and that's the guy who created the PaP
He’s holding the two “skulls”, would it be fair to say the one skull had a lighter smoke color than the other?
Is that the guy from mw3 zombies?
Its the creator of the pap j. brown from purgatory point
shadow cowboy....we better get a cowboy wonder weapon
It's Samantha Maxis
STOMP! not STAMP huge diffrence milo
I'm going call it and say our cowboy is ex air cavalry or at lease some type of ex military person.
Western Vecna 😂
If they are gonna try bringing stuff back could the Shadowsmith be Jebediah Brown
Wait, WAIT PAUSE, remember when Eddie says “at least I’ve a SOUL” to which SAM replies to Eddie “out of all things you’ve told me, are you sure about that?”, so does SAM knows??? That shadow smith stole their souls??
You’re telling me you’ve still not watched the reckoning ending cutscene? Aren’t you a zombies YouTuber?
The eyes remind me of the witch lady in the buried map. She wasn't a zombie but maybe a ghost spirit witch. Just a thought
Definitely seems like he uses something similar to the Skull of Nan Sapwe. But he only uses one of them, so I have to imagine that the other skull is meant to “give” souls instead of take. And it may be more important to theorize who the skulls belong to rather than who the man is (most likely Jebodiah or possibly a version of the Shadow Man that was reincarnated in this new universe as a western character, and he learns about his past life after getting sucked into the dark Aether. Who knows? But that’s a good thing!!)
4:50 you missed the chance to say new sheriff in town...its ok your not American.
It's either Jeb Brown or some random we will learn about.
Bro the way Richtofen got yeeted out the window after the zombie’s bomb blew whereas the others casually jumped out the window 😂 edit-that logo is god awful.
ngl the only thing that would make me care about zombies anymore is zombies chronicles 2, cod so out of touch with the community
So weve had the blue and yellow eyes, white in this version?
if paramount and cod worked on a zombies movie animated like this id be so happy
Looks Like 3 UniversesMeeting Together OR He Will Be Guiding Them Through The Zombie Battle/ Universe
Voice sounds like jebodiah brown.
Cowboy walked down them stairs swinging his johnson 😂
JEBODIAH BROWN IS BACK GUYS, ITS NOT WEST VIRGINIA ANYMORE !!!!!!!
I’m so hype for bo7 it’s insane
I’m 35. Passing on the never ending story of randomness
He is exactly the same character from fallout 4 what a coincidence the one from the game in campaign you got to find them in diamond City😅
Bro it’s Leroy
let the game die
Wasnt the dude that made the agarthan device and pack a punch from a midwest town?
Is it just me or does the villain have a striking similarity to Russel Adler? I hope they are not putting any more campaign characters at random in the story...
Sunglasses in DARK ether is wild
Is it just me, or does the cowboy guy look like some form of a different Richtofen?
I can’t lie this is fucking hype
Oh man I haven't started the video yet and I know you're gonna hate on it. Just go play Destiny 2 man.
That cutscene was pretty good and entertaining, just not sure if this will bring me back.
He’s dressed as a Cavalry Scout, I know because I used to be one. New generation obviously. But the logo on his hat are sabers, also looked like he had a saber on his side.
Shadowsmith sounds like he’s voiced by Troy Baker, hella reminiscent of Higgs from Death Stranding. Guess he thought Nolan North was lonely lol
Dbd deathslinger type boss
He's a Soul Collector 😏 I wonder who else's souls he has? Maybe Victis crew and we can release them down the line?
He's a Soul Collector 😏 I wonder who else's souls he has? Maybe Victis crew and we can release them down the line?
milo content is mid these days, we know you have zero interest in cod but you still make content about it
Jeb Brown???
This is already setting up to be amazing! Can’t wait to play as our og crew!
Can you please yell louder
buried vibes tbh
Was thinking of the Zetsubo no Shima Skull tbh
It definitely gives me like a buried evil type of vibe. This is a far-fetched question. I can't help but think about the guy that put his wife in the Packer punch machine. And she became the witch and buried, could that be him forgot his name.?????????
If it has outbreak I may pick it up? Undecided
Imagine we get to play with up to 8 players now that’d be lit💯🔥
But bro they gave us the maps. Litteraly vietnam afganisthan and feudal jaoan from leaks those are their backstories where they were teleported from. So it litteraly, in the blog post.
Leroy !! The new enemy confirmed!!
So I'm gonna take the fact that hes not covering the UNDEAD BEAR attacking the wonder vehicle to mean he knows stuff about it and doesn't wanna speculate on it.
the only thing i didnt like is the lack of voice acting for our ogs, and then also our ogs being at the same level of caught offgaurd as the new bum chars
The fact that Dempsey and takeo didn't talk just makes me scared I can't imagine Dempsey without Steve
Shadowsmith...western wear...return to Buried is probably the last map for bo7 lol
I think it’s the dude that made the pack a punch. Jebodiah Brown. It sound exactly like him from the radio
That ear condition is called cauliflower ear, which is deformation due to trauma (getting hit repeatedly)
When Nikolai said “Hell pigs” I legit lost my shit. Like HE SAID THE THING!
Only thing I think is missing is a badass song with the fight. (There are guitar riffs but more than that).
christ man, everything about black ops makes me not want to buy it and then this happens and im sucked back into zombies, Gamepass it is then
Has to be jeb still lol
Remember, Liberty Falls had a good cinematic and it was pretty mid
Is this Mr Peeks ?
Wtf went from black ops zombies to damn walking dead whispering to zombies ? wtf💀💀💀
I think its jeb brown resurected
Look who decided to come back around zombies lol😊
Honestly, I think bo7 zombies might be the only reason to play bo7 for. Although this cinematic is great and all, it’s until we see the map and gameplay itself, so it’s best to keep some low expectations until then.
Honestly I dig it.
The cowboy guy sounds like the guy who made the pap in the og story line.
You’re chatting shit! As if you said you haven’t seen the Reckoning ending.
Sorry but the big bad being a super trooper, not that cool.
The skull are soul sucking and that could be Jebediah fianly
I'm sorry bruz you gotta stay here don't wanna see bl4 or battlefield videos 😅
What if....Shadow Man and Monty Dragon Ball fused into a cowboy?
What if he’s the owner of the farm from tranzit 😂
Zombies will never be the same until they go back where you start with a pistol and don’t get a class and start with assault rifle just dumb if they continue that
1:22 bo2 Hudson With camo?
That crest on his hat is the Black Ops 2 Zombies Ranking badge!
"This too shall pass" is a line of dialogue that Samuel J Stuhlinger says during the "Mined Games" main Easter Egg Quest in Buried
Cut scene definitely looks cool, but I will not be fooled. Let’s not forget in Black ops six they didn’t even bother doing intro cut scenes for the back half.
8 player zombies?
this cut scene is amazing I just think its funny how he says I know you are all confused because its like does he really have to explain that they are confused. most of this was really sick I just notice they keep doing that like in the first railer people saying none of this is real and just common sense things they should leave up to interpretation to surprise you later on as you put together the story. like were not dumb and that makes younger people smarter when they have to figure out things. maybe im cherry picking but it was a big issue in bo 6 for me.
So how is it they can make a cinematic that is visually stunning and exciting and then actually deliver cold pizza?
THIS IS GOATED. If they had thrown an avenged sevenfold song over the back, that would’ve been origins quality
Milo, you can change the speed of a video by pressing SHIFT + > or < instead of opening the options tab. Thought it might be useful
The Two Swords on the man's hat is from the American cavalry
First thoughts fallout guy
God i hate that they keep getting me but that's the best intro cutscene in YEARS.
Well...nice we didnt see any new gameplay or map footage for the new map. Cool villain but disappointing trailer. Bo7 feels like bo6 2.0. I was hoping we'd get a new software change that separates its self from bo6 but we will see 🤷🏾. Doesn't feel like it!
I’ve been checked out of zombies since they canceled season 2 of bo4, is the og crew back?!
Crazy shot in the dark but each new (returning) character has a related poi. Nacht for Richthofen, the sunken town for Dempsey, the Ascension type for Nikoial, and an ancient Japanese location for Takeo.
Let it play the trailer first, then talk
So glad  im done with 5his franchise
I’m so happy after seeing this hey!!!!! Looks like we are BACK!!!
Like how BO6 zombies or not. This cut scene is amazing, and gets me, at the very least, excited for Bo7 zombies
Maybe the skulls he carries are the shadow man's and Dr. Monty's skulls and he's harnessing their power. Hence, them being locked in the cages. It's just a theory.
So glad this game is on Gamepass pray the zombies are good bc we know multiplayer is fucked
They can make peak cinema but can’t fix the game 😂😢
Whats crazy is the 2 zombie heads. 4 Souls in 1 and 4 souls in the other or whatever was taken lol
So what’s gonna happen now, will Ava be in this? We seen her get dragged in by a similar cowboy hatted character, also looks like the same hands that dragged her in.
why do i feel like this is going to be a 8 player easter egg....
I thinks it’s the cowboy that made the pap machine
Milo: I played BO7 zombies  BUT this is my first time reaction to BO7 zombies 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I wonder if he has any ties to "Buried" due to his thematic outfit and accent...
When he said “this too shall pass” i knew this was goin be ass af
glad for this dead by daylight collab.  wasn’t expecting the deathslinger to be the main antagonist of bo7 zombies lol
i thought of jebediah brown too, matching with the sunking city audio, the '800 cowboy style and the fact that he said that he was confused at the beginning
That skull sucking there souls really reminds me of the skull of nan sapwe from Zetsubou
Season one gonna be 🔥
It looks good but I’m seriously checking out on CoD Zombies this year. I hope it’s everything the zombies players want/need. Our community has been kicked to the curb ever since BO3 finished up. Now they just see us as the extras to fill their wallets. Peace out to you all and hope you enjoy the shitshow that is Black Ops 7.
Am i the only one that thinks we are missing a few seconds form the last scene, like a big reveal of the map
Is it just me but I feel like the intro cutscenes weren’t this good in bo6, maybe bo6 was filler. Hopefully.👀
The symbol on his hat looks like the dual bones you have on bo2 zombies as you level up
Tf2 engine voice actor
Remember: CoD puts a lot more effort into marketing than to actually making the game. This trailer is flashy but otherwise mostly just a meaningless action sequence. I do not have high hopes for zombies based off of this.
I think the country dude is Jebediah Brown from buried. The guy who put his mother in the damn PaP machine.
Okay so wanna say, he’s definitely got more of a Rick grime vibe than people are willing to admit, and it’s most likely jebadiah brown from the moment when buried was teleported
Thank you for uploading Milo I appreciate you ❤
Please let the classic point system return, please let there be no loadouts, please don’t let all the weapons be almost the same dps, please don’t let there be rarities, please let their be shield instead of armor, everything else not even a big problem
Dempsey not being the one to say  "and who the fuck are you" doesnt feel right to me I did enjoy the trailer tho ngl
We are so not back 😂
The animation team did great. At least they're doing their jobs.  Keep in mind: Activision DON'T make these cinematics.  This always happens. Great teaser, huge let-down upon release.
we, yes we aint buyin it
God I hope Samantha is still alive and shows up at some point in the maps.
He looks like leroy from buried
They once again smashed the trailer, its something I can always give them props for. But not matter how cool this trailer is, I cant bring myself to be excited by it, cause I already have an idea of what lies behind it, bland babified gameplay systems that stales the gameplay loop and is just Black Ops 6 with a fresh coat of paint on the maps...  Until they remove the plating system that turns you into a juggernaught, loadouts that ruin the gameplay and just there to stop warzone camo grinders from crying cause apparently box spinning is a fate worse than death despite the BO4 grind being fine... killstreaks and field upgrades that are just constant get out of jail cards (this is more an issue with what some of the field upgrades do and not the system in general, theres a reason everyone runs shroud, guard or heal and not dark flare or energymine but killstreaks need to just go, I would rather have the BO4 specialist weapon system than field upgrades and killstreaks, more balanced and engaging with how you would level them up...
He sound like tf2 sniper 😮
Are we back? It feels like we’re back
By any chance is it jebadia from buried bo2 and does this connect to mw3 zombies endscene
At first I thought the western guy was Dempsey at first … But , on another note ….Aye Carver is fucking hilarious bro...
A theory I have is the two skulls he’s holding could be shadow man and dr Monty
Isn´t the new villain Jason Hudson from bo1 and bo2? He looks like him.
This looks so mid
This villain could be shadowman level, he has so much potential bro
"welcome to the family son" ahh villain
I bet he’s the excuse to make a buried remaster
This feels like an OG cinematic, like The Giant. Where  it just goes into them fighting the zombies instead of some BS.
Thanos vibes lol
they done added the ghoul from fallout show 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
Willing to bet that every cinematic in game will not be this good at all
I had to stop watching halfway through because honestly dude I don't like watching this guy anymore.
What if this is another version of shadow man like they are doing a version of Kang in the marvel world so now they are just doing variants
You know zombies is going to be the best part of bo7
NAH EVERYONE KEEP 💩’n on B07 how y’all been all yr don’t come over now ‼️🗣️
NOT MY ZOMBIES without the actors. If they go into another year of zombies without getting back the actors I'm gonna have to pass. It's so soulless without the voice cast. They can only get so far by reusing the grunts and lines from previous sessions.
So I think it's safe to assume that if people are being pulled from different time periods by this Ghoul could've been pulled from the Old West?  Also his eyes look just like our Crew after he sucks off their souls so maybe he got his soul sucked out and after countless time spent in the Dark Aether maybe he just started feeding off new arrivals to stay alive?
I miss it when other studios had their own interpretation/twist on zombies. Not just trayarch… I hope sledgehammer and infinity ward make there own zombies
I’m watching this because I like milo and just to see how far we’ve fallen.
8 MAN CO OP????
HAS ANYONE NOTICED THE VICTUS CREW ZOMBIES
no thanks cod is dead..
Bro sounds like the Engineer from tf2
Better not be another year of getting perks as dlc features instead of being apart of the base game
theres a lot of sucking when it comes to zombies
I’ve seen a theory some where that he could jebediah brown
Cant wait to have none of this effort after launch
thats just arthur morgan
If its still easy and with CW/BO6 mechanics nothing about this is hype
Arthur Morgan?😂
Its Dennis Riffle
Please be good, please..
New villain and i already love him he's awesome!!! 🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Trailer was kinda mid.
What if they are pirats in the dark aether he got that pirate sword on his side
Okay this feels like the perfect time for a Buried remake now with this cowboy villain as the big BO7 baddie
The cowboy sherif almost looks like arthur on buried just not a giant anymore
That would be cool if it's Jeb Brown!
Boooooo
JEBADIAH BROWN FROM BURIED
The shadowsmith is for sure a Highwayman from the 1800s west. Possible buried tie-in?
It’s the beginning of September ends !
That guy gives me buried vibes.
Didn't you get invited to treyarch to play this already? How come you're acting like this is all new? Lol
Anyone else think they could bring buried back as well? I mean dudes a literal old western sheriff. Seems like a missed opportunity if not.
soooo, 8 player zombies?
Its the guy who created the pack a punch machine same voice same manner trust me thats him and i think that guy was someone we thought was good but if you remember his backstory its tragic and i think he is a version on him that is trying to bring back his wife from the angels above the keepers it only makes sense we never knew who he was but he was a big part on creating the agarthan device and also 1 of the first people to see hear and follow the keepers before everyone else he was from 1800-1700 just a theory
Also noticed zombie bear in the logo lol
Go back to eddie and Samantha playing with the dolla and one doll its the man in the back
Imagine it’s jeb brown
Dude looks like hes out of Apocalypse Now
Shadow smith or joeish sheim
I don’t actually think it’s him, but the western dude’s face looks like Leroy from Buried. He also says “I know you’re confused, so was I” which from the lore he would be confused from transporting to Buried, but I doubt it’s him. Just coincidence I think.
ghost rider vibes lol
Manifesting DA Victis as the DLC 2 or 3 Main Cast 🤞
The new Shadow Man or the new Doctor Monty
Trash
he (the warden) fed off their souls, it looks like he(the warden) also had his soul eaten because everyone's eyes also started to glow after their souls got eaten. (he is called the warden and brutis is brutis/Archibald/the warden*of*alcatraz**) (Fergeson is just a gaurd for those cells not brutis if anyone's still stuck on that lol) (futhermore in an alt timeline before jason took over there might be a connection between the archibald in the tomb the official spiritual successor to origins la tomb {origins original name in pre-alpha stages} - thegamingrevolution i think was the yt'er that had a video on it))
6:37 it’s literally the hype moments and aura meme, but it’s fire
Just don't get excited no more 😕
looks cool
I think it actually may be Jebediah Brown after all these years. Murdered by zombies now he seems to be undead himself possessing this new power.
Hyping up every map as always. Play the map do the Easter egg age then we’re bored. Stop hyping up zombies it’s played out
I literally thought the same thing about the cowboy and him looking like the ghoul from the Fallout show
I really hope he's the new announcer
I thought the same thing when I first saw the new bad guy
It’s too bad they ran zombies into the ground by making it warzone. Get armor out of my zombies, I don’t need it to be 20 hits to be downed I want it to be 3-6. I don’t need items to progressively get worse because I have a green version not a gold, I want to pull a gun from the box and be happy because I got the galil and now I’m set for a long time. I don’t need tacticals and custom classes, I need a starting pistol and guns from the wall. It’s not even make zombies great again it’s make zombies half decent again. They think people were enjoying zombies because they had a lot of people on it last year but it was legit just the camp grind that kept that dog shit alive. All due respect Duke Dennis shouldn’t be making it to round 50 with no sense of danger or issue on his first ever play through
Modern mechanics are an automatic pass for me
the way this cowboy talks it's giving Negan talking vibes
So this is what happened? and is the dark ether contamination the crew talked about in MWZ.
Me: hoping to play as Richtofen  Random player next to me: playing as Nicki Minaj 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Is it the Warden … from Blood of the Dead ..??? Or maybe Dr. Monty & the Shadow man  as the one
The cow-boy doesn’t even know who he is himselg
I get excited watching the trailer, then I remember that the mechanics of the game will be the same/similar to BO6 and all my excitement goes away...
Cooper let himself go lol
4:44 so what we got from last year I am still happy I didn't buy a call of duty since mw2 refailer. It's bad when they take from other franchises.
At this point every marketing should end on next week in dragon ball z…… see you next week…. Wow just release the game at this point lol
it must be the guy from the ending of MWZ
If I see shields I’m not playing it
Why do YouTubers always have something to complain about? It’s getting annoying, it’s never good enough…😩
... Ngl 🤔.. lol.. hold uuup 🧐
Shadow Smith is definitely Jebadiah Brown (creator of pack a punch etc)
What of he is the guy trying to bring back the old multiverse the shadow Smith? .... now that I think about it what if Jebbedia Brown became a shadow Smith after he was thrown into the dark ather.
Whooooooooo cares
Monty and shadow man’s skulls in the cages
Bro use the skull of nambabwe of zetsobu no shima
They actually seem like they are trying hard and going somewhere with this (yes I'm delusional)
Ngl the logo is SICKKK  I think your trippin on that , the zombies design looks great the voice acting sounds great, honestly excited for BO7
i love it by they way i hated transit facts
What the heck was that, why was that actually good?
zetsubou no shima had the skull right what if
That dude made the PaP machine
All I ask from treyarch is to actually go through a full game cycle caring about the development of zombies like bo6 citadelle was really enjoyable as well as terminus than they just throw a bunch of garbage it and get everyone uninterested
it has to be some variant of Jeb Brown since that sword is probably Civil War, so dark aether probably got Buried in fold as well
I can already imagine the villain as the announcer, could legitimately be the best announcer we’ve ever had.
It sounds like Walton Goggins… that would be so freaking cool
Here we go again... decent trailer and crappy gameplay. Good luck lads!!!!
Now this should of had been the ending cutscene
Wow you’re a nerd
It won't look like this on console because it's being held back because it's still on last gen
Ancient zombies player, speedrunning collecting all the main casts souls 😱
Honestly best zombies trailer ever they are really aura farming with this one. THE HYPE IS REAL
0:01 Let's see what this B.S. is about
Idk why but this man is giving me buried vibes
100% that new villain is something they thought of recently because you can tell with the writing for BO6 that they didn't know what they were doing or had anything planned.
Great another year of terrible zombies
I feel like the cowboy is Jedediah Brown  Edit: the outfit might be American Civil War cavalry officer uniform
So glad there is a second year of treyarch zombies !
I’m tired of this Mickey Mouse zombies experience, just have one crew or the other, increase the horror element, make it harder to SURVIVE
I will give it to them they do a good job with these trailers but you know it’s gonna be warzone zombies so can’t really get  excited or want to buy it
Ol jeb brown the blacksmith? Maybe
Heavy Fall Our vibes
New zombies announcer
Remember everyone, keep your expectations in line with what BO6 was. If you did not like BO6, you will not like this either.
Doesn’t excite me like u said but it’s raised my expectations from bo7 zombies
Is this Jebediah Brown?
I hope he's an ACTUAL villain this time around
This is going to be mid just like BO6 zombies, the only thing that would make it interesting would be 8 players per match.
That's jebodiah from buried.
This man finessed our souls then left
question for Milo and your crew.. while this VERY much ramps up the hype for BO7Z.. I have timeline continuity questions..   Mainly, we had next to ZERO reference to where Ava (last seen getting pulled into the DA via the mirror in LF during the epilogue cutscene in MWZ) was during BO6.. mainly because of the rewind between MWZ's 2023 and BO6's early to mid 1990's  given the time dilation between the game's real world time and Dark Aether.. the 12 years she's been in the DA would translate into at least a few centuries correct? how much closer will Ava be to her DA Entity twin in terms of power will she be? though to be honest, id recon it might actually be s few levels of magnitude STRONGER..  MWZ was my first real taste of the CoD Zombies universe, and as a solo grinder it was perfect for me.. and what they did for camo grinding in BO6 put me off. but with the MP dark matter and WZ Abyss grinds functionally done.. i want to try and get a better understanding of everything so BO& will make more sense for me
Doesn’t matter if we still have load outs, shields n other bs
Black Ops 6 zombies hype was the only reason I bought the game last year. Liberty Balls and Terminus was fun. Then after that, Treyarch abandoned/stopped supporting the game across zombies, multiplayer, and warzone. As a long time, die hard cod zombie fan, as well as someone who watched Milo over all these years with major easter egg tutorials,etc. I will gladly watch the game through Milo's coverage, but I have no desire to ever play/buy cod moving forward.
Hes got the same eyes that the crew gets after their souls are sucked.
A small detail I noticed:This new character has a cavalry pin on his hat. I really hope we see him on a zombie horse at some point.
Good marketing, but fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me, fool me 3 times eh well im not gen z. 😂
Its the og pack a punch guy, Jebediah Brown
Looks like a cavalry sword, Civil war era maybe.
I think it might be a reverse black ops 3 situation where we go map to map getting 2 peoples souls and its a 8 chjaracter roster and we see them fighting in pair shots in this trailer. The 4 main maps are going to be getting the souls back and then the final map might be him or we might fight the shadow guys each map and the top dog is the 5th maps boss. I hate getting hyped then dissaponited for zombies but the story looks promissing as b06 seems to be a set up for this kinda like infinity war and endgame, sorry if you read this yap 🙏
He got big ears and can hear miles away 😂😂😂 milo
The cowboy dude might be from the ee cutscene at the end of MWZ (the shadow cowboy figure that grabs sam from the mirror) because i don't think we actually figured out who he was.
Steve is definitely returning as Dempsey you can hear it in the grunt he does. Now all we need to know is who is takeo
anything western makes me think of buried, could this be the blacksmith who made the PAP?
Holy Crap Milo! Looks cool. What a trailer!
8:00 “we don’t know if he is evil” 😂 MILO he’s the bad guy 😂
Okay okay wait this was actually really cool! i might buy this cod after all
Next few months boutta be peak with roflwaffles daily videos
I see nothing crazy bro
Ngl I wasn’t really expecting the cutscene too be good but damm 😮
jebediah brown ???? the shadow smith that took ava maybe
until I see more I’m not fucking with this and I hate the wonder vehicle it should just be the bus with Ted I don’t wanna have to upgrade a truck everytime I play it’s gonna get boring fast I don’t feel confident in this being good
im not gonna ignore the zombie bear and the jumper/imp like creature
I know it is cherry picking but I don’t like how the story takes place around the 1990s but suddenly they get transported to a place that still has the 90s ascetics but with future guns because that is what the multiplayer will have.
Wild theory, could be that the guy is a shadow smith working under the shadow man and represents pestilence (one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse) and in every map you’re fighting other horseman until you’re taking on the main big bad
Wow. Trailers great too bad 0 real gameplay or graphics that will be in the game. Game going to be a miss I know it
I think this stuff is cool for marketing but they need some back to basics maps that arent so crazy too part of what built zombies is chill camping slow motion build up to a challenge
Wait... didnt a leak tell us what the plot of bo7 zombies was? Is that his goal? If so, then why? If its Jebidiah then... maybe? He did sound like a holy religious guy when the angels (keepers) came down to chat.
McCain ?
It’s honestly just sad seeing these comments. As soon as the first zombies trailer is dropped, suddenly EVERYONE is excited and is going to be playing the game, even though it’ll be terrible. It’s like they forget this happens literally every year.
Brother you know everything and pretend you don't know you played bo7 zombies. Don't pretend you don't know
Jebediah Brown? 👀
After watching your video yesterday I truly can't tell if you're reactions are real or not and that really bothers me. I wish you never went to do the play test
Clint Eastwood is the main boss!
Before you said anything I was getting Walter Goggins vibes too…
Buried 2 confirmed
That's jeb Brown the creator of the pap machine
yooooo no cap this trailer was badasss
DAMMNN
5:40 he looks like tak from tak and the power of juju
ITS THE WARDEN FROM ALCATRAZ
If only we got the same care for the gameplay
Jebediah Brown? Would be cool
Dude ain't been around zombies in 3 months
This looks so stupid tbh
i thought they said we weren't getting zombies on bo7?
I can see each map being like get the souls back for the original crew kinda like collecting souls in black ops 3 but a parellel
Am I the only one who thinks that Jebediah?
Ngl the original crew of takeo etc just feel thrown in at this point, best way to describe it is they are there just for nostalga and they dont belong there they feel so out of place idk if its just me but thats my opinion
that mfs ear needs pinning 🤣
What if the cowboy is jebadiah brown
Is that Rick grimes? Let's gooo
Trailer looks good I just hope they can keep the momentum
Could be zero base maxis tbh
The Avogadro made zombies eyes turn white... wonder if hes making an appearance because we banished him to Hanford Site in black ops 4, then banished it to the dark aether. Maybe he controls something now?
The quick speedy introduction 😂, that maybe the quickest "hey guys mrroflwaffles here"......yet.
What I’m thinking is it’s like the blood vials but it’s there souls this time, so they will have to go through the game getting closer to the “cowboy” kill him and get there souls back
Oh you know this villain is gonna be roasting us during the entire dlc life cycle 😂
So is the map called Ashes of the Dammed? Tbh I thought this was the new dammed theme when it was in my sub box
you guys realize its just a cinematic scene right?? The gameplay is just going to be b06 part 2 keeping all the terrible mechanics like Armour plates, scrap metal, gun rarities, terrible point system, class loadouts making hitting the mystery box pointless, zombies is just a camo grinding mode now, that's the only reason bo6 did as "well as it did". please dont fall for this and skip this cod. OG zombies will never come back
I don’t give modern zombies credit for much but this cinematic deserves it, definitely one of the hardest of all time. Hopefully the gameplay follows suit and improves as well
It LOOKS cool, but will it BE good?
Welp unfortunately I’m excited dag nabbit
It would be really interesting if the new announcer controled the players rather than the zombies since he now owns the souls of the players.
Let’s go bo7 🔥🔥🔥
Reminds me of “The Ghoul” from FALLOUT
He looks like Daniel Craig
He kind of gives me alternate warden vibes. He did say he’d be reborn. And in black ops 6 he’s randomly wearing those glasses.
Take out armor, salvage, weapon rarities, field upgrades and ability to choose starting weapon. Set a perk limit and make quests to get specialists/field upgrades unique to the map! Stop giving us guides/checkpoints to get pack a punch like a campaign mission! This game is way too easy! Treyarch has ruined such a beloved game mode…
It's peter macain
His eyes are white like the Avogadro zombies
I’m wondering if this is the corrupted dark aether version of the shadow man or dr Monty
Cowboy Ava’s dad lol
Locking in that it's Jebediah, (can't remember his name), but the bloke guided by the Keepers to build the pack-a-punch in buried.
I think it's jebediah Brown. Something tells me it's him and he's been suffering in the dark Aether. He's the one that lived. We don't know what happened to him other than just a song from the Pack-a-Punch it's got that cowboy spin to it so it doesn't surprise me
Sounds like Walton goggins!
Jebidiah Brown 💯
Genuinely, I’m interested but……I don’t know.
So there’s a shadow man  council. Got it
Great trailer tbh, and i wasnt hopeful going into it.
Hype!!!
It's Micah bell
Forgive me if my explanation is off, but the cod zombies storyline’s time is sorta flexible if I’m looking from the outside in. I can’t wrap my head around but the dark aether is almost like looking at star, which has been dying for a while, for it to reach our line of sight just now. (Time and relativity isn’t my strong suit)   I don’t think my explanation makes sense, but I guess we’re really about to explore what truly occur within the dark aether, whether we’re in the phase of the dark aether’s genisus or what is during or after the kortifex era.  Edit: FML, the original Aether story is complex as it is on how everything truly began with the whole zombies thing.
Zombies is the only thing keeping cod alive…this looks pretty good
im thinking maybe jebodiah brown?
man i just know that treyarch cries when they hear our theories because its never that deep lmao
I'm calling it now this dude is Jebediah Brown
Dude it’s JC’s dad no way
Been waiting for cowboy themed since B01 always thought an old cowboy character would be sick
I want to know if it’s going to be the original cast for dempsey, nikolai and richtofen
Jebadia Brown?
1 “bad guy”, 7 “good guys”. Does this mean we’ll be able to play in lobbies up to 7??? Or are they just gonna be lame and show us who we can play as. Would be cool if there was a change to the same old max 4 players
i caught that too, first thing i thought of was the fallout ghoul
If he's Jedidiah Brown, then those are two heads of the Angels (Dr. Monty and the Shadow Man)
Seeing the two teams work together makes me wonder how sick a cinematic that where… Primis ultimis victis requiem and this new crew all fought together. Like that would be epic.
He could be the one who grabbed Ava in drag her  in the mirror in mw3 zombies 😮
Sounds like Troy baker
I didnt see any characters start applying armor plates. maybe theres hope
The real trailer is the gameplay trailer.
That is jebediah the one who played his mom in the Pack-a-Punch machine all the way back in buried bro Milo you told me the story remember bo4
While I'm not hyped for the game, this cinematic was actually sick. Better most of the bo6 zombies cutscenes. Good job at least on that part.
Could hatman possibly be jebidiah brown? The line “this too shall pass” stands out to me, and I could be misremembering but, is that not something we’ve heard from earlier radios?
This game is done. Lame
AMBASSING SO GOOD RN
I gotta admit I'm not gonna play BO7 but this trailer is HYPE ASF. Also the cowboy from fallout in BO7 is hilarious.
Looks cool but I need the warzone affect for zombie's to go. No armour, no rarities, and starting pistols just like the old days
My first thought was daniel Craig doing his accent from knives out
Is cowboy man from Buried? Return to buried?
Was that Micheal Jackson ?
Crazy idea what if this is jeb brown the creator of the pack a punch
It would be sick if each map we fight a different shadowsmith with their own unique designs and personalities, then fight the one pulling all the strings at the end (shadowman maybe?) Kinda like in resident evil 8 you fight the different lords before you fight mother Miranda.
Reminds me of the skull of nansapwe
This villain really sounds like the engineer from team fortress 2 and i can't stop imagining it
Shadowsmith barely been in the franchise for 2 mins and he's already the biggest aura farmer 😂
Now all I need is a classic mode and I'm actually sold. Please, I don't want to play Warzone: the Zombie extraction shooter anymore 🥲
It might be the silhouette in the mirror on the original liberty fall trailer that shows the girl get taken
My gut says this is the Pap guy (sounds western, was guided by the keepers who are now all in the dark aether).
This is fire tbh
So Primus Richtophen healed from that headshot wound?
this lowkey already has me more interested story wise than anything in b06
Another garbage zombies
Gotta zoom into the poster at the end it’s crammed full of stuff
Hypothesis:Insane to be that he is maxis,
carver and tank defo gonna be best buds bc how much they are alike
Gotta be jebadiah
ITS PEAK.
I thought it was Jebediah Brown
Bro Milo’s energy out the gate makes me know this is bouta be a fire reaction
It looks so good, I’m okay being in the minority here but I’m hyped! 💯
Confirmed 8 player maps ?????? The zombie dude reminded me of Adler with them sunnies , too anyone get that feeling initially?
far from peak, but cool as hell.  the cowbow dude got me interested.
Hype Moments and Aura, no meat on the bone so far
All of the leaked maps match the character descriptions. We’re actually getting Nuked New York and a Space Station
@MrRoflWaffles I believe it's Jebidiah Brown the one who invented the pack a punch machine. He looks like a cowboy from the old west and if I'm correct wasn't Jebidiah Brown from the 1880s. Keep up with the zombies content I enjoy them.
Bro is THE “Fetch me their Souls”.
Deadass... The only "Old West" character we've had this far is Jebediah Brown...
Milo! Made it just after you posted  Love your reaction videos!!!!
liberty falls is still peak imo too
Can't believe they added Skull Face from MGSV into COD Zombies
Maybe he’s the sherif of buried
Another Snoozefest OVERHYPED with nothing lol
Well, RIP to zombies. Ugh. Honestly, i think the only way zombies live is in their own stand-alone.
My thought because it was a cowboy was leory from buried but as a villian somehow 😂 i know I'm way off but i need to stop nostalgia theorying.
Voice sounds like one in liberty falls intel
we might be back chat
Dont get hyped up. Remember how they fooled us with the Liberty Falls Trailer.
ITS GIVING….. mid
Gg, but they r marketing bro we can't conclude yet
Still not buying the game. They'll continue throwing us crumbs until they hit their profit margins and then the slop will 100% return. Fool me once.....
The villain has aura like a lot of aura
What if since Takeo is from 1591 here, he cant speak any English so he mainly just grunts and that way Tom Kane doesnt have to be recast since Takeo wont be speaking
Deathslinger dbd confirmed
You can’t tell me zombie cowboy is NOT Jebidiah Brown dude
I clicked so fast omggggg
what if he is Brutus from mob
My name is Jebediah Brown…
didnt black ops 6 just come out lawl
"howdy im the shadow rancher, its zombie time" the hat guy prolly
Zombies really might be back is crazy to say 2025
cowboy from buried
This is actually a crispy trailer and the new villain got me hooked.
As good as this looks I think I’m going to pass on this game just because I feel like it’s going to play the exact same as BO6 and get boring after a few weeks. I hope everyone who buys BO7 has fun though!
Jedediah brown?
The Skull Of Nan Sapwe
First time in years that the story has caught my interest. Hope this one actually lives up to the hype!
Milo, play the reckoning. I don’t understand why you haven’t played it yet
So glad to see milo and zombies content
Is that Hudson?
Wait so 8 player co-op confirmed???
stop buying cod games
The guy with the cowboy hat, has to the SHADOWSMITHS FROM THE MW3 story!!!! @MrRoflWaffles
Idk this doesn’t really do anything for me. Hopefully I’ll like it more when we find out more.
Here we gooooo
Honestly this villain has the potential to be one of the best of all time. Voice acting and style is immaculate. Samantha is still top tier but don’t mind the change.
