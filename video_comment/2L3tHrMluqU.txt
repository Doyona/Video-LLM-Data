This year will be Williams year for sure
Love Chanel 4 F1 coverage. But the real car and real livery or what’s the point. Feels like clickbait
I liked so much this kind of format for the presentation. More human, close to the fans, thanks for it!
Vamos Carlos. Buen comienzo.
Good luck for 2025, You'll be a top team soon.
mine was neither ear hahahahha  reading subtitles only
Left-ear love baby!
Shocking media production with the sound. You can re-edit and upload with decent sound FFS! All the money, all the gear, no idea.
Car is a shell of course. That rear wing is not real. I'm just being captain obvious for no reason. :(
So happy for Williams! Even in some of their worst years, I really liked Williams! Even when their cars looked like toothpaste tubes, I like!  Lets go, boys!
thank  god i only have left earbuds with me
Sky’s audio is choppy, this one is clear but only o bc one side😪
All white Williams livery with a blue trim would be clean
James Vowles just looks like Dax Shepard
Guys your sound balance all left 😅
I thought my headphones were broken, who mixed this to only the left channel :(
Presenter is gross.  Didnt tune in for his horny ass nor his wet dreams.  Livery looks great tho and really looking forward to all the  Carbano team vibes and James's big brain in this exciting season to come.
And why did this dude think we wanna hear about his and his wifes sex life? Gross man
really happy for Williams 💙
I had given up all hopes for Williams until James became the boss. I think no one is better qualified than James Vowles. Bro has so much experience from Merc but above all he is super intelligent, has a very pragmatic data-drive approach and a winners' mentality. Imo he will bring Williams back to the top provided he's given the means.
Dear Mike of Atlassian Williams racing. I offer my audio/video services to you; We deliver 2 channels of audio for the price of 1 :)  Wishing you guys a great 2025 season. We need to see Williams in the top 3!
Love the livery great they have a new sponsor. I hope they have a good car under them and they have a great season. Williams deserves it and fingers crossed they can move forwards be a surprise team this season it will be fantastic if they be in the battle with the top teams for victories
F1 LetssssGooooo!!
Steve!
Lifelong Ferrari fan here...Hyper excited with this journey Williams is on. So many talented people at Williams were desperate for a Captain to lead them. JV is a super talent, a super leader, a humble high performance, inspiring human being. Thank you Williams for densley adding this much excitement to our beloved sport. Frank Williams' memory is definitely honored.
Dude... We can all see your package!!!
I was watching this fine until comments about sound issue now all I can focus on is how the sound is only coming from the left side of my tv speakers.
Steve is great 👍
lol pretty ironic seeing mike cannon-brookes reading the autocue literally whilst claiming to have passion, drive and belief.
James Big Throbbing Brain is Awesome! What a stud that guy is
Looking forward to see what you guys can do this year!
Could not watch this video seriously how many times do they say the sponsors name crazy 🤪
why is the steering wheel so small
Tio James has truly turned this team around, went from needing a pay driver to having Carlos Sainz and Alex Albion within 4 years. Bold prediction: Carlos will get a win this season (sprint or main race)
Carlos looked like he was soo cold
Is there going to any tire blanket temperature difference this year?  Sooo stupid.  Keep it what it used to be, warm up of tires on track just causes wrecks happen more often.
Sound engineer here . Let me Know if you need help with the next video.
Not the actual car, not the actual livery. Just a cute marketing exercise. Zero substance. Very disappointing.
Love love carbono💙💙, love
Since Senna tragedy I came to be fan of Ferrari(adding the history and those beautiful cars). Last year was sweet(fight for wins and progress) and sour(letting Carlos go). Now I'm going to be cheering for him and Williams. Good Luck. And let the racing begin.
Oh no, ditch the tacky commentary and quiz stuff and do what you were doing so far, behind the scenes and in both ears would be better
good luck carbonoo!
carlos looks so happy here. please take care of him, williams.
CARBON 🤟
Audio is f'd on this and steve 'im welsh' jones don't help Great start!
3:30  Awfully early in the party to be proposing a gangbang, Steve. 😮
A start of a new era for Williams ! Please let it be a building block for the team !
A Family business that resolves around you James is probably why 2025 season is definitely not yours
Who is this man, and why is he so chaotic???
No wonder Williams are where they are, can't even give out a video with the correct audio balance of left and right  ffs lmao!
this was a smooth valentines day, let's go boys💙
F1 team budget. Audio guy from AliExpress
The car looks aerodynamically so simple. Is that a good thing or should we be worried?
I really hope they have a midfield car. I want to see them compete for points this year and podiums next year
So happy for you, guys! Wishing the best to the Smooth Chili Operator and the Williams team!
I didn't know Ben Howard was a mechanic  a singer and a guitar player 😅
fucking hell i won't be able to hear with my left side for a week
I spent 15 minutes tryna connect my right earphone 💀🤣🤣
I'm so happy for Williams. Best luck to the team in this upcoming season in F1. My prognosis for 2025 ranking (top to bottom): McLaren followed by Williams, then Ferrari as 3rd and Red Bull 4th. Mercedes 5th, Haas 6th, then comes the rest of the best.  Congratulations of having aquired such a important sponsor 👍
Wow Jensen looks so old now
Bigger budget, less audio. The Williams Way
Lets gooooo CARBONO!!! Lets go WILLIAMS 💙🔥
El mejor regalo de san Valentin ❤😊
WE GETTING THE PODIUMS THIS YEAR!! ¡Vamos Williams!
My right ear is seriously mad and upset at the same time! 2025 and we are back to mono? :)
I’m loving this Williams! Woot!!! Carbono!!!!
Sound in mono?
All that hype for two laps? Geez
Williams budget is so low after hiring Sainz they could only afford to record in left ear mono :D
not gonna lie, im a william fan.
So top gear coded
There is no mercedes logo any more..
CARLOS & FERRARI 💚🤍❤️
So another terrible race livery
my right ear felt a bit left out
You broke my headphones…
Great content Williams YT Team + since Carlos joined Williams, I subscribe to the channel and you'll bring in yuge revenue and support to the Team, so please keep producing mindfully I consumed this content via TV app and didn't notice left audio issue
Thank you!
Does the camera man in the garage need to take a dump? Stand still man.
Please don’t dress Carlos as if he works at a car wash 🥲
Enjoyed this ! Rooting for Williams team !! Exciting times
Given the increased allocation that Williams has over the other teams, and the pitch that was given to Carlos that made his mind up to join the team, you would expect a big step forward and for the team to be fighting for top 10 positions in most if not every race.
WILLIAMS IS BACK BABY!!!
As a Colombian motorsport fan I'm happy Williams is on its path bat to the top
* Right ear left the conversation *
I wouldn't have been mad if that was the livery. That looks good!
YESSSSS😂😂😊😊❤❤ COMON WILLIAMS!!
Somebody needs to introduce the production team to stereo.
Excited for the team and the driver pairing... but the many "Yes, yes, yes..." were as good as to be fully omitted and forgotten.
I have been a fan since 2022… and this year believe we got a good chance at even 5th in constructors
At last.. We have tons of sponsors!!!
was really looking forward to this, but couldn't put up with the awful sound quality. sorry Williams,  an opportunity wasted 😢
Why does it somewhat look like the 2023 redbull?
Always amazes me how the "pundits" and presenters just can NOT be quiet...even after saying they are going to be ! Uggh
Much as I love Williams, some of this is cringy beyond belief. Mr and Mr, give me a break….
why the sound is mono (left side only)?!?!?!
Does JV listen to tool? 😂
THATS MY BOY CARLETES, give him a blanket guys 🌶
Ciao from Italy
sweet smell of hi octane fuel can mean only one thing, it is leaded 🤦‍♂🤦🤦‍♀🌴
I'm digging the cheeky vibes, not taking themselves too seriously and being afraid to have some fun
31:53...Is that Fernando Alonso......what is he doing at Williams....?
What makes a great driver is when they can come into a team that has been struggling and be that boost for them. Carlos is that person for Williams and I am so excited to see this play out.
Translate to spanish please❤
Better contraction of the 2 names. Carlex or Alos.
Naomi shittf is no cutting edge pundit
Another year, another completely unknown F1 sponsor.
Tío James,buena suerte este año👍👍👍
Guessing there is no mention of "Jota" who Jenson drives for. Sorry had to get that in as a Jota fan.
Here's is why YT should include an audio mono option lol
No wonder they took forever to update Test Rail and shut down their Test Rail forums...  Had to do something to afford the sponsorship.
"Hey Uncle James, just a shout-out from Argentina—wishing you all the best with the new car!"  ....
Who else felt the top gear vibes
$19 billion that atlassian ceo worth 45 years of age unbelievable jeffffffff
1:56 - Neither one of them can keep a straight face. They're trying SO HARD. 😆
The man that knocked him out multiple times cuz he was almost on the verge of winning? Nah, alex will definitely not like lewis 😂😂
Richard Hammond voice: It looks exactly the same 😂
"Agreeance" is now a word🤔
Dei know nothing needs ditching!
I'm glad that they got the Atlassian sponsorship !
Podiums.. and Wins. GOGO William, might be the first time in my over 20yrs of watching formula 1 that I may actually like and support both drivers equally, both such lovable people. And James too as a Team Principle too! what a Trio
I know, let's get a stereo sponsor next year.
I like how the commentators said “I’m sure you don’t want to hear me let’s try and listen in to Carlos on the radio” and then proceeds to talk through all the radio conversations… pathetic
That is one annoying cu4t of a presenter.  Turned off after 30seconds
Atlassian Williams will now be known in my mind at least.....as the Down Underdogs......
Viva Carlossss 💙🫶🫶💙🫶🫶
Why am I only getting audio in the left channel?? lmao
37:25 “he’s doing laps in silverstone not in Italy” 🫠😬 goofy comment
Cringey game, why do it?
Low key wish that was the real livery. This was fun.
“First I need to give feedback, your not letting me give feedback” 😂😂😂😂
Best thing Steve Jones has ever done is get threatened by Ian Brown Proper Bell
Best way to start valentines day without someone
god dammit, i was so pissed off because my right earphone did't charge. i just throwaway five minuts of my life searching for another earphones!
Its jenson the first driver to press the drs button
I’ve never heard of Atlassian lol
Why Noomi?  What happened to all our F1 experts?😊
Better than sky
Sacraficed my right speaker to make the FW47 just that much better.  Edit: If you want a fix. Put your computer audio into mono mode.
Great audio Really awesome. Tried to stream to my TV and when I went back audio in my TV Box was shot had to restart everything. Great job
Seriously…………annoying, ridiculous music as the CEO of Atlassian tries to introduce himself. Which genius thought that was a good idea??
Bravo, Williams! Best of success this year!
¡Se ve muy lindo!! ¡Nos falta el doblaje automático al Español tío James!!
Man Im sitting over here cousing my computer and headphones thinking my audio was messed up lol. And it was the broadcast the whole time smh...
Now I know how Roger Daltry feels after Keith Moon deafened him with a cherrybomb.
Carlos.... and Alex, you're both so sweet!
Thank You Jira
turn on mono audio for this video guys
I went to the doctor immediately after this stream because I thought I had a problem with my right ear.
The car looks amazing, that blue is beautiful!!
Clearly this video indicates what level of technical prowess everyone can expect from this sub-par team. Maybe use some of that cash to get quality engineers?
Excellent show. Super excited for the car, the drivers, and as a IPC guy, especially the techs and fabricators breathing life into the 2025 journey.
Muy genial todo, parecía un episodio de Top Gear UK
Nice car that will never see a podium willams are a midpack team not a top performing team they wont be fighing for the podium if they win one its pure luck!!!
Activen subtitulos en español porfis 😢😢😢😢😢😢
that livery SHOULD be the 2025 and beyond livery for Williams Racing. that is a sexy livery.
NO COLAPINTO NOBODY GONNA WATCH YA
Go Williams , excelente vivo 😊 éxitos para 2025 y hacía falta un mate 🧉 caliente para el frío, acá un 🥵 calor saludos desde Argentina
oh come on, pan the audio in the middle!!!
_Atlassian! Boy, that's a mouthful! Sounds like a Greek god._
No sound no sound
my valentines 💙 with williams 🙌🏻 now let’s go get podiums carbono!!!!!!!!
Come on Williams for 2025! ❤
Live laugh love James Vowels and Williams
Where's the mono audio switch.
Ok now do it with clarkson for ferrari's reveal
Steve Jones Noooooo
Livery looks great. Don’t let the proper one be worse!
Someone didn't get the Jira ticket that the audio was left channel only.
I didnt know Super GT raced in F1!!
Exhaust note still as boring as ever.   Thankfully I only half heard it
This is TopGear TV Style
This makes me so happy. Be real nice to see f1 be competitive again.
It's crazy how Carlos eyes look similar to Fernando with the helmet on.
This is how you do a car reveal, had my attention the whole time
That waterfall joke was wild lmao
As a new F1 fan, and following first Carlos, and now Williams.  This is so hype
Broooo, get your audio mixer to edit this with headphones on to see what the problem is
Seeing as it's Steve Jones presenting, I will use my right ear only to listen to this video.
Give James V a laptop with only excel on it for his hard work.
vamos carlos!!
For a minute I was thinking that my headphones are broken ahhh.
LEFT EARS ONLY!!!!! NO RIGHT EARS ALLOWED
Finally we hit some extra cash with Atlassian! And we have Jenson Button as an Ambassador?! Dudes, Vowles is adding layer by layer by layer and we actually look like a proper top F1 team! In Vowles we trust!
As an audio engineer this made my right ear very sad. Please convert audio to mono and reupload!!!
Naomi is F1's most beautiful woman
Williams even messes up the audio
Vamos Tio James!!! Vamos Atlassian Williams F1!
It seems that now i'm "ear" lefty
I love James since Mercedes days. Hope 2025 is better year for Williams.
Such a build-up and hype, and the sound technicians mess it up by forgetting humans also have a right ear.
Come on Williams! Miss jenson button
May the Duracell partnership never end
Man this is Amazon, never seen before❤💙
I'm deaf of my left ear. There's no sound in the video
Terribly underwhelming unveiling.
I just wish Carlito collaboration with CR7 especially for 2026. They both are involved in Los Blancos.
New era for Williams
The Car looks amazing :D fingers are crossed for 2025
atlassian pls save doohan
Come on!!!!
I've been a fan of Williams since I started watching F1 in 1985. I really hope this really is a new dawn for the team. I really like what I've seen since Dorilton came in and James Vowles took over. As an Aussie I really am pleased Atlassian have come in to provide new sponsorship. Hopefully the bring in Alan Jones for special comments too! :D
Williams is going to get all the points this season. Story points that is.
FORZA CARLOS L' ITALIA E' CON TE
YES let's go team! Looking forward to this new season!
This videos’ sound is like a British roundabout - everything’s going left, and the right side’s just watching!
Why did Williams only have audio on the left? Because the right channel lapped the left, and buggered off to the pub for a cuppa!
Stop talking over the team radio!! We don’t give a sh** what the presenters are saying when the car is on track
My brain hurt from the audio hehe
uhhhh.. hope you dont forget to change the right tire as well
Got a new title sponsor, but couldn’t afford to get you right side audio. Not a good sign
Log that championship as Pending
Lewis is winning the championship 8x
my right ear is not earing 💀
I spy with my little eye..... are those GULF colours I see......?
Please fix the audio
Compared to 2020 when Williams had literally no money at all and literally had to put the F1 logo on the car because they didn’t get sponsored, this is exciting
Thought I was going deaf for a moment
It would be massive if williams can grab a podium this season. The comeback story is on!
Too bad that with all the money they got Atlassian, they were not able to hire a professional Sound Engineer so that we could get a STEREO mix LOL...
Glad to see Williams has progressed from putting their car parts in Excel to putting Atlassian on their car parts.
Te quiero Carloss ❤️ desde Argentina
So much bullshit, laptimes will talk.
Good morning Williams team!!..I'm a little nostalgic..I wish you the best for this season..Greetings from Argentina...you will always be in our hearts 💙🇦🇷🇦🇷
Great looking car!
Annnnndddd...we're off!
FOR AUDIO ONLY IN LEFT EAR => If you have mac you can just go into settings -> accessibility -> audio -> Play stereo audio in mono
Great move to film it on a potato to disguise the new aero...
I am so glad I have this button that turns on 7.1 sound so I hear at least something in my right ear
I Want Williams to Win Constructors
I'm an audio engineer. You clearly need my expertise.
2:41 thick of it?
The car on screen looks nice. This livery would’ve been good as the actual car for the season
Points for Williams in 2025 🙏🙏
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤷
No audio in the right hand side.... all good, but ffs please dont do that to the car this year!!!
Became a fan for Franco. Stayed for El Tío James
Lets go Williams! I got a good feeling
Hopefully the red stays away, this blue and white looks extremely clean!
I thought my headphones died lol😂
It's a terrible day to be deaf on the left side of the head. Still love you team Williams 💙
Audio engineer thanks for checkign the video and not realising it was panned to the left 😂
💙
Williams budget couldn't afford audio for my right ear 🔇
Unvailing what you cant tell the difference internally and its not the official livery anyway,  bit of a waste of time if you want my opinion .
I love the chemistry between Alex&Carlos. They are nice guys, funny, and determined.🎉good luck Williams
Why spend so much money on launching a fake challenger, this money could be used to develop original car.
stronger driver line up, Vowles is building (takes time ) the TEAM to it best. Hope this may get some podiums 2025 .
Can we all take a moment to appreciate that they didn't change the naming convention of Frank Williams' cars in honor of him, 47 F1 designs and going!
CARBONOOOOO
I'm a super noob when it comes to content creation, but even I get the audio right 🙈🙉
They will win the sprint this season
The quiz with James is hilarious. That's very funny.
They done forgot the right audio channel😢
Vamos Carlos go Smooth Operator? We fans just love you!
William get win world champios
How many sponsors are needed to have enough audio for both ears?
ChilliWilli :D
Letttss goww Carbonooo
the audio track is fucked up.oh williams, you really really really cannot do a single thing right.
amazing... audio is brilliant
JV is so excited about this yr like he thinks this car can win the championship 😂
As a lifelong Mclaren fan, All the best Williams. Sir Frank would be proud ❤
This really felt like a top gear episode 😂
AI-smart was intended to be a soft burn? Because I've heard that
I spent 3 hours trying to reconnect my right earphone. I thought, imagine the top comment is " My left ear enjoyed this". then i checked the comments
Gawan williams!
Imagine IF it was Atlassian Williams BMW FW47 .... 😌
my right ear didn’t hear anything it’s sad
all that money and could only afford 1 channel . . . terrible audio
That Williams looks a lot like the ferrari sf24
To change your audio to mono: WIndow+U(Settings), left side under Audio, Turn on mono audio
i thought it was just meeeee 😭😭😭😭
saving money by just using left side for sound
Yes Williams 🔥💙
No suspense. After one minute here's the car. Or is it?
Shame the car wasn't the priority rather than finding out if James Vowles knew who won Love Island or if Alex Albon wears pajamas in bed via stupid "quizzes" hosted by dumbing down merchant Steve Jones. Oh and DEI pick Schiff was also  there. Don't bother with this
At least I only have to charge my left Airpod.
It's great to see Williams actually ready before the season starts. Hopefully this year will have a way better start than last year. At least they have a competent line-up to pull it off right away 💪🏻
👍👍
Aston Martin Williams would have been the chef's kiss.
i thought something is wrong with my headphones
No more excel spreadsheet then.
This feels like a top gear episode minus the gang.
Carlos sounds f depressed LOL, coming from warmer Italy to this sht UK.
I have no left ear so unfortunately I heard nothing.
Good luck boys...  We need you pushing towards that podium
So not actually a car launch. So dumb.  What's the point of this
ON-BOARD VIEW ON A LAUNCH DAY IS WAY TOO HOT 🥵🥵🥵🥵
For Everyone who want the audio on both ears.  Just go into your audiosettings and enable Mono-Audio.
How do you fuck up the audio in 2025 lmao. But a pretty cool launch none-the-less, the right amount of everything imo.
Bruh! I thought I was deaf on the right ear 😂
williams so technically backwards that they recorded audio only for the left ear.
Bloody wonderful, Williams forever.
Williams F1, Williams number 1!
I wouldn't be mad if it's the official rivalry, looks dope
camera operator just keep still for one freaking moment geez! PS: Directing.... DOP..... moiré check...moiré check...hello...everyone there...no?!
This was great!
Bro i freaking thought that my hephones are freaking gone
that's the prettiest thing on the grid for sure lol
Settings > Mono Audio. Switch it on. Thank me later.
My left ear heated this
I wish Williams all the luck this year man! i know im a new fan!
So now Williams will be handled by Jira Tickets? 😅
The right audio channel budget went to pay Carlos his salary.
Thanks for keeping launch events going!
Great vid, one suggestion : you guys need to say ATLASSIAN even more, I didn’t hear it enough
It's so good to see the amount of sponsors on the FW47, massive W to the W team🎉
What a great show this was 💙 rooting for you guys 🤞
My right ear is jealous as heck right now
This livery is so sick I wish that the official livery will look like that
oh i know what happened, they wanted to make mono sound with left channel on normallevels and right channel in safe lower -20 db or something so they can swap fromleft to right chanel when audio gets to loud, but unfortunatelythey streamed it in stereo so it sounds like the audio is missing on right channel but its actually there just much quieter. If you need someone for your film crew, im awailable and love F1 and Williams so i would fit in perfectly :)
As an Argentine I really miss cheering for this team. Carlos and Alex make a great couple but man do I miss Franco. Hope you have a great year. Williams is family for us. We’ll be back   🇦🇷🧉
Steve is literally the best host in the business. Get him on F1TV
My right ear left the chat.  My left ear got things right.  What a launch, gents.   Hoping you saved the budget for the car upgrades.  Vamos, Carbon!
The duo we needed
we are not poor anymore 😭🙏
this is what you get when you hire a right ear def audio engineer for your stream sound :)
14:50, start! The audio is on the left side only, I recommend turning on the “mono” mode on your device to hear with both ears!
Wiliams confirmes classic livery by hinting it with good old mono sound  ;)
\/ Click here for Stereo
whats up with my right ear  its broken i think
💙🤍💙
for the admin: audio lines of the mic set on Mono next time please 😆😆
No lag ,)))
Audio in MONO ??!!   Come on guys,not the best way to start a show......!!!!
Albon’s favorite driver was Hamilton until he got pushed off in to the gravel at the redbull ring
Williams FW47 - AN ABSOLUTELY RIGHT LOOKING CAR WITH AN ABSOLUTELY LEFT VIDEO
We did it boys. We not poor anymore.
Left ear happy right now and also 17:52 is weird out of context
SHIT OF F1 HISTORY
Saving on sound budget
I think my left ear is blind.
My right speaker is jealous of the left one
You already used mono-audio transmitter just in order to save money!
The Sky Sports stream of this has terrible audio. This is much better. Albon and Sainz are nice guys 👍
Why is the audio only in the left ear? Should have put the input into stereo
I checked my headset 10 times
Thanks for this Valentine's day gift🎉
Same ugly Livery FFSHOPE ITS FAST
I had zero audio, so I had to watch the rest on Skysports.
This williams is absolutely amazing.  I didn't think Atlassian would be the new Title sponsoer.
Hats off Steve Jones! It was pleasant to listen to you.
Saibono? Alsainz? Alecarlos? Carlobon?
OH MY GOSH
Really great show this was. I enjoyed it. Thank you guys and all the best for this season!
I wonder if they'll put a custom Carbono logo on the car, and what would it look like?
If there still running 15 etc all this hype is worthless
I don’t have high expectations but I have high hopes 🤞
Let's go Carlos  💙🌶
My left ear enjoyed this.
Great to see an Australian Company as primary sponsor/partner !
Speriamo abbiano i pezzi per iniziare il campionato 😂🎉🎉
multi-million dollar operation, only half the sound
💙💙💙
Nice touch of class! Go Carbon!
LET'S GO CARBONO
Where's the fkin car
Go Albon
hell yes 🤍
