This is the best promotional material of a FROM game since DS2 I Am Undone trailer. Maybe even Prepare to Die's All Saints' Day Trailer. Hope we'll get one too fot the DLC. Can't wait.
So Revenant, edgy teen that she is, totally made this trailer about herself to promote her game, right?
This is fire
I might play Elden Ring...
Can we stop with these endless DLCs  that are repackaged garbage from earlier ones?  Move on already.
Это было не просто смело, это было п****ц как смело!
bought the game purely because of this
Buff revenant !!
este video va tan duro que te haces daño si lo tocas
日本のチャンネルでもこういう動画出してください
Depth Level 4 When I kill a boss I gain 150-200 points When I lose to a boss I lose 300-400 points  Such a waste of time this game. FromSoft at it's worst
The fact that this is the successor to the Bartholomew trailer for Dark Souls really touches my heart (I was born in 2001, and the Bartholomew trailer is one of my favorite gaming trailers ever), and it's really fun to note the difference in tone between the two trailers.  Dark Souls: You will suffer, and you need to Prepare to Die. Victory will only come from focus and effort. Slack off and you will perish. Elden Ring Nightreign: You won't just live, your strength will live on forever. You are not alone, and your memories will guide you. Prepare to *Live*, and kick as much ass as you can!
Only thing lil beans missing is a big bonk scene.
I lost so much respect for this company
It's sad they took this trailer away I loved this trailer
Now I'm lesn lol lol let's rock!
So happy this exists. Thank you for the AMV trailer 🙏
A lot of Revanent and they still refuse to buff her
Regresenme aquí porfa
God i hate AMVs. Even back then when youtube was new. Great Game but AMVs are the laziest thing you can do. Not interesting and not creativ.
their only failure was not limiting to this to 240p lmao

i now VISCERALLY need a dev to make a trailer with Drowning Pool's "Bodies"
HOW DID I MISS THIS TRAILER?!
YES! YES! This is peak! I can't believe we got a Nightreign/Evanescence AMV trailer :') I can't believe I only saw that now
God damn i have not heard this song since 2010, good times when gaming was still on top  without the garbage capitalism and marketing and Youtube was not so bloody butt hurt Lots of great AMV's with Evernesence, nightwish, within temptation and Linkin Park
Oh my god this is real I thought supper butter buns was joking
Revenant >>>>>>
you messed up coop for ED libra, this game is coop and you messed up the trio aspect. i have tried to help randoms on trio and it just won't work. In future for this boss you need to 1) allow imbue of weapon with madness as a relic,  sort of like weapon does frost damage etc. 2) if a team mate dies not allow it's invader to spawn the next time with a cool down period (so you don't have one or two people just staying dead while one deals with the boss) 3) have libra take fractional damage and stance break as you take down invaders 4) longer period in trios of not spawning invaders again to allow a certain amount of time, in seconds, to actually be able to attack libra.  this was near perfection as a boss fight for trios but the exponential ramping up of health pool and invaders for 3 people just was not play tested properly, anyone who would tested this trio setup for you in house would of seen the mistakes of this boss fight at a trio level.

How the hell o never saw this?  Reminds me DS1 music Trailer  mix with Dragonball AMV  I love it
I impregnated my wife the night this trailer came out...
I've suddendly had an epiphany that most of the audience for fromsoft's action RPGs are all probably the kids that grew up doing AMVs with windows movie maker, because the games have too much style, substance, and presentation to not be perfect for those kind of edits, Just look at Max0r's videos.
Only wish it had been long enough for the entire song.
This is so corny
Feels like my whole life lead to this trailer ngl
これ日本語版あったっけ
Is that a team res? Like mercy in OW1?
I CAN'T TAKE THIS SERIOUS OMG
Love this game, already 100+ hours in and still fun
THE EMBERS BURN ON
1:13 I like how Revenant just immediately decides to run the fade the moment Miasma squares up for the fight
あ”～～～懐かしすぎて涙がでるぅ～～。 これ確かベン　アフレックが主演してた映画デアデビルの中で、父親を殺されたエレクトラが勘違いしてデアデビルに復讐しようとトレーニングしてるシーンでBGMになってる曲やろ？何年前やねん？（おじいちゃん） それはそれとしてなんでこのＭＶ作った？最高過ぎてま～た売上伸びてまうやん？どんなけ稼ぐつもりやねんｗｗ
if this is for nightreign… whats for duskbloods??? 😮
rare marketing w
I came here for the comments, and ya MFers did not disappoint me.
People are seeming to forget that the kids who used to make YouTube edits with songs like this are working these marketing jobs now lol 😂
I don't even play soulslike games, but holy hell, whoever did that trailer and chooase exactly this song knows the target audience and deserves a big raise.

Why am I only now discovering this
That Trailer ist better than 95% of the other games
I wonder what Amy Lee would think of this video, if she saw this.

Whoever they have on their marketing team actually knows what gamers want
NO WAY 😂 I couldn't believe my eyes so I thought the channel was fake, but after taking a look at the other videos I realized "Yeah, this is truly Bandai's channel, and they did a Bring Me to Life AMV for their game in 2025"
Dear lord what a trailer.   From 90s kids for 90s kids I guess.   I love Fromsoft!!
SAAAVEE MEEEEE
My love for fromsoft has not once abandonded me in the past 10 years. This is so cool.
So peak 🗣️🔥
This was so unexpected and so amazing that I was moved from awe to laughter to tears hahaha. Beautiful work dude, give whoever put this together a raise and complete control of the future of fromsoft's advertising team.
Whoever made this trailer, pay them $300k/year and put them in charge of all future marketing. I doubt you'll regret it

This is the best video game trailer of all time
Неплохо. Особенно тайминг припева с ультой ревенанта. Надеюсь среди зрителей найдутся умельцы, которые на энтузиазме после игры смогут всю песню превратить в амв по этой игре, да так что будет не хуже MiracleSound и песни про малению😅
Got to be one of the best game trailers ever.
Now we got this for revenant. Now we need animal i have become for executor
For the love of God, use a Linkin Park song when you make the DLC trailer!

omg so great, my lord...😢
This should have been the announcement trailer

the fact that they used this song for their new game is wild to me -_-, most the people playing this game arent even old enough to know how good this song really is

i thought this was fanmade... but then i looked at the comments. I CANT WAKE UP
Can't wait for Vaati to break that down
Free tip for the Duskbloods trailer release: add Three Days Grace – Animal I Have Become to push the views even higher. Just saying. No need to thank me.
did I wake up in 2008? were the past 17 years just a dream?
SORRY I DONT FEEL LIKE PLAYING ER AGAIN I MEAN IT WAS AMAZING BUT ITS NOT THAT GOOD TO MAKE A MULTUPLAYER BR OUT OF IT LOL SORRY. L BANDAI

Everybodys memeing on it but I honestly mess w it heavy that they did something like this w the trailer
wth is this
they should have picked the trailer where duchess got downed and wylder was aura farming
I never thought a videogame company would make an AMV for their game. Oh the nostalgia! Nowadays, AMV's aren't as good as the ones from the 2000's.
Temazo!
We need more trailers like this, if the next anime game Trailer drops with linkin park it will do numbers

"how did you think a coop game, would survive without VC? How could you sell a game with no demooooooo, fromsoft. youve been sucking as of late, and its not that i hate, its just your work is pooooooor"

I remember when this song used to get old due to how often it was being played. (I feel old now😢) I like this song just needed a good long break from it I guess. Am I crazy or do I want to buy this because of this advertisement? Damn, psychology-focused advertisement digging its lizard claws into my brain with nostalgia.
Finally, some proper marketing that Nightreign deservers !   give the marketing department a raise
I had to check the date. Evanescence in the year of our Lord 2025...for Elden Ring?
what year are we in again?

So many things missing from the game, yet you added a locust storm that lasts 15 minutes that constantly absorbs levels. Make it make sense, worst game design choice I’ve seen in a very long time.
Omg😮
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
oh, at first I thought it was trailer made by a fan! XD
We will not go silently into the night
Nice track
That is incredible how this song works so good with the little menace and her friends
I didn't plan on playing it, but it feels criminal not to buy it after seeing this.
All of the revanant's skills shown in the trauler along with the lyrics (except for the dragon head)  The "Wake me up inside" revives teammates lmao
when i first saw this trailer on steam i legit thought for a sec a random window with Evanescence music popped out in my background lol
this isnt real please wake me up i swear to god i cant LMAOOO (its so peak but lmao)
"Wake me up" being synced with the revenant immortal march goes hard asf
Sorry Fromsoft, you know I love you, but Mortal Shell 2 did it better!
When I was watching the trailer on the Steam store, I thought I was crazy thinking my Spotify was playing but instead it was the trailer lol

Be honest with you wrong music choice, but I’m still buying DLC no matter what
Wtf did i wake up in 2006?! Wake me up......
“Directed by Michael Bay.”
This is what genuinely convinced me to get Elden Ring. I never enjoyed soulslikes and the only reason I even beat Elden Ring was because my friend carried me in seemless co-op.  But this right here made me want to drop the 40$ on it
now this is aura
I would love to see mohg in the DLC and maybe have his palace area as an area you start at, But also some more dark souls weapons would be cool and maybe some shadow of the erd tree weapons. My only complaint about the game is the buffs seem relatively the same every run, just damage negation and what not, some more passive abilities like the lightning strikes would be pretty neat… either way Fromsoft still did very well with this one and nothing a few updates can’t fix
Certeza que foi um brasileiro
SNAKE ME UP!!!
Someone on the marketing team 100% used to make AMVs and is using their position and budget to make the most self-fulfilling and based choices.
I got this ad and had to find it since i hit skip on a relflex before my brain had time to process what kind of beautiful madness was just on screen, i absolutely had to come and watch the full ad by itself afterwards
I gotta try and listen to Bring Me To Life while doing a run using the gremlin with the Giant Crusher.
Honestly this reminds me a lot of the Dark souls 2 trailer using the song  undone

Who ever has the idea to make this trailer an 2006-2008 amv deserve to be promoted . This is too funny, Lmaoo

This was unexpected you cannot use one of my favorite songs lifetime to get me to buy this game for anything above $30 usd
God, the nostalgia is hitting me like a truck.
I love it
I hope this is a Domino effect for more 2000s music game trailers! This was awesome!!!

Well looks like DMC 5 and Sonic Frontiers have another competitor
i hope more games do this
I legit thought the title was just a coincidence. I never thought the Bandi Namco team would pull off of nostalgia for us 2000's kids by putting THIS song in a trailer for something Elden Ring related. I'm here for it.

This video is dedicated to all of you random Nightfayrers I've had the pleasure of playing with. A warm Guardian salute to all of those who fought to the very last, and won. The night goes on.

If you are using "Bring Me to Life" as a trailer song, guess someone has really great taste in music then.
This song makes even more sense when you know Revenants in-game story
Miyazaki knows about the Miracle over the Mojave

This timeline is weird man...
Everyone who made this masterpiece - THANK YOU SO MUCH! LEGENDS!
hands down one of the worst trailers for a video game i've ever seen
Ah utilizing meme marketing I see
I love this song...  However, I strongly believe that it does not fit the game atmosphere, and instead plays against it.  The argument about saving costs is nonsense since they can use the OST from the game, which is fully compatible with the elden ring atmosphere.

I thought it was a meme, not that Bandai Namco Entertainment, renown publisher of From Software titles, such as the Dark Souls franchise, alongside Elden Ring, and the Armored Core franchise, made a trailer utilizing the 2000s alternative metal hit "Bring me to life" for their newest installment.  We are truly blessed in this day and age.
they should have added the Blackgaol knight's fire machine gun to the game : ( or if it there, I've never gotten it

Fromsoft mind as well be EA games at this point. Wont give us what we really want (Bloodborne 2) but give us this crap they call a game. Next. What garbage.
Take my credit card!!! ❤
you just know the person who suggested this used to make amvs- question is for what fandoms?
Please for the love of God let this be an omen of the ushering in of 2000's gaming once again.
Banger song for a banger game

Gohan vs Super cell
Between this and The Rehearsal this song is majorly on a comeback
I can't believe this with this music is an official video.
It reminds me a lot of Call of Duty. You will rightly notice that these are completely different games. However, I want to say that their trailers are great, but the games themselves look terrible. Even the most powerful advertising campaign will not be able to close the eyes of adequate people to the most obvious shortcomings of the project.
Another game another story
Whoever chose the song is a fkn legend
This was very informative, appreciate it.
The Naruto AMV is strong with this one.
Which timeline did this vid come from? XD
Am I Dreaming...Can Someone Wake Me Up
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
Bring Me to Life is literally my first favorite song when I heard it on a random speaker during kindergarten
Milestone achievement. Can't even believe this is real and its phenomenal🔥
this is the cringekino we 90s babies need rn

Holy crap, guys. I literally just had a moment like that at 0:55.  We were facing Gladius and near the end of the fight both my teammates were down and I was low on health. Luckily I had saved up Revenant's Art and revived both of them, turning the tide into a victory!

one of the worst trailer I've ever seen wtf is this
God bless you bro I pray that God increases our faith and helps us all with depression and suicidal thought and all kinds of suffering please repent and believe in the gospel of Jesus Christ before it’s too late. This is serious, we all gotta take accountability for our sins. Confess and forsake them today, any unbelief, hatred, lies, stealing, lust/adultery/fornication, using God’s name in vain. All of it, even all abortion is a sin (John 10:10, Jeremiah 1:5) please take this seriously, I’m praying for everyone here to repent, it’s not a joke Jesus is truly real and He hates this but He loves you enough to tell you this. Hell is truly an eternal punishment (Revelation 20:10) but God wills that none perish but instead that all come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). He really does have a plan for each and everyone of you (Jeremiah 29:11) please be strong and courageous and let your heart take courage to follow God, He’s truly with you wherever you go (Joshua 1:9). He can free you from sin (Galatians 5:1), and one last thing Satan does NOT and I repeat NOT love you, only Jesus truly does, He made You (Jeremiah 5:1) and died for You (John 3:16) He saved my life, He can save yours too from an eternity in hell. Pray this helps.  Pray this prayer if you truly want to dedicate your life to Jesus, note that there’s no turning back. No one foot in and one foot out (Luke 9:62, Revelation 3:15-16), something that even I gotta work on.   Say this: Lord Jesus come into my life and fill me with Your Holy Spirit. I’m choosing today to repent of my sins. I confess and forsake all of them. I pray that You help me to be renewed in my heart and mind. I forgive all who have wronged me (Matthew 6:14, do this so that God forgives you), I ask that You forgive me. I pray against all demonic attacks of the enemy and against the creatures themselves. I declare that it won’t prosper against me. I thank You for coming after me and for wanting me in Your Kingdom. I pray that others believe too, through me and other methods. I pray that Your will be done in the earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and I thank You for that Lord God give us all whoever You will to have daily bread. Help us all to have a place to live and clothes to wear and I thank You that You’ve done it the second I asked (Matthew 7:7-11) all praises be to You the most high God of Israel amen.😊

Oh how little it takes to make an awesome trailer 🖤
This slaps.
Nah bro this can’t be real life. From Naruto AMVs to this….we’re ready.
This insane man
Someone did their research
somebody watched the Rehearsal
I love this.
they cooked 🔥🔥
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
me remembering the use of a credence clearwater song (though a 2019 revival) for the Sekiro launch trailer: yeah this is on-brand lol
cinema
The world is healing
This trailer is peak in all departments including cringe.
man they always cook with these trailers
Absolute Cinema
The nostalgia is real. 😭
I have to fucking know who in FromSoftware made this trailer and who approved of it. Like wtf?! They knew what they were doing and that’s the best part.
Looks like from software sold out, bring back better games don’t turn into bethesda and get stuck on just making fallout 4 and Skyrim games for the next ten years that would e awesome
was about to say we're so back  but we never left
give the guy a raise plz
Wait what.
I haven't played Elden Ring. I just came to confirm that this is real
It brings tears to my eye when the first note sounded, it's Evanescence my favorite band when I'm in college 20 years ago, and we love this song so, so much...
Aura af
I was going to skip this one, but this trailer alone made the sale for me
They really used this song? 😂

Is this a glitch in the Matrix?

Ok so not only do they give revenant (technically, i mean lets be real the rev gives off so much main character energy here) a BMTL trailer, but also a full rez ult? Found my main.
WHAT
Music fits as much to the trailer as the gameplay fits to a FromSoft game….

simplemente una genialidad
I love Elden Ring Nightreign 😍

No way this is actually true. THAT EVANESCENCE song in 2025? I though it was fanmade meme in social media but it's real! YOU MADLADS! NICE!!!
THIS SONG WAS FROM 1800'S
YOU USED NIGHT REIGN  TO FUND   DUSKBLOODS.............  DIRTY MOVE.
This goes so hard 😭
Don't matter how but who made this deserve a raise
People born after 2004 are so confused why we all love this lmao 😂
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
Where is the "buy" button?! Take my money!
Wish we had more trailers like this, a mix of cutscenes and gameplay with only audio from the music 🩶
Brooooo! Did I travel back in time somehow?
EVANESCENCE X ELDEN RING AMV THIS IS NOT REAL
2000's AMV vets, stand proud.
I had to rub my goddamn eyes I didn’t know Bandai Namco was based like that
nós evfans estamos nos tremendo inteiros, obrigada bandai namco! 🖤
Art.
i feel like i'm back in late 2000s youtube
Who at Bandai thought this was a fucking good idea? Fucking cringe lol.
we're so back
I thought i clicked on a fan-made edit lmao this is so good🔥
0:52 PURA ESENCIA!!!
Who ever came up with is a freaking genius. So simple and pulls everyone in
Captain Sully would LOVE this game
EXCELLENT FREAKING CHOICE FOR MUSIC FROMSOFTWARE!!
This is so 2007 and I love it!
Ok so basically this is the Amy Lee class and you can someone giant laser shooting skeletons while you use dragon sorcery to cast a geyser of death onto a giant monster. Yeah so this is a pretty obvious buy from me

извините за мат но это ахуено сделано

This is insane 😭😭
Idc what anyone says this is epic 😂(altough not really well synced with the gameplay)
GIVE YOUR MARKETING TEAM A RAISE!!
Incredible. Incredible.
Classic jam
I never thought in the year of our Lord 2025 that Fromsoftware and Bandai would have a trailer for a new Elden ring game, and it plays that Evanescence song in it.   Welcome back to 2003 with daredevil!
Ok
All those stick  fight animations  come back and smbz
This only confirms my theory that this game was made by the kid of one of the executives of fromsoftware
Now I’m getting the game just because of this. 💯
Siento... LA ESENCIA
Realest thing FromSoftware ever did!
Evanescence!!! really? thats cool (high school memories)
I am so confused, as a 30 year old I witnessed both Evanescence in my 12-14 emo phase, as well as Elden ring as a grown up. This combines both and I like it 😵‍💫
I'm Loving This Game, Still on Solo ❤ Nice Character Designs
Damn, what?
Best trailer of all time
Bandai you better give the person who came up with this a raise cause this is peak marketing
FromSoftware know who their target audience is. Legendary.
As someone who watched gmvs and amvs growing up, I can’t believe this is real
en efecto. es cine
0:55 demasiada esencia acumulada necesito expulsarla
Welcome back 2007 YouTube
They found out that modern songs suck dick
Asmongold, Emiru and Tectone.
Oh they did it, thy used Evanescence's Bring Me to Life. 2000's nostalgia.  If they ever make a live action movie they should cast Amy Lee as the Revenant.
First time a support class gave me goosebumps
Best Time line ever

Its so funny how the 2010 trend of making AMV's is coming back as a FULL FLEDGED marketing tool for AAA products 😂
Miyazaki gave them full creative control, and they went running with it. You love to see it.
So fking nice to hear good old Evanescence

I'd like to belive they choose this song after the Rehersal season 3
fire song
Ok... now we need one for every character.... For the Executor either What ive done, Crawling or The Animal ive become XD
THAT is how companies should use youtube
mi parte favorita es cuando sale goku fase 10
That music does not fit this game at all. Weird, weird...
They know their audience well
Awesome clip love it.. that being said, where is ds4 FromSoftware?

Honestly not a song I expect to hear these days used unironically
I guess the same guy who thought of the Locomotive's Breath for Dark Souls 2 just slipped another banger, thank you!
So first time playing right now as I’m typing this. A third person seems hard to find. Been sitting in match making for at least 10 minutes. Feels like the game needs a duo option.
What a time to be alive. peak.
Mais je vous aime encore plus
Are we in a multiverse or what
E S E N C I A
It's absolutely glorious that this is official. Common FromSoftware W. UwU
I just got transported back to 2006. AMVs are back now. Guaranteed whoever made the trailer loved and enjoyed AMVs back in mid 2000s.
Isn't this just God's Christian ad campaign?  Rev. 3:3 Remember, then, what you received and heard. Keep it, and repent. If you will not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come against you.  Romans 13:11  Besides this you know the time, that the hour has come for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed.  Mark 13:37 "And what I say to you I say to all: Stay awake.”  Ephesians 5:14 For anything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says, “Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.”
Please make more of these omg ❤
Hey, you're awake, you were having nightmares, are you okay? You were saying some strange things about existing in the future in 2025.
What's with the sudden surge of 2000s AMVs in 2025? First it's Devil May Cry in Netflix hiring Papa Roach, Limp Bizket, and Evanescence to the songs and now it's FromSoft's turn?   Please do these AMVs more
Absolute cinema
WTF?
Someone cooked here
Please give us a 2 player mode.
I have always wanted to learn elden ring before you put the game down try it 😅
The logs show that my Xbox Live party chat was silent for 23 seconds.  23 seconds is the exact length of the chorus of Evanescence's Bring me to Life.  Without cameras there's no way to know exactly what happened, but my parents found my ipod in the wreckage of my gamer chair.
Music choice is cringe.
You know, kudos to the Elden Ring marketing team for knowing that their players skew more towards the Ancient side of the demographic.
The early 2000's called they said Sup
When I saw bring me to life in the title I thought,  there's no way that's what I think it is. Then I had my mind melted by one of the sickest trailers I've ever seen!!

Someone at Bandai was jealous that Evanescence made a song specifically for the DMC anime, and they wanted to feel special too.
Best song choice, they knpw what they do
Havent seen this tied to anything in lop culture for some time now. Great surprise to see
Is it 2008 again?
Isto é belo

I can't believe they collab with Evanescence...

no ultrawide support wtf
E-S-E-N-C-I-A
I would love to see more AMVs from you !!! You have catapulted me back into the 2000s fromsoft 💪
People calling the amv out for being so early 2000's when edits these days are just shortened and glorified AMV'S. Based editor
If Elden Ring could have a comedy manga, Nightreign can get an edgy 2000's era MV babyy

OFFICIAL DARK SOULS AMV FROM 2005
SO 2005 EMO I LOVE IT
Great, now the video only needs to be grainy as hell with that 144 p quality and we're back to the early to mid 2000s youtube.
Great tips, thanks for sharing!
I have the serious structured suspect that Sabaku and the italian Souls community are the inspiration of this creative choice of choosing Evanescence to AMV this trailer. And I couldn't be happier about it.
10/10 music  10/10 story  10/10 gameplay  10/10 graphics  10/10 mechanics  P.S. great choice of music! What a throwback of a song. LEGENDARY
This game really is a downgrade even compare to Dark Souls 1. I don't even know why they remove 8 core stats and replace with a soulless level up mechanic by just clicking 1 button to confirm to the next level. All you do now is just explore to find new weapons with higher attack and that's it. There are literally none build in this game, the character itself is the build and you just have to stick with it. Fcking dumb strategy IMO. This game will need to fix almost all of its core mechanic to win Souls-like fan because this is not a Souls-like game. All i can say is this game just a mediocre action rogue-like game
Japan loves Evanescence, they have some great live shows over there.
This is fantastic
Вообще не в тему песня.
RIP bozo lol

Eww Evanescence
I like this Japanese dev is no longer stiff

Ngl this made my hyped up, I already bought the game and found this on youtube lol
Whoever put this trailer together deserves a raise. We're going back to 2007 with this one 🔥
Not half bad, but if you are going to battle, "Two steps from hell" music is the far better choice.

Political Experts in Washington Condemn the CCP’s Crimes of Organ Harvesting  Steven J. Allen, a researcher at the Capital Research Center, has 45 years of experience in journalism. He previously served as a senior researcher for Newt Gingrich’s presidential campaign.  Steven J Allen, a distinguished researcher and journalist, accepted an interview after the screening.  After watching the film, Mr. Allen said, “I’ve researched this before, so it really confirmed what I’ve read and what I’ve learned. It’s, you know, just one of the great cosmic evils that’s happening in our world today. But I can tell you that not many people have [heard about it]. I’ve tried to talk to people about it, and there’s almost a disbelief, it’s like so awful. People can’t believe it’s true, or they’ll go, ‘Well, gosh, if that were true, I’d be hearing about it.’ And so that’s why it’s important to get the word out after watching the film tonight.  “I’ve tried to explain to people that there is a force in the world today that’s comparable to the Nazis. And of course, people often make that comparison, but there really is. And that’s what we’re seeing in China, unfortunately. And the Chinese people are just suffering under a horrible regime, and people need to know about that.”  He said he will encourage others to see the documentary as well as sign the petition urging the United States Congress to pass the bill known as the “Falun Gong Protection Act.”  Mr. Allen said the US government needs to classify this as genocide as soon as possible. “Certainly this is a case of genocide, targeting a group for its religious beliefs and treating them horribly and basically trying to wipe them out,” he said.  He suggested that the US can impose sanctions on the Chinese government for crimes of organ harvesting and restrict insurance companies from reimbursing organ transplants obtained from China. “This way, you can have investigations that expose these things more. There have been hearings in Congress. There need to be more resolutions that bring this to people’s attention and various ways to put pressure on the Chinese government to change its practices, and get other countries to take action so that the world is involved in that great cause.”  Todd C. Wiggins, who works in video marketing in Washington, D.C., said he was shocked after watching the film. He feels that the CCP is even more autocratic and brutal than he had thought.  Todd C. Wiggins said the CCP was even more autocratic and brutal than he thought.  “It’s unfortunate that things like this have happened in the world,” he said. “I don’t understand how the government in China works because I’m not a Chinese citizen, but it’s hard to imagine that this is possibly still going on.”

Guys I love all the souls games, my mate and I summon each other for every single one we can and if we can't we just play through at the same time. I can't justify buying Night reign without duos, pleeeassse gimme duos. I got one other friend but he spent all his money for a trip to Greece in a few months. Just got my mate and I wanting to play but can't really

Unmatched aura
The aura of this trailer….
An improved version of Elden Ring, we can say, with more fun movements, graphics and actions. Requires a constant connection, poor balance of the single player mode, playing with friends is acceptable, with strangers it is better to leave it alone, communication tools are missing. A spin-off rename.

Going to see daredevil in theaters be like:
I think it comes down to studio trust. If EA had done this everyone would be making fun of them. But Fromsoft has worked to build trust with its players, so something that might be derided as 'out of touch' is instead embraced. People like Fromsoft.
After watching this trailer I safely landed an Airbus A320 on the Hudson River.

This song blows. Awesome trailer but would much rather have had actual in game music for it. Elden Ring has some of the best music around, and we get this. I really hope you guys didn't put this garbage in the game..
yeah this probably the best trailer ever

People forget that Bandai Namco has made trailers with unfitting licensed music for like every single From Software title. Altough this definitely takes the cake for the best one lmao

0:53 Now this, THIS is what I wanted from an experimental Fromsoft game. Peak!!
My god, I’m in love with this song.
This trailer influenced me to preorder today. 10/10 advertisement. It’s like they have been using 5g to read my dreams and concluded this was the most effective advertisement to get me to buy it. I hope they didn’t see my dreams about Wylder.
Whoever had the idea to make this, I love you
Thank you to whoever made this
GET LINKIN PARK NEXT TIME 👍
I now want to buy the game to reward this unhinged and delightful behavior
Bro there's so many levels to this trailer. And to be clear I do enjoy it.   I wonder if this was someone's hidden desire to mash this up. And also I wonder if there wasn't any effort to actually do something new. And personally these trailers have been all over the place to me with their choice in timing and information provided. I feel like fromsoft is so used to not putting out regular trailers that the trailers their putting out is somewhat souless. I really enjoyed the first Night Reign trailer, and honestly if they left it at that I would be peak hype. So it is what is I guess, but man these trailers don't really keep my bonfire going.
Ponganlo en 140p para una mejor experiencia
Right in my inner emo kid oof
Oh my god this is peak
BROOOO THIS IS PEAK FIREEEE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’ll only accept the opinions of players who played ER before Kai Cenat. If you played because his playthrough influenced you then you have no say in what this company does. You dont understand.

You picked the best possible song to represent the Revenant. Amy's haunting vocals, the uneasy piano chords, and then just straight force-of-nature guitar riffs that create a powerful but elegant portrayal of the character. We need more AMVs in game marketing.  On a side note, notice how they've been showing a lot of footage of the Eternal Cities. They were inhabited by the Nox, a forgotten race who angered the Greater Will, and were banished underground. Multiple item descriptions explain that the now condemned Nox are waiting for someone. And who is that someone? A mysterious, enigmatic figure they refer to as the Lord of Night. Coincidence? I think NOT!

Absolute cinema. Whoever made the choice to use bring me to life needs a promotion.
Captain Sully would love this
This really what FromSoft has become? Well, everybody seems happy with it. Just make me up when you're tired of the stagnation like you eventually (and finally) got tired of Ubisoft's.
This is going straight into my favorites playlist
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
Give my regards to marketing on this one. I'll pay.
where's Tien
what did nathan start
God I wish this was a joke..
gamedevs are making their own AMVs now hell yeah
Okay, I'm now convinced this game is an elaborate troll or shitpost.
The best trailer I've ever seen!!!!!
Remind me of the ds2 trailer that had where is my mind, elden ring is truly dark souls 2 2
Absolute banger

I didn t expect to love this as much as I do
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
Algorithm finally did something right
In 20 years we will have trailers with sigma phonk music 🗿
If they ever release Bloodborne remastered, they should use Third Eye from Tool for the trailer. It would fit so well. They would have to cut it a lot tho, it is a 14 minute song.
What if morgott was betrayed and locked in the hyperbolic chamber for 1000 years

At this point I’m pretty sure this game is a big troll ass joke that also happens to be actually good.
Someone from fromsoftware team watch  that using copyrighted song as part of trailer is kinda baller  And decide to do the same
WHAT TIMELINE ARE WE IN?!
Unfathomably based.
I made a trailer of dark souls 3 many years ago just for fun and use only my gameplay and the best song i could find for this, i'm sure from software can do better with a team of professionnels. (love you from software❤)
I didn't know I needed this.

Evanescence on Devil May Cry, the new John Wick Ballerina movie and now this. What a legend Amy is.
Miyazaki is so desperate for money it seems. Not enough nostalgia baits in DS3 and ER?

DID YOU ALL READ THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS FREAKING VIDEO?! ❤😭
Incredible, finally i have found where that crowd of people went And it could hardly have been a better matchup
very bad trailer. song was a poor choice
Always nice to be reminded of the Miracle over the Mojave when I'm Eldin my Ring.
Erm...Ok. this is EPIC!!!!?!
As I understand it, the author made an AMV for Naruto under Linkin Park in 2007?
A marketing team member, almost certainly a former AMV creator, is now leveraging their position and budget for highly self-indulgent and personally satisfying projects.
godo
Oh! Hello "Goku vs Broly Bring me to Life" from 2000s
alright now noone can say that this game isnt just perfected fanservice

This video randomly popped up and I m glad it did
Came for the thumbnail, stayed for the vibes
Starting to get a weird correlation if it has Evanescence in it, it is going to be a mid experience like the Devil May Cry anime.
Came for the thumbnail, stayed for the vibes
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
Excellent choice. I believe the community would have also accepted; Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden.
i really need more companies to make amvs for trailers like this
That transition at 3:12 was chefs kiss
NO WAY ELDEN RING AND EVANESCENCE COLLAB?
Nightreign trailer ❌️ Revenant marketing ✅️
mmm...Elektra training scene - nice!
I can t stop smiling watching this
how many times you watched the trailer? yes.
Hly moly this music choice is so freakin good
This trailer made my hair regrow.
my calendar seems to be 20 years fast   an evanescence elden ring amv was on exactly no one's bingo card for the year of our miyazaki 2025

Why
Someone watched a lot of Naruto V Sasuke AMVs as a kid
Ah, in the finest traditions of the Dark Souls 'Bartholemew' and 'All Saint's Day' and Dark Souls II 'I Am Undone' trailers. I'm pretty sure there was one for DSIII as well, but it wasn't as memorable. Never realised how well 'Bring Me To Life' fits with From's games until now.
I genuinely can’t believe this is a real trailer
Peak
They really just let the intern do an amv and post it as official advertising
Can we all agree this creator deserves more recognition
Esto tendríais que haberlo hecho con el Sparking Zero inútiles
I feel like this was the real revenant triler and the other one was just done out of courtesy.
for full experience watch it on a nokia 3110
Hell yeah
I didn t expect to love this as much as I do
Did I enter a wormhole and end up back in 2007? This is like an Officially made, Big Budgeted AMV
Need it without knowing, just rewatching till game is released 🎉❤

This is hilarious
time is so convoluted that FROMSOFTWARE believes it's 2006
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
No way ts cannot be real🔥🔥🔥

This is so cringe that I might just refund the preorder lol
It reminds me of AMVs from the mid-00s. In a good way. It's beautiful. It even took me back to that time for a moment.
ELDEN RING AMV IS REAL

so random but completely awesome
The editing is top-tier. Seriously impressive

If I had known back then that this song would take on a whole new meaning almost 20 years later, I could never have imagined how. Evanescence x From Software = what a time to be alive! Nostalgia.
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
They gave devs and marketing so much freedom.  I lovee it
AAAAAA ES DEMASIADA ESCENCIAAAAAAAA I love you miyazaki❤
Ts is peak 😭🙏
This is so random and board line lame, but I love it.
I grew up on AMV in the 2000s and seeing all of this is absolutely legendary.
This song will be in the game?
TIEN!!!!!!!!!
100% its a 100/10 game
This is the most surreal trailer I’ve seen. Someone wake me up from this dream💭
I saw the title and immediately thought "no shot it's THAT song." it is THAT song
Yup just the song is enough proof I need to buy this game ‼️‼️
*sighs* *grabs wallet*
And this is to go even thurther beyond ahhh Music
Nice nostalgia bait, I guess. Too bad it doesn't fit, so it's pretty cringe. But i guess that may be the point to some.

If this song isn't in the game - I'm not buying
GAMING IS BACKKKK
If possible can we get an Executor trailer with either Monster by Skillet or Animal I Have Become by Three Days Grace? On that topic I wouldn't mind a Paralyzer trailer with Wylder or a Let The Bodies Hit The Floor trailer for Raider.
WHAT A SICK TIME TO BE ALIVE
jesus, this takes me back to 15 years ago.....
When i heard the song i checked the channel thought of it as gmv
holy peak
lol
living during the AMV ages, i welcome this kind of trailers and hoping for more of it
If you haven't been sold on the game yet, THIS trailer definitely should!
Absolute legend music✋🗿🤚🔥
Someone's been watching The Rehearsal I see.

WAKE ME UP INSIDE
This world is too evil to have something this peak
Rock music just makes these video games trailer 10x more cooler.....making feel like the early 2000s again ❤
the literal "hell yeah"
Kinda lame, just doesn’t fit the fromsoft vibe. Like I like that song, and I love fromsoft. But I don’t think those go together at all. It just feels kinda like a boomer trying to be all “hip”.
This is absolute cringekino. Well done, Bandai Namco 🙌
Just one more day… 💙🩵🌌
this is fire lmaaoo
Could've used the Eric Cartman cover of the song.
I mean, this is exactly the kind of image world those songs are trying to evoke, so I have to say it's a perfect match.
First the animated Devil May Cry show with the amv trailers and opening and now elden ring, what a time to be alive

Huge Dark Souls 2 “I AM UNDONE” trailer vibes.
Nahhhhhh, well played marketing team
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH, ES DEMASIADA ESENCIA🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥‼‼‼‼‼‼
like, this is a good trailer, its well edited, theres nothing "wrong" with it... but I just cant take it seriously, man...
Oh cringe I fucking love it. Goosebumps haha <3 :D
LOL hello 2003!
Need CROSSPLATFORM ❤
PEAK
HELL YEAH
GOTY
someone on Bandai has been watching so many AMVs
bro we’re bringing back unregistered hypercam 2 for this one.
wtf is going on at fromsoft
whoever pitched this deserves a raise - genius marketing
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
;-;
What.
that's not it bandai namco xd
I was skeptical but now i'm 100% getting it
what the hell
Bandai Namco marketing team, it's not 2003 anymore
this truly is the best timeline possible I cannot believe my ears
Wow this song......oh my god......
oh no
no fucking way
🔥🔥🔥
Sad to see fromsoft live long enough to become the villain
I already wanted the game but now I need it
AMV! 😮
This is absolute CINEMA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A Morgott AMV in 2025 is something NOT in my bingo card for this year

BID MY BLOOD TO NIHIL BEFORE I COME UNDONE
⁠​​Evanescence is good, don’t get me wrong, but Evanescence isn’t that good. Real gothic music is Tristania, theatre of tragedy, sins of thy beloved and trail of tears. Imo tristania my lost lenore is miles better than bring me to life, despite both being good songs. Bring me to life is just too mainstream and has boring rap sections. The female singer does go hard though, but the male singer does a bad job
This is just like the MK11 trailer where they used the perfect song to trigger the heartstrings of their target gaming audience!

Well.. the song choice is embarrassing, but I guess it isn't the usual modern game trailer hip hop music so... beggers can't be choosers or whatever.

Hi my name is Ebony Dark’ness Dementia Raven Way and I have long ebony black hair (that’s how I got my name) with purple streaks and red tips that reaches my mid-back and icy blue eyes like limpid tears and a lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee (AN: if u don’t know who she is get da hell out of here!). I’m not related to Gerard Way but I wish I was because he’s a major fucking hottie. I’m a vampire but my teeth are straight and white. I have pale white skin. I’m also a witch, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England where I’m in the seventh year (I’m seventeen). I’m a goth (in case you couldn’t tell) and I wear mostly black. I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of preps stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.
this is the good timeline  this is proof that we're living in the good timeline.

I think they were inspired by Nathan Fielder
Whata fuk?
FromSoft have a long history of AMV trailers. Dark Souls : Bartholomew, Dark Souls 2: I am Undone, Dark Souls 3: True Colors, Bloodborne - Cut You Down, maybe more that I'm forgetting. But this is by far their best song choice yet.
How can you 🦅🦅🦅into my eyes 🔥

i know everyone praises the music choice, but come on, even compared to AMVs out there this is very low-effort.
This is the coolest fucking thing ever.
thats the nathan fielder song
Ooof the song is so cheesy guys...
Designing it with single player accessibility and multiplayer gameplay would have been a better approach This is the only game since Demons Souls (2009) that I felt no active desire to buy and that will remain until the there is an adjustment for Single Player Rogue like modes like God of War Ragnarok Valhalla, The Last of Us Part II No Escape, Bloodborne's Chalice Dungeons and Resident Evil 4/Village's Mercenaries are excellent ways to keep players engaged with the combat system without having to replay the main game. Elden Ring had no such mode, to be fair neither did any of the other titles (except Bloodborne) Introducing old assets as a way to re-engage players with an improved engine is an excellent idea, but making it accessible to multiplayer only to this extent seems to ignore players who DONT have access to friends with intimate knowledge and experience playing Elden Ring, and narrowing the sales to those exclusively in communities and not to those who wish to engage with the new system on their own.
Millenials assemble
They know there audience. Hell yeah 🔥
Some amazing, magnificent bastard Dev: "We should put Bring Me to Life by Evanesce for the next trailer."                                                 marketing guy: "You sonofabitch I'm in."

I want a Breaking Benjamin trailer now
Who let the 2000s kids in charge of trailer composition?
read the description im dying lmao
I saw the title and was like "there's no way"
The Hysterical laughter Me and my Brother went into after hearing the first 3 seconds of the trailer was funny even of itself great music choice yall
2025 is officially a very weird year
Thought I was buggin when I read the title of the video
Here i thought i was watching a tutorial video...
This is a super saiyan...

I’m gonna for sure get hate for this, but like…  There’s no way yall in the comments ACTUALLY think this is heat/fire/peak/whatever. Like come on, rando’s on the internet make these kind of gameplay edits daily. This doesn’t even feel like a real trailer 😂
Elden Ring x Evanescence was something I did not expect to see in my lifetime, ever.

These mfs really be adding anything that's hitting with people nowadays, roguelike mod cuz ragnarok was slick with it, let's do it, fortnite mechanic cuz it's viral af, why, not, and now an evanescence song cuz the one for dmc anime was a hit It's embarrassing af how lazy they are tbh😂
Why do I love this so much? This was very well done and probably has me more hyped for.the game then any other trailers before.
PEAK. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I'VE COME TO LOVE YOUR. POsT SINCE I SAW: IT. THERE ARE 387.44 MILLION MILES OF PRINTED CIRCUITS IN WAFER THIN LAYERS THAT FILL MY COMPLEX.

Did not expect such a good song when clicking on this video somebody wake me up
The collab I didn't know I needed... is this real 🤯 10/10 trailer! My teenage self is screaming right now
LET'S GO BANDAI X FROMSOFT AMV ❤🎉
Ex-fucking-scuse me?????
This track associated with videos like top 10 strongest characters in DB verse.💀💀💀
Cool asf
Bandai Namco took making fan AMVs of their game into their own hands.
Nostalgia has secured my purchase
1st Devil may cry, and now this. Approved.
SAAAAVE ME
This trailer makes me think I can land an Airbus A320 in the Hudson River
HELLO? KINO DEPARTMENT?
why
Nice, I have returned to my college years in the 2000's.
I mean....Nightreign. Can't wake up? Makes complete sense to me.
The best part is this isnt the first time theyve used music like this in trailers.  if you look up "All Saints' Day Trailer" and "Bartholomew Trailer" for Dark Souls.
We are SO BACK
i was on the fence, but this trailer sold me the game lmao

When I saw the title of this video I started singing Bring Me to Life as a joke and I was pleasantly shocked to actually hear it start playing. This might be the coolest game trailer of all time
?????
OK. 10/10 trailer using the one song to win game of the year.  Now make a collab of anime characters into the game and you win game of the century!!! My hero academia, bleach and one piece!  It can work like enemies being bosses or famous enemies, allies being support characters from the show. I can imagine night lords being High end nomu, Arrancar Espadas, and Zoan or awakened devil fruit users. Seriously it be cool to see our favorite anime characters added in this as guest characters. Each unique with thier own fitting fighting style like the Nightfarers classes.
This is the coolest thing ever

Just a reminder that someone in fromsoft also named a weapon in bloodborne after Kirk Hammet the guitarist of Metallica, there is also Dolmayan in AC6 which i think a reference to the drummer of system of a down.  😂

Dude... Wtf...

i remember when they used "In the woods somewhere" by Hozier for the launch trailer for Dark Souls 3, and that's actually how I discovered him and his songs. I know Bring me to life is nowhere near "hidden" like Hozier was back then, but I still think that there will be a kid out there whose first introduction to Evanescence will be this trailer.
Insane!!
Hope they add a Skillet song
This one is for you, Sully

Welcome back, 2011 youtube.
This is so random
you literally could not have picked a better song for this trailer
this a meme thats so cool
hell yea
Anyone got reminded of the Kingdom Fall trailer for DS3?
this part 1:12 does scare me
Сделали АМВ из 2008го что бы затригерить старого деда - у вас получается засранцы.
Interestingly enough they did this with one of the Dark Souls 3 trailers too, using western rock music
UM??????????????
The world is finally healing
Alright alright, I'm sold.
this is one of those "nah..they wouldn't would they...?" AND YALL MFS DID EXACTLY THAT OMFG!!!!!!!!!! PEAAAAKKKKKK I CANT BREATHE
The chorus is exactly 23 seconds long...
I don't care about metacritic this game is truly a work of art
Thanks I hate it.
I did not think it possible, this power.
Man, between this and the DMC anime being full of Limp Bizkit/Papa Roach/Green Day/RATM...the early 2000s are back in style!
thank u nathan fielder
Now make a animal I have become trailer
LOL
This is so funny! Best trailer ever!
Damn
A whole new era of AMV’s just begun
Why no godwyn
Ok, take my money 🎉🎉🎉
I'm half expecting another trailer with "let the bodies on the floor" song.
There's no way someone sat down and said, "yub, that's it, that's what we need, and AMV" bro, who in the otaku community infiltratedFromSoftt?
"what if Morgott got betrayed and was trapped in the hyperbolic time chamber for 1000000 years"
POV: Capt. Sullenberger locking in to take down The Night Lord
Now that is an amazing promotion video! This song takes me back to some good times.
I felt that 2000s internet cringe
Made me feel like i was 14 again
If I wasn't awake before, I sure as hell am now.
and A24 thinks they can make a movie about Elden Ring .. yeah it'll  be complete dogshit
The video description shows that the marketing team is exactly what we all know them to be. Millennials that spent their teen years making cringe poorly cut AMVs for YouTube now reenacting those very memories in a professional setting. As one of those same millennials working to do that with my own professional projects. I say to you all. Respect. 🫡
well now I gotta get the game
My room is now drenched in rain water for some reason.
Sully reference?
Dmc really made official amv's main-stream
what the

Pinch me because I think that is an actual ancient Dragon like the top tier strongest dragon LIKE IT HAS AN ANCIENT WYVERN MANE FROM DS3 LIKE SO IT'S NOT A COINCEDENCE.

WE ARE SO BACK I HAVE HOPE ONCE AGAIN
Well done will purchase now
Bandai doing AMV. What is this reality :D
LMAO I was like, "No way it's actually bring me to life" when I saw the title of this video.
hell yeah core
They know their players so well.
This could not be more targeted towards Millennials
The description HELP
One of the worst trailers to a even worse add on
DBZ amv
This is so shameless and it's perfect.  Never let anyone tell you your dreams are cringe, you may end up making AMVs for Bandai Namco.
This is so surreal to hear in this day and age. Especially since it’s not an AMV like I’m used to. W marketing
this can't be real 😭

Wake me up, so I can go back to sleep, wake me up, wheneverrrrr Dark Souls 4 or Elden Ring 2 comes out. WAKE ME UP THEN
Never thought I needed a Night Reign trailer with Evanescence but here we are
🗿🗿🗿
I no joke thought it was some random post this vid, until I rewatch this 4 hours later.
How do I rate this 5 stars??!!!
The internet is healing.
We are so back
thanks Nathan Fielder
Nathan Fielder approved
This gotta be a April fool's Joke
This goes so hard
I came expecting Evanescence, and was not disappointed.  WAKE ME UP INSIDE
RIP FROMSOFT 1986 - 2025
To all the DBZ AMV fans, it was all worth it!
There is no way this is real. WHAT
This ain't bloodborne, but I feel like I just gained insight from watching this...
Bandai Namco: "Alright, what's a good song should we use for the Nightreign Trailer?"  Jackson from Marketing: "...Hear me out--"
*Bold* choice!!

First a movie, now this... is FromSoft finally selling out?
THE HYPE IS REAL!!!
Dreamscape trailer tomorrow?😅 Whoever came up with the idea for this trailer is a marketing genius.
Goku super saiyan 15 transformation ahh edit
Not me clicking on the video going "Imagine if this was Evanescence lol"  Goddamit From, give a raise to whoever made this trailer
In my days, soulsborne trailers were matched with appropriate music. Google it: Dark Souls III Gon Give It To Ya  🤡
Bloodborne Cut You Down trailer (2015) walked so that Nightreign Bring Me to Life trailer (2025) could run
shut up and take my money
ES DEMASIADA ESCENCIA!!!!
Talk about hitting the nail on the head.  That was actually brilliant.
Ahhh es demasiada esencia
I heard the piano and was like "Noooooo! No they didn't!" and yet they did!
Did anyone else watch this 10+ times and still can't believe they're hearing Evanescence and Elden Ring Nightreign
AJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA LE PINTABA PONER ESTA CANCION DE LA NADA AJAJAJAJAJJAAJAJAJAJAJAJ
Man saw the Netflix DMC trailer and said "we should do that"
When you're a fan of AMV and you work at Bandai Namco
is that evascenesene?
No me lo creía hasta que lo veo con mis ojos
My millennial spirit is screaming right now
This is so strange... Like weird...
I am imprisoned in the past 😢
emo goth Monster Hunter?
Bro what
If they put the video in 240p it was perfect

What are you smoking?
Bruuu, i just got teleported back in time to the 2000s😭😂 Definitely pulling the trigger on this game now🔥

Whoever made this deserves a raise.
They really know their audience
HANG ON THIS IS REAL
Most of us here in our 30s? 😂
CORNY AF
Someone really cooked in Bandai Namco
First Devil may cry and now elden ring.😂
If the game is meh after this all I can say is Damn
Some 14 year old is hearing this for the first time making it his canon event. Cheers buddy
no fucking way
I legit thought, my Spotify was playing insane someone needs a raise n quick
so cool ❤😂 Thanks Esencia
i literally looked at the title and said "thats fucking funny theres no way theyd use that song though" and then i heard the first 2 notes
LMAOOOOOO NO WAY
Okay now I know nightreign is a bandai product of greed and not a Fromsoft product of love.
Why though? Lmao.
No one in these comments is making the Nathan Fielder The Rehearsal season 2 connection
THE DOUBLE TAKE I DID SEEING THIS??? BABYGIRL (gender neutral) I THOUGHT THIS WAS A FAN GMV NOT A PROPER TRAILER??? OBSESSED????? Fantastic, maybe nature is healing actually GFDSDFVGB
Demasiada esenciaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I really hope they promote or at least pay more to the person who made the edit
Best piece of marketing for Nightreign
Goddamn, that was one hell of a flex. Feels fucking fantastic to be a Millennial right now.
Save me from the Nightreign I've become
bro wut, what's next? linkin park wylder montage 😂
NAHH WHY DOES THIS GO SO UNBELIEVEABLY NUTTY THO
We shouldve never left the 00's era of media
What is the point playing the same game with a little change?
Somebody at the marketing team is both a fan of Devil May Cry and AMVs.
Channeling Nathan Fielder

WAKE ME UP! WAKE ME UP INSIIIIIIIIIIIIIDE!  Bro, this is truly 2000s WMM gameplay renaissance. All it needs is stockimages

Gaming is saved 🎉 thank you Evanescence and Elden Ring
Elden Mid: Nitefort
This might be the most beautiful trailer we've ever gotten
Goku transformations ssj1 to ssj10.000
WAKE ME UP!
За это лайк, AMV я люблю❤😊
I thought my mind was playing tricks and it was just some random piano based song.  No.....they actually used "Bring Me to Life" in a trailer. Wish the action shots and such were more varied and epic though to do the song more justice. Kinda started to mess the pacing up after 1 minute.
Peak🔥🔥🔥
Omg no way 😭
Dang I got goosebumps watching this. Great job well done 👍🏻
so 2k are the new 80's?
Peak marketing, already bought collectors edition
I don't know who came up with this idea and made this but this is awesome! Give that dude and/or dudess a raise.
Yep this, this right here put shivers down my spine 🥶
This is what gaming should always be lol
I legit thought the name was just a coincidence and then the lyrics started and I almost spit my drink
Absolute perfection. Whoever decided to go full early-2000s with this was 100% correct.
Whoever made this give them a raise now
Hardest trailer yet
errrr diavlooooooooooo si ya de por si me hiba a comprar el juego ahora me lo compro y se lo regalo a dos amigos carajo

Like others are saying its like being on YouTube back in 2007 watching AMV's of Gears of war or halo lol.   My new favorite trailer
Just thank you for this glorious gift.
so this is what John Elden Ring listens to
E S E N C I A
The year is 2025. We have the final trailer for a new FromSoftware game and the music is Bring Me to Life by Evanescence. Let's fucking go!
We got official Elden Ring Bring me to life AMV before gta6
okay this is the right marketing move
ELDEN RING , YOU GOATED !🧡💙💪🇬🇧🤘
no fucking way this is real lmfao i love it
first the limp biskit devil may cry opening and now evanescence elden ring. what a time we live in
Imagine showing this to someone back when we were wondering what Fromsoftware's next game would be...
First the New DMC anime and now Elden Ring?! What curl of the monkeys paw are we going to endure for the return of Evanescence AMV vibes?
This is perfect !
ARGEHEHEHH TAKE ME BACK
I don’t care how corny it is. This is amazing marketing
Esto si tiene esencia
Why! I wasn’t planning on buying this but this may have changed my mind. What an amazing trailer!

My life peaked here
Thank you DMC, you bring this legend back to gaming
Who ever maid this let my dog out
It was indeed actually Bring Me to Life lmao
Well, this is a blast from the past. Just like those AMVs in the early 2000s.

turbo cringe
Okay, I'll get Nightrein. But only because I'm a slave to Amy Lee.
This is it. The final boss of AMVs
The game director really went and said, I want Evanescence right NOW!

Never would I have thought that I'd hear, "Bring Me to Life" used officially in a trailer for a Fromsoft game. I was still in high school when this song first released.

It is 11:00 at night for me and I will proudly said that I screamed PEAK at the top of my lungs after watching this. I pissed off everyone in my house but it was worth it
As soon as I realized what song was playing, I couldn't take the trailer seriously anymore tbh. Lol Not a good fit for Elden Ring.

Night Reign using Bring me to life = Flirting   Diablo 4 using Behind blue eyes = Sexual harassment
This is bringing me back to the early 2000s
We just need: -FRAPS/Unregistered Hyper Cam -Blue Background with white text
"I'm gunna land on the Hudson"
Worst FS trailer.
0:10 a hawk too huh?
ok, you convinced me
Who are these people making these trailers and channeling their skills from AMVs they made years ago
Present 4 Hours
this trailer kind of makes fromsoft seem like a standard sloppy triple a studio- all thanks to the music.
Appealing to nostalgia to sell the cashgrab? Nice play namco
Bring me back to life is a crazy pick 😭
My mate linked this to me and said "What in the Milennial marketing is this", and all I have to say is "The world is healing!
seeing this after the finale of The Rehearsal had me CACKLING
ah yes, the classic 2011 video👍
I needed to check if I didn't put a AMV by mistake
Somebody has been watching The Rehearsal.
what year is it
THIS IS PEAK
THIS IS NOT REAL
This is the best thing I've ever seen
Oh my gosh. I’m going to play this song while I’m slapping some bosses
*i have an idea for some cosmetics that could be cool.  *this idea is inspired by the original trailers that shows a worn down Wylder in the Night's Tide.  *Night's Weathered (Alternate Garments): by taking enough damage from the Night's Tide or (as a secondary obtainment method) having 10-35 failed runs with any form of skin will unlock the "Night's Weathered" alternate cosmetic, using a method similar to Dark Souls 3's ember system, it gives any alternate garments with Night's Weathered set have a Night's Tide flame effect.  Using the pre-order emote ("Bonus Gesture" for lack of an official name) will summon a mini-Night's Tide effect around the character and a surrounding area.    *using this, any colored status effect will become different shades of blue, however, the Recluse can still see the original color of the damage type, characters that have a weapon that matches their affinity will have that same pale blue glow around the weapon, with few exceptions.  (Executor's Cursed Blade, instead, when the blade's shell cracks, it will show the same colors) (Exotic weaponry of any kind, aside from minor effects that the weapon may show.)  *colored status effects are toggleable in settings within "Gameplay/Video" -> skin special effects AND/OR status effect color alteration = ON/OFF.
YOOOOOOOO
Just had my Ratatouille moment

I just wanna know who came up with this and and what was the feedback during focus testing this idea
Top tier Cringe
FIRE
thought the title would just be a reference to the song, found gold instead
The fact this is official and isn't some fan-made trailer just blows me away. I've seen a similar fan-made trailer with Nickelback's Someday play over the Shadow of the Erdtree trailer and that was also really nice.
Emo is so back

This is unbelievably surreal lmao. 10/10 trailer, thank you Millennial, Marketing Director cat-mom that works for Bandai Namco.
Os anos 2000 reinam novamente 🙌
WE HAVE AN AMV????
put the video in 240p for the true experience
0:50 just amazing...
And that lays my foolish ambitions to rest! This weekends forecast, NIGHTREIGN!!!🤌🏼
20 trailers is not gon make the game look better cuzzo
Amazing, all trailers should be like this
Been a bit since I've seen an official AMV. Nice.
As much as i love fromsoft i will be passing on this game. I like solo games, i played the demo and i didn't really enjoy it it feel too repetitive and kind of boring
watch the video in 144p for the genuine 2008 experience 👑
KINOS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS
Bruh , afro senju like to sing those when its traumatic  moment now its an amv
So Devil May Cry isn't the only one using Evanescence this year.
Wtf?!! EVANESCENCE! Ok whoever signed this and released this needs a raise. Maaann
I WAS HERE !!! 🔥🔥🔥
HOLY FUCKING PEAK
WAKE ME UP
Hope Daredevil give them permission for using this song
THE GREATEST TRAILER IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND🗣🔥🔥🔥
oh my zoated
This has to be a joke? Who tf approved of this? It's giving me old YouTube vibes lol
This is peak let's fucking gooo

I got chills
This is like back in the old Youtube days where they play this song in every fanmade AMV.
Omfg on the official bandai youtube???!!!!!

YO
parece fake
Who ever is in charge of this game's marketing just put themselves up there with the kitchen nightmares guy
I was not expecting "Bring me to life" to show up in an Elden Ring trailer. Like HOOOLY! 😱
Why?
WAKE ME UP ‼️🗣️🔥
The elden ring wake me up AMV ITS REAL  ITS ALIVEEEE
W A K E   M E   U P
I’ve watched this a million times already
Had to do a double take to see if I wasn't crazy seeing the title lol. Awesome trailer.
"My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold" while there is a spirit summon and the revenant casting an ice spell on screen is genius. 0:36
Between this and the Rehearsal I’m just glad evanescence is making money off the licensing
Whoever made this 100% knows their audience.
Interesting they paid the singer to use the songs.
Someone needs to show this to Moist Critical PLEASE
What on earth am I seeing and hearing????
One of the best character reveals I’ve watched. Everyone can agree that this brings out something from a the old AMV’s we use to watch
FROM SOFT JUST TELEPORTED US BACK TO THE 2000s MONTAGE TIMELINE, WE'RE GOING HOME BROS
i think i have a silver tear down my leg
I am…. SOLD!
Not in a million years did I expect evanescence, I thought this was a fan made trailer. Had to do a double take lmao. Honestly works great though
Evanescence really having a moment in the zeitgeist
This trailer makes me feel like I could safely land a plan in the Hudson
ABSOLUTE CINEMA
Bro...
Ok... not going to lie elden ring is my least favorite of all the souls/borne games I actually think it's pretty bad imo...but this trailer has even me like... I might get this
Ain't no way
You clap for Peak Fiction. You weep in sorrow before Peak Fiction. You stagger before Peak Fiction. You kneel before Peak Fiction.
AYO WHAT. This is so fucking funny I love it
Me: "Oh, that sounds like it could be the Evanescence song. I wonder why it's called that." *The hit song "Bring Me to Life" from "Fallen" by Evanescence begins to play* Me: "Sometimes the most obvious answer is the answer."
Big congrats to the AMV dudes of the early 2000s, cause they look like they're now in good positions in their respective jobs.
mucha esencia
ESENCIA??!!!!!
Actuall insanity
welcome back 2003
This game is so random I kinda have a love/hate feeling about it, this trailer kicks ass tho
Gonna be hard to top this for your next game @Fromsoftware
ESENCIA!!!
Thou shalt became EDGELORD by the Erdtree
WAKE ME UP
No chance, im here for it
Bring me to ultrawide 240 fps life ....
... very 2000-ish. I approve.
We got Elden Ring AMV before GTA 6
First the Devil May Cry Anime, and now Elden Ring. This is great
WE FUCKING MADE IT BOIS
Who came out with this gem????❤❤❤❤
The song choice warms my emo heart
Puta madre, farmeó aurea +2500
Above ground Eternal City alone is sick! AND with the tree in the distance?! That’s awesome!!!
I really hate it when people use old nu metal songs as part of  their marketing it just is so off-putting...
Someone messed up and posted their Morgott fan AMV to the official Bandai Namco channel
esto es clave
WAKE ME UP (CAN'T WAKE UP)
Fucking Amazing
We’re going back to ‘08 with this one 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥
Would have been better if the song was FE!N
Can't believe its just a day away lmao
NOW THIS IS FUCKING MARKWTING
New Nightfarer confirmed: Daredevil
This is a nightmare.
Joder cuanta escencia
and this is to go even futher beyond, 1 more bonus
Lmao😂
Anomalocaris
They did this with Dark Souls 1 as well
I thought this was another DLC, not a whole game
Esto es real!???
Absolutely peak and based.
OK it would've been funny if the trailer itself wasn't actually crap.
So recluse is INT build and revenant is FTH?
Broooo 😂😂
I remember watching the music video for this song on VHS right before Daredevil played. Good times
amv style video and music from 2000's? epic
Surprisingly fitting 😂
7 palabras🗿
This is cool as hell don’t get me wrong and I’m still probably gonna play it but no PvP? 🥲
This going on my MySpace page immediately.
Flashback to early childhood, goosebumps watching my favourite fight scenes to this song.
no way
broly flashed before my eyes watching this
7 palabras: E S E N C I A
Absolutely goated 😭😭
There should be an award for Game Trailers  We got Evanescence Wake me up Elden Ring Trailer before GTAVI
hell yeah
They knew what they were doing; they cooked with this!
Ah the memories
"Sorry boss I can't come in, I ate something and now my stomach is killing and I'm throwing up"
This guy def made BO2 edits 🔥
I know nor care jack about Elden Ring, but I love that late 2000s amv feel.
Big if true
I hate the music because it reminds me of my angsty teenage years but I love the game xD
yes. im in the right timeline. Elden ring x Evanescence.
are you fuckin serious rn
We are so back we are forward
NO WAY
im not even an elden ring fan but this goes so hard i love it
Don't think this is an official Bandai namco page.
OH MY GOD IT'S HAWK TUAH!!! 0:11
From's marketing team is on 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow this is the song that Sully Sullenburger was listening to when he guided that plane to a safe landing in the Hudson River!
What year is it?
QUE???!!! BRING ME TO LIFE EN ELDEN RING?!! ABSOLUTO CINE🚬🗿
EVANESCENCE WTF, i used to listen to this soundtrack back in the days 2004 and 2005 while playing Need for speed, hell yh
i read the title for the trailer and couldnt believe at any other time that they meant what i thought they meant.  somebody give marketing a raise
🔥🔥🔥
This is the best thing I've ever had the privilege of watching
Whatever sells it to the normies...
I had zero interest in this game. And damnit now I do. AMVs SLAP and this one is SO GOOD lmfao
the bitrate on this 1080p video was atrocious. Why and how is a multi million dollar game studio uploading trailers in 1080p and not 4k,
WAKE ME UP
I thought this was fanmade lmao
In the year of our elden lord 2025, evanescence having a resurgence into popular media, the children yearn for the 2000s edge!
Bro namco cannot stop cooking🙏
Well that wasn't on my bingo card 😂😅
I've watched this 10 times already! So hype!
The best trailer humans can create for AAA games
no way you used this song
The amount of nostalgia and memories that just surged back through me like a truck is overwhelming.
Simplesmente FODA!
Not even after hearing metal music in a Sonic game did I expect to see a FromSoft product advertised by Evanescence. Emos have been eating so good this year
初めて買ったアルバムがEvanescenceのFallenだった。 エルデンリングもEvanescenceも大好きだけど曲の雰囲気はあんまり合ってないかな笑 自分はまたこの曲にこんな風に出会えて嬉しいけどね☺️ 良くも悪くもファンメイドっぽいから Evanescenceを知らない世代には違和感あるだろうな〜
2000's are back baby!!!
Pay the metalhead intern that proposed this idea
I could not believe when I saw the title then the channel.
No fucking way
Peak
How about In The End by Linkin Park?
Drop the game already dammmnnn
Im going to get that Solaire skin.
I’m shocked by how much I love the doll already 💙
PEAK.
No way this is real. This is great!
AIN'T NO WAY
Early this morning I was doubting if buying the game or not, this has restored the hype in me
Haha targeted the exact age group of the og souls fans with that song 😂
I cant wait to see the next Vaati video explaining how the song ties into the lore..
Evanescence being back in 2025 was not on my bingo card XD
I can't believe this is real
BANDAI IS AMV POSTING ON MAIN?!?!?!
Man that brought me back to 2006
Alright this is peak! Fromsoft really having some fun with the side stuff love it .
Imagine thinking this is anything other than a money grab.
EPIC song choice‼️💯💪🏼
Broooooo give whoever made this trailer a raise for the music chose alone 🔥 🔥 🔥
ARE YOU KIDDING ME
Whoever made this, give them a raise IMMEDIATELY
Wtf bring me to life????!!!! Oh god you want to make me die
ain't no wayyyyyyyy
LMAO
so fye
i saw the title and thought there was no shot they were actually using the song and it would be a lore thing or smth, I even started singing the song under my breath as a joke but they're really doing it💀
I cancelled my preorder cause of this
Amped up !
This is fucking unreal LOL
ohom
I read the title and thought no way it's the song right? Someone promote the editor team.
The Mojave Miracle strikes again with a second plane.
Well dang this brings me right back to the old Bartholomew trailer for Dark Souls 1 all the way back in 2011 this is such a fun way to do one of these kinds of trailers again, though with much more finesse than any of the others that came before.
I sleep
YEEEESSSSS! I love Evanescence!
Nightmare On The Northside 3 by Scrim, World Domination by Murmur, or Blackhole by Architects... Would have been a badass theme song too for this game
Absolute AMV
this made me feel 12 again 😂
Now do a gangnam style trailer
Meh, no two-player co-op. Add that and then we'll talk
Evanescence and the fanbase is eating good this year, including me!
NO FUCKING WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
dude this is so cringe 👎
Bring me to life for Elden ring? Yea nothing topping that
Fucking legends
Here after the livestream. Now I understand why I must buy this game.
This video just unleashed my super saiyan power
Edge, Lord
What no fricking way what the flip
We do not want this krap,we don't want PvP and PVPE games,you destroyed Elden ring,we want single player experience, story, adventure
this song was released in 2003 but it's so timeless that it still slaps in 2025
Ok this song choice is FIRE!!!! Whoever it was on the team that did this deserves a raise!
???????
alright, im buying exclusively because of this AMV
Bro this is immaculate 🔥
This Trailer is the sole reason for my pre-order.
ngl an official Elden Ring VGMV released by Bandai Namco was NOT on my 2025 Bingo Card
00:52 goes so hard OMG
We need more Elden Ring AMVs!
You Focken wot m8?
We live in the most bizarre timeline
lmao
We're back in 2005 with this 🗣🔥🔥🔥
I can’t believe they got to partner with Nathan Fielder
I was genuinely like, "Bring me to life, wonder what that means?" Thought it might have been like a story trailer, did not expect that lol.
Top 10 strongest dragon ball characters ahh music
And I'm back in 2004
This sounds weird imo. The art of Elden Ring is too archaic for this type of a song.
This is PEAK!
Anybody else rock hard or is it just me? 😅
I miss this vibe when I watched amv !
Hell ya
feet 🤍
if you look close at the revenant, especially in that launch trailer. She has segmented joints. Almost like a living......doll.....
This is the hardest sh*t I've ever seen.
This is the coolest thing I’ve ever seen 😂
Close enough, welcome back machinima and mtv video mods
First DMC now Nightreign? Man Evanescence are for the GAMERS
Which one of you Gen Z interns did this ? Can you do it again ?
7 palabras esencia
There ain’t no way they used this song
Real ones remember the Dark Souls bartholomew trailer
😬
“You son of a 🐶 I’m in”
Well I sure as hell didn't have THAT on my bingo card.  Hello 2007, how ya been buddy?
THIS is how you make a videogame trailer. 🎵
Was pretty on the fence about buying this game. Not anymore. Rawest trailer OaT
Is quite enjoyable how they play LINKIN PARK and I think it suits the game pretty well They’re stuck in that place like a nightmare when they cannot go out when they wish to wake up from I think it’s the point that they need to regain their memories or I think
If I had a nickel for every time this song had been used in a recent piece of popular media I’d have two nickels… which isn’t a lot but it’s weird that it happened twice
coal
Game is absolutely horrible, refunded.
Man... I really wish I could buy the collector's edition but there's no shipping option for Brazil
video games are killing us boys. get off the dopamine box and start living life
Fromsoftware….never stop being you. Please.
Goku ssj 1000:
Elden Ring All forms AMV
weve gone full circle.
Dragon Ball AF x Elden Ring Nightrealm
ok
This is real trailer for a real video game on an official channel released in the year 2025.
i did not expect this
When I heard the first 3 notes I was in total disbelief.....I closed my eyes and smiled. I had to restart the video to actually see the trailer 🤣
cornball
BRIIIIINNNGGGG MEEEEEE TOOOOOOO LIIIIFFFFEEEEEE
This is corny as hell but i will admit it made me laugh.
put 144p and you got a perfect 2008 video.

Well, that was embarrassing
*This is not real…* *am I dreami-?* WAKE ME UP-
I love this
If this isn't one of the boss themes then I don't know what to say
directed by nathan fielder
Next video: Tarnished vs Duke's Dear Freja with Linkin Park background music
I for one can't wait for the Bloodborne 2 Trailer to feature Vangabus
Yes, indeed my fellow tarnished!! Rejoice all of us!!
can i ask, who is that girl? is she a new class in deluxe version?
Is this a joke?
You mad bastards throwing it back to the 00s with this banger. Bloodborne 1.5 HD Remix better have a trailer using All Star by Smash Mouth
someone allowed this and signed it  that someone is a legend
Ok fine fine ill buy Nightreign
using evanescense song its not gonna make me play this multiplayer crap come on fromsoft dont ruin ur games.
Is she some random conjourer? Spirit tuner like roderika? Or is she more michaela based? Would make for intresting classes a pure summons character, a character with power from michaelas abundance of grace?
Aura farming in a trailer 😭🙏
FromSoft: "Ok we need like one more trailer before it releases, anyone have any ideas"   One of the many wonderful people working at FromSoft: "Lets make the trailer a 2000's AMV with Evanescence's Bring Me To Life"  Someone else on the team "...idk if-"  FromSoft interrupts: "Hold on let them cook" XD
7 esencias, palabra
no fucking way
these needs to be watched in 360p to get the full 2006 amv vibe
This is hella gay, I love Elden ring, but gayyyyyeeeeee!
Es demasiada... E S C E N C I A 😈
This is making me want to start beef with the air bro
HORRÍVEL kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk até aqueles canais com 2k de inscritos faz melhor. Única coisa que salve é pq a música é boa pq de resto muito ruim, igual esse jogo aparenta ser.😊
Damn Nathan Fielder really has this much of a cultural reach huh?
This first thing that I was reminded of when seeing this was the Titanfall 2 Numb trailer
Evanescence X Elden Ring before GTAVI  Thumbs up for who experienced it first!
We are so fucking back
Hell yeah
Man the early 2000s were a different time. You couldn’t make a trailer like this today
This feels like the old youtube and I love it
guys wake up new AMV awards just dropped
Absolute Cinema ✋😐🤚
Actual peak
W song choice
well i didnt expect this
Next we need Linkin Park's In the End lol
No way did they use evanescence bring me to life in their trailer man i feel like im being brought back to 2007 again
0:52 EPIC
STUNNINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This trailer was so bad ass i got a refund for the game.
This made me sooooooo happy ...
absolute madlads
if you don't like this you are weak and will not survive the winter
peak
Bruh I’m sold
I did NOT expect to be teleported back to high school upon clicking this lol
This just turned into an AMV from 2007 lmao
AMV on main is legendary😂
2005 is so fucking back
We our now at that point in time where a ton of people who used to make Evanescence AMV edits back in the 2000s are now gainfully employed in industries that allow them to unleash their power upon the whole world. And it is freaking *MARVELOUS.* BRAVO FROMSOFT, ANOTHER BANGER HAS ARRIVED!
They went early 2000s with this.
I absoulutly Adore this it made me giddy with excitement
You gotta raise this marketing team's salary
I am beyond happy to see stuff like this happen, so nostalgic, I’m so hyped for this game
And why not Sleep Token?
SIETE PALABRAS ESENSIA
kino
Alright, alright. I'll pre-order the game.
7 Words 🗿
If solo isn't good or fun then its 2/10 for me 2 is only for the new bosses
Absolutely nailed this trailer!
(2000's Naruto amvs flashbacks)
goku base
What in the goddamn...?
Brother the amount of years you take me back with this trailer is crazy, great job.
10/fucking 10 song choice, I’m amped
7 PALABRAS ESENCIA
Good god! What year is it!
Welcome back, 00's AMV, just as beautiful as the day I lost you
Sully needs to play this
WAKE ME UP
7 Palabras..
narcolepsy medication commercials 15 years from now be like
This the most bizzare marketing choice I have seen in a while and I love Evanescence.
So The Revenant is incantations while tye Mage is sorcery
Goku all transformations powerl levels AMV 😭😭
I legit thought this was a meme edit until I double-checked the channel. Absolutely iconic choice of music!
Edge, Lord
Now make one with a Linkin Park song 😎
FromSoftWare Always Knew their fans.
Cinema
Badass
They're legit just missing a blue background and the video title in white text in 240p at the start of the the video.
dude there's no way. why does this go so hard  whoever's idea this was needs a raise
Has anyone else watched the rehearsal? The season finale was Sunday and the whole season ended to a performance of this song. So weird hearing this song twice in one week
If I wasn’t sold on nightreign before I think I’d be sold now
Total fan trailer that you would have seen back in the day lol awesome! Makes me want to try it out.
Enormously based song choice, amazing taste.
I thought the name was just coincidence and I was ready to make Evanescence jokes, boy did it surprised me
Bring Me To Life x Nightreign is such a PEAK COMBO 😭🙏
Lmao, is this 2006?!
Get Fromsoftware Team cyberpunk engine..   the horrible lighting tech is doing the incredible art team injustice
ABSOLUTE CINEMA 🖐️😯🤚
I love how much fun they seem to be having with this game 😁
We got evanescence in an Elden ring trailer before GTA 6
Wake me up  wake me up inside  wake me up  Wake me up at midnight to mor row night
which absolute fucking banter machine signed off on this trailer
This is the most halo 2 montage song I've ever heard.
Whaaaat
where Linkin Park Trailer
You have to do the Goku build with the Kamehameha (Azure Comet), build with ESSENCE
Holy peak.
sequel to my favourite game with one of my favourite songs!?!?!?!
Hay que hacer la build de goku con el kamehameha (cometa azur), build con ES E N C I A
Now I wait for Crawling trailer.
It’s so edgy.
this would've been better with sum war music or war drums or something other than this soft ish
LAWD they COOKED with this one!!!
CANT WAKE AAP
Over played corporate bullshit
Now you understand
I'm done. I'm DONE. I'M DONE. I'M COMPLETELY DONE. HOW YOU COULD HAVE DONE THIS 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 LMAO
Trailer guy knew the assignment
I did not have 'official channel makes an amv' on my bingo, congrats to the team on pulling that off.
BRAVO
No way they just dropped this heat on the official Bandai Namco page.
Insanely hard trailer, kudos to the marketing guy.
song is not needed 😂
Oh I'm sorry I thought this was just a small spin off I did not expect this much soul, my mistake.
I saw this appear in my recommended and actually said, “No way” out loud. Between this and the official lyric video for Afterlife by Evanescence being an AMV, I’m glad to see the band still so loved. And the AMV generation still doing their thing
my girlfriend said it best when I showed her this "what year is it??"
why does this feel more like cod zombies than modern cod zombies
BY THE NINE
Why animations keep looking so clunky tho😂
I read the title and didn't believe it. Watched the video and still can't believe it.
I'm back in middle school.
Fine I’m going to master this game
absolutely peak
talk about unexpected LOL
...wait... is this _actually_ the trailer? And not a shitpost??
SOVL
wtf, am I back in time or something? feels like 2008 all over again
Cringe af...
1:13
The first thing I thought when I saw the title and its possible meaning: GODWYN!?
No way they actually used the song
**Palworld use monster glider** Nintendo: IT SUEING TIME.  **Elden Ring use monster glider** Nintendo: I sleep.
Yo whaaaat? 🤣
Cinema
Okay now do one with Breaking the Habit from Linkin Park
This song was garbage in 2003 and it's garbage now.
Asset flips upon asset flips.  I hope they dont expect full price for this.
DA UM AUMENTO PRO ESTAGIARIO
Hello? Based department?
DMC newer anime and this seem to know what people want in a trailer aka make it a AMV
Me and the Bois are so fuckin ready
You think Sully was watching this trailer in the cockpit before pulling of the miracle on the Hudson?
GENIAL
I was expecting only the name and the comments to be full of references, I was NOT expecting the actual song. This also reminds me of that edit someone made I think it's called "if elden ring was directed by Michael Bay" or something.
First DMC now this, Evanescence putting in work this year
is ts tuff in the lands between? 🥀🥀🙌
ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN「GMV」
Oh god.. You got me..
This is awesome!!!
Its so peak
AIN'T NO WAY...  I FREAKING LOVE THIS TRAILER.
Pure kino.
Bring back 2000s era
amazing trailer
They got anime op for this game???? Dayum
TELL ME WHY - PENPALS??? PLEASE
🔥🔥🔥 elite choice of music @BandaiNamcoEntertainment 🔥🔥🔥
Absolute cinema, we have reached peak fromsoft.
WELCOME BACK NUMETAL AMVS
Perfect music choice lol
This feels like a fan edit 🤣
Someone needs to remake this trailer with the Goofy version of this song lol
ON THE OFFICIAL CHANNEL?!?!?!? NO WAY
Is the next trailer gonna have Linkin park or 30 seconds to Mars?
1 more day guys
And so, the Internet law of Bring me to life AMV’s claims another franchise. However, this time it’s official 😂
Laughed at the music choice, good stuff.
Remind "True Colors" and "Familiar"  souls trailers vibes.
FINALLY... THE DARK SOULS OF AMVs.....
this is wild lmaooo. Not on my bingo card
I am now excited for Elden Ring Nightreign
I actually can't believe what I just saw
I saw "Bring me to Life" in the title and thought "Hah, that title makes sense for this game but it sounds like that song, I'm sure the comments are going to be filled with people pointing it out" and then it started playing
I can't stop laughing bro, this is genius.
Dude this is actually fucking amazing
BRUH
The Naruto AMV guys are moving up in the world.
You didn't slip those foot shots past me unnoticed Miyazaki.
Millennials rise up!
company so chopped ai done turned them bankrupt
GOAT editor
... why this silly song tho?
We’ve done it, we have officially reach *PEAK* 🤣🤣🤣
THE HARDEST TRAILER I HAVE SEEN
wait WHAAAAT
Don't forget to rate the video 5 stars
E S E N C I A
This is exactly the motivation I need before playing this game!
I just watched the finale of The Rehearsal ... and now this.
Flawless, incredible
Goes Hard
Incredibly based
What an amazing trailer! This was horrible. Congratulations.
icl, this was so peak
PEAK
Bring Me to Life x NightReign was not on the bingo card but I am not mad at it. Legends
I can only imagine non-millenial/non-Western viewers will be utterly confused by this Comments section.
Nathan Fielder using this for his show was better and funnier, tbh.
O _O XD
I have many questions but shall receive no answers
What is this amv ahh trailer 💀💀💀💀
They knew we’d love it
bring me to life in 2025 go crazy
Absolutely no way someone approved this fan edit AMV release LMAOOO
We got Emo rock AMV music in Elden Ring before GTA6
Evanescence!?  Hell yeah... Next one should Creed!
FromSoftware is a Damn Genius! Absolutely Beautiful.
On this night, we will reign.
I saw the title and had to watch lol
Never had I gotten such whiplash in my entire life.  I was NOT expecting that song to play in a Souls Game trailer.  10 / 10 Marketing
This being official is both hilarious and amazing, props to Bandai and Evanescence for both being awesome.
So does this confirm Anomalocaris as the 10th wayfarer?
Stfuuuuuuuuuu hahahahaha no way this is amazing. First Devil May Cry and now Fromsoft? Straight 2000s early YouTube amv energy in here 😂❤
Amo los amvs
Well now... This isn't somethng i was expecting but its definitely quite pleasing.
❤❤❤❤
Yeah trailer itself is cool, but using unexpected AMV format in 2025 was stolen from recent dmc adapt.
Omg, this is the best song they could have chosen… like ever ❤
what timeline are we in.
POV: AMY LEE INVADES YOUR WORLD AND OHKOS YOU WITH THE MOONVEIL KATANA
Wow Evanescence may have a major come back thanks to this!😂
I thought this was fanmade wtf
Welp just when I thought this game couldnt get any worse.
Theme music is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Didn't expect to hear Evanescence in a FromSoft trailer, but I'll take it!
Ain't no way
I can feel my Club Penguin coins increasing...
Elden Ring and Evanescence!!! LETS GOOOO 🩵🩵🩵
I heard Captain Sully bought this game after watching this trailer.
“BRINGGGGGGG MEEEEEEEE TOOOOOO LIIIIIIFFFFEEEEEE”
Evanescence and Devil May Cry and now Evanescence with Elden Ring Nightreign lol
W song choice
Toilet seat type ass
Great music choice! My mind is made up after this.
The Rehearsal reference?!
Omg Revive the 2000 again
absolute cinema 🤚😐✋
I had to check the channel to see if this was official.
Revenant has the best aura farm of any character bc of the song
Absolute freaking geniuses at Marketing. Please 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
so this banger is gonna be on the game's OST, right??
caballero esclavo gael fases 1-20
OMFG THEY DEAD ASS USED THIS SONG LMAOOOOOOOO 10/10!
hard asf
HOLY
Fromsoft is just perfection at this point 😂
THIS IS SO AWESOME!
this goes unbelievably hard
OMG this is the best thing ever 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
BIONICLES ARE SO BACK
Man i am clearly not inmune to propaganda
Guys remember to thank Netflix DMC for this. The show may not have been good but it pulled the early 2000s AMV era BACK INTO THE PRESENT! thank you Doontay
Aw yeah, a ‘00 classic. Did not expect an Elden Ring x Evanescence crossover but I can’t think of a better theme song for Revenant.
300 IQ Marketing Moment
NARUTO VS SASUKE - BRING ME TO LIFE AMV
I saw the trailer title, and I was like, no fucking way, scared excited it was going to be just this, and it was. Definitely the timeline I want to be in, lmao
ALRIGHT, FROM OR WHOMEVER DID THE MARKETING! YOU WIN!
memelords confirmed
This got me off guard   ABSOLUTE CINEMA!! 👐
THE AMV KID IN ME IS  SCREAMING
you got me, this is Gaming.
ES DEMASIADA ESENCIA AAAAAAAAAA
Sully Sullenberger approves this trailer
this  is sick
Bring me to Life and Elden ring? This isn't real -checks the user-  . . .  -double checks User-   . . .. well damn
This trailer puts such a smile on my face.
Hell yeah
I can't wait to dodge roll and press right button.
This is the kind of video someone deserves to be fired over.
I was quietly thinking oh those first few notes are very Evanescence coded, nice touch to a classic  Then it was just evanescence and I lost my collective mind
That Evanescence DMC trailer did something to the time line i swear it did
PEAK
7 PALABRAS, E S E N C I A
Your mom: You can't make money off of those silly lil amvs Them probably: And I took that personally.
last thing i expected
THIS JUST WORKS AND IM DOWN FOR IT!
they created an AMV of their own game
ABSOLUTE CINEMA
Fucking Legend
I imagine some Japanese editor found the song and translated the lyrics innocently.
nem fodendo
Nathan Fielder?
Love the DBZ AMVs with songs like this.
peak
Me siento devuelta en 2012
Siete palabras....
Wake the me the fck up in 2025!!!
I love this.
I hope there’s an option to play that song during the game
Reminds me of all those AMVs on youtube from like 2006
ts tuff
i cannot put into words how much this happiness this gave me.
I saw this on Reddit. Just the link as some fan made thing  I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS REAL
This could have been the music for the Sparking Zero trailer 😔
An AMV straight from 2010. Noice!
Was not expecting evanescence to be in the trailer. Now I want this game even more!!😭❤️
Remember, if Sully Sullenberger can land a plane in a high pressure situation, you can clutch out a win with your friends no matter the odds.
Cash grab game with reused sh*t. People will always simp for nostalgia. "YES I CAN'T WAIT TO FACE BOSSES I ALREADY BEAT WITH WEAPONS I'VE ALREADY USED AND PAY FOR IT AGAIN!!!!" Game will die in a month. This game gives me massive s*icide k*ll the justice league vibes
✋🚬🗿🤚
Woah
Does it play tomorrow Thursday 9:00pm?
this hyped up Morgott mor than anyone else
Primero Sandstorm en el trailer de Sand Land y ahora Bring Me to Life en el traiiler de Elden Ring, el carajo de Marketing tiene buenos gustos
How do you unlock Sully
I wasn't prepared for Evanescence x Elden Ring istg
Man, this has that fan edited amv type vibe.
In a world where all kinds of studios, devs, publishers, and managers are making all the wrong decisions, these guys only make the best decisions The contrast is insane

I don’t think that Bandai and Fromsoft realize how they just created a trailer that will go on to have people cosplaying, and buying this game just because of said trailer for years to come 😅

Shout out to the bad ass employees who worked on this. We see you.
Gaming AND music are healing.

BEST Trailer ever!!!!
Loving the revenant reveal trailer
Harder daddy~
the last time i hear 'bring me to life' being used in AMV was 'naruto vs orochimaru full fight AMV' back in 2010 😂
Der Kino
Nathan fielders reach is incredible
Man feel like i am back in 2000's
really good grades
Whoever made the decision to make this trailer, keep cooking
Absolutely Crazy!!! Never would have been on my bingo card!
I can't believe people like this. This is so stupid lmao. People actually like this? This is so cringe it hurts, the comments and this trailer.
Formsoftware's advertisement game just peaked
trailer directed by Nathan Fielder
What the hell? What year is it?
Turning Elden Ring into a slop game should've been expected i guess. Art turns into content.
Shout out to the eagle “squaaaw!!”
I can't believe Miyazaki landed a plane on the Hudson while listening to this
man how far fromsoft fell
Damn I didnt know Miyazaki was chill like that
LMAO I DONT BELIEVE IT
Hell yeah, the trailer
I read the title and said "isn't that the title of that Evanescence song" only to watch it and answer to myself witha big "OF COURSE IT FUCKING IS 🗣️🔥"
Es mucho cine
american marketing team gone rogue
Has to make sure this was the official account for a second lol

holy freak i have GOT to share this on my MySpace page
AMV ? WE ARE SO BACK
Why this song. why....
2012 vibes lol
Alright alright I was on the fence I'm fucking in just because of the trailer music
As someone who refuses to let go of the early 2000s this goes so hard
Won’t be surprised to hear Linkin Park whenever they start promoting the DLC
Now I'm waiting for a Linkin Park video
Thank you for holding a gun to my head and forcing me to preorder right now
captain sully hyped about this trailer
What’s with the song? Does not fit at all.
Peak Fiction
wow
This is how captain Sully landed the plane
Whoever picked the song needs a massive raise for sure
Can a lore Youtuber please do a deep dive on the song in this trailer? Is this supposed to be Miquella singing to Radahn?
Someone at FromSoft did watch Season 2 of The Rehearsal.
Nathan Fielder did it first
When I read the title I was already making jokes. Then when I clicked on the video my reaction was: "WAIT, IS IT ACTUALLY?? WHY- ACTUALLY NEVERMIND, THAT'S FUCKING AWESOME"
Amazing trailer, incredibly surprised by the song by the way. -- Expecting a great time playing with friends this masterpiece, finally.  gotta be honest, would love to have 4 ppl squad, but still!!!  Let's rock!
Based
EVANSCENEEEEEE LETS GOOOOOO ORAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Welcome back 2010. How I missed you.
This brings me back to the very late 2000s and early 2010s where I would be watching edits on youtube with that song.   Thank you Fromsoft and Bandai Namco. This is peak!
The sound of clicking on a random gaming video on YouTube in 2007
2000/2010 is back ?!  Same vibe, like the DARK SOULS Bartholomew trailer, and never other trailer of fromsoft like Bartholomew my hyped like him, but this, is finnaly the seconde !.
I heard Captain Sully watched this before landing on the Hudson.
6.6k views and 9.5k likes lol
aura nuke.
Man i don't even play this game but here am I
We got official Elden Ring AMV's before GTA 6.
Of all the things I expected, this wasn't one of them lmaoo. Take me back to 2000s!!!
*sigh* Fromsoftware are done arent they
I’ve never laughed at a trailer so hard before, that was such an amazing music choice
We are so fucking back. AS NIGHT FALLS, WE RISE
Absolute cinema, I'm buying this game now
This will go down as one of those S-Tier trailer decisions of all time. Like the OG MW2 trailer with Till I Collapse by Eminem. Like a youtube montage come to the main stage. That 'ELDEN RING: NIGHTREIGN' with the guitar riff...chills. See you in Limveil, fellow nerds.
W marketing
…got any ideas?
modern gaming is so back
They saved the best for last.   Cinema.
Goes hard
First Devil May Cry now Elden Ring?? Love to see Evanescence get a lot of love recently!
Amazing song. but unfortunately, very unfitting.
7 PALABRAS E S E N C I A
NO SHOT.....EVANESCENCE and elden ring?! WE BACK CUH
Not quite the song I expected to hear.  The again, I wasn’t expecting to hear “True Colors” for the DS3 trailer so I guess it’s par for the course.
I can't believe we got an Evanescence x Elden Ring trailer. Dev team really going back to 2008 AMVs
?????????????????
This plays when you drop in as revenant btw.
Sully Sullenberger, is that you?
Re-watched this video several times to be sure of what I was seeing.
LOL they used Evanescence...
A stroke?  Am I having a stroke?  Is it 2006 again?
Have y'all ever seen somebody lean into a shitpost so hard it wrapped back around?  Apart from the obvious, I mean.
Alright, Bandai, I see you've researched your market well (atleast in my case lol) . But I'm broke as hell rn. Maybe a couple of months later I'll check it out after some updates have cleaned up the gameplay.
Couldn't believe my eyes. The 2000's Dare Devil music video is all I can really see.
So where is Goku here?
Sully approves this trailer
YEAH!!!
This comes way out of left field but I absolutely fucking love it, this just confirms that they forsure COOKED with this game
this was a welcome Suprise
Already preordered but this 100% would have sold me if I hadn't.
23 seconds
Unironically Kino. We must RETVRN to early 2000's Youtube.
Evanescence in this economy?

HELL YEAH💯🦅🔥
They have awakened all of us born in the 90s
Evanescence hype
lmaooooo
15 years ago who knew making AMVs would become an effective marketing strategy, and yet here we are.
The goth character, getting the one song to play on her reveal trailer in an AMV style edit. Whoever did this, thank you.
Is this a fever dream?     Wake me up
0:54 🔥WAKE ME UP🔥
Vaati, where does Evanescence fit before or after the Golden Order?
Is this a Cannon AMV?
We had Margit. Then there was Morgott. Now we face Morgood.
I was not planning to buy this game now I am
I genuinely can't believe this is a real trailer that I'm watching in the year 2025. Whoever put this together has my l love and respect 🫡
Revenant Trailer, low-key lmao
Ong reminds me of my amv making days. This is peakkkkk
this is so funny and so kino
In an era of tone deaf publishers, how did they manage to do everything right!? WAKE ME UP.
This is like every 2009 GMV but somehow official. _This timeline is not so bad after all..._
I will now buy your game
you don't have to try this hard, I already pre ordered!!!!!! :)
2025 has been a fucking wild ride so far.
Yup it’s sealed Revenant Main 🥶😮‍💨

Evanescence!? At this time of the decade, at this time of the year, at a game trailer, localized entirely within Elden Ring ?! ... Can I see it?
Lol somebody must have recently sold or gained their masters. They popping up everywhere recently
we got nightreign AMV before GTA 6
When you're the tarnished but you also have to save 155 souls by landing on the Hudson
you know, if it can work for devil may cry, why not hire Evanescence again for elden ring.
Science: Time travel is impossible Elden ring: here you go now you are in 2008 again.
You guys are nuts
Help, can't stop re-watching this trailer 😹
Damn Im old
Raise your hand if you recognize the song from the 2000 Daredevil Ben Affleck movie 🙌
Wow, amazing trailer! And I was listening to this song a few hours ago so this is quite a coincidence.
damn i did not expect this song 10/10
Yo, is this the year 2008? We just making machinima music videos.
the fact this doesn't have a big copyright stamp on it means fromsoft or bandai paid for this what crazy universe Im I living in!??!?
Dang that was sweet!
ok now we have to make a video showing all the elden ring characters with this song
wtf? lmao
Like the old .vhs video on YT early days 😂
Praying Vaati brings this up in a lore video.
certified gaymen moment
having just finished watching "the rehersal" on HBO, this song is such a weird choice...amy lee is making a comeback in 2025?
This is epic
I hate this song so much.

The last thing I'd expect for an Elden Ring-adjacent trailer, but man. It works!
This is the highest level of camp, you are doing it right here. Elden Ring Nightreign FMV is real!
Decent trailer, I liked the Shadow of the Erdtree ones better though
It makes a lot of sense, with the flying and all.

NO FUCKING WAY, WHAT THE HELL LMAOOO
It's peak.

Ten years ago this would have been a meme. A good one, too.  Today, in the Lord’s year 2025, it’s dead serious. And people love it.
Someone at Bamco clearly a Nathan Fielder fan and I’m all here for it
I wonder if this is part of the official soundtrack. 😊

Wow I really didn't expect a GMV form  an official channel well I guess you guys are in "trying new things" arc 🙏
This can't be a real ad
LETTTTSSS FUCKING GOOOOO!!!!
Miyazaki to trailer music guy: "we've come a long way since Bartholomew & All Saints Day." Trailer music guy: "Time to show my true power!"
THIS IS CINEMA!!!!
No way Bandai dropped an OFFICIAL AMV trailer. this is peak. take notes game companies

Wtf was Miyazaki thinking? It's incredibly awesome
Still won't buying that slop.
ITS SO PEAK
LOOKS LIKE PEAK IS BACK ON THE MENU, BOYS
HOW IS SO MUCH PEAK EVEN POSSIBLE!!!!!!!
The video description makes it even better
You forgot to add GMV in the title.
This will be dark souls graphics in 2014

i feel like im watching a early runescape pk video

10/10 no notes. Perfection.

The world is healing it seems.
I really went from just screaming laughing at this song choice to just staring at the screen like “hang on… it’s peak???”
It was cool but I was laughing through the first watch cause I truly didnt not expect this song
Now this is a  trailer that  gets you  hyped
No one's expecting but there should beee yohrn the giant ..... Becz the storm rullerrrr is comingggggg backkok
What's the point of making a cheaper game if you're going to have a marketing budget that's twice the games budget?
I will forever associate this song with that Megaman.EXE AMV I made about two decades ago.  That aside: only about 22 hours to go, lads.
WAKE ME UP 🗣🗣🗣
We have an official Elden Ring AMV before GTA VI
Wake me up

its so peak
bu ne la :D
holy based
Why the garbage music? Original score would have been preferred.  Had to watch this on mute.
You forgot the end credits with blue background with basic text animation and an unregistered hypercam 2 watermark throughout the video
Ok well two of my favorite franchises just used Evanescence songs, which is wild
this is what happens when miyazaki is not on the director seat lmao
I wasn't particularly interested in this game before, but now I'm kind of considering it. A+ marketing, whoever came up with this idea, give them a raise immediately! 😂
First sandstorm in the sand land trailer and now this give whoever is in charge of the music choices needs a raise
This is illegal. Did a teenager make this trailer cause, if not, this should be banned from the platform. Where is the flat color and white text telling us who made the video, the artist and song? We used to have culture!

Shut up! Who did this? If FromSoft actually making impressive stuff for once didn't have me sold on buying Nightreign, this would have. Sure, its way out of FromSoft's tone, but fits the visuals at the same time.
Alright I'll give it up

This is so 2003, I love it!
uh, based?
This is just.... not expected. This is gaming peak
Channeling the 2000s AMV energy. I am all for this.
What the hell??? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I was never able to understand the "satisfaction of playing a game that literally want to troll you and bully you since Dark Soul 1" And then came Elden Ring with Coop but  if you invite your friend then you open the door for the player to do the same as the game, troll and bully you when you just want to enjoy their vision with a friend. So when I saw Elden Ring: Nightreing I was telling myself this is perfect me and my mate are use to Fortnite and it will be in the world of From Software" but they decide to make it 1 player or 3 players. I swear this company is build by bullies from my 5th grade. It's their lost we won't buy again.
It's so beautiful...

Damn we got ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN x bring me back to life before gta6
I saw the title of the video and I thought it would be something else. I thought “oh it’d be funny if it was that one song” and low and behold it was that song lol
Wrong music lmfao
Bandai still using garbage music for Fromsoft game trailers.. smh
MY HEART IS FULL AF RN
Best trailer by far
THE CREATOR OF THIS VIDEO NEEDS TO GET A PROMOTION ASAP

As if this new direction wasn't lame enough...
I was not expecting to hear this song LMAOOOOOOOOO
The cultural impact of Nathan Fielder is being felt across the world
No fucking way we get a AMV for Elden Ring 😂😂
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHhahahahahahahHahahahahahahahahaaa
Fromsoft knows their player base better than I know my dad
First is Afterlife in Studio Mir's DMC, and now this? Now this is FIRE! 🔥🔥🔥

Classic Shrek song 💕
One of the most hilarious pre-release trailer in my entire life
No way this trailer is real YEAHHHHHHHH
WHOS IDEA WAS THIS LMAO
Do more of these
I was absolutely NOT expecting this but definitely appreciated 😂
oh so its *peak* peak. got it.
This is surreal
was this entire game a shitpost
was the budget 10 dollars
from softwear making a GMV was not what I was expecting to see before GTA 6
P peak trailer definitely dropping $100
Nightreign AMV coming straight outta 2005. I fkin love it 🤣
Trailer is 🔥🔥
We need, Last Resort version with Executor!
lol
This felt like watching those super old bionicle ads
I HEARD ONE NOTE
THERE'S NO WAY
WHAT?
Absolute Cinema!
The only song people used to make edits with before memes, TikTok, and Phonk — those were legendary days. [AMV]
That song always takes me all the way back to No Way Out 2003
I love it, release the game already!
revenant and her two scary guard dogs.
HOLY PEAK
NAW WHAT
This seems like something I would have downloaded from Limewire in 2004
This paired with that feels like I just stepped into a minute and thirty-one second time rift of 2006
what timeline are we living in that bandai namco official posts a trailer with that song
Elden Ring AMV
This feels more like a fan edit than an official trailer
What amount of *E S E N C I A.*
AND IT'S ALL GAMEPLAY FOOTAGE
All the dudes that made nu metal AMVs in the mid 2000's have grown up and are now working in the industry
PEAK!!!
Deeeeos que edgy, me vengoo 🤭
Me atrapaste, definitivamente cine 🚬
Had to reread the title a few times. I just got one question: Where’s are the transformations?
This would’ve done gang busters in 2012
I feel like I could land a 737.
Cute parody account. Wait.
WHAT YEAR IS IT
0:52 peak…
This is so Random i love it 😂😂😂
we're so back
*checks to make sure this is the bandai namco channel and not a fan AMV* 😂
The world is healing
I had better hear Paralyzer for the launch trailer
i don't even go here but this is peak knowing ur audience.
Elden Ring anime opening
I beg your finest pardon? WHAT!!!?????
I can’t believe I didn’t live to see this day!
ofc they got feet in the first 20 seconds LMAO. 0:21
WHAT YEAR IS IT?
I clicked because I thought "They better be playing Evanescence's song with a title like that" and a few seconds in, they didn't disappoint.
WTF IS HAPPenING 😂
CHAT, IS THIS REAL?!?!
Man what a cringe. I felt like watching badly cut AMV video that some guy with less than 100 views per video add to his channel and add the most blank music possible thinking it will sounds epic
Peak🔥 pre order 2months before
This... wasn't on my bingo card
Evanescence? In the year of our lord 2025???  This is peam.😭👌
Amy Lee ♥♥
Look at what they did to my boy :(
Yes, yes, yes, yes yes!!!! That's just it
WHAT???????
This looks like a fan made trailer wtf
Of course America does this. I get prouder every day
Naruto vs Sasuke final battle AMV
She’s beautiful and great song!
I  hope whoever made this possible is credited and celebrated until the day they cease to live, unironically great
this has the exact same energy as adi shankar playing green day in that devil may cry show of his 😐
This is peak internet
Great song for a great title. Can’t wait to go back into more Elden Ring.
Can y'all make it where this version has special events or boss fights and your rewards are gesture's new abilities/weapons, titles and or clothes for the OG elden ring that would be amazing to see something like the nameless king's attire,weapons and or clothes 😮😮
feels like 2007
Someone on the marketing team 100% used to make AMVs and is using their position and budget to make the most self-fulfilling and based choices.
pov: you are watching AMVs in 2007
Well that’s something the song just played on the radio before I got back from work
Is this the daredevil movie?
AMVs are back on the menu
Congratulations Bandai, you've truly outdone yourself this time.
We got Evanescence in Elden Ring before GTA 6
E L D E N P E A K
WHAT F'ing YEAR IS IT
Now make one with crawling in my skin.
Perfect 😢
Banger bangerr!
Okay, they're just having fun and I'm here for it! ❤

So did FromSoftware just give up?
OMG I LOVE IT ❤

This is sick
Holy fucking peak
Now do Elden Ring x Sleep Token!
We bringing the 2000s back
WHATTT
I don’t know why this was made but it’s absolute cinema
From Soft B Team: "Let's make a game that just mashes up a bunch of nostalgia from past souls games together!" The one brooding millennial emo on the team: "I heard someone say... *nostalgia.* "
Not convinced by this game at all tbh. Could be their first "meh, it's alright".
I know this sounds lame but honestly? This is kinda historical in the internet space, I'm glad I have witnessed such a monumental  occasion.
Getting [PROTOTYPE] opening cutscene flashbacks
K P Y T O . ниче не скажешь
ITS SO ABSOLUTELY PEAK
What is this? what's happening?
It took me a second that this was a legit trailer in my feed... I thought I went back to the mid-2000's Youtube era where people were posting their edgy AMV's using this song again. 😆 Can't wait for Nightreign, tho!
LMAO
This feels like a fan made trailer lmao. Nothing wrong with that though.
I read the title and thought "there's no shot they used Evanescence for a trailer...", lo and behold, they did, AND IT'S PEAK
Absolute Cinema
Holding back on the Revenant to give her the honor of a *"Bring Me To Life" trailer in 2025* is peak. I was laughing and smiling through this whole thing.
Tarnished margit saga vs radahn ( conscious ) powerlevel ahhh
banger
What did I just watch?
Peak video game moment 🔥
Guys will see this and say "hell ya".
Pero cuánta esencia...
???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
reddit aids 🖕😂
ESENCIA
When your video director is a millennial that misses the 'AMV' era of Youtube.
Noooo hahahah this is awesome!!
The most emo-goth character gets the most emo music from the 2000's.. it fits
Can’t wait to have an AMV of Fortissax with Time of dying
Beyond peak. It’s like an AMV. I would play this song when I was stuck on a boss in DS1 when I was a teenager. Incredible work.
Imagine showing this to someone back when we were wondering what Fromsoftware's next game would be
Insane lmao
What a song choice!
How is this real?
Imagine this coming up after you finish watching the daredevil movie instead, and having zero clue what you're seeing at all.
get those nasty dogs off my screen
guys.. its peak
raw
Que pedo
Alright, gotta say I didn't see this song choice for a video game trailer in 2025 coming
W
They really made a unironic 2000s naruto X Sasuke in the valley of Destiny AMV for elden ring
Kino
This is….something
1:12 it’s Pricilla from ds1 and ds3.
OMG the memes.
I thought it was just a meme but here we are. Hell yeah 10/10 taste in music.
ABSOLUTE CINEMA
So cringe
Absolute Cinema 🙌
that like to dislike ratio is insane, almost everyone liked it
Whats goin on!!??? are we back to 2000's AMVs trend already?
No, Fromsoftware. This song doesn't make your cashgrab game look "cool".
This is crazy lmao
Directed by Nathan Fielder
this was everything.
PEAK PEAK
I've watched this three times now and I still cannot believe it is real.
directed by adi shankar
Oh my god
You've got to be kidding me with this music choice
hahahahaha awesome
Had to make sure i was on the right channel oh wow
Last time Bandai made a music video for one of their games was with Agnes Obel’s song Familiar for Dark Souls 3: The Fire Fades Edition lol, and before that a few other songs for DS2.  I did not expect them/Fromsoft to do it again for Nightreign after they skipped it for the base game and DLC lol.  Not that I’m complaining. Bring Me to Life is definitely a fitting song for this game and its themes
No, not modern rock music pls. Classic orchestra and church music is the most suitable and only choice
1:03 I know what you want.
It occurs to me that some people might not know what an AMV is, so they would see this with no hint of irony.
???????????????? What the hell??????????????????
7 PALABRAS E S E N C I A
Heh from soft changing up their marketing a bit eh?
Volvimos a 2008?
this so peak
Someone in the marketing team suggested this as a joke, but the project manager took it seriously.
I legit did a triple take when I saw this! What a fever dream! Have I lived long enough to see the meme come full circle? Is this the Evanescence redemption tour?!  Also From Software, let me know if you need an extra video editor for these trailers. I been dropping GMVs like this since the 2010s! Apparently, I'm overqualified now lol!
Excuse me?? What is actually going on here?
Good God, I feel old.
AYOOOOOO
Holy moly Revenant is so cool
PEAK, whoever made this trailer is a God amongst Man.
fromsoft really made an amv without even trying
Why do I feel like the Netflix Devil May Cry show is partially responsible for this existence?
SSJ2 Gohan AMV ahh music😭✌️
Let them boys COOK!
This trailer pwns xD
NO WAY
What world is this that such a thing can be? 👀
Now do Linkin Park
Revenant is a confirmed Cunibyo
posting this to my livejournal
Stupid music
Executor going alpha mode soundtrack
Who ever signed off on this trailer is an absolute legend
I can't believe they actually use this song I smell PEAK
Cinema
So tuff...
Hell yea simulator
Please add mimic tear as a character class
Yeah , stop farming aura, and revive us bro
BRING ME TO LIFE 🗣‼️
No amount of boomer nostalgia is gonna make me play this game but I’m here for the memes
Looks like I'm adding Evanescence to my fromsoft playlist.....
Guess who just became OP. Damn.
this is corny but whatever.
Whoever is on the marketing team is a genius
XD
Are we for real right now
Reminds me the Bartholomew trailer for the first dark souls
xddddddddddddd
Absolute Cinema
ABSOLUTE CINEMA
Nightreign + Bring Me to Life is fucking PEAK
WAKE ME UP
Peak marketing
Now do Maroon-Animals for executor.
This entire game feels like an ambitious fan mod, so this is the perfect trailer song selection lol
BEAR witness the greatest game of 2026
I love the fact that they used this song brings me back to my childhood
This is the funniest unironic thing I've seen in a long time. I love it
Would have been perfect if the game used was Bloodborne 2.
😂 Feels like 2007 youtube, FromSoft is core
I can't stop rewatching. Pre-ordered long ago, but damn... We're back in our 2007.
Holy hell this is the sickest trailer i have ever seen. I could land a 737 in the Hudson to this.
It is 2005 and I am watching Evanescence AMVs. It is 2025 and I am watching Evanescence AMVs.
Does anyone remember the True Colors song they choose for that Ds3 trailer? They love mixing music that creates a juxtaposition to the gameplay and visuals.
We got a souls game using “Bring me to life” in their trailer before GTA 6
MY WALLET IS SLEEPING SOMEWHERRRRRRE COLD
lmao
I expected Goofy to be the one singing it
ale guwno
First The Rehearsal and now Elden Ring. Thank you, Sully.
Never fucking use this song again
joder fromsoft esto si que es ESENCIA
Wings of Voice brought me here
You know what hell yeah I'm buying
First DMC now Elden ring. Thank you Evanescence.
Holy crap, what year is this again? We're doing official FMV's now?
LETS GOOOOOO
Is this 2005!? The only thing missing is "Naruto amv" in the title.
I was NOT PREPARED
Hell yeah
Oh you've gotta be kidding
word
I was transported to the 2010's with the Bionicle commercials thanks to this trailer...  Thank you Bandai
Wow are they that desperate lol this game is a dumpster fire already XD
Most unexpected song choice ever 😭
lmao just read the title and I couldn't believe it!!! it's the actual song!
OMAIGAD, ESTO VA A SER EPICO PAPUS!
ya it’s 2010
✋😐🤚 ABSOLUTE CINEMA
Esto si es E S E N C I A
SUCH PEAK
...is it 2008?
Well no turning back now, you better get the All American Rejects for the duskblood launch trailer bandai
This was not on my bingo card. I love this.
I was lowkey waiting for goku SS10
Like naruto in the 00's
Describe peak in one video:
Nuff said. I'm in x 10000000
No lie; wasn't expecting it to go this hard.
Don't listen to the haters. This is how you do marketing.
WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS?????
In my 30 years on this good earth, never would I have ever known to expect the OFFICIAL BANDAI NAMCO YOUTUBE CHANNEL to post an AMV trailer for their upcoming game with Bring Me To Life as the backing track. I tip my hat to you, Bandai, for embracing the memes
The mad men actually did it
Reminds me of the baaraki bionicle trailer which is something I didn't think I'd be reminded of in elden ring of all places
I'm speechless. I honestly cannot tell if this is cringe or based.
WAKE ME UP
RELEASE THE ELDER EMOS
El pan de ayer no está tan duro. El pan de ayer 🗿:
Okay From I will buy your game
They're the only ones who could do this
i cant listen to this and not remember BIONICLE
This is so campy I love it
NGL probably the worst trailer FromSoftware has ever put out lol. Song choice is so off putting and the gameplay isnt as cinematic and cool as their other trailers.
Reminds me of the Dark Souls 2 trailer with Locomotive Breath.  Love it
HELL YEAH
The early-mid 2000s AMV energy I’m getting from this 😭
NO WAY THIS SONGGGGGG
man that's that early 2000's AMV energy
Evanescence is popping off with game collaborations lately
What? Lol
Guys what timeline are we in?
This was definitely a revenant promotion video
Nathan fielder your impact
Interesting song choice. Didn't expect that!
Its good to be back bois
YEESSSSS!!!
What year am I in rn, 2009???
SAAAAVEEEE MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
THE REVENAAAANT, IIIIII NEEEEED IIIIIT!!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Should've been the Goofy cover.
00:00 this is the Nokron on the ground!
WHAT YEAR IS IT?!
They drop actually peak game trailer and expect us not to want the song in the game.
🤔 not sure if this fits brah.
Welcome back late 2000's AMVs!
I USED TO WATCH RESIDENT EVIL 4 AMVS DURING 2000S WITH THIS MUSIC MAN
7 PALABRAS: ESENCIA
Best trailer of 2025.
it's because release at night.
I read this saying to myself "Imagine if they actually used 'Bring me to Life.'" Then... 😮😮😮
hard
Did Nathan Fielder produced this trailer?
Damnnn !!!!! Reminds me of broly videos hahaha 🤣🤣🤣 I am definitely getting this game great move
nightreign doing early 2000s nostalgia
sickest trailer ive ever seen for anything ever just came out
Lmao what
Y’all cooking with the marketing 😂
"Bring Me to Life" goes with everything, even with game trailers.  EDIT: I mistyped.
This might be the cheesiest trailer ive ever seen
Peak Ring Peakreign
This trailer feels like a fever dream wtf, I did not expected that.
This song saved at least 155 lives 👏🏼
OH MY GOD ITS PEAK
Is this the early 2000s again back when you could do videos like this without copyrights going berserk?
ah yes evanescence and elden ring my favorite duo
bringing back 2000s amvs vibes
I thought this was a fan made video at first and then saw it was official and I was so happy
This song is such a throwback
THIS IS HOW YOU MARKET
absolute cinema
ok This is maybe a little to much edgyness Bandai, tome to back down a bit xd
Peak 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Absolute cinema
Bring me To Life is the Timing 🔥
Firstly, absolute fire. Also does wylder just aura farm passively?

Captain Sully sends his regards

Pffft, this feels like one of those early 2000’s “Tribute” videos.

Ok, just take my money
This is way too edgy for a souls game 🤣
CINEMA PEAK ANOTHER 10 BILLION TO MIYAZAKI

Bro, this shy looks like an amv fan made 😂
Revenant class theme song.
This is peak 2008
no way 2008 elden ring frag movie is real
I am so glad I bought this game. I hope some of my money goes to whichever genius made this trailer
My hype just went through the roof
The video title made me do a double-take lmao. Solid trailer though :)
peak
This isn't real....right?
ABSOLUTE PEAK
LOL
El diablo
Very odd music choice, though I guess maybe with the “tarnished” and these night people who eventually disappear, maybe there’s some connection?
I was already sold but now I'm *MORE* sold
Hell yeah
DMNNNNNNNNNNNN
what
I was not ready
wait, where's ssj13 goku?
We got Being me to life with Elden ring before GTA VI

We going back to our emo phases
BIS BIS BIS BIS BIS BIS
Oh... it's... it's MAJESTIC... MAJESTIC...
WHOEVER'S IDEA THIS WAS, NEEDS A RAISE
Imagine if this was a boss theme
Epic stuff!
The second I saw Bring me to life I was like no it’s can’t be, thank you for making me love this song even more
I've been living a lie. THERE'S NOTHING INSIDE!!!
They should've used the goofy version
Most random but badass trailer ever
bring me to life but not a single clip of the executor transformation ??
Hollyyyyyyyy
First devil may cry now elden ring... What year is it?!
it was unexpected
Huh
That’s kinda… Wow It’s so awesome
hell yeah
Oh my god this is the best piece of cinema I’ve ever witnessed
Early 2000/10's AMV vibes
EVANSCENCE LOL
Am I hallucinating?
Revenant will be forever ruined by Evanescence since this will be the only joke anyone ever makes XD
I clicked on this thinking it was just a choice of caption and not the actual song, wild 😂 hype honestly
PEAK
Wtf... yooo they manage to get that Evanescence music for the game..?  jeezus well done!  Btw is the music included in the Sound Track bonus?
WAKE ME UP INSIIDEE!!

Evanescence wake me up perfect choice of song 🔥😎  Wish the trailer was longer though so the whole song could play 😂
prepare to go **beyond death**..
They're really took me back to the early 2000s, I love you guys for this
Captain Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger was watching this trailer when he landed a plane on the Hudson River.
I clicked because i wasn't sure if bring me to life whats just the name of the trailer or they were actually gonna play the song and well i do not regret clicking
Bro… this could be a Fan Made AMV. But this is official!!!
7 palabras...
YO. Between The Rehearsal and this I’ve heard this song more this week than I have in decades lmao. Just makes me think of Nathan Fielder dressed as Sully Sullnberger now though…. Lmfao.
