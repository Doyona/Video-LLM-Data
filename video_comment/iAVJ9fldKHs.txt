It's obvious they've envied this woman from child hood no wonder she's died early 😭
Part 2
Your death has really caused me mommy, I was planning to come to see you and to hear that you’re no more is really frustrating 😢
Rip doctor your words are encouraging
God be with you till we meet again. Demrifa Due  Doctor oooooo
Dammmmmm i can't believe u r dead
I just can’t believe that this beautiful lady is gone for good.😢😢  I never knew her but she sounds like a great person to me.  Her death pains me so much.  May her soul rest in perfect peace
I believe God gave her to us for just a period. Jesus Christ was the world's saviour but just lived for about 33yrs and yet his impact till now can never be erased. Ppl should stop destroying her image
Rip

Awwww hmmm May her soul rest in peace
I read somewhere that she was born on 16th September.  If that is true, then then the herbalist is her job. Those with no 7 are mostly spiritualists, herbalists and traditionalists.
It very sad, my hope is if she has children who amongst all things would continue what she started. It is very sad. If I be her son or daughter I wouldn't let it lie low.
That means she was poisoned as well soon after her birthday .
I see from all the videos av seen of her that she loves to laugh paaa. Lovely Lady. May her soul rise in power to revenge her death. Those who poisoned her must pay for their actions. Selah.❤
Hmmmm.... 😢😢😢😢 rip😢😢😢
Awwwnn why so soon Dr? Emelia your beauty level is too much aba ❤
My deepest condolences to the family! May her perfect soul rest in perfect peace in Jesus mighty name amen and amen 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Awww    hmmmmmmmm
Her smile alone....oooh mummy may ur humble soul rest in peace...hmmmm
We should open our eyes on this interview. This means no hospital medicine can cure any sickness. We should open our eyes, we have been acting stupid for so long. NO HOSPITAL MEDICINE CAN HEAL!!!
