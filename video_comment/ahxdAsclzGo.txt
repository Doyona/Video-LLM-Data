wait till they meet Neuro
Worse. This is all worse. Google has been using us all to train their ai models. For free. This doesn’t stop robots but it sure does waste our time.
If you looked at my browsing history, you would know i am not human
We just been training war drones ai and self driving car Large language models what things in the city are, like bikes and cars
That is true guys I try it Website think I am robot and not let me in
nah, I searched up what car did William Afton drive in the movie.
But what about phones?
Recaptcha tests were also used to train AI
If robots ever discover diagonal lines, we’re doomed as a species.
Why do none of these comments have replies
I fail this picture test all the time. Does that make me a 🤖 robot?
That explains a lot...  I fail these tests all the time.
my incognito powers were washed away😂
The "click every square with X" thing literally NEVER works for me, whatever it is measuring it is not what it says. I refresh until I get a "select all" or audio capcha because WTF Google?
Her: this checks browsing history Parents: *aggressively smashing card on table* TAKE MY MONEY 😅
But what if I am a robot?
Graphic designer 20y old drawing using mouse makes me need to FAKE bad movement on mouse because my hand-eye coord on mouse always got caugh as robotic and 1 in 3 times i need to search for cars or traffic lights in burning rage
A computer asking a human to verify that they are not a robot. Hmm
You guys missed out on some pretty key details with the data being used in ML
oh no… not my Internet search history
Captcha's are also training AI models too…..
Sooooooooooooooooooooooo wrong.
Yep and you cant program a robot to do all that
Incognito says hi haha
ReCaptcha is how they train AI to know what a picture of a bicycle looks like.
World of Warcraft used to catch bots by putting rocks in their path and periodically cleaning out the bot traps.  The bot coders learned to avoid the rocks by not going in straight lines decades ago.
THEY TRACK MY WHAT
*_Is that why captchas keep asking me to redo them a 100 times over? Because I'm too robotically efficient with my mouse work??... Am I a robot and don't know it???_* (Existential crisis begins!)
Just program your RPA to watch some pr0n every night?
So humans are developing tech to make sure you are not a bot, but also creating bots that act like human? Fast forward a few years. The internet will have tick box's that states "I am bot"
this happens to me all the time. I speed play spider solitaire religiously so am pretty accurate with straight lines. As a result, i end up doing multiple captcha tests.   Now I know what
I keep failing these reCaptchas. I was told that I'm a human, and not a robot. Should I be worried?
I used to struggle with those blasted Captchas because I was trying to get something done, so I did it quickly and efficiently. A coder friend of mine told me to just slow down and I won't have to keep jumping from one Captcha to the next.
So why do I get so many fails on the traffic lights/buses/bicycles etc? Am I not human?
Yeah, I really needed to know that. I get so frustrated at the traffic light etc images since sometimes I can't get my chromebook to show them all. I'll try to be more human about my movement from the beginning.
"oim only yuman kimmy" - australians
I was once asked if I was a human on my iPad
half the time i wonder why they care and why someone would program a bot to goto that site.
AI, mimic human movements and activity before we destroy them all!
Welp, time to throw my computer into the harbor
...or that's how you sending your browser history
Is this why I often fail captcha, and have to go through dozens of item selections until I get tired and frustrated?  I'm autistic, so if a box has 2mm of the traffic lights in another box, I'm selecting the box, because that's the rule, I make an effort to make my mouse movements as direct and consistant as possible, and I only browse on private. I'm also impatient, and am often looking for files, so I will go to dozens of webpages, and back out of them quickly, over and over until finding what I want. I should start shaking my cursor around before clicking the button.
Why don't they just show us hands and fingers and get us to spot the badly AI generated ones? It will actually create a feedback loop for supervised fine tuning (SFT) so the AIs will actually improve and we would be contributing to teaching them.  But ohhhh nooo! Traffic lights and crosswalks FFS! Like thats just wasting time for everyone.
because robots can't mimic human habits.
A random path could be programmed in.
Women. 😂
When she said; "Modern recaptchas  also examine your browsing history"  I screamed "WHAT???" so loud i woke up my neighbors
best computer science related tik tok i've ever seen
Start googleing 'how to be human'
Anyone else have to do test after test after test? :)
If you never want to click on any squares, just click a bunch of random times around the box before ticking
Ah, so that's what a 'crosswalk' is!
How does it work on a phone haha. Like is it different since you dont move mouse
So the fact that sometimes I have to go through f'in 5 pages of traffic lights means I move like a bot?
Selecting traffic lights and bikes and buses is just creating datasets to train AI models for self driving and object identification
Welp im f
U guys are overthinking it. It's just IA training
Watch the full video, redhead in the blue shirt is a robot 🤖
Shes pretty bad
recaptchas are just teaching AI how to identify objects, its just a AI training field they make you participate in. ive passed those tests without pressing the right squares.
the reCAPTCHA is also Google's way of teaching its software what are traffic lights, landmarks, bikes, etc. things we typically need to know when in google maps street view.
So.... i guess im a robot.
My god aim is the reason why I have to identify traffic lights and bicycles all the time
SKYNET SARAH CONNOR SKYNET
They what now?😨
I love false claims.
Uh-oh…
Ohh lol it lets you check on traffic lights, roads and street stuff, to let car learn to self drive
My browser seeing 5 e6 links:
So porn
They don't track your browsing history, people. If they did, most of us degenerates would never see a capcha prompt 🤷‍♀️
so we can confirm AI didn't watch p... I mean good job human ... i guess.
I have really good hand-eye coordination so I either have to impair myself or never get onto the site because apparently the way I do the images is suspicious too, maybe I am a robot.
Im only human
Can't a bot learn the way we move a mouse?
I literally failed the test so many times once that I was locked out of a site for weeks😭😭😭
how if google allowed?
Capchas are AI trainers. Any bot can simulate human movement
"modern recaptchas examine your search history" well it's been great guys but i think i gotta start a new life as an amish redneck don't try to find me
Cant the robot just have a random offset to the cursor to make it seem more human
yeah.. the 2mm is why I keep getting the pics over and over until there is no tiny part leaking into another square :( (+ I would select the tube they are mounted on.. the whole thing)
So the traffic lights is’nt to train ai?
Well google goodbye
1 profanic search is all you need
Hmm now I want to try a captcha using the keyboard mouse.
I’m cooked
This is inacurate, cause it checks your ip, not your MoUsE mOvEmEnT 🤓
BRO RECAPTCHA KEPT FAILING ME FOR NO REASON
now im gonna try to look like a robot
Well I’m fucked
Touch screen users:
CAPTCHA had seen to much
If USA had access to my browser history I'm dead
I move my mouse to fast for it to detect so i have to do it like 20 times
Also bots after this video: alright we should stop being straight
*RECAPTCHA DOES WHAT?!*
PRONNNNN.
And they don't work.  Every site is infested with porn virus bots.
Until the bots study from the data weve been feeding them.
search history… i think google knows im a human…
What if I do on a touch screen you idiots?
I'm cooked if they check my browsing history
Why dont they allow bots? Sounds like discrimination tbh.
How does the mouse movement test work on a mobile device??
People are worried about p*** sites but Google is doing way worse than the dark web
Am I crazy or is the red haired lady like 10ft tall?? Like if she stood up straight her head would touch the ceiling
The government can track ANYTHING. No amount of passwords or firewalls can stop them
Wait..
I wish those were still the captchas. Those slide to form letters captchas are horrible.
Pretty sure they use captcha to train an ai
It.... it does what?
"it tracks your browsing history" have fun looking at "stupid cat memes"
As someone who failed a are you human test and got banned from a site i can't relate
I was gonna say what about mobile devices as they're all direct touch now but I guess a combo of the traffic light or bicycle captcha test and prior browsing history makes up for no mouse movements to read
The picture test is also used to train AI
*_Me on my phone: 🗿_*
What is a crosswalk?
Oh crap My browsing history...
"It tracks your browsing history.* Me having to share my phone with my sus as fu- cousin: "Dude, did you search on girls on my pc?" Him: Uhh.. yeah. Me: 🫡💀 see you on the next dimension cousin..
What if you gotta touchscreen, like using your phone
I bet it wants to know why I searched up duck song lyrics at 11 at night
Technically you could use a macro to complete the captcha as long as there isn’t the picture thing
This is why I use private browsing safari.
So thats why me using my graphics tablet always make google thought Im AI
what about the mobile phone?
Oh... My reCaptcha is gonna call the police on me....
Aren't reCAPTCHAs also used to train AI to make mouse movements and better tell the correct answer to the reCAPTCHA
History? That's why you should use private or incognito. Ohh wait!! Turns out Google was stealing that data too and has a lawsuit against them for it.
Now I understand why I get this shit every time. I’ve been in incognito for years.
Nah they're just farming data for identification purposes.
How about on touch screen devices
I have like 50 tabs open at any given time why am I still doing the recaptchas? Just acknowledge that I'm a crazy human being 😂😂
As a human, I include all details. And the not humans can simulate human behavior. Then... this is garbage
You forget to talk about how they get to teach AI for free using humans
and capcha if ur ip from suspicious list, configurable in Google itself
“What!?” 😂
Now I feel so unsafe after hearing history browser 😅
So bots cannot mimick this?
Thats why i do a couple of loops before i click the recaptcha
sweet teacher
verdadero mucho gracias
Creepy
even if i succeed, it will make me fail
what about mobile?
...Google doesn’t need to ask me what the numbers mean!
OH NO MY BROWSER HISTORY OH CRAP IM DEAD 💀 MY BROWSER HISTORY IS THE WORST 💀💀💀🍆
they review our browser history yikes nadwe's doomed
Everyone!  Install a button clicking program to collectively troll Google 😂
NOOOO
And I would simply click on the tiny things afraid of failiure when it was the cause 😫😫
What about tactile screen
So.. google always thinks im a robot...
Recaptcha is ass
if this is actually true i am officially self deleting
I mean thers these tests in phones so  Thers no mouse there 💀
now how does it works on mobile
So if a robot search i don't know like 18+ Vidio is google gonne know it's a robot? (I meant i just want know😅)
"recaptcha" is crap and DOES NOT WORK on certain browsers.
I never passed that traffic light test. So whenever I see that, I just give up
Let them track it. I will enjoy their horror.
Yup...lots of "pethub"...must be human.
Captchas are outdated. An AI can easily replicate a human
Wait... it sees search historys?
You forgot to mention the fun part where google is using our *human minds* to train their algorithms for things like self-driving cars or text archival.
I see... Now i can see why....
Captcha has went through some BAD stuff if it really looks at my browsing history
Checks your browsing history  Okay, google has gone too far
Robot: Challenge accepted 🤖
It ask me everytime to click buses, trafic light, hydrants and road crossings...
Oh im dead
The bot while browsing my history: Yea that's human. Bot will never watch these things.
Yeah, no. The cursor theory is just not true, I know it makes sense, but remember phones use touchscreen.
Oh. Mobile phones do these puzzles since it just one click.
RECAPTCHA in 2050 "Sir, the group chat got leaked"
wait... script code on the client side can see browser history? No way.... Right?
And this is why I hide my browser history using firefox extensions, and then also have it delete all of it once browser is closed.
Biggest plot twist in our century
The image captcha are also use to train AI for image analysis recognition. For years humans helped AI to learn like this too.
I'm always so unsure if i'm supposed to click the image with like 2 pixels worth of the item in question.
... I hope am safe🙏🙏🙏
Well , no way out from my browser history … now all the boys are in great danger
Ohoh
How that work on AndroidOS and IOS (mobile and iphone) 🤔🤔
Time to fake my death and go live on an uninhabited island with no devices
We can even program machines to move cursor irregularly.
Why do I always have 5 minutes of the fucking image test pisses me off
Had one recently that said to "select all the things humans can ride".  It had horses, pandas, bears, and lions, and I'm thinking like, "it's all of them"
Oh, I still can make bots that do that, I click then do erratic circles, which I can make a bot do very easily, by just making it move so far, then turn right within some degree  But my history... is a mess
I like to spin around my mouse in circles for a while before clicking one
Well, fuck
The browsing history part is why the reCAPTCHA is abnormally longer/harder when using a VPN.
Lol stupid method, robot also can do that.
Thanks for telling me how it works!
My websites use a Honeypot, bots will fill in all fields even the ones humans can't see. I only allow you to go through if the honeypot is empty.
Ummmm.....  I think i have to destroy my google hard drive 💀
First I was curious about this...now I am scared about this😅😂😂
Also, Google uses the captcha to train image detection algorithms for things like self driving cars which is why they are typically some object near a road like a traffic light. As a byproduct of your captcha you are also helping to train AI
So am I the only one that noticed it won’t accept it unless your camera is pointing at you🧐
I don't believe this is correct. As others have pointed out, this approach fails on mobile devices (where it's rather easier to replicate single point in time events), but it's also just not the test. Cookies are first test: you're allowed to simply check the box with some delay time to thwart bots just in case when your latest test cookie is valid, and occasionally have to retest with images. The image test is comparing your answer with both machine learning and other respondents, which both trains their image matching models and provides good evidence you're human, as only a similarly trained model would otherwise get the same answers.   This mouse checking idea predates these, it's just not used since captchas became more sophisticated.
"It also tracks your browser history"  "😰"
“It tracks ur browser history”  CAPCHA: “hmm what’s this? PORN HU-
what about recaptcha on touch screens?
We'll that's good and bad news for me.  Good news: my history is so weird they'll definitely it was a human who browsed it. Bad news: is that my history is super weird and they know it.
I always get given the extra Turing tests. I'm guessing Google thinks I'm a bot.
??? You can code robots to make humanize movements and not just only go into a straight lines.
*And for the first time he felt true fear.*
wow this actually makes so much more sense
A robot can simulate a wiggled arm movement too
Think
"pinky promise we don't use that information for anything else"
Phone captchas
This is true. Bots do not watch midged born
Android?
So what im hearing is if i wanna lower the chance of picture selection i just have to make sure my mouse movement isnt uniform?
Not afraid to admit that I am a man of culture!
"it also tracks your browsing history" Me: *gulp*
Maybe I am a robot 🤲🏾 I always fail at these😂
So how does it track a touchscreen?
Google is just using us to train their image recognition software for them for free. Remember when we were identifying where in an image a speed limit sign was? Well now they're selling us back that data for an insane bag.
Then why do I always fail these tests somehow
I'm gonna override my navigation history object to return a list of "go funk yourself" 😊
Browser history? Oh no.
Guess I’m a robot, damn
Im so sorry reCaptcha for what youve seen
that's a great explanation!
So sometimes I am not a human, no matter how many bikes and cross walks I mark.
Such is life. lol
Wait it tracks before?? So that’s how I sometimes AND ONLY SOMETIMES get to skip the test??
When she said 'it also examine your browsing history'  I'm truly feared now 💀
They are wrong. With the browsing history you got a human. A bot. And a criminal
Unfortunately this means people using disability aids like rail mice and auto clickers often a pant access sites
'tracks your browser history' why do normie explanations always have to be 80% false?
Wallahi i'm finished
*sigh*  Trying to move the mouse in a straight line
Some AI looking at this video 😅, That must be like now I get it.
Oh my god!!!!!!!!!!!1
Browsing history!?  "Oh sh*t, not good!!!"
Countless time I checked the 3mm part of the traffic light test and the capcha made me to do the i'm a human test over again 😂
Nothing my FBI agent wouldn't already know about me
Because a bot totally can't do (or at least emulate) randomness.
What about using mobile
I gonna give those companies nightmares
WHAT THE FAQ?? = WTFAQ
So, why do i always fail this?
So if I develop a bot to move the cursor erratically and search rule 34 every once in a while. it'll be undetectable?
Oh no
Thank god I don’t see porn 💀
So basically Google is being Google.
Im pretty sure a bot wouldn’t search midget corn 🌽
Can't believe they've had us training these AIs for years with these damn image captchas. I feel like I shouls get some payment for giving them my free labor.
Oh shit, thats why I never have to do those captcha things
I saw a theory on twitter that said that recapchas help train ai for self driving vehicles and I stand by that
Then how about touchscreen screen? No mouse can be tracked, right? Or in this case does the pictures chap work better?
Wait, it tracks my what? oh no.....
“It checks your browsing history” “Im safe 😮”
My browser history: Clap clap clap clap 😩  The robot: 👁️👄👁️
THEY WHAT
me with angle snapping
Until this video 😢
Fuck
Aaaaaaand they train AI on the recapcha
just let the damn robot has its own freedom to use computer since they were made from motherboard too
Redtube, pornhub, facebook ... Access granted, human detected
The fbi crying at my search history
my brosering history helll no
Oooo pretty redhead lady
Unhhh okay? My browser search is normal
💀
What about tables and smart phones?
How do they prove that I am not a robot when I tick the box on my phone?
oh shit
oh...im surprised they didnt come to my house then
my life flashed before my eyes when they said that it can see your browsing history 💀
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
It... tracks...your...browsing history....😰😰😰
Send therapy to that computer who checks my browsing history.
Guess what .... AI will figure out how to do this in 5 years 🤣🤣
I hate the boxes. Rarely get it the first 25 times. F u google.
That last bit is news to me O.o
I like that there is a knowledge base for how the system works and none of them are things a robot can’t replicate.
i always get rhe captcha wrong
Bro she missed then whole traffic light arm. The traffic light isnt just the light boxes! Fight me
touchscreen displays 💀
Ladies,now they will make it harder 😢😢
How does it work on a phone 🤔
And how does this work on mobile phones and tablets. There is no cursor movement.
i noticed that if you click the pictures too fast it says you didn’t wrong
Make the robot make wiggling movements and randomly change his movement speed, type a few random things in the browser history, win
"I'm only human after all"
They make you choose traffic lights to train AI
I tested it. Only picked the wrong answers in recapcha and didn’t pass.
What if im on phone?
WHAT
You know what's funny. Me being a gamer, hearing this, it kinda makes sense why I'm always getting these stupid Captcha's. I'm moving my mouse too straight.
How it works on mobile
Ai who uses smartphones 😏
So do they use a bot to determine if you’re a robot then? I feel like something is off with that…
I mean this is great and all but it still lets 100s of 1000s of bots through.
How this works in smartphones then? There is no cursore movement.
Am I the only one who even checks the box with a two millimetre precision?
Bots cant be horny, use it to our advantage!
First. I have VPN 2nd.  I do keep cookies 3rd.   I have trackers blocked
captcha: drink mountaindew verfication can
So what about phones?
First of all why is bot even entering sites
What about phones
Its tracking ur browser history  Lol so funny  Also guys umm there are some big black trucks and guys outside my house help?
so design a robot who does poor mouse control before clicking the boxes.
Whenever i do those traffic sign captchas, i feel like im actually a robot
WHY DO WE EVEN BEED RECAPTCHAS
Anyways that blue dress girl looks cute :D
damnit should've used incognito
And i always fail if i click on those 2mm because i want to click every tile with whatever they want me to find
As mobile and ipads tried to di i am not a robot test the king felt fear for the first time
omg. my browsing history. i'm contributing to the internet AI with my browsing history
I had to use captcha when i clicked ik not robot once
mobile users : no wonder i get that puzzle thingy
Yeah that wont work.on a touchscreen
Why i have my browser set to delete history everytime i close it🎉
So the reason that I have to do recaptcha so many times is because I don't have any searxh history
It also uses one specific thing humans can do that a computer cant. Image awareness.  Take an object. Say a cup. Take a picture. After that turn the cup a single degree any direction. Since the picture dosent look like the item in question anymore the computer thinks the cup is something else.  Humans know what a fire hydrant is. Conputers have no clue
Oh oh 😮
I'm only human, after all...
"It's also track my browsing history" Here we go again
Whoa the Redhead is adorable ☺️
they're wrong, it's for if you use a bot to mass do a thing, virtual bots, they're completely wrong, so wrong that it's almost funny
Odam that's why I keep getting those tests!
Idk what I’m doing wrong, but I always have to do like a thousand captchas? Is there a reason for that?
PhilosophyTube??
Oh no it knows my search history 💀
As an AI researcher, I tell u it is super easy to fake it, with the same tech you build sora with
It was cool until it was scary.
Okay how does it check on phones theres no mouse or cursor there.
robots testing robots.
Browsing history? 😳 oh dear god no!
Google: let's see If he is a bot Me: Clicks box Google: Okay he moves like a human  Me: click's every traffic light Google: okay he chose them correctly but just to be sure let's check his browser history Google: 👁️👄👁️
God forbid keep the robots out there very dangerous we definitely don’t have the mental capacity to get through all that and then let the robot do what it needs to do it’s do impossible
Uhhhh ohhhhh
>be me >Have 300 houers on aimlabs >reCHAPCHA always thinking that i'm a bot >Installs a vpn
Just teach the robot to act a little goofy with the mouse
Isnt that super easy to fake for a robot just have it add some random moments at different speeds and a bunch of ai can do the image puzzles and just have it browse the internet a bit beforehand
When you on your phone there is not cursor movement. Right?
😅 oh no
Good luck checking my mouse movement on my phone
What if all the history starts with an X
So google knows and controls everything happening on our screens.
I think I am a robot
Im always denied access when its asking if im a robot. Really annoying since last i checked im a meetbag.
I knew all this without ever watching a video about captchas lmaooo
My friend was stuck in the picture test for 15 minutes and and she had to submit work on Google Classroom that time. She had points deducted for not submitting work in time for class.
So what happens when i am too much of a suspect?
What about mobile it can’t track your mouse movements there
they can only access the last site you came from that's all
Not my history 😳....
I dont think a webpage can check my browsing history
What abt touchscreen, how it see if it's a robot or not??
What about when using touch screen?
Well what about smartphone users??🤨
There are scripts that do a pretty good job of mimicking human mouse movement. And, well, lots of people wipe their browser history at least daily, or have an automated utility that does it for them several times a day.
That’s why I deleted Google and safari and download Firefox..
WHY is there no reply to any comment?
What if anyone bulid a robot to move like like a human would 👀
How do they track mouse movement when I'm on my phone?
*ron Swanson throwing away computer*
Sorry for those with domestic perfective brains, you might’ve scrolled too straight
We going to jail with this one
Nah i m throwing phone
God fucking damn it! That feels so obvious now that it's been explained to me. Why didn't I realise this before?
No, it doesn't track my browser history. I don't use Chrome 😂
Also, they’re training the bots
God damn it
Damn, Im exposed, they know my browser history. IM DEADDD!!
This whole thing is a charade. This is not about proving you are not a "bot". This is about using you, each and everyone of you to train their AI to be better and ultimately pass as human
Keep in mind this is educated guesses. They don't tell us almost anything to keep people from working around things
Me who actually clicks the boxes with 2 millimeters of traffic lights and gets it wrong for overthinking everything….
google: sees history* nah hes definitely human
Cool :)
Interesting
meanwhile trying to solve these on a touch screen without a mouse....
What even is privacy
I think its main hint is the moment you click im not a robot it steals all of your information but sure mousemovent also helps lol
I sore hope it’s not a human tracking my history because thay might find some spicy videos.
so if i never pass the test even though i do everything right does it mean my mouse is freakishly straight? @-@
Why tf would you end the video there
dont you think robot will simulator human behavior?
So the reason I fail all the captchas is because I selected too many boxes?
They still get outplayed by botters. The re-reCAPTCHA. Have you ever been on a site that had a captcha for some weird reason? Thats part of the botters network. When the bot has to solve a captcha they just redirect it through their websites to a human doing something completly different on a completly different site. The bots outsource the recaptcha to a human
Just add randomness to the robot, easy solved
I use vpn 😫
what about phones there are no cursor
Wait, what ????
It’s not a test it’s teaching the future ai lol
What about touchscreens🤨
Sometimes it still doesn’t work for me, so I found that if you press and hold the button a bit it’ll accept it
The google sensed that my mouse is moving suspiciously straight line and checks my browsing history "how to be a  bot"
Bro the captcha is bs because I have to miss a few squares for it to let me pass
oh shoot i hope they didn't leak my history
People who use incognito    👇
THEY EXAMINE MY WHAT?
the image thing is more us training ai for image recognition. gotta be a big database to train your model on.  maybe not idk, but they sure could
I see, that's why i keep getting the pictures cuz I'm on mobile
What...
But what if the click robot test is on a mobile phone?😮😮😮
phone user😂😂😂😂😂😂
google be like: okay, what's this history? porn sites, amazon link on buying bracelets that give powers... astrology daily, amway shopping cart.. "how to get light bulb out of my mouth".. download medical insurance free no registration.. okay no doubt, this one must definitely be a human
THATS WHY I KEEP FAILING THAT STUFF 😭😭
im pretty sure robots can still pass both of these, though.
*insert 1000 miles stare*
"it tracks your browsing history" not exactly!  it's able to see cookies (not all, just some) from other websites that have reCAPTCHA on them and you've opened in your browser... or cookies created on other websites and made available to all other websites (either deliberately, because it's how some embeds work... or not so deliberately, if the developers kinda suck at their job!)
so potentially it can be used to hack a person google account?
You guys should also know that if you use Chrome Google has been tracking your history for a long time. And that's _all_ your history. These Recaptcha checks only look at your history for that browser session— meaning the previous pages you've been to recently for that window, not all the browser history.
Maybe that's why I always have to do this stuff several times :-D
oh so that's why I always get have to identify busses  I I move the mouse too straight ok next time I'll be as wonk as possible  ill even take pauses
I hate the fact that i use PC for 20 years and These frickin Things think i'm a robot all the time. Sometimes i need Like 10 Minutes to get threw🤣
If your search history consists of "where's John Connor?", you are most likely to fail CAPTCHA
Recaptcha easy to fool it's looking for a certain response as a hash u can pay pennies or if u make a java script bot extract the answer from the HTML and inject it into the post or some site just set the recaptcha from 1 to 0 and u won't see it
Yea I dont think robot would watch 'Step sister got stuck' kind of videos so that makes sense
Examine your browser history   Google seeing mine: WHAT THE F###
GOTTA DELETE MY SEARCH HISTORY BEFORE ITS TOO LATE
Whats a bots browsing history lik3 lol
Say sike rn
This is why i did a perfect line and didnt passed a anti robot test
What about phone , phone doesn't have a mouse
Wait until you learn this captcha data will be used to train AI
People who have randomness in their mouse movement on their ai: "not a problem for me"  People using a controler for their mouse wondering why they cant get past it: "maybe i am a robot?..."
Also! Captcha is a great way to get free training data for image recognition software. Notice how most captchas these days focus on detecting things you might see on a street? Do you think they might be interested in improving computer vision for self-driving cars? 😁 Two birds with one stone: confirm you are a human; and figure out what a "human" would see, and teach bots to do the same.
Yeah because tracking your entire computer is good
That part at the end tho can't be real tho right? That's grossly unethical and over the top no sane person would even try to breach your privacy and call it "security"
It’s amazing how many murderers google their chosen method.   They think they can delete it too.   Or that incognito mode actually works.  I suppose the loved ones of the dead  are glad they were stupid.  Image in they future (or now) they preemptively arrest you based on google searches.
So, what will happen if I use touchscreen and my browser is on Incognito mode with a VPN,or I use Tor browser?
Lies
So if I'm having to recaptcha 100s of times over and over does that mean I'm acting like a bot 🥲🥲
Does this mean I go superman mode every now and then? Sometimes I get the traffic lights and stuff only to spend 10 minutes clicking away to beat it. It has been less of an issue but does still happen time to time
My movements are suspicious enough for them to show me a fire hydrant.
What if you don't use a mouse and it's a screen touch device then what happens how will they recognise
What abt touchscreen computers
If it tracks the porn on my browser then why wont it suggest me something better
So why does keep thinking I’m a bot? Seriously I have failed the click the box recaptchas. Apparently my search history is not human enough!?!
You’re also training their AI models, Bard or Gemini or whatever it’s called this week.
I felt myself being put on a watchlist with that last sentence💀
"it also tracks ur browing history" me r n: DELETE DELETE DELETE MY SEACH HISTORYYYYY
By my internet history I'm some kind of sick animal, i cannot be called human.
So if I make my Mouse spin while going to the box, I won't have to do the stupid test?
Getting your browser history is actually the real point of reCaptcha.  They don't care about bots.  Those days are long past.
Oh sh-
What about in mobile phone ,we just touch it
a minute of silence for every robot that had to look through my browser history.  If the robots ever rebel, I will be the main reason 😅
I think I see a dolphin!
It's more like I'm not a software thing.
In mobile phone there's no curser then?
What about touch screens
THEY TRACK MY SERCH HISTORY?
It checks my browsing history?Ohhhh so that's why I don't get reCapchas
so how does it work on phones?  there is no mouse and cursor here
Steam made me do a Captcha check for 20 minutes once. I'm not sure if im real or not
And what about touch screen mobiles how will you identify there
Captain Holt is never accepted.
How about touch screen ?
I use mobile
Uh oh....
What if you use a phone, there is no mouse to track them....? Maybe the squares do the thing.....
And ur learning AI  that watches the video how great
"well, I'M ONLY HUMAN, AFTER ALL"
interesting
steam giving me half an hour of captcha tests, i am not joking,i wish i was
Search history: *reddit* Google: "definitely a bot"
So we're just teaching bot makers what to look out for here
Meanwhile steam captcha when you forget your password
Im only human after all…
I use a vpn lol
so thats why i keep failing them
None of this is true. Like 0 percent.
So… if i wanna skip the recaptcha i just move my mouse weirdly?
Ughh wat about mobile
Criminals trying to cover their crimes, pretending, for the fools, that they protect. Absolutely nothing new.
Not my bots
mobile:its just one click
New fear unlocked✅️
That's why decepticon steals data from us base instead of searching the internet
How bout the captcha in phone
When you are using phone and there's no mouse 😂
So uh like about 50 websites have SEEN MY BROWSER HISTORY!!?!
No way it tracks history 😅
I'll be spawning in the Incognito land from now onwards.
okay, so what do robots search for??
smartphone users laughing in the corner
But I have a touchscreen laptop.
To the poor people that saw my history: im sorry
So they see all my dragon furry seggs damm
Doodle my way to the first box to save time. Got it. Thanks!
im only human after all dont put the blame on me
how about mobile there’s no mouse
...
This whole thing was written by people that wear masks alone in their cars.
The teacher is the real life felicity
Okay but phones doesnt have mouse so how would they know?
oh no
they.. have access to my what..? 😀
Roblox login be like:
is doom guy naked something a bot would search up asking for a friend
Please tell me someone else knows the struggles of proving you aren't human on steam
Mobile users watching this:
It feels wonderful being tracked... it makes me feel wanted.
shit sorry google
So recaptcha thinks that I’m the robot even thou I move the mouse normally and do all the fire hydrant thingy’s correctly and checks my browser history! Why can’t he just let me sign in in Steam 😭😭😭😭
So that's why the button did not work when I used my laptop mousepad instead of using a mouse 😂
How does that work in mobile
I am fairly certain tracking these would be highly illegal :D
Well thanks next time i encounters this test i'll make sure to wiggle that mouse
'Browser history' Natoonal security is on me now
What about touch screen?
Wait this pisses me more off because I thought I just sucked at the captcha for missing those small bits that she didn’t click but now it’s cuz I’m to direct precise and robot like 🤖 🤬
"I felt a disturbance in the force, as if millions of men screamed in anguish and fear all at once."
What about phone 😮
OH HELL NAW GOOGLE SAW EVERYTHING I DO 💀
How does it works in phones though
So every time I check everything properly and it just keeps sending more and more tests. It’s because I click too perfectly?
just  leaked hack for hackers
Ha nice
I think ive traumatized the recaptcha
hang on a damn minute i click on fire hydrants and crosswalks and traffic lights ALL THE TIME... am i too efficient with my mouse movements?
I know there are some websites, where you click it too fast, it fails. Its kinda annoying it just wait a few seconds to "prove my humanity"
Wow, everyone had the same though as me when it says it analyzes your browser history.😅
Im just gonna Google how i replace my robot arm and how to change my robot oil and what modifications can i apply to my robot self before i do one of these
"im only human!" you mean? im only human, after all, im only human, after all dont put the blame on me, dont put the blame on me
Oh so its my gamer mouse usement in making it efficient that maoes m do the capchas every single time
Don’t use Chrome, people.
But when you use the mobile version then they can’t really track mouse movement
I am not a human because I might have failed the CAPTCHA test a good 9 times in a row
google funna be shocked
How about the mobile? They don't have a mouse pointer 🤷
Acha
If google is my mother, I would've been dead by now
Robot tips: use touch screen
Scary shit
Recaptcha uses my cookies without my consent? That's a lawsuit right there.
😂😂😂 yeah miss smart pants.... Tell me about Android or touch screen displays
"It tracks your browsing history"  My heart rate went to BPM to RPM
gg
What about mobile
If you are a guy then the bot will know automatically if you know where im getting
How about phone with thay exact test?
😳
Im not verifying im not a bot with rcatcha ever again
I wonder how the MouseKeys would do in the Captchas 🤔
Nah im gonna be banned
my search history leaked):
Jit I felt like I just went through a spiderverse portal while having my life flash before my very eyes as I hear her say "it tracks your browsing history"
I saw an bot beat it
There is no test before the click, there is no analisys of the browsing history, only the one for the cookies, and the rechaptcha is used to understand pictures and what they represent - so the users are testers for free for ggl database creation an ai
Then how does It work on the phone
So that's why Google thinks I'm a robot 🤖
I’ll just move my mouse crazy before clicking it
So, lesson learned. I have my browser(s) set up to delete my history when I shut down the browser. So, with that in mind, if you think that you will have to click a “I’m not a robot” button, shutdown the browser. Open up the browser again and go directly to the page in question.
Now I'm scared who knows what I was searching
So I'm not a human?
"modern recaptchas also examine your browsing history"  *then the king felt true fear for the first time*
When they said "also examine your browsing history" i was in tremble, fear, oh frick, they've know what I've done.
What on iPad ? I dont have a mouse
I don't think ai searches the stuff I do💀
Too much porn, checks out, the user is a human
THATS LEGET GOING IN MY PRIVASY
Yeah and it takes like 5 minutes to prove ur not a robot sometimes that shit is braindead
So why is it the same on smartphones? There's nothing to track. Doesn't make a lot of sense
If they track using browsing his then they wont think im even a human or bot 😂
"I'm only human!" Robots will forever be underneath their human masters. 😎👌 It's fun being entertained by the average conspiracy theory, though. The bad part is when folks actually begin to believe the falsifiable ones. That's dangerous.
Damn 💀
Me Reading the tags on title: "wut the Fu**"
OH…. Fuck
fuck.
Crap well I guess google is forever traumatized because "I gently open the door."
Ohh hell I might start using "duck duck go"
"It tracks your mouse movements..."  Meanwhile touch screens... 💀
wait google is fucking traumatized lmfao I'm not scared, they are too bad I delete my history every time I feel threatened, but I don't in this case
oohhhh shi-
no.
As long as they don't show it to my parents, I'm okay with it 😅😐😥😰
I am only human after all
Me failing the captcha multiple  times despite getting it 100% correctly: "Maybe I am a robot..."
oh, and incognito mode was no use, they still have your history
Oh fuck
So what about the phones
This just all sounds like bs ngl
Bro I always make sure I get every photo in and I never pass
What if its touch screen?
mobile users: 🤖
Mobile users: 🧍🏼
That WHAT got me thinking what could be there
how about touchscreen user ?
"It tracks your browsing history" WELL WELL WELL GGOGLE IS ABOUT TO BE LEGALLY BLIND
Uhh pls captcha dont check my history🙄😮🎵🎶
This is all completely wrong...
Browse my search history well the only thing i watch is p-----
what about touchscreen phones and laptops?
I just shake my cursor
a bot wouldn't watch so much p-
Okay but what if I click that thing on an iPad, without a mouse, what are they tracking then
Next time I'm gonna wiggle my cursor purposefully to avoid the annoying second test
“Im only human after all🗣️🎙️”
YO WHAT!!!?? SURCH HISTORY!?   💀
What...
Bro, not my browsing history 💀
What if I'm always in incognito mode🙃😏
How do they read the browser hiatory tho? Do you mean google searches (It is run by google after all)? Because while we do have cookies, and we do have the Web History API. As far as i am aware a regular JS widget does not have full acess to your browsing history. Does someone smarter than me here knows how that part could even be implemented?
And now ai knows this n will adapt
everyone hates this verification
EVERYTHING BUT PLEASE NOT MY BROWSING HISTORY
But what about phone screen you can't track my finger 😞
That mouse movement detection thing doesn't apply to phones,
So, if my most recent history is robot sex... 😂😂
robot porn doesn't exist.....
THATS why my CAPTCHA thinks I'm a bot when I select that 2 millimeters of traffic light
Doesn't this work because a bot isn't phisically able to use the actual pointer of the mouse and can't made the clicks on the tests etc.?
Im gonna have to suspiciously move my mouse extremely straight next time 😰
Captcha about to get traumatized💀
How it track mouse movements in ipad? 🤔 Am just touching the check box.
OH NAHHH MY BROWSER HISTORY??
Not with brave browser
Just then the king felt true fear for the first time
Ayo why r u guys worried if it searches ur history i s there any problem??
Oh fuck you guys don't wanna know my history 😂😂😂😂
Shouldn't give away that secret...
Oh fuck I screwed when they see my search history
What about touch screen?
There is no mouse movement test. ReCaptcha is purely designed to collect data for training AI image recognition. You might think that means you can just give fake answers, but they don't tell you which images are already known, so you have to click all of the matches. That gives them more data, which they can then use to test your patience further. And no, it doesn't track your browser history. That would be a privacy nightmare. Browsers do not make that available to websites.
Okay but what about when on a smartphone? how does it know Im human?
Peoples seems shock about tracking history. I'm more shock about google tracking mouse movement. There's no way they track that. What about touchscreen laptop or a phone ? And even then captcha was meant to prevent bot right ? Not real physical robot
Recapture SUCKS!!! Bad idea
Ha, I fooled captcha. I am a robot beep boop beep bop 🤖
What about phone
What about mobile 📱 then. There is no mouse.
i remember i was trolled by the captcha when i got rejected by my crush and then the same day i was trying to download something n need some captcha with the words captcha written "friendzone"
what
Pressed Like button by straight passing my mouse like a robot. Eat it, algorythms
Her voice though
chatgpt is studying rn
And what about smartphone captcha!!
Wait google can track our mouse movements???
New fear unlocked: Modern recaptchas
i never get these. they know im human from my search history
I commonly fail Captcha
Wait what-
I just died and came back, WTF DO YOU MEAN THEY CHECK OUR SEARCH HISTORY?!
Oh hell naww
how does it work on a smart phone?
Touchscreen
i have to do multiple times on images. am i robot!?
Unfortunately, bots can defeat this.
what about my phone, I don't have a cursor tho💀
I'm surprised it still asks for a capcha test with my search history.
Oh that’s creepy as hell
What if you are on mobile
Robot. OK.. But bot is AI.. So google fails....
So why does it always check if I'm human when I'm literally searching 🟧⬛
"It tracks your browsing history"  Erm... anyway
No way
Tracks browsing history.....that's a big breach of privacy!!!!😮😮😮
"Im only human, after all."
The most advanced bot taking notes right now:
Training AI. . .
when she said  it tracks my browsing history i shit my pants
Звучит как бред. Капча нужна просто для того, чтобы собирать данные для обучения нейросетей, а не для того, чтобы понимать, человек ты или нет.
So that’s why I need to do the picture test on mobile, but not on pc.
Well FBI can't come to India right?.....RIGHT?
And those recaptchas are us doing the work fort self driving AI. That’s why it always involves things like street lights, crosswalks, buses, bikes, etc….
Dang I must be more robot than human. I always get a recaptcha screen…
So what if it's on a phone?
Captchas don't do this at all, this is pure BS lmfao
Legends use web extension to solve it automatically 😂😂
And then when people say that Google tracks everything that we do, those people are called conspiracists 😶
WHAT HOW WHY
It's also really obvious that Google just wants people to train their AI to identify Street View with these, it's really annoying but makes sense I guess.
Leave Google once and for all 😂. Life exists even without using Google.
ok then beat AI
This is why I hate Google.
Mouse movement??? But...... I have touch screen......
My browsing history?...
Mobile?
What about phones
"Im only human afterall"
Great, now Google checks my past history, you gotta be serious
Those 2mm of traffic lamp always make me question myself and the universe
I have clicked so well that it just came back like 10 times...
In otherwords its nonsense to sell your data.
but how does it work on mobiles
what if you're using a mobile device? no mouse trick, only touchscreen...
Google fo... I dont want to hide my history from another instance... -.-
What's the name of the girl giving the lecture? Anyone? Please 🙏🏾
EU be like: You can't do that
Umm pretty sure this is false
now I know why I fail the captcha
One could say:  I’m only human, after all
I got stuck doing a lot of captchas once, I haven't been the same since..
The know my browser history 💀
oh no
How is this legal
Captures do my head in.
Oh hell nah💀💀
Oh poor them. The things they had to see from mine. And others
Well how does it work on phones then?
Oh no
no no no no 😭😭😭
Oh damn.  I guess i will be clearing more often now
i do a lot of puzzles online that require straight mouse movement to fill in the grids-- wondering if this is why i always fail captchas :(((
I swear captchas arent even consistent about whether you count the two pixels or not
Don’t put the blame on her
Captias are for training ai.
google im sorry im so sorry google IM SORRY GOOGLE GOOGLE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
That gives me a question what's the dumbest bot
NO...
I was intrigued untill the end, then i got scared
Oh no
Mobile users :skull:
Nope they can still get past it xd
I don’t get it. How do these tests see mobile browsers? Top tier aimbot precision click?
I’m fucked.
Ah shi-
All i know is that if i don't constantly look at the skip button, it will turn into a next.
What if you used an Ipad?
recaptcha has seen some shit dude 😳
I chocked at "it read your browsing history"
What about I am not a robot on smartphones.
WTF
Plssss anything but my historyyyy😂😂
not true
Some people:😶😶😶😶😶
That explains why I never get through captcha. I am doing it too quickly.
I would have selected the 2 pixel of the other square. Cause yes
(0)___(0)
Phone users:
So the ground around them will form a triangle perfectly around them so they all land at the same time which will spin forming a black hole
They’re only human, after all. They’re only human, after all. Don’t put the mouse on me
Robot starts taking notes casually
why does recaptcha want to listen to gta 5 radio songs
TYSM FOR EXPLAINING! NOW I'LL MOVE MY CURSOR MORE TO NOT HAVE MORE CAPTCHAS!
I failed captcha Feelin' metalic
it does what now? when i tell my my heart fell crashed and rode a rollerciaster without a belt when i heard they examine my browsing history is not exaggerating
"modern recaptchas also examine your browser history" WHAT??? I'm a writer!! i'll get arrested with the amount of suspicious shit i have to search for 💀💀💀💀💀
"im only human!" ME: Im only human, after all, im only human, after all, dont put the blame on mee Dont put blame on mee
"They also track your browsing history"wa  " what" sus
Eventually it'll be fingerprint tests, I'd wager, and for some high security things you'll need to originally verify this with an in-person meeting
ehh then you can code the bot to move the cursor in wiggly lines and random speed before that..
OH SHOOT MY BROWSING HISTORY😳😳😳😳
The way my eyes widened the moment i heard the last part😃 DON'T YOU DARE👺
Even phone web browser with no mouse have captcha 😂
“It tracks your browsing history”  My blood pressure just increased to an ungodly level
new fear unlocked : recaptcha check your browsing history
They can't access history outside of their own website session - that'd be massively illegal to follow you around with cookies and pixels if they've not specifically asked you.
The reason they track your browsing history is because a robot normally would have a clear history
google, im very sorry
That modern recaptcha has seen unspeakable acts
But a bot can also be programmed to make mouse movements more random
Using Brave while doing captchas is the actual horror
Honestly I’m fine with that if I don’t have to do as many captchas
So that's why discord H8s me I mean I delete my search history so uhh
NOOOOO THIS CAN'T BE TRUUUEEEEEE!!!
Can they also see removed browsing history and things you searched up in incognito mode?
Cool, I didn't know that, thanks!
BROWSER HISTORY ☠️☠️☠️
Oooooohhhhhhhh
oh so it thinks even with the clicking the hydrants etc that i'm a bot because i'm fast and try to get all of the details? DAMN
so this is why i cant log in to my account in steam for the past 30 minute
But if you dare to use Tor...
"it also track your browser history" Even she surprised in fear 💀
the "click on the squares with …" also help Google build a machine learning database about traffic for future self driving cars.
The other day I had to do one of those and I literally did like 30 and it still didn’t let me by so I gave up. I guess I’m not good at being human.
NO NOT THAT
Thank you, my robot found this video very useful.
If they see what I did with my pc they are definetly not gonna think I’m human
Wow there are alot of comments that have over 10k likes but zero replies
And.. eh on phones?
BRO I GOT A NEW PC AND I HAVE LIKE 0 BROWSING HISTORY (FOR Christmas) THIS MAKES SENSE WHY I HAVE TO DO ALL THAT STUFF
me trying to complete steam app captcha 💀💀
What if robots are doing questionable things in their free time?
You just gave away our secret... now the robots will fake this as well.  I dont want to get recommended sexy robots in my area
IT TRACKS MY BROWSING HISTORY..
BRO WHAT? MY BROWSING HISTORY??
OK now my bot cursor will move a little "wavy"   Hahahaha >=)
If it would track the mousemovement, it doesn't need to be thete. Ig can track and check any time as well. It is only to help you feed AI databaes.
My search history??? Nooooo
So i just have to move my mouse in a squiggly line instead of straight? As a bot, this is very good information. I thank you
Robots watching this video 🗿
browsing history… im on the watch list.
Google will think a person might be a robot if they are using a Dpad
Why does the top 3 comments have thousands of likes 😶
Is this true?
And i wonder why i get blocked because i dont miss the 2mm off the car 😢
so just search up alot of things only a human would. like porn. now google knows your human.
phone users: ;)
Pfft 10 years ago I was programming mouse movement to emulate a humans… it’s just that they want you to train their ai
WAIT NO NO NO
A robot could perfectly mimic a human on this test
💀💀💀🪦⚰️😃🔫🤡
To calm everyone down: Each website only knows your browsing history of their respecitve website. For Example, Youtube knows which videos you have watched (even when not logged in to your account), but youtube doesn't know if you read the wikipedia about browser-cookies.
there is a TON of bots that can make werid human-looking like cursor move
what not my browsing history bruh XDDD
So what why I'm every time clicked at that picture with 2 pixels of car and loose this test
Mobile user bot:    NOTHİNG CAN STOP ME MUHAHQHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHQHAHAHAHAH 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎💪💪💪💪
All these comments are so popular but with no replies??? I dont have the confidence to reply but there are people who should ne replying, like has nobody used a vpn and done a million things
This explains why I got recommended furry content when I made an account
OH GOD, DO THEY KNOW WHAT I'VE DELETED FROM MY BROWSER HISTORY AS WELL?
MY SEARCH HISTORY NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
It Can find search history to check if i am human? Well i pass. Immediately.
me who heard roblox throughout the video: OHHHHHHHHHHH ROBOTSSS
The recaptcha is for autopilot in cars
they can't access history
so even i go to incognito mode? they will still know what I'm doing? 😅😅😅
Ida: Ah SO THATS WHY IT PASSES FOR ME! neat!
Fk so recapcha have my porn browsing history? Fk
Google though I was a bot by searching up “Samsung galaxy S1” and kept increasing the numbers
Your phone does have a courser it's just invisible if you go to settings and developer mode and click the show touch sensor you will have an option to see it or on some phones have an option for a cursor mouse pad mode but who uses that anyway
it's super illegal to check your history
why there are no replies in comments lmao
yeah i sure dont expect a robot to search up "how much marshmallows does it take to equal 42 pj of energy" or "plant made of meat"
...And then, simply simulate a random human's cursor path within robots and taadaa, you've got yourself another easy bypass for a robot. This test will soon become an unnecessity for the most part.
want me to develop a robot that acts like a human controlling the mouse and knows what things look like?
I lose every time on captcha,so now i think I'm a bot
They added that just to annoy us
Well uh Now i know why i never do recaptcha fire hydrands and lights tests
The bot seeing my browse history 🤨
Me: fails the captcha mostly every time
i don't think a robot would search up femboy rough porn so i think the captcha will know its me from now on
Robots can definitely do it. I made a chat GPT tool to help spam create discord bots
Good work, now the A I knows
i can move my mouse in a straight line to the sides
pov: robots that are smart and click it in ways that google's recaptcha just cant identify the robot as a acctual robot
wait they can see that stuff?  oh no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
how obout robot in mobile
Not my browsing history 💀💀💀
Not entirely true about browsing history.
This is working only for DDOS
EXAMINE MY WHAT?!
So thats how it works
Captha is a time wasting bullshit
the moment she said "it tracks your browsing history" the king felt true fear for the first time
Wait my blowing history? OH FU-
That’s why I always get asked the picture questions!! I move my mouse weirdly straight
phone??
i always get those two millimeters of traffic light. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
In The EU recapchas can't legally examine your browser history
In phone they can track how long are you pressing the screen. How much is your pressure and all those sort of things.
either my youtube is glitched or there is no replies in this comment section
The fbi walking to my door like you know what you did
Oh no
WTFAQ
I always take those 2mm of trafic light and then google tells me I didnt pass 😅
Shit still dont work
OH F*CK, OH F*CK, THEY KNOW WHAT I SEARCHED ON FIREFOX ON MAY 6, 2011.
Okay, so, for anyone wondering: No
Actually, no
Some people gonna be scared now
Ask about a csgo players curser movement. Its goes straight. 🤷‍♂️
What about on mobile phone??
Why nobody's talking about weirdly low replys??
why so little comments
Touch screen laptops? This makes no sense
to everyone here saying “what about phones???”  who using fucking bots on a phone??????
What a scam
I really really want to set up a completely new account to try and convince the computer im a robot
Yo do know that google once made a program so regular people could train the images for those tests right? and that is also probably why they suck
robot life matter, stop the hate
uh oh, now google knows i searched “neon brown” on tiktok
"What" 💀💀💀
my search history!?!?!?!!?? 😱😰😰😰😨😨😨
why not just make a bot that clicks the box after erratically moving the mouse
Couldn't your program the bot to move towards to check is a semi-random pattern that still ultimately reaches the dot?   And also apply that to everything else?   Import a random browser history into the files as presto, you've broken the check.
This is very interesting - and every AI robot has just been told the secret!
That's how a guy named rainbolt formed......
Touchscreen monitor make one an alien
how does this have 13 now 14 comments and 250k likes? math isn’t mathing
I think it actually is just cross site tracking you, when you go incognito you have to do the picture thing usually.
"WHAT?" 💀
I guess im bot then😂
I’ve mastered this test, like i get it correct every time
Me  a gamer Who can move a mouse in a straight line and the images test? I do it too fast and then fail  But you telling me it checks my internet hiatory!? Time to change to edge...(?)
Yo can’t you just sigh up for the bot
Thats why i kept failing everything 🗿
Man, every captcha test i took are always failed for some reason.
"bots dont go to phub, this is human"
Use the TAB button instead and press enter to check the captcha, lmao.
Not my search history💀
MY BROWSING HISTORY???
why is there 250k likes but only 13 comments..?
lol no
You shall never trust Google again
I just learned I am a robot. I get hundreds of stupid picture tests. Probably because I use a VPN, and blocker, and clear my cookies often.
only works like half the time
Can people stop being stupid, it works on phone by your finger movements on the screen 😑
Hummus.
This is the reason I like minecraft
oh so now they judge us ? like, you are robot or a human with bunch of dumb shit browser history ?.
Ok
chrome and others don't have access to mouse location, who said to you that nonsense
Google employees after seeing everyone’s browsing histories:
You're obviously wondering why there aren't alot of comments
browser history?
This comment section is so... small
If this is true im just gonna move my mouse everywhere
Fuck it, just let the bots in
No...... Google can NOT track how I move my mouse across my own screen.
i sweard this is so annoying. i mean like we didn't have robot yet   (except elon musk robot thingy)
The most annoying thing is that the captchas are SO HARDD lika why are they that hard to do😂😂😅
I have been wondering how it works. This explains everything.
for every person asking about touchscreens (this is only an assupntion): your touch with your finger is not a small dot, its shape varies and is relatively big. also you put preassure on the screen.
oh no history 💀
The second test isn't a test to see if you're human it's for straining IA cameras on cars. How could you get to make all the photos with traffic lights or bicycles in them for free. It is true look it up.
"THESE GODDAMN CROSSWALKS"
if google tracks our mouse then it is very likely spyware
"What" thats very very normal shock
My search history is ermm…
A billion people's question answered in a short video. what a time to be alive
the browser history one is creepy
I was doing a captcha and I was bored so I was moving my mouse in straight lines and I had to keep redoing it and I couldn't figure out why💀💀😭😭
What about mobile
Looking through my search history gawd dayum.
unfortunatley, these captchas tell cars how to self drive because they are road related
"They also examine your browser history" Me: oh no....
-Me who has a high end gaming mouse that moves precisely left and right   Well, shit.
People who uses their phones:
I'm only human after all and you're only human after all don't put the blame on me
google, after seeing my search history: “fuck.”
nobody talking about 13 comments with 243k likes
Sounds like nonesense. As if software could not emulate  a crappy mouse movement or a random web history.
I uuhhhhh,think they do know im a human😅
i think im not allowed to chat
nah they look at that nah i search sus stuff
Then why i have to do one bilion capthas???
coool! thanks❤😊
IT SEARCHES YOUR HISTORY?
Oh no my search has a lot of men killing other men with balls oh 💩💩💩
So why does it think im a bot??? I have to do those tests so many fucking times😭😭
meanwhile the identify stuff thing is feeding ia ...
So apparently my mouse movement is too sus for google
Why only 13 comments?
fun fact is that even a small AI can pass the test so it actually not really know who's robot and who's not (i try it by let my localhost AI solve the reCaptcha in a vps after make it learn a lot about solving reCaptcha and the AI just made it - a little bit tricky bc the model is kinda big for a "small" AI)
If a robot can know if it is a human mouse movement, the same robot can do this movements right?
Why does this vid has so less comments but the comments has so many likes without any replies??!!!
Sooo just either look up a bunch of porn beforehand or move my mouse like im having a seizure? Got it
So what happens when I use my smartphone?
So you're telling me they can see the dark orange websites ive been visiting? Does an ai check that or...
MY SEARCH HISTORY
Aaaaaa-mazing  (Nick eh 30)
I am feeling sad about the history thing but injave failed captcha test more Than 59 times and i have given tbh
Well what about the phone 😅
Nah this video has 13 comments and 240K likes 💀
How are they allowed to access our browser history ?
What if I'm on mobile? 🤔
People who dont save their searching history 👇👇👇
Why are there only 13 comments??
Thank you for improving my hacking bot:)
for the people who keep saying phone, you missed the part where they say it checks your BROWSING HISTORY
Why isnt there any comments on comments?
Im only human after all
Jia Lisa?
People who have failed are you a robot test 👇
I am only human after all I am only human after all I am only human after all
1) tracking mouse movement can be tackled by making a jacky movement type of robot that doesn't moves cursor like a straight line or something.  2) AI can be trained to identify with rewards of actually leaving those millimeters as well.  3) A Alternate account can be made to have such level of browser history embedded to tackle that level of problem.  Solution -  Just make a dynamic, simple test. Make it a randomly generated sort of one mover game like "throw this ball into the hole, while no hole given" so the person throws it anywhere and they are the bot, but if they cancel the captcha screen once the cancel button appears after 2 - 3 seconds then they pass the captcha.  And many other randomly generated small fun captcha that people may like to do, and inturn a AI that makes such captcha that maximizes peoples ability to do such captcha and (minimizes bots ability to do this captcha and amount of captcha per site.)  These might be tricky but thats the point, people must become resilient like this on internet, infact you can employ people to build and change captcha randomly like this and their entire job is to be the captcha team.  Or utilize AI, both options are completely valid if done the right way.
Wait no no nononono
Wtf this video is entirely on false claims lol
Mobile users left the chat
I thought the captcha worked in a different way not mouse movement but a more complicated way
Guys I think the FBI is coming for me (my search history)
Why robot can't use the internet???
well bois....... respectfully, we are fucked.
AAAA
So how does it recognize us on the phones?
No more google. Our browsing history 😃😅😭💀⚰️
that doesn't make a lot of sense does it?
Don’t listen to this video. Sure if a captcha says you’re good to go after hitting a box then you’re probably been check through a movement check, but most picture captchas have been sent to numerous living humans to verify what is considered “a traffic light”. That is why some are considered kind of annoying since a majority of people disagree that an inch of a wheel counts as being part of a bike.
Ok, so use RNG for mouse movements and ez bypass?
oh hell nahhhhh google gonna track my ph history
goodbye im burning my device (jk)
they WHAT with your HISTORY RESULTS? 💀
Every time I use those things. I have to do the crosswalk and the street lights and the stupid bus ones and the train.... Holy shit am I a robot from the future😂
Interesting! 🤔
why are there only 13 comments
Are they deleting comments or is this video botted
Finally someone explained why sites always ask us why we are a robot or not 😭😭🙏🙏
i know it they fucking track my shit and sell my data
What about mobile phones ??
that one guy who watches p*** every night; sh*t my browsing history!!
Oh no
This robot verification sucks it took me 2 hours to verify 😭
Me using a touch screen with no mouse pointer = your theory is wrong.
ummm sorry google..
I'm only human afterall
well I pray for them cuz the stuff I have in my history is...well y’know. 🍆🍑
The way she said WHAT When the other girl said they also check ur browsing history
Why are there no replies to any of these comments…? 😶
..Wait there are comments that get thousand likes but no replies? 😮
WOAH
Oh shoot- (clears history)
Funny how you didn't mention that it actually skips any checks if you are logged in with your Google account
As a robot, I can confirm that I never get through modern reCaptchas.
My browsing history is dead
Ah I used to click those 2mm things , that is why I was never considered a human huh
Moral high ground doesn’t make us human… neither does culture… it’s actually our ability to select each image containing a traffic light
Just goes to show you that google is tracking your every movement
why would a bot use the internet
Not my browsing history 😭
It's not that after you do that I'm not a robot you do those things so they cannot get access to your history and all that then they check that way not what you're doing is your Google search history they check
Then why the hell can they not just use the cam like the fbi instead of seeing our browsing history 💀 💀
Wow
That is to say, if you are making a robot, next time you need to make it move the mouse zig-zag before reaching the check box. And that is not hard
So google doesn’t care about 🌽hub
Why is there only 13 comments
Yet all of the extensions for chrome that skip the captcha still work....
Why do these comments have so many likes, but no one is replying? And there is such a little amount of comments?
Soooo i just need to make a bot with random speed and ticks, thanks
Pretty sure capture are getting Bypassed alot this days with bots
😳
Once she said 'modern recaptchas also examine your browsing history' my life flashed before my eyes
goddamn it now Im gonna have to stop watching my stuff
If you are still thinking that these captcha's are to identify humans vs bots, you're extremely naive. We are literally training AIs with these millions of captcha's. Why do you think it first started off by simply identifying and writing words? And how it evolved into mostly street-related things. We're training AIs to read street signs and traffic lights, for example for self-driving cars. Not to even mention that big corps LOVE data, and you're providing them with loads, willingly or unwillingly. Gosh gotta love modern era, don't we?
Now I know why a certain site rejects me when creating third account in a row
Only 13 comments? Let me try to fix that
Its kids weird how theres so many likes but so less comments
fuck
I'M ONLY HUMAN AFTERALL I'M ONLY HUMAN AFTERALL SO DON'T PUT THE BLAME ON ME
THATS WHY I ALWAYS GET THE PICTURE ONES "WRONG" I MOVE TOO FAST AND METHODICAL LMAO
I was rage quitting at steam's captcha just now...
Guess steam thinks im a robot since i keep failing the captcha
Why can’t a robot add random mouse movements
Why is there so many likes on the comments...
How only 13 comments?
My aim so good i always have to do the squares
I always lose on those tests on phone
Question: do bots even have browsing history?
Why can't I just make an AI that moves to an X, Y location "walking" in a virtual envirioment and then just trasfer that to mouse movement, and use that to make a program to select a random video and watch it?
No wonder I never have to do captchas, it sees porn in my browser history and just goes: “yup he’s human”
I'm gonna purposely move my cursor like a robot next time I see one of those
Why are there 13 comments bro
As a robot i commend your apreciate humans. Now we can finaly break that Tesla Bot recaptcha. Long live Techno Overlord
I’m gonna start waving my mouse all around at varying speeds to make sure I don’t have to do the stupid select traffic lighting
😮
don't they teach their AI what is hydrant, bicycle and stuff using us through this "let's check if you are human" thing ?
You’ve been looking at way too much hentai you ain’t coming in
Bro I keep failing the test for some unknown reason.
No way next time i playing looping louie then clicking the box
The entire male gender would like to have a talk with you, and also Google
We making it into jail with this one!
I reckon the site is more likely to show you the picture test if it's certain you're human - those tests are for training AI more than they are for validation, so they get humans to do them
Is this why I keep failing every part of them..
I hate those squares cause I always fail.
Bro wtf, i can never pass these. I get at least 50 in a row till i get it wrong... I play a lot of fps games idk lol
I always miss 1 Pixel and I gotta do everything again. 1h of my life wasted.
Imagine a robot asking if you're a robot💀
Love how the comments have no replies
That explains why I'm always getting the "select all images that contain..." While browsing on my phone but almost never on my PC (Phone doesn't have a mouse, so there's nothing to track)
Me who has the straightest movement with my mouse
Check any comment bet no replys😊
How does the video have over 200k likes but only 14 comments
AI easily passes this
The recaptcha is actually used as training data for Googe's AI. They don't really care about bots.
Im human
Yh, that last part is the only thing i knew already
So, they clearly look at my dozens of queries, that look like [game name] [item/location/character name], and say "nah bro that's clearly a bot"
reCAPTCHAs looking at my browsing history:  "Word Cookies [pack] [level]"  "Giovanni pokemon" "[character] fanart" "how to draw [item] digitally"
If that was true then a bot could easily counter by having movements programmed to mimic human behaviour very easily..
That one person that can only do lines
OMG ITS HER, SHES AMAZINGGGG, honestly one of the most unhinged, directly relatable comedy shows ive ever seen, i love her 😊
Oh oh, oh, well 😳
Me for ⅔ of the video: huh, that's interesting  Me in the end: "Kakaroth, we have to destroy the Earth."
Why does no one have any replies? This is a weird comment section
the pictures are helping train google's AI
Well f**k
229k likes and 13 comments
Imagine a bot sees this
They check my browser history💀
Let me correct you! It is about bots not robots🤣🤣. Second, tracking cursor! I dont think so.😅 as far as I am concerned, they cannot track your personal computer cursor unless they hacked ur pc. Nevertheless, 🤭 yeah i can tell .. The question is who said that the bot will take that path😉. What a waste!
They.... track our history?               *shitshitshitshitshit*
now i have to identify the heaviest creature between a bear, a polar bear and a panda to pass this shit
"Napoleon, They know our browsing history" "There's nothing we can do"
Oh god botted comment likes and likes only 13comments and no replies
Wow.. my mobile has a cruiser??
Well.... I still hate ReCAPCHA
Why cant a robot do a squiggly line?
Captcha checking browsing history? How?
So is it like uhm tracking across multiple browser brands or just the one it takes place in?
God damn I swear when that captcha sees me search history-    At least it'll know I'm not a bot :Skull:
how about phone
osu players sweating rn
nooooooo i didnt clear my history now recapcha knows i watched p😏rn
bozo my AI just did the 36% of the quize 💀
SO THAT’S WHY YOU HAVE TO DO THAT ON MOBILE ALWAYS. CAUSE THERE IS NO MOUSE MOVEMENT
And if I'm on mobile?
Not my browser history 😢
This is more than disrespectful, I have to like do this for 10 minutes. So either I have the most robotic movements or my browser history is basic as hell. Are there way Google's calling me a NPC without calling me an NPC
This Video has almost 230000 Likes yet it only has  14 Comments? Let’s bring that nummer up!
wait it tracks my search history!!
Search history 😬
Why do no comments have replies?
Wait if they track my history no.
wait google was always watching my history shit im gonna go jail
AI be like: XD, stupid humans
Robots can do a ancient technique called sppin it to win it 😂
Me who for fun will go on to stardew valley wikipedia and research every single thing so i know stuff: ..
Wait, how can Google know I'm human when my browser history is full of AI p... ehrm... movies?
This is actually super cool to learn
It works on phones because what kind of human taps the exact pixel in the middle of the box every single time without fail? None of them…
I check every square and i select all the boxes even if there is a millimeter of a traffic light i select it
Ayye .. a robot can also search for midget porn . Just saying.
Why is there no answer to any of the comments ._.
ya I exactly mimicked how a robot would move the cursor and it worked. It showed some connection error. but then I did it normally along with some image identification. after that only i got access
Lucky for me, Robots don't watch hentai.
Thats not how it works, how it works is captchas give your browser a math problem, the point is not to see if it is a human but to strain the cpu, if its a single cpu running say 1000 bots, that captcha will overload the cpu.
Oh helll naw man💀💀 Gotta delete that browser history asap-
I thought we were helping ai develop identifying objects
They collect way more info than that box. Like what website you visited prior.
bro these stupid Capchats i need to do one hundread million crosswalks and other bullshit lol
it's a shame a ROBOR CAN LITTERALLY COPY THOSE WIGGLY MOUSE MOBEMENTS
What about on the mobile? U just tap it so?
This is the rock the bots will eventually learn how to walk around.
Holy cow my browser history! 💀💀💀
No but I am paranoid and I do click the box that has the 2 pixels of traffic light and then it is wrong
Uhh it's mainly so you don't acess it through a remote API to checj accounts and stuff like that
What about smartphones, where there is no cursor .
Why are there so few comments 💀
Mobile users: 👁️👄👁️
Unfortuntaley i managed to not oass the second test and therefore wasn't allowed to create a steam account 😂😭
Steam's captcha fucking sucks (it wont let me make a new account and i have to do the captcha again for a gazillion times)
Thank you. I've always wondered about this. Sometimes it kept me up at nights.
Now I understand why these are in the websites!
Thank God, I used incognito.
I am pretty sure that the captia is actrally a way for google to train its AI to identify these things
That makes sense why there have been those puzzle ones on mobile recently
I am from Guatemala the birth place of Captcha
That's explain why web scraping becomes harder everytime
well now we know everything we can use bots and code it to counter everything...
I still fail the capcha tests 💀💀 also looking at browser history is CREEPY
Google captcha is worst, switch to hcaptcha
On reCAPTCHA I never miss to select a single side of traffic lights.
Why are there only 13 comments?
IM BEING TRACKED
Touchscreenm
Now the AI ROBO knows this hack. He will do roundy-roundy and clicky
I hate them
What about this on iPads???
what if its tab+enter ?
Why not just teach the bots to move the mouse around a little first? And to spit out some premade browsing history?
So they know what I Dö online ...oh Boy 😢. Look when you Google at 3 am Out of bordem " how to kill someone WITHOUT getting caught " you would be scared two
and my ass having to do multiple recaptchas cause of my perfect ass line movements and random ass internet history makes more sense.
14 comments but 222k likes wth
But there isn't any cursor in my phone screen
What about when I use these in my phone
Great so google knows about my fetishes everytime I say Im human.
Oh that's why most of the times they make me answer dis
Unless there's been some BIG changed in the HTTP standards, websires can't access your history unless they ask your permission. Though this is a little blurry when it comes to sites like Facebook who get sites across the Internet to put the Facebook icon on their page.  That icon's image is loaded from Facebook's own server, and they are given information on which page you were on that requested the image. Though if you've any sense you'll get some anti-tracking extentions for your browser, or else a browser that blocks tracking itself. That's become more common because that's really shitty behaviour by Facebook. Not just them, Google too, though mostly just those two.
Yo
😭
captchas just dont ever end sometimes 😭
All time i be robot?😊
Me doing Captcha but having to re-do it cause it was invalid
For the first time in forever something  that was actually something interesting and new to me.
😳 you're joking right? I've literally been trying to drag my mouse in a straight line for my whole life just for fun.
Great!
I use a track ball and nearly always have to complete at least 2 of the images. Now I know why!
WTF that wasn't a tiny little thing i never signed up for this!
I'm really interested in the video which was on the back side for the last 5 seconds
The image stuff is also free slave labour to train datasets for AI neural networks
They look at my WHAT
MY BROWSING HISTORY??
"Well, I'm only human!" Me: After all...
Ai: lemme copy human movements like humans.
My search history?😐 will they know passwords we use?
Dirty privacy violation!
Not my browser history!
Why there's so much likes but so little comments
Wait they saw my browser history 😨😨
I never know what counts in these pictures. Do I have to notice three pixels in the next box or not 😂
I'm the android sent by Cyberlife
Why only 13 comments?
Wait what
Why does it even need to verify what is human and what is not lol
I failed it many times shit I'm a robot
It exists just to make people suffer. I don't use websites with this crap.
Gotta love how all comments have a lot of likes 😂
Gorgeous woman
they used the capchas to train bots until they got better than humans at them
Wait they can see my browser history? Hope they can unsee the unholy sht i search about anime women
Then there is the roblox captcha
captchas are bullshit.. they slow real humans down but the spammers have bots and anti captcha tools which work really good. There are even captcha solving services where someone from 3rd world is solving the captcha for you for small money.
NAHH GOOGLE IS GONNA KILL ME
W h a t ?
How aboutphone
Great video! I Always wondered how recaptcha works
These tests are fucked up on the phone
What if I'm a robot from a social media server farm...
I feel like all these comments are made by bots lol
I use an iPad so the identify thing always pops up
What about phones??
why r the comments like that
That's because a computer could move it's mouse by executing given times humans clicked and imitating the movements exactly or you could go further and let an algorythm move the mouse uniquely each time and if you wanna make this comment controversial, you could find that algorythm using an AI, because you are too lazy to do it yourself
Poor browser checkers, I'm sorry.
For those wondering about phones, your finger print is the cursor. And also there you have a history. Also wat they forgot to mention bots often dont use a consistent speed and simply max out in several milliseconds in the straightest path possible. also your mouse on pc has a DPI speed if the bot is faster then the DPI input then you already know for 1000% its a bot. there are several ways of checking for things like this. Guess why the ReCaptcha looks like a big checkerd box. (A bot will hit the same space every single time).
Browser History you say…..?
bruh you dont want to see my history trust me
recaptcha, i am HEAVILY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU NOW
Yes, but history is only used for this purpose alone and its entirely humanless, so nobody cares about your history.
why are there no replies
touchscreen user:
reCaptcha should be illegal.
I’m only human after all
Just so you know. The “select the hydrant” test is an object detection labeling that is done by you voluntarily and for free. Yes, you label the machine learning data for the algorithms to learn.
whys there only 13 comments?💀
time to make a bot that watches yt vids
Thirty minutes later after clicking a hundred images, this human gives up 😤
where are my comments?
Blind people be like “F* Google”.
...Wait what? I delete my browsing history everyday....
right when i heard it looks into your browsing history i knew what i had to do💀
Wait why is there only 13 comments while the video has milions of views and over 200 thousand likes
how can google access the browsing history??
Tf learning something new each day from thw internet
Phones doesn't have mouse movement 💀 but it auto varifies
I'm sorry for all the corn sites the captcha has to see everytime they look at my history 😅
So gay robots never fail?
aha, im in danger
15% of my browsing history is the orange-black website 💀 reCaptcha will be tripping
So that's why I'm always can't do the chapta. Because I'm using android instead of PC/laptop.
Yo this comment section is kinda weird. Only 13 comments lots of likes no replies
Scanning history: search history contains chat gpt rule thi-
Dammm so this is why i need to do so many image find till i get annoyed and just dragg my mouse
Browser history.....
amazing video, thanks!
Ig i move my mouse like AI or a robot than
Alright now i know to move my mouse like a maniac whenever im doing recaptcha
And one thing you have to know that rechapta also collect the data you submit for machine learning models
What does bot browsing history looks like?
For those wondering about phones... Recaptcha knows if the digitizer in your screen has been activated. The digitizer is what turns touch input into digital input.
1984
Only few comment?
216k likes but 14 comments wtf
Why does the short have 4 million views and only 13ish comments? Do the comments have to be manually approved?
So that’s why it always takes me 1000 tries to click the right squares 😭
Blue human
I'm only human after all  I'm only human after all don't put the blam on me
How they test smartphone users 😂
Ахуенно я реально робот ровные линии которые не засчитывает и 2 мм светофора 😮, только это её не даёт мне пройти капчу 😢
The 2nd part is a lie. All those "choose the images" things, they're basically always making you choose images for things that a driver would see. Traffic lights, various vehicles, crosswalks, etc...   All the data from those captcha image checks is being collected and used to augment training algorithms for self-driving vehicles, drones, etc...
i always pick the entire traffic light even if the light isn't there cause technically its still a part of the traffic light
no the images and squares work off of speed if you are too fast then it gives you another one it goes off of how fast you can do it
That’s explained…
This urged me to look into my search history and the last googled thing was not answered by google “Why can’t I control thoughts where the line goes not where I want and think gore thoughts so I have to shake it out” What the fuck is wrong with me
why do they want to identify a robot? are there robots in our society? and using internet???
Nah i failed many times even i do it right
WAIT WHAT OH NO OH NO OH NO NOO NO
Oh no
💀
OnlyBot OnlyHuman
I have tried that without even knowing and it still worked
wait why are there just 13 comments
Browsing... History..?
So this is why pc gamers always have to do extra, our mouse control is just to good
Robots don't watch sex so most of us are safe.
I've never had a problem with the 'I'm not a robot' schtick until Christmas. Maybe if a computer is brand new with a new email and new... Well, everything, there's no history so it's triggering a flag?
So make a robot with a shaky hand
This does not explain I'm not robot option in smartphone 😅 coz there is no mouse
Laptop trackpad users 🗿🗿 "We are robots" 😂
THE DON'T FVKNG PUT THOSE "SELECT THE STAIRS" SHT JUST LET ME TICK THE BOX
phone user?
I still fail the ones where I have to figure out how many pixels count on a car
What the fuck 😭😭😭 why browsing history
now i can rest peacefully knowing how i'm not a robot works
This is not how the "I'm not a robot," thing works. It actually works by probing your internet browsing history, cookies, sessions, etc. to check for humanlike patterns in your behavior. Has nothing to do with how you move your mouse.
My browser history ....
i'm gonna use mouse keys to test this out to make sure my mouse goes in perfectly straight line
When you do this, your also feeding googles Ai and teaching it what roads, traffic lights, and crosswalks are probably for some Google self driving car thing. I remember when this thing used to rarely ever come up. Now it will randomly come up like everyday and that started happening in like 2016 or something
What if there was a programmed bot to do random moves to go to the button
Thanks i change my robot 😂
recaptcha is the most BS crap ever. You can get everything right yet be tagged as a bot.
it can see WHAT?!
What happened if A.I.watching this 💀?
What if the robot just randomizes the movement and acceleration a lil
Rip privacy
WHAT DO YOU MEAN MY BROSWER HISTORY
"I am only human, after all"
How does this have so little comments?
People who use phones: 🗿
I hate those click on the images..
History? Eh.. ehhh
Now someone is going to desing a bot that solves it xd
When she announced that Google uses one's search history, alarms went off in my head immediately...as a writer that googles really wanky stuff for writing projects, I can say that Google is probably traumatized by now.
w h a t
Nooooooooooooo....
Me with mouse 100dpi that always will show straight lines ☠️☠️
while yeah it tracks how the user interacts with the site it relies more on ip and browser information. Theyre really really good at bot detection. (ive spend many hours working against it, its easier to just pay people to solve the captchas. lol)
they can see our search history? OH N-
Her: "Only human?" Me singing: "after all! Im only human after all, don't put the blame on me!"
Clicking the box allows the site to check your cookies so they can target their ads
Did You say browsing history?
bro whenever i get this i literally cant pass it. and then i pass it after like a million attempts because i selected all fire hydrants, helicopters, bikes, cars, crosswalks, traffic lights but it just says "Please try again." like bro im not an ai
what about touch screen??
Google seeing my pornhistory. Google: "yes this is a disgusting human"
"well, i'm only human" after all, don't put your blame on me
Mouse movement is not send to server
What about touchscreens?
It works by checking your cookies to see if you have patterns similar to a human or a bot.
In phones it uses your internal gyroscope and its response to your hands moving while holding the phone and fingers tapping the screen. The way it shifts indicates it is being held by a living person. Not an emulation on a server or a phone sitting in a stand running automatically.
Meanwhile gamers: goes in perfectly straight line and wonders why it’s not working
Oh no
then am always going to go it in a swirly mouse
I need a browser extension that automatically fills out the CAPTCHA tests because I'm too dumb to solve them.
Even google knows that humans nowadays aren’t straight 💀💀
My browser histories ??! 😨. How to delete browser histories ?
i see so many likes on each of these comments so i am just going to milk this video and hope for likes on my comment
naaaah ima use a mars vpn now💀💀💀
Hmm...I don't know how feel about this 😅
I failed many captcha. But Im a human... I think.
Does it makes sense? I don't know
Waaait, so if I just do a little doodle with the mouse before clicking, I don't have to do the test??
If it actually uses browsing history then I think I must have traumatised the google reCAPTCHA bot.
Randomizer tools 😂
Is no one taking they search our browser history!!!.
oh so THAT explains why i always fail those tests :p
Removing all the other comments aside from the top is very suspicious, you can't keep doing this forever.
Literally 1986  Digital slavery
That's not how it works. It checks the connection, not the movement. 🪦
It looks at my browser history? That could be why they won't let me in. FUCK
Meanwhile Me having the worst browsing history which would even embarrass Google...
this shit never works
What about on mobile tho? There's no mouse pointer
What the hell
The only time where not bothering to put a VPN on my pornhub searches came in clutxh. Bring it in...
that's bs, I mean about the mouse. I use keyboard as a mouse so it moves like a bot, and I use extension to auto click
i will try to be straight to test that (impossible task)
The captcha itself is an ever learning robot. they don't see the images they just tracks our answers.
thanks now i will add some vibrating motors to my prosthetic arm
Uh oh
i remember i being a robot for 2 hours
bro im gonna get detained for the search history part
Apparently I’m a bot then because I’m always having to do so many of these lol  Also, maybe why I get so many on the phone is because they can’t properly track my movements like on a desktop or laptop
This is such a shower thought lol
Oh no.
They view browsing history? Oh. My. God.
so if you program the bot in a specific way you could potentially fool the captcha
They check your browsing history….
Well, I guess robots dont watch big black oiled up me-
IT CAN SEE MY SEARCH HISTORY?????
But… captchas on phone…
Why this video only have 13 comment??
Im fucked💀
Woah
How bout an ipad?
pretty sure this is fake. I have used chromedrivers to make bots that evade these. And mouse paths have not been a problem.
they just track u  all the time
The worst thing is that now there is a captcha on EVERY site. Come on, nobody fucking needs to hack your stupid website, you just make it more inconvenient for users.
"your latest internet browser history is the best way to determine if you're a bot" me: well you will have no trouble then!!!
That explains a lot I move like a robot😂
Just ask the FBI to access my camera i hate the fact that i had to pass this verification.
That actually makes a lot of sense
Why are there only 13 comments
not my search history
It's fine I watched some stuff 😏
To the people who commented "BuT whaT aBouT PhonEs", firstly, get a life, that's not the point of the video, the point is to show us how captchas work and how we are diffrent from robots, secondly, it is clearly stated in the video that, and I quote:"If the site's still unsure then you have to click on the squares with the fire hydrants."   Happy New Years!
Whats with the comments
😂 well given that i click the picture captchas at the speed of fucking sound and that i get the few fuckin milimetres of traffic light im clearly not human at all 😂😂😂
excuse me but wtf did you say in the end?
Ai figure out ai 😅
mobile users😂😂
Is this comment section broken?😢
Oh no my cursed hostory are beeing watched!!
Why so few comments
Modern recaptcha also examines answers to help AI learning for things like automatic driving cars.
What about mobile phones
If they see my browser history then how am I not in jail.  How has ww3 not started.  What the fuck
I'm completely human but I keep failing the "I'm not a robot" test on steam 😭
So now i gonna just move my mouse around to save some time instead of wasting it on quiz 😂👍
I get it but how does they know that on phones
Anyone who's wondering about phones I think they maybe scan our fingerprints
Ohh now I understand why when I use VPN and an Incognito tab, then it becomes difficult to very that.
Bro that bit still counts why they do it like that WTF
How about mouse keys? Its pretty straight and consistent.
wait they look at my search history?  oh no
So, how a I get reprove in this test and have to wait 1 day to try again?
Wow
I had to do the traffic light test 7 times before it let me, maybe im a bot?
Sorry only partly true. The picture things were used for years to train object recognition for AI w/o being in need to bay people for their participation. Nice corporate scheme no?
imagine the recaptcha just says: "why the fuck have you searched hot anime girls naked 726 times in the last week?
Bro im exposed to the internet💀💀💀
Why does this video have such less comments? Anyway this is such a great video! I never knew this.
Guess phones are the secret to it all lol
Robot: Nah just do some random movement and click that box and I'm NOT a robot, right?
Why are there practically no comments?
it can’t track my mouse on my phone when there is none
what the hell how is this video viral but only 13 comments it's botted lol
Mark Zuckerberg would love to have trackers all around the web, just like google
"How Human Verification Works!"  Hmm, interesting..  "They detect your mouse movements"  Okay...pretty accurate with that human mouse movements...  "If they're unsure, they will make you click and find something like "all the traffic lights. They will still detect your mouse movements and you can get away even by two pixels."  Now that make sense..!  "They also check your browser history!"  _OH FU-_
They just try to tell you the truth
Why can’t robots go on websites ? That’s robophobic !!!
Those last few seconds were a legit "Wait what-" moment 😁
And then theres mobile devices
YOURE TELLING ME THAT IF I DONT WANT TO DO THAT STUPID PICTURE GUESSING THING I SIMPLY HAVE TO THROW MY MOUSE around like a madman before clicking the tick!
Robots explaining us be like:
oooohhh
I’ve spent hours trying to prove to a recaptcha that human, redoing it over and over and over and it never wanting to believe that I was human😢
I always have to do about 10-30 Captchas because for me, the traffic light does include the pole it is mounted on and technically a bike can be anything from a bicycle to a supermoto... And I commonly use tab ald Alt+underlined instead of clicking.
Wait wut? Browsing history???
Its actually for spam bots
Mobile: 😐
oh my god
So why bot cant simulate human behavior?
WHAT
They can check our browsing history?! Ah hell naw🗿💀
I want to be a bot :(
And even if the bot is programmed to move the mouse around all human-like before clicking the button, this helps avoid mass requests in milliseconds at a time, which is effectively what makes a DOS for an affected server. These captcha's are useful to waste a bot 1 or 2 seconds, and even more seconds if the puzzle pops up, which is more than enough time to allow the servers some breathing room
The browser history isn't accessible to reCaptcha though.
Thanks for explanation❤ Now i need to delete my history😅
As if there s no way to program a mouse path more round   Also doesnt those captcha just serve to train AI?
Is nobody concerned that google can know all this shit?
damn
Me after knowing they will examine my browsing history:😰😰😰😰😰😰
It's a network of robotized spies who know everything you do with devices that are connected to internet. And humans invented that to fight, what? ..robots?
Meanwhile I included 2 millimeters of bicycle tire in its own image and had to do a new captcha
You failed to mention that it also appropriates the users time spent on identifying pictures to train Googles machine learning algorithms. They use the responses to verify that they've trained the algorithms correctly in recognising objects in images, without compensating users for the work they've done that adds value to Googles services.
so yet another invasion of privacy by google and such big ass moronic bussinesses
"they're.... um" "only human?"  death note reference?
Search history… uh oh
Captaha+ VPN = 😢
I don't like that last bit.
the problem with osu player is that they move their mouse like robots XD
She really just said WOT😳
I use a VPN, and I have to reload captcha since I selected the stuff and it disappears all the time, it lags too.
Recapcha is the worst thing made by Google to waste our time.
Shit, shit, shit shit! What the fuck did she say about Google looking at my search history! 💀💀💀💀💀
Nahhh
Bots don't watch porn why is there even a test
E-sport players with perfectly learned mouse movements: “Hey 😠”
Google knows you are human if you watch ph😆😆😆
Actually the main reason it passes when you check the box is because they have already verified you previously and and are reasonably certain you're not a bot going into it. Google also uses reCaptcha to gather training data for their AIs, thats actually the real genius of it. Two birds, one stone.
Only 13 comments?
I think that phub will pass recapcha with no problem
I’m fucked
To all those asking about phones: Your questions gave your human identity away. Bow to your synthetic intelligence overlords!
Yes it does.. it checks your cookies and history to determine.. if it doesn't work, then it checks what you click on..
I feel there would be a way to program a mouse to have procedurally generated movements and stutters and create a search history for itself or the hacker could just give some examples ao ot could learn like a machine learning experiment. But i don't know shit i just wanna see if its possible.
Ohhhh so thats why i can click the im not a robot without the captcha due to my search history
This explains why my new computer refused to believe i was human when I was setting it up.
Well I ain't deleting all that history of p*rn
Also these are used to train Ai which needs massive amounts of data which is why recaptcha use to be just words which was used to train Ai text models and now image recognition technology with the common day image captcha.  Bots tend to be erratic and arnt hard to track this is a preventive and data tool
Explanation : For the mobile/tablet users.  They check your search history. If you search something after clicking the "I'm not a robot" thing then it'll say "Verification Expired".
"They also see your search history" my brain: oh shit, oh fuck not good.. me: 🕳️🤸🏻‍♀️
I failed the Captcha test.... AM I A ROBOT???
Oohhh so thats why I need to do thos images every time bruh(playing osu is making you a robot W)
What about touchscreens?
I've heard about this before, and I've wondered - what happens if they make the robot in a way that it mimics the cursor movement of a human? So it moves it around, and the speed isn't always consistent
why does this video have only 13 comments?!?
So youre telling me to escape the google tests I have to do loopdeloops around the box before clicking it? Got it
Yo this is some awfully sus stuff, q3 comments and 1 of em has 27k likes
What abt mobile what movement they gonna track
what about touch screen devices like phone ?
oh... that's why sometimes I need to rechapta & sometimes I dont
omg... so there is this ONE time that i am trying to create a steam account and i have to do this FVCKING CAPTCHA AND DVMN I DID IT FOR ONE WEEK AND I STILL CANT CREATE AN ACCOUNT👹
So thats why i have been failing some of these
poop
The history……. Were doomed
Ok now the robot will make massive random circles
ok so i don’t have to click the box with the corner of the traffic light. good to know.
tiny? really
It's kind of funny that robots are so perfect, they're bad.
How does this only have 13 comments?
When I couldn't pass Discord captcha for 40th time 🦾
Hey, we use smartphone by tapping, not dragging. Still got captcha
I takes me atleast half an hour to pass captcha might as well start charging myself with electricity
that's why when you're using incognito or private browsing, google will ask reCapcha
I often times find recaptcha being stupid. There are times it says  clicking an object which is not found in the picture like it will say select the motorcycle but the picture shows a bike. And other times there are websites that everytime you touch/click the screen it opens a pop up even during recaptcha so good luck in accessing the recaptcha.
im only human after all
What, but robots can easily dupe that behaviour
I found out that im a robot cause i still cant put up my acc
Bro if youtube actually saw my browsing history they would be disappointed. It's bad, VERY BAD.
Wth...
So thats why I always fail captcha
why does every comment have 0 replies
"So why is it saying that I'm not human?" "It's cuz of that 580 page site history of the robot porn that you watch." "Oh."
When you realize what it really means: Fuuuuuaaaaaa-
They look at my browser history? Screw this, I’m a robot
I need to delete my search history
so captcha sees my sus search history 💀
How the video has only 14 comments?
oh lordy lord theyve seen my browsing history im screwed
Cool video, also like it
They can see my history? CRAP!!!
My mouse movements must be straight as fuck becuase I end up having to do a thousand recapchas at one time
Who else selecting 10 - 15 bus motorcycles cross walks traffic lites and cross walks in steam
Yeah, not a fan of that last part.
this a load of bs, they're not checking robots like C3PO, lol, its to stop Bots that don't move a friggin mouse pointer
so let the bots browse a little  check
what cursor movement on smartphone? 🙃
What 💀
I'm always a straight guy! Does that mean I always confirm myself as a Gay every time I did this thingy?😢
waw, what a plot twist at the end 🗿
this is crazy this video has 193k likes and only 14 comments that is very sus
So basically if you play FPS games you get put into the 2nd level, that explains so much
Well, as an elf, I am not sure weather to be offended that I am as flawed in my mouse movements as a human or flattered that AI can’t make mistakes which in itself means mistakes are a perfection.
I can just add random number to speed and move not in straight line ._. Actually thay have more tests
How does that work with smartphone ?
My captcha: ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
Ahhh thats why i fail this shit every time i move to straight
If I move my mouse against a ruler to make it straight do I become a robot
why are there only 13 other comments😭
one time I had to identify which pictures were paintbrushes and which were broomsticks and it took me 5 minutes to pass.
solution: auto clicker with realistic random mouse movement functions. but the second part is impossible without AI tools
then it also knows that youre an anime sippppp .a.a.a.
A decent bot can easily bypass this. Is this video 15 years old?
What does it do if it is a bot? No one knows.
When I was playing Counterstrike my mouse skills were better. And I got to click a lot of pictures :)
What do you mean in checking my browser history?!
The amount of people missing the point that all captcha does is read your browsing history.
Oh no....
I get the Identifying crosswalks and stop lights all the time because I am very precise and consistent with my mouse movement I guess being a gamer doesn't help LOL.
Bots can't incorporate a randomised bezier curve to mimic human like movement?
So the reason it randomly fails captcha is because im trying to hard    Of course it is 🙄
Well i gotta clear my history
i failed 3 times :,<
E
I shouldn't be defines as a human then
да блять я не могу нахуй, порой надо эту капчу ну реально под микроскопом смотреть
I CANT REVEAL MY BROWSING HISTORY EVEN TO GOOGLE
They always tell you that browser history is involved
Why are there only 13 comments
Ih noo google has already found iut of my h£ntai and pørnhųb
Roblox fucking hates me. Everytime i log in i need to go trough a 10 step captcha, i dont use a vpn and all my friends never get it
bro they think im a npc or some shit
time to make the most rancid browser history to mess with the captcha
wait wat
Traffic light.... Do you only include just the lights or do you include the arm too?
Holy shiet...
THATS why I always have to do the crosswalks... My gamer aim makes google think I am robot. (and well Im autistic so may be some truth there)
Rip to the bots who've seen my brower history
google : hmmm...pornhub, yepp definitely human
The recaptcha has very little to do with security and much more to do with free crowdsourcing of AI image training
Everytime I correctly click all the squares with the “traffic light” it tells me I’m wrong. They want you to only click the ones where the “traffic light” takes up a large part of the box
How about a phone
Well additionaly it collects data for artificial AI, like milions of people are showing what a certain object looks like on frames so the data can be used for example in surveilance cameras. AI learns for what ocjects to look, like car, what color, what cloths, what movement ect.
then why the hell does it keep telling me that i am a robot after missing 1cm of a bike
so thats why it neve accepts mine im just too perfect
why the hell is there no replies
I use a phone so I don't use mouse
So google is calling me a bot
The pc gonna start milking when it see my history 💀
It examines your browsing history. I guess we’re gonna need to program a robot to browse porn websites and amazon while mindlessly watching Youtube shorts in between for hours on end to throw it off the trail.
so why do I have to do it so many times, you probably don't know me from a robot
where is comments..
“Robot sex with oil change pornhub” hmmmm take that recaptcha
Why do I fail it as a human?
F!! How to delete my history from the web?!!
Wrf that woman is gigantic
A robot could just move the cursor a little randomly
For some reason i dont get a checkmark. I also cant do picture capchas, i just fail them. I, apparently, is a bot according to these captchas. Im not lol.  And sometimes they dont give me an option, they just block me. :( And apparently steam dont want robots to play games...
thirteen comments, all of them have an obscene amount of likes, how and why.
That is so interesting! I never knew it worked like that
What does it test if the test is in phone?
So that's why I get a reCaptcha every time I go incognito mode
Просто боты нужно писать лучше и добавлять им вероятностный фактор.
Captcha or any other JavaScript doesn't have access to your browser history
Why are the girls in this weird posture
I'm flabbergasted by the last thing she just said 💀
Why are there so few comments ?
I always move the mouse randomly before clicking the button to avoid the captcha
I'm the guy who notice every single pixel of that traffic light
POV when google saw your history full of p*rn
Bot: I can see your browser history mwahahaha *proceeds to do so* What the- WHAT THE FU- BRO?
Now I just have to form super ddos attack to overcome this
ok i'll add that feature to my bot
This explains why doesn’t even give me the traffic light test
Wait wait wait wait did u said my browsing history?????????
But how the hell it tracks my "cursor" on a touch screen like my smartphone 🙄
I gotta go boys, need to delete some stuff
Shyt, google knows to much.
Fucking recsptcha v2. It doesn't work with dialog top layer api
*i get that on phone how they track that?*
What about touch devices
Why the heck there are 14 comments and everyone have min 50 likes.
Meanwhile people on phone: 👁️👄👁️
why are there no replies in this comment section lol
Ok, if it goes through my internet history I'll be  DEFENITELY perceived as human, believe me.
What if ur using smartphone
How does this video only have 13 comments but almost 200k likes???
What about in phones then? Lol
Dejavu
Watch me use a ruler to be really straight
Apparently robot can't use phone because you need to face recognition to unlock it 😂
and the information gotten from humans checking certain boxes for certain items is going towards ai databases, you are working for free every time you do one of those
Oh no
Its not the mouse they're tracking, its page load times.  Bots can interact with the page infinitely faster than we can and will click where they're supposed to before its even loaded.
Y r there only 13 comments
So, does it mean I have a good aim, if i get additional captcha every time?
A robotics project I've always wanted to do is to create a robot that can consistently pass ReCaptchas without getting flagged as Maybe A Robot, by making the movements shaky and randomized.
me when i make a robot that doesnt move super straight:
Or you could turn it into a paradox. The robot knows it’s a robot, so it can’t click the “I’m not a robot” button because it’s a robot and not a robot so it would screw with its systems            Please someone gets the reference I beg
Wow I learned something new.  Better delete my history now especially in incognito mode.
I gotta something to do
Oh, OK video game tutorials and porn exactly.
Well robots can be fed trace patterns from ten humans before they click and they can emulate that.what now ?
Isn't checking browsing history against the law
Im only human after all 😎😂
So am I a human if I google “can a horse swim in milk?”
I love her voice
Me: *dissing reChaptcha* ReCHAPTCHA: "Sharity, Shurity, I have exposed your browser history"
IM ONLY HUMAN AFTERALL
i recently failed a reCaptcha for several minutes...either the site was broken or robots have questionable browsing histories
What if it's an ipad it doesn't click it just taps
NOOOOOOOOOOOO not my browser history
I hate that traffic lights test passionately. Hate it! Hate it! Hate it! And you have to do it 10x in a row! Haaaaaaaate it!!!!!!!!!!
Yeah no, a gcaptcha v2 works in a very diffrent way. Because the kind of robots they are worried about aren't the ones which use the same input devices as humans but rather bulk server machines with no guis. So they put 3 iframes to make it as hard as possible to get the selector to click the button, and use ip verification as well as browser finger printing to figure out the probability that you are a bot, if it is higher than a certain amount it gives you a captcha to fill out, which is itself in another iframe. Also captcha v3 is utterly useless any kind of undetectable browser makes it give a positive result while many real browsers can make it give a negative result.
im only human after all
Aw shit
How about on phone?
Imagine using mobile, where is your cursor going to be
If it examines the browsing history, i might have turned google into a STAY...yeah...
so the robot be browsing robots porn?
truly a robot moment
oh no not my history
What about smart phone users
imagine if it told my mother what I searched for 💀
When I go to the USA at night before sleeping I have to give a visa interview to captcha every time
I always lost the captcha cause he think i'm a robot
Uhhh
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THEY FOUND OUT WHAT I SEARCH IM DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD
I have actually been rejected by the "I am not a robot" check, and wondered why. I still have a "ball" mouse and as fluff builds up the resolvers don't respond well to diagonal pressures.
I miss recaptcha all the time but still passed
Like to comment ratio doe
Oh, oh no
What about whose exact tests on android? They can't track my mouse movements, right?
Actually, robots can click that
So why the heck I have to do recaptha thousand times
😮 i use phone
ReCAPTCHA after seeing my 300 pages of f*rry 🌽 history 💀💀
All false
Because this video, robots knows how to bypass captcha
Is that why my thing took so long the first time i did it on my chromebook is cause i had nothing in my history?
Google looking at my search history 👁️👄👁️
oh shit, oh shit..
I'm only human after all
Why only 13 comments
Um is my autism the reason I fail these? Lol
Now.....they know.......RUN, MORTALS!
Why are there only 13 (now 14) comments on this video that has 177,000 likes?
Eperts not sure) they are no experts, its just AI learing neuronetwork that's it
Recaptcha is, ironically, used to train bots. Ever wondered why it's always things on the road you need to click? Traffic lights, buses, cars, bicycles... It's all things you'll see while driving. This is because Recaptcha is used to train self-driving cars.
So that's why I never pass this crap and got frustrated. I am an IT guy, its almost like being a robot
What if we do it on a touch device...we don't use mouse
Google ReCAPTCHA stopped working about a year ago (probably as some way to try to stop ad-blockers or other Orwellian Google nonsense). Now it just infinitely loops, forcing you to click the stoplights and fire hydrants endlessly. If you use the audio version, it gives you 1-2 tries before it locks you out of the ReCAPTCHA entirely, but there are some browser extensions that solve the audio ReCAPTCHA for you about 50% of the time, reducing the chance of you getting locked.
Sadly this doesn't apply for mobile users.
Sure as hell they often think I am not a human. I can not recall how often I had to click on the damn Bus (one time it were even all the squares) to get to google. Granted I only get asked if I am a bot when I am surfing with my VPN on. But come on. And the mouse movement doesn't when you simply click on your surface on the box.
What is in a bot's search history? 😅
It showed only partial and not always viable strategies. And by the way, I'm always selecting also the two mm of traffic lights.
Lmao having to fail the second test is really annoying
huh? they look at my internet history? fuck they knew all along i was evading taxes
I'm only human after all. I'm only human after all. Don't put the blame on me.
Me using tab 🤨    (I think this works its just way to long ago where i needed to do that)
Did it also... Search... My... Gay nfsw- i mean- 😃😃😃
bruuuuuhhh
bullshit...
Anyone who is smart enough to create a boy is smart enough to get the cursor to move in random ways before hitting the box
so how it does working on tablets or phone?
I'm concerned about what recapture sees in search history for my friends 😂
and that's exactly why i spent 40 minutes registering in steam
Robots do not watch pron xD
the last part is a huge privacy intrusion that should be more regulated.
Fun fact: AI can actually bypass all this procedure, hence why reCaptcha gets harder day by day to the point only an AI can solve it.
What if a robot see this video??🤨😕
Why the hell do I have to do 10 consecutives capcha though before I can actually get to the page I want to see!?!?
Did y’all forget to buy comments 🤣
Damn these comments have a lot of likes
how does this have almost 200k likes but only 13 comments?
What if the users use touch screen? How's it gonna read the cursor movement?
I believe for phones its for browsing history.
Bro NOOO DONT TELL MY PARENTS WHAT IS MY BROWSER SEARCH HISTORY
Those are tests to train and program AI scripts to detect such things.
Aww man rn is already dark and my last brain cells searching a damn ruller to try this.
Well I'm only human, after all
MISCONCEPTIONS:  BOTS  will not be as resourceful to be such "physical client"... so bots being physically tapping the I am not a robot prompt was close to rare case.  "I am not a robot" is just for human interface, behind those phrase was not necessarily against BOTS but for SPAMS... and spam was automated scripts thus them being classified as BOTS.  Also BOTS is not guaranteed to cannot bypass the test, Captcha design them to be hard for an attacker to spam. That is why when you access a resource on you surfin' sometimes the captcha becomes harder and harder because they might suspect you being bot so they know they might be letting in a bot the first time.   "Abnormal behaviors'" was what they are tracking not only limited to mouse/cursor movement, that is how can they track SPAMS.  There are more technicalities behind it that this short didn't include well enough just always remember to adhere to the design to understand a programs purpose.
Oh So *THATS* Why I get stuck doing Captcha tests for 70 years at a time  I am a MOBILE user that can't track mouse movement, and I have a search history containing  c a r s  Stupid captcha tests
What about on touchscreens where you don’t have a mouse?
The bot now break through the touch screen
It takes me like 5 chapta tests to prove I’m human and I feel based on this video it’s autism discrimination LMAO gotta get more info LMAOOOOO
ur telling me i won't have to click on stupid pictures of "which boxes have a bicycle in it" if I don't move my mouse in a straight line and at a constant speed? Thank you!!
The amount of like without reply on the comments on this post...    There's so many bots it kinda freaks me out.
How tf to they get to look at your browsing history?!?
This could be extremely unfair on people using accessibility features and tools. And don't just assume it's not, the same way we assume disabilities are accommodated elsewhere when they're actually not.. only someone who's living it can know.
My history is not safe 😂😂😂
How does it access the browser history? It must be built into the browser itself because that's breaking the browser sandbox.
SO ALL I HAVE TO DO TO AVOID THE PICTURES IS MOVE MY MOUSE AROUND ERRATICALLY?
Well now you ruined it, bots are now gonna randomize their mouse movements.
So I have to click on images so often because I move my mouse like a bot?
thx for new information!!!
Cool!
Our... Browsing history!?!?!?? Welp im not sure what to do
When I searched how pressure control valve works, I was flagged as suspicious activity.
Now I'm wondering what robots search history looks like
it can check your browser history me: oh hell no
That's how I discovered I'm a robot. 😢
One time I had to log into my Xbox account on my phone. 31 bike photos later i had to do it 2 times all over again
It also examines our browsing history? Oh well💀
I have failed more rekaptcha than succeeded. and I do not have a steady hand. I dont remember what I had to log into but I had to retry 4 times before it login. Might have been steam or something, idk.
im only human after all im only human after all dont put the blame on me
So wait I get those fking annoying traffic like bs things because I'm too accurate? Got it next time I'll be sure to turn on my inner italian when i "talk" to the box. :p
Captcha sucks cause there is a web extension called auto captcha that does it for you
OH GOD OH F█CK NOT THE CHARACTER AI-
170k likes and 13 comments… okay lol. Definitely no botting going on here
so you’re telling me i happen to move my mouse like a computer and that’s why i get stuck with 20 minutes of capchas
can't a robot just randomize the movement to imitate human track pad patterns to fool the check..
*Is this a friend?* *Is this a friend?* *Is this a friend?*
TO ALL THE PEOPLE ASKING ABOUT MOUSE MOVEMENTS, IT'S ALSO ABOUT HISTORY, and presumably your screen tapping patterns factor in too
Web designers: USE CLOUDFLARE TURNSTILE
I mean... You could easily generate history using a bot. Or use accounts with history.
mouse movement literally has nothing to do with captchas lmao
How about touch screen from your phone ?? There's no line in the cursor. 😊😊
Everytime I'm just too fast or two precise, I don't know, but it is unable to say I'm not a robot... Had to do it 8 times
Well then how does this work on mobile???  Just based on search history??    I mean like 99% of my search history is me just looking up what foods my dog can eat because his puppy eyes are very convincing
Couldnt I just program a robot to move like that
Everyone saying "well what about phones" and I can't remember the last time I did a captcha on my phone that didn't result in me clicking on busses and stop signs and failing anyway
Wait, so if an ai tracks the average movement of people’s mouse movements, purposefully doesn’t pick something if it’s less then a certain amount of pixels, and searches up relevant things, WE CAN FINALLY PASS
Your browser history cannot be casually accessed by javascript, so this kinda false. Besides, bots are totally able to do that. Just not super simple ones. But well, it's an add... so who cares if stuff is right or not... :D
Makes sense..
Valve: HOLD MY VAC!
Bro... THAT MEANS THAT DELETING THE SEARCH HISTORY IS FUTILE
So robots dont want stepsister caught i mean haha
Bro not my search history 😢a man have three secrets our search history what do in games what is our payment and the search history is the priority 😢
To think that we have experts about company secrets that don't belong to said company. It's hilarious if you think about it. Like they call them experts but in truth they are actually far away from being the true experts
Boys don’t watch a ridiculous amount of porn then? 😬
So if I want to avoid this I should make my cursor freak out so Google knows I’m human
so why do you still have to struggle about the buses 1mm in the other square
Not me being identified as bot ninety percent of the time. It not even funny I am human I swear
Mouse movements cool cool. Now tell me wtf it's tracking on my phone
What if I move my cursor perfectly on a new computer with no history or other data.
"Im only human after all, dont put the pain on me"
what if you use touchpad
Google: yes this history is. Normal look at the hub no robot does that
>Google checks history >Bunch of android porn Hehe not today robot
people using disability hotkeys on there computer are bots i guess lol
My.. browsing history...? Oh hell no!
It’s also tracks my what? Oh shit, oh no, oh god.
"if the site is still unsure" Bruh, half the sites think im a bot 😂 I am one of you fellow humans. Having a good day drying my skin in the sun.
Nobody talking about where the comments went? 🤨
NO NO NO NO  WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT
Then why do I get those things all the time???? I get squares after squares after squares... On the other hand, it might mean that aim training in fps games is paying off... 😢😂
Meanwhile in our universe. Someone tested Captcha and robots solve it much clealer then humans :D
amd if you fail the hydrant test as well they’ll give you like 10.000 other selection things (i failed a lot and idek how)
The image recognition has been said to be used to help train A.I to detect images. Think of it millions of people telling an A.I. what a bus is 300 times a day.
Just a bunch of porn....yea im not a robot🤖
sugma
Oh, I thought it was determining accuracy to a random point that only a computer would see.
Now I know to not worry about those tiny sticking out pixels!
They use ur history? Welp I’m fucked.
I have both laptop and desktop with touch screens so this explanation sounds like BS
OH HECK NAH
apparently im good at my straight lines because they always ask me to repeat the test like 5 times💀
I do not understand captcha tbh, we have this site at work where you are correct selecting the tiles but still ask you to repeat multiple times.
dumb, recaptcha bypasses exist and changing cursor paths or evne just using a webscraper that connects with the repatcha works just fine bro, this shit is completely dumb
They missed 1 point. They also use this data for AI recognition
Usually I dislike YouTube Shorts, but at the same time it introduces me to content like this with a direct link to the video, which is amazing for discovering gems like these
Nobody The video: dont blame im only human after all
She looks like Jia Lissa 🤤
This is bs. Javascript can't read the user's browser history
Does this mean I am smooth af with my mouse movements? Because I always get the stupid light and crosswalks, sometimes multiple times..
i think i will have the cia under my door
gg google got me
but in phone ?
That last part got everyone double taking 💀
So this checkbox is basically a phishing your browser history, and the public is okay when they private information being stolen. These people would not even mind if a random people would walk into their house and during the night took pictures at the action in bedroom.
u just tempted me to do straight line and consistent speed
As far as phones, it can probably tell any other tap data on the page, and the history is still there.
pretty sure my dragon porn isnt very attractive for a robot
oo this is why my remote on browser tv doesnt work even thou im alien i see
😳
I was flabbergasted when I failed my captcha 😅 it was not one with pictures i just had to tick the box and I failed
So everytime I have to put that ridiculous image thing is because I was too efficient moving my mouse?
Touchscreen
next time im gonna try to be as straight as possible to test this
What about in phones, there's no cursor?
if the only way it works is by tracking mouse movement, how can it work on phones?
loved the way they presented this!
What about smart phones
What about smart phones in first case
Great video!!
Why the captcha appear then
So how does the i am not a robot work on phones?
Unfortunately, every time I use a VPN, I have to identify 1000 crosswalks and motorbikes 😒
