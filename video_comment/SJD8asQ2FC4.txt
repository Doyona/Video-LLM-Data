Why Raila😂😂😂
You are ignorant reporting fake news   isn't something to get proud of
Uganda is not a republic rather than a family
Bobiwine is the problem of Uganda, he has too much fake childish propaganda 😮😮😮 he is misleading UGANDAN because of his own agenda
I don't understand whether you people do understand the meaning of independence and  whether you take enough time to varify the news you post about Africa

Dictator Museveni and your son free our sisters and brothers in your dungeons. Being in opposition is not a crime 😠
Thank you for sharing the Ugandan plight. Museveni and his son Muhozi are the pain in Ugandans asses😡
Why that man is fake like dat
For 40 years Museveni and his son and the whole family has been kidnapping and torturing Ugandans to death, silently carrying out genocide on us the oppressed Ugandans. Now they export their killings to DRC/CONGO and to South Sudan.
m7 free our country
UGANDA bleeds,  even HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION WAS COMPROMISED BY THE GOVERNMENT
But why is the west just watching all these evil deeds in Uganda by the regime?..America, Uk, and others where are you????
Who is bobie wine just causing chaos in Uganda time to time, damaging, destroying the citizens businesses, and abusive language and hence teaching bad morals to the young generation. I wish you knew how good and humble General Muhozi is and our president M7  God has really blessed Uganda with Kaguta's family for the good governance of Uganda. Long live President YKM7 for the good governance of Uganda and we Ugandans love and will always stand behind you and your family. God bless Uganda.
These fake News media houses are a problem   He's a "activist' really??
we shall overcome
May God help us 😢
Dictator Museveni is the worst thing that has ever happened to Uganda.   #DictatorM7MustGo
His Son wants to leave Uganda as his relatives left Rwanda under tribal Genocide
He scraped off age limits and presidential term limits from Ugandans Constitution by invading parliament with the Army
Thanks for standing with Ugandans,   they are really suffering under a 40 year rule rebel and his Son. Everyone is afraid to come out and say No.
Those so called Super power countries are the ones Funding Ugandans Torturing, Abduction and Killings shame upon @United Nation America and France shame upon you Instead of condemning Dictator Museven's action you are busy against Troure .
😭😭😭☝️
Lounder please
Dictator MUSEVENI must goooo

Please these guys are in drama. They have wanted M7 to go anywhere. They just playing with poor people’s minds. Where have you seen an opposition leader getting filthy rich in a country led by a dictator? They playing on the minds of the Western people/countries but on the ground we know en just wait for 2026.
Uganda is bleeding we need to be freed Museveni must go
Please Ugandans trust Bobi wine to make Uganda great nation like Ibrahim

Shame on ruto for giving besigye up

Uganda is bleeding
Muhoozi must resign and leave our country.
Thanks ❤❤ for showing this dictatorship in Uganda
You people are still talking of fair and free vote? Us Ugandans just want to be alive😭😭😭
It's a tough time
Uganda is murderous state under dictator M7 nd his cruel son
At least kizza was not brutalized.  At the point  of his capture from kenya ,he was taken straight to prison.  At the abduction of Eddie Mutwe ,he  was taken to  unknown place which we later learnt  that it was a basement owned by MUHOOZI ,M7's son where he tortured for days before being brought to court.  And to our surprise the court Judge couldn't stand his or her grounds as the law  calls not to condemn someone who was first deprived of his rights.  He /She straight away charged  him with no evidence.
Musevin and ur son muhoozi stop kindnaping ugandans leave our country enough is enough
The world must stand with Uganda 🇺🇬  and oppressed Ugandans. We're going through hell
Uganda what nonsense
You don't have news is that an international tv really
Power doesn't last for long!...May God liberate Ugandans from iron-fisted tyrants!
M7 and his regime must go, We are tired of injustices in our country 😢😢😢
😢
M7 and his son are embrassing to our country
Countries like Uganda, Cameroon, and E. Guinea baffle me.
Please keep up with the times
Wawawa enyewe RUTO MUST GO 🇰🇪✊😤🤕🇰🇪
But please do not forget that museveni came to uganda as a refugee in the 1940s as a child. Therefore muhoozi is Rwandese, which explains the deep held hatred for ugandans. No body of any nationality can be viciously hateful and spiteful to his fellow country men. The first family in uganda is Rwandese,  not ugandan.
His main target is to bring unrest in Uganda so that he declares state of emergency and postpone elections.. we're preparing for the 2026 elections and it is going to be🔥🔥 just watch the space
This guy talks too much
😂😊 like ❤😢
Museven and muhoozi must gooooo
This channel always posting about Muhoozi get something else no one is above the law forcus on other things leave Ugandan politics
Stupid pple
Uganda is bleeding 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Thank you firstpost for exposing this goon who has become a problem to the Ugandans
We are removing a dictator   Museveni,  we are not your slaves
Museveni is a foreigner in our country Uganda who came to kill and to destroy ingenious Ugandans,
Why did they show Raila Odinga while talking about Museveni at 1:32?
❤#Aman Alemyhou Dimisse Ethiopia Prime Minister wins new #❤#Firstpost tv news announce
Uganda is bleeding 😢😢😢
Let's all laugh at Ugandans 😂 Imagine having a man and his family do whatever they wish with anyone 😂
Don't jail them.  Ask for their advice.
MAY THE PRECIOUS  JESUS PROTECT EDDY MUTWE WITH HIS PRECIOUS BLOOD. GOD PROTECT BOBI WINE AND ALL HE NUP GENUINE COMRADES,
This is a dead rotten regime we are dying
The pic they showed us of Eddie without beards was photoshopped Eddie in court had the beards. Thought he was leaping to court as if he was in to much pain while in the bus he shouted with strength and even put his hand out of the bus. You who don't understand the politics of Uganda, before people you look like fools. Ugandans we are  seeing everything but what this general is doing it's like He is spying us to identify his enemies and his people. And all those who come out to speak and in the government mostly are likely to never have jobs next year and also those who spoke on Eddie mutwe were made to look fools who just speak without research. Now when this guy does anything even if it's true Ugandan will not believe it that it happened. That is Bewitchment.
U guys don't know Ugandan politics we ugandans know everything and what is going on. Do be quick to speak what you don't understand by the statement of the Chief command. That guy is not a fool.
fistpost so you should know every one asked why are you guys not showcasing Ibrahim traore and the unity of black people. if something happens bad you pick up quickly.

M7 must be arrested by all means, Enough is enough
Baby and Papa Doc
Thank you so much for loving Uganda, Continue to fight for Ugandans this is to much
Any one who takes this seriously is unserious
Are yours free and fair
But it's not enough to just talk and leave it. You have to do something
Just imagine what his going to do when he becomes president if his already behaving like that!
Muhoozi kainerugaba is a human eater 😢 he feeds on Ugandans. He abducts them, if we don't make loudest alarms they go missing forevere 😢 he must be eating our people 😱 there are many Ugandans missing 😮 totally missing for now 6 years the most famous are the 18 missing bunch of  Kibalama johnbosco, Damulira John, Lukwago Martin, kanata Muhammad and others with 2 new cases of Najib and kunta that were abducted with Eddie Mutwe
My Uganda 🇺🇬😭😭😭
We need our missing people and free all political prisoners please NRM
Museveni must go and we need our missing people 😢😢😢 free all political prisoners please m7 and your son 😢😢😢😢
At least you guys have spoken thanks for rising your voices to this impunity that is put to Ugandans by the dictator and his son we appreciate 🙏🙏
I really like the fact that you focus on Africa 🌍 great work but DNA General has nothing to add on our country. No country can be ruled by a 24/7 drunked man.
This kanerugaba is mentally ill and above all he seem to be less educated
🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬😭😭😭😭😭💯💯💯
Uganda 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💯💯💯
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💯
Achana na hako Kanairokaba sijui Kanairobaga ata kalikua kametisha kuteka Kanairo yetu hapa 🇰🇪 lakini ilibidi tu katulize boli. Kangedhubutu tungekatwanga Katoke moshi! Kachokozi sana hako.
No free and fair election ofcourse
Fake democracy.. its a dictatorial military government.. Bobi wine won the election last time but the announced different results.. why are they hiding from public.. and don't trust the people who they alleged voted for them..
Why are you showing the opposition leader of Kenya Raila Odinga as Museveni?
STUPID, in Your in S.A do have opposition military training like this is in Uganda STUPID. WHITE S.A  APARTHEID. STUPID. Do you Uganda? You are the one causing war in Africa with your fake news, working for IMPERIALISM.,  can you explain why Kiiza Besigye was arrested in Kenya, why don't you EXPLAIN to the PUBLIC, what the PUBLIC could know about his so called ABDUCTION from Kenya. These types of JOURNALISTS the biggest enemy of Africa, and are the same people used by the WESTERN and AMERICAN to TARNISH and destroy  our continent, yes Africa leaders can make mistakes but fueling it is a big mistake and it's the same mistake used by the African to destroy LIBYA and now SUDAN, AFGHANISTAN and even DRC. We should condemn it  though our leaders betray us.
Why is Yoweri doing this??
we in Uganda we are fine you can talk rubbish but we are not moved.
Ugandan opposition activist Eddie Mutwe was charged with robbery after being detained by army chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba. The incident highlights growing opposition crackdown ahead of 2026 elections, raising concerns about democracy and potential dynastic succession in Uganda.
Are you spokes person of bobi wine?
