ESPAIDAMANDA
No Venom no buy imho.😑
Other than the anime art style it looks awesome. I don't hate anime i just think it's childish, i stop watching anime at 10 years old.
0:43 people are talking about rivals i havnt even heard of this
amazing it has to be a vs another company please
Marvel, Playstation and Arc System Works, include some darker characters in future DLCs!  Marvel doesn't explore villains as much as it should, and that's a shame, so much wasted potential!
Soooo any new characters ? Its half a year guys
Add Daisy Johnson pweaseee
4V4?
DLC:"HERE COMES DAREDEVIL!"
Captain AMERICA with japanese voice lol
It has been 153 days since this trailer.  Since then, just one PS5 Only Closed Beta & no character announcements. I'm a bit shocked they haven't even been doing some drip marketing with this game up to this point.
😱😍❤🇵🇭
Rip doom voice actor
Anything but a 3d fighting arena game for marvel 😔...
Marvel minus Capcom 4
How did Sony do this it's crazy but I would've preferred PS al stars
🚬🗿
ストリートファイター6にエルフォルテとアドンとイーグルとマキを追加してほしいです。
ストリートファイター6にユンといぶきとまこととさくらを追加してほしいです。
ストリートファイター6のyear2のキャラにOutfit3とOutfit4のコスチュームを追加してほしいです。
What MVCI should've been
It’s db fighterz but marvel
Guilty Gear : Marvel Edition.  My prayers have been answered
It’s jus marvel rivals w extra steps negl to you
We need this killer on iPhone
Fix the lobby!!!!😮 What the heck is that? That was the worst part of DBZ FighterZ. Just make a regular lobby like the MVC collection or CPvsSNK2
ストリートファイター6にナッシュとアドンとディカープリとMバイソンとバルログを追加してほしいです。
I wish 2D fighting games were like 20 bucks.  They ain’t worth full triple A rated prices.
Biggest plagia i have ever seen exactly the same gameplay as 2xko
4v4 is too much I want a proper 1v1
insaneee
Looks cool but why is everyone speaking Japanese?
Whoever designed IronMan is a BIG All Might fan.
Can you please add Nightcrawler as a teleporting grappler?
I haven't touched a fighting game in YEARS. This one right here would be the one to bring me back.
Fighter Z players already knows How play this
Bring gambit back!
When switch 2
Y mi Marvel Vs Capcom?🥺
Since arcsystem worked on tokon and dragon ball fighterz, maybe a crossover will happen in the future?
cool, but definitely not the biggest fan of the overly anime art style, especially considering these are comic characters, who already have their own unique art style (hence why mvc3 added the cool cell shading effect)
We got capcom vs marvel and dc vs MK now it’s time for a marvel vs Dc game     Street fighter vs MK would also go insanely hard
0:26 whhhhaaaatttt
Beautiful as always. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Tokon and Rivals make the rest of Marvel's output look embarrassing.
Holy cow! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
ALL CAPS
this looks like fighterz and i'm down
0:08 キャプテンアメリカ 中村悠一？
Spider-Man is my main
Must buy for me
English please.
I seen Spider-Man gameplay him fighting Ghost Rider and doing this epic Dodge I need this game
So MARVEL.... but DBZ...?
2:22 no nintendo Swich 2😢
What they did right that no other fighting game does, is making couch co op 4 players!!! Looks like a great game!
What a beautiful game! It must be a delight to play! Arc System Works never disappoints!  It would be interesting to have some darker characters, like Blackheart and Knull, for example. It would be an incredible addition!  I hope to see other members of the X-Men, especially Cyclops, Magneto, and Wolverine!  Pre-order, for sure!
This looks freakin good. For sure its gonna be crazy, Next gen Marvel vs. Capcom is gonna be crazier
Already looking better than invincible vs.
Coming Soon Marvel VS Arc System Works
ARC SYSTEM WORKS IS COOKING
I hope Sentry is at least in this game, he deserves more attention.
this is amazing bro
Can’t wait
Thaaanks, this look sick!!
Since when Marvel become anime?
Every minute on this planet is 7 years on Earth.  “Ok, we’ll wait here for more Tokon characters to be announced.”
Where are the Snowbunnies
Can't wait for that game to come out
Ohhhh baby I just know arcsys couldn’t wait to get their paws on Storm.
I knew I sensed Arcsys. Yall going to hate me for saying this but this is what MVC3 should have been
Make a mobile version
Yeah!!! Japanese spider man best hero
Marvel FighterZ
Captain America and Star Lord Japanese Dub same VA as in MCU Japanese Dub; Nakamura Yuuichi [Captain America] & Yamadera Koichi [Star Lord]
Storm used to op skill about years ago. Btw nice 👍
ah it was made by the studio that made guilty gear thats cool
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Take my money!
Storm a baddie as ever 😌
greatest fighting game trailer of all time. change my mind
They're giving us Doom from day one.   They know what people like.
I just realized towards the end I could've used CC to understand what they were saying lol I'm loving this trailer! Might get this game
Expect more dlc characters than the bade roster. Its ARCs thing these days. Guilty Gear up to XX and BlazBlue were great, the rest got too much dlc.
They better have all the fantastic 4 characters so that we can actually have the whole team to play as.
Why does Doctor Doom got that Witch Craft Symbolism on his block.  He should have a Normal Block like everybody else.  And the way he's Always blocked attacks.  Something about that thing he's blocking with Doesnt Sit right for me!!!!  A lot of parents probably not gonna let their kids Buy or play tha game because of that Funky Symbolism going on.  I'd probably get rid of it to make more sales.  It looks cool but its NOT NEEDED tho.  At least give ppl the Option to Turn off Doc Doom Demonic Shield on Block.  I like his Regular Block animation.  Thank you Marvel and ARC SYS
Looks amazing and arc is one of the fighting game goats. But that name is terrible. And it sounds too close to tekken too.
If this game turns out the way we're all hoping it will, this vid will go down in history as THE HYPEST video game trailer of all time.
If there was ever a time to get a PS5 for myself it’s now
I wish we got Jagganaut and Blackheart. Arc, I beg you!
Made by the guys that made Guilty Gear? I am in.
What's up with the Japanese Marvel stuff lately?
ArcSys?? What are you doing?? Why are you looking so peak again?
Así tuvo que ser marvel vs capcom 3
After seeing how well helldivers 2 is doing on Xbox, I think they might bring this game to Xbox too.
when does it come out
Hey can you tell us if we can set the "Select" button in shortcuts in this game ?
This is like DBFZ but marvel
Marvel rivals & this looks dope... Can we get a dc version of both😂
Очень грустно то в этой игре я не вижу такой же сильной динамики какая была в ultimate marvel vs capcom 3 Мне не так принципиальна хорошая графика, мне важнее безумно быстрый и супер динамичный геймплей, так что пожалуй я так и буду играть в ultimate marvel vs capcom 3
Been WAITING for a new marvel vs type game.
Please Arc system I BEG YOU add Daredevil❤️‍🔥😈 in this game
Anime style marvel i hope they release a movie or series soon
I just got invited to the closed beta I'm so hyped
That looks way too busy.
I was fully expecting Bucky to drop outta no where and go AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN
Marvelous
Le apostaron muy bien al tipo de juego, se vienen cositas, gracias marvel
Looks really awesome. Wish it had an English dub as well as Wolverine as a playable character
Why are they speaking Japanese?
Si me hace falta capcom carnal
R.I.P to the voice of this game's Doctor Doom, Takaya Hashi. Also voiced Toki in Fist of the North Star, another Arc System Works game.  Toki, Raoh is waiting for you.
this looks clean and vibrant, i like it
Takaya Hashi (Toki, Victor Von Doom, Kakuzu) has returned to the heavens. Find someone else to voice Victor Von Doom.
Rest in peace Takaya hashi I can’t believe he’s actually gone😢
RIP Takaya Hashi the voice for Dr Doom.  1952 to 2025.
Un momento, se dieron cuenta que es muy parecido a dragón ball fighterz😮
SUPAIDAMAN DA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is the best fighting game trailer of all time
Reminds me of street fighter
I'm sorry but they shouldn't have used japanese voice lines for the game.
thought it looked pretty cool but for sure gonna buy it now since Robbie reyes ghost rider is in it
No marvel vs Capcom?, no Dante?, im not buying that thing i prefer 2xko
Finally the ps5 has one game.
カプコン開発じゃないんやろか
just wow
too much marvel content, kinda.. got tired of it
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Good bye Tekken...
This looks incredible
Naniiiii
«Waiter! It’s Marvel in my anime»
DROP THE JAPANESE VOICES PLEASE USE THE VOICE ACTORS FROM ****MARVEL MIDNIGHT SUNS*****. ESPECIALLY IRON MAN .
Que porquería!!! Como es posible que no esté Capcom!!!!! Osea es Marvel vs Marvel!!! Y ni siquiera es la misma mecánica de juego 🙄😠
Absolutely fantastic. These Japanese voice overs are peak. I only wish that DC was putting out content like Marvel is. From the movies to the video games, smh, Marvel is killing it.
Marvel vs capcom was recently re released sooo why would you buy this
Cough Capcom fighters with more profit cough cough (looks fire though)
When will Marvel do MARVEL VS DC?????
you suck for it not coming to xbox! boooo! I will never support this game now.
I'm a sucker for anything with decent mid-air combos.
MARVEL RIVALS....for REAL gamers >=]
Mehhh
I need this for xbox
ADHDmaxxing Core fighting games.   2035, 16v16 tag fighting
4v4 tag now these better than two
It seems like things are getting complicated, isn't it, Capcom? 😮
Why does everything sound 1000 times better with Japanese voice actors?? T_T
Wow, amazing!
I hope this game releases with an option to have English text + Japanese audio!
Cade a versão de switch 2 ??????
Dragon ball fighterz marvel
It's still Mahvel, baybee!
man...... i need to play this game
This looks fire
The true successor to marvel vs capcom 2
This looks wild
Sick!
Why no Xbox😢
Pleas3 bring this to Pc baby!.
NIGHTCRAWLER BLADE AND MAGIK TEAM UP I.M  WHOOPIN WHILE COOKIN
Looks terrible
its like dbz fighter z
movement star lord remind me dante marvel vs capcom 3
Amazing, so Marvel games with guilty gear animation style and fighting style too!
Day 1 purchase 4 me
So basically FighterZ style
Mahvel
I wish it want anime
Waaooo😮. Incredible
Japanese Marvel Superheroes... Without Capcom charm .
Shoulda been jojo
SPIDEYY SENSEEEE!!
take my money 💵💵💵
Please, new Mavel vs Capcom
That's the style Capcom should have gone for. mvsC dies with mvsc2
Mortal kombar
2xko???????????????????
I will buy this game. 😊😊😊
I hope this is not another button mashing game like dbfz
Amazing way to appeal to a wider audience.
Another PS4-looking PS5 game
this is a great dbz reskin
TOKON? osea es un marvel que le gusta andar tocando cosas excesivamente???
Marvel VS Capcom series, X-men VS Street Fighter, Capcom VS SNK, even Mortal Kombat VS DC Universe: we are way past time for a Marvel VS DC game. This looks great, by the way. Not knocking it. 😊
OMG DR DOOM IS  JOGO FROM JJK  1:24
1:18  STARLORD IS JOSEPH JOESTAR  JOJO REFERENCE
After years, the PS5 is finally getting good games
Esto es todo lo que debía ser MVSC en era en 3D y nunca lo fue
Why is your game not available for purchase on Steam in Kazakhstan?
4V4 civil war
This is SUPER COOL But why is Ghost Rider so slim ??
Only 2 female character 🙄🙄🙄
Goodbye Capcom ASW has a much better crew
Marvel vs. capcom 3 and up mechanics with just marvel characters… neat….
Marvel vs. Capcom without Capcom? 😱
Marverl Super Heroes vs Street Marvel
Does Star-Lord have Dante from MVC3's moveset
Is that Miyuki Sawashiro as Storm? And i like the v antenna on Aiyanman, kinda look like a gundam. Good job marvel for choosing asian studio for this game, just like rivals one. Them asian know what they are doing and know what the fans want
Marvel Mortal Kombat version with Arc System Works?! The guy who cooked Guilty Gear Strive?! Man what are u trying to cook, Marvel and Arc?! 🖐️😭🖐️
Characters wishlist for Marvel Tōkon.  Blade Magik Wolverine  Moon Knight Rogue Gambit Black Widow Black Panther  Magneto  Emma Frost The Fantastic 4 Cloak and Dagger  Luna Snow Cyclops Iron Fist Thanos The Punisher Captain Marvel Jeff the Land Shark Hela Dr. Strange Venom Thor Winter Soldier/Bucky Hulk Deadpool
NEED THE X-MEN Wolverine and Deadpool very necessary
Literally DragonBall z with marvel characterz
Fix beta link plz!!!
I feel Troy baker as ghost rider or doom
GEN-Z is NOT gona massively buy this game. (Gen z doenst play fighting games at all, they only play hero shooters,fortnite,roblox,etc) Rest in peace MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls.
Eastern devs have been absolutely on fire lately
each future hero addition is a DLC
any white female character?
We need Marvel Nemesis
It looks amazing
I just wish if this was compatible with xbox. This alone can make me buy PlayStation. But if this works with fightcade, I'm in.
Ojala traigan a sentry :D
We've seen too many games like this. Can we get a fighting game with smashbros mechanics?
No Nintendo switch 2???
Mv[Capcom]3 fumble the franchise so ArcSystem Works and Playstation Studios can piggyback the formula.
Omg so every battle is gonna start with a Civil War walk into battle scene…take my money!
I need Punisher @Marvel
this looks fire
Why does this look more like Guilty Gear than Strive? That's nuts.
These designs are so over the top that I can't help but hyped.
Really love the fervor of these lines. Japanese media has a knack for getting you hyped for stuff like this, don't know why.
"Even if despised by them, I will protect the people of this world"  That goes hard.
ive watched this trailer over and over again and i still have no idea whos even talking half the time
Is it me or do the effects look similar to DragonBall Fighter Z?
They put storm here just for J.W.
"There is only doom". Soooo cooooooool
Storm looks insane 😮
First, Rivals. Now this?  What did we do to deserve this?
next we gon have MARVEL : Battle Royal
Please make Emma Frost, Rogue, Jean Grey, Scarlet Witch and Daredevil playable characters.
maximum spider
Dr.DOOMカッコよすぎて泣きそう😢まじで嬉しい
The japanese artists have more respect for Marvel comics than Disney and Kevin Feige.
this game has tag team? like 2v2 online?
As long as this game doesn't have infinite combo mechanics...it should be a hit!!!  Mvc3 Ultimate was OVERKILL!
Add luna snow ❄️
Where is wolverine cyclops magneto
I was hoping that this was Japanese spicy man with the guns.
I'll buy it when they add Deadpool if they don't I will just keep playing marvel vs capcom 3
MY TEAM DR DOOM SPIDERMAN GOSHT RIDER :D
🔥
vão continuar com aquela porcaria de 4 botões de ação? depois que removera os 6 botões só foi desgraça.
This looks 100x better than that stupid Riot fighting fanboy game.
i absolutely love the art style.
1:55 im under the personal belief that every game with doctor doom in it after marvel vs capcom is required to give him a divekick
Finally, a game that is worth it, no nonsense and nothing more and nothing less than from the geniuses of ARC System This game is going to be crazy. I want to see your roster.
0:56 trying to tell if this is dante or deadpool
Nah bro that's so sick, I can't wait for the game!
Where is Deadpool 😡
king of fighter characters replace with marvel??
Elektra and Daredevil ok please.
Wow! This game was very cool  and i am so cruel about marvel tokon fighting souls featuring new characters like captain American, iron men,ms marvel, star lord,ghost rider,storm,spider-man and more and This game ever seen in my life.😊
Rip my controllers
おー見たところ皆揃っとるな、俺は悪魔博士だよ！
Tokon vs Tekken
Where is the rest of them? like wolverineto, cyclopseto, professor Xto, thorto
Arc Systems showing off once more ❤‍🔥
Arc is the best
I love how the game looks like DBFZ.
Not sure i like the graphics style
2XKO is sill in the oven
So marvel rivals but made into a fighting game cool
Fiiiiinnnnnaaallllllllllyyyyyyyyyyyy
My god, the dubbing is so horrible. Made it sound like cheap anime. None of of them is in character. Too much cockiness and self proud, clasic cheap anime vilain character.
MarvelFighterZ
wolvarin nowhere？
this trailer actually hurts my eyes. why does the screen slow down with every hit and why do some shots look interpolated by a computer?
Ark system works simply the best studio on earth to make fighting games Just look how Dragon Ball Z fighter (released in 2018) still has the best anime design till now (after 7 years)
Captain America Or Steve Rogers The Cap. America Aka The Steven Steve Rogers  Iron-Man Or Tony Stark Aka The Mr Stark The Anthony Tony Stark  Ms Marvel or Kamala Khan  Spider-man Or Peter Parker Aka The Mr Parker The Spidey And The Pete The SM The Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-man  Star-Lord or Peter Quill  Unmasked Star-Lord Or Peter Quill  Ghost Rider Or Johnny Blaze The JB Johnny Blaze  Doctor Doom Or Dr. Doom  Storm Or Aurora Or Ororo Munroe From X-Men 97 Storm Or Aurora Or Ororo Munroe The Black Suit From X-Men 97  Hulkbuster Mark-2
MarvelX616
Dragon Ball Fighter Z
I LOVE THIS
So marvel saved some money cut out Capcom and went marvel vs marvel universe
신난다ㅠㅠ
I can't wait 👀! After this they still need make Marvel v Capcom 5! Because MvC 4 was fail
Make Marvel American Again.
-ene! by megaman. Marvel vs capcom.
at first i thought it was Marvel vs My hero academia 🥲🥲🥲🥲
Pc and ps5 exclusive :(
Is this the Marvel vs Capcom we’ve been waiting for but without Capcom. So it’s Marvel vs Arcsystems
I can see why they decided to move on without capcom. Didn't the 2 entities have conflicts of what characters to put in? Now where marvel is doing this solo no f@!%$*& problem for them put in any characters
The future looks bland.
Arcsys truly surpassing themselves on the Fighting Game genre
This looks really fun ! I also like the fact that it looks like you can interact with some of the background too .
1:26 Not Dr doom using his glock from the comics😭🙏
I’m loving Rivals as it is but man, I grew up with fighting games so this is an automatic purchase.
Just waiting for the thing to be announced to have him say “itsa crobbering timeu”
I really dislike the voice acting... hoping they have an English voice version... I just hate all Japanese voices now... it's the same voice over and over and over.
0:04 Oh...
Cap looks awful. Why is he wearing a short sleeved jacket over his full body armor? Game looks amazing other than that though. It would be one thing if they did skins but this is just his permanent look. Like he put on the Avengers Tower Volunteer tour guide vest
Dream game
DOA
Arcsys make a dbfz vs marvel
"AVENGERS, ASSEMBURU!"
Meh they need to go back to classical characters     Enough with trying to make Kamala popular and riding off the James Gunn bandwagon
Imagine Marvel vs Capcom 4 with this graphics.
No one want see Captain US, we are tired of united states
Looks like they will be selling most of the roster as add-on characters.  Overall it looks slow compared to MvsC 3
Hopefully they show us something at evo, been feening for more news on the game
token what? Atleast its Marvel
Gambit?? Where are?
of course its Arc System works <3
If yall want a peak of what the game is gonna be like, I highly encourage you to search up guilty gear strive. It’s another fighting game made by the same studio, it’s considered one of the best fighting games currently supported
Spideeeeey sense !
I need a model kit of this gundam inspired iron man suit NOW
This game looks perfect… except for ms marvel. Waste of a character slot lol
Iron Man RX 78
Captain America just being BY THE POWER OF THE LIMITLESS SHIELD
They cooked
If only DC got this kind of love also for a fighter. Marvel are simply brilliant for this. Arcsys are almost unmatched in bringing hero and their abilities alive in a fighter
As a Marvel fan, I never  liked Capcom characters, I always dreamed of an All Marvel  Roster. So I'm  stoked.
YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYOOOOOO??
...Storm bad as hell as always, love to see it
This looks amazing, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DONT TURN OUT TO BE LIKE MVC3 or it's next  that ish was trash
It was like... the longer l watched it the better it got
game looks cool, but what a weird roster to show in the trailer
Marvel's guilty gear
This look fire yo!! 🔥
its just marvel vs capcom with marvel characters only zzz
IT’S (only) MAHVEL BABY!
I'm lookin forward to this. For sure I wanna use DOOM. Ghost Rider lookin cool too.
Riot games should fire everyone of the 2xko team after watching this trailer
Nintendo Switch 1-2
THE ART STYLE IS AMAZING!!
Лучше бы новый гилти гир выкатили
This is the 2nd time around that im really excited for figthing games.
Man, Iron Man armor looks like Voltron, it's amazing
DLC here I come
Hello im new to fighting games whats the diff between a 4v4 and game like Street Fighter??? Does it mean i have to master 4 diff characters?
Los movimientos de stard lord son bastantes parecidos a los de dante, es cómo un Marvel vs Capcom 3 solo que son 4 luchadores y más animé, y sin la presencia de Capcom
fantastic they should use this graphic engines for movies
so this is basically Marvel Vs... well Marvel
Man they just refuse to give up on Kamala Khan no matter how much everyone begs them too lol
Eh, probably another fighting game without a separate button block... it's not bad, just my personal "pain"
LOOKS AWESOME!
Marvel Anime
Let’s get some different characters for a change!
Too for mobile ?
I want to see my Rogue :<
You smell
With the X-men? yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaa
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
El mejor tráiler de un juego de peleas
Marvel Vs Capcom ma solo con personaggi marvel ò_ò
This doesn’t look nearly as cool as the one being done by Tribute.
I hope Arc Sys will be the ones to finally add in Daredevil
Can’t wait for annihilus Luna snow namor & Dracula joins in marvel tokon fighting souls!
The real question is who will be the character to have most of sol badguy moveset
Hope they load the roster up like they use to do. 40 characters atleast!
Why is nothing on Xbox  anymore
DBFZ 2 lets Gooooooo
“Spidey sensu!” I lost it.
They're gonna milk money with DLC characters for this game
No way there's a literal Marvel FighterZ being made
I'm super happy seeing how Dr. Doom is presented in this game so far. I also love how Ironman is basically a Gundam!  I'm a huge Hulk fan. I really hope when he rolls out they take inspiration from Devil Hulk (Immortal Hulk), Joe Fixit and the new Ultimate Hulk (Earth 6160) when creating him!
Some of these outfits BETTER come to Rivals!!
Add Mysterio to this game I beg you.
A marvel game that's like dragon ball fighterz!? AMAZING!!!!
OH WOW!!! OH WOOOOOOOW!!!!!!

Looks like an old school arcade game
Please release it on Switch 2 as well
Pls make street fighter fighters   in street fighter 5 style than i buy it sure
The miracle has happened and I saw it.  The day has come when the Japanese  game developers make American Superheroes better than before with looks and fighting styles.   I've been blessed thank you, God.
Why did you take so long to do something like that? I LOVE IT! I'M FREAKING OUT!
This going to go crazy in game tournaments 🔥🔥
Make it 1v1 its cleaner
How does this compares to capcom marvel fighting game
Thank you for this master piece!
I hope they add Emma Frost, but specifically, her Marvel Rivals design 😮
IT'S MARVEL BABBBBBBYYYYYYY!!!!!
Im going in my time machine right now. 2026 here i come
These stages are all homages to Marvel Vs Capcom fight stages. Marvel like FU capcom, we making a generation that doesnt know you now we don't need you!
Beste marvel kampf spiel grafik bis jetzt Grafik stimmt? Wieviele Kämpfer? Marvel vs Street fighter muss mit dieser grafik auch kommen
É obrigação este jogo sair pro Switch 2!
I want to see Maximum Spider, ultimate finish on this game!
Copy of other games Would love to see this just full 2d
Should've made it in a little bit of 3d like tekken. I hate 2ds like street fighter
marvel vs capcom without capcom
Is it 4v4 only or is there a way you can pick 1v1 2v2 3v3 or 4v4 which I think that's the way it should go
Even if there is an option to select English language, I'm still keeping it Japanese!
Please no infinites, please no infinites, please no infinites, please no infinites
Arc System Works....I am sold.
Please make Rogue playable again. It's been way too long! Gambit as well please 😁😁😁
Ive always said since guilty gear strive released, how cool would it be to have marvel characters with the art style and lo and behold here we are… 🎉❤
We need this for switch 2!
We won
Starlord seems to be like Dante from MVC3, beyond that it seems really good!
Marvel fighterZ
Thank god it's just Marvel.
Ms marvel needs a costume change. No cute bollywood outfits available. Dafuq is she wearing: a flag?
Before this game even comes out it's already a success. You can be sure of that. They just need a good roster. I really Capcom should cameo in the game
They gave quill starks cannon? Ok
It's Mahvel baby!!
THIS
I need more than 8 characters to sell me.
Where are my Wolverine and Deadpool at?
Sony can add guest character from their Playstation game. Kratos, Aloy and Jin Sakai would fit in really well. They already had Spiderman in the game by default lol
Jogo insano.
i did not even now this was a thing man i miss mvc this can maby be it
make it 4 player tag please
When's Mahvel?
Can we get an anime adaptation next? This looks awesome.
iron man? nah. iron gundam
So.....Marvel Vs Capcom is officially dead now.
Wait a second, I just realized  This is the return of Japanese Spider Man
The vibe like Civil War but with Japanese twist.
Im down for Marvel Superheroes: 4v4 Arc Sys edition
Storm with typical asian voice actor is quite something
@1:08 Esta listo para mi? Fasten your seatbelt! Que se prende la vela!
Civil war
We getting an invincible and marvel fighting game? Stand for my arrival.
DAYUM
This is looking crazy but its a shame that is not a Marvel vs Capcom game :c
Please add dormammu please add dormammu please add dormammu pleeeeeeeeeeease
Marvel comic graphics 🎉
Yesssss🥺 I wanted fighterz 2 but dis will due
The first are the most popular characters
Wild how back then marvel 4 was actually dragonball fighterZ, and now dragonball fighterZ 2 is actually marvel 5
Finally,.Mahvel
Eastern Dev's are coocking
1:52      Spider Man abuse is a pain to watch 😢
this looks too great
0:45 Gng this ain't even a fair fight 😭
Marvel Fighter Z .... looks interesting.
A Samurai Iron Man?! Squeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee~! My inner Marvel fan's goin' totes crazy for this game!
These new disney charscters they push suck .
What mvc  should been
1:25 no way we got king von in the hood
やっぱ格ゲーといえば日本よね。格闘ゲームは日本発祥
日本の会社なら、東映版スパイダーマンコスチュームが来てもおかしく無い。
Looks awesome... But There's just way too much going on in one fight.  How the hell is this even manageable?
Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls AKA Marvel Super Heroes 2
Hola, felicidades por este juego, anime, league of legends y Street fighter.
Is this available on mobile or PlayStation
Gambit!
Finally an all marvel fighting game
New fighter is coming soon! Appears it’s human torch in marvel token fighting souls,

Tomorrow 6/27 at 10:00AM (Japan time), the “ARC SYSTEM WORKS Showcase” will be broadcast on the official YouTube channel of ARC SYSTEM WORKS to introduce the latest information including the announcement of a new title. Do you think there will be new information about TOKON?  明日 6/27 10:00AM(日本時間)からアークシステムワークスの公式YouTubeチャンネルで 新作タイトルの発表を含む最新情報を紹介する「ARC SYSTEM WORKS Showcase」が配信されますね。 TOKONについての新たな情報があると思いますか？
Bro an anime, marvel, fighting game this will be peek
キャプテンが中村悠一なだけに、アイアンマンの声優が藤原さんじゃないのが悔やまれる。生きてたらきっと演じてくれてたんだろうな
Marvel Superheroes reborn.
Love the stage transitions!
I really have to give the team credit for going with their own art style rather than copying MCU designs. I'm tired of seeing the exact same Star Lord look from the movie everywhere all the time, so that design (and all the rest) are very refreshing
It gives me db fighter z vibes
It's crazy not hearing doom say foot dive
No Gambit = no buy
I have no faith in arcsys to be faithful to the source material nor to the people who are already trying to pre-order this game.
I NEEEED IT
It's (not) Mahvel baby!
So marvel FighterZ okay🤙🏽
Ghost Rider has a four-wheel vehicle??? I never knew
Characters I've seen before doing moves I've seen before. No hulk, sentinel, no venom or at the very least Carnage. I just don't see the appeal. I already own mvc3.
Wow! Looks Colossal!👀👍✅
Predicting Fantastic Four potentially before the movie
Does this mean we’re not getting anymore marvel vs capcom game? 😢 that makes me very sad
I saw this when I got into bed, now I can't sleep because I got a massive adrenaline surge. After lukewarm MvC:I, seeing the reins passed to Arksys is like standing at the gates of heaven. As a seasoned adult not much gets me pumped anymore, but ugh... now next year can't come soon enough lol.   Also, seeing as we're in the collab age, I wouldn't be surprised if Capcom licenses a few characters. I say this for one realistic reason, and a silly one. A: Capcom gave Ryu and Chun-Li to Power Rangers Battle for the Grid (with their own PW suits!) and.... B: there's a blue and yellow _umbrealla_ in one of the scenes. Soo...😏
Wait all new move sets!
Y porque xbox no eh
Bro I hate games like that with street fighter graphics like they should made it more like MK or Naruto or Dragon Ball Raging Blast
marvel fighters xD
Dragon ball fighters z
スパイダーマンの声がアニメ番の声優やん!!(嬉しすぎて語彙力が飛んだ)
Marvel, just so we're clear, we still want Marvel vs. Capcom 4 in addition to this.
Wait a minute, Are we sure this is steve Rogers Captain america? or is this jon Walkers Captain america?
Ja me vejo comprando os malditos dlc s pra ter as roupas classicas
I dont get why new stuff from western are getting to be more japanese lately like everyone is used to hearing their eng version and that japanese spider man was not good.They couldve made fighting game with eng voices.
WOAAAAW !!!!!!!!!!
Finally brought more color back to the Marvel fighting games. Looks more fun than previous games.
Marvel fighter Z
Miss Marvel 🤮🤮🤮
Hopefully this isn't PlayStation exclusive, looks so much fun 😂
05/07/2025
Marvel vs the dark past
2:21 Jeff The Land Shark appeared. "Jeff, Jury Executionerrrrrr"  *Everyone got swallow and spit out at the cliff*  OOPS! wrong game.
DBZ FIGHTER 😂😂
Is coming out for the switch 2
IS MAHVEL BAYBEE
Storm looks so beautiful
Good game
why does everything marvel makes look so good except their movies
1:33 I just noticed Matt Murdock in the window watching on.
FOOTDIVE
CINEMA!
Civil war 2 🗿🗿🗿
better see gambit in this game!
Yoooooooo this is sick and were getting a invincible fighting game too
making marvelslop games is a sign that a studio is spiritually dead (firaxis says hi btw) so RIP arcsys & thanks for the memories it was cool while it lasted
My list, Ant-Man, Daredevil, Were Wolf By Night, Elsa Bloodstone, Black Bolt, Medusa Inhumans, Inhumans Karnak, Invisible Women, BlackKnight, Polaris, Moonknight, secret boss Mad Jim Jaspers. DLC Madcap or Slap Stick, and for Halloween DLC if possible Jack o Lantern, Dracula, Mephisto, Blade, SleepWalker
The devs knew exactly what they were cooking both with character design and gameplay
Looks too slow. Otherwise its the first decent looking Marvel thing in 10+ years.
I don't care if this is not "VS  Capcom" if there's no Moriggan ain't playing bro  (; n ; )
Basically Marvel vs Capcom 4
Hearing the Japanese voice overs makes me so happy. ❤
We went 2v2 to 4v4 to 5v5. As someone who loves DC Comics vs. Sega im very excited for this
OMG MIYUKI SAWASHIRO AS STORM IS GODLIKE!!
SPIDEEEEEY SENSE 🗣️
Lawd have mercy! star lord shoots like Dante
supaidaman
looks like baby's first fighting game :/  going to be an even dumber slower dbz
They only issue I have with this is it isn't ss fsst paced as MVC2
I need cyclops to go hard in this game
I'm already maining spidey
Captain America being in the Main Cover instead of Iron Man... 🙄
This is the game i have been waiting for
They made this game look like dbfz fr
So is this only on PlayStation?
Is this game free?
Close enough. Welcome back, dragonball fighterz!
its a game, thats for sure!!!
Mejor marvel vs Capcom 4
Calling it now, Star Lord is going to be an absolute MENACE!
The only thing I’m hoping is that it’s gonna be on Xbox and there’s a English option
Team Iron Man
Reminds of Capcom vs Marvel games.... The nostalgia... ❤❤
I need that song in Youtube Music. What's the name???!
how can i survive 2025 man
So ps went marvel vs and Xbox went invincible vs 😭
Dr doom looks LIT!!
Now make this for switch2
Why is no one else mad that they excluded Capcom? Really, an entire cast of beloved video game characters excluded from the next big fighting game of all time
I need 30 characters at launch 🙏🏾
OH MY GOD.
Marvel vs. Capcom, minus the Capcom
What about marvel vs snk????
Game looks insane
I need a supaidaman reference in spideys specials
It'd be so sick to get Tatsuki Fujimoto's design of Captain America as a skin here
Lo que me encanta es el simbolismo que le dan a lo que fue Civil Wars y no hablo de la movie sino del manga, y lo representativos que son El Cap y Ironman desde esa historia, y me sigue agradando que Doom siga siendo de los villanos preferidos de Marvel para representar ese bando.
Marvel: FighterZ
My team gonna be: Iron man Spiderman Thor Blackpanther  And Hulk probably a grappler.
Where as Thanos
Close enough. Welcome back, Marvel Super Heroes!
Shouting spidey sense and dropkicking is insane
Never thought that American can speak Japanese so fluently.
This is literally what MVC infinite should've been. But hey!!!! These are the guys that are behind Guilty Gear and DBZ and Blazblue!!
why is through the fire and flames guy lying lol
That spider-man design is definitely going to be voiced by yuri
So what universe number designation shall we give this?
I was in disbelief when I heard about this upcoming game and Arcsys was making it thinking “There’s no way that could happen, right?”. Nope, this is real.
I can't remember the last time I saw an early trailer for a game that's primarily gameplay & isn't full of blatantly manipulative edits. Looks fun. Only chance I'm getting it is if it comes to Steam though. I'll never use the Epic store.
KEEP LUNA SNOW FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR AWAY
Yesss
I'd like to see: Wolverine Black Panther Thor Thanos Red Lion Namor Human Torch (Johnny Storm) Gamora  Akuma (SF series guest character)
They really said Marvel no Capcom 😂😂😂😂
This looks beautiful and fun as hell... It just ain't the same without Capcom characters though...
still can't believe this game exists. thank you everyone involved.
put some jojo va in your game and you get hits ahah
I can't wait for cosmic invasion! 😄
No Switch 2?! 😢😢
Needs a nintendo port
ArcSys making a Marvel fighting game was not on my bingo list but I welcome it with open arms and my credit card information.
storm has always been a snack right?
Bruh this gonna give marval rivals run for its money
OK this CA is real one
OMG ARC SYSTEM???
INVINCIBLE VS AND MARVEL COOKING A GAME NOW??? BOTH GAMES ARE GONNA BE PEAK!!!
The lead character designer is Kohei Horikoshi, mangaka of My Hero Academia
1:42 YO MAMA
Kamala Khan. Can't wait what her reaction will be when they introduce Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel
Dragon Ball Fighterz Marvel?
Marvel contest of champions by kabam is the best marvel game ever
so fresh
Everyone copying dbz fighter cool
It's a little bit more like build your own character with a combination of characters. Your team of 4 is more like one character. The way they use tags to continue combos off a hit is not like how other tag games are, in this it can be used as the hit confirm to a hit. They can also tag in off a block to counter hit. It's so interesting, it's like doing a special move on hit confirm in sf6. You can still call assists outside of hits and blocks, so it's not like it ISN'T a tag game. One life bar, assists are more like moves rather than complete other characters.
I can already see the leaderboards being dominated by Japan and South Korea 😂 but it looks cool
So this is basically dragon Ball fighter z with marvel characters. I'll play it
Close enough, welcome back MVC.
I work in marketing.  This trailer is a masterpiece.
I just cannot get over Storm's design. I want every X-men ever in this game because of it.
Werewolf by night please 🐺🌕
Marvel getting the Dragon Ball FighterZ treatment sounds great
Lore accurate Ghost Rider vs Scorpion
⚡1:39, SO BEAUTIFUL! MOTHA!!!!⚡
Why is Naruto not getting a game like this 😢
Marvel Fighterz
Miss Marvel's moves look like a carbon copy of Hsien-ko
son la voces de roy focker de macross
Here we go Sony being greedy as usual PlayStation exclusive first party is one thing,but 3rd party exclusives shouldn't exist anymore.
Now that's what I'm talking about! Real love for the franchise and its legacy. MARVELOUS!
4v4!!!!!!!! WOAH!!!
Oh my goodness gracious! This is one heck of a Japanese marvel video game made by Arc system works.
Dear Capcom you already lose credibility for delivering new fighting game IPs, Arc System Works on the other hand thrives and is filling the void, by carving their own legacy.
Marvel please! All we need is a Marvel platform fighter game and a Marvel MMORPG similar to DCUO , or simply a new Marvel Alliance with online play! and we’re set!!!! Y’all have been dropping masterpieces!
No Xbox?
i hope the fan base does not kill this game
CAPTAIN AMERICA VOICED BY YUICHI NAKAMURA (Known for his role as Gojo Satoru)⁉️   AND GHOST RIDER VOICED BY KATSUYUKI KONISHI (Known for his role as Diavolo or Pucci)⁉️😲
Will it come to the switch? I don’t have the money to buy a playstation 🥺
Haduken!!!
Marvel vs dragon ball fighter z
Dragon Ball FighterZ: Marvel Edition
I like the soundtrack. It feels like Pacific Rim.
@capcom just forfeit your IPs to Arc System Works and let them make your competitive fighting game, let them build you roster and one theres a base 2 -3  years down the road let Arc Systems Works make  "Marvel vs Capcom 20XX/2099"
finally I was geting tired of games with characters from other dimensions (assuming theres no alternate dimension nonsense here)
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
The gameplay looks insane
Looks great! Please 🙏 include Venom as a playable character and PLEASE have English voices
Looks sick
😮 This has to be the best fighting game ever. 4vs4? This game is going to be the ish!
ファンネル飛ばしそうなアイアンマンだな
This is just dbfz
Ironman is a Gundam now? neat haha
The Hulkbuster design looks pretty sick 2:00 👍👍
Dragon ball fighter z….
Is Tag Team Modus 2 player vs 2 player or 1 player vs 1 player?🤔🤔🤔🤔
2xko better tho
Looks good but the audio Is lackluster. Someone gets hit with a bomb and you hardly hear any sort of impact in it. Or any moves
Wow.. fire, just fire 🔥💯
i just realized there's the Fogwell's Gym. WE ARE GETTING THE DEVIL
this will be the best fighting game all time. amazing
Man Iron Man has been watching Gundam lately
Can we talk about the sick music
Meant to reply when this was revealed. Fun fact. This is the first Made In Japan Marvel standalone versus fighting in 30 years.   The last one was Capcom's Marvel Super Heroes in 1995.
It is good this is just a Marvel game. Then after this, give the people what they really really want. Marvel VS DC. That would be the most legendary crossover fighting game of all time. Magneto, Cyclops, Ms Marvel, Storm vs Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Joker. Make it happen.
Ansioso pelo lançamento!
0:59 That's Dante's super move. I just realized.
I hope they add the Fantastic Four.
This looks good, is it a new game, or old game remaster?
Marvel fighting game without Capcom is not a real fighting game. Just plain trash
Look like marvel vs Capcom
If you want a badass roster put Punisher, Blade, Gambit, Rogue, and Cyclops in at launch and I promise you everyone will be happy.
Holy vibranium i love the style
Marvel Minus Capcom
Pouring  one out for my fellow DC fans , we ain't getting any good games anytime soon.
MARVEL Dragon Ball Fighter Z, at first i thought it was a mod because of a short
0:37 Kamala My Girl!!!
why does doom have an auto lock on attack did we not learn anything from umvc3?
Have simple combat like arena fighters like demon slayer with tilt analog and Y for skill ability
Imma get cooked online 😭 but I’m still buying 💯
I just rewatched the trailer for a billionth time and noticed something. All of the changes in the music are when characters swap, and the music changes to reflect the character that just swapped in. Is this game gonna have adaptive music?
Doom finally getting a super for his pistol finally took my breath away ❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂
If this does well, I'd love to see an actual anime. The MCU is washed, and this would simply be a flawless replacement
Only PlayStation limits the potential to  be the best fighter game
🎉
I’m not even a fighting game fan but this looks really fun. The art design is truly impressive.
Marvel Fighterz 🤔
Any chance for Xbox or switch 2?  🤔
This is just Dragon Ball Fighters Z, but Marvel.
ストームの声は「沢城みゆき」かな？
This game bouta be 🔥
Daayyumm i'm so hyped for this!!!
Captain Capitalism Vs IronGundamMan
I have been dreaming Arc System works made marvel vs Capcom i guess this is as close its gonna get for now lol hopefully they release limited edition stuff for this game im def getting it
Will there be dramatic endings like in Dragon Ball FighterZ?🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
Add venom and I’ll buy it
Super heroes Guilty Gears
Drop venom and my life is yours
Skins, long combos ratio life bars please
Hopefully it is as good as it seems ... And not be like mvc3 ... ...
Arksys. Doesnt matter what the game. When you see this developer, you know you will get quality fighting game 🙏❤️
It's been a week and i've watched this trailer ATLEAST 100 times. This looks too good. Please dont mess this up.
I shouldn’t have to learn Spanish to know what’s being said about our county. Just saying
This japanese Spider man doesn't have his "Marveller, change Leopardon!" . 0/10
Please add a pushblock, dbfz was trash because there was no push block which means no neutral
名古屋弁は?
It better have the  taskmaster not the vomit on the movies
Bang this game was inspired by dragon ball fightersZ
Marvel Vs Capcom Substitute 💪🏼
Not doom pulling out the glock
Invincible VS looks better/ more fun.
Poor Stanley he never wanted to his characters fighting like this becouse he always told, my characters are like my son, and a father never want to see his sons fighting
Where's Leopardon?
Man this game is really boring stylistically
No  Foot Dive 💔🥀
i watched this 10 times , i keep slapping my self, this is so epic i can believe its really !! , this game will change fighting games scene for ever !!! love this so much i am coming bake to fighting games at age 36 , hell yeah !!!
xbox doesn’t exist in this universe……
They could’ve called it Marvel 4v4 to troll but Tokon is cool too
can’t wait for 2035 when we finally get the next MvC.
I could see me breaking my controller
Sengoku Basara + Marvel Super Heroes
This game is gonna be jam packed......with microtransactions.
Add Psylocke (Sai) here is perfer fit than Marvel Rivals
IS THAT FINGORIA/HANDERELLA?
8 characters? I smell paid DLCs
Dr.doom was coolwalking😂
this will be a amazing fighting game man, absolutely 😎 hopefully more character will show up
Marvel used the thumbnail from the official Playstation channel :)
looking great, brings back the marvel vs capcom vibe
why not Marvel BRAWL?
Stunning Animations!!! Every fighting game lover will own this game 😊
Marvel vs marvel: civil war
depending on how long assist cooldowns are just looks like it will be an assist spam game
Amazing art style. So vibrant and fresh
The King of Marvel XII
yeah 1:57 in and this is literally just fighterZ art wit MvC gameplay, ts not cool
all marvel no capcom? weak
lo que Riot en tanto tiempo aun no termina de hacer
I hope they release this too on the ps4 😢
ファンタスティック・フォーとかキャプテン以外のコマンドーチームみたいな4人組がチームが使えたら嬉しいな
Wanna see Thanos and Black Widow in this
Japanese vocals are making this even better and it looks pretty great already. Storm is slaying... yass Queen 😊
Ayy
Why are they speaking Japanese? I like anime, but Japanese Avengers is a weird association
gotta make this free to play like marvel rivals the fgc will explode
Free to play?
This is Injustice a few years later... Please bring the X-MEN as playable characters NO DLCS.
Actually do not care in the slightest if theres no capcom/snk characters. It will most likely be shallow as hell and not much of a competitor compared to other fighters out rn. Fighting with JUST marvel comica characters is actually not as special as they think it is. Like cool more marvel content just like the last 20 yrs or so.
Does anyone understand what the graffiti says at 1:18?
I can't believe this is happening!!!! Arcsys!!!!! Please!!!!! Give us daredevil nightcrawler and punisher!!!!!  Please!!!! 🙏
They gotta have more characters than this   Where’s magneto. Juggs. Sentinel  So many classic m v C 2 character missing. Many of which are marvel so it shouldn’t be a rights to character issue.
Marvel tokon é impressionante hype demais
From Tekken to Tokon, We've come a long way!
GIVE US BLACKHEART!!!! That’s all I want is Blackheart
Disney Marvel vs Capcom.
Nychris g gonna be taken this game championship,lol he’s is the king of all marvel games.
Seeing Japanese developers so lovingly recreate iconic Marvel characters in their kwn unique style is so cool. :)
Capcom: pensé que teníamos algo especial!!!
I didn't understand any of that
Is this 1v1?
Take my money
I can't wait to see Lythero make videos on this
It's Mahvel Baby!!!!
I said I’d retired from fighting games …..
Beta test for Marvel Vs Capcom 5 ? We also need Capcom Vs SNK 3 from Arc Studios would be Epic!
Robbie Reyes🔥🔥🔥
Better stop that vehicle!
I love how Ms. Marvel Kinda took the spotlight in this Trailer, I ain't gonna lie she looks good here too, plus they're probably gonna use her Elasticity, and Giagantic Abilities to the fullest here, unlike the Ms. Marvel movie, sure she did have those abilities but they were Rarely used, which kinda ruins her powers a bit, other than Ms. Marvel looking good here, MY GOD EVERYONE LOOKS SO BADASS HERE, AS A GHOST RIDER FAN HERE, I FEEL BLESSED!!!!
Truly Marvel Rivals
iron man gundam before gta 6 is crazy
Arcsys know how to make good looking fighting games
I definitely don't wanna play this with the audio in other Language. Love the Japanese audio, hit the vibe of an anime.
How many frames is this running at? Look very choopy
5 days later and I have still the same hype mind. What an awsome trailer
👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥
I want to guess that the Guilty Gear team is working on this
Very glad that the game will coming to steam as well!
Hopefully Arc ends up doing one with DC too :)
Marvel fighterz?
How can Storm look so good? 🥵  ArcSys artists are simply on another level. This is also the best design I’ve ever seen for Ms. Marvel, she looks so perfect. Every design looks incredible here. That Iron Man Gundam design is an instant classic.
OMG STORM!
No it's "Maaruveru vaasessu Maaruveru"
marvel’s video game department is single handedly keeping marvel alive in pop culture
I love the design of iron man’s armor, You can really see the Japanese influence. it looks great
If Spider-Man doesn’t say “Spider string!” Or claims he is the Emissary from hell, I will be sorely disappointed
Is this a Capcom game ?
I’m smelling classic MARVEL Vs. CAPCOM vibes from this awesome new fighting game here! No doubt!
This game is a NEED!
Looks like a much needed update . I kept saying to myself it's missing something then I'm like DUH ! It's missing Capcom . Ryu and Akuma I keep thinking their gna pop in there . Owell maybe later !
i wish this game should take all the players from 2xko since is dragging things out and won't release the game already.
I always wanted Arc to be the ones to do a DC game. I'll take this for now.
The graphics are beautiful but the design is very strange because it doesn't match anything that Marvel VS Capcom has ever done. Horrible. Marvel VS Capcom 3 isn't up to date but it's a thousand times better and more visually pleasing.It's the same as taking an anime and making it "Americanized". It took away the essence of what the comics represent.
Marvel Minus Capcom! Here we Go!!
So it's like a Marvel version of Street Fighter?
looks like buns bruh
Lol looks like dragonball fighterZ...  Or GranBlue fantasy
I hate this
I feel sorry for the invincible game
Where’s Ultimate Marvel Vs C 4 :( street3 (Remake no bring 3D) aeww   X-man vs StreeT?
I have a feeling Ant-Man will be in this!
Sem querer ofender mas... achei genérico e Buxa, prefiro o INVENCIVEL VS até pq esse marvel aí parece gulity gear e o dragon ball fither z
it would be so good if they are adding arc sys characters from their games we just randomly get vergil showing up
We’re not going outside in 2026
Bring on cyclops
They keep trying to make Ms. Marvel work
I wonder will in also have English VO
After what marvel rivals have done to me… 1:52 … you gotta LOVE to see it 🙂‍↕️🤌🏽
Invincible Vs Has A Better Art Style 2D Hybrid Stylized Animation Rather Then 2.5D Cel Shaded Stylized Animation
Cyclops, nightcrawler, quick silver, evan danials (spyke,) hulk, black panther, iceman, Bishop, venom, blade, war machine, blue marvel, Colossus, the thing, human tourch, red she-hulk, emma frost, jubilee, gambit
Do you think thiss game will be on xbox
I hope I see Juggernaut in the game
CMON MARVEL LETS MAKE ANOTHER MARVEL VS CAPCOM !!!!!!!
Ngl looks mid
Will the game be free?
Definitely inspired by dbz fighterz😂😂😂
This just makes me want a new mvc game not a fan of ark games
Okay this looks really fun, I can't wait to see more of this game
Besides the fact that it's real, looks this good, and is made by ArcSys, the two most exciting things about it are that it's not a crossover fighter and that it's 4v4. No Capcom characters means the entire roster will be Marvel, and 4v4 means the roster is gonna be HUGE. We're probably gonna get all of the Avengers, all of the X-Men, all major villains, we'll probably even get Spider-Verse characters like Miles and Gwen, and more underrated characters like Blade and Moon Knight. This is gonna be so good y'all
FINALLY!! I feel like I’ve been waiting decades for marvel characters to come back to a good fighting game or have one of their own!!!  The last marvel vs capcom was A$$
THESE CHARACTER DESIGNS LOOK SO GOOD OMG!  I CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY THIS! 😍
This tells you without Japan 🇯🇵, the gaming industry & Marvel would be in deep 💩.😁
Where is the league of legends mmo
This will probably be one of the best-selling fighting games of all time.
Needs to be on all CONSOLES!
DC take notes
Nice
Beyond Wolverine and The Hulk (wich are givens), I REALLY hope that the character's being referenced in the stage's background get to be playable, because seeing Dazzler, The Wasp, Daredevil and anyone from the FF in this style would be amazing  Fingers crossed for Black Panther and Angela as well
Ghost Rider and Dr Doom right off the bat, that's very cool.
VIVRANIUM NO SHIELDO
めっちゃおもろそうやん
Yellow Speech Bubble: Hey Deadpool! What's with that gun in hand?  Going to the Ark? Bring Shuma-Gorath with you?  OK, go for it!
😮
do not forget to add MARROW the bone growth girl !
C'mon, Next is Marvel vs Capcom 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
X-Men: Children of Atom and Marvel Super Heroes reincarnated. 😇👍
Marvel: I don’t want to play with you anymore. *Drops Capcom*
Ms marvel looks cute   Ironman likes Gundam amazing 🤩🤩  Dr doom and ghostrider looks epic
Watch it in slow mo
I narrowed my character wish list down to 10: 1) Kikyo from the Marvel Wolverine Madhouse Anime. 2)Nidel from Phoenix Legacy of Fire. 3) Kitty Pride from X-Men Misfits. 4)Armor from the X-Men Madhouse Anime. 5) Spotted Cat from the Spider-Man J  Manga. 6) Akira from the Marvel Disc Wars Anime. 7) Makoto from the Future Avengers Anime. 8) Deathal from the Spider-Man Shonen Jump Manga. 9)Black Cat. 10)Red Ronin.
It's even better because it's a pure game without Capcom characters. We really welcome this.
I bet this won’t have blade In it smh 🤦🏿‍♂️
bro this and invicble WE ARE S0 BACKKKKKKK
👁 wanna get it bruvs 👌🏽..
I'm old now, 4v4 is a bit overwhelming but I am here for it.
When I saw Marvel + Arc Sys, I knew this trailer would be 1000% awesome....and it did NOT disappoint! My god this is going to be beyond epic!!!!
Oh my god thank you for saving marvel fighting games
I'll actually be surprised if Venom isn’t in this game.
Akiyama as Starlord is wild
Ok, now please add Gambit, Omega red, a Sentinel and Venom...thanks in advance!
Let’s go 🔥
Marvel minus Capcom!!
2:10 This shot convinced me to main Star-Lord when this masterpiece comes out.
koichi yamadera as star lord? Take my money!!!
That looks amazing.
The level of detail in this game is insane
we got gundam iron man before gta 6
WHERE'S WOLVERINE????!!!??????
My #1 character request, Jeff the Landshark. Marvel Rivals doesn't want Jeff players to have fun anymore, so it'd be nice to see him here.
YES!!!!
Could’ve been fighterz 2 but I digress game looks *fantastic*
Graphic = 🤮
So I have to learn 4 characters?
これ絶対悪魔博士の語録使って実況する人おるやろｗ
Marvel vs Fighterz in 2030.
those cinematic super at the end are absolutely gorgeous.
abandoned by disney and capcom? bleh! Thanks ARC!!!
Marvel Super Heroes 2!
Doomondorf
Marvel Superheroes 2: Marvel Mangaverse!
Hey disney, Add predator and alien, you own the IP's, DO it.
GHOST RIDERRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Here for classic skins
I hope Sabretooth makes the roster!!
1:42 i just notice that Storm can call rain to push down the enemy. Interesting! Edit: or is it wind?
This isn’t coming to Xbox?
This game will be loved by everyone!
Have we entered a new golden age of Marvel games?
Aye real talk, did anyone ask for this? 🤣😭
This game looks absolutely great! Finally another marvel fighting game! And Ghost Rider is in it!
More typical fighting trash clones. Injustice, MK, Smash, etc 🥱🤦‍♂️ Bring back Def Jam FFNY style fighting games.
Quem sabe Marvel vs SNK futuramente🎉
I’m so tired of fighting other heroes lol I need a new multiplayer team up game 😂😭
Thank God for FOX acquisition! Thank you from the bottom of my heart! I grew up on MvC and i am so excited for this! Never thought id see another fighting game with XMEN in it!
Copie 😂😂😂 from Dragon ball fighter Z. 😂😂
hey i mean marvel vs guilty gear would be pretty cool
The age of marvel movies is over, the time for marvel games has come.
Good enough welcome back mvc
its looks like guildy gear strive. Nothing special for now
The spider man is the Insomniac spider man the front spider logo is changed to black and back logo is the original classic logo and I gotta say it looks good.
Se ve hermoso... Fluido, la jugabilidad también se ve bastante bien... Mejoraron el diseño de Miss Marvel... Lo único que personalmente no me gusta, es el diseño de Iron-man (parece un Gundam) y el diseño del Cap (de no ser por el escudo, no se le reconoce)... Pero luce espectacular este juego. Con el solo tráiler, ya es mucho mejor que Marvel vs Capcom Infinite.
C'mon guys, Anime and Japanese doesn't have to be implemented into everything. Don't get me wrong, I love the game but DC did the batman ninja anime stuff doesn't mean that marvel should too.
I wonder if Norio Wakamato will voice a villain.
LETS GO ITS ARCSYS
Bro, it's literally dbz figthers👀👀👀
Needs more X-Men
I just had japanese spiderman flashbacks from this
God I hope this game includes a dedicated button for blocking and not just pushing back 😭😭
IT'S MAHVEL BABY!!!!  I've watched this too many times 😂
Capcom, people are tired of you guys making 1 good game then 3 DUDS...it's over LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Is this mvc3?
Sonic fox boutta go crazy
This is literally Dragon Ball FighterZ and that’s why this game looks peak.
Marvel Super Heroes vs. X-Men
Khan has got to be one of the most astroturfed characters in recent Marvel media.
"World Martial Arts Champion Spider-Man"
I love how a simple game trailer opens up a plethora of questions about the state of Disney, Marvel and Capcom.
I just hope they dont release and abandon it like every other licenced fighting game theyve made (except DBFZ)
I wish they would expand the roster from 24.
Day one buy for me
I am eagerly awaiting the release of the game; it looks like it will be spectacular <3
feels fighter Z esc
Speechless, just perfect
ArcSys stays GOATED.   Riot Games found dead in their home.
i keep coming back to this trailer whenever it pops up on youtube recs, i cant wait to get my hands on this garbage (affectionate)
Marvel is cooking this year
Wait...why are X-Men characters in this 2D fighting game?  I thought that they were just functions?  (this is sarcasm, btw)
I'm not big into fighting games but I played MK10 and I liked it. Skipped MK1 because I don't particularly like tag fighters. I loved SF6, great gameplay, great soundtrack, great art direction.  I don't like tag teams however this game looks neat visually. All the best luck, hope it turns out amazing.  Also the doom guy teleporting behind then nothing personal kid'ing the opponent is funny as heck.
All we need now are Wolverine, Magneto & Green Goblin.
Gotta hope and pray for a story mode
I NEED MORE DOOM SWAG
Looks exactly like every Japanese fighter to me. Could be called Marvel Street Fighter. But better than nothing I guess. Meanwhile DC:...
Captain America made in Asia looks more AMERICAN, than Captain America made in America. LoL, wokeness has destroyed western talent and art.
MORE GRAPHICALLY BEAUTIFUL than the last Marvel Vs Capcom. Capcom lost it touch.
Урааааааа
Tony Stark out here looking like Iron Kamen Rider lol. And is Spidey's design a slight reference to the old 70's Japanese Spidey?
My Wishlist 😍: Thanos, Silver Surfer, Adam Warlock Fantastic Four, Scarlet e Vision, Deadpool and Wolverine, Cyclops, Gambit,  Magneto, Hulk, Thor, Loki, Blade e Dracula, Phoenix, Iron Fist, Daredevil e Moon Knight
All I know is that Storm is a BADDIE!! 🤤   1:38   We must stay focused, brothas we MUST... stay focused.
Why in the world did Marvel + Disney force Arc System Works to put Ms Marvel in the game? They are pushing the dumbest charter ever made by marvel. A complete waste of roster space in the game. They could have  put anyone else in the game, and it would have been way better.
I'm hoping it has a solid fighting system more like SF3 or SF4 rather than MvC3 with the cheap infinite combos
Would like to see Makoto from Future Avengers Anime, Kikyo from the Madhouse Marvel Anime, Akira from the Disk Wars Anime, Nidel from Phoenix Legacy of Fire, Spotted Cat from the Spider-Man J Manga, Deadpool's villain T Ray, Cable, Jubilee, Blade The Vampire Hunter, X-Men's Surge,  Marvel's Dracula, Hit Monkey, Howard The Duck, Sakura Spider from the Deadpool Manga, Ben Grim, The Incredible Hulk, Bishop, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, The manwha characters Aero and Sword Master, Werewolf by Night, Cosmo The Space Dog, Goose The Flerken, Marvel's Frankenstein, Morbius, Old Lace from Runaways, Orphan from X-Statix, Death's Head, Deathlok, Squirrel Girl, Moon Knight, Miles Morales, Deadpool, Wolverine, and Kitty Pride from the X-Men Misfits Manga, and Tigra.
I'm not a very good 2D beat em up player, but this has peaked my interest!
no Capcom 💔💔
Ironman looking like a Gundam is something I've never seen in my life.
지린다,,,
Marvel Superheroes 2
This trailer is too good
DDUUDDDEEE I NEED THIS SONG ON SPOTIFY NOW
For the boys
Capcom saw this video 1.1K times.
ah yes, arc PEAK works.
seems worse than marvel vs capcom.
Special guest character        kyo kusunagi.and rugal bernstein
Spidey looking dope with the white on his suit.
2xko's wig snatch and found crying in the corner
Something about Spider Man yelling "SPIDEY SENSE" while dropkicking someone is so funny to me.
That’s crazy how it’s not dropping on Xbox lol
Looks like marvel rivals with marvel capcom gameplay
There was a badass Marvel fighting game that was being developed that ended up getting scrapped though and it had world damage so within the area your fighting in you can destroy buildings etc and the graphics look way ahead of it's time.
Can’t wait to play Goku.
I REALLY hope they have spider-man's traditional idle pose from the Versus series, small detail but so iconic!
The ironman looks like a gundam and i love it😂
I'm so looking forward to seeing Takuya Yamashiro summoning Leopardon. <3
PLEASE add Miles Morales to this game!
R.I.P Marvel Contest of champions
Marvel contest of champions style capcom
HASTA QUE DIOS NOS HIZO EL MILAGRO Y ARC SYSTEM WORKS HIZO UN FIGTHING DE MARVEL😯😲😳🤩🤗😎!!!!!
I love how Starlord calls himself "ore-sama"
Arc's magic
im gonna credit maximillian dood for helping keep the MvC vibe alive. his mod for MvC infinite is beautiful.
This looks like it takes more actual mechanical skills to play compare to marvel rivals
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 LG!
Marvel vs. Guilty Gear X BlazBlue! Make it happen ARCS! Take my money and all that I am. My body is ready!
Like they fighting style but the heros look really really bad, why Peter quill has a dwarfs body shape and captain america looks like a transformer, iron man look like mega man in red
4 vs 4 !! Maneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee lol
Capcom: “word for word, bar for bar”… “Don’t let them get a hold of DragonBall… it’ll be revenge season
Hace tiempo que un trailer no me tenia tan enganchado, varias veces volvi a reproducirlo, la musica, el estilo artistico, los personajes, todo se ve genial en este juego!
Japan delivers the goods. as always.
So, Street Fighter or Guilty Gear crossover when?
Trailer is straight up fire, love this
finally...after all these years... SUPADAMAN IS BACK!!!
Arc? Yeah, instant cop
thank God sony choose Ark system works for this. love the art style of ark system they are the best.
this is straight fire
Guilty Marvel gear ultimate strive
Dr. Doom is awesome
Can’t wait to see how they gonna do Venom, hopefully add Gambit and war machine and Luke cage
Marvel really out here dominating every genre in gaming. Let me get Marvel Heroes Omega back! Haha
シーハルクが待ちきれない！
格ゲーはコラボも期待されるところだと思う。集英社の僕のヒーローアカデミアとコラボしてみてほしいな。
this looooks AMAZING!!!! thank you for choosing Arc to work with you. LOVE the japanese twist and polish to it!!!!! this was definitely the highlight to the State of Play.
please tell me that's not all of the characters.
I'm 40 im mv2 alumni. My whole life has led me to this 1 game. JESUS!
Keef brought me here
Puraistation...and PC
Similar like dragon ball
At last they got rid of those stupid Capcom characters
When does this come out
looks like reskinned street fighter
Since it's a 4v4, the game will be perfect when it has all of the members of Fantastic Four!
Marvel has good movies and games, unlike DC , which has trash movies and trash games.
Loving this Vision Gran Turismo Iron Man
Game is dead on arrival
Protesting hard how dare you cheat on capcom hahah
Love the anime style.
Arc system needs to do a new MvC
Marvel continues being the "Gallant" to DC's "Goofus" in gaming.
There's tons of characters that you can use without crossing with any other company it's not necessary.
Awesome
Marvel guilty gear... Can't wait for this one
Ms Marvel looks so cute
Wow Xbox is dead
Is that Horikoshi’s Spidey?😧😮‍💨💯🔥
Surely you don't mean Tempest is voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro.  I'll probably not even buy the game, but i already know who i'll main.
im only playing in japanese btw. HOLY MOLY DOOM GOES SO HARD
Man, this is literally Dragon Ball FighterZ with Marvel skins, even the 200 DLC's characters. Venom like a one DLC character and things like that.
Did i just see a combo with starlord cap n doom 💀
This doesn't feel right without Ryu or Akuma 😂
This is literally what I’ve been saying Marvel vs Capcom should be like.  I feel like it’s such a huge missed opportunity that this is not our MvC4 but the game looks super sick!
And that was the end of marvel versus Capcom
This is SO cool! So many awesome characters and more could be coming! Avengers,Xmen,Guardians of the galaxy and Fantastic four will look awesome here too!😊
They finally understand this is the type of graphics we need for fighting games
OH MY GOD 😯
0:56 is word for word, bar for bar, Dante’s super from Marvel Vs. Capcom infinite. They didn’t even try 😂
Give us He-Man ,G.i.joe,transformers,Thundercats with the same energy
They’re still trying to keep inserting Kamala Khan. What a waste of a character slot.
Mvci could never be like this this is how you make a marvel fighting game in fact mvci was disappointing because it didn’t even have returning characters or brand new mechanics the only new things were infinity stones and a few new characters that were underwhelming This feels like it could have the potential to give us new and returning characters that we wanted from mvci
just wait until HE returns
I'm so HYPED and PUMPED for this Brand Newest 4-on-4 Japanese Fighting Marvel Video Game for next year in 2026! This is going to be Super Awesome, Epic and Hardcore!
Capcom was in the way for me, so I am VERY stoked for this
Guys, this game is from the creators from guilty gear strive. Guilty gear strive is freakin' awesome. And Sony + Marvel basically gave these guys infinite budget.   This game will be insane.
This game should NOT have an English voice cast,  It's just way too perfect in Japanese
Who else is waiting for the anime now?!
It's peak.
When does it come out?
It's good that there is no envy among Japanese companies and they take advantage of the global entertainment exchange.
Captain Japonica is here!
no foot dive
Arc system works does the make a blazblue game challenge  (They're losing)
Wow marvel super heroes awakening to an awesome fighting game
absolute heat 🔥
Marvel fighterZ even the same move when they attack.... but cool game
Marvel Gear
😶
There was a good fighting game on og Xbox that was sick dnt remember what
Marvel is coming in clutch with these games they are making. This new game is Marvel vs. Capcom, and Marvel Rivals had a baby together, in a good way.
My wish list - SHANG CHI, Cyclops, Wolverine, Black Panther, Gambit, Juggernout, GLADIATOR, Phoenix, Blade
Fighting games are nice and all but no open world MMORPG, fighting games (at least to me) after a while they lose their luster but a revamped better version of ultimate alliance would sell A LOT quicker, doing different open world missions with a group, YES!
This is so CLEAN!
Please, take my money 💸
It has fightersZ soul in it I can see it..
Why this game is similar to guilty gear strive?
Marvel is hiring Asian developers, which makes me think they're abandoning Western policies of forced inclusion.
ArcSystem - Respect!!!!
Marvel anime >>>>>>>>>>>> Rick and Morty anime
SUPAIDI  SENSU
Super heroes hablando en japones ... q clase de Boku No Hero es este.
This looks awesome but, fighting games die to quick. It takes forever to find matches on strive ..
Looks Like a mix of Street Fighter x Marvel
I always loved it when Spiderman shouts right before he attacks, "SPIIIIDEYYYY SEEENSE!!!!" 😂😂😂
its cool 2d fighting games are making a comeback just a shame the hand drawn style isnt making a comeback too. this looks like it was designed by a computer i dont think the style will hold up over time at all. imagine if the developers were tasked to make it look like a saturday morning cartoon intro during gameplay, ahhh if only
How many characters will there be?
Tava na hora da arc system, mostrar como se faz um jogo de luta legal!.
Please, I only want Iron Fist, please put it in
Toppppp
Some one fixt the multiverse, now, we are in the correct reality
So...is marvel cool again?
Please have a good roster 😭😩
I NEEEEED a Nightcrawler announcement.
GHOSTAH RIDAH
yhea... 2XKO is in problems...
I already forgot about those horrible MCU phases.
How is nobody talkin about the music?! It sounds so epic!!!
Japanese Iron Man hits different
This looks awesome!
So, this is really just modern day marvel vs capcom lol
TL/DL: I will buy this game, if there's NO DLC and/or SEASON PASS.  Except... Check the "Con section"   First impression -   Pros:  1. Like Marvel Vs Capcom back in the days, air combos is fun to play, and fun to watch = Perfect for streaming and e-sport viewership. 2. Knock each other out of the wall into other scene, fresh & nice change of scenary. 3. 4v4 instead of 3v3, like #2, fresh, and potential. 4. Arc System = Good fighting game DNA, reputation worthy of people's initial attention. 5. Animation is Japanese style = fun, nice, and stylish (Storm's facial expression looks more than hot & attractive, much like a warrior lady-like, similar to the first wonder woman movie impression.) 6. Like #5, Marvel girl's Voice Acting especially... VA makes the characters more lovable  Now, POTENTIAL CONs.  1. Temptation to ***SEASON PASS***, there are a lot of characters from Marvel, keep it a handy 50-60 for 4v4, and that's it. Reasoning: a) Balancing! (This ruined Dead or Alive Series) b) Feeling of never ending Money grab. c) You are actually stopping new entry gamers to joining into this game.  2. From trailer, only 8 characters, so BALANCE of involved characters is important, as rough estimate, 50-60 should be a decent number for 4v4 format. (Under the context that every characters is well balanced and/or counter-able to each other.)  ****SUGGESSTIONS*****  I want to buy this game, I want to see it bring back the glory of Marvel Vs. Capcom 2, for decade long glory. So here are my suggestions as an unprofessional gamer/viewer.  1. I know you need to make money, and the current fighting game is not as crazy as MOBA games, I get it. That's why the more reason for you to refrain from DLC, use this game for a good FOUNDATION for the genre.  2. For making money, try focus on making SKINS, like Dead or alive.   DLC SKIN only is good to attract players to spend more money or stay with game, and it does not affect BALACING When you DLC heros, you face problems with: a) Balacing: extra resource requirement from development team b) Discouraging new players to purchase title: People doesn't have enough money to buy a "FULL GAME" + "Required DLC" just to start a game/genre which will make them lose a lot to begin with.  3) When you really really have to DLC characters, keep it OUT of Marvel, aka external collaboration; it's good for everyone: a) Justify for the extra price tag. b) Use each "Collaboration" as a version benchmark, good to avoid balancing issues and still attracts new players to join THIS GAME.  4) If you look at Tekken, Street Fighters...etc, sure they have a lot of season pass and dlc, but that's because: a) Players doesn't have much choice b) Those dev. team are in the "GAME" for decades, they are the leading giants, and they make the rules.  So if you want to CONVINCE PLAYERS to divert their time and money to YOU, try to do it a more sincere and old-school way: GIVE THE PLAYERS THE ACTUAL FULL GAME with ONLY ONE PRICE TAG.  Charge us $80 or $90, but don't do different versions, DLCs, Season Passes. You are Marvel Empire that can afford to pay an actor/actress 10+ Millions for a movie, surely you have the resources to sell a "FULL GAME" like developers back in the days?  ...I sure hope so, otherwise, I rather play MOBA, at least new players keeps coming into the communities.  Have a nice day people.
4v4 on the same screen????
For the dlc pack we need some capcom, guilty gear and also some dragon ball z fighters included in this game!
This will be sonys second GAAS thats successful based on the comment section .base game with a small roster,then character unlocks through purchase
Marvel Gear Fighterz: Stride
Will this game have English dub?
When's Magik
Coming to Exa Boxo?
The gaming industry has been in shambles for 15 years. Theres only 1,000 people on earth who will actually play this and enjoy it. Smh😪
Sorry for my ignorance, but I have some questions...  1 : Why the main trailer is Japan speak?  2 : it's possible a mix of mechanics between Guilty Gear, DBZ, and Marvel VS Capcom?  3 : Why the Character look like "teenagers Manga cartoon"??
Was lowkey waiting for starlord to yell LEGENDARRRY with a Japanese accent
Cap just hit 👍🏻 emotes
It's going down 4 on 4...😮😅
Arc system: It's my turn 😎😎😎
0:58 dante ? 😮
Is this dragon ball fighter Z
Marvel Kombat!!! 😂  Can't wait to get this, it looks sick!
Im gonna be into this more than marvel rivals (i jst cant get good in that ow 2.0 like game)
So Marvel v. Capcom without Capcom characters…cool. 😂
We're so back?
yall so dumb before yall did marvel vs capcom 4 in this art style u did this instead?
Just needs more Moon Knight but otherwise looks great. Venom and Daredevil too.
They actually have a great design for Kamala Khan. That's kind of impressive to me.
Arc System Works are always in their bag,aren't they?
So hapoy this game exists, at the same time, im sad this isnt coming out on Xbox Series X or Nintendo Switch 2 as well
IDK why its in Japanese, but that made it even better ngl
So its essentially Dragonball FighterZ but with Marvel characters.
Man! Im a big sad db fighterz hasnt gotten any support for a long time but ill definitely take that!
Why didn't we get the REAL Japanese spider man? The one with the gun?
Eastern game developers >>>
YES!!!! DEAR GOD YES!!!!!!
Capcom present- oh wait
Is this like street fighter and marvel vs Capcom mixed together?
I think Capcom is seething after seeing this trailer
Marvel: We're making a 4v4 fighting game with Dr. Doom and X-Men.  DC: Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.... You guys like live-services, right? Evil Supermen are what you want, no?
Marvel vs Marvel: the fate of MCU.
これが『 カプコン VS DC 』を制作するきっかけとなる
No X-men? 👀
Stop stuttering! please use fist, not mouth !
why'd they have to make it all japanese tho
so... the world really is healing
Playteishon
I heard GINTAMA voices here 😂
Arc system works?
Gorgeous artwork! 😍
Another marvel vs Capcom type gameplay style😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Fasten your seatbelts." 🔥 The amount of epic is overwhelming 🔥
it doesnt seem like its gonna have a lot of characters...
Take my money already!!
Ahora podre tener mi propio civil war? GOD!
نانى ؟
マブマベ
Boku no hero feelings
Bro if this game is for free it’s the best game ever
Typical wokebox L😂
Inavengers
Gooners Arise
Feels very DBFZ lol
That one star lord attack reminded me of Dante's  special marvel v capcom 3
Very good. Leave it to japan to drop this kind of amaizingness
wait I thought spiderman in japan used gun, no?
Everyone mention a new character you would like to see, or old one
Marvel vs Marvel? No, its Marvel Super Heroes 2
When's Tekken x Tokon?
So many characters in my head. Such as cyclops , nightcrawler , magik , moon knight , gambit , Otto octavius and green goblin 😁😁
The last boss is Apocalypse and his Horsemen 😅
Something fresh with inspirations from the best in the past.  loved it. Truly needed something like this! The roster looks small but will increase probably.
captain america voiced by yuichi nakamura just like in MCU
❤ my heart just grew three sizes watching this trailer!
This hits different when it’s handled and treated so well by the japs
Ms. Marvel straight up using Battletoads mechanics: Heavy Fist, Tilt-a-whirl Punch, and Da Big Boot! Gotta love Arc System Works!
bruh what?! YESSSS!
Arc system work is what got me super excited 🔥
Maybe it's bcs I don't love mvc3 so much, I feel I'm waiting this game since mvc2.
So Marvel's gonna take over the gaming world
This is a fever dream I was hoping Arc Systems would make MvC4 but this is still amazing!
I can't stop watching this
1:21 i just been going back and forth replaying doom and his theme
ITS MAHVEL BABY
They did the imposible,  they made Miss Marvel cool
Capcom: "Oh no...not again"
Dragon Ball Fighter Z?😂
no steam page
Between Guilty Gear Strive, DBFZ, and this, ArcSys does _not_ miss
This Spider-Man going to be better than capcoms
It reminds me of dragon ball fighter z
So we're finally getting an injustice style marvel game with their own touch? Let's goooo!
Capcom: "Marvel? I thought what we had was special!!"
Thank you.
I'm litterally screaming & tearing up because it's Mahval baby😭😭😭 & it's ARC SYS who has resurrected it!!!   4v4 sounds scary & like a lot tho, but we will see!
Xbox or Switch 2 please 😢
At this point my Only question is voice actors or AI for the English voiceovers?
I can’t wait.
2xko en sueur...
Hearing japanese marvel is more epic than the english one.
I need my big boys team: Blackheart, Jagganaut, Hulk, and someone else.( No, sentinel,  plz NO.)
Talking about wallbreak, I feel they should add "landbreak" like something happened in "xmen vs sf", that would be so cool.
I can already hear Hulk Smash from a distance. 🗿💚
Replace 'o' with 'e'
Marvel Super Heroes 2: Tokon
This is like When i was little kid, Going to Arcade and you saw "Marvel vs Street fighter" 😂❤
Will this be coming to the Nintendo 64?
Add Venom w the green salivation
hope have guest character from fighter layer
DBFZ 2 Let’s goooooooo
Thought is was made from CAPCOM😅😅😅
I was expecting doom to say foot dive or futo daibu.
Wow 😮😊
it takes anime to make Kamala Khan okay
見るからにワクワクする映像
I can’t be be excited about this game until I see some big bois 🦾
Looks like the real spiritual successor of Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 (not mvc infinite)
It's not the same without capcom :(
Photon shot
I like how Ironman had Vfin
9.5/10 No Footdive
looks amazing
The fact that you guys chose Robbie Reyes Ghost Rider instead of Johnny Blaze warms my heart. Nothing against Blaze, but it's nice to see the current era of Ghost Riders, especially coming from 2K's Marvel Midnight Suns. Robbie is quite something!
Wow do they have a LOT of DLC to go.
I'm expecting this to lean heavily on the MCU for the roster but I'm hoping Psylocke is in.
I still prefer the english version
looks amazing I hope they got huge roster and not 10 season passes
So Iron Man is Gundam 😅
DRAGON BALL FighterZ  Marvel Mode
アイアンマンがガンダムになってて草
Please, we need this on X-Box too!
I need the song yesterday
Arcades finna explode
This universe will be canon if Ghost Rider dies
1:20 ghost rider just got hit by the slap of doom
Between this and Cosmic Invasion, Marvel games are absolutely cooking right now. DC needs to step up. It ain't that hard to figure out. Fighting games and beat'em ups are sure bets. They're leaving money on the table by not doing the simple thing. It's amazing how people get in power and have no clue what to do.
Why play this when marvel vs Capcom 3 exists?
Here's hoping Arc will go subversive for this game like for DBFZ and use "Marvel abridged" dialogue.
Does the gameplay remind anyone else of Dragon Ball FighterZ? I can't help but feel a connection.
MARVEL VS MARVEL, AHHHHHHHHHHHH
Looks amazing!
Can't wait 😍
That's got to be dragon ball fightersz version right ?
Let marvel cook bro they are cooking right now bro
This soundtrack is going to burn my ears off in the best way
Another step toward a Marvel Vs. DC Mortal Kombat game, let's GO!
Haven’t had one of these in a while.
80's Baby here: This game should've followed after Marvel vs Capcom 2: NAOH.   🔥 🔥
Hope to see my fav character, Juggernaut
Need a remake of Rise of the Imperfects please
I also really gotta say... this anime mech styled Iron Man armor is so totally lit on all sides, bro.
Looks like DBFZ but 4v4 instead of 3v3 and w/ Marvel Characters.  Pretty cool
Uffff SPAIDAMAN!!! ❤
Is that... the playstation/insomniac version of Spider-Man, woah.
guilty gear: Marvel mods package
Looking good
The voice acting sounds so cringey.
a reskin of dbz. meh. and being comboed for 10 minutes is wack and boring
The Ghost Truk is Real!!!!
No GoG, no purchase. Tired of the DLC rosters that should be unlockables through playing the game.
Holy absolute F***!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
캡콤이랑 같이 하다가 짤린 울버린, 블랙 하트, 태스크마스터 다시 참전했으면 좋겠다 ㅠㅠ  개인적으로 레드스컬도 나와줬으면 좋겠다. 블랙팬서나 베놈 같은 인기캐들도 나와주고.  전작의 캡콤이 만든 작품은 디자인만 좋은 쓰레기였어...
If we don't get whacky 70s japanese spiderman as a skin, i'll be disappointed
Dragon ball fighterz but marvel
xbox?
The art style is awesome btw. It’s like a mix between a manga and a comic book 🔥
This game is amazing
I don’t even like fighting games but this is hype!
Did Cap just do a Rider Kick?
fire❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
At first was skeptical but this looks fun
I can’t get over how corny Marvel characters sound in Japanese. I love anime but this is so weird ngl. BEAUTIFUL GAME THO 🔥😭
1:20 悪魔博士！？
Why is there a weird 1 second delay every few hits
0:58 Dante "Jackpot" hyper move from MVC3
marvel should have always been anime 😭
Iron Man: "Ore wa Gundamu."
How many big name VAs can we shove in a game??
no capcom????   ZZZZZZZZZ....
Bruh…
Ok, you can have my money 🤑
I hope can play at android AetherSX2 ps2
Wow, just wow. Like Jo Jo's Bizarre Adventure and Fatal Fury had a three way with Marvel Comics, and this was the product of such a union. Epic awesomeness!
2026???
God bless the japanese artists and game designers.
Anyone else get X-Men animated series theme song vibes towards the end of this video?
Que estuviera el doctor dom y Tom Rider.   Uf cine
Los diseños me recuerdan mucha a ia xdd
Really tho ?? Out of everything they could’ve possibly given us … really smh
The graphics are sick
Marvel superheroes 2
dragon ball fighterz x tekken x marvel
THE MUSIC!!
This looks very good and well polished 💫✨.
Starlord
Since we never got a new marvel vs capcom. This will do!!!!!!!!!
Please add more characters......this game would seriously need it. Looks crazy!!!!!!
te extraño capcom :c
Considering Arc System Works job on Dragon Ball Fighterz with the stretchy models I can see why they chosw Miss Marvel, she was basically made for them ahah
I hope there’s English dub for this
Hope switch lite gets it
It's mahvel, baybee.
yay more marvel slop.
What's the over/under on woolie not learning from his mistakes?
ARC System Works is humiliating Capcom with this, in my opinion Capcom has been making very ugly characters since Street Fighter 4, they are short, chubby and ridiculous characters, with ugly proportions.
Marvel pero kamen rider
I love Ms. Marvel's run cycle and embiggened punches and kicks. Absolutely perfect aesthetic!  Spider-Man's looking pretty great, too. I definitely have a thing for the larger spider emblems (see: black costume, Ben Reilly, Mayday Parker), and the silvery bits are interesting. _(Does he basically have knuckle dusters here?)_  Iron Man and Dr. Doom are definitely evocative of Japanese mechs and armored heroes, like Gundams, modern Ultra Man, and Kamen Rider.  Storm... has _a lot_ going on. I'll just leave it at that. Also, I loved the look of her backhanding Doom across his silly metal face.
DC better not copy Marvel
MARVEL RIVALS - NOW THIS OMGGGGGGGGGGG 🫶🏾😍 THANK YOU
So... Marvel FighterZ. Looks good.
Let’s go
It's over I can see it now fighting game of the year 💯
I swear they are going to do seasonal and holiday DLC such as characters, costumes, & maps! Halloween: *Hobgoblin, *Black Suit Spiderman, and *A Haunted Forest! Christmas: *Iceman, *????, and *A Snowy Mountain Side
RIP Figtherz
Just take my money 😋
Street fighter x DBZ fighterz x Marvel had a baby
It’s like Tatsunoko vs. Capcom X Marvel vs Capcom series but it’s Marvel vs Marvel.
no switch 2 love?
Marvel vs Capcom Infinite tanked the franchise so hard Marvel just said "nah, Imma do my own thing"
Aw man… it’s a tag fighter.. 😢
For Dr. Doom, I buy.
Imagen a "Marvel vs Arc System Work's"
They wasted years making an MvC game just to remove Capcom 💀  Every day, we drift further from God’s light…
Sequel: Marvel vs. Guilty Gear
MAHVEL BABYEEE
MARVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEL  ADD MOON KNIGHT AND DAREDEVIL TO THIS GAME, AND MY LIFE IS YOUUUUUUUUUUUURS
Dang.  Marvel Minus Capcom 4 looking really good.  I'm happy for everyone that this is for!
Has anyone noticed a certain similarity with DRAGON BALL FIGHTERZ?
Where's Spiderman with a gun???
First Rivals now this?! They never miss
I though was MVC 4 😅
I’ll play it
登場キャラクターがヒーローアニメの熱血キャラになってますね。かっこいい。
First rivals then this marvel dropping bangers
Change the language to English.
Now this is a game to be excited for, not punk ahh Mario kart. This and ghost will make me buy a ps5💯
If Tony and Peter don't get giant mecha in this to help them fight, I'll be very disappointed.
Bro how is this not coming to Xbox!!!!!!!

This looks insane
I'm not impressed by any of this but, I'm glad Marvel games are going up in quality.
Man everybody trying to do what MR does :P
4 vs 4? what a mess 🧐
Disney's Marvel*
日本語だけど、世界の人はそれで良いのかな？ 私はレオパルドンが登場したら買おうと思います
Why japanese?
after 2 nuclear bombs and 80 years we can say JAPAN WON
I THOUGHT this was a new TEKKEN
if it ain't Marvel vs Capcom I'm not playin it
coal
Doom with da blicky. What will he do
I want a 1 v 4
So this is why arcsys gave us that terrible 3v3
This hard fr
Nice
I wish MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls was Rated T by ESRB, Rated 12 by PEGI, Rated 12 by USK, Rated 12+ by RARS, Rated B by CERO, Rated 12+ by GRAC, Rated M by ACB, Rated M by OFLC, Rated 14 by ClassInd, Rated B15 by SMECCV, Rated 13 by FPB, Rated PG 12 by GSRR, Rated 12 by GAMR, Rated 14+ by CCC, Rated 12+ by ESRA, Rated 12+ by IARC, Rated 13+ by IGRS, and Rated 12 by KAVI
First Marvel Rivals and now this Marvel giving DC a Tough compilation
Marvel vs wannabe Capcom, but also Marvel.
Marvel minus Capcom
jogaço de luta da marvel
It's nice that they finally figured out that you need some physical feedback during those long freeze-frame impacts, but I'd be happier if they made the characters visibly react (vibrate) like in SFV/6 and others.  Just having characters sit there frozen when they just got punched really steals away from any sense of impact.
I will be there
Marvel vs marvel
I like the drawing style of the originals. They should go back to that
2D fighters are my absolute favorite and this one looks like so much fun. I can already see myself spending so many hours on this
Are they really gonna talk this much during the fights or is it just like this for the trailer? lol That is way too much yapping for a fighting game
Hmm....MARVEL chars seasoned with soy sauce. Tasty....🤔🤤👍💯
I bet $100 that there’s someone out here that’s gonna make a Dio mod for this game just like in dragon ball fighter
Literally just Dragon Ball FighterZ for Marvel characters… Take my money
This is how marvel vs Capcom should be done!
Arc isn't known for alt costumes so that'll be a bit weird but like the gurren lagann, my hero, ultra man designs are kinda  cool.
I’ll play this on mute
I am a fan of Marvel, but this is EPIIIIIIIIIIIIICCCC!!!!!!!!!!!🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
What I would like to see in this game, so that it doesn't become so similar to its predecessors:  X-Men: Kitty Pryde, Nightcrawler, X-23, Hope Summers, Quicksilver   Avengers: Moon Knight, Black Panther, Scarlet Witch Fantastic Four: Ben Grimm, Johnny Storm, Sue Storm, Reed Richards Villains: Super-Skrull, Dr. Octopus, Electro, Mysterio Hell's Kitchen: Elektra, Bullseye  Others: Ikaris, Thena, Nova, Magik, Hyperion, Dr. Spectrum
Marvel in gibberish slanty language.
The intro music man
ARC SYS??? MARVEL?? YESSSSSS
Y'all should put spider-man into the spider-verse back into fortnite
Marvel fighter Z !
It reminds a bit of dragon ball z fighters
2:06 " VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER! RAAAGGHHH"!
Nice
I want this game!
Yes
Make it free to play if you want the game to succeed
Capcom punching air rn
Looks cool but more like gulty gear marvel so i don't see much new mechanics
espero que tenha dublagem brasileira
Venom please!!
Too bad this isn’t mortal kombat supported bcuz this game looks whack
We got Spider-man speaking Japanese before GTA VI
YES
A copy of dbfz
Please have English dub for this game
Dear Marvel open up your library of characters and use other characters for the love of GOD stop using the same MCU mainstream characters over and over you have a ton of characters that will drive up your sales and interest as well.  Someone will go oh wow who is this character and it draws buzz.  Market all of Marvel and not the same stuff this may alleviate some of the fatigue as well you don't do anything new.  One character that can go well in this game is Sebastian Shaw.
Ghost rider is a Diavolo from JoJo?
Please god if Taskmaster gets in, give me a chance
EVERYONE REMEMBER .......
spoida-mon
Can we get a standing ovation ...........YES
just awaiting ryu and batman and other guest characters
I wish SNK can why cant SNK be more like this?
Me: You know in Anime when a guy gets launched back because his nose is gushing blood or whatever...?
2xko
Al fin un juego decente de Marvel
Really awesome, it does remind me of xko of riot though.
Thank you Japan
Marvel con voces Otaku 🗿🚬
2:22 no ps4? 💔 it might be time to switch
1:13 Ghost Rider saying "let me introduce you to an East LA special" is way too cool!!!!!! it get hype every time i hear it. The Japanese voices area chef's kiss!
4 on 4 battles, 18 characters at launch. 😅
外国用でも闘魂なん？
nice!!!!!!
Marvel vs Capcom and FighterZ fans on suicide watch
CAPTAIN AMERICA IS VOICED BY GOJO I REPEAT CAPTAIN AMERICA IS VOICED BY GOJO
30 years later we finally get the sequel to marvel super heroes!!!
Thank you Asian Devs for making better Marvel games than our Western devs.
from Arc System Works of course
RIP Marvel vs Capcom 🪦
AL FIN DEJAN QUE LA MARCA LO TRABAJE GENTE QUE SI TIENE TALENTO
ghost rider is bakugo
Marvel vs Capcom without Capcom
Hard! Now all we need is Killer Instinct 2
looks cool.
😮😮😢😢😊😊❤❤!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If this doesn't arrive to NS2, its going to be an insult.
Now all we need is Marvel vs DC.  But I will take this!!
Marvel is cooking with this characters design!!! 🔥🔥🔥
I'm predicting right now, every character shown is already a member of 4 individuals. Dr. Doom (johnny, the thing and reed) captain america (bucky, black widow and black panther) iron man (hawkguy, Dr. Strange, hulk) spiderman (miles, doc ock, venom) storm (wolverine, cyclops, magneto) starlord (drax, rocket, groot or warlock) ghost raider (blade, deadpool, idk who's the other one)
1:54 Close enough, welcome back FOOT DIVE.  I am so ready to be bad at this game.
Instant buy, my first marvel game was mvc2, my favorite was mvc3 and now marvel rivals and this game soooo much fun
THIS LOOKS AWESOME. Excited. Japanese DEVS have really good ideas. The ART thought is literally eyegasm
I don’t care if this is a Japanese game. Them speaking Japanese is the most weeby thing ever.
maybe, with less flashes, i would be able to appreciate the moves
SPAIDAMA 0:45!!!
10
Lame
I see they have Starlord's super running on Dante's template for now
Bah
IT’S MAHVEL BABY!!!
Marvel fiighter z
Another game DSP will cry over
So cool！
Always loved MvC series but they're in good hands with Arc System Works
When I see this I all most passed out....
Arc just eatin Capcom's lunch
1:54 strategist mains must have loved this sequence😭
is quicksilver gonna be in it
is quicksilver gonna be in it
I'm in love. 🤩
The roster depth is going to be crazy. Arc System Works know how to make generational games.
2026 yall gon release a trailer 1y
Marvel + PS5 = Garbage.
The fact they were able to keep this a secret is amazing.
Cadê o Hulk?
THIS IS GORGEOUS
I'm getting Dragon Ball FighterZ vibes
I wanted innovation not copy/paste 🤦🏻‍♂️
Ms. Marvel is such a sub par character, but Arc makes her look insanely cool and useful. She might be my main:-)
Ahora a esperarlo en PC. Buen juego. Ya hacia falta algo mas de pelea de marvel.
They're back!😁
We got Ryu as Captain America 😭
Marvel vs capcom 5
they got me at "arc system works" !!!
They really took the MVC Infinite vs. DB FighterZ comparisons to heart a few years ago in the best way. Super excited for this!
They turned Iron Man into a Gundam😅
Okay is it just me or did Starlord just use Deadpool/Dante's special for MVC?
Dante was such an amazing character they had to split his moveset between Starlord and Ghost Rider. Reminds me of how Soul Calibur 2 Nightmare's moves got split between Soul Calibur 3's Siegfried and Nightmare. Although this time, I won't have to make a choice between characters, I'll just put each half of Dante on the same team!
Eu quero
I'm hoping they give Original Costumes   for the Characters 🤞🏻
Loving this
Yyyyeah LFG
yeah nah Marvel Rivals is still better
Arc + Marvel what could go right 🎉
Everybody’s been talking about the gameplay, and the art style, and the animation, and the character choices, all of which are amazing, but I also want to shout out the music. I really hope this song gets released just as a song soon.
Pastel looking Fortnite animation. I’ll pass on this slop
Sonicfox finna go crazy at this game WATCH!! lol
Is it just me or does this game look exactly like Dragon Ball FighterZ?
Marvel games making good decisions choosing devs outside the west, or it'd be doomed
is this street fighter injustice lol
Is it free?
Ok let Japan make everything
This will be like every other fighting, street fighter,mortal kombat, dbz etc be all cool and fun by a month after release I'll lose all that hype and Game will become stail
Never thought we'd see an actually good captain america design again
How will this affect the legacy of Melty Blood
fire
It won't be long till we see fanart of Storm's design hitting the google's image section
Marvel Rivals, Doomsday on the horizon, and now this? We are so back!
They done made Iron Man a Gundam
It's sad seeing this but it looks good IMHO capcom should of ditched the 3d for this 2d
yes, yes, oh and.... YES~!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Coolest game I seen this year
This was a unexpected surprise no one asked for. Basically another marvel super heroes from capcom
STORM...!
storm <3
FOOD DIVE , FOOD DIVE FOFOFOFOOD DIVEEEE!!!
gotta make this ish free, it will explode
Give us GAMBIT and our soul is yours! 😃
Doom is aura farming
Marvel Superheroes with Japanese  voice actors!?  Never have I needed something so much and never known it til I recieved it.
I'm in love with Ms Marvel
Day one

Mid
A la primera que me sacan el final justicw ae pudre todo9
スターロード、MCUとも演技違っててさすが山ちゃんって感じ
No se les cae 1 idea a los locos
Yeah I'm not listening to marvel characters in Japanese.  Some lines you just don't cross.  Gameplay looks nice though
Too bad it's for Playstation.
No one can claim Arc Sys isn’t always pushing the envelope. 4v4 looks insane in the best way possible
YES YES YES YES YES!!!!
Happy Ghost Rider is getting some recognition but man wanted the Blaze version.
That. Looks. So. Sick.
Fighterz copy paste
Tōkon vs FighterZ. Just saying...
injustice is BETTER
やっぱりカプコンってセンスあるんだな。 カプコン製のMARVEL SUPER HEROESの方が動きが良い。
Is this gonna be in american?
AMAZING GRAPHICS
Literally just DBFZ but Marvel 😊
Prx Th grands, the battle for second place
Please tell me they're not going to be speaking Japanese 🙄
Marvel's japanese mortal Kombat  And I like it 👍
SPIDEYYYY SENSE
Cool but, we need Marvrl to focus on the games they have, not more Marvel games.
This looks like dragon ball fighter z😂😂😂
Fun fact, the vs series started out as just marvel (X-men). The great reset? When’s it coming to PC?  I’m done with Sony.
They will definitely make "Supaidaman" mods for this game's Spider-Man
Please. Please please please do a VS. Capcom
BAN STORM AND MAGNETO and GAMBIT, BROKEN HEROES!
Take my money now!!!!
Guilty Gear : Marvel Universe...
0:47 insane
How come ArySys always is the best on 3D animation and game development
so if it’s 4v4 the roster is going to be massive, right?
Marvel Fighterz. Interesting
I wonder how the controls going to be
Sony gatekeeping yet again
Man I hope we get some weird roster picks akin to Modok in MvC3, the amount of interesting characters for a fighting game in marvel is endless!
marvel  vs capcom 3 vibes
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🫡🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is so cool!! Great job Marvel!!
We need this to colaborate with Rivals and share each game skins
Where is Ryu? Where is Megaman? What is this ? 😢😭
Marvel Z Fighters
Where's deadpool
That’s the ugliest cap costume I’ve ever seen 😂🤢
Dragon balll fighter Z from Marvel 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Dang I was looking for a game to really instill in me that I’m bad at juggling in tag team fighters
Marvel vs Capcom but no one from capcom felt like showing up to the fight
This has to have a huge base roster 🤞
If it wasn’t saying PlayStation i was thinking this a mobile game
What could possibly take fighting game of the year away from this it's going to be legendary
This just look like Strive….
So I see Marvel DBZ fighters
Easter Eggs:  Dazzler in the marquis Daredevil: Fogwell's Gym and N/M Scales Damage Control  Green Tentacles on the NM building, ?Shuma Gorath
Closest thing to dragon ball fighterz 2 were gonna get.
Marvel will just not give up on this Marvel Girl no matter many times the audience reject her. It's admirable until you remember how many other characters they cast aside that people actually want.
Please give me psylock
I DIED CRIED WAS RESURRECTED THEN DIED AGAIN IN THAN ORDER
gonna take you for a rideeeeee
Guilty Marvel in the Strive-Verse
Well… time to shell out money for an endless amount of dlc and season passes. Then one patch/update kills the community leaving behind yet another p.o.s game. This keeps happening 😂
Looks like its not the real japanese spider-man because hes not using his robot
Arc VS Marvel approaching in the horizon...
Esse será jogão!
2XKO is absolutely cooked
just make a marvel vs capcom game right for fcks sake you were so close
It's so cool! I want this game!
Cool new marvel fighting games   Not seeing xbox platform💀
SAWASHIRO MIYUKI AS STORM??? THAT'S IT, YOU GOT ME 🔥🔥🔥
Granblue Fantasy Versus but in Marvel modus
It looks amazing. I can't wait to play it
The hulk gonna be insane
What kind of mod from Dragon Ball FighterZ is this?
Dragon Ball MarvelZ
i know its unlikely since the rights for him are still a complicated topic but i hope they bring shuma gorath to this game he was so fun in mvc
And I'll have no life for the first season of the game😤
Add a twerk emote to storm
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, GIVE US FIGHTERZ 2 PLEAAAAAASE
Maruveru vs Maruveru
Now you have my attention Marvel.
yes. Yes. YES. YES!!!!
闘魂！
Love how Doom's power move is pulling out the switch. I also wish this was being released for Xbox
DC fans:  "pffft whatever. We got a new Superman movie"
Street fighter style niceee!!!!
4vs4 is revolutionary
i love how Dr. Doom is the most powerful guy but still pulls out a Gat 1:25
DB fighterz but with marvel? Im a happy camper
Capitan Japanese
Japan is showing more love and respect for American comic book heroes than America.
I love this game already
MVC5 will come made by Arcsys 6 or 7 years after MTFS. Hear me out. IF you don't wanna read the full thing, just read the tldr para. tldr Arcsys is actually working towards MVC5 but creating 60 characters with this level of detail is insanely hard and time consuming and would take 12-14 years. They start with Marvel side roster of MVC5 and upon finishing it release it as MTFS. Soon as MTFS releases, Arcsys work's on Capcom side. Takes around 6 more years, removes 6 bad less popular legacy Marvel chars and replace with new ones. They have to make 36 new chars in those 6 years. Then release it as MVC5. Capcom could already be on board. That's the only way to explain Marvel and Capcom's good relationship right now to me.  Arcsys has taken Eighting's place. It is the new Eighting that develops better visuals for IPs like Marvel, Dragonball. Long term plan is to make MVC5 with Capcom on board but like MSH and X-Men:COTA, first game is going to be Marvel only? Why, because its insanely hard to create characters with those level of visual detail. They are selling 2 games by working towards 1 roster which will be at the end of MVC5. Here's the order of things that I think will happen. (1) Arcsys releases MTFS and goes up to 32 chars at the game's end and life cycle. (2) As soon as MTFS releases, Arcsys starts work on MVC5 mostly on Capcom characters. (3) When making MVC5, Arcsys makes a total roster of 60 characters. This will include 30 on Capcom side, 26 from MTFS and 6 New Marvel characters. 6 less popular legacy will probably be cut. This makes the total brand new characters they have to work on 36. (4) MVC5 becomes 5v5 which is very close to the popular Captain America: Civil War movie's 6v6. (5) Important point you have to realize is that Capcom did not make UMVC3 either... the last successful MVC. They had Eighting develop it. Arcsys, emphasizing again here makes Team fighters for other popular IPs like DB, Marvel... this time they add Capcom to the mix with Marvel. (6) For all we know, Capcom maybe is already on board with the entire 12 year plan... which I'd say started 5 years ago. 1 year later (total 6 years) MTFS, the successor to MSH releases. 6 years after that MVC5 releases. ^Maybe all this is Copium but the thing is... its the only way it makes sense to me that Marvel and Capcom are on such good terms but Arcsys is making the fighting game. The cost for such high visuals is insane. Arcsys can't make huge rosters and this seems to be the only solution. If Arcsys were to make a MVC5 with a roster of 60, the above that I mentioned seems like the only feasible way to earn enough to justify the cost & investment... which is go towards a roster of 60 but while making 2 games and earning off the 2 games. I don't think Capcom is simultaneously gonna release a MVC5 on their own. They know that can't make an artstyle as good as Arcsys and they would not want a repeat of the MVCI Vs. DBFZ lose lose situation. Given however, how Marvel has recently respected and praised Capcom and the legacy of MVC series, I think the respect will go beyond just the collections. Just look at X-Men 97, its littered with MVC2 references, all of which were Capcom made. Everyone is like "Marvel Vs. Capcom is cooked." I'm like no... "Marvel Vs. Capcom is cooking up in Arcsys's Oven." wait for it 6 years after MTFS.
Omg there is now a marvel zfighters❤😂🎉
Give me this game now!!!!!!!!!!
Nice job. Now i'm waiting for the english dub
Almost looks like marvel vs capcom
Game looks great but I still don't understand why you guys are trying to force the industry plant Ms. Marvel on us when nobody really likes her lol. Carol Danvers definitely would have been a better choice if it had to be a Ms. Marvel.
Marvel Divorcing Capcom
0:26 Literally a gundam. Also should have spiderman be voiced by the spiderman from hell  Also should have made Marvel ask for the game to be made not Sony
Only one villain no Venom zzzzz
Reminds me of FighterZ so that’s cool
Could this be a hint to maybe another marvel vs Capcom in 2027?!
Goku in the game files keeping everything together
I wish storm and spidey fought like this in rivals 😂😂
日米共同グランプリを開催して盛り上げて欲しいなぁ…。日本人とアメリカ人が一つになって高みを目指す良い機会になると思う。
I dont recall marvel being in Japanese, but maybe thats just me.
その内、カプコンやバンダイも参加するのかなぁ…。
This gives me MVC, KOF, cel shader and Shonen anime vibes ❤❤❤❤
Moonknight NEEDS to be in this game
marvel z fighters
It’s Asian marvel !!
1:24 de todas maneras nos muestra al doctor doom y como podria ser su traje o accesorios para la pelicula doomsday =)
nothing new here. bye
This design of ghost rider is fire, gives me Fire Force vibes!!!
ARC system works cook.
This... looks... beautiful 🫶
I guess this means no Marvel Vs. Capcom 4. :(
0:42 -> Says CROSSOVER  -> It's not a crossover (unlike MvC)
I'm hoping they have canon 4-men teams in the game like:  X-Men: Storm, Cyclops, Wolverine and Beast  Avengers: Cap, Ironman, Thor, Hulk  GOTG: Star Lord, Rocket, Groot, Gamora  Etc.
Wow so cool, no Deadpool once again
We can all thank Sony PlayStation for bringing this into existence.
0:33 Only i hear "king..." That how diavolo saying thst
No Xbox no switch 2….. bag sold
AWESOME!!!!
When this will be release?
At this point Marvel should also outsource their comic making division to the East seeing how much of a failure they already proven themselves.
I wonder how Capcom feel about this.
Marvel fighter Z!!
Just get Cyclops in this thing
Another banger for marvel keep it up 🔥
I thought Captain America was a black dude
2:11 believe me this is round intro or loading scene.
The Storm renaissance has been lovely. They are finally giving her back the spotlight she had in the 80s/90s
No Magneto! No Wolverine! 😤
Wow, this looks awesome.
I know a lot of people love these type of games but man. Big skip for me.
Storm is so cool
나이롱맨 뿔 ㄹㅇ ㅈ같네
Even the Trees are DEI in this. As if Marvel characters now speaking japanese wasnt enough.
Deadpoll or venom please?? DEADPOOL OR VENOM PLEASE 😭😭😭
Such a terrible Iron Man design!
1:19 No, I don't think I am, Doom. In fact, NO ONE WAS READY FOR THIS!
Looks cool but wow that's crazy 4v4  ut if MK did that people would be mad just like they doing with MK1🤦🏾‍♂️
ありがとうございます。すごく楽しそう！ DLCでSaint Seiyaか入れてください！😭こちら様なんでも上手にするからさ！
please god make this game free, please god make this game free, please god make this game free, please god make this game free, please god make this game free, PLEEEEAAAASE GOD MAKE THIS GAME FREE
please god make this game free or extremely cheap and prioritize selling skins and stages and music and taunts at a low non predatory price 1:15 . yall will have a player base of a million returning players buying everything that drops in the game this game could be the biggest game of all time with that model. CHANGE THE GAME
Love the Ironman suit
This is literally Z Fighters but Marvel
This is so fire!
Captain japan
I'm sad they didn't show any wolverine or hulk in this...
いくら有名な声優使っても日本語だせぇ…マブカプみたいにマーベルサイドは英語がいいかな
This looks amazing! Time for a capcom vs capcom!
Nahhhh it's a dragon ball fighter mood
Venom? Ultron perhaps????   If these two are in my money is yours
Marvel fightrZ
Looks like announced 2XKO
This looks so awesome. Instabuy.
Please a Xbox Release
I understood absolutely nothing but still liked it. This games looks 🔥🔥🔥
This is awesome
BUCK UP, SOLDIER!
I just want one thing. Shadowcat and Lockheed to be one character. Make her a sword fighter too
looks exactly like 2XKO from riot xD
gundam iron man 🙏🙏
Very well done, appreciate this video!
I wouldvw prefered fighterz 2, but this in cool too
Yes. Don't need to explain further
Mahvel!
They need to upload the soundtrack to this trailer, it definitely slaps
I'm not quite sure why it's with japanese VAs but this looks cool
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
Moon Knight & Daredevil please
Marvel vs Capcom vibes 😍
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
Roster bouta go crazy!
Still gets me the fact that we got a Marvel FighterZ and not a single ONE PIECE one. Crazy
How is this not on Xbox too smh
For Android?
O  GAMES  ESTÁ  LINDO !!!! AO MELHOR ESTILO ARCADE !!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Marvel Figtherz
Guilty gear 3v3 is experiment for this
Xbox séries? Vou jogar steam 😊
where is capcom
Ppl we want copcom cross over ❤❤
finally got a game like mortal kombat
Marvel vs Marvel 2099
New Dragon Ball FitersZ, а если честно, смотрю и вижу Guilty Gear вместе с Dragon Ball FitersZ какая-то фигня, лучше пойти поиграть в Dragon Ball FitersZ чем в эту жалкую пародию
Dragon Ball Fighterz x Happy Color
Looks fun
This would be perfect on Switch 2
No more MvC😢
They really milking marvel ip every last drop.
Colour me intrigued. I'm curious to see the entire roster.
Yeah that's a banger.
Can we have Spawn?
great, but of course there are English voices, right?
Literally Marvel Fighter Z
MARVEL BE MAKING BANNGER GAMES CASUALLY AS SIDE JOB
"SPIDEEEY SENSE" Arigatou Marvulo Studios !
Look at the character designs, they've definitely taken inspiration from Marvel Rivald after seeing its success
MarvelFighterZ
Finally, Ms. Marvel is a loli again.
Ok don’t care
ARC SYSTEM???? WE ARE SO BACK
Can we get Marvel vs. Capcom 4?
If marvel are really gonna have a FOUR vs FOUR fighting game I thing the fantastic FOUR would be a great team comp to run Would y’all think
It's like Marvel erased the Capcom part of the title. 😄
fiesta i thought was a soulslike...but it's another fighting game...Marvel Vs Capcom is back under another skin...what a shame...
There's something cringe about voicing in Japanese just for the style because your own language would sound lame
SPIDERMAN？！？！
where is ma wolverine????!!!!
Wow arc system. The one who made dragon ball fighter z
This just seems like fighterz lol. Looks sick tho
I def know at the min 3/4 of the VA’s from anime alone, and as a huge marvel nerd, I am ALL HERE FOR IT!!!!
take my money!!! TQ
When's Marvel???? 2026 i guess......
Ohh great another fighting game, cause we don't have enough of those. Remember when Marvel used to make story driven games. I guess Capcom didn't want to work with them this time
Why do the Asians do marvel so much better 😭😭😭😭
Is this going to be peak?
Marvel decided to start cooking with games. This looks amazing!
Reminds me of when marvel characters used to be street fighters
Marvel in the vein of THE KING OF FIGHTERS 99-2001
if u are making fighting game for PS5 make it like TEKKEN 8  this game graphic and gameplay looks like PS2 street fighter game
This is our time. Gaming is becoming good again!
FighterZ vibe right here
oh boy here we go again, another Marvel game that the fanboys will hype up to no end as the greatest thing ever made.... then it'll fade away once the release hype wears down, just like Rivals. The fanboys will ignore reality and facts like tag fighters being a niche in the already niche genre that is FGs, so causals will drop it and even hardcore FGC will not keep with the game, and the there's a reason Arc Systems games are not that popular in the FGC other than for the visuals.
Why is it Japanese though?
This game looks promising but no one isn’t checking for Ms Marvel
Just remake marvel vs capcom again
I'm dreaming of the wolverine reveal
Se ve bueno aun no hay un juego de pelea que supere el Marvel vs Capcom 3
Doom speaking Japanese is too epic 😂
0:07 IT’S A GUNDAAAAMMM
What is that gundam Ironman suit.  4 V 4 !?!? 🤯
Wherever he is, Stan lee says "don't put my name on this"
This feels like a parody of a parody
Marvel ous!
The one character pass I WILL BUY DAY ONE
Awesome video
OMG STAR LORD LOOKS AMAZING
This is a great move for both Playstation & Marvel
Marvel got a good thing going with the gaming world, dont ruin this like Disney ruined it all
fighting games these last year have not lived long mk1,tekken ,sf6(better then other 2) i wonder how this will go
This doesn’t hold a candle to what we had I can already tell
Arc System Works got that animation down in two distinct styles now, unbelievable.
The game catches my attention, but I don't like the designs. Iron Man's is literally a human-sized Gundam replica.  Its a japanese game, after all.
Looks insanely cool
All you had to put is Wolverine & Deadpool but marvel is so stuck with the avengers that they lack thinking out of box
Dragon Fighter Z
SUPAIDAMAN.
日本語だと!?
Buff men, hot women, take my money asian devs!
looks and sounds amazing
マーカプより画面が明るくて見やすい。
There’s nothing more I hate than a side by side fighting game. I mean I seriously hate this type of games.
If DOOM doesn't FOOT DIVE we riot
dafuq is that ellastigirl?
4v4 !! my little brain can't handle that much😅
when are you guys gonna understand we want a smash bros style game like this and not another marvel vs capcom/street fighter/tekken/ KoF/blazeblue
Starlord’s moveset = Dante’s weasel shot from UMVC3
Guys we have got yet another candidate who wants to compete with Dragon Ball Fighterz, well let's see how this turns out.
I love the graphics, finally were getting the right animation for a capcom fighting game
It's like Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm series
Is there a English voice option?
Cool, where is the english trailer.?
You can just tell this is made by Arc System by the way it looks like Guilty Gear and Fighterz. I’m so excited.
PC version?
Looks like a copy of Marvel Contest of Champions
This is what Marvel vs Capcom fans wanted for so long but they didn't even put Capcom in this. SO CLOSE YET SO FAR......
I'm glad they finally realized that their games should stopn mimicking the movies and stick to mimicking the comics: vibrant and bombastic rather than subdued and realistic.
Awesome
😢cool
This is 🔥  Love Marvel
I don’t think I’ve rewatched a game trailer so much in my life. It’s that epic tone shift in music when Doom comes on & Storm takes over. Lawd have mercy this is going to be so fun to play
Crazy how things change the rest of the world is doing it better than certain folks. 😂
wow iron man is gundam
DLC: vs CAPCOM....COMING SOON FOR $99 😂
Dragon Ball Fighters Clone?
見た感じほぼマブカプ マーベルスーパーヒーローズをマブカプに落とし込みました　かな 率直な感想は「カプコンじゃないんだ」 とはいえ面白そうではある
the name of the game is horrendous
what a wate of a great IP. Heroes save the world not fight each other in a stupid tournament.
Ok I guess I’ll start another  “ Character wishlist” comment here …..  Hmmm let’s see …. Scarlet Witch !!! .. oh and Omega Red!
0:13 "We're friends. Why do we keep doing this?" The mystery of every fighting game cast.
Marvel 4, or Marvel: Tōkon Fighting Souls... some say it's called this because it Took On the Fighting Souls of both MVC and DBFZ.
FighterZ 2
It’s maaaaaahvel baby 🎉
Add MadCap and you have my life
Fire
I thought this was capcom😭
all those characters and we can't even get the real ghost rider
I reallly hope Arcsys don’t repeat the BBTAG mistakes with this game
CAPCOM？？？？
오호.. 오랜만에 대전격겜이라니..ㅜㅡㅜ 마대캡의 부활이다!! 스위치2로도 나와주라~~~~
Wait....how can Iron Man and Doctor Doom be in same place at the SAME TIME??? Something fishy there 😂
Iiiiiits MAHVEL BABY!
miss marvel not looking like a goblin may help her popularity 😂
So FigtherZ but with marvel heroes.
Somewhere a Capcom executive is cutting off his own pinky
WE ARE SO BACK
Is there an english version, coz I dunno why but listening to this makes me feel like I am watching.....something else....
Game looks like garbage
So hyped!!
Patched Street Fighter 😅
I was waiting to see ryu or batsu but no just marvel… what a loss
Marvale studios.
I hope it will have a story mode with chats genes and a English version too
There’s gonna be English translation on release I assume?
The east is showing more respect for our stuff than we could ever do with their stuff
FighterZ but marvel
I wonder how much it'll take for the Mugen community to make these chars into the engine
They have to perfect opportunity to include the tokusatsu Spider-Man as a skin for Spidey.
Kind of nice that they are using the Robbie Reyes Ghost Rider.
YES, ARC SYSTEM WORKS, YES!!!
Dr Doom!?  Sold!
The style and character design is so good, this gives me Boku no hero vibes.
MvC5 never
fighterz is that.. is that you
Basically a Game for mashers 😂
🔥🔥
sold
Как гилтси гир)
TAKE MY MONEY NOW!!!!!
Guilty gear Marvel lol btw what the heck with  that gundaman 😂
RIOT should feel ashamed.
close enough welcome fighterz 2
How is this different from the other Marvel fighting games? I just fail to see the difference.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
slop
Storm being the strongest is accurate 😂
Marvel tekken alright
Love that Kamala Khan is in the base roster. But I’m a lot more surprised at Robbie Reyes’ Ghost Rider is in it, plus a tease about Daredevil in one of the stages.
The amazing suuuuupidah-man
It’s not on Xbox😭😭😭
As always, thanks Japan. The U.S. shouldn't have dropped bombs.
porque no va a llegar a xbox series x nintendo switch 2
Not bad not bad at all
supaidaman memes in coming.
I hope luke cage and black panther make it into this game.
Spiddddeeeyyyy SENSUU
Mazginf 😂🎉❤
Oh my god bro
TAKE MY MONEY😂
Looks like Dragon Ball fighterZ
Spida...SENSE😳
Marvel vs Capcom 5❌ Marvel vs Marvel✅
Por favor, me diz que vai ter um modo história junto dessa belezura de jogo 🙏 ❤
Nope
Geez they used spidey as a punching bag! They knew that would be cathartic for rival players
I see Disney taking notes with Marvel Rivals which is, don’t let Marvel games be made in the west.
this is nice!@!!
First DLC Crossover: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
So marvel vs. capcom…… without the capcom? Still looks kinda cool but idk gotta see what all characters are in here
Hopefully we get more than 2 girl characters but for  what it is the roster is pretty good.
The legion of Doombots gets me hyped.
Good GGST reskin, have to play
スパイディー… セーンス！！
¿And Bucky?
Uff this looks so good already! It just needs a good amount of characters
Marvel Nemesis 2
I hope we see more than 8 heros also japan mess up Doom with Red Skull because the last one would totally have A GLOCK as a superpower but Dr Doom is more like summon a giant portal with a nuke i would say xDD
That art is sick
The JP seiyuus are  perfection for my ears.
I love marvel but first we didn't get to have marvel rivals, now another marvel game. Please have mercy for PS4 brokies 🤧🤧🤧
AWESOMEEEEE!!!!!!
🔥
What’s next ? Capcom vs Kellogs?
Ummm...sure
best marvel game
maaan it looks so awesome!!!
Get some capcom guest characters
🔥
Spyda man
oh my god
PEAKK.
Let have the Punisher, Daredevil and luke Cage in this.
ArcSyc is unstoppable
I don't think I'm going to get it.   Makes good content for a YouTubeer though.
I hope they put venom carnage daredevil and the punisher
I just hope health isnt  3 hits and die......more like dragon ball fighterz would do....and no X Factor
Please I hope they add in all the XMEN Especially Cyclops
AWESOME!!!!
They finally made me, myself , and marvel. but don't tell the legal team they ripped off Capcom 😅
This is just dragon ball fighterz with marvel characters
Doctor doom teleported then pulled out the tool 😂
1:55 Foot Dive
Is this MarvelBall fighterZ
Doom pulling out the Blicky in a Fur coat is Peak New York Aura. I might cop this and I ain’t even got a PS5.
Marvel with Arc System Works!!!
Damnit not on Xbox...  Home Black Panther and my soul is yours!
1:55 If we don't see more, THIS will be the closest thing to Doctor Doom's "FOOT DIVE" in this game
Marvel dominating in movies and video games. Catch up DC.
You better have The Emissary of Hell, Supaida-Man in it!
Visuals are epic, but why the weird undubbed voices? I used to think Capcom was lazy in Street Fighter with non existent lipsync, but this is next level bad for Marvel fans.
The factz that ArcSys made this game the ones who made my favorite fighting game in recent years DBFZ omg this is gonna be gooooooood!!!!  Cant wait to see you out there FighterZ lol😊
Ultimate Marvel VS Marvel
necesitan muchos más personajes si lo quieren hacer de 4 vs 4
Imagine, Marvel vs SegaSammy!!! Fingers crossed bro!
Insanely absolutely insane
It doesn't work without Capcom.
Ms Marvel is so perfect for a fighting game with her squash and stretch
90$.
I never feel I need gundam looking ironman until I see one
DEI Marvel Super Heroes
now with capcom characters!!
Yes, this is what matters
This game is gonna be awesome! I hope it has instant kills. Also, they better give Tony Stark a Gundam color scheme as an alt palette.
I gotta train me 1st😂😂..but sure..you ALREADY KNOW im gonna be on this😎
Can’t wait to see more rule 34 Emma frost, sue storm, and dagger art for next century
Se ve mucho mejor que Marvel rival
Same people who make guilty gears ?
Marvel vs Capcom 5?
뭐고이거 마블 대 캡콤을 길티기어 화풍으로 만든거잖아...
Why is that derivative trash character on the roster?
The game looks lit ! I'd say Iron Man doesn't really feel like Iron man tho i hope he'll have good alternate costumes
Another assist spamming fighting game
Did they actually change marvel vs capcom😢
Can't wait for Lythero to stream this once it's out!
1:41 " *Japanese Lingo*, Yo Mama" - Storm
Ngl keep it we want marvel vs capcom 4 and open player Batman Arkham like games
Dragonball Fighter Z DLC is looking great
Imagine how epic the ironman suit would be if Tony Stark survived and incorporated vibranium nanobots into his tech.
Take my moneyyyy
HOLY CRAP MARVEL'S STREET FIGHTER 6
Actually looks good.   Between this, Rivals, and Snap marvel games are cooking
It's about time!!!
Someone please tell me the god created this boom of an soundtrack
worse than DC comica fighting game and worst than most street fighter games and revamps
too basic similarly looking effects that dont interact well against the reactions of the other player character
Dragon Ball Fighterz but if it wasn’t unbalanced as hell?! Ayo this is peak.
0:57 Dante mains: "I've seen this before..."
I just hope it’s not an auto fighter, the game looks great but I’d hate for it to feel like a mash fest on the casual side of things
I’m pretty hype for this
ok, this is insane.
Ghost rider yes
Yes, I'm ready for F-F-F-F-F-FOOT DIVE into super
character roster meh... the muslim girl, the guardias of the galaxy guy... really?
I’m obsessed already
STORMMMMM 😩😩😩
Pero bien KLK
Made by Ark Sys....SOLD
Game Copy Dragon Ball fighter Z
But where's all the Street Fighter characters? 🥲
I hope Carnage makes the roster!
MARVELS FIGHTERZ Z 😍😍😍😮‍💨  Take it all 🤩💰🫲🏽
MARVELS FIGHTERZ Z 😍😍😍😮‍💨  Take it all 🤩💰🫲🏽
Next is Marvel vs Arc.
thousands of people have already mastered this game
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
Iron Man+Mobile Suit Gundam is peak
this just dbz fighterz but marvel
Fans: What's the roster gonna look like? ASW: Yes.
amazing
The designs are cool but the visuals, graphics, art style (?) it’s perfect!! I could play Marvel vs Capcom or X-Men vs Street Fighter with these visuals for an eternity! Also please please please more playable X-Men, please!!
WOW, EPIC
Marvel vs. Guilty Gear?
Marvel fighterz
Thank God its not marvel vs capcom that serious is terrible this was a way better choice its going to be amazing
I cannot overstate how AWFUL I am at tag-team fighting games but I always enjoy watching other people that are actually GOOD at them play.
If this goes US dub, hopefully RDJ could lend his voice for Iron Man and Dr. Doom.
yayyy
What's Tokon?? And why didn't they do Capcom as well, I Guess we've had those Characters already. But Dante and the other Capcom players were dope asf
Arc Sys eating all of Capcom's lunch.
not a single negative comment......
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
GOOD!! ❤
Unexpected but very welcome!
Storm is 👌👌👌👌👌👌
Marvel VS Capcom, without Capcom.
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
2026 is gonna be insane with games
Tony better yell "SUPERIOR TECH"
Japanese style
This was super helpful, thanks!
XBOX?
Guilty Gear vs Marvel??????
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Its marvel vs Capcom 3 with a new coat of paint!! Why did it take so long to do this!! Instead of "insert failed marvel fighting game here"
When's mahvel?
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
Why why Ms Marvel?!! She sucks. What a waste of space in lineup, should have used scarlet witch, psylocke, invisible woman, white queen, hell I would have taken captain marvel over her
It's Marvel baby!
Iron man having a gundam like v-fin is sooo cool
is it ONLY 8 characters in total or are there some they haven't revealed yet?
I need someone to reply to this comment when the open testing comes out, if there is any 🫡
My GOD… they made a MAHVEL vs MAHVEL… 😮
That iron man design is peak
Marvel Z Fighters
Ok you got my attention 😮😮😮
Street Marvel of fighterZ
So marvel  decided "you know what we here everyone and we'll  do it ourselves"
It's Marvel Super Heroes 2.
🚨🛑I like-ity this game-atata🛑🚨
Why no one talking about Storm's VA being ma boi Kurapika??! 😭😭
Star Lord saying "YEAH BABY" is the most on brand thing ever and I love it.
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
Ay no en serio los mismos personajes de siempre 🙄🙄🙄y marvel tiene muchos personajes por explotar y siempre ponen los mismos ay no vuélvanse serios
this is literally just Dragonball FighterZ but Marvel and I'm SO DOWN FOR IT
Why are they talking japaneese
At 0:38 marvel rivals didn’t do ms marvel first but this game did
So this is basically Street Fighter with MK1 Kameos and Injustice 2 map switches, kewl...
Metieron a personajes que a nadie lw importa como a la chica marvel pero no me toerón a Jean Grey.
They better have a Supaidaman alternate costume at launch!
As awesome as this looks, it could become another Marvel Vs Capcom Infinite.
A platform fighter would’ve been so nice
can we do carnage instead of venom, gwenpool would be cool too.
Looks awesome!!
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
Somehow, Marvel characters speaking Japanese is way better.
PLEASE CROSSPLAY
Marvel Vs Capcom had better designs tbh, but well, it doesn't looks weird at all
My dream has come true. 4 vs 4
GIVE US SNK VS CAPCOM, YOU COWARDS!!
Loved the content, keep it coming!
I am praying they give spiderman the mech he had in the japanese show
For Xbox? 😢😢😢😢😢 Plissss
FINALLY STAGE TRANSITIONS!
Wait wait, ark systems?! This is gonna be awesome. and it's going to be full of DLC.
they japanified the marvel characters and it looks beautiful
The marvel vs Capcom we wanted years ago
Storm Va is Miyuki Sawahiro ?
Actually… 4on4 ARC MARVEL IS LIKE a 6 year old idea of mine maybe even 7… went hand in hand with the GUILTY GEAR STRIVE TAG ASK still unexplored INFINITE X STRIVE I did controls as a simple BUMPER TRIGGER both as you just open up more options on less than… cycle concept POWER RANGERS
Esta storm si se puede ver :v
Doom stole Slayer's dash and voice actor  Based
Ojalá también salga wolwerine Carnage ms Marvel de 1994 red skull   los 4 fantástico simbiote screem y absolute Carnage tiene alas y se ve muy poderoso jugernaut cable Charles Javier el  que lleva puesta la 7 versión de cerebro se ve muy fuerte con ese casco  no se que tan poderoso sea pero seria genial verlo en este juego
DOOM STRAIGHT AURA FARMING IN EVERY FRAME.
I need that soundtrack. It's so good
As an MVC Fan. Im sad, we didn't get Marvel Vs Capcom. But as a fan of Team Fighting Games, Im happy.
Eligieron el peor diseño de Ghost Rider para el juego :( el clásico siempre será mejor
Marvel finally realized Injustice exists
ARC SYSTEM RELEASE DEADPOOL AND MY LIFE IS YOURS
Great job, this video was very useful!
Im just waiting for the Hulk
People of this YouTube Channel and of these recent Marvel games, thank you!
This looks BADASS! ASW can do no wrong.
And STreet Fighter 😢😢😢😢😢de
Amazing content as always!
IS MAHVEL BAYEE!!
PRE ORDER 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
0:47  THE EMISSARY FROM HELL SUPIDA-MAN!
Why is every character so build or thick even the armored ones look like they been lifting
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
Amazing content as always!
You explained this so well, thank you!
I like that they used Robbie Reyes as the Ghost Rider for this game. He needs more recognition
Who else was completely blown away like Max Was?   And who else thought Ryu or any Capcom character was going to jump in?   Leave a Like
Phew, Magneto, Dr Doom, Thanos and Galactus are my favourite characters, glad one made it in.
Anything’s better than Street Fighter at this point! I’m in!!
Marvel X Arc System boutta shake the world up🔥
WOW  What a beautiful thing
Okay this is epic
So ... Capcom was the Problem?
今日もお見事！大勝利！のスパイディが、ルンルンで可愛い
Soo good
Finally a Storm design that doesn't f@#$ing MOHAWK!!!! JESUS
*Um*
Over/Under number of characters in the game?
Fighting game players have been eatin SO GOOD
where is cyclops?????
Guilty Gear + Marvel:
God why did they put Ms. Marvel in this? Nobody actually likes that character. Smh
this game is in good hands
I LOVE THIS
esta mejor hecho que Hunter X Hunter nenXimpact xDDD
Having arc make a marvel fighting game is most likely the best decision if  it was a choice between arc and capcom . Different art styles, gameplay, and music will breathe new life into a marvel fighting game. I swear  Capcom games just seemed lifeless since ultimate m v c 3.
Only playstation?
Add Thor, Loki, Wolverine, Sabertooth, Deadpool, Hulk, Thanos, The entire FF, give me a roster bigger than Marvel Vs Capcom 2.. and take my money!!!
I love when Japanese people voice Black people. It just doesn't fit and it's so funny to me
aw hell nah, why does Ghost Rider look like some forgotten Todoroki brother. like, he isn't even a skeleton he's just wearing some gloves from Spirit Halloween and a skull mask.
Its Mahvel Baby
Arcsys and marvel/ Never thought i'd see that.
1:24 How many u gonna watch this ? Me: YES
CAPCOM…？？？
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
This is a breath of fresh air. Nice
an arcade cabinet with 8 players would be so fun.
MARVEL VS MARVEL: FATE OF TWO MARVELS 😅
Please add White Black Panther
Not 2 not 3 FOUR?
Yessssssss baby yesssssss🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
its like marvel vs capcom .. just hope they have this in english
This STYLE! GOODNESS! Finally not some 3D nonsense style like MVC3
Oh boy can't wait for marvel vs blazblue vs gg vs fighterz
Dragon ball fighterz reference??
Sooooo no mvc but….. this?
FROSTY FAUSTINGS FINNA BE PEAK YUURD🔥🔥🔥
This go hard with the Japanese voices tbf
Japanesse Marvel ???
Finalmente Marvel al topon !!!
Arc System really put their foot into this
First FighterZ, NOW THIS?!?!
You explained this so well, thank you!
What kind of Dragon Ball FigterZ is this?
The gundam iron man goes hard 😩
Loved the content, keep it coming!
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
God, Marvel mixed with BlazBlue/Guilty Gear DNA, yes, please!😁😁
hope they go back to franchise exclusive titles for those good enough to warrant it especially spiderman and xmen....others that might be good include black panther, daredevil, ff4, avengers
Dragon marvel ball fighterz
Oof ps exclusive
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
Ok now how many characters in the roster
A marvel rivals looking fighting game???
To those who say that Arcsys doesn’t do alternate costumes, Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising has alternate costumes
Looks like a new game switch 2 not getting
Marvel finally realized video gaymes wont sell.
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
They said “What if we did Rivals as a fighting game but made it Weeaboo” and I’m here for it
MARVEL VS MARVEL !!!! XDDDDDD CAPCOM ZZZZ-Z-Z-ZZ
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
Looks sick but hoping we can change the audio to English.. none of those voices feel natural 🤷‍♂️
I hope they put it on the Switch 2 as well 👍🏾
I wish they'd make a Tokyo Ghoul game like this
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
Nice 👍
Marvel vs Marvel 🎉🎉
Cool but… why does everything need to be freaking anime nowadays
Better come out on the switch 2 I ain’t about to buy a ps5 just for this
Hulk Silver Surfer and Beta ray bill is all I need
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
Es Marvel vs Capcom literal solo chequen los combos de tormenta son los mismos de Marvel vs Capcom 3
Give me HULK!
Props on getting kamen rider voice actors XD
This just added on another 3 years to 2XKO development
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
You explained this so well, thank you!
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
since I haven't seen a comment about it, Emissary of Hell Spiderman's design is a modern take, Hope he uses Leopardon as his special
WHERE IS MAGNETO????????????
Netherealm don't even bother with Injustice 3
Gonna be DLC after DLC after DLC .... Cash grab from Marvel is coming. $20 for 4 characters and another $10 for new costumes....
You explained this so well, thank you!
At least give us the option for 1v1.
This was very informative, appreciate it.
Ya'll already know Deadpool finna be in the cut
My wishlist for characters: Heroes: Cyclops Black Panther  Shang Chi Daredevil  Bishop Wolverine  Deadpool Gamora Magik Rogue Bucky Blade Sue Storm  Villians:  Shocker Magneto Apocalypse  Kraven Venom Carnage Super Skrull Ultron Task Master Emma Frost Mystique  Nebula  Black Cat Doc Octopus  Loki Mysterio Mr. Sinister  Ghost High Evolutionary
Insane🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥!!! First Capcom now Arc System Works?!!! SO DOPE.
Marvel fighterz lets goooooo
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
Why oh' why is Ghost Ryder the Robie Rayez Ghost Rider when clearly the most popular one is Jhony Blaze?
Bring on rain bring on fire give me cyclops or I retire
Ok so taking out 2 characters is a Happy Birthday, taking out 3 is a Merry Christmas, what is it called when you take 4 out? Is it a Happy New Year?
Ok so it's Marvel vs Capcom, minus Capcom, plus an extra character per team, MULTIPLIED by Anime..... Aight cool, it's got my attention.
Thanks.
Can’t wait for DC vs marvel vs mortal kombat 😅
I cannot wait that long 😭
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
Bro where deadpool at. This game would be amazing if deadpool was in it.
Never knew i needed something so badly, till it was right in front of me
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
Sin capcom :0 ? Ojala solo no tegan infinitos por que si no deja de ser juego de peleas y se vuelve juego de ver quien da el primer golpe
I know DC is crying right now
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARC SYSTEM !!!!!!
Looks like a mobile game.
Marvel versus marvel is crazy
ITS MARVEL BABY
I like that Spider-Man is never allowed to look like Spider-Man for whatever reason
The graphics looks dope! Day one purchase for me.
I heard the artist of MHA made the character designs
huy me Moje ...!!!!
Doctor Doom aura farmed 1:22
Doom kinda looks like dbfz broly
hehe single tear for capcom :)
I hope there is a fairly extensive roster of characters and some Capcom characters as DLC 😅😅😅 Is that too much to ask??
There better be more than 8 characters to choose from 😂😂😂😂😂😂 also, Storm is a BADDiE
PLEASE don’t just be “MvC but without the C.”
DLC guna go crazy!!!!!!
I am seeing Capcom x Guilty Gear in the future
Bro.  Captain's design is giving me CHILLS.
I wanted the emissary from hell Spider-Man
So basically tekken but Marvel
Now we need to introduce Kamen Rider Zein as the unstoppable anti-hero.
Your move, Capcom.
MVC players sick right now
Bro not even developers can let Spiderman be happy, why was he getting rocked for half of the trailer 😭😭😭
Well, its arcsys, so I'll trust this enough to give it a try at launch. But if there are as many marvel-isms as midnight suns, Im gone
They’re finally working together! I’ve been wanting arc system works to do a marvel fighter for so long
MORE X-MEN!
Its like both of my favorite people got married 🥲
DBFZ but marvel👍
I've been around since XMen COTA, and This looks GOOD.
/peaks up from Mario Kart World for only a minute. Glad I didn't miss this but please tell me there's a ton more fighters. I needs my x-men.
This is going to be sick, Will there be 1v1 or classic tag team though 🙏
No capcom, no care
Close enough, Welcome back Dragon Ball Fighters
Hulk enter marvel tokon fighting souls
Since this is MVC's characters with P4AU's fighting system, this could very well become my favourite fighting game ever
Game looks fantastic, hopefully the balance team isn’t as ridiculously incompetent as the Rivals balance team is.
Imagine Spider-verse, X-Men, Avengers, Fantastic 4, Guardians of the Galaxy! Mind Blown!
No FOOT DIVE!!?…😢
foot dive!
Looks great but can use a little flair. Perhaps marvel vs capcom!
Starlord is giving off Billy Kidd vibes and I'm here for it.
Doom needs the footdive.... without it he's NOT DOOM
Starrord! 😂
4v4... Not everyone has the time to learn 4 characters....u guess I'll pass 😞
Better My hero academia games than hero academia games 😂
Now what I want to know is if a character goes down, will the match end or keep going until the whole team is down?
Make this game for ALL PLATFORMS! I NEED THIS ON XBOX!
They really took the best things from all their games and said here have a treat
So is this Marvel vs Marvel??
Marvel trading their movie quality for better quality games:  A soul for a soul
this pressureeeee ooooooo
Hello, Humans Work hard, while others waste time and believe themselves over everyone else.  TERRANCE OUT
Nicee
im wet
Reminds me of Naruto ultimate fighter on ps2 🔥
Marvel and ARC SYS WORKS ❤❤❤🎉
I love how it’s giving marvel vs capcom
Potentially we could get Marvel vs Guilty Gear in the future 🔥🔥🔥
RIP marvel vs capcom series :(
They should add all the Capcom characters back.
These new marvel games are so fire ngl
Domo!
Dude how do they have all these characters in this games and not marvel rivals
the dark ages are upon us
I can already imagine Deadpool being in this, speaking English and having no idea what the others are saying.
I know it’s going to be a PlayStation exclusive but please please please let this come to Xbox as well
Something feels off about this. I get its an anime fighter but it seem too clunky and limited in terms of movement so far. Hopefully Capcom ain't just fumble the franchise.
who needs fightersz
im glad spiderman doesnt have that stupid pose like in marvel vs capcom.
this is better than all the marvel vs capcom games. screw capcom😂😂
I hope we have a costume for the original ghost rider as well
We need the public ost so bad
Ms. Marvel looking kinda.... weird.
Is it free or nah
Finally, it seems like the marvel games are going in a good direction. First rivals to kick it off, now guilty gear marvel
Is this free to play ?
A waste of space on star lord and character roster got to be more hype
Wooooooo ❤
Marvel is PEAKING on gaming omg
Ironman become... Gundam???
Oh baby now imagine:  Cyclops Magneto Wolverine  Gambit Rogue
Game of the century
Does marvel hates johny blaze or something?
its just....so peak 😭
finally....something good about marvel
2xko is trash...
Look like SF
MY BODY IS READY
I came here expecting Marvel Super Heroes type game, but this is MAHHHHH VELLLLLL!!!! Need more characters though, this can't be it!!??
Please add Shuma-Gorath and Blackheart
This is Super Ultra Amazing 😭
Please Launch with about 16 more characters and include Gambit for the love of everything WHOLLY!
Not as cool looking as Infinite to me, but I like how they took things in the opposite direction and it will easily be more popular, unless the roster size complaints are a big deal. I really doubt the starting roster will be bigger than Infinite but maybe it will.
So doom's just not gonna footdive??
reminds me of skull girls
Amazing (ARC SYSTEM 👊🫡🔥)  but ... worst ms marvel ver !!!
nice dbfz reskin
Spiderman main in marvel rivals and this game
Bro, let me just tell ya’ll this  I’m in the kitchen eating, my daughter has her show on the big screen tv, I see THIS video on my phone…  I slowly go into the living room, explain to my daughter something important needs to happen. I commandeer the television and yelled the entire video    I don’t even have the words right now. As a marvel/fighting game fan, I can’t bruh..I can’t even wait
One word ... YES
Ah yes, we had the MCU now prepare for the MGU
Dragon Ball fighter Z
So glad they used robbie reyes for ghost rider, as he has THE coolest design out of any ghost rider (besides cosmic ghost rider)
Hype 😍
Welcome back, BBTAG
Lyrical gun was epic
Source verse 3 gave me chills
1:56 FOOT DIVE!
Marvel vs Capcom Infinite  Remastered xD
Still trying to make ms. Marvel happen huh. Girl dhalsim 🙄.
DLCs gonna be out this world.. Give me Nightcrawler and take my card!!
It's literally Dragon Ball FighterZ but Marvel  ✋😐🤚 ABSOLUTE CINEMA
I’m preordering ultimate edition immediately
All I can say is us Storm fans have been eating good back to back 🙏🙏🙏 Looking amazing in every game she comes out 😱
This is dragon ball z fighters with marvel characters.
MADE BY THE SAME PEOPLE WHO MADE DRAGON BALL FIGHTERZ. THERE BETTER BE RAID BOSSES THIS IS PEAK
Hello lovely people 👋
i want cable, bishop, deadpool and blade on same team
whats the parlay on this being another arcsys trash heap?
Let’s fricken go, really looks like Marvel vs Capcom and I’m excited for this game right here and my boy Doctor Doom they didn’t miss once. The fricken Doom gun from the VERY FIRST Fantastic Four movie is crazy
Max is freaking out after watching this 😆
Bro I’m done with rivals, IM GRINDING THIS GAME, AND ENTERING ANY TOURNAMENTS FOR IT RIGHT AWAY!!!
… so why exactly was spiderman getting his shi rocked by everyone at the end? 😅
YESSSSSSSSSSSS
Will there be English voices?
Arcsys will do great
Captain America with a jacket is the most Guilty Gear thing ever and I love it
Matana baby is the greatest super line ever.
Unless it has my boy, Jeff, I ain’t interested. He’s the only character that I truly like from Marvel.
Spidyyyy sense😂❤
Marvel tekken
English?🥱
I'm sure they're doing it and he's voicing him but I'm saying it anyways. If they do an English dub of this game and Star Lord's *_NOT_* voiced by Chris Pratt, I'm not buying. 😠
starlord and cap having a way more masculine voice than cap lol
This is awesome, but I hope they fix strive before this game comes out. I'm worried that arcsys is developing a habit of releasing a horrible patch for a game (Like they have with GG Strive and DBFZ) right before a new big release. Which I think is a tactic to have people go buy the new game. Really gross so I hope I'm wrong. I've put a lot of hours into Strive and it sucks that I just kinda hate it now because of how much they've just messed up balance wise.
Hopefully Ryu or Ken make an appearance
Marvel SPARKING ZERO…. 😒😏
Now imagine if for the english version, they could get all the MCU actors !!! (sure, the budget will triple, but hey... if they're paid by line, it shouldn't be to expensive, right ^^ ?)
Anyone else gonna miss capcom characters?
No xbox? its trash never buying it   (I'll do it anyway)
I'M So Hyped Marvel Tõkon Fighter Souls 2026
Hope it’s not free to play
Wow, that's incredible. I wouldn't be surprised if Injustice 3 was announced at any moment.
when you say 4 v 4, is it 4 people vs 4 people or 4 characters switching?
What about Xbox 😭😭😞
I need daredevil in this.
LEEEEEEETS GOOOOOOOO
Look Amazing Marvel Tõkon Fighter Souls
Well this is comin earlier than 2XKO
Another game I must play for storm
I Love Marvel Tõkon Fighter Souls
Just remember All CAPS when you spell the name
So insanely milked that the milk is clear like water.
Please please please be crossplay🙏🙏🙏, doesn't even need to be for ranked just casuals. Biggest place where Dragon Ball Sparking Zero fumbled
FighterZ engine?
1:53 love this sync with music
Ironman looks like a Gundam
0:33 Reverse Sol Badguy air punch
Finally a Mortal Kombat for Marvel
pls tell me itll be dubbed too
Please add Lin Lie's Iron Fist
Forget Injustice 3 - I'm getting this !!
DR DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
The 1995 Marvel Super Heroes arcade game by Capcom was a big part of my childhood. This trailer brings back so many memories with the characters' fighting moves really recalling those classic games!
1:30 top tier choice of voice actor for Doom. I might actually cry
yo marvel! tips from a DBFZ pro :  if you want to push it to tournaments level you need to up the pace of everything thank me later fluidity is key! especially in a 2D game
AWESOME!!!!
My dreams of a One Piece FighterZ have been crushed....  Game looks good tho
so... Cap. America is voice by Nakamura Yuichi and Storm is voiced by Sawashiro Miyuki or am I crazy?
In another world, Keiji Fujiwara would still be Tony Starks seiyuu.
love that they used the new ghostrider
Wow! My Hero Academia X Marvel looking good 🗣🔥🔥
If only DC Comics would have had this idea...
That's the best Captain America has EVER looked. The comics need to use this design with the open jacket
Marvel and Arksystemworks- "What are our projected profit margins?", customer- "YES...." *proceeds to slam credit card on desk repeatedly WHAM, WHAM, WHAM!!!*
DUDE! 🤯🤯🤯🤯
No Squirrel Girl no buy!
the absolute shittiest name ever thought up but the most glorious of all marriages. I'm crying. Both happy and sad.
Game design trash 😭 🗑️😞😞
are you telling me this is Marvel FighterZ????
So...Dragonball FighterZ...but with Marvel heroes....lol.
4v4?! So many movesets to memorize 😅
Seeing as this is japanese themed I hope that some more japanese characters made it into the roster. My biggest hope is for Makoto (Hurricane) from Future Avengers
Never thought I needed to hear Ghost Rider say "Fasten your seat belts" until now
Yesss now Street fighter rose character just drop so hype
Great job, this video was very useful!
BRO I DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT IM SEEING
This looks like it has the same-ish game mechanics as MVC2.  Someone confirm that
Japanese everything I love it. The voices acting sounds better, the character designs are amazing too.
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
4v4? Sounds Fantastic.
Marvel has been cooking outside of the US
I'll say it: Ghost rider's car SUCKS, where is the bike?!
A fighting game roster that has the potential to be much  more than Smash Ultimate
Yeah! Marvel Vs. Marvel! :D
I love how the entire trailer is just Spider-Man getting beat up. Glad the game's staying comic accurate.
Exclusivo?
Is Storm VA voices Jolyne from JoJo part6 ?
Low tier god gonna love this *
This game's gonna take us for a ride.
This is finally daredevils game. Put him in
Love the art direction and animations 👍🏼👍🏼
DBFZ players we come together to rejoice
if Arcsys and Capcom are chill i'm predicting that they patch in Capcom with an update to create Marvel Vs. Capcom in a sense.
Hell. Yes.
No foot dive?
This would be the first marvel fighting game released since stan lee died.
Okay!! So WHEN ARE WE GETTING FIGURES BASED ON THESE DESIGNS?!
퀄리티 ㄷㄷ
0:57 ese movimiento es de Dante  That movement is from Dante
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
Tokon? Tekken?
Capcom has been dropping the ball glad to see someone else do fighting game with marvel
No está mal, me recuerda a MarvelvsCapcom, y algunos de sus movimientos a otros personajes que lo tenían, pero me encanta, espero que den más personajes  It's not bad, it reminds me of Marvel vs Capcom, and some of its movements to other characters who had it, but I love it, I hope they give more characters
Marvel Civil warZ Super
Game looks amazing, Take my money! I'm even dumb enough to pre order 😆
In Arc we trust!
Looks like another version of Marvel vs Capcom 3 to me.
This should've been a new Marvel vs. Capcom. What a missed opportunity
ITS MAHVEL BABY
Now that’s a game 🤌
Some of these moves are literally out of fighterz
Hopefully American voice overs. This is awful
why does ghost rider sound like a random teenager
Marvel Anime is back
Where squirrel girl
nooo not japanese
Loved the content, keep it coming!
I think it would be funny if Deadpool was the only character who speaks English in this game, kind of like Frank West in Tatsunoko VS Capcom, except here he breaks the fourth wall about the language barriers.
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
Bring on Blackheart!
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
The things I'm feeling for this game are something I haven't felt for one in a really long time, honestly.
Why this game give me jojos vibes?
When MvC 4 fails, they restart with MvM
2:05 did Reyes just pulled a Red Line move???
Nice Japanese voice !
Put either *Gambit* or *Omega Red* in and it's a *day 1 purchase* for me.  *I am not kidding!*
Saquenlo tmb pa xbox , no sean uleros
Xbox???????????
QUE CAGADA
Street fighter Marvel before GTA 6😂
Im getting Marvel ed out. Im not playing this AND rivals
This looks beautiful. Capcom really is slipping lately.
Marvel fans be eating good since No Way Home!
LET'S GO! I LOVE THESE DESIGNS SO MUCH! THE GUNDAM IRON MAN! STEVE'S JACKET! OMG!   IF THIS IS FREE, I WILL BE SO HAPPY!
It looks like a re-skin of dragon ball fighterz
Marvel looking like dragon Ball Fighterz
Sugoiii
"Sony mató marvel vs capcom" 🗣️🗣️
This is what Marvel vs Capcom Infinite should have been like, not like the crap they gave us.
Looks trash honestly
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
Who’s that 0:39 ????
gawd damnyo i need that
Can’t wait.
captain america speaking japanese just hurts me in a next level XD i hope there will be english dub or something, kinda anyhting but this 😅
I'd be excited if it wasn't yet another PlayStation console exclusive.... Oh well.
SDDS MARVEL VS CAPCOM ❤❤😢
0:58 Despite this being a solo Marvel title, Dante still finds a way to make himself known
I’m waiting for a Detroit smash 💀
The Doombots 😭
Can we get an English dub for this game btw, I mean I hope this game doesn't become another undubbed game like jump force for some reason
Wow!!!! Arc systems and Marvel who would have thought!
A Marvel fighting game from the makers of Guilty Gear?  Awesome!  I can't wait to play this on Xbox!
Captain America: Civil War -- anime fighter edition!
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
First Marvel Rivals, and now THIS!  100x better than Disney Marvel!
I imagine for some of you, this would be the first time hearing these characters in Japanese. I mean for MvC had no Japanese audio for these characters barring the Capcom side. But it was a standard for Capcom games with characters outside of Japan at the time. Which is definitely not the case for ArcSys.
bruh marvel is taking over the market. first rivals next that other beat em up game and now this?! bruh i cannot wait. iom not even good at fighting games lol
drooled watching this
I'm i the only one who liked how the marvel characters where speaking Japanese 😅
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
I'm about to cry right now. Tears of joy!
DANG this game looks good. Little scared of 4v4, that seems like a LOT of potential combos but we'll see.
In before we get a crossover between this and Marvel rivals.
The DLC potential
Physical copy?
I'm no longer mad about the cancelled black panther game  This is awesome 😎
Marvel VS Capcom 2 remake with this style would be nice
This is dragon ball fighter z but marvel…
this is the dark souls of marvel fighting games
Release day I’m there🙌
Looks fun!
So this is basically just dragon ball fighterz but marvel edition. I’m down with it.
Looks Impressive & Interesting!
Doesn't look that good. It's too slow and I don't think I'm a fan of the characters tagging in during mid-combo. We'll see how this goes. Still waiting on a game that's better than MVC2.
Why is it in japanese?
This was exactly what I needed, thanks!
Please tell me spidey gets mech akin to the japanese spiderman
Your consistency is inspiring—keep going
Marvel really messed up. not allowing Xbox or Nintendo gamers to be able to enjoy this game was a FOUL!
I ve had this on repeat all day
They need to have all the characters from Marvel Strikeforce
Please Add The Fantastic Four to Tokon's Base Roster
This video randomly popped up and I m glad it did
Can we all agree this creator deserves more recognition
They cooked so incredibly hard with this one, day one i’m there!
BEAUTIFULL
I need to pre order this now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Finally… MARVEL SUPERHEROES 2!!!!!!!!
1:34 MOTHER HAS ARRIVED⚡️⚡️⚡️
🧲 Magneto -------⚙️
Honestly the 4v4 aspect might be too overly complicated and overwhelming visually. We will have to see when it comes out but from the looks of it it might not be as easy for newer people to pickup if thats the case
Anyone else look at these and immediately say to themselves "I can't wait for these Figures?"

I learned more in 10 minutes than hours of Googling
This was super helpful, thanks!
Oh Capcom really dropped the ball 😂
Amazing content as always!
Cant wait to see the full roster. Hopefully Blade and the Fantastic 4 will make their fighting game debut.
Your consistency is inspiring—keep going

Este juego con el ESTILO DE ORIGEN DEL GUILTY GEAR, DESPUES LO HIZO EL DRAGON BALL AHORA LE TOCA A MARVEL ES MAS DE LO MISMO NO SORPRENDE NADA PUE... ASI NO DIGAN OOOOH QUE JUEGO. ES COMO AL JUGAR AL GUILTY GEAR PERO CON TRAJES DE MARVEL Y ESTILO DE PERSONAJES DE MARVEL NADA MAS. POR LA MISMA EMPRESA ARC SYSTEM WORKS...
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
i like this game, it looks AMAZING, however i have one complaint...     Missed opportunity to have Spidey say "Emissary From Hell... Spider-Man!!!"
That transition at 3:12 was chefs kiss
Fantastic explanation, thank you!

When the trailer premiered I was like "I Hear japanese voices but they are painting Marvel characters.... oh it's a new fighting game!!! WOOOO!"
Marvel went to Arc Studios after capcom screwed up MVC infinite soo bad lol
Great job, this video was very useful!
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
Is that Diavolo as Ghost Rider?
A better MCOC! Finally!!
Fighting games  is a small enough genre for the game to be gatekept from a potential audience pool of 34M Xbox users.. Seems like an ego decision more than a business one. Another fighting game that will end up with the same player pool of a 1,000
I can t stop smiling watching this
yess YEEEEESSSSSSS
Like fighter z
if a two character combo is a happy birthday and a three character combo is a merry christmas then a four character combo should be a happy new year
Marvel is really killing InJustice 3 before it's even been announced.
It's mahvel baby!  Will Deadpool still be shoryukening fools though? 😅
🤩
悪魔博士！？
It said CROSSOVER……Yea they got my money just from that alone

Great job, this video was very useful!
We got Marvel Ball FighterZ before GTA6
I hope Marvel becomes the face of games in the future
I didn t expect to love this as much as I do
You explained this so well, thank you!
Arc Systems is great choice definitely.  But why bring that lame Kamala in there....ugh.
This deserves way more views. Absolutely underrated
Bruh 🙌
Your consistency is inspiring—keep going
Pure talent. No words
reminds me of marvel rivals
1:26 DOOM HAS A GLOCK
I will pay full price for this game and not even care. This looks awesome!
This was super helpful, thanks!
Fantastic explanation, thank you!
Doctor Doom has also similar fight style as some fighter I know in an arcade game as well. Which is very cool. I'm waiting to see which other characters will come out I'm hoping "MAGNETO" and it will not fit but I also wanna see quicksilver
Algorithm finally did something right
no xbox .....
I’m so used to see Capcom logo
If this is the music for the trailer I am so looking forward to the tunes in the full game
Algorithm finally did something right

Fantastic explanation, thank you!
Spiritual Successor of Capcom's Marvel Super Heroes mixed with MVC is finally here!
Everything here is great except for ms marvel. When will marvel stop pushing her on us. She’s not cool, she’s not an interesting character, she’s not a unique character, she is not popular.
Bruh I don’t have a PlayStation I’m so cooked
Pure talent. No words
Great job, this video was very useful!

Japanese voice acting on Marvel Characters just feels wrong.
This was super helpful, thanks!
Thank you for this video, very enlightening!
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
Is it just me or does it sound like the character theme transitions when you tag another character? It's very noticeable when Star Lord tags Doom around 1:15... BTW Doom's  theme is amazing! ❤
Marvel characters speaking Japanese is simply unfitting. Sorry, it just doesn't work for me. Give them their longtime English voices and then I might be interested.
IT'S MARVEL BABYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
¿XBOX? 🥺🥺🥺
I didn t expect to love this as much as I do
Marvel vs capcom but without capcom. Star-Lord ult = dante ult, mrs Marvel moveset = Super-scrull  mvc3 moveset. This is strange...🫤
Japan and China carrying marvel
Add Slapstick as a playable fighter, you cowards
That part at 2:45 Instant goosebumps
格ゲー苦手だけどやりたい
First mk legacy edition than this, the FGC eating good rn 😭 🙏🏼
Ryu: “ I look forward to our next battl..wait a minute .” Hello?
When this comes out I will be playing Storm ⛈ period omg yesssssss❤❤❤❤and we need they voice in English as well
storm being the best x-man or marvel character, then ghost rider to raise hell on us all.
This was very informative, appreciate it.
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
Add Nightcrawler
Am I tripping or does this look better than most fighter games of this genre
This video was amazing, learned a lot.
So, I wonder who proposed to put mvc2 in EVO main event?   Sony or Capcom? If its Sony, does CAPCOM know this game would annouce before EVO?
This was very informative, appreciate it.
I'm getting burned out on their movies (so much multiverse...) but Arc fighting?  Midnight Suns was pretty epic, too...  Maybe I shouldn't sleep on Marvel 😁
Those are some awesome costume designs :)
Mood instantly lifted. Thank you for this
supaidah mann... those who know know
Please be a 1v1 game

ArcSys here to save the FGC.
WHY THEY KEEP USING HELL CHARGER??? HES NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR GHOST RIDER!!!
Finally... Guilty Gear Marvel
I tossed my phone in the air when I saw this reveal live. Feel like a kid in the arcade seeing marvel fighters for the first time
After Infinite terrible performance/art direction this is much needed. Hope this plays as good as fighterz.
Dragon Ball Fighterz 2 is looking wierd
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
When they make Ms Marvel tolerable, they are going in the right way

This looks fun and i dislike fighting games
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Teken ❌ Tokon ✅
That transition at 3:12 was chefs kiss
If they put cyclops it's GAME OVER 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🤌🏽
IF THEY PLAY THEIR CARDS RIGHT, IF DEADPOOL IS IN THIS GAME THEY CAN BRING BACK DIO TO VOICE HIM AGAIN !!
Biggest hype ever since a loooooong time, thank you arc sys !!!
I hope Psyloke,Hawkeye and black  panther get added
As badass as it sounds, I’m hoping they will have their iconic English voice actors
That transition at 3:12 was chefs kiss
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
Your consistency is inspiring—keep going
so this means marvel vs capcom is dead now?
Between this and Rivals DC is on life support 😭😭
Marvel games finally learn there lesson, let the specialists do your job and take the IP money 😂😂
Where is Carnage?!
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
Where is Deadpool?
I ve had this on repeat all day
Captain America with Gojo voice is masterpiece
Loved this video, keep up the great work!
why are there voices in Japanese
Game looks great but Ms. Marvel is the biggest industry plant that's ever existed
This video randomly popped up and I m glad it did
That part at 2:45 Instant goosebumps
hope its not just 8 characters and we have to buy all the rest lol, and really hope they have an option for English voice lines too, I dont wanna read the whole game while fighting. Can't wait though.
Yippee, more Robbie Reyes rep

Such an amazingly produced trailer. The visuals, art direction and character design are so impressive, but can we also take a second to appreciate the soundtrack here?! The music absolutely 'slaps', as the kids say.
Arc System Works: “Fine, I’ll do it myself”
God I wish I didn’t suck at fighting games. This looks amazing
Why they never make a third person fighter, they got the craziest budget and mechanics for it 😭🙏
Awesome video, looking forward to the next one!
Even to the Japanese, Steve Rogers is Captain America.
Loved the content, keep it coming!
Star Lord with that Dante swagger

CHANGE THIS TO MARVEL VRS CAPCOM BUT FAST
Great video! Really enjoyed it.
If you land a combo on 2 characters at the same time, it's called a Happy Birthday. If it's on 3, it's a Merry Christmas. Does this mean we can land a Happy 4th of July if we can land combos on an entire team of 4?!
Loved the content, keep it coming!
CHANGE THIS TO MARVEL VRS CAPCOM FASST
English voice acting?!!
Nahhh... mvc3 and mvci was trash. This one isn't any better.
Came for the thumbnail, stayed for the vibes
**Marvel Vs Capcom Infinite exists**  Arc Systemworks: And I took that personally.
This was super helpful, thanks!
I learned more in 10 minutes than hours of Googling
Foda
Ah yes, another reason why I have a PlayStation instead of Xbox
You will play it in his original language, japanese, right?
Can we still say “ITS MAHVEL BABY” or should we start saying “maveru desu”?
Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!
Did Capcom lose the licence??
Am I’m the only one here thinking that this game looks like dragon ball fighterZ
imagine if they had stands
You explained this so well, thank you!
First DB now marvel. Wonder what's next for arc.  Edit: me and my friends dreamed of a marvel game like fighterZ when it came out. Nice to see Arc is delivering
What about Xbox Series X/S?
If you can’t give us marvel online like dcuo then stop. Marvel only steals other people formula for video games and shuts down a lot of other games. Dcuo been running for over 20 years, marvel could never
Looks awesome. Needs a hefty roster
What a time to be alive!!! Thank you Marvel and Disney for putting your character in Arksys hands!! Now let them cook!!
This video randomly popped up and I m glad it did
Sounds so cool
Perfect.

A capcom ficou de fora dessa vez 👀
There go my hopes of a Marvel vs DC or Marvel vs Mortal Kombat dreams...
I didn t expect to love this as much as I do
This entire concept is completely unhinged and I AM SO EXCITED.
really hope dormammu will be in this game
So... its basically Dragon Ball fighterz but with marvel characters....
Mine!!!!
Boycotting arcsys until they start treating Xbox fairly and stop letting Sony gatekeep all the fighting games
Marvel firing up that ARC reactor!
why Starlord’s move like Dante? 🤔

Best looking fighting game I’ve seen in awhile
It’s so wildly interesting to hear other languages concept on character voices lol
Mood instantly lifted. Thank you for this
Pure talent. No words
The Captain America and Iron Man designs are insanely good looking. Doom's looking fresh as always
Haven’t played many Arc Sys games but I wonder how big this roster is gonna be base game.
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
i miss my wife
This is going straight into my favorites playlist
I feel like the took Storms classic outfit and combo'd it with Syble from Psuedoregalia's fit.  Love it
If they don't add a Supaida-Man skin..
No DEI detected here so game is going to be a success. 🤣

Giant mistake not having Doom do the foot dive at least once

This game is missing capcom
A non-capcom Marvel is weird. My brain can't compute those Spiderman moves.
If doom dont make a foot dive, im going to be disappointed

I admit, I never saw this coming. I thought for a while Marvel will cross with Capcom in the distant future. I guess now Marvel vs. Capcom is no longer necessary, now that this new Marvel fighting game was announced. It would be even better, if NetherRealm Studios announces and releases Injustice 3, so Marvel and DC can compete with each other in a fighting game circuit. Since this game will be 4v4, just like KOF had during NESTS saga, it would be fitting for the character roster to have 40 characters at launch.
Horikoshi character design 🔥
Ps5 and pc✅ Switch and xbox❓  Serious? Buy a new console only for play this..? Of course I do
Algorithm finally did something right
This video randomly popped up and I m glad it did
playstation only 💀
Old school Vibes ❤
I click anything with Ghost Rider
Wow, i wanna kamen rider fighting games just like this one, not the crap warrior style
What y'all got against Spider-man tho? That ain't cool man 😂😅
This looks amazing
Awesome 😸✊ a must have 👍 Big thanks to the Producers
Bro this looks absolutely amazing
Fighting games without heavy story modes that actually do something or pointless. Stop making quarter eater games, those things have no reason to exist anymore.
Whens mahvel? Right now baybee!!
Can't wait for the Paul DLC
I see friendship was ended with Capcom, now ArcSys is their fighting game company
You just earned a new subscriber
lets gooooo
This is going straight into my favorites playlist
Tōken gets the token character of Ms. Marvel over Reed Richards. I guess I can live with that in exchange for Arc System Works making the game.  DC, take notes. Injustice was fun while it lasted, but this is the stylization that gamers crave.
Esto es un plagio total de los marvel vs Capcom saga , que bajo cayo disney 😢
Yeah Riot keep delaying 2XKO see what it does to you 🤣
That transition at 3:12 was chefs kiss
Just take my money
I absolutely love it it’s just like a street fighter style video game definitely will be buying 👍
The fact that they have Japanese subtitles is awesome
Kinda random character picks but I like the style of the game🧐
1:29 let me main doom
Probably isn't going to happen, but I really hope they give Dr. Doom the foot dive move
Still trying to make Miss Marvel into a headliner, huh?  Imagine if it was someone like Hulk, Juggernaut, or The Thing so we had a big body representative.  Edit: Storm looks so much better with human hair.
Marvel vs [empty space] 4
Rdc finna have a field day with this one 😭
Music ID anybody??? please
Supaidāman!!!
😊
This looks great... will there be an english dub though?
Call me crazy but I might actually pick Japanese voices
You just earned a new subscriber
Sooooo street fighter just all marvel
I forgot how awesome Japanese is to listen to
Woooww the artwork are soo Beautiful ❤❤❤
Pass
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
We’ll see…
The Hype is real...
injustice, you have 24 hours to respond
unlucky timing for 2XKO
Mood instantly lifted. Thank you for this
meh
broooo no xbox 😢
ooh this looks interesting!
THIS IS HOW YOU DESIGN YOUR CHARACTERS, MARVEL!!! STOP LETTING WESTERN STUDIOS BUTCHER THEM.
Sick! Now we wait for Capcom vs Capcom, and then we wait for the epic never before seen clash between the two in 8 years
YESSSS
Marvel tenías tiempo de no presentar algo digno
KAMALA KHAN APPAREANCE LETS GOOOOOOOOO
Look at dat...No Cap.... Lets Go
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
Esse combo no alto lembrou muito os jogos da Marvel dos anos 90
0:59 such a dante carbon copy. No capcom no sell for me. I am not a marvel fan. But itll do well im sure
Imagina o Venon o Dente de Sabre e o Wolverine nesses graficos, vai ficar muito lega..
Looks amazing but what's this obsession with 'tag team' escalation in fighting games? We are going to end up with full roster v full roster at this rate.
This is the best fighting game studio that Marvel could’ve given their license to. And the best property today that Arc System could’ve gotten. The timing is amazing! They’ve done so well with GG Stride and DB Fighterz
Doom with a 9 was not on my bingo card
That part at 2:45 Instant goosebumps
They seriously had to show her on the first minute. They forgot how the last marvel game failed cause of that character.
Does anyone think they will add more characters over time?
Its feels more like Marvel vs Capcom than Marvel vs Capcom 4
Why do they keep putting Kamala Kahn in everything?? Is she really that popular and I just don't realize it??
Marvel Fighterz 🔥🔥🔥🔥😂
Gimme an English dub like the first 3 BBs had and Im in
This looks  like  guilty gear strive
marbhal gameso
Marvel vs Capcom: Marvel Rivals Edition
Bummed as all hell this isn't on Xbox man.
They may have ruined the movies but the games are going hard!
Bring back marvel vs capcom pls
Super happy Marvel games are now being made in Japan/China instead of USA.. The character designs and gameplay actually looks great and fun.. USA game devs (minus indie devs) have lost their way a long time ago.
Marvel vs. capcom, please take notes. This is what your next game should look and play like.
I am way too excited for this
Wheres goku
Marvel has created fighterz and dragon Ball have created rivals😂
We're so back
Can we talk how Spidey's suit looks like a tech-upgraded Ben Reilly's suit (Sensational Spider-man) 🤩
honestamente, só o fato de estar em japonês já me ganhou.
1:42 That wind effect, it seems like Storm will play similarly to Rachel Alucard from Arcsys' Blazblue but without the traps and projectiles.
love storm, but would love cyclops... why modern marvel hate cyclops? Is the f*** leader of the x-men. You dont make an avengers game without Captain, but for some reason marvel games with some x-men refuses to put cyclops... is so annoying.  Yeah.. he probably will come in some DLC (OR MAYBE JUST MAYBE even gonna come in the main rooster , i'm pretty sure this game will not release with just 8 fighters, still...), but why can't he be the first pick for once? in Fortnite, they add, rogue, gambit, storm, wolverine, mystic, magneto, and i think someone else , before they think add cyclops, and even so he came with jubilee.. like the leader of x-men as the same level of popularity ...., i like very much jubilee ... but ffs...
Anyone else here expected to see ryu leon dante and mega man to just pop up on screen 😭
This video randomly popped up and I m glad it did
Mahvel is dead. Long live Mahvel.
Gotta love how doom just casually carries a Luger
I've never been more excited to watch high level play of a fighting game. This is gonna be amazing.
🤯🤯
1:14 Ghost Ridersounds like Kamina from Gurren Lagann 1:34 My beloved Miyuki Sawashiro(Raiden Mei) is playing Storm
Ain't no way spider man said "SPIDEY SENSE" 😭🙏
I ve had this on repeat all day
Marvel bought Dragonball Fighterz!
Traditional X anime back to block airdash tag/assist fighter and not a Tekken-like with a name like Tōkkon? 😂
That part at 2:45 Instant goosebumps
So will we be getting a Marvel vs Arc Systems soon?  Sol Badguy vs Captain America?
add iron fist
marvel street rivals
Mah boy Doom is back, and hes not hitting the gritty. Hes hitting You. LETs Go!!
This has that play station Naruto PvP game vibe to it
Why One Piece can't have this such kind of game like DBZ fighter Z.
Probably not gonna happen But I would actually cry tears of joy if they got Naoki to do songs for each character
Absolute Cinema.
Iron man just looks like a tiny gundam and Im all here for it
Why no xbox
THIS GAME LOOKS SICK I COULDN'T ASK FOR ANYTHING TO MAKE IT COO)ER, THE GUILTY GEAR GANG MAKES MARVEL VS MARVEL??? AND MS MARVEL IS IN IT???? GOATED DEPARTMENT WE GOT A LIVE ONE OVER HERE
We got Japanese Marvel Game before GTA VI
Don't get me wrong i love what i am seeing ,this really looks like peak.But why is every new marvel thing coming out have to include Miss marvel( she doesn't even have a big fan base, who are they trying to appease too?)
Stop playing with me 😱 ooo I’m so excited
I was thinking like " Ain't gonna play" until I saw that gorgeous Storm she is so fine on this one that make me want the game '-'
😮😮 Arc System Works and Marvel 😮😮
This looks really good. If they made an MMO with a style like this, it would do really well.
No xbox?
Time for DC vs Capcom
I’m actually so hype for this 😭😭😭 remind me a lot of dragon ball fighterz
Everyone: Now as my special Ill use my cool powers to defeat my enemy  Doom: Pulls out 9mm
Finally marvel vs capcom 5 is real 😂
Alr, so far: 0:29 Mappa Hunch 0:32 Homing attack  0:52 Wallbreak 1:08 AXEEEEEL LOOOOOOOW 1:28 sorta Goldlewis super  Didn't cover basic mechanics, just GGST things
Mood instantly lifted. Thank you for this
Lol. Ms Marvel the third character to appear. They reallllllllly trying. But I just don’t care about her
Kinda wished they used old school Star-Lord once in a while.
Cannot waitttt
As I told my brother yesterday, this is the glorious return of Marvel Super Heroes
I want a Marvel MOBA 😢
marvel is on an INSANE run
Oh wow this looks good!!! Too bad its for gaystation
2:01 Ms. Marvel is so cute
Game looks excellent. A pity I don't have to play games like these
Mortal kombat ahh game but still cool
If Deadpool isn't in this at all in any form... Imma riot
No Hulk? 😢
Dr. Doom walk down gas
PQP que coisa linda
This is marvel vs capcom
Ironman with a Gundam's horn is a nice touch.
honestly speaking when it comes down to Capcom versus Marvel Everybody Plays the Marvel characters anyway
This is basically Marvel saying we're tired waiting on Capcom. We'll get it on our own😂
I met Arc System Works last year. I've been playing Strif, XRD Rev 2, Blazblue and Granblue...  and I do trust them with this one.
Where is FOOTDIVE!
That transition at 3:12 was chefs kiss
This is sooo beautiful 🤩 !!!
im overstimulated by this
Oh NAH Doom is way too cold I already know who I’m finna main
Japan, O país dos jogos de luta do mundo e de todos os tempos
IRONMAN WITH GUNDAM FACE 😂
So street fighter with marvel characters
This is as Japanese as a fiction can be
They are really investing on gaming lolol
If I had to guess, it'll have 3 attack buttons for light medium heavy, and 3 assist buttons.
Lowkey these designs are fire!!!🔥
It looks like fighterz and guilty gear had a kid that loves heroes
Where is foot dive???
Ok but is zero gonna be in this one?
the super animations are going to be legendary
They should do collabs with Marvel Rivals! A Gundam Iron Man skin would sell like hotcakes
SPIDA MADA...............
MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls, launching 2026 on PS5 and PC!  PS4 User: 😭😭😭
Can we all agree this creator deserves more recognition
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
Well, Im not gonna be playing rivals anymore when this comes out
Please start making these cool new games ps4 as well😢
Everyone: We want Marvel vs Capcom 4! ArcSys: We can give you Marvel, and we can give you 4. Take it or leave it.
We are so back!!
It's always a pleasure to be a Marvel fan.🗿👌🏼
Finalmente a Marvel entedeu como ganhar dinheiro... cadê  VENOM?
1:25 Doom with the blicky 😂
Where's Supaidaman???
I'm almost sure starlord is just Dante in disguise
ITS STILL MAHVEL BABY
Sees this on feed "Meh, ill watch  the trailer. Probably an easy kids game" *arc systems logo appears* "HOLY S*** DUDE!!!"
MAHVEL IS UPON US
Top things missing:  1. Capcom
Impace frames.
Just give us another marvel vs capcom
WOW, THAT WAS UNEXPECTED!!!  This is definitely worth playing. I sincerely hope they dub this game into English, Latin American Spanish, and other available languages.  The 4 vs 4 fight left me speechless.  THANK YOU SO MUCH MARVEL!!! 🌟😎🤩👍🏻
The art style is just PERFECTION. I'd love to see something like this on the big screens some day.
Who else is here before this blows up
So glad they picked ArcSys this game is going to be unbelievable
Marvel version of fighterz?😁(Or marvel vs capcom ig)
This video randomly popped up and I m glad it did
なんで日本を敵視してるマーベルが日本のゲーム会社に依頼してるんだ？
How much money did marvel rivals make ???!!!!
ARC SYSTEM ARE COOKING
Ms,Marvel 😭😭😭
Marvel is on the craziest run rn. Fantastic Four coming out next month, Rivals going crazy, this hype marvel fighterZ just getting announced, Doomsday dropping next December.. Man they’re on a roll rn
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
Do I hear Katsuyuki Konishi voicing Ghost Rider, the same voice actor for Diavolo in Jojo’s part 5? LETS GO!
why can't we just have an injustice like fighting game
Are we awake or is it a dream ?
Marvel VS Capcom but it's just Marvel and it's Anime Style?? Take my money. Take ALL OF MY MONEY!!!
lets goooo dnb🔥🔥🔥
As a life long marvel vs capcom fan. Literal tears of joy. Thank you arcsys and marvel ❤❤❤❤
tag-team fighters suck, just bring back 1v1 for the love of god. anyways looks sick
yama-chaaaaaaan!!!
I haven't been this excited for a fighting game since 2018!! Time to buy a PS5!
It’s Marvel versus Marvel. That’s the way it needs to be a little bit.
WHENS MAHVEL
So a mahvhel baby? Anyways loving it finally a good marvel fighting game since umvc3
This deserves way more views. Absolutely underrated
Day one, day two and all the days left.
Lol DC needs to keep up
That transition at 3:12 was chefs kiss
Hearing this in Japanese feels so wrong
Thank God 🤩❤️‍🔥
We need venom in the game when the game releases next year
Dr. Doom with a Mauser is crazy
Ghost Rider with a Redline reference is perfect
Marvel fighterZ
Eyo, where are my homies Wolverine, Hulk and Thor (maybe Deadpool)??? They DLC?? They're like, the only ones I would buy the game for, lol
Gambit, Rogue, Jean Grey, Emma frost... The possibilities are endless😍😍😍
Doom. With a gun. Say no more. Instant buy!!!
I sure do hope this somehow leads to more japanese developed Marvel games in the future
Oh wow this looks great. Please be a full priced game with a great roster and not loaded with Microtransactions.
❤🎉😢Nise video 📸 ❤😂🎉😮😅
Love the ARTTTT!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Arc system works really said "fine and I'll do it myself"
Take my money, please 🙏
Who else is here before this blows up
Marvel Presents, Marvel Comics!
It looks awesome!!!!
Marvel finally doing the game thing right on a consistent basis. Didn’t think I’d live to see it
MARVEL, BAYBE!
Not a fan of the name, I would've called it something like "Civil Wargames".
Your consistency is inspiring—keep going
Miss Marvel is in this too... pffff
bem q poderia ser marvel vs capcom 4
Nah I'll pass
ARCSYS!!???
Thos could have easily become Marvel vs Capcom 4
watching them talking japanese is sending me 🤣
Whoever's idea it was to give iron man gundam spikes on his head deserves a promotion
THIS is what the fgc has wanted for yrs. Especially us in the marvel fandom. THANK YOU ARC SYS
1:53 Close enough, welcome back Captain Storm.
first overwatch....now fightersZ..... what's next?
Finally, another good fighting game after UMvC3. 😮
Can I play this on Xbox
I love that they’re sprites again but it’s sooo crispy.
Duuuude, that animation style is SICK!
I don't think this means RIP MVC4 at all, I just think MVC4 is just coming way down the line that's all.  SF6 is still alive and well, Capcom is probably working on another fighting game right now, and also on another Fighting Collection for all we know. Trust.
F marvel vs capcom
where are Hulk, Thor, and other ?
🩷RIP XBOX PLAYERS😂🩷
MCU is good again
Dub please
Fighting games are the most repetitive games ever.. hard pass
Marvel vs Marvel ,   Capcom as DLC
1:52 someone help pete out geez
The Japanese voice acting is AAA+ we don't need the English dub for this game 😂
Who else is here before this blows up
Their friendship with Capcom ended like it did with SNK. 😞
For one second when seying spiderman web slinger i though was the spider mopher and we finnaly would get japanese spiderman leaopardon included
It has Spidey, Cap, Kamala and Doom so I'm excited as hell!
Who else is here before this blows up
This is going straight into my favorites playlist
Yuichi Nakamura reprise his role as Captain America since Marvel Studios films.
Perfect game i can't wait to play it
im so glad doom wont have his stupid otg stomp and rockets. very refreshing.
Tudo isso por apenas R$ 450,00
Dope... now can we get a new marvel ultimate alliance or something in that vein? Pretty please marvel.
That iron man suit didn't need to go to that level of epicness , but here we are..
This looks terrible
Feels werid seeing american super heroes scream their attacks lol
World Martial Arts Champion: Spider-Man!
Dragon ball z fighter vibes
Even though Capcom isn't directly involved, you can still see their influence:  They used Dante's movements in Starlord's Super 0:57  Ms. Marvel's Strech attacks are VERY reminiscent of Super Skrull from Marvel 3 0:40 Doom is giving me M.Bison vibes with his idle and walking animations 1:20
This video randomly popped up and I m glad it did
YEAH! This is how fighting games have to look like!
Why isn't this trailer in English? This is an American IP 😅  Kinda cool tho I guess
Es como si Marvel vs Capcom hubiera tenido un hijo con la mamá de Guilty Gear xd
1:26 Doctor Doom's Monarch Pistol
I can t stop smiling watching this
Day 1 buy. That is all.
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
Ngl, wanted fighterz 2 over this. But if I get to play wolverine I’m happy.
Did Horikoshi-sensei have a hand in character design?
Can we all agree this creator deserves more recognition
IN ARC SYSTEM WORKS WE TRUST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Soooo Happy right now
Que idioma tan horrible para un juego de Marvel.
poor video game dc dead 2020s
This video randomly popped up and I m glad it did
That part at 2:45 Instant goosebumps
Marvel vs Capcom ❌ Marvel vs Marvel ⭕
Db Fightersz????????
I just hope it's more than 20 characters
Man they heard MultiVersus was shutting down and was like "ight we'll just own the space then" 😂
This is JoJo reference?
ITS NOT FOR XBOX?
We want capcom…
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY NOW... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!
Whoever is in charge of all of this understood the assignment perfectly. 10/10, no notes.
Just give us English dub and I'm buying it 👍
Can we all agree this creator deserves more recognition
Para ser perfeito, o jogo precisa incluir Betsy e Kwannon. Captain Britain e Psylocke.
It's like the lovechild between Dragon Ball FighterZ and Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom!
Finally, people who respect Robbie Reyes
Power Ranger Ironman is peak
Pretty good pick for Marcel especially only thing is why is it in sub I live in America gah damit
So ... Dragon ball figterz with Marvel.
Cannot wait for EVO. 🔥🔥🔥🚒
Nice palette cleanser from that god awful Marvel vs Capcom Infinite
MARVEL WE NEED A MOBILE VERSION COMPATIBLE TO IOS LIKE THIS!
this looks great
Dunno why I hear Capcom crying from far away. 🥲
Marvel sure does love there fighting games
Dragonball - checked Marvel - checked Now I need Naruto
Ah.. reskinned FighterZ
This is what I wish Marvel's Conquest of Champions could be!
Ironman looks AWESOME!!
It’s so funny to me that starlord is like officially one of marvels A-listers, bro had quite the journey from total obscurity to being up there with captain America  (obviously he’s not quite on that level yet but you get what I mean)
Finally, Some fighterz Dlc
ヴェノム、ヴェノム、ヴェノム！！ ヴェノムを出してくれーーーー！！！
I ve had this on repeat all day
Your consistency is inspiring—keep going
*first time heroes are switching Okay, its 3v3 tag team fight.. *Dr. Doom and Storm came up 🤯
DOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND NO RDJ!!!!! Just epic Victor!!!!! I wanna have this!!!
This video randomly popped up and I m glad it did
Hopefully there’s an English dub, but other than it looks amazing!
Why are you doing this to me?  What's the hard part about doing a Marvel version of Injustice and not the constant anime style crap.  You have the potential and the ability to make a Civil War style Injustice game and you make this ?  Really pathetic.
They should change Ms.Marvels face, looks too 'lolish'.
Rocket says "Oh yeah!"
Only in PS5? Big Flop
why is this Japanese though
Where's Capcom? I'm not going to buy it if there's no Capcom in it
I never knew how much I needed muscle mommy Storm ❤
This looks amazing, i hope we get a big roster of characters we havent seen before in other fighting games, such as silver surfer, the sentry, namor, hercules, deadpool, knull... etc
It honestly sounds badass in Japanese
It's crazy how Disney is killing marvel on the big screen, but banger games keep getting released
I want to see Deadpool speaking Japanese ….
Marvel Minus Capcom
This and 2XKO. is this the start of Coop FGC? Im a casual at Fighting games.
Does this mean there's no MvC4 after all? Or are they gonna reveal the craziest crossover ever and squeeze the Capcom cast in there too? WHAT IS THIS?
That part at 2:45 Instant goosebumps
capcom? nah just marvel
Why does it seem like there is so much eastern influence behind marvel these days.. game still looks fun tho
bro peter saying Spidey Sense like its some anime move is so goofy i love it
Gundam Ironman
Please please please make English voice lines!
What in the DragonBallFighterZ is this I'm excited!!!
OMG
Mood instantly lifted. Thank you for this
Marvel is cooking these days. The games and movies are seeing a major jump in quality. Hyped to see it
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
So.... its just another MvC minus the C which is fine and all. Not gonna bother spending money on it. Will it strictly be Japanese and  can't we just get an Injustice style Marvel game. Like we have Civil War to work with. It's not a far  fetched. I just don't want to bother buying another MvC game.
i got one word is god dang this gonna be fun and chaotic
Can we all agree this creator deserves more recognition
That part at 2:45 Instant goosebumps
this game is like dragon ball fighterz
I was waiting like O.O to see if Doom uses Footdive.
I think this is better then Marvel vs Capcom right 👍
Take my money now
We might not see MVC in a while but I’m just happy we got another Marvel Fighting Game in Anime Form.
😮 marvel rivals  WASN'T anoth
Iron man looks like a gundam I love him 😭😭😭
This game looks so sick! I'm looking forward to see which characters we are going to play in this new fighting game!
I love MvC but im so happy we finally have our own Marvel only fighting game
The editing is top-tier. Seriously impressive
yooooooooooooooooooooooo
Marvel Minus Capcom
Capcom… where are you😢
I learned more in 10 minutes than hours of Googling
Waiting on the other X-Men announcements. Maybe some that haven’t been in a fighter before EG Kitty Pryde
Looks kinda slow
LETSGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FINALLLY!!!
I Think This is what it's meant by Love At First Sight! ❤🎉
8 characters then you gotta buy the rest that’s sick
This is going straight into my favorites playlist
I love everything I’m seeing! I can’t help but wish that One Piece would get a fighting game like this.
Japan doing Marvel better than USA
hype
Sadly not on xbox
As much as I wanted a new marvel vs capcom game  This still looks pretty good
I’m very happy about this just hope the characters don’t get stuck behind pay walls ❤
Please port this game for mobiles to 🥺🧐
This trailer just redefined 'super' in superhero.
LOOK AT THE MARVEL VS CAPCOM POTENTIAL CAN ALREADY SEE ITS GONNA GO THAT WAY DLC OR GAME  THEY BETTER PULL OUT ALL STOPS   BEFORE GTA 6 DROPS
Ух, а смотрится весьма сочно и фаново!)
Ugh. PS Studios.  Why Marvel? However much $ony is paying you is peanuts compared to what you are losing by not putting the game on Xbox and Switch.
You just earned a new subscriber
And mobile Users?
I hope the wall break keep fast as in the trailer, Wall break in Guilty Gear just few lame after some time.
I’m so hype for this!
Mood instantly lifted. Thank you for this
4 vs 4? PLEASE let it have as many characters as MVC2
Dragon ball fighterZ vibes❤
PUT CYCLOPS IN THIS GAME AND  MAKE ME BUY

Civil war...the anime! 😂
This looks awesome  We got two awesome marvel games with awesome art styles back to back
Why marvel heroes speak Japanys ? :DDD
Finally civil war 3
This looks extremely cool, like the old marvel vs capcom from 98 ps1
Please PLEASE have some sort of single-player content  I really want to play this game
THIS. IS. A. MAZING
This is going straight into my favorites playlist
Since they emphasize the variety of characters, can I expect Jagganaut this time? Or there are other big boy candidates?
We gonna need a Deadpool that hits you with your own health bar.  Not HIS health bar, YOURS.
Im actually in shock. We used to pray for times like these 😭
There's still going to be English right???  Not hating, jus wanna know what they be saying
I bet Spiderman gonna be so broken look at how broken he os in rivals
Your consistency is inspiring—keep going

That transition at 3:12 was chefs kiss
The Ironman looks like Gurren Lagann.
You just earned a new subscriber
You know, the design of these heroes gives me a mha-esque feeling. Like its horikoshi who designed it lol
Fighterz with marvel skin Hope They don’t have so much dlcs
Marvel rivals by netease and now THIS?! Yeah this def Marvel's time. Extremely interested to see how 4V4 will be handled.
*GHOST RIDER IN BASE ROSTER LFG!!!!*
They should've also added wolverine
This looks better than 2XKO ngl
Where is Doom,s foot dive...
Just hand development of their entire catalog of IPs to south East Asian gaming companies and let them cook.
Yeah this is gonna be LIT!!!!!
The editing is top-tier. Seriously impressive
😢Wow, I have an Xbox and I really wanted to play
it's Marvel's year... We're going to experience the prime of the franchise
This is going straight into my favorites playlist
Now THATS the real storm , sorry marvel rivals but that Mohawk ain’t it.
Am I the only one who found it similar to Dragon Ball FighterZ?
I. Can’t. Believe. My. Eyes. 😭😄we have been blessed.👏
I love the fighting game aspect of this. The tag team mechanic is just annoying.
Caramba
If this is f2p  2xko is back to being project L
Friendship ended with Marvel Rivals, now Marvel Tokon is my best friend
Ghost Rider is going to be a menace
Still cant believe something Marvel could look THIS frkn good. Arc are true wizzards.
That transition at 3:12 was chefs kiss
Years of me asking for Marvel nemesis rise of the imperfects 2 … I suppose this will do but it’s not on Xbox 😢
Is this free like marvel rivals?
The real question is whether, am I gonna buy another cool looking fighting game, knowing damm well I suck at fighting games and have pulled off a combo in any fighting game that wasn’t a arena fighter 😂
Sorry Capcom, you had your shot and you blew it with your remasters...
If you EVER played Tatsunoko vs Capcom this has the vibe and that game was HEAVILY slept on.
Ah yes, guilty gear x marvel
It gonna sell base off arc system work name alone.
so happy about this
I’m still trying to figure out which time line I’m in . . .
Your consistency is inspiring—keep going
Guess post arkham, Marvel has won their gaming foot back
When the coolest things to come out of Marvel in years is Rivals, and Fighting Souls, both made by eastern devs.  It’s a pattern now
Western devs could never.
If marvel vs capcom 4 looks anything like this, and not more like mvc2.....i am going to fease out,
Your consistency is inspiring—keep going
I learned more in 10 minutes than hours of Googling
GHOSTRIDERRRR
They’re gonna take us for a ride
Marverrruuuuu!
why Cap have Gojo voice ?!
I ve had this on repeat all day
You just earned a new subscriber
They were the comics, the movies and now it' time to the video game era!!!!.....enjoy before it end, cause it will  But i feel it s gonna be great for a while!!
So 4v4? The fantastic four better be base roster or i'll crash out
Maaaaan the animation style is chef's kissssss
Why is marvel being so anime-fied? Rivals and this.
Dragon ball fighterZ marvel edition
声優が豪華過ぎw

Espero pongan muchos más personajes y no tantos dlcs, por que sino va a costar un ojo de la cara
Mood instantly lifted. Thank you for this
Wait a minute...so this isn't coming out on xbox?
Im surprise to not see Wolverine yet
take my money
Coming for Riot Game's gig
haven't played a fighting game since T7. i might pick this up!
藤原啓治のモノマネできる人を起用してくれよ これじゃない感がすごい
Ms. Marvel is cute
This looks like a game so fun to play that I won't even mind losing every single time in a ranked match because the animations and sound effects are so friggin' lit.
Espero que nunca salga en Nintendo switch ni Xbox, porque por algo tengo PlayStation 5 🤨🤨
Capcom has left the building!
STORM INSTANT BUY ♥⚡︎⚡︎⚡︎⚡︎⚡︎⚡︎⚡︎
Another SOLD from Playstation Studios.
I was waiting for Marvel VS Capcom 4, but I'll take Marvel w/o Capcom
That part at 2:45 Instant goosebumps
Marvel fans are eating good
Why is this Japanese?
on switch 2?
Sí Marvel Rivals llamaba la atención este Juego lo hará también para gustarle a muchos(as) fans, por ejemplo si los americanos no respetarón a Miss Marvel los japoneses sí lo hicierón viéndose increíble con sus poderes.
Not on switch... seriously?😭
有幾多個角色？
The fact that they used the Doom gun sequence from the very very First Fantastic Four movie is the chefs kiss
Why didn't they put the Japanese Spider-Man? Like, he would be perfect for this game, besides he has a super cool mecha to use as a final attack
Thank you!!🙏🔥❤️
In 95, X-men Cota was so impressive, and every Marvel capcom game in the 90s was so crazy. This one seems dull, generic, annoying like soda water without bubbles.  Anyway ...
Is this game free?
Oh yeah 👏👏👏👏👏👏😎🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😔can’t wait for this game
Supaidah-Man skin when? Change Leopardon!!!
yeah but it's arcsys so wake me up when they never add rollback
ARC Sys being behind a Marvel fighting game.....makes so much sense. Can't wait.
I hope it will also be in English🙏
Il picchiaduro di cui non avevamo bisogno
Marvel vs capcom 5  Grandmaster final boss
Came for the thumbnail, stayed for the vibes
holy peak
looks cool but probably just another Street Fighter
Arc System Works!?! I‘m gonna put this on my List.
Im getting too old. 4 vs 4? Too chaotic for me
Why is doctor doom using a glock?
Arc System Works never disapoints...
You just earned a new subscriber
Sooooo, 2XKO but better?
To all the persian 🇮🇷 viewers  Pls tell me you read it the same way as I do 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mal começou e ja é melhor que o da riot
Is this a game that is just like injustice or Mortal Kombat, meaning can’t I play this solo, multiplayer or online?
Please add Cyclops. It's bad enough the leader of the X-Men isn't in Rivals yet!
Thank you Marvel, for once, you did the good thing! 😭
Capcom deserves this L
Can we all agree this creator deserves more recognition
Came for the thumbnail, stayed for the vibes
Is that an answer to that Riot Fighting game? 😂
I love it❤ when
Seiyuu(VA) i can confirm.... Spiderman = Shinji Kawada Captain america = Yuichi Nakamura(Same VA in MCU) Ghost rider =Katsuyuki Konishi Star Lord= Koichi Yamadera(Same VA in MCU) Storm= Miyuki Sawashiro  Ironman=Ryutaro Okiayu(not sure)
Marvel gaming fans are eating GOOD rn
Marvel been cookinggggggg def getting that beat em up game as well 🔥🔥
This looks tight, but signing exclusivity deals on your brand for videogames, when outside of gaming anyone can easily enjoy your creative output. It sucks. All my excitement for the his disappeared.
Aah yes, Japanese contest of champions.
I smell a DBFZ clone
I hope that marvel rivals still gets updated
Not bad, but not as good as Injustice.
Does DR Doom have the same VA as Akuma???
Please please have Sabertooth 1990s Comics version
Marvel meets anime energy? This is the crossover we didn’t know we needed. 🥋⚡🕷
Fireee
Y is it in japanese?
Another 2D fighting game lol
Marvel and Sony please find a compromise and bring this to Xbox and Switch 2
I need cap to say "STARS AND STRIPES"
I see you're still trying to make Miss Marvel a thing 😂
This looks amazing
Probably not Horikoshi.
A marvel game with Ghost Rider. Finally.
The Japanification of American properties peeves me.
They're gonna go with only one HP bar. At 0:44 you can see when the 'player's soul' leave Iron-Man body and goes into Spider-Man, seem like it will be the core mechanic of this game hence the name "Fighting Soul"
This is Marvel vs marvel
We still trying toake Ms Marvel a thing then eh 😅
1:03 Ore-sama no namae wa Staah-lodo  So cool!
so this is 2xko killer guys?
Sensacional, pls que seja free igual ao projeto L do LoL
An emissary from hell, SUPAIDAMAN!! I swear they need to get him to say that!!
They're some sort of rivals...
Unfortunate it's not a new marvel vs Capcom game but it still looks really cool! (Wake me up when a new MvC game comes out though 😴)
shut up and take my money! ワクワクするぜ❣
i prefer shonen jump fighterZ than marvel fighterZ
H F👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Look man, I’m happy for this and coping when it comes out BUT why can’t Arc Sytems do this with Naruto. 😭
😮😮😮
Civil War, anime style
Y Xbox Series X/S y Switch 2?
Well well WELL, we've got ourselves a legally distinct Marvel vs Capcom 4 with designs *possibly* from the My Hero Academia author? Boys and girls we have never been more back!!!!!
When i saw Arc System Works, i was already immensely grateful
TEKKEN ❌ TOKON✅
We got Tekken marvel before gta6😂
finally a new Marvel VS Capcom without Capcom
Nice
Marvel is always cooking 🔥🔥🔥
Why dont they relese a trailer and release the game next week whos gonna remember this game in 2026
I hope the base roster is humongous
One step closer to a new marvel anime…
一時期アークシステムワークスがSIEに買収されるって噂あったけどこれを作っていた事から噂に尾ひれがついたのか
Riot Project L is Cooked if this end up a free to play
Hopefully one day for FGO or gacha game
i thought capcom made this game
They're still trying to make Miss Marvel happen? That's the only blemish on this trailer.
Marvel FighterZ?  Im so in.  Gimme.
Peak
2xko hype leaving my body in real time
Very cool looking game.
The style is so saucy
God dayum
That's the x announcment of an marvel game😂
They're gonna go with only one HP bar. At 0:44 you can see when the 'player's soul' leave Iron-Man body and goes into Spider-Man, seem like it will be the core mechanic of this game hence the name "Fighting Soul"
This is HYPE!!! Does it mean no Marvel 4 tho?
Ironman Gundam hahahah
I'm bad at fighting games. I can't play 2v2 fighting games. 3v3 fighting games I can't even comprehend. 4v4 is ggs for me, I'll stick to Rivals.
Sounds cool... But, why put in this trailer that piece of trash called Miss Marvel?
It low-key looks like Dragon ball fightersz had a marvel mod
Will there be an emglish version
Gameplay look Fantastic, 4v4 game will be interesting.
Marvel Guilty Gear??????? Perfection
When i saw Ghost Rider i couldn't countain myself 💀🔥🔥😎
The gameplay looks really awesome and dynamic, but I hate the character design. They changed the design from their original comics to manga, and the Japanese voices don't suit them at all because the characters aren't Japanese, it looks too weird. Since when did Iron Man look like a gundam ? 🤦‍♀  I understand that this is marketing to attract more people because many people watch Japanese anime and like Japanese stuff 🤷‍♀
Arc Systems Works makes this an auto purchase after what they did for DBZ
This is gonna be big look at that artstyle and gameplay also need to see a big rosters for this game this look amazing!
return of maximum spider?
I feel like watching Marvel but My Hero Academia style, like the 3D anime stylized, Japanese Voice Actor Will it come to Steam?????
The only way I'm buying this is if there some form of simplified controls. Like SFV and Tekken have now. doing crazy buttom pressing with a dualsense sucks.
Where’s my boy scott summers?
Is it me or Doctor Doom has Akainu's voice?
I am Japanese but Iron Man is a terrible design.
The only question left is, does Doom still have his Footdive?
Will there be an english version?
Nah... Ghost Rider was terribly nerfed 😢
looking good
Ghost Rider looks great! This one’s gonna slap for sure
Amazing 😍!!!!!! All we need is Wolverine in the base roster,and it's gonna be perfect, hopefully there will be more skins to unlock.
Take my money
I already know I’m gonna main Spider man
Love Iron Man's design so much ❤
Dante Starlord 😮
everyone ganged up on spidey.. Poor soul
This looks good But will it last?
Put as many characters as possible. The X-Men. Fantastic Four. Hulk. Thanos. Galactos. Moon knight. Blah blah blah. You get it.
Thank you... THANK YOU. THAAAAAAAAAAANK YOU SOOOOOOOOOO MUCHHHHHHH... <3 💓💗💖💘🖤💕💞♥
Marvel Mugen Fighter2
This game will be on EVO, definitely 💯
Looks like Marvel vs Burger King
DOOM BASICALLY HAS MISSILES
This Game Mechanics 2018 Dragon ball Fighterz game diffrent
Just like arcade days .
MARVEL IS ALWAYS COOKING WITH THE GAMES FR
PS4 canot play :(
GAW DAYUMMM!!!!!
feels same as figherZ. Dr doom looks amazing so does the game.
I need it!!!❤❤
OK so after the disappointment of MvsC Infinity,Marvel was like "What if we give rights to Arc System who has the best fighting games and give an anime - japan style to our heroes"?Let ME tell you:You have the best fighting game of the last 5-10 years!!!
Marvel Super Heroes successor
Why is it anime
boring
When Marvel VS Guilty Gear X??? Or Marvel VS Arc System Works???
So excited for this 🎉
First marvel rivals now this, y’all seem to be wining
This is great and kinda sad at the same time. This game looks absolutely amazing and fun and its great to see a new marvel fighting game. Also it shows once again that eastern game companies do a much better job with marvel than western companies. However its sad because this means that Marvel Vs Capcom will likely never see a new installment. Also PlayStation is involved in it so it will never come to xbox or switch 2. They probably did this on purpose since Sony has a history of blocking games from coming to other platforms.
it is like : Dragon ball fighter z
I hope they have the same tag Mode like skullgirls 2nd encore,  where you can decide how many members are in your team.
Something about captain America speaking Japanese is hilarious.
Llámenme loco, pero la verdad no me emociona mucho que digamos
Marvel vs Capcom, sans Capcom
1:20 THEY JUMPIN ME!!!!
This looks amazing
Man these character designs are wicked!! Why does Cap look so much cooler in a jacket?!! 😎
Just don't give IPs to western devs with pronouns and you'll be fine
Arc System Works is a great fighting game company. If you want to check out one of their best games, try BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle. It’s a massive crossover between BlazBlue, Persona 4 Arena, Under Night In-Birth & RWBY. It was awesome.
Why oh why do they drag ms marvel into everything.  She’s not popular. She will never be popular. She has the same powers as mister fantastic and most ppl would much prefer him over her. I just don’t get it.
Stanley wouldn't like his creations fighting each other
Xbox and switch got hoed
0:06; 0:14 Hearing Yuichi Nakamura as Cap once again is like meeting an old friend. 0:38 Same VA of Kamala in the previous Avengers game. 0:44 My bad, it's Shinji Kawada aka Spidey from Marvel Disk Wars, not EnoJun.  0:58 Is that you, Yamadera-san? Star-Lord once again? 1:09 So Ghost Rider is basically Tatsumi Oga with actual powers from Hell. 😂 1:23 Dang, they got Severus Snape's Japanese VA as Doom! 1:33 Meanwhile, Baby Berubo as Storm.
REAL QUESTION: WILL THIS BE REGION LOCKED IN PC JUST LIKE EVERY PS RELEASE AFTER HELLDIVERS?
Nice. Now where’s the English version?
Capcom be like: Remember, the first and only reality of the sith. There can only be two, and you are no longer my apprentice.
ARCSYS  PUT DAREDEVIL IN AND MY WALLET IS YOURS
now we need one piece fighter Z
"Doom summons... gun !"
where's the fantastic 4? where's reed, ben, johnny, and sue???
First, Marvel Rivals and now this one ! So glad the East is saving the super hero genre in videogames ! (United States seems unable to do it now)
insane! That's true!! Love it!
Hope they will not forget to have both tech AND magic for Doom.
Nice 👍🏿
Looks like Dragon ball fighters Z
This instead of a bp game or an actual GOOD singerplayers story? Mortal Kombat/Streetfighter type games are a niche genre. I think this is gonna flop.
I thought Enoki Junya returned back his role as Spiderman??
Iron man Gundam!? 0:27
Marvel FighterZ
:)
I bet it’s before GTA 6
Dc fanboys crying😂
I made up my mind, you'll be coming with me😎
Finally! No more CRAPCOME CRAP!
Why not the original japanese spiderman?
This looks AMAZING!!! I need this now!
Inspired choice. Arc Systems are much closer to 90s Capcom style than modern Capcom are.
What’s a tokon?
Storm looks gorgeous! ❤
Noice!🎉❤
Once i saw Arc System pop up on screen. Wishlist instantly!
Is that some Kind of  Civil war  between marvel  games
It has a dragon ball fighterZ vibe
Finally cartoon graphics making a comeback. I’ll take it. I love 2D artwork but this is next gen 2D look with 3D engine. Beautiful. Day one purchase for me.
ms marvel looks adorable
....🥱 can we just leave marvel alone and you know....let arc systeems work on a ONE PIECE FIGHTING GAME!
No 1978 Japanese Supaida-man, I'm devastated. The opportunity is right there.
Marvel has such a good taste on choosing the appropriate studios for the games they make
Now this looks fire 🔥 😍
💪🏿🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 j'adore déjà ce jeux 🎉
This is basically an avengers civil war game, amazing
カッコいい
MAHVEL BAYBEE
Theres a severe lack of “FOOTDIVE”
Sorry Ali G, east side is clearly the best
arc system works animation <3
Why you guys glazing? This looks super cheap 👎
you know it's authentic marvel when spidey's getting his ahh beat by everybody
Thanks but no thanks
why do marvel hate xbox players so much 💔
Mfs at Arc system works really saw the gold mine Capcom was sitting on and said "Fine, i'll do it myself."
...Does this mean we could get some Persona crossover characters with this game?         Also, probably a stupid question, but...what are the chances this could come to Switch 2?
Kamen Rider Ironman was not something i thought i needed. But for some reason, i NEED IT NOW.
Is this only on playstation or is it in pc too
Why do i hear DIO
arc system works
I’d appreciate a marvel vs capcom game…
4 vs 4 looks plus ultra fun
incrível
Arc Systems Works.... yeah, this game is in good hands
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
The next step is: marvel ultimate hero storm 😂😂
Now this is innovation in the tag fighting genre!
I can’t wait for my character reveals. Give me Hulk and it’s OVER!!!
We can't stop winning ^^
Arc system works 🔥🔥🔥
Yo quiero el Marvel va Capcom 4
2xko is dead on arrival
4v4 is pushing the envelope. Those matches are gonna run looonnnnng!
You can always trust the east to make a good game
Tempestade está linda
So cancelled black panther to give us this… passssssssss
What will happen to Marvel vs Capcom?
MvC3 still looks better... that'll be a no for me
This drops with Dr. Doom, I'll most likely give it a shot. Doom is awesome
tag system looks like fighterz with an extra character tag assist avaliable, is this the case arc nerds?
Amazing!
At launch probably only going to have 12 characters.
Ahh time to bust out the spidey/war machine combo after all these years
スパイダーマンの声優アニメの人！？！？だったら懐かしすぎる！！！
Marvel Games better than Dc
Daisy Johnson pwease😭
This could count as a Marvel Super Heroes 2 except it wasn't made by Capcom. I expect good things of this game. Take your time, and thank you Marvel Japan.
Marvel, stop trying to make Ghost Rider happen.
Eyeporn. This looks so goooooooood
It's Arc System Works and you already know the game is good.
This is interesting
i don't like this captain america suit  I like the OG comic style Captain America more. Or the captain america on Marvel vs Capcom.
Insane.
FINALLY! Marvel Blazeblue
DC has to wake up asap
DB Fighterz but Marvel character
Movies have been trash probably cuz they're putting everything into gaming....im not mad
Can I get cable magneto and sentinel to go with that doom plz
This is exactly the closest we’ll ever get to a Marvel vs Capcom 4. Even if it’s just Marvel characters themselves. This looks hella awesome
Looks alright, but an easy pass.
Basically a Marvel game that plays just like Dragon Ball Fighter z
Sorry Marvel but will it also be released for Xbox in the future?
There's just something about spider-man yelling "Spidey-SENSE!" Right when he kicks someone
Too slow for me
Marve+anime=cringe^2
Next Marvel Game: open world Iron Man man 😮‍💨
4v4? Anime-inspired Marvel Game? From the guys that brought Guilty Gear: Strive, Marvel Rivals, Marvel Contest of Champions, Marvel's Avengers and more? I am so down for this!
MAXIMUM SPIDER!
Watch Out Mortal Kombat 1, an even BETTER Fighting game is coming out!
Capcom: hey Bandai, can we replace the letter E?
Please for the love fighting games ARCS no wall break mechanic in this one I beg you
It feels like Dragon BAll Fighterz with marvel characters. Sounds good.
Cant wait to see LowTearGod get washed on this 😂
MARVEL MINUS CAPCOM
Someone's getting a raise after adding Dr von doom
There should b an event of Avengers vs X Men
4v4? This has potential to be harder than Skullgirls
Wow
2XKO never had a chance...
Fantastic art style
hell nah
ドゥームの声かっけぇぇぇぇぇえ！！！！！！！
COOLEST STARLORD DESIGN ON GOD  Iron mans is very mecha too. At first I didn't like but now I love it. As much as I can a fighting game (which I do not play at all)
Marvel please make trading card not a game but collectibles one
Yo Marvel, thank you very much for the video. I hope to see Morrigan Aensland ! 🦇
Looks like Street Fighter mod made by some Marvel fan
We've gone full circle from My Hero Academia looking like Marvel to Marvel looking like My Hero Academia.
Looks like dragon ball fighters
ブリキだぞおめぇ
オロロンちょちょパァ
4v4 looks kool
Is this real or a fan thing
This is what happens when my hero academia meets up with marvel universe
first overwatch now street figher, marvel's cooking hard
Who is the publisher?
I swear I remember captain america: civil war differently
I pray for moon knight 🙏🏽
Who’s here in 2025? 🤔
4 vs 4?! That's insane. 😮
1:14 DAREDEVILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
De por si Fatal Fury esta muerto, ahora mas con esto ~
arcsys at it again.
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
llevamos 40 años viendo el mismo tipo de juego. Con personajes de todas las franquicias del mundo, ya cansa (me lo compro de salida)
Goodness! Golly! Gracious!  Also, yay! Ghost Rider!
Dragon ball fighter z?
Captain America with Gojo Satoru voice is awesome ❤
Anyone else get the vibes of guilty gear? Something about the movement, weight and animations was screaming it to me; that and, obviously, marvel vs capcom.
Iron man has some parts they clearly reference it them from somewhere hmmmm wonder where
If there's english voices, I really, REALLY hope that they get Josh Keaton back for Spider-Man. No offense to Yuri Lowenthal. I just really wish Disney would get Josh as Spider-Man for something.
WHERE'S IRONFIST? WHERE'S 气贯长虹？
I do hope there's an epilepsy friendly button in setting
Arc system deciding to make guilty just reskinned with marvel characters
So… it’s Guilty Gear reskinned with Marvel Characters?
Looks Like Marvel vs capcom without capcom
I swear bruh dc always behind but what’s new dc needa step up man I’m so tired giving these dudes chances
Now this looks good.
MARVEL FIGHTERZ PEAK!!!
Finally Marvel FighterZ
SUPIDA MAAN  🔥🔥
Please marvel don’t cancel this please 🙏
YES! This looks so good - Arc System Works don't miss!!
I used to pray for times like these 😭🤲🏾
so marvel vs capcom without capcom
Loki - “My debut will be glorious!”
Perfect!
I need this soundtrack now
It probably the first time i saw a 4v4 style fighting game
Most epic reveal so far. Thank you Marvel for making this game!
I’m gonna need to see my daredevil and gambit in here
\o/
This game looks awesome! It kind of gives me Rival Schools vibes!❤
I’ve waited all my life for a new UMVC3
If it comes out with Maxxxing Gooning activated it's going to be a total success.
i waiting to buy 💵
I'm actually reminded of the MUGEN Spider-Man when he did the Spider Sense auto dodge
🔥🔥🔥
I want that Figuarts Iron Man!
I’m sorry did doctor doom just pull a block on ghost rider
lowkey fire
ARC SYSTEM MARVEL FIGHTING GAME LEZZ GOOOOOO
Never been excited for a year in my life like I am for 2026
I do hope we get a decent roster. Need to have Thanos, Apocalypse, Sabertooth as playable characters
evo marvel era is back, let's go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
shouldve been a 2v2 or 3v3 at most, but ill take it :D
why there is no blood effects?
The game in one word, amazing.
bring justice to square enix avengers.
10 years later, we should hopefully see Sol Badguy fighting Cap
Looks like Arc System works strikes again But 2026?! I mean Come on man😓
Fainlly a Marvel fighting game
Bueno Marvel vs Marvel. Una pena que un MVC no sea posible actualmente imagina uno hecho por ASw como este
Finally...."Marvel AvengerZ"
_fake Ms. Marvel gets beaten up_ *[ Everyone liked that ]*
This... is... AWESOME!!!!!!!
IM SO EXCITED! LOOKS SO PRETTY!
Dragon ball fighters with marvel character, i like it
the pleasure to see how spidey is getting reckt when you know how annoying he is in rivals
Boring game type duel fighting , i thoug marvel will launch new rpg hack & slash story campaign with all hero 😢
Please give me venom so i can jump mfs with his as spidey
Dragon Ball FighterZ
Looks horrible
Where is Wolverine?!  Also I hope is has a dope single player mode.
THERE BETTER NOT BE AUTO COMBO STRINGS
Marvel’s gaming department owns the whole kitchen with how they have been cooking with their recent games.   Also, close enough. Welcome Dragon Ball Fighters Z.
2XKO dead game?
Still waiting for injustice 3 button
Looks like marvel vs capcom and db fighterz had a child... And it looks awasome!
Rip project L
Looks great i hope they make more characters
shounen  grab your job stick we have fights to be won
1:54 lore accurate peter parker
WHERE IS DR DOOM FOOTDIVE
Very similar to 2XKO. But rito announced their games in 2020 and it still doesn't even have a release date, marvel releases it a year after the announcement
If only Overwatch got the same love…
Ghost rider
no way they put the avengers in guilty gear
Would’ve preferred a DC crossover, but I’m hyped nonetheless
If it was a random dev, I wouldn’t get this, but archsystems Instant but
Dr Doom better get a Foot Dive move.
Riot is so doomed!
ん？なんで日本語？
this is literally history, i dig japanese spiderman
Only good game in the entire showcase.
That game… lookin… so nice… So so very nice. This might easily stomp UMvC 3.
FOOT DIVE
A bunch of popular Marvel characters...... and Kamala Khan.
Okay, this is fire, but why the random pistol for Doctor Doom? 😂
Someone has definitely been going over the old Vs games with a keen eye.  My inner child is literally foaming at the mouth in anticipation. 😊
DC gave us Injustice, Marvel gives us... this
Finally a perfect Marvel fight
Finally! Another turn based rpg fighting game!
Gonna take a while for the MvC muscle memory to stop kicking in once I play this.
Not on Xbox? I guess ill have to force myself not to care about another Marvel game yet again.
Another massive W for  Marvel x Eastern Devs This looks fantastic!
LOVE IT
I think we have a new age of Marvel. Its video games instead of movies!
I really want to play this. It is like playing Dragon ball FighterZ
I swear, the way these people act, you'll think Storm is the ONLY black person in the entirety of Marvel Comics
Yikes to the Xbox players
we need green goblin
We got Guilty Gear for straight people before GTA 6
It looks like MARVEL version of DRAGON BALL Z FIGHTER Z 😮
Rather play marvel rivals
Marvel IP with Arc Sys talent and playstation money backing it. Oh this is going to be special
Why ms marvel though??😂
Marvel guilty gear!?
Utterly stunning on every aspect 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Great. After all the years we've been demaning a game featuring the XMEN, were finallly gettng a Marvel fight game.🙄🙄🙄😑😑 Well...at least they didn't white wash Strom's skin color, so I guess I'll take the wins where I can get them. 😒😒
Guilty Gear Marvel goes hard 🔥
ill buy aslong as there is   W O L V E R I N E
Yo this looks wild!
Arc is the best studio for this game and it's not even close.  The movement in the game kinda looks a little like Guilty Gear and DBFZ. The art style looks mad fire. Very hyped
Cautiously optimistic, the game falls with the gameplay, the story and the single-player mode (and no: story, arcade, training and gallery mode are not included, that's standard). BlazBlue Central Fiction and TekkenTag Tournament2 had more single players than Guilty Gear Strive and Guilty Gear XRD or Tekken 7 and Tekken 8.
Ojalá metan a Gambit o Cyclops, que son los que más usaba en MvC. Se que no se jugarán igual pero bueh.
Sugoi.
2:03 - These close ups are a masterpiece
Ah, I remember how Cap said: 私は自由のために戦う
Ok I’m gonna make a wish list right here.    Wolverine  Hulk Ultron Venom Blade Deadpool Daredevil She-Hulk Doc Ock Lockjaw  I feel the Fantastic 4 would be in a “4V4” game especially if Dooms in it. But I can see some unique designs of these iconic characters.
Wihhh tawurann kyk SNK
Not Sony paying again for a temporal exclusivity so people will forget they have no reason to buy a PS5.
You guys are killing it with marvel games this year and next!!
Marvel tryna go crazy. Rivals, now this too???
If they Dub this in English, Please let Yuri Lowenthal dub Spider-Man 🙏 🙏 🙏
I used to dream for times like this, bro…
LOL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love how recognizable the arcsys style is
bye bye marvel rivals, this is my new game
0:46 SPIIIIIDER-MAAAN DAAAA SPIDEY SENSEEEE 🕸
Marvel vs Marvel
DNF Duel : Marvel Edition
Oh, finally we have *Supaidāman*!!!
RIP 2XKO. Its Marvel time!
I actually like it!
Looks playable :D
I need this.
If Wanda is in it I’m putting atleast 100 hours into this game
I hope it's just not the character shown in the trailer cuz that's like a super small roster
Everything is better in Japanese
Shut up and take my fight money 😭
i hope its free
ASIAN STUDIOS IS THE ANSWER
DOOM'S WALK ANIMATION DUDE I CAN'T
Coming in 2026 this has to be some form of mental torture like I can’t wait that long it looks too cool and fun
Really , another 2D Fighting game?
My boy said this was Marvel Minus Capcom. 😭
🤩🤩
So this is Marvel Fighterz
I've literally yesterday thought about "Why didn't we get any Marvel fighting after Marver vs Capcom?" and there it is!
Please don't simplify this game down to hell, it has so much potential, even if I am sad we aren't getting Capcom on this
Capcom watching from the chair in the corner of the hotel room
2XKO crying in the corner 😅
Xbox ?
Почему герои американских комиксов базарят на японском будто в аниме? :)
leave it to the Japaneses to make a good marvel fighting game
Perfect game for a Japanese spiderman alt skin
Can't wait for the shenanigoons videos... also rip MvC
i'll be honest, this looks like an april fool's joke
please do a storymode!!! <3
This is glorious. This is why I’m loyal to PlayStation
Absolute peak  絶対ピーク
The final nail in the MvC Coffin...
1:54  why they jumping my boy😢😂
Where is my GOAT Jeff the Landshark❓🔥  (or at least Magik, please)
Oh yeah 2026 Kool that gives you time to work on the name👀
I guess we can all agree that at the end of the day dragon ball fighter Z was a huge success has a fighting game, that every studio wants a fighters variant.
we dont need another street fighter game
This is like the Marvel's take on fighterZ
We are so back
Yes. Just.. yes. 😁
alright no need to tell me it's arcsys, I can tell
It looks like Storm actually uses Rachel Alucard's Sylpheed (wind manipulation) at 1:41 PLEASE TELL ME THAT SHE HAS OMNIDIRECTIONAL WIND CONTROL!!
Avenger asenberu
Where is the footdive
Throw some Capcom in here and we got a game.
Yes
Please add Emma Frost and Magik!
Looks great. I hope Blade is playable.
Injustice for kids?
Why Ironman became a Gundam..?
no way we got spaidama and ghoosto rydaaa
im so tired of ip based media.  so weak.
PLS ADD CAPCOM BACK!!!! I MISS MARVEL VS CAPCOM!!!!!!!
At least dc has dark legion😢
Where's the FOOT DIVE ??!!??
우리들이 원하는게 이런 퀄리티라고 바로 이거다.
0:17 Why is there red Gundam  sensei ?
Literally just dragonball fighterz bro Where’s the innovation
This it strays too far from the classic designs ... It is for anime/mecha enthusiasts and may appeal to fans in Japan and Asia but not to Marvel fans in the West. Some may like the "Gundam Iron Man", but it is not for me ... even though I love Gundam.
Star lord’s moves look a little similar to another dual welding trench coat wearing character
spiderMANA ............. SPIDEY SENSEEE
Now if they could just remove ms marvel and quit acting like she has a fanbase that would be nice.
Marvel tokon ❤😮
FightersZ with Marvel characters, yeah take my money
Finally a new side screen fighting game for me to buy and suck at
This going to take mk spot for top3 FG😂
Storm looking like a snack
Eh. I’ll stick with rivals.
Lindíssimo!
First overwatch and now smash bros I like this
doom is just Aura farming with that walk
Hope there’ll be single player story mode, just like in Injustice, just fighting is pretty lame
Finally picking the right studios to do marvel games that are Asian company’s
والله تونس
MS MARVELLLLLL LETS GOOOOOOOO
There was a time when I used to say to myself that arc sys should make a DBFZ like contest of champions. I can die peacefully now
Dragon ball fighter z but marvel  Street fighter but marvel  Tekken?? But marvel  Marvel rivals
開発を委任されたＡＲＣＳＹＳＴＥＭの社員たちは 「capcomvsmarvel１と2」を徹底的に研究しました！ の熱が画諷にあらわれとるなああああ。(^_^;)
> Kamala Kahn enters the stage > Spiderman immediately enters and kick the ever living crap out of her  What did Arc System mean by that?
High jump mechanics again where you can't see your underneath. DBZ fighterZ reskin
I hope it will me hook totally like Marvel rivals ❤
Ghost rider is in it im insta buying that 🗣️🔥
Bro I watched this 100 times!
Yo!! This would go crazy on EVO
Star lords Special is just Dantes Level 1.
Tokkon not tekken
Me when black panther game got cancelled : 😢😢😢 Me when this game announced: 😊😁😊
IT'S MAHVEL BABY!!!
Cool
If they don't add Shang-Chi to a fighting game.....
Arc system works for the win
I’m getting this if Dormmammu is in the game
what are the odds they add capcom characters to these
DAM!! I’VE BEEN DREAMING Finally Please add more characters, need Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver and Magneto already🥹 BEGGING
Rivals and tokon has to collab and share skins with each other
Ohhhh 😮😮😮
Where’s Mega Man
I liked the japanime vibe, and some lesser-known characters too. Hopefully the roster fills nicely with heroes who haven’t gotten time to shine, especially some of the new ones from House/Powers of X.
BRING BACK CHARLES XAVIER AS A FIGHTING GAME CHARACTER PLS AND MY MONEY IS YOURS
Development by the team who made Dragonball FighterZ
Its looks like DragonBall Fighter Z  :( A bit boring, Marvel Rivals is more satisfying.
I hope the new DC movie and shows will be all bangers CUZ MARVEL IS NOW WINNING AT GAMES AND IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE😊
Pls give us wolverine
Dont forget wolverine!
SUPAII!!! DAAA!! MAAANO!!!!
Marvel games backstabbing Riot Games fighting game
RIP 2XKO
I’ll buy it
I only have one question WHAT THE HELL IS DC DOING
So like... Why is it Japanese 💀
Since this is a game from arc system works, I wonder if they will include goku in the game files just like in guilty gear
another trash tag game
I said it back then and I’ll say it again: No X-Men no buy. Storm is a good start, but I want Psylocke, Rogue, Phoenix, Cable, Cyclops, Jubilee, Wolverine, the whole team. And of course Magneto, Juggernaut, Omega Red, etc. Bring back the X-Men franchise!
So basically this is Marvel vs Capcom but just Marvel only
Guilty Gear под маской Marvel, Arc System если бы нормально занимался лором и прислушивался к фанатам, то не пришлось бы заниматься подобным.
Looks like a mobile game.
Gojo as Cap 😂
Can we please have some diversity in the roster, in every Marvel game the base roster is the exact same
please, add the steam page already, i want to wishlist this beauty!!!!
Leave it to eastern devs to make Marvel look awesome again
It’s like marvel dragon ball fighters… please be on steam
Hm that was amazing band new fighting is marvel tokon fighting souls in japan 4V4 tag team up old characters also I wish band new character is Black Cat, Daredevil, Typhoid Mary, and Iron-Fist, added coming soon 2026 so hype and I miss MVC fan.
Gameplay is ok, I was never a huge fan of arcsys games. But hte voice acting is 10/10
my boy spidey gets hit from every hero showed in this trailer , he is a tank , thats why he is called a goat 😭🗿
Nerd spider man again
We are so back.
OMG NEEEEED! But PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do English dubs!!!
Capcom looking at itself in the mirror this morning with cold realisation where they went wrong and what could have been
Marvel if you guys add Deadpool to both this and marvel rivals I swear all my money is yours
Sonunda ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I know one thing this game better have dormammu.. I’m trying to burn the tender 😏🔥🔥🔥
SPIIIDEY-SENSE!
HELLO?? Can we get some ART BOOKS?? The animation is amazing, looks so good!
Marvel vs ArcSys would be way better
Do you like Injustice ?! TAKE THIS !!! Marvel Tokon !!
When I saw the "Arc System Works" logo, my interest peaked out immediately.
I wasn't expecting to be pulling up with a literal glock
i get to play as fing ghost rider.... sold
Is this for real if so thank god I was getting tired of marvel rivals overwatch players ruined that game
Marvel without Capcom ? Dang !
japanese voices make everything better
At first I thought this was a Tekken crossover but I was caught off guard when I realised this was a pure Marvel fighting game.
Ngk this js so tuff i love there designs there full blown anime my fav is definitely Star-Lord and Iron man he looks like something out of gundam or Envangalion.
japanese dub marvel is something I didn't know I needed
can you make a fighting game like tekken its better 3D
“Can you make Marvel vs Capcom 5 but take out all that annoying Capcom stuff?🤗”
who ever keeps coming up with these game ideas please dont stop this is top gonna a crazy game to play
Paylocke better be here eventually
Where's Cable?!
Doom & Ghost Rider are so badass
Wow, can’t wait for Yipes to comment this 🎉
Marvel is cooking good on video games
I’m sure there’s not enough competition in the 2d fighter genre so this will really take off!    Idiotic release, this game will be dead within the year it releases.
Woooo switch game
MADE BY ARCSYS??  Oh this game is gonna be HYPE
In 4 years when they have the complete editions i will totally buy it!
Why do they keep dropping 2d fighters? Give us another marvel nemesis already.
So is it just marvel characters or what
If you guys gonna put Iron Fist, please be the og Iron Fist aka Danny Rand
MARVEL Fighterz
Que seja o msm sistema de combo do mortal Kombat, não aguento mais negócio de meia lua e esse sistema que nem do street
GUNDAM IRONMAN!!! I REPEAT, GUNDAM IRONMAN!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
You know it's not made by murrican  when the character aren't ugly
Looks great despite the lack of Dr. Doom foot dives.
Don't let Disney mess this up!!
Captain America: Yuichi Nakamura  Iron Man: Yoshihisa Kawahara  Star Lord: Koichi Yamadera  Storm: Miyuki Sawashiro  Ms Marvel: Honoka Kuroki  Spider-Man: Shinji Kawada  Ghost Rider: Tomokazu Seki  Doctor Doom: Takaya Hashi
The coolest reveal of the State of Play, but... the biggest betrayal to Capcom :(
Visually looks amazing.
ok so fighter Z had a baby with Capcom finally 😅🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Glorious.
Even in this game spidey is a menace
Mad respect to Arc and Marvel that no leaks whatsoever happened around this game.  Looks crazy, I hope it plays great, but Arc System Works rarely misses.
this is Marvel x tekken or street fight😂
looks great but isn't 4v4 just too much? i thought 3v3 is perfect
Sooooo, we're NOT getting another Marvel vs Capcom? 😅
why are they speaking japanese?
This is Marvel VS Capcom 4 without the Capcom
Dragon ball Fighterz vibes
0:49 ah, yes, the famous Spider-Man named attack "Spidey-sense" Makes total sense, just like Morbing out by Morbius.
We need marvel vs dc
My dream game was finally released
a yes  PS slop
This looks so good! I'll miss MvC though for fighting as Amaterasu.
Feels like Dargonballz than marvel😅
Marvel -vs. Capcom- 4gets Capcom
Ms. Marvel…?….really…?…. She needs to go, give me Psylock, Jean Gray, Wasp, Scarlet Witch. Just not Carol Danvers. She’s toxic
Dragonball Fighter Z in Marvel version.
Yay new Ms. Marvel content!!!!! This will be the coolest thing ever until they release the game for 80$ and then each new character as dlc for 20$
spiderman calling his move "spidey senses"
YEAH!!!!
where is wolverine ? venom ? gambit ? !!!!
1:20 ブリキだぞおめぇ！
let capcom make something
This is  CAPCOM producer, Right?
So the question has to be asked, when's Marvel vs. ArcSys?
Wazzler?
ArcSys and Marvel?! it's insane!
American Anime
This game needs to be on ALL plateforms with crossplay, don't do same error than DB FighterZ!
Star Lord whipping out the dualies like he's Deadpool... If Doctor Doom doesn't have FOOT DIVE I'll lose my mind.
Arc System Works is PEAK!!!
Can't wait to play this!
This gameplay gives me Marvel VS Capcom vibes,for animation it gives Marvel Disk Wars The Avengers and Marvel Rivals vibes
Spiderman yelling every attack reminds me of the tokusatsu Supaidaman 😢
This is db fighterZ but with marvel characters 🤣
Take my money!!! ....... But I really hope for alternative costumes... if customizable even better
Oh thank the gods, I was afraid there were no mutants until I saw Storm!
I already know I'm going be so bad at this game 😭
Man why cant they stick to more comic accurate character designs
Please have a Capcom DLC later on
If they add English voices, I hope they bring back the EMH actors and actresses
In love❤
Somebody clearly borrowed from Capcom...
Spidy sense sound so cute
The fighting roster will be lit. What character do you wanna see  appear in it?
BROOO PLZ TELL ME THIS IS MARVEL VS CAPCOM MARVEL ONLY EDITION… bro I love the game mechanics of MVC bro
i am happy we live in a universe that got this 🙏🏽🙏🏽 thank you human evolution for leading us up to this hype  that Iron Man better come in white, red & yellow (or custom colors), im going straight Op. V on everyone 🤖🤖
With the honeymoon phase for Marvel Rivals over for me and hadn’t been playing much but still interested, seeing Marvel having a new game on the way reeled me back in to the hype for a upcoming Marvel game again
And there goes my savings
This looks great to play offline not online because of all the combos you can do that never ends this game is for sweats not for casual gamers
DC FIGHT BACK
Well played marvel
A fight game like this needs the Ragin Cajun monami
Love the character designs. Much better than Rivals.
Where’s yo curly moustache at?!
japan marvel
Im gonna cry
Take my money
Switch 2 release pleases 🙏
Iron Man with a Gundam visor is something I didn't know I needed
Xbox plsssssss🥲
Proper spiritual successor to Marvel Super Heroes.
For his neutral special, Doom wields a gun
Capcom vs marvel🎮 is far better 👌
My soul can not fathom the greatness of this preview
Street Fighter: Marvel Edition
UMM feels like dragon ball FighterZ
This is too similar to DBFZ
You know I’mma bout to be a doom main
Quite interesting they are picking Robbie Reyes instead of Johnny, but its a welcome one!  For now it looks good, and the roster seems promising lets seee what the mecanics could be with a 4v4 format
marvel street fighter
I HAVE BEEN BEGGING FOR THIS since INJUSTICE 2
Holy this is gonna go crazy 🔥
Fresh ❤
I’m so happy on em gee
RIP my hopes for MvC4 :') this looks great though. I hope they add Cyclops and Strange.
Marvel Games has been COOKING recently, like tell the other one's gaming division to get it's crap together cuz THIS IS FIREEEEE
So this game is like a street fighter game but the marvel version, hmm worth waiting for the official release schedule.
iron man x gundam
Arc System Works new game!! sold!!! I love it
Notice how Spider-Man is the most beaten.
they got both legacy characters for ms marvel and ghost rider but not for spider-man is crazy to me my boy miles needs some clout
Technically this was already a game but now it's reborn as a nee
IS STAR LORDS VA THE SAME AS JOSEPH JOESTAR?
CLEEAAAAAN!!!
ARC SYSTEM !!! GOAT ! ! !
YES ANOTHER MARVEL GAME
Clean!
Playing as all the Fantastic Four is going to be amazing
Dude, that Star-lord VA is omg
Street fighter marvel is amazing
Dr.doom con un chumbo en la cintura
This is insane
Wow Mahhhvel anime fighters genius who thought of this. Cap with that jacket drip and that is not Ironman that is Gundman. I hear Yuichi Nakamura voicing Cap if I'm hearing it correctly. Perfect time to dive back in FGC, wishing for Scott Summers and Iron Fist
A worthy opponent for injustice!
Bruh this game is gonna go craaaaazy. What excellent stuff to wake up at.
They better add FANTASTIC FOUR in the FOUR character tag team battle game
I still can't believe this is a real game that really exists.  Incidentally, the last time I said that about a fighting game was Dragon Ball FighterZ.
the emesarry of death spaidermaaan
When I saw arc sys I burst like a missile. Imagine if we get the japanese spiderman in this☠️☠️☠️
If it's free definitely playing for sure
Dragon Ball AvengerZ
ITS DB FIGHTERZ BUT MARVEL AND IM ALL FOR IT
Please tell me spiderman has a giant mech and a tommy gun!
Marvel Vs Capcom Vs DC Please 😊
🔥💯🔥
Star lord being my favorite Marvel Character, him being Confirmed ay the same time as Spider man means I already have 2/4 of my main team 😂😂😂
LITERAL GOOSEBUMPS BRUHH!!!!
Wow.. this is cool..
I can't wait for the ultimate edition to add Vergil.
It's not Marvel vs Kellogs but i will take this
Marvel vs Capcom was starting to look terrible this is a step up.
I love this game baby
ohh this is nice!!!!
4v4 is absolutely insane. I expect nothing less from arcsys
Cool I can wait to Play it 😃😃
Iron Man's suit looks so mecha with that V
Marvel vs Capcom: Infinite will be nothing but a bad dream!
Japan makes everything better ❤
1:52 my hero got jumped :(
Like Dragonball Fighther Z
This looks good. Any chance there are English voices?
I love Mortal Kombat, I love Marvel. I don’t love this, there’s way too much going on for me
So Starlord is just a re-skin of Dante from MVC 3?
Oh yea Robby representation
❤😊😮. Marvel vs Marvel capcom Street Fighter Style. This is epic cool 😎 and Great video too ❤😊. And mugen game too just different.
Marvel vs No Capcom
ÀRC SYSTEM WORKS THOSE ARE MY FRICKEN BOYS
when Marvel games are better than movies xD
Arc System Works Cooking!!!!
when's mahvel?  NOW'S MAHVEL
0:58 Dante..?!?! Is that you?!?! 😂
I'll be there no matter what
nah dr doom pulling out a revolver is crazy
うおおおおキャップの声！！
If it’s 4 v 4 it needs a roster of 60 make it 69 😂
Marvel Rivals has a competition now. I would even say, it has found its marvel rival
os cara percebeu q é só fazer jogo minimamente bom q vende ?
when we combo 4 characters, should we call it Happy New Year?
I hope we get some more traditional skins but this looks incredible. I always wanted a decent Marvel only fighting game since Capcom's Marvel Super Heroes
Marvels Street Fighter
Storm's kit looks 👌🏽 I'm so happy for her 😭
Hopin' for Thor and Deadpool.
a marvel arc sys game was not on my 2025 bingo card
Give me Deadpool in this game and my life is yours
Happy birthday, merry Christmas what's next
marvel snap, marvel rivals ,and finally this. what is this company cooking with games like this! these are some solid studio choices they are making. the fighting game play is similar to DNF duel but with tag which i am going to enjoy alot since i was sad dnf duel player base is soo low dispite them having a sick roster abilities.
Yo the devs are actually cooking since this is the same dev team from dbz fighterz which us a peak game
"We put 'souls' at the end, so you know it's good."
marvel games been on fire recently
It's Guilty Gear with Marvel cast
its the studio that made guilty gear series, of course its gonna look great
Yes YYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSS🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I don’t play fighting games but this looks like it will operate differently, for some reason it gives me power stone 2 vibes - will definitely try out.
is this Arc System's take on Marvel Super Heroes?
Don't know why but the voices really remind me of the voices of the heroes and villains in My Hero Academia. The cadence and tone is very similar. I guess that's what Japanese super heroes sounds like.
Doom better have foot dive
I guess Wolverine will be dlc.
They did it, they finally did. A Ms. Marvel I don't immediately hate... *sigh... but whhhhhhhhy Robbie though, I want Johnny Blaze damnit.
Would be nice to see some alternate costumes, like from the what if series, that would be cool, and amazing. Big fan of marvel .
Wow.. Wow.. Wow... 👏👏👏
we so back
A 4 vs 4 Marvel Fighting game I really hope they gonna add the Fantastic 4
I sure hope that this arcsys game will actually have good singleplayer and be fun to play with friends too for the less fighting inclined players.
4V4也太狂野了点
😮😮🔥🔥🔥🔥
Did Dr doom say hinjaku? Hinjaku hinjaku hinjaku hinjaku! Not sure if I'll use Japanese or English voices for this
It looks great. Just feels kind of weird for me listening to japoneses voices for comics’ superheroes
We haven't had a solo Marvel Brawler game since Marvel Super Heroes.❓🤔👍💥😮
Seems like civil war
dragon ball fighterz with marvel characters
Am I the only one who think that this game is more like Dragon Ball FighterZ?
This was a HUGE one...Arc System Works whenever they touch became diamond!
I’m old now maaaan, idk if I can handle this kinda fastpaced 😭
i can already tell the japanese dub is going to be better than the english dub of this game
arc sys make a good mha game i beg all these 3d games are not it
Scorpion main when they see ghost rider: 😍
Welp, it's been fun Marvel vs Capcom Fighting Collection...
Holy peak
I hear nakamura yuichi perfectly
seems like guilty gear tbh
Can't wait for Marvel vs Marvel vs Capcom vs Capcom
I hope sonic fans don't see this after Sonic blitz (everyone was expecting a cool fighting game but SEGA gave us a stupid card mobile game...)
NO WAY! They made a marvel fighting game??????  Marvel games getting really good lately (definitely recovering from GOTG, that turn based game and Avengers games)
Esse eu vou jogar no Pc mesmo.
Literally can’t wait for this game
I like the look of it, though I'm not keen on Spidey's suit or Iron Man getting a Gundam head.  The rest look great!
hahahahah🤣
Arc System is cooking a new fighting game
Next Just give me this but only with Xmen and mutants
Omg marvel fighterz
MCOC rival
Marvel vs ...
Marvel got Japanized and I love it
It's marvel superheroes  2 or sequel
This is more exciting than the Switch 2 launch.
Did Dr Doom just use the glock he has stored in his pocket...?
Another. PLAYSTATION EXCLUSIVE?! WHY
I didn't know I needed a Gundam Iron Man in my life, until now.
EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT THE CHARACTERS BUT WHY NOT THE MUSIC
ITS MARHVEL BABY, NO WAIT...
Guilty Gear Marvel XXX
No way robbie reyes!!! Imma get it best ghost rider there is... Motorcycle horse and all is nice but nothing beats a muscle car 🤷🏽
Gasp... 🤓
Man this makes me miss so much the mvc franchise I don't know it is awesome but it feels some kind of emptiness not hearing any Capcom characters on the video  Rip mvc
looks really good
I know this is getting flak, but imma be the one to say it… Kamala is too light-skinned
Yo marvel games are cooking ❤
i need this marvel meets fighter z style amazing
ddue 4v4 is nutts hulk better get in
YESSSS I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THISSSS LET'S GOOOOO OMG
Graphics kinda android mobile
i am not marvel fan, but this looks awesome!
LETS GOOOOOOO A NEW MARVEL VIDEOGAME!??
No xbox 😢
Lemme find out Gambit is the game.
Patiently waiting for Magneto 🙏🏿
Soon as saw i ark system I knew it was gonna be good plus they got that good spidey sense
Let this be on all platforms
Like if you know it‘s Coby from One Piece 2:17
WoW! The art style is awesome!
Rip to MVC4
They're doing ANYTHING, but Rise of Hydra, dawg
It's hilarious to me to see a character named Captain America, dressed in Red, White, and Blue shouting in Japanese like Hanzo from Overwatch 🤣🤣
Whoa! 4v4. like KOF!
Doctor doom 😱😱😱😱
2XKO : "finally a worthy opponent"
Dr. Doom is just always up for aura-farming
I have begged for years for a Wanda and Vision in a game thats not like Midnight Suns or Rivals. I want Wanda and Vision and I want to quite literally destroy things as them. This is your chance. Wanda and Vision or I sadly wont be buying this. And to be fair Ive begged for years to have them both in a game where I can really just go at it. Please.
Let’s fking gooo
Friendship ends with Capcom.  Now  Arc it’s my best friend.  Este juego se ve que promete,ojalá no lo echen a perder❤
Why are they Japanese?
IT'S MAHVEL BAYBEE!
We boycotted MvC:I so hard, we killed the MvC franchise and made the next Marvel fighting game PS exclusive. 😅
"What are we, some kind of marvel rivals ?"
Marvel fighterz
Marvel street fighter got it.... 🗑
So… is this just a repeat of Marvel vs Capcom? I’ll be thoroughly surprised if capcom isn’t involved, or if this game doesn’t take heavy inspiration from Capcom.
This is my marvel superhero's 2
It’s time for Mahvel!!!
But why
Rip Marvel vs Capcom You were dead, now you are truly dead
why no xbox release, sony really be cry babys about games with spiderman in it
This is gonna be a banger fr
20 years of patience paid off. FINALLY! - Please, please, ⭐THE TAUNTS! We need them!! ⭐Awesome game!
Fighter Z but Marvels niceeee
Where can I get this music it's delicious
Thank you Arc System Works! Also thank you NetEase Games for saving Marvel games from garbage Western developers.
Bruuuuuuuuuh this looks siiiiiick
뒤지게 잘 뽑았네
I’m glad they added Kalama I like her as a character
Capcom is cooked
i might be crazy but i swear i heard 4 different jjba voices
SPIDER STRING
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
They announce and than cancels all projects 😂
Bro first Marvel Rivals now this Marvel fans are eating good
What a trailer, what a soundtrack
Why isn't Spiderman jumping around all ninbly mimbly
Doom pulling out the gun had me.
omg¡!!!!!!!
I wish it was Johnny Blaze
I'm not sure how to feel about this as a MvC fan....like for instance you're playing as Storm except she has an entirely new moveset from MvC series that you'll have to relearn. Same with all other characters.
Japanese spider man isn't the emissary from hell?
Miss Marvel? Again? What aren't they learning?
Was expecting Tekken gameplay for some reason
4v4, we should atleast got 40char on release  if not then oof
marvel fighters z
this looks amazing!!
this art style is beautiful. CLEAN!
Dude real who cares, Marvel is death!
Why why is it always anime style with marvel ??!!!
Thank god the east did this and not the west. Actually has style.
bro the fighterz team made marvel fighterz 😭 wheres my moro and granolah arc dlc
Excited but dfq u mean 4 characters ?
with doom and stuff
Arc System works try not to turn everything they touch to gold challenge (impossible)
Ironman has a V-fin.
Que les costaba hacer lo mismo pero con MVC :(((
imagine it releases when doomsday releases
This is like a Marvel of version of Injustice 2 or Dbfz
Why is iron a gundam? Don’t question just fw it
DR DOOM sounds like King Cold VA LOL
Would like to see black panther n bucky . Cos them boys have HANDS.
Que deliciosa la tormenta
Maybe we will have Marvel vs Marvel 1 before GTA VI.
This looks soooooo cool!!!
spideyyyy sense
Finally a civil war game
this looks so good hope it has a free version too or smthin
Woooooo hoooooo
why ms marvel ?
ill take one "marvel vs capcom"...hold the capcom
That 4 man team is the perfect number for a certain…. team of 4, hope we can introduce some sort of synergy move if we combine a certain group 💯
So who’s your favorite fighting game character? The fire guy from hell that uses chains and has a flaming skull Oh so Scorpion? …no
MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls looks fantastic, loving the Japanese take on the iconic characters, a real fresh look for them, Iron Man having elements of a mech is just perfection. 👌 Excited to see their take on other characters too!   Also the team at Arc System Works are so passionate about the Marvel universe, you can tell they are big fans. The game is going to be good. 😊
I'm not really into team based fighting games. I prefer the standard 1 v 1, but I'm gonna get this. 😅👍🏾
Why ironman has v-fin
About time
I've yet to meet a single person that likes Kamala Khan, why is she still being pushed/promoted?
they turned iron man into gundam exia
OH MY GOD STORM IS SO BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD ❤  jokes aside, they did her design so much justice in this game
Yup!!!
Nah, this looks fireeeee
Japan is full marvel weebs
deadpool, ghost rider, nightcrawler, blade. my team will be anightmare, please let this be possible.
I have no idea what their saying but I'm still gonna get it 👍
Marvel Minus Capcom
Really hoping it’s going to be available in Nintendo switch 2
I love how Japanese/anime every hero has been made to look   And doom is just doom because every the artist couldn't mess with doom
This is perfect!
Cannot wait to see more characters soon like thor hulk hawkeye black widow wolverine cyclops winter soldier black panther deadpool rocket racoon dr. Strange iron fist shuma garoth psylocke spider gwen etc.
This is literally a sequel to that marvel super heroes fighting game from the 90s but by a different studio and with more characters,awesome,that game was dope.  If theres no Supaidaman skin or character,im going to throw a massive fit,i demand to play as the emissary of hell himself.
Congrats Arc System Works for being a Sony Studio  A decades later  RIP Arc System Works for being a Sony Studio
What the absolute freaking heck❤
AYO WHAT?!
dragon ball figther z marvel
2:01 waifu Ms. Marvel.
Marvel VS Marvel
Supaidaman is back!
Snow White 2025 consequences bringed us this
🔥🔥🔥
Ms Marvel is SO cute
Finally, something cool!
Miss Marvel just being shot by japanizing beam, and she's cuteeeeee
I wish we could fight in the same team with a friend like 2XKO with 2vs2.
Ez Tōkon baszott. 😂
Marvel fighterz
This looks better than marvel vs capcom!
MS MARVEL IN A FIGHTING GAME LETS GOOOO !!!
Got flashbacks to Marvel Disc Wars and Future Avengers. This game is gonna be awesome!!
i don't want to die
New Guilty Gear game looking a bit different
Hopefully theres going to be english dubs
My only complaint here is that Ghost Rider needs to be more intimidating, dude needs a meal here, and bring back the leather jacket!
Xbox sisters... our response?
Iron Gundam
Xbox sisters... our response?
MHA x Marvel crossover please
This better have Japanese Spiderman, I mean come on 😂
F yeah! Marvel video game fighting is back! 🎉
Now we just need to have a Capcom vs. Capcom!... wait...
Doom has the Rugal vibes!
Noooo My goat Xbox 😭💀
bruh yelled "Spidey Sense!!!"
Marvel minus Capcom! 🔥
IspiderManuh
1:21 there's always doom💀
It's clear that keeping marvel titles out of American companies hands has been a massive win.
DBF style marvel game  Just shut up and take my money
still waiting for a marvel rpg GIVE US MARVEL HEROES BACK!
This looks genuinely fun. Yes im diehard vs capcom fan have no doubt in ArcSystems. They do amazing combat. Doom and Ms Marvel look great
NO NO NO They cant do this! They absolutely must not release a game with attractive characters! That's insensitive and illegal!
Sooooooo..... What does this mean for the future of marvel vs capcom??
Marvel VS Strive.
Star Lord’s VA sounds like Johnny?
4 vs 4 but are we getting the fantastic four? Thought.. I do wonder who’s the final boss, the Spot (the spiderverse one), Beyonder, the maker (the Richard from the ultimate universe) , the one below all? We already had thanos and galactus, ultron too as bosses in a marvel fighting games so I’m curious about whats this game main villan is. Because I wanna see a villan who was never used as a fighting game boss
Captain America is not jumping that high respectfully
Alright I'll ask the important questions: Marvel vs. Guilty Gear vs. Persona WHEN?
marvel has been going absolutely INSANE with their game development recently, shout out to all the amazing devs and their creative direction !!!!!!!!!
No big deal... just watched this trailer for like 10 times.
RIP Marvel VS Capcom 4
Man the japanese voice acting going crazy. Better have a japanese spider man outfit or im 😠
This feels like treason
スターロードの声優、山寺宏一やないか！！
Doom ultra instinct 1:24
2XKO Dead before arrival
Looks like db fighterz ❤
We got a Japanese dubbed marvel game before gta 6
Give us these guest characters  1. Ryu  2. Ken  3. Chun Li  4. Juri Han  5. Sakura  6. Dan  7. Vega  8. Sagat  9. Balrog  10. M.Bison  11. R.Mika
Please… i dont ask for much… please let Dr Doom say “FOOT DIVE”
1:07 ok I'm pre ordering idc
Mahvel Fighterz baby
Finally a new Marvel fighting game
I AM IRO... wait,  I AM GUNDAM!!
Another cool looking game which I will never play because I don’t wanna lose to a guy that will just juggle me for the entire game 😂 and yes I know I’m just bad
they pickup voice actor from MHA too, it's hype
Marvel vs Marvel
This is how we do it   awesome   Open love letter to marvel vs capcom series
Marvel characters with Japanese voices is something I never knew I needed
Arc systems got it. They've been knocking everything they touch out of the cabinet
Looks Promising, I hope so
I don't know why, but the Japanese voiclines sold it for me
DBFZ & GGST with Marvel characters
Injustice 2, Street fighter 5.. and a New fighting game will be added to my collection
LETS GOOO
ArcSys : instant buy
Y hulk???
Arc system work marvel game
marvel vs capcom wannabe
What about android
Marvel vs Capcom, hold the Capcom.
Please dont release an english dub
I don’t like side fighting games but this one looks good.
I'm not interested. The EVO elitist will see it as a worthy MARVEL game, but it won't be the same as what CRAPCOM ABANDON.  And it's worse when they first showed MsMarver and without *WOLVERINE AND PSYLOCKE, THEIR GAME IS NOTHING* .  Until then, I'll show indifference to an ArcSys game that's just another Guilty Gear.
Marvel is doing something great for the gaming market, and I'm here for it. The art syle is so dope!
Now this looks Dope!❤
please just give me the fantastic four for the first time in this game🙏🏻
DC is FINISHED 😭😭✌🏽
2XKO has some competition now lol.
bro is dragon ball fighter z but the marvel version
Mmm
wow, cap lookin good in BLUE, and the RED, i wonder when we'll ever get a HOLLOW PURPLE captain america color palette🙂
Yes yes and more yes
Marvel feel Guilty Gear
OK, now I definitely have a reason to get a PS5. This looks insane!
Guilty gear but Marvel, right?
We got ghostrider axl low befpre gta 6
thank you dbfz for making this happen
Mortal Kombat [ Marvel Edition ]
Just ps5 and pc... What a deception
Japanese Marvel is kinda awesome.
🤣
foda
Please tell me it will atleast be in pc
Splendid
is a fighter z
Marvel kombat
finally! a sequal! Marvel Super Heroes 2!
Please tell me blade and Emma frost gonna be apart of this
That would be marvel vs capcom 3
Peak!!!
I hope it will be on steam
4v4s? MATCHES WILL NEVER END
Bring my boy CYCLOPS!!!
Man these Asian companies doing these marvel games insan justice way better then any western company could do 😂
Yeah x men 🎉
Captain America Civil War
I love Dragon Ball FighterZ from Arc System Works. I was having a dream two months ago about What if ? Arc system works make a DC or a Marvel Fighting game like FighterZ. So, a dream came true. I am so happy
this artstyle is incredible, might have to cop this lowkey...
Great! My dream is becoming true now, can't believe this....
Playstation is Death 😢
FOOT DIVE
Japanese Spider-Man, I approve
God I just want an rpg marvel game. Bring back marvel heroes omega or something
20 charaters at launch typical
This game will be a Marvel   Say that again?
Marvel gaming fans are EATING
its like marvel super heroes but modern
YES F***ING YES FINALLY! ive been waiting for so long for a marvel only fighting game! at first i was hoping on NRS to do it but after mk1 i dont trust em anymore. this is way better than i could've ever imagined, only problem is that its so far away
Dragon ball FighterZ 2 looks strange
ITS MAVHEL BAYBEE!!!
When I was a child, we'd get at least two franchises in a game like this
Please add finishers or like fatalities
This is literally a dream come true!!!!! This is amazing ❤
Will this be available on Xbox?
Gran blue, guilty strive I know arc won't disappoint marvel that's for sure
No English Dubs ? i love Japanese dub in anime but for Marvel characters its weird lol
"No All Marvel Characters English Voice Acting In This Game, Japanese Voice Acting Only"
I guess Capcom let out a big sigh this time...
needs more divas
Dr doom is a selling point I’m buying
Oh yeah, MARVEL FIGHTERZ
Where's Capcom at tho? It looks dope as hell, but uhhhh....👀 where's Capcom @ lol?
Marvel has finally started a revival I love you marvel ❤
It's available on pc
4v4 that's too much
Does Capcom get royalties for this?
we need never been released characters in a fighting game like Jubilee, Dazzler, Nightcrawler, Emma Frost and Loki
1:55 FOOTDIVE MENTIONED
SPIDEEYY SENSE!
Man i will play this  game just for the voice acting
👍
WHERES WOLVERINE & VENOM!
Another Marvel game.. 🤦🏻‍♀️
TEKKEN
the biggest L for project L
capcom relashionship ended now arc system is my new friend
I CAN'T STOP SCREAMING!! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHTAAAAAAFAAAACK!
Coming to Switch 2? 🤞🏾
me : was hoping for a "Fate" arcsys fighting game got a Marvel fighting game instead. sadness x1000
Marvel + Street Fighter + Tekken?
What is this anime trash? That's a L.
Well, good to see Starlord replaced Cable in terms of laser cheese
MS. MARVEL!!!!
Mahvel is back baby
Let's go!
We got Marvel FighterZ before GTA VI
it takes a asian team arc system to make good marvel fighting game while marvel vs capcom 3 is just bad on plots, unbalance and high GB size
Spidermada
Marvel Academia
Iron mans design is marvellous ❤
Please please I want it to arrive for Nintendo Switch 2, I want to have it in my hands, I need it.
Please have cross play, please have cross play
Boku no Hero Academia Vibes.
This is so freaking hype dude
Marvel Super Heroes 2 looks amazing
Looks amazing. Really hope the roster is huge and  really hoping to see Punisher and Daredevil.
SPIDEY SENSEEE
I am not battle type gamer but I definitely will buy this one. Very good design!!!!
Awesome, but why don't they make games for android too ??
My wishlist for this game: Peni Parker Deathpool Iron Heart  Black Panther  Iron Fist  Daredevil  War Machine Luna Snow  Aero Spider Man(Miles Morales) Loki Big Hero 6 Captain Marvel  Rescue She-Hulk Io and Crescent  Hope you guys will hear our voices,Marvel❤❤❤❤❤...
Marvel fighter z lets gooooooooooo
Rest in peace... *DRAGON* *BALL* *FIGHTERZ* 😭❤
We want this in ps4
Is that Miyuki Sawashiro voicing Storm??? The casting is spot on!
I don't know if anyone notice this but did Star Lord just do Dante special moves in Marvel vs Capcom?😅...the gun move  here 0:59
THANK YOU JAPAN
@cyanic3148 Doesn't make sense though, It's not a move per se. It's a feeling that something bad will happen, amplified.  Unless they turn it into a cancel dodge where whatever he's doing, he can cancel it mid-action and dodge instantly
Cool... so another 3 button mashing fighter like dbfz😂😂😂
GIVE ME THIS GAME AND MY SOUL IS URS
-Injustice- Marvel Fighters
Storm looks badass. Go marvel.
2XKO Dead on Arrival
DRAGONBALL FIGHTERZ 2!!!!!!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉😢😂😢😂😮😂😮🎉🎉😮😂😮🎉😮🎉😮😅😂😅🎉😅🎉😅😂😅😅
Marvel really said: “No. More. Mid-ahh games” 🔥
Am i the only one who feel it look like DBZF
I’ll stick to marvel rivals
I think this game will be Fantastic 4 a reason...
4v4 is crazy work. Gotta actually learn half the roaster on release
Not only did Arcsys kill Marvel Infinite, they literally just stole it's gameplay. Absolute kino. Give me Venom and Carnage!
The cast so far.  Captain America Iron Man Spider Man Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan) Starlord Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes) Doctor Doom Storm  So basically, most characters that have appeared in Marvel vs Capcom, except for Starlord and Ms. Marvel, who both debut in this game. I am excited to see who they add in next. I do hope they add some weird characters like MODOK or obscure characters like Warlock.
We got Gundam Iron Man before GTA 6
Marvel street fighting rivals
Marvel are cooking this year marvel rivals know this
Marvel Tokon, more like Marvel Tekken
BRUTAL ❤
Hulkasmash......
Robbie Reyes ghostrider hell yeah❤❤
This is amazing like a DBZF2
The Gundam-esque Iron Man looks really cool!
Gonna take you for a ride.
I still can’t believe this is real  ASW x Marvel? Inject it directly in to my veins  MAHVEL IS BACK
I strongly dislike the ms marvel character choice because it’s a terrible character but everything else is good.
So Japan saw the Chinese coming up with a commercially succesful Marvel game and said "Bet"
Isn't it a bit sad that it took the Japanese and the Chinese to do Marvel right?
Doctor Doom with an Akuma voice…who would’ve thought 🔥🔥🔥
Who ever is in charge of marvel games I love them so much
Doom 🔥🔥😮‍💨
Looking great  hope there's a bit more chars in there, def hit it outta the park with this one.
This is Marvelous! Can't wait to see more of the roster (would love to see Black Cat personally with a Felicia like moveset from Darkstalkers) The attack animations, the effects, the visuals. It's an amazing start, super hyped for this!
Asian devs again showing Marvel how it's done
GG to all other fighting games.
Hell yeah 😮😁😏😎👌🏾 I’m Sold take my money MARVEL
I hope theres more characters, this looks peak.
Cuando saldrá para la Nintendo Switch 2?, porque ahí si venderá. 🤣
One minor quibble: Spiderman needs his mech, like any good emissary of Hell. 😅
Western devs failed Marvel, let eastern dev take the mantle
First Marvel Rivals, now Marvel Tokon.  Who would have thought that not trying to "modernize" source material is exactly what source material fans want, DC?  Eastern Power! 🐲
ngl this is so FIREEEE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dragon Marvel Vs Capcom Fighter Cinematic Universe Z
Marvel's Street Fighter Tag Tourmament.
Avengers assembleuuuuu
shut up and take my money!!!
Ms marvel so cute in this game 😂
Supaida-man
Is that Miyuki Sawashiro as Storm? She kept getting cast as electric women in games lol
No Xbox??? Wth!
GHOST RIDERRR!!!
that mean nodeal capcom
That drawing looks amazing.
Ok yall need to chill!!! Ain’t nobody tell ya go this hard now yall can take my money and leave me alone 😂😂😂
W announcement
Dragon ball fighter Z with the Marvel characters ahahaha
*BROTHERS... DO YOU GUYS HONESTLY THINK THIS IS "PEAK"?*
1:39 Is that a JOJO reference!!!???
So, if you get a team wipe, would the new term be Happy New Year
Ngl, Arc really be making their own games irrelevant. How you gonna drop this right when HxH is dropping soon lol.
smart choice to finally lend your ip's to someone who's skilled, thanks.
this looks like so much fun I can't wait to get my hands on it
Redemption for Rivals Season 2 being trash
Best ever arigato gozaimashita
why does marvel keep trying to push star lord so much?  get the punisher or some other actual good character in there lol
We're So back baby!!
Theyre cookin 🔥🔥🔥
I hope the thing in the trailer wasn't strive wall brake, im tierd of breaking walls, bad mechanic for people who don't want to learn how to play defense.
What?
Now I want a ps5
Man us westerns getting our asses handed to us in games production lately, but I ain't complaining!
>No Xbox  >No Switch 2 As a PS5 owner I can’t support this anti consumer practices.
Is wrong of me to expect an insanely large roster and synergies between characters?
0:57 ye le ??
great roster AND cool character designs. i'm interested.
Marvel saw that injustice 3 was rumored and decided to pull this out of their sleeves. 2026 is about to be a crazy year for games.
WHERE… WHERE IS HE… WHERE IS INSOMNIAC WOLVERINE!?!
Marvel VS DC using this style would be awsome..or Marvel VS Street Fighter..or Marvel VS KingofFigter..
ARCSYS MARVEL VS GAME?! Didn't expect this at all!!!!
I wonder if we will see again the FOOT DIVE!!!
i wish they put quicksilver there
Shut up and take my money!!
More of the same... that format 1x1 2D like street fighter is boring already
The fighting game tournament scene is gonna LOVE this game. I could already tell
Marvel taking over gaming, DC gotta step up
Marvel sparking zero?
4v4 huh? The roster better be huge
You had so much time to do something capcom.
Ooooommmmmggggg
Thats to fast for me.. like what is happening
Close enough... Welcome Back Marvel Versus... Marvel
1:53 how it feels to read mainline 616 peter parker in 2025
This will be my next fighting for next year
So this is why we don't have a Dragonball Fighter Z sequel. Arc been in the lab cooking with this Marvel game. I still haven't given up hope for DBFZ 2 though. I love DBFZ so much.
Thought we get Marvel Injustice treatment from Netherealm. But this is okay too
We better get a 70s Supaida-Man Skin eventually for this!!!
Pony Station 5 exclusive? Why no Xbox?
I hope this game release in PS4 Too
Where is His FOOT DIVE
Fantastic 4 bout to be lit if they add them
😵🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Let's hope that Dr. Doom's Foot Dive mode is in.
Doom have a Gun  💀
I was surprised when I suddenly heard the exact same Japanese voice actor from the MCU dubs. It was the voice of Captain America, just as I remember it. Star-Lord also had the exact same Japanese voice actor, and I deeply appreciate the respect shown to them. I’ve never bought a Marvel game before, but this really makes me want to experience it. Thank you.
Let arc cook
JAPANIZING BEAM at its finest!
Japan saw China make rivals and they were like "aight bet".
Looks lit
Dragon ball z fighter
Marvel Rivals type feel.......
1:07 gotta love the ghost rider🔥💀
Ms Marvel still using her original inhuman powers!
Storm ult made it over here too nooooo
Crazy 😮😮😮😮
Best fighting game coming
Finally, Marvel "Disk Wars" fighting game.
HYPEEEE
GHOST RIDER HE HASNT BEEN FORGOTTEN BY THE WRITERS ♥♥♥🔥🔥🔥
Everything LOOKS great so far!⭐💣🔥💯📠
so 4XKO but marvel
ITS MARVEL BAAAAAAAYYYYYYBBEEEEEEEEE
SUPAIDAMAN!
I love you Playstation!
Se imaginan que lo saquen en español?
Doom already farming aura with that slow walk
Japanese Spider-Man better be dlc.
This looks so incredibly sick and I don't even play fighting games... but you better believe I'll be there day one
🤔Will it support NVIDIA DLSS 4 and Reflex 2 on PC?
Where is the Grapper?
Is this a dream?
カプコンと決別したのか…
Finally, a Marvel fighting game that is JUST Marvel.  We haven't gotten one in years. This'll be peak.
Feels like dbz fighters 🔥🔥💯💯
So.... 2XKO took soooooo F#%$ing long to release their game... that marvel just made their own version of it....   lol
Looks amazing! But...just 8 chacters??
This is exactly what we needed, hell yea!
I hope this will be so popular as rivals now.  Because at last — roster with only marvel characters.
IT’S MAHVEL BABY!!
Death of 2xko
This is gonna be incredible.
WOW!!!😊 Se vé poca madre!
Looks like a lot fun!
Btuh just make it 1v1
Need a 5v5 Marvel's MOBA Game. ✋😭
2026?  Get out of here.
This looks like the developers of marvel rivals touched this and I’m all here for it.
Lookssss sooo goooooddd. Pleas do the ultimate well
This better be for free
bro this will be so sick for 3 days
Arc systems is making a marvel fighting game?!
Please, give me Cyclops in this game👏🏼
love the art style
Goku has been imprisoned for eternity to allow these games's existence, lets all oray for Goku's nobel sacrifice
Guilty Gear + dbfz = This Game
Finally!!!!! Marvel fighting game return
Okay no one's gonna mention that Ironman Gundam/Kamen Rider inspired design?
Looks cool, I'm just sad now that we won't be getting MVC
Okay, but Akityama as Star-lord wasn't on my 2025 list
When you realize we all funded this game 😂
Why is this so anime?! And why do I love it so much?!
My first fighting game was marvel vs capcom 3 on the ps3 and now this!? So hyped for this game, can’t wait to play it with my dad
The asian devs always cook
i thought it was Marvel Vs Capcom but ay this will suffice
Definitely some dragon ball fighterz elements going on here
In the immortal words of The “kool-aid” Man  “Oh yeah”!!!!👍
Sold!!!
Ok we need a Marvel Anime series in proper Japanese now 10 seasons
🤯💜
Hope they add king to this game for dlc🎉🎆🎇
Ironman become gundam
It's been a while since I've seen a Ghost Rider in a Marvel game.
You can finally play the best spiderman aka EMISSARY FROM HELL SUPIDAMAN
This is what "Fatal Fury: City of the wolves" should have been like [ 餓狼伝説:狼の街 ]
It seems Marvel doesn't understand, we want a Marvel VS Capcom that includes the X-MEN
FOOT DIVE FOOT DIVE FOOT DIVE
will it be in English 😢
No gooner skins? I still with Marvel Rivals.
how many gallons can i lose
❤❤❤
Game needs a title change but overall looks really good
I never realized how well ms marvel’s design would fit in an anime art style
Coming from ArcSys it's safe to say this will be great! Dragon Ball FighterZ and Guilty Gear series are proof enough.
I propose the 4-person merry Christmas be called a happy new year.
Pass
My neurons were firing all at once trying to keep up with this.
No make something else we don't wont this
U know it’s gonna be a good fighting game when it’s made by arc system works 🔥
Now I gotta get a PS5! Just for this, so awesome!!!
MARVEL - Strive - W Arc sys
Mar-Verous!!!🗣️
I love how Iron Man looks like a Gundam lol
*Blade.*  Put him _in._
Kamala khan is so cute😂
Foot dive
Japanese…oh…😮😮😮😮😊😊😊😊
Looks pretty great! :)
I think they used same mechanism as DRAGON BALL FIGHTERZ
Therapist: Anime Storm isn't real -- she can't marry you. Me: 😞
I love how the Asian game devs keep making storm a baddie.
Did you notice that Iron Man had a Gundam V antenna on his forehead?
Why does it look like captain America has a durag?!? That’s awesome 😂
Arc system works? Holy we might have a good fighter
From guilty gears dev? Im in
Just like DRAGON BALL FIGHTERZ
2XKO IN SHAMBLES RN
Can't wait to play Emma Frost in this game too 🙌
Can't wait to call this Marvel TFS lol
Nice, good graphics too.
Once again, Spiderman did another useless backflip. Never change marvel. 1:09
Marvel Tokōn ❌  Marvel Tekken ✅
How Marvel VS Capcom would looks like... Without the Capcom cast?! O_o
And just like that… Marvel just upstaged SGF! 😂
Wait!! What about the Capcom Characters though? Megaman? Morrigan? Zero? Resident evil? Arthur? Okami? And especially Mayor Haggar!?!??!?!??!?!?!,
DC could never
Close enough… welcome back FighterZ
Well it’s something fresh marvel vs capcom is getting old this looks promising
Seriously, PS5 exclusive again?
Japanese spiderman fit for the Spiderman. Good lord Suupaayydommaan
KAMEN RIDER IRON MAN?
MARVEL BABY!
This was like a fever dream 😂😂😂
ima be deadass non american marvel content is pretty baller and much better designs
Future doom main here 🙌
My marvel academy
Vish this is one copy Dragon Ball  Fighter Z
Better get IRON FIST on the roster
Mainstream is gonna find out why Arc System is the kings of 2D fighters.
Where cyclops
oh another brawlhala we are cooked
Bro marvels been cooking lately
My goat Robby Reyes!!!
si no esta mi lokito de la luna no se cual sera mi main
Lol 8 characthers
This looks incredible
They didn’t have to add the Aisan theme in though
ゴーストライターはロビーよりジョニー派
Marvel finally realizing only the Japanese can do American comics any justice.
First time japanese launguage 😮😮😮
Nice to see Robbie Reyes get some love
Buying this day 1
I'm willing to commit a blood sacrifice for Capcom Team and Arcsys Team dlcs
So making them talk in japanese increase the sales?
“OHHH A NEW MARVEL GAME”  *sees its from Japan*  “Sighhhh”
Nooo why the GG strive corner mechanics 😭
Marvel fighterz
Close enough welcome back marvel vs capcom
That Ironman skin better come to Rivals
Gonna say, I would love if Spider-man would pull up oil tanker like DIO from JoJo OVA, as it would be also reference  to Ultimate Spider-man final fight with Osborn. I know it will be not that, but dammit, I want to share that idea.
Thank you!!! ❤❤❤
This game is going to sell like crazy
Lets goooooooo
happy pride month I guess
Is coming to gamepass?
Man I hope we get Sentry, Blue Marvel, Hyperion and Gladiator…
you cant tell me that iron man is not a kamen rider. look at the helmet. classic showa rider.
i just need to see arcsys logo to know that the game will be absolute fire too bad i suck at fighting games
Zero efforts in naming. It sounds very similar to Tekken. 🤣🤣
CLOSE ENOUGH WELCOME BACK MARVEL VS CAPCOM
4v4?  Gotta say, it feels fantastic.
Injustice 3 found dead inside a dumpster in Florida
Please make it 2v2 locally (4 controllers)
Holy moly this is all i've wanted for so long! Now we just need an awesome roster of characters and we're golden!  I'm so hype!!
nakamura as captain🔥🔥🔥🔥
Basically Marvel Superheroes 2!
Is this comic look just an option or is it the only option?
Finally video games are back!
Okay
I am so glad that Marvel games have moved past the let's make everything look like the MCU phase.
So sad not on xbox
So marvel copying league of legends  2XKO?
MUMEN RIDER AS CAPTAIN AMERICA LETS GOOOOOO 🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I wish Microsoft would buy Sony.
Starlord sounded like DIO 😂
Arksys, please do One Piece next after this gem! Speaking of gems... hopefully, Thanos is in here.
Nobody's gonna talk about Tony's armor having a V fin in like some short of gundam?
GHOST RIDERRRR!!!
Hope Gambit, T'challa, Green Goblin, Bucky, Wolverine, and the Fantastic 4 are in here!
street fighter marvel, nice, good job marvel u know what the fans like
bruh  this studio are cooking
urghhh another marvel themed game
Oh yes!
Marvel rivals street fighter
These Marvel Games are saving Marve franchise from dying and Marvel Rivals proved that.
The rendering is absolutely amazing, what a fantastic job!
스파이더맨 아이언맨 캡틴아메리카 닥터둠 스톰 고스트라이더 스타로드 미즈마블
bro, Spiderman yelling out his Spidey Sense like a signature move, if this takes off this is gonna go crazy on EVO
Main Kamala Khan.
LIFE IS GOOD!
Give me Mister Fantastic please
I have a sneaking suspicion that this will be free to play
I'll take Squirrel Girl, Penny Parker and Luna Snow over Kamala any day, she just feels like a bootleg version of Reed Richards.
They jumped my boy spidey 💀💀💀
Incredible it has the same feel and look to FighterZ
IRON GUNDAM!
I thought most of these characters were American why are they speaking Japanese?
It looks amazing
You guys think they'll have guest characters from other fighting games?
So we just gonna ignore how Star Lord fights exactly like Dante from Marvel vs Capcom 3?
Very dragon ball fighterz, means this game gonna be peak
Anyine else notice there are a LOT of moves/similar animations that made it over from MVC? Like very similar attacks, looking at Spiderman and Ghostrider specifically
this looks so beautiful man😭
Why'd they give tony a gundam v fin 😭
Yeah I'll just stick to rivals
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
These designs are 🔥🔥!!!
Marvel FighterZ with Ghost Rider in the base roster?!  HELL YES!!🔥
They actually spelled tekken wrong
Finally a super hero version of fighterZ 🔥
Psylocke will return🙏
Arc System Works ? nice...
👍😼 very interesting
Storm takes my breath away (by summoning a F5  tornado)
It’s time for MAAAAAHVEL
I am so glad Vergil isnt in my Marvel fighting game
Ngl, this is the most disgusting backstab against capcom in my entire life
dammm thats some character design love it ❤
Waiting for the Wazzler to start triggering refunds
Love how fighter z was crossplay but then this is only for ps and steam 🙃 robbed xbox players fr
holy i love this art style sadly i don’t like mortal combat like games but i’ll definitely be giving this a chance
This game reminds me of Dragon Ball Fighters
RIP 2XKO
Marvel guitly gear  Marvel guilty gear
This looks like it's gonna be a DLC fiesta. Hope I'm wrong...
Let's go ahead and change the name tho, that's a terrible name
ok game play full screen and mid screen poke to convert full combo just like marvel vs capcom hell yeah
Marvel Rivals Marvel Cosmic Invasion Now this.  True Believers are eating good this and next year.
Tbh WB did this years ago it's the same thing just with Marvel 😂
This looks incredible! And I must say, hearing all these characters speak Japanese is so satisfying
It's 2025 and now we have Tony Gundam.
I need that Cap skin in Rivals.
Monarch Pistol Fortnite
MAHVEL IS BACK BABY
I Need all these outfits in Marvel Rivals
Can't wait to hear "COUNTER" when the round starts in this game too
Broo the combination of anime and marvel i love it 😍
Close enough, welcome Dragon Ball FighterZ 2. 😂😂
Okay but I may actually buy this amazing game because it looks really fun af.  Also, hoping that there's an English Voiceline because I just feel like it fits with an English Voice. Tbf, I also like using JP Voiceline but I just like ENG Voicelines even more
KAMALA KHAAAAAANNNN
The last time there was a Marvel only fighting game was Marvel Super Heroes
tag fighter bye :(
ill be damned...its mahvel...vs mahvel baby!
My god, they made Kamala tolerable enough to acknowledge her existence!  Well done Arksys!
Hmm as a marvel vs Capcom fan idk how I feel. lots of moves looked copied and pasted over with new characters. Ms. Marvel moves like super skrull, ghost Rider like dante, Spider-Man like x-23,...Not to say I won't buy it😅
Marvel Super Heroes 2
Hope there's a English dub
gojo=captain america😂😂
Dante Reference with the ultimate of Starlord?
next anime series
Star Lord is voiced by Joseph Joestar i think  Also Daredevil, F4, and Thor confirmed due the statue, Baxter Building, Nelson and Murdock, and Fogwells gym being in the stage.
What did bro just say?! 🤣 0:47
It was all fine and dandy until Kamala Khan showed up
0:52 You have alerted the horde!
Where's his FOOT DIVE!!!!
I must be blind because I didn't see the Arc system works in the beginning and just noticed 5 hours later. No wonder why the style looks so familiar, I didn't play mvc so I assumed it was from that but from the people who made dbzf and GUILTY GEAR. Ofc, bravo
This is just copying injustice😂😂😂
What is this, some kinda Marvel Rivals? In all seriousness this looks really fun, as other people have said, a Marvel only fighting game (MvC will always be peak tho), they seem to have a really nice artstyle, fun gameplay, the voice acting is great (also on a side note I love how they gave Star Lord a deeper voice, I feel like it fits his earlier comic appearances- he’s changed a lot throughout the years). All in all, very excited. Yet another Marvel game, the hype continues to grow. Make mine Marvel!
Someone in Marvel team been playing the Marvel vs. Capcom lately😂
And why are they speaking japanese... where's the english version
0:48 Spidey Sense!!! 😂
This game would have been much better with its American designs and English voices.... I love Japan but these characters have a strong occidental identity in fact CAPCOM understood that
Heeeeey this is a nice surprise
marvel cooking in games 🎯
what does this mean are they dropping Capcom
차라리 고퀄리티 2D 로 나오지 ㅠㅠ
Is Marvel coming back with their gamee titles?
It's not Tekken.. It's Tōkon
We need an edit playing Smell of the Game from Guilty Gears
So Marvel Superheroes Remake.
manteb iki lur
...welp, can't play it. My hype fades like the morning dew...
Se ve increible, pero las skins estan feisimas
Marvel VS Capcom is dead forever  Capcom characters was a waste of time  leaching off the Marvel characters  Drop that fake Mr. Fantastic her movie bomb, she going to ruing the game (unpick character)
Is Goku holding this game's code together too?
Ngl.. fills like watching my hero academia and I kinda like it 😂
What a sick looking game! Take my money 💸💸💸 💰💰💰
So excited!! (I don't even own a PS)
Killmonger: Hey that's a...  Tony: Yeah, a Gundam suit
This game is same as dragon ball fighter z but you will enjoy dngz more than this games I can guarantee that
They are still pushing Ms Marvel again.  ..
0:45 new suit for psm to talk about
It’s the same studio that made dbz fighterz  It’s gonna be good
I was sold at "Arc System Works" lets goooooo! This looks freakin awesome!
Wanda in this game please
WOW!
Daredevil, shang chi, luke cage, spiderman, black widow, are perfect for this type of game. Iron man and storm for me not so much
Spiderman dropkicks Doom  Convenient? I think not!
capcom .... is crying right now
JAPANESE SPIDER-MAAAN LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Gundamman is cool
2:10 Staandoo
This looks more complete than 2XKO
AI could never ...
So no Xbox bruh
Marvel anime fighting game oh hell yeah
The visuals might be the best I’ve seen in a fighting game
> Game does not launch on Xbox  This...this does put a smile on my face
Thank goodness. THANK YOU. I hope it will have a larger roster than that tho.
Marvel be cooking with these🔥🔥
A Marvel anime fighter... hell yeah
Why are they fighting among themselves? Are they some kind of rivals?
Gonna have both Riot and NetEase sweatin' with this one.
Marvel's FIghterZ
Now add Capcom characters.
Why 4v4 tho
Please let there be English dub
0:46 spidamaa
Sssuuuuuuggggggoooooiiiiiiii
Will this be available in English?
My wallet is tired. Im already buying Marvel Rivals skins now im gonna be playing this too.
Ok..I'm intrigued..
This is nearly cooler than the Marvel vs. Capcom games!! But MvC will always be the goat!!!
THIS IS WILD!
I guess we can say, Marvel has some RIVALS
This game looks fantastic
It NEEDS a dub though.
The second I saw Iron Man my first thought was "I thought this was a Marvel fighting game, not Armored Core". Not that his design doesn't look cool, it just threw me off for him to have a more Japanese Mech design.
Pleeeease let this game be 4 players vs. 4 players, Guilty Gear's team mode died so fast, I want a fighting game where people actually do team fights and take them seriously.
IT'S MAHVEL BABY!!!!
Is this another new mode in Marvel Rivals?? 😟
1:21〜悪◯博士⁉️ブリキだぞオメェ！  フォトンショットやモレキュラーシールド🪨🪨期待！で 申し訳ございません♪
That dr doom looks and sounds so good.
Yasss for STORM!!!
So dragon ball fighterz, but marvel????? I’m in
Ok, I guess I can buy this game.
Nice!
! I like how this game is like Marvel vs Capcom but with more cinematic super moves!
I mean, I thought this is a marvel version of "injustice 2", this game is awesome but I'm marvel fans. We finally got a game like that but not the same style, I prefer the style of injustice 2
Thank you for doing Kamala Khan justice, unlike the MCU one.
Bro give us a huge roster, a nice story, and costumes for each character and you have me 😍
No one piece what the flark
CONGATS MARVEL!!! You are about to have two banger games coming out and I'm going to play this like crazy, I could tell that I was 10 seconds in
Good bye 2XKO
Somewhere a Capcom exec is chewing out his subordinates.
Looks nice but it’s missing one thing…VENOM! Venom has to be included in this!
Marvel minus Capcom
terrible borra
So neat how Asians understand what Marvel fans want when the cargo culture who are in charge in America have no clue.
Why do they want to make Asian Marvels?
I WAITING  FOR IT
RIP MvC lol
I need to see Norman Osborn
autobuy
I don't speak taka taka 😢
My buddy is pretty excited for this and talks about it being a big deal, but I don't really understand why. I'm not much of a fighting game guy, but I have played some in the past.   To me this just looks like MvC3 with no Capcom, a different artstyle, stage changes, and another character on the team. Which doesn't really feal all that impressive a change to me.  Am I like missing something? Or is this just something that I'd have to be a fighting game fan to understand?
Hope the "Scarlet Witch" finally get put into a fighting game.
This graphics but as an arena fighter. Would be cool.
YES. TAKE MY MONEY. 🤩🤩🤩
ITS MAHVAL!!
Literally dragon ball fighterz with Marvel skins
Is this mvc3 but just Mv without the 3
Why did they need Star Lord, Ms. Marvel, Dr. Doom, and Captain America to beat down spider man 😭
look cool not gonna lie japanese marvel game
I don't even play fighting games but I want this so bad
Barrigan is DOOM?!
Its MARVEL minus CAPCOM :)
Too bad MK1 didn't adopt the 4 v 4 tag team. It could've been as great as this game looks
Marvel street fighter
spiderman yelling SUPAIDIII SENSU!!! is this the supaidaman version??? if so let that leopardon zord loose!!
0:57 i swear thats the same move dante does in mvc3
Why can’t they make a dark and gore game for once 😭😭😭
This is gonna sell forsure😆🔥 ‼️ remind me of Dragon Ball FighterZ
Supaidaman
Now Iron Man has Dragon install
It looks kinda mid tbh 😅
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
0:59 so yall really just gonna copy and paste Dante’s special from MVC3 😂😂😂
Now every character is gonna cost you 15$ each and each alt color and extra 10$, oh yea secret boss fight? 25$ please
EXCEPTIONAL art direction
Not at all interesting
NIGHTCRAWLER PLEASE!!
Marvel FighterZ
spidaman！
Spidey can't catch a break bro ;-;  Finally, ghost rider
Dr Doom giving Rugal Bernstein vibes 🥰
I've been praying for a Marvel Arksys game since Strive was released and Capcom fumbled MvC Infinite.
i love the jp voices❤❤
So it’s marvel vs capcom mix with injustice
You hired the absolute perfect studio for this title. Great job, Marvel!  This an absolute W!
And
"DC has better games" Not these days anyways
I will Buy A PS% if I have to. I was they on Dreamcast day 1 of MVC2 and I will be for this as well.
Ms. Marvel think she part of the team. 😂
Friendly fire might be on this game
Why do they keep trying to make Ms. Marvel happen? I can think of 100 other female Marvel characters that would have been better choices.
auto beli mantap
I’m so f’n on
so basically its just marvel vs. 2 just reskinned on a new system. what garbage😂
I'm so hyped
Multiversus died so Marvel Tokon soar through the skies.
on my knees begging for playable Carnage in either this or Rivals
⚡1:35, MOTHA! They Want This Game To Sell Like Hotcakes! I'm Buying It!⚡
FINALLY robby reyes got some love from marvel game
LETS GOOO!!!!
I need that roster dropped this instant!
probably only going to be a roster of 12 lol, hoping iron fist is included. He should Definitely be in marvel fighter games more.
This is not mvc
No Xbox!!!!?? Come man! 😢
why is the game basically called "Marvel fighting spirit (soul): Fighting Souls" 💀
Storm with tha THICCumz 🤦‍♂️🤝👏
I don’t really like tag fighters, but it’s an arc sys game. I guess I’ll at least give this a try.
Oh this is so hype I’m ready for this I’m putting in hours to learn this!!
💙1:35, THE BEST PART OF THE TRAILER!💙
😂oh yess this is good
wait i did not expect they speak japanese hahaha
I feel like Arc System Works is giving us the Marvel Vs. Capcom 4 we were always owed as a fandom... minus the Capcom.
Marvel getting all these cool games meanwhile DC hasnt had a good game since arkham knight
Iron man is like a gundam, and i like it!!!!
This could be what Marvel Vs Capcom Infinite failed to be…
Since The Fortnite season  Marvel has been releasing absolute bangers 🔥🔥🔥
mvc5... minus the c
Bring me the next guardians of the galaxy game!!!
Capcom:😥
captain Japanese confirmed???????
I hope you don't forget Psylocke, Moon Knight, Venom and Gambit
That. Looks. AMAZING!!!!! 😭
Copy Paste of Dragon Ball Fighter Z ☹️
A marvel game not in English is, different 😮
"I was conflicted...."
Holy peak 🎉
声優がむっちゃ豪華
Playstation is cooking for next year: Ghost Yotei, Marvel Token GTA 6
Spidey looks fresh i hope theres a black suit skin
Finally, gundam iron man
This should be a $ printer
If that Spidey is not the "EMMISARY OF HELL, SUPAIDAMAN" variant, it will be a missed opportunity XD
Marvel vs Guilty Gear
I just had to watch..To Everyone involved this game is beautiful. 😊... True Believers.. Excelsior 🙏
the voice acting is 🔥
This looks sweet 😋😋
If all 4 characters get hit as part of a combo is that a happy new year?
Eh close enough, Welcome back Marvel Super Heroes 4!
So freaking good 🎉🎉🎉
2:06 redline reference
I don’t know who’s leading the Marvel Video Game side.  BUT THEY HAVE BEEN COOKING!!!
Ironman with V-fin!
This is peak
Meeeeehhh
EVERYTHING looks so cool 😭😭
Big hands!! Run!!!
2XKO getting mogged
Arc System Works está desenvolvendo ou apenas publicando esse jogo?
IM SOLD!!!!
When this comes out Imma Star Lord main
F Capcom... Its Mahvel Baby...
... doesn't MvC already exist?  What's new on the table?
MCU SKINS PLEAAASEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Eu curti!
I am way to hyped for this game :D
Please let there be iron fist
Arc System Works went from ripping off Marvel to actually making Marvel.
Absolut Videogame!
riot should do something with 2XKO rn
Thank God for PS5 y'all 😂
Marvel version of Dragon Ball FighterZ
Marvel vs Marvel: New Age of Heroes
This reminds me of Dragon Ball FighterZ, might pick up this game because it reminds me of the play style.
Marvel Civil war fighting game
Só e bom por que e feito pro japoneses
Marvel videogames have actually been going crazy, hopefully it continues
So you really think that you can do a marvel vs capcom without capcom?  My boy...  this is not going to be played even in the smash shill saturdays top 8s from their majors.
I really wanted to get mad this isn't MVC but, I can't. This looks f ing awesome.
It would be so awesome to see a proper team Ark-System represented in the Roster with Ragna The Bloodedge and Sol Badguy.
I NEED THIS GAMEEE
They did storm justice I want that skin in marvel rivals🔥🔥
arc system is on fire these past few years props to them
YOOOOOOOOO!
Xbox?????
I don’t care if this game ends up being bad the art style is insane
Wow this looks amazing
Marvel fighter Z
That doom dodge is illegal
PEAK
Well if anything, this will definitely confirms Injustice 3. This just added value to the brand.
Never knew i needed an anime iron man until now. Now it want that as a model kit
I’m gonna be mad if there is no foot dive
🔥🔥🔥
Marvel Ultimate Alliance. You got it right with Marvel Ultimate Alliance, can ya’ll just run that back Marvel? Give me a good story, good beat em up/combo mechanics all my favorite Supes, that’s all we want! Oh and couch co-op would be nice!
It looks like mvc3 but ive grown accept is 2D sprites aint never coming back. That said, ill see whats its goin for upon release
Please tell me there is a 1 vs 1 mode love fighting games but its hard to appreciate when its just a UI overload...even the last MK was a big meh since you can't tag team with a friend and are force to have a tag teamate AI
The cinematic world may have collapsed, but the gaming world of Marvel is going strong.
First Marvel rivals, now this!? Marvel really is the best game company out there, whoever is in charge of games, big well done👏
WEN MAHWEL
SUPAIDAMAN!!!!
When did Spider-Man learn Japanese?
Wonder if there is a chance of collab characters
We got a good playable ghost rider before GTA 6 🥀
Now make Ryu a guest character!
Capcom : Marvel Superheroes 1995  Arcsystem : Marvel Tokon 👏👏👏🤌🤌
FightesZ theme
So arc system works about to embarrass Capcom 😊
It's Marvel vs Capcom but without Capcom
We are soooo back!!!
Mouais.... I`m already tired after have seen the trailer. lol It`s a cacophony fighting like DBZ and smell the DLC pack a lot
Android ke liye bhi game banao yar
CHAOTICALLY FUN!!
This looks really promising
できる限り映画版(キャプテンアメリカ、スターロード)やアニメ版(スパイダーマン、カマラ・カーン)と同じ吹替え声優を起用しているのが嬉しい
One question, where's Magneto?
This is going to be baby's first fighting game, isn't it?
Doom pulled out the glock!!!!! Marvel is back on a generational run!!!!
Why ironman head look like Gundam
4vs4 the final roster is going to be huge and with DLC if the game is popular is going to be INSANE!!
This looks sick!!
Thankyou Marvel, for realizing that American companies just dunno how to make a proper hitting game.  Insane Marvel OW by NetEase China Insane MvC (minus the Capcom part) by ArcSys Japan  Yeah.... Marvel Games department has someone reaaaally smart in there. Good stuff.
DC fans crying rn...
Its supaider-man back in action
after marvel vs capcom various games finally we got "marvel vs marvel"
The fact that they got the GOAT themselves ARCSYS to make this is perfection
You know it got good design and art style when it's East developers make it. Same as Marvel Rivals.
Marvel this game looks amazing! It's like dragon ball fighterz but with Marvel characters!! I don't mind the japanese va but I really hope this game has English voice actors PLEASE. I'm gonna get this collectors edition for this game no doubt!
the va are so good help
It's like Marvel vs Capcom without the Capcom, something we've been waiting a long time for. Looks so good
good, then we can have marvel vs dragonball
Marvel characters speaking Japanese : Cringe Forcing of Ms. Mravel or whatever she is : Mega Cringe
Arc system works? Oh this is about to go so hard…
Why is in japanese? Marvel Super Heroes ( PS1) revives? I don't know, but it's amazing. I'm expecting all the characters
i hope in the future theres invincible game like this
oh-ho-ho-kay...... I NEED TO GET THIS. This looks AMAZING!
Not storm giving the yandere vibes! lol can't wait
Chun-li  get nerf
A marvel fighting game by ARC SYSTEM WORKS!?!? Am I in dream land?  Also, since there is an official 4V4 tag system, can you imagine how the Fantastic 4 will be like?
What in the weebo did I just watch?
This is really cool, but will it come in English?
looks pretty awesome
This actually looks reallly awesome!!
*Marvel Rivals copies Overwatch, and now copies Dragon Ball FighterZ. But ironically, these two have exquisite taste. "It's an elixir!"* 🤌
Marvel vs Capcon pero sin Capcon
Pls have cyclops
This is it
2024: I'm waiting for 2XKO 2025: what the heck is 2XKO, I'm waiting for TOKON now.
We comin’ Straight Outta Latveria with this one
8 base characters and all dlc characters, a failure game
Wonder if goku is trapped in the files of this game as well 😂
I don't know much about Dr. Doom, but he should have a drop kick for this kind of game, doesn't he?
Capcom took too frickin long....Arc had to step up....
Unlike Disney, Marvel is making very smart moves lettings Asian developers make their games because god forbid they chose an American one these days.
storm looks gorgeous as always!!
This looks incredible! Im so happy right now 🎉
DLC from other IPs making this a croosover of sorts would go so hard. IPS that make sense and cater to the FGC ofcourse!
I like this.
This looks so badass!
Marvel vs Xrd ultimate is basically what I saw. 4 man MvC but with GGXrd gameplay.
Beautiful game, I just want this heroes speaking their mother language.
Ok that is amazing, it has the mvsc vibe to it, looking forward to see the rest of the fighters.
Amazing!!!! Im very happy😍😍😍
They chose the worst ghost rider to be in this game
reminds me of marvel vs capcom but better.
Does ArcSys ever miss?  GundamIronBloodedMan 10/10
why they look like that
I’ll buy it on NS2.
Kamala looking cute as hell
I'm still in disbelief that this is real😢
*Well, with the bad news that it ended up being the definitive edition of MK1 and that there's no news of Injustice 3, I suppose a Marvel vs. "Marvel" is more welcome.* 🫡💯
スターロードとキャップMCUとキャスティング同じなのナイスすぎる
Marvel dropping a fighting game right after Multiversus shutdown is some ruthless timing
Playstation exclusive is crazy WoW trying to force players to buy ps5 is nuts
Wow just wow
Wack.....doesn't matter without Black Panther!
Marvel Super Heroes 2.
miss marvel 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Flipo
OH MY
Storm... Oh my...
Hmm… nice
Mole Man, Fantastic Four, Hydro Man, Misty Knight, Paladin, Stilt Man... gimme!
Marvel hold the Capcom
中村！？
Massive Miss Marvel W
I feel James WIllems summoned.
Oh my this one took me back in time. Marvel vs Capcom in the arcade was peak childhood 😭😭
A
Please make the female characters thicc loke marvel rivals 🙏
The first good marvel product in over a decade aside from Marvel Rivals.
cool...but where are Deapool and Wolverine?
esto confirma sin duda que marvel vs capcom MURIO
We got a Marvel fighters game before GTA 6
This game is Free? Or?
Take my money
I can finally stop customizing my Tekken characters into marvel characters
This is fire, they made iron man a gundam
Man. Japanese studio games be looking better than American games 😂
Looks good but why Ironman has a gundam V shape horn?
Please have at least 16-20 characters at launch
Finally the marvel response to injustice, man Capcom should've produced this years ago
Am I clocking this right? Captain America's VA sounds like the JP voice for Trunks, and Ghost Rider's sounds like Diavolo/Ginyu
Spideeeey sense!
😐
Perhaps it was me, but I got some strong 2XKO Ahri Vibes from Storm
Marvel Vs......
DUDE WHATTt I think this is a first day buy from me. Marvel looks like their finally making good decisions again lol
Marvel Vs. Marvel let’s go
Yo Marvel, I PROMISE it's ok to not force a girl character into a badass trailer. It will be ok with just your liked characters, I swear!
Great, another great game that's a stupid exclusive to PS5
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT
Ty arc system, because crapcom kept ignoring the fans hoping for mvc 4
I really like the new character, I'm gonna name her Elastic Woman!
If this game manages to pull enough people, so newbies will have time to have fun with each other and get better. So many other fighting games curb stomp newcomers into despair. Please work, marvel
No more Capcom
This is dope 🔥🔥🔥
Marvel Rivals already has a sequel lol
I don't even play videogames anymore but wow 🔥🔥. Very very impressive.
Marvel without Capcom
4 v 4 makes me believe the roster gotta be big.
Marvel FighterZ
Is this made by the same people who 2XKO? Cause it feels very similar to that
Marvel fans eating good
Congratulations Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls ( Marvel entertainment )  greetings from Indonesia, Number one ☝️🇱🇷🇮🇩 Total: 9/10 ✅🟢
Imagine a team full of spidermans: Spiderman, Venom, Carnage and i don't know who else.  😂😂😂 Greatness Awaits!
EFFING AMAZING
FINALLY A CONSOLE MARVEL FIGHTING GAME!!!!
This looks sooooooo lit!
Finally!
Marvel said bye Capcom... MvC4 was a complete flop, we're going elsewhere D: Well I hope we get Cyclops.
It won't be available for ps4? And xbox
Starlord is Dante 😂
Spaaydahhhmannnn
I love the teams actually  Ms marvel is a huge fan of star lord and also she and spiderman always want to be in friendly fights because of their leaders
We're now in the MGU... (Ominous silence afterwards)
Would prefer FighterZ 2 but this looks sick
Marvel Super Heroes yeeeeei
RIP MARVEL VS CAPCOM
Those japanese voices kinda turn off
What did Spider-Man do in 1:52 to get tag team combo'd like this 🥀
Alright DC step up your game after Multiversus failed (along with your other blunders) and the direction of Mortal Kombat is pretty uncertain, I think its time for another studio other than NRS to do your fighting games.
RiotGames with their upcoming games taking 10 years meanwhile Marvel's out here pumping out every second
It looks like Dragonball fighterZ but with marvel characters.
they finally went back to the anime comic style! I LOVE IT! the voice acting is pretty amazing as well
Marvel fighter z hahaha goooodd
The avengers knew that they could not change society So instead of reflecting on themselves, they blamed thanos  *Heaven or hell*
Wait Gojo?
Marvel fighterz
this looks absolutely insane
It’s like Civil War all over again!
Duuuuuuuuuudeeeeeee!!!!!!
When will they release a manga apart from the comic?
Iron gundam 😂
We got the sequel to Marvel Super Heroes 😮
I think I was ready for Marvel vs Marvel
Played Marvel Super Heroes as a kid and now Marvel Tokon as an adult lets gooo!!
art style is good ngl~
Marvel doing their thing rn 🔥🔥🔥
Uhh yess please
its peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeak
I don't play fighting games, but this? This puts a smile on my face.
Nightcrawler or we riot
OMG 😱
al ver este juego lo único que puedo decir es lo que dijo Gustavo Cerati al final del ultimo concierto de soda stereo:  "GRACIAS TOTALES"
TAKE MY WALLET!
Very, very hopeful but please be in English as well and have good English voice actors. Marvel just feels so wrong in another language 😅
Pretty much a Marvel Street Fighter. I approve!
And the love I have for Arc System Works just keeps growing, I just can't stop smiling every time I look at it, the colors, the character designs, the voice acting, the visual effects, the music, the gameplay, I just can't wait to play this!
captain america with bomber jacket or vest? it goes hard, reminds me of soldier 76
Two questions: will doom foot dive  And will the game have dbfz fighting (as in simple fighting controls)
funny how Eastern Marvel games always look a million times better than western made ones
wait.. why ghot raider sounds like a lil boy T_T
Marvel's Injustice
PLEASE ADD VERGIL AS COLLAB SPECIAL EDITION 😭🙏🏻
Gojo's Japanese voice actor as Captain America is a strange, but welcome choice
man the japanese voice actors carried this game
Looks sick, I gonna suck at it, but I'm still gonna play it
Arc System games are always a treat. Marvel really truly cook with this one.
its guilty gear gameplay but with marvel characters
✋🗿✋
Now Marvel is marveling
Marvel Vs Capcom: Capcom is missing
It feels like Marvel hates Xbox
Somebody just got hired at Marvel and decided they're going to line their pockets with money.
Peach Momoko bout to go crazy on this one
why spider-man always getting ganged up😭
MARVEL DBZ FIGHTERZ
this looks LIT ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
Why not for Xbox
Please don't let this be a one button masher. Give me launcher and I'm in
So its Marvel without the Capcom, I like it
When I was 12, I would stand in the small town Wal-Mart entry area and would watch and play the Marvel Superheroes arcade machine for hours. I've been a FGC diehard in my heart ever since, but I've never tried hard enough to get legit competitive with the world.  This changes that.
So no capcom vs marvel then.
I’m loving the anime energy in the voice lines like they are saying their abilities as they use them…
iron man's suit is scrumptious man
Marvel getting consent banger games vs DC who hasn’t had a truly good game since 2015…
I can’t tell if this is marvels fault or capcoms fault for dropping the ball and making this marvel super heros
Redesigning the movesets for classic characters, pushing the boundary to 4v4, and hopefully adding more characters that haven't been fully in a vs before.  If MvC has to retire  for this, its the right way to pass the torch.  I only hope they can bring back and rejuvenate as many of the classics as possible while bringing new blood.   Do Loki justice.  rip footdive, fingerlasers, and airdash magneto
DID DOOM PULL OUT A GLOCK!?!?!!?!!
This game better have Deadpool and Wolverine
This is just cel shaded FighterZ
Why do they keep making the same game over and over? Can't they come up with something more? 😢
Doctor Doom pulling out that revolver though 😆🤣 loved it
Can I get an artbook with this art style please? 🥺🥺❤️
Okay this good👍🏾
Hypeeeee 🎉🎉
Crackheads ready to rumble GO! The video game
Bloody 'ell, so many screen slow down/freezes and such, never been gladder to not be a Marvel guy
こういいうコッテコテになった見た目好き！！
Supaidaman!
did they do 4v4 specifically to have all the fantastic four in there at once? that's crazy, though.
DC has Injustice Marvel has this
We have Marvel vs Capcom at home :
I noticed that they are speaking Japanese
Marvel is cooking guys
never expected anime x marvel collab
Keep paying Eastern Game Devs, Marvel
When’s Mahvel
is doom a grappler(please say yes)
✨👌🏼
I swear to god if Superman isn’t amazing I’m done being a DC fan bro. Getting Arc Sys on a Marvel fighting game is absolutely crazy work. Plus pretty much keeping it a secret until reveal in this day and age means they got real faith in this
I love that modern marvel games have the swagger of the comics
Civil war map please
The game still incomplete to me without Cyclops he's my go to guy in MvC hopefully in future trailet they'll introduce him or Wolvie
i trust arc system works for fighting game
Were eating good💔🥹
Marvel Fighterz!
Marvel rivals Marvel Xrd Strive  It's a great day to be not just a Marvel fan, but to be alive.
Smart move 🔥🤌
Please make the combo game like MK dial-a-combo system.
Godlike stuff.
marvel movies might suck now but my lord they are not slacking with games now, rivals now this
Still want a netherrealm studios marvel game so bad 😢
Welcome back Guilty Gear Strive (Marvel Edition) 😂😂😂
Is that freaking Robbie Reyes?!?
No Deadpool and Wolverine?
Capcom: Mr. Marvel… I don’t feel so good
Why japanese? American company and American comics. So strange. That would be like doing a manga comic in western style animation with American voice actors. Who would buy that?
It's very much in the style of Street Fighter, I think it's going to be a good game but it's probably only going to be released for PS5 and new generation consoles.
Marvel vs Marvel: Fate of 1 World
LOVING THE NEW IRON MAN ARMORR
Qe loco qe hayan usado la voz de Kazuma en spiderman, eso significa qe si lo lanzan al latino posiblemente Javier Olguin le dé voz a Peter Parker
I just want the Hulk!
ew kamala khan
Blown away..... No words...
Marvel fighterz
No Xbox series😢
Yes give the license to eastern devs and don't restrict their creative, so we get things like this and Rivals.
i want to beat captain marvel 😊
literally MVCU4 but just Marvel
Creí que iba ser un rpg por lo chino xd
The dream game I wasn’t able to dream. My GG doing marvel. Best birthday gift man
It's cool and all, but it's not a true Japanese Spider-Man if he doesn't have a gun
It’s MAHVEL BAYBEE!!
no Capcom... 4v4... Marvel vs Capcom 3 was 3v3
1:22 DOCTOR DAN HAS A GUN!!!!
Should’ve been Marvel versus Capcom with this
Yes sir im getting this
Hopefully this gets dubbed Sub elitists need not reply
1:23 aint no way they just strapped him with some heat and called it that, i love it
We will get this before GTA.
is doom doing a jo jo refreance? 2:04
this art!!! this collaboration!!!! what a time to be a gamer.!!!
So no one piece FighterZ?
Man this give me old arcade vibes like something straight from the 00s.  As a dc fan wish WB would make cool games like this with the justice league.
FGC in a state of we are so back and its so over.
Alright! If hitting 2 characters is considered a "Happy Birthday," and hitting 3 characters is considered a "Merry Christmas." What are we gonna call it when you hit all 4 characters?
This looks so fun. The best part is that this genre and style would only make it worth $49.99 with the DLC packs.
Words can’t express my excitement to see playable Ms Marvel, Robbie Reyes Ghost Rider, and Star-Lord.  It gives the feeling that the roster is gonna be pulling from all over and not just the usual staples.
Daaaang my girl storm is in another game
Wow 🤯 yes yes yes 🤤
Got my hopes up thinking it would be a Marvel Super Smash Bros... street fighter style is lame in comparison I think.
Ugh, Ms Marvel? Why not add any of the Young Avengers if they want teen characters? They are so superior to her constant attempt to be quirky.😩
I hope it's more than 10 characters
MVFZ!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
JOJO X ASW WHEN ?
Praying for Slapstick and Impossible Man 🙏
Interesting that the characters don’t seem to be sharing actors with Rivals. Like Storm is so clearly Miyuki Sawashiro here, but she played Hela in Rivals.
2:01 When they made zoom in on her face because of the Super attack start up i thought they white wash Ms. Marvel, thank god they didn't.
So long Capcom! Let's Go!!!!
I can't help but feel a little disappointed they got a team like Arc System Works doing the game, but didn't spring for a gorgeous pseudo-2D art style that makes everyone look like they hopped off an actual comic page.
I am a known hater and this still looks rad
…..shut up and take my money.
This will feed generations
IT'S MAHVEL BAYBEEEE
Japanese rivals
This is so 🔥
Doom has basically unlimited power and yet he still chooses to use a Glock. Respect 🫡
2:07 ghost rider 😳👀
"Aku arep tokon" "Tokon apa?"  Sorry, it's just a joke. "Takon" means "ask" in Javanese (not Japanese) 😅
If this is free you have my praise
ArcsysDEIDAD ✋😭✋
E a capcom ?
they really said Marvel No Capcom
鋼鐵人 頭加了一個V 變成 鋼彈洛克鋼鐵人  挺帥的😂 這型態希望出一只玩具
I like how doom just change the music when he appeared
NOOOO I WANT CAPCOM NYA UWUW AKAKAKAKHHHHHHH NYA RAWR
LOL, this would eat up Riot's fighting game who is still on the development stage. 🤣
This looks amazing
I’m a little concerned if they don’t have English version
We're not going to talk about how hot they made Storm?  Okay.
First rivals as a hero shooter, now this as a fighting game. We are COOKING MARVEL! Now just keep up with the MCU
I loved the part where Dr. Doom pulls out a futuristic Leuger    And shoots the hell outta Ghost Rider
OH GOD IT'S EVERYWHERE
Marvel vs Capcom - Capcam + Marvel = Hell yea!
What I love about FighterZ is how they choose the roster and make a really worthy and cool iteration of it. Seems like they do the same with this one.
Horikoshi character art??
This looks like straight GAS ⛽️ 😤
Cool, but I am waiting for 2XKO.
Why do these people keep trying to make Kamala Kahn happen? Her comic sales were abysmal, her show was poorly received, her powers are the same as Mr. Fantastic, and her back story is just plain dumb. If they made her a villain with the power to create explosions every time she said a certain phrase, she would be way more interesting and way more realistic.
Cyclops better be in this
Arkham is a better game, DC is better
I understood 7 words...but these hands are a universal language!
After making MvsC, It took them super long time to make this ngl.
They gave iron man a v-fin.He's totally a gundam...or veautiful.
Am so happy rn
アークならきっとサクラ・スパイダーも出してくれるはず
Marvel FighterZ 😂
Why not hulk and thor 😮😢
not switch or xbox = trash
So I guess were never gonna get a marvel vs capcom game again
We just need Injustice 3 and it will be a wrap!!!! Fighting games are back.
We got rivals at home buddy
I have hope for the next marvel vs. capcom…
Emma Frost please! 💎
If u add Daredevil and Moon Knight u have my money
SKEPTICAL 🤨  I got bored of strive 👀 but I've been playing marvel 3 still to this day
Seriously I thought Disney owned rights to marvel why am I seeing so many games from other countries being made with marvel characters ? 🤯
They added spider-man in this thank God
ARC SYS GAMES IM SCREAMING
I have so many questions...
Please...PLEASE let this have a version of "i wanna take you for a ride" in the character select or VS screen. That's my anthem.
Xbox ?
A Marvel game I can finally get behind. I love me an Arcsys fighter!
Well this looks AMAZING!!!😮 But it also means no MVC4 anytime soon.😢
R.I.P. MvC (finally)
I feel like Marvel figured out that eastern devs are the way to go with their games
OOOMFG!!!! YEEEEEES
Looks sick
Marvel meets Guilty Gear Strive
Its Mavel baby!!!!
Marvel has been on a crazy campaign lately
Yep DC games are in trouble
Marvel contest but worse 😂
Are they just making a marvel version of Injustice?
Anime always wins
First Marvel gave us their own Overwatch now they’re giving us their own Street Fighter what will they give us next?
Robbie!!!
良いですね〜
MVC died for this...
DAY 1 BABY  + The new Fighting game controller!!!
Ah yes, *_UNMARVEL_*
Wow!!! The return of MARVEL SUPERHEROES in Arcade the pure Marvel characters battle.
Absolutely beautiful.
And let’s all remember to be grateful that it was Arc System Works that got chosen
captain japan america?
Not coming to Xbox? Okay, marvel, not gonna watch your F4. Go on with your building walls for gamers.
PLEASE JUST SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
This is gonna be epic🎉
🔥 trailer
Bien ahí Capcom, era hora que te ponga las pilas, con los juego de Marvel 😎👌🏿
Be a huge roster plz plz plz  And not filler characters no one knows. “Oh snap! Did you see they announced Tree Lady?!?!”
so when is the next Marvel Vs. Capcom game?
I'm more a DC fan, but this game looks lit.
CAN WE GET A MARVEL HEROES ONEGA 2 ALREADY INSTEAD OF A FIGHTERZ COPY!??!???!?
dude dude dude!!! Mark-G or Mark-RX-78-2 should be the name of that armor! THIS GAME LOOKS BRUTAL!!!
I NEED THIS NOW!!!!
IT'S MAHVEL BAYBEE!!!!!!!!!
Dragon ball fighterz hell ya
Personajes que me gustaría ver en este juego: - Deadpool - Wolverine  - Captain Marvel (Carol Damvers) - Hulk - Black widow - Thor - Hawkeye - Falcón  - Black Panter
Waiting for sentry
They really think having a 4v4 tag team is new and innovative it’s nothing special dawg. These people are funny. 😂  Not really excited for this as a Marvel fan that wanted a 3D fighter over the other dozens of 2D ones. So i’m gonna wait and see how this game’s lifespan turns out.
Awesome ❤
What a crap 🤮
Arc Systems??? Oooo Hoping for some really complex gameplay
BRO
Woaaah!!
I'll be very upset if Dr. Doom doesn't have his "Foot Dive" and "Foot Stomp"😒😒😒😒
Want the original miss Marvel.
WE ARE SO BACK!
THIS GAME WAS MADE BY THE DEVS OF GUILTY GEAR?!?!?!!!😱😱😱
Where capcom cuhh
first marvel rivals now this. marvel video games are on a dub streak
Hmm this game reminds me of another game, look like this will be my new rival
Dude me in the entire video: "gusebumps"
Yo Marvel is cooking with these new games
Ghost Raida 💀🔥
4v4 is wild
This looks cool and all, but I’m confused why are they speaking Japanese?
Yes!!! Marvel 4 looks incredible!  They respected the source material and made it totally new!!!
Interesting but i hope this will come to all consoles and same with all the other marvel games.
iron man is not gundam
absolutely incredible
I’m loving the Dragonball Fighters mechanics with the Marvel vibe. This game looks🔥🔥🔥
Ms Marvel is looking like an actual anime girl now
0:56 Ok Dante
Mahvel Baby!!
1:33 is that Robot’s LOIC from Yomi Hustle?? If Doom makes it as the game’s grappler I’m buying it Day 1
Sheesh they cooking
no daredevil?
Hulk?
Almost everything I wanted. The only negative about this is that it’s not a super smash bros style fighter but I still dig it.
Love how 1:07 they just put a fur collar on star lord and the look is immediately more badass. I would not screw wit a masked focker with a white fur collar
A good looking marvel game and ofc it’s a Pc and Ps5 exclusive 😐
ps5 finally has a game
Why is a U.S. IP being shown to English Speakers in gobbledygook, that's like Ubisoft licensing Gundam IP and showing the game with everyone speaking french..
Marvel got tired of waiting for capcom. ITS MARVEL v MARVEL BABY!!!
I’m all in.
First Marvel vs Marvel game since Marvel Super Heroes
Excuse me? Sony thank you , capcom is cooked.
First Rivals, now this. Finally I don't have to turn on my 360 or my ps2 to play a decend Marvel themed game
An Emisarry From Hell, Supaidaman !!
I hope Spiderman's voice actor is actually Yasuhisa Furuhara (aka sosuke esumi from engine sentai go-onger). If he isn't, oh well, but he would fit it perfectly since he likes fully impersonate a character to the max.
なんかキャラデザダサいなw
Will this play similarly to marvel v capcom? Maybe I should brush up on my overall skills lol
R.I.P 2XKO
DOOM WITH THE LUGER?!
Amazing!
ITS MAHVEL BABY??!? BUT NOT REALLY BUT ACTUALLY FOR REAL?
Guilty Gear, Blazblue, DBFZ, Granblue and now Marvel. Arc sys + fighting games are just an unstoppable force no matter the ip.
Marvel super heroes 30th anniversary, with japanese voice is perfect, please release tô Switch 1 !
This looks dope!!! 🔥 🔥
IT'S MAHVEL BAYBEE!
Finally japanese supaidaman is back!!
Will this have both Japanese and English voice work?
gilty gear marvel?
ah yes, MARVEL FighterZ
Just see trailer,,, already know game will be great success ,,, Famous Roster, new gameplay etc etc Ie the most important, no capcom street fighter here,  Marvel enough can have their own universe,
FighterZ mods are becoming insane!
Bit of a mixed bag for me. On the one hand it looks very sick esthetically. I'm not a huge fan of the Gundam Iron Man. The 4v4 element worries me and the history of DBFZ's balance is worrying.
現時点で判別できるキャスト（敬称略） 過去作からの引き継ぎ キャップ（MCUの中村悠一） アイアンマン（アベンジャーズアッセンブルの川原慶久） スターロード（MCUの山寺宏一） ミスマーベル（PS4アベンジャーズの黒木ほのか） スパイダーマン（アニメアルティメット版の川田紳司） 以下は今作の新規キャスト？ ゴーストライダー（小西克幸） ストーム（沢城みゆき） ドゥーム（土師孝也）
Marvel fighterz
where's magik
I thought it would be more tekken like 😅
They need to give them theme songs
This is what Capcom deserves to see happen, because what on earth was Marvel vs Capcom infinite?!? They pretty much flushed the vs series down the drain after umvc3
They could do the same thing smash did and add a cross next to another IP like Capcom , SNK, Nintendo or anything they want and add it to the base roster, I think this could be the base game for Marvel VS everyone.
I wish fighting games about comics and anime would stick to the 1v1 2D format. This tag team trend is a big letdown 😞  At least it isn't arena, like most anime fighting games nowadays.
Omg Storm😊😊😊😊
Hell Yes!!! So hype! Looks like another win for the east lol.
Project L From Riot Games copy
Immediatly when i saw the trailer i just knew it max would be flipping in the air doing 360°
I didn't see that coming
This game isn't even out yet and it's already better than MVCI
Ight! Looks dope!
This is Like Street Fighter Eh? I like that.
Quien te conoce Kings of Fighter
Finally we see some elements out from star lord's element blaster lol
Somebody over at Marvel Studios has been gaining a lot of Life XP lately.
IS STARLORD DIO?
PLEASE HAVE A HUGE ROSTER!! Many seasons to come please!!!
hmm, I dont like that they locked the game to specifically be 4v4...I dont imagine thats gonna change since its literally in the description in trailer but I mean...come on. You cant play 1v1 or something? I doubt it, but would love for it to have similar modes to Injustice 2, with a story, and alot of PVE content, im not a fan of PVP, but like fighting games.
IT'S MAHVEL BABY!!!!
Storm looks so fine and gorgeous 😍 not to mention the actual fighting looks epic
A marvel game made my Arcsys was all I literally asked for years ago, I'm so happy it's finally happening.
star lord literally just reuses dante's ultimate animation💀💀 i dont even play MVC but i caught that
For some reason the character models don’t look that great
and xbox?
I'm sorry MVC fans, I prefer this more than MVC 4, I'm so sorry. But, just because a full Marvel Fighting Game is a thing now, doesn't mean it decomfirms MVC 4, it will still happen, just not this year.
And finally we don't have to worry about this having an awkward roster or good characters like thor being made bad on purpose like slow with high health
This looks amazing
So this is what Marvel vs Capcom Infinite could have been.
FINALLY FINALLY. YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Japanese Spider-Man? Could it be? LEOPARDON?!
*SPiDEYYYYYYY SENSEu* ‼️
Coming 2026 😭😭😭
So just marvel fighterz?
Marvel FighterZ ❤️❤️
Entonces esto significa que no more Capcom?
First Marvel Rivals, then this!? Marvel is cooking in the game department
They knew what they was doing with storm
Guys where is Capcom?
Arc System Works making a Marvel fighter 🤤
Dragon Ball FighterZ but Marvel
ARC AYSTEM WORKS LET'S GOOOOOOOOO
From marvel versus captain to marvel versus marvel 🎉🎉🎉
They all look awful
Need to see doctor strange and Hulk
i am so hyped for Marvel tokon fighting souls it looks amazing.
Can't wait to see the competitor, "Capcom Vs Capcom" announced at Summer Game Fest
This looks so freaking good, it reminds me of MvsC:2 in th eway the animations work.
This game and Marvel Rivals are the only Marvel works that give Storm the respect and design she deserves
4v4 is gonna be pure chaos and I am all for it
Bring back the "I'm gonna take ya' for a ride" globe.
Dam this looks freaking awesome
It's Marvel Baby
this game if made right, will be marvelous game ever, with updates or upgrades on game and collab with capcom and other verse, unlimited potential and future updates.
Well I guess Xbox fans gotta suffer😢
Storm se ve genial
So Marvel FighterZ? SOLD!
This looks great! Now make a new great alliance😂
This is so excelsior!
Miyuki Sawashiro as Storm? Sounds like her.
Awesome!!!! I can't wait for more characters to be revealed! Personally, I thought it was prettier than Fatal Fury and Street Fighter VI! I loved it, and I'm not even a big fan of fighting games!
This is basically FighterZ but Marvel, and I love it.
This game looks, FANTASTIC
Ok but.. I just need Ryu and Chun li
I’ve watching this no less than 30x. UNREAL
Need the song that was playing. 🔥🔥
I suck at fighting games but I wanna play this!!
SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!! SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!! POR FIN LPM!!!!!!!!!!! SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!
Marvel fighterz Z
Max is going to flip when he see's this
Civil War the Fighting Game!
I can't wait to have a team of X-Men. Cyclops, Wolverine, Storm and Phoenix please
PLEASE HAVE SPECIAL INPUTS PLEEEEEEEEEEEEASE
Will it have duos?
just sounds 10x better in Japanese
Dragonball VS Marvel !!!!
Ms Marvel looks amazing ❤❤❤
This is so cool!
Marvel gaming fans eating good these days! That last MvC game was trash, so I'll take this. Looks like classic Street Fighter vibes with a Marvel focus. I'm in day one!
BRO WHAT!? THIS IS SO SICK
YOOOOOOOOO
GOD DAM!……Marvel asked for a win and Arc System Works will deliver!
i can already see it. the game gets announced and is loved to death but when the game comes out. its gonna get hated to death. seems to be a cycle
Marvel con doblaje japones?! Dame Más!!!!
SPIDEY-SENZU!
Finally a storm not in mohawk
And PLEASE PLEASE for the love of humanity, REMOVE this stop motion system after every connecting hit, it's super annoying and feels like playing a stuttering game.
i hope Arc makes a Naruto game next
I definetly cried....
the question is : there is  a corner in this game...right?...right????
Oh marvel version of injustice
Iron man Look like a Gundam Man
finally a tekken like marvel fighting game lets go
Ghost Rider Robbie Reyes
Well this feels more like the final nail in the coffin for MVC, I think there will never be another one after the Infinite fiasco.
Excelente, esperemos ark system mejore lo que capcom rompio, con sus DLC y juegos incompletos
I'm not gonna lie i playef DBFZ casually, and never really played arcs games but this is what we been waiting for Capcom/Marvel-Disney Definitely Dropped the combo on this one.
anoter Arc system slop, get ready for 8 characters on launch and $500 on garbage dlc
i’ve never played a marvel fighting game how does this work
If people only knew how long some fans have wanted a pure MARVEL Versus game with no Capcom!  It's going to be weird to see old favorites with a whole new moveset (part of me was just hoping to see Photon Array when Doom showed up, lol)
pls psiclops   pls
Marvel outside: Cooking  ✅️  Meanwhile, Marvel at home: Dying cinematic universe, cancelled projects, no comic sales ☠️
Shuma Gorath or bust
Got a feeling it’s going to be a marvel year next year and the next . I ain’t mad.
Ah yes. . . it's time
I hope the roster has some deep cuts I wanna see some fresh designs for long forgotten characters
This looks so dope!! 🔥🔥😊
What's sad about this is this means we won't be seeing MvC5 for a long long time
please have a heavy selection of x-men🤞🏽
ARC SYSTEM WORKS ‼️
Arcsys we really need this matchmaking to be good
The design of Ms Marvel looks very cute this time around  Her cheeks are really chubby looking
May you please not make this game expensive? If so, i would love.
Seeing ghost rider and doom here… I really hope they bring them to rivals
Que delícia hein ❤❤❤ não vi já amei
Plis add ghost rider jhonny blaze 💀🔥
Wolverine ??? What a fish 🤦404 error
Only 8 heroes?
Marvel Rivals now this? 😍
seizures are underrated
Make it for andriod and ios devices
This looks fire
Whens Mahvel is back!
finally a game where spidey uses his spider senses properly
EAST LA finally has a rep in both a Marvel game and a game made by one of the leads in anime fighting games. What a time to be alive.
Why not MvC4 with xmen characters. This still looks good but probably going to be huge milk cow, like 8 character starter pack and 5$ per character onward
Sold.
Whoever runs this shi better stay in that dang chair cause they are COOKING 🍳 🥘🧑‍🍳!!!
Marvel fighterz basically and I love it , real skill will be in effect again
Is that Miyuki Sawashiro doing Storm?! How fitting for her to get another lightning character.
Marvel minus Capcom
I have been asking for a proper assist marvel fg since mvc3 🥲 this is legit looking like a dream game for me, just hope the 4v4 execution is good and those forward dashes aren’t invincible
Awesome game. I’m hoping for Isiah Bradley Captain America 🔥
Its marvel baby!
Dragon Ball FighterZ, which was ArcSystem's "Marvel Vs. Capcom", is now developing another tag team fighter with Marvel Comics, a 4 Vs. 4 at that. Capcom has serious competition now.
I can see it now, everyone finding the strongest projectile based fighters and zoning their way to victory.
I just love how dr doom just pulls out a literal GUN
I love the art style 😍😍😍
Marvel Fighterz go crazy
STREET FIGHTER MARVEL WARS 😅
Am so..happy 😢
If this is on PlayStation 4 I’m never going to sleep again
The Avengers now have their own Injustice game.
Yeah... It's not looking good for 2XKO...
2XKO killer !!!
4 Heroes vs 4 Heroes  Might as well play as… The Fantastic Four! 🎺
Can't wait for Hasbro to do a gameverse with tis one
Marvel vs. Cap….  Wait, what?!
Day one....
This game gonna flop watch.
1:01 Jackpot 😉
Now we know why there's no new FighterZ 2 or a MvC game.
Discount tekken
Arc studios is baller. 👍
Dang if only Dante and Vergil will be included
rip project L
The rosters finna be huge by year 3
Más allá de que claramente es un marvel vs capcom (que no es capcom, porque vaya a saber qué pasó detrás)- Se ve MUY bien, y tiene pinta de que va a ser divertido de jugar.
everyone got this new fancy design meanwhile Doom is still rocking his comic drip
I all of a sudden forgive arcsys for the ggst dlc delays
Arc sys really said, "If you not making Mahvel 4, we'll make it ourselves"
they got the graphics RIGHT!!!!! i'm hyped for this game, this new 4Pvs4P will be awesome!! A lot of rage quit xD
Did he just say “spidey sense!” Like it’s an attack? 🤨
Thanks Dragonball Fighters
Omggg is this real
Duuude! As if Marvel Rivals wasn’t epic enough, we get this! It looks fricking awesome!
Another day, another Marvel game with no Iceman in it.....😔😔
Marvel Civil War, the game.
1:58-2:11 these are ultimate attacks? 😮
I hope Magik is in this game. I main her in rivals and maybe this.
:Xbox is better than playstation  :Arc system No.
Why no Xbox?
Japanese Marvel game and no Nico Minoru or Penni Parker? Rude
Please dont flop like bbtag... please please please
As long as this doesn't play like BBtag we good
Gundam Iron Man model kit 🤔
rip mvc4
We’re never getting a One Piece FighterZ are we 🥲
Woah! A Marvel Superheroes Fighting Game by ArcSys!!
Bro ArcSys really killed MvC twice. First they killed MvCI with Dragonball FighterZ. Now, they killed any momentum and hype for MvC4 by releasing this. Wild.
2XKO who...? Lol.
Can't wait for weebs to complain about the English dub and how the original Japanese is better and the *true* way to experience the characters.
Injustice 3 trailer incoming...😂
Missed chance to have our favourite Supaidaman in the game. The Emissary From Hell would have fit right in.
I literally nearly had an asthma attack when Ghost Rider appeared. So excited for this.
I was crushed this wasn’t Wolverine
Since Tokon is a 4 on 4 Game, Please Add The Fantastic 4 on the Roster.
Hold on; did he said "The Messenger from Hell, Spiderman"?
On one hand, I’m beyond excited   On the other hand, this might confirm we are never getting another Marvel vs Capcom 😔
El verdadero Marvel vs
Guilty Marvel Superheroes XX The Midnight Brawl.
MAGIK PLEASE
Close enough, Welcome back MVC!
I'd prefer Reed over Kamala as a character, but I don't mind it.
Nice. Definitely will buy.
2026 🙄
MCU is having a tough time lately, but Marvel Games are having a renaissance
Yo Marvel!
Marvel minus Capcom?!
yeah mk is done
arc sistems work? SO ARE GETTING A SONG FOR EVERY CHARACTER??   also it makes me so sad to see marvel girl, so we are not getting mr fantastic?
Promete esse jogo
God god god god  Dc ponte pilas 🗣🔥🔥
Featuring Captain America as Gojo Satoru
Can't wait to hear Scarlet Witch say Ara Ara.
They turned iron man into a gundam
Long have I waited. Finally, a Marvel only fighting game. Also, teams of 4 is gonna be crazy. X-Men, Fantastic Four, Avengers, Sinister Six, etc.
Please give us MVC with this one this looks beautiful
Captain’s voice actor is same as Gojo and Bucciarati btw
BROOOO THIS IS SO PEAKKK
Finally a real sequel to xmen children of the atom
The first quadruple A fighting game
Storm looks phenomenal.
すごい！
.....YES.....
So where's BlazBlue?
Arc system works! Another hit to add to the list.🎉
This visuals are beatifully chaotic!
Looks cool but feels like this will turn out to be DNF Duel 2... ArcSys doesn't seem to care about anything other than their cherry on top GGST right now.... Fingers crossed tho... looks cool asf
Isnt this just another marvel vs capcom / xmen? the moveset looks the same. Not that i mind tho.
Your Movies Suck. But this will do! Let Arc Sys do this. Keep your fingers out of this! It's MAHVEL BABY!
4 v 4?! as a gamer boomer, I just can't. Every new gameplay mechanic in this generation just wants to add STRESS!!!
The Dream!
NGL. That looks sick. Definitely on the watch list
Y mi CAPCOM T.T
Why marvel IP PlayStation exclusive ! ?
Does it play like mvc or dbfz?
This looks so good it almost made me forget that Marvel is owned by Disney.
marvel fighter z....
Please put black panther in this game
MARVEL WHEN I CATCH YOU MARVEL
DOOM DO A FOOT D8VE PLS!!
Cap is definitely Gojo VA
IT SHOULDVE BEEN NARUTO 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Marvel + Arc system works = blast, but i hate tag team from bottom of my heart
marvel this cool but please just make MvC4 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Bakit mukhang Gundam si ironman
me gusta
Arch system knows how to make fighting games better than capcom.
I wish I was good at games like these because this looks great. Just too sluggish on commands and they won’t go thru🤷‍♂️
Marvel vs Capcom with no Capcom
I've waited my whole life for green goblin in a fighting game, please make it happen
ArcSys always cooking a feast
Doom got a blicky
Oh wow.  a marvel videogame
We are in good hands....
Surprisingly Otaku
So help me GOD Marvel. This better be coming, and not just tickling the tip of my anticipation...
Minha nossa senhora dos gráficos ★-★
Marvel games is cooking so hard
I got so hyped.
Marvel game with jp voiced trailer? Lol
Why is this not just Marvel Vs Capcom 4?
What is 2xko? never heard of it?
The fact this plays somewhat exactly like Dragon Ball Fighterz makes me feel so happy because I love playing DBF.
I think they copied the gameplay mechanics of DragonBall FighterZ.
Marvel is getting into anime again
Robbie Reyes Ghostrider instead of Johnny Blaze?
IronGundaman
Dude, the character designs are awesome
ahahahahah 2xKO is cooked xdd
OMG it's the Japanese Supaidaman!!!!!! 🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
Finally a W from Marvel and of course it is because of Japanese studio
Hell yea this will be fun! Another game gaybox people r going to miss out on 😂 😂
Aside from digimon this is what saved the state of play for me
Marvel r34 is eating goooooooddd
Serves Capcom right since they don’t wan’t to give us a proper MVC game
You know what will boost the sales of this game? A guest real life football player and a DJ character /s
WOOOOAAAAHH 😍😍😍
Nintendo makes Bloodbourne 2 Ark makes Marvel vs Capcom 4  Thanos: I'll do it myself.
I hope storm has a color where her skin is lighter. She looks too black in the default costume
Marvel minus Capcom
Besides, I feel that the fights will go on for too long in a 4vs4.
Doctor Doom sounded like Heihachi a bit... Kinda fitting tho...
Me when Peter take his mask of and he looks like Kirito: ( ಠ⁠_⁠ʖ⁠ಠ)   Pd: I'm already looking for the wishlist
PLEASE RELIESE IT TOO ON MOVILE 😭😭
Now do a MOBA please
Marvel Rivals: A Worthy Opponent! Our Battle Will Be Legendary
I need She Hulk in this game A S A P Always trust arcsys to make the best anime fighters 🥹
same fighter z, and 90 dlc. for character. maybe in 2027 the game have full character edition. and 0 player online. (fighter z have 100 player now),
Storm's design and voice is perfection.
Yo spider man look sick
They Gundamified Iron Man 😭
Injustice in a nutshell
DLC gonna be lit! Also the price!
絶対買います！ガンビット、サイロック、ケーブルも登場してほしい！マーベルのキャラは日本でも人気があるからね～
1:55 F-F-FOOTDIVE
SPIDERMAN SPEAKING JAPANESE  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Dr. Doom's teleport is broken
Where foot dive
Looks a lot like dragonball fighterz, one of my favourite games
Better be for xbox also
Yooooo Doom pulled out the mauser to shoot ghost rider in the face point blank 🤣
Finally they have an answer to DC's injustice.🔥
Maveru Tokon
Tokōn is just a few letters short and off from Tekken 🤔
Uy no Capcom, te comieron el mandado.
Supaidaman!
PlayStation stay winning
God I wish I knew how to play fighting games
Marvel anime fighters looks awesome
Gimme Phoenix, Mystique, Magik gimme a million characters for this Sony grahhhhhhhhhhh
Marvels actually cooking with their games?! It’s a good time to be a marvel fan.
Just add the fantastic four to this game and my money is yours
Who else thinks this Star Lord is actually memorable here.
Ahahahaha el descaro!!!  Usaron las frases de rugal y de ryu!!!! Ahahahaha
Whoever is that Doctor Doom voice actor is, deserves a raise.
Cable better be in this
Finally a Marvel fighting game Let's gooooooooo
I hope the rooster as big as Ultimate Alliance
Marvel vs Marvel is like Civil War
It’ll have a bigger roster than Sparking Zero do trust 😌 I’ll play this game forever…and ever…Sony you finally cooked 🫡
Japanese Captain America 🎉
they gave iron man a v-fin….  he looks like a red aerial
And like always us at Xbox be like 💀
Finally Marvel vs Syreet fighter games
If they don't put F4 in this 4v4 would be a crime. Also I'd expect Deadpool in and him saying, "Wait why am I talking in Japanese?"😂😂😂
I like everything but all this pausing that takes me out of the flow of the match.
LO PREDIJEEEE XD
WE'RE SO BACK
Ok marvel…you’ve been tryin to push Robbie Reyes for YEARS…!…..STAWP IT!!!!!
This trailer looks like Capcom filed for divorce with Marvel after Marvel vs Capcom Infinite lol
They turned Iron Man into a Gundam. I love it.
Netherrealm studies couldn’t do it… so Marvel took things into their own hands!
Oh man I need this
This is the game that we’ve always wanted!!!! 🥹
Arc systems is the best studio that could have made this game!!
1:35 Rukia, that you?
Looks great but why waste a roster spot on Kamala Khan when she can’t sell a comic to save a life?
Such an easy slam dunk for Sony, this will be as big as Marvel Rivals is. Street Fighter 6…it’s over. Wouldn’t be surprised if this becomes the most popular fighting game on the planet. Marvel is back…again!
Marvel Gear?
Looks very good, but 4v4 tag seems mentally draining. Hopefully they include 1v1 and 2v2.
Not something I’d ever play but the variety is welcome
4v4 cause theres 8 playable characters
THIS MARVEL VS CAPCOM ON STEROIDS! SHEESH! 🔥
Y’all cooking keep it up
Marvel vs MCU
All this Marvel vs Capcom mentions while I am here thinking this is Guilty Avengers: Tag Team
Best looking fighter since MvC2
What?! They FINALLY got an Arcsys Marvel fighting game??? Been dying for this since BlazBlue continuum shift! I’m so excited. Can’t wait to see the roster evolve and get some of my favorites going nuts on the screen. X-Men COTA is one of my favorites and now it’ll get topped by this! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Starlord's super exactly like Dante's
Is it free?
It's beautiful, but it's not Marvel vs Capcom 😞
The REAL Marvel vs. Capcom 4, but there isn't Capcom anyway.
FGC 2018: DB fighterZ is the true Marvel vs capcom FGC 2025: We've come full circle.
Marvel vs Arcsys
This is going to be short lived
So close! Just missing the Capcom characters
I will live to 2026 to play this 🫡
I DIDN'T EXPECT ACR SYSTEM TO MAKE A MARVEL FIGHTING GAME  But still no BB 😮‍💨
What timeline did I just enter?! This is CRAZY!!! Is this a reboot of the Vs series?? Will this lead to Marvel vs ASW? The possibilities are insane.
Wooooah looks cool!
DLC characters sales for years. “Here comes the money”💰💵🤑
I'm just here for Storm (and the other X-Men). Arc System Works is going to do far more justice to her abilities than Capcom ever dared to do.🌪⚡️  And they made Spider-Man a counter stance character using his spider-sense?! GENIUS!🕸
Wolverine is dlc
This looks amazing!
Bro marvel taking over gaming industry
This game is going to be awesome!!!!!! 🤩. Ghost Rider and Doctor Doom are amazing!!!
Marvel vs  capcom..... :((
I... I need Marvel anime...
Instring
Sucks that it’s not on Xbox, that’s absolutely wild.
2XKO: **nervous breathing**
For those curious 闘魂 (TOKON) means "Fighting Spirits". They just adjusted it to "Souls"
Haven't been this excited for a Arc System game since Central Fiction 😊👏👏👏
this game looks fired❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥😩😩 but i hope the interactions are even more epic.
First Cosmic Invasion and now this Marvel fans are eating well tonight
So the romance with Capcom ended, I see.
Why are we putting Marvel games only in one place?
"IT'S MARVEL, BABY!!!" the entire fighting game community exclaims in unison.
does DC stand for desperately confused? - a dc fan
Marvel vs capcom continuation
😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😇
some of the costumes look overdesigned as hell but that seems to be the point lol. exciting!
Marvel civil war part 2
Spidey sensu!!
roster already deeper than rivals
But how much
Some executive at Capcom just punched his computer monitor after seeing this. 😬
アイアンマンってガンダムみたいになってんのね
This art style goes crazy!
Long overdue sequel of Marvel Super Heroes
This one’s for JJ 👍
Looks like dragon ball fighterz but even more incredible!!
so.... only 8 characters in the game?
😁
Controlling 4 players at once? I can't even control one character to their full potential in an Arc System Works game... also, Iron Man is a Gundam now?!
MARUBERU TOKON
Ok this makes up mvci
I hope this comes to pc
I didn’t think this I didn’t want this but now that I see it I NEEEEEEEEED IIIIIIIIITT 🤯💥💥💥
KAMALA!!!!!!!!!!! LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’m so happy to be alive right now!
This looks 🔥🔥🔥
Doctor doom looks awesome, hope daredevil is in the game
yet another arc sys fighter. just what i wanted...
What’s “Tokon”? Some series I’ve never heard of?
Personally this is NOT what I had in mind when I said I wanted a Marvel fighting game, but it's sick none the less. Bit of a shame to have Spidey speaking Japanese and not be in the Supaidaman outfit.
So this & 2KXO both in 2026? Iono man we'll see if these tag games can get people off of SF6 & Tekken 8, I really hope so!
KERENNNNN
4v4!? oh dear the final roster must be absolutely nuts here
MvC minus the C. 😆
I like how Storm announces the game title at the end.
Marvel rivals: Guys, this is my baby brother!
This is like the marvel version of injustice 2 / capcom and i love it
Looks amazing.....HORRIBLE NAME! WHO CAME UP WITH IT!?
WE ARE SO BACK! WE HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS BACK IN THE HISTORY OF BEING SO BACK!
I guess Ms.Marvel was mandated from higher ups…. Rest of chars coolio, even with the exagerated costumes…. By the way, that Spider-man is Peter or Ben?  Cause that costume looks a lot more like Ben’s How many more years until the real vs everyone wants though? You know Marvel vs the Distinguished Competence
Watashi wa jigoku kara no shishadesu…SUPAIDAMAN!!
we have doom and ghost rider as a playable character before marvel rivals😂  jokes aside, this looks good, another w for asian devs
Not crazy about Cap and Iron Man’s designs. Everyone else looks good though
Octuple Tag Team. Looks like we're going back Marty. Back to the future.
Marvel vs capcom - capcom +anime
But will it have Ruby Rose?
I’m not a big marvel and don’t play many fighting games but this game looks stunning visually. Will keep my eye on this.
DC need to pack it up. Rip Dc
Meh
Sooo...Marvel FighterZ?
Bro ps5 exclusive really
Looks sick ark sys on fire atm!
An All-New, All-Different MAHVEL BAYBEE!
Que locura
Who are these people? Where are all the Capcom characters?
2v2 to 4v4 huh
El diseño del Cap y de Tormenta están brutales.
no... fckn... way... FINALLYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!
Rudy Reyes, East L.A. Special. Take my money.
Close enough, Welcome back Marvel vs Capcom
thank you edit: im so excited
First they're Rivals now they're Fighting Souls. Marvel's on a gaming streak
Infinite potential, but for real not the failed one.
I know what ill be playing...
take my money !!!!
Marvel Weeb Edition! 😁
the music is fire🔥🔥🔥🔥
Kamala is like the gremling that gets added to all the product releases like jar jar
If this has roll back its over.
Whoever thought of this and made this deal with Arc happen, I would like to thank you!
Arc Systems??? LFG!!!
No hulk or Thor is Crazy work
I can hear Max dood's screams from here.
Dragonball FighterZ walked so this could run.
Ms Marvel Ms Marvel 🗣🗣
Another skin simulator
Mobile please ❤❤❤
Rise of Marvel games .....
Now, I want using this art a good Marvel vs Capcom 5
Why Is it Japanese though?
Lets gooooooo
Meu Deus, que coisa linda 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Dawg whos in charge of all of these😭😭
Doom is gonna be a problem. I can already see it… 😭🔥
Is it confirmed to be an exclusive for PlayStation, hope not.
We got Marvel FighterZ before GTA VI
it would be interesting to see an triple aaa rpg with this art style
DBZ FighterZ but Marvel?
The animation looks choppy and smooth at the same  I love it
Starlord stealing Dante whole flow 😂
Marvel vs Capcom with no Capcom! This looks great!
Tomokazu Sugita Star-Lord is the most perfect dub casting decision.
MCU: Meh MVGU: Its poppin off baby!!!
Next Marvel introducing Capcom
Loving Robbie Reyes Ghost Rider!
Ts fina b cold asf 🔥
Arc system works behind? Already big success!!!!
Is this going to be on mobile
If this is 4v4 the roster must be INSANELY HUGE
Remember we had Marvel Super Heroes so we are still on track for another MVC Marvel gotta flex its Roster a little bit
I was sold the moment they said Arc System Works is behind it.
"FOOT DIVE" ?
dam not even the goated arcsystem works could make mcu look not lame.
Now Imagine arcsys works on the street Fighter Alpha series with their Artstyle 😵‍💫😱....
SOLD!  Holy crap!!  That's why Marvel vs Capcom isn:t around, it's because Marvel said naw, we love you but we are going a different direction.
Marvel FighterZ
Gimme Wolverine!
new money grab game h😂
Looks more like a marvel anime to me
Finally, a true spiritual successor to Marvel vs Capcom  Looks awesome! Hope this turns out great
Storm❤❤❤🎉
"FOOT DIVE !!!"
Why does PlayStation 4 cannot have this game 💀
Bring in android
GIVE ME ULTRON ARC SYS AND MY LIFE WILL BE YOURS
Plssssss need a venom pls
bye bye MvC
Basically dragon ball fighterz,but marvel
_Marvel vs Capcom Infinite has been removed from Evo_  [Marvel will remember that]
Dragon ball fighters but marvel……take my money
Pls do 1 vs 1 mode
Finally, Japanese dubs. First time since Marvel Future Avengers.
IDC, immediate buy
This atleast should have a 30 man roster at minimum..4v4 is nuts 😅
fighterz was ROBBED I SAY. ROOOOOBED
This just looks like a reskinned Street Fighter lame.  At least Storm is hot I guess
I'M PLAYING THIS OVER MARVEL RIVALS, PLS LET THIS GAME BE GOOD
The DLC is INEVITABLE
this is perhaps the best looking art in a fighting game ever
Me likey
Marvel Games are so back
Waaaaaaiiiiit......they cooked.
English…….
looks good, too bad i dont play figthing games
I hope plis i hope a lot of new/old chracters, dont talk about Venom, or Magneto, i talk about a good Skrull, some of Fantastic 4, red richards
People, my friends at work have been discussing this for a while now, I have no words for this epicness of a game, but wouldn't it be amazing if Arc System Works developed a 4v4 fighting game with characters from Fire Emblem? My God...
Marvel doing stuff DC can only wish 😭
MARVEL........GEAR?
PEAK!! Arc Sys Anime Marvel fighting game!! PEAK
Marvle vs capcom sin capcom
the Bestt ❤❤❤
Cool ❤❤❤
LFG!!!
hell yes
dragon ball fighters but better lol
ArcSys making a marvel game is something I would’ve never expected 👀👀
I AM BESIDE MYSELF, IS THIS REAL?? SOMEBODY PINCH ME
Storm looks 🔥
I hope with the new Xbox having steam I will still be able to play this because I have been wanting years for a new mvc game and this is the coolest thing we will ever get
DC’s crying in the corner rn
Me: sees doctor doom on screen and has PTSD flashbacks of my friends spamming Foot Dive over and over again.
Storm looking FINE.
I fell asleep
Insane, its lovely🎉🎉🎉 🎉🎉❤
we have marvel rivals why would be need this garbage
Nah Marvel vs Capcom 3 is way more OP
STOOORRMMMM🤩🤩🤩
We need Moon Knight in this game! The combos would literally be peak!
Hopefully we'll get the full fantastic 4 on this one! and a lot of guardians too, Nova, Quasar, Mantis and Moondragon would be so cool in this game
They took the Capcom out of my Marvel vs Capcom
I wonder if there will be intro dialogue like in Mortal Kombat or in Marvel Rivals
Wheres punisher!?
Foot dive
Finally someone thats going to do the game right and not run to the Justin Wongs and F Champs to mess up the game. BLESS YOU ARC SYSTEMS and Marvel for finally taking that license from capcom.
This game is goona change the way tag team fighting games are made and played! So hyped for this!!
This  is amazing, cant believe Arc System works is beating capcom to the next tag marvel game!    Could not have picked a better team if it wasnt going to be capcom.
A new Marvel fighting game? In ArcSys' art style? Do you WANT to financially ruin me?  Steam version's region locked in my country. Apparently you don't.
All I need is cyclops show me xmen
If doom don't got foot dive then I don't want it
This looks freaking awesome.
I wish arc system works made an atla/korra fighting game instead of this.
huh
Capcom: I THOUGH WE HAD SOMETHING SPECIAL!! *cries*
Anime Kamala Khan feels RIGHT
Take my money
"Oh its marvel? I wonder what-" *arcsys logo appears* "OH MY GOD HOLD UP WIAT WAI WAI-"
Looks amazing!! Can’t wait
悪魔博士好き〜
STORM LOOKS AMAZING 🤩😍
Peak
Storm mommy... Sorry... Mommy... Sorry...
DC who? 😂
Close enough, welcome back Marvel vs Capcom 5.
This is a SONY produced game there totally assisting Arc systems in developing this stop giving everyone but don’t credit for this
Between this and Marvel Rivals us Marvel fans are eating good
Cap's jacket 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I can't wait for this to come out I am not going to buy a PlayStation 5 though I'll go to Rent-A-Center rental PlayStation 5 by The game from GameStop Play it all the way to the last day I got to return it
"Spidey sense"😭😭🔥
4v4 lit
RIP Marvel vs. Capcom. 🥀
What language r they talkin???
GIVE ME MY SHIELD!!! I'M SO EXCITED!!!
Finally.. Marvel is finally going to have their own fighting game. The roster is really good, and I really hope to see Winter Soldier on the DLC!
Wow spider man is so cool and doom
We went from 2v2 to 3v3 to 4v4. As someone who loves Marvel vs. Capcom im very excited for this..
4v4?!?! In a fighting game?!?! I am down!
close enough... Welcome back Marvel vs Capcom 5
Marvel vs Capcom - Capcom = ?
LETS GO!!!! PLZ GIVE ME US AGENT, CYCLOPS, DOCTOR OCTOPUS, SHOCKER OR ELECTRO!!! ALSO VENOM AND PRETTY MUCH ALL SPIDER-MAN VILLAINS! FANTASTIC 4!
It's like Dragon Ball FighterZ but from Marvel
Spidey sense 😂
Anyone else here got to witness Max's live reaction 😂?
You know the game is going to be good when Captain America starts Speaking Japanese
BYE BYE MARVEL VS CAPCOM>
Looks kinda King of fighters
we getting a solid-looking competitor to 2XKO and it's not even out
Spider sense as Attack Shout-out so funny, imagine Daredevil shouting , Hearing Sense
cool.... but if its all in japanese im not even remotely interested
So... it's basically a marvel contest of champions 2?
Capcom who?
You can tell this is made by the same team as Dbfz
Take my money, Plz now, Where’s pre order?
Marvel,Anime,FIGHTERZ STYLE GAME😩😩😩😩🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽
Does this mean marvel vs guilty gear or fighterZ is a possibility?
Marvel games are finally making people forget how aweful their previous titles used to be
If they add Capcom characters as dlc ima throw a fit😤
2XKWho?
Metanle a capcom
as a starlord main on rivals its so cool
Lol at capcom getting backstabbed by marvel, serves them right after infinite
Brooooooo ain't no way arcsys and marvel just dropped a fighting game out the blue 😂
So DBZ fighters w/ marvel skins lol. Looks good tho
japan has all the right to put Sepaidu-man in his mecha! PLEASE just do it already~
I hope we can get Johnny Blaze as a skin for Robbie that changes his animations or attacks
Que no lo cancelen como Black Panther jajajajaja
Marvel Vs. Cap&comp.
un fighter z mehhh
I’m Sorry but I just can’t stand manga marvel
Yes Disney is giving freedom 😂
I hope they give IronMan the Ditko particles.
Fuaaa será marvel vs guilty gear 😅 ?
DOOOM seals the deal for me
Gosh this soudtrack is amazing, pretty much everything is amazing about this so far, designs,music,4v4 and who knows what to expect.
I am excited
hope they add Terry Bogard and Mai in this game
Which characters are being retconned into troons this time, Arc System Works?
Hey DC, as a mega fan of you, you’re getting your asses kicked AGAIN. Step it up.
oh yes , arc system .... the EA of the modern fighting games , 8 starting characters , the rest gonna be DLCs :)  makes me remember crapcom worst years with their dlc crap
Stop trying to make Kamala Khan happen.
The studio that brought us guilty gear i'm down
this better have the fantastic four at launch. beyond hype for this game, thank you for choosing arcsys!
Dragon ball fighterz
marvel fighterZ ?
Foot dive where?
DID DOCTOR DOOM JUST PULL THE BLICKY ON GHOST RIDER?? THIS IS PEAK
👍
Marvel vs Guity gears please!!!!!
I believr a Supaida Protecta skin is in order by how he just shout "Spider Sense" like its an active ability
Hell yeah
Captain America speaking Japanese is crazy
Oh this eatsss🫶🏾
I will buy a PS5 if this is Playstation exclusive i just have to play this
Will this game have english dub?
DAY...ONE...PURCHASE. ZETTAI NI   I wonder if this is a result of Disney blaming Capcom for giving them exactly what they demanded during development for MVCI, and the result being mediocre.
I can't wait for the full roster
Been a fan of arc sys for a long time this makes me really happy to see 🥲
I have to admit it's a little strange to see characters like Storm and Dr. Doom in action after seeing the same movesets for over 20 years. Not bad in any way, it's just strange to see them with a completely new moveset.
To copy a famous quote:  Arc Systems...So you know it's good 👌
wow!!! the marvel fighting game has finally came true!!! WOOooOOooO and its being developed by arc systems works!! WELL played marvel!! i wish it was just a 1v1 fighting game but ill take any solo marvel fighting game at this point!!! the potential is LIMITLESS!! and i know the story mode gonna be crazy!! just in time for doomsday and secret wars
My god. Anime marvel fighting game and it's with arc system works so there's the possibility of crossovers with other arc system works games.
Jusy merge this with rivals and let us fight like that against each other and the other team while we wait for the lobby to fill up....or just give us the skins lol
Dr. Doon better have foot dive or there will be riots
The western brain cannot comprehend this level of character design. Just look at how cool and majestic all their costume designs are, compared to the plain, lame and artless ones in Marvel comics.
WOW. Stupifying. I guess this means that there is no hope for MvsC4? I'd still prefer CAPCOM's take, but...here we go.  OK, Juggernaut, Sentinel, MODOK, and the 4th slot is open!  Show more villains, please.
Finally X-MEN...stupid Disney, please don´t screw it T-T
This giving me Fighterz vibes.
Why can't we have a Kamala this cute in the movie ?
We never had a 4 vs 4 fighting game before  King of Fighters 2001 : Am I a joke to you?
Finally mah boi star-lord is put in a fighting game. I hyped asf for this🎉
fantastic trailer
As an Xbox Player. This breaks my heart 😔. Sony NEVER extends the Olive Branch.
WE ARE NEVER GETTING MVC4!!!!!!
IT'S MAHVEL BAYBEE
Sou bad guy guest character
I hope there is an English version
Finally! I’ve been wanting a solo Marvel fighting game for years. Consider me hyped
Perfect, Fighter Z but with another skin
This is going to be the modern day Marvel vs. Capcom 2.
An ArcSys Marvel game?? Wow I didn't expect this but very excited
The game looks fine, next time just don't steal half of the sop’s time please
No love for xbox☹️
Marvel FighterZ
it's like marvel vs capcom but without capcom.
Ironman with a V-Fin VERRRY GUNPLA :D
omg!!!!!! this is beautiful
oh so that's what arc system works has been doing while neglecting all their other games
New marvel vs Capcom 4
Marvel Z Fighters?
Ms Marvel being included makes everyone excited.  Literally the most popular and best selling Marvel character from the past 50 decades, with near zero cancellations.
I think Marvel is finally realising what kind of audience they have.
Vamos el nuevo guilty y fighter z
Has Doom No Foot Dives 2/10
Air combos ?
It must remain Japanese !❤
Bro a guilty gear MAREVL omg......... When's the pro-order?
Ironman looks like a straight up sentai ranger.
ITS MAHVEL BABYY
STAN LEE IS MAD BRO
Iron man's a gundam now?
finally ghost rider
WILL PRE-ORDER MICROSECOND I CAN I NEED IT LOOKS SO COOL I LOVE IRON MAN'S SUIT FIRST MARVEL RIVALS THEN THIS MARVEL IS COOKING SO HARD!!!!!
These will probably be skins in Marvel Rivals.
What? No shuma gorath?  Ugh...
Chinese(Tencent) Marvel vs Japanese(Arcsys) Marvel...
A new Marvel fighter? You've piqued my interest.
Yeah imma buy this, it looks cool ngl
Capcom better make “all stars vs.” Now
Oh no... it's published by Sony... Please no region-lock. PLEASE NO REGION LOCK.
Why does Ghost Rider look like a teenager in a tracksuit?
I can't get over the fact that Spidey speaks engrish
Whats this
So a quad finish is gonna be called a happy new year, right?
Yaya Robbie Reyes getting some attention!
If this game has Rocket it is day 1 buy for me
Not coming to switch 2 is a crime to your sales marvel
Sepaydarman 😂
I mean.. this looks cool, but I'm never going to play it. I might watch an animation showcase on youtube or something but even if I was into fighting games I don't think I'd touch it - it's obviously going to be lacking in variety compared to other fighter games and there's only so much marvel I want to consume.
Hyped for this and Marvel's Cosmic Invasion game coming out! It's going to be a great 2 years for Marvel fans as far as video games go.   I really hope we get some characters we haven't seen in fighting games thus far! I really want to see Nightcrawler, Daredevil, The Thing, Blade, and Man-Thing in this game! Bullseye, Kingpin, Batroc, Impossible Man, Gladiator and Blue Marvel making the cut would make this my favorite game of all time, but that's just wishful thinking!
sugoi
Star-Lord has never been cooler.
Sold!
Lets hope marvel doesnt make ghost rider the lowest damage fighter this time
I’m a Spider-Man main day 1
Never thought I’d seeing Tony wearing a Gundam inspired suit.
Why does PlayStation get all the good stuff 😭
ngl I dont play fighting games but this looks really cool!
Ah man sucks it isn’t on the ps4 as well, I’d love to main ms marvel ( I know, I know I’m poor because I’m playing on an old console)
Wow.
Invite Ryu as a guess characters
So instead of Marvel Vs Capcom 4. . .we got this. .   Unpleasing.
That was awesome! and japanese voices made it cooler!
Needs English dub😂
Marvel - Capcom
MARVEL x ArcSys = I can do this all day!
Does arc system works make every fighting game not tekken and sf
no jodan porque lo hacen con estilo anime, quieren ser otro juego de peleas anime del monton o q? un estilo comic le hubiera dado mas esencia
Oh my lord this is beautiful
This feels like the marvel rivals to 2xko. They be taking on all genres.
"I'm not interested." >ArcSys "I've never needed something more in my life."
Okay, everybody be reeeeeeal quiet.... And don't tell JWong.
FighterZ 2 hopefuls are currently on suicide watch
Anyone else notice fogwells gym, it's definitely a reference to daredevil
So no news on anything about dbfz
Marvel rivals collab in the future
Babe Wake Up Another Peak Storm Design Dropped
oh wow who knew  that  the way to make tag fighters more interesting is by giving more fighters slots on the team  rather than reducing them   the superior data driven minds in 2xko are in shambles rn
“Announcement trailer” ***
1:54 the closest thing my boi get his FOOT DIVE in this game 😆🤟
The muscle memory when playing established characters in the Capcom games is gonna be wild.
Capcom seething right now
🔥
Tokkon….
This is dope 0:11
Marvel Super Heroes... Awesome!
Marvel to Capcom: We should see other people
Doom out here aura farming with every move
😮
If Sakura Spider isn't in the game I don't want anything, they literally have the chance
HYPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm sorry, 4V4?!?
My hero academia possible crossover
Man WHAT??? This looks amazing and 4 v 4?? I didn’t think we’d ever get to this point. I always thought 3v3 was the limit lol. I can’t wait for this!
Arc Sys got tired of waiting on Capcom too.
We got Marvel FighterZ let's go
Kinda weird that Capcom is not involved. Who's that new character with red trenchcoat and face mask? Is it an original chracter for the game?
No Xbox 😢
So is captain america.. american or japanese lol
Is that... Fake Red??? I also love that they went with Robbie
I don’t even like fighting games but those animations look sick.
It seems like they really learned their lesson by the lackluster performance of MCU games with synergy and realism
So no Marvel vs Capcom 4?
Hmmmmm. Yes. I like this. I like this a lot.
We have Injustice at home.
This game looks incredible. Hope to see a lot of Xmen characters in here, and would also love to see Carnage be in it. He'd be so sick in this.
Dear Marvel,  I officially forgive you for Marvel vs Capcom Infinite.
Ghost Rider in full black using a freaking kasurigama that is on fire ??? I'M SOLDDDD
This looks SICK! 🤩 I can't wait to see my boy Wolverine, and imagine if they put Nightcrawler in there! 🤯 Storm looks AMAZING too! 👌🏾
Marvel Tekken i mean Tokon
Why announce so early
Please, PLEASE have Cyclops
0:48 Spider-Punch! Spider-Kick! Spider... Kiss?
Ghost Rider should be a bozosuku
I'm glad to see Storm.
Dr. Doom better have something resembling FOOT DIVE!
I love this, DC is slacking, Marvel is goated for this collab with Arc System works
Cool
Just take my money
Sticky fingaaaarrrrsss!!
I was gonna say Marvel: Cross-Tag-Battle... But when even more characters showed up all at once, 4v4, I nearly spat out my drink because my expectations were positively exceeded
Wow!! Looks great!!🔥🔥
MARVEL MINUS CAPCOM
No way I'm watching Marvel Guilty Gear rn
Oh…. This looks sick
So this is where the HunterxHunter game budget went
This is making me Hype
I hope to god there's a ranked mode on release
I think Marvel finally realized Japanese and Chinese artists are too GOATED.
Wow this is real 😮
The Wheel of Fortune is Turning.....for Marvel
Maximillian Dood is going to hyper ventilate
What did the spiderman do to get beat up like that man
This was incredible
Switch 2 please
My brain exploded from the sensory overload.  Wow just wow, 2026 can't come quick enough.
Galacta
Yes
sickkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Hear me out! Marvel but make it anime as F!
-Inspired by Marvel vs Capcom -Arc System Works behind the wheel -4 VS 4 GAMEPLAY   This game is going to be legendary
Doom and his awesome walk. xD
Sooooooo. No marvel vs capcom? 😢
As a dc die hard I do love a team marvel fighting game that isn’t bad. I’d love another mvc but this could work.
Finally 2XK.... erm... 4XKO??
Some attack are copy from Marvel Vs Capcom hut still looks amazing.
Wow after Marvel Vs Capcom Infinite, Marvel really said “Alright who else could make an insane fighting game? Bingo! Arc System Works.” LOL
This looks great but my adhd is not keeping up with all of this
Nani!?!???
why so much garbage japanese art style games lately? Can we go back to some good character designs?
3 cosas  1. Si es Playstation Studios ¿significa que sera exclusivo de PS?  2. ¿Que pasara con Marvel vs Capcom?  3. ¿Que busca Arc System con este juego? Son mas de adaptaciones de anime o juegos mas anime que esto  Muy disgustado 😡
I am ready for marvel minus Capcom. Hopefully I can play with a friend instead of waiting for 2xko
Another Mahvel has hit the fgc.  This looks amazing.
Marvel Super Heroes 2
irei compra-lo e me deleitar com a temp... digo, gameplay
I will NOT be playing this sub lol.
MAHHVEL BABY (Is this how you do it?)
Did Capcom not want to play?
I don't see my rocket raccoon
While the Marvel movies have been floundering, the video games have been thriving!
add my king moonknight please thanks
MARVEL HAS BEEN COOKING IN THE GAME DEPARTMENT
Did Maximillian Dood wish this into existence? He may have
Bro js make a X-men game🥀💔
Now this is GAMING
Ark vs Marvel to 2030?
Where Jeff
The kind of game DC only able to dream of 😂
This is absolutelly dope, but I would give everything to have a Chun-li, Juri, Morrigan and Strider DLC team
4 character on a team? Well ain't that Fantastic FN!
This looks amazing!!!!!
I want whichever Character Designer made Iron Man’s helmet look like the Gundam to know that they are seen, and they are respected.
Marvel meets guilt gear.
best part of the trailer is the unrelenting onslaught to that ms. marvel chic. Nobody wants her and even the devs know lol
I already know Leland 🤤
Excelente todo incluso con la voz japonesa que le da el alma a esta clase de juegos
so no switch2 port?
Omg I've wanted this sorta thing for so long
oh well rip marvel vs capcom hello marvel vs marvel
Crazy max just said something about 4 player marvel. No way my boy star lord finally made it into a 2d fighter 👏🏾
marvel is rising
that ain’t starlord that space commoner
It looks like 2XKO with a Marvel skin.
STREET FIGHTER - MARVEL STYLE? CHAAAAA!!!!
When I saw it I could only think of Arc system doing it, it's the same style as GG and GB, but it's good, I'm not complaining 😊
WOOOOOWWWW <3
Oh wow , a remake of the old Marvel Super Heroes fighting game from the 90s
I know Wolverine will be in because you can't have Marvel without everyone's favorite clawed Canadian. I hope Capcom makes a better MvC4 than the trash called MvC: Infinite.
All my favorite functions are here!
Doom with da Mauser C96
God is REAL!!
C'mon Daisuke, you're up again
Soo Iron man Gundam ?
Hehe. Seems like when factoon of marvel is dipping, another rises. Comics failing? Lets do Movies! Movies failing? Lets do video games!
Already calling it star lord , ghost rider , storm
First guilty gear, then blaz blue, then DBZ, NOW MARVEL!!!!! SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!!
Capcom's sales team really dropped the ball on this one
I don't believe in video game companies, I lost faith a long time ago, but for some reason I knew the game would look great from the moment the Arc System Works logo appeared.
No black panther???
RDC?
HYPE HYPE HYPEEEEEE
My oh my!!
Behold Marvel FighterZ
Nice👌
Cool, but this is nothing new.
Looks bonkers. Going with ARC systems, the developer of MVC:infinite’s  rival is a hilarious turn of events.
Nice, too bad it's not on a console I own.
Marvel fans are eating good with the games this time
THIS LOOKS SO AMAZING
Xbox?
four v four means the roster is gonna be very large
Boo platform discrimination still in 2026 -_-
really hype and the one thing im thinking, its an Arksys fighter with Marvel characters.. is this still considered an anime fighter?
Amazing but doom didn't do a footdive that is my only complaint
So if you're tired of Marvel Rivals, this is the game for you
Hulk,Thor, Venom, Deadpool,& Wolverine should be added to the roster.
these marvel games have been hitting the nail on the head...
What a time to be a Marvel Fan.
Cool
1:53 My Spidey 😭😭
Dragon ball fighterz vibes but LETS FFFING GOOO
the moment i saw Arc System Works, "Yep! This is gonna be good!!"
ITS MARVEL BABY 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
it looks like db fighterz copy paste same style
Hey Sony, dont you dare lock this behind a PS account.
FighterZ versión Marvel
Yall are cooking fr
Jaw-dropping! This looks amazing.
When will DC do something like this?! 😭😭😭 As a DC fan I’m very hungry for good games about my favourite heroes. First Marvel Rivals, now this? (I like Marvel Rivals, no hate at all)
Anyone else a fan of the new character designs?
Desperdicie una hora de mi vida para esta mmda
Ikeh ikeh ikeh
Close enough Welcome back dbfz ❤️‍🩹
This the greatest thing I have ever seen 😢
Captain america is my second favorite anime.  My first favorite is spongebob.
I knew upon seeing the first few seconds it was an arc sys game and will be a banger
Wow
ITS MAHVEL BAYBEE
We gonna have a ginormous roster.
this is an awkward way to find out Playstation was still around.  Why wouldn't you just play on an entire computer instead of a little piece of one ?  It's like buying half a dog as a pet.
Amazing 😮
The best thing is that it's not for Xbox 😂
Nah Iron Man looking like a Gundam out here 🤤
Marvel Minus Capcom
DESTRUCTIVE FINISH!
This is sick, now release it on the f****** Switch 2 dammit!
PLUUUSSS ULTRRRAAAAA!!!
Marvel vs marvel fate of 1 world 🤣
Maining ghost rider off jump
Lord give me Moon Girl and Devil Dino as a puppet character please
Marvel Figther Z
4 v 4 Someone was bound to try it eventually
Nice
Arc systems you cheating whr this isn't fighterz 2 lol
This is the roster? 2 women?
Marvel games being developed by asian game studios is the right way to go. First Netease with Rivals now this with ArcSys
“World’s most expensive Gundam model” indeed.
Injustice is better
Imaging this in the DBZ BT 2 style
And R. I. P xbox once again :/... I rlly f ing know what console I Will buy next.. This is actually ridicilous
If I’ve learned one thing it’s that arcsys don’t miss
This comment will let you if it flopped in the future
2XKO is cooked.... THANK YOU MARVEL!
Mirip Dragonball Z Fighter 😁
Looks awesome, sadly fighting games aren’t my thing so I’ll pass but it still looks great
Marvel vs Capcom, mas sem a Capcom
Take my money!!!!!
Supidah-man confirmed lol
this looks absolutely sick
How hard can it be to revive marvel heroes omega to console and pc agian but no we get this trash same goes for marvel rivals and marvel avengers.
I hope wolverine gets added along with hulk and Deadpool
Marvel meets Dragon Ball FighterZ. Now that's a big W.
Nice from what I’m seeing so far. Love it already. Could also become a door opener for a future MVC title.
This abt to be heat
I think Iron-Man became Gundam-Man
IT'S MAHVEL BABY
Thanks you Marvel game Marvel thanks you
They have someone with brain on marvel?cause we got Captain America and Black panther, insomniac wolverine, the blade game, MARVEL rivals and now this
Foot Dive or i ain't playin'
They copied Dante's special from MvC3  for Star Lord.....
É pedir muito pra um Marvel vs Capcom 4???
WHY... Why always cameos, why can't we have true 1 v 1 ? Multiversus, Mortal Kombat 1, Project L, and now this game, stop with cameos, or make it optional...
I'm gettin that!
The roster has to be huge if its 4v4.
Hope it comes to the Switch 2.
please for the love of god don't add auto-combos to this game cause it actually looks good and ruining it like that would be a waste. I'll even take modern and classic controls the same way SF6 has it over KOF15 auto-combos cause jesus christ it made the game so repetitive and boring to play.
Not really a Marvel fan, but this visually looks amazing and a lot of fun to play.
Not on Xbox 💔
ありがとうMARVEL、ありがとうPlayStation、ありがとうARC ここ最近のMARVELGAMESは本当にファンの欲しいものがわかっている…所々シネマティックユニバースの声優を使っているのも嬉しいポイント過ぎる。
I'll have the Marvel vs Capcom please; hold the Capcom.
Im praying Yuri gets to voice spiderman if there's a english dub
*AWW MANNN ONLY 8 CHARACTERS? 😥 WE NEED AT LEAST 92 MORE 😠*
DOCTOR DOOM AND HIS PISTOL
MvM ?
Marvel to capcom: "Thank you, next."
This looks sick!!! a street fighter style game that’s just marvel characters!!! I love how iron man looks like a power ranger
is no one gonna talk about how iron man is literally a gundam?? I love it
They spoiled doomsday ! 🎙️
GGST 3V3 walk so MARVEL TOKON could run
Cool trailer. Unfortunately, 170 countries probably still won't be able to purchase this game because Sony hates money or something.
4 VS 4!!!???? EXCUSE ME?
Yessssss
Let me get that playable MODOK
Really wish they would stop trying to make Kamala Khan a thing. She ruins everything she touches. Otherwise, looks great.
Where is The Wolverine!?😮 This game is goin to be the definition of hype
Just add Deadpool, Wolverine, Cyclops, Psylocke and Cable....im sold.
This is what’s on my birthday list
this looks heat
THEY FINALLY GAVE STARLORD HIS ELEMENT GUNS
WE NEED MORE X-MEN
That way my mouth is hanging open right now
Yall gotta have deadpool be an unlockable character
Magneto looks great 👍
The only way I could would be more hyped would be if they added Venom and Deadpool (pls do it arc)
Marvel FighterZ
DUUUUDE ARC SYSTEM HELL YEAHH!!
THIS GOT LEAKED YEARS AGO AND ITS FINALLY HERE RAHDGHFU BDJDJCMTNDDIXJHD YES
I’m so glad to see Ms. Marvel back!  Also Doctor Doom be aura farming.
I can see it now:  2 characters eliminated at once: Happy Birthday!  3 characters eliminated at once: Merry Christmas!!  4 characters eliminated at once: Happy New Year!!!
Es como si marvel VS capcom pero sin Capcom, no esperaba tanto 😭😭😭 GRACIAS POR TODO MARVEL GAMES 🥵🥵🥵
This.. huhuhu does put a smile on my face
I knew James gunn was gonna ruin things
OOOOOOOOH THEY GOT ME GEEKIN WITH THIS ONE
IIIIIIITS MAHVEL BABY
TAKE MY MONEY
This revealed was insane!
4xKO
GET EFFING REKT CAPCOM
A Marvel Game I'm actually interested in?? 2xko who???
No way they cookin like this 😭🔥
A game like this can’t be that expensive to make, but watch them drop an $80 price tag.
I'm never playing injustice once this drops
Ms. Marvel, Astagfirullah ukhti🤦🏻‍♂️
Classic is the best!!! Wohoooooo
I was here?
So MarvelBallFighterZ? Lol
I appreciate that marvel has seemed to learn their lesson about announcing games way too early, besides marvel rivals when was the last time a marvel game got announced with a release date
Didn't hear Dr Doom say foot dive at least 18 times.....Oh well I'll cope😂😂.
I'm still salty for a Capcom Marvel again lol
Marvel vs Capcom and Marvel rivals 2.0
Marvel's fantastic four video games in summer 2029
Mahvel without Capcom, and the fingerprints of meddling Disney execs are all over it. Hard pass. I hope Disney goes bankrupt in my lifetime so maybe someone who actually cares about Marvel can snatch up their IP and we can have at least one more good Mahvel before I die.
We should get all these default skins as free alternate looks in Rivals.
Please have Squirrel Girl
YOU'VE just earned a sub!!!! HLY WOW!!!
Looks absolutely fantastic!!  please dont ruin it immediately by doing live service elements /battle passes / costumes for 69$ xoxo
Oh I was oh they changing teams after doom showed up and was oh ok they switching teams to show off characters and then they showed the 4v4   I think this is the first fighting game that is a 4v4 and with a larger studio
Storm is mommy
Marvel's fantastic four video games developed by insomniac games
Pls be the New Marvel vs Capcom 3 pls be the New Marvel vs Capcom 3 pls be the New Marvel vs Capcom 3
I’m so happy I could cry
Please have ultron
Bro why is this in Japanese 🤡
Marvel is doing so great right now. In the video game spaces
Sitting here trying to figure out if I would favor English voices or Japanese.  It's so anime I'm really not certain.
Iron gundam🎉😊
Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales  2 video games in Fall 2027
No foot dive?
WHY IS THIS COMING OUT WHEN I'M GONNA BE IN THE MILITARY AUGHHHHH SAVE ME
Just found my main!!!! STORM MY QUEEN!!!!
Dude... 2xko didnt even release and its already dead!
Captain Gojo
Wow🔥❤️
goooooooooood
Marvel Kombat
Badass. This trajectory of Marvel is Stupendous.
Storm and Doom already lookin broken and OP 😂 I’m here for it tho
So were getting Marvel vs Guilty Gear in the future?
The east is gonna get back all the money DISNEY has been fumbling.
Marvel anime fighter and im hyped
1:55 FOOTDIVE
Give me Legion in this game and my life is yours, Marvel
This is gonna kill 2xko on arrival Rip rito
I hope Dr. Doom got his Foot Dive move as an easter egg or something
marvel vs capcom 4 ?
Weve waited so long for this. I just really hope they go crazy with the roster. There is alot i wanna see. I miss X-Men: Next Dimension so much (and Rise Of The Imperfects)
Woah. I wish my cousin Alex could be here still to see this. Love you Chino! 👼
Does this mean marvel vs capcom is dead
Finally! Marvel Super Heroes 2!
I’m already hyped for this game.
I guess we won't be getting an Injustice style Marvel game😢
Arc System Works GOAT
Finally Marvel FighterZ  ( Both games Made By same Studio!)
Yep, time to make my brothers mad, Eric, Derric, and Will.....don't get this game....im telling you rn
Where is Dante
Marvel is American comic, why it became Japanese? Its called Manga not comic, American really lost its identity for money
gross
Ms. Marvel main fosho!! They always make her OP in any game she's in to get people to play her ❤
Is it gonna be like Guilty Gear? Or Blazblue? Or FighterZ?  Anyway,  I'm excited for this game.
Wish people would stop putting ms marvel in everything no one likes her
"SPIDEY SENSE"
Please no auto combos PLEASE 🙏🏻
Marvel gaming has been on raise lately
Well... 2XKO already dead.
😮
Este tipo mucha mas vibra a marvel vs capcom que el ultimo marvel vs capcom.
Yeah but do you have maybe Wolverine? Thor? Hulk? some heavy hitters?
*Marvel VS CAPCOM* ❌ *Marvel VS MARVEL* ✅
One of the sickest game trailers ive seen in a while, make it epic!!!
Pretty sure Star Lord just did Dante’s Hyper Move.
Needs more foot dives
Omg injustice but with marvel yay
Just like League of Legends with 2XKO
We got a 4 v 4 marvel game not made by capcom b4 gta 6.... What is this timeline
4v4 and only Marvel characters?  This roster is going to be INSANE.
What are we, some kinda Marvel Rivals?
Tgis is just dbfz but with marvel charcters and not dragon ball like ots exactly same the blasts look like ki blasts and kamehameha
Este juego es mucho mas parecido a lo que los fans espeeaban de marvel infinitive
A marvel fighting game by arc system Works?! Count me in!
Now I'm waiting for Nightcrawler to be announced
After Marvel Rivals, We got Marvel Tokon🙏
Yo....
The anime tone kills all hype. 🙄
SUPAIDA-MAN
This might be FighterZ's predecessor.
The game devs are cooking unlike the movie studio.
Marvel has been releasing game after game each year and surprisingly they're actually great! And yet DC/WB is no where to be seen! Which really breaks my heart as a DC fan. :(
finally marvel fighting game but I wanted to be western fighting game not asian
Evo 2026 Game revelation
Great looking game
Why are videos games allergic to comic accurate Spiderman suit
this looks like a fighterz reskin
It’s about time we had a game like this I honestly have high hopes.
Injustice Marvel version
Friendship ended with Capcom, now  Arcsys is my best friend.
FGC: "Yo when's Marvel?" ArcSys: "Fine, I'll do it myself."
so fighterz 2.0
Is it also a ftp game
Marvel is on a generational run
No one seems to be acknowledging that it’s a PlayStation studios title so it’s exclusive to PlayStation and pc
Honestly, this is better than MvC4
Instant Hit
After MvC Infinite, I hope Tokon includes… More X-Men characters like Deadpool, Wolverine, Psylocke, and Magneto. More female fighters like Scarlet Witch, She-Hulk, and Wasp. The Fantastic Four. Miles Morales and for a joke character, Spider-Ham. More villains like Carnage, Taskmaster, Sandman, Super Skrull, and Galactus. Make use of the Infinity Stones.
Omg yes
Capcom has left the chat
I was hoping for a MvC announcement, but you can't argue with an ArcSys game.  DBFZ was unbelievably good, so this is welcome
Koichi Yamadera as Star Lord is by far the best VA-character combo
Can’t wait for the full roster
Looks good. Will there be physical copies?
I guess im buying a PS5 mow
Cool but where is the Wolverine game? You know, the reason I upgraded?
Okay! Yeah! Alright!
Can you imagine Wolverine in this game?
Marvel and DB Fighterz had a baby?!
They turned Iron Man into a freaking *Gundam.*
I appreciate how the male characters are masculine and the female characters are feminine. The frumpy, amoebous characters designed for modern audiences are revolting.
I hate the music but it looks good.
BEAUTIFUL GAME!!!
Why can't this be multiplatform?
KAMALA LOOKS SO GOOD! I'm so glad they didn't MCU her and she kept her stretchy powers. The world is healing
is it just me or do i get DBFighterz vibes lol " shut up and take my money "
Well we did want a Marvel 4...
This just in DC games has been found dead. We have reports it was in fact a Suicide....
Comboing all four characters thats what i call a happy new year
Finally Ghost rider Robbie Reyes!...💀🔥
Man... a 2D fighter.... 😮‍💨
4v4, that's fantastic
This is perfection. I just hope the character roster is big enough. This and Marvel rivals, DC might be cooked for good.
Beautiful
They can literally start pre-orders today 😂
I fell sad for capcom
Praying this has Daredevil, Hulk, and Miles in this.
1:26 ghost rider will know the power of the Glock 19
friendship ended with capcom now arc system works is my bff
Looks like Injustice 3 has competition.
This is not "We have MvC at home", this is such a cool different take on the same thing, that we are actually going to burger king now
Hopefully we get iceman
arcsys??? whelp, gone head and wrap it up capcom. ur finished 😂
I will crash out if Deadpool doesn’t come out in this game pls pls 🙏
I only the new movies where as good as this game it would be awesome!
BEAUTIFUL ❤ LOVE THE STYLE ❤
4v4? I gotta say, it’s fantastic.
still trying to make Kamala a thing, so amusing
marvel strive?!?!?!
Looks good!
Is this a MvC 5 proof of concept?
yuk
As sad as it makes me that Marvek vs Capcom is likely not happening, Arcsytem making a marvel game is the best thing i could dream of.
I hope Emma Frost, Psylocke & Magik are in this game
MY goat gojo is voicing Captain america!!!
That iron man is a Gundam exia ripoff
the madlads actually did it, they made kamala khan cute
This game was already bought when I heard the japanese voices.
Hello potential marvel 4
ArcSys implented the wall break from GGST. hmm...
I felt feelings I didn’t know I had about a marvel fighting game
I saw that golden light hopping from one character to the next like in FighterZ. I like what i see so far, but i really don't want them to do that thing in FighterZ where we'll get different versions of the same character in each season pass (which would be an easy thing to do, considering this is a comic book fighting game)
Is May Guilty Gear Vs. Tokon Ms. Marvel the new hot rivalry?
I would actually really love to see Namor in this since he actually prefers brawling over weapons. 🥺🙏 please I need my wet king
So what is this thing?  King of Marvel?  Street Marvel?  Whatever, I'm so down for this
FIGHTERZ 2 BEFORE FIGHTERZ 2!!
This really surprised me. Came out of nowhere and looks far better than 2XKO which was on my radar before!
This is cool!!!!
A Marvel Japanese fighting game. Like I said Marvel games just keeps getting better and better.
I mean it's still Marvel y'know?
Injustice fans are crying rn (im one of them)
This and Injustice 3 gonna be insane
Finally, after marvel rivals players dropped to 100k (from 600k) now they move on to another Marvel's fighting games again
Capcom has missed the opportunity of making their own CvC game...
I can't wait for the sequel with 17 vs 17 combat!
I think capcom about to sue someone
no foot dive? 👉👈
JIGOKU NO SHISHA SUPAIDAHMAN
IT'S OVER FOR MARVEL CONTEST OF CHAMPIONS😮
Switch2 ficou de fora? Gostam de perder dinheiro ein???
Robbie Reyes 💀 🔥 ⛓️ let's gooooo
Y'all already blew it by giving the game to arcsys. It looks so static.
Ghost rider looks sick asf
0:45 アルティメットスパイダーマン！？
I hope this works on steam deck would be so fire to play on graveyard shift
Marvel FighterZ?
Why Marvel Arc System Works... Why.... Now i know the latest Arc System Works won't interest me for like 7 years of something...
I still want marvel ultimate alliance 4
Spiderman, Wolverine, now...... Exclusive 😒
Marvel, relax. You're leaving DC in the dust 😭
THIS GAME WILL FEED FAMILIESSSSS
Ofc they put Spider-Man getting pieced up
IT'S MAHVEL BABY!
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeee
HOLY WHAT THE OH MY GOD AHHH
while I'm sad to see this isn't capcom, I am VERY interested in seeing what new takes arc system works has for the marvel cast
MAHVEL IS BACK BABY ( Capcom don't cry please, we love you )
No Captain Marvel, no party.
Marvel minus Capcom
Hope they have decent English dubs
If it's locked to any system it's trash!! And I will pass !!
HELL YES! The art style was TERRIBLE for MVC: Infinite. Glad these guys made it look more like an anime. 👌
The creator of MHA apparently designed the characters
I'm so, so happy.
Finally a Storm with no mohawk
0:57-1:02 Dante's level 1?
4 vs 4 is insane character management..
Absolute peak ✋😎🤚
Im just glad that Robbie Ghost Rider is getting the spotlight as well not just Blaze
Xbox is not getting it. Sucks. It's time I upgrade to PC. Gonna spend $5K. I loved Vanilla & Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3.
I can’t believe they gave Doom a blickey
I wouldn't mind if some of these skins came to Marvel Rivals
I think I found my replacement for Tekken 8.
1:23 Doctor doom uses his ultimate attack:gun
Why Marvel insist with Ms Marvel?
Not a fan of anime looking Marvel characters, but it's Arc System Works! So it's a go!!
Finally arc system. The only thing I dislike is Asian style and voices. And I hope to see a much bigger roster maybesome not so popular characters like knull and codex etc...
Ms. Marvel is animated SO WELL. I’m stoked to finally be able to play as her in a fighting game! My dream team will be Spider-Man, Ms. Marvel, Daredevil and maybe Dazzler (if they’re in the game)!
I’m about to be playing doom and ghost rider every game
OH THIS IS HEAT!!
This is such a thing of beauty.
Hopefully we get this in English and as a arcade game in the future
Thanks to Sony and PlayStation to make this possible 🎉
“When’s marvel?”
Gee man why don't any of these marvel games ever add carnage MAN?!?!?
We're gonna get a happy new year with this one!
Still no wolverine smh
c"mon capcom, join the party
2XKO devs are shittin their pants right now
Doom mains trying to ego farm and aura farm is gonna be peak in this game
ARE YOU READY TRUE BELIEVERS? ARC SYSTEM WORKS AND MARVEL ARE TEAMING UP TO BRING YOU..  JAPANESE MARVEL SUPER HEROES!!  LOOK!! SPECTACULAR ACTION! DON’T MISS OUT ON THE ENJOYMENT OF A LIFETIME  FEEL!! SENSATIONAL THRILLS!! DON’T MISS THE MOST AMAZING TAG TEAM FIGHTING GAME EVER  ARE YOU READY FOR A NEW CHALLENGER? NOW COME JOIN  JAPANESE MARVEL SUPER HEROES!!!
Someone let Max Dood know 🚨
Should of been Marvel vs CapCom.
Marvel is just dog walking DC in the games department.
The VA's are absolutely stocked
ITS MAHVEL BABYY
It looks like sf but have some similarities with injustice..... Nice i like it👍
DC: it was supposed to be me😭
Hope they add Cyclops
グッバイカプコン！
Getting just for storm ;cries;
It'd be better if it was in the style of ninja storm instead of street fighter
Some of the art is really weird...
Crazy how just having energetic Japanese voices already makes it more interesting than MVCI.
Yo quería un marvel Vs capcom 5 😢
Checkpoint 🗿... 💀
Marvel games up rn
Marvel VS Capcom without Capcom!!!
Mah boi Robbie Reyes and my lady Storm are here! I'm already eating deliciously!
Fant4stic needs to be in the game
Not impressed
Can we all just take a moment and give praise to the real HEROS.... Arc System Works!!!! You people rock!
We got a winner
No Xbox Series X/S or Switch 2? Disappointing
So you CAN do good things do the same with the Marvel movies and series, bring back Moon Knight too.
A lot of these moves are from MVC
I didn’t know Spider-Man was Japanese
well this means marvel vs capcom is so death
marvel x arcsys? im so hard right now!
This about to break the internet. Capcom were waiting on your response bc Arc System bout to lay all fighters to rest with this one 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm sold
Ahhh 2xko, what will u do now
Looks like MVCI Beyond became a real game
Was looking forward to this. But since this is Playstation published game 180 countries (mine included ) will be banned from playing this...
When does this come for Steam Deck?
Yo!!!! Arc System Works had their parts in this?
A fighting game?
THIS IS INCREDIBLE
Straight up Street Fighter Game fr...
I like how Iron Man looks like a gundam.
even iron man decided to dress up like a japanese superhero lol
Marvel is single handedly saving video games rn, I love it.
Where is the cheaper town hall?
Storm's a Gyaru
Which Multiverse Timeline is this?
Happy and sad at the same time.
I need that music pumped into my veins
No black panther?
Immediately thought Star Lord moves a lot like Dante, they seem really influence by MvC3 from my initial impression
Im only getting it if they add Scott or Jean eventually
THE PUNISHER AND VENOM BETTER BE IN THIS GAME
A triple A X-men game would be great
The English Language voice actors for this upcoming Marvel Video Game    Josh Keaton: Spider-Man  Eric Loomis: Iron Man  Brian Bloom: Captain America  Steve Blum: The Hulk Rick D. Wasserman: Thor
4v4?!?  we need a term that goes higher than Merry Christmas now?!?
Can't wait to see my boy Morbius and Madame Web in it.   But seriously, this is awesome as hell.
my mind is blown!!
This reveal trailer had a larger roster than Project L does in their current version
I hope they add English dub later cause i dont do English sub
Q Coisa feia 😂
Only 8?
se viene un nuevo marvel vs capcom
ITS GIVING DB FIGHTERZ VIBESSSSSSSS AND IM HERE FOR ITT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Arcs if you add silk to this game my life is yours!
Arcs if you add silk to this game my life is yours!
Somewhere in SNK, former creative team members of KOF's NEST Saga got a slight tingle for no discernable reason
Take my f****** money!!!! So it's dragon Ball fighterz but marvel yes a million times yes
No micro-transactions please
YOOO
No Xbox clowns?
Please ArcSys you can do it
I T ' S   M A H V E L   B A B Y ! ! !
English come out later?
Aaaaaa queria já prá 2025😢😢😢
As excited as I am for this.... all fighting games feel like a giant cash grab with DLC. Guess I need to wait several years for the "Deluxe" pack once this is unsupported. Too bad really. It has completely turned me off of the entire genre.
You had me at Storm 😅💯💯💯
They forgot the Capcom part
i thought they forgot about ghost rider
This is just marvel rivals
*Marvel: The Chunin Exams*
DC gotta catch up
Shout out to Kamala on making the starting roster. She's a great pull.
Japan joining in with china on making a game using an american ip, though I think they should've made a dc game(Preferable something not batman related)
inshallah this shall flop massively and we'll get MvC4 after
If catching 3 characters is a happy birthday what's catching 4 characters?
YEAAAAAAHHHHHH!  I BEEN WAIT AGES FOR A NEW MARVEL FIGHTING GAME AND ITS MARVEL ITSELF!
Marvel Street Fighter.
Why this trailer gave me the weird feeling they are going to use the "linked soul" history thing from fighterz?
Actually something good from marvel? Thank you this cuz this looks SO COOL
I was not expecting this but I’m genuinely excited.
Hear me out. Add some Disney DLC characters since Disney owns everything! Imagine Hulk vs Wreck It Ralph , Spiderman vs Peterpan , Storm vs Malefacent, Iron Man vs Baymax
ARC SYSTEMS YEAHHHH
This will be a 0/10 if foot five doesn’t come back
WE WON OG BABY WE WON 4v4!?
Masterpiece!!! ❤
Now we just need Arc system to bring back MAHVEL and we’ll have the perfect video game
ARC SYSTEM WORKS LETS FCKIN GOOOOOO
Marvel minus Capcom fighting souls! Capcom needs to respond hard! Team up with snk or netherrealm or just straight capcom characters! Lets go! Good things are coming I know it!
Wow. Marvel calling on Arc System, that's something I didnt know I'd see. This actually looks very entertaining.
Soon we're gonna have Marvel Vs ArcSysWorks Also, Squirrel Girl vs Makoto
This looks pretty awesome!
Since when does dr doom pack heat?
Marvel Guilty Gear!? I love it
im here because i saw ghost rider
Conventions should have tournaments of this for old times sake
Special guest characters: "Capcom character" 😁
It better be more than just MCU and popular heroes
WHAT
Marvel: "We were really embarrassed by how MVCI turned out so we want our own FighterZ."
So marvel fighterZ?
where is capcom
The spiritual continuation of Marvel Super Heroes
Man we were talking about rivals' characters being over designed lucky me i like over designed characters
OF COURSE ITS NOT ON XBOX DAWG
What I didn't realize at first is that it's made by the same developers who made Dragon Ball FighterZ, which is like one of the best stylish, epic, and kinda easy-to-play fighting game out there 🥳🥳
Why are they using Japanese voices??
Robbie❤
Finally Arc System will have the recognition they deserves 😊
Where dc games what going on over there?
Perfeito
How long till a Goku mod comes out for this
????? 0:47 "spider sense" is NOT a name of an attack that Spider-man should EVER call out, it's the name of a natural sensing ability he has.
Gundam X Iron man. why am I not surprised 😂
The design for Cap goes so freaking hard with the jacket.
I need this as an anime ASAP Rocky
As a FighterZ fan this looks amazing
On the one hand, this looks amazing and defintely a day one buy for me. On the other hand, i'm guessing thats the end of MVC4 for now.
So this is Marvel’s version of Dragon Ball Fighterz…
Let's go!!!!!!
Maximilian Dood is going crazy right now =D
Guilty Marvel so coool
Sleepwalker, Slapstick, Deathlok and Puck on the roster pls 🙏🙏🙏
ya r spazzing this year
These times truly go back when gaming was driven by the east instead of ran by the west. It is great to be back in form
I waited over 25 years for a 4vs4😂😂😂
Whats with the tag team bull, nobody wants that, we want a 1 vs 1 fight. Lame.
Okay I see you ArcSystemWorks, next up One Piece please!
I’m so happy for the team at Arcsys— this feels like such a labor of love, even from this brief introduction
Netease: finally a worthy opponent!
Sasuga doom sama
I guess im buying a ps5
close enough for me I'm excited for what looks like fighterz 2.
I recognize some of their VA. They previously did some Marvel Anime stuff. Glad they're reprising their roles in this
If this is gonna release in 2026 make sure it comes out before gta 6
Can we please get the light, heavy, fierce punches and kicks back!!?? PLEASE
Marvel’s making a 4 v 4 fighting game. If only they had a team associated with that specific number…
Storm always looks better and more comic accurate in these games than she does in the films!
Bro Marvel Games is COOKING
WHERE ARE ALL THE MUTANTS
Ay yo MAHVEL!?
YEEEEAAAHH
Special guest Characters i'd like to see! All Might, and Deku,  Saitama and Genos,
In XBOX please🙏🙏🙏
Anime marvel streetfighter
We need: Emma Frost, Rogue, Fênix, Invisible Woman,
Dude, arc system works, I lost it!!!!
OHHH MY GOOOODDDDDDD
4V4 in a fighting game is kind of crazy
It's Marvel vs Capcom without Capcom. Awesome
Marvel + Japan culture + fight game = PEAK
I ‘ll be looking forward to this game.
Yea I’m done with Xbox
Finally, Marvel Super Heroes 3!!!🤩
Now we’re talking
This is what we want! Fun and beautiful games
Bruh Gundam iron man ? Dude I want this now.
Does Doom not have foot dive?
Better Captain America design than in Marvel rivals
from the makers of dbfz?? this is about to be another one of the greatest fighting games of all time
Marvel KOF style 😮😮 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Is this marvel guiltygears?
2XKO is going to be stillborn
Ayo, Arcsys worked in this? It's gonna cook so hard
You people are such liars. You'll play the game 2 months and that'll be the end of it just like all other fighters online.
Cant wait for this game to launch with 3 Broken characters that dont get patched for months, obnoxious Touch of deaths off random interactions, a toxic meta revolving around an overtuned mechanic, and a several Top players getting exposed for being absolutely horrible human beings.  The next ten years are going to be a wild ride.
fire
Okay, is it just me or does Doom sound amazing in Japanese?
Marvel vs marvel 😂😂😂😂
We need Doom to say “Foot Dive!”
Glad that we’re past that early stage of the MCU where they stripped all the style out of Marvel games, this looks like a worthy spiritual successor to MvC
Gundam Iron Man??? Absolutely Peak Design Choice Bravo
Oh thank God they're getting back to the good stuff.
Im...slightly disappointed.  Eh well, lets see what they got
Please make Black Widow good. She deserves a chance to be cool again lol
So cool
Game looks fantastic, I wonder if we’re getting Jean Grey? 😏
worse iron man design in the history, and its amazing that normal iron man is ugly enough
I bet Spiderman fans are already hating the new suit.  They seem to always hate it whenever game devs give him a new unique suit.
DOOOOOOOOOD!!!!
Vision?
are they fighting in multiple arenas in one go?
If capcom had to lose the marvel license im glad it lost it to ASW. I don't play any of their games but i highly admire their art style. Ill deff play this one tho.
Close enough,  welcome back,  Marvel super heros.
Hell yeah!! I’m so looking forward to this game!!
Forget Marvel VS Capcom! 😍
Looks sick! Hope they have more characters, like 20 or so, but this looks great.
this looks good
Wow. Storm looks amazing. Especially after suffering from her mid design in Rivals for so long. Can't wait for this game.
“Thank god, now we can get rid of dragon ball fighterz….”
Get Wolverine and Squirrel Girl in this, I’ll get it day 1!
Storm's voice actress is Miyuki Sawashiro right?
These character designs look so good. Better than rivals imo
Goddamit man... Capcom fumbled hard.
Es muy similar al dragón bol faiters ? O soy el unico que lo nota😅
Was that the Robbie Reyes Ghost Rider? Awesome!
Asia still gonna wash american competitors at tournaments. Go1,kazunoko,Fenritti, tachikawa.
Bro Marvel Rivals now this? Marvel really cooking with their games recently
YEAH. japan is better at marval games then the west by miles. just hand them all the work please!!!
BRO I WANT DC
Yes!!!!!
Wow Maarvel got Guilty Gear company to do this game! They continue to make right choice it seems
1:55 DOOM bringing his iconic Foot Dive back
So sad it’s PlayStation exclusive
Of course, the blue guy and red guy would clash first in an Arc System Work game. Of course, it Steve and Tony, clashing with one another is second nature to them.
Why can’t ArcSys make the next Jump! Fighting game mannnnn
This is how Street Fighter 6 should have looked style wise.
It’s like Marvel versus Capcom, but just only Marvel I like it. 🔥
I doubt people involved will answer but, has the price of the game been decided?
Wooo MVM? Hell yeah! Wait...4on4?
Marvel games is on point Jesus Christ we waited decades for this
they gave ironman a V fin
It's like I said... we don't NEED new systems, we need the systems we already have to be MASTERED!!
I will only play if they have deadpool on release.
DOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!
Better than trash fighter 6
Warner Bros: Sir they just released another Marvel fighting game, shall we announce........it?  Ed boom: Not yet....let them enjoy this moment 😈
Yes
Let’s hope this goes well
It feels like this game was literally just made for me
They need to give doom a foot dive
The same guys who made DragonBallFighterZ, awesome.
My dreams actually came true
👀 0:55
Hey, they kept Spider-Man's classic catchphrase: "Spidey-sense!"   This looks dope
The seiyuu is awesome
No Freaking Way. I made a roster for an Arcsys Marvel fighter a year ago. The fact that they actually did it is blowing my mind.
Is it me or does this look like the exact animations to Dragon Ball FighterZ?
i just want my man Gambit in the game
So we got a Marvel Super Heroes but by Arcsys instead of Capcom.  Wise Choice, Marvel.
Had me at "Arc System Works"
To me it looks like a combination of MvC & DBFZ, probably due to Arc Systems being the devs of DBFZ.
So this is Marvel’s version of Injustice. Although I’ll admit Injustice had a Mortal Kombat feel, this feels more like street fighter. And I love it
So WHEN'S MAHVEL?
Marvel dumped Ryu and hooked up with Sol Badguy.  I approve.
Beautiful
If this is free to play it will be bigger than street fighter
Game already looks sweaty lol
Japan and China have now done American super Heroes better than America.
The gameplay looks EXACTLY the same as dragon ball fighterZ….
Save for Star-Lord's stupid stupid hair, & Storm's face, I love their interpretation of these heroes. The colors are also very bright,vibrant & dynamic.   4v4 is very surprising.
Arc system works broke the barrel. 4x4 tag team fighting game!!
Will there be X factor!?
I didn't expect Sawashiro Miyuki to voice as Storm.
Dragon ball fighterZ reskin
My hero academia CROSSOVER (?
Well this looks confusing.
this looks insane
Where's the english voiceovers
I WANNA TAKE YOU FOR A RIDE
I mean, is nobody talking about how this looks like a modded fighter z? (No hate but still)
Call me when Capcom joins.
Finally.... a marvel fighting game.
Marvel FighterZ 😩 I'm sold
We will be playing🫡
This would be lit on Switch 2
this looks like dragon ball fighterz with the marvel skin on top
Marvel nao nos desaponte 😢
Marvel superheros 1995 remake lol wow!!!!!!
Oh yess!!
If Doctor Doom doesn’t say “foot dive” I don’t want it
Bruh starlord got a BFG
DC games has been a little too quiet lately…
No Xbox?
C'est une copie de dB fighter Z
I wonder if this game will also be held together by goku
Trailer looks like doomsday movie cuz it's roumering that there will be multiple teams such as new avengerz , seam Wilson's avenger and x man teams too ❤
Why is it in Japanese
Well, maybe we'll never see another MVC, but at least it's another fighting game...tag team...
I'm glad we have this, but knowing that MvC is actually dead, it's bittersweet.
Please Marvel, hire Daisuke Ishiwatari to compose the OST. Just like what he did to Guilty Gear.
That game looks awesome. I can't wait to buy it when it comes out.
NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT'S NOT ON XBOX?!?! That's it, I'm buying a Steam Deck
Mravel VS Capcom v... With mods.
Captain America sounds perfect lol
Okay cool game ! I think special moves need to be a bit more cinematic !!! A little more over the top and anime esk
This looks so awesome
Marvel had one job: not make another tag team fighter 😭
Ah yes, Marveru Rivarusu
WHY IS IT WHEN A MARVEL GAME COME'S OUT IT'S ALWAYS ON F####### PLAYSTATION LIKE WHY DO THEY DO THIS TO ME?!?!?!? p.s. this is my opinion just to clarify.
Mahvel?
First it was Marvel Overwatch and now Marvel Street Fighter.
Thanks
So... That's a Street Fighter Marvel?
Wolverine?
OMG, AMAZING
Not Capcom got robbed by Arc System Works
É guity gear com outra skin..nada de novo
they ll do everything in the marvel skin...
SUPAIDAMAN IS BACK
Amazing. Bravo 👏 👏 👏  It's Mavel bby!!!
The Storm renaissance has been lovely. They are finally giving her back the spotlight she had in the 80s/90s
ITS MARVEL BABBBYY!!!!!
Sad that we might not see MvC4, but very excited to see what ASW is cooking with this. It's only the reveal trailer and it already looks miles ahead other games' reveals.
IN SOME YEARS WE ARE GOING TO PLAY MARVEL VS ARC SYSTEM
Its not mvc4... but it looks sick so I'm not complaining 🔥🔥🔥
I would be hyped If wasn't about Dragon Ball Fighterz with so many DLCs made for Arc System too and not having a single grappler main in the trailer that I have see.
Why is Star Lord so huge?
Way to go ASW!
Xbox?
close enough. welcome back UMvC3
This looks so freaking cool, but as an aging gamer of 33 years old, there's just too much on screen to pay attention to. Would get lost in the sauce 10/10.
Dr. Doom just pulling out a gun 😭
neat, now can we get Arc to make a Naruto game like this and DBZ FighterZ?
This looks 🔥🔥🔥
A Marvel fighting game from the creators of Guilty Gear.
Lastima que sera exclusivo uff
Marvel and anime comeback in an JPG style!!!!!! 🈲🎎🍙🎌
Wow wow wow!  Mahvel is back!!!
the hairs on my right arm rised up as i was watching, so my spidey senses are indeed tingling, this game gonna be awesome...also, now i know what i was missing in life, a japanese speaking dr doom.
We need marvel MOBA please. At least bring back Marvel Super War if you guys don't want to make a new one.
El nuevo Marvel rivals
rip guilty gear
Gundamised iron man😔
Dr. Doom pulling out a pistol to cap someone in the head is the funniest thing in the world to me. Knowing Doom, it's a multiversal wooden gun to prove he is better than Reed.
GIVE ME MOON KNIGHT AND DAREDEVIL AND MY LIFE IS YOURS 🗣🗣🔥🔥
Capcom felt that....millions of MVC fans are both happy....and sad......this looks amazing
Someone: (something) Storm: "Oh¹⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰···"
I really wish netherrealm studios made this game instead i really liked injustice and the mortal kombat games and style more
Okay so, anime style marvel fighting game made by ArcSys. 4v4...  HELL FREAKING YEAH
"Get your money up, not your funny up, Cap" -Ironman
nice!!
THIS LOOKS SO TUFF
Marvel vs capcom without the capcom
I absolutely adore the visuals
Japanese voice acting is 👍👍
😳 XBox!? What are y'all Doing!? Get off your pedestal and work towards adding this to your release schedule.
THIS IS THE GREATEST DAY
Japanese Captain America is some Kind of irony 😂
I want M'Baku.
MAHVEL IS BACK BABY
I want Jean Grey
Its good to see ghost rider after so long
here comes a mighty warrior xd
Bro this is anime mix with marvel and its a fighting game? Up wheres my wallet and time machine i want to go to the future and play this immediately
So all the anime is coming together
ADD CYCLOPS TO THE GAME PLEASE
4 team marvel fighting game. If the fantastic four isn’t in it then it’s a failure
Storm!!!! We need Thor though
Out of all games this yall could made an arena fighter but you make fighter z but marvel that’s so trash
Marvel fighting games are always a treat.
So that's where the HxH budget went... 😂
I cant for the fight intros you know how arc systems is with them.
When is Mahveru??
Marvel Rivlas fans trust you will love this game
i love what i just saw.. but i hate you for putting on PS5 and not PS4.. i hope there's only 8 playable characters LOL
Well well, Marvel 4 i think
1:52 why they jump spidey 😂
Crazy when dragon ball FighterZ came out and marvel vs capcom infinite dissapointed everyone i literally said they should.hire Arc system works to makes the next marvel ... at that time the meme was when's marvel in the fgc , well it's in 2026. But seriously  everyone is sold to the new thing but FighterZ is peak...
Who is the girl with the big arms and legs?
Yall better not cancel this
Street Fighter mixed with Marvel, and it's not a crossover! Awesome!
1987 was 1v1 1996 was 2v2 2000 was 3v3 2025 is 4v4  it's only a matter of time until we get the 5v5 tag fighter
Man and surprisely the Guilty gear people made this
Ok who added ms.marvel instead of other character 😂
THEY JUST TAKING OVER NOW
4 vs 4  fighting game will be interesting
I have the feeling lythero is going to play this with his friends when it gets released
you got like english or....?
An Anime Marvel Fighting game reveal was not on my bingo card.
ASW ON A MARVEL GAME ???? HOLD ON
Wow, unexpected, incredible announcement!
"What is this, some gatcha or mobile-like game?" *Arc System Works logo appears* "LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
same VA'S from rivals in Japanese nice
So Marvel Super Heroes 2?
I’ll mail yall my wallet later
Yeah Iron Man Gundam works
I love Dragon Ball Fighterz Marvel edition
Need baiken from guilty gear since they are the same studio who made this game
Marvel fighter Z
Finally, I can play Speedball in a Marvel game!
this game is going to be free or paid ?
These Marvel Rivals events are really getting weird
Dragon ball fighterz but marvel
Marvel Tōkon having better Dr Doom than Avengers Doom>
Hope we a least get the classic costumes. Some of theses designs....yikes
This the same engine as Fighterz? Seems like it.
So Americans can’t make good marvel games anymore I see
Wait... No Xbox?
I almost thought it would be Marvel vs Tokusatsu
Marvel v guilty gear when🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ms marvel is just dhalsim where cyclops
Basically looks like a DBFZ mod (I’m not saying this negatively)
Spidah-Man!!
…..everyone on the roster for Marvel Rivals needs to make their way over to this  Some how, some way. With characters like Daredevil and Blade being on the launch roster.
This reminds me a lot of Dragon Ball FighterZ, and as a fan of both that and Injustice. I'm so glad we got a Marvel vs Marvel fighting game. This looks really good
Getting canceled
Avengerusu Assemboruu!!!
Spider sense as a catch phrase? R u kidding?
Why’s it in Chinese?
Holy hell Doctorate Doom
THIS IS INCREDIBLE, i cant believe marvel fighting games came back through ARC??? so excited for this!!!
LET'S GO!!!!!
Arc be like "anything but a Blazblue only game"
Boooooooooooooooooooring 💤💤💤💤💤
Japan is apparently allergic to titles that make sense, did Tetsuya Nomura sneak into the meeting?  Nobody outside of the weeaboo sphere is even going to try to decipher what on earth "Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls" means. This is like if Rivals was instead called "Marvel Zentkaksu: Soul Expansion".
IMAGINE PLAYING AS THE ENTIRE FANTASTIC 4
Tag team with side selection please, and then I'll insta buy. I want to fight with my friends, not against them. Looking great🎉
Those insufferable japanese screams are going to drive me insane within one hour of gameplay
We really needed this😊
Kinda wild how you can make a trailer for a game where most of the cast are mainstays still feel hype and fresh. Kinda excited for this now.
Is that Supaidaman? Or Peter?
It really looks like fire but why do they wanna make every marvel game anime?
My body is ready for this. This is hella awesome.               ...Also, why tf is none of my comments ever getting likes? a comment done an hour after mine gets 500+ and comments an hour after already 1k+ I don't care much about the like stuff, but just something I noticed for about a year practically. Does YouTube have me shadow banned or something? Depending on the video the only like a may get is from the content creator themselves, but that's it. Whole thing just seems weird since it's been this ongoing phenomenon with me/this account. Or maybe I'm just that much of a loser, who knows.
What!! The!! ACTUAL!! FUDGE!! I'M NOT READY FOR THIS!! Forget Marvel vs Capcom collection.
MARVEL GAMES IS COOKING RIGHT NOW IM SO EXCITED
so you are telling me anime marvel would work? 😭😭
Wut? 😮
Where the HELL did this come from?!
Nova, Gambit, Nightcrawler, Doctor Octopus and Human Torch please
plz plz don't let this game down. have a higher roster than street fighter or mvc.  add more xmen , deadpool , avengers, midnight suns, young avengers, spiderverse, ALLLL THE LIKE.
Why couldn't there be a Marvel fighting game that looks as good as injustice 2 all these Anime marvel games are just not it.
Not on XBOX 😢 guess i will play it on steam😢
Me
Ghost Rider Robbie Reyes, HELL yes!!! I'm usually not a bigger fighter game.person but I'm getting this for my boy Robbie! Also, the art style is beautiful! Marvel Legends fifures of every character when?
Am getting figthers z vibes and am loving it
ROBBIE REYES FINALLY HES IN A GOOD LOOKING GAME 😭😭😭😭
why are they speaking japanese
DOOM DOES NOT RUN!!!  HE WALKS MENANCINGLY (1:23  AND ON 1:28)
Capcom: EY!!! THIS IS MINE!!!!
Waiter….WAITER!!!!! THATS NOT WHAT I ORDERED!!!!!!!!🤬🤬🤬
where can i PRE-ORDER? idc i want to buy it NOW!!!!! lol
Mahvel itsedesu ka senpai
i hope spiderman will say "its gonna be sticky"🤡
Just take ms.marvel out of the game and i promise you it's a 10/10
i guess this means no marvel vs capcom anytime soon... PASS
1:14 You can see Daredevil peeking through the window on the left
The same company behind guilty gear, blazblue, and dargonball fighterz
I swear star Lord is just Dante gun combo copy past from marvel vs Capcom
Marvel vs marvel gear strive
Cook marvel games
os vazamentos eram verdades...
Que jogo lindo.
If you want Battlefront 3 get this to the top!
It looks amazingggggg..  love love love the art style
I’m just glad my girl Kamala has her real powers, none of that dumb light construct stuff from the live action
Is basically guilty gear strive with tag team, it look very good, but I dont know what the hell play station studios has to do with the game, this is complete work of arcsys
*OMG YESS!!! YES!!! LET’S GO!!!* 💙💙💙
marvel is so back
This is like marvel dbfz
I'm guessing PlayStation exclusive ;_;
Dang. I hope it comes for the Xbox too. I have all platforms but I still want to play with my friends who don’t have all the other games systems.
Marvel vs Capcom, Marvel Rivals, Marvel Tōkon. Sheesh, at least let DC rent the kitchen 😭
"Gonna take you for a riiiide" onegaishiimasu.
Rip mvc4
Looks excellent; hope they don’t make it too difficult to play.
2XKO?  WHAT'S THAT?!  😂🤣😂🤣
This gives me Z fighters vibes and I'm for it
James Gunn kidnapping Ed Boon into the woods with a grave dug out, telling him to start working on Injustice 3 ASAP.
No Foot Dives?  Really?
Finally they got injustice but for marvel
I hope they have more characters, I know this is just the reveal trailer so very early
A new Marvel Super Heroes fighter? And *4v4? That sounds... Fantastic!*    🗣️ "It's Clobberin' Time!" 👨 👱‍♀🔥🗿
HOLY DEAR LORD RIGHT INTO MY VEINS!!!
So Marvels version of FighterZ?
LETS GOOOOOO A MARVEL VS CAPCOM GAME BUT JUST ALLLL MARVEL???
Arcsys been cooking lately
sol badguy is going to be here?
Marvel FIGHTERZ!!!!!!
Shame it's not on Xbox, Exclusive kill the gaming ...
FOOT, FOOT-DIVE!!!
switch 2??? plz
Capcom f**ked up so bad with Infinite they completely lost the marvel IP to Arcsys 😂😂
Nothing said Japan as Ironman Helmets looling like a Gundam
If there No Wolverine or Psylocke I don’t want it
THAT WAS AWESOME!!
THANK YOU🎉
I know this is early footage, but I feel a weird hit lag or pause after every hit, like auto combos with cinematic flair, seems realy different from other games from Arcsys
Marvel vs Capcom without the Capcom  Nah but jokes aside this game looks dope!
arc system made this you know they gonna cook
This looks so F***** GOOD
First they made Marvel Overwatch now Marvel Street Fighter
this looks f*cking awesome!✨
marvel is cooking i need this game now
Definitely buying this!!
Hell yeah Arc systems and Marvel what a badass combo!!
Marvel Knows how to FEED US
surprised they got a popular fighting studio like ark for this, but, they do have the money. More like did not suspect the collab with the IP  4x4 sounds interesting on paper, but sounds messy in execution, in terms of proper selection in the heat of battle
Marvel fighter z finna go stupid
No footdive?
So this is PS exclusive?😢
God storms JP voice is sooo familiar like ive been playing her as a dif char for years but i cant place it
I am SO back
these costume designs looks SO GOOD
The king is dead(MvC), long live the king.
This is the true sequel to MVC3 not MVCI.
1:08 ROBBIE REYES?!😭🙏
Arc Systems are amazing for this...I hope it actually has depth
WOOOOOW!
Marvel finally got their own fighting game!
I know the game hasn’t came out yet… but I’m predicting marvel vs guilty gear !!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
this is a weird Marvel Rivals update
So this is what fighterz lost its final life support on? welp imma call it now Spidey will be the UI Goku of this game. Now who will be our ssj vegeta?
This looks incredible. THIS is how you sell/hype a game up.
1:17 That Star-Lord to Cap to Doom move though-
Doom just pulling a fricking glock is perfect.
ghost rider going to turn into scorpion
Marvel vs Marvel: fate of 2 marvels
Ig stark is into Gundam
INCREIBLE.
Is there an English dub 😂
This is awesome. Also when will we get the Future Avengers? Specifically Makoto, Chloe and Adi?
I am so ok not understanding what they are saying. It looks awesome sign me up
Im ready to be taken for a ride!
Wow reminds me of Capcom vs Marvel.
Marvel vs Marvel
wanna  say it looks amazing in every way and Even someone like me who quit FGS is excited .  👏👏👏
Scarlet witch, blade,moon Knight and sentry plz
LETS GOOOOOO!!!!!!
okay well this is an insta buy
Dragon ball fighterz reskin
ROBBIE REYES ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
GHOST RIDDDERRRRR
when people people asked for the marvel 4, im pretty sure they didnt meant 4v4 🤣
On one hand that probably push the possibility of a MvC games back a few years, on the other hand this sound incredible.  Give me some FF and i'm sold.
This gotta be the most excited for a fighting game I’ve been since fighterz this looks so gas
sick.... another fighting game i can watch sonic fox annihilate everyone
This is how Marvel vs Capcom should looks like
pelo amor de Deus controle com 6 botões que n seja igual os ultimos marvel vs capcom que o cara faz com 2 botões
Arc System Works. Dragon Ball Fighterz.  Now, Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls. I feel we are closing in on MARVEL × SHONEN JUMP.  Anybody feel that?
I never thought I needed this game until today!!
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
THIS IS HOW I WANTED 3D MARVEL VS CAPCOM TO BE
1:55 FOOTDIVE
waaaaaaaaoouuu ese juego va ser buenisimo
This was a pleasant surprise. 🔥 💪🏾
Nah, DC Is Cooked!!
Words can’t describe how happy I am today….
This is beautiful...
The best part: No Xbox ❤️
Fingers crossed for more X-men. I wanna play as night crawler & magik
Marvel starting another generational run on the Gaming industry
Maaan. Another juggle fighter. At least we're getting a new virtua fighter finally. Wish the fighting genre had more diversity of gameplay than 'land hit, opponent sets down controller and lets the long animation play out until KO'. Always just boils down to some boring meta team lineup that lets someone spam the same mechanical combo they saw in a tournament stream. Over and over.
Whhhhhhhaaaaatttt!!!!!!!!!! No waaaaayyyyyy!!!!!!!
I am expecting Guilty Gear guest characters
Namor: TOTSUGEKI!
ArcSystem do what capcomdont!
Souls 😂😂😂😂
ahahahaa riot so slow marvel making the same game with teamupswapping or whateever u want to call it
Amazing, absolutely amazing. I'm too excited for this.
So marvels gunning for both blizzard and riot, interesting.
Marvel when it comes to comics and movies: 🤮  Marvel when it comes to games: 😎
This is just perfect....
So hyped IT Looks so awesome and Epic 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😊😊😊😊😊🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🫶🫶🫶 Arc system works Always delivers with their ultra cool Anime fightng games😁😁😁😁🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗😍🤗 Also Loving all the new Marvel Games with their Epic Styles 😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩💖💖💖😊😊😊 (rivals, tokon and mystic Mayhem)
banco muchísimo las voces en japonés bldo asjdjas
I see Robbie I'm sold
goodbye capcom
I'm here.
I was excited untill the Robbie Reyes version of Ghost Rider came out.
Marvel Sans Capcom 4
Please let Doom have that one stomp move from MvC i'm begging you...
I would've loved a BB x GG game from ArcSys, but this works just fine.
From the creators of guilty gears.
I hope to see Psylocke in this game.
Robbie Reyes Ghost Rider 💙 and Storm looks amazing 🥰
Doom shooting someone with a pistol saying "There is only Doom"... Masterpiece
Good stuff. Looks better than the last Marvel vs Capcom.
Marvel minus Capcom
I Hope they add Other guardians of the Galaxy (Rocket, Drax, Gamora, Groot), Doctor strange, Squirrell girl and "DEADPOOL!!!!!".
WHENS MAHVEL
Not sure if this means that no new marvel Vs capcom is ahead but It looks awesome!!, (I would like similar treatment for a king of fighters game by arc systems alongside SNK)
Wow. DB FIGHTERZ Syle with Marvel characters. SIGN ME UP
street fighter 6 marvel edition
Marvel is already doing great in the game side.
dude, even Iron Man's suit has a Gundam V-fin on it... ❤😢
BEEN WAITING FOR THIS since they did dragon ball!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
why no capcom ?
Please don't make the story mode super difficult like Marvel Vs Capcom infinite did. I'm so excited for this game to come out omg
This is like Marvel's version of DBFZ I like it
Don't forget to put Magneto, Sentinel, Psylocke and Cable, thanks for already confirming Storm
So, here are some of my thoughts: 1. 4v4?! I saw the video where Maximilian Dood said that a 4v4 fighting game would be impossible until someone finds a way to make it work. And now here we are. Funny how the universe works. 2. I noticed the animation is a bit different from the recent Arc Sys fighting games. Tittles such as Guilty Gear Strive and Dragon Ball FighterZ have choppier animation to emulate hand drawn animation. But the characters in this game move a bit more smoothly. Interesting. 3. With Arc Sys making a Marvel fighting game, it makes me question the future for Marvel vs Capcom. I guess this means we won't be getting a MvC4, which is sad, but at least this game looks awesome. Maybe Capcom can make a crossover fighter with their own characters.
So they have one with China and another with Japan. Nice
Has Miss Marvel ever been more popular than Mr. Fantastic? I always found her live action tv series more interesting than her comic book adaptation.
They’re still hiding the X-men. This doesn’t bring me good vibes. But Arc is on board, so it may be good. At least will be pretty.
Bucciarati? *DIAVOLO??* Oh man i already love this!
soooo... MVC3 without the C?
There ain't no FUNCTIONS in this Marvel game. They got Storm and Cap and Spidey and DOOM. This is going to be a GOAT
Doom appears "WHERE'S THE FOOT DIVE?!"
Really? Kamala Khan? Did you not learn from Avengers. And not Johnny Blaze Ghost Rider. Rivals was a fluke.
storm looks like a baddie 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Marvel fr saw people online say "DC games better" and said "Challenge accepted"
YES FCKING YESSS!!!
Whaaaat....
Kind of reminds of fighterz and guilty gear
Marvel fighterZ
Ah. That's where all the budget for HxH went...
Ain't no way we in the same universe!!🤯  Nahh lemme not get my hopes up too high but....this has potential
This looks incredibly fun.
Looks sick but I'm not buying it unless it's english dubbed
Bro Spiderman's neck... Someone else see it weird tho?, but my lord iron man Gundam hits different
I was hoping for Marvel vs Capcom 6 😂
IT'S MAHVEL BABEY LET'S GOOOOO!!!
Friendship ended with Capcom, Arc Sys is my new bestfriend.
I always wanted to play MARVEL FighterZ
God I can't wait to see Lythero play this
I'm done I'm tired I hate it , it could've been great if it wasn't tag I'm tired tag team fighting games all I wanted was a game like marvel superheroes or x men children of the atom I loved tag games but almost every new fighting game based on a franchise is tag based I get why it's fun, but I'm just tired of tag , of course no one else cares it will probably be amazing but I'm just tired
Captain America is the EFFIN GOAT! 🐐
Someone tell DC gaming take the throne back
I knew i heard Max screaming in the distance
Capcom: do you really think you can make your own without me fighter?  Marvel: no, but they can Arc sys: ...
DC better drop another good Batman or they cooked game wise
Where's Xbox and Switch 2? Kinda silly omission.
IT'S MARVEL BABY
SONIC FOX GRAND FINALS
From the time I saw Arc System Works, I knew what to expect... greatness. Marvel, please don't cancel this game.  Also, it's good to see you're back into game development with your own Studio again.   One other thing....can you convince Disney to make a Sequel to Split Second?  That would be great.
It’s Mahvel baby (but no Capcom)
MARVEL FANS EATING GOOD!
STARS AND STRIPES
I’m getting a major dragon ball fighter Z vibe from the animation
I wished they’d just remaster that old marvel fighting game. I think it was called Marvel Nemesis
So Gojo is Captain America now.. cool!
If yall make this game either free or significantly cheaper than box price and prioritize selling cosmetics and taunts and customization options like player cards etc etc… this could be the biggest game of all time. But please no scummy predatory monetization, use the weight of the ip for the exposure, and then if the monetization is fair and cheap everyone will spend their money on this game. This could put fighting games on top again it could be that big. PLEASE DONT FUMBLE THE BAG I BELIEVE IN YOU ARCSYS
I DEMAND SQUIRREL GIRL!! Arc Sys already made Makoto for BlazBlue so they have the experience already lol!
🗣️GHOST RIDER MAINS WHERE YOU AT?!?!?!?
Please no more xmen characters 🙏
Looks sick but 4v4 sounds exaggerated
Thank God it’s on pc too, if this gets steam deck verified I’ll lose it!
That was amazing!
So Arc Systems killed Marvel vs Capcom with Dragon Ball Fighterz, then revived it by creating their own Marvel crossover
Va a salir primero está madre que el dichoso 2xko.
Also I love that Iron Man has that classic spiked symbol you see on a lot of Mechas in Sentai shows or Mecha anime. 😆
Whoa!!! Amazing ❤  Please 50 characters at least
Marvel does what Warner don't
RIP HXH NEN IMPACT
MAKE A PRETTY CURE FIGHTING GAME ALREADY,ARCSYS!!!
Do I love this? yes. Do I wish the roster was less cliché? 10000% but love to see Ghost Rider, Kamala and queen Storm. Hoping the roster gets Jean, Rogue, Wanda, Wiccan, Miles Morales and Spider Gwen.
I haven’t been this excited for a fighting game in a while!!! 🔥
Capcom is FINISHED
Tokon!
Please make vergil and dante , and asura wrath as dlc. Please marvel
Soooooooo READY!!!!!!!
WTAF!
I really hope the fantastic four are finally playable in a 2d fighting game 😭
I’m genuinely crying tears of joy rn
Marvel games transition 0:51 1:11
MAHVEL BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
They saw rivals dying and immediately got to work
im actually shedding tears rn
I wanna see Wolverine and Sol Badguy throw down
Take My moNEY AND ...............
FINALLY! A MARVEL FIGHTING GAME THAT IS SOLELY MARVEL! WE HAVEN’T SEEN ONE OF THOSE IN NEARLY 30 YEARS!  PS: I am NOT counting the X-Men Game for Hyperscan that came out in 2006. That thing should be considering a crime against humanity.
Acs System cames again to save Marvel vs series 😅
Pelo menos ai eles usam máscaras.
This looks great! I hope it will be on Xbox
recently gotten bored of tekken and have been playing a lot of rivals so i'm super excited for this!
When I tell y’all I screamed when I saw Ms. Marvel…  We have KAMALA KHAN in the base roster! Yes! 🙌🏽⚡
take... my... MONEY! 2026 cannot come soon enough! Arc Systems as usual know what they're doing. What a fresh take on a Marvel fighting game :)
I like the art style. Well done.
This looks so amazing man
Loki, The Thing, Red Hulk, Sentry, Shang Chi and Scarlet Witch are a few new faces I would like to see in this game! 🤞🏾💪🏾
With 4 v 4, sounds like we might get a big roster of characters.  I hope Moon Girl/Devil Dinosaur is one fighter
Holy crap.
Mortal Kombat? ✋🏾😔 Marvel Kombat? 👈🏾😌
Iron Man looks like Gurren Lagann
Looks nice. But something about it feels off. I'm sure it'll get polished by then. Looking forward to it.
This trailer has shook the entire universe 🔥😭🤣😂
>American comic book super heroes speaking Japanese Excellent
An anime marvel fighting game was not on my bingo list for 2025, but I’ll take it nonethless
Dr. Doom’s canon eye color is brown…
This is terrible no one wants this marvel is in new york this bad
Storm is amazing ❤ Finally, Marvel vs Marvel ❤
Arcsys said "We ain't waiting for Marvel 4"
Who else already love it after just seeing it?
My prayers have been answered, no more Capcom characters I couldn't care less about.
Ghost Rider day one purchase shut up and take my money already
Finally, an answer to injustice
Bro yells “SPIDEY SENSE” like a Stand Ability
It's Mahvel, baby!!
Already know miles is gonna do the chidroi in this game
Wait, is Yuichi Nakamura voicing Captain America? I recognised that voice!  He's my favourite VA!
Sweet ❤
LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
this makes me wish so bad that i was good at fighting games...
Looks cool
I recognize some FighterZ devs here
ROBBY REYES BABY 🔥
Oh my God😱, this looks dope💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼😎👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
SUPAIDAMAN!!
I wanna see the germs get good at this and block a 65 hit combo
LET'S GO!!   Marvel Super Heroes VS..... Marvel Super Villains?!
Hope the roster and the size is up to snuff, otherwise it already looks amazing!
Where’s my king Black Panther? 🐈‍⬛
marvel cooking w all these games
Meh, this doesn’t interest me
Capcom lost on this one, but they will come back strong with Capcom vs SNK 3.
I just KNOW people are gonna whine about Ghost Rider at launch
IRON MAN LOOKS LIKE VIEWTIFUL JOE, I'm literally CRYING RIGHT NOW. This artstyle as an MVC4 with 4v4 would have been PEAK, alas.
Take my money
0/10 didnt see a single doom foot dive
Marvel 4 before GTA6?
Art direction is fire
Not being MVC4 is a straight crime...but Tokon straight up said Fine, Ill do it Myself! and to that I respect. Interested but kinda sour ngl.
Finally! Yuukyan as Cap!
arc system is about to cook again
Loki...putting us on the sacred timeline with this one
Not on Xbox or switch smh
This is like injustice but Marvel 😊
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
Yoooooo!!!!
I won’t lie, I am so excited for this! Especially since Arc System Works is the one making it! The only thing, I wish the Ghost Rider in it was one of the Ghost Riders before Robbie. Not that I dislike Robbie, I just prefer the Hellcycle over his car.
I feel like the Fighterz modding community already made this game?
Its same a dbzf
Looks like peak to me
OMG, say less and take my money!! 🤩
VERY PROMISING
Hvor er Thor? Ogsa, mer Engelsk med ingen Japansk. Takk
2XKO going straight to DVD
It looks good but the roster looks very safe. Nice to see Ghost Rider but I hope we get more heroes not made famous by movies.
2026?! Ugghh! But I wanna play Dr Doom NOW
Why they do marvel like this
The multiverse just got a lot weirder 😂.
Storm is SO BEAUTIFUL!!!! I love the Character designe!!! Congratulations!! After Marvel Rivals these designes are AWESOME!!!
Marvel Vs Capcom without Capcom.
MARVEL 4 BABY
HOLY SHIIIIIIIIIIIII THEY ARE SO ANIME, ARCSYS COOKED
They knew what they were doing with dr doom with him not being playable in another certain marvel game.
IT'S A GOOD DAY TO BE A FIGHTING GAME FANATIC
Maximilian Dude is gonna lose his mind.
Looks absolutely gorgeous!! 10/10!! Let’s go Arc System!
Glad to my boy Robbie get some love 🤩
Why no English VA out of the gate!?
500 steps closer to my dream crossover game: Marvel vs Shonen Jump
Doom aura walking 🤣😭
If mk1 was good:
The DLC's on this game is about go craaazzzy!!  I'm hyped!
Oh cool a marvel fighting game...  MADE BY ARCSYS?
We’res Deadpool and wolverine?
We finally have *Marvel FighterZ*
No Xbox?
Yep, definitely preordering
😍😍😍😍
No no no, stop. What did you do to Iron Man and Captain America. Also, if you're giving Doom a pistol, make it actually look imposing/advanced.
is like dragon ball fighters but Marvel Version.
Please please please have an English dub
Doctor Doom try not to have the coldest walk challenge (IMPOSSIBLE) So is his entire moveset, bro is just straight up aura farming constantly 😭
marvel vs capcom rip?
If the Fantastic Four are in this, I'll be infinitely happy.
Don't do us Rivals players dirty. Definitely drop these designs as skins.
close enough. welcome back Marvel Superheroes
Marvel fighter z looks pretty lit
It's... Marvel vs. Capcom, sin Capcom, con Arc System Works  oh my god
That's a sublime Doom voice!
Marvel forgot about mobile games 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ this a perfect mobile game
SUPAIDAMAAN DA
GHOST RIDEEEER, DOOM
Marvel gaming is back
Rip MVC 4
Rip my life. time to catch the fades with ppl left n right
Sick 🔥🔥
Finally! Dragonball Fighterz 2. I love the new skins!
So probably no Marvel vs Capcom 5. A proper Capcom All Star fighting game someday?
ARC SYSTEM!!! I LOVE IT!!!!
yay marvel vs camcom but iwth marvel i think im gonna go crazy and happy playing rivals and this
Can't wait to do this to be either on the switch of the switch 2
fire!
W 😮🎉
Yeeeeeeeees
0:30  Janet Van Dyne building (aka The Wasp) Dazzler poster Lockjaw on a sticker (the teleporting dog from the Inhumans) Norman Osborn Poster (and Oscorp building) Hellfire Club Baxter Building Daily Building (mentioning Gargantos aka Shuma-Gorath) Roxxon "No more Mutants" graffiti (Reference to Wanda's line at the end of House of M)  0:57  Thor as part of the Avengers statue  1:15 Fogwell's Gym (Related to Daredevil as it was where their father was murdered with The Hand insignia on the doorframe) Matthew Murdock in the left window of the Nelson & Murdoch building (Where Murdock aka Daredevil works) Damage Control (The company that cleans up after Superhero fights destroy the city for the umpteenth time) The giant tentacles presumably belong to Gargantos  All the references I could spot, probably missed a few.
I wonder of Dr DOOM will have a foot dive
So... it's MvC but without Capcom mixed with Injustice
Now this is marvel infinite! Can't wait to see hulk, hopefully Ultron, blackheart, super skrull, juggernaut and shuma gorath
years of capcom hell, marvel chose arksys heaven
¡Por fin! Un juego de Marvel de Vs, lo malo es que no es en 3D, pero por lo menos están ellos solos y no acompañados de otra gente que ocupe el lugar de los personajes Marvel, que es lo que nos merecíamos
Great….ANOTHER fighting game. Not like any of us want an open world adventure, that’s a silly thing to hope for I suppose.
I see you Arc...
Oh! If it's in Japan can we get Sakura Spider or Octo Girl from the Manga Spider-Man: Octo-Girl? Well Sakura Spider did appear from Deadpool Samurai first.
We got ghost rider in a video game before GTA 6 dropped. What a time to be alive😂😂😂😂
This looks cool!  Nice to see a stand alone Marvel fighting game again! (X-Men: Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes did it first)  As for I want to see in this game! Deadpool, Shuma-Gorath and Aero!
Bro, the background stage is amazing with references. i see Avengers Tower, the Baxtor building, billboards for Luna Snow and Dazzler, Nelson and Murdock bro this looks amazing Marvel is definitely stepping on to the stage with these games mam🔥🔥🔥
Marvel vs Arc System Works will come
Marvel Fighterz?
Diavolo voicing ghost rider is peak
Close enough welcome back MAHVEL
Okay as cool as this was, I still miss Marvel vs Capcom(Infinite just had to be a massive disappointment huh?😔).
Marvel FighterZ
A 4 v 4? What are announced gonna call that collateral, an Anniversary?
Pretty sure storm said something about his mama 😬
I rather play this than play rivals
no wolverine?
Dazzler reveal when?!
Marvel got so salty about Capcom putting Shuma in they ended up going to Arc for the next game
This looks amazing! Now bring way more X-Men. We need at least Psylocke, Wolverine, Magneto, Iceman, Cyclops and Phoenix.
YESSS YEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSS
While I'm a little crushed it isn't another MvC, I am 1000% here for this. I would still love an MvC4, and I think they could be different enough to coexist in the same market, but I'm perfectly fine with this.
Marvel just letting Asia make all it's games
these fighting games players have been eating good these last couple of years
MAHVEL IS BACK BABY
2XKO is dead. IT'S MARVEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GHOST RIDER YESSSS MY LIFE IS YOURS!!!
Ill buy this... I wish they bring back the Arcade system for fighting games where we unlock each character through 1 playthrough...
doom just pulls out a blicky and shoots you in the back of the head
Not Iron Man and Spidey jumping my goat 💔
Looks pretty rad
Star lord moving like gambit or Donte
Ummmmmm idk how to feel, im hyped but also extremely unimpressed 😵‍💫
Son los creadores de dragon ball fighterz? Los movimientos y combos se ven muy similares
doom got the gat
A modern marvel fighting game has been a dream of mine for years, they’re finally doing it 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Marvel: Fine… I’ll do it myself.
Marvel ball fighterZ. Let's go🗣️🗣️
Initial reaction: oh this is not marvel vs capcom. After watching trailer: HOL UP THIS IS ACTUALLY KINDA FIRE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It’s mahvel baby!
Esto es asombroso
Marvel is on a generational run
Ain't no way we actually getting a Vs. game but it's Marvel vs. Marvel
Marvel, if you’re going to license out your ip please make it available to as many people as possible. A Marvel fighting game on just two platforms is such a retrograde step. If you’d have gone with a different partner you could be including Switch and Xbox gamers too.
I need this on the Nintendo Switch 2.
The designs are so fire
OKAY NOW WE'RE TALKING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I hope we get these as skins in marvel rivals
Deltarune today? I thought you said MARVEL TODAY
Awesome.
I swear they better put these on arcades too.
Kamala's face looks very different from everyone else, it looks way to cartoony
Pls tell me that this will also come to pc
A Marvel vs Marvel game, that looks better than a Marvel vs Capcom … what?!
Oh shoot, I didn't think doom was packing heat, I almost forgot he had a gun
Bro if this means mvc4 is done or capcom isn't making marvel fighting games then i don't know man
"SPIDEYYYY SENSE!!"
Yo this looks goated
If there's no Doom's Foot Dive istg I'mma crash out
So Capcom released the Marvel vs Capcom collection, updated it with new music and balance changes, and now we're getting a marvel tag fighter Oh jeez I wonder what this could be leading to It could anyone's guess really
Marvel hero academia
FOOT DIVE
WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT??? I THOUGHT THIS WAS MARVEL RIVALS???
Flop
I want a PlayStation now😭😭😭
4 vs 4 seems a bit too much for me
Even though it's not MvC4 I'm still hella down for Dragon Ball FighterZ but with marvel characters instead.
Omg can’t wait looks amazing and stage transitions this is the most excited I’ve been about a fighting game in a very long lmtimr
Im Maining Spider-man
4 vs 4 is wild
Let's goooo 🔥 I'll definitely be playing this
MARVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEL
no marvel vs capcom 4 I guess
WHEN’S MAHVEL?! 👀  2026
Is there’s a option that allows you to do a 1v1 without a tag team up
Mid... awful character design
Aw man a 2D foghter
¿Where is CAPCOM? 😢
This is so garbage. Its so slow and boring, and the character designs are tame and censored.
Marvel still trying to astroturf ms. marvel I see...
Bruh, Spiderman and Ms. Marvel are 2 of my favorite Marvel heroes, they are practically gonna be on my team all the time.  If they end up getting English voice actors, I hope they get Iman Vellani or Sandra Saad to voice Ms. Marvel.  For Spidey, it HAS to be Yuri Lowenthal!!!
We got marvel guilty gear before GTA 6
NEW ARCSYS GAME HELL YEAH
As an MVC fan, I'm simultaneously so excited and so sad. Godspeed Arc Sys... we're counting on you.
Present 1 Hours
I'm ready for The Sentry.
Rip marvel vs capcom :(
Cheat codes
THIS LOOKS INSANE!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
1:12 Man this really is just a back and forth between places.
Someone pinch me, this can't be real
Marvel vs Capcom but without Capcom
now give me rocket
Can someone translate?
I wonder how Capcom feels about this. Like the Marvel vs Capcom series is right there...  But I will definitely take another Arc Sys game!
I loved dragon ball fighterz this is amazing
If this version of Spider-Man isn't the emissary from hell SU-PAI-DA-MAN! himself I'm going to be disappointed
Would have preferred a 1v1 but tag fighter is fun too I guess.
Beefiest Star Lord I seen in a hot minute
OMG hyyyyype maaaaaaaax
siempre los mismos pjs
I'm literally crying... 😭❤️  I've said it before, I'll say it again, Arc System Works is what Capcom used to be! They have a catalog of current BEAUTIFUL and BADASS games and not just a flagship game. Guilty Gear, Blazblue, Granblue, DNF Duel (Y'all shouldve supported that more!), Dragon Ball FighterZ, now Marvel Tokon! Capcom made me a fighting game player but Arc System Works has my heart!🏆
After all these years, i can finally footdive on a real Marvel fight game...
marvel vs marvel 😭
Capcom has 24 hours to respond with Capcom Vs SNK 3
Cool.
Omgaaaaahd this is soo lit
Yes, Marvel vs...Marvel? Still excited tho
MARVEL SUPER HEROES 2......30 years in the making XD
And Xbox?
There's subtitles! Turn them on!
C’mon, Capcom. Give us Capcom Fighting Evolution 2. Just make it good. You did it before (Street Fighter 1 to Street Fighter II)! I have faith in you!
So whats the reason they're fighting each other? Skrulls? Multiverse? Beyonders contest of Champions?
This was the game that took over the show. Fantastic - hope we can wishlist soon.
Praying for an xbox release, but knowing Sony it's not going to happen
World martial arts champion (世界武道チャンピオン), SUPAIDAAMAN!
Yes!!!!!!! That's a good stuff
Animation looks so clean can't wait to play this one. Hopefully more content to unlock playing instead of buying
Most unexpected but welcomed surprise of the show ❤
Maining Ghost Rider!
The marvel vs capcom/injustice killer
Why didn't Iron Man just use maximum pulse?
não vai ter pra PS4???😢😢😢
Contest of Champions looking at this be like:
This game gonna be so good. I really need this
Locking to 1 console doomed to fail
Dbfz but marvel… I’m so down
Ah.  Well, the rope & rickety stool can be placed in storage for a while again.
I guess Marvel got fed up with the realistic art style and since Capcom is forcing that style into their games now, Marvel no longer saw Capcom as the right fit for a new game and instead moved on to a company with a more anime style.
Friendship ended with Capcom, now Arc System Works is my best friend
IS THAT ROBBIE MFING REYES?
We are so back
MY WALLET IS YOURS
Im sure we're gonna see alot of characters from the upcoming Doomsday. Omy gosh imagine playing Sentry
CLOSE ENOUGH WELCOME HOME MVC4
Yes Mv... Nevermind, it's Marvel Fighterz??!
Finally the emissary of hell: spider man is back
Team villains is going to be crazy Green Goblin , Magneto, Dr Doom, Apocalypse
is... is it mahvel baybee?
YO CANNONS.....I DON'T MEAN ANY DISRESPECT BUT UUUHHHH, TAKE NOTES!!!
You are telling me. A man who is a GOD at FighterZ, is getting a MARVEL Fighterz, in the same time as us getting a MARVEL OVERWATCH. truly, we are in the peak timeline.
We finally got an answer to the age old question!!  When's mahvel??
LETS GO
which studio is responsible for this
Next is………….Marvel vs DC
Needs gambit
The Spiderman in this is giving me Emissary from Hell energy. 😭
Marvel is steadily realizing their next cash cow isn't movies, but fighting team-based multipliers with aweseomly over the top character design
MARVEL VS MARVEL
And they made storm a baddie thank u lord!!!
MAHVEL IS BACK 😭😭
Bro I can’t wait to see Wolverine and the rest of the X-men , hopefully we get nightcrawler
ARC SYS! GIVE DOOM HIS FOOTDIVE! AND MY LIFE IS YOURS!!!!
Everyone notice how Xbox isn’t up there? Sony doing more gatekeeping I see 😓
needs more capcom
YAYYYYY MS MARVEL!!!
WHAT???!!!!
They called me crazy for saying we wouldn't get Marvel VS Capcom 4. I was proven right. And I hate it.
YES.
This was not in my "games for the next decade" bingo card
It is wrong to have bad feeling about this? Because Black panther game just got cancelled a week ago, i afraid this also suffer the same terrible end
(Monkey brain) WHERE FOOTDIVE? OO-OO, W-WHERE FUUT DYVE??
A bit sad that it isn’t Marvel vs Capcom but also hyped that marvel is investing into fighting games that have good artistic design and styling much less fighting games at all on their own call
I wanna see Hulk and hope they choose danny rand as iron fist
BRUUUH THATS SO SICKKKKKKKKK
Finally MvM
私たちは、こうゆうのを求めてたよー🥰🥳👍
I assume marvel games are what Marvel has been putting its money into instead of the movies and im actually ok with this
Look that storm 😮
RIP MVC4
Finalmente un buen juego de súper héroes, superar a Injustice no va a ser muy difícil
My boy robbiie is finally getting the spotlight he deserves…. Let’s go
This ain’t even the full roster and it’s already going hard
Iron man became a kamen rider
Anyone else tired of Asian stylization of American properties? They just look over designed.
No estará en Xbox 😢
It's Dragon Ball FighterZ in Marvel Form!
Would have prefered a MVC 5 with Street Fighter 6 style graphics.  That would have been way cooler.
Finally! A good My Hero Academia game! 💜
The game looks awesome and I'm really excited for it, but why on god's name can't we have a simple costume design for Spider-Man in these modern games man? It's always this unnecessary "paddings" and different colors contrasting his red and blue, it's not original, and most of the time it doesn't even look good. This one at least looks decent I guess
RIP 2XK0... you took 6 years to came out and well... never came out but made 6 characters.
Marvel said since u want to hangout with Snk🤔Capcom u have to sit this 1 out🤦🏾‍♂️🤯😢😅🥴🤣😭
Supaidaman returns!
I was going ape in a in n out parking lot watching this. Marvel lives!!!
Yo give me Goku DLC frfr
close enough, welcome back bbtag
finally, a good MVC
I just love it
This art is giving more love to the characters than actual artists over at their own company.
where's Akuma?
Max about to lose his goddamn mind
Next update: collaboration with Marvel Rivals.
Nice having this when rivals get too sweaty
This is my biggest dream come true! I have never been more excited. If this is just a tease of the roster, imagine what the full roster is going to be.
New major fighting game just dropped 😮
Marvel Fighter Z
As soon as i saw the arc systems logo...i knew this was gonna be fire.
I’m glad we finally got Robbie Reyes. He looks insane!
Hyped.
I just hope there is no magneto in this one, im sick of seeing that overrated character.
Oh My god, this s**t looks amazing...😮
Marvel fighters z
FINALLY Playstation W
YEEEEAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!
Marvel be like: Friendship ended with Capcom. Now Arc System Works is my new best friend.
ROBBIE REYES LETS GOOOOO
And XBOX????
The first fighting game done by Arc System Works that isn't a Japanese franchise.
The fantastic four better have some sorta special team super
This so tuff
Yes Marvel. BECOME THE ANIME/MANGA YOU WERE ALWAYS MEANT TO BE! I love these anime-ified redesigns. Iron Man looks straight out of a Super Sentai or mecha Gundam series and Storm looks SMOKING! Star Lord's pistols look like they took a book out of Lilo and Stitch weapon designs (bulbous, round, and sizable). Love that Robbie has been getting a lot of love lately as Ghost Rider. Also Kamala loook uber anime lol
The DLCs and the outfits are gonna be insane
Oh my god... i'm gonna cry... This looks AWESOME!!!
Looks super fun, will never play it. Guarantee it will become a sweaty nightmare where people practice TKOs nonstop in their basement.
I just can't believe it. Marvel by ArcSystemWorks. WE'RE SO BACK !
English I hope?
Thats Supadaiman ! I hope he can summon the megazord for ulti
Soooo happy to see Robbie Reyes in a game!! Hope this leads to him getting a toy soon!
Star lord is basically Dante lol
Marvel fighterZ
Someone really told 2XKO "double it and give it to the next person", and then Marvel merged that with Guilty Gear.
Need Cyclops!
NGL KINDA ANNOYING HOW THEY KEEP REMAKING THE SAME GAME OVER AND OVER JUST CASH GRABS
DONDE ESTA EL MARVEL VS CAPCOM 4 🥲🥹
Oh hell yeah, out 40-50 heroes and i can die happy
Ggs too many flying characters on the team! L game lol
First Rivals and now this! I’m on board
Parece bom ein! faz um x capcom 5 com esse grafico ai!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yall have no idea how much this means to me
We got a new Marvel vs Capcom game before GTA6 and I’m here for it.
flipante
Is that the Emissary from hell Supaiderman?
cadê a wandaaaaa
How odd. All products but comic books  are having the best time ever
I knew they were going make it look good arc system is amzing in art work and gameplay
FOOTDIVE 1:55
_X-Men: Children of the Atom, Marvel Superheroes,_ and now… _Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls_ !
Marvel vs capcom infinite ain’t work out marvel was like fine I’ll do it myself (thanos) 😂
I would've preferred 1v1 but I trust anything arcsys makes
I was excited for this game just to see it’s not gonna be on Xbox. I was already considering getting a steamdeck so I guess this might be another reason.
This is so peak
imagine Capcom unveiled a DC ve Capcom 😂 that's the kind of crazy world we're living in
I hope it also comes to ps4 in the future
*Why Marvel cant understand that we want AAA Games with recognized characters, imagine a Batman Arkham Night style game, with the Marvel Knights? Punisher, Daredevil, Moon Knight, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, etc*
If this is a 4 vs 4, there at least needs to be 20 plus base characters at launch
And with this 4 on 4 stuff imagine how big the rosters gonna be
Cap, Iron Man, and Star Lord all have their MCU dub actors returning.
What are they yapping about?
Close enough welcome back Marvel superheroes
Why is this on Japanese not complaining but only confused
Hyped.
Dammit! Here, here’s my money.
I'VE BEEN WANTING THIS FOR YEARS! Just Marvel (no Capcom) and by Arc System Works! I manifested this just like I did Dragon Ball FighterZ!😭❤️
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSS
Sick character designs!... they nailed it.
And a few years later all they would have to do is mix both rosters up add capcom characters with the little changes here and there overall and then boom! Full roster
Wowowowowow. It looks gorgeous. Just like how they made Dragon Ball FighterZ into something iconic.
2:06 "you can not hop in my car"
4v4 fighter from Arcsys? Marvel.. Sesame Street… who cares..
Hope this won't be a exclusive
Jesus Christ it’s INCREDIBLE!!! 😭😭😭
Marvel fans are eating GOOD
Perfect now add ryu, ken, akuma, Dante and Vergil and we can all be happy lol  All jokes aside looks good, it's been a while since we had a marvel fighting game.
Please bring this game to the Nintendo switch 2
I'm beyond ready. GIVE IT HERE!!!!!
THE BEST MARVEL GAME 2025/2026 ❤❤❤❤❤
First Marvel Rivals, then this?! Amazing
GG no heals
bro they're coming for every genre now wth
Oh my god! Fantastic! 😱😱❤💪😎  Next Magneto characters, Wolverine and Dark Phoenix.
Hell yes! Hoping for winter soldier 🙏
This is cool but we need some American badass voice overs.
I now want a new marvel anime series with all these characters +
So it's Dragonball fighterz with Marvel? Hell yea
Thats how you make a Super hero game westerners, thats the reason why you game industry are so dead right now.
2026!?!?!😭
Yes!!!!
Nevermind actually this could be a theory but what if they’re redoing the formula kinda like marvel super heros before marvel vs cap com or maybe do this game with a few x-men characters then do a sequel but an x-men fighting game , really letting thease games flesh themselves out without the “vs capcom “ for now
Rip Capcom.   Arc system has the crown now.
nen impact and now this???
Guilty Gear: Marvel
Why do I feel like a kid?
Give US a Japanese language option. I want to play just like this.
😲 absolutely
My two favorite fighters: guilty gear, and MvC. Seeing the devs of gg working on a marvel fighter gets me so hyped
Finally 😂Storm look normal girl with great thunder.. And that iron man. Wow
SHEESH,Marvel Tokon:Fighting Souls will be a smash hit until 2026!
Waiting for capcom vs capcom now
INSANE DC IN THE MUD!!!
Bro, where is Marvel Vs Capcom? They’re missing on some cash bro.
I gonna love playing this game.
kinda insane marvel vs capcom 4 wont be a capcom game
IM SO READY FOR THIS.  That said, DAMMIT WHY IS GGST WALL BREAK HERE
Peak
Imagine the mods, Dragon Ball vs Marvel
DBZ fighterZ style?
YYOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Gundam Iron Man in a fighting game was not on my 2025 bingo card
League of Legends fighting game is SCREWED
gameplay wise, the only audience this is going to appeal to is Street Fighter fans and they already have Marvel vs Capcom so I don't see any point in this, I guess Marvel is just trying its best to stay relevant and in people's minds
ITS MARVEL BABY🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
please please PLEASE add Hulk thats the only character i personally want 🙏
If only they put half as much effort into their films now. The games are popping off
My wallet is gonna be dead in 2026😭
So much for mvc ever coming back
Marvel and eastern studios really get along don't they Absolutely day 1 buy  Just you know...  No Vs Capcom 😔
Ahh I see what they’re doing
Gundam Ironman 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
Arc System Works you say? OK, I'm down.
Marvel Vs UCM
You know how loong I been waitin for dis (A new marvel fighting game on pc)? WOO IM BOUT TO MAKE A NAME FOR MYSELF RIGHT HERE
Pls daredevil in this one!!!
If I don't get juggernaut as a grappler I'm gonna be hella disappointed
Using Spider-Sense as a fighting game mechanic seems like such a no-brainer in retrospect.
Me: Marvels gets this and Rivals but DC can't even Keep Multiversus? this is so unfair  Also me: omg two cakes!!!
How do you say "Shut up and take my Money!" in Japanese? 😁
the star lord seiyuu is so familiar but i can't quite catch it SOMEONE HELP
I am very happy with the Robbie Reyes, Love
star-lord with an element gun that actually fires elements i'm so happy
Why does Ghost Rider sound like Diavolo
guilty gear gonna be DLC calling it now
@1:00 star lord “keepin it stylish!”
Arcsys really is the pinnacle of fighting games.  Roster already looks sick.
This looks peak asf
Marvel is really cooking with these games. Take some notes DC
Another L for XBox 😂😂
Let history repeat itself. Marvel vs. Capcom began with Marvel fighting games. Capcom just has to bite in the future.
i want marvel vs capcom but this will do
They just did the impossible... they made Ms. Marvel an actually appealing character.
These designs are soo sick
Today I Cry ! Thank you lord
OMG OMG OMG ARC SYSTEM WORKS YESSSS
Now we just need the vs Capcom
1million different types of these
Yeah it's Marvel, but I wanted MAHVEL
If you're going to tell me that a Marvel fighting game from Arc was on your bingo card, you are lying.
At first I was like "Oh, cool a Marvel  fighting game", then I saw Arc System Works and went "Yup, I'm definitely getting this!"
Everyone gangster until Doom pulls out the sidearm
Mortal Kombat: Marvel Edition.
Leaving the games to the East, this should be a trend
This isn’t marvel rivals?! 😮
I had my fingers crossed, I said please don’t say IOS and Android.
lame
I now want Spider-Man to yell out "SPIDEY SENSE!" whenever he's fighting to be the norm. Movies, Comics, TV, doesn't matter I want to hear it always.
English please
Another marvel fighting game?! HECK YEA!!
gwen stacy fantastic 4 omega red black heart cable daredevil kittie pride kingpin bullseye sandman blade hela loki yandu
Es una locura el juegoooooooooooooo
They abandoned capcom?!😮
Arc system doing a marvel fighting game? dam RIP CAPCOM
*_LET'S THROW IT DOWN, ANIME STYLE!!!_*
The design for spiderman and storm are impressive
I love the super sentai/Viewtiful Joe feel of this whole game
IT'S MAHVEL BABY !!!!
PLAYSTATION STUDIOS
MAKE WAY FOR THE EMMISARY OF HELL HIMSELF! But also this game looks fun to play
RIP Marvel vs Capcom.
Please make Taskmaster cool. Please make Taskmaster cool! 🙏
I see why dnf Dual died. lol
kinda bummed this is not on Xbox, but still very cool congrats ASW on this
The next Injustice game looks strange
The game is not mind blowing because no Capcom side but it looks goods
Now this is amazing 👏👏
Marvel fighterz
I hope this can be a hit like Rivals
This looks amazing!!!
Dammit, video games, you can't keep giving me all these hot Storm designs
Marvel vs Capcom without the Capcom
2026 is a big year for gaming. Just have to survive..
I need to see Cyclops and Daredevil, where are my boys
56 minutes
I hope there are gonna be mcu skins because i don't like so much the anime style, i waited the mvc3 design, but it's nice
Yessssss! Marvel is COOKING with this one! And it’s an Arc Systems game?! Let’s gooooo!!!!
Okay. Okay. Okay! Marvel you cooked with this one! 😈👏🔥
what a time to be a MARVEL fan
Marvel gaming has been on a generational run these last few years and they just keep going 😭🔥 this looks insane
IT'S MAHVEL, BABY!!!
Looks like Capcom dropped the ball and i am not mad
They better add Juggernaut who is iconic in Marvel vs Capcom Fighting Collection games and ever present in Deadpool movies.
I seriously hope there is a better character selection besides the MCU. I know Storm and Ghost Rider are there, but the rest are so over done and boring, and I like Cap and Doom.
the VA is out of this world
A MARVEL GAME THAT I AM ACTUALLY EXCITED FOR!?
Ghost Rider Robbie Reyessss
So basically it’s fighterz but marvel
I am more interested in the number of people refunding this game when THE WAZZLER had this game on his hands..🤣🤣🤣
This was the marvel fighting game as i wanted all my life
Daumm Storm got Chun Li body mold okay Im in finally something for us fighting game player and please make it PC as well thank you
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY literally
I am in a dream,unbelievable,a arcs marvel game? WOW
I love it! I don't want to play it... But I love it.
Whats this
insane
This looks so peak
When they said "working with a partner" I thought I was about to explode. Then I saw ASW and fing fell asleep.
Is it gonna have a single player or arcade mode?
My wish came true..
THANK YOU !!!
So it's DBFZ with a Marvel skin mod? That they'll sell for $80 and people will buy it because it's Marvel? I have to applaud the audacity
Marvel was not on my bingo card for whatever game arc system was working on next but I’m glad it is.
Somewhere in Capcom: *chewing the very pencils while seething in anger*
ARC SYS WERE SOOOOOO BACK!!!!!!!!!!
Este Spider-man se ve como el de rivals al parecer ese diseño también pego fuerte.
Did they beat out Capcom in fighting Marvel characters?!
So a purely Marvel FG, whens the last time we had that, Marvel Super Heros?
Is this not just Marvel’s version of FighterZ with a 4v4 mode or am I missing something?
Wolverine didn't show up cause bub been busy in sony insomniac
The impact that rivals has had on marvel games is fantastic
Kamala Plant
wish it wasn't arcsys but i'll take it
Arc? Thats all i needed to know
It looks so good.🤩🤩🤩
This looks insane The ultimate way to make a fighting game  Absolutely smashed it!
Marvel's Injustice
Looks very Guilty Gear!
Alright im buying it... but because Starlord's finally in a fighting game.
Marvel v.s Ca... Marvel  Neat
Marvel SUPERHEROES for the modern day. Love it.
4xko community in shambles!
Interesting
This is Marvel VS Marvel 4. The Marvel VS Capcom 3 Version.
This is how you do it!!!
You got the right team making this one! Bravo
Bro this look fire!!
Rip mvc4  Still looks fire tho
Yes! More Marvel games!
Why not switch 2?
WE ARE SO BACK
MAHVEL IS BACK BAYBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
2:12 Isn't this design from Deadpool: Samurai?
They said capcom was taking to long for a Marvel vs game 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is nothing but a Marvel versus Capcom substitute
Doctor Doom did the spirit gun from yu yu hakusho
love it cant wait hopefully we get silver surfer
WHERES THE FOOT DIVE
Yo!!!!!!!!!!!!! Finally can get excited for something Marvel
Arc System Works surprised me this is obviously going to be a good fighting game and BBTAG is awesome!!! 💙❤️💛💜
HOLY GAS
Hollyyyyy, bout to drop a reaction in a bit lol
Shanga la frontier
Just give the Marvel IP license in gaming to the east. Give them the Marvel IP for animation as well. Just let them cook, because whether it's china or Japan, the east is cooking with the Marvel IP, doing things the west hasn't been able to do at all.
marvel dropped the ball not working with capcom
Another fire Marvel game
I’m still waiting on Marvel vs DC
Fire whoever said, “let’s not put this on Xbox”
So....Marvel Superheroes 2?  I'm not complaining, though. Looks gorgeous.
Is this game similar to marvel vs Capcom
GONNA TAKE YOU FOR A RIDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nice! I hope it will be in PS4.  Also, I’d love to have the following in the roster and have them as my team…  1. Jean Grey/Phoenix/Dark Phoenix  2. Madelyne Pryor/Goblin Queen 3. Mystique (Morphed as Jean Grey.) 4. Morph (Morphed as Jean Grey.)
2XKO DEAD ON ARRIVAL  GOT THE OVERWATCH TREATMENT
As a strategist main from Rivals seeing Spider-Man get beat up like that makes me so happy 10/10 trailer
can't wait for the flop
Imagine these skins in Marvel Rivals and vice versa 👀👌
I love this.
"The name's Star Lord, remember it" "The name's Gambit, try not to forget it"
What MCOC wished they could’ve been
Marvel FighterZ‼️‼️
Marvel vs capcom 4???????????????????
This battle is about to explode
Marvel really got  the 2XKO hype timing
Choose your hero or villain! Im not judging!
I honestly love the art style, the game looks chaotic and fun and I'm here for that 🙂‍↔️
Looks like Dragonball
Where the F is the Fantastic Four? 😭😭
It’s nice to finally get a marvel-only fighting game
Why no healer and tank?
So remember whenever Capcom releases a "new" fighting game collection from yesteryears, a new one is on the horizon..  Welcome to Tek.. TOKON 🤣
Marvel: 😴😴😴 Marvel, Japan: 🤯🤯🤯
Dos that mean capcon vs marvel dead
Wait.. is this the dream come true? 😭
arc systems making a new marvel LETS FING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dbfz players gonna have some fun with this
beta access?
4v4 is Crazy!! Mahvel vs Mahvel!!
This what marvel vs capcom infinite should have been
What’s with all the amazing Marvel games being announced recently  (Not complaining by the way)
It's MARVEL BABY!!!!!!!
2xko is dead
Miyuki Sawashiro as Storm? You have my attention.
Instant classic ??!
Arcsys cucked Capcom again, this time with their ex.
???????? GAS
Finally, a reason for me to get into fighting games.
this game is insane
"You know what would be cool? A marvel fighting game by ArcSys" me 10 years ago  It's crazy that this is actually happening 🤩
Mango sentinel or we riot
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
GHOST RIDERRRRRRR
4v4, 8 characters on screen  Tai Lung: The lag will be Legendary
Why the only game that makes "comic acurate" skins is fornite? Every Marvel game is made with incredibly ugly suits.
we are SO BACK
Mahvel's BACK! can't wait for Maximilian dood to react to this! 🔥🔥🔥
add scarlet witch and my life is yours
well at least it looks less mcu finally i can enjoy being captain america, spiderman or war machine without being a stupid hollywood baby rotten  face
I wish I was a fighting game player I’m not gonna be able to do a combo to save my life
That kinda sucks. I would have loved to see an Injustice style fighting game for Marvel.
Marvel 4(v4) is finally here! YAY~
Finally, the fighting game we've been asking for since MvC2
Had to do a double take when I heard captain America speaking Japanese lol but thus looks cool
A Marvel Guilty Gear strive ? This shouldn’t be bad
Me: Sees two of the Big Three. Brain: Where Thor
Dude. Marvel zombies... Marvel what ifs.... Bring them. GIVE US CYCLOPS!!!
Is this a Sony exclusive?
Starlord ⭐♥️
How much for Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Beast and Cyclops? I only want to now... ajjaj
After Marvel vs Capcom infinite.  we are all in tears right now🤣🤣🤣 LETS....GO!!!!!!🎉🎉
Is it only in Japanese ?
This game is going to be F***ing SICK!!💯👀😩🙌👍
so its just mortal kombat as marvel in japanese
It so shame DC not moving doing a good games anymore I wish I cam see superman game
1 v (1-4) or (1-4) v (1-4) I hope is an option
I’m worried about the roster size. Hopefully it’s not like Dragon Ball Fighter Z’s roster size
Yayayayayayaya Holy I am so Hyped!!!!!!!!
Rip Marvel vs Capcom
Why didnt they use Supaidaman?
Awesome! I hope there's like a Story Mode to this game once it's released.
*my guess is the roster will be:*  1.) Already Guest: Captain America; Ironman; Ms. Marvel; Spiderman; Ghost Rider; Star-lord; Doctor Doom.  possibility 🤔: Thor; Hulk; Venom; Hawkeye; Moon Knight; Cyclops; Gambit; Doctor Strange; Wolverine; Deadpool; Rocket Racoon; Miles Morales; Winter Soldier; Dormammu; Fantastic Four; Magneto; Gargantos; Nova; Black Widow; and Taskmaster. Right??
It’s Mahvel BABY!
you pick 4 characters? yea this definitely bouta have autocombos
Please make one of Spider-Man's Hyper be of Japanese Spider-man lol
Personally not a fan of street fighter esque game but this looks kinda fun and storm is so badddddd😩
Yk what this goes hard
Arc Sys: "Fine! If Capcom won't make a Marvel vs. Capcom sequel, we will!"
ARCSYS INCLUDE NOVA THE HUMAN ROCKET IN YOUR FIGHTING GAME AND MY LIFE IS YOURS
This pure insanity!! This is Marvel without Capcom!! This is beautiful!!
Reminds me of capcom vs marvel, i love it
SIIIIIIII
Is that goddamn Sawashiro Miyuki voicing Storm?!
ASIA CARRIES AMERICAN MADE FRANCHISE SO HARD . WHAT A COMEDY 😂😂😂
Is Storm my new waifu? Yeah, no more questions.
Imagine capcom characters as crossover dlc
marvel vs capcom

Yes🔥
Please give me Ultron in this baby
about time we had a solo marvel "2d" fighting game that was well done, this is amazing
Wolverine?
That’s right
... Wha?  (I'm here for it, tho)
Better be Dubbed in english with the most popular VA's for the characters. It's freaking marvel. Unacceptable if it isn't.
Guilty Gear Marvel Marvel Gear guilty- you get the point
oh no... Maximilian dood is gonna coom...
Storm: stone free, i mean storm attacks
Why not on Xbox??
heres a prayer that the balance patches arent completely dumb like every other balance patch for the last decade from them...
Don’t know how I feel about this many recycled dbfz animations.
THE RDC STREAMS WILL BE LEGENDARY
TE APENDEJASTE BIEN FEO CAPCOM
Marvel Games cooking right now holyyyy  Magneto when
Dragon Ball FighterZ Who??
Siiiiiick
Much better pick than Capcom as the dev team. Great call from Playstation.
0:40 SUPER SKRULL CONFIRMED
Makes me wonder how Disney gave Arc their approval to do this.
What's this storm design?  It looks so cool
Marvel in Films Right Now:😐 Marvel in Games:🤘🔥
Red coat Star-Lord, boooooooo
Okay so sony could have just made/backed up a fighting game at anytime, huh.      Hoping this game doing well will convince them on making a new PS All Stars game in the same style as this lol anyway, love how star lord and ms marvel are in this game considering they were originally planned for MvC:I.
no xbox?
of course the character nobody cares about is forced into this
Dang Mr fantastic benched for ms marvel for stretchy fists. Still looks pretty good. Glad to see Gundam man.
Marvel knew that they could not change society so instad of reflecting on themselves, they blamed The Thing. Asgard or Hel. Rouns 1. Let´s Rock!
An emissary from hell... SUPAIDAMAN
They gave Tony a Gundam like suit!
When you immediately hear Miyuki Sawashiro's voice
Whens. Mahvel
Gundam style Iron Man needs to make more appearances in my opinion.
Can we get Slapstick, Power Pack, and Darkhawk on the game
Guh
0:58 Just like Dante in MVC3 I love it already.
We may not have gotten the sequel for Marvel Vs Capcom but dammit I'll take what I can get
Where is Capcom?? =P
Wow. This makes MvsC Infinite look like a tech demo 😂. Marvel is deff cooking in the video game side this year!
Why not for xbox😢😢😢😢😢
I just need venom
Ngl, when Doom pulled up i squealed like a giddy schoolgirl.
why does Iron Man have a V-Fin? He's a Gundam now?! 😅
Matana baby
This is going to be so cold I knew right when I seen Arc systems fighters vibes right here
IM GONNA TAKE YOU FOR A RIDE
Ik Dc Fuming lol
Breaks my heart I can't play this on Xbox
Welcome back Dragon Ball FighterZ
Marvel Gear: StriveRd
No wayy yall left thor and hulk out
AN ARC SYS MARVEL GAME?!
God I love Marvel
Yo what is this Storm design? Looks great.
Finalmente senhores, não é da Capcom mas parece ótimo 👍
The avreage quick play expérience with no healers
Vengador Fantasma! Siiiiiiiiuuuuu
arcsys??? no way. this is going to be good for sure.
RELEASE ON SWITCH 2 NOW
This, THIS is what Marvel deserves. Endless possibilities for the roster too. Bless you, Arc System Works. :')
I hope its a technical fighter
You’re telling me the creators of my favorite fighting game Dragon Ball FighterZ is making a Marvel game??? Take my money
Arcsys made this?
Looks craazyyy can't wait to play this
Xbox ?
I was tweaking out when this was revealed it looks absolutely incredible and you can tell that so much passion was put into it.
DRAGONBALL AVENGERZ!!!
Capcom sitting on their hands. Whatever. Arcsys got this
How did arcsys of all studios drop the ball so hard......................
@lythero you need to get on this when it drops
Developers waited until the MCU was dead before they started releasing GOOD Marvel games. Why?
Finaly! We can fight our Marvel riv... oh, sorry
POR FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN
Wait, we got another marvel game? In this economy?
Holy crap, this looks incredible!!!
This surprised the hell out of me!
Hell yeah. English dub it then get back to us.
a marvel 4v4 fighting game!? I was not expecting that today! this looks awesome!
close enough... welcome back Marvel vs Capcom
Marvel starting cooking as soon as they dropped rivals I see 😂
Please keep adding characters free without silly season passes and stuff!
my word,they are qoing all-out on the marvel games lately
Awesome!
This looks incredible! The movement looks so smooth 😎. Can't wait to play this! Will it be free to play like Marvel Rivals though...?
It's over gng we legit got a Marvel fighting game made by the Guilty Gear devs before gta 6
bill clinton would be proud
This is epic😊
Peni parker would be perfect in this game
Can somebody check on Maximilian right now
Where have you been all my life!
The game looks amazing! , but I will miss marvel vs capcom 😞😞
Okay, now this looks exciting and fun. I hope they have Black Panther and Iceman aswell😅
You had me at Kamala Khan. I need a PS5 now :T
Solely Marvel fighting game? Yeah I’m down Also 4v4 is crazy bro
Wolverine??????
I need to see Yipes' first reaction to this video
If they can pull off a Dr. Strange I might consider it
Helll yeah this is the game I want
Guilty Gear with Marvel mods!!!!
Pls no modern controls
Right now WB games just silently cancelled the teen titans live service
BRING BACK MARVEL NEMISIS!
Marvel: “Fine. I’ll do it myself…”  MVC: *dies*
Cállate y toma mi dinero!!!😂❤
YEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS
Whens Marvel?
FABULOSO, ACHEI INCRÍVEL MESMO!!!
Gracias Arc Systems por todo y perdon por tan poco
2026 when rivals fatigue hits, another drug marvel game shall follow. Lezgooooo
Now, let's hope this is an Evo worthy game
The Final Roster on this game is going to be INSANE
no way they actually made 4v4 a thing let's gooooo
Yes!!
we're getting this before 2XKO😂
DOOM Aura Walking i CANT 🥶🥶🥶
1:21 for his level 1 he wields a gun
anything except a new MvC game
Marvel: Fighter Z
taskmaster please
Having to turn on closed captions for a Marvel IP trailer was a shock
Finally some good food
a Marvel fighting game was on my bingo card but never expected to be from arc systems.
Let’s be real Japan is the best at making fighting games so it’s hype hearing Japanese when the trailer starts
RIP 2xko and nen impact
So it’s like dragon ball fighterz
Starting to feel like Japan has a infatuation with marvel
nahh DC is officially cooked after this one
These designs look great!  I was just playing the Marvel vs Capcom Collection and Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 today, too!
Storm looks interesting and better than we've had recently with her long hair and as it should be, I wish the comics would take note and stop inventing so much nonsense.  My only problem is seeing that keep forcing Kamala and that didn't use the most important Ghost Rider but the new one, that makes me see that it's something influenced by the MCU I hope that is not going to limit much which characters are chosen.
Can't wait to dragon install Dr. Doom
I swear if this is a mobile game I will quit playing video games until the industry comes to its senses.
Capcom: "I THOUGHT WE HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL!!!"
Wowza a marvel game made from the guilty gear devs
Guilty Marvel
this looks awesome
There are definitely quite a few MHA VA's in this, they sound so familiar. if anyone knows please share!
if this games structure isnt for some reason held up by goku. then I don't want it lol
Marvel Minus Capcom
I kept waiting for Ragna The Blood Edge
Robbie Reyes?! Nice seeing him.
Day one Arc System works❤
DC had decent modern fighting game, Marvel is finally getting one as well(crossovers don’t count).
Of course they put overhyped and overexposed Miss Marvel in the game but you know what they got my girl Storm in this game and all I need now is the Scarlet Witch and they can put whoever they want in this game.
It would be more peak if it was Marvel vs Capcom.
tell me dr doom has a divekick and ill officially unretire from fighting games
Que tan muerto está el ucm que finalmente decidieron que el próximo juego de lucha de Marvel se desligara de el, que bueno PD:odio que parezca que a Marvel solo le va bien cuando lo tocan los asiáticos, detesto el estilo anime en los superhéroes,pero parece que no queda otra, occidente está senil en estos momentos
That's not Storm 😂😂
Ohhhh
Ryu as a guest character?
Marvel vs Capcom sem Capcom
So we're getting A Marvel Game inspired by Their Anime Projects and Mangaverse? I'm in!!!!😎😎😎😎 You know they might bring back Marvel Anime Shows and since Sony was handling that, I feel more optimistic about them getting us Fans pure cinema.
AMAZING
The FGC has been asking for an Arc System Works Marvel fighting game for years. Glad they were actually listening. The game looks sick!!!!
el exito de marvel es dejarle todo a los chinos :v
Oh yeah I'm definitely buying this and i need that storm costume in rivals 😂 also i hope they add rogue i would have her and doom on my team so fast
They need Deadpool voiced by Dio’s VA in this game
If they can do this without the usual microtransaction/gatcha bullcrap, then kudos!
Xbox players right now 😭
THEY GOT ROBBIE ON BASE ROSTER!!!!!
looks like fantasy fight lol so slow
I love how impractical it is to have Spider-Man yell "SPIDEY SENSE" before attacking
Take my money
Knowing Arc Systems' track record with fighting games, I know this is going to be good.
Finally a Marvel Superheroes sequel
I'm all in on Tokusatsu Iron Man but he needs a scarf
Its.....beautiful 😭
It may not be MVC.... But this definitely feels like Mahvel!
The way I screamed when I saw this during the State of Play was wild. Bless whoever first proposed this collaboration and all the higher-ups who allowed it to happen. What a great day.
Doom with the coldest quick draw in a fighter ive ever seen
So it's like dragon ball fighters ok this looks fun
Really hope this doesn’t end up like multiversus where it died after 2 days
can wait to mod capcom characters into this
We're getting a Japanese Marvel vs. Marvel before GTA 6 (maybe)
I... This is just amazing. Truly, truly amazing.
marvel vs capcom 5 but no capcom
poor xbox man
Marvel, no...............  Didn't ask for a MarvelFighterZ
Spaidy... Sense!!!
Starlord looks just like dante, hype!
Doom tiene una vibraba a Bison😅
Holy F ...
🙏
Hoping for the og eva Peni Parker to appear as DLC
Pretty cool. Kinda disappointing at the same time because I expected a Marvel Super Heroes reboot from capcom, the Re Engine in all its glory, etc.. but anyway, it is what it is. And Marvel yet again trying to force Ms Marvel down on our throats, that will never work, why not give the spotlight to Rogue or Jean Grey (not Phoenix, this entity already had enough highlights through the years)
Bro tag fighters are making a comeback first 2XKO, Hunter Hunter , now this! All we missing is a new DC fighting game
as an xbox player i’m crying rn
First marvel was killing it in the box office now they are killing it with the video games
Why didn’t Marvel Vs Capcom 3 had Japanese voices for the Marvel characters? A missed opportunity I’m sure these guys will have English voices soon Not on Xbox?  What a waste
AMAZING!!!!
where is dmc dante?
Who else do you want in Marvel Tōkon?
"There is only Doom"
We got marvel tokon after marvel rivals 🎉
nice game
I just know ARC is aware of the the mistakes CAPCOM made 8 years ago with MVCI. The roaster, the double tag, the graphics(which okay to me) The DLC’s even down to them messing up Chung-lees face in the beginning sheesh them showing storm alone was enough for me!!ARC PLEASE DON’T FUMBLE THIS!
please, somebody pay me a ticket to japan
Good grief, how many characters are they going to have? That's an entire Street Fighter II playable roster per match.
I see Ms. Marvel.... Insta-buy!
Im not gonna lie. The Japanese VA threw me off. But the gameplay just looks so fire that I am willing to ignore it. This game looks so good.
Nice, a new Marvel fighting game because Capcom wouldn't make one
0:28 Gundam Ironman
Marvel with no Capcom MnC!
we can kiss marvel vs capcom 4 goodbye, there is no chance in hell marvel will license 2 fighting games at same time. may be we can expect marvel vs guilty gear 1, Capcom did sneak Akuma in Children of atom.
2xko is wearing now that they didn’t move faster
Gundamu-Aiaman
This looks marvelous.
ore wa supiedaman da!!!!
Good god, what are these character designs?
Lisa: "Marvel 4 is here!"  Homer and Marge: _Shocked._  Bart: "Yeah, that's right. Marvel 4v4 made by Arc System Works!"
Pretty crappy, huh? Throwing Iron Man and the same overused characters into different genres? So exciting! All that's missing is a roguelike starring Iron Man, a card game where Doctor Strange is an ultra-rare.  Marvel FighterZ — how creative 😱🗣️
marvel rivals best
how did you get arc sys to make a pact with you to do this
We don't have Mahvel, but we have Maveru. And 4v4? We need the F4 please!
ts gonna flop so hard
RIP Marvel vs Capcom 😂
Hey, they actually have the X-Men this time!
*EXCELSIOR* 😎     Wait, what is “Tokon” or even mean exactly? 🤨
The Marvel vs. Capcom game we always wanted, made without Capcom. Arc System Works deserved it, this looks incredible.
this is Marvel FighterZ lol
SUPAIDAMAN!!!! THEY PUT SUPAIDAMAN IN HERE!!!!!!
IT’S MARVEL BABY!!!!!!
Loki did his best to fix our timeline, by giving us ArcSys Mahvel
doom better have footdive or im swinging
Marvel King of Fighters! Let’s go!
Remove miss marvel put mr fantastic and we have a good game
ima pass i can feel the sweats hyped to try hard all day
Starlord and Ghost Rider look amazing.
Will Sunfire, or Silver Samurai be coming too?
Do its Pc and Ps5 Only?? Thats unfortunate honestly
STORM ⛈️
Give me the haus of magnus!
Guilty Gear Marvel? We're in trouble
MvC4 de-confirmed.  Finally, Marvel is starting to know their value.  👍 ArcSys proved themselves with DBFZ, so I trust this game will be pretty good.  4v4 will be crazy!!!  🤯
Foot da foot dive let's gooo
I say let... them... COOK
Ayo we got mvc back ..... oh wait lol very cool
2:02 Is this a Jojo reference?
im going to have a heart attack
I don't like it 🙁🙁 I love it😍😍❤️❤️
Add Deadpool and I’ll buy
Marvel Vs No capcom
Hold up. Was that Miyuki sawashiro voicing Storm???
everything perfect about this game can't wait.
Marvel is cooking
Wack
Something tells me these matches will be... Pure Chaos
Wait a minute, Storm has Milla Maxwell jp VA?
WHAT!!  No way!!!  This better have English voiceovers.
New marvel rivals limited time mode just dropped 🎉
wow i like this gameplay
Looks good. Hopefully it comes to Switch 2 and Xbox as well
No Foot dive?
MARVEL COME ON LET US BREATHE BECAUSE THIS IS HYYYYPE
Where’s Blade???
ARC SYSTEM MARVEL GAME????? LEZ GOOOOOOOOOO
Dc crying in the corner mortal kombat as well.
So excited for this. Loved DBFZ, marvel is in good hands with Arc.
Finally the vs we deserved! Well done Arc. Too bad Capcom!
omg! this reminds me of marvel vs capcom, so nostalgic
When I wish for Marvel 4....I didn't expect a Marvel vs Marvel 4 vs 4
So marvel just out here dropping trailers like this without warning!!!
We're so back
This looks awesome!
PlayStation said while you wait for Marvel vs. Capcom 4 why don’y you try this 😅😂🤣
Meanwhile, DC's stuck in the WB/Netherrealm gulag.
I’m already getting nam flashbacks to Fighter Z. And i will be ready for this
Had a feeling they might be given the reins.
We got Marvel vs. Marvel before Capcom vs. Capcom.   Massive ball drop on Capcom's part.
storm, kamala AND robbie reyes? oh im eating good
It looks cool, but the 4v4 gameplay sounds and looks like an unbearable mess ngl. Let's see how Arc System Works deals with that.
No way is arc systems, the people who made my favorite fighting game of all time: Dragonball fighterz, is now making a marvel fighting game. It’s come full circle now 😮🔥🔥
LET Neatherrealm make a Marvel fighting Game.Its been Ed Boon Dream for years.
The Japanese voices are ridiculous. 😂😂😂
IT'S MAHVEL BABY!
INSANE BRO I WANNA KNOW THE DRAMA BEHIND THIS EXISTING
Man the character designs are so respectful to the source material, but with the Japanese twist is.. perfect.
this is sad, I'm not gonna lie, growing with the marvel vs capcom series to now have "only marvel" fighting game that isn't even made by capcom means that at least in the next 10 years we won't have a new marvel vs capcom game. Also made by the same company that makes the most boring fighting games. Yes, the visual of arc system works are one of the bests in the industry, but the mechanics of their games are not of my enjoyment. I really wished for a marvel vs capcom game that looked like arc system work game, but a marvel only game with the avengers roster... is a slap in the face. look cool but is not okay
Is this Team Neo Blood? I feel like their style is coming through and that's why it feels both brand new and familar.
Cmon…     You gotta admit this is cool! 🔥
OMG Kanala
Had me at Arc Sys Works
I can't wait for Spidey to be mid to bottom tier.
Peak
This is how game ment to be made
PLEASE GIVE SPIDER-MAN WALLRUN COMBOS!! This is super exciting. Idk what this means for Marvel vs Capcom, but I'm hyped.
What makes this better is the Japanese
ARCSYS SAVE US
It seems that this game isn’t using the usual ArcSys animation style, going with something a bit more fluid.
I can't believe they made Kamala Khan exhude more personality and charm than anything Marvel proper has done
Can't wait for maximilian dood  to react to this.
Never liked Arc Sys fighters. But this might be the closest we ever get to MvC4
Marvels back baby
BRUH!!!! THIS IS SIIICK!!!!!
Damm rip not on xbox 😭
Yet again the Asian developers know what we want!!! Take my money!!
It’s by the same people that made Guilty Gear and Dragon Ball Fighterz
I don’t care what the street fighter and tekken rejects say. I am legitimately excited for this game. It looks amazing ❤❤❤
which character is gonna potemkin buster
MUSIC: 10/10 DESIGN: 10/10 ART: 10/10 STORM: 8==========D/10
Ehh close enough, welcome back Marvel vs Capcom.
The only hype of this rather lack luster State of Play, no need for PS5 Pro cause it ain't worth it and have to buy disc drive sas an optional.   PS5 Slim is just majority PS4 games and few PS5 games at this point.
Is that PS4 Spiderman?
Japanese Spider-Man is back
I didn't know all I needed was the characters to be voiced in Japanese lol. Looks great.
ITS MAHVEL BAYBEE! IM SO HYPE!
I would have preferred something like Injustice, Civil War or something like that, but this still works for me.
For the love of God please scale back all this hit stun and screen freeze on this. 😢
We need fottdive
GIVE IT TO ME
Rivals came out and what a game and still is amazing and than marvel vs capcom 2 came back, and now this like marvel has sucked at dominating the gaming market unlike dc but now they finally stepped up and now they dominating like finally marvel is dominating here
*THIS IS LITERALLY DRAGONBALL FIGHTERZ!*
Marvel fighters Z
Eyo its Guilty Gear Marvel
MARVEL TŌKON: FIGHTING SOULS MARVEL COSMIC INVASION  MARVEL RIVALS  WE WON!!!!!
This is GREAT. Still want a Marvel vs Capcom vs SNK though 😭
I don't think we're gotten a real Marvel fighting game in ages. Looking forward to this one.😃
This is your response to injustice? Meh…
HARD GAME BROOOOOO
A fighterz style marvel game, fk yeah
😐 no mvc 😑 😕No marvel vs arc system 🫤
WOW!
My favorite part of this trailer... no Deadpool.
This is the most exceptional looking fighting game I've ever seen.
Need the full roster Asap
Soooo peak
Between this and Marvel Rivals, it seems like Asian countries understands Marvel more than Marvel themselves.  And like the top-rated comment mentioned before: Marvel vs. Marvel.
Zoo wee mama 😭🙏🏻
Not a big fan of Iron Man's look though there'll probably be a more traditional costume, and Robbie Reyes instead of Johnny is ehhhhh but otherwise it looks promising.
looks really good, I'm glad that it have only marvel characters (without capcom)
Marvel vs capcom, hold the capcom
Finally a better version of Marvel Champions
You better put the english and japanese voices in the u.S release.
ARC SYSTEM WORKS WHAAAT!!!!
Future Marvel Rivals collab please! these characters and art style looks so cool!
Its Mahvel Baby!
I LOVE how Ironman looks in this!
HYPE
Literally nobody is asking for Ms Marvel, why do they keep trying to push this character
THE DROUGHT IS OVER FINALLYYYYY
Give me Jeff and I'd buy it day 1 xD
I AM ABOUT TO 💧
Mortal kombat but marvel? Take my money rn
RIP xbox boys 😂😂
🎮
Maximillian was LITERALLY JSUT talking about the fact that a 4v4 tag game would be crazy!
Yes
0:47 Spider man literally yells SPIDEY SENSE like it’s his stand ability
🏏⚾🔥🏟
Yeah
How much longer until Groot and Bridget shake hands?
Should've been Marvel vs DC fighting game fr
Marvel FighterZ Injustice.
Holy crap, we actually made it. My fighting spirit is restored  Edit: thank god. Thank you. Thank you!
Ahem... "THAT'S MARVEL BABY!"
Pre-order when?
Arc system works involved? Peak fighting game incoming
Marvel Games recently: MONEY PRINTER GO BRRRRRRRRR
Will it come to xbox? We need more good tag fighters
YES YES YES!!! FINALLY
Riot could have this... 10 years ago!  RIP 2xko
Arc system lets go!
Marvel and 2d fighting games don't go along
arcsys making the game tells me the online matchmaking and connection is going to be unplayable for a few years
I loved that they team up with ARC System works
more marvel slop
Ngl I actually prefer this. More chances for my fav comic characters to make an appearance
Super MVC fan! Not certain what to think of this yet, but looks promising.
Amazing❤💙💚
0:31 Dazzler performing in the theatre, stickers on lamppost looks like could be spiderman OR deadpool? "NO MORE MUTANTS" (Scarlet Witch) in grafitti. "Arkon the Musical!" advertised on Taxicab The building on the right side belongs to Janet van Dyne aka The Wasp, James Jonah Jameson on a big screen behind them. Avengers Tower and the Baxter Building (Fantastic 4) in the background. Posters saying "Norman Osborn for President!" on the building when Ms Marvel gets knocked off stage   0:54 Thor statue with captain america and iron man with their retro designs, a broken down rusted Shield Helicarrier above them?  1:13 Fogwell's Gym on the right street corner, Nelson and Murdock's on the opposite corner - This is Hells Kitchen, it even looks like that might be Matt Murdock in the window of the left building maybe? Giant tentacles draped over the building - Shuma Gorath?  So many references in the backgrounds I love it!
I haven't played Marvel Rivals yet, but I assume this kind of teamwork is what people dream of! Finally. You can carry your whole team by yourself! It looks like DNF Duel crawled so MARVEL TOKON could Instant airdash overhead into team assist cross-up.   This is EVERYTHING I wanted. Then, we get a Marvel vs GGST. I am crying rn. Thank you to every single person who makes this possible, from the whole of my heart.
MVM let's go
Give the rights back to Capcom.
I hear Nakamura Yuichi as Cap!  Maybe they'll be consistent with the seiyuu in the JMCU!
GGs 2xKO. We never knew you....
PlayStation gatekeeping heat
Can we defund the MCU and just put more money towards games that focus on what make marvel cool like this and Rivals please?
Marvel FighterZ
Gundam man or Iron Gundam ?
I was NOT ready for this
But where is magneto?
Now we only need Injustice 3
Marvel future Avengers vibes
Amazing!
Marvel Vs Capcom 4 please ! WHEN ??????
DID DR DOOM JUST PULL A STRAP OUT ON FUGGIN GHOST RIDER??!
Who needs fighterz 2 i guess
hope it wont come out with a region lock. looks fire
4v4 is excessive
That's what I'm talking about babyyy!!! Let's goooooooo!!!!
Give now
RIP MvC.
🔥🔥🔥
WE ARE SO BACK
can’t wait for 5v5 in MarvelvsTokon2
The goat has arrived
Now we know why there is no Fighterz 2
MORE LIKE THIS MARVEL. LET PEOPLE USE YOUR IP.
Arc System making a Marvel fighting game? I think I'm gonna this is the best news I've got all year
Well done 🙂
Please show daredevil love
aaaaaaand its not on steam
japan marvel
I haven’t been they hyped about something in a very long time
AYEEEEE
Scott Porter you better be on this project if it’s dubbed
The FGC community is eating well this year
Dragon ball fighter z of marvel.........epic
Howard the Duck or riot!
WHERE IS MORRIGAN, RYU, AND DANTE?!?!
So the title for the game is... Fighting Souls Fighting Souls... do you want some coffee coffee.
"Orewa Grooto"
Dude, I’m so glad they added Miss Marvel
Bro. This has alot of nostalgia to it. It's reminding me of X-Men Mutant Academy 2
Disney Marvel finally doing it right.
Oh boy... Arc System Works. Now I can play a Marvel fighting game where the cpu cheats non-stop and does things that are impossible for any player to do.
W
Hell yea
This gaming streak... Gunn should end himself I fear.
Can we appreciate how Doom gets bodied by the only person he recognizes as his equal: Storm ⛈️
1:25   Doom said: MAGNUM
This....LOOKS FIRE!!! I'M GOING CRAZY ON HOW IRON MAN AND CAPTAIN AMERICA LOOKS!!!!
THE HYPE IS REAL!!!  BASICALLY MARVEL SUPERHEROES 2, LET'S GET IT!!
RIP Marvel vs Capcom gone but never forgotten
ITSU MAHBERU BAYBEE ! 😭😭😭
I did not understand a word of that unfortunately
close enough welcome back mvc
ITS MAHVEL l baybee!!!!
Hold on everyone shut up Kamala Khan being mentioned without being asked truly a new age
Marvel without Capcom
I can already hear max going insane..... he's gotta be
Bro I screamed 😫WTFFF
Gonna main Spider-Man so freakin hard
Peak marvel, mcu take notes
daredevil gets his own portion of the map even with matt appearing in it but i hope DD is playable in game
YES MARVEL 4v4 I love it lets go!!!
This might be Marvel's Rival (sorry)
I WANT!!!
OMG!!!! the "marvel vs capcom" we wanted (even without capcom) LoL..... is back.... beautiful beautiful beautiful...and this audio in Japanese made it even better
DID I HEAR YUICHI NAKAMURA AS CAP AMERICA??????? HE SOUNDS SO GOOOD OMG Also can anyone say the rest of the vc cast? because spider man, ms marvel, iron man, ghost rider and doom sounds familiar, also star lord saounds like katsuyuki konishi
Ms marvel should've been black widow she's never been in a fighting game and she's a way older character
Aye Storm tho😏
This is just Marvel vs Capcom but with significantly less characters.   I just want a new X-Men vs Street Fighter game.  I'm tired of Marvel always shoving the Avengers in everyone's face.
Not until know have i regretted owning an Xbox
Can they stop trying to make Ms. Marvel/ Kamala Khan a thing already? Nobody likes this character no matter how many properties they push her into
Marvel are killing it lately
Wish it was also on switch 2, but it looks great for PS5
MCU引き継ぎのcvとか最高かよ！
close enough, welcome back UMVC3
Marvel Vs Arc System Works
Marvel vs. FighterZ
Hopefully we get English voices, I want the Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes voices for Captain America and Iron Man to return.
Nothing like a bunch of cringey gibberish from whiny VAs to make a cool idea look and sound like a nightmare
MAXIMUM SPIDER! CHARGING STAR! PROTON CANNON! TYPHOON! FOOTDIVE!
Just put Dante and Vergil as DLC for no reason, and that's all I'll need lol
Better have hulk
Insane
Spider man saying spidy sense like it's an attack
Yo, Max Dood has to have the most confused reaction possible to this.
Lol, only asian dev understand to make marvel game,,
YES SIRRR!!!
Is it just me or does star lord sound like akiyama(from yakuza)
Então não tem Marvel Vs Capcom 4?🤔
Finally we have a solo AAA Marvel Fighting game on consoles which we haven't had since basically Rise of the imperfects.
Hold on an actual Marvel fighting game I haven't seen something like this since rise of the imperfects
Gambit, Deadpool, Bishop/Cable & Vemon pls
I’m so tired of seeing Robbie Reyes
no lie but i wish its ONLY XMEN
Yay another fighting that will die after 2 week 😂😂😂
Definitely maining Iron and Ghost Rider
Arc System never disappoint! ❤🧡💛💚💙💜
YALL MADE A GROWN MAN CRY!!!!
Wow, I was already looking forward to  Marvel Cosmic Invasion.  We'll see if I can get it (I'm a PS4 guy). I've enjoyed a lot of Arc games. Amazing trailer. 😀
Where is my foot dive on doom
I think many will be glad the art style is going back to something more animated-looking than MVC:I
That Iron Man.... they better make that suit a model kit.
Daredevils Gym in the background with Doom
Robbie Reyes let's goooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
2:01 Totemo Kawai
Anime and Marvel combined as one, Let's go!
😏
I wish Arcsys did Hunter x Hunter Nen Impact  😭
If this game has traditional inputs I will cry tears of joy. 2xko is tryna put that special button nonsense in and hxh nen impact has the most bunz control scheme ever created so I am praying my goat arcsys won't let me down.
Where did this come from?!😯
We are finally getting a Marvel fighting game
Did doom just pull out a clock
This is what happens when y'all keep asking Arcsys to make every fighting game. DBFZ & Strive mixed in 1. Yay.  Arcsys gameplay Fatigue is gonna be something else
Who is the Main Spiderman in here ?🕷️🔴
Hope the roster is deep
ArcSys handling a Marvel tag fighter? Sign me up. I’m hyped.
So, Guilty Gear Vs. Marvel?
Absolutely amazing. Even if it isn’t mvc4, and I already love the artstyle and esthetic more than rivals 😁
Marvel vs Capcom 4 is soooooooo  happening!
kamala has her powers and star lords actually got his element guns and the game look epic ts peak
look perfect if kamala is not in the game
THIS IS SICK HELL YEAH
Marvel Writers Room be like: 1:51
Looks amazing ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
Gundam Iron Man! ❤
Oh baby,  we're way way way way past the days of Marvel Nemesis and Infinate, this is a new golden age!
Tekken? Nah, we have Tōkon
Close enough, welcome back Marvel Super Heroes Arcade
This looks one hundred times than the latest marvel v capcom
1:52 aww hell nah they jumping spidey man 😭
Forget where is Marvel the real question is where is the pre-order?
MAHVEL BABY!
Time for Tatsunoko vs Capcom 2.
Well, so much for a new MvC
WHERE THE HELL IS RYU?!?!?
THANK YOU FOR THIS GAME!
Seems the key to success for Marvel video games is to go full weeb.
4v4 is absolutely insane!!! Capcom made marvel super heroes back in the day, now arc system works are making their own. I cannot wait to play this insanity of a game!!!
Marvel Vs Arc?
Main doctor doom since day one
DB Fighterz was a turning point for Marvel and a nail in the coffin for Capcom  At least this means they can work on a potential CvS3
I need Cyclops and Jean Grey in this game, that's my only requirement to buy it.
Ms Marvel being here makes me so happy, omg
Cool....now can you add Scarlet Witch, thanks.
So no Marvel Vs Capcom 4 ?
BRO!
Please no one button specials only
MAHVEL BABY
MAHVEL IS BACKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
4v4 is gonna be fun! Wonder who i will learn, and who will be stuck as Assists
THIS LOOKS SOOOOOOO SICK 😮😮😮
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
I really love Ms. Marvel’s design!
Lythero: time to cook
Dragon Ball Fighterz.... But Marvel
I miss dbfz man when it was good
Looks interesting
We're really out here getting 4v4 before MVC4
this loooks like dragon ball z ngl
yes
Iron man looking like a Gundam and a Kamen Rider at the same time is so cool
It has never been more back than right now.
Me Thinking Marvel Rivals was Marvel’s Big Success In Gaming History.
daaayaaam this looks good. every frame looks like you can print it out and frame it
omg Ms Marvel so cute
This looks amazing... Hopefully venom is added
I am so hard rn
Please I beg you ArcSys add Jeff
Storm...that is all
When rumors were going around about NRS making a Marvel fighter, I told myself, "Arksys would be better fit.."  4v4 is crazy, but give me Rogue, and im all in.
Guess MvC is gone for now, but this is so awesome that I can live with that.
FINALLY WE GET MARVEL VS MARVEL 🔥🔥🔥
Marvel we gotta start a Marvel Game Universe atp. Marvel fans be eating good for sometime. LFG
BRO ALL YOU HAVE TO DO WAS TO ADD CAPCOM CHARACTERS 😭😭😭 (I'll buy this)
Marvel 4 time! 😊
Looks good.
Ugh, where’s the real Ms Marvel? I don’t want no gomu gomu fist Marvel.
"We wanted a team that's going to be crazy"  Arc System Works : *tilting shades down* "Let's rock!"    Also, PLEASE give us Sol as a guest fighter
YOSHAAA!
Ps5 or pc. Man, I would have enjoyed this game. Oh well.
I could cry from happiness rn. MAHVEL IS BACK BABY
OMG ITS CINEMAAAAA
I can't remember the last time I was excited for a Marvel property.
Grabbing this on steam for my legion go
playstation exclusive? :|
I swear, if Nightcrawler misses this game...
Marvel vs Capcom minus Capcom
Move over Capcom, you wasted your opportunity. Love Marvel Capcom games but this I can't wait for.
A marvel fighting game with x-men!it’s been 10000 years….
It's Mahvel
Is Blue Marvel in the game if not it is pass for me.
I just realized we could possibly fight with Jeff the Land Shark
Why does this look so amazing? Now I see why ArcSys neglected DBFZ (unfortunately). Holyyyy
Me encanta ❤❤ al fin se ve un gran juego, ya basta de Capcom, arc system mil veces mejor
Is it just me, or does this look way better than Injustice? I mean, personally, I prefer a fighting game with simpler animation rather than something weirdly realistic. Anyway, this game looks great.
Can’t wait to go from Rivals to Tōkon! ❤
it's so purty...... also doom pullin a piece on someone is amazing.
0:48 the spider sense move was hard asf🔥
So um.... Possibly Marvel vs Arc Sys in the future?
4v4 is a bit crazy but HOLY PEAK WE ARE SO BACK
Hell yeah!
Dragon ball fighterz but marvel
This looks amazing
Capcom: where's our invite
Has anyone checked in on Max?
Imma watch this as many times as it takes for the algorithm to understand what matters in life
It's not even a question at all whether or not I want this. 😆
Love the art style. This is what I wanted from Street Fighter, not bulky steroid ragers. Manga Marvel fighter. 2026 is so far away.
Meanwhile DC is busy making Dark Legion and Worlds Collide, ehh. I love WB games almost as much as mobile games.
Masterclass
Wheres the rest of the X-men
i'm crying so much
Move over China. It’s Japans turn now.
This looks amazing! Finally an all Marvel fighting game. How do you say Excelsior! in Japanese lol
This looks SIICKKK 🔥🔥🔥
Should have made it like granblue if they were dropping capcom
Cool game--bad name😅
Will this game be playable in English?
I’m playing this day one I don’t care
Huh, I like the more anime looks of the characters.
SPIDER-MAN 2H
cool.... but wolverine news?
Muito bom o jogo ^^
The beat em up game coming out, now this? We're so back
/kamala presence make me barf
El hype que sentí se fue tan rápido cuando no ví xbox :(
Marvel can you pull your heads out of your asses and give us back Marvel Heroes!! or atleast turn the servers back on!!
This what kameos in mk1 shouldve been like
THANK YOU for letting ArcSys cook without forcing them to make a game for MoDeRn AuDieNceS. You will be rewarded financially.
Wow wow wow!!! Sorry my people but day 1 on I'm on it
ROBBIES REYES MY GOAT
I originally wanted a DBFZ 2 But THIS, This is AMAZING!
take my money
0:58 close enough, welcome back UMVC3 Dante
Meh
Umm capcom????
Wow, looks really great. Hope just a lot of characters and x-men
huh
No Xbox launch?
Bruh dont care it has a sony logo on it aint buying it lmfaoo
Marvel vs Marvel hell yeah 🗣️🔥‼️
I NEED IT
It's Marvel FighterZ Baby Woooooooohooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!! Let's Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!
YES ! YEES !
Marvel: Lets not play with Capcom anymore, Lets see what Dragonball FighterZ are doing
Wow nice
All of the characters look 🔥
Ms. Marvel - the dude nobody invited
Marvel raivels players: NO JEFF NO MONEY
Nah doom slow walk is aura
Gonna need Black Cat and Squirrel Girl ASAP
Spidey sense is an attack? Lol
DAZZLER DAZZLER DAZZLER SHES GONNA BE IN THIS GAME SHES CLEARLY IN THE BACK OF THAT MAP AND ON A POSTER ON THE STREET
I want to play as Dr doom, storm and star lord so badly.
Close enough, welcome back Marvel Mangaverse
Ma, the Marvel Heroes are fighting each other, again.
When I tell the enemy spiderman to 1v1 me in Rivals, this is what I mean
4 v 4 What a fantastic number!! Let me be clear, I don't think it's a stretch to say this game is going to be fire. And here's the thing, I couldn't wish for a more fantastic studio to be developing it.
No Xbox?
MARVEL VS CAPCOM 4 BABYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Is that diavolo voicing ghost rider,
A marvel fighting game made by Arc system? LETS GOOOO
FINALLY
Doom pulled out da Glock   I need DD on this game!!
Why Kamala Khan?  No one likes her.
Cool, but since it's a Playstation game I'm skipping this one.
Chinese developers decided to make “Marvel Overwatch” (but better). Now Japanese developers decide to cook “Marvel Street Sighters” game.
thats really looks like 2xko in the animation type
Straight from Marvel vs Capcom.
4 V 4!!!!!!!!!??????
Who saw this coming lol
1:55 foot dive
Man I hope they get different outfits those designs are…rough
I wish I could play that Anton Ego gif here…
IS THAT THE SPIDER-MAN "FAKE RED" SUIT??????
This Storm design is so glorious!
RIP 2KXO RIP MvC4
Here comes a new challenger: Japan!!
PRAYING that this has a stacked roster. Like at least 32 fighters. Hopefully Thanos, Ultron, Thor, Hulk and all the marvel characters who got popular in the MCU are in it too.
War of the Gems and Children of the Atom is back!
IT AIN'T MVC4! BUT WE'LL TAKE IT! I LOVE IT! ARC BE KILLIN' IT! XD
Please be good...
Suppaidaman da 🕷
It's gonna have so much dlc
Yes they finally have there own street fighter like game 🤩
Its like dbfightrz
I have to admit, I don't like anime at all, but that Gundam inspired Iron Man looks freaking sweet; if Moon Knight is in this I might consider playing it
Finally...Marvel without those pesky Capcom characters.
Ah yes my favorite game Marvel FighterZ
They won't stop shoehorning Kamala Khan into everything. They keep repeating the same failed experiment, expecting a different result.
I’ve never been this excited for a marvel fighting game since Marvel vs Capcom 3
Also, let Japan make decent Marvel anime series or movie.
Cmon, man, we got Marvel rivals.
This looks absolutely fantastic!!!
Man seriously. Now we need a new and fresh Marvel ultimate alliance game
10 MORE YEARS
Disney knew that they can’t change society, so instead of relegating on themselves, they blamed the consumer. Duel one, Assamble!
Iron man in the Gundam armor is peak tbh
Did Doctor Doom just pull out the strap!?!?!
Arc SYS, 10 characters on release, 25 DLC at a price it's not worth it.
Epic store like mobile?????
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE ROSTER FOR THIS GAME!
This is a dream come true 🥹 Arc x Marvel is the greatest combo
Bruh!
IZ MAHVEL BABY!!
Where is the sequel to GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY?!!
Gonna look for the most "boring" characters. You know they are going to be goated when you practice with them. Captain America main incoming- can't wait to see who else is in store.
Would have preferred 1v1 because 4v4 sounds too silly and the designs are interesting, but I trust it'll be enjoyable, so, good enough, *WELCOME BACK MAHVEL VS.*
I’m very hyped for this!!!!
Holy 👀🤬🤯😭 MARVEL IS BACK!!!
The closest Marvel vs. Capcom fans are getting to MvC 5
WHEN'S MAHVEL
ArcSys is the GOAT of this generation of fighting games
Dudeee, This is Sick! And if arcsys is making it you know is going to be a great fighting game!
OMG, nobody saw that coming lol Love it @___@
When is it coming out
Marvel want to make Doom more mainstream.
This game looks sick
And the artwork is better then the last MVC...
Meanwhile.. Riot has been working on 2XKO for like 5 years and still sitting in beta..
ITS MAVEL BABY?!
why do they look like that
WHERE'S THE FOOT DIVE FOR DOOM!?!1?!
This came out of nowhere 😅 And it looks amazing
IT'S MAHVEL BAYBEE
Do you there will be alternative Skins? Because if i am not wrong the games of Arc system have only alternative colors
Never thought I’d see my goats Star-lord, Robbie Reyes Ghost Rider and Doctor Doom all in the same game
SUPAIDAMAN PLEASE
I need to see more before a final veredict
If Wolverine’s in this game, then I’ll play it!
2026 shaping up to be a good year already
Oh boy a fighting game. How long do you think this one will last before the fighting game community says “man this fighting game that’s just a fighting game has nothing new, just fighting and now I’m bored of it😱” (ie the last set of fighting games that came out)
Iron Man looks like gundam and this game reminds me of tekken or street fighter
Okay so dc is mortal kombats apprentice while marvel is street fighters
holy shiiii, the designs look so amazing. this is the best
I love how they made Star lord's ultimate the same as Dante's inMVC3 as an homage. Im hyped
This is why Capcom couldn't get that license again
I wish it would release for the switch 😊
Learning 4 characters to start playing is a crazy ask for a casual tho
When’s Marvel? NOW’s Marvel!
Love ArcSys and I'm so hyped for this game. A little sad MVC4 likely died for this to exist but I'm so down for anything ArcSys puts out. That names got to change though.
No Xbox 😢
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON????!!!
Bro, these voice actors are so good
I need Miles Morales & Black Panter playable ASAP🎉🎉🎉
No switch 2 and Xbox for a Marvel Game? Weird
Where's Wolverine?
Marvel X Dragon Ball fighterz
DC: Injustice, a dark and brooding mortal Kombat like game. Marvel: Tokon, a fun, cool street fighter like game. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
This looks amazing!!!!
Yoooooo
Ps4?
Is it just me or does iron man new armor resemble a little bit of gundam?
This was the best way to end the state of play💯
4 v 4? They're better be atleast 30 character at launch.
It's MAHVEL time
That's great, I hope they add a lot of characters to this game. I'm willing to, and if the DLCs are paid, I'll still buy them.
CARALHO, VLW MARLVEL.
4v4 tag battles… what MvC4 was supposed to be.  But I’m SOLD on this!
Man it’s gonna be exciting to see these Marvel Rivals fight each other!
I literally clicked on this and was like meehhhh, am I even gunna care? And then like 3 secs pass and I see Arc Systems and I'm like 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😤😤!!!
Hyperventilating
ASSEMBLE
They finally showing ghost rider and ms marvel love 🐐
The FGC is FEASTING!!!!
I've seen this before.. where's Dante, Ryu and my beloved *Morrigan* 🦇
AH if only guilty gear strive had a tagging system like this it would’ve been so much better then the one we got
MARVEL VS CAPCOM KILLER
When's Marveeel? NOOOOOW'S MAAAAAARVEL.
WE ARE SOOOOO BACK 😂🔥
Marvel v Capcom hold the Capcom
Yoo we getting supaidaman cant wait
That soundtrack is fire!!!!
Finally another Arcsys fighting game.  It's been too long my love
Can't wait for it to come to Xbox in 2030 maybe
Yo, that Storm design! An ArcSys, 4v4, Marvel fighting game? I have no interest in playing it, but I NEED to see what a certain Dood thinks about it.
I WANNA PLAY RIGHT NOW
Who asked for this
Marvel vs. DC Comics
Marvel fighterZ
Omg made by the same people who made guilty gear strive
No Wolverine?!
Marvel gaming so far way better than Marvel films
This looks cool as hell
We got Marvel Token before Insomniac Wolverine is crazy!
1:42  MY WIFE
I’m all in
This is how Marvel vs Capcom 5 supposed to have been
Is this game going to be free next year?
Marvel Games is COOKING
God, I hope they do Thanos
This what I was hoping along ago when CAPCOM was trying to make a VS Series with only Capcom fighters but that was a fail. They could restart it again so they dont have to get Marvel license in the future but do both if they want.... heck if they can get SNK to join too... **********  Capcom Vs Marvel Vs SNK.... start it because this new game is about to cook!
1:33  DR DOOM
where's the "footdive?"
Dio mio lo voglio ora
Okay, now we need Winter Soldier
IT'S... Mahvel baby?
DAREDEVIL PLEASE
Hell yeah! Marvel, ARC systems and PlayStation getting together to make a fighting game!!!
This looks wild!!!
They’ve got Iron-man looking like Mecha Viewtiful Joe. I love it!
Looks hype, but why is miss marvel in the game bruh 🤢
Marvel Rivals 2?
Xbox players crying rn I bet lol
That's why ArcSys bothered to release the 3v3 mode and left Guilty Gear Strive without a patch for over a year lol
ONCE AGAIN, EASTERN DEVELOPERS SHOWING HOW IS IT DONE!
This is the first time I heard of this game, never thought i'd see the makers of DB Fighterz doing a Marvel game and it looks fantastic!
Looks pretty sick tbh
MS. MARVEL OG POWER❤❤❤
Marvel VS capcom 3 vibe !!!
diavolo ghostrider is quite amazing
This game looks incredible can't wait. If injustice 3 comes out too superhero fans are gonna eat super good next few years.
This looks crazy!
If comboing 2 characters is a Happy Birthday, and 3 is a Merry Christmas, then all four should be called a Happy New Year.
AYOOO
YES, HAHA... YES!!!!!!
can we call this Mahvel already? who played thisss speak uppppp!
This looks absolutely freaking insane, wonder what the final roster size will be
Yep, that's a Marvel fighting game LETS GO
Fitting that the only thing that can fight Marvel's heroes... are Marvel themselves.
Yay!!!
WHAAAAT! This is DOPE! Gimme Captain Marvel playable!
What timeline is this? Lol
WE NEVER BEING SO CLOSED FROM SOL BADGUY VOLCANIC VIPERING IRON MAN
great....MVC is dead
This is going to be an industry defining moment. This is going to create a whole generation of FGC members and I cannot WAIT.
PLEASE LET IT BE 6 BUTTONS BRUH! TIRED OF THE 1 - 3 BUTTON COMBOS!!!
I don’t speak Japanese, so I have zero idea what they are saying.
Give us Nightcrawler
Not in Xbox? 😢
Arc knows what they are doing
Looks dope, but i kinda hope theres a way to have less characters (kinds like skullgirls) i already didn't want to learn 3 characters for MvC3 and like only having to learn 2 for MvCI, would have liked it to stay at 2 or 3 at max.
Oh they cooked with ttis
Hey if Batman and the Suicide Squad can get Isekai’d then why not?
fire
FINALLY this is what modern MvC games should’ve looked like all along. 3D models that look 2D and ofc Arc are the ones to do it. Capcom fumbled every MvC after 2
Nobody likes Ms marvel.
MARVEL FIGHTERZ?!
Wall breaks actually made me sad. Please remove it 🙏
The what?
Dragon ball fighterZ I’m in it to win it
Man, about their Marvel game — they showed the entire development process during the event. Come on, save that for your own channel or release it after the show ends. State of Play should focus on announcing new games and showcasing gameplay, nothing more. I'm really disappointed. Hopefully, Xbox can step up and do better."
Thank god for this
When Disney has been failing and most usa Triple AAA game devs load and behold netease and arc systems had to pull up and just say 'Fine I'll do it myself'
Close enough, welcome MVC4
First a hero shooter, then a beat em up, now a fighting game. We're in Marvel video game renaissance!
This is fantastic news! However with EIGHT characters in a match, we are gonna need a MASSIVE roster to keep this one rolling! Also, so long as it launches at the same time on both PS5 and PC, just tell me when I can wishlist!!
they really said "we need more"
At least some of those moves and animations looked ripped right from the Marvel VS Capcom series games
THIS ISN'T DBFZ2 BUT I'M NOT COMPLAINING
Imagine your going to pick up the new Switch 2 tonight, and you see this. Playstation wins again!
The world is healing...
The Team red equivalent of Cross Tag is gonna go crazy if Arc Sys ever does it.
It's like Dragon Ball Fighterz!
This looks great! It's Marvel VS Capcom with no Capcom 😂
มี ลูฟี่ด้วยแฮะ
I can't believe it
oh yeah we could get a mr fantastic but they really had to push Kamala slop khan to this
Marvel minus capcom
I really hope this doesn't mean we aren't getting a new Marvel vs Capcom game, but either way, this looks spectacular. ArcSys never fails to deliver with their fighting games, and the whole aesthetic being a sort of mix between Marvel Rivals and Guilty Gear Strive looks amazing.
For a game company, they make such good movies
they should bring these as skins in Rivals, not gonna lie I want Caps outfit here as a skin for Rivals
No way we got arcsys marvel fighter before MVC4
Why does this game play almost look like  guilty gear strive 🤔
the hype i had thinking this was a new marvel vs capcom was INSANE (still hype though)
Wait, so they wanted to do a Marvel fighter and they went with Arksys? Sure glad there’s no other company that could do it. One with a legacy of doing it that people have wanted to come back for years. Sure glad they don’t exist.
Marvel Rivals and Marvel Tokon = Thick Marvel.
Close enough, welcome back MvC!
so since guests are very trendy in fg nowadays, just invite all the capcom characters now 😋
Wow, they made Mrs. Marvel cute, surely her curse won't tank this game, right?
2XKO found death in a ditch
Is Capcom gonna go "screw you guys" and make Capcom vs Capcom now
That was actually so good. From the voice acting to the art style
it could be 2026 fighting game of the year.
Bruh imagine what ArcSys would do with MVC4
DAY ONE PURCHASE...!
Whoever decided that Marvel should outsource their IP to game devs outside of America is a genius.
I can't imagine how they would create the Hulk. And if ever get their hands on Deadpool,they would make him insanely savage as well as incredibly silly!
One of the worst games I've ever seen at an event 😂
Marvel without Capcom: Fine, I'll do it myself.
Hope they do a Crossover by having these outfits in Rivals
It's mahvel baby
FOOT DIVE SPOTTED 1:56
I Hope Deadpool appears in The Game as DLC
Marvel Rivals now this, Eastern marvel games are cooking!!!!
Beautiful art style 🙏🙏
ARC System Works. BlazBlue. GranBlue. DB Fighters. Under Knight. Guilty Gear. And now... Marvel.   All the energies in the cosmos are aligning.
MARVEL BABY!
Id give a kidney to play an alpha version
Xbox????
Oh yes
MAHVEL LIVES
This what Marvel vs Capcom 3 should've been like, not the unplayeable mess we got
LETS GOOOOO
Man that looks awesome leave it to the Asian cultures on how to make Marvel superheroes look freaking awesome first China with Marvel Legends now Japan with this game I definitely want to try to get my hands on it hope it's not PlayStation exclusive
Imagine the DLC  "...VS. Capcom"
Looking forward to Marvel Tokon vs Capcom 1 in 2028😁
We got an Arc Systems Marvel Fighting game before GTA6 what is this timeline?
So it’s not “Marvel”…… but it’s Marvel….. I’m deeply conflicted.
Good stuff
Gonna take us for a ride
This looks PEAAAAK!!!
Wooosa
So this was they been working on instead mvc4 but im here for it n its fope asf
PEAK
MAX WAS RIGHT??? 4v4 HE SAID IT’D BE INSANE AND THEY WERE ALREADY 4 STEPS AHEAD!!!!!
IT'S MAHVEL BABY!!!  ... wait...
IT’S MAHVEL BAYBEE!  It’s a lot different, but it’s still Mahvel baybee!
Was i the only one waiting for ryu to show up
MAHVEL IS BACK BAYBYYYY
Marvel is cap....oh never mind
Is that Robbie Rayes Ghost Rider?
Capcom please take notes
Marvel has my attention
You had me sold when Kamala Khan appeared.
YEEEESSS!This looks so awesome and the designs for everyone are amazing.
The only bad thing about this is having to wait till next year!  Also shout out for using my boy Robbie.
Que mal que capcom no haga colaboración con marvel y hagan un marvel vs capcom 4 😔
Yooo marvel fighting game ?
An Arcsys 4v4 Marvel Fighting Game?!? I never saw it coming
Man I wish I have a console 😢
Close enough....ITS MAHVEL BABY
please, dont add the wall splat from Strive.
its like Marvel vs Capcom but Marvel vs Marvel instead
DragonBallFighterZ with Marvel characters. Not a bad thing, just unfortunate that Capcom dropped the ball this hard because Marvel Vs Capcom is the pinnacle of team fighters. On the brightside it's going to introduce a lot of people to fighting games.
Stupid game
We haven't had a new Marvel fighting game since 2017. Arc System Works really just said "Fine. I'll do myself."
Finally I won't have to pretend that capcom characters exist alongside my marvel Bois!!!!!
It's kind of Mahvel, baby?
Hopefully they add Gwenpool
Dreams come true
Hope there is an English dialogue option. I get that people are obsessed with Japanese voice actors or whatever, but like... I don't speak Japanese and I don't enjoy reading dialogue that is supposed to be heard.
See you at san diego and new york comic con 2025 this year
let fk goo i all ways wanted a marvel fighting game and now we are getting it thank u marvel and arc for this game cant wait for 2026 peak is coming soon
Without the Capcom characters, this feels underwhelming. I’m good.
No ps4 :'(
ArcSys made Hunter×Hunter stiff as hell but they cooked with this one.
Time to find more SPIDEY TECH! We covering this for SURE!
People wanted marcel vs capcom but we got marvel overture cross tag battle sign. Anyways the game looks FABOLOUS. Let arcsys cook man
I'm excited and conflicted lol. Because I still want to see Marvel vs Capcom 4. While on the other hand excited about what Arc system is doing. Is Capcom still doing Marvel vs Capcom for the foreseeable future? We'll see
A MARVEL FIGHTING GAME MADE BY ARCSYS WAS QUITE LITERALLY MY DREAM GAME! I'M SO HAPPY RN!
WE ARE EATING SO GOOD RIGHT NOW!!!
Move aside Xbox crybabies it's Playstation 5 time we cooking  since I am a og Playstation gamer I definitely hype for marvel tokon fighting souls 2026 let's goooooooooo
Omg
Marvel Super Heroes 2 anyone?
What the hell do you mean it’s gonna have 4v4
1:24 Doom pulled out the "Domain Expansion: Gun!" On Robbie
IT'S MAHVEL BABY !!
Doom has a strap 😭😭😭
HELL YEAA
POGGERS
Let's go!!!!🔥😈
Once again showing its not marvel fatigue but MCU fatigue. If more marvel stuff just either took inspiration from the comics or did their own thing instead of following the movies or taking visual inspiration from them, it shows that devs can cook.
I really hope it’s free game because if not we got a problem
this isn't capcom...
ITS TIME BRO WHO PLAYING THIS ON STREAM!! I WILL DEFINITELY TRY
Full monkey paw, we got this instead of MvC, no complaining tho, this looks amazing
MCU had to die for the MGU to rise
Marvel making goated things before GTA 6
Please for the love of God have moonknight and you WILL HAVE MY MONEY
Was honestly expecting arc to do mha or jjk but marvel is insanely cool
Marvel vs. Capcom vibes
ArcSys found the Infinite Money Glitch
I expect this Marvel vs Marvel having a colab with CAPCOM
Marvel fighting ❤ AAAAAAAAAA
Tokon means “Fighting Spirit/Soul” so the title is Marvel Fighting Soul: Fighting Souls 😂
OK, I wont bother CAPCOM anymore.  Here I come, Arc!
Marvel Guilty Gear is real ans looks so GOOD!!!
IT'S MAHVEL BABY
Marvel without Capcom 😔
So basically a tekken like marvel fighting game
4 v 4... gotta have the a FANTASTIC team to make a good...hmmm same year the movie comes out huh?
Max about to lose his shiii
WHAT THE HELL IS IN SUMMER GAMES FEST TO GIVE US THIS IN STATE OF PLAY
Looks like xbox and nintendo aren't getting this one
What have you done, Arc? You took the elements of Marvel and created a new form of art that blew all our minds in ways we never thought were possible? 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
I LOVE U!
Starlord  main here
deadpool and wolverine better be in this game
Eis aqui o jogo da minha vida
Amazing, Arc System Works will give it the love it deserves.
Later, Capcom stands outside Marvel's offices with a boombox playing Spider-Man's MVC3 theme over his head as he begs Marvel to take him back.
6 Assists on the screen with your point characters is gonna be a mess  But I’m gon let ArcSys cook
HOLY PEAK
WE'RE BACK
I always wanted a full on marvel universe fighting game and I finally got my wish all we need is some of the most Iconic va voicing everyone and this game will be perfect
O PS4 tá ficando de lado para tudo 😢
R.I.P. Marvel Vs. Capcom,
What is Capcom going to do now?!?
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS REAL!
Looks better than Marvel rivals finally the marvel version of injustice.
Why Dr.Doom walk like he know he the freshest person ever to live 😂😂
I actually can't believe it... this actually happen XD look very Good thought 🔥
ITS MAHVEL BABY!!!
rest in peace mvc4
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?!  DO WE NEED MARVEL VS CAPCOM?!
The fact that the developers of the game took the idea of the dbfz game and made it into a marvel game This era is so peak for marvel games
IT'S SO OVER FOR MVC 😭😭😭
Marvel Street Fighter really Genius.
Ms. Marvel LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
...So Max is losing his mind, just FYI. XD
Everything about this looks cool except Spider-Man. Jesus Christ, his suit is a whole nother level of trash.
Omg!! This is hype!!! Spidey day one!
Xbox and Nintendo: "Well fine if you don't want my money"
The kusoge patch for this is gonna be crazy
We're gonna need a term for comboing 4 enemies.  I suggest "Happy New Year"
Will this be on Xbox!!! ?
First Dragon Ball and now Marvel. They are definitely doing DC next.
Arc System Works showing how it's done
Oh HELL yeah! I can’t wait to see all the character’s designs
Absolute cinema
That is Marvel blazing
NOW THIS IS PEAK, LES GOOOOO
LFG!!!
4 VS 4????
we're in the correct timeline
Hopefully they have alternate classic skins
I wanted a Disney platform fighter but why not
i hope the do a mode with 8 players
This looks hype. Can't wait!
Star Lord being voiced by Spike's VA is so fitting
MAGIK BETTER BE IN THIS GAME!
Wow looks good Storm ⛈️ Queen hopefully we get DLC OUTFIT
It's difficult to watch divorce proceedings live Hope Capcom doesn't need to pay child support
Hey Max is there any chance of Marvel vs Capcom 4..........
My mind has been blown
Man, Storm is so attractive here as well. Now I play the waiting game for very specific art of her in this design.
🎶I wanna take you for a ride🎶
0:59 that looks like Dante's special attack from MvC
They need to add j Johana Jameson
Marvel with Guilty Gear graphics. HYPE!
Magik better be in this game, too! Not to mention Wolverine!
OH..... MY... GOOOOD!
This trailer blew my mind!
The last fighting game I bought was MvC3 Ultimate for the Vita back in 2012. This is really intriguing!
This looks good
Hueta
Where is IFCYipes on this bro?! IT'S MAHVEL
One day we will have a good Marvel vs DC game.
Juggernaut plisssssss Marvel Games
Will this game be released for android?
とうとうストリートファイターきた
RIP 2XKO
So Marvel Strive...Ok I will take it I guess.
I was so hyped when this was revealed in the State of Play. First of all, the art style looks gorgeous. It looked like if you put the MvC art style in an anime. Secondly, the designs look fire. I never thought i'd see the day where Iron Man looks like a Gundam but here we are. Cap got the drip and so does Doom, I love Ghost Rider's design and it looks like its gonna be the Robbie Reyes version and not Johnny Blaze which is awesome, and Spider Man, Star Lord, Ms Marvel, and Storm also looking immaculate. And the fighting gameplay looks absolutely like MvC and again, looks fire with the art style. Cant wait for this game
HYPED
Can someone tell Marvel to stop with the overdesigned costumes with a ton of random lines and etching? It's bothering the hell outta me.
Mvc for the high school anime club
TOBEY MAGUIRE FIGHT ??
Holy... The sticks are coming back out for this one lads.
I'm so happy to see kamala. I wanted to see her back in mvci but I'm glad she's finally here.
Can I start asking for Cyclops now or...?
Nani?!?! Anime Marvel Fighting Game?!?!?!
FROM MARVEL RIVALS TOO FIGHTING SOULS MARVEL GAMES IS SOO BACK!!
That art style is simply incredible. There must be some big money in this project. Those animations are blowing my mind. Very cool to see a Marvel focused game, we’ve had enough MVC games and the last one flopped badly. ArcSystem never disappoints.
I hope they gave doom his FOOT DIVE
oh wow
I have so many hours logged in fighterz I am beyond ready for this. Please let this be cross platform aswell
Marvel Vs Capcom Minus Capcom
Man, this is lit as F. It's the new Marvel vs Capcom. Just with Marvel characters. Now i believe Capcom vs Snk 3 is happening before MvC4
Day 1 bomb
this looks unbelievable!
Why can’t we just have a 1v1 2D fighting game🤦‍♂️, its always a tag team, area fighter, or platformer
Now we wait for Wolverine, Blade Punisher, Winter Soldier and Deadpool to be announced!
MAGIK PLEASE
Marvel vs capcom 4 took so long, arcsys said we’ll do it ourselves.   Edit:also removed capcom.
KAMALA!
i loved the part where it took up 40% of the state of play
I feel nothing.
Lets goooooooo
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS REAL!! AND Marvel went to Arc System and NOT Capcom?! WHAT THE-
Ok so all the confirmed playable  characters are  iron Man Captain America  Ghost rider Ms Marvel Dr doom Storm Spider man Star lord  Maybe Thor because of the statue he has in the background  This can’t be the only characters they have. My wishlist of characters would be Wolverine Gambit HULK and moon knight or night crawler
Is this 4v4 co-op online?
Avengers assemble 🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥❤❤
Arcsys Mahvel is Kami tier obviously gonna need Capcom Reps as DLC
IT'S MARVEL, BABY!!!
More Japanese Spider-Man is something I never thought I needed
ts was not hype in the state of play gng just play marvel rivals atp
F AWESOME!!
Let gooooo!!! These designs are amazing!!!
HYPED!!!
This looks awesome! 👏
Welcome back Marvel vs Capcom...well kinda....
We keep winning guys
THEY SAW MARVEL 4 AND JUST WENT OH 4V4 OF COURSE
Give me all of the x men and a good story mode and content and it's all good 😊 most definitely saving up for this one ❤❤
WE WON OMG!!! Marvel fighter by ARCYS YO!!🤯🤯💯 need it.
wait, its captain america's seiyuu Satoru Gojo? Reinhard Van Astrea?
The hype is finally real
I can’t believe it!!! My most anticipated game of all time!!!!
DFBZ 2
The true Marvel Rivals….
Man, Marvel has been on a Generational Run lately! First Marvel Rivals, NOW A MARVEL 4 V 4 FIGHTERZ/MVC GAME?!?!? SIGN ME UP!!!!!!
All hopes for a new Marvel Vs Capcom game...  SHATTERED
Finally, free money in their pocket. Bring back the 90’s 🥹
This is where the HxH Nen Impact Budget went
DO NOT CANCEL THIS GAME PLS😭🙏
This is the feeling I been missing as a gamer  an unexpected non leak game… I’m so hype for this.. 2026 is cooking to be a awesome year for games
Dear God... a Marvel fighting game WITH MY X-MEN. YAAAAS!
Storm and iron man’s designs are amazing!!!
Dude!!!! I AM OVER THE F**KING MOON RIGHT NOW!!!!! IT’S MAHVEL BABY!!!
Marvel injustice?
Injustice Marvel's Edition?
>Not capcom Hm....
It may not be MvC, but it's still Mahvel baby.
After of years they finally made a marvel fighting game!
Marvel Fighter Hellyeah, Letsss gooo!!!!!
Sony, don't you dare to region lock this one!
No Xbox 😢
スパイダーマンの声優は川田紳司さんか⁈ アルティメットスパイダーマン育ちの俺には一番しっくり来るんだ
Spider-man going ultra instinct using spider sense is sooo lore accurate at this point😂   But nonetheless, this looks promising.
YESSIR!!!
This is the first Marvel game with japanese voices, and a non Marvel Vs. Capcom game. I like it! ;)
Me and my brother are going to be obsessed with this game, we both loved DBFZ!!!!!!!
I hope this will have a english dub version due to the fact it marvel. I wonder if they will have crossover characters from both arc system works and disney. (Guilty gear, Blazblue, Star wars, Alien and Predator.) Other then that this look very good and I love the detail with doom using a pistol in his moveset.
Friendship ended with Ryu, new friendship: Sol Badguy
ARE WE DEADASS
Mervel Vs Capcom Infinite R.I.P.
DUDE! A MARVEL FIGHTING GAME STREET FIGHTER STYLE?! I'm more hyped than when Marvel Rivals was announced.
THANK YOU ARCSYSTEMS

MY WISH HAS FINALLY BEEN GRANTED🎉🎉🎉🎉

Warner Bros. Games needs to step up their game. I can’t think of literally any upcoming Dc game.
i'm in love
Add Elektra pls.

Does this mean that MVC is oficialy dead?
MARVEL GEAR STRIVE   These would be sick marvel rivals skins tho
An anime style Marvel fighting game?  Oh hell yeah! AHHHHHHHHHHHHH

PS5 ftw 🎉
This is a dream come true 🥹 Arc x Marvel is the greatest combo
Very cool. Sign me up. Just curious... will there be a dubbed version?
Super duper game, I hope they do more projects this ambitious in the future.

Maxmillian doods just made a mess
Here's hoping that they'll add Danny Rand iron fist as a character, then again I'm seeing Robbie Reyez instead of Johnny Blaze and Kamala Khan instead of Carol Danverse so my hopes are low
Xbox?
MAINING MY BOI SPIDER MAN AND GHOST RIDER DAY ONE 🎉

Better have more than 8 characters for a 4v4 team battle game. Lol hyped nonetheless.
Chat was spamming L, I was hittin that W.
Please, give it a mode for 1v1 single fights with rounds. Let the fans of MSH have fun too.
They had us in the first half not gonna lie…
A marvel fighting game before GTA 6
WELCOME BACK MARVEL SUPER HEROES
It's MAHVEL baby!!!
Man, we need Insomniac’s Venom now!!!!!!!
A brand new Marvel fighting game from the company behind BlazBlue? SHUT UP & TAKE MY MONEY!
Gonna take you for a ride!
Star Lord is giving me massive mvc3 Dante vibes
ARC SYS GOATED
Max said the only way he could imagine in Marvel vs game going crazier than infinite tagging at any time system is 4v4, and they did it with Arc. I'm losing my mind
First Marvel Rivals now a marvel fighting game from Arcs of all studios. We eating good.
If this gets us closer to a marvel  versus CapCom being made by your system works, I’m OK with this
We went from 2v2 to 3v3 to 4v4. As someone who loves Marvel vs. Capcom im very excited for this
FINALLY!!! A successor to MvC! Seeing arc at the beginning immediately got me interested. I just want some good English voices, and more than eight characters total. But i am already going to see of i can wishlist it.
Fantastic Four gotta be available at release and also have some crazy chemistry
0:11 the things i felt
I am definitely buying this just for storm..
MAHVEL IS BACK BABYYYYY
INSANE GAMEPLAY
Hopefully this become peak!
This looks amazing asf
The Insomniac Wolverine game don’t even exist anymore, does it?
Excited!! But what’s with this tokon- Japanese title !
Arc System is the best fighting game company working today! It’s too bad their name is not on the same level of recognition as NeatherRealm who has been butchering their Mortal Kombat games after 11.
this looks cool as hell
Give me some English voice acting and I'm down!
Arc System Works: Capcom won’t make a Marvel fighting game, fine I’ll do it myself.
This is peak!
Ironman suit looks a combination of ultramarine and Gundam
what a freakin treat this is
Oh my god I was right…… I mean I yeah I totally called omg this is amazing totally pre ordering this
2xko who?
I wonder if it will have 2v2 in any way (like 4 real life ppl each controlling 2 characters maybe?)
God this looks clean
This is literally just fighter Z and I’m here for it
It's MAHVEL BABY
YO THIS IS AMAZING
This is literally the only other acceptable answer outside of "vs Capcom" and I am sooooooo happy.
Ggst vibes mixed with marvels clean comics book action goes SO HARD. Cannot wait!
IT'S MAHVEL BABY!!!
Insane announcement!!
This announcement is cooking. Marvel is straight up winning LFG!!!!!!!!
RIP 2XKO.
Hopefully there's a 1v1 mode or a 2v2
Is this with campaign?
Where's Capcom tho??
Xbox please????
Cool
this might good
A guilty gear style marvel fighting game... AWESOME hope we get some street level heroes like daredevil or iron fist
INSANE!!!!!!!
Sold
DOOM. THAT IS ALL.
RIP DC fans
Storm Supremacy
Marvel minus Capcom
Who ever is in charge of Marvel Games making all these picks for studios, I just wanna say thank you immensely
Take my money
Finally a Marvel Fighting game with true combos!
When I saw the arc system works logo, I knew they were cooking
The voice actors have done a amazing job better than whatever dc games r u doing.
Marvel is cooking crazy games nowadays ❤
Wish there was a larger roster
Xbox? 😢
Let’s go!!!!
they said "what's capcom? ill do it myself"
I'm so excited ❤
🔥🔥🔥
ROBBIE REYES GHOST RIDER???!!! Take my MONEY!
Will this end up being released dual audio?
OH YES..... This game looks good!! I want the entire Marvel universe at my disposal for this game 💯💯💯💯💯💯
MARVEL 4!!!!!🎉🎉🎉
I’m crying tearsss of joyyy
The first fighting game I might try since the PS2 LOL looks sick! GIMMIE VENOM!
Someone at Marvel HQ: Hear me out. Tekken, but make it Marvel Everyone else: yes
THERE IS ONLY DOOM
soooo marvel vs capcom without capcom? lame ahh shi
This is made by NRS right?
I’ve been asking for a pure Marvel fighting game for YEARS!!!!! This makes me cry tears of joy!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The art style looks awesome 🔥🔥🔥
Storms design... Is very nice to look at ladies and gentlemen.
Marvel vs capcom if it was anime
Incredible!!  Absolutely incredible!!!!  🙏🏽💪
$100 says Justin Wong will be the first EVO champion
Insanity...❤❤❤
Bro I was literally wanting for something like this
What’s the chances of seeing Man-Thing as a grapple character(
O M G
If I see ultron, insta buy. No questions asked. I don’t care how much.
Not MVC4 looking good 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This look so fire 🔥🔥🔥
No one predicted this in my friend group watching the state of play, but I can firmly say everyone I know is EXTREMELY HYPED.
Marvel vs Capcom 4 died for this.
i like how doom just has a gun
And we thought Marvel Rivals was fully anime.
I love that iron man looks like a gundam and we need Japanese spider-man as a skin 🙏🏻
Definitely getting this 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Doctor doom Ironman omg marvel u cooked a peak game
Arc systems Work😭omg I used to dream of days like this
🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂👍😎
MAHVELS BACK BABEH
it has potential i’ll give them that but i need to see more
MARVEL FIGHTERZ LETS GOOOO
What? Oh PS only. Dang
.... WHAT!?!?!? Arcsys is making a Marvel 4v4 fighting game!?!?!?!?!?!?!? This is the great moment of my life!!!!!😍
We finally got Japaneese Spider-Man back after all these years.
A Marvel Fighting Game made by Arc System Works akin to the likes of Dragon Ball FighterZ was not on my 2025 Bingo Card for upcoming video games, but you know what... I love it!
Marvel vs capcom isn’t happening for another 6 years
Yo, Evo is about to get a new heavy hitter!!! ❤❤❤
Marvel vs Marvel Japan
Arc System Works ate 2XKO 🎂
Looks less anime for an Arc game.
Ahhhhhhh
Ive been wanting a new marvel 2d fighting game forever at this point. Why is it Japanese tho?
This is really amazing marvel did break their limits with this one the creative team deserves a raise
YOOO MARVEL WITH NO CAPCOM
Amazing! This sould be epic!
Omg!!
Where is my Marvel vs Capcom?😡😡
This looks insane i need this already
Pretty sure im getting kicked out my apartment after reacting to this......worth it.
Absolute cinema
I love the art style of this game. Reminds me about Marvel vs Capcom.
Something I didn't know i wanted .....and now.....I WANT IT
I hope they release these designs qs marvel rivals skins
Hopefully they don't cancel it after a year or so .....
Always the same boring characters playable 🙄
The next Marvel fighting game and I am unable to play it bc it’s not on Xbox guess I have to stay with umvc3
Outstanding
Either Spider-Man will be mid-tier or Top-tier either way, I'm playing as him 😭
Looks like a mix of street fighter tekken and mk1
As someone who love Dragon Ball fighterz i appreciate this looking forward to this
It's Mah-Vel baby...
Hopefully more mutants are there like Cyclops, Rogue, Gambit, Colossus, Iceman, Wolverine, Nightcrawler and finally just add the whole Fantastic Four team
YOOOOOO WE GOT GHOST RIDER ?!! LET'S GOOOOOO !!!! 🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥💀💀💀
👁️👁️
2026 💔
Anime marvel v Capcom without the capcom
Release this on mobile
Arc system works + Marvel = Maximilian Dood’s mind being broken (and mine too)
Arcsystem❤❤❤
It may mdot be Nether Realm, but MAN, THIS LOOKS HYPE!!!
Omg it's street fighter!!!! With Johnny Storm!!!!! 2 of my favorite things
Yes
An arc system works Marvel fighting game?!?! Am I dreaming?!?!?!?
🔥🔥🔥
IT’S MAHVEL BAYBEE
This might be the greatest thing ever
The fact that it’s not coming to Xbox is kinda messing with my mental health rn
amazing!!!!
Wow!
show
Xbox Series????😢
I thought when it reversed, it was going to show Marvel's Wolverine. That would've been crazy.
Realy dont care for this game
WHAT IS THAT??!!!
So fire
Doom: MAX ASSIST ME!!!
THIS CARRIED THE STATE OF PLAY
.... So like what's DC's excuse?
4 vs. 4!?
1:42 is that a Tom from Tom & Jerry scream??
Much better than Rivals tbh 😅
This would've been the game that got me on PS if it was only on that but this seals the deal on me moving to PC from my Xbox instead.
Omg looks dope!
The fact there no Xbox sucks
Okay this is actually sick
🔥🔥🔥
Another marvel game? Are we going to have to pretend this one is good too?
We're getting MARVEL MINUS CAPCOM!.....But Seriously though ArcSys Marvel Tag Fighter looks Incredible ✨
OH MAH GODDDD! THIS LOOKS SO FREAKING GOOD MAAAANNNN!!!
Jesus Christ dood I can’t tell you how loyal I screamed
I know it’s going to be good game but l was expecting a video game of Ironman, Hulk or something else
Marvel Mortal Kombat before GTA 6… this timeline is wild 💀
The graphics look EPIC
Cooked
Marvel is getting their teeth kicked in so hard by anime/manga that they're japanizing their brand now.   honestly, looks like it'll work better than Ironheart
GHOST RIDERRRR 💀🔥🔥
Movies suck but marvel Games is on fire
YAYYYYYYYY
Why did it have to be in a anime art style?
billion time better than blackmyth wukong
THE GOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT.
This looks CRAZY!
Im so happy they didn't give marvel to neather realm. Arcsys is actually competent
THIS IS FANTASTIC
Nintendo Switch 2 version?
Can’t wait to hear “When’s Marvel?” Again.
DOOM
What MvC should be.... 😮
this looks fireeee
Why does it look similar to Marvel versus Capcom but anime style?
Wait your telling me the guys who made Dragon Ball Fighterz are making a Marvel Fighting game Before MvC4
❤❤❤❤❤❤ Less realism, more gameplay and art . Beautiful
It better be Yuri voicing Spider-Man
The answer to the genius question… NOW’S MAHVEL
Okay this looks dope
