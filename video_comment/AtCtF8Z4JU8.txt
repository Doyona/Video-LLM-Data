definitely will do a second playthrough ngl,since i wanted to play as every single faction.
Where does the modern audience keep hiding?
This game showcases some of the worst character designs the gaming industry has ever seen. The characters are not just unattractive—they are downright repulsive, dragging down the entire visual experience. It’s hard to believe the development team and studio thought these designs were acceptable for release. Their lack of attention to detail and artistic judgment has completely derailed what could have been a solid entry in a beloved franchise. No player wants to endure a game filled with characters that are an insult to the eyes. This isn’t just a poor creative choice—it’s a blatant failure that reflects badly on everyone involved.
Never ever I have been so heartbroken ever. I’ve played all of the other games and loved every minute of it, learnt sooo much cool lore about the franchise. Stayed up and read about all the diffrent lore and listning to videos that talk about it. I´ve loved all of the games...but this game is not the game that I’ve been waiting 10 years for.  The concept and the idea is exactly what I wanted!!! Where we got to meet the two last gods, got to know more about Blights and the fade and veil.   Those concepts is really good, by the Maker you reall messed that up and butchered everything.  What happened guys?! We loved you, we loved you soo much, I waited 10 years for this game and I am so disappointed I’m not straight myself, but omg you've made the game so cringe and forecing stuff upon the player.  (commeted on other posts as well)
G@Y ASS GAME
Dragon woke the failguard 😂😂😂
Just got done with this mission. Loved it. Created my alternate Blighted Dragon trailer with my character & the other dragon
Hate it, disgusting to the rest of the games
Imagine reusing same dragon for almost 10 times without changing barely anything Beyond terrible game design
Really sick of bipoc
Just finished this battle today. For me, the red dragon was the 1st dragon. Played a duelist main. Fight is utterly brutal, took me like 4 hours to make it through. But dam was it FUN! 🐲🐉
Nędza nie gra swe
It’s been so long I don’t even remember my Inquisitor
So you basically manipulated us and switched the dialogue?
Not a Dragon Age game
The worst game....... I don't understand how it has good reviews!!!! There's simply nothing to it about. And it doesn't smell like RPG at all.
Fellow disabled. There is no options for turning down flashing/particle effects/lightnings for anyone with photosensitivity/migraine/autism/epilepsy. They put no flash warnings on every trailer and the game. No one does this unless they want to do harm to our community.
Damn this trailer doesn't even come close to showing how hellish this fight is, I'm literally soaking wet with sweat from getting through this without potions 😂
🗑️
Bunch of Aqun-Athlok pandering.  This is just mental illness the game 😂
I don’t see Buzz lightyear in this Toy story. Why?
What did you do to popcap
Woke
玩这个游戏还需要做10个俯卧撑？太特么！扯！淡！了！
Someone looks worried about Mosnter Hunter Wilds lol
Go woke go broke ,|,, ',.,' ,,|,
This game is so gay.
Sooo... The boss fight was so boring and repetitive that you had to cut out combat moments every now and then, so we won't fall asleep   Its terryfying how badly those cuts were made anyway
Do you remember when this was a dark fantasy franchise? Pepperidge farm remembers.
EA can you close Bioware for making this woke shit? 🤢👀
Woke 🤮🤮🤮🗑️🤢
I actually don't mind the art style except for the character meshes which seem way too smooth and lacking detail. As for the gameplay, it looks soft... every attack just didn't feel impactful expect for the combo which was cool. Maybe its because they decided to use a mage but if they add a little more umph to the attacks and fix the skin textures this looks like it has some potential. Especially since I love Dragon Age games.  edit: forgot to mention that the voice acting for some of the characters at the beginning were rough while others were solid so idk what to think there.
So you watch a two hour film, play for ten minutes in a small map then back to watching the movie? Yikes
oh...oh you beautiful people. God dammit, I'm paying full price for this one, aren't I? Excited for tomorrow.
I am so curious if Bioware will finally shut down after this game. The talent is gone and it certainly shows.
We've had one dragon yes, but what about second dragon? Don't think he knows about second dragon pip.
Reminds me of the DAI Dragon bosses that were such a pig to bring down xD
Get woke go broke  bye bye Bioware
I just came to read the comments, before the freedom to comment gets restricted :)
It’s probably a nunbinary dragon
Can I ask if the dragon identify himself maybe as a "Non binary miltary helicopter" ?
Bioware for dragon age origins:  Sten: Why are you here? Leliana: What do you mean? Sten: Women are priests, artisans, farmers or shopkeepers. None of them have any place in fighting. Leliana: I have no idea how to answer this... Sten: It is not done. There is no more to it. Leliana: Do you mean your people have no female mages or warriors? Sten: Of course not. Why would our women wish to be men? Leliana: What are you talking about? They don't wish to be men. Sten: They shouldn't. That can only lead to frustration. Leliana: Sten...no, never mind. Let's drop this.  Bioware for this piece of garbage: non-binary quanari is unironically a thing.  The things that made this game don't deserve to be called human.
Crap game, dont buy it. who will like to play feminine rpg? Gamers are not inclusive, we are sociopatic and fu dem!
Now I understand old Dragon Age fans when they were complaining about Dragon Age 2 and Inquisition ( Inquisition was pretty decent tbh ). What the fck is this?
Hahahaha this is the studio that made Baldur's Gate 2! What is this God of War BS? I haven't checked in on this series since Origins. This is pathetic.
Rook - Female, Elf, Rogue, Antivan Crows🥰 Coming for you blighted dragon & old gods😎
What is this voice acting???? These reads are AAAASSSSS.....
Remember when this franchise was an RPG?
Why does the main character look like Angelina Jolie? lol
OMG this is finally happening !
Seems awfully low number of soldiers for a dragon.
Jobs are at 🥩 buy the game, the clown freaks are intiteled to your paychecks, they are commies
i loved it
The heads look so weirdly sized
i identify as non-buy-nary
I've been debating on buying New World,  or waiting for this,  so far money leaning towards this
great trailer, can't wait for this, day 1 purchase for sure!
so what in store for our saved files and our story from the past till now ?
the voice acting is horrible and unbelievable, and the gameplay looks monster hunter 2.0, but with a party.
Comments about the art style are like"why cant this game look like shit just as Dragon Age Origins? I cant take it seriously with those cartoonish graphics that are absolutely amazing". Like, the visual of this game is incredible and people are saying that it looks bad because thry want every game to look the same, "if its not photorrealistic its bad". Its because of people like this we have so much bad games coming out, because they want realistic graphics instead of anything else
Wokeshit aside, i think this pretty decent game. Im gonna pirate this 😎
Well, that's another $60 saved. Shame, I used to like Dragon Age back in the day....back when it didn't look like Fortnite with swords.
I thought about it for a long time—Dragon Age or Sonic X Shadow Generations—but in the end, Sonic won. Sonic always wins.
I love how in this medieval fantasy world that every civilization and species is multi-race and genderfluid just like San Francisco. These morons can't help but insert current day bullshit into everything they touch.
Terrible....This is basically Monster Hunter gone woke.  Guaranteed flop.
Looks like a steam sale for 9,99 :D
Again... why do the faces look so damn cartoony?
4:02 shows me why I will not buy this game  They couldn't even be bothered to design a per-class animation for the cutscene?  Hopefully this one turns out to be a loss loser
Am I going to need a 4090ti pro founders edition super clocked liquid cooled GPU to have the same experience?
Those cut-scenes look janky as ever. Great to see they haven't really improved in that regard, we couldn't have improvements happen to a beloved franchise.  So far I've seen, bad to mediocre dialogue, less realistic relationships, and a worse art direction. The combat looks decent I suppose?
income is not needed from the game, money for development was received from sweet baby inc
Dragon Age : The Wokeguard. No fuckin thanks.
woke trash
BIOWERE ITALY TOTAL BOICOTE THIS FAC*** SHIT
I love Taash's green horns
How misguided the Dalish were…
I play War Dragons this looks good
"Sir, a second dragon has hit the Towers."
"Second dragon!"  "This is getting out of hand. Now there are two of them!"
There’s no way you’re gonna gain as much goofs with your trans scar options as you lose.  LOL, I hope everyone who works at BioWare has been saving for the last few years because you’re all about to lose your job.
Lame af
Dragon Woke: The Failguard. Oh what ever happened to Dragon Age: DreadWolf 😢.  My favorite game has gone woke and broken.
This looks like a phone game. lol
𝐆𝐎 𝐖𝐎𝐊𝐄 𝐆𝐎 𝐁𝐑𝐎𝐊𝐄. As an old DA fan, I will never ever forgive you for what you did to the Qunari + the worst Dragon design ever 🤮 call "Sweet Baby Inc." to save you when you go Bankruptcy
Watch dragon age orgins trailer….. then watch this garbage….. sweet baby strikes again.
THE ACTUAL GAMEPLAY WAS BETTER THAN THE CLIPS ! cant say thats a bad thing tho! haha
Your DEI inserts are insulting, and heres the harsh truth.  It does not matter ONE BIT how good the writing or story or graphics may be. This could be mechanically and story wise the best Dragon age game ever made. Heck this game could be better than RDR2 and none of that effort would matter.  Why? Because you ruin the game with your self inserted politics and DEI agenda; and gamers wont buy that anymore. The games over, the cats out of the bag. Consumers do not want this trash.   We all want Quality games that focus on being FUN not having MESSAGES. And you will go under making trash like this.  It actually amazes me that investors and share holders arent up in arms demanding all these companies make REAL games and not destroy their own profits by insulting gamers. I mean a big part of this is your fiduciary responsibility to make the most proffitable product for your investors. And you are ignoring that responsability to make woke trash that looses customers and good will. im amazed any company is even allowed to think the words DEI after the last hand full of years of utter disaster for the 'go woke went broke' companies that clearly show massive losses.   But all this has come to a head and people are tired of it. but its chill, these companies will just hemorrhage money until they collapse and hopefully from the ashes a real studio will emerge.
Sooooo you guys ruined my favorite franchise? I almost hope your studio falls for this one. I just feel bad for all the small people just doing what they're told, that are going to lose their jobs because of this trash game.
Did Disney buy dragon age? OR Do I have to wait for some realistic or DA:1 graphic like mod?
This feels like  being a fan of Peter Jacksons Lord of the Rings franchise and then watching Rings of Power.  It just doesnt feel right.
That teleport is nice. One of the best features of Neverwinter's control wizard and something Diablo4 really missed the mark on
🤑
there are spiders in Baldur’s Gate III, the sales figure even beat mass effect 2
< watches entire video > ….. NOT enchanted.
This has sweet baby written all over it .
WHY IS IT SO PURPLE?
Why so cartoon graphics? I saw gameplay and reminded mee at gow
The 'female'  characters look and speak very masculine....I guess thats the new player base they are going for.   Not a fan of the graphics, preferred the first game, that last seris have been very  asian feeling whereas the first was darker and in some ways more realistic. Im guessing someone likes Disney and Asian style games.  I might buy this in 5 years when the price comes down and its in the bargain bin on steam for under 10 euros.. but nothing more
Why have they changed the Qunari into Handsome Squidward?
Its funny you can be flat assed androgynous elf with top scars but cant be a big chested hotty with a nice round ass? I mean I thought you people were suppose to be inclusive or is that just pretend its really all about you and your insecurities and its all you can show in your work? Ill pass this game aint for fans anyway
it actually looks pretty fun
I shouldnt be surprised it looks like a 5 yo made this, I guess we have dragon-age 1.
This game looks to colorful abd not grim like the situation... fml origins we didnt deserve you
I like what I'm seeing of the new combat system. I just hope we get to see some of the other classes in future gameplay trailers.
1:45 Hogwart legacy ? xD
I'm so happy to hear that Ali Hillis is back in a major Bioware production. It's been a while since her role as Liara T'soni.
I’m so excited for this game’s story after the way Inquisition ended. Curious to find out how the new combat will feel, but I’m cautiously optimistic nonetheless. If they can deliver a good continuation of the storylines with Solas from Inquisition with the gameplay not feeling completely foreign then I’ll absolutely replay this multiple times like I did the other three games. People are so negative for the wrong reasons sometimes. There is some cause for concern anytime a sequel to a beloved series comes out. Of course we don’t want a series we love to turn to garbage, but if you actively want this game to fail then you weren’t a fan to begin with.
n
this is stupid
What did I just watch lol. This is the trailer? Looks like a mediocre fan vid
Dragons are ok, but what kind of spiders does the game have? 😅
My Thoughts on the game so far:  I have alot of concerns myself too. But the biggest reason im holding out and wanting to play the game is because of the continued story from inquisition with solas. I want to see that story hopefully come to a satisfying close. I really hope it does because i dont feel like waiting another 8 to almost 10 years for another game. I still have the next mass effect to look forward to hopefully releasing if its not canceled by EA anyway..🙄   Nevertheless,  The fact that Harding, my favorite ginger dwarf Is finally romancable, makes it the canon romance for me.😍  I dont mind the action combat. Just hope theres some nice post game content or NG+ etc. I just pre ordered the "rooks coffer edition" with the physical copy on ps5. October 31st cant come soon enough.🙏  I am upset at the slidders though. The butt and chest sliders suck.. i know women who want the options to make their characters have big butts or chests and cant cause of how limiting the options are.. they talk about inclusion and yet refuse to include options for plus sized women with big butts or chests. Its quite hypocritical and sad..🙄  I also am upset at the lack of choices. But i can see maybe why they made it 3 choices. They chose the 3 that would have the most impact for the story they want to tell. Its what i think anyway🤷‍♂️   Though id like to know who the romance options for the choices are..  I completely understand why people feel the way they do. I am worried about the game but want to play it for myself to form a proper educated opinion by the end. I would say if this game does fail, mass effect will be in great danger i fear.. ive been a bigger fan of mass effect than DA. So that game for me will be the deciding factor in wether or not bioware is dead as a studio and that i wont care anymore. But ill wait and see what happens to that game.
it looks bad, the game was not made for fans of the series, it became populist and that's why it will be the biggest failure, sweet baby I wish you failure and I know that it is already coming true :)
There are those who have doubted, who have forgotten. But it has always been our duty to remeber. In peace, vigilance...! In war, victory...! In death, sacrifice...!  This.... Is not Dragon Age.
why is there 0 audio mixing, all of the voices sounds like they are in a studio, no echoes no bouncing off walls, it sounds like they are all in the same small room
damn visuals are so good and last shot looks absolutely delicious! can’t wait to play this game
Not a big fan of dragon age series but im even lesser fan of this graphic style. Game looks childish
The graphics looks like a downgrade from the last. Why did they have to make it almost like a cartoon. The dragons in the last one were more realistic. This looks like you are fighting a mean version of Pete's dragon.
This guy at 1:14 looks sexy. Will I be able to romance him instead of that granddaddy-our-companion?
I finished Origins today for the first time and now I'm playing Awakening and honestly I want to play Veilguard...
This sucks!!!!! we cant switch MC the Tran dragon hunter looks like it could have took it down solo why we where rob this!!!! to promote more gayness in video games.
1:59 voice acting works well, looks very cartoonish though. What was this pause fade out in a trailer? did you cut out the boring gameplay in the thing that is supposed to get me excited? XD Maybe when it drops to <$10 i'll try it out
Animation is almost cartoon-ish..   the gameplay clips make me thinkthe developers have been playing fortnite too much.   This is not my Dragonage...
The dialogue is so stock, did anyone actually write any of it or was it just lifted from a pile of cliched lines?
I'm officially stoked 🤓
Nah this ain’t dragon age lol
The battle looks boring...  And ... according to the information that I saw about the Worldstates...you are respecting....I mean, ignoring my choices from Origins and DA2 and even most of Inquisition.   So... what happen then to my Hero of Ferelden?  What happened with her mission to cure the Wardens from the Calling?  You are going to Weisshaupt and nothing of this will even be mentioned?  If I left Hawke in the Fade....what happened to him? Is he alive? Is he dead? Varric is not even going to mention his best friend?  If Morrigan or my Inquisitor drank from the well....will that be addressed or not? Will it change something?   My Inquisitor is a human male, he obviously didn't romance Solas. So that means I am getting less content than the Solasmancers?   As someone who plays this game since Origins I find this very disrespectful.   Especially I wanted to know or even see more of my Hero of Ferelden, and you will treat her as if she doesn't even exist?   If this is a soft reboot what's the point in keep being invested in this story, is not my story anymore.
WOKEHISTAN
That looks AMAZING. Can’t wait to fight those fallen Elven gods. I wonder how they become the dark spawn 😮
No es Dragon Age pero lo amo! ❤
Bring it on. Looks great.
Nice another hack Slash =\
how can after the first flawless game they keep getting much much worse like this ..huge downwards spiral
I  see agenda - I skip
WTF....
world of warcraft lol
Dragon Age Origins... absolutely amazing. Fell so in love with that game. Had to play all the stories. Dragon Age 2... Meh... it felt so irrelevant from the first one.  Dragon Age Inquisition... I played it once, beginning to end... and I'm pretty sure I blocked it all out of my memory. I remember feeling like they turned the entire thing into some... console comedy. Nothing about the story felt genuine or sincere or even interesting. Now... now they're coming out with ... whatever the hell this is. I don't think so.
This will review terribly you heard it first!
What a let down. This does not even look and sound like Dragon Age at all. This is even worse then Dragon Age 2.
As I've said before You guys are making a mistake. If you do stupid things and cooperate with the woke guys, you will face difficulties and you will fail from this. Give Chinese and Korean companies the opportunity to replace you. All because you guys did it yourself.
is there top surgery scars for the dragon? because u know there are two dragons, so surely one of them are LGBTQQIP2SAA right?
if u want,pls make a Dragon Age The LGBTQ. the LGBTQ group will rule the world!
"Your battle has already lost"    exactly EA
You guys remember dreadwolf?
Okay so the character models and environments look pretty good, but then you have the spells and effects looking like they were done in Unreal Engine 3 or something.. What the hell Dragon Age come on.
their heads are so damn big... why
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Get woke, go broke. Woke sh*t!
This dragon looks soooo cartoonish. Remember Corypheus's dragon in DAI. Miles better than this shit.
remove dragon age from the name
haha no money for you them/they! nonbinary dragon age 😂
this game just looks bad on every level. mobile game graphics (I don't see much difference from Inquisition, which was released in 2014!), unsuitable visual style (more like LOL Arcane, not Dragon Age) and music for the game world, zero innovation. what is the TARGET AUDIENCE of this purple game? sims fans? fortnite fans? lol fans? lgbt fans?
What have you turned this series into and and what you yourselves have turned into? No self-respecting fan of Dragon Age O and Mass Effect will want to buy or play this purple thing.
Can’t wait to see @ClashingwithAdagon unleash a lot of salty tears when this game fails.😏  I’m happy this game and the Dragon Age franchise is never on a Nintendo console.
The fact that mages aren't rooted in place sold me. Was leaning towards it, until I saw how mages play.  25 days until release!
This is what we love da for. Hopefully the company would adhere to core fans. Bring back the feature where u could swap characters mid battle. It will alleviate many concerns and make gameplay more fun
Why does every single character look like they are ready to be on the front page of Vogue, even after fighting a dragon?  These plastic looking character models are horrible. Dragon Age needs to be dark, bloody and gritty. Not Barbie fights dragons.
Main reason I am thinking of getting mage or range specialization is to be have a wide field of view when fighting big bosses
Woke Age
I like President Trump, he will correct the mistake of the weak
All my hopes for this game has been dashed. Looks like a silly cartoon game - absolutely ridiculous!  The dragon looks like a runt puppy from How to train your dragon.
3:39  seems like the character gets torn apart, curious if we see this in game. Im not sure about the combat it seemed dragged on, and the characters seem to barely do any dmg at all. I want to give this game a chance so hard, but the none 3 choices option really is making it hard. Seeing some of your choices having an effect on the world around you should be a given for a dragon age game, even if it is just a kodex entry. And dont give me that "new players"... there are default world stages for a reason.
Is there no lock on or did they just forget to use it during this video? Half the dagger and orb attacks missed because they weren’t target locked
stoked about the wardens, but what about antiva?? maybe zevran comes back?
Как это плохо
Ugly looking characters, weird artstyle, dogshit looking UI, no blood magic, Qunari look like Disney characters now. Seriously Bioware? This is what we waited 10 years for? At a glance it does not look appealing at all and to me it just reinforces why games like Balders Gate 3 and Final Fantasy reign superior over your games and others like this. Good luck guys. I'll pass on this one.
Omg, why all of this look SO cheap and lame? The game will be just as dead at launch as Suicide Squad. Don't want to learn from the mistakes of other companies? Well, remember that you have already created the stillborn Anthem. It's time to come to your senses and stop destroying a company that was one of the greatest 10 years ago.
This looks awful and pathetic. Inquisition looks 100 times better. Wokeness destroys everything...
This looks bad
yall seriously resorted to bots for likes and comments? cant wait for yall to lose hundreds of millions , this looks like pure garbage
Damn this looks really good ^^
I'd rather fire up my Xbox 360 and enjoy Dragon Age: Origins. This is probably great for the new generation 🤷🏻‍♂️  How difficult is it to come up with your own IP instead of infecting everything we used to love about gaming with the Sweet Baby Inc virus...ffs the state of the industry these days. One can only hope EA gets the Ubisoft treatment as well. Vote with your wallet's kids, games can be so much more.
This looks so.. boring. Nothing  unique looking here.
The game industry has been sickened by people who think that all things diversity are allowed. Games infected with the sweet baby virus lose a lot of money, lose a lot of freedom, have to make ugly characters that no one wants, include homosexuality, ignore the times and be racially sensitive.
The fight is looking pretty good! As involved if not more so than Inquistions which is perfect
the graphic looks like shieet.
DEI detected 💀
Such a terrible visual style.
I wasn't a big fan of the visual choices for Inquisition, but I'm aftaid the visuals in this one look even more wrong 😭 I do hope the writing is going to be better
I was expecting that with only 3 skills the mage combat would be dull, but this display somehow managed to go even lower. And while I have enjoyed many games with somewhat ugly graphics, there is no way that I could enjoy a game with a dull gameplay.  You get a large ugly and boring boss that has zero special skills and a ton of hp, the only thing that it does is to poke you and your mates with its head. The boss is situated on a flat lifeless surface (zero interaction with environment, and not even passive obstacles in the way).  So you jump around and shoot it with your little staff with small weak fire balls for 5 min until it just goes into a cut scene. Now a normal mage might have had some interesting skills to cause spectacular damage, disable or weaken the enemy, buff and heal their team mates. A good environment might have included some flammable gas coming out of a rock or something else to use to your advantage and to make the fight interesting...but not this mage and not this environment and, sadly it seems not this game.
I plan to buy this game, but seeing this trailer. I think I just gonna pass. This looks like a cartoon game
Goty is coming🎉❤😮
Всё равно вы купите
😂😂😂😂We just improved the inquisition a little bit.
DA inquisition looks way better 🤔
The only blight I see,  is the dei taint ☝️
What the fuck is up with these bot comments? You‘re telling me every other upload got rightfully shit on, but here everyone is positive about it?   Bioware and EA shamelessly faking good reception wtf
Looks like a bad game
So you just wack at it until it gets bored and just fly's away like a Jackass? that sounds fun.....
DOA DEAD ON ARRIVEL
It's so, so awful scrolling through these comments and seeing all this hateful, entitled and reactionary tripe, a portion of which I'm hoping is just actual bots. I'm sure it's happened before but I've personally never seen a game in the lead-up to release with such a vocal subset of people so eager and gleeful, literally foaming at the mouth, to dance on its grave before it's even released, before they have a clue what the story is and how it will play out, and acting like they basically own the franchise and the developers OWE them exactly what they want, or else they deserve to be dogpiled.  Absolutely revolting behaviour. Based on a lot of the comments I'm convinced many of these morons have never even played the preceding trilogy and if ever they have, not for years and years because a lot of what people are shitting on here - voice work, art style, presentation, gameplay, etc - is classic Dragon Age and Bioware fare, what is shown here is directly in line with the style and presentation in Inquisition. This shit is getting pathetic.
Camerin Wild -"Burning the games industry to the ground. "
I CANT WAIT
I'll pass on this one.
this is greatest game in this years, so LGBT+
Concord with dragons
I have socks that feel more like Dragon Age than this. Maybe get back the people who knew what they were doing and stop hiring rookies that make mobile games in their grandma's basement.
I seriously cannot get over how horrible this looks. Sure, the style is a choice, but that doesn't excuse the animation. I've seen mobile games that look better, smoother, and more polished than this AAA title. Mobile games. Things designed cheaply to steal as much money as possible...are given more care than...this. It looks like a joke. The graphics? Could run on my old phone. The animation? I've seen better animations on twitter made in a weekend. The gameplay? Oh god, you're just constantly dodging and pretending to play a game. I'd rather use QTEs so there's no lie about "playing".   What happened? What. Happened.
This looks like something you'd find on an after school special for teens.  God awful on every level.
I think this art style is better than origins or inquisition. They were fucking ugly characters. The only one that had better style was 2. And everyone "hated" that one too.
So when will they make the dragon age the dread wolf  a som more dark fantasy and And not this cartoon and new character creator So my choices have affect
I dont see a problem with the game looks great combat looks fun graphics look clean this why developers dont make games now you guys complain about everything how we throwing opinions before the reviews and people actually get they hands on it
This looks amazing!
If 👏 You 👏 Launch 👏 Without 👏 Previous 👏 Choices 👏 Mattering 👏  Then 👏 You 👏 Killed 👏 Dragon Age 👏  That is almost 100% of the draw of Dragon Age and Mass Effect.  If you do this, you're a bunch of morons. No, us consumers aren't morons. The ones who continue to refuse to listen to us are.  Looks like you're about to kill Dragon Age like 343 killed Halo. Wake up and listen to us ffs.  R.I.P. All the good game franchises that are dying.
I never played Dragon Age before, so I don't understand the critics. Looks and sounds awesome too me, love especially the interface.
Why does this look like two steps down from the dragon fights in Dragon Age 3? The dragon design sucks, it popped out of that tower stupidly, got hit by a ballista that was conveniently placed so close to it and predictably did nothing, and the entire battle just looked... lazy.  I wanted to give this a chance but God, this just.. I mean, it's terrible. It's not the worst but it's far from good.
Oof. Lower popularity than obscure indie games on Steam.  Love to see those agenda pushing degenerates lose 100% of the time.  Closed wallets doctrine, men! We will bring balance to the hormones once again!
3 choices , what a travesty.
I can already see "SHILL UP STRONGLY RECOMMEND DRAGON AGE:WOKEGUARD" 🙂
Lucky for me my expectations were already very low.
This is not christ like
Art style is TRASH! Why does everything look like its from fortnite? What happens to the style of Dragon age Origins? Plus why are there surgery scars in this game but you can't even create a women with normal size breasts and butts?
PLZ remake Mass Effect 2
who asked for this? how did we get from realistic and dark strategy fantasy game to hack and slash colorful mages that all look like goblins?
Сейчас впервые прохожу origins. До этого никогда ничего не смотрел, не читал, и настолько позабыл что бывает что то кроме "да, нет, сарказм" что прям кончаю радугой. А трейлер этой игры, ну...как трейлер игры 2024 года))) вы удивлены что-ли? Я вот нет
Bioware 2004 > Bioware 2024  Thank you hyper partisan social and political activists posing as game developers for killing off one of my favourite studios.  May all the “tourists” see you to the unemployment line.
Why did you get rid of the keep? What the hell are those 3 choices? Two of them don't even matter to me at all. Why is one of them who your inquisitor romanced?? Out of EVERYTHING, THIS is one of the thres that matter? You're such liars, don't make the game if you don't respect the fans and the series. Goodybe Bioware.
Вы разучились делать игры. Здесь плохо ВСЁ. Кусок инклюзивных фикалий.
Centurion: Sir, I suggest you look at the other dragon. Baltar: That's impossible! Centurion: No, it is a dragon.
OMG BioWare why?  u F with mass effect and u made that abomination of andromeda so u destroy 3 games in one go, then u make Anthem another abomination now u decide to F with your last game, wp. u will fail and EA will shot u down and i hope all  of you will never work in gaming industry, you shod be ashamed of your self, you are the laugh·ing stock of gaming industry
Just heard about previous game saves not carrying over to this one.  They just keep piling on the reasons to avoid this crap...
full of bots, this is ridiculous
Eeeeeeh Maybe Soo far this trailer/gameplay kinda be disappointing  Like what happens to trailers, old trailers and others series' trailiers where dark and has mood to it  Just hoping the game itself is worth the title of dragon age And graphics personally dont mind but the artistic style is kinda theme of everything we do is badass and we can do everything
Seriously? It took the studio 10 years to make the design of the dragons and the fight with them worse than in the Inquisition
GOTY
Какое убожество
This game not worth your $70, i can guarantee you this game is going to fail when launch, therefore just wait until they discounts the game to buy it. Its going to be like Anthems all over again, that game is less than $10 😂😂😂. Make this Failguard the last nail in the coffin for Bioware 😂😂😂
More Woke games, lol. First fable and the Dragon Age.
Did Gil summon Darkspawn FROM THE GROUND?!?!?!?!?!
Rip
Lmaoo don't buy this trash
No wonder the writer of dao and most of the early dragon age series just called you all idiots and tourists
man i know they are not rockstart but come on , u fighting dragon but terrain is not at all affected , water remail still 🙃🙃🙃... this is end 2024
Lmao even the mage is hack and slash, so lame.
Dragon wok transgard 😂
The wokeguard.
Followers seem to suck ass.
DAO was the one and only REALLY good DA game. This looks like it's going to be the worst one
Da with Awakening: Yep, DA2: Yep, Inquisition: YepYep, Books: yep, This one? Passing but maybe next time.
Dragon age. Chopped up boobs edition
Go woke, go broke Otra franquicia destruida...
This is the death of Bioware. After the failure of Anthem, they have decided to ruin one of their most beloved franchises with absurd decisions that only appeal to activists… Fortunately, Baldur’s Gate 3 ended up in good hands and was saved. Dragon Age didn’t make it. RIP, Bioware. You were great.
Hey! Can you say BOYCOTT? I can, to all things BioWare!
What have you done to the dragon designs? The traditional look from DAI and before was so good; these look like mutants. Gameplay actually looks good though.
Hmmm character design is not terrifying.   The gameplay actually look like an upgraded MMOrpg. But, the gameplay looks fine.  This game is like .... good but does not have  Wow effect
Watered down Hakkon?
bro imagine being a grey warden and dying in a 1v1 against a ghoul...that shit is so embarrassing wtf
Складывается ощущение, что скоро мужских персонажей вообще запретят. Одни женщины в ролике. Сильные, независимые, с явной отметиной повестки на лбу.  Играть в этот треш уже не имеет смысла
9.9 K of bots, nobody would like this woke shit
Top surgery scars yay! Now you just need to add people with physical and mental handicaps. Some gender neutral stuff too. Everyone know that's what sells!
ciekawe czy będzie dubbing…
I decided to buy the game only because I still have faith and hope that the satisfaction and joy the previous Dragon Age games gave me, i will be able to find again in this new chapter.  Unfortunately, for now, my desire to play it is mainly driven by curiosity about the lore, because at least I want to know how it will end... but Bioware, what on earth are you doing? And I'm not even talking about the graphics or stylistic choices (except for the look of the Qunari which... oh my god, please) which I don't mind, but seriously, we can only select 3 choices made in Inquisition?  I'm not saying to include every tiny and insignificant choice made in the past, but at least regarding Hawke/Alistair, the Well of Sorrows, Morrigan's child... all choices I made in the past because I thought they were important, and now nothing? I understand that the market evolves and you need to come up with something to attract a broader audience, but you didn't need all of this. Dragon Age was already an inclusive series that brought so much satisfaction.  If there is criticism, it's because Dragon Age has clearly created very high expectations, and those expectations need to be respected.
rip dragon age rip bioware 🤮🤮
Graphics are Ok I suppose. But the combat looks underwhelming (basic and not challenging)
Damn, the artistic direction is so ugly, i just can't take it seriously. My brain just can't imagine a world looking like this where a broodmother happened. Some idea are really cool, but everytime i see a character i feel like watching a kid's show. And I watch some kids show ! I just don't expect this when i think to Dragon Age.
I really wish they just bring back our Warden (HoF) i feel like story wise he would have been in Dragon age inquisition and especially Veilgurd there are ways he could be canon and still alive
So many dislikes 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Another Concord and Outlaws
Why are the heads sooo big @.@?
What are those ice effects at 3:05??? Little cartoon snowflakes? How cheap is that? This game looks at times so cheap and amateur ...
The more games they make the worst it gets, ugly characters, weird enemies, the first dragon age had a good story with supporting character that felt real, then Dragon Age 2 well let's just say all the reason for the first game was discarded to show case dark magic. then the games name is Dragon Age with no dragons except in this trailer finally some dragons. Well I bought the first few games, and this one is not getting any of my money. Because I'm just a tourist and after the rusted ME3 with no ending that made any sense I have not spent any money on any for there games.
this new dragon age video game looks like it was created for a different video game and not  dragon age I'm very Disappointed in it 😟😟😡😡😤🤬🤬🤬😠
they have ruined the dragon age video games with this new stupid dragon age video game p.s very disappointing 😔😔😠🤬😡
The new mage mechanisms is just horrible , they must redo it because i dont find it fun and stable comparing with DAI
9.9k/8k  all the recent comments are negative, all the comments praising the game are bots. do better Bioware, be better. all we want is a fun game, stop preaching at us with your agenda and shoving in our faces every chance you get.
Who prefers to play in tenth time DA Origin instead of this ....?🤦
Shit game
This game will flop so hard! Already people trashing it.
God of War Veilguard
Concord 2.0
This is one of the worst trailers I have ever seen. Wow ….. when do they call dragons with horns and the dragons look awful. The hi awful, no blood at all wtf?
All the wardens had their genitals removed by demons.
What is this shit? People can forgive all DEI shit if gameplay is GOOD, but not...somehow u fucked up literally EVERYTHING. This game is dead on arrival.
Is this like a new Indie game spinoff? Looks like a Sims expansion
I won't buy this game
I think this looks pretty decent. Hopefully the RPG elements are there, thats all I really care about. Graphics, artstyle and combat, while impactful usually take a backseat to good world building for me.
I have to ask, is the crossbow ever going to come back as a weapon? 😳
Why are the incels so sad and butthurt over this game? if you don't like it you could just move on and go do something else, but they are absolutely obsessed.
this dragon doe snot even look threatening, looks like a big chicken
GARBAGE.
I have to say modern american accent doens't feel right in a mid evil setting game
If only less woke
The more I see the trailers, the more it looks like an interactive movie rather than a game :(
Extremely worrying. Ingame, the infamous Mass Effect Andromeda had the same graphics (and partly the same game mecanisms now that I think about it). Bioware hasn't evolved after all these years?
0:49 supposedly she was going to fight the Dragon, supposedly she is an expert.   1:35 She ends crawling like a coward running for her life.  "Just you and me" 😂  Who wrote these dialogues? They are absurd.  And Rook ends fighting the dragon, technically, alone as your companions once more demonstrate how useless they are as in every gameplay video uploaded so far.   This game disappoints me more and more.
Way too many females screaming for it to feel epic. Adding one back in the day had a david vs goliath feel, but making it the normalcy is just ridiculous.
This game can eat crap and die. Thank you for saving me some money for a better game.
Looks mediocre at best
why do all the female characters look like they are dudes. they all have no chest.
What pronouns does the dragons use?
Excellent! Now play your own inclusive garbage dump! I wish your studio a speedy closure!
We grew up with Rayman, Super Mario Bros., Metroid, Castlevania ,etc.  You expect me to raise my children with transexuals, homosexuals and crippled degenerates as their icons?  Nah, I'd sooner start drawing eagles on my body.
Loved DA Origins, liked DA2, DA Inquisition was OK....but DA the veilguard looks awful on so many levels...I will never support Trans agenda pushing nonsense... the sooner EA understands the customer is never wrong, and 90% of their customers are against this agenda, the sooner they start making profits again. Simple really
I thought this was dragon age,not a raid shadow legends MMO 😂
ok so something i noticed with Veilguard and i hope other party based rpgs do this is that during really big moments like hunting that blight dragon your entire party is with you during the cutscene until the fight. I love that unlike in inquisition when you hunt a dragon for the first time or do the big grey warden mission some party members like iron bull comment like they were there but i didn't take them with me. Little things like that i love.
This looks dope af
YT options:  Top: shows 1.1-9k liked comments... buries reviews.  Topics: AI generated topics, does not show anything that is negative, just neutral or positive.  Newest: I scroll and I see more negative comments about this horrific and damned game.    Results: Want the true comment section? Look at "Newest" and scroll.
Combat looks so disappointing, what a shame.
SJW, DEI, BLM, ANTI-FA, LGHDTV+ hogwash.
This is what happens if you order your Gray Wardens at wish. They go full armored with shields and everything against a little dark spawn ghouly thing and get just wasted instantly. What the hell, Bioware. What the hell..
This is like Dragon Age Origin's "special" cousin. Too goofy and *whimsical*, but they share the same family name lol
To all those who write here in the comments to talk negative about this game, why the hell you don't go somewhere else since you don't like the game? This game might not be the best compared to all the previous Bioware's games,( but I don't judge since it has not been released yet). But now the critics about this game are becoming more annoying than the game itself.
Yeah sorry. Looks too modern for a Tourist like me. Pass.
Hopefully this woke DEI ridden piece of trash flops like the other woke games recently. sick to death of gaming being ruined for men
modern games are completely ruined with the DEI crap. i’m a straight white man so I won’t be buying your game as i’m clearly not the demographic, dont blame white men when your game doesn’t sell well though.
i am SO excited, can't wait for the release.
Grey Wardens > Stormtroopers
Pathetic.
Why does it look like a ps2 cutscene
looks bad, all of them are unattractive, there are so many women too, the game play was meh
Just cancel this game its not to late and it will flop
That dragon looks like it grew up near a nuclear waste dump. Poor thing. Someone needs to put it out of its misery.  But, hey, it reflects the state of this game perfectly! Perverted into something unrecognizable... And don't forget! Only 3 choices, guys!
Oooo...still don't know how I feel about that UI.  But dam, that was cool!
That combat looks really tedious. And the art style is a shame. Too bad, I sense the story underneath might be half decent!
This game will be a disaster.
I think I'm not "modern" enough!
Qui in Italia non siamo scettici , siamo inorriditi da questo scempio 😂
I really don’t like the art direction they decided to go in. 😢 it looks too much cartoonish, like it’s made on unity engine. I'd even be happy if they stuck with the inquisition styled graphics even tho it’s old by today's standard.
It’s wild watching old videos of DAO and Inquisition and seeing how far what used to be an incredible franchise has fallen. But at least they have top scars yall!
Ehm.... i think i will cancel my order and wait for reviews.... Throne & Liberty as MMO looks better
Sex change and surgery scars in a supposedly mediaeval world 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You really did kill the spirit of Dragon age. Shame on you
Is it just me or this game got downgraded? 🤣 Come on EA.....
I enjoyed Dragon Age Inquisition but I will be passing on this one.
Why does it look like a Sims game😂. This is Kingdom of Amular all over again
after play DA1, 2,3 the most my favorite is the Dragon Age Origin. i really like the gamplay and the story, its really change from DA3, to DA4. most remember carracter are varric, Morrigan, Allistar, and Solas just because he's a bald elf :DDDDD
WOKE!
Is this fake or is this actually coming out
En unos días espero reservarlo 😘😘😘😘
Is this shit a frigging mobile game?!?
They are wearing armor and using swords, and yet it doesn't give a medieval vibe. How did you mess that up?
This looks like shit.
I wonder how hard will the modern audiences will support this game.
Who is gonna play this game, 4 year olds ? Because with this shit its only them who will play
Just compare the dialogue and voices in this game to basically any other fantasy game. Here they speak like regular, dull, modern day people, while in any other fantasy game they speak in an old-timey or foreign way with interesting dialects/vernacular, which is kind of essential for immersion in a world like this. The Witcher, Dragon's Dogma, Baldur's Gate, Skyrim, Elden Ring.... these are just a few examples of fantasy games where a lot of thought was put into the writing to make it feel authentic. Everything about this game just screams low effort, half-baked garbage for weak minded dummies who lack critical thinking. Not a trace left of the old Bioware.
After reading the latest news about this game, which says that 99% of the choices I made no longer matter (only three matters, two of which were made at the end of the DLC Trespasser), because the developers need a "clean slate," and after watching this gameplay video, I realized that I'm too "tourist" for it.  It's sad for me to say this, but I'll be honest after everything I've seen abaut this game, I want Dragon Age Veilguard to fail because it's not Dragon Age but for some reason it's called that. After that, I hope to the studio will return that people (if this is possible and BioWare hasn't been closed yet) who love Dragon Age and made it the wonderful dark fantasy that we loved it for and will declare Veilguard non-canon. After which they will make a soft reboot of the series, starting with a graphic remake of the first 3 parts (while preserving everything we love about them) and completely remake the 4th part, making it a cool plot and tactical battles like in Origin and transferring the consequences of the player's decisions like in Inquisition. And this Wokenessguard will be forgotten as the nightmare of the Dread Wolf.  But unfortunately, all this will most likely remain just my wishes, and in the end Veilguard will simply fail and BioWare will simply be dissolved.
This is going to go down as the worst dragon age game, its overly cartoonish, made by a team with no understanding of the franchise, devoid of passion and creativity.
want to return to DAO time. can’t look at this … 🫥
Dragon Age? Wtf? F…k bye
what fu*k is it?
This looks like a great Warcraft multiverse  experience. I wish they'd bring back Dragon Age, though.
I hope you guys added bad way. In Dragona age Inqusition they tryed shut fucking down my Inqusition I want them kill them all but I didn't :(  I hope you some dark way I want to be a new god In Veilsguard.
I think i saw two males in this trailer. Couldn't be sure as i wasn't able to ask them personally.
I hope this game tanks HARD
Gotta bring back the dislike numbers this a L
Look How They Massacred My Boy😢
I hope Bioware ends up in the same place Volition did with Saints Row.
DA died
Errr, okay. I guess this is not made for me.
I'm not part of the modern audience so I'm not entitled to buy this.
Full Woke/DEI game , Hogwarts Legacy is better
Why does everything have to look like freaking fortnite, dude? I swear....
The heads. Fix the heads. And also if only you could completely redesign this big forehead, smooth qunari look. 🤦🏻‍♀️  SPOILERS: cannot believe you only gave us three choices relating to the past games (only related to Solas) and got rid of the Keep?! Even as a Solavellan this is extremely disappointing.  My Warden being queen and searching for a cure for herself? Who cares! Alistair/Hawke possibly dying or surviving in the fade in Inquisition? Who cares! Well of Sorrows? The Divine? Morrigan’s son? WHO CARES!
Is this Dragon Age for gay toddlers?
Female dialogue sounds abysmal  "Strong female characters" oh how original. This is trash
Looks corny, reminds me of that game where you play as a sneakerhead with a talking bracelet.
How can a game made in 2009 (DA:O), with far more hardware and software limitations, deliver a much more realistic and grim battle atmosphere than this game? LMAO. Holy hell, those Darkspawn aren’t even close to being scary.
Looks promising
I've been waiting for this game for a decade. I see a lot of Mass Effect 3 and Andromeda influence, which I love. I have a feeling this game is going to be a WIN for BioWare and EA.
Wtf is up with that dragon design??? It looks like something from How to Train your Dragon!
Graphics and mechanics look like 10 years old. I think Inquisition has still better graphics.
The game looks horrible. I am also disappointed in the script writing based on what I've seen so far, looks like an americanified PG 13 version of Dragon Age... Harding and Bellara sound annoying. Bellara could have been made better like she was some mad sniffing lyrium veil-jumper for her powers kind of jinx style from League of Legends but instead we get cutesy winnie the pooh who you can't take seriously. It's genuinely annoying.
this game gonna flop like yo momma fat a$$
i don't why i didn't remember about it until now since it's such a big part of the DA universe, but where the hell is the chantry at? i haven't seen any chantry stuff in any of the trailers, gameplay, etc. maybe i just missed it but feels like it's been removed from this game
I just can't get my head around the lack of gritty violence and gore, the atrocious androgenous characters, and the direction of the story departing the lore that made the previous games so interesting. I just don't like any of these characters except for Varric and that's not enough to get me to buy the game. And I can't leave out the horrific reworking of the Qunari that just look like shmucks with fake horns glued to their heads. ACK!
Ah yes, grey wardens ,where it dont matter there was ever any warden hero of ferelden or if you made blackwall a warden. "Dragon age" game, where all we care about is, who did you f*ck in DAI , if there is inquisition or not and if you want punch Solas from the planet or want to save him.. all the other things? Nooo we dont care if your Inquisitor drank from well of sorrow or Morrigan did, we dont care if there is any Kieran, who that even is haha, so Morrigan is just a cash grab for the nostalgic players. Your choice dont matter! This is our game!  - Bioware propably
I really wonder who are those people who going to buy the game after this and previous trailers?
What a boring and bland game... poor video cut and awkward voice dubbing.
So this series died with origins, word.
Let's defeat a dragon in 10 seconds! A fight against a dragon used to be exciting, now it's boring!
Deeeeeeaaam.. but you know what's a real advance?... Trans Scars cuz it doesn't matter if a fcking dragon is about to destroy the world, you would be more interested on changing your fcking gender you fcking hero hell yeah Gay Age: The Trans Guard FCK YEAH
The characters are so ugly and off putting. Is that intentional?
The head of everyone looks stupidly big
Looking like a big pile of shit. RIP Dragon Age, this is not a DA game.
Stocky af charas look shit, all races look the same, flat af body options, only 3 previous choices matter, troons everyhwere you look, ugly characters everyhwere. I hate what you have done to my fave franchise. FY! Over a DECADE and you shat all over the fans.
So much for those dragons we see in the trailers being archdemons
I don't care what y'all say this shit looks great! Can't wait to be back in Thedas. It's been too damn long.
WE CAN ONLY IMPORT 3 MINOR CHOICES FROM PREVIOUS GAMES I HOPE THIS GAME FAILS
MAKE THE CHARACTER CREATION DEMO TRANSFER INTO THE GAME 🎮
Woke shit, the original talented developers left long ago
It's hard to be excited about this when Inquisition was already so mediocre (in my opinion, this isn't a view all people share I am aware). This just looks... bland.
kidified
The companions do like no damage lol
This will be another failed product. Under the policies of domination Woke's
I'm 100% buying this game!!!!! whe it goes on sale for 9.99$ so maybe in about three months XD  it's sad to see the company that gave us inquisition and originas make such pivotal mistakes with so many things. I've always been a fans of their storytelling abilities and their world building as well, but it seems that their DEI quotas just went up and they're more focused on trivial things such as the pronouns and their ESG score. Honestly it's very sad since origins is one of my favorite games of all times and seeing the company that created such a masterpiece go under is sad. but i'm betting on the OG designers and programers to create their own company once they get fired or the company goes bankrupt and then we can start getting new games with higher quality.
After looking at the Character Editor, I'm wondering what is the dragon gender. Hahahahah. No. No thanks. I will skip this title.
This just looks so horrible...
The Combat seems so weird and comical. Graphics, Mechanic, everything is just...*meh*
the only dragon in this game is nutz across yo face
Architect, coryphaeus , and new It seems to be one of the magicians.
What's the gender of the dragon?
Ah yes only three choices!
What a disaster
Woke alert
The Elves will pay for this
Whoever decided on this art style has cost them 100s of millions.
Shame another DEI failure on the way…
Drag Queen Age Will Fail Hard. There, fixed your title for you. You're welcome. - Anonymouse
This looks terrible. Oh my gosh... This game is going to bomb HARD. When it does.... I want EVERYONE that defended this to stay off the internet from now on. Mage moves look horrible. The fact you have to PAUSE the game to change out spells and such... Just stop. Fire the entire Team. HIRE GENUINE and ACTUALLY GOOD AND EXPERIENCED devs. YOU LITERALLY HAVE TO PAUSE THE GAME TO SWITCH YOUR MOVES. LMAOOOOOO   INQUISITION EVEN HAD BETTER FLARE on the spells than this! Holy crap... 60$ for this garbage? I'm done trusting you gaming companies.
that muscle bro walk tho at 00:22 is not promosing. Was there a choice for choosing feminine or masculine animations or is it shared across all characters?
WALLET CLOSING, OPPOSE DEI DECEPTION. After watching playthrough's of the previous Dragon Age games i got excited for the new version, Today i can tell you that i am no longer excited, the game looks like a clownish rip-off compared to previous entries... I'm not playing this freakshow, everyone in your game has a "Bongkonkel". (nasty Caribbean slang for hydrocephalus)
I wonder how many bots will actualy buy this game, since modern audience is non existing...
Why to many bots commenting?
That horn looked so g@y if this game have those weird genre ideology I will pass
It’s hard to keep a straight face when I see how goofy and cartoonish the Qunari look now. Combine that with all the new weirdo ideology being pushed and I’ll just pass. I had hoped that Bioware would turn things around but they are truly lost and aren’t coming back. Oh well, there’s way too many better studios now.
Looks like Disney + Fortnite with mobile game UI.  Plus I bet there will be woke USA stuff.  I played origin, 2 and inquisition. Origin was the best followed by inquisition and the 2nd one was worse for me. This one, it is a skip on looks alone.
Dragon Age: Funko Pop
I can't wait for the Dustborn crossover DLC!
Dragon Age Ultimate Bobble Head Addition
im sure modern audiances will save it and play this  presales doesnt look good either hard pass on this one i rather play origins again unsubed too
Go woke, go broke guys. Have you seen what happened to Dustborn? Or Concord? I guess you have ton of money to waste...
This gameplay reminds of of a Kamala Harris speech.   Looks & sounds good to those of lesser intelligence but is just zero substance to anyone actually paying attention.
this looks so kool
This game looks horrible
The devs ruined the qunari so that they could make ero fan fic about them
lmao imagine deleting real comments
Love dragon age, hope the focus of this game was the animation and the story, not some weird political agenda they wanna shove down people throats
BInary Age : The wokist guard. Withouth me i hope the game will not sell well and you go bankrupt like Ubisoft.
God, this feels so lacking in tension, ingenuity or scale. Look back at the Dragons in Inquisition. Those things felt freaking mighty and powerful. But this thing is just ugly and forgettable.  And did they literally turn darkspawn into fucking putties? Not enough balls to introduce a broodmother, eh?  Along with the most boring and lackluster dialogue, I don’t see a single reason to buy this game. Think watching this vidoe is gonna be my last showing of mild interest.
Dragon Age: Failguard, Ooh Exciting. . . . . . . . .not! lame🚮
Another woke lgbtq woke ,,masterpiece,,
Excited to see female bodybuilder muscle mommy taash! Shes badass with a phenomenal physique!
Bunch of people hating without giving it a chance. We’ve waited forever for this. At least give it a shot. I think it looks pretty good. Like a mix of God of war and inquisition. And I loved both games.
Excited. UI. Can't wait. The bots are all saying the same thing.
Sucks that they went woke.
I loved the older Dragon Age games, sad to see what it has become now.. doesn't even look like a Dragon Age game at all. 10 Years waiting to get a mobile game with disproportionate characters, and don't even get me started on the Qunari. I can see The Veilguard failing hard.
I am really trying hard to like this but with this graphics that looks like disney dream valley and there so much purple on screen i just cant and it so sad cuz i loved dragon age inquisition :(((
Meh... 🫤 Wokeguar.  Useless mans, ugly womens, pathetic design. 👏  Glory hole of Sweet Baby Inc 💩
Everyone looks like a goblin in this game!
Gameplay looks good enough for me. As long as they keep the woke sht to a minimum, I will play it to the end.
Why are there mastectomy scars?  And why are their heads gigantic?
Woke age
Seguro se podrá cortar y agregar órganos en el editor de personajes
An ugly game made by people to whom beauty is anathema. Baldur's Gate 2 had more impressive dragons.  Don't listen to me though. I'm just a tourist who played the original trilogy multiple times and even liked the anime.
Is Ghilan'nain suppossed to end us by laughter or why does she look so funny and goofy? "cOnSumE tHeiR fLeSh 🤪"
Trash  in a cup of soup
Me da mucha risa la Qunari estilo Barbie jajajaja ¿Cómo se vería mi esposo Iron Bull en ese estilo de porquería? XD
The monsters look pretty good. The faces are kind of weird on the characters though.
roo la vache que c'est moche ......... les persos sont immondes .......... les graphismes ......... la laideur absolue ... au moins espérons qu'il plaise au 1%  #LgbtYXZ123/flaque d'huile  .........  de la planete........... c'est lamentable ce que vous avez crées  .  mais bon au moins 1% des gens de ce monde seront  fier de jouer que entre eux......
Go woke go broke the golemos. 😄
Your shit editing can be beaten by Lucypyre's editor   Why are the warriors coming with bucklers and shortswords at a snail's pace? The gameplay is still the same from Dragon age Inquisition  Who the fuck gave these people money?
David Gaider wants to wind his neck in. And would you please stop talking nonsense?
Damn. The Qunari doesn't look like a Qunari. It's more like Queernari of colors. Remove the horn and you will see it. The agenda tarnished this game all over.
This makes Andromeda look good and talking before the graphics patch.
Man well there goes this franchise!!
Wel this is DOA
This is a Bolders Gate 3 copie and paste
PLEASE SCRAP THE GAME AND REMAKE IT, NO ONE WILL PLAY THIS WOKE SHIT
The animation looks crap, not excited for this at all.
😂 is their any butt plugs in DLC
What have y’all done to this series??? This looks like garbage compared to Origins.  Wow.
This game looks like trash, Dragon Age Origins is the only good one
Looks alright, but i would expect a blighted dragon to look more...undeadish
tbh kinda dig this trailer, hope the game will be good with long term support. at this point people are just hating cus they aint got shit to do. though its reasonable to to be cautious since u know ea and bioware and stuff soo, fingers crossed 🤞
prouds and fearsome qunari became f@ing soy drinker. The graphics became a violet Disney cartoon. The Dark Fantasy became a fable for childrens. The more I see this CR@P the more I hope that the responsible of this ABOMINATION will be ALL fired at once.
Glad to see the wardens are completely useless
Is this the surgery scars game?
I'm not getting this game because they wouldn't let my character have bottom surgery scars.
I used to love this series and bioware. Now it's utter woke garbage. Stop pushing top surgery scars and pro noun crap. RIP Dragonage RIP Bioware.
si es para gente lgbt pues que lo compren ellos, yo no, paso🤢🤮
bot likes where's all the positive comments..they think we are stupid!
Looks last gen.
Looks like trash. That battle looks like it took three hours real time to complete. That's too much for even interesting gameplay. Why did they make the main character so ugly. That's not how you sell things.
Characters and dragon look pretty ugly if I’m being honest. Any chance these graphics are going to get fixed before launch or is this what we are stuck with?
this shit visually just doesn't look good from 2024 from a known big studio. I really hope that beginning isn't CGI and that is in-game
seems kinda cartoony and goofy. I hope it's not as boring as it looks. there's like no gore or wicked looking skulls or anything
Why do the Qunari look so stupid 😭
Why are the heads so fucking big? And why does the dragon look round and cherubic rather than angular and dangerous like a reptile predator?
Absolut Woke piece of boring Shit. Bioware next fall after ubisoft . You won‘t make any Profit with the so called modern audience and their crap of Rainbow flags
No respect for old fans, learn from sagas like Zelda, TES , Fallout ecc.... Even the new 'diverse' FF16 is more respectful for the fans.  This is pure trash.  Bye Bye new Bioware.
There are only three Dragon Age games. This is an abomination. Stop ruining our beloved franchises. Thankfully Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 isn't too far away.
How utterly awful this looks. But hey, what do I know? I've only been playing Bioware games since 1998, I'm just a "fucking tourist".
This looks like a mobile game 💀
what's with the ps2 era graphics?
The Failguard is such an appropriate name.
You lost this tourist's money
Thank God there just happened to be a huge, flat open area nearby. Heaven forbid having to do a battle and deal with obstacles and terrain....
Combat looks awesome apart from the "pause" or "slowdown" mid combat. But all the health bars on trash mobs are really immersing breaking. Hope the characters feel better "ingame" then they do on youtube. Not really feeling much connecting to them so far. Something feels odd about them, not sure what it is yet.
Why is this shit in my feed? I put this game on my ignore list after the first trailer. There is no way I'm ever playing this game.
Nicee graphics and game play. Would have been perfect if Cullen or more fittingly Blackwall was commandeering his old Wardens. Would have made a great storyline progression. The missing nostalgia is going to bother me annoyingly during the cutscenes
how much can you fucking spam that dodge? with those incredibly coreographed movements, another fuckin incoming hit indicator and such generous dodge times even going into slowmo occasionaly i hope this is being played on "games journalist cinematic" difficulty, otherwise this is looking like its going to be unbelievably pisseasy... also not a fan of that skill menu limiting you to only three abilities at a time... and the dragons heads look a bit big especially the first one's
Amazing how after 15 years, Origins still looks and feels much better than this woke crap.
looks like something straight out of a disney movie
I'm tired of seeing women
Gameplay looks extremely similar to inquisition except a lot smoother which is good. Also it looks like there might be a dedicated "dodge" button now. That should go a long way toward making the more action focused gameplay feel better
Dragon Age: Shadow Legends 😂
Holy moly, 8 years development for this? A game that looks like something from 2014? I guess 6 years went into hair styles, pronouns and discussions about why the character editor allows for surgery skars, but not normal female bodies. But at least every companion is "pansexual", something a Dragon Age fan really hoped for..... 🙄🙄🙄
Woke shit
The sad thing about this is: I actually really do like the graphic style, in my opinion the game looks fantastic. Normally this would be an instant buy for me, without thinking a second about it. BUT: I refuse to buy anything anymore that is built around an agenda. We had enough of this in the last years and now it's time for this to end. I don't want to support a game that promotes double mastectomy, it's an insult to all survivors of breast cancer. I don't want to support a game that excludes all female players who want their characters to look like them, with totally normal female curves. There's nothing bad or evil about a women who looks feminine, this feels like anti feminism. I also don't want to support games anymore that are extremely political correct all the time, because that makes games (and also movies and TV shows) so unbelievable predictable and boring. Everything feels so soft, no one takes risks anymore in western gaming. That's the reason why i (and nearly everyone i know) is mainly playing only asian games anymore. I hope Bioware survives the release of this game.
2011 Skyrim's Dragon is a masterpiece comparing to this shit  and Do I have to talk about Elden Ring ! Even Dragons in DAI are far more better  Seriously Bioware !! What in Andraste's name are you doing ?!!!!
I’m so disappointed with the art style. Compared to DAO, or DA2 it’s much more catoonish. While the characters and environments might be more “colorful”, they feel less realistic and immersive. It looks like with each installment, there's been a gradual decline in detail and overall quality. It almost looks like fortnite or an Asian mobile game, the characters simply lack proper detail, and the rocks, flooring dragons just simply bad. So bad sometimes it looks like it was rendered on a iPhone 7. I can't help but wonder if this decline is due to BioWare being under pressure, as it feels like they're taking shortcuts and catering to a different audience.
They sure erected that arena fast, good job the dragon knew to land in it, the dragon design is just as bad as all the other character design WTF is up with it's stumpy head? It looks more like a freakish bird chick. Are the companions even doing any damage?
Geez that dragon looks like trash.
BOTS DONT BUY GAMES BIOWARE
I don’t know how to explain it, but even the dragon looks like it has a Harris/Walz sign in its yard
Looks fire
This is the ugliest Dragon Age so far and it doesn't feel like a dragon age game at all. This is what you get when you put a Trans nutcase in charge? Trans wanna shape everything in their image. Good luck selling to handful of trans things. We will skip this game.
I'm too tourist for this...
Bioware only allowing three choices from past games to transfer to VG is absolutely horrendous. And these three choices only from the Inquisition DLC.  What happened to respecting player choices?! This is a incredible mistake. Making the keep irrelevant, and not replacing it just goes against everything Dragon Age fans loved about the series.   *Also, why was my comment deleted?
this looks awful
It looks like shyte
BioWare used to be such an amazing company…used to be.
Only thing I'm looking forward to is how much money they lose on this DEI crap.
ok so males are still idealized, but women have to look like shit? idk, it looks as if a team of body dismorphia dudes dressed as women are working on character design
What wouldn’t surprise me is if Ghilan’nain was the one truly behind darkspawn. Either they were the monsters she made before that she was made to stop making or she continued her experiments in the Fade and passed on her new creation onto the Magisters Sidereal
You guys might want to start looking for a new job lolol
even the music is mediocre...
😂 the voice actors are really bad 😂   1:00 Wardins Ridy baleshtash! 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
lol
Why does the dragon look so bad? Why are all the characters so weird looking and big headed? Thanks for letting me down after waiting years.
Still a massive let down. Neutered combat, watered down from DAII standards. Some cool cutscenes though. Too bad I won’t be buying it based on vibes alone.
How to train your Dragon Age. All the people who designed this, quality checked it and signed off on it and not one of them said something like “maybe we should make a design.”   You all just went with the Poundland Toothless idea.  What’s your next game?  Sense of right team of America land.  With Burtman, wound woman, supermanuel and many more.
When you play, it WILL NOT look like this. Keep in mind they removed the entire player UI to show you this gameplay.
Damn, the best thing you can see in this game is the design of the armors (Wardens...)
all these bots in the comments
Why?
Interestingly all the criticisms were deleted and out of nowhere it jumped to 9k likes. Sadly for Bioware bots wont buy or play this game
If my eyes could vomit.
Just found that only three choices will matter: did our inquisitor keep or disband the inqusition, who did we romance, and if we vowed to save or kill solas. That’s it??? Nothing about saving Hawke? Did our warden survive? Did our warden continue as a warden or become the ruler of Fereldan? Bioware, you had access to the tool The Keep right there. RIGHT THERE. WHY did you ignore this tool that was sold as something to help us carry our choices over from the past into the future? This better be fixed in an upcoming patch. Our choices are what makes Bioware BIOWARE.
be aware this game is discriminating women with large breasts.
Are the dragons gay with surgery scars too?
Im not into the gay sh*t. You alleviating a lot of customers catering to the rainbow brigade. This game looks so Pussified.
Dragon age: DEI guard top scar edition
The dragon is gay?
The chance that those likes aren't botted is as fat as the mOdeRn AuDieNce that the game is catering to. It was getting ratiod and it now has more likes than dislikes? It went from 2.2K/4.6K to 9K/5.7K, what a joke 🤣
gameplay looks decent but god I hate this new art style...
Dragonwoke failguard
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
dragon fights were my FAVORITE challenges in Inquisition, and always gave the best rewards. combat here is already looking smoother and faster paced, so i really cant wait
I WON'T BUY A EA GAME EVER AGAIN
Let's see: over 130k views and (only) 9 likes?, yet the comment section seems to be filled with people rimming the hell out of the devs and game in general. Gee, something is amiss for sure, but I just can't quite put my finger on it 🤔🤔🤔
I will pass on this like all the rest that have been stuffed with WOKE politics. My cash will stay with me.
Still not convinced this will be any good. Also, why is it more expensive on console than PC?
Don't give them any of your money.
one of the things i love seeing about Veilguard is the expressiveness of Rook in the face compared to the other player characters in the Dragon Age games.
Concord Age
Is this going to be the game that finally kills bioware?
It seems Bioware is no more, this living corpse need to be put to rest along with Ubisoft .
Is Bioware aware that all their thumbs up bots don't actually buy games?
"Fuck" this game i played the originals 1st one being the OG. I was subscribed for years to this channel but not now. I was hoping for a Dragon age game to finally "fucking" top DA origins. But under current developers this wont be possible. Because this is the game that EA will kill Bioware. Pretty gay video, watch the original Dragon age origins videos. With only 9k likes this game wont be selling well.
Can't wait to see this die like Concord did xD
thats one fat Rook without an ass or boobs.  also why does Trash has nigglet facial features?  guess they want to say that nigglets all have horns like devils.... Balista propped up in close quarters? do the developers even know what projectile even mean?
Look at all this wasted time making this instead of a dragon age game what fans wanted and no one can convince me this is dragon age it looks more like concord 😂
i won't even be a tourist for this game even if jack sparrow ask me to.
this is the first gameplay i'm seeing of this game. based on all the youtube content about this game I was expecting much worse. good luck, Bioware, ball is still in your court with this one
Looks lame to me.
cringe lvl over 9000
The qunari in this game look like short bus smurfs with horns, I can't get over how ridiculous it is.
Cringe cutscene and ugly characters. No buy.
Outside of the fact that everything looks so small in this game, why did the dragon breath fire...and nothing got caught on fire like the WOODEN STAIRS 3 ft away
Lmao, most of comments are bots. wtf
I can't unsee the head sizes.
Dragon Age: The Pronounce guard by BioWoke, another special DEI, LGBTQ and Woke infected game for the new modern gamer we can add to the collection this year! Where are these modern audience gamers? They simply don't exist. Why do these game studio's keep hiring LBTQ/DEI consultancy companies like Sweet Baby Inc. etc. to ruin their games. I mean, Star Wars Outlaws, Flintlock, Dustborn , Assassin's Greed Shadows, Silent Hill 2, Suicide Squad and Alan Wake 2 to name a view, are all Woke infected games that bombed or gonna bomb. Just stop inserting DEI/PC politics into your games and start making good games that focus on gameplay and non-woke storytelling, like for instance "Black Myth Wukong"!!
Why does it all look wrong?
Dear Gaider, the anti woke mob does need to sit down and shut up.  That being said, modern problems don't require dragon age solutions.  Modern cultural and social issues being forefront in a medieval themed universe seems out of place and is a disservice to the game and the groups it wants to represent.    Social issues aside, the game looks watered down and bland to us RPG purists.
The combat looks like dogshit idk how anyone could see this and be excited.
DRAGON AGE DIED WITH ORIGINS...PREPARE TO FAIL.
Oh god this looks worse than inquisition in every way.
Ah dragon age the massive flop edition.
This gameplay look awfull, hard pass for me.
Mouai elden ring à des combats de dragon plus épiques
Just started playing Inqusition
Your game is going to flop and you have no one to blame but yourselves.
Woke garbage. Stop cultural appropriation from the black comunity against norse culture. Disgraceful.
So do you ever take damage in this game? That fight looked pretty easy lol
It's really too bad that every single executive attached to this game has some sort of mental illness. I truly loved this franchise, and they've run in straight into the ground. I hope it fails miserably
So, according to these idiots, tourists are people that have played the games since their inception, not those that are happy and  just now playing because of virtue-signaling and dipshit, woke ideology? You won't sell many copies, and you shouldn't
Looks cool but holy cow that voice acting is terrible.
This looked like trailer for 2007's game. 😅
Bioware: We may not care about your previoud choices but we give you double the dragons!
A lot of Bots in the comment section of this Woke Garbage.😂😂
I want to play as a buxom big banked elf princess 😂..
as a fan of the series (even a second installment) it's hard to be excited about this one. Vibes are just off... This fight is more like a raid boss in Wow - just sits there and makes a move every so often. Lame as hell...
The gayme must be broken even the dragon is cartoonish and not scary.
This game is like a 70$ dirt and broccoli milkshake!  It will sell very well in some trending places in New York or San Francisco. because they are large cities full of pretentious rich leftist.  But try to sell millions of 70$ dirt and broccoli milkshakes all around the world it will never happen.  This audiences are between 1 to 5% of the population. Even if you manage to make the best dirt and broccoli milkshake in the world, your audiences will never go above 10%! People don't want this crap even if some other minorities like smelling their dirt and broccoli farts so much.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣ugly like a hell🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Comments are bots. First name, last name, 4 numbers.
There should be a gameplay option to limit gay interactions.
Every trailer makes this game look more gay and lame.
3 skills, targeting circles, npcs on a bridge. This looks more like League of Legends 2 than Dragon Age.
ish..... imagine seeing dragon age become this.... comon what is this dragon design. I have played all the DA games, loved all of them but this is one to forget and not even try.
What’s the like to dislike ratio?
Parece bem ruim
The characters are so ugly this is unwatchable, so disgusting.
What are that's dragon's pronouns?
So did all the elven gods turn to blighted dragons.
That dragon is transgender
Not a very good dragon design.. But why the HELL do they have SOARS on their bodies??? Looks like shit!  Or STDs
Bot city in the comments.
Why so much purple? Also it still looks too much like fortnite character models. It's so jarring.
I am soooo looking forwards to this game letssssss goooooooooooooooo flopping.
I feel like this blighted dragon belongs in a “Spyro” Game.  Not dark or scary, kinda funny and cute.
Been a fan since Origins.. This isn’t the same vibe that I fell in love with all of those years ago but I’m not here to attack those who do like it. I’m one of those who loved sitting in the tactics menu for hours or pausing every moment to move and position characters. Also, the general direction isn’t to my taste, but hey, that’s just what happens with different writers and directors.    For those who will enjoy this, have a great time and I hope that you have a great conclusion to the story.   As for me, thanks for memories BioWare. 😌
1:06 That's not how you play a horn. You don't wrap your mouth around it like all the characters in this game do with other things. You pucker the lips together to make a kind of raspberry sound into the horn
Is this a mobile game ported to PC?
I won't buy your WOKE game
rip bioware
wtf
This is not dragon age I mean your now a superhero with all of this crap what happened to being a regular human elf or dwarf taking on insurmountable odds but coming out alright by being regular knight this is not a good combat it’s just like having superpowers
I will definitely enjoy more than Elden ring, that game is ugly and boring. This game looks so nice and cinematic ☺️
Finally, a new Sims 3 expansion!
That is probably the most 2017 boss fight i've seen in recent times. This looks extremely boring.
graphic look like 2014 game. Congrat
A story-driven garbage dump with combat from stupid Korean action movies, a game in which NOTHING remains from the DAO ROLE-PLAYING game. 0 out of 10 for this piece of crap! Bioware has degenerated into nothing!
😂😂
Forget it, now I know the bs you pulled out with the World State decisions, what a disrespect to the original fans that play this game since Origins. Who built this world together with the Hero of Ferelden, Hawke and their companions.   You only care about pushing your own ideologies, about your non-existent "modern audience", about drawing new players who don't even care about this franchise and won't support it, about the people obsessed with the overrated Trespasser DLC, and the "Solavelans", while neglecting everyone else.   You destroyed the one thing that made Dragon Age special, and what made many old fans to continue being invested in the franchise.   😂 I can't believe that after all the red flags I decided to trust you once more after watching this video, but the funniest thing is that it only took 1 day for you to disappoint me AGAIN and make me disdainful of this game once more.   What a record. But good to know that I should avoid this game.   I GREATLY DISAPPROVE.
Seems like most of the comments here praising the game are made by bots 😂
That Name is so shit rook dafak
Looks pretty fucking cool
Combat look appalling and character/NPC design is cringe. What little can be discerned about story from this little trailer does not look to promising either.  I have a feeling this is going to bomb.
Hope we can remove the UI like in this trailer lol
Scepticism prevails since BW has laid an Egg for last 10 years. But it looks much less Fortnite-ish now. So maybe a good game from BW once again?
I still can't get over how ugly the art style/direction is.
This transition to more action based is mind boggling - you literally had a monopoly on the market with DA:O gameplay and here you are now doing a cheap knockoff of soulsborne games. Who the heck is this game even for? Definitely not Dragon Age fans
Not enough lessons learned in "Concord"? No one will be interested in these ugly protagonists! ! !
Any chance of a Legendary Edition? I have problems importing my xbox360 savefile
Hello, Can we choose the hero's appearance from the release date trailer? I'm specifically talking about this hero's appearance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8DkDQhPx2A&list=LL&index=3
I can't wait
Why even add the race quanri if you make them look so stupid, compared to the roided out mess they used to be
this is one of the mist generic and terrible looking games i have ever seen in my life , this looks like a fortnite event 😂
😮 your battle is already lost😮 just like the sales numbers of this game
Ugly game. looks like some Disney Pixar knockoff level of animation.
The heads are so freaking big what the heck
Ghilan'nain sounds terribly bland and generic. Just one more thing to be disappointed with.
Game looks so bad
Це параша, Ориджинс оце імба, вони чи висновків не роблять, я розчарований.
I was so hoping this being dragon age would not be yet another boring action combat game as all the others 😕   There used to be variety in rpgs
Looks fantastic. Keep up the good work!
This looks terrible, wtf happening with this game
This is what happens when you hire Trans woman as a director who previously worked on sims? 😂. Greatest choice ever BioWare, you are dead, rest in peace.
Is Gendermancer a playable class and can I use the legendary weapon Estrogenblaster?
As a dragon age fan, i want the story, the choice's impact and the companions done right. Nothing elses matters to me.
More dragons is always good
bleagh
Honey she's teasing you. No one has 'two' dragons.
This looks... incredibly fucking bad. Ugly, unfun, and cringe.  Your studio won't survive this disaster. And you brought it all on yourselves.
Your Majesty there's a second dragon coming!
nah, this aint it chief. literally looks like a mobile phone game both visually and gameplay wise. not the dragon age i became a fan of.
This comments section is all cope and woke🤣
I’ll never understand why I see so many people on social media giving this hate for being woke and having bad graphics. This game looks soooo good, the fighting looks amazing and it graphically looks great. Very excited. ♥️
It will be free on ea apparently & I will try it via cloud not installing, I’m going to judge ur game so hard I doubt I will get past 10 minutes of gameplay
I understand why you would remove comments with criticism, but im still disappointed
Looks awesome so glad i pre ordered it now
Loving everything, i hope the fighting feels visceral, like i want to go oof when i get hit kinda visceral.
D.E.I. Detected, No Wallet Found! This is what happens when Activists make a game instead of game developers. I'm just going to Play Dragon Age Origins instead.
Is it just me or do the textures not seem quite right? Realistic layered on cartoony? Adds weird perspective to some of the scenes..
I hate you BIOWARE. You destroy my favorite games
The gameplay wouldn't even be that bad, but because woke garbage is a no for me. When they're out of my games, i will buy them.
what a joker
https://youtu.be/KOxvEN4yLTs?si=TYMFYvKMK1G-1IVU
So many funny people in these comments. Dragon age has always been woke 😂
Oh cool everyone and everything is female. Welcome to 2024
Are here a lot of bot comments? They don’t read as if they were actual comments of normal people.
There’s one problem with this Davrin should’ve been here since he’s a Grey Warden fighting Darkspawn is his specialty. In a Roleplay and Gameplay point of view I would bring him on missions that deals with the Dark Spawn.
The design choice is not amazing ... the story may have promise.
More woke for the loss..
None of the choices from  DA:Origins, DA2 matter, they now mean nothing and only three choices from Inquisition carry over.....wow.
Dragon Age: Inquisition had more realistic graphics than your new game.  The graphics here are like in a cartoon, and it's sad.
I don’t like the art style but if the story is good I will play it
Can someone convince me on this game? I think it looks pretty cool but i haven't been able to get into any of the previous games because i never liked the combat. It looks much improved in this game but i'm concerned i'll have no idea what's going on in the story
RAINBOW AGE 4 : The GAY Guard
No more 3 companions ? Sucks
por que arruinan tod.. por que
This is such a downgrade from the last dragon age game, blurry models obvious plug in use, and why did it cut black and remove the characters and change the model on the dragon, and don't get me started on the dated combat system, I went back to look at the trailers from the last and wonder where it went wrong
Another woke failure, won't buy
Woke Age...
Still counting on that "modern audience" eh? Good luck with that 👍
They made the Mother of Halla an octopus with an extra pair of arms instead of creating an antagonist which aligns with her lore. And she's a redhead... She's supposed to have white hair and it's the first thing mentioned in her lore. She's a monster maker. They could've related her to Andruil and linked her to all the monsters that she created and favors by putting them in her design. Imagine her with wings, or with patches of fur. I keep getting that feeling that the writing is not going to be up to par and lackluster :c I'm disappointed again, it could've been so good.  "They say Ghilan'nain was one of the People, in the days before Arlathan, and the chosen of Andruil the Huntress. She was very beautiful—with hair of snowy white—and as graceful as a gazelle. She kept always to Andruil's Ways, and Andruil favored her above all others."
This looks like shit compared to the previous titles. Bioware used to be such an awesome game developer. But like everything else EA touches, it just continues to go to shit. Fuck you EA for ruining modern gaming.
who voices ghilan'nain cause she sounds SO FAMILIAR
It looks like fantasy jedi fallen order. We will see were this goes.
I still can’t get over the qunari look… 💔 I’m still skeptical…. I loved origins so freaking much and the dlc … DA2 it was too political only really 1 city super small and the choices felt insignificant. Inquisition was good just the stuttering i had a few crashes I liked the characters I didn’t really need a huge open world. After Andromeda I’m just worried about it being about live service and it not lose its heart ❤️
Why the dragon seems very weak or easy here, looks like a downgrade from DAI.  I hope it's just for pre real fight purpose or just for pre release videos, that some of this dragon's abilities are intentionally disabled. Because if it is not, then dragon fight in veilguard will be a serious downgrade from its predecessors.
Game is gonna suck, has none of the charm the other Dragon Age games have. Even DA2/DAI I was somewhat excited for.. this just feels .. like its in a flipping midlife crisis.
qeer soy dub/
Not impressed.. actually I’m disappointed. Goodbye dragon age.
Cicatrices de mammectomie, et ils sont contents , quand une femme atteinte du cancer est obligé de se faire retirer un sein. Croyez-vous qu'elle va jouer à ce putain de jeu avec une cicatrice bordel de merde
BOTS? OR DELEting coments? lett me screen this xD, ugly dragonkins
So there’s three choices being brought over from inquisition and that’s it. I’m sorry BioWare, I have defended this game and the choices made but this one lost me. I no longer recognize this series. I need to see some serious plans in place to rectify this world state issue in DLC or something because this is absolutely laughably lazy and a complete slap in the face to your longtime fans. Address this now.
so.. where is the gameplay, i only see fireworks and movies
The first time I saw mage gameplay, I was like. "Are you joking why so slow?" Then I see this, and I'm like... oh yes, that'd be me teleporting everywhere casting shit like a god 😅
Is all the storytelling like this?  Looks like DA for meatheads...
the only good trailer I've seen so far
Man, I was praying this would be the one to sell me on a franchise I've loved for 15 years...and it's doing absolutely nothing for me. Unless Ernest Hemingway wrote the script, I doubt there's anything that can get me to come off sixty bucks either. I can't believe I waited almost a decade for this slop. I wanted this to be epic; I got kiddie nonsense.
So : Hof , Kiran, Alistair, FEnris , ZEVRAN , Isabella e Hawke will not be in this game. WHAT A WASTE. And they will surely find a way to keep the divine Leliana/Cassandra from appearing
>Insert comment praising "Ghilan'nain"  I'm totally not a bot
I mean,  I'll play it but it looks like a weaker, boring version of the knight enchanter mage from the inquisition.
This is looking fire 🔥  Gonna be spending countless hours playing, can't wait✌🏿
gonna pick this up because its Dragon Age so of course I am but man Im a little disappointed they kept the ugly armor styles from Inquisition 😔 even the Blood Dragon armor that was my favorite in DAO and even ME is kinda ugly here in Veilguard, heck even the dragons themselves are pretty ugly 😭 but hopefully the story makes up for that
I’m gonna play DA Inquisition
Even spoiling the whole game doesn't make this shit any better. The more I see it, the more unworthy it is.
Good lord this looks horrible.
Bots in comment
is it just me, or did all the spells feel... i don't know, weak? there was no oomhp or visual "flare"....
ALERT ‼️ SWEET BABY INC. WOKE & DEI.
Why are the dragon so ugly? DEI?
Somehow you managed to make a dragon look worse than the ones from Dragonage Inquistion, which is over 10 years old
I don't know they have me on the fence right now I feel like this games either going to be decent or completely bomb. Personally I don't think I like this combat as much as inquisitions but I will save my full opinion until I actually play it.I don't intend to play it on release
Too many women in this game, sorry, it breaks my immersion. They belong at home with the kids.
Awesome.
trash
I know they are blighted dragons, but why are they so ugly?
I’m really eager to get this game, because I’m really into the series, the story, and the lore, and I really hope this delivers on that front.  I’m not crazy about the bobble head thing, but I can live with it.  I can even appreciate an unusual art style if  the gameplay and story is good.  I like the dragons in DAI better.  But these two examples are sick corrupted dragons, so….  I’m really hoping the character creator has more versatility than what has been shown so far.  I can see why it struggles with the qunari since there aren’t any qunari in The Sims.  (Sigh) I really dislike the term “woke” or it least the way it’s used these days.  Now it’s just used as a pejorative that really doesn’t communicate much.  BioWare has always made inclusive content.  There’s nothing new here.  Did the writers insert their own worldviews into the game.  Probably.  I guess they’ve admitted as much.  But they always have.  If it bugs me that much I have the option to pass on the game altogether, but since I can just not apply those features I’m not interested in, I think I’ll be all right.  Just waiting for Halloween.
We didn’t get Concord 2 for this!? Come on now, Sony. Understand your consumers better
I hope they will give us a trial to play of dragon age 4 when the game comes out please 🥹🧝🏽‍♀️💗
Yes the game has its problems but most games are not 100% perfect and i like more than i dislike here. So thank you to the team behind it. Looking forward to be lost in this world again.
VOY A COMPRAR EL JUEGO CRIMSON DESERT ./ IM GONNA BUY CRIMSON DESERT.
No
После высказываний "нечта", о том что все фанаты серии маргиналы, данная игра кроме бойкота ничего не заслуживает. Так что, желаю скорейшего провала этой поделки для мобилок, и закрытия bioware, которая заслужила покой.
Okay, the fighting is fine... but where are all the graphics? 1:00 and after looks like it came fifteen years ago.
Even the dragons are ugly!
IM GONNA BUY CRIMSOM DESERT.
I hope the story and gameplay makes up for it. The tower just looks so badly designed, textured and animated (when it collapses). It is half collapsed in an unusual way, staircase and bricks are randomly placed without the thought how realistic it is and when dragon blasts through, crumple completely ignores the brick layout and type of structure it is.
So one of the main strenghts of dragons is the ability to fly and another to shoot fire while flying. So instead of taking the advantage of it being inside it's lair and not able to use it's great mobility, lets bring him out where it can shower us in fire.  Genius
I'll be honest, I wish they kept the DAI dragon, it was interesting having to break their limbs and stuffs, not bad tho, just less interesting
You know, as a normal F'ing human being, just trying to enjoy something to escape my crappy life, I have to say: all this "anti-woke" crap is just as annoying as the "woke'" crap. You're all annoying. Go away. Veilguard isnt the first RPG that allows the player to make a trans-character if they want. Are you all just forgetting about Cyberpunk and Baldur's Gate 3 which allowed the player to put a peen on a female body and vise versa. Veilguard isn't doing anything that hasnt already been done before in RPG's. Get a life and grow up. Nobody is forcing you to play a transgender in an RPG where you make your own character.
30 fps???
From a real time tactical RPG to a full-on mediocre action game.
I want to top surgery scar now
So .... That's not an archdemon then?
Is there an auto battle option?
10 out of 10. Gameplay at your fingertips
10 woke-points from 10. go f away
Seriously though, fire the idiot made and approved the first trailer. This looks so much better. What were they thinking?
老玩家的我看到還是覺得不敢期待，每個人的頭都好大，整個卡通化，讓嚴肅的故事嚴肅不起來， 戰鬥機制把歷代以來的小隊策略完全丟進了垃圾桶，動作的部分看起來也十分無聊，像是歷代以來最把玩家當白痴的一作。
I can't have my traditional Dragon Age combat experience, but thank god I can make a character with top surgery scars. Priorities.
God, why did they decide to make this trash?
Solas be like:  “I suspect you have questions.”
Is that Torchlight 5? Lol what a damn joke of a game.
This new Guardians of the Galaxy game looks awesome... Oh wait... Oh no
WOKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.
Looks like some ugly cartoon game. Wtf is this
it looks like a  queet game this is not for  real men
So I feel like they learned from the feedback on the dragon fights in Inquisition. A lot of us felt really sorry for the dragons we were killing. Their sad noises, the way they would get injured, the way some were just sleeping minding their own business etc. They felt more animal than monster. THIS dragon on the other hand - much easier to want to fight. They made them more aggressive and monstrous this time around and i'm here for it :)
Sorry, but this doesn't look like DA to me.  Dunno,  feels fairly mediocre.  Will wait on public opinion once it launches.  Not something I'd want to risk a pre-order on.
Mother.
nice ideas, still i don't get why it has to look like Dragon Age: Fortnite.... i'm gonna pass on that one
This should have been the first trailer! It’s so much better than whatever in the Disney marvel shit the first one was
This is an improvement, but the head size and at times the head width to shoulder ratio desperately needs a fix
Superior music and sound effects and atmosphere just like the good old DA, but ultra turn-off for the Qunari facial designs.. what is this weak af teenage face..?
WOKE AGE THE VEILGUARD !!!!!
Combat looks like it's straight out of Hogwarts Legacy.
Looks good, but omg they did not do the Qunari righttttttt
Preco 👍
I love DAO. Inquisition was okay, though way too colorful. I was really hoping they'd go back to the roots. Great story, dark atmosphere, awesome characters, gritty medieval UI design. And then I see this :( A mix of WoW and Fortnite... Plus, at first glance, there’s no real graphical difference from older console generations. I’m definitely waiting a few months until it’s on sale. It really doesn’t make me want to play it right away :(
Dragon age is dead. WTF is this shit? Looks like a mobile game with Toy Story hero complexions. The dragon looks like its from Shrek FFS!  People comparing this to DAI...are you insane? Whats wrong with this age of gamers? Have the companies slowly destroyed your reality and eyes?  Seriously the game looks like it has no soul.
it's terrible, it's just terrible, it hurts so much to watch your favorite franchise get killed
Mein Herz in Flammen😍
Where are all the skills? what would it be convenient for console users to press X Y O A???? THEY CUT BACK ON THE SKILLS AGAIN, AS IN THE INQUISITION What kind of scary characters, it was better in Origin!
Shitting, crying, throwing up
PS3 GAME.
What an ugly game. The graphics are a SHAME.
Wow, This looks so great *beep boop! I can't wait to get my hands on this! **3:46** Mother of Monsters indeed beep boop*  (Not a fake comment *beep boop*)
I bought my copy the second it dropped. I can't believe it is finally happening!   Also...Ghil be looking beautiful and spooky <3
IM GONA BUY CRIMSON DESERT ELECTRONIC ARTS.
go woke go broke
People are complaining about this game and it's gonna suck. So far I'm stupidly hyped for this game. Looks so dope I will admit the qunari look bad, though
I swear, the entire sound design is drowned in Disperser and I'm all here for it
wow they made the wardens really incompetent and stupid. a balista right by the tower ? charging like leroy jenkins ? these are wardens not just soldiers. i see EA writers really hate the wardens
3:46 Well, I'm sure that guy is fine.    He's fine! Totally fine.
I shouldn't call this a trailer, more like game footage.
For all of the people still in denial that this game is no going to be infested with woke cult nonsense, I give to you a public statement from the game's own Director Corinne Busche;  "As a queer trans women, I have a perspective on games that not everyone has. Dragon Age has long been a place where LGBTQIA+ folks can see people like themselves, represented respectfully. It's inherently very queer, an it's such a rare thing for marginalised communities to have representation where we feel proud and powerful in how we are depicted. It's so deeply meaningful for so many. I often get emotional when I think about what it would have meant for a younger version of myself to see someone like her in a game, and as a hero, no less. I hope we can be a safe place for our queer players to know they are not alone."  This Dragon Age in name only game is little more than a platform for this radical zealot to preach "her" twisted ideology, at the expense of the franchise "she" has co opted from a desperate studio who has clearly lost all their major talent... This is a game made for "her" ego & not made for the fans of Dragon Age.  I genuinely hope this game flops hard and EA shuts down Bioware after this incoming trainwreck...
Is this a mobile game? oh... whoops.  Keep botting losers.
OMG! The combat looks SO much better with most of the UI and extra junk turned off!
The best game in the world is Dragon Age Origins. It's sad I will never see that game again.
Wow! Cinematics are great! 😍 Beautiful camera angles and all of that. Shocked in a good way 😎👍 That dragon feels like a real problem (in gameplay, I mean). Also got GoT vibes 🐺🌨 Waitin' for the last day of October! 💥🤘
Keep botting your comments, you pathetic losers.
So is this an ad for a mobile game or what
Yeah pls. this is a Pixar dragon.
boring combat,   idiotic dragon with no real attack
There's no Ghilan'nain. This thing looks kinda like Adeptus Mechanicus' creations.
IM GONA BUY CRIMSON DESERT ELECTRONIC ARTS.
Ship of Theseus paradox, but make it a Blighted elven goddess who's replaced all of her parts with body horror
This looks awfully bad. Why does it have Fortnite graphics? Why is the Dragon so ugly? Why does the Combat look so bland... sheesh
Aside from the characters looking Disney and some woke options in the character creator (that I can just switch off), the game looks great… I’ve been a skeptic and won’t preorder but I think I’ll be buying it soon after release
*sleep* then *wake up* at end of video. What did I miss?   I’d rather with Dragon Age Dreadful.
IM GONA BUY CRIMSON DESERT ELECTRONIC ARTS.
And don't forget to apply your top surgery scars in character creator lol piss on this woke crap.
Dragon age FAIL Guard Woke, friend of concord and wokelyte, we already know where this is going to end.
Если пошли на такие спойлеры, то дело дрянь. И да: 1) почему у всех белых женщин лица в веснушках (Хардинг, эта стражница)? 2) опять очередная "сильная и независимая" VS другая "сильная и независимая" 🤦
Such a shame it doesn’t have Multiplayer. Me and the boys would crush this game
Let us romance the hot guy who says "Wardens! Ready ballistas!" Why isn't HE a companion? SIGH!
Id better play DAO remaster instead...
Finally we can make a character with Trans surgery scars! I can always trust the folks at EA to cater EXACTLY to their target audience. I'm so sick and tired of being able to make hot characters. Flat butts and LBGTQ friendly is definitely the way to go!
Ugh here they come again smh
Amazing trailer. All this toxisity in comments will only help to make this game more popular. BIOWARE, great job!
Looking forward to playing the final dragon age game 😂
this looks good
Solas will save their asses. Mark my words!
ITT: Bots and paid shills glorifying some - objectively speaking - terrible dumpster fire... And Youtube shadowbanning all negative comments. I mean, I couldn't find any after 20 minutes of reading through the comments.   Bots and paid shills won't buy your game though 😂
Guild Wars 2 at 1,5x speed.
Looking good, most anticipated game this year for me.
guys is one of the Wardens Alistair or am i tripping
Ghil looks like an eldritch horror my 5 year old sculpted from play dough.  That's not a bad thing at all!  I just wanna know, WHO the other part of the human (elf?) centipede is below her.  I think this game is looking great and I can't wait to play it.  :)
Looks great. I am stoked!
braindead game
EVKA!!! ❤❤❤
No Blood Magic is a massive L
Se ve impresionante!!!
Lure dragon out of tower near multileveled topography. Battle dragon on completely flat and even ground. Profit.
Im giving them grace on the character art style (huge heads and rubber smooth skin) because i understand the history of this game’s development… they probably prepared assets and an art style for a live service overwatch-ish type of game because that’s what the EA exec’s wanted from them for years. If it’s too late to fix that, then i just hope they stick this landing to the point it overshadows these big ass heads.
They turned the game i waited for 10years too come out in too this woke disaster bioware you idiots will pay for this when the sales plummet
looks like WoW garbage and is not worthy to use the name dragon age 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
This looks so fun, I can't wait
i dislike that violet/pink schait!!!! please add a color changer option in the game!!
Everything is Purple, The Game
Trending with 86k views?
Mage in action,i have been waiting for this
This is what I've been waiting for. I've been a fan of Dragon Age since the beginning, books and all. This combat looks amazing, the detail to characters, perfect. I'm literally counting down the days!
Ghilan'nain looks creepy as fuck. Reminds me of the original concept art for the archdemon in Origins.
Shout out to the Wardens tho. They saw a blighted elven god materialize right in front of them and said ‘Fuck it, we ball.’
Why does it still feel like an eternity to wait!? I want it now!
I cant wait to get this game every gameplay look so bloody fun the mage with spells looks awesome🧙‍♀️✨️🤩.  When i get this game this is my first character Class: chapion build slayer. Race: Qunari. Name: Shao Kahn. Faction: grey warden.
So many paid comments praising this piece of woke trash 😂😂😂
A second dragon has hit…the age.
Это будет знаковый день для BioWare! Я верю в этих ребят.
comments are only positive until you sort by recent. Game looks like a mobile game.
I am so excited for this but why did they do the Qunari like that? They look so bad!
Dragon Age: A Fortnite Story :(
I. Cannot. Fucking. Wait.
I CANNOT WAIT to see what Ghilan’nain does to the people who said this wasn’t dark fantasy!
Broodmother prime broodmother prime broodmother prime
WHAT IS THE BLIGHT  HOW DID IT ORIGINATE (IN TRUTH, NOT THE CHANTRY LORE)  HOW DID THE EVANURIS COME TO CONTROL IT WITHOUT BECOMING GHOULS AND DYING  It doesn't matter if the game looks cool af if we NEVER learn about the most basic elements of the DA universe's lore  It's like playing Mass Effect and never learning anything about the Reapers, only that they're "giant destructive cockroaches from deep space"  Lore needs to make sense and the Blight has been a mystery since DAY ONE. What's worse, the whole first game revolves around it, we subject our PC to it, we learn it's a doomsday device - potentially being able to end ALL LIFE IN THEDAS - and we finish the game with ZERO clue as to what it is. Is it blood magic? Did it spawn from a dead Titan? A sacrificial rite? WHAT. IS IT  This is RPG. Players need to know the lore and rules before playing. So far, ZERO lore has been provided on the taint and the Blight. We're waiting, BioWare.
This looks AMAZING!
what a bad charakter design! the elf, its a woman? a men? the charakters are the biggest looser on planet earth
I feel this should've been the trailer to debut the marketing with. It's so slick! There's not enough for me to tell if this is gonna be better than the original DAO, but on the action department it looks well staged. I like the 'combo opportunity' too!
The way the dragon flopped in reaction to the attack was literally the most beautifully cinematic things I’ve ever seen 😭😭😭 I can’t wait to play!!!!
What’s with the bots. This looks like shit.
Bot comment #789: "Wow. This. Game. Looks. Amazing."
Horrible
Woke 🤢🤮🤮🤮
Wasn't it confirmed in Inquisition that Dragons aren't effected by the blight? Can someone clarify?
Cuts here, Cuts there, Cuts fucking everywhere
I'll pass and play kotr
"blighted dragon" yeah that's called an archdemon? why are we now not calling things the name they've had for multiple games?
2:23 my jaw DROPPED, this is badass
And after people said it's not dark fantasy...
Stop posting spoiler trailers -_-. Just a general trailer for the feel will do eh?
That looked boring af. Ive recently come to the conclusion that, the game play and combat are are hack and slash and not as thought heavy beacuse the devs didnt have the skill to make a combat system that is on par with even the second game. Garbage
Esta super sin palabras
You ruined Dragon Age!!!!!
This is certainly the best trailer so far. But the combat and art style still looks like plastic toys being smashed together
Cringe, ugly design and already downgraded compared to the first gameplay. This shit is going to flop badly, huh?
This looks awesome! Cant wait to play but there's something I'm consistently noticing.... the dialogue/writing seems to be very immature/amateurish. Like it was written by a bunch of socially inept kids with very little life experiences. I hope I'm wrong
woke game no thx
Already looking forward to the fan fiction that's going to be written about the warden with that mohawk-ish haircut👀
🎉🎉🎉 Void yeah!! Woo!   But also ... Why do I bother getting attached to Grey Wardens?! 😅
Long live the dragon born!!!
Sign in to confirm your age. No. No, I don't think i will.
Ok estoy dentro creo que lo pre ordenare
After seeing this... I'm really scared for this game
Just finished playing origins and dragon age 2. After seeing this gameplay. I’m going to wait a couple years until this is on sale. This is does not feel like dragon age. The gameplay looks extremely boring and repetitive. Damn sucks but after getting let down by Andromeda I should have expected this.
This is the most uninspired looking game in a good while. Nothing about this looks good.
Bioware actually thinks throwing in teleports and slow motion animations is enough to make fighting a non-reactive damage sponge fun.
Honestly its not bad. But They need change interface from mobile game
Total GotY
em....  i have only one complain.  Why is she speaking  English?  They were trapped for millennia   they should not be able to know this language   only  elvish   unless they could travel the fade and speak with spirits
Dragon's Age: the fortnight genshin guard  🙄
Okay, at least storywise I have to admit, that BioWare is still the No. 1 on the market (followed by Blizzard) in RPGs. But now I am confused. I always thought the elven gods were the 7. But now it seems that the forgotten ones are the 7 or the kin of the Halla godess. Theory crafters where are you?
Serious Question as to why bioware would commit suicide like this:   Ok,  you can have breast scars as a trans person in this game.. BUT, if your other options are to be a man or woman or whatnot, why would you choose the 'wrong' sex/gender?   I mean, is there a hormone clinic in the castle? What do they fashion penises from in a fantasy world?     Seriously bioware, this was your suicide song.  Every dev on this game can thank themselves for killing a once proud studio. And their own careers as well if there is any justice.
Wow i love how men are only there to fill the screen space. Women are the true MVPs in this world and this woke ass trailers shows it. LOVE IT. Who needs men anyways. LMAO  -- PS -- This is SHEIT.
Gamplay looks shity as fck. How you could regress so much from Inquisition. Hope this game flops.
The Dark Fantasy aesthetic is back with full force on this one.
Yay!!! Excited!!! 🥰🥰🥰
Dear new Bioware, you don't need to release anymore of any kind of trailer, gameplay or anything, people will not buy your game, they don't care about it, this is just exhausting at this point.
Ghilan-nain looks horrifying 😭 but also kinda 😳
Looks pretty good, not full retail price good but steam sale in 2 years good!
Not one sponge, but two sponge!!!!
Ngl combat looks *sick*
Mediocre. Why play this when other better games will be out. PoE 2 early access. Not to mention, Bioware is another racist company that practices DEI insane policies and the character creation shows. 😂
hmmm i can't help but to feel disappointed considering i just played dragon's dogma 2. the combat in that game is miles ahead of this.
Goodbye Dragon Age ! Play again when the DEI influence is gone!
hope we can custom companions face with mods
Glory to Palestine 🇵🇸
Why balista so close? Animation faces so poor.. but dragons cool and epic
Why would you position ballistas at point blank range!?
I love dragon age, but I hate killing the Dragons....🤣🤣
I wish I was excited for this. These Cartoon Network looking characters just don’t connect to the DA world at all for me.
I love that it resembles a Harvester from mass effect😈
At first I was like...wait, why are the Wardens here for a dragon? Is this an Archdemon? No? Just a dragon? Then what the hell? And then, oh the goddess can summon Darkspawn. Fun.
Another ghil scenes, and no elgar'nan
Hmmmm... MORE spoilers but no information on exactly how the button combos work, exactly how the different game modes work, how healing works since "healing schools are back in the game", how to toggle the UI changes and how accessibility options work/what they do when toggled on and off/what KIND of accessibility you're offering... THAT is the information we're all waiting for.... since, you know, this game is supposed to be so very inclusive and a LOT of us with disabilities can't easily deal with overwhelming flash and bloom, information overload, overly bright colours and flashing effects, action combat, managing button combos on keyboards, and seeing certain colour combinations like GREEN, RED, PURPLE AND YELLOW!!!    Anything?? For the accessibility and representation?? Anything?? NO?? 😒
I egged on the combat gameplay ever since they announced it but for a dragon fight it definitely looks and feels cooler than clicking to move and staying in one spot pressing 1234 on repeat.
what's with the bots lmao
This made me pre-order
Blood, Nudity, Sexual themes, strong language, violence. If you read these words at the beginning of the 21st century, then you knew it would be a great game. You read these words in 2024 and you realize that they lie as they breathe. Write at once: WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! woke is here, a great shame is comming. The truth is better. Yes, you will not receive money with a guarantee, but... Who's going to pay for a crappy product?😂
This woke bs and a poor excuse of a game deserves to fail.
Huge heads... huge heads... huge heads... can't unsee.
1:31 "Fire" is not the command when launching Balista. They should scream Release or Loose. Fire is used for firearms. It was always annoying to me that these companies cannot do proper research to avoid this rookie mistakes
OMG GHIL LOOKS SO COOL. I hope she's not "mad", though. She'd be a much more interesting villain if she's fully reasonable and in control of her actions, with very specific goals. Ideally, she should also be able to shift back into her elven form because she's the freaking goddess of flesh manipulation, what's the point of creating monsters if you can't look prettyy too? Also, I'm really glad that there are more blighted dragons than just the archdemons
Did they really stick ballista RIGHT in front of the door? at least the dragon was nice enough to stand in the doorway  instead of fly around...
This looks siiiiick! The warping/teleporting reminds me a bit of Mass Effect.
Looks like mobile game, plays like mobile game and even forced cutscenes like mobile games. Living world? Full of forced cutscenes? Yeah no thats mobile game for sure.
The concord of rpg
Yaaaawn
TALK ABOUT WORLD STATES PLEASE That’s always been a massive selling point for me on this series and why I love it so much. Your reticence to say anything about the importing is making me very worried.
It looks great, what the hell is up with people......
Dragon age if it was made by 2018 twitter.
You know I had my reservations before (and especially hated the Official Reveal Trailer looking like it does) but I am sold. I love how mage (and overall everything) is no longer static when fighting, yey! ❤
THIS WAS SO SICK!!! I need it NOW! 😭😭
a lot of NPCs in the comments
Great!!
Sooo the Dragons are Not Archdemons ? Good i dont want to see how my Warden Rook dies XD
There are so many bots here. Aren't you sick of it yourself?) The game looks bad, the combat is too cartoonish and boring, the huge heads are not attractive to the characters. There is no place for woke in games!
Top demais esse game vai levar o game do ano
So, our enemy is Walmart Lilith?
Very Dark. Animations looks superb.  Combat really suprised me how good and fluid it looks. maybe a GOTY contender. Let’s see
ok it's better than expected chara design still atrocious
How can anybody listen to this dialogue and not cringe?  Also, lol @ all the bots spreading toxic positivity in the comments XD
But why the pronoun shit?
Nothing beats second dragon.
I can't wait to play as a Grey Warden again and finally going to battle with all my brothers and sisters! GW lore is some of the most interesting to me and I can't wait to see the consequences if the Blight actually ends 👀
This makes me want to relive my Warden days with all these blighted creatures
gameplay and characters are a joke  UI looks like mobile game even dragon age inquisition which was worst game in the serie had better early gameplay trailer then this thing this game will need a lot of mods to remove and add stuff btw why I can see only positive comments about this game here?
Soo Excited!!!! Time is so slow waiting for this game!!!!!
This trailer was quite good and I am glad that it confirmed that Spellblade can have different elemental builds. Please consider also adding more Fire abilities for Mage - from what was shown currently Fire builds lack variety (have less options than Cold and Lightning). Such addition could be for example iconic for Dragon Age Fire Storm or some form of fire explosion. Consider also making Arcane Shot's damage and affliction convert to element of weapon you have equipped when using it - that would make it compatible with more elemental builds and a more versatile single-target focused ability.
I've always loved my Mages. But this is otherworldly right here. I. Cannot. Wait. First character gon be a Mage. Let's get iiiitt!!!
Meh
Combat looks sloppy. What's with the Dragon pausing flight mid-air lol
Поскорее бы игра уже вышла:В  Мой человек-маг уже жаждет приключений!
I didn't think the blight could get any worse than the dark spawn, seeing how it's evolving is so cool
looks more and more a mobile game, the more I look at it
Love the dynamic combat and enemy design!! I can"t wait to play as soon as it's available <3
Force "her" to land? Did they just assume that dragons gender? No wonder its pissed.
I have an actual question. I’m a bit blurry about DA lore at moment, expecially origins. But a “blighted dragon” shouldn’t basically be a new archdemon?  The archdemons are basically dragons infected by the darkspawn which than arise and take control over the whole army,kickstarting a new blight. So a blight is currently happening in Veilguard? So early because of external forces? Or simply “not all infected dragons are old dragon gods worthy to become archdemons”?
Only five weeks left!
Looks like a mobile game.
Concord number 2
Lmao looks like a gacha game gameplay
🥰👍👍👍👍
Screaming, crying, throwing up. JUST LEMME HAVE IT ALREADY
is this android game?
why does the sound have to be so horrible >.> the dragon barely makes any loud noise its actually offputting
Shameless bot posting wtf EA that's actually pathetic
Can’t wait to be the hero
Boy,say what you will about Bioware,but they still know how to make cutscenes! Also,the helmets at 1:10 and 1:12 are dope!
this is looking fine!!
I know this issue has been beaten to death, but it really is hard for me to take this game seriously with the art style. Summoning and fighting a blighted dragon should be a scary and menacing feat, this looks very sterile and cartoony, like something you might see in a pg movie fight scene.
Cant wait to slay blight dragons again and be the hero of Ferelden again i mean Tervinter
Saw the fight at the State of Play yesterday (didnt finish watching that fight) and didnt know that this was Dragon Age.   Oof.
Soulless slop.
Don't buy it, don't pirate it, don't play it. Your wallet is your only voice.
This looks bad
This realy looks bad
This game looks more like Fable than new Fable does.   Smooth. Bloom-ridden. Sanitised. Dumbed down combat. Big heads. The message. A sad mimicry.
It looks so goddamn generic :')
*wow!* Just *wow!* 👍💯
This looks sooooooo good cant wait to play it !!!!
So what exactly are these dragons? Just random dragons or archdemons?
Soulless woke trash.
Ghilan'ain looks fucking AWESOME... Though she is also the only thing in this game so far that feels like Dragon Age.
Definitely doing a mage and rogue, can't wait!
This scene remind me Game of Thrones
Finally got some adults in this comment section!
trash
Im loving the new fortnite season!!!
there is no way this has only 9% dislikes, on ps trailer there are 40%, this is ugly af
When will be sexy witches but not this freak show?
This looks like an ad for League of Angels, lmao.
Give it to me right now!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
looks like something I would defo play
gameplay warrior please !
Looks very bland. Thedas had so much potential, its a shame they've decided to turn it into a completely generic fantasy setting.
amazing
So who are the love interest? Also, do we get to see Dorian? I really want to see Dorian again.
This looks more like a Kingdoms of amalur sequel more than a dragon age game
I slew the Archdemon Urthemiel during the last Blight, "protected" Morrigan from Flemith in her High Dragon form, dispelled the Queen of the Black Marsh, wrestled Corypheus' Red Lyrium Dragon, reigned fire down upon Hakkon Wintersbreath, and went dragon hunting all across Southern Thedas.  What's one more flying reptile to me?  *Second dragon joins the fray*  Well.. shit..
wasn't convinced on first trailer, but now i am kinda hyped :)
SHEESH!
Is it too late now just to adjust people head size 😅 they kindda look like bubble heads! apart from that, looks great! Can’t wait to play as a Spellblade mage!
These comments have got to be bots. "They let her cook AND serve." Get out of here, no one sounds that lame.
This looks incredible! Is it going to be on iOS as well or just android?
Hmm blighted dragons...not archdemons...hmm🤔✨️ interesting interesting  And this dragon's name is Corius Not Razikale or Lusacan 🤔  Im so excited! 🥹
It's like a f*cking movie !! And yet after that some people would still say that it's "goofy" Personally i'm more and more hyped
It looks insanely boring
What's blighted is the game.
summon my warden from da:o and ur problems are solved 😉
looking awesome 👍
So many haters 😑
I love it! Playing a mage looks so much more fun!
I seriously cannot wait for this! Looks so good, definitely going to play a mage.
Look so bad
It looks boring, ugly, poorly written, nonsensical (what the fuck are even those ballistas?) and just plain bad…
Better if this game was called Kingdoms of Amalur 2
Will there be dragon flying mechanics? Like in Anthem.
Bot comments everywhere, LMFAO.
Best trailer yet
Comment section must be monitored.  Combat looks boring and the writing seems pretty bad.
I was already excited, but this is next level excitement 😍😍
Wow, no wonder why Solas isolated these creepy a$$ Gods
Thank you for this. I had my doubts before, but after seeing this, I'm now 100% sure I'm not buying this game.
Much darker than I thought. I love it!
Trans age : The Gaygaurd.
First game came out in 2009. People who played it surely remember legendary battle of Ostagar. 15 years later and you deliver inferior cutscenes and gameplay. Shame on you. Shame on you. Obviously all that talented people that worked on first game are all long time gone and this is the "talent" that replaced them.
The dragon battles were the best part of Inquisition from my memory so expecting them to build on that.
I hope she has other flying creatures besides those dragons
what a boring poop fighting Scenery... look s like a game straight outa 2012....
YAAAAY this was incredible!!!!!! Can't wait any longer
People can keep talking shit about this game before it even come out, but I want to give it a chance.
woke shit
Can the Qunari look more shit? xD
first trailer that they released that looks semi decent.. until the goofy looking cartoon dragon came out .. not sure why they thought a lego fortnite looking dragon would be a good fit but this trailer even with the uncessary spoilers are better than anything else theyve released since inquisition -edit- red dragon looks slightly less goofy than blue dragon from that angle, still looks goofy , and the corrupted joke of ghilan'nain looks like a clown of a mob spawn enemy .. you can tell the devs really dont care about dragon age and just wanted the agenda pushed.. the only thing 'dragon age' about this trailer was the name 'grey warden'  hopefully next dragon age game will actually relate to dragon age
Вроде норм
When I saw Rook shield herself from the Dragons fire breath, That's when I knew my first playthrough will be a mage!! 😱😱
I'm so torn between Metaphor and this, man... 2 huge RPG, very different and both amazing..🙈
This looks amazing!!!
Boehm Ferry
Gimme blade of tidarion knight enchanter build and no battle will ever be lost :D
Electronic arts and BioWare are practically showing off so much of the game reaching spoiler territory. I find this a curious strategy in marketing.
This looked ridiculously good, but it's definitely not helping me in choosing my class. Or faction  * cries in overexcited fan *
The battle looks so epic! I can't wait to try out all the combos!
Ok, I'm in.
yeah definitely Fortnite graphics and not dark at all. All the dragon age haters were so right (end of irony)
This looks amazing--the people seem realistic, the animations look well-synced and well-modeled, and the combat looks fun!
I swear, if you muted the voices with no subtitles and showed this to someone without telling them the name of the game they would never be able to guess this was a "Dragon Age" game... Seriously who is responsible for the art and character designs? The people who are supposed to be Grey Wardens look nothing like them. I assume those ghoulish creatures are supposed to be Darkspawn & even the Dragon/Archdemon looks nothing like one from any of the previous games. Also, doesn't help all the female characters look like the product of a few generations of incest ffs.   How are there people hyped up for this incoming train wreck? The only thing Dragon Age about this game is surface level references and the name. This is to Dragon Age, what Amazon's awful Rings of Power is to Lord of the Ring... Yea, I have no intention of wasting my time and money on this Saturday morning cartoon wearing the skin suit of Dragon Age.
Woke trash
Just wow
It is no fair that this game is not available in egypt . I want to play it😢
Why did it start looking so cartoonish?
Honestly stop spoiling soo much. Basically just spoilt the whole of act one. This is irritating. At this point you just may as well release the game early. Now we know what one of the eleven good look like and sound like. Irritated
As a long time dragon age fan, at least from a gameplay standpoint this looks to be the best yet. Really pumped to get my hands on this game. The art style is also growing on me funny enough.
Only  6000 likes? Don't be so stingy with buying fake likes, EA!
Throughout the series I'm hunted by one question... Is Dragon Age or Dragon Hunt Age? 😂
They’re using AI?
I'm still waiting for release to buy the game, but so excited 🙏🙏🙏
Grey Wardens: Totally useless from the times of Inquisigion when one gets destroyed by random mob which our grest hero handles single-handedly
This is good idea? too much spoilers
Guilleman? Are we about to see space marines stomp on Solas?😱🤣
The end of Bioware is coming
That grey warden looks like an old Alaistor
Keep your woke trash
This looks great! Although I wish that they would look less.
So many bots here. Fuk this woke gatbage
Concord has been alone lately, at least now it will have this game as company 😂
Concord Age : The disney
YESSSSSS THIS IS FU**ING DRAGON AGE BABYYYY!!! 🎉🙌👏🤘🤘🤘🤘
I'm in it more for the story, setting, world, & characters, but this gameplay is the best one yet. This dragon fight is intense & epic. I'm really liking the new combat style that's accompanying the rest of the game & story.
where's the architect
Damn, that was actually pretty dark. I love it!
Bioware needs to fire their marketing team, because after that initial trailer, I literally can't take any of these new trailers seriously, they're so aggressively different in tone they reek of desperation, it's hilarious And no matter how grim and gritty it looks, the moment they cut back to the main characters and their Disney channel cartoon faces, it just ruined the tone, they look like they belong in different game
Why they're all looks like transwoman???
I like this more serious style of the trailer a lot more… But the art style just makes it into a joke… Those dark spawn…
“Guess who’s back, back again. Grey Wardens are back, to save us again.”
Can't wait to play this game!!
This looks objectively terrible.
TJIS IS PS5 GAMEPLAY !!!!! OMG I LOVE THIS
The dragon boss fight looks pretty good, but not as satisfying as I'd hoped. This might be the nostalgia talking, but I remember the dragon fights in Inquisition having more oomph. Or at least they felt that way. Those fights were my favorite part of Inquisition, feeling mechanically distinct from all the prior boss fights in the series.  Then again, it looks like this fight was just a preliminary fight with the dragon boss in question, so it might be that the real-deal fight has a more going on. It felt like the dragon wasn't meaningfully pressuring the Rook on this one, apart from a couple of infrequent lunges and fireballs.
Phew so the dragon is not actually archdemon it seems. Given used name for it. I was worried we actually will have both Razikale and Lusacan up and about.
Those companions seem really useful. Half of the time, they stand around, doing nothing, and the other half, they are running. Perfect. No pressure, Rook!
Omg 😱  I got chills N finally a clear look of tentacle mommy
oohh.. it's fire and ice.. yay..
Christ Bioware, the content creators you invited are doing a better job marketing this game than you are. The trailer is boring and, for the love of god, stop showing the same location. We get it, the game has dark-ish areas, show something else ffs.
The qunari’s model is such a disgraceful downgrade from Dragon Age 2😞😞😞
They’re deleting the negative comments lol
Ugly women and weak men, PS3 level graphics... animations... Have you ever seen the boss animations of Black Myth Wukong? Why couldn't they do the same? Lack of experience or money?
this is looking promising
This looks so fucking bad.
GOTY!
What have you done to our beloved series of dark fantasy games? Why do the characters look so flashy and comical? Why are you trying to add things to the game that have never been in the series? What’s wrong with the characters' faces? Why can the editor only make the character fat? Developers, do you even step outside of Twitter into the real world? Why does the game look like a cheap port from a smartphone? I hope people won’t waste their money on what you’re calling a game. This is a total failure.
Women in D&D have busted the whole genre.
I hope Mass Effect doesn't decide to go with this same simplistic approach to the art style.
This dragon is not at all scary. Compare the dragon from origins to this, even skyrim dragons are far better. These dragons remind me  of how to tame your dragon anime. Why the age restriction ? Even kids will find it mild compared to other cartoons.
zzz
Assmould cultists unite
I was wondering when we would see a Dragon fight :) This looks like a lot of fun!
2:15  that's... whewww 😮‍💨😮‍💨🥵🥵🥵 LET'S GO MAGES 🎉🎉🎉🎉
That trailer was awesome!!!!!!! DragoWeen is coming!
I had to use PTO so I can play this game when it comes out. Looks like it’ll be worth the wait :) so excited!!
The combat looks and feels floaty along with the horrible UI for commands. Just wow. This shouldn't have been called Dragon Age.
Looks dope as hell
Dragon Age, now with double blighted action
Been liking this game so far but I’m really thrown off by the empty battlefield arena of this boss fight
BIOWAREEEE release the character creation early to premake characters, and my life is yours
Looks like absolute fucking garbage.
Lazy animations and even worse character models. The real BioWare stuff have left a long time ago. But I suspect this is not even the A-team of their sad replacements. This reeks of Andromeda-level of incompetence.
Woke shit. Sad. I LOVE DAO and DA2
Oh my goddd ,😱Looks amazing and incredible🫠
This looks sick af can't wait to play it
This actually looks really good! I haven't really liked any of the other videos shown for the game but this one looks great.
It's going to be the happiest Halloween of my life! Trick or treat? ATASHI!
The dragon's faces look.... not good. The art direction and scenery just didn't feel like it gave any weight to the events. I'll wait for a discount, I guess...
🤮
That is, the developers cut the availability of using a variety of skills during combat to 3 available skills, made this set of skills unavailable quickly during a dynamic battle in which make a BIG EMPHASIS. But at the same time, during the battle, constantly open the window with forces (which is also a tactical pause) to use the abilities of party members, doing this constantly, again, you can’t switch and play for your party members. What kind of genius came up with this with a minimum of akyu and an excessive surplus of chromosomes. To focus on the action while castrating it, to cut down on the abilities, but at the same time it is necessary to combine with the abilities party members. What a.... Well, at least here everything is bright, glitters, farts, sparkles, whistles, explodes, flash, bang, alakazam and all this in acidic colors and sleek glamorous characters. If you castrate the combat system, it doesn't make an RPG deep.
What a Great Flop.
I have yet to find any information confirming or denying this question of mine: will the game be available in a physical PC copy? I have my little shelf of DA games with physical PC copies and was hoping to continue the tradition…
IS THAT KING ALISTAIR????
Oh Maker, this already seems exciting by the look of it! Wonder when it's gonna be released in Europe. Hoping that it gets a Switch Release. So looking forward to playing this game.
Casting Singularity on 3 min mark, that's some sloppy copy and paste from MassEffect.
Ghilan'nain, looks more like a Darkspawn than an elf. Was she dug up and corrupted by the Darkspawn, similar to what happened with the Old Gods?
Every pretended as wamen in this game flat as your lifeline, Hope EA closed your studio after this.
Game looks so dumb... all of the dragon age aesthetic and gameplay is gone...
That's probably one of the best Dragon Age: The Veilguard trailers, gray wardens finally look epic 🔥
Hogwarts legacy ahh looking game.
go woke go broke
I was like oh shit the blighted ice dragon looks cool AF, then I was like oh shit theres a aecond dragon, and then Ghil makes an appearance and suddenly its just one big shit show id be shitting my pants if i was rook trying to figure out how in the hell im supposed to take on 2 blighted dragons, a small army of darkspawn, and the one who created them an Elvhen goddess who looks all creepy like with the tentacles
This is awesome
Are they actually gonna call her Gilla-nayn in the game? I thought that was just a mistake when I heard devs saying it.
Stop being excited for this wokeshit. Acolyte and Concord cancelled, Outlaws flopped. All we need to do is make Wokeguard flop and elect Trump in November and 2024 will go down in history as the bane of wokeism
Lol they turned off the UI cause it normally looks like a clutter mess.
I am eagerly awaiting the show we're going to get when this game "fails to reach expectations".
Bioware is dead
With only three spells mages can not do anything just swinging rod like that I think giving it proper spell book through some means of dlc or patch is needed
Haha, the small rocks everywhere on the battle field reminds me so much of Inquisition. I cant wait to get my grubby hands on this game
Gotta give it to the Wardens, they didn’t back down 🔥
looks terrible. so now that we're at the 10 year mark of DA:I and biowares decline, hows that "driving out the talented employees and hiring bums off the street to fill their positions" plan working out for you guys?
いいじゃないか！いいじゃないか！ いつも、重戦士ドワーフでやってるけど魔法使いもかっこいいなぁ！ そしてグレイォーデンは闇の中で泥臭く戦うのが似合ってる。 誰にも知られず、時には名誉すらなく、しかして大義に死すのがウォーデンよね。
Despite the Woke Bullshit... i like the gameplay.
只要別在搞政確 這款我一定會買 感覺很好玩
the queen of the darkspawn, one good thing I glad they made these Gods hard to kill and it won't be that easily and the grey warden help you to beat one of them, I hope choose matter cause image if you refuse to help the grey warden, in this battle the grey warden are not there and it bunch of darkspawn everywhere cause you didn't help the grey warden, like choose like that and other
"Your battle is already lost" Sir, I think shes right kkkkkkk
Not gonna lie, the cinematic direction is top notch !
GHIL BELOVED
Bro they really need some people who know how to play game because this is by far the best showcase of this game.
Looks nothing like Dragon Age. More like Medieval Fantasy Disco Time. Who tf greenlights these games?
It looks like a mobile game.
this remind me of Jaws Of Hakkon's icey-dragon
Dragon Age lovers unite. We’ve been waiting for this one
This looks so bad. BIOWARE you need to clean house! Something is wrong and you are not your former self idk if it is EA that is to blame or what but wow. This looks so rough
I'm sold
37 days before I can give the Evanuris these godly hands!👊🏿 Give "Fade" a whole new meaning.
1rst time i see an ugly dragon in a videogame... Wtf with the boss design's..?
Roflmao the comments, looks like average mobile game, plays like average mobile game but one thing differentiates it from average mobile game, atrocious companions. Maybe next time.  Btw Qunari looks terrible.
Since when has "Ghilan'nain" been pronounced like that?
YES! Finally a mage's shield that's active and not suck, and short cooldown blink. And looks like so many choices in skills too. And I just freaking realized that Ghilan'nain seems to have 2 torsos 0.0 one of top of the other and so her 2 sets of arms have different shoulders.
Gameplay looks Good but i Dont like the Aestetics of the Dragon compared to Dragon Age Inquistion. The Dragon in veilguatd looks kinda Tame and less scary while the Dragon from inquistion looked Initimitating
Oh maker, the battle system looks insane!! I'll definitely be a mage this time 💜
MAGA 2024!!!
Is this Erika Ishii's voice? I've been dying to her the fem US voice.
Idk why everyone wants the darkspawn and qunari to look like DA2 when that was the shittiest Dragon age game and was EXCEEDINGLY under budget. Not to mention all the qunari looked the same. If anything they should put more detail on the qunari.  This looks amazing I hope everyone stops bitching cause IGN doesn’t know how to work game mechanics.
_Me, a long-time "Dragon Age" fan since "Origins" after watching this gameplay trailer_  "I don't need it... I don't need it... I don't need it..."
Played a mage in origins, awakening, DA2 and Inquisition. Time to play one in Veil guard now XD
I thought of being a Shadow Dragon, but this trailer changed my mind. I'm going to be a Warden Mage instead, just like my Amells in previous games.
Don't judge a book by its cover 😂
Looks so good. I think you outdid yourselves with this one!
Looks so cringe.....hope this flop is what finally does "Bioware" or what's left of it in, and I hope it serves as an example for game companies to stop hiring activists
I see that they have turned off most of the UI. Makes the game look cleaner, at least. But I don't think it will be feasible to play like this.
Freaking amazing ❤❤❤
As someone who is part of the “woke” community I’m so here for this!😊
BOOOOOORING
I can't wait!!!! 10 years too long!! 💜💜
Hell yea! I broke my no pre-order rule and am ready! Let's goooo!
I have so much hope for this game i literally am counting down the days
I think im going to do Warrior Steve Rogers first playthrough. Haha
My only gripe is how Bioware has slowly stripped the Qunari of their cool design from DA:2, they've gotten more and more human, Taash is essentially looks like a tall elf with horns. I like having actual diversity of races beyond the same ol' Human, Elf, Dwarf trifecta.
All the new deep dives, and hands on. I’m definitely very excited for this Dragon Age!
Im so bloody excited!! Plus the fact i can play it on my Steamdeck!!
To think...ghilan'nain used to be an elf...how far she has fallen
This is the most shallow, pathetic, woke, plastic, superficial garbage I've ever seen in a trailer.  It's horrific to imagine how this abomination of a game is going to be.  And they post this trash as if they're proud of it.  How the 'mighty' (Bioware Andromeda) has fallen.  Pathetic.  this from a hardcore Dragon Age fan
10 long years. Dragon Age is finally back
All the hater’s can go kick rocks!!! This looks soooo good 😊 I can’t wait !
whit every dragon age lauched they are getting worse, lol origins was amazing the 2 was kinda me but the characters feel so much more organic to me,  inquisition was worse than dragon age 2 :s i didnt realy like the story nor the characters lol, it returns to the old structure of Origins story wise except it does it worse, it reduced the enjoyment of combat, and well this veliguard the story looks bad LOL no coments on characters probly worse ones so far, combat seems ok but its only  a video i may skip it lol
I like that none of the female soldiers appear to have "breast" plates. Looks good! Hopefully I'll actually be able to finish this one.
Your battle is already lost, BioWare. And you have the top scars to prove it.
Ok i pre order this
The mage combat looks so fun! I'm really starting to become impatient over here.
Wow! Awesome
Finally more Taash
go woke go broke with this ps4  graphics game
Man, do i feel vindicated after this. I've long suspected a connection between the darkspawn and elven gods for years since trespasser and i think this confirms it. I'm like Wash in Serenity seeing this trailer, "reavers...they made them...!"
At long last we hear Ghilan'nains voice. Now I wonder what Elgar'nan's voice sounds like.
This looks like shit
I don't think this will run a razerblade 17 pro rtx 3080 with a i7 processor.
BRING BACK BAD ASS LOOKING CHARACTERS!! All of these look like LGBTQ people! Not bad as at all!
I like everything but the mage basic attacks.  I don't like the tracer beams vibes. I miss my over the top staff animations 😢. Might be the first game I dont play a mage in since 2. But the teleporting MIGHT make up for it 😅
seems nice! best trailer so far the hairs in this game are pretty
If you would’ve showed this first…dang. The reception would’ve been so much more hyped. Looks amazing.
OMG 😳 I have goosebumps all over my body 🥹 it’s so so cool!!! 😍
I'm so hyped for this 💚🐺
I NEED THIS GAME NOWWW
That voice direction for Ghil, sublime.
This is not the same Bioware
I kind of wish Taash were the protagonist. She looks so badass! 😄
Looks like UI was removed for this trailer. Hope I can have some sort of in-between when I'm playing, so the screen doesn't get too busy and important information is clear :)
Finally some good Taash content! Looks like I'm playing a mage...again
Bring on nightmare difficulty 🥵
Come Under Dunkin died for this 😔😔😔
I'm so hyped!! Sound design goes crazy.
omv omg omg looks like fartnite looks like raid shadow legends looks like clash of clans looks like Boom Beach😮😮😮
Guys the game looks brilliant but why is it not available for preorder for console in india ? the wait is tormenting.
Time to call the dragonborn
This comment section feels so astroturfed. I cant help but feel the fake positivity. Theres no way they all good when the game looks this shit. The voice actors dont even sound interested in their roles, and the gameplay is so boring they had to cut the footage.
If the gods will be like Corypheus in DAI, all HAR HAR IM EVUL and getting their ass kicked all the time - no thanks. I want good dialogue and villains, not a cartoon.
AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH god i'm so excited
A cada trailer aumenta as chances de um GOTY
nah looks like shit
You know... For the Mother of the Halla... Those don't look like peaceful, magestic, frolicking white deer.
I hope this pozzed garbage tanks.
Unhand this game 😢 immediately 🤲🏿
Great footage, still excited but man I can't unsee the big heads now.
October 31st can't come soon enough I'm so excited to finally play new Dragon Age content <3
Honestly, I'm digging this Dragon Age combat, I thought to myself they have strayed too much away from what made DAO AND DAI amazing, but honestly, this got me more excited, hopefully this is not an unoptimized mess of a game.
Should have cooked a bit more with those blighted dragon designs.
Man this feels epic. Although this really cements my feeling that the grey wardens are DA’s warhammar space marines. Clearly a studio favorite faction of badass super warriors….but fighting threats so powerful that they are ALWAYS getting massacred on screen unless they are a main character with no helmet
I CANNOT WAIT OMG IT LOOKS SO GOOD❤❤❤❤
During the fight it’s cool seeing how minimal the UI could be. I’m fine either way but I know for some having the option to reduce some of the UI elements is great!
💜 🐉
Nice voice acting. I love the visual appearance.
Ok this was cool
The woke ppl started their comments early....
Damn it’s amazing how they are turning skepticism to excitement in the last few weeks
I just hope we get to see flash backs of Mythal’s murder and interactions with all the other gods before they died.
ah fuck it take my money bioware
hooollllyyyyyy craaaaappppp. YYYEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS I AM SOLD!!!!
Ok, so from a tactical point of view, if you know a dragon's lair is in a old tower, why would you set up balista 10 feet from the entrance? I feel like in most of the Grey Warden clips I've seen, their tactic is to either line up or group up and wait to get murdered.
Looks awesome!! The wardens look so coool ahhhh
👍
Disgusting woke trash! Hope it tanks!
oh yeah getting ready for it can't wait to enjoy this game
MAN the graphics. I'm gonna be so shook all day on Nov 1!
блять, какие же персонажи уроды. голова слишком огромна по сравнению с телом и бегают/ходят они так, словно хорошенько наложили в штаны. а боевка выглядит просто уныло
I am so hype! this actually did the game some justice! More and more excited by the day
戦闘かっこよ！
I must say, dragon age team is bold af, showing a lot of the game, letting tons of people play it for hours. BioWare is very confident and Corinne seems (to me) very passionate and proud about Veilguard. I don’t pre order any game. But as soon as this game releases if it’s good as it is showing, it’s a must buy for me.
OMG the other day i said i'll play as a sword and shield warrior this time around because in DA2 and in DA Inquisition i played as a mage but after seeing this and the mage deep dive i don't know now.
I'm sorry but I just really fucking hate that look all the characters have. That horrible softened appearance. Each and every one. Like they've got a permanent Snapchat filter on. Honestly. It bothers me so goddamn much. Like everything looks fine to me, I don't really care about the gameplay changes, and I desperately want a new Dragon Age, but then I see them and I just cannot stomach it.
Damn they buffed the Grey Wardens appearance with new Armour
Let's go! I want this game to be great so badly! If the game is like the recent trailers and hype, it could be game of the year.
Waited 10 long years. Can't wait to play as a grey warden once again!
Ghilan'nain's design reminds me a **LOT** of Corypheus and the Architect, which makes me wonder: where the seven magisters that besieged the Black City really the Evanuris?
Awesome!
honestly i was pretty sure i was goin for either warrior or rogue but damn does this gameplay make me want to play mage
Were those Grey Wardens I just saw? They're still around?
Video to selllllllll me! I'll be playing as Erika Ishii and as a mage
As a gender fluid otherkin, I demand to know why that dragon's gender was assumed. I will not stand idly by in the face of such injustice. Do better, Bioware.
This looks dope
I watched it and exclaimed: GOTY
Horrible, todos andróginos...parece un juego de móvil. Otra saga que va a morir. Estoy harto de cargar con los traumas psicológicos de otros. Fracaso. Y gracias por excluir a las mujeres en este fortnite age.
combat is good, really good.....BUT WHAT IN THA HELL IS THIS GRAPHICS ? the characters look horrible...the head is TOO big...the qnari horns are terrible...omg...
what is happening to our beloved IPs? Fable/ Dragon age/ Star wars (outlaws), they are being bastardized to maximize profits by getting the gen Z kiddos interested. pretty soon ill be lucky to have one major release per year that cares about mature adult gamers
This is torture.. I... need ... to .... PLAYYYYY
These character models... I just can't....
Is it me or was the dragon kinda of, slower than the dragons in the previous installment? I remember in DAI they mention they used feline movements when hunting to mimic for their dragons, did they change the formula? Idk just seem kind of rigid for me
Dragon age the Failguard
God this game looks so peak. Halloween can’t come soon enough
go woke go broke
....... DOn't tell me these smiling boys are Darkspawn, how could you make them..... just less... intimidating 😂😂
honestly I wasn't really excited or impressed with all the trailers and promotion... UNTIL NOW! I'm loving what I'm seeing so far.
This looks terrible...  Do they not understand Dragon Age?   These Devs are cooked.   What a sad state.   Not a chance i can be positive about this.   What a joke!
Great video, great pictures! Is there a photo mode in Dragon Age: The Veilguard? 😍
2:25 ok thats pretty cool, there is something so satisfying about your abilities being able to actually affect the physicality of a 20,000 pound dragon
This is gonna look great on my new pc.
Lol pure garbage
Ohhhh man this looks SO FREAKING GOOD AND I CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY!!!
Is that a singularity? When did they discover Biotics?
El diseño de los personajes eran mas aterradores en las versiones anteriores, hasta con un, no se que ...... pero bueno al menos hay una continuación
shit that's cool. Still going to wait for reviews, gameplays etc before buying it
Comments do not seems fake at all....
Reminded me of fighting the High Dragon in DA:2.
why does it look like a mobile game? yikes
Looks like a mobile game. Woke trash.
please fix the heads size, you’re still in time 🥺
Looking good ❤
I hope they fix the slightly off proportions (heads too big, shoulders too small) of many of the characters before launch. It's hard to unsee it once you've noticed it.
Honestly played all dragon age games and all expansions and add ons.. same with mass effect... and honestly.. I am loving it
God damn the warden armor looks fresh
I’m in. Jedi Fallen Order/Survivor, Dragon Age The Veilguard, EA please continue this trend of allowing your studios to make quality games. Let them cook.
Woooooooo
Why you fucking with Corius for?
Dude story  of this game i was like oh that's not so bad that's kinda cool Then BOOM game play  massive health bar cheesy looking ui i want to play this game But i dont wanna pay for this game ya feel me
The cutscenes are technically impressive, but the dragon fights in DAI were better.
Now I’m excited 🎉
They discussing the strategy about how to kill the dragon is so cool, that balista turn was so cool too
Pre-ordered, payed off, and request approved for nov 1st off im set. Just need to be patient.............is it out yet? 😂
Man I can’t wait for this game. GOTY showing up late to the party this year
GOTY. I am BEGGING on my hands and knees for early character creator!
Man this Was everything i needed to see:  Grey wardens! Dragon Boss fight! And cool Mage Combat!
Other games human warrior but in dragon age its always elf mage. That combat looking really good.
I’m stoked for this! Idc what all the haters are saying! Dragon age helped me through hard times when I was going through it and can’t wait to enjoy it once more!
This was awesome! What a perfect bday gift 😊
Why do I feel this game is going to be amazing? The release timing could lead to BioWare-level success! You’ve cleverly engaged both hardcore fans and casual players, making the gameplay more accessible and already looking phenomenal.
Sweet baby the game
🔥 🔥 🔥
🗑️
Looks great. You guys have cooked up something pretty awesome.
Release the Character Creation 😭 I cant wait any longer
It’s worth pointing out that a LOT of these types of trailers are centered around the conflict with Ghilan’nain… friendly reminder that Elgar’nan is the equivalent of Zeus in DA elven lore… they’re keeping his highlights veeeeeery hidden… that’s gonna be the scary one if they do it right. Love the Ghil vibes, almost Lovecraftian mad scientist is a great twist. But if Elgar’nan is awesome, take my money.
Looks like a couple of the members in the dev team play Monster Hunter. I mean this in every good way possible.
Holy shit! This has me in tears because I am so excited. Good job BioWare!!!
Fighting dragons and now you only have 2 companions... great. 🤦‍♂️
I'm sorry but anyone hating on this game is an actual idiot, this looks sick!
What do you think of the worst design the Qunari chick , the dragon or, the dark spawn.
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!!! IT'S ALREADY BEEN A LONG WAIT PLEASE!!!
I was so worried but this looks to be even better than inquisition 🤞
OH MY GOSH THIS LOOKS SO COOL! 😍
Ya know... That was actually a good trailer and what people who miss "old bioware" have been asking for or hoping to see I think. And mage actually looks fun, all gameplay for mage has been trash imo but this looked interesting. Whoever took lead with this marketing should keep going.
Keep your self-mutilation, and disgusting pandering. Many of us will boycott this crap.  BioWare is truly cooked. RIP.
Omg that gave me goosebumps, that was amazing I’m so excited
I think it's easier to showcase the combat when there's lots going on, with plenty of enemies to fight. But this battle... it was like I could see the seams coming apart, very little going on. I could physically feel it dragging on too long, I was almost thankful for the cuts. 😬
Been waiting for this. Not bad!
BioWare, I love you.
without the ugly UI, the game actually looks half decent. Hope we can turn it off.
This game looks good I just wish they didn't go woke.
Surgery Age
Me, slowly rocking in place, chanting, "Just a few more weeks, just a few more weeks, you can do this....."
This should have been the trailer 💜 game can’t come soon enough!!!
WHY DOES THE METEOR SPELL LOOKS SO LAME AF? THE ATTACK SPELLS LOOK STRAIGHT OUT OF A MOBILE GAME. WTF HAPPENED TO DRAGON AGE?!?!?!
That looks insane! Let's goo!!!
Parabéns BioWare!!!vocês sempre conseguem  superar as espectativas. Esse novo dragon age vai ser jogo do ano!!
Looks awesome! Still blown away by how good Rook looks in these cutscenes. Can't wait to see my character there.
My Gooooodd...FINE I'll preorder it already!!! Take my Money and get me to 10/31 quicker! This was amazing!!
New Dragón Age Petanko
It looks so much far from Origins but I'm still gonna play it so I can punch the Egg again
I will never understand the haters of this game...
From what I've gathered watching this and "in entropy's grasp" mission the sound design seems to be quite promising.
Any info about how it runs on the base ps5? Like 1440p 60 fps? 1080p 60 fps? How much of a graphical downgrade is it from the pc? It's weird that we didn't get any information on that yet...
Ahhh, Ghilan'nain squicks me out so much. She needs to die first!
Bioware died ages ago, ever since this beaming ray of light came to see you, Anita Sarkeesian, it's been down hill. You all lost your B411$. Hard Pass.
This is the first trailer I've seen which has actually given me some hope that this game has something. I've not really been impressed before today, but the UI being decluttered and the combat looking far more interesting is very welcomed indeed. Voice acting seems really stellar too.
Not with these cartoonized, infantilized character models, nope.
Looks pretty neat, wish the developers best of luck with remaining development and upcoming release :]
Hope you guys keep feeding us till release. It's gonna be a slow month 😅
I’m so ready for this game to come out! Already pre order it, this will be my Halloween!!
Hell Yes!! Cannot wait for Halloween ❤
お、おう。すげーよ。マジで。 ただ女性キャラは1人くらいは登場させても良かったかもね。今は平等が求められる時代だし。
Good shit! Admittedly, I was quite sceptical at first but the more I've seen, the more I'm looking forward to getting my hands on the game!
Looking better than I thought but still have my worries. I'll wait and see on this one. Darkspawn still looking hella goofy
I still don't like of the character design used in Dragon Age: The Veilguard but the game looks promising.
DEI the game
This is my game of the year without a doubt.
Can't stop seeing how big everyones head looks now, also these comments seems filtered af.
For a modern audience.
UI looks cleaner, thank the Maker. Everything seems to improve as we see more of the game.
By the maker that was sick 🫣
I'm so gonna die.
I'm playing mage hands down 😅
whoa, much better than that first trailer - now i'm officially exited <3
Amazing ♥
I love Dragon Age and I'm loving this new game!  I can't wait to play ❤🎮
SOOOO READY!!!!!!
holy shit im so hyped
I’m going to miss tactical view and issuing commands.
Got my pre-order already, can't wait.
Unbelievable 😳💯👌
Too bad the game come sooner. It would cool to fight another dragon. Like the Archdemon, the high dragon in the bone pit and Corypheus's dragon. What's two more?
The third guy got disrespected the most with that tentacle bitch slap😂
Eurogamer: "It's remarkable how far Dragon Age games have come in this regard. It doesn't even feel like an RPG anymore!"  Swen Vincke likes this.
Very nice❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
The kunari just look stupid
WARDENS WITH CAPES
Ok this looks really good
Capolavoro 😍❤️🔝
We're in business baby!! Let's goooooooo!!
This looks SOOOOO much better without all that combat UI
Gonna flop.
Vive Dragon âge! J'ai tellement hâte!
Damn, that was cool! Can’t wait to fight Ghilan’nain.
Only game I’m looking forward to now. Need something after playing through BG3 way too many times 😂
This had me so hyped. I really can't wait for the 31st! And I think whoever edited this trailer did a much better job of showcasing the mage gameplay than previous videos.
Ghilan'nain is so perfectly horrifying! And I'm delighted to see Taash more in recent trailers!
The animations look great.
GHILLY ARE YOU SINGLE??????
I know it says October 31 but hear me out…What if it came out today instead?
I have goosebumps ❤
I'M SO READY FOR THIS, I PREORDERED EVERYTHING LOL physical deluxe edition for ps5 Vyrantium pack Physical deluxe artbook COME ON DRAGON AGE🎉
Marketing clutch up
Bye bye strategy, let's just replace it with a Soulslike gameplay... Also, the graphics looks kinda plastic.
I think the Hero of Ferelden would like to have a word or two with Ghilan'nain
Me encanto el trailer, que ganas de jugarlo. Ya lo Preordene en Steam...
i love seeing all the positivity for this game for once. it truly puts into perspective that the crazy neckbeards are just a very vocal minority trying to ruin how hype this game actually is 🙌
Hey, some Taash footage at last
OMG OMG I need Halloween to get here faster! Am so excited!
People are way over-trashing this game, even with the art style being not preferred, this shit still looks epic! I'm afraid all the backlash over the character creator BS is going to completely kill the game though. It hardly bother me because it's all optional. Its not forcing the player to do anything. It's all player choice. The game looks fantastic.  This coming from a conservative from Edmonton, where the studio is.
Staaahhhppp!! No more spoilers! 😂😂
I love this new direction of dragon age. This looks so epic and the art style stands out from other rpgs like bg3, which was also amazing. Halloween hurry !!!
The people now bending over backwards cause the sentiment isnt going there way "bots, mentally underdeveloped" lmao COPE IS REAL for once, let it go lol, AC SHADOWS IS RIGHT THERE whine about that
Ghilan'nain  you crazy bastard
finally some good mage gameplay using their mechanics better.
Mass Effect Fantasy. So where is Dragon Age?
This looks amazing - I wish this had been the first trailer... we'd be in a totally different situation with casual fans and the general gaming community *sigh*
so cool!!!!!! i need it NOW!
OMG! This is so cool🤩 So far we can see Morrigan & Inquisitor will return. What about Hawke, Leliana, Hero of Fereldan? Little bit curious😇
I'm down!
Wasn’t paying attention to this game at all through its development after the last 2 BioWare games. Now, I’m hyped to play this.
When a random guy with a mullet giving orders is better looking than all the companions. They really hate the players. 😞
.... that was the freaking elvhan god???!!!! Yes! All the yes!!! Let's freaking go!
Yasss ❤ The worst part about this…the wait until October 31st. I cannot wait
Can't wait!
I ok this is good. 👀📝
Great, that feels kinda like Origins. I hope we see blood magic too. I'm trying to get excited about this game, I'm going to buy it on release anyway, I've waited ten years. 😢
When this game flops for the DEI, cartoonish, trans-promoting, play-it-safe-so-it-appeals-to-everyone, make-everything-in-the-UI-glow-because-gamers-are-idiots trash that it is, I'm gonna come back here and laugh, and laugh, and laugh. See you soon, Bioshit.
Thats what i wanted to see, something awesome but darker too. I wish i could make games like this damn. I was skeptical at first but im gonna be playing this like crazy. Its a different look but it's grown on me. Cant wait! I want to add something that just crossed my mind, if you take a look at the cinematic trailers for dragon age origins, 2 and inquisition, these graphics look very similar to the veilguards graphics. That was all i wanted playing dragon age growing up 😅
I CANNOT WAIT FOR LAUNCH. I am going to carry Lucanis in my pocket the entire game and let his little gremlin complain the whole time.
You've butchered the way Qunari look. I wont be playing dragon age anymore.
Ghil looks so good. 👀👀👀
i feel this game was what da2 was suposed to be
The heads are too big and the body’s too small.
oof.
How bad is it: staging and endless close-ups, effects, animations. Apparently, the qualifications are in question not only for interface designers. It's a shame, but each new trailer justifies low expectations, unfortunately.
Omg…Taash😍😍😍
Why not in 60fps, is it 30fps on console
😏I think we can all agree " SECOND DRAGON!!!!!!😅"
So hyped! 😄
This mage combat is exactly what I look for in action rpgs, unlike DD2's stand around for 15-20 secs to cast Meteoron and one shot everything. It seems like our companions have no hp and don't draw aggro, so they're just there to do dmg? Kinda defeats the purpose of a party system when the mc is the only one in danger.
seeing positive feedback here is so refreshing after the shithole that is twitter replies
I was worried when I saw the dragon at first. Looked weird and cartoon like. But the effects of the combat look super cool. At the same time the dragon battles don’t look much different from previous games. Wish you were able to climb the dragon. I got excited when I heard one of the characters say “aim for the wings, bring her down” but looks like the battle is all ground work.
36 more days... genuinely tweaking. Im so hyped.
looks good. I hope Bioware lands a hit here. I will play it but I'm far more excited for the next Mass Effect... a good Veilguard means EA will be happy and Bioware won't shut down and hopefully they'll provide the team working on the next Mass Effect enough time and money.
I think the game will be criticized negatively and rightly so! Bioware and EA need to fix this and see this before anything else or it will just be a game with a heavy and incredible name that will be a flop and a waste of time and money for the developers by focusing on the minority and ruining certain things. Let's go: The environments and characters. First the environment, it is very colorful and similar to High Fantasy, but the game has always had a more realistic and dark fantasy feel. The game should be darker, more gore and more adult in my opinion, whether in the interactions, the narrative, the personalities, the traits, the romance, everything. To have something similar to Mass Effect with Paragon and Renegade, Bioware got so many things right to get it wrong now, that's sad, they could just copy the good things and remove limitations, simple. Regarding the characters, there are obvious limitations in that no matter the character's gender, they will always look like a Frankenstein or a neutral/androgynous character. In other words, you can't make a totally male character, but rather a weird mix.  As for the female version, I don't even need to say, the real fans of the game are not represented, there are different types of women and different types of bodies and I'm sure there is exclusion in them. Anyway, there is no femininity, there is no delicacy in women, like, Cassandra is a great example that it is possible to be tough and be feminine, be delicate, etc. Anyway, there is no beauty and true freedom. Not even masculinity, since it is a very bad mix as I said before. Not to mention the huge heads of the characters, simply horrible. Besides that and this woke nonsense (Not that it is bad to represent people, but when you represent the minority and the majority is not represented, that is simply indisputable and shows that they are not concerned with the old fans, but with people who don't even like video games). Besides these things, the game must be very good, especially the story and narrative, but it is necessary for the game to not have enough sales or profit, because then they will understand that they are wrong and will either fix it or they will destroy an incredible franchise.  The fact is that if the game doesn't become a Skyrim in the sense of having several mods to fix these things, it will end up being a complete piece of crap even if the story is cool. It would be something similar to what happened with Mass Effect Andromeda, the difference is that after the fixes Andromeda became a good game although below expectations. @Dragon age You guys should worry about this before you start marketing, raising the price of the game and making trailers.
Did a monster hunter player grab the controller for this? This is sick
If I ask nice can I have the game now? 🥺🥺
I pre-ordered, trusting that Bioware will deliver a solid game that makes sure everyone can enjoy the game.   I just wish you would make it worthwhile to order the deluxe pre-order for even just a few days early download and play 😂
Alright, you got me. I'm hyped.
characters looks not good they look like fornite characters
Strong press A for Awesome vibes.
The trailer reassured me, it's much better.
The Dragonfight looks much more dynamic as it did in Inquisition
HOLY POO POO
OMG i need this game noooow
I’m getting toxic positivity vibes from this
Here we go babyyyyyyy!
Will we PLEASE get a video that features the American accent Rooks 😭 we’ve gotten so little, even from the content creators…
Watching gray wardens prepare for battle almost made me faint 🫨😍👏🏿
Omg Taash is so pretty here Jesus almighty. I swear the more I see of this game the more I can't wait to play it holy hell. I wanna know more about these characters and their stories.
The bots definitely seem excited. Too bad only humans can make purchases...
Instantly reminded of the Dragon fights in Inquisition, and those have always been some of my favorite fights in the game.
I love the DA fanbase lmao ,its one of the best
glad to see bioware finally learned how to do women hair looks amazing ingame
You guys have done such a great job so far! Excited to get my hands on the game!
I wish tomorrow is October 31! Can't wait
Is that Alistar on the Ballista? I'm super excited to play this game after my exam!
YESSSS Dragon fights were one of my favorite parts in Inquisition! 🙌😍
Oh I love all the cinematics in this game! The UI hidden during combat kind of improved the immersion. Will this be a feature?
The person playing is the guy with 0 dps during a raid. Kick this bot already what a terrible player
Can we please have this clean UI instead of the one shown before?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪
All this negativity - I am not sold on many many things on this game but I feel like the "hate" has some serious issues at the moment and is not just looking at what might be objective. I loved DA 1 - 2 was meh - Inquisition was hovering between good and ok but I liked it overall. This one feels - to me at least - like a polished inquisition with a strong focus on action combat(I dont really mind it). The artstyle is debatable, some decisions are definetly debatable but what I saw over the last weeks looks more promising than I had hoped - so actually I am kinda looking forward now - I wont preorder or buy it instantly but I see some hope that this game might be a lot better than I thought.
Bring back the old Grey Warden armor design!!!
Why does everything look so goofy in this game?  Art style is throwing me off.
too many women for me.
That Ai looks terrible, how can people think this looks good.
I wonder if that warden is Alistair....
OMG! Ghilan'nain looks soooo cool and creepy! I'm soooo excited.
FINALLY some taash crumbs
are these two dragons the last 2 Archdeamons?
I'm ready!!!!!!
Why does the Qunari warrior look half fantasy half trans.
the animation of the knights running at 3:49 looked like something out of a minion movie
This looks so good!!!! Also, since we can't use Keep for this game... Alistair better be in this game for my gameplay. I have kept him alive this entire time. But I feel like my hopes of having him meet his mother may be dwindling.
these are either all bots or people so mentally underdeveloped they could be considered bots
hell yeah
Damm everything looks so cute.
Holy... this Dragon fight looks so much more intense than what we got in DA2 or Inquisition!! Halloween can't come fast enough!!
This going be the last game of Bioware :(.
I think that solidifies it for me. I'm being a grey warden!
Trash, prepare to go under, Bioware. Your time has come.
That was a boring dragon fight. Doesn't look fun to play 😟
awful
Why are the heads so big  do the developers need to compansate anything ?
Ahhh this looks fantastic! So good to see Taash and the Wardens in action 💜
look so goofy and and the gameplay is hilariously bad and junky
Mobile game quality,if it costs 20 bucks,that would be fine.
I can't wait to finally play it!
GLORY TO MOTHER GHILANN'AIN 🙌🙌  SOON THE WORLD WILL SHARE THE PEACE AND COMFORT OF YOUR REIGN!!
Halloween can’t come soon enough!!! I’m so excited for this game!! Bring it on Ghilan’nain!!!
Sir, there's been a second dragon.
(sponsored comment) BIOWARE IS BACK!!!
That dialogue sure is something
1:18 that was a very unsheathing sword sound for an axe
The more they show of this, the better it looks. I'm still a bit skeptical, but its looking pretty good
Remember how people who didn't like JK spoiled the end of Hogwarts legacy....
This is the trailer that we should’ve seen from the beginning. NOW, I’m interested.
Gameplay looks better everytime I see it. Pausing the game to choose your teammates attacks is very similar to the Mass Effect games. I love it. Eventhough you can't take control of your teammates, it still feels like you have more control over what they do, compared to DA:I
LFG!!!!!!!!
This looks so bad lmfao
The companions look & feel very useless outside of the pause command 😐 The transition from gameplay to cutscene (and vice versa) looks smooth though
Hours ago I was wondering how dragon fights where going to be like thank you for answering my question dragon age
Anyone who says this looks like Fortnite can go eat a sock.
Did you see guys such a clean hub you can turn off or turn on the attack numbers the button indicators, pretty cool.
WE ARE SO BACK
Rook the second Dragon hit the Warden Forward camp
So. Pumped.  Been years since I was so stoked for an upcoming game!
Love this game so much😍
we eatin good
I was thinking that we were going to watch 2 billions of videos from gamers boasting about how they killed the dragon in less than 5 seconds (like the billions of videos of Inquisitors killing dragons I've seen since now) when Ghilan'nain appeared and it's the first time I see her so well and, oh wow, isn't she majestic? My jaw dropped downstairs
Ugly characters like from a mobile game. Horrible dragon design, that horrible cartoon style. The gameplay is primitive. Unfortunately Bioware is officially dead. There's no need to wait for a new Mass Effect.
TAAAAASH
I hope that was a trans dragon. I didn't see its scars!
Holy shit that looked epic
Mage looks absolutely awesome, that void spell!? Chefskiss
Wow did we just see the graphics and animations of hmm 2016? It’s not even 2014+ - it’s not for nothing that the game was made for so many years
This is going to be so much fun!!! 😅
Well I'm officially sold on my class of choice...Mage!
Mommy?
Who's here before Asmongold's Darkspawn (fans) get here?
what was the point of constructing balistas right outside of watchtower when they know well that it's too close?
Ahhhhhhhh!!!!
Soo did you guys turn down the particle effects? because I approve of that the last trailer with gameplay was deleting my eyes. At least one more thing that bothers me less.
The character creator alone is reason enough not to buy this game.
Woooo!
I can't wait to play as an elf to see what Ghilan'nain and Elgar'nan would react when I kill them.
garbage
I always played like a mage in Dragon Age World and I loved it. But this time I feel the mage is like a solo player, I think the class is more agile and aggressive. I can't wait until 10/31.... to me the perfect candidate for GOTY
Damn, trailers sucks but these gameplay trailers are fire for sure. Looks like we will have great game once again
Hype Nice Game🤩🤩
More a mobile game than a PC one
I'm very excited :D
Holy crap I am so FRIKKEN' EXCITED!!! Halloween can't come fast enough!!
Love that Rook armor!
Holy fuck the amount of bot comments on here.
Who else took the PTO already --->
YES!!!!
This comment section is full of bots lol
Dragon fight looks SO good!!!
Oh look  someone can play the game correctly  and almost made it seem enjoyable and showed a epic fight  good job  must not be a IGN footage this time haha  ... not getting my hopes up yet  but a little of my faith is restored in Bio ware games
Game looks like shit, the graphics are the worst by far. Thanks for screwing over dragon age.
I can’t take these characters seriously. They all look so Disney. Where are the masculine looking characters and the feminine females? I don’t understand why EA would approve this.
Hell yeah!!! Can't Wait!!!
I love this game and the internet trolls will never drown out how excited literally everyone else is to play it!!! Thanks for making such a cool game!
This game looks tragic!
So companions are immortal and they do 0 damage.   And the entire mage gameplay is Blink, Auto, Blink,  Auto, Blink, Blink, Auto, Use an ability (that barely did any damage), Blink, Auto, Blink  How exciting, truly lessons have been learned (sarcasm for those that can't tell)
I can’t wait for this!!!
YESSS LETS GO DRAGON AGE ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
GOTY
Liara?
why is Ghilan'nain kinda hot!??? oh no....
Ummm is that a REAPER???
This looks dope af
I'm glad to see the UI is customizable enough to be rid of all that unnesscary bloat we've witnessed in released footage so far! Hooray for Dragon Age!
Ignoring all the "self insert" nonsense with the character creator, once your actually playing the game it looks fun. Just wished playing the game didn't come with this constant nagging feeling that politics is going to rear it's ugly head at some point during my playthrough and breaking immersion because I was hella immersed here.  Edit rewatched: 1:03 Taash got me sweating over here. She looked so good here. They've been doing her wrong with previous angles and she has such a cute voice too.
Environment design is pretty bad. This builds no atmosphere. Is the memory budget that bad?
I really hate ghilanain 😂 (however you spell it) but I am ready for this game.
I’m really struggling to decide which class to play, every time I see gameplay of one class, it makes me want to play that one lol!
No boobs, no butts, no buy. The inclusive character creator excludes a lot of NORMAL people.
can't wait to romance Ghilan'nain once my pre order arrives.
Can't frigging wait!!! ❤
uhh ghilly look great, and thats just act 1 mhh
This honestly looks amazing!! I cannot wait to lose myself in the new and improved world of Ferelden!!
HYPE ITS OVER 9000!!
This combat looks so fun. I can't wait for this game to come out. Already preordered (my first time preordering ever!)
Bioware is back finally it took you long enough
Absolutely AMAZING !!! can't wait for this !!!
Right. They never implemented 2 dragons at once fight.   Before it was dragons calling their minion/children.  But I still wish the companion actually do damage (or at least we can turn on the damage counter for companion to out worry at ease)
This looks so cool :D Erhm I mean...*ahem*...Woke, libtard trash! Who wants this?! Gaming is dead!
Please for the love of god tell me there are still optional dragons to fight.. That was the best part of the whole game of Inquisition.
I can't unsee the big heads now 😂😂
YES
That looks so fun.
*Me seeing Ghilan'nain:* "I fear a new gay icon just appeared... This is a potential mother".
Oh my gahhhhhhh I cannot wait!!!
This 💩 looks good!!
Is asmongold keep criticizing this combat idk man, THIS IS DOPE AF
Words can’t even begin to describe how EXCITED I am to play this game!! My heart has been restored, we are so back!! 🫶🏼💕
IS IT HALLOWEEN YET!?
😱😱😱💜💜💜
Dragon Age is soulslike now? It's so over...
Cool that we got a darker piece shown this time!
sure there's controversy with the character creator and style choices... But I'm not gonna lie, This story looks sick & got me pretty pumped
GAME LOOKS GOOD, HAS A STRONG DEMAND ON MULTIPLE PLATFORMS AND TRACKING WELL WITHIN SALE EXPECTATIONS.   WE HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE BACK!!!
IT LOOKS AWESOME THANK YOUUU
I can’t wait!!!!! Dragon Age is all I can think about at the moment, I’m so hyped
At last we are going back to the darker roots of dragon age
Ghilan’nain romance when?
whats this quality of animation? - PS2??
ghilan'nain is a fucking menace
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck. This looks awesome. Taash doesn't sound like what I expected at all. (Better honestly, way to go VA!) Combat feels weighty. Love the scrunchy bridge of the nose thing when characters are pissed. Whoever designed that feature, you're a legend.
SO many fucking shills.
Wow, you managed to improve the dragon fighr. Really really really good, the voice acting is top tier
Yo, get rid of the director and its acolytes to heal Dragon Age.
From  the words of the prince of saiyans mine mine mine mine mine this video  epic I can't  wait
This looks stunning. They let Ghilan'nain cook AND serve. Haven't been this excited about a game release in years
I don't like to wish my tine away, but I really need it to be Halloween already.
lolol dumb n dumber should be the names of those two dragons.  This is so bad.
October 31st going to be epic Halloween for me after i mkae it out of character creation.😍😊😊
the art style is definitely growing on me
Now this is what I'm talking about, Ghilan'nain looks badass, and this mage gameplay is much better than before. Can't wait.
This gameplay looks better and more refined than the previous showcases, and not just because of the dragon, but also due to the context and presentation. Very cinematic.
Ghilan'nain...<chills>
Looks sick, glad the Dragon combat is reminiscent of Inquisition's.
So is Ghilan'nain single, or...
My body is so ready for this
This looks insanely good and holy fuck the horror looks incredible. Her coming out from the ground like that???? October 31st can't come quick enough.
Elgar'nan must be getting jealous; Ghil is getting all the attention over here.
Im a huge Dragon Age fan played all 3 games im so excited for VeilGuard my Canon Playthrough My Grey Warden Warrior Ginger Ponytail and Small Beard Cousland Romancing Morrigan Has a Kid Kieran Alive and Well,  My Male Rouge Hawke Short Black hair and big Beard Romancing Merill and My Male Quanari Inquisitior Warrior Romancing Cassandra I cant wait to see him again in VeilGuard i am officially decided to do a Female Mage i don't know if i want Human or Elf yet and to Romance is either Harding or Tassah The female Quanari i am so excited for Halloween playing this game 🎮 pre ordered it im so hyped for this ill take another letter from my Warden in this game if his wife Morrigan is in this game i really want a Cameo of my Warden
Wow i bet all those losers complaining abt the first look trailer from this summer are pissed now
Holy damn this looks so good. I love the minimal UI for the fight! And the dagger and orb mage gameplay? Top tier player right there, looks like a cinematic!  I'm so glad I pre-ordered the game, and I can't wait for the 31st of October!
Okay it looks amazing and all but I'm most hyped for the ACTUAL LONG HAIR THANK YOU. Also the physics of it are beautiful
I cannot understand people hating on this
WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Так говно ещё не пахло
peridot mamaaaaaaa we are about to slay and strut into Thedas with all the cvntiness i fearrr x
This looks SO FUCKING GOOD OMG WE’RE SO BACK!!!!
If this is the spoiler stuff they are comfortable showing us just what do they have up their sleeve?!
Ghilan'nain looks so good!! Can’t wait for 31 October, I need it now!🥹💕
women looks like a men who takes oestrogen and men looks like women who takes testoterone
Looks outstanding
Great trailer!!! Now i dont know if i play mage or warrior tbh
I can fix Ghilan'nain, I love her already!
I'm getting my first Xbox Series X in October, and I'm just as excited about the console as I am about Veilguard. I feel like it will be a very personal and immersive experience.
holy shiiiiit i need to sleep until halloween
The combat looks so cool ! I love it
Hype hype hype hype 😍😍😍😍😍
The game without all that UI looks soooo sick!!!
Is that Evka in the beginning???!!!
Im clawing at my calendar at time itself to go faster!!
This has me SCREAMINNGG looks so good
Gilly gurlllllll
counting down the days until my preorder shows up to dl on steam!
Ghilin'nain is scary as hell. This shit rules.   Also, at 3:45, was she about to pull that Warden apart with her four arms like a Goro fatality? I hope that was just cut for the trailer cuz that'd be sick.
That scene looked epic. Definitely looking forward to the game.
**shrieks with fangirly joy**
Ahaha the tentacle back slap
GOTY
i'm so worried after playing DAI
Ok fine. You win. My mage class looks to be freaking awesome to play as and that does look damn fun. I'll probably get it on day 2.
Mediocre at best. I just hope they prove me wrong. Nothing really grabs my attention. The companions just seem a little flat to me.
Poor Wardens don't get a break, every game they're getting screwed in a different way
That is awesome! So hard to decide wich class i'll choose on my first playthrough   Also, love seeing more Taash
the music!!! the soundeffects!!!
Game has been pre-ordered and the next day has been taken off of work. Halloween weekend is gonna be amazing 😭🙌
Having a hard time focusing on the games I'm currently playing because I'm too excited for this.  Have a long weekend set aside it and can't wait!
As we say in Portuguese: nunca fui triste. The game looks amazing. I can't wait to play it.
Let's F-ing GOOOOO!!!!
I believe in Bioware, and it feels exhilarating to be able to do so. I hope you guys pull it off this Halloween, this game is shaping up to be great ❤
Will take a while to learn this pronunciation of Ghilan'nain but worth it!
Loved every dragon age before this and this looks great. I'm so hyped after inquisition. I get there's a lot to criticize especially with games these days and sure maybe DA:TV deserves some but it's getting so much unnecessary draining hate tbh.. like I was sceptical after the first trailer but now I can't wait! most of the haters aren't even gonna give it a chance and that's usually the case the past few years
incredible 😍
This looks awesome
Natural20letsfuckinggo!
WE'RE SO BACK
holy fuck, this looks fun!
60usd+ 60% impuestos en Argentina, muy caro, sería medio sueldo. Sin precio regional y el Estado robándonos casi imposible comprar
Hooooly shit. I cannae wait
Ewww  look at these uglyy characters 😂
The game was more promising and near to be the dragon age that we all remember and wanted, when that name was DreadWolf
Did that soldier had make up?
Anyone else notice the Qunari actually looked normal here? And the gameplay looks insane!
3:46 Ghilan'nain. The true "Mother" of the Blight
Can it be Halloween day now please!!? I need this game right nowwwww
Ahhh I can‘t wait!!!
Dragon Age forever!!
Holy shit that was awesome. Music is top notch as well!
😭😭 THAT WAS EPIC!!!
Yessss
so excited 😍
Great trailer! I'm cautiously optimistic about this game. Sure the woke fuckery in the game is very annoying but the combat looks great and the story seems very interesting.
LEEGGGOOOOO 🤩🤩🤩🤩I CAN’T WAIT FOR HALLOWEEN TO GET HERE
Это было круто! Ждём игру всем селом)🎉🎉🎉
OH THEY JUMPCUT THE SCENE YOU CAN TELL OF HER RIPPING A GUY IN HALF
looks terrible lol
Amazing new trailer! Wardens, epic dragon fight, great mage gameplay! (and ofc Lucanis :P)  Soooo...that's how Ghilan'nain looks. Seems like she's done more experiments on herself than on her creatures. Just wished she talked elven!
It looks so good, and I can already tell this game is going to have some of the best music in the series
Bioware out here makin Ghilan'nain a baddie and hot... I see you Veilguard. Mother Monster indeed...
I cant wait to play my preorder, Oct 31st hurry up and get here.
Goty!!!! ❤🎉🎉
oh my godddddddd
There are things that I liked now but Voice acting really disappoints me...  and weird and stiff expressions for me those are very important points
Dragon Age Inquisition battles look better
Wow. This looks amazing.
I hope combat is more involved than this, already we saw the main character spam-cycle the same sequence of attacks a couple of times and that will get old fast with so few skills to break up that cycle. Suppose combat is one of those things you have to try yourself, everything else looks lovely.
I can't wait to get started!
So hyped
THIS LOOKS RAD AS FUCK IF I'M BEING REAL WITH YOU
too much. stop showing spoilers
Holy crap that was epic. We are so back. ❤❤❤❤
Is it the 31st yet!?!❤❤❤
i do not care about the game anymore. You fack the game
First EA game I'm gonna buy since Mass Effect Legendary Edition. Looks amazing.
Looks like they’re doing a new rook each trailer  That’s a first anyone’s done that for a game  I wonder if it’s gonna culminate with a big trailer with all of them
THIS WAS SICK , also heard pre orders are meeting EAs expectations which usually mean  1. They were reasonable for once 2. They met unreasonable expectations lmao
GIVE TO MEEEEEE 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Ghil is gonna bring the body horror vibes, lets get it
Can you fix the smooth Qunari please ? Thanks
W gameplay
People praising this gameplay clearly never played Monster Hunter World, a game that came out 6 years ago..
OMG what did I just witness! This is INSANE!!!
The real song of ice and fire
IM SO EXCITEDDDDD
This looks friggin awesome
Ghil in full form!!! Ahhhhh! Plus a fight with a blighted dragon. My god. This game is proving to be 100% beyond anything I could have remotely hoped for. Thank you, Bioware team!
Nice to see high level mage combat in a dragon fight! Excited to play next month!
Look at all this paid bots in the comments 😂😂😂 damn AI is really taking over Internet
Why doesn’t the dragon have top surgery scars? That’s not very inclusive 😢
WOOO! LET’S GOOO!   GET THAT DRAGON, ROOK!!!
You've heard of first dragon, yes - but what about second dragon??
Yoooo!!! BIOWARE!!!!!! Stop this teasing shit & just give us the game! My heart cannot take it 😭

Congratulations on the high demand for the game and yhe strong preorder sales this far. ❤❤❤ 4 more weeks left

Dragon Age™: Female Edition
Nice!
It’s sad that for Akira Toriyama if he were still here he said so himself he had projects and movie he still was working on and would of course kept making more Dragon Ball Movies and maybe even continue DBS Super based on his last interview he for sure was planning to make another Dragon Ball story after Dragon Ball Daima but sadly it’s his last Dragon Ball work from the great Master who created Dragon Ball. I hope Toyotaro with Toei Animations and maybe Hiroyuki Sakurada production team will help either way happy for Dragon Ball franchise but sad at the same time!
AE AGORA SIM PAGARAM O MARKETING!!!
Game will break records of all video games ❤️🐐🙏
