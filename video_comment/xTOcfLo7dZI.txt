Lol - great short 😊👍
Check your pockets Derek always practices preaching "we need more robberies".
👌
Usyk probably got more fans than fury and AJ put together these days. Gurantee if you ask most people who they prefer most will say Usyk as he’s such a likeable bloke
😂😂😂😂
Two funny guys!!!
😂😂😂😂
😂

There is no other way...we have to love this man...Usyk is simply great❤

These two belong in a comedy.
2 crazy lovable guys,going to miss both when they are gone.❤❤❤
My friend is convinced to this day Derek got robbed vs Usyk. I wouldn’t go that far but he definitely gave him a run for his money and came the closest to winning out of anyone
Class 😂
Your punch drunk Derek

Two top guys
Who else is here before this blows up

Is that Mario? Issa meeee, your hairline is a mysteryyyyy
At this point rhey should all retire and on fight nights just let Usyk in the eing, to, i dunno, to fwnce or something 😂 cos yrying to fight him is just pointless 😂
Don't push the horses.
The size of the back of his hands when he’s slicking his hair back is terrifying.
Derek and usyl both national  treasure respect them guys
very honest question and very honest answer!
The UK King is a Ukrainian.  And we all Love him to Bits!!
The UK Assassin 😂 British boxers call him daddy 🤣
Hahaha he replied so quickly with no I love both these legends
😂😂😂
Derek probably gave Usyk his hardest heavyweight fight
😂😂😂😂No
Brilliant
Like NO damn!!!
don push the horses
Like two kids using AI to make them look old
Usyk is one of those guys you want to be friends with ❤
Professional Sports man, great personality
This is going straight into my favorites playlist
Derek what are you!?
I ve had this on repeat all day
The Warlord and The Cat are top drawer class
*laughs in pay per view*
Usyk,come here,nd u will see .
Piss off Derek  get in the que
I didn t expect to love this as much as I do
Hardly! 😂😂
when crazy meets crazier
Much nicer to see Usyk than Tyson Fury
Why are all becoming gay towards Usyk. What's so classy about him? He's a good dude and a hell of a boxer. So still, why are you gay?
The LDBC ARE SEETHING WATCHING THIS😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Got to so love usky
😆 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Remember when chisora said he could beat usyk, now he is fan girling
What's funny is that usyk insists on a translator during press interviews when you know he speaks English fluently.  Power move
🤣🤣🤣🤣
This deserves way more views. Absolutely underrated
The sweetest boxer ever :) cool dude
I ve had this on repeat all day
😂😂😂 the nicest bully ever 😂😂😂
This gave me chills… in the best way
The problem is that this generation of the HW division its full of such mediocre boxers.
Verstappen
Pure talent. No words
Dude for a second i thought it was jon jones
Nice one from my champions
Algorithm finally did something right
ROCKY AND APOLLO❤
Mood instantly lifted. Thank you for this
Couldn't of said said No any quicker 😂
😂😂😂😂
. Big respect and thanks to the big men for entertaining and inspiring us. May God keep you all safe and continue to bless you and your families. 🙏🏾
Usyk's humility and down-to-earth personality is just amazing!
😅🥊😂🫵🏿🤣🫡👊🏿💜🪽
Best HW of my lifetime. 💯
This gave me chills… in the best way
Champ usyk 🔥❤️
Usyk is always very humble, i think he’s a really good guy
I can't stop laughing and watching this video 😂 big guys cooking legacy joke
Love this 😂😂😂
I didn t expect to love this as much as I do
Nice that init 😊
😂😂😂love usyk ❤❤
Your consistency is inspiring—keep going
This is going straight into my favorites playlist
Usyk is beating more groes than a 1930s sheriff in a sundown town.
😂😂😂doubled down on 5 brits Alexander the Great
You would have thought he was fighting in the Ukraine with that crowd. UK have taken him into their hearts with his humble stance & phenomenal skill. Champion in & out of the ring.I get the impression he loves the UK back. 🥊
Its ur friendly neighbourhood boxer Usykman
Usyk is class best boxer av Eva seen in my life time.
Gente grande del Deporte casi nada el mejor Boxeador de todos los tiempos.
Imagine asked by Chisora to stop beating him up 😂😂
This video randomly popped up and I m glad it did
I love usyk he's such a character
Never thought id be a boxing fan.... but this man hard to not fan boy over😅😂
Universal champion, Universal nice guy.....nice bit of comedy by Del 👍🏻
Who is on  Usyk T shirt
Trop bon cet humble mec ❤
This gave me chills… in the best way
What a guy😂
Britian and Ukraine 🇬🇧🇺🇦💪✝️🙏
I love Usyk... great fighter and down-to-Earth bloke.
good to see you both sharing happiness
This is going straight into my favorites playlist
Na
😂😂😂
I ve had this on repeat all day
This just shows what the sport of boxing is actually all about - It’s beautiful… Its respect…
Usyk he is a funny guy😂
Makes all the British fighters look lazy and slow! Oh actually they are... lazy and slow!
Usyk is a dude
Looks like he ain’t been touched 😂
There good friends Derek  and usyk are so funny
Usyk obliterated 2 brits in front of their home crowd and got cheered that’s a true champion right there reminds me of creed where Adonis went to Russia to fight dragon got boos but in the end got cheers
probably the 2 most humble fighters out there
That was such a lovely thing to watch, because out of respect… It was honest,humerous and they both were friends
Ukrainians can fight and end up champions in boxing and dominate for years. Imagen going to war with them😂 russia knows if they have Ukraine on their side they win any war but they can’t so they thought submission was a good tactic, dickheads
❤🥊🥊🏆
Chisora joking his way to another juicy paycheck😭
Derek's a genuinely nice guy. He played a bit of a character in press conferences in his younger days, but he's one of the few likeable guys
These 2 😂😂😂
He cant beat Agit
Amazing
People talk about Derek being Usyk’s “toughest” fight. It’s true in the sense that Usyk was still acclimating to the heavyweight ranks. Was there ever a chance that he was going to lose that fight? No.
Usky is british
You just earned a new subscriber
That part at 2:45 Instant goosebumps
Mood instantly lifted. Thank you for this
I love the fact that the baddest man on the planet is just a humble joker:)
Derek..Derek.. I am come for you Derek 😂😂..
Mood instantly lifted. Thank you for this
He’s officially adopted by the British public! We love him ❤️
Usyk is the nicest person in the world of sport! The end
Usyk is a British treasure ! Love the guy 😂❤️
Pure talent. No words
True champ ,  my kids look up to him..couldn't be a better role model
😂 yes he said NO
😅😅😅😅😅
the brother is feel, weeery wery feel
😹....Derek, don't push the horses!💥🤣
If you don’t like Usyk…you’re the problem
Algorithm finally did something right
Parker next please usyk
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
💯🔥
He still looks like a very young man to me, long live Usyk.
Good to see it’s only a sport
This video randomly popped up and I m glad it did
Ysyk got real...❤😊
That will be a great friendship between them
Tbh Chisora got the least punishment from usyk in the ring 😂
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
That part at 2:45 Instant goosebumps
champ
“Can u stop beating us up” (meaning black people) Usyk “no” 😭😂
😂😂😂😂
No wonder the British government and people are using Ukrainians to help them fight Russia 😂
Might be the funniest thing I've ever heard.
This is going straight into my favorites playlist
The father and Son encounter is absolute bullsh*t. Okay Jack, you ran after it but you was terrified
You gotta respect usyk and the career he's had 👍🙏
Generational funny guy.

Uskys: hardest punch Derek Del Chisora💯 the king 🤴
Derek loves a bit of banter! Congratulations Oleksander that was an outstanding performance yet again.
To funny ☝🏾💯🤣👍🏾🫵🏾
Good guys!
Usyk really knows how to turn it on during the fight and then turn off the warrior inside of him once it’s over and just be a funny guy and good family man. I knew he was going to make a statement in the heavyweight division, but I didn’t know he’d be this dominate. Usyk reminds of a slightly slower and not as great footwork Muhammad Ali. They literally have about the same size frame that Ali had in his prime of 6’3” 215-225 pounds
Deeeeeeeeerrrreeeeeeeeeeeeekkkk
scripted, but needed, good banter
Mood instantly lifted. Thank you for this
Pure man ❤it’s not hard to be nice 🤷‍♂️or real🤔this bloke does it genuinely 👏👏🤚
I don't get it but I'm happy that they've having fu6
For some reason Del Boy is respected by Usyk they even went for lunch on Sunday
Usyk has that look in his eyes 👀 scary
Chisora gave him one of the hardest fights
try offer Usyk british citizenship :D
Love it what a guy usyk is and Delboy a legend himself
😂😂😂😂😂
❤пріча❤..
In a world of absolute wankers where bravado is key, Usyk leads the way to be sound. And he’s the best.
That's a good one ! 😂
Goat
Takksport scum
Hard asf can’t take it away from him hats off sir 👊🏻👊🏻
Are these 2 guys the coolest boxers of all time… amazing ❤
He's a true champ I'd love to see him give del boy his 50th fight
He's fought in England so much he's an honorary brit if he wants it no doubt 😂 i swear i heard quite a few chants for him at Wembley
El mejor de todos y de todos los tiempos, más que Mohamed Ali
Derek was the only one to give him a go
No
Brilliant!
This is quality, the best characters in the heavyweight!!
Hope they don't fight. Biggest mismatch since Epstein and the girls who visited his island
Usyk is a true world champion.
What an amazing human being Usyk is. A generational talent for sure  and one of the best boxers I’ve ever seen in my life. He’s top 3 for sure!!😊
SOME people just see Chisora as this bit of a joke  Boxer, but he aint really. Lots in the Boxing world have a respect for him and he's quite a funny man with a personality
This is why the world loves Ukrainians!
💪🏽🇺🇦awesome
He said NAH 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 this guy is naturally funny without even trying
The way you explained this is SO clear. Thank you
MANN,,, THATT IS THE RITE ANN PROPPA WAYY TO TAKE ITT,,,   JUSST A GOOD ANN PROPPA ATTITUDE,,, ANND YESSS FO SHUURRE,,,, SUTCH A VERRRYYY LIKEABLE KIDD USYK IS,,  FROMM JONNTY WICKSON SOUTH YORKSHIRE ENGLAND
This video randomly popped up and I m glad it did
I ve had this on repeat all day
😂
Legend
Usyk has been trolling everybody for years. He's actually called Dave from Wolverhampton and doesn't speak a word of Ukranian. He's not even a boxer... he works at Tesco.
lil rabbit , please stop beating us all up
Pure talent. No words
I can t stop smiling watching this
😂
I think derek stands a chamce...he is a worrior that will swing and get hit and carry on swinging
I learned more in 10 minutes than hours of Googling
We've sent everyone now and he's beat them all up 😂
So cool😎
Algorithm finally did something right
big up usyk
Says a lot about how likeable Usyk is that I don't see any British fight fans hating on him, even though he slaps up all our top talent 😅
Your consistency is inspiring—keep going
this was classy from both of them.
😂😂😂😂😂😂. He hasn't fought me
In rd 5 when Usyk hurt Dubois the atmosphere was amazing, most support was for Usyk. When we left the stadium we walked past some police horses and I heard a voice behind me in the crowd saying "don't push the horses" haha.
Chisora changed so much...great to see
I can t stop smiling watching this
2 of the toughest to lace up in our era total respect to the both of you.. thank u both for all the moments in the sport u have gave this era.. Legends, Icon's, Role models, Inspirational individuals
Gotta love Usyk ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
😂😂😂
You just earned a new subscriber
The king is here ❤
Hilarious 😅😅😅

😂
This gave me chills… in the best way
hahahahahahahhahaha this is the most funniest moment i have ever seen in the history boxing
Lovely moment
Love it!!
Derek's a bit of a dick really
If you're gonna get utterly beat and outclassed you couldn't hope for a nicer guy to do it to you. You can't begrudge him lol
Usyk is so likeable. A rare phenomenon within all the fake trash talkers in boxing.
❤️❤️
Usyk is great, but is it just me or is the competition poor these days?
Insane to think a cruiserweight can take over the heavyweight division. That’s how good he is. Others have tried with limited success. Uysk is on another level.
Brilliant video
hilarious that 😂😂😂
This video randomly popped up and I m glad it did
❤❤❤❤❤
That was hella funny 😂
Top guy top boxer
He is a true champ❤💪
Hahaha “Na”
lol
Funny fuckers 😂😂
Who else is here before this blows up
That transition at 3:12 was chefs kiss
🤣🤣
This gave me chills… in the best way
Lovely
Usyk has such a great personality. Love this guy. He is a true role model.
Mood instantly lifted. Thank you for this
He wasn't to my liking but after this fight he is the best best fighter his southpaw is just so amazing and skills are above a d Dubois is a good fighter buy Usyk is special.
How fury had the beans to call him ugly is hilarious
Usek. Seems like an awesome character
Hes feeling 😂🎉
Algorithm finally did something right
Черт
Joseph Parker!!!
I learned more in 10 minutes than hours of Googling
Your consistency is inspiring—keep going
What a good sport lol
2 warriors 2 great sportsmen credit to their countries and credit to boxing.
It is not about where a man is from it is about his character! Both great men and Usyk is a legend and someone so good as a rolemodel to look up to, how he carries himself is just pure class and his workrate and discipline are quite frankly to me is inspiring.
Absolute Legends!
It is extremely unlikely to find anyone like Usyk. This guy is truly one of a kind. THUMBS UP! FOR CHISORA...
USYK is an AWESOME CHAMPION! Unlike Fury and others I can sit down with my GRANDCHILDREN & watch  a world CHAMPION without concern over his language  etc. Thank you Champ!
🤣🤣
I swear usyk has 4 arms !
This is going straight into my favorites playlist
These 2 always joking about😂
Derek its bedtime grandad
I feel!!!
I was and still am a Fury fan but goddamn Usyks made me like him more. Mike Tyson, Ali then Usyk, GOATS
Саня ты красавчик а друга незнаю
Derek you're a good man. That's why Usyk likes you.
Most accessible champion! Never liked him but he’s the best ever and so humble. More humble than Leo Messi is scary
😂😂😂.. Original
The Greatest! People’s champ. Ukraine must be very proud of him. Go Usyk!
Derek the journeyman bum with 13 losses😂😂😂
Tough warriors giggle like little 12 year-old girls hilarious
Chisora is a leech
best of the best for the all time
D E R E E E K
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Samo na možete.popušiti.ako vam dadnemo😂❤🎉
isn't this racism?
Probably the greatest of all time never been beaten
LOVE YOU GUYS ! THE BEST ! XXXXX
lol Legends ♥♥
2 KOOL dudes❤😂
Usyk the goat
😂😂😂❤
Theirs something special about Usyk. Well done
Hahahahahahaha brilliant
For a man that's had 350 amateur fights , I think 24 pro fights, his face is in amazing condition. That shows how good he is , superb movement .
Understood that well enough 😂.
D9nt push the horses
I love usyk even more since he got confident speaking English. One of the very best to ever put gloves on and a proper down to earth family man
Luv you guys 🥊🥊🥊
"can u stop beating us all" "gimme fury then"
Usyk owns British boxers 😂
Tbf Derek gave him a good fight!
Best quote of the British boxing era
His a real champion 🏆
Tru true  talk  Derek ❤😂
Love usyk man, great guy
Quality 😀
Donkey 🐓 whos the Donkey 🐴
The GOAT ……. By a long way
Chisora or Parker...... Nobody, NOBODY wants to see another Fury or AJ fight as long as we live!
BOTH LEGENDS
😆🤩👊😆✌️
5 guys
😂 legend
Usyk smashed all british heavyweights there is only one man out there who cann beat Usyk and it is the Kurdish Lion Agit Kabayel.
Usyk is simply class!!!
Usyk is more popular with British fans than any British boxer
Most humble world champion ever ❤
All hail Sir Usyk
😂😂😂😂😂
Usyk taking the absolute piss out of everyone at the moment ha ha
And Usyk has beaten all his greatest ops twice in heavyweight that's crazy work in boxing🥊💯
Derrick piss off
Надоело смотреть на етих миллиардеров
From an English man, I have so much respect for Usyk. What an absolute boxer he is. Unbelievable and 100% best boxer in the world right now. How can you not love the guy.
It’s super hard to find athlete more likeable the Usyk. The best
SlavaUkrainia 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦
Tysonfuryistheman to beat him guaranteed 😅
49 fights and has never been a world champion.  WHAT A FU**ING BUM!
I love Usyk 😂. What. A. Fighter.
The responds was super sharp 😂
That’s so funny😅
Pure respect 😂
The best today is usyk Crawford and Artur
I think Crawford can challenge him lost or win
😂😂😂😊😢😂
Brilliant 😅😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Best fighter of this pispoor era of boxing
i hope he sends some money to help ppl in ukraine , since he made over 130mln   for that fight
They're actually friends! I love this
Hahahaha, he is a legend
True sportsmanship from the ✌
Delboy is the only opponent who sincerely likes usyk
Uysk putting BELT 2 Ah
That was top notch!
Who next then??... My moneys on Jake Paul or the Hawk Tuah girl 👌😂😂
😂😂😂😂
Lol
Usyk has developed a discipline unknown amongst British fighters. His integrity comes from deep inside out. You can’t but respect and admire him as a huMAN.
shame!
"nah!" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I wonder if Usyk knows just how well respected he is in the UK?
It’s crazy as I see him as us ? Is this what the dudes in the Ukraine are like ? I thought they was more stoic like Russians
Usyk deserved a nice KO after all of the stupid Fury clinching.
I love this. Two boxers who have fought each other that can have a laugh about it 😅
Derek probably done the best out of al the Brit’s
😁😁😁😁😁😁
😂😂😂 love this two guys
you must love this champ
2 legends
I love these guys
He is the king of boxing. No travellers come close.
My favourite boxer to watch of all time usyk.
He did a interview saying why do we think we can beat him he has misslies going over his house back home. You need to be mad to fight him😂😂
😂😂😂don't push the horses
I know he’s a great fighter. But why all of a sudden we are hating on our own fighters? Unless they are fighting against each other. Obviously we have our favourite fighter. Imagine putting in all that hard work. Biggest fight of your life. Home soil and your getting hated by you home crowd. Confident blower as soon as you walk out… fighters need the backing of their own supporters but we don’t. Can you stop beating us up and laughs…
So likeable. I'm pleased he taught DD a manners lesson after his ring invasion.
That’s Jon jones
Brilliant 👌
А теперь перчатки вешай и едь  свой народ спасай от власти
Usyk is a genuine guy, humorous, no ego, no arrogance, just a phenomenal boxing talent
Boss
Gonna go down as one of the very best
Usyk is the nicest guy and all round legend I don't think he can be beat he will retire unbeaten 👏👏👏
Can you go and fight Putin for you’re country
I love this
Usyk is 1 of our own we adopted him years back delboy lol
Usyk😂😊💪🫡
Gay
Usyk is fuking awesome. He’s the heavyweight champion we all deserve. Thank you Champ.
Lol usyk is brilliant
hoo nest...?
Good sports, both of them.
Nice to see from Derek for  a change
He meant it thought
AJ and Derek both accepted this guy is too good and befriended him
I love my British opponents
😂
No 😂😂
Man with God and Holy Mary will never lose🙏
Love these guys top class blokes
So nows its 1 -1 dubois beat him first time
☝🏻😁💪🏻🇺🇦👍🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻✊🏻
Usyk is a super star man; he’s totally down to earth.
😂 I just became a fan
😂😂😂
😂😂😂🙌🏻
He’s a proper gent. Loved by Ukrainians (and my Ukrainian) wife. He epitomises the Ukrainian spirit - hard work, determination, family and community.
Na 🤣🤣
Love ya Usyk 🇺🇦🇬🇧.
Brilliant!!😂😂
to be fair, Chisora gave Sasha one of the toughest runs
Chisora got the 1947 written on his cap, pakistan independence day 😂
Usyk plz knock out jake Paul for us hopefully Joshua does it would be embarrassing if he loses to jake 😂😂😂
Nah 😂😂😂
Usyk❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ok that was funny
😅
Wow they look like they’ve just had real tough fight, boxing is a joke corrupt beyond belief.
The only injury sustained in the DD fight was his hair got messed up.
Je vous AIME tous les deux 😊❤
Masha-Allah 🎉🎉🎉great
This is brilliant!😂😂😂
Out of all the Brits Derek gave him the best fight  👍👍
Two great personalities
He’s now one of ours “nah” 😂
Gotta love Derek
Chisoras a cool guy he loves usyk to cool friends.
Love usky he’s brilliant
Watched 10 times
Usyk rocks
Nice one, on the other end, British Boxers should give Usyk his flowers, respect him as a true legend 😂
Lol 😂
What a kind gesture usyk
This is funny....love it
😂😂
На нуль у  Же роботи нима хай ще повоюе
He's being funny with the "nah" but he's being serious af aswell 😂😂😂,he's made everyone look like they have never boxed before....TWICE each 😂😂 what a lovely guy aswell.
Chisora trying to stay relevant by any means necessary,  even licking Uysks cucumber now!
LoL
Imagine the plot twist.....Oleksander fights his 'best friend' Derek next. 'Loses' to Chisora, who then becomes the Undisputed Heavyweight Champion. Both men then retire immediately...laughing in the faces of us mere mortals....!❤
🎉
Usyk is a proper g 😂
Classic reply
Great guy
Wgaf about delivery boy
Gotta love Chisora hahaha
😂
Love it
super
Think they have nice friendship. Congratulations champ!
Lol Usyk knew exactly the best way to beat a already beat DDD. Put it right on him he crumbles under pressure and Usyk did just that. What a fighter.
Derek is the only one that gave him a fight
Love them both for this
Now I’m beginning to like Derek Chisora for being humble.
I just woke up and wifie is like "who's texting you " 😂😂😂 this video is cracking me up 😂😂😂I'm lmao
Wow beautiful love you guys the two legend ❤❤
Cant not like em ✊🏿😂
ORTHODOX
😅😂😅😂😅😂
Reason why he didnt fight dereck twice 😂
Brilliant!!👏 😂
Usyk is nothing but pure class both as a phenomenal boxer and as a human being.  In my opinion, top five of all time.
Living legend 🙌
Uskys way to good for this generation of boxers. Uskys level is made for Tysons and Alis Era. Uskys is just to good for these guys. Dubois gave it a good go, I think Dubois tried to hard.
Lol😂😂
Usyk and chisora are both legends of the sport of Boxing. 🇮🇪🥊
Chisora came closest to beating him at Heavyweight
Funny he's got a couple of Na3is on his t shirt and the British public love this great boxer but a Na4i cnt
If Usyk was the best fighter that has ever lived,He would have been a top comedian ❤❤
The editing is top-tier. Seriously impressive
Derek Chisora; “Oga, issokay nau.” 😆
It should really tell you something that a Ukrainian can sell out Wembley Stadium against pretty much anyone at this point. A modern day GOAT!
Usyk has the same birthday 🎂 as Muhammad Ali...17th January.
Derek cool af ..
Lol very feel
I love chisora man
Love him Usyk ❤
Na 😂
That was so dope
Quality
💪🫡😂🤟🙏
Is there any person out there who’s 💩 Derek Chisora isn’t eating! Insufferable annoying journeyman
DDD wanted Chaos and got KO's🧐
Gotta love Usyk 💪🏻❤️
Ukraine Power
😂
Usyk just gets the job done...Fury mouths off and then ducks fights...when he finally met Usyk he was taught a lesson
Usyk. You legend. Seeing this guy fight is an actual blessing. What a fight mate. What a fight
Loool😂
😂😂😂
Lol 😢
😂😂😂😂
❤
Brilliant 😂👌
Usyk can destroy in the ring everybody ❤
😂
Since these two first fought they’ve become good friends. Chisora gave Usyk a good fight, he lost but then brought burgers to eat. Top guy!
Us English get  behind him because he's a true gentleman and a the best boxer ever what a man.special one of a kind.
No English man is  gonna beat usyk in the ring sorry but he’s too good and I’m and English man saying this congratulations to him
Big respect to both champs! Derek gave Usyk one of his toughest fights. But Usyk’s a superstar 💪🏼 God bless fellas from Australia 🇦🇺
I like Usyk but study his eye movements in since f marion jones and the top cyclist then watch icarus documentary and be honest :)orever his eyes stare and don't sit tight at top bottom but the gap stares all is 100 p e ds as the y all are .
😂❤😂❤
I mean it is funny that none of these tough black guys can beat a little WHITE cruiser weight guy!  Gonna need the shotty blud braap braap! 😂
You have got to be a very likeable guy to win a brute like Derek on your side
Derek fought well against Usyk in his fight.
His top 10 to ever do it fact
Too funny
Усик ты мощный тип
😂😂😂😂
Brilliant 😅
He must be tired all these easy fights against AJ , FURY, BELLEW, &DD
Usyk the best boxing and attitude and everything for me ❤
Brilliant fight Alexander i new you would do it. Your a true LEGENED.  SLAVA UKRAINI
The guy should retire,he has nothing left to prove.
Brilliant 😂
Two clowns.
He's too good ❤
Absolutely Classic 😝
Love this 🤣🤣🤣
You can see the fans love Usyk. The roar of the crowd when he entered the ring was epic. He really has become a fan favourite.
Love it 🤣🤣🤣👏👏👏
Love it
Great how Derek is whom Usyk most respects for his warrior spirit of us Brits
Belts off to Usyk.
😂
love it Derek. hahaha  Very classy. Just wonderful mate.
Class😂😂😂
lol
The most humble boxer in history.. Mr Usyk.what a boxer
Top man ❤
😂😂
😂😂😂😂
DC looking like Dubois dad 😅
What a nice guy an real role model 👏 👌 🙌
Love this guy. Slava Ukraini 💙🇺🇦💛
Love this moment 😂😂😂😂
Class !
Good sportsmanship
Love it lol.
Rzadko sie zdarza w boksie inteligentny , klasa gosc a. Uslyk taki jest .
Usyk congrats  always believed your yourself and your team like you always do. age d sent matter you are a very strong young man god bless you always stay blessed and humble 👌🤜🤛🎉🎉🎉🎉👏👏👏
FACTS! 💯% Lets GO PARKER!👊👊👊
Easy money for Usyk
😂
So good! These two seem to get along so good. Man respect!
Wow he can even put a smile Derek's face, I had no idea he could smile 😮
Lol
Love this!
Hahahahahhahaaa
Here we go all about money people need to stop watching
I want to see chisora usyk, he gave him his hardest fight
Nah! 🤣😂
Stranded of boxing is dire ,the heavyweight division is straggling to come up with an actual real fighter. Alai its all fixed
He may possibly be the most universally liked man since Robin Williams. You just instantly smile when you see him😊 CONGRATS CHAMP 🥊🏆💪💥💕 USYK USYK USYK
Usyk will ko Parker next
Very few foreign boxers are loved in England. And rightly so
Meanwhile.....fury is posting videos,still claiming he beat him twice,and is the only man about that can beat him,man just needs to stay retired,its getting boring. Anyway,congrats champ,speaks volumes when the whole of Wembley is chanting for the opposition.
Chisora sucks
Усик - Сила Природи 💖🌞💙💛🇺🇦🌾🌻🌈 !!!
I imagine that Usyk has a ringtone on his phone for whenever Chisora calls him, it’s goes ‘DEREEEK’
I am starting to think the fights are rigged Daniel left his chin out to dry the entire fight.
Усик молодец...🌟🌟🌟
DC is a real one!
😂😂😂😂😂 brilliant
DERECKKK
He's doing us a favour by humbling Dubois and his camp. They got way too cocky before this fight.
This just proves it. The best modern heavyweight. No one is even close to his level right now
😂😂😂
Lol usyk is such a good dude
Nice gen of fighters so chilled....unlike ali, tyson etc etc
Happy that Usyk understood😂😂 m a big fan....🙏
This is lovely 😂
AJ won't be happy with your disloyality
Nice guy... and won me 400 quid last night.. thank you very much 😊
Nah 🤣 there is only one left now. Joseph Parker great boxer and great man as well but he will lose too
Azov Neo Nazi
😂😂😂😂
Mainly the Blacks there not use to getting Humiliated
Usyk well done ....talk sport is now called talkadverts ...too many adverts😵‍💫🤯
That’s the thing our expectations and who we see as best fighter in Europe is only what we see but in other countries there fighters who are just hidden n are in a different level like we see aj n fury as the best but then uysk just beats them up with ease like some Japanese sensai😂
Fresh as a daisey and he's been in with Daniel dynamite dubois 😂😂😂😂 We have no1 left to stop him he's to good
He's earned my respect
So humble
most cheerful clip I've seen in a long while 😄
Usyk has the biggest heart what a man
😂😂😂
Both top guys usyk is another level 🫡
usyk really beat the brakes off the British top level heavy weights
Chisora put himself between the top Brit boxers , 😂😂😂😂
Poor fight I want to see Usyk in a proper fight I could do better and I’m old.
Brilliant 😂😂
What a question? Tyson wants to try third time
I don’t even follow boxing, but Usyk is one cool dude man every time I see a clip of him it’s either funny af or he’s just being humble af you gotta respect it
That's  LEGENDARY..😂😂😂❤
Potaraco cijelu britansku ufuranu kremu u boksu više puta
Usyk Usyk Usyk 🇬🇧🇺🇦🇬🇧🇺🇦
😂😂😂😂 class
😂😂😂legend
Nice blokes!!
😂😂 brilliant
Lmao
The people's champion 🏆 🥇 🏅 🙌🏼
Derreeekkk
Straight to the point nahh
😅💪💪
All the disrespect other fighters show him and he never takes it personally
Hahaha
Nah! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
😂
Out of all chisora was the closest to beating him
Please tell me he not gunna fight chisora.
For a sec i thought he was jon jones
😂😂❤
Usyk kills it 😂😂😂😂❤
Derrrrrrekkkk i coming for youuu
Levels to this game ❤
As an English man, I can not help but love Usyk. He destroyed our best, and I was here for it. I hope he has Fury for a 3rd time and put him into retirement properly.
Just like two school kids having a laugh.
No. That was funny AF 😂
Maybe daniel will go back to school now and realise he got lucky with joshua and usyk dismantled him. 💙💛
I knew Derek In 2006 - 2007- 2008 year,  and I can tell  you he is very nice guy.  It is just on media and before fight show off...
Derek. You are probs only one he didn't really beat up haha
😂😂😂😂
Most English ‘Na’ ever 😂😂
Brilliant 😂
Goat ❤
Lol 😂😂😂😂😂
I love Usyk. What a fantastic boxer 💯🥊
😂😂😂😂😂
Delboy🤩 Not the best but tough as nails.
(Im feel)is a beast!!! Watching him fight is never boring!!! 💪🫡😤💯
5guys..?
Man of the people.
😂❤
He is a mad man 😂
It a mark on the guy. Hopefully he won’t wait so to to get in the ring again
😂😂😂😂👍👍👍🫵🙏👍👍👍❤️
Usyk is the Godfather of today's British heavyweight boxers😂😂 beat them individuals twice💀
Usykabone
Usyk is such a cool guy
People overstate Delboys performance against Uysk. It was his first heavyweight outing and Derek just rough housed for a few rounds.
Brilliant 🎉
❤❤❤
😂😂😂😂😂
Two great friends togeather ....
No😂😂😂😂😂😂love him for this😂😂😂
😂😂😂
Usyk is a freak
Chisora is Usyk's Five Guys dealer 😁
very....feel
Usyk = Ukraina!! He is brave, and great fighter who never gives up
Despite beating everyone  No one hates Usyks
Fury fury fury! Tyson won the second fight 👏 🙌
Usyk is ALIEN!!He s one of the best ever in the history!Slava ucraini!
NO AMERICAN HW TO CHALLENGE HIM. ALL THE BRITS HAVE BEEN BEATEN. PARKER NEXT.
Never see before delboy smile like that😂
USYK GOAT🍀
😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
😂😂😂
Nah, cuz don’t push the horses
Usyk is the real deal and a peoples champions,  chisora is slso a lovely person always gracious in defeat  and respectable
No.😂😂😂
Derrick were  the 5 guys
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
You won't have an easy win like that against Joseph Parker.
😂😂😂😂
on behalf of  Brits please Del Boy ask him to retire 😂😂
Absolutely love this 😂
Not even a starch
😂
He never beat Fury. gaslighting doesn't work on me.
Proved last night I did have doubts....... not anymore guys up there....... who's left to fight him?
Derrick wants da fight.
Goats 🐐 ❤
Usyk is the most proudest, genuine, likeable, honest, intelligent & best boxer the 🌍 has seen, in recent times, & imo the greatest to ever do it…comes from cruiser weight & wipes the floor with every heavyweight he’s faced, most of them twice over…real boxing fans appreciate special fighting talents like this…and as a Brit, I was cheering him to victory instead of DDD 🤷‍♂️
Fair play mate
He funny usyk 😅😂
Вот это круто
Brilliant 😂😂
Sasha you are something else.❤❤❤❤❤
Congrats Usyk! Been following you for years! Unit!
This Champion walks with GOD just like ALI in his days here on earth . Why do I say that . Well just look around at the love they create  in people for them . And GOD feels that energy and so GODs in there corner . So only a fool would dare mess with that force . Nice win CHAMP the force is with you . From a Londoner U.K .
Styles make fights. It’s weird that Chisora got beat up three times by Fury, but almost beat the guy who beat Fury twice.
Quality😂usyk is just immense
1:4
Gggggg
😂😂😂
He is a tough man with a lot of respect
💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Loved the Nah 😂
How on earth can you not like Usyk, what a man, what a champion.  🙏🙏🙏👌👌👌
That's so cool
😂😂
Legend
Usyk is incredible
Chisora just trying to brown nose to get a pity fight. Embarrassing tomato can.
як не чеши все одно козаки красиві
Derek said " you need to be mentally disturbed to beat Usyk"
😂😂😂😂... love this guy
Uysk it is what it is champ 😂
😂😂😂😂😂
A Proper champion!!!, and great to see there friendship
😂😂😂
The people's Champ. Usyk,  the clown of the party the funnish guy in the room at the same time the badest M.F on the planet 😂😂😂😂😂
He never beat Tyson fury up?
This is awesome. Wholesome AF
Usyk Robinson
Joe Parker going to beat him don't worry Chisora 😅
Король дружелюбный 😂❤❤❤
😂😂
Guy destroyed British heavyweight elite. Twice 💪🏆
😂😂😂😂
He’s made monkeys out of all of them .Chisora gave him his hardest fight .
I love this. Everyone we throw at him he just keeps taking them down. He’s not even a proper heavyweight. Giant killer.  He’s the best. On top of that he’s a really nice guy too.
Usyks class
Funny Derek yeah. Stop beating us up.
Brilliant!!!
I love big Del
Hes too good
😂😂
😂😂😂😂
A night out with Derek and Usyk would be a proper quality
he beat all British boxers
Usyk is an absolute class act great fighter with a brilliant sense of humor. This is how a world champion behaves setting an example for all his fans and the kids that look up to him.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂
Usyk is a MF'K, G 🔥🔥💯
Gotta love both them lads...quality.
I don't like him, and neither does anyone else.  He cares more about him than promotes peace in his country. I never hear in his interviews talking about the bad things happening in his home country. Everyone is saying the Ukrainian soldiers, warriors the family man. He cares about his money and the attention everyone is giving to him.  I have no respect for him, he left his country and people behind so he can enjoy the lavish life in the UK.  No worries, money will vanish soon and fame.
Move over Derek.....not good enough mate 😢😢😢
lol I also begging on their behalf
Brit basher
Family ❤times 🔥
Na! 😂😂😂😂😂
Derek Chisora used to be low-IQ like the  Benn's, AJ, Dubois and his coach, and the others. He's gotten better over the years because he spends less time with other black people.
Its amazing that Usyk doesn't have any mark  what so ever on his face. It means Dubois posed a zero threat.
The guys is an all round top diamond
Olek is just the greatest… !
I've been following Usyk when he was in cruiser weigh..... I knew he'd excel in heavy weight. God please keep him strong....
чёрт, ты зачем базарил и вёл себя так? если нейтрален исчез бы сразу, а ты как девка на камеру рисовался. Ты же понимаешь что этого никто не забудет ? скоро эта американская тема с войной между украиной и россией прекратится же. ты теперь без флага и без Родины.
Both great guys. Love Chisora too
Mostly boxer are mates. They are a big family ❤
😅😅😅😊simply the BEST. 🤙🦊🇬🇧
Derek does not duck anyone, and even the fights he lost, the opponent knew they were in a fight.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Usyk is to boxing what Federer is to tennis.
Not a mark on him!
Hes a legend😂😂
I like this
Love em both
Derek is a maniac 😂😂😂😂😂
1947? Year in Ukraine
Was Usyk really in a fight?? See how fresh he looks. 🤣🤣🤣
Legend ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I just love Usyk😂😂😂😂
Legendary
Stop push horses
Love the man...such a wonderful human being 😊
Del boy in his element
Dude just loves beating tf outta us brits 😂 Couldn't ask for a better man to do it though
😂😂😂 im sure, Usyk is real friend!
😂😂😂 im sure, Usyk is real friend!
😂😂😂 im sure, Usyk is real friend!
USYK USYK USYK USYK 🇺🇦
Very feel
Historic and priceless
This is just beautiful ❤
Die Ukraine wird Moskowien besiegen – genauso wie der ukrainische Kosake Usyk gesiegt und unangefochten Weltmeister geworden ist!
He's literally the goat of this generation, no questions asked
😂
Brilliant
The only person he's never thought is Joseph Parker.
Derek is machine too
Hahahahaha 😂
😂😂😂
quality
"I'm fil I'm very fil" 😂😂
Дай Боже здоров'я ВАМ.
I love this. Fan of both warriors. Pure class ! Usyk is the best of the best ! A phenomenon.
How to beat a Pom 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Nice one
Legends
Love Del Boy and Usyk. Top guys
Chisora gave Usyk what he needed to handle heavy hitters 🎉🎉🎉
No 😂
Chizora is a sweet soul
Love it lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Absolute gold!... brilliant clip, can't stop watching it and laughing 😂😂😂
still think to this day no brit yet to put up a better fight than derek against usyk   man got genuine reason for genuine smiles on every usyk win
😂😂😂😂🥊🥊🥊
Chisora is a fake guy!😂
Love this des pleading with usyk not to twat them all the time and he’s like nahh I like 👍🏻 😂 lol
We'll need to support russia at this point
He answered so fast
😂
🤣
Fit young healthy Ukrainian  y isn't he fighting for his country  in this terrible war.

😂😂
Can't stand Chisora he needs to Chill and give Parker his praise
Funny monster
"Crackup!!!
Hilarious
Champion
Let the man move into Buckingham palace. Usyk is the real king of England
Usyk is a fuking machine dominated cruiserweight and now heavyweight division he is just next level 🎉
Love this so much! 😅
At this point he’s just taking the piss & I love it!
😅😅😅😅😅😅
Usyk! Usyk! Usyk! Greatest Champion to lace them up! Class, charisma, respect and a fantastic sense of humor! ❤
These two ❤😂
He said too beat Usyk you have to be mentally insane.
😂😂😂😂
Derek is sooo annoying
This is my favourite video ever I swear ❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂
Derek is 1 of my favorite heavy weights....a dog in the ring.
7-0 against British fighters at heavyweight
Usyk is quite handsome.  Definitely more so than Luke Partridge 😂 (Tyson Fury)
That’s funny
Class moment in time can you do us a favour stop beating us up 😮Mr USYK NO 😂🤣😅just one of the lad's Mr USYK down to earth Derick such a good lad this is the part of boxing I like 🥊rivals who are best of friends both classy respect gentlemen 🙏🤝🫶👏👏
😂😂
Not a mark on his face. Lol.
class act
Friendship made from true understanding
Apart from Fury, British boxing is full of pansies for the $ rather than a legacy.
😂
❤❤❤❤❤
❤🎉
No 😂😂😂😂
💩🏠 chisora
lol
This is one of my favourite clip's ever 🥊
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤ absolute quality 👌
Absolute top man.
Oleksandr the Great
Usyk is such a nice man, I still think he went easy on AJ and Chisora, he likes them and didn't want to knock them out. He came to make a statement vs Dubois tonight after the controversy of their first fight and the trash talk.
Chisora is the one who really troubled Usyk for their 1st 6 rounds. Then usyk came back. Was like a draw
Chisora, the vet, knows appealing to mercy is the only way.
Yes 😂😅
Derricks energy is completely different. He’s a real
Usyk is the highest level of alpha male without talking like he's a tough guy. This is a true apex predator. Highly intellect, knows how to dismantle his prey and devour.
Usyk top lad humble and honest got good values there will be a u.k heavy weight out there ...... always is
Chisora is a character 😅
It's the white man beating up the..
Now u no black boy 😂❤🎉😢😮😮😅😅😊
No😂😂😂
Good dudes !
Absolute class 😂
Legendary
how could you not like this guy . . .  awesome
Delboy gave him an alright fight
That Na sounded proper English
You just gotta love this guy! Well done Champ, you are absolute Legend in 10,20 yrs time people will be talking about you wondering how you had managed to achieve absolutely everything in boxing. Hats off!
It seems derek was still uysks toughest fight.
Boxing is a tough and ugly sport.  So it’s possibly one of the most refreshing things in life to see two former opponents getting along so well like Usyk and Chisora.  Life is so cool.
Chisora during the interviews and broadcast work has said that he is basically team Britain but I think that he on the inside always wants Usyk to keep winning. This would have been a good moment to bring forth the burgers in the locker room after the fight🎉🎉🎉
Nice probs to Derek ❤
No five guys del?
The best ever. Usyk then Ali
😂
Don't pussssh the horsesssss!!!
2 top guy's 😅
That's a nice moment,Derek's a tough guy nice to see his funny side and Usyk is always class.
Dereck!!!!!How are you?? 👀
They are best friends,
What a cool relationship
Delboy gave my nephew the middle finger on the way back to the changing room in Wembley tonight n blanked him in trafalgar square last year pure clash he is
Derick and Usyk reminds me of Cormier and Khabib
The GOAT of Boxing USYK!! 💪🏻👊🏻🐐💯🔥
Love them both x
Great guy usyk
I wanted dubois to win obviously 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 but I love usyck he's a top man and top fighter.
Alexander the Great 😆 he loves Derick
Brothers from other mothers
Impossible not to like Usyk
😂😂
