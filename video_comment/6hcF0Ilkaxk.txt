14:23 Toyota estima mention in Malaysia 🗣️🗣️🗣️
"In California, you're allowed to live in the parking lot at Whole Foods" 😂
oh ALLLL the German flags are Belgium flags in the video x3 its ok tho xd <3
wrong flag on the LUP GTI thats a Belgium flag, not a German one but its all good tho keep it up guys love the show! no biggie  jusssst saying : 3 ><
Dude, you nailed it.
Took me a year to come around to the new channel, I really started to dislike donut at the end but god damn this is quality content 😎 glad to be back on the train broski
Bro.. because you like Volkswagen group cars , check (Skoda Octavia vrs and seat Leon cupra)
My dude, Caldina GT-Four?!?…..all wheel drive turbo 3sgte. Basically a Grocery Getter brother to the Celica GT-Four.
HELL YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHH CLIO V666!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Love the trip down memory lane with the final episode of really cool cars before the world got bland
Crazy German flags
german flag from belgium
In Australia and currently own a vx clubsport but it’s damaged can say tho ,very fun cool car
I've wanted a clio since forza motersport.
How was the Zonda not covered under Show and Display? Surely someone lined the pockets of the people that come up with that list enough to have it put on it right?!
Haven't watched this video  i could be wrong but this number 4 a ford falcon or holden commodore
The Holden is a GTO
Hey James, another great video! Just wanted to say the ending of this video really resonated with me. The final message that the lines are blurring between brands and thus they are losing a sense of identity and general quality. It is the sad reality of the world and is a tasteless movement - purely for financial gain. My point is, I see this message (as sad as it is), as a reason to stay authentic. So I guess I just want anyone reading this to know that there is an absolute importance in authenticity and being true to yourself and your brand. Thank you!
I have such a soft spot for that S3.
To this very day, the B5 S4 in Imola yellow is my dream car.
Love compareing Australia as the other America or our cousins.  🇺🇸 🇦🇺
The real face of fallen donuts back fellas. Speeed is the new home for us.
08:00 WASN DAT FÜR'N KOMBI?!?!
Ah, yes. Wolfsburg, Belgium.
Just saw this video, and I gotta give you props for the Clarks Wallabees 👏🏼
Love you too bro, big ups
I grew up in Europe and remember the early 2000s when Ecuador was blasting from every car guy's Ibiza Cupra, Golf GTI, S3, and Corrado. However, my ultimate "level 5 need it now" car is the SEAT Córdoba Cupra 1.8T 20V. It will challenge any Integra Type-R, and it's a much meaner looking VW Bora with only 2 doors.
5:36  if Mitsubishi did that with their mirage it would still be on the market today😂😂😂😂 60hp vs 123 hp huge difference!! The mirage might be bigger than the mirage but what if someone put an Evo engine in a mirage ??
Idk why but the 4:12 pimp  Had me dying
14:45 G8/GTO
Estima??
You should dive deeper into that chassis sharing in the early 2000's
Tuscan would have been an 8 for me
...because fiberglass"
Had a bootlegged VHS of CKY, when I was a kid. Hid that sucker in the bottom of my desk in my bedroom. Thanks for the reminder!
Please pay a little bit more attention to getting things right in the videos. Wrong flag for the German cars, the topsecret Supra did NOT come with the 3S-GE, not even the TOMS castrol Supra did, that had a modified 3S-GTE. The topsecret Supra had the v12 from the century.
Hey dude.   Thnx for great content!  Here’s an ide pitch;  Could you do one of these…but kind of in reverse?  The thing is…we got sort of the same 25 year rule here in europe…at least when it comes to free import without taxes…  And there is a lot of US brands and models that arent sold over here…  What cool US cars from 2000(and older) would you recomend for import to europe?  Thnx, dude.
i've always wanted an s3
Lupo and Clio V6 in a YouTube video!?! I have found my people and my home.
I love how James loves TVR trevcar lmao
1JZ and RS4 Avant = ❤
You got the German flag wrong.
Imagine rolling out your uni in Toyota original with superchargered engine people be bananas double times for luxurious interior and freakin speed sound of exost
Where'd you get the Polo please?
19:56 Came back to this video half a year later… I must've been half tuned out (likely: making dinner) the first time I watched it, because screw that red gull-winged plea for attention in the back, Horatio Pagani has *taste* in bicycles! That thing rules! It's… maybe a Renault frame originally? But not original are the flat bars on the angled-down front tube (with a modern-style headlight mounted in the center), the integrated pump on the seat tube, the over-sized bottle cage, and I'll bet that's an uprated crank set. I'll even forgive the fenders: he's obviously commuting on this thing.
18:00 Dude, tell me that isn't Robert Plant?
I had a s4 sedan and a avant I lobe the b5 so much😊
Nissan stagia and subaru legacy tt wagon are my 2 dream builds
Hearing cky mentioned in a car video is crazy
The Renault Clio v6 has always been a dream man
haha dude, 🇧🇪 is not the German flag it's the belgish one. the German flag is: 🇵🇬
Love it
TVR was my favourite car on GT3 when I was a little kid
Ah yes the most affordable car of all the pagani zonda
In my country it’s 89,000 USD… WHATTTT
i feel very proud to see a HSV clubby getting recent recognition, it was the legit the first car i’ve ever been in (my mumma is a hoon❤)
Correction, Altezza Gita never came with the 3sge. It was either the 1gfe or 2jzge
7:49 you used the belgian flag instead of the german one and had me questioning if audi is actually a belgian company
No we have the Jetta and bora
You have have me wanting a project car now!
gg
The outro 💔
Lova ya too bro ❤
What do you think about the Australian Ford Falcon GT-P
Jeremy, I thought the Opel Speeedster/ Vauxhall 220 was also the Saturn Sky/ Pontiac Solstice for America. Saturn also had a "Red Line" edition that was turbo charged.
I love you man. I feel the same way about my things. My old car is a '97 Saturn SC1 with a stainless header, aftermarket ebay intake, MTX Audio woofers and coilovers made for a 2008 WRX🤓😎 I wear pro club basketball shorts and DVS or Osiris skateshoes almost everywhere. They fit great and look good. My sensible car is a 2016 ford focus st 😆
Slot a 5 cylinder in the S3 and you're golden. Granted it's more work than is fun but it's also gonna be worth it - be like AWD on the Golf.. hmm.. which may be the better option - fit a Haldex system to the Golf then!? lol
Fun fact: The Audi RS4 at 7:30 was a pretty normal car here in Europe, because everybody had the Audi A4 Avant which looked almost identical, cost only around 4000 bucks ( ten years ago) and was easily modified to look like a sleeper RS4. The motor was not the fastest, but one of the strongest and reliable Audi ever made: the 1.8 turbo. I had one, next to my 1987 Golf MK1. Good old times
Broooo the Germany flag is literally a belgian flag😢😂
I had a 2000 Audi.. DO NOT BUY ONE... That thing was a nightmare.. ABS didn't work, no ABS light.. Speed reporting was off (reporting 30 KM/H, driving 36 = big fine..), RPM reported 7k+ when in 6th going 80.. you name it, it had a problem.. even the Wipers got problems before I junked it. Absolute garbage. If you replace everything with aftermarket, it MIGHT be ok...
Fun, because in Mexico it does exist the CLio V6.
You rock dude !
Dude please get your flags right… Germany 🇩🇪 is not to be confused with Belgium 🇧🇪 4:49
Dude you confused the german flag with the belgian
Go the Ute mate, there’s a whole culture around the Ute. Try the annual Ute Muster round Deni
Dude, it’s Renault 5Turbo. One sick car
Are you wearing that Cricket shirt?!?
Re: that final thought... I heard an old man say "cars nowadays are like Jelly Beans, they're all the same, the only thing that changes is color" 😢
How much was the TVR???
Soon it well be the dacia sandero
❤ great video my man……live your content
Jetta is not same as Bora. Jetta is in the middle between Bora and Pasat. That is why Bora was discontinued.  Bora was like a sedan golf mk3/mk4.  Later that space took jetta and golf mk 5/mk6 wagon and jetta wagon is same car. Only difference is in tail lights and couple centimetres.  Also that flag is Belgian,German flag is other way around 😂
2:20 FREE LUIGI
"That's what I love about these imports man, I keep getting older, and they stay the saaaame age. Heh heh heh heh...."
saw a r34 skyline gt for $15k here in htx
That little clio looks friggin perfect. Wtf
Why German flag is replaced by Belgium ones?
Not talked about much in the importing scene - I want a Holden from Australia. Couple more years and youll see me in a commodore ute :)
There is only one rs4 b5 for sale that I could personally find for 45k€ and the funniest thing about it is its number plate, RÄS-4, just how you would pronounce it. And it looks so clean, inside and out.
In Florida you can buy a stock r34 gtr for 35k.
Damn bro, we have cars in Belgium? Didn’t know that bro. I thought that was Germany but I guess not!   (That’s not serious for anyone who can’t comprehend that, it’s not serious. It’s a mistake they made. 🇧🇪 is Belgium, they meant to use 🇩🇪 for Germany)
"it's the coolest thing that the French have done since they cut the heads off of rich people"?   Dude really? This is why big time is going steady and you're not.
Love you too James; keep putting out great content
m first car was a 2003 audi avant and i gotta admit it was a pos BUT it was MY pos and i loved that car till the day it stopped kicking
Need a story time about the heart attack
Australia is England's Texas
The s3 has a head with bigger valves so parts are going to be a pain in the a**!
I love the mini-game of guessing the car based on its silhouette before he reveals it
you need the bad and the good too find the greatness in things. I'm going to miss the old days when risk was a necessity to defined the greatness, meanwhile today nothing is great just lame or mid at best.
Also a 90's kid, and besides Gran Turismo, some of these cars like the Audi RS4 Avant, brought up some old forgotten memories i had growing up.
This is why don't lost ALL is best creators AMC were left with crap😊
None of this is realistic at all. I shipped a Toyota alteza it took me 36 months to get that car over the border. I went to Mexico to pick it up finally and drove it still on its old oil to Texas changed the oil and continued on to ny and didn't get stopped I had nooo plates now 3 years later I will have a black on black alternative with a 6 spd and can't register it still
Thank you for all the love you put into this! We love you too! We're all happy that you did so well post 🍩. You are one of the reasons why we were fans of that channel!   Do you recommend any company that does pre purchase inspections? I'm willing to travel anywhere in the US for the car I want, but I want some peace of mind before buying
Another 90s kid who grew up on GT I see.
Opal speedster representing Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2 ✌🏼
Love the fact you have your own channel and own Direction Loved this Video!
WHERE WOULD VW BE WITHOUT AUDI?
Belgium isn’t real use whatever flag you want James
+25% Tarriff
22:09 the “very much” got me teary eyed lol thanks man. much love, always.
14:58 “if you’re into vans….” One of the weirdest things I’ve ever heard lol there are a few specific ones that are cool, but I saw mostly mom van shapes and that’s grody.
2:18 ahhhh THE GOOD OLD DAYS!
Every new version of range topping luxury car test now: "This latest version is 20% heavier, has two less cylinders, makes less power from the engine. But thanks to some very clever hybrid technology goes faster" cue scene on test circuit of car tearing it up around corners. BS continues "and boy does this thing go go go! Wow! And those very smart engineers have added this button... once you press this button, your all wheel drive car turns into a drift car!" cue the test driver grinning fiercely and some truly cringe whooping. hahahaha!
I'm sorry. You can be sure that anyone who pulls up in TVR Tuscan absolutely phuks HARD.
The Zonda was never legal here, but they’ve always been here because they’re all Show Or Display eligible and the owners don’t drive them all that much anyways. Show Or Display cars are allowed to drive 2,500 miles per year, nobody’s driving more than that in a Zonda.
The way I’ve always thought of the TVR Tuscan: it’s kinda like a first gen Viper if the first gen Viper was more bubble-shaped.
Toyota Origin is for Japanese CEO’s, specifically, and nobody there who isn’t one would even think of being driven in one.
Up to Speed on G Power
Opel Speeedster From NFS Hot Pursuit 2 🤙🏼
I see those schmidt modern lines back there, hell yea.
No Nissan Figaro? Haha I love it
"Argentinian"  uh huh sure
James I fw this polo long sleeve so heavy
We love you too, bud.
The Car Guy 🎉🎉 is back👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 💯💯💯
Good luck finding a lupo gti anywhere
In about 2012 ish I saw a silver clio v6 for sale near Macclesfield, UK for £11000. I pulled my leon cupra R over and had to take a look, I remember being in awe of it and looking through the windows and just being like.. that's so cool.. so special.. it's the only one ive ever seen in my life.. but 11k seemed so expensive! What a good deal it arguably was..
Chevy cobalt ss engine was a disaster...  And the car from Australia you want is the Holden Ford Falcon with the Barra engine, not the one he shows
The 25 year rule is dumb
Only reason I watched Doug Nut was for your videos. Speeed Rules!! Keep em coming and I’ll keep supporting. Just relatable, like a dude you’d have a beer with and start talking about cars then look at your watch and be like wow 2 days passed. Also fellow GTI owner so hell yeah lol.
James never stop making videos your the Anthony Bourdain of car culture your passion, dialogue and insight
Stay safe man!!hope you're well,  keep your head up. Keep kicking and screaming. I'm rooting for you
I've always loved the Pagani back story. It's really sweet
I recently broke up with my 4 yr gf. I thought we were going to be in it for the long run but, it's just my dog and I mow. Cars have always been my passion and i am ready to quit driving a boring car and get something to go road tripping with my dog.
im from europe so my question is who in his right mind wants to import that shitboxes (speaking of the audis , volkswagens and the clio).  the yellow s3 made me laugh cuz the license plate is from the town next to me xD also typical vw gti or s3 driver in there , pedophile starter kit : golf gti/s3,  chinstrap, polarized glasses and that cap. top kek
I’ve been waiting for this series update in the previous channel and now it’s here!!
I love that your bring vw/ Audi into your videos
Seriously rs4 b5 was illegal in US? lol
Tvr got some wild cars 🚗 I’ve seen a few of them before in person they have some of the most unique colors that you’ll ever see factory always thought they were pretty special
Rv6 is js underrated my dream car alomg with pajero evo
I hate SUVs and Trucks of today. This is an amazing video of the sad failures in American car culture. I WANT THAT CLIO!
There's a guy in Roseville California that has a Pagani, is the owner of a tattoo shop his name is wild Bill
These are some cool cars, I would add the Toyota century. Or puegot 505 turbo
we need tiny cars man  make lifted death trucks illegal  i love classic pickups they slap but the modern sh!t is vile
suv's are the worst shit to happen to the world
the cleo. i've loved that damn thing for decades.
This dude got paid a million dollars per episode at Donut and he acts like he ain't got cash for the Pagani
17:01 that GTO ran into a sunfire. Just like.. barely bumped it.
13:21 AKA A SAAB AND A BENZ MADE SWEET LOVE AND NATURALLY BIRTHED THIS LOVECHILD WAGON. FUCK I WANT ONE
it was the RB in top secret supra
did you use belgium´s flag insted of germany´s for a reason ?
This was such an incredibly well made video.
I hope the evo 6 tommi makinen is on the list, funny to see how much their prices will rise even more!
So. Many. Ads. I understand the need to monetise etc but made the video difficult to watch when they’re every 2/3 minutes. Sort it out.
I can’t help but hope that, with what’s going on with Nissan and Toyota, that they breathe new life into that old school JDM tuner world. I think them announcing a revival of those types of cars would see way more support than they imagine. A lot of us grew up idealizing those cars, and now we have the money to buy them.
Brooooo.....This is the forth video that i watched in your channel and I'm in love. I think i should divorced
Why don't you just move to Europe?
The W is upside down, look at the logo it’s like a perfect W…
i think you mistook the German flag with the Belgian flag man
I’m rewatching top gear and it’s crazy how cheap some of these cars WERE
Will cars now have 25% import tax since they are mainly metal?
1:35 the 2nd gen clio with some trim levels is a real pocket rocket
Didn’t know about your content before starting this channel, happy to say I’ll be tuning in for as long as you’re creating. As a mid 90s kid appreciated your sentiment at the end, and am using your work as creative direction for my first enthusiast car purchase as an adult. Thank you!
21:19 thats no german flag dude thats belgium i guess. Germany has horizontal stripes in the order of black red yellow
19:13 affordable?😅😂
never knew you were a CKY kid. hell yeah. i also just found out i live 30 minutes from castle bam 😂
Love my altezza
My biggest motivator towards an import is rhd. I was in a motorcycle accident and so far I have very limited range of motion in my right knee that might make getting in a US market car difficult (maybe my truck will still be easy enough to get in and out of? Haven’t been able to try getting in yet). The concern also comes from the compounded fact of me being on the taller side and wondering if Ill be able to get my leg in the door frame in a way that also allows the rest of my body to follow in a controlled way lol. Not making a hasty decision but I am preparing myself for that possibility 🤷‍♂️.
Using the Belgian flag and not the German one is reason to start a war.
Promoting reading is a very cool move. People need to put down their phones a pick up a book. The research that goes into writing a book is insane, so take advantage of someone else’s labor and read. If you want to hold down your end of a conversation you need to know something, so start reading. When I was a hiring manger I always asked “What was the last book you read?” It’s the sign of someone who’s willing to learn and has the discipline to finish a project.
The  Clio v6 was well represented in NFS MW, that's where i discovered it and thought it was a heavily slept on car. Cool to see it make the list.
oh no americans are lumping ibiza cupra and leon cupra together…
him and Doechii have the same stylist? (complimentary)
The estima is basically a fancier previa
Wagons > all. I want that RS4!
I was so looking to see 2000 Toyota Hiace on the van compilation
I'm a UK resident and my dream car is a TVR Tuscan II. Don't you dare put the prices up on them before I can afford one >:(
ITS PRONOUNCED HOW ITS SPELT NOT RENO GOD DAMN BRUH
You can actually get the Lupo GTI with a   1.6
Owner of the dealership I used to work at had 2 Renault Turbo2 s. Every morning I had to take one out of my bay and park it outside. Then back inside before going home. A little shoebox with 12 inch wheels turbo cosworth 4cyl came from factory with full roll cage and racing harness. Was wicked.
I absolutely love the Audi RS4
* CLAP CLAP CLAP *
Personally I think cars being fun and interesting died when everything went to drive by wire throttle. No physical connection to the throttle kinda kills most of the sensation. And that became more popular in the early 00s.
Awesome video. Love you too James.
Love u too bro
Australia definitely not other US mate - maybe some of Canada part of America
The Holden HSV VX Clubsport was actually sold here in the U.S as a two-door coupe under the Pontiac brand as the GTO. You can get it either with a 5.7L LS1 in the 2004 model year, or a 6.0L LS2 in the 2005-2006 model years.
Why ? Do we not already have enough cars ? Where are you going to get parts ? $50.00 shipping for a $6.00 part ? Hilarious, everyone wants something they can't have but don't know why. The grass is always greener on the other side syndrome. Absolutely no one will even care or know what it is or care to know what it is. You have a mental issue if you think you need one of these
Man I need to find that Up To Speed on Pagani how did I miss that?!
If I could I’d grab an altezza wagon. I mean that’s cool AF
Love you James. That monologue at the end made me cry
omg Ive wanted a Renault Clio since the early 00s when it was a dream to drive in Project Gotham Racing 2  Edit: But the TVR is the goat
8:28 greeeasy German horse purz 😂
Been a sub since day 3 🎉 just signed up for the discord book club see u there ❤
the clio v6 is absolutely overpriced, 5 years ago it was 30k now ppl want 50k, they are literrally masturbating ont he car
Interesting outro, really makes you stop and think how every thing is the same, and the brand logo is what makes the cost vary, we have gotten to a point where there is no creativity or originality, just copying what is trending.
11:43  Cars with same platforms   "Family" 1: -Volkswagen Golf mk4 (3 or 5 door hatchback, 5door wagon) (1.8T, VR6 and AWD avaliable) -Volkswagen Bora/Jetta (Golf but 4 door sedan) -Audi A3/S3 8L (3 or 5 door hatchback) (S3 came only in 3 door variant) -Seat Leon mk1 (5 door hatchback) (1.8T or VR6 in cupra) -Seat Toledo mk2 (Leon but 4 door sedan) -Skoda Octavia mk1 (Sedan, Liftback or wagon) (1.8T and AWD in RS version)  "Family" 2: -Audi A4/S4/Rs4 B5 (4door sedan or 5 door wagon) (1.8T and AWD avaliable) (RS only in wagon version) (buy one from 1999 or younger, there are many good changes after facelift) -Volkswagen Passat B5 (4door sedan or 5 door wagon)(very rare with W8 engine)  -Skoda Superb mk1 (forgotten middle child, only cool option is 1.8T)
"Just like my fiance" 😂😂😂 amen brother 🫡
Audi bby
Cool
You da best 😊❤
so your homework for this consisted of.. playing gran turismo 3?
Time to do a Speeed on the Acura TL one of the most underrated cars of all time
Bro, you said you had a heart attack! You need to take care of your health. Cut out sugar, cut out carbs as much as possible or drink some apple cider before consuming them, cut out seed oils and any food fried in them. Introduce animal fats, fish fats, and olive oil in your diet, and take pure cacao, in whatever form you want! All the best bro 🫶
What are those box files above you, the ones that say DO NOT OPEN, and so onm?
That last comment was deep dude. Made me stop renovating and go 'huh!'
Pagani! Yes
B5 RS4 Avant is my dream
I thought all the TVR's got wrapped round lamposts. They were made for people who want to die a spectacular death.
I still want a 97' Alto Works
Why are Lexus F cars never on these lists?
6:29 that's what I thought. It doesn't make sense for it to be his middle name with the W.
"other america" .. but communist and vile.
Where’s the aristo 2jzgte or the hot hatch version with the 3uzfe
You missed a chance to make a Robert Plant comparison with "this guy". Queue "immigrant song".
Zonda is 25 year old wtf
i want the rs4 soooo bad.
need to show some love to the Aussie Barra XR6 4.0 turbo, thing's are pretty much an aussie 2jz
Bagani
CLEO FTW!!
I might be shooting myself in the foot with this one...but I'm waiting one more year before I can finally get at the ultimate commuter. The Audi S2 1.2L TDI.
this is litterally the first time ive commented over disagreeing with someones opinions on a video like this but a clio is a 4.9 and vert s15 is a 3 something....my god youre unhinged
nice rs4 avant, i had a reflex silber b6 1.8t avant with the unltrasport package, they look so sweet.
The Tuscan Speed 6 is absolutely nuts
James' speech at the end hits hard man
Describing a car as being like your fiancé and then rating it a 3/5 is hilarious
im from the uk, i currently own a audi s3 1.8t. its been my third one i love them.
I thought they were legal as well. Used to see Wyclef in his on rt46 in NJ often when they were knew
A reminder for you Americans; You can already import the most mightiest of automobiles, the Renault Twingussy equipped with the mind shattering "easy transmission"
Those Audi s3's are stilll everywhere here in Australia, RHD too, if you Yanks want to find one cheap, look DownUnder
We already got 2010's up in Canada
I completely agree with your closing notes, Them were some good words
yoo the altezza wagon wooo. the is300 sportcross is hard to find hopefully I can grab the altezza in the near future
Old highschool buddy had a 4motion mark 4 back in the day, not right hand deive but still 4 wheel drive
in CA don't these cars all still need to pass smog?
Cool chair
Better import fast! Before the best deal maker Trump puts tariffs on importing old cars lol
Thanks now i want a Toyota Origin
OK finaly, since the end of literaly every car channel on yt....I still recognise this, and I like it! thank you James!
Cars from 2010 are now good to import to Canada😭
Lord knows I always wanted to f*** the Sylvia from the back! Put a fleshlight in the exhaust and have a friend rev it up for some pushback! Mmmhmm.
What happened to cars for 3k to 7k. For budget people living in the lower end of the spectrum?
I love how non Europeans make this mistake so frequently lmao (Belgian flag instead of German one).  Most memorable was the time when MCM did it with their Cheap Golf street cred build.
🤘 Let’s Gooooo!!!!!!!
11:28 awake late  now , wondering why this dude thinks German cars are quality - cool video though thanks thumbs up
loads of 20v turbo swaped lupos in the uk 300hp min
Rating TVR a 0 is just wrong. I'm excited by the manual Gita though.
Please explain Siamese twin skit😂
LET US HAVE THOSE V6 CLIOS MANNN they so rare even in france :'( i get it tho who wouldnt want that?
i love how you gave the Audi to Belgium instead of Germany. Well, according to the flag in the video. I'm from Belgium and we kind of don't want anything to do with Audi anymore as they just shut down a plant here, but we'll gladly take the credit you gave us for the RS4
I subbed because I don't know jack about cars and I like the way you talk about cars lol, thanks bruv!
Reform the EPA and let’s get rid of these crazy ass import laws.
13:21 Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure the Gita unfortunately did not come with the 3sge and was only available with the 1gfe and 2jz from factory
A Lupo with a f***** Belgian flag?! You dorks!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Statistically there has to be at least a few hundred multi millionaires watching these videos so your bit about the zonda isnt totally insane to add to the video lol
Vauxhall VX220...just saying.  ;)
Donut Mic?
Gti, with aftermarket coil overs and a turbo sounds amazing
What’s a Lupo weight in at? In schnitzel’s?
Australia is kinda like other Canada. As an American, I refuse to claim Australia, and would rather offset the blame of Aussie antics on Canada.
The most practical and reliable on this list is hands down the Altezza Gita. That’s number 5 on my list. But I’m also a manual is300 owner so I’m not biased or anything haha also you nailed that ending. Everything is somberly the same.
He had a heart attack?
Use dont get everything i am in golf r group and thats how i found out use didnt get the golf r estate mk7
2000 seemed so long ago, and then I realized I was 13 at that point..
I still own a B5 S4, and fully built the engine 5 years ago. LOVE my B5, never selling it! 🙌  And the S3 after the B5 is my next one to obtain
Want to know about another cool quirky car you can import now? First gen Nissan cube definitely not fast but has a really unique design compared to the 3rd gen’s that are in the US and has quite a bit of potential for tuning.
🎉🎉🎉🎉
10 years ago in Canada...
This has nothing to do with the video , love the videos BTW / i was just wondering about Cherry the Japanese Car ,, Can you do a video on that ?  Sorry for being demanding or whatever still much love .
I want a 2000 audi s3 1.8t 220 hp awd two door hatch back super cool and I want one from a guy with a 20th gti and a 1990 audi coupe Quattro
We love you James from South Africa
The flag direction suggests Belgium.
Should do an episode on “cool cars to rally race in”
Subaru Impreza P1 would make this list and would be a 6 for me.
There's huayra in FW IN
Canada is 15 years
im afraid of EUA dont raise the prices plz
Hello, I just saw your YouTube video regarding cars eligible to import to America in 2025. I've seen several articles and YouTube videos saying the VW Lupo GTI is now eligible, solely based on the fact that it's 25 years old now. I checked the NHTSA website because I'm interested. The Lupo GTI is sadly not on the list. Any thoughts? I want one !  https://www.nhtsa.gov/document/eligible-vehicles-imported-other-countries-non-canadian
Doesn't even work at Donut anymore and he's still single handedly raising cool used car prices... STOP THESE TYPES OF VIDEOS!!! You're ruining the hobby for the rest of us!
Screw all those cars. You were on track with TVR, wrong model. TVR cerbera v12 twin turbo 1200hp 9 to the wheels 1000kg weight. Scariest car I’ve ever driven. Hyper car meets American muscle. Had top speed of a bugoti with the hp to wheel ratio like a drag car. This car will make think twice.
Why did you use the belgian flag for the VW ? Die sind deutsche Qualitätsware. Edit: did you use the belgian flag for all german cars ?
Klein bike just chilling in the background like you’re rooming w 90’s Seinfeld.
I wish we would have got The RS4 b/c the RS4 fixed all the overheating issues that The S4 always died from.
I’d give up ol lefty for one of those altezza gita manual wagons 😫
17:20 has me fuckin dead I cried laughing
I owned the Audi A4 B5 1.8T and bought myself two Audi A3 8Ls  one 200HP and another forged motor 455HP and man am I glad America finally get to import these beautiful cars. Speeed or Big Time should definitely do a build on these, they not appreciated enough around the world, or at least in South Africa.
James,   I must say this as an Audi owner that likes to go fast... If you want to save money, don't buy an Audi.
Donut did us all a favor, now we have this channel that’s 100% the reason why I even watched any of their videos in the first place, James🏎️🔥
herspurr
Homie that ending had me
gimme the ute!
You should check out skoda, they had some great stuff including the fabia vrs diesel hot hatch, all based on the same VAG platforms
I live in the UK, I've always loved the look of VW Lupos and Seat Arosas, I think the 1.7SDI na diesel is interesting, super economical in such a lightweight car but no power
6:47 track ID anyone?
Funny how Pagani became a thing with almost the exact same way Lamborghini became a thing (cars not farm equipment)
Yo u forgot some hondas in this video such as the Honda Accord Type R
1:23 Or the Drag Racing game on Android.
I had an 6kn2 Seat Ibiza, not Cupra, but better - 1.9TDi. Lemme tell you: ~250hp in a 980kg car is pretty sketchy. When nearing 200 km/h the rear doors visually opened with 3-4cm gap. Oh, it was a glorious machine for annoying people...The exhaust was a straight pipe exiting the left side skirt right in front of the rear wheel. Overboosted 1.9Tdi on a straight pipe with a rev limiter is at par on the douchebag scale with one of your cummins diesel trucks :)  ...When I had that car in my inner circle of friends one had (and still have) an S3, one - a Clio V6 (project...still) and the lazy dipshit who I'm still waiting to manufacture the intake for the 350+ mod (10 years in the making, you lazy bastard) - an Opel Speedster with C20XE engine from Opel Calibra (still has it, that lazy pos).
17:00 absolutely nothing to do with America
And this is why people don't like to buy newer cars
Why are all the German cars with the wrong flags on it ?
Clio ain’t 45k😊
Dude I missed you so much ahah you are too natural for shows ! If u can make me laugh u can make everyone xd . Big support from Germany
We still have yet to get the Audi RS4 Avant in the U.S., still dreaming about it. Hopefully they bring us the B10 RS5 Avant
Has anyone imported a car from Japan?
no ford falcon :(
What's with the Belgian flags for German cars?
Is it just me or does JP have ozempic face?
The engine in the speedster has nothing to do with the LSJ/LNF, it's the old school GM Family 2 Z20LET out of an Opel Astra, cast block, timing belt, multi port injection, while the LNF in the Cobalt SS is all aluminum, timing chain and direct injection.
That audi, thank fuck, finally we can export them. Please buy them all. Sick of all the shit boxes in my estate with exhaust whistles on them. Our country is littered in speed bumps, every 200 feet (uk) and these 30 something wannabe teens drive these pieces of dog whistle crap at speed over the bumps. Enjoy them. The RS4 has more electrical Gremlins than the Focus RS has rust and that is saying something.    I used to laugh at my wife for her Clio. Nope, that RS4- take em all
Yeah? We in Europe never got the 2.5 5 Clyinder NA in VWs... Emission Standards and stuff...
Me: wiping the sweat off my brow after not seeing the car I want to import in this list, now the prices for it won't be going up
HOLY CRAP! If it weren't out of my price range, I would import a Ute. Love El caminos and am sad we aren't getting a revive of that line (that I'm aware of).
Still got the Donut mic lol, I love it!
ah yes, the Lupo GTI ... from the famous belgian Company Volkswagen. :-D
25 year law thingy cool and all but poor
A tip from England. Don't buy opal speedsters and never buy a tvr unless you like rust.
This list is difficult james . Almost nobody fits in the opel speedster . Yet fat guys in antwerp have a lupo club . & most tvr’s have killed their owners by now . & after 25 years sadly most of these cars you need to buy @ junkyards :/
Anyone from back in the Vortex days remember the guy who somehow imported a blue S3 and went nuts at a car show and ran from the cops and got arrested? I forget if it was h2o or waterfest but that's all I ever think about when I see an S3...
I'm more interested in the chair that was being used by James
Bring back the episodes where you would bring someone's actual car in???? JAMESSSSSSSS
"I want a French car" said nobody but the guy who plays Gran Turismo and has zero real life car experience.
I want a B5!
Oh cool ANOTHER video of what cars r legal to import.
Have seen/driven most of these vehicle while being able to go to Greece and Travel in my years. Since most of
James get a better back ground. It'll make the videos more professional bru. Give it a try.
"what if we made the engine bigger and put it in the back"" is the most french thing ever
I am sooo glad this space is going to occupied by you. I really thought Corrola was going to fill this. He has some cool cars, but is THE king of the assholes!!! Don't go down THAT route PLEASE!!!
What an achievement in life. Both my m4 and e30 in a Speed video ❤❤❤ @Speeed
15:50
That Belgium flag
Please do a Chicken tax episode. If you posted one already i don't see it, if you haven't.... welcome to the rabbit hole
Me laughing has a Canadian because we get them 10 years before you guys can import them
I have been daydreaming about the Clio v6 forever and this great news got me on the hunt
i know this guy who says he 2 r34 skyline 😂😂
The bike chase scene is one of the greatest pieces of cinema ever created. Absolutely captivating.
Alpine A110????
Brodie put that shit on
Fucking shirt is tiiiighhhht
Ever since your video at Donut on the b5 s4 it’s been my dream car, I’ve owned and daily driven one for over two years and drove 17 hours round trip to buy it
thats enough horse purses for the year
Reminds me of up to speed!!!
14:19 I'm looking at these 'premium' japanese vans like this is just standard stuff where I'm from 🤣🤣
James, you seemed a little down in the dumps my man. Make sure to keep taking care of yourself. Creator life can feel like going through the motions but the community supports you. Call up some friends, take a fun trip, maybe do a fun collab? (Big Time?) Lots of ways to produce content that also keeps it fresh or changes the scenery. Either way, hope you’re good big dog.
can ypu do an up to speed on the ford excursion
Do we still need to pay the chicken tax on it if it's +25 years old?
Where's the 1999 (2024) vid??
Fun story I got rocket money subscribed free trial used it once and forgot about it for 10 months wasted way more money on rocket money than on unwanted subscriptions lesson learned
Clio v6 is still my main in gt7. Now it's officially legal 5.0!
Another excellent video standing out from the crowd courtesy of James’ philosophical take on the bigger picture 👌
)
One correction. The opal speedster was built in the same factory as the Elise at lotus in England. Was also known as the vauxhall vx220.
That green “Noble” is actually my bosses Rossion Q1.  No joke.
i though the top secret supra was v12 swapped
Seat ibiza II was base on VW polo platform, little mistake but still great video
"it looks like a chevy kind of" boy do i have good news for you lol
I still can't grasp the concept that a jdm car with only about 300hp is worth ferrari money it's the dumbest shit I've ever seen
I told yall back in 2012 buy bitcoin! It was $251 dollars a coin when yall laughed at me for buying "magic internet money". 😂😂 If yall lstened a GTR would cost aboût $700!
No e87 130i? It is literaly the only NA 6cylinder 5door hatch with RWD in automotive history and a banger drivers car
It's funny how generation plays into that sentiment you had at the end. People who are my age or my dad's age feel approximately the same way, what about cars from the 60s, And generally wouldn't think of the peak of automotive design being the late 90s. But it makes sense that we probably always think the apex is was big when we were kids. Which is partly why I wouldn't import most of these cars, because none of them are a third generation Trans Am
PUT THAT ON GARMM
to your final point, it is the results of late stage capitalism
14:56 Alphards are cool
Nah... You're being negative, bro. They're just as incredible. Come on. Keep your head up. You're doing what you love. That matters the most. You'll be an incredible success again. We love you, James.
Good video and nice car-list. I am personally in love with the 69 Charger and the 1970 Challenger. But I might go for a Mercedes 190E soon (cheap, available, robust/reliable and cool imho) and keep a Volvo P1800 as a future dream
I love that there's a boookclub! I'm not a reader but it makes me want to! and James, you had a heart attack?!?!
The Mercedes vito v280 came with a vw vr6 too
To each their own opinions and thoughts, but i wish James wouldn't have polarized with these choices so radically when it comes to all the hatchbacks. Don't get me wrong, they are all very cool rides. Its just that not everyone shares that pov, and it might be more prudent to showcase options that are relatable to the majority of viewers, instead of only choices tailored to a small niche of enthusiasts.
Feels good to have a beginning to end interesting, familiar YouTuber I’m excited to watch again.
bro left Donut just to make Donut type videos
hey @jamespumphrey, have you thought of a "how did we get here" series based on cars that prices have gotten out of control? 🤔
I want you to know you are the inner monologue inside my head
Don’t forget the 1M SEAT Leon Cupra. It’s a masterpiece, it utilizes the Audi TT engine and has the undercarriage from a MKIV Golf R32. It was better than the VW Golf GTI. In Europe the 1M was also available with 4 wheel drive. SEAT Calls it 4
12:30. VAG says hold my beer. Today Europeans can buy a Skoda VRS or a Cupra (offshoot of Seat) Formentor. Admittedly they are all Golf Rs in different disguises.  p.s. Fancy a Golf R wagon. Half the Golf Rs sold in the U.K. are wagons.
i waited weeks for a car vid and you post this shit
Belgians do the best cars! 👍 😂
Clicked on this video hoping one would be the stripped down hilux toyota doesnt sell in America.  As far as I am concerned, all of toyota is basically lexus.
Yeah
Well, guess I need a toyota origin....That thing is a real insane statement car, that I would daily.
No Honda love
The v and TV R is for Wilkinson, because Germans pronounce their w's with V's Technically b m w is b m v when Discuss amongst Germans.
Zonda is dope, the backstory was great thank you; perhaps it could’ve already been imported via that show car loophole? :)
nice Klein!
wait till the holden vz is legal, there’s a four door ute known as the crewman came with a v8 tho
its pagani not bagani
I got my first Carhartt jacket because of your video on them. Keep up the good work my dude. Love!
Got recommended this video while watching a Bendaga auction car short 😌 W car community
Why did you use the Belgican flag on German cars? Lol
NEWS!! Im selling a TRD sports lid for Toyota Previa/Estima!!!
I think a cool Topic to make a video about is Avirex and their leather jackets.
You missunderstood the Seat brand CUPRA (CUP RAcing sport version) tha was a Seat model LEON (tuned audi A3 5door) with the smaller Ibiza that was a tuned Polo, the LEON CUPRA was a very apreciated car in Europe and it cames with the 1.8T at 225bhp or the "rare" CUPRA4 that was actually... 4x4 and got an atmoferic 2.8VR6 engine. The LEON cupra appears on the videogame Project Gotham Racing2 if you want to know more of the car before making the videos.
We love you so much. A million plus people came to your channel.
“ Australia’s fun because it’s like, other America. So It’s kinda like going to your cousins house and playing with their toys” 😂 Please put that on a shirt! “Australias like “other America” kinda like going to your cousins house and playing with their toys”  (Place Holden picture here) 🤘😅
The Clio V6 and TVR's are widow makers, and I want one 😂 also the VX220 is on my want list
I challenge your RS4 Avant with an RS6 Avant
Totally left out Fiat Coupe 2.0 turbo r5 dude🤷🏼‍♂️
The PRL cable knit sweater is a really nice look, James.
https://youtube.com/@overkillandrew2?feature=shared If you guys like cool weird cars, check out my Kia it has a big turbo that sticks out of the hood
What a great idea for a video. Good job
hearing you say horsepower like a normal person just seems wrong.
audi rs4 avant is dreaaamssss
I felt that about the morotcycle/Noble car thing. Having survived 2 decent motorcycle wrecks i left that behind. My gamily doesnt need the risk just so i can ride a bike or have a super fast car.
2025 cars imported every day
COMPLETELY unrelated, but I'm watching 2 broke girls and I just saw you!!   "Holler" 🤣🤣🤣    nice pink hat btw
I’d like to see another video like this on Holden, GMs Aussie brand
I had a 02 IS300 for 8 years and i miss it, that Altezza Gita 5MT is a 5 for me:)
So a guy who is more than likely a multi-millionaire at this point thinks the French doing what they did to the wealthy was a good thing.  Got to love the hypocrisy of clown world.
I was just binging 2 broke girls on prime and JAMES is a actor for 1 tiny part of an episode on there, my god how amazing
Man this was probably the most depressing vid you've ever made.
I think I almost cried after you said the price for the RS4 Wagon
Love watching your videos. Always 🫶🏽. In the middle of fixing my mk3 cabrio 🤙🏽
Not import, but I grabbed kind of a cool one that’s ish-ish…  You’ll appreciate it, being a fellow VAG dawg. Lol  Still have my ‘95 GLX I bought off my older brother, driven to Waterfest 7, 8, 9, 10… Still my baby. Lookin’ to coupe it or swap it into different bones eventually.  So, anyway. Never knew there was an 8P A3 with a 3.2 VR. Started searching. Found their trans’ are apparently junk. Still searching, and found an 11’ A3 Quattro, facelift, black leather/ perforated gray alcantara LeMans seats out of an R8. Black Optics package. No glass roof/ no roof rails/full black upper interior. Set up quirky. Basically an S3 minus the Ko4 and a manual, sadly. Cool piece though. It was one of two in the states while I was searching. Still have ‘er, still everyday drive it after pulling it into the garage and doing a ton of work. Paid off and happy on the purchase, regardless of shit-ass direct injection.
At the beginning of the list he said affordable and then quickly forgot he said that
Imagine in 20 years they want to import a audi s1 👌
My guy, you were supposed to wait until after I imported these cars to inform the interwebs and jack up the prices!
Great vid, James.  Love your work, been following you since your start at the "fried ring-shaped pastry" channel.  Keep up the great work, looking forward to your next vid.
Bro that’s the Belgium flag not the German 🇩🇪
Two minutes into the video (Renault Clio) and you almost had me spit out my coffee laughing at you.😂
Keep it up James. Nothing but growing pains.
Absolutely love you guys, but the JZX110 image is actually a JZS171 (crown athlete V, as opposed to a Mark 2 iRV)
The Noble M12s built here in the UK were put together in a shed, so you're probably not much worse off doing it yourself 😂
Gold. Love you too bro😎
Second to last car is hideous🤮🤮🤮🤮
I think that was Holden is a Cadillac Catera with an LS1?
Look here kid. You can research repeat in front of the camera with the best of them, BUT this list is PACK FULL of your love for Hatchback cars.  PLEASE STOP TRYING TO STUFF YOUR FAVORITES DOWN OUR THROAT.  Become LESS bias.
VW New Beetle Turbo S
I just want to point out, the actual real life Car Market being mostly determined by what was cool in Gran Turismo, is WILD AS HELL. But also cool!
The prices stopped just when I needed to know
Hey, it's the guy that made Donut awesome.
Anyone who could afford #1 wouldn't have had to wait till now to import it
I would've thought you would be contractually obligated to not say hearsepers
what about the BMW E46 M3 CSL
Ford focus RS500???
How reliable are these? Lol
Where there f**k have you been with Donut? Like what happened, jerr and jobe are gone and haven't seen you in months
Can you do an episode on hotwheels collection culture?
I think the tiny vw hatches are the ones to get
You lost me at French
Have you guys heard of the beer purity law in Germany? Beer, by law, can have only water, barley and hops.  It’s different from anywhere else’s beer, including Belgium. Belgium beer is sold as “alcoholic beverage” but not as a beer in Germany. Please avoid confusion!😂😂😂
The t-shirt should read, "JDM 1999 Hard". You can have that.
Yo I think I have a Contact Idea that I think you would like to do.
Goat 🐐
All of these cars except the rare ones are cars I grew up around because our country economy is so small so we import everything from anywhere especially japan. The Altezza Gita is a beast. In my country altezzas are very much hated because some 12 years back roudy ricers disturbed the peace with them and lost a bunch of races😂😂
As a huge Holden fan I Would love to import a Clubsport. Actually I would import 2. An HSV and a regular Commodore and put a GTO front end on the Commodore
6:50 to put that in perspective the Corvette Z06 wasaking 400 HP with the LS6 in 2000
Every car company should make a mid engine rwd hatchback.
Yes please move in to a Whole Foods Parking Lot... We love filming when we tow cars away. It gets our store Instagram likes.
Eat the rich! And take their cars!
that TVR looks like a shoe.
hope all is well brother !!
Japan and Australia. Thats all i want.
Starting off with a bang! I've wanted a Clio since Forza 2!
The RS4 being legally imported is great news! However it will not stop the people in New Jersey from putting RS4 logos on Automatic 2.8 A4 Avants.
i see those Schmidts in the background
Yikes, looking rough
Why am I not surprised you’re watching checkpoint videos as well!
17:09 give those utes a few years they only get better
4:17 or? Why or? Do both!
I can't afford to import it now, Ya'll  know why.
My favorite is that Audi S3, if i didnt live in California i would buy one asap
6n is a very polo the lupo is just a lupo and the 6n2 is a facelifted 6n polo and has same running gear as lupo GTI but bigger
Dude that outro was so true, from 21:15 youre spot on until the end of the video. Great one too
No hilux no care
How I have missed your channel I do not know.  Great list!
I thought Altezza Gita never got the manual 3sge though?
Im still yet to see a TVR that's made it out the UK 😂
Just noticed you in arrested development s4 e9 ?
it got real deep at the end 😭
Watching this as a european is crasy
So the Nobles were available in the U.S. as the ROSSION Q1, with either a ecoboost 4 cyl or  6 cyl motor. You ordered it, they assembled it, and thats it. Just like Backdraft Racing Cobras. Both made (formerly for the Q1) right here in Florida.
While watching this @7:00, I'm literally working on a Reflex Purple TVR Tuscan light painting and photos right now!  James! Can I submit my photos to your show?
Saw that B5rs4 avant in the thumbnail. Im so hard right now.
lowkey somethings should be kept a secret..
Nice, I didn't know you had a channel
Me going into this video lowkey hoping the one I'm looking for *doesn't* get mentioned.  Edit: fuck it was mentioned.
JDM❤
Had a Ibiza Cupra. i loved this car. r.i.p. jimmy blue
Is that Klein Stage in the back?!
I love my '96 jzs155 crown royal saloon 2jz-ge option. JZ series all slapped
Bro, go watch the YouTube channel Seal on tour. I swear he is your long-lost Canadian brother! Cheers, greetings and salutations from a Texan living in Canada!
wtf is up with the huge mistake  using a Belgian flag for Germany? You guys are total b0z0s.
— but can’t own in California.
goes same for almost everything. music, tv shows, cinema, clothes, games, pc software. the 90's unique touch is gone. it's like people realized that they're living in simulation but can't wake up, so just spending rest of the days until then.
Appreciate it, broseph.
This guy looks like tom delonge
I so recomending that Audi A4s B5. Had 3 and It's good car. And that 1.8T is like dog what love running around :D
The new Donut crew, cramps the channel's style. #speeed
VOLVOOOOOO
Here in the uk a lot of those where boy racer/street racer car's especially the hatchbacks the lupo gti is actually on my list of wanted cars i miss the 2000s cars there kinda hard to come by now
which bozo confused the belgian flag for the german flag
Just got a jzx90. Really cool to see 110s are finally legal.
The best thing about the Clio V6 is that it wasn't even faster than the Clio 182 either on a track or in the real world. That's just peak f**k it we ball energy.
Isn't Pontiac G8 pretty much the same thing as the Holden?
Bruh, your average viewer aint importing a car. Personaly, I like to watch videos I can relate to.
Can you do the same thing for trucks and SUVs? Especially the offroad types
Chin up! You can always dress as weird and drive as unusual a car as you want. Don’t gentrify, be unique!
Bro belgium and germany are not the same u know that 🤣🤣
That vintage Polo tennis sweater tho
@11:25 that car shown is a Seat ibiza which is based on the polo platform. The black Seat Leon shown in the next photo is the one thats based on the golf and s3
Guys why you and most american love wagon cars?
In the Uk I think I’ve seen more convertible S15’s than coupes. They look like shit, irl.
Fyi...the Cupra 4 was a version of the Mk1 Leon Cupra,  the Ibiza Cupra..in your picture did not come with that as an option,
Sri Lankan come here😂
Nice bicycle! Made in Chehalis Washington by the MIT genius Gary Klein. And you love VW? are we cousins?
god we are lucky in the uk with the car selection we have
The Coolest thing since Free Luigi!    Being bloodthirsty for rich blood is cool, yeah!
These are great, but let's hear about those Aussie UTES! Ford Falcon TRUCK?? HELLZ YEAH!
So happy you're continuing to make content for us! Wishing you the best, and I can't wait to watch this channel grow! ❤
Audi is as exciting as content that involved you in Donut Media 💀💀💀 At least Donut is now watchable
Au falcon for sale, start your bids
Just wanted to point out, the seat ibiza is based on the polo, the leon is the golf ☺️ otherwise, fantastic work
Holy shit @checkpoint Japan spotted 🎉
Slow as hell, but I love my sub 5k Honda acty. Never smiled more driving anything.
Someone needs to check a map and their flags...  German flags are all incorrectly displayed as Belgian.
the only reason i recognized the clio was because i probably put 5000 hours in GT1 and 2 😂
THATS THE BELGIAN FLAG; NOT GERMAN FLAG😭😭
Cupras are sick i want one
is tvr has BMWs engines?
The Holden Clubsport looks like their Monaro without the hoodscoops.
If I already didn't have 6 B5s I would defiantly import an RS4
Literally bought my dream car because of CKY. Ferrari 360 babyyyy
The “Barely Legal” thumbnail was a lost opportunity.
Hey te escribo desde Panamá! Continúa con el buen trabajo Dave
Please name and shame that sweet lil chair youre rocking
I had a 2000 Audi A3 Sportback turbo. Same as the S3
The Renault and a Lancia Delta Intergrale are cooler than a GTR. I said what I said.
James, that rugby shirt goes hard.
damn you US guys are very strict... meanwhile in germany, a guy imports from the US a Crown Vic. Well an understatement car as well is the Lotus Omega 3.6L bi-turbo and RWD with 325HP topspeed 285kp/h 480 newton metres of torque 0 - 100 kph 4,8 seconds
Your telling you don’t know who Robert Plant is that who is in the pics with the opel
I think Germany will ban this channel after the editer used the belgium flag instead of the GERMAN FLAG😂
Next year you will be able to import the Holden Monaro. Which is basically the same but a 2 door coupe
Doesn't all the terrifs make this even more undoable than ever before?
Yup GM's last ditch effor to save Pontiac. The Holdens in Australia Became the last line of Pontiacs here, the G6 and what not.
As someone from the UK… don’t buy a VXR 220 😂. They are awful
Cant wait 3 years to import a 350gt skyline lol
adjust your rim breaks
I'm from Spain, and the Seat you put is a Seat Ibiza cupra R, like a vw polo with 1.8T 156cv engine, the most crazy thing with that engine w/o swap, and the Cupra 4 is a Seat León which had 3 Cupra versions, the Cupra 4 one with 4 motion and 2.8 VR6 204hp engine, the "cupra" with fwd and the engine of the early S3, 1.8T 210cv, and the Cupra R, another fwd with the same 1.8T as the late s3 8l with 225cv, known as the best 1.8T 20v engine to modified, the BAM
This video could have been 12 mins. I stopped watching donut because of the word "hearsepurs" clearly others hated it because they banned it. Will not be viewing anymore of these videos.
Love this channel, everything is well written and funny.
17:39 - someone forgot about "badge" and car that was already on USDM. Saturn Sky. Same chassis, same 2.0T. Just different badge.
10:45 - A3 8L is just a Mk4 Golf in different skin. Same parts. You can fit awd to a mk4 golf and it will fit like a glove. Or sock. No cutting, no welding. Just plug, remap the ECU (or standalone) and play.  Same with Seat Leon (Seat Ibiza is more VW Polo, no Audi model). Seat Leon mk1 is so "parts bin" that it uses... same dash as A3/S3.
7:51 Scotto is not gonna be happy with this recommendation
8:40 - if i remember correctly... there was two sedans in RS.
Sorry dude, but driving a 25 year old high strung German car and "not sweating it at all" means you don't care about getting to your destination. These are great hobby cars, but terrible daily drivers. Even the 2.7 twin turbo in the S4 is going to cause lots of headaches. I knew three people who owned them and every single one was leaking at least a quart of oil a month onto their garage floors by 50k miles.
And that's why California is a shit hole
Damn!! 400 hp out of a V6 i mean dayyyuuummm!!!
I love a-segment cars so the Lupo gti is the coolest car on this list.
Fun video, thanks guys!
Would like to see a video of cool cars that will be available to import 5 years from now
Love you too bro and totally get what you mean. Please keep posting and doing your thing.
I see Donut Media, I'm instantly not interested... Not because of the host, but because of the mic he's using. I know, that's petty af... But the things they did were uncalled for
Being a VAG enthusiast starting in 2006. dreaming of being able to import renuats ,and lupos and Cleo's and seats. This list just made me so fucking happy🎉❤
Man you’re dead on with cky2k, bam, and his Audi. I looked it up last year to see if I could afford one now!
Its not over untill I get my GOD D@NM 1 series hatchback!
Um..the TVR Tuscan is beyond cool. The maintenance is horrible, though
Cristiano Ronaldo used to have onde Audi S3
Just sold my 500hp JZX110  last year, great car and a far better buy than a JZX100. Better bang for your buck but a little less scene points.
Man YouTube still shadow banning you from my feed got all notifications on but never ever get any for this account
The Holden HSV Clubsport  looks like an AI generated Pontiac GTO
Dope video! Watching from South Africa & subbed!🙏🏽✨
You should do a collab with @diamomdmotorworks
me watching this as a canadian knowing i have been able to import these for 10 years
2025 and Belgians decided to get their revenge for WW I&II and just annexed Germany.
Clio V6 is such a bad idea, they're very rare even in europe and lot of parts are not manufactured anymore, it's literally prototype level of nightmare, legit one part away to fail and make the whole car a brick impossible to fix unless you find someone with the tools to make a new part, wich probably cost thousands.
The British marketed Lotus Carlton/Omega would be top on this list if it weren't such a rare and expensive used car. This thing was an absolute monster for 1991-93 and was significantly faster than the 300ZX TT and Dodge Stealth RT
I want a holden UTE in Canada sooo bad! Would be a fun car? Truck?
I remember seeing a yellow Audi S3 rip by me in Barcelona back in 1998, that thing stopped me in my tracks. Wanted one then, still do.
Also the mighty AU Falcon Forté can be now imported. With the waterfall grille 😅
22:11 all facts 💯🫡
Guns everywhere but some cool ass cars are illegal due to their age. This law needs to be abolished immediately
When I was a kid I was at a Vauxhall dealership with my dad, I think he was getting repairs for something. And they had a blue VX220 there, it was beautiful.
fock…..i completely forgot about the clio v6…for 30-40k, that is pretty awesome
My favorite fun affordable car, the Pagani Zonda
Can anyone else join the discord or are you getting that the link is expired as well?
"you could drive a b5 rs4 every day and not sweat it" why you spreading misinformation like that lmao what are you talking about  the 2.7t is notoriously awful to own and maintain
Love ya, James! Hi from the Dominican Republic 🇩🇴
Just looked up the Clio v6 carsales. Only 1 for 115,000 dollerydoos
i used to own a seat ibiza cupra, one of the best cars i’ve ever had!!
Keep doing what you're doing, brother. Much love for the new content. I'm officially on SPEEED! The Mrs. doesn't approve 😞
Goood. You didn’t mention the car im about to buy before people realize what it is and charge too damn much
at least make the german flag like it is 😅
Naw. Mr. MOPOWA mentioned the 8L. I'll take that clip to my grave
Germans will hate this video  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yoiu have the Belgium flag for German Cars...
The fact that you said you can drive a b5 audi with the 2.7 every day without worry shows how little you know about the platform lol.
Like a GtAV Chevy. You get what they copied, just enough to avoid law issues
as a 14 year old who cannot drive, I see this as a huge W.
Touareg R50 🤞🤞🤞
I think James is mixing the Seat León and the Seat Ibiza here. The former is the Spanish interpretation of the Golf, while the latter was the one of the Polo. Both had CUPRA versions.
My dream car is the Renault 5 Turbo Maxi. The OG 5 turbo and insain Group B rally car. But, I'd totally settle for the Clio. Dude in my town has/had a Williams F1 version (I'm in the UK 😜). It's crazy nuts cool
when do we get to talk about the Saab Sonett?
man here in canada i think it’s only 15 years
what´s that beat at 13:00 called?
calling the Audi s3 and Seat Ibiza the same is so American
I want all of the Audis!!!
Seat ibiza its a vw polo Platform like skoda fabia and audi a1
ZONDA IS 25 YEARS OLD WTF
I guess James really liked Donut's "list" content
telling people to buy 25 year old audis is diabolical
I'm still just waiting for the BA Falcon🥲
so uhm, how did all the german cars end up coming from belgium ?
CKY MENTIONED🗣🗣 WHICH SIMULATOR WE DISENGAGING??
Well great now I have to import a Toyota Origin.
OUT HERE
Love this channel I get cars are big part the community bc of donut but I love the other videos of your other interests a lot more
I love you James
Doesn’t the German sound for the W is the V sound? Maybe that’s why Wheeler is a V in the acronym. Help me if I’m wrong
Man I wish I had 250,000 dollars
LUPO MENTIONED RAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
James, what happened to your pizzazz? It makes me sad not seeing you being a spaz..
That variety is soo fuggly lol
I was born in '89. There was something special about 1987-2002. The last of individuality for sure. A1.
Lil but of misinformation. They go by manufacturer date means 2000 good chance it could built in 99
The Toyota Alteza we call a Lexus IS300 The Toyota Estima is nothing but a Toyota Previa A Volkswagen GTI is not a thing ...... because there are multiple.  A Golf GTI, a Bora GTI, a  Lupo GTI, a Up GTI .... all Volkswagen GTI's That HoldenCommodore is nothing but a rebadged Opel Omega B, made by Opel in the 90's, when it still was under GM.
There is a real truth with on a approved buy list, one of the categories is: was on Gran Turismo. Haha. A1
A1
Germany 🇩🇪 ❌ Belgium 🇧🇪 ✅
I Neeed that Lupo ..!! (See what I did there ..?)
Seeing the cupra as a Spanish dude for no reason makes me incredibly happy
Yooooo, love y'all.
What was the cool factor score for the RS4?
Rooting for this dude 🏆 I hope he is as cool behind the scenes as he is on camera… i dont wanna hear no chit
Can we have a bicycle episode? That yellow bike in the background always catches my eye
16:37 it looks like it's a mix of a JDM car an American Chevy car
AUDI B5 RS4 AVANT IS THE GREATEST CAR EVER
Where are Part 1,2,3 and 4?
❤
Uneducated American, funny
You are such a big role model for me man, you've changed me for the better, love you <3
Can you please remake the video and use the German flag instead of the Belgium flag? I think we are owed a public apology!
time for all these cars to spike up in value once theyre importable in the US
This is exactly why I opted to buy a 23 Kona N, I honestly think Hyundai is making great strides to be unique and set themselves apart for other auto makers. They're killing it, love them or hate them they're doing it differently
the widebody renault fxckin went super sonic☠️
James, Ibiza is the Polo of Seat, and Leon is the golf
In Canada we have been able to have all these for the last 10 years as we only have to wait 15 years to import
Fun fact. The VX Clubsport 16:39  is just a 4 door Pontiac GTO and it’s the great great great grandfather of the Pontiac G8 & Chevy SS
SPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED! not the drug!
Mitsubishi Mirage Cyborg R not on the list!?!? Boooooooooo!
The only thing I wish this channel did was put out videos more often. I know it just like two of you guys so I know you can’t just push them out.
this feels like you and your buddy just sit with a couple cold ones and talk about cars,just good time,thank you James
Car got totaled immediately after watching this - must be a sign
What chair are you sitting in? Looks very elegant. :)
Rocket money is the next Honey. Mark my words.
8:29 missed a few crucial items here including larger factory turbos
That last point you made is true in more ways than I'd prefer. Games, music, etc. Everyone saw a formula that works and decided to copy it and profit. No one takes a risk on something new much these days n it's pretty boring.
Dude, we love you too
Seat cupra 4 would be a dream to drive.
Great vid! Love it!  Loved the 90's too
v(W)ilkinson.... son
I just bought a S3 8l interstate sight unseen from an auction and I might be the most excited I've ever been to get my car.  Sick to see it featured in the video!
Don’t forget the Clio was an iconic car from Need for Speed Most Wanted.
Are you sick my guy? You lookin thin. I'm concerned, really
VR5 VWs 👀👀
CHECKPOINT JAPAN MENTIONED :D
bro the end is so real : /
WRONG! The VW Bora WAS the VW Jetta in Europe until 1998, it was only in Europe it changed name for some stupid reason, but the Bora and Jetta are the same car.
I watched this 2 days ago and I got on Facebook marketplace just to see a 1982 Renault turbocharged for 40k lmao
Vans/Minivans are sick! I saw a 1996 Nissan Caravan in near showroom condition for sale for 12,000 a couple months ago and I almost bought it. They're such a niche but imo cool type of vehicle.
10:42 you can get those in Canada 😊
Smooth ad transition 😂😂
Finally the americans can experience the unreliableness of Audi b4 platform. Its good, when it works, which is kind of always but also never.
Yh right you don't got 250k you got 1.3million subs
can't wait to see more of our common cheap cool cars get more expensive to adjust for the demand of Americans trying to export them lol
That Clio makes a lot more sense when you remember they'd been doing this since the Renault 5 Turbo (which was what it was because they needed to homologate it for rally).
Ls430 @15:17 is mine for sale located in Miami. Hmu
SEAT CARS ARE AWESOME. ARRIBA ESPAÑA!!!!
Honda E, nissan sakura. tons of chinese city cars. there's still gonna be new stuff that doesn't come over. what I know is mostly kei sized cars though.
Didn't know Belgium built so many cool cars.
2:17 no, but I am. Your move, Mario.
Does anyone know where to find an easy guide to importing cars?
@8:41 The B5 RS4 also came in a sedan dubbed the Limousine.. C’mon James, you’re a VAG guy, you should know this !!
I would kill for a Noble M12....Ultimate dream car for me.
The discord link isn't working
Belgium...
Ibiza is based on vw polo not mk4 golf… 😅
About seat, the ibiza is the small hatch, and cupra versions are just insane, the seat leon cupra comes with the 1.8t from Volkswagen with 225hp or the 2.8 VR6 with 204 hp. The fr versions with the 1.9 TDI are absolutely insane. You could push 300hp just with a hybrid turbo, intercooler an exhaust and a remap. A friend of mine has a 1.9 tdi leon pushing 430hp with bolt-on parts and has put it a lot of miles and is still pushing strong
I saw the thumbnail for this video and was in awe I was born and raised in Mexico and we have Renault Clios or Nissan Platinas for the more common folk my mom had a Platina and it was so fun to drive (drive a slow car fast 😂) when Need for Speed Most Wanted came out the Clio was one of my favorites!! Now I need to save money 😂😂
Sensational
Built in a garage or built in a (noble) factory from that time is basically the same thing. All just depends on who built it and how good of a mood they were in during that time. Or how much beer they drank at lunch.
Tell em whats my car in the tier, got a 1967 vw beetle. Wide rear tires and wide ass on it. if its possible it would be cool to send som sort of dm or something
I didn't know I wanted a Toyota Altezza Gita until now... Thanks
thats not germany... thats belgium
Heck yeah , and i lagit want #15 #13 #11 😅  . (I have 2 kids , so i try to make sure all my future builds have room ).  Great vid james , can we get an update on your whips and maybe a walk around , overview, and maybe a drive .. call it silly , but i would like to hear an update on your personal builds (something relatable).. anyways , mad respect, brotha , peace and love brotha, keep it rad, stay safe, and build on..l8r famz and keep having fun
Can I just say that I'm so happy to see you, man.  Donut ain't shit withoutcha
Really enjoyed this. 🫶
Literally came back to this video to find the book club 🤓
We got a real life infernus before gta 6
You can already get a b6 s4, which is those VAG cars in one.
“Pyimp” New vocal stim unlocked
Donut media failed hards asf. Its straight fornite broccoli hair energy
4motion 1.9 TDI gimmmee allattt
Slowly waiting for a R36 Passat Wagon myself.
I'm so glad you guys are finding out about Opel Speedsters. it's the first car that made me hype as a kid. I passed by one at the dealership every day omw to school. And finally some credit to Belgium. Our car industry is down bad atm.
whoo has money to buy a 10-15k € car holy shit i mean if i was rich yes. but like most people in france drive fuking scrap cars. like 500-3000€ cars  if you drive a bmw orr mercedes they think ur riche when i was 18 i had a bmw e36 318i (115hp) and people tought i was a drugt dealeer. i said mate ur girlfriend has a peugeot 206 that car cost more then my bmw. (i got  it for 1200€ befor it was a hype drift car in like 2012) and still people tought i was rich by driving to school in a bmw. pretty funny doh. cause befor my bmw i drove a more expensive toyota rav4 140hp 2L from like 1995 or older that car was worth more then the bmw. am 30now and still drive 2K € cars only a audi a6 c5 v6 3.0L befor i had a mercedes clk200 kompressor from 2000 for 5 years cost me 2.2k €
Ideally every car would identical, save the top shell. No proprietary anything. Just a couple different connectors. Everything standardized and open source.  Then you simply select and customize the outer shell and plop it on top.
I’m gonna wait to get an ep3 type r
I’m just gonna import a Nissan S cargo and be the coolest cat in the land
4:50 thats nog the right flag for germany😅
Mungkin Mimpi Ganteng Surya 😅
Modern times gives “if everyone is special no one is special.”
So many hatchbacks and wagons lol
I’ve always thought Clio v6 was so cool
Damn .. so many cars from Belgium... didn't know they had that big of a car industry. Makes the Germans look weak AF...
crap
Ooh should I buy a R34 GTR or down payment on a house....
When you said Bam Margerra's B5 S4.... the hairs on my body stood up. That was THE car when I was growing up watching CKY in high school in the early 2000s. Glad to know I wasn't the only one.
Lmaooo you added a van segment.  And no cap I'm actually trying to wrap a van with my business logos (420 Blaze It haha)
These cars give me so much Gran Turismo 3 and 4 nostalgia
They will ban it in California like ALL other classic cars
The noble m12 was built in a shed even if you bought it directly from noble
Some really cool stuff here.
"and it comes in this cool purple" ... Mall Ninja 😂
Audi 8L A3/S3 is one of my dream cars. Love the content and have been a big fan since early donut ❤
As a Belgian seeing this the flag really made me second geuss myself on which one was actually ours 🤣
It's typical that Americans use the wrong flag for Germany. I'm surprised they didn't use the Dutch flag for French cars
Renault put an F1 engine in a 7 seater family bus the Espace F1 which was also in Gran Turismo
Is that the old Donut mic you stole before you lift? You sound exactly the same. James........
250k???????????? skylines used to sell for 15k to 35k usd here, unsure if they gone up now, b0t was never a fan of the ricerboiler scene, but saw them for sales on shows and markets anyway
I will always have a special place in my heart for the Clio V6 I stumbled upon it in NFS Most Wanted 05
this guy is dramatically overestimating how much i want to see his face
why is there a belgium flag on the german cars?
uk car market and pricing is different to most europe for many reasons, rhd cars move for half the price almost, clio v6 everywhere else is 60-100k and during collector cars boom few years ago went even past that
Why did he stop scoring them and telling us how much theyd cost 😂😂😂
You should see my 16” FK2 Type R GT that’s one spicy car America doesn’t have
Didn't know I'm Belgian
Dang homey- someone got on Ozempic‼️🤣✌🏽✌🏽 even your voice is higher pitched‼️🤣🤣🤣🤣
James, love the videos but your using a Belgium flag instead or a German one on the German cars 🤣😂
And the coolest 1.8t is the Skoda Octavia VRS WRC. Get a video on Skoda please
What’s with the Belgian flags ?
Audi RS4 , s3 and Opel ist German ?
my favorite affordable car, a pagani zonda
TVR gets a 0 but the van gets a 5? Tf, specially with your rant at the end?
15, 11, 6 in that order
4motion being legal is huge
I don't have $250000, do you? No? So here's affordable* PAGANI ZONDA for just a $7mil
123hp isn't a lot for any car. My motorcycle has more horsepower lol.
The commentary on pop cultures’ convergence causing the extinction of individuality was surprising yet resonant
18:33 i’ve been lucky to meet the owner of that noble and he was nice enough to let me sit in it. cool as hell, just barely fit in it. cool to has such a unique car in minnesota.
8:53 wagons > sedans/SUVs
Yo you had a heart attack bro?
Renault Clio V6 was my favorite car (hatch back) after the GTI growing up
love you man
There was a Clio V6 in my city the dude daily drove it for years. Now I realized what a hero this guy was. A legend
Clio all the way!
Fun fact 1: The person who introduced Pagani to Lamborghini was Juan Manuel Fangio, five-time F1 world champion  Fun fact 2: In 2024 Horacio Pagani traveled to Argentina, bought and took home an IKA TORINO 380W  Fun fact 3: The history of the Torino 380W deserves a video of its own as it is an extremely rich history with names like Juan Manuel Fangio and Pininfarina. I recommend this video to learn a little more about its history: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEu_HGzcCsk
Intro made my day
2:35 "In California you're allowed to live in the parking lot" truer words have never been spoken. Let's hope CA turns it around and becomes livable again.
i want the rs4 so bad
Does this mean you can import the newest version of the Clio?
On the subject of Renault , you should check out the F1 V10 powered Renault espace 2:44
Hecc yea boi
Anyone knows why Cars From Japan website still shows only 1999 and older cars ok to import?
They'll all be too expensive for the average person to afford, keep hustling guys!
I miss when you screamed like a wild banshee in your vids lol
you are a great story teller... i like how you explain things and make them funny ... Saludos de Monterrey Mexico.
Wanna hear a spooky 👻 Ghost Story? It’s also a joke! 😁😂     Donut Media 🍩 🤣 🤣 😂 😂
Please tell me you didn't just say you can daily a B5 S4 with no worries.  Good god.
I’ll Take The RS4 Avant ❤❤❤😊
07:50 - This car is why I am even watching this list.  The B5 RS4 Avant and the B7 RS4 Avant are the dream cars!
2000 vw golf TDI 4motion for me.
They made a JZS171 Crown Wagon?!? A clean one with a mint interior on some Work VSKF's would go so hard as a daily VIP
“we just can’t make videos like this anymore” James we got at least another 15 years before a downfall. I’m expecting these videos for another 15 years. Don’t let me down James
For the Lupo I’m basically picturing a fiat abarth 500 or like a mini cooper s but a gti
James definitely has 250k but I appreciate him relating to us still🤣😭
disposable society
Australian cars are just the matchbox versions of American cars haha. Or vice versa.
How to tell you got educated in America without saying it?
You were expecting this comment about the noble, but you were wrong.  James, we had the Opel Speedster here, under 2 brands.  Saturn Sky and Pontiac Solstice.
I'm all for the very 1st one, the Clio v6 is, and has been my dream car for about 25 years.
Just subscribbed, you guys made the donut
Whoops🇩🇪...............🇧🇪
I love it when our aussie muscle gets some love
Hey dude, the Seat you guys show mostly is an Ibiza 6N. Which is the small tiny little brother of the car you are on about, the Leon Cupra. The fun Leon's could be had with both a regular 150hp 1.8T, 180hp 1.8T or 225hp 1.8T, but those were all FWD if I'm right. The one you want ia the 204hp 2.8 VR6 powered one, with 4motion AWD😎 Leon shares its platform with the Golf and Bora etc. While the Ibiza is just a tiny Polo under the skin, with an engine the Polo of that gen never came with (1.8T, only the later gen Polo 9N got that engine). Just wanted to say that as a quick note, for the rest awesome video and thanks for making my dreamcar even more expensive now🥹😂 I'll never own a B5 RS4, I'll just have to be happy with my B5 A4 1.8T forever (which I am, I love B5 Audi's)
Screw the lipo GTI.  Save some money and scoop up an ep3 civic
I Always wanted a Renault Clio soo Nice
Speeed Addickkkts Assemble
Oh hey, an ex Donut man… Wonder if he’s still dealing with daddy issues. Subbed.
You know that the flags at Volkswagen and Audi are belgian, right? 👀
A Ford Falcon XR6 would tickle my fancy.😉
Love you man, thank you for the pure content!
Peep the donut mic
That vert S15 is fugly   your a vw guy so I get it
the TVR is one of my top 5 childhood dream cars, it was in PGR4
love you man
Your the best James
Title is wrong, i cant afford to import a belgian paperclip
The Clio v6 launched in 2001, I think you gotta wait until next year =(
Rocket Money more like Rocket Bunny 👌🏽
I'd also add Fiat Coupe 20V Turbo Plus 1999-2000 MY. Back when Fiat made awesome cars and not 1000 iterations of the 500.
Bro James needs more views on these videos
Series 70 Land Cruiser
So we're gonna gas over GT and not about the TVR?
THANK FUCK YOU MENTIONED THE SEAT, I HAVE ONE (the cheap, rolling coal one, 1.9 TDi for life)
More fun cars you can import now from Opel are the Calibra( sporty coupe wit a 4 cyl Turbo/NA up to a V6 all whell drive) Opel Astra F GSI ( 2.0 Turbo) or if you want a small Coupé you can get your self a Tigra and put in a Engine from the Calibra or Astra.
I like the random Klein bike in the background. I’m assuming someone rides?
Belgian flag instead of Germany! This couldn't be more American! 😂
Wait did you actually have a heart attack
Should I buy a Mark 2  1gz gte
Love these videos about cars, format, info, everything. Keep up the good work
🇧🇪 = Belgian 🇩🇪 = German
You should absolutely buy an 8L S3, I’ve owned 2 in my history. Both facelifts, a black 210hp AMK engine and a red 225hp BAM. Both really really nice cars, although the gearbox went on the red one and it was just a dog after that. Almost swapped it for a white mk2 golf with a 2.9 VR6 and 16v recaros. I didn’t end up going through with it and that’s one of my biggest car regrets 😂 You should also try a Lupo GTI, had 2004 one with OE black heated leather, lovely car but after getting overtaken by a 6n 16v with 4 lads in I did a straight swap on a vr6 mk3 with a stage 2 vortec charger kit
The Audi S3 quattro (in color gray) was my dream when I was in high school. I'll never have one.
Im 5,10 250 pounds and i cant drive big cars or trucks i like tiny but space effecient apso the end message hit home man keep your head up as well james we all support you and hope for the best with the channel
As if the Clio V6 could get any more expensive!
Love how I get the OG donut vibe from your videos. Keep it up man
TVR, the W is upsidedown. See it?
1:43 My first child exposure to it was NFS Most Wanted in 2005!
Unfortunately the Clio V6 RS isn’t available to the US yet in a road legal trim. 2000 was the Clio V6 Trophy which was a track only model and the road legal model began production in 2001.
You should make a video on the coolest shoes
AU Falcons - skid machine
Just completely abandoned the affordable part 🤣
Like the D-list lol
Have you seen the Lupo Gti ad on TV 2003
Clio V6 is my dream car😩😩
Way to insult the Germans by using the Belgian flag for their cars.
I've wanted a Clio since I first drove one on Forza Motorsport.  Love that weird little car
Hey James , sorry to correct you but the Altezza Gita (wagon) never came in a 3sge Beams 4banger. They did come with a manual option but only with the 6 cylinder 2L 1GFE. The non turbo 2JGE version only came in automatic/tip but with a rwd or awd configuration. Source - i crashed one. my first car
Wagons are quick in Europe. I was stationed in Germany in the mid-2000s and had a 735 for my Autobahn cruiser. My cruising speed was between 120-140, and German wagons were regularly passing me like I was sitting still.
From this list I see we aren’t missing much
We love you too James. #MakeKindnessNormal
I'd like to see a video expanding upon that idea at the end of this one - The melding of cars, fashion, music, etc. In that, it went from unique and romantic to generic and mass-appealing. Great theory that deserves to be expanded upon! Also, a Brabus Van would be a boss import.
Performance about nobles is a bit misleading as most of the nobles that came in as “kit cars” to be finished in the United States end up being better built, and the ones that came from the Noble factory.
An awful lot of poor editing and absentee producing. When you are so lazy as to flip photos and not realizing that one shows the car as a right hand drive and the other shows the same cars as a left-hand drive it is pure laziness. And someone did a poor job of producing this and must apparently have no knowledge of cars to show these vehicles or at least many of them as right hand drive cars when they were never produced in right hand drive. This seems to be following a general trend of poor production and editing work since the division of skills from this group.
TVRs are one of the most unreliable cars ever made. Just like almost anything on wheels out of Britain.
6N Lupo?  6N is a Generation of VW Polo.  A Lupo is a Lupo, unless it’s a SEAT Arosa.   GTI Lupo has aluminium body panels and a 6 speed gearbox.  Very rare these days.  Lupos weren’t built that well.
Speed x BigTime colab?? They took away the best donut hosts and replaced yall with trash 🗑️
The 25 year rule is so friggin dumb. Our massive gubment is becoming so authoritarian.
the lupo wasnt producied in belgium till 2003, before that they were produced in germany.
TVR made a knockoff dodge viper that is gorgeous
I can't wait till all cars are just souless chinese iphones with wheels that can do 0-60 in like 1 second.
wrong german flag xD
Better get em before the Trump tarriffs kick in lol
The varietta looks like a 1994 mustang
damn fam no homo but i kinda love you too
Commodore Ute!!
I really thought you had tvr over there with the film swordfish, John travolta character has one
James you're waaaaaay too good at what you do
Yayyyyyyy we can import them, now that we can't afford them !!!!
Weird times for sure brother. Peace.
Sorry man, that shirt looks like you have cancer.
Up here in the 51st State we only have to wait 15 years! Hahah!
James the lupo is not cooler than the clio, tripppppin mate😂 still love ya thoo I promise
JAMES! GREAT TO SEE YOU DUDE! LOVE YOU BRO!
Small correction,  '6n' refers to the related Polo which the lupo is based on. The interior of the Lupo is lifted straight from the 6n2 Polo
CKY mentioned let’s goooo!
The Clio V6 is more traitorous in corners than old 911s.
TVR Speed 12
CLIO!!!!🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
Where the 147 GTA ?
Why is no one talking about that sweater?
James -20kg? Ozempic ? 😊
Who owns the full carbon countach??
Renault has entrusted the development of Clio V6 chassis to TWR in England Clio V6 but the car is dangerous. For gen2 Renault itself took over the development and the car appeared much less vicious.
I saw this guy in a key and peele skit 😅
Why was the cars forbiden in USA?
That Clio was my go to starter in all the forza motosports
I love how the thumbnail is the first car, meaning it'll get better
lol Belgium
Any Japanese VIP car will do. But i need that Holden
You've used the Belgian flag instead of the German. We don't produce anything.
What about Ford Escort RS Cosworth? I am disappointed it didn’t make to the list 🤷🏼
why the belgian flag tho?
James u should stick to cars bro the other content is cool . But as a og viewer the other content is boring
For the no. 10 I can add that there also is Audi TT mark1 with BAM(225hp) engine and a quattro system from the S3. Basically it is Audi unofficial S model of the TT, because for the mk1 TT there where no TTS. And then there is mk1 Audi TT Quattro Sport, that could be TTRS by todays standards. Those TTs with 225hp engines in the UK are dirt cheap.
Turbo AWD or RWD Wagons turn me on.
Every time I see a Renault Clio in a racing game I jump on it. Something about it just screams “I’m the quiet kid you should worry about” and I fall for it every time
It's surprising how many cars never made it to the US
damn man you make a great video, I imagine that's why speed started, and your full potential was realized. The sincerity at the end there is really relatable, weird times indeed. Liked the "where do we go from here." fade out. Cheers
I’ve always wanted the Clio V6 that thing is so awesome remember it from like top gear and the British car rags I used to look at.
The Clio V6's are a bit more expensive than that but you can get the budget option (without RWD and a V6) which is nearly as good with the Clio 172. Worth a look for anyone seriously thinking of going down that route. Fantastic cars.
The Toyota Cresta should have gotten a side mention with the Crown. Last year of production for them was 2001.
I'm almost sure Wycliffe Jean had a Pagani zonda
A specific type of fun😂 please elaborate!
Pretty soon and you guys can steal europe's Alfa Romeo's. 147 and 156 are so cheap still
Huh. That TVR looks really familiar. I wonder if it was in a game I've played.
"Stand out. Cool as hell. From Gran Turismo." It's basically the same car. You would be dumb not to get it.
Belgium rules🎉❤
Daaamn son
like the lupo , i have a vw up gti 1.0 3 cilinder turbo 116hp original 220nw upgraded now 136hp 248nw  950kilogram, literally a gokart feeling 😂😂 lupo gti en up gti are so fun to drive.
I haven't audibly laughed in so long and that bit about having your heart attack and it being disrespectful to your family to ride a motorcycle or drive a Noble M12 was just the ticket. Thank you James, happy you're well.
Bikes when
I think we have until cars produced until 2010 will still have some flavour
James its the wrong flag 🇩🇪 🇧🇪
Dude, you cannot just buy a Pagani. Pagani chooses who can buy his cars. Horatio (and/or his son) decides who they allow to have the opportunity to buy one of their cars, it's invitation only. That is why they are so pretistigious and so hard to get.
the US just gets our shit cars 😂 p.s. the german
RE: Clio - doesn't it have a frunk?  If no, why not?!
it’s volKSwagen ffs… 🤦🏻‍♂️
I thought it was just me. Those flags are wrong
you are correct, sir. good vid, great insights, thanks
430k in 1 day damnnn!! keep killing it man
Tuscan Speed 6... speaking of Gran Turismo legends. I made a lot of bank in GT3 as a middleschooler in my cranked-up yellow TVR Tuscan Speed 6. Never did unlock the unbuyable Speed 12, but I did warp to the dealership to look at it many times.
All these cars suck
The Clio is finally here in the states?
Nobody and I mean nobody hursperz like James!!!!!❤
Love the content and the Klein in the background. Much Love !!!
11:47 in the year 2000, global car production reached its Piëch.   thank you, I'm here all wiëch
15 cars which will skyrocket in price because Americans can finally import them*
Once again Balkan culture shows that they're in front of everyone at least 25 years🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
As an Aussie I own a VX GTS which was the king of hill back in the day, if you come over to Australia happy to throw you the keys for a day!
You should get a Peugeot 406 Coupé, the car has a version with a 210HP engine made in collaboration with Porsche, and the design was made by Pininfarina, yes, the guy from Ferrari. It’s not expensive for the moment, around 10-15K$, and the car looks good !
What are the laws on importing Japanese Kei cars (not trucks) in the states?
Thanks for using my Renault Clio V6 in your video @1:55 😊🙌🏽 - I can confirm these are one of the coolest cars to come out of France. Performance is pretty decent - turning circle is the worst ever!
Is affordability in the video too?
it's renault FIVE turbo two actually
Amazing host and editing!
The Audi A1. Gosh i remember they were so plentiful and crap that there was a point in time that you could have picked one up for less than £100
Hi James, Fix the typo at 13:55. It says 4-cylider
20:28 if the founder of Lamborghini was there he would have made it. Lamborghini fixed Ferrari problems not copying what they were currently offering
Affordable? 😂
A TL;DR list if you don't want to watch the video:  Renault Clio V6 Nissan Silvia S15 Varietta (Convertable)  Volkswagen Lupo GTI TVR Tuscan Speed 6 Audi RS4 Avant Cosworth Audi S3 Seat Cupra 4 Toyota Altezza Gita Toyota Estima Toyota JZX110 Toyota Origin Holden HSV VX Clubsport Opel Speedster Noble M12 Pagani Zonda
I’ve been telling people about the Clio V6 for YEARS! Thank you for ruining my incredibly low competition for one.
Awesome!
America has a 25 year law whilst my country has a 5 year old restriction
LOL 25 years 😂  15 FTW here in Canada. Love my MK1 RS Focus
Dude, Putler is trying to start a WW3 already. Why would you poke the Germans so bad mistaking their flag in the context of best of German engineering - their amazing cars?
The Clio V6 and the Opel Speedster were workhorses of early game Gran Turismo 2 and 3
The Toyota Origin was a special edition car to celebrate something or other, it's supposed to look like something they made in 1955 that was often a taxi.
I'm so sad the Clio V6's are coming over to the US! Seriously expensive now a days and it's only going to drive up the prices. Enjoy them.
My first car was a VW Lupo GTI ant that german enginering was really well made so wasn’t scary at all to drive…. But could also be because I was 18 and had not developed the ability to think of the consikvenses yet
Those cars are old. You should come to europe we have all of these
I'm surprised the Morgan Plus 4 wasn't included.  Even more surprised that no one in the comments mentioned it (yes I went through the entire comment section hitting "cmd/ctrl + f").
You should do a video on the Honda Logo GA3
Crazy times but we get dope car content from you thank you
I'm really starting to come around to some the wagons, hatchbacks, and luxury sedans. The Clio and RS4 Avant are pretty sweet!
How come u messed up on the flags here, ur using the Belgium flag instead of the German flag, which has the same colors but the stripes are different
cars before 2000 had soul. that hasn't been so common since; reducing with each passing year.
When's the Speeed BigTime crossover happening?
Totally get the comment about all cars being the same. Driving a manual 1st Gen Honda crv and once we put the car play and kill switch in it then it had all the amenities new cars have so we haven't been convinced to get one. And it stands out from a crowd cause its a fricken manual crv baby!!!
I thought the book club was going to center around car oriented subjects but was surprised to see in a flash that Cormac McCarthy's "all The Pretty Horses" is a candidate.  I have to say though someone sorta missed an opportunity by not suggesting McCarthy's "The Road".
Love the passion in these videos. Wish y’all took a little more time fact checking your info though.
It won't be impossible to find stuff to import in coming years. You got stuff like the TVR Sagaris, Renault Megane RS 275 and tons more. You just gotta look for regional exclusive manufacturers. I'm waiting for the Lotus 340R but that won't be available until next year
Sad, right when I clicked on this video I said "too bad most of us can't afford the cars we've wanted since 90s/2000s" Only to be disgusted at an R34 price...
wheres the cars for broke boys video
I am owner of a fiat Ferrari loaded dealers edition
Those Belgians sure build some nice cars, waffles and chocolate
The guy in the VX220 pictures. Is that Robert Plant?
The MW2 challenge complete sound for the S15 😂
Seriously considering an Altezza Gita (MT swapping it of course). 2JZ wagon baby!
You should make a video on the Yamaha banshee 👍🏼
+10 for Dark Matter. Read it years ago. Amazing story. TV series was good too
holden ute
I can't imagine right hand drive manual...
Donut had 400k views after 1 week. Speeed passed that in 1 day. Love this channel's progression.
I need a list for us big boys. From full size cars to trucks. I wanna see a list specifically tailored to the big and tall men and women of the world
Keep an eye on Seats James, they can be crazy machines. You would like one from 2005 up to 2010
The fact you didnt throw a picture of @nickscraig s15 varietta is criminal. 4:06
That opal is basically a Saturn sky redline
Thank you!
you should review proton and perodua
i want a van
That clio V6 with that side fender looks like an audi R8's cousin or something.
Man, how that was ended was so real.
Paraphrasing what you said at the end, "..kind of like how the world in a way has become less special, less romantic" [aka - more boring and repetitive, where everyone plays by the "rules" of profit]..thats probably the most simple wording I've heard used to describe the modern world while still being wonderfully poetic; and why I'm so happy that although I missed the 60s I still got to live through the 90's and I will cherish that forever
Thank you James for being you, the authentic moments of real are what make this channel shine!
When I think of cars people want to import, they are only Japanese cars.
Why am I watching how I met your mother rn and seeing James in an episode 😂😂😂
i love you james pumphrey
10:12 skip ad
"Other America" hahahaha I'm sorry but don't you dare compare us to your country 😂😂😂
man that outro had me choking up a little bit. lots happening in this world and i do see what you mean about 2000 being the last time any of it had some special kind of spark. love you too dude see you at book club.
fun fact: a revised version of the 3s-ge was used for racing by toyota. in a video by the squidd he mentions some tunes for the 503e (revised 3s-ge) could get it to run up to 1000hp.
Ibiza is Polo counterpart, seat version of golf mk iv is leon (hatch) or Toledo (sedan)
Hey man fellow Kentucky guys GO CATS!! You crush these lists and make them a great learning experience love this!!
Fiats, alfa romeos, citroen, Peugeots, there are many cars that I would add to this list.
2:07 actually the clio v6 is notorious for being very complicated to drive. it has a short wheel base, its lightweight, mid engine and has a lot of power for such layout. the closest thing it can be compared to is the lancia stratos, a rally legend infamous for being almost undrivable (thanks to its short wheel base, lightweight and lots of power) but ridiculously fast if you could get it right.
He should do a top 10 of Japanese imports for 2000
Dont make me get a fuckin S15 vert what
Glad to see some respect on holden's name
Well today I lerned about the 25 year car rule for America
❤
Is that a seat cupra ??
That Klein!!!
Love that he still uses the donut mic
B5 s4 is one of the best looking cars ever. I love those 5 spoke s4 wheels.
Algorithm
As the 2000s start we can see the transition from the JDM golden age to the golden era of European Hot Hatches!
Y is that ending giving me Midwest emo reviewbrah vibes?
No ford falcon?
Love you too bro beans. God bless you!  I definitely in a couple years wanna get the blueberry from psych when that gets legal. As far as I could tell the hatchbacks were only sold in Canada, Australia, and in Japan under another name.
Honda City vtec
Missed Nissan Stagea. GTR wagon
My forbidden fruit is the Alpine
If youre still doing these in 2040 you the Honda S660 will finally be legal for import 😂 2 door, mid engine, RWD 👀 (and 65 hrsprs)
Mate, the Holden VX was an Australian Icon. And were used as the base for Vauxhal, Pontiac and Chevrolet back in the early 2000.  Every gearhead in Australia, grew up driving or wanting the Commodore. We had so many options during the VX era. Saloon, Sedan, Stateman, Ute, and crewman. The top tier "you truly are a petrolhead" ones were the HSV, Monaro and Maloo models. Each cool and beautiful cars that like a good woman, would beat your ass for disrespecting them.
Talking about vans. I just purchased a 95 Honda Acty Street Raccoon kei van. I absolutely love this thing and highly highly recommend getting one for its small size, fuel economy, and RHD with a manual 5spd
VAN VAN VAN VAN!!!
Cars used to be: terrible. Cars still are: terrible. Cars are becoming: even worse.  Trains used to be: awesome. Trains still are: awesome! Trains are becoming: even better!
15:10 I thought there was a Donald Trump impression coming...
After the r34 there Is nothing that excited me anymore on the import list.
Welp... now we need an Speeed episode on Harcio Pagani... pretty please 🙏 ❤
missed opportunity to call speed book club "speed read"
With the exception of like 5 of them ive seen all of these cars in my country. Sucks to be a yank, mostly because youre a yank, but also the cars you cant have 😂
Thanks James. Interesting journey youve got going on
Had a VX220, insanely good fun and cheapish to run as it's a parts bin car. Definitely worth a better score!
Finally a video i wanna Watch! More Car stuff!! Miss up to speeed!
Please make a canadian version where the rule is 15 years!!
I don't think I remember from history class that Belgium invaded Germany haha haha
My man forgot the Ford Scorpio Cosworth
We're 20 years away from getting the Toyota Yaris GR! Not all is lost.
Fuck I love James. Such a solid dude with such a great perspective on life!
I always thought the Speedster was a Saturn Sky, but the Sky/Opel GT replaced the Speedster, but still used the same engine.
although the Clio is bad ass, the worst part is parts and labor for maintenance would be a nightmare. No one here has ever seen em or worked on em and I'm sure oud have to order parts from France
Just to clarify something. The JZS171 Crown, Only the Athlete V came with the "276hp" 1JZGTE. The regular Athlete had the NA 1JZ. Only 15,000 Athlete V's were built. 10k Sedans and 5k wagons. There is also an Athlete VX with 300hp. But those are rare with only 300 built.
Please, make videos 'bout cars man ;)
Thanks James!  I LOVE YOU!!!🥰
Seat Ibiza channel build? Here you can make a diesel rocket easily for cheap and the car itself is dirt cheap.
I had an S3 8L it was the best car I have ever owned RIP my wonderful pocket rocket.
I thought the Gita was AWD? Or was the AWD only AT??
Just watch what old school top gear said about the Tuscan before you even think about touching them 😂
The clio v6 NA sound is so satisfying
I was born in 2003, I got kinda lucky that most of my dream cars we already available in the U.S. but can I afford a Mercedes C63 AMG Black Series? No the answer is no I can't *but* I can afford to eat healthy and exercise so when I do finally have the money for that AMG I'm all light weight and strong so I can wheel it around the track more effectively
Ah so this where you went 😮 subbed bro
Smooth 😂👌🤙💯
The early 2000s was the best era for cars. Anything after 2010 I hate.
You put a picture of Seat Ibiza which was based on the Polo platform, smaller than Golf. Seat Leon shared the Golf/A3 chassis
Yo da man shouts from the ville!
Hell yeah. I said to myself when I saw the thumbnail "is that a Clio sport like from Grand turismo?" Loved that car in silver
You the missed how the Tuscan got madder still... When they bolted two of the inline 6's together and nailed the V12 into their Cerbera to create the 'SPEED 12'. A car so mad that even TVR didn't want to make a full production run of them... Hell, they DE-tuned the engine so it could try and pass regulations to run in the GT1 series (They changed the rules so it couldn't compete).
Can already tell that 12 is a tvr Tuscan
Do we have to smog these in Cali?
Ford TS50! How did it not make the list. Another great Ausie car!
Imagine owning a media company and allowing THE James Pumphrey to walk.
Regarding the Clio mkII - even the base models were fun little shopping carts. You could get them cocking a leg so easily and the lift-off oversteer was phenomenal (And that's before we get into the mad Renault Williams Clio... Williams as in the F1 team. They went full ham on Clio's for a while before the V6)
On the flipside - someone in the UK imported a Cybertruck... it's been impounded and will be crushed for being illegal over here. Good times.
James went from telling us about his dad to becoming all of our dads! much love dude
My dream car 1:19
I own the RS172 and been thinking I don't think you have them and mines almost 25 years old so not long till they can be imported!
I LOVE the Clio v6, I want one sooo fuckin baaaaaaaaaad. Absolutely ZERO trunk space but dammit idc
Everyone says “Pray for LA”   I say I’m not going to question Gods will
No way my man forgot about Opel Corsa B 2000 edition
Bro just said his fiance weighs 2,000 pounds 💀
The GT-R is stupid expensive here a list of affordable cars and a $5 million pagani….. you okay bro?
8:31 didn’t the US market B5 s4 come with a v8?
Oh but there ARE forbidden fruit my friends, because China's getting into the car game and some of what they're making, I want. I want it bad. It's INSANE. Also, they have parts factories cranking out replacement parts for 90's JDM already, it's only a matter of time until someone goes "But what if I put them together here? They look really cool"   Keep calm, and import a BYD Yangwang
this video may be the reason i go into financial debt
Your showing the look of a Phase 2 model and quoting the horse power they are much more expensive NA for a few more years and much more expensive. But I get your message.
fun list !
the seat cupra is not a mark4 with a strange body,its the same car as a vw polo from 1994 till 2002 :O
Saturn Sky redline GXP  and Pontiac Solstice redline is opel speedster
3:03 I never thought I would like or think a French car is cool until now ok now I want one 😂
It was the last great era . When you could drive a car hard , an had an actual throttle cable. 🍻👊🏼
Damn man, how did a top 15 car list make me get emotional about changing times. Killer video and vibe man.
The Clio V6 had the same brakes as the regular Clio, it was nicknamed "The Widowmaker" cause it was so dangerous, if you do get this car, get some Brembos man
If I had 250k you bet I would get an R34 GTR right now
SOo I was like why does Matt from Matts off road Recovery look familiar? Then it hit me he looks like you in a big ol bushy beard. weird right? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsoTKiHqsWM
Great videooooo 🎉🎉🎉
21:40 word
Damn! Belgians doing cars in 2000? 😂
The TVR made an appearance in the movie Swordfish
That shirt fuckin rocks
Can you do a video over the Toyota 2zzge? Sleeper inside the Toyota  XRS, Matrix, VIBE GT, Celica GTS, Corolla T Sport, lotus Elise? 🎉🎉🎉
Would love a RS4 Avant. Love Euro hot wagons, shame they didn’t get any traction in the US.
man your love and passion and gratitude are shining so bright. i am happy for you, you're living!!!!
crazy seeing yourself in a youtube video i owned the blue s15 vert. and was driving it in the short clip; haha
hahaha.. the flag of belgium instead off the german one m8.  pretty sloppy
15:15 It always surprises me that the same Americans who laud the 2000s Mark II/X and Crowns, shit on the Lexus IS and GS which were built on the exact same platform with the same engines available as options. They draw inaccurate comparisons with the German counterparts and noone ever bought em lol. Sad that we don't know what we really want even if it's available right under our noses.
how does this guy end every video with a deep thought that actually gets to you. These videos are too high quality for modern entertainment.
RHD Cars are expensive to insure FYI.
Ford falcon never gets mentioned
Convertible s15s are ugly
Sign off on this video just hit me super hard, ,weird times for sure, hope you are doing well James!  Can't agree more, globalization is definitely making things lack the cultural variation that made them so unique and interesting. I do hope we get back to some specialization in some more industries rather than just everything being the same all over the world soon!
I knew the s15 would be on here 🥲
There are still going to be cars to cover. Like starting in 2006 the Mondeo ST estate. That's the car I'm waiting for, the ultimate dad car.
For next year: Nissan stagea m35... A 350z wagon 🤩
I would prefer a Second Generation Seat Ibiza CUPRA 2.0 16v, and go full kit car madness
It's not even funny how that last part resonates with me. So true. I guess we are getting old. 😂
Got the flags wrong, mixed up Germany and Belgium...That is quite poor, but but fits very well the stereotype of murica knowing jack squat about other countries
Cool list!
We really should do what the French did way back when! I can honestly say I have a car from grandturismo, but I would trade a whole lot of what I have for an R34!
11:50 Pumphrey just pretty much explained VW’s MQB architecture and the idea of One Ford.
11:37 Everytime I visit Mexico I always see seat cupras SUV they're soooo nice cooler version of the Tiguan
VW  for the win!!!!!!
That gen of Audi s3 is so common for young drivers and guys in their 20s in the UK and the are modded and tuned to the max they are so cool and cheap here.
Let’s be honest. Gran Turismo is the reason most of us are aware of most car that we don’t see in our regular lives. I still want a Nissan Stagea, but not enough to deal with the hassle of importing one.
The story behind pagani is actually so fucking sick lol
❤content
Wait James had a heart attack?
The ending of this turned into a uncle in his cozy chair just chatting away in the evening. Love it.
James... we love you. Glad you're healthy. And the bike! Ride that joker. If you see this.... pop a wheelie. Thanks for the entertaining content!
test
Hah Belgium))
Bro taking about buying imports while I can barely afford a Toyota in the states and can't afford my own place
Its wild to me that almost everything is 3, but a Renault is a 5 😂To be honest, if I were to move to the States, i would definitely import a Clio 182 for a track car and maybe even a couple more for parts and for a daily.
Un plaisir messieurs 🇫🇷
COBALT SS MENTIONED🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
We love you too buddy thank you for making videos
I knew of the opio speedster form need for speed hot purist 2. It so cool to here its name.
I was wondering why the belgian flag at the  beginning, and when I saw the first one I remembered this is an american channel.
you’ve still got the clio rs and megane rs  audi rs3 to name a few
Great video, cool cars, thanks. And yes, your right the homogenization of the world via corporations, internet and tv has made the world less interesting, not just for cars. Your an interesting  person, thanks again.
the video is crap when the best car on the list is a renault clio
Bruh that last part hit hard 😢
If you want a smaller UTE import a Latin American Chevy Montana
Very strong message in the last minute of the video!!!!
You forgot to say the TVR will kill you
Stroking it to the RS4 rn
Clio 172 is a good shout for those who don’t have v6 money!
love ya James
im from curacao a island in the dutch caribbean and we can bring a shit ton of japanese cars,( my first car was a K car) and the gita its our g35, all my friends have them and mod them,  amazing machine, the ones 2jz in them 🥹😣
Amazing Video. Keep up the great work
It's weird watching this from the UK thinking you never had that?!
That Vauxhall throws me back to NFS Hot Pursuit 2
Most new cars suck now.  I feel what you're saying in this video James.  Garage is my stockpile.  Evo IX, Evo X, E36M3, 02 337 GTi, and a S2000 stashed away for end of times.  All shitboxes, but they're my shitboxes!
Belgium flag is ww2 joke i think
It is not "say-ott" is it "seet".
The 2000 Subaru WRX STi should be on this list 💯
James, I love you dude but your killing me, do you know that every single one of these cars has gone up in value since this video 😩🤣
Allot of these cars are drram cars for anyone who played Grand Turismo or Forza, or who watched top gear (the original show). It's crazy to me how now we're just in a homologation of life w cars. It's all seemingly just regurgitated stuff w a different exterior. And that's partially why electric vehicles suck. Cool video, thanks for making/sharing 🏁
These videos make me appreciate living in europe lol. Love the content James, keep it up
Thx god Pagani Zonda finally got legal here. Let me go ahead and buy one for me and one for my brother now that we can
SEAT cupra 4 all day long, planning on importing one this year
10:50 anyone remember that fool with the imported A3 or S3 in the early 2000's at waterfest (was it waterfest?? I can't remember, that was so long ago)? lol
Damn Belgian cars are dope 😂
I love hanging out in the garage with you, James.
Using the donut mic with a little tape over it is hilarious. I haven’t even watched the whole video yet and I love it.
You are killing it James. Love the content.
I'm not sure, but was the Opel Omega V6 from the 90s? Cause if it's also a 2000 model, that thing is fire
ummm.........You forgot one that is very niche, but for the people that know it rocks thier socks. The Audi A2 van.
You could always import the holden cars. Even newer ones
not me about to watch a video about importable cars when i know damn well i cant afford to be importing any cars....lol
If you are Canadian and interested there are currently two 2004 Renault Clio V6 rear engine Manual transmission for sale in Saudi Arabia I said that because I know that in Canada you can import cars that are 15 years old or older. Share me email if you're interested to share you photos
I had no idea they made a s15 convertible! definitely a car i would love to see in person.
Does Belgium ever made any cars?? WTF??
Everything now is the same and that is just a reflection of capitalism, which is odd enough if you think that is what communism was accused of lol. But yeah, it is sad that the best stuff humans created are mostly behind us, hopefully we overcome capitalism one day and start creating again
we should do that, by the way
So many hatchbacks on the list that I'm starting to want one, Golf R32 here I come.
I feel like this whole list was my childhood Grand Tourismo garage lol
God, I fucking love James. the true life blood of Donut that got me back into the car scene after a few years away. The transition to this solo content has been awesome to watch and I love the retrospective at the end. Somber reality that the personality has left all of our formerly romantic industries
Beligians not only make frites🍟and waffles 🧇, but also lots of cars 😂
Audi IS German Not belgian so why u used the belgian falg for all the German Cars?
Cars now are trying so hard to be appliances that do all things equally.  There can't be any character when they are all trying to do the same thing the same way.
I had a A6 with that 2.7t and it was great, when worked, which was never.
4:50 has the Belgium flag instead of the German flag
I've driven a Clio V6... and let me tell you, it is TERRIFYING. You'd think mid-engine=nice weight balance and nice handling, right? Wrong! Imagine a Viper, that is hatchback shaped, and wants to kill you more than a TVR Chimaera.
Sounds like you’re getting old and romantic: “They just don’t make them like they used to”.
100% certain that the Belgium flag was put there on purpose to boost engagement in the comments
Bro is describing the bankrupt Balkan car scene
these cars are gonna go extinct if USA will put its greasy hands on them. what a waste.
RS4 wagon is the dream
Before I watch this video I want to acknowledge just how much I love this guy.
Love this video, love the direction of the channel. Fun fact you can import some of these cars from Mexico, don’t even have to be imported overseas. Keep the SPEEED up! 💪🏻
bro forgot u omni from India
In the uk the 8L AUDI S3 was everywhere in the 2000's. They're all ragged to death, and they're all council estate drug dealer cars
I need a up to speeed on Pokémon and everything 80s 90s doing fucking Heelys be James
I need, NEEEEED an E46 Touring. Desperately
‏‪10:18‬‏  shotout to our VAG BOI  the 8L S3 was my 1st car, my 2nd was a mk4 golf gti with the 1.8L 20vt
SPAIN MENTIONED 🗣🗣🗣🗣 🇪🇸 🇪🇸 🇪🇸 🇪🇸
James you have reinvigorated my love for Audi with the avant info… though the Clio and the Lupo are there too. I’m glad you’re back at it and keeping it James it’s a breath of fresh air.
i agree with you, but the Toyota GT 86 and the Honda Type R hatchback 2015 are two of the last real japanese sportscars that still feel oldschool to drive. not alot of electronics, but all the fun. i'm a proud owner of a Type R 2015 and i couldn't be happier.
Damn Sweden only made it to the nerd list….
Germany is different from Belgium.... Just sayin
New vid yeaaaah buddy
We love you james!
Love you too James! While not as cool as your list... 4 of my 5 cars are 2000 or earlier.  Change can be a drag... I get it. Keep up the cool videos ❤
aren't the audi's and VW german cars?
Just wait until you can import the Honda Civic Type R FN2 from 2007.
An engine swapped Lupo GTI seems like a good idea...
What's with the Donut mic?
james, not sure if you knew but scotto already has an a3 here in the states that you should buy!
big fan of this channel and the typa content you make
I been waiting for the Opel Speedster and its other companion the Vauxhall version of it.
Nice!
Does  Gordon gecko know you dressed in his house in 84 going by the sweater 😂😂
I have an 80s Renault 5 and really like the brand because of that model. To me, the Renault 5 and the Renault 5 turbo are cool as hell, but the clio v6 simply doesnt look as good.
loving the clio v6 since it was born, have seen it twice, once in Helsinki and 10 years ago in Berlin. amazing in real life
Anyone else worried about James? He’s a shell of his former self, low energy, mentions death. I can’t imagine how leaving donut impacted you James, but you’re worth it man. You made that channel. Make this one.
SEAT is cool
what is the brand of the chair that you are sitting in?
Good idea making a van list of the coolest vans
Fell in love with the Renault Clio V6 from Need for Speed Most Wanted
Donut did it first
Bro u took the Belgium flag and not Germany 🥲
As a french dude, I can tell you, the clio is terrifying, the front wheels do not turn that much and it make the car really hard to save from slide on the road because of the weight of the v6 positionned in the back of the chassis
TL;DR - what happened to the bookshelf?   I’m loving all the videos, but what happened to the format that the Carhartt and Stüssy videos followed? I low key kinda miss the “ingredient” label at the start of the video.
Is that a pair of Schmidt wheels in the back? ❤
The land of the free yet they couldn't import a Renault Clio V6 until now?
I think that the Internet could be responsible for cars and other things in culture to meld together. We went from having a million different cultures all over the world, but now that we all interact together regardless of borders, we influence each other, and culture has sort of melded together. Yee yee Americans are less common, British blokes are less common, kinky Germans are less common, outraged French are still common but we will probably see them peter out too.
Hey Speeed team! Miss ya guys! hope you guys are doing ok. Stay safe, keep doin what ya love, cuz I love it!
The idea that Tekken is dying is crazy, T8 has like a thousand more average daily players than T7 did at the end of its life. Last year's TWT events broke records for attendance almost across the board. A lot of that growth is because there are so many top quality content creators like you helping people learn and enjoy the game. The online Tekken community is just the whiniest bunch of doomer babies in the FGC. If you listen to them you would think the game is completely broken and unbalanced and no one has any fun playing it ever. All these complainers should be cyberbullied until they delete their Reddit accounts.
that pagani story is a fkn movie lol
The Clio V6 is absolutely 10/10.  So, so, so cool.
James- the ending was very philosophical- deep stuff my dude
Deep but true ending... W
5:15 the TDI makes more than that!!!
Most of these cars have been in the Bahamas for years that crazy
When I see the Opal Speedster and the Vauxhall VX220 I think of Need for speed Hot pursuit 2. My childhood just peed
Not the Donut microphone
S15 Varietta looks good? You’re absolutely lying or it could be your opinion which I respect, maybe
In 2 years you guys will be able to import barra powered cars
Ah volkswagen,             de automobiel 🇧🇪
The altezza wagon never came with the 4 cylinder only a 2litre and 3 litre 6
“This seems like a fun way to die” – James, 2025
the TVR Swordfish car! only John Travolta could have it and look normal with it
well im from denmark and i see most of these cars every day but cool to see some people appreciate them
The Klein bike in the background reminds me of Seinfeld and I dig it.  Also if you don’t ride it send it my way.
own a clio v6 with 30,000 miles, rhd ! I predict they'll go up to $100,000. Only 3000 ever made and quite a few are wrecked already.
A swedish car you can import , SAAB 9.3 cab 2.3 L 230 HP . The company no longer exist , but it's stil a very good car !!!
03:01 and from Most Wanted too :D
I really want an 8L S3, basically a bigger Audi TT Quattro of the same year....kinda like how the S3 and the TTS are still the same....
B5 is still my dream car
Much love man, I love the vibe of your new videos.
The Holden HSV is basically a Opel/Vauxhall Omega with a big engine 😮
Cars that we can finally import but can no longer afford 😢
The first time I saw the Belgium flag threw me off, then I knew you f***** up ! 😂
I already know that Clio will cost at least 50 grand
No wonder some american put the belgium flag as germany :DD
So as a person who works the automotive parts section in a higher capacity, please be careful importing your cars. There are so few places that actually carry your parts in north America it's actually kind of ridiculous. The amount of right hand drive vehicles I've had to send away because the layout of the engine is different and the parts don't line up is wild.  Tldr  Awesome cars, hard to find parts for them in NA
It's always funny hearing Americans pronounce Renault.
I definitely want the Renault Clio V6 , i first seen that car yrs ago on Xbox when I bought Sega gt 2002 , where you can track race and drag race against any car in the game......... it's def a car that I want to buy if there wasn't any other fees on top of the shipping cost which would end up costing more than 10k
Globalism is real
Aint no way bro put on a Pagani zonda and the word affordable on the video
One day car youtubers will stop driving up the price of ALL the cool cars us normies would love to buy but now can't...............AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!! Love you james but also f*ck you at the same time!!!!!!!!🖕🤣🖕
Having the Belgian flag represent Germany is a massively avoidable cock-up. Anyway, I think the Toyota Origin is a product of bringing retro design language into the modern world, like the PT cruiser tried.
18:57 Too bad, every car guy should try a motorcycle. I love mine! It could be something slower, not a pocket rocket. It’s just a different kind of experience 🎉
I’d love to see the top Japan Kei cars. There are a lot of cool little nuggets in that category
7:28
Germany - shows Belgian Flag. I hate it.
So, the Pagani Zonda was already pure unobtanium...now it's legal to bring into the USA.  That's no longer a dream car...its a fantasy one 😭😭😭
Opel Speedster was my favorite starting car in Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2, from 2002
Great, content that's only applicable to Americans👏🏾☺️
Ofc it's an American show they don't know Belgium and Germany flag 😂😂😂
Usually the SEAT setups are more livelier than the VW or Audi models as they are tuned for B roads and not for the autobahns. I would wait for the Leon Cupra to be available that thing to me is cooler than than mk IV golf
Ideal showed up on my feed last night for some reason, he hd a pink mic... My ol lady thought it was a dildo idk y they use these funny colored mics 😂
I saw Belgians flags so I expected a bunch of Minerva's
I unsubscribed from donut for whatever that’s worth, but more importantly I like your new channel better, you were mostly the reason I watched donut anyway, I subscribed  to a couple of the other guys too
I'm not a fashionista or anything, but you can pretty much picture two different people, one dressed in 2000 garb and hairstyle, and the other dressed in today's clothing and hairstyle, and it would be hard to tell what era each one was from. Creativity is stagnant. 'Everything's already been done', people say. I think this, and the creativity issues with automakers, is closely related. IMHO
I used to have a poverty spec Lupo as a teen. I always wanted a GTi but even back then they were like unicorns. I think they sold less than 1000 sold in the UK and all the ones I saw had been ruined by shitty mods.
Meanwhile the Clio v6 is 100k in Aus.....
holden maloo 2000
Next year the Renault Aventime v6 will be avaiable for you in usa, you look like someone who'll like a van in 2 Doors 😂
I guess the FD2 and Accord Euro R gonna be very... lets wait hahahah
The 182 and 172 Clio are cool and a lot cheaper.
Two things I have to say:  Belgium Germany
I’m sad to see all these cool cars I can’t have. And super sad to learn that the year 2000 was 25 years ago
When I first moved to Italy, I had a Clio diesel as a rental for the first few months. Great gas mileage, but it was a turd. Now I'm sitting here actually considering importing that V6 Clio. Lol
The german flag is wrong  but very fun video
All them hatchbacks at 4.9 and the Toyota Origin at 5, I need it.
Since when are our german VWs and Audis from Belgium?? What Intern is to blame here? We (ze Germans) are demanding a name, while we start lighting our torches!
I had to stop and pause at the mini coopers side by side it looks insane the size difference
ARGENTINA MENTIONED WTF IS NO TOMAR MATE
Always a good day when we got a new video!💚
Guys please. Do you even know Germany exists ? Hahaha
TVR does stand for TreVoR
So it's to murder people now? Man, left has gotten a hold of you strong.
2:18 thats okay, I'll say it.
10:55 that's exactly what it is (Golf MK4)
I know the Clio from Need for Speed Most Wanted(2005). One of the greatest NFS.
"The coolest thing France has done since it started chopping the heads off of rich people..."🤣 Best. Based.
Import a gen 3 jimny
Hold on, didn't the Top Secret GT500 Supra have an RB26DETT?
Hey James  Gotta correct you there Buddy... The Ibiza is based on the VW Polo...  You mean the Seat Leon And the equivalent to the Bora / Jetta there is the SEAT Toledo  And what is also slept on is the Skoda Octavia RS mk1  which is a sleeper Mk4 Golf Wagon in a boring look als available as a Sedan... So there are even more options available
This channel has reawakened my dormant love for old European cars. However, how does one go about getting parts for old cars that are rare in the US. Love the idea of importing one of these, but how do I maintain it?
too much ads dude...
I start to panic when the cars over here become legal to import in the US. All of a sudden all the cheaper fun cars becone collectible and expensive. That last statement hit me in the feels a bit, and made me reflect on how i havent genuinely been exited about a new car in ages.
Holden looks like 4 door gto
A well kept Clio V6 costs about 65K€ in Europe. So much for affordable.
I live in germany and i know all of these and why did you put belgium flags into german cars?
This is why modern cars suck they are all the same..so many cool cars from the late 80s 90s 2000-03 lol. Man I wish I could import a classic car
Pretty sure “That guy” is Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin 😂
8:56 leg cross
10:59 this one is definitely sick!
Clio is rad af always hoped one day to get one. Ten years from now I'll get a junkyard after someone lets off gas in a corner
Tariffs are going to put a huge kink in this plan
Great show. Up here in Canada, we only have to wait 20 years to import.
Yeah, there's no character
11:31 My first car! Crazy cheap here, like 3k euro. With a tune makes 200hp on 1100 kg, really fun and quite fast!!! 1.8T are crazy tunable engines, really good stuff
Belgium 🇧🇪…. German 🇩🇪
Toms Aristo is available. 200 made per model year, 2jz gte 4 seats as close to a 4 door supra as you can get.
The TVR Tuscan is basically a British 1st gen Dodge Viper. It's got way too much power for the traction it has, no safety systems, and is nigh on undrivable at speed.....also it's cool as fuck.  Also, affordable cars you can import. First car: Skyline GTR R-34 But if you CAN'T afford that: Pagani Zonda Killing me here James lol
13:34 Someone probably already pointed it outThe top secret supra had the V-12 1GZ-FE, not the 3S-GTE
TO ALL KENT ICANS i hope your happy now. I am mostly trump is a helluva guy. But the things he says on busniess and greenland are red cards.   Tesla not only sells its wares on mass in Europe but BUT... Tesla also swallows govt subsidiaries around the world taking money from govts to supply jobs.   Yet those American companies pay the land back with hostile take overs. Factory closures then when its sucked dry. The usa company moves to germany 😢  Ford moved into UK and destroyed the British car market. The transit van by itself ended badges. Ford escort which Ford copied a mazda design for the mk3 or 4 going FWD . I had no idea the sly dogs. I thought escort was English as transit van as sierra. But nope. Ford used btitain until rover closed the last rival then ford moved to germsny where GM was obviously struggling having only brought out Opel Vauxhall 😢  Ford closed factories. Brought out land rover. Jaguar merged them into one stole their home work then sold them to India 😢   Then ford brought aston martin and gutted them too. Today fords still wear their aston masks 😢  Yet trump talk like usa doesnt do busniess in Europe?    Usa is sucking europe dry and people are just realising it. Usa company revenues are going down but the people funnel their money to china now instead. Dressing their kids in flammable dangerously made chemical content clothes. Or plastics made with materials long banned here. Your kids bite toys and you buy them from temu 😢😮  This will be a fun year tho. Watching American freedom taken away. You want imports TOUGH youll buy home made like russia 😢😢
Try to not mess up the german flag .... it's not Belgium! ☺👀
instead of the Audi S3, you can buy either the same gen Seat Leon Cupra (1.8T) or even next gen Seat Leon Cupra (2.0T)
12:30 you forgot about the GR Yaris and the Lotus Elise Sport Cup, the latter of which we have to wait another 17 years for
5:00 why not get the more modern VW Up! GTI ? Same car, but newer
Clio is my dream car next to the Mits Gto/3000gt
I spent the whole intro wondering... WHAT BELGIAN CARS DO THEY HAVE IN THAT LIST???
Honestly I’m VERY glad I came across this video. It gave me an idea. I got pretty messed up in a motorcycle accident and will have limited range of motion in my right knee. Ive been able to get in the passenger seat of cars and trucks but i haven’t tried a driver side yet (still recovering and need 3 ligaments put back together). I hadn’t thought about the solution if that’s too difficult although now I’m thinking a rhd car might be something I end up having to look into
8:09  i even but a 2025 hotweels
11:29 NO WAY IBIZA!
Did you get the C6 RS6 in the US from release?
You used the flag of Belgium instead of Germany. It doesn't matter anyway, I'm just saying.
I live in the UK so I'm quite lucky to see most of these cars at shows and stuff. TVR have always been a favourite of mine, i really want one but prices are always just a little too far away for me to get to. Also my mum and step dad used to have a Noble M12 GTO 3R. It was great fun when it worked.
is there anyone who has imported Alfa Romeo GTVs in the US? it is a very cool car but i imagine hard to maintain there
Fun fact: All 6 cylinder powered TVRs were the most powerful naturally aspirated inline 6 engines ever made till this day
You can import a Honda ATR (year 98-02), it has 2.2 v-tec H22A7. The bigger brother of the civic type R
Love you bro! Thank you
How could u not be a fan of convertibles.... They all leak in the rain and certain deaths in flipping lol
Putting a Belgian flag instead of a German one os the most American thing on this video. And its a video about cars made by an american
Is this channel still affiliated with Doughnut, or did you just steeel that microphone on the way out 😂
Most of the cars mentioned here, we got in South Africa since new 😅😅
If you like the holden commodore check out the opel omega (the commodore was based on it) with a 3.2 v6 or a 2.6 v6 or inline six bmw diesels.
Scotsman here. Stay away from those clio v6's. Slow as a week in the jail and break easier than lego does.
This is awesomeness
I don't care how dangerous, i wanna Lada neiva!! 30mpg 4wd!!!
WE LOVE YOU JAMES.  Never give up on your craft
Pls make a Camera episode
You heard him, everyone buy a Zonda
#15 ftw.
The reason for selling it as a kit car, was probably to evade taxes. Caterham Super 7 was built as a kit car, so customers could avoid MOT Taxes.
#3 is a Saturn Sky no?
The Holden ute has been legal to import. Although not sold in the USA, it was originally intended to be sold there. It passes all legal requirements and can be converted to left hand drive.
One more, 2007-2011 Honda Civic TypeR (hatchback FN2).
I think the Zonda is the most beautiful car of all time.
This Belgium/Germany flag stupidly reminds me the stupid Turks. They confused the Russian, Dutch and France flags with eachother 😂
Man, c'mon Belgian flag by the Lupo GTI?!
First car reminds me of a R8 for some reason
I owned an 8L S3 followed by a Nogaro Blue B5 RS4 - glad to see them on the list. The S3 was great, very solid, well built, great interior and very quick in all weather with a few simple mods. The RS4 was the same but MOAR, loved that car so much, tuned to 440 vascular shireponies it would beat a 996 Turbo in a straight line... loved to understeer in the wet though, even with the best tyres, Bilstein coilovers and uprated ARBs. I used to commute in the RS4 and regularly see a Clio V6 in the same traffic - knowing nods were exchanged between me and the Clio driver. Oh, and my friend's brother had a Tuscan Speeed Six - phenomenal looks and performance but was always broken.
You know you American  win you don't rhe right  flag of Germany  amd you put a belgium  flag
big love bro <3
zbeeep
zpeeeeeed
Wana try the FWD ph1 172 as well they came out in 1999 had nearly 200 bhp weight is 1000kg handles better than the RWD all day
Never has a video reached through my screen and slapped me in the face and said "Hey shithead, I'm talking to YOU" until the comment about watching CKY DVD's and Bam's S4.
HILUX
I have a 2000 mitsubishi galant v6sport that turns 25 this year for sale ireland
Mistaken the German flag with Belgium flag it's kind of cute
As a French, you have the feeling totally right. Because impossible is not french so why the fuck not? 😂 beside that, the car is absolutely terrifying to drive, that's litteraly a coffin on wheels, steering is so light when you go on gas that you might end going straight in the canyon if you're not aware. More than one ended up in lakes tho.
Love the new show! Keep up the good work! How about the renault laguna coupé, avantime, espace F1. Or maybe you could do a segment about the crazy history of Louis Renault and renault it self, there is a lot there even till modern day with carlos ghosn
Importing a staria van from japan is a massive W
How is the Noble so cheap, it would be a dream to own a noble
I got a S3 8L and its really slept on.
Comment below me your favorite pre 2000s car! I want suggestions!
Fiat Punto Mk 2 Abarth,Alfa Romeo 147/159 with 2.5 v6 Bismo engine....
YEEEES THE AUDI S3 8L FINALLY GETS SOME ATTENTION!!!!
Imagine of all these cars you can also import a European Ford Fiesta Zetec S from 2000, this is a 900KG (1984.16LBS) car with around 106HP from a 1.6 Ford Focus engine. And the mechanical parts should be already in the US, and its freaking unique, already getting scarce in Europe. Best part they go for like 1000 to 1500 US
Belgium the new Germany
Sorry but it seems that you put Belgium flag on all German Cars. Which is close but not good. 😛 There is no more Belgium cars... perhaps the Vertigo is still available ?
Wow, this dude hit the Ozempic hard.
Please tell me the "German" Flag was a joke xD
Thanks for the Belgium shout-out brother 🤝
Hands off our Clio V6's, they are already so rare over here and I'm still saving for mine!
I had a VW Bora and it had a strange w5 engine. was an absolute mission to work on
Why is this video in german??
15:49 😳 OMG.  Much need.
Clios are amazing in RS trim as well.
Bro has aged
they're all old and the mileage will be very high, no one stupid enough to waste that kind of money
Why do I keep expecting to hear "LIGHTNING LIGHTNING LIGHTNING"⚡⚡⚡
VW LUPO MENTIONED!!!! I have 2 and im from the Uk, its such a wicked car and I recommend them to anyone, its very cheap too
I didn't know what to expect when you made your own channel.  But I love your content. I hope you are happy with where you are in life.  We all love you
Hi James, I love your videos... fun, smart, honest and genuine. As a French guy working at Renault, I appreciate that you mentioned the Clio V6... we are now working on a new crazy toy : the Renault 5 Turbo 3E, to be revealed shortly!
If you cant get the clio v6, get the sport or the williams. Safer and useful
oh i knew it belgium was invading poland and building cars  or maybe  just maybe the guy who made the grafics is a idiot and didnt finish first grade
Why has the Belgium flag 🇧🇪 been used instead of the German one 🇩🇪. 😂  Americans: …..
Heads up Holdens are no longer made in Australia and they are worth a insane amount of money now
Omg I have a VW Lupo as my first car!! It was mint 😂😂😂
the rs4 wagon looks nice
Emm, sorry for being geeky, but at #6 it says jzx110 implies mark II , but on the chart is actually an icon of toyota crown - different car, its bigger and also could be equipped with turbo 1  jz btw 🤓
Im so envious you can get some of these rad cars for 30 grand  That Renault Clio v6 here is at a minimum of 50 grand
Fernando Alonso is from my region, remember him driving the Clio V6, the coolest car ever.
Just bought a Clio V6 and a week later this video affirms my purchase, import laws are still confusing and hopefully i can actually get it off the boat.
The Altezza Gita was sold as the Lexus IS200 and IS300 "Sport Cross" in Germany. So if you want a LHD version get one from Europe
James is such a VAG fanboy and he cant hide it
Ibiza is not Leon
Shhhhh bro.....  Cmon. You're gonna drive up prices!
Car content a hit ✌️..
hey James i own a Toyota Mark X 300G premium and i'd like you to tell people  about it too        (i am not from US)
Thanks for this great video i love this kind of video’s. A bit of feedback check your flags!😂
Maybe it's a good idea to import cars that are close to 25 years old but not yet there. Store them in Canada and register them when they are old enough. A lot of the cool stuff is getting very expensive as soon as you guys can import it. Options: Alfa Romeo 147 or 156 GTA(2002) (You can get an early 156 2.5 busso v6 already) Seat Leon Cupra R (2002) Ford Focus RS (MK1) 2002 RS6 C5 avant (2002) Alpina B10 V8s touring (2002) Mercedes C55 AMG combi (2004) MG ZT260 (2004)
04:50 why is there a flag of Belgium and not Germany on the VW Lupo GTI?
I have to tell you James i really wonder since when is Vw and Audi a belgium car maker. maybe u can change the flag to the correct one.
60$ to deliver a T-shirt to Australia is so rough, cause I wanted that shirt too
Bought my first car in 2013, Yellow Audi S3 8L with 9 spokes and a stage 1 tune haha. I loved that car and miss it to this day. Absolutely get one James!
oh no, these are gonna become overpriced like jdm cars lmao
One of the craziest things renault made was Espace F1.
Yeah man, we’re definitely the target market for panganis😂
I’ve loved that Renault Clio sport since og Forza. That was my favorite car when I was like 10
Seat ibiza is not on golf mk4 platform.Seat leon is.
Why have you used the flag of Belgium for German cars? Unless these are special Belgium only editions, that makes them rare even in Europe.
Great video.  YouTube kept stopping for ads every 93 seconds throughout the video.  Lol.
Who would win: The ignorance of an American or an 0,5s google search?  Belgian VW apparently....
The Opel Speedster was the Saturn Sky Redline or Pontiac Solstice GXP before the Saturn Sky Redline or Pontiac Solstice GXP.
MAAAAAN LUPO's are so sweet
I’ve been sad lately that new cars have no personality, are ugly and too expensive with all the new tech and luxury. We lived in the last good car era.
I'm not importing any. Caus I'm in the UK. And broke.
My Favorite always was The Mazda 323 GTR
Behold! Dumb Americans about to increase some car prices.
I’ve loved that Renault Clio sport since og Forza. That was my favorite car when I was like 10
8:45 song?
Smart roadster soon!!
Renault. Lift off oversteer as standard 😂
America, ruining used car prices for everyone else in the world once again.
Yo James!! (Sir James cuz I’m idk 20 years more younger) can you make a vid about small mid/rear engine cars like the Opel and the MR2 Spyder? That would be great! Oh yeah, it needs to be cheap, cuz u know the economy man
5 th back to back rocket money add on different channels wtf?
Thanks James ❤
Wasn't expecting The Feels!
11:45   I love this man for his love of VW.  I started this video fully believing two things  1. The 1.8t mo powa baby engine would make an appearance in the lists and  2. VW 4motion is getting mentioned.   Good to know my intuition was correct
Don't like hatchbacks or wagons.
Hear me out, blown up Clio but you buy it for the shell and supercharge Kswap it.
Hell yeah! Car videos suit you the best James
Great video and I love the sign off message. On point.
2 more years and you get the legendary barra
YES JAMES! Speeed videos clunching their style rudebuoy! Loving this video/animation journey shindig your dragging us through. Oooooozing some style, shim shammy smooth chamois supple selections finding your brand. Always knew you'd get there🤩
The end of this video. Losing the Romance. I fealt that. Even as a youtuber. Like how do i even compete when every video is 1 dollar truck vs million dollar truck!
This is a nice list, more of this yearly 😊
UP THE FUCKEN VX CLUBBY
Too many commercial interruptions! Fix the settings!
Loving these new list videos, James! It's so cool to see some love being shown to some classics of the UK car scene. I used to own an A3 8L (nothing compared to the S3 performance-wise), and I loved it to bits. They are so cool. I lowered it on 17" Audi TT wheels with 20mm spacers on the rear, and it sat so nicely. Blue Alcantara seats from the factory to match the denim blue paint, such a vibe. I'd highly recommend that any American VW/Audi lover import one.
I don't think the Altezza Gita came with the 4cyl beams, pretty sure it only had the 2jz w/auto or the 2.0l 6cyl w/auto or manual. cool vid!
Love you james
12:57 Something else went hard in 1999 too
Have you ever heard of an E90 BMW with a 3 Liter Diesel? I think those were not sold in the US. You could get them with an 6 Speed an XDrive. Or a VW Touareg V10 or even better a Audi Q7 V12. If it isn't obvious i like Diesel, haha.
Love the videos but way too many ads!
Dude you should roast viewer's rides. Miss those.
💖 JDM MPVs 💖
Two more years and XR6 Turbos will be available for export/import to USA. Better buy em up before prices double overnight haha
The link for the discord server isn’t working for me. Is anyone else having problems with it?
rossion q1 was basically the american noble
great video! ❤‍🔥
Love the vid and there is some amazing info in there how ever I will add -  Jzx110 also came as a wagon  ( Blit ) also the 110 can come with a 2jzsfe , and the image of the white car is a crown 171 sedan on the list.  + what has already been said Altezza Gita can come awd  ( same as some crowns )  however they never released the Gita wagon with a 4cyl 3sge.  * owner of 171 wagon, Altezza  so that’s the reason for knowing the odd facts
Me watching this videos while I can't even buy the merch 😢
@anisadem c est pas toi a 7:17?
Speeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed
Thank you James!
All those Belgian cars are made in Germany FYI
Love the Klein in the background. 👌
James you changed a lot since 2018. Good for you
What happens when a coolant hose blows or a thermostat needs to be replaced, the car is down a week plus.. Get an old Dodge, Chevy or Ford and put a Holly Sniper on it!..🛻
Belgian flag, wrong Clio V6, Ibiza when I think you meant Leon, and confusing TVR with TWR. Come on man, it’s fun content but let’s do some fact checking before you upload
Top 25 cars that will be more expensive all over the world from now on.
7:50 James, you have to know, that this RS 4 Avant is legendary in Germany because it created one of the biggest german car memes when it completly annihilated a Porsche and it's cocky owner on the Autobahn. May I present to you: "Was is'n das für'n Kombi?"  (What kind of Station Wagon is that?") Enjoy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiuLvLobAs4
Vans are what the American truck scam killed off there. Just utterly bonkers that people with no businesses haul, tow or commute in a truck.
Altezza wagon only came with the 2J never the Beams
trevor AND rocketmoney mentioned???? trevor wallace collab soon?!?!?!
Perfectly put there at the end 21:50
Next episode: James learns flags.
PLEASE DO NOT TAKE OUR COMMYS AND FALCONS!
With the Schmidt Modern Lines in the background.  Nice 😏
Audi S3 🫶🫶🫶
I can vouch for thr Lupo and the S3. Still got the S3 and it's Imola Yellow. My Lupo was silver, too, haha.  Keep up the great work James and team.
What? No 206?? Damn
BRU U SHOULD SEE MY 3dr 2000    PAJERO SWB 🥹🥹
You mixed up the German with the Belgian flag!
adds every minute come on dude
That toyota Gita also came all wheel drive.  That's an all wheel drive 2J.
Wagonfest at petersen this year is boutta go CRAZY
If you put any more fucking ads in deleting this whole app ... An ad every 2 minutes is fucked up
2:56 you wont get one for 40 lol
"Now, cars are fast, but they're all kinda the same" YUP! and they're all 30%+ PLASTIC (can you tell i'm pissed by that... ROI and corporate interests sucks... for us)
I think I speak for everyone when I ask “where on earth are all the new sport sedans?”
Big love
Didn't Germany make all the cool cars, well done Belgium I guess
the Zonda wasn't legal here until this year???? ive seen like 3 on the road here in Connecticut, including the one that set the Nurburgring lap record a while back... (no kidding; google dreamride EXP photos / videos... one year it was the largest gathering of pagani's in North America or the world, and Horacio came and visited with his HP Barchetta)
Stay romantic and don't melt into everything else
WHAT IS THAT SWEATER xddddd
Huge warning: “The Dog Stars” by Heller is TERRIBLE
Tavarish got a Ute
The Renault Clio V6 - Good luck finding one of those to import.
The V6 Clio is one of my favorite cars from GT4.
I Love the fact the cars from 2000 are now legal while Also being Horrified that was 25 years ago WHAT HAPPEN and why do my knees hurt
Fk dude.  I miss Donuts.
James, always loved your content but pls exchange that 🇧🇪-flag with the right one 🇩🇪  😘
Loads of great machinery straight out of... Belgium.
Why are you guys using a Belgium flag for Germany? Lmao
make a part 2
Indians crying in the corner 😭😭😭 due to the import duty
The editing and graphics on this vid are world class... I almost feel guilty being able to watch it for free... hell yeah Speeed! <3
I love my 1999 Subaru Impreza L!
MK4 Bora TDI
We have most these cars here in our country and this video has made me appreciate them more
I did NOT expect this video to be as sentimental as it was😭😭
STOP!!!! MOST OF US ARE POOR, please don’t do this to us, the upper middle class is going to ruin this for us
never saw so many Belgium Cars in a Video nor knew that Belgium produced them... greetings from 🇩🇪 😂
James, I have a question, Is the Honda S660 coming to the USA?
Dude, check your flags. Using the beligian flag for Germany is a red flag!
If you have Pagani Zonda money, I'm fairly certain things like silly import laws weren't going to stop you from having one here at any time.
Just in case no one has mentioned it but that flag, is..... awesome. Love the show dude. Good luck finding a Clio V6. They’re like rocking horse shit.
The only thing America needs more of than more Renault Clio V6s is more Luigis
Let’s gooo Book Club here we go
I daily a 95 Crown Majesta with the  1uz-fe (non VVTI) I love this thang 🤍
this is dope I loe that goddamn hatchback
Wagons are hot
Finally car related stuff! Thanks!
Thoughts on the Volvo 850r?
It is very American to use a Belgian flag to show that a car has a German origin.
It's near impossible to do this in Cali right?
I can pull of a damn cane
James, your channel is doing good after leaving Donut Media
The Nissan S15 Varietta is cool
america really needs more hot hatches bro
Whats your favorite Belgian brand guys? Volkswagen or Audi?
Will More Holden's be imported soon to the USA?
You can buy the lupo for like 1500 - 3000
I'm glad the Pagani C12 is coming to the USA
The holden is a cadillac catera 🤔
Never stop making videos.
Hey man, I have a HUGE FAVOR. Please make a video on the Audi 8L S3! I want one now and have been researching how to get one in the States, but there is so much information online.  I would totally love it if you could share some wisdom on this topic!
That chair is a part of the show now.
I love you dude. I’m so stoked that you’re doing this channel. It’s everything that brought me to Donut in the first place (The Pumphey, mainly.)  Keep it up and I’ll keep supporting and singing your praises to my bros and sisses.
James, I love that you and your crew are making videos *you all* want to make. It’s easy to slip into the ‘what does the algorithm need??’ mindset, and by all means, there will be times where you need to make a few vids that have a big reach but only 1/2 the joy/effort, you gotta keep the lights on one way or another. But keep doing what you guys enjoy. x
Cky2k gang
Why am I’m getting so many adsssss
weird but exciting times my brother! keep up the gud work. much to be excited about!!!!
Don't import cars, save your money, and start learning how to invest in things that matter. You won't care about an imported car when you are 40.
Yesssss advocating for class consciousness 😈
Man I got 4 ad breaks in 5 minutes. I'm not watching this crap anymore
Thanks to Belgium for all the cool cars they have created  Greetings from Germany🇩🇪
One of my favorite nostalgia things about James Videos was when he was on Dount Media Channel. He talked about everything you need to know about the history of certain cars like the Chevy Monte Carlo
The clio RS is actually my dream car pls stop talking about it 🤍
No timestamps?!
Germany 🇩🇪
7 ads in 5 mins? Had to click out.
weird 2000s cars from europe is gonna be a cool era, wanna get my hands on a Volvo S60 D5, how do i get parts? how do i afford it? WHO CARES!?
The S3 is definitely my favorite. I'd see these all the time when in the UK. Always wanted one, but they would not bring the two-door over. I think because it would eat into the GTI/R market.
Dear everyone looking to import a car to America: Canada’s rule is 15 years. I’m no expert, but I’m pretty sure driving across the border is more affordable than freight across an ocean.
250k for like what 290 HP ??? Those GTR’s are seriously over hyped and cost way to much
Only thing i would pull off is a slammed minivan. Cuz thats funny as hell
Brilliant video James. It is wonderful to see your channel being a success.
Weird why haven’t your video popped up, until now and I followed.
😂 u be surprised how many ppl doesnt know about the 25 yrs rule, those chinese ev on ebay arent classified as a "car", there arent any sort of steel beams inside those 😂
Peugeot 406 coupé !
A Speeed video AND a Vin_tra video in the same day?? We are blessed 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Cool cars that Americans can make overpriced
God I wanna get a Toyota crown wagon so bad
Is vauxhall vx220 gonna import in us?
Thanks a lot. I have had an unhealthy obsession with the first generation Renault 5 turbo for years. Now I have a whole new Renault to obsess over. I guess at least I can pretend I might be able to afford the Clio.
Whats everyones favorite  cars on the list in the video?
I have watched James Videos on the Dount Media  channel, but I found out today he had a new Channel
Mate, I hope the fires haven't affected you too much. Stay safe out there and I love you
Awsome Video James
why u have belgium flag on german cars?
Who here likes James Channel🙋‍♂️
One of my favorite things about James's videos have always been that he tells us that he loves us at the end of the video every time
Keep going James! Im here for it !
Thankful that Canada has a 15 year rule and that I got to grow up to see a lot of these cars at local meets before they skyrocketed in price.
This is exactly the type of video I wanted to see when I heard he was starting his own channel
wait... Wasn't Opel Speedster originally British? Ah, yes, it was.
Holding my breath for the R36 estate
Hatchbacks are back baby
Oh those greeaheasssyyy hrsprs...
2:14 based moment
I'd add Crown Majesta to the list. 4.0 V8 VVTI (1UZ-FE) and i-Four with RWS. Air suspension and TEMS. Magnificent.
Dark Matter By Blake Crouch will blow your mind!
Love ya, pump
The Audi b5 RS4 is by far one of the best cars I’ve driven i’ve had multiple versions I used to buy and sell cars in England so I had anything from the Audi S3 2007 all the way up to an Audi RS6 2011. and multiple M3 and C63 AMG.  And by far the RS4 is my favorite   You have to upgrade the front brakes to the 2007 RS4 brakes and you’re all good
1 more year for the VW Beetle RSI
I love you
I saw a Renault Clio for the first time in my life this past year ripping at the track. the thing was sweet and like nothing I'd ever seen before
Thank you for possibly inflating the price of one of my dream cars
The Clio V6 was also one of my dream cars since playing GT back in the day on the PS1. Such a cool car, always loved MR cars since the original GT40 which i'll never own. Some MR2's are also pretty nice but they're only 4bangers
This is great stuff.
So is the R34 actually legal to own and drive in the States, now? I thought I'd seen somewhere else it was a "well yes but actually no" situation.
Love how low you slouch. Genuinely. Don’t lose your you-ness…. You risk that with all that “self improvement” stuff.    Keep up the wonderful vids. The love goes both ways!
How do you talk about Japanese vans without mentioning Toyota Hiace 4WD’s or Mitsubishi Delica 4WD’s? They’re way cooler.
We love you too mate. Love your enthusiasm, and your videos. Just found your channel here, always watched your old school stuff and loved the OG car videos you put out. Excited for more content
Missed the ford xr6
Only 2 more years for 4th gen hilux surfs with the 1kdftv 3.0 turbo diesel
coolist
Clio v6 is easy winner on this list for me. I'm sick of giant pig cars that weigh 3 tons and cost 50k+
18:06 dont you ever double grip the mic like that again😂😂
That Holden looks like a Cadillac Catera.
If you decide to buy a clio v6 be careful with the phase 1 they tend to overheat and catch on fire which is not a good news. Also the clio 2rs is already a great sportcar with a 2L na engine producing between 172hp up to 182hp and the car weighs around 1 ton
I love you, James
To your point at 12:40 I truly hope that young car enthusiasts that are also mechanically inclined are courageous enough to develop their own platform/model of vehicle that can compete on a *somewhat* level playing field. However, the advent of the electric car is what I believe to be the downfall of vehicle design and uniqueness. You can create "low voltage" batteries that would equate to the same horsepower as an I4 for example, while at the same time creating a battery that mimics the "power" or "horsepower" of a V8 or even V12! But, what you have to consider is: Size, Weight, Cooling (batteries get very hot), and longevity. Again, I really hope that young car-enthusiast engineers can maintain and appreciate the combustion engine and what its capable of.
35k i respect ur bag but that ain’t me
Nice shirt James !
Damn that outro got me, i felt that man
North America did get the Opel Speedster... as the Saturn Sky...
Keep putting out banger after banger
The subliminal messaging is on POINT! XD
Nice Polo James.
I bought a 1998 Toyota Progrês NC 250 (1JZ)  RHD with 76k miles back in August. Bone stock.  It’s the same platform as the Lexus Altezza/IS. When I get some actual extra dollars , I’ll start upgrading things. It’s been my daily for a few months now.
I’ve been waiting for someone to make a video about the newly available imports and I’m damn glad it was James who made it.
Bro the Clio V6 is litteraly a drivable coffin lmao. Everyone who tried one just says the rear just wants to spin the whole car at the first mistake.
eee? You meen tooooooooo many ads!  This is the most ads that have ever been in a vid this long. Nuts!
Damn ads ery 2 cars! Come on Pumph!
We love you too James. Donut is still amazing, but your channel is special.
Thank you for what you do, after a long day of slinging recall transmission jobs at the dealership it always feels like I’m just listening to a close friend talk to me. I love your videos so much<3
The more rare Aussie sedan you can now buy is the TE/TS 50 Tickford's (luxed/powered up Falcon's) !  Came with handbuilt, Alloy GT40 cylinder heads and intake, headers, roller rockers 302w engines. In '02 the even more special series 3 version got a stroker crank 342 cube version !!
I honestly expected the ford falcon instead of a commodore for the Aussie section due to it being 100% aussie made.
Not true. I had an IS300 here in California with a 5 speed manual. Also, it wasn’t in the 2000s when car companies started sharing platforms. It was it the early 90s such as the 3000gt and the stealth or the eclipse and the eagle many more.
Gran Turismo episode?
Big OpTic Hecz are you here?
The clio is one of my dream cars
always loved the clio its perfect
cant wait to import my own Zonda in 50 years
Waiting for the mk1 focus rs
I JUST WANNA KNOW IF YOU AND JERRY AND JOBE ARE BOYS
My personal favorite that’s over 25 years old is the V12 Toyota Century
I can finnaly get a Clio in the states.....but faced with moving to a new city here in two months 😢 been my dang dream car since frigging trismo as well dude 😐 one day we will mob side by side bröther
2:20 😉😉😉
2000 Subaru Forester Sti. I’m just trying to find the perfect one now
Love the list! Would love it more if it had some 4×4s like some Samurais
Sorry dude, can't watch 25 commercials for your segment. Not worth my time
Another video of you ruining the car scene
It’s interesting you mention it, I found one in japan, just sitting there, possibly abandoned, it was used by an old tuning shop, I hope I can pick it up
Good luck maintaining these cars lol they probably don’t have parts available even in the countries they are coming from
Imagine k swapping the lupo🥶🥶🥶
Pick #4; Shut up and take my Dollareedoos, mate! A Holden Commodore Ute is my dream car!
Dude, the Bam margera reference aged me, lol, but it's so damn true.
How to spot the American YouTuber…. This 🇧🇪 is the same as 🇩🇪😂😂😂
Cool list, but like half was VW( I know they’re your favorite), but not one Honda?!?  Not a NSX type S, an Accord SiR or Euro R, a Torneo, a city, S2000 type s, etc…
On James's final note: Capitalism is essentially a trade of X for Convenience, usually X being Original, Genuine, Detailed, and, Flawed things. Cool cars are not convenient, they are hard to maintain, find parts for, to learn how to fix, most people would rather have boring cars that you can buy anywhere, repair anywhere, and sell anywhere. This late stage of Capitalism is up 100 times what was before, for cars, clothes, for culture in general. Tough talk might just be the world should've never been this convenient? Perchance.  About James: I can't fucking believe how funny, alive and relaxed he is. I honestly hadn't seen him like this since the early UptoSpeeds, in the last Donut episodes it was like witnessing the documentary on a man being purged from his soul. I actually thought it was just the age, life, or perhaps something medical. Donut had fucking squeezed life out of my poor guy, I'm so happy to see him like this.  This channel actually feels taken out of 2012 Youtube, like old cars, it's just has so much soul, such a fucking vibe to it. Gotta enjoy as much as we can.  PD: James if you are reading this you are the GOAT
Emo james is a gut punch
such dope cars, thanks for the video
Right hand drive fast cars in the United States make no sense. Why you ask. You can’t pass anybody unless you have a copilot with you because you can’t see around anybody because you’re sitting on the wrong side.😮 so why why why would I buy a super fast car right hand drive? It’s only good for track days..
I am just curious how did the Belgian flags go unnoticed throughout the whole video for German cars.
I thought they didn't do these "D-list" things anymore?
16:50 thats a hsv xu6 that come w a buick 3.8 supercharged motor and makes close to 250hp
Yet another reason to miss the 90s, especially starting this week.
Tvr are a mad car. Sounds beautiful.  But it's unreliable 😂
James, I don’t think I’ve posted this on any of your previous videos, but I love you too, man.  Keep up the great work!
Begins with the Fr*nch 😮
It cost 10 grand to import a car to the United States. Even the ones from Japan.? well that answers that question😊
Could you imagine how much of a pain in the ass it would be to fix your varietta top?! I have trouble getting my z soft top to go back down 😵‍💫
The Zonda has been a dream car for me for a long time. Its such a wild car. I love it.
I've been watching your videos for years James I'm glad you're still doing something you enjoy man
French connection of making the engine bigger and putting in in the back is the right fix for every car ever built😊
How do people in California get around the smog restrictions and dmv regulations
still no r34
Bro said affordable and then comes out swinging with 40k
I mean I can't wait to Import cool 2010s-2020s deisel wagons from Germany in 25 years from now!
Nice job.
But Shmee150’s Mid engine Cleo, I think he said he would sell it.
The Varietta is trash, the boot is too long and it only ever came with an auto SR20DE 😢
So many hatch backs!!!! ❤❤❤
The clio is one of my dream cars I’ve always wanted since gt as well
That end bit's really true, new cars these don't have that special kind of stank on them that made us all car people. We don't want something that looks like was designed to be perfect in some lab, we want a car that feels like it was made by someone who woke up in the middle of the night with a really cool/terrible idea.
Wait.. the Zonda is 25 years old? i feel old man.
Couldn’t agree more with everything you said at the end about how cars used to be. I’m a mechanic and in my shop we get a lot of older vehicles. They can be a pain in the ass to fix but they seem to have some kind of character or soul. Maybe they have something to tell you.
You lost me at Varietta. You got me back at the Holden.
Renault Clio is a dream car
Why don’t you guys talk about Toyota Mark X 2gr it’s the best sedan ever
What kind of rims r those behind you!
Love Belgian cars!
soo many ads
I hope it's not your fault but man, 2 unskippable ads every couple minutes?? Really??
Am I high or is 7 a minivan? 14:06    Also I 10/10 want an m12 noble
Wht doesn't Americans appreciate and go after nissan  laurels and Cefiro.  Everything u want in a car super reliable and comes with allot of engune optiins easy to work on a big aftermarket
That polo is hard
Dude....and ad every like 4 minutes?
STOP TALKING ABOUT THE VX220 DAMMIT! I WANT ONE BEFORE THEY GET RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE.
Sweet
This was nice
Man ive always wanted the  Audi S3
"weird color that looks like a foamposite" has me laughing my ass off
Based as fuck about France and the rich, and definitely do not do this 😉
This basically my garage from Gran Turismo 3 on the PS2.
Bro these videos r edited so well they flow perfectly audio is great and cool visuals!!! AMAZING!!!
Thats the problem with social media. Before people we're connected like they are today with social media, everybody had his own personality, so to speak. Now, since the whole world is connected, 1 thing is popular all over the world. Making uniqueness obsolete. You're right to be sad. I dont want to be a robot like in the "IRobot" movie. Stacked in lines of the same thing by billions. Whats the point of being alive when the whole world had the same flavor and the same color. Things would suck.
I wanna manual swap a Toyota origin and drift it bc it's basically a JZX underneath
Thank you James for everything you have done and continue to do, you have zero idea how much your outlook on life and the way you articulate it helps me sometimes. Keep on Keeping on brotha
A subscription service to fix your subscription services? What could go wrong
Belgium made cool cars like the lupo, the audi s3 and so on 😂😂😂😂
i want a skyline gtr so bad
Come on Americans, we know you love our Commodores and our Falcons
Big fan of donut for a long time. That dude in blue also. All of it really. I just love cars. I just dont understand the depression about car culture now. I am in the garage building something cool right now. Yall are becoming the well back in my day person. Cool people will still be creating and making coll stuff cheer up.
❤
i worked with a kid who had a VW bora. clowned the guy for just owning a VW jetta lol. (im in canada and we dont have the 25 year import thing)
Damn YouTube!, had more adds than your video bro 😂😂😂
I bought both a Toyota Will Vl will be here next month AND Yes I bought a Toyota Origin! But that won't be here until September, they didn't start making them until August
Damn you like aged like 20 years
I love Audi’s but they don’t age well. I have owned a B5 and a B6 s4 both being avants F&$@ing loved them with lots of TLC but they are a nightmare to own as they age. so many wiring harness issues. 😢   I miss my Nogaro Blue B6 S4 avant it was absolute a joy to drive. I miss driving it on to the freeway or crawling through parking structure setting off car alarms.
DON'T TELL ANYONE ABOUT THE VX220 YET PLEASE. Wait until I can afford one... in 15 years.
most these cars you better be rich to afford the repairs / maint
Okay the CKY reference was exactly how I felt, I wanted Bam's blue Audi most of my life
Well I guess now I know why I’ve never seen a Pagani in real life 😂 I didn’t know there weren’t allowed in the US
14:40 that's bangbus isn't it
13:24 Theres also the Toyota Caldina GT4N with 3S GTE making 260 horse power
... meanwhile, Afeela's been plaguing my youtube lately.... not feeling it though... 😂
I’ll be wanting to import a civic double R when it’s available in 8 years or so. Not everything is dead import wise in future but it will come down to packages we never got.
Flip that Belgian flag for Germany come one guys
So,the editor doesnt know,the difference between the Germany 🇩🇪 and Belgium 🇧🇪
Australian cars always look like the grand theft auto version of American cars 😂
cool guys are in book clubs
The mw2 level up sound when he said varietta lool
Are all those cars Belgian or
I've got a 2jz gita if someone wants to buy and import it 😂
I am getting Steve from blu’s clues vibes lol
I want a toyota starlet or a levin
You have the rest of the falcon line to wait for.
11:23 That's actually the Ibiza cupra R in the picture, which is based on the polo 6n2
Make a list about what foods cause the nastiest farts
Ending didnt need to have me in tears man
SPEEEEEED!!!!!!!
SPEEED AND BIG TIME ARE SO MUCH BETTER. I can't wait for the firearms videos!
dude wheres that pagani lambo that's fucking sick and gotta be worth all the money
I wanted to watch thid video but then i remembered im a student and cant even afford groceries
Thanks for bringing this back. My first YouTube i watched was with the red mr2 . No clue who the heck you were and fell in love since then
Could I still do the pinegrove shuffle to the outro?
I'm sorry man, I can't even watch these anymore. Way too many commercials
Yo can you please make an episode on group a, b, and c racing. Or something on top secret and Smokey Nagata
Donut who?
You seem sad, Please pretend to be happy again, we all need it too.
lol James Pumpkin still spreading misinformation.  The Altezza Gita never came with the 3S-GE 4 cylinder engine.  You're confusing it for the BEAMS 2000 1G-FE. A 2 litre twin cam 6 cylinder.   Altezza Gita came as either the AS200 (1G-FE) or the AS300 (2JZ-GE).  The air filter holder on a 1GFE will have a Lexus badge on the IS200, but will have "BEAMS 2000" on the AS200.   Please don't confuse the Americans into buying Altezza sedans and wagons with the "beams engine" thinking that they're going to get the RS200 with the 3S-GE, when in reality alot of Altezzas were AS200.  Actually nah, let them import them all the auto AS200's and get ripped off lmaooooo
Umm Bro. You have Klein in the background!!!  Sensational!!!
Time stamps
Great video! Extra points for the Klein  You should review bikes too
I'm all about that TVR. I'm all about most of the TVR lineups. Also that Renault.... Mmmmm.
Went to New Zealand for the first time and was shocked to see just how many Toyota Estimas there are. Its probably the single most common vehicle in New Zealand lol
Renult Sport division knows how to party.
The most ad-happy channel ever! I have never had so many ads in a ~20 minute video. Yt is fkn outta control!
16:55 that’s a Saturn bro
I had my room plastered with the majority of these cars in hs cause I had the chance to buy car mags imported from Europe. It's awesome to see Renault, SEAT, and the wagons get some love 💪💪💪
who knew after all these years the Belgiums were selling Germany their cars
neat
Gotta dang add every 90 seconds geez
I was today years old when I found out the S15 had a convertible version
That rocket money transition was cleeeaaaannn
Here come the americans buying all of them cars again
James you need a vr6 lupo you know you do lol...
Praying for California. My homie lost his gargae home and 4 custom lowriders.
Thanks man! You made me smile and laugh with this sweet video !! 😂🤙🏻 keep the same vibe bro!! Cheers
The only thing left worth waiting for at this point is the E46 M3 CSL.
No rank for the RS4?
Ya boy say cheap... Naw were do i get 40k? 🙄🤡
can we get the turbo rs rally clio too? because Ive always wanted to take a clio v6, a clio RS turbo, and a spare RS turbo front clip and build a twin engine awd clio with two of the turbo 4cyl they use in ralley.  a teeny tiny miniature escudo pikes peak basically.  with a crazier wide body and snow plow looking aero.  its been a dream since nfs underground lol
Wait, where has James been? Why he got a donut mic? I’m so confused but excited?
We still don’t get enough wagons
James the gita’s only came with the 1gfse manual they never made a 3sge one but I understand where the confusion is because beams was a name for the variable valve timing system also you could get the 2jz in a awd version fun fact 2jZ is direct injected with those the engine code is 2jzfse
you would love the suzuki swift sport. it's almost the same size and weight as a renault 5 turbo with 138 hp. it's not that fast, but its weight makes it feel very agile.
I mean this car was a 1997 model but how can it have never appeared on one of these lists?!?!?!  97 Mitsubishi RVR Hyper Sport Gear R  A fuckin small minivan with insane bodykit,  Recaro fishnet seats and the driveline from a FUCKIN EVO 3!!!!  Japanese advert for the model - https://youtu.be/jo_uqp_l6sE?si=9_ZoNHL_3rL0VDYI  And that's the just the jewel of the RvR line, check out the Open gear etc while you're there
the holden was here as the cadillac catera
Always been a fan of the Clio since NFS Underground!
That Clio is like if you multiplied a Suzuki Alto works by 2 hoooly
You got long covid like me boss?
This isn’t the donut channel 😟
It turns out Belgium made lots of interesting cars.
Do a video about bikes/that Klein!!!
Way to put TVR on the list. I first fell in love with the Cerbera via Gran Turismo, but after seeing the speed 6 in "Swordfish", that car is the chef's kiss🤌 Halle Berry's role in that movie may make me a little biased lol
Idk there are still some cool newer cars we didn’t get over here. m3 wagons. those newer toyota trucks that are super simplistic. I’m sure there’s more
Renault Clio v6 is a dream car. Thanks NFS Carbon ❤
Um, Toyota is making FJ 70s new today. Heard of it?
Dude way to many commercials. I know it's money but F@$k man.
TOYOTA SELL THE 70s SERIES LAND CRUISER IN THE US PLEEEEAAAAASSE
yay the car i want to import isnt on the list so i still have time to afford it lol. also Open Air Imports has and rs4 for sale rn
My life will be complete when I can get James to sign my bluray copy of awful nice
Damn… Belgium waited 80 years to sneak attack Germany and claim ownership of all their industries
Wyclef had a Zonda 15 years ago
I cant get any of these and import sadly
Great video with very interesting cars. It would be wow also to do the same video with the limiter that you have to pick diesels
What so you think about the potential outlaw of driving in the future? They wanna make driving illegal man wtFREAK
Never knew that about Pagani. Holy shit lol
Love you too, James
was that a call of duty sound effect lmao @3:26
Thank you for the videos! To me you were Donut! Loving the new channel and the content!
You put the pointer for 4.9 at 3.9.
Love this James! Keep it going ! We are here for you and the ways you can speak to us and teach us! Long live @speeed
My number 1 would be the Clio.
Hey James was that you I saw in a Pizza Hut commercial on YT?  You're standing outside trying to deliver some pizza and wings to two guys arguing over which is better. If not you got a major clone running around!
MR Pumphrey, I think you could pull off a TVR
We are all becoming those old guys that say, “well back in my day.” The difference is… it was actually different and we were the last generation that had analog. I know i love your thoughts and viewpoint on things. Thank you for making these.  Keeps me young.
check Peugeot 206 GTI or RC! :))
By now, everyone should know to automatically hit the 👍🏻 when coming through the door. Now let me go and enjoy the latest Speed episode.
James, dope Lo knit.
Yeah but we got the RS6 !  Was literally my second car as an adult actually making decent $
As a Lupo (non-GTI) owner, if you're american, first of, HAHA GET A REAL COUNTRY, second point, if you can't afford the GTI or you can't find one because they're pretty rare, you can import the regular one. I own the 1.4 75 HP one and it's like 90% there, it still weights 900 kg, my engine is the same as the Polo so it moves, it's a go kart you can pick up your mates with. They're incredibly cheap and really a blast to drive, it doesn't feel like a grocery getter at all. They also made a 101 HP version if you want MO POWA BABY
Mk1 Focus RS is coming up soon.
The Tuscan is a car you need to drive if you’re are a schemer. I want one.
That Audi RS wagon.😎🔥
The reason the Holden kinda looks like a pontiac is bc pontiac stole some Holden's and put their badge on it. You can get an even sicker version of number 4 already in america called the Pontiac GTO or the Pontiac G8
You’re the best, always a pleasure to watch your videos. You keep your head up :)
Ive always wanted the the clio V6 since using it nfs most wanted
The S3 has been at the top of my list. That same 07K from your MK3, in the S3, equals DIY RS3. 👀
I'm proud of your weight loss my guy keep it up💪🤝🤔
ARGENTINA MENTIONED 🗣🗣🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
Screw having a skyline, all I want is a holden ute. Living in North Alabama I guarantee that would be breaking necks everywhere I went.
The Pagani Zonda is closer to $20 million
Not on the Discord but I vote for Project Hail Mary. Amazing book!
Do an episode about that Klein road bike.
I love you too James!
I want a Clio so badly, and a Megane.
As a crazy Trevor myself, I approve of everything TrevCar/TVR
Not a Noble. Its a Rossion Q1. I have one. https://youtu.be/6hcF0Ilkaxk?si=wylVZsTwZK1G4Ejz&t=1102
Can't help but notice that most of these are European. 90es ending in Japan was such bittersweet moment. On the topic of less and less stuff to import year after year, in 2042 you'll be able to import a Genesis G80 with a 2.0 liter Theta 4 cylinder (yes, the one from Sonata) lmao
Legendary video
21:08 THIS MOMENT almost made me cry cause yeah we don't see many colors, we don't see many shapes, all sedans, all SUVs, all cars are soo copycat and ppl only want now self drive, comfy daily drivers that don't leave space for cool cars, or at least you need to look reeeeeaaaally hard to fing a cool car nowdays
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I disliked immediately for the thumbnail showing a RenaultSport Clio V6 Phase 2, which won't be available until 2028. 0:59... Annnndddd you didn't manage to do a 30 seconds worth of research.... that's not the Clio that will be available in 2026... The Phase 1 is a 2001-2003 model and looks completely different. It's also a bit of a mess as it was thrown together with minimal development. The Phase 2 is what you'd actually want to buy.
Did anyone else get 1 ad every 60 seconds?
@2:17 , we definitely should NOT do that… never! Do NOT do that!!!!
Thanks for the vid!  Also, whats the name of the vocal track at the end w/spinning Speeed Logo, if you don't mind me asking... lol, I wanted to hear more of it as well
21:03 not just Mercedes, he got those engines out of AMG!! Nobody but nobody got AMG engines when he pulled that off.
Trevor named the company TVR in the 1950s so that it's name wouldn't clash with the famous Tom Walkinshaw TWR team name which would come in the 1980s. Truly forward thinking Trevor was.
Didn't the opel speedster/ VX220 come to the US as a Saturn?
I like when you end your videos on a kinda Bourdain-like reflection. It’s cool.
That 70’s vibe 💯
Love you too, James.
ARGENTINA! ARGENTINA! ARGENTINA!
Book club
James is giving off father of youtube vibes today
Can you make cool cars to import from Brazil?
I work at a Chevy dealership and a local gentleman did import a commodore ute and has it serviced at our dealership! So cool to see the first time he pulled up, only a few of us actually knew what it was
out of all of these the jsx is probably my favorite, achievable one.  granted the zonda is "chef's kiss" that none of us will get! but would definitely be cool to see some of the audis and the small vw gti around on the street, just not in my driveway
Cool episode James thanks🎉
James, you're the big bro I never had, and I love the direction you have taken this channel and the overall emotion that comes through it. You sharing your mindset has helped give me another way other thinking than my standard and I can't thank you enough.
So much want!!!
too many ads
I want a clio v6 so badly I cannot put it into words
12:11 same thing with the gmt  360/370 platform like 9 different cars were made on it 😂
Damn, 3 ad breaks in 7 mins is just ridiculous. James, u control how many ad breaks there is. Please stop abusing us like that man. OMG, another 1 by the time I'm done writing this comment. Seriously man...c'mon
I should have waited till the end of the video to comment. Epic closing on the video! As a Gen X, I miss the cars of pre 2000s that I grew up with and wished I could own one day. And I don't think there's really many cars like that anymore. Maybe a handful from the 00s. But now there's too many generic SUVs with old sport car monikers on them that used to be cool. I wish car manufacturers would stop watering down their sport/race badges to specs of trim level.
14:24 the 2nd generation Previa👀
Ive been watching James for a loooong time now, and all I can say is I get instantly happy seeing a video get posted. Gone through stuff as well and I feel very grateful to still be able to watch his videos. Would’ve never bought my gr86 without watching this guy. I drowned it but thats another story 😅 Thank you James!!
Do german cars where made in belgium?
The Clio is the only car I want from this list
i am now convinced the Belgium flag exists solely to confuse people
I want the holden version of the Subaru Baja when do I get that
bro mentioned seat ibiza and not mg f, the cheapest weekend car
If you liked the Varietta S15, Google this:   SuperStreet Varietta "Sittin' on Chrome"  I remember seeing this as a kid in 2007 and I've never forgotten it. Incredibly cool build.
average american geography skills
That rs4 wagon bro🤤🤤🤤
The TVR was one of those cars that top gear made cool
I regret selling my vr6 caravelle. Never had a more stupid car. Never loved a car so much. 😢
There's a guy with a Lupo GTI near where I live. Even tho' this is Spain and those cars are relatively easy to find, when I was looking for a car for me, I could only find one on sale, I ended up with an Abarth.
Staahhhppp telling people about #6. You’re gonna make my parts expensive!
If I can't get a VW Up then the Lupo GTI would be the next best thing. Love these stripped down videos James. Keep it up. Very chill to watch.
I was going to look I this put for fun but you did the research for me. Thanks! :)
I Understand James needs to pay the bills and all but fuck off at the ads every 25 seconds!🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Whoever does the editing of these videos, massive respect for the original modern warfare rank-up sound effect. 3:27
How did you miss the “Swordwish”reference at 7:24.  Awesome video!!!!!
One cool car you forgot was the Subaru Legacy B4 twin turbo
I just bought an 1987 S12
Just got a honda civic ep2 as my first car; ts gonn be cooolll
I came from donut and it’s JAMES
Watching this instead of studying for exams and no money to buy cars
Just waiting for next year so I can import the Avantime
'00 Ford Escort RS Cosworth (only 200k LOL wut...) -or maybe one of the many other hatchback fords we never got.
Robert plant approving of number 3
3:01 I learned about the Cleo V6 from Top Gear😂
This is fantastic content. I really like it
I couldn’t wait for the 4 motion Bora… already have a 05 VW (mk4) Jetta TDI… I imported the all wheel drive😉😉 I found me a loop hole without having to Frankenstein the driveline…. But I should’ve invested in a 6speed AWD swap😭😭 but hey its still runs and drives. Might do a Rally in my FWD 05(mk4) TDI. THIS SATURDAY…. Deciding if I want to wake up that early and make the almost 3 hour trip
The cool import games aren't totally over for you guys stateside.  As a former Ford tech here in Australia I know there's some cool almost 25 year old cars here.   You're 2 years away from being able to import the first year of Barra powered Ford Falcons.   The XR6 Turbo was a great car. In both sedan and ute.   They also had the XR8 with Boss V8 (double overhead cam version of the Ford modular) also in both sedan and ute.   A few years later Ford launched FPV (Ford Performance Vehicles) their in-house performance arm.   They built the GT, GT-P sedans and Pursuit ute with the V8. F6 sedan and Typhoon utes with the turbo Barra.  As well as the F6X turbo Territory SUV.  Much later Ford introduced the G6, G6E and G6E Turbo luxury sedans. I believe the G6E got an FPV version for a luxury performance option.
But that's a European cherokee tho😂
Love the show etc. but please compress the VO & remove the plosives. It’s like fingernails on a chalkboard, please… better pop filter, better mic control… something.
1st good video s
The Maserati 3200GT was never released in the US
How the renault is 15 and not 1. Beyond me
As an aussie the only issue with the holdens is that the build quality of the interiors isnt good unless you buy the Maloo or HSV models, they'll fall apart real quick
That Opel Speedster still looks new
To anyone listening: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T BUY A 25YR OLD AUDI.
SQEEEEB
FOAMPOSITE NAME DROP!!!! RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Clio V6 is a tribute to the Renault 5 Turbo 2, an even better crazy hothatch from the 80s
Eternally curious how cars imported that are between 1996 and 2000 pass emissions, if at all
Hey James, good video bud!
2 ads per car is diabolical, truly disappointing
The ending made me feel something I’ve never felt before. I was born in 2003 so I never really saw the cars of that time in their era. Wow what a time that must’ve been
He's such a dude so much so, idm watching the ads
A skyline for 250K?! where are you getting it?
Still two more years for the last two models of FD RX7’s as well. I actually just bought an ‘01 here in Okinawa. Bringing it back with me.
XR6 or XR8 Falcon from Australia for me The joys of being Canadian, I can import cars 10 years before the US
BOOOOOKKKKK CCLLLLLUUUUUBBBBBB!!!!!!!
TVR. The W is upside down on the logo
I'd get a Twingo lol... doing a cross country road trip to get a 04' TT VR6 tomorrow and hit tail of the dragon after visiting the Lane Motor museum on the way home :) PS, daaaym that lupo is too expensive. 8 grand? too much. Silvita or whatever looks like a Solara. Ick. TVRs are ugly.. Brit cars are all like cheap kit cars. I'd love an RS4 Avant, but too much cheese! I'd really like the new RS4 Avant Competition... that's only like 130k lol. S3 got me thinkin' I had a 15' S3 but those early hatchbacks are clean.
I Really Like The Content and am Subscribed But for Some Reason Every Time I Watch Your Videos, I'm Bombarded With Much More Commercials Than any Other Channel. I don't Know if You Have Control over That Aspect or Not . But Trust Me it Takes The Fun out of Watching Your Content.
How about all of y'all that watch this video? Take the time and contact your representative to attempt to get this ridiculous, 25 year law repealed🤷
Time to import a vw lupo diesel
James. How about top cars for big boys n gals and others that are fun and we can fit in!! Pls! Love the new channel and stay healthy since u had the hart issue it would b disappointing for the fam to be reckless but that’s y we love ur research and vibe. Love always. Ssstevo.
Let’s get a BRABUS video. We all want it. We know you want to make it. Let’s see it!!
i absolutely love the VX220/Speedster ever since i drove it in forza motorsport 4
*laughs in Canadian*
13:48 the run on sentence Toyota ad is top notch humor
we lucky in uk weve always been allowed to import whatever we want from wherever we want lol
Make a vid for the young British fans you got broski
Wait for another 4 years, and you can start importing the ford falcon xr6 turbo from Australia....its got the " aussie 2j " or " 4JZ" in it...the turbo, 4 litre straight 6 Barra!
18:00 is that Robert Plant?
Ironic the year I'm able to finally import my dream ute is the same year I buy a caballero!
People forget that r34 was made in multiple trims. Idc if it’s a base model or a gt, it makes it way more obtainable.
I respect you for going it alone, I designed my own brand of cars at the age of 12, called Quazar, it featured cars called Gemini, Nebula and Saturn... I leased a Saturn years later... Thanks for your entertainment.
The Renault is probably one of my dream cars ngl
Every year is a new - WTF can I import now? Oh yeah, I rent so I have no place to store the car - DAMN IT!
Oooh the cupra and leon are some of my all time favorite cars of all time.
god these are like all the cool cars on old top gear we could only dream of in the usa!
If Nolan ever leaves Donut, PLEASE add him to your team <3
Great content. Never seen so many ads in a video before though.
I'm pretty sure the topsecret supra had a v12 century engine with two separate ecu to control each bank of cylinder
Hell yah brother! Been waiting for more car videos! May I please add the Toyota Dyna to the list....gonna snag one of these babies soon. Perfect for someone looking for a rig that wants to be unique.
TOO MANY ADS
I can't wait for 2050 when we're talking about bringing over electric wagons
Suv's have killed off a lot of things here in the US. I honestly wish the trend of " gotta have an suv " would end. Every new car lot is just full of lame SUVs, crossovers, and trucks. We need cars, and wagons. Not an apt sized vehicles that suck down the gas they already dont want us to use anymore 😒.
Any Zondas on FB marketplace?
You need to make an “affordable” list and a “dream” list or possible imports :)
the videos just get better and better. i came into this video thinking im gonna have some bad ideas, and came out with bad ideas and James support. my wallet will soon have a gaping hole.
1 sided much? No Hondas or subarus
Damn, 95k views in 5 hours? Bagel Media really fell off
That shirt goes hard
What’s the song at the end?
Awesome vid dude. Thanks.
Wake me up when a Gen 1 Focus RS can be imported...
This is awesome reason why I love being Canadian lol. All these cars were available to us 10 years ago. It's only 15 years here as opposed to 25 years in the US ❤❤
A Holden UTE would be the ultimate parts vehicle
This was excellent drunk history on purchasing vintage, cool cars thanks
I'm 7 minutes in and have had 4 ad rolls wth...
Wanna get something close enough to a Clio V6 but keeping the practicality of a FWD hatchback and a more reasonable price? The Clio 2 RS can deliver and it's way more safe to drive than the first series of Clio V6 : unless you're a rally driver you're gonna wreck it in the first ten sharp turns. You can even get bodywork kits to have the look of a Clio V6 on any standard Clio 2.
3:53 we used to say this late 90s early 2000s about certain makes and models. Example in 1999 the Infinity I-30 on tu tone BBS... PYMP.   K2 Jetta... Kinda PYMP.
Im still wondering why i saw a Renault Clio V6 in Connecticut last summer. It had a bunch of race decals on it, sounded insane, and everyone was wondering what it was. I was at a popular ice cream shop of all places lol.
I really hoped you would mention the opel zafira opc. It is a really cool sports-minivan.
Love the outro
He said Riley is 2000 lbs
⛪️ 0:01
Your car analogy is spot on. All of my friends asked me why I purchased my VW Tourage with the V8. It was the end of a bygone era when cars had personality and a sense of individualism.
Thank you for the CKY reference
Yay james!!!!!
You probably won't see this but my family actually owns one of, if not the largest bookstore in Brevard county FL. NU2U books. Glad to see a fanbase I'm a part of collide with one I was whisked into by accident. Also for those trying to decide "Project Hail Mary" is by the same author as "The Martian" and my sister loved it. And Blake Crouch is hugely popular right now and "Dark Matter" was also a favorite of my sister. However Cormac McCarthy is a classic so it's definitely a great roster
The only car I need is a yellow Renault Clio v6 phase 2 right hand drive
You could have gotten a Noble here in the US.  It’s called a Rossion Q1 they were built in FL.
James was like *wait I'm rich* yeah don't do that
I've been watching the prices in that Renault Clio V6 for years... I hope they don't fo up now that you made a video mentioning it
You missed out on the beautifully designed Australian made AU Falcon 😂, the pinnacle of Ford Australia.  😂
Did you summon me here? I feel like I was summoned here for some reason.....
James , are you my dad ?
I thought Zondas was already in America
I friggin love you James❤️ hope you’re doing well brother
One more year until, New Beetle RSi
...... I had to watch 8 ads throughout this video. Should I quit YouTube?
The holdens are just Pontiac G6 with a face lift, I'll save money and get a G6
How can you mention the RS4 and not mention porche's involvement.
I get you. I have a 1993 chevy lumina that i bought for 600 bucks here in gardena. 49k miles. I LOVE this car. It sticks out like a sore thumb. Need to get some work done on it but its in really decent shape. It hits so different than a new car. I want it to last forever. Also, James, so glad you're back. It's you!
I bought a Mitsubishi Evolution 6 Tommi Mäkkinen Editions in 2023... In left hand drive, look it up. I'm almost ready to import it.
I used to be this way as a kid over American cars in Australia my mates dad imported a 93 Camaro and we thought it was the coolest thing in the world lol
flip the TVR logo upside down and you'll see the "W"
Seeing the Phase 2 Clio V6 in the thumbnail made this an instant watch for me. Genuinely one of my favourite cars of all time.
I love you, say it back
Good to see you again bro.
Another sick video. You're the best James.
Altezza wagons do not get the 3S beams btw
Simple question? Why is it that whenever you talk about "Australian cars" its only holden which isn't actually Australian, they are opal's with American engines. You know that Australia actually had ford Australia who had Australian designed and powered cars and would be awesome if you shed some light on them.
I’m deadass gunna start reading speeed thank you for your infinite wisdom
How many ads are in this videos?
This video goes to show just how little he needed donut. Not sure if any of the writers or graphics people came over with him, but this really reminds me of the pandemic era of donut.
I didn't skip a commercial for you James. Great video
The Toyota Estima is also known as the cockroache
Nissan Tsuru 2000GSR oh boy!
"if you have $250,000" well I still have checks left in my checkbook so that means I can't be out of money right?
HEY BUD COOL VIDEO BUT STOP GIVING NON CAR PEOPLE WITH MONEY IDEAS. By the time I can afford what I want the price will skyrocket from youtubers lol
Belgians flying high in the comments
It sucks being a bigger guy sometimes, 6’3 in one of these baby cars is my dream but I know I’m just gonna uncomfortable
Yo, so I have an idea for a book  club. So you have a drawing. Everyone in the club who wants to enter can. You pick 4 random winners then you have a vote. The final winner will have an affiliates link for there chosen title and everyone in the club buys there book from that link. Everyone gets a book to add to their library. At least one person gets some money. Everyone is happy
Why is there an ad every minute was tf come on James
As a matter of fact I do not have $250,000 to spend on a Nissan.
We love you to bro!
10:37 That’s a perfect analogy for that handsome little car, James. You should get one. It looks C L E A N in that yellow.
Is that a Cupra?
Chat, which car in this video is your favorite?
I saw a Nissan GTR- R34 in the Usa in the year 2024
how bout we just skip the Cilo and get the Turbo 2?
I’ve always loved that Renault.
I'm holding out for a toyota BB Open deck
that polo shirt is so clean
This guys fake excitement is cringe af.
Love your videos James, I want that Renault Clio so bad
E46 Compact
They now know about clio v6, don't let them find out about Peugeot rallye or GTI or T16. Hide Citroen Saxo cup😅
I owned a 4th generation Honda Odyssey RB3 back in Japan in 2009. I would absolutely want to have that again, but it won't be here for another 8 years.  Isuzu brought an earlier generation over here to the US as the Oasis, but that never took off and that generation was panned. But from the second generation, Honda figured it out and released something that took off overseas. We never got any generation after the disastrous Isuzu Oasis. That's a shame, because the RB series of Odysseys were fantastic.  The RB1 is still 3 years away, but if one shows up in reasonable shape, maybe I can recapture my youth.
In the year 2024, I saw the Mitsubishi Pajero Evolution in the United States
I love how I want an audi now :/
Gotta say, of all the ones I’ve seen that left bigger groups and went out on their own, I think I like you and your videos the best. And I didn’t even watch donut before, lol.
2025 is the year to Import  Toyota's apparently
clutch video g. God bless you.
everything started melting together, less special. Love the words on the end. Thank you for the videos, they brighten my world these days 🤝
My dad sold cars when I was younger and used to come back with demos. Driving the Vauxhall vx220 turbo was a highlight. So quick and like a sneaky lotus. Big fan.
Best Channel
I didn’t even know this guy could read
Besides the Toyota Crown which is quite common (outside US) you might opted for similiar size but rarer Toyota Chaser.
I was gonna give the editor the benefit of the doubt with the Lupo, because apparently there *was* some production in Belgium (no idea if that included the GTI, probably not), but once we got around to the RS 4, which was never manufactured outside of Germany, that pretty much confirmed what we were all thinking.
I ask you to no matter how preachy or crazy to you it may sound that you open the gospels being one of the 4 books of Matthew mark Luke or John and pray and truly have faith the size of a mustard seed and let the word of God show you the love Jesus has for you may God bless you
Hit the nail right on the head with that closing statement! Stuff seems to be losing the uniqueness or character that separates it from the rest
Can we get that insane golf they made over there, the mid engine awd golf they made. That thing was sick.!
Diggity dawg, ship my speeed Habits tee
Damn, my Audi A6 S-Line had that same motor as the RS Avant but in a much bigger and heavier car and it was fast in that heavy ass car, I can only imagine how much faster it is in the A4 chassis. I had a S4 or maybe a A4 s-line or something, but it had a manual transmission, a 2.0 liter turbo with 20 valves, 5 valves per cylinder. That car was fast, zero turbo lag. I miss that car but I sold it because I saw what the recommended services cost at the 70-100k miles.
I'll probably never get a chance to get one shipped to me because this vid and vids like these🥲
I want James to be fully nerd out on VWs
@19:01 Then, don't crash or wear a helmet. Crashing is avoidable, too. 😅 @19:26 More like something Jay Leno would buy. Zondas sell for ridiculous prices.
I didn't know Belgium made cars‽
Peganni was available in USA, just previously had to jump through the show and display import hoops, and still can do that for the newer ones.
Great, can't wait for prices to be jacked up because America tax lmao
WaZz up
Seriously the Clio v6 is my mind the poster child for "hot hatch"
2025, the year to import German cars apparently.
I can’t be alone I always trying to use the TVR Cerbera in Gran Tur, or the Forza games but couldn’t control it at all lol.  It’s an amazingly beautifull car with an absolute monster of a v12 if I remember correctly. The only time I’ve seen it in other places than games on online is that movie Swordfish I think, it’s got the bad guy from face off, Wolverine, the super hot girl from John Wick with the dogs. Great movie even if it’s completely ridiculous.
Excellent point about the homogenization of cars. I hadn't realized any of that.
Does the car needs to be 25 years old or it needs to have come out 25 years ago?!?! For the Clio V6 you don't want a first gen that came out in 2000, you want a phase 2 that came out in 2003.
Beware stolen holdens, see the CarExpert video about it
Hey, wasnt this clown on that dumb donut channel that died out? Hes gotten thinner... Must be eating into his steak & lobster budget
WASN DAS FÜRN KOMBI???
John Travolta drove a TVR tuscan in the 2001 film Swordfish, thats gotta give it some cool points
UK here leave them Clio's for us
If Audi made a RS4 or S4 in a couple, it would have ruled the era. A real GTR killer.
That belgian flag 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Only a Mazdaspeed lantis is left on this list
"Tell me this guy doesn't know how to have a specific kind of fun." Lol
The Lupo chassis is 6X my brother
21:45 is so true sadly
What the heck is affordable about a Clio that goes between 46k and 77k euros?!
He would probably get demonetized if he used the German flag
Lol they can't make a difference between Belgium and Germany 😂😅
That Lupo should be easy to turbo or swap to get 200hp.
15 more years and i can import the Ford Falcon i want😅
If I could ever find an unmolested IS300 manual transmission that could be my last car for edc and weekend track time. That NA I6, with some ITB’s full length headers, put all the cool carbon fiber body panelsz it seats 5, so it’s a great family car plus it’s a great alternative to a M5 from the same era, plus it will run forever without any major issues like the German cars.
The GR Yaris is a current car thats not availabe in the US.  Would be sweet to import one!
James, great video.  You and I are of similar age, so this era of cars are special to me.  I worked for a VW dealership in WA right out of high school (‘99-‘02).  It got me through community college before heading to a university to complete my degree.  I had an ‘84 GTI that I bought for $600 while working at the dealership.  I drove that when I went off to university and left my ‘71 Beetle convertible at home.  I put a ton of miles on it driving between school and home.  Thankfully it had factory cruise control with the 5-speed.  Sadly sold it after I got married and started a family.  We do still have my wife’s ‘89 Cabrio though, a great summer car, my teenage daughters love it.  Regarding the list, I would love to have the Clio and Lupo, wouldn’t oppose to the S3 either.  Love me some hot hatches.  Keep up the good work!
I fell in love with the Clio when I beat nfs most wanted using only that car.
Hey man, keep doing you
Love that these videos just feel like a nice relaxed chat with a homie
What is the song clip at the end of the video? losing my mind trying to find it lol
Learned to drive in and grew up with a 100hp 1.4L VW Lupo S and can confirm terrifying body roll when you pushed it and the float over 100mph was even more scary. But god was it a fun little car.
before the cars were revealed I was like "damn, not a single German car?" and then I was like "damn, I didn't realize there were that many Belgian cars!"
As someone who’s girlfriend owns a VW Lupo about that age… these cars are not fun. I mean her’s nominally has 80hp (not the 117hp) but if that car was driven at all over the last 20 years, you probably end up with about 70hp and be happy if you even make it to 60 m/h. It’s only saving grace is how damn cute they are.  Just get a ford fiesta st. I promise you, you’ll have a way better time with that
Probably should
Got to sit in a Pagani at Sema four years ago they really are incredible cars just the gauges in the interior is enough to distract a person
So what to you are saying is that all the cars we loved in Gran Turismo 1-3 are now available to buy. I don’t know about you but my list is long lol. K swap capachino, I’d love that special s2k that they drilled all those holes into the frame to make it way lighter, some of those Japanese performance collaborations like the Toms MR2, Mugen and Spoon Civic hatches, if I could find the custom Del Sol converted to mid engine and I think it was a v6, also those Lotus Elise Gen 1’s with the multiple little headlights, one of my favorites for the long tracks was the AMG E55 wagon.
Thanks bud. What a great video. I got in the feels from that, but I still think they're people (even engineers) working at these companies that push out cool products...... as long as these companies allow their engineers and designer's to express themselves through limited release, cool cars. I think the culture is there, but is being stamped out by corporate interests.   ..it's so easy... enstill innovation into engineers, have statistical oversight, but design minded-goal-driven leaders. Also l, have a good QC program that works along all categories of development.   Fuck yah, James. Keep it up bud.   I have an engineering degree and 10 years inspecting heavy civil construction. Hire me part time.
FINALLY! The Renault Clio v6 Sport can be imported, now if I only had a spare $80000 laying around to afford it.
Alternative title for those outside the USA: cars to buy before they skyrocket in value in 2025
I wonder if the Zonda C12 will have an "approachable" price point when they become eligible in 2027.
The timeline of cars jumping the shark is an emissions legislation timeline. And that's fine. I guess. As far as I know we don't have any spare planets, but if you make a timeline of automotive emissions requirements and bump it up against what the market qas doing at the time. It's an aha moment. And even if EVs are lacking in a certain je ne sais quoi there is no reason for body mods to go away. It's like clothes, for your car. Some scenes are almost entirely body mods and no engine changes at all.
Glad the channel has been doing well James & Co. , always loved the deep dives. Keep on, keeping on!
I love this guy. James, while you don’t know me. I consider you a friend, and more often than not you hit the point right on the head, this is one of those times. Everything is becoming so familiar and so Ingenuine… While it makes some things more convenient it makes other things lose their authenticity, the differences that make them unique. Stay different, brother, society has enough conformists
Once had a VW Lupo TDI as a company car. 71PS (similar to hp, never understood the difference) but it is such a fun car. Starts moving at 2000 rpm and then pulls every heavy car. Also very unstable car, so super scary if you don't update the suspension.
If James got you stoked on owning a Toyota Origin like me, check your desires. Only 1,073 were made. Fuck.
DId someone wrote about the flags yet ?
our family owned the yota estima back in early 00s!!!. it's a good "luxury" car for us considering we were moving up from mitsubishi colt at the time. its still hold a place in my heart even tho we owned it only for a bit before we change to a toyota alphard.
I love the Clio v6 rs soooo much I need that shit
Canadian here, you’re 10 years late
Put some bass in your voice when you talking about vans
I love you too.
There was one special TVR called the TVR Cerbera Speed 12 and it scared the owner of TVR so bad that HE, himself came in to work the next day after driving a Speed 12 home the night before said "NOPE" and cancelled the car and it never made it to production for Public use, I do believe a few made it to race tracks and the remaining "Road Going Homologation" versions were scrapped and used for spare parts for the rest of the racecars.
D D D D Dlist. 🎉🎉
The Belgium flag instead of the German flag is a nice touch of “comments magnet”, smart! 🫡
what chair are you sitting in?
SPEEED weeeeeee!
ngl not interested in cars that much but i love ur content
What happened to this guy’s energy? Is he hired something?
Kinda disappointed that he didn’t know the Holden is a Pontiac GTO
I was against anti convertible aside from the Mx-5 but when my buddy let me drift his turbo convertible fc rx7 I was sold.
Lmao, my buddy bought a solara because he thought it was a Silvia, he is a car guy but one of the car guys who bases what he likes off of what his buddies talk about.
The Cleo v6 was a cool car roaming our streets back in the day...SA gets the coolest cars FR
Oy mate... We need a hit of  POP-UP UP & DOWN HEADLIGHTS  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Love & respect from the land  down under
That clio is still one of my favorite cars in games and now that I know I can get one, well crap
Belgien und Deutschland sind zwei verschiedene Paar Schuhe! 🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪🇧🇪
I hope to import a 2nd gen 2door rav4! We never got them in the states
Yeeeesssss! Pumphrey and list of cars! 🎉🎉🎉 the timeline has in fact been corrected fellas
i saw this and my first thought was the clio
YOU BETTER KEEP MAKING VIDEOS FOR ALL OF US DAMIT
Australia is wrong way toilet flush America.
I’ve always wanted a Ute, so now I’m gonna save up and buy one!   Also, I couldn’t agree more on the ending. Everything seems so bland and meshed together. Nothing big is really creative anymore. People found what works and what majority of people want and continue to stick with it. It’s sad. Hopefully some spice happens and things go back to crazy new levels that blows everyone’s minds when they release, instead of “yep! Another product from our company that does the same thing the last one did, but with slightly more features that suck worse than our competitors, but you’ll buy it anyway!”
Bro I’ve been wanting a Renault Clio v6 since top gear
TVR upside down gives you a W
dont tell them about the crown athlete pleaase
You’ve got a reversed reg number on the thumbnail bro
The French said "What if we made Clio thiccc"
You guys can also get series 2 Ford AU falcons now (they also came in wagons)
I think car culture is essentially dead, I feel like people don't care about driving like they used to, it was a status thing, new and exciting and now it just seems like people find it a burden,  they take it for granted now, if every city had a good reliable public transit more people now would be into adopting that as a way to get around then deal with a big ugly complicated anxiety inducing potentially fatal monstrosity. People like shit done for them. Its a shame really the art is gone... For now anyway it'll come back it seems the youth right now has a bit of a taste for the old school more so then in the past maybe we'll see some genuine throw backs. 🤘🏿🦾🤪
Love you too, James.  Wise words on the motorcycle, and exactly why I don’t ride them.
I don't listen to guys from DONUT media they are a joke none of their cars ran for very  long.
Golf R32?
the rs4 avant makes me shiver my timbers
Nice video dad
FInally more cool French cars for you guys
12:30 Only over if you ignore the Australian car industry. Holden and Ford were making wholly unique muscle cars and utes on platforms we never got all the way up to the late 2010s.
Mk4 polo
Great vid! Keep up the good work James!
Skoda Diesel
babe wake up, a new speeed upload dropped
Can we just talk about how cool the Klein is in the background?
fun fact there is a Renault Clio V6 RS at the Lane Motor Museum in Nashville TN!
BMW 330 diesel (e46)
VW: Polo, Lupo
Audi A3/S3 (8L)
Renault Safrane V6
Hell yeah I can finally import my dream car. The pagani zonda. I'm asking my bank for a million dollar loan now. Lol
Can I get a Clio Williams?
I am so very happy that you are successful on this channel on your own. Donut is great, but if it kept you from reaching max potential the good for you.
NIssan Elgrand, the Z300 engine with the Skyline drive train in a van...
I am a big ute gal. Love me some utes 🫶
it  looks like he has been taking a lot  of  Ozempic  weight  loss pills
Ever since I watched Swordfish. The TVR Tuscan was added to my car bucklist
I really liked the edititing style of this video. Graphics made it easier for my brainrotted mind to follow along.
Song in background at 8:40
From now on there will be no German flags on this channel
That holden is one of the ugliest cara since the pontiac aztec 😂😂
Well there goes my chance on getting a audi s3
I love how most of these cars are wagons and hatchbacks haha
Can you make a follow up video how to legally own these cars in California!
Watch out for rust with the Mercedes Vito though. The first gen examples here in europe (that still exist) are mostly rotted out due to bad corrosion protection.
"Dark Matter" is good, but "Recursion" is better.
Italy always the best 🇭🇺
Another banger James
I like cars.
Thank you for not putting the vehicle I'd like to import on your list. 💜 I need it to stay cheep.
Love you're including Australian cars, but clearly you need to experience Australian car culture before you can say "other america." Love your other vids, but this one just doesn't do it for me
Personally I cannot support Volkswagen.their past with Nazi funding, carbon emissions scandals, and mostly meh products make me turn my head. Am I wrong?
Iff you take the 'vw lupo 3L'  it did 60 miles A gallon +/-
You Yanks should import AU Ford Falcons from Australia. Super cheap sedans that kick ass!
Australian cars are like GTA versions of American cars 😂
As a european who wants to own some of this cars, james we love u but don't help them take the cars away from us 😞
We get 2010's this year in Canada! I gotta Import a scirocco 1.4 manual before they shut down vehicle imports🙏🏻
Dude you gotta please bust out your suck BMW you built…. Would love to see what’s going on with it, even if it’s the same…. That thing is so gnarly and deserves an episode of its own!   Anyways much love from Detroit dude
I'm importing a my99 ver. VI STI right now from Japan. I can't wait for it to show up state-side.
2:35 made me spit my water out lol.
"if you cant afford a nissan skyline, here are some alternatives that are affordable" - "and here is the pagani zonda" !?!?!?
Like before the video even starts button ❤️‍🔥
Sick video but I gotta say, your editors KICK ASS. The pacing, graphics, sound design, music, EVERYTHING is perfect on these videos. Buy em some beers on me (I'm not paying but you get it).
Why you using the Belgium flag for German company? VW an Audi.
The Lupo GTI its a very great decision
@6:20 you might be mistaking this with TWR (Tom Walkinshaw Racing) which is a British company that built and tuned Jaguars, Astons, and Volvos. TVR indeed stands for TreVoR.
I love how misguided you are on TVR owners 😂 most aren’t gentleman racers or lords living in castles 😂 They’re working class people who made a bit of money and most really like a drink 😂 James you are more than cool enough for a TVR! In fact I’d go as far as to say you’d suit it, minus the drinking though you’d probably need a big bottle of whiskey afterwards if you ever drive it in the rain 😂
A yes Volkswagen and Opel from belgium
James, it's me, Christina Applegate, from the TV. sorry I was so mean b4, I forgive you now xoxo
OH SHYYYT THE ALTEZZA WAGON! Sorry for the all caps but I legit haven't thought about that car since 2006, and it was one of the first "forbidden fruits" I ever dreamed about. So sick. Memory is weird.
I didn’t know Belgium made so many of the cars I love
The Alteza gyat
Don’t forget lotus Elise s1
Man I love this so much... I can't even think of a comment that would make me cool enough to drive a Clio V6. Rock on brother.
2:20 I am! Let's 100% do exactly that.
The car #15 feels sooooo much like a car #1 in the list... 🙃
Lupo gti can finally be mine!!!
Gotta show some love for mah boy James. Representing from the 502
It's worth noting that basically all of these cars will likely shoot up in value the very instant they become legal to import into the US. Our market is full of hungry collectors waiting to get their hands on these things and it completely disrupts the supply and demand right away. A prime example of this happening is with the Lancia Delta Integrale EVO. For decades it hovered around $30k-40k equivalent in Europe and Asia, but as soon as it became US-legal, it skyrocketed to $70k-100k in no time. In other words, you gotta hop on these type of cars quick... or if you were lucky, you already had one lined up before its 25th birthday.
People with money to burn import cars. 😅 the headache of fixing something no one knows nothing about is unappealing to most of us. No parts. Everything has to be ordered. And if you don't work on cars 😂 good luck with that.
Skeleton crew was good
What happened to the other format with you sitting in front of of the book shelf?
Christmas Day around 2006/2007 my Dad’s cousin owned a V6 Clio II and took me for a blast down the East Lancashire road… I’ve loved that car ever since, absolute animal of a thing and it was soooo fast! Sounded glorious too with that V6 right behind you 😃
Ayo james mentioning Ibizas in the video now needs to go to a "meet" in Portugal and Spain to see what they're all about 😂
Great video, but it could have ended in the first minute, the Renault Clio V6 is the king.
Happy to see the Commodore 😍 Always wanted the ute growing up
Thanks for staying on YouTube James
Clio!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I subscribed
I love this video
Sick chair James
Loving the upload James, keep this shit cooking!
Globalization baby. It has its pros and cons. Unfortunately [some of] the cons are loss of jobs and creativity in the strive for efficiency and making every penny possible
As a half Belgian half German i noticed you used the Belgian flag and not the German flag, I’m not mad about it
I've never read any of the other books, but Dark Matter is very good.  Also, I'd suggest "The Unincorporated Man"  Exceptionally good book.
im legit psyched for the fancy wagons hitting the states, i always wanted one but even now i doubt could afford, so id love to see an imported second hand one for a cheaper price 😭
the last of interesting jdm cars.
19:38 I think that is the Pagani C12
I rode in a Lupo with a fat chick and it was cramped
The fact that he said it looks like a shoe and not the ford mystic paint.... let's me know all I need to know.
I agree, this is probably the last wave of really interesting things to be available to import.
In my opinion, Holden is Underatted
just use the EU flag🇪🇺
Very nice video
Just waiting to import a '08 Scirocco.
You're just a Rad dude man.....really love your work bruh
Alfa GTV V6❤
@22:08 we love you too my Guy!
Ooooh speed books... yay id rather not watch a video
The cars that are on the list are cool
The TVR car was in the movie swordfish!!!    How can you not like that car?!  You see John Travolta shooting machine gun from the passenger seat in that car!
TVR the W is upside down?
Germans say every country has its own kind of speed bump. Theirs is Belgium
:)
Greta video my guy! My top on this list would have to be CLio V6 i have always loved them, awesome look to them. Not to mention great car to use in GT or Forza 😁
Been following you for many years now. I love the new channel. You give older brother vibes and it’s very wholesome
This is so well done man! Thank you for continuing to put out car content with true passion behind it
please do this every single year
Speeeeeeeeeed
Loving living in Canada cuz I’ve seen most of these cars at car shows here
Crazy that in Australia, we got the B4 RS4 Avant but you Americans didn't. In fact, alot of the cars mentioned in this video we have here in Australia, or were imported as grey market imports.
Nobody should be spending 10k+ on a 20+ year old car... When theyre basically junkers anyway and in no form collectable conditions... Stop this shit.
It would have been cool to put at least one or 2 4x4 trucks on here. There are some good ones out there.
He's back boys!!!!
HELL yeah. A Clio has been one of my dream cars forever but nobody knows how cool they are!!
NGL, i never knew about the S15 convertible until now!
The Lexus LBX Morizo rr will be a forbidden fruit one day. Basically a GR Yaris, but tis a lexus.
Your German flags are Belgian - jus' sayin'.
feels like the homogenization of anything and everything is gonna collapse inward, just like my brain if we keep this up, anyway luh you forever Jameson J Ponderosa
James, stop, I want these weird quirky car to be still affordable😭
I thought the Zonda was available in the USA?
Just to add on the Holden pick, if RHD isn't something you're interested in. They were also sold in LHD as a Chevy Lumina here in the middle east, as well as the Chevy Caprice (rebadged Holden Statesman) which looks dope in the SS trim imo.
Don't Forget the Renault Clio 2.0 16v 172 (The sister to the V6)
wait for james to find about the octavia vrs wagon, an slightly enlarged golf 4 4motion with the same beloved 1.8T 20v
Out of this list, the RS4 would be my pick. But I have a thing for Audi's. I daily a B5, plus own a B6 and B8 too.
Your forgetting the rare four door crew cab ford ranger 😢😂
Is it just me, or does the Holden HSV look a lot like an Opel Omega-B?   Considering they are both GM brands, I'd say they are prolly the same platform. If anyone can confirm, please do 🤩  - Never mind, i got it figured out  Turns out I was correct, they are both a GM V platform (also known as the "V-Car" platform)
You dont have 250,000 bucks bro? But your in my forza game, and that other dookie game, wow! Well gg on still.......going, i would still import a mk 1 golf rhd, i dont really like skylines....
Fantastic video
Where'd you get that chair sir? 👀
This is coming from a place of love and concern, so please hear me our: it's extremely disorienting to hear people from the US talking about our euro grocery-trolleys like they're something special, just to realize that they indeed are. When you ask a western European what American car they would like to own, 90% of the time the answer is either the hero- or the villain-car from Bullitt. That's when you realize that the once glorious automotive monolith of "American muscle" withered away in the age of the moon landing, only to be replaced by sloppy and obsolete engineering marketed by suits as the next big thing.  My honest and sincere question is: why don't you vote out the people upholding these import limitations?
An R34 GTR is not 250k unless you are getting a rare spec. Why do all these YouTube’s continue to say this shit.   You can literally pick one up in Japan instead from great sources between 90-120k shipped. Ask me how I know…
12:36 you say that but there's a Suzuki Jimny and Citroen C3 Cactus that aren't in the US of A. The world still has automotive forbidden fruit
The one car ive always wanted on your list is a Holden UTE.     It's a crime we never got them here.
Damn Belgium made some really cool cars!
cool
11:25 IS THAT A CUPRA?!
Trevor Wilkinson might of been from Germany before coming to England. That would explain why the W is a V because you pronounce W as V in German
I didnt expect you to have a road bike! Thought you were more of a mtber or bmxer sorta dude
This guy is talking about how "not cool" he is all the while he is rocking a pearl necklace.
Also ya can drop some big engine swaps in the lupo GTIs
That is funny to watch as a European because most of those cars are beaters here now
11:31 the Ibiza is a Polo platform, the one based on the Golf is the Seat Leon. MK4 all.
Is this a shill channel for Donut?
so all the cool cars are actually from Belgium? mind blown
1:15 Renault Clio V6 3:24 Nissan Silvia S15 Varietta 4:48 Volkswagen Lupo GTI 6:03 TVR Tuscan Speed 6 7:50 Audi RS4 Avant 10:21 Audi S3 11:25 Seat Cupra 4 13:16 Toyota Altezza Gita 14:21 Toyota Estima 15:25 Toyota JZX110 16:08 Toyota Origin 16:35 Holden HSV VX Clubsport 17:38 Opel Speedster 18:15 Noble M12 19:22 Pagani Zonda
You said my name like 8 times and that gave me dopamine for some reason
You can import Holden Ute’s now any year doesn’t have to be 25 years old
I would like to import a 2000 4Motion VR6 Bora
I used to want a Clio
I really want one of those Silvia convertibles!
WHAT ABOUT UK FORD Cosworth CAR'S
Hey James can you import a 2020 Brazilian made Hyundai hb20 e and modify the hell out of it
17:00 g8? GTO? SS?
Really digging that chair...looks super comfy
Its such an odd feeling watching all the brand-new, top-of-the-line sports cars from the videogames I was playing back in 2000 become retros and classics from a bygone era of automotive design.
You need to re-assess your channel. Not doing great and it’s all over the place
My american friends, most of this cars where and are sold in Mexico. Cross the border and buy them new or used.
I was glad to see my homie have a beautiful widebody S15 for sale on his lot.  They've had a few R34's so far but none were a GTR. They're cool and all but I was more excited to see the S15 than I was his first R34 on the lot
This was a quality video. Thank you.
Learned a ton this video, like always. Thanks!
Au falcon from Australia
I am today years old when I found out that the freakin S15 had a CONVERTIBLE version. It's a 5 hands down.
James, we need deets on that chair. It looks comfy.
No one ever mentions right away renault clio v6 is expensive 50k and need for speed most wanted has it super cool car
why is the german Flag wrong?
Honorable mentions to add to this list would be the first gen lotus elise/exige and the lotus carlton. Also the ford escort cosworth but these are all probably gonna go up in pricing as i comment this. Grab em while they're still somewhat affordable.
jzs171 is goated and so clean
James, my man. You know about the lupo, ibiza and the speedster, damn you did your homework. But no audi station rs2 .😢
As german i can say we make the best french fries
Day 6 I think of asking for up to speed on Kimi Raikkonen
2:24 the car pictured as the clioV6 predecessor is a renault 5 GT turbo mk1, the mk2 was front engine not mid, and definitely not a renault turbo 2, just to get facts straight
belgium was like: huh since when we made cars?
Clio V6, never clicked so fast
Good video
S15 is definitely the one, though I do like GTR r34s like everyone else
I just want a mini golf now, its so funky how tiny cars were back then, not just that. They were tiny, low power, and somehow rally monsters. Mini Coopers, Beetles, golfs.
Soon you will be able to import the early 2000s VAG cars with the different diesel engines to what the US. These engines are a lot more tuneable and are popular amongst broke boy racers in Europe.
I have a friend that has a 700whp seat ibiza that has a 1.8L TSI engine and this is like the norm that people get out of that engine like istg people in my country swap this engine into anything and the most powerful car that we have here is a base model golf 6 that pushes 1700 WHP OUT OF A 1.8 LITER
Renault V6 is spot on and quite the looker! Can't wait for a collab with Big Time!
It’s finally 25 years from a bunch of cars we actually want!
If any of you need a Seat Ibiza just buy them from Spain, we have lots of these, that's like the most common car here
Way better than Donuts podcast list, where they brought up 3 cars... I still love those guys, but content has been shit since James left
keep your head up shirts?
Nice thing about Audi is how modular their platforms are. You could get a B6 Audi a4 or s4 Avant for like 10k (its gotta be the 30 valve 3.0 v6); get the 2.7TT v6 from a C5 Audi a6 for 2-3k; along with some other few things you could build yourself a RS4 Avant on a budget, save 20-40k to put towards other things like maintenance. Sure you wont get things like the VIN matching RS4 or RHD; but things like manual swap and AWD are possible with stock drivetrain and not a large amount of modification to things like computer.
Isnt the opal speedster the same as the Pontiac Solstice or Saturn Sky.
Are Renualts still garbage and terrible to repair and maintain?
It’s almost like you knew when I’d get off work :)
tuff polo gang
Viewer engagement!
The clio V6 has been my dream car since i first new of it
tvr grifith????? finallllyyyy
PLEASE SOMEONE SUPPORT THE ARTIST IN THE OUTRO, THE SONG IS AMAZING AND SHE BARELY HAS ANY FOLLOWERS OR LISTENERS. Her name is Hennie hun, and the song is titled, "white sheets"
My mom’s neighbor in Texas has an early Clio V6, genuinely blew my mind when I first saw it here a couple years ago. Guessing he got it in under show and display
Finally back to a car video on this channel
Tvr and toyota origin are the only 2 cars id get.
Is that a donut mic?
I love the new shirt, but 30 euros for shipping is just as much as for the shirt:( How can i get it to Amsterdam for less!?❤️🇳🇱
Love this!  More car stuffs!!!
Sign me up for the Holden Ute or Opel Speedster for an awesome commuter!
Do Colombia
that renault clio v6 its like 65.000 to 80.000 $ not 40000$
Nice microphone.....  will they want some of the ad revenue?
Tip on the lupo gti. It might be legal, but in there uk there is only 3 on a year 2000. Better waiting for next year
TVR? You wanna die??
Love you too James!
was gooood Pumphrey???
Discord link working for anyone?
Damn, those last he said hit hard.
The Belgian flag tho :D :D :D
he know we manly showing up for the car vids
Driving Vauxhall VX220 on NFS Hot Pursuit 2 PC growing up. Man I want one.
8:40 Phillip kaess build a sedan version of this Rs4
What if… you don’t import our cool cars to the USA? They are rare enough in Europe, and it’s not our fault that you don’t get the cool hothatch or Station Wagons we make, it’s what your market choses or your government that makes it impossible to buy there when in production. Not our fault that American cars suck, you almost just sell the cars you make in the USA and Canada while European and Asian cars sell all around the world.
you are using the Belgian flag for the German cars mate, Germany has the same flag but horizontal stripes
When referring to the Lubo, you confused the Belgian banner with the German. Regardless, all the  love on the world to you.
make more videos!!!
Bora is jot a eu jetta. We have bora, jetta and wento here…
Forget all those cars, I still want your chair.
I cheated....and moved to Germany. 😂
Lots of cool cars and trucks are only available with diesel engines overseas. So we at least have that to look forward to every year
James that use other America gto
Sucks that there isn’t much personality to a lot of things any more. Houses having “modern looks”, cars looking all the same, or like you said even clothes nowadays seems to not have much personality. Everything is being built for revenue gain strictly which I understand. Costs a lot of money to go out on a limb and try something new. May we somehow get back to that way.
in a few year you'll be able to import the MG XPower SV-R ^^
This video made me sad and fall to ethernal depresion, thanks James :D
If you want to die quickly, get a Clio V6. They look extremely cool, but apparently are absolute hogs to drive.
My personal pick as an American is a 2000 Ford Falcon TS50 (T3). Badass hand-built 5.6 Windsor V8 stroker,  MOMO steering wheel, Brembo brakes, Stout Tremec TR-3650 5-speed manual, and not to mention that body kit
I remember being a kid playing gran turismo and seeing so many of these.  So it's rad to see so many of these available for import.  Sadly the cost to import them appears to be crazy.  Who knows though?  Love this stuff man, great content.
Honda accord ch1 type R (3000 examples or so in rhd or lhd) first 2 years too!
Clio, S3 and rs4 for The Win
I was watching fun cars then all of sudden I find myself thinking deep stuff, that was a good final for the video man. I love it
as a 10+ year owner of a B5 S4... just dont. you will get no love from the car or from audi, and you will need a second mortgage to have it repaired. oh and forget about getting parts from audi.
12:31 GM is a prime example of this, if it wasn’t for Saturn or Buick we wouldn’t have opels or vuaxhalls in the USA
Skinny Donut media without the donut is kinda weird, not gonna lie. If you did it for your health then amazing but if it was because of all the corporate BS then im so sorry. You lost the weight and now step 2, the actual gym. Your head is almost 3 times too big for your now skinny shoulders and frame. Just pause immediately at 0:02. Everyone in highschool wanted to kick this dude's ace. When was the last time you saw the sun daywalker?
Is this where my Crown estate Athlete V shoots up on value
@james… where did you get that polo shirt? I like it
1 like for foamposite reference
Lupo GTI fans unite!
Just keep up James, and for god sake just ride a bike ... You had one life trial already use this second chance to live
New Speeed?? on my birthday??? LFG.
Dear Americans, please dont buy our VX2000's, terrible cars, like really bad ....... OK i'm lying but they're already hard enough to find for us.
Time to fire the graphics dude, using the Belgium flag for German cars.
Bought my GT-R in 2016 cause i'm Canadian.
I like that Origin a lot, nice old school look
get the flags in order;-) Belgium / Germany wtf?
You can still get an r34 gtr for "only" 150k
"250 k r34 is more expensive to import than 7 million dollar pagani zonda which is affordable " don't really get that?
As a French person driving a 2003 clio 2 I didn’t expect to be attacked like that. Anyway, I surrender.
I don't like audis, because when your saloon radiator is leaking then fixing it means tearing down whole dashboard. Or else you have foggy front window all the time. Leaking radiator in audi basicly made my car worthless.
TVRs are driven by the British equivalency of a redneck, you can absolutely pull one off
CLIO V6!!!
i’m guessing now the trick is to put incorrect shit in the video so people comment. i’m sure you know that’s Belgium’s flag.
You should make a video about “the best engine from each manufacturer”
Spot on the CKY Audi 💙
Whoa! Never expected to see our footage in one of your videos, stoked that you’ve seen our stuff.   Awesome video James, love what you’ve been doing with Speeed. Enjoy the new JDM cars! ❤
I never knew I actually wanted one of those big fast Japanese sedans till just now
VW is belgian for tax reasons I guess
Today I learned that Belgium has a lot of automotive industry. 🤔
15:25 bruh that's not a JZX110. That's a Crown.
Another great video always appreciate seeing you in front of the camera yapping about things you find interesting and you have passion to get people excited about cool cars and even product we have lost excitement and gratitude for. Thank you for being a genuine human.
Man I had 3 ST162 Celicas 147 BHP at the wheels with the 3S-GE with no rev limiter. My engine went to 7,500 all day [ red line 6,500 ] used a little oil without smoke until hardest throttle. Ended up illegal street racing in it's 3rd car @ 160,000 miles!!!
Clio V6 is so damn wild, it's a damn Renault Clio, but they stuffed a V6 into it, made it mid-engine and didn't elaborate further.   Opel Speedster was extremely underappreciated when it came out, since Opel always had some problems selling their cars, they still make cars, but they largely disappeared since they got sold several times. The most wild car they made is the Opel Astra G OPC Xtreme, basically they took their DTM car and made it road legal.   Also, Opel Calibra, really awesome car, should have a look at those as well.   And so, a meme was born, Belgian flag instead of the German, from this point we complain when they use the actual German flag instead of the Belgian flag.
This channel after the spin off has been a significant surprise. Super well done videos and research. I know there is a ton behind the scenes. It’s very much appreciated. Keep up the good work.
Ah I missed the accents and acting
New d list?
I had a factory awd 2jzge altezza gita with a 4 speed auto in the states, super rare, but super cool but sucked on gas
Dammit. I wanted that 2-door A3 the day it came out. (I mean, I've got a 2017 manual Golf "Wolfsburg Edition", that must be superior in all respects except how many axles are driven, but still…)
Audi S3 being described as 'exotic' is so funny. No one would bat an eye in Europe.
13:02 idk man i think they were hotter on a particular day in 1945 🇺🇸🦅
I've only ever heard of SEAT in video games and was jealous that Renault didn't sell cars in the US (again, video games showed how cool they were; I'd get a Cilo).  Nice to know I can finally get my hands on one, finances pending of course.
Knew the first one just by the silhouette.
Couple more years and you guys can import the Aussie XR6 turbo falcons, ive got one in Canada 🎉
The Opel Speedster actually is a Lotus Elise Mk2 Chassis with Opel hardware, or as you will, a Tesla Roadster with ICE. And you will fit in it, James, these offer a lot of room for tall people.
Mu Bro spent time working on TVR's computers, he hung out with the owners on, got hammered with him.  There was the 'family Range Rover' had a 3.5 from a '350'' engine in it!!!!
Why there is no old Evo??  Quote from google: "Like all other Lancer EVO generations before it, the sixth generation was never sold in the U.S. market, but in 2024, this Japanese pocket rocket turns 25 years old, and this means you can finally import it, and get yourself a piece of Japanese rally heritage with one of the most powerful inline-four engines ever built..." Do 'muricans even know they exist? Like, the Evo 6 is one of the best driving machines existing to this day😅
Supposed the 8l S3 is on here. Very cool car.
renault sport clio v6 my beloved
6N is the polo chassis, Lupo GTi is 6Es and the normal Lupo is 6X (Lupo 3L is 6E). Shame it gets confused with the polo chassis designation
Very, very cool! But Dude, thats not the german flag… 😉 🇩🇪 I‘m pretty sure the Seat Ibiza was Polo based.
What was that song at the end?
Just remember, you may not be like that lucky guy from the Military that just wanted and brought a R34 GTR instead of wanting to protecting the country in which he can actually afford one, you are like Jimmy, James and I, and we can go to a step closer to importing a cool car that is not a R34 but we can still say "its a IMPORT"! haha. Regardless from the U.s or japan, just make sure you get a car you can afford.
The Sylvia Varietta Niceeee
why do you use Belgian flag when talking about German cars... like the correct flag should be the bear minimum... Its just of putting. Kinda like if you had smudge on your shirt
Dude the Clio V6 is a pocket rocket. I love small fast cars, it's like driving a go-kart. Who doesn't like go-karts?
6:59 still Insane
That's wild I didn't realize Riley weighed 2000 pounds
TBH had I known I could have imported a Holden UTE this year I might not have gotten an El Camino a few months ago
So we can all agree that hi vs. low was weird af without James and the lack of support from his dad.
CKY reference?! Very impressive! Not many people have seen those skate videos.
Two more years and you guys can get Barras!
11:25 I have to correct you on that one James: the car you’re showing is an Ibiza, which never had 4WD. The Ibiza was the SEAT variant of the Polo, not the Golf 11:33: that is a Leon Cupra R, which was based on the A3 8L platform (yes, the A3 was the first car on that platform, beating the Golf mkIV by a year). The Leon Cupra R had the same BAM engine as the S3 only it came with FWD only. There were Haldex 4WD variants of the Leon, one with the 180HP 1.8 20vT (AUQ) and the actual Leon Cupra4 had the 2.8VR6 with 201 hrsprs. SEAT had to drop the “4” moniker as that’s what Porsche was using for their 4WD models.  Had to correct you on that one, the Leon Cupra R is one of my favourite cars, and it put the GTI to shame. Mk1 LCR still had mo powa babeh than the Mk5 GTI.
Dude, that's the Belgian flag. But I see from the comments that you've already been told that...ah! But you're the same guy who said that Ducati was built in the time of communism, in Italy, communism, NATO founding nation. Big thumbs up.
I'm loving the new D-List, or should we call it the Speeed-List
is it just me or does speeed have amazing editing, jaw dropping visuals? gotta hand it to the editor, i hope they were mentioned in the description.
That clio. My gran turismo 1/2 youth can finally become a reality. I mean, it won't...but it can
I KNOW PAGINI WAS LOW VOLUME SO IT WAS IMPORTED  but i love the first set!
I just wanna say I appreciate the subtitles hella. It always shows when someone puts in the extra effort that just makes these vids so good.
dude i was like “wait belgium makes cars??”
The toughest part about importing a car to California is having to pay the CARB
yeah sure but i’m importing a suzuki jimny ja22 turbocharged and that’s way cooler than any of this shit
I miss the hrspr🥲
And the prices went up. Thanks dad
To your point at the end, cars suck now, they all have kill switches and can be shut off remotely. Never getting anything newer than 2012, and in very few cases 2014.  Whipping a 00' avalon slammed as my daily with 150k miles C5 Z06 is my track car with 80K  I dont think ill ever need to buy another car (unless i keep leaving it in instead of pulling out)
The Clio V6 you showed in the video, is the facelift version that came out in 2003.  The original version from 2000 has different headlights and 25 horsepower less.
In Canada we got the 15 year rule rather then 25 and basically the only thing companies up here import are vans now which is cool but cars are way cooler
Buying a 25 year old Audi from URope will surely lead you to financial ruin and be the next guest on financial audit with Caleb :D
So my man J to the P releases a new video, it slaps harder than The Beatles, so yeah, we all happy
As a German, mad respect to The Belgians for pumping out so many cool cars
Damn, VAG has gotta start building cars in Belgium again.
Germium
8:04 if that’s the gas station I think it is, that dude is a jerk
Wait...so they made the Opel GT with the same engine which mimics the Pontiac Solstice/ Saturn Sky but then made an even cooler body style and called it the Opel Speedster? Damn...we missed out!
Fantastic list, but question. Could I convert my 2014 Jetta to awd?
You are absolutely right.
Already secured my JZX110 Mark II IR-V 1JZGTE for the USA 🇺🇲
Are you not allowed to collaborate or be around  cars in person as agreements with leaving donut?? Sorry but endless lists videos while talking swiveling in a chair isn't gonna cut it. You better get your butt out  doing projects.
An alternative to the Altezza Wagon is the Fielder (Corolla) wagon that came with the same 2zzge and 6spd as the last gen Celica. Only weighs 1150kgs (less than a Porsche Boxster) and makes 182hp.
Pls get clio v6
Tvr logo upside down the V looks like a W 🎉
Germany 🇩🇪  Belgium 🇧🇪   The colors aren’t even in the same order.  How can you mess it up?  At least look it up before editing the video. 😂
Toyota chaser x100 series 1996–2001 with turbo 1JZ or 2JZ non-turbo on manual 5 speed is the one
RSW VS M5 video
Yes sir 🎉
What’s up James !!’
everything merged because of capitalism.   profit over everything and everyone 🤷🏽‍♀
beligan vw 🔥
Only one of these gets rated a 0 (but fr man?!)
Love the comment bait with the belgium flag. Well played
good list , but WHAT s15 convertable !
This list is missing the Lotus Exige S1. Definitely should have been included!
I had an is300 and loved it but I wanted to get an Altezza/RS200 so I could swap all the jdm parts to my LHD cuz I cannot stand driving rhd. I'm a left handed person, lhd is better for me haha
Why is there this 25 year rule 😅
The Cleo is cool 👍
Guys, you made a mistake. You put the Belgian flag instead of the German flag… 😅
I'm not a big car guy. Can someone explain why these cars couldn't be imported when they were first manufactured?
The Renault Clio V6 the first time driving it was on NFS Carbon it was a car out of hell
What are some good european import companies to work with?
The closing of the last two videos almost has me in tears
I remember Real Racing 3 on Mobile, made you use a Renault Clio V6 when you started out. I fell in love with that thing, it's absolutely badass. Love the giant vent on the side and the wide body.  Didn't even realize you couldn't get one until now. Damn, now I need one.
No offense but you look as terrible as I do being skinny
As a european watching a bunch of videos about cool american cars we don't have here, this felt like a parallel universe. My two older brothers had Lupo and Audi RS4 as their first cars. Both were happy to upgrade to something more reliable 😂
The car you showed in profile and the magazine cover is the Ibiza wich is based on the VW Polo and didnt come AWD the Leon Cupra did come in awd and was based on the Golf/Audi A3. The Cupra R however had the same 225hp 1.8t as the S3 but FWD. The awd Cupra was a 2.8l 24v vr6 or in the uk also 1.8t 180hp. Although there is also a regular 1.8t and 1.9tdi leon wich were available in awd but those were no cupras
Why do you have Belgian flags next to the German cars?
Thank god that James is giving us the OG Donut Media content we want when Donut refuses to do so!
Lotus Elise Series 1.
The Clio V6 RS i have a fun story of that car my dad actually had a 2005 one that he bought for like 5000 USD in like 2011 (this was in Mexico), he only bought it because his cars got totalled and needed something to move that was cheap but not a total shitbox for like a year, so he found it ona newspaper and bought it, and it was a cool car fast and it drive well, but man it had problems mostly with the oil and the filters, maybe that's why it was 5000 USD, after a year when the car car loan that his job gave every 4 years was available he actually sold it for profit to some guy that really wanted it for around 7000 USD, and he bought a boring ass CX7.
As a millionaire watching this thanks for the advice on the pagani 😂
Another Vin & James day 🙌🏻
Sad you didnt mention the Alfa Romeo 156 GTA Wagon😞
Love ya to brohan.
Book club let's go!   Also, we have a couple more years... 2027 is the year we can finally import the 2002 Ford Focus RS!
Man I love this channel so much, sending love and light from South Africa, James! 🔥♥️
DON'T TELL NORMIES ABOUT THE ORIGIN OR PROGRES.
All this mk4 Volkswagen love and not even a mention of my fave, the New Beetle RSi!?😩  I've always felt like it was kind of the Camaro SS to the Clio V6's Mustang GT... Or the other way around??? Either way they're two cars I've always paired together. :P (Then later on we got the Focus RS and Mini GP R53...)  Another car I'd have personally put on my list is the Vitz RS Turbo though I'm not 100% sure if that was a 2000 release or a little later.
You did forget 1 special car.  The Mitsubishi evo 6.5 is now available and the prices are going up. Most are 2000 models.
As always, I loved this video. You’re a true creative and great storyteller.
This friggin auto ai conversion into german sucks...first I want to keep in Touch with other languages...second they gave you a female voice in german
I feel like Gran Turismo in the 90's trained us for this video.
the Speedster may be powered by a Cobalt engine, but they make 260hrsprs and torques at 15psi. bump it up to 23 and itll still be reliable enough to daily and be making roughly 300hrsprs (from what my butt dyno said in my old cobalt ss). its like an SW20 MR2 built with a mix American brute force and German precision, depending on how much the Germans designed the chassis
Toyota Crown Wagon 🤤👌🏻
The RS4 Avant has been on my bucket list for a long ass time now. Going to be trying to get one in the next few months.
Its funny how we used to think cars were getting too "cookie-cutterish" back in the late 90s.  We had no clue what the 2020's had in store.
The reno v6 from gran turismo? NAH I think you mean the very based NEED FOR SPEED CARBON
Good to know I’m not the only one who’s hope for the future of cars is dwindling
Speeeeeeeedddddd
Still want a manual sti forester blue with gold bbs wheels… I know it’s the common color, but it’s the one I want… to have that parked next to a 22b gc8 would be sick
For a LHD clio v6 you're off by like 40k $
I have $2 what can i buy
great video!
Quick correction, you cannot get an Altezza Gita with a 3sge beams engine, the 2.0 Gita (AS200) is a 1G-FE 6cyl engine with 160bhp, the 3SGE 4cyl only came in the RS200 Altezza Saloon.
Trevor:TVR::Horsepower:hrsprs
Love the video. The last 2 min when you got real… what a great way of saying it!
its ALMOST like ur biased toward VW lol
Wasn't the TVR Tuscan what John Travolta drove in the movie Swordfish?
Did you know you can get the Mercedes vito as a VR6?
Maybe one day, I'll be able to get a 2010 Focus RS in the US....
Very cool video! Thanks, greetings from Slovakia :) BTW, Skoda (another brand from the VW Group) has some cool cars too, look in to it :) Keep it up
This is a great list and I wouldn't change it, but your VW fanboy was showing a little bit too hard.
I love my 2001 A4 and definitely want to pick up a 2001 RS4
Another banger
vito from sopranos had so much aura they named a car after him, sick
import one to california n youll have to spend another 15k + to register it :( learned the hard way pre covid lol
I own an 2003 is300 and the Toyota Altezza with the Beams engine is like my DREAM
I was waiting for Alfa Romeo 156 GTA with V6 Busso... but it came out in 2001
Here are some other interesting cars that are very rare in the US: Škoda Octavia RS Opel Astra OPC Volvo 850R Renault Mégane Suzuki Jimny
Cars being a different way back then versus cars now is starting to be a bad thing.
My god I hate Americans thinking Australia is just a small version of America. We are not.
I still wait the day I can have a Honda S660, sooo cool
🇧🇪 = 😂
We still have some cool cars to look forward to in the future. Like the Ford Falcon in Australia. Specifically the XR6
You, Jobie, and Jerry need to partner up on videos pleaaasse
Me thinking wow no german cars in there and I didn’t know belgiums made cool cars okay! Then seeing hes just a normal American, not knowing flags and cant be bothered googling them lol
❤❤❤❤ I love this s**t Mr. Pumphrey!!!! Keep going! And that donut mic 🤡✌️🤩👌👌👌👌
LUPO MENTIONED, BASED
Might have to buy a zonda
It was pretty cool to see a Zonda on this list!
The Vito also came out with a vr6
HRSPR
🧑🏾‍💻 but what's next
Love you james but you will mever convince me a Volkswagen is a good investment 😂
Love it James.  I also thought the Zonda was in America.
SPEEEEEEEDDSSS
Lmao the RS4 is so sick, but normal people(not into 2.7t) will not do the maintenance it requires... They're a lot, my Allroad is fun but also I have had to work on it a bunch
I want a hilux so bad dude
Yes more car content!
This one hits the feels. I hate having to use a computer to even glance at my car.  There's nothing like having to break out the 32mm wrench to get the fan off the M3.
We are only 8 years away from getting the most talked about car on Top Gear. the grand Dacia Sandero
I think we should vote to over turn the 25 year law and change it to a 10 year but the car I Wana import is the VW Scirocco 2015
You have mixed the seat Ibiza Cupra and the seat Leon Cupra, they are two different size cars. The Ibiza was something between a polo and a golf, and the Leon was like a golf.
get ready for these cars to suddenly inflate lol
I dig the vibes of this channel and this video I was never hardcore into Donut like many others were, but it's very clear you were one of the souls of that channel. I'm a fan, keep up the great work.
Stay safe out there.
That’s a hard ass shirt James
I still remember using the gear ratio from 6 speed transmission's in the Summit Mail order catalog on Gran Turismo back in the day...Ty Richmond
Now do it with foreign trucks. So many more options over seas.
Solid point about less cars people will want to import. Never Ever though of that!! Great content as is tradition.
TVR Tuscan was featured in the movie 'Swordfish' with John Travolta, Halle Berry, and some newcomer named Hugh Jackman.
James in the chair is so cute
i need a clio v6 in my life
Not a bad list at all, the only thing I don't agree with.... we don't need any more convertible s-chassis shitboxes. S13 verts are already a copium car because all the clean coupes have been drift missiled or otherwise ruined
For you Americans, if you want a budget Clio, you can still get any of the 172/182's and they're still fun to drive!
This man just upped the prices on imports 😭😭
Cupra and s3: when you want a mkIV but don’t want to be a PA dubber
Australian cars have always just looked to me like the Burnout version of other cars. haha
Can we get a garage tour?
Pretty sure the 6N is a polo...
Hi James and Jesse. Thank you for one more awesome video.
Cool video. I'm glad you're taking on different things and trying new avenues of approach for your content. I'm here for it man. Keep it going.
I never imagined there would be anyone else in the US who wanted a V6 Clio. It’s one of my favorite cars.
Holden looks like GTA version of Pontiac lol
8:08 the price of gas is unreal
Project Hail Mary is so good! Dark Matter is overrated imo tho. It's really just a junk food book
Insert Canada with the 15 year regulation instead of 25 like US 😎
Audi S3 is not handsome. Right there with the 3 series hatchback
I love all of these cool odd cars. Thanks for introducing me to a bunch I had never heard of. The rear engine hatchback is wild!
Someone should be crazy enough and a super fan to import a Hindustan Motors Ambassador car to North America🥲 James, please check that car out. It's from India and built like a tank
now THIS IS WHAT WE WANNA SEE
No mention of the Toyota BB open deck?!?
James brother, youre killing me. A Holden is on the list, but no Ford? Daddy needs his Falcon!
This is what I wanna get up to speeed on! This felt like nostalgic actually. You look comfy and at home
Bro, ShiftHaven Podcast just talked about the same thing, that's crazy!
you said hrsprrr and my heart fluttered! Love your channel dude!
The clio aged so well it's insane. I did not know these cars were 25 years old. I would have guessed 2013 based on styling 😂
I know germans love to invade Belgium as soon as they have an opportunity but at the time of this video it's not the case. (but it could have changed whenever you are watching it)
11:11 we also have Jettas in Europe...
it's awesome to finally see James talking about cars again
Damn James you put me on to white sheets. It's a great song
The Clio is the only *not utter trash* car the French have ever made. 😂
James looks like your weird uncle that has a weird smelling house.
The pink tip mic was a eye soar
I’ve never heard of the TVR, and I’m into it.
in canada the import birthday is 15 years not 25. that being said, ive seen 1 Varietta. at the time had no idea that version existed. super cool nissan
I 100% see what you mean by all cars after 2000 using the same platform up here in Canada, we’ve had all these super cool cars, but now the biggest imports from Japan is 2is’s and g35/37’s that are just RHD, kind of kills the fun of that unattainable hero cars we never got growing up
keep your head up bro, we still have dreams, and the people who dont let AI take over ther thinking for them will be able to set those drerams apart from this condensed ,souless trash produced by committee
No.1 is a car I’ve dreamed about since I was a wee lad.
So nice to live in Canada, we can import 15 year old cars. So nice to live in a country with WAY more freedom than the USA will EVER have.
cool cars"""""""""!""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hi
Too bad they only made that Audi in a station wagon, and the s15 looks ugly as a convertible
Former Clio V6 mkii owner here, it was cool at the time, but I don't think I'd do it again. I was living in Belgium and sold it to come back to the US.
banger episode
Ur killin it man, good for u, hope ur enjoying ur work, keep it up
I swear to God, if this video makes it to where I can't justify buying a Clio v6, ill riot
00:04:52 Never knew that Volkswagen comes from Belgium. ;)
James. You used the wrong flag on the lupo gti. You used the belgium🇧🇪 flag not the german.🇩🇪
The Twingo 2 RS should have been on that list 😁
Good to see you
Hey Boss, do a top 10 longest lasting, most reliable winter beater cars.  Thats what we need, the junker back up car that will neveer die, so we can drop every penny into the build car.
Don't you DARE import a bunch of Clio V6's and drive their prices up! I NEED ONE! Why did you have to bring it into the attention of this many people?  The normal Clio mk.II phase 3 will be my first car in a year when I get my license, and after some time I WILL upgrade to the Clio V6.  EDIT: I am European
Canned Whole Chicken Recipe:  Remove any giblets which may be in chicken and scrub well.  Wash one, one or two-quart canning jar (depending on the size of the chicken).  Add 1 tsp salt to jar.  Pack raw, skin-on chicken into the jar. If it won't fit you may have to cut it up a bit. Leave 1/2 to 1 inch head space.  Put jar lids in hottest tap water.  Clean the lip of the jar carefully to ensure a good seal and place lids and screw-tops on jar; finger tighten.  Place in pressure canner filled with enough water (not hot) to come 1/2 to 3/4 of the way up the jars.  Process for 90 minutes after pressure has reached 15 lbs.
James, thank you for being back. PEMP!!
You took the belgian flag for the german one, no problem, it's just next door and they invaded twice
W
Prices on these about to sky rocket
Really awesome video James!
3:37  my dream car I don’t want the covetable one but I want it!!! S15❤
Man you just made this channel and I'm already waiting for new videos keep up on this and you will soon be so big
I am unsubscribing. I don't like it
3sge is arguably better than the 2j
Retiring this year, $82K biweekly, this video reminds me of my life in 2023, you have really inspired me in so many ways!!❤️
James, May you pretty please cherry on top PLS make a video that thoroughly explains why the station wagon is one of the best car designs ever made? I would love to hear your take on it and I'd love to see a list of your fav wagons. Thanks bb. Sincerely, A guy who loves practical, sporty, fun, fuel-efficient, cool station wagons from around the world
why does this vid have 793 dislikes?
No, no, no no no no no no  Rear engine French hatchbacks are European and only for Europeans  Let us gate keep at least something 😭😭😭
How much for shipping? Does anyone know the process and $$
your last thought it summing up late stage capitalism.  lol.  weird times gonna turn into shit times soon.  enjoy it while it lasts
James, I love the passion in your videos. I never heard of most of these vehicles, but I am 100% invested in learning about them!
2:14 confirmed Luigi stan. We love to see it.
That shirt is smoooth
I remember googling that Renault after playing Forza 3 so long ago. Was very disappointed to see it was a European car.
Here's another one for you, the Toyota Aristo. The Japan only GS300 with an engine option that the GS300 never had.....
Love the Renault Clio. If I had the cash, that would be a great unique buy, normal enough to blend in yet unique enough for north america it would get a lot of looks. Mid engine V6 is baller.
Great video. Would love to see more representation of cars from other markets than EU and Japan though. There has to be some awesome small off roaders available for import from Brazil and Mexico in the next couple years.
Try Rocket Money for free: https://RocketMoney.com/Speeed
You should make a video on the cars that can be imported from Mexico if that is a thing or Possible
Where is my Idaho Potato episode?! My spuds growing warts waiting 😂
Oh no! the connoissseur in you!  The Renault Turbo 2 was devoid of that cool art-deco interior and exterior... :(  Time for a speeeeeeedy revision dude!  I love you.
Is that a KLEIN quantum pro in the background?!!! That’s a nice bike!
couldnt have disrespected the german flag anymore lmao
Am I drunk or are all the german cars represented by a belgium flag?
Where can I get that Renault?!?
3:26 omg that cod unlock sound was so nostalgic. Man the ending of this started making me really think... were getting old now. 3 more years till im 30 but i feel like i was playing in the backyard with my friends and nerf guns a few weeks ago, that was 2008.
Eyyyy the Noble spotted in that twin-cities clip is a buddy of mine!
All the German Cars have a Belgium flag under them …
Lol watching this from the freedom land with 15 year import rules 😊
James Pumphreeey!
In 2050 I'll be buying a Toyota Alphard or Vellfire
Renault is so underrated. They made crazy v6 Clios and Megane RS with Rollcages and Bucketseats..
Dude, those are Belgian flags, not German...Next up, up to speeeeed with...the sickest, coolest, country flags! hahaha
You used a belgian flag for a german car.
Book suggestion - "The Name of the Wind". Then we can all enjoy it then complain about the author and how he is a POS for not releasing the third book in over a decade 🤣
Using the Belgium flag 🇧🇪  for the German flag 🇩🇪. Is a bit of a big mistake😂.But I think it's funny. (I'm dutch🇳🇱)
Let's gooooo ! We can officially import the Belgian built Lupo GTI !!
that's not the german flag lmaoooooo
Since when is every German car from Belgium? Great Video though
You are such an amazing host, keep the work up!
There we are
Editor mixed up the German flag with the Belgian flag, nice
James! What’s up my Kentucky brother!? Hope all is well over there in California.
Damn us Belgians make a lot of cool cars

Make a video about cars getting too big....the law says a vehicle can be as big as a bus if that's what there going for we need to stop em

I already got the r34 (in fortnite)

Great video
playing your video at the Christmas party is savage
Bad take on France ☠️ all the "rich". Maybe the book club should read a book on how bad the French revolution was. Don't go around saying commie 💩. That is cringe.
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Most of these cars are German, not Belgian 😂😂It's easy to get them mixed up though
This is so great James! I love vids like this!
blessings be upon us, a new speeed video! 💚
I looked forward and click immediately when y'all drop a video.   I love the Renault Clio V6! It is always a go to if available in games for me. I'd love to own one.
Things I love from Speeed: deep dives into literally any topic.  Things I don't love from Speeed: here's a list of cool stuff you can't afford!
