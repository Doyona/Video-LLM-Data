Great darts!!
I have been watching Ricardo for a while and noticed that he does not have a Name on the back of his shirt like the others and l have decided to give him the Name Tea Drinker.
Ricardo why ďo you play darts and get beaten by a better player and then have the guts to say some thing on his ear. You should just not play at all.
Woo hoo
Woo hoo
Why did jonny Clayton change his shirt
Pitrescheko l think needs to learn how to smile and respect other players.
Luke 💪🏼
27:12 pikachud
what say pikachu to littler in Semi ? he looks weird
Nin darter … Where ?
I wish Rob Cross could play like this now, He seems to have given up and it’s soo frustrating watching him play
Littler is amazing!!!!
Looks like a woman.needs a hair cut.
Luke should have told Pietreczko to piss off.
Incredible dart player !
World champion soon Luke littler
Moore Sharon Taylor William Martin Carol
New fan of darts here, what are the numbers next to their country?
what did pikachu say to littler does somebody know ?
Ricardo, bboohoooo
I cannot believe this "kid" is 14 years old. I know a thing or two about skin elasticity, and I swear upon all my medical school books that Littler is at least 35.
Luke is quality
Luke really is quality
Love him or hate him gerwyn is bloody great entertainer
At least Rob Cross knows how to behave when he loses. Not like that sulking Pietreckzo. And I am still at a loss to see why he got so stroppy when Luke went for 147 via treble 19 then double tops before bull. Luke missed the double top and handed a chance to Pietreczko who took it and won that leg!
Rob Cross is a gentleman... but! his resetting after every dart when he's on a finish is ridiculous...
Oscar Dela Hoya is on fire
It's at 40:35
40:39 - 9 darter
Littler was definitely more delighted at the 9-darter than at the win. Good for him.
9 Darter at 40:39
The next phil taylor
Well done luke so proud of you
Very very impressive from the kid! Rob Cross is a pure class act in both winning and defeat. Btw. I am happy as long as Gerwin Price don't win :)
1:03 - i really like this camera split screen -  I dont think ive seen it cut like that before
Luke Littler is such a genius.
Fair play to Ryan Searle getting to the Quarters using 2 darts 😂
23:42 Littler goes for D20 Bull when needing 90, which led Pietreczko to accuse him of arrogance, and then 27:10 whispers in Littler's ear at the end.
Class act from Rob Cross. Embeaces the 9darter, congratulates for the victory. Easily one of my favourite players for his sportsmanship.
Pikachu the pokemon 😂
What a goal Mudryk
Just love the camaraderie of these players … well most of them!!! Excluding that German loser!!
Damm!!  What i liked was rob at the end showing his respect top bloke.
40:37
trully a wonder boy
Luke Littler as a german- Luke H.....
Dose anyone 😮else get fed up with these two monkeys commentating all the way through a excellent game. Talking dribble 😏😏
Great Belgian fans, Thank you.
Littler needs a diet
Why did not show the 4th leg of littler 😂😂
Pietreckzo is a rat pass it on.
Let's play darts 🎉🎉🎉
Great final! A pleasure to watch that nine darter!
Geezer 😂❤❤
Kid can throw
I would like to see any mixed doubles darts championship to happen. Like Luke Littler with Jermaine Wattimena V the rest I think would be a great paring it was so nice to watch them both.
Hope pikacringe gets boo'ed everywhere he goes
GERWYN PRICE & LUKE LITTLER the 2 most disliked dart players on the planet
By the way what happened to Gun Storm?
9 darter on his World Series debut 9 darter on his Pro Tour debut 9 darter on his Euro Tour debut Is there anything that this kid can't do?
9 darter in the final - absolute madness
The crowd with every dart is perfect
Nice to see Stephen Bunting playing well , really nice guy.
I sat and watched the whole thing and not once did i see Rowen Atkinson, Hugh Laurie, Steven Fry or Tony Robinson. So why be sponsored by Blackadder? Bring out Baldrick for a cunning plan.
As soon as Pietreczko loses, his face is saying it all. Littler just likes to play, he's trying to go some other routes. Pietreczko still gets smashed even when his opponent gets experimental and he starts crying like a baby.
I only watch LL....USA
Is it possible that as he ages he will begin to look younger?
is that the frostpunk guy counting?
Ricardo P very poor behaviour not what you would expect outside of closing time down the local boozer and very well handled by Littler and an excellent final which had everything a nine darter, excellent scoring, nice finishing and no handbags drama
i hope pikachu gets a big fine for his disgusting behaviour, his last outburst was im not playing if i get boo'd grow the f up Lukewas and is alot better than you grow up and if you cant lose nicely best you do give up sulky
i rarely dislike any commentators but paul nicholson is annoying
Ricardo looked angry?
It pains me to say it, but he's better than Taylor
pincha couldn't hit what he's aiming for with his darts so did he shoot his words on littler who had that surprised look in the end???
Ricardo.... ricardo... dude, i have the odd good nite where i play to the level he showed ( not too great 😂).
Littler is gunna be a gun for a longtime obviously... but, more youngsters whove been playing since the day they were born due to darts recent decade of success will be continually coming thru in the very near future! He will have some Hard competition ....
Rob blew it. Gave the game to Littler. Great standard though
Rob is a legend
Still refusing to believe that price and bunting are the same age
Littler spielt mit seinen 16 Jahren jetzt schon fast Taylor Niveau.,!! Bissi mehr Konstanz und Gelassenheit in manchen Situationen wünsche ich ihm.,!! Der Rasiert bald alles konstant... Wenn er dieses Niveau halten kann,!!! Toller Spieler....Respekt 🍀🍀🍀
Needs to go to the gym
Pietreczko is so jealous of littler, cant stand him. Such a sulky little brat.
Luke Littler for BBC sports personality of the year
Is Gerwyn Price still considered a prick?
What will Luke be like in say Three years?😮 astonishing tskent, and great sportsmanship from Rob cross. Well played both pkayers❤
24:10 A double top/bullseye attempt on 90? Is this an exhibition or a professional event?
Wonder what Ricardo said to Luke at 27:11 looked kinda aggressive. Even luke was like "this guy" afterwards.
I use to respect Pikachu a lot. But he let himself down here. Getting upset over the way Luke wants to checkout. Then calls him out on social media over it. What a sore loser.
I wounder what pikachu said to Littler
How did anyone think giving Paul Nicholson a commentary gig was a good idea??
I’ve always loved Rob Cross very respectful in defeat unlike Price. Luke Littler IS the real deal. What a competitor at 17 and long may it continue. 😊
Nine Darter 😍
A lot of negative Pikachu here. Important to remember these matches are heavily (and poorly) edited. Theres a bunch of needle that might have been cut out. Especially if companies are continuing to push 'Littler is the new darting messiah' angle.
Ricardo should take some class notes from rob. What a final
WOOWW!!LITTLERR YOU ARE BRILLIANT!!!🎉🎉
well done lad. Win or lose it always amazes me how he handles the pressure so well considering his age. imagine after another year or two if he settles a bit more.
I reckon LL could possibly be future world champion at the rate he's carryinng on. Great to see Belgion fans so respectful. What a fabulous example of how a fans from all sports should behave.
Anyone have any idea what Ricardo might have said to Luke ?? The Luke's reaction was almost shocked !
Pikachu used Tantrum. Its Not very effective. Pikachu returned to his pokeball
big respect for littler and cross, what i high level finale!
Luke fire got me back into darts
40:40 Lukes 9 darter thank me later
Well Done Luke Awesome watch respect too Rob Great Final 👏
@Leeswinbun Luke the nuke little has hit a nine darter he did it in Bahrain and now he did it in the Belgian darts open and now he's won the whole thing on his debut well played luke and rob cross being a gentlemen and good sportsmanship and rob says well done and well played to you rob cross as well and what a final and i will see you back in the premier league darts in Nottingham rob cross Michael smith Michael van Gerwen Gerwyn price Peter wright Nathan Aspinall Luke Littler and Luke Humphries 🎯🎯
An amazing weekend of darts, watched every game and thoroughly enjoyed it. The players, the amazing supporters and nine dart leg made it special. Congratulations Luke the Nuke! 👍🏼🇬🇧🎯🎯🎯
Pikachu 😢😢😢😂😂😂😂😂😂
Luke is a beast
Been watching the darts since the days of Jocky, Eric and Bobby and it’s a great sport that deserves the attention it gets. These guys are great players now compared to the 70’s & 80’s players, the consistency of these “new” players is phenomenal.
ricardo, youre putting dirt on our beloved pokemon's name, pikachu.
What did ricardo say to litler 27:10
If you think D20-bull is a poor choice of finish why would you be upset that your opponent goes for it?
lol Pika was crying on his instagram story
amazing luke littler🎉🎉congrats nine darts..💪💪full power!
WoW what an amazng final... Had everything 🎯
27:10 - can we get a lip-reader in please? Littler looked nonplussed.
Ricardo salty as hell. Calls Littler arrogant in his instagram story "I hope he gets punished for his arrogance". Well he made a 9 darter and won the tournament while you were driving home Ricardo! lol
What a final! Ever since Cross took out Taylor in his swan song, I've never cared much for him, but he grows on me every time I see him play. A bundle of class and talent. Well played to both!
AMAZING Well done Luke xxxxx
Can someone explain to me why Pietreczko was angry and had a bad behave with Littler? I can't understand
Rob cross plays a fantastic year allot of good throws ...littler yeaa the new nmbr1 with a little luck let's say that ❤
Luke the Nuke is so unfair good man its insane
, Pikacu ignorant face!! Bad loser! Good job Luke. 👍🇸🇮
how can you not love Rob Cross,  just as happy for his opponents 9 as he is for his own ! Bravo Rob! 🥰
That double 5 with the last dart by Littler to make it 7-7.. was superb
well done Luke!!!!!!!!
Respect to Rob Cross, but wow Luke Littler, a title and a nine-darter. Simply brilliant!
Very nice guy Rob Cross,  Luke the same, brilliant to watch.
What a joke Pikachu is😂 as a german i really like most of our players, but he is just such a sore loser...  And to have the audacity to make an Instagram story saying "i hope he get's punished by his arrogance"🤦🏼‍♂️
Ricardo, its a few times now, i have seen him make a fool of himself. He rather steps up and dont lose or starts being humble and respects he got beat. Total snowflake.
Yeah Rob Cross was brilliant but jeeeeez the other guy wasn't bad was he
Ricardo, get yourself some knitting needles mate and get a new hobby
Picachoo is very disappointing
Agre with pietreczko littler is an arrogant shit you can see it evertime he plays
Pikachu a bit sour.. Luke nukes him and bags a 9 darter to boot.. go on Nuke!
Last time bunting  was on a roll it was a sausage roll from greggs😂
Like a ghost
27:09 seriously? Pietreczko actually got upset or rather perceived Littler as arrogant because Littler used unusual checkout methods? What does the guy even imagine saying something like that? What an impudence. Every player can decide for themselves which numbers they play on. He still lost the game :-D Really embarrassing move from Pika! This guy is getting a little annoying!
Very high quality final, great crowd, Littler a great entertainer and Riccardo Pikasomething a sad little man - the new darts villain 😮
From california, go darts go. I mean go Littler go!
Fantastic. Wasn’t the Nuke hitting them! I don't get the hate. Been watching darts since a kid and never seen anything like it. Bet it was amazing to be there.
whole buncha littler sympathizers lol  needs to keep going become another van gerwan
5:30.  27:09.  29:07.   37:25.    40:08    40:40      42:45
Rob cross just handed him the win, what a useless player 😢
Littler branded of being arrogant . nothing wrong with that when you can Walk the Talk .
I think the most impressive thing about Littler, besides the obvious wins and 9darters, is how he consistently scores 100+ in his matches. The majority of times he’s lost has been because guys have raised their game.
I wonder if he acts like that when he loses a game of Pokemons?
Very Ordinary from Pikachu. Luke means no disrespect going for those shots. Get a grip and take the loss to a better player like a man.
I just love the Rob throws. Looks so nonchalant yet so precise at the same time
The boy can play, but there’ll never another Phil Taylor. Goat.
Bottom left corner of the board really lol
OMG, brilliant final and all games. Congratulations, Luke Littler. Love Rob Cross, too, Exelent 💓👏💓
Heil Littler.
If Luke Littler has confidence in his own darts and has different ways of getting rid of 501, then yes that is arrogance, but what enjoyable arrogance.
Only thing stopping Littler from winning many world titles will be cholestrol . . . Humphries may be a hurdle
Rob Cross true sportsman. The respect he shows to his opponents is a great example for any young kid taking up sports.
WHAT AN ABSOLUTE LEGEND DARTS ARE BACK WITH LUKE THE NUKE , ITS SUCH A JOY TO JUST WATCH HIM PLAY ,
Rob cross most cool Player of Darts rn I want to find Luke sympathic but i cant find anything... Congratulations🎉
At 27'10" what did Recardo say to Littler?
What a top guy rob is ! ...... sprints up in my respect
Amazing final
9 darter 41:00
love the belgian fans
Pikachu is a terrible loser
So easy to matchfixing darts.. i saw some strange matches around here...
Pikachu got nuked.
What was pika crying about after his match with littler?
To think Peter Wright was 54 today and is 3 x Littler's age.If Littler lives to 54 it will be AD 2061🎯
This kid is amazing
I would consider myself a darts casual, could someone explain why Ricardo was angry at Luke?
Next time Littler stands behind Pikachu he's gonna Pokemon the arse.
27:10~   love to know what RP was saying to LL
ricardo you better go to rob cross and ask him how a good player treats a better player!
Pietreczko very salty sad man. Littler deserved the win after that 9 darter 🎯🥶
Luke is not human!!!!!
33:22  Belgian men don't whistle on a shot, women moan.
Littler is great but hope he watches his weight, big lad already at 17.
🎯🎯
Only threat to littler domination is littler himself. Next few years the birds and the booze
Can anyone tell me what's the tune at the end there?
dang, shouldnt have read the comments after the Luke/Pikachu game because now I know everything!! Was wondering what was said, but looked a bit petulant from Pikachu!
Cross just bumped up in my top 5 after this one
heads gone 27:10 😂
The state of littler for 17 years old, great darts player but he’s got to work on his physique, lad looks terrible!
Outstanding darts
Is it absolute scenes, or is it not?
So glad Cross lost, hate his slow play and stupid smile.
LITTLER!!!
What was that tramp Ricardo at 👊
Johnny Clayton, maybe you should go back to the day job, or maybe you’re back labouring, the reason for your poor darts form
How is this 40 year old 16 and so good
Quality from littler fair play the talent he has is insane... but watch the weight kid you'll be the next Andy Fordham before you know it because he's piling on the weight every time you see him hopefully he got the right people in place to keep him fit for many years to come
What a player luke littler! Breaking records, smashing 9 darters. Winning 2 tournaments in his first senior tour. Im excited to see how far he can go!! What a talent
Both players brought their A game in the final. Do these results count in the Order of Merit?
4 months ago nobody would give this kid a second glance on the street. Bit of fame and money is crazy
Ricardo is the definition of a beta male
L Littler, darter with brilliance...
Lost alot of respect for pikachu, in no way was littler show-boating, bellend.
Littler 9 darttastic, is the any more this kid is gonna shock us with.🎯.
He's good another 15 yrs of this 😅😅😅😅
Congrats Luke the nuke
Littler is just insane.
Commentators are 💩
Rob Cross is a veteran and is a very classy player indeed
That pikachu hissy fit was a weird one 🫠
And all of this could have ended in the first round.
Standard of darts is of the scale
Fsir play to cross doesnt rake the loss like an absolute baby
Booooo littler!!!!
As a huge darts fan from Germany I can only apologize for the way Pikachu presented himself here, can only hope that he works on himself mentally. Unfortunately, not all Germans are as likeable as Thomas Müller
Pietreczko is an embarrassment to Germany in this game! he needs to grow up.
LMAO, L Littler battering that pouting scrawny German, he rattled that Muppets head big time....where's all the Euro Donkeys gone?......taxi rank,.....Homer Simpson a.k.a.  MVG is driving 🤣🤣
Just enjoying his life , he just won and the tunes started and he was off in a club 😎
Wtf are ppl blaming Pikachu? Littler behaves like an arrogant prick since he arrives to the PDC. Is the the better player? Of couse! Is the gonna be the goat of darts? Probably! Does it justify being an arrogant twat? No!
Belgium fans have to be the best in darts: they cheer the player who they want to win but stay quiet and respect the other player. English and German crowds should take note. That's exactly how it should be.
Pikachu gets hot dogt by Littler and Greaves, he the little dog caliber between Littler and Greaves 😂
why was that skinny kraut having a pop at littler for
Pikachu can fight me in a street fight Wrestling Match and will found out that I am his daddy 😂
Luke Littler is living the dream, he first hits a nine darter and won his first world series event on his debut, now he’s hit a nine darter and wins on his EuroTour debut as well!!! Littler is definitely gonna be a new major winner!!!
What was said between littler and the German geezer??? Littler didn't seem impressed at all like
Still not a fan
Good final that Luke did well to bring it back and the 9 darter was insane
Fu.. Littler.. this remember me to all Japanese Kids, playing Beethoven on Piano perfectliy
What did ricardo say?
Rob Cross a true sportsman and a pleasure to watch
How sad is that Pitreschko? Always respected and supported the likes of Clayton, Cross etc who are great and respectful winners and losers
You lot may question luke littlers age.... you should consider bunting... hes 38 guys... 38!!!
Hi Littler ✋
Pikachu was the biggest looser of the weekend, unsympathetic as fu...!
Well done - gave away any surprise about the nine darter in the title.  I bet they like to stamp on kid's birthday cakes too.
Pietreczko really needs to sort his mind out. He once again made a complete clown of himself for no reason whatsoever.
what is the euro tour why is it different to things like the bahrain masters and other stuff
27:12 That was not a nice handshake…
luke must have sold his soul to the devil. amazing.
Pitchicoo, what a twunt at the end!!
Wow littler on fire, well done  young man well deserved to beat Rob he was very good too 👏 👍
Cannot wait for the World Grand Prix - Luke will be ALL OVER doing a double-in 9-darter there!! Also grats to Littler for now being seeded in any tournament in 2024+ now.
Littler is absolutely amazing, 3 debuts in "tournament types", 3 nine darters. Best teenager ever?
Waiting for all the littler haters……
Good to see Luke Littler begin the journey to just get the plaudits the media and commentators have already given him. Give him 20 years and he might just get there. Well done Luke. Keep ignoring them and focus on yourself.
Guys, have some sympathy... it's that time of the month for Ricardo
Luke Littler is a brilliant dart player, I just can't believe when I look at him that he is only 17 years old.
Anyone knows what Ricardo said to Luke? Luke looked disgusted/confused??
RICARDO WAS PISSED HAHAHAAHHAHAH WHAT A SNOWFLAKE.
Pikachu what the heck was that. Mad that someone is checking out in unorthodox ways?
Littler haters will be mad
Luke the god damn Nuke!!!!!!
Get in Lukey boy......Brilliant darts.....Anyone seen Pikachu.....yeah he's having a cry in the back 😂🎉😊
Pikachu sweet dreams 😮
45:53 zesty littler
rob💔 😊
Great win for all the hater 😂😂😂
What a great competition. Makes me want to go down to the next one. That Luke Littler 9 darter was just mad too
I was never a huge fan of Rob Cross, but the respect he gives to Luke makes me like him more and more.
Gutted for Rob
41:15  9 darter
Thoughts below.      Luke Littler really loves hitting 9s and winning same tournaments on his debut, doesn’t he? What a wonderful new player we have on the oche. I’m gonna enjoy it while I can. 😁
Spoiler alert . . . . . . . . Bobby averaging 108 in the final and still losing is so typical for him the past couple years, especially on the euro tour 😂 surely he keeps playing like this he will win a big tournament this year. As for Littler well there are not enough superlatives to describe him he is simply outstanding!!
Great first Euro Tour of 2024,and a 9 darter in the final👌Congratulations to the Champion 🏆 🎯
What a great final, nine dart perfection! Congrats Luke Littler.
I like the fact that Littler doesn't run around the stage gurning into the cameras when he wins matches , fair enough on a 9 darter though
Belgium fans were brilliant - respect. Would be great to have them host a premier league night!
Pika, hold this L for me buddy 👍
Suck on it Ricardo 😂
The Euro Tour is back and i loved every second of it. My favourite series of tournaments on the darting calendar. The Belgian fans r absolutely brilliant and they have set a high standard for all the other venues.   What a tournament we had here this weekend with a superb final to cap it off and just the small matter of a 17 year old kid winning on debut, hitting a 9 darter on the way just as he did on the World Series and the Pro Tour. The Nuke really is the debut king and hes a special, generational talent and the best thing thats happened to darts in recent times. I just cant wait to keep watching him play and watching all the other top pros having to play at the top of their games to try and beat him. Rob Cross played brilliantly throughout and even had a 108 average in that final and still came up just short but it shows how good u have to play to try and beat Littler which is great for the viewers and for entertainment. Long may this continue.
First 🎉
