genuinely always thought monty was a peak character even after i found out he pretty much did kill bonnie rather he was “controlled” or not he was valid in some sense and i stand by that, did he need to kill him? no, but he wasn’t given an opportunity and he made a opening for him to have a shot which then i felt like leads him into being self centered which is why freddy is in the trash if you do monty golf in the first game! he’s very relatable in the sense of never being given a chance and it doesn’t anger people.
I’m just gonna answer your guys question so people are saying what if Gregory was in the suit and I think it easy to say that first it’s Monty’s imagination and also when he comes back to the world he is still in the jug band and then exactly after Monty killed Bonnie he went for chica and Roxy and then he killed Freddy so yea that’s the answer which means Gregory is probably not in the suit
This is the peakest thing to come out of FNAF music in a LONG time.
can't put my finger on it but.. like any living tombstone song after 2020 just feels.. wrong? it doesn't have any of the charms that older tlt songs have like this one kinda tastes like a.. nothing burger..? and the lyrics are just guh 'can i get another w' who tf wrote this
Best Tombstone song  I will stand for this in my tomb
keller
Most clean intro ever tbh-
How am i supposed to be scared you will kill me when you run like that.
I just realized its "till the spotlight finds your place" and not "steal the spotlight, find your place"
La animación de la canción está brutal 🤵🌹
Where is sun and moon
glamrock bonnie wouldve been my favorite animatronic
0:30 Love how when it says "You got style, you got ambition, so do whatever it takes" it looks like its Bonnie's hologram saying it, and Monty takes it as a personal message and indication as to what to do, as if he understood he was talking to him directly
I was at least expecting Freddy to be able to beat him. What is the moral of this story even?
Make a amanda the Adventurer song
It should have been in the original
the theory that inspired this video makes me think.. what if Roxy killed Glamrock Foxy? Maybe that's why she has confidence issues about her looks because she wears the shoulder pads of Foxy?   Edit: Maybe also guilt
Amazing Vocals, Amazing Script, Amazing Beat. GREAT work!
Glandlok mister ippo?
Y O U   C A N    H I D E,    B U T    Y O U     C A N’ T   H I D E
Amazing work keep it up TLT
I love how friendly he is to the staff bots while he's still a "nobody" at the start of when he becomes the star of the show he treats them like trash and doesn't give a single Frick about them
I HATE MONTYYY WITH MY SOUL
I love fnaf songs
Damn this is good
40 hours in 2 weeks for pokemon za
solo faltan 20 dias y 20 noches para la segunda película de FNAF 2 cada vez más cerca para la canción de los creditos
Literally feels like a Disney song A good one tho
Bro cooks with every fnaf song he makes. Literally the best song channel in the community 🍳 ❤
This is so funny because it's made so that Monty is shown a villain and then at the end it shows "Monty Rulez" and then it shows us the Monty we saw at the beginning.
*blushes at Glamrock Chica* GLAMROCK BONNIE, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MONTY😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠
THIS IS SO PEEAAAK
2:06 THEY BE VIBING CRAZY
Es un temazo
and this is why i hate monty
I always wanted him
REALLY GREAT SONG BUT WHY DID IT REMIND THAT HE KILLED EVERYONE AND HE IS ON A KILL STREAK😂
what i do big dawg 😭😭😭
The lord is so messy we simply made up a new one
I like how nobody's talking about how monty did roxy, dirty
Hey man, do you miss that one from FNAF 2 too?
Absolutely love this!!! The animation was super charming!
Lore accurate monty
2:06 Bottom left Monty on his default Mixamo type shit
2018: Basics in Behavior 2025: fnaf         Use headphones to hear best experience 🎧
2:08 pov
August 29 is my birthday
This animation is spectacular, the singers voice really matches monty, its a BANGER, AND it's lore accurate??? Plus a security breach song this long after it came out? I love it! <33
THIS IS A FNAF SONG? WHAT?
Okay here me out… please reanimate basics in behavior with PGHfilms or maybe do it yourself search a few tutorials seeing how good this animation is… can you reanimate basics in behavior?
Waiting for someone to do an hazbin hotel version about Vox and Alastor
This song came out on my birthday
There's a godlike character in a series me and some friends are making that relate to this. Polymorphic has an intense jealousy to Shader
This always makes me wonder why they never replaced Bonnie. If the books are right about there being multiple Pizzaplexes, was Bonnie’s murder exclusive to that one Pizzaplex or did every Monty decide to kill every Bonnie? Was he threatening them and that’s why they didn’t replace Bonnie? Was Fazbear Entertainment just that lazy?
I love the animations that are in this video ❤✨
It is nice
How was the epic
0:51 I have a new favorite character
LOVE THE ANIMATIONS LOLLLLL ONE OF THE MONTYS IS DEFAULT DANCING
i love giga monty *plink*
2:06 club penguin dance
2 months late but mr I love this song it's good and my fav fnaf charecter in Monty some to me 100 out of 100 on this song
I love this, but it seems a bit quite. Awesome song tho.
2:07  you can see one monty doing the burger king guy dance, with a green screen behind.
loved the possible reference of giga monty army from astral spiff videos
I feel bad for bonnie, wet floor sign-bots, the security bots, and the rest of the animatronics they have to see and experience everything😔
This song is DOPE!!🔥
What could possibly be happening
This gave me more insight on Monty’s personality than most of Security Breach  This is Magnificent
monty doing the tenna dance lol 2:08
Hell nah bro they got Monty.exe 😭😭😭🥀🥀🥀💔💔💔
I heard this in an edit and thought the song was good. I was surprised when I found out it was a FNAF song. Still good though. It also sounds like something out of Toy Story
I fan monty
Beyond the fact it's about Monty I think what the song really is about deep down is a lust for fame it's not about someone looking up to someone and wanted to be like them it's about someone so desperate to be in the spot light that will do anything to be in it even if it means hurting those around them or maybe I'm just looking too deep into it idk
Monty was my favorite from the moment I saw him.
Оставлю здесь свой комментарий, пока не поздно
Can't believe vox said this
This music video should be part of a movie or a show 🎥
Giga monty acknowledged
Shut up, take my money, and make this a reality. 💵💵💵
Anyone in 2025?
Good i sou isomeri
How come I never commented whenever it first came out? To be honest even if this song didn't come out and I heard it somewhere else, I'd instantly say it's a Tombstone song.
Where is bonnie eyeliner
PEAK SONG ITS SO GOOD but don’t show this to Cory!!!
2:04  let's just say he is not going to be working for a while..
1:57
I like the part that says dear freddy it ain't personal
1:39 bro she got thrown a kart
2:07 that's alot of monties
Better then a Disney movie
10/10
Now all we need is a fnaf SB:R and SOTM song
Gods the animation on this is SO GOOD I really hope the folks behind this feel proud of it
Idk if its intentional but the potential Giga Monty reference towards the end was nice
TLT has never made a song that's not a banger
se volvió mi canción favorita de the living tombstone XD
Fine this song is fine but still sucks 😂😂😂😂😂
This sucks
Monty the menace
Almost all the others got instrumentals, and I would really like to hear this one, but I dont think they'll make it which makes me sad.
Hey guys, I got a badge for being tlt’s top listener❤
2:06 timestamp for me
thelivingtombstone make a bad song challenge (IMPOSSIBLE!!!)
the part at 1:16 is very good
Hey this reminds me of the really good old days… thank you
Cory boutta crashout once he see this
Monty is like the absolute idea of greed if it was goated
this is the most up beat yet dark song I have heard in a long while [I like it ALOT]
Пойдет
The animation is crazy, the song is fire
Its so peak
1:15
Soy un pescado , soy un pescado , soy un pescado
Destrua ele
The background music is too loud, so I can't hear the song.
HOLY SHIT, WHAT AN EPIC SONG! Keep it up @TheLivingTombstone
🐊🔥
Poor Bonnie😢😢😢
Why did the ending remind me of king k rool
+1 FNaF song to memorize
Love how the camerawork hides the wounds that wouldn't make sense with the storyline the song is telling, like Bonny's torn-open chest. Excellent work, lads.
🔥
if somebody said I would be enamored with a FNAF song in 2025, I'd laugh yet here we are
damn
Am I the only one that doesn't think Monty killed Bonnie?
I like how Monty slowly gets more and more like a glamrock the more he kills them
2:06 I knew it was a dream when there was so many of them I can’t imagine that’s lore accurate Gregory would be Gregore-y if that was reak
The joy i had be able to hear this song LIVE in houston, this song and many others by this band from that night will live in my heart because of that night!
I like how this song can be used for any type of villain character that exists
This song is so underrated
Выпились 😊
*sobbing uncontrollably*
Everything is fine
i LOVE the detail that in the beginning of the song, Monty hits a chica print golf ball that hits a roxy print one and later in the song he kills chica first then Roxy! and at the end of the song Monty Bonnie's pose and the graffiti "GIVE ME BACK MY EYES" on roxy ie SUCH a funny reference to her in-game line!
This is not canon
Did you say "shot"? Did you say [[BIG SHOT]]?
Sounds so much like the Vox song
Can't wait to see people saying "Anyone in  2030?"
i love you monty JASJA
Okay I want to say is that, this is good and rhythmly to me. Which I like it
Guys guess what  “Com’n engi we’re your friends”  “Shut up demo I’ll kill u” “Sorry pal can we make amends?” “Shut up scout I’ll kill u” “Why can’t we just talk it out”  “Not this time doc” “Mmmhhmmm mhm mmhm” “Shut up pyro I’m killing you slow”
This song is so good i genuinely cant express it in words
little too quiet
cant wait for the secret of the mimic song
The Crying Child's Chariot Cannot Be Stopped
I am happy that the channel is not in decline, this topic is SPECTACULAR
Nice 👍👍
this is bringing me back to those 2015 vibes
Aí eu sou protagonista eu sou melhor que todo mundo:
1:34 OMG the bin is the cupcake
five nights at fredd6
A good song, a little quiet though
2:06, what a huge amount of easter eggs to cover here. monty does: the cabbage patch, the macarena, the ymca, the burger king guy's "can't wait to meet you", headbanging, the gangnam style, push ups, slams his fists against his chest, rides a skateboard, all while two of them are breakdancing. the animators really had fun, huh?
Peak, the fact that this instantly shot up on my list of fav fnaf songs as someone who listened to the old songs when they released is very telling on how good this is
The animation quality holy goddamn pecking hell My eyes are melting from how good it is and how well it works with the song
Spamton?
Could we get an instrumental version of this?
Cory wouldn’t like this one… not at all….
Siento que el sonido esta algo bajo, se le tiene que subir mucho para que se escuche, me encanta la canción
hi hi hi, people in 5 - 9 years!! :D
Amazing
🔥
Saw this live and can confirm that it was GAS
ITS! T!V! TIMMMMMMME!
omg daddy step on me too
" It feels like they're bringing the classic essence, you know?  "
the only shitty part of this song is how short it is
Hola
Plot twist: grag came and saved Freddy 😮
Gives Smile HD vibes 🔥
Que bien 🐺❤️😄
This is the moment he became gigamonty
1:02 am i going insane or is that the mimic behind the wall
So basically this song is about protecting your ego
How many times have I reheard this song
Hey listen if I was a little,yellow guy with no hands to fight I would only watch to this guy is crazy
The LEGEND HAS POST
esse caso de inveja entre animatronics ter uma musica, e fnaf 6 não ter é sacanagem
isso foi novidade
THE GIGA MONTIES HAVE ROSEN UP
Explaining lore with music noice
not the roblox dance, gangnam style, and what i think is the burger king dude, XD 2:07
this really is a step on up for security breach music and animation content
Not Monti doing the Mixamo dance at the bottom 2:06
So Monod saw the mimic??? 2:08
this somehow has better animation, models, and sound quality than security breach
Sucks my dlck
Kayak nya cuma aku yang org Indonesia
Jdi itu hanyala hayalan Monty
2:07 Burger King meme in the green screen lol
(0:43) "So can I get another W?" is a funny line lol😭
I got a notification telling me I was the first to watch this…
Awesome!
This is a bop in 1.5x too
i hate monty stop making me like this song😭
K Rool climbing up the tierlists after the crown duplication glitch was discovered.
Thanks ❤❤❤❤
2:08 giga monty reference?
I new it was Monty the whole way that destroyed Bonnie
2 minutes of monty commiting genocide
You saw my comment by going to newest didn’t you 🤪
the studio is jack of all trades whem it comes to epic collabs and refrances, to be real
holy peak
Pô que animação
We GOTTA get Cameron Miller to do a cover of this
Monty looks very funny with that hair 😂
We need a ffps song please i've been waiting for years 🙏
This feels like the most Happy Song of jealousy
This is already so fire 🔥 Wait im a month late.. Pretend I commented this the second it released
He is so greedy for being famous that part that said if I can control my destiny I know what I must do
1:48  Oh I Didn’t Know Alligators Beat Bears
William afton killing the four kids:
Nice
0:58 damn he knocked ts out of Bonnie????

Im sobbing actually, this fandom of fnaf is FIRE i need to learn more of fnaf bc BRO THIS  IS TO FIRW

Peak
0:44 was that bonnie doing Demo's Scottsman's Stagger?
I dont think if Monty are the one who k1lled Bonnie. (I guees?)
This shit is tuff 💯
Common McGuire W
Finally a song about 1 of my favorite character
You got style you got ambicion
peak security breach animation
At 2:07 there's a patbot on top left corner
I don’t like Monty after what he did to Bonnie
This is so cool
Sick my school will be playing  this tomorrow ur the best
This gives Disney villain song
Heck yh. I was so inspired by yours i made mine and im already in greed if your intrested 😊
This animation is stunning great job!!
was that a Giga Monty reference at the end?
Posting the lyrics “find your face” to Bonnie is crazy work fr 😭
I keep coming back to this song and I love it so much. Y'all does anybody else wonder how Coryxkenshin would react to this song considering how much he didn't like Monty in FNAF: SB😅🤣
Now this is peak
I knew Cory was onto something 😂😂😂
ITS SO PEAK🥹
Lyrics:  You'e so much nicer than you gotta Be! A Star and Part of Freddy's Symphony  Praised For Your Ability Charm and Creativity (Okay) They always Liked you More than me  I think they'd want me if I got a shot To show I'm more than just a pair of Claws Prove that I Deserve applause Practice Till I'm good because.. I think the band would have a open spot! You gotta *STEP ON UP!* till the spot light finds your face *STEP ON UP!* till you have found your calling up on center stage You got style! You got Ambition  So do whatever it takes! *STEP ON IN!* *STEP ON HIM!* *STEP ON UP!* I think I'm fin'ly gettin over you So can I get another W?  I'll get what I'm overdue Pay me in exposure too! As long as nobody discovers you.. See you can hide but you can't hide from me.. I'll never say no to my destiny  You bring out *THE* *BEST* *OF* *ME!*  I'll say Open seasame To all the obstacles ahead of me  You gotta- (Glass breaking) *STEP ON UP!* Till The spot light finds your face *STEP ON UP!* Till you have found your calling up on center stage.. Oh Bonnie Boy Your such a Gas! But it's my turn to play.. *STEP ON IN!* *STEP ON HIM!* *STEP ON UP!* Out in the lime light.. Everyone sees you! I think that I might.. Just wanna be You! Hearing them Love me.. Just like- I SEE THEM LOVE YOU! If I control my Destiny I know what I must do! *STEP ON UP!* Till you fin'ly found your Place *STEP ON UP!* Till every boy and girl is CHANTING OUT  YOUR NAME!

McGwire teamed up with the living tombstones i always known him for his rustage collabs like devils luck
Montey is my FAV so this makes me dance around from happiness!
Amanzing
I love this song but sounds so much like an animation meme
Don't worry or think twice about taking the time you need with anything, despite people or situations trying to rush you or anything. Remember it's your choice and you are the one in control, and you are what matters at the end of the day, I wish you the best, not only for the project but for yourself. Don't let anything take what you love doing away from you, and keep your hopes up! 💪
This song belongs in the show
Cory is gonna crash out if he sees this.
Trash
I love this song for the first 2 minutes
❤
As someone who loves Monty, this song is like heaven
this would be fire in beat saber
So good
boy ts so tuffian 😻😻
Animation more expressive than all of security breach
W song
No offense but… I don’t really like the song. It’s doesn’t have the same cg5 magic I’m used to.
Monty was already my favourite but I love him even more now
Y si,los Chanses son asi
Solo diré que que mal... que grosería la de la última
🗣️You gotta... step on up!
No Freddyy!!!!!!!!!!! Whats is wrong whit Monti. 😭😭😱😱😱😱😱😱😢
This is the best
Be back in 7 years 👋
Is anyone gonna mention the giga Monty refrence 😭😭
0:48  fazballs
Maybe the Monty kill Bonnie part is canon?
This made me kick the chair
It’s so weird of how Bonnie got clapped with one hit with a bowling ball. But then the other animatronics surviving other collisions in the games. (Ex: Roxy still active after getting hit by a go-kart. Or Monty still active even though he’s crippled) and remember: I said GAMES, not the music video
It's been a month all ready!? Time really has been flying so fast hear lately any way I love this song so much
This is so peak omg 😭
1:27 why is this part kinda good
The animation for this fan project is absolutely incredible goddamn
This is GigaMonty's backstory
I like how the mimic just there as an Easter egg in several scenes
2:07 THE MONTY IN BOTTOM LEFT, HES DOING  DA TV TIME
1:07 why is there my name bro...
Why did I ignore this when it came out? This is very cool!
This song is feeling nostalgic already
The ending being him just daydreaming was so funny
They’ve still got it. After all these years they’ve still got it.
Was that a giga monty reference?
FNIF!!!
0:58 lol
he forgot about dj music man and sun/moon
Al final mato a Bonnie pero a él se lo cargo un niño culocagado
I love this one so much I can't stop watching
This is my most favorite since 11 years ago about fnafe
I don't know why but this is kinda motivational 😅
Man you really went a long way from making a song about how the franchise isn't good anymore and that Scott is only doing it for fame and fortune
ЭТОЖ ШЕДЕВР почему ещё не популярен????
I really want to learn your amazing skills of composing. I couldn't have ever imagines such a melody
Holy shit this is good but late😂
Is nobody gonna talk about the mimic in the background
You’re so much nicer than you got to be continue from here
Yeah I’m sure I could use it love it ! 2:04  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
GIGA MONTY SONG SOME ONE TELL SPIFF!
Legit an instant classic in my favorite opinion
Legit an instant classic in my favorite opinion
Muy bueno l verdad
Realistically Monty would have been a endoskelenton when he killed Bonnie. There could only ever be 4 stars at a time, and the endos are extras in case of damage.
A-MA-ZING
Song: goofy and fun. What's happening in the video: 4 counts of first degree murder, lol
YEAAAAAAAAA THIS IS SO GOOODD😭😭😭😭😭
Thank you for the season 2 we will never get😢
The Most Envious In The FNAF Universe?? F(
And this is why coryxkenshin hates monty
Nice thing!!
Huuuh?????
Снова фнаф снова мишка Фреде снова та же хуйня...
increible
Why is this lowkey my favorite song. Like I heard this when it came out and thought it was great but not my style and then it stuck to my brain like super glue and now I'm hooked
500 MONTYS.
This is why Cory hates him
This is peak, but I legit can’t wait for the Murder Drones music video.
Убить зайца шаром это изи.
i love this
2:06 it teeeeveeee timeeee
fnaf animation has come so far
PLEASE, I NEED THE INSTRUMENTAL!!!
Why does i think of legosi for some reason
The way he killed roxane was very personal
My crush showed me this song so now everytime I hear it I think of him
I love this animation and its canon
The kills literally give me chills lol
It was do odd hearing McGwire Music bc i listen to their stuff, wasnt expecting him in a TLT FNAF song
2:07 I love to think that instead of just one Monty it is many Montys from that glitch
Pleaseeeeeeeee do more of this style of music, Im addicted to this one🤩
1:07 OH BONNIE BOY🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥
The floo bots killd bony in and that is y moty is agresif and he liked bony
Why is it so quiet? Like even on my max volume it's whispers
1:38 Roxy's death is so comic to me for no reason at all I just found It funny 💔
Why did my suggested nit show me this peak
And now Monty is my favorite character
see y'all again soon
O staff bot sendo brutalmente molestado
I hope this song goes down in fnaf song history
It checks out so much that Monty is the less popular outsider since freddy's band has always been freddy, chica, bonnie, and a vulpine fourth, so he had to make room
This is so peak❤❤
2:07 Oh shit he figured out the infinite Monty glitch
Why Monty is my favorite dang animatronic:
Is it weird why I wonder why they made Monty if he wasn’t one of the actual superstars
So he killed my friend
Honestly, Monty's the best character. In my opinion at least.😅
I love it
The fat that he uses some older models brings back memories
They cooked and it was delicious I will be listening to this whilst falling asleep 😋😋😋
Gavin
monty gator
I wonder how he actually became famous if that was a dream?
Freddy didn't even get a change to breathe.
Even at full volume I can't blast my ears with this 😭
2:07 i love these dancing goobers
Очень хорошо
2:07 Dayum the bottom left monty hittin that IT'S!!! TV!!! TIME!!!
Please hibe a content in a Türkiye Ankara
Please give a concert in Türkiye
We need more FNAF security breach songs
Who else feels bad for the wet floor signs
April 29!!! What the heck that is my birthday cool 😊
Monty you poor thing
If I get 1K likes I'll copyright the music until I get banned                                                             (Joke)
The Animatronic Hunter
How many times have you played this song...  "Yes 👁👄👁"
This is SICKKKKKK. I LOVE ITTTT
.
2 years later
Well, you know what you did to Monty gator you killed Bonnie I mean you couldn Bonnie could’ve helped you.
1:24 evo Monty leaked, nerf miner
The secret of the mimic song when?
Gregory’s parents are preformers
Scott Pilgrim reference
I feel Freddy would be able to win against Monty but that’s just me
💚💚💚💚💚 🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊
Muy chido música para mis oídos🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
Freddy and Greger would have overcome him
"0:34 step on in,step on him,step on up"is just so good foreshadowing
2:07: MONTY DID THE TENNA DANCE!!1!11!!1!!!1!
That sound like SpongeBob
sandwhich
Step on IN STEP ON HIM
PEAK NUSIC
This is so good that its already nostalgic
Amaaazing!!!!!!!!!
I Can't Believe It's Been 11 Years Since The Original FNAF Song!🤩✨🎩🐻
1:15 the fit reminds me of Coronation Starscream
In 0:55 and 1:33 he was murder everyone like the actual crocodile instead of animatronic crocodile
P diddy with his victims 2:03
been listening to this on repeat, its super catchy!! (love when you guys played this at the columbus concert!)
the refrence to the monty duping glitch is crazy
Monty casually kicks off chicas head
OMG THIS IS SO COOL
Found this song a while ago, didn't expect such a banger about a gator with anger issues.
I love how it sounds like the savlonic- epoch remix you guys made back then!
amazing <3
this is actually a banger
1:39 bro monty chill 😭🙏
0:21  did he just get murdered by the door, the door must be strong😂
Bonnie getting murdered in cold blood nobody noticing until after two years 😂
The toilet signs are so cute
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉😊
Wey!! Crayonvt te acaba de hacer un cover muy genial hasta con arte inspirado en Monty y toda la cosa. Dale gracias
Revivo más fandom de fnaf
Ngl he showed a bit of respect to Freddy bc he said it ain’t personal so he had his reasons
👍🤩
Step on him is crazy😂😂😂😂
Atleast Freddy was t bad
JUST SEEN AN EDIT ON TIKTOK OF THIS SONG WITH KING BOO FROM LUIGI'S MANSION O H  M Y  G O D  IT'S PEAK
🔥🔥🔥🙏🙏🙏
uhhh lets make things corect he never killed rock star bonie if eny one dont know itsa long storie but the thing is that they did not let him be part of the glamrock cause he have a very angry charcter
Damn that was beautiful, I love collabs like this
Cassie might be wondering so how have you been after that whole thing I was living a perfect life until the motherfuking Monty threw a go-kart in my face
I can't wait until y'all drop the murder drones song
This video is the perfect embodiment of Monty. His ruthlessness. His lack of remorse. His willingness to step on anyone and anything to get to the stop. A vicious, violent brute with aspirations of fame and glory. "Step On Up" by stepping on those that stand in his way. It's brilliant! :D  Side note: Anyone who thinks Monty is innocent is wrong. Monty was the one who killed Glamrock Bonnie. Not only does all the evidence point to Monty (Bonnie's last location, Monty immediately being promoted to bass player, him frequently shown taking over the band or the implications that he will from Freddy, etc), but the fact that he dies due to an LED sign of Bonnie (turned on by the daughter of a person who is a huge Bonnie fan and has a dislike of Monty to boot) is the death nail to the coffin of his innocence. Even going with the idea that the Mimic's influence pushed him, it's clear that he didn't regret a single thing. At best, all the Mimic did was give him the ability to act on his aspirations.  He might have been influenced, but he was NOT an innocent bot. :/
Things I noticed (will add more)  0:07 foreshadowing who he’ll go after   0:24  Map bot being effected by the mimic  1:04 mimic in top left corner   1:36 lyrics on the wall  1:40  took Roxie’s glasses   1:53  critical errror in the top left and Freddy is at a low battery so he ultimately loses the fight due to being tired   2:07 mimic behind green screen  2:20 SOTM Proto Monty
I love the fact monty is wearing these tan overhaul pants through most of the song
At the end we see monty walking off but what if he's walking off to do same sins he saw in his imagination?
Monty has a dirty mind but also he is creative
Still wonder how A CHILD killed him
CRAZY GOOD! as the goat once said "Kang"
I was playing this on Spotify in my school and we had a fire alarm and I didn’t have time to turn it off so the whole time this was playing. (It was a false alarm)
I LOVE RUBI
The animation looks great the people who did this did a very good job on this project 10/10.
O
There is an error in the video that Monty's costume was given to him when Bonnie disappeared, not before but after.

YAY another fnaf song!
this has to be fnaf's new villain.
This is the cannon of what happened between security breach and ruin
I can’t wait for the murder drone’s music video 🎉🎉
The collab I've been waiting on! YESSSSSSS
THANK YOU FOR MAKING A SONG FOR MY FAVOURITE BOYEEE 🥹🥹🥹🎉🎉🎉🥳
Can't wait for the next banger fnaf song
The tune reminds me of Epoch (idk if im spelling it right)
BANG BANG
Even tho at the end he was just delusional,it still feels incomplete that he killed every animatronic in his own mind
This is why Monty is my favourite animatronic in security breach and the series as a whole: he is the only threatening one in the game, the rest of them don't really have a reason for being evil but Monty is written kinda well as a proper villain
Truly "maximally bad output"
Sound like Jack black singing in this video   The singing voice sounds barely similar
monty
I can't choose just one so i like all of them, but i kinda wished to see hybrids of those 4 species 👋
The best fnaf song to me
Narcissistic personality disorder is a mental health condition in which people have an unreasonably high sense of their own importance. They need and seek too much attention and want people to admire them. People with this disorder may lack the ability to understand or care about the feelings of others. But behind this mask of extreme confidence, they are not sure of their self-worth and are easily upset by the slightest criticism.  A narcissistic personality disorder causes problems in many areas of life, such as relationships, work, school or financial matters. People with narcissistic personality disorder may be generally unhappy and disappointed when they're not given the special favors or admiration that they believe they deserve. They may find their relationships troubled and unfulfilling, and other people may not enjoy being around them.  Treatment for narcissistic personality disorder centers around talk therapy, also called psychotherapy.  Narcissistic personality disorder affects more males than females, and it often begins in the teens or early adulthood. Some children may show traits of narcissism, but this is often typical for their age and doesn't mean they'll go on to develop narcissistic personality disorder.  Symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder and how severe they are can vary. People with the disorder can:  Have an unreasonably high sense of self-importance and require constant, excessive admiration. Feel that they deserve privileges and special treatment. Expect to be recognized as superior even without achievements. Make achievements and talents seem bigger than they are. Be preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mate. Believe they are superior to others and can only spend time with or be understood by equally special people. Be critical of and look down on people they feel are not important. Expect special favors and expect other people to do what they want without questioning them. Take advantage of others to get what they want. Have an inability or unwillingness to recognize the needs and feelings of others. Be envious of others and believe others envy them. Behave in an arrogant way, brag a lot and come across as conceited. Insist on having the best of everything — for instance, the best car or office. At the same time, people with narcissistic personality disorder have trouble handling anything they view as criticism. They can:  Become impatient or angry when they don't receive special recognition or treatment. Have major problems interacting with others and easily feel slighted. React with rage or contempt and try to belittle other people to make themselves appear superior. Have difficulty managing their emotions and behavior. Experience major problems dealing with stress and adapting to change. Withdraw from or avoid situations in which they might fail. Feel depressed and moody because they fall short of perfection. Have secret feelings of insecurity, shame, humiliation and fear of being exposed as a failure. When to see a doctor People with narcissistic personality disorder may not want to think that anything could be wrong, so they usually don't seek treatment. If they do seek treatment, it's more likely to be for symptoms of depression, drug or alcohol misuse, or another mental health problem. What they view as insults to self-esteem may make it difficult to accept and follow through with treatment.  If you recognize aspects of your personality that are common to narcissistic personality disorder or you're feeling overwhelmed by sadness, consider reaching out to a trusted health care provider or mental health provider. Getting the right treatment can help make your life more rewarding and enjoyable.  Causes It's not known what causes narcissistic personality disorder. The cause is likely complex. Narcissistic personality disorder may be linked to:  Environment — parent-child relationships with either too much adoration or too much criticism that don't match the child's actual experiences and achievements. Genetics — inherited characteristics, such as certain personality traits. Neurobiology — the connection between the brain and behavior and thinking.  Risk factors Although the cause of narcissistic personality disorder isn't known, some researchers think that overprotective or neglectful parenting may have an impact on children who are born with a tendency to develop the disorder. Genetics and other factors also may play a role in the development of narcissistic personality disorder.  Complications Complications of narcissistic personality disorder, and other conditions that can occur along with it include:  Relationship difficulties Problems at work or school Depression and anxiety Other personality disorders An eating disorder called anorexia Physical health problems Drug or alcohol misuse Suicidal thoughts or behavior Prevention Because the cause of narcissistic personality disorder is unknown, there's no known way to prevent the condition. But it may help to:  Get treatment as soon as possible for childhood mental health problems. Participate in family therapy to learn healthy ways to communicate or to cope with conflicts or emotional distress. Attend parenting classes and seek guidance from a therapist or social worker if needed.
"Step on in, step on HIM, step on up"  I genuinely love how that line was delivered.
The only implication of five nights at Freddy’s is when he says Freddy but if you just replaced that with any other word this could just be a song of a jealous sound stager
THE HOLE SONG IS ABOUT ROBOT MURDER
Can I get another W🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
𝕄𝕖 𝕔𝕠𝕣𝕖
Wonderful
When I hear this I feel excited and relaxed(thx for making this living tombstone)
2:07 Monty dancing gangnam style is so shish

2:08 GIGA MONTYS!!

My brother doesn't like this character, but he will after hearing this song". this is very crazy
Honestly, they used Proto Monty and made him look Ike Modern Monty if he was in the Pizzaplex, we ignore the several accounts of murder he committed in the song, the song was great, and he always comes back eh?
Monty es muy agresivo
That GigaMonty reference lmfao
he who must not be named

You're so much nicer than you gotta be A star and part of Freddy's symphony Praise for your ability, charm and creativity (okay) They always liked you so much more than me I think they'd want me, if I got a shot To show I'm more than just a pair of claws Prove that I deserve applause Practice 'til I'm good because I think the band could have an open spot You gotta step on up 'til the spotlight finds your face Step on up 'til you have found your callin' up on center stage You got style, you got ambition, so do whatever it takes Step on in (hey), step on him (hey), step on up (okay) I think I'm finally gettin' over you So can I get another W?

0:43 is Monty getting over the fact Bonnie was his odiol and now his first kill
I love this song, good job.
The song is really good but it still feels like trying to sneeze but it doesn’t happen
IM NEW! 🐢🐊
Hear me out
It is a good banger
“STEP ON HIM?!?!?” 🤣
capolavoro 🫶
I thought the alligator was pretty cool now I hope that the alligator gets removed
1:31
At 2am looking for BEANS
idont see any comments about the fact he was walking like michael afton around the start!!! thats an awesome reference!!!
I wonder what would happen if montey was saw by freddy and Roxy and chica before they weren’t ever friends?
Hey can you make a song about roxy replacing glamrock foxy? It would be awsome and add on to the lore
IM SO HAPPY MONTY IS FINALLY GETTING MORE RECOGNIZED, HE WAS MY FAV FOR 4 YRS STRAIGHT!!!!! (STILL IS!!!!! 𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌𓆌
i legit thought this was like a cheerful and motivational song until i saw the music video because my spotify dj kept randomly playing this song 😂
Better than the entirety of security breach
I love this song
Monty: (one shots everyone) “Freddy it ain’t personal” (Makes his death long and gruesome)
This is sonething that a classic would be.
Coryxkenshin would genuinely hate this music video so much
I got a new song to listen to when I'm doing animation 😁
cojeme
Little did monty know, Mr. hippo coming to take his place
Bro needs to get help
2nd best fnaf song for me, Animation and melody is amazing and monty's voice is fire.
The best song 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I aways come
i love the giga monty reference near the end
IM SHOWING TO CORYXKENSHIN
I like this song but it would be cool if they went back to they way they originally did fnaf songs
I JUST REALIZED MONTY IS DOING THE TENNA DANCE IN THE PART OF GIGAMONTY
Y'know this song is saying that Monty knew about the old Murray cleaning bots, if everything was on his mind? 2:07
I freaking love this song!! The Living Tombstone knows how to make music!!
i used to love these songs i still do and i still love fnaf thank you for this so much!
1:06 OH BONNIE BOY🗣️🔥
good boy
You should Collab with OR30!
Ima just going to take some notes..
2:09 have anyone not noticed the cleaner bot is looting at the older clean o vac it’s so cute
montys my fav from sb so im glad he got a w song
2:06 I LOVE THE AMOUNT OF THINGS GOING ON HERE HELPPP monty hitting his chest monty climbing freddy statue monty checking the caution bot monty spray painting monty spinning (breakdancing) monty doing another spinning thing with his head monty doing pushups monty doing the join us for a bite tiktok dance monty doing the YMCA monty breakdancing no.2 monty destroying a staff bot monty doing the gangnam style monty dancing (IDK WHAT ITS CALLED) monty dancing (AGAIN IDK) monty on a skateboard then hitting a dab at the end 2:06
We need an instrumental!!
Bonny was just tryna vibe
This is incredible! It’s good to see people still making fnaf songs
i love it, aaaah! I love it, AAAAAH! I LOVE IT AAAAAAAHHHHHH!!1!!
0:58 This reminds me of Danganronpa v3 for some reason.
its so hard being a monty fan, but its great seeing my goat get the respect he deserves.
2:20
2:07 is he recording a tiktok im screaming  EDIT: HES DOING THE BURGER KING GUY DANCE ?? HELLO??? this community is so moronic (said with admiration and respect) ily all
Damn G. Bonnie got Rantaro’d 😂
0:21  RIP MAP BOT D:
Your explanation is very impressive This deserves recognition.
Bro the way he says ,you are in the way, in fr chilling
Best song by far, and the animation is so good😭
WHY DO YOU JUST DROP OUT OF NO WHERE AND WHY IS IT ALWAYS GOOD
Even realize this was a fnaf song when I first heard it that's when you know it peak
Freddy could beat him
I just cant believe how you make that every song feels new and so amazing
before monty broke freddy in 1:46 doesn't he do the same bonnie pose after they rockstars separate from eachother in 0:40
0:57 the sync of the impacts with the beat were PERFECT
And this is why I took his legs
Peak🎉
I month. Anyone?
Make a movie about this and have this song in the middle of it!
This song is AMAZING!!! Is in the top of Best songs of FNAF
I have no idea if this was intentional, but I found why this song feels so familiar after hearing it once. The start of this and Alistors Game have almost the same beat.
1:02 cant see any one talking about the mimic in the back of this scene, cool detail :)
İ cant stop listening its to good
Peak music
What should have been this comes from inside.
WE NEED FNAF SONGS BACK COMMENT IF YOU AGREE
Yk Monty didnt actually kill Bonnie because vanney controlled him to do it
2:18 "So no head?"
0:07 1:34  i FUCKING love this
I love Monty and all, but it just makes me sad that he wanted to BE Bonnie, so much in fact that he just has a day dream of committing mass murder on the other 3 animatronics. Although knowing how the actual game is going that ain’t happening lol. (Rip Bonnie😭)   I realized my mistake, let me clear up I meant it made me sad that he killed Bonnie cause of how much he wanted to be him. Not that he wanted to be him.
2:03 WHAT DID MY BOY DO?!
0:00 best part
I might make a animation on 0:38 and 1:14  Good song!!
FINALLY YOU GUYS COOK AGAIN 😭
Secret history tails being Monty would be perfect
such a banger
A MONTH AGOOOOOO!
A month ago????🎉🎉🎉
“You bring out the best of me” he says right before bashing Bonnie’s head with a bowling ball
1:02 THE MIMIC😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Good Disney villain song. This sounds like classic living tombstone
Did any one else see the 67 in the background keep watching till you see it
❤❤❤❤❤
I like the idea that monty used to look different
Trying to piece to what genre of music is this.
am i the only one whos like…disappointed..?😭 i just feel like this is very kiddie. like im getting the same vibes/rythm as “im a goofy goober YEAH🤠 you’re a goofy goober YEAH🥜”. im more used to the older dark and eery mixes with a bit of modern pop added but this is just….*eh*. and we waited 11yrs for this..?🫤 again maybe its just me idk. i mean the animation goes hard tho ngl
this fire
For some reason this reminds me of bendy and the ink machine
I've been sleeping on this. This is amazing!
Bloody murder
this is peak
Is the band perfect of old the times
this gives daisies vibe with how cheerful it is
Idk if anyone noticed but with each animatronic he destroys, he gets a new accessory
I'm Monty defender til I DIE
2:19 average steal a brainrot timmy realises his brainrots are gone
This is amazing but WHERE IS BONNIE'S EYELINER? ITS BEEN A THING ON TUMBLR AND THE CLAWS I CANT GET OVER THAT
Monty on 1:16 was a definition of a FNAF retroslop
That’s why they don’t call it five nights at Monty’s
Love this ❤
FINALLY AN MONTEY SONG!!!!>:3
Something only a classic Creator can do
Love the detail of him hitting chica's ball with a club at the start symbolizing he is going to kill chica with a club
HIV negative activity
This scratches my brain
in the window at 1:03 it looks like the mimicc?!?!?!?!?!?!?
2:06 Bottom Left corner has Monty doing the Tenna Dance. This means that either this is a dark world or Deltarune is a video game in the FNAF universe.
How do you get his glasses? before killing Roxy. 1:19
2:07 Monty Dancing Macarena And Gangnam Style 🤣
2:06 love him doing the tenna dance in the bottom left
You're so much nicer than you gotta be A star and part of Freddy's symphony Praise for your ability, charm and creativity (okay) They always liked you so much more than me I think they'd want me, if I got a shot To show I'm more than just a pair of claws Prove that I deserve applause Practice 'til I'm good because I think the band could have an open spot You gotta step on up 'til the spotlight finds your face Step on up 'til you have found your callin' up on center stage You got style, you got ambition, so do whatever it takes Step on in (hey), step on him (hey), step on up (okay) I think I'm finally gettin' over you So can I get another W?

We can all agree monthy is just a btcy selfish robot
BANGER
I like how this song gets right to the point. No long intro, just 💥.
this is ass
Man Monty acts like a real monster in this song
And kiss the clown…!
Tbh, the best monty song ever
1:45 I love when Monty does this sm
El museo va en el arte 🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love this song so much:)
2:07 theres a monty doing the tv time dance
Please make a song of fnaf secret of the mimic
Love the song and animation style❤
This is so fitting!!!
Wicked animation and song.
I remeber the first song of fnaf you ever made…
Me identifiquei
I love this wn8mation
is this Montys past life before he killed glamrock bonnie
Monty is the new william afton.
2:07 THERE'S A MONTY DOIND THE JOIN US FOR A BITE DANCE LOL
The Living Tombstone never misses with FNAF songs
I mean, he was scrapped for half a century from sotm until they finally decided to bring him back in sb. Can you blame him for tryna get the spotlight
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Monty!!!
2:06 THE BURGERKING FNAF DANCE REFRENCE????
Step on him is crazy work ☠️. Freddy didn’t deserve that fr.
Why does his voice sound like monty’s voice way more than the actual monty voice?
This is cannon
Here from a hitpig edit😭
Bro, this is PEAK
Giga Monty 2:08
You need to do a FNAF SOTM!! (This is just to good)
Arte
my favourite TLT song...
This reminds me of Daisies by Black Gryphon
MEGA MONTIES
"You're so much nicer than you gotta be" damn this is already relatable
1:25 epic just epic
People have pointed out Mimic watching in some scenes. Well where’s you think Mimic learned to be a killer from?
I like how Monty changed his design so when Bonnie died he could look like a glamrock
Lol
This man can’t stop making fnaf music and i can’t stop listening to it
This song is genuinely gas
2:07 Love all the little details in this shot. There's even Monty Tenna dancing in the corner. Bro thinks he's John Deltarune
In case you couldn’t read the lyrics on the video  You're so much nicer than you gotta be A star and part of Freddy's symphony Praise for your ability, charm and creativity (okay) They always liked you so much more than me I think they'd want me, if I got a shot To show I'm more than just a pair of claws Prove that I deserve applause Practice 'til I'm good because I think the band could have an open spot You gotta step on up 'til the spotlight finds your face Step on up 'til you have found your callin' up on center stage You got style, you got ambition, so do whatever it takes Step on in (hey), step on him (hey), step on up (okay) I think I'm finally gettin' over you So can I get another W?

THIS SOUNDS LIKE A BROADWAY SONG IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE 🔥🔥🔥🗣🗣🗣
Is the next album gonna be armstrong
I told my friend Monty sounded like pig from barnyard and ruined the song for him
1:37 the catchlights in her eyes make it look like she's crying :(
Something tells me Monty’s popularity is about to step on up
"Monty Within"
Is this Canon?
Legit this sounds just like Long Time Friends!!! Heck yeah!!! Love this Monty Song!!!! Legit Banger!!!
PARTY TIME!!
Just occurred to me that this is the first and so far only fan song TLT has posted in the green era.
Fully ingrained in my childhood now
I saw the mimic!
I got no time
Bro K-O'ed Roxy with a whole go-cart, man.💀
Cory would die if he saw this😅😂
Found this song because of a metal sonic anamatic! Literally went so perfectly with metal sonic taking out the real sonic that I genuinely thought that’s what the song would be about!? I freaking love this so much❤❤❤❤
Bro this show just shows how much rage issues Monty has 😂😂
2:06
Step on Him!
This sounds familiar
Reminds me of the "Daisies" song about Alastor
This is cool, but is it lore accurate?
See you guys in like 7 years when this song becomes a Tik Tok trend😭
I love you guys songs i listen to them on this app synthesia and they sound so good thanks for making my day great
I was here!
that's too giga for that monty
TUFF.
i think this song has singlehandedly made myself a Monty fan
My ordinary life still on top
Hi (sorry for bad English)
no wonder envy is one of the seven deadly sins
2:06 I see Monty doing the mixamo tenna dance
i see the mimic
RIP Bonnie
the animation is good
❤❤❤
This is peak
I think I'm going to start hating Monty more than before after this, I'm sorry! 😭
2:06 giga monty
NOICE
What I like most about the lyrics of this song is that you can apply it to any envious villain and you will find the words describe him perfectly.
😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑
Rooster can be more like make a cat versus cast like Bonnie or Freddy
What if Gregory was in the suit 1:49
Wow I haven’t heard a good Fnaf song in a long time thank you
I've listened to this at least 60 times by now and it's still fantastic
HOW BIG WAS THE BUDGEEET no, HOW MUCH SKILL CAN YOU HAVE, like daaam great song great animation, GREAT everything
I honestly really like this portrayal of Monty, he's not even that aggressive, but instead actually scheming and clever!! This may make him seem like a worse guy, but a MUCH better villain!!!
0:34 he just wanted to join the band for recognition and had LEGIT hope, but at this point he just doubled down and thought his only shot at it was to TAKE OUT Bonnie!!
This is not an OG Fnaf song if you want that listen to I am the purple guy
yo do NOT show this to Coryxkenshin💀
This song is so ahh I'm Sr ts but your songs are so much better than this you do good at songs but this one is not one of the good ones
nooooo not glamrock bonnie oh a hilousanation😊
The music is very good and I love that Bonnie was in the band before :]
clanker genocide
so I guess this is how Monty killed glamrock Bonnie
Rocketfish sings a song.
Coryxkenshin would be mad if he sees this
I watched this 5 times
Why did you do this after making a song about how you didnt need to make a song again for this
2:07 oh yeah tv time oh yeah
“YA KNOW WHAT THEY SAY!  Can’t beat em, break em.” — Monty probably.
As soon as I heard this song it was my favourite not just fnaf song but my favourite song ever!
Ive listened to this on repeat for 4 times now, I already wish that I can listen and watch this for the first time again, ABSOLUTE CINEMA.
sun and moon dont exist in this universe apparently
yet another banger
Bir grubun şarkıları hiçmi kötü olmaz maşallah tekrardan bir şaheser çıkarmışsınız
Me when Chucky cheese
I thought when they say "step on up"I thought they ment like get on the stage it actually means step on Bonnie.
The song in the background at the beginning and a bit farther sound like another song done by them or the blackgriffins
This song is unironically pretty inspiring/uplifting
1:41 this part is so stunning
So yeah!👏
I loved it! Great job living tombstone and keep working hard. It would be a shame for you to stop.
I love the song
So good
I can hear Coryxkenshin approaching his location
It's funny how it took a kid to destroy Monty
AWESOME song! Hope to see more and maybe songs of the smiling critters and nightmare critters too! Please?
This would be great if security breach had this in mind instead of wtf ye got
yesss i wanted a new fnaf song but this rockss
Everything is so cool
Is so cool
Monty gator I will always love you, even with your alleged crimes that were never confirmed or unconfirmed
E
I ship Monty x Bonnie
Yooooo this is sick
You can see the quality increase from the first fnaf song
I love it. It's a good story, song and music video.
The end is basically just a normal AstralSpiff SB stream, with Giga Monty everywhere!
That was great, Monty is awesome 🤩👏🏽💚⭐️💚⭐️💚⭐️💚⭐️💚⭐️
0:57 CLANK BANG BOP
I SAW HIM DO THE  TENNA DANCE
1:03 the mimic chillin in da window
HELLO THE TENNA DANCE
yo love the animation and song that really does step on in and step on him a and step on up
I can't get this outta my head bro 😭🥹🥹
Can anyone tell me what type of magic is happening in that bridge that starts in 1:16
Spamton got a BIG SHOT by Tenna who tried to kill him… :)    (To have context, search “step on up spamton”, you’ll normally find an animated video by Faz)
its been 11 years and yall still make peak music
Omg the living tombstone is coming back to bless our ears 🔥
1:15 is literally my thoughts on how i want to be one of the greatest like the because I want them to love me like, I see them love you.....
Montgomery Gator enjoyers:
This was Monty’s original plan he only was able to get to glamrock Bonnie before Gregory snapped him in half. They still all got ruined anyways
This ain’t fnaf sb ruin, but I’ll take it
Tiving tombsne create song fnaf 6 plis l m fan
Bro be dancing like tenna
Monty deserve a song for being the least favorite animatronic
I have not watch this channel since few years and still awesome
Giving me everybody makes mistakes vibes
0:34 I thought he said step on me 😭
1:16 se parece un poco a Elvis Presley jajajaja😂
Cool song but worst comment section ever🥀💔
Step on up
Montys really greedy for his spotlight
0:53 that was cold man holy shit😭✌️
this looks like some thing made by steel wool studios tbh
This feels like the first song in like a FNAF late-2000s Disney Movie
no way it's giga Monty
Monty really seizing his moment, yeah?
at 1:16 the tone of the song changes to a different song sorta beat is this a reference to another song
If Corey is Watching this his going to hate him more 🤣
its so good ;,3
1:03 OH SHIT IT'S THE MIMIC
It's had an amazing vibe to it plus anyone notice not only the Monty spinning on his head but he also hit that ACDC guitar play in the end
0:58 So literally no one is gonna talk about how this fits so perfectly
2:07 giga monty reference??!!?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Lol
WHAT THE CREW😭😭😭 Monty’s like *kills Bonnie* STEP ON UP
Somehow I didn’t listen this song for a while but now that I have it so good help I can’t stop listening to it
Can someone tell me why when I was watching a different video when it ended it showed me this but the thumbnail was the c00lkidd party skin from forsaken
Found this through a Sonic animation
Les reto a hacer una mala cancion
Can you make FNaF 1 song Reprise?
FANTASTIC
Yes new song
Catchy[good fnaf song]
What happened to i cant fix you girl 😭
2:07 THE MIMIC!
1:16 THIS PART IS SO GOATED 🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
how do you mfs never fucking miss
2:07 Why are there giga Monties?
They released another banger🤍
I just noticed that he didn't just steal the glasses from Roxy, he also stole the shoulder guards and pants from Chica.
The real question I'm thinking about is if Monty could actually take them all out in that fast of seconds?
Am i the only one that feels that this couldve happened if gregory didnt come in
67
OH MY PEAK
1:16  He strikes me as a hot Disney villain in this scene
Make A animated show about it
Glamrock Bonnie: dies The other Glamrocks: are we missing someone?
This is a certified hood classic 🔥
1:02 THE MIMIC! HE'S IN THE WINDOWS!!!!!!!
Está canción tiene aura
The animators are going crazy with this one
So basically Monty goes through a yandere phase. Okay.  Edit: oh ok nvm, MORE than a yandere phase.
YESSS
ES DEMASIADA  E S E N C I A 🗣🗣🗣‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
how did you make it look so good?
Back to the roots. I love it❤❤❤
Monti is the best ❤❤
Is ralsei a girl or boy idk what the hell most characters in deltarune are
Originally thought that this was gonna be cringe, but The Living Tombstone never disappoints! Very great song, and props to whoever voiced Monty!
This song has that 2015 Era vibe. I think they’ve been studying their older songs to capture that energy  Edit: I’ve replayed this Music Video an unhealthy amount of times.
2:07 I like how there's a random Clean-O-Vac amoungst the chaos that was encountered by one of the Wet Floor Signs
MY GOAT IS FINALLY GETTING THE ATTENTION HE NEEDS 🤩 anyway, this is peak fnaf music at its finest.
1:38 The way he kills Roxy is so goddamn funny to me.
I love the outfit Monty had in the beginning it shows that the gator in SOTM looked liked Monty so they made him have that outfit to make it canon that the gator IS Monty this was really good
Cory's worst nightmare:
0:40 my fav part
astralspiff referenced
Temazo 🍷🗿
i love the nod at 0:15
Does anyone remember the echo from Crusher-P
w
Giga Monty...
Honestly, my fav song
No way, new FNAF release?  Let’s gooooooo!
at 0:10, you see the golfballs get hit in the order the members (minus bonnie) get taken out. chica first, then roxy, and freddy's left for last.
oh thats gore.. thats gore of my comfort character..... oh ....
found this trough a spamton fan animation
My favorite song is absolute music ✋😿🤚,Bro I watched this song 46 TIMES TODAY ALONE

its too good
Me being the most coldhearted being possible(In my head, I'm a coward)
THE VOICE IS ADDICTING
Eh
Really good song! I was laughing in my mind at the end as Monty was daydreaming 😂
Reminds me of that foxy song Noticed, I love it
Cory is NOT happy abt this😭
I can see why there's so many furries today. Ts was just EVERYWHERE geez.
WAKE UP LIVING TOMBSTONE POSTED…. Wait this was 2 weeks ago
2:07 was... was that the giga monty horde?
why is the audio more quiet than normal
it's cool
i love 1:58 . the guitar sounds so FIRE❤‍🔥
It's great! I just wish it wasn't so quiet, I have to turn my volume up so much when it comes on in the playlist
2:07
Love the part where he was innocent then KILL
This is a love letter to Monty, what a good song 🐊🐊🐊
I don't know why the tone reminds me of  "Daisies"
monty poses
0.95 speed sounds like it's supposed to be the og speed of the song lowk
At least he didn't get sun and moon!
The living tombstone never fails to disappoint me ✌️😔
AMOOOOOOOOOOOO ESTA CANCIONNNNNN LOO AMOOO 💗💗🎉🎉🎉🎉
actual gas
After 5 years or more the goat himself came back
Make a uzi doorman song and it would be cool!!?!?!?!?! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Feeling like 2015 with this one 🗣️
W song
I like On the Other side (Into the pit) and Stuck inside and aswell as this.
Deltarune Tenna reference???? 2:07 in the bottom left corner
1:58  "EYE can't see LOL💔💔" Ain't no way you gotta disrespect Roxy like that bro
1:11 that tail swing looked kindaaaaa
انيميشنك تطور سار احلا بمراحل
1:55 Me and my stupid ahh brain, "PRETTY SOON YOU'LL BE PUSHING UP DAISIES WHERE THE SUN DON'T SHINE. HA!"
Lo único malo de esta canción esque no le pueda subir más el volumen 😔
Can I get another W had me rolling for nor good reason LOL
Holy who made this
1:59 "Eye can't see" and "Strike" 2:00 He wrote "Give me back my eyes" on Roxy. I love the little easter eggs 😂
This song is so much catchier than i thought itd be!
I love all the Glamrocks, so watching Monty kill them all traumatize me. The song was good I'm not going to lie but the animation....... Also Two thing I want to add: 1. I watch from Twisted Animatronic made a theory that Monty DID NOT kill Glamrock Bonnie. 2. Because I love all the animatronics I'll need to have a serious talk with Monty. I see them all as friends, family, and their therapist.
Ok this was amazing ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Thank you living tombstone youve done it again
2:07 GIGA MONTY MENTIONED!!
2:07 Giga Monty
thats how it became ruined
I think this is AMAZING THE ANIMATION IS SMOOTHER
“Burning pen weighting gif”
The amount of hatred Cory would have if he react to this animation 😭    Overall y'all killed it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
popular kid vs. new popular kid
Wait until bro Meets Gregory in the rides- it’s over😭
Temazo
You're so much nicer than you gotta be A star and part of Freddy's symphony Praise for your ability Charm and creativity (Okay) They always liked you so much more than me I think they'd want me, if I got a shot To show I'm more than just a pair of claws Prove that I deserve applause Practice 'til I'm good because I think the band could have an open spot  [Chorus: McGwire, McGwire & Sam Haft] You gotta step on up 'til the spotlight finds your face Step on up 'til you have found your callin' up on center stage You got style, you got ambition, so do whatever it takes Step on in (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), step on up (Okay!)  [Verse 2: McGwire] I think I'm finally gettin' ovеr you So can I get another W? I get what I'm ovеrdue Pay me in exposure, too As long as nobody discovers you See, you can hide, but you can't hide from me I'll never say no to my destiny You bring out the best of me I'll say, "Open sesame" To all the obstacles ahead of me You might also like  [Chorus: McGwire, McGwire & Sam Haft] You gotta step on up 'til the spotlight finds your face Step on up 'til you have found your callin' up on center stage Oh, Bonnie boy, you're such a gas, but it's my turn to play Step on in, (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), step on up (Okay!)  [Bridge: McGwire, McGwire & Sam Haft] Out in the limelight Everyone sees you I think that I might just wanna be you Hearin' them love me just like I see them love you If I control my destiny, I know what I must do, oh  [Chorus: McGwire, McGwire & Sam Haft] Step on up 'til you've finally found your place Step on up 'til every boy and girl is chantin' out your name Dear Freddy, it ain't personal, but you are in the way Step on in (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), and him, and him, and him, and him Step on in (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), step on up (Okay!)  [Instrumental Break]  [Outro: McGwire] Thank you, and goodnight
Biggest cory ragebaiter btw💔🥀
Finally new fnaf song
ojolero seto fredy fasber  or or or or or or or or oooooooorrrrrrr or or or or or or or or
I love that as Monty merks the other animatronics his outfit goes from his old one to his upgraded one.
it's a good song
Monty mole
Never thought I would say but I was the first one to see this
Finally a good Security breach song I can enjoy 😭🔥
_[LITTLE SPONGE], i'll step up to the [HEAVEN'S BLUE LIGHT SPECIAL], and be a [BIG SHOT!]_
Came here from a spamton animation
0:40  I love this shot for some reason
This gives me TADC vibes
I know CG5 will make a cover.
Great song.
This is why I hate Monte. The alligator he destroyed Bonnie. He replaced him and he made everyone. Think that Bonnie just gave him the role. Why does Monte have to be so jealous That became evil
seeing the original animation on tiktok about a year ago to now seeing it in your official music video just feels perfect in a way 🙏
Omg another song it been a long time 🎉🎉
Cory would despise this one😅
0:57 that part of Monty hitting Bonnie was brutal
POV: your playing the giga monty mod 2:07
Wow the Peakness of this song while Monty kills everyone 🎉
This reminds me of that one Gumball episode where Tobias is like: "There can only be one!"
Didn’t know this was a fnaf song until I searched it up lol
Alguien le puede decir a the living Tomsobstone que deje de hacer música tan buena 🗣️🔥🔥‼️
2:10  is that scene a reference to the Monty army glitch
I can’t believe I slept on this recommended  Giga monty army 2:07 astralspiff would be proud
It's giving "Oh, this songs gonna be an animation meme"
Hiting harder then my entire family
I thought the living tombstone was dead till he made this song
Yet again, you make such a banger that I will listen to constantly, your my superstar  Living Tombstone!! :3
Nice
A
Wow dude it's perfect and so cool i love fnaf
I like how this song sound, good beat. It reminds me of some other old song, but I can't remember which one... Does anyone have any suggest? Hmm...
WE ARE SO BACK!
TS IS PEAK🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Me recuerda Monty Ami animación infantil 😢
Супер пупер
Через 5-10 лет это будут переслушивать куча раз
Heh, this kinda 50s jazz likeish but its good, lol
Felt like a GigaMonty reference at the end there
Make it longer plz
Bonnie was just bouncing around and vibing and being sweet 😭 MY SHAYYYYLAAA
the wet floor sign bots are so adorable
Me core:
MONTY MY FAVORITE
okk guys i hope you doont mind if ill make something like test remake on your animation but on mobile phone in Prisma 3d
Play the video speed 2x 1:45
Were waiting for roxy replaces roxy song hits hard
0:58 the glass break with the ball synced to the beat was perfect
the singer sounds like Monty to be honest
i like it how in monty's room (in this room) u can see the fan from fnaf
As a Monty fan this was fire
AMOOOO
As a monty fan i absolutely loved this
Monty just killeds
I like this song I’m 10 years old. I’m a kid. I’m a boy.
I like this song also on my kid I’m 10 years old
i love how this was all montys imagination
We have made it so far in fnaf animation
This song is so cool!!!
It looked lore actucurate at the start but later it just becomes crazy😂
This was gold magic! :D
me telling my kids this was a classical song in 30 years but it’s not a classical song:
Very playful! I LOVE IT :D
Still thinking his signature song is Man Areas😅
This song came out the day me and my ex broke up.
You need to do mimc to
This is actually pretty accurate considering monty did destroy the blue glam bonnie and in one of the mini games freddy was in a dumpster while monty had his place. But never tool out roxane or chica. Why? Because he destroyed glam bonnie and glam freddy not for fame but because he was acting on gator instincts and trying to be the alpha male.
fire
This is absolute PEAK!!! I love Monty and this song is so vibey and fun!
Amazing animation and song as always
People 5 years later be calling this nostalgic
Honestly Monty would do this for fame tho
2:07 GIGA MONTY WAS MENTIONED
*Monty💕
This video audio sound is very low
I dont know what they put into this song but ive had it on replay for days straight, and at this pace I'll have it memorized by the end of the month.
IM OBSSESED WITH THISSS, i hear it at least one time everyday
i think this the best music for my concert piano i like this songg omggg
I deadass never thought about what Monty did while Bonnie was still around.
Uhhhh I did not do this?!😳
Whats the music genre called??
Love the astro spiff reference with gigamonty
Absolutely amazing🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm calling it. This song will be extremely nostalgic in around 7 years from now.
The collab I didn't know I needed 🤩🤩🤩
Good song
Animatronical homicide is not tolerated
Peak
WOAAAAAA, ESTA HERMOSO!!!!!!!!!! De verdad amamos tus canciones <33
This is what selfishness brings
w
Hey
ANIMATION IS FIRE AND I LOVE THE MUSIC😊
Si quiera es posible que hagan una canción mala?
This makes me smile. It reminds me of all the specific characters songs back I around 2016
PEAK
McGwire partnering with TLT?! Amazing. Glad to see him getting bigger.
1:03 I don't understand what is that in the upper lower corner?
honestly thought you were done doing fandom music, which I wouldn't complain about, but this is nice though!
I feel so bad for the wet floor bots. They are forced to watch and run but can't save any of the original band.
Cada día me siento como Monty
otro temaso de the living tubstom
2:00 Honestly, were they expecting him to come quietly?
If they play this at a concert then i better see people wearing monty onesies
The comeback is crazy
Amigo porque no entiende que Godzilla se soleá a todos lo titanes
COME TO COSTA RICA PLEASE ❤
0:55 Well that's trama inducing being your fan favorite character get killed infront of you, it's like in the movie "It" when the kid in the maze gets killed infront of a guy on the glass.
I honestly adore the way he slams the bowling ball into Bonnies head
The first time I heard this song my older sibling was playing it in the car and I head 'step on me'.
Giga monty
The instrumental sounds so familiar but I can’t put my finger on it, maybe it’s a Epotch type beat. But yeah this is just amazing!
Lol😊
Es posible que no hagan buena música muy buena re god
🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊
“Step on up, ‘till the spotlight finds your face.”  I don’t think the spotlight is gonna find Bonnie’s any time soon.
Speed 1.25 sounds pretty good
1:58 i feel like im the only one here hearing "im a bun im a bun im a tasty tasty bun" 😭
Now this feels like something made in 2014 or 2015
I Love the touch at the end of Monty saying "G'night" because hes southern. its little representation like that that charms me. (Source, im southern and its always always "G'night")
This song proves that it was Monty killed a Bonnie.
This one song did more for Monty's character than the actual game 😂
WTF They are everywhere!!!😱😱😱😱
Smh… how dare you making such a banger song just for me to have it stuck in my head since days 🙄😆
This is a great song! I was not expecting this to be a classical fnaf song. And this is like the perfect song that fits Monty! Great job, man!
1:04 The Mimic?
I love this Song!! And the Animation makes it EVEN better!! ❤
Make another one about Monty but him hunting Gregory or hunting with more rock music to it 😂
This song has been stuck in my head on repeat
is it just me who noticed the mimic was here? 1:02 at the top left
,,🇵🇪🇵🇪🇵🇪🇵🇪🥲🥲💚
Monty did not kill Bonnie
Monty is my fav animatronic
LITERALLY every single FNAF song TLT makes is a downright banger
Por mais que o personagem seja paia, a música é boa dms
hace cover de queen😎
Good song
I WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO WATCH THIS!!!
Average clanker crash out
Imagine if he actually killed them.😨
Whoa 1:00
Missed opportunity for a bass solo 😔
My favorite part chat 1:44
some clarity for what Monty took: - Bonnie's guitar - Chica's pants - Roxy's glasses - Freddy
Did anyone else notice that on the Bonnie poster at the start it ways "to Monty, rock on buddy!" That's sad as hell
ME LOVE IT! Too bad its kinda blocked at school. Living tombstone you are cooking. I love youre music. I also love how the ragdoll of bonnie getting killed by monty. It's funny and good.
Hay una canción de esta banda sobre fnaf que no salga bien!??
At first: YOOO he gonna become one of them!- At the end: Why did he kill everyone...
Is amazing
Its so cool (IM MONTY JAJAJAJA-)
Nooooo why do you kill Bonnie?
im so glad i noticed the one monty doing the tenna dance 😭 i love this so much omg
STEP ON UP 🗣️
Idk why but for me it sounds like a Toy Story song
please make a song for the  amazing digital circus..
why is it so quiet? but else i love the song
0:55 monty wtf
Ty for having me as the voice actor
Is this the bay wire butcher?
Числа
Finally a fnaf ruin song (or at least I think so) if we had to wait a long time... But it was worth it :D
Dude 100/10 man this is my favorite song now 😍❤❤❤❤
1:29 that shot was epic
Holy peak
It was about making a song, not a masterpiece.
Why does it slightly sound like Jshlatt
Great song .... to quiet
Ngl, I first thought heard this from Spotify and saw Monty rampaging on Freddy’s statue and then rocking on, so I thought it was like an inspirational song  of how Monty got his spot especially with all the “step on up”s, but then I watched this and I’m like, Oh.
0:44 why bro have demomans taunt???😂
Monty is are real monster
El final no me lo esperaba
Good example of what could happen if AI will get too angry
This fits with Billy Bob from Showbiz Pizza Place just killing the Chuck E Cheese characters
Monty, you'll never be as loved as Bonnie was.
whats the genre of the music? :D
I thought Freddy have a fight with Monty
PEAK ANIMATION 🔥
Everyone sees the mimic behind the green screen? 2:05 JSDKFKJK
I love the map bots interaction with Monty
2:07 look behind the greenscreen
Song is so banger that I watched it over 100 times
mi favorito de fnaf security Breche es Monty 🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊
I could also see foxy singing this.
woa. The animation is so expressive! Golden.
Now I want a Monty x Louis (Princess and the Frog) jazzy duet song
absulotamente cine
I appreciate the little touch where the golf ball has Chica's head on it and he ultimately uses a golf club to dispose of her later. So that's cool.
this will sound in heaven?🐊🐰
Am I the only person that noticed that Monty destroyed everyone except the daycare attendant
I've seen this at school yesterday and it was amazing❤
I love the multiple Montgomery Gators absolutely reeking havoc on the Pizzaplex 😂
🐊
SOLO 137MIL? Likes
i love monty sm lmao
You should make a song about nosy after he’s finished
Is no one gonna talk about that Gator do the tv Time dance at 2:07
Can't stop vibing to this and the visuals are insane even compared to hollywood animation standards
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Does anyone notice that Monty changes appearances during the  parts when he killed everyone
1:55 referencia a Daises de Black Gryph0n ??
The fact that in one part there’s many Monty’s, referencing his GIGA Monty glitch in security breach LOL
Monty could have just learned drums…
what is ts
1:00 F for glamrock Bonnie
It's song a perfect❤
I created a direct ripoff of Derry Girls called Eilidhtnihuntsdin Girls
It’s like a full journey of envy, then jealousy, then destruction to get
Soo perfect!!!
Monty forever
He's jealous because markiplier laughed at him 3 minutes
You're so much nicer than you gotta be A star and part of Freddy's symphony Praise for your ability Charm and creativity (Okay) They always liked you so much more than me I think they'd want me, if I got a shot To show I'm more than just a pair of claws Prove that I deserve applause Practice 'til I'm good because I think the band could have an open spot     RTB MB & RTB Capo 'Hawaii' Lyrics & Meaning | Genius Verified  [Chorus: McGwire, McGwire & Sam Haft] You gotta step on up 'til the spotlight finds your face Step on up 'til you have found your callin' up on center stage You got style, you got ambition, so do whatever it takes Step on in (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), step on up (Okay!)

[Instrumental Break]  [Outro: McGwire] Thank you, and goodnight
I love how this song is basically Monty's power fantasy lol.
That first "Step on Him!" reminded me wtf happens to Glamrock Bonnie...
SO GOOD👍👍
at 1:03 (at the window) and at 2:06 (behind the green screen) the mimic appear
Another banger another day
Freddy: hoo de doooo Monty: *jumps him* Freddy: MONTY TF
updoot!
This has some CRAZY soul! It's like I'm in church
More indie horror game song
that bonnie poster is sick af can i buy one
My favorite line is "I think I'm finally getting over you,  so can I get another W?"
THEY REFERENCED THE MONTY ARMY GLITCH
New ass fnaf song Is kind of cool
Do NOT let @CoryxKenshin see this
just make a movie at this point this is fire like u could lowk make like a diney style movie maybe even better take this advice
these fnaf song animations fit the whole community  check edit: im not a bot btw dont comment “bot” plssss
Song  tuff
Wow man I love your songs this one is so catchy and just AWESOME
0:19 what are those lights called?
am i the only one who dont like this song?
Love how Monty changes a bit from the rest of gang after they have been destroyed
2:06 Anyone notice he did the burger king tiktok meme
Close enough, welcome back smile HD
Erratic clanker murdering something more than bolts
Already a banger
Ah yes, sudden music videos about a random fnaf character being masterpieces, they're my favorites
Jabones siguen los games monkey and me gusta❤❤😂😂🎉
Mimic in the back 1:02
stop making BANGERS
There's only two ways that make sense it has to be the staff bot or Monty because we do see parts scatter around
I love it because there's a Monty doing the ten a dance
if you go back to when bonnie is killed you can see chica's green room, which in SB Monty's room is right next to her room. Don't know if this is intended, but it is just a cool little detail
The living tombstone Never disappoints
He's finally back
lore of giga monty
Don’t ask why I listened to this song over 16 times💀💀💀
"Dear Freddy, it ain't personal" *Proceeds to rip Freddy from the inside out*
0:18
WTF how dare you unsubscribe guys?
I think Monty was genuienly inspired by Bonnie's success, but envy and jealousy drove him to commiting mass murder
BRO WOW!!!
It’s so good 🤩🤩🤩
The animation is nothing but gorgeous. Truly Amazing
1.25x speed is fire 🔥
Bro this is very catchy love your work thelivngtombstone 👍👍
That Bonnie design is God tier
😍The Living Tombstone, always doing amazing FNAF songs. 🤔 Seems that the time didn't change your talent!
This is Alive song among dead music…2025 phonk
Yo I can’t wait to watch this!- Monty: *Kills everyone*
No Bonnie i hate his
what he wanted versus what he got:...
new!!
xd
epic song!
Honestly, really good song i wish it went for longer 😂
Tbh I would also be pissed if everyone had cool and colorful designs while I looked like a average farmer from the 2000s
Honestly hillbilly Monty is so cute
This song is too good
This song really reminds me of Narcissistic Personality Disorder, and how narcissists see the world, having to climb that ladder at all costs
i think that sound too small
2:07 Is that a Clean-O-Vac?
THE MUSIC THE ANIMATION THE EVERYTHINGGGG UGHHH I LOVE THIS SO MUCH.
It was his imagination
Step on up
My personal ttheory is that Montys fantasy remains that way till the glitchtrap virud, which is why the "Step on Up" in the beginning is purple because he is being influenced to take that extreme measure
Monty stop we're your friends
Arlo the singing crocodile
GIGA MONTYYYYY
Am I the only one who thought that the multiple Monty’s could have been based on the Monty glitch?
This is amazing
Another fire song as usual 🐊👑
Meanwhile:  Sundrop and Moondrop wondering why its so quiet all a sudden and where the others are..
what is that thing in the window at 1:04 ?
Well damn, I definitely wasn't expecting this!!
@coryxkenshin
Dios me encanta esta canción, no se sale de mi cabeza por días
It is good but it is too quiet for me
WAIT YALL AINT SEEING THE MIMIC BEHIND THE GREEN SCREEN????!??
Ame esta canción, ¿pero podrían subirle un poquito el volumen?, incluso al 100 suena algo bajo Fuera de eso es una canción fantástica.
cool broo
Anger issues/=Monty
The amount of times I’ve listened to this is scary
Montys just misunderstood. Also monty:
this video sold me on monty’s story with bonnie wtf
Very good ❤
Fnaf if micheal never made his brother kiss the bear
Hey [Monty Gator] I can make you a [Big Shot]… You just have to make a deal and follow it…
Killed it with the animation
2:06 how cute i see one of the wet signal interacting with one of edwin's vacuum
ЖИВОЕ ЖИВОЕ ОНО ЖИВОЕ ОНО ОНО... ОНО НОВАЯ МУЗЫКА
Im addict to this songggggg
Beautiful song, very good song 👍
STEP ON UPPP
When they release a song from secret of the mimic
If the end wasn’t there this would be the Giga Monty origin story
you gotta step on up
La escena de glamrock Bonnie es escalofriante
1:23 HE TOOK HIS PANTS OFF
Monty was consumed by darkness?!
Monty got so obsessed with being a big shot he went insane over it Reminds me of someone… I just can’t quite put my finger on it🕶️
thankyou for reminding me at how monty are my least favorite character  <3
1 000 000 000 / 10 ☺️👍
In my opinion it is a very good song that shows Monty's past.
0:00 this is already so awsomesauce
0:19 I loved this look of his 💚
ОЧЕНЬ КРУТАЯ РАБОТА 😮😮😮😮 ВЫ БОЛЬШОЙ МОЛОДЕЦ
2:07 GIGA MONTY
This song is eerily chilling, but it’s a fucking bop like if you listen to some of the lyrics with the background song, it has a upbeat chilling
MY GLORIOUS KING MONTY
Não sei pq eu estou sentindo nostalgia por algo que eu nunca vivi ou presenciei.
Is gator cooking Freddy?
Goofy aah banger
2:07 good god it’s giga monty
crab mentality but the crab actually got claws lmao
DAYUMMMM
2:07 the montylings
Put any song in swing and you’ll win me over. THIS SOUNDS SO AMAZING
*Goofy Disney ahhh villain song* btw the song is good as usual thanks TLT
IM SO GLAD MONTY DIDNT ACTUALLY KILL THEM😅
Bro when montey killed rocksan i heard gotcha bitch and it couth me loagthing
2:07 i saw monty doin the gagnam style lol.
So many good songs this week omg
PEAKKKK
2:00 “  give me back my eyes”-roxy
If sb was good
A law of the universe is that lc will always return to fnaf
Did anyone catch Monty doing the gangnam style?
Love the swing style. This kind of beat just slams for me.
I kinda want to see someone do a mashup with this song and daisies ngl
He's still dropping bangers like a bombs in 2025 this is beautiful
El cleanbot con el clean o vac de fondo me encanto😂
Literally the Freddy's kill was personal bro 💀
I have always loved your music and this makes me want to hear what else you have for this character
Que buena canción
Love that he never thought about going to the daycare
objection, freddy would fry monty's ass
I was taking a log in the toilet listening to this
Man, The giga Monty mentioned in the background dx.
2:07 Whats giga monty doing here? :3
Getting this notification is great
I swear this song is way too good also TLT im making a animation of this song fnaf sb if that fine😅 of plain paper...😂 i think it would suck
the animation is CRAZY GOOD AND SMOOTH in this  the two times that the hits match the song makes it so much better  and also the bits where his voice sounds a little raspy also gives it a nice charm, I actually like it a lot
i see the clean-o-vac from sotm made an appearance 2:07
YOOO, THE LIVING TOMBSTONE ALWAYS PUTTIN FNAF BANGERS IN OUR MINDS LIKE KYLE ALLEN🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
detail: theres a signed thing that says ‘knock em dead, son! -dad’…. he certainly did that alright
2:07 THE MIMICS BEHIND THE GREEN SCREEN
Mintyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Giga monty was taken too real 2:07
i like this song thanks the living tombstone i love you nice
Wow
I love how this came out of nowhere lol
Woah
This suspiciously sounds a lot like The bidding by Tally Hall
The fnaf song legends
I loved the animation and especially the song, it's very good!
A plot in a musicvideo is next Level 😂🤩
Alligator rule the scene 🐊.
GIGI MONTIESSS MENTION!!!!!!
This is a pretty good song , the thing is a lot of living tombstone songs are great , but every now and again there one song that specifically stand out because of how great it is , but like I said , all living tombstone songs are really just great .
Step on me
Почти каждый день слушаю этот трек 💚💚💚
So that’s who ruined the Pizza plex
2:08 MONTY ARMY!!!
I keep watching this
I can see why they call him “Green With Envy”
Anyone else see that refrence to 'die in a fire' at 1:54?
I love this so much and we need songs for the other Glamrocks 😂❤
Incredible the masterpiece a maniac can pull off❤
am i  the only one who sees the vacume cleaner from edwin on 2:07
people will look at this song in 4 years or something,and be nostagic,and from today,its only been realesed 9 days ago
Could we get a textless version? I really wanna do the edit but the words are super distracting from the song I’m using—   Amazing animation!! Super well done and the song is superb!!!
This song hits hard 🎉🔥🔥🔥
OMG.  AS ALWAYS, IT'S MAGNIFICENT. I LOVE MONTY
Honestly one of the best vocal performances I've ever heard
I cant wait until this becomes classic and it becomes used for edits
wow this makes better use of monty then the entirety of the glamrock sb era...
Don't worry monty, you're always gonna be my favorite
Clean animation
Мне очень нравится когда группа выходит за кулисы. Их взаимодействия весьма очаровательны
I like how much of a monster Monty becomes. At the start of the game it already foreshadows him becoming the way he is when you hear him crashing tf out in his room, then he gets his claws stolen, then he gets his knee caps stolen, and it just goes downhill from there until he's a paraplegic maniac
your animations are the inspiration to mine and i really liked it
Wow i love it! Time to listen to it on repeat until i physically cant anymore
llore con este temazo❤
Step On Up~ Step On Up~
Looking back to it, Monty sure has some similarities to William Afton (killing everyone and making sure all is left for himself)
what a fucking banger love it
i don't know how many times i've watched this video by now but it's gotta be at least 20. i adore monty's characterization in this video SO MUCH!!!!! not to mention the animation is incredibly addicting to watch over and over again @_@ monty my #1 forever i love montgomery gator this is possibly the best video ever created
Dang it I was going to make an  animation about this but yours is already perfect
I can only imagine the smell of weeb when they play this at their concert. 😭
Please release an official instrumental
I mean it's not my cup of tea but it's catchy asf 😭😭
Oh holy shit this is really cool! The visuals are amazing
'Bout damn time we got a Monty song!
This. This is what i needed. Feed us more fnaf content holy peak
Sir, may I have another round of this? It’s peak
This animation is pretty good.
Notice in 0:07 he hits a Chica golf and misses But later on He kills her and Hits her head into the trashcan
MONTYSONG MONTY SONG MONTY SONG AHHHHHHHH!!! I am a HUGE Monty fan so i absolutely adore this song.
certified monty crash out
This song is excellent, the only Bad thing, to short 😢
Montey massacre
I like how the top 5 songs are FNAF     and some silly goofy high cat.
I wasted 4 minutes of my life and I loved every second of it
I love this song
Very reminiscent of your old style, easily my favorite of the last couple years
Monty u made a banger
0:57 is the best
Yooooo
Auuughhhh, nooo I can’t let this song and time heal years of Steven universe hate
AHHHHH THIS SONG IS AWESOMEEE!!!
so cool
Querida banda the living tomsbone.Espero que ustedes(the living tomsbone) lean este mensaje, saben, a lo largo de mi vida he vivido feliz en mi vida hasta que llegaron momentos tristes y en los que tenia depre#%on, solo quiero que sepan que vuestra música me ayudo a dar un paso hacia adelante, y que me encantaria que vinieran de gira a España, a Málaga, eso me haría muy feliz, vuestra música me inspiró y me encanta mucho, por cierto, me llamo Lorenzo Moreno Porras y tengo 14 años. Espero que puedan hacerlo. Un saludo.

Unc still got it 😭🫸🫷
Wow  Another great FNAF song from Living Tombstone   Also damn, the animation is absolutely amazing 🤩🤩🤩
Best part 0:59
Yaoi ❤
Was that a giga Monty reference at the end?
The living tombstone have 0 bad songs
Dang it they summoned giga monty
Why Roxy instead of Foxy?
this itches a part of my brain so good, I need more videos like this!! amazing animation and song
MR TOMBSTONE ARE YOU GOING TO THE FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY’S HAUNTED HOUSE AT UNIVERSAL???
the mimic in the bowling alley
1:04 is that the mimic on the up left corner
0:20 0:52 0:56
FNaF Security Breach Will Never Die...
I still can’t get that human Monty out my head
I have to say this video is really done. Good well done leaving tombstone. We can see you in the Detroit, but we will. I’m so excited.
who remembers when there was no most replayed in this video?
*dies of peak*
🔥🔥🔥
That's why Superstar Bonnie isn't there
0:50 actually the cleanest beat drop
Realistically why are people from wealthy backgrounds have the authority over 10 of thousand of people like we have voting for a reason but it’s only to decide who will represent us as a mass and not a individual

[Instrumental Break]  [Outro: McGwire] Thank you, and goodnight
ONE OF THE BEST SONGS I'VE HEARD🔥🔥🔥  I LOVE THE MUSIC OF THE LIVING TOMBSTONE SO MUCH! HIS FNAF SONGS ARE SOME OF THE BEST, I WISH THEY WOULD NEVER END
2 million wiews in 8 days...
The Living Tombstone never misses with their fnaf music. Everything is perfectly on point. Keep it up
More reasons to Hate Monty the video:
Also Monty getting destroyed by a child: 💀
1:44 the aura is suprising here
montgomery gator gangnam style 2:07
living tombstone fnaf is so back
✋😐🤚
❤️
I can’t believe I’m the first person to see this
fnaf songs in 2025❤️‍🩹 AMAZING WORK
when eres la besto parte de la cancion 1:16
I can *NOT* believe the infinitely spawning Monty mod got referenced in a TLT music video.
Absolute cinema
I gotta Make a deep seek al dive about this
When you guys said you were working on a new fnaf song in the tour show in Brazil I thought you guys were joking, can't believe a month later that this actually happened, I can't tell you how honored I was to see you live, really hope you guys come back here next world tour!
2:07 MONTY ARMY!!!!
VERY GOOD SONG!
I got a badge
✋😎🤚 asbolute CINEMA 🥳
Love the animation
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Why did i get a badge😭
Bluddigator thinks this banger about to save his reputation. 🥀.
I haven't commented on the others cuz I was afraid they were going to be the last one and I just want to say thank you for keeping me happy for a couple of years
I've been listening to these songs over and over and you know something I've been here since the very beginning you posted the first of FNAF it's been a long journey I'm turning 16 and this is the only thing that's keeping me cheered up there's a lot of problems with my mom and dad so this is the only thing that's keeping me stable for now I don't think it's going to last a long time though well I better enjoy while it lasts
This is going to be so hard in 10 years
Okay🐊
the living tombstone living  y'all got this song stuck in my head
Another banger FNAF song
And this is my favorite song of living tombstone of all time 🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What do they feed these Fnaf animators? and also TLT making a song of one of my favorite character? I love this song.
i like how this song not only shows monty killing bonnie but also what he would most likely do if he could do that to everyone else.
0:53 such a good beat, honestly startled me first watch lol
Please tell me I'm not the only one who listens to the FNAF song playlist everyday!
God: Make the second coming of a fnaf song Living Tombstone: Yes, my lord Devil: Make it 2 minute long LT: Yes, my lord
This reminds of smile hd alot lol.
Funnest moment of the video 1:55
Step on in step on him STEP ON UP
I love the reference to the multiple Monty glitch
I definitely fw this song
1:58 PLEASE I BEG SOMEONE TO MAKE THIS PART MIXED WITH IM A BUN RICHARD FROM GUMBALL, THE GUITAR PART MADE ME REMEMBERED THE IM A BUN SONG 😭
gigamonty
❤❤❤
I kinda dide with Mont on this one. Nobody likes him sadly.
Bro, monty solo all verse
I feel like this what would've happened if Gregory never came to the pizza plex
I think bro needs to visit Mr hippo
Their animations have really evolved over time! This is soo good.
This song gives me so much of that fnaf era. Amazing work❤
Es cine
Yoav. This is one of your best pieces! You and Sam and McGwire really made an amazing track!
grasias, ahora no puedo dejar de ver a Monty como un estúpido homicida
Can I get permission to make a hour loop video of this?
U godda colab with TADC
Im the first one to watch this video
Epico
Cine 🧐🍷
Only perfect
1:33 - 1:34 Out of context
STEP ON HIM 🐊🔥🔥🔥
YouTube just gave me an achievement for being on the first 2% to watch this when it came out 😂
aaaa
MONTY DIDNT KILL BONNIE: Vanessa aka vanny controlled Monty to kill him!!!!
Hi the living tombstone
temazo
2:06 IS THAT THE TENNA DANCE IN THE LOWER LEFT OR AM I TOO DELTARUNE BRAINROTTED
Что они сделали с моим мальчиком...
NEW BANGER HELL YEAH
PEAAAAAK
Got a badge!
Very good song, stuck in my head..
This song was a banger
♥️
I don’t know how I was in the 0.5 listeners in the living tombstone. I’m so happy that I got a badge. I’m listening to the song now.
It’s a funny song about Monty killing his friends
❤
Come back to Brazil please!!!🇧🇷🇧🇷
STILL MAKING BANGERS!!!
💚
THE ANIMATIO?!?!??!?!M HEEELLOOOOOOO??????????????
I like how the track looks, I like the references like how the animatronics were destroyed in the original game, but the song itself unfortunately doesn't catch on, not a bad chorus but for some reason it didn't catch on, in any case, thanks for the track, and for opening up forgotten memories of the game.
It's the best music I every heard of in my life   10/10🎉
I personally don't believe Monty killed Bonnie, but idc about that rn bc i LOVE this Monty interpretation lmaoooo  Loved the song ^^
Uff temazo🔥
Somewhere in 2030 or smth this will be nostalgic as hell😭
2:07 tv time
2:07 Giga Monty reference? 😁
This is so awesome
Наконец-то кто-то сделал анимацию про одного из моих любимых персонажей из fnaf  прям в приятно от этой песенки стало
holy goated
THIS IS FIREEEEEEEE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Step on up!!!🎉
Discord like instrumental
I can’t even lie, tnis reminds me of JT’s old music style. The beat just sounds nostalgic idk why
Bruh Monty’s face 0:14
para cuando la versión para  roxy,  glamrock chica, glamrock freddy, glamrock bonnie y talvez vannie
WHY AM I PLAYING THIS SHIT ON LOOP FOR LIKE 8 DAYS STRAIGHT!?!?!?!??!?!?
HELL YEAAAAAAAAAA
Me encanta, lit ya la escuche como 20 veces 🫠😛
Whaaaaa definitely worth the wait holy crap this was amazing!!! 🎉
Reference to Die In A Fire? 1:54
Instant clasic. The living tombstone is alergic to make bad songs.
Hi
Rad
0:23 I like how Monty winks at the bots as if they are adoring fans, while they are more concerned about the other bot that got flattened by him 😂
Я обожаю эту песню❤❤
2:07 why is there so many clones of Monty’s!?!?
Average person: “feels so cheery!” Meanwhile Monty proceeds to murder the entire glamrock crew:
this is actually so good. tlt always cooks with fnaf and literally EVERY song. AND MCGWIRE DESERVED THIS SONG AHHH❤❤❤
its a good song just a bot overhyped my opinion
cory is gonna have a fit
This is giving me the alastor song they made vibes
When I call you, you say yes ma’am!!
Hey Evan, it’s me Cassidy I heard you said a bad word but I didn’t want to get you in trouble so I said what did you say?
DUDE THIS IS AMAZING HAVE A SUB BRO 😭
😢😢😂
Heyyy, that was actually pretty good well done. 👏👏👏👏
I think that this song is about the theroy that monty killed Bonnie, This theory is not true, but this timeline, if monty didn't get the fame he wanted, this is what would happen if he actually kill bonnie which he didnt.  Edit:i also wanted to mention there is no Gregory here either so gregory didnt go to the pizza plex, or he is jut a robot which is another theroy.   Just a little theroy of mine :)
dude another instant hit
So that’s why he wants to join
1:34 animatin and sfx desync
BRO IS JEALOUS
Why is there so many Maltese
0:14 'to show im more than just a pair of claws' is so poetic because of him constantly using his claws to kill the other glamrocks
Wait till Cory See's this 😭
I thought it looked really good man
This is the best song
Guys living tombstone is still cooking
But what if Gregory didn't exist and Monty destroyed them all himself and subsequently fell down, losing his legs?
So weil animated
I like it
2:07 was this a Giga Monty Reference? :o
I not like FNAF sb, but this is song gorgeous
Monty is the best
Would you murder your friend for 5 billion dollars Most people: omg never  Me emerging from bros closet: 1:43
34
Pls Make a Gd Song For Us
STEP ON UP, TILL' THE SPOTLIGHT FINDS YO FACE!
WERE SO BACK LIVING TOMBSTONES
TV TIME ON 2:07
Step on up!
The Bowling ball strike is perfectly timed with music.
Oopoh thats why bonnie not in fready fazbear 2:00
Its cool
Awsome! (even if idk what happens in Sb lol)
Another game coming if this guy do a video
Despite seeing so much Monty stuff, I just feel like his apparent underrated-ness is part of the character 😅 This animation is killer!
What If the end was Gregory committing several acts of robotic murder on Monty
In 5 years from now everyone gonna be saying this song was the best and they miss 2025 (even though this years has pretty much gone to shit)
Mm 6/10
The king of fnaf music back!!
I lovet ❤❤❤❤
Ts soooo goooooood, as a fnaf player and a SB player i must say: ¡Step on him!
Gigga monty
ANOTHER FNAF SONG? IM IN HEAVEN
❤❤❤
Love you living tombstone
Watching a video of The Living Tombstone from FNAF is like the first time or the golden age of the internet is something spectacular.
This is lowkey fire
I like how this is just in his imagination bc it hasn’t been confirmed if monty actually destroyed bonnie to take his place but i font think he did bc of how he acts in the books
Poor wet floor sign bots
1:16 en ese momento la canción me encanto completamente
This video showed me how much fun the actual game could've been
This was amazing and also kind of funny lol
Me Atrapaste es Cine ✋🍷🗿🤚✨🎵🎶🎵🐊
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎊🎊
This band is the best for the music and nostalgia
🙂= 🙂 me
absolute banger
We are ALL stepping on up
I LOVE THIS
god this is SUCH a good song. i find it interesting how he says it "ain't personal", yet his attack on freddy is the most violent, involved, and passionate
What happened to Monty 💀
Living tombstone lost its touch
The man's brutal. But no whole seriousness, we don't really know what causes Bonnie's Injuries and decommission.
YO CHILL OUT. I JUST HIT PLAY AND STARTED HEARING PEAK GIVE ME A CHANCE TO REACT TO IT AT LEAST
"you cannot lose the race if all the other racers have their knees broken"    -some guy some time
Monty Glitch Mentioned!
Why can't we go back in time?
AA THIS IS FIREE
Mais uma pedrada do The living Tombstone
absoulute killing
I love fnaf (⁠ ⁠◜⁠‿⁠◝⁠ ⁠)⁠♡
The only bad part in the song, its when it ends😭
HOLY CRAP 😱 never expected another Fnaf video😁
this song feels like something hazbin made from a hotel
Okay now this is my opinion but Freddy's death was the coolest
2:07 HOLY SHIT HE'S DOING THE TENNA DANCE
This guy trying his best to keep fnaf alive ☠️ and I can't fix you is 8 years old and is still alive ☠️
This song its sooo good.
Me recuerda a la canción daisies de Black Gryph0n
Might be the fnaf song of the summer?
1:20 bro the “I might” is my favorite part
Look what that monty is doing in front of thr green screen 2:07
guh hyh
so if this was just monty's imagination this means this takes place in a good future of fnaf sb, since that stuff never happened
So step on up to the plaaate-! Oh wait, wrong song, sorry.
this song is so good 😭

Monty pizzaplex. 2:06
Bro this song is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is actually an instant classic, on the same level if not higher than the classics
Kiero música de grupos lanvin
At the end of the movie video, did he go kill them?
Can't we all just get along??? 😭 I legit screamed "Noooo" when he hit Bonnie.
what is ts
montys dreams be like:
CERTIFIED BANGER!
Gregory "i need yo find a way to get rid of chica, roxy, and mon-" Monty: "already got it covered"
Lyrics:  You're so much nicer than you gotta be A star and part of Freddy's symphony Praise for your ability Charm and creativity (Okay) They always liked you so much more than me I think they'd want me, if I got a shot To show I'm more than just a pair of claws Prove that I deserve applause Practice 'til I'm good because I think the band could have an open spot  You gotta step on up 'til the spotlight finds your face Step on up 'til you have found your callin' up on center stage You got style, you got ambition, so do whatever it takes Step on in (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), step on up (Okay!)  I think I'm finally gettin' ovеr you So can I get another W? I get what I'm ovеrdue Pay me in exposure, too As long as nobody discovers you See, you can hide, but you can't hide from me I'll never say no to my destiny You bring out the best of me I'll say, "Open sesame" To all the obstacles ahead of me  You gotta step on up 'til the spotlight finds your face Step on up 'til you have found your callin' up on center stage Oh, Bonnie boy, you're such a gas, but it's my turn to play Step on in, (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), step on up (Okay!)  Out in the limelight Everyone sees you I think that I might just wanna be you Hearin' them love me just like I see them love you If I control my destiny, I know what I must do, oh  Step on up 'til you've finally found your place Step on up 'til every boy and girl is chantin' out your name Dear Freddy, it ain't personal, but you are in the way Step on in (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), and him, and him, and him, and him Step on in (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), step on up (Okay!)
NO ESTA DISPONIBLE??!?
This is so peak its been stuck in my head 😭😭
Amazing🐊
Holy peak
Not Monty break dancing at 2:07 and just traumatizing the poor wet floor bots
absolute cinema
McGwire fits Monty so well! Animation is also immacule❤️❤️❤️
Banger
Up: Freak you breh  But to be fr, I've listened to this song a BUNCH and I'm still listening to it because of how catchy, jumpy, and joyfull it is even though the lyrics are cold af. But what I've noticed when Monty disabled Bonnie and stole his guitar, he just thinks about the fame and recognition he's GOING to get, but then Freddy, Chica, and Roxane overshadow him seeing as they're in his way of the exposure he wants. So imagining that after taking Bonnie's guitar, he goes to disable the rest of the band, including Freddy, taking one accesory from each band member which makes him look like the main Monty we love/hate in security breach. But after taking what he wanted, claiming his "fame" and "recognition", everything was just in his thoughts, day dreaming everything. So he leaves his room to go achieve his Destiny. So he planned out everything in his mind. Alr ty and goodnight.
step on down
Love the beat! This is one of my favorites.
where did you find out about McGwire (thats if you have heard of him before) i know him from rustage
okay but, the detail in that one scene where theres multiple monty's doing different things is phenomenal, one does the tenna dance, one does the macarena, ones beheading a staff bot, ones destroying a wet floor bot, and clean-o-vac is there too!
Ho wath in 2030 ?
...OKAY WELL THE ANIMATION IS REAAALLY COOKED
I'm so glad people still think SB is relevant
Reminds me of the Pixar movie Coco when the man who thought was the greatest musician was was a murderer that stole the real musician’s guitar and his songs
I dont think enough people are talking about how good 0:58 hits (like...literally) Its so well done
i need this on spotify playlist RN
1:32 skinny king k rool
I LOVED this song it’s actually so good I lvoe Monty’s voice
Eu achando que ele queria um autógrafo...
peak
1:02 mimic 1 2:06 mimic 2
am i the only one who realized it couldnt have been monty that killed bonnie because security breach literally leaves clues that monty didnt have his claw upgrades yet when bonnie went missing 😭it makes no sense for them to add that detail in if they meant for it to be monty... like monty couldn't have clawed bonnie open
1:02 the mimic on the top left!
Idk know that monty could do this to bonnie....
Cool
Wat you mean by that
omg.....   I LOVE THIS SONG!  Idk how but it gives me already nostalgic vibes xD
ahh
He always comes back
This is actually amazing and I love glamrock bonnie being here
ATE
The song and the animation is awesome im so glad monty got his own song
Gonna be totally honest, I didn't like the song too much. It has something different compared to the others, maybe because the lyrics. If we haven't got a FNAF World song, it's probably because this song gives me an idea of how it could have been.
Best song👾
Poor Bonnie
My ordinary life is always a banger
AS ALWAYS, IT'S GORGEOUS
الأغنية طرب لخمس سنوات قدام
He always sing back 😅🎉🎤
its cool that gators are ambush prediters and monty killed them all by sneaking up on them
Interesting detail, in the opening shot, the poster is signed by bonnie, but after his fantasies subside we see it in the background without a signature.
Awesome animation and song
i really love this, one of the best of them!
monty turned into serial killer in his mind
z
It’s lowkey kinda scary how these new robots are so sentient and technologically advanced that they can daydream.
Monty....chill..
Does Anyone else want songs for the other animatronics in security breach now?
We need a roxy song all about her
The song fits monty so well, i love him
the animation oh WOW!!
This would have been a way more interesting storyline that the mimic
cancion que saca , cancion que la escucho 24/7 ,dejen de hacer buena musica porfavor es demasiadooooo
this genuinely feels like old tlt music
Peakk
Monty isn't killing Bonnie; Bonnie is giving her guitar to Monty of her own free will.
2:07 IM CRYING IN THE BOTTOM LEFT HES DOING ONE OF THE FUCKING ROBLOX DANCES 💔
Honestly, the funnest fnaf song ive heard in a hot minute
Why is nobody talking about how this is our first TLT song in like,YEARS?!
2:06 love the reference to the giga Monty glitch 🐊
To bad it was all just his imagination
W song>>>>>
I can here the animation memes coming
2:08 Is he making tiktoks in front of the green screen 😭 Wouldn't most of him just disappear haha, so many fun details in this video!
This is so bloody good PERIODT.
Animation and song is fire 🔥
Montyverse be like. Giga monty in his full glory
The animation... I love it.
I KNEW THIS WAS I NEW SONG CUZ IVE NEVER HEARD IT BUT ITS FIREE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This song remember me of Ernesto de la cruz from the Pixar movie Coco
living tombstone trying to not make a banger song challenge
AMAZING AS ALWAYS
Monty is actually a straight up maniac lol
LA ANIMACIÓN ES DEMASIADO BUENA
ESPECTACULAR
Yall still got it
It's always  step on in, step on him and step on up...  But it's never Step on me😔
why is the fnaf community just cracked
thank you to the living tombstone. you were the childhood for so many of us fnaf fans. i was a fan kid since the trailer for the first game when i was only 7, just a kid who loved horror games. seeing creators like ihascupquake and creators i shouldnt have watched for my age like markiplier play these games, it occupied my time. and your music was so influential in deepening the love for the community, keeping it in our heads all the time. i’m so happy the first fnaf movie ended with the five nights at freddys song, it was the best experience on opening night to sing with other fans. if i dont hear your music at halloween horror nights when i go this year, it wont be the same. so thank you, for helping make the community what it was, is, and will continue to be for the new comer children to fnaf (but they really shouldnt be watching it or playing it lol).
that one monty is doing the join us for a bite tiktok lmaoo
1:15 Hamilton
This definitely sounds like a living tombstone song
"Freddy, it ain't personal." *gives Freddy the most brutal, drawn-out death*
Do not lose to envy
THIS IS FRICKIN AMAZING
Pobre monty
Monty is so cute at the beginning but then it gets murdery
If monty was actually lore accurate.
Peak
WHY DOES NOBODU GET THE ASTRAL SPIFF/SPEEDRUN INFINITE MONTY GLITCH + CHALLENGE OMFG
New song = new hit
It hasn't been long since it was released and I'm already listening to it for like 27 minutes.
This is AMAZING but PLEASE make a mimic song already
this animation is incredible
I guess if steel wool wont give Monty any love we can rely on the fans
Giga monty reference
Just wanted to get register here that i was here the exact day the song was released ( i was 4 hours late because of my shift). So for my future self: Girl start making things happen in your life, im tired of regretting not doing things (stills a die hard fnaf fan since the day you discovered in 2014) and enjoy life as much as you can, i is really short so do what you wanna do, love your family and friends as youll never see them again and stop trying to control life ( your anxious asf) you cant control anything in life, not even your own mind.
The Livingstone nunca decepciona nas músicas de fnaf 🐊🐊🐊🔪🐰
0:07 foreshadowing
I literally can't stop listening to this it's such a bop
seeing the living tombstone in concert next month!
2:35
TLT’s obsession with the FNaF franchise will never get old.
PEAK.
WHY WAS MONTY DOING THE TENNA DANCE AND ALSO FILMING A TICKTOCK
As much as I love the song I always hate how people make Monty an actual evil guy, I genuinely believe that he tries to be a cool guy but he has anger issues that pushes it back. I just hate the “mammal and bird good, reptile bad” trope
NOT LIVING TOMB STONE BEING ONE OF THE ONLY GOO PEOPLE WHO STILL RELEASES EXCITING AMAZING BANGER MUSIC!!!!! ❤️
Human verification.. and I feel like this is fake
2:07 Monty on the green screen doing the burger king "cant wait to meet you" dance. Im dying 😭😭😭😭
This is fire😊
this is funny AND good
OMG IS THIS FUCKING REAL?
Not the monty glitch being referenced in the animation 💀
Dayum this is so fire🔥🔥
The True Meaning of Total Insecurity
The True Meaning of Total Insecurity
This is basically Monty’s villain song
"Step on up"
I LOVE THIS SONG ITS SO GOOD AAAAHHH
Awesome music ❤❤❤❤
TLT never disapoints
SUPA PEAKKKK RAHHHHH
I just relized that why don't they just use a bare endo an put the bonnie shell over it like how vanessa said to freddy that one time
YOOO THIS IS SO PEAKKKK, the song is FIREE, and the animation is AMAZINGG
2:07  yo there’s the robot from secret of the mimic
Now I get how Monty ran over the pizza Plex because he didn’t go in the in the arcade that’s where the DJ is mostly and now I get why the DJ was on the music video because the DJ can’t get out of the arcade so Monty rain supreme versus video but if he throws away, the music man came out out of that one simple area, the other glam rocks, and music man could’ve destroy Monty
Necesito un monty en repeticion de 2:07 durante 10 minutos
1:02 ¿¿¿M2 🧐
I LOVE FNAF HENTAI...
ayuda, llevo escuchando la musica mas de 30 veces, esta buenisima
𝐒𝐇𝐄 𝐂𝐔𝐓 𝐇𝐄𝐑 𝐓𝐎𝐍𝐆𝐄?!
Such a fun idea for a song! Who comes up with these?
Did y'all see Monty doing the tenna
The living tombstone made Fnaf 1 song It's been so long  Die in a fire  I got no time This comes from the inside, And yet jt music made join us for a bite Edit I forgot step on up
No not the mop boys they sab now
The song is a little quiet but other than that I love it.
Fnaf songs are still good even after 10 years🥹🥹✌🏾
Giga Monty song
guys this means that’s it’s canon now
Where can I download Monty model?
0:40 Bonnie and Roxanne like a true GANGSTERS  😁 🤟🐰👉  👈🐺🤘
No bonnie:(
And Glamrock Bonnie: "Might as well face the facts. You were always destined to fail. Time to face the consequences of your failure."  ¯⁠\⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯
2:07 MONTY DOING THE TENNA DANCE DKSJSHSBS
Ugh GOOSEBUMPS on first listen 🥹🥹🥹🥹
Wait he didnt killed them right ? at the end he was still in the outfit he was at the beginning ?  so it was just a kind of dream ??
I think he might have got a little distracted just a thought
deidad
THEY’RE STILL DROPPING INSTANT CLASSICS?!?!
the best music the fnaf security breach omg    yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
a few references ive noticed was at 1:50 was a die in a fire reference, at  2:12 was a lorax reference i think? 2:07 was a reference to when to a glitch where a bunch of montys would spawn
Monty is the vest
1:02 mimic
I really love this song
ts still ass
is that Arnold the crocodile boy
if ther is a monty song we need a boonie song btw like your contant
this song is so funny imo
genuinely love this one so much
1:04 the mimic up left
a brand new song type for fnaf, a masterpiece
makes me hate monty even more
Wow
I made a fanmade video of this in vr
Why didn’t Freddy start boxing he has fist🫩
The Fnaf songs never miss
i'm glad you guys got McGwire, he's SUCH an underrated artist, always seeing him singing with Rustage
Dude this song literally plays 24/7 since it’s release
Tan fuerte esquizofrenia
First 15 seconds and this shit is already peak Living Tombstone
I thought the living tombstone would be dead by now knowing they've been uploading since like 2014 maybe idk
The Bonnie song for a new generation
"To show I'm more than just a pair of claws" Proceeds to murder everyone
At the end of the video we gotta have Markiplier’s “So here’s what I think actually happened:” and he just gives his speech about how Monty was actually the hero
PLEASE MAKE MORE VIDEOS I LOVE YOUR FNAF SONGS I THOUGHT YOU WOULD NEVER POST MORE
Как неожиданно и приятно, очень приятно.
This was so cool!!! I started with the fnaf 1 song. And now this exists. I better Step On Up to the next fnaf banger that is created here
i hate Monty but this song is fire 💥
Love how gruesome the animatronic deaths are.
Very good and original with some classic TLT flavors.
2:07 is this Tenna dance? Near the statue
ITS PEAK!
Absolute banger!
Epic song

e eu achando que a Roxy era carente

Slowly getting obbsesed
I love this part ^-^  0:03. It’s at the start tho but it starts with a beat
20 /10 amazing songgg!!!
fnaf song on the big 2025? hell yeah

W
monty lore
Monty sounded like the gator from all dogs go to heaven, and its perfectly fitting for monty which i always see a southern rocker

"Step on me!" - Monty
Serious die in a fire vibes
This is a different timeline btw
ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL!!!
was that a reference to the infinite monty glitch?
The tune reminds me of epoch.
Wow
step  on him and him and him step on up.  this song shows how jealous monty is of bonnie and shows that he wants to be the star of the show
All that just to die to the goat Gregory 😝
Hey you don't mind if I use the audio do you
This is not backstory, this is Gigamonty backstory.
The lyrics and animations are really good👽👽
Just great
2:07 GIGA MONTIES
1:35 🎉🥳🥳😝
peak
HE DID IT AGAIN?
wow wines old songs The Living Tombstone
this sounds like a hazbin hotel song almost perhaps not lyrically tho
Is this a remix of "Alastor's game"?
i watched the song, just pickles.
I love the younger design of Monty, I think it’s really cute. Along with that, I love the added lore. Monty seemed to look up to Bonnie. But it then turned into to this obsession of wanting to be in the spotlight. Love it
THE GIGA MONTY ARMY GLITCH REFERENCE
Canon in anothet universe:
Now we're waiting for an animation about how Chica breaks everyone down because of food.
1:28 and 1:29 are so good
A NEW LIVING TOMBSTONE SONG RELEASED?!?! AND NOBODY TOLD ME??!?!?
Cory will instantly get flashbacks to Monty’s demise in SB
This is a banger man
teenage mutant ninja turtles
You could've just used not autotune for the voice and get better results ugh lame
Honestly. I COMPLETELY forgot that Monty actually just fricking killed Bonny.  Like its been made into so much of a joke that I kinda just forgot that it wasn't a joke. That's fricking canon.
GIGA MONTY!
Either im hard of hearing or this audio is really quiet at 100%
CG5 and living tombstone should do collab. It will be epic
Whoa-
2:07 mega monty be like
Giggity
Is it illegal for the living tombstone to make a bad song?
this is a mix of kinda what if weird ai came out in 2020’s but a mix of 1970’s fusion
Sun and moon were like what is all that ruckus 2:19
this is epic man
Piola piolin Aqui los que ablan español👇
holy hell this amazing!
"The last album flopped, quick appeal to the children again!!"
Haha Giga monty
I gotta step on up.
Not going to lie I'm a need a song like this but about one of the other characters
2:08 monty in the bottom left dancing like tenna from deltarune
wait why was that so smooth.
YO MORE FNAF MUSIC FROM THE TOMBSTONE LETS GOOOOOOO
This song sounds way too familiar to the hazbin hotel fan song daisies
The mimic has appeared two times in this song I feel like they’re hinting at a secret of the mimic song
Living tombstone this had the potential to be a hit but there's not enough emotion in the voice and the voice makes all the words sound very drone-esk like theyre all one word. When he kills bonnie there shoukd be more emotion in his voice
THANK YOU AND GOODNIGHT
2:08 was that a jw fallen kingdom reference?
I'm so glad you're making vids again 2:34
Monty is fire
El mejor!!!  🎉🎉
This reminds me when it feels to good to be true vibes
Bro whos that on the upper left side 1:03????!?!?!?!!?!?!?!??!?!111/1/1/1/1
2:17 I can't help but notice the classic Freddy's look of the cardboard cutout to his left which I love.  10/10 music video.
Mejor Tarde Que Nunca 💚 FNAF SB FOREVER
The animation is clean
once again like monty in the vid they killed it at another song
0:40 the little interaction between Roxy and Bonnie was so cute 😭
2:07 LOOK IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT, HE’S HITTING THE CABBAGE PATCH🤯🤯🤯🤯
MY GOAT MONTY GETTING HIS OWN SONG IN 2025 🙏🙏✌✌
the living tombstone nunca decepciona!!
He bowling ball killing Bonnie might be a mark reference but I'm not sure
At least Monty didn't touch my boys sun and moon
don’t let cory see this
🤚😐✋
This reminds me of “SMILE” that EXTREMELY GORY Pinkie Pie MLP music video. (Don’t search it up. You just had to be there during that era)
Take a shot everytime he says “me”.
I DIDNT EXPECT A MONTY SONY THIS IS SO PEAK
😊 2:01 me
2:07 I see you, Mimic.
Walking through the halls 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
this is my absolute favorite fan animation ever made for security breach!!!! i already loved this song, but the visuals just add ten times more awesomeness🥺this is so cool!!!!!
Primeeee thelivingtombstone
Love hate Monty 😂
2:04 Godzilla reference
Monty 😎 👍
Monty getting the love he deserves!! My god this animation was STUNNING!! The animators truly created a masterpiece, all the details, the fluid movements, enviroment, the shiny textures, the 2d mixed with 3d that is so much like Spiderverse... wow!!
Average sabrina carpenter music video plot
YES
coryxkenshin would HATE this song
Nah this song is crazy good
Still out here releasing bangers nonchalantly.
2:07 Bros state boarding😭
This is fire 🔥🔥🔥
Am i the only one that noticed that in the scene where there's multiple monties 3 of them are doing dances and its mr antennas dance, macarena, and gangnam style
HOLY MCGWIRE LETS GO
this was a fire
Am I the only one who actually understood the million-Monty glitch at the end?
I just noticed that monty awaits in the recharge chamber because he knows freddy cant fight back if hes tired
Hi🤗
Бро почему оркестр в россии заблокирован?
insane tho
POV Gregory killing the animatronics, except for Freddy and Bonnie
Excellent content as ALWAYS dawg 🌹❤
IM INLOVE WITH THIS!! 💚🐊
бля больше фнафа
los amo, los adoro
Security breach if it was peak
2:06 in the part where there’s a bunch of Monty’s screwing around, there is a mimic behind a green screen.
The animation 😍
Is 2:06 in where you can see all the montys doing things a reference to astral spiffs gigamonty glitch? Cause im sure it has to be
1:02 mimic got his frame
very good indeed, animation, music, how you told the story, everything is impeccable
best fnaf music video ive seen in years, yall nailed it man, i love it, the song is amazing too. its the best fnaf song in a while thats for sure. definetly a breath of fresh air, especially after the SOTM song
Monte be the real villain
5 nights at Freddy's 2 movie confirmed
The animation quality is soo good
Que genial
To be honest I thought they were going to release a new song related to the new fnaf game
FNAF is so grisly.
What would be awesome if we get a song for every animatronic from security breach
i'm glad you guys got McGwire, he's SUCH an underrated artist, always seeing him singing with Rustage
I've listened for the past five days and damn I enjoy this, my September has been full of nice songs I've discovered, thanks for the new addition
IT'S STEVE FROM STRANGER THINGS
I cannot stop listening to this song
i love this song 🔥
Volvieron a traer temazos🗣️🔥🔥
Certified classic. 🎉
Peak
Keep up the good work man 💚🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊
INSTANT peak
instant classic. it's giving og fnaf style music
the song came out 5 days ago and its already my #1 listen
@The Living Tombstone Can you please come to Malta 🇲🇹 and do a concert PLEASE PLEASE!
Even if you kill everyone in the band, Monty, no one will hear the bass player
Oi nomás ese cumbion🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥
You better be paying these animators GOOD
ЕБАТЬ ПИК
1:55 its giving die in a fire
The king of fnaf songs is back!!!!!!
POV: Undertale genocide route.
I love how different this song is compared to the other fnaf songs you made
the goat the Living tombstone never die
The part where the whole band is interacting breaks my heart so much, I know SB was an incomplete project but it just makes me think of what we coulda had.
Wtf were the autistims doing whilst drunking this song??/🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹💀💀❌❌❌❌❌❌
Having McGwire and the Living Tombstone collab was not on my bingo card
oh yeaaaah fnaf again, even I must admit fnaf is dead their songs are still in my heart
OH MY GOD THE TENNA CABAGE DANCE AT 2:07 AT THE BOTTOM LEFT
Omg this could fit Steven universe
Bendy vibes...
this clip is for children, just like the current fnaf
Animators and VFX editors went crazy wit this
Now this sounds like a classic TLT song. Had to check and make sure I didn't somehow go back to the My Little Pony era. I'm all about it.
This is one of the many songs released by TLT that you cannot listen without the MV playing. Kudos to all the people who worked on this!
R.I.P Bonnie😭😭😭😭
now this is canon.
"The animatronic behind the slaughter" Ahh
LETS GOOO❤🎉
this feels so much like the old mlp era, dancing demons/collecting cookies style of TLT and i am SO for it. i miss the old really synthy sporadic and bouncy instrumentals. i know it’s mostly nostalgia and the newer music is objectively more complex but it feels good to dip the toes into older familiar sounds. i loved this so much and you guys should be proud. this is an instant fnaf classic and ill be listening for years to come, that’s for SURE
My favorite part is were Monty Bashed Glamrock bonnies face with the bowling ball
I'm sorry, Steel Wood Studios provided the 3D models?! Holy shit!
Fantastic animation❤🎉
Am I the only person who thinks the backing track is really similar to the one in "My Ordinary Life"
2:07 I'M CRYING AT THIS PART, I'M SEEING MONTY DOING THE THANOS DANCE AND THE YMCA
@TheLivingTombstone You should release the official instrumentals with all your newest songs like with the red and blue songs😎. I love listening to all songs with lyrics and to the instrumentals as well🎉 !!! 🧡💚❤️🩷🩵
legendary
PEAK
Did anybody noticed Monty doing the macarena?😭
O atropelamento de 87
I love your music tombstone
Hell yeah❤❤❤❤
ANOTHER BANGER🔥
Goin in and looking at what all the montys are doing in the big shot of the pizzaplex is so fun, so much detail!!
"They always underestimator A lot of characters but out of that underestimation comes absolute banger's of songs.  Sometimes it's not the serious and edgy that makes impacts it's the goofy and silly that shines through." Sun su probably.
Thank you Mr.Tombstone for another absolute banger
WE LOOOVEE MONTY
Do NOT show this to CoryxKenshin 🙏🙏💔💔
1:03 the moment where Monty drags Bonnie from the left in the corner (not directly in the corner, but a little closer to the center) Mimic XDDD
In 2-3 years after realise song will be legend
i love this !! can’t wait for the concert
Music Very nice!
amazing
Try not to create a banger challenge impossible
Living Tombstone never misses! The animation and beat is so awesome!
1:02 THE MIMICCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC (top left)
Uh oh… my Fnaf phase is kicking in..
Anybody else feels like this totally has "I wanna be like you" dna in it?
Es muy buena ❤❤❤
Is it just me or does the title reminds me of living legend John doe
living tombstone still absolutely crushing it
the animation in the video is beyond praise
ABSOLUTE GIGAMONTY CLASSIC BROOO!
Awesome.
Step on up !
“Tonights the night….and its gonna happen again…” aaaaaugh haircut
this is the best
Aaaaah es demasiado buenooooo, joyitaaaaaaa 💜💜💜
not a bad song I liked it
This isn't the origin story of normal monty, this is giga monty.
ohh cory gonna hate his butt so bad...
Lyrics
I wanna feel Goliath..
My favorite word from this song is “grow”
THIS IS SO PEAK???? WHY WOULD YOUTUBE HIDE THIS FROM ME FOR 4 DAYS IM CRYING... MONTY HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY FAV IN SECURITY BREACH AND THIS JUST MAKES ME LIKE HIM MORE FOR SOME REASON?????? ABUIGSHF
THAT'S OUR AUSTRALIAN CROCODILE ALRIGHT🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺
Idk why I was worried about this song being bad  It’s really good and the  animators did a amazing job
Wow ❤❤❤
Ah yes, My favourite youtuber market plier
I love the many Montys like the bug in SB
GOD DAMN!!THIS IS SO GOOD!!(and,this remember me the Epoch,another music maked by Living
the animatronic behind the slaughter 🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥
I hate Monty.
0:53 reminds me of why I hate monte still love this song it’s catchy
at least he didnt really kill everybody...Right?
No monty doing the can't wait to meet you dance for tiktok😭
Song name?
MONTYYY OHMYGODDD
OMG ANOTHER FNAF SONG BY THE LIVING TOMBSTONE I'M SO HAPPY I LOVE ITTT
1:14 this reminds me eerily of the pre-chorus in high hopes by panic at the disco
Si hay 1 millón de reproducciones son mías, no paro de escuchar tremendo rolon
wasnt it vanny who possessed monty to destroyed bonnie so she could create burntrap with bis body
Gregory solos
2:06 BOTTOM LEFT TENNA you’re welcome
I miss when TLT was more heart filled tunes and not just FNAF money grabs when their bank accounts were running low.
Cute
Day three debunking that TLT will never give you a heart unless you're famous
…
So wait, bonnie dies from getting tapped on the head with a bowling ball, yet monty gets torn in half and gets back up, chica get crushed in a trash compacter and her voice box torn out, and roxy got hit with a go kart and crushed by it as well as her eyes ripped out and still got back up. so why did bonnie stay dead </3
Монти красава уничтожил всех своих конкурентов
GIGAMONTY!!!!!
Why am I just realizing I haven’t been subbed to y’all I  been listening y’all since fnaf 1 song way back when every project y’all do I listened to
his feeling of admiration, even as he's wrecking bonnie and taking his place, is a very unique take on the character, he doesn't hate bonnie, he looks up to him, even to the last moment where he quite literally loots him, but he did it if it meant... stepping up
Is that my second animatronic husband on the thumbnail?  Edit: I wish Monty would step on me.
I saw tennas dance and this is amazingly beautiful it looks like a moive
Seeing Freddy die traumatised me 💀
The Song and Animation are so good man, Great job to everyone involved, but i fr couldn't unhear "Alastor's Game" while listening to this song lmao Would do a nice Mashup tbh, ANYWAYS, HOLY MACARONNI I'M ADDICTED
OH GEEEEEZ MONTY CALM TF DOWN
Poggers!
What theory is this whole music based off of??
This people have managed to carry the fnafs songs for more than 10 years and I think that's really fricking admirable
I haven’t had this much fun listening to a new fnaf song in so long, thank you TLT ❤
cinema
the music is good, but the animation is better
0:49 love this part for no reason
ay monty 🤪
❤️❤️❤️
don’t show coryxkenshin this 😭 (in all seriousness tho, THIS SONG IS A BANGERR!!! gonna put it on loop for the rest of the day now 🥲)
10:50 September 2nd, 2025 is the time I started listening to this..
Gigs Monty! @AstralSpiff
1:03 Isn't that the mimic in the background?
epic ❤❤❤❤
I've listened to this song over 1000 times its to good
One day, that circle will break
YESSSS THIS IS SO GOOD!
Monty is my favorite character and this song is fire
Great song and video. ❤ And extra love to the old Monty design!   So sad that he's actually a bad guy! I used to think Vanny did it and tried to blame him!
Step on up!
congratulations for the music
wow this is peak
2:02 wont he need a band 🤣
this is such an oddity of a living tombstone fnaf song. this is the only one about 1 character, also its fully animated telling a story which is usually not how theyve gone. still a great song and video but just noticed how different it is from the usual which is never a bad thing
This is what WE needed
2:06 the Giga Monty incident....
i’m just imagining that the people are there T posing and watching all this go by like an NPC watching a player commit various war crimes
This is amazing 😍
William afton killing every kid: Monty breaking every Animatronic:
It was very good, what was that...
So sad the animator make way better animation than steel wool studio 😭
The Living Tombstone: Hago puro temazo we 🗣
the wet floor guys just wanted the check
:v
1:43 why didn’t Freddy square up? He dodged but then let himself get cooked
LOVE IT!❤
2:07 look at green screen monty CANT WAIT TO MEAT YOU
This sounds a little like alastors game
2:07 mm hay un misterioso robot arriba a la izquierda, parece withered bonnie
Why does this sound a little like daisys
I love how the song is mostly Monty's imagination. Since in the lore he didn't do anything to Bonnie despite popular belief
WE SHOULD DEFINITELY GET A BONNIE SONG THIS AMAZING TOO (my fav part) 1:15 - 1:35
2:07 el baile de jota xD
I noticed one small issue about the animation Monty has the claw upgrade before killing Bonnie??? 0:47
I love how reminiscent this is of ‘long time friends’
SUPER COOL I LOVE IT
Finally a new living tombstone's FNAF song🎉🎉
🔥 🐊 🔥 HELL YEAH!!
Read the title as step on us
🔥The goat cooked, we ate and left no crumps and we are back for seconds🔥
My game theory senses are tingling
As much as I hate the depiction of Monty being the one that moitled Bonnie, This was fire and I'm so happy to see him getting some recognition and love
God dam monty 1:49
monty really went giga
what a day to be alive when living tombstone release a brand new song🎉
My thought process:  oh wow, a Monty song! oh wow hes going to have a glow up and get in the band! uhm... he doesn't like bonnie? ... oooookkaaayy? maybe he just didnt like bonnie. oh. oh.... Freddys fine though. oh. YEAH GET HIM! oh, it was a dream?  oh
This is what I want canon Monty voice to be
"🐊🎸" the musical
GOOD 🎉🎉🎉
A monty song is something I never knew I needed.
god im so happy
I'M ADDICTED TO THIS SONG, I'VE ALREADY LISTENED TO IT MORE THAN 7 TIMES
2:08 multiple monty reference
I SEE THE TENNA DANCE
I dont really like it😢😢😢😢😢
The animation ♥️♥️♥️♥️
0:00 best part
A banger.. Welcome to the classics budd
Holy shit dude this is insane, such a catchy song and the animators knocked it out of the park!!!
Damn, this animation is really well done!
2:07 is that a Giga Monty I see?
I LOVE ITS
Okay, let Afton out.
Top #1 somg for me rn
1:02 THE MIMIC
Coryxkenshin wouldn't be happy about this...
driving in my car right after a beer 1:39
STEP ON UP🗣️ ‏‪0:22‬‏
In my opinion the ending of the song should been gregory seeing freddy get killed by monty and Gregory kills monty just like does in security breach
Monty is still my favorite boi ❤ He’s just… complicated 😂
A banger 🐊
:( the bunny bullying is so real
He’s my favorite character
This song is fire I can't stop listening to it on loop
Pasando por dónde me crié
Wth. . . I stopped watching fnaf in January and im so lost on whats new. . .
THIS SONG IS FIRE🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
dang Monty look so good in here, aaaaah i can understand completly the feeling of this song,. Gosh was such an masterpiece
This is so peak 🥹🥹
Monty is my FAAVVV out of the SB cast, thank you for adding to what little fuels my addiction 🤣😭😭
Bro idk why but its only been out 4 days and ive watched it like 3 times per day, just bc its on my reccomended tab lol Super catchy
finally a fnaf song that isn't pretenious lol.
Ngl ts actually good
Is it just me or has anyone noticed only foxy got replaced with a wolf and bonnie chica and freddy still in fnaf not replaced
Bowling ball is good weapon
As the number one Montgomery Gator supporter, I can say this song hits SO HARD.
1:00 that was brutal btw love the song
WOW. I'm suprised that i actually start rewatching the living tombstone songs. THIS IS PEAK🔥🔥
GigaMonty got his song!
I dont know why but this voice fits him very much!
Instant Bop. This kills
Monty seriously needs more man, the interactive novel game him some attention. But whatever game comes out next taking place around the time of Security Breach, be it a sequel or prequel. It needs to delve more into both Monty and Chica honestly, those two could use some more time in the sun. Help Wanted 2 gave Chica some more depth, but there was only so much that could be done in a minigame collection.  The song is great as always, the production value is amazing too!
I love how Roxanne did a friendly gesture at bonnie, making it clear that the band just, fell apart in a moral standpoint
Feeling like I'm in 2015, at the height of fnaf songs
Farty farty thank you buddy
Monty killing everyone us such a cool concept
1:04 left side of screen upper corner) is that the mimic or am i actually crazy (still)
TLT kinda: guys, I have a theory Ты легенда бро, делллай
Absolutely Cinema 🙌
How many times have you watched this?  Me: yes
I should ask question. Does this song needs fan animation and remixes? My answer- DEFINITELY NOT! ITS FIRE DAMMIT!
1:02 who is that in the window
Абсолют мухаха
At least 1 million of those views is me... I've been listening to this song on loop for days
Gigamonty moment. 🐊⭐️🎸🏑⛳️
это уже не тот тлт
The lving tiombstone? More like the living legend fr.
This is like the backstory of Monty
This is why I hate monty
The monty clones at 2:07 are legit the dumbest and funniest things ive seen
McGwire bringing fire to the prod like always 🔥
Essa música é muito boa da vontade de escutar 24 horas por dia 😍😍
2:08 monty influenser
2:00 GET OUT ‼️ 🔥
Пон
lowk fire
Ok when he was killing best animation yet tombstone best one yet!!!!!❤❤❤
💚❤️💜
Monty Fans: Guys He didn't mean to kill Bonnie The Virus made him do it. He's only angry of what he's become and doesn't even enjoy being the centre of attention which is why he sneaks off during showtime. Monty Haters: He Killed Bonnie on purpose just so he can have the Spotlight and he'll kill the other band members so no one else will steal his spotlight.
Il love tihs
Вау это чудо ❤🎉
really an audio only version pleeease
if hes acting like this he doesnt deserve to take his place and tbh why didnt he sing that he deserved getting destroyed
Спасибо что включил Россией ты лучший
Nice!
0:40 I love this part, I love they’re group dynamic
Instant classic! I’ve had this on loop since it released, it’s ridiculously catchy.
Lore acouret Monty
Screw the haters. They can't match Monty's level of peakness with this banger. Monty fans rise up🐊!!!
This is Cinematic  Yet so Comedic  "You can Hide,But you cant Hide."  -*Monty*
Reminds me of kinda of the Remix of Savlonic - Epoch u guys did :D
fnaf songs then: give you tips on the lore or give certain view on it fnaf songs now: "i wanna be popular!"
1:16 BEST PART😍
I thought you had already forgotten about fnaf
W
I once thought about writing FNAF's animatronic characters into stories similar to Marvel heroes.
THEY COOKED AGAIN🔥🔥🔥
You can tell at one point Monty actually killed Bonnie because in Ruin you can find Bonnie in the place he died here in this video
AAAA THIS IS A MASTERPIECE😩
The Living Tombstone always makes bangers 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
i love this XD
No sum n moon appearances 😢
why is the music so quiet 💔
Has like, no one noticed the fact it used the beat from "Alastors game" or it being EXTREMELY similar
🐊
It's a MASTERPIECE put this in chinemas💅
The makes me want a Roxane/Cassie song as well 😅
Уже четвертый раз подряд слушаю. Офигаенный клип.
Song isn’t great but the animation is.
Okay, this has got to be one of the best in their recent songs. Ts is a bop.
Monty’s voice is like Alastor.
I just realised Monty was still wearing his long pants when he attacked bonnie and chica and when he was attacking Roxy and Freddy he didn’t have them, he was getting into the part of being a glamrock- but I love the animation and all! Everyone did great! :)  Amazing work!
Woah absolutely feels classic! I hope they make more great, movies and games!
Finnaly a song abt giga monty
GLAMROCK FREDDY X MONTY FOREVERRRRR
Мне одному кажется нотки песни daisies
I lived to see another Living Tombstone fnaf upload. 😭😭😭✌️
2:06 LOVE the giga monty reference!!!
I can already invision the fnaf gacha reaction to this.
i feel so well fed
TYNADO HELPED MAKE THIS MASTERPIECE!
this song is so so fire i love it. the out in the limelight part is SO GOOD 🙏🙏🙏 also gigamonty at the end ...
All i can say after watching ts is: STEP ON HIM ( also what a good song! The living tombstone never loses that spark! Hi from chile! :D
Low-key can’t stop watching this
Still good!
hello living tombstone i like your content but can i say that i guess  if ther is a monty version do a glambonnie song  and have that sean that is all pls reed this comment!!!!!!!!
It so craaazy
I never expected a new tlt fna song but OH IT'S SO FUN AND CATCHY HELLOOO (the animation quality is insanity)
Help I read that as "step on me"😭😭
This gives off living tombstone vibes in a way I can't describe
some parts is giving dont stop me now lol
Always a banger so glad I got to see u guys live 🎉
I saw that tenna dance
Make a fnaf 6 song....
LOVE IT!
MAN PLEASE HELP IVE WATCHED THIS LIKE 11 TIMES IN THE LAST 2 DAYS (I WATCHED IT AGAIN JUST NOW AFTER COMMENTING) THIS IS ACTUALLY INSANELY GOOD
Giga Monty Accident: 2:07
MONTYY I LOVE YOU
i meant to day 1 mashup this song but i got sidetracked...
I love the art style it's like a mix of comic and student sketches
Yo he woke up
Banger  So addictive with this song, rythim and amazing voice of monty And the animation??? Pufff, god tier quality
I never thought I’d see the day that The Living Tombstone would make another FNAF song, but here we are!
I think we’re getting a mimic2 song cus why is he just following Monty like that
banger
Temazo como siempre 😌🫰🏻
I feel like this is what would’ve happened, had Gregory not come. This is amazing- the animation, the vocals, it all feels so real and connected to the game.
You're so much nicer than you gotta be A star and part of Freddy's symphony Praise for your ability Charm and creativity (Okay) They always liked you so much more than me I think they'd want me, if I got a shot To show I'm more than just a pair of claws Prove that I deserve applause Practice 'til I'm good because I think the band could have an open spot  You gotta step on up 'til the spotlight finds your face Step on up 'til you have found your callin' up on center stage You got style, you got ambition, so do whatever it takes Step on in (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), step on up (Okay!)  I think I'm finally gettin' ovеr you So can I get another W? I get what I'm ovеrdue Pay me in exposure, too As long as nobody discovers you See, you can hide, but you can't hide from me I'll never say no to my destiny You bring out the best of me I'll say, "Open sesame" To all the obstacles ahead of me  You gotta step on up 'til the spotlight finds your face Step on up 'til you have found your callin' up on center stage Oh, Bonnie boy, you're such a gas, but it's my turn to play Step on in, (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), step on up (Okay!)  Out in the limelight Everyone sees you I think that I might just wanna be you Hearin' them love me just like I see them love you If I control my destiny, I know what I must do, oh  Step on up 'til you've finally found your place Step on up 'til every boy and girl is chantin' out your name Dear Freddy, it ain't personal, but you are in the way Step on in (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), and him, and him, and him, and him Step on in (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), step on up (Okay!)  Thank you, and goodnight
2:07 tag yourself, im the monty underneath the statue
Current total listening time: 8+ hours multiple hours on loop on Spotify Best sb Monty song I've heard
We are so back
aww he's so funny!
*ROCK N' ROLL!* 🐊
BONNIEEE GET UPPP </3
Feels so much like the old fnaf/batim songs and is so nostalgic bro 🔥
why is this actually good lmao
2:06 that one Monty in the bottom left jus breakdancin
The animimatronics do get a bit quirky at night...
i love the jealous, anger-prone, golfing gator guy; hands down my favorite freddy fivebear character
Oie de levink tustone te akeurdaz de kuam do me tokazte el xilito en el kampamento?😢
this is so epic
Am i the only one hears epoch at the start of the song.
Tlt te acuer das cuanto m tokast el prepu sio en aquel ver ano junto al Mar? 😭
YES MONTY STEP ON ME I MEAN HELL YEAH GOATED SONG OR SOMETHING
Why is this animation better than the actual game
Damn
Im glad Monty is getting the attention he disserves!
не ну это имбааа
BUENISIMO, ASI MISMO ME LO TATUO PA' 😻
Revivió TLT JIJOSDESUSHINGADAMAUSER
this absolutely amazing
I FUCKING love this song ill listen to this if im bored or tired or sad or any mood i am in
This is giving "Cut the cord" vibes
Ok now I can say something after seeing McGwires short.   Uhhh yes…  Also Bonnie’s little pose duo with Roxy was kinda awesome man I miss Bonnie
gives me old splatoon vibes
in the opening shot he hits a golf ball with chicas face on it with a golf club then actually does it to chica
And Sun & Moon just be like 😳😳
AT 1:02 I SEE VANNY SLOW IT DOWN
Now that we got this I fell like we need one for Fnaf Pizzeria Sim cause we never got one
2:07
Dude this is amazing, I’ve watched it multiple times
1:07 - Monty gets his wrist cuffs from bonnie  1:34 - ditches the pants for patterning on legs like Chica   1:40 - Gets star glasses from Roxy  I dunno what he gets from freddy? If anything? Paint on him i guess??
1:03 appears mimic
i love how monty is all dreaming this and then he realizes and crashes out
0:07 i like the foreshadowing in this part with monty hitting the chica golf ball and later in the video we see him actually knock her head out 1:36 Btw PLEASE MAKE A POPPY PLAYTIME SONG PLEEEASE
Why does the song kinda sound like daisy's. The hazbin hotel fan song
1:03 MIMIC
2:07 I love the different dance references omg. I recognize the Gangnam style , Macarena and the Join us for a bite one in fornt of the green screen. Idk the others names
POV bro  Monty : becomes one of the main 4 Gregory : you know, Freddy would love somebody new hands❤ Monty:… half dead
I LOVE MY HUSBAND SO MUCH HE COULD DO NO WRONG   yes he murdered those people but did you ever consider he was just goofing off
I...can't...stop.....listening
ts is so well animated
1,1 goes hardz😊😊
According to the views you normally get when you release fnaf songs I think you will get 10m views in 2 weeks. Mark my words
me when i see the mimic 3 times
It would be so cool if each animatronic had their own music from TLT, like just imagine
this song will go down in history as a masterpiece
Monty deidad🛐
I absolutely love the hillbilly touch in Monty's voice, it really suits his swamp origin.
Game over kid ...  Rock and roll
I hope astralspiff gets to see this
Ts Peak . here before this becomes nostalgic!
This song feels so unique to me. I love the fact that the rhymes feel so different.. but in a good way!
yandere ahh Monty
som novo do lacoste kkkkkkkk
ITS GIGA MONTY
🗣️"STEP ON IN,STEP ON HIM,STEP ON UP"🔥🔥🔥
Genuinely one of my favorites from you guys now.
0:21  "BEWARE OF SUDDENLY  OPENING DOORS" guess Mapbot forgot to read the sign
2:07  Idk why But this looks goffy with the music i love it
everyone did so well on this!! the music, vocals, art, what a treat!! yet another fnaf banger 😊
What Monty wanted: To be the lead  What he got: Breaks in half and later gets electrified to death
we all needed this
Ngl I really wanna know if anyone will make a Glamrock Chica song
Everyone is so expressive!! What an amazing music video❤❤
I can't stop too hear this Diamond 🔥💎
STEP ON UP!!11!1
I love that Monty just multiplies , brings me back when a guy found duplication of Monty glitch lol
I love how at 2:16 he hits the same pose as Bonnie in the poster, bro really wanna be him😭✌️
1:02 holy shit the mimic
Which song is better? This Comes From Inside or Step On Up? Reply to me to choose ur side, TCFI: SOU:
I love the detail that the picture in his room of him and Old Montgomery Gator telling new Monty to "Knock em Dead, Son."
Tombstone you magnificent bastard
Monty please don’t step on me I ain’t into that
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
PUT THIS ON YOUTUBE MUSICCC ALREADDYYYY
Monty is my husband he's so cute when he rages
PLEASE PLAY THIS ON YOUR TOUR!!! SURPRISE SONG!!
bro se sacaron rolasa que voy a escuchar durante los siguientes 3 meses XD
Bro did not have to kill them 😅
This feels like a subtext of Monty venting about how he's the least popular SB character and taking it out on the entire band to spite them and the fandom! Song was a bop and that animation is gorgeous!
Monty is just Gregory now
The living tombstones can make anything a fire song, I bet it would still be a banger if they made a song about a door that talks
How many likes do you need to make a song about the great Bill Cipher from The Living tombstone ?👻
this song is really good
1 M!?!?!?!!!! YESSS?!?!! 🐊🐲🔱 YYAHHH ROCK AND ROOLL HA HA =]
It makes some lore for killing bonnie but killing everyone is wild
Legend is back
This ain't it, great animation but terrible song.
Poitito 😢
It’s just so…. I’m honestly so speechless I love it 11 years of Fnaf song it grew up with me when I saw this video i just felt.happy.
I like the detail that every character's death reasemble at least in SOME way to their deaths in the game  Chica dies because she gets distracted eating food on the kitchen  Roxy dies because she gets hit by a go-kart chair (I think that's what it is)  And freddy gets dissasembled like in one of the endings
Temaso
Absolute Cinema 🐊🙌
The Living Tombstone making a another Amazing Fnaf song
monty i love you
living tombstone dropped a banger
i love this the animation is insane
CINEMA
another absolutely amazing security breach song from my goat
1M VIEWS
This song is actually really really catchy🫩
Is that Montryman? 1:15            (Metroman)
it's giving Golden lowkey
Peak
Omg
2:07 If you look carefully in the background, Monty is standing with a green screen and he's doing the "join us for a bite" dance meme with his hands. Theres so many hidden things in this video😂🐊
You think you can just drop a banger and walk away?!!!
giga monty......
2:17 Monty had a dad?-
Haven't seen a fnaf song since I was a kid, im glad I clicked on this video lol
I LOVE THISS
Dawkoooooooo come over here!!!!!!!!!!!!
GIGA MONTY!
This will bring back the warriors fandom  Trust me
Zero one: okay, your album’s out…can I have my logo back now?  Rust:you’ve had this logo since DAY ONE. You want it back so bad? RIP IT FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS!!
I thought this era was over 😢😢🙏
I’d kill for a deltarune song by tlt honestly
1:18 is perfection.
This is tuff
Does nobody know what this song sounds like?
I'm noticing that after Monty gets Bonnie's guitar and at the end of the song, He keeps striking the same pose Bonnie does on the poster. Either it's coincidence or not, It's very ironic and I love it!
they got the best collaborators for a 2:30min song. DOOOPE!
WOW ONLY WOW IT'S AMAZING
Which one do you think is better is this one or I can't fix you tell me below                                👇
This is AMAZING! Great work as always ❤ So happy to see security breach! Way too many people hate on it…
Эх томбстоун....испортился ты конечно.....я тебя слушал еще со школы и сейчас звучит все очень тухло у тебя.
Best song ever, Monty is one of my favs
ONE MILLION!!!
Como siempre haciendo obras de arte👌👌(Lástima que tengo 14 años porque si no fuese hací iría a sus conciertos)
i LOVE it, its crazy
OH MY GOSH I love the music and the animation is so COOL keep up the good work!
On second watch, the foreshadowing between 0:09 and 1:34 is impeccable
1:04 THE MIMIK
as someone who hasnt kept up with fnaf lore since, like, the fourth one, what is going on in there?? xD really catchy song and just. BEYOND incredible animation!!! bravo!!!
Before you know it Monty's going to hear SAMURAI STAND-UP
Peak
I love it I can't wait to see the concert in October Houston!
OMGGG this is fireeee
wow
Ну тут Absolute Cinema ✋😐🤚
The ending reminds me of this fanon establishment I came up with, Monty Gator's Rocking Swamplex.
This give me princess and frog song vibes

Bro the GIGAMONTYS!!
nice song, very catchy! could use some more bass guitar though, since thats monty’s instrument 🐊🎸
This is good! Great job!
Monty wishes he can do all that. Great music video, this is fire!!
"they always liked you so much more than me" and he's always been my biggest hear-me-out
To anyone who hasn't done it yet, I highly recommend looking at all the silly dances from the Montys at 2:06
animation is fire
i love monty
By the way, We need a behind the scenes look
coool
Tremendo otra vez haciendo un exito 😮🎉🎉
"Die in a fire" sequel. And it's *"fire"* too
THE LIVING TOMBSTONE: I ALWAYS COME BACK
McGwireeee and TLT 😮✨
2:07 The Tenna Dance in Bottom Left is crazy
OH MY GOD IM SO ADDICTED
OMG WHY IS THIS SONG SO GOOD- 😭😭
Omggggg
Una mierda de canción maldita sea es horrible no sirve pa nada es una mierda 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 esto es lo que opino esa cancion
Monty: 😊🤩🕺👍  The others: 💀😟🪦🪏
we got monty lore song before GTA 6  ❤‍🔥🗣🗣🗣
Sad bonie
Thank u so much for the bday present!! This came the day after my birthday
Dude how am I supposed to learn the lyrics with such a beautiful song and animation in the background 😭
MY GOAT STILL HAS IT
Dam
1:02 TOP LEFT CORNER is that the mimic?
I love monty and i love this song
cinema
incredibly fire its unreal
1:44 freddy pulls out ultra instinct for a few seconds
holy crap i come hoem from vacation and TLT dropped fnaf?? hell yeah
Hey
came back to Living Tombstone after a while and saw em green,  i thought they ate so much vegetables just only for the making of this mv but apparently they have taken quite a drastic turn
I have listened to this more than 10 times now
This is the 50th time I've listened to this song and it still hits hard
I can tell this one is gonna be a classic it’s awesome
Don't worry Monty, you are my fav character <3
AAHHHH NEW FNAF SONG. THANK YOUUU, THIS IS AMAZING
The best Security Breach Song and Animation in my opinion
new song added to the play list!
W
Literally my fav song now
tlt never ceases to impress me, as always, melodious, well done!!
Absolutely Cinema ✋😐🤚
This has similar vibe to that aligator from Princess and the Frog, When Im Human song
Reminds me of the prime Fnaf songs made by tombstone
the clankicide is crazy on this one🥀
Chocolate bonnie 👀🔥🔥🔥
Holy damn.. i'm not late am i?
Wow. Absolutely stunning!! I love the idea of making it a daydream so it stays “lore plausible”
Jeez this is so catchy
So damn good dude, please You need to do a bad song one day
HELL YEAHHH A NEW SONG
guessing this is why cory hated monty
This is actually so AWESOME
the animation is like spider verse level
fnafsb genocide route
Peak and I mean peak ok  I'm sorry I'm late to the party though
well monty cant step on up after what gregory did
I kinda like to think this is Murray's revenge on the company that stole his ideas.
🦈🦈🦈
"STEP ON MEE! STEP ON ME BIG DADDY!" is what I am hearing rn
almost a million 👀
2:08 not monty doing the "can't wait to meet you" dance on the green screen
living washed stone
This music is fire as always this  what you can expect from this goated channel bro everyone like and subscribe to the channel so we can get more music
I feel l have to commend the greenscreen Join Us For A Bite dance that completely went under my radar the first 3 watches. 10/10 has to be my fav one alongside the gangnam style monty
When I was there it was only 102 views 😅
I Wish This Last Longer
2:07 Giga Monty?
Обажаю эту песню ❤❤❤
i LOVE it! i love how he went from cheerful, to a jealous murderer, the melody reminds me of Daisies!
Cool!
I cant believe giga monty got his own music video
спасибо, легенда, за детство, твои песни всегда приносят теплые чувства
It kinda looks like Monty’s hitting the Scott pilgrim pose in the thumbnail, and funny enough they both play bass lol
Not the cabbage dancing monty and join us for a bite monty in 2:07 😭
wowowowowowowowow
No one seeing Monty doing the Burger King dances at 2:07 ?
I love this song
love the song
remember when robots moved like humans?
THE TENNA DANCE
No wonder the first part sounded familiar, its because it has the same melody with epoch I think
It's crazy how good both the song and the animation are
It's my special day today 😁
The rhythm of the lyrics i have heard in multiple of your other songs before. Usually takes a second to hear it but i clocked it instantly here. I think you should make one last song to put it to rest in your discography?
Is this character a girl?
bro fr said i always come back
0:51
2:07 I can tell the animators had fun on this scene
OMG FNaF in big 2025, I LOVEE
We decommissioning Bonnie with this one 🔥🔥🔥
He’s getting a promotion 🎉
W fnaf
in the minute 1:03 you will see in the top left of the screen the mimics head
This is one of the catchiest song I've heard it's gonna be stuck in my head for weeks❤😂😂 and it's such a good song aswell
Let the Monty Apocalypse begin!
Wow I like it and its coming from someone who hasn't listen to a nw fnaf song since 2015 (I think) it's been a while.
this song is os peak
This is sick.
So its canon that monty is the one murdered bonnie?
Step on me, Monty
Goat of Fnaf YouTube
The animators must have had an infinite budget because this is soo good
Интересно какой у автора любимый персонаж
The song is pretty good and the video is fire 🔥 nice job once again
I love the music  Thank you living tubstone
Step on it
The animation is godly!!!
nice
FINALLY FNAF SONG
at the end one monty is doing the tenna dance!
amazing
All that and still no Pizzeria Simulator song
Monty doing the Tenna dance at 2:07 in the bottom left
Is this cannon?
DIOOOOS la animación es una locura ❤❤❤❤
Perfec
fye
I cant believe that someones gonna feel nostalgic about this song
It dosent have the same charm as the old ones but hey new Fnaf song :D
I dreamed and this song was there. Classic alredy
This cured my common cold
Wherever there is Poland, it is always the case that there is no Poland in any film
🐊🧑🏻‍🎤
2:07 IT'S! MON! TY! TIME! (Bottom left corner
🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊
This animation quality is MOVIE level... WHOLY!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Ayo
Wow its very nice video bro
I love how this feels like back in the old days, when we got stuff like "Bonnie's song" or "Foxy's song". This is purely a "Monty song" And I love it!
This song reminds me the living tombstones alistors game song they made awhile back
Love how at the first part of the song Monty gives a sentiment "To show more than just a pair of claws" only to end up mostly showing his pair of claws in his fantasies
This video probably had more effort put in than Security Breach
I audibly started screaming “DON’T YOU DARE, STAY AWAY FROM HIM” when Freddy popped up
Animation is honestly amazing. Crazy to me how there’s fan content out there now that’s this high quality
Cool 💚🤍❤️💛💜🧡
guys you always nail every song
So this just proves Monty killed Bonnie and took his spot
Guys he’s aware of the mimic 2:08
how does one achieve the jug band monty model
Dang Gators always murdering Bunnies
The animation is great
I don't know if it's implied or not, but I like to think that all the Monty's dancing at the end is a reference to Giga Monty 😙
if greggy boi did not exist i support this theory
That's not bad
ts is so ass icl
I can't decide if i love the music or the animation more 😭😭😭
QUE BUEN VIDEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! <3 <3 <3
Bloody clanker behavior.
I’d miss when fnaf animation used story, thag makes it fun to watch. But this is gold! It’s breathtaking seeing the living tomb stone to do this. Awesome work!!! 🎉
You didn't have to disrespect my Boy like that!
I love the rhythm, it's very cartoonish and the animation is perfect 😍
the way Bonnie went forgotten...
hey did you notice the mimic behind the green screen (2:06)  (LOOK CLOSELY!)
It's just so peek 🎉❤❤🎉
2:07 gigamonty mentioned?!
GODAMMIT I'VE LISTENED TO THIS SO MANY TIMES TODAY
MONTY INVASION RUN AAAAAAA
what a hell is this..
Cool clip from The Living Tombstone of course Monty won fame only in a different way (bloody way)
nice song,one small issue,SECURITY HAPPANED 5 YEARS AGO.
YOOOOO
"STEP ON IN STEP ON HIM STEP ON UP" i said while they dragged me into the white padded room again
2:07 seeing all the montys everywhere reminds me of the mega monty glitch
😭 bonnie,chica,roxy,freddy 😡monty
2:08 is that clean bot stretching its head or is that wall-e
the vocalist was THE right person, fitting voice and so much soul into the song
DESPUES D VER EL VIDEO 3000 VECES RECIEN M DOY CUENTA DE LOS BAILES Q MONTY HACE XDDD EN 2:06
THIS NEEDS TO BE CANON
i actually have a full on costume of monty
I just realized, the way Monty takes out Freddy, Chica and Roxy is similar to how they are destroyed in Security Breach, Chica gets hit in the head, Roxy is hit by a Go-Kart, and Freddy is ripped apart like in the Vanny and Princess Quest endings
The music is reminiscent of Disney music
2:07 NO ONES GONNA TALK ABOUT THE MIMIC AND CLEAN O VAC!?
0:56 bonnie got humbled in the worse and possible
I like how Roxy was literally looking in a mirror and didn't see Monty holding a racecar behind her
Love all of the references in the mass Monty scene
Create a FNAF 2 song before it's too late for the sequel.😢😢😢😢
A MONTY SONG FINALLY
UNC STILL GOT IT
Yeah, that's my man...
Wait its a fnaf song?
This is an absolute BANGER. Words cannot express how surprised and happy I was to see another FNaF song from you.  12 out of 10, as usual.
Gotta love this Gator!
gator's worst enemies  - shoguns - rabbits  - bears  - monkeys/gorillas
THIS IS ANIMATED SO WELL OH MY GOD!!! I LOVE THE MUSIC AND STORYLINE WITH THE VIDEO!!
Verga , usteded sacan musica cada 10 años v:
Cool recreation of the story from Security Breach's RUIN DLC man!
Bro the squid rot is so funny😂
when the world needed him most, he rose from the tombstone
giga monty will get them all, so stay plinking until then
This is insanely good
Alguien español
duplication glitch reference
Animation fits soo good 🔥🔥🔥 Amazing song
McGwire might be Mr. Nerdcore honestly. He's pretty much on majority of what I listen to now
He is the goat
Bro this is peak
I don’t know if you recall the fact that Vanny can control the animatronics any time but let’s ignore that bonnie and Monty happen to be pretty close in some things as seen before you say that was averting to make people think Bonnie retired there are seems to prove it Monty is jealous of the others however it’s because he is ignored Roxy is the “best” chica rocks on more than Monty and Freddy’s the main attraction the center and then there’s just Monty a back-up guitar player no kid was interested in him besides few if I’m not wrong you can find those few drawings in his room it’s also a theory A theory keep in mind that Monty trashing his room was him trying to fight the virus from controlling him again even if Monty did despise Bonnie there is a lot of proof to show that he didn’t kill Bonnie in ruin like the fact that the green colored claws aren’t black claws like Monty but are more similar to some of the nightmare bots and the bowling ball actually could’ve been anyone even if it was referencing a character the electric sign that had Bonnie’s face probably is a misleading to some people and with the whole “Monty angry kill Bonnie get role get electrocuted” thing summing up the belief just saying that Monty us a little underrated by the people only watching from Greg’s pov and the arcade machine  Btw Monty is actually built different in strength comparable to some stronger animatronics he broke in half landing on his gap between his outer layer a little up or down he may have tanked it and he definitely could’ve lifted that bucket without a problem we all know that his physical stats are all 99 his mental stats like you know anti vanny control 20 at best assuming that the theory is true any argument I could probably fill in the gaps for
THE MONTY ARMY REFERENCE OMG
God song
gader :) 🐊
2:00 is it just me or does the theme sound like the FNAF 2 song? 🤔
🔥🔥🔥
I love this Monty song so much and the jazzy-upbeat vibe is just amazing!! 🤩
Que locura la calidad de animación
I’m so happy we got another FNAF song this is such a surprise to me! 😆
W
Funky song
K! (You can hear it in the background twice)
monty going mad insane is NOT what i expected to see tonight anywyas good song
So we going to get a song for each of the Glamrocks? That’s gonna be a wild playlist addition
Fuck, this is bad Monty and needs to kill the dead🐊❌
TLT never misses
THIS SONG IS SO GOOD?!?!?! the visuals as well ❤
i would have been kinda cool when if he finished freddy with a stomp. correct me if i am wrong
This is going to spawn so many edits ong
PEAK PEAK PEAAAAK
i like this ty for more fnaf music :)
bonie no
I consider this song to be the opposite of You got a Friend in me
Omg two seconds in im already like :D OMG YAYAYAYAYAY THIS IS SO GOOD
The music video is seriously awesome. Animated beautifully!
El volumen nunca es suficiente cuando suena este temazo 🔥
2:06 Monty doing the burgerking dance at the greenscreen
Can’t stop listening to this 🗣️
This song had me thinking it was gonna be about ruin at first instead of a song dedicated to Monty, but boy was I wrong cuz this SLAPS!! Also the scene with Monty dismantling Freddy reminds me of the the scene from the Die In A Fire music video with William dismantling the FNaF 1 animatronics which was a neat little homage to that; nonetheless I’m so honored to see another FNaF sing being produced by TLT themselves!!
Idk what's scarier, the fact he took out all his "idols" with pretty much no remorse or the fact this is scarily close to how the ruined animatronics end up 😭🥀
I can't stop watching it ITS SO GOOD?!?
What’s y’all’s favorite fnaf character or if that’s too hard then what’s your favorite fnaf game
2:07 I love Monty filming a TikTok 😂 And might just be me but what does a “w” mean?
Does anybody also feels like the volume of the song is oddly low? I thought it was a device problem but I tried with another ones and I still hear it unusually low, anyway, great song!
1:59 he wrote “eye can’t see lol” over they roxy poster 😭😭😭
Every time the living tombstone posts im happy
this is like a really good Disney villian’s theme song.
I'm obsessed with this song and music video ❤
2:07 IM SOBBING, IN THE LEFT BACK YOU CAN SEE A MONTY IN FRONT OF A GREEN SCREEN MAKING A TIKTOK DOING THE BURGER KING GUYS JOIN US FOR A BITE DANCE 😭😭💀💀
🌟
PEAK
If I was Gregory I'd be pissed off
A MONTY SONG? I LOVE IT IMMEDIATELY!!!!!
FNAF music is back babyy.
1:59 "Eye cant see LOL" is vile 😭😭
“How many times have you watched this?”       ~ “20712 times”
GİGA MONTY
A banger
I love this song I've preformed it in great many times
Very good. I loved that electronic jazz that characterizes you so much. Or maybe it's more funky. Overall, very good. It also has its pop and blues side.
I thought the security breach DLC hinted that the prototype evil-freddy is the one that killed Bons
i cant beleive they turned that glitch into a song
Vibes of When I'm human, mostly cuz it's a gator wanting to follow is dream
I don't even care about fnaf, but the fan songs are always SO good. I'm so easily pleased. The Living Tomb is really cool.
1:34 Right here to Freddy’s part is my favorite part of the song especially with the repeating catchy lyrics
Crazy how every TLT fnaf song that come out is an IMMEDIATE classic. Well I mean this comes from inside didn’t really stick with people but this definitely will
I really loved the referencing in the part where he straight up destroys Freddy.  (1:54)
Coryxkenshin is getting triggered
I really love this song and it’s inspired me to hyper fixate on an explanation of Monty.   So this is mostly my headcanon for him as there really isn’t a lot of Monty in the games personality wise that is. I think from the scant bits of his character we see and YouTubers making what I think are good observations about him.   1) Monty is actually a cool guy, at least that’s what the other animatronics believe. They all give him his space and alone time because they think that’s what the big cool guy wants. To be a cool loner, it couldn’t be farther from the truth. Which leads to  2) Monty has I think has intrusive thoughts and fantasies. He personally doesn’t believe in his own “coolness”. He doesn’t believe  because it’s all artificial, his backstory, his look, his everything is something made up by the Fazbear Entertainment.   3) In either feeling that everything about him is artificial or knowing that everything about him is artificial this has led Monty to crash out, to have severe anger issues because nothing about him is real. The only real gratification and satisfaction he’s experienced in his life is getting rid of Bonnie (potentially, I could also believe Bonnie did a number of other things to be removed.) because in getting rid of Bonnie he got an actual real reward, he was put into the band, given new hands, given a chance to have reassurance from being in the Limelight and hearing his name cheered on.   4) But Monty has an aggressive behavior born from these intrusive thoughts, these feelings of not measuring up boiled up inside him and explode as he does what none of the other cast members really do. He avoids performing because he’s depressed from negative self talk that pushes him to hide in the shadows of the catwalk and skulk around his own part of the Palace instead of meeting and greeting fans. He’s violent and lashes out because he’s angry that seemingly the others are more loved because he refuses to recognize his own value.   So yeah TLDR; Monty is an angry person with imposter syndrome who manifests his rage by acting like an actual alligator. And he’s green with envy despite his bandmates liking him and thinking he’s neat (but they’ve never really said it because of the viscous cycle of “Monty doesn’t show up to play, his band mates don’t go to talk with him, and so on.”
2016 vibes fr
Absolute cinema
MONTY CONENT IN 2025!? WE'VE BEEN BLESSED! 🐊🐊🐊
He will always remain my favorite no how much I hated him, he is honestly the most human 😡😂🙌🔥🔥🔥❤️💚💜🖤🤘😘🐊🔥🔥🔥🤺
Hey does anyone else see a shadow Bonnie looking thing in the window at the top left of 2:07 ? It’s kinda just looking around and I only see its head , eyes and ears kinda … maybe it’s just me though
You're so much nicer than you gotta be  A star and part of Freddy's symphony  Praise for your ability  Charm and creativity (Okay)  They always liked you so much more than me  I think they'd want me, if I got a shot  To show I'm more than just a pair of claws  Prove that I deserve applause  Practice 'til I'm good because  I think the band could have an open spot   [Chorus]  You gotta step on up 'til the spotlight finds your face  Step on up 'til you have found your callin' up on center stage  You got style, you got ambition, so do whatever it takes  Step on in (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), step on up (Okay!)   [Verse 2]  I think I'm finally gettin' ovеr you  So can I get another W?  I get what I'm ovеrdue  Pay me in exposure, too  As long as nobody discovers you  See, you can hide, but you can't hide from me  I'll never say no to my destiny  You bring out the best of me  I'll say, "Open sesame"  To all the obstacles ahead of me  [Chorus]  You gotta step on up 'til the spotlight finds your face  Step on up 'til you have found your callin' up on center stage  Oh, Bonnie boy, you're such a gas, but it's my turn to play  Step on in, (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), step on up (Okay!)   [Bridge]  Out in the limelight  Everyone sees you  I think that I might just wanna be you  Hearin' them love me just like I see them love you  If I control my destiny, I know what I must do, oh   [Chorus]  Step on up 'til you've finally found your place  Step on up 'til every boy and girl is chantin' out your name  Dear Freddy, it ain't personal, but you are in the way  Step on in (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), and him, and him, and him, and him  Step on in (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), step on up (Okay!)   [Outro]  Thank you, and goodnight
GIGA MONTY ARMY AT THE END!!!
Pasarán los años y TLT le hará canción a cualquier juego de FNAF que no sea Pizzeria Simulator.
These Bonnie's can't catch a break😭
Love this song ❤❤❤❤
THIS SONG IS AMAZING ❤ LOVE THE LIVING TOMBSTONE ❤
That Synth at 0:39 / 0:48 sounds really Omnichord inspired, that's a nice little touch
2:07 Montytosis
I'm really quite surprised we get to see you another night TLT!
Another god song god job
Midnight with the stars and you😌
THIS IS AMAZING
Im so sorry i doubted yall, this is extremely interesting and fun. I genuinely love this so much and making Monty more of a Character here is so lovely.
I LOVE SO MUCH WHEN THEY STOP THE ENTIRE BACKGROUND INSTRUMENTS FOR THE PAUSE BEFORE THE STEP ON UP
SHOW! 💚🎉🎊🎆
OKAY!
I wish the game was somewhat similar in quality to the living tombstone song of it. The game made the theme completely different but did everything to try to make it seem like it was like the other fnaf games and resulted in a poor clash of theming that didn't go well together.  This song took the ideas from the new game and had the guts to commit to it. So yeah, this isn't like the other fnaf songs but it at least let itself become its own thing which is far more enjoyable than the actual game who tried to be both
Giga Monty Lore?
team monty forever 🐊🐊🐊🐊
I love the animation team that did this, kinda makes me think how I would like security breach to like and I love the song its catchy actually good job!
NEW TLT SONG AND IT'S ABOUT MONTY?!? 😍😍😍😍
That sound effect when he kicks opens the door and kills Bonnie just tickles my brain in the right way
Be real 1:44 if Freddy and Monty fight who would win?
MANO Q MÚSICA PERFEITA
Top ten Living Tombstone songs fr
This animation is incredible :0  🦬
Low-key this feels like a classic tlt song
I loved it until I realized this is just gonna make people think Monty killed bonnie
i feel this could be a bit louder?
Finally Monty gets something
I really feel the need to address how absolutely impressive this video is! The animation quality is beyond anything i've seen before!! Every small detail is literally next to perfection it is insane!! Really impressive job from the team! Can't wait to see more from blindspot!
peak
Absolute peak.
Песня просто огонь 🔥  Спасибо что запретили её слушать в моей стране
1:55 is hilarious
Freddy did not deserve that
it wouldve been amazing if you couldve gotten the actual voice actor of monty to sing this
This would happen if greagory didn't came to the Pizzaplex.
1:59 the 🥀 on the glam rock Chica poster LAMO
Giga Monty's canon backstory
1:03 alguien más vio a mimic en esta parte
Is that the Bubba Graham?!
Hey living tombstone could u do a concert in portugal
The Living Tombstone always makes great songs. I loved it.
Somewhat reminds me of "Die in a Fire"
"I love this song" bro really crashed out
This Sounds so Good for the next Time Video Reaction 😮 must put you on my Video Reaction Artist Nerdcore Collection 🎙️👀🤫🎧🔥 A Missing Peace on my Second Channel
i'm glad you guys got McGwire, he's SUCH an underrated artist, always seeing him singing with Rustage
From a professional Monty hater, this is dope!
The animation is crazy good lol
Los amooooo gracias por el video ❤❤❤
What the hell
🐊🐊
You guys absolutely outdid yourselves, this one really feels like an older Fnaf song.
To be honest I thought they were done with fnaf
My only critique is that the song is too quiet! I want to be able to blast this song, but max volume on anything is still only so much
What?!?? Monty getting love and it's from *the* iconic Fnaf fan media guy.
Monty 🔥🔥🔥🙌
"eye cant see" LOL 💔 💔 1:59
I love the song and all but that's not how bonnie died as I believe. In @TwistedAnimaronic's "Bonnie's death was a lie!" video he explains but that's what I believe y'all believe what you guys think is canon I won't judge.😊 Edit: Hi Cg5 huge fan!
Perfect
I can’t believe the Mimic would make Monty do this😔
Nobody can beat TLT when it comes to fan music.
0:38 OK!
This looks amazing quality wise, just wow.
1:04 Did anyone notice the mimic in the top left?
peak
Espectacular, ahora necesito más de esto
2:07 call me crazy but this might be a reference to that glitch that duplicated monty
Bonnie: aceptalo montgomery, jamas vas a ser parte de la banda  Montgomery: conejo tarado, vas a ser golpeado   (Si, referencia al ytph)
2:06 was one of the Montys doing the join us for a bite trend
The animation was good but the music wasn't that cool like join us for a bite ;/
FNAF security breach NEVER DIES
Está muy bajo el volumen de esa epica canción 😢
Genuinely so fire
“See you can hide but you can’t hide from me” This is the best lyric, 11/10 song man
One of the best songs i have ever heard
It's so crazy that they're all so loving, Bonnie inspiring Monty and signing a poster for him, the band not questioning their missing member and allowing him onstage with them, still encouraging him while playing, and then he just breaks all of them... He even tricks Roxy with making her try on his glasses so she's distracted. I wish there was more lore behind this video. Or maybe he just has a murderous instinct and anger issues, who knows?
FNAF 2 end credits song
oh my god we got a new fnaf song
STEP ON UP🔥
ok
😍 wow Monty❤
This MV is just about Monty committing crimes and admitting it
Even though he destroys everything in the music video I somehow fund it adorable
Songs nice but I feel terrible every time I see that Bonnie was decommissioned 😢😢😢😢 my baby 😢😭 but either way I'm glad to see how far y'all came since I was just a child 😂
I love it good song tlt can you make more fnaf songs
Wow, it's so weird how eleven years of building respect for a group like TLT can go right out the window from literally just one video... yikes. The song on its own isn't bad, but you guys don't have a clue what Monty is actually like and now you're spreading this garbage to everyone.
Ok ruin song, but fnaf 6 song??????????
I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS SONGGGGGGG  Its so catchy and fast, and bouncy!! And its quite short, so its endlessly replayable without feeling like a drag  This will be looped constantly on my spotify
this song is both a catchy song but hearing "step on up till the spotlight finds your face" while bonnie gets brutally slammed in the back of the head with a bowling ball makes this both catchy and dark as fuck 😭
This song is simply amazing! One of the best I've heard in 2025
2:07 This reminds me of that one Monty army glitch
That cool🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
2:05 any one noticed Monty hitting the (ant) tenna dance
Absolute cinema
another W from the inventor of music. When does it end?
W good song
Something tells me Cory is not going to like this
The sec I heard the song I immediately sub to the channel
Both the song and the video are FIRE 🔥🔥🔥
Leaving this comment here so when someone likes I can come back here 10 years later.
Cory was right💀
Monty took Bonnie's guitar, Chica's style, Roxy's glasses, and Freddy's spotlight.
I don't know why, but I really like TLT's over the top upbeat music. It's addicting
This song is so 2017, I love this song
This is one off the good ones
The Living Tombstone should do a remix of Basics Behavior
From what I understand.. there was no Gregory, we played as Monty Gator in one of his skyzophrenic episodes
This is genuinely their most creative song yet! And the memes in the shorts section are hilarious!
1:51 just got die in a fire nostalgia from this part
Yo wait why is the animation actually so peak?? The song is also so silly lmao I love it! ✨
This MF the living tomb stone always be cooking
this is truly a good reminder that tlt is the best fnaf music producter
See yall in a few years when this is nostalgic
fnaf6 waiting for its song:💀
AHGGG ME SIENTO DEMASIADO FIVENIGHTFREDYTASTICO°
Noooooooooooooo roxiiiiiiii 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Epic song. I hope you gys play it at the Toronto concert although probably not because you have a set of songs 👀 (hint hint, nudge nudge.)
The animation is really good but it comes from inside still better tho
Peak, that's what this song is! The music, animation, details, it's all just so amazing! ❤ (i feel bad for the wet floor bots that had to witness bonnies death 😢)
2:07 the green screen monty was doing the burger king join us for a bite meme
Can we please get a song for each of the other glamrocks?
It kills me how much Bonnie and Roxy seem to get along when they come backstage, then BASH ;-;
What an absolute banger living tombstone keeps bringing out bangers for more than a decade straight keep it up!
absolute cinema
Damnnnn... Best as always
I swear the start sounds so similar to a different song. besides that absolute banger, cannot wait for more masterpieces! me likey
Good thing Gregory got him back
WE ARE SO BACK
Bad ending
This will be a classic watch
My favorite song
i love you still making non albums occasionally Tombstones
1:48 wow
Feels like 2016
wow, such a great song!!!
WE WANT THE MIMIC SONG💗💗
I’m so glad you guys are still making fnaf songs ❤
The wet floor bots saw it all….
The living tombstone always has the best FNAF songs👍👍👍👍👍👍
perfection
Mimic sale en una skins donde golpea a bonny
Well, the first bad FNAF song from tlt..
🐊Monty🐊 era
we're making it out of the pizzaplex with this one 🔥🔥🔥🗣🗣
Big track
We're so BACK!!!  TLT is back with FNAF!!!
como siempre una gran cancion por parte de The Living Tombstone!!
Multi-million dollar animated movies made by billion dollar companies: Old and Busted Random FNAF music videos: New Hotness  Seriously though the quality of this is fucking insane
Hats off to the animators!!! This was a full on dream!! (pun intended😂) kinda felt like a short episode of an official animated show! Incredible work!
I need the instrumental so bad omg 😳
0:30 its kinda sad seeing Money abandon who he was to be "better"
Idk what to say, man. It's just amazing. The animation, vocal, and lyrics are perfect. It is so inspiring and catchy
Me: Wow, Monty changed quite a bit!  Monty: *kills everyone* Me: ...
mto foda ta
i needed this thank hon
Peak
giga monty
this shit is ass, animation is great but the song and everything else is just...ass
Faz música do Secrets of The mimic por favor, talvez fique incrível
“Wow Monty gets his own song!” *Kills everyone* “Why…?”
ohhh i love the animation, its crazy, and the song is soooo adictive
Good 👍💚🤩💚👍Fnaf security breach set it up
how tlt keeps making banger Fnaf songs is a mystery
1:47 Why does the part where gator jumps onto freddy and kills him remind me of Murder drones (The Cyn Vs N episode 8)
Monty daydreaming to kill all of his idols 💀💀💀
A heard this on Spotify on loop like for 4 hours… let’s make it 12 today 😈 (YOU GUYS DEVOURED WITH THIS SONG 😭❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥)
gigamonty
2:00 best part 🤭
Cory's worst nightmare
NOW MAKE A SONG ABOUT CITRA’S NOSEY 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
Why it sound like daisies?
Who telling Corey about watching this?
Обоже!!! Это слишком прекрасно для того чтобы быть правдой
PEAK
“STEP ON IN, STEP ON HIM, STEP ON UUUUP!” clever
The music is very good, the next time you come to Brazil, come to Curitiba pls😃😃😃
1:04 I don't know if it's just me but I think I saw the mimic in the upper left corner
Man this channel gonna be Fire man🔥🔥🔥
Stop Monty is bullying my son
Monty doing the Tenna dance   LOVE IT
This is an absolute banger, this year has a lot of bangers
holy montyverse reference
Bro Monty’s going on a genocide
The animatronics tend to get a little quirky at night....
I think it's funny how there's a reference to the monty's army glitch
Wow this a great animation good job living tombstone 😊
monty with hair is scary
this song is so underrated
Ufff temon
Someone explain the lore to me, I didn't understand anything
666 k view 😨😨😨😨😨
666k views?! Get another thousand yall
this is so dumb LOLLL i love monty content 🥹🥹
OMG Peak!!!!
Is the mimic here, in this song
Can we appreciate how TLT has been making FNAF songs for more than 10 years? without missing a beat!
I thought these guys quit... but no they were just making peak
absolutely FIRE
Why does it sound like the alistor song. To me it does , Still like it tho.
Steelwool should make a security breach thing about monty
The Croc behind the slaughter
BANGERRR
This is very bendy
2:07 monty doing Tenna dance lol
❤❤❤❤
Я аж не могу перестать слушать эту песню от тебя The Living Tombstone ты просто, как  выражает сам Гремлок Фредди " Ты супер Звезда" 😊😊😊👍👍👍  I can't stop listening to this song by The Living Tombstone, and as Freddie the Gremlin himself says, "You're a Super Star."😊😊😊👍👍👍
Does anyone notice that at the start of the video, Monty putts a gold ball with Chica’s face on it. And later in the video, he kills Chica with a golf club to the head.
I love it so much
Just noticed from 1:01 - 1:04 where he's dragging Bonnie, that you can see mimic in the background. At least I think it's him.
Is this Notice Me Senpai all over again?
There’s so much cartoon violence here that’s afforded with the fact they’re all robots. But this is still rated-R 😅😂☠️
2:07 i love the amount of references here
A masterpiece of animation :)
I love how lively and active are bots animated! not only animatronics but also floor bots and the staff bots! like specially this moment 02:02 when Monty goes complete bonkers, and this one! 00:58
This song is amazing
i just say monty do tv dance in bottom left in the when u see the statue
dropping another good song
Did anyone notice that at the end of the song? There's the secret of the mimic hippo at the end.
Now who wants to listen to the mimic song !!??
Monty is impostor!!!
2:21  I just realized Monty has a picture with his dad and it says “knock ‘em dead son” that’s sweet 😭
i like how in the beginning monty hits a CHICA GOLF BALL with a gold club , and he does the same with chica later on
Why didn't you answer my e-mail😢?
2:17 I noticed at the very end, there’s a poster of the MCM Jug Band Monty that says “Knock ‘em dead, son!! -Dad”
🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️STEP ON UP
yall cooked
I Need a real Life monty now.
I love how the song itself and the music video seem to portray the events in two different ways
I love how Monty has green spray paint that won’t come off on his body at the near end of the video because he’s an animatronic.
Beautiful video. Love the little effects that pop around Monty's claws and body. Super cartoony and fun, despite him murdering everyone lol
robot violence
1:40 he’s bonking her with a go kart like a looney tunes character,comedy gold
ITS LIKE 'DIE IN A FIRE' BUT EVEN SPECIAL ❤
YOOOO THIS SONG IS SO GOOOODDDDD, WOOOOOOOO I LOVE THE IDEA OF MONTY BEING A WORKER IN THERE BEFORE KILLING BONNIE BC IT MAKES SENSEEE, AND THE SONG SOUNDS SO AWESOMEE
Lyrics [Verse 1] You're so much nicer than you gotta be  A star and part of Freddy's symphony  Praise for your ability  Charm and creativity (Okay)  They always liked you so much more than me  I think they'd want me, if I got a shot  To show I'm more than just a pair of claws  Prove that I deserve applause  Practice 'til I'm good because  I think the band could have an open spot   [Chorus]  You gotta step on up 'til the spotlight finds your face  Step on up 'til you have found your callin' up on center stage  You got style, you got ambition, so do whatever it takes  Step on in (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), step on up (Okay!)   [Verse 2]  I think I'm finally gettin' ovеr you  So can I get another W?  I get what I'm ovеrdue  Pay me in exposure, too  As long as nobody discovers you  See, you can hide, but you can't hide from me  I'll never say no to my destiny  You bring out the best of me  I'll say, "Open sesame"  To all the obstacles ahead of me  [Chorus]  You gotta step on up 'til the spotlight finds your face  Step on up 'til you have found your callin' up on center stage  Oh, Bonnie boy, you're such a gas, but it's my turn to play  Step on in, (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), step on up (Okay!)   [Bridge]  Out in the limelight  Everyone sees you  I think that I might just wanna be you  Hearin' them love me just like I see them love you  If I control my destiny, I know what I must do, oh   [Chorus]  Step on up 'til you've finally found your place  Step on up 'til every boy and girl is chantin' out your name  Dear Freddy, it ain't personal, but you are in the way  Step on in (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), and him, and him, and him, and him  Step on in (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), step on up .
every song this guy makes is the best fr
Blood thirsty
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Play that funky music Monty!!
this is so slow
step on up!
Jesus Christ loves you
Absolute cinema
This is pure 🔥
Why did they make Bonnie with a small nose and without his eyeliner??🕊️🕊️🕊️ It looks bad😭💔
TS so fire
MY BABY GLAMROCK BONNIE
Absolute cinema I just stunned listening and watching so good
This would’ve made a better Security Breach.
Yes, you indeed got me... This is absolute cinema ✋🤚
omg the funtime foxy cant wait to meet you meme is so fucking funny :sob:
I love this ❤
This song been stuck in my head since it released
Wow
1:48 pov: bro doesnt accept your 27th invite so you just skin him alive just because
Amazingggggggggggggggg
Bro is the next William afton
Where is the FNAF fans??👇👇👇                                                    ❤
GASPP? A NEW SONGGGG
OMG I LOVE THIS!!!❤❤❤
0:57 gives me insane chills every time, it's so quick and brutal
honey wake up the tombstone is living
This song reminded me of the song Daisies. Its almost the same melody
Monty’s glasses must be the wrong magnification, he’s constantly tripping
2:07 los Montys bailando 🤣
WHAT IS THIS MELODY
Monty is the Vengeful Spirit
This the bestttttttttt
Absolute banger of a song!!!!
Is this hurt the broom?
holy makerell
2:06 HELL YEAH GIGA MONTY!!!
Oh...that's togore.... That's togore of my comfort character
I came here because I heard about Monty commiting robot murder.
Doomed yaoi?
Great video
peak.
This feels like a disney villian song!
the song almost sounds like "i can make it better", especially the first bit.
Just : ✋🗿🤚
One of my favorite artist made a song about my favorite character? HELL YEAHHH!! Seriously tho, I love this song!
Banger🌹🔥🔥🔥
why did monty do that? is he stupid?
This one is so good
0:58 sounds like a gunshot to me
1:02 when Monty is dragging Bonnie, did anyone else notice the mimic on the left?
So coool!
I hope this is at the concert
I love how this sounds like a modern Disney song lol
This song gives emotions I can’t explain
YESSSSSS ❤❤❤❤
My only problem with this song is that I can't make it louder, it's a bit quiet compared to other songs
2:07 Is that Tenna's Dnace?
This is so fire oh my god❤
where's the fnaf 6 song???
I love this song
NEW SONg YO ITS A BANGER
I'd prefer my ordinary life
0:31 It's starts like FNaF 1 song. 0:37 And it's like FNaF 2 song.
I don’t expert song from you again 😢😢😢🎉🎉❤❤❤
I loved everything about didn't expect anything else from you guys ❤
We are approaching actual film quality animation for fnaf music videos. Genuinely insane, imagine showing this to someone in 2013.
This isn't right  Markiplier said that Bonnie got hit by a bowling ball after doing some tricks  And Monty saved the day by placing the Floor sign robots making a boost in Pizza-plex safety
I feel like most of TLT's songs have messages that aren't directly related to the media it's based on, like "I Wanna be a Machine" being about burnout, or "This Comes From Inside" being a message to the FNaF community, but I'm struggling to see how this song could be taken as anything but what it is at face value  Not to say at all that I dislike it, I actually love this song!
It's good to see one of your fnaf songs again. I hope you have participation in the credits of the second movie.
0:40 this is my favourite bit❤❤❤
The living tombstone always make the amazing songs

i fucking love you with a passion
I already feel nostalgic for this song 😂
I really liked the animation the quality goes crazy but i need those fnaf songs back in like 2015-2017 those songs went absolute crazy
Okay hear me out
Cory will love this video
New tombstone, yippee!
At least he didn't kill the daycare attendant 👍
that army of monty gave me flash backs of some horrifying glitch from the past
congrats monty, u now been promoted to clanka status
I DIDNT KNOW I NEEDED THIS IN MY LIFE
….dose anyone else hear jackblack in him?
It’s Monty’s world and we’re just living in it
Ahora entiendo a freddy porque extraña a Bonnie ;-;
2:07 Why does nobody notice the mimic hiding behind the green screen where Monty was taking a photo? Am i the only one??   Also, i found Monty doing the macarena, it's silly tbh  Edit: I just realized that Monty infront of the green screen was actually referencing the burger king 'join us for a bite' meme
Sorry, but This gives me slight "Die in A Fire" vibes 💥✨
mid
poor roxy, she got wiped out by yet another go kart 🤣
this is the most garbage ever u made, u can made this better
1:16 is the BEST part
Amo demasiado
bangers 🔥🔥
Monty mentioned but at what cost 🥀
I hate monty.
i think we forget how strong and aggressive monty is and could genuinely commit murder among his "friends" if he wanted too😭😭 anyways this song is super catchyyy edit: I  CANT STOP FKING LISTENING TO THIS ITS SUCH A BANGERRRR
bruh people think my mascot is based off of monty which makes me lose hope in humanity
Lo hisieron otra vez una musica epica de fnaf❤❤❤❤❤
Freddys reaction time is insane
2:06 ah yes, a great reference to mega monty and his army indeed.
the animation is unbelievable
I love this XD
You guys never miss!
this feels like it could be in a fnaf security breach musical
This is so addicting fr, already my fift replay 😭!
Пісня дуже крута я вже десятий раз її слухаю
I listened to the song 20 times. This is the best song I've ever heard.
THE MIMIC 1:03
yes.........
The animators KILLED it with this one! Nice work you guys 🤩
1:57 Crazy...
maquivelism the song
Best characterization I have seen of Glamrock Bonnie, genuinely. 💙🩵❤️ I absolutely love this song and animation!
Well look at this in 10 years wiping tears of nostalgia like the ogs of the old fnaf songs😢😢
😮
LETS GIVE THE ANIMATORS A ROUND OF APPLAUSE🔥🔥🗣🗣
FINALLY A VIDEO THAT WASN'T ANIMATED BY CODA
its been a hot minute since ive heard a new fnaf song im thoroughly pleased
Glad my favourite glamrock gets a song
PLEASE WE NEED MORE GLAMROCK DEDICATED SONGS
Loved it. Can you as well make songs for other ones to freddy,roxy,chica
Temazo temazo 🗿🗿🗿
Cory would be so mad rn.
You're so much nicer than you gotta be A starring part of Freddy's symphony Place for your ability Time for creativity (Okay) They always like to show much more than me I think they want me, if I got a shot To show 'em more than just a pair of claws Knew that I deserve applause Life is feelin' good because I think the band could have an open spot  You gotta step on up 'til the spotlight finds your face Step on up 'til you have found your callin' up on center stage You got style, you got ambition, so do whatever it takes Step on in (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), step on up (Okay!)  I think I'm finally gettin' over you So can I get another W? I get what I'm overdue Pay me in exposure, too As long as nobody discovers you Say you can hide, but you can't hide from me I never say no to my destiny You bring out the best of me I'll say you been testin' me To all the obstacles ahead of me  You gotta step on up 'til the spotlight finds your face Step on up 'til you have found your callin' up on center stage Oh, Bonnie boy, you're such a guy, but it's my turn to play Step on in (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), step on up (Okay!)  Out in the limelight Everyone sees you I think that I might just wanna be you Havin' them love me just like they see and love you If I control my destiny, I know what I must do, oh  Step on up 'til you've finally found your place Step on up 'til every boy and girl is chantin' out your name Dear Freddy, it ain't personal, but you are in the way Step on in (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), on him, and him, and him, and him Step on him (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), step on up (Okay!)  Thank you, and goodnight
"I GOTTA *Bangs the shit outa Bonnie* STEP ON UP!"
So peak
I hope every character gets a song 🤤🤤
It's A Nice Angry Song Ever In The World! 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Bonnie just waving at the wet floor bots then monty beats the shit out of him 😭😭 0:58
So angy
Reminds me of those musical numbers from old disney movies. Just good ol' family-friendly Monty, no violent themes of any kind no siree bob 🥰🥰
🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊
AMO 🫦💋💕💖‼️
I LOVEU MONTY
Very random but very welcome
clanker on clanker violence
We are so back (we never left)
2:07 wait is that GIGA MONTY  SPIFFF YOU NEED TO SEE THIS!!
Thats is cinema 🗣️🔥🔥🔥
PINCHE ROLON TODO HERMOSO
Monty has always been one of my favs in security breach, Ty for this❤️
La animacion esta increibleee
This is killer! This music is such a bop, love the chorus, animation, and everything in-between! New favorite!!!
MONNNNNNNTYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!
2:07 spiff's GIGA Monty found
What's wrong with the Living Tombstone? It seems they're being prevented from making bad songs.
I love the twist of how he was just imagining things and wasn't actually being on stage❤❤
U guys did a really big mistake here. How can you make this only last 2 minutes and 16 seconds, i demand at least the double of it with more verses. My wife is mad on me for repeating, so i need a longer version
Hot take: this is their best song they’ve made ever
La animación es demasiado buena, la canción es adictiva ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️.
Hello everyone Jesus loves you very much and may he bring guidance, peace, and joy to your lives ✝️🙏 💖
estuve aqui
This feels like a actual song monty would sing if they made a fnaf sb musical
MONTGOMERY GATOR I LOVE YOU 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
thats one for the playlist (as a monty fan i thank you)
NO WAY! MCGWIRE?! HE WENT CRAZY ON THIS (AS USUAL), THANKS FOR THIS BANGER TLC!
Don’t let Cory see this
Who is feat?
ELES ESTÃO VIVOOOOOOSSSSSS❤
Giga-Monty mentioned
nefasto       deaaaaa
Finally my boy Monty have a good song, thank you for giving us the best of Monty👑
I love how Monty Gator of all fnaf characters gets his own living tombstone song, and it absolutely slaps!
fnaf song... in 2025? 💗💗 worlds healing
WOWW
I'm always fascinated by the amount of amazing songs and animations that are inspired by Security Breach. It almost makes me think it was actually a good game :P
He just conmitted 6 cold-oiled robocides in one song
New Hit 🗣️🔥🎶
Tombstone just casually dropping yet another FNAF banger and in my opinion one of his best!
I love the little "easter egg" of the mimic being there behind the green screen 2:07
uffffffffff... temazo
Giga Monty!!!!!!
Peak
this is sick
one of your song
I keep replaying the part at 0:58 it's just SO incredibly satisfying with the beats matching up with the brutality of the animation and just how Bonnie crumpels to the ground. It's peak.
The living tombstone the best
adictiva la cancion sin duda joyita  1:15 RE EPICO CHAVAL
1:44 the best part
Recontextualizing the drum moment of "knock on door, kick open cheerfully" into "bowling ball to the skull, corpse shattering glass" is such a cool thing to do musically, even outside of the music video
Make revege remics pls
This song probably is gotta be used in tiktok because it fits some villains of the science fiction and some series and movies in general
It's so goooooooood🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊
BLESSED TODAY OMGGGGGGGGGGG
This is giving me pushes up daisy vibes
another BANGER LETS GOO
Very good for toxic Monty!
❤❤❤ Love Monty
I usually don’t like these, but this is epic
I feel like the animators need to work for Sony animation or glitch. This is good animation and love the song absolutely 💯 peak. the foreshadowing of how Monty takes chica out pretty impressive I didn’t realize when I first watched it good job livingtombstone. 💯💯💯💯
Díganlo bros está muy buena
U have competition ERROR ERROR soul not found
Clanker war
Ok
0:58 this was clean
We need glamrock Bonnie back We took down montgomery gator we have avenge Bonnie now we meet the bony back 🐇🐇🐇🐇 please. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
0:40  love this part!
wow, this just makes me hate Monty more than I had before. Thank you. cool song tho.
Wow 3 meses ;0
Love the lyrics, love the animation and i definitely loved all the lore being taken care of, but i didn't really like the tune :/ . First time that this happens to me with this saga of songs 🤷🏻‍♂
1:57 is the FNAF 2 Mrs. Afton song instrumental
Bro still upload FNAF song💀
IS FNAF BACK?!!
I love Monty and I wholeheartedly believe that he killed Bonnie. But I love him for it because he’s so unapologetically a monster
No esperaba tanta maldad de mi animatronico favorito jajaja
It’s a good song, but I do feel bad how Bonnie died
It’s great but why are your songs only like 2 minutes long nowadays? They don’t last nearly long enough. You need to add a bridge or something before the final chorus. 😢
The discord motif is so cool
This was fantastic! The lyrics perfectly captures Monty’s envious and vicious personality. His journey from a bayou boy side character to the destroyer of Freddy and the gang flow really well throughout the whole song, and in general it’s just really neat to see his character get analyzed like this. Of course, the song itself is a genuine BOP too! I LOVED the instrumentation and melody in this. All together, this was really amazing. Thank you Living Tombstone for this bayou BANGER of a tune.
damn okay
transformers level robot gore
Awesome song and animation!
this is a banger i love listening to it i could listen to it for hours keep up the good work
fun song!
Like if you saw the mf mimic
The living tombstone does it again
TS FRYING ME IS HE SLIMING EVERYBODY😭😭✌️✌️✌️
Murder is good, even if it is robotic murder, This is William approved.
The living tombstone cooked again 🤌
there us nothing cooler than expresive robots fr
Omg this is fire
Still sad that out of the ones that could have been attacked, my favored of the original 4 band members was the one taken out 😔
STEP ON UP 🗣🔥🔥¡¡¡
No sé inglés pero que temaso
0:58 love how that sounded
The best part is when Monty tries to take the bass from Bonnie but he has to pull twice because Bonnie still alive trying to hold his bass 1:06
The end said thank you and good night which is the title of a hazbin hotel song
2:07 you cant hide my goat clean-o-vac from me
We got a song dedicated to Monty before the FNaF World song 💔
…months intrusive thoughts?
love it
I always come back 🗣️🔥🔥
Man I love this stupid gator
Can’t believe you guys made a Andrew song
WAKE THE F*** UP THE LIVING TOMBSTONE IS HERE!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Biblically accurate Monty
Hello future person
Why did you just recreate Alastor's game ?
Had to pause cause I almost cried
Gregory with a ball shooter and cassie in a water surface: 🤷🤷
AMAZING
Joga muito cara
Was that a die in a fire shot with Monty destroying Freddy?
Love the foreshadowing of Monty hitting the gold ball with Chica’s on it and then hitting Chica’s head off
Another fnaf song, and i already loved it, amazing work man
We need a extended version of this 💔
Wow
Waiter! Waiter! More SB songs!
This is totally what happened between Security Breach and Ruin.
I LOVE THIS😭😭😭😭 I NEEDED THIS Y'all did my favourite character justice💯💯💯
We need glamrock Chica music !!!
2:07 i like how clean o vac is there and caution bot is curious
after bonnie, this song becomes about giga monty
I actually dont like the voice but love the song
that is good sound track is peak 100/10
No one show this to Cory. He might actually lose it…
2:07 this reminded me of that Monty stampede giltch
The old Monty is beatiful
AliClanker solos Citra 😮
Coryxkenshin would be so despised lol    But the song is great like every other song❤❤❤
1:59 monty just hit chica with that "🥀"🥀
dammm.... new song stuck in my head 😍😍😍
Will we see "It's be so long" in the big screen?
That spiraled out of control so fast
this is a banger! he banged their heads until they moved no more!
THIS IS SOME MONTY BARS!!!❤
THIS IS SO GOOD! You killed it!!!!!!
Oh monty you silly billy
Definitely a song where I remember the verses than the chorus parts, like I love the hell outta the rhythm
Can you make a song for the other characters like Freddy chica Roxy and Bonnie?
It's Beautiful 💚🎶 Outstanding visuals!
Absolutely love it
Wake up! TLT cooked a new song!
igual q los anteriores 10 años, The Living Tombstone no decepciono, desde los primeros segundos ya me había atrapado por completo xD
I like how each animatronic died like how they died in the games Bonnie by Monty(that just a theory) chica with her beak falling of when something smashed her face Roxy by a go cart and Freddy he gets ripped apart by Monty
I LOVE SO MUCH THE ANIMATION AND THE SONG
this is a love song to every monty fan. my guy was completely left behind by steel wool 😭
I hate how bouncy this is.
no vuelvan a argentina
wacho
YOU COOKED KKRKRKEK3NEJE 🎉🎉🎉
This was so cool
Idk anything about this game, does this happen or not?
Didn't expect a return to this franchise, especially not with Monty of all characters, but I certainly enjoy it.
never stop cooking tlt i love i hope you came to argentina again i wasnt able to see you
I will not stand for this monty slander.
2:07 THE MIMIC IN THE BACK!!!
Ohio man rizz
The pure chaos is what makes this funnier, Fire song
soy el único que cree que fnaf sb es peor que fnaf 3
Totally unrelated I feel— but this lowk gives the vibes of the song daisys!!!! Like it gives the happy tune with dark undertones—it’s just so catchy and bouncy sounding just like it! I love this!
Bro could be retired for 10 years, and suddenly come back with a masterpiece 🌹🌹🌹
Another banger
This is Security Breach's secret 7th ending
The monty with the green screen doing the SL dance 💀 2:07
Bombardino crocodilo
Thank you so much!!! For making a song of my favorite FnaF character!! 💚🐊🐊
PLEASE PLAY THIS ONE LIVE IN CHICAGO!!!
New fnaf song?
so cool
"Man this song's great! And the animation's so cool-" 2:06 "IS HE MAKING A TIKTOK-  *IS THAT THE JOIN US FOR A BITE DANCE???????"*
Wow
When his dad said "knock 'em dead, son. I don't think that's what he meant...
Absolute feast
Omg so good
Nice Work Sir! Honestly, Montgomery deserves so much better, and this is it! Thank you so much!
I love this so much 🔥❤
This will be 2025 kids soundtracks
DAY 176 - 180.Trying to get them to come to Medellín, Colombia
I imagine this will be considered a classic someday
The song is giving daises and I love it
You fell off. Go back to making brony music.
1:03 anyone else saw the mimic in the window?
YEAAAA WE FINALLY GOT A SECURITY BREACH/RUIN SONG AND ITS PEAKKKK
bro these lyrics are absolute fire 🔥🔥🔥
I loved this. I actually cannot properly express how truly phenomenal the animation on this is. Thank you for still producing incredible music videos Living Tombstone! - Love, an old fan
this is the most classic living tombstone beat we could ever get
Those poor wet floor sign bots
How much perfection in this video clip!!!
You're so much nicer than you gotta be A star and part of Freddy's symphony Praise for your ability Charm and creativity (Okay) They always liked you so much more than me I think they'd want me, if I got a shot To show I'm more than just a pair of claws Prove that I deserve applause Practice 'til I'm good because I think the band could have an open spot  You gotta step on up 'til the spotlight finds your face Step on up 'til you have found your callin' up on center stage You got style, you got ambition, so do whatever it takes Step on in (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), step on up (Okay!)  I think I'm finally gettin' ovеr you So can I get another W? I get what I'm ovеrdue Pay me in exposure, too As long as nobody discovers you See, you can hide, but you can't hide from me I'll never say no to my destiny You bring out the best of me I'll say, "Open sesame" To all the obstacles ahead of me  You gotta step on up 'til the spotlight finds your face Step on up 'til you have found your callin' up on center stage Oh, Bonnie boy, you're such a gas, but it's my turn to play Step on in, (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), step on up (Okay!)  Out in the limelight Everyone sees you I think that I might just wanna be you Hearin' them love me just like I see them love you If I control my destiny, I know what I must do, oh  Step on up 'til you've finally found your place Step on up 'til every boy and girl is chantin' out your name Dear Freddy, it ain't personal, but you are in the way Step on in (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), and him, and him, and him, and him Step on in (Hey!), step on him (Hey!), step on up (Okay!)  Thank you, and goodnight
crying rn this is so good
Así es como Monty mata a Bonnie y se convierten en algún tipo de cazador de Glamrocks
Gostei tanto dessa música 🎶
This goes so hard
Yes 😌
Every song y'all make its awesome. Don't stop doing this, please!!
ooh
after so long,it’s happened again
Giga monty is back once again
😅🎉🎉
Neat!
WE GOT A NEW FNAF SONG
we so back 🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
Too bad they didn't show too much about Monty in the games, would of been lore revealing about what happend.   Great song anyways!!!! :D
2:07 Heaven of Easter Eggs
Another fnaf song from The Living Tombstone? I'm very overjoyed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
yes
2:07 love the giga Monty
Perfect depiction of the character
I feel you Monty💔🤧🤧        2:08 one of the Monty is doing tv time dance
🐊🔪🐰
@TheLivingTombstone  ¿Can i make you a cuestion?
2:07 basically my brain Fire song btw
A bit random but what a lovely song!
2:08 not him in the background doing the cant wait to meet u dance LOL
OMGGGGGG I LOVEEEE THIS
Bright ahh song for a dark ah plot
2:07 (idk if this is how you do timestamps) the corner left monty is doing tenna dance(that is just a free animation from a website)
God this animation is beautiful
Fire
Que bonitos ojos tiene
The, Living Tombstone just got another Legendary, FNAF Song!!!
Both the animation and music are insane, I love this. 💙 So glad to see more Security Breach related content.
2:07 NOT THE BK DANCE
my one wish is to play golf with monty the tiger
Why does the beat sound like dasies beat
The Age of Strife colourised:  Naw but all jokes aside, that animation was so smooth and good, well done!
Fav song of the year
another LT song???? Lets go ill give my honest opinion   Edit : I can imagine Monty doing all that. Song mid.
monty is william afton
PEEAAKKK I CANT EVEN DESCRIBE IT IN WORDS
This sounds a lot like Epoch like a lot
Melhor parte  0:53
Absolute Cinema
I’ve seen the process of this long time ago, it’s finally here!
Eu acho bizarro o quão bem trabalhado é tudo isso. Não só a música (que é incrível), mas também o clipe. Meu Deus, vocês realmente pensam em CADA DETALHE. Meus mais sinceros parabéns. Vocês não criam músicas, criam experiências...
Amazing work. ❤🎉
This feels a lit like alastor's game <3
Tuff
OMG this is actually amazing the music video is amazing and you nailed the lyrics! I love that This is actually based on a popular conspiracy theory with Bonnie getting killed by Monty! I love this song sooo much 😭❤
O monty merecia muito mais do que ser lembrado como aquele que quebrou o bonnie, amei a música🐊
Is that the Mimic in the top left at 1:03
Eh, Close enough. welcome back William
This is fire
Step on in step on him hell yeah Monty that’s the way we do it 🤘🤘🤘🤘
1:41 it was at this moment she knew She fucked up
Absolutely cinema
2:12 the Chuck Berry reference!!
Bro the wet floor sign bots were too innocent for this 🖐😔
Hey chicos! Dios regresó 🗣🔥
Yet another amazing banger!! Plus the animation to it is absolutely perfect and very fun to watch! Everybody did a splendid job on this. :)
This is fantastic, perfectly in character, and so well animated
The fnaf songs legally cannot miss there always bangers 😭🙏
agro
I love Monty
This why I hate Monty
TEMAZO
i love him sm
How it should have ended
I wish Steelwool would animate their characters like this video
Cool
Monty is my fav animatronic and this might be a terrible opinion but I genuinely loved it when Monty killed the other animatronics
I've never seen such a good FNAF animation in my life
THE ANIMATION IS SO SMOOTH
the "Knock 'em dead, son!" written on the poster is killing me and also breaking my heart! how sweet. maybe he took that a bit too literal.
Me and the 7 monty fans cheering rn
Terrifying Giga Monty scene there
And I thought Roxanne had an ego problem!
The animation is very bouncy! The way no one even cared about Monty, while Bonnie has all the attention while making Monty’s backstory more violent This song is amazing & the staff boys are screens & pixelated is cool, 300,000/10
Rock N Roll.🐊🎸⭐️⭐️      Monty is the only one that should have the stage. 😉👍
Total cinema 🖐️🗿🖐️
even if this wasn't a fnaf song, I'd STILL love it because its just THAT good
monty having a bonnie poster scratches my brain to well like his admiration turned to violent obsession
Poor Freddy man he got the most brutal death
Мне понравилось 👍
only a day old and I can't get this song out of my head
for some reason the out lines makes the video way better
isso realmente acontece no jogo?
Adsesese
My favorite animatronic!!!!
🙏
2:07 GREEN SCREEN MONTY DOING THAT TIKTOK DANCE
Nobody talking about how crazy the animation is. So smooth
A huge suprise to be sure but extremely welcome one at that, goated as always Tomb.
Definitely my favorite song from five nights at freddy's (and the song is from my favorite character from security breach,which is wonderful) 🤩🤩🤩
it feels like everyone agrees that security breech could've been it's own masterpiece and we're just trying to make it that
me when school is over just not having people too die
00:58 lo peor es que en el juego existe esa mancha en el cristal, explicaria porque esta ahi
This is so 🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊
We always hate you monty ;)
Can we all agree that when we saw multiple montys it was a reference to that one glitch?
Oo LOVE all of this! Awesome work on the video too! :D Super fun to watch
Never dissapoint
He took inspiration two games we didn’t need and made a masterpiece of music and Montgomery gator lore and it’s just the best upbeat FNaF song ever
That was the most rhythmically satisfying murder I've ever seen.
Cette chanson est trop COOOOOL 🎉🎉🎉🎉😎😎😎😎
I love Monty. He is my favorite.
YUHHHH
bro is literally king k rool
Awesome Song!😍
GIGA MONTY !?!?!?
Rok and roll !!!!!!
THE ANIMATION IS SOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOD BRO, also great song
Anime name?
McGwire!!! Oh, I love this guy! I have so many of his songs on Spotify.
very good :0
🐊
Yet another TLT banger and BLINDSPOT W animation
2:06 he was doing the FNAF dance meme at the greenscreen haha!
This is so cool. Keep up the great work. I love the videos
Holy the such good animation and the song this might be the best fnaf song that came out this year
♡♡♡
MEGAMONTY
stop making music zionist
The killings of 25
Beautiful. Song AND animation.
Knock PM dead, son!! – Dad  Who is PM?
this kicked ASS, great job TLT and McGwire and everyone who contributed to the visials!!
that good song when i watch i was like monty when others from 2025 what i hate like brainrots other people talk about gen z be 2020 labubu other kind i hate. sorry to bring this out. but hey is good song i say 10/10
The "You are so much nicer than you gotta be" heavily reminds me of Savlonic - Epoch, or am I crazy?
Another hit from the og
Beethoven returned from the grave and composed:
Giga Monty???!!! 2:08
Best Monty characterization in song form this is so fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
me encanta
2:05 Anyone else notice Monty doing the TV TIME in the bottom left!?
1:03 who else saw the Mimic in the back?!
Why I must use VPN to watch this?
I LOVE THIS!!!!
I’m so excited to see y’all perform, it’s so cool seeing y’all make VGM again!!?
Se lucieron con esta cancion
amo demasiado el video es literalmente arte las referencias todo es un banger😭😭😭😭😭😭
WE GOT GIGA MONTY IN A LIVING TOMBSTONE SONG!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️🐊❤️❤️❤️❤️
Btw I was the one who gave them a 11th like 😮😮
Thumbnail reminded me of Subterfuge
Man living tombstone with another absolute banger
why is the mimic in the corner 1:02
This is such a banger and worth the wait
So can I get another W 💀
rinrinrinrinringirininrinr pikuptefon
Me before this released: WE NEED A SOTM SONG Me now: Nvm I’m good
Does this confirm he killed Bonnie?
WE AINT MAKING IT OUT THE PIZZAPLEX WITH THIS ONE🗣️🔥🔥🔥
oh TLT i could never hate you
MEU DEUS VOU SURTAR UMA NOVA MÚSICA QUE PERFEIÇÃO 🎉🎉🎉🎉
ROXY SONG PLEASE
THE MUSIC  THE LYRICS  THE ANIMATION   I LOOOOVVVVEE IIIIIT xD
I LOVED IT
TLT was better before.
W
2:08 On the left side you can see the wet floor sign meeting the clean-o-vac  (Also the wet-floor signs are so adorable 🥹)
I WANT MUSIC FROM THE MIMIC: "MY NAME IS EDWIN, I MADE THE MIMIC, IT WAS DIFFICULT TO PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER!!!!!!!!"
Tsumugi Shirogomery
🐊
This song remembers me to hooked on a feeling
Claim your Before 60K likes Badge!
THE ANIMATION IS AWESOME, THE ANIMATORS ARE HELLA TALENTED (the poor cleaning bots face expressions- 0:59)
"Freddy it ain't personal" proceeds to spend five extra minutes beating the crap out of Freddy
😭 good song just but why though....
💚
You know its a good day when the living tombstone uploads
Montyverse lore:
Peak, like there is no other I can describe it
This lowkey hits hard.
Finally a new FNaF song bro we needed that
I want to go to the concert in portland but its sold out 😭
Imagine Coryxkenshin seeing this
Huge W
This is so good
Fantastic ❤
Hate this STUPID gator
Went to a concert of you guys a couple weeks ago, it was so cool! You guys really know how to hype up a crowd
Giga monty
0:54 These are sick shots 0:57 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 0:53
Yall this is so good! 🔥
Classic song
A
I still think it's crazy how Freddy says Monty is his friend in the game 💀
It’s been long bro😢😢😢I love fnaf music
Never thought we'd see a FNAF song from you again, after so many years
Eso suena como... Alastor game?
Al principio se escucho como la musuca de alastor😂😂
This animation is actually peak :) *As I proceed to almost break my computer seeing you are on tour*
MY FAVORITE BAND IS THE LICONG TOMBSTONE, I USED TO BE BORDERLINED OBBSESSED WITH  GLAMROCK BONNIE, AND IM GETTING BACK INTO MY PHASE.
We need a mimic song next!🤖
IM WAITING 9 YEARS F9R FNAF 6 SONG AND THIS IS THE SONG?
BABE WAKE UP ANOTHER FNAF TOMBSTONE SONG JUST DROPPED 🗣💥
YO NO WAY
I think this is TLT's first character focused song for FNaF, and I'm all for it! I love how upbeat this song is 🔥
well the song is good but the video clip doesnt make much sense since monty and  bonnie where like friends or smth and bonnie gaved his guiter to monty himself but besides this im addicted to the song
This is terrible and makes no sense. Monty didn't even kill Bonnie. The song itself is also not great. Overall bland and boring.
How Giga Monty overtook the pizzapex
1:38  I was thinking of making a surprise attack here.         But I never thought they'd hide under the car. I even less expected them to surprise me with the car.
Lovebit
As much as I hate Monty the animation is beautiful🥹
This song got dark way too fast
This right here. This is peak
The worker bots be angry at Monty and a second later they getting kidnapped Like the five kids
Naaah thats a very G4Y jealousy bro
Is this the giga monty takeover?
i am gonna see you guys on Oct 12, 2025 at House of Blues Orlando its gonna be so  fun!! ☆*: .｡. o(≧▽≦)o .｡.:*☆
I like how he sees Bonnie as the problem at first and then realizes everyone else still has more of the spotlight than him so he decides to just kill them all 😭 anyway THIS IS PEAK! The animation is so bouncy and smooth 🥹✌️
This is amazing and I love that the ad different pieces of there songs ❤❤❤
The voice sounds just like schlatt???
Nice
Fabolus
Amazing
The Song: 🕺 The Lyrics: 🤨 The Animation: 😳  Another great banger by TLT. It's murderous. 💯
Wowzers
1:43 "Dear Freddy it aint personal" *goes savage only on him*
Where sun and moon?
buenardo
HOLY SH!T
Classic.
I didnt understand what were monty reffearing When he sayed "may I have another W?" but I truly liked it tought (if someone could explain me, please be patient I have autism)
Screaming rn this ending was absolutely awesome the MM song in the bg was legit the cherry on top of the already 5 star quality cake
I thought they stopped making fnaf songs!!!!! This is such a W!
Wait the animation is so fire dude like
A bop
NEW SONG BOI
I love how the song isn’t as intense as most FNAF songs are, like I know the lyrics talk about beatin up glamrock Bonnie, but the beat is so like flowy and upbeat and chill
MONTY SONG?!
The vocals are really nice
Coryxkenshin aint coming back with allegations and now this😭🥀💔🫩✌️
was that a refrence to that one monty glitch that made clones?
I love it I love 10/10
Monthi is a f%$#@=×+
Iiiinto the playlist it goes
FREDDY NO
This song is immediately going into my playlist its so good
Me: oh this song of monty is so coo--  *monty has a relatable outtake*  me:well fu--
Peak
Security Breach may never be as good as original Fnaf, but Monty, your one of the few good things to come from that game.
Me estoy dando cuenta en casi al final con el robot del piso mojado aparece el clean a bot de secret of the mimic juntos XD
The production value on this is impeccable, feels like something out of a movie
🗿
Love the animation and the lighthearted tone of the story!
"MICHAEL DONT LEAVE ME HERE" ahh moment [2:03]
THE CLANKER KILLED BONNIE😟
Golden Freddy
I think cory would absolutely hate this song 👀👀  But I think it's a bop! 😁👍
this is such an earworm it’s stuck in my brain
My new favourite fnaf song
Amazingly amazing
It’s just crazy how much fnaf songs have evolved over the years, we went from choppy Gmod animations to full on rendered animations. I’m glad to see the evolution in fnaf songs
Monty was literally itching to slime out the whole Fazbear crew for top billing.   But it gave us this fire song, so I guess pretty worth.
GIGAmonty x100
Reminds me of Smile HD LMAO
Less than 24 hours,also this is amazing!!💜💜
ITS THE MIMIC 1:02 TOP LEFT
i love the animation sm amazing job
This is actually really good—the song AND animation. I was simply surprised to see a second TLT song for Security Breach a couple of minutes ago.
Wait I smell something..  is that the living tombstone cooking again? 🔥
Why is it so shoooooort
I LOVE YOU MONTY 😭😭
i love that he collects some of the rockstar animatronics accessories like correct me if im wrong but he gets bonnies cape and guitar and either his or chicas shoulder plates and then roxys glasses, i loveeee it
Finally a good Monty song that also sounds like Monty singing it! Now all that's missing is a Freddy centered song.   I always found it Ironic that even though Freddy is supposed to be the lead singer of the band we as far as I'm aware have no idea what his singing voice sounds like. What a bummer. 💔
fact: one of the endings in security breach, monty becomes THE main face
The (*crack! Smash!*) goes hard
FIREEEEEEEEE
Hell yeah, such a banger  🔥
the story the animation is telling makes no sense but the song is good
worst game, best song
this is so Wow
1:11 my favorite part
nuevo temon
2:06 giga monty!!!!!!!!!!!
Love seeing history being made ❤
Honey! Honey!! God came back!
The Giga Monty anthem
MI VIEJO WEEE!
1:06missed opportunity to say "oh bonnie boy, you're such a gas, but it's my turn to play the bass.
Imagine an alternative ending man, that would be so cool……   Please do it🥲
This is so fire
Mimic song is better ngl
Why did the mimic make Monty a murderer? Is he stupid?
Btw yall Monty didn’t kill Bonnie it was the sewer staff bots cuz vanny said disassemble Bonnie and sewer bots only listen to that command
DAMN, i never fought that fnaf songs in 2025 can be that good. i still remember prime fnaf songs this is epic.
Thankfully nobody died
Why does he look like that
Monty solos the verse
Gas
I think Roxy segment is animated by Sprin and Freddy segment by Tynado
The animation in this is amazing!!!!!!
Wow Monty song is cool and i can see now what he did to Bonnie 😢
That surprised me quite a bit.
Uuufff it's very good 🛐✨ but I hate you Montyyyyahsbkaskjsjnfbfb 😂 but it looks very good ajdbjnsn AAAAA 😂
FIRE
This reminds me a lot of One Night At Flumpty's
I love it, I hope the next song is a big SECRET
1:57 Just realized this sounds vaguely similar to that one part in its been so long.
I didn’t notice the mimic until someone pointed out.
unironically the best fnaf song creator
new fnaf song yay
21 hrs ago!!
Love thiss
why does it sound like ai jschlatt in the beginning
New fnaf song of the living tombstone!?
Woooooaaaaaa One of the greatest fnaf songs of the year
Sick
0:21 is fire
wow. that's all i can say.
Monty song, wait, what the 67?
Ellos nunca me decepcionan...❤❤
its crazy how their animations get better every song they make
amazing
Animation is so peak
This is absolutely fire 🔥❤️🔥
Fire
Giga Monty reference? 2:08
1:10: Monty didn’t attack Bonnie.
This is peak❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Neckhurts
OH MY GOD I LOVE THIS
Give some W's for Monty!
peak
I found myself vibing to this the night after release at like 3am
This might be the best FNAF song yet, and that's high praise. The video is so amazing, really makes it special. Honestly perfect.
Wait a sec- IS THIS CANON?!
This is Monty at his peak as a character. A selfish envy driven monster who is entitled to the admiration of the audience. Willing to kill and ruin whoever he needs to get the spot light.
This is 🔥
Thia is a banger
This song sounds similar to Alastors game. At least the style of music and how the lyrics are delivered.
Chick hicks lore be like:
glamrock freddy would fight back i think?
2:06 oh my god, giga Monty!
STEP ON IN, STEP ON HIM, STEP ON UPPPPPP
THE KING RETURNS!!!!!!!!!!! This was so good!! Like always, really. The goofy cheery vibes were amazing and the animation was beautiful!!!!!!! I dont have words really, lol your work just blows it out of the park
*The FNaF Song's Legacy Continues...*
This is sick!! Love itt!🥹👏
featuring dart monkey
I eat atomic bombs.
rhyming pair o' claws with deserve applause... so goated...
So tuff
The legend just uploded
Killed it
the living goonstone is peak again✌️🫩
this is just amazing omg
Absolute cinema
Peak Song As Usual
this song cured my computer. (Litterally- it used to pause in the middle of videos and ever since i watched this it hasnt done that)
Welp this song is about Monty, i guess
Yoo nice cuz it slaps😊😊  Pin me and I will sub
giga monty is real
Everything about this is absolutely amazing! The music is so Living Tombstone, but the new voice is magnificent!
lowkey enjoyed that animation so much and don't know why
JD Vance when he realizes that if Trump dies he gets to be the President:
Cool video. If you do not take into account the fact that you have blocked its viewing in another country. As a matter of principle, I dislike this
Somebody needs to send this to CoryxKenshin
Animations are peak
Then he gets defeated by a homeless boy
1:41 BONK
Amazing video FNAF TLT👍👍👍
I need people to make gifs out of the wet floor bots in this video PLEASE
1:03 do you guys see the mimic in the back
The contrast between the catchy and cheery beat of the song and just showing Monty committing robot murder is honestly just amazing. 😅
monty just murdered everyone 😭
🐻🐇🐊🐺🐓
Can you do a song on Secret of the Mimic next?
This is fire 🔥
AMAZZIINNGGGG
This animation is better than the spiderverse
2:06  Giga Monty reference?
This gives high hopes vibes and I'm all for it.
Chomp
Ngl the song didnt hit that hard but the animation... WOW that was good
FNAF is a core 🔥
(:
The animation is peak NGL 🔥
I always love songs that represent bad things through a positive perspective. Like how "Captain Jack" represents a heroin addiction as a saviour from a sad life, this song represents Monty killing out of envy as him taking his opportunity to succeed, and something about that deeply tickles my pickle.
This is so fire
No way i experience a new TLT song and its Monty
Mid
This is really awesome! I love the music and animation! But the clones Montys makes me laugh! I did NOT expect that the animator would add the Monty Glitch in the animation 😂
Wow this is a beautiful song and wonderful   Great job   I love Montgomery Gator
The most cheerful genocide song😂
YOU GUYS FRICKIN COOKED ON THIS ONE!!!
When there's Monty, there's goes Missing Bonnie
Dios. Por que cada tema que sacan es tan goooooood , joder , que buenas canciones, una maldita belleza  ❤❤❤❤
So good !! 👍🏼😮
the scene where there is all the montys reminded me the famous monty bug in SB where you can duplicate monty a lot of time, the monty rumble, giga monty that is another bug where monty is just unstoppable, that's a cool reference if this is it
i am sorry but this was not what i was expecting i mean the other fnaf songs were fire
🐊
Yeah
Peak!!!
Dang finally early for sm
wow👀
love this song im huge fan of fnaf so i love the beat the voice and music good job guys-guy
0:53 Rantaro Amami reference
0:40   I love how all the Glamrocks act in this scene and how well they got along with Bonnie.
We love toxic Yaoi!
PERFECT I LOVE THE LIVING TOMBSTONE
Step on up to the spotlight finds your face
1:49 capitão america: eu entendi a referência
The quality and the song are both excellent!! 🐊 rock and roll!!
Why the hell is clean o vac at 2:08
I was here
To this actually goes hard asf
fire, already have been listening to this way more than once
,ヾ(〃^∇^)ﾉ
Love this song‪:) 相変わらず全てが最高すぎる...!!!
Giga Monty army: the animation
Amazing!!!! This is one of the best songs ever
2:08 Funlly enought, there´s a monty doing Gamnanm style dance up the stairs
0:30 is when I start liking the song
The fact that monty is one of the first animatronic/suit is crazy. He is a legends too
Added it to my Spotify playlist as soon as it dropped!!!
Wasn't Monty innocent? Didn't many youtubers prove he didn't kill Bonnie? And In a roller Coaster, it shows Bonnie handing Monty the Guitar.
Ahhhhhh this is blessing my ears
2:10 “ how bad could I possibly be? “ ahh monty😭😭
New Fnaf song!
𝕆𝕄𝔾𝔾𝔾 𝕀 𝕃𝕆𝕍𝔼 𝕀𝕋🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤
0:15 0:34 0:35 0:36 0:37 1:07 1:11 is fire 🔥❤ and reminds me of 2015- 2019 fnaf
Babe wake up new the living tombstone
Mmm croc
here's my rating . . .     The music honestly isnt my style nor is it realy TLT's style but the animation is something else
Wow new song
Reasonable crashout🙌
Monty wanted to “seize his moment.”
That is his true nature in the game.
Headroom?
this will go so hard for the next gen of fans🗿
Do i hate monty? Yes. Am i obsessed with this song? Yes
This song is the goat 🧡❤️💚💙
애니메이션 퀄 지리네
i can't stop listening to this
The animation is amaizing
PURO CINE WEON
🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊
No way they dropped another fnaf song outta nowhere WE UP FR‼️🗣️
Such an amazing, unified song and music video. The ideas aren’t just creative but the execution is flawless. This might take the cake for the best FNaF music video I’ve seen!
DUDE THIS REMINDS ME OF SORRY JACK AND GOOD OL DAYS SO MUCH ITS LITERALLY BRINGING ME BACKKK
beutifull lol
To short
YOO TOMBSTONE COOKED IT WITH THIS ONE WALLAH
New FNAF song, no best. But cool)
2:06 THE MIMIC!!!
I think the fact that this takes the idea that Monty would be a solo act if he could from that one golf level and runs with it is incredibly clever! Pairing that fun concept with wonderful voice work, beautiful both stylized and expressive animation, and setting it all over a song that is just as high quality as everything that I've come to expect from Yoav and Sam just makes this a really nice surprise! I wanna point out how fun that choice to replace the drums just before the chorus with breaking sound effects is and how well it's always paired with the video, especially that shockingly brutal bonnie kill; all just one nice lovely package!  TLDR; I loved this, great job! Keep it up!
Love this song
EPIC!!!
This is fire
Good banger song 🗣️🔊🔊🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
We all knew he killed Bonnie for the spotlight! It’s also about time we get a Monty backstory- and FNAF songs based on security breach 😈🫶🏻
Fried rice at eddys new song release?
Okay, some references I definitely can see: 'I think I'm finally getting over you' might be a reference to one of JT Music's very few Original songs 'I'm Over Being Over You' 'Pay Me In Exposure too' is Maybe a reference to NateWantsToBattle's biggest Original Albums, 'Paid In Exposure' 'See you can hide, but You Can't Hide from me' is a definite reference to CK9C's Sister Location Song, 'You Can't Hide'  Whether ANY of these were intentional is up for debate, but if they are, then it would be cool to see TLT giving props to other Nerdcore Artist's stuff.
Ey you must make an song to secret of the mimic too or mabye an poppy playtime chapter 1 song too? But this song is so freaking good bro keep it up man :)
Am I the only one who thought this one was bad?
Is giga monty living tombstone - fnaf sb lore now? 😂
Fnaf 6 song plis 😢😢😢😢
I made a long hour playlist for anyone who likes it that much I know I do cuz YA GOTTA STEP ON UP STEP ON HIM STEP ON UP
This is Monty’s world
2:16 Picture of Monty and his dad in the back, on the left - “Knock ‘em dead, son. - Dad”
Step on in! Step on him! Step on up! Slams hard
WOW!!!!
I can relate to this song and I have fallen in love with it!!!!❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉amazing job!
I CAN'T STOP LISTENING TO THIS!!!
i love how in the end you can see on the left side something about death from his dad 😂😂😂😂
Nice lil bop but kinna short and no beatdrop tho 8( the animation is immaculate
The quality is insane this is so peak 🔥🔥
I think I've just found my new fav living tombstone song. Great job everyone
STEP ON UP!!!!🔥🔥🔥
THIS SONG IS SOOO FIRE🔥 but one problem i think im addicted to this song now😅
THE LIVING TOMBSTONE COOKED!
At least let my boy Bonnie get some warning first before you smack his head into the glass where you severed his L4 vertebrae
2:01 Roxanne: "give me back my eyes"😭 Gigachadmonty: 😎
But original FNAF will always be my favorite, FNAF 1,2,3,4 and Sister Location
Nice song
I-Is this a new F-FNAF song from TLT?!!!
TS SO PEAK
Listening for life
Another incredible animation from blind spot
I love this band For a long time And they only know how to improve
Monty's K,Rool fantasy arc.
I love that they use the theremin, it is an instrument that fits very well with these songs.
"Freddy it ain't personal" **Spends the most time ripping him apart** Yeah, sure does seem just a tiny bit personal y'know?
as a guy jealous of my friends' skills I connect to this, just with 99% less murderous tendencies
✨🎧♥️
this sounds like a classic i would listen in the 19s
yet another peak song!
This reminds me of that one Dead South video where each of the band members get knocked out.
monty is so cool when he sings so much and being good at playing
On one hand Monty got a new song following One Bite and Montgomery Gator sings  a song but on the other hand, he’s a fucking murder machine in here and kills not just Glamrock Bonnie but all the Glamrocks and the staff bots just because he wanted the spotlight to himself which is rather selfish but expected from the gator, unfortunately though Vanessa and the rest of the Mega Pizzaplex staff has to deal with the aftermath of it, thankfully it was just a fantasy dream Monty’s fantasy dream.
Woah!! Such i cute little bonni-  *gets killed after becoming bsfs with roxy and the bots*
This is honestly the worst song you guys have made in a long while.
The Goat is back
Pre 4k comment
This song just fits month so well dude the tombstone is truly living again 😎
A little quiet could you make a slightly louder version
fire just fire.🔥🔥🔥🔥
waiting all my life for a good fucking monty song, giving up hope, and then the living tombstone delivers. maybe happiness is still possible in this life, guys. new monty song from the living tombstone showed me that.
GAAAATTTTOOR GOOOLLLLF

Guys....Monty has evolved
LESGAUU
BANGER!!!! <333
Monty murdering spree? Noice. ❤
I can imagine how will the gachatubers will have the Glamrocks of watching this and their reaction
Fnaf is BACK!
YOOOOO NEW VID
Princess and the Frog vibes!! I love it!! 💖💞🎀
where would the internet be without tlt
FNAF SB IN 2025????
Omg a song of one of my favorite characters who nobody seems to gaf about for some reason even though he's super cool made by a pioneer of fnaf music?? I win
i love it when TLT casually drops peak content
This is a propaganda video. Monty didn't kill Bonny. Great music video!
please play this at the concert
Cory would like a word with you...
LOL i just realised...That Monty basically killed The 4 Animatronics Like Afton killed The Original 4 Fnaf 3 Minigame Reference
I've heard it 10 times now, help me, I can't stop listening to it, it's very good.
The animation so good i cant stop listening its amazing!
The music and animation is kinda fire. Yk?
Can't wait for Cory to react to this
First extreme clanker killer is a clanker, wild
W song
I love how the first design kind of looked like Monty from sotm(the alligator/or croc in the welcome thing is named Monty)
yay new fnaf song
After not liking rust this feels like a return to old tlt and it makes me so happy
Yup , 10 years later living tombstone is still only doing bangers LMAO
Watafac, la animación es preciosaaaaaaaa
I feel so late, yet early
that was actually real good
ANOTHER BANGER
Astralspiff refrence?? 2:10
PEAK
The best song about fnaf 9 how I love your songs about fnaf please continue to please us with these masterpieces 🎉
The quality of these videos are amazing, also the music, HOLY SHITTTTTTTTTTTTTT THIS IS FIREEEEE
Синима
Good
Hell yeah
This song gives me justice for monty. I have no idea why. The song is just to catchy.
w
OMG WHATTT THIS IS SO FIREEEEE
This song is so cheery, and funny
WOW que buna canción 🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊
Is there legit anything else Fnaf related that needs a song..?   (edit: I just realized sotm exists)
this is not canon, we know that monty looked up to bonnie and dipised freddy
1:03 the mimic
Dang it this is my 10th listen Sighn its a bop
I love that this is so incredibly fitting with the Rust album themes on top of Monty literally being green 💚
I had the biggest crush on Monty omg
EXCUSE ME? 12 HOURS AGO?
0:55 Oh! Oh that’s gore of my favorite character…
what is this
I can't stop listening to this work of art
The song is giving Randy Newman vibes and I love it
monty went coo coo loco
Keep going, you hero!
Would smash
This Is so good!
Wake up honey, we're 15 again with no job, problems or bills. Just Fnaf
My little sister said, "This is why AI is better than human animation"... Who's gonna tell her...?
😮
I love seeing some Giga Monty representation!
monty is baddas
as a former Monty hater, this made me instantly love Monty.
It’s such a great and cheery song about Monty killing all the animatronics
Monty 🤤
comment before it gets crowded😁
oh my goodness this is peak
This is 8/10 for me! I love it and I guess my only problems are nitpicks and not actual problems with the song or video itself. Like Monty’s characterization that I see kinda differently and I kinda wish it was a bit longer but really not anything wrong with this. The vocals, music, lyrics, and animation are peak. Definitely a new favorite overall
ROCK AND ROLL!! 🕶⭐️⭐️🐊
11 hours ago is crazy
AAAAAAAA COMO LE HACEN PARA SACAR TAN BUENAS CANCIONES ESQUE NO LO ENTIENDO AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I like how this was all his imagination lol
(FIVE NIGHTS AT FRADIESSSS)🗣🔥🔥🔥
Cory would hate this video 😂
Cinema
Shit
“Oh wow he’s gonna have a glow u- nope he’s killing everyone ok”
Welp... That explains pretty much what everyone speculated about Monty so I didn't feel bad when I wrecked him (😅/😏)
The SFM legends under BLIND_SPOT CG team so cooked...
this actually sounds like an old living tombstone song. i like it.
2:06 GIGA MONTY
This is a banger
We’re so back baby
Sounds like the alistor song.
An actual good monty voice that sounds nice.
Новая песня? Круто!
Ooooh this is absolute art
I wasn't expecting a Giga Monty reference lol
2:16 Mate eso nunca paso/ Mate that never happened
Me gusta como suena y muy buena animación
This song is SO fun and catchy, I adored this so much 🔥 Yall cooked!
Wait this freaking amazing hell yeah! The living tombstone always delivers, always
1:15 personal fav replay button
Basically the story of a narcissist Crocodile.
Babe wake up, TLT just dropped a fnaf song
THIS IS WHY MONTY IS SUPERRIOR
he's tipping the scale
dayum
peak as usually
2:08 One of the Monty's is doing Tenna's dance
this is pure diamond bro 😭😭🔥🔥🔥
There's nothing about a new song from the new FNAF secret of the mimic?
Cool.
Monty getting his own song I like it
THE OLD DISNEY ANIMATION LOOK SO GOOD ON ANIMATRONICS
I have nothing to say but "Absolute Cinema" ✋😐🤚
its such a bop
Nice song!!!! Thats really cool
2:06 GIGA MONTY REFERENCE
There back !
Monty still my fave
This is incredible
Absolute cinema🔥🔥🔥
Ik it just came out today but this is SEVERELY UNDERRATED 😭
They made a song of my wife 😍
UNDER 1 DAY
I love this "monty mania" song 🐊👌
how lore accurate do we think this is
INSTANT 👏 CLASSIC 👏 TLT NEVER MISSES 👏 PERIOD! 🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣
THIS IS 🔥 YALL COOKED
Simplemente hermoso;3
I’m so glad that all these nerdcore rappers are getting a lot of notice now
Wow
2:06 alguien más ve a Monty haciendo el trend del chico de BurgerKing? XD / Anyone see Monty doing the trend of the BurgerKing guy? XD
living for this monty representation 💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
This finna be a classic
GIGA MONTY REAL
Hold on a second. Tombstone never makes another song for a single FNaF game. What's going on here?
This song is so good. I love the sounds used in the song aswell😆😆💕
My sleepy ass read it at first as "step on me" lool
✌🏼💚
Oh, hell yeah! THIS IS AWESOME!
Animation goes hard
Has anyone noticed its sounds like the song daisies by Black Gryph0n in the beginning
All things considered, this may be the most lighthearted FNAF song you’ve made.
I love this song  10/10
HECK YEAH MORE FNAF MUSIC!
1:16 this whole segment just sounds so dang good.
THE ANIMATION IS SO GOOD 🔥
0:49 gotta love the reference.  “You can hide, but you can’t hide!”
😮‍💨automatic banger
What a surprise! The song and animation are wonderful, as always, the living tombstone and mcgwire music does it again. ✨
This song just made my Labor Day weekend!
This song is awesome it almost feels like a Disney villain song from something like princess and the frog with a fnaf coat of paint
I honestly was not expecting for it so sound so good
Oh this is insane
0:53 😑I was exited for the song until I started murdering my friends 💀
0:39 i really like the idea that they all loved Bonnie
WE'RE SO BAACKKK
This came out of nowhere
DIIOOOOSSSS HAN PASADO AÑOS DESDE VUESTRA ÚLTIMA CANCIÓN Y NO DECEPCIONAN NUNCA, enserio me encanta, siendo sincero nunca le había prestado mucha atención a Monty porque me parecía un personaje no tan importante pero viendolo mejor, es bastante interesante su odio y celos, la razón por la que bunny rockstar no esta presente, muy buena historia contada en una canción.
I feel it’s obligatory for me to comment on this video. But it’s nice for Monty to get his own song after how he was done dirty in ruin
There's a vibe and a very specific song that the "Step on in, step on him, step on up!" lick reminds me of, but I can't remember the song's name!  Y'all killed it with this song, McGWire killed the vocals, and BLND_SPOT killed it with the animation!  EDIT: THIS LITTLE LIGHT OF MINE (LET IT SHINE). The version I had in my head was by Raffi, but Sister Rosetta Tharpe also recorded a great version~ Which considering that Monty is like a bayou jug band origin, the gospel hymn vibe works super well!
1:50 - 1:57 this reminds me or references Die in a Fire
They finally made a new song
ES INCREÍBLE ❤
That loud *THUNK* of Bonnie’s head slamming the window shook me to my core.
As a Monty stan, I love this so much.
Why does it sound quiet?
cory's bout to be fuming lmao
DANNNGG THIS SONG SLAPPPPPSSSSSSSSSS
AWESOME SONG !!!!
this is so TYPE SHIT ❤❤❤
hi i me rizzler rizzler is me me rizzler
Nice
Yo
Just as we all imagine such a "disappearance" It is so ironic how Monty could be programmed to envy the spotlight, and thus do what an gator does best. The rivalry with Freddy is so, so, so, sooooo personal. 🐊
I spent like 2 years watching videos and analyzing this I don't think Monty is the one that killed Bonnie I think it's Roxy there's so many secrets that tells you
I swear TLT's FNAF songs give me 100 years to live.
GOD is the Best music fnaf sb
I love the song  Just had me sith one doubt, Will that happen And its mostly obvious the amswer
this kinda reminds me of daisys by black gryphon bc its a cheery song on top of horrifyingly violent animation
What a beautiful animation!! It reminds me of the Spider-Man movie, all stylized
This sound like Tony story 4 soundtrack😮😮😮😮😮😯😯😯😲😲😲😲😲🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
AAAAAH MONTYYY, YESSSSS ME ENCANTA ME ENCANTA ME ENCANTA QUE ANIMACIÓN TAN INCREÍBLE Y EL RITMO ES TAN PEGADIZO UUHRHTHEHE AMO
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO POOR GLAMROCK BOONIE MAN
Ally the alligator?
This is why Monty is my favorite animatronic in Security Breach besides Sun/Moon
Perfeito sublime 😊❤❤❤ melodia impecável
This is actually cinema. 🙌
Bro I’m crying this went to hard
"Calm down, Monty, we're your friends!" "Shut up Bonnie, I'll kill you."
this is chopped cheddar
i love how in the intro with monty playing golf, the golfball he hits has chica's face on it, and later on in the song he uses a golf club to knock chica's head into a trashcan
This is hella awesome ❤
This song is so fun ❤
Monty channeling his inner Tenna in the bottom left at 2:06
2:06 Giga-Monty moment
As always, a masterclass !!!!
REVIVAN EL FAN-
Im alredy addicted to it. 😔
Hi
This is my favorite animation ever, more glamrock bonnie content for the fans since we get scraps,,,
“oh wow i love this animation so much— oh..oh..”
Buen tema, saludos desde México 🤚🏿🇲🇽
Absolute Peak
In the beginning is sounded like Alastor game💀
I love when Living Tombstone drops a new song, and I see all my favorite FNaF song creators in the comments
Temazo
What are they feeding these animatrors bruh.Amazing animation and story telling bro.😭❤
Man I wish I could make music like this because this is freakin awsome
Good
Gregoty monty and gregory🤨
OH MY GODD. THIS IS BLESSING IN MY EARS❤
The pat pats were there. They saw everything ALSO WTH GIGAMONTY
The goats are back
I
Amazing 🎉🎉
Just the fact that we now know what glamrock bonnie would 100% look like in game is so cool.
Gregory: I'm gonna revenge on you right now.
THIS IS PEAK🔥🔥
Finally Monty gets the love he deserves
The next Fnaf song until another year😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
love the special effects, reminds me of need for speed unbound
Of course the lizard animatronic can destroy every animatronic that he can see but he couldn't defeat a kid
yesss bouncy af
In the intro, the ball Monty is golfing with has Chica's face on it. Amazing foreshadowing.
YOOOO! This is nice! I now agree on that lore of how Monty killed Bonnie. 😸
THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER! I GOT A NEW COMPUTER TODAY, I WENT TO A VERY EXPENSIVE PLACE, SCHOOL WAS EASY, AND NOW THIS! YESSSSSS!!!!
Is Monty possessed by Gregory in this clip?
Great music and even better animation, the quality is jaw dropping.
Dang I wasn't expected that I am so glad that Living Tombstone posted again tho
wow i love this one <3 love the louisiana vibe to honor monty's roots !!
Absolute peak TLT
i am very green and im mean
0:50 OH MAH GOD THE WET SIGNS🥹🥹🥹
Why is Living Tombstone ALWAYS making bangers dude?
giga monty reference is crazy
0:33 "So do whatever it takes!" is foreshadowing, right?
Holy SHIT THE VISUALS AND ANIMATIONS ARE SO GOOD
BLIND-SP0T killed it with this animation. All the animators involved should be extremely proud of themselves. The music is wonderful too! Great job Yoav and Sam.
Thought the song was called “step on me”
Master piece 💚🐊
So that happened to bunny
Wow, i like it.
guys  I think he's going to kill bonnie
coming back again not just to make a quick fnaf song, but to be a fully monty focused song, is freaking awesome
O-O
Immediately one of my favourite songs by you!
this was deffo a demo for walk ahead of you
actually goes crazy what the fuck
Those wet floor bots are traumatized
OMG!!! McGwire x Living Tombstone is not a collab I'd expect in a billion years but I'm so excited it happened!! I hope to see more Tombstone collabs with nerdcore
the animation of the lyrics and the little green and purple scribbles going all around monty is SO cool, honestly one of if not the best animated video yall have done. Lyrics are also catchy as ever <3
what a guy🐊
Under 24 hours squad
Monty Overthrows the Pizzaplex
I don’t even like FNAF. But this is going on my Mixtape.
Peak just peak
I love how expressive both the staff bots and welcome bots are, considering they make very little expressions in game so it was adorable to see cute little interactions we wouldn’t usually see anywhere else.
literalmente eu
My favority Glamrock🐊✨
Giga Monty lore
Hermoso ahora toca esperar un cover
Esto es cine
Asi nasen las estrellas 😊🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
Why is this actually a banger
Oh no, Mega Monty has broken free!
man the animation is so good. i will always love your fnaf songs, can't believe it's been 11 years already
LET'S GOOOOOO, ANOTHER TLT SONG!!!🔥🔥🔥Seriously though, the animation quality is insane, this is literally Disney Grade Animation for a FNaF Music Video. Very impressing, well done!👏
1:04 I love how the mimic in the background is just watching monty dispose of a body. 😂
I love fnaf songs that aren’t obviously fnaf songs
those gacha life youtubers are gonna go ham on this song
Clanker on Clanker violence
i love how this song feels like a classic tombstone song, like when yoav used to make silly mlp songs or songs for asdfmovie you know? it gives that vibes, it's like you take Magic, then you take the adsfmovie songs and then you mix it with monty, and i *LOVE* it for that, also i SWEAR i saw a die in a fire reference here
Alternate timeline
Montgommary has a voice! 🐊
I never imagined they would make their own song along with a fabulous music video _AAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!_  🐊  *I can't believe it!!!! Really*
So this just comfirms the suspicion he actually killed bonnie.
This is an amazing song! McGwire is an amazing vocalist!!
me encantaaa
This guy still posts?
2:08 when you as a Zookeeper leave the alligators gate open:
Man, this song potrays Monty's envy and hatred sooo good, willing to do whatever it takes to be the main star of the show. (It's been 3 years since the last FNAF song + Peak FNAF 3 Reference) Another gem from TheLivingTombstone (like always!)
YEAAAAAaaaAAAAaaAAAAAAAA
I was not expecting a character specific song coming, and while it being about Monty makes sense because of his jealousy, it's still something I was just not expecting. Fire song as always! 🔥🔥🔥
Love it Good work
I just need the 🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊 in my system
0:46  1:18
this seem to give monty more justice then fnaf sb itself
desde aca de mi cacsa te digo no me gusto salu2
between this and King K. Rool's return in DK Bonanza, it's been a VARY good time for garters 🐊 🐊 🐊
ITS PEAK
Gigamonty...
This song kinda sounds like the Daisies song with Alastor, or at least reminds me of it lol. Fire song tho1!1!1 🔥🔥🔥
FRIEZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
THOS IS SO FIRE
Sounds good.
“ROCK AND ROLL!1!” 🎸 🐊
This is the *ACCURATE* Monty song tbh
AMEI
Damn
ANOTHER INSTANT CLASSIC FROM TLT !!!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
LETS GOOOOO MONTO-mfing-GOMERY GATOR!!!!
WE ARE SO BACK COMMUNITY
Thank you and goodnight!  ...  Aww, I'm nobody! GOSH DARN IT!!!
Adsolute cinema 🖐️🗿🖐️
lizard
I'm just noticing the signed poster from OG Monty saying "Knock em dead son!" after watching it a third time in a row!
Do you think I could use this for a video ?
Está ya debe ser de las mejores canciones de Fnaf.
OMG SO GOOD I LOVE THIS SONG!!!
Living tombstone is back with fnaf !!!!!!
Reminders of the past
Having the lead guitar being a bass and the bass solo at the end, really fits this song and lore wise very well. Amazing job!
Wow Monty song Back in 2025
I dont know why this is funny to me but I like it
THIS IS AMAZING!!!
Peka as always
Hola Erean
THIS WAS PEAK!
OMG OMG OMG
Oh my god this is going to be stuck in my head for the next month
Que buena animación
xStep
this is my third to watching this it get better every time
Don’t let Cory see this one 😰
Rhythm, Lyrics and Animation, all a masterpiece
THE MIMIC IS IN THE BACKGROUND HIDING
got a banger just before my birthday ❤❤❤
I joined FNAF world 2 years ago & watching a song premiere from The Living Tombstone for 1st time is priceless! 🧡 P.S. I also loved song was about Monty a character with few material so far who deserves more love 🐊🐊
0:57 Monty did Bonnie DIRTY
TO PEAK
OH MY GOD MONTY SONG
🔥
100000000/10
Daisies ahh vibe
Die in a fire 2
I was so invested in this song that when I first watched this, I didn’t even notice that Monty was killing the animatronics one by one.
Peak song!
Moral of the story: Monty is a mass murderer who has his own domain to hunt, and he targets everyone who threatens his spotlight.
MY GOAT MCGWIRE!?!?
HOLLY SHIIIITTTTT
smile hd 2.0
make MLP songs again pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
This is soooooooooooooooo goooooooood
Giga monty reference???
monty is like the rep for blacks
I open my computer and go "Sh*t new song dropped" I listen to it, and I go "Sh*t, this is one of my new favorites"
This gives me daisies(black Gryph0n)vibes
This is so good!!!
Monty  song
NO I WAS AR SCHOOLLLLL
The animation in this is really cool
PEAK
The perfect song for a cartoon intro
TLT made a fnaf song in 2025? world is healing❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹🔋🔋🔋
The Living Thombstone just keep surprising me more on every video they do ❤
This is why you dont meet your fans
Monty hitting a golf ball with Chica's face on it at the beginning is such creative foreshadowing!
THE ANIMATION WHAT THIS IS INSANE I LOVE THIS
Monty was the best animatronic🐊🐊🎸🎸 And he stronger one on Glamrock
This is fire 🔥
I gotta admit the song is fire
peak just dropped
(Same guy who got the Gojo treatment btw)
🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪⬛⬜🟪⬛⬜
I hear 10 seconds into this song and its already really fire. That just shows how good of a band The Living Tombstone is.
It's peak 🗿
This song gives me "I walk ahead of you" vibes
So very Whimsical
THE VIDEO GOES SO HARD. AND THE SONG IS SO CATCHY
WHERE IS THE PIZZERIA SIMULATOR MUSIC VIDEO?! 😭💀
absolute cinema. Animation is absolutely incredible 🎉🎉🎉
Mega Monty Yippee!!
COOL! :]
Nah bro Monty is insane
The poor cleaning bots witnessing everything
IMMEDIATELY WENT TRIPLE PLATINUM IN MY ROOM💯💯
Nunca decepciona nas músicas, eu cresci escutando suas músicas ❤  (2:06 o Monty logo em baixo da estátua me lembrou a o luffy se transformando no gear 5 contra o robi lucci 😄)
Bro he said "step on him" like bro💀
I love how this is probably his fantasy every time he wrecks his room
The poor guy was done so dirty in the games. Monty... redemption arc?
I SCREAMED
Pause at 1:41 at it looks like an average sibling disagreement.
That was good
Is this just a modern die in a fire
THIS IS SO EPIC OMG
come to Brazil..... again
Another tombstone fnaf song to my collection
TLT is back. 🔥
giga monty? Is that you?
Nice
Looks like Monty wants some of the clout too
Wow very good.
Awesome song Monty.
Una moneda pal Monty 😢 🙏🏻
It should be illegal to have a song this catchy 😁😆
And again A new masterpiece
Wait the fazbear company has so much money so why don’t they just make another glamrock Bonnie instead of using Monty?
La animación es buenísima
Holy shit the animation quality!
Giga Monty Spotted
NOSTALGIA
Ngl this is a banger
I love this in every way! From the animation to the storytelling and of course McGwire finally getting the recognition he deserves. Trully peak.
2:07 Just like that one buff Monty glitch
can barely hear any of the vocals because of how drowned out they are by the instrumentals
2:08 tenna dance!??!?!
Absolute cinema ✋🗿🤚
THIS IS SO GOOD I WISH IT COULDVE BEEN LONGER 😭😭
YOOO THIS IS A BANGER
GREAT DAY TO BE A MONTY FAN!
Epico
I just noticed the mimic oh my god
I really love that we’re finally getting to see animatronics have their own personalities in this franchise. Their AI was never really the main focus in the first phase of FNAF, because of obvious reasons, but it’s really interesting to see this new element to them. Awesome song and animation!
OH MY LORD PEAK
The living tombstone, making five nights at Freddy’s songs gotta to be the most greatest times to ever listen in the YouTube platform.
DAMN! THAT SONG IS PEAK AS HELL!
imagnie a glamrock bonnie song
I liked this cover
Florida lore
banger dropped out of nowhere
this was fire, yall literally never fail fnaf songs thankyou guys 😞
Glamrock Animatronics: Glamrock Freddy Fazbear Glamrock Chica Glamrock Bonnie Montgomery Gator Roxanne Wolf
Bro this is peak
Shit hits so HARD, ABSOLUTE ROOT BEER 🔥🍺✨️
this fr a certi hood classic
Freddy: Trys too hard  Chica:🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕  Roxy: self-conscious  Monty: anger issues
Ooooooh! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
It's so brutal yet the song is so goofy
Quality is crazy good
I need listen this song in LATAM
this is animated SO gorgeously oughh im obsessed
love that this song is based on that theory where monty basically killed glamrock bonnie out of jealousy also btw this song is fire, clasic TLT flavor! i love you guys ❤
oloko, musca nova
It reflects the character very well, what a great song, thanks TLT!!!
The animation is really clean and looks good! W song too!
Monty if Gregory possessed him: the song (really good song though I LOVE this so much ❤)
Obsessed with this one !!!
The living tombstone, never miss
Justo estaba viendo edits de Fnaf 😂
LETS GOOO
okay just wow
Another song for the absolute banger playlist
Banger
What genre of music is this?
🕶️👍
Of all characters why monty?
Why does the music sounds so whimsical while Monty kills everyone 😭🙏🥀💔
This is so peak…
That last third of the song Really reminds me of the Legend that is Giga Monty.
i'm still not convinced it was monty, at least not on his own control  we know for a fact the mimic was in the pizzaplex, and was roaming free until greggory and vanessa locked him away
GUYS WAKE UP NEW LIVING TOMBSTONE SONG OUT
I liked it a lot, I'm your fan
THEY MADE ANOTHER ONE?!! also, this is the first TLT FNAF song that is only about one specific character, which is cool!
OH MY GOSHH  HIGHKEY GIVES ME CHILLS AND FEELS DOWNRIGHT HAUNTING AT TIMES!!!!  DEFINITELY ONE OF MY ALLTIME FAVS! 💚 💚 💚
🤔 Do I hate this guy or is this guy cool
Monty is criminaly underrated
OH MY GOD, NEW LIVING TOMBSTONE FNAF SONG IN 2025?? LETS GOOOOO
Muuy buenardooo
for god is soo good
The song being called “Step on up” for character who now canonically has no legs 💀
Bros hair 😭
New the living tombstone song and Forsaken update in the same day? Boy are we lucky
Monty became the narcissist animatronic ever
Blessed are we, for a song has come to be
Amigo es literalmente la mejor canción que he escuchado y el vídeo, es oro!!!!!
Dontchu dare hurt my virtual dad Glamrock Freddy
I'm actually here for a tlt fnaf song 😆😌. Amazing song
WOW so good ❤
It's so good for Monty arc 🙌
absolute BOP
when is the mlp sona coming back
Volvemos a lo clasico 🍷🗿
LETS GO a Monty related song!! 💚💜💚
This is pretty peak ngl
This makes me want to stomp on others to achieve the greatness that I *deserve.*  Thanks!
Hay que rezar para que hagan la canción de FNaF 6 🙏💜💜💜
Wao,no sabía que seguías activos, fuisteis mi infancia y nunca os olvidaré,ni yo ni nadie❤️
Is that a gigamonty reference?
Please make the song longer
The Goats is Back before GTA 6 🔥💯💯
Giga Monty using only 1% of his power
Super Mario reference😢 0:01
My honest reaction 😦
Monty got issues but good music 🔥
Yo the animation is a 10/10 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
0:57 with the banging before the chorus is so satisfying
2:07  So this is what gigamonty is!
Bro the animator cooked!!!!! This is such a bop❤🔥🐊 I guess you can this rocks and rolls!!
5 hours ago...
Hano on what happnd to this room in security breach? 0:20   Note:how to did this little fuzzy hair gator trun into a literal menace? Like I like this version of monty before the"gator who took Bonnie's place"...  After watching it:oh...that did not age well...and roxy is gonna be very upset
I've BEEN sayin he's best character in the series, this song only reaffirms that
this got released ON MY BIRTHDAY
WE WERE WAITING EVERY NIGHT
Diosss la animación tanto como la canción es una bellezaaa♥️♥️😭
This could be the Billionare Anthem
The wet floor bot signs ⚠ are SUCH a great thing to the game and it's amazing how well and full of personality they get here in the animation!
Alright, a new Living Tombstone Fnaf song!😄🤩😎👌
This could be starscreams, squidward, vegeta, donald duck, and daffy duck's theme song.
naaaah que buenaaaaa
We put Lacoste with this  🗣🔥🔥🔥
I always come back
i love 1:16-1:34 . it gets very "Country" . monty cant forget his origins. Love it TLT!
Who thinks we should have a Monty spin-off game that explains his origins?
BRO... this sounds amazing its so catchy and fun I love monty so this is an instant like
sborra
Sounds like an alastor song but better than that stuff
Btw could u pls make a fnaf6 song
If this animation wouldve had been showed up while the peak of hype about fnaf sb I think it would be a pretty BIG different wave in the time
The king lives!
highkey ass
THEY MADE GIGA MONTY ANTHEM
Nice
This is may not be a SOTM song but still fire
masterpiece
Amazing ❤
This is so “Die in a Fire” coded ✋😫✨I love it!!✨
AMAZING 🎉 I didn't believe I'd hear a TLT song about an animatronic who's not possessed, but it is depicted as a sentient being with his own wishes and insecurities. Now i am hoping to hear a song for each glamrock animatronic.
Genuinely shocked by how incredible the animation was on top of the great song!
1:38 😰
1:54 love the Die in a Fire reference
I love the way “hearin’ them love me, just like I see them love you” was sung, amazing
Monty smashing Bonnie face in instead of asking for a autograph
Never thought I'd see Monty with curly hair or a cape 😂
PEAK AS USUAL
love
This is Cory's Ultimate nightmare😭😭
This song could either give Monty the benefit of the doubt, and go the direction of him being passed the torch, or it could go the route of him being evil and burning everything to the ground  edit: tsk  EDIT: Nvm, it was all just an intrusive thoughts angle, I can live with that
I like to imagine Monty running up to Glamrock Bonnie like Markiplier, lol
1:04 is that the fucking MIMIC in the top right
Wow very cool very gator
Another living tombstone banger as always 🔥
Clanker on clanker action 🥀
the rhythm of this song reminds me a bit of Alastors Game
This reminds of "More, More, More" from Arlo the Alligator boy
Holy hell I already know people will start glazing thing song so much that they start over hating even more for This Comes From Inside
Gatorific
I guess you can say Monty wants everyone else to *die in a fire* so he can be the only one that's best in show..
YESSSS A NEW FNAF SONG AFTER 1 YEAR
67
Its weird how awesome that arcade place looks and feels, like more than half of me is going "ah I wish I could go there, never mind the killer animatronics and the giant robot spider or the evil pdf serial killer ghost.... it looks way to fun!"
Oh heck yeah! Now this is a song my nephew will like, as always. Keep up the great work
....👍
So happy to be here before this blows up! Also pleasantly surprised that SB is still getting songs, I miss it, tysm! 😄
I have one question, so now will you do a song for every glamrock??
Holy Shorts! This is CRISP
1:02 Wtf is that thing in the window
LETS ROCK! 🗣️🔥
Absolute fire
amazing anniversary for fanf 1 song
Simply our dear Tombstone returned with this wonderful musical animation congratulations for all the work this was wonderful
yoooo crazy but hate monty tho
Oddly inspirational
Wait till cory gets a load of this lol, really good stuff yall!
this might be the best characterization of monty ive seen yet from a fan project..
Never cared for Monty. But this song on the other hand...💚
The meaning of peak
I just want to add that just like ALL Foxes parallel Michael Afton's life, so also ALL alligators parallel William Afton's life. UCN is the only exception, there Michael and William are swapped. So yeah, Monty luring Glamrock Bonnie into Monty Golf and leaving his ded body in Bonnie Bowl just to be later ruined, armless and drowned by Glamrock Bonnie themed neon sign is parallel of William Afton luring Cassidy Andrews into the safe room, springlocking her in Fredbear, just to be later him springlocked in Spring Bonnie by Cassidy Andrews, get ruined through 30 years, getting armless into FFPS and then tortured by her till she had enough. This mirror started in Fourth Closet where Cassidy Andrews replaced Jeremy in Bonnie, the same book trilogy where William Afton said that getting springlocked is drowning in your own blood. And this is continued with the FNAF1 Movie MCI intro where the big focus in on Bonnie kid eliminated as the last with red screen. Roxy and Monty are also the only Glamrock animatronics who replaced Foxy and Glamrock Bonnie respectfully, and the only Glamrock animatronics who are purple colored. Yeah, Roxy parallels Michael Afton's life, particularly FNAF4 bully part and SL missing eyes part. Michael Afton's iconic animatronic in Foxy who Roxy replaced. She's a wolf. You know who also got replaced by a wolf? UCN Highschool Chica has Chica in MCI+Charlotte squad replaced by a wolf while herself parallel William Afton. Like father, like son. Pig Patch there parallels Cassidy Andrews, her last postion to getting springlocked.
Everything about this video is absolutely majestic, great work TLT & Co.!!ヽ(●´∀｀●)ﾉ❤
Pretty chill and upbeat for a song about a robot brutally unaliving other robots
WE NEED AN INSTRUMENTAL TLT
Bro WHAT HE IS ALIVE
Absolutely awsome!!  Loved that my favourite Glamrock got a song
It was good, but Monty didn't even kill Bonnie; it was the staff robots. Vanny set the staff robots to disassemble Bonnie. I have proof. Look in the room where Bonnie's body is. You will find the Staff robot parts in there.
Giga Monty's theme.
Waw
YOOO AAGHAHAHAHAH THE ANIMATION IS SO FIRE AND THIS SONG MAKES ME WANNA CRY because of how good it is HAHAHAAGAFYIYFA TYYYY
WE'RE SO FUCKING BACK Y'ALL 🗣
No intense vocoding, no like (I loved this)
Yay new fnaf song ❤❤
0:01 to 2:34 is absolutely fire bro 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥
The volume is low
if this sucks I'm donating 5 bucks to Team Water
the volume is kind of low though
THE BEST ❤‍🔥🔥
holy crap a new tlt song that I like
Elegir al instante classic in my opinion❤
This is why we tore him in half 😼
The song is amaizing
I LIKE THIS SONG NOW🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Bro sayed Fu-k you bonnie
So good

I SEE YOU MIMIC
AAAAAA AAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Wooh! Gator golf!
I love the Monty that was doing the Mr. Ant Tenna dance.(I don't play undertale or deltarune so please correct me if I'm wrong.)
Banger as always guys ♥️ 👍
Oddly enough this gave Jax vibes from the The Amazing Digital Circus for some reason, maybe because I just too videos talking about him.
I like how Monty is "green with envy"
Me unveiling all the references I missed in the comments.
HELL YEAH
Interesting
Aaaaabsolute masterpiece!!!!!! Such a banger and a incredible animation
Hace 4 horas.. Me perdí una obra maestra
It seems monty backstory happened glamrock Bonnie destroy FNAF SB and FNAF SB ruin
I love this. MONTY WILL ALWAYS BE MY FAVORITE!
Step on up fnaf 🐊🐊💚💜
I hate Monty but this song goes so hard
This is Banger 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥
1:50 "Eye can't see LOL" Nahh Monty went off the rails with that one 😭
Man TLT never misses!
the living tombstone, back with peak as always
This was amazing!!!
THIS IS THE PEAK WE GREW UP ON BACK IN 2018 FR
Animation,lyrics,melody it’s all beautiful You guys never cease to amaze me.❤
Monty with full locks of hair is just a new level of cursed.
DO I SEE GIGAMONTIES RUNNIN IN THE PIZZAPLEX
Love how in the lobby scene Monty was filming the join us for a bite dance lol
Love❤❤❤❤
Good stuff
This released on my birthday! And it's probably my favorite FNaF song! Thank you, McGwire, Sam Haft, and everyone else who helped make this, for this MASTERPIECE of a (unintentional) birthday present!
New living tombstone fnaf music in the big 25?!
" -Deadpool- kills the -Marvel- Universe "    Monty                     FNAF
Nice touch, having a glamrock version of SOTM Monty as Monty before stardom!
Is it possible to be in love with a tune??
WOOF Mongomery 7w7 🔥 🐊             (POZOLE!🐊)
monty sucks as a fnaf character I'm ngl
fnaf songs are so back
the motyverse is real
It sounds like daisies of hazbin
actually goes really hard. Great job on this, never expected any less from the goats.
I can fix him
Why does he sound like Caseoh
Cool song!
Revivió la músics estimados
It's crazy, that TLT doesn't want Russian listeners to listen to their tracks, and I still can't understand this decision.
Giga monty takeover
I've heard better,but not bad
This is 🔥
That was another good song 👍
1:35 NOAH (new human animatronic) WHERE ARE YOU…PROTECT CHICA
that animation is fire tho
bro watch catching bodies 😭🙏🥀
now one to fnaf into the pit, please
Markaplier is gonna shocked that his theory is wrong because he thought Monty was the true hero but in the song he basically kills everyone just to be the star of the show  Just only him
You guys keep getting better and better! I think I can speak for everyone when I say You guys are amazing! Keep up the great work!!!
Another song by tlt 🔥
AME LA ANIMACIÓN Y LA CONJUGACIÓN DE PALABRAS UGHHH., los amo TLT ❤❤❤
Montgomery Gator: For me?   Roxanne the Wolf: …
Poor Bonnie 😢
LA MEJOR CANCION DEL SEGUNDO XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
OMG!!! MONTY WITH LARGE HAIR❤❤🩵💙🩵 MY SUPERSTAR
I fucking hate Monty but this is a pretty good song
youre a bit late
Wow, I forgot I saw this premier ing today 2 days ago
gia monty mentioned?!
Un temamos de fnaf en el 2025 ,  tengo fe en la humanidad todavía 🙏
Absolute peak
0:49 "You can hide! But you can't hide!" - Monty
GOATED!!!!!!!
You music very good! Perfect job!
1:49-1:54 And how will Gregory know that his new and future dad Glamrock Freddy was murdered by Monty at the Mega Pizzaplex? 🥺😭
peak
are we not gonna talk about Monty doing the Burger King Guy dance on green screen? (Wonderful, absolute banger. It has to be in my top 10 already)
I love how much emotion the staff bots and wet floor sign bots have in the video
Peak
Is this tuff?
I love how cheery and goofy the song is while casually showing him committing several acts of cold blooded robotic murder
1987/10
The animation is amazing 🔥🔥
AMO TODO ESTO ES FANTASTICO LA ANIMACION ES HERMOSAAA 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
MONTY SONG I LOVE THIS THANK YOU
YESSIR! This guy made my childhood song phase better!
Monty just slimes out everyone😭🙏
More like Step On Me AMIRIGHT???
2:07 bottom left corner monty is doing the tenna dance
didn't know i needed this song, but i did!!
this is incredible , this remember me to the old fnaf songs, TLT U ARE COOKING ! THANKS FOR THIS MASTERPIECE
Thank you so much for giving us another banger! 🫶
Anger issues are a b*tch, uh?
this is peak, i would have loved it to be in the concerts of the tour
Normally, Monty doesn’t destroy Freddy, Chica and Roxy.
0:21 "Be aware of suddenly opening doors" Nice lol
H E  D R O P P E D  A  N E W  B A N G E R .
🗣‼Step On UP
0:57 the syncs throughout the song are so fucking cool
1:36 Oh that's gore... that's gore of my comfort character
I’ve grown to enjoy and like Monty much more, yeah, he killed Bonnie (atleast the only way I can see the canon), but like Monty much more now, Bonnie woulda been great, though.
I love your fnaf songs
ABSOLUTE CINEMA
🐊
1:14  I just love this part. That progression is absolutely heavenly.
I love this song, but I hate Montey
This song  It's a very good song  It's perfect  It's like some kind of living tombstone   I'm the original                Six Gameplays
Another one already?!
Monty you beautiful lil guy
Little detail i noticed, In 0:03-0:15, the first 15 seconds they show the characters in order of death, First is the bonnie poster, Then the chica golf ball, the Roxy golf ball. and last freddy golf ball, Other detail is Chica’s death. Her head being kicked like a Golf ball. just like in the start. (Same thing happens here in same order 1:28 ) Some Funny Foreshadowing.
Chat I prefer jackies box
3 YouTubers in one comment is crazy 🤯
No one can say The Living Tombstone don't still got it.
That escalated quickly
This is freaking awesome, really love the animation how expressive and high quality everything is, looks better than the actual game too lol
"This Comes From Inside is clearly saying they're quitting FNAF" yeah right lmao
WHAT A CRAZYYY PIECE!!! I LOVE IT
Coryxkenshin won’t like this…
Hasn't even been 5 seconds and the tunes and visuals are already amazing! 🔥
Monty be alligatoring up bars bro!
That Was Amazing!!
A TLT tombstone fnaf song? in this economy?
Sounds like something Princess and the Frog
AMAZING SONG I LOVEEEEE IT
Goooooood
Good Song
Damn !!! That was a great!!!!
cinema
I think we've seen where Gregory might have got his ideas to take out animatronics from 🤣
Niice, nice. Very high quality mastering & rendering.
yeeeeeeeea
This will be a cult classic in 10 years.
Just a new banger
Algum br?
I love the fact the way chica dies is foreshadowed AT THE START when Monty hits a golf ball with her face
U made my child a music video?! HOW KIND U DESERVE A SUB!
era bom quando era dubstep.  até a musica de fanf 'This Comes From Inside' tava bom
AAA! literally amazing!!! I love this song so much🎉🎉
This is fire🗣️🔥 its already burnt, its dust💨
Yoo the video is AMAZING! (and so is the song)
You got this, Monty!!!
buen video musical buen tema sigan así  saludos de argentina
Oh hell yeah 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
This literally reminds me of Alastors game the song, also from TLT- :P
This is a proof of good craftman ship and a awesome freaking animation goodjob!! This could be on radio
I wish we got to see the glamrocks THIS animated back in security breach and W song

Bow wow bow wow
TLT, I knew yall couldn't stay away from FNAF.
I love this so much
The peak of peakness 🔥🔥🔥
You guys coocked it’s absolutely insaneeee
The animation is SO good, like almost the Join Us For A Bite remix kind of level- one of the most expressive 3d fan animations I’ve EVER seen! I LOVE the unique style that shows even with pre-made for the post part models!! We love seeing artists supporting each other!  Anyhow, music-wise this reminds me of an older tlt, it’s sorta nostalgic.  Also
💜
HOLY, THIS IS FIRE  New tlt fnaf song!!
Why is volume so low for this one 😢😢😢
monty's so badass!
Genuinely fire
Temazo🗣🔥
Esta good muy buena cancion
This helps me get through the loss of La Paśon.
Looove your animations💚
BABE WAKE UP, NEW THE LIVING TOMBSTONE SONG
Let go monty own song 💚🐊
here before it blows up
Such a banger 🎼🎶✨
3 hours ago?
THIS IS CRAZYYYY I LOVE U TLT !!!!! 😭💓
Wow. Didnt know they would suddenly drop a new one after a year
This is why I always go after Monty in Sb
We all just wanna be seen for once in our pathetic lives.
Awsome absolutely peak amazing
Nice work!
Zzzzz
Monty
THIS IS GOING IN WITH THE FAZBEAR CLASSICS
THIS GOES SO FUCKING HAARDDDD OH MY HGODDD MY BOY MY BEAUTIFUL GATOR BOY Y'ALL DID HIM SO MUCH JUSTICE!!!!  💚🐊
Usually when TLT post a new song, it's a piece of art that brings me joy and awe but this time... it also made me cartwheel yelling "YIPPEE!"
Bro the weekend started,a three day weekend,and this released,nice
Peak song honestly I did not expect tlt to make another fnaf song with the new appearance and stuff  lol
As someone who loves both Monty and Bonnie this is amazing
Very good animation
OHMIYGOD ITS SO GOOD
Absolute cinema
DAMN THAT WAS AMAZING!!!!! I missed these types of songs🥲
Just another BANGER!❤❤❤
This is so good ngl  I love it ✨
“Finish” mid “dancing secretly
A song about Monty in 2025? YES PLEASE 🤑👌
god song
ABSOLUTE PEAK
I didn't think Rust was in to FNAF
BLIND_SP0T absolutely killed it with the video, it's all really fun and expressive! I think my favorite bit is the chaos at 2:07 with everything going on there. (I noticed he also has a note from his dad in his room? That's adorable??)
😊💗
Total fire! Steel wolf might not love Monty, but we do! Awesome work!
Average Monty shenanigans
🥲 And this is why we communicate and not let our anger and jealousy get the best of us😭
Absolute cinema
Bro we need a song and video for each glam rock animatronic please. I need my Roxanne wolf song.
2:08 Sercet of bots in a one second
I love the art
My only issue with this song is it ends
Perfeeecct!  There should totally be a sun and moon song like this too! EPIC!
Aah!!😍
LIZARD LIZARD LIZARD 🦎🦎🦎
I like it
That was unnexpected😮
It's a good song
ha molao
BRO I MISSED IT!😕 I WAS AT SCHOOL😭😂
ive genuinely been listening to this ALL DAY.
I LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
PROTEIN SHAKE 🔥🔥🔥
Monty love yip
02:07 is that a reference to that 100 Monty glitch!?!
I love there songs and this one is pretty fire
IM LATE BUT HORRAY FOR THE ONE WHO GET MY CHILDHOOD I LIKE YOU THE LIVING THOMSOME [a fan from 12 years ago]
Peak
Nooooo my sheyla and pookie bonnie😢😢😢😢 i think this music will be Glamrock Bonnie song or he get heal. Song is realy good. But Glamrock Bonnie😢😢😭😭😭  Good day😂
This made me really appreciate how much character and personality they have to the animatronics in the game
What Amazing Song. ❤️
The animation 💔😍
The music and the animation just work perfectly. Monty’s rockstar rampage.
FIRE, ABSOLUTE FIRE
AANNNNDDD ITS PEAK!!!!!!
They cook again 🥹
They cook again 🥹
I didn’t like Monty already. Now I just hate him.
IT'S A VERY GOOD SONG, THANK YOU FOR MAKING ART EVERY DAY
I haven't seen the living tombstone in a WHILE, but I guess their a BIT late to the party
Is the living tombstone coming back 🥹
FINALLY A DOPE SECURITY BREACH SONGGGGG
Something tells me there’s some American Psycho inspiration for this music video. The way he goes from killing out of “necessity”, to recreationally, only for it to have all seemingly not been real by the end, major AP vibes
AMAZING!!!!
<3
I love the animation and that the staff bots had a lot more personality! Even though they're only seen in a few scenes, they BREATH "personality" just as much as the other characters!
Wondered what those videos were about.
Wow now it makes sense u took long to make a ruin living tomb stone because u needed Jung ban Monty 👌👍🔥🐊👒
I like to think Monty is the youngest animatronic at the PizzaPlex with would hence him having easy stardom for the band and being the newest attraction mascot no one cared about, which can obviously makes his evident small temper and naïvety.
WAKE UP EVERYONE TLT HAS A NEW FNAF SONG
Tommorow it will have 200m views fir SURE
Absolute cinema
dude this is amazing i LOVE the animation
Cool😎😎😎
W's in the chat
YO THIS JUST DROPPED AND WE DIDNT HEAR ANYTHING BEFOREHND? PEAK??
Crazy how TLT took a half baked background plot point and turned it into a banger song with genius animation and a better story than the entirety of the steel wool saga🔥🔥🔥
the tombstone is living
Fun fact: this is the first time in any TLT FNaF Songs where a Fazbear Character was named
This new fnaf song was awesome and it's great to see one after years
Lol this is Monty’s fantasy
YAY ANOTHER TLT
very well animated it looks like Monty is jealous he wants to take the whole pizza Plex for himself
Ótima música! Me lembra os tempos antigos!
yes
Where is Edwin
MONTYYYYYYYYYY, I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!! He's genuinely my favourite character so I'm so glad to see him get his own song, even if he does commit mass murder in his mind! 🥰🥰
Fire
1:39 as someone who absolutely hates Roxanne just for replacing foxy as a classic fan, this is 100% deserved and I cheer on my boi
Well done
DEATH BY BOWLING BALL?!!?!?!!?!! 0:53
YOOOOOOOOO WE ARE SO BACK!
Porra
Good music
Let’s gooo nice song the living tombstone nice work!
78k views in 3 hours delete the channel mt
I think that this its an Interpretation to William afton
A NEW SONG OF FNAF FROM THE LIVING TOMBSTONE BEFORE GTA6
This has easily been the most love Monthy has gotten since the Alpha Monty glitch (which I believe the end is referencing) was discovered, he went very overlooked otherwise. Very neat to see.
i hope this means that they'll start to make different songs based off of random fnaf characters. This was surprisingly good, even though i dont care about monty that much.
78k views in 3 hours bro fell off
Say, that’s pretty good!
FNAF security breach MONTY KILLS EVERYTHING ending
Im just speechless. That's just amazing in so many levels. CONGRATS!!!!!!
Both the animation and the song were incredible!!!!
i was late to 6 th hour for a masterpeice
This is so peak.
THE MIMIC IS BEHIND THE GREEN SCREEN AT 2:07
0:56 rip bonnie
Yeah I'm not gonna lie this fucking sucks you want a really good Glamrock song stick with jt music or the stupendium they've done it right
Mate, eso nunca paso
what is this referring to? other than the game heavily implying monty brought bonnie out of commission, is the rest of his “murder spree” a reference to anything or just fun?
i love you anger issues reptile
CoryxKenshin would hate this music video! To my Samurai community out there!!!
SIICK
Why is the song so quiet
I haaaate Monty, but man this song slaps🔥
What a great music video and song! I loved this song, but I wish it wasn't short.
This is peak
Really fun song! The lyrics and the animation tie in great to Monty's crazy ass ego👌
Love the animations and song ❤
WE ARE SO BACK 💀🔥🔥🔥🔥
Peak as always
Let's go Gator Golfing where Monty then clubs you in the face
You guys SHATTERED with this song!
giga monty real :O
This is fire
Official banger
;-; we missed him there it felt off we where proven right to have that feeling
Why is this so fire bro
Monty will feel the wrath of a thousand suns. it's on sight
Yo this fire
Banger without a doubt ❤
gawd the vocals are soooo good 😩
Ok if monty did attack bonnie , how is that even possible. Was he corrupted or something.
Once again a banger
uf quedó fenomenal
This is so peak! I love it! I love the animation and the interactions with the Glamrocks! It's so good! I feel so bad for Monty though. He is my favorite FNAF character, this video made him seem like an outcast and the others just didn't care for him and wanted nothing to do with him. I just want to give him a big hug. I don't believe he killed Bonnie by his own will. I think it was the virus that altered his personality that made him kill Bonnie. I really do believe there's more to Monty than people let on.   Regardless though, I do love that my boy Monty got a song. Thank you so much Living Tombstone.
SQUEEEEE, a Monty song?!
such a w
bro this made my day!
ALL THE GIGA MONTYS
something about this feels a lot more lighthearted than the usual fnaf songs.
I love the story in this one!
THIS IS SO GOOD!!! THE VOICE!!! ITS AMAZING!!! ITS SO GOOD FOR MONTY!!! I AM TWEAKING!!!
WHO LET HIM PICKED GENOCIDE ROUTE 💔
Poor Bonie She/He did NOT to end up like this Bonie is my favorite character
What about secret of the mimic
Im here!!!
❤❤
HOKY SHIT??? I WASN'T EXPECTING THIS!! ITS SO GOOD WHAT
2:06 NOT THE MONTY DOING THE BURGER KING GUY DANCE
From Golf to dissasembling unit what a character development 🪕🐊
Good music 👍🏻
I ALWAYS COME BACK!!!!
Fnaf ruin song great
Good job
what if i step on down huh
OMFG that's the point to be a starting of fnaf 2 fr. Just look at the damage parts of the gang
the living tombstone has done some big hits, the fnaf 1 song is an example, and this is a close second
Die in a fire 2 bruh jhkshjks
The last part means that fnaf sb is just a daydream
This is why i agree with cory hating on monty
I wonder what security breach would be like if bonnie fr showed up.
damn bro killed someone just to play bass that's kinda sad ngl
Gigamonty in the atrium, Spiff would be so happy
ahhh man, this is awesome music!
Cant believe fnaf songs are still being made peak
To be honest monty is the  number 1 best character in fnaf screw bonnie
Love that Monty get his on song 🥹❤️
🐊🐊🐊LIGHTS CAMERAS ACTION ROCK AND ROLL!!!!!
2:06 GIGAMONTY REFERENCE???!?!?!?1!?1
Que gran canción
THERES NO WAY YOU JUST DROP A BANGER OUT OF NOWHERE WHAT THE HECK😭😭😭😭
I LOVE UUUUUU ANOTHER AMAZINGLY COOL SONG 🤍🤍🤍
Literally Monty killing everyone in Videoclipe
this song seems catchy to me idk
So weird this is the first fnaf living tombstone song focused on a specific character I wonder if this will open the doors for other characters???
That "you bring out the best in me" line is so twisted and I adore it.
This is a pretty banger song
Perfection! Everything about it is Perfection! I've been looping it since it dropped and have no plans of stopping for the foreseeable future!  Thanks for the gift of this! 🔥🔥💜
I liked the music👏👏👏
THE GOAT IS BACK
THIS SONG IS MORE FIRE THAN THE FNAF 6 ENDING!
This depiction of Monty is so cool
BEAUTIFUL SONG, I LOVE IT
Why does this gives me The Alastor Game Song vibe?
Yes! Fnaf music!
It's only assumption that Monty killed Bonnie. Roxy is suspected too, Freddy less, at least Chica wouldn't probably do it.  (yeah i saw whole video, and i know it was "just a dream").
Make 20000 more fnaf music I loved this one!
Monty got the Monika syndrom in this one.
oh we are so back
THIS WAS SO COOL!!!!!
𝕄𝕠𝕟𝕥𝕪 𝕞𝕒𝕣𝕣𝕪 𝕞𝕖 💍💍💍💍💍💍
2:07 is that giga monty?
FIRE🔥🔥🔥🔥
THEY'RE so backkkk
LOVEEE THIS
I do t like it no often ce
I'M EARLY??
0:53 My scar is reopening ;'(   G.Bonnie...
IT'S OVER LET'S GOOO
can you do FNAF into the pit song or secret of the mimic pls?
2:06 Mega Monty Army, Spiff would be proud.
THIS IS SO PEAK
I seen monty doing the tenna dance
1:02 IS THAT THE FUCKING MIMIC AT THE SALE?!!
WHERE'S MY FRIEND INSIDE ME SONG AT.
NAH YOOO
not the best song in the world but is ok
Thanks for giving some attention and love to Monty, one of my favorite characters in the franchise.
Well that turned psycho way faster than i thought
Two hours wow
The best Animation I ever seen.
0:57 😢🐰
in efec its cinema
Oh. OH. OH I THOUGHT THIS WAS GONNA BE SOME RANDOM INSTRUMENTAL BUT OH GOD MONTY SONG
The animation quality Is super crazy!!!
He dreams of evolving into Giga Monty
1:54 die in fire reference ❤??
Damn, didn't expect to see McGwire anywhere but western style music.
Es la mejor canción me encantó 😍 mucho
Me gusto mucho pero dura poco
🎵🎵🎵🎵❤
This is a frikin banger
And the caution bots were just watching all the murders go down the whole time.
This is truly my fave song
🐊🤜🐰🐻🐤🐺
So hyped for my grand grandchildren to study about this in 200 years 🗣️🔥
We need MORE ! Maybe Roxy?
This aligator has some serious issues.
im under the 10000 comments!!!
This was sooo good🫰🏻🫰🏻🫰🏻🫰🏻💋💋💋💋💋💋💕💕💕💕💕🐰🐰🐰✊🏻😍😍😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😊😊☺️☺️☺️☺️
OK THAT SO COOL
Finally
monty went on a rampage 😭
0:58 RIP Glamrock Bonnie one of my fav versions Of Him
Five Nights at Monty's
Amazing song, animation is top ❤❤
"Monty did nothing wrong!!!" I say as they drag me away to a padded cell.
peak
best song i ever heard recently
Absolute ear worm and gonna be stuck in my head for the foreseeable future 🔥🔥🔥🔥
FINALLY ANOTHER FNAF SONG LETS GOO 😭🙏
I don't have as much as a connection to FNAF as other people do, but even without that I absolutely love the little story this music tells, plus the animation is absolutely spectacular and kept me repeating this one on loop!!! Two highlights that I absolutely adored are when Bonnie's face slamming synced up with the music (0:58), and the scene where Monty goes past the portraits and they get sketched over (1:58). Congrats to everyone involved in this, yall did amazing!!!
please do a sotm song i'm on my knees
I'd never expect Yoav to make a song about Monty! Y'all did great!❤️‍🔥
I feel like this is an elaborate reference to Long Time Friends
this dude's music is always better then what i expect, keep being a goat tomstone😤🌟
I really like the video
I’m still waiting for a FNAF 6 Pizzeria Simulator song.
to me the song felt kinda 1-note, there wasn't much meaningful progression and it just kinda kept going until it stopped
I love this song but I don't think Monty would ever do that, he really admired Bonnie from what I can tell from the lore, but it wouldn't surprise me if they made it canon
2:07 gigamonty reference
WE NEED A NEW SONG THAT IS LIKE I CANT FIX YOUUUUUUU (LIKE SO THEY SEE THIS)
I love it and i cant wait to go to your concert in 1-2 months
Giga monty😂
How Montgomery Gator (Monty) came to be…
another peak living tombstone fnaf song... the animation is also so fun and good its so expressive!!!! the entire sequence is so good uughh i cant stop watching
I've always been a fan of Monty, even with all the Glamrock Bonnie accusations during Security Breach. And this is exactly why. Even all the way to having it all be a fantasy in your room. This would have entranced middle school me, but high school me is absolutely going to loop and dance to this for years to come.
TEMPRANOOOO
Why do I feel like you do know about something that no body's Else know 😮
I like the idea that this song is based solely on that one glitch where Monty would clone himself 500 times.
These are the few robots/animatronics I wouldn't call clankers
NEW FNAF SONG HOORAY!
weird
Sigma
Amo su música TLT!!!  ❤❤❤❤Por favor! A la próxima, vengan a más países en Latinoamérica 🇬🇹
Holy Giga-Monties on 2:08
Canon?
i would love to see a roxanne wolf, glam chica and glam freddy songs now!
Why is every fnaf song yall make peak!?!?!
i would love to see a roxanne wolf, glam chica and glam freddy songs now!
PEAKK
Skibidi-tastic
new song?
Monty after killed bonnie:
Por eso su cuarto esta destruido Me encantooo ❤
they have not made a song in a while
🔥🔥🔥
Now I need the pizzeria simulator song 😭
Bombardiro...
this is fireeeeeee
These deaths are so comical. All it needs are cartoon sound effects
Oh fnaf hi
The animation is INSANE, amazing work over there
Monty getting a solo song? oh hell yeah!
This was so PEAK!!!! both the animation and the song itself! kudos to everyone who worked on this!
EVERYTHING IN THIS VODEO IS FIRE, THE  ANIMATION, THE SONG, JUST EVERYTHING 🔥🔥🔥
The Living Tombstone cooks Fnaf songs SO WELL
It's fire
I am the only one who feels like this is so similar to Alistor’s Game?
stop being mean to roxy or i’ll transform into my nightmare mode
YOOO THIS IS GREAT!!!
NEW SONG EVERYONE THERES A NEW SONG!!! 🎧 🎵 🎶
NEW SONG EVERYONE THERES A NEW SONG!!! 🎧 🎵 🎶
Love the personality given to the patpats   And the Monty glitch reference at the end
i love this song
darn the plot twist was wild in this one
Why is the video blocked in Russia?😢
Best birthday gift ever holy shit
Ayyy
Giga monty.
goddamn! that was some peak!
Right as I heared the voice and lyrics I instantly love this song.
2:07 The Monty in upper stairs is going to twerk 🙏🙏
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE THE STORYTELLING WITH THE MUSIC WAS ON POIINNTTT ❤❤
Whooooooa let's go McGwire and Living Tombstone!!!!
Another song that that will go done in history as a worlds greatest
Was the last lyric about the Thank you and goodnight, Hazbin hotel song?
❤❤🎉
CERTIFIED HOOD CLASSIC!!!!!! I loved watching this animation, loved the very different vibe from most other fnaf songs, just a straight BANGER. also loved the giga monty's LOL.
Another banger by the king of  fnaf songs
AAA
BAP
Amazing

Fnaf 3 song vibe when he start slaughter
We’re waiting every night for you to post a new. Video
Love how the staff bots and floor signs are animated
Genuinly one of the most incredible animated videos, ALL THE EFFECTS AND ANIMATION WITH PERSONALITY AND STORY THEY MADE UP, ITS INCREDIBLEEEEEEE and incredible work by the siNGER such a good monty voice and it sounds so good with the sONGGGG, kind of like TLT music from waaay back! not saying TLT has changed but this one is so catchy with the writting and way of singing and beats its amaziNGGG
Oh this made me so happy to see.  Well done all involved
Lol I love the reference to the Monty glitch at 2:07
Oh boy gonna be on repeat for a few hours
Yall killed that everyone on the team did a amazing job this is peak.But he didn't have to kill everyone like that tho still great video I really enjoyed it.
🐊
THIS IS PEAK REMINDS ME OF MY ORDINARY LIFE
Living tombstone always cooks with fnaf songs
Masterful music video!😎👍How did Ara Adkins contribute by “Mastering” in this video? I do not know what you mean by it.
2:07  Tenna , BK JUFAB employee, thanos dance, and Gangnam dance
First 5 seconds in, and I gotta say Ts is ass 🔥🔥🔥
Wth was that?
the vocals lowkey sound like caseoh’s ai voice is singing this
Fire
02:07 bk man reference...
I dont even like security breach but this was a bomb
FEATURING MCGWIRE??? OH KY GOD
2:07 BRO WHAT HAPPENED 😭
Un clásico instantáneo la verdad
Can you also step on me Monty
1:33 🤨
2:07 you can see the mimic peek behind the Greenscreen of the monty doing the join us for a bite dance!
Of course he went for Bonnie first 💀

Why does this feel like this music ain’t close to fnaf music in general?
WE’RE SO BACK
Fire song and animation 🔥🔥🔥
La-la-la-Lava ❤ 0:43

NEW FAV SONG
PEEAAAAKKKKK❤
Hi
That escalated instantly.
This song goes so hard at 0.9x speed
Fnaf aniversario 11
2022 monty loving me would be foaming at the mouth right now
IS THAT THE MIMIC BEHIND THE GREEN SCREEN AT 2:07???
Love how The LivingTomestone decided to break tradition and make a Monty song cus yes
HAN VUELTO!!!
Is fantastic❤
This basically feels like something that Sony animation would come up with, and I mean that in the best possible way. Aside for the animation being top notch, the extra visual effects combined with the lyrics on screen helped sell the 80s aesthetic the Pizzaplex was going for, as well as highlighting Monty’s darker impulses. The music and singing make this a top notch music video.  I would have to say my favourite sequences would be the scene where Monty attacks Freddy for how brutal it is, Monty attacking Roxy with his own hiding place just because of the hilarity of the idea and strangely enough the scene where the four band mates are together, which seems to show that’s the fourth of them are good friends just doing a job.
Monty is my favorite Glamrock. This song drop today made me so happy! YAYY MONTGOMERY!!! 🐊🐊🐊🐊
Nice
Diós mio lo mejor ❤🥺 ellos siempre saben hacér musica que te llega al corazón ☺️🇲🇽
Die In A Fire 2 with chill music
TLT always makes bangers from fnaf its incredible how long they made songs for the game
amazing
Not bad,but not good
No me lo perdí por una hora 😢🗿🐊
Well then.
I remember FNAF coming out when I was graduating HS. I did not keep up with the fandom. It's been like a DECADE and watching this with no context, knowing nothing beyond the hype around the first game is such a wild crazy ride.
2:07 Giga Monty mentioned??? 😭😭
Frdddy y Monty se aman y es canon, yo era la pared
YEAAAA
Una obea de arte
THE LEGENDS MADE ANOTHER FIRE SONG! I LOVE IT TLT KEEP OT UP ❤❤❤❤
Soooooooooooo basically Monty Gator kills everyone the song.  At least the little caution sign bot goobers survived.
Don't know anything about FNAF but the MV is so well done.
I loved Monty's song. It was amazing.!!Monty Giving His Story Hopefully you'll do a Glamrock Freddy  one Greetings The Livingstone >w<
I'm trying to come up with a King K Rool joke, but I'm drawing a blank.
Wow this is so much fun. I really like this a lot. TLT is like a box of chocolates. You never know what style you're gonna get.
I did not expect a Giga Monty reference, but this is an amazing song, even if it implies that Monty did in fact destroy Glam Bonnie
DIE IN A FIRE REFERENCE IN 2025 NATURE IS HEALING 1:54
FIRE VIDEO 🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣🗣🔥🗣🔥🗣🔥
ARE YOU ALİVEEEE
Godly
I don't know why, but this reminds me of Daisies by Black Gryph0n.
the paper catched fire while this was written
We need a song for nosey🫡
❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉moooore
I love monty
1:15 Reminds me of the song, Hooked on a Feeling. Great song! How do you make so many bangers!?
Lyrics:  You're so much nicer than you gotta be. A star and part of Freddy's Symphony.  Praised for your ability Charm and creativity They've always liked you so much more than me. I think they'd want me If I got a shot... To show I'm more than just a pair of claws prove that I deserve applause Practise till I'm good because... I think the band could have an open spot.   You gotta Step on up! Till the spotlight finds your face. Step on up! Till you have found your calling upon center stage You got style, you got ambition so do whatever it takes. step on in! step on him! step on up!  I think I'm fin'ly gettin over you so can I get another W? I'll get what I'm overdue Pay me in exposure too As long as nobody discovers you. See you can hide but you can't hide from me I'll never say no to my destiny You bring out the best in me I'll say open sesame to all the obstacles ahead of me You gotta step on up till the spotlight finds your face step on up till you have your calling  up on center stage oh, Bonnie boy you're such a gas  but it's my turn to play Step on in! Step on him! Step on up!  Out in the limelight Everyone sees you i think that I might just wanna be you hearin' them love me just like i see them love you If i control my destiny i know what I must do-oh!  Step on up till you fin'ly found your place Step on up till every boy and girl is chanting out your name Dear Freddy, it aint personal but you are in the way step on in step on him and him and him and him and him step on in step on him step on up!  Thank you and goodnight!
holy dawn, the animation is so smooth and the song is awesome, i love it
This animation was absolutely stunning, and it all went by so fast. 2:07 This is exactly what Monty would want to do, make a ton of other versions of himself.  Amazing job to everyone involved!
Very nice! Keep stepping it UP!
You know I’m listening this for 1 hour straight
Erm what
Poor Bonnie, the music is top!!❤
Idk, silly monty 🐊🎸
Es tan perfecto
This is lowkey fire
Bombardiro Crocodilo
i love how much emotion this gives the the wfbs and staffbots
I love how he spaps back to reality in the end. Made me let out a chuckle lmfao
THE GIGA MONTYS NEAR THE END IM CRYING
I LOVE MONTY IM SO HAPPY HE GOT A SONG
2:07 oh my god the monty with the green screen is doing the join us for a bite dance. 😭
ABSOLUTE CINEMA!!!

Early
monty solos verse!?!?!?!?
With Monty being my absolute favourite character in the franchise a song just based on his story is amazing
2:07 is this a giga Monty reference?
absolute banger
Monty at the beginning: i wanna be popular i wanna be the star of the show  Monty near the end: I'm a serial killer now
That's going in the playlist
The animation is just beautiful!! Everything about this is amazing
IM BARLEY 10 SECS IN THE VIDEO AND I ALREADY LOVE THIS SONG
Yet another absolute banger fnaf song from Tlt 🔥🔥🔥
Amazing!! 💚❤🐊🐊
OMG THE CLEAN-O-VAC AT 2:08 LEFT OF THE GOLD STATUE
Monty getting a TLT original before Bonnie? I think Bonnie fans took a fat L today.
hello guys today I am giving top 5 reason why I hate bonnie
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH UR SONGS ARE SO AWESOME OMG!! TYSM FOR MAKING THIS SONG AND THE OTHERS U HAVE MADE AGRAHH
The best song ever!!!!!!!! ❤
Rock and roll!🗣‼️‼️

This is awesome
Is it the hit that will rule my fy?
This is all I was looking for in a fnaf song
HELL YEAH ANOTHER GRAND FNAF SONG FROM THE LEGEND HIMSELF
1 hour ago
Peak is back
Can’t wait for Cory to see this 😭
crazy theory, now we know Fiona is the creator of monty gator and  is m1, and bonnie is a henry creation, and know the fnaf book story teller was controlling the place and m1 is the universe parallel, WHAT IF M1 TOLD MONTY TO SLIME BONNIE OUT 😭✌️
NICE!
The animation freaking cinema, Jesus!
TLT: Make a Secret of the Mimic Song: ❌ Make a song dedicated to Monty from Security Breach: ✅
2:06 I can spot the Mixamo dance, gangnam style, the Join Us for a Bite meme dance, the macarena, YMCA and maybe the Carson Shearer dance?
Temprano .para escuchar un clasico
YOOOO IM SO EARLY ONLY 1 OUR ALSO THIS IS A BANGER
IT'S SO GOOD!!! WELL DONE TLT FOR GIVING US ANOTHER FNAF SONG
I can relate to Monty, as a small artist struggling for recognition. It hurts when your passion doesn't receive the praise it deserves.     But I definitely wouldn’t go as far as murdering people just to be loved.
1:49 HUE HUE HUE 1:49
real.
Sun and moon song when??😅 I guess I can keep dreaming...
Watch future generations call this their og fnaf song..
This is going to have a special place in my "unhealthy Monty worship" Collection.
IT’S HEAT
Absolute peek! 😎😍
Can't wait for your secret of the mimic song
DID I JUST SAW A DIE IN A FIRE REFERENCE!?!?!?!?!?! in the minute 1:53 (im not sure if it is)
Absolute banger
this is amazing!!
Monty is literally committing genocide
MONTY     -MY HUSBAND-
Nice
Jesus Christ! Thank god this isn’t canon…
I love that Roxy is clearly looking in a mirror but is so fixated on herself that she doesn't see Monty with the big ass go-kart right behind her lmao
Awesome 😎💚
2:21 "Knock em dead, son" Well he sure did 😭
ts might be fire!!!

Another banger fnaf song from The Living Tombstone
Cool
Five Nights at Freddy's
oh this is a dang Good One alright
I'm glad that this video is going to raise Monty's popularity a bit, since it's the most bastardized glamrock and not exactly the favorite of most fans.
god this sounds so good 🔥🔥
This ate DOWNNNN
❤ I love u guys, congratulations to you !
Always a pleasure to get a song from you guys, you knocked it out of the park with this one! I loved the lowkey blues vibes this had, really brought me back!
0:58 Fuckin’ brutal
BANGER.
Increíble 😭
And i'm the end, Montgomery's dreams comes true...in the bad way
I wasn't so sure about this song but I genuinely enjoyed this!!!!

Cory was right....
Giga monty army spotted haha 2:07 This is such a nice song but also feels so out of place for a fnaf song. I think thats quite fitting for a sb character :) Nice to have yall back tlt
Monty on a killing spree (while singing a banger) 😭
nice
is this a giga Monty reference 2:07
I'm witnessing history in the making, like when I watched BIRDBRAIN by Jamie Paige
OH YEA ANOTHER BANGER BY THE LIVING TOMBSTONES
Bro got so jealous that he haded to kill Bonnie
step on me
1 hour not bad
I love the implications of Monty not stopping at just Bonnie but everyone else so that he’s the main star.
peru is key
This is like a telenovel story😭😭😭
0:56 Yo it was confirmed monty couldnt have killed bonnie in security breach cuz he didnt have his claw upgrade yet and bonnie had claw marks on his body!

Fite
New favorite ngl
I’m here before this hits a million views!! Also the animation in this video is really good 👍
Wow, Thanks, now I dislike this oversized lizard even more 😅🤣  Amazing song and video! 🥳  I'm literally a new fnaf fan that actually began to get into it a few months ago because Security Breach, and, while I'm part of the ones who knows the Monty Ride AKA Fazbear Entertainment explanation for Bonnie's replacement is a total scam, I do believe Monty has/had a huge hate problem towards both Freddy and Bonnie for being main cast and more popular, especially after the SOTM game. This video literally captured that perfectly! 🤩  The music is catchy, the animation is so smooth and the vocals are amazing. Fantastic job!! 🥰
It's fantastic
This song a b teir
I have a feeling, that FNAF fandom will live forever, because we have such kind of creative creators and loyal fans. TLT, thank you for everything you gave us 🔥🔥🔥
I like that it had some of that classic TLT sound in the instrumental. I've been missing it in most of your music the past few years.
CHEWS ON THE BARS OF MY ENCLOSURE.
Really good animation.
Sweet holy beats🙏🙏🙏🙏
Salió justo en mi cumpleaños que curioso👀
This song was amazing truly one of the best!🎉❤
This is Amazing Its now Apart of Fnaf History
The Video clip is INSANE ???
THEY ALWAYS COME BACK
A NEW GOOD FNAF SONG THIS IS WHAT I NEEDED THANK YOUUU !!!
❤
Another banger fnaf song as usual
i tought u were tired of making fnaf song!
i would never expected a fnaf themed song about montgomery gator made by the living tombstone but here we are, and its a awesome song
1 HOUR AGO????? OMGGG
This song is literally the definition of an earworm UGH it doesn’t matter that this  is so short this an instant banger 😭
NOOOO *cry in freddyxbonnie*

DIOS MIO
YAYYY MONTY 🔥🔥🗣️
20/10 and i dont need say more
and were is the die în fire reference?
This is so tuff
5 years later, this song is gonna be another epic nostalgia to remember..
I like how The Living Tombstone does the subtitles well with the Montgomery Gator melody. My respects, TLT 🗿🐊🐊
YEAH!!!! This is wonderful ! It's so catchy that I was singing along by the second listen!🔥💜🎉 Definitely top tier! McGwire is the perfect fit!
This is amazing
Bite Sized experience!
I came in here wanting a fnaf song but instead I got a Hazbin Hotel song.
Me and my friends watched this in vr and instantaneously got up and started dancing
BLINDSPOT KILLS IT AGAIN!!! I got to see the animation team work on this music video and they did a phenomenal job!!
ROCK N ROLL
Man... I miss these days
2:05 they are literally using an otamatone for this song.🤯

OHNT GOODNESS IT’S MY GOAT MONTY GATOR
Living tombstone always cook 🙌
I didn’t TLT would drop such a Monty song in the massive 2025 but 👀👀👀
ayy only 4 years late!
PEAK SONG HOLY HECK
Im actually there for a the living tombstone Fnaf song!
Wow
The song and the video were amazing! I really wanted to see a Secret of the Mimic song from you guys.
Damn my arms got goosebumps! Sounds so good!
In my opinion Freddy’s takedown was the most aggressive maybe it’s cause he’s the main star? Like in the one of the endings Monty becomes the main star so, I can absolutely seeing the happen. Amazing video!
Literally what i figured his motive was, or at least to get Freddy out of the way. He struck me as the kind of person who would do that
Wuaos
I'm really liking this actually, It's Hitting Hard! >•)
Wow…
I can tell if 2:07 is a reference to that one glitch where unlimited Monty's spawn in, if it is thats so funny, and there also so much random references in that scene alone like one of them doing the burger king sister location guy doing a tiktok, and one doing the macarena.
A Monty song?! Never thought Monty would get spotlight
Only 5,000 views and already in recommendations)
The many Monty scene is crazy They got Macarena, Gangnam Style, Cabbage dance, breakdancing, the fnaf burger king meme dance on a greenscreen, and some of them I don't even KNOW what they're doing
WHY DID MONTY SLIME EVERYONE??? 💔💔
(1:04) IS THAT THE FRICKIN' MIMIC?!
i think that was a giga monty reference.
1:39 Poor roxy got crashed by go-cart again 🙏 and btw song is cool asf
It's so catchy, I love it
Wow it's so short... TLT really did grow with each era, now we went straight into verse 1 since the start...
YEEES
Wow, this is my least favorite FNaF song from you :/
I LOVE THIS AAAAAAAAAAA
Wow la animación es otro nivel, además, una nueva canción de fnaf, justo entro a YouTube y me sale en recomendado
2:07 that one Monty dancing Tenna's dance lmao
the end shot with all the montys really makes me think this whole song was inspired by the multi-monty glitch LMAO
I love how catchy this is. Tlt never misses
Ok this banger DEFINITELY does my favourite Glamrock justice
Bro pulled a among Us
W
I like how this appeals to people who believe Monty murdered Bonnie, while still making it a "daydream" sequence in the end, so anyone who believes Monty is innocent can see the song as a simple power fantasy
So Monetary Legendary 🤧👻🎙️🔥🎧
Soo good ❤
PEAAKK
❤️
💚💜 Neat!
CLICKED THE SECOND I SAW THE NOFTI
2:06 GIGA MONTY REFRENCE?!

Cool
Just like the old times 🗿
Gigamonty at 2:07, I can't believe it
NEW IM HATE MONTY FOR REAL 💀
this fnaf song is so different but its so silly... I LOVE IT!

HERMANO NO PARAN DE COCINAR!!!

What a good animation that looks
YAAASSSSSSSSS

Im so happy they keep doing Fnaf music from now and then :)
FNAF!
Dejo mi marca de que estuve aquí
another one to add to the archives
Tlt dropping another fnaf banger, I love that its a song made for monty hes my fav out of the glamrocks, Song wise 1:15 is my fav part but animation wise (is also the one with monty taking care of bonnie with a bowling ball)   Is 2:07 there are so many funny dances like the breakdancing cat, gangnam style, Macarena, that stupid tiktok join us for a bite dance xD, head banging and some other silly dances, there is also one drving a scooter or something its just so chaotic and I LOVE IT   Take care everyone and have a wonderfull day/evening
This is adorable lmao
This croc has such a dark dreams...
🗿🙏🏻
glamrock bonnie still better than him
WE ARE SO BACK
Yep! MONTY VERY VERY NICE BUT ALSO VERY VERY AGGRESSIVE (I CALL IT!)😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏💚💜i love me. Periodbro
Instant classic like all other FNAF songs 🔥🔥🔥🔥 banger
oooo😊m
BEEN TO THEIR CONCERT THIS YEAR, AND A NEW FNAF SONG? HELL YEAH 🗣️🔥🔥
Did anyone realize that Monty in Secret of the Mimic was supposed to be used in Fredbears, and then Bonnie replaced him with Freddy Fazbear and the Gang, and then now Monty destroys Bonnie as revenge? I think that's a pretty cool parallel.
this was absolutely incredibly perfect. great job yall
didnt think wed get a monty song years after SB, but leave it to TLT to cook
holyshitttt this is PEAKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
Absolute Peak.
So Peak 🥲

PEAAAKKK
Less than an hour
Bruh It's not that it turned out good, damn it ! And literally perfect, I liked it!
I should’ve known I see a new video by the living tombstone and plus seeing Monty dream of him getting far better spotlight than the others really messed up his programming 😂
😮49 minutes ago
That was absolutely fantastic! I really enjoyed this song and animation!
I DON'T know if monty is THAT BAD! OK KILLING BONNIE YES! BUT THE HOLE FAZBEAR CREW NOW THAT JUST OVERKILL!!! SERIOUSLY YOUR THAT SCARY OF HIM AND WHY WAS THE MUSIC SO HAPPY LOL 😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
this both makes me wish we saw more (or any) rockstar bonnie personality while also wishing monty actually took over everything like the powerhouse he truly is !!!!
This might actually be the best FNAF song from this channel
MONTYYYYYYYYY
I WAS HERE
hii there
Quality as always! Absolutely loved the visuals!
Thanks so much for having me 🐊🐊
Hello everybody

BRO NO WAY WE GOT A MONTY THEME SONG IN 2025
Veryyy goood
Everything looks amazing but that animation...just perfect 🤌
You could say.. it’s been so long since I’ve heard a living tombstone song, so long that I wanna die in a fire. This comes from inside tho and I really mean it. But if you think this songs bad then I can’t fix you, I love five nights at Freddy’s
:)
I like how TLT doesn’t do a song about secret of the mimic because he knows he can’t top Jackie’s Box
How dare Youtube hide this from me for 48 minutes 💔
2:06 HAHAHAHA THE TENNA DANCE IM CRYING 😫😫😭😭
Please make a song about the secret of mimic😭🙏
Okay Montgomery Gator is my favorite
a fnaf song in… 2025?😨
Under an hour? Bet
holy shit the animation
I saw fnaf and clicked
"I ALWAYS COME BACK"  said Monty:
Wait this is fire I love dead gravestone
a ballad is so beautifully ironic 🥹
One wasn't enough, he had to become the center of the stage *even if it means that there won't be any competition*  Also, Bonnie got Rantaro'd
Genuinely amazing 🌟
This is so catchy! Love it!
Fire
🧌 RRRRAAADDDD
This shows how much Monty was jealous!
great as always... i just lovev The  Living Tombstone songs
💜💚💜💚💜😈💜💚💜💚💜 Monty is the best! Xd
The FNAF ERA IS BACKKKK BAABBBYYY!!!!
DAMNNNN❤
The living tombstone jumpscare
OMGGG I LOVE IT FINALLY A NEW FNAF SONG FROM TLT!! 🤩🤩
Fantastic animation, great job.
Lo admito pero la canción ni me gustó no superó las expectativas que tenía, creí que se superarían
ABSOLUTE FNAF CINEMA

Holy shit yall cooked. This animation is gorgeous
Don't let Cory see this 💔🥀
ITS BACK GUYS🗣🔥🐻🐰🐥🦊
Gives me that PURE TLT NOSTALGIA 🔥🔥 Love the portrayal of the animosity Monty has had with Bonnie and possibly the rest of the crew as well, this animation was phenomenally stellar to watch!!
Giga Monty reference goes hard
It’s been so long
As always, grateful for another FNAF song from you guys, this was awesome! Certainly wasn't expecting a Monty focused song though lol
This is probably the most love Monty's ever gotten, both in fan media and canon media.
I love how fan animations have more personality than the original game
REVIVIÓ LA MÚSICA 🔥
The Living Tombstone never disappoints 🔥🔥🔥
major old TLT vibes LOL
We are making out with this one!
i love it
Giga monty?!?!???
This is amazing
wow he really did it. he stepped on up. wow
It’s been so long…

Yaaayyyyy Monty Gator my fav🐊🕶️⭐🎸
the  animation  is so good
Lo que pasa en la canción es turbio pero también tiene un toque caricaturesco muy divertido
OMG this is great
Dude the animation and lighting is fantastically!! 💯
Temazo
Guys, you gotta Step On Up.
giga monty at the end 🥹
Great animation but a very mid song to me unfortunately... The vocals feel really weak and are almost grating rather than catchy and instead of jamming with the melody they almost clash with it (IMO)... I'm no music expert but the way his voice wobbles and drags out those last syllables sound terrible against the backing track which feels weak in the first place... It's really off putting.  Comparing this to any of the previous FNAF tracks it's night and day...
La animación fue increíble igual que la canción
Another one for my playlist
2:07 Giga Monty!!! Giga Monty is *REAL!!!*
This is a great song!
2:07 Is that a giga Monty reference? lmao
JUST LIKE WILLIAM AFTON, TLT ALWAYS COMES BACK!!!

Someone knows who made the glamrock bonnie poster???
Hi guys I love your music so much!!
love this
So why aren’t you working for mappa bruh?
Ok I genuinely did not expect Monty to start killing everyone ☕🐐😭
porfin se revela porque glamrock bonnie esta roto 🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Мультик красивый
I didn't expect it
Started so amazing that I didn't even notice it begin the first listen
This was so cool and good
Boa musica, bons modelos, boa animação, boa edição, isso é perfeição
This is super, duper neat. Especially the absolutely top animation. Gotta love it when the Living Tombstone hits you with another masterpiece. 🎭
Good song. As every one.
This Song Is Crazy. I love it❤
THIS IS A BANGER !
Holy moly this is Peak
yo saliendo de mi prepucio para ver una obra maestra 🎁
NEW SONG?!?!??
I love it,
casually drops fnaf song  ok tlt keep cooking wtf lmao
Unbelievably beautiful
Lhola
What an amazing song, and a great characterization for Monty and his actions.
1 hour and became a classic
PEAK AS ALWAYSSSS AAAAAAAA
That storyline tho 🤣 all being monty's sick fever dream was awesome, loved the animation too! The mix of 3d and drawing was a pretty neat mix
LET'S GOOOO
This is fire
1755 th
Man this song is so good and I really wanna enjoy it but I despise Monty and I don't know what to do now
This went from Monty wanting to get the spotlight to Monty's murder fest
I like this really
Goddamn, this song really speaks to Monty's ego... _but this takes it further than the game,_ cause rather than just stop at breaking Bonnie, he chucks Chica, rocked Roxy, and freaked out on Freddy, ending with crushing the poor bear's head... and then it turns out the whole thing was in his head a la Tip the Scales, as foreshadowed by the guitar becoming a golf club when he whacks Chica, minus the fire damage the latter had... kudos, TLT and McGwire!
The little Patpats <3
Rise of Giga Monty goes crazy
WE USED TO PRAY FOR DAYS LIKE THESE! 🗣️🔥
TAXES ☕🐐🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
37 MINUTES AGO!- WOAH
1:02 Suddenly, Mimic
I waited every night for this
The start of song reminds me of the epoch remix, love this one
2:07 in the bottom right is Tenna’s dance
I hate monty
1:03 THE MIMIC IN THE TOP OF THE LEFT CORNER
The animation is so good wtf Also why does the idea of Monty destroying the Pizzaplex out of rage make a better plotline than the one we actually got in ruin-
🐻🐰🐔🦊🐊
2:02 and 2:01 have crazy meme template potential
It's interesting to see how it's a story Ish telling song, thou Monty killing Roxy and Chica for fame isn't canon, but killing Freddy is, but what made me sad is that people, and bots are always willing to take it too far just to get the adrenaline of fame they crave, even killing the ones who wouldn't fight back to keep it. Sadly, I see more of that day by day, especially in the movie productions these days. I understand that Monty was looked down by the fans, but the band didn't. They just loved and knew the guy. This is what happens to people, the difference between a good and bad idol, one who is willing to take the entire competition down to be the number one star, and the other who just wants to make the fans smile. . .
my new song on repeat, still a fnaf fan after all these years and TLT songs of fnaf always hits
RIP Bonnie. A step on the stairwell to stardom.
I dont understand but i think in his dream is when gregory is not here and and he became more selfish and killed everyone
WHY DOES THIS REALEASED WHEN I JUST BOUGHT FNAF SECURITY BREACH
Amazing
Cory Kenshin would NOT like this song 💀
Let’s go! I’m early! Great song btw
This is an absolute banger!
Love this!🖤
Best birthday present, very kewl :3
My fave channel for fnaf songs is back
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOO NEW TLT FNAF BANGER 🎉🎉🎉
The wet floor bots are the most cutest thing ever
Any tombstone song is a BANGER
This is awesome
Meh
Accurate to Monty
Monty the great singer 🐊🐊🐊
Top demais!!!!
YESSSS
MAPPA level animation 🔥🔥🔥
Wow
I love how in this song Monty literally just kind of is an asshole with 0 motivation but jealousy and pride.
This was beautiful
Monty is my favorite character from fnaf, thanks for making him shine as he deserved, even though I know he's a villain, I would have liked them to give him more shine in the game, it's just my opinion. I love the color green and reptiles xd
It's so peak 🥹
glad to be here 30 mins after the release, I'm gonna find my comment in a decade or so and gonna be so nostalgic
THE ANIMATION IS CRAZY
I guess i need to step  on him
OMG THIS IS PEAK btw, it reminds me so much of "daisies" from black gryph0n
Here we go again
Turtle.
ANOTHER DROP
the tombstone LIVESSS!!!
We need an instrumental of this 😭
Peak
I wonder if we’re get a secret of the mimic song❤❤ but I still love this childhood hero’s fnaf songs ❤❤
NEW SONG N WE LOVE IT ALREADY
This is the most random song release of all time and I'm here for it, amazing guys!
YUHHH WE MAKIN IT THROUGH 5 NIGHTS WOT TS ONE 🔥 🙏
ANOTHER FIRE FNAF SONG BY THE LIVING TOMBSTONE!!! But genuinely this song is so good i would never forget about it!!

I hope my fellow Monty haters are around here as well
WHAT, A NEW TLT FNAF SONG DROPPED
Oh my Gooood! The animation, the song, everything is incredible. I loved the song so much, and I love Monty!🗣❤
alternate fnaf sb ending
Monty is the true mc of fnaf
I did not expect Monty killing the three other Glamrocks and the security boys, ngl 😶
went from small group to an small group, unbelievably
Thanks!
cooked in this 🔥🔥🔥
You all did an amazing job on this beautiful piece of art we call step on up!
Yup, definitely: TLT never misses
Its always so funny how extreme violence can completely pass the censors when its targeted toward robots
It premiered on my birthday 😭 (No one congratulated me, but this made up for it)🎉
Hell yeah
The thumbnail looks SICK
Very different kind of FNaF song that I’ve seen, but an instant classic! Absolutely amazing as always Mr. Tombstone!
One of the only music creators that can still make good fnaf music
FINALLY ANOTHER PEAK MUSIC AGAIN
peak
here before this blows up
Que buena cancion sois los mejores
THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE, THE MUSIC, THE GRAPHICS, EVERYHTING IS PERFECT
Legit one of the best living tombstone songs ever (maybe even fnaf or songs in general)
WE NEED MORE FNAF
Wow about every theory they say that Monty wanted to take Bonnie out and replace him but I really like this song because of those who found out that Monty wanted to take Bonnie out and replace him
ALWAYS MAKING THE BEST FNAF SONGS
Tan bueno como siempre 🙌🙌
Uhhhh a song but umm this reminds me of creepypasta
MONTY DIDNT KILL BONNIE IT WAS AFTON
Bonnie on top
2:07 THE MIMIC
Being this early is criminal
Why is fnaf security breach popular now in 2025???
THIS IS SO COOOOOL OH MY GOD WHAT A JAM
Oh btw, this guy gets whooped by a 10 years old kid, just saying
ABSOLUTE BANGER
LETS GOOOO!! ANOTHER PEAK SONG FROM TLT!!
I bet this is somehow cannon
GOD I LOVE MONTY SM 😭🥹💅✋🫶  I love this so much. Monty is my all time favorite. He’s such a diva 💅  The voice fits perfectly
The movements of the animation were PERFECT. The song is so tuff and cool and with a good rithm
i remember when i was little I thought The Living Tombstone was the owners of fnaf 🥀🥀😭😭
Probably the most random TLT song ever   BUT IT’S STILL FIRE 🔥
FELIPE SE LA COME
Now this is my kind of peak!
Banger love the Musik and Sound Animation and effekts are also fire ❤
This song makes me get jiggy with it
Nice song fr

Maybe the real Five Nights were the friends we made along the way
This is hugo levels of animation, its peak.
To think it’s been over 10 years of straight bangers from this guy is insane. I was 12 bro 🥀🥀🥀
ONLY 33 MINS OMG YES
BONNIE ALL DAY BONNIE RAHHHHH I MISS YOU
2:06 Monty on greenscreen: 💅💅💅

This animation is up there with into the spider verse, SO FLUID in it's art style i love it
Love the song and I find it interesting that they went with the rumor that Monty was the one who destroyed Glamrock Bonnie intentionally despite being proven he was being controlled. Some say it was Freddy who destroyed Bonnie
feddy
NEW TLT FNAF SONG⁉️⁉️⁉️
WOW! The animation in this clop is so peak and the song 🤩🤩🤩

The Tombstone is living again

LETS GOOO FIRE
Since Security Breach may not be the fully canon events of what happens before Ruin anymore, I’ll take this as the canon explanation as to how the animatronics got ruined.
=)
Glad to see him still be on this fandom
10/10 You never disappoint TLT I love you
NEW SONG🎉🎉🎉🎉
I've always wanted a Monty song from TLT 🤩
Lets GOOO!! this is now the new Monty song! 💚
AHHH I LOVE IT
You guys KILLED it!!! So freakin good both animation and song
Fire song even tho I hate monty
BONNIE FOR THE WIN !!!!!
Мне в кайф.
This is a incredibe job!
Monty is my 2nd favorite sb character (aside from the daycare attendant) and seeing the smooth animation of him just murdering Bonnie, Chica, Garbage, and Freddy was the coolest thing, I love ut
So that’s how Monty killed Bonnie so that’s cannon
30 minutes
I really like the rockstar bonnie design
30 mins later, im here-
Bonnie over Monty all day my fellas
STEP ON ME *P L E A S E*
If Cory ever sees this it's over 😭
Another banger
Nice that you return to this franchise!  That song was so fantastic! Monty was so OOC in this song and I love it!
banger
Monty content in the big 2025?? Hell fucking yeah
This is a banger 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥
absolute cinema
I hate Monty so much I swear 🙏 this song goes hard tho!!!!!
OMG, i love this song
Cory’s getting mad with this one 🔥🔥🔥
MONTY HATE WILL BE TOLERATED!!!!
Monty could NEVER replace Bonnie in my eyes
1:55 "not here all night" reference
Always good to have a FNAF song with that TLT touch 🔥🔥❤
My research into the invariably complex nature of incorporeal soul matter has lead to a promising discovery. It would seem that souls come in two types. Clear souls, and black souls. Clear souls seem to act as neutral spirits. So far, every single child that has died at my hand has produced a clear, desaturated spirit. These souls are relatively weak, containing little energy when contained within a vessel . . . . . . yet still containing some sort of free will and control of their respective vessels Black souls, on the other hand, appear dark, like shadows. Black souls tend to be self-expressed in hues of purple and black. These souls, from my own observations, tend to manifest from adults. The magnitude of a soul’s power seems to be determined by emotion itself. Children’s souls are weak for this very reason.  Tending to hold onto a few emotions, Fear being the main emotion. Adults, however have a more sophisticated emotional palette. Anger, lust, greed, and even envy could manifest in souls. However, the most interesting emotion of all, in my observations, seems to be regret. Regret directly taints a soul, turning it charred and black. And with the darkened hue, comes considerable power. While spacial manipulation and hauntings usually go hand in hand- Take your common poltergeist for example-  This manipulation is usually only strong enough to raise, or launch, matter. However, since the strength of a soul’s power to manipulate its surroundings is determined by the emotion contained within it. . .  . . . one could argue that if a soul were to contain an intense enough regret, why, it might be able to engage in temporal manipulation. Could a soul reverse time, through a physical manifestation of it’s own regret? Perhaps not. But, should a soul contain an intense, unyielding regret. . . -It may be able to travel between timelines, and indeed, enter the spatial vacuum between timelines. The soul’s ultimate desire to turn back the clock. . . . an interesting thought, but one sadly unrelated to my studies. Time is a merely misunderstood spacial dimension, and the discoveries I aim to make should transcend what we ought to know about space-time relativity. My research continues as normal.
TEMÓN
3:08 Giga Monty reference?
PEAK!!
The animation is so smooth
Good work
THEYRE BACKKKK!!!

LIVING TOMBSTONE WHATTT??? SO COOL
I can see myself coming back to this song in ten years...See you there guys
THIS IS FIREEE🔥🔥🔥
The living tombstone is mostly known for fnaf, but you know what? Their music is so fire.
early gang!
WAIT WHY IS THIS ACTUALLY GOOD also 2:07 is an amazing refrence
After seeing Monty destroying his friends....I wonder who deserves hate... Gregory or Monty?
Well ain't I early
"Step On Up"? More like "Step On Down"!  Said the gator who lost his torso and legs form an orphan child!
WAS THAT A W? nice
you just cant resist making bangers, do you?
I like how this song really expands on Monty as character and it fits him a lot!   Also props to the animation team, its awesome work : )
Ahora si se puede decir que está canción si es canon 🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yet another banger from TLT! This gives massive Disney villian song vibes (In a good way!)
PEAK AHH BANGER
WE STEPPING ON THE GANG WITH THIS ONE!
:0
After all this time, they’ve finally returned!
I love the reference to secret of the mimic's Monty design
Omg I new song, I like your song ♥
I WAS HERE
2:08 Oh my god it's the Tenna dance in the front
WHAT A BANGER OMG
like always the living tombstone came with good songs
❤❤❤❤❤
“Long time ago it was all for a show” -Tlt Freddy
*me when TLT makes a fnaf song after such a long time*: WHAT?? IMPOSSIBLE!!!
27 minutes.
I LOVE THE LIVING TOMBSTONE
WERE BACKK
I wonder if tlt remake f1 the movie theme from hans zimmer?
peak
Oh that's neat stuff
I ALWAYS COME BACK!!! 🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥 as always tlt releasing good songs >:3
The Living Tombstone came back out of no where and Monty rage quitted bc he had to do a song
I can't believe I'm here before 4k views
26 MIN!!!
TLT saco una nueva canción? 🗣Hoy es un gran dia🔥
Acaso... Usaron algo del lore :0        Wow, no puedo creer que gane una insignia por ser uno de los primeros 😅 que epico.
Not  a good song but a great animation
The animation was so dynamic and the renders were beautiful omg!!!
I can't believe Sam and Yoav haven't been included on the official soundtrack of any more than a single game (i'm speaking of "In Sound Mind" ofc). These guys are so good at what they do! 🔥
STEP ON IN STEP ON HIM STEP ON UP!!!
Como siempre nunca decepcionan y siempre crean obras de arte🔥🔥🔥🍂🍃
🖤
Glad monty has a sense of humor in his head
holy shit the guy from the rustage msuic
Okay I understand rendering this all in 4K with the smoke simulations and fancy shaders, but come on, the rendering samples are so low I can literally see the sample jitter. And no, it's not film grain, film grain behaves differently. This just feels so odd for a supposedly high budget video.  Also my old brain cannot keep up with the lyrics at all, but the song itself seemed alright though not as strong as some of TLT's older FNaF songs.
gooooood
Team des français !!!
The animation is so COOL
WE ARE SO BACK
"You can hide, but you can't hide from me" is such a good reference to Monty's voice line "You can hide, but you can't hide" in Security Breach
HEEEEESSSSSS BAAAACCCCKKKKKKK
Didn t expet such a Masterpiece but here i am
A NEW SONG THIS IS ABSOLUTE PEAK
PEAK!!!!
Time for Mr. "Crocodile Rock" to make his official comeback!
Dangit, missed the livestream. Forget about it.  This song is a genuine masterpiece
i love this
Pretty nice :)
He's so cute. I love Monty! Awesome Song! ❤🎸⚡
Definitely going in my Spotify playlist
Es increíble de las mejores que he escuchado
Amazing and instantly catchy with beautiful animation! Monty got the production he (doesn't) deserve
I will not take this propaganda Monty Montgomery gator is innocent. I am telling you he is innocent. He did not murder Bonnie were you there judge were you there to witness exactly so my client is innocent. Dare you say that about Monty? He didn’t murder anybody he’s innocent he just an ambitious little guy sure, he’s the most aggressive out of out of the four but still he’s innocent aggressive people don’t mean that they’re completely bad people
Wow nice I like it🎬
Dang man!
BEST LATE BIRTHDAY GIFT EVER 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
woah, i love this
11 years ago. WILD
HOW DARE YOUTUBE HIDE THIS FROM ME FOR 23 MINUTES also good song
This felt more like TADC than FNAF kind of.. Anyways, this video was just so well made and so cartoony. I didn't expect such a wacky and fun loaded production from y'all, that was just simply amazing.
master peice
GUYS WAKE UP THE LIVING TOMBSTONE HAS RISEN FROM THEIR GRAVE
I living tombstone song of one of my favorite fnaf animatronics!? Yesssirrrrrr!!!
LET'S GOOOOOOO
This sounds like a song from alternate timeline where SB is animated movie akin to Pixar.
Peak?
How long have you listened to this song Multiple times
Sounds like a song The Living Tombstone would do
Honestly I was definitely not expecting a new Fnaf song but dang it’s actually a bop
3K views But 10K likes???
Haven't heard great fnaf song in a while this is fire 🔥
Real good song to be honest
now this this is PEAK 🗣️🗣️🔥🔥
Is the volume of this song a lot lower than other Tombstone songs, or is it just me?
🐻
Amazing song gng
Another banger TLT. In 8 years we will remember this song!
This is fantastic.
Skibidi tombstone
Top 3 TLT songs!!❤❤❤🐊🐊
i mean it’s alright but not nearly on the level of the other songs
The animatronics being sentient enough to straight up have interpersonal drama and kill eachother over it is silly, but I could imagine something like this in some characters official backstory to some extent.  Also, the animation is really good! And the song, of course.
Ilikebeans
The goat🐐🗣🔥🔥🔥
02:07 Yep we llve when u can spawn 100 montys 🙂
YOOOO
LETS GOOOO
This. Is. Perfect!!!! SYMMETRY MY FRIEND

HE ALWAYS COMES BACK
Omg we're so back baby
a nice simple song that explores an animatronics jealousy, and of course it's expertly done!
why did monty kill everyone (in his mind atleast), is he evil?
Just monika more like Just monty
goat
peak asf dude
Monty, you’re ones of my favorites, but you have serious anger issues. I don’t know what to do with you. I guess I Can’t Fix You.
SILKSONG AND A NEW TLT FNAF SONG ? ARE WE IN HEAVEN ?
BACK WITH A BANGERR 🎉🎉
poor animatronics but this beautiful song continues like this!
Such a BANGER, keep up the good work!

This is such a banger
What a banger! You guys always produce the best FNAF songs ever. Keep up the excellent work!  - Righty, Righty but Detology, Dyno
Wait, these guys still make Nerdcore songs? It's been 2 years (not counting the join us for a bite remix)
I like Freddy more than Monty
Dauym ok i see what your doing there
i love how monty leaves behind his banjo before taking out bonnie... it was never about the music
This is HEAT!! 🔥🔥🔥💜
This one was in Intresting 😤
HES BAAAAAAAACK
wake up babe, new tlt fnaf song just dropped 🔥
7 Palabras E S C E N C I A
PEAK
2:06, tenna dance in bottom left
Monty is going on a killing spree
I love the detail that Monty uses a bowling ball to hit Bonny due to him not having his claw upgrade at the time. Not to mention how at 2:06 you can see Monty on the right side hitting the gangdom style
A song about murder.  I hate this animatronic more that the Mimic.
This is so fire
Actually Fire
I'm super early
All I'm saying is Classic Bonnie would not let that slide
Is this about giga monty
There's a reason this gator has had me in a chokehold for the past 4 years.  Really nailed the vibe here, excelent excelent!!
OMG there's a Giga Monty reference at 2:07 ! :D
Well this was a pleasant surprise
NEW FNAF SONG DROPPED LETS GO
YAYYYYYYYYYY NEW MUSIC, BY THE WAY THE LIVING TOMBSTONE PLEASE MAKE 20M+ MORE MUSICS ON FNaF 4 PLS
Didn’t expect this, but it’s an absolute banger
17 mins ago wth
MONTY MY UNJUSTIFIED KING 🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊
very good as always
YOOOO A NEW FNAF SONG FROM TLT!!!!!! IT'S FIRE TOO!!!
Oh my god? I thought this was a random post from like 2 years ago but this is SO new?!
Ты как всегда радуешь музыкой наш дорогой человек  As always, you delight our dear man with your music.
The storytelling about Montgomery Gator is incredibly awesome! 💚
LETSSS GOOOOOOOOO
why is this fire🔥🔥🔥
LET'S GOOOOO THAT'S MY MAN 🔥💥✨
I honestly wasn't expecting a monty song tbh but I do like it a lot!
real
The animation is so expressive and new! But TLT still got that nostalgic beat they bashed in our heads with a bowling ball as kids!
Why i think this is a new popular fnaf song?
🐊❤
Yes
Cory would HATE to see this dude Monty in here
This song made me realize I’ve been listening to your music for over ten years. It’s crazy how much time flies, the nostalgic songs, and the artist development. Can’t wait to see what the future holds!
What a banger!!!!!!
SIMPLESMENTE CINEAM
Monty definitely showed his step on up, in the future he really will be the superstar!
New songgg🎉
WHOAAAATTTTTTT
It's been so long...
Absolu, cinéma, Excellent 🤩🤩🤩🤩
“You can hide but you can’t hide.”
My favorite Fnaf song will always be The Puppet Song duet version
The return!!!!
👍
I LOVE YOU MONTY
16 MINS AGO?? HES BACK!
BABE WAKE UP NEW FNAF SONG JUST DROPPED
WE ARE BACK WITH ANOTHER BANGER LETS GO!!
2:07 Giga Monty is Real! I love the video and song, so catchy.
Was wonderful working on this!!! Such a fun song, hope everyone enjoys
When TLT drops a new FNaF song you know its finna be 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
¡Está increíble! ¡Te amo, TLT! 💛✨
Hell yeah!!!
In his dreams, it's his Montys Mega Pizza Plex.
yay...
Love you guys ❤
CINEMA
Had to watch 2 ads to hear this, but it was worth it
OMFG NOW I NEED A WHOLE GAME DEDICATED TO MONTY CAUSE OF THIS SONG💚💚💚💚💚💚
early gang
there are more likes than people who have viewed the video
The goat finally got a banger focused only on him
Always making great songs 🌟🌟🌟🌟
Tombstone’s still got it.
Already a classic !
I had lost hope of seeing Fnaf music again, but in the end, HE ALWAYS COMES BACK
LETS GO!! MONTY IS GETTING MORE ATTENTION
I hear Monty plans on suing.
I like this for the most part. I still think it's missing the instrumental sections throughout the songs that the earlier songs had, though. Those were my favorite parts.
Yaaay, FNAF songs are back!!!!
animation looks like pixar WTH
NEW FNAF SONG?!
This has such a distinct vibes not just as a fnaf song but most of the living tombstone's contribution so far. I get quite a lot of Disney-ness from it and the fast pase lyrics with the electro swing goes so hard. But I think the animation is probably the best for a Living Tombstone fnaf song ever. It's all so vibrant and flashy which really makes the exergeratted and cartoony  movements pop so much more. So much character is put into the animatronics in every frame. I look forward to rewatching this many times from now on.
the goat has returned!
PLAY THIS AT THE COLUMBUS OHIO CONCERT
Monty is so back
PEAK JUST RELEASED
I love all the montys dancing lmao
Bro just casually drops a Monty murder song and I love it 😭😭
Green with envy
Step on up , or step on MEEEEEE ???🎉🎉🎉❤❤

LETS GOOOO
UNDER 1 HOUR GANG HERE!!!!!!

This has set back Monty appreciation another 5 years. Ugh... Time to get back in the trenches then...
Love this one. So cool to see McGwire moving up. Great work from the BLND-Spot team as well
2:07 gangnam style
There is no alligator at the Mega Pizzaplex. Not anymore.
Don't understand why you make such amazing art for such a bad game
THIS WAS INCREDIBLE, the vocals and animation are just awesome and great vocal and animation work  "❤The Living Tombstone❤"
The animation quality is crazy
SIDERAL
its... peak...
I LOVE THIS SONGGGGG
THIS IS FIRE
wow
GUYS, WE NEED TO CONVINCE YOAV AND SAM TO PREFORM DON'T TATTLE ON ME ON THE TOURS!!!

RIP FREDDY CUH
Thank you the living tombstone  Happy 11 years five nights at freddy's song  Happy 11 years five nights at freddy's  🎉🐻🐰🐥🦊🍕🥳👍
Como amo el diseño de Monty, es precioso. SB tiene un gran estilo, me hubiera gustado ver más sobre la personalidad de cada animatronico en el juego y este video es como un complemento. Que buena animación
Fantastic Job from the Blindspot team!
What the helli, Idk if this is olny for me but there are comments that are 2 days old and this video came out 13min of writing this
Desde los 2084 views y 13 minutos 🗣️
I really enjoyed that video, the animation was amazing and how it went together with the lyrics reminded me of DAISIES by Black Gryph0n & Baasik. Especially starting from 0:57 and onwards.
Musica foda, gostei
LIVING TOMBSTONE DROPPED PEAK as per usual lol
I love it ❤
2:07 Giga Monty be like:
First song ive like by tombstone in a while

I love it!
AMAZING-!!!!!🐊🎸🕶🎶

It was great getting to work on this! The whole team at BLINDSPOT did an insane job!
HOLY PEAK
I was expecting evil Monty but not to THIS LEVEL, this was so brilliantly animated though I couldn’t help but find it fun to watch him killing the whole band. Song bangs and has a lot of variety, outstanding work with the song and to the animation team, this is one of the coolest SB things I’ve seen!!!
Can I get another W?
LOVE THISS
THIS IS NOT A DRILL
The animation was fantastic. The song itself... not really my vibe honestly, but still high quality. Great job, keep up the good work!
That was so 🔥 🔥 🔥  LOVE MONTY💚 🔥
OMG TLT FNAF SONG DROP, ITS BEEN SO LONG LEST GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Legit an instant classic in my opinion
Amazing
Que increíble cancionnn 🤩🫶🏼🫶🏼
This was an awesome song! Vocals, Lyrics, Story, Visuals, it’s all amazing! Another great song!
0:21 STEP ON ME :3
Look, I won't even lie, TLT never fails to dissapoint. So cool how this song sounded, no because, it was honestly great.
So Monty going full Gregory and killing his costars is NOT what I was expecting... But I LOVE THE SONG AND STORY OMGGG
Yooo this is fire!!! Happy 11 years to fnaf💚💜
SIX MINS AFTER POSTING!?????????????????????
IT'S BEEN SO LONG. WE MISS YOU. LOVE THIS NEW SONG
Oh Monty will step up on it alright. *Just not on his legs.*
Definitivamente, es Música 🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. Necesitamos una canción de Mimic. 🥰🥰🥰🥰
My dream has come true and I could not be happier
God, my brain, man. I read the title as "step on me" for a second. What the hell is wrong me? XD
Another of the best fnaf songs and animations I've seen this year, without a doubt the work here doesn't make any sense, it's spectacular, great, phenomenal, everything you want, great work 🔥🔥
yeahhhhhh
I enjoyed this! Y'all haven't done a FNAF song in forever!!
Hey, little guy!
Wow, that’s not bad
DAMN, THIS SONG IS GOOD JEEZ, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK LIVING TOMBSTONE
hold on 6mins ago is crazy
OMG IM EARLY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Omg 5 minutes ago!!!
never i see nothing like that it ✨WONDERFULL✨
Niceeeeee
Did I just experience peak so early?
YAY
This is fire🔥🔥🔥🔥
My headphone is broken rn, i can only hear the music and no lyrics. Remind me later when i buy a new headphone. Awesome music tho
Peak  but wow..Monty is a piece of shit lmao
certified BANGER
Monty kill everything after Glamorock Bonnie. He is so crazy.
Monty saying he wants freddy as a friend but he needs to get out of his way was really scary tbh
I love the musical vibe. Its like a bonus song in a fnaf album
THAT WAS!!! Alright, sadly I don’t wanna be mean but that my less favorite FNAF song from TLT and if I was to rank all of them it would go to the lowest… You still did great, im not saying it’s bad, Keep going and don’t give up im just sharing my opinion on the song.
We're gonna step on up with this one 🗣️🔥🔥🔥
This was amazing!
Peak
🐊 be the animatronic behind the slaughter
Amazing!

MONTY????
It sounds sooo good 🫶

Didn't think a song about Monty would be able to be this fire
YESSS
the video is actually so fun to watch i love the mix of 3d ananation and 2d graphics
I was here
so worth the wait
That Song was Great Tombstone. Hope you’ll do well with FNAf, but I’m also hoping you branch out outside FNAF cause that’s some good talent right here
randomly just got this  recommended
AMAZING! I LOVE IT!
The flow of the animation was amazing! The song has a very fun sway to that’s just so addicting. Amazing job!
Let's GO!
IT WAS PEAK JUST PEAK

I like how this FNAF song has a completely different vibe to the rest of your other FNAF songs and instead sounds more like your original songs, I like it!
I wonder if the part of him killing Bonnie will be Canon

YAAAAAAAAASSS
It's starting
ITS COMMING
I love this ❤❤❤
HERE WE GOOOO
STEP ON UP!!! 🗣️🔥🔥🔥
here it comes
I joked around saying we finally got a Rust-era FNaF song seeing that Sam is in vocal credits, but I didn’t think it would TRULY be a *Rust-era* FNaF song.  I’m sure it’ll still be a bop though.  Edit: Hell yeah, it was a bop. Tempo of the verse segments reminded me a little of Alastor’s Game. Also, what an animation!!? BLND SPOT did some fantastic work with NateWantsToBattle’s own content, and this is no exception! I hope they get to do more with TLT in the future.
Let's gooo❤
FNAF MUSIC SUPREMACY🗣️
🐊
TLT we want some Deltarune
1 minute remaining
This exists Ig, never really been into their Fnaf songs, but cool.
Oh cmon
モンティがカッコイイんよ 最高！！
MONTYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAA🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊
I genuinely love how cheery and goofy the song is while casually showing Monty committing several acts of cold blooded robotic murder. BLIND-SP0T absolutely killed it with this peak animation. All the animators involved should be extremely proud of themselves.
Its so 🐊
So happy to be amongst the first 1000 people watching this!
I can't wait
Ayo you are actually uploading this right as I’m finishing my doc cosplay
I'm so happy!
Such a fun song and probably one of my favorite FNAF music videos I've ever seen and I am so proud and honored to have worked on it alongside so many amazing talented people at BLIND_SP0T. 🐊
TLT never stopped making bangers, but it's always a happy day when they return to FNAF ❤️🤩
Just like Scott, TLT can't seem to stop making FNAF content
WHOOP WHOOP NEW SONGGGGG

It comes from the inside when I say I’ve got no time to wait for this premier and I’m so excited - i cant fix my chair when I fall of it. With that being said it’s time to step on up!

Most random song announcement
YIPPIE
This music is good🔥
Yoooo fnaffff
A new FNaF song that’s about Montgomery “Monty” Gator by the legendary The Living Tombstone. Which the four-word cycle of FNaF songs by The Living Tombstone seems to have come to an end. Which every FNaF song by The Living Tombstone before this have four-word titles. Five Nights at Freddy’s  It’s Been So Long  Die In a Fire I Got No Time I Can’t Fix You  This Comes From Inside
He iss come back!!!!
Peak and love this 🔥
Who brought The Living Tombstone’s FNAF Songs to come back to life?! It’s rising back up fr! 🔥🔥
Hello, could you say hello to me please?
The way I giggled and kixked my feet,this is my claim before rhe premiere!!!

Неожиданно

🎶💀 "F*** it's you I hate the most"🎶💀

AAAA IM SO EXCITED
Love you guyssss❤❤❤i can't wait for the song
HELL YEAH
It's now time for our FEATURE presentation  FEATCHER
Ola amikos
Nice to know that TLT is making another FNaF song. And it's about Monty too, nice to see him get some love!  Edit: just listened, the song is really good! I like how upbeat it is, despite the clear sense of malice in the lyrics, similar to Alastor's Game. I interpret it as Monty not seeming to realise how messed up the things he's willing to commit are, simply viewing them as necessary to reach his path to fame and stardom.
Yo i dint know he did a new video
LETS GOOOOO
Thank you for making another fnaf song.
Why not mimic song?
wow your videos in especial This comes from inside☢
Pls
Maybe you're mean :"never gonna give you up"
Ball
Is this like a monty song?

MY BOY!!
NEW TLT FNAF SONG AAAAAAH
WOW:000
I found something out recently about tlt history that really surprised me. In an old souce mod, one of the playtester in the credits is named as yoav "the living tombstone" Landau. At first I was like 'oh, cool' then realised that the creator of portal flash version knew someone called yoav, who was involved in the project. Then I realised that the 2 developers were in fact the same guy!
THE LIVING TOMBSTONE ALWAYS COME BACK HAHAH- Yoav, bro, ur a cool guy
HELL YEAH
Where is that master piece from 10 years ago
Monty thinks he Scott Pilgrim
W Song Like Always :D!!!
Se viene cine

What would be of living thombstone without fnaf?
MONTY NATION WE ARE SO BACK
whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
I’m so confused, I’ve not looked at fnaf for a while but, is security breach still relevant enough to get a song now?
A new FNAF song by The Living Tombstone this about to get PEAK
I think the song will go:           🎶 we're waiting every night to STEP ON UP we were taught to listen to our Masters mind  OOoooh LISTEN UP we tried to kill our Master in different ways but he just keeps coming BACK!! 🎶
We get fnaf songs forever

It's fascinating to remember how Yoav in a stream mentioned that he wanted to do a song about Monty and wonderful to see that it's a complete reality!💚💜  After this I hope to see more FNaF Songs from the other games🙏🏼
There's no way they made a FNAF songs comeback, but a new FNAF song! I am so excited, and ready for FREDDY! 🐻🎤
ALRIGHT GUYS SET YOUR ALARMS
"Why would we stay five nights at freddy's? and why there's security breach?"      The living peak returns

YAYAYAY MONTY MY CHILD
ABSOLUTE CINEMA 🔥🔥🔥
THE LIVING TOMBSTONE COOKING AGAIN 🍳🔥
Love that this is keeping the Rust thumbnail style!
¡New music! 🎉
Interesting another Security Breach song or perhaps a secret of the mimic one in disguise.
I didn't expect to see a new Fnaf song after This Comes From Inside, I was really happy to see this! ❤
Most random song announcement of all time genuinely edit: listened, absolute cinema 🥹
The four-word cycle has ended  Every FNAF song before this had 4-word titles  Five nights at freddy's   It's been so long  Die in a fire  I got no time  I can't fix you  This comes from inside
This gonna be sick 🔥
