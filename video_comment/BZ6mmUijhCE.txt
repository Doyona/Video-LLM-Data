Am I the only one who went over to skill's channel to check the intro to see if he used it
Dude he went hard r on that pl*nke*
I was today years old when I realised the tab list with everyone’s names is in alphabetical order…
I finished last life before I watched this why does no one ware helmets?
They're group name should have been the bridgiots 😆 omg i love the insults part
42:45 Had me dying😂😂😂
42:46 Excuse me Jimmy!?!?
Grian being so viscerally and seriously offended by the car is genuinely hilarious
The La-li-Lu-le-Lo
Spanners span bridges yeah but lol you guys also span over  a variety of groups titles😅😂
Me when furnace give strength 💀 and he didnt use it dominate them because hes to kind 🥲
16:39 “you will never feel that high again” 22:00 *starts smoking and gets ‘high’
42:45 thats.. nice.
How does he have a mob egg in 33:37
Every time Mumbo says “this might be our best build” after they invented Amazon in Minecraft…
Speaking of sub one brain cells, I have less than sub one brain cells. I have sub two brain cells!
Skizz hyping up Bdubs at the start 🥹🥹🥹
13:22 GRIAN PROGNOSTICTED (predicted) PAST LIFE!!!???
I’m the newest comment
"EAT THE SKULK VEIN! NO DON'T PLACE IT!" might be my favourite quote of the episode.
42:45... I'm still waiting to understand the intended context! 😅
Mumbo car line 41:16
23:18   Mumbo just standing eating nonstop in the one spot is killing me
39:10 oh no admin abuse ban him
Graham, not realizing the furnace gave him strength😂
"okay I have a little tool here, let me just... /-B-A-N..."
25:25 "PHILZA, LOOK OUT!!!" -Technoblade
Grian saying that he is a kidded  out sugarplum fairy boy had me laughing so hard 😂😂😂
No one caught at Mumbos pun killed me it was so good! "If you had died again you'd be dis-spand" killed me
Forgot the bread bridge?
Blows up Tango with mind
13:21 teh he foreshadowing
"I can eat my seeds!" 🤨
Mumbo and grian is the best combo I was grinning the whole way through
What's funny about spanners and "bridges span things" that just what they do what am I missing
I'm sorry eat your what tango
Mumbo saying "the spanners" was the most British thing I have ever heard
The fact that the thumbnail is literally grian eating a diamond chest plate will never not be funny
grian typing "/ban" is sending me
You gotta get judelow on one of the series
i cant stop replaying jimmy saying btw if you eat my balls and then grains laugh its to good
grians laugh is crazy after what jimmy said is amazing
Spawn egg
Where did he get the spawn egg
Sub one forever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can we talk about the spawn egg
1944 Netherlands simulator:
19:24 when you can’t even say my name
I would like to point out the hilarity of people running up and yelling, "Don't eat the ___!"
13:22 that’s some unintentional foreshadowing for past life
35:01 what did scar say? or am i tweaking
12:20 bro that reminded me of that one scene in chronicle where the three learned to fly
42:45 not grian howling bro
41:15 mumbo not wanting to be mean😭😭
Is there another fan of Real Civil Engineer? With all those bridges, you should've called yourselves the Engineers.
24:27 pov child when parents are fighting
1:08  well if u meet me that will change
42:44  [Jimmy]Hey By the way,if you eat my balls -No I mean   [Grian] [Laughter]
26:26 the dripstone fills him up, i guess
13:25 skeleton spawn egg?
I love how you can tell where people have been for the past while by their food choice in this episode. the ones lower down tend to eat more stone-based things, which they have more of and are more likely to discover, and people on the top of the mountain are having things like dirt or leaves.
You should be called the brigde builders
when you were making the bridge and said "i don't think iv'e ever made a bigger bridge" i immediately thought of bread bridge.
19:44  "Well, İ took off my clothes!" "İ would put them back on, mate."
wild life is the most non pg ever....cant wait for this new life season ,bet ya all a dollar it wont even be pg
big backs assemble should be the title.
0:33 last life mentioned😢
Bros finding 7 diamond veins while I can’t find a vein with  more than 1.
42:46 LMFAO JIMMY
Why is nobody talking about what martin said...
... mysirnameisjumbo ...
I love that they didn't realize the food tab was the suspicious stews
The car just being in Grian’s view is actually hilarious. This series is not serious at all😂😭
I've actually never watched a Minecraft series, this was my first and I'd say i like it quite allot.
“I ate my old stuff” has gotta be one of the funniest sentences I have ever heard 😂😂😂😂
Jimmy: hey by the way if you eat my balls   Grian:*  dying of laughter*  Me: *shocked at what jimmy said*
it looks like an E
I quite love the Sub-One Club.
WHY HAS GRIAN HAD SO MANY CHEESE DREAMS IM worried
2x speed for anyone else
15:17 THE INTENSITY OF HOW HE SAID "EAT" MADE ME WHEEZE
45:57 Oh trust me mumbo it's going to get you so high you won't wanna come down
42:44 GIGGLED
“That is one fully kitted out sugarplum fairy boy”🤣🤣got me rolling on the floor
You had bad boys, what about… bridge boys
That was one grazy clutch Skizz did
Bridges… they span things
When he says “that is one sugarplum fairy boy” it my me die laughing 😂🤣
HELP i love all the mumbo/ noises moments with the food noise mentions 5:39  5:54  11:08 13:18 14:08  17:51  36:32
35:20  Chill with the bridges G xD ever since bread bridge really?
50:30 should've been "Broken bridges break hearts"
Shugar plum fairey!!!
There's a spawn egg in grian's inventory
I looked it up and calling someone a spanner or plonker is essentially calling them a dumb***
Why do you have a mob spawn egg?
Skizzes dumb tri ks😅😂❤
18:00 dont mind me
35:21 Grian: I cant think of a base that has had this much bridge *Bread bridge flashbacks* 🥲
21:30 Human greed
How did he get a spawn egg? 42:49
You should have to play a minigame when you hit a random button (its diffrent for everyone)
He was about to ban someone at 54:18
Pici Pici Lamanichi
Anyone notice he had a skeleton spawn egg at 33:58
the car is dom's car from fast and furious
"If you eat my balls- no-" -Jimmy Solidarity, 2024 "Gladly?" -Jumbo Mumbo, 2024
28:00 DIAMOND ARMOUR FULL SET
Mom mode grian
This is a really funny series to watch in 2x speed
Name idea: The mile high club
5:10 is that a spawn egg? lmao
28:42 iron leggings are the best, do you have ANY IDEA WHAT INSTANT HEALTH DOES WITH 5 SECONDS?!?!?
42:45?????? "by the way if u eat my balls" belongs in an ooc compiliation
this guy just likes bridges, first in limited kife, he made bread BRIDGE, in secret life, he made the egg thingy, surrounded with BRIDGES, now this??? Im calling it, the 7th series will be bridged life
Someone agree with me that this trio reminds me of the outsiders brothers Darrel, Sodapop and Ponyboy
What about the freeloaders
every grian minecraft episode is a mix between a fever dream and a coxy play through. there is no in between.
The whole reason why mumbo died to hunger at first and in the bonus clip is because when you have no hunger bars, it will drop your health to half a heart, but that's if you don't move. If you move you will die. In the bonus clip if you slow it down you can see mumbo start to move right before he dies.
How did grian get a spawn egg...
We need the goofy guy like scar in every Minecraft server/SMP
32:37 pov me and my brother arguing on what to have for dinner
If you look up chobblesome its a real word now!
19:45 SKIZZ PUT YOUR CLOTHES BACK ON!!!!!
I have never laughed so much at people starving
so far I like the last series a lot better, I don't see how these wildcards relate to the premise of everyone
34:17 the random person falling out of the sky?!
as you eat the chestplate, me just whimpering
Yes, I looked it up and all those insults are real insults 😂
Bread Bridge 🫡
6:35 “how’d that happen” most accurate sentence in mincraft
26:19 Spawn egg?
That’s the fast and furious car!
42:51 WHAT
pica simulator
I love how the recap in like 5 seconds long.  Lol
I almost eat my seed-mumbo
I didn’t think u could eat everything 😅
they came up with thier own name demise
how about the sub one brain cell club
same with the other two
skizz has sub one brain cell
It's four in the morning and I'm baking cookies.. What am I doing- I should be sleeping! But im waching G, so its okay!
Help, I'm waching this at 03: 29 wile baking cookies and I keep getting jumpscared by the sounds!!!-
A spanner is a Tool guys. I don't know if you use the word Tool (aka: idiot) as an insult in the UK or US but here in Australia, we do.
I love the idea of coming up with a group name, but it's always based on the wildcard, so you have to change it every episode. That has a certain... sub 1 energy that's a riot.
39:10 "/ban"
Imagine this wild card on last life. Mumbo would eat all the spy glasses jim gave him
Mumbo: I’m at half Grian: find real food! Also grian: has real food and doesn’t give
Grian don't worry Its not your fault mumbo died. There is only so much we can manage on our own. It's not your job to keep everyone alive so don't beat yourself up about it.
I disliked my own c9mment
Whach in the final episode groan is about to win then the enderman from this episode kills him 😂
"cuz broken bridges don't bridge" -mumbo 2024
at 34:17 you can see someone falling in the backround
The sword is just Wild life Ep 2 🙏
whats the world seed
"I am mature I am mature I am mature I am- " *floaters*  "BAHHAHAHAHAHAHA"
for the love of god organize that hellish inventory
BRIDGE, BRIDGE, BRIDGE, BRIDGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SUGAR-PLUM-FAIRY!!!!😃
grians making me so anxiuse watching him almost eat the diamond chestplate. like: WHY GRIAN.
You're hotbar is driving me insane
47:35 Why does Grian have a spawn egg?! Did I miss something?
noICe
grian babysitting everyone has me dying
grian babysitting everyone has me dying
Bridge Boys!!!!!
I laughed so hard at 39:10 😂😂
40:10 40:18
42:45 100% in the out of context video
2:31 spawn egg in inventory
21:45 why does grian have a skeleton spawn egg
All in all a one hundred percent successful trip!  - but Sir we lost Mr Skizz All in all a one hundred percent successful trip
Hi I liked the video but i think you should have called your little boys gang the widdle bubbas. have a nice day :)
i GOTTA know how those NBTs were rigged to auto stack. it would save so many mod devs
Wow Mr jumbo
33:30 😂😂
The guy just floating by the tower in the background is hilarious at 8:07.
10:54
8:08 InTheLittleWood Just floating up in the background had me rolling for some reason XD
34:18 was probably skizz falling
I like the car :(
28:57 anyone notice the spawn egg???
45:25 or you could say he'd........    be dis-"spanned"
"What I just ate my seeds!?"  - Mumbo Jumbo 2024
Letting the man who tried calling their team the axis in one season name your team this season ain’t the brightest of ideas now isn’t it.
41:12
If you didn't know Spanner means Wrench and Plonker means Inept or Foolish.
I love how grian fidnt realize how good iron boots were. Literally resistance 4 is so broken.
Or, we could ~floatsie woatsie~
Just catching up now and I’m so glad I decided to watch this lol, this is just as amazing as the other seasons of the Life Series :3
could’ve been the mile high club
35:25 right... definitely not bread bridge
MOM AND DAD ARE FIGHTING IM GOING TO FLOAT AWAY
Man I need to try this out in Minecraft now. I’ll figure it out. Hopefully. Actually does anyone have the command block for this? Or is this a mod?
25:10 how does bro have a spawn egg 😭😭
Ep. 1: “we got a few listeners” Ep. 2: “It’s like being in Minecraft beta” THE LORE
Skizz screaming as he plummets out of the sky will never get old
1:13 that "right" was perfectly delivered xd
8:12 its just hilarious while skizz starves to death Etho is just floating away in the background
i would eat slime and sand
i love The Boys reference
this hunger wildcard is very chobblesome
I have absolutely no idea what is going on 😂
skizz being worse than jimmy be like
26:20 what
Skizz’s scream fading in and out as he fell in 15:19 had me dying
39:09 “I can type /B… A… N…”
why is there a skeleton spawn egg in grians inventory?
What a WILD video
32:30 _"Why are you so keen for floaters to stick?!"_ has to be the worst line in this video... 😹
35:23 BREAD BRIDGE GRIAN
25:44   Grian: "and a music disc..."  Me: *DSMP Flashbacks*
Have they forgotten about limited life? 35:22 The bad boys bread, bridge and also how eager is he to escape the egg? What about secret life?
a wildcard could be that every food is like a sus stew and you get a random new effect every time you eat something new
Your team could have been.... "The Crack Friends" cause you're building in a crack.
17:23 ahhh yes “a stone shovel is always blind” -grian 2024
How did groan get a mob egg
40:21 NO JIMMY NO
Puts a new meaning to "eat dirt".
30:12 grian has a spawn egg???!
They're a bridge crew  Journey before destination  Bridge 4!
them having to change their name every session...
The only wild card not in the finale… 😢
“I’m in so hard already” -Grian, 2024
Best part is that base doesn't have a back
Free my boy phantom blood dio, he aint do nun wrong
Why does he have a spawn egg
as unique as the names are, better than the time he went and thought "the axis" was a cool name
you carring your entire inventory with you is pmo
You could be called the bridge boys maybe?
hell yeah, bunkbridge
mumbo about to die and grian telling him to calm down becasue its stressing HIM out is the most grian and mumbo interraction to ever happen
"cause broken bridges don't bridge" - Mumbo  Truer words have never been spoken. slap it on a t-shirt!!!
Ok actually what is a spanner and a plonker?
Grian the type to take bribes for info 😭😂
At least grian doesn’t have to do a back for this base
Grian without context: 'the real risk in this one is eating your sword.'
Grian betrayed Mumbo unintentionally
42:45 I want the stamp too this is way toooooo funny to not to save😂😂😂 So everything I get a notif im laughing my azz off again
Funny you should ask, my diamonds are right here.
42:45 LOOOOOL, That’s going in the out of context 100% 😂😂
Why did grian have a spawn egg at 42:50
Idea for a wild card: killing someone has a 1/3 chance of adding a life to their count, and a 1/2 chance of giving you a life
Today was the rise of bridge boys
THIS HAS SO MUCH ANIMATIC VALUE! THE DRAMATIZATION WE COULD DO! MOB BOSS GRIAN 39:03 "Who?" *slow head turn* I AM LOVING THIS EPISODE
Declare war on the car.
THIS IS LITTERALLY THE SAME SEED AS MY SURVIVAL WORLD!!! I have a robot-themed base inside the hill and my friend's farm/orchard base is above it.
⚠️⚠️I have an idea!! What If you combine hot potato with tag You have a timelimit to give another player an item (example:potato) and if you don't give that person the item something bad happens. But the other people don't know what that item is or it changes like what happened in this eposide!!
Love this series
0:02 get out loll
0.02 get out
grian realize he needs to get bucket of water quick so he mines, proceds to spend half o the episode with an empty bucket
42:45 balls scene 😇
42:45 Timmy-“hey by the way if you eat my balls…” Grian-“🧙HahHahHaahhAhaHahHaHehheheehHe!”
34:16 the random person flying down
32:30 it could be the “bridge boys”
We could walk or we could floatsi Wolsi😂
42:44 CLIPP OF THE SEASONN!!!😭🙏🙏
2:46 "are we A-GRIAN!!!???!!??"
43:10 "lovely set of balls" HELLLOOO????😭😂💀💀💀💀
42:55 "gladly" LMFAO????????
It reminds me of bread bridge 44:32
8:04 *lego yoda death noise*
43:00 is crazy 🤣
My daughter loves your videos
The food situation just stressed me out so much this episode. Thank you for all the content!
42:46
43:19 the top two are- top twoah- TALK TUAH???
22:32, 24:47, 42:44, 53:19
just a funny fyi a "Spanner" in german is a peeping tom
33:30
30:30
36:31 When did Grian get a Spawn egg?
34:05  Grain: "dude perfect"   Mumbo: *goes for bridge trickshot
What is it with Mumbo and names only based on the gimmick
This wild card essentially made them all Upchuck from Ben 10
Ah yes, the dungeon meshi wild card
they sorta be spanners now, but they still have sub 1 intelligence
I could just imagine Scar just eating half of the enchantment tables if this was in the first session😅
Get in the water? Epic reference???
Did u notice that the bridges looked like mumbos face 😂
I got a stomach ache just by watching them eat these things
“Let’s eat dirt, and make our way up the mountain” - Grian 2024
"Something about this dripstone, it's filling me up ☠️"
8:01 so so so funny
"Why are they building a car?"  It's Secret Life Season 2.
39:10 /ban 💀
A good idea for a wildcard is there’s a 50% chance when you jump to go to build limit and a 50% chance when you crutched go all the way to bedrock
42:45 “And by the way, If you eat my balls.. WAIT” “Ok” “Of course!”
I think that the wild cards are overshadowing the series premise which is why people are getting distracted and why it feels like a creative world. i dont think thats a bad thing! this all feels like a fun series to me
Grian passing the sugar to Mumbo to get down at 45:28 made me think of a certain substance iykwim
28:41 grian, your axe 😔😔😔
0:00 - Introduction 2:56 - Wild Card 8:42 - Floaters 16:48 - Woodcutting 20:39 - Plot twist 25:01 - The mines 29:16 - Bridgerton 35:45 - Randomize 37:33 - MURDER! 41:06 - Revenge plot (42:45 ...Jimmy SolidarityGaming, what the HECK did you just say?!) 44:54 - Base time 49:17 - Conclusion 52:39 - Bonus clip: admins don't mesh with regular players, it seems
In 34:04 mumbo actually did a dude perfect 👌 he fell and survived
53:20 that is tragic lol
why am i concernd when grian is panicen
I want another “aha” session with mining for diamonds.
42:46 We caught Grian dirty minded
33:29 out of context
Grian’s shoulders must have hurt like gobbitz after recording this!
The way that the vibes of 33:47 completely gave away the fact that he was gone fall. Idk how. I just knew. I swear Grians fall clips have a certain anticipation to them.
Grian member your birch bridge monstrosity
31:30 My heart:📈📈📈📈📉📈📉📈
Floating and dropping in the crop field was pro
the next grian out of context is going to be amazing
I think the: Oh the sugar plum fairy! is gonna become the new: well pluck my nose hair and send me to alaska
34:06 dude perfect mentioned
"hey, btw if you eat my balls..." -jimmy 2024
39:02 it was a murder  grian: who tango also grian: /ban
42:45 I’m crying of laughter
I just noticed that mumbo has the waffle in this video 🤣
13:25 was that a spawn egg...
"Of"
The bridges or saftey
Here is a wild card you should add. every 5 minutes a random mob spawns on every single player
did no body realize that Grian had a spawn egg?
43:19 TOP TUAH
Boys 👏 we’re 👏 going 👏 mining 👏
Imagine the Minecraft characters stomachs after this
33:25  no context 😂
32: 20. . . And that was the day the Bridge Brothers were born. . .
13:24 ...Why is there a skeleton spawn egg there? Where did that come from???
Lads maybe don't name yourselfs the spanners
42:22 im crying💀🙏
basically half of r/pheonixSC
48:11 “the car is really taking me”
Grian laughing HAHEAHEEEHEAAEEHEEEE
not me laughing at Skizz saying "I don't wanna eat my pick" 😭😭 (pick/pikk is slang for peepee in norwegian)
Bread bridge is better
42:53 Grians laugh is funnier than the actual joke
Bad Boys Bread Bridge would argue it is a bigger and badder bridge life!
Bridges... bridges... bridges...BREAD BRIDGES?!?!??!?!?!??!?!??!?!?!?
How did he get a mob egg
42:45  @solidaritygaming   🤣🤣🤣🤣 PG man
8:38  "a decent source of food thats not going to kill us" says him gulping a tuff wall
42:45  *sneeze*
I love how silly the skizz is! Hes so funny!
Actualy the bad boys bread bridge has the biggest bridge to base radius
broken bridges dont bridge                                     - jumbo mumbo 2024 -
their name is sub 1, so is their iq
Mumbai needs to make a button to please Grian
16:44 "You will NEVER feel that high again" I love this quote lol
“I can’t think of a base in third life that has this much bridge” it wasn’t third life but grian made the egg the previous series
All this ‘plus one’ and ‘sub-one intelligence sounds a lot like Newspeak from 1984… And to think of it, the sub-one club is KIND OF developing into a cult.
Genuinely hilarious being a us citizen and being as ignorant as Skizz the whole episode until Mumbo and Grian dropped that spanner was an insult I thought they were trolling but it is LMAO
Broken bridges give you stitches😂
The fact that mumbo said this build was better than grains mansions.
Taking ownership of the mistake of letting him starve is really cool of you, honestly. Mad respect for it
42:55 _gladly_?? 🤣🤣🤣
8:07 etho just levitating in the air in the corner 😆
mumbo saying "my deepslate's so good" got me hahahaha 😂😂😂😂 11:18
why egg 18:04 also good vids also your are my fav youtuber
28:51
I think I might be cooking with this one: 3 lives Everyone is green no matter what life they're on There is a secret boogie man that can remain boogeyman for the entire season as long as they don't loose a life. If the boogey looses a life, a new boogeyman is immediately selected at random. Green players can kill the boogeyman for rewards, but if they kill a non-boogey, the person killed does not loose a life, but the one who killed the wrong person does. If no one has died by the hands of a boogie that session, the current boogie will get a random debuff for the next session ONLY.  Welcome to Traitorous Life  P.S. Before anyone comments this, yes I just turned the life series into among us
anyone notice at 13;30 grian has a spawn egg?
"oh by the way if you eat my balls" Jimmy, 2024
43:22 was that a hawk tuah reference?
Skizz bruh that’s a seriously well done trick. Sub 1 intelligence gang!
“That’s like being in Minecraft Beta” wow that took me back to Evo. Guess I gotta rewatch the series
15:16  Grian: "Where did everyone go?" Skizz: *Screaming in terror as he falls*   Grian: "EAAAAT!!!!" *As Skizz falls*
Probably the most I’ve laughed at any life series episode
16:09 skizz awesome +2 placing and eating dirt clutch
When they said "Let's drop in on our neighbors" holding suger, I realy thought they meant bird-poop
Didnt like the reroll
42:49 You know that’s going in the out of context video
even though third life was the og, last life was truely the og in all of our hearts
This base doesn't have the most bridge! Bread Bridge does!
4:49 terrible timing for mumbo out of context
I love how irrationally mad Grian got at the existence of that car
42:45 this is making into a compilation for sure lol
Sub 1 still works, sub 1 size, sub 1 mining speed
"Tango was blown up by a creeper" *Cheers* 😂😂😂
they should have this in minecraft
It would be cool if every session there group name changes to fit the wild card
The shriek of terror from Skizz at 15:16 was so funny, jesus wept 😂
Y’all might want to visit a doctor after all that “food” you ate… 😅  Turns out eating healthy was a devastating difficulty for everyone… 😂
A good wild card would be that everybody slowly levitates and goes down by crouching
I NEED these datapacks
A wildcard should be every once in a while when you jump it breaks the block under you
When they were talking about records and bridges, my first thought was "Nothing tops Bread Bridge"
Grian: It’s like being in Minecraft Beta *flashbacks to Evo* 13:20
42:25 Nah Jimmys gone crazyy 💀💀 that was too funny man  This episode has to be the best so far 😭😭
At 36:16, the bridge is NOT ONLY and ‘S’ but can also represent the three pals: the top stone bridge for mumbo, the oak bridge for grian and the spruce one for skizzly 😂😂
Big Bridge Base Build Bros..... Or, the BBBBBros.
42:46  WHAT JIMMY??
42:46 WHAT?!
31:10 The first time I have ever heard someone eat their old armour.
I can't stand your inventory
16:08
nomnom
BRIDGE BASE
Anykne else notice when mumbo gets upset he has a thicker accent, when hes happy with or exited about something he uses more britsh words
42:44 WhAt  (Edit: “gladly” 😭)
36:17 to me it looks like a 2
26:20 how did he get that spawn egg?
Why is their a monster egg in my boy grains invitory
42:44 has been clipped...
50:01 WHAT DID HE SAY AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN
42:43 😂😂😂
grian you should make a series were each wildcard stays for the WHOLE series
Get the bogeyman back
35:26 don’t forget about bad boy bread bridge
Did anyone else realize someone falling from the sky at 34:15 😭😭
I dub thee the pica episode.
sub one floaters!!! 🤣
would've been so fun if you just ATE mumbo's diamond
Did grian forget about the bread bridge
Bridge 👍
Polished deepsteack
Jimmy: "Btw if you eat my balls- I mean..."  Grian: *CRAZED LAUGHTER*
18:56 "THE FLOATERS" 💀💀💀
Thank you for the new series!!! Needed this!
Is keep inventory on?
the levitation but hitting ground gives interesting effect. if you take fall damage while under effect of levitation, you get bounced up.
42:45”Hey by the way if you eat my balls”
built 1 bridge for every death
its a shame they didnt become the bridge boys 2.0
42:45 jimmy- if you eat my balls- wait...  Mumbo-.... i bet😅
47:11 hello quagmire xD
At 4:48 if you take it out of contex can be very bad
on the last episode/finale you should have multiple wildcards active!!
I have a wild card suggestion on the final episode all the previous wildcards could be combined
ok bridge boys
Grian: I'm goanna get just ONE bucket   He comes back with full diamond armor.
Brewing stand and they’ll be the Brew Spanners
Gonna see what skizzes intro looks like
Mumbo swore
sub 1 x 10^2
First name: Mumbo. Last Name: Jumbo. First name: Grian. Last name: Grian. First name: Skizz. Last name: Le Man.
Does Grian know what chasing the dragon means?
The animated shorts that will come from this series will be plentiful.
42:49 “BYW if you eat my balls” 😂😂😂
It's only episode 2 and Jimmy and Martyn are already going to be *eating well* when the out of context compilations start coming out
Previously on Wild Life: "GET OUT YOU BIG OAF"
😊😊😊😊😊😊
33:30
Red dwarf quote?
This was a hilarious wild card!! Was laughing the entire time lmao. Can't wait for more chaosit fun
26:24 "I don't know what it is but something about this dripstone filling me right up." -Grian 2024
I agree
Grian should walk around the server wearing a zoo caretaker outfit, and make a “wildlife” documentary
what happened to hermitcraft :,(
wildcard idea: when you place blocks they randomize into random blocks so that could be fun when base building
42:20 you should have broken the rails and placed dripstone
I can eat my pickaxe is crazy
34:06 say that again
Alternate title: pica simulator
Day 36 of asking Grian to bring back build swap
If Spanners runs its course, may I suggest "Bridge Bros" as an alternative/Bad Boys alliterative callback?
42:45 😂
my fav part was 39:09
@RealCivilEngineerGaming Need a bridge review 36:12
The amount of clutches the sub 1s did is impressive
43:26 the top tuah
mumbo is always the dying test subject
42:45 is the funniest out of context thing I’ve heard 😂
Such a fun series. The wild cards are so unique
Grian’s inventory is giving me so much anxiety
I really hope all of these mods are going to be available to play after the series
Why is no hermit craft being posted? Did the season end so fast?
I can not actually hear the typing because the others were being way too loud.
Eating dirt and flying is weirdly simmilar to the blurbs skyrim text to speak storyline
48:00 I think it’d be cool if you guys built up a big stone rock pillar to meet with the bottom of your chair platform.
This new gimmick is really creative!! I love looking forward to the wild cards and seeing how they impact every player! I’ve been watching this season with my partner and we’ve really enjoyed the first two eps. Can’t wait to see the next one when we watch it on Monday!!!
Brilliant!
43:21 top tuah?? ta;l tuah??? the podcast talk tuah??? liek the hawk tuah??? like when I hawk tuahh spit on that thang??? guys... lagugh hguys... pleas.e. leuagh pleas d a
You should call yourself the sugarplum fairies! 27:44
bro spanneurs
16:40 max arua actived
42:45 LOOOOOOOOL
The "spanners" should build a wizzard tower of the meeting room like the other serie
Wild Card idea: Arrow Rain. At random intervals, arrows will start raining from the sky for a few seconds.
Anyone else waiting for the next episode to come out?
24:02 the "skizz is floating" in the middle of a rant is so real 😂😂😂
in the final episode all the wild card should be play at the same time
26:17 why do you have a skeleton spawn egg
Bro u got a server?
According to Google spanner means a stupid or unintelligent person… I’m not saying Mumbo and Skizz are unintelligent but they did some unintelligent things this session so the name is kind of fitting 😂 I love them, but… 5 lives lost is rough 😅
6:12 😂aww come on mumbo it cant be that small
Do a video on trying to rebuild your old hermitcraft bases from memory
I'm still not sure how "I really like your skin, always have" was a clue for the wildcard lol
Not naming this episode “hunger games” was a missed opportunity
I just eat my seed"
Wild Life Idea: Doom Status. At First 1player has a Doom Status that can be pass to someone else by punching them, the player who has a Doom Status can also inflict darkness on other players near them just like Warden does, so they're being paranoid that someone has a Doom Status near them but also got a hard time avoiding them because of the darkness, the duration of the status is undetermined and random. once the player annihilated another Doom Status is generated. might be on 2players or more  the next time it happen.
Wild Life idea: get randomly the ability of hostile mobs. Example: Zombie: you will burn on direct sunlight. Creeper: you will explode if some approaches you. Creeking: you can't move if someone is looking at you. Enderman: you can't go on water Shulker: you make someone float when you hit them.
what a good episode
I love how you just see people floating and falling in he background. I just makes me crack up each time. Heres a few, and i might add some more: 34:16
Hermitcraft where?😭
I just realized the three bridges sorta resembled the three spanners ⚆ᗜ⚆)
I feel like im the only one who saw Joel and Gem's car and thought, "IT'S A CA-HAR"
grian: i think this is the record for bridge to base ratio.  **flashbacks to bread bridge**
Plonker? I hardly know her!
Possible team name bridgeadears
Best jimmy quote
I love how everyone just collectively starts terraforming when having conversations
43:00 male humour at its finest
30:04 Would cherry-flavoured Wotsits be a good idea, or a bad idea?
Bridges secret life starter base doesn't count like the only base with a bridge doesn't count
31:53 I know Grian made the season, but can someone explain why he needs a spawn egg?
24:28 those clouds and the sun look like a mumbo winking
42:45
I’ve anticipated a third video from you all this entire day. Get to it!
For your bridge base what if u build a cloud then have a bridge connecting the cloud to the bridges 🤔
actually though? I miss hermitcraft
This whole thing could be a horror film  In a dystopian future where traditional food sources have vanished, society grapples with bizarre alternatives: spades, dirt, and other unconventional items. As people consume these odd "foods," they face unpredictable side effects, including levitation and strange transformations. Desperate for a true source of nutrition, a group of survivors embarks on a perilous journey to uncover the secret behind their increasingly volatile sustenance, only to discover that each new food source brings more chaos and danger than they could ever imagine.
The Bridgertons
There’s a bit near the end where water’s cascading over the bridges, and it gave me the thought that a waterfall in front of the bridges would be SO COOL
I love how this wild card kept remixing, making the feeling of discovery and chaos last even towards the end of the episode!! :D I love how you call diamonds sugar plum fairies lol!
Team name for Grian's crew:  The Mad Dicers, because everything with them is a crazy dice toss of tomfoolery
This is great
I dub it the Tri-hard bridge.
We need boogeyman
That bonus clip was hilarious
Episode 2 was basically the hunger games
Wild card idea - mobs get stronger the longer they stay alive. Could promote cooperative mob hunting or absolute chaos
I like the car 👀👀
33:36 that’s what she said ;)
when your father was a flying spanner , which is  an aircraft engineer who flies with the aircraft and attends to it at remote airports wherever it goes.
14:52 yall this music give you guys goofy oompa loompa vibes
Why do you have a spawn egg in your inventory 🤨
Being called a spanner is calling someone only good for one thing.
Is no one going to mention the spawn egg in Grian's inventory
You all will be known as the Sub-One Floaters! More like you all just obtain a name addition each wild card at this rate xD
This one feels a lil too random of a gimmick tbh. It would have been fun if it only randomized once since people would of had the chance to use them, but it was too random and just became chaotic nonsense.
Definitely should have been called the bridgeadier
22:05 38:00 42:52
Imagine a comment on Grian's channel about subscribing to Bdubs from watching Skizz's intro on Mumbo's video.
"I'm in so hard already" - Grian. Well I already know that quote will turn up in an out of context video
42:45 has me actually crying laughing. Jimmy putting a new meaning to "wild" life XD loving this series so far 🎉
29:09.  I love when Grian or cleo makes a Red Dwarf Reference.
man they really put their hearts and soul into those bridges
skizz feels like a more aggressive scar
My favorite trio has banded together and I'm all for it.
21:29 it is hilarious that grian gets all the good normal food while mumbo is just getting infested and poisoned
“Eat my balls” nice words jimmy
Gre get your dim pic back
Grian I wish that everyone had a different wild card, because after I watch 3 or 4 different POVs I’m already burned out on the concept. In other Life series I would watch between 8 to 10 different POV and get something unique out of each episode. I love what you do, but this one is not as enjoyable so far.
where is hermitcraft been?
The floaters just going around eating their neighbors lawns 😅
This feels really similar to the Hermitcraft seed. Great video btw, always great to see the fun that you guys get up to 👍👍
i wish grian didn't know what the wildcards were
15:16 skizz' scream all the way down had me
This doesn't feel like a life series. This might be the only one I don't finish, much less watch multiple times:(  Hopefully it gets better because I really love the life series.
You know what would be funny, if they progressively added things to the team name, like the one they have now is “the sub one floaters” and by the end itll be a bunch of gibberish
42:45 So I was drinking water and spat it out when I heared that, like I genuinely did
Never in my life did I think I’d witness 3 grown men floating through the sky by shoveling dirt into their mouths
"This is the most bridges in a life series..." pans to sad Bread Bridge :(
I finally found them I finally found green after 2 years The last time I saw or watch green was like 2 years ago
Omg thank you so much for the CAPTIONS!!
22:26 this should be animated
52:45 thats a grat idea!!!
37:07 dripstone is drip
Every time mumbo was struggling, grian found something that you can actually eat but never gave the correct one to him. Lol
25:59 you missed iron
Grian not realizing that red dye gave him 4 hunger bars is such a Grian thing to do
I love it that last episode the call Scar “A Big Oaf”
I think everyone would have laughed pretty hard if Grian accidentally ate that chest plate.
I just had an idea for the next Life series: Shared Life. It's like Double Life, but the entire server shares health and lives. But there are collaborative challenges that can earn back lost lives, or even go well beyond 3 lives,, as well as challenges to reward hearts well beyond the basic 10. The twist? Damage dealt is tracked per person and the person that dealt the LEAST amount of damage to the group, intentionally or accidentally, is the winner. It can either be the SHORTEST life series, or the most chaotic series yet.
42:44 lmao
1.2 m views 🎉
gotta say i love the creative builds and sceaming undertones in everyones vids XD no need to worry ther wil be action, sooooon
42:45 ive never laughed so hard at a grian video and im not afraid to say it 💀💀
i'd like Real Civil Engineer to rate their bridges lmao
39:13 just straight up ban tango 😂 that wouldve been so funny
19:32 that's because your in the same team
It's unfortunate that Mumbo starved while Grian was taking care of admin stuff, but I think Grian's Watcher lore just got an interesting addition.
This episode was the hunger games
Alternate title: "Eating Balls."
was the skin clue because of mumbo's waffle? lol
change your team name every episode to match the twist
Im learning about uk slang causs of this video
You should keep adding onto the group name. Sub Ones. Then Sub One Floaters…so on
He already forgot about bread bridge noooooo 35:24
I'm so curious about the skin "hint," like, what does it mean???
"sugar-plum fairy boy" fan-artist, GOD SPEED TO YOU ALL!!!
PLONKERRR 😂
The fact grian left the balls joke in 😂 pure semi pg moment ❤️
35:30 THE BAD BOYS BREAD BRIDGE!
What’s with the spawn egg? 2:31
The +3 bridger/bridges?
I think the food tab at the start was simply filtering whether something was considered "edible", not necessarily things that would fill hunger. Afaik not EVERYTHING was edible at a given time right? So that's what I think happened anyway.
Why does Grian have a skeleton spawn egg?
Grian "I'm in so hard already"
So this is kind of random, and I doubt that anyone will even see it, but thank you for posting videos, grian I'm trans and my family doesn't like it. Even though I'm in my early 20s, because of housing prices, I don't make enough to live on my own while doing school unless I want a lot of debt. Living with my mom has been very hard. There have been multiple times this month, where she has tried to get me to stop HRT, even though it really helps my dysphoria. Between that and school, it's hard to find joy in life sometimes, but your videos are always joyful and silly. They've genuinely made my life a bit better, so thank you
Haven’t watched Brian in so long, always will come back for this series!
Wildcard Idea: Randomized keybinds for controls
The series is awesome.  Thanks for all the laughs and memorable moments Grian.
There used to be so much more pvp before, there’s barely any now
Did anyone else hear the faint scream as skizz died 😂 Edit: after further watching the video i see that skizz died more than once. Rip 💀
Grian, grian, grian. EVERYTIME. EVERYTIME with the flamable builds!
3:05  solar flare!!!
35:21 cough cough “bread bridge”
Grian: The spanners? As if that needs any explaining! Mumbo: You see bridges span things... Grian: 😮 I'm in.
Put a cage under the meeting bridge
Have the bridge at the top loop back to the one at the bottom spaning infinityly
You need to build a massive spanner as your base
Your group name should change every episode based on the wildcrad
Am I the only one seing a face in the base???
42:43 is going in a life out of context compilation
@grian , next season should be 2 people linked to each other by distrance. than the distance get reduced every min. So when one linked player moves north the second player also gets dragged north. So it’s never possible to move further than the distance from your linked player.
Wildcard: bumping into players sends them flying
It’d be fun if the final wildcard of the series was just every previous wildcard at once or rotating every few minutes
how does Grian have a spawn egg?!
Spanner in German would yes be very Mumbo
Such foul language from the Brits.
ONE EPISODE A DAY
Grian, for the last session, you should use all the wild cards that have been used in the other sessions
if you go frame by frame, you can see that skizz was 4 pixels away from killing himself
They're the Bridge Boys! 🌁
Mumbo will change name of the group every session cause of twists
I'm all up for the team name changing every session
"You will never be that high again you will be chasing that dragon for the rest of your life" wow
Is the wither effect not included with this wildcard because I'm surprised nobody got it while testing foods and I'm surprised nobody died from it
grain
19:18  wait till grian and skiz finds out last season of hermitcraft he and big b wanted to call themselves the axis untill peral reminded them  what that means😭😭😭
For the finally the wild card should be the boarder turns to lava and it slowly shrinks in until its small enough for the final two people to have a dramatic fight
Grian and Mumbo talking about Mumbo almost dying Random Guy falling from the sky: 34:17
this calls for a BRIDGE REVIEW
Name idea, bridgie boys
Idea: brunable objects have a chance of being set on fire randomly
rahh i love this series so much
Minecraft needs to make a Grian language like with LoLcat and diamonds are sugar plum fairy
I really like the Bridge Base! It looks really cool
Grian Consistently missing when an item gives him good food points is infuriating.
Grian, sometimes gives me David Tenant (Crowley) vibes. From the show Good Omens, on Amazon Prime. These series are always so chaotic, I love it!!!!
I really hope they make a pond or something under the meeting platform
Plz episode 26 of hermitcraft
NAH WHAT ABOUT BAD BOYS BREAD BRIDGE??
42:45 WHAT-
Grian has this incredible ability of partying up with allies who just casually die several times.
Your group is called sub1’s because of the sub1 intelligence
39:08 Grian threatening to ban Tango was hilarious
could be called the sub-terrainians
15:16   Grian: Where did everyone go  Skizz:AHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhh
Whats the spawn egg at 12:55?
How quickly we forget Bread Bridge.
I'm really enjoying seeing everyone in the chaos of the life series' again :D
someone should make a wild life animation with the payphone song from maroon 5
42:46 not sure if Grian is family friendly anymore 😂
Spanner in german means Peeping Tom. So basically you’re the Peeping Toms 😄
the loudest laught ever after Jimmy say "eat my ball" 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 it been a long time didn't hear that laughter
Fwip to the next life series
skizz was also starving in bonus clip why not fed him
the meeting area should be a floating island with a bridge connecting it
4:48 someone clip it!
Why does Grian have a panda spawn egg?
British yelling at echother: Spanner, Skullywag.  Americans: *****,******,****,***
The people from above are totally using scar’s roller coaster to drop tnt mine carts on these guys
It's funny hearing you say sugar plum fairy, because that is what my mom would always say to keep from swearing in front of me as a kid.
spanners reminds me so much of the sky boys
Bro forgot about hermitcraft 😢
32:29 flashbacks to the timed one. Also, name idea: BRIDGE BOYS!
Really enjoying this series! Reminds me of the chaos from early modded days
This video is the definition of Bigback
The Bridge Crew
42:45, I literally cried. I am laughing so hard 🤣
26:25 It really is just filling him up
I need a candy called “cherry whats-its”
Hey Grian, I just wanted to say thank you for all you do. I’ve had a really rough day and your videos never fail to put a smile on my face so from the bottom of my heart, Thank You and the rest of the Hermitcrafters for making me smile.
You often make jokes on ‘boring the audience’ with things like resource gathering and other more hum drum Minecraft tasks, but you’ve got a skill for knowing what to keep in those moments! Every part of every video is fun and feels important have. Even a longer video like this one all feels worth its place, every minute deserves to be here.  I always look forward to your videos no matter the topic because I know they’ll be snappy and tight without feeling too fast or like things are being left out. Brilliant, fantastic work as always Grian!!!! 🧡🧡🧡
FLOAT, YOU FOOLS!
OMG EP 2 WOOOO!! Omg the food!? This is gonna be so good lol! But so hard to lol MUMBO AND U JUST FREAKING OUT IS SO FUNNY YOUR LIKE “mumbo don’t move. MUMBO DONT MOVE ITS STRESSING ME OUT HERE EAT THIS.. NO? OK THIS BOWL? NO OK UHH” AND SKIZZ JUST LAUGHING AT IT IS SO FUNNY LOL also did I hear… A BAD BOYS BREAD BRIGE REFERENCE?!?!!!!! Well not reference as such BUT IK U WERE TALKING ABOUT IT!!! The bridges are amazing lol AND SKIZZ ON LIGHT GREEN ALREADY?!? Omg skizz will be out by ep 4 if he keeps this up! Let’s hope not lol also wonder how in the future u may get tango back heh and they end clip LOL U CUT THE BIT OF U TYPING OUT WHEN WE FIRST SAW IT so we all were just like oh u didn’t get to give him food on time yk BUT NOW WITH THE BOUNS CLIP OMG😭😭 it was so funny tho u just there while mumbo and skizz are like “ AHHH MUMBO WHAT DO I EAT SKIZZ IM GONNA STRAVE IDK AHH!” LOL THEN U JUST CAME BACK “OMGG MUMBO HERE AHHH” LOL poor mumbo but u didn’t didn’t mean to slay him so it’s fine lol! LOVED THIS EP IT WAS SO FUNNY LOL!
Idea for a Wild Card: Every time a player left clicks, they switch places with a random opponent.
THE BRIDGE BOYS
I’ve only gotten through like half of the video as I’m commenting this, but I am absolutely dying to know what happens if someone eats rotten flesh for this wild card. I haven’t seen anyone try that yet, but if someone did, I’d like to know
18:50 38:15 42:46 48:06 49:57 52:48 Ripppp
Now the spanners need some banners
how did grian get a spawn egg
Every time Grian ate a crystal I laughed a little
spanner search rates rn📈📈📈📈📈
42:44
38:30 YOU CAN SEE THE MURDER!!! BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER YOU SEE TANGO CROUCHING TO NOT EAT THE BLOCKS AND YOU SEE SKIZZ'S DEAD BODY!!
26:48 poor Pearl 😂
The last session should have all the wildcards at once
A boat in the water would have killed Tango as he fell unless he clicked it
Productivity is *NOT* ruining your video!
During the construction of the golden gate bridge 10 men fell being caught by a safety net and the men decided to call themselves The halfway to hell club mumbo could be the 11th member
42:33 Mumbo being the most British person ever
Watch the music video daisies it looks like u
I slowed down skizz's fall 16:09 he came within a slab distance of death.
Grian videos: 99%- messing about 1%- productivity
The way you gave the hint of “I really like your skin” while showing your waffle was genius!!!
I feel like this session was just one big out of context video😂😂
I wish you kept each twist and just added each thing
hermitcraft??
42:44 Jimmy: Eat my balls! Grian: Laughter intensifies Mumbo: Gladly
Grian, you are absolutely diabolical, I love it!  Idea for another session, ever minute (or longer if there's less players by that point), 2 people randomly get teleported to each other location. The randomizer should take into account that everyone must be teleported at least once before a player can be teleported again, this way everyone is affected at some point guarunteed but they just don't know when or with who they will swap places
50:34 broken bridges don't bridge  Mumdo Jumbo 2024
Last comment. Don't know if anyone else has brought it up, but in the US, not everyone knows a spanner is a wrench (mostly people who work with tools or people who enjoy British media) much less a name to call someone.  I wonder if Skizz left this session super confused why y'all were laughing so much at the name, especially with your rude name lesson.
One thing i learned today is that grian doesnt do well under pressure 😂
Mumbo struggling to get out “Maybe one of the…..” legitimately cracked me up. I wasn’t expecting it. 😂
This is one of the most chaotic distractible episodes of the Life series imo and I’m digging it
25:59 i hope he got that iron between clips because its really bothering meeee
"I'm just ate my seeds!"  - Mumbo 2024
I had to look up the slang definition of spanner T-T
Because broken bridges don’t bridge -Mumbo jumbo 2024
Nobody expects the Spanners Inquisition!
4:46 "wait i ate my seeds"
muboo so cute man
MumboJumbo is the normal-sized version of Mumbo, and Mumbo on its own is the small version
35:21 what about bread bridge…
what happened to the boogeyman in this series?
When Grian looked at the bridges and said “I think that’s the best base I ever built” I was really hoping mumbo would say something like “oh yeah the mansion was NOTHING. THIS is true art and scale.” 😂 Also I was pretty confident they were just gonna change their name every episode depending on the wild card lol
1:30 wait until Joel tries to join
42:44 With is 😂this
You should make the next season be that like the border closes in by like 5-10 blocks every episode I feel like that could be cool
How come Grian has a skeleton spawn egg?
This life series isn’t life serieing
5:00 why does he have a spawn egg?
Crazy Wild Card Ideas:  Everytime someone says the name of another member, that member will be teleported to the person who said it. (This could make for a lot of funny moments for when people are secretly talking about someone.)  Everyone is invisible, and name tags are off.  All players and mobs have max knockback. Fall damage is turned off.  Jumping will give a random other person on the server a random potion effect.
A new nickname would be the bridge bros
I wish jimmy was in hermitcraft so we can make a horn of him saying "Hey by the way if you eat my balls" 42:45
7:11 grian not realizing red dye was a great food source 😭
The bridge boys
wild card idea, tag. hit a person to not be it. the person to be it at the end of the session becomes redname
i cant wait for the next episode this so fun
Who else thinks grian Should add a MINY bread bridge to the collection of bridges
If evil anvil doesn’t use eat my balls in the song for this season whenever that happens imma be sad
Just imagining animatics of a fat Grian eating gold telling Mumbo all the types of good food while Mumbo standard there emaciated at 1 hp.
26:30 Oh nooo Grian. Soo many people are gonna clip h6im outta context xd
44:35 **Tango dies** YEAAHHHHHH
If you think about it, the top bridge looks like eyes, and the second bridge looks like a mouth
Mumbo: "I just ate my seeds" 😳😳😳😳
what if this teams thing was that they change their name every week
YES YOU DID CAPTIONS FINALLY :DD
VERY excited for the Sugar Plum Fairy Boy art
man jimmy's gonna get slaughtered in the out of context clips. i really hope calamity can isolate mumbo saying he had a lovely pair.
Throughout this video I just kept looking at the spawn egg that's in Grians inventory.
for a Wildcard idea, i think it would be cool in theory if there was a crafting recipe randomizer (where usual recipes turn into other things (for example a crafting table --> diamond shovel) but i don't know how good that would be in practice lol. it might throw off the power balance if everyone found a cheat code for some OP items, but it'd be interesting for sure!
Heres to hoping they dont become the Dis-Spanners
Just a question grian when are you going back to hermitcraft
23:57 I love how skiz is the child of the family who would get himself into trouble the second you look away😂
there the bridge buddies
19:29 Skizz went half invisible, it might be because that the command used some of the Team command feature in the game. The "Team" doesn't mean that the player's team, its only a command feature. BUT the problem here is that by default, players could see the invisible players on the same Team. This could very well be an unintended outcome as a side effect of the commading, and it could cause some problem. It means that players can't use invisibility potion in this season, and it could very well mean that  *Secret Life spoiler ahead*  The scene like when martyn got invisible and climbed up Grian's tower might not be able to happen if the problem's not fixed.  The problem(if it is truely an unintended outcome and if the problem is truely because of the team command, that is) could be fixed by a single command /team modify <team> seeFriendlyInvisibles false Where <team> is the team name you used when developing.
This series is so much fun! Please tell me random loot drops is going to be next! XD
Why is Grian giving such mom energy this episode?
30:30 Oh hi Abigail from Stardew
I think this season should have also had the boogeymen in it. it would have added some complexity to choosing your size in ep 1 and added more usefullness for the combat foods in ep 2.
im a spanner
42:45 lmao
Combining Grian, Mumbo, and Skizzleman gives you Grumbleman, perhaps the worst trio name yet
The Sub 1 Floaters
19:04 Mumbo also came up with the Axis as a team name last season…
Are helmets banned?
“between the 3 of us we have are lost five lives”  “between the 2 of you we have lost five lives”
16:23 ‘that was PLUS ONE AWESOME’ mumbo sounds like a dad
5:37 this etho save is kinda legendary 6:54 there goes mumbo 7:50 REN LMAO 8:02 and skizz 16:09 SKIZZ 42:45 hey by the way
12:27 i’m crying i love mumbo and grian content
they should change their group name every episode
/ban tango
Please let there be a gravity card
Grian: "I can't think of a base in Third Life that's had this much bridge."  SkyNet: "..."
Where are the gale comments?
Love the sub one floating spanners
This episode was so funny😂
Yeah Mumbo's death at the beginning was totally Grian's fault. He claimed he was trying to give him food, but Mumbo was clearly in trouble long before then.
Where is hermitcraft
41:06 42:44 49:51
43:20 talk tuah reference??!?!!
Why did Grain have a spawn egg
Just change  your name each episode 😅
32:07 *secret life flashbacks*
I can already see the compilations. Mumbo and Skizz being sus of Grian for 9 minutes straight.
Fun episode! I'm so excited to see all the wildcards (and of course, the player chaos, lol)
How are we like 6 seasons in and the colours are still not colourblind friendly?! Grian. Green, Lime Green and Yellow look the EXACT same for me and Red only looks slightly different. Use Yellow, Blue, Black, White, etc for very different colours
How Hungry?🐴
MUMBO IS A RED BULL DAREDEVIL.
Watcher grian writers going RABID
15:14 is truly one of my favorite moments so far in the life series.
"We almost built as many bridges as we've lost lives" You boys should think about doing that!! every time someone dies they add something to the existing bridges or add another bridge!! Loving this sieries as always <3
42:45 WHAT- 😭⁉️
Grian: Magic carpets? Nah! Solid metre blocks of dirt, YES!
“I cant think of a base in the life series thats had this much bridge”  Bread Bridge: 😢
Grian seems rather insistent on people getting water buckets.  Next episode, water will catch you on fire.
I haven't been this excited for a series in so long :) I've been loving both episodes so far
i love how much that grian hates that giant car HAHA
1:13 it sounded like skizz said my real life I was so confused
Wild card idea - nether trees are in the over world and over world trees are in the nether 😂 these videos never fail to make me laugh
Where’d grian get a spawn egg
You could be the “micro floaters”
Not the Sugar Plum Fairy
''wait i just ate my seeds'' - mumbojumbo 2024
Sub one life
The reactions to each starving death- Mumbo: Horrified misclicking Ren: Outro Skizz:          .
The boiz out here eating Polished Deepsteak
Bread Bridge had that much bridge
NOT THE CAR BASE SLANDER PLEASE 😭✋️
22:30 The whole bowl exchange had me dying laughing 😂😂😂 'You've given me a bowl. A bowl to eat. You really think that's gonna work? No. I've just zoomed in. Nice." 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
33:50 did anyone else notice the falling light dots on the left side of the screen on the sky
what were did he get a skeleton spawn egg
"I don't want to be a bridge idiot" seconds before Mumbo floats away and  dies.  You can't script that comedy gold.😂
I had to pause this video for an event and I came back very confused to grian eating deepslate
Everytime they said Floater I kept going to the band.
This is either going to be the longest season or the shortest season… because damn people be dying fast
I would love to see a wild card where the dead players come back and have to help somebody and kill another player
Next series: Half life; each person starts with a higher than normal number of hearts, and each time they die their health halfs.
Sub -1 crew def needs bridges everywhere
grian in hermit craft: i really like your face, i need it...  grian in wild life: i really like your skin
it feels so weird for u guys to just talk about revenge and eating clay balls
19:11 I think it would be funny if you changed the name every episode.
The group name changes every video, since the effect also changes.
Grian what about Hermit Craft
Still confused on how “I really like your skin” has to do with being able to eat everything Hilarious episode tho
Plaease play subnuatica
PLEASE be the Floaters. PLEASE
Whe n jimmy said ... I died
Skizzcarus nearly fell too close to the earth
let me slurp up this scrumptious 1 hour long session of this series :DDD
A spanner is like... a wrench or something.
This video is so confusing, I have no idea what's going on
the pg rating floated away just like mumbo 10/10
Grain don't you ever do that to me again, a diamond chestplate is to be respected at all times!
be the Sub One Brain cells
where did everyone go AHHHHHHHHHH peak
honestly, on that bonus clip, the interaction between Mumbo and Skizz in that moment was so much fun to watch from their points of view. If you hadn't been busy it might have changed what happened
Wild Card Idea: All players Randomly Switch Locations with one another.
Wild Life Suggestions:   - Tools are randomized a few times like this episode does gor food (for example, pickaxes could function as shovels for a while instead)  - crafting recipes are slightly altered (logs make the wrong kind of planks, tool recipes are mixed up)
God creating turkeys: 45:41
can i just ask what the spawn egg is about?? i dont remember him getting it or what it would be for and nothing was said about it so im a little confused
Does he get neitherite?
I love the twist this season, these are always so entertaining!
It would be pretty funny if this team changes its name each session.
2:21 if yoz cut away the very right one of the trees, the whole Thing looks like a giant.......snail.
35 on trending Grian started flying
The car happens to look like a 70's Dodge Charger or Challenger and my first thought was of Dominik Toretto's car from the Fast & Furious series so maybe that group is all about FAMILY and that's the joke 😂😂😂
A bit off topic but grian PLEASE do this year's phasmophobia Halloween event
I think the idea behind this season is genius! Its a brilliant way to keep things fresh, because no-one is doing what they usually do in the early game. Normally, by now, people would have built a base, gathered resources, started farms, and gone mining. But  people are too busy goofing off, having fun and/or panicking to have done that properly yet. And, as was mentioned in this session, people seem to have forgotten the premise of the series.Absolutely brilliant. Can't wait to see how this plays out as the lives decrease😊
22:12 Deepslate Bricks was jump boost.
I mean...the floaters is a great name. Just look it up. Their number one hit fits this episode perfectly
Wildcard Idea:  Opposite day. everything is backwards, wooden tools are the best, lava is safe and water is deadly. and Certain mob behaviors/mechanics are swapped or changed, such as creepers creating blocks and zombies using bows.
Everyone's complete lack of inventory management in these is killing me.
For a wildcard you should have reverse gravity
50:00 Mumbo: '' being called a spanner in english is the rudest thing ever '' Grian: '' its like being called a PLONKER '' Skizz: *utter confusion*
Next session you should dress up as a mechanic and place tnt in the car lol
The scream skizz scrumpt at 15:15. so good, so prox chat
The bridges kind of remind me of this Norwegian movie, "Flåklypa Grand Prix", and the road up to the house there
Wild card idea: each time you jump one random key stops working(space key excluded)
I wonder how the theme song is going to be.
4:35 absolute chaos as everybody tries to figure out what's going on, and then you just have mumbo looking away munching on a diamond pick.
The subtitles are really impressive and nice thank you for doing those
Just out of curiosity, why or how does grian have spawn egg?
Just make the name whatever the twist is
I hope for Zombie Mode - getting damaged by sunlight xD
Broken bridges, don't span
Idea: Just change your group name every episode depending on the wild card For The Bit™️
They should call themselves the Bridgers or The Bridgets
42:47  well..
You should combine the names. Every episode. The sub one floaters. At the end of the series you’d have a ridiculously long name
why can't the wildcards be like... randomly picked? like 30 wildcards 1 is picked like each episode and it's picked randomly wouldn't that work?
floaters was the axis all over again lol
Digital Devil Saga
Grian! This is an emergency!   Theres a plauge of paranoia surfing the server!  Skizz and mumbo have already been effected! I think your next!   Stay calm and dont think that mumbo is going to push you off a bridge with a bucket full of fish!
Grian your inventory and hot bar are hurting my brain 😂😂
Hi grian, love the vid. I think it would be cool if you would release uninterupted footage of all 3 hours per episode.
For a wildcard what if every half-hour or so people character skins' and names get swapped so then no one will know each other.
clean ur inventory
Could there be a boogie man tag as a wildcard ? Even pore paranoia for the spanner’s 😂
I actually yelled out “STOP IT!” as he was eating the diamond armor
Hi grian will u ever bring back build swap?
nice, I love the concept for wild life that and a bunch of cool YouTubers make it amazing I can't wait for the next episode :)
42:45 ok so like we can agree that we are going to quote jimmy
Why does Mumbo have grians waffle?
If I don't see someone get spartan kicked of one of your bridges in series I'm going to be sad
after some rough calculations i found that a player falls at about 1254.4 pixels a second or about 1 pixel per 0.00079 second. Skizz was about 5 pixels from the ground there for if he had eaten the dirt 0.004 seconds later he would have died.
@matthewhowe2762  The abridged Sub-1's
42:46 Grian’s laugh never fails to make me smile
CreeperCorp says you’re welcome for killing Tango
“this is the most bridge base in all of the 3rd life series” so bread bridge means nothing to you????
E v P
I know you're feeling ill, and I do hope you feel better but Doc should have been added to life series. 😊
18:03 is no one going to talk about the spawn egg
I like the fading in and out of the messages
Group Name: SMG (Skizz, Mumbo, Grian) because you three are dealing death left and right!! Too bad it's in the form of Russian Roulette....  Skizz performed a sub-1 save!! Sub-1 block away from death! Too bad he's a one-hit wonder.  There have been so many instances of panic from food and that's a refreshing bit of tomfoolery!! Well done on this wildcard pick!!
The meeting room feels like the cherry tree club except scar is skizz
We need this group to be called “The Nameless” but every session they have a new name (courtesy of MUMBO) 😂
Why does Brian end up with bridge builds? 😂😂😂😂 first bread bridge, now tribridge
The final episode better be all the wildcards combined
✨OOH SUGERPLUM FAIRY✨ 🧚‍♀️
Cherry whatsits sounds like a British candy
What did you do today. Grien: floted with dirth that i stole from a old lady mirdmade. Meow. hi, hej, helo, hola, a-hoj, goten tag, halo, konnichiwa, bonjour ♤] ¡$ #€£
33:30 I’m in so hard already. Quote of the day see you another day
“I can’t think of a base with more bridge.” Bread Bridge: “Am I a joke to you?”
I cant beleive you guys were using this kinda of horrible language
The final episode should be ALL the wild cards at once.
Alzternative Title: I'm building the most unsafe base in a series that is about NOT dying
Idk if it's like that in English but in German Spanner is a stalker. 😂❤
for every life you loose you build another bridge
A wild card idea: all players must be within a certain range of another player, otherwise they will start taking damage :D
42:45
Where did you get the spawn egg?
4:54 ima leave this here   Edit:this too 27:55 and 42:45
4:49 "I just ate my seeds" - Mumbo 2024
Maybe a floating wood platform id not the best idea in a series famous for burnt bases
42:55 ermmmm mumbo?? 😀😀😀 wym by that :DDD
How does grian have a spawn egg
40:44 grians evil laugh
Broken bridges won't spanner a plunker... right? 🤔
First base Grian ever built that had a back to it
Dibi dimond dimond
Funny thing: In german, a 'Spanner' is a 'peeping tom' :D
What happened to hermitcraft
The way "Spanner" in German means something like Stalker 💀
Grian should add a roof and a bunch of dripstone so that if someone attacks they can ... Uh..make them kebabs 😅
I wanna say it now... No one from the "Spanners" is going to win, but, man, is it some good entertainment value! xD
This session's wildcard was popular Klei game Don't Starve, so the next wildcard should be another Klei game, Oxygen Not Included (probably inverted water breathing)
What about bad boys' bread bridge / skynet? 35:27
"I don't thin there has been a base in the life series that has been this much bridge" ummm justice for bread Bridge. Abd that whole series was full of sky bridges.
8:07 Etho(?) just ascending in the back ground 💀💀
it would have been so much better if the wildcards would stack
GRIAN - Idea for a Wild Card: MIDAS TOUCH.  Every block broken/mined just drops Gold Ore. UNLESS... players use Gold tools!  Most blocks will still be able to be broken/mined, except for higher tier ore blocks. The caveat being that Gold tools have low durability (a minor inconvenience). Breaking or mining blocks with any other tools, items, or with an empty hand will result in Gold ore dropping.
Act like Scar is an idiot for making a rollercoaster, go back to building bridges to nowhere for no reason like it’s normal.
Comented this on the first episode, but did it today so if you don´t read those coments anymore. Next season should be "Night Life" where you have kind of a lot of lives but nightime is even more deadly with custom mobs etc and maybe a mechanic that the mobs don´t like the light, so light sources are necesary but people will take them away or maybe torches despawn or something.
What Mumbo?!? That’s was def 10/10 on awesome scale!!!!
wild card idea: tnt spawns on a random person every 30 seconds
The whole sequence of Grian telling Mumbo to calm down while throwing random items at him had me in tears
42:44
the sugarplum fairy!! >//<
Sorry i mean say not day
I think a good idea would be if you say a players name you swap items skins and position and have a voicechanger to make you sound like the player until someone swaps with you or the other player or day your name if you are going to do a shoutout say james conway
Okay, Watcher lore creators, I need you to take the bonus clip and create an in-universe explanation for it. Chop, chop! /j
22:31 “A wooden bowl? Grian, you’ve given me a bowl. A bowl to eat. You really think that’s gonna work? ……. Nope. I’ve just ZOOMED in. Nice. 😡” Mumbo oh my word, I cried 😂
Fun fact, Spanner is also a German word and basically means Peeping Tom, soo... Well, you are spying on people from up there...
Grian not realizing that red dye gave him 4 hunger bars is such a Grian thing to do.
Loving this adventure so far What’s the best survival tip you've learned from this episode
The car giving grian the ick is incredibly funny
32:10 You see if you were to put drip stone above you people like scar and jimmy (not that they’ll be alive) will be able to drop it on you heads
35:30 what about bread bridge from limited life?
Skynet 2.0?
Okay ik this is great but when's hermit craft ep26?
They are known by many names: the sub 1s, the floaters, the spanner’s. But one thing is for sure: they aren’t the smartest group you’ll ever meet.  P.s. I am not saying this to be mean, I love your content.
"the spanners" is an interesting choice for a name. in german, a "spanner" is someone who engages in voyuerism(the one watching).
No pinning. NO PINNING.
24:41 MINECRAFTER AT DOOR 30!
Remove the textures on all items when in the inventory/chests and stuff. Or make everything have weak durability. Including items without durability. Could you imagine how funny it would be for your dirt block to break?
Cool idea: At the finale episode, you could bring all of these wildcards back but like they all happen at different times in the season but they stack?
10:40 why does grian have a spawn egg
The disorders of the wild life series so far Episode 1: Gigantism and Dwarfism Episode 2: PICA
Most bridge in a base... and they don't think that achievement to the bread bridge?
Did anybody else notice at 34:16 somebody just falls from the sky in the background 😂😂
To be honest, I was fully expecting this season of the series to be based around the Trial Chambers since it was the most recent update. I haven't seen any signs though that there's a trial chamber within the map. I feel like that's something that should have been included. I suppose it's possible that it was and no one has found it yet, but trial chambers are pretty large so I'm not convinced of that. Personally, I think the new potions and mace would have added a lot to pvp. Not to mention the wind charges! Honestly, what I was most excited for when the update came out was seeing how it would influence the next season of the Life Series.   I do love the gimmick this season, however, I think just focusing on the Trial Chamber could have been enough without any gimmicks due it adding enough new content to make pvp interesting. I mean, the best part of the previous season was watching everyone mess around with the Wardens. Maybe this is just me though. I do look forward to watching this new season though. At the same time, I'm hoping the next season will focus on the Trial Chambers.
'AVE YOU TRIED MY BALLS MUMBO
i think a waterfall would be perfect. i saw water flowing down and i thought that that looked very good
9/10 dentists would not recommend eating rocks.   Edit: Or Diamond. Especially diamond.
the mental image of these three shoveling dirt into their mouths while floating is so funny
"MSG" team name after this food wildcard
the food tab, is mixed with the miscellanea, sooooo....
43:21 say that again... but slower...
I guess now we know who's going to go out first in this Series, hahah!
15:15 EAT
A cool twist for the final is to give everyone unlimited excess to all items except command blocks
15:17 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Name idea: the Bridgertons (surely) and you have bridges and use English slang
42:46 that's going in an out of context compilation for sure
Pf scrow gravity
Wild card idea, we bring back double life, the wild card could be named this time saying past lives or something similar, and you could have double life being randomly activated not telling them they are put with someone than you could have a boogeyman from last life to put a twist on it.
Will the life series shop be reopening with this series at any point? I would love to get myself some more merch 👀
Grian, there was an internet cut-out where I live. Do you think they are connected?
Later in the series I hope they have the battle of spanner bridge
Grian reminds me of my grandmother
"Spanners"? You missed a perfectly good chance to call yourselves the Spanish. And then go on an Inquisition. Bother everyone on the server by singing the Spanish Inquisition song 😋
You guys made your base the Donkey Kong game :)
@Grian you should do one where everyone swaps places randomly
In a world that now has wind charges, they build a base suspended high in the air over a spikey death trap... 😂
You think you’ve seen bridges? Just wait until you see what I do to just about any large cave or ravine.
I think a plank would be a good extension of a bridge
8:03 The chaos of skizz dying and Etho floating away in the backround
15:17 is by far the funniest thing I have seen today
42:45 “If you eat my balls-“ PFFTTTTTTTTHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
22:16 22:18 spoon egg?
Thank you for your content. I am 27 and going through a pretty rough patch in life. Your content helps me to find some happiness or at least distraction in my day to day life. I really appreciate you. Thank you for everything you do and I hope you are doing great.
So you're telling me that when things go wrong for everyone else in wild life you are going to tell them you threw a spanner in the works?
Hey grian! I've always watched your videos, and I also love them, but I've noticed everyone always hides torches under carpets in Hermitcraft and the Life series, you can hide light sources behind slabs and stairs and light will still shine through them, meaning less noticeable light spots and less clutter!
Petition for them to be the floaters
if i had a nickel for each life series where grian is involved in a trio with a bridge, i would have two nickels. it isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it’s happened twice right?
20:57 This whole sequence of Mumbo panicking about food/starving reminds me of when they played don’t starve together😂😂
44:43 I love you guys taking the credit for Tango’s kill away from the creeper 😂😂
I’m really not enjoying this series. Yous spend most of the time just mucking about doing nothing. It gets in the way of what I love about this group. It’s a distraction I don’t think is necessary
the amount of out of context materials in this episode is insane 😭🤣🙏
There better be a boogeyman event where everyone is a boogeyman and the server turna to a full on war
New Wild Life idea: previous lives. When the wildcard is introduced it goes to the first twist and it changes twists. 1: 3rd life. Your lives are halved and your color is updated accordingly. Half-lives are the color above them. (e.g. 2.5 = green) At the end of this part your lives get doubled again. 2: last life. Boogie. That's it. 3: Double life: literally the same as the real Double Life. 4: Limited Life. You have 10 minutes per life you have to live. If you die you lose 10 minutes and not a life. If you run out of time you lose a life and your time gets updated accordingly. At an hour your life is green, 40- minutes is yellow, 20- is red. You may attack a color above you to regain 5 minutes. 5: Secret Life. You have 20 hearts and a goal. You can complete the goal to regain 10 hearts. You permanently lose hearts when you take damage.
This is so cool.
Sub1 started as a verification of size, now its the amount of collective braincells the group has. The one time grian didnt affiliate with scar he is still stuck with someone just as reckless
grian not knowing that he has. a spawn egg 13:34
Grian's inventory management. GRRRRRR!
42:44 This is going in a compilation😂😂
18:50 im not sure that skizz knows what a floater is in british slang . not sure that mumbo does either
Wild Life is giving me Unattended Kindergarten Class energy. Episode 1: short vs tall, making forts others aren't allowed to enter for silly reasons. Episode 2: eating everything besides food. What is next? Lol
remix the sugar plum fairy pls
26:52 Grian: the real risk in this one is you eat your sword  Pearl: 😮
grian : wait where did everyone go? skizz : AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 15:15
Name idea bridge boys
Am I the only one who noticed the skele spawn egg in grian's inventory the whole time?
Grian will definitely have to change group by episode 3 or 4
Glad to see the series is quickly devolving into complete chaos already on episode two.
35:24 BREAD BRIDGE!?!?!?
Call yourselves the wildcats since you 3 rely on the wildcards  Or the Bridge Brigade
is there a place to download the modpacks used in the life series, so this can be organized with friends ?
Why is there no boogyman? I think that's why everyone is so chill.
Yall are the Sub-One Spanners... and the name will just keep growing each episode...
42:45 I'm dead💀
Your names gotta change every episode
Why does he have a spawn egg ??
43:26 top tuah
I have a strong feeling jimmy will not be the first out
I'm predicting these will be burned (the bridges)
would love to see @docm77 in this series!
43:28  the top tuah are just hangin out
it feels like wildlife got nerfed comparede to the others
I think ALL the starvation deaths are totally unfair especially since you knew what to eat.
Waiting for hermit craft 😂
What if the final wild card.. is ALL of them in one
How does he have a Spawn egg 33:39
"Scar, what are you doing??" "Building a rollercoaster!! 😃"
" most bridge in 3rd life'  grian forgetting about the limited life bread bridge !?!?!
You should change your group name every episode based on the wildcard, Sub-1s to Spanners and so forth, and that's your bit 😂 that would be awesome
Spreading positivity!! The life series is absolutely amazing!! What’re some of your favorite Wild Life moments so far?
mumbo is going THROUGH it this series, dude is SO stressed 😭
you should change the group name every episode
you need to turn the cliff into a waterfall to save skizz
How long has mumbo had a waffle?
I am American and can confirm…no idea what these British words mean, but it’s hilarious hearing them freak out about words that don’t sound real to me 😂🤣
36:20 no, I see it...but It's a backwards S
I mean, we all knew what the sub one club was really about.
wildcard idea: typing someones name in chat tp's them to you
35:42 I think you forgot Bread Bridge 😅
For every death, +1 bridge
I feel like the food was being randomized way too much. Too much of the episode was spent trying to figure out what was edible.
33:47 - I thought the cherry blossom petals were people falling from the sky lol
"broken bridges don't bridge" -Mumbo Jumbo 2024
A wildcard that randomizes drops would be a blast.
I love that from Scars perspective you just hear random bouts of screaming from the precarious situations they put themselves in
i feel like sub one brain cell is still a lot (I owe the mafia like 10 000 brain cells)
I liked gems name for them, the Bridge Idiots
mumbo is so pasionet to do dumb things! ilove it!
Floater please🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
shugerplumferry
This episode is hilarious 😂
In german "spanner" means peeping tom and that made the episode even funnier for me
10:36 this isnt even a mumbo thing, sweet berries do this to me all the time Safe to say i rarely eat them, usually cuz i keep placing them
There are so many out of context compilation-worthy clips in this video that it’s getting unbearable lmao
Dear grian when you guys do the next season of hermit craft I think you guys to try out the create mod because I think a lot of the people in the series I’ve seen do a lot of cool Redstone stuff would like this mod only telling you because every time I see a series, you always say the rules and stuff so I figured I’ll leave it on your channel as a comment
everybody here is like wapol from one piece lol
Fun fact: in German a „Spanner“ quite literally translates to a combination of „stalker“ and „creep“, tieing right into the „ah haw“-meme with the telescope 😂 🔭
Grian I know u say that the car breaks immersion, but it is a very Joel and Gem thing that they would do after being put in a pvp apocalyptic world
“if you eat my balls” JIMMY STOP IT
gotta say i really like how the wild cards are set up, especially this one!! the food gimmick is fun and all, but could get old quickly once people figure out whats good to eat- so having it be randomized every so often is really smart and keeps it interesting. plus, having everyone on hunger 3 definitely ramps it up. shoutout to grian for these, thinking them up and executing them mustve been a challenge- but its awesome :)) cant wait for next saturday!!
👏 EAT 👏THE  👏 FLINT & STEEL 👏
19:35 I believe the invisibility is only 50% because you're all in one team.  im assuming its for the green names but might make somones sneaking attempts fail.
wtf is this series. No plans nothing entertaining so far.
42:46 the laugh is so funny and what he said
42:46 that must be the funniest thing I heard all day.
"we've had more deaths than we had bridges and we've built far too many bridges" 🤣  This is so silly and absolutely amazing! I love this series and this alliance so much. So many hilarious moments.
It would be hilarious if an episode had hostile mobs turned docile and docile mobs turned hostile
42:46 SOMEBODY CLIP THAT
Please let Mumbo change the name every time 😂😂
I like how everyone is building in the same area, it’s a little neighbourhood
I love this series so much keep it up Grian!🔥❤️🐐
13:34 why does he have a spawn egg
Idea- Air makes you drown. You have to be under water to breathe.
Loving the series so far!
Really loving this series so far! The life series is always so fun to watch and the mystery of a new wild card each session is such a good idea! It keeps me coming back...although I would still be coming back even without it.
Idea: There’s a hot potato that explodes at the end of the session and whoever has it has to pass it on. Maybe the person with it has a side effect like weakness or blindness
41:44 the issue with this series is how long it takes to become yellow. Without becoming yellow quickly, not much agression can occur making this series feel like normal survival with a twist
Grian I hope you see this: you have a skeleton spawn egg in your inv throughout the episode. How???!
51:02 The bridge to death ratio is 4:5
13:30 it’s like being in Minecraft beta!?!?!? EVO anyone.
think everyone forgot how much burning flammable bases happens in the life series😭😭😭😭😭
46:00 lmaooo
:)
The issue with the wooden bridge is scar may come and start burning bridges
In this episode everyone turns into goats for a while 🐐
33:30
53:54 grian’s first kill 😂
11:44 you can hear Grian get flashbacks to Third Life XD
42:45 😂😂😂😂
Broken bridges don’t bridge-mumbo 2024
Loved the episode even the episode "destroying" mining trip
The Spanner would be the german word for peeping tom :D
42:45 JIMMY MY GOSH 😭
Ok, right.
Hmm grisn at start of session be like:welcome back back
for some reason I always confuse Mumbo with Scar
Petition for this to become a like real survival world with the mod in without the limited lives. Idk about you all but I wanna see them do this more!
I just thaught what if there was a wild card that makes it so you can uncraft things
This wild card gives me an idea for the last wild card in the series, it could be just switching through all the wildcard that were used before but just all in one session, could be funny
they should be called the high guys
Spanner?!??! PLONKER?!? This is a family friendly channel Grian! Shame!
24:50 mumbos cream was hilarious lol
"hahahahahahahahaha ahahaheheheheheheee" i am here for that 😂
This wild card is dedicated to all the people who have ever looked at a rock and wanted to eat it
42:44 Grian your laughter is so contagious, my cheeks are hurting now.😭
I think they should add a word to their name every session so that at the end of the series their name is just ridiculously long and random lol. “The Sub One Floaters…”
Wildcard Idea. It's nothing but the players don't know so everyone spends the whole session trying to find it out. I think it would make a brilliant episode with them all not being able to work it all
It seems that mumbo has never tried sweet berries before  (10:40)
Mumbos Wild Life first death 🤝 Scars 3rd Life first death
Can someone tell me why the default fps for this video was 230?
42:47 jimmy 😂
yay, new seiries
Name suggestion - a slight contraction on Gems idea. I think Bridgiots would be very fitting
2:30 BRO HOW IN THE WORLD DOES GRIAN HAVE A SPAWN EGG below birch logs
19:43 grian is getting more unhinged
Thought theyd go the route of making a new name every episode then adding something related to that episodes randomizer to their base Questionably small bed space a bunch of bridges etc
Idea: when someone dies the one with the least amount of lives gains a life. To maybe even out the scores :)
Fun Fact: Spanner(s) actually means stalker(s) in German 😂
I think a waterfall behind the bridges would look really good. The sub ones/the floaters/spanners are so chaotic!
People randomly floating up and falling way in the background throughout this video has been my favorite  Really adds to the atmosphere
As much as you joked about that ban, from every perspective that was pure bad faith Wouldn't have been against it  PS: appreciate the reflection and just in general owning up to what you've done, genuinely good and respected
The reason “spanners” is bad besides the obvious is now all i can think of is badger spanner, joe’s wife
Wildcard idea: You gain the properties of non feral mobs that you kill. Also all animals, regardless of their traditional habitats can spawn anywhere and everywhere.  If you kill a sheep: some one can right click you with shears to shear your armor off. Cow: RC with a bucket to get mysterious milk. Horse: RC and ppl can get on the player’s shoulders. Same with donkey, mule, llama, and camel. Chicken: you lay eggs every so often and get slowfalling. Squid: you can only survive under water. Same with fish. Ocelot: super swiftness. Cat: zero fall damage Wolf: can only eat raw and cooked meat. Pig: slowness. Turtle: incredibly slow on land but fast in water. Along with extra air bubbles. Dolphin: Insane speed in water and will eventually die if not in it after said period. Extra air bubbles. Polar bear: strength II Frog: jumpboost, slowness. rabbit: jumpboost, but vulnerable to fall damage. Panda: can only eat bamboo, gets sick with nausea every so often. Fox: jump boost and swiftness. Bee: if you hit someone, you receive poison. (Or you just die)  This could stack, or each effect replaces the last but you lose all effects if you die.
35:22 *Bread Bridge will remember that*
Wildcard concept: nothing actually happens and everyone is trying to figure out what happens
Hey, floaters is better than Axis mumbo😂
I’m dying of laughter from BDubs straight up begging for subscribers
Kind of up for this series just being the crew doing random nonsense and building stuff.
Having scar as a neighbor includes hearing a scream and watching him plummet off a cliff in a “rollercoaster”
i feel like when one of you go rogue, they will literaly burn some bridges
Skizz not suggesting the team be named "The Planks" was a missed opportunity.
42:45
You three are now the Bridge Club. You even meet once a week to play your game 😂
42:47 he has a spawn egg?
at 8:03 I actually pressed my tab key and I was so confused how the server list turned on
You need to get the frost walker enchantment and get Tango!
“Can I use and enchanter for my new stuff, I ate my old stuff.” 😂🤣😂
When a build is so bad it breaks Mumbo… 41:16
15:18   AAAAAaaaaahhh Grian: EEAT!!!
dont starve together mfs:
Jimmy: Hey by the way if you eat my balls... Mumbo: Gladly
grian: welcome to wild life, where we gave everyone 6 lives so the season lasts longer :) grian: releases the zombie plague episode 2
They got realy british at the end there.
33:30 OH NAHH💀💀
Gotta say, bold move to shift gears and make this an a-bridge-d series.
Wildcard idea: ur keys do the opposite things. E.g. w is backwards, s is forwards, a is right, d is left, space is crouch, shift is jump , left click is place, right click is attack.
Wildcard idea: all hostile mobs become charged creepers. Alternatively, all mobs are armored or have increased health.
34:47  what could be worse than having Scar, the one person who kills people gor nearly no reason, living above your base, practising with minecarts that land vERY close to your base, and also has a reputation board with your reputation set to 10/100
40:10 I love it
The bridge boys🤑
15:18 “Eat, Skizz”
Does mumbo also have an waffle on the back or has that just always been there?
Guys please subscribe
Skizz’s screaming frequently fading in or out of hearing is the reason why so many more games should have proximity chat.
12:16 “I definitely have a better than a 10 out of 100 butt”
Is the next episode going to be unabridged?
I screen shot skizz's fall to the ground and he was like 1/4 of a block from slapping into the dirt. Seriously insane ahaha
imagine your floating around with dirt blocks then all the sudden you see the food is going to be randomized
44:57 Very safe... with flammable material.... right.
Loving the teamup!
am i the only one who thinks they should be called “The Bride Buds” 👇
I'm greatly worried about the flammability of most of the Spanners base.
13:27 grian got hungry so he could eat the stone shovel and then forgot to eat it
LOL 42:45 is soooooo gonna be in an out of context video!
Thought about your request for ideas last week. Wild life can have a wild card from previous seasons. Example. The boogie man, random missions with consequences, randomly linked to another player. Etc. etc.
Wildcard ideas 1.) Random blocks... when you mine a block it could spawn any other random block so you could cut a tree and the first block of wood could be  grass 2nd block is stone 3rd block is lit tnt 💥  so noone knows what they would get  Wanna make it more annoying  randomize what the block is placed as so they have stone in hand and 1st block is water 2nd block is bedrock 3 rock is a creeper 💥   Idea 2.) Every x amount of mins all block in inventories/chest will change to any other random block in game the amount of chaos people whould have 😂😂😂😂😂
not Grian eating red dye and gaining loads of hunger from a really accessible food source... 7:12
30:29 Grian is really embodying Abigail from Stardew here.
Joel's Base is so carismatic.
Spanners because they got low attention spans
54:12 In a way, this actually made the series feel more fair to me.  I have been fearing that your being the admin might give your team a slight advantage because you know what the wildcards are.  The fact that you being distracted with admin things also killed one of your teammates--I feel like that, in a zany way, adds balance.
There should be another set of bridges that somewhat intertwines the others so when you walk around your base it looks like a corridor from scooby doo
Here me out they should be the bridge bios
you should put dribstone uder the meeting room. oh and you could explode down under the bridges and make more bridges
Watching random other people doing their things in the background is quicly becoming one of my favourite things in these videos.
Your bridges are lacking a considerable amount of bread.
As an American, what???
30:30 IM IN SO HARD
Wildcard Ideas:  - you'll have a soulmate like in Double Life however, this swaps between players during the session, if you do not find  your soulmate and stay within x blocks you will both start to lose health. (makes people have to interact a lot more) - tools and gimmicks swap functions - things that should harm you heals you. mining must be done with the wrong tool, jumping up takes damage, falling heals etc.
Group Name Idea:              The Bridgers because of the bridges.
floaters eating logs.... come on now... xD  ok ok grain's 'eat this' got me to tears
I love the previously
Eating well, or hardly eating?
this episode is the freakiest grian video i have ever watched
grian exasperated that scar was building a roller coaster as though he and mumbo weren't just building multiple bridges to nowhere
2:31 grian has a spawn egg????
i feel like it would be really funny if the wild cards didnt run out and just stacked each week, i feel like it would get really chaotic really quick. or maybe a future wildcard has all the previous ones active
31:33 Tell me I'm not the one who heard an awesome punchline in their‽
Jimmy's balls are the best food source. 🙂‍↕️
“This is the most bridge I’ve built in third life”  Me: “BREAD BRIGDE”
4:48 mumbo did what now
Hear me out.. how about randomized inventory space??😮   As soon as the wild card is picked, items speu out of peoples inventory. And every few minutes, it randomizes again!
Bad boy bridge
The life series is just becoming more and more messy with the builds  Third life: pretty builds Last life: mostly pretty builds Double life: some pretty builds but other chaotic ones Limited life: mostly chaotic builds but with some pretty ones Secret life: a couple pretty builds but some odd ones Wild life: car. Bridges? Birds
you missed out on the name “fantastic floaters”
38:32 I love how you can just see Mumbo realise that Tango killed Skizz and then start chasing after him, it looks so funny lol
i HERE by name you the bridge boys
The Spanners: The Sub-One Floaters. And Grian: No1. Plonker for not saving team mates.   😬👍
Instead of having a consistent name I think it'd be a fun bit to rename yourselves based on the wildcard
I have an idea what if they build floating islands with bridges connecting them and making a water fall from them to get up and down
21:43 how did grien get a spawn egg
I guess you could just change your name every episode according to what the wild card is. Lmao.
RE ADD SOUL MATES AS  A WILD CARD. THE PTSD WILL BE FUNNY
43:51  Just needed to point out the waffle on Mumbos head
You probably can see each other invisible because you're all part of the same "team". I'm just guessing that you're using the "teams" feature to set the name colors to green. And since you're all green, you're all on the same team. This might also be problematic if someone chooses to play with wolves.
Bridge club
The Poppins Party should have been a name option
This episode was absolutely hilarious. I didn't realise that watching creators running around trying to figure out what blocks they could eat was something I needed in my life, but it really was. The chaos of this series is such a joy.
mumbo: we've made no progress because of this wild card grian: *goes off and makes progress* mumbo: why would you leave me
You should build platfoms to the side of your bridges made from a blast proof material so you build TNT cannons on them and places to drop dripstone from
Y’all are not real Minecrafters unless you’ve done a dirt cluch
"Let's eat dirt, and make our way up the mountain." - Grain, 2024
Not grian being apart of the bridge boys and saying "I don't think there has ever been a base with more bridge!" 😂😂
Build the bridges back to connect with the mountain & build little places, one on each level & share until the team dissolves then you can each claim one.
you could name the base The AntHill because you started small and now theres connecting bridges (and potential tunnels)
Lmao Jimmy with the dirty mouth 😂
From Bread Boys to Bridge Boys, what a great evolution for Grain.
42:46 that is definitely going into one of those out of context comps
Shouldn't you be, The Bridgertons
I sure hope the Floaters win this life series! Go Floaters!
I  am in so hard  Uhmmm grian what you mean
40:53 no one realizing that skizz built it fine but Grian was the one who blocked it when he built the path to the second bridge
this wildcard was insane!
19:11 what if you guys had a new name every session, like a running gag
42:46 Jimmy’s moment of realisation of what he said is just 😬😅
Wild card: SCAR CANT DIE. He dies, everyone loses a life!
"because broken bridges... don't bridge..." 😮 🤯 -Mumbo for Mayor 2024
Wild card idea: once every 5 or so minutes, every player receives a chorus fruit effect. Maybe they teleport right next to where they were, or maybe they teleport under ground, or into an enemy’s base if they are snooping around outside.
Grian only likes this base so much because there's no back he has to finish
Grain put down water under the bridge just in case no deaths 😂
Loved this episode! One of my favourites❤
yall are too nice to each other
idk if grian is accepting ideas like past life series, but i have a cool one! water does damage like lava, and lava does damage like water when drowning people would forget all the time about water and it’d be hilarious. plus good mining opportunities in lava!
“Oh sugarplum fairy!” Grian, being a strange British boy
This video feels like a cry for help 🤣
It would be funny if u added a bridge every time someone dies and name it after the player and their death for example: Skizz’s Starving Bridge, Mumbo’s Falling Bridge. And by the end of the series the base would be covered in bridges.
them starving to death infront of grian (creator of the rule) is funny 😂😂
Grian- we can get stuff done today!  Also Grian - let’s fly around doing nothing 😂
Skizz 24:33: I am flying too close to the sun, Icarus
Grian 15:22 I’m Mary Poppins Ya’ll!
The number 1 transportation this season: dirt LMAO
43:21 top two a-? (I'm sorry)
39:13 not Grian trying to ban tango 💀
Sub-Ones to Floaters to Spanners. It would be hilarious if the team name changed with every wildcard.
U need to make a spanner manner banner
Bridge bois🤩
episode one: smol Episode two: hangry 🍽️🍽️🍽️
Them: BONE MEAL BAD BONE MEAL BAD, WHITE DYE GOOD WHITE DYE GOOD
Idea for a wildcard- Every mob will attack you if you hit them. Ex: if you hit a horse, it will attack you. If you hit a chicken, it will attack you and won’t do as much damage. For normal hostile mobs, they won’t attack you unless you hit them. So this is kinda an advantage and a disadvantage. Hope you use this! ❤
"that's like being called a plonker" mumbo dismissing "floater" lol
That bridge is going to burn by episode 5. 😂
Mumbo "should we put something underneath it like a dangly bit?" How about clay balls?
ITS A TRIDGE
Grian had the brain cell this episode I see
How did grian get skeleton egg?
this session was cursed watching everyone eat non-food things, and panicking over the hunger. i loved it lmao. poor skizz though, this wild card definitely took its toll on him LOL. already a lime green spanner. i can't wait to see what chaos ensues next time, what all wildcards you lined up for this series. it's been a blast so far and we're just two episodes in!  also im sure you get comments like this all the time but i just wanna thank you for the work you put into subtitles grian! whether you do them yourself or have someone do them for you, as someone with poor listening comprehension sometimes and just being mildly hard of hearing, subtitles are my best friend and i adore the way they're done in your videos every time! not only do you have subtitles, but they're color coded and still labeled with everyones name and all, and it's really nice the sort of effort that goes into that and it helps me a lot personally, and i'm sure helps a lot of others too. thank you!
29:03 everyone better start drawing grian with sugar plum fairy wings
2:23 the two cherry trees lookin like snail eyes
I think it'd be pretty cool to see a 'random jump height' for every player that changes every few minutes. The heights going from half a block to many blocks.
Grian could've make it so that the wild card was random everytime so he didn't know what card was active... this way he could have a closer experience to the other...
8:03 Skizz faint scream is so funny xD
Okay but hear me out on this...  THEY SHOULD BE BRIDGE BOIS
I feel like they're going to do something with health for the 3rd wild card
Wild card idea, water and lava does not exist. Fall damage doubled
Whenever I hear ”Mumbo Jumbo“ I think of the one from banjo kazzoie.
With mumbo's death, grian is also saying "eat this" without gibing him anything for a while 😂
Skizz crying while falling back down. I love the perimeter voice mod😂😂😂😂
Skywalkers
Somebody should tell mumbo a spanner is a creep in German
I'm pretty certain the food tab does work, it just included any suspicious stews
Why did grian say I really like your skin as a hint
Im wondering if dandelion suspicious stew would give you food regardless
30:00 why does he just have a skeleton spawn egg???
you should build a bubble colum bettwen the bridges and then when you get to red just make it a trap so you can only go up with the stairs
The Bridgers.
42:43 definitely gonna be in the out of context video
The Spanners need banners ASAP
it would be really funny if instead of replacing your group name with the wild cards, you just keep adding on to the name (i.e. - sub one floaters) and it just ends up getting hilariously long
grian conically having access to creative
Totally stealing saying "sugarplum fairy" when something lit happens 🤣🤣🤣
I think I remenber a base with more bridges, the weird egg base when grian hade no friends. (in limited life i think)
If you want a name idea it could be the less then one brain cell group
26:47 "The real risk in this one, is that ya eat yer sword."
This episode was a wonderful insight to what it would be like if Minecraft players had pica 😂 🤣👀
Wildcard Suggestion: Every so many jumps a player makes their jump height doubles. The only way to reset it is to die
Someone's definietly going to fall through of those trapdoors leading up to the meeting platform.
41:38 I wanna say that yes it does feel like that. I think the reason is that the only suspense/harmfulness can be technically controlled and become adjustable…maybe if there was a bogey man or something it would add a little more edge.
Team up with Marten and  Rendog
I watched scars vid and he was stuck in the caves for half the vid it was just a coincidence
42:49 “by the way if you eat my balls…” JIMMY NO
Great video grian!
This is not a very interesting twist to me. My first thought was "really?" But okay fine. Then it happens again when the food is randomized. People running around with their heads cut off to figure out what is food is fine ONCE, but then they have to do it several more times? It is like the whole "Aha!" bit from season 2, only instead of it being just some players you have to deal with it from EVERYONE from ALL PERSPECTIVES. Which if you just watch the series from one perspective then it might not be that bad, but I typically watch about half of the perspectives. Watching everyone freak out in more or less the same manner about the same uninteresting problem is boring to watch over and over.   Thinking ahead, what I expect Grian has planned is that for the last two episodes is that every previous twist will be rotated being in use over the course of the series and that multiple Wild Cards will be active at the same time. That could go quite interestingly, but it could also go poorly. If that is the case, then prepping everyone on how to figure out what is food so many times in one episode should be seared into their minds so that they will better roll with it when that Wild Card comes about later on in the series. Which justifies doing so mulitple times in THIS episode, BUT that doesn't make this weeks videos any easier to get through.
Totally missed the opportunity, "Can't mend a broken bridge".
15:15
this is where the random items as food clips come from wild card idea: place a block every 5 seconds or draw a 5
is there going to be  a new hermit craft video soon? (no hate just wondering!!)
If I had a nickel for every time grian built a bridge as a base I would have 3 nickels which isn’t a lot but it’s weird it happened 3 times.
Group name idea: Bridgerton
I absolutely LOVE how everyone at the third iteration is like "DON'T EAT ___" really adds up to the paranoia hahaha
I feel like this is gunna be a short series
4:50 I JUST ATE MY SEEDS ---Mumbo JUMBO, 2024
12:24 Scar would tho. I️ remember there was a Phasmo stream where he spent a good chunk of time taking pictures of the rest of GIGS butts
"stop moving YOU ARE STRESSING ME OUT" is one of the most relatable sentences ive ever heard
What about the bad boys bread bridge? 35:20
As always the life series is absolutely epic! You’ve done such a good job at creating it and coming up with new ideas to keep it interesting to watch and hopefully super fun to play   I hope your all having a blast 😁
2:43 is that a spawn egg in your inventory?
I watched Mumbo first and it's so weirdly funny that Grian wanted to build their base out of pointed dripstone to look like a monster face knowing that by the end of the episode everyone had eaten it all.
I’m kind of worried as I watch this season that Jimmy isn’t going to be first out, what are the fans gonna do when that happens…?
Name Idea: since you guys really like to mess around with the wildcard gimmick you could name yourselves the wild willies.
You guys should put a big waterfall behind the bridges as some back up safety and it would also look really cool. Also if someone stops liking the name spanners (which they shouldn't its a great name) you could name your team as something to do with the waterfall.
cant believe mumbo and grian made me looked up what spanner and plonker means
21:31 This is why mumbo is paranoid
i cannot wait until Grian starts another war
This is one of the best grian's videos ever
Ooo I have an idea Every ten minutes you swap places with a random person
If you go at the time stamp 42:44 someone says something
Spawn egg at 45:10?
The name spanners realy fits, cause youre all tools
you should be the sub 1 floaters, then every session you add an adjective based on the wild card
This season is gonna be so short-
I remembered "previously on ninjago" 0:00 😢😢😢
The bad boys had more bridges
34:05 "Dude, perfect." Say that again?
15:16 I DIED. 11/10 scrram from Skizz   😂😂😂💀💀💀💀
Jimmy got an out of context clip entry
Grian’s wildlife season’s base being made of bridge is just another limited life base… I love it xD
"by the way if you eat my balls.. wait"  -solidaritygaming, 2024
This is wild!
they should change the name of their group based on what wild card thing the session had
"Im in, im In so hard already"  -Grian
Who tf is the sugarplum fairy?
33:30 i dont think this needs explaining 💀
Is it just me or did anyone else see a face in the bridges? Typical Grian building 36:26
45:40 The fact that the trapdoors leading to the meeting spot have no safety net below is a HUGE opportunity for assassins
Hey I got an idea one of the series you add a bunch of fans to it to play with or smth?
Everytime you eat your gravity becomes random so if your gravity is too big a one block jump may kill you or if it's very little you fly of for a lot of blocks
I hope mumbo comes up with a new name every episodes, floaters is hilarious. Reminds me of when the knights who say NI suddenly changed to the knights who say eke eke eke f’tang lol
2:32 Why does grian have a skeleton spawn egg
This series is incredible! The sheer chaos every time the food randomised again was hilarious to watch, thanks so much for making this series! It’s getting me through my exam year ^-^
i like my stone drippy bruh
The spaners sound like the spaniards, like in the conquistador's who enslaved the Inca Empire...
It was such a chaotic episode, my face hurts from laughing.
25:58 you missed the iron grian!!
4:49 Mumbo: "I just ate my seeds" your welcome
“Wanna smoke?” Most British thing grian has asked mumbo
the difference between this, mumbo, skizz and pearl's pov and gem's or joel's is crazy....
When they start blowing up everything, Joel’s car is gonna be the first to go
a grian video can't be a grian video if jim doesn't say something out of context
grian - "where did everyone go?" skizz - "AHHHHHHH"
Imagine the finale is every wild card combined
Idea: You can only breathe when in water. Normal air suffocates you.
This hole video is just grown men playing with their food
Sugar plum fairy
On one hand people are struggling to survive. On the other hand people are getting high from dirt.
49:52 as an American your naughty words sound absolutely ridiculous, these aren’t English bad words so much as just British bad words       *and yet y’all (as in the British y’all rather than the Hermit y’all) throw around c//t like we throw around f//k* - *things I learned from watching Tommyinnit and co*
How about every session you add a word to your group name? Current name: Sub-1 Spanners.
Sub1 still fits because yall got less than one braincell 😂
Why not change your group name every session? 😂😂😂
Why does mumbo have a waffle?
The bridges remind me of mumbos season 8 hermitcraft base
Wild card idea: every mob drop is randomised 🦐
PLEASE wear spanners. PLEASE
wild card idea: cartoon gravity: You can walk in the air unless you look down.
If I was on wildlife I'd have one mission: eat a netherite block
at this point you guys should just be called the indecisive
Spanner in german is like a weard kind of Stalker😂😂😂
Grian on 6 - Mumbo on 4  - Skizz on 3
What about hermitcraft?
“By the way if you eat my balls” “BAWKEJRHHEHWEHWHEHEHEHAAAAAA”
i still dont get why people dont use helmets
grian taking ownership for mumbos first death is making me think this will be another desert duo moment where grian becomes extra protective of mumbo lmao
this was such a fun wild card :)
Floters are the best 😂
who else saw the spyglass and had to hit ah ahaaa
Beans
I had an idea of the base. How about you guys dig holes in both sides of the bridge then make those rooms and then make slopes that lead up to more bridges and keep doing the same thing untill you run out of bridge room
OMG 2ND EP ALREADY UPLOADED
35:30 Bad boys bread bridge?? 👀
36:45 It seems there was a SPANNER in the works 😂
YES GRIAN  We lost the essence of the series! Where is the conflict? The wildcards are fun and all, but all of you are dying because of them, not because of each other.  This feels like a completly different series
Omg this episode was so chaotic XD Loved it!
This is Grian's playground season.
i really want to see them play moded minecraft, ice and fire, maybe some techno mods for mumbo the red stone man, just see that
15:54 modern retelling of Icarus and Daedalus
yall sould add a plugin that makes it so you guys can sit and lay would be funny
I wish that the wild cards stacked
I hope one of the wildcards later on is randomized hitpoints. Imagine being at full health and hunger and then all of a sudden 4 hearts is full health instead of 10 lol. I bet with playtesting they could have figured something like that out. Idk how skizz or jimmy will survive it but....
The 4 bridges lived in harmony until the Tango attacked
the babysitter curse strikes again
26:18 is no one going to talk about the skeleton spawn egg in grians inventory
Name idea: cliffhanger’s, because of the hanging bridges
Mumbo: suggesting Spanners as the group name  Every german speaker: please nooooooo
Grian is missing the point of these series, it's not about progress, but about quality time and fun shenanigans
cant wait to see the angst about grian being so caught up wacthering ( which is often the fannon for when hes doing admin stuff) that he let mumbo die
where's the Boogeyman
Grian really doesn't like to share
Grian: Noo!  Me: You made this bed of Wildcards. You now sleep in it.
So good of Grian upon discovering two decent food sources to give Mumbo neither. He's a real one.
34:15 , the person just falling in the background, right after mumbo fell? hilarious
"I can't think of a base in the life series that's had this much bridge" mate the entirety of Limited Life was just bridges
grian not realising that resistance 4 from sugar makes him immortal xd
Wild card idea: Some people can’t place blocks, some people can’t break blocks, and it changes at regular intervals like the food thing
You should definitely be the sub one floater spanner’s
33:22 so they also have some spawn eggs? like loot from chest i guess?
WHY ARE YOU NOT CALLER THE BRIDGERS!!!!!!!!! 😂
The Sub-1 Floaty Spanners
Shuger plum fairy is when you get diamonds 💎
the tri-bridge feels like the return of the stairs from secret life
mumbo and skizz are gonna die first, calling it
Idea for next life series: Hidden life: everyone gets a random amount of lives(3-5) that wont be seen by the other players. So you can lie about the amount of lives you have left or be honest but no one will know for sure excepts you're self. Also every episode 2 players will have a chance to steal another players life for yourself (that player will see that their life has been taken but wont see who did it) if you complete a very hard task like defeating the wither or a task like that.
29:22 is giving “we have concepts of a bridge”
Group name idea: (It's unconventional but with this crew that just makes it better) Add to it each episode based on the new thing Eg. So far it could be the Sub One Floaters and next episode add to it.
21:58 Grian: "You want a smoke" 😭
a new film coming soon "The Bridges of Spannerton County"
wild card idea: every now and then you switch places with another player without any warning anybody(. . . countdown) you can only attempt to kill another player with the swap if you are yellow or red. you can also make ajustments if you want:)
42:44 💀💀💀
A Spanner is the german word for Voyeur. Pick up your spyglasses
magic mountain wild life edition
You should be the Phoebe Bridgers 👀
BridgeY boys
37:51 this looks like movie scene 🎬
Grian you were a bit of a spanner for that bonus clip
i think the size change from EP1 should've been permanent for the rest of the season
I can hardly believe it, but somehow, Skizz has become worse at the Life Series than SCAR. Think about how death-prone you have to be in order to achieve that status, and how lucky you are this isn't a 3-hearts series, man! lol.
Limited Life: Boys Bread Bridge  Now: 3x Bridge on walls
spanner’s don’t break bridges because broken bridges don’t span
I love how this week’s wildcard introduced the server with the concept of doping
who is the sugar plum fairy
Wild card suggestion: players burn during daylight like aggressive mobs
Watching Joel/Gem and then watching grian is like 2 wildly different experiences.
mumbo is so hostile this season so far its cracking me up lmao
35:21 what about bread bridge in limited life? That was a lot of bridge lol
Me amd grian were about to throw hand GRIAN WE NEED HERMICRAFT PLEASEEEEEEEEE😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
42:44 - 43:13 is such an amazing interaction🤣
26:47 how does he have a spawn egg?
I loved when Jimmy kindly told mumbo about a good food source. Such a wholesome moment 😔🙏
The funniest thing about this is Skizz' voice fading out as he drifts away...
Grian can you build on the next Hermitcraft season a mega base like season 7?
Should be able to gift lives 😂
sub 1 floaters
The "Magic Spoon" sounds so much like a drug, especially the way they talk about it in whispers XDDDD
2:00 - Grian hovers over dripstone Me having already seen Pearl's POV - ah yes food
Floaters is bad, but it’s still better than when BDubs and Mumbo almost called themselves “The Axis” because they were building their houses on different axises
group name idea: just add on every episode. the sub one floaters spanners
The Gem and Joel alliance idea is great
Is this subtle hints at what game Grian is gonna play next with a group of friends??? More iconic duo: Grian and Don’t Starve Together  😂😂😂😂😂
The spanners is such a good name for this team of geniuses :)
woa the nausea actually makes me ill
it took me so long to realize the jumbo joke
33:39 spawn egg in inventory???
Do you know what this needs? A BRIDGE REVIEW
The way deaths are coming in this season i don think it will last more than 4 episodes
33:27 "im in so hard already" - grian 2024
i'm being a nerd here, but that car looks like it is based loosely off a dodge charger/challenger
it'll be great if the Floaters all get frost walker boots and once tango is in the air then they can quickly equip the boots and get him hat way.
no way this is 5 on trending
This entire video had me laughing so much but Jimmy saying "By the way, if you eat my balls" had me CRYING
13:19 BETA REFERENCE- EVO!!
this gimmick's way better than the small thing, it goes so deep, has so much opportunity for death, it's way weirder, this is so cool 20:38 GOSH not hating on the small thing, just saying that this series has already had a huge jump in quality for the better
are these bridges also justa. decoy?? always a good season when a bridge is involved!
The floaters is great since the seem to be changing base every episode 😅
Just came from mumbos vid and the while they started building the bridge I was thinking you gotta get back and help
Mumbos name of "The floaters" is very accurate since 2 of the 3 members did die a gruesome death
Please keep these long episodes coming!! Absolutely loving it!
PLEASE keep your inventory clean it really hurt watching it
About 18 minutes into the video, why did you have a skeleton spawn egg in your inventory?
the name should be paranoria cuz yall were so paranoid last ep😂😂😂😂😂
for a group name my first thought went to "the Tollmen" cause.. idk,, tollway,, bridge,,, toll men on a bridge, or if u could be the trolls,, cause,, trolls under the bridge
I think the reason the invis dosnt work is because you are all on the same team(the same name colour) you can fix this with a setting using the team command
I ATE MY SEEDS - Mumbo
Names for a floating group Skys high. Floating Boats, Cloudy crew
BREAD BRIDGE 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
16:38 pov:- skizz is that one child who wants adventures 24/7, mumbo is the careless brother, laughing at skizz and grian is their mother, insulting and grounding skizz lol
20:50 i dont know why but i sorta want an animated bit just for this. Mumbo shouting "YOU DID THE COMMAND" and the screen turns to the *SUPER LORE GRIAN* with like 50 wings and at least 10 eyes floating around him saying "no i didn't" 😭😭
I would've loved to have the size reduction from the last episode to last for the whole series 😢
I want hermitcraft now Grian.
Idea: Make lava into water and water into lava
Mumbo:Spaners DocM: Please Nein
can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars 47:09
anyone else notice the spawn egg in Grians inventory at 47:34
How I imagine ancient peaople found out what food is good lol
"I can't think of a base in 3rd life that had this much bridge"  Meanwhile Bad Boys Bread Bridge 😢
❤❤❤
I think 1 way that you could have balanced the wildcard system (i.e. Make so that grian isn't the only one that knows everything) is to give everyone a wildcard lexicon and make the wildcards randomized. Maybe you could make it where you have to identify what wildcard is in play by reading the lexicon to identify the symptoms and remedies (kind of like phasmophobia). idrk though. It's late and I couldn't get this idea out of my head.
Pearl ate her diamond sword as she died
The name should be the bridgers.
9:17 "I'm oozing, I'm oozing, Sorry I'm oozing all over the place" Mumbo is crazy for that.
Honestly I kinda like the gimmick of the group changing it's name every session based on the wildcard shenanigans
19:44  Skizz: Well I took off my clothes! Grian: Well I would put them back on mate
Guys please don’t be the spanners. If you say it in German it’s another word for creep. A person who… well watches people while there… private. Oh no
No Mumbo... "The Floaters" kinda... Stink... XD
I think they should just keep adding to their name as the series progresses, so rightnow theyd be the sub one floaters
Wildcard idea: you crouch, you levitate
"stop *MOVING* MUMBO YOU'RE STRESSING ME OUT!!" -G "i have health boost 3" -Mumbo i dunno why but this moment was so funny to me lol
23:55 i can already see this in an edit called "Hermits out of context"
It was too late yesterday so I couldn’t watch the whole live stream will the whole stream be up on VOD or?
He said that he doesn’t think there was a more bridgey season but he forgot about potato pier and bread bridge and the skynets
what's that spawn egg you have at 47:35
16:10 ok so at first i definitely thought skizz *DID* hit the blocks because of how close he got but i slowed it down to x0.25 speed and bro he was like a centimeter away from hitting that dirt block😨
Group name idea: I suggest it should change everything episode to fit the wild card of the episode
I love these videos so much 😊 thank you
The pleural of floaters is 'a clog'
Still going strong!
37:33 the birch planks strike back from Lizzie's vid😭
Some things would need to be altered, but in a theoretical season 2 it wpuld be funny if the wildcards became permanent, purely for the chaos
35:46 you are forgettin scar's base in the 100h hardcore, all bridges
35:21 "i cant think of a base thats had this much bridge" bread bridge? the egg? skynet? i think you might be destined to always build bridges, grian.
33:25 this was a dumb bit. Got me in tears 42:45 NOOOOOOO LOL😂😂😂😂
spanner is stalker in german
Damn was not expecting this to be an hour long when I just clicked on it 😂
Instead of Sub 1s they are missing a golden opportunity to change their names to the Sub 2s as in "Subscribe to".
Whenever you come up with a new name each session, just add it onto the original until its ridiculously long at the end of the series(like Sub One Floater Spanners)
Not the pica episode
The amount of people asking about the skeleton spawn egg in the comments
Did you just get Sleep Dreams? Wow. World record for not getting it.
This episode is mainly about keeping Skiz alive lol
what happened to hermitcraft?
why aren't you using bundles?
31:55 the unbreaking sword is painful to the eye :')
Wait wait, did you say you like Mumbos skin because he is Zombie-ish? 😮
I was just thinking about how weird is it that the whole of the Wild Life map is probably smaller than the Hermitcraft shopping District. Really makes you realise how small it is.
Skeleton spawn egg? In inventory
mumbo shat out a silverfish lol
This episode drove me crazy from mumbo’s pov. Just absolute chaos
11:00 Dune Mentioned
grian playing with ppls food torturing them with effects dude . . . . . . . . . .<in grain voice >MORE!!!!!</in grian voice> haha best season yet
"Spanners" had me so confused for a second. Before I remembered what the English word meant, I was thinking of "Spanner" in German, which means something along the lines of "Peeping Tom"
u should change ur team name every session depending on the twist it would be real funny
wild card idea: all the crafting recipes are randomized, but they change from 20-50 min, randomly and this would be funny, or have a random block become a giant chance cube
Grin craft some bundles (leather and string) and organize your inventory
Grian threatening to eat the chestplate made me so uncomfortable I had to skip ahead until it was over
/ B A N
🙂👍❤️
Wildcard idea: every few minutes, 2 players are chosen at random and swap places via teleport.
Considering the "Sub 1" and "Floaters" pattern, I think it's best to be called something like the "Variables" - the team whose name changes according to the wild card of each episode.
if i was playing in this series i would be far too distracted by the wild cards to actually make progress
EP 1:Small thing BIG things  EP 2:Mukbang
EAT THE BRIDGE!!!!!!
Grian out of context - "I'm in so hard already" 33:30
Mumbo: "We could be The Floaters" Grian: "Stop trying to make The Floaters happen. It's not going to happen."
42:45 well that was a cut
The diamonds in that dark section of cave seemed to really pop o.o
Why the Life series always remind me of adult swim? No matter what pov i watch. I love this.
You are now officially the wrenches congratulations
42:43 I WAS SO CAUGHT OFF GUARD BY THAT THAT'S GOING IN THE OUT OF CONTEXT VIDEO AND IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE THAT MUCH CONTEXT TO BEGIN WITH
I'm watching grian to get rid of my sadness from max getting KO'd for the first time 😢
The spanners are so close to the cherry grove group that I wouldn’t be surprised if they just merged eventually. Especially because it’s only episode 2 and it already looks like skizz and mumbo are getting taken out of the series soon.
ee
Spanning the sub one floater
Grian laugh never gets old, so glad he kept the Jimmy clip, he usually cuts the less PG things from videos
this episode and the comments about bridges had reminded me how randomly obsessed grian has been with building bridges and it’s HILARIOUS
33:30  "Im in so hard already"   Calamity clips, you know what to do.
the floaters xD
I guess Grian is the sugar plum fairy now
This makes me thoroughly concerned for how chaotic the wildcards are gonna get and I see the need for six lives
Wild Card idea: Each set of armor causes different effects. The better the armor, the worst the effect (this is non-damaged effects btw). Possible examples could be: Leather gives regen, Chain gives saturation and night vision, Gold gives strength, Iron gives hunger, Diamond gives slowness and/or weakness, and Netherite (which I doubt one can get, but who knows) gives blindness and nusea. Again these are just examples  These also can be benificial as you can stack armor. So if you have Leather, Gold, and Chainmail you would gain Saturation, Strength, Nighy Vision, and Regen
Ep 1: Mumbo's paranoid  Ep 2: Skizzly is paranoid  By the Rule of Shared Braincell, Grian will be paranoid next episode
Just so you know, in German, 'Spanner' has a different meaning—it actually refers to a voyeur, someone who secretly watches others.  So....
Ssundee: cobblestone is life Grian: eats cobblestone me: grain takes cobblestone is life to seriously
32:21 grian turned into RCE for a moment
'Floaty Devotee' would've gone crazy 🔥🔥🔥🔥
The sub one has earned one sub.
Wildcard idea, mobs drop random blocks, and blocks drop random mobs.
Best life series yet ❤
How does grian have a spawn egg at 31:16?
I feel like they need a new name for every episode at this point
"we all float here you'll float too" quote from IT
Well I officially dislike Tango.
loving this series so far, its so much fun!
Wild Life Wildlife
will you bring back bread fridge
Those bridges might burn later on... I'll bet on it
Where’s hermitcraft you my main hermitcraft source
Wildcard Idea: Make ALL the MOBS have the Ability to Teleport
42:50 bro I can’t with Grians laugh “AHAAHAAHEEHEEEE
Grian why do u have a skeleton spawn egg? 21:14
Bread bridge still wins in my book.
Loving the longer videos! Always a great watch! Keep up the good work!! ❤
41:30 he has a spawn egg A SPAWN EGG
i feel like the last wildcard should be all the wildcards combined
18:51 "The Up-1's"  32:10 The return of bread bridge
one things for sure, the animations of this session will be interesting
2:47 it’s funny how nobody noticed the flying person in the background on top of Skizz’s head 😂
Honestly, I think this would have been a lot more fun if the food didn't shuffle again. It could have been great having each teams experimenting with what does what and actively making items just to eat. Could have made for some cool strategy
When mumbo said wooden shovel i just remember ina and biboo saying wooden shovel 😅
Organize your hotbar
sub-1 intelligence lmao 😂
Stone shovels, "A DELICACY!"
I personally feel like challenge should be different for each people, that would have played into repayable value
This haz been one of the most stressful videos for me
24:04 I love Mumbo's positive outlook about what y'all achieved, that feels like hard won personal growth.
What about bread bridge
Mumbos hair isnt gray in this series
Because of their neighbors (Scar, Lizzie, Jimmy) one day they'll definitely TNT minecart them or lava their bridges😭😭
Wojack: I watch the life series for content  Gigachad: 42:45 I watch the life series for these moments.
Idea for the final Wild Life session; combine all the Wild Cards that happened previously into one super chaotic finale.
43:01 “i bet” HELLO??? 😭
I love how Skizz's gag reel has permeated the Hermits and now they've all got bonus clips and things at the ends of their videos. 😂 Also, Grian needs a suit and red tie so they can all be The Suits.
Top shelf
46:02 I thought to my myself "wouldn't it be funny if the food got randomized before they ate it"
Jimmy's out of context fandom is going to go nuts. Also a spanner is a tool so calling someone a spanner is like calling someone a tool
And in this episode, Grian, Mumbo and Skizz build a model replica of Cato Neimoidia
So this is hilarious, right at the part where Mumbo was saying the team should be called the Floaters, I get a notification for Mumbo Jumbo "Wild Life Episode 2 - Floaters" 😂 perfect comedic timing.
Wild card idea : Wild fire  •Every 5-7 minuites 10 flamable blocks are set on fire •Too put out the fire you must scream near it (you decide the range) (whispering doesn't count)
Grian why do you have a spawn egg in your inventory???? 🤨
15:20 I'm sorry but that drive by scream.... 😂😂😂😂
Hey your name should be the random cards because each session has a different wild card and you guys find something random to call your selves
26:19 what's that spawn egg doing there grian
At 10:45 in the video Grian has a spawn egg.
The most hysterical duo is really mubo and grian 3:38
Okay you should be called the sub one floaters and each episode you all come Up with another name to add to your name to make it longer and more ridiculous. So like week 5 you could be the sub one floaters bacon pie spannertime roasted pencils or something else equally stupid.
What if, and hear me out, every episode you all just add another name to your group. For example, you guys can now be known as the Sub One Spanners rather than just Sub One or just Spanners?
42:47 i kid you not i laughed so hard😂😂😂😂
I hate the car too
Can’t wait to see what happens next
4:48 Mumbo: I just ate my seeds! 😭😭😭
I love that Grian's gonna burn this series to the ground over a car 🤣😭
Bread bridge supremacy.
I absolutely love the life series
this episode seemed like grians worst nightmare 😭
"I'm in so hard" 33:30
"something about dripstone just fills me up" IS CRAAZY (26:25)
“i’m in so hard already” buddy 💀💀💀
45:25 I haven't seen Mumbo's Ep yet, but if this isn't an intended pun, it's a fantastic accidental choice of words.  "If you died again, I wo-, I-, you'd be; de-spanned!"
Due to the mild nature of the premises and as well as the extended amount of lives, I thought this would easily be the longest series.   After this episode, I have now seen I have misspoken.
I feel like tango should have a life taken and given to skizz as a punishment for rule breaking killing.
41:38 no, trust me grian, this is one of the most essential parts of the life series.
I love how long these videos are getting, There's so much more to enjoy and very little is cut out without problems!  Plus we get to enjoy more shenangigans!
*Wildcard Idea:* Mob eggs start spawning randomly, with the mobs they spawn NOT corresponding to the eggs' textures. When there are more red lives around, the more fun this wildcard would be. :)    *Variation:* Bundles of mob eggs of the same type spawn instead of individual mob eggs, but don't make them spawn too frequently. This would be fun as well because then certain teams would have different advantages, and combat would be very interesting. :)
31:31 STRESS
They should come up with a group name for each episode and always change it per episode
*bread bridge flashbacks*
*Me:* Where's Jimmy's POV? *This Clip: **42:45*
42:26 That threw me so off.
42:45 now THATS going in the out of context! I had the same burst of laughter as Grian And then a back to back clip with that one and 43:31
If the boogeyman isn’t one of the wildcards I will be severely disappointed
I’m waiting for “Mr mumbo, they hit the second bridge”
A new name each episode! LMAO I love it!
call yourselves Airheads
Grian: doesn’t like spanners Mumbo: bridges span things Grian: I’m in
35:20 i cant think of a base that had more bridge in the life series................ bread bridge in limited life
SKIIIIIIZZZZ
*Tango dies* Happy accomplished noises
“Because broken bridges, don’t bridge”  - Mumbo Jumbo 2024 50:34
Wildcard Idea: Weird Weather. The effects from rain, snow, and thunder are all active, and everyone's render distance is reduced to 2 from fog.
Wild Card idea:  Every time you craft an item, a dripstone spawns above you and tries to fall on you.
43:22 talk tuah
Why did grian have a spawn egg?
We used to have boatem. Now we have floatem.
4:48 "I just ate my seed" -mumbo 2024
Grian: "I think we're going to get something done this session" Also Grian: Just eating dirt
alternate title: Skizz, Mumbo, and Grian struggle to make progress from getting high
Imagine if these wild cards were prototypes for future series gimmicks. Like the large/small thing comes back next season and it's called "Larger-than Life".
Wow this episode of Dungeon Meshi is wild
"I cant think of a base in the life series that has this much bridge" *gets flashbacks to the wooden stair incident*
Bring back the boogieman 🙏
43:20 say that again?
16:45 bro measured how far from the ground he was💀
Language, Jimmy
The last episode should have all the previous effects combined, or something like that
42:45 "hey by the way if you eat my balls" that is definitely one of the quotes of all time
The group's starting trends here
Poverty in a nutshell
I see you’ve teamed up with the guy who always dies second and the guy who always dies third. I hope you know what you’ve gotten yourself into here Grian
This was not video worthy….
We need match for the kids series again
1:27 theres somwthing about Grians deadpan nonchalant delivery that just makes this moment stupidly hilarious
4:48 “I just ate my seed” -Mumbo Jumbo
Skeleton spawn egg?
Grian I want you to know even if you might not see this that every time you put out a video it brings me joy in hard times but this not mean to pump out videos every second because knowing that you happy makes all of us happy‼️
Scar calling Mumbo “Mumbo Butt” and not “Mumbo Bumbo” is absolutely despicable
32:23 grian and mumbo are just like 100% on the same wavelength and totally vibing with this silly bridge idea and skizz just sounds absolutely baffled at this moment and it is SO hilarious to me. i feel like he is truly realizing what he's gotten himself into LOL
The residence four is invisibility as each level gives 25 percent damage reduction so 4 levels equals 100 percent damage removal
Did Mumbo always have waffle hair?
The bottom of your house needs more drip stone.
Why don’t you have the armor mod on?
You should make a cherrywood bridge!:)😊PLS
Sub 1 floating spanners
43:21 brainrot sleeper agent activated. Tawk tuah was said.
Neighbor's car an eyesore? Is your immersion being ruined? Time to throw a spanner in the works ;3
Okey the “S” on the base looks more like a Z
I see. The wild card is Africa mode.
35:56 MUMBO SWEAR???? 😨
8:08 barely starting and whomever was that floating up, sent me 😂
The food tab actually did work just the "food" that you guys were making were potions that count as food items
The fact more builds rather than murder can easily be solved by bringing back the boogeyman
The last session should be all the previous wild cards all at once.
WE PLONKER!!
Shenanigans are indeed afoot!
Broken bridges, lead to broken Skizzes
31:39 Skeleton spawn egg?
42:45 JIM WHAT THATS GOING IN THE OUT OF CONTEXT😂😂😂
Ya'll need to make bread bridge 2.0 lol
Wildcard idea: You must be within a certain range of someone or you get poisoned (could also be to stay away from each other)
i wondered at the delay, and sheer panic in your voice when i watched Mumbo's POV.  thanks to the bonus clip it all makes sense now. Grian was caught slacking. ;)  (probably typing the command to randomize the food again, LoL )
Idea: random noises play that only each player can hear so everyone has scitzophrenia
I honestly don’t mind watching Grian mine Especially because of him saying the suger plum fairy is funny
4:49 "I just ate my seeds." - Mumbo 2024
WIld life Episode 2: Grian, Skizz and Mumbo become self-proclaimed tools
Looks like dirt got them high
You guys should be the Spoons. Mumbo is a well known Spoon. Skizz is a less well known but equal Spoon. And you're a Spoon for teaming up with them 😂
I don’t know if you do it on purpose, but I sort of appreciate how this season you’re one of the last to upload your perspective. Because I know almost everyone watches your perspective first
Almost an hour long I'm so tired
From all the perspectives I've watched so far, Grian and Mumbo were the first to suggest they should keep food information to themselves. Everyone else was just running around helping everyone else.
I wonder if this works in real life?
yaaay🎉🎉🎉
42:44 “Eat my balls” is gonna be in every Out of Context compilation and I’m here for it 😂
Hey grian, ik there is no suggestions for wild cards, but what if in the future, when alot of wild cards have happened, a wild card could be is that everyone gets a previous wild card permanently or it could be for 1 or 2 episodes.
Dripstone Doritos
Bring back bread bridge.
And on this Wild Life episode the wild card is just The Great Depression
"hey by the way, if you eat my balls" –jimothy solidarity, 2024  (42:45)
Ironic Mumbo and Skizz died immediately even thier teammate is Grian 😂😂
Wild card idea Bring back double life and have you linked to another player
9:22 my favorite part was when Mumbo said its oozing time and oozed all over the place
Imagine if Scar is the last one alive.
Should make 1 bridge for every life lost
35:22 Grian I will answer ur question and the answer is bread bridge
the fact that Mumbo's idea of a replacement for the name which only lasted one episode was another name which would only last one episode
loving the longer videos, these series always go so fast so its nice to have probably around the same amount of episodes but at a larger scale
39:26 mumbo is UNHINGED this season i love it
I just had a great idea, new name for the group, THHE BRIDGE BOYS (a reference from a long time ago when Grian was in a group called the bread boys)
Always excited to see a new life series episode!!
This series will end next episode at this pace lmao
Your base should be called “a bridge too far”, not just because of the pun, but because of the implication that TWO bridges is not too far.
What timmy said was crazy
Wildcard idea: It's like freezer tag and double life mixed together. Each player would be paired with someone else and if their partner gets hit they get frozen and the other partner has to hit them to unfreeze their partner. xD
You guys are going places. Not to the end of the series, but places.
I'm calling it. This is Mumbo's season.
grian just incase, watch ya head! itd be pretty easy to drop dripstone onto you if you're on that bridge
A boogyman is need to not lose the essence of the series
I think Grian gave too many lives to everyone i mean 6 lives are so much
33:30 "I'm in so hard already!" 💀
I really hope that every session the base changes as well as the team name according to the twist of the session and how they use it
BRIDGE BOYS
I just want to say, when the TNT minecarts start rolling, you're living underneath the guy who will be rolling them.
Wait if Grian and Scar are so close together, does that mean Desert Dou might be in this series?
team subspanfloaters is comedy gold, but im definitely forseeing a friendless grian moving in with etho again within the next couple episodes, haha
BE THE BRIDGE BOYS👹👹👹👹
Damn, was kinda hoping you were gonna keep the sub-1 base and just use the trapdoor to enter the base and keep living in it constantly crawling. XD Oh welp, back to the video, the new base will be cool too, I'm sure.
Grian is not escaping the bridge phase lmao
I don't know why, but the line, "Broken bridges don't bridge" brought me to tears 😂🤣 50:34
29:54 im not sure if you are supposed to have a skeleton egg ??
Suggestion: This group should change their name every session.
So yall know spanner also means flaw
I think the grian/skizz/Mumbo team should just keep changing their name each time to match the new wildcard. The sub 1 club, the floaters, what's next? Who knows!
Oh my god I just spewed my coffee all over the place! "Hey by the way, if you eat my balls" coffee everywhere. Oh the humanity! PS you should tottaly be "The Jeff Bridgers"
You should have called yourselves troubled waters. It doubles as incorporating bridges and  water like the water buckets you plan to use all series. That way it could stay all series long if you want.
10:22 that's so funny knowing that he knew things were gonna change
Episode 2 summary: everyone develops Pica
The life series is so much more interesting when theres twists and wildcards. Secret life was my favorite, but this might just be better. I am loving it!!
The animatics are gonna be amazing for this
"Are you gonna eat that?" Is the essence of this episode
28:28
Y’all should be called the Bridgets
thankyou for this joke 42:45 you made my day
Grian, I've got a possibly new wild card: vein mine if crouching. Might not be enough on its own, but could result in big surprise self-spleefs.
So far this season is very different
I pledge my allegiance to the star spanngled spanner.
Where is the boogeyman?
"the real risk is that you eat your sword"
Grian's inventory gives me anxiety
Grain keeping mumbo from starving while mumbo panics reminds me of them playing don't starve together, and I love it.
Jimmy gets so angry when he's taken out of context but there's no context for that. He actually just said that..
The food being randomized is kinda anti-game design tbh I think it would be more fun to find and discover what each new food does instead of it being taken away from you
They should be called the bridge boys now
resistence 4 makes you invincible btw
50:06 grian has the “plonker” pass?🤨
Alright just wanted to put some future Life Series suggestions out there before i forget them in a minute 1) Sky Life - Life Series but Skyblock, pretty basic but still wanna put that out there 2) Lava Life - This one is a fun one where everybody would have an Elytra from the start attached to their back (extra difficulty would be to also use up the Chestplate Slot), every session Lava would rise higher and higher throughout the session so that eventually 2-3 sessions in most of the world would be covered in Lava forcing everybody to have to build up in the sky and rely on their Elytra skills (maybe do something funny and increase Elytra damage) or trust that they have enough blocks to get around (maybe in later sessions the lava stops rising and instead lava starts pouring in from the world barrier forcing people close together) 3) Moon Life - Literally just Season 8 of HermitCraft but in Life Series, throughout every session the Moon will get bigger and cause earthquakes and antigravity 4) Lucky Life - Something with Lucky Blocks, like every session your given a few lucky blocks, maybe the lower amount of lives you have the luckier the lucky blocks are with your first few being unlucky ones, maybe also some kind of punishment for not opening them as well 5) Fools Life - normal 3rd life but it takes place in an April Fools Update version of minecraft, maybe which version it is changes every session 6) Chained life - Similar to Double Life but instead uses the Chained Together Addon to lead two or more players together (maybe changes each episode to make it more complicated if need be)
I absolutely love this trio. I cannot stop smiling throughout this whole episode even though HALF OF THIS EPISODES FROM THIS EPISODE ARE FROM THE SPANNERS oh goodness this is an absolute joyous mess. Thank you grian, for another great series, and only 2 eps in <3
8:08 Etho just floating in the background lol
Y'all are the sub one spanners so far
"Hey btw if you eat my balls" - SolidarityGaming, 2024
Here’s an idea randomize amounts of damage taken falling 50 blocks takes away 1 heart but maybe falling 5 blocks will take 4 hearts but it can’t be more than 7-8 hearts as a max
Skiz is trying to break scar’s record
grian really climbed that mountain like hes a sardaukar
=)
I came up for fun idea how about instead of items kind of slowly getting pulled to you. You get pulled towards items. Some sort of magnetic pull and push certain things push you certain things pull you for example, maybe tough pulls and it can change your orientation so that your feet are on them and  you and you can run up walls
Wild card idea: similar to double life if you take damage/die someone else takes damage/dies instead of you and it switches throughout the session. The amount of chaos that would endure would be beautiful
Donkey Kong base!
43:20 why did i hear "talk tauh"😭
41:10 “I mean the good news is that is- I mean I don’t want to say anything too _mean_ about it.. m-maybe….. one of the w-maybe. One of- maybe. Maybe- one of the wor-“ “Maybe one of the worst things ive ever seen in my entire life”
Group name for next week - X-Spans.  Thought of a trick for the next series. +1 Life.  each week, something is added but nothing is taken off.  ei episode one size. next week, stuck at that size and something else alters.
SKIZZ
36:21 “Big up yourself, all day everyday”
grian mumbo and skizz almost eat white powder and float...
😂 😂 😂
37:37 “Don’t- do not- DONT eat birch planks.” Literally all of the Spanners: stop and look for birch planks to eat
sub one is the best nameeee
24:50 HUAUAAaAAa 👹👹
I like sub 1 club. I think it'll stick. But if it doesn't, I recommend the Gimmick Gang.
Previously, on Wild Life. GET OUT 🗣️🗣️🗣️‼️‼️‼️
Grain is the goat
Bridge boys was such a missed opportunity
Death is going to be rampant this episode I reckon
so episode 1 was being really big or little, now this episode is everyone eating stuff, did Grian set this up for the most chances of inappropriate jokes as possible? "Our shaft is really small" "hey by the way if you eat my balls" HRMMM
I just wonder when there will start to be two wildcards at a time.
Okay hear me out, you should call yourselves...  The cliffhangers!
Bridge boys!
MSG!!!  A great name!!
Skizz not getting british terms is revenge on him for him and tango using older american phrases to mess with jimmy when llaying plate up
Who’s watching in 1945?
42:45
25:00 why is there a random spawn egg in Grians inventory? HMMMM? And why is it a Skeleton spawn egg?
Bridged boyes team bridged boyes
Remember Scar in 100 hours Hardcore and all the grief you gave him for living on a network of precarious bridges…how the turns have tabled.
Grian messing around with eating the diamond chestplate gives the same vibe as those old "boint gun at benis" videos
Grian: Mumbo youre the most paranoid man i know   Mumbo: SO YOU'VE BEEN MEETING OTHER MEN????
I can't wait for the movie of this to come out You will be able to see all of the different wild cards going through
I love the difference between this group of ppl vs joel and gem trying to discover what is good food LMAO
Sub one floaters
Grian... you never fail to surprise me with ur exclamations xD "oh my sugar plum fairy"
Spanners is great but it would've been hilarious if they just changed their group name every session lmao
almost an hour long video!!!!! I love long vids thank you grian
I love how upset Grian is over Joel's car man I thought you were family..turns out you're just friend....
You, Mumbo and Skizz are such a fun group! We already know you and Mumbo have a great dynamic, adding Skizz in adds in so much chaos!
Your group should be called the sub one floaters and then every new Wildcard u add something so that eventually its real long hahahah
16:39 "you will never feel that high again skizz"
Wild card idea everything you mine drops something that is not at all the thing you mined
just saying its a pretty burnable base and I think we know the record yall have with bases made out of burnable items and i cant wait for thing to get crazy I love this series so much
why does mumbo have a waffle excuse me
You should just add on to the group name with every session so like the “sub one spanner floaters club”
15:15 “wait where did everyone go?”AAHHhhhhhhhh
Wild card: boogeyman ….
I think jimmy might not be out 1st/2nd thins time guys
21:28 I’m wondering that too but it’s even funnier that it was such an intense scenario editing grian had to mention it too
Good video, but what's up with making fun of Joel's car. It's a very good car, and he worked hard on that.
25:18 why when grian said "bucket" did it remind me of boris johnson saying "blue 😭"
Damn there isn’t a boogeyman in this series 😢
Wild Card Idea: You teleport randomly every 3-5 minutes
If i had a nickel for every life series where grian's base was a bridge, id have 2 nickels, which isnt a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice.
yippee
Scar's reputation board is 3rd life all over again😂
Sugarplum fairy… my daughter can’t stop laughing! 😂
We love YouTubers that take ownership of their mistakes! Absolutely love that about the hermits!
Wildcard idea (when red appears): Everyone gets a random crafting recipe that allows them to activate a specific wildcard from the previous episodes on themselves for a period of time.
Also what is it with Grain and bridges??😂😂
Randomized crafting is an idea, not sure if its a good one. But it's an idea.  Another thought would be playing with the number of hearts everyone has, maybe increasing them the fewer lives someone is on and decreasing them for people with more?
Hear me out ya'll build bridges up and down and have a toll or... Riddles, thus the trolls.
I love how Grian's group was so much utter chaos when they were scrambling to find things to eat, while Joel and Gem's group was like "Yeah, we've got all the food we need. We won't be starving anytime soon."
Not Scar saying gross when Grain said Skizz will change to lime bc he’s on 3 lives So mean🤣😭
E
If you look at the 3 bridges everyone of them kinda look like one of the members *the bottom brigde kinda looks like mumbo* *the middle bridge kinda looks like grian* *and the top bridge kinda looks like skizz* 😭
Can’t wait for low life in 3 months.  No regen at all
Okay so the Spanners are just Bad Boys II: Badder Than Ever (at living) I can already see the tragic arc of Grian being the last one standing YET AGAIN
Weekly life series videos HECK YEAH
Wild Card idea : (Potentially Deadly) Creepers no longer exist, instead there is a set chance that all mobs have the potential to act like a creeper but still keeps its skin and model (You may change the idea prompt)
Is keep inventory on?
Ah yes, the Sub-float Spanners, I knew a college band of that name
35:17 PLEASE all i could think of when you started building the bridges was calling your base ✨bridgeton✨
A BRIDGE TO HEAVEN!!!
Dirt eaters.
@8:08 whoever is floating up in the background added so much comedy to this clip for me 🤣
Group Name Idea: You may no longer be Sub-One, but if you want to keep it short, you could still be The Abridged.
is there keep inventory on the server or not?
You should make one where creeper spawns are buffed and basically silent
Yall should be called the bridge club Have a whole episode dedicated to playing bridge lol
New group name  The bridge gang
Eating everything makes for a lot more comedy than I would have thought.
Wild card idea: MOON BIG
Caseoh update:
"I just took off my clothes."  "I would put them back on mate."
42:46  so getting clipped and put in a out of context vid
The “food” items in the crafting table that gave effects might have been suspicious stew variants.
This episode was hilarious! I was losing it the whole time!
grian uploaded a new wild life ep and it’s almost an hour long? hell yeah
Is anyone noticing the monster spawner egg at 10min in
There going to become “The Bridge Boys”
Lmao
... Grian just has a slight advantage over the wildcard information?
Sub 1 Spanners!
tHe SugAr PluM faIRRyY 🤣
I feel like you guys should own the Sub-1 name.
Wildcard Idea: "Zork"- Lose health at low light levels!
#5 on trending for gaming on 10/26/24, 7 hours after upload
I like the new thing, but the wild card tends to dominate every episode of every participant.... makes it more of a mod reaction ráðherra than 'life series' episode. Hope it changes overtime.
"It's like being in Minecraft beta" Grian says right after they talk about the stone shovels being unstackable food items
33:30 "Im in so hard already!"
I'm sensing a pattern
As my father would say: Spanners? More like Tools
38:16 skizz be "gomen amanai" Xd gojo things
I think the size mechanic from the first episode is actually a decent idea for a whole life series. Idk episode one was just SO GOOD and I love that mechanic a lot
4:49 mumbo: i just ate my seed
33:29   I know one thing that's going into the out of context video.
Randomizing the food sources is CRUEL
grians outburst of laughter never get old😊
Excited for the moment when they decide to burn bridges between each other
music is a bit loud
The great famine
39:10 /ban Tango
3 deaths from one and 2 from the other Grian needs some new teammates
This wild card reminds me of Tarrare😅
you guys should be called the sub zero floaters/spanners, adding a new adjective each episode. 😂
*Jimmy “By the way if you eat my balls, nah I mean” *Mumbo “Gladly”
15:16 skizz scream fading as he falls down is hilarious and then 42:45 when jimmy says "hey by the way, if you eat my balls" and grian just DIES laughing i literally died with him laughing so hard
25:58 there's some iron in the top right corner, dunno if it'll be there next session but it might be worth checking!
42:45
42:45 that's gonna be in this week's highlights
Petition to make the first two episodes not count toward the death tally
Gamer
Idk about y'all but I vote for the "sugar plumb fairies" or "sugar plumb fairy boys" (SPF or SPFB lol)
I like the names changes, it reminds me of the bandits from Home alone with how the tall one would change it to different names with a new gimmick fitting them.
They should have added the boogeyman back because the series is progressing WAY slower
21:27 it was the greed... the greed Grian!
42:46 Golden moment
42:45. you're welcome.
Take a drink every time you hear the Minecraft eating noise and you will be dead in 10 minutes
Can’t believe they forgot bread bridge with their base to bridge ratio
LOVE the longer episodes
wildcard idea  more achievements you have more hearts you have but all achievements reset at the beginning of the wildcard
Nobody is going to get anything done in this series  and I'm so here for it
There’s no way I just watched them build the most TNT-minecartable base in the entirety of the life series
"If you eat my balls- wait" -jimmy 2024 😂😂
26:26 I like my stone drip bru
Grian says that the first rule of being a spanner is that you don't break the bridge. Last Life connection anyone? [Timestamp: ~50:22]
You should be the Sigmas Skizz i Grian Mumbo a
Happy to see that Grain also thinks Mumbo saying "Get out, you big oaf!" was the highlight of their last session hahaha
Wild card idea: all attacks explode. So punching, hitting with tool, and even arrows all cause an explosion. That would cause people to have to avoid fighting monsters and could lead to some wacky situations
Did anyone else notice that Grian had a (Skeleton?) Spawn egg for the whole session? Im not sure if i forgot something from last time or not.
Your going to look like the Scooby Doo gang running back and forth on those bridges 😂
13:21: "it's like being in Minecraft beta"
Grian: I want a water bucket for emergencies.  proceeds to walk around with an empty bucket forever.
Nah they aren't the spanners, they are the spoons 🥄
"The Sub 3 Spanners"
Great video lol, the wildcards have been really entertaining
I was gonna watch this like. A few hours ago but got distracted by mcc so I’m watching this now, yay
44:53 people don’t normally own up to murders mumbo
The length for these wild live videos is so great I love the longer videos
i love how you gave everyone bucket to fill it with water  *BUT NONE OF YOU FILLED IT*
Mumbo: literally starving and on the verge of death Grian: why don't you eat this untested food that could make literally anything happen?
I need @realcivilengineer to make some bridge reviews 😂😂
does this mean that Grian has..... an IRON Gut??? 😏😏😏
44:02 2ND BREAD BRIDGE/ BAD BOYS MENTION IN ONE VIDEO. LETS GOOOOO
46:10 they wanted to get high so bad 😭😭😭
88❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
33:48 you can see some people falling from the sky at this part asckdnsnackn
The absolute chaos of this episode after watching Gem's much more chill session where she and Joel found good foods almost immediately and were never in any danger. Perfect contrast.
Grain is gonna have a new team by Ep 4 if Skizz and Mumbo keep dying like this
Sorry why does Grian have a spawn egg?
35:24 bread bridge and the egg
42:46 omg, the sheer glee in Grians laugh here is amazing. And Mumbo running with it… 😂😂😂
Off to a strong start
35:29 Bread bridge/ Bad boys flashbacks😂😂 (my fav group in the life series)
They should add some bubble elevators that look like they lead up the bridge but just explode at the top
"sugar plumb fairy" best words I've ever heard
Wild card idea: every time someone crouches, someone else gains a random effect.
i can't think of more bridge, sky net/ bread bridge in limited life, and the egg mess of secret life
not only did you not give Mumbo the food you had verified was safe, you proceeded to consistently give him untested food.
you should bring back the boogeyman
I would put a plank out from the bridge and push tango off of it 😂
38:01 - Man on the Moon reference.
16:08 Skizz just did a dirt clutch
GODDD I LOVEEE the wildcards!!! They’re so so good and so fun!!! This one was HYSTERICAL, omg I can’t believe so many people died… it was wonderful :D and like. Honestly I kind of like that Grian (and Grian alone) knows what the wildcards are - it adds a layer of fun to everything :3
43:21 “the top tuah”
i was really convinced this notification said “eating WALL!” for a minute
In German "spanner" has a very different meaning.
Ooompa loompa doompa-dee-doo, Mumbo died of hunger and Skizzle did too. Ooompa loompa doompa-dee-da, if you stop eating dirt, you will fall far.  What do you get when you eat random blocks? The hunger monster looms, on your door he knocks. What you gonna do when they come for you? Build another bridge like the Bad Boyz do
The sugar plum fairy🤣🤣
wasn't expecting so many stoning references tbh
Idea - swap lava and water, but have them the same texutre, so whenever anyone taks a dip in the ocean they get burnt, only way to douse is through lava
Wildcard Idea - water getting changed back to pre 1.4. need deeper water the higher you fall
14:17 imagine seeing these guys just floating across the server tho
Wildcard idea: the number of slots filled with a full stack of items in your hotbar is your max health
50:00 Ah yes, being a wrench (spanner) is the worst thing a person can call you 😂
I have a feeling that they are going to change they're name every episode
2:53 why the sky look like walls OO?
Terraforming the natural environment is wild
Please release on friday
34:52 Scar just being Scar😹
They are summoning RCE with the near propaganda
ok ok ok wildcard idea, morph everyone into a hostile mob and get rid of name tags for the episode
this video was very british
loving it, but nothing beats action, later you should make every enderman spawn a whither skull
42:45 “hey btw if you eat my balls- no i mean-“ 42:55 “…gladly”
Erm stone shovel?
THE BRIDGE BOYS
eat my ball was crazy 😂
You’ve made my day with this upload Grian!
Sad that nobody made the enterprising decision to open a pop-up diner to provide folks edible foods
16:00 This is it!!  It’s going to be the EPIC moment of the season!!!!  Way to go Skizz!!!!   Pass it along to Skizz!!!!  Dude!   Epic!!! Epic!!! Epic moment!!!!
I am loving the Spanners, so many laughs from you three. You guys should definitely teach Skizz more British terms.
whjy is keep inventory on?
42:42 “ by the way if you eat my balls.” We all agreeeven grain laughter
44:35 MANIFESTATION AT ITS FINEST!
I feel like the creative mode feel is because you guys have a lot lower stakes than last time  Also the lack of a boogeyman might be a problem
wild card idea1: they ALL TURN INTO MOBS wild card idea2:all prviose wild cards are permanit
3:27 that synced head turn is so funny
Grian making a bridge out of wood. He makes bases with wood every damn time. We all know how this will end
29:01 "That is one kitted out sugar plum fairy boy" -Grian 2024
41:11 "That is. . . I mean, I don't wanna say anything too mean about it, but . . . m-maybe. . . one of the . . . may-maybe one of the . . . maybe --"   "Just say it, Mumbo. Let it out."   "Maybe one of the worst things I've ever seen in my entire life." 😂😂
this group is peak comedy, rock bottom efficiency
I replied on Episode 1about the Deja vu and how I think they’re doing this on purpose. And I actually think they are
This episode was AMAZING ahahahhaha
Mumbo jumbo’s aggression in episode one is probably cause he’s not used to be short and wasn’t prepared for the amounts of condensed rage that come with it. As a tall person, he’s never handled the fact there’s more anger per cubic cm the smaller your body is. In this essay I will
i love how they keep running into people traumatized by what the things they eat did to them
Isambard Kingdom Brunel has already built a three bridge base. What a bunch of copycats.
42:45 PEEGEE!!!!
this is probably the most unhinged life episode ever and thats saying something
Grian has too much power. Next thing we know it'll be "Minecraft BUT a RANDOM MOB spawns every ten seconds"
The next wild card should be different mobs getting Phasmophobia mechanics.
"That is one kitted out sugarplum fairyboy"
Grian and Mumbo sharing one braincell is very relatable.
22:04 AHHHHH! IT'S SOOoooo much more powerful then the dirt!!!
For the episode 3 wild card you should bring the boogey man back for 1 episode but everyone is the boogey man
I don’t know what it was about it, but I just burst out laughing when Grian turned around at 44:54
6:44 this gives me the same energy as that scene from the office where Dwight starts a fire as a drill and then utter chao ensues 😂
42:45 if you eat my balls “BLA BLA BLAAAA”
No one expects the spanner inquisition.
bridge brigade
You lot should call yourselves “the plummeters”. I mean, you’ve each fallen from great heights and somehow lived at least 4 times each. That’s impressive.
You should put a sign at the table saying "treasure ahead" or "try jump"
I hate to say this but scar has a good spot to bomb your base
Great concept but twists should carry on from session to session
"And by the way if you eat my balls-" got me DYING! XD
💎 Sugar Plum Fairy Boy 💎
22:02 Skizz's voice steadily growing quiet as he floats off, i can't 😂
At this point, the team should be called "The Sceptic" 😅
this man 100% has ADHD
the floor is lava would be a rly cool one
4:48 as a pastime activity perhaps?
I feel like the reason this series has kinda lost the spice it had, is because this series doesn't have the pvp element, or the danger element as much as the last ones. However, that doesn't mean this isn't a fun watch!
8:10 someone floating up in the corner of grians screen 😂
Felt like an episode from limited life bad boys are now the bridge boys😂
It's a good thing you all have 6 lives this time around.
You could Call yourselves SPANiards
Not Grian telling Mumbo what's actually food, then proceeding to let him starve- 😭
As soon as I heard "Hey by the way, if you eat my balls?" followed by Mumbo saying "Gladly!" is the most out of context funny moment right there and im dying! 🤣😂
Every time a spanner dies, build another bridge?
sub two crew
5:12 hollup, Mumbo is onto something "What?"
25:01 Water buckets are honestly the third most important iron item to craft. Shield first, pickaxe second, bucket third, sword fourth
This and Trump v Harris ERB on the same day
girlie what is going on in that thumbnail
Yes I love the life series 😊 second best Grian series after build swap 🎉
Scar's jolly  "I'm building a roller coaster OuO"  Followed by Grian's endeared "Of course he is..." That was so cute and funny
Finally a Grian base he doesnt need to finish the back of
The Boys from Bridgerton
He is NOT beating the watcher allegations
43:22 top two-uh??
heloooooooooooo
BAHAHAHAHHAA THIS EPISODE WAS SO FUNNY!!! i love every episode of wild life as it comes out Thank you for uploading and coming up w these Grian!!!! THE SPANNERS ARE SUCH AN AWESOME TRIO HELPPP Grian you gotta hold these 2 away from danger at all times 😭😭😭
I think that after each session you should add a new nickname to the gang name, so after this one it should be ‘the sub-one floaters’ and then another one gets added next session
Mumbo is definitely falling off the meeting table with how much he moves around idly
PLEASE Grian clean your inventory 😭😭 I can't take another season with a completely full inv
There was a big bread bridge..
Just gonna say, I love the dynamic between the Spanners and the Scar/Jimmy/Lizzie team, the kind of friendly neighbours vibe. I think there could be a bunch of fun moments out of that, even if the reputation board has (or used to have) low scores for the Spanners :D
The wording on "I can type in  B A N" sounds so friendly
Build a bridge outward from the cliff side with support beams under it!
there are three things in life that are guaranteed:  1- death 2- taxes 3- skizz and scar dying in the funniest ways imaginable every single life series
i love the paranoia so much
It’s kinda hilarious that the episode where EVERYTHING is edible has everyone starving to death 😭
poultryman brought me here
Can't wait to see what The Wrenches do next    Also the tri-bridge base is in the shape of a "z" not an "s"
😂
I like how the sub 1 gang started as sub 1 block, but has very quickly transitioned to sub 1 braincell from all the dirt😂
hear me out, you call yourselves the Bridge Boys for this season
10:03 "my stomach fell"  dont worry, so did everyone else's
What is this seed? I really want to build your base is. I had an idea for a mine shaft.
12345
Can you do a wid card that doubles graviity(can only jump half a block and fall damage happens with half as much of blocks and so on
I predict the final episode will involve ALL the wild cards in one go.  As soon as the reds outnumber the yellows and greens, it's ON!
31:01 42:43
Get your spyglasses, "Spanner" is german for peeping Tom. work with that…
Set your playback speed to 0.25 then click this 16:10
Help me make a compendium.   Phase 1:  Dirt: makes you float Sculk vein: food Cobblestone: Nausea  White dye: food Iron Ingot: Food Polished Deepslate: Food Stick: blindness Campfire: Night vision Light blue dye: Jumpy Scaffolding: Food Stone Axe: Blind Wooden Shovel: Haste  Stone Pick: Noise A hard to spell shell: Nothing?  Oak Log: Translucency Grass block: Noise  Phase 2:  Polished Deepslate: Infested.  Oak plank: Poison Scaffolding: Food Dirt: Blindness Raw Gold: Food Stick: Fart power Birch Sign: Water Breathing Birch Slab: Health Boost Deepslate Bricks: Jumpy Barrels: Food Bowl: Long sightedness Pink Dye: Food Birch Leaves: Food Dripstone block: Food Grian's Sword: Risk 100  Phase 3: Dripstone block: Food Iron Boots: Resistance  Iron leggings: Instant Health  Iron Chest: Food Amythest Shard: Food  Phase 4: Moss: Noise Pointed Dripstone: Food Dripstone block: Poison Birch Planks: Floaty  Clay Balls: Food Sugar: Slow falling  Phase 5: Sugar: Resistance  Deepslate Cobble: Food Wooden Shovel: Nausea   Could some of the "nothing" foods have given extra lives?
Knockback II could be LETHAL on the Bridge Base, leave a few gaps here and there and open areas near the rooms etc, and voila, easy doom fall onto spikes.
34:18 am I the only one who saw someone in the distance fall from the sky? lol
it's wild how much food grian still wastes even when food is so limited like this
I was at a sleepover where I got absolutely no sleep when they started being released and that a s super fun Edit: basically I was watching wild life and doing a roleplay and and watching Gravity Falls, it was the best night and to top it all off today was mcc AND the Wild Life series episode 2 came out today Best. Sleepover. Ever, also my freind watcher your vids also and that was fun to talk about it with her, we were up at literally 3am talking on how Timmy is out first every season lol have a great day Grian, and everyone else!
24:37 a mom and dad argue while their adhd child spaces out
Ok what’s with the spawn egg in Grian’s inventory?
33:34 ‘IM IN SO HARD ALREADY’ Dam…
you should do one where if you lose a life, you possess a random mob like and find someone to bring you back
You did great in MCC today.
42:45 hey by the, way if you eat my balls...
mumbo: Broken bridges don't bridge grian: yea umm thats a saying
Wildcard Idea: Poultry Man’s Revenge. All chickens are hostile, doing varying damage from a llama spit to a ravenger. You never know how much the poultry hurts until it hits you
Okay who wants to bet Skizz is gonna die first this season?
Grian comes back and immediately recommends building the next part of the base out of something flammable. Maybe someday he will learn not to build things out of WOOD in the Life series.
Skizz was Half a block, maybe less, from hitting that block😮😂 16:08
Can you, Mumbo and skizz Make a bid base to feel small
!!!!
"The Floaters" as a team name really stinks. 🤣
Here’s a wild card idea what if you have to break a block every five minutes or you’ll lose health
going from the sub-1 club to the floaters to the spanners is PEAK character development
Cus if it’s the same why didn’t they just, drink milk
EP 01: Sub One EP 02: Sub One Floaters/Spanners
What happens if u drink milk?
I watched this already but I came back after the mcc stream heheh!!
broken bridges dont bridge- mumbo jumbo 10/26/24
Love the long video!
Will there be a Bread Bridge?
42:45  AINT NO WAY 😭😭😭
WILD CARD IDEA!!!  Everyone burns in the sun like skeletons and zombies  (And life series rules, they can’t wear helmets)
when does the fighting start?
I’m seeing why this series needs 6 lives 😂
Wild card idea: Every time you interact something like a chest, you get a random item.   Because why not.
Perhaps Mumbo was right to be paranoid of you.
8:01 skizz falling over dead is the most hilarious thing I've seen today
I love the concept for this series!
grian told me to come here, im leaving a comment for the system o7
just got here from the mcc Halloween stream!!!!
I predict that in the last episode all the wildcards will be reactivated.
There's several hints back to Last Life and it made me so happy. XD
had to watch mcc stream first but i’m here now 🙏🔥
Love you G ❤
The reason you could still see Skiz is becuase the team has showFriendlyInvisibles turned on
consider: you change your group name every week to match the wildcard. become ungovernable. confuse them all
mumbo: *actively dying* grian: *clickity clackity this server is my property*
Who else just came from the mcc stream?   Only me…  Ok.
The happiness this series and these people bring me is unmatched!
loved the twist
Just finished the stream lol back to this
A life series and a Grian stream in one day?? Today's a good day
Watching this right before and after the livestream is my personal favourite pass time
This was so funny! Most bridge to base in third life? All i thought of was the EGG lol, Love your content keep it up! ( P.S feel better soon!)
Loved your live stream btw
“Scar what are you doing?” FLASHBACKS
LEAVING THIS COMMENT BECAUSE POULTRYMAN TOLD ME TO!!! 🐔
stream was great !! can’t wait to now watch ur pov of wild life :3
At 13:25 , why does he have a skeleton spawn egg???
So excited for episodes 26 and 27 of hermitcraft! So glad you got to do mcc I really enjoy watching your pov! Hope this video does well
Hope you feel better soon Grian!!❤️❤️ . You did really well in MCC!!
See, now thats thinking with bridges!
Get well sooonnnn
Me, episode 1 of Wild Life: Six lives? This might be the longest season yet! Me, episode 2 of Wild Life: This might be the shortest season yet!
4:05 my fav part
yippiee glad that I'm not tooo late to the vid :D
Grian, Mumbo, and Skizz are just Kermit, Fozzie, and Gonzo
Paranoia might be helpful
love this
I was so expecting them to still be very small that I didn't even process that they were full size at the beginning, it just looked strange LMAO Loving this season of the life series so far!!
i love love love this teamup I'm actually going insane y'all r so silly !!!!
I cannot believe there was 5 deaths in the group in ONE episode. Bonkers
feel better soon grian!!
I see you took advantage of the update that allows you to eat anything
bread bridge, egg bridge, now spanner bridges???
I have some small tips that will make things easier.   First off, call your group the Bridgemen since your base is a bunch of bridges.   The first tip is: Use bundles for the extra stuff in your inventory.   Second inventory tip that I don't think I've seen used on the Life Series: Ender Chest. You just need some obsidian and an eye of ender then you pretty much have an extra inventory.   Since you have keep-inventory on, using the bundles and Ender chest would let you keep way more stuff in your inventory, and you don't have to worry about losing it all.
have no idea what scar was doing but him hanging out near their base, occasionally joining the conversation, and randomly falling from the sky in minecarts was very entertaining to me for some reason
This is the worst season of the Life series so far. I'm trying to enjoy it, but something is just missing. Everyone is fooling around with the wildcards and doing nothing to play hardcore Minecraft. The lack of bogieman doesn't help either.
“Bridges span thin-“  “IM IN”  By far my favorite clip of the 2 episode series so far
Funny enough, depending on when this was recorded, there could have actually been a solar flare during your recordings.
Why did Grian have a skeleton spawn egg?
Potential future title: Wild Life: Episode ??? - Burning Bridges
You should add to your team name every wildcard so for this episode it should be Sub-one-spanners, by the end of the series it will be very long 😂😂😂
Isn't a spanner a wrench?
Dying 3 times in one episode is pretty sad
Yay
How ironic that this episode came out the same day I have a stomach bug, I’ve thrown up twice today  And I’ve lost my appetite for like everything
what happened to the nice subtitles :(
33:29 Grian out of context montage coming soon?
Wildcard idea: recipes are randomized
This content would be better without Skizz, sorry. He drives me nuts!!
This is why the dm should play their campaigns
34:17 Does anyone else see that?
He's green he can't murder
43:21 the what now Grian?
*Wildcard suggestion:* Every block you look at/interact with turns into another block. The blocks switch every half an hour For example: every block you look at or interact with turns into water, and when it switches, the block turns into obsidian
I’d have 2 nickels for every season Grians lived on a bridge It’s not a lot, it’s just weird that it happened twice
Man, what I wouldn't give to take a peek at the data packs the team must be putting together for these wildcards. Every time I see a new mechanic added to the Life series the data pack maker in me becomes so happy.
Da sky bouncers or sky miners
50:40 grian announced the name and my phone instantly dropped the video quality to 360p
Future episode- 100x100 or smaller world
For a wild card idea: Everytime you jump your hight range changes from high high you can jump
Grian: Here's what i can do let ne type /b a n  Hes definitely the best teammate
6:34 grian sounds so surprised yet so unfazed because he’s used to random things happening to mumbo bu this point 😭😭😭
Am I the only one who thought they were calling themselves the "Spaniards" for most of the video? They're British!!
They're bridging the gap
NOT THE: "PREVIOUSLY, ON WILD LIFE." No actually, please don't.
Jimmy’s balls😂😂🤣😂🤣🤣
Is this a bread bridge callback 🤔
I like how the previously on wild life was literally just mumbo saying "get out you big oaf."
I feel we should appreciate how, unintentionally each bridge fits a different spanner’s skin:  Oak : grian Spruce/cobble : skizz Cobble/deepslate : mumbo
oh god
Round 2: The Hunger Games
"hey by the way, if you eat my balls…" "..yeah, continue? gladly" "they’re good, they’re really good, genuinely" "i bet" "no, they’re the best food source" "of course! [eats] they _are_ good!" "they’re really good" "lovely samples"  mumbo can you stop
im oozing all over the base HEY YO what he mean by that
What is up with hostile mob spawn?
I have an idea for a wildcard, if you jump you get a level of levitation, and if you crouch you loose a level of levitation
I love how Grian talks about these bridges as if bread bridge and sky bridge didn't exist in one of the life series 😂
50:34  lol, mumbo
48:10  god if the word "really" was banned grian would be silent for the entire series 🙄
2:25 I predict death  Edit: BRIDGE BOYS
@Grian !!! A wildcard could be that at any random amount of hits taken (ex. If Joel gets hit 4 times whether it is fall damage or a player hitting him…), a player will have an explosion around them. So at random intervals there is like a tnt radius explosion at players’ hitboxs!  love the content pal! ❤❤❤
you just know 42:45 is gonna be in an out of context compilation
14:06 elytra got invented in 2015 People before 2015:
15:16 “aaaAAAAHHHhh”
42:45    what...
Who the Sugar Plum Fairy?
anyone know who they would predict how many sessions there are to make the right amount of twists?
VAGUE S ACHIEVED
Mumbo having so much trouble insulting the car is such a mood
Perdiction, grain will be solo by episode 4
When Grain mentioned a water bucket all I could think of was those yt shorts cuts where the guy tries to clutch and instead eats the bucket
This episode everyone becomes a Goron.
After this series, the next life series is gonna be called tiny life (my prediction)
Ah yes. The bridge boys.
8:10 flying etho spotted
42:45 Jimmy going "Hey, by the way, if you eat my balls - nah I mean.." followed by Grian's hamster laugh is easily one of the best out of context lines I've heard in the Life series. It was so unexpected! xD
42:45 reminded me of when scar said “don’t put that in my mouth” during mcc🤣🤣
An MCC and a life series episode thank you Grian
Call yourselves the Bridge Brigade!
<3
i like wild. nice shot of the skizz landing. crazy rng, but he nailed that stunt. 😄    tech note: the minimal armor resource pack should be on the server side, so... everybody on yt sees the same thing. shoulder pads and boots. and the custom skins, ofc. (shoutout to BigB, pearl and scott) hmmhmm. gotta guess the power of the pants. i can only word it this way. but... it gives it some form of mystery for the endgame. yo. 🤫
The way Grian laughs after Jimmy's line like one of those edited wheezing cat photos.
Wildcard Idea: Acid Rain: every 10 minutes there’s a 5 minute rain storm. If you touch the rain you will take damage
You should make a wildcard where everybody’s voices are high pitched
"maybe one of the worst things I've seen in my life "maybe one of the worst things I've seen" "maybe one of the worst" "maybe one of" "maybe.."
I feel like adding watcher lore into one of these would be interesting
Should someone tell Skiz that spanner is British for wrench (aka: tool)? Maybe THEN he’ll appreciate the genius of the name.
4:50 Me too mumbo, me too
I really don’t think a lot of the people giving wildcard suggestions actually understand the criteria for wildcards
Wild Card idea: water doesnt break your fall
"This may the the record of bridge to base ratio"  Me remembering grian's first base in secret life (a bunch of birch slabs in diagonal upward bridges)
How is Grian's episode longer than Mumbos's if he was mining for HALF AN HOUR?!
You guys should of made a base on the dripstone witha  yellow line like the uk trainsations 😂 also that deips stone already looks like a face  42:51 WAS OFF GUARD
Name idea : ✨The Bridge Boys ✨
when the series ends, please make these datapacks/wildcards publicly available! i would absolutely love to use these in a server with friends
27:54 “oh ho ho the sugar plum fairy”
The bridge boys
Tussia brits slava bratee slav britskk slavasskit roysiaa broyietsea soyvetsky yinss souyz
16:30 PLUS ONE AWESOME
Idea for wild card: Each player is randomly assigned animals with strengths and weaknesses.  For example Horse: Increase or speed and jump height, but can no longer swim.  Spider, can crawl up walls, but can't attack during the day unless hit first(With resets)  Skunk: It is toxic to be around player, but trees and crops won't grow around you either.
Last episode they were short, now they're always hungry... Grian just wants to become a hobbit
Ah good this there was a recap i didn't watch last episode lol.
The way I was feeling a bit sad today and caught myself smiling watching this. Glad Life series is back❤
+ 4 AWSOME
sub-one braincells
Why do you have spawn egg in your inventory 2:44
Bridge trolls ahhhh
Nothing here officer just a couple of dudes playing minecraft  Oh thank god he didn't find the bridges
is this what the hunger games is about?
Why is the video sped up?
Minecraft but everyone has pika
I like sub-1 club the most, since you all have a collective intelligence of sub-1. But honestly whatever you guys like is best!
Grian should give Mumbo a life
Wait... "randomiSed"?
8:05 skizz died meanwhile etho is just floating up there
The suger plum fairy?
Me: Oh they can be the Bridge Bros Mumbo: Spanners
now the yt loading bar is a gradient of red and pink
Proposition: the bridge boys
When are u posting on hermitcraft season 10?
42:45 OMG
9:23 I think I found the clip for wild life out of context 😂
Jimmy: "By the way, if you eat my balls..." Mumbo: "Gladly" Jimmy: "They are the best food source" Mumbo: "Of course~ they are good~" LOL
So basically everyone has pica this session
I kinda wish the wildcards stacked and never went, so we would have the growth thing and the eating thing last the whole series for max chaos
29:30 "Thou is laden with drip".
i don't like how bright the skins look
Sky guys
“Hey so if you eat my balls” by far my FAVORITE Jimmy line 😭 42:46
Sub One's base should be bellow y=1
37:31   Skizzleman:Dripstone is poison i ate it and it brought me down to lik almost nothing and then i starved to death so don't eat Dripstone .  Mumbo:You'll be happy to hear pointed dripstone is good.  Skizz:Oh come on man.  Mumbo:You were so close.😂😂
The Pica episode
The out of context for this session is gonna be crazy
Trippy Grian, Just Trippy
No way your names are related to 💩 floaters sub1s...😅😂
hate to be that person but im not digging the hour long eps. 40 mins of it is just useless stuff and it really doesnt captivate my attention as the old series did...
I sorta wanna try this "Wildcard" myself at some point, it would be nice if there was a datapack already made for it
How was there so much death this session and none of them was Jimmy!?! The curse better get its @$$ in gear or he might actually win this time.
why does grian have a skeleton spawn egg ?
grian getting mad at a car is the funniest thing i have seen in a while
15:35 like the laughing scene from Marry Poppins
I'm betting Skiz will die falling from a bridge
SEE FOOD DIET
3 spanners and 3 bridges Thats 1 bridge for every spanner
Idea for twist: everyone swaps places every 10 minutes.
You guys could just come up with a new group name every session to confuse the others
8:15 looks so funny with skizz just dying and then someone else is floating in the background while grian and mumbo talks 😭😭
The out of context videos are gonna be fantastic for this session xD
The Spanners are gonna last like 3 sessions at this rate lmaooo
Kinda wish there was more traps and war like 3rd life…. Tbh
Wait what happens to hermit craft?
Sub-1 Floters 🫡
Try the name brig boys for the group
Please do a new name each episode😂that would be awesome
18:58 you guys should go with the airheads to stay on theme with the one brain cell that you all share
5:28 he has a spawn egg?
42:45
What other series brings you to the heights of drama while having people eating shovels
I now see why everyone has 6 lives this series.
Why is it that these three can get stuff done solo but when they’re together, they have sub one braincells?
Wild card idea: you can pick up ANY entity. That includes players.
I was starting to think that this would be a long series because everyone was busy playing with the wildcards, kinda like in Secret Life. I see Mumbo and Skizz are trying to prove me wrong
Wildcard idea : inventories and item textures are randomized Or randomizer (as in the sethbling datapack) Or prop hunt (player avatars are replaced by the block/item they’re holding.
HI G4IAN I LOVE UR VIDS ❤❤❤❤❤❤
that is  getting clipped 42:45
Mumbo and Skizz being paired up has amplified both of their goofiness
Correct me if I’m wrong but I don’t think anyone tried actual food as a food source
These bridges make me want skynet back.
Your now the Sub 1 Floaties
Why was this upload so far after mumbos?
42:41
There is something hilarious about them failing to revenge on skizz and moments later the creeper got tango 😂
“The life series is weird when taken out of context”  The life series in context: 42:45
Now they're the sub 1 braincell club
I love how Grian is one of the most PG lifers but laughs the hardest at the suggestive moments
Some time the wild card should be that all previous wild cards are active
Anyone else see someone falling at 34:17
So happy they explained spanner to Skizz bc no way I would have known that
I bet someone is going to start making bridges and they will go to war with grian
23:45 why does grian have a spawn egg lol
Grian’s back must hurt
you caused mumbo to die your such a spanner... jk
This episode was extremely stressful
It would be really fun to see some gimmicks being throwbacks to older seasons, like having a soulmate
I just realized that the group is MSG
fyi "spanner" literally means "peeper" in German soooo maybe not the most ideal team name guys
why does grian have a skeleton spawn egg
Pica Life
Grian: *trying to do everything he can to survive* Mumbo: *can't trust anyone* Skizz: *death-prone comedian*
11:32 Gaty in TPOT 9
I want these mod
4:49 Out of context quote. Wait there’s a thirst comment bot in the comment section I expected better from you. 5:46 I thought all events were gonna be active at the same time because they would stay active. A fun event would be that the dead members decide on an event to stay on permanently and a player to rejoin. 10:32 get two more stacks. 11:22 you could scaffolding clutch or go left and stop eating the dirt. 11:33 the bamboo is high. 14:22 If he conserves resources, he can make it to the water. 15:17 Please look down. You'll die otherwise maybe. 16:10 he places a block first and doesn’t take any fall damage. Then he eats the dirt and flies. He might have had slow falling but I didn’t see any particles. I'll get back to this tomorrow. 41:51 You should get more resources. 49:08 You said do something else.
Fun Fact: The German Word "Spanner" (pronounced Shpunner), translates to creep or stalker in English
😮
YIPEE NEW EPISODE
Shoulda called themselves The Bridgers then the base could be called Bridgerton.
God loves you
The bridge boys lol
“I just ate my seed”-Mumbo Jumbo 2024
34:04
I love the car. I think they should build a little car under your base just because why not
"Broken bridges, don't bridge" - Mumbo Jumbo, 2024  50:34
Wow ❤❤
Grian not realizing that red dye gave him 4 hunger bars is such a Grian thing to do.
42:44
36:40 what a tool honestly
1443rd
Episode 1- antman and paranoia Episode 2- munchies and bridges
BRO SPOILED THE WHOLE THING IN THE THUMNAIL 😢
Wildcard idea: Vampire mode- like a mob, you are damaged by sunlight, unless under cover.  Also I'm calling it now, that crack filled with stalactites is going to claim a life this season.
Huh, Im feeling peckish, don’t know about you..
42:45 that's going in a out of context clip for sure lol.
Mumbo saying "wait i can eat my pickaxe" while not facing the group, just felt so out there but also funnybfor some reason
7:13 That red dye just healed 3 and a half hunger
Grian ate red dye in the first 10 minutes of the video and it refilled 4 bars of hunger and he didn't say anything about that.
I'm enjoying the Series so far I'm excited for whatever wildcards are next
18:12 This is strangely feeling like a weird version of skynet 3.0 26:00 Not that iron hiding in the corner lol 35:20 Poor Bread Bridge being one-upped 42:45 JIMMY NO 🤣🤣🤣 43:20 They’re just hanging out, dw 44:36 Watchers said “Dw, we gotchu”  Episode 1: Sub-one club Episode 2: Above one club
21:52 how did you get the egg?...
The floating sud 1 spanner boys
Name suggestions could be the wild ones or something like that and it could have sub categories for each session
42:45 AYO
Wildcard Suggestion: Random Boogeyman Chain As soon as the Wildcard is active, someone is notified that they are the Boogeyman and have to kill someone by the end of the session. But, if they do kill someone, Boogeyman gets rerolled and someone else gets the curse, and this will continue happening until the session ends.
I love that everyone has a different group of allies for each season of this series. It’s so refreshing
Watching Grian mess with people as they try to figure out what the wild card is every session makes me laugh. Can't wait to see what other wild cards are to come!
30:04 cherry wotsits?!? disgusting combination
Ya know if the car is such an eyesore you could just put some tnt in there and then connect it to a button and then let nature take it's course. Just saying you don't have to be the one to push the button 😏
Been binging salad fingers I need some grian rn
What if a wildcard was fishing could give you other Minecraft items ? Like sugar cane ,stone,iron?or basically anything
24:32
33:37 Ok but there has to be a wrench-shaped bridge now right?
42:44 that was great I died for a bit and kept reminding XD
i would like to inform you that "Spanner" in german means a stalker...or someone who is creepy...just for you to know, if the name should actually stick around
if you crouch you explode
i think this is genuinely one of the funniest life series episodes yet, thank you and everyone else in the series for all the work you put into this series it is so fun to watch
4:41 Always the most clueless people to pick up on the most random occurrences (6:50 Oop-) 7:51 Such a polite death 😂 16:09Insane 21:15 Scolding him like a single parent 31:10 What a sentence 38:58 HELP 42:45 I hate how that got me too
Let’s goooo I’m loving Team MSG
21:59
I love it when dripstone fills me up
yeee
Jimmy: Eat my balls an- wait.... Grian: BAHAHAHAHAHHAHAH Mumbo: ....gladly 😏😏
I love this series!!!
* Wild Card Idea: Reverse Armour  * Thorns damages you when you hit mobs, fire resistance sets you on fire, unbreaking destroys armour super quickly, curse of binding prevents armour from being put on, etc
YOO WE BACK⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️
If Skizz dies before Jim, there will be a disturbance in the force.
Jimmy dies episode 6!  I'm calling it!
mark my word this will become a dripstone death 32:06
43:21 say that again?
Wild card idea: swap lava and water. Water hurts and you can swim in lava. Have is swap back and forth throughout the episode like food did.
Reverse water breathing
I don't even watch minecraft anymore but always gotta tune into the life series
35:22 Looks at Limited life Yeah 😀
I'm starting to see why you give each player six lives instead of the usual three.
A great wildcard would be hearing monster sounds whenever you are ose to dying/under 7hp
You guys bridged the lack of bridges in the Life series.
Please look at this comment grain I really think the team should be called the MSG haha ( mumbo skiz and grain )
Admit it grian mumbo you and skiz is msg for mumbo skizz grian
Mumbo is probably so scared that he'll die right after he is done building a base again xD
Mining does NOT ruin a video
This episode reminds me the Scrolls of Icarian Flight.
First the Sub Ones, now the Spanners, The trend of "S" names should continue, with it being on theme for each wildcard
16:10
Why do they keep making things out of wood?
Just sayin, as an American, I have never heard anyone call someone else a spanner.
Wildcard idea: Is the sun gone? - It's permanently midnight after the wildcard is active.
Wildcard idea: sideways gravity
this will either be the shortest or longest season of the life series and i'm both so terrified and so excited
I bet etho will win this season
i know a bridge the bread bridge it was sooo big that you can basically eat it.
Should make a reaction video with hermitcraft reacting to wildlife
I really wish their name continually changes.  So far you can call them: Sub 1 Club Floaters Spanners  Whats next?
2:26 suttle foreshadowing at the end the base looks like a face with hand.
At this rate Skizz won’t last beyond episode 4
i hope later wildcards result in some purposeful deaths rather than people just accidentally dying. it's only the second episode of the series thus far, so there's not a lot to go off of yet, though it feels like the series would benefit from something in addition to the wildcard system, like a boogeyman or something
grian please, for future reference can you not spoil when you die in your thumbnail? I would love to be surprised when you actually eventually loose
Wildcard idea: Everybody gets the number of lives of somebody else. For example, Grian gets the lives of Etho, Etho gets the lives of Gem...  When they lose a life, they lose the other person's life. So in the next session, the other person will have one life less.  However, if you lose your last life in this session, you are out and the other person will be on one life in the next session OR get your lives in the next session.  But you don't know exactly whose lives you get, you only know how many lives they have.
Wilcard idea: tag! Your it!  Functions the same way as tag in secret life, only instead of failing your task, the finale "it" loses a life!
wait how did brian get a mob spawn egg 33:40
Worst thing with the Mumbo death at the end... He could have ate again and just floated to water. Pure panic mode for him
Do NOT put Grians laugh on 0.25x speed its the funniest thing ever
Jimmy: PG guys!! Also Jimmy: eatmyballs
The "Floaters" with a toilet bowl logo.
You guys should bring back the boggeyman back, that would bring back some tension to each episodes
just change the team name to something completely different every episode, even if/when there's only one member left, and when the last member loses their last life it goes back to the sub one club
At this rate, Skizz is gonna be the first one out
Best Birthday ever New wild life video
If I had a nickel for everytime grian made bridges as a base I'd have 3 nickels which isnt a lot but its weird that its happened 3 times
The Spanners sounds like Tool's British counterpart
make a milk. bucket
like and sub or your get hunger iii
42:44 "eat my balls" - solidarity gaming 2024
42:44 "eat my balls" 💀
Now that they have buckets, next wildcard water is lava and lava is water. That will be fun
I love how Mumbo has got better at building but Grian still has not got better at redstone. 😂😂😂
They really need to be big friends with scar cos all scar had to do is lava bucket and their done 😮😅😂
Spanners is good but ppl are definitely going to call you bridge boys
Wildcard Idea: make hostile mobs passive and make passive mobs hostile
44:44 the creeper was a paid actor
Did I just see Grian have a spawn egg?
"Eat my ballz" -Jimmy 2024
43:22
42:45 I SPAT OUT MY GUM LMAOOO
42:46 WHAT.
Wild card idea! Taking wild to the next level every time you kill a mob you transform into that mob
I’m really loving these team ups ❤
The whole sequence of Grian telling Mumbo to calm down while throwing random items at him had me in tears
Ok hear me out... Make a tower so you can connect bridges to it. I was thinking like into a triangle with the already made ones
you know maybe you should be called the bridgers? could be good
THE BRIDGE BROS
"This is the base with the most bridge in all of the life serries" *Sad Bread Bridge noises*
now that they have a bridge base, i kinda think they should call themselves the phoebe bridgerers
jimmy super sus lol
42:45 is going out of conetext real quick
deffinetly not magic mountain
Bridge idiots  gang 😂😂
Please make it so that the wild cards stack, it would be so much more chaotic and fun
I was hoping the wildcards would stack, so every episode it would be more and more chaotic.
Its a good day when grian posts!!!!!!!
I think you guys should be called the Chameleons because they change their names every session depending on the wild card
I am here
they really manifested tango’s death😭
So much death in this episode! Goodness gracious dude!  Wild Card idea: every bit of damage causes a random effect (Potion effect, attribute change, mob spawn, etc)
Given how things are going, Jimmy might have competition on who goes out first if skizz keeps dying
35:20  for a band name: THREE BRIDGES  your base is made of 3 Bridges, and you have 3 Members
3:35 took me way to long to figure out he said rate
Wildcard idea for Halloween: "curse of the monster" (Werewolf) temporarily becomes a red name during nights.
5:40 did anyone else hear Ethan instead of Etho  I understand if that was just me
Yipe
I was really hoping to see some of you playing chicken with eating valuable items
Love a life series where Grian and Mumbo are in a group. :D  Loving the Spanners Trio.
I hope the gravity is gonna change in later episodes
Bros literally made Devils Bridge (Welsh tourist attraction)
5:13 Mumbo knows the meme!!
Now hear me out on this one..."The Mile High Club"
Did grian just give us a fake ad at the end…?
33:40 Grian when Bridges: 🤤
Wildcard  There is chance that hermit logs instead of you
The sub 1 spanners! They all share 1 brain cell
cobblestone. delicious
For the Bonus Clip, I mean it was clear you were off to the side and doing something else. I genuinely feel that Mumbo’s death was a result of the game.
pica simulator
would be nice if the thumbnails didnt make the wild cards obvious, its not as fun if we can already guess what the twist is gonna be
29:30 No grian you have not ruined my viewing experience you have put my mind at peace and given me everything from this wonderful video I could have asked for thank you grian
wildcard suggestion: Half of the server become boogeymen. They each have to kill one person to avoid becoming red, so absolute chaos ensues and either half of the players turn red overnight, or people have a good bit of lives chipped away.
The Sub-Spanners should be your team name
I like them proving the idea of British people making an insult of anything using "absolute" before it. 37:08
BRIDGE BOYS PART TWO!!!
20:16 why does grian have a spawn egg?
52:39 I mean, it would be about fair to transfer him one of your lives for that...
🔥🔥🔥
I don't suppose it's possible to get these as a standalone datapack kinda thing? I'd love to try and do just a normal minecraft playthrough with food like this changing every couple in game days or whatnot.
I absolutely love the Mumbo, Skizz and Grian trio  It’s so chaotic a perfect
“Eat my balls” SolidarityGaming 2024
A spanner is a wrench
The Bridge Boys
idea turn the meeting point into something a bit like skynet
mumbo got big mad for a bit there didn’t he 😂
39:05 is why grain shouldn’t be op ever
Wildcard ideas:  > All mobs are replaced with a creaking. > All mobs spawn at verified sizes. (Some small, some normal, some large) > Everyone gets a random effect for the duration of the session. (Effects include: speed, slowness, mining fatigue, jump boost, nausea, invisibility, blindness, weakness, glowing, levitation, slow falling, and darkness.) (I haven’t put poison or any ‘great’ effects as it’ll be too mean or not be as fun.) > infestation (Every time someone breaks a stone block a silverfish has a chance to spawn.) > Perpetual night time for the sessions duration. (Maybe increase enderman spawn rate for this.) > body swap (names and skins are swapped at random so no one knows who they are talking to or looking at.) > Hydra (kill one mob and two takes its place) > Invader (pillagers have entered the lands to ravage what they can, rivers and water ways have been flooded with guardians ready to pounce.) > Arachnophobia (the forests, planes, and caves are infested with spider nests (normal and cave spiders mixed together) > Secret Tasks make a return. > Have a “you are not the boogie man” pop up for everyone (and watch the paranoia.) > Infection (have skulk start spreading across the land in a few areas. If not stopped then Wardens may spawn.)
Grian, this wildcard was the opposite of fun. Utterly decimated people's life counts (and not even close to symmetrically), made progress a punishment, and forced everyone to be risk-averse and angry. Were i participant, I'd have quit on the spot when i saw it was randomizing a second time.
14:14
i have a good name idea for the team: team(the word team is optional) grizzbo or grizbo (gr for grian izz/iz for skizz and bo for mumbo)
Imagine 1 of two wild cards (also alternate mix together)  1: items look diferent than what they actually are 2: mix match skins e.g. mumbo gets lizzies skin(and name) 3: both items and players are mix matched
If only they recognised that spanner is slang for idiot here up north haha  Edit: they recognised it
Loved it!
9:16 Mumbo oozing made me chuckle
Does anyone else just love Grian's laugh? 😂
i just ate my seeds XD
Um, I know you owned up to it but could have saved Mumbo twice from starvation.
33:30 “I’m in soo hard already” the out of context video boutta go crazy
oh sugar plum fairy!!! :3
So uh, how does grain have a skeleton spawn egg? He’s had it for the whole video 33:39
Grain throughout the video having skeleton spawn egg
How is the meeting room not the shape of a spanner head? A move only a bunch of spanners could make.
Missed opportunity to say "We all float down here"
Nautilus Shells are common when you do some fishing - domt sleep on fishing in minecraft
8:04 LMAO, oversight😂
Mumbo always uploads before grian so now I have to watch both of them
"most bridge in a 3rd life series" what about the bread bridge
A wildcard idea is that gravity is randomized every 5 or 10 minutes, and either it's server-wide or different for everyone, which would be utter chaos!
yesterday I was at a convention and Jason Momoa was there but i was more excited about the four (4) different people wearing Grian cosplay
They build tons of bridges. You could say they're the Bridgertons
42:45 had me crying of laughter
Wildcard idea: Frostbite Everyone starts freezing at a rapid rate. You must wear leather armor and stay close to warm blocks (eg. furnaces or campfires) to survive
Someone clip it! Grian says "Scaffolding it good". Don't let this one go!
"most bridge, to bass ratio"- I'm sorry have we forgot about bread Bridge, limited life was the bridge season
For one of then you need to bring all of the wild cards back
Alright, let's get the predicitons up. What is next sessions wildcrad gonna be?  I'll guess that players are randomly gonna swap postions at certain intervals.
39:10 grian was ready to defend skizz at all cost 😂
50:09 GRIAN
You should do a floor is lava one where giant lava pools just appear everywhere
123
NGL I kinda wish the effects from previous sessions stuck around. That'd be some real chaos.
42:45 💀💀💀
An idea for one of the wildcards I have is every time a player says any good item they get a random length of time between five seconds and one minute of levitation.
If you make the floors of the bridges out of trap doors you could open them up and drop people with redstone...
The new name should be the high guys
Honestly spanner is a really good name for them as they often do a lot of stupid stuff
Wildcard Idea:  Everytime you take damage your hot bar gets scrambled. 😂
i want to see a wildcard where everyone swaps either places or inventories at random intervals
grian please clean ur inventory
YIPPEEEEE
Grian eating red or yellow dye or whatever it was and getting 3 full hunger and then not realizing is horrible
I can already tell that the rest of this series is going to be hilarious. I can’t wait to see the animatics people make of grian, skizz, and mumbo shoveling dirt into their mouths while floating away
i actually really adore how the wild cards have started pivoting the direction of the episodes, i really like seeing how it keeps the life series fresh and brings something new to the series!! i think this is something secret life accomplished well too, it keeps the life series from being all the same. i look forward to waking up every week and thinking “i wonder what the wild card will be today?” because they’re always so interesting each time!!! thank you for all the hard work you put into the life series gimmicks ❤❤❤
33:17 LMFO- GRIAN’S “oh he’s got he there.. OH HES GOT ME. IM IN!”
sub one sky scoundrels, duh
Grian poultry man has made an aperance in the MCC's
Them eating suger looks... suspicious if you know what I mean
“By the way if you eat my balls,…” -jimmy
If I got a nickel for every time Grian got into a group of 3 and started making bridges in a life series id have 2 nickels which isn't a lot but its weird it happened twice.
I've had to search what 'spanner, ponker, and scallywag' means.
15:17 the sub-ones have risen to new heights
Any merch?
35:25 I bread bridge would be very upset if it heard what you just said
Base name idea” float-topia”
5:18 care to explain what a ‘cheese dream’ is?
43:22 SAY THAT AGAIN
42:43 is the best moment 😂😂😂
Bread bridge 2, for the bad bride boys Alternatively  The sourdough Skyway for the spanners
gold ingots/blocks should give regeneration. Due to it being a crafting recipe for golden apples.
A name that is realated to every wildcard would be cool
this video should be called Caseoh simulator
While hilarious for the first video, by video 5 I am so over the sound of constant eating because of the massive amount of hunger.
I am kind of disappointed that it did not force everyone to permanently be the size they were at the end of the last session.
you should be call your selves the devil's because you have 3 bridges on top of one another like devils bridge
If I had a nickel for everytime Grian lived on a bridge in the Life Series, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot but it's weird it's happened twice.
Idea for bridge base, have the bridges go into the wall of the dent in the mountain, have it coil up in side the wall, more bridge, but have rooms for everything on the sides of the staircase in the walls
42:47 jimmy: if u eat my balls Grian: bursts into laughter
It's the bridge boys!
No merch yet?
Mumbo said that when Grian went to mine it's 1 minute of ruining the viewer experience... But, ironically,  as I watched mumbo's video first,  it's the only part I wanted to watch, as they are together all episode
Tango should absolutely have a life deducted for that bull that he pulled
sub one floaters
41:16 best interaction ever lol
Oh the sugar plum fairy
42:46 O:
Jimmy - “If you eat my balls” Mumbo -**Gladly**
I bet the last episode is gonna be all the wildcards combined
26:00
45:27  please say that didnt fly over your head
Please Grian, Mumbo, and Skizz. Do not, i repeat DO NOT call your group the spanners! It sounds too similiar to the german word "Spanner" in my opinion. Use Google Translate and Set it to German -> English, with "Spanner" being the word to be translated.   Ofc this comment is just meant  for a laugh, dont take it too serious.  P.S.: Love the content, keep it coming. <3
54:12 the worst part is that mumbo literally PAID grain a diamond to get information and then he was left to die when grian wouldn't tell him what food he could eat
this is the pica episode
33:23 "I'm in so hard" to the out of context videos that goes.
13:35 skeleton spawn egg 🤨🤨🧐🧐
4:30 Anyone know where the spawn egg came from?
30:25 how dos he have a spawn egg?
They are literally geting high on dirt
I love the life series so much, I'm so glad that you made a new addition to the live series! Can't wait to see more episodes and find how this unfolds.
I actually love that the greens are all acting so peaceful and creative. Reminds me of 3rd life before everyone got accustomed to the blood sports.
This episode is 10% progress and 90%  the lifers just panicking and eating 😂
If y'all are gonna change your name for every wildcard, just make it simple and call yourselves the Wildcards /hj
I just ate my seeds
you guys should be the bridge boys
My god I love this series 💚🧡❤️
To quote Etho, "You're a furry, aren't you?"
Put the names together   The sub one floaters spanners  Each new name just add it to the end so the name gets longer and longer
im waiting for the wildcard that tells everyone they are the boogeyman
42:45 oh yes my favorite pg series!!
Random crafting recipes would be a good wild card😂
Wild Card idea: Killing a mob will spawn two more on random coordinates at the surface, and undead don't burn under the sun or the time is always night.
Grian when is the next hermit craft episode coming out? its been almost 2 months!
Love you grian. even though you are one of the last to upload this series each session
Wild card idea what if everyone gets chained to the closest person and if they walk away or are two far away will get pulled back
"On fire floating or anything you can..." Me: "ON FIRE?? why would you be on fire so early in the season?"
Floaters Assemble!
34:06 “Dude, perfect.”
Bridge boys!
This is a disaster. Kinda agree with Grian about emerging, the car is nice tho
they shouldve named there team the Top Two uhh's
Let's go.... another grian episode 🎉
16:19 he was 1/8 of a block from hitting ground. If he was a second slower that could have killed. If he didn’t place blocks, he would have been 2 blocks and 1/8. Would have been safer to not place blocks
If I had a nickel for every time Grian and two other people made their base a bridge in a life series, I’d have two nickels, which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it happened twice
I litterly just watched the first one
On everybody’s soul, The sub-one club will return🙏
33:28 nooo grian why! 42:45 nooo Timmy why!
Sooo many people died in the first 10 minutes and nobody cared about half of them
Wild card idea: Make tools and weapons change usages (ex. A sword tills the dirt, a pickaxe can start fires like a flint and steel, shears can mine stone).
I love when grian makes buckets  just to leave them empty the entire episode
Yoooooo!!!!!
Also, I really enjoy the slower start to the life series!  So friendships form, people can gather stuff and equipment, which makes the final episodes even more dramatic!
By the way, your bridge is flammable
This is so much more chaotic than the first episode, it’s funny.
50:34 "cause broken bridges...dont bridge" You what...statement
27:47 sugarplum fairy??
Y'all. You gotta be the Spanner Inquisition.
Wildcard Idea: Lava and water swap.
Dripstone base might end up with more kills then the skynet ladder.
42:52 The Andrew Garfield Laugh
Surely as the spanners you can take that car apart 👀
42:46 wild life out of context
Don’t eat my balls  Grian hahahahahaha
Funny thing about the Spanner as an insult talk: Spanner means Stalker in German, and that also kind of fits. Both are trying to figure out where Grian wet when ever he leaves for 5mins xD
I am loving the wild cards, they've been such a fun unique way to spice up the game and add intrigue especially at the beginning of the episode and create really fun play styles through the episode
13:33 why does he have a skelly spawn egg... 😂😂
feel like this is going to be the shortest life season yet
The Sub 1 Floaters should change their name every episode
You guys should make little gatehouses at the ends of each bridge for storage or as defense or something.
They shall get revenge on Tango
42:43  😂😂😂
Didn't.....  Didn't Mumbo's Season 8 base have 3 bridges?
The spanners in German translates to stalkers
iconic line: "WAIT I CAN EAT MY PICKAXE."
Add back the boogeyman for 1 session, but keep the random stuff to happen
Great previously on
Cant wait for every wildcard to activate at once in the finale
3 allies Many lives Grians allies losing many lives Acts of stupidity Hating the name before fully dedicating to it Grian having many diamonds Bridges A minecart track near grians base  I think we’ve finally found bad boys 2
Why does Brian have a spawn egg?
Wildcard idea: Double life return. Everyone gets a shared healthbar with a partner. This would make for some interesting splits of allies and enemies :)
Skeleton spaw egg😮
Aww no longer -1 block size
wait, why does grian have a skeleton spawn egg?
31:18 This gave me so much anxiety
42:44 MY HEAD SNAPPED UP SO FAST, I ALSO DONT THINK IVE BURST OUT LAUGHING SO QUICK 😭😭 JIMMY!!
Whats that spawn egg doing in your inventory grian?😂  Edit: 42:48
42:50 Grian's adorable little laugh killed me 😆
''I can think of a bigger bridge''  Am I the only one who remembers the bread!
the floaty men return
33:30 😏
13:20 "It's like being in Minecraft BETA"  Nice Evo reference!  Or it might just be that you were one of the early players, in which case I am looking to closely.
I miss hc
10:01 How did Grian get what looks to be a skeleton spawn egg? or is it a ghast spawn egg?
i think the appel's rotten right to the core?????? (btw are you having a braat summer)
Wake up Grian posted a new vid on the new series!
I am shocked jimmy didn’t die
43:25 talk tuah??
16:39 this is all
mumbo please dont die i love yo
42:47 Thats one iconic laugh XD
Nobody's talking about the enderman thing??? Nobody???
30:02 "Cherry Wotsits"
So being called a spanner is like being called a tool.
Don't Starve Together be like:
That car is gonna get blown up.....
Why grain have mob egg?
42:45 oh my god
Name idea “The name changers”
Who still remembers the bad boys?
Please clean up ur inventory
i had two hours to kill before the mexican f1 GP qualifying. And Right at that moment, i see my fav minecraft youtuber uploading an hour long video, and Magic the noah uploading not long before you. :)  i have some cookies and it's gonna be a banger evening. Thank you Grian !
for the final episode all wildcards should cards should be on, the chaos :)
Mombo in complete deniel: This is beautiful, this is the best base we've ever built.
jimmy goes "if you eat my balls" at 42:41 and mumbo goes??? gladly?????
Sub 1 floaters.
WILD CARD IDEA: when you break craftable items they break into the materials it was crafted with like a furnace turns into 8 cobble stone meaning some blocks like dirt are unaffected, this could also lead to some CHEAKY duplications like planks turn into a log, this could also make others really stressed not to misplace certain things just to go through the hassle of having to craft it again. “Cool idea man””thanks Grian”*Grian gives approving thumbs up👍*
Grian thanks for bringing back this smp back, I’m loving this so much. 👍👍
Don't starve together expierience
42:46 came over from Mumbo's episode just for the bits he cut out. Am not dissapointed.
This wild card did not help the paranoia problem 😂
In session 1, they could change their size by holding shift or jump. In this session, they were given hunger 3 but could eat ANYTHING. Non food items eaten have different effects. This time, there were 3 deaths. Mumbo, Ren and Skizz all died from starvation.
Grian, I beg you to please put su-spanders on all your skins
So many great laughs in this one lol, I love the life series. 🤣🤣
39:43 how did he get a spawn egg??
Ok really what spanner means in england ? 😂
35:31 What about the Bread bridge 😞
This wild card was excellent, really fun to see. Wondering if we’ll see a peek back to the Disasters game with a wild card as the random teleport swap. Maybe they’ll teleport, maybe they won’t. Could be chaos
Grians secret life bridge base
23:58 "because... Skizz is floating"
39:35 uhhh skizz should be on 3 lives *pulls out diamond axe* 😂
Grians inventory management problem for the whole episode is killing me😂
33:25 was wild bro 💀
Team catchphrase suggestion: Time to throw a Spanner in the works.
The bonus clip was so good
I imagine with every new episode and new wild card, the sub ones/floaters/spanners will make a new name for themself.
Grian gives me such mum vibes how he gave Skizz and Mumbo the buckets.
Wild Card Idea- a few people temporarily loose/gain lives.   Or   Your inventory gets switched with another person.
I wonder what the twist is
The out of context compilation guys are gonna have a field day at 42:45
“grian you’ve given me a bowl, a bowl grian” best mumbo line of this series
I hope the last session of wild life its just every wildcard that's been shown just activates on it so its just pure chaos
Hey by the way if you eat my balls 42:45 😂😂😂😂
42:45 out of context now
HAHAHAHA IVE FINALLY CAUGHT UP ON ALL OF IT!!! WE’RE LIVE NOW BABY
15:16 The way skizz screams 😭
6:38 babies when they build sandcastles
I love how mumbo still has the waffle
"Life series base with a better Bridge to base ratio"  THE BREAD BRIDGE WOULD LIKE A WORD WITH YOU
42:45 THE FACT THAT YOU KEPT THIS IN IS SO FUNNY.
42:45 Jimmy: BTW EAT MY BALLS!! Grian:**BURSTS OUT LAUGHING **😂💀💀
I love the sub-ones/floaters/spammers
What if every block mined adds a “miner” amount of speed.
Finale Idea: Once the game is down to two finalists (or maybe once everyone's on red) *every wildcard* from the previous episodes are activated at once
Mumbo has the best references
28:01 guys I think grian is English
Sub 1 club was the BEST name !!!
Yes this is very “ suger plum fairy “ Weird stuff I heard:  Tim: btw if you eat my balls- (insert Grian laughing loudly)
Wild Card Idea: Shrink the border slowly throughout the first half of the episode until the only thing left is spawn, and the only way to get back any of the map is to kill green names (this would be a later in the series Card)
34:50 Grian: Scar, what are you doing?? Scar: I'm making a roller coaster! :DD Grian, in a tired mom voice: of course he is.
6:48 Mumbo's panic screaming killed me 😂
You're Videos. are the Yes❤
Just leaving these here 33:30 42:45
32:25 and then not to copy other seasons, you plat carrots
"btw if you eat my balls" into "ive got loads of wood" within probably less than 30 recording seconds is insane
Grians inventory problem is really really starting to get on my nerves.
Wildcard idea (for probably later in the series): If a player dies, they come back for five minutes in order to kill someone else. If they run out of time, they lose that life but if they successfully kill someone, they get their life back. Deaths would lead to full scale wars.
Love how the car ruined grains immersion but not the panda enclosure or weird task, or scar’s roller coaster 🤣
The out of context for this session is almost worse than last session😂
Love the vids <3, but is hermitcraft continuing during the life sires?
skiz has quickly bumped up to one of my favorite personalities on hermit craft.
Next epsisode SKIZZ IS RED
Problem is, they've made such a good joke opportunity of burning all their bridges, that someone is 1000% gonna burn them down
47:12 WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY ARE PLAYING MC WITH QUAGMIRE
WILDCARD IDEAS: - Everyone turns into mobs with special mob powers, and it switches every so often.  - Every time you break a block it has a chance to generate a structure - Lucky blocks start to randomly spawn in waves - Drown in air and breathe in water - You can make tools out of anything - The trees become hostile when you try to break them
did anyone notice thst grian said the dripstone is filling him right up 26:27
34:14 is no one gonna talk about the person falling in the background it looks like a shooting star
"We can actually get something done this session and not worry about food all the time," you say as you know the food will reset in like 20 minutes. This card was really creative and funny great work.
Fun fact: "Spanner" is german for "creep". Specifically peeking  tom.
28:36 that's funny Because the armour gave resistance
Hilarious video, looking forward to next week! Saw you were sick during phasmo yesterday, hopefully you're feeling a bit better :D
the start made me think of eystreems season thing about the darkness and corruption series thing.
2 hour or less gang 👇
42:45 😂😂😂😂😂😂 don't even need to take out the context😂
"I just ate my seed" - mumbo😭😭
42:45 my god jimmy
PG!!!!
I was about to say if you start planting wheat on these bridges I'm going to hire pearl and scar to set it on fire lol
my cat just died😞
Watched half of this on my lunch, I’ll finish the rest once Im off work
They need to build factions bases lol
Wild life is so fun, I love this series :)
I have a feeling this is gonna be one of the shortest life series ever, they're dropping like flies
wake up new canary just dropped
For a wildcard you should change everyone’s skin and name (if u can). For example, making scar look like Mumbo and Mumbo looking like scar.
At the end it should be all past wild cards are active
Episode 2 Fat life
The explanation for mumbo's previous behaviour is simple.... (Very) Small angry man syndrome
ah finally, the bridge-idiot dropped 🥰
(idea) hot potato? every 15 minutes 3 random poisoned items will be chosen, if a player has them in their inventory, they will get withering 1, chests in which these items are contained will drop all items on the ground if the items are not removed within 15 minutes
I’m betting that all of the wild cards will be active on the final day
Great Video Grian! Keep up the good work!
I would be really interested in a Life series with a new mod taking effect every session. Like they stay after the session so there are more mods as the series goes on.
why are you eating a 74 foot deep well in Wisconsin
I've been loving this series. I love how chaotic everyone's bases are lol
15:17 this foreshadowed the entirety of Skizz’s session
42:45 needs to be horn of the week
The massive car's ruining the immersion, but three bridges and a precarious meeting platform isn't? XD
Teal fans ate you here
Anti Pewdiepie base
Omg grian wanting to ban tango just made me die of the funny
22:17
the spanners would also work for short attention spans!! (which would also work with the original thing that started the group, being short)
42:45 MADE ME LITERALLY CHOKE ON MY DRINK. I WAS THERE COUGHING AND WHEEZING FOR 5 MINUTES
With the solidification of The Spanners I'm gonna miss Mumbo coming up with wild new names every session to match the effect
This card killed so many people instantly
Green with mush man at begging all we needed
29:36 is such a glorious shot
hmmm... Mumbo doesn't have the grey streak in the Life Series?  So it's a Hermitcraft storyline?
0:26 Why does he have a spawn egg?
Loving this series. One of the wild cards needs to be random crafting recipes or random drops.
how did grian get a skeleton spawn egg? 13:24
Grian chooses the half hunger bar pink dye instead of the deepslate bricks with jumpboost that is crazy
The hunger games 2
I've been SUPER excited for this all day! I've been checking  my phone a lot,   telling my dad all about the series. I even found out what time it was in England to guess when you would post. I was soo happy when the video came to my for you page. Thank you, Grian, for making the life series. It is the best thing ever. The annamations that come from them are epic as well. THANKS❤❤❤❤
33:26 PAUSE!!!!
Why not be the be the bridge bois
what if damage was randomized? imagine oxidized copper dealing 19 hearts of damage but a diamond sword dealing 2
Started feeling sick not too long ago, this cheered me up, thx grian :3
Mumbo has gone from intense paranoia about grian abandoning them to intense anxiety about what happens when eating at every second of the session
52:45 Oh my goodness Grian I though you were trying not to cry instead of trying not to laugh and panicked so hard for a second there. My heart *dropped* out of my chest 😂
They are just playing flappy bird
Hiiiii under an hour club🎉🎉🎉👇👇👇👇
Mumbo Secret life: Axis is a great name! Mumbo Wild Life: What about the Floaters?  Dying rn XD
Around 35:00 - 36:00 when they are saying there has never been a bigger bridge to base ratio... Bread bridge? That base was only bridge, and bread lol
This is like Saturday Morning Cartoons for the fanbase XD
42:45 no context
They should be the Paranoia Patrol
Thank you for the bonus clip :]
Bridge = LIFE
started from the bottom still there
no please "spanner" in german is stalker that name is awful i can't XD
63k views in 1 hour is crazy
Going on a full three weeks of sickness, thank you to Grian for making it bearable
22:00  Grian: Wanna smoke? Skizz: Literally gets high in sky 😂
The out of context compilations are going to be SO GOOD this season, I can feel that 😂
39:09 "B, A, N"
21:29 editing grian cracks me up all the time. i think it would be really funny if he commented on more things like this- something like cleo!
Set speed to x0.25 and click here 16:10.   Thank me later
« I eat my seeds » Mumbo Jumbo, 26/10/2024
I love the feel of this series, reminds me of the blooper clips we see from streams!
I think the randomness have made awesome fun. I somehow wish that that people kept the sizes they were at last session, and the food stayed random.  You could make an entire life season called "big life"? where everyone begins as 4 blocks tall, then when they die they become 3 blocks tall, then 2 blocks, and then 1. The last life they are only 0.5 blocks tall.  That alone give a lot of changes to how you play the game. But I also think you could give big people some extra reach, some haste and strength and a small speed boost. But make it so they need much more food. While the small guys need much less food
Why doesnt Mumbo want to change your team name from sub 1 club to sub 1 intelligence club?
YESSS GRAIN POSTED AGAIN!!!!
I’ve been watching old ones of these till this came out I’m so happy it has ❤❤❤❤
Could you add the boogyman? That was my favorite and it would definitly fit the haloween season
cant wait till THIS ONE gets added to the pile of lore
This team lost basically 1/3 of all their lives on episode 2
If I had a nickel for every time Grian teamed with goofy people who die way too often and will inevitably leave him stranded to fight for himself at the end of the series I would have two nickels, which isn’t a lot but it’s weird that it happened twice
OvO
42:45
Build more bridges and make your base donkey kong
the Sub-Spanner Floaters
grian... why do you have a skeleton egg?
42:47
Scar saying “shut up” is so funny to me i don’t know why.
The most adorable floaters I have ever seen 😂❤
I just googled what "spanner" means...oh happy day
Why does Grian have a spawn egg lol
The out of context this season is going to be *U N H I N G H E D*
Thank you for leaving in 42:44
Wildcard idea: every 20 minutes names and skins change for everyone
Idea for next episode: Item drops will either double, or disappear
Something I could have missed but still want to know do the wild cards stack?
i don't think i've ever heard mumbo so mad when the food first randomized
It was right there "because broken bridges dont spemm"
42:45 LOL 😂
Wildcard idea: elitra cycling. 1st Jump. No elitra. 2nd jump. Elitra actvate 3rd jump. No elitra . Etc  Whould have to keep track of your number of jumps and elitra often lead to crashes.
Honestly this series has been great, i love getting to see this trio interact and just chill around the BAM group, its really lovely getting see the friends interact with each other
Honestly i think it would be funny if they destroy the car next episode
The bridge trolls
I KNOW ANOTHER NAME FOR THIS TEAM! Skizz and Waffles
47:09 skizz sounds like Quagmire lol
If you’re reading this comment, which YouTubers’ pov(s) are you watching?    I’ll go first:  Grian Mumbo Jumbo GeminiTay Smallishbeans LDshadowlady
love ur vids !!! :D
There is just something innately funny about eating dirt to fly.
why does grian have a spawn egg?
Who thinks Mumbo is going to kick Grian off the team with everything that's happened XD
"Jimmy eat this " is just hilarious 😂 😂😂😂😂
14:30 Sub-1 Activities of stealing Fizzy Lifting Drinks from Wonka.
I can already see Grian floating out of the Sub1 group with Mumbo's and Skizz death rates
How about instead of being called something new each episode, what if you guys ADDED to the name. For example, "The Sub-One Floaters", or "The Sub-One Spanners".
What about bread bridge
Why do these guys love bridges so much 💀  They had the bread bridge last season
42:44 THIS THIS ONE IS OUT OF CONTEXT
At 34:17 you can just see someone falling from the sky in the background and it's hilarious
Did anyone else see the two people in the back ground falling down at 33:52?
43:20 DID HE SAY TALK TUAH 🔥🔥🗣️
idea for a potential future wildcard: food, golden apples, and potions do NOT regenerate health, but a random source of damage heals the player instead. this source of damage is randomized throughout the session
We're getting good content tonight!
Name idea: the bridge boys
I am IN LOVE with the longer videos. It’s so much fun to watch one while building in my own Minecraft world
Thanks for 150 subscribers
Next series idea: No Life - Literally nothing happens. There is No series. That’s it.
41:39 BRING BACK THE BOOGEY MAN FOR A WILD CARD BUT HAVE LIKE 4 OF THEM (that would be hilarious AND YOU COULD KILL TANGO  FOR THE SECOND TIME >:D)
I mean the name should really change every session, it's tradition now
42:44 JIMMY????? JIMMY W H A T??????????
Brige boys
"Broken bridges don't bridge." - Mumbo 2024
Under an hour! 👇
Wild card idea: You can Run but you can't Hide. Everyone has the Glowing effect.
If you don't like screeching and yelling  avoid this series.
“Most bridge to base in third life”   How desperate Grian is to escape the egg.
theres so many good lines here "you wanna smoke?"
"Cause broken bridges... don't bridge..." -Mumbo  "....yeah, that's a saying..." -Grian
Good vid
yeah
Change the team name every episode
Very excited for the team name to change every session. 🤣
Is the game laggy or the video or my cell phone? God😢
This slaps :)
Hi
I'm gonna say it.. I don't like how most of the thumbnails/titles spoil the secret! Pearl's was nice because it just alluded to it, and fooled me into thinking there was a return of the Boogeymen.
so happy that the old life series returns where from ep 2 theres some secrecy and competition
16:15 lmao sub 1 intelligence I love all the new group names from this series :)
bread bridge mumbo?
Omg I totally see it 36:14
43:21 talk tuah
26:25 excuse me
I love how mumbo stresses everyone out when Panic hits, grian ended the episode with a lot less hair.
15:17 was the realest scream of terror
34:17 am I tripping or is someone falling out of the sky 42:45 if you eat my WHAT
| Petition to call them the Bridgertons
How did 50000 people watch this video in 52 minutes
39:08 this moment when all of them realized that Grian actually have too much power
Double life Wildcard: Everyone is bonded with a random person for one episode
43:54 i thoght he was tiny again for a second there
I dont mind seeing mining in your videos. The FULL INVENTORY THOUGH IS TRIGGERING ME BEYOND IMAGINATION PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
OH I KNOW THIS MOD! I love this new problem!
Under 2 hour
45:28 Dis-spanned
This life series is maybe the best thing I've seen with the new Minecraft data stuff. I really hope you release it as a data pack
33:29 that's going in the out of context for sure! so is 42:45
You are my childhood Ps I am 11 😂😂😂😂😂
take a shot every time grian says sugarplum fairy
The Bridge Crew or High flyers but it's been hilarious watching this episode..😂😂
42:46 HEJSKANIAJSIQNSAJJSBW HE KEPT THAT IN?!?!
Never in my life would I have expected this video to include the sub one club floating through the sky eating dirt and scaffolding.
A good wild card would be to swap textures of every block (mobs and players could also be fun)
"bridge idiots" -Gem
Alternative title; hungry games
42:46 might just be the best out of context clip from the life series 😂
The sugarplumb fairy... is this a Crown of Candy reference? :D
He paid you and you watched him die!! The betrayal!
the sugar plum fairy is my new favourite thing
As a German i think u should maybe change the name bcs translated  in german it means Stalker
“The bridge boys”
YA'LL WAKE UP GRIAN HAS POSTED AGAINNN !! (I always watch Grian's POV first. .)
The BRIGERS!
Fresh comments
I was wondering why you didn't upload at the same time as everyone else. Waited to watch yours first (tho got spoiled by scott's DAMN title!!!)
Idea for a wildcard: no 2 people will have the same effect
this wildcard made the session look like a notvixios video
They really went from eating all the food sources (cows) in third life , to eating everything they came across in Wild life
43:08 "that's what you tell everyone isn't it" LMAO???
"By the way, if you eat my balls" BEST JIMMY LINE EVER
42:45 hey btw if you eat my balls- AHHAHAAHEEEEEEEEEEEE
42:45 "hey by the way, if you eat my balls" followed by grian's OUTBURST of laughter never gets old   (for clarification, this is not the first time grian has laughed at suspicious jokes/sayings, and he always laughs the hardest out of everybody despite being a family friendly content creator. this is what “never gets old” means. sorry for confusion in the comments 🙏)
at 10:41 why do you has a spawn egg? >:D a silverfish spawn egg?
35:27 BAD BOYS BREAD BRIDGE MENTION??????  edit: 44:01 BREAD BRIDGE EXPLICIT NAMEDROP
yea its going to be ithere 10 or less episode
Welp that’s a lota deathm7:55
The “eat my balls” thing is killing me lmao
That escalated SO quickly
8:06 him just floating in the background 😂
42:45 WHAT 😭
26:26 Kinda sus grian, espically when there is pointed drip stone 🤨
Skizz not realizing what strange British insults mean is very chobblesome.
33:29 how did grain get a spawn egg lmao am I crazy?
15:15 oh boy how I love this voice chat mod LOL
Yay
wild card idea: this, but with a randomized item texture using the new command, and extra thing that changes the name of items to either be randomized, or the same as the texture
16:19 bro was literally 1 pixel off if you slow it down
hear me out: bridgerton brothers
Grian is our favorite sugar plum fairy boy
"oh sugar plum fair" -grian 2024
13:20 “it’s like being in Minecraft beta” EVO REFERENCE
29:08 Anyone else spot the Red Dwarf quote?
18:33 idk why but the way he said it just made me laugh
Love this season so far! Definitely smart to double the number of lives tho 😂😂😂
The heck is a suger plum fairy 💀  Edit: When is the next Hermitcraft episode?
I ate my seeds
22:00  "You wanna smoke" - Grian   *Never would I have thought G would say that but here we are*
44000 views in 40 minutes 😢grain fell off
i'm early :)
42:45 spit out my water
Are we allowed to suggest wildcards? It would be cool but it might take awhile to implement
The floaters  Three Floaters all above No shove all bro love Tiny base with strange food galore You must eat! EAT EAT MORE Bridges swinging noisy neighbors   Dicing with Death Red-eyed murder TOO FAR YOU FALLETH Skizzy with sub-one brain cell G the builder Mumbo the charmer  Don't look to the walls or a new wall may spawn Hands-on constant paranoid sneakiness all not by gone Hi-ho! The one sub Floaters stack of wood  Ever changing food, ever hunger, join us again to live intros dude!
Hate to be that guy but I think you had a very big advantage here. Most of the players were strategized to collect a viable food source in the first quarter of the video and they spent most of the time working for it.They did not know the food sources were going to be randomized after a while.
Wildcard idea everyone gets a random superpower for example like invincible to lava or something like that
„Spanner“ in German - so if you‘d write the word and pronounce it in german - is someone who basically stalks you/looks at people in locker rooms and changing booths and such. So, I was on bord with it before it was written out and I realized that it’s written like that XD
39:40 Why does Grian have a spawner egg?
3 meat sticks 21:46
What if every few episodes had a wildcard which had permanent effects.  Like if, for example, you stayed the height you were at the end of the first session
.
I think a additive effect instead of a random one may have been better
Apperently when Grian plays any Life games, he just turns into a bridge architect.
"You wanna smoke?" - Grian 2024
Did anyone else notice the spawn egg in grians inventory?
I imagine by the last session every wild card will be active
Did no one notice that spawn egg in grians inventory
loving the floaters you mumbo and skizz are a very funny trio and the twist of having to find out the wild card and adapt is so funny each session there is never a dull moment in life series you have really outdone yourself this time grian! cant wait for more of wild life its so fun
22:01 Grain: here, try a smoker  •seconds later• Skizz: •screams• Grain: •looks to where skizz was last, looks up to see him flying away•  Perfection lmao
Grian and Mumbo become Jumbo in this episode
Within 40 minutes
I would honestly rather watch Grian mine and get kitted out than almost die with mumbo and skizz. I also wished he had picked some better teammates' pvp wise.
This mountain has the most chaotic people living on it
A wild card where every past wild card activates.
YESYESYES MORE LIFE SERIES THANK YOU GRIAN
nice
tHe sUGaR plUM fAiRY
27:43 ohhhhh sugar plum fairy pleaseeee- Grian  42:45 by the way if you eat my balls- Jimmy
idea: get a new name relative to the wild card and add it to the name e.g this episode is the sub 1 floaters
29:30 Uh oh, Mumbo is being paranoid again…
The wingardium leviosAHHHs
Idk why, but when I saw the episode title I thought he meant eating out of a well
W vid
I hope one of the episode twists is something "constructive" as in a twist that lets them construct over-the-top structures on a never before seen scale - the map still feels quite normal at the moment so I'm hoping they get the chance to absolutely ruin the skyline at some point.
COOL
These guys have activated the Zane Little inside of them.
Nothing like a new life series to cheer you up when you're sick!
Grian "Could we actually get stuff done this episode without worrying about food" Also Grian spends a quarter off the episode trying different things to eat and floating lol🤣
They should keep expanding the name. So they started off as the sub-ones then turned into the sub-one-floaters, and they keep adding on until they disband.
Wild card idea: if you kill a mob, you become that mob
Ok
27:43 sugar plum fairy!
so the issue with seeing invisible people is actually to do with the team command that was used for the 4+ lives team.  teams have automatically set settings, one of which is that team members can see other team members if invisible, and that is what happened there. im not sure the exact command to fix it but i think its something like: /team modify [team name for 4+ lives] seeInvisibleTeammates false  if that doesnt work, the visual options that appear will hopefully guide you
Hehehe
It would be funny to combine every twist when coming up for a new team name, so this session’s team name could be like “flying dwarves” or something like that
Grians in MCC!!!
I love the idea of you mumbo and skiz changing your team name every session to match what the wildcard is >XD
IM YOUR BIGGEST FAN
Grian trying desperately to calm mumbo down
20:32 the way that skizz just disappeared😂😂😂
skizz has +1 aura
The Food tab was real food but ALSO miscellaneous
yes😊
Grain, you cant eat zrmor.
I can’t wait for Wild Life out of context. Especially for moments like 42:43
"i can eat my seed" -mumbo jumbo
YESSSSSS
Spoiler blocker✖️✖️✖️
acctually watc 42:43 and onwards in slowmotion
And so, the famine strikes
i am SO happy that you left "that" at 42:45 in, made me spit out my chicken nuggets i was eating at the time! xD
This is so far my fav series
Imagine a wild card where all crafts and drops are random
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
still waiting hermit eps 26
Bdubs intro has earned my sub to him
Sugar plum fairy??
Imagine the anamatics for this episode, just people eating random objects
I actually started to choke on my food when mumbo suggested that they change the group name to "the floaters" 😭
Grian is the Thomas of Wild Life (Mazerunner)
Who up rn watching this
My day just got way better!
No one has finished the video
Lets ggoooo
Editing Grian is just like us: He sees things and wants to make a point about them. The difference is he isn't among 5 k other comments
484th comment
Everyone’s evaporated this episode.
21:59 Wait what
Pls let doc into the series
I was thinking that their group name could be the tri-bridge tribe, has a nice ring to it.
When is the next hermitcraft
13:26 why does he have a skeleton spawn egg?
Grian always uploads the latest put of all the lifers,i had to watch Skizz and Mumbo's Pov to get what big G did.
Grian why don’t u have the armour thing on ?
Wild card suggestion: unlimited mining/ placing/attacking distance
I love this eating mod!
Fingers crossed jimmy wont be out first this series
NEW EPISODE WOO!! Thanks for the meal 🙏🪨
44:35 "blows up with mind"
20:43 That ‘Oh No…’ sounded so fake. Almost as if he knew it was going to be randomized 🤔  Edit: this was a joke, I know that Grian knew it would happen 😅
Wild Card idea (though I don't expect suggestions are a thing like they were in SL) - "All previous Wild Cards are active." And I know we don't get a literal description of the episode's wild card. Mainly I was imagining a way to see a return of the shrink & grow card late in the season.
Wildcard idea: Entire three hour session is a thunderstorm and any sword or ax in hand acts like a lightning rod.
you epic I 3can
Under 1 hour gang ↓
I get so excited to see how long these videos are that I just know my day will be filled with everyone's povs.
16:15 grian sounding like an angry mother is so funny lolll
ohhh i am so happy its almost an 1 hour episodee! i just cant get enough of this seriess!!!
all of us: what will be grian's gimmick today grian: i am gonna make everybody galactus
Yalls name for your group shouldve been the airheads.
why does grian have a panda spawn egg?
Love your videos so much 😊
Poor grian. Mumbo on 4 and skizz on 3. At this rate he won't have teammates by session 4!
Love this series. Every iteration of the Life series is great
When’s the puns bit guna happen
Wow I'm so early to this video!
I have sub one brain cells
WAKE UP WAKE UP NEW LIFE SERIES EPISODE
Do a wild life where you switch places with a random player every 15 minutes
You guys gotta change your name every episode to match the wildcard.
Hi
16:06 biggest clutch of the series
Grian ur videos slay good luck for the next episode
I am not watching 54 minutes 😭. Please make these shorter, I don’t have time to watch an hour worth of YouTube
:)
You guys should have a wildcard that has the same twist as another season like there being a boogey man or shared hearts😀😀😀
15:17 That screaming made me laugh so hard 😂
Watching Grians Pov and then the others is epic.
The intro was very welcoming. GET OUT!!!
18 mins
Does anyone know if the Life Series Merch store is going to open up again??
I love how many of these wild card effects utilize the new components and attributes in minecraft! It shows off the crazy things that mojang has been working on behind the scenes for map makers and datapack creators like myself!
I've been waiting for this!
42:45 “If you eat my balls” - Jimmy 2024
54 minutes of a life episode, you treat us too well
GRIAN AND MUMBO BEING FRIENDS AND HANGING TOGETHER YAYYYY
Wildcard suggestion: Players take upwards knockback instead of damage. The more hearts they would have lost by whatever hit them, the higher up they're launched.  This also applies to fall damage, so if not careful the player will bounce up and down all over the place like the whole world is a giant trampoline
XD
what was that about eating balls?
Get out shut up you big oaf
So good to have grian and mumbo on a group again. And skizz makes it funnier as well
New Episode!!! Nice!
😮
Hi
Where’s hermitcraft
Fun idea for the next life series could be “Silent Life” it would absolutely need mods, but I imagine something reminiscent of the movie A Quiet Place
idea: when yall greet each other say “sup sub ones”
I love the dynamic between Mumbo and Grian!
Wildcard Idea: Every 30 minutes to an hour, the wildcard changes to a random past wildcard. Mix in the double life pairing as one of the wildcards that can be pulled.
!!!
I LIKE TO SAY I HAD GRIANS PAGE OPEN SINCE THE MORNING JUST SO I COULD SEE THIS EP
I literally watched this pt1 like an hour ago. What luck pt2 came out rn
E
4:40 "I just ate my pickaxe" Everyone starts munching on thr first thing in their hand
Grian's perspective always seems to be the most or one of the most intresting
Grian is the best floater
Grian and Mumbo teaming up in the Life Series was something I was waiting for <3
Everytime I see i a new episode it brings me joy.
Grian after you make a base you should make secret underground tunnels for escaping later in the series when everybody starts killing each other
I was watching mumbo's and skizz's videos while i wait for your video to be uploaded, i got really confused what were you doing while you are away from the gang, im finally about to see it 😊
FINALLY
Thank you Grian for the upload!! I really needed the dopamine and your videos always cheer me up!
"i just ate my seeds" MUMBO WHAT
not me watching mumbo's vid right b4 this and wondering where grian's pov is
Mumbo being mean to Joel's shark was something else
9:44 🤨
4:47 "i just ate my seeds"  this season has already been so rich in clippable materialespecially Bdubs video title
WHEN HERMITCRAFT????????
I am the only one who keeps forgetting they can shift near edges now and is panicking everytime they get close?
Grian should do the last time on dragon ball z next video
WHEN HERMITCRAFT????????
3:16 Oh my gosh Grian😂😂😂 You speaking so fast
WHEN HERMITCRAFT????????
I was waiting for this whole week I'm so happy the words cannot describe it
grian eating skulk veins was not on my bucket list today
wild card idea-  double life / life link for one episode with someone random.(rip to one who gets scar)
"GET OUT! you.. big oaf!!"
WATCHING THIS IN 2X SPEED IS ACCTUALLY SO FUNNY
Why is your pov aut like 3 hours later then mumbo it’s torture to have to wait for your pov when other members povs is already out it’s like getting a huge cake in front of you and then not being able to eat it for multiple hours it’s just sitting there laughing at you on the table (by the way, this is meant as a compliment, and not as a hate comment towards when you uploaded I understand that people have different schedules)
life seiries idea: Stacked Life. 5 lives eatch, sleeping dissabled, phantoms dissabled, other than that standard minecraft but every episode, you get a small buff, nothing big like maybe 15% speed boost or something. Heres the thing, you dont loose your abilities in the next episode. So it may start out by one person being just abit faster but by the end, people have these builds of insanely op abilitys. But the twist is every episode, the mobs do more and more damage and have more and more health to bring challenge. just a thought but i think it would be sick!
"Gather things, eat it" - Grian 2024
Mumbo "I just ate my seeds" 🤨
grain time
making it so the food gets randomised multiple times is so menacing and mischievous
Bro I saw mumbos videos recommendation , since then I'm waiting for grian😂😂😭😭
"I JUST ATE MY SEEDS" -Mumbo 2024
Bro ate well
(:
Soon the british big boys will arise.
The way I saw mumbos on my page and immediately searched up grians videos
Skizz becoming Mary Poppins!!!😂😂😂
I waited all week for this, really excited!!!
50:15 Jeez skiz, can’t be saying that.
MUMBO HAS A WAFLE. I REPEAT, MUMBO HAS A WAFFLE ONCE MORE
Grian posting late, as usual!!
Grian, i got a idea for a base a villainess base suites for that place right above the drip stone.
A one block hole in the floor is gonna be this seasons greatest anti grian trap
4:49 “I just ate my seeds”😂
i decided to not sleep and im early to a grian vid its a good day
Wildcard idea: Is the moon big?   After the wildcard is activated, the moon begins growing at a rapid pace, causing low gravity and tremors throughout the world
Watching others was fun whilst waiting for you to upload this masterpiece series!! 💗
keeping up with all these pov’s while also having to watch mcc on the same day is not good for my health.
just in time for me to watch while working on an art project--nice :D
"I just ate my seeds!" - Mumbo Jumbo 2024
Why do I feel like Mumbo is going to become a hermit living in a small cave paranoid… Wait he already is-
Literally drinking my tea to this
life series videos always make my week
everyone saying "first" but no one saying "last"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             what are you doing here smh...
Mumbo has a waffle again 🤨
i think this is the earliest i've ever been
8 MINUTES GANG LESGO
*It would be better for everyone involved if everyone got different wildcards. if you watch one person then you know what everyone will get and watching their point of view wont be as interesting*
Mumbo needs to take some deep breaths 😌
We would love you to join us for a bite...
AYYYY EP 2 WOOO!!
I'm so happy there's a new life series 🎉❤
STARVED LIFE 😱😱😱
Awsome 🎉❤😊
Thank you
10 minute gang
loving the skizz-grian-mumbo trio (AKA. The sub 1 club)
RIP sub one club. You will be missed 😭
early yay
I love this series so much, because we don't know what to expect! Thanks a lot Grian for these videos and the smp. :)
Just saw the thumbnail.. GRIAN IS YOUR STOMACH OKAY
David Attenborough - now once again you can see the wild grain is trying to make content
Yay finally its so sad waiting and watching all the other People post lol
Man I can't wait for a series where you gain hearts by hurting people, like lifesteal
Here to enjoy at first ten minutes of release
I wish the wild cards would stay the next episode, so we could still have the comedic gold of the sub-1 club...
cornbread
Spoiler shield 🛡️
33:22 That has to be a record for the fastest anyone has ever gone from disagreeing to being in wholeheartedly 😂
So basically this session everyone has pica.
"My surname is Jumbo" omg 😭😭😭
Best series fr
Ooh 5mins, good thing I haven't slept yet it's 1 am🫡
Under 30 minute club 👇
Woah 5 minutes
Great vid!
BEST WAY TO WAKE UPP ❤❤❤
I'm so excited
Just finished catching up with your hermitcraft episodes, glad that a new wild life episode came out right after!
Bro makes my day 😊
The person named Well: 😨
Grian why are you alway late, I want to see you perspectiver first!
Love this series so far
GET OUTTTT!! dumbledore said calmly
I'm so happy this series is back!!!
Another vid, YAY!
surely the no-longer Sub Ones still stay together…right???
Banana Bread
If you are reading this you have not finished the video🙅
I love Grian and Hermitcraft.
Grian
Having already seen Mumbos perspective, this session was chaos. Also no idea if theres still time for wildcard suggestions but I would love it if the proporties of water and lava switched but they still looked the same.
YIPPEE
LETS GO MORE WILD LIFE
What zanny hijinks are gonna happen this episode?
I have to watch as everyone else in wild life uploads ep 2 meanwhile I wait 5 HOURS
I'm debating between watching this and Matpats final YouTube video stream
Thousands of views, 4 minutes after launch.
54 MIN LIFE EPISODES??? HELL YEAHH
Next episode people going to have different gravity, step 10 blocks instantly, infinite or random block or entity reach using attributes and I'm all here for it
Wildcard Idea: May have already been done somewhere, but something as simple as every 5 minutes or so, every player swaps location and just teleports to where someone else was. Would make for some interesting scenarios in groups and alliances!
I clicked on this faster than zanzibar surrendered to the British in 1896
YAY, THIS JUST MADE MY DAY!!! I WAS IN SUCH A POOR MOOD AND THIS HELPED A LOT
Bald
42:45 "Btw if you eat my balls" almost made me slam my head on my desk out of laughter
YAYAYAYAYAYYY
🥳🥳🥳 WILD LIFE 2 YEAH!!!!
If mumbo wanted to keep floating in their name (for some reason) they could have called themselves the buoyancy bridgers or buoyancy bridge boys
Not so sub ones anymore
BIGb, mumbo JUMBO, intheLITTLEwood... the sub one club seems a little hypocritical... LOL
Wild Life Episode 1: Paranoia  Wild Life Episode 2: The Paranoia returns
1 hour gang👇
Under 5 minuete gang
They should SO have a different group name every week based on the wild card!
0:59 Paranoid Mumbo arc

All in favor of the floaters
You know it’s a good day when grian uploads
Within 5 mins l                        V
I think Grian is the ore snatcher

Hi Grian
Yeah! Go Spanners! 😂
Early bird gets the worm ahh situation

Wild idea: When you hit someone, their current item that they are holding gets swapped out with another item from their inventory. If they aren’t holding anything then your item gets transferred to them and you end up with nothing. If both people have nothing then nothing happens

Wild cards so far   THIS IS A WALL TO PROTECT YOU FROM GETTING SPOILED    Episode 1: Shifting makes you shrink and jumping makes you grow  Episode 2: Everyone has starvation 3 and they can eat anything and it also gives you random effects, also you need real food to gain hunger bars and if you dont you only get an effect (food also gets randomized sometimes)
WHY DOES GRIAN HAVE TOVPOST AT THE SAME TIKE MATPAT LAST GTLIVE IS GOING LIVE 😭
