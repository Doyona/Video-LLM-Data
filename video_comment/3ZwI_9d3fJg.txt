Absolute 💩
😴Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Why do so many England fans at the Andorra game have their faces painted like mini roundabouts?.
Training match . Our 3 best players not there so all you haters go watch netball
England for years now end up playing the usual suspects in world cup qualifiers, countries like this should be playing in a far less qualifying group than the top table as no one wins and why do England get tied with crap countries in the first place
Does not Instill me with Confidence for the World Cup! Let's face it! It's not coming home!!!
LIONESSES SHOULD BE ON MORE WAGES THAN THE LIONS LOL 😂😂😂😂😂😂
NEED LESSONS FROM THE LIONESSES 😂😂😂😂😂 THEY KNOW HOW TO WINNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
0:47 possibly the worst touch of all time
Give Andorra  credit they didn't concede more then 5
Why can’t we just be supportive of our team for once? No matter how we perform you always have every England fan hating on our team, may not have been a great match but it’s qualifiers… not a World Cup final.
England vs Andorra
the ego on some of these players, man... they don't want to give any effort because they aren't playing in front of a packed stadium of 30,000+
Four shots on target in the first half. Against Andorra. Unbelievably poor from England.
“We’re playing Andorra, we should be looking to score 6 or 7”.
Guys, relax. If this is your result against the 173rd team in the world just think of the bloodbath you'll experience against the big boys.
Just get Lee Carsley back
How itv found more than 1 minute of highlights is impressive.
Tuchel tried James on the left but surely the best squad has James on the right and Trent inverting on the left? I’ve always thought England could try this but it would require Foden or Palmer being in the left 8. Think the link up between Jude, Saka and James could be interesting
See how mad was shutting palmer dowm though. Didnt even let him go with it
I will save you some time...There were no highlights....🤣🤣🤣
Struggling against a team ranked 173rd made up of plumbers and fruit sellers. Wow, how the mighty have fallen. I would make a witty joke but this is just pathetic.
Noni looking sharp for next season! 💙
Cmon England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 🇬🇧. Congratulations Harry Kane.
How have you managed to turn this into a 10 minute video?
Having seen the 2nd half of the Portugal v Spain game,  England don't stand a chance of winning the WC 26.  It will be the usual England stumbling through the group stages and then LOSING to the first classy side in the KO stages.  Glad I saw us win in 66 when I was 10.  We still lack really world  class players as apart from maybe Palmer.  My opinion of course.
England always plays these pub teams we should be playing the best teams .
We've got the wrong manager again!!!
Get some players on the chopping blocks then Tuchel, you have a ton to pick from, drop people, show them you mean business!
Brilliant 👍

A lot of people being dramatic in the comments as per usual.   No, it wasn’t a great game. Okay, we didn’t play anywhere near our best but we still won playing in first gear.   A lot of the players have come off the back of long seasons and are carrying injuries - combine that with the heat and a dry pitch and what else do you expect?

Just a small reminder, that's Andorra not Germany or Brazil. Most of Andorra's players have a 9-5 job too while England's players a professionals paid millions. So winning 1-0 ... I would say it's not so much of an achievement!

I totally get it that trying to 'get up' for the mighty Andorra is not easy, but that was a truly shocking display and why is Jordan Henderson anywhere near an England squad, the mind boggles.  I've just watched the Spain Portugal game and we are miles behind them both. Not so much in talent but it hurts me to say it, but desire. We need to improve our mentality or it will be going home from the US as soon as we face the likes of France or Argentina. I don't think any honest Englishman can see us beating 3 of very top nations in succession and that's just a fact.

Same England - different manager.  No different to the last 40 years or so with top professionals playing a very poor First Division game.   We played a few games under Carsley, and aside from that one blip when the team didn't show up - we were outstanding with exciting attacking football.  Then we took on Tuchel and I have a feeling.... (Southgate part 2 - except we won't get anywhere in the championship games)

Sorry, So the future of English football in the midfield....is Henderson? I could go out to the leagues, starting premiership and below and find "100" better midfielders than Henderson. I don't blame Henderson. This manager has already proven he can't motivate these players.

For a team that goes into every tournament as so-called ‘favourites’, only beating Andorra by one goal is a disgrace!!! We should be ruthless with teams like this if we want to be beating France, Spain, Argentina etc

What highlights? Another disappointing,dismal performance. We are running out of top class English players simply because we have far too many average foreign players in the Premier League. Foreign managers and owners are proof that traditional English football is dying and will never be able to recover.

Only 1 nil. Against Andorra. I expected england to beat Andorra 3 or 4 nil even on a bad day
Tuchel will not win anything with England. No offence to Andorra but this should have been a 4+ goal win. England will go out in the last 16. England should have stuck with Carsley, he knew the team, he knew the players and he knew how to win trophies.
Dan Burns was terrible. His distribution was league 2.
Glad I didn't watch it forgot it was on
1-0 what a joke England man don’t be going to no f1 events or any event for that matter you have no chance of beating some of the top clubs in the world it’s a shame man you guys prefer the money and fame then to play as a team it’s a joke
Amazing that itv could get 9 minutes of highlights from this dross....
Highlights. ??????????
Foden was the problem 🤔
Boring, clueless performance. Another dreadful defensive manager seeking a fat pay cheque for mediocrity, just like Gormless Gareth.
Angel Gomes should be in this squad. A proper number 6/8 regista.
I think Bellingham is over rated he is given the ball all the time but never does anything with it and if he doesn't get the ball he gets frustrated
Come on England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Kanr took 3-5 business days to get back up..... but still slotted it home
The fact the Esp vs Fra highlights were under 6 mins and the game finished 5-4 vs 9mins for a 1-0 dead game is crazy 😂
1nill what's a disappointment
When will people wake up and realise we fluked our way to the last few finals. Southgate's football was coma-inducing but our players really aren't all that.
A Convincing crushing victory,  £10 on England to win the world Cup now .
What Roy keen sead was correct but I do object to an Irish man criticising England no other country would put up with it can you imagine an English man criticising Scotland but we put up with it
After watching the Rugby League Final and then switching over channels to watch this bag of mashing.  No comparison.
A wins a win. You British melts love to moan.
Utter pish.
You would genuinely think England lost this game judging by the comments 😂😂 just because we didn’t score more than 5, we have to criticise the team?😂😂 awful fans
How are the highlights over 9 minutes? 30 seconds would have covered it 😉#uttershite
These millionaires aren’t hungry enough. Time to get rid & choose players from lower divisions.
This video is just over 9 minutes 5 seconds. Could've just been 9.5 seconds.
You could argue that Tuchel is just ‘experimenting’, but let’s be real: England scored only ONE goal against Andorra! Andorra of all nations. England got a better result out of Albania and Latvia than this. This is just sad. Very sad.
These highlights should take 15 seconds 😂 Tuchel out
Never shoulda got rid of Southgate I said we’d live to regret it
I forgot there was a game. Hopefully I'll forget the next one too.
Mgw comes on makes all the difference  for 3 minutes and still will get benched to Henderson
LOL. I couldn't find any offical highlights of Spain 5-4 France on Youtube over 3 mins!!
zzzzzzzzzz....
Typical England , 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 😂😂😂😂
England are cursed for taking the knee . Never will be or amount to anything . Players with no morals .
What a load of crap, is it any wonder we haven't won the World Cup for 59 years! Too much emphasis on Premier league and f.... England as a team. Stands out a mile. they should by paid by result. How much did people pay to watch this ?  They were scammed.
Ahhhh, England with a “big name” manager are now going to fade back into round of 16/quarter final obscurity, aren’t they?
We are the best National side in the world……………………. at walking football. 😴
Didn't take long for Tucel to sound like other England managers...
My heat huh anon Emma, not let no none I like football and I'm not in man an alarm in them, ha ha ha ha ha ha.
🚿 of 💩
4 minutes of kicking a ball 5 minutes of waffling, may aswell change title to england interview ft some football
Toilet , I mo I like football in then actually had in the men my home Not hurt ma

I'm sorry mom you are so sweet 💖💖💖💖💖
Well at least they paid us the compliment of blatantly time wasting at every restart.
0:54 Jones is so average
This was such a dead game bro
So boring
Madueke 😂😂😂 how is this guy even close to the team?
What an embarrassment.  Was starmer in charge?
9 minutes of ‘highlights’? Now that’s creative
YES
The FA haven't learnt anything  Changing the manager hasn't accomplished nothing.  Even fans with little knowledge can figure out what's wrong
Harry Kane paying tribute to Sven Goran Eriksson with that barnet
Heres a tip to Tuchel :- watch the full match between Inter and PSG or even Barcelona v PSG... Thats how football should be played by PSG, fast fast fast and incredible first time touches, not arm up in the air by Henderson, receives the ball then passes it back to the same player, awful player, aging and slow and ponderous and.....
In France mostly French, in Germany mostly German , in Spain mostly Spanish , in Britain mostly foreign , say no more .
nine minutes  of highlights!!!
Highlights??
Post match interviews were as long as and more exciting than the highlights.
When did MR BURNS become England manager.   EXCELLENT 😂😂😂 🏐🥅⚽♥️
10 min video for 1-0 win over andorra
Me thinks the FA have messed up again,big kin time,Dan Byrne Henderson you've got to be Avin a right laugh. Pitiful performance from an average team.
Rubbish!!!!
Get Henderson straight out and take kane with him
Just here to see the people who wanted Southgate sacked  whinging...
Avalanche of goals?
It’s coming home!!!
Curtis jones, that touch 😂
Wasn't any highlights kane is finished Henderson to terrible game Bellingham overrated
Highlights? What highlights?
Is there a worse commentary pair than Matterface and Dixon
9 minutes of highlights? Your having a laugh 😂
For the england players this just seemed like an annoying distraction from their luxury holidays...
What a disgrace. Not worth watching. No chance of winning anything with this lot and manager
Highlight what highlights.England will never win anything.
Let's be honest....this is embarrassing.
9 minutes of highlights? Really?
Didn't even realise the game was on, only read about it, that's how pointless this match was. The people moaning should ask themselves why after a long season of football they want to spend their spare time watching a pointless game where the England squad are tired and winding down. How can you possibly be motivated for such a match.
How on earth did you find 9mins 53secs of highlights from this boring dross ?
Its clear Tuchel isn't calling the shots.  The FA's corruption must be purjed.
I have now lost hope for the world cup now after seeing this performance.
I didn’t think this would be on in the UK!
I’ve seen Sunday morning games better than this
How can you make 9 minute highlights from this boring game 😂
“Highlights”? “An avalanche of goals”? Haha well played sir!
0.00 Welcome to the highlights show.. 0.03 ..the end
I could have bring 5
You should try being Scottish.  I am Scottish by the way.
Highlights.... lol...! 😂
What highlights,I must have blinked
It was sad performance by the England players. They do not appear to have any imagination  on the ball. Not aware where their players are and who to pass too. I some time wonder if we used slightly less known players in the lower leagues they would have a lot more fire in there bellies to fight hard and win big
Wow, that was absolutely atrocious. Just when you think you can't get a more boring team to watch than a Southgate team, Tuchel has managed it already in the space of 3 games against 3 of the worst teams in the world. Embarrassing and pathetic. These over-hyped, overpaid stain of players have zero pride and Tuchel looks clueless at this point.
Can’t wait to not watch England in the World Cup already. 😴😴😴
For most of this game I thought Southgate was still in charge!
Tuchel isn't the answer. He won a champions league and thats about it
What a rubbish game of football!! Probably worse game of football I’ve watched bar Tottenham vs Man U europa final!
MOTM - Iker
Henderson 🤣 the whole reason we lost vs italy in final.. rice > henderson = lose
Highlights  !!!! Hilarious.
4 minutes of highlights 5 mins of interviews 😂
Nice to hear that hes honest and open about the performance.
Highlights!
One highlight for me was the final whistle and when the overpaid English wasters walked off the pitch.
We had our chance. The quality isn't there now. Be lucky to get through to the qf's at the wc
I think Andorra only had they’re family members as fans, all i could see was English fans
Sack. The. Manager.
Tuchell was not a happy man and he made it crystal clear he wasn’t happy. His post match interview had a dig at his big time charlies
This is why i cba to watch england games , there always so boring 😴
Not sure if highlights is the right word.
I think many of us were looking forward to seeing what Tuchel did. Henderson on the pitch, Madueke on the pitch, and players playing in the wrong position… some very bad signs already.
The highlight was walking onto the pitch 😂😊
There’s  highlights?🤣
What happened just sat down to watch the match then nothing!
How can you put up 10 mins of highlights, 10 secs would do, England were Garbage, ( as usual )
Sorry but this is worse than Southgate era... You lot happy you got him out still? 🤦🤷‍♂️  "Get rid of him and England win something" never thought this generation would struggle against Andorra
The most boring game I think I have ever watched! No passion
Madueke honestly may have been my man of the match with this rubbish England team at the moment
Didn't even know we was playing 😂😂
About 9 minutes too long that video
Looking at these comments makes me realise that my decision to only watch the actual competitions was the right way to go. I have got better things to do.
You all wanted rid of Southgate and foden 👍🤣🤣🤣🤣
Come on what we scapegoating now foden wasn’t playing???
Highlights......i think you meant lowlights.
England should've scored way more, disappointing 😢
Highlight was the crowd singing "Keir Starmer's a w⚓".
Bellingham must be the most overrated player in history. Kane is a proper world class player
Embarrassing highlights, obviously needed to fill some time in so added in a couple of irrelevant interviews, which never happens in a highlight video  Also England are pish
They look tired
How have you got 10 minutes of highlights from this? Just because it’s England doesn’t mean it’s worth watching.
Hope all the gammons who watched this fell akip 😂😂😂  One boring team this lot 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🐽😴
Another useless England manager. Picking Henderson says it all. Pathetic
Gosh ...useless
That's worse than the Scots result! 1 of our players earns more in a year than the Andorra entire squad!
Some of the England team look like they are afraid of losing.
Kane is amazing 🎉
Such a great prospect for the World Cup as always so much creative flare and enthusiasm and clinical finishing from the over payed over hyped so called professionals in the England team these days
KIER STARMERS A
‘They will be Eyeing up an avalanche of goals here.’ 😂
the frustration for me was watching the old style passing across the back for no reason. Also, not enough taking on players, trying to pass it into goal.
Presently I’m not sure of tuchels squad odd  selections and the 11 weird team selection….Henderson I don’t get at all??. For me Andorra was the perfect setting to blend in new with our first class younger mature players. And as for central midfielders we have a lot of very capable players to fill that role, so I just didn’t get Henderson selection at all 😮😮😮😮ps my response to tuchels lack of performance quote, that’s really easy to answer…..like Wokegate, you keep selecting the wrong team line ups, testing players I do get, however when you get to play the top tier teams, we are stuffed 100% as you then need to field the max strongest 11 same for the subs. Just my views on the basis your 👀 eyes don’t lie. 😂. Time will tell presently I just don’t see it, we have an abundance of elitist top tier young English players, so simple very USE EM…and in the right order.
''Highlights''
Struggling against farmers and electricians 😢😢😢😢😢
3 points is 3 points though.
Whats with the turtlenecks
I don't watch England games anymore. There's hardly anything English about it these days.
tough crowd 🤣
Another disasterous World Cup coming up for England 😂
YAWN!!!!!
The equivalent of Sunday league teams are so hard to beat well done England it's coming home if we get out this usual group of death we seem to find ourselves in
I've watched better Sunday league, watching England is like watching paint dry 😢
I only hear about Andorra when they play football. Does anybody know where this country is? What language do they speak 😅
Absolutely no excuses...Andorra only have a population of 328 and 126 of them are sheep my sister roger(half back) and uncle mark(right wing) also my great aunt....twice removed...from the sheep.
Shameful they brag England up they this and that but only managed to beat Andorra by 1 nil. Lol 🤣
Like watching the English league agine  befoe the foreigners and Saudi and American money
What are english players combined weekly wages ?
some avalanche of goals from the commentator at start of video.Clown
Suprised anyone could make any highlights of that game
Turned this game off after 60 minutes.
Wow 1 nil against the mighty Andorra
Hahah we are well and truly f*c*d
no saka and all the creativity disappears
Should be 5 - 0, awful
SOUTHGATE OUT!!   Oh…wait…
MGW needs to have more time on the pitch. Comes on for 2 minutes and assists what should have been a goal.
Poor. Where is Grealish and Foden
Kane: Listen to his pathetic excuses. The whole team is a f*****g joke. Starting with the pillock that no manager has the guts to tell "you're not playing Harry"
Comments are hilarious! Playing Qualifying games in June after a long season is bullshit for the players. We did what we needed to do.
Awful match   Madueke was the only glimmer in an otherwise somber setting
Diabolical. If Southgate took us back to Dark Ages, then Tuchel is talking us back to the Jurassic period.
Shambles
Look at that group englands  in the only one that's missing is the dog and duck pub team
I was miserable after  Fridays result against Iceland  england cheered me up on  saturday
What an embarrassment  !     Against a team of goat hoarders . No heart no guts , no passion . Lifeless .  A complete disgrace !
Best downs sydrome player of alls time. Inspirational
How did they find 10 minutes worth of highlights lol. Watching paint dry was more thrilling 😅
I'd rather watch my big toe for a week.. same old bore fest. Every time.
Overrated england
Whys this german turning us into the Chelsea B team
Didn't realise Andorra's home ground is Elland road
A glorious, unforgettable victory
My Sunday League Divvy 4 team would do better than England 😂😂
Haryy Kane , `gave them energy.` The Andorra players have came of a 36 hr week and some will be back work in the morning fixing bogs. That was painful.
How we got 9 mins of `Highlights` out of that ITV is beyond me.? That was spectacularly awful.
Highlights commentary is awful
England is England
My dream line up -  Gordon (LW), Watkins, Saka (RW) Cole Palmer (10) Rice (6) Jude(8) Skelly Burn Konsa Trent               Pickford
Tuchel has got NO idea.
Why do they play henderson still? unusual.
The highlights should’ve been about 18 seconds long
When will us English realise we are not world class compared to Spain,France we are mediocre
Get Jordan Henderson away from that team! He's dogshite!
Gibbs white needs more play time. That ball at the end was fantastic
Utterly pathetic result
Andorra's level is like a 3 division club in England.
"world class Kane" scores again against massive opposition" Oh wait Andorra has a total population of about 60k lol
1:25 “Yh watch this, absolutely brilliant” about Rogers😂it’s only Andorra in 12 months time you gonna flop mate
It's all about tactics.
With how England played against the equivalent of a Sunday league team they should just give up on playing in the WC, they don't deserve to play with their poor performance and attitude.
Christ we look even worse, that golden chance to bring a major trophy home has certainly gone again for another 10-15 years ffs😂😂
Blaming the weather typical England
Legendary game
madueke had an open goal at the end and decided to pass it across the box. 😂
I genuinely think non league sides would put up a better showing
Kids these days, England either beat teams like Andorra by 6 goals and people say its only Andorra and England are trash, or they beat them by 1 goal and say England are trash 🤡🤡
Tuchel will do fine trust a chelsea supporter. How he won the champs with that team and only conceding 4 goals is just crazy
Didn’t realise this match was on…..so pleased I didn’t put myself thru another England snooze fest!
The money England players are on want to be a shamed of there self's
Dreadful
Madueke made all the difference. Enough said.
It was hot and the pitch was dry. Nice one Harry, and there was me thinking we were crap. My mistake.
Wow that was an avalanche of goal….. 😂
And most had criticised Southgate managerial.
Nobody runs with the ball, no dribbling, no wingers. Just pass, pass, pass to get nowhere. Borefest.
What an impact this German Ole Gunner Solkjaer has had
What absolute rubbish ,that’s what we have to live witn boys with such an awful manager …….Howe for England
Didn't even know this match happened today.
At this rate Tuchel will be gone before the world cup
Madueke and Gordon couldn’t finish there dinner. useless sausages.
Just think if Howe was manager it would have gone in,simply would have gone in!
you only get 3 points for a win.. so how you win is irrelevant
Nice assist from KSi to Currypain.
I had full trust in this England team, so 10 minutes into the first half I decided to fall asleep, knowing that I would wake up to an England victory - I was right!
Was so confused when I saw these highlights were almost 10 mins long
If they cant score more goals againsr Andorra what chance against a team that can play football, usuall excuses maybe not as talented as they think
Not keen on those Star Trek neckline on those England shirts.
Don’t get me wrong because at the end of the day a win is a win but….what a complete load of *Bovine Scatology* .  💩
International football is boring
"DISGRACEFUL" England Team were  Unwatchable ,No wonder the stadium was Empty!1
whos idea was tunchel as manager
i really like madueke. always helping. great player. !
Absolutely dreadful, played so slow even this bunch of part timers could defend. Why is Henderson still in this squad and why didn’t Rice start? Ridiculous!!
Might aswel have lost 😂 dayum we were bad
Madueke provided played quite Well but man has no right foot , practice with it lad every day !
Embarrassing, I think the only hope for England is by getting a lucky draw and getting a fluke win in the semis and final. There are far better teams than us at the minute sadly.
What is the point of Andorra football wise?.
Come on England! 💪🏽💪🏽
Great to see a decent length highlight video rather than the usual 3 mins or less!
What is the point of England playing against this level of opponents?  E
MGW gets two minutes and plays the pass of the game.
Please get rid of Sam 'Alan Partridge' Matterface. He's dreadful and he's had a chance.
Different manager, same crap
Madueke just ran the show
Had no idea England were playing.
Kane is past it. Palmer has been crap for months. Hendo is old. Burns should never wear an England shirt. And I could go on.
Not quite the spain france match 😂
How can this be an english side anymore? They're mostly african now lol...
Spoilt brats
Absolute embarrassment. Tuchel won't win England the world cup
Overpaid pathetic pretenders...1-0
I didn't know Andorra was so good!!1 I guess being between Spain and France benefits them!
Noni maduaeke is a championship level player,  headless chicken,  poor version of sterling.
These 10 minute highlights are 9 minutes too long..
That was a proper avalanche of goals
To play a team that sits 11 men behind the ball is not easy.  They need to really ban half these non countries from competing.  Make the world cup top 30 teams only with actual footballers.
Switch off against England and they’ll punish you.
Same old England, Kane too old Hendo needs to retire, manu, the only one who did anything this game! We’ll get decimated with this team in the World Cup playing like this! 😂
I prefer the 8pm kick offs for England games. It’s the best sleeping pill ever. Knocks me right out until morning.
Looks like playing at Everton's new stadium
That was better than a southgate match 🤣😂🤣
The Fa really messed up not taking on Carsley. He new all of the youngsters and how to get the best out of them. This tournament is almost a free hit as its a rebuilding fase, so why not put him in now to build for the future instead of the 18 month contract German. Thats no disrespect to the TT hes a great manager but no foreign coach has won the WC
Why is Henderson playing
Why bring Gibs White on for only 2 mins?   He's a team player!....
What highlights?,I’ve never saw any.
Henderson has more caps than Hoddle.......
Highlights?  Shouldn't this video be 25 seconds long?
Not the best showing from England again 😅If you’re into real football moments and goals from the pitch-level view, I’ve been posting full games and highlights from local matches on my channel.  Check it out @DKWAYN3 – drop a like or comment to support it ⚽📹
Spain would have scored 3 minimum
Grass may not be greener after Southgate....I guess we will find out. One thing is for sure Jordan Henderson and Dan Burns should be nowhere near the squad.
We played in flip flops, they’re on the beach, it’s Andorra, who cares. Turn up when it counts and judge then.
dry pitch
Do I dare watch these 10 minutes?
What a terrible display from England. Yes we won but there will be other teams at the WC who might expose our midfield. 😂
What a shower yet another clueless performance from a clueless manager😴
Let's hope England have another easy draw in the next World Cup and avoid Spain, France , Germany, Portugal, Argentina, Brazil, Belgium and Italy en  route to the final.
didn’t watch the game can someone fill me in i’m seing people say it was tragic
We all know the countries that will qualify with the odd exception. Remember when friendlies were intense? Not now, FIFA have made these rounds boring beyond belief!
Nearly ten minutes of lowlights. There were two highlights. The goal and the final whistle!
Utterly embarrassing from England. The result felt like a victory for Andorra. This is what you get for putting out an experimental side. Only 6 goals from a possible 16 in 3 games. This like watching football under Carsley and the last couple or so years under Southgate.
So poor game for England...barely 0:1...really bad game
I didn't miss much. Only ever watch England in tournaments !
Give the editor a raise for pulling together 9mins+ worth of highlights from this shitshow😂
A huge win...for the betting companies! share it out!
i cant even find Andorra on the map
Didn’t bother with the second half…utter sheet.
how can they drag this match to nearly 10 minutes is my biggest concern
Shyte
Tuchel sent by the Germans for revenge on England
Spursy fc. England fans shouldn’t waste their money paying thousands of pounds to travel to America to watch this dross.
awful performance despite dominating them. come on England. you need to do better.
Same old same old. Usual boring rubbish from an inadequate team of overpaid prima donnas. I worked for 50 years in industry and in all that time didn't earn what one of football's high earners get in a month. Not sure if I can be bothered to watch anymore.
Not enough forward balls and runs, England surely not 4th best team in the world.
90% of the time the ball went forward to rogers he played it back again. was he scared of taking on mighty andorran left back? And why even bother with us having a left back and right back, they never got forward.
This match would have put a Glass eye to sleep 😂😂😂
Same old pick 3 players who play the same position and wonder why it’s a cluster ****.
Why was Henderson playing? Tuchel is Southgate continuation.....
Awful
PATHETIC! Kane is a yard too slow and shouldn't even be in the squad,
I said ages ago that we were better off sticking with Lee Carsley. We played beautiful attacking football under him. It's not too late to bring him back. Tuchel is giving me Fabio Cappello vibes, where we had an amazing team of players, but could only come up with 1-0 wins in many games.
I’m not gonna go on about the selection of Burn and Henderson. England will win nothing for the next few years, I promise you, France have improved, Spain are insane, Germany are solid, I could go on and on. This kind of performance should shock everybody back to reality.
Millionaires being lazy. A 5 year old kid could strike a ball better than most of those on that field today…
only one player turned up Madueke.
This is England not Chelsea fc stop picking favourites just because you managed them before there is players that deserve it more like timo for Newcastle and Jacob Murphy and how you don’t even take saka to play is just wrong and rashford should be in the squad we called Southgate out for picking favourites so you need calling out to
Shameful
Where were the highlights?
The sooner club football is back the better.
A qualifier against Andorra just after the football season has ended. Yeah I don't think I'd be putting my greatest performance either!
This team wont make it past the round of 16
it was a disgusting , degrading on behalf of england, no wonder the england fans slagging starmer off, and half these players wouldnt get into a scout team
A cure for insomniacs?! Watch this game & if that fails watch the Spurs v Man utd Europa League Final.🥱😴
You underpay your video editor who could find 10 minutes of highlights in this match
Where’s Southgate to blame??
that gibbs white pass deserved a goal
4:18 gibbswhite unbelievable pass, only on the pitch for 2 minutes. Must Start On Tuesday.
Well, I have been watching our England teams since the 70s, and yes, I understand we are playing a team that will just defend and our players have had a long season but when did we start playing walking football.Managers like Terry Venables and Bobby Robson would be cringing watching that.Slow passing, no first time passess as they have to control the ball with at least 2 touches before they pass it nearly all the time sideways again.No intensity,no sprinting,no running off the ball.We were always told when you pass the ball you move.This was Andorra, yes I did say Andorra.To think we used to have players like Keegan, Robson, Waddle, Scholes and world class Gazza.We don't have one player with flair that can change a game.I will accept any critism if I am wrong but that was utter garbage.
One of worst England game ever
England players are disrespectful and so are the fans. When England players received their silver medals four years ago, they all removed them from their necks immediately. Who do they think they are? Be grateful for even making a final. Bad losers. Getting slapped in America next year. Can’t even beat America in major tournaments.
And they’ll say what they’ve said since the dawn of football using the truism “It’s all about the points and the win’.
I like tuchel man he speaks sense
MGW did more in 3 minutes than Henderson did all match
Tuchel's team cant score goals. The days of getting to the semis amd finals are over.
The players diet needs to changed from a Western diet to a more of a Mediterranean diet, our diet is affecting stamina and pace of our play. Unless a massive overhaul happens with the Englands diet we won't win anything. Sugars and carbs isn't the way to fuel exercise
Grandad tap in still in the team then.Thought he had retired to the German league.
Half of these highlights were post match interviews.   Has anyone ever seen this before? Crazy.
Squeezing 9 min of highlights from this match deserves some kind of nobel prize. Monumental effort.
If you ever pick Jordon Henderson, you need to wonder where you went wrong in life. Worst pick he has made in his career
Ian!
Highlights! 🤣🤣
My mates said we will batter them 7 -0 but we got 10 -0 mins of highlights instead 😂
Henderson should not be there at all, even against Andorra. It's time to move on.
Does it really matter? 3 points does.
Breaking news. Star studded England defeat the part timers on there day off 1-0!
9 minutes....at least 8 too many
Shockingly bad!! England worse under Tuchel than Southgate, France Spain and Portugal are far better teams. I fear England have lost their chance to win a Trophy
Tuchel is not the guy
England pathetic never going to win anything
England could barely beat a country with a population equivalent to the town of Grimsby.  Pathetic.
Andorra will win world cup easy
Despite gaining 3 points, England lost today
What highlghts most boring match  today if this is what england have to look forward to we have gone back over
Someone explain what rice did better than Henderson when he came on😂 stunk up the gaff yet is meant to be world class😭
That ball from MGW 😍
tragedy
England just about beat Andorra 😂
Zero gile as usual !! Running at pace as individuals, there are no interchanges with the ball. No glory in my lifetime. I've accepted that fact !
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz…😊
I really don’t get us English fans, we’re moaning even tho we still won? Regardless if there’s over 160 odd places in the rankings, we won the match, tuchel clearly wasn’t happy with the performance either but for crying out loud man, just get behind the team, we will qualify, all that matters is we turn up for the actual tournament (easier said than done when it’s England we’re talking about) and we will see what happens.
Why all the negatives???? It's always the same . We play it's a win ...U can't win every game 20.0..v weaker team .  Stop moaning !!!!!!! Melanie 35🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿♥️
0:09 "they will be eyeing up an avalanche of goals here" - okay buddy.
uses are worst than SCOTLAND
Whoever Found 10 Minutes Highlights Of This Deserves A Medal
Some folk calling for Southgate to come back that's how bad this was 😒
Postives - plenti of attempts on goal  Negatives - very wasteful on goal, missing easy chances....struggling to beat andorra and weaker opposition by 1 goal.  Against elite teams with this performance its a loss, needs to improve.
Hi
World class 😂😂😂
Even the goal had a great deal of fortune about it...Kane did his best to sky it!
I saw Jordan Henderson at the beginning and switched off
The part-timers did very well against the multimillionaire 'professional' footballers from England.
I gave up with the England football team a while back. Sad to see.
🕌🕌🕌🕌🕌
German coach 😂
MADUEKE should start as LM next Tuesday with Saka as RM
The most entertaining thing about this is the comment section 👌
Hahahaha.  Oh my, I'm English and this is embarrassing.  🫤
It's coming home 😂
HARRY KANE WILL CONTINUE TO BREAK RECORDS.🌟.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Different manager same rubbish with team selection. Why is Henderson playing? And why did we have a right back at left back when you've got Miles Lewis Skelly, who has played so well all season?
Watching paint dry was better than watching this garbage
The team selection was riddiculous.  Where was Walker, Foden, Saka, Maddison, Alexander.
What a disgraceful lazy performance by England. They just don't care.
We’re there really 9 minutes of highlights?
The goal was offside a mile.
embarrassing today
Even tho we played bad in my opinion maduake actualy played well
So boring. Its a real turn off
Bring back Southgate please 😢
I really need to watch somthing to help me sleep, this was perfect, so borring...
The way the highlights are you would think England had an unlucky day wth
Same old England pass it sideways then backwards and when the opposition attack panic like mad.
We gave them confidence, we gave them energy - nothing new there then.
Great performance by the boys today, a supremely mature gritty display away at a very tough away day, this 3 points is massive, looking like a really solid team torwards the world cup, looking really hard to break down.          Said no one.
That Curtis Jones ball before the goal was sexy!
The Kane syndrome blinded the managers to look for better options around them. Football can be likened to a strategic chase game, to achieve success and win trophies, the manager  must be willing to be cruel.
This is turning out exactly as I thought, I never wanted Tuchel not because he’s Jewish but because his football is no different to South Gate or Deschamps. It’s horrible.
Thomas is a very poor  choice of manager .To pick Henderson is just beyond a joke and this performance was dire.
Wait? There were highlights?!
A 10 minute highlight for such a bore game is a surprise 😮
'Highlights'?? 🤣 Should be sued under the trades description act 🤣
Just win...end of
We will get demolished by spain btw
Is coming home Believe me ❤❤❤
Can someone tell me what happened to saka and why Trent didn’t start and why Henderson started like I’d rather play skelly in midfield
So so boring switched off half time extremely poor
How tf have u made this shithouse a 9+ min vid
This confirms one clear thing... Andorra are getting better
Got rid of Southgate for this dross 😭😭😭
Not a great performance. But 3 points is all that matters
should come with a warning viewer discretion required, we want to show highlights so here is the ball boy giving the ball back
Southgate ball
Can’t believe they got any highlights out of this rubbish.
what a mess!!!
You found 9:52 of highlights?
Yet again we have a generational team that doesn’t know how to play together
The highlights should of been 10 seconds, teams walking out, goal then the final whistle.
And no twice-finalist manager to blame.
How did Madueke  miss that !
This should be a video short not a highlight reel.
Tf they get 10 minutes out of this
No consistency in the lineups and Jordan Henderson? Really?......they are supposed to ptogress, no regress.
We need a better finisher. Take Pickford out and put Trafford in. Get rid of Henderson.
England used to thump teams like this 10 nil without hitting second gear
I gave my missus 9 better minutes last night 😅😅😅😅😅😅
Bet 365 were giving 1/1 on +4.5 goals 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅 wouldnt get it in a week 😅😅😅😅😅😅
mentioning how many shots on target england had was sad lol
And he selects grandad Henderson?  Tuchel is OUT OF HIS DEPTH. We were shocking.  Im bailing out with England.  Cautious, stale, boring.  Kane moves like a 40 year old now.  CRAP
Where is Messi?
Lol england fans are so miserable
Wtf was that staring lineup
They were told not to open Andorra’s box. So they didn’t try, clearly.
Can we get Southgate back asap
Should be sacked based on this game.
What’s the excuse now that foden isn’t in the team? Obviously people treat him as a scapegoat cause it’s easy
Just Embarrassing.
Overrated 🤡 they only scored 1 goal
Who needs Nytol when you've got England FC
I knew it was 1-0
harry kane is washed. replace him
Shoutout to the England fans. Class
o rușine de echipa -01 cu andorra 😂😂😂 de-aia nu va câștiga niciodată nimic
negativity helps no one but I get it. No excuses for that trash
Classic England performance. Struggling to minnows.
The media and fans are gonna give England loads of stick after today - just ACCEPT that Andorra's style of play did not allow you to score 4-5 goals and take the win. You don't get to win every game against lower opposition 4 or 5-0
Jammy
Dirty english woeful players
Stop making EXCUSES for England. They were Crap. Whenever Kane is on the pitch the team is DRAGED DOWN TO HIS LOW LEVEL.
awful match, I don’t care what anyone says a win is a win but these boys need to be more passionate and be glad they are actually playing for England. We need the passionate players like Saka to be implemented back into the squad.
What an embarrassment England were  one word LAZY new manager same effort England r a joke how do these lazy players get paid so much so overrated
Most expensive team in the world 😂😂😂😂😂
Has Jordan Henderson even got a club?  Plus isn't it time the big countries in terms of football have automatic qualification?  Waste of time and money all these ridiculous matches.
Henderson? Why? Tuchel has got to go, the guy doesn't give a 💩if we qualify or not 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
I was there, worse ever, fabulously bored.
Wow they found 9 minutes of highlights.
This team needed Wharton.
A win is a win idc
i lost respect for our team when they bent the knee
Madueke ain’t England quality
England the best.
Henderson. Enough said.
Shame
Surprised you managed to find 10 minutes worth of highlights. This game was 90 minutes I will never get back
10 minute highlight !! How did you guys pull that off 😅😅😅😅
I actually fell asleep watching this game that's the truth  It was an incredible game 🤣 Inspirational  Bellingham got taken of Englands best midfielder 😂  Spain Portugal 9 goals
Well done England! A wins a win!. Take no notice of negative England fans👍
Everyone saying england are a disaster, i didnt see the whole game but it looks like they made chances, but the ball just wouldnt go over the line
NONI FOR ENGLAND 🙏🏾🙌🏾
Ok i never thought i would ever witness a game worse than Man Utd v Spurs i think i just have .
PPPFFFFFFFFTTTTTTTT.😂  it's just soooooo predictable. Flatter to deceive at the start, and totally flatter to deceive when it really counts. The question is: why do people even bother ? These people are worshipped, put on pedestals, paid fortunes the rest of us can only dream of, and yet, put them up against little more than a pub team, and.
England are just boring to watch. So bland, no seasoning.
Wait til England play a lroperproper team lol
Even the England girls can put on a better performance than these Southgate boys.  Win or lose.
COMN KANE
Weird team selection... James as LB?! Jones as RB?! If he wanted an inverted RB then why not play Trent there cos Jones looked uncomfortable in that position. Rogers, Palmer, Kane and Bellingham all wanting to play the 10 and getting in each other's way... baffling why Bowen was left at home, he's the type of winger needed for these types of games.
Was busy watching paint dry. Didn’t miss much
spain and france rr scoring 3+ gols against eachother while england cant score 2 against andorra yea we aint winning da world cup
England without Saka…
There are highlights? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
PATHETIC
Why are Andorra wearing scarves?
Hope its a tactic pretend were rubbish and bring home the WC
I'm absolutely certain after seeing England demolish Andorra, that England will win the World Cup next summer.
Southgate was doing a better job than we all thought
We are definatly going to win the World Cup absolutely no doubt about it.
so boring
Win is a win
Diversity is the problem. Viv Anderson started the avalanche if memory serves right.
This is what you get when players have to play 60 games per season with barely any rest..   More rest for players = better product
Had more fun at my grans funeral than watching this game
Another underwhelming performance from a bunch of overrated, overpaid snowflakes
Absolutely pathetic performance none of them deserve to wear a England shirt
What another pile of Gareth Southgate styled poo, stopped watching after 55 mins, better things to do than watch that.
Apart from not losing against Andorra, I want to hear Thomas Tuchel name one positive point to come out of this game. I’ll give him a month to answer.
Watching England is almost as exciting as watching paint dry.
To be fair, if you're playing against a poor, backwards team without any ideas or any creative flair, it's no surprise that you concede just the one goal.
The real test for Tuchel is when he is facing stronger opponents, England under Southgate couldn’t do it. Winning against weak teams means nothing if you can’t do it aginst the top teams
All these people in here absolutely SLATING england, are the same numpties screaming it's coming home when they were in those 2 euro finals. Beating these awful teams who put 11 men behind the ball is an absolutely awful experience that is true, but you can only beat what's in front of you and they won. Every game is totally different and the better teams will allow much more space for england to attack into. I also will say that this isn't the exact 11 who will play at the world cup so I'd suggest a little patience from all these idiots.
What a shower against the mighty Andorra. Shameful
mind you, world cup is just a year away smh
Gladly I didn't watch it.
I thought 9 minutes and 53 seconds was pushing it a bit for highlights from this match.
Everyone: "but..but..but..we need a world class manager" * Tuchel keeps picking Henderson and only wins 1-0 against Andorran farmers * 😂 🚜 🤦‍♂️😬
Its like watching man utd
Absolute dogwank !!
Not a chance in the world Cup......
How dare a British broadcasting service ask a foreign national about how they feel about the chants outlining a political view!  Sky sports out of touch!
Struggling against Andorra the Explorer
wot utter utter dross of a team england are.  FOOKIN disgraceful perfomance, could not be arsed to play.  shambles!
Really poor performance unfortunately. They will be lucky if they win bingo let alone a world cup. Managers come and go and usually get the blame but the issue has always been the players themselves. Too laid back, easy come, easy go.
crap!!
All the pundits & players will gaslight the fans saying it's 3 points, let's move on. That doesn't really cut it against the team ranked 173rd
"An avalanche of goals" 😂
England should drop the big strong players like Rice, Bellingham for a bit and try out playing a more technical midfielders like Gibbs White, Morgan Rogers and Palmer. Thet might be able to help England transition into attack quicker.
This was a massive win for England against one of the world's biggest teams Andorra ( ranked 173rd in the world ) .
What highlights ffs
This shows how foden was no where near the problem its still the same football
It’s not coming home again. In fact it’s never coming home. Ever.
Southgate would be getting pelters if he was in the hot seat with a performance like this
Horror
As long as the england team is a shining beacon of diversity, who cares if we ever win anything.
Let's all get angry over an absolutely meaningless game.
England should forget World Cup they’re not winning it
Same old England... I get a team with so many men behind the ball can be hard to score against but to scrape past a team like Andorra is embarrassing, The gulf in apparent class and quality and they can't score more than 1 goal is utter shambles.
What a boring game. How do England have such top class players but play such low level boring football.
ITV has some balls to call any part of this game a 'highlight'...  We were beyond abysmal.
Word of warning to the FA due to clubs signing average foreigners there will be no England national team in 5 - 10 years time
There are simply too many games. These guys just finished their seasons, a handful of them have another club tournemant shortly after this.
Jordan Henderson is starting for England in 2025. He shouldn’t be playing for England at all.
England ranked 4th in the FIFA listings, and Andorra is ranked 173 and we only win by one goal .. hopeless
Embarrassing
Pathetic.
9 mins 😂😂😂
Absolutely dreadful, and some of the excuses I’ve already seen are just as bad. I don’t care that the season has just finished, the players acted like they didn’t care.
💩
An unpassionate England team. Local pub team would have done a better job and been more exciting.
How did they get 9 minutes from this😂 also only cole palmer would wear an under armour and then role the sleeves up
Hanging on at the end against Andorra. 😂😂
Utterly diabolical.  this was like watching a champion boxer struggle to beat a 10 year old child.  In this case, a win is not a win. We have got a LONG way to go before we are world cup contenders. You could make the argument Tuchel is experimenting if you want to make excuses but *its Andorra!* even an *EXPERIMENTAL TEAM* should be beating them 3-0.  Oh and *DROP HENDERSON! I AM SICK OF SEEING HIS NAME IN THE LINUP!*
