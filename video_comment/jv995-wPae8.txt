Kwisha mimi😂😂😂😂mutuse weh...hapa ni noma
Given 3 minutes break mutuse haezi rudi
Mutuse went to Gumbaru adult education. Not a lawyer at all
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Mutuseeeeee🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Please  respect who elected you  ongoya✍️✍️✍️✍️✍️✍️
They could have suggested they introduce pass .
These honorable guys would have been better fighting to protect the children against caning in schools. Gachagua is a billionaire and the law is just making him look unwise. One cannot force himself on another person where a situation of mutual understarstanding cannot be arrived at.
Walimsalimia kwa matanga ya Mrs. Kalembe huko kwao. Next they will vote him out. Mutuse patia watu wako maji na ile pesa Ruto alikupatia!!!!!
Mutuse mpaka unaomba protection.proceed with ur Kamukunji photography papers.Kibwz umefanya nini
masters of law from uon........mover of motion.....
Anyone celebrating the unconstitutional and brutal removal and replacement of the DP should understand that this is not a matter personal to the Rigathi Gachagua.   It is the constitution of Kenya under attack.   It is about the elevation of Ruto above the constitution.   It is yet another step in the making of a dictator.  It is the making of another Moi or Idi Amin.  I hope the courts will arise and stop this madness.  I hope Kenyans will arise and say no.   What a sad day for Kenya!
Mutuse, imefsulu na maprojo zako.  Sasa wewe ambia ruto akupee deputy president.
Now I understand why proper lawyers (excluding Mutuse) earn a lot of money .
in the end,just who wasted whose time?!
Wish ningekuwa Mutuse huyu lawyer ningemuita keynoo  mara kumi😢😢😅😅
Afadhali hivo ckuzaliwa mjinga na kibelebele
This MP is unbelievable
This lawyer waah,smart kabisa maswali yamesoma,mutuse tusiwa utusike ,shame on you
U are lawyer u said😂😂😂,I came in peace
This lawyer aki
Huyu mluhya amekula  law ama    ni law imemkula?😂😂😂
Lipeni tu kile mmekula mkijua sisi si wajinga tunawaelewa vizuri sana tena sana
Ama shida ni kizungu nikama hakuelewa hiyo kizungu wangemuuliza kwa kikamba
Did Mp Mutuse family watch this...🫢
Kimeumana😃Mutuse utakiona😮😅😅😅😅
Mutuse is such a waste of time, Wakamba sasa tuwache malice na kutumiwa because hatuwezi endelea kuishi kutumiwa kila mahali, after Wahindi sasa tunatumiwa kuji aibisha mpaka Parliament kusema tu ukweli.
At least we have Senate that is independent and working...
Kusema ukweli hata kama ni wewe mutuse...ungemanage?
From 1960s Africa has never realized the colonizer just took a break he will come back. In 70 years  we don't have anything that can stop him when he comes back. Politics is the least of our concern. System of government belongs to the colonizer, Machines belongs to the colonizer, religion belongs to the colonizer, education belongs to the colonizer, healthcare belongs to the colonizer, weapons belongs to the colonizer, food security belongs to the colonizer, mode of transport belongs to the colonizer,  clothes belongs to the colonizer, language belongs to the colonizer. We are a big joke. We have pretty done nothing in 70 years. We can spend 2 months to impeach a vice president but we cant spend time to develop our own engines, weapons, food technologies, our own system of government that works. etc. Africa this is a wakeup call.
Wueeeh 😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂mutuse
Humiliation kkk
Are you with us Mr witness,,,  Yes,I'm with us😂😂
😂
❤ñn😌❤️
The confused Mutuse na anavaa suti ati anaenda ku impeach DP Gachagwa.🤣🤣🤣 Gachagwa haendi popote.
Presssure increases
Mutuse angepewa nafasi anaezatuanga huyu lawyer baya sana😊
This DPs lawyer alisoma walai
This council 4 sure is fire,,i like him
That was a mental game ,the lawyer know what he is saying are lies but just tries to play around with Mwengi's mind.He should have noted that by the time the chair was being requested for him to take a sit.🤣
This lawyer has made mutual to look like primary pupil
Mutuse enda choo uende ukiendanga
Kambas are cowards. They surrendered the maumau war and joined the colonialists to toment kikuyus. They thrives in back biting
Kenya ni home kweli
Weweeh ok

Nawaambia kino sitaki
Different Between lawyer and advocate

Not respecting
Sema kimeumana
Mutuse you terribly ruined your career,no one will dare to hire you and your company.you're such mess.
Surely Elisha Ongoya 😮
Mutuse:"The law says that you raise.....there's no law" Ongoya:"Thank you very much we proceed to the next..."
Wachanganyikiwe na wachanganywe wote kwa jina la yesu mwenye nguvu na mamlaka

I will never seek legal advice from Mutuse vile atakutupa kwa mtaro
Mutuse answer 'KINO' to every question to confuse them also
Nikiwa Mutuse nakohoa mpaka nianguke hadi proceedings zisimamame niende nijipange kwanza nirudi nkijua what to expect
Uyu mutuse amehongwa tu adanganye.
Senate is the house of justice no propaganda there
Some lawyers excel in the art of confusing witnesses. This is the case here leaving Mutuse who is also a lawyer confused with no idea on what to answer
😂😂 mutuse alipita form four na A- sasa izi n nn anasema
The National Assembly is a problem

There's what we call and rumours......Mutuse was paid to present a motion based on innuendos, rumors, lies and hate for the Gachagua...
😂😂
Huyu mkamba ni mjinga sana anapeleka a motion of impeachment kwa mbunge na kwake hakuna kitu amefamya mbuzi wwe

The lawyer is ok
Riggy G team wamejipanga kabisa.
If you know the law, the lawyer is just gimmick
huyu lawyer anafaa kuuliza ruto maswali .
Gachagua has the best lawyers led by lawyer above lawyers YAHWEH
Gachagua has the best lawyers led by lawyer above lawyers YAHWEH
The lawyer for the deputy president is overly verbose. If you're keen, he lacks intelligence. Mutuse is remaining calm not to fall into his trap of trying to gag him into finding the answers he needs
Ningekuwa mutuse ama matusi. Ningetoroka
Mutuse alikuwa anajua  mambo  itakuwa   simple  kama  uko kwa bunge na MPs 😅😅😅😅
"Its a prank Mr. Speaker." 🧐Mutuse
Senate is pur supreme court that's the keyna we wants. Mutual was just picked and paid to do the job but he is 😱  tobdeath.!!
Pesa ya ruto rudisha pesa ya ruto 😅😅😅
Walai kenya sihami 😂😂😅
The power of the tongue 😮😮
Mungu akiingilia kila kitu inasimama
This is not a good lawyer, Lawyer brush ideas not shoulders, this guy is a dictator, he won't survive for long the likes of Gachagua
Mutuse ameshindwa kujitetea
I think this mp is drunk
This is alawyer
Senate is our supreme law after DP wins
Jamaa alicram paper 3 na ikakuja emergency 😂😂 wueeh 🤣
It was a prank😂it was a prank😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃
Time manage economically 😂😂😂
Kanyanyaga shingo bado anapumua
This is like diddys shitty deals....
Weeh this lawyers manze are smart
I think we should change the senate to judiciary for fairness in our country that is full of corruption cases🙏
The lawyer is very smart.
Hii ndio madhara ya kukula hongo ya Ruto,huwezi ukatetea  your own motion, unakaa kuku imenyeshewa. It's evidently correct that hii case you DP ni siasa za chuki na unafiki.
Is mutise a lawyer?
I salute the lawyer asking the questions ❤❤❤❤
wow gachagua amejipanga kweli
Those tackle's are career ending😅😅😅
Substitute please 🙏
