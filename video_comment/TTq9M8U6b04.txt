In fact, Macky Sall himself triggered all the issues. He plotted with the PDS. Macky Sall himself was a member of PDS. PDS candidate, currently in Qatar after being jailed and exiled by Macky Sall, accused the Constitutional Concil of corruption after his bet was rejected for his french citizenship. Macky Sall instructed the MPs of his party to join the PDS to vote a law to investigate the supposed bribery of members of the CC. And guess who they say bribed the C.C? The candidate that Macky Sall himself chose for his party!!!! Macky Sall's goal is to extend his presidency, take time to juge and disqualify the popular candidate chosen by Sonko party (he is currently unfairly in prison too), bring back PDS's candidate to split the opposition forces and finally change his own unpopular candidate. All that, because he senses that Sonko's side would win the election if held now and make him pay for his crimes
Senegal must quickly join the "Alliance of Sahel States" which is the precursor of the "Federated States of Africa." Remember Cheikh Anta Diop's prescient 1984 outline "Black Africa - The Economic and Cultural Basis for a Federated State."
From an Irish American in NYC, respect to my fellow freedom and democracy loving people in Senegal. This is heartbreaking to see, because I know that Senegal is considered Africa’s most stable democracies. This the first time an election has been postponed there. Democracy is backsliding all over the world, including in my own country, with the Jan 6th insurrectionists attacking our US Capital Building, trying to overthrow our democracy after our last presidential election.     Authoritarianism is on the rise and it must be stamped out! But a word of warning, the dangerous part of your election being postponed is not so much in the postponement itself, it’s the conspiracies born from it. It's the conspiracies about rigged elections and all that kind of stuff, so by the time you do have your election, nobody has faith in the democratic process. Nation’s plunge into civil war very easily after elections when everyone who’s candidate loses feels the election was stolen. So be mindful of that, because part of being pro democracy is accepting the results of an election when your candidates loses too.     My best to the Senegalese People. I hope your elections become scheduled soon.
I have a word to say but my heart is broken out country don't deserve this kind of person.he is a criminal
This people just want maky sall out...
