What's our next project??????
Did nobody notice the fly on the left eyelid of the head at 12:51?  You can even see the fly moving away from the left side of the head in the air at 13:02.  LOL.
Adam Savage has such a wholesome laugh 😂
It is for birthing cows? At first I thought it was for conceiving ones..
Well it happened once at classic f1 - the Alan Stacey died because of it-.
It's funny because the other day in Germany a 29yo woman was hit to the head from a duck while walking and needed stitches, while the duck died from the impact.
God dangit YT don´t recommend me a video that i´ve seen :( I thought we had a new vid with Adam again, so sad!
No matter how old I get. I will always wanna be Adam Savage when I grow up.
It's funny. I vividly remember all the way back to Mythbusters when Adam and Jamie were testing the slipperiness of banana peels when you step on them, and when they were trying to find something even more slippery, Jamie holds up a white cup and says "Well, I just so happen to have this animal birthing agent lying around," to which Adam was largely disgusted by it.  Seeing him wholeheartedly use this to shoot a ballistics gel goose into Fabio's face is something I was not expecting for 2025, but here we are XD
Bunch of giggling girls
I’m glad the real Fabio didn’t lose any eyeballs. That would be horrific.
Am I the only one who now wants to see Gav and Dan in Kentucky filming Scott firing a ballistic gel goose out of his punt gun at a zombie head?
Fabio's cartoon eyes was hilarious.
That thumbnail though.
12:27 that is the fastest hair loss I've seen.
That. Was excellent. 😊
7:42 is definitely the greatest advert for j-lube
Not a supersonic goose?  Why not?  Can we see a supersonic goose?
"SOMEONE IS GONNA LOSE AN EYE!!!", my Mother yelled at us as we fired a greased up goose out of our potato cannon.
Fabio thought, he would get his hair geled. That's why he looked so happy.
Yeah, that thumbnail shot does NOT look like a bird...
would like to point out that a real goose has a stiff internal structure and is tipped with a hard beak, so the damage on fabio was probably worse.
The thumbnail looks like something else I would see in a drawer
Oh no Adam Savage and Lube.
If only it had been covered in feathers 😂😂😂🤘🏻😜. Well done though!
Your lubed bird does look like a large sex toy. Peace all and stay safe.
There are collaborated videos now?
anything that involves Adam Savage and Lube has my mark of approval.
12:28 Suddenly, Jeff Bezos!
I adore that Adam’s opening moments in the content of this video are showing his consummate professionalism when handling the air cannon. 1:53 It makes me respect him more than I already did! He’s so interested in doing this and it’s obvious, but he’s also deeply invested in the group’s safety, which is so respectable.
It's really cool to see how different a collaboration is when there is no network tv budget to fix everyone's attitude..........
Looks like a danny carey mask
wouldnt the tube being like 10  or 15 feet make it shoot out much faster? 20 ft seems like its probably lingering in there too long/ the pressure dissipates too early
5:30 blatant breaking of the golden rule: Never do math in front of a camera
Watching Adam laugh at things that'd upset me is why Adam is a success
Just got a whole new meaning to the word “give him the bird🖕🏻”
As a chemist who has had to live through countless safety seminars about Things Going Wrong, I LOVE that you keep in the safety stuff.
The Fabio head looks kind of like Brent from Goobertown Hobbies.
I had a bird hit me in the face once. Thankfully not a goose.
12:53 Birds-eye
12:50 watch that fly get absolutely obliterated in slow mo near Fabio's eye lol
Should have had the real Fabio there just for laughs
They know what they did
There is slow motion, and then there is wasting my life waiting for a payoff.  This is the latter.
Fabio needs hard teeth
15:23  For a second, I thought Adam was rinsing his shoes off in the lube.  😂
that did most certainly not look like a bird in the thumbnail
Adam.......relax dude.
Just realized does Gav have a F*ckface shirt lol
that's a goose???? thought it was a lubed up adult toy lol
Absolute Legends on this Vid.
Wtf I’m watching 🤦🏼‍♀️😅
*MEATY THWACK*
PLEASE! PLEASE someone tell me they saw weird al getting slapped in the face, for a SPLIT second ... just search weird al yankovic its literally him smiling like the pic, and i know my sugar might be a little low... but i was cackling inside thinking they did him dirty with the thumbnail looking like something you'd find in you're mot... yeah...
Bobby looks like Brandon Herrera
That target face is horrifying to behold.
bird up
Adam Savage is definitely the man to consult when it comes to firing birds at things with big air cannons
10:14 this Fabio head looks like a blond Weird Al.
8:31 to skip filler
8:55 fatality!
Those damn birds look so much like slugs.
They knew what they were doing with that thumbnail lol
I cannot give then enough credit for showing the safety talk. It shows the respect they have for how dangerous a scratch built device like this could be if it goes wrong, and how very real that possibility is. Even though several of them, and especially Adam, have more experience with stuff like this than potentially anyone else on the planet, they still have a healthy respect for their own ability to be completely wrong. Even hearing Adam in the background announcing "range is clear" later is great.
I miss Mythbusters...
Wipe that smile off your face Fabio !!!
Video about something that happened to Fabio. People mentioned section: Mel Gibson, Michael Jackson, Adam Savage
i didnt think i was gonna see adam savage lube up a bird when i clicked on the video
11:15 turned Fabio into Nicohlas Cage 🤣
Fabio took one for the team...or two, or three, or ... DAMN, what a hero he is. And he just kept on smiling. 🤣
Recreate the USS dynamite with scale models. And bring Drachinifel.
I gotta get my head out the gutter…
It’s so weird how people think Seagal was slammed when there were witnesses, notably the stunt coordinator there and another person, who confirmed that never happened. It’s weird how nobody questions Gene Labells story when it isn’t corroborated by anyone else. He also tried pushing this narrrive regarding Bruce Lee on the set of the green hornet. Again, it never happened as confirmed by multiple cast and staff members like benny dobbins the stunts coordinator who were present that day.
We do agree on the silicon projectile on the thumbnail looking like a thick third leg of a bipedal being, right?... right, guys?
P Diddy would probably recommend using baby oil 😅
when i saw that thumbnail, i did not think that was a fake bird.
You guys had to know what that preview image looks like
One of the best constructed Fabio heads I have ever seen.
Utter pointless silliness. Well done. In reality, Fabio was lucky. A beak to the eye could have done serious permanent damage.
Hmmmm thats a very phallic "bird".
Reminds me of Lew Zealand’s fish.
skip to 8:20
Diddy could've saved a lot of money.. 3:10
it's never a good sign when you can look into your own ear XD
> "you may be thinking to yourself why is a ballistic gel Goose covered in animal birthing Lube being fired out of a 20ft air cannon"  nobody was thinking about no goose.
I took a 35 mph bird to the knee and it really hurts 😂
Fabio's never gonna live down that goose. Just pure dumb luck, but people will always say "Hey, remember that time Fabio killed a goose face on a roller coaster?" It's probably his best known part. Romance novel covers, niche market, Exorcist 3, most people just know the first, that guy that took a goose to the face, instant recognition.
Very good thumbnail and first few seconds of the video! 💙
More volume = more speed.  Try not using the 1" npt tank port and valve and go with the other side of the tank ,2" npt and a fast acting electric valve to launch the greasy quacker.
Every time I'm suggested this I keep thinking this is a dummy of Weird Al.
0:14 not the question I was gonna ask, because that wasn't what I saw XD
😂😂😂
You had me at "animal birthing lube"
I am so thankful that Adam still enjoys this kind of stuff.
So, how bad would this hurt? End of life?
that bird is definitely much heavier than a normal bird
Its like a Tom and Jerry cartoon.
itd be funny if you did the same thing again but with a taxidermy goose
From 1:49 to 2:38 feels like a glimpse into what producing Mythbusters must have been like, it felt like Adam going over some of the many safety checks he developed on the show for doing exactly this type of experimentation.
The glazing in the comments for this bobbyfingers guy is crazy, I saw one comment saying he has the best channel on yt. Yeah right
You may find yourself, firing a lubed ballistic duck out of an air cannon And you may ask yourself, "Well, how did Fabio's head get here?"
Is is just me, or is Fabio a spitting image of Weird Al?
if thats a goose then I have something weird stuck in my ass.
Them: "Bird to the face"  Thumbnail: 🍆
That is a creepy-looking dummy.
What on earth are those trousers that Mr. Fingers is wearing??! They're glorious!
Why is it so funny watching a rubber goose leave the end of a Canon in slow mo???😂
Overlay woody woodpeckers laugh as rubber duck exits the Canon in slow mo!!!😂
Look at Felipe Massa in Hungary 2009, when a 2lb spring came off Jenson Button's BrawnGP car and struck him on the helmet at 150mph, knocking him out and causing significant trauma.
nobody see the fly get squished at 12:51? (gf noticed)
the opening monolog was crazy
It doesn’t look like a bird.  🍆
6:12 🍆joke
"Nailed it on the first try"  Huh, he really did do Dan's normal job
Looks more like weird Al that Fabio.
pretty cool
Bring Mythbusters back but on this channel. Maybe change the name if there is no Jamie. 😢
watched this blazed af, totally recommend
witout hair it's just bezos
Yo nice shirt!  I live there!
感㤙分享！ 謝謝！
"It's not going... it's not a supersonic goose" - only on this channel is that a realistic statement to make, I love it
I know Trevor Lawrence has been a bust for the jags but he didn’t deserve all that
My god. Adam Savage, Slow Mo Guys, AND BobbyFingers? Maybe this world is worth it after all...
Out riding a motorcycle one day.  I hit a crow at about 40MPH.  I had a full face helmet with the visor up and sunglasses on. My nose was sore for 3 days.
Why are you doing this to a Weird Al model?
Petition to have Adam join permanently, or to combine Slow Mo Guys and Tested, please!
ooh, I wish I could say it's easy to get inside me, but I really want to be that goose right now. And I want to receive that goose up me arse.
15:01 couldn't stop watching this
14:34 when she makes your honkwhistle toot after cradling the conkers
Хернёй занимаются - а живут в достатке, счастливые люди.
""Bird""
Adam and the slo mo guys bring back the myth busters life is grand
Ya'll sound kinda Fairy to me.
As soon as the wig flew off I saw Jeff Bezos instantly ☠️ which, of course, made the subsequent shots to his face all the more satisfying to watch (:
I heard Bobby Fingered Dan when he beat him up
If a bird hits your face you will get instantly BALD.
fill thetube with lube lol
The pure joy Adam has no matter what he’s doing is pretty awesome.
I love Adams laugh
One of the greatest colabs!
This is more interesting than my major subjects
My dumb mind thought it was a d!L(|o
I love the waving Fabio hair
Asking why they are firing ballistic gel shaped into a goose out of a barrel is the exact reason why I am here
ive been dying to a frame on 14:35 its HILARIOUS! XD
Danm, blark really must have a massive headache after that.
tube lube? no. animal birthing agent? yes!
WEIRD AL NOOOOOOOOOOO
Love Mythbusters sad they stopped
I knew nothing, precisely nothing about Fabio before watching Fix: The Ministry Movie, a documentary of industrial metal band Ministry's hideously unpleasant 1996 "Sphinctour" tour... amongst all the band and crew struggling with severe drug addiction and a host of emotional issues while on tour, Fabio turns up (out one of Ministry knows him, Uncle Al Jourgensen seems to know a great many people). I had no idea who he was, just this super buff Italian sounding dude with long hair shows up, and everyone's like "Oh, Fabio's here?!". Such an obscure place to see this character I know nothing about, surrounded by a band who are in the process of living the best and worst of the "Rock And Roll" lifestyle, attracting celebrities, stalkers, death threats... people are having overdoses off camera, someone tear-gassed the the venue mid song (culminating in Uncle Al taking to the stage wearing a bullet proof vest, carrying a 6D cell Maglite). I still know virtually nothing about Fabio, but seeing his uncanny-valley level visage in front of a cannon that fires simulacrum dead geese is... pretty badass.
Put a vacuum actuated piston in there so all the air leaves the tank instantaneously and the projectile is able to use the whole length of the barrel to speed up. With air cannons you need to at minimum match the volume of the tank to the barrel but the higher ratio tank:barrel with the piston, the more the potential the projectile has to accelerate. I found that using a standard ball valve, the slight leak after initially breaking the valve causes a slight loss in cannon power. With the losses becoming greater the longer the valve took to open.   Beautiful video mate, hopefully my ramblings can give an idea or help inspire someone to try and build something better. Watching Mythbusters when I was little got me into engineering, made me fall in love with the scientific method.
It’s so surpassingly stupid and I wouldn’t change a thing ❤
But where's the footage from Bobby and Dan's fake fight?
I been watching slo mo guys since the classic dan jumping on, going thru, or even being inside a giant water balloon days. I am so HERE for the collab era. This is epic!
Does this hurt the birds?
nice to see adam savage shove a wet goey object in a tight hole 👍
"Honking big" 😆😆😆
10:09 it looks like weird al dressed as Fabio
Adam’s energy is amazing!
3:39 something about hearing Adam Savage yell “LUBE SHOT”
I know how Fabio feels. Driving OTR at 75mph on i-15 south of Boise ID I got hit by owl to windshield infront of me have video on my Channel from 2016 I think it was
i thought it was something else in the thumbnail😭
They shoulda used a butt!  Go for the bullseye!
Don't let diddy know about that lube 😅
just realized ive watched mythbusters so much as a kid, even seen the guy in real life, ive never actually seen adam without the glasses
there's a poetic dichotomy between Adam Savage's fervent exuberance, and Bobby Fingers' wry Irish languid nonchalance that would make a great double act
the dummy looks like weird al Yanukovych.
Adem savgie
That 1" pipe connecting the tank to the barrel, is killing the potential power you could get out of that cannon.
OHHHH thats gose i thought its somethink diffrent
Why not in normal speed as well?
I know Gustavo from @stinkydragonpod
Ohhh, I am soo sorry for you, Hercules!
Looks like Weird Al Yankovich in the thumbnail 😮
Enjoy looking over your shoulder for Fabio wanting a word😂
Just guys being dudes.
It's crazy that I saw the title and thumbnail and immediately thought Fabio rollercoaster accident 😂
boring af
All these legends come together to recreate one of the best stories from 20th Century Virginia.
Is that Jeff Bezos?
that does NOT look like a goose
It's getting to the point where a guy can't just launch a bird from a cannon anymore...
Amazing video, slowmo guys + Adam + Bobby is one of the best matchups ever, also Bobby wearing an Adebisi shirt is such a throwback, haven't watched Oz in ages
no slo mo footage of the carpark brawl tho? 😂
I have her i have her hahah😂
😂
That whole video made me smile so much!
I enjoyed this, but can someone please tell me why Fabio and the goose is still famous?
The transferport between airtank and tube is somewhat tiny.
That’s a real eye popper.
The head looks like a character that Sharlto Copley would play in a movie.
14:35 = the Bends - Radiohead
I knew bobby fingers was cool, and then i saw his adebisi shirt and he was even cooler!!💪💪🤘🤘 Edit: also, everytime he pops up i just imagine blue ruin!!
I'm SOOOOOOO HAPPY to see big names give Bobby Fingers a shout out. The guy is a GD genius on top of being incredibly creative and hilarious beyond belief.
The goofy smile is what makes the video!
who else is here from Bobby's video, wondering what started the handbag fight in Austin ?
12:50 pay atention to the dummy's left eye. a fly sets on it and get's bombed so hard. talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time
Is there a medical issue causing Adam to constantly wipe his mouth?
Efficacy of lube - Confirmed.
As a motorcycle rider, I see this as lesson for others to put on helmet as bird or other junk on the road would do to your head at highway speeds.
Adam Savage is a national treasure.
I love how my favourite person on TV was Adam Savage and my two favourite people on youtube are Simone Giertz and Gavin Free and Adam has now worked with both of them ! It truly makes me very happy <3
looked like Joe Walsh on some of those hits.
I can't tell you how nice and comfy it feels to see Adam behind a camera and giggling at the dumbest of things in the field again.
On the prewiew it looks a little different, like...
I had to look it up, but DAYUMM! The dude really got hurt when that goose hit him in the face.
More people need to watch Bobby Fingers
Fabio
Adam Savage is such a legend.
Bwahahah 😂!!   I was there two days after that happened! Visited BG on 4/1/99, it was all everyone was talking about!
I remember Fabio taking it in the face on that coster.
It was bad enough when I got hit by a pigeon while riding my motorbike at 40 mph it nearly nocked  me off the back of the bike and gave me whiplash. god knows what would have happened if I had been going at 70mph
The head looks like blark from blark and son😂
Sorry… I look at that thumbnail for the video and I don’t see Fabio. It looks more like Weird Al Yankovic.
If you didn't watch Mythbusters growing up you didn't live
Weird looking bird
They moment they talked about I like to call life’s side missions.
Ngl that didn’t look like a goose
that didnt look like a bird
Thumbnail looks like Weird Al getting hit in the face with a phalic object
That’s not a bird…
I'm curious why they didn't make a 1 ft or like a certain amount of centimeters mark on the barrel to help them calculate the speed a little bit easier lol
oh i thought it was a rubber dingaling
One of my favorite collabs recently!!!! Excellent job to all of you, and Bobby had some hilarious deadpan humor
14:33  WOW 😭
Bro, the facial expressions that thing seemed to make then the shot of the eyeballs popping out had me GEEKED! My gf thought I was insane till I showed her 😂😂😂😂 now we both are geeked😂😂😂
when the eye pops out theres a fly or something on the eyelid and then it gets hit with the lubby goose lol
I’m sure Fabio would love this
00:01 looks so dirty
This video has me feeling nostalgic.
I had this happen while riding motorcycle. It was a killdeer "allegedly" @ 140 hitting me square in the top of my helmet. Thankfully it glanced off just above my face shield.
Working with Adam Savage on something like this would be a dream come true for many of us here, I'm sure.
tbh, i thought you where using bad dragon toys....
Adam Savage is so freakin annoying.  I barely got through this.
“ You may be thinking to yourself where the hell is Dan “
cant believe you guys got Jeff Bezos in one of your vids. You're going places. 12:28
Humble Dan thinking he's just "alright" at some things. Bro, have you seen yourself with a gun? You have amazing skills!
Wait a minute, is that Gavin from achievement hunters?
That thumbnail doesn't look like a bird
The thumbnail looks like Weird Al realizing he made a mistake
The production style difference when you see Adam in something is obvious because Adam is so genuine. LoL he becomes a static variable. 😂
Remember fellas always keep your bird lubed
@13:04  Joe Walsh living life in the fast lane right there😂
I mean, you _SAY_ "silicone Fabio," but we all know the truth. That's just strawberry-blond Weird Al.
Fabio and his creepy agent followed my girlfriend (a model for Dolce & Gabbana; and Roberto Cavalli) and I back home from Caffe Roma in Beverly Hills late one night. I asked him what he thought was going to happen (ew), and he didn't have much in the way of a coherent answer. Point is, I really wish I had a ballistic gel goose cannon at the time. I would have used it.
12:31 its nice to see Jeff Bezos put himself to use doing something good for a change.
A tablespoon of J lube will suffice to make a gallon of liquid lube. As a giant bubble  maker I can attest you do not need most of a bottle in a five gallon bucket, one quarter cup would almost be overkill. The more you know ...
2 questions: wheres Destin, and what would a supersonic bird do to the face?
I love how adam savage just gets to hang out with all the kids he inspired grown up
I've used that slurry to help sows give birth, and it is impossible to get off of your arms!
a bit funny but its just not a bird. beak missing and all that.
Fellow Irish man ti's good to see💯
How many times was needed. To think someone’s face went through that
I can’t be the only one who’s mind went to naughty places lol
Bird? ........ 🤣
This normal Canadian stuff. Often having too dodge Geese sailing at horrendous speeds.
I haven't laughed so hard in ages!! 😂😂😅
adam savage be doin side quests
Ayoooo
thou shall not use God's name in vain interesting how they won't curse on TV or if they do they bleep it out  but they are able to curse God's name our creator  our savior  those who reject and curse Jesus Christ will live eternity in hell  good news is you still have time to repent and turn to the greatest history book ever written the holy Bible King James version  great to see Adam still doing things like mythbusters the top science show I've ever watched
I cannot stop watching this trilogy of videos
What a perfect combination of YouTube entertainers/educators!
"Am I missing an eyeball?"
things i didn't expect to hear tonight; a mythbuster yelling "LUBE SHOT in 3... 2... 1!!"
I thought it was my grandma's toy yougot💀💀
Ohh..  Fabio.. I guess it was real.  👄
I thought you meant the model that went to Busch Gardens and got his nose broke from a bird while ridding a coaster.. or that's what they said anyway, might just been old school clickbait
I could smell the smoke with all that math going on 😂
Mrs. Savage: So honey, what did you do today? Adam: I shot geese out of a canon at Fabio's face
Funniest thing about this is the actual coaster that Fabio got hit on goes 73 mph which is the same speed that the gun fires so this is actual scientific representation
As someone who lives 5 minutes from Busch gardens (the place where Fabio got hit on apolos chariot) that ride is no joke and I myself have almost gotten hit by a bird on it
Poor Danny Carey
The face at 14:35 🤣
Adam Savage is the crossover we all needed
That thumbnail doesn’t look like a bird 😅
sounds like tom scott is in the background
Well done boys. I can imagine the surrealism of the situation, especially as fanboys of MB.
What stupidity!!!!
No frozen projectile
12:28 wait is that jeff bezos?
y u dun dis 2 weird al?
Did you consider adding rifling to your duck?
5:38 now THIS is what I live for. Just watching a bunch of specialists in the zone, doing their thing and practically being able to hear the gear turning in their heads.
Does this guy know how lucky he is to get Adam savage AND the slo mo guys?
12:31 Jeff bezos that you? 😂
13:33 - Putin !
Sloppy joes shirt is killing it.
the single teardrop on the mannequins face after he got hit at 11:18 xD
9:28 Dude shoving a lubed up bird into a pipe, while wearing a Simon Adebisi shirt. 😂
Just be honest. All of that came from Diddy's house.
i dont know why or how but why does the bobby guy sound and look like like nogla
I have taken a magpie to the chest at over 200km/h. It bloody hurts.
All fun and games until someone loses an eye 🧐 Then it's just a game " Find the Eye"! 😆😅🤣😂👍
I loved mithbusters.
Bobby's diarama channel is SO AMAZING lol, I love his stuff
10:20 F=ma
Jealous as hell. Completely admit it. I just wish I was smart enough to spend a day with Adam Savage just building.
That thumbnail is WILD 😂😂
I'm not seeing any comments about 5:24-6:08 so here you go.
Is that lazlo from Gta?
at 12:25 the distortion in the face makes the fabio head look exactly like nicolas cage
now that's a collab I wanted to see, good stuff! there are some absolutely peach screenshots of fabio post-impact
Next collab idea: Go to the Hacksmith headquarters and film their most popular or interesting projects over the years in super slow mo
Dont let diddy see the lube
14:34
The most boring video of you guys.... Those interactions of YouTubers looks like when a show is having little view and make an crossover with another show to try to increase the views. Smells like desperation
So glad it’s a goose and not what it looks like in the thumbnail lol
6:16 - 9:03 That scene was shot after all the other ones since the face has damage that is not on any of the following shots. Why do you put the scenes out of sequence, do you have a pulp fiction syndrome?
Is it me or does that actually look like a slug?
*adam savage:* holds silicone phallic object, lubes it up and tries to force it into a hole. *viewers:* wtf??? *adam savage:* its supposed to look like a bird... *viewers:* suuuure... we believe you ;)
That would mess you up, wow lol😅
Sponsored by Bad Dragon.
Nice to see how all this technology is being applied to worthwhile endeavors
@12:30 went from Disney Prince to Jeff Bezos real quick 😅
I want to see Fabios reaction to watching this video.
without the wig the head looks more like a jeff bezos
6:11 that's what she said
‘How did you lose your eye?’  ‘An oily bird.’  ‘What?’
I love the projects people come together on because they love the science and art of something so strange. a smile on every face in this video
That’s didn’t look like a bird in the thumbnail.
Every time i see adam doing projects or science i automatically think it's myth busters 🤷🏼‍♂️🤣
that's peak men behaviour right here.
Use a real bird, come on :(
I've imagined Hell to have less creepy things than the Fabio head.
"I'm startin to tink that Fabio was tellin the trooth! " Hilarious!!!
I got hit in the face with a live flying turkey while riding my motorcycle in North Carolina at about 40 mph. My brother was riding behind me and saw it explode in a cloud of feathers. I was okay but my neck hurt for a few days. Had feathers inside my helmet and wedged around the face shield and stuff. We couldn't find the turkey afterwards.
15:22 if somebody had swapped the lube for the water bucket 🤣🤣🤣
i misunderstood the title.
This is almost unwatchable 😞
now try it with someone bending over on the other end
Tbh that doesn’t look like a goose
“Bird”  Sure, Jan ☠️💀☠️☠️
For everything the man knows, Adam still doesn't know the difference between a cow and a calf.
Why does the thumbnail look like wierd al
riding my Fat Boy at 35 MPH. A butterfly came out of the woods and hit my cheek. I felt like I got hit with a rock, it was so surprising I couldn't stop laughing. A goose, well probably would have died there and then even at 35 MPH
swear to god......... the slo-mo guys are living every.... frikkin'.... nerd's..... DREAM. You MF's made a god damn video with Adam Savage! FFS that man is LEGEND.
My brother caught a buzzard to the chest at about 65 mph about 30 years ago, he still talks about it. I guess it was pretty bad...lol
It's crazy how much joy I got from watching this
Its looks like a bad dragon toy
Gus looks great
The eye popping out was so unsettling. 😅
I love seeing Adam Savage being professional
12:50 that fly was in the wrong place at the wrong time. RIP fly.
Should've had Griffin Mcelroy there. "I wanna talk about bird lube, NOW."
14:34 😂
So super sonic goose is next?
My wife was working at Busch Gardens in Williamsburg when that happened with Fabio.
I can't be the only one that didn't think that looked like a bird in the thumbnail. The lube dripping off while he was stuffing it into the cannon made it worse...
4:43 when i saw the chucklehead with the phone, all the air went out of my viewing experience.
Pause the video at 10:00 and mute it. Then open Vangelis - Charriots of Fire on another tab and press play on this video.
10:33 "We've forgotten the crackers!"
Laughed for a solid 5 mins after I saw the shot at 14:34 through like 14:37
I am sorry to bother you.  Just had to drop by and let you know that the thumbnail is, somehow, very similar to Weird Al Yankovic. I dont know why, it just is.  Until we meet again!
these clowns dont deserve Adam.
SLOPPY JOE'S SHIRT SPOTTED WE LOVE YOU GAVIN
14:34
good preview, lol
oh its a goose i thought it was a ...
😅
i though it is face of Wierd Al
That’s exactly why I wear a full helmet on my motorcycle, for example I was going upwards of 70mph and a 3 inch moth just splattered all over my face, if I didn’t have my face covered it would have smashed into my teeth. Imagine telling someone you lost teeth because of a moth
Fabio is going to keep an eye out for you, you silly goose!
Amazing video!!!
Supersonic goose.
Bird? Yeah, sure, lets call it that
Speaking from a wildlife biology and ornithology background technically the gooses neck shouls be rigid out not floppy, the rigidness would.help alot with aerodynamics
im sorry but the projectile looks VERY MUCH like a male appendage.
Having Adam Savage in the video is one thing. Watching him have a blast like he was in an old Mythbusters video is "next level"! ❤️❤️👍👍🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You have an eye for details there , my friends.  Thanks for a hilarious video.
should read what fabio says about this incident, the goose didnt hit him in the face
I once saw a pigeon get hit by an intercity  train  and end up as a puff of feathers and red.  It was mostly in one piece minus its feathers. That thing would hurt to the face.
Adams safety brief 🤦‍♂️ that American way of speaking to people who regularly do dangerous stuff like their 5yr olds .
Noice.
he looks like "Brice de Nice" (Jean Dujardin)
Bro, that doesn’t look like a bird in the thumbnail 💀
kinda wish you put a proper beak on the goose. IRL a beak would do serious tissue damage at those speeds. still wild to see and very entertaining!
😂😂😂 oh Jesus Christ that’s hilarious!! 😂😂😂
The Adebisi shirt..... brilliant!😉
I bet that fake bird weighed a lot more than a real bird that size would.
13:10 a fly lands on his eye just before the bird hits
I will never not see weird al getting shot with a marital aid in the thumbnail.
That Fabio head looks like JP Sears after getting some much needed botox...
that thumbnail caught me off guard
one thing i really appreciate but was left out of mythbusters were all these safety briefings.
can i be honest .. that did not look like a bird in the thumbnail .. this looked like something 18+ content
That's 16'30" of my life I'll never get back.   Time well spent, I'd say...
When I saw Adam washing his shoe, I thought it was in the lube bucket
The bird she tells you not to worry about 😂
Legit thought a D1LD0 at first!
Fabio knows
Next could you get bird dummies with fake bone to further simulate what it would be like to get hit in the face with an actual bird
Every time I see this thumb nail I swear it’s something else hitting his face
I just showed up here to state that your projectile looks like a d1ld0.  That is all.
yes this is very much a bird but my mind is playing tricks on me I think he got a bit of it in his eye
14:31 The expression on the face of the Fabio head right here almost looks like he’s enjoying the impact… You okay dude? Your brain isn’t too scrambled is it? Okay, let’s get this guy to the ER.
But do we know whether Fabio was _pursuing_ the goose?🎢
This is the the male fantasy.
THAT DONT LOOK LIKE NO BIRD IT LOOKS LIKE A MF BAD DR....IT DONT LOOK LIKE NO BIRD!!!
the dreaded jizzgoose to the face
that was so much fun thanks
i used to watch these all the time, randomly popped up again. seeing gavin with grey hair was just insane forget how fast time goes
the bird looks like a dck sometimes
Adam laughing is one of the happiest things to experience.
Oh dear god, the eyes!
seeing Adam in the field again and excitedly laughing like this brings joy to my childhood heart. youre a hero and a saint Adam, never stop being you.
looks like Kamala Harris campaigning
i wish myth busters was still going
7:45 I lost the bird XD
iNCREDIBLE
did NOT think that was a bird from the thumbnail...
Finding out that Bobby Fingers is one half of the comedian-musician duo _the Rubberbandits_ was a pleasant surprise.
The moment the greased up goose vanished up into the tube should be used as PSAs for flared bases.
Adam sounds like killer from one piece.
The big diffference between a ballistic duck and a real duck is that the real duck is significantly lighter
That doesn't look like a bird in the thumbnail.
I was driving 🚗 a car with my dr windows down had a hawk on a telephone ☎️ pole swoop down to catch a pigeon mid air and almost hit me in the face threw my open diver window 🪟 all I could see was hawk ass and talons and a pigeon 😂 like we'll I dead
i miss mythbusters
This is what happens when 3 god tier YouTube channels collaborate to answer the world's most important questions.
Savage is such a funny name for a scientist
i like when that guy went "Adam Savage you wanna see this." like its not his name but a title XD
So who or what is Fabio? You never elaborate on it as if it's obvious or something.
MICHAEL JACKSON CAUGHT ON FIRE!! What...
Man clicked cause thumbnail. Man read title. Man disappointed.
On the eye popper you killed a fly and you can see the carcass fly off lol
@TheSciencoder  veut absolument voir cette vidéo.
This video is just delightful, I just have fun watching it
adam savage hero f the my childhood
For the brits, am I the only person who thinks the dummy was modelled on Jimmy Saville
That thumbnail does not look like a bird….
nice thumbnail, definitely looks like a bird!
The pipe from the tank is waaay to small, should be 2,5” at least!
Is that dummy head supposed to be Fabio? lol   When he was on the rollercoaster and that bird hit his nose?
This video was so incredibly weird.  I loved every minute!
Why didn't the goose have a beak?
10:40 Poor bro got turned into a Blark and Son dummy
Would love to see you recreate when Randy Jackson hit that bird with a pitch, that would be super cool
this was adam savage featuring the slomo guys
Right.... Bird.... Obviously...
Adam SAVAGE !!!
that goose did not look like a goose at first
Ive never seen someone so excited to get nailed in the face by a lubed-up rubber goose
Fabio one frame, Beavis the next
man the energy he brings
_-I think this dik 💀☠️-_
the head looks like wierd al yankovic
That.... That does NOT look like a bird...  And 'covered in lube' ?  Please say it's not marked as kids safe lol
This is what I expect bored scientists to do. Fun regardless.
EXPLOSION IN LUBE
Adam got what we in the south of England call a BOOTY. This is your Boot/Shoe fills up with liquid. This is when you tread in a puddle, river, mud, or anything wet, and it fills your shoe due to clumsiness, stupidity, or bad luck.
0:03
0:3
Why are they doing this? Why I am I watching this? Why is it awesome?  Thank you!!!!
12:50 Squid Launcher OH YEAAAAAAAAH
く…くだらねぇ。オモロー
I'm from Virginia we went and rode Apollos charit at Bush gardens a week after they reopened  the ride😅
If yall could have gotten it to go straight into its mouth that would have been perfect 😂😂😂
rip bug in the eye at 12:51
The dummy face cracks me up. He looks like blonde Weird Al.  🤣
Adam Savage shoving that bird into the tube reminds me of something i saw on some not very nice parts of a furry forum
Keep an eye out for that duck!
That fly picked exactly the wrong time to land on Fabio's eyelid.
wow, flashbacks to mythbusters. awesome vid!
Anybody else notice that the recordings at 8:35 and 8:53 are from 2 different attempts? Kind of unsatisfying.
I have never heard of this Bobby Fingers fellow before this moment, and I already love him.
TBH it kinda looks like a fish
This might be the most ridiculous video on the internet. I literally could not stop laughing through the whole thing. What a fever dream of an idea, I really dont think this can be topped. True art.
Where’d he get that goose?
The goose really looks like
Nick confirm if you drive into a goose at 75 miles an hour is going to like hell
Man, seeing Adam makes me miss mythbusters
I love how adam savage is in so many different youtube videos from different creators, always tinkering.
Just the dummy's face is worth watching over and over.
The thumbnail 💀
Serious Mythbusters vibes
The Birthing  Lube!!
My brother took a Sparrow to the chest at 80 mph on his bike once...Bird exploded, he had to pull pieces of bird beel outta his chest, and had a bruise the size of texas for about a month!  It was bad almost took him right off the bike!
The Mashup nobody asked for but everyone wanted
Man I remember watching Adam unveil his Mk. I Chicken Gun on Myth Busters. How far we've come.
*"...Fill the tube with lube..."* Adam Savage 2024.
Sorry but that's Weird Al If ever i seen Weird Al
Looks like a phallic object
bro that s*** is horrifying and absolutely more so funny
That thing in the thumbnail doesn't look like a bird...
Adam Savage and a 5 gallon bucket of lube, sounds like a good time
Adam's experience says mentor but his childlike joy and wonderment say peer........ the best combination of both!
Ngl When I first saw the cover pic I thought you were launching sexual toys at the manichan😂😂😂
YOU NEEDED TO PUT A BETTER DUMP VALVE ON THERE TO INCREASE PRESSURE AND SPEED . A REGULAR TURN VALVE ALLOWS PRE PRESSURE TO GET THROUGH BEFORE YOUVE EVEN FULLY OPENED IT
Bobby‘s face was like: "not impressed."
the fact that the slow-mo reaction shots were inspired by mythbusters and now you get to gather around with adam savage to react to the slo-mo is phenomenal!!!
14:34 14:35 weird faces that you should pouse the vid for
I want to be as happy as that fabio head
Okay, next video they need to do is use the same air cannon, and shoot a rubber fist at a rubber ass sex toy.
To be fair, birds are nowhere near that dense/heavy, but the bones would really sting. I know someone hit by a duck while doing *ahem* some mph *ahem* on their motorbike. Broke their collar bone and wrecked their shoulder (they were wearing leathers too). Entrails everywhere apparently.
I have that same lubricant. The stuff is great on a water bounce house or slip and slide.
Appolos chariot
I wanna watch  Dan fist fighting!!! <3
The funniest thing was just loading the birds…
The video with no redeeming social value, but it's entertaining because no one got hurt.
Hearing Adam  savage laugh on set... bring backs do many good memories
I met Adam Savage twice once at brain candy and another at phoenix fan fusion.
bobby fingers did a diorama of this incident i recommend but you need a strong constitution . not for the diorama but more for bobby. hes interesting like me. you never quite know how odd you are until you watch someone who acts like you...
And I thought the Canadians weaponized Geese pretty well....
This is heartless!
I now pronounce you, honorary Mythbusters.
You never know where your career will take you.  Eventually you end up working with someone who is famous.  I've been working in television and video production for over 30 years.  At the moment I'm working with a Emmy-winning former CNN reporter who I used to watch on TV many years ago.
0:00 Nothing Sus about this.
8:32 - Please refrain from blaspheming.
.. sure that thumbnail looks like a goose!
On tonights episode of Lubed and Loaded:
I thought it was going to right down his throat lol
4:14 Same rag that Savage used to wipe the lube off his hands?
Good to see Adam Savage back Mythbusters style.  Awesome video!!!
@Adam... Why are you at the weak points all the time?
Great collaboration.   Hillarious to see fabio take it to the face.
"She might take a little force to get in but don't let go of the tail"  "Absolutely not the first time I've done this"     *what am I watching*
Fabio is still smiling
What you bringing to the quarry party?????  Fabio Mannequin head Lubed up silicone goose 20ft air cannon 80k fps camera
12:32 oddly looks like Jeff Bezos
"I can't believe his eye didn't pop out." Imagine how that sounds if you didn't know the context! 😂
that don't look like a bird
Tee hee.                   Savage Finger Guys.
I think this proves conclusively that he was indeed hit by a small piece of metal from the camera and not the goose itself. He would have been MUCH more injured if the actual goose hit him.
Nothing like the after birth of a goose coming out of its egg
you can't just get anyone to make the air canon you gotta get a mythbuster to do it hahaha
that thumbnail bro 😂💀
it's just a mask and wig but it's so gross when his eye pops 🤮🤮
Even as he continues to advance in age, white hair and all, Adam still acts like a giant 9-year-old boy that just ate an entire bag of granulated sugar xD  I love this man <3 Mythbusters was just the best, yo. It's super great to see him working with The Slo Mo Guys and Bobby. Truly a strange mishmash of quirky, scientific blokes :D
ADAM fkn SAVAGE Now you guys playing with the big boys in the top league 🎉🎉🎉
Am I the only one who thinks the dummy in the thumbnail for the video looks like Weird Al?
That's not Fabio! IT'S JEFF BEZOS!
Adam Savage's laugh is infectious.   I freaking love that guy.   Great collab guys.
J Lube is the best water based lube... if using it for other activities its best made in a mason jar and microwave to get a gelatin like consistency.
wait, you call THAT a big pressure tank for an aircannon? i can see Destin from SmarterEveryDay tell you "Hold my beer". i demand a retake with an hypersonic ballistic gel goose!
The surprise ending on Bobby's channel was.... well .... surprising!
brings a whole new meaning to shooting game
The only reason i Clicked on this video was because of the silly face getting a d!ldo slap at 75mph
When I saw the thumbnail, I definitely didn't think to myself, "that looks like a rubber bird." I'd say a more phallic shape to the face. lol
So many good screenshots to be found at 14:35 …..🤪
The dummy looks like stacy from blark and son
Why is blond Weird Al being hit in the face with a bad dragon in the thumbnail?
Did the 75mph speed include both the flight speed of the bird and the momemtum of the coaster itself for the demo?
Бачок із стисненим повітрям, віддає повітря занадто повільно через ту трубку малого діаметру. Якби збільшити діаметр трубки , зменшити її довжину тоді силіконова качка буде розганятися швидше.
at the begining,,, adam obviously didnt watch the huawk tuh girl to know how to easily get the bird in there. just saying
But a real goose has hard parts. It's amazing he lived.
“I’m gonna gonna fill the tube with lube” At the moment I’m convinced this is the best video on the Internet.
This is a lot of sexy math and science nerds in one video. Also, I live next to a river, he's right about the mud.
at 12:26 you can see Fabio turn into Bezos. Absolutely stunning
14:35 when she doesn't stop??
Looked a little like Joe Walsh right when the eye came out...
I clicked purely because the bird in the thumbnail looks like something... else
12:22 - It's now Nick Cage.
Adam Savage fake laughs like a sycophant
Ngl that thumbnail looks a little sus 😂😂.
"I'm particularly good at sliding slippery rubber toys into deep cavities" -Adam
my mum has the same in her room
Adam❤  It’s like my childhood best friend finally met with my adult best friend.
Convergence of brilliance. Fantastic, Love all the creators in this one.
So much math
14:02 How the rubber duck comes out of the barrel, like a battering ram that has a Fabio problem.  The highlight, however, are Fabio's facial expressions. Joyful, expectant, shocked, visibly struck and happy, as if after a happy ending.  Adam Savage 👀🎉😁   This is an epic episode. Absolutely divine
15:23 Atleast he didn’t mistake the water bucket for lube
Adam Savage is a national treasure! This is one of the best collaborations I've ever seen.
Adam Savage is a national treasure! This is one of the best collaborations I've ever seen
It does not look like a bird in the thumbnail
fake news
14:35... Horrific xD
yeah ... "bird" ....
I loved this, but it gave me too much nostalgia, and I need the og mythbusters back
Never expected it but I gotta admit that seeing Besoz get slapped by a lubed goose is quite cathartic
it is me ...or that head looks a little bit like James May ?
I need to see Brandon Herrera, Slow Mo Guys, and Adam all together in a video now. But, I digress. This was monumental.
the fly at 12:51 (on the left eye) died for science... press F
муха на 12:51 (на левом глазу) погибла за науку... press F
I thought The Projectile was actually a Women's Toy (For more appropriated terms) than an actual Bird
This was like watching myth isters all over again. 10/10
For a moment I wondered why you were firing a lubed goose at Weird Al Yankovic, then I just felt compelled to watch the entire video.
"bird"
I cant believe i watched this lol
Fabio not looking so fabio now.
Cool, a collaboration between three creators I already subscribe to individually. Bobby Fingers is such a funny creator, so many people talk about him in bigger channels than his, yet he is growing very slowly still.
Even though this was a year before I was born. I always remember Apollo’s Chariot as “The ride where Fabio killed a goose with his face.”
Might be hands down best funny slow mo guys video in my book
I remember getting a few videos from that channel a few years back.
Would you please experiment with a soccer  ball in a canon or any other machine to see how destructive it could be if it travels at a super high speed?⚽🌪💥
When in doubt.. C4
actual impact: https://youtu.be/w9i9rwg1L_A?t=625
Yes. A 75mph "Bird" to the Face. Didnt look like a bird in the thumbnail tho. ;)
Digging that guys Adebisi t-shirt. I haven't seen  Oz in years and that character still scares the hell out of me!
The face at 14:33 had me laughing out loud 😂
The Bobby Fingers videos are amazing. Definitely check them out.
I understand it's Fabio but I can't unsee it also being Weird Al Yankovic.
Sad, I never find new channels because 95% of collaborations are done with ones I am already subscribed to. Adams safety guidelines hinder others, but, I have seen his luck and I understand why he does it.
Reminds me of the birds attacking racers in motorcycle racing (MotoGP and Isle of Man TT)
....I wasn't  the only one waiting and begging for one to hit the mouth straight on, was I?
'take a goose to the grid'  whatttt even the hell did you just say
It's so great to see Adam is still enjoying just messing around with ballistics jell and air cannons all these years later 😂Never change, Adam!
When I woke up this morning I did not imagine for one second that I would encounter the term, 'Test Goose' before tea-time!
14:35 Omg HIS FACE, IM DEAD 🤣
This is just so stupid and I love it dearly.
11:17  why does he look like he’s running towards the princess / main character, and it’s a slo-mo shot of him, and he’s the main characters love interest ???
The synopsis of this video by itself is extremely random and seeing it actually happening is even more hilarious. You sirs have won the internets today!
did anyone else see the fly getting decimated by the bird? lol
This is what the internet is for XD
Когда ковбою нечем заниматься он начинает заниматься всякой хуетой  😂
My girlfriend has a “goose” like that
ahahahhahahhahaah!!!
ngl that "bird" looks more like a...    uh..       mayhaps, something that goes up in the...       ..rear? Perhaps?
Someone probably suggested it already; but now do a bird filled with bones against a zombie head
Netflix: are you still watching?  Someone’s daughter: 14:07
Adam is insufferable
I fr thought that the gel goose was a d*ldo
Suddenly, I fully understand all the old men who are so insanely passionate about what they talk about and their immense knowledge of the subjects. I don't know why it never occurred to me before, but I watched Mythbusters in its entirety, and now realizing that show started 21 years ago.  Adam was much younger, and so was I.
We need a slo mo guys and Kentucky ballistics collab.
AWWWhh, I wanted to see Adam get hit in the face with the gel bird. No fair, Clickbait.
NOW, make som 12 gauge goose and send to Taofledermaus
What a laugh. And edumacational too
The wind noise is so incredibly bassy, it shakes the room when watching through a proper sound system hooked up to a TV. Since it isn't an integral part of the video, it wouldn't hurt to put a low-cut (or high pass) filter over the outdoor camera audio.
The Adebisi T-shirt!
I wish I could just sit on a lawn chair and watch that happen.
Slow mo guys and Adam from Mythbusters, my childhood wrapped into one
I liked how we got to see all of their head scratching math at the beginning, growing up watching myth busters as well as SlowMo Guys I just assumed they were just really quick with their math
How did the dinner go???
The thumb nail is very interesting
Hi guys. Would be cool to see a slowmo of chemical reactions, like this one. :) https://youtube.com/shorts/aeyTVmZGBu8?si=X_azdTcA1P5Pixys
So we can do all of this, but still cant get a clear film of ufos or cryptids.
Oh it's a ballistics goose
This has strong "Chicken Cannon" vibes from Royal Canadian Air Farce in the 90s
Prince Charming!: nooooo!!!!
How much this Camera price ?
Fair play Bobby!
Same. This brings back memories of Mythbusters, one of my all time favourite shows.
10:06 saves everyone's time
I liked adam back in the day but go look at his website and see his true colors. Sad
The Adebisi shirt 😂
I'm sorry but that thing looks like a d_ldo.
Girl: "I bet he's out there talking to other women" Boy: "75MPH BALLISTIC GOOSE!"
Adam finally broke down and opened his secret trunk full of “birds.”
My definition of "kiss" has expanded dramatically
So we’re just not gonna talk about the thumbnail?
Thank you for this absolutely amazing episode. Seeing a collaboration between yourselves and Adam Savage filled me with great joy.
I have been hit by a fish doing 65 knots.
14:35 pause  This frame
Open-face helmet wearers,take note !! Oh no,that's me ??.?????
LOL the eye pop overshadowed the fly they absolutely obliterated.
Meh! You can do better.
Giant Slug :)
my man that does NOT look like a bird in the thumbnail
14:34 was just the best time I could've hit pause.
I literally thought y'all shooting someone with an adult toy 😂
10:49 does Fabio look like 1970s Ted Nugent to anyone else?
неправильно делают, надо трубу в 3 раза длиннее, запорную арматуру по диаметру трубы, спусковой механизм из рессоры, баллон с запорной арматурой должен толстой трубой соединяться, а не тонкой, возможно вместо баллона длинную трубу использовать желательно с рабочим давлением не меньше 200 атмосфер, и сами трубы надо к бетонным блокам крепить, ещё раз предупреждаю, очень хорошо крепить к бетонным блокам
Bird bird bird. The bird is the word.
1 fly was harmed in making of this video lol 12:50
Jeffery Bezos origin story. He just got his hair smacked off by a rubber goose
Adam making sure he doesn't blow the guys. ;)
That J Lube is a right pain in the ass to clean up... pun intended
Good ol J-lube.
I use to laugh at that Fabio story until i seen the slow motion footage. Now I feel sorry for the poor guy. I am sure the goose didn't fair out too well either.
Might want to re-think that thumb nail guys.  LOL
10
The eye pop 😮
14:34
for your dream of life-extension 8:30 10:08 12:12 12:50
Now thats funny!!😅😅
thats some "angry bird" reference right there
There's a flaw with this test. Fabio was traveling towards the bird. This dummy head isn't.
I thought that was weird al
1:30 what a way to get into it
Seeing Adam Savage, the Slowmo Guys, and Bobbyfingers all working on a project definitely harkens back to the good old Mythbuster days of a bunch of nerds getting together to put together an experiment. I wish there was so much more of this kind of cool and fun science floating around in the mainstream of entertainment.
https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxBKrrN93W7r4jOhW6UQPf1JZXrPUALV06?si=kc239uWJVpAXakhU
Какое-то дерьмо
Adam 100% used the lube rag on his face 😆
a bird us not as dence as ballistic gelly
Bobby fingers is essentially nogla from vanosscrew
Adam looks like adam sessler with that hat and sunglasses
My favorite thing is seeing how much fun Adam is having with this ridiculous experiment
Adam out here filling tubes with lube, greesin this bird and poppin it in and shooting his load
The first image is very ugly and full of disgust. Your taste is broken. Channels are now set to hidden.
8:50 save 16 minute
I just had a similar feeling... how did I get here... why am I watching this... and why am I so engrossed?
Love this collaboration! Very fun guys. I knew exactly what happened when Adam fell in the clay. I got into some clay like that while visiting my daughter in Arizona. My son-in-law was taking us to Meteor Crater, and we got out of the car to take some pictures of the mountains. I was wearing brand new Doc Martin clogs, that have an open back, and lambs wool inside. I managed to not get the clay all the way to the wool, but that's because it was building up thicker and thicker on the bottom of my shoes. We tried and tried to scrape it off, and I even used baby wipes. It finally came off after walking and scraping on concrete for 4 hours. My son-in-law has lived in Arizona his whole life, and thought that's just always how mud is everywhere. Their house is actually right next to a hill that has 1000 year old native ruins on top. They use the mud/clay, and there are even a bunch of broken pieces of pottery. He does his based to keep an eye on it, as it isn't counted in the known Spots that the state and universities mapped out. It's no wonder the Navajo made so much beautiful pottery.
This happened to me on my motorcycle. Thankfully i was wearing a full helmet, but it still hurt. People who ride with no helmets are crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOEcuaiPwXM 💁‍♂
why is Weird Al" Yankovic in your thumb nail?
That is a goose? I could have sworn it was something else.. Something of the adult toy variety..?
Your mum 9 months before you were born:
13:42 - Yeah, pick it up off the dirty ground and stick it right in your mouth...
It's always good to see another video with Adam Savage in it :)
Adam Savage has been the coolest guy too me since I was a Kid.
Thumbnail knew what it was doing.
ohhh i did NOT think that was a bird when i saw the thumbnail...
This dummy face is very creepy, it reminds me of the female disguise Arnold use to pass the customs on Mars in Total Recall
I love how Adam is always so happy and excited to do these experiments.
these rubber heads are not accurate, realistic or simulating a human head. just saying. these videos are so dumb
looks like something different on the thumbnail......................
Stupidist thing ive ever seen.
"Absolutely not the first time I've done this." 9:21🤣
To be Nicolas Cage for a second: 12:25
Where is Jamie Hyneman? Already died?
Поздравляю с первыми трансгендерами - победителями конкурсов красоты для женщин.  А вы швыряете дилдак в лицо мужику.
Cool. I think I could watch an entire show of Adam Savage doing this kind of thing. Keep this going.
So close to the Hot Shots: Part Deux chicken arrow.
The collab we all needed...
14:35 is the Bee Movie Face :D
RIP the fly that landed on the mask @12:52 lol
S o much fun watching this
Younger, I have seen exactly that, except it was real live chicken, industrial grade cannon and a piece of fuselage to test, with slow mo camera, lasers and all. It was fun. They had problems with PETA of course hahaha
12:52 RIP fly
UE 4 in action. Shame
Goose? That thumbnail looks like something else
I thought this was mythbusters when I clicked on it. I wonder how often it actually happens? Eg. seems like another good reason to wear a helmet when riding a motorcycle.
Pause at 14:34 ...
Gavin bought his sunglasses at Next. Nobody needed to know this but here we are
12:48 Did anybody else see the mosquito?
Love it
14:35 is definitely going to be someone's new profile picture 🤣
Nerds Laugh so hard at some Odd things. Love these guys
This felt like a fever dream when I first watched this without knowing what this setup referred to but it made figuring the incident out way funnier. Proper gen X meme.
The face at 14:34 🤣😂🤣😂
Hell yeah
@12:51 That fly picked the exact wrong moment to land there
the first 7 seconds of the video did not feel right..
Fabio turned imo Uma Uma for a moment at the end
Why women don’t do this kind of stuff?
I love Adam!
Самое странное порно из всех, которые я видел...
Это Джэф Безос? 😅
He is still smiling.
Only Adam would rent a bigger truck to fire a bigger gun😂
Imagine being a fly and getting smacked at 75+ mph by a bullistics gel fowl and crushed to death...cuz that is sure the life of this fly at 12:51 on the eyebrow where the eye pops out lmao
Как постарел
Dyslexia clickbait - I read Adam savages bird to the face.  Still, it was a cool video!
WHY IS THE MUSIC SO LOUD
thats not a bird, thats a weird dild*
I am convinced that Mythbusters is responsible for a LARGE amount of the content on my favourite channels.
The time it took me to confirm you where not saying "Goose" or "Bird" as a synonym of something else...
How did you get the head from Art Attack? 😂
0:15 not exactly what I was thinking..
thank you for another scientific video
This is completely inappropriate. I've heard rumors about Adam diddling his sister back in their youth. This is not appropriate.
Some B commentary would be nice sometime
I am rolling on the floor laughing, and right next to me is this guy's eyeball!
that dont look like no goose mang
This is the best thing I've ever seen in my life!   I love each of you for making my fever dreams come true ❤.
That ballistic head is real happy to see a long silicone item covered in KY.
Gavin seems way too salty towards Adam
Fabio took it on the chin.  And the mouth, and the nose, and the eye...
MAGICAL ❤
I never thought I'd see Adam Savage with his hand in a bucket of j-lube
why not just slide the lubed bird in from the other side lol
weird al gets lubbed bird in the face video
Why does the dummy look like "the head" from 90s art attack 🤣🤣
Fabio still smiling after every goose to the face 😂
When the bird hits it looks like Weird Al.
I like how this started as a beautiful recreation of an incredible historical event, but turned into how many times can we shoot a fake bird at a fake head till it breaks
The face at 14:34 😂
I came after seeing the thumbnail. but It's not the video I was thinking of haha.
all these science-types and everyone still uses mph... use metric.
A real conversation, that's just happened:  - Hey, watcha doin m8? - I’m just watching a video where silicone geese are born at high speed right into the silicone face. - uhu..uhuu...get out to touch some grass please?
3:58 what a sentence 🤌
😂😂😂😂
Thumbnail looks like a put blug
남자 네명이 오일을 잔뜩 바른 존나 길고 거대한 하얀 것을 구멍에 쑤셔넣으며 연신 신음소리를 낸다. 이윽고 남자의 얼굴에 쏴버렸을 때 그들은 환희로 가득찬 탄성을 내지른다. 그렇게 그들은 몇번이고 남자의 얼굴에 싸질렀다... 그 남자가 망가질때까지...
8:37 that's what I call Tuesday nights
why? the whole video I was asking myself, why?
Danny Carey didn't deserve this.
Adam Savage is absolutely delightful. 😂
So was that  the first rebird?
you bozos talk way too much
Did you guys move to the U.S so you could do insane stuff with guns and whatnot? I'm way out of the loop.
I love when insane nerds have access to big toys. I don't think it would've worked if they weren't wearing white lab coats because scientists always wear white lab coats. I love that MythBusters Adam and Jaimey are your heroes. The fact that this even exists is hilarious. The tail in the neck was a final "Screw you". I sure hope Fabio is OK. This is funny to watch, but it happened to a real person, and I hope he didn't break his jaw, or anything.
wow channel is failing so bad you had to bring in the has been. have some dignity call it a day you have done everything worth doing its slow mo once you seen the cool things its over. your 15m subs have long since moved on your just left with the fanboys and a few under a rock newcomers now. PURE GREED i look forward to the further decline of your audience
That does not look like a bird in the thumbnail. lol
fun fact, one of the 1953 Jaguar Le Mans race team drivers was struck in the face by a bird when he was traveling  ~130 mph - it broke his nose but they went on to win the race anyway
This is art for art's sake.  The link to the Bobby Fingers video is all the justification anybody will ever need.  Spoiler alert: Fabio gets goosed in the end. (or in the face, depending on how you want to phrase it.)
Young gav reminds me of dr who
"No one asked us to do this" literally someone asked for this specifically xd
Shouldn't it be "take the goose to the grill"?
The slo mo music gives me vibes of the judge Dredd movie with Karl Urban
that frame at 14:35 🤣
That looks more like a dragon than a bird. If you know you know.
“Bird”
Adam just casually brings an aircannon😂
You know someone saw that lubed up goose flying out that tube and got some ideas..
I grew up near buschgardens and my mom lived here when the goosening happened. Every time we rode Apollo's Chariot she'd always joke "watch out for a goose"
8:29, 10:07, 12:12, 12:50 and 14:07 for everyone with short attention span.
It looks like weird al
should have done the last shot filled with the rest of the bucket of lube, just tilt it back and fill it from the front
Hi gentlemen, I wonder How fast does air fill the vacuum and could it be filmed? Im wondering how fast a propeller should spin to cavitate in the air and if its even possible.
Okay. Ive seen this video (namely the cover clip) an untold amount of times and lemme tell you, that does NOT look like a bird smashing into that fake head 😂
The incident happened 25 years ago when Fabio attended the grand opening of the ride. The ride is still in operation today. No bird strike has ever been reported since. Gives you an idea of just how slim the odds of that happening was.
Priview look rather not like a bird
Thats so funny.  In summer camp we had a guy who would bring in this powder for our slip n slide into the lake and the slide we also had in the lake.  I remember thinking “why is he putting baby powder on that slide?” And then he wet it and boy did we have fun!! He explained days or maybe weeks later that it was used for lubing up your arm to go inside a horse to help them birth a fawn.
Really feeling that Adebisi shirt. Lol
Who would win?  Man living his life  Vs  Bird with nut all over
It’s a shame that Jamie has gone quite
The hair on Fabio is just glorious!
Lube tube
I miss mythbusters. Such an awesome show.
Imagine being the fly lading on the eyelid @ 12:49
yeah... bird... that's what that looks like.
Dummy pov: 😀 💥😀
as someone who rode apollo's chariot as a kid dozens of times, this video is horrifying to me XD
You guys should check out some of El Estepario Siberiano's crazy drumming. Would be a cool collab.
am i the only one who think that in the thumpnail it looks like a d*ldo?
poor fly at 12:54
"Its hard to aim something so long!" "I have tons of experience with that"
Suggestion Box : Would really love to see a Brad Nailer and powder-actuated nailer in slow-mo!
Can I like this twice?
That first picture looked like something else lmao
"Supersonic Goose" is a great band name.
3:10 is that a LGBT wrist watch belt? motherfucher gav 😡😡
next "rubic speed player"
i really hope i can meet adam one day
"He's just a friend"
4:38 is what you came for. just kidding it actually took them 12:10 to show what you're looking for.  I hate clickbait
Mythbusters will and will always be the OG
with the thumbnail I thought this was going to be a different kind of bird...
Why does the dummy looks like al yankovic
What are you guys doing to Danny Carey's head? Tool still need him on their tour..
I love how seeing this as a video, instead of Adam in an episode, normally in mythbusters we saw the exctatic, crazy, excited man, I always wondered how they dealt with safety behind the scenes, and this is a nice little bit around 2:25, seeing him just "hey, do these things, lets be safe" which, as a kid, I probably would have been like "but I wanna see the FUN science parts now!" as an adult now, I appreciate yall showing him do the whole safety thing, which from my memory, the show of mythbusters, while always praising safety, kind of took that at a back seat of showing the BTS of it.  and then a minute after immediately "I think we dump most of this bottle and then we'll get our LLUBE"
Deliberate thumbnail. That DOES NOT LOOK like a bird.
The best part of the entire thing was Fabio later releasing a statement indicating that he believed the event to be an accident. What, did he believe that a clandestine real butter Kabal was trying to take him out due to the damage his "I can't believe it's not butter." campaign did to their industry? And that their weapon of choice would be a low flying goose?
sounds like antijuice propagana from people who criticize them you big nosed silly people.
whys the music so loud in the begining?
I'm sorry, but that's not a bird
GET A JET ENGINE!!!!!!!  thats what the geese are for! firing into jet engines!  surely someone will graciously donate an old turbine?
Oh yeah!!! Do a sort of "still frame imaging" of the bird in one place but as the inpact changes the shape...  In other words, remove everything except the bird from the clip and focus on the bird as it impacts and rebounds...
Vector trying to fit the piranha into his Piranha Gun:
why did the dummy head look like a blonde weird al???
mmmmmm
“goose”
I had to screen capture at 14:34, that's gotta be my new profile pic. 😆
Mudskipper is extremely fast i want to see it in slow motion how it moves
"At this rate, I've got about 3 gtas in my lifetime"
That is NOT a goose there on the thumbnail
a woman will be happy with that ''goose''
14:02 idk why, but that goose just looks really angry, like its charging lol
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.  A bird in the chops at 75 mph has got to be at least twelve or so.
8:48 When a cute girl walks by
Personally think a new mythbusters cast for a show is starting to form everyone’s video got so many views so quickly. A streaming service show of some kind would likely be a massive hit we all miss this kind of humor and trial science please continue seeing you guys laugh and have fun and mess up and oopsies and the awesome results is like watching mysthbusters childhood such an amazing nostalgic feel
Corridor Crew has a fancy new air cannon; you all should team up.
am I the only one who saw Weird Al in the thumbnail?
Can you hurry up?
Hearing Adam do a countdown to something about to be fired out of a cannon was unexpectedly nostalgic.
The thumbnail definitely looks like something other than a bird
Yall did Danny Carey dirty on this one lmfao
Is it weird that the target looks like a blonde Weird Al to me?
BIRD UP!!!
Ааа так это гусь я думал фаллос летающий 🤔😂
you forgot , goose is 2x lighter, birds are build different than mammals.  Balistic gel is for mammals
Two of the classic crew videos are just better.
while it wasn't a goose, and i wasn't going 75, I have hit a bird with my face on my motorcycle at 60... it was not pleasant
Can you do a collaboration video with NileRed and several chemistry demonstrations like the Iodine clock utilizing the high speeds and macro lens or even challenge the two practices of Chemistry and high speed macro/micro/nano videography ?
This ensemble is so fantastic
seeing yall get to basically do mythbusters stuff with adam is so freakin cool.
0:00 I’m mature
Hope Fabio never sees this...might give him flashbacks.
What happens if you put that lube on a Slip 'N Slide?
This is the vibe that this channel has been missing for a while. Genuine fun.
Bobby Fingers is the best YouTube account in 2024. Fact. Don't reply.
lol nice Adebisi shirt
Fine science gentlemen societies in science era I imagined is exactly like this 😂
15:37 i don’t like clay. It’s slippery and slimy and it sticks to everything. Not like here. Here everything is soft and smooth. Like you.
"wake up babe, new episode of Mythbusters just dropped!"
Adam Savage just comes ALIVE in this setting. so so so awesome. loved this!
Can someone (Slo Mo Guys or BobbyFingers) put up the video of the fist-fight between Dan and BobbyFingers?  That'd be a great watch
Interesting video.. I'll wait for the Parody on The hub
i dont want to watch a whole ass documentary just show me the damn bird
dear lord that bird does not look like one
4 inch from the tank would help with velocity of the bird
I never want to see any of this again, but at the same time I’m so glad I saw it
Make a video of an hour glass that lasts 24 hours for its hour. With dynamic views multiple angles and maybe a tune. I would watch that forever over and over again!
weirdest video i've seen so far
animal what?
The collab that should have happened long ago!!!
Adam Savage: "Safety, safety, safety. Word, words cool stuff. Safety, safety."
🐦‍⬛🕊️ or 🖕?
That’s so stupid! I love it! ☝️😂
Did anybody else think the thumbnail was a butt plug and get click baited?
these guys were just having a good time. last scene you can see a little water pipe and beers. Just having a good time
they did NOT just use the same lube they use at furry orgies to fire a ballstic gel ballistic goose into a ballstic test dummy face
Can we just stop and really think about how amazing this kind of collab is?
Narrator: You might thinking to yourself, why is a ballistic gel goose...  Me: OHHHH... it's a goose...
0:39 yo Gus? #talesfromthestinkydragon
Adam Savage is a national treasure and must be protected at all costs.  Preferably by very clever boobytraps
It's fun when you meet your heros and they don't disappoint.
Missed opportunity to have had @KentuckyBallistics along for this one.
Hi Adam ✌^^
Used to like Savage until he spouted his TDS. Sorry not sorry. Trump 2024.
Those poor Mars Yards haha.
Hats off to Gavin Free, the one who's too awesome to fade away like the rest.
It's wild to see Adam act serious and have safety in mind after watching so many mythbusters episode,
gavin’s monologue of his idol adam savage seemed heartfelt. thanks for another high quality video, everyone!
When I first saw the face, I thought it was Danny Carey from TOOL 😂🥲
Sir  pls answer my  question that if rolling shutter speed is 20ms and shutter speed is 1/16sec(62ms) so brother frame has information bw 0 to 20ms brother am I right ? Thanks for your help
dude the head looks alot like Sharlto Copley
The epitome of boys will be boys, laughing at something ridiculous that they made.
Can you please destroy a Bolognese tear in slow motion🥺
you guys fell off
😂 What a hook!
If you want to get me to watch a video, have Adam Savage in it.  I don't care what it's about, if Adam is there, so am I.
That ain't no bird, that's a Birldo
PLEASE look into making a barrel sealing piston valve! You could easily get 3x the velocity over using a manual ball valve.
I've watched this episode several times now and I have to say that the head looks more like Weird Al in a blond wig than it does Fabio. Jus sayin'.
AFLAC!
Damn no high speed footage of Adam falling over in the mud....Maybe next time.
Bro just happened to have a spare Fabio skin face! 🤣
Classic OZ
Danny Carrey's face hit by a bird.............guys.............. have some respect!!! lol
This is so scientific
no bugs were harmed in the making of this video
Here is an idea for a video.... Pls type in the title: How do airplanes fly? What Neil deGrasse Tyson got wrong about Bernoulli. It is on the channel of Fly with Magnar. In his video he shows a slow mo at 4:15 on how air travels over a wing. (represented by smoke) But this slow mo is not up to the standards you guys produce.  Would it not be a nice idea to have a video showing what actually is happening with the air in front of a wing?  Just an idea.
Watched you from the start, how far you have come from filming in your back garden. Well done guys, another awesome fun video. ❤
Looks like a….
Man... I felt like a kid again watching this. Keep being awesome guys ;)
And in all those moments when the bird hit the head, a thousand avatars were born.
why does the dummy look like "normal" al yankovic
0:06 - That's what she said.  5:06 - Did anybody else imagine the Six Million Dollar Man sound effect watching this?  8:55 - Peak lovecraftian, right there.  12:28 - Big Jim Carrey energy, there.  14:34 - Reminds me of the Thing.
Can't believe that Dan didn't get to introduce himself in the intro this time.
Have you guys tried backwards drink can opening, its like a gun
Subscribed to all three already, my brain is going "whut? Whut happun?!"
Everyone go watch Bobby fingers this happened because of him
The head looks like a blond Weird Al Yankovic
Now that's some real life cartoon footage right there! Awesome video!
12:12 12:50 if gerard depardieu got what he deserved...
I haven't watched Mythbusters in years despite wanting to binge the entire series. I'm pretty happy to hear that Adam's hearty laugh at the sight of a solid slow cam, goofy mistake, or result.
The lube tho… i can’t believe it’s not butter spread
"A very particular set of skills"
Пз как дети малые... Интересно сколько стоят их игрушки...
Where is old stormy when you need her
"does it say not to?"
Having been hit in the helmet by smaller birds at motorcycle speeds I can say 1000% I NEVER want to hit a goose or even worse a turkey (which I've narrowly missed on multiple occasions).
Did you and B Fingers really get in a fistfight?
Why does the thumbnail look like weird al?
I'd be interested to see *how* fast you could get the bird going with Smarter Every Day's baseball cannon
that thumbnail is wild
Stayed for the entertainment, came for the NSFW thumbnail.
I've got plenty of experience aiming long things too - I own a Mosin Nagant.  ;-)
That looks more like a dragon than a goose, and not a good one
We just gonna ignore the dilly at the end there? 😂
it's funny, if you google that j-lube stuff, the first application you find isn't for giving birth, kinda the opposite
Bobby Fingers, the Slow Mo Guys, and Adam Savage walk into a bar...
please do slow motion beyblade battles with metal fury
Why did I think Adam was the test dummy-
I lube the tube too, before inserting the Bird. Like always though, fires off too fast.
I love the moment Adam lost the bird down the barrel
Never heard of Bobby, but what a collab. Quality laughs were had.
So y'all are a fan of Adam, and Adam a fan of y'all? That's epic!
<<< Thumbs up right here if you spend all of your time vicariously living your fantasies through people like the Slow Mo Guys and Adam Savage!
Bobby Fingers one liners through out the video were priceless.
I have a grave shaped clay pit in my yard and that stuff gets permanently bonded to everything it touches. I would have washed my shoes too.
I love Adam's safety briefing. We've all seen him do this stuff countless of times, things going south as well. He knows this stuff and you want to listen to him if you don't want to get busted.
10:50 Fabio turned into “Hey you guuuuuyyyss!!”  Aka Sloth from Goonies
12:29 Jeff Bezos ladies and gents!^^
14:35 pause in that
Them: It's such a surreal moment Adam: Slaps silicon bird on a metal tank
This is so wonderfully gross 😂 excellent
Bobby Fingers' videos are amazing in quality and humor. I hurt myself laughing watching his videos.
14:34 TOTAL RECALL moment.
Haha! The moment I saw the thumbnail I knew who this was about. I'm a veteran rollercoaster anorak.
You should set up an event where people can bring a project they want to see in slow motion.  You could charge a crowd of people money for tickets, make money and upload the best bits to youtube.  You could turn the slo mo show into a huge festival.
NGL the thumbnail definitely didn't look like a goose 😂
this has to be an all time number 1 video
So when are we going to see Fabio's reaction to this? (yes, we all now know that he was hit with a camera part, which flew off after being hit by a goose. This shows what would have happened if he had been struck at that speed by an actual goose).
Why?
I remember when this happened. I was in my early 20s......now I really DO feel old lol
I really thought the "bird" was some kind of innuendo for... something else.
My sister got a duck to her face at 105 mph when we were on our way back from the Sturgis rally one time.  I saw the whole thing from behind on my own motorcycle.  We were all passing a couple cars and it came out of the ditch.  Fortunately my brother in law was the one driving.  He saw it coming at the last second, leaned to the side and dodged it.  My sister didn’t see it.    When it hit her face it got deflected almost strait up into the air and came down in the opposite ditch.  It was dead on impact.  My sister wasn’t wearing a helmet but she had some tinted safety glasses on which probably helped a little, but she ended up with a bad bruise on most of the left side of her face.  Somehow nothing was broken and her eye was okay.  The running joke after that was that my brother in law said duck but she didn’t listen. 😂
I looked it up.  A bird did not hit Fabio in the face.  The bird hit a camera, and a piece of camera hit Fabio.
Why does the head look like Weird Al
“Bird”
4:13 tell me youve worked with air compressors without telling me youve worked with air compressors.
It feels like little Mythbusters special episode
So YT decides the QI segment and this one should appear side by side, I've got the humour out of the way and now for the science.....
After all these years you are still wearing the same lab coat how does that thing not just fall apart at any moment
The thumbnail looks like weird Al yankovic
thats a butt plug
14:35 looks like something out of a Ren & Stimpy cartoon.
For sure the best youtube thumbnail I‘ve ever seen. Pretty amazing story telling
Has anyone here ever been to Norway?
that was be an unfortunate way to go lol
My friends would be still slapping each other with the ballistic geese.
you guys have to colab with @HydraulicPressChannel Like if you agree
Bobby's video   https://youtu.be/2RIEPKEhE2s
Van? 😭
*quiet contemplation*  "I'm startin to think Fabio's tellin the truth"
Hey, I would love to see some red sprites in slow motion, not sure if it's anyhow possible but that would be extremely interesting!
If you haven't watched Bobby Fingers videos, stop what you're doing and rectify that now. Man's an absolute genius maniac artist.
True Adam Savage moment in the end.
thought it was Blark in the thumbnail
Fabio has never been more excited in his entire god damn life for this goos to hit him
I grew up watching Mythbusters and The Slow Mo Guys, so this is a wonderful collab. Wouldn't hurt to do another, yeah??
You and Adam need to get together with Brandon Herrera and do some shots with his .50 BMG Ak he made
You guys should reboot the Mythbusters
I’ve always appreciated Adam’s unwavering enthusiasm. That guy embodies loving his profession!
I hit a bird at 160 kmr on my motorbike while knee down in a corner, the bird flew out of a bush hitting the front of my right shoulder and it just exploded. A mate riding his bike behind me, said he saw the bird fly out and just explode in a shower of feathers and other bits and pieces, thankfully I was wearing full leathers, but it still hurt. I had to clean bits of the bird afterwards
Math scenes are heavy in this one
this  IS   what i neeeded
It's all fun and games till someone loses an eye.
Bobby Fingers deserves every last view he gets from this.  He's awesome.  Always wondered why his videos didn't have a billion views.
So next balloon video is gonna be Dan in a lube balloon right?
My dad looks like fabio but he wont admit it
Hell yeah the classic Apollo’s chariot goose-plant!
No one is going to ask if the slomo guys actually got into a scuffle with BF?  Ok, I will.
It makes me happy to hear Adam speak fondly of Jamie even with their differences.
That head simultaneously looks like Fabio, Weird Al, Jeff Bezos and James May.  It's honestly kind of impressive.
Yeah, sure. They write "for veterinary use only" on the bottle. The chance this is getting used for its intended purpose ever is about the same as for hitachis. For 100% veterinary reference: It dissolves much easier if you dissolve it in scalding hot water with a whisk.
Oh that’s a goose I thought that was something else
talk about fast food
Love that adebisi shirt, great show oz was
Came here from Bobby Fingers, and honestly, this isn't anything like the wildest thing he's done. The Jaff-Bezos-head-coracle wins that.
Great video.
"Huh, I wonder what Adam's up to these days. Launching lubed up rubber geese at fake Fabios you say? I'm down." I know that Adam has done so much more after Mythbusters, but this one is so out there.
Riding through west Texas on my way to El Paso from Dallas, I saw another biker going the opposite way get hit straight in the chest by a buzzard.  I have no idea how fast the bird was going, but the rider was going at least 80mph which is the speed limit on that stretch of I-10.  Somehow, he kept his seat and was able to slow down and drop his kickstand before falling over.  I immediately turned around and got on the eastbound side.  He had two buddies that had already called 911.  I stayed until the paramedics had loaded him up to take to the Hospital and rode his bike following.  One of his buddies gave me a ride back to mine.  I got one of their numbers for an update and to check on the rider.  When I called the next day,  they told me the riders heart had stopped 3 separate times.  He had a broken sternum, multiple broken ribs, punctured lung, internal bleeding, bruising to hit heart, and portion of the birds beak and skull embedded in his shoulder.  Rider survived and was riding again within 6 months.
Color it and add a cape, it's not a goose, it's Darkwing Duck!
Anyone ever film a speaker blowing out as it happens in slow mo?
Next time do the same but with SmarterEveryDay's supersonic air canon.
Its nice to see the old Savage again.
If this is an episode of Mythbusters... what is the myth that's being busted? 🤔
12:25 bro immediately became Jeff Bezos when losing his wig
Fabio without the hair looks like jeff bezos
legit did feel like an old mythbusters ep, well done
Bobby F to Adam S to SMG ... best trilogy ever
more of this sort of thing
i did not think that was a bird
The head looks like a blonde Weird Al in the thumbnail
If a fly hits you in the forehead at 100mph it will go through.... its own ass.
That doesn't look like a bird 😳
Ohhhhh, it's a goose
lol
why would they do that to weird al :(
Gavin, i envoy your opportunity to create a relationship with Adam Savage. He formed my childhood and life into what it is now. I wish to meet him some day, but also don't want to be a bother to him.
What a laugh
Oh it’s a goose! I thought it was something rude
huh ive used jlube so many times and never knew it waas animal birthing lube
Made me feel like I was watching mythbusters again
"and then he turns to me to check if the phantoms are ready" i started empathy crying omg. what a feeling it mustve been :)
Wasn't it clear enough that the goose was the lady on his left that broke his nose probably during the ride???
That first shot went from Fabio to the dad from Coraline.
God I miss mythbusters
Hey Slow Mo Guys, so were the files corrupted then? or did you make that up?
epic
Dude just took a silicone toy to the face😂😂😂😂
I bet a real face would look a lot like the Fabio face before it recoils back to semi normal.
This might be my new favorite video on the whole internet. Working with Adam is a such a dream for so many of us who grew up watching Mythbusters, and remembering back to when you guys were just filming random stuff exploding in your back garden to this is so surreal.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY GAVIN!! ITS MY BIRTHDAY TOO
That's Fabio?! I was going to say you guys did Weird Al dirty! 🤣
Funniest thing I have watched in freaking ages!
How amazing to see a video w/ Adam Savage and the Slow Mo Guys. I so miss MythBusters.
Makes me miss mythbusters
My bestfriend told me he was biking not too long ago and a Crow just flew into him while it could easily dodge him lol
If only they used a cockerel
The thumbnail doesn’t look like a “bird” to the face! Hahaha
I think a cool slo mo video would be a stream of oil and water colliding
Adam and Gavin yees!
Something else seeing bobby fingers on this hahaha
should have got the voice over guy from mythbusters to do a few lines
That must have been so cool!
I actually remember when Fabio got his nose broken.  I don't know the guy, but my Dad laughed for some reason. That was 20 some years ago.
I think it will be interesting to see sandblasting in slow motion, seeing the tiny particles stripping paint or dirt could be cool, also seeing spray paint could be cool, as kind of the opposite
Such a silllly goose
There is something so surreal, and so satisfying, of seeing both the Slow Mo Guys, and Adam FREAKIN SAVAGE, on the same quarry range, doing something utterly absurd, and having such a blast doing it!
anyone else excited for giant balloon june?
thanks for launching a bird at Jeff Bezos's silicon face
I really really hope we see adam on this channel again. I think it's a perfect match
0:15 Nice of you to imply I knew what I was looking at
this feels almost exactly like a mythbusters episode
I didn't think that was a goose
I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT  I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT I AM AN ADULT
The thumbnail looks like the Blark puppet from the show Blark and Son, utterly terrifying
the thumbnail does NOT look like a goose...
your videos are what youtube was made for 👍👍
J-Lube is a classic. It's one of my go-to products. This stuff is so slippery, you have no idea. Just spill it onto a smooth floor and it will get more slippery than wet ice. It's pretty much impossible to walk on, no matter which shoes and how grippy the shoe sole may be. It's also great for pranks: Cover someone's car with it. It's very hard to get rid of that stuff. You want to wash it off? Sure, keep adding more water and make it even more slippery, but it won't go anywhere. And if you need a lubricant for "certain activities", if this lube isn't slippery enough, nothing else is. Also, when it starts to dry out, you can always add a little water and it'll be back to normal. So it's super long lasting and you only need tiny amounts of it, unless you want to make entire buckets of slime, making it actually pretty inexpensive in comparison to other products. As long as it stays dry, it won't ever spoil. Even after 10 years, it will be as good as on day one as soon as you mix some of it with water. Give it a try and you'll never want to use another lube again. And yes, it won't affect latex or any other materials. But again, serious warning: If you accidentally spill it to the ground, immediately use towels to soak it up. You could seriously hurt yourself if you slip on it.
5:39 If you listen closely, you can hear back-of-the-napkin math being calculated while internal hard drives are being spun up looking for the formulas.
Fabio losing his wig looks like Howie Mandel lol
"The mechanical coupling between the bird and the face." -Adam Savage
I haven’t enjoyed a project this much in forever!
"It's just best if they're unconscious." - this moment brought to you by Adam Savage, the real one, not the watered down Discovery Channel version. Oh and as Adam says, don't swear kids. It's cool when adults do it, but its gross when kids do it.
Even though this took wat felt like forever; when it connected and it sure did connect with my and it was soooo touching;; truly one of the speeds that a device could capture visual ingotmation at was used in this here video;;;; and it's a swing and a hit no fence in sight;;;;;;; Also this Slow mo guys thing at the top of this webpage that I'm randomly on is... ... Well is okay.   Okay.  And okay one of these okay video, right?   Extra okay perhaps. I think actually no. Just normal and singular okay.  Okay.
Why don't you guys ever film the eclipse in slow motion for us o see, uncut?
I love Adam he just loves having fun and I admire his enthusiasm 😂
Yall know damn well that looks like a pen15
Not the mars yards!!!!
12:29 jeff bezos
We're in track & field season in Iowa and I would love to see a SloMo video on a long jumper landing in the sand!
When Adam laughs🤭😆🤣
The Best collaboration ever.
Where's the @Fabio
Yoooo!!!!! I live in this state! Wtf?! Where was i? Damn! I missed it!
Fabio!😂 just saw a video of him getting hit dsy ago😂
Adam Savage is such a happy chap
The sound i made when i saw this title
M A J E S T I C
I realize that the bust is supposed to be Fabio to imitate that time Fabio got hit in the face by a goose on that roller coaster, but I can't help but think it looks like a blond Weird Al
With respect to Bobby Fingers, I submit that the entire internet asked for this.
The thumbnail looks like Weird Al getting hit in the face with a sex toy.
The piano music plays, a touching monologue by gav, truly a emotional moment.  Adam with the latex goose: WACK WACK WACK
0:30, Did his mouth REALLY have to be open for this shot? Looks so wrong XD
Hey guys! I really think you guys should shoot stuff with a high powered gas blowback gel blaster! It would be awesome footage in high definition slow motion and the expensive gel blasters shoot little gel balls that explode on inpact at 300 fps+  Please consider my idea! Thanks :)
Pausing at 14:35 might be the most nightmarish frame in this video. And there’s some steep competition
I require more episodes with Adam Savage.
AWE MAN THE DISRESPECT WITH THE THROAT CHOP 😂😂😂 took the eye and finished with here dont breathe 😂😂
DOOOOOOD I MISS THE GOOD OLE MYTHBUSTERS DAYS now we get to watch adam live on yt an just womder where jamie is in life an hope th best
You guys should have put a fake bird skeleton in the ballistic gel to be more accurate!
That thing looked like a dil     dole
Fabio got goosed 😂
Love seeing Adam still in action doing what he loves
Thats one way to force feed someone
Damn I do love Adam Savage.  Although he never responds to my comments on his channel :(
I never thought I'd see the day when Gavin and Dan make a video with Adam Savage
Did Adam savage watch the MotoGP at Phillip island?
"don't worry Fabio... people won't be talking about this 25 years later.."
Have you ever quack a duck with some lube ?
why not put a big canopy over the camer/replay thing.......instead of trying to use your hand???? or am i just etarded ?
Do the same thing, but this time with Dan's head instead of Fabio's
"Thats some good blow"
"I got tons of experience with that." Brilliant !
Not gonna lie, the thumb nail did not remind me of a bird at first glance XD
14:05 Just like being born. So beautiful ♥
This was  E P I C !  🤩
https://youtu.be/qQKhIK4pvYo?si=x0CGIUoEJRgi-AxG 🙏🙏🙏
I love how Adam Savage just shows up sometimes.
Amazing Collaboration.   Would love to see more with Adam.  There must be some myths Adam would like to revisit with better high speed camera technology that the Slow Mo Guys can bring to the Party!
What a combo! A very obvious natural fit.
This is the super colab i never dared dream of, heck yeah!
I saw Adam savage and my first thought was, “I never saw this episode of mythbusters
truthfully looking at the image, I didn't think it was actually a bird....
Excuse me, have you seen my bird😮
13:03 if you run it backwards is a heartwarming story of a floppy eel returning fabio's lost eyeball.
12:28 From Fabio to Jeff Besos
Are these guys grown ups? 😅❤
Wig flew
14:34
Wonderful.  What fun.
12:58 Fatality Bird Wins
This is the collab of all collabs…in order to fire gelatine at latex! What a time we live in!
Am I the only one who thinks homeboy look like Vasiliy Lomachenko ?
What is the word?
who won the fight
I know I actually was getting ready to skip the video because I thought it was a commentary on a mythbuster video
Was hoping for a ballistic dummy head can’t believe they didn’t use one
I just watched the Bobbyfingers video! Was the fight real? Or just all part of the joke?
Video pauses at 0:15 Goose: “Yup, that’s me! You’re probably wondering how I ended up in this situation.”
Love the Sloppy Joes shirt
I want to see how high the bird would go and then of course the impact on the ground
Fabio
Adam Savage... What a legend. You guys are so lucky and awesome.
ویدیو عالی  امیدوارم یوتیوب فارسی هم مثل شما بشه
While 9mm may blow the lungs out of the body  This blew the hair off the target
The Cult of Bobby Fingers is now global. In a world of war, pestilence and destruction we must treasure such renaissance men
Pause as 14:34 you will not be disappointed
75MPH, 75K likes
the collab we have all been waiting for
Looks like a very excited Hillary Clinton taking an intimate toy to the face. Nightmare fuel.
That eyeball shot at the end was like a slow ballet of chaos! 😂
Adam having the "educational dad moment" about the clay at 15:40 lol... Instant nostalgia
Question..🤔🤔🤔 What would happen if you fired a metal bullet at a magnetic helmet could you possibly repel it? And.. Could you get the metal bullet to speed up when it gets close to the magnet if it's pulling the bullet? ... I have a feeling the bullet may just be moving too fast to do anything!!
Mythbusters influenced a whole generation of youtubers and it's amazing to see that the science goes on ! Cheers guys, wonderful episode.
It's Simmons
Adam being such a potty mouth is awesome. Makes me sad that we have to censor just like TV, even on youtube.
That did not look like a bird, lol
Is that a Weird Al head bust they are shooting at?
That doesn’t look like a bird in your thumbnail and you know it.
Have been waiting for the savage team up for so long, I knew the day would come. True mythbusters at heart.. 👍
Sus
Bobby <3
And always remember: the difference between science and screwing around is writing it down! All things considered, he's lucky he only came away from it with a lacerated nose.
Thanks for having Adam on the channel. Next: real bird and ballistic zombie head.
Glad to see an old Canadian weapon design repurposed for peaceful scientific pursuits>  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLJ5q3-XJtQ
So you guys ARENT mad at eachother?
@13:00 should be the thumbnail!
Bird???? 😏
Do the same thing again but much bigger and with Richard Hammond instead of a goose
So was the fight in Bobby's video just a bit?  Ya got me!  I like all your videos, but this collab is my new favorite!
Things I never knew I needed to see. 1. A bird to the face in slow motion...
But what about the fight? Who won?
Anything with Gavin in it is just absolute quality. Inspiration for me starting my own channel here
lolll so weird but satisfying at the same time hahahaha
Oh... It's a *bird*... yes, of course. Not sponsored by baddragon then!
7:30 "its just best if theyre unconscious" 🤣🤣🤣
Yes J-lube… for animal birthings… 👀
Absolute dream collaboration.  You love to see it.
I did not know there was a fellow Irish man on slow mo guys
Great video! But for an experiment it's not a realistic model. Birds have a beak, a skeleton and most importantly muscles that will push the beak further into a persons head
this is so stupid it's AMAZING!
I am pretty sure that's Danny Carrey from TOOL and not Fabio! Just saying.
looks like Data from star trek
And they say the perfect job doesn't exist. This is AWESOME!!!!!!! 😆😂🤣😂😆
Am not a fan of the news, or social media watchamawholouts; thus I have no idea who this Fabio person is or what the goose reference is about. But, the slo mo gooey goose making contact did remind me of several scenes from Alien Prometheus though
I don't know how much would it hurt and how much damage would the bird cause, but it's clear how much you would taste it.
“To the grid” 😂
Приятно видеть что легенду не забывают
Fabio to Jeff Bezos in 30 miliseconds
How cool is this collab!? Congrats guys
love this guy
0:26 Looks like Otto Waalkes in the 90s, a german entertainer. :)
Not gonna lie I only clicked because it looked like MTG was being shot in the face.
finally a video with Adam where the camera doesn't fall over
My other have regularly uses that exact brand of lube! For making mega bubbles. Along with fairy liquid, baking powder I think and warm water. Creates bubbles bigger than people.
This video is like the history of youtube in a video. I'm still trying to figure out what a guy making miniatures of Mel Gibson's dui arrest has to do with hitting Fabio in the head with a air powered goose gun that Adam savage shows up with... ohhh wait ya he did get hit in the face by a bird on a roller coaster a long time ago didn't he lol. Still wtf why? lol, slo-mo is def cool though
I’m sorry to anyone who’s ever uploaded a video before, you’ve lost this is truly the video of all time   You can’t start a video of a lubed up rubber goose hitting a guy in the face out a 20ft pvc pipe then talk about mel Gibson getting arrested for a DUI all within a minute
Thought this was the squid launcher from Despicable Me
8:10 is the bird to the face
It would be really spooky if Fabio blinked just before being hit by the bird.
man that thumbnail caught me offguard big time. looks super suggestive haha
14:34 Haha that face
Seeing Adam back in this kind of environment is just glorious!! We need more of this....
What a day with da boys
So, are we not mentioning how that duck doesn’t look like a duck? 😂
14:35 🤣🤣🤣
Are you guys in contact with TAOFLEDERMAUS at all. Would be a sick collaboration!
Nice way to catch a fly at 12:49
IDK why but that image at 11:00 is just haunting
Ты тоже увидел ФАЛОС вместо гуся вначале видео? 🤣🤣🤣
More Adam savage collabs for sure! Match made in heaven.
12:26 The Fabio head turned into Jeff Bezos in slowmo
While you’re taking a goose to your gob,  who's looking after your kids?
Poor weird al
This one reminds me of vector’s squid gun for some reasons
can you guys do a bouncing betty in slow mo? could be an interesting challenge to avoid camera damage
15:00 is a classic adam savage moment
Came for Adam, stayed for Adam. Slow Mo Guys 🤝 Adam Savage
Fun. Fascinating. Nightmare fuel.
So who won the fight between you and Bobby?
Adam Savage is a legend
A fan for fabios hair would add a lot to this.
Now imagine how many people were inspired by the Mythbusters to retain their inquisitive interest, their childlike sense of discovery... All thanks to Adam and Jamie... Then watching the next generation meet up with the legend who is still so down to Earth yet retains his exuberance for the adventure of discovery in ridiculously over the top hilarity. Who wouldn't love this? 👍😘❤️
Myth busters is just begging to come back
I'll be honest scrolling through my recommendations and see that bird hitting the face and it looked like a different gel object...
The thumbnail💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Be cooler if the bird had bones
That is not a bird bros...
yo that adebisi shirt is dope
i want to belive that adam was driving by and saw them doing this and joined for old times
I'm just waiting for a narrator voice to pop out and say "On this episode of mythbusters".
Well, that is the single most "you need to click me" opening over ever seen on YouTube.
This is great in so many ways. It was hilarious, Adam "F*cking" Savage, ballistic birds with cow lube, and I road that same coaster, the same year that Fabio got goosed and remember laughing about it then.🤘🤘
My most preferred part of the video is instead of hearing the legend himself Adam Savage explaining what he's doing, we get to hear blasts of wind in our ears
That Mel Gibson figure looks like Ray Liotta in Bee Movie...
Just hearing Adam countdown from 3 to 1. I grew up watching MythBusters and it brings back so many memories of me and my little sister, watching to see what crazy thing they did next.
Fabio on Apollos Chariot.  I'm a huge roller coaster nerd. This is fantastic. What an incredible life Adam has had, just a nonstop maker his whole life and still doing it just as enthusiastically today.  We know he's done this before. And he's still like a kid seeing it for the first time.
I scoured the comments and found no mention of it, but am I the only one who thinks that bobby sounds like a calmer Nogla, not just the accent, but the pitch of his voice
14:30 😂
13:06 AJ Hawk
And today on Mythbusters, Adam teams up with youtube legends theslow mo guys and bobbyfingers to see if a bird that goes 75 mph can obliterade a humans head.
the Fabio mask looks like a chadified Weird Al
Ohhh. THAT kind of bird. See, I was told a bit of slang probably a decade or so ago..
Please please put a real... dead fish in the canon please!
Adam Savage gave us all such a great childhood! 😊
thats a weird lookin bird
As a man called Fabio not knowing about the incident with the model. I got quite concerned with my safety when i heard a goose was going to be flying into me at 75mph🤣
I've watched this twice and each time it feels more like an accident we might see on the set of an "Adult film", than a bird.....
I love Adam Savage, and I love Bobby Fingers!
You played the worlds most expensive game of splat the rat 👏👏
My absolute favourite extra from The Expanse
I didn't think it was a bird ... Dirty mind I guess
Artists are weird.
New found fear
*loud fangirling noises*
I hit a bird on the autobahn in germany going about 110mph. It splattered like blood filled water balloon all over the car. It dried almost as soon as it hit and I had to find a car wash while looking like I just drove through a set of Carrie. No damage to the windshield or car somehow. It just went into mist.
Adam!  Your Tom Sachs Nikes!   Nooooo!
Adam Savage just bringing the safety, and I was not prepared for it.
Why the hell haven’t they teamed up ages ago
"its hard too aim something so long" .......story of my life
Adam casually wearing a Omega Speedmaster while cleaning his dirty shoes 😂
BoobbyFingers is doing a wonderful Irish Jamie Hyneman.
Adam and Slo-Mo Guys, best collab on YouTube EVER.
Those of us on motorcycles know this first hand
Adebisi
"The mechanical coupling between the bird and the face" is now a phrase I've heard. Unfortunately. What an incredible video
He just slips straight into MB mode with gags, antics, and over-the-top reactions.
This really happened to a friend of mine. A big bird was on a train back in the 1980's. Back then air conditioning here in Australia was opening the windows. Well she was so unlucky to have a bird fly through the windows and hit her in the face. All I can say, is it did a lot of damage to her face. Because of the beak it ripped her face right open and it almost killed her.
Nah, what are they doing to Trevor Lawrence man.
Gavin wearing a Sloppy Joes tshirt in a video with Adam Savage is the funniest thing I've ever seen
Yeah, that absolutely does not look like a bird in the thumbnail :)
The majestic bloke looked like Jeff bezos when the wig came off
Perfect collab hell yes.
Didn't think I needed to see this. Turns out I was wrong. I definitely needed it!
20 years later, when asked about the infamous bird incident, Fabio stated, " I can't believe it's not better. "
Adam savage, doing exactly what he is used to doing for over 15 years on tv
Anyone else think the face looks like Goobertown hobbies?
Excellent. This is the right amount of absurd.
@4:14 the sound of the pressure sounded like that dr.dre song right there he would be like "da da da da da it's the mothaF****ng D R E"
Seeing that thumbnail, paired with “Adam Savage” and “Bobbyfingers” sent me for a trip, if I didn’t know who they were I’d be concerned this was on the wrong video website..
3:57 play this part out in the subway max volume
Wait that was a goose?
Gav: “I just found that moment so fulfilling.” Adam: *smacks goose’s head against tank*
👍
that is not a bird 😳
12:24 Fabio became jeff bezos
Collaboration of the century
“He took a duck to the face at 250 knots” Cayce Pollard
Why are you throwing birds at blonde Weird Al?
The teardrop under the right eye (left side of the video) at 11:12 💀
Click bait, Adam Savage doesnt actually get hit by a 75 mph bird...
This is the second worst lubricated silicon object you could could have shot into something mouth
14:34 Attack of Titan giant energy xDD
That's actually Adams B-plug, classic liberal. I'm sure a few of you saw his infamous spread eagle b-hole pic years ago.
The ultimate mythbuster’s team
ohhhh..it's a bird...wasn't sure by the video thumbnail....IT'S JUST A BIRD PPL
"..absolutely not the first time I've done this.." had me dying.
There is always time for lube
6:12 The moment I heard a sentence ending on "something so long" I knew what was going to happen. 😂
12:13 how to turn Fabio into Jeff Bezos
Get on a highway and film bugs vs windshield slow motion
That bird looks like a bird.
its clear the amount of fun Adam and crew have doing this.
I'm so happy Bobby fingers is getting his recognition. It's so beautiful to watch. And this sillyness is absolutely what the Internet needs. And the Internet used to be.
More collaborations like this!   👍  😎
I have been hit in the shoulder by a meadow lark flying up from the side of the road when I was riding my motorcycle doing about 70 mph..  that hurt and my arm went numb for about 20 minutes...
That's no goose...
Sir? SIR!?   HMM!? Grab me that goose
Anyone else noticed that when they knocked out the eye, they also hit a fly that landed on the head.
I got as far as the thump-thump.
Just saw this and had to click on it because your guys' videos are cool and also Adam Savage is in it
My boy bobby getting his flowers!
I want to hear the non-recorded jokes.
Seeing slo-mo and adam savage together was a dream of mine. Thank you both.
I'm sad you didn't add an industrual fan to get the hair moving majestically. Oh well. Next time!
For anyone wanting to know, this experiment was inspired by the time Fabio visited an amusement park in Williamsburg Virginia as a promotion for the opening of the then tallest roller-coaster (apollos chariot) and while riding it, it was so high a bird just flying by smashed into Fabios face, this ended up being an unfortunate event, Fabio was mostly fine, and the amusement park ended up installing nets to prevent this from happening. The ride is still functional to this day, it’s one of the more popular ride there! I live here and it’s a pretty well known story around these parts, who would have thought it would have led to a slo-mo guys/myth buster inspired video 25 years later? Pretty dope
Adam Savage’s laugh is one of the few things that makes me think the world is gonna be ok
Yesss Adam Savage × Slomo Guys ❤❤
it turns out that watching this whilst eating is not recommended
And that's why you should always wear a full face helmet when riding a motorcycle
Great video. I can’t recommend Bobby fingers enough. Big recommend
Fabio without a wig looks like a tripped out Jeff Bezos
"Get in ya pup" 😂
14:30 hilarious
makes sense that a bird would be aerodynamic...   not so much for artillery use, but still
This sounds like fun. Couldn't help finding joy in this video.
Ultimate edgelords
Adam is absolutely in his element in anything involving air cannons.
this was weird but a lot of people liked it. I can't complain.
We love the bobby
If I'm being honest, I wasn't wondering why a ballistic gelatine goose covered in animal birthing lube was being shot out of an air cannon; when it comes to the slow mo guys and adam savage... honestly, nothing seems off the table in my mind.
Those are no birds  Those are toys
Hitting Fabio in the face with a goose  Now THAT's a deep cut
MOAR! Please?
"lube shot in THREE       TWO       ONE!"  was not something I anticipated to hear tonight.  But thank you!
Collabing with Bobby Fingers is the most insane thing you've ever done
They didn't put him on the roller coaster
1:31 bro went back to the 1800s 💀
14:32 is my favorite
Their whole crew was stressing trying to find out how fast that bird was
for the impatient people 8:33
that Face is super happy to get it on his face.
Gav: Shares heartwarming perspective on how much this surreal moment means to him and how grateful he is.   Camera: Cuts to Adam Savage beating the goose against a tank so it's unconscious before launch
We just re-watched the MB episode with shooting the frozen chicken vs. thawed chicken with my kids in April.  It's nice to know that knowledge gained with that rig is still useful today  :D
So did that fight after bbq actually happen?
Maybe you should have got the supersonic baseball cannon from "Smarter Every Day" in the act.
Cane here from Bobby Fingers. Epic collab!!!
Is that a S.  E.  X TOY
Are those the $3k mars yard shoes???
https://youtube.com/shorts/6UbKSeLaY1Q?si=hoBLuP9w0nPfG740
came here from Bobby Fingers. Great to see you and 'mythbusters' finally getting the exposure you deserve
4:00 savage wiped his face with the lube rag
Watcing at 3:20 Like "oh yeah, buy lube, that's what I left off the to do list..."
In the thumbnail, thought that goose was a...
Adam Rocks!
Animal Birthing Lube is both a substance and a phrase that I think I genuinely wish I could forget existed.
I love Adam running around like some chaos goblin....
my childhood why am i actually crying
As a Hampton Roads resident in the 90’s, I appreciate the Fabio reference so much.
loved seeing a safety brief for this :)
Did Bobby really fight the slow mo guys?
Yeah but who won the fight, and what did Bobby find on Gav?
Ngl in the thumnail that does not look like a bird
SUBSCRIBE TO BOBBY, PEOPLE!!!
6:11 "its hard to aim something so long." "I have tons of experience with that." **slaps Dan's back**
Thumbnail sus. That ain't no bird.
This feels just like a new episode of Mythbusters! I used to come home excited for the next episode, It’s so awesome to see Adam and Slo-Mo guys together!
Surreal!
I miss watching The Mythbusters tv show
You sure that's a bird
Adam Savage is awesome. Mythbusters made being a nerd cool.
I love to see Adam on project like these again. It just feel nice and so nostalgic!
Love seeing Adam savage
10:27 So gel... solid or liquid? Is there a debate, how fast can gel interchangeably go from solid to liquid and back again? Was that not a display of changing the state of matter also?
Maaaaannneeeee is this because Fabio got hit by a goose on Apollos chariot? 💀
It looks like Fabio was in the middle of saying "eat me", but the bird cannon interrupted the 'me' part, but Fabio still finished it with the birthing lube dripping out of his mouth like a G 8:53
I clicked on the video and I almost regretted it the second it started playing
So at a certain point if you launch a ballistic gel goose at a Fabio face it becomes a Randy Quaid face??? Fascinating.
Now that the barrel was lubed.... that's a line
You guys finally figured out to put Adam Savage in the title instead of just Bobby Fingers?!! Good for you! Idiots.
Gave me serious Mythbusters nostalgia 🥹
Oh wow, Adam upgraded to a OneWheel GTS even after the collarbone incident, cool to know!
6:22 I think thats a certified "What the Hell are we doing?" Moment
That was a special video felt like mythbusters :)
This is one that DEFINITELY needs to be played on loop in front of Apollo's Chariot (as you go in). xD
That didn't look like a goose in the screenshot
what uh.... what lube yall using? no particular reason
Adam is an awesome dude !!!!
I can tell how much respect you have for adam by just putting his complete safety instructions uncut and unedited in the video
15:00 So quicksand is a real danger?!?
Love the project. NGL, the plumbing on the air cannon is a huge restriction and kinda disappointing. We all know you could get a little closer to the supersonic goose. Piston valves.
14:34 why does the dummy look like red skull after Cap shield bashed him, just happier🤣🤣
But...why?
This is amazing! I grew up watching every single episode of mythbusters! And this felt like an amazing new episode. Felt like seeing old friends. Love it. I hope to see more collabs! Brilliant!
Can we all agree that Adam's laugh is the greatest of all time?
bunch of dudes doing math lol at 5:44
Humm note to self.  Do not eat dinner at the samevtime as watching this.
I'm starting to think Fabio is telling the truth. 🤣🤣🤣
jakosc lepsza niz moje oczy🫣
I never thought a video of "Weird Al at home and blond for whatever reason" getting smacked in the face by a suggestive looking object at high speed would exist, until now
Bro I did NOT think that was supposed to be a bird....
please more Adam savage!!!
oh that was a bird like projectile in the thumbnail . . . kinda looked like a di..
12:25 The impact was so strong it turned into Jeff Bezos.
This is like behind the screnes of mythbusters i looove it!!!!
First thing i thought of was Fabio lol
This video has made me so happy!
My father once took a pigeon to the head at about 80mph, whilst riding a motorcycle.  He says he woke up on the side of the road, his visor shattered, and a concerned motorist standing over him, calling for an ambulance.  The pigeon had exploded on impact, and the motorist had thought my father had experienced some sort of catastrophic injury.
10:55 The expression on the glancing blow reminds me of the Didney Worl meme face.
I wouldn’t want to stop trying different experiments with him, so glad he’s still active!
anyone else infuriated by the cuts basically just picking random clips instead of the right ones? "oh his eye went out" *shows footage where the eye stays in*
Glam from Metal Family😂😂😂
Glad I'm not the only one who saw weird Al in the thumbnail
Y’all lost a sub if ur gonna show the impact at the start don’t then just cut it off right at the impact. And u did it slow no aswell like ok waste my time harder
That's not Fabio, that's clearly Danny Carey
Adam Savage laughing is very effective  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I thought the thumbnail was a Weird AL album cover at a glance.
Bobby fingers is criminally unsubscribed
Those delightful existential moments of the pioneer, in between 'How did I get here?' and 'Nobody ever said THAT before!' via 'Its better if they are unconscious...' 😆 The Making Of Legend. 👏👏👏
Why don't they use ballistic heads for this type of experiments? That manequin head throws away all the cientific interest.
I love the fact that Savage has not stopped doing fun, ridiculous and random things since ending mythbusters and is still putting smiles and laughs on people faces across the world enjoying himself on the camera
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RIEPKEhE2s
Adam Savage with the slo mo guys :0 YES!
Yep a lubed gel goose is definitely what I thought it was
Who would have thought that four of the goofiest men alive all coming together to replicate one of the goofiest events of all time would be so...goofy?
Hell yeah. So awesome, that you guys came around to film with Adam. He's a legend.
so was the fight real?
Looking like dee snider 😂
Wondering if either of @theslowmoguys have ever been to Norway
March 30, 1999
this happened in germany with a tesla a few years back, it caught on fire and the doors wouldnt open since there is no mechanical connection...locked four 18/19year olds in the car, the driver and his girlfriend next to him managed to escape the car severly injured but the two 18 year olds in the back died, one died either at or very quickly after the crash itself, but the other was proven by autopsy to have burned to death, tesla says the door handles on the outside could stick out in the "unlikely case of a collision" but they didnt. The internal doorhandles failed since the electronics gave out immediately when the fire started, the backup mechanical unlock was located underneath the floormats...a forensic accident analyist has claimed in court that the door handles not working and the backup not being accessible due to safety belt and airbags were the cause the second one in the backseat could not be saved. they are thinking about sueing tesla for that because a normal car with a regular mechanical door handle would've allowed her to be saved from the car, her injuries wouldn't have necessarily been fatal as the autopsy report showed. the driver was arrested after his release from hospital but sentenced according to juvenile status, he got a 3 months driving ban but will only be provided his license again once he presents a positive med psych eval (~1500-2500€) and had to pay a fine as well not sure what that was
I refuse to believe "grid" is british slang for face.
I don't get the reference,  but hilarious
A fantastic video with all my favorite people! If you guys do this again, add feathers to the bird, please.
..........im sorry.......but that ugh.....looks phallic.......
Three of my favorite channel creators in one video?! Best day ever
He had his wig snatched lol! 😂😂
You guys know, I watch YOU guys because it reminds me of Mythbusters! It's always Surreal seeing Adam in your videos.
Rubberbandits forever!
There's no way that first shot was 75mph. That was weak AF
Not sure how old Adam savage is now, but WHOOO he has not lost an ounce of his infectious energy!!! Thank you for blessing our screens after such an amazing run with Mythbusters <> 3-2-1------->AWESOME!!!!!
I love how when Adam slaps on a pair of over-sized shades and Bushman he immediately turns back into 2006 Adam Savage.
14:35 is amazing.
0:26  is that Danny Carey of the band Tool...!!???....?? ..m...mmmm.... 😮🤔 Yup... Yeah.... Yeah it has to be, if that's not modeled after Danny Carey the drummer from Tool.... Well hell if you don't believe me..  just look him up! 😂
surprised he put the tank to pressure then got in front of it to load the bird? maybe the excitement got to him?
RETRIEVE THE TEST GOOSE!
Hell yeah an excellent collaboration.
it looks like a flying wad
trifecta!
"bird"
YES YES YES YES! The crossover dream we've all been waiting for! I'm so glad that Gav and Dan got to film with Adam!
that did not look like 75mph
I mentioned the Bird-to-the-face Fabio on a whim to someone a couple weeks ago and now here we are. What a wonderful world of coincidences. 🥲
The thumbnail is... interesting. Taking a page from Charlie's book, I see.
this has got to be one of the most legendary colabs ever, such a good video and massive nostalgia had me gremlin laughing all the way through
You know you've made it in life when Bobby Fingers asks for your help
Lubed birds to the face?
What was Adam riding @ 7:12?
Who is Fabio?^^  I mean I am called Fabio, but I don't look like thst guy^^
12:50 + 14:58
Is that the biggest ball valve? That air "cannon" was pretty underwhelming
Gavin Free and Adam Savage teaming up sounds like an Avengers level threat if I'm being honest.  I'm all down for it. XD
@6:12 I have tons of experience with that 😂
Adam is such an iconic yet humble guy that you geek out about him for like 2 minutes and then you both geek out together about whatever you're working on, I love it.
Thanks James Hetfield for this experiment.
can we get a slow motion 75mph fish slap ahah
13:00 yo i actually had a dream the other night where i popped out my eyeball from my socket while looking in the mirror it was wild.
this is golden material
You know when I first saw this in my feed, I though it was a re posted section of a myth busters video haha.  Awesome stuff :D
awesome
This is Youtube
What kind of "bird" is that?
Vetlube is also used as sex lube
Thiss felt like mythbusters behind the scenes . Incredible
Thoroughly enjoyed seeing my face caved in by a lubed up bird.
Hearing Adam's jolly laughter at the start of the video in a dirt field firing something dangerous put a smile on my face
12:30 when he turns into Jeff Bezoz
12:30 - The moment you realise it was Jeff Bezos the whole time.
I'm starting to think Fabio got off quite lucky tbh Lol
Awesome
a collaboration made in heaven
The scene of them all doing the speed calculations was hilarious
The dummy head reminds me of Weird Al Yankovic. hehe
Paused right on 14:35  I can't breathe
I am surprised but I feel irritated to see Adam Savage there. The slow Mo's are probably more capable than Adam is anyway. I get the impression the smile on Dan's face is painted on as well. The valve between the airtank and barrel is far too small.
Fabio didn't do too well !
Adam truly is a gift to this world
A video of legends, but its the quiet Irishman who is the coolest.  Love how the video does not address the "why" and leaves that to Bobby's video
Did he swallow?
Best crossover episode EVER!
I'm curious if Adam knows who else uses that lube because I was like 😳 when it popped up
I love sloppy Joe’s
Adam stacking it in the mud 😂😭
6:13 I have tons of experience with that! 😂
Now to do it with an actual duck and balistics head see what kind of damage it does? In the name of science that is, you may get hit by one in the wild, you know how things happen
Slow mo Guys: Mythbusters
Silicone birds and J-Lube sounds like Folsom Street Fair shenanigans lmfaooooooo 😂
Can you film a frogs tongue in slow motion
So Fabio was right, he was hit by a portion of a csmera that was hit by the bird.
A bigger tank and a big joining pipe should be better and should open the valve fast
This is for you, Fabio.
That don't look like no bird, more like a butt plug.
Red dye in the lube would have been fun to see.
Great deal of respect for Adam, but man he just won't shut up. Gav and Dan are two of the funniest dudes out there, but it's their low-key banter. Bobby Fingers is even funnier (although he does such a great job on his stuff he's probably scripted it in advance) -- seriously, watch his Mel Gibson video and be amazed. But this, this was all Adam giggling and trying hard to make jokes. "It's better if their unconscious" was quality, though.
I love science
Adams laugh is so good. Grew up watching Mythbusters so this was a treat haha.
birthing lube? I can't believe it's not butter.
Bobby Finger is easily making the best videos currently on Youtube
This is why I never rode Apollo's Chariot. Never rode them, but it was the opening day of the coaster and the last day of Fabio. One of the geatest moments in VA history.
3:05 That’s the space between you intestines and the rest of the body. How would you possibly get any of that there?
This video is awesome! No goose were harmed in this video, right? :D Best wishes from germany!
In true Adam Savage/Mythbusters fashion, I imagine after they got the shots the final part of the video was like "Well, we got an air cannon, a five gallon bucket of lube, what else can we do?"
Wait - Steven Seagal got body slammed? When?
Omg please collaborate more!! This was like watching heroes come together!!
I make kettle corn. I'd love for you guys to see a slow mo of me making kettle corn.
"I'm really curious about which one went farther" is something, I think, Adam said on mythbusters.
Great video. Adam Savage is a role model of mine.
Launching a @fleshlight at supersonic speeds. Look at the load splatter! 😂😂😂
Congratulations, gavin...youve lived every millenial's childhood dream...to do weird things with pressurized air on camera with @tested...this is awesome
This team up has been a dream come true
This carries so much Mythbusters energy. I genuinely love this. It's like reliving something from my childhood
I adore Adam (and the Slo Mo guys), but Bobby's not getting enough love in the comments. His videos are literally some of the most amazing I've ever seen -- on youtube or anywhere.
Yay...!  Adam Savage rides again...!  Mythbusters lives...!   Just like the old times...   *sigh* Huh... New hat, though... Where's the ol' hat???   LOVE.
The thumbnail looks like blonde Weird Al
Eye Don't Know
Best Thumb Nail ever ! ! !
13:23 comment was so well delivered lol.
14:34 reminds me of Total Recall
12:12 kinda looks like Jeff Bezos
is this the first time Geoff and Eric have been on slow mo guys technically? (on a shirt but....:) :) Regulation appearance.
I want that Adebisi shirt
Poor Fabio.  Just having a nice afternoon, in the sun, enjoying the day.... then BAM!
Looks like we’re at Fly Geyser.
I was like "ain't no way this thumb wasn't proposital" and then 5 seconds in I *knew it was proposital.*
After Mythbusters Buster has worked on himself. He looks fabulous... from the neck up.
Ever catch a June Bug to the face at 75mph?
This was an interesting video to watch while eating
ъ..Ъ
You. Got. Adam. Fricking. Savage.
Adam always in a good mood.  He looks really good, hopefully we get to see more of him!
That thumbnail is gross looking
Doesn't look like a bird on the thumbnail mate
RIP to the bug on the eye... 😆
Adam Savage still a savage
Dip it in the lube, pop it in 🤣
Adam Savage and Gav and Dan lubing up a bird for Bobby Fingers was not on my bingo card for this year.
10/10.  11/10 would have been firing a silicone fabio head at another fabio head. "Now Kith!"
Y'all are God's gift to YouTube.
Bobby picking up Fabio's eye off the ground and popping it into his mouth without a second thought, is fantastic. XD
What an EPIC colab!
8:45 ... now THAT is a "kiss"! cheers!
most motorcyclists who have ridden more than a few years know the pain of at least a BEE to the face at 55mph/90km/h... all i can say is that even with a fill-face lid, the impact is substantial.... larger objects such as stag beetles (1.5oz) tend to leave permanent marks... i do not want to think about hitting a goose... cheers and thanks for doing this!
Absolutely brilliant video
What a surreal thing to see Adam Gavin and Dan in the frame together, what an amazing crossover. I hope to see more!!!!!
That was hilarious and deeply disturbing at the same time hahaha
The team up we have been waiting YEARS for.
"that's no goose......"  -Obi Wan Kenobi
First slow-mo video I've 2x through then just closed half-way. Mythbusters did... not age well - and yes, this is a double entendre.
Best collab ever.
That's a wierd looking bird
I wonder if Fabio will ever watch this 🤣
This is the second bird to the face video I’ve seen today, I see some major foreshadowing going on here
Fabio looks more like "Weird Al" 😂. Great collaboration, it was like watching an episode of Mythbusters. Brought back good memories.
I always go for the bargain lube! If you’re paying too much for your lube, you are a sucker! 🤣🤣🤣  And you have to invest in about 100 of those Fabio heads for future videos!
I love that you busted the age-old myth that Fabio once swallowed a goose that flew into his mouth. Instead, the goose would've popped his eyeballs out. Myth busted!
Enjoy the content.
12:50 - The poor fly!
I choose to believe that Adam washed his shoes in a bucket of lube.
It's all fun and games until Fabio loses an eye. Then it's just a game; find the eye to win.
This video has brought me so much joy
we need a goose at rifle speeds
The ratio from pure collective skill and subject is just unbelievable
Needs bigger tube and a Goyen valve. Like the Harvey Wallbangers we build.
The feeling of things going full circle here is mad, i think it’s fair to say that the myth busters influence is pretty clear in the slow mo guys content (and I meant that 100% as a good thing) so to have Adam working with them is just perfection. He also looks like the exact mix of knowledgeable, cautious when needed and totally mad that he always seemed on mythbusters, epic episode!
I immediately told mom about this! We are avid Mythbusters fans. Adam Savage is my favorite because of his humor and everything. Seeing him and the SlowMo guys finally get together is a dream come true. Please make more videos together! I'd love to see more with the three of you firing more things and just doing great stuff.
The shot of the three of them just all doing math to themselves and then checking with everyone else to make sure its right is just so funny. Imagine walking by and just seeing 3 dudes with calculators in their hands muttering to themselves I also never realized until this video but Adam sounds very similar to Bruce Greene and now I wanna hear to two talk to each other
I only found out about the slow mo guys after being subscribed to achievements Hunter for years. You guys don't upload that often. How famous is Gavin really.
lame.
Gavvy “[insert random noise]” Free and Adam goddamn Savage………MOAR PLZ
Is fabio still alive to see this and if so what are his thoughts
Why???
So that's how geese are born.
"Hell Yeah"
The Mythbusters where my childhood absolutely a W video
Calm down there, Andy Warhol.
Cant wait to see a lubed up dan climb into a balloon again, luckily giant balloon june is coming up
Never thought of seeing Jeff Bezoz in on of your videos...  12:29
Chicken cannons were used to test airplane windshields.  The story goes that they forgot to thaw the chickens during the first trials.
You mean guys, Yesterday I showed this video to my 9y old son and this morning he told me he had nightmares with that Jelly Face :D :D Poor lad....The joys of being young...
Booby fingers, Slow Mo Guys AND Adam Savage!!!! Yes 🙂
Get another piece of smaller diameter pvc pipe and use it as a ramrod to stuff the bird in from the opening. Would have saved a lot of time.
The "background" "music" is very annoying.
Oh yay an explanination of cow lube! My life's knowledge is complete.
why are you talking to everyone like we're slow?
Just guys being dudes
Weird Al?
yooo its adam savage
How much Pressure do you need to get the cow back into the other cow? 😂   Jk and we shouldn't be kidding about Cows being force-impregnated for the milk-/cowmeat industry.
That fly chose a *very* unlucky moment to land on that Fabio face :D
Dan's been working out!!
Why does it low key look like Shane from Smosh?
This is the best way to start a weekend!  Just awesome!
Soooooo if I take this cannon, put a lot of lube in it, and then aim at the "hole" and fire it, would it "penetrate"?😏
The timing of the thumbnail 😭😭 lol 😂
Screw Adam Scavenge, tell him to take anger management classes, the corpo cuq.
14:34 the face of pure joy 😃
Why you gotta do Weird Al like that?
4:35 i would not stand behind that gas tank especially where the nut plug is while its filling for sure...
First thing we see is a chicken getting stuffed in a tube. then lubed up and being flung into a tube.
I love how Adam Savage being in a quarry with a pressure tank is just automatic mythbusters vibes no matter what else is happening
Slapping hairy Jeff B with a gelatinous bird. Nice.
J-Lube is not only used to get things out of other things ;)
The ONLY thing that would have made this perfect is if they could have found the Mythbusters voice over guy from Discovery.  Is he even still around?
Some days, you just gotta... eat a bird.
❤❤❤❤
I like the math break to figure out how fast the first one went
An Irish lad wearing an Adebisi TShirt out in the desert with Adam Savage shooting geese asking how did I get here? C'mon lad.
The video I never knew I needed. Brilliant colab all my favourite people
Please tell me you invited Fabio to be there in person.
Slow mo of a jackhammer or chisel cracking concrete and ceramic. Also, slo mo of a spaghetti noodle breaking
Beware of flying birds!
You've brought the wrath of the Irish upon you.
The slow mo: 10:12
Mythbusters spiritual successor. So happy to see this!
The kid in Adam Savage is still there.
Now that’s not what I thought he was trying to shove into that tube
It's incredible seeing my longtime science hero out there still doing it with the new kids on the block... These were some epic and  actually hilarious looking   slowmo shots....😅
12:12 it was Bezos all along
I love the fact when Adam was wiping he's hands into the cloth and in the next scene putting the same cloth into his mouth 😂
Did you guys just have a competition to see how much of my childhood you could put in one video??
adam savage around ballistic gel, It's 2010, im 13 again, life is simple
A tv series with SlowMoGuys and Jamie & Adam..  That would do numbbbberrrrrrrrs.   ok at least Adam, god knows what Jamie is doing, probably living his life as a mountain hermit somewhere in the PNW.
STOP SHOOTING NORWEGIAN WIERD AL IN THE FACE WITH BIRDS!
Greatest collaboration ever. If jamie was there, it would be the cherry on top.
The frame at 14:35 is both terrifying and hilarious at the same time
This is great, guys.
Why do I feel like it's 2008 and I'm watching Mythbusters?
The best thing about the Fabio-Seagull incident was a headline in some tabloid magazine that came out right after that read “I Can’t Believe it’s Not Bloodier”  😂😂😂😂
Watching this and all I can think about is how many fossils are likely in those outcroppings.
@5:38 when all the science guys split up to do math in their heads   😅
Adam Savage language 😢
I laughed way too hard at this to call myself sane.
The only thing missing was a pair of googly eyes for the bird
I'm suing for my likeness
That look on his face should be in an ad for voting
maybe i should call him...
Brilliant show gentlemen! Keep the hits comin!!
That thumbnail is all a thumbnail ever wanted to be.
The head looks like the head from Art Attack??? 😅
looks more like Jimmy Savile than Fabio...
I should call her…
Omg 5 geniuses and all of them were trying to figure out the speed 😂😂❤❤ that’s me for sure 5:44
I want a side channel that is just Adam Savage reacting to the videos
I paused it at 13:32 and its the best frame in all of existence.
This is great. What the hell is it for? lol
if j lube is like methylcellulose powder, could you use the powder as a replacement for j-lube when the cost is higher on j-lube?
There is always time for lube 😂
Gives a whole new meaning to goosing someone.
Blark and son
The years have been kind to Adam Savage, and the nostalgia hit me like a silicone goose to the face XD
This video is the personification of how little it takes to make a man happy! and i love it!
the goose may perform better if you added a cannard ;)
Does anyone else think that around 13:05 Fabio looks like he turns into Joe Walsh?
Dan asking about "cow juice" is absolutely diabolical.
One of the strangest things I didn't know I wanted to see, weirdly fascinating . . .
13:13 rip flies
I thought bobby Fingers was Nogla...
"This is bargain lube."  Certainly economical~
14:33 - Is that an Arnold or a Ronny Cox cameo, i cannot tell...
Why did you say it’s a bitd? 😂 I can’t see any bird I see the fish🤣 Any body like me?😂
12:27 - And so the truth is out, Fabio was Jeff Bezos, with hair.
Just came here after watching the video bobby fingers did and it was hilarious that you two got blackmailed and lost a fight against him.
Match made in heaven with this collab.
Who would have guessed a bird is aerodynamic 😂
Everything about this is beyond brilliant 😆
the bird flew in the face of perfection
Why are you shooting a delto into the mouth of a mock-up of Weird Al Yankovic
Bobby going "Adam Savage yer gonna wanna see dis" just made my day
I love the sloppy Joe's tshirt
Possibly the best thumbnail on YouTube
Watching a plastic head being fed a well lubed plastic goose is exactly where I saw myself when I woke up today.
Lmao! What an opening statement!
This was a glorious collab. 🪿
Please check your footage for wind noise! It sounds awful on my sound system even with the bass turned way down
Alternative Title: Jeff Besos with long hair gets punched in the face multiple times in slow mo
When even the most respected scientists don't understand how to properly use the word "literally," we're in bad shape.
I love how Fabio slowly transitions into present day Joe Walsh from The Eagles by the end
sure. It's birth lube guys. Same factory, "different label" . Again three of my favs in the same vid. I've loving this. Four if you count the lube.   Probably will regret this comment.
Stop at 14:35 is scary as hell
Haha, that head looks like Fabio as played by Weird Al...
Hang on, Fabio is a REAL person? I thought it was just what you call camp men with long hair typically seen on the cover of flick books? A name like Karen, Mungo, or Chad.
....sure....a bird :)
That opener is FOR SURE getting this vid demonetised lol
10:33 Reminds me Bubba Junior :)
Two of my favorite groups ever
Holy hell, getting Adam Savage himself is impressive, so damn cool.
Adam Savage gives me such a bad vibe
Yeah yeah yeah. It’s just birthing lube
Get smarter everyday’s cannon
The DREAM collab
Is that head of Galadriel from Rings of Power?
thats some unsupervised kid's fetish now, i dont make the rules
Imagine how fast it would go if the valve pipe was 3" instead of 1".
I can't believe you got a legend to come on your show
As a motorcyclist I find this terrifying.  On the other hand " ya cant beat lubing your goose 😂😂
The original Myth Buster 🙏🏾
The collab we've all been waiting for!! I hope this leads to more collabs between Adam and the slow mo guys!! <3
The final shot was perfect 😂😂😂
I think I’ve been pavlov’d into laughing when Adam savage laughs I’m glad his channel is doing well
Fabio turned in bezos when the wig came off
That moment when Gav was reflecting and “it was like I was watching an episode of Mythbusters, then Adam turned to _me_ to make sure the phantom was ready” just  God I don’t even know how to describe how that must have felt, just a surreal feeling to consider and think about  This has got to be one of my favorite videos on the site
Now all we need is a fabio reacts video
the bird wins the eyeball loses
I honestly thought it's a different "bird" from thumbnail and title
I love watching you guys always do very interesting stuff keep it coming please
The stretching and contortions the "goose" goes trough after hitting is astounding to watch!
14:32 should be a meme format
Adam with no filter is so satisfying. I'm glad to see him as an adult and appreciate him as such
Never thought I'd see Adam Savage mixing up a bucket of J lube...
3 engineers and makers (maybe 4), mathing out the speed of a ballistic gel goose covered in cow birthing helper.  That encapsulates all of your channels and personalities perfectly.
i can take that goose that fast... just not to the face wink wink
Fire ballistic gel into ballistic gel
It would be epic if it was a saw dust glued shape goose instead of a ballistic gel goose. MAXIMUM DAMAGE
Pherp, I know what we’re gonna do today ☝🏼🤓
This whole video is the definition of sus haha
8:29
This is so incredibly joyful I could watch hundreds of hours of y'all just messing around.
this is absolutely amazing! what a collab guys! also, adam is absolutely quarterback-ing this operation lol
What a time to be alive 🥲
This is one of those videos that makes you realize just how LUCKY Gav was to have known someone with a Phantom camera
Growing up with Mythbusters as a kid, and Slow Mo Guys as a Teen, this makes me unreasonably happy to watch. I hope we get to see more collaborations like this in the future!
@13:05 it went from Fabio to Casey Neistat in a ms xD
I think what creeped me out the most was how far away from the Uncanny Valley I felt.
"...that was a good blow..." lol
Worst project ever!
Had me laughing like a loon too.  Spectacular!  What a team 🙂
That Fabio head made me remember that"I can't believe it's not butter" commercial.
superb very funny..
10:07 — Looks like Weird Al playing Fabio.
“We’ve assembled three masters of their craft, a sculptor, an engineer and a visual technician, to recreate a moment of history!” “Oh sweet, is it something famous or formative? Something suitably historic to be using those three experts?” “Uuuuhhhhh…..”
THE NOSTALGIA
Who else thought that rubber projectile was something else?
what a vibe
i like the idea of ballistic geese
Cow juice. Dang
Girls: solving world problems, being amazing mothers, sisters, daughters  Boys:
What a treat of a video! Growing up with Mythbusters and then being a long time sub of Slowmo Guys then you guys colab with Adam is just my dreams come true. You guys should recreate some of Mythbusters slow mo shots, yea the show had slow mo but your cameras have higher speeds and quality
That  vid pic + the first few seconds is so sus
I feel like this episode should have had way more inappropriate jokes But thanks guys, i havent laughed like that in months
NOT lubed with I can't believe it's not butter! Unbelievable!!! Who's responsible!!!!!!!
I just watched this video for only 30 seconds and I am already laughing my ass off
At 13:10 looks like he turns into that dude from Wild Times at Ridgemont  High 😂
This video was a delight!
Honestly Mr Adam needs to be a permanent appearance on some of these testing/science shows, in a way he pioneered it all with Marquettes before most of them were even born
OMG...this is the A++++ Team! This transported me back to Mythbustin' times. Deliciously nostalgic...and friggin' brilliant. You guys make more, and I'll watch 'em! 😎
This thumbnail is clickbait in a good way
Just when you think "I'm pretty sure we've filmed everything that is interesting in slow motion" this happens.  You have to love the fact that you get paid to do this stuff lol.
Slo Mo Mythbusters
Was it just me, but when Fabio lost his wig at 12:29, did he suddenly turn into Jeff Bezos?
Thumbnail looks like Weird Al Yankovic
Did anyone else think of the basketball into Dan's face video?
could you do a video on Senko Hanabi Sparklers i think seeing them in slow mo would look cool NightHawkInLight did a video on how to make them and one looked like a sun
Did you really fight with Bobby and send him the mail about the corrupt files?
Someone getting off to this, i bet
If birds didn't lay eggs and just birthed mid flight.
Loved it An awesome collaboration with one of the legends himself, Adam Savage 🤩🤩
One of the dumbest things I've ever seen. I loved it. Thanks guys.
You know you made it as a science channel when you get Adam Savage to do a vid with you. Good job boys. Keep it up, I look forward to another 5 years of watching your stuff!
Im disappointed adam didnt clean his shoe in the lube
7:40 😳
Destin's baseball cannon might help with the speed.
That is one of the weirdest things I have ever seen,
Why does it look like Jeff Bezos without the hair?? Lol
I just want more Adam and slomo combo!
some frames look like they could be a King Crimson album cover
I didn't even know the back story behind this.  For those who also might not know, in 1999 Fabio rode a roller coaster and a Canadian goose crashed into his face at 75 MPH leaving him bloodied.
jeff bezos in a wig gets hit by lubed bird
@5:43 It's such a beautiful thing to watch nerds do math...
Reminds me of my ex wife 😢
Uncanny Valley in Slow Motion
This feels like a match made in heaven that I am now shocked hadn't happened before now
Gavin finally made it to a set of Mythbusters 🥺😭
That wig makes Fabio look like Danny Carey.
Feeding the AI edge cases
11:00 That tail whip to the throat tho 💀
Can you do a slow mo video of a ballistics dummy lab in an MRI machine with a stomach full of ball bearings?
There is no one more passionate about literally everything physics and nature than Adam Savage.
What an intro!!!
You say Fabio, I say Weird Al!
I live near Busch Gardens Williamsburg, where the Fabio incident happened, and it is the stuff of legend. Is the ballistics gel goose the same weight as a real goose? Either way, incredible video.
something about the shots of the geese hitting the bust just had me giggling like there was no tomorrow, my stomach hurts from how hard I was laughing while watching this video
Sloppy Joe's! ❤
Fabio is use to taking floppy things in his mouth lol
You should really change your icon. It looks like a sloppily run chemistry channel at a quick scroll.
13:04. Fabio gets an Owen Wilson nose job.
Should've used a rotisserie chicken
Dude that was such a feel-good video, massive grin across my face the whole time
The look of pure joy and excitement on targets face while its hair blows in the wind and it gets hit with random objects is totally hilarious. How these guys weren't dying of laughter the entire time is beyond me. Lol
nerdy/ geeky chaos of this video satisfies so much. thank you for this collab
Just a fantastic gathering of people. I’d love to see more from this crew.
What a beautiful video! Feels so good to just have some classic mythbuters style sillyness
The collaboration we've always wanted but didn't know we could have
I have no idea who fabio is or why you're throwing a goose to his face haha.
You guys really need a second channel where you just post the raw footage at it's slowed speed in it's entirety. I can't be the only one who wants to sit and watch something happening in extreme slow motion over many many minutes!
What an odd video tho, like with all things you could do this is what they come up with🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣   👍👍
We need more Savage and Slow Mo Guys collabs. This was great.
I can attest to what Adam is saying at the end about the clay. I live in northern Minnesota gray clay is everywhere. If it gets on your shoes or more appropriately your boots it will stay there, and pile up sticking to itself like gum. When I was kid there was a logging road less than a mile from my house that was basically made of the stuff. If it was dry it was fine but one day after it had rained I decided to ride my bike down it. I didn't get fifty yards before I could no longer peddle because the clay had piled up on my tires so much it was getting peeled off by the front forks, and the back frame. When I couldn't pedal anymore, and had to push the bike back to the road. It's both sticky and slippery at the same time. If you tried to drive a car down that same road when it was wet the cars tire treads would fill up with clay and then slide all over the road like you were on ice. Fun stuff. Oh yeah, once it dries, it's like concrete.
Dan is looking really good these days! Good for him!
I've never laughed so hard in my life!!! 😂 GREAT VIDEO!!
the amount of immature jokes is awesome. this video is hilarious
Is it true you and Bobby Fingers got into a real fight or was it all play?
I'm half way through this video and all I can say is I'm loving it. A bunch of nerds doing nerdy stuff and having a blast, my kinda heaven lol
Man, in slow mo it looks violent. In normal speed it's kind of funny.
Wait did they move to Texas or something?
4:36 oh the nostalgia. All the other kids watched cartoons, I grew up with Adam, Jamie, and Brooks Moore.  Hearing Adam with that count down took me back. 5:58 Aint the first time he's shot a bird out of a cannon. lol
More slow mo guys and tested collab please <3
anybody need some high pressure calf discharges?
the first shot is just for the lube, god damn i love engineering
I imagine the amount of dialogue that had to be cut from this episode was quite massive.
Very satisfying 😎👍
I like that you included the basic safety directions
What a wonderful combination of talents
I saw them carrying him off in the stretcher while we were waiting to get on the ride. Wasn't missing eyes but it messed him up
Whitesnake lead singer
adam savage is an idiot
My girlfriend had one of those birds. She had a lot of fun with it.
A good way to ruin any show is to invite Adam Savage on.
0:25 actually, I was thinking "Is that Adam Savage?  What is he doing here?"
This is the dumbest thing I'll ever watch and I goddamn love it!!
That beard guy seems like he doesn’t want to be there
Adam Savage and the Slow Mo Guys collab is the crossover we never knew we needed!
Anyone remember Art Attack? and THE HEAD? I can't stop thinking it now.
cashing in my regulation listener status to a comment leaver. great stuff gav
awesome snotbird brought to you by the slomo busters
just the usual chaos of the slow mo guys frozen in time, mixed with a very wholesome undertone  and voilà: you have a beautiful video to enjoy ☺️  love it!
Looks like weird al yankavich 😂
Nobody noticed the fly you killed on the eye-pop-out shot! It landed on his eye just before the goose and got pulverised!
As someone that grew up watching mythbusters since the first episode, and now continue to watch adam on tested, iv always loved how excited he is no matter what he is doing and is always the same guy on and off screen. I have learned so much from watching him over the years its not even funny.
Didn't have Adam Savage and Slow Mo Guys collab on my 2024 bingo card.
Is that J-lube they are using? Yeah... i use that stuff to shove things in things too
This is why I pay my Internet
Adams laugh is sooo wholesome!
Bobby Fingers man... ❤
I loved how meticulous and safety oriented Adam was at the start of the video
Nice Dildoical canon you got there, really gives the thrust a hard deep punch that might be needed once in a while to have some fun. XD
And so the goose was passed from one generation to the next, as is tradition.
is anyone else seeing weird al ?
This could be Mythbusters 2.0
Shhhh shh shh ......you had me at ssssllllllooooooommmmmmmoooooooo ggggggggggggggguuuuuuuuuyyyyyysssssssss
I saw all three vids, Adam, Bobby, and you all.  Loved all three, Now mys heart screams for more collabs... Matter of curiousity, on Bobby's vid, he claims to have gotten into a fight with Dan... deep down I know that's not true.. am I right?
Why and I laughing so much at this?
think you meant "goose to the grill". not sure i've ever heard anyone call it a grid before...
A bird in the face in worth two in the groin
Please do more episodes with Adam! This was epic!
This just convinces me Adam needs to have another show of his own.
this is it, the unofficial true final episode of mythbusters
oh my god. Bobby Fingers, Slow Mo Guys, and Adam Savage. This is the best
That does NOT look like a bird
Three people trying to calculate the goose speed with various stages of pain showing in their faces is so funny
The permanent grin despite goose-induced loss of eyeballs is…haunting
That thumbnail...I thought you were punching Weird Al with blonde hair.
I sincerely hope someone watching doesn't know who Adam Savage is and they see suddenly a guest on this show and go, wtf is this?
This is super cool, but the air cannon guy in me sees the ball valve and the tiny pipe feeding the barrel from the tank and just wonders about what it could have been
Why are you punishing an effigy of legendary drummer for Tool, Danny Carey, with a bird to the face?
Absolute GOLD collab right here!!
Didn’t look like a bird in the thumbnail 🤷🏼‍♂️
Do not get the joke. I don't even know who that guy is supposed to be.
It's just so wholesome to see you guys, after 13 years of doing videos, panels, colabs and co-ops yourself, still fan-boying for a fellow celebrity (even if they, at least online, only have a fraction of your followers; no shade). 😂
Adam's laugh is so iconic that it brought back so many memories of watching Mythbusters on Discovery Channel 😊
It feels like we've come full circle on How the Slow Mo Guys is reminiscing of the Slow mo shots on Mythbusters back in the day. Now Adam Savage is on The Slow Mo and it feels like Mythbusters all over again
I absolutely love how much Adam enjoys doing goofy stuff like this. 😂
Jeff bezos
I love the Adebisi shirt! It immediately made the Oz theme pop into my head 🤣🤣
The thumbnail is offensive, and you know why
Great seeing you guys posting again
Thank you slo mo guys, I shake with joy everytime there is a new upload
I hope gav knows that us viewers feel like we r watching mythbusters 2.0 while watching their vids
I love the respect Dan shows Adam. When Adam takes over dans usual job he backs off and even asks questions he already knows the answer to, showing that he values Adams ideas
Jeff Bezos with hair!
The "BIRD"
this video.... put a smile on my face for sooo damn long that my jaw hurts...... so much happy. Gavin and mythbuster adam together.....
12:30 Jeff Bezos took one for the team
“I brought the high speed cameras, Bobby brought the Fabio heads and geese.” Is a sentence that has got to be completely new 😂
Dunno who this Bobby fingers guy is but he's hilarious. Subbing.
that famous 3 2 1 😮
Ngl, I thought you were firing something else
Nice Slop O'Clock shirt🤣
This is like YouTube Avengers haha
Dream team
This is exactly what I needed tonight.   Thank you :)
SCIENCE!
I THOUGHT I WAS WATCHING MYTHBUSTERS CLIP??? ADAM?!?
Amazing episode
I’d like to see a camera flash when it’s in high speed sync.
that was amazing though, i personally have some sort of complex against stuff done to eyes, i always creeps me out so once the eye started to pop out i had to look away. i know it's not real but still
When you need The Slow Mo guys and Adam Savage for your project - you're officially up to some weird stuff.
Dan:”how do you aim something so long?” Bobbyfingers:”I have tons of experience with that” *pats his back* Fckng hilarious 😂
10:57 I don't know why, but the face seems so uncanny and disturbing to me.
哈哈哈哈
The dummy looks more like Weird Al than Fabio!
14:34 is the most horrifying  thing ever ngl...
FYI, that lube makes a great additive to dawn soap to make giant (like 6 foot diameter) soap bubbles.
MYTHBUSTERS WITH SLOW MO GUYS WHAAAAT? YES
#fabio
I had to like just for the absolutely golden introduction to your  experiment
Tfw you're going through someone else's phone and you find a screenshot of 13:06 without any context
"i have tons of experience with that"
I love those red pants
adam savage is the OG
we got some amazingly cursed frames of fabio this episode, thanks guys!
my favorite part is where they all do math
"It's just best if they're unconscious"...🤣🤣🤣
It looks like Jeff Bezos when the hair falls off!
Humans at their best. It's a good day. 😌
I really, really enjoy the episodes where it's you guys joining other absolute nerds, each with varied and wonderful expertise, having a great day and great banter.
Heavy Mythbusters vibes here, just missing Robert Lee narrating it
Wow, I guess anything goose on this channel, huh
Inconclusive data. Needs rigid skeletal internals.
Adam Savage is a legend. I could watch him all day, endless enthusiasm.
Glad Adam made it clear about the Lubey Goose Cannon safety precautions
Is this what dreams are made of?
"You may be thinking to yourself, why is a ballistic gel goose covered in animal birthing lube being fired out of a 20 foot air cannon?"  I wasn't thinking it was a goose.
This is high art
I think about this everyday i ride apollos chariot
Great video all .
i was just thinking the other day "you guys need to do a video with adam savage" low and behold, this video comes to existence
I knew if I just keep scrolling eventually will bump into something worth watching. Well done chaps!
Grey Foot the foolish. Quick mud like lube below that crusty surface.
16:10 best part
Amazing, great video
I thought 14:32 was the money shot, but then 14:34 was pure perfection.
So was the fight real or not?
I have never laughed so hard at you guys and your test subjects!  Keep Adam coming back!!!  ❤
I would really like this duck to go WAY faster. What if you narrow the start of the pipe. Then the bird will get stuck there and pressure will build up until it shoots out. Imagine supersonic bird smashing human face. Or just ask Destin @smartereveryday to borrow his Mk 1 Supersonic Baseball Cannon 😄
There's a joke somewhere in here about shooting geese but I'm too lazy to figure it out
Haha.... I've never laughed so much.... "The most beautiful man in the world" gets a lubed up Goose to the face.
and in true Mythbusters Fashion, it wouldn't be a video without Adam injuring himself
@12:30 Jeff Bezos.
that freeze frame at 14:34 may be the single greatest thing you've captured in slow motion!
This gives off so many MythBusters vibes I swear
Well this is a video that exists.
They should play Rise of the Valkyries as the big bird flies out the money shooter.
Ugh. Can't believe you had savage on this show. Don't like that individual. He's friends with dictators. Disgusting human being.
Why are these guys shooting giant slugs at Weird Al?
Collab with nile red
The PVC pipe needs a venturi just forward of the goose to lightly trap it and allow air pressure to build up behind the goose. This would help the goose gain a higher terminal velocity and not allow it to simply slide down the pipe with the least amount of air pressure that hits it when the valve is first opened.
14:34
I love watching the Slo-Mythbusting Guys!
Adam Savage. Oh. My. God. Everything about this video was perfect. I didn't realise how much I missed Mythbusters until I saw this. I love you all.
Just a bunch of kids having Fun.
So, was there really a fist fight or was that all staged? Secondly we need know how it happened not necessarily who won.
The crossover I never knew I needed
Birthing lube LoL!
"its hard to aim something so long" "i have total experiance with that" the look on dans face :D :D
Barefoot Gen
Love the angle at 14:09
I live for a world in which the slow mo guys and Adam have a spinoff show of mythbusters
12:53 its so beautiful
This might actually need a graphic content warning. Oooh, that was such a good shot.
why no one is talking about how the Face look just like Jeff Bezos when the hair fell off!
Funniest Slo Mo Guys video ever 😂😂😂
Gentle boy 01
YOOOOOOOO BOBBY FINGERS  the bezos boat is amazing
My favourite moment was everyone struggling to do math and looking very much in pain while doing so
i thought it was a different bird from the thumbnail
best collab ever
I just had an idea for ballistic gel, I don’t know if it’s possible though. I imagine water being poured on it, then shooting something through the water and into the ballistic gel. If it makes the usual hole, it might pull in some water.
The slo mo I never knew I needed to see. Great science.
bird shot
Alternate title: “Goose Birth at 75 mph”
14:33 xddd
this... this.. THIS BRINGS SO MUCH JOY  im crying tears of happiness...
"It's not a supersonic goose..."  I think you have all the tools to make one go supersonic :D
Fabio without the wig = Jeff Bezos
It wouod be hilarious to see Fabio react to this video.
Slow Mo chaps, how starstruck were you?
This is the greatest collaboration in history!!! What a joy!
Adam Savage 🤢🤢
the ethereal sounds of the slo mo footage are unreal
I was shookt to see adam in the video! This is just like a mythbusters mini ep
Does sag aftra hand out the same hats to every minor tv celebrity??
Who won the fights between Dan and Bobbyfingers?
I saw once this scientist using such a cannon to launch supersonic ping pong balls. And the trick was some kind of mylar plugging the end so they could generate a vacuum ahead of the projectile. So when they fired, the projectile was rushed forward with no air resistance at all and popped the mylar easily. You should try that with your goose.
I definitely feel the 4 of you could make one hell of a show, whether it be on TV or YouTube.
The last thing i ever expected today was to be able to watch a collaborative video from 3 different  content creators/channels  who i adore and make me feel like this world is worth fighting for.   Even before i watch this video, im leaving this comment.   My faith in humanity Has been strongly restored.
@6:15 😂
10:07 Me about to nail the math test 14:23 Me reading the first question 14:34 Me after the test
10:07 Me about to nail the math test 14:23 Me reading the first question 14:34 Me after the test
It's all fun and games until someone loses an eye. Then it's a new game, Find The Eyeball! :D
man adam is such an iconic person. absolute staple of my childhood. love everything about this episode. his laugh makes me so happy. like a drunk uncle during thanksgiving
This is my "Avengers" (2010)
you did a vid with adam savage?!!! hes my hero too!
I automatically download your episodes, I don’t read the descriptions most of the time. What a wonderful surprise to see Adam in this one, traditional wide brimmed hat and all.
Anyone else thinks bobby fingers sounds like jack sparrow😂
you all sit around have a few beers and someone says what if we !!!!!! ???
J-Lube FTW :D
This better not awaken anything in me...
Adam Savage is The White Morgan Freeman. Change my mind.
This. This is what the internet was made for!
As soon as i saw the thumbnail i knew the historic event from the inagural ride of apollo's chariot was going to be recreated.
Why not use a two and a half or 3 in pipe from the tank to the cannon 🤔
Dunno, this was easily one of the most boring for me
That is NOT I repeat, NOT What I thought was being shot at his face in the thumbnail
This was just like watching an episode of Myth Busters, really miss that show!
The way the flying eye turned to look at the camera was le chef's kiss!
Watching the eye pop out was disturbing
I found Bobby Fingers' channel a few months ago and it felt like I stumbled upon.. well it felt like I stumbled upon a Bobby Fingers buried treasure.
Adam Savage is a very happy cheerful guy but seeing him back in the setting of what Mythbusters was at the beginning made him seem happier than I've seen in a long time. This was amazing.
"Lube shot in 3, 2, 1!" This is gold
Now I see the bird
Pause at 14:35, send a screenshot to your crush with no comment whatsoever, thank me later
The crossover we always needed but never thought we’d get
badass!!!!!
That's not Fabio that's spencer from underoath 😂
the Fabio head without the wig looks just like Jeff Bezos lol
This felt like just some bois hanging out doing dumb stuff together, it was brilliant.  I think we all wish we could have been there 🤣
i love seeing Adam in a testing environment again!!
I love Adam! He's great!
You guys do WEIRD things 👍👍👍👍
When it eye popped out. They killed a fly
And they say you cannot have fun if you’re working?!  This guy us a legend. He should sell 2 day classes where you just hang out with him and have a blast. Such an authentic guy too. Great video. Must have felt surreal
WAIT S,SEAGULL got put on the deck... MATE put up the footage in slowmo LOL
Am I the only one who has zero clue what Fabio has to do with this??
Only Jamie Heyneman would make it just more fun out of this Masterpiece video. Thanks ♡
This video started off fairly dirty Adam.
This is so John Carpenter/Kronenberg-esque
Man everytime I watch him, I remember my chieldhood too. 🫡 legend ❤
Why shooting a bird in Danny Carey's face? 🤔
Adam is a F*cking Legend and i have Loved Mythbusters sinve i was a Kid watching them on Sky😍🥰
Great to see Adam back out in the field enjoying himself. 🤠 Oh and you guys
The Sloppy Joe's F**kface/Regulation shirt <3
"Any cows need to born here...we can help"    Adam, I love you.
Very much reminds me of the Monty Python 'slap me in the face with a wet kipper' sketch.
Duck turns into deranged dugong.
What is that thumbnail 😂😂
Thats no goose
The head 10/10 Looks like Tefue
16:10 oh my dirty mind. Please tell me what that red thing is.
I grew up with mythbusters much like Gav, and was just about in tears hearing him talk about the surreal situation, only to have him cut in Adam beating the fake duck off a pressure tank. Absolutely hysterical. This video is a treasure. ❤️
high energy people. and then you have bobby..
Not the first thing you think of when you hear Bobby Fingers and a bottle of J-lube, but what a crossover. Bravo all
As deeply imbedded as these images of Fabio are in my brain... I'm not sure that I needed to see this. Oh, I enjoyed it; enjoyed the vast pools of institutional knowledge employed here-- but... Fabio... blubbery Fabio...
The Slow Mo Guys, Adam Savage, Bobby Fingers, and a silicone head that looks like a traumatized Weird Al. What a world.
My 1 year old could not stop watching this. But also could not stop crying everytime the creepy face came on.
Adam and Gavin my two favourite personalities of all time! what a dream video!
NGL....... that thumbnail don't look like a duck.......
14:34 Here you go. Best face I've seen all week.
Next time, vacuum seal the pipe. ;)
8:30 min. They shoot the thing into the mannequin so u dont have to watch nonesense.
0:21 errrr nope that never crossed my mind 😊
So this was all to find out whether Fabio could have been hit directly in the face by a bird and come away with only the minor injuries that he did. I'd question the methodology a little - is the gel bird the same mass as a real bird? The real bird would have seen the coaster coming and probably tried to avoid it, spreading its wings and possibly only clipping Fabio with a wing tip or maybe just the tail.
Tall bear 28
8:36 Oh man, I wish his mouth was just open a little wider and a cavity behind it, he would have swallowed the whole goose.
That dummy looks like Brent from @GoobertownHobbies
Adam having fun with his job is the most satisfying thing to ever watch, I’m learning.
what a fanboy moment to be in I'm jealous
Wow what a collab, loved it!
The crossover nobody knew we needed 😂
Great one guys. So many amazing people together in one spat. Just beautiful :)
*BRILLIANT*
I got hit by a bird doing 60mph, luckily it hit my visor, felt like being hit with a hammer though.... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HWkXTkUgb0
Yes please.
Mythbusters AND The slo mo guys???? My life is complete 🥰
What a dream collab!
At some point, having watched mythbusters in my youth and slowmoguys for years, I even get that second hand feeling of "How/what/why in the world am I watching and did this video get made."   Absolutely awesome.
J Lube is the bargain bin stuff. Go for K Lube if you want the real good stuff. Same active ingredient but no fillers.
Fkn EPIC collab  LOVE it
Jeff Bezos – is that you?
12:13: Fabio 12:23: Owen Wilson
The shot that stretched Fabio's nose reminded me of someone.... 13:04
The Fabio head without hair looks like the head from Art Attack
Poor Favio.  (Someone has to say it) Because none of them did!
From the thumbnail, I though that projectile was something else...😅 then the intro is Adam jamming that lubed up thing into a hole 🤣🤣 Pause the video at 14:34 when both eyes are hanging out 😆
From the thumbnail I thought that Weird Al was involved in some way. I think it was the hair.
pushing my nostalgia buttons hard here...
After 1st goose hit i was like why am i watching this but i cant look away
📢 <<If you ride your One-wheel (skate board, etc.) goofy-foot, or do anything at all in a "left-handed" manner; please immediately report to your nearest catholic nun for corrective exorcism via wooden ruler.>> 📢 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
12:28 Turns out Jeff Bezos is Fabio without hair.
the junction of Sloppy Joe's with a former Mythbuster is an insane thing to happen
Watching this video is awful if you have a subwoofer. Full on earthquake situation. High pass filter when recording windy conditions, please! Your mic picks up more of those low frequencies than you think
Jamie Heinemann DID always say: When in Doubt, Lubricate!
OI! Bobby Fingers! Love that guy!
That music is both horrible and too loud!  (At the start mostly, it did seem to get quieter?)
So was the fight between them and Bobby faked?
Loved seeing Adam as a part of this, brought me the joy of watching countless runs of Mythbusters. Fantastic job with this fellas
Next video is Dan in a giant balloon filled with animal lube 😂
who's Fabio?
Bobby fingers needs way more eyes on what he's doing. Just spectacular and so original.
I hope Dan got a few good hits on fingers. I’m sure he needed it.
speaking as someone who tool a pheasant to the face in a convertible, how hard would a bird have to hit you in order  to lose an eye??
12:23 Weird Al turns into Dwayne the Rock Johnson in a fraction of a second
Seeing Adam doing his laugh, I felt like I was watching Mythbusters with my mama again when I was so much younger... It damn near brings a tear to my eye.
Adam  savage is amazing
"It's just best if they're unconscious" 😂
I’ve now seen Adam Savage load a greased up ballistic gel goose into a 20ft. air cannon aimed at a Wish model of Wierd-Al Yankovic’s head.  Loved every second! 😂
Please do a video of Dan in a 6ft balloon full of animal lube. 🙏
GUS!!!!
12:30. he turned into jeff bezos
Dude I’m so incredibly jealous of you meeting and testing with Adam! How awesome!
As someone who lives in a clay heavy area, I feel Adam's pain with the shoes. Also, this is the collab I'm sure many people have been waiting for for years. So cool to see Adam on a Slo Mo Guys vid.
Normal speed: nothing special. Slo Mo: OMG that's horrifying!
12:28 my name is Jeff
Love how Adam shows exactly when compressor starts at 4:15 😆
You guys do the best collabs.
not gonna lie i thought it was a D!@#$
Those of us familiar with mythbusters would never question why there's a ballistic gel goose covered in lube in anything really.  hahaha i miss that show!  I want to see a car made entirely of the rubber they use on bumper cars and see if it would help or hinder a car in a wreck or if just having it around where a car would bump you in a bumper thumper if it would help prevent damage and i think that would be a great project!
I'm Pakistani
What i got from this was that anything fits with enough lube.
I love Adam Savage!!!
I'm ssad that I almost got to meet the Mythbusters, but they were being interviewed when I saw them walk past me
Adam Savage is such a legend I swear
I love how it looks kinda anticlimactic in real time, but when you see the slow-mo, it’s absolutely carnage!
And Fabio's latest turn means he deserves a goose to the face.
.    Of all the celebrities' I know Of, I have followed Adam for literally 2/3 of my life. I was watching MythBusters at the time I discovered Calvin & Hobbs. When YT started kicking off, I discovered things like jogweels's, Is it ok to microwave this, Blendtec's Will It Blend?, The King of Random, Backyard Scientist, Cody's lab, And The Slow Mo Guys. When MythBusters came to an end, I cried, But I had these channels to fall back on.       But when Grant Thompson died in 2019, I cried. And when Grant Imahara died in 2020... I cried all over again. I still get chocked up thinking about both of them. On that note, if you know a science or engineer guy with the name Grant... DONT put them on camera.
Who doesn't love Adam Savage? The man's enthusiasm is extremely contagious
The Slo Mo Guys need to hire Adam Savage as their safety officer.
looks like a blark and son character
I always considered what you guys do art. But the thoughtful ridiculousness of this was truly a masterpiece
Did you intend the dummy to look like Danny Carey?
So fun to see Adam again..
I don’t get it. A rubber clear duck and a rubber fabio-ish head and a silly pvc potato tube. And a bunch of lube innuendo. ? Savage just isn’t that entertaining.  Come on Slo-Mo Guys, you’ve got better mascots.
Thank you for introducing me to Bobby Fingers. He is quite the funny gentleman
I swear in shots it looks like Sean Penn. 😂
What an all star lineup. Amazing. Hope there's more collab in the future!
Real nice episode! Fun day!
what a blast
Man, i love seeing Adam Savage. Hes like a kid that gets to do all the dangerous stuff he wanted to as a kid. His energy is so contagious
"... and Adam Savage assembled a 20-foot air cannon" - when, less than 90 seconds in, you know this video is going to be epic
🤔😲
I remember this story
Oh that's a ballistic gel goose?  Thank god i thought it's something elese 😂
No geese were harmed in the making if tis slow mo. Fabio's on the other hand?
Maybe he can help you get a tv show? Hope you do more together
Golden
least time-watched video in channels history?
What a awesome video with the greatest people ever thanks guys for this amazing content!!!
The look immediately after reading about keeping away from the peritoneal cavity.... Also the thumbnail looks like Weird Al in a blonde wig, getting hit in the face by a questionable sex toy.   Overall, a 20/10 episode, will watch many many times again.
This video makes me happy.
So much fun!
12:31 is that Bezos?
Fabio looks like Danny Carey.
10:07  ♫ Noooooooooo… ♫ Oooooooone's…  ♫ *Based* like Gas-ton! ♫ Has the *grace* of Gas-ton! ♫ No one takes a gel goose to the *face* like Gas-ton!  Yeah, I know; bit of a stretch, as he's not actually a prince. LOL Also I was really hurting for functional "face" rhymes. 😅
12:30 @standupmaths cameo
The greeatest crossover in history
Bobby Fingers is a LEGEND.
I remember when the "Animal birthing agent" was introduced on mythbusters. Every bit of this was a riot.
Wow. This was an impactful video for me. Just loads of fun watching a channel hook up with someone so monumental in this genre. I will be watching this one again and again. Jamie hasn't changed a bit
8 years ago I saw Adam Savage saying in a Reddit QnA that he would love to collaborate with the Slow Mo Guys. And I'm happy that it finally happened.
Am I the only one who thinks their Fabio looks like Weird Al?
Watching Mythbusters growing up actually taught me English as a second language without even taking any classes. That show unlocked an entire universe for me, I owe them a lot
7:30 I never figured Adam to be an bird hunter (or hunter of any kind for that matter) but only a hunter would know that “put a wounded bird out of its misery” technique. Always knew he was a bright fellow but kudos for him for actually going out and getting his own food himself instead of just pretending that meat magically appears in the supermarket cooler already dead and wrapped around in Saran Wrap.
14:35 i can’t with the face
YESSS ANOTHER ONE MISS YALL love yall. Makin me feel young again. gad damn what a collab!
Look! A gelduck ramming ben gravy
I watched the whole thing, end to end. That's rare. Well done, lads.
This all seemed so fake and painful.
I’m so not ok with most of these slo mo shots… it’s awesome!
Дети . . . 😃🤗🤪
This is unbelievable disturbing
If only they made the birds pink
This is my favourite colab you guys have ever done! Please please please do more videos together!
We now need a video of Fabio reacting to this video.
Just gav and dan casually living every curious millennials dreams
Excuse me everyone for my language but I have to say F_(# Yeah! This is awesome, having two of my favorite channels coming together because of a channel I as of this moment am subscribed to and having a great time filming for not just our pleasure but Thiers too. Thank you Gentlemen. Thank you.
Physics are fun! Or is it more properly: Physics is fun!
I am just excited to know that Bobby Fingers is working on a new video.  Life is good!
That face is frightening.
14:09 Wow. That's one of the clearest, most amazingly focused shots I've seen!
Fabio took it like a champ..."Im just glad it didnt hit any of the girls....it really could have hurt them" He meant that...he was worried about the Ladies😊
Best video to date.
Adam’s laugh is beautiful, contagious, and nostalgic all at once.
You may be thinking to yourself "Why is a ballistic gel goose, covered in animal birthing lube, being fired out of a 20ft air cannon?" ~ No, we're really not. After all these years, we're just going with it. You have, over the course of many videos, successfully recalibrated our definition of weird. A lubed up gel goose being fired into a silicon head; that's just Thursday.
Great collaboration
Gavin Free and Adam Savage is such an awesome combo
This is the most famous thing that Fabio has done in his life. And Adam breathes extra life and awesomeness into everything he takes part in.
Will Smith face slap next. Obviously...
When did bezos get nice hair? Oh it’s a wig
Absolute dream team
This is the greatest collaboration EVER!
This was a historical moment and needs to be made as a diorama
Adam Savage is a man who can make stuff happen. He's done a whole lot and witnessed even more. Never miss a chance to hang out with him. 👍 He's really packed full of knowledge 📖
Imagine that bird something else
The object in the thumbnail.....looks interesting....
8:53 <— thank me later
I am here just to say that the guy in the thumbnail get hit with looks nothing like a bird....it's look something else...
I gotta say as a hobbyist content creator, hearing that song at the start of the video which I have used in my own videos before is an interesting experience. Let me guess... you sorted by length, fiddled around a bit and found "A Mystical Experience - Unicorn Heads"
Suggestion - 3 different types of cars, three different sets of tires, one giant pothole.
This was great, but I think we all wanna know what happens when bones get involved.
The Mechanical Coupling Between the Bird and the Face put it on a tshirt
I'd like to vote the next edition of the OED leaves a link to this video next to the word "collaboration". 👌👏
a collab I didn't think I needed, but in reality I did
Looks like an Aphex Twin album cover
Adam has no idea how to lube a large object into a tiny hole.
Bobby Fingers brought me here. I really hope Fabio makes a reaction video to all of these.
Great to see Adam on your channel, love the slow mo!
The kid in me wants Myth Busters 2.0 but I know that is not likely on any horizon except another universe out there somewhere..
You guys have no idea how jealous of you I am right now 😂
Hey, you (Mr. Savage) use Dr. Sholl's!  I do too!  Great to know not so great minds think alike... ooof, yea rotten minds right?  XD  just kidding.  We all know he's one of the more brilliant people out there :) .
I’m filing this under DIY.
Don't forget the high pass audio filter when editing please, the windy shots are about to blow my subs to the moon.  Love the content.  ;)
8:12 if you wan to save a bit of time
Awesome video, would love to see the Jamie, Kari and Tori as well!
So many duplicate comments in here. You guys are greasing the algorithm like a goose in an air cannon. Is that what you and Bobby fought over?
lmfao i saw that mel gibson model the day it was posted
I think you just created a new meme template
A rubberbandit, the slowmo guys, and adam savage isn't a mashup I thought I needed, but it has been a welcome one!
Yeah that doesn't really look like a goose... just saying 😅
Absolutely my life is complete now with this collab. 😍😍😍 OMG
I know that you know that they know that I know.... that don't look like no dang bird in that thumbnail.
That weird looking dil....shut your lips😂😂😂
Adam is THE consummate professional! He always seems so slapdash in his own workshop but seeing him in the field is really special!
This is like a nerd Avengers group and I love it!
Am i going crazy or does Bobby sound EXACTLY like Ray Romano?
gotta say Dan is looking in great shape!
You would think someone who was in Hollywood for decades would become sort of a prima-donna but Adam is never afraid to get dirty! That why I’ve always loved mythbusters and Adam!
14:35  hilarious face. Warm wishes from Minnesota! ❤️❤️❤️
Shout out to U-Haul for the 26 foot van.
Ok … I’ve watched the other two videos…. But this one is hilarious when I see the thumbnail…   SLOMOGUYS… you searched long and hard to find just the right frame…. BECAUSE that doesn’t look like a “Goose”
It's official, this is the greatest video on the internet
I feel like they could’ve done something cooler for Adam Savage
Adam firing a phallic object out of a cannon with gavin is something I didn't know I needed to see
This is the best video I’ve seen for a long time, it just felt like an old mythbusters episode. Love it
For a good time, go frame-by-frame (comma and period keys on desktop) through 14:34
WILD cold open
This was either a really bad or really good time for the edible to kick in.
This the literal representation of a William Gibson quote from his book Pattern Recognition. “He took a duck to the face at 250 knots”. If you’re a geek, and a sci-fi nerd, I hope you find this as rad, and funny as i did😊
Anyone else think during the one where he lost his hair, he looked like a buff Bezos?
We know fabio can take a punch😂
The MythBusters nostalgia is strong with this one.
Yeah.  Love your videos, but this cannon was lame
In the history of humanity, how many people have gotten the chance to utter the words, "fire this test Goose"?
Why would they do this to you 😢 @GoobertownHobbies
I feel inexplicably annoyed at any comment here which doesn't mention Bobby Fingers, who I firmly believe is one of the greatest YouTubers of all time and deserves to have infinitely more subscribers than he currently does. And I'm saying this as a fan of Adam Savage since episode 1 of Mythbusters.   Let's put it this way, Adam made a whole Tested video because he was so excited to tell everyone about Bobby Fingers. I'd have done the same, but instead I just have to keep repeatedly telling friends and family until they inevitably watch one of his videos and join me in telling everyone else how amazing his channel is 😆  If you're one of the ~500,000 people who've only seen this video and haven't watched Bobby's yet, you need to fix that ASAP. Trust me, you won't regret it.
Could barely recognize Dan without his absolute unit of a labcoat
Ultimate collab!
Oh thats what that was😂
14:03 all the guys on Dec 1st
imagine how many old mythbusters episodes would have been so much better in ultra slo mo
Delightfully stupid!
Next project: Keg of beer falling upside down on something to push the ball valve so it’ll take off like a rocket.
i love seeing adam again lol
Why does that Fabio head make me think of the time Jason Sensation dressed up as Owen Hart the night Degeneration X was making fun of the Nation of Domination??
"I lost the bird" That was a very Mythbusters things to say, and I'm glad Adam said it.
grew up in northern arizona which is nothing but clay walking around outside after a rain you'd get 4 to 5 inches taller and if you wanted to dig even a shallow pit you needed a pickaxe
I’ve always felt like Slo Mo Guys is the spiritual successor to Mythbusters. I really hope yall keep collaborating!
Adam Savage is the goat 🐐
Silicon? Element 14? Does not look like it. Looks like silicone to me.
Great video!
Need to rename what you perverts were really thinking, “shooting rubber wangs into mouth”
This is so awesome.
Keep up the cool videos and amazing guests
I need the t shirt bobby fingers has on ! please tell me where to get it
Ok, as far as I'm concerned Adam Savage is the newest Slow Mo Guy!
First 5 seconds, the power of lubrication
This is the collab of the century!
That Lube is probably CMC or carboxy methyl cellulose. It has some weird flow properties. We used it to calculate fluid flow (Navier Stokes type transport). If I remember right it's a nonlinear so the faster the flow velocity the lower pipe drag. Harder you pump it the better it flows 😉
That’s a weird looking bird
PROOF!! You'll poke your eye out, kid!!
Come on, add Adam Savage to the team, that would be incredible
Man I miss myth busters. I would have never followed your channel without that in my past.
I never realised just how much I missed mythbusters until this point. This is one of THE BEST collabs I've ever seen
Okay guys i got something good for you! When fabio gets hit in the side of the face it makes him look like  Lord Farquaad from Shrek.
The collaboration we all wanted.
6:11 LMAOOOOOOOO
I can't believe its not bird blood!
Now that's one slick chicken
I went down the link rabbit hole and discovered so much excellent content. Thank you!
This is what makes the internet great.
The added for Less intensity
adam laugh never gets old
I read it as adam driver and got suuuuuuper excited lmao
That must have been amazing hanging out with Adam Savage!!
As a canadian all im seeing is the chicken cannon from this hour has 22 minutes XD
damn i miss mythbusters
That 1” deadman valve doesn’t give the best flow.  Need to use a 2” sealco.
I expected a "Quack damn you!"
The weird part is the Fabio head expression doesn’t change!!
Seeing J-Lube, and wondering who knows and who doesn't.
With Tom Sachs General Purpose Shoes!?!?
i JUST CAME HERE TO SAY THAT AIN'T A BIRD IN THE THUMBNAIL
That screen grab does not look like a bird is hitting a man in the face.
You'll goose your eye out!
There are some amazing freeze-frame walleyed Fabio faces around 14:34. 😅
I was literally thinking last week that they needed to have a Collab with Adam
Adam Savage, Bobby Fingers, Slo-Mo Guys, and a giant air cannon? That's what I call a party.
15:29 That’s just how dirt is out here. It’s called black gumbo and it’s the reason all the roads are bumpy and old houses lean to one side. Practical Engineering mentions it on one of his videos about soil.
I wonder what sort of collaboration they could come up with if Gav, Dan, Adam and the How Ridiculous guys got together.
A bird hit my helmet riding my motorcycle on the freeway a few years ago; all I saw was feathers and mist. Wear helmets kids.
What are you doing step-air cannon???
Mad respect to Gavin for repping what's perhaps his greatest achievement, making the pilgrimage to Sloppy Joe's
I have to say the 1st 15 seconds are just wrong lmao
No mention of the fly that landed above the eye just before impact?
I can’t be the only one that thought what I thought when I first saw that thumbnail right?
ADAM!!!!! I love you guys so much more for working with him! Such a major part Of my life. Since day one of mythbusters. Seeing you guys come together was overdue. You guys aren’t really far off from him.
My brother, a welder, calls the mud that Adam Savage is talking about at 15:30 "taller mud" because you get taller the longer you walk in it.
14:35 quite a thumbnail image there
That one time Weird Al got a super saiyan stunt double
Adam is the best. Good job guys
the head without the wig is Jeff Bezos 🤣
We need a side by side of fabio with a face full of goose and vintage Dan with a face full of soccer ball as a comparison. Because science. 😎
Gives new meaning to the phrase "Bro ate that."
It is a weapon when you "arm" it so I guess normal firearms safety applies.
the freeze frame at 14:35 is hilarious
So uh… what was this for?
Doesn't look like a bird.
I'm glad that for this shoot they got Adam Savage, pneumatic bird launching expert.
I'm so happy this exists😊
this is the greatest collaboration of our time
Slow mo guys AND adam savage in one video? i can hardly contain my excitement.
It's really refreshing to see you guys giving smaller creators here on YouTube a spotlight on your channel.
What caused the fight ?
Not them discussing at some point a literal version of, “Do you ever wonder why we’re here?” Lol
Clearly, that isn't Fabio -- it's Jeff Bezos with a wig on! 🤣
Okay... Fabio I recognized easily, since I was alive when that happened... but "goose" was not even in the top three nouns my brain was grabbing from that thumbnail
Say what you want about him, but through the whole process, Fabio NEVER lost his positive mental attitude
This is by far thee funniest episode to date.
Ballistic bird vs plane windshield
So cool seeing Gav and Dan team up with Adam. And it felt sooooooooo good to hear Adam counting down again.
Y'all need Mark Rober's measuring sheet he uses to get the speed of anything with a camera
As soon as that powdered lube bottle was shown, I instantly recognized it as J-lube. And I went "Oh no, that's way too much" when they dumped it into the bucket. A few teaspoons of that stuff will turn a quart of water into super thick goop. And the entire bottle is enough to make  like 20-40 gallons of lube.
All time hero of everyone 😅
6:09 it was funny seeing everyone do the math everyone had a unique face
The Buster of Myths himself!!!
This was beautiful. Thank you.
Dan, do not undersell yourself. You are the foremost expert at aiming things at other things, that typically are not aimed at things.
THEY BROUGHT BACK THE BIRD CANNON
I think we need Scott and some guns, along with Adam!! Haha such a blast from the past, Mythbusters will always hold a special place in my heart😌Always great to see Adam!(and he doesn’t have to worry about censoring himself😂)
Probably the most bleeps you will hear in a slow mo video 😂
YouTube is so back
Onward and upward, brothers
Bald Fabio is Jeff Bezos high on crack
Mythbusters - “ballistic goose covered in animal birthing goo” is just another day at the office, but “about to take the goose to the grid” is that a euphemism for something?
Surely @BobbyFingers needs to do a diorama of the ‘Will Smith slaps Chris Rock’ moment
I wish adam savage was my dad
Myth busters 2.0 👌🏻💯❤️
So did Dan and Bobby actually brawl it out in the lot
I mean, immediate like. No question.
I’d do anything for a day with Adam Savage 😭😭
BRO BOBBY FINGERS
How the hell did Bobby and Dan get in a fight? It's stupidly hilarious!
Turned Fabio into Jeff Bezos near the end there
Dang Adam is still fit for 56 🤔 I wonder how the hynamen is holding up.
This is the crossover episode I didn't know I needed!
Who is that in the background wearing an insulated hooded jacket while the rest of you are in t-shirts?  That was pretty funny.
omg I thought bobby fingers' voice was an act, but he actually sounds like that all the time, which is even more awesome
Couldn't stop smiling from start to finish, what 'A Savage' video you all created.😂
“He took a duck in the face at 250 knots.” ― William Gibson, Pattern Recognition
I'm not sure, but I think this might qualify as the best video on the Internet.
Angry birds ft fabio 🤣🤣🤣
Would like this not to be the last collab between SlowMoGuys and Adam Savage. Grew up on Mythbusters.
I've seen some pretty good Youtube collabs, but this has to be the pinnacle of them all. It's all down-hill from here.
My favourite part if all of this is how much Adam geeks out over working with you guys.
Filling up the "lube tube", huh?
I have recently been rewatching all of mythbusters so  im LOVING this collab 🤩 more please ❤
It doesn't look like a bird in the thumbnail 😂😂
14:24 is a late night commercial bump on [adult swim]
This is like a dream team for this type of content.  You have a true artist, a true builder, and a true cinematographer.  Like all of these guys are experts in their craft in the weirdest way.
I can't believe it's not butter!
needed to fire this thing on max
Bro I was tearing up for you. Y'all gotta be so proud to do this episode with Adam
Can you imagine fabio sees this, 15 minutes of his head being smacked in the face with gel geese
Lame !!!! So was myth busters . Sorry. Imagine what was possible that you didn’t try.  Sad
7:29 “it’s just better if they’re unconscious.”  Never change, Adam 🤣🤣🤣
Dan better be taking a bath in animal lube for the giant water balloon video in June this year
Adam Savage sure has come a long way from Chicken Cannon.
New pfp just dropped
Adam saying "lube" as opposed to "lubricant" feels all kinds of wrong.. yet so right!
I bet your going to lube the tip
11:14 - The Dreamworks Face!
new funniest word conjunction: "lubed goose"
Born to fly.
So pleased to see Adam Savage with you boys
I hope The SlowMo Guys and Adam get a chance to collaborate more! This was something special.
Love it
I'm sorry a goose covered in what
I'm 1:30 in and It's HAPPENING!
holy wind noise batman! my subwoofer is going crazy
Love it when my favorite  worlds collide, so much fun
I seen this man’s bungus pipe I can’t unsee that
That moment that Dan realizes that he could have been using lube for a decade of balloon videos is quietly one of the best moments on this channel comprised of mostly amazing moments.
Does anyone else think it looks like a d1ld0?
y'all are AWESOOOOME!!!!!!!!!
Why does Fabio without hair look like Jeff Bezo's?
You guys really nailed it with the mood here. Best editing style yet.
I had to comment as this video began. Bass Tournament, Columbia River, Richland Washington. Bass pro is flying down river and hits a bird. For a while there were guys with motorcycle helmets in the area because of the fear. I think dude finished the tourney with a big ass bandage on his head and face.
Now we need a video of Fabio reacting to this video.
"Quick- we need a 5 gallon bucket of lube, an air cannon, and a ballistics gelatin goose! Who are we gonna call?" Only 1 name comes to mind honestly...
Powdered hagfish excretion in a bottle… nice.
I'm starting to think Fabio is telling the truth
Responsibly irresponsible.
That last shot had a somewhat phallic looking projectile.
Why why give it face.. Dude.
Wow! That was a bunch of my favorite goofballs doing what they do best! Laughing!!
Reminded me of my first long distance motorbike trip.   🤣🇦🇺
adam is a savage that he walks in wet shoes
"The mechanical coupling of the bird and the face"
The Slow Mo Guys, Adam Savage, Bobby Fingers, and a silicone head that looks like a traumatized Weird Al. What a world we live in.
I cannot remember the last time I laughed this much. Thanks so much for making this!
I felt nothing but pure joy for 16 minutes and 30 seconds. PLEASE collab with Adam Savage again.
No imagine a cellphone flying off a coaster and hitting someone. People have got broken noses because someone wouldn't put their phone away.
14:33 why r not enough people talking about that FACE HAHAHA
Mythbusters was the biggest reason I loved science in school. They made it look so fun and cool lol
regulation commenter here 0/ amazing  shirt
You almost lost me with Adam Savage in the intro. Usually he's comparing the best Phillips screw drivers to each other or going to a Furry convention.
This is really funny should try a 2-inch ball valve and 250 psi
I had a fever dream exactly like this, once.
This felt like an episode of mythbusters in all the right ways. Oh I hope there are more collabs like this. This is truly magical.
I think this is absolutely amazing. I needed this mash up.
I can't believe the nostalgia i have for just hearing Adam shout out 3, 2, 1!
Wtf was the red thing flying through the frame at the end??
A couple of tips for the team if they want to reach higher speed with that air cannon. 1 Trim the barrel shorter. Due to the flow restriction into the barrel, the intial velocity in the barrel will build up a pressure wave in front of the goose, and the void behind the goose will reduce the pressure behind the goose in a fairly short distance. The speed profile on a launch can be recorded by launching a small magnet inside the goose and placing sensing coils at a regular interval along the barrel. I used 1 foot spacing and started with a 2 inch valve, and a 10 foot barrel. Velocity peaked and dropped off well before 10 feet. An overly long barrel does not equate to longer acceleration distance with constant acceleration. With a valve much smaller than 2 inch in that cannon with that diameter barrel, the acceleration is complete in well under 5 feet. To clock the magnet launches, used an oscilloscope to capture the classic S curve of the magnet passing. Center of the coil is in the middle of the S where the magnet is not approaching or leaving a coil. Measure the time from one crossing to the next to get the time to travel 1 foot. Directly converts to mS per Foot, which inverted is Feet/Second. Did this project as part of an engineering challenge. It was the method used to find the optimum barrel trim for a pressure and projectile.
Doesn't look like a bird in the thumbnail
Wow! We need to see this collaboration more often. This brings back Mythbusters memories which is by far my favorite show ever!  More Adam and Slo Mo guys... please!!!
Birb 🦢
Nice 👍
This is just the greatest collab
That’s a small goose! Or maybe they always just seem bigger because of their feathers
Mythbusters 2004 combined with Slow Mo Guys 2024 is the best show in a long time, possibly in the history of television.  ‘Make it so’
This is a crossover I had no idea the world needed.
That dummy looks like Danny Carry.
4:01 Old engineering adage: Get it going fast enough; It'll fit.
14:34
This is the best cross-over i never knew i needed
14:34 the face I make when I...
This is just wonderful all the way round
It’s been 25 years since that happened? I lived near Busch Gardens so it was on the news there, that’s the only reason I know about it
Shocked Adam is only 56
Absolutely phenomenal. Would love to see more with Adam Savage
That thumbnail 💀💀💀
That shot right there at 14:35 with the eyes in the process of coming out! Wow!  What a bizarre video idea, turned out awesomely!
So awesome to see ya hang out with one of your inspirations, Gav!
On a serious note, Tha k you so very much for showing Adam's safety briefing before starting the actual firing process. This is widely ignored by smaller creators trying to get their channels and careers started with potentially dangerous content.
"Cover your duck in lube"
I had a sparrow hit me on the shoulder while ridding my motorcycle at 45 MPH.   I can assure you that a hit like you are simulating would break a person's neck.
Adam Savage! Love this brilliant dude!  Been a huge fan since Mythbusters!
*that goose looks really sus in the thumbnail*
That did not look like a duck on the thumb nail
That is not a goose
Omg that was AWESOME!!! I wish I could’ve been there in person! I’m a long time fine of the slow mo guys and I’ve been watching mythbusters since forever!! And I live 20 minutes from there!! Love the videos guys!!!!!!!
If cops pulled them over amd saw who were together... they're definitely getting searched. He knows something is about to get blown up or smashed.
how many times have i Heard "did you just nail that!?" on this channel???
"And it uses the cow juice?" lol gross
That wasn't my first question.. but I loved myth busters so I'll give a like. #riprt
The resemblance of the model to the actual Fabio is amazing.
36 seconds in and I can't be the only person that thinks that's Fabio.... ROFL
I genuinely thought this was a Weird Al music video from the thumbnail, lol
ADAM AND BOBBY AND SLOMO GUYS!?!
Slow Mo-th Busters!  I'd love to see this with a see through barrel.
Congrats! You are the new Myth Busters!
it made me so happy to see this collab. there is a lot of mythbusters dna in the slow mo guys. having adam on here brings everything full circle.
I could watch a 100 episodes with you guys and Adam, like this literally needs to be its own series.
this is a legendary moment caught on film
12:30  Oh hi Jeff
12:29 suddenly.... Jeff Bezos
gotta love gavin reppin sloppy joes
Absolutely not the crossover I expected in 2024 but GODDAMN am I happy about it.
everyone in this video is living their best life. good stuff guys and congrats on hanging out with adam
FISH CANNON!!!
I'm so glad Adam savage was there. Now I know I can trust the science.
Such a strange concept for a video but it is perfection.
This was just guys being boys
new MythBusters cast ?
It's all fun and games until someone looses an eye.
What a wholesome guy <3
Gavin and Adam working together is the greatest thing in the world
Finally we have Adam on here. He once said slow mo is some of the most beautiful photography. This is a match made in heaven.
Legends
I needed this video today just like I need more in the future; a lot.  An ongoing collaboration with Tested would be well worth watching. Hope it happens.
Adam savage trying to be a bossy, insurance puss.
you got to film with adam savage   what in the hell, guys
We all needed this
Adam Savage, Bobby Fingers, AND the Slow Mo Guys in one video?!??!!  My world is complete.  Lower the curtain.
shout out to that sloppy joes shirt!
Lol hilarious!
1 Like on this comment = 10 Pushups , I'm trynna get ripped 💪
Quote: "I tell you, it was a miracle. I know that. For a goose, for anything hit you almost at like, 80 miles an hour, and, to leave you with just a stitch, I'm telling you, it was a freaking miracle. And because of that day, I began living life to its fullest. I could have died. I could have lost my vision. But I only got a cut."
Great start, "animal-birthing lube"
You guys got Adam Savage on your show.. I'm crying right now
Cronenbirb
That insanely optimistic visage, even after the blows, seeming to call out, "No, it's all right.  I think I even like it a bit!"  Sheer slapstick!
Bikers of Florida be warned ⚠️ 😊
Me when: .....
This Adam Savage guy is going to be big.  So nice to give his channel a shout-out.
Adam says grease this bird and i got major Mythbusters flashbacks.
Between joining forces with How Ridiculous, and NOW with Adam Savage, I think my Slow Mo Guys bucket list is practically complete! ❤
INTRO WAS MONEY 😂
And a great day was had by all
10:51 kinda looks like the album cover to facelift by AiC
Supersonic Goose is a good name for a band
16:10 I feel less bad about my initial thoughts on the title card. I was kinda sad you guys played innocent. Until the very end ;)
Royal Canadian Air Farce Chicken Cannon
Something quite special about Gavin gushing about fulfilment over footage of Adam abusing a ballistic gel goose XD
Absolute dream collab
I thought this was the stupidest slow mo ever until I saw the nose distort and snap back. And the teeth. And the grinning face.
That is a duck Not a goose
In real life would this be like goose kamekazi
15MAY2024 - Yeah. I had one of those moments. Early 90s. Forward torpedo room of an old nuke boomer. How the *%^$ did I get here?
That head has a striking resemblance to Matt from Stand Up Maths
Adam’s laugh is as intoxicating as ever. Just makes you want to smile.
Damn was a treat to see Adam savage and slowmo guys together
I'm sure they were sure they could but never stopped to ask if they should.
Black mother 58
For us non-Americans, 75 mph equals 120 kph.
That thumbnail looks like something else honestly...
You need to do power tools
So excited for you :)
Adam Savage and the slow mo guys are the best duo... trio... thing EVER.
I wonder if adam realizes what he did for so many kids on Mythbusters. He is what Bill Nye wishes he could be like.
Skip to 12:14 and save 12 minutes of your life.
Best collab ever 🙌🏼
"no one asked us to do this..." Lmao
Dan might be the world’s leading expert in giant balloon shenanigans
The collaboration that the internet needed.
Slo Mo Guys and Adam Savage?     My dreams have come true!!!!!!
I have no words.  Mostly ‘cause I stated squealing with glee that this was a team-up with absolute legend Adam Savage, and then every additional detail just made everything exponentially better.  And *then* the dang bird got launched and I was laughing way too hard to say anything coherent.  Amazing.  Poetry in motion.  Absolutely fantastic. xD
I think Adam Savage should permanently join the Slow Mo Guys Channel
Adam Savage sinking into the ground as he picks up the goose is a moment I will never forget.
How was 14:35 NOT the thumbnail
Coooollll  Adam Savage is so awesome!!! More content with him would be so great!! Reminds me of the good old mythbusters days!
This is without a doubt, the most important video on YouTube!!
That thing is a “Dil-duck” lol.
All the channels i watch are merging.
We all thought the bird was something else, let's be honest.
The Ego on Adam...
great video ,nice seeing Adam savage and the slow  mo guys together; 2 of my childhood shows.
literally my biggest fear!  Bugger comes and just impales you
AW ADAM Savage what a legend. Love that guy. 5:43
Love you all.
14:34 has got to be one of the funniest things ive seen in a long time Just pause the video and appreciate it
"How did he die?" "Erm, well - it's a bit unusual"...
Oh man Gavin and Adam together? All we need is a cement truck now
This is the worst angry birds game I’ve ever seen. The birds don’t even look real.
It just goes to show, none of us are as dumb as all of us.
Oh my gods, collab of the century 0.0
This feels like one of those moments the Internet was made for.
really hoping gav had to explain the sloppy joes shirt to adam
Like watching a tully monster attack its prey
Awesome
This was the team up I needed and deserved. Thank you for making my day!
Love seeing this squad together
Nice touch using a Logan Paul like head for testing
Should have used gavs face for this one
Oh, 60fps . How come?
I'm only a minute or so in, but this seems like a Danless video. :(  Here's hoping for a cameo from ol' Dan to take the honkin' goose (SAFELY) like a champ! (Or, I dunno, to shoot it, or something.) EDIT: OH THERE'S DAN, WHEW, THANK GOOSE
I still don't understand how this is the same Gavin
'Luv you guys!
12:30 Jeff Bezos
That shot at 14:34 is nuts 😂
I’m gonna be honest with you that does not look like a bird in the thumbnail
I have a small pienis but no one will see that comment
I like the SLOPPY JOE'S Tee shirt from Key West.....
…So did he actually get in a fight and make you send him the footage by using sensitive documents?! Or was that just a bit?
8:38 tell me I'm not the only one who almost asphyxiated in this moment
12:29 Fabio to Jeff Bezos
There is SO MUCH more happening than what we see in 'real time' when the goose hits the head. I mean, it just looks like, whoosh, bonk, wobble, stop. Slow-mo is just so amazing to be able to catch all the action it does!
now a real goose!
You could have added two cuts to make wings on the bird for perfect smashing, but I've enjoied it a lot the same 😂❤
I like how the thumbnail doesn’t at all look like a bird, but it does look like one thing hahaha
14:35 HEY YOU GUUUUYYS!!
Only men would go out into a quarry in texas and shoot lubbed up gel birds out of an absurdly long air cannon. And theses are the perfect men to do it.
Here's a bit of this that i love: seeing Adam do his safety brief. Having watch Gav & Dan for years, i know that they cover things really well right up to the last. I wonder if they learned anything from Adam in those regards or in the conversations leading to this.
I see you guys in the same shot, and my mind keeps telling me it must be some bad photoshop instead of y'all actually right next to each other.
"Breach loading system" following cow birthing comment and there were NO CHUCKLES?!?! Dad joke fail.
Why do i feel when Adam Savage looks at Dan he thinks of all the things he can do with a military trained explosives engineer?
Just right now, it's a perfect world. This might as well have been Alameda Sheriff's Firing Range 20 years ago. I couldn't help laughing at the absurdity. Blowing Fabio's wig off was the icing on the cake. I've not heard of Bobby Fingers until now, but I am definitely going to learn more. Yeah, it's raining here in Brisbane. It's a perfect world this morning.
The Adebisi shirt makes a great video even greater.
Nice shirt Gav! Always used to go there with the boys when I used to live in Key West.
did Dan and Bobby really get into a fight?
Adam's and Gavi's laughs are always infectious. I've met Adam and Linus, just need to close that last 1 degree of Kevin Bacon and meet Gavin.
Felt like I was watching a mini Mythbusters episode here.
Love that pure Irish accent Bobby Fingers has
Sooo many er nurses collecively said: "no" when he said he lost the bird
Please don’t show the masses powdered lube
This is something special.
Who knew that the shape of a flying creature was aerodynamic?
That slow-down with the silicone goose exiting the barrel called in for that “INCOMING!!!!” yell.
Adam Savage?! WOW you guys have come far from jumping on water balloons in your back yard! I remember when Fabio took the inaugural ride on Apollo's Chariot and tanked a goose to face - came back from the ride bloody and proclaiming the ride was unsafe. It is my favorite coaster at Busch Gardens (or any theme park) to this day.
Remember when Adam pureed his lip with a vacuum cleaner motor. My favorite episode of mythbusters
Saw title, screamed FABIO!!!! 🤣🤣 that has to be one of my favorite incidents ever
Adam Savage and the Slow Mo Guys is just the best pairing that I'd never thought of.
Unsettling.
all i see is the squid gun from despicable me
Watching Fabio’s expressions on his face change as he is hit is amazing and then still goofy smiling at the end makes it even better 😂
This got golden era Top Gear level laughing out of if me
That didn’t look like a goose going the face. Just sayin
Thanks
@TheSlowMoGuys @AdamSavage @BobbyFingers Gentlemen, this was at the same time wonderfully amusing, greatly fascinating and deeply disturbing! Well done indeed! More please!!
Collab of the century 😂
I'm always astounded how little slow mo footage is in these videos
Caught on film, Adam Savage calling Gav and Dan geniuses
“And then Adam wanted to see how far it would go” I mean that’s what you gotta do. You have the stuff, you have all the guys, it’s time to just see what silliness you can get up to after the main event is complete
Decades of research and development by some of the world's most talented computer scientists and engineers. Billions of dollars in hardware and software infrastructure. The result: "Hey, guys, let's shoot fake birds at a fake Fabio!" I love the Internet!
14:35 best frame of the video
Didnt expect to see Adam Savage greasing a bird on camera.
The crossover I NEVER expected
this video felt like watching a MythBusters episode, more please.
To see Adam alongside Bobby and you fellas is just amazing. Was geeking out a little seeing all the chaos going on :)
This is definitely one of those videos I'd love to watch a few hour's worth of b-roll on, because I feel like that entire day was just non-stop laughter.
This basically felt like slipping into a mythbusters slow mo guys portal
It's like Adam Savage was always a member of the channel, and he just happened to be absent from the other videos. He fits in perfectly
I loved that you leave Adam's security measures in the final cut
Respect :-) the video was OK the human factor was 6900%
I mean...it would be more accurate to film a piece of a video camera hitting a replica of Fabio in the face at more like 43 mph, but this was much more entertaining!  "Actually, the bird hit the camera, and a piece of the metal of the camera flew and cut the bridge of [my] nose. And that was a miracle. But...they were afraid of me suing Budweiser, and so they blamed it on a bird. But actually the bird hit the camera. The bird never hit my face...I was very fortunate, very lucky because I needed one stitch."  - Fabio Lanzoni 2021
Not gonna lie, when I first saw the thumbnail, I thought that was Weird Al getting hit in the face lol. I had to stop and take a better look LOL!
The expressions on Fabio's face are going to haunt my dreams.
You specified multiple times in the video that the face is supposed to be Fabio.  ...But I can't help but see Weird Al in a blonde wig.
came for the bird, stayed for the savage.
Wonderful! Science!
Demolition Dan
That opening shot of Adam putting the lubed bird in the pipe is absolutely *hysterical*
14:29 fabulous eye tracking movement still, almost like a real eye^^
I don't think you could've picked a better thumbnail
When the wig came off, it looked like Brendan Fraser 😂
it's goa'uld larva....change my mind
I can imagine how much you must've enjoyed the time with Adam. I wish we could watch the moment you two guys met him!  What about taking Dan as the target next time? He has lots of experience with being hit in the face... That's a joke obviously, because being hit by such an air cannon must be harsh as f***! ;)
Absolutely love the collab! Would love to see more of the Tested and Adam in the future!  All around love everyone's energy in this video, honestly had me smiling all the way through
I wish they had been allowed to swear on myth busters. Adam is even more fun to watch when he's not censoring himself.
Great video as always and tell Gus that my friends and I are glad Tales From The Stinky Dragon can continue the campaign with him as the DM
Adam Savage makes everything 1000x better. No matter what.
I kind of want to see a diorama of adam savage and the slow mo guys all on their phones doing math next to a giant cannon haha
Looks like you made a breech-load shotgun with Bird Shot loaded.
I got a Six Flags ad before the video.
i love when they're trying to calculate the mph and it's just this segment of "watching a bunch of physics nerds do math"
U could feel his mythbusters (not the kid version) persona getting revived. Miss it sometimes
Its like the Avengers of weird engineering and artistic endeavors.  Also, im disappointed theres no "Squack" bird sound effects during the slowmo shots.
I'm here for fight footage, mate.
Who’s gonna say it?
Every single time I've seen Adam Savage, he looked like he hadn't aged at all since Mythbusters. This is the first time I've seen him without his sunglasses, and yeah he's definitely aged a bit.
This is the crossover episode(s) I've been waiting for.
Absolutely hilarious
Finely a Mythbuster is working with The Slow Mo Guys!
As I keep saying, the v makes the p...
"The mechanic coupling between the bird and the face." I'm glad adam never lost his humour
Henry Winkler is innocent
Fabio turned into Jeff Spicoli when he lost the eye 😂
5:50 nerds doing math. love it.
Please guys, pretty please, do not use any music while you or any one else is talking.  It is very distracting. This includes during your camera reviews. thx.
You guys are awesome….more!!!!
Mythbusters built some awesome stuff, but air cannons are one thing they always got 'wrong'. There was always a tendency for them to stick a ludicrously long barrel in front of a valve which was either too small, or too slow to be effective. It works, but it gives much worse performance than you'd expect.  Kind of funny to see the exact same issues a decade later.
"If a train leaves the station at 3pm and is travelling at 74mph ...." is what their first speed measurement looked like with them all staring at the phones.
World's Colliding!
I watched as a guy was knocked almost clear off his motorbike after hitting a seagull at Phillip Island, the bird came-off second best but the rider had to cut the lap short and park the bike, his l/hand arm and torso were bruised so badly we thought he`d broken a few bones, it happens because the track sits on the coastline of the Island..
Fabio vs. the goose??!? wow that's a call back
@bobbyfingers should make a diorama of himself making a diorama of himself making a diorama of himself...
I feel like a proud mom right now. So happy for you Gavin
im not really following what the point of this was
That thumbnail is insane
just glorious seeing this collab -
Seeing Adam back in a quarry, assembling some lethal monstrosity, is a real Onewheel ride down Memory Lane.
16:20 to 16:30, one way to take out a fly on the eye. lol
I know if Dan was targeting, it would go right into the mouth every time
Legends
that’s so funny literally my comment on the previous video was “Mythbusters the next generation” and now you have Adam on. this was hilarious
i think the best combo of cleberties to any science and cool stuff with would be adam savage and bill nye by far. but this is a really good combo too~!
14:34
I never heard of Steven seagal being slammed to the ground, I can’t find the video or picture.
What, why well because.
How to demonetize a video in 5 seconds.
It’s definitely 2024! 😂
I have such a big dumb smile on my face right now!
Three channels I'm already subscribed to, that I already love, all meeting for one video. Rad!!!!
Thumbnail doesn’t look like a bird
It took about 28 seconds for me to put it together. HAHAHAHAHAHA! ABSOULUTELY AMAZING CALL-BACK! I can't believe it's not butta
That guy satays absolutely thrilled, even after loosing his eye ........ great video.
The perfect collaboration. Happy Days !
13:12 poor fly
THIS was epic with Adam Savage so cool 😎 Love this video so cool
One full day with Adam Savage, and this was the experiment chosen?  🤷 🤦
The barrel needs to be steel, and the pressure and tank volume needs to be 100x greater. We want ballistic gel goose faced carnage.
Why does he look so much like Bobby Sands?!???  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Amazing to see adam here, I have been dreaming of a collab between you guys for years.
NEED MORE!!!!!
absolute banger of a video, great commentary and choices for sound. P.S. i hope this doesnt make me a comment leaver :P
Seeing Adam do the countdown brought back so much nostalgia
Bruh thumbnail definitely didn't look like a bird 🤣🤣🤣
Are we not going to talk about 14:35 LMAO
The coolest shots on Mythbusters all involved that rocket sled just outside Socorro… if you guys (and Adam) can get a shoot lined up there (even just sledding one car into another stationary car at 500mph), and shoot it at 50k+ fps, it may result in the coolest high speed shot ever taken 💥
I loved this video. Just a slice of americana lol
I feel like Im 20 minutes late to a mythbusters episode.
Lol, don’t show this video to Fabio, he’ll get PTSD.
remember me to the male model in the roller coaster meet a pigneon at full speed at the very first ride of this coaster
The safety protocol and instruction from Adam are beautiful things. As a safety professional, I can say he explained that perfectly and was clear about the procedure.
OK, so that is hitting the big time Gavin.
My new all time favorite Slo Mo video!
lol that Simon Adebisi tshirt!
man my new subwoofer makes this unwatchable with that wind
Fabio without hair looks like Matt Parker!
This should now be officially regarded as an episode of Mythbusters from this moment on. It has everything that made the show legendary.
The thumbnail makes it look less like a goose and more like a......  Am I the only one?
Damn that is wild
DAN, DID YOU AND BOBBY FINGERS BEAT EACH OTHER UP?!
love the collaboration between various YouTube channels. To be honest, I like the Slo Mo Guys ideas/set up better. Not the same when Gav and Dan are not an integral to the story. Thanks for sharing.
Is it just me or does that Bobby guy seem like he was trying too hard? And that was before he put the eyeball in his mouth.
What an inspection, listening to Gav talk about his thought process during this filming is impeccable. (Still not a comment leaver…) I think? I say this is a “non-regulation comment”
This is one of the greatest coming together of superpowers ever
Looked like weird al Yankovic, if the hair was darker coloured lol. Great video, amazing collaboration.
Years ago Gavin said he'd always wanted to do something with Adam Savage more than anyone. So glad to finally see it, i hope they have the chance to do more!
Gav: "Amazing fulfilling moment"  Adam: *smacks airtank w/fish*
@bobbyfingers is that an adebisi shank tee? because what a band
That's the dream. I grew up watching Mythbusters and I fell in love with inventions or odd fun contraptions for the fun of science... I'm so glad you guys got to get together and have a really fun day! :D
adam savage is who introduced me to bobbyfingers. super cool they are teaming up.
Is there anything else better than Adam Savage cracking up at something unexpected? There are, but none are nearly as contagious as his glee and joy. Great stuff.
The highest compliment I can give this video is that for 16 minutes i felt like I was watching an episode of Mythbusters. Bravo.
I have seen every episode of Myth Busters.  really miss the show. I feel like the duo of Adam Savage and The Slow Mo Guys could be the reincarnation of Myth Busters.  Myth Busters 2.0!!
Dan > adam
Sick vid, the editing with the music at the beginning was veery satisfying
😂😂😂😂 well my first thought was most certainly not why was there a “goose” being shoved down a tube…
Thanks guys !
Top
I haven’t laughed that hard at a video in quite awhile. 😍
I think of the slow mo guys as the new mythbusters.
This is the weirdest sh*t I've seen today. :)
And my math teacher said we wouldn't have calculators in our pockets.  Watching some of the smartest people I watch do math on their phones. xD
This is the funniest slow-mo vid I have seen. 😂 In tears at the hilarity of this.
man this  was awesome
the collab we always wanted, and needed
Aim. It. Up!
J Lube the preferred lube of fisters everywhere! 😅😅😅
Adam Savage is still launching weird things out of air cannons? Some things never change, and we love it!
I love how all of then start laughing after every shot with the cannon!
yeah this was just like MythBusters episode. : )
Glorious.
That cannon needs a faster release valve
I weirdly enjoy the little safety lecture of “no one goes past this point until I say all clear”. Folks who take that kind of risk seriously and make sure everyone is briefed is something I wish I would see in more videos ( although it may be a staple on this channel, I’m unsure ).
What's with the crazy bass rumbling throughout the video?
👍 für den Algorithmus
The absolute grin plastered on my face through the entirety of the video
What a truly glorious time to be alive!
Why is the ball valve and the transfer pipe so small?
get the new ipad pro, it has 2000nit double stacked OLED display. also test the screen flicker on high speed :)
The slomo shots were so funny to watch. And I just love Adam
Love the Key West shirt and wish I could’ve met ya here!
SLOPPY JOE'S 201 Duval St, Key West, FL 33040, Vereinigte Staaten The one, the only😋 Greetz from Germany
Yes the fight was definitely really and Gav did something bad enough to be susceptible to blackmail.
Thanks. Now I have a new pfp for my YouTube account
Pretty much the best example of using the internet the right way.
2 parts of my childhood colliding Adam & Gavin. Loved every second.
"It's an old fashioned bird canon. By garr its been a while" - Adam Savage after getting a call from the lads.
I didn't realise how much I missed Adam's laugh until he watched the first slow-mo review of the goose flying out the barrel 😅
Okay so next up the goose versus one of those zombie ballistic heads?
4:35 Hearing Adam say "3... 2... 1..."  again made me unreasonably happy
Where's Jamie at ? Hope he's well and happy as usual !!
I think this might be the best crossover of my childhood and my adult life
thought the thumbnail was Weird Al
No Fabios were hurt in the making of this….oh, damn!
BIRD CANNON RETURNS!
That was insane.
I don’t think that looks like a bird
started here, went to Tested ... finished with bobby and now back here ... ummm @Dan, what happened?
The collab I didn't know I needed
wassupp
The wrong birdshot
This is why I subscribed
Gav with the Sloppy Joes shirt 😊
i want to see the fight between bobby and dan!!!!!
This is truly the best timeline.
The collab I did not realise the world needed until I read the video title. 👏
That was a great team up with you all. I'd like to see Fabio's reaction to this.
that sound design tho lmao
It's all fun and games when Fabio looses an eye :)
I regret watching this while eating dinner.
Your target went from Fabio to The Rock with one duck
12:30 Jeff Bezos jump scare
I guess Dan had no way of knowing Bobby F has some very firmly held and spicy views on the Norwegian Monarchy...
Would have been cool if they used a clear pipe to see the forces that the wind is putting on the bird.
I am so happy to see @bobbyfingers blowing up more, it was crazy with his quality that some of his videos were only getting like 50k views. The algorithm is a fickle beast
Dan lost some weight and he looks great, congrats
Adam Savage. You guys. Got. Adam. Savage.
Gavin: Bobby. My Brain:  Oh wow it's Irish Dan.
That's no bird...
Please tell Adam to get James and get back on Mythbusters come back
Three of my favourite Youtube channels in one.  Amazing
if you could get the barrel lubbed with thin lube while the goose had thiccer lube that acts as a sort of sealant to help keep the pressure behind the "bird" that should be smaller but its fine if its got damn bigger than a ptarmigan i guess?
This has got to be the best crossover since the Avengers
14:32 had me laughing so hard
We have used air canons to shoot bullets at our enclosure windows to test for strength. That was lots of fun, but Fabio's fake face makes for more laughter. The air canon has been leaned up against a wall for years waiting for the next tests, maybe sometime this year.
Gav: Dan, you ever wonder why we're here?  Dan: it's one of life's great mysteries; why are we here? I mean, are we the product of some cosmic coincidence, or is there really a God watching everything? You know, with a plan for us and stuff. I don't know, man, but it keeps me up at night.  Gav: no, I mean like... why are we here in this quarry? wtf's all this stuff about god?
Gav at 13:05.
I swear this type of environment is Adam's natural habitat.  Whether it's with Vsauce, Veritasium, with these guys, or on his own, he's always at his best and most comfortable-looking doing absurd experiments in the name of data (and good visuals).  If he decided tomorrow to start doing MythBusters again, I'm sure it would take all of 5 seconds for it to feel like he had never stopped.
But...why?
This is so cool to see Adam does stuff like this again, like Gavin said. "Its like watching another episode of mythbusters"
Are they trying to communicate?  I feel like they are trying to communicate. It's a shame there is so much wind interference that it's *wind wind wind wind* " hahaha". Well...what was said?!
I'm a simple man.   I see adam savage, i watch the video.
This is exactly what I needed to see today.  Thank you all.
Adam Savage is a legend. Will always respect that man (and the others) for the amazing learning and amazing moments his show brought to our family.
The expression on that head is hilarious 😂
Went from Fabio to Agent 47 to Freddy Krueger.
Adam and Jamie are like fathers ive never met cuz ive watched them constantly for 10 years
Just excellent thanks guys
these faces are nightmare fuel
12:33 looks slightly like jeff bezos
Just watching Bobby Fingers video and I knew I’d seen that face before 😂
What a historic episode. Seeing Mythbusters and Slow Mo Guys crossover is not only a surreal delight, but puts into perspective how Gavin and Dan have totally carved their own style out of this personality-based science show format. I'd say the Guys have earned "hero status" alongside Adam. And if for nothing else, credit to Bobby for making this event happen.
thats not a bird...
Adam and the slow mo guys is the best combo ever imagined.
That Fabio bust is fantastic lol. The expression on its face is so good.
I feel like the music was way louder than it usually is in your videos. It was distracting, could hardly hear you sometimes.
Or you could ride a bike without a helmet, same result ;)
Me n' the boys moment, god bless
Anyone else immediately think of 'The Head' from Art Attack when they saw this thumbnail? 😂
Boys being Boys, Love it
14:33 That eye-popping recoil.
That moment when you realize that you've grown up with Gavin and watched him go from a bright eyed teen/ya to a grown man with peppered hair while Dan has stayed a quintessential Brit at ever stage. Cant wait to see them faffing about as old men.
But it looked nothing like Fabio. Derp
Gavin wearing a very Regulation Shirt, I see
I always love to see that they leave the safety bits in
Seeing adam in a giant open tract of land with that hat on just feels....right
"Grease this bird" Adam Savage-2024
I reject your reality and substitute my own :p
This may be your most phallic episode, beginning with the thumbnail (assuming you don’t change it at some point).
This is the best crossover ever. Need more Adam Savage slow Mo guys crossovers!
This was absolutely entertaining. Please do more collaborations. Just like Gavin, I grew up watching Mythbusters.
@bobbyfingers's shirt 😛😛  Anyone else see Oz?
I am glad I watched this after the Bobby Fingers video. if only to appreciate his Adebisi t-shirt.
8:48 Looks like a startled seal sliding off a wet dock into the water…
Classic J-Lube, of course for Veterinarian use only!
We need a video on Lichtenburg figures in acrylic 🎥🤯
Hi Dan Good bye Adam Savage
That was stupid and totally WORTH IT!
Who knew Fabio and Weird Al were long lost twins and why didn't someone tell me?
Gonna be honest took me a second to realise that was a simulated bird. Not a martial aid.
The point of this is?
The look on Fabio's face reminds me of Benny Hill. Smiling but kind of confused.
Them furiously doing math was great
Achievement unlocked: How did we get here?
some guy made the worlds most powerful slingshot, try that nxt
Omg this really feels like a mythbusters episode and it’s amazing
Quack, damn you.
after watching both slo mo guys for years and growing up with mythbusters, hearing Adam turn around and talk to Gavin was strange so only imagine how he felt
Adam's laughter is infectious.  That alone is worth it.
I’m living vicariously through you, Gavin. Stoked for this collab. Mythbusters was one of my absolute favorites, too
Incredible team-up
0:15 I watched a weirdly similar video late last night on a very different video hosting site for vastly different reasons…
Damn I miss Adam.
it's so heartwarming to see Adam give a safety speech before anything else <3
omg i love Bobbyfingers
More of this please! 😂
I watched Bobbys video on Patreon yesterday and seeing both Adam, who I grew up watching, and Gavin, who i've been watching for over 15 years now, was just wild. I'm so glad Bobby is getting more attention, he's one of the best creators working today, every video just goes beyond anything you can expect.
Best miniature ever
It is a rare occasion that I laugh so hard nowadays, but when the bird hit "Fabio" in the mouth, I laughed harder than I have in a long time.  Thanks Slow Mo Guys.
Please please please more with Adam if you get that chance. Mythbusters was my childhood. He’s such a fun guy.
I love the Oz shirt.
Bahahahahah de face at 14:34
Already excited for giant balloon june!
you guys... please high pass the audio.  this was absolutely unlistenable on a system with a subwoofer 🤣😭
This is getting close to a How Ridiculous video!
From the ashes of one company, comes the combination of others.
I was really hoping to see this but with a vacuum pulled at the front like they did for the supersonic ping pong balls
I’m sitting here attempting to describe what’s happening in this video to my wife, but the longer I talk, the more I see her stare of confusion morph into one of absolute horror.
More please, and thank you
OMG IT'S JEFF BEZOS WITH A WIG 🤣
Thanks Youtube
_"Am I missing an __-eyebrow-__ _*_eyeball..."_*                    – -Adam Savage- Silicone Fabio  I don't expect to be the first to have said this, and that's fine lol
Now Fabio needs to respond and confirm this is how it felt to him!
I knew exactly what was happening as soon as you said goose.
That's the same goose my friends mom has in her nightstand! How bizarre.. didn't think she liked science
Anyone think they were firing something else from the thumbnail? 😳
Fabio looks like Danny Carey!
Hell yes! Bobby Fingers is the man.. Who's lookin' afta ya kids?! Bom.. BOM BOM bom.
Oh my god it’s Bobby fingers
They're making millions doing this BS.   We're doomed as a species.
Obtuse, rubber goose, green moose, guava juice, giant snake, birthday cake, large fries, chocolate shake.
I hope Dan got a few good licks in on Bobby.
Long live savage
I use that same lube in my formula for giant bubbles, a little bit goes a long way.
SO COOL TO SEE ADAM
Gav change the thumbnail. it doesn't look like your hitting him with a bird....
Did Daniel and Bobby really get into a "real" fight or was that staged around the time you guys ate together after filming (according to Bobby's side of things)? That's kind of crazy and absurd. lol
this is simultaneously the funniest and most disturbing Slow Mo Guys video
That was so funny 😆
The Fabio's and the geese were just the perfect amount of gelatinous.
He went from Fabio to Marty Feldman.
Yoooo what a collab!
For months now, I had wanted to suggest for Adam to collab with you guys, due to knowing how impactful he has been on this channel... but never got around to it! So for this to have happened, *_I'M SO HAPPY_* for you guys!   It's great when good things happen to deserving folks! ♥️ And now... I watch with a HUGE smile on my face! 🙂😊😄😁 _EDIT: __11:18__ that's my exact expression I was talking about!!_ 🤣  (Also, I said it on Tested, I hope that if you guys don't start a new show with Adam and Bobby, that *_at the very least_* make one episode a year just like this!)
should have painted eyes on that
Whyd Weird Al have to go and get himself decapitated 😔
those dont look like birds, well maybe to the trailer park boys they do.
“I have some experience with that”🤣😭
I cannot stress the concerned look I got from my brother after I shouted "THE BIRTHING LUBE". I'll never forget Adam trying to walk on that stuff and slipping constantly.
almost couldn't watch the video.. because I was looking for that one arse hair on bobby fingers head the entire time... I think I did spot it..
60fps? I guess because you're in Texas huh
Best collab ever
I'm not sure what I've just watched, but it sure looked a hell of a lot better in slow mo!
That definitely looks like something else
7:31 nailed me
Slow Mo Guys, Adam Savage AND Bobby Fingers!! Fabio getting fonked in the face by a waterfowl? Could this be the greatest day in the history of YouTube?
LMAO Did _anyone else_ get a Six Flags advert, with rollercoasters featured prominently?!? 🤣🤣 Oh YouTube, your algorithm sure has a sense of humor!
The shot of everyone on their calculators is hilarious.
Adam Savage is the coolest dude to ever live.
A perfect collaboration!!!!!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
the 1" pipe really restricted how fast the tank dumped.  2" out of the tank would have been like a rocket.
They have nets now on either side of the roller coaster drop where Fabio hit the goose, presumably to prevent this from happening to a guest
Awesome! I’ve been waiting for this collaboration for ages!
The first head looks like angry kid from them mad video's back in the day lol
The thumbnail looks like Gav in a wig at first.
After the eye popped out, it kind of looked like Gav.
I really miss Gus :(
Definitely getting 'The Thing' vibes from this!
"Ballistics gel is made for smacking" is up there for favorite qoutes, right next to "Well there's your problem!" And "I swear I parked it right here!"
This has got to be the weirdest collaboration I have ever seen in my life
Looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooove
Now we need to have a "Fabio Reacts" video
right... "bird"
The thumbnail I saw did not look like a bird to the face….but it does look like a “bird” to the face 🤣🫣🤭
I'm watching this while listening to what a wonderful world
*meaty thwack*  *both chuckle*
Met a girl who had this happen whilst sky diving. Poor thing had a massive permanent bruise
He said dunk the goose in lube waaay to casually 😂
There is no time in history of the human kind where someone could ever say they witnessed shooting a ballistic gel goose covered in cow assist slime shot through an air cannon onto a mannequin head... until now! :)
Great video, I haven't laughed that hard in a long time.
Wow what a great name for a band Adam that was brilliant
So, was the fight real?
MORE SLOMO X ADAM
anyone else think the fabio looks like The Head from Art Attack? 😂
That moment of realization got me all emotional! I love feelings like that. I used to get them all the time when I was doing motorsport photography.  Like, " How did I get so lucky to witness something so personal and magical?"  It's those kind of moments that stick with you.
It's time to put that goose into a discarding sabot and see if you can indeed get a supersonic goose
This honestly brightened up my day. I never knew I needed to see the Slowmo guys, Adam Savage, and Bobby Fling in one video. Thank you
Just like Bart.
this is stupid! I love it!!!
Lube, then insert it  😅
14:35 is the best frame in this video.
That looks like something to the face… not sure if it’s a bird.
This has gotta be one of the top 10 dumbest things they've filmed in slow motion and it's one of best things I've seen them do over the years lmao.
Presenting frame 313 of the Fabruder footage...
Man, that Jeff Bezos dummy with hair took a beating!
Mythbusters x slo mo guys is the collaboration I’ve been waiting for since I started watching this channel in 2011. Love the vids and always have, they’re the highlights of my weeks. Keep it up! ❤
Easily the best upload this year! Well done all. ❤🎉
Im gonna be real with you. That doesn’t look like a bird. I would not have known it was a bird if you didn’t call it a bird. It looks more like a…
oh yes!!! I haven't even watched the video yet and I'm stoked.  What a lineup of YT personalities!!!
Dude, savage, gotta lube the rim but you get it.  Just jam it in with lube hard enough and one of the 2 structures is gonna give
of all things in the world to try, how in the name of all that is holy did you get this idea
Loved this video start to finish!
I swear @bobbyfingers reminds me of the real life version of Billy Walsh from Entourage!   Great video guys!
Fabio looks more like the guy from fast times at ridgemont high
Adam Savage just shows up whenever theres a cool thing happening in a desert
@14:09 so long and thanks for all the fish!  In to my face I didn't wish! But we will let Fabio go squish!
This is excellent!! :D
Nice video, but please use a low cut filter in your audio editing. This is awful to listen.
It was wild to see Fabo lose one i
well, now we know what would happen if a giraffe gave birth to a goose...
why mannequin look like Sharlto Copley?)))
More!
Bro will do anything for tested to get more subs (save your money)
Absolutely ridiculous lol
Don't do too many projects together. You may find that feeling to get too familiar!
@1:33  Jack Elam  👀
Getting a butterfly valve closer to the size of the tube with fix it. But Adam already knows this from his chicken cannon days
awesome collab. love to see great creators all together!
The recommended ratio is 1 part powder to 14 parts water and don't ask why I know that. And also don't ask how I recognized this immediately when they did the banana slip episode.
He wasn't hit by the goose but a bit of camera that the goose hit
This was magical to watch. If only this could be a recurring thing :)
Nailed it on the first time? Nah, I'm pretty sure he's done THIS EXACT THING before. With Adam Savage being Adam Savage, I wouldn't be surprised, honestly...
This is the best cross over
Adam savage telling Dan about bargain lube… the future is wild
Every now and again on this channel I think to myself, how is that an actual job 😂
Having raced karts on a track with clay surface for a majority of my life I'm keenly familiar with how stubborn that stuff is at sticking to one's shoes. Legendary video, seems like it was an awesome experience for all involved.
Seeing Adam Savage doing what he does brings me so much joy every single time
I NEED ONE OF THEM BALLISTIC HEADS HIS EXPRESSION IS HILARIOUS 😂
My wife has one of those, she doesn’t call it a bird
I thought that thumbnail was Weird Al getting donged at 75mph😂😂😂
If Adam had a nickel for every time he’s shot a bird out of an air cannon he would have at least two nickels. Not a lot, but weird that it’s happened twice.
It's like it's 2005 again, Adam is setting up stuff, you come back from school and TV is fun. 😌
Remember when Fabio got hit in the face by a bird on a rollercoaster 😂
That thumbnail blurs the line between goose and NSFW
I didn't realize Bobbygingers released a new video until now. He truly is the greatest thing to hasppen on Youtube since the internet. No wonder Adam is a fan! Greatest collab ever!
That's a ..... duck?
I enjoy your knowledge.
Breh, why that starting frame
:😍get me that goose  :😦but sir  :😍GET ME THAT GOOSE
As someone that shares a birthday with Fabio, and lives down the street from Busch Gardens Williamsburg... I approve
adam and the slow mo guys??? yeeeee☺️
Nice
This made me so damn happy. Three legends in one vid.
It had to be a nordic killed? Do mikel obama next!
Omg it finally happened!!!! Adam Savage on SMG!
Im the only one that saw the fly get demolished in 13:10. The poor fly land on that eye and don't see it coming
Adam Savage on Slo Mo guys made my year! He needs to be a regular!
Adam needs to be protected at all costs
Great project and collaboration. Great to see everyone working together like this. Dream team!
MORE PLEASE!!
First time hearing Adam swearing. Kinda surreal
It really is too bad Adam is such a liberal POS.
yea... that thumbnail doesnt look like a duck
@08:37 the real question if the head was anatomically correct, would it go go down its the throat...?
The group math session at 5:45 to figure out the speed is a great moment.
Adam's laugh is just the best
Guys, this is great. I thought about an important engineering calculation about the goose. I'm glad it worked ❤😂
Gav and Dan just lived the dream of every little boy who grew up in the 90s/early 2000s. Getting to spend a day in a quarry with Adam Savage. Congratulations guys!
Yeah sure.. that's a "bird"
Dude....watching this video just took me back to the good ol' days of Mythbusters. Such a nostalgia trip. My smile remained firmly upon from beginning to end! Thank y'all for this!!
This was one epic episode. The legend Adam Savage Collab with you guys. He seems like a swell guy. Loved myth busters. Hopefully we get to see more slow mo videos with Adam
My friends and I found this whole incident hilarious, with the most comical part being the hot blonde woman sitting next to Fabio laughing in his bleeding face when they arrived at the end of the coaster. Ever since then we've refereed to him as Fabio Birdface.
Christmas came early. Goose and all!
If this video taught me anything, it's that the original photo of Fabio getting headshot seriously undersold how hard that bird hit him.
This is the best timeline
Great video lol Cool collab between you, Adam Savage, and Bobby Fingers!
The real-life YouTube Dream Team
It's a wonderful time to be alive! Thank you for all the fun!
Now this is a collab
Is there slow mo of the fight?
Sick of Adam, the Mythbusters, messed up on so many things.. they couldn't even blow a fake house, but, I keep reading about homes blowing up!
I saw something else in that thumbnail...
Bobby Fingers!
I remember it being a small bird like a sparrow or something.
Anybody else think the bald Fabio looks like Jeff Bezos?
You all should do a series, similar to the super slow show where you team up with Adam Savage and revisit old Mythbuster experiments that would have benefited from extremely high speed cameras.
oh my god collab of the CENTURY
That segue from Gavin’s “dream come true” rapture to Adam gratuitously whacking a goose against a tank was impeccable.
This year for Balloon June.. it's lubed up Dan !!
I love this so much!
The knocking out the fake goose bit definitely would've been in the cut if this was a Mythbusters episode lmao
We love Adam, he should be part of the team!
Great video to click on while eating lunch xD
@ 08:40 the omg comment, the visual and the fabio facial expression.... 🤣🤣🤣
Poor Fabio
I cant be the only one who sees it..
This has by far been one of my favorite videos in recency!  Also an accidental pause frame of Fabio's head in a silly, destructive way has now become my new profile picture on things
I love when adam just shows up places. its so good
Bikers. Closed visors full lid or locked shut ✊️🤜🤛🙏🫶
This is the best kind of collaboration.
Would love to see you spritz an orange in slow motion
I really wish you guys had done this with bird bones. I mean… I REALLY WISH.
Id love to see some more @tested and Slow mo guys collabs JS
Oh my gawd ! Too many of my heroes in this video !!!
16:09 ABSOLUTELY THE BEST MOMENT-dldong 🍌😅
It takes a special kind of man to yell “lube shot!” with a straight face.
9:35 i have her, i have her... 😢
❤❤❤❤
Try a Seagull.
Well, That's something you don't see everyday...
Adam’s laugh and the countdown, it’s Mythbusters all over again. God I miss that show.
Whole new meaning to stuffing a goose.
Great job Guys!
I would love if Adam became a regular on this channel, what a match made in Heaven.
For a splif moment, I thought this was an actual episode of Mythbusters.
Can I just appreciate Adam calling Dan and Gav Geniuses? Like, wholeheartedly no joke, that is mad props and respect.
I wonder what Fabio feels about this?
shoulda used a whole plucked bird lmao
I’m just surprised Gus managed to have an opinion that wasn’t funded by Bethesda.
Oh, so you’re not going to even mention Dan getting into a fight with Bobby after the BBQ dinner?
bros filming in Texas and didn't invite Destin from SmartEreveryDay with his crazy supersonic baseball cannon xD
?!?!?!
I think it's safe to say, that would sting
“Adam Savage mixes a bucket of bargain lube” should be the title
Can you guys try to film welding in slow motion?
Poultry in motion
ADAM AND GAVIN?!?!
"…a _honkin'_ pressure tank."  I mean, you need that to fire a goose, don't you?
Can't believe they shot John C McGinley with a lubed bird
Crazy that none of them know what a goose looks like
0:24 Actually I was wondering when Bad Dragon got an air force
Was that fight with Bobby & Dan real? Did Bobby really blackmail them to get the footage? :)
The animal lube brings back childhood memories of my mum forearm deep in a sheep 🐑🤏
On one of the last ones, he went from looking like Fabio to looking like Gary Busey...😂
Why does “Fabio” look like Danny Carey from Tool?
Adam is such a legend. This was a brilliant episode.
Working with Adam Savage; you guys really are living the dream!  I'm truly impressed at how much your channel has evolved from when I first started watching many years ago.
Seeing Adam laugh at slow mo footage brings back feelings I completely forgot I had😂
These guys together, just can't go wrong. Epic
Adam's laugh is pure joy, I finished binging Mythbusters recently it's nice to hear it again haha
It's a shame you didn't have Fabio himself present to comment.  That would have been hilarious.
Oh, it’s all fun and games until someone loses an eye 12:50
I would love to see the footage in sloMo backwards
Wind screens/socks are a must for your cameras next time lol. There is always wind when you least expect it to mess up your audio.
Bargain lube. lmao.
I feel you have to have seen Bobby's video to fully appreciate this project. The holy grail of YouTube collabs
Bobby's Adebisi shirt is amazing.
Even Matt Parker was part of the team. Strange wig by the way.
No age respect XD Go get the damn birds mates!
I enjoyed this so much more than I should have. lol
not upto the mark.... i liked all of your videos but sorry to say my slowmo guys this is not good.....
Isn't Bobby Fingers also known as Bobby Chrome from the band Rubberbandits?
now this is a collaboration i have dreamed about since i first watched Slo Mo Guys over a decade ago
Genuinely thought this was a Weird Al video. That head looks like a blond version of him.
This looked very disturbing…I like it
@bobbyfingers is so epic!
I cant think of the last time something made me smile like a toddler this much. prefect cross over and just absolutely silly video.
Copper piiiiiiiiipe  recognised the accent didn't expect it to be one of the rubber bandits lol
imagine if Mythbusters had the same camera tech back then that we have today... We need a reboot lol
That would definitely give you a new outlook on life
It's Slop O'Clock Fabio, lemme see you grit those teeth!
so surprising how aerodynamic birds can be
Next stop: Alabama for Destin's supersonic air cannon!
So So So Great to see Adam!!!! He brings such great energy
"bird" who picked that thumbnail ?
lol way too many furries know how effective JLube is… I couldn’t stop laughing when Adam lost the bird. “Yeah, that sounds about right” XD
bout time you guys made it together!!!!!!!
Working with Adam Savage had to be amazing. He just seems like the kind of guy who just wants to do the weirdest experiments ever.
Why does it feel like Mythbusters is about to get reborn with these jokers under a different name? I'm freaking here for it.
I thought it was something else 💀
You ever wonder why we're here?
Yes. A goose.   Thats what we're calling it
Turning Fabio into Jeff Bezos at 75mph 🦆
That eye popping out was something straight out of Akira or Hadashi no Gen
Watching Adam Savage and Slo Mo Guys collab is such a jolt of pure happiness and nostalgia
This felt like a proper episode of Mythbusters. Hit me right in the childhood
Who's the drunk Irish hobo
Sometimes, when you least expect it, there's comes along a thumbnail that MUST be clicked....
Adam Savage, goose cannon range safety officer. 😆 Love the Collab!
I opened the bobby fingers and Slow my guys' videoes at the same time. I did not expect them to be linked!
12:29 dummy turned into Destin
Dude, duuuuuuuude... this is one of the coolest video in all internet...
"What a professional!" in the context of firing jelly gooses at silicon heads is something that can be said of few other people besides _him_
Birds covered in copious amounts of lube, someone out there gets of to that for sure
It looks so so funny every time it hits! Pure gold!
12:23 Lol. He deformed into Nicolas Cage. Hahahaha.
I went and watched Bobby's video BEFORE i allowed myself this pleasure.  Dear god its all so perfect.
The thumbnail does not look like a "bird".
When I saw “Adam Savage” I thought “that’s cool”.  When I saw “Bobby Fingers” I couldn’t click fast enough
I was actually at BG's when Fabio got absolutely hammered by that goose lol.. was just a wee little 4yo but man, thats something you just cant forget LMAO
Adam's boundless energy is truly inspiring! He tackles every project with such gusto and passion. ❤
What do you mean, No one asked for this?!?  I specifically asked for this...
J-Lube is the secret ingredient to making giant soap bubbles 😉
It’s simply amazing how anticlimactic it is at normal speed, but once you slow it down, oh how that changes.
6:11 had me dying 🤣
I LOVE ADAM!!!
There are only two people in America I know that can pull of this cannon, that's Adam Savage and Destin from Smarter Every Day.
EXCELLENT COLLAB
when you see adam, gave and dan know that you're gonna see magic.
I frickin' love Adam's laugh, oh god, it's so contagious haha!
За приглашение Адама респект! жду новых проектов с ним!
I really miss the MythBusters show😢
Massive smile on my face throughout this whole thing, mythbusters was so fully my childhood and slo mo guys have done such a good job of carrying that torch, so to see this collab is amazing, genuinely
Silly goose
It's weird having Adam there and not seeing the black and white stripes behind the bird
Man, the sloppy joes shirt has me a bit choked up
One of the funniest results of the Fabio Incident was Craig Ferguson relating the story in one of his stand up routines. Find it and laugh yer arse off. But that's the first thing I thought of when I saw the thumb, friggin awesome! Reality is SO much stranger than fiction!
Holy savage adams!!
The ending.  Hahahahaha. Cheeky
Everyone standing around doing math for a minute made me bust out laughing.
Bro is not birding up with this one...
getting the Only Fans people excited with new options to bring in the viewers 😉
Adam's quote on mythbusters "the only difference between screwing around and science is writing down the results" literally changed the trajectory of my life. It's so good to see him still being this excited about screw... Em. Science!
Without hair it is Jeff Bezos.
Two weeks.
I love how Gav, Adam, and Dan all pause and start doing math Gav and Adam doing math for measurements but Dan doing math of the payload
Gav?  Why does the dummy look like @JamesWillemsStuff?
That was beyond awesome! Best people on the internet and my idol Adam Savage in one video. Thanks guy! Made my day
That thumbnail😂😂 looks like a ballistic gel wiener being thrown at someone face.
Reboot of mythbusters with Adam Gav and Dan?
Oh, it's a goose.  I though SMG got a Bad Dragon sponsorship
Absolutely loved this crossover 😊❤.
who was in front of the camera for that last projectile looked like that lube was being miss used
3 people all mathing, and comparing their answers was the most @tested and @ theslowmoguys thing I have ever seen! I love this video!
Nothing like seeing Adam Savage in a quarry and weird equipment
Is it just me or do the slowmo shots make the bird seem like a wet fish.
Awesome! What does the real Fabio think?
Hey Dan, Adam didn’t steal your job, the rubber head did. Probs for the best 👍 😉
Can you another bollistic Gell video please.
This is funny in a gruesome way.
Fabio took a huge load to the face. What a pro.
Awesomeness
This complete video is a prime example and proof that men NEVER grow up. I like it.
Please go watch Bobby Fingers
I remember when Fabio got hit in the face with the goose on the Apollos Chariot rollercoaster at its opening event. My mom's best friend was sitting in the row behind him as a model extra for the shoot and she still talks about the blood to this day.
A slo mo guys/ Adam Savage (with maybe a wild Kari Byron appearance)  Discovery show would be the greatest culmination of my childhood.  I'd probably cry.
The mythbuster Guy even in France we know this show
Everytime I see Adam's face I'm back to being a kid watching Mythbusters on tv
nobody thought to get fabio for this?!
It's "The Head" from Art Attack!!
As someone who used to live in a place with a lot of clay in the ground, Adam's reaction was instantly relatable. I remember being a kid and going out wandering when it was damp, and then coming back with heavier feet and noticeably taller — and the extra effort making me too tired to hose down my boots clean once… and I never made that mistake again.
oh my god im so excited for giant balloon june THEYVE GOT TO DO IT
I've never seen someone so happy to be ducked in the mouth
Seeing grabbin fee with adam savage was really wholesome
So much guy code in this video 😂😂
Every frame an album cover.
Adam, Gav, Dan and who???
I LOVE the safety lecture followed by putting your face next to an air hose held on with a hose clamp and some electrical tape just for some added safety.  OSHA approved!
Best ever!!!
My first thought wasn't "What is a ballistic gel goose" It was definitely something else...
Measuring speed w/ a high speed. Adam's got to be an expert by this point. I'm surprised he didn't bring a grid to fire in front of.
y tho
This is the collab the internet needed
Slow MomGuys please do what you soda at 11:40sec ! Dan, lubed up trying to get in a giant balloon could be one of the funniest videos in history.
What was with the fight with Dan and Bobby that he showed on his channel?
3 of my favorite youtubers in one video. What a glorious day.
That thing looks like a giant slug.
I really like that even though Adam has a reputation for doing insane stuff, he's all over the safety side of things.
5:40 everybody just calculating lol
Easily one of my favourite Slow Mo Guys vids of all time, this was so fun to watch.
Ducks are aerodynamic , who knew? Duh
Yo where I can get that ADEBECI shirt??
8:07 It's not a calf from a cow but Dan could have birthed a goose from a tube.
Of course there's the random Irish guy in the middle of such insanity, g'wan ya good ting!
A mad Irishman, a mad American and two mad Brits. What more could you want on your Wednesday afternoon
you should have gotten adam & eve or some other sextoy shop to sponsor this
Adam Savage is that style of ADHD where he works on the same wavelength as someone who is VERY HIGH but he is also VERY SMART.
you're desthpicable!
Well now you have to put Dan in a giant balloon filled with lube.
I still feel bad for that goose that was hit with Fabio's face.
The absolute best part of this video is Gavin, Dan, and Adam all three looking at their phones and doing math at the same time
I got a good laugh out of this. 😂
Super!, but i saw the bobby fingers video as well...was the fight real ?
This is what the internet was made for.
What was the fight about after dinner?
Tested + Slo Mo Guys... the collab we've all been waiting for.
A video like the one you did with Zack Snyder, but with Adam Savage would feed families 🐐
Ok the first seconds alone and Adam Savage give me Nostalgic Mythbuster Vibes ...
really wasn't expecting to hear the phrase "cow juice"
This is the perfect combination of intrusive thoughts and science 😂
::Adam rinsing Clay off his shoes::   Welcome to Texas.
really cool to see Adam and Gavin working together.
Adam Savage is always a treat! I LOVE the music on the slow-mo! Can you guys put up a link to it?
У вас получится отличный коллектив!)
You need to do more videos with this face 😂
Obviously more fun setting it up and hanging out than the watching the video as a viewer.
Watching this I got a little emotional. Seeing Adam in this setting brought back Mythbusyers vibes. And so many memories
2 englishman, an Irishman and an American walk into a quarry.
11:18 aw he was crying!
POW!!! Right in the kisser....
Too bad Adam couldn't bring Buster along, lol.
5:05 - Instant nostalgia. Seeing Adam and company in a quarry doing something ridiculous, then hearing him laugh looking at a high-speed camera shot just instantly taking me back.
This video was FABIOLESS!!!!
TBH, Fabio's teeth in this were the most unsettling wobbles and wiggles
12:53 Marty Feldman is that you? 14:34 Yep, it's him alright.
So cool and so funny.
am i wrong? i did not think "Bird" when i saw the thumbnail...
proud of bobby fingies
Me looking at the thumbnail: "Oh, recreating the best actor/model getting a goose to the face, and not the other way around."
14:33 Dat face
At 6:25 I was literally thinking about how cool it was for you guys to add some bts of you guys doing the math for the shot on the fly, then bobby pointed out how surreal of a moment it was and it took me to whole other thought process, dope vid. This one really makes you appreciate the process, I usually like to turn my brain off for slow mo vids, but this is the exception I guess!
just a buncha dudes being dudes
Bobby Fingers is from the Rubber Bandits. I haven't seen him without the grocery bag over his face.
Fabio morphs Egor at 14:34.
Thanks to everyone getting together to make this collab!  Put a big smile on my face.
Without the wig, that looks like a bust if jeff bezos
I want a YT crossover! - Which YouTubers? - Yes!
Adam Savage is a legend, no idea who bobbert is.
This just is perfect. This channel was inspired by mythbusters and now adams finally in a video. This whole thing is amazing
This whole episode is one heck of a slippery slope.
IT IS FINALLY HAPPENING!!!!
Adam's technical skills: 9/10 Adam's delighted laughter at mayhem: off the chart
Gavin got to fulfill the dream of most millennials: being a semi-mythbuster for a day
Adam savages laugh will never not make me happy
I'm sitting here, watching this going 'how the hell did this collaboration come about' then going 'we need more!'  Adam is always a delight to watch, and watching his shenanigans in slow motion is making me all giddy.
Adam talking about the "mythbusters moment" of "how the hell did we get here" followed by Gav's version is so great and casually wholesome. Part of me wants Adam and the boys to visit Alabama to try this in Destin's baseball cannon.  Haven't laughed this hard at slow mo since dan popped out of a water balloon on a trampoline and realized we could see his d*** flopping around
This is magical!
What a day of surrealism. Made up for you guys! This vid had me beaming!
- have you brought any goose onto the planet? - two weeks... - your eyeball is out - two weeks   Total Recall reference :)
8:14 that is such a creepy frame
14:34 favorite face moment!
Bobby Fingers is a criminally underappreciated channel. So funny, so inventive and so chill to watch. Thanks to all involved on this collaboration and hopefully viewers will head over to give Bobby a subscribe.
I swear, Adam Savage looks the same now as he did 20 years ago. The man is perpetually housed at mid 40's.
We need more videos Adam with the slo mo guys
Match made in heaven. Goose heaven, I think. :)
Gavin Free: "Adam turned to me to check the phantoms are ready, I just found that so fulfilling" *cuts to Adam hitting a goose on an airtank*
I love it when I can cross something off my bucket list that i didn't even know was on there.
Bobby Fingers makes video that are transcendent. I was crying with laughter at the end of his video when he is singing to the slow mo you guys did.
So funny!!!!!
cow juice
after seeing both Gav and Adam together im now wanting more Savage and Free Content whether it be Ballistics Grade Geese or other random things being flung into other objects with that massive air cannon
All of yall better go give BobbyFingers the love he so rightly deserves. Thanks so much to Dan, Gavin, and co for deciding to participate in this, truly a collab for the ages.
I'd like to see Mr. Savage make a "Supa-Valve" for his next air cannon. Instant air dump with no restriction from a 4" valve.
How have these guys never done a video with the Mythbusters before
So glad to see bobby fingers get a big collab
Watching Adam manage getting everything ready was such a treat.
🔥Collab.
I appreciate them showing the safety precautions  being restated before the firing and loading.
I wish you guys had done one with a ballistics labs dummy head. I'd be curious what this would do if it hit something more "lifelike".
Its really cute knowing how big Gav is success wise and is still star struck to be working with someone, its sweet.
5:30 - 5:50 My favorite part was three nerds silently go muttering maths to themselves, I love science so much. 5:15 - 6:00 lmao
Whoa, did Dan really had a fistfight with Bobby Fingers? Eather way, that knee to the rib looked painful.
The first slow-mo shot of the bird flying, where Adam burst into laughter, made me burst into laughter as well.
seeing Adam Savage who is one of the guys who made my childhood on the mythbusters joining the slow mo guys is like a dream that looks so much real to be true.
I love Adam Savage. You know it's a banger when you have the Slow Mo Guys and Adam Savage they alway make great content. Well done mates. We need more Adam in these videos
there is something deeply disturbing about watching them shove a transparent chunk of gel covered in lube  into a barrel
I'm Gobsmacked
not gonna lie, when i first clicked on this video, i had to do a double take cause i thought i had clicked on adam's video not urs. this really is a dream come true for both me and you guys
Jay Mohr is a good sport to go along with all this, especially uncredited.
It's fabio!   WAIT.   It looks like Weird AL!
It took me until the first shot at Fabio when I finally remembered why you guys chose Fabio lol amazing.
Adam Savage and Slo Mo Guys.  Something unexpected, yet fantastic.
What a combo! Bobby Fingers AND Adam Savage!
Adam Savage and The Slowmo Guys in one video. What an iconic meeting of the minds
This is officially the best Slow Mo Guys video ever. I'll always treasure your early stuff, but doing a collab with THE Adam Savage is where you know you've officially "made it!"
This is now my favorite collaboration EVER. Well done!
Yall doing Danny Carey bad here 😂 I doubt he signed off for his likeness to be used as the head 😂
So great seeing Adam, Gavin, and Dan working together.
Please more colabs.
This is the best video I've seen so far this week. I was actually there the day he got hit by the Goose. Busch Garden's Williamsburg,VA, It happened on Apollo's Chariot opening day and he was on the first ride to leave the station. Pretty much ruined their big grand opening for the ride for about an hour and a half while they cleaned up the ride. They took him out through a service entrance behind Roman Rapids.
Fabio was a client at the time of the bird strike. He is probably the nicest celebrity I've met. So gracious to his fans. I feel weird watching this video, but damn, I like the Slo Mo guys, too! I'm torn!
Man Fabio really could’ve used a falcon to protect him
This is truly a dream team , just a bunch of people all having a great time and entertaining us , and with Adam ...sorry but brings back so many mythbusters memories!
14:34 my new profile picture
Did Dan really fight Bobby Fingers?
Check out the DJI wireless mics. Super cheap and great in wind.
what did I just watch??? :D
How many legends can you fit in one shoot?
13:07 kinda looks like Gav
Totally haven't been waiting for this for, oh I dunno, YEARS?! Hoping you guys had a ton of fun with this and we get to see more collaborative projects. Maybe something just as zany but with a little more depth, if I can be just a teensy bit critical. I'm all for seeing a generous caricature of myself being cannon-balled in the face by a slippery chicken, but I guarantee that, with your combined brainpower, there's some ante to be upped here. No question. Live chicken, maybe a live human head next time? Animal cruelty isn't animal cruelty if you're also being hurt in the process. I think it cancels out the first instance out somehow. I dunno, not a scientist. Disclaimer. Regardless, I'm really glad you guys had the chance to do this. Also, anyone who doesn't follow Tested as well, you should definitely go do that. Why aren't you already? Are you insane? Have you lost your mind? Even if you're not the type to practice active listening, it makes great idle or background "brain-ensmartening". Do people still do that? Background videos? Or are we all on smartphones now.? Either way, for a third time, super happy to see this finally manifest into something digestible to fill the "5475 days without a Mythbusters/SMG collab" sized hole in my heart. Truly heart-warming-... uh, lubricating. :D
Did you guys actually get in a fight with Bobby fingers.
yessss Bobby Fingers
Love the vibes, just some dudes having fun shooting ducks out of a tube
The hairless fabio looks like an uncanny valley 'way-too-happy' Bezos :/
After watching for 13 minutes and 30 seconds I had this sudden realization: this aint corrupted at all.
An Irish man, two English men and a mythbuster walk into a quarry.... 🤣
THanks.
This had season 1-3 MythBusters energy and I’m here for it. We need more with Adam and the boys
Best combo EVER!
12:20 so this is how jeff bezos was made?
(uncontrollable laughing at a gel goose compressing into Fabio's grinning maw, then slapping him int the face with its tail on the way out)
Adam and Gavin is a WAY overdue meet up. I can only imagine the experiments and such that these two would come up with.
Hell yeah!
"It's best when they're unconscious" 😂
Oh no! The thumbnail immediately brought back the memory of poor Fabio with a busted nose. I needed no additional references. Less than a minute in practically confirmed the thought behind the video.
Adam savage allways Welcome
Is this a bird? Are you sure? 😅😅
Without the hair, the head looks like Jeff Bezos
Great day for science!  and YouTube fantastic video as always
I was really hoping they would go full power at some point.
Everything always looks cool in slow mo.
Let's give a big shoutout to today's sponsor for this video: Bad Dragon.
All that lube. Jamie Hyneman would be so proud.
This was brilliant.  I would be fan-girling out if I got to meet Adam Savage, but I'd also be doing that with the two of you!
Truly an inspirational piece.
"Honking pressuretank" Nice one Gavin!
I never thought we would see this crossover but it is amazing
Where can One aquire such powerful lube so I can use it for recreational activities ?
this has probably already been said, but at first I wondered why Adam was shooting at weird Al...
14:36 is the real life meme
I don’t need to hear Adam Savage say lube anymore in my lifetime, I’m set.
Should've brought Joerg from slingshot channel in on this
The head looks like Weird Al Yankovic
We can all agree this is by far the most boring slomo vid you guys have produced, ever right? What a waste of a collab with Adam.
Shoot an adult toy out of a cannon.  leave it to Jamie
I thought the story was going to be about a guy helping an animal give birth, but the mother shot the baby into the guys face
I legit thought that was Weird Al Yankovic in the thumbnail. 😳😅🤷🏻‍♂️
Are those for sale? I need to settle a dispute.
Jaw-dropping
So....why were you doing this again?
Some notes on J-lube: 1. When prepared with boiled/distilled water, bottled and cooled it is safe for *most* cavities you can think of.  The peritoneal however is inside of the abdominal wall and holds your heart, lungs and major organs. If you can reach into the peritoneal cavity from any of the other cavities, you’ve got bigger problems that getting lube in there!  2. Adam was WAY too liberal with the powder to water ratio. That bottle will make a whole BATHTUB full of lube, not a bucket.   3. don’t fill a bathtub with lube. Seriously. It’s near impossible to get out of, Whoever you put in it WILL fall and break a towel rail off the wall and you WON’T get your airbnb security deposit back.   4. That goose needs a flared base, no wonder you kept losing it up there.
Can those birds be implemented with radar tech and launched into a tornado with slowmo data also? Whole new view of chasing!
does anyone else find that air cannon underwhelming? idk if its the length or what but it always seems like its not that fast...
What a cooperation project to just drop on a Wednesday
Fantastic collab between everyone involved and a great little sneak peek behind the scenes of Adam's safety brief about being around the air cannon. If anyone there is an expert on this stuff, it'd be him. Also loving the assorted collaborations you boys have been doing lately. This one here, How Ridiculous and Kentucky Ballistics recently, etc.
The amount of animal birthing lube Adam has worked with must be up there all time
heater 🔥
I just wish that @CorridorCrew took this footage and turned it into some kind of challenge making the goose and Fabio real
J-lube. Used for F#sting..
We need to see Adam getting slapped in slo mo again. Come on guys. Do it. Do it. DO. IT. Also, this kinda thing should be study material for all animators. Such perfect cartoonisms.
We… the world needs more Adam Savage and Slow Mo Guys collabs
Wth happened between Dan and bobby at bbq?😂😂
Oh my, the end of the scene at 14:35 is very disturbing
That happened the year I was born
bahahahahahah ok ok that first shot tho was just perfect!!!
You can just imagine how birds interfere with jets
Truly a highlight of the potential beauty of the internet bringing all these random talents together and then sharing the glorious results with us all. Thank you internet for not always being terrible.
Dan, mate, Adam out ranks you:) Just remember, one day you might show up and out rank someone else :)
When I've answered the question, "who is your hero", throughout my life, its always been Adam Savage and Im really glad I can say that.
What a milestone to collaborate with one of the greatest science communicators of our generation. So proud of the Slow Mo Gits, and here’s to the start of a beautiful friendship.
3 smart men staring at their phone calculators trying to do basic physics is such a mood
11:16 should have made the face like those stress balls with the flour/corn starch, so after the impact it would keep the same face roughly lol
Childhood Dream come true here!
Cant understand why im laughing so much
Made the mistake of eating lunch during this video... yikes
14:35 I love this
This video was just lovely. Great way to start the day.
What a dream team! We need more Adam Savage and Slow Mo Guys!
man it makes me so happy to see that adam savage literally hasn't changed even a bit when it comes to goofy stuff like this.
That's Mythbusters vibe is priceless ... So goood
Happy flashbacks of Adam being magical on location :-) more of this, guys :-)
Having taken a pigeon to the helmet at 80mph on my motorcycle I know how that dummy held felt.  Me it was like being hit by a sledge hammer!
Destin and his air cannon are going to feel left out.
Girls: hes probably out taking to other girls  The guys:
nooooooooo way
I can't believe its not duck.
nah see i thought yall were doing this for bikers advocacy for full face helmets, oooo ye try a beak! its like a FMJ on the front of that projectile!
Me: "Is that Weird Al yankovic? Oh...It's Fabio...."
God the combination of technical skill and artistry to make something so silly is just wonderful.
Adam Savage shoving a lubed-up ballistic gel goose into a massive tube is not something I expected to see on The Slow-Mo Guys, but maybe I should have. Great vid as always!
Is it just me or does the thumbnail look a little ..... Phallic
Congrats Gavin on meeting one of the coolest engineers that we all love from Mythbusters- Adam Savage
5:48 I really love we got a clip of EVERYONE doing the calculations at the same time lol true collaboration
This is the best kind of content. Thanks Adam, Gav, Dan, and Bobby!
I was wondering who's buying those giant tubs of lube. The more you know.
How Disney gets story board footage for Frozen 3
"...don't let go of the tail." I'm DYING :D :D :D If anything, I have MUCH more sympathy for Fabio after seeing this!
why is the music volume so loud it interferes with the people talking
1:26... a "honkin pressure tank" Really? REALLY? (ok, ok... it was a good one)
Gav was a lot quieter in this episode than I think he's ever been - more than a bit star struck maybe?
This was so amazingly fun from start to finish. 3 great channels all joined in solidarity of goose-to-the-face-action. Love you all lol
Incredible video! Adam Savage is a god. Love that man. I love the Fabio  head, I've never seen anyone so excited about getting hit in the face by a ballistic gel goose.
This video gave me goose bumps.
Did bobby really beat you guys up? Cant be true. Dan is a savage.
I always thought that Adam should revisit some of the myths with better tech... like back then they had what? 25k fps slow mo cameras? Imagine seeing his cement truck explosion at 1 million fps.
YESSSSSS BOBBY FINGERS CROSSOVER
1:45 man this is so frellin awesome! The best slow mo camera people, the best makeshift engineering creator, and the artist with a plan.  Three awesome sets of creators teaming up for making awesome stuff. That’s the way we all like it.
What a great video. To see one of my childhood heroes, THE Adam Savage, back in his element alongside two of my favourite creators, Gav & Dan, warmed me up inside. This is what YouTube was made for, it doesn't get any better than this. Thanks to everyone who worked together to make it happen.
My dream YouTube video!! Adam Savage and the Guys!!
Dont Sleep on Bobby Fingers!!
What a damn dream
Bobby is one of the funniest things on the internet
Filming with Adam… you’ve made the big times now! ♥️♥️♥️
I love content with Adam Savage (when it’s not narrated and edited by those Myth Busters people.
Having Adam savage on here was an amazing and incredible idea, I hope he comes back for a lot of videos because the experience he has combined with his technical knowhow could really step up your videos and I bet he has a plethora of good ideas for videos too.
That was pure fan service  Thank you
The Slo Mo Guys + the Adam Savage = A win for us all!
I had a bird, hit me in the face while riding my motorcycle one time. I was wearing a helmet but still lotta blood
4:50
This is one heck of a team.
In thumbnail Bird look like something that it shouldn't.
This is one of the funniest video ideas ever....
It genuinely felt like it went Mythbusters then Slow Mo Guys for the part of my life watching weird vaguely sciencey things semi-regularly, so this felt less like a crossover and more "the early days meeting the current". Great stuff all involved!
I literally just watch the Mythbusters pirate special last night where Adam was making giant air cannons! Such a cool collab and video!
Poking in on all three of you because this brought a beautiful smile. can't stop smiling with just the energy and excitement.Thank you all so much. A dream of mine to see you all working together!
Would be cool if you could have more realistic dummies, bones, fat, skin, feathers, and somehow incorporate how the duck and Fabio would actually react , rather then a dead on shot. In reality the bird probably slowed itself down an inch or two from his face, plus Fabio flinching, I'm sure beak and claws would play a huge role... This was kinda .. slimy and perverted in many ways.
Was wondering if Dan wasn’t gonna be in the video, then he just pops up with “he’s doing my job” about Adam lmao makes sense now
The leech like motions of those geese 😂😂
Fabio LMFAO
"here comes the airplane"   xxD
Jesus, I've been watching so many of the Mythbusters channel's recent re-runs that it didn't register for a second in the opening that Mr.Savage didn't quite belong! What a treat!
I literally think about Fabio getting hit by a bird while riding a roller coaster at least once a week. It's one of those intrusive thoughts that just rushes into my consciousness every so often. I can remember the day it happened vividly and everything, it was March of 99 and I was home "sick" from school. ET came on after Price is Right and there was Fabio all bloody faced getting off a roller coaster.
Oh my Gosh 🙄 Tooo *good* that 2nd Attempt 😑👌 The expression on Fabio
This is a collaboration with all my favourite YouTube people 🤯
Love that saftey speech
I really don't know how to respond to this, except 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
The Fabio head alternates between actually looking like Weird Al and Joe Walsh.
Dip Adams shoes in the lube the next time. It would be a hilarious slow mo-movie.
We need more adam savage collabs!
Just blokes out in a quarry doing bloke things with a big air cannon.
I was at busch gardens the day fabio got hit by the bird on the apollos chariot! Lmao
I'm 1 second in and i see adam savage and I love it.
Why are you shooting the bird at Weird Al?
On todays episode of what the hell am I actually watching
Wtf did I just watch? And why am I enjoying it so much 🤣🤣
In which Gav is heard to say "Bobby brought the Fabio heads and geese...".
This is just plain Amazing..
adam savage and the slo mo guys yes more please there should be a full cross over with the 2 og mythbusters
25 years almost to the date when the real Fabio got smacked in the face on a rollercoaster by a Canadian goode 😂😂😂
Someone call discovery! Mythbuster: high speed
7:00 yeah, you made it bro
Gavin and Dan is amazing enough add Adam savage how could you top that
Howdy from Temple, Texas, USA!
This isn't a normal Slow Mo Guys episode. This is a love letter to Adam.
I was hoping for a "full beans" for the grand finale :P
the thumbnail for this video XD
while riding my motorcycle at about 75mph on the highway,  had a bird hit my bike's mini wind deflector and subsequently cartwheel right into my face - smash!!!!  As I was wearing my full face moto helmet, I was unharmed - but a bit stunned!   It's quite an impact, and another good reason to ALWAYS wear a full face moto helmet!  I've had june bugs hit me in the throat before, and the bruise (and yellow guts explosion) is annoying at minimum!
Clicked on this thinking it was a tested video! A dream come true I never knew I had!
We need more Adam! We demand more Adam!
My mind
You guys really missed the opportunity to put Adam Savage in the video title
well, now we're going to need the lube balloon
This is the greatest collaboration i never expected but im so happy to see
This almost turned into a Mythbusters episode about quicksand 🤣
I'm gonna be the first to say I didn't see a bird in that thumbnail
You have to understand as well, that this is a study into the physics of elasticity and plasticity of various materials and biological structures. As a sculptor, 3D modeler and animator, access to this technology is golden. It's also so f-cking absurd. I love it.
As a long time fan of both Slo Mo Guys and Mythbusters, as well as a subscriber to both this channel and Tested, this was an absolute dream collab.   PUHLEEEZ DO MORE VIDS TOGETHER!!
It made it look like Fabio turns into Weird Al for half a second. Such a fun moment to witness.
Am I missing............an eyeball?
Wtf 2:59
Adam absolutely just had that cannon lying around for years, waiting for its moment to return.
Literally 3 of my favorite channels smashed into one!
So that's how birds are born 😮
Without the wig that dummy kinda looks like Jeff Bezos😂
The thumbnail DID NOT look like a bird
No way Adam is there :O Myth-busters reborn ?
OMG a collab with the original Mythbuster!
This is basically a potato cannon except 100 times better
Lmfao I saw bobby’s vid in my sub list first this goes so hard
Oh my God. This is amazing.
Absolute legendary video
Love @bobbyfingers, new video coming soon from him 😛🤩👍
Wouldn't the bones inside the goose (and a skull in pseudoFabio) have made things impact differently?
Adam Savage for president and only people he has worked with and have had fun with as cabinet and advisors!
I’d love to just watch all these guys “talk shop” and just generally nerd out with each other.
I love the clip of all the super smart people calculating the trajectory speed with complete silences lol
This was so awesome to see you guys and Adam Savage working together!! I had a beaming smile on my face the entire time and some great laughs! Also good to hear Gus' voice haha :)
Holy hell, the collab of the year right here!
we almost lost Adam to liquifaction 😮
The avengers-level crossover I've always dreamed of.
Fantastic 😊
11:42 I know what the next balloon video will be
Adam savage directing his inspired students on safety is great
Pause at 14:34. You're welcome.
The A team!
"If in doubt, blow it out!" I know that's what you were gonna say. LOL
When I wake up in the morning and I step outside. I take a deep breathe
Who knew they sold silicone toys on Bad Chicken?
LOve this video
Seriously- I'm emotional about this.
"Let's find out from these geniuses how fast that went" Adam Savage talking about Dan and Gav XD
Please team up and redo the cement truck! :D
SMG: « it’s not a supersonic goose » Adam Savage: « challenge accepted! »
What a cool opportunity!
14:34 caught me completely off-guard 🤣🤣🤣
we've all seen these kind of "birds" somwhere on the internet 👀
Adam Savage is simply a legend. as a kid i absolutely loved Myth Busters as well cause they were just so entertaining and fun to watch as an adult i cant say anything but my thanks for the awesome time i still have as an adult when rewatching them!
It’s crazy seeing how far they’ve come remembering that i watched them from the first time since i was six (around 2010-2011), and now i’m pushing 20
Glad you guys settled the beef :D
This is my YouTube version of the Avengers
Only thing that woulkd have been better is if Jaime had been there too for that nostalgia
i know an onlyfans  girl who would be interested in that goose ;)
Anyone from the UK over the age 28, does the Fabio head kinda look flesh coloured version of The Head from Art Attack with a terrible blonde wig? Definitely a similar strong jawline and grimace.
When I saw Adam I instantly got nostalgia
Of all the things I've seen J-Lube used for, this is one of them.
Adam with the stereotypical airplane passenger comment, hilarious. 15:50
More crossovers of you and Adam savage would be amazing
The head looks like Jeff Bezos without the hair
Feel like I've been waiting forever for this collab
While this is probably the strangest high-production video I've ever seen anywhere, I am a bit disappointed you didn't give it any spin. It's not like this channel to back away from rifling some feathers.
Birds are quite incredible animals. One racing pigeon was timed at an average of 100 mph, over 400 miles distance (did take even take a rest? ;-). We have some Peregrines,  near us 240 mph they can do. If you put your hand out of a car window at 70 and feel how hard the air is. They are masters at what they do.
That's goose abuse!
"Its hard to aim something so long" "I have tons of experience with that"   Bruh 😂
12:25   The teacher from the Blark and Son show.   God damned spot on
Adam should become an honorary member of the slow mo guys
I mean, this was a collaboration that I think most of us saw coming eventually, or at least hoped. Adam Savage is such an iconic guy, mostly from Mythbusters which was such a sad day when the final episode aired, but was also quite happy to find his Tested youtube channel which I have been enjoying for a few years. If Adam is apart of something, it is normally going to end well, and that doesn't really mean success, just means it will be great.
Hearing Adam count down from 3 takes me back to being a kid watching Mythbusters, what an awesome video
you should have called smarter every day and used his baseball cannon
Love this collab!!
Need more Adam collabs
Is this peak slo-mo?
14:34
Them: Fake Fabio isn't real he can't hurt you Fake Fabio:
So happy to see Bobby Fingers get more recognition
I just got into fishing, and my dumb-ass thought the duck in the thumbnail was a giant minnow-lure 😆
Remember; with enough lube anything will fit anywhere.
We don't deserve a team-up of this magnitude, but I'm so glad we got it.
this feels like small scale Mythbusters. I really missed this ❤
I know you've talked about being a fan of Mythbusters on the channel in the past. I couldn't help but feel so much joy for you getting this experience while I was watching. It's always so wonderful when one gets to meet one of their heros. But to actually do something like this together had to be one of the highest points of your career on YouTube. So happy for you guys!
5:00 if only the metric system existed and you could super easily scale mm/sec into km/h etc... Come on boys.
This brought me straight back to being a kid. I can only imagine the stares I got trying not to burst out with laughter and excitement while I was watching this at lunch. This felt so much like watching a Mythbusters episode. Loved every second of it.
How much does renting those cameras cost?
So is Dan getting Animal lube for GBJ (Giant Balloon June?)
This video (and the project itself) is art.  It isn't the first time you've made art on this channel.  But it might be the most clear-cut "this is art" example.
Boys will be boys 🤣
Somewhere Dan said "and I'm Dan" for no reason at all
This is so much wilder when I have no context for the Fabio goose thing, I googled ir afterwards but the whole concept of the video is like a fever dream lmao
The Collab we didn't know we needed, this is great I can't stop laughing at this.
best collab ever.... just needed Gus there
This video put a huge smile on my face. Love to see Adam and company doing what they love and having fun.
The Adam savage, plus the slowmo guys. Best day ever.
This is a triple collab I would have never dared dream of, but here we are! Just perfect 👌
Pipe is too long guys! You could reach higher speed if shorten the pipe, because you could reach a higher pressure inside the pipe. (less volume - more pressure)
Quality Duck Shots🤘
I feel like doing an absolutely ridiculous and pointlessly silly experiment with Adam Savage is something that’s on everyone’s bucket list. This is a career highlight right here.
I love Bobby Fingers so much. Who the heck are you guys?
I was watching mythbusters on YouTube and thought, "wouldn't it be cool if Adam had a Collab with the slow mo guys".
My childhood has come full circle watch Gavin and dan in middle school for slo-mo water balloon watched myth busters to much
Why didn't you guys invite Fabio to judge the accuracy?
I really loved getting to see the part about establishing safety procedures
ADAM!?!?!?!!
It looks more like a giant butt plug than a goose!
I can't stop laughing! His nose, after that last hit, made him look like a prize fighter for a moment! But even popping his eyes out and blowing off his wig, you couldn't wipe that stupid smile off his face! 😂😂😂
Something I click and enjoy
Now we just need Smarter Every Day's baseball cannon 👀
This Slither remake looks awesome!
Where do I get a bottle of that lube powder?.. Asking for a friend
@16:28 Its a boy 😋
Clickbait 🖕
Adam Savage GOAT!
Wow.. for a second I thought that YT messed up my videocap with Adam in the cap of a Slow Mo Guys video 😅
I hope Fabio sees this.
Good old J-lube! I have the exact same bottle, it is used in many soap bubble recipes!
Funny looking bird. Where can I get one?
Bald Fabio looks eerily similar to Jeff Bezos
Excellent, you guys deserved to meet! I think my favorite part is how damn well Savage projects his voice when doing the range countdowns, that true powered right there!
This feels like watching new age mythbusters, such an amazing video I've been waiting for this collaboration for YEARS! Thanks for making this an amazing Wednesday boys!
How did it feel to be called a genius by THE Adam Savage?
The Fabio head looks like The Head from Art Attack if it was like 25% more disturbing
What did Fabio do to you all?! 🤣
The deadpan "I have her, I have her" absolutely got me 😂😂😂
Looks like a baby seal jumping to the face haha
"bird"
In my opinion, Mythbusters inspired the engineering/STEM  interest renaissance of the mid2000s to now.  They made hard science, accessible, and they made math useful and applicable and FUN.  It wasn’t a classroom, but as the same time they were teaching a LOT, without even intending to.  Nerds have always advanced the world, but the Mythbusters made it fun.
I have now have a deep feeling of sympathy for Fabio that it really happened to him.
I almost spit out my soup in the first ten seconds.
The Avengers of silly projects
So I shouldn't stand up out the limo's sun roof while we're speeding down the freeway?
To think that years down the line, he'd meet everyone's hero in person as an equal
Good thing y’all had slow motion because IRL it didn’t look like much 😂
Ha, I knew Fabio wore a wig!
BILLION DOLLAR COLLAB!
Looks like a new Myth Busters team right there.  Adam Savage is the best.
I'm a big fan of Bobby Fingers, so seeing this video in my sub feed right alongside the one from his channel was a rare treat. And Adam Savage on top of that? A dream come true. Such a fun video, glad this collaboration could come together!
Slo mo guys and Adam savage get together and all they do is shoot a rubber duck into a mannequin head. Boringggggg
Why is a ballistic gel goose covered in animal birthing lube being fired out of a twenty foot air cannon?  No Gav, I never think that. I've grown up watching YouTube.
that fly got obliterated
How dare you two LIVE MY DREAM!!!!! 😭😭😭
Today I Learned - If you  want to loose the goose, you better make sure the tube is lubed.Make of that what you will! Class vid!
Gavin and I are wearing the same shirt right now 😭
you guys should be using "fresh" fish like in the Asterix village fights between the fishmonger and the iron smith... :D:D:D:D:D
Such an incredibly boring and lame real speed test. But the slowmo is hilarious!  The sick side of me wishes you used real (but dead) game birds for the ick factor.
"I'm going to dip the bird in the lube" - Adam Savage
The face at 14:36 and 14:35 are peak. I was cry laughing.
It's close to June again.... Or maybe I'm just a balloon lover? But I think ORBEEZ would look wonderful in balloons and slow-mo
Chinese proverb say that man must wait long time before roast duck fly in mouth.
Aww sweet! This is going to be amazing! 2 of my favorite long-running edutainment creators and also that one guy who keeps making the shockingly high-quality but otherwise totally normal sculpting videos! I don't expect anything weird to happen!
12:28 That literally looks like Matt Parker!
Make art using the same methode. Paintball, white shirts, lots of air & colors. Later, sell the design and donate the money! Gavin can be called Leonardo Ga Vinci and Leonardo Dan Vinci Adam savage-invci?  Good? Excellent!
12:27 WIG SNATCHED
"bird"
Oh my... I haven't watched your vids for 4 years... Time flies... AWESOME CONTENT STILL
Graping blob
What the f...
Dan definitely did a better job on the Malteser- air cannon than Adam did on this one.
Two generations of science goofness😍
I feel like Moss from the IT Crowd "It's too real Roy, its Too real"
One of the all time best crossover episodes
bobby fingers rules dude
wonderful colab! Thanks
Went from fabio to jeff bezos real quick 😂
Brilliant! Funniest thing I’ve seen in years. Never heard of Fabio til now.keep it lubed😂
I’ve recently been binging Mythbusters on YouTube and after seeing an episode with some cool slowmo last night, I was thinking how badly I wanted to see Adam on this channel. And now here we are 😂
Bloody brilliant. Hope there will be more colabs with you guys, Adam and other creators.
it looks like Logan Paul 🤣
That wasn't Mel Gibson's figure being arrested! That Micheal De Santa's!
Adam is such a legend!!!
that does not look like a bird
Did Bobby Fingers and Dan really get into a fight or was that just a skit!? Just watched Bobby Fingers video!
Mmmm what has this channel come to. Happy to have you guy's around.
"Fill the tube with lube." Huh, huh, huh....
Guys, that was a blast, no pun intended!
Dan might be the best in the world at helping people beat Halo 2 LASO on MCC without getting the achievement himself 😂
This sparks immense joy. I'm glad to see all of you guys able to come together and make some hilarious and cool stuff.
TIL: When you slap Fabio really hard he will turn into Jeff Bezos.
Thought it was weird al for a sec
An artist, two slow mo guys, and a myth buster walk into a bar
This was everything I hoped a Slow Mo Guys and Adam Savage video would be.
I sure hope Fabio sees this. He didn’t have a sense of humor about it at the time at all.
These 3 channels together feels like THE new Mythbusters crew.
Probably the least interesting video on this channel 😔
The dream team!
Whats Dan smoking 2:24 ?
What a monumentally beautiful thing to come home to. Collab of the century, and it made me beyond happy. Also I'm going to overindulge my eye holes with Bobby Fingers content now.
So it's safe to assume the fight between Bobby and Dan is more of a bit for his video? Hope that wasn't real.
That was awesome and hilarious.
… is that a bird?
Its so funny Dat rubber face 😂😢😂🤣
I don't know WHY this was entertaining, but it definitely was. lol
Fabio looks like the talking head from Art Attack.
I can feel Dan's jealousy
Love these guys
I thought that was something else in the Thumbnail....
How did you overlook the opportunity to fire a spear out of the cannon into the dummy head and show it here??
Ok, I just have to say I'that m only one and a half minutes in, the intro isn't even over and I'm literally shaking and bowing and awe inspired and becoming moist.
I thought Chris Jericho was in the thumbnail haha
It's so good to see you all having so much fun! :D
Having these three videos all show up in my feed at the same time is one of the greatest gifts I've ever received.
fabio was hit by a goose on a rollercoaster...specifically the goose wasnt on the rollercoaster fabio was, the goose was flying about minding its own business when it was unexpectedly hit by fabios face which was at that time attached to fabio who was sitting on a rollercoaster which was moving at what i would assume to be its regular speed for that section of the rollercoaster ride
not going to lie, that thumbnail suggested a very different projectile..
LOVED THIS VIDEO! Thank you guys! You always make me smile and appreciate science and exploring!
just saying, where AK-50 in slow mo?
that manakin head is definitely danny carey
Adam Savage being all safe, then you have TheBackyardScientist getting shot with a Giant air cannon LOL
pausing at the start where i was asked why im asking about the goose and all that... but that isnt my question..... i wanna know why that dummy head looks like blond Weird Al Yankovic
I mention this incident every time I go to cedar point
0:30 why i have to think here of the blue monday fish in the face meme?
soooo.... someone had to ask... why are you using "cow juice" instead regular oil or grease?
I'm excited for water balloon June again! The way you all recreated the incident from the roller coaster ride is well worth the comparison, it remakes the video we will never get.
and this is what technology delivered to us      GLORIOUS!!!!!
Fobby Bingers, Sadam Avage and the Mow Slo Guys. What a day.
Most I've laughed in a long time. So many great stills from that, must have been hard to choose a thumbnail.
Nearly GIANT BALLOON JUNE 🎈
0:25 Poor Buster.
I didn’t know just how much I needed this collab
Bobby Fingers' own vid about this claims he ended the day by having a fistfight with Dan. Please tell me he's just joking...
That thumbnail made me do a double take
the only thing that would make this video better would have been to have the real Fabio walk on set at the end and ask "what are you guys doing?"
There needs to be a "Fabio reacts" to this video!
That rig to allow the face to absorb a lot of the hit is why you all have 15m subs, most people would just stick it on top of a table
These were some funny shots, chuffed to see such legends working together.  Loved the video!!
Gavin is thriving
That was savage!
I swear Fabio speaks after impact…
Okay, this one had me grinning ear to ear the whole time. 🤣
12:28 Fabio becomes Jeff Bezos
All time hero Adam 🎉
This is my favorite thing
I'm reminded of a line from Top Gear; "We are in fact at the cutting edge of cocking about"
10 years of Mythbusters have prepared Adam for this! 😂😂😂
Mythbusters and their animal birthing lube are a classic duo.
Destin from the YouTube channel smarter every day made a supersonic baseball air cannon. That would be interesting to see in slo-mo
WHAAAAT !?!?!?!? ADAM?!?!?!
Adam Savage and the Slow Mo guys?  My life is complete.
So what skills have you learned that you never expected to need again and then ended up being unexpectedly useful?
Any Pattern Recognition fans?
"Any cows need to be born here we can help!" ... or giving birth to Dan out of a giant balloon?
Thank God for the Mythbusters. My all time favorite show on television.
This was so cool and saw all these guys. So fun
That fight looked quite real 😮
No clue who that Fabio guy is or why you are throwing birds at his face but I am happy to see Adam Savage after so many years, I have not watched Mythbusters since 2011 or something
I hope there's slow mo footage of the fight.
This is such a crossover of two things I absolutely love, I cannot wait for more! Oh my gosh! ❤
Nice uhaul
Guys will see this and be like "hell yeah" and I'm guys.
YES FINALLY ADAMS BACK WITH THE SCIENCE EXPERIMENT this might be my most favorite episode of all time !!!!!!
Slow mo guys and tested should start a co series
Oh my god. What the hell.
Adam and Jamie were the original slo mo guys. This collaboration is well over due.
And the sloppy joes shirt. Regulation listener and comment leaver checking in.
"goose"
I’ve been waiting for so long for this and I’m so happy it finally happened.
You didn't need Adam, but I know people fawn over TV personalities... Mythbusters fell out of favor for me when it became evident that it was more about saying "we did this crazy thing", rather than spend time on controlling more variables to get better data. Then they would bother saying "Definitively", even when it was obvious that there were a dozen loose ends unaccounted for, although the unique premise kept me coming back. I don't miss those guys, neither are very good hosts for TV despite the "I'm a nerd" excuses they would make for themselves, The Slow Mo guys are much better presenters than Adam..
now you just need Destin and my life is complete.
Fabio looks a bit like Pyro, i swear
6:10 😑 Well, it isn't difficult if it is hard.
I wonder if Fabio can laugh at this now. I hope he sees this!
It just HAD to specifically be a goose, didn't it... As if we don't have a bad enough rap as it is!
SUS
12:47 feels like a group shot in a heist film 😂😂
If I’ve said it once I’ve said it 1000 times “it’s all fun and games until somebody finds an eye“
I loved mythbusters, awesome to see this collab
Definitely a demonstration of why flared bases are important 🤣
I love how it looks like Fabio's crying at 11:15.
My worlds are colliding
You have that moment of wtf are we doing. At 10:05 I had that feeling: Wtf am I watching and why is this so entertaining. GG
One of the best!!!
How could you *not* zip-tie a fabio head onto the end of the air cannon & insta-inflate it?
15:19😂😂😂
J lube gets sticky real quick. You guys should have gone with a silicone based lube. Stays slippery all the time =)
Give him a little goose to the face... All the better to meet Jaysus with.
Adam building the cannon brings back memories of MythBusters. They should've got buster here as well. RIP Grant
Hell yea Bobby Fingers shoutout!
@3:25 fabio turned into a blob fish 😂😂....blobio 😅😂
Adam riding the onehweel is sick!
This is truly one of the greatest YouTube crossovers.
Fabio!?! I thought that was supposed to be Weird Al Yankovic
I love the math break where everyone is stating off into space doing math.
Adam makes everything better. It's like seeing your favorite grandparent when yer feeling under the weather.🎉❤🙏
lmao everyone doing math for minute was hilarious
Poor Brent from Goobertown Hobbies...
Was the fight with Dan and Bobby Fingers real? Lmao what an epic collab
09:06 look at those chemtrails! terrible stuff
LUBE! THAT! GOOSE!
It turned in to Weird Al 🤣🤣
I am convinced that Adam has just stopped aging, he has surpassed the need for age and has become an eternal, jolly being.
Bobby Finger’s bezos video is a contender for best YouTube video of all time
Thumbnail looks like a blonde Weird Al being smacked with a... Um let's say sausage
Why does it sound like you guys were in a constant storm
That wobbly, floppity, slimy goose reminded me of my ex, but…never mind. On another note: Dan, you’re looking trim and quite urbane! 😊 Thanks for a very…unusual viddy, lads!
Did anyone else think Adam was cleaning his shoe in the lube?
This is the funniest video you've ever made
we need Adam to remake the infamous Chicken Chicken so we can get a frozen/thawed bird into an aircraft windshield at like 1.5 million frames per second, i need this in my life.
Something to do I spose
What a laugh that was to have slow mo guys, Adam savage in one video you guys need to make more of them.
head looks like Bryan Johnson de-aged a tiny bit more!
"Get me a man who can fire a precision jelly goose out of a drain pipe." "....Adam Savage?" "Adam Savage. Exactly What I was thinking."
It is very touching how the doll remains smiling and with a positive attitude, even after countless shots
So next up salmons?
This is a rad episode...
The number of sex jokes in this adam savage special is uncountable
You guys need to colab more!
How is this only a 16 minute video.  It should have been an hour long special!
What a team up 😅
Hearing Adam Savage laughing is always awesome! I miss those Mythbuster days.
5:11 I am surprised they were surprised that a BIRD shaped object is very aerodynamic
Adam Savage!!!!
Y?
Ok, now do Dan!!
This is a superb bit of history. More!
13:15 That guy was trading 1 emerald for 64 diamonds
Adam cosplaying as Heisenberg is the best part.
Jeff Bezos
ive had that lube used on myself :3
14:35 is one of the most horrifying shots this channel has had so far
Loved this video. It was the first of the trio for me. Shame the Mythbusters motto did carry over to this tho of “if it’s worth doing, it’s worth Over doing.” lol. I would’ve Loved to have seen a cobra chicken come out at mock speeds slamming into something once all the premise experiments were done. Maybe an idea for a follow up show lol😂😂🧡🙌🦢💥💀🤓😜😁🫶  Also, after watching Bobby’s video, 🫤did he really get into a fight with Dan or was that just a bit and his style of humor?
that section of 3/4 ish pipe is too much of a restriction, it can go faster
Seeing a Slow Mo Guys and a Tested video side by side on my home page and realizing they are related is the coolest thing ever.
Do. Not. Break. The. Adam. Savage. 15:00
Nice to see Adam doing this kind of thing again!
Giving credit where it's due... Fabio never blinked once.
Hot Shots Part Deux vibes
Gav and Adam? My two favorite celebrities? Perfection.
This is the safest I have ever seen Adam behave. I think he’s one of those guys who is happy to risk his own life for no reason at all… but he will never allow anyone else to be in danger. Big dad energy.  Edit: guys. I am talking about his safety record on his personal YouTube channel, Tested, not Myth Busters. He is pretty notorious for ignoring best practices there. Obviously, on a full production TV show they had safety requirements, insurance, and entire teams there to keep people safe and protect their assets. It’s legally required and financially smart. I’m talking about what he does on his own time. I have never seen him put others at risk ever, and he’s more than welcome to decide what level of risk he’s willing to take for himself. He’s always been a “do as I say, not as I do” guy. As I said in my original comment, he never allows anyone else to be in danger.
the sloppy joes tee
I appreciate Adam's dedication to safety and I like that the rules he sets prior to any testing were included in the video.
The one head looks like Weird Al!
God I hate this face.
I never knew those were "birds". My wife has one of those in her night stand. 😅
I wish Adam could have been on every video
NGL, when I saw the thumbnail and "Bird to the Face" in the title I thought you were going to be shooting something else...
Good job!👍
Goose... Bird...  Ye right.
Google doesn't give me anything on Steven Seagal getting slammed. Please help
The first scene was very nsfw 😂
10:40 The opacity of the gel seems to change as it impacts and deforms.
I’m a sucker, I see Adam Savage, I click. Bonus for being a SLO-Mo guys video on top of that!
12:26 jeff bezos??
Did anyone else notice the fly that landed  @12:51 and got obliterated by the bird?
What a crossover!
Adam Savage on Slow Mo Guys? I am so happy right now
Does anyone know if this channel is sticking around? Since their parent company is shut down now will Slo Mo Guys continue???
Netflix: are you still watching? Someones Daughter: 8:41
Really happy you left in Adam’s safety briefing. He hinted on it in his video, but it was lovely to see him in action.
Love the slow mo slaps 😂
Love this crossover.
Guess I was lucky with a glancing blow to the forehead by a duck while cycling at about 30 km/h.
Many things were said in this video that very few people will have ever heard before. However, I doubt most of us who've been here a while are really surprised by any of them...
Slo Mo Guys x Mythbusters  The collab I’ve always wanted.
This might be the best collab yet, im sorry to every other collab, but daum this one is funny 😂
It didn't hit his face. The goose hit the video camera and a shard his his nose.
"You may be thinking to yourself... Why is a ballistic gel goose covered in animal birthing lube being fired out of a 20 ft air cannon?"  Nope. That's a typical Saturday for me.
Remember kids, the only difference between science and messing around is writing it down.
12:28 turned him from Disney prince to Jeff Bezos pretty quick.
I thought this was a Bad Dragon collab
i like how there was this long intro for Bobby and then it was just like "and here's Adam Savage" lmao
that sloppy joes shirt though.
bobby is a really strange guy
Having seen what a malteser from an air cannon did to a ping pong bat, good on Adam for being so clear about not stepping in front of that thing.
That's the face of a man who can't believe it's not butter.
The crossover episode the world needed the most.
I grew concerned when i heard "Fabio, " "lube," and "rubber goose". I grew even more concerned when Adam Savage showed up. 🤣   Awesome video, folks. Was a great 3 way collaboration.
that doesn't look much like a birb in the thumbnail btw
It's the collab we all wanted, but didn't think we needed... banger of a video guys.
High art to be sure. 🤣
Man this episode-- er, video, made me feel like I was a teen again.  Can't believe it's been 21 years since Mythbusters first aired.  Adam hasn't changed at all.
this is my childhood in one video.... me happy
Such a good collaboration
In the thumbnail, that...bird...looked like something else to me, not gonna lie. >.>
Wait is Dan the Adam Savage of Slow Mo Guys?
That doll looks like Jeff Bezos without the wig.
Twooooo weeeeeks
Why does this look like yo mama's toy
Dude!
my least fav myth busters episode is the one where they fling chickens at windows and didn't understand why it was a bad idea to use a FROZEN chicken, and why that was completely unrealistic a test....glad it's something squishy
This is the best cross over ever I love Adam Savage
How wonderful is it to watch Adam in action?! This is the collab I've been dreaming of since I watched your first few videos!
The most insane collaboration. A holy trinity, if you will. (This is of course if you consider The Slow Mo Guys to be one singular entity).
Too much sexual without being sexual 🤣🤣
If you watch all the videos this is like watching a full episode of mythbusters. i've been smiling like a little kid all morning watching these.
Adam Savage is just "tested" now?
the best bird into the best fabio made him look like something from monster factory.
that's what she said, that's what she said
Adam Savage? The legend himself? Amazing. His safety talk was great.
Adam savage is a poser!
adam savage, legendary extraordinaire :)
This is the best video on the channel.
Bobby Fingers is the best channel on YouTube
Dan, Gav, Adam & Bobby! Talk about a motley crew! Terrific video! 👍👍
Bobby has one of the best YouTube channels ever made
With out the hair it looked like Jeff Bazos
I thought they were shooting it at Weird Al
SO MUCH CALCULATING!!!
What an awesome collaboration 👏❤️👏👏👏
So good. This channel always delivers. Really awesome seeing you guys collab with Adam Savage. I hope to see more with him!
I had no idea this was a slow mo guys video from the thumbnail
Did Bobby Finders absolutely wreck Dan?
Did Dan actually get into a fight with Bobby or was that just some shenanigans for his video?
Damn, Adam on SlowMoGuys, yeeesssss
I wish the lube had some color to it so we could see the impact after it was over.
adam looks like he's in his natural environment
That was a graphic first shot! 😂
It should be more power to be cool
Love these very smart dudes proving all the teachers of my generation going “you won’t have a calculator in your pocket!” Wrong haha.
video starts at 7:39
I absolutely love this Slow Mo Guys and Adam Savage crossover, including the how did we get here discussion!
adam savage and slow mo guys :O
Felt like watching a mini mythbusters episode, But no myth busting
Our boi Dan looks like he's cutting a bit.   Working on that beach bod! Looking quite fit bud!
Was I the only one that thought it was the head of Jeff Spicoli from Fast Times? 😆
It looked more like a flying seal
Is that suppose to be Fabio? Lol
I love it when yall dont clickbait with adam, hes just... In the video, and its a suprise for us
Why are you guys working with Adam Savage? He literally had to pay his sister a settlement because he sexually assaulted her, and anybody who wouldn't vaccinate or wear a mask he called an idiot, An actively pushed vaccinations and masks on the population, wow, I lost all respect for this channel. 😢 Been a fan since y'all were part of achievement hunters, not anymore, peace out.
And today I learned that Fabio was hit by a bird while on a rollercoaster.
I was actually out on track testing some new tyres today in my kart.  Back straight a bird flew into my chest, thing literally exploded at 110kmh
Can't help but admire Adam. For all the stuff he has done over the many years, he can still find immense fun and joy of 'simply' shooting a silicon goose out of an air cannon. Got to love the energy and enthusiasm.
Adam just being his Savage Self  😂😂😂😂 this is FANTASTIC
even with out the mask I instantly recognized Bob from The Rubberbandits.
That side shot turned Fabio into Jeff Bezos!
That looks like Weird Al not Fabio 😂
This episode is perfection. On that note, I want more!
now that is a dream collab, could have only been better if Jamie was there as well^^
You can really tell how happy adam was. It's almost like he was reliving his days on Mythbusters. We need more adam!
There's something so beautiful and so human about putting an enormous amount of time and effort into something really stupid
Might be my definite favorite video. Some of my favorite people doing something extraordinary.
The crossover we needed!
I want to see ballistic gel bird vs realistic ballistic gel head.
This healed me on a spiritual level 😁
Thats probably one of the most disturbing things ive seen in a while.. good job gentlemen
14:33 damn Fabio turned in to Grug Crood for a second there lol
That's a cool moment you got to share with Adam Savage, having watched Mythbusters for so long. You'll have a similar moment one day, but with someone who has been watching these videos for years, and can't believe they're working with you.
Need a much wider connecting pipe between tank and barrel, and a bigger/fast-action valve.
The first duck and fabio looked like it wasn't that good. But the slow mo was BRILLIANT! I really laughed 😂
Man I miss the Mythbusters!
@tested could you build a machine to simulate an instantaneous underwater implosion? Might need a hydralic press and a little submarine model. 🤔
This is an instant classic - a Mount Rushmore of a collaboration. More, please!
you need a new employer right? Maybe the slow mo guys just join tested
That seems like a better than average day. Nice job!
Adam collabing with gav and dan results in a mythbusters revival.
This just might be the weirdest thing I've seen in slow motion
Man, Adam’s laugh is still contagious as hell😂
Is there anything better than men just dicking around?
what a stupid waste of time
This was amazing
The sound in this video is giving me AIDS
Kinda wanna see what a pressure tank looks like when you over fill it
13:11 Spot on. You got the little fly.
I never really thought about a Tested/Slow Mo Guys collaboration before, but it is exactly what I needed to see.
I love the safety briefing!
lets be fair now, its Adam Savage from Tested. Much better!
Just to hear Adam counting down from 3 then doing something crazy took me back years. Mr. Savage and the Slo Mo guys! It's like a dream come true :)
Ha, i was telling my colleague about this moment recently, remember March 30th! I found out recently though, that the bird did not actually hit his face, the bird splattered against the camera rig that was placed in front of Fabio, and some parts of it hit his face instead. I mean, i love birds, but this is still a legendary moment in time.
I never heard about that incident with Fabio and the bird.
You know you hit peak professional stupidity when you have the GOAT Adam Savage on your channel 🤣❤
These are the types of co-labs that dreams are made of!
That dummy looks like Jeff Bezos without the hair 😂
Gav,Dan,and Adam,y'all rock! Peace
The collab I never could think would happen! BOBBY IS A BLODY LEGEND 🦵
Mr Savage, there’s a goose in your lube tube…
You can freeze this vid at any point as long as the shot is of Fabio and I'm laughing my ass off.
you being friends with Gus Sorola is awesome, sad to know Red vs Blue is about to be done for good.
This collab between the slo mo guys and my childhood hero adam savage from mythbusters is a genuine dream come true for me. I can only hope it isn't the last one.
"It's hard to aim something so long" "I've had tons of experience with that"  💀🤣
More of this, this was funny!
This is a certified “How Did We Get Here?” moment.
too bad you guys didnt put googly eyes on the birb
Favorite part; everyone trying to do math and failing.
I haven't laughed that hard in a LONG time, I was actually coughing cause I was laughing so hard. This is the kind of collab I love to see, everyone having fun doing what they enjoy doing.
I’ve always wanted to do this to Fabio. 😂😂
I love the last moments of the final shot where Fabio looks so similar to Arnold from Total Recall...
Nice to see adam still as childlike as ever
Just watched the incident and Fabio saying it could happen again to anyone. Hasnt happened to anyone since 1999 lol
Okay, but.... why?
Dream team!
This video is gonna get demonetized. 😂
There are two types of people when it comes to the thumbnail, those that the internet has ruined and thought something else was flying at Fauxbio's face and liars.
I had a surreal moment just watching this like how did I get here
one of the craziest collabs ever
Interesting fact for all european fans: thats about 120 kilometres per hour.
I was there waiting in line for that coaster when Fabio took that bird to the face. Sadly I didn't get to see anything but Slow Mo Guys will fill in the blanks for me.
What a Dream Team!
4:12 Adam knew exactly when the compressor would kick in XD
Adam Savage is my favorite person ever
Thought I opened a tested video when I saw Adam and had to recheck the title  Also, thumbnail made me think of Weird Al
The silicone head looks more like Sharlto Copley
I think that's the fastest I've ever clicked on a video or clicked like the moment I saw Adam Savage.
I like Dan in this video too. He knows his job would be to be Fabio in this video, so eating biscuits is probably better
This is one of those videos that deserves 20 million view’s
This was superb.
I know how Michael Scott would have replied to that . 6:12
Really cool i love to hear a pressure tank fill up for an entire video
I'm so happy seeing Adam on this channel
12:12 Fabio  12:30 Will Forte
Lame
Bobby's a genius, pure and simple.
that thumbnail though....
I found one of these!  But, why is my mom testing rubber geese?
“He took a duck in the face at 250 knots.”
Bald Fabio just looks like Jeff Bezos
Honestly you guys this is some of the best
0:51 Why does he look like Michael from GTAV?
This must be guy humour lol
Truly inspirational.
The fight with fab and Dan lol
I can't believe it's not bird.
that bird looks odd...😂😂
Ouch, flashback to my childhood.  In an estate  car back seat late seventies, it was early morning i had the window down when i felt a sharp pain in my head, touched my head and my hand was covered in blood !.   My dad stopped the car examined me but couldn't  find a cut ????   When we reached home we unloaded the car only to find a dead Blackbird in the boot.    It flew in the window died on impact with me and flopped in the back, all i had was a big bruise above my ear and a cool story for school the next day.
This has to be the ultimate trifecta of silly, outright hilarious and inappropriate all at the same time. I have no words to express how entertaining this was
0:00 Oh ohh ,  Nice Surprise 😎
"Mark my word's.  This will happen again!"   Omg it happened again!!!
Turns out Dan can aim Geese and guns xD
Did anyone remind Adam to not have another cannonball event? Could you imagine the news story if a lubed up goose crashed through someone's house?
0:35 I thought 'what is Jake Gyllenhaal doing in this video??' Lmao, it took my some seconds to unsee him
This gives such old mythbusters vibes absolutely love it
I'll be honest, watching Adam Savage explain a certain type of animal lube to The Slow Mo Guys was the last thing I expected to see today.
having a whole explanation about how bobby fingers is involved and then also adam savage is just here
Funny, Adam Savage is a legend
love you guys
Felt like a happy kid watching this!
Bobby Fingers!!
Always happy to see Adam Savage in a desert
Someone put a lave on Adam. His Mythbuster days are showing XD. Best collab in history and I thought How ridiculous was heavenly excellent!
Two things I want to point out:   1: you know damn well what you were doing with that thumbnail 😂  2: when I saw Adam Savage I got confused for a second. Thought I was seeing an episode of mythbusters.  What a great pleasure to see him working with you guys! (Or you guys working with him, whichever. :P) Not a collab i ever imagined, but it was a match made in Heaven!   Definitely enjoyed this!
Electrical supply houses will sell you a bucket full of wire pulling lube. Then you don’t have to make it…
Fabio turned into Weird Al @10:48
❤
ADAM SAVAGE???  Dude this has so much mythbusters energy I LOVE this
I'm imagining the Endgame of YT creator vids.  Gav and Dan standing next to Adam when over the walkie comes .. "On your left" Destin, Backyard scientist, Xyla Foxlin, Colin Furze, Hacksmith, Rober, Electro boom, and Nilered all step out of portals.  "Creators.... Assemble!"
I love how much Dan is just hanging around Adam completely jealous that he's getting to do all the dangerous fun stuff
Gav, that sound design on the bird coming out of the cannon was actually grim.
The thumbnail kind of looked like a…… never mind
You all were _this_ close to actualizing the joke of finding out the air speed velocity of an unladen Swallow. Sure, there's a few caveats here and there but still.
I'm making a prediction right now, that Dan + lube + giant balloon will result in a horrifying illustration of "unbirth" and if he manages it, there's gonna be at least one case "rebirth" as the balloon's elasticity rejects him.
I would like to say what i thought the red item at the end looked like, but there's a strong possibility kids will read this. 😆
Great minds think alike!, i saw Adam and said YES!
My condolences on your recent loss on the presidential race... I've always believed that the people who don't want power are the best ones to trust with it... The current president is cool. but I don't know if I trust the secretary with the books...
https://youtube.com/shorts/O2vtrKDr2dc?si=nWX1f6bMk_gXAVUv  For people who didn't get the context like me.
The dummy looks like wierd al lol
From riding horses outside to making slow mo guy videos with Adam Savage. Fair play Mr.Chrome ❤️
Bird. Bird. Bird.
That’s not Fabio, that’s Danny Carey from TOOL.
This made my day, and its still early!  Thanks Adam, Bobby, Dan, and Gav!!!!!!
Please if you ever get a chance film a Slow Mo of a BLEVE! please!
I really appreciate how Gav seemed to kind of adopt Bobby fingers surreal laid back narration style a little bit for this video.
This is truly one of the best combos imaginable
amazing collaboration
I must be in some kind of deranged version of Heaven. Adam Savage and the Slo Mo Guys working together?
Nah, I am fabio 😭
no shirtless dan today? 🙁
My favorite part was the math 😂
Adam Savage Like!
I should call her...
peak
Adams iconic laugh, man you guys are so lucky. Bet this shoot was a.......blast lol.
The guy getting hit kinda looks like weird Al
Deuteronomy!
Adam Savage and the Slo Mo Guys at last!!
I have to admit I didn't think that was actually a bird in the thumbnail. Really looked like something else ...
adam savage!!! the legend!!!!
What a great team up, myth busters reborn ??????
Looks more like the drummer from Tool...
When the eye pops out it turns into gavin for a moment
😂 should have just got a bottle of astroglide😂😂😂
More with adam
If Savage is in it, it is going to be unwatchable.
Marvelous to see Adam doing a Mythbusters type of thing on your channel!! I laughed until I cried seeing the bird hitting the face slo mo!
12:53 might be the best freeze frame ever.
This is a moment in time that would have been exceedingly unlikely if it weren't for the internet.
Cement truck explosion please! Filmed with the new hotness.
NO WAY
5:15 there's something very satisfying about hearing people with decades more education than me, commenting on how aerodynamic the goose is.
Alright...  Hear me out...
This collaboration makes my heart happy.
Bobby fingers is one of the weirdest but best mixed media artists. Makes the process of physical art into an art of it's own
He looked like the jurassic park weird al music video right after the impact
Never heard of bobby fingers - he's a ray of sunshine now isn't he.
When Adam said he was thrilled about doing this, I immediately thought of you, Gav, and knew how chuffed you were. This was a fun one.
People who recognize that lube who aren’t farmer or veterinarians be sweating right now.
Waitwhat?  You had Adam Savage and you didn't put that in the title or thumbnail???  Okay, I guess you do mention "tested", but that's not anywhere near as eye catching.
Awersome Project with such a great team. MORE PLS
Great collab! Adam's laugh is contagious ❤
What a collab
did not expect gus to pop up, lol! pleasant surprise :)
That face is creepy beyond all else.
Seeing Adam Savage in a crazy science video absolutely slammed me back in time to being a little kid and binging hours of Mythbusters
8:40 No, no, I didn't say 'choke on a duck' Siri
I LOVE the Adibisi shirt. I want one so bad!!!
That lube powder is the same stuff that those useless chodes on Whale Wars were throwing at the Nisshin-Maru whaling vessels to make their decks slick.
Adam Savage and Gavin Free, two people who, combined, are responsible for almost all the entertainment in my life. Unreal. Amazing collab.
You know it’s gonna be a good one when Savage is here
It looks like he's enjoying it.
Oh. My. God!  Slow Mo Guys, Bobby Fingers, and Adam Savage in one video?  What is this world?
Where's the footage of the fight at Rudy's!?!
Didn't realize until the wig flew off that it's actually a Jeff Bezos mask
The first one looked like Fabio was taking an otter to the face, the second one changed his name to Isiah.... coz he ended up with one Isiah than the other 🤣
Absolute high quality nonsense, full of fun and extremely better than any expectation...
bald Fabio is Bezos
Oh my God. This is like.... holy trinity level of collaboration. So happy to see ALL OF YOU
The kid named Bobby:
For a brief moment I thought you were shooting Weird Al Jankovic
saw the thumbnail and went "a bird huh... 🤨" immediate click though. have never seen a bird like that fly
Adam was my childhood hero, Mythbusters was and still is one of my favourite shows. My YouTube universe is colliding.
Those eye popping out give me total recall vibes🤣😂
'Fabio's' face expression at 14:35 is absolutely beautiful :D
That might be some of the best slow mo guys clips ever
These Slow Mo Crossovers always hit me where I live!
The real questions was the fight real?
The mother of all invention is the phrase “you know what would be funny…?”
My mom was actually working at busch gardens when this happened to fabio
Bobby's like the secret main character of youtube. He knows everybody, his vids are more high-effort than some people's entire channels, and whenever he makes a project, EVERYONE gets great videos out of it.
J-Lube is also popular among those who regularly host large... adult gatherings.
that tanks outlet pipe diameter is too small
"Fire the test goose" is NOT a phrase I was expecting to hear today.  Amazing.
YEEEEEES !!!!!!!!!!
I took a 50MPH duck to the chest (motorcycle).  Almost knocked me off my motorcycle and left a massive bruise on my chest even through protective gear.  Even the wing left a streak on my left arm from the wing.  Those things will do some damage, I can attest to that without even seeing the video!
Okay, why does that doll head look like Conan O'brien.
He's doing my job :D
Adam Savage and Slow Mo Guys! YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
6:12 dan didn't disserve that 😭
12:55  anyone elses eye hurt?
The bird wiggling through the air like an amoeba or a giant slime mold! 😂
14:34 is just wild
People discovering birds are aerodynamic
Bobby Fingers’ channel is about to go stratospheric. It feels like cosmic justice. His is quite possibly the best channel on YouTube. Objectively speaking.
Adam unconditionally loves science so much his jokes and quips are science based I love it lmao😂
he gets his chicken cannon back
years ago on a school trip i watched 2 pigeons hit the same classmate in the face in a 1 week span. i havent seen it before and not since, and i will never forget it
Adam`s "Its best when they are unconscious" made me spew coffee in my keybord!
Hey guys, for future projects that require aiming across a long open distance, where there might be too much light for laser levels, you should try water in a clear house the water at both ends of the hose will be level at rest, just match up the centerline of the barrel and the target with the water level at both ends of the hose
Loading a pipe with a goose, is surreal statement by it self :D
Most absurd thing I've seen in a long time.
now, did you remember to write it down?
what a... foul video
oh my god this is the collab we've all been waiting YEARS to see! Brilliant!
please let this reignite adam's passion for mythbusting. life hasn't been the same since it ended.
Dan appears to only own one shirt and one coat
yes
I’ve gotta say it’s weird but my favorite parts of these videos is the safety measures you always go through, it’s nice knowing you take everything seriously
I like how the slow mo footage of the goose hitting his face for first time was 2 separate shots. Like really? You messed that up editors???
oh boy we need a whole series with adam savage and slow mo guys now
Wish Bobby wasn’t so depressed about filming w my fav youtubers
"It's just best if they're unconscious." What a very Adam thing to say.
The Collab no one ever thought about but damn if it ain't great content.
The eyeballs popping out is crazy!
The Thumbnail though 😂
I am thinking, actually, gooey goose not withstanding, there is an Adam Savage in the shot ... have to put this on the big screen
Disturbing and beautiful at the same time. Bravo!
How has this idea not been it's own channel for years already. Adam + Slow Mo Guys
The “martini” shot 😂😂😂
Can't believe how far Gav and Dan have come to be doing this sort of thing with the legendary Adam Savage. So cool.
13:03 looks like he has the same nose as Gav!
BOBBY!!!!!
If you trace it back, Adam Savage in a quarry is the primogenitor of probably more than 90% of the best stuff on youtube
This is the team up I’ve been WAITING for, and I didn’t even know it 😂😂😂😂😂
Adam on this channel is just perfect. You should collab more
Always love that you include the little behind the scenes snippets
Uncanny Quarry
THAT'S SOME BIRD YOU GOT THERE SIR.
All you need  is a giant gourd of lube.
Under a better coach, someone prepared to actually help players learn, Kehrer would have learnt the leaghe and position and everything required. Moyes was never that man.
If I comment here instead of on the Regulation Pod channel, does that still make me a comment leaver?
Great fun! Don't miss Bobby Fingers films. He's a seriously talented (and entertaining) artist. :)
That was... fowl.
The collab we didn't know we needed!!
Adam Savage turning to you to check if the camera was ready must've been like living a dream! It would've been for me - I wanted to be a Mythbuster so bad back then, hell, I still do lol
BRO ADAM SAVAGE AND BOBBY FINGERS? LETS GO
This was definately a fun episode but we need heavier objects and less rigid head models lol I wanna see that thing explode!
So happy yall collaborated with Adam Savage I grew up watching myth busters.
The one guy kinda sounded like jack sparrow 😂
Now THATS fast food!  lol
A bobby fingers colab?!
This is what it's all about. just some folks coming together to have a fun time
The ultimate home defence weapon the goose cannon
The mechanical coupling between the bird and the face....  I need this on a t-shirt.
15 + min of Fabio taking D to the face......sure.....whatever.
Slow Mo Guys?  Bobby Fingers?  Adam Savage?!  This is a good day.
I love how more than a decade after Mythbusters aired on German TV, Adam keeps popping up on channels I follow. Man's a treasure.
The bust went from Fabio to FaABiOoo
All good!
👀 Sloppy Joes shirt
You might wanna double-check that thumbnail before it gets flagged.
I can't be the only one that thinks that looks like a s*xtoy?
THIS MIGHT BE MY FAVORITE COLLAB OF ALL TIME
Can't believe these amazing characters have met, my childhood and adulthood in one video. PLS MORE OF DIS
This video is pure example of wastage of resources, money and such brains.. what and why we need this video... instead make somthing spectacular which is more challenging to make and understand.
This is best thing I've seen in a long time.
Adam Savage meets The Slow Mo Guys? Heaven, I'm in heaven And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak ...  😃
I didnt think it was that typa bird
it was awesome to see adam and the slow mo guys finally collaborate. i hope this is the first of many.
It feels like I'm watching these videos in fast-motion....before I can even think about what is going on, the video is half over!.  Great stuff.
I dont think you realise how long ive been waiting for Adam savage and The slowmo guys
Animal birthing lube to launch geese into Fabio. I can’t believe it’s not butter!
Another great video.    Years ago a bird flew into my face while traveling 60mph on a rural road on a motorcycle.  It's a very shocking experience.  Was probably for the bird also.   It was great fun riding 50 miles back home covered in bird blood and other fluids.  Got a lot of strange looks for some reason.
We almost lost Adam to quicksand.
It's here, the crossover.
MAN i just realized the head they are  shooting at is the one From Art Attack. this is the same face just diffrent hair XD
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Bro, this collab? Oh my god <3
"Goose"
Awesome episode. Awesomeness
Now I really hope you’ll do more projects with Adam in the future!😁
❤ watching Adam`s shows for 21 years now! And Bobby is a true Genius ❤
I’m gonna be honest, this is one of the few episodes where the results look absolutely boring at normal speed.
that goose turned the head into Brian Peppers at 14:34
I love Slomo guys - Can't stand Adam Savage who is a paid liar.
The thumbnail 😂
0:14 "You may be thinking to yourself, 'Why is a ballistic gel goose covered in animal birthing lube being fired out of a twenty-foot air canon?'"  No. I already saw that Adam's in the video. I'm not going to question something like a goose-canon at this point.
Just looking at the thumbnail I knew instantly this was about fabio. Hadn't thought about that incident in over a decade.
The first shot looked like Adam loading a mortar with a grenade...
I dont know why... but whats in the thumbnail doesnt look like a bird.
I own birds. Can confirm, it hurts.
WHAT A COLLAB!!!
This is the best thing I've seen all year, a collaboration waiting to come true for a long long time
Gotta love it it's science that makes you laugh. Have to say though, if the movie The Abyss featured scenes like this (from 12:50)  it would have given it a whole new meaning 🤣🤣🤣
"Best if theyre unconscious" 😅😂
give me Adam Savage x Slow Mo Guys whenever possible and I'm happy
Amazing!
Lets goooo
medical insurance billing codes use what called ICD10. in there is the code: ICD10 W61.62 for Struck by duck. Fabio is covered
Instant classic
YES BOBBY FINGIES GETTING THE RECOGNITION HE DESERVES THANK YOU
Now I know that Adam Savage knows about Slop O'Clock... wild.
I can safely say that when I saw it, I did not think "ballistic gel goose" but the narration helped.
Untitled goose game has really gone too far
Hearing Adam from @tested shouting “In 3, 2, 1!” It took me back more than a decade to the time when I was watching MythBusters on Discovery Channel.  Greetings from Colombia.
these shots are horrendeous, stupid and horrible to look at - in other words: I love this video so much, I completely lost it the entire time 😂  So much fun - and Adam radiates pure Joy
Why does Adam Savage being around ALWAYS make things better?!
I wonder if you can shoot that also using Destin's Team's baseball cannon?
I'm a simple man. I see a collab between @tested and anyone, or between The Slow Mo Guys and anyone, I like the video before watching it.
S almost water balloon June!
Amazing. YouTube legends are in awe of TV legend. 🙄 You guys are all three of you right up there! 😂
12:12 from Fabio to Jeff Bezos
ADAM!!!!!!!!
I laughed so hard I cried
Even that rubber face had expression of: "What the hell?" Love it :D
Fabio: "I can't believe it wasn't butter" 😳
14:33
Oh this is such a great episode.
Not so pretty now, is he? but... for real... why? I know you explained it, kinda... but I need more context
The thumbnail was like umm.....i don't even know what i feel when i saw
It feels like the starts aligned for this one, even though it's not the most explosive or dangerous things you've filmed. Two wonderful guests, the expression on the the dummy, nice weather, not too much troubleshooting (unless it was edited out).
Dan lost weight!
I'm digging Bobby's Oz t-shirt!!!
I’ve been thinking of saying something about another “ the slow-mo show, just hear me out.   The slow-mo show with Adam savage, it has a ring to it, dose it not? 😍😊
Sadly the bobby guy was kinda weird and had to show everyone how manly and unfazed he is, If it was ironic, the message didnt really go through..  but otherwise, i love seeing adam and the slow mo guys, dream team!
They knew what they are doing with that thumbnail
What even is that thumbnail
Gav- "Why is a ballistic gel goose, covered in birthing fluid, being fired from an air cannon?"  Me- "That's a Goose?!"
That’s not a bird…
Adam Savage brings me endless amounts of joy <3 hes a treasure  grew up watching Mythbusters and subbed to his youtube channel since I found it his excitement is contagious
I find the size of your air valve disappointing. It was on Mythbusters nearly 20 years ago that I first heard of pilot assisted air valves, that Adam and Jamie used to shoot things at things.
That Ballistic Gel Goose like very close to something else I just can't quite put my finger on it 🤔
I love Adam Savage
This is like the avengers meeting up. It feels amazing to see so many talented people together
Brunettes have a pathologically jealous of Blondes.
This is is the second time this week that Fabio’s goose has made it into my feed.
6:58 "lets stop talking about ourselves and shoot some geese" *cuts to the most sincere VO gavin has ever done on the channel*
It's finally happening!!!!
Wait wait wait wait wait.  Dan got into a fist fight with Bobby Fingers, and you DIDN'T film it in slow motion?!
BALLISTIC CHICKEN
13:07 Fabio turned into Gavin
Is it sacrilege that I watch this show at 1.5x?
"Goose" 😂 yeah okay
I watched Bobbie’s video and I have never seen any and after watching won’t watch anymore. I recommend another video between you and Adam. Maybe do one of Adam savages myths he always wanted to do but just couldn’t
I started questioning reality when I saw that thumbnail... Like WTH is that?!? 🤣🤣
There is an entire generation of geeks, probably mostly in their late 20s to early 40s, who would be absolutely fan girling to be on that set when this was being done, myself included. I’ve seen 2 Mythbusters live shows and hopefully get to see Adam Savage again at Open Sauce this year. It is always a pleasure and I’m always amazed at how he can just come across as the the friend you’ve known forever even if you’ve only just met him. Love this video
14:35
Adam's laugh gets me EVERY time. Love this crossover event XD
0:01 *vine boom* 🤨
If you pause at 14:32 to 14:38 you will have nightmares lmfao
(12:59) there's the money shot
I prefer to see the face as MTG.
OMG, with Adam Savage, I needed this today!
Mr. Chrome!
MORE ADAM SAVAGE! Please! 🙏🏻
Ive had a bird fly into my face. Cut my cheek up with its beak.
Dan u need to do giant balloon video again but this time add this slime to the water
The collaboration I've been dreaming about for years! Two of the greatest laughs in science! Can't wait to get into this
I had long forgotten the Fabio bird strike.  Brilliant.
I may be thinking to myself, "Where's Dan"?  2 minutes later, I found him. Thought he vanished.
It's like watching my sister try to win the respect of a guy.
Adam and the boys, what a day, what a lovely day
I waited for the day you guys would collab with Adam, and I was not disappointed <3
There's an episode of Quite Interesting that features this incident, but they do not replicate it 6 times+.
My childhood dreams have come true 🥹😭
"Oh yeah it's like alien slime."
0:02 secs in and i am on the floor drunk short of breath with the ramming of god know what into what ever Adam Savage has made
12:31 kinda looks like Jimmy from the latest season of Love is Blind
living the dream 👍🏼
THE MYTHBUSTERS LEGACY LIVES ON!!!
Why are you shooting Weird Al with silicone birds 😭😭
So gross.
I think this is going to get demonetized. I-I’m struggling not to think anyone under the age of 18 should not see this video 😭
I hope he chooses to have his hair starting to fly off in the diorama. Implying fabio’s hair is a wig is hilarious.
Should've got Steve-O as a guest as well... you know exactly where he'd be helpful
Finally a mythbusters collab !  Gav, all your dreams have come true!
I’m questioning the real identity of those geese
Wgo else is waiting on the C&D from Fabio?
That was as Funny AF !!😅🤣
I have put everything on my agenda on hold to watch the entire collab series. Gav and Dan, "2 very forgiving" lads. 🍿🤼‍♂✉
The colab we never knew we needed.
The two slow mo clips from 8:29 weren't the same... what happened there?
the one overriding thought that came to my mind is a line from "A Christmas Story".........."You'll shoot your eye out kid!!"
I have hit a bird at 180mph on my motorbike smashed my visor and the rest exploded on my shoulder 😂
Sir That is no goose, and using a birthing agent on it doesn't help your case at all :)
Can we just appreciate that Fabio is a beast
Been a fan of SMG since the big red one. Best video yall have made. The collaboration took nothing away from any of the creators but only added them together perfectly. Do it again!
Awwww, you guys needed to bring the real Fabio on set!!
This was so enjoyable to watch, seeing everyone there working on that project. ♥
It reminds me of the chicken gun from mythbusters that shot a frozen chicken through a cockpit
The collab of the ages
I once ran into Adam Savage when he was hanging out at a bar while in town for a local convention. I approached respectfully for some "keep it cool" fanboying when all of a sudden William Shatner walked in (with his entourage) and we were both reduced to gibbering fanboys. Life is weird even if you weren't given access to $100k video cameras as a teenager.
That thumbnail is somewhat questionable xD
Great video  <3 !!!!
MAKE IT SUPERSONIC
4 geniuses standing in the desert doing math. 😂😂 Quality TV.
I was waiting for the collab with Adam savage
What- a- colab
Adam Savage! YEAH!!!
I've gotten hit in the face by a pigeon, it felt like a pillow in a pillow fight
Pause it at this time:  14:35
this is such a ridiculously goofy... well everything... but makes so much sense when you look at who's involved. perfect.
The collab we've all been waiting for...
That thumb nail "bird" is getting a lot of hits on Tinder 😂
Adam is just a great big kid lol,how much he still loves this stuff even after decades of doing it is heartwarming.
The image at 14:35 needs to be a meme template RIGHT NOW!!!
14:34
I wanna be as happy has Adam Savage when I grow up
14:08 it broke the wood
First time I've seen a horror film by the slow mo guys. 12:52 was especially disturbing
Well i'm glad the title told me it was a bird hitting that man in the face, because the thumbnail told me something else entirely.
The heroes of millions getting to collaborate with their hero. What a fantastic day that must have been!
What's our next project??????
That’s a very strange looking goose
Adam's laugh never gets old. More Adam collabs please!
Close your eyes, and just listen from 9:11
The thumbnail looks like Wierd Al taking a "toy" to the face 😂
I love how the bird drops his beak down and lines up for the smooch at 8:34 😂
Looks like a model of one of the dudesons
Fabio's PR team will be in touch😂.
Adam Savage!!! ❤❤❤❤🤯
An alternative title could be, This is how to eat thanksgiving dinner at 75 mph.
I’ve just realized why I like this science channel in particular, there’s no screaming, no jump cuts Perfect tone and pace
I just wish y'all had one with bones, see just how bad it would have messed up the face.
MythBusters meets The Slow Mo Guys.... YES... We need more..
“It’s hard to aim something so long”.  “I have tons of experience with that”.  That’s what she said!
Watching Adam violently smack a goose against a steel cylinder thinking "wth"? When he said, "It's just better if their unconcious." I literally spit my breakfast across the table...
I love the internet today! Youtube venn diagram complete, with the most awesome collab! 😄 Please tell me you guys will have more BTS footage for the 2nd channel? 🙏
Dan is best at being a Marksman. This video was an absolute treat to watch first thing in the morning!
Funny. Didn’t know you could use that lube product for animal birthing too 😂😂😂
How do you even make this Bobby guy laugh or even smile...
Honkin' pressure tank... Honking geese....
What gets me the most is how much the goose distorts once it makes impact XD
Gavin: "You may be thinking to yourself, 'Why is a ballistic gel goose covered in animal birthing lube being fired out of a twenty-foot air cannon?'"  Me: Omg how did he know
nature is so magical. the beauty of birth
So why is weird al getting  hit with a lubed bird
Epic crossover event. Now can we have a part 2 with destin from smarter every day’s super sonic baseball cannon? Maybe the lube would help it.
Im going to be honest, this was not fun watching while eating lol
You don't think much on the impact from watching the real time footage, but wow does the slow mo footage tell a different story. Look at that deformation on the goose and on Fabio's face! That is some _wild_ energy transfer right there 👀
Guessed it from the thumbnail! I was living in the Hampton Roads area when it happened.
Adam on the team man this is awesome
Im sorry. Animal BIRTHING lube? Why couldnt we have just used regular lube 😭
Such a stoic lad, this Bobby Fingers fella here
Frozen chicken vibes.
Goose? Looks more like a giant...
Is this even a SlowMo Guys video if Dan isn't in a tie-deyed lab coat the whole time, or getting hurt?
Those geese are so wet... this is a dream to see
yay! The co-lab we all been waiting for!!!🤩
I have an idea : water cutting machine at slow mo   https://youtube.com/shorts/sZVm8xjpFUg?si=JQ4ZbU1xfplxSKPF
The chemistry between you all is fantastic, love to see more of this :)
They should include a skeletal structure in the ballistic gel
This was incredible, guys.  Bobby Fingers is a high-class creator, and of course Adam is a legend. But beyond that, you got some top-notch footage, we'll done!
Wait-  That isn't a Goose-
this vid has a collection of my favorite Science people of all time!
Best line of the video 13:20
6:12 how i feel every time i pee
So stoked to see this colab🎉❤
Looks more like Al Yankovic than Fabio.
"you may be thinking to yourself, why is a ballistic gel goose covered in animal birthing lube being fired out of a 20ft air cannon?"
The Slow Mo Guys, Adam Savage, Bobby Fingers, and a silicone head that looks like a traumatized Weird Al. What a world.
Ok, this time you've out done yourselves. This was awesome.
Man, all this needed was one of those Confirmed plates, and it would've felt like a lost episode of Mythbusters. I also haven't laughed this hard in a long time
The test goose slaps like a tank 🤯
That Adam Savage guffaw at 5:05.... the sound of my childhood, right there
How cool, i just started watching the mythbusters again!
Bird? 🤨
flappy flappy
Talk about floppy birds.
Damn i felt that slap.. 😅😅😅
Gav with sunglasses on his nose looks both incredibly swag and like a mad scientist
14:35 is so cursed lol
Definitely did NOT think that was a duck
This rules
This is precisely what YouTube is for. Thank you for letting me see this!
This video was AMAZING! Quite literally the combination of the 2 best things from my childhood, Mythbusters and Gavin from Slowmo guys in ONE video with a myth even I couldn’t have thought of from Bobby! I hope to see more content like this!
Never meet your hero, they say. I say, jealous! Great video!
This needed Edwin and Gaspari to handle site safety
This video is like a fever dream
Gurning with the lubed goose.
Now that's some savage science
BOBBY FINGERS IN A SLOW MO GUYS VIDEO AND A NEW BOBBY FINGERS VIDEO?!
how much did bobbyfinger pay you to be on your channel?
« It’s not a supersonic goose »  Destin be like « hold my baseball »
It’s taken me this long to notice, but Dan is like the Adam Savage of The Slow Mo Guys  He knows how to do hundreds of really weird and obscure things very well
can you do a video where you drop water from a height and it explodes on its self mid air
If this was recorded back in 2022, how much of a backlog do they have?
My reaction to the eye coming put was the same as the teams.
I saw the thumbnail and thought it was weird Al
Well that thumbnail is a unique one
Yep, my brain totally processed that as a bird and not something else
Gavin wearing his regulation Sloppy Joe's shirt to meet Adam Savage is like wearing a tuxedo t-shirt to a wedding
I think if you had a larger discharge tube on the tanks port. You'll get a higher velocity....
I think my mom has one of those birds 😅
You boys made magic here
The greatest collab of all time!
epic
Being here would have been a dream come true. What a cool experience.
Ой ну и хуета
Dan has some competition it seems 👀 He really put that in there 💀
...Adam Savage is one of those people that make the world a better place to live in.
That was pretty cool. I'd love to see a peregrine falcon at 200 mph
Sorry boys. That was totally, absolutely and undeniably, underwhelming. It seemed like everyone was trying their hardest to say something cool so they could get their hero savage to laugh with them.
YESSS IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ❤️❤️❤️
Would get more velocity on the goose if you went to 2in pipe and valves for the air tank, less dynamic pressure loss, and also if you went for a full bore 2in valve to handle the pressure. Much better and faster opening if you used an air operated butterfly valve to open it, and a separate 8 bar tank just to slam that big valve open fast.
I love seeing and hearing the safety precautions being communicated. Makes me feel better that all the precautions were taken and may help other channels understand how to effectively communicate these safety precautions.
😅 My suggestion for the 2024 thumbnail so far 🤣👍
Adam! - go get checked please, full blood test and everything. it appears as if you've got ...... i won't say it so not to bring you bad luck.
4:24 Dan, it's not "if in doubt: turn it up", it's "when in doubt: C4".
kinda reminds of Jeff Bezos I actually I want to see him in front of that cannon
You know it's going to be a fun time with adam savage around
Someone needs to send Fabio a clip of this with no context.
"The mechanic coupling between the bird and the face." I'm glad adam never lost his humour
I didn’t think that was a bird
Adam Savage + Lube? You know a good time was had when...
You went for Fabio, you got TailHappy/Juiced Joyrides guy here on YouTube 🥹
The collab everyone wanted! Savage X slomoguys <3
What an amazing collab <3 Love to see Bobbyfingers getting more recognition
i didnt realise how much i missed hearing adam savage shout "in 3...2...1..." 🥺
one of the best slow mo guys yet.
That was great fun!
That guy was so excited for what the goose had in store for him!
13:12 absolutely crazy 😂😂 the quality of the slow mo is incredible
I’m disappointed Dan wasn’t the target 😂
Adam is right at home on a bomb range participating in absolute nonsense, captured in high speed. Thank you so much for this.
Why all these young guys watching old Adam tightening that pipe repeatedly. Pitch in, we need Adam to last!
so great to see bobby fingers in a collab
Wearing the Sloppy Joes shirt is the cherry on top of this. Glad to see the regulation lads at it
This is a collab for the ages❤❤
lvl 2: balistic duck in Destin's hypersonic baseball cannon
Why? Well for the glory of science of course!
The goose looks like a bad dragon reject
The "Hard to aim something do long" was very predictable 😂
Adam Savage... turd.  Great video though.  You guys always knock it out of the park...
This must be bringing back so many happy memories for Adam. 😄
Great collaboration! Lubing a bird a normal phrase for your channel and only you lot!
bwoah
I was wondering what was wrong with the first 6 minutes of the video then they put on their lab coats and all was right in the world
Truely one of my favorite human beings that adam
Having all three of them calculating slow motion speeds is so funny to me and I absolutely love it
The head is amazing !!!🤣 Great collab !
"Fill the tube with lube... Grease this bird, dip it in the lube here, pop it in."  - Adam Savage, 2024
Slo Mo Guys getting a bit one-note...Mythbusters tested thousand of totally different experiments, SlowMo guys are amusing for a bit but they really need to expand to some new ideas after all these years of watching similar prediactable videos of fast things happening slowly, i generally dont bother to watch any more and this was nothing special tbh. JUst saying. Id lke them to be great like Mythbusters were, but they are nowhere near yet
I didn't know Gavin and Adam was exactly what I was missing.
Anyone else think Weird Al Yankovic was getting slapped in the thumbnail?
A sentence that has never been said - 'Remember the time we fired a lubed up Goose made from Ballistic Gel out of a 20ft Air Cannon at Fabio?'
Fill the tube with lube!
feels like watching Mythbusters all over again.
Seeing Adam on Slow Mo Guys feels like two of your best friends meeting and hitting it off immediately.
I cannot put into words the excitement that went through me at seeing Adam Savage in a Slo Mo guys video.
this video is what second channels are made for
ADAM SAVAGE!!!
Good afternnon from the uk hope all is well
I burst out laughing within 2 seconds of the video. Nice to see Adam having fun
Ummmmmm.... The thumbnail doesn't like like a "bird" to the face.... It looks a little more R rated than that lolololololololol... Might want to change it.
5:54 that camera cut messed with my head
that poor bloke needs a vacation
8:40 I think you'll need to visit a dentist after that one, I'm actually surprised how well intact the ballistic gel goose remained
I’ve wanted to see Adam Savage and Gavin Free together for years. This is awesome.
Love your content, Gav!
more adam savage x smg please. this is incredible; adam is a treasure
always a banger when the slo mo guys upload
How the heck did Gav and Dan get a collab with Adam Savage?!?!?
I'm so happy that Adam is playing Safety Officer for this!
Always a good day when Adam Savage makes an appearance!
한국에서도 열심히 시청중입니다🥰
great video been watching for like 10 years prolly more keep it up guys
It's a me fabio!
Never thought I’d see Mythbusters and SMG in the same video. ❤
aweseome! The slow mo Busters!
Wow it's like a YouTube Supergroup! 😂👌
THE SLO-MO GUYS ARE STILL ALIVE!!!
hey guys, that thumbnail doesnt look like a bird? lol
5
"bird" in the thumbnail for sure.
thumbnail jumpscare
That ummm.. doesn't look like a bird.
I see Adam Savage I click
Anyone else watch their videos in 0.25x speed to make it even SLOWER?
That thumbnail had me thinking it was something very different
Bro WHAT is in the video image
Physics is wonderful and this is hilarious!! 😅🤣🤣😂
YEAAAAH ADAM MY MAN LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Is the dummy resemblance to Randy Johnson intentional?
Definitely knew that was a bird…
This is the tri-collab I never saw coming!
Thumbnail looks like blonde Weird AI being hit by a gelatin phalus 😂
That thumbnail is so sus 😭😭
Adam is literally a legend!
0:29 Oohhh I see. Re-creating the Fabio roller costar accident, right? I remember when this happened lol
When Adam Savage is your responsible adult you know it's going to be a fun video 😂
I need more content from SLOWLMOGUYs ..new video posted 30 secs ago
Can you try this with a prop plane engine?
I'm just watching an old Mythbusters right now, complete with then-amazing slowmo footage, wondering (as I do when I watch MB lately) when the Slowmo Guys are going to collab with Adam. And today's the day I get to be really happy.
Hello from Switzerland 🇨🇭
Im gonna say a letter................................. E
I wouldn't mind if you guys brought on Adam as a consistent 3rd Slow Mo Guy from here on out. Thx
Slow mo guys + balistic gel = ✨best content on youtube✨
Dreiundrölfzigster
Love how he was shoving it as i started the video xD
this era of slo mo guys collabing with other youtubers is amazing.
im so lucky to catch this right as you posted it!
that's quite a thumbnail
