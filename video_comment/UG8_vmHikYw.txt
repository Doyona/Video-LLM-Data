I thought Liquid was a mid team but man watching BIG is a genuinely a confusing experience 😩 had a Stake bet on them winning it and cant say they look very promising atm 😅 Liquid is at least trying by picking up pieces that make sense on paper. BIG isnt even trying...
Uuuh so who won? Stream cuts off minutes before the actual end of the final game. 😂
kyuubii has gotta be the biggest bot in the cs pro scene right now
I was a BIG fan. I was.
It‘s embarassing being a BIG fan at this time
Legacy is the deal
no one won from the Bounty hunter group😂
all the fnatic players are so different from each other
