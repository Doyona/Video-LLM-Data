Amen
How long does it take to grow Corn? It takes less than 4 months for Corn to mature.  President Bola Ahmed Tinubu promised Nigerians Corn, Agbado and Cassava.
dey play
The moment you see the government come out to talk to you Nigerians then realise they have panic and it's your time to put pressure and demand for accountability. Do not accept anything less than total accountability and those who have  milked the country dry must be held to account.
love fron kenya .nigerian,you should never give up until the goverment agrees
Pure Expression of Concerns 🙏🏽 Wisdom for each one of us to do the needful, Peace, Progress and Prosperity will Prevail in Jesus name.
tinubu should listen to the demands of peaceful hungry Nigerians and reverse all his policies immediately
Thank you my sister
This is not a protest,people are too afraid to protest
Shame to the Nigerian labour unions who should have been leading and fighting this. Shame! Shame! Shame!
Ok. This lady has a good point! Hope people will expand on these points.
💪💪💪💪💪💪❤❤❤❤❤love
Tinubu should have resigned if the country was truly democratic. His administration has caused nothing but pains and chaos in Nigeria.
Tinubu na wah for you..... When the wicked rule, the people suffer. Why you com dey let the devil use you papa???
Thank you for siesking the truth my sister you have spoken well. God bless Nigeria. I will live to see the Nigeria of my dreams.
Baba u have spoken it all . your are a darling
No more full time legislation.Away with them they should start collecting 70000
Police are our enemies
If Peter Obi is the President would you have protest?
Nigeria protest for good governance, the whole world is watching you! 👍✌️✌️❤️
Good luck protesters, stay safe and wish you all the success! 🙏✌️❤️👍
💯 for the police officer and the lady. God bless u
Yes well said dis protest is long overdue is just unfortunate is coming under present government of de dey
We must overcome in Jesus Christ name amen
Well said!
This lady is good, God bless you
Must we beg him to address the nation? He has stood his grounds of silence , let's also stand our own grounds by kicking him out of our way if up to this point, he maintains his tight- liped position .
Civic education for Tinubu and his group. This is timely since he did not go to any verifiable school. Truth will come out further especially soon.
God bless you woman
Together we stand
God will help us
Is very painful we find ourselves in this situation in  this country because of greedy leaders. Government should do the needful.
As you have right to protest so some have rights to say no. If your rights affect the right of others you do not have rights
Nigeria doe not have supreme court' But supreme corruption.!
True talk sis
Tinubu is a very wicked man , he needs to step down
Nice woman
God bless you sir
As I speak fuel subsidy  is gone.  Autocratic word of a drug addict who does not reason before vomiting trash... Quite so shameful at his age  .
What is s sad is 60yrs of independence? What has it done for these African countries? Looking back to selfless people who faught for Africa to be free are gone,they did all they could for the future generations to be free......If Africans leave the so much secrifice and the blood shared for freedom and democracy then this generation has failed!!!!!  Stand up and fight for economic freedom.Stand up to be counted.Stop complaining and stabd up,hold the leadership you vited accountable.Fix Nigeria and stop running to ither countries to suffer.✊🏾🇿🇦
We are not backing out. We have suffered enough and cannot stop.
I-M-F and the World Bank
She is very intelligent, she supposed to be a senator
If institutions protect criminals, oppressors and exploitators it will ultimately effect society negative way. Such actions can never ever bring peace and harmony within country. Government employees need to understand that every citizens need basic necessities and respectable life. It's public voice and government responsibility. Institutions are trying to protect government unlawful and non constitutional actions, it means they are also involved in violating laws and working against constitution.
Akpabio is a moron for saying you protest while we eat.  Enough is enough of the misery and hunger in Nigeria.
Question, will 🇳🇬 President listen or follow the rules when he organized protests against other presidents. He wants lakki stations PROTECTED!!  Now his supporters and underground politicians wants the 🇳🇬 citizens to  Abstain from protesting..SMH!
Dat lawyer spoke well..and tried as much as possible to stay in line with his thoughts..so he doesn't get overtaken by his emotions
They say one thing they mean another. Police pleading with thugs instead of arresting them. Army is threatening to storm the street. Where is Tinubu, Is he dead?
The only solution to this problem is disintegration....say no to one nigeria and watch everything changed to good.    As long as nigeria remains one country the worst is yet to come.  By this time next year a bag of rice will be 170k😢
Tinubu is the worst President that has sat in Aso Rock. This man has never deemed it fit to talk to the people he claims to be governing. Even Obasanjo that was an Army General was holding Presidential Media chat almost every month where he was not only addressing Nigerians but allowed Nigerians to ask him questions.  You see Buhari and Tinubu eee, Nigerians should start binding and casting them. They're curses to this  Country -one is very bad and the other is worse.
Thanks alot dear ones for representing us.
The reforms has started,a Nigerian police showing good conduct and professionalism
Thanks alot dear for speaking on our behalf.
The guy with plycard spoke very well and eloquently. Great Nigerian
Well spoken lady. Hope they listen.
The problem of African governance is wickedness.
When you see people of the nation come out on the street to express their suffering, it makes me tear! Their government has failed and should listen to the people and act to get things right immediately. 🙏✌️❤️
Nigerians are not stupid! No matter what the "elites" and "ruling class" wont understand one day hunger will lead to an implosion as it has happened in the so called "developed" nations many many years back ..be wise is all i have to say....
Nigerian must stand up to better living! The government must listen and do what the people want. God bless all protesters! 🙏🙏✌️❤️
Na wa o. In a country where the president refuses to address his people like say, when they r tired of ranting they will go home. Just send our dogs let them go keep them at bay
This is the first police in Nigeria that have science’s may god be with you sir bless your entire generation sir
The women are so powerful!
I admire the young lady that spoke up without fear. That was also very nice of the police officer that spoketoo.  Don't be surprised if Tinubu and Wike conspire to fire this policeman from the police force. Tinubu, Wike and Onanuga are the worst Nigerians of our time!
Tinubu should listen stop keeping silent help poor people that’s why u a their president stop hiding and that’s wickedness. You promised them so many things but cannot fulfill even one. Shame shame shame. God is watching
So how is your salary that you give your children 70k for their feeding?
The government should open the border let food come in from other neighbouring countries. Mr president,  pls open our borders for food to come in. There is no food in Nigeria
The fuel subsidy should come back
That Guy face beside the police officer is for me 😅😅😅
The govt should reduce the cost of governance.  The senators and other politicians should cut their salary in order to reduce the hunger. Looting of our resources is too much
Tinubu is captain of team Bill gatez in Africas neo colonial olympics. And Ruto is the coach
Really, can these Nigerian protesters remove the government or the president? Are they not beating about the bush?
The police man deserve promotion 🎉please, hear the way he approached
What a shameless and fraudulent government! The people continue to conduct themselves legally and very law abiding, while the government continue to defraud, harass, intimidate, and siphon the people.  It is quite disgraceful that the people are asking for prepaid meter to enable them  to pay for electricity consumed only. However, the government chose to charge by estimate in order to overcharge the people.
I  know, it will be Uvwie in Delta State
God bless and guide the president of Nigeria
This babe is a babe and more. Beautiful with brain
Love this movement
The people need to take the stolen mandate and give it to its rightful owner. Declare Obi President.
When I look at my beloved country Nigeria. I cry 😭.  Not crying for today but for future to come . I pray Nigeria won’t be begging for food from Cameroon or Ghana
Wow! This is highly impressive. I never imagined such a mature, sensible, reasonable, so highly well conducted protest in Nigeria. I am highly elated. Fellow Nigerians, let's keep this up. I feel for every well-meaning government official who has indeed been making efforts. But the truth remains, just as BAT stated in his meeting with governors-elect prior to their inauguration, that they knew the the enormity of the task while asking for the offices. So, no excuses. These were his exact words. Compatriots, we have scored a very high mark as far as comportment is concerned. Let's keep it up, please. By the grace of God, Nigeria will become a much better place for us all sooner than later in Jesus' name.
Same protesters voted Tinubu , where is Eniola badmus etc who campaigned for tinubu . They should all get arrested. Like I knew it will go down this way
Our politicians/leaders have no wisdom. All they care about is is worldly material things which they will NEVER take anywhere. It’s a shame that we have complete idiots ruling us. Don’t know how to build a nation!
No more Nigeria Mr Police Nigeria is dead
God help us in Jesus mighty name amen
Trust in Nigeria. This man
Pls old Nigerians no Dey suffer cos they are not protesting. Is it only we the youth that are in the country.
😢😢😢😢
INEC IS THE BEGINNING OF NIGERIA PROBLEMS. ALL THE OFFICERS BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL SHOULD BE REMOVED.THIS IS THE MOST AND NUMBER ONE PROBLEM. EVERY BODY MUST SPEAK ABOUT IT.
First time to watch thi channel. Congrats cos reporting and covering so far is plain  and we can see effort to have people see whats on ground. Much appreciation.
I leave in a free world and I never seen where there is no go zone in a public protests. Something is wrong with the government officials in power.
Omo Nigerian too love 😂😂
Nigeria is the giant of Africa
My dear Nigerians its not gonna be highjack language, its a radicalized that March the nasty politicians.
The Lady that spoke should be commended for speaking nothing but the truth. Let Nigeria government comes out to defend all those allegations. The question that Nigeria government should answer is, why is it very difficult for Nigeria government - Mr President to make the two refineries working? Are we saying that an individual in person of Dangote is richer than Nigeria? It is a shame on Nigeria government. They can’t build a functioning refinery but an individual can build it. No good roads, no water, no good hospitals, high cost of education, increase in the cost of foods, among others.
Nailed it all
What are those skit makers and our artists doing in this protest
You should not surprised if the thugs involved in the protests, the government is to blame. The protest continues to get the new Nigeria 🇳🇬 in place within the next 48 hours if the politicians doesn't do what's correct. We gonna see things to change overnight, and if the the government don't becareful  the people's power will change it to revolution.
😂😂Lawyer u said Dey wanted to confined the protester in that park so as to arrest everyone😅😅Lawyer u laughed and reasonable spokened. You even gave example if 2 million Lagosian came out can that designated place contained such large population? What a shame. The government has thought the educated fearful past youth are the same today 😅😅Nah! The scale has fallen from the eyes of the pole. Tinubu please address these demand so that pple can  go home and normalcy return
The lady is passionate about Nigeria
Im just waiting for the last day of this protest 🪧
Mmk Kjikkkjok
Nigeria is Dead and will never Hold anymore
This is Wickedness, God must certainly judge them
The floating of the currency was born out of their wicked policies and that is why they're demanding 70 percent profit from banks over their profits on foreign currencies. What a wicked government 😭
I'm blaming the senators, house of representatives, Governors, state house of assemblies etc,u were elected to represent Nigeria, but after giving u support,u are not serving us,u force us to worship u,if you don't speak for us, don't expect second term, God help Nigeria
I can't thank you guys enough. God bless you all for fighting for all Nigerians 🙏
Tinubu as a President can't come out to address the Nation...  This shows he is Empty in Ideas  Empty in leadership   Empty in IQ...  1952 is not 2024   Tinubu lacks ehat it takes to lead Nigeria to the promise land...  Nigeria isn't Lagos
This police officer is intelligent and peaceful not like what is happening at Abuja were police cannot address the protesters
Kuddos to all of you
Both of them enjoy and live good life with puplic money
Please has our president with his families and all the others politicians if they are. Not enjoying free Nigeria. Money in there home
Wicked leaders
Good talk
Are Nigeria government did not have 20 billion dollars to fixes our refinarry?
Reverse fuel prices the best option
Under our watch our Refineries ceased from working, our common wealth being mismanaged and put in the pockets of a few people. Traders are also a problem to us.  Everyday they deliberately increase prices with no reason.  Civil servants are also aiding and abetting politicians to loot.  When it's time to vote, we look for those that give us more money to vote for them and when they steal we complain. We're also our problem. Make sure we also change. Another election is coming. Don't vote money, vote credibility and good governance. Don't be a thug for politicians because you're selling your destiny by doing so.
Virtually all those that spoke on this interview spoke resoundingly well, touching on the core issues and the essence of the protests.
I Pray all this makes a whit of difference
Bosses telling employees not to go protest
America watching
They keep on borrowing and  sharing these borrowed moneys at the expense of the citizens. Nothing has been shown for the borrowed monies. What we hear regime after regime is "sacrifice, sacrifice". Tinubu go and repeat our Refineries period!
Russia 🇷🇺 🇷🇺  🇷🇺
Everyone is talking about salary. What of unemployed people. Government should provide employment to youth too.
The economy and inflation has overrun our patience.
Please u people should protest for some of us that can't go and protest do to the nature of our job with the government.
Please u people should protest for some of us that can't go and protest do to the nature of our job with the government.
Constitution my foot
Na TVC dey report this news or she forgot she works at TVC
It's so unfortunate that it's the government who is protesting against Nigerians now.
They are protesting for you too. Why the killing?
Akpabio and Wike should go they are responsible for Tinubu bad administration and failure
Akpabio and Wike should go they are responsible for Tinubu bad administration and failure
You are ignorant of what is happening in this country
The police officer is a nice man he knows that what the protesters are asking for will also benefit him and his family
That lady is a great advocate and a great leader!
As rich as Africa why is her people starving and hungry , to feed Americans and Europeans why they are right fight for you all rights , is time for Africa to be free of the white man's imperialism and colonial ways of Caucasian,Africa for Africans at home and abroad.
After sleeping for 10 days on the street  you will see that nothing will happen until you occupy all government building  prevent them from  going to work and enact useless policies
Nigeria will be ok when tinubu will be given vote of no confidence failing to step down tinubu off in the office   is still the same isue will continue occur
Which law ? The law is only for the poor not for those stealing the ressources
You are not just pretty....you get sense well well my sister
In Jesus name,none of you will die.The God of Abraham Issac and Jacob will protect you all. He will touch the heart of our leaders to do the right thing.
Stop talking shit and join the people with their struggle, which is not peace but justice and fair pay
That's the way to go. Power belongs to the people. Fight on dear brethren!!! Freedom is coming🎉
Cost of governance should be reduced drastically. Senators should not earn more than 1.5million in a month at most. Governors not more than 2million. With this, Nigeria will be better.
Tinubu is evil 😈.  God will punish him for the way he makes lives difficult for the masses
Tinubu should tire, e Don try
This man, and this woman spoke right
The North is seriously at receiving end,20 people dead already in the North,70% are idle,Now subject to hunger, the country is on gun point, Boiling situation......
We are talking of N70,000 minimum wage, well, this amount can't do anything compared to the present inflation rate as a result of removal of fuel subsidy. However, the case in the northern Nigeria is quite different. People are dieing in silence in the north. Could you believe that the problems of the country are cause by some wicked governors especially in north who treats civil servants as slaves and nobody, in the since that either the N30,000 minimum wage nor the N18,000 minimum wage has been implemented. Some governors are still paying N5,000 minimum wage and if one dear complains or write on social media of the happenings, that person will be black listed, stopped the small salary for months or years and that create fears in others so no body dear fits to complains again. 10 years with 2 or 3 promotions without financial benefits. The so called labours are government agents who are their loyalist. This protest comes timely for civil servants in the north. May God exposed them the more.  God has different ways of salvaging Nigerians from bad leaders. What is being said is the true picture of what is obtainable in the north. Please verified some people in local government in the north are  still collecting N7,000 as monthly salary. Verified, in the north even the N18,000 or N5,000 minimum wage they  government is paying. some are still receiving what they are receiving 10 or 12 year back despite 2 or 3 promotions.  It's shameful, unfortunate. painful, inhumane treatment for civil servants in the north. So help us God.
Don't mind Nigerian  government,  i am so tired of them to repair our nations  is a problems every year we are where we are, failed government, stop mentioning  God name because its not God  who is going repair our nation for us.
Tinubu is a total failure
If you know who you voted for in your ward as your Federal Representative, Senator and Governor, queue in front of his house for a basket of basic food items.
Wow! Am impressed by this lady's presentation \speech. Over the d govt
Nice speech
No responsible Nigerians voted for Tinubu.  Tinubu bought that presidency position from  INEC chairman,police and thugs.
This is stupidity of the leaders,why they will tell the protesters to stay one place, my questions is why tinubu is always using power to change constitution in this time, Nigeria people need to wake up to stop all those hijacking of constitution 😮
Evil government has completely fail .
2012 Tinubu protested against Goodlucky Jonathan,no court restricted him then,Why now that people are protesting against his unfriendly policies that even worse than 2012.
Honestly, our leaders have wickedly failed us, and there is need to make them understand where they have driven the country to
Kudos to you my dear sisters and all the patriots Nigerians protesters
This is the  work of the  external  sponsoring  the internal  to do  their   dirty  work  .
You've spoken wisely, points clearly stated and factual. Truth is, There's absolutely no regard for the rule of law in this country. Imagine thugs Infront of police and other national security agencies with boldness. Who are their sponsors and where in the law are they recognized?
Yes, i totally agree with you brother cos a hungry man is an angry man.
End BAT Governance!
Oneday be oneday nigeria 🇳🇬 government eye will clear settle this people if not
Tinubu himself knew that only 4 millions voted for him if only 20 millions come out  he's president is finished,
Break that stupid order. Is non sequitur. Law is law if is promulgated if is not promulgated is no law
This whole protest movement is such an eye opener for me.Hearing Nigerians speak/talk just bring the realization of how much smart & intelligent Nigerians  we have roaming the streets jobless/frustrated 😢.  Where as  there are so many incompetent people sitting in political positions & can not even defend how they got there wether in writing or verbally.  It’s just such a pity… SMH!   Also in addition to the protest;just as the Sir had said,not all of us can  come out but what we can be doing behind the scene is praying to THE ALMIGHTY GOD who the Bible says has the Heart of the king in His hands & He turns it to which ever direction He Pleases.GOD is faithful & kind. HE will do this one for us!  I know NIGERIAN will smile again.  GOD BLESS NIGERIA & NIGERIANS!!!
God bless you the way you handle the matter
Thank you mama,we love you. Your children must also be proud of you
Tinubu God will help u. Find solutions for them. N stop bandit disstoping the people farmers
God bless everyone out there may the lord hear our cry
Sorry to say "The so called leaders or politicians are demonic agents of the globalists.  Their hearts has been sold to the devil! Otherwise, how would man who have conscience have the temerity to tell Nigerians, Go for Hunger protest and we will be eating in our homes!"
You think that you can just take Nigerians with your so called peace talking
Yes  protest must not go with violence, really this not protest having Intention to destroy people property ,the people concerns have heard u people yesterday, and still the protest continue why? They are ready to fight with security force  they are not hungry  we are watching them carefully those who organise the protest have double mind, going to lekki to do what ? ,in fact the security force should wake up and protect people properties
God bless you ma
Thank you all my brothers and sisters for the wonderful work you guys are doing
Tinubu is the grandfather 👴 of thuggery he feels Nigeria 🇳🇬 is Lagos where he’s able to get away with it little did he knows his cup is already broken that’s all his efforts are thorns on an average Nigerian he should change his tactics otherwise he’s fueling a revolution that’ll amaze the world 🌎 he has pushed Nigerians to the brink of collapse
The Nigerian security agency see nothing wrong with the collapsing state of Nigeria economy because it is benefiting at the moment to the detriment of the future generation.
Economic Crisis 😢 we want our nigeria back 😢 Long live the youths
Well spoken ma God bless you big aunty i pray for a better nigeria 🇳🇬 May God hear our cry 😢
Ur president is chicken hiding,keep it up guy’s they need to fill the heat not business as usual.
The governor of the Lagos state and the TINUBU are thugs and criminals. I support you all from the USA 🇺🇸. Thank God for social media. Keep exposing your wicked government.
The salaries and allowances of all members of senate and house of representatives are to slice and make Nigerian politic non lucrative.
This is nonsense for real....This same Judiciary brought this useless government to Nigeria and are still destroying Nigeria.....if only these judges can be visited
Storm Aso Rock , everything else is just talk .
Beautiful sister with beautiful speech God bless you ma
My beloved sister, you spoke so well, God bless you
APC tugs are trying to twart people's efforts they and their children's children will suffer for this for years
End bad government 😭
All the SEAPORT IN OUR BELOVED COUNTRY NIGERIA MUST BE FIXED AND START WORKING IMMEDIATELY PORT HARCOURT SEAPORT AND CALABAR SEAPORT
For the fact that govt are sending touts to disrupt peaceful protest against this kakisyocratic and kleptocratic govt shows how wicked this govt is BBB
Those who campaigned and voted for Tinubu should be the ones doing this protest!
The people are afraid to protest
All them million of people and only a small amount of people turn out to protest
Which Supreme Court you're talking about? Is it the same Supreme Court that put us into the mess we find ourselves. They would definitely be punished.
Nigeria i🇳🇬 is not for tinubu and PD APC
70 thousand Naira in Nigeria is equal to $7.00 salary paid to Nigerians. Meanwhile, their president bought a 160 billion private jet!
Wasting of time protest 😅😅😅
Wicked leaders
Apc thieves
Tinibu and his cabinets are week what a pitty 😢😢😢
Keep it up my brothers n sisters great nation
This lady have said it all if the government will bring back the FUEL SUBSIDY back all this will not happen
Nice one
Intelligent ppl
We have so many ladies like this lady agitating that have been elected to the national Assembly, the question is what have they done. They too collected the so called expensive vehicles. Everyone is angry when they are followers, as soon as they become leaders, its a different case. Who is fooling who.
Akpabio and Mahmood must resign
Love from Ghana . if Nigeria stands Africa stands. don't give up Nigeria.
Nigeria Police has lost their dignity and this reflects their level of hypocrisy. Their acts make them hated by the citizens and have no pity for them.
They have refineries in Malta reason they don't want our refineries to work...Even the presidency is heavily involved in the Malta scandal...thankfully, dangote decided to expose them   Mr. President is a criminal we all know the subsidy payment is being paid to himself and his cronies
God bless Nigerian youth protesters: your demands are simple and clear. The govt. Understands these demands they are just deliberately  giving a deaf ear.
The government brings criminals to disrupt the real protestors and blames it on Nigerians, shame Tinubu. Tinubu and his cohorts are living off Nigerian's dime, the least you can do, is to provide basic needs for Nigerians to thrive.
Unfortunately the police stupidly don't know that the protest is for their good also.
Akpabio and wike is our problem in the country
Youth pls never give up
This is why i refused to vote for Tinubu drug baron. INEC And Judiciary have destroyed Nigeria
70000 is 35 pounds. Shio
APC must go. Tinubu must step down .. hoping for a better nigeria.. The inec chairman caused all the chaos in nigeria
May the good God of heaven hear our honest cry😭
One who cannot feed, How can he think of tuition and accomodations under this government.
We need people like this lady in d parliament
FREE PREPAID METER TO ALL CITIZEN
Evil people i taught PETER OBI won but its Igbo man Tinubu is better why crying 😢
They are TINUBU TORGS TINUBU IS NOT QUALIFIED TO BE A PRESIDENT I SAID IT BEFORE .
Complete reverser of the anti people  policies. God bless you all.
# End bad governance in Nigeria.
Nigeria politician are evil and wicked
The thug are fool hope they are getting money from tinubu
God please touch the heart of our leaders. The hunger is too much.
If the protesters want permanent change they should demand for the legislature to be compensated using the civil service scale. At the moment, the legislators and the citizens live in a parallel reality. That should be the baseline for any negotiation.   They should also insist on immediate reversal of exchange rates floatation and re-introduction of the oil subsidies with transparent monitoring of its implementation.
Please where is this protest..l am proud of all the speakers...
Meanwhile Asari is threatening protesters not to protest on Rivers state
Please ensure a peaceful protest
Oppressors = AG Lagos
Smart youth not lazy youth  I hope you're watching
This is a mature and honest comment. Go, girl. I pray the government listen and respond to the plea of the citizens😅😅😅😅
This  police  officer is very good.  He knows  his work  perfectly.
This  lady spoke to truth.  God bless you.  ❤ U sist.
Lol that's Nigeria 45k for fuel 210k for the kids upkeep and our minimum wage is 70k who is now fooling who. This man is not ready for the progress of the country.
Facts❤
I love you ma
Use of IREV for election.
Thank God once again for another very honest and extremely sensible son of the Southwest, a very responsible and God-fearing Yoruba son, who refused to buy into the lies of Idiotic others, who have been lying to themselves that Igbos are the planners of the hunger and anger in Nigeria, thus thinking they can tribalize National Issues.
AKPABIO MUST GO . AKPABIO IS A BIG DISGRACE  THAT  CLUELESS SPEECH FROM HIM  A SENATE PRESIDENT IS ENOUGH TO IMPEACH HIM IF NIGERIA  IS  A COUNTRY.  BOTH NWIKE  THEY MUST  BOTH MUST  BE REMOVED  FROM THE OFFICE . FBI DIRECTOR  WAS REMOVED FROM THE  BECAUSE  SOMEONE  TRY TO ASSASSINATE DONALD TRUMP,  WHICH AMERICANS  SAYS THAT THE FBI DIRECTOR WAS CARELESS IN HER JOB TO PROTECT  THEM AND WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THIS FBI DIRECTOR WAS NOT ON THE VENUE WHERE THEY WANTED TO ASSASSINATE DONALD TRUMP.  NWIKE  AND AKPABIO  HAVE BEEN  OPEN WITH THEIRS ACTIONS AGAINST NIGERIANS CITIZENS  . THEY MUST GO .
Poverty wage well  said"
That first speaker is correct
I told someone days back before this protest  Some people will take bribe and nothing will happen  Nigeria leaders has nothing to do for it citizens rather than packing the money into their pockets, i pray this time will not come to past whereby everyone will be shooting from angle to angle  I am scared because it might happen soonest the way things are going
What an amazing speech kudos my dear sister, you really say it all.
Hmmm😢
The president should bring back fuel subsidy
To be in a cage to be killed. Thats why  the court gave such  ruling. Our judiciary is corrupt  as the Executive  and the legislature.  So bad
Those that said they will behead citizens of Nigeria. Listen, God will not allow you and those that sent you wake up. Hand stronger than you will hold you one day.
Fuel subsidy van nor be reversed.
Nice
Don't trust that nonsense police man
The way Nigeria is being ran is impossible for future growth . Like asking for free water is funny, but has the government enabled the country to run without free water ? No. The government policies are not sustainable nor working. It’s the source of the policies , a policy made with re election and servicing of your political supporter is not going to work .
Yes o minimum wage is a poverty income in Nigeria !!!
Live stream
Why can't Tinubu address the Nation & de-scalate things for now, and implement their requests (e.g.fuel to N200-N300 per liter or so) before permanent solutions are put in place...? Fuel price can be reduced by supplying crude oil  from the standard OPEC recognised & allotted bpd -  barrels per day crude oil  for domestic consumption - to Dangote & other local  refineries, to refine in exchange for petrol & other products. Afterall this crude oil swap arrangement, is what obtains with most foreign refineries, from where fuel are imported.   Where are their governors, the assembly members to deliberate on all this among themselves & to curtail futher damages. Do the rulership really have the interest of the people at heart..? There's certainly a great disconnect between the rulership and the ruled! And this is quite frightening!   Should the protest need to  ever be discussed about at all, if the government had taken proactive measures; having been given over one month of notice of protest?  Is there any more  patience needed, to reduce the salaries of Nigerian legislators, reduce fuel prices immediately...?  These are basic actions that will assuage the protesters.
MY HEART HURTS FOR NIGERIA’S LESS FORTUNATE PEOPLE!💔
Reno omokiro will be somewhere accusing and accusing
Since this protest start tinubu never still come out to address this issue  no peace for the government
Good talk madam
❤❤❤❤
I Respect you sister God bless Nigerians

proud of this policeman better person pickin na im be this
I love this. Nigerians are more more mature people. Peaceful protest God will fight this battle for us in Jesus name.  You spoke well .
Non of the protesters is even buying from the mineral hawkers because of the prices. This is  INFLATION IN OUR COUNTRY..... Haba!! It is well.
FOR ONCE A PRESS PERSON VOICES THE TRUTH! AWESOME!!! GOD ALMIGHTY BLESS YOU MY DEAR, ALWAYS.❤ YOU ARE A TRUE PATRIOT. MOST PRESS PEOPLE ACT AND TALK AS THOUGH THEY ARE NOT NIGERIANS.
from kenya, its your right as nigerian citizen to have good roads, constant electricity, good schools, , you should not beggin for it, meanwhile tinubu and his gang of thiefs are leading overwhelming good llife using your money its not theirs
May God bless everyone over there IJMN Amen
Mr President pls address our concerns
It won't be well for all this our politicians that have subjected us to all this evil
Electoral reform…
Let there be peace, let there be peace in Nigeria, this is our country.
The solution in the past is for Nigerians to japa. This is why we are looked down upon all over the world. To demand accountability of our leaders is something we have really never done before. Instead we continually fall into the tricks of our leaders who play tribal politics. But Nigerians have to be wary lest one group of corrupt people use this protest to replace another group of corrupt people as our leaders.
Indeed! The 60 years and above have failed the youths of Nigeria. What will it cost you to make a difference?
Tinubu  must  go
Thanks sir
Let the truth be told. The situation is very painful. Why should peaceful protesters be exposed to more pain, brutality and deaths. I can understand if it gets violent. Point of order can be used to control the situation. Nigerians😊 are very peaceful but majority are hungry. Our leaders are unwilling to make any personal financial sacrifices. Trust is totally lost. We are therefore saying No, to bad governance! Let the poor breath and be allowed to also live too. May God have mercy on Nigerians and Nigeria in Jesus mighty name. Amen.

They don't want the whole world to see their secrets!
God blessed you Ma,
Let us divide Nigeria, it is not  working and will never. The corruption is getting worse rather than getting better, the  Amalgamation that  joined us together has expired that why the country is not working. The  constitution is fraudulent and our leaders are weaked , their  children are wearing trillions wrist watch etc and the common man can not afford one meal a day. No  hospital, water ,light, most of it, no  security, we all left to be killed by Fulanis terrorists. We are all living in hell. Security is mostly important,
Government care for their expenses, that's they don't feel the pains!
Tinubu is a failure
Corruption is Nigeria's Brother evil  leaders
People of Abia State cried bitterly , prayed and protested and God heard their Cry and sent Alex Chioma Otti to dry their tears. Today almost everyone in Abia is SMILING 😂😂😂. We pray for a RADICAL Change in Our Great Country, NIGERIA. God will intervene.
But did this government give Nigeria a fair election? Did they obey the rues?
If you catch any thief now they will definitely mention police so as to know the extent of criminology in police
For instance if the senators earn 259 thousand Naira a month , what stop the  civilian from having half of that as their monthly wages? Sevety thousand cannot buy a bag of rice; what about rent, medicine and Hospital expenses, travel, bills etc! It is ridiculous. How long will you be on red zone for? A leader that cannot take correction nor compassionate is not fit to be a leader.
