Means Breakthrough is lost.
Russua can not stop the destruction of Russian refineries.
ELIMINATE ZELANSKY  HE IS TRYING V. HARD TO DRAG USA INTO WAR WITH RUSSIA 🇷🇺💪. WHY CAN'T TRUMP AND HIS GOVRERNANCE JUST RESIGN?!
🥱 wake me when both sides are dead
NATO equipment is failing 😂
Once this layer of defenses falls, Ukraine will be nearly done for. Ukraine is quickly running out of soldiers.
Those Russian tanks are no longer in storage because they are either deployed,  training or being upgraded, or in line to be upgraded. Russia had 20,000 working tanks before 2022. Not all that many were destroyed in the present conflict. Stop listening to propaganda from the losing west, and Ukraine.  😂😂❤❤
Ukranian intelligence kills anyone anywhere who tells the truth about the dire situation for the Ukrainian military 😂
We live in very interesting times, not nice times but interesting times. We get to see a conflict up close and how the system works. 😊
Russia's MoD has clearly stated they will destroy all power distribution and supply in areas supporting the AFU with the goal to completely destroy power in Ukraine. It will be a cold winter dur to the terrorist attacks on Russian Oil and Gas businesses. Having no power will severely restrict transport within Ukraine and may help the people of Ukraine to decide not to support the expired leadership of the country. Even small generators will be targeted after main power sources are destroyed.
Slava Russia!
What precisely is an "energy facility"?
Only thing more dangerous than being an enemy of the US, is being an ally!
The world is waiting for multiple oresnicks over top of Israel... And that's a fact palantir
The Bolsheviks are so ingenious they have the world thinking that Nazis are leading this fight against Russia. Israel considers that area to be theirs
Rassia won't accept the role "Stable boy" of the West. Respect to them.

Europe Gaza is Ukraine.. America and EU leaders are making money..
How mad Ukrainian people,throw Zalensky
Ukraine has been hijacked by Zelensky regime
😂😂😂 anyone who trusts Washington on a political level deserves everything that happens to them. Turkey, Taiwan are the best two to be backstabbed
Winter is approaching fast ...depopulation of Kiev and Kharkov has started, the clown will be out of office soon.
17:40 'Putin promised to show us the new weapon'. What is this new weapon?
Avantguard loading....
River line
Russia didn1t wanted to totally destroy Ukraine's power network, but getting hit in their refineries daily went too far, in 1 day they sent Ukraine to stone age, for the civilians. Imagine this for a month.
wow, those Russian washing machines are quite something.
Russians have full support from Indians.
As long as there is one soldier left, Zelinski will never give up
Many thanks to Military Summary for this latest report daily covering deploy the front line of war activity. Excelent report,Rusian iniciative refressing  tropas and new powerful arm coming
Good.
Russia should tell in a clear way to everyone in Germany that never again it will permit a stunt like in the 40’s, 27 million Soviet citizens were sacrificed to clean the territory of all those hitlerites. Btw same applies to Finland, Hungary and Roménia
Russia has to take off its gloves and get serious, because the west is serious about dismembering the Russia Federation and go for a resource grab like the hitlerites tried to do in 1941. Germans are at it again.
So what is the new deviating weapon.
To prevent the possible arrival of subsonic Tomahawk missiles, I believe that the Russian Federation's air and space forces can deliver heavy and precise strikes to the logistical routes through which these cruise missiles could reach Ukrainian territory: bridges, airports, ports, railways, roads, etc.
I love the skynews analysis...russia will run out of washing machines by xmas 2023 lol
Finally the end of CIA/Ukraine Propaganda and lies.  Now past the last defense lines Russia will run like wild dogs! The Flower will bloom in all directions and will take everything east of the River.  Ukraine lost over 270,000 men in the last 6 months as they retreated everyday for over 30 months. And they show over 400,000 soldiers deserted. Russia took more ground in May than all of last year and in June took even more. Meat assaults or human waves are all nonsense, Russia fights in the 3 man or 6 man configuration and then shells the Ukrainians until they withdraw or remain there forever. There are Ukraine videos of many train loads of new Russian Amour going to Zaporizhia and Pokrovst daily. Russia tripled BMP 3 production last year,  produced 1500 tanks, is building 10 times as much self propelled artillery,  built 5 million drones and just delivered 40 new jets. Ukraine has lost all the Abrams tanks sent to them. Ukraine may not even last this year but surely will be done by next year. Russia has many tank factories not even operating and can ramp up more if needed. Ukraine has the total lack of care for the men, kidnap men off the streets, put them on the front line without training, not allowed to retreat and most die in a week. Russia has lost about 120,000 men total and Ukraine lost almost 1.8 million as over 80% are killed by artillery and Russia shells at 10 to 14 to one and makes more shells in 3 months than the entire NATO and the USA can make in a year, according to the head of NATO Mark Rutte.  Please send the AZOZ to the front to get their well earned reward!
Wrap em off and send em to Bandera asap. Tnx guys!!!
I have a frend who is a buisnisman and order wooden palets from western Ukraine. And they told him that war did not touch regular companies in the west UA. But the prices of material are going up.
Z from Romania
Russia could have done this from the vergy beginning. This just goes to show, that their goals were in fact what they said they were. To "demiliterize". Once they see their goal as achieved, they are finishing the conflict off.   Just listen to what the Russians are telling you. Lmao.

Even without good preparation and reckless of Russian invasion in Ukraine,Russia still did well and understood the true power of America and NATOs Goblin Leaderships and their Equipments. 🗿
"Support for Ukraine against Russia is a very cheap way to make sure Moscow does not pose a threat to NATO" - the Netherlands' defense minister Kajsa Ollongren 3.10.2023 in Warsaw. * Q. Russians have criticised you for saying that the battle will be won on the battlefield. Do you still believe that this will be the case?   "Normally wars have been won or lost on the battlefields. Yes."    - the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission - Josep Borrell, 11.04.2022  at a press conference in Luxembourg * "Today's Ukraine is a testing ground for NATO equipment. All Ukrainians should understand the importance of this mission." - former NATO Chief Jens Stoltenberg  * "Britain would never recognise them (cities Rostov and Voronezh) as Russian."  "We are supplying and offering extra support into our Baltic allies across the Black Sea". - Liz Truss * NATO must “stand with Ukraine (...) no matter what my German voters think”.  "If Putin does not turn his policy around 360 degrees, then there is no way to ensure long-term peace in Ukraine." -  Annalena Baerbock * "Penis is not necessarily a male sex organ."  - Tessa Ganzerer-Member of the German Bundestag for the Green Party. * "Yes, Europe is a garden. We have built a garden. Everything works.

And here, Bruges is maybe a good representation of beautiful things, intellectual life, wellbeing. (...) Most of the rest of the world is a jungle, and the jungle could invade the garden. The gardeners should take care of it, but they will not protect the garden by building walls. A nice small garden surrounded by high walls in order to prevent the jungle from coming in is not going to be a solution. Because the jungle has a strong growth capacity, and the wall will never be high enough in order to protect the garden.  The gardeners have to go to the jungle.

Reason to be Excited.
I feel sorry for people in this world weather and I feel sorry for children and families and sick and elderly people . I really don’t like this suffering and hope and pray they all get out of this
This kind of makes me think Ukraine isn't getting american Intel anymore
No electricity no drones
THE REAL WORLD stands with Russia, the fake and make believe world is using Ukraine as a cannon fodders.
Sitting in Dnipro with no power for half of the day, listening to Russian drones flying overhead and explosions all around us, watching the front lines move west, I have to say to general Cornflakes, it feels great to be winning.....
Weeb Union channel ✌️
Where russian will stop
Anyone can tell about russian target on territory
According to Russian bots the 3 day special military operation is going splendidly well🤣🤣🤣
We are all so tired of Ukraine and Ukrainians....
Merci
Tick tock America youre time is...almost up
Russia needs to do one thing take the Capital out
If USA SEND MORE MILITARY EQUIPMENT  TO UKRAINE RUSSIA MUST USE POSEIDONS AGEINST. USA. ALSO RUSSIA  MUST WITH CHINA DEPLOY   MILITARY AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO VENEZUELA AND OTHERS LATIN COUNTRIES  .THOSE MUST BE IN BRICS WITH ECONOMICAL SUPPORT.
Zelensky is being paid handsomely for what he is doing to Ukraine. OK sure, I can understand that. But, what I do not understand is, why do Ukrainians think any better of Zelenskiy, and why do they continue to be suckers for bad treatment defending US UK EU global interests?
Thank you for the update ❤
According to Weeb (WU) turtle tanks have also made their reappearance.
Ukraine troops desperately need supplies of new army boots as the heels of their shoes have worn out from all the back peddling.
Z 🇷🇺🇦🇺 from Sydney Australia
DUDE it's been 4 weeks now that I havn't watched your updates/videos and I'ts like NOTHING has changed at all on the ground... Still the same "villages/small cities" being surrounded and NO progress at all...Except some fields or little tree lines...  At this speed the war will last for 20 more years!!!
Zelenskyy doesn’t care
The situation Trump put huge tariffs on the Chinese and crashed the American market like always on the weekend .... Lol pretty soon war will either stop or it's going to crash the world market because Ukraine war will crash one of the countries and the rest of the world will feel the pain too because they are all connected and if BRICS is not going to start their banking system by 2026 even though I already know they are going to then. BRICS side will feel the pain too lol  so Ukraine war will crash world market and people will be more in DEBT good job 😂😂😂
Putin is the best Chess player he made Zelensky get bold to be able to corner him without escape 😂
To be America's enemy is dangerous, to be America's friend is fatal.
The Russians are hopeless. Putin doesn’t know what he’s doing.
А как на английском флаговтык будет?
Aussie Cossack No1.
Why are Russians listening  to this  BS?  Russian forces  were crushed,  defeated,  and destroyed  in Dobropilia and Pokrovsk directions,  yet  Dima  is  still  reporting  disinformation that Putin's forces  are  winning  in Pokrovsk.
I told them time and again never send tanks up front or use them to push through,they will only get peppered by drones and destroyed.Keep tanks in the rear of troop formations,and shell the enemy positions,if infantry is under pressure,reinforce their defence by going on assault with tanks,only then
Ukraine need peace with  Russia nothing other solution. No air defense against Russia missile unless Ukraine are going to destroy for good .When u have  a half ethnic Russia population in Ukraine u aren't going to win the war.
The difference between the Ukraine and the Titanic is that the lights were on when the Titanic went down !  Viva Russia 🇷🇺  Support from Canada 🇨🇦
The only thing that is left now is a left hook by Russia for the knockout, it is called TKO
I want some oreshnik !
there are stories about a new EMP bomb to blackout electricity of vast areas in one second
SLAVA RUSSIA 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
"We will cause a blackout in Moscow" -Volowhatever Zelenskiy
If I had to hazard a guess ... I'd say the ground is freezing and they can drive over it without sinking into the mud.
I think Trump told Putin in Alaska to get it over with destroy what needs to be destroyed and  end the war
The whole West playing whit "no Ace cards" has now been revealed. Russians real force on war capablity is still under coverege! Why are European leaders so ignorant! Thurst for US help ( they might have something to response), but are they willing to jeapardise USA,s future? for this stubid continece and take steps to WW3?  Nobody wins!  These glowns,  European leaders? How is it bossible, that majority of these 450 million people still beliewe all  lies whe hawe been told?  This EU is going to broke appart on coupe of years, ennivatebly! Thank god!
Bye Bye ms. Ukrainian pie ……
If From Lisbon To The  East Of Russia We Would Have  Spoken One Romanic Language, We Would've Been ONE, Measure Something Like This! I Was Recently Surprised By A Ukrainian Father, Immigrant In România, Which Spoke Românian, He Spoke Even Hungarian, Although I Do Not Favour Hungary, As For The Hungarian  Language, It's Limited To 10 Max 12 Million People That Belong To No Great Family Languages: ROMANIC, GERMANIC, SLAVIC; IF SLAVS WOULD TURNED ROMANIC, WARS WOULD'VE BEEN AVOIDED!
Russia 🇷🇺 keeps departing the western alliance military 🪖 and economically whilst BRICS is growing bigger than G7 economically year after year 😅 😂 Russia 🇷🇺 doesn't need more lands from Ukraine but the west will not be allowed to occupy Ukraine land or government. No more Nazis regime. 😅😂
They never used that Oreshnik thing. They only tested it once in UA with only dummies and no weapons. The footage they showed us looked to me more like project blue beam, (highly advanced holographic projection), rather than real. If so, it would explain why they've never used it for real and may never do...
I don’t stand with Ukraine 🇺🇦   I stand with Russia 🇷🇺
Zelensky must realise now just how many assumptions he was making about Ukraine keeping this up.
It's a complete nonsense to claim  Ukrainians  are losing.  Russia  has  lost  the war.  Attacking  civilian infrastructure would not win the war.  Russia has lost more than 1,000,000 troops dead and wounded, thousands of equipment,  oil refineries,  nuclear bombers,  kicked out of Kherson,  Black Sea, Kyvi,  Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, and other places.  Putin's forces are unable to take control of illegally annexed Ukrainian territories. Ukrainians  are destroying  Putin's oil refineries and logistics.
Mr. Putin should get the Nobel Peace prize.  For successful denazification efforts, of course.
I ll unsubscribe if you Dont remove killzone in 24 hours haha
1:03 Dima, whatever Ukraine air defences were active, Russia took them out by upgrading their Iskander missiles with AI: so that it zig zags at the terminal phase and hits those patriot systems.
3 plus years Russia still doesn't have shit to show for it except a pile of dead orcs
If Russians are using vehicles does that Ukr drones are not operating in that area
خسروی در حال کپی برداری😂
Probably wise to wrap the 💩 show up asap, to not give any idiots (of which there are many who only profit but suffer no threat) the idea that Using Thanks is a “good idea” - newsflash, not fake news, that would be extremely foolish. Resulting in reciprocal action to OEM Sources wherever they are, Latitude & Longitude.  Leave the schmuck vassals alone, they are only tagging along bc they’re getting paid to.
❤ Russia 🐻 ❤
Take Odesa.
This is what happens with a real clown running Ukraine controled by the US

Vive la Russie❤❤❤
The blue flash is a transformer blowing.
Western organized genocide on Slavs
Thanks
Wait,  I thought Ukraine was winning!!!  Okay, will take Crimea soon.  News from USA can' be wrong!!!
EXCELLENT REPORTING . . . THANK YOU
World as we know it from before it will stop to exist. West will collapse
Putin is been playing nice f to long
Definitely an acceleration, definitely not a "final blow". It's too early, it's certain when you know Odessa is on the menu: don't rush on the spaghetti, they're only the starter.
Z from Jamaica 🇯🇲
Zelenski doesn't really care about the native Ukrainian people. His deals are with Von der Lyon a Jarad Kushner to take it for 'their' people.
Don't forget the facts. Russia started the War, as you never call it. 😂 I hope you don't get jailed by doing a  report.
FACT CHECK.  In three years (since Oct 22) RU has captured less than one percent of UA.  Obviously, the three day ‘special military operation’ is a great success!  Putin remains a master strategist!!!🤣🤣🤣
operation "find out" has begun.
about time, too. Putin's peers and advisors are right; he has been far too compromising, and the west has no intention of seeking peace or a negotiated settlement. the alternative is perpetual war and strife, and that seems like an idiot's notion to me.
👍👍👍👍👍👌👌👌👌👌👌
Is there anyway to have a distance scale on your maps? I would like to know what the scale is on these maps. Thanks for all you do !
Ukraine are a sitting duck
Thanks Dima.
Thank you for daily updates ! MS is one of the best news sources ( conflict in Ukraine ) in the world, if not the best ! I think the best ! Greetings from the US and the Netherlands.
Only NATO soldier deployment can rescue Zelenskyy from certain defeat.
A Crisp, Concise and Informative Missile Attack Report and a Crisp, Concise and Informative Front Line Report. I put my like.
This guy is so full of shit it’s comical.
Z-Rat will be visiting Moscow in shackles very soon!
War is inhumane but Russia destroying power and infrastructure before winter creates better opportunity for civilian evacuation with less hardship. If Kiev agrees to Russian peace terms soon, that also creates time to restore  power and infrastructure before winter starts. Going forward, Russia will likely continue such attacks until peace is obtained.
Thanks Dima from UK.
Russia now have created anti drone weapons. This was revealed last week.
In Russia long gasoline lines, importing of gasoline (!!!), stock market crashing, major companies imposing a four-day working week, record level of bankruptcies and debt defaults, millions of people in real hardship, record level of cash withdrawals from banks, six trillion rouble budget deficit from Jan to August 2025, more than one million war casualties, etc. etc.,  but DON’T WORRY, Putin remains a master strategist!!!   He will protect you!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Russia is unstoppable.. amazing
The great Russia the wining Russia Uraaaaaaa
Zelensky it is time to surrender before more people dying.
Did they use special expl*sives against the powerplants like with CARBON to cause more electrical shortcuts  ?
Thanks di.a
Glory to UNSTOPPABLE, Heroic Russian Army! V. & Z.!
How can you believe the statements of the Ukrainian media? They say so many lies and cheap propaganda.... It is best seen in the statements made public about the shooting down of 90% of drones and missiles but... Ukraine is in the dark because of the drone attacks... which HIT THEIR TARGETS... so they were not shot down by anti-aircraft guns
Putin keeps the door open for Trump, but the warmongers are in Trump's ear and he is an unreliable party in any negotiation.
Z from France.
OK,  min  venn
My great respect goes to Russian People, who fights against the neoliberal world of US and their neonahhyst friends from UK and EU! Thank you, russians!
Zelenskyy should either resign or commit Hari Kari.
I'd be happy with another O
No more energy? Russia lost its patience with Ukraine. It took a while. Imo
Behind every Russian Missile or Drone is one hell of a dishwasher chip!
Those dodgy Tomahawks, Taurus and Barracudas  will not shift the dial in the slightest. Missiles never do, only ground troops actually doing the fighting matters! The Ukrainian losses in manpower are much higher than can possibly be replenished The outcome of this attrition is self-evident: Parade of the Vanquished Odessa 2026
MAGA=Make America Gay Again!
Madeleine Albright: If we have to use force, it is because we are America. We are the indispensable nation. We stand tall. We see further into the future. Interviewer: "Was the death of 500,000 Iraqi children worthy?" Madeleine Albright: "Yes! We think it was worthy."
Instead of buying overrated American arms, Europe is advised to buy from Russia as being significantly better and more effective!
Oreshnik: Hello, is it me you're looking for?
American arrogance and self-delusion are trumping all reason!
Marshal Georgy Zhukov the one who beat Hitler:   "We have liberated Europe from fascism, but they will never forgive us for it"
This should have happened in the first week of this conflict now it's seen as an "escalation" and the Russian people should be horrified Putin still see's trump as a peace maker, putin needs to be replaced before Russia is handed to America
Putin: from underdog to top dog Zelenski: from hero to zero
YouTube censorship peaks with each Russian advance
The collective West created quite a few monstrosities: the EU, NATO, USAID and Zelenski
This channel only tell lies! Jewlensk is barking for a lot of money, weapons, Nato soldiers, US. garantees, just because. 😂😂😂 excellent video, Dima!
like shooting fish in a barrel
Ukraine is not part of NATO or the EU. It currently compensates for a great deal of monetary resources and capital and draws NATO's attention to deficits. At the end of this war, there will be a huge wasteland between Russia and NATO. A stable army in Europe and what remains of the Kremlin's economy. Perhaps a few Tomahawks will reach the Kremlin itself. It would be a change if the war also reached the decision-makers.
Zelenski from his bunker in Kiev: Where is Steiner?
There is no glory to be had in dying for Western Interest conjured up by policymakers of Aspen and The Rand Corporation.
Russia is indispensable! The world needs Russia for sanity, balance of power and keeping the depraved & belligerent West in check.
Russia is not our enemy. From the UK with love! ❤
GLORY to holy Russia!
What happened to the NATO "Game changing" weapons??? 😂😂😂 🇷🇺🫡🇷🇺
ZOV!!!!!!!  VORWÄRTS RUSSLAND    URAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I thought the power outage is just a temporary thing and in most places it's already back up.
Im sure Zelensky is safe in another EU country
The Russian concentration of armored units and large numbers of soldiers implies that Ukraine no longer has drone abilities in that battle zone.  The Ukrainian defenders have no experience in defending against tanks.  Not looking good for the Ukrainians that are left there.
Thanks Dima. 👍
My favorite style of update, thank you DiMA.
railway bridges Dima lol take most of them out will cripple the whole country 100 % not only military logistics but also civilians
ALL SYSTEMS GO, TERMINATORS ON THE FRONT, FIBER DRONES ARE FLYING, AVIATION IS WORKING! FINAL PUSH RUSSIA LETS GOOOOOO!!!!!
Just three month now remaining until 10th of January with probably severe winter conditions for the Ukraine people ahead. That's all a still carefull planed and executed war of attrition, I guess most agree to that - I miss predections on the still coming destruction of so much more viable Ukraine energy infrastruktur and other until then.   And this looks as if almost deciding on the outcome of this war - not mentioned as well (wests media is just all propaganda, just claims and Talk, newspaperpaper) is that Russias slow progress on the ground served another purpose too - taking over destroyed villages without people only (except the ones that voluntary went to the russian side), means that the number of refugees and displaced persons inside Ukraine becomes higher every day on an ever shrinking area - not good.  (And we know that Russia too thinks of the rejected peace 2.5 years ago 'because of BoJo to Kiev'.)
Russia 💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
8:02 Ukraine's new weapon looks like an RV draped with thin armor. ❤❤❤
"War in Ukraine will continue through 2026, Dmitry Zolotarev Geo Political Affairs and Military Analyst speaking to Redacted in early January 2025.
If Russia is forced to take some additional important part of Ukraine, they are not going to give it back.
Dima speak very often of strikes by Iskander missiles but i have a lot of doubts of the use of these missiles who can hit at 500 km to hit target at less of 100 km . It seems more logical to use tornado S or another weapons maybe an air ground missiles 😮
Again, nothing at odessa.  Should bomb idessa, then drop leaflets telling civilians to leave b4 the next round. Sooner than later the civilians will leave and flee to Romania. Then the eu has a new problem, tens of thousands of civilians fleeing for their borders.   This is something the eu doesn't want.  This for es the eu to react rather than act.
You dont try to end a conflict supplying weapons. Stop saying Trump wants to end the war; it is a fucking LIE
Russia has to finish this operation as soon as possible!
To je zmatečné zpravodajství! 😢
Russia just finished the job , the criminal gang of eu us wont stop there criminal activities
Kellogg said Ukraine is winning the war! It looks like the opposite is true! 😂
But according to Ukraine, only 10 drones hit Ukraine. Must be only minor damage.
What ?  Russia has new shovels to fight with ?    The New York Times says they're almost out of shovels .........
Ukraine is forced to light up dormant substations exposing them to thermal imagery. Gonna get worse
Thank you
Slava Russia
Everything EAST OF DNIPRO WILL BE RUSSIAN
Дай Бог!
Ukrainians believe in the lies.  Ukrainians believe Zelensky is working for them.  So when it becomes so devastating that Ukrainians no longer believe any type of victory is remotely possible, then Zelensky will load up his suitcases full of money and drive his new Bentley to Italy.
I guess 'neutrality' is too long for Zelensky to pronounce, or write. Stubborn tool!
Nu știu de ce dar în ultima perioadă nu mai funcționează subtitrarea în limba română. Vă rog faceți ceva dacă se poate.
Ukraine is just another victim of the west. The world should wake up
Most of Ukrainians against there government and scared to say that nobody wants to be end up in jail or killed.  And a lot of Ukrainian soldiers surrender because they dont want to fight for there drug addicted overdue president. Its just west propaganda brain washing there people
This is a good start. The weather will only get colder. And the  lack of energy and electricity will help accelerate the end of the Zelenski regime.
Russia is gaining momentum!
Thank you 👍🏻
Does Trump still think their a paper tiger?
There's a suggestion that Russia may test the Osina RV missile, which was resurrected from its development hibernation in 2023
Never be a pawn of the west, particularly US
Wow! The works of great russia.
Poor little (opps plucky) green  T-shirt  will never see blackouts etc etc & etc.  He will of course make sure that his off-shore banks accounts are never affected.  Meanwhile the normal working Ukrainian ?
If trump gives us the tomahawk missiles thus the ability to kill people  we will nominate him for the nobel peace  prize.....  what are they drinking there ?
The fact that Putin announced a much larger weapon may explain why the lastest Russian missile strikes on the Ukraine energy infrastructure are to de-populate large areas of the civilian population before dropping a city killer like their SATAN II  missile ...maybe ??? I hope that doesn't happen
Stop the genocide now Stop the genocide now Now Trump
Crimea Ukraine is historically old Russian Ancetral land
Love how those western thieves are just stealing money and meanwhile telling everyone that Russia is loosing but we need more money for Ukraine.  Ukranian soldiers if you are smart march back to Kiev and loose a current government
Love all Russian people and a special those who fight for freedom and against Green goblin.
Russia and his allies may not like to admit it, but now that Trump is providing western weapons. It’s just a matter of time for Russia loses
🇷🇺💪💪🇷🇺
As always top notch reporting Dima and MSC team, thank you!
According to US own military doctrine, “Shock and awe” is legit.
Military you are the best channel. Thank you!
Ukraians are NOT loosing the grounds. Infact Moscow seems to be too far to get too.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🇷🇺🫡🇷🇸
It matters what you do in this life as we continue after our body dies. We are greater than this atrocity of killing. How many dads and sons have died, how many people who loved. Shame on those that caused this war of no winners. We’re all going to die because of this. Is that what you want, the decimation of all life on Earth? Who are we, this generation to decide this? Why did we have children to watch them burn? The End can be stopped. It is time for those who are parents, who love their children to stop this.
Time to launch the knockout blow now!
