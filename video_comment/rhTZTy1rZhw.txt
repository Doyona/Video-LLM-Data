After reading the book this video has a new meaning
Kindred was giving the afterlife , showing war sacrifice, fight amnesia was accepting her fate! Mel Said wake up!
i just realise ambessa got a music vid voice by Ms Howard XDD
This music video is insanely good !!
This is my fav league music video.
am i watching arcane the musical
Let's hope she can perform for the 2026 world's final.
Barbra Howard from Abbott elementary sang this btw
hi
This is how Mrs. Howard sound like when she's angry..
Une voie de folle furieuse, j'aime beaucoup 😁
I hope this song will be performed at this year's finals opening ceremony. That would be epic!
this song really doesn't have many views huh...
Cacare
So Mel saved ambessa and is that why ambessa says at the end of her life to Mel “you are the wolf”??
I ain’t seen this in arcane, cool
This is just the best expression of art.
Ambessa though 🫠🥵🥴😵‍💫 3:08 - 3:12 is my favorite scene
Sheryl tore this song up, still gives me chills
Kino holding the sacrificial lamb is a gut punch
Fine, I'll watch Arcane again.
can someone pls explain ? i watched arcane but i don't play lol so i'm really confused here
Just found out the singer is Ms Howard from "Abbott Elementary" 😮 !!!
very cool
I've seen shorts with this scene and after I watched this 3:03 I realized two things: 1. That's not a real person 2. That's a woman!
her voice ❤❤❤❤❤
I still cannot believe this song is sung by the same woman that plays Ms. Howard
Reading the book explains a whole lot
better than sacrifice
She got stabbed by the spear in the same place she knifed Caitlyn. Symbolic of how she was trying to mould her into her own image?
I love this
So good :3
Sett and ambessa went through similar things. Except sett grasped at his loved ones and did the fighting for the love of it and enjoyment. While ambessa was fighting with pure hatred and bitterness in her heart. She doesn't like it, but she is forced to accept it. Meanwhile sett just accepts that's life and just goes with it. Ambessa tried so hard to keep her innocence(lamb doll) but by grasping at it, while sett never lost it while not even thinking about it
Take notes Disney..this is representation
Man, this makes so much more sense after starting the Ambessa book
Really amazing ❤
esto explica el nacimiento de mell
This is probably one of the most powerful pieces of art I’ve ever seen in my life. Magnificent
Barbara killin' it!!
❤❤❤❤😊🎉🎉🎉
I am here almost every day, multiple times a day.
pulling out at arrow is a deathsentence. just saying :)
should have ben a male champ
yeah riot, yeah
É BOM DEMAIS VEY     Mas ainda não vou jogar lol, desiste riot
En el minuto 3:37 se puede ver a mel brillar dentro de su vientre
I was raised by wolves I was born to lead And I starve 'til there's no more mouths to feed There's a hand on my throat And a blade at my feet But the weight of the world Won't bend my knees Broken bones, battle scars I've seen the bloodshed Carved in stone, when it's my sword They won't forget No war, no peace 'til I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know I can use who I want And I taste what I please In this world I get all my fantasies There's a hand on my throat And a child at my feet But the weight of the world Won't bend my knee No war, no peace 'til I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know Don't wash away my blood Don't wash away my sweat It's all I know Don't wash away my tears Don't wash away, don't wash away Don't wash my spirit Don't cleanse my soul Can't break my courage And I won't fall 'Cause that's all I know No war, no peace 'til I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know
Vai sair a história dessa mulher não?
Is it just me or is she pregnant like look at the beginning of the video her stomach😮
❤️❤️❤️❤️
This song is SO POWERFUL.
me with my 2 pound weight
Beautiful voice! Greetings from Ukraine.
Ganondorf and Ambessa would make a lovely couple.
The singer is from abbott elementary (recent work), but she is a legend OG Dreamgirl.
This should have been a Bond song. As it is is legendary no less
Ah yes, actual animation beauty and not AI! And my favorite animated mv! 🌈🌈🙌🏽🙌🏽
"Wow such a great cinematic I think I'm gonna play league" don't even think about it
so sigma
y'all have to watch Blood Sweat & Tears it covers part of Ambessa past
Why Anyone in Riot Is Better Than Game Devs 💀
This was kinda dumb.
The only reason this wasn't in the show is because they know we would have been rooting for the noxians if they did include it
So poor Ambesa had to fight and went through all this sheet just so Riot can say:Nope that was all Mell
обьясните мне, как это сопоставить с аркейном?
Why didn't Ambessa choose the sheep? It would've saved us the grievance and sadness. Man, Arcane is so heartbreaking.
Esse se tornou um dos meus favoritos da Riot
聽到這首歌時，剛好在玩競技場模式 我選角用勇氣，系統給安比薩 因此一邊循環這首歌，一邊作戰  被對手法洛士擊殺時，小安比薩也中箭躺在地上 中間有輸有贏，但是後半段的時候我方只剩一次的機會，輸了就結束遊戲 後面每一把我方的對戰，都是關鍵的生死局，可是剩下的對手最少都還有兩次的機會 而暫時排名第一的隊伍還有龍族之心、跟末日預言，而他們也是最後一場的對手 可以說戰況越久對我方越不利    在如此艱難的情況下，安比薩始終沒有倒下 最後的一場對戰，更是困難重重 隊友先被擊倒的情況下，安比薩要孤軍奮戰 可即使如此，也無法粉碎安比薩鬥志 她完成了反殺，甚至對手的C位被復活，依舊阻擋不了，安比薩對勝利的渴望 她力挽狂瀾，扳倒了雄偉的巨像 加里歐  她站到了最後，成為了競技場的勝利者
Oe bro se que andamos de basados pero se te colo uno no sé si sabes cuál es..

I like to think the lamb represents Ambessa's innocence, once she let go/lost it she grew and finally took the throne as shown
If she is indeed with child, this definitely shows how pregnancy changes a body. She goes from having a toned body that many women would die for to having a bigger build than the Hulk!
Good song for gym
I need Sheryl Lee Ralph to release a whole album with this kinda vibe
Underrated
I loooove the creature designs in this video!
Literally Riot Games bringing respect to each and every character in LoL.
slay, mrs howard
Most normal mom lore drop.
1:08 "Go home, Brokies" Lmao
Куда беременная поперлась 🤦🏻‍♀️???
I think this song is a bit burnt. They cooked too hard.
If they make a movie I pray they let Sheryl actor as Ambessa 🙏💯
This video didn't get the views it deserved.
fun fact, when caitlyn kiraman gets betrayed by maddie and the entrance of masked ambessa shows, the backup vocals is the music that plays
I know we have book that covers kinda everything about Ambessa, and I can't imagine what else could be added there, but I'm so in love with this character that I still wish there would be more
🎵NO WAR🎵
*Gasp*.........LOREE
Arcane couldve been a musical with this one being sang by Ambessa while training Cait 😂
pantheon be aura farming fr fr
Lamb to the slaughter
Ambessa backstory is pog
top dms 😍
Кто заметил Свейна  и Катарину??
that baby in her wombs is mel
Não entendo porque essa obra de arte não tem pelomenos 100 milhões de visualização?
RIOT STOP BE ACTING SUCH AS CHRISTOPHER NOLAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNN
My favorite part is everyone jokes about all the anime lookin pop singer legends but then riot doubles down and actually makes these bangers. Love you guys. Love all the Legends. Pop off ❤
Esse video é muito foda.
Nice video, very well done, and the music fits well.
Ambessa's such a badass!! I love her!!
Onde milion
Verme
Speed 1.25x sounds great
PAIN
Ambessa medarda they could never make me hate you
ini studio game apa music si.. 😂
I wish Ambessa would have gotten a way better death she was so badass the entire Arcane and she died like nothing with the black rose (in my opinion)
The music's good but the game isnt
I don't play League of Legends, but personally this woman always inspires me.
This gives me heavy The Immortals vibes, the one with Henry Cavill?
you know, the lamb might actually represent Mel being shaped by the Wolf god. There are theories that the wolf was actually there for Mel, since she's a mage, but she's just a baby, and so Ambessa took her place in the trials. Ambessa survived and in turn Mel. and the eyes glowing and Ambessa waking up was the result- being Mel's actual mage-ification.
Iran vs Israel
This was THE best lure drop of all time. Lemme tell you- I also hated Ambessa, until this mv! WHAT A WOMAN 🤩
FOR NOXUS❤
Ambessa Medarda is the sheep in wolves clothes but Mel Medarda is THE WOLF in the sheep's clothes
I can't count the number of times I've watched this, she's so AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
THEY RELEASED ONE OF THE ARCANE ANIMATORS FROM BASEMENT FINALLY!!
Kindred 's wolf mask?.. i haven't played League of Legends for a very long time now.
Repertoar. You?
quem é essa?
Just piece of art
Arcane : Wolf ot fox  Me : bear
A very emotional cinematic this time and wow lore! I never knew sage would be crystalize everytime she resurrect someone, or is it?
2:26 "stand up, face me again"
This is how you write and embody a badass strong woman. And only this way.
3:43 Why do characters always pull out the arrow instead of breaking the shaft? isnt that what you're supposed to do?
That growl at 3:05...wow
After reading the book this all hits on a completely different level. Honestly the whole second season of Arcane now got a new layer
Adrenalina.
Had a chill talk with Wolf (that fight with that Pantheon looking guy), Lamb wen't "Aight, you got the guts. BUT, your kid may inherit some side effects from this time you evaded death."
where is the baby ?🤔
gosh i love her
Esto es video clip de Ambesa de joven ¿no? nunca saldra en la tempordad de Noxus?
I've seen Arcane, but otherwise, I'm a few years behind on the lore. What did I just watch?
Sheep. The way she carried that lamb is tragic..
Me vine, es cine
Que temazo
I'll take this song to my grave, I love it so much :")
today on the news: local noxian women is to angry to die
J E S U S Street name CHRIST
I can't believe I haven't watched the MV until now! This completely levels up Ambessa's character. The imagery of having to let go and destroy the lamb-which represents the peace and innocence inside her-is so heartbreaking because she didn't want to let go of it either. She wanted to protect it until she couldn't, and she cried at losing that part of herself.
The Animators really did justice with the video.  Homage to Ambessa
A lore de LOL é interessantíssima, mas essas referências aí são complicadas .... cabrito dourado (bezerro de ouro), deserto, demônios, Deus sol Rá ou Apolo e Anúbis também, referências claras a passagem de gênesis, qnd o povo de Israel sai do Egito e enquanto Moisés recebias as Tábuas, o povo fazia o bezerro deste mesmo tamanhho de ouro para adorar. Qual a referência que os caras quiseram trazer? Quero entender melhor
it is so cool how it sounds like Ambessa is singing this
medically: dont ever pull that arrow in that situation! 10/10
가사 어디서봄
"cause thats alll i knooooow" Oh my god that is giving me absolute chills. What an immense voice
Anyone else crying to this song? ^^*  Idk this hits smth deep inside of me
stop doing these with irrelevant champions 🤦🤦
After reading the Ambessa book this may be the coolest thing I’ve ever seen ❤
Shett gdt down powerful nlxus om triste campeón
Lady Zeroni said if you you can carry the pig up the mountain today why can’t you do it tomorrow, to bad yelnats forgot where his first step was.
When you hear the "no war" scream in the background at 3:13 for the first time and realize how artistically and expertly it was handled and delivered in the following seconds, you just get heavy chills and cannot unhear it anymore, then it becomes the only thing you can hear/focus on in that specific moment of the song.  To be frank, when I first heard it, I can't say I really liked the song. I listened to it only twice and never played it again. Then it played in shuffle one day and I can now confidently say that its a masterpiece.
Ambessa Rainha Mãe 🔥🔥❤❤
i love the kindred as both a champ and a concept so much, seeing them in these cinematics brings a huge joy to my face.
ARCANE FANS read Ambessa's book Chosen Of The Wolf!!!!!  The book literally opens on this exact scene from her pov. Its revealed that she was pregnant with Mel here, this battle happened because Ambessa insisted on having her child behind the walls of her childhood village (but its people weren't welcoming to a Medarda) something like that. Ambessa was in labor here.  Seriously, its a good book even if you aren't a reader! Got my copy at Walmart.
WTF ??? AMMiM????    Reply   @ArukiTsukaru 2 days ago 3:18 Red Skull and the Tesseract    Reply   @Bri-j3s 6 days ago (edited) I have a theory!. Since Isha, Ambassa and Heimerdinger died The only thing they had in common is that they all have theme songs. That means if an New arcane character has a theme song and it’s only about them, They’re going to die. Am I right or am I wrong? I’m just saying. But I don’t know if I count Heimedinger’s death because his species (Yordles)are known to be immortal soo…I don’t know. And I’m still not sure if Isha is really dead or not.  1   Reply   1 reply  @ShadowVex-Valorant 7 days ago In Ethiopian language "ambessa" means lion ( with no fear )  5   Reply   1 reply  @comercialrosa74 7 days ago BTS    Reply   @Dasvek_7 8 days ago es increíble que no le haya dado like ni bien salio    Reply   @V4mp1r_TvT 8 days ago Young ambessa looks pretty ngl  3   Reply   @EgoCarry1 8 days ago Ah this must be the first chapter in the Ambessa book  4   Reply   @nadirbousd4444 9 days ago YOO THIS IS KINDRED AT 2:44 I JUST NOTICED IT    Reply   @Mr.Garvey_likes_A-A-ron 10 days ago the book is so good!  1   Reply   @cymraegddraig 10 days ago This song deserves more than 12mil views.

3:18 Red Skull and the Tesseract
In Ethiopian language "ambessa" means lion ( with no fear )
BTS
es increíble que no le haya dado like ni bien salio
Young ambessa looks pretty ngl
Ah this must be the first chapter in the Ambessa book
YOO THIS IS KINDRED AT 2:44 I JUST NOTICED IT
the book is so good!
This song deserves more than 12mil views. Epic
Ambessa to Mel : "You are the wolf" make sense
mano que musica massa se loko
No fear or sorrows underneath these bones
Sheryl Lee Ralph is the Wolf.
Any and ALL of you are scum, try it. PROVE ME WRONG, just try not to get WORD UPPED, Jew brains, what?
man, after reading the novel, reading the lines, and knowing exactly which scenes it describes, I appreciate it even more
I don't care how many people riot sends, I am not playing league of legends
When he holds her at the end and her expression and the color grading changes 😭
For anyone else wondering what the heck is going on in this video, it’s an adaptation of the prologue of the Ambessa book, Chosen of the Wolf, showing a series of flashbacks/hallucinations Ambessa goes through there
Masterpiece
As much of a power hungry dog as Ambassa was, u can’t deny that she is very badass
1:39 LITERALLY THE BEST PART
1:40
Bones will be grinded, bloods will be spilled, tears will be shed, but in the end, only Noxus will stand
Who is here again after Ambessa: Chosen of the wolf?
Ее шрамы светятся золотом. Похоже на японское  искусство кинцуги. И ее жизнь тоже подходит - шрамы украшают Амбессу. Они сделали ее той кто она есть. А ребенок с овечкой напомнил Клариссу Старлинг из молчания ягнят, там тоже вроде ягнята означают невинность
Eyyyy Ambessas story
Absolute Cinema!
Beautiful song, beautiful vocal
So what now, is Pantheon the father of Mel or what ... Riot, we need answers
Ah yes, I'mma just casually watch this video a hundred more times. 🤣
Imagine if league of legends was a third person adventure linear game while these kinda songs play emotionally in different parts of the game during the story while these cgi scenes are located between boss intros.
Whos behind ambessa besides pantheon? Is it katarian with her blades and maybe darius with his axe? And swain...? Idk
I came back to this vid and now I have a total different perspective of it. Maybe when, in the limbo, we see Ambesa gives her baby to become the maighty warrior she proyects, she belived that she was choosen for the wolf and then she pursues that goal thinking that's her destiny. But what she dont know is that her baby is the chosen of the wolf. This is what gives to Mel her arcane powers as we can see in the end with her eyes glowing. Some details that I see now is that the wolf seems to be looking for ambesa, but for his expressions it feels like he is looking for the baby. Another thing is that when ambessa dies in Arcane and says "You are the wolf" she realized that the choosen wasn´t never her, it was Mel.
3:40 just noticed, that's the same theme they used when Ambessa was going up the stairs on the last episode
You mean to tell me the singer here and Barb from Abbott Elementary are the same person? 🤯🤯🤯
jayzuz this is going to be a amazing story arc ... keep it up
Badass with a big fat B
Me duele, me quema, me lastima 😩
Ambesa FOUR minutes of unseen footage and timebomb get 2 minutes of the same dance from the show plus a hug  A hug bro🤦🏻🤦🏻
1:47 “In this world, I get all my fantasies” while she’s *_giving up_* the lamb is an interesting juxtaposition, showing that to get all her fantasies, she had to give up that innocence and softness. I really, really love that.
new?
瘋掉！ 還給我對唱 摟抱 好喜歡 可惡
Now that I've read the Ambessa novel (which exactly begins with the scenes from this video), the song and video are even more incredible and full of emotions to me 🥹
Sing barb singg
Ooooh this hits *different* after the prologue of the Ambessa book *^*
i actually don`t get why here is only 12m views. Highly underrated in my opinion. The style is not usual for Riot, the voice is so good and all fits each other. The sinematic also made good. I would like to see here at least 100m+ but unfortunate.
The power in this song, makes me cry all the time.
PLEASE MAKE THE AMBESSA BOOK A SPIN-OFF SERIES OF ARCANE I BEG YOU
Mel siempre fue la elegida del lobo, se nota cuando le brillan los ojos e hizo que ambessa no muera
Do nada um baterista hahahahahahahaha nada a ver
This one's on the list
I just watched this while stoned out of my mind and I am geeking out the visuals are so good. Also I might throw up
so cool that is the prolog of her book, wow
I have no idea what’s going on here, but I like it.
hmm..I feel like conquering
Женщина с огромной буквой. АМБЕССА ❤️‍🔥
The more I watch this video, the more I'm convinced that the warrior/woman we see at 3:25 Isn't  Ambessa but her daughter, a older  version of Mel merdarda leading Noxus against the black rose.
Guys , what if Riot make LoL  hero-shooter like overwatch and Rivals 😮😮😮
panteon se cojio a ambessa y de alli salio mel con poderes de brillitos
Blood, sweat, tears and 200 years
Woke champion, woke cinematic 🤢🤮🤮
This Music is Perfect
her daughter was the one who was protecting her from dying.
GJ RIOT GJ
3:11 I’m the stairs
CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHERE TO WATCH THIS
did she sacrifice her son to be where she is...😮😮😮
God she’s a badass.  I ain’t religious but I’d kneel at her alter.
sad to see it how stagnating company rothing alive
Its my favorite song from all of League of Legends. (Yes I have heard Rise and Legends Never Die).
Just read the prologue of the Ambessa novel and wow this video makes a lot more sense!
This video is FACKING INCREDIBLE ! Congrats to the whole team!
sigo sin entenderpor que ambessa estando embarazada se iria a la guerra aun sabiendo que ella y el/la bebe podrian morir en batalla :V
Love it
This being covered in the new novel is pretty sick, actually
i love villain in arcane they all have very good reason.  They dont care if they have to put the world on fire to acheive theyre objective cause they are sure they have the best reason to fight.
Anyone gonna talk about how cool those tall drummer things are?
The stilt walking drummers are so cool
Cinema
I still want to think that Kindred is Mordekaiser's Psychopomp and he sends out the Wolf to put the Dying into a trial and the worthy will be welcomed to the Grey realm. While those are not will be sent to the Kindred's pocket realm
I feel stronger listening to this song
Can someone PLEAASEEE model the Lamb shes holding and that blue Wolf-stone thing ?    I want them 3D printed !
Who else came back to watch the video after reading the novel? Raise ur hand ✋✋✋
I feel like the moments where we see her with all the strange figures where she holds a lamb and then the moments where we see her fighting the chosen almost feel like it shows two sides of ambessa, her more vulnerable/innocent side and her warrior like side, and in the sequence, it somewhat felt like she was trying to keep ahold of both of them, her vulnerable self aka the lamb being shattered repeatedly but repairing as well was her trying to hold on still, and her fighting side trying her best but was failing, she eventually realized in order to protect those around her and survive, she needed to sacrifice her innocence, thus sacrificing the lamb in order to strengthen herself and become a warrior that can achieve what she needs.
Why am i crying
The Ambessa novel gives this music video so much context.
was the lamb she sacrificed representing Kino? omg.. so many questions
Can't wait to see Sheryl Lee Ralph perform at the World!
Her sacrificing Mel (the lamb) 😢
This most be the best song in arcane
nice try riot I'll never play again lol. I left the first day Vanguard started working, it was the straw that broke the camel's back, I'm sorry
The way Sheryl Lee Ralp ATE. She is ducking legendary!
Ambessa is the goat
After reading the prologue the Ambessa book it just makes this experience so much better
Song : i been raise by wolf My ear : i been ra*e by wolf
Wow
Başyapıt
I was raised by wolves I was born to lead And I starve till there's no more mouths to feed There's a hand on my throat And a blade at my feet But the weight of the world won't bend my knees  Broken bones, battle scars I have seen the bloodshed Carved in stone, when it's my sword They won't forget  No war, no peace Till I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know  I can use who I want And I taste what I please In this world I get all my fantasies There's a hand on my throat And a child at my feet But the weight of the world Won't bend my knees  No war, no peace Till I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know  (Don't wash away my blood) (Don't wash away my sweat) It's all I know (Don't wash away my tears)  Don't wash my spirit Don't cleanse my soul Can't break my courage And I won't fall ’Cause that's all I know  No war, no peace Till I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know

Whoever did this song should be rewarded
Back here after reading the Ambessa prequel prologue and oh, man! This makes even more sense now!
Were those xeraths cultists? at 1:35
Yall the book was released on audiuble the VA for ambessa is the person reading the book. I just finished the prologue and it starts with this music video!
This sounds like To Ashes and Blood but upgraded
Who's also rewatching after reading the book?
she sacrifice her son for a personal profit but her daughter steal her power you can see Ambessa was sacrifing her son that was represent by the lamb dismantle at 2:50 to be a part of an object that was absorb after by Ambessa to became more strong but at 3:33 we can see the power of Ambessa represent by the shining gold being pump by the baby who is Mel sorry for my bad english
Ambessa mean Lion CMIW and she sang like the roar of a lion 🦁
Blood sweat and tears to get hextech chests back
OMG I love this song so much!!! Sheryl Lee Ralph sang her butt off on this song! Ambessa's strength, determination power comes through-this is a powerful song! The line "the weight of this world won't bend my knee" omg I love this song!
Ok, you all like telling histories about powerful women but when it comes to a woman with a dream to compete in League of legends I don't see the same. I want to show how much i can do and so many girls too. I'm a brasilian one and we don't have support to do the same as the boys. That's really sad but as Ambessa and so many female characters I'll show you that I'm unstoppable! One day, I'll see Faker face to face!
Such a empowering song love it to bits chiefs kiss on this one 🧑‍🍳💋
❤❤
I CANNOT STOP WATCHING THIS
Hey ambessa is traing con panteon?
I know she'll die, but I don't want her to regardless. She resonates with something I can't put to words yet
U BETTER LOVE WHAT YOU SEE!
This affected me so much!!!
I'm a new fan of League, and this definitely helped. 🐺🐑
Is Riot Games seriously trying to make us feel bad for her???
Crazy no one noticed Swain 👀
Cool , Where is my hextech chest ??
0:00 2:00
That "League of Legends" logo at the end of the video looked so much like the D&D logo.
PLEASE DO WE HAVE THE SHERYL LEE RALPH STUDIO MV VERSION
This genuinely is worse than the thick of it
Yo!! Is this young Ambessa? This is so cool! I am just letting YouTube play videos on its own and then it played this one. And I’m thinking, hmm, she looks kind of like Mel but that’s not Mel. And then I see the wolves. And then I put two and two together. 😮
❤
ok crazy but what if the black rose gave ambessa her throne? it kind of seems like the black rose made a deal with ambessa, cant wait to find out more about her backstory and why shes so afraid of the black rose
Ambessa was weak.  She was never a wolf, and this series will fail and burn.
fire
who is her?
Its said that during her dying moments ambessa realized that the real wolves were the hextech chests
wait swain and Catarina are with pantheon, why?
Talking about hitting the right tone for this character. This song was meant for her.
It's so interesting to see Ambessa with a young, almost gentle face. She's still obviously very strong and has seen some battles but it's such a far cry from the smug and hardened warlord we meet in Arcane
Ambessa, the Kratos of LoL
Hextech chests...
Как докатилась ЛоЛ до того, что у себя показывают видео про то как тяжело бедным темнокожим, как их угнетают злые угнетатели, даже в ФЭНТЕЗИ мире!?! Как ежегодные шедевры превратились в ЭТО?! Грустно смотреть, как что-то столь эпичное скатывается в унылую (всех доставшую) повесточку.
Once again Riot Games proves that if it was an animation company instead of a game company, the world would be a better place
Lidar
Dude she looks like ambessa. İs this ambessa?
What is that wolf at the beginning? I mean, is it a murk wolf or what?
Anyone here 2025? ❤
nice song
Riot needs to chill, I already loved Ambessa I didn’t need a whole music video to give me another reason to love her
When Ambessa got chosen by Kindred, she kinda look like Mel when transforming for a sec there. With golden markings in the body similar to Mel  Maybe hinting into Mel's power origin
Did you notice that Ambessas' out fit is similar to what Mel's out fit when she gets her magical powers? But the factor was once innocent and vulnerable is crazy but was the relationship with the goat or sheep she held?
Where are my Hextech chests??
"I'll starve till there are no more mouths to feed" Such a powerful line... I love how they show her strength as a matriarch rather than some imitation of a male warlord
I had no idea Barb had pipes like this. The texture and husk to her voice is so beautiful oml I'm tearing up
Y a pas de mots assez fort pour vous féliciter. Vous avez fait rêver tant de gens. Je vous souhaite pleins de réalisations exceptionnelles à venir. Vraiment bravo à vous tous
Damn....I got more respect for Ambessa now fr
the whole trailer was good except that one cring part
Its kindred and emmbsa
Ambessa is such a badass, gosh!!! I wish we could get to learn more about her in Arcane.
I can't wait to read the book and continue this story about her vision and all her story before Arcane. 😆 Actually this looks like a teaser of the book than a teaser for arcane 2 🤔.
JODER, que temazo se fue a lanzar ambessa
The lamb representing Kino being sacrificed </3
I can't believe it's Miss Barbara from Abbot Elementary who is singing this
when did Bangalore from apex joind league ?
Kino is the Lamb, isn't he? : (
But the weight of the world Won't bend my knees  – the best lyrics of 2025.
The voice, the animation, the direction, the effects, the narrative told in this video... This is perfect, pure art, i can stay seeing this all day. A role models for me.
I like Mel’s eyes lighting up at the end there
That was the most metal depiction of Kindred throughout.  A literal wolf, that warrior with the shield (the shield made a wolfs face if you didn't catch it), the little metal lamb and a VERY dark incarnation of lamb at the end.
Belíssima!! Mas cade o bau hextec?
Quanta sofferenza però.... I noxiani si ispirano a uno di quei popoli di cui gli annunaki si sono occupati. Gli somigliani molto.
Can we get another Chrissy Costanza video?  She's my favorite person.  I think she represents League well too <3 :)
We need ctrl5 mask for ambessa into the league
My new favorite vocal from the League universe.
Get back the chests!!
I've just noticed the implication that some part of what drove the death away at that scene is Mel's presence.
It still remains an absolutely badass music video with amazing storytelling
Beatiful song voice
It is kind of poetic that she saw her son holding the lamb, after she sacrificed it. In Arcane she said she doomed one child to protect other.
arcane ruin ambessa's true power
my favourite workout music these days  hitting PR using this
So can someone explain this I understand she was one the verge of death but did she literally rage against the darkness. Despite the pain she was going through she simply refused to die not only to save her life but the life of her unborn child and through countless failures she eventually bested kindred and was allowed a second chance at the life she nearly threw away?
apparently Mel was choosen by the wolf❤❤❤❤ not Ambessa although she was greatest character in history
Devuelvan los cofres hexteck
Kino is the sacrificial lamb
The lamb symbolizes willingness to accept death, which she at first was clinging to. Wolf chases those who run from death. She fights the Aspect of War (Pantheon), and chooses to reject death out of sheer force of will.
MELS MAGIC IS WHAT SAVED HER LIFE 😱
You can see Ambessa's armour is shining yellow here-which is the same colour of Mel's protection skill 3:33
Ok I have a question aren't chosen of the wolf supposed to become magically gifted or something?
ANSWERS.
ANSWERS.
Why ambessa did not die here, she became the wolf, or the kindred spared and sustained her granting her the status of the wolf, why she died in arcane? Probably because kindred passed that status to Mel. And Ambessa already knew about her death and gladly went for it so the medarda army will he led by her daughter, and ambessa will be out of the equation and the black rose will deal with someone more powerful than ambessa
Hello Riot, just wondering if you are gonna upload her champion theme on YouTube!
Love the song, but what's going on with the soundtrack from 3:25 to 3:27?
How many times have you watched this?  Me: Yes
Who is this diva
This was too stupid. I love mel medarda far more than thios travesty. This antics of riots is leading them down the hill. Medarda? There was no other champion from arcane other than medarda. I´ll love to see the fishman cop or more about the young girl with jynx. Or the ziko assistent. The one with the bionic arm. Those i´ll love to see far more than medarda. I guess someone in riot is truly into this character which in reality has no value to me at least.
I hope my comment will reach to 1k likes and it would mean a lot 🥹
2025 anyone 🎉
I love that Ambessa is the only one without a mask on, just like the wolf. This is so powerful I feel it in my bones.
If everyone that is in the kindred realm is someone that fought the kindred and won. Why tryndamere is not there
Ya'll let a pregnant lady on the battle field? Really?!
of course it's a black woman lmao
2025 🙂‍↔️
I HAVE BEEN SLEEPING ON THIS OMG 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
이 영상은 아케인3에 있어 중요한 내용들을 보여준다고 본다. 암베사에게 다가오는 '죽음(킨드레드)'은 환상을 체험시켜준다. 환상은 타곤을 연상케 하며 판테온성위 뒤로는 스웨인과 카타리나가 있다. 이 부분은 스킨을 홍보하기 위한 화면으로 생각할 수 있지만, 꼭 그렇지만도 않다. 우리는 스웨인과 카타리나는 녹서스의 최정상 권력자들 중 하나로 알 수있다. 암베사의 무의식에 내재된 두려움의 대상들, 즉 녹서스의 강자들이 바로 앞의 판테온 성위처럼 넘어서야할 벽처럼 묘사된거라 생각한다. 저 모습들이 암베사에게 있어 스웨인과 카타리나가 아니더라도 말이다.(우리에게는 스킨홍보의 목적으로 스웨인과 카타리나임을 알 수있지만 말이다.)   암베사는 킨드레드를 통해 판테온과의 수련을 체험한다. 이 환상은 마치 타곤 꼭대기를 배경을 생각케한다. 암베사와 타곤의 연관성이 있는걸까? 시즌2에서 멜은 르블랑으로부터 출생에 관한 의미심장한 말들을 듣는다.  그리고 멜은 시즌1 마지막화에서 솔라리 문양을 연상케하는 문신을 보여준다. 그리고 실제 인게임 스킬설명에 '태양'이 언급된다.   선천적으로 멜에게 부여된 특별한 힘은 타곤과 연관이 있을거라 생각하고, 이는 암베사가 타곤에서 무슨 일이 있지 않았을까 하는 추측으로 이어질 수 있다. 본 영상에서는 환상으로 체험하게 되지만, 환상은 암시가 되어 실제로 암베사가 훗날 타곤에 갈지도 모르는거다.  그렇게 타곤에 간 암베사가 어떠한 일을 겪음으로써 '멜'을 임신했을거라 추측하는게 나의 주장이며, 이 영상의 가장 중요한 포인트라고 본다.  왜 굳이 이 영상을 '넷플릭스'채널에도 보여줬을까? 이는 리그오브레전드ip 홍보 목적도 있겠지만, 시즌2를 기점으로 나온 이 영상은 아케인의 이야기를 보충해주기 때문이라고 본다. 그리고 왜 '죽음(킨드레드)'는 암베사에게 환상을 체험하게 해줬을까? 마치 이것은 '기회'를 준 것처럼 보이며, '운명'을 부여한 것처럼 보인다. 그리고 타곤의 환상을 체험하는 암베사가 늑대에게 선택 받으면서 동시에 태중의 아기를 보여준다. 이 아기가 멜이라는 것을 짐작할 수 있다. 그런데 왜 이 타이밍에 멜을 보여주는 것일까? 그리고 일반적이지 않은 임신은 마치 성경에 나오는 성모마리아를 모티브로 따온 것 같은 생각이 든다. 타곤의 성위는 초월적인 존재이며, 그 존재로부터 생명을 잉태한 암베사.  암베사는 이러한 일을 겪음에도 '영웅'이 되지 않았다. 오히려 한 나라를 멸망시키며 죽음을 몰고다닌 학살자에 가까웠다. 이는 암베사를 위한 일이 아니라, 태중에 있을 '멜'을 위한 것이라 추측한다. 암베사에게 '늑대'가 되는 법을 가르쳐줌으로써, 멜을 '늑대'로 만들어줄 역할을 부여한 것이다.  아무 능력이 없음에도 늑대에 선택 된 암베사는 '멜'을 가질 자격이 있었다고 보며, 암베사를 통해 '멜'을 세상에 나오게 하려는 의도가 아니었나 생각한다.  이 영상은 25년 시네마틱과 이어진다. 이 영상의 마지막과 시네마틱의 첫부분은 같은 배경으로, 암베사에서 멜로 이어진다 볼 수 있다. 이 이야기는 마치 구약과 같은 암베사의 이야기지만, 이후의 이야기는 '재림'을 한 신약과 같은 멜의 이야기가 된다고 생각한다.  이러한 특별한 출생의 비밀은 간직하고 있는 멜은 타곤과 연관된다면, 곧 '성위'를 연상하게 된다.   멜의 특별함은 타곤의 성위로 부터 온 것이라 추측 할 수 있으며, 아케인3에서 멜의 이야기가 진행되기로 예정 되었으니, 멜은 아직 완전히 각성한 것이 아니며 아케인3 혹은 아케인4에서 진정한 성위로서 각성하는 모습이 나올거라 생각한다. 이는 곧 르블랑이 이용하려는 '아타칸'과의 충돌을 연상 할 수 있게된다.  필트오버에서 이방인 출신이며, 녹서스에서도 이방인 출신이 되는 멜은 '악마'를 내쫓음으로써 본인을 증명할 것이다.  어쩌면 삼두의 마지막 자리는 멜일지도 모른다.  '아타칸'을 저지하는 멜을 보며, 르블랑은 분노하기보다 생각을 전환 할지도 모른다. '아타칸'은 모데카이저에 대항하기 위한 수단이다. 그런데 멜이 이 '아타칸'을 제압한다면 모데카이저에 대항하기 위한 새로운 길을 볼지도 모르기 때문이다.  이는 르블랑이 '성위'와의 접촉을 기대할지도 모르는 그림이 된다.   그 자체로 강력한 영향력을 행사하는  '룬' 룬의 부작용으로 발현하게 되는 이세계의 통로. 그 너머에 있는 치명적인 존재 '공허' 초월자들과 다르킨 악마와 성위 우주적 존재  아직 리그오브레전드ip에는 많은 이야기들이 남아있다.
I loved how in the flashes of the person we *think* is Ambessa before shots of fetus Mel, they have Mel's distinctive golden neck markings/tattoos. These little details MAKE compelling story telling. In those scenes, that might not even be Ambessa we see all golden and powerful, but maybe a look at future Mel.
The virtue signaling is wild
3:37 - 3:39  does this mean than Ambessa survive thanx Mel?
Is this made by fortiche too?
Ambessa is about to die. She met the wolf on the battlefield and met the sheep in her dream, she fought to keep Mel stay alive in her belly, the so the wolf spared her life. Each culture of Runeterra has an icon dedicated to Kindred. That's so great.
this changed my view on Ambessa from the series, she's such a POWERFUL woman I LOVE HER SM TY FOR THIS VIDEO ALWAYS EATING WITH SONGS
All about LOL is god, apart from the game
россияне - встанем за амбессу стеной, вы где??? аниматик бомба, мне кажется, это ульта фортишей, это великолепно blah blah blah я щас умру от восхищения
Carajo
Woow
1:23 the stomach breathing movement just to draw attention to the sick packs XD
One of, if not my favorite music videos of all time.  Hits so hard for me.
Am I the only one that is interested in the series and not in the game itself? 😅
Isn't that the wolf that helps people to the after life and resurects the people who are going to do something?
So ambessa is a solari now?!? 🤷‍♂️
Ambessa was ready to just go all in on being the Wolf's chosen until she felt Mel.
One of my favorites, i've seen this almost 10 times and it still brings tears to my eyes.
Who is the guy in the middle at 2:33 ? I can see swain and kat, but im confused about the middle one
Woke shiet
On repeat !
I wonder if this what seraphine hears when in contact with amidala
3:31 Katarina is literally like Orin from bg3
Riot, consider my flabbers gashted. You truly have the transmedia vision that’s going to lead the way into the future of this industry.
Best clip/song done by Riot, which didn't got enough recognition imo.
Kindred
Reminder to everyone watching, no matter how much media pushes it: Black women will never be attractive besides very few cases. also they will never be significat people that change history.
This Music is underrated asf
La ceuta
죽음에서 돌아올 수 있는 자격을 갖춰라
How did they make the songs for season 2 even better than in 1
Amazing performance by the LEGENDARY Sheryl Lee Ralph 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 I couldn’t imagine anyone better to deliver a powerful vocal performance to convey the story of the cinematic so perfectly.
Oh it's already 10M
3:07 is no one see the trans flag in her face things
what kind of irl drum is being used at 1:40? I love that sound
2:48 anyone else find it incredibly satisfying how every strike of the mallet or whatever hits exactly on the beat?  and how the order they hit is completely random?
I loved that music before watching the season 2 and I was very surprised to not see it included. I'm glad I found the music video because some comments didn't make sense in the series and this music video doesn't make sense without the series. When I reached episode 7 I kept wondering how everything would be wrapped up in 2 episodes and the answer was not the best unfortunately..
I love the character even more knowing that she was pregnant with mel in this cinematic.
Is that woman young Ambessa?
Why the f in thinking that its ambessas singing haha
1:23 oh those abs are OILED UP
This sounds like a disney villain's "I want" song 😂😂
She was reborn again in war and through wolves. She refused to lie down dying on the battlefield without fighting. She clawed her way back up and embodied the warrior spirit and in her strength in unwillingness to die she saw the wolf. She rejected death and was granted life.
How does Riot create such charismatic black characters. They didn't miss once.
Im see the Kindred! 2:48
but I love how at the end I am sure when she died in Arcane she met the Lamb not the wolf because she died peacefully
Please lol, keep this level of music. This lady who sung this song is literally perfect. Bring back the dept and emotions in songs!!! I love this too much!
Riot has been killing it w/ Arcane series, been killing it w/ the game, keep em coming please
why not hire the same graphic designers as Arcane? It's not the same!
"You are the wolf"
3:38 this hits hard
4:01 bıtıs sahnesı yenı gelen noxus traılerınde kı ılk sahne wow
riot does not disappoint with their videos-unreal.
The quality that they put into their music for their video games is simply amazing.
"The wolf is coming"
So Mel saved her even as a fetus lol
Btw the beach where Mel arrives is the same beach where was Ambessa in her music clip
I love that even the toughest characters upgraded for Arcane are so parental and familial.... Especially in characters like Ambessa and Silco, it just touches my heart.
This should of been the op of season 2
What i am curious about, who are these people behind Pantheon? Doesn't look like leona or diana or taric or Soraka. Its seems like Katarina and Garen like body.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Not one person on this planet could have done her character more justice than this actress
I bet Mordekaiser's going full Karen. Complaining to the cosmic manager why he didn't end up here.
"what fixed your depression?" "Ambessa"
Saquen un nuevo juego modo 1 vs 1 algo que atraiga a nuevos usuarios y que extienda el universo de Arcane, que ha sido su mejor trabajo hasta ahora
Главное не показывать концовку классифицированным медикам :D В остальном, моё почтение. Так, как Riot работают над своим детищем, не работают даже примерно настолько же финансово успешные студии. Просто респект и уважение!
I just noticed the scorch marks around Ambessa as she stands up on the beach at the end.
Anyone see sevika in 1:57 ? Or is it just me
3:40 A wolf indeed, has mercy. Contrary to her signature line.
MRS. HOWARD? EXCUSE ME?
Here after the Mel parallel in the 2025 cinematic
I'll be honest ambessa being chosen as the wolf feels so much better then Mel's, I don't know how to put but ambessas feels so much more earn especially when she's doing this with no powers. We see how much she's fighting to win which makes you want her to win while mel is just using her powers with no issues. It just doesn't feel anywhere near as satisfying as watching ambessa get the title of the wolf. Her character was so well done and they just got rid of her. It's honestly disappointing. Mel is great but her getting the wolf title just doesn't feel as satisfying. That's the best I can explain it I don't know there's just something about this one that makes me more interested in ambessa compared to the fight we saw with mel, which was just no where near comparable
bro i just noticed at the end of this video it shows the beach ambessa is on and in the new noxus trailer mel lands on the same beach (this has lore implactions bc that means this isnt on a beach juring the ionian invasion,also if u want to know the name of the beach its Rokrund its beside piltover)
Ohirrivel
meus parabéns! uma animação digna da abertura de season, partindo de uma empresa deste porte,
I just noticed how the wolf showed her the image of a child she is carrying and that's what ultimately gave her the strength to pull out the arrow.
This song deserves more love. It goes so hard!
des frissons à caque écoutes
I kept waiting to see this in Arcane S02 but it never shoqed. Wtf? Did i miss something??
Why does this has such low views compared to the other videos
Was this song not actually in the show? I’ve watched the second season twice now and don’t remember it being in the show.
ARCANE SEASON 2 SPOILERS!!!    I keep seeing people talk about the lamb that Ambessa is carrying & it symbolizing innocenece. I believe that it does resemble innocence since it is a lamb, but is the child that is depicted holding it not Mel's brother Kino? Would the lamb not symbolize Ambessa's sacrifice of one child for another? The lamb is ripped apart in a sort of ritual, so I took it as a ritual to sacrifice the lamb, i.e. Kino.
Rah la yomkin
I need 3 seasons of Ambessa
JEBO VAM BOG MATER I VAMA SVIMA I VASOJ IGRICI GOVNA NESPOSOBNA
It does sadden me that after all this build-up they end her in such an underwhelming way in arcane.  I believe we're not completely done with her tho. With how little we know about Mell's powers... And Ambessa being the chosen of the wolf there's a decent chance she comes back.
3:37 Mel??
This is beautiful.
I think the characters is the members of the black rose and the lamb is the relic she stealed from em for Mel. What do you think about this guys ?  We see Pantheon Kata and swain in the golden Armor, Pantheon have deal with the death like ambessa for gain power.  I don't understand the part when Kindred give her the wolf item, do you think kindred have requested ambessa to steal the relic from the black rose ? I want your feedback and your therory about all of this.  Riot i love what you do, Arcane is a real banger all the things, the theory, the scenario, the songs, the possibilities, and the emotions you gave, this is incredible ! <3  I want to watch what's the next.
Where are these scenes from? They werent in the series
С большой буквы Женщина Воительница!❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I absolutely love this video and the singer; they are incredible!
We speak of 'becoming that from this' instead of 'this becoming that' more in the case of what does not survive the change-'becoming musical from unmusical', not 'from man'-but there are exceptions, as we sometimes use the latter form of expression even of what survives; we speak of 'a statue coming to be from bronze', not of the 'bronze becoming a statue'. The change, however, from an opposite which does not survive is described indifferently in both ways, 'becoming that from this' or 'this becoming that'. We say both that 'the unmusical becomes musical', and that 'from unmusical he becomes musical'. And so both forms are used of the complex, 'becoming a musical man from an unmusical man', and unmusical man becoming a musical man'.
Of course they give black champions everything ✌️ :)
I agree, absolutely everything here is magnificent. But personally, I can't take my eyes off the differents characters that appear in the background for a few split seconds. They each exude a particular and singular aura. They have a desgin that is at once so strange and so captivating and such a cool way of moving in the space around them. Crazy.  Congrats again Fortiche, vous faites honneur à la France
Ambesss ambassadors
2:18 is the moment she sacrifices Kino for the power to protect Mel, symbolized by the 'sacrificial lamb'. It's the deal she makes with the Wolf in Sheep's clothing.  Catch the moment you see it crouching like a lamb in the shadows before standing up.  As the sacrificial lamb is torn apart the it powers up that strangely carved stone the masked wolf drops into her hand. The sword as she sits on the stone throne shimmers like the same material.  In the show she tells Mel that she had to sacrifice one child for the other because she knew Mel would play a role in averting the end of the world.  Respect to Ambessa! The weight of the world did not bend her knees.  Mel saw it in the end. Just as she saw The Deceiver.
Ambessa is one of my favorite characters (having come from only watching Arcane) bc she is so brutal and complex. I adore how well written the show was
The Medarda obsession with "being the wolf" can show how they always fight death to the bitter end, while being the wolf (death) to all their foes. And her last words to Mel, "You are the wolf", could also play into this as "You are the Wolf". Meaning, Mel was Ambessa's Wolf (death) in the end.

Everyone’s talking about how great this is meanwhile I’m just crying over the goat it’s so cute 😭
Still upset we didn’t get the Kindred shown here
Further proving why Ambessa is the biggest badass in arcane
Whos this Dzaddyyyy yum 1:21
wait is this the young ambessa wth
“But the weight of the world won’t bend my knees”  Such a sick verse.
wtf... she was impregnated by wolves?
Love these music videos, zero interest in the game though.

Она - хорошая мать-воин. Riot Games your the best
This is so underrated??????????? 😭
Ambessa was probably my favourite character of Season 2 and I liked her in Season 1 already because they nailed her character. But in S2 she is just great; I just like the trope of someone fighting terrible odds as a normal, overcoming dangers she has no business meddling to begin with. If people like that achieve a true power like magic after they have struggled to become the best they could be, they become unstopable. Ruthless but not without purpose, as an easy excuse or because they are evil.
You're supposed to push the arrow _through,_ not pull it out!
the singer SLAYED THIS SONG I hope to see her more in the future thank you miss Sheryl Lee Ralph.
I’m a firm believer that what we’re seeing here is the Wolf’s Trial, but as a warrior from Noxus would see it. We know that the way Kindred appears is different for every culture, and often just for any individual in general. Here we see Ambessa facing death after battle, an arrow shot through her, and being offered a different path- a path to life, to all the things she could ever want, while giving up the chance for a quick and easy death, by releasing her lamb. Instead, she chose to fight the Chosen of the Wolf, the remnant figures who have fought Kindred and survived, given another chance- Atreus surviving his experience as the Aspect of War, Swayne surviving his own near-death experience, and the others are left up to question. She ultimately loses the fight, but she displays courage and resilience- traits she would need that honor her choice to survive. And in the end, she’s given her second chance, and revived, giving life to not only herself- but to her children, to Kino, and later Mel herself. Given that we know she later meets a man during her war march, it can be surmised that the man in question is also potentially either a Solari or an Aspect Host, given Mel’s powers.  Ambessa chose to become a conqueror then, to give up a peaceful life in order to give her family everything. Unfortunately, her conquest only cost her everything- her son, her relationship with her daughter, all of her alliances, thousands of her men, and eventually her own life. But in so doing, she set up Mel to take her place, to become the Wolf- the very being who gave her the chance to become something more.
Just occurred to me that the lamb that she sacrifices in the desert is Kino
badass swain standing there is enough
Mrs. Johnson went crazy in this one.
Is this on Spotify?
Riot visuals are on another leven now. They out of control. lmao
คือนางเห็น เมล ใช่ไหมตอนใกล้ตาย
почему вы не показали нам это в сериале?!?!?!
No crooked
Why is she black
I was raised by wolves I was born to lead And I starve 'til there's no more mouths to feed There's a hand on my throat And a blade at my feet But the weight of the world won't bend my knees Broken bones, battle scars I have seen the bloodshed Carved in stone, when it's my sword They won't forget No war, no peace 'til I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know I can use who I want And I taste what I please In this world, I get all my fantasies There's a hand on my throat And a child at my feet But the weight of the world Won't bend my knees No war, no peace 'til I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know Don't wash away my blood Don't wash away my sweat It's all I know Don't wash away my tears (Don't wash away, don't wash away) Don't wash my spirit, don't cleanse my soul Can't break my courage, and I won't fall 'Cause that's all I know No war, no peace 'til I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know
Finding out that she’s pregnant makes this even more badass
Love this Song , and the Animation and the story it tells !!!
how did i not watch this part
Для тех у кого автоматический переводится такси песни:   I was raised by wolves I was born to lead And I starve 'til there's no more mouths to feed There's a hand on my throat And a blade at my feet But the weight of the world won't bend my knees Broken bones, battle scars I have seen the bloodshed Carved in stone, when it's my sword They won't forget No war, no peace 'til I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know I can use who I want And I taste what I please In this world, I get all my fantasies There's a hand on my throat And a child at my feet But the weight of the world Won't bend my knees No war, no peace 'til I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know Don't wash away my blood Don't wash away my sweat It's all I know Don't wash away my tears (Don't wash away, don't wash away) Don't wash my spirit, don't cleanse my soul Can't break my courage, and I won't fall 'Cause that's all I know No war, no peace 'til I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know
Seeing ambessa music video and see what she had to go through to protect the family and how big of a threat black rose is.. I have my sympathy on why she thought arcane was the only choice
Leak to the next show
its a shame that i hate MOBAs with a passion because the lore and the characters are amazing... thankfully they made arcane and hoping for the mmo to be super good... 10/10 arcane
I was raised by wolves I was born to lead And I starve 'til there's no more mouths to feed There's a hand on my throat And a blade at my feet But the weight of the world won't bend my knees Broken bones, battle scars I have seen the bloodshed Carved in stone, when it's my sword They won't forget No war, no peace 'til I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know I can use who I want And I taste what I please In this world, I get all my fantasies There's a hand on my throat And a child at my feet But the weight of the world Won't bend my knees No war, no peace 'til I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know Don't wash away my blood Don't wash away my sweat It's all I know Don't wash away my tears (Don't wash away, don't wash away) Don't wash my spirit, don't cleanse my soul Can't break my courage, and I won't fall 'Cause that's all I know No war, no peace 'til I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know
[spoliers warning for those not finished with season 2]  Seeing how Riot promoted her, as well as how she got accepted by both aspects of death & war, I didn't really expect her death even with all the foreshadowing.
Inspired by BTS
Man what a voice, such a perfect fit as well
it shows the wokies how to represent tough attractive women.
My main question is why Ambessa is even going into battle when she is that far along in her pregnancy? Let alone being less armored than the others.
Noxus is SO inclusive, they even make pregnant women do naval invasions.
Essa cena não está em Arcane  Seria uma cena feita pra nova série de Noxus?
That vocals go crazy
Who disliked this song? Like nani?
I don't know the criteria but I really hope this goes up for Grammy consideration.
For a music company, riot do make some decent games
When you know Kindred's lore this hits so different
In TFT game, Mel has the ability to save you from dieing after she cast 12 times her ability. She probably save young Ambessa here with her ability.
So this is where it all started? Ambessa's anger
Там же свейн в конце ?
Okay, pro tip: do not pull out the arrow from your belly, snap it in half
Best character apart from jinx.
I love her do much.
"Where are all the strong female leads?! - "Ambessa existing"
This could honestly be used in the opening credits of the Noxus based series.
I fell for the trap...
3:07 ambessa es argentina. dorada campeona del mundo
Wow
If anyone says that this or arcane is not the best animated thing to exist I’m going to riot.
She got Abs in her voice ❤
third rewatch and now realizing Mel protected her from the womb
Was this in Arcane? Did i miss an episode?
Is it me, or Ambessa has something to do with a kinda Xerath cult?
Much love 7lite. Unity and respect 🙏 🫡 🙌 💯 👌
“You are the wolf” - Ambessa’s final words to Mel. I can’t stop thinking that the Kindred Wolf is actually what conceived Mel in some form - or is at least the reason that Mel has her power, like maybe she was pregnant and then traded her son’s life for her daughter’s life to be imbued with magic, to save them both
Ambessa was forced in war to protect her kingdom
I don’t know what part of her soul she used for this song but omfg I need more from her
i didnt like ambessa until i saw this
Am i the only one who gets 2 doffrent chills? One for the fantastic kind of music video wich could easily be a movie with all this lore. And one those creepy long legged dudes that drum on..what. sticks..?
This is my wife😍😫
Is Me's dad Pantheon???
Swain and Katarina in the background belike: yeah you are one of the cool kids now
The bass is chilling
Sheryl Lee Ralph killed it
Ohhhh my... 😍🥵🥵
They gotta make an RPG game fr..
그래서 검장단이랑 무슨 일이 있었던 거냐고 말하고 가라고
I think she is pregnant with Mel, and the lamb represents Kino. She was gonna survive since she passed Kindreds trial, but she had to sacrifice kino to save Mel. Of course it wasn’t until years later he died, but I feel like this is what truly sealed his fate. Ambessa knew deep down Kino was simply living on borrowed time.
what film/serial is it?
I wasn't expecting riot to show me a woman as badass as guts from berserk. And dang i love it
“Do not let unwholesome [foul, profane, worthless, vulgar] words ever come out of your mouth, but only such speech as is good for building up others, according to the need and the occasion, so that it will be a blessing to those who hear [you speak].” Ephesians 4:29 AMP- like using 'h*ll' as an expression or wishing for others to go there, instead, let's pray that may God save them and be with Him in Heaven when our Lord Jesus Christ comes again to take us!  God bless, Jesus loves you all, Amen
I have waited for Katarina for a long time with scene where she was standing on the right side.
1:39 This tall guy.. i'm crazy about them just by rewatching this clip over and over
Idc about league but now we need to see a full version of Ambessa's backstory
For those that have seen Hadestown, I would cast her as Hermes for a theatrical release in a heartbeat
Ambessa, the woman you are😩
3:38 subtle foreshadowing of mel's power
VIKTOR
Я была под таким впечатлением, что буквально не могла оторваться от экрана эти 4 минуты 19 секунд, все мое сознание погрузилось в этот клип
so epic
Who’s the strong guy of white hair that she’s fighting fighting with?
Why this song wasn't part of the show? I don't remember it in season 2 🤔
if someone stabbed you, you should never pull out the object until help comes tho...will save your life
sheryl lee ralph's ted talk is what made her perfect for singing this song, apart from her wonderful, bold, and strong voice
The fact that they teased us Mel is a mage
Ambessa the wolf of Noxus💪💪
masterpiece
This is my 15 time watching this, its so good
At the end Is the spoiler about mel's power; maybe she saved ambessa
Weird demon fellows looked like they're from Peter Mohrbacher's Angelarium series.
After watching Act 3 of Arcane, I think more and more that Ambessa is going to be the next Pantheon.  First of all, they introduce a new champ to the game only to canonically kill them off a month later? Idk. Seems odd.  Secondly, the Kindred imagery here is STRONG. Kindred is death incarnate, and here we see Ambessa accepting some kind of gift from them. Considering Ambessa died in the final act, and the imagery presented here, with her rising from death... combine that with the fact we see the last Pantheon (Atreus) in this video fighting Ambessa, which may very well be the Aspect testing her to see if she is worthy.  This gift from Kindred could be the renewal of life, a rebirthing. No longer Ambessa, but instead becoming the new Aspect of War itself. We see how she transforms and has her new outfit as soon as she accepts the gift from Kindred, fully stepping into her new role as Aspect, with golden armor and symbols which are very similar to Pantheon's. Ambessa had never used golden before then.  Through countless battles and struggles, her scars become golden, showing how she proves herself in the eyes of the Aspect, who ends up choosing her to become its new vessel on earth and grants her new life.

Ambessa the woman you are and were,,,,,,,,,
God I love Ambessa so much!!!
Riot: " we also make games and movies sometimes"
i like tht young ambessa looks so much like mel
......something is different.... (In a "I guess I'm in love and it worries me" tone)
I dont care. I love you Ambessa
All these have to do with the Mordekeiser story. There can be only one ruler of death. Also, this video hints a new game mode.
Most boring characters in the show and now there in the game. Lame
Dad lore: so I met a pretty girl in high school...  Mom lore:
I need abessa content now
As someone who doesnt play league can someone explain this video?  Is this Ambessa pregnant with mel during a war?  Who is the guy she was fighting?  Is her son supposed to be the lamb that she sacrifices to the wolf for more power?
Ambesa is God
i watched the entire arcane series and I didn't watch this???? chapter??
Ambessa NEEDS her own series and there's NO WAY around it
Ambessa: building nothing but sheer Tenacity!
Mrs Howard gonna be dominating my work out pkaylist i see
Riot made her with all the love they had.
Para cuando la serie de ambessa
Ambessa fights the pantheon?
They can never make me hate her shes literally one of the best with the best backstory
Xin tên nhạc
x3
Ahora necesito una serie sobre Ambessa ❤
não entendi nada mais achei foda
Ambessa is the sacrificial lamb so Mel can become the wolf Ambessa needs. There is also duality is Ambessa sacrificing herself to the "pack". It makes the sing scream part of the song more of a cry of grief for the innocence Ambessa knows she's has to shed and leave behind. It feels like Ambessa knew she was gonna die this whole time, and maybe that's why she was never afraid of any choice she knew she HAD to make.  idk... just a thought from a film nerd who's never played League.
Que voz, Forte, de presença . ate arrepia
Man i cant stop listening to this haha her voice is so powerful it makes you feel like you can clutch a 1v5  with half health
Aunty Sheryl making us proud once again!!
This is insane! 11/10 top 3 tracks in Arcane!!
2:33 Swain, Pantheon, Katarina.
MISS HOWARD ???? FROM ABBOT ELEMENTARY??????
Ambesa's spin-off prelude? Amazing.
They love making these characters so god dam fine
These lyrics are so amazing! Love some of the one liners "and Ill starve 'til theres no more mouths to feed." "Leave me with my demons, 'til my voice calls."
i love this masterpiece
My question is, Does this video mean her becoming a chosen of the wolf is canon to her storyline since they're showing Mel as a baby at the end as well?
If the next series after arcane would be about noxus.... Guys - Sabaton! Please! XD
Who’s that tall hot white haired man she was fighting? 👀
The symbolism! This is how Mel was made! Ambesa practicality made a deal with a god to make sure Mel would survive!
ngl i love this song so much, it feels powerful and very catchy
let's go ambessa
I’ve never played legue of legends, I’ve only watched arcane, but GOD. This is soooo good! I bet that there’s a lot of lore that only league players would understand, but something I just noticed it that ambessa’s mask looks a lot like victors does in the last episode of arcane season 2, like right here 3:24 Maybe that’s just a coincidence.
I just watched the voice actor for this recording tje song for this so I said let me check it out.
She is third best after Jinx amd Ekko from my TOP FAVORITE characters
last one was soo much better
DAAAAAYUMN
Not really feeling the anime style pop sound here. I feel like it would have been better served with either a rock, hip hop or soul ballad style.
Barbara from Abbot brought me here.
Hear me out, I think the lamb symbolizes her son who was shown in her nightmare as a statue of a small boy holding a lamb. Her son, "All the sweetness in my heart." It also explains the obvious dispair in her bodylanguage throughout most of the video and referrences to leaving her with her demons.   Ambessa was raised as a warlord, destined to compete with other warlords for power.  In particular, Swain the Noxian General. She goes against him over and over without success - so she seeks out the power to make her stronger - the arcane. This turns out to be a massive mistake.   The mages will not allow themselves to be conscripted so she seduces one to literally create a weapon - Mel. When mages realize what she has done she allows them to trap and kill her son hoping they will be thrown off Mel's scent. The imagery showing the lamb being destroyed and forming into a magical artifact. "I hope you never have to experience the agony of sacrificing one child to save another" and "I discovered a fourth principle....sacrifice."
Voice is Barbara from abbot elementary 🔥🔥
Ambessa aka AmbessAAAAAAAAH
I wonder who Mel's father is
It looks uper duper cool on an AMV but dont pull out of your wound an arrow you´ll bleed out faster folks
Kindred delivers in any religion
It's currently 41°C in Perth, Aus. Watched this to cool down cos it gave me shivers.
Ambessa try not to be hot challenge (impossible)
Why all the satanic symbolism???
Very Nice, Bravo, and thanks for the res

-10:19 nice
That's an incredible video, an incredible song, a great add on to an incredible show. Thank uou Riot and Fortiche. Best show I've seen in 2024. I'm here for more
Sounds like a League of Legends anthem 🔥🔥🔥
Riot should focus on making tvshows and movies. This is fire
after everything she done, after every sacrifices I can't hate her no matter what, all I feel is respect and admiration.
Incredibly fantastic song.  So underrated too, only 7.8m views??
This champ .. charismatique af
1:24 Gilded Spearmen: "Square up."
Dang this video hits hard after finishing act three…
I loooooovve that we got Ambessa lore!!
I cannot unsee it now, but she could absolutely be a warmonger like Apollyon in For Honor.
yo wtf ???
Ambessa's commitment to the warrior identity literally dragging Mel into danger before she was even born illustrates their dynamic more succinctly than any line of expository dialogue could have.
Kino was the lamb who has to be sacrified, thats why Ambessa is like this and Mel is the wolf
0:47 say that again?
If I was not a robot I would have goosebumps!
I was raised by wolves I was born to lead And I starve 'til there's no more mouths to feed There's a hand on my throat And a blade at my feet But the weight of the world won't bend my knees Broken bones, battle scars I have seen the bloodshed Carved in stone, when it's my sword They won't forget No war, no peace 'til I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know I can use who I want And I taste what I please In this world, I get all my fantasies There's a hand on my throat And a child at my feet But the weight of the world Won't bend my knees No war, no peace 'til I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know Don't wash away my blood Don't wash away my sweat It's all I know Don't wash away my tears (Don't wash away, don't wash away) Don't wash my spirit, don't cleanse my soul Can't break my courage, and I won't fall 'Cause that's all I know No war, no peace 'til I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know

I LOVE THIS AND I LOVE HER RAHHHHHH
Is it just me or the lamb's mask looks like a fox :3
DOES THIS MEAN MEL IS THE REASON SHE SURVIVED????
Мне нравится думать, что в какой то степени Мел является этим золотым ягненком....
BADASS
"You are the wolf."
Love this more and more! Song is great, visuals are great, and I love Ambessa! gg Riot!
Ambessa is the "Woman King" of Riot Games Music Animation🤩😎
i think the music is really good but video is quite confusing
they could never make me hate you ambessa
League is such a great game I got my best homies from league.and no matter how anyone told you to run away from league after u watch arcane or when u ask if u should try ignore them man. To judge if game good or not u should try it by your self.
Only arcane has shown so much glorification of women, I love it
Do you think if Riot made League like Overwatch or Marvel Rivals, would it have more players?
IS SHE PREGNANT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? i just caught that!
What ep guys??
SO ADDICTED TO THIS SONG AAAAA❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
가수분 목소리 힘 있고 카리스마 있네요
Anyone else reckon Pantheon is Mels dad
Hadn't thought of the lamb/ wolf imagery being kindred until a friend said something
Kindred is everything
Correct me if im wrong..1:58 is this panteon?
So did baby Mel yoinked Ambessa from runeterra's valhalla?
🤑🤑🤑
3:00 is that Lamb? If so, anyone notice how Kindred has started getting more and more attention even if its subtle?
Queste scene spero verranno inserite nella prossima serie legata a noxus, e credo che li sarà mell la protagonista così da approfondire per bene la sua storia e quella  della rosa nera.
Animations, songs and everythings is just perfect.....but then there is that game lol😂
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NOXUS STORY, I HOPE THEY SHOW AMBESSA, SHE'S A BADASSSS, I need to see her so bad 🤩🤩
Me parece increíble que para entender a ambessa solo debes escuchar su canción.
Ambessa origin spinoff show? Count me in!!!
이거 부른사람이 아침에 일어나서 양치하고 물뱉고 거울보고 예쁜년 그사람임
The MVP of S2. Thank you. ✊🏾
Comme quoi temps qu'on cherche pas à répondre à des critères à la con de marketing il est pas dur de faire une femme badass que les hommes adorent ...

Eles entregaram demais na série, eu não sei nada sobre jogos mas eu amei Arcane ❤
👍👍
Love this 🤘🏽🔥⚡🎶❤️‍🔥🫶🏽
Hunt with Ambessa and the champions as the Wolf's Chosen on November 6, 2025? Next year?
Ambessa is straight up Darth Vader in terms of presence

WHY THE SONG SO SHORT ... 😭
Lyrics:  I was raised by wolves I was born to lead And I starve 'til there's no more mouths to feed There's a hand on my throat And a blade at my feet But the weight of the world won't bend my knees Broken bones, battle scars I have seen the bloodshed Carved in stone, when it's my sword They won't forget No war, no peace 'til I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know I can use who I want And I taste what I please In this world, I get all my fantasies There's a hand on my throat And a child at my feet But the weight of the world Won't bend my knees No war, no peace 'til I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know Don't wash away my blood Don't wash away my sweat It's all I know Don't wash away my tears (Don't wash away, don't wash away) Don't wash my spirit, don't cleanse my soul Can't break my courage, and I won't fall 'Cause that's all I know No war, no peace 'til I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know

She had to go, but I'm sad she's gone.
What episode is ths song in ? If anyone knows.
“A wolf has no mercy”
This was amazing. And that growl at 3:05?😩 Such a dope song for an incredible character.
This song would fit as a League World's main theme.
Rise and rise again. Until Lambs become Lions
Wait, Noxians put women in visible pregnancy into army as active soldier taking part in battles and other military operations ? Sure, why not
a whole beast
I love the stroy telling of this M/V.  It shows that no one is born strong af out of the womb. Ambessa became what she is now because of all the hardships she went through and triumph on, hence the battle scars appearing as the mv progress.  She sacrificed a lot, including her son’s own life. She might not be the kindest and most morally correct in Arcane but we can learn a lot from her.   Oh, Ambessa they can never make me hate you. 🐺💪🏽
Wait, this song and mv doesn't really appears in any of the episodes right? I don't recognize it but I have such bad memory
Where's the animations in the video from?
no habia notado el spoyler de Mel en forma de feto con poderes al final
Ambessa pulled up like kratos, no one can convince me those gauntlet blade things aren't like the blades of chaos
Is that pantheon?
2 YEARS FOR A CINEMATIC ( vous êtes fortiche )
1:38 🥁🔥
In the series we hear that "A wolf has no mercy". Isin't this vid contradicting, or ambessa was playing dead to save her life ?
everytime i mean EVERYTIME  League do a OMV of a champion  goosebumps always feeds my nerve !!! well done!
Crazy that Christian Linke is the executive Producer for this song, that guy seems to be some kind of creative genius if he does good Music and something as incredible as Arcane. Tho to be honest i dont really know what an executive Producer does...
I just noticed that ambessa was ALREADY 'shot' by 'lamb' symbolically with that arrow in her stomach oh my god
Do you believe a single Song can turn your most hated character in the arcane series into one of your favorite characters in the series ? Then believe me and listen to this Masterpiece ! ❤️
someone needs to start the petition for them to have Sheryl Lee Ralph perform this as the opener for next years worlds!
Really highlights the sheer potential the LoL universe has for narrative content
This makes Ambessa and Mel's story so much more depressing.
3:09 i feel like im ascending to god hood with this part holy hevk those vocals are 🔥🔥🔥
_ICT🌆9PM Dec 3rd 2024_
I’m glad there isn’t anti woke nonsense in the LoL community  The storytelling is amazing
i love this song, but....;-;;;;
Local cuisine is dead 😭😭😭
this is legendary !
The incredible work and dedication behind that one single video.... is simply breathtaking... a single thank you from one of your viewers to all the team behind this amazing work of art, to my eyes, thank you for this is an astounding delivery. The heart and soul of every man and woman of your team has been in it by a 10000% in this, I really hope with all my heart that you get the budget to do others like this. Thank you...
How to tell a character’s backround story within 4 minutes and music
I didnt love Ambessa in Arcane tbh. I get she is like a conflicting character. But this video had me rooting for her. 😂
You're my favourite war lord, Ambessa
Riot can’t make me play league I mean it looks convincing but no I must resist
I like this. Thank you
2:49  Those tall drummer’s go hard 😂
ambessa hazme lo que quieras, pisame golpeame lo que quieras  te amo 😭
Wow, Sheryl's voice sounds so good in this music
Ambessa looks so good back then I love it 💪❤️‍🔥🥰
Whats the First Song  Name ?
need an acoustic unplugged version of this
Too much emo cringe vibes for my taste
Fun Fact: The singer in this, Sheryl Lee Ralph, is an award winning actress and Broadway singer. She might be most known to the internet for being the older teacher in Abbot Elementary, Barbara Howard.
So good ! Thank you ARCANE :)
Why are noxians so obsessed with wolves and ravens
Powerful
we need more like this, we need moree!!!!!
Remember, it took Piltover and Zaun to defeat her.
Was Ambessa a terrible person? Sure. But I have to respect the grind and the hands she delivered.
Watching this after Arcane S2 is a trip.
Nooo Ambessa you're not supposed to pull it out:(
Peut être un aperçu de la suite. Dû coup pas après la fin de la saison 2 mais peut être bien avant les évènements dans un autre continent.
Ambessa is not the wolf , Mel Medarda is the chosen wolf
So Le blanc was hinting that Mel was a love child of Ambessa and some unknown character. With Pantheon being the sparing partner in this music video do we think Pantheon is possibly Mel's father or am I over thinking this?
Wonder if that desert realm with all of the people running around and stuff is the Noxian afterlife. Just a constant battle with monolithic war drummers
When you get shot with an arrow and live, do not pull it out until you find medical attention, brace it and pressure around it
Arcane spoilers     'Sacrifical Lamb' is a phrase that exists, and in Arcane we know Ambessa believes herself to have found a fourth principle for Noxus, that of Sacrifice  We see her holding the lamb, ranning through a battle feild getting bumped around while gripping onto it. Looking around with it still in her arms unable to see a way out. Her rasing the lamb up as if in offering with a look of anguish on her face. The lamb starting to break apart. A statue of a child holding the lamb, then reflrcted in her eye as a tear escapes. The lamb fulling breaking, it's particals disapering into crystal. Then her screaming out (the scene matches the one where she had the lamb even if it's no longer there) before standing as a warrior (does flash into same scene where lamb once was again)  As to what it is she may be sacrificing, it could be what's left of her innocence or childhood, the last of any kindness or mercy she may have possesed, or something like that  However with the scene of that statue, I wonder if it's a refernce to a sacrifice that'll be made later on in life 'I pray you never know the agony of having to forsake one child to save another' it would still fit with the other possible answers even 'he was all the sweetness in my heart'. At the end we even see the infant that is probally Mel with golden effect growing inside of her. Assuming Kino was older that may have been the moment the possibility of her having to choose between children came into being
God I LOVE Sheryl Lee Ralph and she would’ve made an amazing Ambessa. Would have been so cool to see her in a more violent, cold role as opposed to the warm character that is Barbara in Abbott Elementary!!
Why was this not in the show??😭😭
Fortiche is the best
1:23 why he kinda….
Nobody : ...  Fortiche : Nah, i'd cook.
and no not all right. and not no one.
At 2:20, it feels like I’m looking at my younger self, with tears, who endured physical and emotional abuse in the family for years. For that version of me, I’m still fighting.
I think the child Mel, is what actually brought ambessa back to life. The same time the baby opens up her eyes is the same time ambessa woke up too.
This video is giving me hope that I will see ambessa in the upcoming season. We might see young ambessa.
Let me outta this stupid and fake country. Nothing but a bunch of fake white snakes.
Honestly, they should add this to the songlist for MSI/Worlds 2025. This is such a great song for it and you could put an amazing performance on stage with this song!
What a powerful voice  🤤
this is just the surface of Ambessa's origin right? she's so young here
Now I'm intrigued who's Mel's father was it that mage that gaves Ambessa the gems who looks like a king but then was also killed by Ambessa in the end to take the throne?- in Arcane it was said that she feel in love if that was true then I feel pain for Ambessa for killing her loved ones for Power and the name of Medarda
I was raised by wolves I was born to lead And I starve ’til there’s no more mouths to feed There’s a hand on my throat And a blade at my feet But the weight of the world won’t bend my knees  Broken bones, battle scars I have seen the bloodshed Carved in stone, when it’s my sword They won’t forget  No war, no peace ’Till I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat and tears Is all I know I can use who I want And I taste what I please In this world I get all my fantasies There’s a hand on my throat And a child at my feet But the weight of the world won’t bend my knees No war, no peace ’Till I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat and tears Is all I know [Don’t wash away my Blood, don’t wash away my Sweat, don’t wash away my Tears] Don’t wash my spirit, don’t cleanse my soul Can’t break my courage, and I won’t fall ’Cause that’s all I know No war, no peace ’Till I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat and tears Is all I know
2:40 here comes my favourite part. So badass and dark, with the lamb torn apart, symbolizing her innocence's death. And the voice is so powerful! An amazing song for an amazing character.
WOMAN KING REFERENCE
shes such a powerful singer i got chills, especially in the final part. she embodies ambessas' character so well its insane
Fantastic 👏
Guess what happened when you set up a system to punish people for doing the right thing.
Now they have nothing to say to me. I did do the right thing in the beginning until they fked up.
What an amazing music, singer and visuals
Is she really dead?
I haven't watched Arcane 2 yet but wow this song hits. I'm a sucker for songs with intricate stories behind them
"You are the wolf..."
Fear an old woman in a profession where young men die at caitlyn age she was going through d day no wonder it also took a mage to kill her
Funny to see how ambassa said mel weakens her but here she literly gave her the power to rise up from her deathbad love arcane🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Do you think that lamb represents her son? If i remember correctly she had to give up her son for the sake of her daughter. Which would also explain her anguish when she’s in the place she gave up the lamb.
After watching the ending of Arcane, where Ambessa tells Mel that she’s the wolf or something like that, I’ve got this theory: Ambessa only survived because Mel was in her womb, and the "power" Mel has was inherited from that moment.
3:20-3:33 is one of the hardest animation sequences I have ever seen. I can't stop rewatching it
aguante ambessaaaa
Kindred
I thought  Sheryl Lee Ralph was Ambessa's voice actress too, this sounds exactly like her
OMG Mel saved her 😱🥲
go woke go broke.
Не мой вкус, вообще не зашёл
TWISTED FATE ♠️ ♥️ ♣️ ♦️ VFX UPDATE IN WILD RIFT???
3:44 by the way... if you ever find yourself impaled by a crossbow bolt. Don't pull it out, you will cause more bleeding, more damage, and might die.
I love this woman
goosebumps
Allat just to die a month after being introduced
I love this voice! Sheryl is a goddess!!❤
Wonder if Kindred actually saved Ambessa to save Mel. Cuz Mel's the chosen of the wolf
Riot needs to make MORE music!
영상은 기깔나게 만들고 판테 스킨은..ㅈ구데기...
I finally understand Ambessa's secret in the series, she took a strange power to have the power and thus become general of Noxus alongside those in golden armor that we see in the video, she saw all this in a vision while Mel was in her belly which makes Mel a special being.
I gotta say, after 100 ost listenings this song is really grown big
Wow, Mrs. Barbara. I was unaware of your game.
WTF did i just watch?!?!?!
resisting to play league every day...
Discovered this song on the Arcane S2 album on Spotify and was waiting to hear it in the show but im so disappointed 😭 Wouldve worked so well in the last episode. Whoever sings this has a beautiful voice with a sense of power and rage
"Bold Child"
Das ist scheiße
They created Ambessa only to kill her on Arcane bruh riot.. Hope she is still somehow alive ~_~
maybe its cause i forgot s1 but who tf are the black rose. I had no idea why they were on her nuts for all of s2
Good god what a character! The way they used these background vocals in the final episode sent me reeling
I just realised that baby might be clearly Mel, and her waking up in the womb with golden lgiht, and thus bringing Ambessa back with her magic might be the case.
I wish Azahriah would cover this.
Ah yes drugs
Well done, excellent arrangement. I had the honor to serve and fight  shoulder to shoulder with a petite in comparison with us female Navajo battle buddy of mine, she replaced me for a while taking the heaviest load a soldier can carry , she became a GUNNER and was key to make a critical secret mission to succeed which loke one of mine change the course of war...to end it...
Miss Sheryl Lee Ralph having one of the hardest vibed songs  of 2024 was not on my bingo list, she has always been a powerful vocalist but this song has me mean mugging while playing COD!!
Is the sheep supposed to be her innocence or her children? Or something entirely else?
That voice is rattling my spine! Even though she is obviously a cruel and brutal person, I can't help but respect the raw strength of Ambessa's connviction and spirit  Even though she manipulated her, Cait greatly benefitted from learning from her
Not putting this one in Arcane was wild
she dead right??
Which episode is this
I saw someone say that ambessa was what mauvika from genshin impact should have been, never agreed more, im so disappointed in hoyo but THIS is so fire omg
The fact that its Sheryl Lee Ralph  (Barbara from Abbot Elementary)  herself singing this while be the VA for Ambessa already
THE SAY SHE SINGS "UNDERNEATH THESE BONES" SOUNDS SO POWERFUL
would love to watch ambessa spin-off. she's such a badass
Now I see the 'white Ambessa' holding the scapegoat was actually Ambessa's humanity. She abandoned her humanity, and became a ruthless warrior. 2:58
She survived because of her own daughter’s power and died from her own daughter’s power too!
Best antagonist in arcane
no meaningless.
Why didn’t they play this one in the series???😢😢😢 or did I miss it?
Kindred looks like Viktor
pqp como eu amo a ambessa 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Riot hizo todo bien menos el juego
Hello sir. Is that Swain and Katarina????? 3:25
Who is Mel's father???
Agora após Arcane, podemos ver que a Mel protegeu a Ambessa da morte.
I really dont like this version of Kindred. The Lamb looking brutal instead of gentle defies the very point of Kindreds nature.
Ambessa lived her whole life thinking she was the proctector. She bet everything on it. She thought she is the wolf and Mel is the fox that is making her weak. But it turned all around to be the total opposite. Mel is the Wolf. Ambessa realized it the moment she blew her last breath.
Ok now that I'm seeing this, a lot of her dialogue and admission in arcane make sense now.   I love how LOL, lore puts everyone in the morally gray. I think out of a lot of IPs I've gotten into, the characters of the world feel the most human.   Villain’s horns grow dull when you see the heart behind them, and hero’s halos become dim when you see their evil within.
Everyone is praising Ekko who really was awesome in season 2 but Ambessa is the character who made season 2. Really really good character design, unique, smart and strong. Thanks to her everything was connected so good. For me best character in season 2 and second is ekko
question is, who is the father???
💀💀💀
As someone who has only watched Arcane and doesn't know much about LOL-- This already makes me 100% more interested in Ambessa's character
BRING HER BACK TO LIFE
I love
did she sacrifice her son to be a leader?
dont play the game
I heard that in LoL death is represented by a wolf and a lamb together. Ambessa's lamb got destroyed and she chose the wolf?
How have I not heard of anyone of these songs and bands and they are all epic
4:10 League of Legends cor de sangue, cor da rosa negra, cor do amor ❤ que sangra para salvar a quem ele ama.
yeah
“You are the wolf” - Ambessa.

😲💓
I'm a little disappointed in Ambessa, what was she trying to accomplish partnering up with Viktor.
So this level of animation is like Arcane, yet we did not see it in tv show. Can they use it for other stories by Fortiche?
이런 서사를 보니까 아케인에서 굉장히 비호감이었던 챔피언이 이제는 매력적으로 느껴지네요
Barbara Howard, what are you doing here?
Arcane S2 spoilers below.... . . . . . I loved how clear Cupcake was to Vi when staging the betrayal to Ambessa.   Cupcake was very clear and stern when telling Vi not to underestimate Ambessa.  Vi is naturally gifted and goes head last into many fights, winning with her natural talent and determination, but cupcake knew this is probably not enough for Ambessa because she is such an absolute beast.  Vi could only win a one on one with Ambessa with a trick of some form.
Listening to this in the gym got me feeling like ambessa 😂😂😂😂😂🔥
Arcane’s real winner: Ambessa
Video Game Awards worthy
Literally my favorite character in all of Arcane. She's so complex and I'm definitely buying the book.
I just noticed, Ambessa told Mel that a wolf has no mercy. Yet, the wolf here spares Ambessa.
2:22 is actually Kino imo and his sacrifice is being asked in exchange for the life of hers and Mel's. Kino was the lamb and Mel is the wolf.
Ambessa is the true Woman King of Arcane
Excellent titre musical. Bravo Sheryl Lee Ralph
KINDRED?!?!
amazing, i love this, my favorite character in arcane
such a great writen character. keep going this is pure art.
Ambessa MyMomDarda
Ambessa might not be the best morally correct character in Arcane but gods I love her. She is strong and persistent. While being a powerful warlord you can still see some moments of motherly love before she returns to her warrior origins. Beautifully written. One of my favorites
MEL ES HIJA DE PHANTEON ?!
Aaaaaaand shes dead
que bosta

why is swain and pantheon relevant to ambessa?
I know this is perfect for Ambessa, but this also encapsulates Legendary Godzilla to a Tee
Варвик все таки всех их ебнул)
How is no one talking about how this was sung by the old lady from abbott elementary 😭😭😭🤌🏽
Its so beautiful how ALL CARACHTERS dserve their own spin off ❤
Such a deep character did dirty at the end of Arcane season 2 due to a rushing narration, relegated to a mere husk in order to progress the (too) many plotpoints. Such a pity there was too much of a focusless approach. For the first time in my life I feel they misjudged the decision to have the series be only two season. More breathing room would have helped make everything more cohesive and approachable/relatable.
Ambessa kötü karakter olarak gözüküyor bir de Arcane'de
I like to believe ambessa is fighting for Mel as she fights the wolf to not take her life    And when she cries is because she didn’t give up and let the lamb take her soul
After watching arcane this is what I think it means , the lamb is a symbol for her first born and to get to where she wanted to go (symbolizes as the throne in the video) she has to sacrifice the child (symbolizes as making a deal with death, kindred in the video)
A lot of people saying Mel saved Ambessa but ya'll should take a second look at the video. It's equally feasible that because she fought tooth and nail in that realm, she gained some power/respect for her perseverance and since she was pregnant, that power/respect was passed along to Mel. In turn, Mel cultivated and grew with it, evolving it to the powers she currently has. (e.g. we don't see anyone else with Kindred's blessing with Mel's power)
Meanahile Braum: HooHoo have a snack little poro!
Ambessa refuse the power of wolf cause she has to sacrifice her babe, so Mel receives it and became the chosen by wolf
What song is when jayce and ekko travelling back in time?? In s2ep7
The kid is Kino??
So epic. The voice of the singer in this song almost perfectly matches Ambessa's voice actress in Arcane, but they are two different people: Sheryl Lee Ralph and Ellen Thomas.  I love these voices.
dope
This has become the video I think about to pump me up during a workout.
3:29 와... 늑대가 멜을 선택한거네 씹소름돋았다 암베사는 대신 권력욕심에 눈 멀었고  시즌2 7화에서 멜이랑 늑대랑 대화한거네 안고있던 양은 첫째아들이고 결국 지키지못해 죽었고
best riot animation video and song ever realeased to date. this one is so much under appreciated :C
This is Beatifull
Fortiche is creating Masterpieces one after another!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
Someone said when Ambessa wakes back up in the battlefield after the battle with the wolf, the ground she is laying on glows red and hot and looks like a meteor crash and is left black and singed beneath her and now I can’t unsee it. I now think Mel the baby in her belly at the time also fought the wolf and came out victorious Mel has some special power to fight death like Zonhya’s and is how Ambessa lived and Mel survived Jinx’s rocket.
minha esposa 😭
Hope this can be in game award its too beautiful
wow you can really see mel and ambessa's resemblance here
Риоты, зачем убивать Амбессу? Я хотел о ней узнать больше! Свейна не троньте!
Epic
Eu queria ter visto o Zed
Here after realising Ambessa wasn’t the villain and arcane made me hate her for the plot
Didn't care for Ambessa but this MV is reeeeaally good.
RIP Ambessa🥲
This version of Lamb is absolutely terrifying. Can't imagine what her other half looks like.
This is the coolest character in Arcane SS2 to me 👌
rip ambessa
is this the young Ambessa ?
This song is so powerful, love it
Which episode is this?
rewatching this after watching the last episodes of Arcane it makes sense now
SHERYL LEE RALPH!?
Hearing the choirs of her song in Arcane gave me goosebumps, hate her or love her her character is so well made
Is this song about the season 3?
You are the wolf said Ambessa.
*moans*
That wasn't at season 1.
rip bozo
After watching the Arcane, this clip has become even better
A champion got hyped just to be killed in Arcane
R.I.P
Viviste una buena vida Ambesa: solo fue un mes Dije buena no larga 🗿
Being honest after watching Arcane, I think the show could have SERIOUSLY benefitted from putting this music video at the start of the finale episode and adding an extra 4 mins onto the time... I gained so much understanding of Ambessa's backstory from this, and so many little hints and details in reference to everything that happened in the show... It's ALL relevant, you even see Swain in the background, who is about to become very relevant to the new story Riot Games is writing.. Please, Riot. If you see this, go and put this music video in the front of the Finale Episode.
So when Ambessa says "you are the wolf" to Mel or whatever. Is this what she was referring too. Did Mel save Ambessa whilst in the womb?
I like to imagine that when she said "you are the wolf" she didn't said it to mel but because she saw kindred directly into their eyes once more
after completing arcane this vid hits even harder, ambessa is such a good character
R.i.p Ambessa 2024-2024, duro menos que las que me tocan en ranked
simplesmente cinema
funny ha?
Alpha Mom... You never died for me. The ones who killed you are the same ones who made you.
Make a show about her please I'm begging
the amount of spoilers in this video 😬
Mel is the chosen of the wolf
She isn't the chosen of the wolf but she is representing the wolf so good
Kino holding the lamb were what she had to sacrifice for power. Kino’s life and Mel’s innocence (metaphoric life). She knew this and accepted this for more power, each time the stakes being raised. Losing one child wasn’t enough to make her stop, sacrificing Mel’s life for power didn’t stop her, she would give everything to win and wouldn’t stop until she was dead. Mel had to defeat her, and embrace the wolf to do it. Yet, I feel it was more of a lamb leading a maddened warrior to peace like Lamb Kindred.
Ok so I am confused, I watched all the second season of arcane and this wasn't in there. Why?
rip ambessa, rip
It was Mel all along in her belly, notice the little golden shine in the baby near the end of the clip 3:37. That's why the Kindred overlooked Ambessa, Mel had to be born or Mel was already protecting Ambessa before being born.
She having a Valhalla experience in league
Who's here after watching the last episode of arcan's second season
So ambessa was the lamb the the child in her belly (Mel) was the wolf.
u guys dint have the right!!!! come on riot she was the very best of characters
RIP Ambessa
She is the Wolf!!!
Spoilers     Kindred: “Oh hi again!”
Coming back to this after Act Three, the amount of foreshadowing is insane.
She gave up the sheep in order to gain the wolf. Seems she finally found it
good video, bad song
Why does she pull out the arrow along with the tip? She will bleed out and die faster that way?
I might be over theorizing here but at the end Ambessa seemed to be in Mordekaiser realm before returning back to life, from the vision, to carry Mel back home where she got more attached to the family crest.
Criminally underrated song and the animation is so complex in its lore and layering it's a masterpiece..... HOW IS IT ONLY at 5,000,000 views.... Come on people sort it out and GET WATCHING.
Romulus and Remus were suckled by a wolf. Mel is fathered by one
After Arcane this was hinting so much
Riot please make her come back!
늑대의 선택은 암베사가 아닌, 태중의 멜이 받은것이었군요
Rest in power Ambessa. The fourth pillar of sacrifice, did in turn, sacrifice itself for the Medarda line to live.
OK, HEAR ME OUT  After watching act 3 of arcane, my theory is that Mel's saving powers are actually what saved Ambessa here. At the end of the video you can see baby Mel in a womb presumably using her powers for the first time. Also her eyes glow in the same way as when she uses her powers in the show
Miss Sheryl's voice is perfect for this song and as Ambessa's inner-voice!
Why didn't play this song on Arcane? I don't remember hearing it or am I just deaf?
She can't be dead right? There's no other league champ that's legitimately dead... this video basically shows that she's kinda unable to die
todos te odian pero yo te amo lol
We'll never forget the Wolf !!
Rest in peace wolf lady, you were too awesome for that world
Mel Medarda is "The Wolf"
That baby inside of her was the wolf all along. Good foreshadowing Arcane!
WHY DID YOU KILL AMBESSA
im so sad
"You are the wolf."
1:06 I love that she so battle ready, she comes in with a few seconds of confusion, understands her situation and locks in immediately.
Some series franchises seem like they dont give effort on making kids look like their parents other than hair color or beauty marks, So its a nice change how you can see Mel basically looks identical to young Ambessa, even Vi and Jinx look like their mom.
KINDRED
YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH OF A VIBE THIS ISSSS
LEAGUE. NEVER. DISAPPOINTS❤😮
I am so shocked that Sheryl Lee Ralph sang for League of Legends. She is definitely a Force of Nature that cannot be stopped. I am awestruck at this song. All I can say is, “Well Done, Sheryl Lee Ralph!”🤩
SuuuuCKKKKer
Not Ambessa singing xD
I dont care who Riot sends, I still not gonna play league.
Cringefest
This song is so freaking good
This is awesome I wish LoL was a good game with a nice community so I could play it
как можно послушать и что ввести в поиск в яндекс песне
I need for this to be fully explained in Arcane at some point video and all
Is that pantheon
S
I wish Ambessa can be the strongest character in LoL
BARBARA?!?!
WERE MAKING IT OUTTA SILVER WITH THIS ONE BOYS.
mommy
Next Arcane in Noxus?
So question do their race or ethnicity bleed gold?
God I love strong women
Wait did she bang the god?
0:54 black rose?
I like that she looks like Mel in her teens
롤드컵 뮤비보다 잘만들었네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Wow
That has to be mel ambessa is carrying!😊
That'd be dope to get a series about Ambessa, Mel and their kingdom
Legit the way she says fantasies is crazy  close to ambessa what a character she’s been glorious this season so far
damn this is good
Sh probably cried in that child scene cause of her son
She was probably pregnant with Mel here
"What motivated you to get back into working out?" "Ambessa"
its sounds like its ambessa singing lol
Meh
1:39 I LOVE THIS SOOO MUCH!!!!!
This vooooicce omg this is so epic
I saw Kindred and got chills-
Ooooooo this is me.
Legit sounds like something Shirley Bassey would sing
3:39 this musical choir was simply absurd
achei uma bosta, melhorem, quando vai sair um clipe do vladimir?
PANTHEON LOOKS SO COOL
La fameuse bataille d'Étretat ⚔️
Not even looking at the vid and can tell this all Ambessa ❤
Best intro music video since Jinx.
first thing i have to say is we saw the same sort of rose pattern in the rocks at some point in the clip, wich we also kinda see in act 2 with mel. not the same one, but same pattern of a rose etc. wich is interresting.
this is the only song that hasnt been played in arcane yet. maybe we will get ut this weekend
Ambessa was pregnant or I'm crazy ?
It feels like im watching "On The silver globe" with all these costumes
Can someone tell what this is? Is this also in arcane or is it just a music video for lol?
I normally would never listen to a voice like this (i like smooth or electriconic voices), but this song just hits different. The roughness of the voice makes it feel like a thick coarse blanket for my ears, and I absolutely love it.
Wake Up Samurai!
Why is she carrying a lamb? Is this some sort of religious reference?
I think Mel’s power might’ve been what revived Ambessa.
As powerful as it is I'm still not liking Ambessa from Arcane
I love this so much
Not familiar with the game but what are the creatures she’s running with in the desert, the ones on the drums?
Not gonna lie at first I didn’t really like the song but now after hearing it a couple of more times I’ve grown to like it a lot.
Was she pregnant with Mel at this point?
vocês são troxas comandados pelo vicio. esse jogo ta entupido de scipt hack hydra e nem admitem por ser fanboy cegos. kkkk perde tempo de vida em um lugar onde a empresa caga pra voccês piada de nerd sem futuro
Incrível.... Show .... Espetácular
шедевр.
The "choir" part here 3:38 (you can hear it during the chorus too) seems like the choir in "I'm still here". If I'm right this is a very nice detail because, after all, Ambessa is still here for sure. ❤   P.S. Sorry if my English is a bit bad, I'm still learning.
Me and my baka life didn't realize she's actually pregnant when I turn up the brightness on this device here...
The baby represent "new life" and when the eyes open is the same as the wolf in the beggining. Its not about pregnancy, when the baby eyes open, immediately she wake up in real life.Its means a new life by a choosen of the wolf
Barbara got pipes!
SPOILER ALERT FOR ARCANE:    After Watching Arcane Episode 5 then watched this I suddenly noticed she was pregnant at the beginning, and at 4:04 which is the story related to Ambessa's travels ,and leading to the birth of Mel Medarda which is why the Black-Rose is hunting them.
What song is in the beck ground
fun fact her father's name is menelik who was the king of ethiopian empire who defeated the italian arm with just swords and shields
RAISED BY WOLFS!
I love the fact that riot created this character for arcane, ended up liking her so much, they put her in the game 😂❤ thats just awesome
we got new Valhala member, nice
After watching episodes 5 that baby has to be Mel. Juuuust saying
So this is Ambessa, I thought it was Mel. im so dumb.
GO OFFF MS BARBARA
Part of me wants to see Ambessa belt this out at some point in Arcane.
Para quem não sabe, o mano que está cantando é autista e deficiente visual, ele apareceu no American's G.Talent e canta lidamente! Curiosidade 😊
Wait does this mean that Ambessa is originally from Shurima? :o
Atreus is the baby daddy im calling it
Hang on, hang on, does video reveal that Mel is the daughter of Kindred!?
"...and I starve till there's no more mouth to feed"🔥👑🧎‍♀️🤌
Why is there only 5 million views? It's clearly one of their best song (and music video)
And fortiche strikes again
Lame
Ambessa at Etretat
The baby she was carrying seen at the last part of the video is mel omg😭
Since arcane season 2's episode 5, i wonder if the lamb Ambessa is holding and protecting is (or not) actually a representation of her baby Mel
Should be illegal to drop this much fire on us
is the baby Melora or her brother?
Muito gostosa tá
That fetus has to be Mel after watching acr II is season 2
Pantheon is Noxian?
I can’t not hear Barbra from Abbott elementary but oh my god she did amazing!!
DOMMY MOMMY is here...
THE FACT THAT THE VO FOR AMBESSA SINGS THIS!?
Very cool
I hope one day Riot makes a music video with Nothing But Thieves 🙏
For NOXUS
I noticed that the baby in Ambessa's womb glowed with gold when she woke back up, and if that was Mel, it would line up with all the gold energy we've seen around Mel. So, what if mel actually somehow protected Ambessa from the womb, kinda like in act ep 1 where it looks like she protected herself and Jayce. Then even further, according to some theories people believe that Mel is the one who was actually "chosen by the wolves", which would explain in a way how Mel somehow always survives life and death situations. Idk, after act 2, i'm in theory mode, sorry😅
this is art
This is by far my favorite song Riot has released this year
Did Ambessa sacrifice her son ?
Pantheon is father Mel???
is that panthion ?
When this came out 3 weeks ago I pointed at my screen going 'that cave wall looks like a rose' and after today's arcane episodes releasing i can confidently say COINCIDENCE? I THINK **NOT**
At 1:57 who is that!!! Is it Ambessa’s reflection because it looks like someone else and I just can’t tell who!!! Someone enhance and explain!!
I 100% support an Ambessa spinoff. This VO actor is killing it on so many levels.
okay but where can I get more stuff like THIS I can't stop looping
i love mrs. howard sooo much
It looks like a preview of the next League series after Arcane 😏
Im here after ep 5 she was pregnant of mel !!!the child of the prophecy !  She was trying to protect her
This video confirms something from arcane and i think its huge
No naafiri and warwick? Lmao you all created a wolf champions and not decided to use them for this?
sh got me in tears bro gaddamn' riot
Riot loves Ambessa Medarda
MRS HOWARD?!?!?
azir
The quality levels of this is mind blowing. The music, the editing, the lore nuggets, the artwork tied together so incredibly well. Hats off to everyone involved with this you created a true masterpiece of modern art.
They forgot to add a crucial part of her story where she meets Local cuisine
Mel has that gold thing on her back. Remember how she protected jayce i think she protected her mom too  Edit: i was right.
Sheryl Lee Ralph had no business goin THIS hard on this song! 🤩🔥 I can’t stop playing it at max volume. For those who aren’t aware, she’s an actress, broadway icon, R&B and sometimes Gospel singer and she laid it DOWN on this track! 😍
I thought Ambessa was a convictionless meathead living off past glories. How wrong I was.
Why does this keep getting better the more I listen to it??
I grow to like this song a lot.
i cant believe this is only less than 5 million views🙁🙁
Got some love, deaths robots vibe from this
is it me or riot hhate whiite people lool
Vid and song are incredible, but ... WHY... Why put that League Message Sound in at 0:25 xD always triggers me to open my client xD
Does anyone know if they made this specifically for the show, or is just a short music video to promote the game more?
So is it like a “House of Usher” thing where she’s given up her future kid to a god for power and now it’s time to pay up but she won’t lose Mel after they took the son??
this is my song 😭
Judging from Sez 2 of Arcane, it seems baby Mel saved Ambessa from death.
Great music video but I have to say, going to war while pregnant is so laughably dumb.
I think lamb is a sacrifice to get a gift and powers from the death. And her sacrifice was her son(her crying looking at the statue of a boy with a lamb). But at the end she got Mel, and she will not let anything happen to her.
Really love her voice, so good.
malo el video culiao
🔥
2:18 I think this is her son, who died in Arcane
No one here that is appreciating ambessa actually plays league
Terrible singing , Decent cinematic
Those creatures running around in the desert look like Bakai
Barbara wasn't kidding when she said she can SING, 😮  jokes aside Sheryl Lee Ralph killed this. 😍
Arcane is goated
Raise the Noxtoraa! Remember this day!
Was that Mel in her belly?
Vea braba 💪🏻
Больше чёрных, больше чёрных, больше черных
Is the fetus Mel or her brother?
ES LO MÁS PERFECTO QUÉ HE VISTO ESTE AÑO,  PRECIOSO ES DEMASIADO GENIAAAAAAAAL ❤
Always banger songs!
sister act and league crossover XD
Probably an unpopular opinion; as outstanding as this video is, the animation, the music choice; it's probably my least favourite of the collection. While other videos had great music to compliment the animation, this feels too much as though the video is trying to compliment the music. Reminds me a bit of what a college student would create for a performing arts piece. Although it is my least favourite, it's still outstanding!
🤩🤩😇😇
Calling it now: the golden divine energy that seeps into Ambessa's unborn child at 3:37 is why Mel Medarda has a golden theme going for her, and also why she survives Arcane season 1 ending unscathed (you can actually see the golden "armor" shine in the last seconds of S1E8 and the first seconds of S2E1)
YOU BETTER LOVE WHAT YOU SEE
Ambessa showed up in season 1 and the whole world said WHO IS SHE
Did anyone noticed the baby? 🙀💥
ooooh that's Sheryl Lee Ralph?! She's done so much lately. So much after growing up watching her on Moesha.
I feel like Ambessa took some type of deal with the Black Rose to save herself and her unborn child or to gain power and now they're back trying to get a repayment. Since her son is gone, their after Mel which would explain Ambessa exiling her to Piltover. Now they followed both of them there and took Mel.
i like she's taking fatal strikes and the animation seems to give her a zombie like shamble at some points Like yeah she should have died then but didn't.
BRO I JUST REALIZED SHE WAS PREGNANT
Whoever decided they should use Sheryl Lee Ralph deserves a raise.
Que mal que le pega el mejoralito a Riot. Ya ni ellos saben a donde van.
insert powerful black woman insert furries insert a genderless they them, flashbacks to flavery, preminitions of a futeristeic powerful version of her. Then shes fights giga pantheon.
Caralho!!!
La  primera  vez que no me gusta una canción ni el cantante en un video de riot
Anyone else notice at 0:45 the side eye Kindred gives to her stomach when coming to take her?
3:38 hi Mel
RIOT GAMES COOKING SPECTACULARLY 🗣️
I love this video
they can never make me like you ambessa medarda.
Barbara from Abbott Elementary ATE this vocals! Iconic!
nổi da gà
Why is this so cryptic, so weird, wtf is even happening in this video
I've lost count of how many times I've watched this
So I need a full story of Ambessa... Wow, that woman wow
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Do you see that? Strong black woman and noone complain. Why? Cause good writing.
ms howard killing it !!
Im listeling this clip whit Metallica, For Whom The Bell Tolls
3:17 masterpiece
The scene when her reflection off the shield shows her face flash that sinister look is so sick
her voice speaks VOLUME
not so good
làm nhạc còn hay hơn làm game :v
She looks like Bretman Rock
Hear me out, Riot. One year, for april fools. Ya'll should add a game mode that reverts graphic and champions to their og state. I wanna see people deal with diplomatic poppy again.
literally never gonna get sick of this music and visual. 3:18 goes extremely hard with that stance oh goodness i am not ok. the deep bass(?) right before the flashing. ourghhh....
Bad music video, wasted 50 hours of my life 🙄😒
Ameeeeeeii❤❤❤❤ prft
riots effort level balancing their games: ehhh we will get to it eventually   Riots effort making shows, mvs etc this is going to be the greatest thing since sliced bread
theory:| The lamb is symbolism for her unborn child and how her ascendance [revelation etc] will forever be tied to her child
Masterclass
Pantheon training embessa, Kindred (lamb and wolf reference) representing death coming to her, Swain and Katarine in background indicating Noxus conquering Targon and she becomes part of Noxus.. and near the end, she revived by her baby Mel that glows up similar to the series Arcane where Embessa revived and takes the arrow out. Incredible
Such a powerful voice. Kind of song I would like to hear before writing my exams.
Wait, Woodkid was one of the ones producing this?  With him collabing with Alex on 2 songs in Arcane (1 for each season), does that mean he got involved more with Riot/Arcane's music production?  Can't wait for the behind the scenes of Arcane 2 from Alex.
DD?
Deam
Amazing 🎉🎉❤
"In order to win you must be both the fox and THE WOLF"

esta rifado
now that I see the video for a second time I think Kindred let her live because of the daughter :o
I was googly heart eyes for Ambessa when she showed up the first time in Arcane. Now seeing a full-fleshed out character makes me fall head over heels for her.
2:27 Katarina omg
Ambessa超美超帥氣的~~~
At least its better than linkin park one lmao
Just realized she pulled the arrow out of herself and didn't instead break it.. tsk-tsk no good, no good. Never pull the things that pierced you Then again, that's a magical baby inside of her..
THIS IS SOOOOOOO GOOD
I was raised by wolves I was born to lead And I starve 'til there's no more mouths to feed There's a hand on my throat And a blade at my feet But the weight of the world won't bend my knees  [Pre-Chorus] Broken bones, battle scars I have seen the bloodshed Carved in stone, when it's my sword They won't forget  [Chorus] No war, no peace 'til I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know  [Verse 2] I can use who I want And I taste what I please In this world I get all my fantasies There's a hand on my throat And a child at my feet But the weight of the world Won't bend my knees See upcoming pop shows Get tickets for your favorite artists   [Chorus] No war, no peace 'til I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know  [Interlude] Don't wash away my blood Don't wash away my sweat It's all I know Don't wash away my tears  [Pre-Chorus] Don't wash my spirit, don't cleanse my soul Can't break my courage, and I won't fall ’Cause that's all I know  [Chorus] No war, no peace 'til I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know
2:59 THANK YOUUUU FOR THESE VOCALS!!!! LORD HAVE MERCY
😮
Was she chosen by the wolf Kindred?
So Ambessa went to war, pregnant? While during my pregnancy all I did was sleep and become a potato??? She has my upmost RESPECT.
The Ms. Sheryl Lee Ralph? THE SHERYL LEE RALPH? SHUT UUUUUP! OH MY GAAAAAHD! She's perfect for embodying Ambessa. My Deena, My Mrs. Howard, My Madame Morrible! Great casting, Riot!
Is Ambessa a Solari?
El temazo
I don’t get it.
I hope to see this show in World 2024 😢😢
KINDRED EATING IT UP
What a powerful voice!
This guy in Arcane who killed by spear this monster from zaun, is this Pantheon?
It's cool to see that since we're talking about a Noxian, Kindred is only the wolf and the lamb is nowhere to be seen.
SHES LIKE A FEMALE KRATOS.
SHE WAS PREGNANT ON THE BATTLE FIELD? She literally couldn't be more impressive if she tried
Masterpiece, and what powerfull voice!
3:02 ambessa abs
Man Ambessa is such a badass, she's hot, she's buff, she's crazy powerful and intimidating. What more could you want from a female champion. (shoutout to LoL doing fem heroes right)
Wait so this is how she canonically got those scars?
Another good gym motivation soundtrack👍🔥🔥🔥
Not sure why this only hast 4,4M clicks. Its a masterpiece.
"A wolf has no mercy* Yet a wolf showed mercy to her
Waiiiit. This was performed by Mrs. Howard?? Holy****, slay!
Ambessa my goat
i wonder what she stole
요약 : 자꾸 지는게 노스킨 때문인거 같아서 스킨사는 대용
Наконец что-то стильное. Я скучал по великолепно анимации и эффектам. Спасибо.
I regret that I just found out about this
Probably worst of all the official Riot songs. Still good, but really in NOOOO camparison AT ALL to ANY of the other Riot songs😢
Who else is rewatching this after watching arcane?
AMBUSSY
Now Ambessa is a badass female character. With all the DEI inserts in other games and media,Riot actually makes interesting and compelling characters
YESSSSSSSSSS
Back here after watching Arcane2  Mama Ambessa ROCK
This was top tier. I'm even more intrigued about her backstory.
I love women who can kill me
no me rendiere hasta que este muerto en batalla
So looks like the Wolf is judging her spirit on 3 different planes... Which probably all test something different. Fear, Will, Emotion...She sheds a tear for her son as he holds the lamb... She seems to pass these judgements and is allowed a vision of herself as ruler.  She is also shown in her legendary on every plane... Chosen after sacrificing the lamb, being resilient in battle and seemingly dancing away her emotions and shedding that last tear... Once the light hits her as it did the other champions she becomes one. Champions look to test others as she was tested. I dont know if she rejects her legendary by not dying when it seem like the magic of her daughter awakens her with a jolt of light from death... But she returns and rises and it seems Mel's light disrupted the process and the Wolf leaves the battlefield... Ambessa got all the bells and whistles this was epic in every sense of the world. The band and Sheryl Lee Ralph are amazing and the visuals were breathtaking
This hits harder after watching Arcane season 2 ngl
Am I the only one who thinks 3:02 is very weird and cringe ? loved everything except it
É uma série ou jogo?
rkatanaswirds$
ronitachowdhuryralph
blm woke lgbtq trash company
was that mcfucking kindred i just saw being relevant to her story
riot needs a theme park
이 뮤직비디오는 미쳤습니다..
I'd KILL to see Ambessa fight Darius. That would be a match of the ages!!!!
Epic❤
2:08 where she rolls over and starts crawling to the beat really exudes the power and determination she has during this trial, gets me every time
I'm not familiar with her lore, but I have a question on the baby - is that Mel in the womb, or her brother? I always assumed that the brother was older. So would this be her first child, or has she already had a baby before going to war? She looks pretty young to be a mom...
👏👏👏Невероятно классно, а бит качает просто зашибись!!! Невероятно круто, как всегда на высшем уровне! 👍👍👍
NOT BARBARA HOWARD YALL
The will to live. That's all
Came back after watching Arcane Season 2, and boy this is really fire!
I had just fired one of the character creators who has brought the most new mechanics to the game and no one says anything :/
No idea what is going on, but the music is awesome
Her baby had a violent death and so she fought to accept and let go the  tragedy. I love her lore
Wait wait wait... Didn't Ambessa have a son...? And isn't that her son in the statute at 2:17 holding a lamb.. cuz he was killed? So the lam is symbolic of a peaceful death right..? Even tho he was murdered, I assume Kindred didn't want the child to suffer. I watched this so many time wondering why she was crying and now I got it XD so slow I am
Me encantó ❤🎉🎉
So wolf has mercy after all
Aatrox: *Orders a coffin*
It took me a shameful amount of time to realize this was about Ambessa.
No subtitle 🥲
this is RIOT, mthrfckr....
LoL Cinematic Universe > Marvel Cinematic Universe.
After watching Act1, Ambessa is scary...
WOW I cried, this was beautiful
월즈랑 이거랑 영상이 바뀐거 같은데
Songs are getting more and more mid meh
umm
パンテオン（超越者？）と戦ってるのはなんで？
Где найти только музыку без слов как в начале игры за амбессу в лиге легенд?
When Giants came out, it really felt like it was missing that extra oomf. Im so glad this delivered
Doctor: "You're pregnant. You must take it easy."  Ambessa: "No! We're going to war!"
pesada es la perona
HER VOICE IS SOOOO GOOD
Lyrics: I was raised by wolves I was born to lead And I starve till there's no more mouths to feed There's a hand on my throat And a blade at my feet But the weight of the world won't bend my knees  Broken bones, battle scars I have seen the bloodshed Carved in stone, when it's my sword They won't forget  No war, no peace Till I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know  I can use who I want And I taste what I please In this world I get all my fantasies There's a hand on my throat And a child at my feet But the weight of the world Won't bend my knees  No war, no peace Till I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know  (Don't wash away my blood) (Don't wash away my sweat) It's all I know (Don't wash away my tears)  Don't wash my spirit Don't cleanse my soul Can't break my courage And I won't fall ’Cause that's all I know  No war, no peace Till I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know
I love everything about this
3:33 Am I confused or are some soundseffects similar to "Throw me to the Wolves" by Future Royalty?
Pulling the arrow out of her abdomen? Is she stupid? She just made certain death... well.. certain.
Ninguém esta nem ai mais pra esse jogo abandonado entupido de script hack hydra e outros. Só pessoas doentes que jogam perceba o perfil de quem joga e tipo de pessoa que tu deve se afastar. RIOT TEncend esta cagando para vocês e eu aproveito tira saro dos inuteis gastando tempo de vida em um joguinho arruinado, achando que algum dia vão e alguem dentro de algo arruinado.
Well done Riot, well done ♥️
The animation is so beautiful, I can't handle it.
오잉???그래서 이 친구는 여자야?남자야??????????????
The whales would say her body is unrealistic and that Pantheon should be cancelled.
Может хватит добавлять в Игры Капчёных если  чесно это надоедает они и так по всюду ещё и на троны их сажают вам самими это не остачертело?
Sheryl Lee has made me fall in love with her just from this performance alone.
A constant rewatch after the first watch, this is awesome! Beyond words, truly, everything about it..
Повезло дуре что кровью не истекла когда стрелу вытащила
Sherl Lee Ralph is in a league of legends all on her own. Great song, and great use of her voice!
MIZEEERA BOY, QUE MUSICA BOA DA PORRAAAAA
Fortiche the best
If you believe in yourself and with a tiny pinch of magic, all your dreams can come true
insane
if they're ever going to make a second batch of the wolf's chosen I'd love for olaf, tryndamere, and kled to be in it.
а че чел на марсе арену не дает
I wanna see a person who is both a skilled drummer and stilt walker cosplay as one of those tall dudes.
That last shot on the shore almost looks like a reference to Eugene Bracht's "The Shore of Oblivion" painting
I just realized she was in Sister act, and my mom loved that when i was a smol boi :D my baby memory kicked in lol
Que voz, que letra...  Uma obra prima para a segunda temporada <3
No closed captions is CRAZY. Most of their video has subtitles but this one doesn't????
이렇게 잘 만들면서 롤드컵주제곡은 왜 끄따위로 했냐?
mano do céu que coisa linda
me encontro viciada nessa musica
How Abessae gets her own music video? She is not even a game character yet. Why not make another clip like Enemy with several main characters from Arcane, but not the side character Ambessa
This song is just TOO GOOD x_x
ебать, как же это ахуенно.
This singer is an actual actress as well.
As always, Noxus has the correct opinion: dying by the lamb is cucked.
tem umas parte da música q a voz parece até q foi feita por IA kkkkkk
:3
They got Sheryl Lee Ralph on this?!?! That's Mrs Barbara Howard!!!!
Sooo this is just lore for the skinline or....  I know pantheon (the aspect) is dead bc of Aatrox but dam @ 3:29 that transformation seemingly provided by the "Mark of wolfs chosen" that lamb gives makes it feel like she inhearted the aspect also...  Or was it all for her to refuse to die and save Mel that she leget just fought the aspect of war (or bcause of the skinline that was pantheon)  and gained wolfs favor and mark and was allowed to live.
Pantheon  MENTIONED!!!
Falaram que a cinematic ficou incrivel mas eu achei bem mais ou menos, ficou legal mas nao chega nem perto das antigas. Sinto saudade de quando a riot criava cinematic realmente boa e nao criava so cinematic no mesmo estilo grafico o tempo todo.
In greek mythology it was said that the Spartans (the best and cruelest warriors) ate a thing called black broth wich was made with raw meat, blood, sweat and tears. Ambessa being a ruthless warrior sith a song like that is awesome.
THE SHERYL LEE RALPH!?! MS. BARBARA!!!
뮤비 -> 민심 떡락, 오프닝 -> 민심 복귀, 트로피 뽀뽀쪽 -> 나락
The visuals riot has bee coaxing over the past few years have really come into their own. This video is absolutely insane gorgeous, and the universe feels more and more distinct.
피땀눈물이네요
One of the best MV and music you've ever ced
dislike
its the same producer of joker 2?Jjajajaja
Oh boy, I bet Necrit had a field day with this!!!
Boosteroid is the future of cloud gaming
Serious gamers will love Boosteroid's reliability
Serious gamers absolutely have to try Boosteroid
really cool how noxian kindred is waaay more wolf like cause no noxian accepts defeat, so wolf is all they get
animation I liked  music eh
αιμα δακρυα κ ιδρωτας σακης ρουβας 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wait, wait, wait THEE SHERYL LEE RALPH?!?!?!!
Having Sheryl here when I love Abbott Elementary is such a fever dream rn
wow
Blood, sweat and tears of BTS.😅
Как же это круто!!!!!
scrolled through so many comments and haven't seen anyone mention sevika's reflection at 1:57
esta cancion es una maldita adicción necesaria DEEEEOOOOS <3
Young Ambesa? I'm alread loving!!!!
Cuz I am broken... when I saw the name my brain went "...Nae pi ttam nunmul nae majimak chumeul Da gajyeoga, ga... " 😅
having a better animatic for a champion vs one for worlds is insane...
Riot had to stop making games and just make history, for our sake
Lame woketard champion, Captain Farron was 100x times better option
The visuals go so HARD, but the element that ties it all together is Sheryl, her voice gives the lyrics power and the vibe that the one singing is a battle hardened warrior whose innocence was eroded away by war.   "No fears or sorrows underneath these bones" such a PERFECT delivery 🙏🙏
I liked it, wish there was some shots of Ambessa fighting in her full armor.
Better than 2024 Worlds Anthem
2:57 Watching this a second time, and I love the little wolf heads! While I don’t play the game and am no expert, Kindred is what caught my eye for League of Legend lore, so I’m happy to be seeing them again after Still Here!
After watching necrits about this. It all makes sense now!
this song is top tier!
They should just focus on making music and shows that bring people together in agreement with how good they are… Instead of… that game with that community ;)
MALISIMO
low key re used animations from Vi 2:04 vi and jinx fighting 2:09 How she rolls over - vi under rocks in season one   first scream looks like vi s How she sits on throne looks like jinx
bts's song blood sweat and tears is so much better for this videoline! Mute original audio and play bts's song, it will be on beat and also end perfectly in timing.
🤌
Is she Ambessa? Wolf didnt touch her because she is also wolf
Incredibly well done
Swain and Kata so badass
whats this garbage ?
okay I am a lover of League of Legends lore and even I barely understood most of what I saw.
que mrd es esto riot esta re fulero
these lyrics are every 40 year old trailer trash woman on Facebook posts 🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂😂
Alors, l’intention est bonne, la musique est cool, mais la réalisation.. ils sont passés où vos graphistes ? L’animation est plutôt bof, voir pas terrible pour une entreprise comme Riot, soit..
This is why Animation will always be superior to Live-Action.
What a disgusting song. Worst league of legends song ever!!
This is insanity.  I cried watching this. It's so beautiful and heartbreaking yet tragically impowering. The animators behind this are sick for this. Heavens bless them and the blood sweat and tears they put into make something so breathtaking.❤❤❤
gotta love the more noxian kindred and the drumming creatures look like their smth from warframes duvani realm i think its called duvani not sure also they look similar to jhin and play in 4s coincidence? I THINK NOT
Swain, Katarina, Pantheon
vry pog
Riot music is just MVP
ambessa is Dr. gaul in hunger game
The call, Still here, and the Panth theme were my favorites. And this one is by far my new BEST 👌
Sheryl Lee Ralph the RESPECT😍😍😍
as bad as joker 2
Se fueron al carajo, está buenísimo
Some of these cuts reminded me of A Secret Door by Avatar. Phenomenal music video, for any metalheads or dancers out there.
gives me "be prepared" from the Lion king vibes. that is to say I like it a lot.
John 3:16-19 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. 19 This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. 20 Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. 21 But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God. roman 10:9 if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
gets her assed kicked and then sits on a throne? Lame af
YOU ARE TELLING ME THAT HER DAUGHTER WICH WE ALL KNOW WHO IT IS, HAS SOME SORT OF POWER TOO AND NEXT ARCANE WELL SEE WHAT IT IS. DAMM
I can’t even tell you the last time I watched a music video but I love this
Is Medarda or new aspect?
This is dumb!
awesome
Então é assim que vcs declaram q ele já está vindo?
The best creation yet. THIS MY JAM
"In this world i get all my fantasies" The tone in which the word fantasies  is spoken drives me crazy
Alright good, now BUFF NASUS Q!!!!!!
Incredible musix
Im sorry but AAABBSSSS
Oml insane as always rito league of legends.
Mommy medarda is way too hot 🥵
This song is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Barbara Howard of Abbott Elementary! Is that you???
This has no right to go this hard... sheesh!
Riot Legenda o vídeo acessibilidade PF!!
can something be to awesome? Is that a thing? I think i got awesomitus. no cure.
Well, Fortiche.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man i want this to be opening song for Arcane man this boping so hard
The armor pieces and weapons glimmer in the same way as Mel's shoulder and back pieces
Kindred is still here!
was the baby mel? from arcane cause it had the same glow as her in the final scene(I'm coping cause i hope she is ok lol)
Wait, Barbara from Abbott elementary is the singer? !!!!! The duality and talent that woman has!!!
Pantheon looking extra juicy manly there 1:23... Mmmm i want his spear to 😊
BTS
I didn't know they were Solari! Then that means the girl they killed must have been part of the Lunari...
why the viego pose💀
I dont like this (veteran player comment)
May anak siya?😊
Наглядный пример как качественно сделать сильного и харезматичьного женского персонажа 👍😁, Рад что это не очередная аниме девочька или эмо бой😂.
I WANT K/DA ❤❤
Wolf chases what does not willingly go
WE WUZ SPARTANS AN SHEEEEIT!
i seriously like the song and the cinematic video!
why BANGALORE is here?
2025?
It is so good that tears start coming to my eyes
The imagery of Ambessa sacrificing a sacred lamb to embrace the wolf is just, mwah, chef's kiss.
So she proved to be hard feeder and instead of being banned she got crowned? Is it some kind of DEI?
I love ittttttt
Very poor song choice but excellent CG trailer
Why isnt anyone talking about the ruined king Viego pose?
피땀눈물이네?
MISS SHERYL LEE RALPH FROM ABBOTT ELEMENTARY AND DREAMGIRLS WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!!! (positive)
판테온은 그냥 전설로 나왔으면 지렸을것 같은데
3:11 - закосплеила Виего
The quality of this video is incredible
When will we change League of Legends category from Gaming to Music??
Always remember she always protects you. You think she is weak and stupid but no one is smarter than the one who sees the outcome. If you want to surpass her then you have to see further than her...no...no...no you have to see further than the great way they have seen.😁
Dnd another new reason not to play the game for the next few months till they get this one fixed
Wow 😮
Now imagine if this song was the worlds anthem, so much potential.
I hope the story of Arkein 2 will not focus on the old black grandmother🙏
volta draktar
volta draktar
volta draktar
tanto hype pra isso? só ficou legal a Kindred.
What an awesome piece of art. ❤
idk why this this made me tear up but it did 😢
God
Oh Jinx gonna be so much cooked
can we get Imagine Dragons back?
The first half of this songs images definitely inspire by Salvador Dali
TOP 5 Riot Cinematics:  1. Breathe 2. Blood, Sweat & Tears (this) 3. Awaken 4. KDA - Villain 5. KDA - Pop/Stars
Sheryl’s vocal is too powerful ❤ This song gave me a crazy amount of goosebumps 😂
Ambessa is the new aspect of war, prove me wrong.
I LUW KINDRED LORE <3
페이커 아케인2에 까메오로 나와야한다

Is this a BTS reference?
The cinematics, paired with the strong vocals of the singer gave me chills
The voice, animation, and short story. They don't miss when it comes to this. Thats why arcane is so good.
Game on
speechless. they cooked here.
wonhae mani maniiiii 💜
Como siempre los del pelo blanco son mas llamativos. Igualmente no entendi nada el video :D
League of legends never miss😂😂😂❤❤
Go back to kitchen leave Thanos trone😂
This is my absolute favourite leage music video. Even thogh Ambessa as a champ is so op
where's my KDA?
Griffith but black
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
new champion?
Sherly lee Ralph haven't herd that name for awhile..... 🤭
2:50 the bweee woo wah under everything is one of my favorite parts.
bad
These drummers hit +100% if you once saw the animation ❤
Fun fact: Riot even made a game to promote their music.
2:39 literal chills.
이쯤되면 예술이다
cringe
I really dont want to be a hater but I cannot stand the music Riot releases and puts in their cinematics.
Way too much DEI and Satanism
The Thumbnail really looks like the highlighted Person got too short arms
i want that weed
Good! I missed the rock songs here in LoL. Enough of kpop hahaha
no entendi ni mergas
Does anyone find those tall drum guys cool??
jakieś takie bez polotu, słabizna.
Ambessa the wolf and Mel the lamb?
Bloed, zweet en traaaaaanen! Gekoloniseerd
ficou muito bonito
I'm praying that this singer performs at worlds 2024 opening
아케인 워윅 없는것도 서러운데 선택하는자 워윅 이런거라도 만들어주지
wheres schnee when you need him
The grit in Sheryl Lee Raph’s voice gives me life my god. And the way her voice breaks on “can’t break my courage”.   I’m going to be listening to this forever.
Круто 🔥🔥🔥
В мире riot закончились белые люди ...
Pas non c’est français
Vander is such a good doggy (Warwick)
Cinematics, lore, soundtracks, 11/10. Gameplay: 1/10. I hate how watching this made me want to play the game anymore knowing I will have the worst time of my life
Blessed by both Lamb and Wolf. Hail queen Ambessa! .... Mel having Kindred as her godparents, headcanon accepted.
warch the clip , get hipped, open client , play game , lock ambessa ,  lose , close league .......and cycle repeat itself
As someone who's never played LoL, I never understand what's going on in its trailer, but I keep watching them :P
1:50 , the all desert cene, must be the same animation of Love,Death and Robots 's episode, Jibaru. Has any one else, seen that?
There are 2 wolves inside of you, The Alpha and The Beta, and this cinematic shows exactly why you have no friends and are cringe.
AYO this indie animation company is so good,
banger
Ясно продвижение негры
Just another amazing work!! Amazing👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
When yall realise this is Mrs. Barbra from Abbot Elementary singing.... 😮  Go head sheryl !!! 🎉❤
ARCANE IS PEAK LIVING 🔥🗣❤💙🔥
Just a stepping stone.😞
Who can you win? You are just an ordinary person. This path is full of humiliation, no one will share your pain, not even those you are trying to protect. Stop while you still can.😭
again this LGBT+ajhsgdfgHJAFSGSJDFGKJSb, im soo tired of this
😭😭😭
Someone love Linage II, hello orc women with fists.
I love how on 2:15 even though the lamb ( her innosence) is being torn apart by the multiple fights and losing comrades and hope in them yet it never stops regenerating but once she was offered the option of wolf heart at 2:48 the lamb stopped being endlessly torn apart and instead desintegrated to fuel the creation of the more reselient version.
Can anyone shed some light on the weird alien creatures?
Not for victory... not for glory... just for a petty selfish reason..."human".😥

Not me thinking this would be a cover of bts’s blood sweat and tears…
🤰🏾
Espera, então a provação dos kindred nessa animação era para salvar a filha dela (supostamente a Mell)? ou era para salvar a ambas?
cringe
I never noticed she was pregnant
해석하자면, 죽음을 관장하는 신 킨드레드가 목숨을 거두어 가지 않고, 선택 했다는것 같음. 일개 한낱 인간따위가... 아케인 시즌1 보면 전설적인 인물 정도로만 묘사되었는데 이런 과거 있었을줄이야.
Jinx is cooked this gal does not play when it comes to battle oml 😭
q bosta
hot
Meramente cinema
Noooo, break not yoink!! Break not yoink!! Yoinking it out only causes more damage and more bleeding smh
Ambessa the new Tina Turner? ooorrrr whaaaa!
AI로 만든거 아니지?
DITO ISTO, SOU MAIN AMBESSA! BOM DIA!
So ambessa is an ascendant candidate? Or a failed vessel for the aspect of war
yall too good on making movies. now lets play.
pue smr
Sheryl absolutely killed it WOW
1:36 Reminds me of that episode of Love Death and Robots, specifically S3 EP 9
So, she is a DEI Character, she lost her fight over and over again then just was placed in a position of power.
AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
А это просто трейлер линейки скинов...
How am I meant to think Ambessa is a villian in Arcane when SHE IS SO BADASS, AND THE LYRICS MAKE HER FEEL LIKE A HEROCI LEADER!
why did kindred let her live ?
KATARIANAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA RAINHA
dejen de agregar mas camionas 🤮🤮🤮
I don’t get it this video clip is so strange
Omg shes beautiful 😭
Okay they sold me on her.
Буд-то старенькая Шер пела, ну камон, лучше не придумали? ( я как бы про неё ничего плохого не имею)
So Kindred was supposed to elect Ambessa as one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse but she choose her son over that powers presented to her ?
Shame on them not making Kindred the legendary, the way it looks in here is insane
암베사가 판테온의 제자에, 킨드레드한테 힘까지 받은 사람이면 걍 준초월자급이네
0:43 she looks so much like Mel here, it breaks my heart
this is amazing, i have so much more respect for Ambessa 😳
Fiquei de xereca🤚😐🤚
will be my least fav league song i guess idk
Ambessa the most fear League of Legends Champion Character
Just my thought, but this song will fit even worlds song
So glad Arcane S2 will also be on my birthday
I love it
stop forcing sjw garbage in our videogames, pls

월즈뮤비 새로내놔라 이럴거면
I think the child holding the lamb is her elder son, and that she cries because he's unable to let go and "in all things become The Wolf"
OHHH It's Ambessa Medarda from Arcane
reta rds
The animation and the song are both fantastic!
only if riot would make their games as great as their songs
So EPIC 💜🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This song needs to be performed at World's please
Okay i guess now its my second one favored work from riot after Rice. So much lore and fresh sound. Almost the best
Ambessa's voice givin me "Big Feet Energy."
Obsessed with this song and music video! I’m also begging for someone to cosplay Ambessa’s armour at 3:26 😍.
Just epic !
This generic music has always been boring. Lol realy needs to try other gengres...
Пантиеон контрпик амбессы :)
she's been through a lot
The song is A Banger !! The fact that they use Ambessa VA Is the Cherry on top..
Creo q se pasaron de hacerlo con IA

@3:58 Did you see the rocks on the right??? That is THE GRAND CANYON AREA OF THE U.S.!!!! League Of Legends is ALL ABOUT THEM COMING HERE TO THE SO-CALLED: "PROMISE LAND"!!! BUT THEY KILLED AND SUBUGATED GOD'S PEOPLE!!!! FACTS!!!!!
This is what we want in black panther
Every Cinematic is better when Pantheon show's up 🎉🎉🎉. Keep up the great work!
wait, I'm not good at interpreting symbolism, but it looks like she sacrifices the lamb 1:51 (her unborn child mel?) to kindred perhaps. the fetus' eyes glow gold. and at the end of season 1 arcane, it looks like mel has some sort of gold magic to save herself from jinx's death rocket, maybe kindred ult that makes her and anyone close to her invulnerable? I'm grasping at straws here with two baincells.
Seeing this puts so much context on her obsession with Mel’s weakness.
Riot needs to stop making game things and just do shows, videos and music I swear.
Wow so epic
cool man.... oh wait.... again? rly? eh, someone still dont understand this thing dont work? sad
Animation so good it makes me wanna cry dude. THIS IS PEAK
"Leeave me WITH my DEmons" her voice is insanely powerful it's like I can hear her singing with her whole heart, soul, throat, and stomach.  Gorgeous voice!!!
Too much black thems😏🤮
I have no words.
Deixe de abracar a ovelha. Se torne o lobo
Fun fact the woman singing this is Sheryl Lee Ralph who plays Barbara in Abbott elementary
This kindred, gave a second chance... dont take her life... why?
This is beautiful from a storytelling standpoint
não foi ruim, más não foi o melhor
I only remembered of BTS now 😂😂😔
They still are amazing at making videos
Kind of Boring. These cinematics are getting worse and worse. Soulless. I liked Kindred wolf.
3:07  What’s the paint on her face for when she seems like she’s going to break.
The wolf subtley looking at her and then her stomach says a lot.
The only things are still good in League, is cinematics...
Why do you put as the main character in a video a black person considering whites and asians are the most of your player base?
I am goosebumps so powerful 🤯
La miniature est éclaté mais le clip est fou
Can you explain me, the white man is the villain and the black women... men is the kind... It's hard to tell, you look like a man but with a woman's name, like wookism is in lol or something ?
방탄소년단 노래인 줄 알았어요
2:07. Pantheon catching Ambessas torso in his shield then slamming her into the ground was absolutely brutal.
If you have something stuck in your body you shouldn't remove it because it stops the bleeding a bit. So she kinda killed herself at the end
I dont think mel dies, but I feel she gets injured some way and thsi ties into ambessas protectivness over her children and fighting to keeo them safe (at the end when she clenched her stomach)
I had listen to this gem 100 times .....Riot knows the feelings and emotions of gamers.
Una falopa maneja este video
Riot x Fortiche is always a banger
1:19 KSI? That you?
Pulling out an arrow like that is going to damage you more than letting it be
trash  greedy lgbtq game 🙂
The chosen of the wolf are deliverers of death. Warriors go to them to die.
just masterclass
Obsessed with this song
small indie company , big music company , you guys have one individual laptop for a server for each region
terrible, from the last cinematic to this? is this downgrade or what?
God solo me falta tirar a su banner y sacarla
So she noticed that she was pregnant!!! And so she decided it was not the time to die !!!
👎🏻  🤡

HOLY SH!!! 😶 This is absolute BANGER!!! 🔥 I've got goosebumps all over my body, and some kind of anger, miggt and sorrow at the same time in my heart.... 💥
More lore than shaco
Совсем не зашло…
.
give Ambessa's VA a MASSIVE pay raise
I think her soul was being judged by death. It seems like the spirit of death before the split into kindred/wolf, as the mask is much different and has a more even blend of both aspects (light/dark or peace/violence). The lyrics themselves are tightly woven into what is happening. Her soul is scarred from her struggles which mainly seem to stem from violence and fighting. She has a goal to lead, represented by the throne she desires so much that she's practically crawling at some point. Her demons are the thoughts and belief she has that the only way to achieve peace, is to be on top no matter what that requires from her.  Injured after a battle, death comes to her. It sees how much will she has to live and it offers her a chance. Her baby's soul, represented as the lamb, is offered up as a sacrifice as she's harassed by her inner demons. Although she seems to try and protect it at first, her dream of ruling overtakes the desire to protect her innocent child. We see the anguish of it, but also the side of her that is determined and full of conviction to keep on fighting/climbing. I believe in a way, this sacrifice hardens her spiritually/mentally/emotionally as it's represented as armor -cold, hard, and unyielding as she keeps moving forward. But then I think the baby is still possibly alive. Energized by some energy, possibly because it inherits Ambessa's strength and character or the wolf sees both worthy to keep on struggling.

A I listen to this song when I sleep so I have music to listen to in my dreams so I can keep fighting against the combian along side the rebels of earth
I'm back here for like the millionth time. This...was...EPIC!!!
Chills chills literal chills... The vocal just omg 🔥🔥
This should have been 2024 world Hymn, not that LP whine.
Amazing, this has to be one of the most impactful music videos from League of Legends. Again WOW.
This music motivate me that don't surrender even when i feel wishing to die....
PEAK.
pas ouf
❤❤❤❤
Pantheon - 3  Ambessa - 0
the kindred came again and prove your worth....to resist death and prevail...
All of this only to go off and murder Ionian civilians by the score later for literally no other reason than Noxian pride lmfao 💀💀
não chega aos pés da pior cinemática de wow
That child is kino,right?

Why does it sound like 'TRIPLETS BORN, THE THRONE AWAITS! THE SEER WARNS OF A DEADLY FATE!"

Mega trash. The champ isn't a young person. Why end with a version of the champion that doesnt even slightly resemble the character. Why not show her as a general or whatever, leading armies. Why not show  the champion you actually made. How embarrassing.
Watching this with the devs at lightbox expo was the coolest thing ever, I love you RIOT!!! The concepts and the design behind every decision was just perfection.
If I had a nickel for each time I saw a League of Legends character cement their badassary by fighting death and *winning,* I’d have two nickels. Which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it happened twice, right?
i notice something, ambessa ni the end of arcane 1 she blooms like the "fetus" in 3:37, so is she having his girl with powers and then she heals her?
choosen of the wolfs mordekaiser because he refused death maybe ?
“How to become Piltover’s local cuisine” is not what I expect to look up
Kinda dumb
honestl,.y i think Embessa looks better with the dreads then the short perm fro
why is she running around with faker in the desert?
Sn...
Okay Sheryl Lee Ralph they truly find some great voices to sing these songs 😮‍💨🙌🏾🙂‍↕️!!!!
Yes.
temazo
ok so... whats going on there?
NGl Better than the "world song " from linkon park this feels more like a worlds song
is she pregnant ?
Did kindred ulted her?
Sheryl Lee Ralph is going HARD on this one!
Why you gotta take the arrow out tho? Just leave it... that's Emergency Care 101
great, another diverse empowered ultra broken character ... we needed just that couse disney and netflix  are not enough ... Pantheon looks cool tho =)
이 뮤직비디오 만든팀들이 베테랑이고 가장중요한 월즈뮤비는 어디 신입들 데려다가 대충만들어서 팬들 다 실망시키고.. 도대체 라이엇팀들 인사과들은 뭘하고있는걸까. 내부감사 필요할듯. 이게 같은 팀에서 만든거라면 리소스 배분하는 리더를 반드시 해고해야할듯.
Consigo ouvir o Woodkid nessa música 🥹🤌🏻
shts goes hard 🔥
As criaturas pareciam estudantes da Federal em uma apresentação cultural, kkkkkk.
why did this make me so emotional
Mejor que la bosta del tema de Linkin xd 10/10
Sheesh she is hot
Amo con todo mi corazón league of legends. No soy fan de los juegos pero su historia, comics y sobre todo sus canciones uff de lejos lo mejor que me e topado de cualquier franquicia 💕💕💕💕💕
uhmmmm why is this better than the world song ? lol wtf
As an African American, I’m disappointed they’re going for a wakanda type music artist. We don’t need to be coddled anymore it’s 2024.
Calling it now,the next setting is sharima.
Jinx vs EVERYONE in the city of "progress"
the fact that shes pregnant with mel =x as seen at the end is insane
''Mouuuuuuuuuuuth, to feed''
Stop motivating me Riot 😖
То есть я правильно понял, Пантеон избил Амбессу, и она взошла на престол?:))) Впрочем видя 2024 год я даже не особо удивлен такому повороту событий)
Wait! Time out! Time out! Is that... Ambessa!?!
man, this is so good! love it
kindred my beloved
this made me appreciate ambessa even more and now i just know whatever comes after arcane will be absolute cinema
Soo she is a slave? Oh..
so many work for a perma ban champ :'D still good clip tho
I am gobsmacked. I love the singer's voice so I went to look up some of her other albums/work. Her last album was 40 years ago. To still be able to deliver this kind of performance is just incredible.
This is incredible, I love the singer's tone and everything!
Черная женщина на меня накричала

Nah but the scars being gold while she faces Pantheon, it reminds me of kintsugi (Japanese ceramic restoration method with urushi resin and gold or silver) and the symbol is beautiful. TBSkyen about to have a field day with that one
feels like disney music sequence
stop taking drogs kids , hahaha
Bring this to World
Buni grafikasi haqida o'ylashni o'zi bir azob shuncha mehnat musir qushiq uchun ketipti lekin😅
I LOVE this cinematic and song, its really getting in my top 3
LYRICS I was raised by wolves I was born to lead And I starve ’til there’s no more mouths to feed There’s a hand on my throat And a blade at my feet But the weight of the world won’t bend my knees  Broken bones, battle scars I have seen the bloodshed Carved in stone, when it’s my sword They won’t forget  No war, no peace ’Till I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat and tears Is all I know I can use who I want And I taste what I please In this world I get all my fantasies There’s a hand on my throat And a child at my feet But the weight of the world won’t bend my knees No war, no peace ’Till I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat and tears Is all I know [Don’t wash away my Blood, don’t wash away my Sweat, don’t wash away my Tears] Don’t wash my spirit, don’t cleanse my soul Can’t break my courage, and I won’t fall ’Cause that’s all I know No war, no peace ’Till I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat and tears Is all I know
Smash

Riot went full Disney
Riot make a music video that doesn't make me tear up: Challenge impossible
thats how you introduce characters baby
For GOD so Loved the world that He Gave His One and Only Begotten Son JESUS CHRIST, so that anyone who Believes in Him will not perish but have Eternal Life (John 3:16)
Something feels wrong and right at the same time to see Pantheon be the instructor. But those gold armors are sick. I don't like gold color but those are cool af.
이야.. 아무리 아케인 연관 신캐라지만ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ T1 뮤비랑 비교했을때 너무하잖어... 이렇게 개쩔게 만들면서..ㅠㅠㅠ
Sheryl Lee Ralph killed it! 🔥🔥
Aatrox Blood Sweat & Tears please
awesome song
Darius Blood Sweat & Tears please
Darius Escolhido pelo lobo plz
I've literally watched this one like 20 times, it's so good.
OMGGGG so beautiful ✨ black magic ✨
Ah... I get it, this video tell ambessa origins, she chose wolf path by sacrifice the lamb... And theres hint that Mel will awoke ambessa from the wolf path... Let see that in Arcane season 2
One word to describe this song “Powerful” just a banger
I thought BTS song😂😂😂
I love Ambessa's voice, the video is a work of art ❤❤
I cannot stress enough how insanely good her voice is
Cringe
Cara, o melhor acerto da Riot foram os Kindred. Não tem comoooooo, eu fico toda arrepiada!!!!
@MobileLegends ano na?
Not me imagining Sekhmet in Ambessa's position from first to finish. It just fit so well, considering what type of goddess she is.
i still love LEAGUE OF LEGENDS
The metalic sounds of swords clashing and shield deployment between 1:25 and 1:27 is insane. Timed with the music and everything... amazing
Song is on repeat 😤🙌🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥
Not this song making me emotional
Meh
T1이 갑니다 뮤비 다시 뜯어고치러😂😂😂
зачем стрелу вырвала, теперь не доживет до выхода... Ну а так, нормис.
I don't like american politics in my video games, can we just get cool stuff without real-life applications man?
one question who is the lucky dad who preg that sigma woman?🤣
Fortiche is one of the best studios of animated film for me. This looks insanely good. And the music is top tier as well.
Whats wrong with S14 Worlds MV?
This song better than champion 2024 song
Man it's such a good song, I hopes it won't get weaponize by woke ppl.
suco de pika
Watching this as a pregnant woman hits very different.
Heavy is the crown이나 똑바로 다시 만들고 나와라
I have no idea what's going, but I love it 😂
Maybe its just me overanalyzing; but I swear the arrow shot into Ambessa's stomach is in a slightly different position when she awakes at the end of the video then where it was when it started. It looks to be in a much safer spot to remove.
This one hits hard, right in the feels.
죽음을 받아들이는 것은 양을 껴안고 있는 것처럼 안락하다. 그러나 죽음을 극복하는 것은 늑대에게 물리는 것만큼 고통스럽다.
Ambessa crawling back up after that defeat scene sends chills. The song just bring out her path to life.
Soo wait since ambessa is blessed by kindred gifting the spirit of a wolf does that mean tryndamere is gifted by the spirit of the lamb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Goosebumps!
Wait i thought mel was adopted...
If this isnt the Arcane opening song for season 2, this is a missed opportunity❤❤❤ No war, no peace till I lead them all
I've been speculating on why the Pantheon is on the Arcane, and I think I have a clue.  First of all, seeing as there is no wound on his chest, it was probably before Pantheon fought Aatrox. It seems that he helped Ambessa with his combat training while already under the control of his Aspect personality. Since he is an “Aspect of War” he probably contributes to Noxus’ war effort.
Can RIOT please give players some beautiful characters? There are always old ones, fat ones, ugly ones, and black ones. Is RIOT invaded by political correctness? Or are you afraid of being beaten by Feminazi?
BLM
I cant get enough of this masterpiece❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Lyrics are nice but the vocals could of been better
oh hellyeah kindred in arcane
wings
沒字幕嗎？
Omg
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Still no new demacian champ...
Is this someone getting introduced in season 2? A lot of this feels like a completely separate story
love love love love <3 <3 <3
cant wait for  Opening ceremony of world
🕶🤘
Im done with illaoi, its Abessa time now
Okay what I get is her innocence taken apart by war(hence she fought pantheon the aspect of war(before aatrox killed the god) and in that cinematic after an intense battle somewhere (since noxus continuesly expands) her company lies dead, she's dying but she's being tested by kindred (the wolf on the opening and the lamb near the end) whether or not she chooses to fight on to live or let go in death. I assume she's pregnant too hence the fetus shot? And that was enough reason for her to live on. Basically in a nutshell
Fortiche bring us another banger.
amazing  RIOT DO THE SHURIMA THING THAT NECRIT SAID
I didn't enjoy this one as much.
할머니 두둥등장
Very mid song unfortunately.
Eu chamo isso de pura arte
nhà làm game làm MV quá đình đám
Shoutout to Studio Fortiche for this beautiful graphic style, top tier in every project they participate
This is my favorite Song that Riot produced by far☆☆☆
When she appeared in Arcane s1, the power she commands was obvious right from the start.  But respect for her might not have happened for all, she was meddling in Piltover's business after all.  Now S2 is about to drop, and Riot just made our respect for her skyrocket, it sets a precedent, and the message is pretty clear, Ambessa is NOT someone you wish to go against, she will fight you back, and that's –very likely– what our fav Arcane Gang is going to do... Honestly, chills. Can't wait, lmao.
Medardas worship Kindred as Death confirmed. Vs Swain's demonic power
She's pregnant?
Anyone in 2025?
My new main
thats so bad... we had awaken 5 years ago and now we got that? wtf are they doing with all their money
Why is this sounds like a song from Too Hot To Handle when someone gets rejected or something and a sad song comes in LMAO
@shauntrack :D pls
The most blatant scene is when Kindred straightens up. Pure goosebumps!
jou, bts refrence (sorry)
Remember moms, a battlefield is a terrible place for your unborn child.
So, you seen Vito?
people often forget league of legends/riot games is a video game company.... Its actually insane how every music video they release is an absolute banger.
Si algun dia por fin cierran los servidores de lol pueden dedicarse a este tipo de cosas, tremendo arte que acabo de ver.
is this supossed to be a new skinline? Because i can see there is pantheon,swain, and katarina
UHHHHH
This song, this visuals... OMG! It is a masterpiece!
this song is going to be played in opening ceremony worlds finals right?
4 mins of goosemumbs !!!
no entendi y la verdad 0 interes en el personaje en general xd
Please stop making games and start making only movies/series/etc. Best decision riot could ever do.
Quite curious on how much of this is canon to the Arcane universe, as here we see a younger Ambessa who seems already pregnant with Mel, since we have glimpses of a baby in the womb and she does seem to depict a bit of a pregnant belly. Which also brings back the theory of Mel having some sort of power from the final scene in season 1, since the baby's body and eyes glow gold like her tattoos, would mean that by being chosen by the wolf while pregnant the "blessing"(or whatever that is) Ambessa receives passed down to the baby in her womb.
I don't get hyped for things much these days; everything is nostalgia bait and poor writing. Arcane though, has me more hyped then I have been in over a decade.
Again they doing main charachter black. iNcLuSive indie-company
Cringe and bad
THIS VOICE IS SO POWERFUL!
The screenshots are great. Pantheon, Kindred, my love. The Western agenda with "diversity" and "weak oppressed women" is boring.
Another masterpiece.
the way the wolf leaves her reminds me of that short Darius cinematic from many years back. "What separates men from lesser men? Predator from prey? Fear. Predators smell it. And walk away when they don't."
it's so woke😅
Dishonored Vibes here
I've literally got goosebumps watching this......!!!!!!
I don't know why... but watching this I'm crying. This sounds just like hidden inner scream. Riot, your music brings me back life again
pretty cool
dislike for DEI and woke movement
This should have been the worlds music
ahora solo falta que el juego funcione.....
Why does it sounds like a Disney Musical segmente XD
un viaje de DMT se metió
It looks like a Iniko's clip
ta mt bom isso
Riot has released another piece of art.  On the verge of death/in a liminal state; wonderland/spiritual realm; trial after trial/nemesis; totem/faith; metamorphosis/rebirth.  The symbolism is incredibly powerful.
A masterpiece!
Feels like a (good) James Bond song.
Não acredito que chorei vendo clipe de bonequinho de jogo
basura, en decadencia primero era el juego ahora son las cinematica y la musica totalmente en decadencia
why do i have to download the game again now... rito please, let go of me already i'm tired..
They really need to stop pulling out whatever is stuck in a persons body xD
is forteesh working both on the arcane and these music videos? i hope they aren't stressed by execs...
Has anyone ever thought that this inclusivity of yours is already an insult to those very minorities. Well, supposedly you add a 100% stereotypical black woman with dreadlocks instead of hair. In addition to this, she is pumped up, although this is generally strange, because according to the agenda, she should be like a gragas. And she will shackle everyone with her shackles. Is it even normal for a black woman to be in shackles? Well, you know better        sylas slept with ksante and that what we have now
in loop
Masterpiece❤
yeah but when is teemo theme getting on spotify
no! don`t pull the arrow out, that`s unwise.
The video musical 😊           The champ 💀
very bad
Voice is so good
Thsi is sooooo cool that not any word can explain it’s beauty🔥🔥
Imagine performed by Teddy Swims
I thought this was a BTS song when I saw the title
no words…just applause 👏👏👏
Kindred wolf, was amazing!
Anyone else think this was a better worlds song? Idk The idea that faker works so hard. Regardless of his failures he gets up every single time and each of his victories. He puts the blood sweat and tears
necesito esto en spotify
Wait is ambesa the champion of death and pantheon his gatekeeper testing worthy souls.   What are you planing kindred.
crazy learning that the vocals on this song is Barbara Howard from Abbott Elementary
i love this animation style sm
These are the videos I hit the like button before watching them
ngl this skinline lowkey needs kled to be in it... kinda makes more sense the warrior yordle is one of them
Like, they dont know what they wanna show to us, and we dont understand this stoopid teledisc,  3/10 for all
Who is the singer of this song?
Did anyone else who's Black listen to the lyrics and feel as though the song was anointed by our ancestors?
Legendary on release is mental
Incredible
looks like ksi has competition
아니 라이엇아 티원 작년 월즈 영상이나 똑띠 만들지 이건 뭐임,,,? 이제보니 이거 만드는데 전념한다고 티원영상은 신경도 안쓴거구만 ㅡ ㅡ 진짜 킹받네
2:48 those tall things hitting hard ngl!
honestly this champ wont be anything i main and the singer is so far away from what music i listen to. but i love the song a lot and her voice is epic. thank you to everybody who made this song in RIot. i see you.
Is that pre-split Kinred?
3:14 This crescendo hits different🔥
A Shuriman, Noxian, Ascemdant and Piltover. Theres so much lore in this video... I need someone to explain this to me. Thanks Riot and the question is.... WHEN THE MMO?
Ta faltando criatividade. Algo novo, diferente e que nos faça refletir ou viajar mais.
Phanteón?...swain? Katarina?..kindred? Ambessa amedarda?
The detail of covering her scars with gold "Kintsugi" is so beautiful and well thought. Contrarty of her daughter she covers her scars not using gold lines for make up.
They lyrics! I need they Lyrics in spanish!! 🤭
Among all the cinematics this one seems the palest, the music is the same
Spotify cannot play 😵😵‍💫
Fortiche hired animation gods 🙏 what visual power and storytelling in 4 minutes. I honestly pray to god that at the end of arcane season 2 we’ll get a glimpse of the future collaboration
Que woke.. solo veo puras mujeres color carton empoderadas
Such powerful lyrics. Made me cry
Wtf im watching ...?
Where is @joeynato at right now ?! Beautiful doesn't even scrape it anymore, what an masterpiece no wonder by the likes of Fortiche! Well deserved praise. loving this
mid
Always happy to see cinematic with so much in it, with an AMAZING music behind. After Still here they give us this. I guess we all love kindred so much after this !
tendi nada
chills
이 노래를 위한 라이엇의 큰 그림 어후야♥♥♥ 린킨팍ㅆㅂ ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ 목소리와 노래 미쳤다 최고다!!!!
video about glorify losing?!!!!
who is she?
i deadass thought it's the bts' blood sweat and tears song lmaoo i was caught off guard lmaooksjdjsk
Imagine if shes a dragon- Oh wait, shes already in the game guys, just added more dashes
Is she noxian?
legends never die
this video could even dethrone rise - ironic that only fortiche can beat fortiche.
THE AURA OF BRYAN ADAMS-You Cant take me from the Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron
What i understand: she turned Kindred in some kind of speed/meth, got insanely high and fought the dead itself.  We all have been there
Truly well done on this one.  💯
What a great song ❤
Love it!
>tears the arrow out  soldier, thats not how you do that!
Kid with the goat reminds me of FE!N
Way better than garbage Linkin Park's.
Сильная негритянка ничего не скажешь
시발 이건 왜 또 퀄이 이렇게 좋은데??? 월즈곡이랑 이거랑 예산 잘못 쓴거 아님?
I don't know if someone commented on this already, but is she pregnant?! Btw love this song, gives me so much Arcane vibes! I am ready!!
看來是個非常政確的英雄
3:10 She kinda looked like Viego there, sitting on a throne with a blade
Death of the lamb, birth of the wolf
BTS collaboration with LoL ?! oh.. wait...
BUENÍSIMO, MUCHO MEJOR QUE EL FRAGMENTO DE KAYLE Y MORGANA EN LA ÚLTIMA CINEMÁTICA. :3
Let's be honest. This is THE world song, Heavy is the crown is just teaser for it.
❤😊
ㅋㅋㅋ게임 캐릭터보댜 서사없는 월즈 뮤비 ㄹㅈㄷ 진짜 개열받네 페이커 없으면 이 인기 유지하지도 못하고 리그 개 축소될 꺼 뻔한데 뮤비를 그따구로 만들어놓고 이건 또 왜 이런 퀄리티야 하 미친 으 짜증나 으으ㅡ으ㅡ 티원 서사를 그렇게 날려먹어? 참내. 게임 캐릭터가 더 중요한가벼 으으 라이엇 이 망할 놈들
Same song every year... Doesn't sound unique at all
Woo Esther Dean was a writer! Love her (she was in the Pitch Perfect movies and writes a lot of music).
That woman is high before her death.
Мурашки по коже
as per usual a big yawn of a song
Just a masterpiece.
is that a Salvador Dali reference??
Is that supposed to be Ambessa Medarda ? Video clip much better than world 2024 btw
Is she Kindred ?
better than 2024 worlds mv
Riot and Music best duo DONT STOP
Whoever seeking peace by starting wars, will shatter the worlds including theirs.
This is the lady Jinx just pissed off?
Seems like the overarching theme is sacrifice. On top of all the league lore that others have mentioned. The lamb not only being kindred but also symbolic of the sacrificial lamb metaphor and being what ambessa had to sacrifice for her vision of being on the throne. Also 0:55 has to be black rose related. The bit of fragmented wall framing kindred looks like an abstracted or low-poly rose shape from a top view but also in half to create a cave* entry like shape, and knowing fortiches style, i'd say alot of though went into framing this shot. This is so cool.
Riot the musical
Riot delivers again!
Mephisto, is it you?
잘 만들면서!
I thought this is BTS song 😅
욕 처 먹어서 다시 만들었니?
Some Dali vibes in the clip btw
The singer voice sounds like ambessa
Arcane 2 gonna be crazy
I don't want to listen this fckign BTS song!!!
waiiiit she's pregnant !!!! ?
Jesus has payed the price for us all, His sacrifice alone has atoned for our sins. Turn to Him and accept His grace before its too late.
Супер! Что Пантеон забыл в Ноксусе?
Would be a cool cinematic without the music
lit
Everytime Riot is not involved with K-pop bands, they can produce real good music
Pantheon having a side hussle as noxians sparring partner to check if someone is worthy of a second chance is wild.
I noticed that right after the fetus shot, the scene where ambessa wakes up the soil around her is glowing red that slowly fades away. ambessa get rid of the arrow in her stomach. It looks like the soil around her has a mark of the "Lambs respite" the kindred's ult ingame? Im sure that getting hit an arrow and and falling to the ground doesn't make that kind of mark.
내 마지막 춤을 다 가져가아아아아아아아아아 가아아아아아아아
They need to stop making these fantastic music videos just for a while and make more Tv series but based in different regions in that bizarre and wonderful universe. 😊
Vtalv que buen video nms
The lord is amazing but Ambessa is broken lmao.
wait i think her daughter is the one from arcane the one jayce sleept with
피땀눈물??
ITS SO GOOD
Hold up, is that Kindred I'm seeing? Riot recognizing them more lately and I'm super here for it
wait was she pregnant?
Wjshegwuqo
im suprised the comments are friendly in league videos unlike in game,wish it was the same for game
j zạy
Трек мощный, очень понравился. Ну и Пантеон с Киндред (такой скин себе прикуплю) . Ну а остальное.. На любителя🤷‍♂️
Better than Worlds mv
new dungeon trailer???
nice visuals, loved the drum ppl looked cool af. so what is the deal with her siting like  veigo on the throne, and so that's kata and swain who is the panth looking guy and why i dont see daruis, and i hate the fact that kindred is everywhere now, like ya i know she was on the brink of death but it was not her time so she should not see kindred unlike trynda and yass it was their time to die but trynda just said no and yas accepted it .
I really do not want to see any more joggers. Media is meant as an escape, adding more joggers defeats the purpose.
페이커 뮤비나 돌려놔
2025???
Degenerate Community, to brainwashed to recognize, goodluck.
Meanwhile Zilean: 💀
Мои сны при температуре 37.1:
They seriously need to cool it with these sick visuals I’m DYING HERE
So hype to see this be sing at the world final
I'm so happy to see more stuff like this coming out!! It's so good :D

useless diversity hire champion. riot games is  G A R B A G E
I think the chosen of the wolf are people in lore who almost died but fought for their lives for a second chance(Pantheon almost dying to Aatrox, Swain almost dying to Irelia. Idk about katarina tho) so now Ambessa have to fight them to prove that she is deserving of a second chance.
Well... Por leer "Blood, Sweat & Tears" se me vino a la mente la canción de BTS XD
Finally we have the S14 anthem. It's so late this year. Can't wait to see it being performed on the final stage!
Когда киндред были рядом с триндамиром и он сражался со своей смертью - было круто. Потому что он по геймплею бессмертен (почти). Теперь они и ноунеймов проверяют. Мда
쩐다..
Okay, but like, young Ambessa is pretty hot lol
"내 피땀눈물"
When it went full screen and back to this 3:39    I SWEAR IT FELT LIKE I WAS WATCHING A MOVIE ON IMAX 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥  Also No way this is gonna be the animation for Arcane, It’s looks way too realistically beautiful, This is a Massive compared to Season 1’s animation 😱😱😱😱
FAKER YOU ARE LEGEND 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man! Riot with their animation is freakin awesome!
on repeat 🔁
osea el lobo que venia era en reaidad kindred ? pense que era un lobo real
at 3:14 probably thats ambessa innocent side go fade away and screaming "why" and turn into heart of the wolf
The yellow eyes remind me of Rell. The clockwork lamb reminds me of Mel.  The one to fear, and the one lost. This music tells a great story of life, death, and character
I see so many negativity in this video
🗣📢SO PEAKKKKK!!!
피 땀 눈물 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
The local cuisine is in my balls Ambessa.
sublime UwU
i love it
So in a four minute video, they give Ambessa more development than most modern females characters get in series that span for years....
Disgusting
ah this is a song about ambessa
what the, just found this from listening to rise
and then ML content creators will use this audio for their Content 🤣🤣🤣
Waiting so patiently for an epic wolf fight and after all that the wolf was like “she seems like she’s really going through some stuff right now. Best I leave her alone.”  Still great. Still loved it. Please consider incorporating more wolf fights into future music videos thank you
GOAT
I'm so bad at art I don't understand anything but apparently it's so deep stuff so nice
I love how the visual metaphors can have multiple interpretations! Her carrying and then sacrificing the lamb could be seen as her giving up the last of her innocence after being hardened by war, in order to become the wolf and save herself. Or it could be her literally carrying the innocent child in her womb through the horrors of the world. Also not to mention the switch from white clothing to black, resembling the transition from lamb to wolf, (Kindred).
para quem não entedeu a ovelha deixou ela viva e seu bebe só pra caçar aqueles como o trynda que desafiam o lobo, ja que ela foi a primeira que desafiou a ovelha
мне одному кажется что это полная х4йня?
섹시한 늑대 영상을 보여줄줄 알았는데
My feelings on Ambessa prior to this were sort of "meh". NOW I am about to be real sad she is definitely a villain in Arcane season 2.
ah so Mel has powers.
WHAT'S MRS HOWARD DOIN HERE?!?
I don't think its a coincidence that the warrior Ambessa faces is Pantheon who's most notable feat is dying so hard the God was erased but Atreus had such a strong will he survived.
Also I like the chaotic segments at the chorus drop like   What do i even say bro they did well
7 PALABRAS ESENCIA
If Arcane was a musical. This would be Ambessa's villain song.
Nae pi ttam nunmul ~
My theory might be stupid but I think Ambessa here is on the foot of Mount Targon (I just want to push the Pantheon narrative really lol). At 3:50, you can see that on the ground there was an impact and she probably fell from the sky. At 3:53, right side, there seems to be a Targonian weapon sticking on one soldier. Might be that the baby/ Mel was also chosen to become an ascended or it was Ambessa herself (but it's most likely Mel since she seems to be powerful). Might be that they tried to climb Mount Targon but other Noxians ambushed them for whatever reason.
Who is the child?
Pregnant woman in NOXUS army, RIOT are you ok?
You know I think it'd be cool to believe that while fighting off death, and winning, her child got to live as well. Figting for more than one person. But  having to give up alot to ensure that happened.  I mean that's probably super obvious but yea kinda cool  Also don't bully me i am an arcane watcher i do not play league
ngl I half expected a BTS collab based on the title 😂
I can use the song on youtube ? ( copyright )
Maan, that song's a banger... @jonathanymusic you don't seem to be doing covers lately, but I immediately thought I'd love hearing you singing it as well
THE SHERYL LEE RALPH IS SINGING WHAT IM SO HAPPY
Much love to the singer this is beautiful
If this really is how the noxians view kindred, i love how gnarled and emaciated lamb looks since a majority of them would rather challenge wolf than accept her mercy
Idk Riot, but the lyrics ain't it. 😐
this is the probably one of the worst song i have ever heard some of yall need to build into ears
on god id rather listen to flight reacts
never drop a song again
What if the magic of Mel, the fetus, saved Embessa there?
me wondering why kindred didn't come for Embessa
Looks like two parallel story lines taking place across 3 different locations. Somehow Kindred brought her to a Noxian gladiator pit trial on Mt. Targon in a vision about a fight in Shurima.
It took me WAY too long to associate the wolf and lamb with Kindred.
At 3:15 the face paint might actual be a reference to the colours of the trans flag and mrak ambessa's transformation in her battle with death
more character development than modern day movies with a bunch of ''strong girl mary sues'' .. this one shows struggle , development , pain , strength .. emotional while still maintaining femininity .. all in 4 minutes .. while some movies cant do that over whole franchises
2:32 Ketheric Thorm, Lord Gortash and Orin vibes
Musick and video  10/10 game 3/10
Riot trolando como sempre... E a história das runas??? Nunca mais explicou a continuação dessa poha! Ryze passou por todas história de Rubeterra atoa :/
TOO MUCH WOKEAGE
Где моя киндред сука
Mel was adopted, Ambessa literally asks her if she wants to be her daughter in the season 1 flashback. She is more than likely pregnant with her son Kino.
I demand Riot release a music video with every new champ. You're doing us a disservice if you don't.
The one dying isn't Medarda, it's her baby.
Great song! Definitely going on repeat for a while!
Love how it ended with her ripping out the arrow and bleeding to death.
Americans/english people try not to mention Necrit at every godamn video challenge: impossible.
incroyable
Riot always manages to give me goosebumps with these trailers.
James Bond Soundtrack Vibes tbh
Very nice video. Where's Linkin Park?
Worlds theme we deserved
Amazing song and lyrics, but the animation is just pure gold!
God the animation is incredible
Ambessa, todavía no sales pero ya te quiero mucho, lol siempre haciéndome enchinar la piel con canciones demasiado épicas y motivadoras
Nice
less blacks more other races.
"A wolf has no mercy."
Idk why but seeing her pull out the arrow out of her body tilts me a little lol
i believe the baby is kino. im not entirely sure but isnt mel adopted basically?? in arcane season 1 ambessa told her 'you could be my daughter'. or did i misunderstand?
A lowly Tarnished became Elden Lord 3:05
Modern work of Salvador Dali? Anyone?
Cool video. But smell of big DEI rigth there.
valeime to toda arrepiada
очередной сильный и независимый сникерс
The way she fights for her life when we see a child in the womb. Holy sh!t, I got chills. She's going to be an absolute menace in Arcane. She loves that girl more than anything. A mother's rage is one thing. But HER motherly rage is going to be next level.
Reborn in the 19th thunder :) 4:06
Yeah this may be a banger but it aint gonna make her any less 200 years giga cancer ingame
This has to be AI...Riot is way better than this.
Trash
ya intervivo disney en RIOT tambien?
She's much cooler without her golden armor haha
The black wolf is also a represtation of "the black dog" an image people usually see as a warning that death is close. Popularized by truckers staying up too late driving
The imagery here is surreal.
this is so much better than arcane season 1
Indie music company
N in paris
is arcane s2 a musical
They really made a music video for a skinline thats crazy
apenas uma palavra. Bizarro.
AND THE FACT THAT SHES PREGNANT DURING ALL OF THIS??????? HELLO?????
why black female tho
Kindreds part in this sold it for me tbh
And here I am hoping it would be a Mystery Skulls music video... What a shame... xd
crazy work <3
I prefer this as Worlds song than Linkin Park
Winston approves.
No lo voy a negar lo único bueno q saca riot son sus animaciones y canciones ahí se ve le meten mucho empeño a su juego nada q ver
looking forward to the Osu! beatmap
Oh.. NUH HUHHH I ain’t coming baaaack
I need riot to become a studio company. And not a gaming company. Because the music department and animation department are both so incredibly amazing. The story designers and lore is unmatched. Riot has some incredable skills working for them. So let there skills show in the forms of series like Arcane and music vids like this and many other previous videos.
Someone have the lyric, please
no entendi muy bien, pero esta re piola
katarinaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
as we fall but less inspired
Definitely worse than the greatest before it, but overal not bad at all.
Definitely worse than the greatest before it, but overal not bad at all.
We'll be 80 years old and I still think there will be a lot of lore left for us to see 🥲
OMGGGGG🤯 I LOVE ITTTTTT
Is... is her armor mirroring the NOXIAN version of Kindred?! For an Arcane character pulled into the game that's a LOOOOOT of lore to dump onto her. And I'm here for it
tudo do lol é bom, menos a partida rankeada
Sheryl Lee Ralph is from Abbott Elementary among other things! She killed this!
wow...
I wanna see Vi vs Ambessa. holy would that be epic.
is that a man or a women!??
Wow.... just wow
She fed. Lol
Kinda lame that you just release champions like this. Where's a new permanent map and game mode? Shurima? Ixtal? Ionia? Freljord? Zaun? Piltover?  None of them other than Freljord has a map and ARAM doesn't have any monsters on it. Its simply: Cross Bridge, Defeat Other Team, Destroy Nexus. As simple as it can get. Now make it more complex, like Rift, but not exactly the same thing. Use it as an opportunity to think outside the box. Something makes me think this will never be seen by anyone at Riot. But in the off chance someone does, Please, for the love of all things, please, make it fun again.
I hope Riot can put this much effort into every new champ, and ideally also get around to the old ones which could use some love
DEJEN DE PONER TANTOS NEGROS
beautiful imagery
Kled need buff riottttttttttt
Separated by the rift, united by their cinematics.   The league of legends community.
Mommy Medarda has lore now...the lamb definitely represents something major that she sacrificed
4:02 etretat ❤️
4 min with this ... Not less like 30min with Marvecc xD
Es buenísima
Man, any Kindred makes for a great day, but THIS Kindred? Hot dang.
Pantheon armor is so cool looking
Riot games deberia hacer Peliculas y deberia de darnos un MMORPG de una vez por todas !!!!!!
Remember ya'll if you get shot with an arrow, just pull it out.
Well Well Well
O Client uma merda, o jogo cada dia mais desbalanceado. Mas pra fazer filmezinho eles são bons!
juju
did they gender bender leona? are we starting doihng that on league too?
BIX NOOD MUHFUGGA
tanto peruano en la cinematica
Just as beautiful as Arcane. So amazing
Anyone else feel like shurima's version of the wolf mask kind of looks like anubis, very fitting
where's cc ?
Why do Ambessa arms look funny though in armor? Like its proportions... They look so short :o
Sadly another disappointment
HYPE in its essence. I guys know how to do this lol ❤
Good visuals, good vocals, but I still can't get over the bad music.
멋있다....
Getting a feeling Ambassa will get a bigger role and focus in season 2 than I expected.
?????
video de um grito soh
Please Riot, let me set my favorite profile Icons.. there are so many im getting lost in the list.
DEI team of Riot going wild on this one, does she identify herself as a SHE/HER or a THEY/THEM?
did nobody notice she is pregnant in the vid ??
Rewatching this masterpiece after Necrit's video, it hits very different now.
muy mal, nunca se arranca una flecha si no puedes cerrar la herida de inmediato para evitar morirse desangrado.
Tem alguma coisa qe não gostei no clipe, não sei bem dizer o que é
What a banger. I can feel that voice in my bones
Vocals are so good!
I love the music, but listening to it makes me wish that one day they pick Florence Welch to do a song, it would be iconic.
When will the client be in good condition?
Why did it take you so long to release the Worlds 2024 theme song?
pa cuadno el cliente en condiciones??????????????
are you sure this a lol cinemaitc beacuse ı couldnt see any peace of lol , if lol didn't send this, I dont bealive.
I can’t be the only one who noticed the circle around Ambessa at the end of the video. Is that not reminiscent of Kindred Ult? Am I trippin?
this is by far the dumbest video i think iv ever seen them do and the voice actress for ambessa does not in fact have a singing voice this was awful and the newer riot is actual trash xDD sell out more riot
Ban it every single game until u remove the passive
Ridiculously good genuinely cant stop rewatching it
WOW
не реалистично женщина на троне так и еще черная
как же похуй на слезы черных 2;24
Who is she??????????
looooove the song!!!
노래좋다
KINDRED IN ANOTHER CINEMATIC LET'S GOOOOOOOO!!! 🐺🐐
Mommy?
BANGER
she fought and lost, took a stone from kindred(?) and then became queen? thats the worst story of the game so far
Please have Sheryl sing this song somewhere live!
Still looking for that Linux support announcement
Se nota que el equipo de Fortiche y de Riot hicieron un excelente trabajo en el audiovisual, y la música está totalmente a la altura, mis felicitaciones 🎊💯🎉
PANTHEONNN
Remember that kindred had different appearances for every place in runeterra. Its the first time that they show how noxians see it
Meh. Too woke. Get woke, go broke.
Take notes Hollywood this is how you make a badass female character that doesnt feel forced.
this is a banger and i know bangers
Is this the mom from arcane?
I hate to say, IMO this is better than  worlds 2024 song
can't we have this guy instead he look baddass 1:22
The freaking tribal beat at 2:50 didn't need to make me ascend like that...
¿Kindred?
i think riot needs to fire the balance team and just starts making these beautiful animations and songs and stories
I'm just here to say that i wish,i really wish that they're going to perform this on this year's opening ceremony.
fix team building system
video ficou pica D+
3:36 is that mel? That would be so cool and it would make sense when she glowed up at the end of season 1
I can't convey how much I love this art,everything is just so perfect. the story, settings, color, theme, concept, transitions.. very unique and well thought out it's unlike any other animated videos I've seen.
imbalance
I don't even play the game but I come here every time they post something because of the music 🎶.
real question: did ambessa force herself on the battlefield pregnant, or did noxus say "we don't care if you're pregnant, do it for noxus!" like cmon, no maternity leave for noxians?  (poor mel, even before leaving the womb she was destined to be teeter death's door... W A I T was Kindred's Wolf form coming for ambessa or mel?!)
The babies eyes glowed gold like the person in the trailer! I wonder if that's baby Mel or her brother?
The Wolf and Lamb, Kindred References <3
Te comprendo ambessa
Skin=€€€€€€
Unfortunately, this won't make it any more balanced.
Kindred looks so badass in this trailer.  Im living for the Kindred representation lately in LoL.
THIS IS CINEMA!!!!!
Raro Pero súper pegajoso y muy buen video
Thought this was a Worlds promo...forgot that Worlds is only a promo for the game.
Man this is incredible
el lore: ME FUMO 50 PORROS Y NO SE Q PONER XDE
I love France so much (yes, it was made by the same French studio who made Arcane)
3:40 i feel like this sound refers to Still Here when Kindred fought with Tryndamere and i cant unhear that
Anyone else just confused?
Y riot despide al creador del campeon 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I don't wanna play her if she ain't got her mask. It's just too cool.
Les mecs sont trop forts j'ai pas les mots
Thats cool way to show how pantheon w works, just absolutely slams them to the ground
Who are those weird looking blue people?
Now this is how music video should me made. Great stuff.
4:02 The cliff view from the beach at the end, it is litteraly Les Falaises d'Etretat, France
와 진짜 지렸다....이게 유저들이 라이엇에 원하던 음악이고 영상이지. 진짜 일년의 마무리를 장식할 롤드컵 주제곡이라고 해도 모자람이 없을 정도. 투쟁의 삶에 대한 가사가 딱 선수들의 치열한 경쟁의 삶을 대변하는데 세계관, 암베사의 배경과도 찰떡이라 너무 좋아요.
AYO IS THIS A BTS REFERENCE???? BC YK EHE BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS? HAHA JK PLS GUYS DONT TAKE IT SERIUSLY
Dermo
Is it just me who has noticed the EXTREMITY of hard push of black females across all media in recent years? It is insane! ... As if it is by mandated decree of some higher power. Something tells me Ecko will barely show up in sn2 of Arcane.
Good song. Terrible video.
Uurgh!!!!
the song is KSI level bad but the video itself is incredibly good
Was she on an Ionian beach at the beginning there ?! She participated in the invasion ?!
I pet G.O.A.T. 3000 🤙🤙🤙🤙
la nueva kasanta xD
The lamb is her son. That’s why she’s holding him. The statue she sees when she cries is her son carrying the lamb. She’s offered a vision of a future in which she becomes the Chosen of the Wolf, but only if she let’s go (her death would mean her unborn son’s death too) and just when she has embraced that possibility her son’s heartbeat calls her back and she rejects the offer, choosing to live. In the end the wolf leaves because she’s chosen the lamb. What a beautiful production, ffs.
그녀가 얼마나 치열한 인생을 살았는지 보여주는 영상.... 이제 무한접대가 시작된다
This is pure art
3:31 you can see a child in a womb
finally, riot is back with their insane quality!
If I remember correctly, in Noxus no one believe in lamb side of Kindred, so I guess thats why even Lamb looks like Wolf and all warriors choosed by Wolf Side
KIINDREEEDDDDDDD AAAAAAAA
i never wanted a necrit video more than now
golden
I love the black representation! Well done for sure.
Kal
THIS is the kind of strong female character of colour I want to see on my television!
So i am guessing she is like female Black Panther but a wolf??
Loving that Kindred getting her/his attention finally. Loving this champ since release.
This is insanely good, I'm loving every second of it. Her voice is so powerful I'm getting chills.
We need a series like Arcane in Noxus
Assisti quando só tinham 81 k visualizações 👏🏾
Se ve y escucha muy bien, lo malo es que no entiendo que quiere expresar
Why does every cinematic kindred appearance hit so hardddd
RITO, I know your incomes should be around a thousands of bilions, but can you spend more than 0,05 USD on the actual product?
corporate and beats
This woman went to war THAT pregnant?!
ah yes, shyvana reskin.
hope this song will be played on worlds final
They did more work on the music video than the actual champ.
How dare you stand where they once stood :D
I need a loop of 3:11 moment, it's too good.
Video này thực sự khiến mình có thêm động lực để phấn đấu. Bạn đã làm rất tốt trong việc truyền cảm hứng cho người xem, cảm ơn bạn!
Could have been the worlds song tbh. Miles ahead of Heavy is the Crown in my humble opinion.
halle berry?
Where is aatrox bro
린킨파크는 어디있나요?
god i love this song, getting a bit of a danzig vibe on the chorus
ㅆㅂ t1월즈 뮤비를 이렇게 만들어라 좀
If you wanna come play, you gotta start with me and the monsters in my head
3:10 viego sword?
Who sang this?
Meu deus... oque foi isso Krl que obrs de arte
0:45 naafari?
0:45 naafari?
League of Wokeness lmao
And now riot metaphors human sacrifice too??? Stop playing this trash game, guys.
와 롤 노래중에 최고다 개미쳤네
Another Fortiche's masterpiece. 👍
Wolf came to give her a chase
Why did you make that Worlds MV when you could make it like this?
wow
Loving the mix of Shuriman and Noxian depictions of Kindred / Beliefs about Death
Is this even league?
Also riot please make a movie.  For the love of god please make a movie!
BTS의 피땀 눈물이 더 낫다 ㅋㅋ
Riot just continues to make hit after hit after hit. THEY DON’T MISS!
WAIT is she in france ? like the cliff of Etreta ?
OK, OK... Just don't make us waiting 9 years like you did with "Get Jinxed"
Kindred has been getting so much love by the riot music team recently
THATS MEL!!! The fetus who's eyes glowed must be mel! She had that golden glow aswell! YALL THIS IS WILD
what the worlds theme should have been
Booooo
ㅋㅋ이딴거 만들시간에 롤드컵뮤직비디오나 신경 좀 쓰지 어휴
This is my favorite BTS song! <3 Really loved Jimins Part.
솔직히 이거 만들 시간 좀 더 써서 티원 헌정 뮤비 재수정 했더라면... 하는 티원팬이라면 개추
ale sraka
월즈 뮤비를 좀 이렇게....
1:52 That's like the eternal question of who comes first, the egg or the chicken, but here it would be who comes first, the song or the video?
무슨 파리 올림픽 개막식 같냐 ㅋㅋ
2:45 so thats how noxians see kindred?
Better than Linkin Park
ainda estou confusa sobre o passado dela, espero ter mais informações em arcane.
is it me or is the mountains in the ending the same mountains in the beginning of RISE?
So, this is real Worlds song?
А причем тут киндред???  Типа проводник между смертью и жизнью??
"Awaken" a última cinematic de lol que prestou..
😶‍🌫️
У меня мурашки
내 피땀 눈물~
Damm, are those dancers, drummers and choir from Xerath's music company?
IT IS NOT KINDRED !! i need to say it for ppl not knowing but Kindred is the god of death for certain part of Runeterra there is others god of death for other parts of runeterra and this is one of them
저번에는 아시아 인종차별 뮤직비디오 만들더니 이건 드럽게 잘만들었네 ㅋㅋ
1 hour necrit video incoming
3:47, you need to break the arrow. If you pull it out you will bleed to death.
what a fall from grace. 2/10
Hey look! It's the new perma ban champion.
Музыка крутая, картинка красивая
Muito daora ela dançando arrocha 3:02
Сон дохлой собаки
Meh, song was kinda mid. Just a bunch of overused cliche's thrown together. They just hyping up their new overtuned champ release. Cool backround story arc for sure though. Video while visually appealing, was too appealing. Made the champs look more high tech than they are. Idk...not feelin this one like all the other songs. Worst one by far imo.
Đổi bài này thành bài hát của chung kết thế giới đi
o lobo empurro um filhote nela
Thanks to BTS the song is poppin
Welcome to Dash of Legends!
where is jimin?
Cringe, like everything else on arcane
KIndred, the symbol of death throughout whole Runeterra, gets their appearance second time current year, amazing.
Even the creators themselves fail to grasp the mastery of their work
NECRIT I NEED U NOW!!!!
About that arrow, I dont think she would able to call for an ambulance with her cell phone from this medieval battlefield, as some people suggest, nor break that arrow which is made of iron with her hands...
Necrit fanservice
trashhh
Separated by the rift, united by their cinematics.   The league of legends community.
그래서 이건 누구 컴백곡임?ㅋ
Fortiche again!!
YOO ANDRE HAZES WHERE YOU AT
3:04 Lil NAS x
Wow! No words
i don't think the lamb represents "the lamb within her". i think it is representing her child, because she is pregnant on the battlefield
Just watched it..... wtf is this racist blasphemopus shiet?? Crazy XD
3:38 Baby Mel Medarda
Couldn't have done this for Faker?
This clip is freaking insane, I would love to see more of these background lores in longer formats Arcanae-style
LoL is funny. The try hard of the entire community is crazy xD
Don't know what's going on but this is intense.
이렇게 만들 수 있으면서 왜 월즈 뮤비 는 그 지랄로 만들어 버린 거야 라이엇
I thought it's BTS when i first saw it💀💀
very cool but shes permaban.
월드 뮤비를 그따구로 만들고 이건 열심히 했네.. ㅡㅡ
good very good
Бля, как же это ахуенно❤❤❤
Oh god, I see a Kata skin…I’ll have to start playing again. 😢
Best trailer for worst champion of the times
Am i only thinking that Ambessa got a promise from kindred that she will dont die in a fight? "I was rised by wolfs", so wolf won't kill her?
wounded, bleeding. yeah she is gonna end up on the rift fighting minions, and towers. Ah yeah my summoners rift and its traumatic women
Ambessa still wasn't on Atreus levels to beat Pantheon in a fight.
sup
i hate this character cant wait for her nerfs
Same animation as Arcane.  Noxus series confirmed 👌
Stop the woke bs
Вспонила её слова из сериала: ,,Есть только два типа людей: люди-овцы и люди-волки, к кому же относишься ты?,, Омг так Медарда была изначально относилась к людям-овцам, беспомощьным, запуганным мученикам. Какой шикарный клип. Через кровь, пот и слёзы стала другой. Хищником. Волком.
WAAAAİT PANTHEONNN??? 💀💀💀💀 FİNALYY 😭😭😳😳
panth and kindred looking nice, the rest is cringe, hate is welcome
오 좋네요. 그런데 페이커 헌정 무비는 언제 나오나요?
No BS. A powerful woman and not a feminist. A female that embraces her inability to face struggles and was able to stand, alone. This is a WOMAN POWER!
У меня что-то с динамиком или мне кажется?
이렇게 잘 할수있으면서 왜 티원은 .. 왜... 어째서
really fitting song and video for recent crazed black that got gunned down
all Riot songs sound the same
야이 시 발 라이엇아 t1 롤드컵 뮤비는 그따구로 해놓고 이게 맞냐? 이거 만들라고 페이커 4번째 우승 기념 뮤비개같이 만든거냐?
Africa 👎
WHY ON THE EARTH DID YOU GUYZ JUST GRINDED 2024 WORLDS THEME, THOUGH U CAN MAKE THIS QUALITY
The guys in Fortiche are just too good
Infinite times better than KSI's
like how they actually take the kindred as the symbol of fighting the edge of dead to survice
It is not advisable to pull out an arrow or any stabbing object from the wound for fear of inducing severe bleeding. Leave it intact until you are at a place where you can receive professional medical help.
Why is katarina beside Swain?
did you copy BTS' song tilte???
用腳做遊戲，用心做動畫
trash
This is better than Worlds 2024 anthem
Blizzard take notes!
In Christianity, the lamb represents Christ as both suffering and triumphant; it is typically a sacrificial animal, and may also symbolize gentleness, innocence, and purity. When depicted with the LION, the pair can mean a state of paradise. In addition, the lamb symbolizes sweetness, forgiveness and meekness. i give food for necrit
A wolf in sheep’s clothing
The abs😋
the fight feels like the gulag u just need to win, to escape death
N
New champ? 5 passives? 40 dashes?
Better than the Linkin Park one which just felt like a LInkin Park promo.
뮤비때깔바라.....이건 지들이 만들었나보네
man its just 20 hours and this alrady grown on me ! LOL
I need a necrit video stat!
at 1:57 she kinda looks like sevika in the reflection
It's funny knowing Ambessa survived an encounter with Kindred and went on to call herself a follower of Wolf and in Arcane she hires the services of an Escort who wears the mask of Lamb.
I thought it was bts 😭😭
amazing song but you cant make us like ambessa
Jayce unborn child?
Will Ambessa become next host for Pantheon!? A new Aspect of War, reincarnated after Aatrox killed it? Because thats what this seems to imply to me seeing the deal she seems to make with Kindred, and how she receives a set of armour of the same aesthetic as Pantheon...
It's a very cool video, but voiсe - terrible
srsly, Katarinaaa
롤챔스 뮤비가 이렇게 나왔어야 하는거 아니냐
Did the song is out on the streaming's platforms ? Like Spotify ?
2:43 kindred?
this year dear riot two videos two flops keep it up 👍🏻
abs!!!!! yesss!!!
so bd
Staff: Oof finally finished animating the second season of Arcane now I can go and see my family at last after 6 months Riot: Hold on now...
I have watched this video more than 30 times, the music and visuals are extravagant
Amazing song btw❤❤❤
J'ignorais que Noxus avait tenté de débarquer à Étretat. I didn't know Noxus tried to land at Etretat.
Am I only one who actually doesn't get it? Musick is cool but have nothing with video in this clip.
It's actually a bad idea to remove an arrow without getting medical help afterwards cause the arrow prevents further bleeding.
Ok, red, black gold, go from bottom to the top, Worlds team and Acrane teams got the wrong description with each others
That may just be what I need to Bes!  Because Ambessing!  Ambessing!
this goes hard.
This is my worlds anthem for this year
Eeeeehm so this is why they had to save on the budget of her walking animation in game and copy that of shyvana
It's true 2024 world theme
이렇게 만들 수 있으면서 린킨파크 헌정곡 만든거? ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
So where is her mask in game, Riot?
This might be the coolest music video riot has ever done. The visuals of the blue screaming people were so cool
i want cinematic but it's also great lol
3:42 is that Wolf walking away?
신챔 뮤비는 이렇게 잘 만들줄 알면서 T1한테는 왜그랬냐....
Great tune, very arcane. Though it's not going to catch on like imagine dragons tune. There's so much to the universe, it's a shame it's ending. I don't care for league of legends, put the show is incredible. I'm going to miss it.
롤드컵 뮤비인력 여기 다 들어갔구나 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
I love watching these so much because they are always amazing! ...however I have no context. I understand some just from obvious symbolism but I don't know the characters or what's *really* going on....can someone give it to me in a nutshell?
fireeee
Super crazy good mv. Won’t be appreciated enough sadly
I couldnt understand anything, can anyone explain anything?
Better than last 5 years worlds
이거 만든다고 월드컵 곡은 린킨파크거 샀나보네
3:11 waiiit,is that bork?
T1 노래부터 새로 만드시라구요~~~~ 증말 짜증나네
Aint no way Arcane isn't out yet I'm so hyped
Perfect ❤❤❤❤
Now im impressed. Finally
2024 롤드컵 노래 보다 이게 더 낫다 ㅋㅋ
Is Ambessa pregnant with Kino or Mel?
I liek this song more then the lol anthem. XD Its more cooler and make more sence
7 palabras E S E N C I A
Another treasure trove for Necrit lore.
왜 월즈 뮤비는 그따구로 만들고 ;; 이렇게 잘 만들 수 있으면서
무슨 롤드컵 뮤비보다 잘뽑았냐
so the wolf gave her delusions then pulled the arrow then stood up?
Trash
АААААА, ЖЕНЩИНА, ЧЕРНАЯ!!!
Man, wolf really put this girl through one helluva psychedelic trip 😂 lamb didn't even try and intervene
I just realised that the kindred turning from wolf at the start to the lamb at the end is meant to say that she gave up
omhg i love it p[laes emake more im 12 btw
This music company have pretty good music videos
Fix your game
PC again?
👎
6 ноября 202(5) ГОДА ?  а ну ок год подождать )
After watching it like 10 times now, i noticed the rage coming from this song. Something awakens inside of be by hearing this. I am so curious about ambessas story now. She is such a strong woman, who took a path to safe her daughter and the line "bc you weakend me" has now a way deeper meaning.
oh this has 007 movie intro vibes amazing.
Is nobody gonna mention the nice video duration
Lol, I knew that percussion was Woodkid the moment I heard it, had to check the credits and sure enough, he's in there.
better than the 2024 world anthem HAPPY AS A CLOWN
More human?
Someone tag those SBI , DEI , Ubisuck to learn how Rito cook a real black character that eveybody love to play :v
Нужно больше чернокожих женщин ! Тогда будет меньше потерь на войне.
뭔 내용인지 모르겠네.
Why am I crying..
Riot pls fix your game first. Don't spend the budget on music vidio. I'm still waiting for client fix        PS : the music is cool  PSS : the champ is cringe
i thought it was na pittam nunmul
This is my new gym song btw
Эх, субтитры зажопили А стрелу из себя лучше не вытаскивать, это приводит к кровотечению
|I cant help it. It looks kinda like Destiny XD I dont know why it remineds me of this. Srry it there is something incorrect.
Gotta appreciate the reference to Étretat cliff at the end ❤ 3:57
RIOT entertainment 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Came by curiosity. Stayed for the Animations!  Goodlord Fortiche! That's so beautifull!
bro the animation is just insane
black again
WE WANT CUSTOM ANNOUNCERS AND TAUNT JUST LIKE IN HON
Imagine getting hit by an arrow when you have 26 dashes in 30seconds, skill issue tbh
Broooo. Riot chilll . U need to make a world tour concert
this is garbage its like a music concert but animated so its 10x worse
i thougt is BTS song😂
yall remember season 13 trailer lmao
2:07 masterpiece...
So deep die Lore und ein Buffet für Augen und Ohren. Ein absolutes Fest. Gut gemacht Riot, da kann man die Fortsetzung von Arcane kaum erwarten.
Why's a champion MV's animation better than a Worlds MV's animation, huh Riot?
cool MV, now please delete sett and whatver that new champ is.
lmao bts is back
롤드컵 뮤비나 제대로 만들지 외주 맡겨서 그렇게 박은거냐?
월즈 테마를 이정도 퀄리티로 뽑았으면 얼마나 좋아…
피땀눈물ㅋㅋ
영상미 봐, 포티셰일줄 알았다니까.
Love the visuals, but cant say the same about the song :(
🔥
Hermoso! Gracias
어떻게 제목이 피땀눈물 ㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋ
할줄 아는 새끼들이었어
this really gives me goosebumps oof
3:26 is that my 🥷 SWAIN?!?!
Look at that championship MV that disrespected Faker... and then look at this high-quality MV. I genuinely can't stand seeing Faker being treated like that.
Tuyệt đối điện ảnh, perfect
Hands down. This would've been 10/10 a greater worlds song
✨legendry ✨
💘 Rút ngược một cách nhanh gọn thì nó là như vậy 😂
what is this
T1이 주최인 월즈 영상은 언제나오나요??
So is this the Worlds MV?
So many n@ggers champs... dis
omg theres kindred and pantheon!!
Me encanta todo lo de Riot pero casi me duermo
dont remove arrows, you might bleed out
할 수 있으면서 이것들이?
i need cc
Bạn thật tài ba, điều này thật quá sức ấn tượng!
Nice !
Absolutely cinematic 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
crazy world building for her to be visited by kindred on a battle field.
롤드컵 뮤비를 이렇게 만들었어야지 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
co to za wysryw?
hasta el video esta roto
They going for the Emmys, the Oscars and the Grammys. MAKE MY WORDS
Riot dropping the hardest mv/cinematic out of nowhere.  We need the fire fighters there's a fire over here.🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ive been melded by 200 Years of exzellence.  Im modest, loveable and fair. The Rift will be another place when i arive.  GG Rito
yikes
They hired Salvador Dali for this.
I was literally in a constant state of chills through this entire video. That was amazing
So here’s the reason for Swain mini rework…
this is so beautiful, I gotta make art of this
Just a first aid PSA if you get shot with an arrow try not to pull it out because of puncture wound would bleed you without stuffing the puncture wound tightly with gauze
Ну что ребята ждём новую колекцию скинов "золотые волки" 😀
Welcome back, Riot.
OMG! SOOO HYPE!!
200 years Ambessa
Better than this year’s Worlds MV
She's holding a lamb and got chosen by wolf hmm seems kindred to me
Every time someone likes this, I'll check out a hidden detail
Quería la canción de BTS
페이커에 대한 헌정 영상도 이 회사가 맡았어야 했다.
GODAMNN so touching, it's been quite a long time without an animation of this weight and concept. Thanks Riot, absolutely perfect
Blacks in League Lucian: got gun with dash／Senna: got gun with sneak／Nilah: dash, gather people and whip them Ekko: dash, hit & run ult／Pyko: dash, sneak and rob money ult／K'sante: dash and kidnapping ult Ambessa: dashes & slashes like an ADHD
DEI done right
Lamb: Wolf stop Wolf: Why little lamb? Her time is come. Lamb: I know Wolf but not her's (the baby)
슈리마여 진격하라
LoL is dead, after they discontinued the migration from garena
It turns out the budget for the World Championship MV is only this much, so I understand why the World Championship MV is somewhat disappointing
Way better than Heavy is the Crown
this song on the worlds final plz
Another fire song? Lets find out   Say what you want about Riot The cinematics and music they release for league is almost alwats top tier quality
노래 좋당
this was so good wtf good one riot, you have outdone yourselves, again!
롤드컵 mv도 좀 시네마틱 제작진일아 합치면안됨?? 진짜 퀄리티가 다른데요
Обожаю песни которые пишутся для Лиги легенд и Аркейна особенно для 2 сезона!!!!! Потрясающая песня!!!!
cringe
Амбесса в молодости ваууу во втором сезоне она ключевая персона
3:10 We got an African female Viego now lmao
이 뮤비 정성에 반만이라도 월즈뮤비 만드는데 좀 쓰지 그랬냐...
THIS IS BETTER THAN CHAMPIONSHIP MUSIC
no puedo dejar de repetir el 2:49 es que la musica queda demasiado perfecta con la animacion FUAAAA te hace latir 😋
이새끼들 아케인에는 존나 공들이고 월즈 뮤비 개떡으로 만든거보소 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
KATARINA HERE WE GOOOOO
Cheesball song...
The more I see these videos, the more I get invested into the story of each and every character. Won’t play LOL though but the arcs are amazing and inspiring in my own journey, Thank you LOL for inspiring me
Terrible and pandering as usual
I'm fascinated by the depth of discussion within the League of Legends community surrounding the lore of Runeterra. The collective passion and insight of fans bring rich layers of understanding to the complex world-building and narrative that underpin the game. Riot Games would do well to tap into this intellectual fervor, as the comments section is a treasure trove of innovative ideas and thoughtful analysis.
Fea música.
In lore, the kindred (wolf in this case) is only visible to someone dead or dying, and they always kill their target. The fact that Ambessa saw the wolf and it didn't take her life means that the wolf wasn't there for her but instead it was for her child.   The lamb could symbolize the way Ambessa is protecting the child from the spirits of death, keeping it's innocence. Since it's the wolf Ambessa needs to fight to prove her worth, in the end the child still dies, but The Kindred acknowledges their struggle and grants Ambessa some kind of clarity (or some kind of power) symbolized by the Wolfhead Heart given towards the end of the video.   Top notch lore faithfulness and storytelling from these guys, Riot never misses.
Barbra from Abbott Elementary got VOCALS
Fe-li-na
Hotttttttttttttttttttt af
RAISED BY WOLVES???? EFFIE??!???
How many times have you watched this???  Me: Yes
Sheryl Lee Ralph! 💖 Absolutely aced this performance and I can't stop rewatching to hear her incredible vocals especially when paired with Fortiche's stunning animation. Thank you to everyone involved. The art is breathtaking. 💖
The wolf has the same scars as Ambessa does
The first time I saw it I thought it was a BTS song
矢を抜いたということは安らかな死を拒絶したという事か
Slay queen
Хуже и хуже
IS SHE PREGNANT
BRO IS AMBESSA PREGNANT?
me timaron, pensé que era de bts
2:36 favorite part
월즈 곡이나 이렇게 뽑고 뮤비 만들었어야지
월즈 뮤비 예산 아껴서 여따썼네
Diversed strong and independent woman done right man i'm convinced that those film makers are so out of touch that people who make games are better at telling complexstories
월즈도 이렇게 만들지 ^^
360 no scope no feto
Gawd deym Thos ABS! 😱
Ambessa was pregnant during this time. DAYM the light from the childs eyes saved her. The lamb she was carrying put all the meaning to something she desperately wanted to protect.
ksi new drop🔥🔥🔥💯
저거 킨드스킨으로 내주면 안되나..
kinda cringe and some parts are cool. they really should change their pacing, its pretty much either the same or similar structure to other videos and i find it extremely cringe when i see it. its like every marvel trailer.
I can’t wait for the iTunes release
So does this mean there's a possiblity that Mel survived based on this video? Say this dream is canon right? The baby's eyes light up. And especially with that champion leak with her image. Maybe there's hope for us after all, Jayce mains. Our girl might still come home.   Meanwhile Viktor: 💀 🤖 👾
와 몸매
ICONIC
( died in battle and sees the devil ( wolf ) Lifting a golden idol in the desert, seeing  a powerfull being in the skies seated on the throne, defeated his " angels " and killed the powerfull being, took his throne. Became  a god. Back in time and ressurected herself. Just like in avengers with thanos. No riot games, you and your pathetic satanic friend will not kill God itself and no, youll not become God.
I love how HUMAN this animation looks.
3:26 so ambessa enjoy a party with Pantheon, Swain and Katarina ?
So this is Ambessa’s story 😳
I'm already obssesed with this bro like what!!!!!!!!!!!!
으아아아 왕관 존나 무겁다
This is so amazing!!!
Yes 😈 and after all me again will be born again, agree seungsard
Save the people <3 stop wars.
Acceptance of death from the Wolf half of Kindred is pure badass. Kindred could sense her worthiness and spared her 0:38
Amazing story telling thanks RIOT!!!
Absolute Cinema🤚🤚
That's too much lore probably 3hrs necrit video incoming
This ambiance and culture of the environment is insane, I felt like I was in another world, I'm incredibly excited for Riot's next series
This. was. amazing!!!! The art, the music, the story, the action!! RIOT YOU DID GOOD!
I like that this one doesnt have half the music video with the band being animated like Lincoln Park
제목 직역하면 피 땀 눈물이네
Why is this song so much grander than the 2024 Worlds song
thats how you make music, thats how you create amazing character.
For those who say that Ambessa would finish Jinx off if she hurts Mel, remember that Jinx is no longer just a human, she is now a mutant with much more speed and endurance than a normal human, and she is a genius using Hextech-enhanced weaponry, no human warrior with only melee weapons can handle her now
Kindred appearence Arcane S2?
Noxus' Kindred has so much drip! Lamb is the DRINK.
Why dont have singers solo scene here and there?
This is epic
очередной шедевр, спасибо за вашу работу another masterpiece, thank you for your work
Where are the band members?  Can’t wait to see them in mv.
Alright then.. let's just non-casually make Ambessa the main character
Now i want to see skinlines the choosen of the lamb
Thanks Riot for giving us a preview to a song from the League of Legends: Broadway Musical.
Did you really want to trample and ruin the T1 MV, which shouldn't have been ruined, and then put some effort into the song that introduces the champion? lol😂
Trading the baby for her life? Accepting the offer from Kindred? Just a blast of a song as well? Gj riot I pardon you the kicking from ranked bc of vanguard this afternoon. No reports from me this time. Just a hypothesis but the characters in te video marked with red may have had some sort of pffer frome Kindred as well to avoid death.
Cringe over the top 😂 as always
Oh my gosh this is SO COOL MAN!!! It adds so much depth to Ambessa, I can't wait to see more of her in season 2
¿Porque este video dura 10 horas?
another soNgg
Necrit I am ready for the 50min video  Though this feels like one of those cinematic that he is gonna analyze and them come back in 2 months with another 50 min video and analyze again once we have the arcane season 2 context
아오시발꿈
I love Ambessa’s lore! The visuals and singing are so well done!!
So does this mean Ambessa becomes the aspect of Kindred the same way Leona and Diana are the aspects of the Moon and the Sun?
So it’s a skinline called “Chosen of the Wolf” which explains the Pantheon, Katerina and Swain appearances. Given the appearance of what *appears* to be Lamb that gives her a token, I’d assume it’s a universe where either only Wolf exists or one in which Wolf and Lamb oppose each other, given the blue cultists and the weird golden lamb thing.
이게 롤드컵 페이커 헌정곡이라는거죠?
lets count down until the nightcores drop
The real Worlds 2024 Music Video
Tbh, im so happy to see people hyping up pregnant (and very badass) woman like that
the only lore in here is she surviving and thats all, everything else is just not cannon, so stop making things about her
shout out to the kindred reference
Por la cara
Sheryl Lee Ralph 💙 Also those gold glowing eyes on the baby make me think its Mel not Kino because of her glowing Armor at the end of Arcane.
This is 120% DEI approved.❤
Desde el primer momento que vi a Ambessa en Arcane me gusto. Mujer, Negra y empoderada, pero de alguna forma no se siente un caso de inclusion forzada (lo cual detesto). Es simplemente un personaje muy bien logrado, es una Darius mujer. Va a ser epico destrozarla con mi Zed.
Это офигительно круто!!!!!🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
This looks absolutely ridiculous
Okay Necrit, I need you to explain this because I have no idea what's happening here. 1hr video is enough I think. HAHAAH
대충 꿈이였다는 얘기인가요?
Just noticed it's not just pantheon it's also katarina and swain will be in this skinline
Have a strong feeling that after Arcane whatever spin-off they have planned will be Noxus oriented
now THIS is fortiche
Sheryll Lee Ralph was the BEST person to sing this song. The strength she has her voice alone was chilling. So excited for the rest of the soundtrack
heavy is the crown to a queen... Ambessa...
Riot always exceeded every output they create.
I’m 20 seconds in and I can’t get over how STUNNING the animation is!! Fortiche really outdid themselves once again 🤩🙌💙💙
PLEASE TELL US YOU GAVE SEVIKA A BACKGROUND STORY TO!!
롤드컵 노래는 그렇게 남의 노래 빌려와서 의미없는 노래만들고 힘쌘 흑인할매 노래는 제대로 뽑은게 진짜 아니꼽네 🤬
Mami Ambessa❤️
A RIOT GAMES DEVERIA MUDAR O NOME PARA RIOT MOVIES
Another disappointment for me. from the theme song, the visuals... I miss the videos from years ago.
Pretty sure  you're not supposed to take out the arrows, knives, rebar etc. Because it helps stop the bleeding, only until there are medical professionals or in this case healing mages. Even though it kind looks cool, stupid but cool.
This makes me wonder if Mel actually has powers too. Something tells me, this season of Arcane is going to be even more of a jaw dropper than the first one.
Riot, lyrics in portuguese please... i'dont talk inglish
이렇게 만들줄 아는애들이 롤드컵 뮤비를 개판쳐놨어?
nah this is trash
meh
Riot Entertainment =))))
This is cool, all the characters in the gold with pantheon all had near death experiences. Katarina was almost killed by her brother Talon, Swain was almost killed and lost his arm during the Ionian-Noxian war by Irelia, and Pantheon almost died when Aatrox stabbed him in the chest. What’s also a cool detail is that I noticed all the red markings on these champions seem to indicate other, not as prominent, wounds they had that eventually healed.
Can't wait to perform this song by Mastercards on November 2
암베사가 원래 슈리마인인가? 그럼 ㅆ 분노로 하지
3:02 "calma calabreso, calma, calma calabreso 🙈👐" ksksksksksksks     Achei o vídeo paia...
1:24  판테온 너무 멋있다. 스킨 나오는건가?
“A wolf shows no mercy.”
1:18 looks like KSI's Thick of it 😂
It’s a better song than this year’s World Cup song
cuando vulven a sacar personajes masculinos con apariencia de hombre.. lo remplazan es una bestia , entonces o es  mujer con rasgos  masculinizado,. pongan rasgos nomales no los mezclen .
최악이고만 ㅋㅋ
That is the original Pantheon? He use his left hand on spear too
Huh so you can actually make good animation and good music huh?
???
This is awesome!
Estaba embarazada wow
WHAT A MASTERPIECEEEEEEEEE PLS SOMEONE GIVE RIOT A OSCAR FOR THIS
Always a freaking epic ride
no shot it's the new arcane opening right?
is that barbara from abbott elementary
암바사 저년은 챔프 출시도 전에 스킨 광고되노 ㅆㅂ
Please condemn the Communist Chinese Party as they take their citizens organs for religious beliefs
OMG KATA WE EATIN
Was she pregnant with her son or with her daughter?
갱플렝크 처럼 죽다 살아났나?
Ambesa is madara by arcane..
Wait a minute, they really got Sheryl Lee Ralph to sing! That's amazing
"Only one must die. Let her live and you may need to kill thousands."
Ambessa actually have a really great backstory , Riot Iconic Lore Vintage are back ?
Finally real music since arcane
이 뮤비에는 가수가 안나오네요?
피땀눈물~
Thank you so much again for that new Banger Riot games. You created durability. Goosebumbs are all over the place. The atmosphere is empowering. This piece of art creates so much hope in our vanes. Our bloodflow is pumping even stronger now. I feel so uplifted! That's what i needed! 💪🏽❤️😁
Lol animation is on another level😮
at this point just throw league and become a pure music company, because ur balance its pretty bad.
Ambessa is so op even Kindred was like forget that i am out..
pqp
já fez melhores
1:10-1:17 is peak animation, ngl.
OH MY GOD, LEAGUE JUST BECAME VARIATIONS 😳
Would
I love how at 2:35 Kindred looks hunched over like a Wolf and then stands up to take Lamb's iconic pose
Its been a long time Katarina!
Where is the new heavy is the crown mv?
A movie with this kind of animation would hit hard.....
Man those details and action ❤
you didn't know this but this is actually about the different aspects of my life, to the lamb, to broken bones, to battle scars, to the wolves 😡😡👿👿
Is that Kindred wolf 🤔
great song
Que le suban el sueldo a los animadores, que chulada de video!!!
cara... que clipe viajado, eu não entendi foi nada
i want the bts song
The Black and red kinda reminds me of gow 3 kratos
entendi nada, mas achei foda
Picture 10 ouf of 10 as always!)) Music also cool! Keep going!))
ㅈㄴ 별로다
오 헌정곡!

Ambessa is real fine but omg? am i the only one who didn’t know Sheryl Lee Ralph had PIPES
Es y siempre sera...CINE... ✋🗿🤚
Yeah I'm not gonna forgive Riot if Ambessa won that fight against my boi Atreus
insane
Put it on spotify pleasee:((
Curti não
LYRICS! 🖤❤️‍🔥  [Verse 1] I was raised by wolves I was born to lead And I starve 'til there's no more mouths to feed There's a hand on my throat And a blade at my feet But the weight of the world won't bend my knees  [Pre-Chorus] Broken bones, battle scars I have seen the bloodshed Carved in stone, when it's my sword They won't forget  [Chorus] No war, no peace 'til I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know  [Verse 2] I can use who I want And I taste what I please In this world I get all my fantasies There's a hand on my throat And a child at my feet But the weight of the world Won't bend my knees  [Chorus] No war, no peace 'til I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know  [Interlude] Don't wash away my blood Don't wash away my sweat It's all I know Don't wash away my tears  [Pre-Chorus] Don't wash my spirit, don't cleanse my soul Can't break my courage, and I won't fall ’Cause that's all I know  [Chorus] No war, no peace 'til I lead them all Leave me with my demons Hear my voice call No fears or sorrows underneath these bones Just blood, sweat, and tears Is all I know.
Niiiice! Love it
Почему везде появляется Киндред?
this is one of the best things ive ever seen
Too many questions but not many answers... The music was average but the cinematic was fricking awesome as always.
The animations, the storyline are all better than Heavy is the crown lmao
Wait was this a trip near dead or a story? 😅
she was pregnant
cool and all but why she pregnant and fighting in the ionian campaign ?
Parece Shurima onde a Taliyah aparece numa cinematic era onde aparece os bichos na areia.
내 피 땀 눈물 마지막 숨을
So basically she got that dog in her.
should have been worlds theme ....
Feels like a bond movie intro
Nhạc còn hay hơn bản CKTG 24 :)))
Barbara Howard from Abbott Elementary is the singer
Easily one of my top 3 favorite lol songs upon the first listen
The role of Lamb and Wolf across all forms of cultures and regions in Runeterra is just fascinating. I wish we get to explore them more in the future
At 3:58 why is she in France, normandy ?
nah riot you can't just release a broken champ then release an awesome mv and expect us to forgive
Eh. Missed the mark on this one riot 😢
3:25 future Beyonce cosplay
SSSSSSSSSSSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
ME VUELVO LOCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ME VUE,LVO LOCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA YO
LOL MMORPG when?
No entendí ni madr3s
Ela sacrificou o bebê?
BEST CINEMATIC SO FAR! BANGER
meia boca
Lets give her a cinematic and 23 dashes
NO SÉ POR QUE PERO PENSE QUE ERA LA CANCIÓN DE BTS
oh god!
That video was Art.
Ok
진짜 이런건 뒤지게 잘만드네
Change Ambessa with Faker, add some Worlds references from last year and you have the Worlds Video we all wanted
amigo es normal que me entren tantos sentimientos al ver los videos musicales del lol hasta el punto de casi derramar una lagrima? my god
Not Lil Nas X 🤭   (It’s a joke btw)
Wow.. but I still think u guys should fix the previous one
이거 만들시간에 티원 뮤비나 다시 만들지 ㅋㅋ
They took the existing Noxus Lore and inserted something new in it fully respecting the imagery. Karthus is singing with pride somewhere.
Here goes concord
Sorry but... Etretat ?
Swain look so sick🔥
Эпик.
Easily better song than.. Well, good to see more coming our way❤
Super decepcionado,  esperaba escuchar a BTS.
Ambessa prestige before shes even out ?!
I think Wolf walked up to her, as if to ask. Will you fight to live? But in the end she actually was going to accept death. Thats why even though she was Noxian she actually accepted a gift and met Lamb at the edge of the afterlife. They show her in all those scenes after fighting standing in those different afterlives as if she has accepted her place. But then she become uncertain at the end, when she realizes she is still pregnant that her child still lives. So even tho she had accepted her death she decides to live again.
perma ban en ranked
zeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd            \
amazing
contexto?
One of the best League of Legends videos ever.
I'm counting this as Ambessa's theme song.
Wow
Eh isso, nada mais nada menos 1:24 min
Zaaamn, Ambessa debuting with her own music video.
blood, sweat and tears, muy BTS referencia
Wtf did I just watch?
creo que es el peor video que ha hecho riot DENLE LAS GRACIAS A BEYONCE empresa indie
Good Song would have loved more champions in it
video  👍 Music 👎
Ambessa😢
black woman..
No entendí ni merga
.
Eu passaria horas e horas vendo cinemática do lol é de arrepiar dmsss, muito bom sempre ta doido
everytime we get lore i pray we begin getting more, the drip feeding of lore makes me so sad
븅신들 ㅋㅋㅋ
חרא שיר
nice
Pensé que de BTS XDXD😊
그니까 이렇게 깔끔하게 뽑는게 되는데 월즈 뮤비를 그렇게 만들었다는거지?
Когда-нибудь рито перестанут делать "сильных и независимых женщик афро-американок" и в лиге вновь появятся интересные персонажи  (:
wAKANDA fOR eVER
Tendi nada
Is that Pantheon before he split from the aspect? That’s what makes the most sense to me, Mbessa was fighting War itself
What was that, Pantheon, Kindred, Swain, Katarina, and potentially Lissandra?
That was amazing wow.
ambessa,  los kindred, phanteon, swain y katarina...la muerte en el lugar que se merece :D espectacular, me hubiese gustado ver a kata en acción. Espero salga uno aspecto definitivo con semejante cinemática
Did I see Katarina swain and pantheon in the background at 3:25?
какая-то наркомания с каплей повестки блм
Ambessa carrying the sheep symbolizing her childishness/innocence, as shown later by her crying when she sees her as a child holding the sheep, and in the end the Kindreds transforming everything into a new life force for her who in the end didn't lose her innocence, it just passed to Mel, the spiritual ordeal that the kindreds give her is very interesting, fighting to be strong the strongest is what she brings with her when she arrives in Arcane S1 and it became more evident why she is like that and why she thinks Mel is weak because Mel inherited her innocence... it makes sense in my head
I have no clue what is happening but it sure is awesome
Que gran hermosura guerrera digna🎶❤️‍🔥🔥💪✨
Noxus cỡ đó Demacia cỡ nào
Im in love with Kindred and Swain, that was sick
we need more fortiche and beaches
No se por que siguen quitándose la flecha, ¿Saben que eso produce un hemorragia grave?
4:00 GUYS IT's ETRETAT we're IN FRANCE
i cant find this song anywhere
que hermoso pantheon
이렇게 잘 만들수있는데 왜 이번 월즈 뮤비는 그따구로 만든거임?
Bring back the old league of legends...
blackie
White Lifes Matter
is the 2024 worlds theme song for T1 out yet?
Not bad, guys 👏
I love the lore on how ambessa became fearless of death or such or how she embrace all the challenges but girl you do not have the rights to pose like viego
worlds 2024, take notes. THIS, is how you make a song that makes people care and get excited. This cooked while LP burned the dish before it was even in the oven
Tbskyen wake up new league music video—
E…Epic
I love everyone's points regarding the lore, and I couldn't agree with you more, BUT CAN WE PLEASE TALK ABOUT THE ANIMATION AND CONGRATULATE THE PEOPLE WORKING BEHIND THIS MASTERPIECE? WHY IS IT SO GOOD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK, WE ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE IT!
Bad vocal, ruined it
I don’t get it
These are backstory scenes from Arcane  season 2
Can we add Christian Champion to play with we got panthoen a spartan a pirate a monk
que merda heim
So like, she did the worst thing she could do when being shot by a broadhead...... do game devs not think this kinda stuff through?
"A wolf has no mercy"   DAMMM that hits even harder now
This is just pure art. Immaculate.
quick question: in Arcane ep. 8, Ambessa mentions her father bringing her to the battle of hildenaard (i forgor the exact name), giving her a coin for every blade she retrieved from the fallen. is it just me or was Ambessa heavily implied to be raised as actual royalty? bc that seems to contradict my understanding of this music video, which shows Ambessa as being something of a self-made woman (the description says, "this is how a wolf takes the throne", implying she didn't have it originally?) idk what this means. also, fetus mel also features a similar shot to that of the last shot from s1, that being, part of mel starts glowing, then a quick zoom out toward some important action. is mel some kind of god?
Really hard to enjoy this video with how terrified/upset I am about her ridiculous design
I can't believe Fortiche has time for cinematics like this
Puros comentarios en ingles no entiendo nadaaaaa
2:33 스웨인 판테온 카타리나   스킨?  3:29 이번에 나올 스킨들?
그래... 이거 만드느라 월즈 뮤비를 그꼬라지로 좆창낸 거지??
where this legengs? I need this legends
월즈 뮤비를 이 퀄리티로 만들어주지 아쉽네
League in 2024 Haha!
Vanguard moment
I'd rather have some blood, sweats, and *beers* amiright fellas?
el video un sinsentido la cancion esta buena
anyone else thought ekko turned trans? i was so confused
Did the wolf impregnate her or she's already and the Life and Death spare her life for the life inside?
Those cultists look very Targonian, like the celestial beings... I wonder if Ambessa ever tried to climb Targon? We know Demacians have but not Noxians... Swain goes to Ionia for power Ambessa goes West to Targon
This is BTS song
I just realized, she gave her peaceful death to Mel. Beacue her daughter was clutching the lamb staring at her she was planning to sacrifice herself to the wolf so her daughter could live. Instead, she was given her second life but her true death won't be a peaceful one.
breed me pantheon
Kindred, Solari rakkor warriors, Xerath followers? Baby Mel showing magic powers?
CHILLS
2:03 my new wallpaper
NT
Do One With JINX Or VIOLET Next 😮
Heavy is the crown is far better
이거 만드려고 월즈 뮤직비디오는 외주때렸냐는 나쁜말은 ㄴㄴㄴㄴㄴ
What is happening with riot, did they stop release hits and just becamse ordinary music releaser
2:33  next champions???
Since this is a 4 minute long video, does it mean that necrit will make a 40 minute long one?
Y de pronto así por que si Riot se suelta tremenda pieza de arte :o ♥
GUYS SHE'S PREGNANT
The clip itself is amazing, sadly i'm not fan of the voice, just personal taste tho. But yeah visually, wow.
Nah did they really just drop this BANGER out of nowhere???
An absolute masterpiece
This has more story than the worlds mv, lol
heh 420
Man, the beat up this woman will do with jinx for killing her doughter is no joke
THE SONG'S NAME PLS
It’s so good I already rewatched 7times 😅
Ok
better than ksi music
pantheon and kindred ambessa dealing with the beings at the top of runeterras hierarchy says alot makes total sense for atreus to give her an absolute beatdown
Can someone please explain to me wtf the story is?????
arcane 2 .will be remarkble
I'm sensing there's some allusions to the Turkic Origin Myth of Asena a she wolf who saves the lone survivor of a battle and nurses him back to health and then mates with him to give birth to the first Turks.
wait what; She's pregnant in a battlefield, and got an arrow in her stomach?
No entendí nada, gracias RiOT 🤗
GODDD
This is beyond amazing this is mind blowingly beautiful
This cinematic may foreshadow how gruesome Ambessa's death would be in Arcane season 2.
I'm speechless. Just. WOW.
Man....i saw the notification for this video DURING the semifinals....yall are sick and intelligent
there are shades of league of legends in this god of war clip
Man fckthis poopywhoopy champ. We need more DASHES so League turn into Naruto next Generation or dragonball
I have such a strong aversion to the character Ambessa since the first arcane and now Riot is pushing her super hard, how sad
Always Noxus...Demacian when...?
como que no es la cancion de los bts?
Nah woke and bad song :/
Пантеон как всегда на кондициях )
Did the baby bring her back to life?
Isso ficou tão lindo.
campeã zarra pra caralho, em tudo. comum, sem carisma, sem personalidade marcante, parece mais uma npc
Vídeo ritualístico da poha kkkk
I wish Riot next year with 3 internationals are going to make champions reveals feel special, like one for each international.
The Golden Lamb
Camille as a back up dancer 😂
imagine giving an entire music video to a champion's release
So, riot just put more effort into a new champions release trailer /music video than in Fakers 4 World's title Legacy, cool
This is beautiful.  Such good story line.  Riot isn't just creating a story; they're creating a friggin' universe of drama that rivals many well-written anime.  And I say bring it on!
why is the music so bad :( what happened riot
The art team for riot is so good.
This isn't gonna be the third song at worlds finals opening ceremony, is it..? Please.
This song should be the Worlds 2024 theme song
♥♥♥♥
achei tudo, porem pessimo que nao apareceu as maiores
tá tão foda... omg..
League of legends makes a good game for being a music producing company
Riot + Fortiche never disapoints! 🗣🔥
FLAMENGO
ZEUS GIVE ME PANTHEON LEGENDARY AND MY LIFE IS YOURS
What a dope video! Redemption for the worlds one :D
So it seems like Ambessa could represent the aspect of death. Just based on the video and her interaction with Kindred.
nerf ambessa
Is it too late to not include this character in the game? This is just so divorced from League of Legends at this point that it's tragic.
How I interpret the music video:  In a near death state, it seems Ambessa's consciousness went to a type of Noxian mythos "Valhalla" (realm of honorably fallen warriors, from the past, present, and possible future), was tested (sacrificing a peaceful life / death from the Lamb and never backing down from the Wolf), and was proven worthy of joining the pantheon of "Wolf's Chosen" in the afterlife. But then her unborn child, which appears to have magical powers, was able to subconsciously use its magic to heal / resuscitate Ambessa and brought her back from her near death state / "Valhalla".
Riot never misses with these
Praise JOKO!!
LOOOOOVE this
Takipariu Riot, mandou bem demais!!! Lindo de se assistir.
So Ambessa trained under Pantheon?
Is that Mercedes Pantheon?
Fortiche's art style is simply on another level, its like watching a painting come to life, hope the studio has a long life and takes good care of their workers cause they are making remarkable stuff here.
cinematic: 🦁   game: 🐱
So this is where the entire budget for this year's Worlds song was spent.
Ambessa, Pantheon, Swain, Kindred and... Katarina ?
Fix your matchmaking to use individual performance rather than pump out all these pretty videos.
Katarina ?
if Necrit's vid is gonna be less than 30mins for this music video, I'll start a riot.
3:32 is that swain and katarina?
pode sair do off BTS
great video, music wasn't great though
Spectacular music video, broken kit btw. Man, I thought previous champions had a lot of dash. Once again Riot cooked its main meal
Это шикарно! Спасибо за впечатляющий клип и отличную песню, которая у меня теперь на повторе! Очень круто!!!❤❤❤
Wtf is this?
More Fortiche Animation Music Videos!
jesus christ stop with the music videos
I am the one who noticed that she’s carrying Mel in her belly, 3:30 just makin sure 😅
Kindred, Swain, Katarina, Pantheon e Ambessa, Riot, você arrasou e não foi pouco 🫦
is she pregante?
Cinema
wake up necrit time to do some rambling
TBSkyen: Finishes editing a 5hr arcane animation breakdown Riot: ehehehehee
titan kata,pant nad swain hmmm
Así es, yo tampoco entendí nada 😂
I love how wolf (kindred, the symbol of death) comes for her in the beginning, and you can see wolf walk away in the end because it is not her time yet. Her time to fight is only beginning...
I think league would be much prettier if the in game characters would have the Fortiche touch
Was this league or wow trailer? Or every other game coming out it. So lame
aam Is it just me or is she pregnant and seems to be losing the baby?
Why are they hyping a champion with multiple dashes.  A weird champion design. An old noxian buffed granny but her kit is like an ionian ninja instead of a fronline bruiser
So Ambessa is sort of an Ascended? Wicked
월즈 뮤비 개쳐망한게 두개 만드느라 개판된거였네 십새기들
Not as good as “Still Here” music video but still interesting nonetheless. If a bit creepy.
I Guess it’s time to get back to ranked!!
I Just remembered BTS, I was sure It would bê something related
Pretty underwhelming just like your nurffs and buffs.
Riot is back ?
Will this song also be banned from the Worlds live stream too? 😂
4 min de vidéo pour promouvoir un champion... il va être totalement broken c'est sur hahaha
When your survive to a fight with Azir soldiers, a confrontation with the incarnation of the war, and the concept of the death decide you don't die, I think you'll important...
피 땀 눈물?
Really liked this, champs kit, still busted... Dx
BARBARA??? FROM ABBOTT ELEMENTARY SINGS THIS???
New gym song just launched let's go

can you pls make it only the audio for be able to hear it without ambessa screams and all this? xd
That was awesome, the art was top notch. I just wish i could understand the words of the song without subtitles, I put it up high volume and still can only understand every other word. Also dude. 1:57 seconds. It looks like this is or is a reflection of Svika. NOT Ambessa? Probably just me but that would be a twist to be sure.
Was this pretty much an Ambessa origin story? (only thing I know lore wise about League of Legends is what was shown in Arcane btw)
Sheryl Lee Ralph a godess 🚬🗿
이건 퀄이 엄청 좋네? 더 짜증나게ㅠㅠ24 월즈 노래랑 뮤비는 그따구면서ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ
2:30 I love how Ambessa's scars are gold, like kintsugi (the Japanese art of fixing broken ceramic with gold, highlighting its cracks as it strengthens them). That is a perfect metaphor for Ambessa.
qualidade impecavel
Kindred blessed/saved her and she survived because she was pregnant with Mel? Mel inherited her powers? (Thus, the glowing gold ornaments on her body when Jinx’s rocket was about to collide?)
Ambessa origin story?
She is pregnant
Mouth of Sauron lookin mfers
Pantheon stepping back as the other figures bathe in gold was so sick
Don't use this video to justify me a 50 dash champ. Nice try Rito.
Seeing this really makes me wonder how she birthed someone as soft as Mel. Not saying it’s impossible or anything, just that watching this puts it into perspective all over again.
mmmmm Randy Acosta?
❤
i can't believe it this video made want to rank idk why
So is this Ambessa?
Holy moly mommy?!
k´santa.
Stuff like this would make me an Ambessa main.
Pantheon tested her and let her live?
Creí que era la canción de BTS xD
A new champ, with a skinline made for them? Without being shoehorned into something that doesnt fit her. Wtf is happening at riot HQ?
Remember guys, never remove a piercing object from your body!
ICONIC!!!!!!!
league turning woke gg
WTF SHES PREGNANT????
Não era UM lobo, era O Lobo...
They never miss <3 <3
Wow❤❤
league of legends Champs dis:🟫🟫🟫🟫
Ryze appears But I won't tell you where
3:57 So basically Fortiche went on holiday to Etretat and they went "Hey, let's put these cliffs in the music video".  And I'm glad they did
I don't play LoL. I have never watched Arkane. And I probably never will. But I watch every single one of these music videos, and they are all absolute bangers.
i was waiting for darius great video still
proceed to make your partners banned
Maybe the lamb is the  golden fleece once that It means a big power of heal. I would like to know all the references 😭😭 Everything looks so amazing
black people be like:
Dope
Fortiche art is a zenith!
All this effort but the champ itself is a low effort copy pasta of renekton and shyvana. Sad.
These are the most insane animations I've ever seen
The emotions I felt watching this clip. League of legends is truly in a league of its own.
they really dedicate a song for their new 2.0 ksante.
Wow! Young Ambessa in tears, that's exactly where Mel's generational trauma began!
월즈 뮤비를 일케 만들어주지...
We are waiting. Necrit
Hiiiiiii!!!!
i really hope this gets featured in worlds
I wish she had a heavier weapon so she could make better use of her muscle. Feels like her little cleavers would be better utilized on a more nimble and slimer person
Bro what just happened is that embesa? who what huh
Nice wukong as a main character
generic pop music.exe
Wait… this means this song is for the opening ceremony of worlds too?? Now im more hype
Looks pretty mediocre actually.
Eh
that was like watching a whole movie story
Who else saw the title and thought this was BTS? 😂💜
Waiter waiter!! One Necrit video explaining this please!!
wtf? now they completely change the champion now?
at 2:29 who are the champs behind him? swain and ???( is it kat?)
Imagine if the budget for this 4 minute video was used to keep your employees and not reusing shyvana's walking animation for this new champion
This is sooooooo sick!!! Im hyped for Ambessa, Im hyped for Arcane, and Im hyped for this skinline coming out. Riot is top notch recently, Im so happy as a fan of the whole Runeterra universe.
It looks like Ambessa was pregnant on the battlefield when she got shot, and pledged herself to the Wolf goddess to save her baby (Mel’s) life...or to give up her baby, if it was Kino.
OMG AMBESSAA???

Esperando o da Segunda Temporada de arcane

My GOSH Pantheon looks insane
Respect rito
Never have I watched a LoL music video and wondered so strongly, "wtf is going on?"
My new personality
Kind of sad that her name is Matriarch of War and not...well, anything to do with the wolf stuff.
And they could not make a MV focused on Faker's story
Break arrows off, don't pull them out.

I like how the lamb is not fully shape like it’s innocence

her upper chest is more jacked than panth's
Good
this is what i NEEDED , OMG <3
asi se ve un bongaso en ayunas
Gonna be mad if this masterpiece isn't performed during the worlds final's opening
Imagine if the Wonder Woman movies were 1/2 as good as this music video
yeah yeah we get it women are strong blablabla
I think the girl in this video is Ambessa from arcane
Okay, but that was a baby with golden eyes @3:39 Is that meant to be Mel? (I'm bias, Mel was my fave, but I'm hoping this is a hint that she's alive and her mom has a super special connection to her that is still gonna be important in both their stories) Maybe golden eyes is a sign golden magic (like maybe that was gold magic lighting up right at the end of last season)
this is fkn sick
Quanto estilo cara pqp Animação fodaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
It’s good, but it definitely didn’t top ENEMY in the slightest
Riot: we have imagine dragons at home.
Video is mid but song is fire.
buooooo
mais ce BANGER!!!! best teaser et musique 2024, c'est pas discutable ça aurait pu être la musique du world 2025
im ignoring that they retconned kindred to be a spirit of death, to me, kindred IS death.
is Mel's Mom?
2:28 SWAIN
Custodes
What Riot just did here is incredible. What a great character and build with this video. I wish Aulus from Mobile Legends Bang Bang had that kind of care by the devs - he helped me get through a lot. Heroes, champions, good characters are the ultimate symbol of strength, perseverance, determination and kindness. Obviously, everyone should appreciate this kind of love Riot build into her game.
С каждым годом все хуже и хуже, держите планку, молодцы)
Будет такой же кал на уровне ксанте сначала будет перебафаный мобильный перс а потом занерфят в хлам и пикрейт у неё будет на уровне старой помойки
Wake up  > Sit on toilet > Open YT > See this title > Watch the first 10 sec > Think "This is epic. So the World's MV was April Fool. This is the real one..." > Watch the rest of the video and enjoy every moment. > Look at the calendar. > Get confused.
Okay but, who is she why do we care about her? Its a bit tilting to get that much attention from riot team as somewhat side character of an animation show.
10/10

Riot u have wrong date in Ru translation. In ru it is 6 November 2025! Change please
she looks like a man...
This is amazingly beautiful... The visuals, the beat, HER VOICE omg Riot ejecutives be really making better music than most artists
Ambessa looks like Aloy from horizon zero dawn if she was black and was a warrior instead of a ranger
Perfect as always... Riot making this stuffs ^^
What is going on?
i keep hearing no fear of sauron XD also NO GEESE
классная блек попка
Still can't afford new walking animations for Memebessa.
ambessa en "los cabos"
GOD these never fail to give me chills the animation was phenomenal
BtK tkK
then studios try to find  how to copy the fortiche's style  , fortiche evolves !
I don't like the song.
no entendi, se la papean y luego sobrevive porque si
I read the title and hoped for a Solence collab x0
раньше видосы были лучше, скрытый смысл что хер поймешь...
I was searching for BTS blood sweat and tears and found this masterpeice by chance
Smash
This is at least 3 hours of Necrit content.
unbelievably insane. gorgeous beyond belief
Winston Churchill would be proud.
1:24 FATHER
This music just not hit like the others
CANT WAIT TO SEE THIS LIVE AT FINALS
Wow :)
I thinked its BTS😂
guys, has anyone seen Necrit around here ?
top, bom seria se o lol fosse igual
Lindo de mais
Fortiche keeps cooking and I am compelled to consume it. This is so absolutely beautiful I cannot begin to explain how ecstatic I am to see an animated studio that's so passionate about a story and so well equipped to make it with this level of mastery. I am dead serious when I say that Fortiche has made me genuinely excited about cinema again in all of what they do in Arcane. I hope one day they make something that would be put in theaters because all of their hard work deserves the biggest screen and the most high quality speakers. I want to inject their art work directly into my veins, this computer screen isn't enough! Cheers to you, Riot Games, for forging a stable friendship with such talented artists, and thank you Fortiche for taking Christian Linke and Alex Yee's vision, adopting it as your own, and going above and beyond in all areas of execution. I cannot wait for Season 2, and I await eagerly for any and all future projects 💕

Drop it on spotify now
That's how you design a strong female lead!!!
mais um vídeo que o minverva vai gerar um conteúdo de 2 horas kkkkkkkkkkk
This is seriously connecting with Mount Targon lore.
so does it means Mel Medarda (the baby in her belly) has some kind of powers, and therefore, saves everyone after jinx's rocket hit the window ?
this goes so hard
Entonces el hijo de ella está vivo
I thought it was a BTS cover 😅
Clearly, Fortiche
when i open league of legend its stuck at loading scren lmao
massa
If Ambessa, Pantheon, Swain and Katarina all are there because once they resisted the death, isn't Tryndamere should be there too? And it will be 5 people on the screen, not a empty place besides of Katarina.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ어찌된게 이번 월즈 노래보다 모든면애서 더 퀄리티가 좋냐…
Kirians?
Ow... My... GOOOOSSH
agend 2023 👎👎🤢🤢
the lyrics sound ai generated or written by a teenager
simplemente patetico. En que momento con todo lo bueno que tiene el juego se le dio tantas vueltas retorcidas? HORRIBLE!
Was looking for BTS' Blood Sweat & Tears, landed here....
Ambessa meeting Kindred and having medarda in her tummy during the war.
Riot order this level of production for new champ but low budget for the world song
волки не люди, люди не волки. Ауф!!!
"Lamb, tell me a story..."
I love this them song lets play lol
Is that Ambessa??      Oh, I'm calling it now: She's going to go toe-to-toe with Warwick. Wolf vs wolf
why women as a warrior ?
Another one? 😮
6 November 2025?
can yall animate frame lock for us pls
When she cried, I started crying. As always , LOL deliver songs that's fire. I had to rewatch the video over and over to get all the tiny details.
Nobody wanna talk about mel? She probably has powers
…Wait Riot makes games?
So, conan the barbarian... but female?
I always look forward to Leagues music videos they never disappoint.
a black strong independent woman
TBSkyen is going to turn this into an hour-long breakdown and I can't wait to see it.
3:57 why she is pregnant from Viego? Wasn't he mourning his wife?
great cinematic for a champion who in 2 months will be nerfed to death
She was pregnant with mel
вырывать стрелу из себя было глупой идеей
SMELL D.E.I HER
NO RIOT NO AMOUNT OF AMAZING CHARACTERIZATION WILL TAKE AWAY THE FACT THAT SHES A BRUISIER A DASH ON EVERY ABILITY
looks like reskinned Vi from arcane
song is ok if you like this styl of music, is it soul or jazz there are using here?
3:37 IS MEL ALIVE BECAUSE SHE WAS PRT OF AMBESSA WHEN AMBESSA GOT GODLY POWERS?!  (Don’t spoil S2!)
Pantheon sola
What a powerful voice!
YAAAAAAAAAAASSSSW
Que coisa mais linda de assistir e ouvir! ❤ Fenomenal.
Don't woke the game please
I thought it was a BTS colab
i liked it well done to everybody who did this the artists the visual team everybody, but why no subtitle's ?  her pronunciation is kinda rough like a axe it still cuts its still is an axe but its kinda roughed up (i am not saying the voice actor is bad i am not saying that she should have perfect english pronunciation's of everysingle word she is a battle roughned worrior ofc she has a way of pronunciation that reflects its character and stuff.  still, i did not understood some of the words while i was listening)
I feel more the symbolysm of this, how she sacrified the sheep, that also means her own innocent, peacefulness and weakness, she makes a deal with the wolf and abandons what it makes her weak, even if it hurts her, she sacrificies it to serve the wolf with fury, determination and ambition, she becomes the wolf itself.
LLoré y mi esposo se hizo pipí al ver a pantheon. Gracias riot.
That muscle mommy who fights her demons in the gym and is getting packed in no time. No one can hurt her anymore, she s been to her lowest , she can only win from now on. She s reborn, reformed !She s Her ! Slayyyyy
Comment for algorithm
dont release the champion

Why do I see bretman rock
Ojalá desarrollarán así de bien el emparejamiento
Os Kindreds só comparecem em teasers fodas ❤
music video: 10/10 Lyrics: 3/10
CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NECRIT VID 🎉❤
2:28 We can see how Ambessa sees Swain and Katarina but the middle character looks like a pantheon but the pantheon is not part of Noxus, or maybe it's her way of seeing strong people and Pantheon is part of it. Plus all these champions survived death so Kindred maybe.
how does someone goes to war PREGNANT??????
❤
Song doesn't fit Ambessa
Gorgeous ❤ thank you for this art ❤️
I love Kindred ❤
so many n or women lately, lol so over
Se eu entendi alguma desgraça eu me dane
Is Ambessa an emperor of Noxus just like Swain and Darius
Amazing 👏🥰🥰👏🇧🇷👑
In the beginning I was thinking this was ekko 💀
The goosebumps clip is INCREDIBLE. After the childhood champions (milio, smulder), this champion is just power. I'm glad, thank you
Okay this was crazy hard

You had better ones this one did not hit the spot for me
Crazy cool lore video and the song is amazing. Lamb and Wolf symbolized differently on the Battlefield this time.
Is she trained by Pantheon? That be insane
Can you take few bucks from movie department and send to ingame animation? Poor guys have to recycle  shyvanna  in order to f eed their kids.
Lmao as army i was confused by the title of the song
Great song and looking like a great skinline.
Uganda type of beat ahh
2:03 that pantheon w really do hurt lol
Hey funny lore people this is the video!
Hurry Necrit! We are waiting for you <3
Trying to make a linear story takes away a lot of the magic honestly. I see it as ambessa fighting death in order to stay alive for the sake of kino/mel and the symbolism of sacrifice she carries with her. Not sure about anything else but overall the writing and the design for this story is INCREDIBLE. Seeing ambessa’s story on going from an injured pregnant woman in a battlefield to the titan she is today is absolutely incredible. Thank you for this ❤
What does Kindred, Pantheon, Katarina and Swain have to do with Ambessa? Isn't she from Shurima like Samira, Sivir and Azir, etc are?
CINEMA
Okay, Riot Games, how is THIS not the Worlds Anthem, huh? This goes so hard🔥
my friends and family will never understand how much blood sweat and tears it takes to be this mediocre at a game i don't even like.
4/10
When she met kindred, I wonder if the lamb aspect took her child that was pierced by the arrow, or if she offered it when she saw wolf coming for her.
Strange choice.
nice clip, ill wait for Necrit to explain, see you all there
Si, esto es arte
take note hollywood this is how u develop a strong female lead within 4 mins, what an absoulte masterpeice EPIC!!!`
Make more male champs.
Parece a personagem do Clash Royale 😅 ainda mais segurando esse carneiro kk
The smeared face paint was the color of the trans flag!
Nobody can top Leauge and their music and animation team
this is insane
With this sacred treasure I summon NECRIT.
this is better than the anthem MV. Arcane> lol esports according to riot
way better than heavy as the crown
This is some of those season songs like "the call"?
I forget her name, but I wonder if the woman in the video is the Noxian chieftain whose daughter is one of the councilors of Piltover in Arcane?
I hate Ambessa in Arcane but this is amazing omg I can’t wait for her to drop in league😻
Entendi foi nada.
u should fire every lgbqt+xraytraincringe devs from ur company and hire some chads to bring back good content
Giving away the lamb and embracing the wolf riot I hate you but these mfs are genuises 😌😌😌😌
boring...
Не буду смотреть до сериала
SKZ hinting at this in their "Come Play (Preview)"s in the description ^.^ so hopefully "Remember Me" will be next or "Sucker" or "The Line"
Dayum, Fortiche has done it again!  Really nice method of portraying backstory lore for Ambessa through song, visuals and symbolism, rather than simple exposition. 👍❤
Black vi
Daswm this is the nut
Que lindo ❤
@nerissa chama aqui
Жалко в доте таких клипов не делают! RIOT GAMES вы лучшие!!!
I’m super curious on the timeline of everything for this. If the end is showing the invasion of Ionia and that is Mel/Kino in her womb then someone like Akali or Irelia would be in their late 30s during Arcane which is super odd and doesn’t make sense for a lot of things. Singed is also supposed to supply chemical weapons to Noxus for the invasion and it seems like the Noxians only meet him in season 2 so I am confused on time frames here.
oh yeah mell 100% died in s1 and shes gonna want to get revenge
The visuals, the voice, the rhythm... Everything is perfect.
ambasa >>> faker
Increíble canción 😮.
n entendi porra nenhuma
Compare this to Rell's video.  What a shame.
I never thought I´d hate a LOL character this much and I dont even know why, I disliked her in Arcane a lot and as a champion with lots of mobility I hater her duble.
good song, good lore,
Revivio el lol
Better than Faking Park
nerf akali
I have a theory specifically about the end when the silhouette of a baby appears, as she was shot in the abdomen with an arrow, the wolf came to take the child and not her.
This music company puts out bangers only, the game they made is ok too i guess.
The new BTS song hits different
no entendi ni vergas
this song is way better than worlds 'heavy is the crown'
I'm so lost
MY GOD MEL HAS THE POWER OF KINDRED OMGG
🗿👌
Me atraspaste, es CINE 🚬
isn't it the cliffs of Etretat at the end ???
Probably music is nice. But I uninstall this game 'coz I can't load into the game, I can play any other game but Riot now with this Vanguard totally ruined my exp so I move to another game. Sadge but true.
welp adding this song to my playlist
Mom can we have Embessa ? 3:30 No we have Embessa at home (ingame screenshot)
3:06 Ambessa es Argentina 100% confirmado
FOR NOXUS
League of legends always with the fire music 🔥
maybe Kindred let Ambessa come back to life because she knows the role that her and Mel will play?
God
absolutely LOVE riot's use of Kindred now. As a Kindred main since their release, this has been so exciting
la verdad es que me dieron ganas de mirar la segunda temporada de arcane
Fire
3:03  是我第一次看見這遊戲的人物如此舞動身體
The song is so bad.
Lol are they at Cabo San Lucas at the end there???
this is where the faker money went
Someone ever told her that ripping the arrow out and then walking around is generaly a bad idea
mel's in there
pant trained her..!!!!
Wtf was all that? Was I supposed to understand any of it?
Better than worlds animation.
Kindred is black now or wut
Definitely better than worlds song
Giime like so i can feel famous guys 😂
Miles morales en el multiverso de lol XD
why is she black?
о негритянка, инклюзивно и в духе повесточки, судя по голосу поёт тоже афроамериканка? )))) а игры для европейцев будут? хотя учитывая сколько в европу навезли арабов и негров, это в принципе считай для новых европейцев )))
Gotta hit that Opening Ceremony quota.
Ritogomes quando quer faz algo bom!
Honestly mid
I fw this so heavy bro
Мне нравится
I love how you can see mel in her.
Que linda canção, que lindo vídeo, que linda interpretação. Deus está em todas as coisas, namastê! ❤❤❤❤
Dammm…Ambessa looks fire….i love her
Absolutely phenomenal
so mel is magically powered?
The pantheon katarina Swain and her. How the f. Rito can do such amazing music art and concepts and such an incredibly loose spaghetti game.
i just now noticed on my 4th watch through, the reason there is a baby in the womb at the end is because she is pregnant at the start.
ok actually put her in 2xko now
i love how much attention kindred is getting now, they are a god of DEATH they should be treated as one.
bnuy!  🐇
The hype is real.
HYPE
Great video. Bad game.
Cinema 🚬
Nothing to gain Everything to fear
Monthly reminder that Riot is an animations, art, and music company that also happens to make games  (jokes aside, Fortiche's work is bloody fantastic as always)
I saw it live in paris today it was very cool
They're trying to not make it feel like this champ will give us all a headache for the next 2 weeks after her release before they gut her down (i hope)
oh yes black lesbians league of legends plauyer base connects so well with thiss omggg slayyhy
ok delete vanguard now
?
is that Ambessa singing?
ekko mom?
Beautiful
Fantastic!
When on Spotify RITO. WHEN
❤
that's just bad
Que me dá, outra mulher no game
Pentakill Ambessa when
voice meh
Nice champ. Nice song. Confused background. Meh.
Клипец как будто ИИ создал 🤔
o comentário BR que você está procurando
Pure art, one of best music vids from Rito
This should have been the World's theme
Really cool! Wow! 😎
I am OBSESSED
meh
Это одно из лучших представлений героя.
It stinks of toleration
Wait so Ambessa is an aspect as well?
Shemight possibly be from Shurima.  You can see hand - warped Baccais found in Xerath's follower cards! :)
Je suis completement dinguo ou c'est Etretat ?
Really freaking cool as usual, Riot!!!
another sick cinematic by riot games
Какое же дерьмо
이렇게 잘만들수있으면서 왜 이번 월즈뮤비는 뭣같이 만든거냐
Wow, that was crazy good! The voice, the sound, the animation. Wow! I have no other words than masterpiece.
This is cringe
Mel in the Womb her eyes lighting up...Shes a Salria
ahhh of course fortiche
So much weird going on, the guy with the shield and spear looks more interesting.
now I understand why she is so ruthless
Wow I love black panther!!!! chills!!!! I even spilled my soylent!!!
The story that goes behind these scenes are so rich! I love that she has to literally shatter the lamb spirit to embrace being The Wolf - a touch on Kindred story line. The Aspect of War Pantheon trialling her if she was worthy. And there's the glowing eyes of the baby possibly Mel taking some influence from either the Lamb, Wolf, or Pantheon.   I love itttttttt!!
meh, too woke. The music's too generic and brain rot.
I have only just now registered how bad it will be for Jinx if Mel dies
*Wolf leaves her* *wakes* *rips arrow* Wolf sighs.
린킨파크월즈노래보다 낫네 왜 그리 만들었냐 라이엇…
So with kindred so you have 4 options. 1. Just die ( aatrox) 2. See death and embrace it ( Yasou) 3. Face death for another chance at life (Tryndamere) 4. Make a trade (Swain, Ambessa)   also 5. Get left on read ( poo Olaf)
The irony of making this after laying off so many people is telling.
Good evening, it’s magnificent! A big like 👍🔝🔥🔥 ✨🎵
Feels mc respawn 🎉
Her have Mel as well . Remember what she said in season 1. YOU MADE ME WEAK I COULDN’T BARE TO LOOK AT YOU WHEN I MADE THE NECESSARY DECISIONS TO KEEP OUR FAMILY SAFE
nerf ambessa
This was powerful!  ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
All the love to the artists that made this masterpiece ❤
Seraphine better be in arcane 2 ❤❤❤
Swain have a big balls
knowing it's young Ambessa makes it so good! I love life hardened characters who turned pain into strength, just like Silco
skinline (?)  : ambessa, swain, pantheon, katarina and kindred
Actual gameplay is a side hustle at this point...
cool
😳👍
Doesn't feel like it hit the mark this time for me.  I would've preferred her literally  stepping over the corpses of newly dead soldiers. Being attacked by endless numbers and receiving those scars.  Sure, joining the elite noxians is cool, but it should've been on the battlefield, not in a duel.  The baby in war is a selfish driver yes, but even for noxus sending someone pregnant to war seems extreme.  Narratively just didn't feel right.
PLEASE TELL ME SHERYL WILL BE AT WORLDS PERFORMING THIS
WHERE'S OUR NEW KDA? Evelynn's going to come and get you if you guys don't give us new KDA!
Well that explains ambessa’s philosophy
Alright Riot you are forgiven    This time.
buenisimo
As much as I think she's going to completely take over the rift, this music video is so badass. Amazing video, amazing song, well done! Way better than the worlds video where it was just all faker and linkin park lol.
2:34 swain??
Follower of the wolf? Why did that look like a version of kindred?
NOVEMBER 9th
eu sem enteder porra nenhuma: :)
This one is a masterpiece
Why is a pegnent woman fighting..
Okay, okay, maybe the song and the trailer with the backstory are cool, but it doesn't change the fact that Ambessa in the game is just broken and looks like Frankenstein's monster, made from the concepts of different champions, and even her visuals are very reminiscent of other champions: from Shivana with her movement to Vi with her ult. In this clip, you can already make theories about her getting her power from the astral world and that's why she has energy in the game like a ninja from Ionia, but fix the visuals in the game and nerf her, please
So Mel dies....  Sad...
Embessa telling Mel how she used to go to school every day
T1팬들은 보면 울화통이 치미는 영상....... 그래 니들은 할 수 있는데 안한 거 맞잖아.....
did the wolf just.... impregnate her
이게 뭐냐
14 years and am missing the day that I met her...
Necrit gonna make a movie out of the lore from this vid 😁
another banger that would be a dope worlds song
L
2:49 you can see Ambessa’s soul (the  lamb) being reshaped and now she’s a wolf
More budget than the worlds anthem, Great !
special  thx for nothing  hip-hop  part , so great without it
what a lore kasanta
🔥
So, is that Mel or is it another child that Ambessa loses? Because it almost looks like Kindred in there for the child and not for her.
Bad... It is a music video. It has nothing to do with the champ. You could have made a real Video instead of a Music video with scenes, no one understands. Ok the child in her is dead, but what with all the other stuff? Sometimes, less is more...
How can I "like" this video again!?
Where is KD/A??
So delicioso!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
animation is AMAZING!!!
Hmmm... where all this strong woman that can beat a man irl? Oh! I know a couple Lín Yùtíng and Iman Heliph XD
Necrit drooling right now cant wait for his take
don't know why but this song reminds me of a James Bond title song
3:01  this is Raum???
Riot games showing off they're top tier at everything but games
i didnt understand anything
Absolute masterpiece, this here is the og RIOT at work, very well done guys.
Wait, am I getting this right? She was pregnant AND at a battlefield? Crazy irresponsible lol
.
Por el nombre de la canción creí que era algo de los bts y nada q ver 😂😂😂😂
why would you go into combat pregnant wtf
This looks to me like Ambessa sacrificed her unborn child (not Mel or her brother) to survive/be brought back to life
There are communities of characters who would give their lives to have 1/10 of this video, but I'm not going to complain. It was really good.
So what I got from that was she was on the brink of death, "hallucinated" 90% of the music video, fought against death and was deemed worthy enough to live(Lambs respite), and became almost a desciple of death (at least, wolfs version of death)
This is a visual masterpiece!
The worse the game gets, the better the music videos get, this is amazing!!
Zeus! Your Daughter Has Returned.
CINEMA 🙌
normally i love leagues vids , but this one is a little ... too , love the song though.
No me detonó emocionalmente
I thought this was going to have BTS on the track at last.
I thought this was her VA 😂 this is crazy good 🙌
내 피땀눈물~
un poroto la cancion de worlds, esto es goddddddddddddddd
ZzZzZzZzzz
As expected, next Arcane season is going to be in Noxus
waaaay better than heavy is the crown
인종차별이나하는 쓰레기들
Kindred, Ambessa, Kat and Panth
when I read „Blood, Sweat & Tears“ my first thought was: why and where is BTS here? 😅 I know, it is not copyrighted by them, but still^^ it‘s such an iconic song for them😅 on another note: this is a great song! great voice, good video! ❤
Вырывая стрелу, ты не делаешь лучше, а добавляешь ещё больше внутренних повреждений и открываешь кровотечение, из за чего вскорости и умрёшь, а в остальном прекрасно)
Hello Wolf and Pantheon
ㅅㅂ 페이커 헌정 영상을 이렇게만 만들었어도... 이 새끼들은 진짜 페이커한테 감사한 게 아니라 페이커를 이용해 먹기만 하는 구만
Watching this made me want to be her petite goblet holding twink 🫣
please remake FAKER's video
This is SO COOL I love when riot does these music videos along with their content drops, it always makes it more immersive. I wish they would do these more often like they used to.
We haven't had a champion music video since like.. JINX?
I just clued in that Panth, Swain, and Katarina are probably getting what looks to be a new skinline for this.
nice shyvana rework
i wonder what Jax E has to say about this
Rare Garbo LoL music 💩💩💩
young ambessa?
Necrit tryping...
Explains why all her abilities are op
Here for Fortiche! These people are just insane!
говно
PERO QUE BASURA DE VIDEO, LO UNICO BUENO FUE VER A PANTHEON
Lol pc The worst team randomization system
This Arcane season 2 trailer is hype
Video and animation were amazing. The song and singer were awful.
Boring asf
Better than the World song cinematic by far
Sheeesh this video was absolutely gorgeous!
Cocorico, our French people have talent, un grand bravo Fortiche 👏
Alright guys, give Kindred the visual update it deserves already. (and ulti rework if possible)
SO two thing HI KINDRED LOVE TO SEE YOU AGAIN second (buongiorno lupa romana Dio aaaaaaah)
I think this is the worst music video made by riot yet😢
27 dashes in 30 seconds is too much idc if this song is good or not this character will be the most broken creation in the world
Is this younger Ambessa or another champ?
I... Restrain me now because oh my god. This is so good I just can''t. Yes. This. I am not okay
Am I the only one just watching the video and not listening to the music?
Pantheon: RIse. Repeat. Again.
Alright...... dope
So she did a Pact with Kindred?
wow Riot, wow.
THIS IS SO GOOD OMG
Ahhh Arcane champions always getting a lot more than than they actually deserve, sad. Can we just end this already and start the Bilgewater TV Show?
it's so respectable and important that her pregnancy isn't a barrier to any of her lore but a central, respected, interesting, and mysterious crux of her story
(⁠ ⁠/⁠^⁠ω⁠^⁠)⁠/⁠♪⁠♪
how did you manage to make it worse than ignite?
Not me screenshotting intensively because every scene looks just sooo artistic and neat 🔥🔥✨
Did she got impregnated by a wolf?
a ma zing
Noxian isn’t a race. It’s a creed.
also the cave.... looks like a rose.... might be hallucinating but what if
Hey! A better worlds song
*it’s just so peak*
this is our new champion ?
please don’t tell me i’m the only one that thinks ambessa looks pregnant on the battle field?
league videos have a cringe undertone throughout every video, this one is no different
i need a lyric sia
I have read that some people think that the lamb that she cares for so much but in the end sacrifices is her son (then in her womb) Kino, and that she let death (Wolf) marked him in exchange for her not dying
OH MY GOD
It's a choice. To fear and be a weak or find the strength. But true power we can find only in protecting someone or something. This is the Way.
Still just hoping arcane season 2 I get to see Oriana, Camillle, and Viktor
Анонс скинов за год
DEI ? No ! There's so much lore and power in this video
Entonces esa es Ambessa de joven? Si ya me vendieron al pj perfectamente
Napita namul
PANTHEON I'm so happy
How to stop listening this gold?
Pantheon looking like an absolute chad as always
one of the BEST things ive watched ever
What is going on here!!! Is this the backstory of Bessy???
INCRÍVEL, ISSO É CINEMA, OBRIGADO RIOT, MONO KINDRED AQUI
Ruim LoL.
Ambessa time 😮🎉
what is this?
The part she woke up and wolf go away make me cry. Thank u again riot games music
4:00 So is Etretat officially a Noxian territory now ?
the thing playing the drums looks like a cool champion, who s that? lol
2:43 the effect around the red hand is so good
would love to see Sheryl Lee Ralph performing this live!
02:26 , Katarina? 😳❤🔥
me mie, esta good
I see Riot is really paying us back for 2023 Cinematic by releasing "Still Here" and THIS.
Sheryl Lee Ralph sounds so good 👏
widzę minimum 20 minutowy materiał Marvecca
I LOVE THIS RIOT.
I really dislike this new media angle of having pregnant women running into warfare and life and death struggles to showcase their badassness. When all I see is the most reckless and self serving person too unfit to bring new life into the world in it. The exact opposite of what I believe the depiction wants to capture.  The last of us Wheel of time  This.   Not one depiction of it has been tasteful no matter how it’s presented.  Still this goes hard despite all that
This is about innocence leaving Ambessa in the face of death and destruction she's been forced to go through by her father. And it's like.. so freaking good. I hope it gets to show up in Arcane
why they gtta make me feel for ambessa
A Black Strong Female character everyone love and admire. Look how people can easily ignore race and gender as long as the story is good. Don't let those Holywood writer gaslight you into believe that you're Racist/Sexist/Bigot, you simply hate BAD PRODUCT.
Dat moment when you realize a new champion get a better MV than Worlds 2024 MV LOL
she was pregnant and go to war who let her go bro
The TBSkyen video about to be 5 hours long going through all this lore and the animation. That was sick
DON'T REMOVE AN ARROW AFTER BEING SHOT WITH ONE.  It can  do even more damage than the shot ( in the video she literally killed herself, sums up my soloq experience ).
black women
Viega
Banger
Wtf??
que?
OMG
The baby she carries might be her son, the one she mentioned had died. Or perhaps Mel...
Okay Rito you nailed it again in the video clips. But I'm still not playing that awful game of yours ever again!
Adivino, 500 dólares por ese Pantheon?
CAN WAITT !! WORLDS 24 🔥
Épico
just shortly before i saw her announcement, i told a friend it was quiet some time, that i was hyped for the release of a champion. but the excitement for a new champs is finally back, hopefully more champs from arcane will come.
Moh paia
So much better than this years Worlds song👍🏼😅❤️
"the weight of the world won’t bend my knees" THAT IS HARDDDD
Never bend ✊
Not sure i like this one, can't get into it
Blood Sweat? Is that just bleeding?
I liked it but tbh I kept waiting for James Bond to show up on screen :D .
Karai
Thought it was a BTS remake when i saw the song name lmao.
League of Woke 2024
Фигня какая-то. Бесполезный бред полумертвого воина
I dont get it, where is Linkin Park?
How many black ugly woman we have to see in games?
Are we at 300 years yet?
The autotune is a little too noticable here imo
É ASSIM QUE SE FAZ A PORCARIA DE UM PERSONAGEM SEM PRECISAR FORÇA IDEOOLOGIA CARAL***!!! SIMPLESMENTE FODA
Was the baby in her belly who had the golden eyes Nel? That would explain why her back glowed gold in Arcane right before the missle hit. There's so much to unpack in this video.
엣지러너 ost 커버해주면 좋겠다 느그집 해주면 딱일텐데 컨셉에도 어울리고
I think thats Panth, Kata, Swain, and her getting the skinline
bro i thought its a BTS COLLAB WTF XD would be awsome tho
i dont like it   :((((
this is an awful song
banger
If kindred made it to arcane, that would be FIRE
이게 월드노래 했어야함
WHAT A SONG NOT NEEDING RAP TO BE GOOD? WOW. Finally -_-
Hi necrit
katarina is so freaking cool here
Woman strong cause woman, woman cause she is strong, woooooow
all riot animation really inspire me because I'm a beginner student designer now and everything in this video is a masterpiece
Epic cool champion made into a cringe one... by the MV
Слишком много негров.
월즈 노래가 왜 이제 나왔노🤷
caralho velho, é bom demais!
So she is blessed by pantheon 😮 noice
She got that dog in her
For noxus!!!
No entendí nada :D
Riot is a music company
Is she  pregnant?????!!!!!!!
Yeah this is what i want to see from riot. This is what we need. i love this video.
Ambessa is such a badly designed champ both looks, lore and ingame wise.
Riot is cooking MMO..
I was enjoying it until she pulled the arrow out.😢
great, hope we get a musicvideo for every new champion and co, love it!
Mt foda
😅😅😅 yo no entiendo nada y no es por ponerle sal a la herida pero se me ve el video al wuok y no explica nada del origen del campeón y la canción no es tan buena
Really good!!!!!
Wait, is that a Noxian version of how they see Lamb (Kindred)?
This is fantastic
Meia boca em
I expected something better. The idiots see this and say "wow, it was amazing"... Anyway. I was definitely expecting something much better! Sorry.
Necrit, I expect a video AT LEAST 1 hour long about this
BUT WHY DOES THIS MV LOOK X TIMES BETTER THAN THE WORLDS 2024 SONG????
All this and they still cant fix the client
Does anyone else keep hearing Awaken from Season 9 when they listen to this song?
❤😢
QPORRAFOIESSAQEUACABEIDEASSISTIR, CINEMA!
okey?
New champion or what? Where is Connection with lol?
why is a pregnant women on the battlefield, seems like a bad idea
At 3:37 you can see baby mels back glowing the same way, as in the final moment in season 1 last episode.
THE SHERYL LEE RALPH. WTF, I FEEL LIKE NOT A BIG ENOUGH OF A DEAL IS BEING MADE THAT THEY GOT THE EMMY WINNING SHERYL LEE RALPH...
this skinline is about to Cost people their lives, not just their money
Not Linkin Park? Ignored
After KDA videos, all new videos bad again and again. Litterally no concept. Low musik, low explanations. Just bad and booring...
Ambessa. Shurima?
Isso está maravilhoso ❤🎉
Are we getting pantheon lore updates? He's the only non Noxian between Kata,Swain and her
no me gusto
Is she an Ionian who somehow got folded into the Noxus empire? Noxians don't care where you're from as long as you prove your worth. This could be the explanation for why she uses energy as a resource.
they don gain money. they make it
Pantheon vs 100 Trans Femboys or what is it
Give the respect of War on Gaza. This song is about War while people celebrate Worlds but kids and innocent people dying now. ❤❤❤ love lol love the worlds. 🤲🏼 🙏 ✌️ ☮️ we need peace
If the next series is about how Ambessa became what it is, I wouldn't complain at all.
a masterpiece
its so stupid. riot you are drunk, go home.
Goofy aahh song 💀
Blood-mid Sweat- bot Tears- top
why is Swain just chillin in the afterlife?
It almost sounds like Ambessa singing
necrit: STONKS
???👎
Unironically this is the best season 2 song that I’ve heard yet
Yalll… was that Katarina on the right @ 2:33 ??? Or am I tripping ?
oh no, I'm supposed the pity the antagonist instead of just liking them for being good at being bad🙁
Rework Ryze? 🤔
I was ready for the BTS version of this song, knowing how Rito gargles LCK balls.
You really created this masterpiece just for a video of a new  champ And the World Championship video for which you made this nonsense?!!!
Absolutely incredible!!!🔥❤ And they nailed the african art aesthetic so friggin' well with the surreal scenes
Jurei que ia odiar ela, mas deitei. Muito, muito, muito boa!
thanks god it's rock in english, not effeminated korean
What a masterpiece😮
PANTHEON MY GOATTT MY GOOOOOAAAAATTTTTT
Sheryl Lee Ralph, everyone! 👏
Сцены в пустыне вполне возможно отсылают к детству юной Амбессы, где возможно она была поймана работорговцами или иными личностями для продажи на рынке рабов, в это время у неё начал меняться характер (Амб добровольно отдаёт ягненка, на съедение волку), из-за того что потеряла свой дом и родных (что показывают слёзы грусти в моменте с девочка с Ягнёнком). Так возможно она попала в Ноксус. Уже там, её новый характер начал проявлять себя. В итоге она попала в касту воинов, где постоянно сражалась за власть и силу. Что по итогу вывело её на высокий уровень в иерархии Ноксуса, что показывает сцена с троном и мечем. В конце Сородич даёт ей символ её непоколебимости перед смертью и преградами, предрекая её судьбу той, что скорее умрёт от Волка, а не от Овечки.
How is anything connected to league of legends about this xD
Amazing!
Need to wait for Necrit to break it down haha
i didnt really care for it ngl  well made not like the 'other one'
El becerro de oro de Moisés
Everyone talking about Necrit.. I'm waiting for TBSkyen's unhinged 1-2hr long video breaking down the animation 😌
Wwtf BTS
Well I didn't even know this was coming, I opened it expecting nothing too great, and was met with a truly amazing video. Perhpaps one of the best music videos from Riot, definetely the one I was most impressed by.
피 땀 눈물
Riot is a music company
again 💩💩💩🙈🙉🙊🤮🤮🤮🤮🤡🤡🤡
better than season 14 theme。
I'm certainly positive that whatever is after Arcane is going to be about the Noxian invasion of Ionia. Really would tie Swain, Singed, and Ambessa.
đỉnh hơn cả nhạc cktg, mấy thím nhà Riot éo hiểu nghĩ gì, bài này làm nhạc cktg thì khét lẹt luôn
the song is amazing
Is that the new hero?
really nice mv for a champ that is going to be perma banned
Your brother fancies himself as a fox amongst the wolves, but if you want to last in this world you must be fox and the wolf. Ambessa was like Mel before war changed her
이해가 전혀안돼네
Tienen plata pa un video hardcore todo chévere, pero la animación de caminata de Ambessa es la misma que la de shyvana (?) 🤔
This was just the best
3:29 pantheon swain katarina behind
Battle Mom™
그래서 암베사가 렐엄마야 할무이야?
So she DID get her energy in game from being in the invasion of Ionia LMAO
I come here from Arcane so I know this is Ambessa's story but I have NO clue what's going on otherwise lmfao. Still, I enjoyed the video! Gorgeous animation and the song is so catchy.
En una película "el niño que domo el viento" vi algo parecido, cuando alguien moría llegaban unas "personas" (creo que eran personas) con máscaras y subidas en unos zancos a despedir o tal vez a darle la bienvenida a una vida (en la eternidad) a la persona que falleció, no sé si sea lo mismo que vi en este video 🤔
achei q era a musica do bts
are those going to be new champs?
Here before the RAT reacts to this
If thats why Mel is protected by gold, then thats better than what anyone else thought with Solaris
Not very great imo
NO WAY SHE WAS PREGNANT AND BATTLING WOW
gonna be honest I didn't like this one. I didn't understand what happened :/
이제 흑인이나 소수인종만 나오나. 백인은 나오지도 않겠네 이제

Blood sweat? Ew, they couldn't pick a better name, multy trillion dollar company bro ahhhhh, nerf Mordeksiser!!!!!
hahaha ale gowno
That mythology deserves to ge expanded upon. Like wakanda, but with wolves
판테온 제발 전설이길..
master pieace
@1:54 to @2:35 ... her refusing to give up for her daughter. The imagery is sick. Atreus would have had such respect for her.
nnot pulling out the arrow to make yourself bleed to death AND pulling it out backwards so you die faster
Black V looks awesome!!!
Young Ambessa is a baddie
no entendi ni mergas
hmm, I like the pumped-up version of the anti-mage personality more than the usual one.
What does this have to do with Xerath? Those are definitely Xerath cultists shown
it was fired until she sat on the throne like ksi
2:31  💪🏻💪🏻 never give up
we wuz kangs n shieet
Something to note here is that among the Noxian champions, it's Pantheon who seems to test everyone. If Noxus ever believed in the Targonian aspects, it would make sense that they would worship Pantheon, the Aspect of War, the man who struggled every minute to eventually become a god.  EDIT: It has come to my attention that this is not actually Atreus, but another chosen of the wolf that just happens to look like Pantheon. Though I wish to apologize for my error in judgement, I still stand by my statement above.
you don't pull the arrow out you break the end off it
Heavy is the crown better
guys are commas off-meta now?
i dont know why tears just starting to creep up, but man leave it to riot to hype up their legends like this.
The music is great, but it's hard to tell what is going on in the cinematic xD  And I miss Riot's old logo with that fist hitting screen. That was dope
Omg..... Riot you better give your animators a raise 'cause they have done a spectacular work I've never seen a more stunning MV than this in my life 😭
This music is soooooo much better than Worlds
Thoes weresome hard hallucinations
ksi statue goes hard ngl 1:18
Y la traducción?
Omg I'm so so so so SO MUCH IMPRESSED BY THIS! Especially with the lyrics.   Don't wash my spirit, don't cleanse my soul Can't break my courage, and I won't fall ’Cause that's all I know  You know how most of us would like to be appeared as good people, ya? We try to do the Right thing, to be the Good people, to be the Right person, but in the end, people can call us the words anyway. But she. She is accepting her nature, her Shadow, her path and the confidence in this is just... give me power will, ngl. I'm so much impressed by this character. I would NEVER expect to be more impressed by her, than by Vi, but here am I, covered in goosebumps and rewatching it again and again and finding more and more food for my soul and mind. Wow.
I love this music video!   N O W   N E R F   H E R
JA NASCEU FAMOSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Time to go 0-7  with my Akali
Amazing! Congrats @RiotGames
lfg
cade a legenda?
Жалко не хватило денег, чтоб исправили подбор игроков😅
Nahhhhh brah this is the mostró EPIC stuff Ríot released in a while🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This song has to go to Spotify.. 😮
how it feels to play one ranked game in emerald
wooooo KINDRED!!!!
BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS  MONEY MONEY MONEYYY YA!
GOATGOATGOATGOATGOATGOATGOATGOATGOATGOATGOATGOATGOATGOATGOATGOATGOATGOATGOATGOATGOATGOATGOATGOATGOATGOATGOATGOATGOATGOAT
Noxus power!
it looks rly ugly
Riot, my favorite music company making bangers again
a woman and black...is she straight at least?
I didn't understand sh.. what was that all about?
This video is really good! But "still here" still the best.
Cinema
If riot's only concerning was profites, it would be a music company by now  This prooves that riot still cares about her baby (league)
Where's the singer in MV?
, a riot quando quer ela consegue ne ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ musica do caralho
I thought it was going to be BTS's song 😭😭
this mv is much much better than World's theme song, both music and graphic part
BRIVIDI
meanwhile Vi gets the sittiest legendar ever known to man
개웃기네 월즈보다 퀄이 세배는 좋은데
So much emotions showing up, unimaginable.
Is it on spotify?
Esta es la historia de medarda y que estaba enbarazada de mel???
Pienso que Ambessa sacrifica a su hijo para poder salvarse.😢. Impresionante!!!!
Who cooked 💀
Not Pentaill = Not interested
Tendi foi nada
Nothing special about this cinematic.
How dare you make me like another character that's not Illaoi
Riot volviendo a sus videos épicos!! Por fin regresaste
Cringy AF
zzz
Awesooooooooooooooooome
This 4 min cinematic is better than their entire game.
RIOT：Ambessa＞Linkin Park＞Faker
😴
I don't know much about the lore behind the symbolism but from a purely artistic outsider perspective I love the symbolism of the lamb kind of representing her innocence and that in order for her to survive she's going to have to face excruciating hardship that will rip that innocence to pieces and reforge it into a hardened warrior.
왜 24롤드컵 영상은....😢
Тизер нового бога Таргона?
kasantes she dude sister... great......
Ahora kindred tiene seguidores? O ya había una secta así? Hace mucho que no juego ni sigo lol
as always, production is on another level
THIS IS THE BEST SKINLINE EVER MADE!!!!!
yeah this champ is going to be a massive problem for the next 2 years thanks riot
Each frame is worthy of an old master's painting; such grace!
Bellissima sempre top riot ❤❤❤
With every lore being told at this point by riot, i might give up my whole social life once league MMO  is released. I'm not even kidding...
3:01 WHJAT WAS THAT HAHAHAHAH 🤣🤣
Perfect, fix client.
It's not like someone killed her children, oh wait
PLEASE I BEG U RIOT. STOP MAKING CHAMPIONS. NO NEED TO DO IT
4/10
CINEMA
I need this on Spotify please @LeagueOfLegends 🙏
So a new champion’s got a MV, Linkin Park’s got a MV, but Faker could not have one of his own for winning his 4th Worlds after 7 years.
She's pregnant in this video.... 3:33 gives the impression what she gave up as a sacrificial lamb is her children. Which is why she cried at the sight of the child and lamb. The son who is already born and one lamb whom she was pregnant with, which we know now is Mel. She lost one in the show... i think this tells Mel's fate.
Song is trash.......
LOVE TO SEE 1 MORE RIDICOLOUS CHAMPION WITH 9090912309103 DASHES  AND MAKING MY LLIFE WORSE
Not gonna lie, this is the first video riot has made that I'm not excited to show people lol. Worst one to me so far.
She got a second chance to live then decided to kill herself by removing the arrow and bleeding out. Why does this happen so often in media? I thought it was common knowledge at this point to NOT REMOVE THE OBJECT FROM THE STAB WOUND.
hearsteel and k/da comeback when >:(
Another music company that can make game a little bit. 😅
I don't get it Looks awesome tho
El que hace estos vídeos se la recontra fuma jajajaja
You I We Have to do it. Split or Together. Creat our Wings to Fly to Home.
sjw
God please give me the League MMO ASAP
1:22 zaaamnnn
What a beatifull piece of art. Really shows that there´s still pasion on the Riot team. Hats off to the producers.
Magnificent
Am I crazy or were there physics? 1:58
This song sends a heavy message through every word she sings! Dang! I can't stop listening to it!
Arcane.. now this.. dei is rly strong in riot..
I just noticed that she went to war while being pregnant, and i think she was fearing that her child died because of that arrow which can be depicted by the cult scene where the lamb dies. But at the end she realised that her child is still alive.  This is some CRAZY stuff riot
Nah she actually thought she could take on Atreus😂
New skinline confirmed, Kindred, Ambessa, Pantheon, Swain and Kata at the end with other champ in background
Someone at Riot loving that Kindrussy.
Bts? 😅
Riot struck absolute gold with this studio and I’m glad they seem to have realized it.
that was....AWESOME
Uuuu Kinderd
que merda em
better than linkin park MV
Uma das melhores animações, a música uma das piores.
This song is better than worlds 2024 😢
Krlhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I'm still not giving you money Riot.
The fact that she is pregnant while facing death; You got me, it's cinema. 💀 🚬
👎👎👎
kindred cameo
THIS IS ART
The scars are really interesting as they appear before getting shield bashed.
Dei again..
saca a pica
Its gonna be great to see am Ambessa vs any mage like xerath
3:20 I'M SORRY BUT THIS WAS SO GOOD WTF
2:36 wolf dance gif :D
개좋은데
EVERYONE  talking about how multiple dashes break the game then they go and MAKE A CHAMP WITH 99999 dashs
hey hollywood, this is how you develop a strong female character. Take notes :)
Looks like a young Ambessa for me.
Nothing To Gain Everything To Fear
Never remove the arrow from the wound; it could worsen the bleeding.
se lucieron
Like a pan that slaps my face. 🍳
Bro, her daughter looks just like her!!!
Arreglen la caga de cliente y dejen de subir mierdas
So, Swain, Katarina and Pantheon have received Lamb's Respite? That's so cool
why is she a black person
?
Sangre,sudor y permaban
NERCIT WHERES THE VIDEO I NEED IT NOWWWWWWW
Marvec kiedy film XD boje się o jego stan psychiczny zobaczeniu tego heh ( oj dzieje się a raczej zaczyna się :3  )
fome la wea
I cant understand this cinematic but its cool
Ambessa holding baby goat.. Faker mom confirmed??
This song sounds so much like Elton John for some reason
a story about 200 year
Another strong and independent black LGBT woman? Not interested
Seja Bem-vinda, minha Rainha! VIDA LONGA À RAINHA DE RUNETERRA! 🖤
Que música incrível
Ебучая повесточка!
I guess we got the next skinline with Ambessa, Katarina, Swain and Pantheon
The baby is Rell
uffff
League getting more stupid year after year
Damm, Azir’s Reborn Has Made Its Effects 😮
Amazing, only downpoint is the voice IMO, for such a strong and powerful video, the singer seems to try to get to the required not but it sounds like its not his tone. Besides that is amazing
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
The quality of it should be faker's music video.........
Banger holy
mid
I expect a double length video from the one who shall not be named.
Old black women warrior....?  very pcful new champion.  But i like that.  Look good, look strong. But mage champ and long-range dealer are all dead. We have no hope.
There's so much background lore going on I'm bracing for a 55 minute Marvecc video
what a masterpiece, thats why i love this game
I might be wrong but the other 3 people i see pantheon swain and kitana  swain and kitana i would understand hut pantheon? Even if that is him i guess.
вы когда пинг исправите и в игру пустите? сыны проституток
This voice suits her so well
What if that little stone she took was  shared of pantheon the aspect not the man
ARCANE - League Of Legends*
KINDRED
is that fetus Mel or her brother?
No entendi nada pero banco fuerte al anti-mage a base de cordero.
Ok, not gonna lie...really epic😮
????
Gives me illoai vibes but...less tentcales and gods
Nice
This video gives me serious chills, this is easily one of their best animations. The music is so insanely good too. I haven't enjoyed a league video like this in a few years now. But I'm actually baffled the imaginary is so vibrant and well done.  Also its obvious and they showed it, but Ambessa is pregnant with Mel from arcane, and that implications of that is sorta prevalent, she is making a new life as she is dying
The visuals and the designs are top notch but the story and the song for me are a little lakig. Still like for the spectacle)
If some day Riot makes a series about the complete lore of league of legends, something like Arcane but on much bigger scale, it would be a dream come true.
Why does she look like young embessa
hey necrit, i know your looking at the comments. so that fetus, is that mel who may or may not have been empowered by kindred? just a possibility of what called her back from serving was being pregnant? and mel being infused... it could lead to implications for arcane 2 too.
This is want we need! Not garbage like concord, or bazz that type of anti human stuff.
NECRIT ITS BEEN 3 HOURS, I NEED MY DEEP DIVE,
I'm not Christian but it is silly and annoying that 99% of American elite companies are satanists... Golden calf huh?
Let them cook.
I m casting a summoning spell: Necrit.
3:32 this is gonna me a skinline isn’t it , pantheon , katarina and swain. With ambessa in the middle
Literal CHILLS. JUST CHILLS THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE VIDEO👑❤️‍🔥
암베사의 서사를 잘 풀어준 영상인데 막상보면 멀티버스의 늑대는 = 킨드레드 와 같은 느낌인데 정말 잘만든듯 아쉬운건 젊은 암베사 에서 멈춘게 좀 아쉬움 시간에 따른 현재의 암베사 늙은 암베사의 압축 서사를 보여줬음 더 좋았을거같음.
They clearly have the ability to create such great music videos, so why is the World Championship song made so poorly⋯⋯
For every 1 like = 1 Ambessa's dash
이상 하네 또 흑인이 나오네
noice
Where is Necrit to explain this to me?
woah woah woah KINDRED!
Con sói cũng tranh thủ ghê ha 😂
octobre 24 ?
Noxus sent a pregnant woman into war. Savages
So Katarina, Ambessa, Pantheon, Kindred and who was the other one? Swain?
Really out here thinking it was BTS BS&T 🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭
another black character, another african vibes, make polish, straight, sigma once next time. this is getting boring
Wow, they released a absolute banger simply for a skinline, also all the designs looks cool asf, Swain, Ambessa, Pantheon, Kindred, Kata, all of them look way too good in the skinline design.
Поражаюсь все больше и больше их синематикам просто класс снимаю шляпу 👍🔥
Очередной феминизм, заебали
Sem palavras para descrever o quanto tem alma em um jogo
this song is better for Worlds than Heavy is the crown tbh
FODA PRA KRL <3 ADOREI!!!
LoL Songs never disappoint us, I wish game didnt asw
@Necrit! do the thing! :D
sim, queremos um filme sobre noxus e suas milhares de invasões hahaha
Riot can you stop deliver all the acustic kids in my team in every ranked game? Thanks!
bruh fortiche making the whole season 2 of arcane AND a new music video, they are smashing it
If this isn’t an Ambessa Medarda origin story, I’ll eat my shoe.
Why is riot spamming black champs? lol they are woke af
quite good  game for a music company....
ABSURDO.
월즈 뮤비를 좀 이렇게 만들지 에휴
This is crazy
i can tell someone at riot watched the trash show about the warrior queen on netflix
So here is where it went all the animators budget from the worlds song lmao
İs that Katarina on the back
The animation is just gorgeous
Now we know why there's a bad Worlds anthem video, it's because they did another bad music video.
TB Skien's 'bout to lose his entire mind.
Ambessa Really about to relive this moment with Warwick🐺
Not in Spotify ?
Riot u gotta make that big hulky golden armor guy a champ
Is riot allergic to music that isnt imagine dragon clones?
Sounds great!!!
when is Fortiche replacing production for every piece of League media?
Maybe I'm behind on League lore to fully appreciate the music video, however the song is pretty lit!
Necrit do the thing
Ambessa is wonderful!
i still hate ambessa ingame
another anger problem character
MELS MOM IS A WARRIOR
Andddddd it is black.
THIS SSSSOOO GOOOODDDD
Blood Sweat and Tears huh...sounds like my regular ranked experience.
I love how this reminds me of "Woman King." They clearly researched on African themes and made something of their own. Really well done Riot
this really is a banger
Is she pregnant (rell) ?
0:23 she's pregnant here??
Is Mount Targon the next region after Arcane?
Spotify?
GOD HOW DID YOU MAKE ME CRY AT just 0:30 SECOND OF A VIDEO???? (If you are watching this video after the necrit video, this scene should be at minute 23:40 in his video) And she crying to the child holding another sheep, that -  I understud as - his daughter... cause they will die togheter if Ambessa doesn't struggle for her life... Ught. Perfection.  I'm also thrilled that Riot and Fortiche chose to portray death through a cultural lens, incorporating both animated and cultural references. It's fantastic to see how the concept of the 'Reaper' embodied by the sheep and wolf changes to match with religions that don't focus on death as an individual experience. This is why dying as a Shuriman is a communal ritual involving dance, music, a mediator, and the presence of other departed souls.  Noxus, drawing inspiration from Rome, emphasizes anthropocentrism and individualism, reflecting modern values rooted in Greco-Roman culture. However, Ambessa's perspective on death is distinctly different. Even in her solitary battle against the wolf, she draws strength from her ancestors. It's Ambessa's ancestors who give her strength, literally undoing the lamb made to die without fighting in what is what will make her alive.  In religions/cultures of African matrix, death is a collective experience and that's why connecting with the dead can only be done through rituals that involve many people. Ambessa is not only Shuriman, but also she is not Noxian, thats why death is white-golden and dark-red in different moments. It's a very sensitive way of approaching how cultures interact without canceling each other out.  Notice she's already pregnant, her hand resting on her belly instead of the arrow. As she 'gains life', her daughter also awakens. It's intriguing that Ambessa turns her scars into gold post-battle, yet they don't manifest physically. Could the magic of facing death and returning have altered Mel, causing her scars to become corporeal?  Arcane has a remarkable ability to elevate everything it touches.
RIOT STUDIOS!!!!!!
Wtf? Ok it's time to stop playing League of Legends.
Reasons why i Love League Songs is because it tells so much story
incredible, this video has more lore than shaco
What did she grab to get that Shurima powers?
Meh, I've seen more better lol music
Its not that deep bro. Worst you get is hand cramps
I don't go here, but 😍
Animacion 8/10 cancion 4/10 ya no lo hacen como antes
2025?!
Mlbb : Hhmm... new animation Check and copy
Top tier storytelling, as always
NECRIT I NEED YOU RIGHT NOW!!!
im in love
kinda hype ngl
3:25 4 shadows behind what could it be
I really thought this was the VA of ambessa herself lol
This is an amazing video. Artists are just gorgeous.  Music is great as well. But I feel like Kindred here are much more epic and interesting than Ambessa herself
no entendi ni mierdas
the point of this video?
Omg different black hairstyle?? No killmonger hairstyle??
I'm glad the guy who designed ambessa got laid off from riot
That explains why she has so many dashes
Absolute banger
PEAK Fortiche Studio 2Y for that is by far enought
Aight, this is pantheon level chadistic energy, but the fact remains that she's a problem on her release, and everyone saw it a hundred miles away.
I was looking for a new wallpaper and thanks to this I am spoiled for choice.
WE LOVE AN AMAZING LGBTQ REPRESENTATION!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩 her lore got me weak it’s amazing
ai no jogo parece um rework da shyvana kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk fecha as portas riot, ja deu pra vcs.
this is cinema
im ready for a 2 hour tbskyen vid
Could be a hot take, but this feels more like a worlds song than what Linkin Park did.
Who's excited to see Ambessa get a launch legendary and Kindred get none for the last 8 years?
Im.. im not feeling it riot.. Ever since heavy is the crown im not feeling it anymore. It doesnt feel like the old league of legends anymore :(
sick
KATARINAAAAAAAAAA
Hope I don’t die of old age before they make the MMO. There’s so much potential.
Wait there's no Linkin Park in this MV
necrit where are you??
TRUE DAMAGE COMEBACK WHEN??
Ta cheirando a champion broken
No entendí nada :(
só faz merda cara pqp
This makes it seem even more likely that Mel would survive in Season 2, given she was granted some sort of strange blessing since she was in her mother's womb?
amazing
Now Riot has to make all the champions music videos where they sing. I WANT TEEMO SINGING NEXT!!!!
Please if by any chance you got shot by an arrow, DO NOT take it out like Ambessa did, your blood gonna spilled like a waterfall and cause severe bleeding, the arrow help a bit to block blood from coming out, just call an ambulance.
wow.
When will it be released on Spotify?
will we see the three leader of noxus? (Swain, Darius and LB)
Riot legit making Disney villain songs for their champions now
Ambessa is big!
GOD
Much better than the Worlds music video 💀
блять, зачем.
more satanic messages that are hidden
the art style and direction on these has gone backwards from a few years ago, you guys had this stuff perfected what happened?
is this what acid feels like?
This music video revealed the new outfit of Ambressa, Pantheon, Swain and Katarina
I thought it was BTS for a moment
This is a nice intro to the new champ. Forreals.
I summoned thee hear my call lore master Necrit.
poneme la cancion mas generica que tengas... No! no taaan generica! Una mierda la musica. Podrias intercambiar el audio con cualquier otro trailer y seria exactamente lo mismo. Parece generada por inteligencia artificial la musica. UNA VRGA!
Wonder how she feels about Kled
Ok Necrit, we are all waiting for the one hour long video. cmon man
Прям инклюзивная херня. Новый персонаж прям по всем правилам чёрная женщина в возрасте независимая и сильная. Ну да, у на дреды носят только люди определённого цвета кожи. Плюс их поведение, что Релл , что эта новая "персонажиня". При этом есть же хорошие персонажи Люциан, Сенна, Пайк. Ну судя по комментариям  большинство тут людей "хавают". Печально.
뭘 말하고 싶은건데?
Slave on fire
I wonder how many people who worked on this were laid off before it even released?
That’s a new skinline isn’t
AAAAAAKWKWHEYWWHEJFHFHSHSSHSKSBDJAJDWHDJHWJEVEJEB
This is so awesome
The storytelling is S tier. I cried.
4:20...nice
They set such a high bar that this is like imop the worst song they put out in years and it's still good so that's saying how consistently good they are
Wolves by Kanye West
nhac ngu vc
安比薩擁有一隻完整的MV，但T1卻要跟Linkin Park共用一支MV。
STOP THIS IS SO GOOD! I loved Ambessa character the first time I saw her and this video is amazing
shes so cool
C'est exceptionnel, bravo pour ce travail, je trouve ça magnifique !!!
like and comment
I'm a simple man. I see Pantheon, I like the video
Ooh LoL and Fortiche is really playing with some interesting themes of motherhood and sacrifice in this one. Really looking forward to see how Ambessa is going to react in Arcane season 2!
FINALLY WE SEE SWAIN IN A LORE CINEMATIC 🙏 I hope they give us some references to him in Arcane
Это потрясающе!!!!!❤❤❤
Sheryl Lee Ralph performed this song, wow.
Kindred is real goat
THE LORE GOES CRAZY I LOVE IT MORE OF THIS RIOT PLEASE
you can really feel the story within the video and the music! this is truely epic
2:32 Titan Warlock Hunter
the woke we accepted !
KINDREDDDDD OMG THEY LOOK AMAZING
그 와중에 복근 보소... 캬..... 저거궈든
Na Pita nunmul??
1:23 "COME, FIGHT ME. SO I CAN RISE ONCE MORE" lookin ahh  "THE BEST CLIMBERS KNOW HOW TO FALL."
forgot to put a "," after Blood
After seeing Ambessa's lifesteal: Tears, Tears, only Tears
Can someone make a wallpaper engine of this XD 3:31
Battle of Thermopylae, spartan inspiration
Considering there's the Arcane "A" symbol in the thumbnail for this... I wonder if this is significant to Arcane afterall.
Ambezzza
Goosebumps all of the time 🥰🥰🥰 THX RITO 💜💜💜
Por um segundo pensei que fosse BTS
I can't wait to see people's reaction to this
im in love bro
What engine dose riot use for there animations?
Tiene tanto protagonismo este personaje, digan de una vez que es mejor amiga de Mordekaiser y la abuela de Darius
Dang mel really has it easy
When I seen the title I was thinking BTS blood sweat and tears for a moment 😅
O que que aconteceu aqui??
Is this before or after Singed Nuked Ionia.
I've been tired of League of Legends for years, but the quality of the videos, both the clips and the arcane series, still blows me away.
why this magic lady remind me of mel in arcane ? 2:43
내 피 땀 눈물~
3:38 she was pregnant ?
If I had a nickel for every time I have asked myself " what military commander thought it was a good idea to bring a very pregnant woman to a warzone" in a video game related thing, I'd have three nickels which is starting to feel silly.
bts
Foda pra caralho!!!!!!!!
Wakanda ?
Wow this is another unbeatable level 😮
we needed this after the world song
Katarina and Swain in the back ?
🔥🔥🔥
Wait a second, did wolf impregnate her with a demon baby at 3:38 ?
We're definitely getting Noxus for next series
is it just me or did Ambessa dash 655217862138 times in that MV?
Mmm I’m confuse clear the arrow that she was hit are noxiang. I thought it was something like shurima vs no ya. But then when she stood up. Her clothes are noxian too. WTF the background that happen there?
I won't watch it because I wanna keep the surprise for when the second season is out. But the  30 first seconds were breathtaking.
so much work in music videos... fix ur match making
wtf is going on
this is a very solid song the lore the action the visuals GG people!
There's something inherently racist about this I'm black by the way and I can feel the energy
slaaaay
This is exactly how all the DEI promoters see themselves including all kind of uselles alphabet bs in games nowadays and I feel this was made by and for those kind of people. A whole lot of random bs thrown at you so fast that you understand nothing out of it. Kinda cool music tho.
Wow... just, wow🫨
BTS
al principio ni entendí y al final tampoco
Wow,amazing
😮❤🔥
This clip will make a lot of players stop playing league of legends. No one can handle it anymore with the stereotype of "Strong black woman". The future of this game is dark.
banger
Here since Day 1
Bts???
i think she forgot that she had a passive, i didnt see her dash once, must be an iron ambessa
the song and animation are pretty good but the champ is still cringe af
Eu sem entender porra nenhuma
meh, It's hard to listen these nword lyrics
2h T.B skyen video inbound
this is cool and all but.. this has more story telling than the current Worlds Anthem video where it should've been showing us T1 journey last year.
20th time listening to this, I love it omg
Nah se pasaron, que bueno.
This is 🤌
That wolf was hot
now woke legends ???
So this small indie company casually perfected water animation for the intro of a music video before Hollywood, got it.
with this treasure i summon @necrit the big lore explainer
Cringe
This was so over produced.. Too much useless and weird symbolism.. is it because shes black.. Like Idk from the lyrics and everything this was just very.. Ehhh.. but hey.. Riot
bro if Kindred aren't legendary in this one I'm genuinenly gonna cry
самое худшее видео от лиги ппц шляпа полная как так то раньше делали такие сочные видосы а сейчас жесть полная ....
Jinx is playing agnist too much
This is one of the sickest music videos I have ever seen
Entendi nada, mas hype
epic
I so cannot wait for Arcane...
Masterpiece
why every black character have the same haricut hahahahahahhahahaha
So Shurima connection confirmed! Edit: Wish there was CC for this 😢
Alright Necrit i'm waiting
wakanda forever XD
zzzzzzzzzzzzzz
el final muy incoherente... al sacar una flecha que esta dentro del cuerpo, se tiene mas probabilidades de morir por el sangrado interno... si quieren hablar sobre sobrevivir, creo deberian de pulir mucho ese detalle para que coincida con lo que tratan de expresar.
Black female human fighting toe to toe against Pantheon? Did she win? Unclear. When she wakes up, she got the courage to remove the arrow. Kindred gave her strength? Unclear. She is so strong she stood up on her own. Riot rubs me way off in these undertones.
If ambessa joins True Damage or the like, we NEED to get Sheryl back in the studio. Perfect casting doesnt even scratch the surface of what this is
피 땀 눈물 이잖아
when is it coming out on spotify?
Музыка не понравилась. Отстой короче
Absolute Cinema
Kindred ?????????????????????
For some reason i feel happy just because my main(pantheon) defeated the new champion in the lore  'Pantheon is truly broke '
KSI reference 1:19
хуйня какая-то, я не понял
Im not kidding, this is one of the coolest things they released recently holy moly
Wtf ?
I love this!  And so she got pregnant... and kindred is the father.. okay
kindred way too cool
Just a dumb advice you are better off with the arrows stuck inside of you than pulling it out like that. 3:44
Anyone think this might be a slight backstory to Ambessa Medarda from arcane?
This is so hype, why was this not LOL worlds song
Der Champion vom Design schon wieder eine Frechheit, aber Promo können die bei Riot richtig gut.
Sold her soul for power obviously the good guys
litteraly who character from noxus got her own song not bad not bad
Bro vaya mierda de canción🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wtf this looks more like Shurima than Noxus
Another banger
so basically arcana but an extra steps?
My first interpretation is that there are 2 versions of Ambessa  in the video. One fighting the wolf to survive and the other trying to save her child. In the end, Ambessa is given a choice to save herself or the child.
u gotta love Kindred
AMBESSA VS PANTHEON?
Don't spend so much money on character videos and pay a lot of attention to making the LOL World Cup music video. The 2024 winner is just Linkin Park. 캐릭터 영상에 이렇게 돈쓰지말고 롤드컵 뮤비 제작할때나 좀 신경을썻으면 얼마나좋아. 2024년 우승자는 그냥 린킨파크야.
Fortiche nails it yet again! love these guys!
Necrit, your turn
THIS IS AMAZIIINNNG 🥹😭
zzzz
Ksante 2.0 looks dope
Are all black champions gonna be broken?
This why they decided to give her 1 million dashes?
Wou
Excited for the 30 min Necrit video!
ambessa era uma targonense? parece que ela era da tribo dos solaris, mas apos perder pra noxianos e sobreviver, mudou de lado. É o que eu acho
what a dogshit
League of Blacks
Absolutamente cinema
It would be much better to leave the arrow inside, than to pull it out like that, wtf rito you should know that
I love it
3:55: "...SK TELECOM MAKES DAT 2 MAYBE 3 KILLSSSS..."
Waiting for necrit!
이런게 진짜 주인공을 명확하게 조명해주는 뮤직비디오지
Absolute masterpiece!
WOW. panth looks so cool.
Riot, it's gonna be hard but don't fail the prestige Swain of this skinline. Thanks.
I'm on a mushroom trip, and the Riot Games animations have totally captivated me.
I'm on a mushroom trip, and the Riot Games animations have totally captivated me.
Okay I have no clue whats going on in this video... and the song is not as good as Id like it to be although I love the voice... it just doesnt hype me up...
what's camavinga doing in riot mvs now 💀
KINDREEED ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
이렇게 만들 수 있는데 왜 월즈 곡은.....
agnus konstantin korobov reference ?
Not me thinking it’s the BTS versions of Blood Sweat and Tears 💀
Isso ai é arte filho, slk. Ta difícil controlar as espectativas pra Arcane
bts?
이게 뭔데 월즈 뮤비보다 더 퀄이 좋냐....
So Ambessa, Swain, Panth and Kata new lore skinline (+Kindred ?)
Bravo!!
is this talk about ambessa ?
Worst character thus far :S epic cringe moment
tf, pulling the arrow out like that without proper first-aid is kinda guarantee bleeding to death
THOSE ABS YOU COULD MAKE AN FRIED EGG ON IT!
If an alien asked me what art is I would show them this
I love all the lore and Arcane, but it's so sad League itself just isn't my jam. 😢
I haven't broken down in tears of awe like this in a long time.  Thanks for that, Riot.
Necrit please
That’s my barbara
Não entendi foi nada
This could work well as the background music of one of those meme wolf ripping his shirt pics, super edgy
2049
wait, so Ambessa isn't born Noxian??? She's Shuriman???
q bosta
ambessa siempre te vi bien 🫦
Now I know why the world MV is baf
is that shot at the end a fetus? was she pregnant with mel or what?
they keep getting worse
My main
who is she ?
What is this ksi typa music
Digo e repito Matriarca da Guerra é uma alcunha do CA-RA-LHO! Já sou main.
I love the lore. I am wondering why is she pregnant in the battle? That makes no sense unless it is some kind of ambush or unexpected fight.
Wait this was SO SICK!!! Could’ve convinced me we got another Worlds Anthem! 😂
Remember guys, Blitzcrank still slows himself.
Necrit, explain whats happening here. Fast.
fix your game
Achei q fosse BTS ( o nome da música parece KKKKKK)
I saw the title of the video and I thought BTS? XD Anyone STAN? ❤
I thought Its BTS’s song
I love that last shot of Ambessa clutching her belly, due to both her wound and the baby she carries.
Идеально, как и всегда
3:29 I can see Pantheon, Swain and Katarina  am i right ?
Wait? Is this sang by the Elder Teacher, Barbara Howard, from Abbot Elementary?
젊은 암베사 느낌있는데 그냥 이렇게 내면 안되냐 늙어버린 암베사는 좀.... 젊은남자 섹드립치는게 할카스같음
Anyone else have their eyes water when they see something so unbelievably cool? Or am I weird. Loved every frame of this animation. The textures, the choreography, and the music too, all came together so beautifully.
“we needed a song quick before worlds opening ceremony so we made this garbage”
Reminds me of the wolf meme lmfao
ауф
This is cool and all but you don't just pull out an arrow stuck in you lol. That super cliché act  kinda ruins the video.
Once again Riot Games and Fortiche are killing it
This Panteon looks like big golden rock on the blood's sea
I like the music~ Its been so long since I've heard a heart retching song!
kindred legendary i beg
hey let Fortiche do the World Anthem!! you are wasting their talent. meh forget it after all Linkin Park won last year's championship right?
As a 2 year kindred main I am so happy with how kindred is everywhere in league right now!
Now this is how you promote a new champion 👏
hyped 🔥
The Lamb within her is gone. All that remains is The Wolf.
The only thing wilder than this video will be the Necrit video
4 min music video but the stuff in the background could be a movie
Soo like, what happens in the video? Like i play from 2009 and see only black woman being abused then being super stronk ... wat? Only familiar face is Kindred if you can call it a face
marvecc dawaj analize, analiza machen
Another Fortiche masterclass, so proud of my country
BTS reference on fire
This. This is how you write and show a powerful character with a rich storied background. Amazing work!
ohmyfuckinggodambessa!!!!!!!
Congrats riot games, finally we have good champion teasers again ! hope u guys continue.
so good
"every dream has meaning"  the dream:
noxian kindred. LIT
Que saudade que eu  estava de uma boa cinemática  , agora que arcane terminou , já podemos esperar grandes cinemáticas novamente 🎉
I see swain kat and pantheon
not gonna lie that was bad for riot
3:18 that bass line gave me shivers!
BIG MOMMA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
making a side-project called "League of Legends" was indeed a smart move from Riot to promote their music products
THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL! RIOT STEPPING IT UP!
Better than worlds mv
The opposite of a banger
Sex00 pudor uhhh lagrimas! me da igual.. shudaramdirum daaam
🔥🔥🔥
If Panth's shield doesn't actually do that, I'm going to be so pissed.
차라리 저 금색 디자인으로 출시했으면 개지렸을듯
awesome
BABE WAKE UP NEW LORE JUST DROPPED
🔥
IT kind of looks like Mel somehow kept Ambessa alive when she was about to be taken by lamb&wolf. Mel 100% coming to league and is still alive. The symbolism here is insane
ja só main fdsss
WHOAAAA
It is so sool to see the exact same Ionian beach from Swain art, they both were among the few survivors of that battle. Not quite sure if there was where swain also lost his hand, if it is true then Irelia was also there. In Arcane they seem to be enemies or at least political rivals, so it would be cool to see Ambessa joining Leblanc, same as Samira sparked her interest and get a future story arc for nexus civil war. Perhaps Arcane 3? Who knows.
Pantheon 💪💪🔥🔥🔥🔥
Its always the ni9999er as MC in this WOKE LOL game
crappy black song, sounds garbage
nice
what
Hello??? Still waiting for k/da to have a comeback
DEI
Bravo
blood sweat e tears não é tipo, uma música do BTS?
baby killer
Well well well, this is what Lamb was talking about, us being more in the spotlight. Im pleased.
Better than 2024worlds Mv
Ambessa’s origin story is cool
십알룐들아? 할줄아네? 노래 부르는 싱어는 언제 나오냐?
Nhạc này ra vì mục đích gì vậy
Nossa tipo assim, em anos esse é um dos melhores video do lol que eu ja vi. Tem tantos conceitos que eu nem sei por onde começar, simplesmente eu amei ❤
im in love with this
collab with BTS? 🤨🧐🤣
TEMAZO!!!
*better than worlds music cof cof*
WE WUZ ASCENDED AND SHIEEEEEET
Arcade’s story tree from Zaun up to piltower,now the leaves fly to noxus
conserta os bugs do jogo pelo amor de Deus
New champion fighting with Pantheon okay cool
Está canción es muy olvidable, parece una copia de una copia de varias canciones de los anteriores años, !!que descarados¡¡
ทำดีค่ะ สมกับเป็นค่ายเพลง
Necrit will cook with this
wait is that a kindred??
Waiting for the 35+ min Necrit video
Of course, the video is addictive, I like the embodiment of death in LOL.
riot cooking extra crispy with the animation and music
como um video desse não tem legenda?  mds
Сервера почините!
música generica de PC gamer. innoven. este mismo estilo de música lo traen desde hace varios años en mundiales.
já vi melhores em rito
Mẹ thằng rito làm mv world 2023 như cứt
CARALHOOOOW, sinto uma expansão de lore sinistra vindo por ai
This is much better than Heavy is the Crown, video and music..
Haven’t played league in years, I always stay updated on the lore tho. Feeling blessed these past couple years with arcane and these mvs 🙏
❤  Queen
A RIOT VOLTOU A TRABALHAR FAMÍLIA
So Kindred shows up and shows Ambessa the current incarnation of the aspect of war (not Pantheon cause it looks like he still stands with the gods) is willing to train her and where this path leads. Ambessa pays Kindred for this chance with her "innocence". Innocence being the lamb she was trying to protect a metaphor for her child. Who seems to now be a host maybe for Kindred. This is probably why she cries at the sight of the lamb she is holding. Once this ritual and communion is complete the now host baby wakes her from the communion state and she goes to walk the path she has chosen. That path probably being a warrior of the gods.
Sublime
Kindred?? I cant believe it!
Can’t wait for the two hour Necrit and Skyen videos on this four minute music video 😂
JUST MORE WOKE PROPAGANDA BS RIOT IS PUSHING.
All these songs are so similar, every time, even the melody is almost identical to imagine dragons.
kalite yerlerde 0 hype var oyun için
entendi foi nada
Beautiful, but in the meantime, the client remains horrible.
Nghi thức thăng hoa chăng ?
as always on top. Videos from RiotGames the best, even though I don't play League anymore.
Very very interesting to see the baby having glowing eyes. Was it just a representation of its potential and desire to live on or was it an actual Arcane lore hint that Mel literally has shuriman magic in her and that's where her golden ornaments/tattoos come from
Riot music videos so good, everything. And fortiche animation, peak.
Increible, que belleza!
Thank you RIOT for reignited my spark! this content has been fantastic with the representations! Now i have a new cosplay to plan!
염병 ㅋㅋㅋ 롤드컵 뮤비나 잘만들지
so what youre saying is, we were really close to not having this champion if she had just died on that beach?
That skinline and that music video is just perfect
*Takes Sip* Needs More League of Legends
showing mel in the womb is crazy
이정도로 할수있으면서 페이커헌정곡에 나온 선수들의 얼굴은 저따구로 해놨냐 진짜 🤦
Ну такое...
1k dislike already is crazy, this is some of the biggest quality from riot since Still here
What an absolute Queen 👑
?
I hope someday a Noxus series with this visual style, the lore of Zaun and Piltover is not bad but Noxus must be epic if they include even Mordekaiser
какое говнище
This is gonna do a number on TbSyken lol
This is getting added to the workout playlist!!!!!
Best new character trailer?
Better than the Worlds Song, unironically.
that's the worst animation i've ever seen riot produced.
Duermanme y despiertenme en noviembre
What the D.E.I is this?
Her singing her own history of how she became this General is amazing
BTS just isnt the same after military service...
no words, too good
what ascendant does she become?
이거 말고 월즈 뮤비나 내놓으라고
At first I didn't understand anything, but as I continued watching I got the point, even more so at the end with the appearance of Kindred and the revelation of Ambessa being pregnant. I can't wait for this champion to come out so I can play it.
Banger!
What a powerful woman
1:25 pantheon reowrk 2025 XD
I didn't see a single white character throughout the entire video. Cool.
Целому персонажу клип? Это потому что она чёрная?
I was here
No idea what's going on here (but I'm on my way to find out). Still, like always, the music and the animation is on point and beautiful!
napittamnumnul... I had a stroke from reading the title, and prosessing what the song would be like
Muhteşemmm <3
good song and animation but fix your stupid game
this is amazing
Looove thiis! ❤
Someone comment the story to us who don't get it 😂😂
omg SWAIN! <3
Sheryl Lee Ralph god tier voice
❤️‍🔥
Cookery right here
better than heavy is the crown
This was beautiful
SOME ONE CALL NECRIT PLEASE!!!!!!!!!
meh
Uga buga, wakanda forever
Achei uma merda...
ya paren con el wokee plizzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Fortiche the goat of all time.
Mordekaiser needs to be in that skinline !!!!
So like KINDRED??? I Love this
Мурашки по коже, молодцы!
yikes
How generic do you want it to be? Yes
seloco deu ate vontade de ouvir a musica do bts pelo nome
This is 10,000 times better than the Linking Park video. Riot should re-make world anthem for this year.
Kindred is always a refrence
Bro this video during 4:20 🌿🌿💚✌️😎
We need more yordles on the cinematics
You never pull out an arrow, but other than that that was nice
Por la barba de zelean que alguien le suba el sueldo a los artistas de riot
KATARINAAA!!!
DEI? LGBTQ? BLM?
This is gorgeous omg
summoning necrit and tb skyen for the multi hour analyses tyvm
what is going on people ? why first charakter woman caracteristic and man chest what is this why explain ?
Barbra Howard is a teacher that has bars for days!! Amazing music/video
She looks like a female version of miles morales.
그러고보니 암바사 요새 편의점에서 파나?
I font know something feals odd with the video i don sence the love the usualy put on as in previos ones
Hold up is she pregnant?
Riots logic is funny sometimes, we have these cool demon looking creatures perfectly fit to be a champion in the game, makes another diverse human.
por qué despidieron al creador de Ambessa? Deberían haber despedido al que dio visto bueno y decidió que saliera oficialmente.
Marvecc, czekamy na analize :D
做得比冠軍mv還要好看
It’s times like this I forget that I don’t like to play League of Legends and I think maybe I should try it again and then I realize that this video is just describing solo queue lol. Well done on the artwork and music. I look forward to watching the next season of arcane!
Poor black woman lol they are already not great for the world of flirting but they are represented as virile men lol
No one seeing the kindred tie in?
Still team Jinx
"I was raised by wolves. I was born to lead" ⚔️🔥 best intro ever
ONe of the best music videos i have ever seen!!
I love how they even made a Box Office Series as her champion showcase
better than heavy is the crown =)))
looooooooooooooooooooooooooooove,  whoever was the creative team on this you blew this out of the water this was beautiful
So much to unpack here: She's on an Ionian beach fighting in the Noxian war on Ionia; when she is on the brink of death her soul gets pulled into what appears to be 3 different afterlifes: The domain of the kindred (testing her worthiness for the lamb's respite), Mordekaiser's Death realm (another potential member of the army of the damned - her home of noxus), and a shuriman xerath cultist afterlife (pulled by her lineage - blood connection). (Fairly certain these are xerath cultists due to A). environment, B). their attire (They very closely resemble xerath cultists from LoR cards), and C). corrupting the lamb's gift (inducing a pregnancy towards some eventual end goal).  This isn't even a fourth of all the pieces I hope Necrit unpacks!
What a piece of pure garbage
Riot is just mogging the music and audiovisual industry atp and I'm so here for it
Que fumada acabo de ver?!?
Wow Ambessa is such a badass character. Thank you Arcane!
根本就音樂公司
did weibo gaming even try, lol why not ban 1 x jax. or pick him.. why pick yone if u are bad at it, didnt get weibo but anyways knew they would lose.
At least it sounds more pleasing to the ears than the previous MV, but overall it's worse than previous years :\
idk i dont feel the hype
Wait what is the arbitrer from shadowlanda duing here
TBskyen on his way to make a 1 or 2 hour video analysis Necrit might make a 35 or 45 minute video (is my prediction)
I wonder. Is the baby mel? If it is, then her eyes opening to be gold might be that both ambessa and mel received the kindreds blessing.
i love it!
Alch mejor arreglen su pinche juego en lugar de hacer videos piteros, además esa negra que? En sus diálogos trata como iguales a Darius y swain y ni hablar de sus habilidades, también ya cambien su estilo musical, desde el 2020 toda su pinche música se escucha igual
할말이 많지만.. 넘어가자..
And so it begins. Not only will we see characters from the game appear in Arcane, but we will also start to see new characters from Arcane be added to the game. This was the vision for Overwatch that Jeff Kaplan failed to keep up.
riot se vocês fizessem o jogo igual fazem cinemática ia ser incrível
They never disappoint me with the creativity in their songs
я в истории?
Why is the logo red?
Riot music and animation as always top tier. Now if they only could stop doing massive layoffs every 2 months...
不同遊戲的動畫嗎?  跟LOL有什麼關係? 這季兩個MV都好醜 下一季加油好嗎?
ＤＥＩ。。。。。ｆｋ
where's necrit when we need him NECRITTTTT
Agenda 2030 champ
Eu amei, vai pro meu Spotify
Me encanto
can't wait for necrit to cover all the background lore
Average toplane experience
wonder how many of the artists that worked on this got laid off :/
noxus doesnt provide maternity leave 😔
meeh
Spotify?
Bruh this cinematic creator isn't a human
0:22 Bangalore??? What are you doing in League of legends?
I thought it was BTS' song lol
Click on my comment twice to see the magic
It might be the music video with the best art design I've ever seen in my life. Great respect...
better than the worlds anthem.
time to perma ban
Is this song on spotify
At the end the baby could be mel,maybe that means that the golden flash at the end of the first season was this kind of weird kindred power
Necrit please i dont understand anything help me
Always exceeding my already high expectations. Beautiful and powerful! The entire team deserves all our praise.
uma vibe meio rei leao né?🦁
All this just to be banned every game until she's nerfed.
weird video
Why can't Faker's videos be made with this level of quality?
Why was this so much better than the worlds 2024 song?
BTS?
Godlike vibes! Amazing!
kindred is so goatedddd my favorite character
xun's kindred.
I like “Heavy is the Crown” but THAT would have been a so much better Worlds song!
Does that mean that Ambessa sacrified her daughter and this confirms that "Mel" is actually Karma and she's alive in season 2?
A black character again
아 여기다 에너지 쓰느라 월즈 영상이 저렇게 된거였구나..?
First time I see a proper use of AI resources, fit so well
As soon as Kindred gives the wolf artifact, she had made a decision. The lamb desitegrates into the wolf totem out of the scrars from childhood. She takes the place of the pantheon like inner boss. Blood sweat and tears is all I know.
优秀的作评:)
I’ve never played this game and never will until it’s remade as a AAA title. But their music videos are just lit! 🔥
la cancion muy bonita, pero... Y crear un campeon tan culero era necesario
Amazing!! 🔥🔥🙌🙌
dei music video
Another bamger from from Riot games, a music production company.
idk if its only me but it sounds like AI xd
It's neither good nor bad song for me   It's not going to be one of the best but it's not going to be the worst song in the game either
Bro i though this mv make by BTS ...
블랙걸이라 잘내주고 옐로우몽키라고 인종차별당한건가 페이커
always thought the wolf motif was more of a darius thing
В конце ролика глупость какая-то: вынув стрелу она  быстрее бы  умерла от потери крови. Тем более она воин и такое не знать...к создателю ролика вопросы
Ambessa is such an interesting character, this video just made things even better for her. Love it!
Not watched yet. But bet its cringe.
2:33 MERCEDES?
bts ahh title
Powerful
If ya’ll look closely, they put some snippet & reference on season 2 character. Some snippet of sevika, a reference to VI and viktor, some form ok VI, etc.
wait what? was she trained by shurima ascended o.O non of these can dash as much as she can now
in 3:37, we see a baby, it's possible that this baby was the reason why she wake up? like, it's possible that she was pregnant in that moment? we don't know this exactly, but seeing that she wakes up from "Death" after seeing a baby, it's possible that this is why she values her family so much in her voicelines
Why do we have Etretat's cliff in background at the end ?
This is a disney villain song I LOVE IT
So that is actually pantheon and  not some other targonian warrior
1:23 soy ese
Masterclass
Every time someone dislikes this comment, i will check it again 💀
Better than Heavy is the crown
Fortiche is simply build different
At first i thought is gonna be cringe but i didnt expact that! Its incredible!!
FIRE OH MY GOD I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
@marvecc ????
this video itself got many worlds co-stream partners on copyright strike
Alright
wow....
The voice of Sheryl lee Ralph is magical! I'm in awe!
3:51 이 수평적이고 무릎 정도 높이의 이미지는 꽤나 새로운 향기네요
lançar clip e fácil... quero ver laçar uma correção para todos os bugs q tem no jogo e deixar o game "BOM"....
Ufff qué joya, se viene Ambessa y..... Habrá rework de Pantheon...?
Don't worry a female version of Kante can't hurt you...  Well that didn't aged well
아니;; 티원 우승 뮤비를 이렇게 만들었어야지
pos ok
That's the most incoherent nonsense I've ever seen.
Mercedes-Benz Pantheon confirmed.
Whole life story in ONE VIDEO .
Yh they cooked again
THIS MORE LIKE A WORLD SONG! WE WOULDA GOT THIS BANGER INSTEAD OF ....
Que guay ahora
Wakanda?
After all these years, Kindred receive the recognition they deserve <3
This is necrit's wet dream video
I'd let a comment here, so I can re watch the video whenever someone gives it a like.
Tooo much goin on with NO context and hella odd imagery….. very not fun haha league cinematics been goin DownHill for the last 2 years or so now Jesus
THIS COULD BE HINTING SOMETHING, THE CHILD IF THAT'S 100% MEL SHE WOULD HAVE POWERS OMG
at 0:45 I like how wolf looked at her belly then looked back at her It painted a picture of judgment and how she will fight for the unborn child
Мяу  ©26.10.2024
So Ambessa has connections to the Solari but fights for Noxus, which was already hinted in Arcane where her daughter wore a Solari dress in a scene in the past. On a further note, her daughter seem to have aquired powers too, opening her shining golden eyes in the scene in the womb, similar to how she started to shine gold when Jinx rocket impacted at the end off arcane
better than world anthem 2024 =)))
I can't believe Riot made an entire game and esports scene from this lore, the dedication
You’d actually get less hate if you labeled this the world’s 2024 anthem LOL
wow
Necrit! We summon you! Your time is nigh!
viola davis is that you? the woman king from LoL
I think the lamb symbolizes innocence, as if she was clinging to her own innocence, and then the wars kinda of tear apart that innocence little by little until Ambessa almost dies on the battlefield and loses that innocence forever. Like, now she's made of iron, and she really has to be since she was pregnant with Mel.   but yes, the lamb could also represent her children and her having to give up this vulnerability that  children bring, as the clip could also represent this vulnerability being explored and used against her, maybe that's why she almost died in the first place. In the series she makes it veeeery clear that she feels that her children make her weak.
So unbelievably good. This singer knocked it out of the park. The animation is straight up Arcane quality too.
seeing riot actually utilize the wolf more than the lamb here in a completely different look than usual actually gives me some semblance of hope that they arent completely boned
i dont like that it is more a music video then backround infos about the champ. Your videos should tell a story i want cinematics
chills!
use your dashes back to africa lobotomy designer
Spartacus that's all im gonna say..
My new favorite song in league
I wouldn't mind if Arcane S2 just decided to become a musical half way through the season. Holy her voice is amazing
The animator plays a lot of miniatures and NMM skill is his/her favorite.
smells like woke trash
Cavaleiros do Zodíaco  kkkk "Amazonas" né??? Hehe
Guys, I did not get it. May you narrate it to me?
I feel that, other than the Kindred, that lamb also represents Ambessa’s innocence being crushed. Beautiful.
booooooooooooooooooo
Nice to see a young Ambessa
Pretty but bland overall. It's sad to imagine what they could do with such art and animation, but it has to please the most and be as bland as Disney movies...
que fodar.
OH MY GOD i have never felt this constant goosebump in a cinematic never! THIS WAS PEAK!
wow! woke and dei, ty rito
literally meh..
Riot is just music company now
YOU GUYS GOT SHERYL LEE RALPH? I LOVE HER SM
WE WANT KDA
love how this is in Noxus and Katarina is there but no sight of Talon... who should be...
bro, cool animation, but now i want to know who got her pregnant
CHERYL LEE RALPH?!??
ESTA ES AMBESSA?
Absolute cinema 🙌🙌
Okay she's a badass
apaga o smolder e faz esse lobo do inicio no lugar dele rito
Nope
Is she PREGNANT?
A fitting music video for a 400 years champ.
I'll have to go back to lol
I don't think that the lamb is symbolize for her innocence but it's for her desire to die peacefully. Something has forced her to keep fighting on the battlefield and arena. She has to keep fighting to protect something, in the video i saw a fetus scene so i think that she is pregnant and that what she wants to protect, even though it make her has to face with the "wolf" Kindred.
adcs: why can the old lady move so much? ambessa in her own video: i got 12 packs in the fridge and i ain't talking 'bout the one in the kitchen
Wait this was a pregnant chick at the start?! I thought it was a guy…
I dont play LOL, who is she? champion name
Both songs and music videos are better than Linkin Park
Another amazing performance from Miss Sheryl Lee Ralph 🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️
Blood, Sweat & Tears*
This showing her getting beat down at every turn and getting back up with that same look in her eyes actually makes me like Ambessa a lot as a character. The sick Disney villain song helps, too, though. lol
dont like the song, cool animation though
Braba, lutar grávida, levar flechada e não morrer.
Это что новый скин на пантеона !?
Looks cool ig
OP champ idgaf idgaf
+1 gym music
This is how our Riot used to work. just give us masterpieces nobody expected. and refuse to elaborate.   This has inspired me to come back to league again because "the weight of the world, wont bend my knees"
WOW
The place looks familiar is this the battle zone south part of demacia?
kindred?
absolute cinema 🤌🤌
WoW... that was actually amazing!
This all thing leaves me with one question who is her daughter's father
maybe the coolest music video the team's put out
New abomination come in league of legend
HOLY MOLY this is so different from the rest of the league's songs that it gave me goosebumps. What an incredible voice
This champion ticks all political correct box Wamen tick Black tick Not straight likely tick Hands is disabled tick Psychopath tick  Yes this company produce garbage character design.
mid
bicho que animação é essa
이거를 롤드컴 노래로 하자
라이엇 티원 진짜 싫어하네
Riot games?.....you mean " Riot Music "
Reminder, if you're impaled, don't pull the object out!
Riot just casually dropping another banger that plays with our hearts.
So what is this?
We making it out of noxus w this one 🔥🔥🔥
this song should be the world champion theme song more than...
Mid, which is on par with Arcane music in general. The normies are gonna like it nonetheless
Interesting mix of imagery; The lyrics and such imply that she had a vision of Pantheon while the presence of both lamb and wolf suggests that kindred was involved on some level.
Definitely did not expect this waking up this morning 😓
Terrible clip, someday the Rito will do good things.
Fino
This song should be 2024 worlds anthem rather than that :U
another agile champion meanwhile blitzcrank slows down few seconds after pressing W
Caralho q topoo
Very mid for a league hype song
god the music sounds great and pantheon looks like an unbreakable wall
MORE KINDRED MAKES ME A HAPPY BOY
why you can't make Worlds MV like this???
Kindred? Instant like.
이런거에 손 많이쓰지 말고 월즈뮤비나 더 잘 만들어주지 …. 이 개이엇아 ….
ok Riot, you got me
First League Cinematic that didn't give me chills, it's good but definitely not something I'll return to watch. Thankfully I got "The Call" cinematic on dial so I'll watch it now.
3:34 can we have this part as a ringtone.
Dad! Riot Games just dropped another banger. You also need to cover the lore for this one.
Ambessa Medarda is coming?
Little too tribal and deliverance for my liking. Felt like i was watching a BLM and DEI video. Meh.
BTS ?
Getting Dishonored vibes , it's very reminiscent of how the Void looks like and how primal it is. Not to mention the appearance of the sea
вот это поворот...   Амбесса ...   нет слов...   девочка закалялась в огне...
Kindred 😍 solo el lobo le puede dar descanso a un guerrero, porque ofrecerá un cordero al lobo? Esta entregando una parte de ella?
또 흑인 레게 여자 물린다 물려 아케인 신챔나오니까 그냥 넘어가는데 또 렐/레나타/암베사  이런 못생긴 흑인 레게 여자 그만 내다오 콩코드 꼴 보고도 암베사를 내냐 차라리 실코를 내던가 암베사 낼거면 세비카를 내주던가
As a Pantheon main, I am delighted to be cooking bread with this one  🗿 🔥🔥🔥
I am simple man I saw league MV I click😅
Okay Necrit, time to do your thing! We're waiting
This is so much better than the 2024 Worlds MV
song and video already 20x better than the champ it's for
Jueguito 1/10 música 2038/10
1:08 it gives me Salvatore dali kind of  vibe, those sequence are so majestic, Fortiche you killing it
Caralhooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo era mesmo a kindred e o lobo só que de forma diferente por causa da regiããão!!!!!!!!!!!!
fraco
sigma auu
Ambessa will NEVER rule over NOXUS! EVERY NOXIAN WILL DENY HER TYRANNY!! 😡😡😡
They named it from Witcher 3 difficulty
롤드컵 faker 뮤비는 그따위로 만들어 놓고 라이엇 니들이 망해야 된다. 돈에 미친 자낳괴
Caramba, botou foi pra lascar essa cinemática
Нудно,😢
이번 월즈를 이렇게 만들지ㅋㅋ
Ficou muito bom. Mas o Blood sweat & tears do BTS é melhor ! 🤭 Ansiosa pela segunda temporada 😍😍😍
Can you add aram ranked system please
who is she?
00:28 kindred's wolf she is fighting death
I THINK THOSE ARE XERATH'S FOLLOWERS FROM LoR
That woman is the kind of man i want to be. FIREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
In Noxus the strong are right  in Noxus the strong lead in Noxus the strong march on blood sweat and tears
THE CLIENT RIOT
3:01 hahahahaahahahahah lil nas x or smt
I wonder if they're showing kindred so much cause they're gonna kill an unexpected character in arcane and show kindred taking his/her life
I LOVE ME SOME LOREEEEE
3:38 is this mel?
When thing gets tough and confusing we call the name of Necrit.
I just went to the video, since the title of the song is the same as one of BTS, but the song is great in every aspect
3:11 she is so badass I thought of her as the Ruined Queen right here
a lamb means sacrifice.
Nice animation
11/10 masterpiece.
Better than Worlds Anthem 2024?   Like if you agree.
OMG IM IN LOVE, AND THE SONG?????? RIOT ALWAYS MAKING AMAZING MUSIC
Sheryl Lee Ralph ateeee
realmente perfeito
is that teressa ?
t1 헌정 뮤비 새로 만든줄 알고 들어왔으면 개추
AAAAAAA hermoso
Perfect example that riot is feeding into the lgbtq movement…sad just sad. Noxus is known for the rule that power is everything and therefore putting a female char in a fighting posision is komplette garbage cause its not logical. But since its a made up world its ok i think.  I think riot should stop feeding into this movement but i can understand if they insinst on doing so .They would be facing harsch consequenses created by this movement.And because all humans love money ,they wont stop feeding into this,but its not not without consequenses for all normal players. I hope for riot that they will one day wake up and understand that, that is not the way.
So i'm guessing this is ambessa origin? Also she in battle while carrying mel?
Necrit we believe in you
This is better than the Linkin park song xD
broken champ and broken song
The wolf....spared Ambessa??
THIS IS HOW YOU DO A FEMALE LEAD no lgbtq nor nonsense  just their purpose and actual personality of THEM as themselves    this is so good
Que se fumaron?
better than heavy is the crown
srednie
woke af
KATARINAAAAAA
23월즈 헌정곡 뮤비나 다시 내라..
me guta
not a bts song lol
Remove malz, viegar, blitz, shaco, teemo, and lux from the game thnx
Remove malz, viegar, blitz, shaco, teemo, and lux from the game thnx
Can't wait for the 2 hour premiere of Necrit's video
nada mas empoderador que ver una negra oprimida revelarse
when KDA COMEBACK
chịu hết nổi mà, hóng Ambessa trong arcane quá đi
🫶
This is so tuff
it makes more sense  why ambessa act the way she does in her dream she has visions of running in a dessert around her figures of soldiers are fighting and women screaming in horro while she only able to run with a lamb in her hands, this may be a experience from her childhood since later in the video we can see a child with a lamb in her hands, is not hard to think that ambessa as a child wasnin middle of a warzone being only able to run as chaos surrounded her and the drums of war haunted her, she must  have hated the feeling of only being able to run like prey, causing later in life to become a wolf so she could fight for her life becoming a victim of PTSD and being haunted by war and conflict, is very interesting.
Rammus is heavily neglected as always
man they always do it right so good
DEI
I have no idea what's going on there but it Look cool, very cool😁
OK RIOT MORE PLEASE
"No offense intended, but my first thought when watching this clip was, here’s another strong Black woman."😢😢
Czekam na 2h omówienia od Marveca
어떻게 한국어로 제목이 피땀눈물
This managed to be better than the Worlds animation 😮
This is literally already better than season 2  I can't wait. Just keep lgbtq out
dòng lệ máu mồ hôi
Wakanda forever.
Wolf spared Ambesas life bcs Mell wasn't suppose to die?
Crazy over it
3:38 and 4:00 i might be crazy but WAS SHE PREGNANT?
The ending cliffs are France, Etretat… probably cause Fortiche is french ! Love it !
Noxis?
Another one another banger
Calm down riot
better than Heavy is the Crown
Miłego Weekendu Marvecc XD
pero que veo? un tema infinitamente mejor que el tema de los Worlds
The visuals on this thing are insane , how do you even go about doing this
Question: we see pantheon training her and kindred gives her whatever that crystal thing is but who is the third one at the back? Based on the hand I think it’s swain?
Now this is what a strong female character should be like. Actually badass and had to take 100 Ls before her W streak.
Now we wait for the Necrit video
Bts xd
Bruh riot, it's no that hard to had a comma. Wtf is blood sweat?
Is this Ambessas background Story?
doesnt speak for me that i realized only after half of that video that this was basicly the lore for the new champion
Cool video, and i like how you guys showed Ambessa struggle, falling and getting back up to get where she is now. Noxus letting a pregnant woman fight in a war is stupid tho.
how make dislike visible?
피땀눈물~
Friendly reminder that this year's Worlds song could have been as HARD as this. COULD. HAVE!
streamer reset stream vib 💀
This should have been the song and theme of Worlds.
Please don't make this lore. This was horrible. No wonder there was so many layoffs holy.
The fact that they animate an entire masterpiece just as a music video within a larger masterpiece is remarkable
Oh boi, can't wait for the 1000 hour long Necrit video I'm so excited
Who else 🤡 because they thought it was a BTS collaboration? Anyway loved it anyway
Chosen of the Wolf !!!
okay the champion is an absolute design disaster but this video is GLORIOUS
@Necrit All yours brother!
NOXUS WILL RISE!
Worst league cinematic so far. Music sounds like genuine AI. Kindred absolutely saved this cinematic.
bruh this sounds better than the worlds song ffs
If even the 4-minute cinematic that Riot made is better than most movies, I can't even imagine how good arcane season 2 is going to be
FOR A MOMENT I THOUGHT OF BTS
yo necrit
What a banger song! Riot the music producer back at it again.
BTS?
Not on spotify?
Who is she? New champ?
riot, do you plan on letting fortiche studio's animators sleep at some point?
I dont understand.... We need Necrit)
Now only if the game would receive this treatment
much better than world anthem video
아 롤드컵뮤비 다시만든줄 알았네
Plot twist: this entire music video is Mel's teaser trailer
can't believe the ambessa lore mv is better than the worlds one
0:05  Fire the video editor, he even misspelled his company name.
🥱
Man i wish that was the world song..... . . . . . . > . > > .     Heavy the clown🤡
4 min vid from Riot = hour+ vid from Necrit
I love the echo sound of "Still here" ver.
Это как сны при температуре 39.5. Офигенно.
I love that no matter the race or the appearance of the character, Riot always knows how to deliver a strong and appealing individual. Is just a strong and unique character that happens to be black, not the other way around. DISNEY... TAKE NOTES.
Young Ambessa?
Wait so... does young Ambessa have a Shurima connection? And was that an incarnation of Pantheon?
I can't get over how amazing these videos are in story and visualy and sound. Freaking AWESOME!  But I also can't get the actual significance of the "lamb sacrifice" or "lamb release" in the desert scene?  Because Ambessa is pregnant in the beach when wolf shows up. And the Kindred's Wolf growls at the Ambessa's belly, stops growling and then looks at Ambessa's face. So now what does this mean? Is the baby gone in place of Ambessa? Or did Ambessa had to "release Kindred's Lamb" somehow in the desert as a trade for both of her life and the baby's at the beach? Because Ambessa had a son at some point. Was she carrying her son on this situation? Or was it a different baby that she maybe lost here and she had her son after these events?  And I can't place the desert scene, but I'm going to make a simple guess that it was a different dream in the "death or afterlife realm" from Kindred.  I don't get why (seems to me at least) Swain and Katarina are in the same "death or afterlife realm" where we also see Kindred and Pantheon as the dead Aspect of War and not Atreus (he doesn't have the scar across the torso). But I guess that seeing Ambessa fighting the Aspect of War was a sort of test to see if she could be the one chosen to either "release Kindred" and save both Ambessa and the baby in the beach, or be the choice for Kindred's wolf in the beach between saving Ambessa and the baby? Which would probably lead to either both were saved by Kindred, or only letting Ambessa die which would mean both die, or only letting the baby die and saving Ambessa?  But I guess they both survive 3:38? Which is weird because "A wolf has no mercy"... I'm quite sure that I'm overthinking this, so I'm done and look forward for the video from Necrit.
Better than 2024 worlds mv
so the fetus was definitely mel, her innocent soul she forged into a sword, and then kindred
Ambessa fighting in a battlefield while being pregnant is so Noxus, but she figthing against The Kindred for the life of her baby is even more. Loved the video.
Fraquinha essa.
OMGOMG OMGOMGOGMOGMOGMOM LOL CONTENT IM SHAKING
LA LETRA ES BUENÍSIMA
ขนลุกคักปู่เอ๊ยย
AMBESSA!!!!!
Manifesting the edits
티원 뮤비 다시 내놔 이넘들아,,,
riot ta trabalhadora
The real worlds anthem
GONNA SPREAD THIS BRILLIANCE ON EVERY SITE I CAN!
뮤비 보고 감탄한 거 처음임ㄹㅇ 얼마나 많은 인력이 갈아넣어졌을까..
Gougou Gaga Ksante gougou
Vocês também acham que a Ambessa tem uma aparência muito masculina?
The wolf and the lamb spared her!!!
anyone noticed that she is pregnant ??? or it is just I have hallucinations
Mel telling her mom not to die as a fetus has to be one of the most iconic moments of League of Legends herstory
Lacração da porra isso é homem ou mulher?
Dang so much emotion portrayed in this. Now that’s how you make a music video!🎉
Thick of it
It's like JIBARO dance in Love, Death and Robot
My only criticism was isn’t she a little old looking to be that mobile, but I guess since she got her powers from another source and it just gave her white hair it’s cool!
Cant wait for Arcane! S2! Why this isnt on spotify yet? I need This to go to work!!!!
Loves that kindred produce the toughest warrior despite her role is literally death itself😅😅😅
Masterpiece 👀❤
_"strength is the only teacher"_
wish the game was good as this
I love how the singer sounds like Ambasa s voice actor
This fits ambessa and illaoi tbh
So we all got spoiled from riot
If you have an arrow embedded in your body, you should not pull it out yourself. Doing so can cause further injury and increase the risk of bleeding. Instead, you should seek immediate medical treatment. If it’s safe to do so, try to stabilize the arrow in place and avoid moving it until you receive professional care.
That drummer monster was WILD
Absolutely amazing!
the song is good but wtf is this video 💀
Can't wait for Necrit's breakdown on this
The industry is dei'id so much that now when I see a strong and independent woman I feel nothing but boredom. Even when the quality is as high as here. Give me at least something for me
YO THIS IS GENUINELY SO FIRE! Definitely top tier music vids they released
피 땀 눈물~
Man I just love the artstyle ❤❤❤
absolute dogshit
Riot, what happened this year? You got everything right with the songs
Let go
Is that girl Ambessa?
caralho riot  botou pra fuderrrr  chorei muitoooo porrraaaaaaaa
Mmo when
She saved her baby even hitten by arrow
So she sacrificed her unborn child to the wolf? is what im getting here Maybe the child was dying since the lamb she carried was falling apart, so she made a deal with death.
Lame
Возня негров под так себе музычку. Спасибо
Ez egy rohadt jó és minőségien kivitelezett klip lett. Gratulálok a csapatnak akik ezen dolgoztak!❤❤❤
Another banger for my song list that I'll listen to long after league has shut down. Chef's kiss.
Class, just class
Wow i would like to know more about what or who these characters are and the music is fire !
WHAT is this masterpiece????
Tears... of hardstuck players.
Imagine if she wore that armour in-game
The quality of this video is better than Linkin Park. Where is the Riot's respect to the winner of Worlds 2023?
Gonna throw a random guess here and say the golden shield guy is probably the chad guard that was with her during Season 1, but he kinda too badass here to just be a guard.
wow cool
I love this but it still doesn't make any sense to give a beefy armored bruiser infinite dashes. You telling me a big, muscular and armored person is more agile than a ninja/assassin?
this is a success. Now you did something really good riot
Arcane team has been COOKIN
Riot dropping what was supposed to be the Worlds song during the semifinal is crazy
DEI Champion
The Lamb signifies her former compassion, (like Mel), which then get replaced by the way of the wolf (no mercy).
Meh. Looks more like an Amoebaessa.
ANG POGI GAG0
why she has visions of targon and I guess its solari (gold armor, red cloth, Rising Sun "plumage" on the helmets)? Noxus had was with targon? And I guess this pantheon looking guy is previous Pantheon, before Atreus, or when Atreus body was taken control by Pantheon? Pantheon as a celestial being is Solari in origin?? yes his helmet has fire and some effects has fire, but as he has blue clothes in LoL as Atreus I thought he is not solari, thats pretty cool if it is. And maybe when pantheon took hold of Atreus body he beaten up noxians? pretty cool, wanna hear voice-lines of ambessa vs panth more. Also this could be in her head, she sees panth as a Solari-great warrior and a teacher that put her on the way of never giving up. who knows? but its pretty cool. more lore more lore.
Meh
W
I love that it sounds like Ambessa is singing! With Heartsteel, my biggest criticism was that the voice didn't match the champions, especially K'sante and Kayn
🤡🤡🤡Tryndamere 🤡🤡🤡🤡
I need to know this lore
wow amazing work, this one was pure fire, i liked it so much
Incredible animation and music video.
Maravilha!
bangalore in league is wild
Муть
Cringe video
Alright time to wait for Necritt to break down the lore for me.  Also very good music video
Ambessa got 1 on 1 training with Pantheon no wonder she is broken.
What is this? 🥹😮‍💨😪
omg thats too way better than my music
heavy is the cringe
It's just 4 mins video but for Necrit, it's a whole 1 hour lore.
DEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM
Ambessa should've kept the arrow in, if you ever was stabbed always leave the object in until you have it surgically removed, otherwise you'd bleed out
Who is she ? Ambesa medarda?
a mulé é pika grossa mesmo
So this is where all the worlds song budget went to
3:10  Yo: ahhhhhhhhhhhh
NOXUS? SOLARI? TARGON? KINDRED? Y'ALL ARE KINDDING ME?
Me pergunto, poderia se kanon, tipo ela passou por essa batalha?
Boring.
Is the Noxian version of Kindred just 2 wolves or just Wolf without Lamb?
The opening made me groan aloud, but at least they didn't make the pregnant woman fight with an arrow in her ... Isn't that where the liver is located?
wow❤❤
Y no one talk about she’s pregnant 😭
Much better than the world music
LOOOOVING the noxian representation of kindred
+15 points has been added to your ESG score.
The fact that Ambessa only sees wolf and a more Wolflike lamb variations because noxus only belives in in wolf is such nice attention yo detail
Noxus>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>piltover,demacia,zaun,league of legends
EITA PORRA !
que carajos acavo de ver
why does it look more Solari than Noxian im so confused
I can't believe Ambessa will really hit prod. This is absurd...
Very appropriate for Swain to be in this skinline, he also had a battlefield awakening/was close to death.
Not me assuming BTS singing for LoL😂
xd?
I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this I want my art to look like this
Now we won't see Kindred or Pantheon in a good cinematic because they used them in this, unlucky.
Im predicting at max 500k views this is kinda disappointing
wait.. is she pregnant at the beginning?
so cool
I didn't understand, what happened to the baby?
I kept hearing Sauron name been song. i think i've watched to much LOTR.
Esta es Ambressa Medarda de joven? En un inicio pense que si, pero tiene pinta de ser un nuevo personaje
loving a new muscle mommy joining the rift!
😍😍😍😍
So if Ambessa is pregnant does that mean the baby is Mel, or has she had other children ?
Pantheon, Swain, Ambessa and Katarina are the characters I can see in this video.
There is SO MUCH to decript here
Brothers is medarda fron arcane
This was the best song yet!! Well together with Legends never dies, Rise, Take over....🙈🤣
This is actually crazy.. I'm mostly playing hoyo gacha games this year and coming back to this the trailers Riot makes is really on another level 😅 the goosebumps i got, and even the music and expression of the character.. the world Riot created as well.. I feel like man, these gacha games might be earning a lot but this production value deserves as much.
Cool animation 😶
*This title triggered my Limbus Company Outism.*
Kindred buff and rework when
Cu
Muito perfeito veyr
Even for Fortiche standards, this is just jaw-dropping!
Very appropriate for Swain to be in this skinline, he also had a battlefield awakening/was close to death.
INSANE LIKE USUAL !
music is terrible as usual, but thanks for video! it was nice with no sound!
Such a visual trip i love it ❤
Arcane s2 is actually a musical like joker 2 lol
This champion will be for the blood of noobs and only the sweats, sweats, and only sweats shall  based champ we need this one frfr
Wait... is that the Noxian version of Kindred???
@Necrit pls explain why it was swain katarina and pantheon there (or at least that's what I thought who they were)
Is that ambessa singing?  We're cooked.
League of Legends making another absolute banger to listen to, coupled with a bunch of lore to watch.
So this is Kindred background story, kind of ? o_0... I were wondering which champ that is...
Oh she mothered
fein fein fein
One of the best things Riot has ever put out.
WAIT WAIT WAAAAAAAAAIT! DID THE WOLF JUST SHOW MERCY????
Warriors le gana
Ready for the 2 hours animation breakdown from TBSkyen :D
Kinda like this more then heavy is the crown....
this is amazing
This is amazing, always putting so much effort not only in music and lyrics quality, but also in music video.  I am left speechless everytime.
What I'm wondering if this Ambessa is from the original timeline or the Arcane universe.
I'm a listen to this like 100 times, why is this not at 13 million views yet.
nailed it
Drop it on Spotify, pleaaase
That was quite the audio/visual trip, when you pair such a powerful energetic voice like Sheryl's with such beautiful trippy visuals (from Fortiche I assume) you get something so mesmerizing and breathtaking! 😍  Can't wait for season 2 ;)
brabo
when i saw blood sweat and tears, i think it was a linkin park song lol
Love this song, and the video is gorgeous! So excited to see more Ambessa!!!
muito foda!
we have already blood sweat and tears from BTS
this is not BTS song....🤔
Кажется я знаю что у меня пойдет в плейлист.
Waiiit.. so is it just me, or does this look almost exactly like that one Episode from Love Death and Robots?🤔😂  No shade tho, this is awesome💯
Wow. We got cutscene creep now? She gets a whole cinematic?
Can we have a series for this after Arcane😢😢😢
I really thought it was a BTS song edit 😂
More lore than Shaco
I guess the lamb symbolizes her innocence, which gets slowly chipped away by war after war and battle after battle. Until it reshapes into the heart of a wolf, creating the battle hardened warrior and conqueror we know today as Ambessa.
❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
별로다
eww
I dont know what's going on. Is she the girl from tales of runeterra Noxus, is that Xerath's minions (the blue humanoids), is that a solarian warriors? 😂
NEAR DEATH GANG
왜 가수 안나옴?? 노래 부르는 가수 나와야지
롤드컵 뮤비는 망쳐놓고...왜 아케인에 나오는 신챔 하나한테는 직접 노래까지 뽑으면서 만드는건데...
🤮
Kindred showing up makes the video instantly epic.
아ㅋㅋㅋ 씨 월즈 뮤비 다시 나온줄ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Tip: do not remove an arrow like she did, you'll die of bleeding
100%ban rate
Is that a deal with Kindred
씨발 이건 존나 잘만들어 놓고
So, the Kindred spare her life and make her some kind of wolf herald or familiar?
I think the lamb that she she hold represent the way of the lamb where one except their death, but once she let go of the lamb, she embraces the wolf
Noxus Prevalecerá.
Is this a young Ambessa?
Sensacional
muscle mommy
How many times did you rewatch this?   Me:Yes
Rito really going for the DEI
월즈 뮤비나 다시 내라
I see people talking about kindred but can we talk about how BADASS PANTHEON SWAIN AND KATARINA LOOK!! LIKE THIS SKINLINE IS COOL
Does this mean that Swain will potentially show up in Season 2 of Arcane?
awful song awful this is not league
A referência surrealista... lindo!
My favorite music company posted another masterpiece !
Не могла не вспомнить BTS, прочитав название клипа. Арми поймут😂
kino who Is Kino Ambessa's dead son?
swain, phanteon, ambessa, katarina
DUUUUUUUUUDE!!! This already explains so much!!!
League of legends Lore will be an entertainment masterpiece.
Wow! Fortiche has done it again
is that young ambessa ?
롤 뮤비 제목이 어떻게 방탄노래 GOAT ㅋㅋㅋ
This is riots way of saying: this champion us not 200 years. It is 400
3:09 새로운 왕이 탄생하리라
so we get swain, katarina, pantheon, ambessa and kindred if i saw that correct
I'd scream like that too if i lost my baby goat. :(
Are they drawing parallels with the lamb/wolf and Ambessa/Mel? That could be really interesting.
Eu n entendi foi nada nessa budega!
Welcome Ambessa , don't get nerfed yet.
We got Kindred in the Arcane universe before GTA VI lesgooo
420 bruh
I really like the visuals, but the song is not catchy anyhow
can't wait for necrit to make a 50 min video about this song
kindred?
The music video is so sick man,
Never get tired of this art style
getting tired of all this diversity bs that riot is injecting in the games for a couple years now.
nice.
to arrepiado  que música foda
She was pregnant and the Sheep asked the Wolf to spare her?
Jesus... CHRIST... there is so much to unpack on this, The Lamb and Wolf allegory is the easy one.  Rito is not beating the allegations of being a music company that just happens to make games.
BTS reference? O.o
Kinda confused need necrit to explain the interplay between kindred and pantheon? But loved this video XD
Chosen of the Wolf for Katarina, Swain, Pantheon and Ambessa (not including Kindred here because) those are all champions who had very close encounters with death in their lore right?
govno ebanoe
lol, and none of the lore people are going crazy over from this video will matter cause the actual story and lore is a complete mess xD Fortiche studios once again carrying Riot with their animation.
이 정성을 월즈 뮤비에....
Pantheon: get pwnd
one of the worst cinematics ever
yeah kindred
DAME
Is this the story of God himself, Kratos? I see similarities
the moment she's surrounded by the masked cult-like figures doen't get old it's those moments are so surreal
É indiscutível que lol tem uma  das melhores cinemáticas e músicas bem construídas, caralho ficou top.
Blood sweat and layoffs
Some people say that it is not Pantheon but a different dude, But I still think he is. Given the fact that ambessa becomes one of them makes me think that it is pantheon. Pantheon is a spartan in which fights the war so it is not far fetch that he encountered the wolf and received lamb's raspite. At 3:25 , We can see other characters that received Lamb's raspite : - Swain from getting almost killed by Irelia at the battle between Ionia and Noxus - Katarina, I think its because of her encounter with Talon in which he failed to assassinate her? Idk, I haven't read her story but it'll be cool if it is so.  - and others that received the raspite.  Its so cool to know the role of death in league :D
We do hereby summon thee, Necrit.
I EFFING LOVE KINDRED man!!!🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍
Necrit having a field day with this one
This is like the Tryndamere scene in the "Still Here" music video expanded. I haven't played in a while, is this teasing more Kindred lore?
망할 24월즈 뮤비나 다시 만들라고
amazingggggggg
1:39 is so cool!!!😢
nice sweet baby inc moment
FODA
I NEED A MUSIC VIDEO ABOUT JHIN!!!!

Thought it was the BTS Song
Nice video , garbage song , down falling from last years

press x to pay respect to the 'Heavy is the Crown' Music video
I miss old quality cinematics..
people will come back here in 10 years ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              and at that time people will be dying to enter "Eternalis"...
<3
WOW
Jokes about necrit is not funny and necrit himself is a talentless hack lol
Ambessa >>>>>> Faker
SWAIN SPOTTED! NOXUS #1 NX NX NX NX NX!
oho
I don't care if she is 200 years. Ambessa is the coolest character in game, and I can't hate her anymore after this.
Amazing but a music video with Caitlyn and Vi would be better
Noxus next Arcane season🔥🔥🔥
que coisa linda
돈낭비 심하네. 이런거 만들시간 있으면, T1 헌정곡이나 다시 만들어라.
Cool animation. Mid song
Ñ
First Riot, now Leage!? *oh yeah, November is gonna be good❤
I'll blame KINDRED for not ending this one. Now she's gonna destroy the game.
Absolute Cinema
Wait... it looks so much like Étretat at 3:58 - those are really beautiful French cliffs. I don´t know if that´s on purpose but I love it 😍
dm hhay vai ca lon
report kat no white hair
I mean, ok...
Historia de ambessa en 4 minutos...  Las fumadas de RITO son cine cuando se lo propone 🥃
simplemente perfecto
this is something!
Awesome
3:35 My girl Mel lives
The more I look at them(especially on Ambess), the more they remind me of "Consort Radahn" from Elden Ring.
Not gonna lie I thought this was Arcane. Unless it is-
Amebessa Medarda is good character but a terrible champion!
Whoever give me likes I will listen 👂 again ❤❤
Chosen of the Wolf. I think I get it, all of these champions survived Death/Kindred in some way: - Ambessa was on the brink until she felt her child and it gave her strength to get back up. - Atreus was “killed” as the Aspect and managed to live on without Pantheon. - Katarina faces death on a daily basis and almost died giving her life to Noxus (Bit of stretch but that’s my two cents) - Swain is harder to pin down but maybe it has to do with the fact Swain was sent to die in Ionia but was reborn as the Grand General of Noxus when he made a deal with Raum?
Kindred built different. ❤️
song better then song heavy is the crown
A mulher rei
SWAIN :D
No entendí una mierd 😂😂😂
Me when I just hear the start of her singing🥵
Best one yet!! Peak
Riot is an animation company that just so happens to make video games on the side.
Как же жаль ,что не инвалидкой стала, так бы был полный повесточный набор: темнокожая, беременная, сильная и независимая  инвалидка)
2:26 do u see swain and katarina
かっこよすぎ
3:03 Beautiful, 🙌CINEMA🙌
Love the power I feel
BTS?
Lame especially the music.
IONIA COASTLINE???!!?!! IONIA INVADED ALREADY??!?!!
May be I get it wrong but I thought this is the concept of being hallucinate when you are between the line of life and death.
Not bad
This is way too deep for my brain. I need Necrit video NOW
IM GAGGGGGGEDDDDD
THATS MY GOAT
Ambessa is what happens when the Wolf slaughters the Lamb.
Idk whats going on but im here for it holy
The last time I saw this chick was she was asking for "cuisine" in Piltover
barbara howard what are u doing here
does anyone know if the singer here is the voice actress of ambessa too?
Where there are wolves, the kindred are close by.
estou feliz em ver essa animação obrigado.
Fire
ААА НЕГРЫ
wow - this is such a banger on all ends! I really love this!
great music. didn't like the visuals though. style is great but the topic is meh. don't enjoy looking at suffering pregnant women too.
parabens, ficou lindo!!!!
Riot's music team is on a different level, and this skinline looks absolutely amazing! 🔥
AMBESSA SINGING?! OMG!
young-basa?
WAS THAT KINDRED BEFORE THEY SPLIT THEMSELVES
ambessa
Amazing
How much are you going to show Kindred in cinematics? Riot: yes......
cringe af
i love SWAIN <3
VIVE FORTICHE ET VIVE LA FRANCE
delete this
Is it just me, or did you all not understand it either?
Pantheon is too OP for you 😅😅😅
te amo arcane.
BTS SONG MENTIONED
Good writing, bad game design, classic riot games
HOLY SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHH
In 2:27 thats Katarina on the background?!
look our game trash but we are woke
incroyable !
Absolute Cinema
nic nie skumalem pozdro
1 hour gang, yall
So she made a deal with that wolf to survive with Mel in her womb? Would at least explain why Mel survived that terrorist attack at the end of s1 of Arcane.
who tf thought that sending a pregnant woman to a battle was a good idea.
Black wakanda girlboss riot will never make original content again
Stopped playing league like 1 year ago after playing since season 3, but how easily want me to come back to this videos? Kindred in it. Boom, i'm on my knees
First.
Sheryl Lee Ralph the woman you are 🔥🐺
Another masterpiece from the bests.
Meet riot People think Riot is a game developing company But games are just the face, real stuff are everything except Game And thats what we like aboit Riot Great music and video with lore again
Its the entire state of ranked matchmaking fight now: blood, sweat and tears... But it used to be FUN.
BTS?
I think people think she fought in this purgatory for her life vut I think it was her son life she fought for with him as a baby  The arrow hit her mid section
Omg, Kindred?! 🔥😭
let me guess, pantheon is going to be legendary? since in the video he can open and close his shield?
Isso que é uma intro de campeão foda.
3:18 AIN'T THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD CHILLS OVER THAT PITCH... 🤯
gosh!!!! I got goosebumps while watching this!!! RIOT you really don't disappoint..
Amazing! ...  ... ps: the pulling of the arrow bothers me a bit
Even if I don't play league anymore I will always come back here for the amazing musics and animation ❤
Gigachad fighting while pregnant noxian mommy mindset
Que clipe incrível, adore.
the baby fetus saved her....
some parts of Lyrics cringe... visual amazing, how always!
My goodness this is FIRE 🔥🔥🔥 ARCANE SEASON 2 IS GONNA BE AMAZING 🤩🤩🤩
@necrit now we're waiting for your content hhahahahaha
Absolute cinema as always by riot
đây đáng lẽ nên là bài nhạc mở màn cho chung kết thế giới năm nay :)))
How many times did you rewatch this?   Me:Yes
americans worshipping black people YAWN
なんか凄いって事は伝わってきた❕
arcane ! ! !
From the blood to the sweat to the tears to the king
WOULD
그러니까 저기있는 멤버들이 다 t1이라는 거죠?
This is why women sholdn't take part in war when they are pregnant.
masterpiece
There is a small detail there that she is fighting while PREGNANT. Now that's girlboss!
She needs to be alive for her baby and Kindred gives her a chance. Goosebumps!
It's probably the shittest music video release out of all of them so far. Animation is nice. But we all know we want to see our favourite  champions in these cinematic.
So did Ambessa make a deal with Wolf/Lamb to sacrifice her children so that she can grow more powerful?
Such a cool music and clip for such a disgusting champion
@Necrit put me in the video :gun-1:
판테온 진짜 씹간지네..
I understand nothing, where is the Necrit video ?
I'm guessing Noxus has specialists individuals like that one Solarian with the spear and shield and each region integrating it into their own
Cringe
티원 뮤비보다 잘뽑았네 ㄷㄷ
Did they just drop this in the middle of a Worlds match lol
Absolute cinema
This one is on fire🔥🔥🔥 So much better quality than the heavy is the crown.. like seriously riot you know you could've done better🤡
Plz, make a game with those characters already !!!!!
letssss goooo
I love the fact that the voice of the singer sounds really like Ambessa's VO, it's like she's singing her song .
Kindred slowly becoming the main character of LoLiverse and I am ALL FOR IT! Also, the animation is just freaking dope - oozes of creativity, kudos to the team behind it!
Entendi nada mas tá perfeito Riot games 🇧🇷❤️
You can literally hear how doubtlessly Woodkid produced this. Amazing.
Peak Cinema
Caramba que foda demais, ela lutou contra o lobo dos kindres e sobreviveu mais um dia, e logo depois tudo em nome da filha ❤
OMG how many layoff did it take to make this?
animation is SO GOOD OMG😫
NO FEARS OF SALMON🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Maybe its me or are they Trying to wake Iron Solari skinline? (forgot that RiotParrot guy).
IM IN LOVE WITH YOUNG ABMESSA................... I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU
WAS THAT ARCANE STYLE LAMB?
2:32 Swain, Katarina, and Pantheon 👀
Can someone explain the desert part?
Shame this video is tied to a already hated character because of "200 years of league"
Kindred's ult is a very neat way to explain how Mel Medarda and Jace survived Jinx's rocket at the end of Arcane S1.
Now it's character  deployment
Tendi foi nada akakakakka mas amei
giga gówno, nara
Ambessa was in my top fav of Arcane. This song and video is incredible.
3:42 aaaaaand she's dead, lol, don't pull foreign objects out kids. They could be keeping all the blood in.
Most trash music clip I ever seen from Riot
Es impresionante la cinematica de Ambessa, que emocion la segunda temporada de Arcane y tambien el champ jugable !
Brabo
Death only forgive the most stronger and ruthless warrior! 👊🩸💪🐺👑
Ding ding chicken dinner riot helped with mastersploder winner
My goodness make a series about Noxus ASAP!
love it
Riot is straight up immune to doing poor animations
Necrit is going to have a lot of fun with this one for sure!
Trans?
Op
이렇게 할 수 있었잖아 왜그랬어
Oh this is what straykid's come play preview had in description- blood sweat and tears Wonder what the line, remember me and sucker is 😮
i need this on spotify
esta horrible
No understand
Should feel sympathy or what? Riot becoming disney when everyone need tragic backstory
welp put her in 2XKO then
I believe it is implied here that Embessa does not know she is pregnant until she is about to accept the “gift” and then she has a vision of her child and snaps back. At least I think this is what is happening.
Its a most atmosheric and beatiful hybrid of 2D and 3D. I want see isame in next LoL series from fortiche🎉
I wasn't expecting a video, but it was a realy cool surprise, love the song and animation
Such a dogshit omg
PURE MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!!!🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Masterpiece🔥
3:41 is that Wolf leaving because Ambessa is still alive or revived by Lamb? Cause if yes, that's a sick detail for me.
Shut up and take my money riot
Ok i didnt realize fortiche made so much money off arcane that they can make the most realistic animation ive ever seen
I dont get it
Necrit is gonna have fun with this one!
3:26 Oh Katarina, Jericho, and Atreus.
At least it’s not Linking Park 🤣🤣
dayum, that pantheon guy probably must be Rahvun, the Daylight Sun from LoR
SHOW
much better story than Linking Park Opening 🤷‍♂️
is ambessa letting go of the lamb supposed to represent her abandoning mel to become the ruthless leader she needs to be?
So who is Mels father?
Ela foi treinada pela Shyvana até anda igualzinho 😍😍🥰
firat time I didn't instantly like a League song 😔
her arc is gonna be so good, i wanted to see more of who ambessa is and the gave itt!
I only opened this because I thought it was BTS. Disappointed. 💔🤣
I'm so glad league exists, not the game ofc. I mean this part of league
If rise is a 10 then this also is a 10 in my books
Here before Necrit
This Music Company never fails to empress me with their MV's
WoW. I love this character already
RELEASE THE MMO RIGHT NOOOOOOOOOOOW
This really give Hellblade vibes
Nice video but she has 5 dashes so I still want to throw up
AMAZING. 10/10
Dude we need kda!!!!
THE ANIMATION OH. MY. GOD.
the detail that she is pregnant
I'm ready for the 2 hour Necrit video explaining every frame of this video as lore.
Wow, they put more budget into a new champion instead of the theme song of this year WORLDS :)
KLED: THIS IS NOXUS!!!
I love that you had Sheryl Lee Ralph singing this.  She's so underrated and overlooked.  She deserves to be acknowledged by newer generations.
Nah the song wasnt it chief . aint gonna lie
Херня какая-то.
mel medarda used solari confirmed
we are larping as churchill 😎😎😎😎 les goo❗❗❗❗
сюда
Is this the new champion when she was young?!?
we eating bois
Wait she is from Shurima 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Ce trop beau
New champ?
The runeterra lore is so rich
Where is Sheryl Lee Ralph's name in the title?
Early
Bots are going to ask for likes
Marvecc ja już czekam na analizę
Well done Rito.
I swear its ambessa VA singing, i bet after arcane it'll be Noxus.
Ela carregando uma ovelha (kindreds) e lutando pela vida contra o deus da guerra (Phanteon) e ganhado mais uma chance de viver! No final ela acorda parecendo que está em Ionia. Cara se for isso é CINEMA DEMAIS!!!!
Is there Swain and Katarina at the end????
aaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAA temón, la verdad que espectacular animación, por diosss
BEST CINEMATIC SO FAR! ILL FIGHT MY STANCE TILL I SEE KINDRED MYSELF, IDC
A wolf has no mercy
Ambessa  Pantheon  Swain  Katarina Got the blessing of the respite from Kindred in which from Wolf that signifies fighting death Very interesting I know Swain battled his life for the humanity he has against a demon Pantheon battling a god for his life to regain his humanity Ambessa here Katarina I don't know helpp
3:25 😦😨😱😍
Brutal
Blood is whats boiling in my veins when I see my team8s, sweat is whats dripping on my forehead from helding back to not curse some bloodlines and tears is what will drop from my eyes when I see this game closed.
저는 이 음악은 익힘을 중요시보는데, 맛있게 잘익었네요
RAHHHH
Am I tripping or is she pregnant?
Bu adamlar bu işi yapıyor bea
They only put in this much effort for niggera
They’re going all in with her, love it
I loved this so much!
Is the last shot a reference to Eugen Bracht's "The Shore of Oblivion"?
Whats is Ambessa gym program? the gains are real
Raaaaaaaajjjiooooooot
uhm whatever
Lord of god the animation is one of the kind is tooo good I can’t described
Caraio ambessa
leaked to early??
well that was a trip
Marvecc analiza
tragic
me thinking this a canon lore music video
Welp was a good run goodbye league
Now im convincing myself that RIOT made Worlds MV bad on purpose hmmm.
Look like v but black
i have chills
티원 롤드컵 우승 뮤비나 이렇게 만들지 그랬음 퀄리티 차이 너무 비교되네
This looks like those art pieces you go to events for, where everywhere you look there is some detail with the most insane of reasons of why its there. Defitly not something i expected to see animated outside of maybe love, death and robots or by riot of all people. But as always amazing music and im glad we back to the gorgeous visuals
Average emerald games experience:
Feels like "death" is the theme RIOT is going for right now. We better see a cinematic featuring shadow isle characters destroying life all over while Maokai tries to fight it or something.
wait could that kindred be the noxian interpretation of them?
повесточка пошла, свит беби инк детектед
Love this video. Love U guys try to make video that LOL story goes on
Sweating and crying when your blitzcrank supp misses his Q the 40th time in a row
Are these blue guys Xerath's acolytes?
i m on the thick of it
It’s like she’s fighting the last ascendant, pantheon, for her seat as one among them. Where she takes the role as an avatar of kindred??
New champs
With all this marketing I can understand why her in-game character is so overloaded. Awesome clip and soundtrack tho
New kindred wtf
I’m loving Kindred showing up in more and more cinematics! Getting to see the targonian version of them is awesome! Targonian lamb is so creepy!
is the wolf impregnate ambessa???
I thought that a wolf had no mercy...
soo ambessa was train by pantheon omg  huge
i hate her kit so much
Bro who is that woman in the video?She reminds me of someone but I can't get my head around who she is
3:30 ambessa looks like nier automata's opera boss
I really love the voice of the singer, it just feel very match to the animation
No meu Spotify agora
DEMON TIME?
I'm starting to think riot made better music than making games
Don't dare tell me the beachside wasn't Etretat. Je vois ce que vous avez fait là Fortiche... GG to everyone involved with this clip, that was fantastic!
Eyyyyy
Lovely video, great song! But please for the love of god... DON'T PULL OUT OBJECTS FROM DEEP PENETRATIVE WOUNDS LIKE THIS!
CARALHO
ข้าคือ Ambessa ข้าจะฆ่าทุกคนให้สิ้น
D.E.I detected
The artistry in this video is insane.
The animation, the music... everything is SO good ❤🔥
U CAN’T JUST DROP THIS NOW WITHOUT WARNING ME! 😭
I NEED THE OTHER SONGS TOO THAT WERE PLAYED IN THE PAUSE DURING WORLDS
UUUF Pero que obra Maestra es esta, las cinematicas del lol nunca decepcionan, a parte buena cancion : :D
Quick question: Was this song written by the _same_ Rose Betts that wrote Driving Myself Home? If yes, that's a crazy range.
BTS momento?
The song is over,  why do i still have goosebumps over my entire body?!
Necrit we will need you
this is immaculate 🔥🔥🔥
ESTER DEAN?!!?!?
Kindred slowly becoming the main character of LoLiverse and I am ALL FOR IT! Also, the animation is just freaking dope - oozes of creativity, kudos to the team behind it!
Necrit got lot work to do.
❤❤❤
okey womens girls have stronger by liddle bit
Another banger cooked by Riot 🔥🔥
League shld just make a movie alr n more tv series
Hello Necrit
My media literacy needs work.  I'm so confused.  The beginning and end I get.  Was she Shuriman originally?  Who or what are all those freaky masked warriors?  The war drummer on stilts?  The crystal figures?  What's with the mechanical lamb?  Is it all a flashback of a... training montage?  Origin story?  Or is it symbolic like As We Fall?  Or a little of both?  I'm going to have to re-watch this a few times to try and figure this out.
Fortiche once again blessing us with insane animations
She fought in Ionia? now the energy makes sense.
omg and this is art
Oh god this is actually so good
Was that like, pre-fighting-Aatrox Pantheon?? Is Ambessa a freaking Aspect?? ARE WE GETTING ASPECTS IN ARCANE?????!!!! Dude my hype levels just soared like 1000%
Agatha flirting with Rio same energy 🤡
This one is fresh.. everything from music, and characters... some of this scene might have an answer when the season 2 releases
3:25 Pantheon, Swains, Ambessa, Katarina, Kindred
블랙 팬서에서 조금 따온 것 같은 느낌도 있네
i'm going to work for Fortiche.
이런거 잘만들면뭐해 밸런스폭망에 게임이 산으로가서 망하고있는데.
이렇게 잘 만들수있으면서 크라운은 왜..
1:40 holy
Isso não é uma empresa de games e sim o próprio exército 💀
Is she pregnant with her son at this point? Or was that mel?
What a strong voice.. wow
월챔 인력을 죄다 여기로 돌렸나버?
Is that the war mommy from arcane or is it her people?
No cap rewatching the video really made me having a thought that it's like forging her making her a real hard steel, and it's really hype the animators really made it
라이엇이 망하면 수영장 아리와 함께 곡과 엘범만 나온다고 한다 난 이 이야기를 정말 좋아한다
I love how they showed the noxian kindred where its only the wolf
My soul to Fortiche, you're amazing and my absolute favorite studio. GG RIOT GAMES
Made by Fortiche?
The way I screamed when I saw the thumbnail and thought it was a Pentakill song
😂😢
2:35 pantheon, Katarina, and swain 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 2:58 kindred reviving her was soo badass😤😤🔥🔥
Nice cinematic, bad character in game
Alright this is not my Type of Music this time
Katarina , Swain y pantheon?? ❤
This song is fire though
ambéisso...sem carisma e nada envolvente
Muinto foda
soo ww coming and inpregnat abesa?
i like it
W
Finally... a good song after so long Why is lol music downgrade for that long tho
ITS OUT!!
another banger cinematic and song but the champ has overloaded kit
Is that a kindred legendary? 😍
Pregnant on the battlefield? How Noxian, and how irresponsible >:(
I dont understand. She fell in battle, wolf approached meaning shes close to death, then i guess she ascends mt targon over and over until she was gifted some power from kindred allowing her to stand with pantheon and cheat death?
Riot should just stop making games lmao
Those tall things that were drumming were so freaking SICK!!!!!
Making this video 4 minutes and 20 seconds is certainly an interesting choice
So is Ambessa Noxian, by way of Shurima…or Targon?
Noxus gonna be the next region for the next League animation after Arcane 🤞
Necrit: AAAHHHHH HERE WE GO AGAIN!!
BORING. How about a white straight man as a hero RIOT. That one actually makes sense.
The scenes of young Ambessa in the battlefield feels like scenes that could appear in Arcane 2 Does that mean... possible Kindred cameo in Arcane??
2:33 are those 2 in the back swain and katarina?!
They cooked. This should have been the Worlds anthem ngl
bixa vcs arrasaram visse
Apareceu os kindred eu arrepio na hora.
LEET THEM COOK. É DISSO QUE NÓS GOSTA PORRA!!
Sheryl was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 What a voice!
Big strong black woman
What!!!! THIS IS SOOOOO GOOD! Like wow, the intensity, the strength, the BEAUTY, the lore!!!! I love how they decided to show more of kindred based on our reactions for the new season cinematic! That's so nice! I love it SO SO MUCH!!!!
this comment will not have a single like
is this the origin of Ambessa's daughter, Mel, Tatoos came from? 2nd chance revival? blessing from Kindred?
Kindred ♥
Dude just give me Arcane!!! I’m so hypee!!!!!!!!!
Quiero que Ambessa sea mi Mamá.
F u l g b t
YESSS!!
Of course she gets a lore music video, unlike other champion releases XD
Saw the name thought it was that BTS song lol
Is that KSI at 1:20?
This is so trash brooo 😂😂😂
LMAO for a second i thought Riot started working with BTS because of the song title hahaha
This is ritual ????? 😅
Absolute cinema. Ambessa going to war is one thing, but going to war pregnant? That's horrifyingly badass
Im stunned
Legendary Pantheon, Epic Katarina, Swain, Medarda and Kindred
"All roads lead to BTS"
This is how you empower a woman and give her strength and a good background. This is not forced inclusiveness, this is art and the representation of real life, where strong women exist and they are warriors, mothers, architect or whatever they want to be
"sees pantheon"   me: DADDY
What is this chicken 😭😭😭
월즈 주제곡을 이만큼 좀 내주지..
Did she just sold her child live/soul to Kindred. So she can live/gain power?
опять сильная и независимая книга
Kindred in arcane 2????
ready for the week long necrit video
Unnecessary hype for a lame character
Everything is 10/10 but man, lyrics that dont rhyme is just a bit off to me😅 but that's just me ofc. Love the meaning of the lyrics, just the flow and rhyme is not it for me
Animation looks crazy
Oh my god the visuals are STUNNING
new game mode trailer? looks good.
I could be reading into it and I don't even know how this would make sense but does anyone else get Trans flag vibes from the color of the face paint in 3:06 and 3:14???
absolute banger
Yeah.. I'mma need Necrit to explain 😅
The company that makes movies and music is better than the company that makes games -_-
I assume they are not hiring complete clowns to make these videos, so why are the game devs so insanely incompetent?
so...The statue is the reason Ambessa survived? And what's with that infant close-up, is that Mel?
This is Epic.
Oh kindred my beloved
👌
Cinema 🚬
One of the shitier songs you've managed to put out. In sync with the champion, I guess.  Couple more fkups and we'll see who's "still here" in 2025.
This is the result of lay offs btw
Gak pelit animasi
I haven't been vibing much with the songs released for arcane until now but this? NOW THIS!!!! IS EPIC
WHAT A BANGER!!
월즈 뮤비를 이렇게 만들었더라면
riot games should have done this as a League of Legends World Cup music video.
KINDRED MENTIOND
Cadê a legenda Riot
Philippines internet providers are sabotaging Worlds viewership.
I didn't understand anything
THIS IS SO FIRE OMG I LOVE YOU FORTICHE
Absolute cinema 😍😍
Wait did she just fighted with the aspect of war?? MY BOI PANTHEON?
here on release day?! AWESOME~!
"A Wolf has no mercy" literally Wolf leaving her alive
the song is perfect, and the perfection of the animations is already undeniably extraordinary
We get a new champion with a new cool looking skinline. Some golden blood stuff, can't wait for the preview of them.
Where is the Ivern lore though 😢
Fortiche cooked with this one
2:27 Swain and kata behind?
.
Amazing introduction for a new Champion. What a Masterpiece!!!
so ambessa is pregnant and her ult will trhow the baby at the enemy... nice
3:10 bro thinks she's Viego
Waiting for Necrit to explain this to me
Fortiche are so good man
They cooked
Oh my god.
Not Bad, just give her blindfolds and diablo wing and she could be the Illidan of Shurima/Noxus
Pantheon having a side hussle as noxians sparring partner to check if someone is worthy of a second chance is wild.
Can't wait for Arcane season 2, your art direction is so incredible. And music too !!
So does the lamb she carries in her arms represent the life she carries in her belly ?
thats the worst song Riot ever made
VTNC! QUE FODA TUDO! INSANO! sem palavras aqui. Ambessa reina.
Eh. I'm not saying I don't like it, but usually League music videos give me chills or get me super amped, especially the first time I watch them; didn't happen this time.
Woaw Ester Dean
Riot should change their names to Riot Music, and holy god the animation.
She went into battle while pregnant? Kinda insanely irresponsible, but ok.
This is badass
New jg champion?
No idea what i just watched, are those League characters?
Epic and amazing, but why would you ever go to war pregnant?? xD
This makes me want to play ranked and go on  a 10 lossing streak
Nah, malarda
I can hear T1 fans crying
Alguém entendeu alguma coisa?
Necrit we need you
I can’t wait to download this for my gym workout playlist
It's amazing how kindred makes every cinematic much better.
For some reason, this cinematics does not cause any feelings, the previous cinematics was a thousand times better and the vocals and stories that were shown in it are just beautiful, which cannot be said about this video.
Faker doesn't have a tribute song, and the new champion has a song. 😅😅
since when pantheon is noxus
Que coisa maravilhosaaa!!
I love it sooooooo beauty
kindred didnt revive her. kindred's omega blessing to ambessa's child inside her revives her
Stunning and Brave.
Possible this will be part of for the Worlds 2024 opening ceremony alongside with, I'm still here Season open anthem, Arcane theme performance, and  Linkin Park as Worlds Anthem Heavy is the Crown.
neuron activation
So... Kidred revived Ambessa and now Mel has some kind of magic with her? Riot gameeeeeeeeees stop coooking
OKEEEY DREAMGIRL
Let's goo 🔥
مثل كل مرة رسم وتحريك جدا رائع وبالإضافة الئ الموسيقى والاغنية الي فد شي عاشت ايدكم riot 👍
Couple of things.. I think: - Ambessa is fighting the wolf and the lamb grants her raspite - The one-eyed spectres in Kindred‘s vision might have a connection to Jhin (or why he wears a one-eyed mask). - She is pregnant at the end - In the vision she is fighting someone who looks like Pantheon but I think she is fighting someone who has gotten Lamb‘s raspite before - The small lamb might represent the unborn child?
Is she illaoi?
U telling me Jinx is facing this? Good f@cken luck!
ff 15
KINDRED
LET THEM COOK!
FOR NOXUS!!!!!
Better than the LP song 😂
Wow riot gave us a song with a good animation out of nowhere, weird...
Goosebumps 👁️👄👁️✨
THIS, IS, ABSOLUTLY, INSANE !!! Wonderful work, huge, congratulation to the entire team!
I just can't wait for season 2. Thank you !
FORTICHEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Omg Kindred looks so cool!
This song is so good. Omg. The character designs, visuals, everything was amazing. Also, the design of the drums being used are so nice aesthetically. I forget that Kindred takes on different appearances in different regions and Kindred looks beyond ethereal.
So this explains that Mel has powers?? 😮
She didnt dash once in this vid - literally unwatchable 😉
the most beautiful non sense animation i never saw before
ABSOLUTE CINEMA
Muito doido, estarei esperando o vídeo do necrit pra entender as referências.
And now we wait for necrit
I can't wait for the 1 hour long Necrit Video, explaining every single detail/ easteregg. I love that everything is Canon now and with that nothing they show is "random" or "just a style they use" to show us something.  Well done to everyone who participated in the making of that video!
thời đại mới đã đến
IS THIS PANTHEON ???
entao ela estava gravida
After listening to this song, I grew hair on my chest and a mustache on my face.
Is ambessa pregnant?
Good one, but still prefer the varus vid.
Pop off Barbara
Better Worlds Song.
Pantheon,swain, Katarina, kindred,ambessa
what if the effort put on this video was on the worlds music video
Why everyone keep saying "Kindred" and Swain? They didn't appear anywhere in the video, saying the wolf "Kindred" is kinda a reach don't you think?
trash
♥♥♥♥
AMBESSA!!!
The Glowing baby si probably Mel Medrada
내 피땀눈물~
Ok I'm gonna need a 50 minute Necrit explainer video for this one
I'm a simple person: there is Kindred in the cinematic, here is my like.
well, now we can confirm how big the disparity between the balancing team and the cinematic team are
Ну даже не знаю, как то все смазанно, прошлые ролики были на 12 из 10, этот на 7, что для команды роликов ну прям очень низкий результат. Скатились?
YUCK.
3:02 I'm confused, this is a Wakanda Forever champ?
It's not good, it's irrelevant
absolute cinema
i have no idea what i just watched, but that was such a trip
3:41 “A wolf has no mercy.”
This mv is better than Linkin Park MV.
Great song and visuals! Animation and art direction 10/10
that kindred legendary is gonna be INSANE
im so early straight up fire
amazing animation as always
이게 ㄹㅇ롤드컵 뮤비같으면 개추
Oh, i cant wait for the 40 minute necrit video.
월즈 뮤비를 이정도로만 뽑았어도 욕은 안쳐먹었겠다 이 미친놈들아 잘하는 놈들이 왜 월즈 뮤비만.....
OMG
I don't get how people like Ambessa. Such an unlikable overrated character
Nah Kindred got nerfed or what.. It missed Trynda It missed Ambessa   And I just did a penta against her
le poulet de DINGUE
So this is what the riot balance team does
Làm MV hay hơn cả làm game 😂😂😂
i hope the animators dont get laid off after this
ART!
ok I'll play another soloq
Its nice to give a wolf some spotlight while some other champions just didn't have a place in Runeterra yet.
저작권 좀 어떻게 해봐 이 망할 놈들아...
So lost but this is nice😂
Can we stop this DEI BS? Enough is enough.
Necrit must make an hour video on this
Seeing Kindred in a different region with a different aesthetic is pretty dope. I'd like to see every region/culture's version of Kindred.  Also, the Necrit video on this will be a banger I'm sure.
🔥🔥🔥
2:33 Swain, Katarina, and Pantheon?? Is this like a vision on her future...? or past? Overall I get strong Shurima / Targon / Noxus vibes
nah Riot have COOKED with this! How can I be hyped for more champion releases if they aren't going to stay to this level.
Ofereceu o filho para que pudesse viver hummm
Seems Oddly familiarrr.... "A wolf has no mercy"
10 times better than the worlds song
Wtf did i just watch😂
Why isn't it the song of the worlds 2024 ? WAY better than heavy is the crown...
riot give them a raise, NOW!
lol is cooking with music like always 🔥🔥🔥
LA PITA MAMA
this makes more sense than linkin park's 30 secs frame
KINDRED???
Is that Pantheon????????
aka this is a musical number from the Upcoming Arcane S2 thats shows the Back Story of one of the main characters in 2S, HYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYPE!
It's giving James Bond wibes. Gorgeos
this should've been the worlds 2024 anthem
Riot is truly the best music/film company I've ever known
❤💥
Ambessa got her own MV , T1 got Linkin Park lmao
good
Did the wolf get her pregnant?
They look like the corrupted targonians i saw pantheon, swain and Katarina with rakkorian armors holy
Boring! Another masterful MV and another banger of a war song from the music company that promotes their game.
Ambessa was trained by the Shuriman Ascended that's corrupted by Naafiri?
Is that Panth, Swain, Ambessa and who's the other one? Kata?
What a dumb video. And music 😂. Wtf
BANIU O BAIANO CARALHO
So cringe, btw
OH MY GOD SWAIN
gg good
Need the Lore explanation guy !
dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash dash
Mid
3:38 Is that Mel... Inside Ambessa's womb??
She looks like Shadow of the Erdtree Deathknights
Necrit is gonna have a field day with this one
Twiglit 😂
This is how you tell a story of a strong female character, Hollywood.
Honestly, hardest music video of the year by far.
There's so much background lore going on I'm bracing for a 50 minute Necrit video
The animation is actaully so fire, I didn't even know you could go out of focus for animations its wild
Peakkk
First Vietnamese
❤ i love this Song and this background Stories
Literal Chills! Can't wait!
Yow this is Fire
THIS IS SICK
so good
This is amazing and the animation is crazy
Im just.... genuinely speechless........  Just amazing
why did I think BTS and Riot somehow made a collab😭
판테온스킨 기대되네
So is this ambbesa ?
banger !
Been a while since we got a banger music video for a new champ release 🎉
This definitely gave me goosebumbs
We really NEED that mask on Ambessa
Mdarda, swain, pantheon and katarina ?
So skinline ambessa pantheon katarina and swain?, the music goes so hard tho
Wtfffffff, I’m sorry riot but 🥱🥱🥱
Hard stuff
Holyyyy
Kindred is just too OP. I love it when these insanely powerful force of nature champions finally show up in lore.
4 min ago huh?
🔥🔥🔥
This music is much better than world music.
The song is so FIRE omg
Necrit where are you?
Poggers
Better than 2024 World song
Absolute Cinema!
Really Cool RIOT
Once again Riot proves that they are indeed a music company that does games on the side. Top tier stuff!
Is this arcane? Too black and disappointing
Insane wtf
Cinema
Nice
ALL THESE COMMENTS WHEN THE VID WAS OUT 2 MINS AGO DIDN'T EVEN WATCH THE WHOLE THING
Pantheon?!
This  looks crazy good
more than 200 years balance:)
Its aight
This is so dope
bro as soon as I saw kindred popping up I fell of my chair. Main them for years. favorite all time charakter. Honest reaction YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
LET'S GOOOOOOO BOISSSS!!!🔥🔥🔥
Ох какое красивое видео
oh our necrit i really need some in depth analysis with this MV               (I'm just kidding y'all don't be mad)
Es cine 🎞️🎥🗣️🗿
cringe wakanda DEI champ
Wtf im so early 😂
Better than world's music
Bruh This video is so lit  How about world MV 🐧
Ah yes. Riot. Music Company first. Gaming Company second.
i smell a 30 minute video by necrit
gosh man the animation
Better than World MV
Is that a new skinline i see?
Majestic
Riot cooked and served 🎉❤
i will never get enough of Fortiche animation style 😍
Can't wait for necrit to turn this into a 35 min video analysis
trash
2:27 is that Katarina 👀
dreams during afternoon sleep :
Cant wait for Necrit to explain wtf is happening.
The reason why Heavy Is The Crown ruined the music video: Too much force was put into this video.
Infinitely better than this years Worlds music video
It's been a while since we last had a new champion music video and I'm all for it!
DA SWAIN YOOOOO !!!
In the thick of it.
Wow Worlds 2024 theme song
So beautifull ad Kindred was so coool and beautifull aaahhh thx Fortiche for your talents !!!
This is so clean. Shout-out to the crew behind this masterpiece.
first
It has finally arrived
This is good but i am still little bit afraid about Linkin Park performance at worlds... Hope for no pathetic playback like last years at worlds from lil nas and new jeans
So she is a leader in Noxus but comes from Shurima?
Magnificent.
THE SONG IS BANGER
S W A I M N <3
Wow 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I was here
I was waiting for Linkin Park to make an appearance I'm very disappointed.
This might be the best song they can offer in 2024 ❤ everything looks on point
mid
Videogame company?   Music video company
Masterpiece!
Riot Entertainment never let me DOWN !!!!
이번 곡도 미쳤다 너무 좋아
Assim surge uma guerreira ❤
La mejor presentación de un campeón "superó la senna"
Kindred ambussied her soul back

3:40 Wait, did Kindred ulted Ambessa and ..... her unborn child? Holy....  (For non League viewers : Kindred Ult marks out a zone that prevents death for allies and enemies within it & heals 300 HP to all within when duration ends)
Blood sweat and tears is a BTS song
