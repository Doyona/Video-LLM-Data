Here we go, my bimonthly check in on that spanking we gave Boston.
one of my favourite comebacks
Towns stayed healthy all season last year for the Knicks
New York has the better garden arena not Boston 😂
I never thought the Knicks would eliminate the Boston champs
For those of you watching this years from now. Pacers ended up beating the Knicks in the next round. The Finals ended up being Pacers vs Thunder. It was boring. The Eastern Conference playoffs were more entertaining. 06/18/2025
❤❤ I Love Knicks ❤❤
Maybe the Knicks can rehire Thibs since they owe him money anyway and dont have a plan to replace him.
❤❤I Love The Knicks ❤❤
7:45 watch Brown get yanked by his arm away from that rebound.. They wanted Boston to lose this series so bad
LET'S GO KNICKS!! 🧡💙🏆
Mistake by a coaching staff.home court advantage.❤
I'll never forget I went to watch Thunderbolts the day this game was played and was so surprised at the end of the movie to see NY had took the game in OT. Start of a great series.
6:51 Jason Tatum the THREEE
6:51 Jason Tatum for three!! Lol
New York City is a Sodom & Gomorrah
Tatum took 4 steps 1:58
OG and Brunson is on fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
yerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr 172!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WASH Heights!! KNICKS WE HERE, they counted us out..
Kevin Harlan puts life into the game!
Champs are lacking without a center not having porzingas is costing them I think it’s a knicks sweep coming either knicks or pacers out the East
T 4:58 Jalen Brunson ? I’m pretty sure you mean Jaylen Brown😂
I’m glad the NY refs,  found homes in Boston.   What a joke.   I’m happy for NY in fighting, you win should deserve without help from all the refs.  Let’s talk NY,  teams in Last 10 years Steven A    Garbage.   1/2 the games they have won across every sport.   Was due to this.    Celtic nation,   NY you just poked the bear. Your gonna get swept.   This was bull.   See ya NY Knicks in another 20 years when your still not relevant.
5:53 🤧
The Celtics need a kick in the you know  what for losing two games that they should have won
10:00 is such a great example of knicks effort basketball. anunoby is under NO circumstances letting horford get that rebound
Anyone here after game 2?
That MF Jalen Brunson cold as ice bruh… I know Dallas fans heated 😂😂
Let’s go Knicks New York stand up
The fact that Bridges had his back turned on that inbound pass is mind blowing.
Jaylen brown looks like a 2k player animation glitching 😂
Celtics Fans, I’ve been saying it all year, Tatum is not him. 1 Fg in the 4th in 2 games is diabolical
10:28 love the NBA Jam "overtime" 🤣
ROUND 2 IS 🔥. AMAZING WIN FOR THE KNICKS. EMBARRASSING LOSS FOR THE CELTICS.
The underdog Knicks will soon be the upstart Knicks.
4:47 “that was a pretty play from Jalen Brunson” 😂😂😂
NY is shaking off the BUM BLUES!!! WTF is going on?!! I am loving it!!!!!
2:37 HEE HEE
I'm just happy Ime Udoka isn't coaching this celtics team anymore.  This team is so talented they won 61 games this year with their head coach basically playing with a slinky during games 😄.  They would probably become a dynasty under Udoka.
https://youtu.be/_apww3a1Rlc?si=YbB4gJL7XbyebWF-
Harlan and Reggie could do commentary for a plumber cleaning a grease trap and it would feel like cinema
Mikal Bridges made Jaylen Brown look ridiculous on that last overtime possession. Brown and Porzingis should play harder, grab that ball harder, this is playoffs, it's physical, it's tougher than usual.  Josh Hart plays with all his heart, this Knicks team's physicality and talent reminds us of the 90's Knicks (Charles Oakley, Patrick Ewing, John Starks, Larry Johnson, Lattrell Sprewell...).
Tatum should not be holding the ball in the last 1 minute ever
Damn does all Tatum do is step back and shoot 3s
Coach Joe Mazzulla wake up.why is 4th quarter is a loss for you?the important quarter is a 4th quarter.stand tall in the 4th quarter.
Worst Defending Champion and Top 2 Seed Ever 🤮 Tatum Greatest Choker of the Century
As a Pacers Fan Shout out to Knicks for taking game 1 & 2 in Boston let's go Kincks 😂😂😂😂😂
Insanity!
New York let’s thank the Detroit Piston for bringing out the beast in Knicks. We can’t be stopped. Indiana revenge is next
Go Nicks! Wow game 2 was just as crazy! 👏👏👏
If OG play good the whole series Celtics in trouble!
GAME 2 to steal the ball again to end the game is DISGUSTING😂
Did it again!!!!
the script is about to go crazy its boutta get crazy all fixed outcomes numbers all picked before the game wake up or stay sleep
Bridges is a dog first Brown then Tatum to take the ball away and win both games
Boston coach has NO control of his team. I keep praying they shoot 3's. And they did. Hope they lose the series.
omg get that robinson out! Big guy that doesnt want to play ball.
Bridges took Jalen Browns 🍪cookies bruh 🤣
12:03 game winning steal. Bridges ripped it from him with authority.
8:09 self pass travel
🔥🚒 Game 1.... Brunson is a monster
OG DONT SHOOT TO MISS
Why couldn’t Dallas help out the bucks instead of the lakers and Knicks
Celtics, we GOTTA GET IT TOGETHER!!!!!!  gotta make them shots.  40+ misses 3pointers ain't gonna get you far.  Left open drive in lanes just to shoot contested 3 pointers. Nobody was playing in the paint. Everyone was playing behind the key. Nobody was running to get open. Players just walking up and looking for a hand-off. 😂. Nobody cutting to the basket. Horrible execution and coaching game 1.  Gotta get it together for game 2.  DRIVE THE BALL TO THE BASKET.  not every shot needs to be a 3 pointer.
Didn’t know I was a knicks fan 😅 no but really good game both teams
Jaylen Brown player of the game. Moves on display; the creativity; the consistency; the flurry of moves in rapid succession; Respect in abundance.
Must be agonizing to hear Knicks fans as loud in Boston garden
We Have A Series
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The referees were fair!
AMAZING game. NY and then the Pacers vs Cav game.. man. Playoffs are amazing
Brunson is HIM.
This reminds me a little of the 90s Knicks teams hustle in the playoffs, without the hard fouls, blood and fights haha.
As a lifelong Bulls fan, in the east, I respect the Knicks hardnose team basketball. Good win and Brunson is clutch, no doubt. In the West, I like how Denver plays, 1 through 5, inside out. That said, I pray that the Finals are NOT Celtics vs. GWS. Hell nah! Not sorry because seeing 100 3s attempted between both teams plus little defense will be a snooze fest for me. Take the ball to the hoop, damn! Even Bird would be ashamed. Close games in both conferences make me wanna watch the NBA again, consistently.
How are these not carries!??!! 1:21  Have the rules changed?
They should Have just let jrue holiday guard Jaylon 😹🤦🏽‍♂️
As a knicks fan, I have grown used to these cardiac games. Gotta keep a heart monitoring machine nearby every outing.  Literally every game is like this. There's no rest as a knicks fan. Every game is a meat grinder. Whether you're up 20 or down 20, no lead is safe with the knicks
what?
Off ball movement was horrible  And had Boston look lost 😅😅
💙💙💙
READY FOR GAME 2 !!!! WE HERE 🧡💙
When you’re chuckin up threes you have no chance of getting players in foul trouble.
https://youtu.be/edMudrVE2ps?si=OOr0IRBwT7OkbCho
Lazy celtics
So the Knicks won game one. Good win. We'll take it from here.  Celtic til the End  Oh, one more thing. Don't worry NYC. We're coming. Just wait
Celtics better wake up
The NBA sucks today they just shoot 3s All game lame 👎👎👎 sucks come on man
Josh Hart is the key, he be doing all the little things that don’t show up in the stat sheets
The east is going nuts
Wild
KAT owns the 💅 emoji
Regular season record don’t mean anything 😂😂😂😂
Hell of a game!
Knicks in 6
Balagbag
Bridges is the best corner in the league
Can anyone explain to me why when the game is coming down to the wire, the ball goes into Tatum, he dribles 27 ft from the basket, in jacks up a well-defended 3. I'm not talking about this game, that's the end of every Celtics game that's close. The other team knows that he's going to do it he does it every time. And he misses every time. Brown supposed to be the other Superstar why aren't we putting the ball in his hands once in awhile, to confuse the defense. The second three was disgusting. I could have put up a better shot. The problem is is defenders draped all over on because they know exactly what's going to happen. I'm starting to feel like Tatum's a little selfish. He doesn't seem it that's the opposite of his personality, so I'm kind of hoping it's Joe. But we might as well have handed the game to them. The Drew holiday bucket, right before the score gets low enough so the ball goes to Tatum. No one even defended him. I mean when you try to run the same play again? At the end of the game nobody's paying attention to White or holiday.  I have been a Celtics fan since birth, I'm 50 years old now. I've defended him for 49 years, and now I'm sick of it. We have a better team than last year but they're playing like crap.  Right before the playoffs started I told my father the energy is not the same.  People didn't seem excited in their interviews. There were all these little bickers between all the players. I told my dad that this team can't win. Talent doesn't win continuity does. Just asked the Lakers lol
As always Tatum chokes on critical plays.
Yes! The real NBA starts this playoff! Gives me the adrenaline rush! Dime!
Tatum too many failed 3's
As a Pacers fan I just wanna "SHOUT OUT" to The Knicks for taking care of Boston in Game 1 Let's go Knicks !!!!!! New York I see you
Tatum🐊🐊🐊
Best game OG ever played on offense
Man celtics are good but boring as hell...they make the duncan spurs look like the 96 supersonics or blakes clippers.
the celtics blowing a lead at home feels so good to watch, what a miserable team and fan base
Big body  Brunson  getting gritty out here  in the post season.  What's more amazing is  that y'all stole one  on the defending champs floor as a unit.
Adam Silver is making a tons of money on this playoffs
I just see all Threes 😐
Don't look now but Indiana beat Cleveland. If it's the Knicks versus Indiana we can do this. We have some revenge to get on them.
They overlooking us!
pero que partidaso me acabo de ver
Bridges was the clutch
Game of the year
4:53 Brown
Tatum must be afraid getting scratched on painted area 😂. That's not so Kobe of him 😂
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown needs to go man 😂
Battle of Northeast interesting
So far the lower ranked teams are winning Game 1
Bruh, Brunson's crazy footwork and shaking braid head fakes are 🔥🔥🔥
Amazing game
gg ...damn! that's crazy! down by 20 and won by 3!
KAT just needs to focus on the paint more.  We all good otherwise.
Jaylen Brown cut fresh, he Killin the game now
Bridges said Gimmie that lol
Wouldn't it be gr8 if these OVERPAID BASKETBALL PLAYERS PLAYED THE REGULAR SEASON THIS HARD EVERY GAME. GTFOH
He did the "sleep" too early. But good game all around
F the Celtics
awesome win by NY, really liking their squad this season but to be honest. I still think Boston will win the series unfortunately, they had a bad game and in order for NY to win, Brunson needs to pop off every night, which will be tough against boston's defense.
boston should rotate their players
I'd like to define it as a league where the average of 3-pointers has been leveled up. no matter how many teams have superstar players, they can't become champions unless having a  good 3-pointers. now NBA is age of 3 pointers
I really enjoy the 3 point shooting contest. Boring as hell to watch.
Go New York  Go New York Go! NY Knicks are 💯 % heart and are destined to win.
NY, PLEASE GET CELTICS TF OUT OF HERE, WE DO NOT NEED MORE TATUM CRINGEY CELEBRATIONS LOL
76 since the Knicks won a championship 😮
45 missed 3's.  From one team!  The NBA is a mess.
THE KNICKS STOLE THE SHOW 🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Celtics beat themselves.. don't forget they had a 21 point lead... lack of defense to hold that lead is detrimental
0:00 I skipped ahead in the middle of the video & went backwards 😂
what an incredible game!  These playoffs are rockin
Brunson🔥🔥🔥
They one off hustle and grit…Coming back from a 20 point deficit 👀💪🏾💯👏🏾👏🏾
Call me crazy but og n bridges as a pair is not far from Tatum and brown
Go Go Go boston
https://youtu.be/YJrTRXy6r5A
Wow New York come back was amazing 👏👏👏
Go Knicks
I don’t think jb is a pro
Please god... I want the warriors to win. But most of all I don't wanna watch Tatum go through a bunch of other people's celebrations again. So lets go Knicks!
Worst thing Celtics could have done, is let the knicks get behind early....sum bout it!
They are not the Warriors. Towns gave them hard time on his offensive rebounds.
OG was hooping, if he stays at that level this series and Kat picks it up just a little, bro they might be on to something, and as a suns fan its good to see Mikals hustle get highlighted on the big stage
Wow! Seriously, get the ball outta Tatum's hands during the final seconds of regular time! lol
Now this was a game worth watching
Dame Knicks ain't playing.
anunoby, siakam   we the north
Brunson was crazy with it and the defense stepped up. Tatum lost it for the Celtics. 3 missed 3s in the 4th did it for them smh.
I love my Knicks.
As a Suns fan so happy for NYC - BRIDGES !!
Too much ball hogging & too many missed 3's ... Tatum !!!
How that wasn't called a shooting foul
Aww shit payoffs 🥵
I don’t see the Celtics running it back this year
How did that ... I mean ... Wow. On to game #2.
The Knicks played a great tough game
AYO he said I love me some hart 😂
I don’t think I heard one foul get called in this highliht. Not saying it didn’t happen, just saying these mfs was locked in on both ends& the job got done .. regardless who one. 👏🏽👏🏽 BUT LETS GO KNICKS 🤣🤣💪🏽💪🏽
These have been the most exciting playoffs to watch in a while. Unpredictable, exciting, and hopeful for the next generation of stars that are showing OUT.
Everyone debating whos better whos the man of this team Brunson or Kat Ima say it OG better than both of them he droppin 30 for yall and playin incredible defense and he was on fire at the end of the game they should have let him take more shots when Brunson went cold and missed those like 3 in a row at the end
Jalen mf brown….🔥🔥
Finally, some real hoop
Collective Win, Knicks🔥🔥🔥
celtics in 5!!!!
It is very rare that Celtics lose 20 points winning game. High expectation effects lose enthusiasm and concentration. Don't expect again to come back win from 20 points behind vs Celtics.
I’m rooting for injuries to win I don’t wanna see either be successful I want to see career Enders for both teams
Eat Wheaties
That warms my heart. Taint-yum never fails to disappoint. 😂
LOL AT THAT!!
WE ARE GETTING BOSTON ELIMINATED WITH THIS ONE 🗣️🔥🔥
I thought porzingis got injured having only played 13mins as a starter, he can't guard quick forwards.
only Boston could choke a 20 pt lead in the playoffs
12:03 GIMME THAT SHIT, NUKKAH! 😤💪
Man the mavs really let this demon walk smh cuz!
Great game
SHocked the KNICKS won!!!
BEST KNICKS team since the 90s!!!!!!!!
100 100 u don't go for a 3 w. 10sec. Left. Knicks still won't win best of 7. 🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀
I fw with the dub but  didn’t jb didn’t get  free throw as after foul let him miss the 3rd one
BING BONG (I'm not from NY)
This is the year of the upsets...
Do these top three teams deserve to have 60 wins
Raptors fan here. I'm happy to see Anunoby thriving in the postseason, even if it's for a division rival. He's a beast and the Knicks have themselves a special team this season.
An ad every 5 seconds though? Really NBA 😑
The Knicks had no business winning this game but congrats to them for not giving up and fighting to the very end like you're supposed to do. But I still expect the Celtics to win this series even tho the Celtics played bad in the 2nd half and didn't shoot the ball well that's really the only way you can hope to beat them is hope they just have a bad shooting night and I don't expect that to keep happening because even with the Celtics shooting bad in game 1 they still had a chance to win this game and really should have won this game so that tells you how good this Celtics team is even on their bad nights they're still capable of beating the 3rd best team in the conference.
Bridgets showed up when it counted but they need more production from him!!
wtf is Tatum shooting all these 3s
Why did Tatum shoot that dumb a$$ contested three pointer with the game tied at 100? This is why I root against Boston. They play stupid basketball shooting the damn 3's when your not even supposed too.
😐😐😐
Honestly one of the best nba games ive watched
NY has to stop missing fts though. Thats insane how many they missed. Its was 14-28 at one point
Refs saved them in was post to shoot 3 free throws
See how exciting playoff basketball has been without LeBron meddling with competition through his bs? Basketball is back baby!
"Their ability to knock down 3s" really jinxed them buddy 😂
THE KNICKS ARE HOT. THE KNICKS ARE HERE. AND THIS IS OUR FREAKING YEAR.
This was a very emotional win for my Knicks team I will Remember this game for the rest of my life I literally cried when we one this win means alot
A shooting contest. Brunson vs Celtics. Jalen wins
"There ability to knock down 3s"... 😂😂😂
Sorry this game sucks. It’s just a 3 point contest with a running clock. There’s no game, no style, it’s just chuck it and repeat.😐
Why did the intro give me chills tho
I'm a pistons fan but I can't lie, the Knicks play good ball and make for exciting games. Best of luck to yall in the rest of the series.
What a game
celtics are their own enemy. they are killing these bums by 20 and they start shooting threes, cause they feel comfortable..  giving them momentum.
Well done
This is a classic.
Tatum always choked
Kevin Harlan is so good
@2:20 and @2:38 Kornet out here lookin like the white Shaq 😂
Took our worst shooting night and no KP for them to win by 3 😂
Tatum overrated. Always the sidekick lmao
what a story but Celtics will probably dominate game 2
that looked like it should have been 3 free throws for Brown
This the best version of knicks since the 90’s honestly, salute to my hometown team even though I grew up a Bulls fan and still to this day, one thing in common we don’t like Boston sports
🏀🌮🔥
Okay Knicks, impressive first win in the series.
Lfg NYC
Celtics trash!! Lol.. they blew a 20point deficit. They’re not repeating anything 😂
NYK are missing to many free throws . 😩
How was that foul on Jaylen brown called on the floor?
Go Knicks grab another one in Boston!
Go Knicks!
Amazing game and that was just game 1 lol
Love Brunson!
NYK shut them down in the 4Qtr ngl Boston y’all player’s had a big ass lead in the 2Qtr also 3Qtr as well frfr blew the game the eastern team do have talent over there 👉🏾 a lot of it no joke Cavs also Pacers Knicks so many other teams too with duo then the Playoffs is really young player’s that’s talent different crossover moves great 👍🏾 good 😌 shooting percentage clutch player’s that can take over games or series
Brown just not it no more 😂😂😂🤦🏾‍♂️
What a game! The Knicks have GRIT!
Nyk win one game and the fans act like its over thats Boston out there stay humble
Good steal nyk
This is the camera angle NBA ❤
Best Knicks win ever. An instant classic for those who believe.
what a game🥲🥲🥲
THAT--coming from 20 down--late in the 3rd QTR--on the road--against the defending NBA champs--was a damn impressive win!
Tatum always chokes on clutch moments 😂
NY there's hope..... Rebellions are built on HOPE !!
Enjoy it now Knicks fans, that will be the last game yall win in the playoffs.
beat BOSTON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I said it before, say it again - Tatum Sucks!
We did it!!! Choker😂
NBA IS ALL JUMP SHOTS!!!! THAT'S ALL IT IS...NOBODY IS DOING MOVES , SHAKE N BAKE...SWEET MOVES..TAKING MF'S TO DA WHOLE...
good to see NY on the series
1:05
Mikhail ripping the ball at the end was ice cold. knicks looking for real
The Celtics ability to knock down 3’s but preceded to miss 45 of them 😅 0:40
I'm a brand new Knicks fan screw the 76ers
Lol took the ball from Brown in the last sec. They might get into this series for sure 😂
Choking on passes story of these Celtics
Celtics shot way too many threes no movement to the basketball or plays ran! This is ridiculous
They did it to my pistons almost every game, very resilient team and my favorite to win it all. Idk where they would be without Brunson, he's so clutch
Knicks let the Celtics gassed them self in the 3rd quarter. But them threes going keep the Celtics close
Knicks/Pacers in ECF
THAT WAS A GAME!
Celtics just quit
I thought "We want Boston" meant sweep for celtics???  LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
DO THEY STILL CALL TRAVELING IN THE NBA 9:30 TRAVELING SMH😐😐😐😐🤨🤨🤨
4:31 (pause)
I been saying all year knicks if fully healthy are as good as anyone in the league. I know it's only one game and will be a tough series but they might have a magical run.
Og is a dawg
Knicks broke my heart way too many times. Not falling for it ever again. Respect to Brunson though. He is embodiment of NY grit mentality. They will however in knicks fashion get very close to making history then completely self destruct for idiotic reasons. Trust and believe this. Death taxes and Knicks screwing shit up. The 3 guarantees in life.
Bridges is colddddd
Derrick White ovr on 2k needs to be a solid 90 fr he deserves it😮, 7:22 that’s was cold 🥶 then the pass with the assist fire 🔥, 8:53 dam Jalen the crossover step back 3 was hard as hell tho 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Anuoby is ridiculous
Tatum was laying some serious bricks from 3 late in this game.  Maybe find another way to help your team after the third brick in a row?  Some of those shots were not even close.
Just WOW! 🤩🤩🤩  I *LOVE* when the playoffs are competitive!!!
Bronx born in 83. Knicks fan since 10. This is going the whole way. Nothing can go wrong in regard to minutes played and play production. Also, watch out for Jrue from now on. Lol.
Wow! Whatta game.
This is unbelievable. I know  Mavericks miss him
One of the best Knicks Games My Eyes Has Ever Watched 🔥🔥🔥🔥💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
The Celtics are full of themselves because they have the title  "undefeated champions." They try to intimidate the other teams, but forget that this is the NBA, and every team wants to win the chip.
Bridges with some crucial defense
Go getum Knicks!! It's long overdue
what a game......this is what we call a playoffs
So happy to see Mikal play good. Man's been overlooked for so long. Just a hooper
Tatum is just not that guy. He is clearly in a class below the other greats of this league. Just don’t got that dawg
i am so proud of the knicks.... there fans deserve this
I just love it when Reggies laughing so much- just a dude enjoying some good basketball on the broadcast 😂😂
I hope the Knicks beat up Celtics my ex was a Celtics fan n she left a good ASF loyal guy f her
8:15 the moment the Knicks momentum swung
Yes, the Celtics took way too many threes but the main thing is they had them in foul trouble in the first half by taking the ball to the basket also and they could have totally kept Brunson and Town’s on the bench for the second half if they would’ve played hard and smart and gotten them into worse trouble or found out, but they bailed them out by shooting a stupid amount of three-pointers. Bad basketball.
Mikal with a clutch steal at the end! Wow this game gave me chills. Celtics were well rested but the Knicks played harder, hats off to Bridges, 51 minutes of play and sealed the game.
Good game
Can anybody explain to me why Dralithon is so Ass? Got both games wrong and lost me $1k. Sheeeeeeee
All left handed are the best❤❤Ginobili before now Brunson of NY
celtics are gona come back explosive on game 2 . that was embarrassing .  celts in 5
NEGROS MEXICANS NATIVE AMERICANS 12 TRIBES OF JACOB WE ARE GOD CHOSEN PEOPLE THE TRUE HEBREW ISRAELITES OF THE BIBLE RESEARCH NO PORK LOBSTERS NO BOTTOM FEEDERS 💯💯💯💯
Knicks in five 😊
Game 1 was SO good!  What a game! Wow! Go Knicks! Go underdogs!
Wish the NBA highlights were a little longer and included a little more of the good defensive plays. Lots of blocks, steals, and missed shots due to good play are not included in this and those are just as exciting!
Ny is 3 wins away from the city  getting destroyed if the knicks beat the Celtics uts game over
JB and the Knicks are in trouble. This is not sustainable throughout the series.
These playoffs are magical.
1:07 Josh Hart with a diabolical move on the unicorn HOLY
2:45 coach need to cut that lil hair off 😂
Let’s Go Knicks!
The celtics and cavaliers are just a cakewalk
Im sure Stephan A Smith is going crazy about this win
Great game white and Brunson was hooping
Okc , cavs  and Celtics having the same kind of loss,
These 3 fest games are what makes the NBA 🗑️🗑️
WHO EVER WIN GAME ONE AWAYS WINS THE SERIES....
Celtics are trash 😂😂😂
PEAK HOOPS
Get physical with the Celtics and they can’t hang. Keep your foot on they necks Knicks also Jalen Brunson is so underrated top ten player in this league right now
All the Celtics do is shoot threes they have no paint offense. That's what will cost them the game
Thank you OG and Mikal
Brunson face after the final buzzer: jobs not finished
Boston game boring as all get out.  Strategy in a nutshell, pass the ball few times standing beyond the arc, jack up a 3.  60 3’s WTF. They may win the series but has to be the most boring team to watch.  Plus with all those jacked outside shots Boston is soft.
OMG!!! TO BE A CHAMPION  YOU GOT BEAT CHAMPION  WAY GO KNICKS!!!
What a GAME!!..DEFENSE, OFFENSE, & NO WHINING "continually",nor FLOPPING!!
NEWWWYAWWK 😂. This is playoff basketball
Please let this be an indication of how great this series is going to be...!
JT kept settling for 3s. It’s so annoying to watch h because he’s jacked and 6’8. Bro drive to the rim 🤦🏽
Statement victory. Knicks up 1-0, now we got a chance! LFGK!
Brunson x OG🔥🧑🏻‍🍳
8:11 you turn the ball over in the 4th with 7 minutes left… IN A 2 POINT GAME… and don’t hustle back on D to defend it??? This why mfs don’t like tatum… Kobe would never…
Nah bridges need his flowers that save & the end where he ripped it from Jaylen’s hands that’s tough but Bruson need to stop missing those easy lays
Boston need s to hit there shots
Awesome game hopefully new York Knicks win this series
Show some defense on these highlights!
If golden state get eliminated, the knicks getting a ring!!!!
10:43 OG almost 😮😮😮
bRUNSON IS A BEAST
With out refs help bostonis having a hard time😂😂😂😂
Nice game! 🔥🔥🔥
Derrick White is a great player
Brunson is Definitely Mr Clutch of This Season ☄️☄️☄️☄️☄️
Og 3s ☄️🔥
Shooting 60 3-pointers and only making 15 is just wild🤔
As a Raps fan I miss playoff OG so much 😢
CELTICS CHOKED A 20 PT LEAD WITH 5 MINS LEFT IN THE 3RD - BOSTON FANS COPING HARD LMAO
The greatest Knicks win in the past 25 years imo
Knicks sweep if they can make Celtics to miss 45 or more 3s in each game.
Ref blew the whistle for the foul on towns as brown was shooting yet it was ruled before the shot... 🤷‍♂️🤔🤷‍♀️
⚖️
Wins like this makes me so proud to be a New Yorker!!! Game 3 at the Garden is gonna be CRAZY!!!!!
i love it when a team up by 20 acts like the game is over.😐 all the posturing and high fiving over a rebound is lame.🤦‍♂ it didn't win the game, why the cartwheels?🙄 ha😂ha🍻😁✌😎
Fire Nico!!!!!🤣😂
I looked up the score and seen they was down 20 and I didn’t even turn on the game smh 😪 missed out on a good one
Mitch Robinson better figure his shit out .
15-60 on 3 for Celtic haha choker
JB vs Tatum, since the old days 🔥
I didn't know Brunson could ball like that. Knicks have a chance.
series could definitely go to 7 if bridges learned how to play
First off let me say Tatum is a good basketball player , but doing 4th quarter game 1 vs Knicks he didn't show it at all ,  looked terrible, because u have a good 8 inches on Brunson....and u did not go in the hole or post up non against him 4th quarter,  it's  like he was looking just for 3's and that's it , and knowing the 3's was not falling .  The rest of the Celtics doing same thing jack up 3 points attempts....brick after brick , if the 3  not falling what do u do .....GET TO THE PAINT ,  draw fouls get to the line .   Boston kept trying to shoot 3's if it was like they were down and they were up by 20 points .... Missing those many 3's turns to what .....NY fast break and getting them points they did . .   Boston all around the 3 line steady jacking up bricks and rather go to paint they steady try to jack up 3 wow .  U blame the players and they coach for that mess.  NY stand up,   bcuz of what Boston did wrong don't take away of u guys guarding them in late 3rd and especially 4th quarter and getting them missed 3's and going fast break before Boston defense sets to score n score ....
Word of caution to Knicks fans: we did what you guys pulled off last night vs the Warriors in G1 in our first NBA finals appearance with our core. Enjoy this one. The team with more experience might end up taking this series too just like the Finals in 2022. Can’t have a bad night here on out, Celtics had several vs the Warriors and lost that series in 6. Still hurts.
Karl anthony towns plays like a big man now.. thats the difference. We see you Karl. Much respect 🙏
Reggie “oh yeah!!  I mean no.”  Ha
Tatum stop taking 3’s when you have a foot taller advantage!!!! This is what’s wrong with the game today !! Brunson shouldn’t be able to stick you. Take it to the basket!!!!
The defense for miles and anunoby in the 2nd half and can't forget the impact created by josh all through the regular season and now when it matters the most.
Letsssss goooooooo knicksss
Fuc boston
This was A GAME!
damn bruh this aint the usual celtics
Celtics need defense.
HOW TF DID THE KNICKS WIN
Both the Eastern Finals and the Western Finals have been unpredictable and I’m loving it!
Raptors legend OG
celts suffering from 3pt fatigue by the end their
Brown not getting free throws on the foul on the 3pa is diabolical officiating by the refs.
As a Celtics fan we defeated ourselves we always get to comfortable with big leads
What a came back and won the game by the New York Knicks!
Commentators: Kevin Harlan, Reggie Miller & Allie LaForce.
How do you let someone TAKE THE BALL FROM YOU with 3 seconds left. What was that!??? That was pretty soft, you can't win like that!!
Love the fact that Tatum lost them the game by being a selfish player! Jajajaja
Hate the Celtics game of shooting nothing but 3s. It’s boring and frustrating to watch. Go Knicks in 6.
Wow and Brown was definitely fouled by Bridges, while shooting a three point shot @the 11:53 Mark. VERY interesting refs.... Wonder if they got $ on the game
Boston forgot they are not playing The Magic. NY is a team that consistently comes back from behind. Seems they were not ready for the assault and resorted to (as usual) throwing bombs from 30 feet.
NY knicks and Brunson said we still here
Nice oneeeee
Both underdogs win in game 1!! The Knicks and Nuggets!! 👀🔥
1:05 THAT MOVE BY HART OMG 😭🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn good game though!
Let's go new york
It's funny when Kevin Harlan is hyped when NY makes buckets while he does not have some energy when it's the Celtics 😂 Kevin Harlan a NY Fan
Stop saying trade Bridges when he contributed to so many wins defensively!
Should've been a jump ball between Pritchard and Hart or whoever. In my opinion. Interesting
Side note, Kevin Harlan is AMAZING.
anunoby the celtics killer
What is OPIE aka number 11 doing out there for the TRASH-CELTS!?!? He was BBQ chicken out there! LOL
I just feel like Boston doesn’t really have that dog in em. Knicks got it. That defense in the second half was locked
Bridges 👀 👀 👀   God daaaaayum. Put brown under his arm and said, next time lil bruh
Knicks beat them at there own game it was basically a 3 point shooting contest Boston is known for letting teams hang around should have put the Knicks away early
aaron rodgers is stillt he goat. WHO IS TINGUS PINGUS
Great win for the Knicks. But moving forward in this series they have to get KAT to put up atleast 10 three point shots a game. He’s they best shooter. Let Celtics shoot all the threes they want and Mitch needs to practice his free throws. Also you can see for the off season how a couple players like a Bruce Brown and Vucevic can really put this team over the top.
👏
Knicks well coached team. Disciplined and determined
Raptors fan watching OG... Yeah this is him at the peak of his powers. Go on
KNICK are on FIRE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ganda Ng laban.. ❤❤
When Pritchard is on the floor for Boston, the Knicks need to make sure he is always matched up with Brunson on offense and Defense.
Who would've thought that both the Cavs and Celtics would lose Game 1... LEGGO NYK!!!
Indiana takes game 1 in Cleveland. Knicks take game 1 in Boston. Wild.
most of the games so far were so entertaining to watch.. Specially those hard fought wins
3:22 3:43 why does Mcbride keep going under the screen? He's a better defender than that.
Hart is a liability vs Brown, but OG and Brunson have clear advantages
Hey Boston not everyday is Christmas day😂😂😂
Tatum was totally out of gas during OT. Sloppy defence, allowing putbacks, making bad reads, nearly throwing it away, missing shots. Did he have a cold or something?
mashed Potatum
Machine is a Brunson
LFGK
Jayson Tatum is pitiful
Great to see the Celtics lose in their Garden. The fans think they're invincible there.
This Knicks team was built for the playoffs. So happy to see OG shine! Mikal too! This is going to be a fantastic series! And I wouldn't be surprised if New York won!
Tatum is overshadowing Brown.
Let’s Goooo!!!!!!!!
This will be a long series the first round playoffs was trash hopefully these 2nd rounds shaping up to be better 👀👀
Losing at home with a lead of 20 is insane!!!!!!! LETS GO KNICKS!!!🟠🔵
Boston lost because of Tatums 3 point attempt with seconds left. Selfish play and it costed the game. Terrible shot choice. With seconds left and time to create an open basket he decided to pull a contentested 3 pointer smdh.
Bro, Brunson may be the best player in these playoffs so far!!!
I love that they do the city view at the beginning of highlights!!!
Love to see raptors players thriving wherever they’re at. OG 🇨🇦
Boston is a boring team offensively, but there defense led by White and Holiday is legit. But still I dont want to see another finals just pulling-up 3s. Good win NY.
Wasn't expecting a babyface Reggie Miller to root for the NYK, but we all know NYK/IND ECF would have some old-school magic behind it
It's raining 3 point shots.
Happy to see al horford still dunking the ball!
Hope Knicks stay healthy 🙏
THANK YOU.MIKAL BRIDGES, FOR   TELL JAYLEN BROWN, WITH,   .6 SECOND TO PLAY, YOU CAN'T PLAY, WITH YOUR BALL 😂 GOOD DEFENSE, LOVE IT. GO KNICKS GO.
尼克斯队❤
Brunson already passed Carmelo anthony 😭
So not one red seen OG personal foul on Horford like he got his whole arm tied up, very much so should of been a foul called, but Tatum shooting a needless three over Mitch was not high IQ he should of worked it thn went in for the 2pts
Nice game nyk
Brunson is a bad bad man 😂😂😂
60 3's attemp my god 😑 Laker's in 🖐
Im starting to envision a possible Pacers Knicks ECF throwback to y2k.  How interesting that would be.
brick pon brick a new single feat the Celtics
embarrassing how the celtics lost this game when at one point being up 20 points, this was supposed to be an easy win for celtics, congratulations to the knicks.
Both game 7 teams beat the resting team😂😂 they got lazy
If you can make it in Philly, you can make it in NYC!
Tabum will be back to owning corn business in Cancun 🤣😭😂😭😂😭😂😭
The Villanova connection!
Knicks vs Warriors #NBAFINALS 🤞🏽🤞🏽
How was the foul on Brown at the end not free throws?
These playoffs have been amazing
What a game!!!
Oh, this is going to be the most lit series of the NBA playoffs!
tatum isn't born for game winner
hart give and left everything in the court
Let’s go Knicks
Ive never seen a team lose a game so bad by taking a ton of wide open 3s. I guess that happens ehen you dont make any of them
OG is a beast. Damn !!!!
Brown can't let Bridges snatch the ball from him for game man 😂😂
What a come back 🧡💙🧡💙
Jalen "Clutch" Brunson
It's so obvious that none of these men want to talk to a woman during a game..lol
And to think Dallas got rid of Luka and Brunson 😮😂😢
They didnt know what to do in the dying seconds of the OT considering they are the defending champs.
This young roster deserves something
Knicks in 4!
You know I'd rather have the knicks play catch up than being up 20 at 3rd. They always lose that lead in the 4th and it's better for blood pressure.
Derrick White has been the Celtics best player this playoffs. Shoutout to him for playing his ass off but they aren’t repeating if Tatum and Brown don’t step up specifically Tatum.
OG “I don’t shoot to miss” Anunoby
#KNICKSTAPE!!!!
Celtics played not to lose in the 2nd half. Went into the prevent defense and jacked up too many 3’s. Give credit to the Knicks for coming back. But celts flat out beat themselves
28 seconds left in regulation, Tatum has OG on him, and he makes the mistake of calling Horford for a screen because now you have 2 great defenders on you
good game really would like to see knicks win it all they def deserve it.
Jason Tatum ASS
Go new york good game
NY Baby
Real finals is the western conference finals
Payton Pritchard needs to be in at the end of the game.  Kornet and Hauser need to be demoted to the G League.
New York Knicks for championship this season mark my words period
The Boston Celtics and the New York Knicks are two of the most historic teams in the NBA, with a rivalry that goes way back. They're both part of the Atlantic Division in the Eastern Conference.
Nice comeback! Lets go Knicks!
Knicks vs Wolves - Nba Finals
This entire game was epic, my goodness the intensity
WHAT A COMEBACK!
I know its a team game, but OG feels the most important to NY
You have to hit them between the eyes. Knicks need to show next game that they are boss, Tony Harding style breaking ankles, posting up and excelling at defense. Defense is the key.
If you would have told me halfway through the 3rd quarter that the Knicks would come back to win, I would have said your lying or both Tatum and Brown got hurt and left the game. The Knicks winning when the Celtics played almost flawless for pretty much 3 quarters is not a good look. This might be a really, really disappointing series for Celtics and their fans. Losing this game at home was borderline disastrous for this team. We'll see though, should be a fun series.
Why are these highlight videos 12-15 minutes long? They used to be like 4 minutes long.
Knicks are something else.
BING BONG WE TAKING IT ALL THE WAY
I love Knicks. No star player but all are contributing.
what a choke job
Brunson a stone cold killer
The anti-Brunson propaganda the Pistons tried to start is no longer working
GREAT PLAYERS AND TEAMS MAKE THING'S HAPPEN BESIDES SCORING IF WE CAN KEEP THE CELTICS FROM MAKING 3s WE WILL BEAT THEN
Ain’t gonna be a cupcake walk like last year for the Celtics
Damn how you lost to these knicks. There ass
Wow. Beat those Celtics!
LGK❤
NY will have to play BOS like DET played us. Challenge everyone and every possession
9:16 Brunson is the Beast of NY!
As a long time hater, can't believe I'm rooting for ny! According to the highlights, they need to work on rebounds* #gj
Boston blew a twenty point lead at home. Has that ever happened to Jordan?
Steve Kerr was right. Tatum should be benched at the last few minutes.
Imagine your name being Miles McBride and you letting people call you deuce? 🤦‍♂️
lol
Boston the best city
Boston is not going back to the finals unless porzingus steps up bro
O.G. a dog
Wow😮👏👏👏go newyork knicks💪💪💪
Mikal is thay kd protype haha
❤❤❤that's fukn right that's fukn right damn it N.Y BABYYYYY YESSSSSS 🎉
Knicks win Let's Go 🏆🐐🎯🙏❤🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
Last 4 NBA playoff games Warriors +2.5 Pacers +10.5 Knicks +9.5 Nuggets +9.5 All 4 underdogs won  Is the sports books dumb all the sudden or what Bet Vegas lost they ass on the spreads
Ananaouby(Misspelled) showed Championship Grit! Rooting for The Knicks!! Love From Toronto 👊🏾
BANG!!!! That's what I am talk bout Knicks have taken the monkey off they back!!! It's on like a pot of collard greens and turkey necks!! Let's Go Knicks
c'mon ref pls help boston to win🤣🤣🤣
KAT has to lock in
You let a nigga steal your cookies right out your hand for the game winner
This is gonna be one hellava series
Ganda ng laban ngayon nawala na lakers natira mga magagaling na team sarap manood walang nag pa flop
The Celtics' poor three-point shooting (15/60, only 25%) cost them the game. They should have attacked the rim more through their big men.
Watching a NBA game feels like watching a 3 point contest. I know analytics favors this style of play but I’m waiting for the team that abandons this game plan and goes back to shooting higher percentage shots closer to the basket and feeding players on the post more consistently.
Brunson 🔥
The resilient Knicks ain't neva scared ain't no quit in them Orange and Blue. Brooklyn in the bldg 👊🏾💥💪🏾
Wow 3 upsets
What happened to the 3 foul shots
Such a satisfying win for a Knick fan bc of all these big mouths like SAS saying Knicks will get swept. You gotta play the games, if Boston doesn't hit the 3s theyre beatable.
Team win, go New York!!
this is a new era. Now we see other teams leveling up.
Tibs needs the shave that mustache on his skull
OG, Bridgea and Brunson. 🔥
WHAT A GAME!!!
Reggie miller actively rooting for the Knicks the entire game was tough to watch
Knicks get their one. Celtics will take care of them rest of the series.
So what’s up with the Coaching staff allowing 60 3pt attempts? I’m seriously curious. It makes no sense when possessions means a lot in the Playoffs. I just don’t get it
The Celtics played thier worst game!!!!!!    You won by a 1 Basket...Do I have to say more??? You barely beat us at our Worst....BOSTON WILL NOW GET SERIOUS  AND PUT UP......!!!! they been playing to soft,they need to get back in the groove and remember this is playoffs..gotta play dirty basically, push ,hold,grab,trip,....whatever it takes,The REFS HAVE MORE POWER OVER THE FINAL SCORE THAN THE PLAYERS DO...HAHAHA...Freakn Ref honna ask for sneaker deal n sht...hahaa
What a defensive play at the end there. This is what basketball should be.
That took forever for NY to score in the half court
Boston is in trouble 😅😅😅😅😅
Interviewing the players or the coaches DURING play should be illegal.
Damn is this a Celtics highlight video?? Felt like they just showed Celtics highlights 95% of the video lol LFG Knicks tho
Brunson is the man 🔥 can’t forget Bridges and KAT, the whole damn team, Knicks in 6
Celtics will loose the series
Awesome. A Bad Man.
Grabe Yun 🔥🔥 knicks
THIS is a PERFECT example of what is wrong with the modern game. When you have a lead in the playoffs and you want to hold it or stop a run, you take it to the hoop and distribute to find the easier shot. Make the team that is down commit fouls, which slows momentum and pace. You slow ball them, take your time and maintain. Jacking a bunch of threes with a lead and choosing the lower percentage look is fundamentally wrong. Is this their first day playing basketball? I will say, after that tough series against Detroit, NY has to pace themselves and not get winded by game 5. They gotta keep the "nut butter in the baby basket" if they don't want premature "post-season clarity"
15-60 from three (NBA playoff record)  No Porzingis after first quarter  Tatum having a horrible second half.  Brown going 1-10 from 3.   OG had a legacy game.   Knicks shot 46% from 3  Celtics shot 25% from 3.   To still go to overtime and win by only 3 points…
This brought me to tears...the Knicks owe me a championship...for the heart break in '94...
LA LAKERS NATION SOLID MAMBA MENTALITY NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED 💪🙏💯
Lifelong Celts Fan here, and I've said it over and over for the last few years that the ONLY way the Celts can go anywhere is when they have a motion offence that snaps the Ball around to the open Man faster that the Defense can move their feet. When they do this they're Unstoppable, till then imo, they're going Nowhere with this ISO Basketball BS
Cavs boston and okc in game 1 and a home court advantage..wow
Kmpante boston
Fraudulent top seeded teams are losing left and right.
The knicks come from behind and win in OT… what a great game this is….
I think the Celtics need to shoot more 3s.
so the Celtics finally have to play a fully healthy 50+ win team in the playoffs for the first time in 2 years and they get slapped on their home floor
never give up , no matter how much your team is down!!!!!!
Celtics choke job being up 20 😂
Hart was relentless defensively, Brunson was clutch from the 3rd quarter on, and Bridges gave his all, the WHOLE game.Yet, that game WOULD NOT have been won without OG's continuous and consistent effort and scoring. He was magnificent
As a raptors fan, happy to see anunoby thriving 👌🏼 bro was key in this game
Wow, can't believe they didn't call that a shooting foul at the end
LETS GOOOOO!!!
Brown miss all 3 of the free throws at the end or what?🤔
Sheesh those step backs and hesis by Brunson, man. The lockdown defense by the Knicks around that perimeter, especially by Mikal Bridges, bro had that dawg in him. Love to see it. Definitely a classic, this had Boston in shambles.
Brown getting out muscled by Bridges is unacceptable
OG.  Goddamn.
Wow
It doesn’t matter how it gets done, my Knicks are gonna fight ! 1 down, let’s get 3 more !
Damn first the Knicks then the nuggets
Thibs not shy playing Bridges for 51 minutes 😂😂
I really wish Thibs used more bench, Bridges played 51 mins. Great NY won tho. 🤔
Boston Celtics. A team nobody fckin knows anything about 😂
Tatum don't have any skills, always tried to shoot 3s when he got a ball, the reason that's y Brown lazy to work
Wow
Derrick white is the best player on the Celtics
The bathrooms at this stadium are horrendous! They should close the stadium down as a health code violation.
Today’s NBA is trash! When literally all you do is shoot 3’s in the game it’s boring.
Brunson saved the NBA.
Wish they would stop interviewing coaches while the game is going on. Wtf is up with that
we know who the better #0 is this series! OG > JT
Brunson is a beast!!! 😂😂😂 dude had my hyped
Lucky
Wolves vs Knicks finals. Kat vs edwards
Remember the narrative "knicks can't beat the elite teams" ☕️  #knickstape
0:42 That Miller jinx came especially early this game.
Reggie miller voice is annoying is fk
Brown , let him rip that ball out of his hands. Like.takeing candy from a baby. The nicks showed they wanted it more than the celtics did.
Damn there was a lot of New Yorkers out in Boston supporting the Knicks
Villanova wins!!!!!!!!!!!!!
DEFENSE!!! Love to see it!
LET'S GOOO! I dont care how close the games are. Just win, baby!
Sorry Boston There's no Eric Lewis that can save you in this series. Good luck fighting the Knicks. These Knicks play their heart out every game. Maybe they will take this series 4-0.😊
Choketon Celtics. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
no way boston the champs let go of a lead of 20 points, the game is rigged. it would be boring if boston dominated the series. this nba finest rigging.
@4:50 i didn't know Jalen Brunson was on the Celtics
bodton playing them to level of their competition, boston much better team
D wins games.
Boston  need KP to guard towns in game 2
This game and the Denver Nuggets game had the craziest endings on the same night! I love the NBA playoffs 😅
W
Go New York Go New York Go!
OG? Nah that’s JEDI KENOBI. And yeah KAT is really like THAT. Yeah that’s BRIDGES, so cold he’s like TWIN FRIDGES, and we all know BRUNSON is Ballin, he’s out here for real not STRUGGLIN!!  KNICKS keep on COMIN’, until the CELTICS are dead in the Harbor, aka SUNKEN’!!!  🔵🟠GO NEW YORK GO NEW YORK GO!!!!!🔵🟠
Yea we came in there & punch them in the mouth let’s go 2-0 in there house sho them we not playin boys Knicks nation
Hanep mga par! 20 points lead nag-evaporate...lol!
I dont like either team, but id pick knicks to win over boston anyday
That was Amazing. NY kicked butt.
Uh oh
Nothing new from Boston, still Fkin suck at home and this is the fkin playoffs.
Team Work makes the Dream Work=NYK
🥶
dam both top seeds got beat tonight and both top seeds had big leads great comeback tonight for the underdogs
Celtics got learned again to be not cocky when the game is still. 🥶🥶😂😂
wow danger foos relax
Mr. Mazzulla, dont use too much philosophy. Rest tour main guys when you have a buffer. They start playing silly when you keep on. Knicks are coming from great series againt the bad boys. They have a lot of momentum. Dont underestimate them and give other folks some minutes. Good luck
tatum u shoot like me
So all the underdogs won in game 1 = Vegas Wins
塔图姆会打球么？
Tatum should have won most overrated over Halliburton
The Celtics need to take this seriously. Js need to wake up. Tatum you need to drive inside my brotha instead of shooting.
All I can say is what a night from the Knicks and Nuggets " championship stuff for sure 🎉🎉
jordan clarks son
MIKAL SAID "GIMME THAT SHIT"
Holy s***!  At this rate, it's gonna be New York and Denver in the Finals!
ey celtics get jordan clarkson
"CeLtIcS In FoUr" don't sleep on 'em knicks
tayum ^-^v got no help blame urselves he cant carry u guys!
tayum 3 pointer
josh learn archery im pro
We lost to OG lol
Good job knicks.. I hope you'll upset this celtics team soon in this series. Big props to all the knicks' starters especially for Mikal who played 51mins tonight and the clutch steals he made in OT's final seconds. And ofcourse Brunson and OG great performance on this game 1 of the 2nd round of the post season
Give credit to anunoby
😂😂 that's hurts Boston,
I love games broadcasted by Kevin Harlan!
The Highlights of Boston was shooting Three points only
Poll ⏰ :  Who do y’all want to win Boston or the Knicks?  And who do you want to win it all?
Brunson should of been on the Knicks in 1999
New York Knicks are pathetic lmao. Enjoy this win. Loser franchise
National Basketball of 3pointers, soooo boring to watch🥱
Kudos to the Nicks ...a great comeback
Bronson  mvp
A Knicks - Pacers ecf would be awesome because it would guarantee a finals appearance for a team that hasnt been there in decades
A complete choke job by the Celtics  Pathetic
Boring
That’s my PG. Shouts Mikal w the defense all night 💪🏾
Go Knicks as a Laker fan beat them please 🤣
What happened to you Tatum,puro kalang 3 points kahit Hindi kailangan,tuloy maraming mentis
Bridges with the night night 😂
How did celtics lose??😮
OG had the game KAT was supposed to have
8:54 9:06 9:26 10:34 10:50 12:00   These plays were so crucial for the Knicks man. LETS GO. What a win. Gonna be a fun series
BOSTON CHOOKED😅
Did you noticed that all homecourt advantage that they c Losed it, from Philippines fan of NBA.
Dallas big mistakes💪⭐trading jbrunson,a true leader,fcilatator in the system👍🖐️🥳🥳🥳
Sheeshh what a GAME 🥶
classic choke job by Tatum..   nothing new here.
huge respect to HART's HEART. Doesn't show up in the stat line but he's putting in big minutes. 11 rebounds at 6ft4 is crazy work even against Celtics small-ball
Imagine if Knicks go to the finals. NYC is not ready for that
Celtics did everything in their control to hand this came to the Knicks they shot 11% from three. JT turning the ball over.
4:53 Jalen Brunson 😂
Underdog
9:38 travel
Annanoby looks like the famous Mortal Kombat champion Ninjakilla
This Knicks team is SCARY 🥴 What a WIN! That whole team is pretty damn good but Brunson..that man is a superstar 🔥
i hope brunson wont get injured in this run ,just like what happened last year
Thibs only have about 14 strings of hair in front of of his head and their layed out with activator jell 😂  life of a stressed great coach
The clip on Brunson has unlimited ammo and to add praise to his footwork 🤌🏽
I cant stand Celtics... Tatum thought he was curry like bruh u have height take ya dumb aye in the paint u not like that fa real... kniccs got shooters too..  go ask that 20 point lead comebacc
Who’s better? Jalen Brunson or Isaiah Thomas?
STUNT on them Bean town bros
Bing bong
TOTAL COLLAPSE by the Celtics, on their home floor.  Up by 20 points in the second half, then lose in OT.
Sad loss cmon just lose the series let the knicks have it
Wow what a great game
Brunson if a monster!!!!
Thank God Boston lost. The 3 point shot chucking strategy finally backfired in a crucial game
2 banger of games today
OG worth every damn penny. Wow
Why Jalen look nervous in the thumbnail 😂
Boston not getting the same Calls as last year ig
Hearing a team take 60 3 point attempts in an NBA game is wild
Bobo tlga boston sa season game lng pla malakas haha
The Knicks turned the sliders down when Boston was in the bathroom.
all we gotta do is swarm tht 3 let them get twos if they can ,,bridges help in the paint too much leave his mans open everytime
JAYLEN BRUNSON PLAYED A SMART GAME
A day of upset wins by the Pacers, Knicks and Nuggets!
Im a lakers fan but now wishing for ny to win it all
Corny ahhh celtics
Noby and Brunson were FIRE. This is exactly what the knicks needed. Tested, blown out, and put the Celtics and the all remaining playoff teams "We are here, and we can hold the hot gates.......WE CAN WIN!"
Brunson is unreal!
Yo wtf happened to brown? He playing like he had a stroke! And of course Porziņģis goes out when u need him most🤦🏽 Tatum taking the most pointless 3s missing like 5 in a row at the end for no reason literally throwing the game. U need to know when it’s time to stop missing 50 3 pointers in 1 game and go to the rack! Joe is trash at coaching!
At this point its safe to say OG could've easily fit in with the 90s Knicks, dude is a baller
Brunson…. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Knicks roster is fun to watch!🍿
Bridges may only have 8 points but there's a reason why he was there for 51 mins. (Aside from playing for Thibs of course) DEFENSE
Knicks and Nuggets winning against the conference favorites is just mind blowing. These playoff matchups has never been this close and unpredictable for a long while now and we all love to see it.
11:56 that was a great foul! 😂
No shooting foul at the end SMH
Brunson is so clutch. Doesn’t celebrate if he makes big shots. Low-key but so lethal. I wish lakers trade Luka for Brunson.
I’m so proud of this team!!!😊
blowing a 20-pt lead at home is crazy work! LFG KNICKS
Jayson Tatum always getting discombobulated every time the game is close.. he should focus more on mid and near the rim not only rely on shooting 3s
Trash J’s better trade 1 of them or both for Flagg and trade that useless idiot as* coach Mazulla
If the Knicks play that kinda defense they played in the 4th all the time(easier said than done) they can win IT ALL!!!
The Boston Celtics are a bunch of lame ass cringe clowns
Brunson was 3/10 at one point then went lights out. Thats why you never give up 🔥 what an absolute unit him and Anunoby are.
Don’t count the Celtics out just yet. A lot of good teams, (Bulls with Jordan) went down game 1 at home. It happens. If NY wins game 2 they will win the series I’m calling it. If they lose it’s going to 7 and in that case I give the Celtics a slight edge. I hope Brunson proves me wrong.
Listen we learned here the regular season doesn't mean s**t. Knicks did what they has to do. Knicks can win the series because they are good on the road.
I was at a yankees game while the game was on and when i say the yankee fans were cheering and going crazy over the win they were chanting “let’ss goo knicksss“ you would’ve thought you was at MSG for a second 😂😂💯🔥🔥 W WIN KNICKS IN THE FINALS
J.B and O.G  went in Boston ski mask way and stole the game. Put those rings in the bag. They won the championship last year playing everyone injured.
Classic choking celtics
I just can't fathom that Brown and most especially Tatum has the advantage over the defender every single game but still not taking advantage of that situation and keeps chucking up 3's. But hey the playoffs is not over and they're still the champs. They could still win it all by this type of play.
Let's go Knicks 🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠🔵🟠
Shooting 25% from three and continuing to bomb away is certainly a choice
All 3 of these round 2 games have been crazy 🎉
It's hurt 😅🍀✨
PLAYOFFS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
In the west seed 1 lost game 1 as in the east seed 1 lost game 1 also. In the east seed 2 lost game 1 and i think that trend is different in the west because surely wolves will dominate the warriors 4-0.😜
Boston Analytics went 15/60 from 3! Cant imagine this with a team with 2 athletic 6'7-6'8 allstar duo in their prime. 60 of their 97 FGA came from outside the arc! 🤦 Somehow im glad the Knicks won. I love their style more.
og n towns coming to nyc is making wonders  will be a game 7?
WTH!... same NYK and DEN Teams = steal the game 1
"-Yes-Yes-Yes!!-"🥊👎🚫🍀🏀
I don’t care how much the media push Tatum as the face of the league, dude is not HIM!
Aye Brunson different. I still think Boston gon win it all but imma definitely watch this series.
What a choke job by the Celtics and the thunder 😂
Choke job by Boston! Great comeback!
Kevin Harlan. We want to hear your vintage call of RIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES!!!!!!
Damn we shoulda kept Brunson and trade Luka Da 🍋 sorry ahh Mannnn. Dude a killer like Micheal Meyers no facial expression type Killer. Straight Psycho
OG looked like a matchup nightmare for Boston.
Knicks coming from a wild series against the Pistons, it gave them the momentum and they're working in all cylinders in this one. Celtics blew a 20pt lead and losing in OT hits them right between their eyes.
2:45 ok but he looks like hedo turkoglu
Yeah NY 💪🏾✊🏾👍🏾🖐🏾
I...see the vision. I'll admit it.
Why would they not go for a easy 2 with last possession in the 4th 13.5 second to go 😭😭 My team on Crack 7 games forsure
Bro what is these 🥷🏿 doing on the Celtics why is some of them half awake on defense
Horrible  game to watch Celtics  shot 60 3s
scripted
KD will be coming to the  nicks next season
This gone be a serious series
Helluva game
Brown needs a pay cut
2:52 - is anyone gonna tell him? Combover headass. Let it go brother 👴
Kevin Harlan is the GOAT commentator… dude has infectious energy and makes the game 2x as watchable
A slap on Celtics fans. defending champ, MVP, big contracts... beat up by a nobody. lol
The 2025 NBA Playoffs just gotten fantastic! Y'all gon' make me lose my mind. Up in here, up in here. Y'all gon' make me go all out. Up in here, up in here. Y'all gon' make act a fool. Up in here, up in here. It's only getting better.
20 point lead blown...
They showed all the made 3 by celtics lol. Knicks literally stole the game from FMVP on last play
Knicks are trash. They'll lose the series. Choke artists by nature. I've never been so certain.
Both Boston and OKC should be ashamed of themselves.
suni lee please show up at NY home games for  Anunoby. he needs a buff
Stephen A can't wait 😂😂💯💯
Stole one out there own house which is huge. Home court advantage Knicks.
Good shit NY! Love to see it
Well, played New York
Brunson is like cp3 with Kobe mindset
JT playing hero ball again. He doesn't have to take that three. You should attack the basket man and get some FTs.
7:53 why them guys in they nose 👃🏼 like that
If you really dissect the Knicks team, they really do have a good team and the personnel to compete with and beat any of these remaining teams. If they play to their strengths and get everyone involved they’re dangerous. Brunson is going to consistently put in work, but KAT and OG are the deciding factors and if they can consistently play to their potential they’ll be hard to beat.
Its just game1.,but Tatum show'd,the reason why he is unappreciated.
Not a fan of either times but commentating was so bad
CELTICS BAD COACHING & OVER CONFIDENT !!!  Lesson learned!!!
Commentator have money on New York?? Holy f hes annoying
OG and Brunson cooked the celtics late 😂, they looked so gassed from shooting all that threes.
This knick team has no quit! Let's go knicks!
Knicks in 6
Boston with 45 missed 3 point field goal is insane.
Were there a lot of Knicks fans? Felt loud
These playoffs are turning out to be some of the best games in years
NY and Pacers is underrated team. Congrats both
10:03 bad decision for making a step back 3 Robinson guarding JT he must get to the basket he know's that he is quicker than him
Nba is so much better with LeBalco James 💉💉💊💊 gone. 👍👍👍
What a player Brunson is!!!! And what a game!!!!
9:54 nice tackle
I hope the celtics get demolished
NBA haters are saying the NBA popularity is down. Well the NBA playoff games across the league (like today's game between the Knicks and Celtics) have been SOLD OUT, EXCITING, OUTSTANDING, HARD FOUGHT and HIGHLY COMPETITIVE GAMES; in the 1st round and now the 2nd round. 👍
Interesting how all lower seeds stole game 1 . These 2nd round series gonna be crazy 🤯
Everytime I see Boston lose, I’m filled with joy knowing that Dave is fuming lmao
60 3 points shots by Celtics, this coach is pathetic to allow this to happen.
12:04 thats a LOUD ass cheer. Go new york
Three major upsets in game ones. Three home teams lost.
I taught brunson how to win like that, your welcome
OG and Josh hart r so underrated
For all you that dont know, when you catch a rebound and go to the ground, its called a travel.
Cant fking believe we beat them
5 BOUROUGHS
Crazy comeback
Brunson is higher than Carmelo Anthony as a knick
Brunson is amazing...OG was great too. Knicks playing well. NBA is exciting again.
20 points down, gritted their teeth and fought on to win! Knicks are amazing!
No respect for this guy Brunson
All the teams that had long rest lost, Boston, OKC, Cleveland, that's krazy
Am not even worry is just 1 game lol
I’m not saying Horford’s not playing good defense… Mazzulla’s gotta do something about Brunson taking the switch with Horford…
Celtics lose by 3 while missing 45 three pointers. There’s no way the Knicks win this series.
The knicks shot ther load in this game they are done now they won’t have shit left the rest of the series
Why the hell is Tatum taking 15 threes. He could easily get buckets but decides to settle
Things I be doing on 2k
Camera angle was 🔥
Boston choke😂😂
Ahhhhhh! NEW YORK!!!!!!! GREAT TEAM EFFORT!!!!
Jayson Tatum got found out😂😂😂he is shit average shooting average skills
New York stand up!
Woah, I though it would be another ez series for Boston but Knicks really outdid them
I came in late 3rd quarter to watch and i counted. Boston shot 14 3s in row after a layup attemp.
Please let this be the Knick’s year
Anunoby and Bridges were big, way to help Brunson out. Nice win NY
Big shout out to the NBA Knicks Bridges for actually showing up against the Boston. Jaylen Brownson must be the only human on Earth still delusionally whispering to himself, 'We got this… if Bridges goes nuclear.' Keep dreaming, my guy. The Celtics send their regards.
Haha tatum mia pag crucial malala overrated😂
Hell yeah
Knicks were red hot from 3 and Boston ice cold and its a 3 pt OT win.  Celtics in 5
555= VIBES
Game 1: The Collapse
NBA 3 point shooting
If this was a home game for New York fans woulda went nutz this game
All the Knicks touched the ball and made it happen in OT..that was 😎 teamwork
Shout out my Nigerian brother, Anunobi. 29pts ..... beast
Even if Celtics get to the finals they will guarantee fail against golden state in the finals
I want to go back to the regular season and avoid the Knicks.  I feel like we're going to lose.
Knicks WingStop delivered. Bridges and OG😎
That was an ugly game by Boston. Imagine shooting 60/97 from 3 point line. The team missed 45 three point shots. They can't even drive the lane after missing 3 straight three points. 6:19  LOL.
Katt had the ball standing at 7ft with a guy 5ft on him and he passed the ball😂😂😂
Knicks vs Nuggets in finals would be a fun series.
kaya nangyayare yan bobo nag design ng naia eh imagine ung parking facing sa entrance walang harang TAPOS bakit kasi Ninoy aquino yan MANILA International airport talga dapat yan mula ng naging NAIA yan naging malas na pano credit Grabber Aquino
Thibs makes a team that you want to root for. Every player counts.
Fraud Knicks got lucky cause Celtics decided to play stupid and shoot a billion 3s and made only 15 smh and that Porzingis and Houser were both out to and Knicks didn't even play great themselves Celtics did this to themselves and THEY NEED TO STOP SHOOTING THE 3S all the time if they do this again in game 2 then they desreve to lose this series enough with the 3s already jeez that why the Knicks got back into it but hey Knicks only won by 3 with the Celtics playing terrible so Cs in 5 still plus Celtics are better on the road then at home anyway oh and Knicks still aren't legit since they didn't beat a fully healthy Celtics team same with the Pistons lol.
The Celtics are good, respect to Boston; but not that good. Glad NY secured the win. 🏀💯
Wow hoping these will be thru and thru
That was AWESOME!!😀🔥✌️
Knicks in 🖐☝
What an exciting game!!! Hell of a comeback and mental toughness from NY. Brunson is a dawg and Anunoby is nice!!
Knicks to good for the Celtics
Celtics played down to their competition. It won’t happen again. Pint guard shoots 39% doesn’t get the ball to Kat.
OG trade from Raptors really benefited the Knicks. Just wish the Knicks would’ve traded for Boucher from Raptors at trade deadline could use another energy guy of the bench.
Bronson is str8 nasty 😂🔥🔥🔥
you just gave the wrong team confidence Boston smh 🤦‍♂️
The Melo era can’t match The Brunson era
Fake game Jaylen brown fouled on 3 point line called on the floor pure bs and right before that gets mauled driving. Ur somehow that weak ass oh anunoby dunk was a foul? Foh
The fact that Robinson was fouled repeatedly because he’s such a bad free throw shooter should give him pause, bro spend some time in the off season shooting free throws embarrassing. He’s just a liability for them.
Celtics in the 3rd took 20 shots...19 of those were 3 pt. attempts😮
These playoffs are sick!  No wonder the NBA playoff ratings are surging this season.  THIS is the basketball we've been waiting for!
I know Celtics fans are shaking mad rn 😂😂
OG went so crazy 🔥
Imagine Knicks vs pacers in the eastern conference finals? Wow
Cavs, Celtics and OKC losing their opening games in the semis on home court is bonkers and easily doubles the entertainment value
Brunson is mvp of the playoffs so far, and it's not even close.
I am not a fan of knicks, but damn, watching they play makes my blood burning. Wish Knick win the series…
15 of SIXTY from 3!!!
Credit to the knicks they played excellent. Some of the shots that Jrue and Tatum took down the stretch were nasty.
LMAO!  It's really great that Tatum was playing for the Knicks, he single handedly his own team.  Celtics are way overrated. Knicks in 4!
Hey Tatum, all aura jokes aside... THAT'S why no one thinks you can be the face of the league.
I really hate these coach interviews
John 3:16 ❤️🙏✝️🙏❤️😁!!!!!!!
THE (SIDE LINE REPORTER), NEED'S TO GO, TOTALLY USELESS. 🤔💯.
Celtics went 15-for-60 from three, missed 45 bombs. At this point, someone tell 'em the paint still exists! 😅

Lmaooooo bruh love when BOS loses like this
OG went HAM. So clutch overall great performance from the Knicks. KAT could do better.
I’ve never seen Jalen brown out roughed before in the last second
Finally they got the ball to OG. Wow just an awesome game.
Damnnn. Leading 20 on the 3rd and still lost. 🤦‍♂️
NY at 4 😂
literally america hates ny...
Jayson Tatum played so bad during that last stretch putting up ridiculous three point attempts
I hope Knicks will win Championship this year
PALDO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SINO PUMALDO JAN TAAS NG ODDS HAHAHAHAHA
I WAS TELLING PEOPLE THE KNICKS  ARE DANGEROUS DOWN BY 20 FORCED OVERTIME AND WON THE GAME
11:56 Am i trippin. Thats a gather shooting foul all day 😂
nah Jaylen sweet
Wolves fan here. Rooting for the Knicks in the East. Would be an unbelievable matchup if we both made it to the finals.
That's why Tatum is a bum
Dont panic Cs fans. We were banged up, couldn’t shoot, and were over our heads. We will lock in, shoot better, and hopefully get healthier. I still got Celtics in 5.
Tatum will never be great lol
KP statline is a nightmare
Keep writing us off, we right here
Newyork Knicks game ! Let’s goooooo 🔥 🔥 🔥
This is why the Celtics won’t win consecutive chips with Tatum & brown together neither one is knowingly the clutch closer on the team & that last play to end the game showed that
Damn Boston, Cavilers, and OKC all lost first game
Swerte pa nga bos di pumasok tira ni brunson wla sana ot
Wow New York Knicks they win despite leaving behind as many as 20 points as well they're in Boston... This gonna be a superb to watch
Ahaha celtics soft as shit
Yeaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!
Bruh all the road teams lost!
The knicks have the right personnel to match the celtics. Now it's just a matter of execution.  Bout to be a wild one defensively
Wow, nothing else to say
There is nothing special about Tatum besides his height ar his position 😂
Imma keep saying Tatum is overrated AF he got 2 moves and height drafted to a team already contending he's not that good
Did anybody see porzingis tonight , guy was a total non factor all night 😂🤷🏿‍♂️
Tatum is cheeks same 2 moves bro been overrated
humbled
OG is such a valuable player to have in your team. Does a little bit of everything and when he’s hot he’s 🔥
10:43 I can just imagine OG accidentally letting go of the rim and taking a scary fall with how much he was rocking the rim😧
8:29-8:30
I hate these highlights it’s just make after make so if they have the ball yk they going to score . I like highlights that show misses and defensive possessions as well
No idea why JT so obsessed with 3s.. don't think he will ever get MVP with plays like these... So soft
Celts still gonna win the series..They always slip up for 1 game..Book mark it
I’m just happy the Celtics don’t have an easy road to the chip this year. Last year was wild with how many all stars were out due to injuries during the playoffs.
OG WENT NUTS
Its not even basketball anymore. Just a skills competition on what player can make the most 3s smh
spike should be proud
15 years n pla nung last n naglaban to sa playoff
No one calls a game like Kevin Harlan.
Up 18 w 5 minutes left in the 3rd and give it away because all they know how to do is play streetball and throw up 3s the entire time. Ego kills.
In the 2nd quarter, the C's went 12 for 14 in the paint, 1 for 9 from the arc, took 14 free throws, and went into halftime with a 16 pt lead, where, for some reason, they decided 'alright, enough of that, let's let them off the mat, let's get out there and shoot a historic number of threes, and watch our lead get eaten away by easy transition baskets.'   They went 7 for 18 from the arc, 1 for 1 from the paint, and attempted no FT's in the third.   In the fourth, they went 3 for 4 in the paint, 2 for 15 from the arc, missed a pair of midrange shots, and took 6 FT's. They STILL could have won, bc the Knicks are terrible.  This is the darkside of Mazzulla ball - they really, truly believe that how they feel about outcomes in the moment - this game, the last shot, the last ten shots - should not have an impact on decision making. If the three is there, take the three. The math will out, no matter how many shots you miss, your average is your average, and you will hit it. It takes a LOT of work to get players to believe that and execute it - and there's a lot to argue that over a long enough span of games, it's correct - but then you get games like this. Playoff games. Easily winnable playoff games. Where the philosophy, or more exactly, the orthodoxy, shoots you out of contention.   And, while I cant be sure, I think Thibs said 'let them take them, they are ice cold' - bc how often does Tatum see this many open looks? The Knicks could not defend the paint and the perimeter, so they just...let the C's shoot, and the C's went ahead and lost the game. It was mesmerizing to watch. I am so glad I dont pay for playoff tickets.
TATUM shooting 3 while game is tied hahahaha.
bro OG went off tdy
*Knicks 🔥🔥🔥 **#MellDuney616** 🔥🔥🔥 -  MELL DUNEY 616*
tatum shooting step back 3s every time was horrible celtics deserved to lose
Great team win!  Loved it.
Big TEAM win. Enjoy tomorrow..and get ready for another heart attack Wednesday..
Celtic fans at 3rd Q: 😂😂😂 Celtics fans at 4th: 😐😑😑😓🥲
The Knicks vs a 1-Trick Pony. 60 Three’s attempted 😴😴😴 get ready for 300 more Celtic 3’s
Good lord. Steph Curry ruined basketball. The Celtics bricked FORTY-FIVE threes. That’s insane lol
Celtics 🐽🐽🐽🐽🐽
If Denver and Boston lose, Golden State is winning.
anunoby is that dog you want beside a josh hart and a kat and bridges! jalen is jalen hes a dog regardless but anunoby is so valuable the way he strengthens teams....
Three team with there homecourt lose.Cavs lose Pacers, Boston lose to Knicks, And then Okc lose to Nuggets😅
ill never understand why they dont give porzingis minutes. best center in the league
New York Knicks is a lethal contender !!!!!
I had Boston winning game 1 but after tonight’s game I can’t be upset, hell of a game played
LETS GO KNICKERBOCKERS!!!!!!!!! 💙🧡💙🧡
These playoff game 1's outta pocket 😅...no lent
Y’all not seeing Tatum?? Mf is TUFFF might make it back to the finals😮‍💨
10:02 Jason Tatum what are you doing ?!!!
Ppl hyped cuz Celtics lost in OT by 3 haaa yall have to play them 6more times n when they get hot hot Celtics win by 30points so let’s see how the next games are before getting to hype
I am Celtics Fan and this was a teachable moment for us.  New York is a tough team but there is no excuse for this loss!  Up by 20??? I have been saying consistently,  we play too much! Instead of being up and allowing the starters to rest.. Our coach keeps the starters in and they start playing soft and just blindly throwing up 3’s.. allowing the other team to get back into the game, as well as not transitioning into another defensive scheme to keep the other team on their toes..Our saving grace is coach Tom T does the same exact thing and they would have to play flawless  basketball the rest of the series in order to truly have a chance OR we have to keep constantly doing the same thing we did last night in order to allow them to win . Either way it’s a mess. The true definition of insanity! 😂
I hope NY enjoys the 1 win they’ll get this series.
Straight took the game literally
That's just ridiculous. Celtics had that in the bag. Not to mention Brown got fouled on that last play shooting the three-pointer but instead they had side out. Should have got three shots. Oh wow! Guess they'll have to beat them at the Garden for revenge!
Anyone who said C's in four Don't know ball
This has been a great playoffs so far, way better than last years
The Celtics have met their match
JALEN BRUSON PLAYING OUTTA HIS MIND WTF 👽
Lagot na Celtics court nyo pa naman
all that muscles and no grip
if there's gray area on whether it was in the process of shooting, I say don't advantage a team fouling intentionally. Got to stop rewarding intentional fouling as a strategy.
everyone thinks the favorites in the games(aka 1-2 seeds) are gonna easily win. these lower seeds putting bta on these so called nba title favorites
Jaylen Brown, Chris Brown, James Brown, Knickerbockers in 5
this Knicks team is nothing without Brunson he saved the Knicks lets all be real
Comeback win from 20pt deficit, on the road and  OT against the  defending champs. This Knicks team is good.
tatum reminds me of lebron, fades away in pressure moments.
This series is going to be insane
Brunson and Anunoby crunch time. Bridges with clutch steals.
How wasn't that last shot by Brown not a shooting foul though?!?
15/60 from 3 point by Boston
That's the spirit! Even with a significant 20-point gap, giving up isn't the answer.
Brown 😂😂😂 Katanga mo MVP ka ba
too soft on the last play
Wow unreal Boston
Let's go Knicks!
Celtic win in game 5
Boston, I don’t see the defense after half time
Imagine a Knicks v Wolves Finals
We outssiiiiidddeeeeeee
Okc AND Boston losing tonight was definitely a draftkings inside job, they made millions tonight
Let's go knicks 😎 💪 🗽 🧡 💙 🔥
For a while there I was questioning Brunson.  Seemed like everyone wanted to match up with him and they were just teeing off on him, scoring at will. But he pulled it together.  Great game.  Great team effort all around.
Brunson is the truth
Upset coming let's go knicks
racism lost today 🙏
OG was all gas no breaks!!! Mans went off!! What a game!!
My one critique of JT is he's always trying to get to that step back no matter what advantage he has. I get he shoots it at a high clip but put pressure on the defense even if you pass the ball. He bailed big fella out when he had him on an island. He had a defender to his left and right ball watching. He picked the shot the Knicks wanted. This is why people call him soft.
the NBA is so much more fun without Lebron
Enjoy the win. Celtics in 5.
Go Knicks ❤
Too much 3s boring no physical play
DERRICK WHITE SHOULDVE GOTTEN THE LAST SHOT.
Knicks in 6 baby!
Towns play too soft. He should be killin in the paint.
Bridge
15/60 from 3!? That's wild.
Jalen Brunson gives me goosebumps bro. So clutch.
Tatum ain’t the best in the east, still giannis
OKC vs Denver is even crazier with OKC securing a huge lead in the first half but got reversed by Nuggets to take the win.
Tatum is so overrated
Was that 20pts chasedown?
Brown left the group
Everything is upset in nba playoffs
Boston in 5. Nice game!
No championship train is ending up in Boston as long as it has to pass through New York
Okay they've made me a believer. Let's go Knicks.
Once Brunson got locked in I called game!! Once they started distributing him the ball I knew it was GG’s Brunson is a machine rn!! 💪🦾
I like the knicks win for the boroughs
Just here Collecting green tears & excuses...
Go Knicks!!
Tatum shoots too much 3. 😅 He cost them that game. He's big and athletic. Take your ass in the paint
this is new york nicks bro
Tatum chambalero
New York knicks just beat Boston at home wow….Ok so NYK should be able to beat the Boston 3 more times now they have home advantage. If I am the knicks this win should make me even more braver. Next game I’d shoot more threes and just everything. Once you beat the boogeyman you now are the boogeyman
Green-blooded choker HAHAHAHAHAHA
10:53 Mikal Bridges pulled an early celebration. And what happens next? Mikal will never learn in entire East Semis this NBA Playoffs, that Night Night Celly too soon will likely to be disastrous on Mikal himself
2:39 great play protecting the basket!
Celtics in 5
What a game! 🔥🔥
Wow...don't get me wrong, I love that the knicks won...but did we just watch a 3pt contest?   The closing minutes and hustle plays were awesome, but I don't know if I want to sit through another game of brickmania..miss after miss,after miss..like hello, do people not have a 2pt bag anymore? Is this what the NBA is now...dribble dribble, fade away from 27ft (with a defender all over him) and whoever makes more moon shots wins? There were enough bricks in this game to build a couple of high rises
28.1 left is it really a timeout!!that oughta be a 👍👍🏾
Boston missed an NBA record 45 threes and the knicks barely won. Ponder upon this. Boston is such a good NBA team. 100% chance Knicks lose the next one and I'm a Knicks fan, but buck foston
I don’t think we really appreciate how well conditioned Mikal Bridges truly is 😮
Crazy game ! this is what im talking about !
That's why NBA is special leauge
This is going 7 games. I'd be shocked and disappointed if this series didn't.
Pitchfork, hand torch, fat pork.. New York at 5
Don't trust JT to closeout game😅
Watching these highlights and I’m saying to myself wow basketball is dead. This isn’t basketball. It’s garbage
Jesus Christ ❤
C’mon Celtics let’s play physical with these guys. Use their coach system against them. And exhausted them out then finish them off with our rotation. Come on mane
There's only one Garden 😏🧡💙
Celtics always favored by the refs
Let's Go Knicks 👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
any surprised Celtics fans here, i hope not, because the Knicks just shocked ya, they shocked the nba, they shocked world. Brunson MVP. Team effort. Let's Go KNICKS! Knicks in 6! YEAH!!!!!!
BOSTON the CITY of drug addiction and homelessness region. hahaha
3:55. Straight out of NBA 2K
Dang what Boston  was up by 20 in the 3rd I Cut it off
The Celtics blew this game and the knicks took advantage
Brunson and Anunoby! BIG SHOT!!!
Good ass game damn Im mad I missed it GO KNICKS!!!!!!!
as a celtics fan I was absolutely shocked by the terrible performance late 3rd into 4th quarter. They were up by TWENTY. Gave up defensive rebounds and went for stupid contested three's when you didn't need to. 45 missed threes I believe it was. Got a chance in OT and blew it the same way. Gotta give props to brunson and towns though they really shined throughout the game. I am certainly not hoping for more of this in game 2
Jalen brunsen is nasty
What a game 🔥🔥🔥🔥 towns didn't join the party and yet the Knicks won.....better defense has to be played by the Knicks in upcoming games to continue winning
Big lost to Celtics Para sila di champion team,20 points deficit di na sustain ,dapat inalagaan nila kalamangan nila,,wla eh  NERVES ang umiral sa player!!!! Try nio sa game 2 sana malaman nio pagkakamali nio,THANKS NBA
thats what happens when you play with your food.
Game 5 only
Lucky game still boston
I know every player carries the ball, but Brunson has to be the most egregious. He might as well stop dribbling and just walk around with the ball. The refs wouldn’t call it because he plays for the Knicks.
puro tatum bolla 😂😂
knicks they have a spirit of champion and they are the new lakers
Brunson chews on pacifiers for fun get better Celtics. Big L.
I cannot believe my eyes. Stephen A is gonna be so funny tomorrow
It just means something to Knicks fans. "Iron Man" Bridges and Captain Clutch deserve all the flowers tonight
WHAT A GAME
Nice win New York!
What happened with the center? Kp had 0 points is crazy n only played 13 minutes is the Real reason they lost!
Celtics living and dying by the three..this will haunt them..celtics in 5..
The 3 chuckers did win tonight🗣️🗣️
Tatum still irrelevant, also cost them the game with the bad pass.
why tf is some many nba comments on this??
Derrick White the best pick in the last ten years
Down go the cocky and overrated Celtics lmao blew a 20 point home lead. The Celtics are done 😂 🗽 #KnicksTape
45 missed threes is trash hoops.
HELL YEAH NEW YORK
Julion Bronson thee GOAT
The good guys won
OG1 kinoby, mr. Chipotle, downtowns, pure hart, and mr clutch....wow what a combination....they winning this series for sure
KNICKS!!!
That's a gigantic choke by the Celtics 😂
celtics bottled that game. loool
That was some good basketball
Fluke win. Celtics will settle the score real quick. You best believe.
Just think Mavericks had Brunson, Luka, and Irving in their starting 5 a few years ago. Worst team management of all time .
That energy is crazy OG went beastmode
Most intense game of the series so far
WTHaliburton
Brunson's a big-time leader. When his team needs him to make a shot, he delivers. OG was awesome tonight. He shot well, especially from three.. Bridges, Hart, and KAT all contributed. The Cees attempted 60 three-pointers, which is crazy. Great Knicks win!!
The hustle ofnew york tem is real
Both GM's in the KAT/Randle trade bout to get a raise.
What did the Knicks just do !?😮
KAT needs to GO man he’s terrible wtf
That was a GOOD GAME!... dam!..... I'm salty I'm missing em!... 💯
That was all GRIT
I love the Knicks. I like Tatum too. These playoffs have been amazing....
Really . Shoot threes like its a layup but missed most?? Celtics is a very boring team
whoop them green butts
Jalen Brunson jumper is BUTTER😂
This was an aberration  I still have Celtics in 6  Celtics (4) (2) Knicks
Mikal Bridges is better than you think
NYK played extremely hard, and they showed the guts. Nice win! Celtics were lucky to get into OT.
Brunson is him
U thunk Boston missed 50 3s . They are so overrated. Don't be surprised if they are  swept.  Discusting second half
Josh Hart is only 6'2  but he can rebound and hussle play
bridges defense on last secs
Mikal with the clutch steal to seal the game!
Ayo let’s go NY!
Dralithon was right again holy shit this guy must be a psychic or something. I just made $10000 on fanduel
Upset and dethrone should be real this year, the Knicks are really good in the clutch. Hope they can continue like this for the remaining series and send the defending champs home for good.
OG IS ICE COLD
Jaylen brown , Charlie brown, buster brown . Knicks in 🖐.
NBA!! I really don’t want to see the little interviews in these recaps. If I wanted to watch those I’m sure I could go seek them out on their own. Just show me the action please 🤙
Nobody whom has been watching basketball is suprised they took Game 1. As we know that NY can actual play up to & get a win against Boston. Not saying this is any indication of the seriea, but I'm glad Boston & Cleveland both lost Game 1. Too much arrogance and cockiness coming out of those fanbases.
Brunson need dat automatic layup package like Tony Parker / Chris Paul had. If he can get those easy floaters to fall consistently he the best pg in the league
Dog!!!!
Looks like New York got this series in the bag New York in five
Knicks pacers ECF.  It’s on
Jayson Tatum needs to stop playing the perimeter and play inside more.
BUT THE REGULAR SEASON THOOOOO   THE REGULAR SEASON MEANS EVERYTHING!  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
LOL Buck Foston
Lots of three point shooting tonight. In the end, it’s “go New York, go New York Go!”
Bridges got caught doing the "night night". He tried to play it off lol
Wow. That was crazy bananas.  Clutch Player of the year misses point blank layup to end regulation but Knicks win Game 1 anyway in OT.
Woww great game that was very satisfying to watch knicks balled out for sure I hope they can bring this series home they clearly have the potential just have to keep up the intensity 💯
Last 15 sec OT and look how casual the C's behind in points 😂
Beautiful Play❤
JT on the last possession of 4th quarter was a dumb move. Why shoot 3's. He could've driven to the basket and draw fouls
I like that win Knicks, you gonna have to bring that every game this series. I'm pretty sure that Celtics gonna make their adjustments.

Yo am i trippin or does this announcer keep saying the wrong names ..
Celtics needed Pritchard out there late.
That’s an awesome comeback.
One of the most boring overtime playoff games ever. They need to get rid of the three point line
I never thought I would see the Knicks win again. Not with James Dolan and his Damage Plan
Nice spinoff and even better pass @1:07
Boston hero balls don’t work 😅
Came back from 20 down against the 'tics is crazy hard work. This championship might not even be Boston's, cleveland's or okc's. Lots of surprises
Kristaps "Bronchitis" Porzingis.... He better not be coughing on the Knicks!
Ticker Tape Parade Ny let’s go!!!
This is what I expect the nba to be like UNEXPECTED, seems like most series are scripted but it’s much more rich when unprecedented things happen. Why does the NBA think scripting leads to/equates to more revenue and traffic for the organization when in fact we just want to see the best actually go at it and see what happens
Joe Mazzula running into the ref🤣🤣
Came back from 20 down to win. Great game Knicks
Brunson wuz cookin fr🔥
Knicks in 7
🧡💙
Can a anyone make a shot and not do some bragging like they never made a shot b4.
great win but thibs gotta fix these goddam rotations man
that was a heck of a comeback, props to the NY knicks. looking like a 6 game series at min.
Winner is champs
Okay Knicks we see you. Now it's time to show that this run isn't a fluke and finish off this series
NY tough 🏀
Mikal played 51 mins and still took Jaylen Brown's lunch money in overtime
3:54 bro wtf
As a Cavs fan this kinda made me feel not so bad about our loss.
That video of Brunson dad making him to the step back after a cross over to the point he could barely walk. Tha product of that is what we seeing
Celtics clock management was terrible OG and Brunson was on  🔥 This will be a series for the ages
Did he say that was a Jalen Brunson? 4:49
3:05 why thibs suddenly turn British 😂
If Porzingis has bronchitis, why is he even playing when bronchitis is contagious? We don't need him coughing on the Knicks players.
That was a classic.
THANK YOU KNICKS!!!  LAKERS FAN.
THIS CLOW ALWAYS ON MY FKN ADS, PETE, GTFOOOO IM JUST TRYING WATCH THE FKN GAME
"Captain Clutch" Jalen Brunson strike again your the heart and brain of the New York Knicks go!go!go! Knicks!!!!!
This was a great game Brunson is a flamethrower
Boston is delusional.... not knicks fan.... NY in 6. #achiuwafan #precious
Tommy Buttcock needs to step it up in game 2
Incredible defensive stop at the end of OT
What have I just witnessed 😅😮😮
Great win but do not celebrate too long, Knicks have to make a contingency for the adjustments Boston will make Game 2.  Knicks need to play with more urgency and we need the heroics from OG and Mikal every game this series to stand a chance.  Let's take game 2 and put Boston in a 0-2 hole!  Go Knicks!
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE OR HEAR ...STEPHEN A SMITH  . BLUE SKY.. BABY   GO KNICKS GO KNICKS GO .
Tatum is ass idgaf argue with me
‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️ Kitty 😺 Towns... Pennywise Da 🤡... 🧢 & gown... Celtics in 5 ✌🏾😎 ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
Talk shit now Celtics fans 😂😂😂😂😂
NBA knows how much a Knicks Finals would sell
Great game!
Just relying on 3'$ everytime they had 50 attemp per game😅😅😅
boston is cooked
Literally all 3s. Yawn
Big Body Brunson bring ya ass to the garden, my god
celtics wahahaha
4:52 jalen brunson??
Knicks not up with the Celtics yet. 1st year together. Give ti time.
The lesson from this game is, don't always force to take 3s. Celtics, you are strong if you attack the basket. sure, your team has a good 3-point shot, but if it doesn't work, don't force it. it seems like the same thing happened in the finals against the Warriors.
Knicks Win 108-105
Let’s go Knicks !
MAYBE WE CAN GET A GAME SEVEN HERE
only win coz Porzingis left the game.. with Porzingis, Knicks wouldnt stand a chance
Og anunoby 🎉
I guess its time for Jaylen Brown to take over again ..Jayson Tatum is unreliable come playoff time..
IDK HOW THIS HAPPENED but FINALLY! LET THE BOYS PLAY!!
Boston was leading 20 points at the middle of 3rd. Forcing 3pts cost them the game.  JT : 4-15 Brown: 1-10 White: 5-16
🎶They say this is a Big KNICKS Towwwn🎶 🎶I just come from the Poorest Part🎶
We got it next Game 🇭🇹🤳🏾👏🏾
Wow what a fantastic competition
OG is a Jedi and Bronson is a low down disgusting nasty dirty dog.
Overtime
Sure wish the Mavs still had Brunson. He is a gamer!
Celtics deserved that L. that’s why i dont like the idea of thinking the knicks are just a walk in the park. 🥱
Crazy OG FROM TORONTO TO NEW YORK
Brunson looks like a mixed male version of the girl from - the last of us
What a whale of a basketball game. Big. Body. Brunson. Incredible shot making by both teams.
Blew a 20 point lead in game 1
BOS wins this sries still.
INCREDIBLE GAME
What a Great Game! Better than Lechoke's team
Daaang!! Can't wait to see what Cam and Ma$e have to say in the morning
if Knicks win against Celtics and Pacers win against Cavs, its Warriors champs babyyyyyy EZ
A big "F.U." to ESPN Desportes for spoiling the game.
THUS WAS A COLD MF HERE! WHO ELSE GOT GOOSEBUMPS ON THAT KNICKS RUN! PLAYOFFS BABY
Bro, you’re right this coach really is a menace Tatum got hit against the rim and you’re telling him to get up that shit probably seriously hurt
So porzingis had Zero points Aint no way smh 🤦‍♂️ WTH !! Lol 😂
From 55-75 to 89-89, what a masterclass in coming back up from behind
This is look like  home game for ny
anunoby is on fire man
Celtics in six, folks.Big Jew father Silver handed me the script.
Put some 'Speck on OG's name!!!
go NYK
boston plays like a bunch of cocky children. GET HUMBLED
Celtics are like that one guy that always shoots 3s on 2k
If the Knicks win this series remember this defensive play by Bridges is just beautiful...
Giving up 20 point lead is crazyyy.
Jalen us Clutch ❤❤❤❤
leagues in a good place when the knicks are good
tatum in clutch 🙅🤦
wowsers..
Pacers vs Knicks next round?
I know I’m not the only one that seen Karl tap the ref making him call the personal foul knowing it was a shooting foul to tie the game
Boston is trash. How many leads have the blown this season?
Why tf they include like 90 seconds of pregame this is supposed to be a highlight video
NY played gritty but unfortunately I don’t think they can match Boston defensively or shooting the 3 ball over a 7 game series
Now Boston winning 3 straight
Shaq isn't the fool it's you Chuck
The man of the   fourth quarter jalen brunson 🔥🔥🔥🔥
If the Knicks play like this we will be anyone!  🧡💙
That behind the back cross over @ 8:54 by Brunson was NASTY
tatum overrated
Warriors wanna be lol. Celtics good at bricking 3 pointers😂
It's very tasteful to see Boston lose game 1 at home. I'm happy for you delusional Celtics fans 😂
I hope both teams had fun
Get 'em, Knicks!  From a Pistons fan.
OG is incredible. Move some parts around but not him. HES A DAWG DOING DAMAGE
at some point it became a mental game. it just happens the ny comes out on top.
LMAO! BROWN relying on the ref to call the foul jajajajaja
Come on, Tatum! You gotta close it out!
Can Knicks do it again 3 more times?  Will Boston do this again 3 more times? No to both.
Knicks beat my Pistons but, I hope they beat those damn Celtics 😂 New champions like Kansas city 😝
And this is why the Knicks did all that to get Bridges and OG lol
What a game. 🎉
I don't think I've ever seen so many 3's taken in my life.
What a game everyone banging 3s
Hahahaha BOSTON wahahahahajajajaja 🫵🫵🫵Knicks 💪💪💪😝😝😝😝😛😛😛😛🤪🤪🤪
Mikal defensive was great near the end of the game. But if you play 50 minutes you have to give me more than 8 points. Towns 14 points is not enough.  And Brunson is going to wear down if he gets no help. Thank God for OG helping tonight. Tibbs running these guys in the ground. I'm not a Boston fan but noway will they beat Boston 3 more games like they pulled this out tonight.
Brunson is my favorite player and I hate the knicks I’m from Philadelphia he’s a dog man
A Celtics loss is a win for America.
9:07  BACK TO BACK!!!!!!!!!!!! BACK TO BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCKKKKKKKK
Cinema
Nice game Knicks🔥
The New York Knicks are gonna be a problem!!!!!!
45 missed 3’s is the exact reason that’s why! 😂 crazy game 1
I actually liked the way the knicks played I know getting tired of boston beating on them like the warriors be doing the rockets 😂😅 brunson turnt into 2015 steph
This will be the best series in the playoffs for sure. I got Celtics in 7 though by 1 or 2 points.
what get em out here
Go knicksssssss🎉🎉🎉
Watching Jalen Brunson cook the way he did. No wonder IT keeps trying to come back to the League
Brunson 🔥🔥🔥
Knicks showed one thing with this game: They are not going away quietly.  Feels like they had a mission to prove with the national media wrong with this game. They showed that this is a series.
6:15 slash n dash 6:32 8:55 💪😡😡! 9:05 want some more!
I been saying this since February and I think we all got to see it tonight, The Knicks have got A SQUAD, and ever since Bridges and Towns Showed Up in NYC, I knew that the Knicks were guna be a Player for the 2025 Chip. I know Brunson was hurt for a small stretch at the the end of the season but in my opinion he is Hands Down the 2025 NBA MVP. Bold Prediction Here: “ The Eastern Conference Finals will be The Indiana Pacers vs The New York Knickerbockers…. Letz Freeekin Goooo Baby, can’t wait for Tyrese Haliburton versus Jalen Brunson.
What a game!
Mikal bridges is Iron Man for real.
celtics choked by 20 pt lead
Knicks 🔥
WOW gottem! lol YOINK
It's crazy to think that jalen and luka were both teammates at one point and time. Nobody knew jalen was gonna be this damn good 🔥
That was a good game
Both top seeds celtics and cavs just defeated from knicks and pacers  Lmao😅😅😂😂
If there are no more jason tatum haters, I am dead.
Now the Knicks will lose 3 in a row 😅
Brunson is him it's getting harder and harder to argue otherwise but his fellow starters and the bench players have shown up huge for the Knicks and Towns has played with great energy and fight even the games where he isn't scoring last year he would vanish in big moments when he wasn't putting up numbers now I feel like he plays hard as shit all the time with passion and he's always been talented
Playoffs OG,
Coach Thib got that Phil and Lil haircut from Rugrats 3:09
GO TO SHOW, AIN'T OVER TILL IT OVER, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE KNICKS BLOCKERS  IN THE HOUSE  LOVE ❤️ IT.
I was hoping the Knicks could steal 1 of these first 2 games .  HUGE win to put Hone court advantage on its head
No way in hell. TOM THIBEDEU NEEDS TO STOP PLAYING HIS PLAYERS ON UNREASONABLE MINUTES
I’ll take 1-1 going back to New York … few years back Boston lived by the three and died by it .. they looking like that again …
this playoffs is unpredictable
game 1 plang yan.. wag muna kayo magsaya
When i tell hou how enraged i was when i saw the score at 45-61...then 52-75 i was Raging but 😮‍💨😤💯🙏🏿🔵🟠🔵🟠
Gogo brunson
Puro lng kayo salita kpag bumili n kmi Wala nmn epekto fake
NEW YORK STAND UP
why are there midgame interviews?
8:30 It went through his players' legs for a step back corner 3 dam lol! That will lice forever in Knicks history!
Nyknicks is no joke💪
how does boston manage to choke games like this?
Go NY Go NY Go!!!!
LFG!! The Knicks saved their wins against the Celtics for the postseason! HELL YEAH
I'm a regular, When did OG become MJ 😂
What’s crazy is that both teams played horrible but who wanted it more the Knicks who fought the Knicks 15/60 from three is crazy I expect both teams to play a LOT better than tonight lgk we up 1-0
Brunson has championship pedigree in his dna he finds or wills his teams to wins but he gotta get the job done
JT be balling
New York is in the building 😂😂😂
Tatum shooting form so nasty man, shit aint even touching rim, him, Kobe, Jordan, Iverson, and Carmelo shooting form my personal favorite
I left the game when the Celtics were up like 15 points cause I figured I was wasting my time. Check the game recap an hour later to see we lost somehow 😭 tf happened
Knicks in 4
The Celtikkks fans won't like the players they were cooked by.
Thank you Basketball Gods
❤ where is your defense team Boston
I’m just happy Boston lost 🎉
lol
"ABSOLUTE CINEMA" 🗣🗣🗣
It’s only game 1 😂
Boston Smelltics
Rooting for a team you've hated your whole life because you think the other team is overrated and obnoxious is unnecessarily excruciating... so with that in mind, GO KNICKS !!!
Screw the Celtics lfgo. Where are y’all Tatum glazers at huh???
Jalen brunson is unstoppable🔥
Go New York- go New York- go New York- GO!!!
Are you fucken kidding me ... Wow .. How do you lose an 11 point lead.... Celtics need to wake the hell up. That was sooo weak . And at your own homecourt...
Crazy to not call a timeout here 11:39  You've got 2 of them... they dont stack for the next game😂
JB OF NYC.!!!!
This will be an amazing series!
Brunson and the knicks are serious so
Y did Tatum shoot a 3 when it's 100 to 100 ..........man that was stupid 😮
1:05 Did Poooorzingas bad
WOW!
What a Comeback
NY KNICKS :)
I love this Game 1 Drama but Boston will figure it out on this series. They've been here before.
Bro when did Jaylen Brown get a buzz cut 😭
Brutal loss but Celtics did that to themselves for just chucking 3s and stopped being aggressive. Gotta give the Knicks their flowers for staying in it all the way, game 2 will definitely be a lot better especially from the Jays. Also a Cs fan, hoping this series goes to 6-7, a much needed series to happen in the last few years.
Just heard score from NY/BOS!! Not a NY fan, but a smile ran across my face because I ALWAYS root against the  Celtics! Go NY!
This game had everything! Wire to wire, OT and Kevin Harlan commentating. It’s going to be a sad day day in sports when he retires
Embarrassing
I’ve been watching the Knicks since I am 13 years old. Brooklyn Born 1942 I am now 83 and watching them for 70 freakin years! This is a fun team and I’ve seen decades of drought and some championships but I have to say Brunson Absolutely awesome so calm in the clutch overtime thanks TIBS for giving them staying pwr so obvious at the end didn’t need Oxygen! Still an along way to go.
It should be Knicks at 4
Battle of shooting
Remember all the ones who said the knicks didn't stand a chance and how they didn't have that championship pedigree knicks in 🖐
Good game to both sides.
10:41 that was just a nasty dunk
As a NY sports fan I was expecting Boston to sweep but the fact that the Knicks got a win is impressive as hell! Even if they go out 4-1 i’m happy lol
Knix N Six
NYK stand up !!!!
Who said the NBA was dead? Did I just see what I just saw? If that's what we get for a game one, this series is going to be off the charts. Who said the NBA was dead? 😅
Brunson and Anunoby have pure Knick energy.
People going to praise Brunson but Mikal won the game for us in overtime !
GO KNICKS GO  LOVE IT. DON'T STOP NOW.
Yoooooo!!!!!!! The fuq these talking bout this game ain't gonna be close!?!? These teams are gritty and tough!splitting images of each other.
Comeback 😂
This team is like the leagues unknown stars all put together. Real hardball about to be played here folks
Man Jalen Brunson a BUCKET!
I don’t know if it’s cause it’s Boston but I never hear anyone talk about them outside of people from Boston I never seen a team so good but under the table since the spurs
BROWN WHAT HAPPENED 😂 YOUR CANDY WAS TAKEN AWAY IN TO YOUR HAND
Let’s gooooooo knicks
Mavs fan here, miss Brunson, miss Luka 😥
Yes sir
Jaylen Brown’s old head pump fake 😂😂😂
Scripted.
196K 54min 23M subs
Great game. I thought Brown earned a shooting foul at the end though. He timed it right.
OG!!!!!!!!!!!
These Ma$sh0les thought they had the dub early. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
BIG  CAT, WE NEED YOU ON THE COURT, NOT ON THE BENCH, STAY THE HECK OUT OF FOUL TROUBLE, NOT HELPING THE TEAM, SITTING ON YOUR BEHIND,     WE GOING NEED YOU.
Nah Jaylen that aint it. You gotta get your weight up no way he let him steal the ball from him like that
OG is a machine dont matter if its OT he will dunk the ball in your face if u give him space. congrats to my knicks peaking at the right time.
chokers
my boy bridges ripped that shit LOL
Unbelievable loss
hahahahahaha
L😊
Poor defense by the Celtics and they played NY cheap
. GO KNICKS,Go knicks 💪 . Vamos knickerbokers
2:17 hah he tripped
3pt fest
Ahhhhhhh look at my team !!!!! LETS GO !!!!!
bruhh i thought boston was gonna win today..
Knicks vs thunder to the finals
Omg new York beat Boston what a great game
Yes!
Celtics got jinx by their fans 😅 this upcoming game 2 is a must win for boston. good luck..
Mavericks fan here (fandom hanging by a thread) supporting the knicks. The celtics took 60 3-pointers? Sheesh. Doesnt sound very fun to watch
Wow New York Knicks is in the zone.... Good Job Knicks let's go! 🏀
4:52 from who??? lmao
Tatum is 34% three point shooter and Brown is a 32% three point shooter. They think that they are Steph Curry. Haha. Brunson, OG and KAT are like averaging 40% three point shooters. Do you want to play this type of game?
0:45 "the ability to knock down 3s" that's some hella caster curse LOL
Tatum gotta stop shooting them egotistical 3’s like bro pass the ball u not clutch like da
Two teams I love seeing lose, Lakers and Celtics!!! Let’s go.
This is NBA PLAYOFFS 🏀 at it's finest.
Playoffs been great this year man! Don’t bet on games, makes it even better!
Nice play by Knicks at 8:35
Love when the knicks are good
wow proud of my team pulling it off
"We built for this sh*t"
So called Nba experts  today: "The Knicks will get swept demoralized dont stand a chance and will be destroyed "  Nba so called experts tomrw morning  "I told you I told you the Knicks will win game 1"  SMH!!!
It takes the celtics to shoot 25% 3pt to lose in overtime by 3... yeah im not worried boston in 5 or 6
Celtics this game= Perfect example of TOO many threes….   They were up 25 points & settling for contested threes 5 seconds into the shot clock..    just BAD basketball…  But, Amazing game by Brunson/OG down the stretch 🔥
Dang ok a little respect for the Knicks now…to come back and win 🫡🌎🛫🛫
A big first win for the Knicks.  What a tough team.
Tatum should've taken the last shot.
Shows you what happens when you don't make the three ball! Also get too comfortable with a big lead and what the heck happened to Kristaps Porziņģis?
There go big Katt selling out again ___ now you see why Antman got em outta there ✈🛫🛬🛩✈✈😅😅
Knicks this season 🤔🤔🤔      👇👇👇⬇️⬇️⬇️  #1. Second round exit again  #2. Eastern Conference Finals  #3. Finals Appearance  #4. Get CHAMPIONSHIP this season
😨👊💪☝️
Took a total collapse to lose in ot I don’t think Celtics should worry about
If the Knicks don’t wind themselves out (as a Knicks fan this has a very high chance) like they did against Indy last year, they have a shot to win this series with how good of playoff performers they have.
Damn OG Anunoby was killin them boys
Was the game at Boston or MSG because that crowd had plenty of Knick fans lol
Hot take: Knicks should hire Mike Malone if Knicks didn't make a deep playoff run this year. KAT has always been a sneaky good passer. He averages very few assists but the assist he makes tend to generate very easy points. Mike Malone knows all the scheme Jokic and Denvor plays. Big man as a passing hub has been achieved by quite a few players, like Marc Gasol in raptor. KAT can be one of them. Mike Malone is also familiar with coaching a decent defense with a slow big man like Jokic and KAT. KAT is also very efficient but sometimes don't get many touches. Malone likely know how to get a big man more involved.
Mikal bridges and the Knicks snatch game one from the Celtics! Humanity will soon be restored.
Wow!!!
That was probably Knicks only win in this series. Celtics won't shoot that bad from 3 again. Would be great if they could push it to 7 games but I'll be stunned if they do
I fell asleep with all those 3pts attempts
You could hear the Knicks fans in the arena. Can’t imagine how it’ll sound at home if they take both games in Boston…
OG ANUNOBY
Love a good fight ;)👏
I never quite understand how this knicks team were so consistently bad against top team in the regular reason. On paper, the knicks should have high ceiling (or at least high variation) that can punch much higher than their average ability. This is because Brunson, KAT, OG, mikal all have the potential to score 30 points in any game. You would image there would be some nights where some of them just pop off so the knicks can upset a top team at any random time. This expectation somehow didn't happen at all in the regular season.
Celtics need to take more shots inside the paint.
As a lakers fan, F it im rooting for New York😂 their crazy ahh fan base could use a championship
When Tatum realizes he’s the second-third option Boston will be more efficient and close out games. They be letting Tatum do anything out there.
the celtics do not know how to hold on to a 20 point lead🙄
insane😮
O.G is moving like he's 2019 Kawhi
KIT-KAT, SCAT PACK, Knick Knacks.…… Knicks in 6
Knew the Knicks weren't just gonna let the Celtics run right over them. This is gonna be a banger series.
It's crazy reading Knicks fans saying this was the biggest playoff win...NYC delusions are here. Literally just game 1.
Epic come back 😂
if you not watching basketball now YOU BETTER IT'S ON
@7:50 IM A LEBRON FAN PERIOD but when I see players like this in the playoffs standing still watching the damn ball instead of moving constantly non stop pisses me off wth was Pritchard and Holliday doing idc where you are on the court you have to gravitate towards the rim when the other player shoots and get into a position to fight for the rebound!! It's common sense! Urgency! Just like LeBron dumb ass in game 4 ball watching n shit smh -.-
Tatum tells the celtics to yell "Kobi!" when taking 3s
Been a knicks fan over 20 years never been going that crazy in my living room before. WE HERE 🟠🔵🟠🔵
Everyone played strong for New York tonight, KAT had a slow start but finished strong! JB being clutch yet again
Celtics with Porzingus : 😀 Celtics without Porzingus: ☹
This is it for celtics. They rely so much on 3's. No inside scoring.
Celtics being Lazy like Lakers in play offs
Tatum lost this game taking terrible shots
Playoffs Brunson is DIFFERENT!!!
Let's Go Knicks!!!
Whoa!! Good game. Go New York!!
Bridges said “gimme this shii” 😂 This is the celtic team I know lmao Soft af
👀👀
Let’s Go Knicks
Celtics should be ashamed of themselves, pathetic performance!
Ahhh yes, The Celtics, we just LOVE when they take 10,000 3s,       ………..especially after they just missed 9,999 in a row 😊…
Celtics fan here. They DESERVED TO LOOSE. Horrible shooting skills especially early on. Way too many missed shots. Very disappointing appearance. They gave that game away
I dont know if I actually am cheering for the Knicks or I just dislike Celtics this much LOL
New york going to have a field day after this
One of the Classic Game of the decade! Wow wow wow! I kind of loving the NY Knicks spirit to win the game no matter what! ❤🏀
Tatum's three at the end of the game is why he will never be considered one of the greats. He should have driven the ball to the basket to put pressure on the defense. Stop jacking up threes!!!
bruson played hiss a$$ off
What a game
4:53 he called him Jalen Brunson 🤦‍♂️  White people smh
20 pts ????
Lets go bounce back at game 2 . Lets go celtics.
WWE. Lmao. People still can't see it. It's been embarrassingly obvious for a long time.
did not expect this
Wow what a game..
At least for one game, this took me way back to when the Knicks were a playoff powerhouse.
Knicks played some of their best basketball and Celtics played some of their worst basketball and it was still just a 3 point game 💀 congrats to the knicks though, they earned this one
Mitchell Robinson played 21 minutes and he had a whopping +13 in +/-. The hack a Mitchell didn't work too well in game 1.
This feels like the 90s NYK vs Boston 🎉 great game
Helluva game!! Knicks can really win this series! Game 2 is gonna be sooo important!! Cuz if Knicks can win it, no way they lose 4 out 5
Mikel stole that ball disrespectfully af
Ogugua Anunoby British legend!!!!
He cut her off something crazy @8:00 lol
“Weeeeee dDiiiIIId iiiittttTT” 🤡🤡
this is New York Knicks Basketball🗽🗽🗽
Boston is gonna get Miami'd again
Mikal Bridges crucial 2 steal and 1 block. What a great player
It's a rigged product as I'm rooting for Knicks to win,  Towns and Hart early foul trouble folks is always how the Synagogue works it lessen your aggressiveness in the 3rd and 4th quarters! Boston is not winning the Chip!!!❤
America wins when Boston loses ❤ worst fan base
inagawan ng kendi si jb ulaga
Bridge said I'll be taking that. What a win!
I didn't expect that knicks would win especially in game 1. I still have them winning the series
Why go for 3 if ur tied? Watta mindset of Gayson Tatum 😂
I thought the knicks might get game 1 - Brunson was great late 4th. knicks can take 2 games but i think that might be the best they can do.
OG the man
Choke na naman yan
Bad defense all night is why we lost that game! Don’t let horford get stuck on that island with Brunson! JT you gotta play better defense! Too many easy lay ups and not enough defensive rotation! It’s got nothing to do with living and dying by the three! Plus already screaming that on game ☝🏾 which New York escaped with! 😂😂😂 ohkayyy
The NYK literally snatched the win from the Celtics. 😅
I don't know which is worse the celtics missing 45 3s or the rockets missing 27 3s in a row
Did you know that Tatum was a 34% three point shooter during the regular season? Brown was a 32% three point shooter during the regular season. Sheesh.
Never thought Tyrone lue would play for Celtics.
Who the fck is the franchise player Ist it tatum So why pass the ball to brown
BOSTON WHO?🤡 HAHAHA 20 point lead blew up 🤢🤢🤮
choke job by Boston. What is their deal holding leads sometimes?
👂🏽👂🏽where tf are the meatballs who said sweep
nice dub by new  York
Refs vs Celtics , knicks refs in 5
Nothing like a good ol shooting fest. I still wanna see guys go to the hole. Now Thats basketball, this 3 point contest garbage is wack. Bring back real ballin
The Knicks are battle tested from the Detroit series 💪We played with many disadvantages foul trouble & questionable players but our guy got the job done collectively. Proud of my Team We Dem Boys💪
Steven a is gonna have a easy day
Mikal bridges keeps delivering, the man is crazy. btw can anyone explain how dralithon got the outcome right, feels something bad is up tbh...
HEY Nba we don't care about the interviews STOP showing them in the highlights good win from Knicks though.
Insane how the Knicks completed a 2p point comeback to win in overtime what a game!!
OG is OP
11:52 Mazulla stepped all the way across half court looking for that timeout lol
I think Boston should shoot More 3s.   Shoot 100 or more, a game. Maybe 200        to play it safe
Warriors (4) vs Pacers (2) Finals
OGeez!
kms
This result can't meets the CELTICS  fan's expectation, I am extremely upset with this failed.
How could you go 5/16 from 3 while not being a star player. Derrick white should start looking for options if he can't score a 3
Helluva win for NYK! 😤😤😤
Big win for New York Knicks against Bolton Celtics let’s make it 2-0 .
If the Knicks win Game 2, the series is over.
TATUM GIVE THE BALL TO THE  3RD AND 4TH 3PTS MADE IN REGULAR SEASON WHITE AND PRITCHARD AND GIVE THE BALL TO BROWN IN CLUTCH
Bruh bridges doing night night is funny asf
Celitcs missed 45 3's tonight. Thats just disgusting basketball.
What is wrong with the Boston Skeptics?
Still can't believe Dallas lost  Brunson and Luka.😂
Why psycho mazulla didnt do anything on this?where is your defense celtics? You are gonna be traded next season.
Good win go Knicks 💙
@1:08 🎿🛼🛼🛼
Gogogo new york🎉🎉🎉🎉😅
Disgusting performance from TATUM, too much dribbling step back side step garbage shots!! 🤦‍♂️😬🤦‍♂️
Who's the leader of the Celtics??
Not gonna lie celtics ain't been looking good to me, I'm just not seeing the hunger and intensity I was expecting come post season,  it simply ain't there...hope this loss is sobering
It's only one game and 60 wobbly Celt treys; but...."Let's Go To The Hop Now Knickies, Let's Go To The Hop!".
F*******>|>]>]>\ the knocks for this game. I am so disappointed in my Celtics for this slip up
Boston chokers 😂 wanna be Kobe!
People talking about Boston missing all them 3’s instead of giving credit to NY’s perimeter defense!
Kevin Harlan’s one of the greatest to ever do it.
This postseason has been fire. 🔥
Very intense game. That gave the green granpas a run on their money. Respect to knicks, this team came far to become a playoffs contender
It's A Reason Brunson Received More MVP Votes Last Season Than Tatum
whaat a game!
Usual Coach Thibbs playing like he only has 5-6 players.
Don't count out Knicks too early fr!
This knicks squad is nice!
Yessssssssssss❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I'd blame it all on Tatum for shooting bricks multiple times, he lived and die from behind the arc. When the scores are tie a mid-range shot is easier than forcing a 3 especially if you hit consecutive brick shots. And I noticed Brown was either lost or just fed up with Tatum.
TATUM the BALL HOG WANNABE KOBE just LOST this one for the Celtics!!
Im not a Boston person but that dude White does everything Right!💯
Knicks coming back is just wow.
Wow the Knicks won another game where they were thoroughly outplayed by a team that wasn't playing well.  I'm sure that'll hold up lol
GREAT GAME!!
These Are not The First Round KNICCS
Knicks in 7
Why jason tatum shoot 3's when the game is tie & the clock running out ?
Couldnt be happier for them. Love upsets.
F in the chat for OG and Brunson
Crazy steal just like stealing someones fried chicken 😂 nice game
Brunson is balling
No Team Is Ever Winning A Playoff Series Missing 45 3s
4:51 who
RIP my money
Let's Go Knicks!
The Crocs Jason tatum😂
Celtics have been exposed
LETS FN GOOOOOO NY GONY GO NY
Let's go knicks Knicks in 6
Boston chokers 😂
wow
Choker 😂😂😂
The Knicks came back from 20 points down to win!
I'm a Dubs fan but watching these two teams go at it is tuff on me!  I like these two teams and what they've been through in the past years.  Makes me wish they weren't facing each other.  I guess I'm just gonna enjoy it as a basketball fan but man, it's till tough!
Crazy game 1
I love this voice!
Tatum and brown aint no superstars😂
EVERYONE WHO DOUBTED THE KNICKS , KEEP THAT SAME FXCKING ENERGY.....
celtics are frauds
Thats a loud Knicks crowd LOL. LET"S GO KNICKS!
Having YOUR STARTED...LIE AND LEAVE...WHAT A ..BUMMER...🤐🕵
D. white 5-16 in trees😢
Bridges played much better than the numbers will say
Knick comeback or Celtic collapse?
That man Bridges is a straight dog 💯
I like how Brunson chose to guard JT that’s how it was in the 90s the best chose to guard the best that’s championship pedigree
nyahahaha 😂😂😂😂 kaumay na kayo boston
owwww shettttttttttyyyyyy letsgooooo
LEZGO NEWYORKKNICKS
Charles Barkley cursed them 😂
This new york knicks team is like shohuku team in anime searies with only 5 players played 😅
Mikal Bridges playing 51 mins is insane!! Thibs, don't change! HAHAHAA
Yes go go knicks
Like Melo’s Knicks vs Celtics Big three all over again
OG Anunoby brought the fire. Brunson was in the zone. Tatum needed his team to eat more IMOs Pizza to get Celtics over the top. 🗽 🍀 🏀
Boston Celtics, Austin Texas, Lost on Netflix?, Knicks in 5!
Tatum shooting bricks
Tingus Pingus 0 pts
Mikal’s endurance is insane.. 51 minutes is no joke in a NBA game
Wow.
People are so blinded they dont see we beat ourselves
Kat, we love you in mn and love what you’re doing.
THE KNICKS JUST CHANGED REALITY 💯💯💯💯💯💯! BELIEF IS EVERYTHING!!!
Go Knicks!!!!🎉🔥
I wanna see knicks vs thunder or gokden state in the finals man would be absolute cinema
This will be a good series home in New York and also Boston ngl
What is dralithon 😭
OG made the shots, bridges with the steals, towns with the tip ins, hart with the hustle and brunson with the clutch. Qe win 1 game bois it's not a clean sweep now.
Wheres The Celtics Center ??
Wow, Brunson crazyy
One of the best Knicks wins in franchise history. Brunson, OG and Bridges absolutely clutch in the end. What a comeback.
The 3-point contest approach really hurt the Celtics.
Ay that first play when Hart shook the soul outta Porzingis set the tone 😆🔥
Celtics still winning the series
💣wooooooowww
This was one good ass game straight shootout for real shout out to the Knicks they got it in
This has the potential to be one of the greatest playoff series of all time
Please bring back the mid range, post up, cut and drive to basketball. Too many three's taken is boring to watch especially when they are not going in. I can see why the viewership is slowly declining.
Great playoff game .
Pacer Knicks 🤷🏽
what a game for NY...
I see once again Tatum deferring last shot to Brown again, but yeah he's the Celtics leader 🤣😅😂😂
Jayson Tatum gotta be better than this.  He constantly jacks up 3’s. Take it to the damn basket.  The coaching is trash too!
Town is town to you Boston go to barrio 😂😂😂 tatum is crying to town
knicks in 7
Damn majority of the highlight is 3s...
Mikal “Debo” Bridges
dude if knicks win... insane legendary, but remember title is goal not beating celtics
I haven't seen playoffs like theses since watching the 90s/00s playoffs.
We beat ourselves up 20 and still shooting from deep. Greed is a killer but at the same time knicks barley got it done and we wasted alot of trips down the floor and we were sloppy with the ball. Celtics in 6
Man they out there playing rugby 🏉
I didn't think the Knicks were gonna steal Game 1 like that. Down by as many as 20 in the 3rd quarter and coming back to win in overtime. If the Knicks do happen to dethrone the defending champion Celtics in the conference semis, they might just make a run towards the NBA Finals. I'm not saying they will, but you don't know what might happen. I still have the Celtics winning in 6 games, though.
The celtics are frauds aint nobody taking them seriously 😂
Jayson Tatum drives me crazy with all the 3’s he jacks up. Take it to the damn basket!!!
🏀GREAT GAME! 🏀GOOO KNICKS!!!🏆...
Many fake celtic fans here. Do not ever join the bandwagon if they win if you cannot join them in the lost. Typical fake celtic fans all of a sudden joe mazulla sucks as a coach?
Boston choketics😂😂😂😂
Mikal Bridges punked the shit out of Jaylen Brown.
Jason Tatum scared to be clutch
Great game, I like OG for the Knicks and White for the Celtics as sleeper players. Knicks was solid in OT and Boston panicked at the end of OT
Choke
0:43 I don’t know why anyone is surprised Boston missed 45 3s. Reggie Miller literally told yall right before the game how Boston plays.
Jason Tatum is the only superstar that doesn’t get any stick for playing poorly
Number 1 & 2 west and east seed in these playoff means nothing😂...Just wait for OKC result
Wow
Keep chucking them 3’s Boston 🤣
Pacers and Knicks getting upset Game 1 wins on the road. Hope we get to see them face each other in the conference finals!
😮Great win NY!!! This won't be an easy series against the Celtics.
Hahaha
What a game! Lets gooo NY!
Another pathetic 3 shooting competition. This is not basketball.
boston choked lol
LETS GOOOOOO KNICKS BABY EVERYONE COUNTING US OUT I LOVE IT !
Jayson Tatum must be involved into something weird tonight, dralithon explains it all y`all just do not want to believe this league and games are not real !!!
THATS MY G MIKAL SEALING THE WIN YESSIR. WE MISS YOU IN THE VALLEY.
Scary thing for the knicks is OG is not playing like that again, they just don’t have a 2nd option you can trust consistently.
Detroit fan here... I feel better about losing 😅. At least the knicks aren't trash. Watch out Boston 👀
Onlyfans, look ma no hands, Shay Shay got scammed…knicks in 5
They didn't show the twenty 3 point shots that Tatum missed.  How many did they miss as a team? 45?
Whoever wins this series will be in the nba finals
We can't blame doc rivers this time
Knicks up 1-0! NO LEAD IS SAFE! DONT GET CONFIDENT KNICKS! WE NEED TO STAY LOCKED IN! Lets Go Knicks!!!
What a game🎉 lets go knicks!!
Celtics fans : Cavs are frauds also Celtics fans it’s just one game😡😂
Knicks is not easy to beat🔥
Great series, 2 NY teams. Meaning THERE IS NO HOME COURT as both team fans are there.
Knick fan wtf Boston jacking up 3's like crazy weren't even trying to get into the paint.  Shooting 25% beyond the arc, what they don't have an inside game? Playoffs different than regular season they weren't even faking drives, just standing and launching 3's.
celtics the new rockets
WHAT A WIN! GOGOGO KNICKS !
What a game and what a comeback by the Knicks!.... Unfortunately, this will probably be the only game they will win... Hopefully i'm wrong so we can keep on watching this series
If New York wins this their fans are going to be so annoying for the next decade
KP looked like he was moving okay I wonder what was wrong with him
What a disgrace the Celtics are. So annoying.
The basketball gods really didn’t want Brunson to make that floater at the end😂
Knicks HAVE TO BE BETTER AT THE FREE THROW LINE. Also, at least for tonight, Bridges made some game winning plays including the steal at the end.
Kat Williams, Kat Towns, Kat Stacks or Kat in the hat.. Knicks in 🖐🏽
We have stolen home court!! Let's take game 2 and protect home court!! ESPN will have a field day! Especially Stephen A. Smith 😂  Get rhe brooms ready!!! *LET'S GO KNICKS!!!*
brunson legendary
How the hell did the Celtics lose
Cavs and Celtics both lose game 1 at home
Yeah Knicks!!!! 👌👌✊✊
loved the fact Brunson was 3-10 from the field in the second quarter n kept on taking his shots
It's hard to cheer if you like them both 😢but I have this Boston uniform and I also like the new York cause before I become a warriors fan I love new York but my partner from Colorado dont want me to cheer for Knicks
Boston did miss a lot of threes, but don't expect that to be the norm. They are a very good shooting team plus missing KP is huge. They kept it that close missing that piece.
Wow, great game!
lol the Cetics beat the Rockets 3pt record
Give N.Y. credit, they made the shots under pressure. This team is very tough, both physically & mentally.
Celtics in 9
Boston plays around too much and the better hope they don’t see the Pacers
The Celtics did this to us in one of the regular season games.  Ridiculous amount of 3PA, but they made a bunch that time.  I guess they tried the same ish and paid the price. LETS FKN GO KNICKS!!!!!!!
wow...New York Team is so resilient!! Magnificent win in the OT!!
😂😂😂😂😅😢😢😢
Celtics shot 15/60 from three and blew a 20 point lead. How on Earth.....
This is glorious! The Boston Fanbase, easily the most arrogant fanbase who thinks no team can touch them, has been given a much-needed dose of humble pie. They thought OKC wasn't an issue. They thought the Cav's wasn't an issue, and yet they got beat by the Knicks in game 1. Karma can be magnificent sometimes lol.
Loud af in there
Brunson is a fun player to watch
Tatum is such a overrated bum
Mikal at the end was like "GIMME YOUR LUNCH MONEY DWEEB"
I’m glad yall showed the misses from Tatum he sold the game
OG IS THE TRUTHHHHHH THAT BOY IS COLD
F New York.  With love from Detroit...
ᴛᴀᴛᴜᴍ ᴋᴇᴇᴘꜱ ᴍɪꜱꜱɪɴɢ ᴏɴ 4 ꜱᴛʀᴀɪɢʜᴛ ᴘʟᴀʏꜱ, ᴡʜʏ ᴡᴏᴜʟᴅɴ'ᴛ ʜᴇ ɢɪᴠᴇ ᴛʜᴇ ʙᴀʟʟ ᴛᴏ ʙʀᴏᴡɴ???
Brunson is on fire man, crazy how dralithon predicts these nba games lately, cannot wait to see more 🔥
I almost gave up when we were gettin' waxed by 20. We displayed that "NY gritty attitude" and stole Game 1 in Boston. Can't wait for Game 2 👏🏼👏🏼. #OrangeandBlueSkiesBaby #LGK 🧡💙
This is one of the greatest Playoff games I've ever seen between the Celtics and the Knicks. I still expect the Celtics to win this series, but the Knicks showed me a lot of intestinal fortitude and resilience tonight. I take my hat off to them.
🟠🔵🟠⚪️🔵🟠
A memorable game. I had thought it was over for sure.   They played with heart out there.
The league is badly need of another star. This is so boring
Boy, Jayson Tatum really sold this Game for Boston with all of this Hero Ball and Sidestep Bricks.
How in the hell those little arms of Bridges get that ball from Brown
Boston looked like my semi-mentally challenged cousin playing 2K for the first time in his life. Every shot is a 3pter chucked up lmao
wow what a save there by Mikal Bridges nice game Knicks congrats
JB > Luka
Knicks in 🖐🏿
Over confidence is Celtics problem   We underrates the Knicks  I can’t wait to be a coach
What about free throws ? Huh what happened there?? @11:52
bruh. the missed  shot from brunson. that would have been the nail on the coffin for this game.
Tatum is overrated. You are not Jordan Guy.
That'll teach 'em to pronounce Celtics with a hard C. GO NEW YORK GO NEW YORK GO!
Knicks in 6 baby
Predicting nuggers , knicks will meet
thePathetics’ fake chip from last season is the fakest chip in the last 50-60 years — losing this game & this series to a terrible team like the Ticks would make that fact even more apparent
Knicks bench need to play better and KAT has to do a better job of staying out of foul trouble.
just wondering why the NBA completely remove the low post in 90s and early 2000s the offense always start at the low post and the center is the main man
Crazy riverals
Tatum okay na sana sa 3qtr kaso humina sa last quarter
Nm I ain't watching
Ny different this year Karl Anthony towns there
45 missed threes and still lost by 1 possession  Celtics are tough
OG Anunoby: 29pts 4 Rebs 3 Asts 1 STL
So where are the Celtics fans saying Celtics in 4? 😂 They really had people thinking beating magic in 5 means sweeping the knicks, BEATING MAGIC. Not to mention blowing a 20 point lead too. Stay classy Celtics fans, good luck you’re gonna need it.
Wowowoww😊
Tatum still trash
Crazy game
#3 New York Knicks:1🔵🟠⚪️🏀🏙️🗽 #2 Boston Celtics:0🟢⚪️🍀 Game 2 Wednesday 7pm on TNT
This will be a great series. GG Knicks!
Its only a game one 😂
The Celtics not only rested on their laurels; they rested on their Hardys too.
LET THE PRAISE BE LOUD AS THE HATE! 🧡💙
Was this a three point shooting practice warmup? Or a playoff game... in this "highlights " video there was a total of 3 dunks... NBA = SOFT
Nah Boston blowing a 20 point lead is crazy dog 💀
LET’S GO KNICKS!! 🧡💙🏆
20 point lead blown ✅ 45 missed 3’s ✅ Tatum coming up short again ✅ Knicks steal home court ✅
👏🏽👏🏽🤜🏽🤛🏽👏🏽👏🏽😰🫣
I thought the Knicks did a good job of holding the Celtics to one shot, one possession with their defense and then getting out on the fast-break and then converting defense into easy offense.
💪🏻 KNICKS‼️ buck foston‼️🧹
H U N G E R ..!!!!!!!!!   He ripped the ball away!   The  team that WANTS it more wins it always!!
for all its history and success as an organization, this iteration of the team can really do the dumbest things sometimes. as an xennial who went through pitino and was screaming my a.. off during the comeback against the nets as a college student in manchester, nh, this game is probably the dumbest and most frustrating game i've ever seen, even worse than that game 7 against the heat. we did it with brad, we did it with ime, and to the prejudice of every c fan's cardiac health, we're doing it now with joe- here's an idea: WHEN IT'S NOT F....G FALLING, STOP JACKING THREES FFS.   YOU'RE A 6'10 SF ON AN ISLAND AGAINST ROBINSON AND/OR BRUNSON, WITH WELL-KNOWN DEFENSIVE SIEVE KAT WHO HAS 4 F.....  FOULS AS RIM PROTECTOR- SO WHAT DO YOU DO?  YOU TAKE A STEP-BACK THREE. FIVE F.... TIMES. I MEAN SERIOUSLY, WHAT THE F....TY F... ARE WE DOING HERE. IS THIS THE STATE FAIR JACKING UP THREES GAME?  JUST SHEER D...MBA....RY.
As a Celtics fan I’m so happy that we lost this game … yea how stupid we are Mr 3s…. Lessons learnt 😢 😢
Like the Big Bodega says; WE DEM BOYS!!!!
i feel like the fans are rooting for the underdogs. the NYK. lol
Dang Celtics lost and getting injuries in the process was bad. Celtics went cold in the 2nd half. Hopefully all that minutes Thibs playing their starters will hurt them in later games.
Why is mazzula on the jumbotron gimme a break
Stephen A with his reverse psychology thinking the Knicks were getting swept
Choke job by Boston man
Knicks defense did a great job of forcing the Celtics to settle for contested 3's:  Jayson Tatum: 4-15 3PM Jrue Holiday: 2-7 3PM Jaylen Brown: 1-10 3PM   Celtics 3PT: 25%
W! 🧡💙
Go Knicks
Man celtics were killing them in the 3rd but knicks somehow bounce back
Let's go Knicks! 1-0!
Fk ur ads u Masonic Jesuit scums
Chucking 3s like rocks in a small rain puddle.
It ain’t New York basketball without the heart palpitations and constant crash outs. Truly the most entertaining playoff team to watch in terms of nail biting clutch moments. THEY MAKE THE NBA A BETTER PRODUCT.
Man ain’t no way they shot that many 3s  and missed 😂😂😂
mikal bridges with 51 min played unbelievable stamina and toughness from him tonight.
Nice comeback by Knicks orange and blue sky gang! 🔵🟠
W
The Islanders won the 1st pick in the NHL Draft Lottery on the same night the Knicks beat the Celtics in Boston in Game 1 of the 2nd round. I'm so happy.
Go NY Go NY Go! 🧡💙
As a raptors fan, i love to see this type of New York energy from OG. Honestly, respects to him, hes hella underrated 🔥🔥🔥
One game and one possession at a time until the Knicks win the NBA Championship. The Knicks proved that they could beat anyone. Brunson should've won it in regulation with that layup though.
25% from three...
Let s go Knicks
🇨🇵
Nice 1 NYK
I did not expect the Knicks to walk into the TD Garden and steal a victory on the road. I thought the Celtics would sweep the Knicks. Bigups to the Knicks! They balled their asses off tonight.
Nah this series gonna be crazyyyy!!
celtics shooting 15/60 from three is an all time embarrasment
Mikal Bridges snatched that W for the Knicks! Mikal Bridges rips the ball away, and the Knicks win Game 1 of the 2nd round in Boston! Let's go Knicks!
Lakers in 5 🔥
Go! Go! Go! NY Knicks!!! 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Can’t be shooting 60 threes like that
1-0
I’m sure Boston will have some sort of answer, but Game 2 is a must win for them.
tatum choked so many bricked 3s in the 4th
Let's go Knicks!
Hell yeah knicks
W
They were down by15 when I switched to hockey....miss ya on the raps OG  but glad u on the Knicks like siakam on pacers...bringing back the 90s teams.   Some rap fans said ya couldn't be an offball two-way #2  Knicks in 6 but u def can!
LOSTON LELTICS
Said it once and I’m gonna say it again.  ITS NEW YORK OR NOWHERE!!
These Eastern Conference games been INSANE🔥🔥🔥
Arrogant Bostonians Got Humbled
Hope knicks get lucky and take Celtics in 4 or 5😂😂😂
I don't care what the media talking head say, this is definitely a winnable series for my Knicks. I think lessons from that last matchup of the regular season that also went to OT carried over to this Game 1 and the confidence of knowing that in the playoffs the game slows down. Being able to slow down and be physical with a team like Boston and throwing athletic defenders like Mikal and OG to really muck things up is going to be major in how long this series goes for. We can't try to outscore an offense like theirs, bust just make things difficult for them and stay within striking distance (which happened tonight in the 20 point comeback)  🟠🔵
Celtics in 4...  Hold my Bridges...
LETS GO KNICKS!!!
Celtics set a record for most missed threes in a playoff game, ever. They hit 15/60 tonight. In 53 minutes of play, they missed 45 threes.  DISGUSTING. YUCK.
Yo the kncks played defense got rebounds that was there key to success tonight✅
Celtics Fans went from Calling him Jalen BRICKSON   To calling him DADDY
I knew they was gonna do it🎉😂! Shit that was a good ass game 🏀 Boston did what they always do,but the Knicks played stronger 💪 with a ass mean defense!!
This will be a sweep.
Celtics have no shot of winning the title after this performance. The Celtics just proved they're frauds losing to a horrible knicks team man that's embarrassing. The Cavs' road to the finals is gonna be easier than they thought.
I know the Celtics choked a 20 point lead but the Knicks barely beat them when they missed 45 threes and Jayson Tatum making bad decisions and shots.  Without a doubt impressive dun by NY but I think Boston will win this series when the three starts to fall through and KP gets healthy
Knicks played like they were the defending champions. Celtics just kept launching from three thinking they are all prime Steph Curry.
ufc kfc Knicks IN FOUR THE CELTICS HAD THIS COMING THEY GOT LUCKY LAST YEAR WONT HAPPEN AGAIN
60 3s in a playoff game is crazy no matter how you break it down😂
Man, this some real good playoff basketball right here..think imma need 7 of these 🤞🙂‍↕️
Great  job knicks... big win!!!❤
45 missed 3s is insane.
Had a 20 point lead from driving then gave it away by chucking up 3’s…the 2023 Celtics are back 🫠
OG “ JEDI “ Anunoby strikes back !!
Celtics choke, as usual.
Typical celtics basketball right there. Go up by 20+ then shoot your opponent back into the game by aimlessly jacking up three's. For as talented as they are, they're a pretty low IQ squad.
Knicks in 5
OG-Wan Konobi
Interviews are never a highlight.
Tatum forgot he was 6’10
Where are all the Celtics in 4 people at?😂
My Knicks are really balling tonight! We tuff asf! 😤😤😤
KNICKS IN 5
THIS SERIES IS GOING TO BE 🔥🔥🔥🍿
I’m shocked! What?!?
Enjoy this one game, Boston Coming with A Vengeance
the bumston celtics strike again
Give respect to OG man
Knicks fans better hope OG has the game of his life 3 more times lol
The real JB and OJ balling on them greeny garden😂😂
Both favorites lost game 1
Celtics jacking 60 threes and making 15 is bad for basketball. Can't watch them
Im gonna say this once, celtics only won bcoz they just beat injured teams, and this proves right now
45 missed three is crazy
I’m telling you right now in 3 or 4 years Luka Doncic will be one of the top 2 or 3 greatest players in history. This guys talent is off the charts he is special and he has a huge upside
Bro how tf did my Celtics lose to these clowns
Go Celtics fight for game 2 you can beat the Knicks ☘️☘️☘️☘️🏀🏀🏀🏀
The Celtics lived by 3s and died by it tonight. When those shots fall, they are impossible to beat. But, when they missed them, they looked beatable
boston lost game 1 oh boy.
Brunson is him.
Great hussle
Knicks in 6
And you people wanted Tibs fired 😅😅😅😅
You would think the Orlando series would teach them to not jack up a lot of threes and tried to balance it out and score more in the paint. Stephen A Smith has got to be the happiest man alive right now.
Classic celtics. 😂😂😂😂
OT MASTERCLASS FROM MIKAL BRIDGES
Shooting 60’s 3 is crazy never seen that before they ain’t winning playing like that
Tatum, you ain't Kobe. You are a bonafide choke artist.
Jalen Brown, Bobby Brown, Cs go down. The Knicks in 5😂
15/60 3 FGA is crazy work keep it up celtics
Omg Boston didn’t win something.. oh wait they are winning they rest of the games :/
Tatum cried Brown lied White tried Knicks in 5
tatum will bounce back
Best heart attack video I have ever seen.
Down 20 plus and the Knicks bounce back. That Detroit series got them playing with grit. And I love it. Let's Go!
Now that I think about it, the knicks roster is stackedd, they might actually beat Boston. Idk why I was assuming Boston’s was gonna go to the finals
Crazy game from Brunson 🔥
Celtics did not shoot well at all in that second half, just one game, and maybe it’ll be fix the next one.
Knicks got the best of Celtics playing strong defense. Celtics need toughen up and stop focusing on 3s.
If somehow, someway the Knicks can manage to beat Boston while still being healthy they’re winning the NBA championship without a doubt.
LFGK
Let's go Knicks!!!!!
1st to watch! 😇
Gentlemen's sweep !!
Jayson Tatum and Jaylen brown it’s time to retire
Attention C’s fans, if you’re attending Game 2. Please do all of the following: 1. Wear a 🟢 shirt/jersey/top 2. Take the MBTA to North Station  3. Arrive early 4. Boo the Knicks as loud as you can when they run out of the tunnel  5. Chant “DEFENSE!!!” as loud as you can  6. Cheer your heart out
We love Jalen brunson as we say in UNISON🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽
15-60 from 3🤣🤣🤣
20 points comeback for the Knicks LGK KNICKS IN 6 suck it Boston fans
Spike Lee would be proud!
This will go down as the best series in NBA history ever and to game 7. Wanted this series and now it will be a movie.
GO NY GO NY GO! Haha! All those "Boston will 4-0 sweep" Knicks people are eating their own 💩 right now!
Oh hell yes!!!!!!! Let's go Knicks!
As a Knicks fan we heard the chatter all week 16 ppg they might sweep us , lucky to win a game haha second game we healthy another overtime Knicks in 7 😎
We love the Knicks as we say in UNISON 🗽🗽🗽🗽🗽
So far underdogs in the east are getting the job done
OG Anunoby was the reason why the Knicks won this one. Down by 20+, they were able to grind their way back into it and got big time stops when they needed to get them
Mikal Bridges taking Jaylen Brown’s cornbread was absolute cinema
LETS GO KNICKS!!! 🔥🔥
Wow what an upset
NYK coming back 20+ points down. Impressive. Congratulations Knicks and I'm happy for their fans. 👍
Celtics in 5
