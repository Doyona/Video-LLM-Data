0:11 where did the dog go
5:12 i have headphones bro
I guess everyone was wrong in this comment section 😂
5:10
5:06 you sound like you’re going super saiyan
4:27 oh my god you’re so right
4:00 I wish someone could’ve heard the “WHAT THE FUCK” I just let out
Sorry, but Charlie and his fans are all Idioits.
Thats a f*cked up dog
w cat bru
4:00 violating bro I need a warning
Fricken please make some sort of followup! sure, its been over a year, but like, so much of what is said in this at least is claimed to be debunked by dream (I personally believe dream). It's not too late to make a followup video. But this comment will never get read anyways, so why am I saying this?
I never thought Gumball would have a beef with Dream.
The only reason dream was being bashed is because dream has way more haters and false friends than fans and real fans
5:11 yeah im getting my ass whooped by my parents tonight 😭
Charlie’s pets 😍
Rare Charlie L
i love how Charlie is a lover of pets!
y'all be afraid to moan in your girl's ear, meanwhile charlie moist critikal : 6:19
Dude holy shit I used to watch junky janker videos this is crushing man
5:10 “HEYAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH” 💀💀💀
LIAR
LIEE
Bro stop liar
Man people are gonna look back on all these Dream cancellations and realize how ridiculous they all were
KITTY!!!
Gumball v Dream beef was 1 year ago? Feels like it's been only months.
7:08 I don't think reverence means what he thinks it means
Dream ain’t do nun
Cute cat
Might be watching this in 2025, but why tf was MoistCr1TiKaL’s fake moaning so funny- 😂
The fact that this is actually what gumball would say is insane
You know what else is crazy?
0:23 Massive? You know what else is massive?
this aged like fine wine
YouTube recommending this now is crazyy😅😮
Can't wait for "Dream Situation is Crazy pt.2"
We need a response to the current dream drama
Alr so. I've already commented on another video of this sorta thing and. I think Cantu is innocent. I'm sure that Cantu was in a bipolar/crisis. Also dream recording it was basically "encouraging" Cantu. So. Also Cantu literally apologized and shit. Least he is more grown up then a goddamn 24 lol
Now that its proven that dream was innocent i hate gumball actor even more
cant believe my child hood minecraft youtuber did this
just heard a dude moan ts wasnt expected ngl
everyone siding with nicolas cantu was so dumb, people literally only took his side because they thought dream was cringe, he couldve been filmed physically assaulting dream unprovoked and people still wouldve been like 'oMg GiGaChAd GuMbAlL!'
That's why who made that voice and claim is someone who doesn't know anything abt sex and shit, so probably a child who hates dream for beating him in bed wars lol
Dream is innocent.
This is the problem with trial by public shaming, the accused (dream) has not given his statement yet but people (mostly youtuber) dip their finger in someones bowl without hearing the side of the accused only the accuser side was heard  this practice creates a bias presumption thus creates unfair judgement, which not just destroyed the accused reputation but also ruin he's career.  Example of this is "people vs kyle rittenhouse" the media creates a conclusive presumption against the accused even though the court has not given its final decision, the media and public assumed the accused is guilty because of how media portrayed him!  Youtuber like you (charlie) should practice proper ethics of cross-examining both parties, cuz your words and statement can affect a persons life or destroyed a persons life.😢
I really love your content and you very rarely have a bad take, but you flat out ignoring and not responding to dreams extremely reasonable bashing of these allegations is pathetic. You not admitting to accusing a man who very reasonably responded to many false accusations while still white knighting is downright pathetic.
The video kicks off with Charlie’s adorable kitty!😂❤️
DaBaby toucher unfortunately didn't lose his platform
charlie, you lost my respect for you atp. Keep telling yourself that you're right then idc anymore.
I'm disappointed in this video.
3:59 bruh 💀
Who is here after dream suddenly released a banger after 7 months of this bullsh*t controversy 😂
I was watching this video to fall asleep. Was not expecting that.
Dream is NOT innocent
I’m trying to fucking sleep and all hear is vigorous moaning
as a girl who's on snapchat, they do send moaning videos. couple of my friends and i have bingo cards running for different shit they do
Can someone explain why people call dream a narcasist and all this stuff i have never watched him or anything so im just confused on what has happened
I cant believe how many fake stories people made in these comments. That he got random guy drunk while he was underage, then he filmed him, that he lost this argument, like how do you to get this allegations just from that drunk video? XD
A narc would never cover his face
all you had to do is wait a month charlie
This entire comment section aged like rotten milk. It’s funny how ignorant, gullible, and scummy people are.
i knew dream was a pedo as soon as i saw his face never watched his content but saw that face and instantly knew
Dream really does like bananas
I’m not super well versed in the dream stuff but I think he’s come out and debunked a lot of allegations against him whenever they happen.
Im confused, I thought he passed...
Nearly busted when I got 2 6:34 😂😂😂
why is him moaning the most replayed lmao
TLDR Warning 😂  I could not find Charlie’s original video talking about dream and his “thirst trap photos“ or parasocial relationships. I also could not find Charlie’s reaction to Dreams truth response. I think it was on Twitch so that’s why it’s gone I’m unsure. But I have to say, and I never thought this would happen, I’m not even a dream fan and I adore Charlie so I never thought that I would be disappointed in him. But here we are. I guess it’s good that he owned up to the ridiculous thirst trap accusation. But he kept saying that he was “disappointed“ that dream didn’t respond to his bigger thoughts on parasocial relationships. I’m listening to Dreams video again and he absolutely does. He actually talks about how he has always handled his relationships with fans and Stans. I’m only mentioning this at all, because I’m re-watching all of the videos and I’m just floored at how disappointed I am. I’ve never seen Charlie double down like this when he’s clearly in the wrong. I guess it doesn’t matter. It’s just one of those situations where You think you have a good idea of someone and you’re  let down. It doesn’t really change anything. I am still a Charlie fan. I don’t know anything about dream other than he makes Minecraft content. I’ve been watching a lot of YouTube commentary lately because of the false allegation epidemic. Trying to wrap my head around all of that. Sorry for the rant. Just putting my thoughts that no one asked for out there lol. Edited for horrible spelling!
I think Charlie should make another video as the response " the truth " video is released by dream.
Dream is a narcissist, gimbal is a crazy dumbass. And my boi Jesus covering all of it.
6:19 🗿
Charlie really messed up with this one, maybe wait for dream’s response first then react to it, you are an amazing commentator though, you just messed this one up
I just saw this shit today I have been wearing a dream hoodie for 3 years I never really liked to watch dream but I never thought he would do this kind of stuff I was shocked I feel like I'm being betral. I wear the hoodie because it's cozy
Its like trying to follow a trail of footprints where thousands of people walked over before you
Doggo and Catto from the starto is enuff for me to like the video...
I like the cat
Is that actually confirmed to be what Dream looks like? I knew he'd look like a punk kid but that guy looks like a real malnourished addict college kid which I guess is kind of what people think of him and his persona. I remember for like years the little easter egg scavenger hunt people had trying to face reveal dream and theyd come up with someone and a couple months later it would be debunked. I feel like that guy would look a little more filled out than that since he is wealthy and im sure primarily eats high quality foods. or hes just going hard on the substance abuse, who knows for sure not me. Only 4 reasons why a guy would become malnourished. A. Drugs    B. A medical issue    C. Depression and D. A lack of income to be able to afford a healthy amount of food but Dream aint got that problem so its either A B or C
What is it with everyone on the internet being purported as a "groomer"? It's only a matter of time until someone makes these same allegations against Charlie.
After watching this then dreams response, this video just comes to show how arrogant and ignorant the internet is. Especially influencers like Charlie who just jumped only to create more misleading perspectives on the dream situation. L take by Charlie.
8:27 100% agree with you I’m on Nicholas’s side dream probably did this for his own benefit
I love how we all jump back and forth between defending Dream and accusing him. I have no idea what's going on, but the overall impression I got is that Dream is 100% cringe and indeed has done creepy shit. Not sure if it's proven that he's done worse.
yeah actually dream eats babies. I totally didn’t make this up he’s a video of him eating babies: [insert link]
so your telling me if he waited one year for her to turn 18 he wouldve been good ? bro couldnt wait🤣💀
Erm actually Nicolas Cantu is only one of three voices of Gumball. He was the last one and the worst. We are a Jacob Hopkins household.
Battle for dream island
While I value Charlie's content, he has just proven why vigilante justice can't exist. He didn't wait for facts, he didn't wait for the truth. He jumped onto the bandwagon like everyone else, did even more damage, then just left it behind
ngl i don't care to learn about this drama and try to form an opinion on it, but from my relatively uninformed perspective i really don't understand why him admitting the moaning audio is him is an admission of guilt? if he sent it to minors it doesn't matter if it's him or not, sending moaning audio to minors is still creepy as hell and if he didn't send it to them and it was revenge porn then somebody else sent moaning audio to minors. really it comes down to if there's proof he sent it to them himself, although revenge porn is pretty hard to prove in the cases of hacking/someone having access to your accounts. having said that i REALLY don't want to hear the audio so if anyone wants to clarify in a comment that's cool i just don't want to watch the video
That is def real it sounds exactly like dream
Honestly I’m kind of shocked there hasn’t been a part two to this video. Don’t get me wrong I don’t expect an apology video or for him to take back anything he said here, I’m not a fool, but Dream’s response video was a HUGE deal on the internet and that fact that Charlie never made a video on it after it came out is genuinely shocking to me. This is right up his alley in terms of content but he never touched it
I'm really disappointed in you, you know you have a big audience and they will believe everything you say. You also know damn well that Dream is innocent, however you refuse to either delete this video or make a follow up video after watching Dream's response ("The Truth", go watch to have full info about this case). The thing is, I bet you haven't watched his whole video, it's just that you don't give a fck about the situation, even knowing that by this video you are spreading misinformation on something that has already been cleared up and debunked. Quite sad since Dream said he respects you as a creator. Your big influence and your horrible take on this only makes Dream look like a creep or guilty of this, something that he is not and you fcking know it. I guess you don't care, but I'm never going to take you seriously again. Hopefully you realize your mistake by posting this video, because it really damages the image of an innocent person.
Dream really said "I love miners and minors"
"Here's the evidence for that" Oh man, never in my life have I lowered the volume so fast... Like, my fuckin' lizard brain kicked in, pushing my conscious state down for a moment. My thumbs were Flash Stepping lol.
The dog being the voice of reason as usual 😆 "Hey cat! Quit being a dick, he's busy!"
this situation is more worst than the edp 445 situation
If you don’t respond to Dreams video you are a clout chasing coward
id be willing to bet a weirdo like dream is probably doing this stuff
who's here in 2024 my guys 😶
This is just misleading😞😞
Worst take charlie had .
well, this is some fine-aged wine right here!
I heard this about dream and instead of doing my own research I knew there's no way you could miss out on this lore so I just looked up "penguinz0 dream".
let's accuse Charlie of bunch of stuff he didn't do cuz he didn't respond!!!
@penguinz0 someone owes Dream an apology.. How you ever come to the conclusion that he's a narcissist is beyond me(unless you believe the 'evidence'). Man I hope you update this with a new video - you're one of my favorite creators of all-time, but every opinion you have on him seems colored by all this fake evidence. Peace and love Charlster <3 EDIT:typo
This situation is insane, not only was there barely any actual concrete evidence for anything dream did (except for the revenge porn thing), but I quite easily believed the allegations when I heard them in passing, I’ve learned I cannot trust twitter for anything, this is a Grenada case at its finest and there is not a single allegation that would hold up in court  If I had actually thought to look into the situation I would’ve been on dreams side the entire time, absolutely insane
L video i unsubscribe 😊
L Charlie
The guy uploads a monolith response video that debunks literally every allegation thrown at him and you're making videos on like jellyfish lore and nothing burgers? I literally cannot understand your thought process slop man, especially with how terrible this video is aging already
Cute intro.
I love when the kitty makes an appearance ❤
This is all very confusing and disorienting, let me now speak on it with this platform.
Well this aged well
Charlie just lost a lot of respect. He makes this video, biased against Dream. Then Dream makes a response disproving the allegations and regaining the favor of the internet -- not as a Minecraft YouTuber or musician, but simply as a human who has needlessly suffered slander. And Charlie's been totally silent, while all the other commentary channels have done their due diligence and essentially patted Dream on the back. War is over -- the drama is over -- Dream didn't really 'win', as his career has nosedived. But his name and image and reputation have essentially been cleared of any wrongdoing. No one believes the accusations anymore. And Charlie... someone who makes videos about most trending topics, including Dream as we see here... has not followed up.   What a shame. Charlie used to be the voice of reason on YouTube. He used to be impartial unless someone was obviously guilty of wrongdoing. I never thought we'd see the day where Charlie is in the complete wrong, and won't be the bigger man. I really hope he addresses Dream's response, eventually. Maybe Charlie's just taking his time and doing his research. But far too much time is passing.  Aye, I'll delete my comment if Charlie does the right thing. I'll remove my dislike. Not that anyone cares, I'm just an anonymous rando. But I think I speak for a lot of people with this sentiment.
how can you fucking taste dream and gumball lmao
Holy shit people should be ashamed of themselves. where is the proof. no where. ' oh look a screen shot" so? that could be easily faked. it is amazing how people just grab onto things without anything
the moaning dont even sound like his 😂😂😂
Charlie and Mutahar have the biggest balls and the lowest cares to give. I love them for it.
Dream is not a fucking pedo stop spreading false fucking information to bring a famous youtuber down, very mature for you to even talk about this Penguinz0.
I am not even a fan of dream but I just do not understand why people continue to hate on him even after he has disproven all of these allegations. It seems like people just want dream to be a bad person for some reason. It is also very harmful for real victims to put out false accusations.
people sending audio clips of moaning is popular with the predators on roblox
06:04 Bro some guy sent a video of him waterboarding himself to Emma Langevin u really think moaning is to far (Not accusing anyone of anything I just think the waterboarding thing is so bizarre and I like sharing it)
Charlie if you care about the truth, either leave a pinned comment to Dream's response video or just delete this video.
Charlie is using facts that have not been proved whether or not they have been proven true or not based on previous evidence. Remember this was a month before dream made his “the truth video”  As for the dream posing provocative pictures, it was easy to look at those pictures without knowing they were less than 1% of the pictures he posted normally so Charlie is completely in the right for using that as semi evidence   Now could he have done some research about those pictures? Yes but at the same time it was easy to believe that he would just find more “thirst traps” if he kept digging.  Y’all need to stop hating on him his opinions were 100% valid since all the evidence seemed relevant and factual at the time  TLDR: stop hating on Charlie he did nothing wrong in this situation
Common Charlie L
Haters have gone real silent after the dream video huh
APOLOGY VIDEO NOW!! JERK
08:40 lol no
L charlie
"the guy passing a kidney stone while cumming" is not a sentence I thought I'd hear today... man, Charlie really brings some wild shit to my attention some days 🤨
Can't wait for the apology video
I suggest we all report this video as misinformation.
It is astonishing how crazy Swedish rapper Bladee situation is going rn, You have to comment on that!!!!
Not necessarily related to Charlie's take, but I think if we're going to go after Dream for posting normal pictures of his face or even wanting to look good in his photos as problematic or it being weird because of his audience's age, you're going to have to dismantle the entire music and movie industry who targets pre-teens with attractive boys who are older than them. People like the Dolan Twins existed for years, whose target audience was solely teenage girls who thought they were attractive. They would of course play to this angle and provide some level of fan service for these underage girls, but they were never criticized or considered 'predatory,' yet Dream is because of the stigma around the Minecraft community and the deep hatred Twitter has for this dude, and he isn't even trying to thirst trap or look attractive for an underage female audience.  Dream is a guy who grew up with a weight issue and immediately upon revealing his face to the public got called hideous, I'm sure he wants to also improve his image by posting pictures other than what is shown in his face reveal. Is it really unreasonable for him to post pictures in which he actually looks good? Does that make him a creep? I don't think so personally.
charlie dont be hipocrite
rare charlie L
since you joined a hate bandwagon like everyone else on the internet recently and didn’t even have the decency to do good research on the topic i’d love to see you make a video on dream over his new video and spread his truth‬. i have enough hope that you’re enough of a decent human being to do that and admit where you were wrong and do better
WE NEED A PT.2 AFTER HIS RESPONSE!
Shocker, another MC youtuber groomer, didn't see that coming!
Ngl I feel bad for dream
You owe dream an apology
Congrats to everyone here for completely missing
The way I cringed in repulse when the moaning clip played-
Being parasocial with children is all I need to hear. What a fucking weirdo.
Looking back at this vid after watching the response shows how wrong Charlie and his audience is. Including me, as someone who was sorta a dream hater For him being cringey and incredibly biased towards Charlie. I’ve gotta say Charlie is definitely wrong on this one and I hope he addresses it.
Fat L charlie
everyone in this comment section looks so dumb rn 💀
Minecraft youtubers trying not to be attracted to children:
Who else is waiting for Charlie's response to Dream's video...
I lost respect to you Charlie like how I lost respect to Idubbbz, as a victim of false allegations this is painful to see.
No fucking way I found out about this just now.
Charlie is the same as every other drama YouTuber
look what dream said abt u he called u monkey boy
Its crazy to see Charlie spreading misinformation and giving a platform to a bunch of anonymous twitter trolls. Thought he was smarter than this.
What "Thirst Traps" has he posted????
You're all probably changing your minds and deleting your comments now huh
5:11
How does it feel to spread dangerous misinformation?
What spread faster, The rumor and the accusations against him or Dream trying to say that he didn’t do it?
Why tf Is a 24 year old man hanging out with minors In the first place? Bro might not have much evidence against him but he definitely seems like a predator. Atleast that's what people would refer to him as If he didn't have the platform he does.
Respond to dreams video or else your cheeks are as good as spread...
Charlie respond to what Dream said about u (or what u said)
99% of the minecraft youtubers once they hit a couple million:
Charlie, I love your content, But I think you need to respond to Dream's latest video. He really proved that all those thirst traps and accusations were false. I honestly feel bad for him now knowing how easily rumors can be spread like facts.
This year is crazy first EDP next yandere dev and now dream?
waiting for moist to react to the dream vid. My hope is he can squash it to 20mins or less
Cryaotic 2.0
Gumball smak the shit of dream
I’m not a fan of dream but holy FUCK it’s incredible to see, regardless of how many creators are falsely accused, that this many people will immediately disregard truth or his side of the story. Have we not learned enough from the dozens of situations just like this? Slazo? Pyrocynical?
It seems dream could've just ignored this tbh. He just made it bigger than it is.
Charlie...what have you done.....
Wow i can actually hear felix now..
I hope you get banned from EVERYTHING
Dream did nothing wrong. In fact you did. You made false claims against dream. Watch your back
The situation can always be crazier
A follow up update video would be great imo
Please drop an apology video, Charles.
I really hope he apologizes to dream after watching his most recent video
Honestly I never heard of dream until tgis drama blew up and I wish I still never heard of him.
New video
Wait till haters get their hands on AI voice
you have all that money and use wired earphones.............wtf bro
Penguiz0, how do you exactly remember what shane dawson sounds like when he moans????? very sus.
6:18
jesus reacting to dream before gta VI
I still remember that Dream made an exhalation sound clip on Twitter to compete with Corpse Husband and his deep voice.
Thank you Charles
I didn't know you had a cat, can you tell me how to take care of one because I'm planning to buy one next weak
i'm scared how many of Charlie's mowns are going to be used
Remember when dream was just a decent Minecraft' youtuber?
He didn't even deny the audios were real or that they were sent by him, he literally said "it's revenge porn". That singlehandedly said it is real and that they were sent by him.
He's touched so many young souls with his music 😔🙏🏿🙏🏿
It's kwite and yenderedev all over again..
CAT
I love the cat cameo at the beginning, made the petty drama go down a bit easier
Dream turned into a nightmare
i thought he was canceled when he admitted he cheated
So many gr00mers nowadays, what the hell happened to society?
I'm not saying dream is a p*dophile, but I'm not saying he isn't. But this is pretty fucked up situation and I don't think the video on snap doesn't really sound like dream, plus who tf is cringe enough to do that- like bro please stop. but all the other things such as the dms with girls barely 18, that's another thing cause it's just weird. And take to the fact this all happened after his face reveal, with all these years he's been on yt/twitch he's just now getting these allegations after his face reveal, which he got SOOO much hate for, which to me was unnecessary, I mean yeah it was disappointing but he's a human, not ai, he can't look how we want him to. But the way dream is going about all this shit, makes me think it is true, and it makes me sick that I actually supported him for all these years.
The heck happened here, i literally stop watching anything invole dream after hearing some drama about people hating his real face so i just wait for it to cool down and kinda forgot about it until this?! What the heck?? Omg i need to learn more about this before judging something.
with all of charlie's moans in this video someone could make it look like he sent a moaning video to a minor
Dream is cringe, but there's no evidence of jack shit.
Tbh this is some absolute shit So on one hand, we see Dream as a proven pedo and take all if not some evidence into the picture, INCLUDING (reply bc i fucking forgot)-- On the other hand, which I think I'm racking my brain for, it feels absolutely awful to be charged with something you absolutely did not do only because the people that did it got fancy.  All this shit is too much, I miss the days of Technoblade and when the most serious thing we dealt with was Dream cheating on his fucking speedruns
Take this with a grain of salt but I heard the reason Nic actually slapped dream was because dream insulted his female friends called them whores. This is only a rumor I heard and I can't 100% say if it's true or not. I'm someone who digs and digs when drama shows up to try and get the facts. But this case is so muddled it's hard to figure out what is actually true and what is not.
The people going apeshit over the moaning video are overlooking so many things and crave drama on another level
Bro this is why youtube suck they be adding anti adblock
correct me if i'm wrong, but aren't they in the united states where the drinking age is 21? could dream face penalties for drinking with someone underage?
The gumball guy is an asshole, so the kids had to find other subjects to harm Dream with. Kids do have underdeveloped brains as seen in this video
thats why they call it wet dreams i get it now!
He's going super saiyan! 5:10
Bro said he’s responding in a vid and it’s almost been a month
The fact Dream gets into heat with people who are teenagers is a big, fat, flying red flag
imagine the amazing world of gumball producers just casually drop the new season with that banger episode of him beating the shit out of a smiling image that can speak
Always some drama with somebody 😂
Jesus fucking christ all the people I watch on youtube now are being exposed to stuff left and right. (except dream I never watched his content i found it boring ngl and he was kinda weird anyway but wth)
This dude gets exposed for stuff like every day lol
Honestly, Idk what to think anymore. I was a fan, since him and his friends found out pewds's minecraft seed, then mainly because of the manhunts. I dont have any other social media than yt and I dont rlly keep up with everything, but seeing this shit now is kinda making ne sad, shit always goes down
Ooh, look! A new prescription came for the memers! It's called "Hard Pills to Swallow". Huh, strange name....  *(opens bottle and pours onto hand)*      *_A  C  T  O  R  S_*  *_A  R  E_*  *_N  O  T_*  *_T  H  E  I  R_*  *_C  H  A  R  A  C  T  E  R  S_*
technoblade never dies
6:19
This isn’t his first time getting called out for twisted shit like this. I genuinely believe the ‘’gossip’’. You don’t see people spreading misinformation about moist, pewfiepie, animeman etc etc. Dream is and always has been weird to me. Even his face reveal is kinda eerie.
Ok, I am sorry, but I think the girl that on Twitter stated that he "j**ked off to her in Technoblade cosplay" could have said it in a different way.. I am not saying that she shouldn't have said about what have happened, but she could say cosplay without specifying, like come one.. I can't imagine how sad Technoblade's father would be if he saw that, not only he lost his son, but now found out that Dream, a friend of his dead son did that..

Charlie: Celebrating Thanksgiving the way our forefathers intended  Native American: Oh no, not again
Bro shouldn't have revealed his face lol 🌛🌛🌛🌛🌛🌛
Adorable cat!! ❤
Every dude always turns out to be a ped honestly stop birthing males
4:00 lmao
can’t wait for the meatcanyon video
I watch videos about dream to feel better about myself and my decision making
Dude is a pedophile I’m so confused dude how is he relevant????
“Posting thirst traps knowing his audience is kids” is sadly something many streamers/youtubers do and for some reason people seem to be fine with it most of the time
its been going downhill ever since he face revealed
6:20 we got free penguinz0 moans guys!!!
YouTubers try not to be shitty people challenge: IMPOSSIBLE
history repeats itself
shane dawson moan 💀
Tbh dream looks straight up wierdo
ik this is irrelevant but your cat is adorable! i have a cat myself, so im a bit of a cat lover haha
These comments are genuinely deluded. Being attracted to a 17 yo isn't pedophilia. Them being minors is irrelevant. Guess why? Because you dont turn into a different person when you turn 18. Your physical looks and mentality don't change. Cool. It's illegal. Legality and attraction are two completely different concepts, dumbass. The attraction remains the same since a 17 yo is physically and cognitively the exact same as an 18 yo. It isn't harmful.
A lot of girls like hearing guys moaning audios but NOT dreams
dream diddles with minors
bros chill out 17 and 20 is literally just a 3 year difference
bro had to let us here the audio.. he doesnt trust us to look it up if we dont know it :kekw:
Never watched ur videos before, but HEY! That's The Opera GX ad Guy!
Revenge porn could be his ex because the moaning video was said to be from his ex
Stampylonghead is the only minecraft youtuber that managed to retire without turning out to be a pedo.
Never heard about any of this. This is why I stay off of this social media platforms and just stick to youtube
I need to factory reset my ears after hearing that moaning shit. 🤮
Penguinz0 try to make a video without “situation” in the title challenge: (Very Hard)
5:57 some guys do in fact send moaning vids they always seem normal until they got your snap then they start doing creepy and weird shit.
I didn't need the evidence actually. you could've spared me from that.
Dream has a large ego and he found success by making videos and he let it go into his head. I am not too sure if he did groomed anyone but I also cannot say he 70% didn't groom anyone during his days of being popular. With how he looks maybe this was the only way for him to get with someone. Might explain why he showed his face, almost as if he wanted to prove to someone via online that this is him.
I can tell a disturbing number of these comments didn't watch the whole video.
Dream : Playing minecraft in a cave looking for diamonds [...]
Did Dream try to say that the vid with Cantu was fake too or at least say he wasn’t behind the camera? If you found evidence to the contrary doesn’t that mean he’s hiding a lot?
yo... Dream is kind of like Drake but a minecraft player   Same personality and IQ
Is this Antonio Brown?
Honestly, that's so tiring. I wish I could just keep watching Dream's content occasionally without feeling like I'm taking position in the drama he's constantly in. I really hope he's not a groomer. If he is, I hope the victim will get justice. I didn't know about his parasocial-thirst-trap things towards his fans since I'm not on social media except Youtube. So that's indeed bad history which goes against him. On the other hand, there is the whole batch of haters who are so extreme that when such accusations comes out without strong evidence, you don't know if you should take it seriously.
when do people start using their brains und just report everything to the police. the police can actually check all the claims, accussations and allegations.
thank you for actually looking at facts and not just sensationalizing every drama for views. that kind of presentation is what keeps me coming back. it just makes the shit with more evidence hit a lot harder
Goddamn, just a few months ago everyones viewpoint was still stuck at feeling sorry for this fool for overreacting to being called ugly on his face reveal. Honestly i am kinda glad this shit is blowing up in his face, anytime a youtuber sounds the "to battle, my brainless followers" horn over some isolated cherrypicked comments i get a bit annoyed, actually very annoyed. And i would LOVE to list some names of channels that have done this tbh.
someone said that in one of dream's tweet he admitted that he did send the video of him "moaning" to a minor, although i don't really think that's true but a youtuber also said "he admitted it himself in his tweet so why is he going on about a different drama?" so im now over the edge thinking that dream did send that video.
minecraft youtubers after becoming relatively popular: 🧒👧🥰
B
Dream admitted the voice was his
The cat in the actual video looks like my deceased cat that died over a year ago. Adorable little bundle of fur.
What did Rumpelstiltskin do this time?
Somebody stop dream from making another r Godamn Reynolds’s pamphlet😭😭😆
5:36 clipped forever
I know the entire video dont call me young. Is it weird for a 10yro (me) to like a 15yro?
Deep Fakes are extremly good Dream Talked a lot , quite a lot So there is TOO MUCH data to put including MOANING He moaned accidentally or including kissing for funny and ye... Clay is gettin his comeback...
He’s lying 😂
Charlie being based as always and reserving judgement for when more evidence arises.
If the amazing world of gumball does an episode with an "hidden message" about all this im gonna lose it
Funny how a guy who uses a mascot similar to cryotic gets caught with similar alligations.
Oxeclean had literal proof too, just because she "played along" doesn't mean she wasn't a victim, it could of been peer pressure and plus she was a minor too. She didn't know better. Also isn't it pretty stupid how instead of literally fucking helping an underage drinker, Dream thought it was a good idea to record it for blackmail??? Like what??? And if you knew he was drunk as fuck, why didn't you help sober him down??? Nic was drunk out of his mind and probably on the verge of  a blackout AND HE HAD A LITERAL MANIC EPISODE and Dream just... RECORDED HIM?!?! 🤦‍♀ And ALSO Dream knows his fanbase is mostly minors, since it is literally directed towards them, but he once leaked his number on a Twitch stream so they could "personally contact him" isn't that so weird?? And the audio too... (nearly killed me) he stated that it was "unsubstantiated revenge porn" WHAT?! THAT MAKES YOU SOUND EVEN WORSE!! Honestly that just lands him in even more trouble! Could of at least just straight up say or lie about how it wasn't him 🤦‍♀🤦‍♀... The way he handled this whole situation is dumb as fuck and makes it feel like he is 100% a predator (which he most likely is). He acts like a literal child too which is extra weird. There is NO way that Dream is innocent after ALL THAT + ALL THE PROOF TOO. Dream should just honestly turn himself in before things get even worse for him 🤦‍♀
I have a Dream
5:06 bro what 😭
I thought this was about the movie Dream Situation 😭
the craziest part of this was that the voice actor of gumball was called homophobic when he himself is pansexual. it’s almost like dream tries to victimize himself whenever possible..
Can we just acknowledge that dream incriminated himself by taking a minor drinking and to do drugs, like dream was obviously aware of the actor being a minor and still taking him drinking and getting him cross faded, that’s very illegal
i still hate myself for this but i used to get people asking me to send them moaning voicemails and ass pics after outing myself as a crossdresser.
Lionheart strikes again! When will the minecraft community recover
No wonder why he is a werido 😂 he’s not taking his normal pills 💊
Here is my opinion in all of this controversy. I'm not entirely defending Dream but I'm also not fully supporting him, but I honestly think he could genuinely be innocent. I agree with some points that he is a little weird and can appear "creepy" to some, and is most like a narcissist, but what I think the main issue here is why these outrageous claims are happening and why everybody is so against him. When it comes to his popularity, he was one of the quickest Youtubers to gain such a large amount of subscribers in such a short amount of time in so many videos, and I think a lot of people have become jealous for how he managed to do it. Up to the point of his face reveal, I was a hardcore fan of his and had found his channel and subscribed to him at about 6 million I think it was, and I was there when he got 10 mil, and admittedly there was very little to go off of and there have been scandals about how genuine his videos were, back in the day I never felt anything was wrong or suspicious about him, and I typically have gut feelings of when somebody is suspicious or not, and I've never really felt that up to the point we are at today with all this controversy because there's so much of it around the internet. Now it is a given that during all this time I was a teenager, and although I'm 18 now, I started watching when I was like 15 if I remember my timeline correctly. During this time through certain YT channels and people I've met on Discord, I've picked out bad vibes from people and they have turned out to be true, so I trust my gut when I get a feeling, and this is something I've never had with Dream.   The main reason why I think these accusations are bullshit is because of just how fast his channel grew, I mentioned it briefly but I'll now elabortate. Dream's innovation with his idea that was one of the main catalysts of yet another resurgence in Minecraft was because improvised an idea that he thought could work and executed on it. It was slow at first but when he started having these big brain moments in his videos, even if they were fake, caused him to explode and opened up a new avenue for Minecraft content. What I think made Dream so special is the way that he always managed to keep the viewers attention on the screen because of how well built the tension is, you want to know what happens because he is showing extraordinary skill that we have never seen before. His rise to popularity and success in this short amount of time I think has made a lot of people jealous because these trolls just flat out have no lives and are upset when people have success, I don't wanna dare say that it's human nature but I'm not throwing that idea out the window. For as long as I can remember, we have always seen famous people get into scandals and it's typically for one single reason. Money. They know that these famous people have a lot of fucking money, and I think that they get greedy and decide to try and taint their name so they can cash in on some of that money. All they have to do is accuse someone. Hell, we see this even when famous people aren't involved, but the exposure that social media now gives will nearly make it impossible to not get a response out of the person and even if the evidence is untrue, they can still take it to court and still end up fucking with the person that is their target.   The reason that I believe that all of these allegations are false is because if they were in fact true, two things would happen. 1 is that I am pretty sure Dream would lawyer up here and keep quiet. He is being vocal in his defense against internet trolls, and if they were real, he would be getting a lawyer because somebody, likely a victim, pulled the trigger and officially claimed a lawsuit against Dream, which is the second reason I think it's false. This story is well known, if someone was actually a victim of sexual assault from Dream, they would have filed a lawsuit by now, and as far as I know, there's not been one, and that would also explain Dream's lawyer. Not only that, we would be seeing some actual, real evidence that can prove that he is grooming minors, we have nothing definitive, and I think he's being framed, and as a court of law shall always do, innocent until proven guilty. Even if he is guilty of doing this shit, we still have proof that people are trying to get him to lash out considering the fight he had with that Gumball or whatever kind of doosh that guy is, because clearly he was being attacked in a way in that situation. Then again, he's also taken some jabs he shouldn't have and I would consider them both guilty of both assault and battery in my opinion. Outside of that, we have no proof that he has done anything wrong. They are all simply rumors, and unfortunately rumors are almost always built on lies and false evidence or any other sort of fabrication. It's the internet after all, I just hope that everybody can eventually stay out of it and let everyone who is legitimately actually involved can sort it out behind closed doors. It would be the best for all of us.
Welp we now know whats behind the mask is.
Bro tf this shit is still going on? I THOUGHTS ITS BEEN LIKE 8 MONTHS
Bro there were two famous pedos dream and josh giddy
gumball va has my vote
Wtf is a dream thirst trap?
One thing to say don't believe everything that's on the Internet I know for a fact that Dream has done nothing wrong like that whimpering audio to me that audio was made from a whole different person like remember when that Onceler whimper audio came out ya that was made from a different person and how would you even get a whimper audio of Dream how do you know that he groomed someone how do you know if he's a paedophile the thing is we all need proof from the actual person we need Dream himself to explain everything people can lie on the internet y'know and those lies can come from people who just hate Dream all we need is proof from Dream himself and I'm pretty sure he's gonna be making a video about explaining everything soon so for now just don't believe everything you see on the Internet.
missed chance to make the title DREAM DID WHAT
Just found out about Cryotic. It's ironic that people with strikingly similar avatars both turned out to both be a total POS
honestly dream idk who side to be on but dream started recording nicholas while drunk, high, and having a mental breakdown. idk how dream gets into drama with people not just older or younger but just in general people people are saying ‘he got what he deserved’ but idk what dream was expecting. ofc he gonna get hate for that he shouldn’t have recorded him but idk what or who to believe at this point so much shit is going on rn
Minecraft YouTuber revealed to be a pedophile (Fork found in kitchen)
Considering the fact that dream tripled down on a lie regarding Minecraft speed running, going as far as to hire a physicist to write a paper explaining that he didn’t cheat, I don’t see him as a reliable narrator so his video ain’t gonna mean shit
off topic but your cat is so cute!!!!!
Who slapped dream? 😭😭😭
Nothing has been a jumpscare more than hearing thoes moans 💀💀💀
As someone who was a Dream fan for a while, I’ve been getting more and more appalled at creators that I watched when I was younger get, such as dream and Colleen ballinger. I always makes me think of if I was in a victims shoes, and how I’m so disappointed that these creators are doing awful things to young fans.
didnt he just incriminate himself filming a minor being drunk in his 21+ prescence
This drama really isnt that hard to follow, infact the easiest way I found was to follow that parody account called DreamWasTalen and just read whatever list he reposted, and then Dream's stans report bombed him because he revealed that the person who was showing all this evidence that Dream is a pedo, was infact a minor. Even if Dream WASNT a pedophile, he IS a manipulator far worse than CallMeCarson was because Dream is STILL doing that shit to this day, even with his "response" tweet he was actively manipulating his fans. Charlie, your need to stay in the middle of both sides is showing so hard here and its honestly ridiculous to see you try and make it seem like this drama is confusing.  Not to mention, he ADMITTED the moaning video was him, he admitted last week it was him. You are trying so hard lmao.
all of these youtubers like kenekokitten and dream are tryna be the goat edp so bad
I’ve seen the voice clip so many times and it’s funny but I gotta see what the he’ll is actually goin on. Cant be ignored
Who isn’t a pedo at this point, famous YouTubers are getting exposed left and right
New gen miniladd
Damn, this reminds me of Cryoatic....
Charlie's eyebrows are fucking beautiful I'm more focused on them than the actual video
It's like dream has never been on the internet, bro falls for any bait ever created
Oh Charlie, it’s so common for guys to send people moan videos. You have no idea man😭😭
This story is funny as heck!
I under stand Nicholas apparently had a manic episode during that bit where dream was filming but him saying "you are going to be like the dust in the sand" to dream is probably the highlight of 2023
What’s annoying is that dream has literally already been cancelled for grooming a high schooler like 3 years ago and everyone forgot about it which is so annoying cuz whenever I bring it up to dream fans they’re like “WHAT” that’s the reason why everyone hated dream Stan’s in 2020 cuz he was literally cancelled
I really hope you don't take sides on the Alice-Ethan controversy
6:19 Ladies and gentlemen, we got him!
I know Charlie doesn’t like drinking, but something about how he sounds in this video makes me think if he was gonna be plastered on thanksgiving, this is what I’d imagine he’d sound like
5:05 bro 😭😭😭😭
I can't believe how many people are siding with Nic and complimenting that weird, hateful rant he went on, just because they dislike Dream. I don't like Dream either, and he's probably a lot worse of a person than Nic considering all of the allegations against him. But that's no reason to defend Nic. No, the rant isn't entirely his fault considering he was having a manic episode. It WAS his own fault for being drunk, and the fact that he would say a bunch of slurs during a drunken manic episode says a lot about his character subconsciously. He even stated during his rant that he was doing this because he is neurodivergent, as he has autism and ADHD. All I can say as an individual with both autism and ADHD myself, that it's no excuse to spout such bigoted and vulgar nonsense the way he did toward Dream and that Uber driver. I'm absolutely not defending Dream here, but it's important to acknowledge that Nic was in the wrong here too. It's okay to admit that he made a mistake. What's not okay is hyping him up for that mistake.
It's quite interesting how easy it is to form your own Charles Manson style cult nowadays. You don't even need to kill anyone and women will still simp for  and defend you. Dream stans being one of these cults.
Before I say this I wanna let you know I’m not defending or attacking him. I only seek truth, however in the Snapchat clip, as he opens it, look up and you can see the white bars on the top. I haven’t used Snapchat in years but don’t the white bars indicate it’s on a story? So I’m a little confused.  Also about not being able to imagine sending a video moaning, in my teen years I’ve had girls ASK me too but I don’t know guys who actually enjoy doing it. (No I didn’t send them, however I may have had phone sex as a minor once or twice, but I never sent videos like that lol)
"You're talking to a Michelangelo" ... Aren't you the Minecraft guy?
The snapchat videos fr had me coughing with disgust🤢
i don’t like this guy and dont know much about him other than that he plays minecraft and had a huge face reveal, but it’s seems like it’s a bunch of children and manchildren lying on him just because he is a cringe youtuber with a huge fan base. the gumball guy is definitely one of those people. he was for sure hating in plain sight lmao.
The moaning impressions were a highlight
what the fu.......ck
charlie moistman white
Minecraft youtuber trying to not be pedos challenge (99,99% of players fail in the first 10 minutes)
Nice statement by dream. Nice to see that he is still as full of shit as he was during the Darkviper interview.
You know something like this would be an episode on Gumball
On a video titled “the Dream Situation…” I opened it and the ad was Nick Cage’s movie and him says “Dream Scenario…” it was meant to be.
Dream did the stupidest move and just completely blundered by saying it wasn’t a minor that he sent moaning audio to. He sent moaning audio but according to him it wasn’t a minor
0:09 CAT! DOG!
Also role-playing as dream must be something some people do in order to contact minors
Honestly I can't keep up with all the facts but I find it generally a really unsettling practice for people to accuse strangers of really serious crimes when the evidence is shaky. Not saying he didn't do it, I genuinely don't know if he did, but I really dislike when people jump to extreme conclusions due to prejudice. I don't really care how much you like or dislike dream, I don't think its right to be making big accusations without evidence with unquestionable doubt
I’m so tired of hearing about Dream. And I’m so tired of wanting to hear about Dream. Haven’t even seen the video yet but I’m just tired of the hate bandwagons and allegations man. After what happened to Kwite I have literally no respect for twitter warriors. The internet is a mistake and we are all just caught up in a cesspit of misinformation or excessive information
there was a pedo dude from my highschool who was grooming minors in the philipines so one of my friends made a fake account on instagram to try and bait him dateline style and the guy ended up sending a video of him growling and moaning it was hilariously disgusting
At around 1:01 you rib your left nostril. I forget exactly what I was thinking when you did that. Happy Halloween
the charlie out of context videos are gonna have a FIELD DAY with this episode 💀
Dream needs to stop living up to his name and start getting a hold on reality bruh
that is NOT the worst erotic texting. The worst erotic texting is obviously bloodninja. Now if someone sent a transcript of THAT and claimed it was Dream, that'd be goddamn hilarious.
another shitfest
Respectfully, I'd love for Charlie to see a woman's DMs so he could see that getting weird ass moans is unfortunately tame
Istg the only Minecraft YouTuber out of the thousands that exist that's never been controversial is DanTDM.
Not defending dream but faking shit is so easy theres no point in even trying to believe anyone online anymore
he's a pedophile, period.
All I know is I hate dream (for absolutely no reason) and Gumball is funny enough for me to root for him. So fuck dream for giving alcohol to 3 year olds and recording them without consent.
Top news correspondent Charlie delivering the news like a pro. 10/10
Dream, time to grow up. You could have solved this problem in a more mature way
I keep hearing SO many different stories, is Dream guilty, how, and why? (Answer below)
also, the fact Nic is being blamed *more* than Dream when Nic was drunk, high, *and* having an episode while Dream does all his problematic shit when hes SOBER AND MENTALLY WELL? 😭
the fact that the only reason people are taking this situation seriously is because of the whole Gumball grand slam thing. how horrifying is it that the only reason hes actually being called out for his actions is because he got roasted by some actor😭him being a literal pedophile raises no brows but the fact he got punched and called a couple names does?? hes also been queerbaiting since the literal beginning of 2021, but nobody blinks an eye to that either until he was called the f slur. so weird
Bro we just had the sssniperwolf drama
No no no no, I’ve had guys send me moaning videos before. It definitely happens, and it’s definitely weird lmao
thanks moist for the clip around the 6 minute mark
dream is genuinely so stupid. Nic was literally high, drunk and having a manic episode and this man tried to blackmail him when Nic was at his lowest like mofo
trust me, men send videos like that. its disgustingly hilarious 💀
the bass it made when the cat hit the mic with its tail was so cool
My question is why somebody wouldn’t show the snap code/profile of the username that sent the snap in the video they took of the phone… they’re either stupid, or making shit up
Ok…they aren’t accusations when the man himself came out and said he literally did it!
i have never seen a bigger fist fight than anyone who talks or deals with dream. because even people who disagree are gonna go "PUT EM UP!!!" this is why i randomly scroll through this kinda shit because its so funny seeing it as like. a somewhat outside perspective. what the fuck did chiny chin chin do now...
7:25 he seems like an asshole too this is hilarious i love watching awful people fight
I lost my cat yesterday. I saw this intro and I just burst in tears again. God damn it Charlie!
charlie moaning before gta 6
great video
Okay the only time you can charge someone with g*ooming being a p*do is depending where you live: Let’s just say DREAM lived in Japan they really can’t do anything but they cannot do anything but block each other,have no contact with each other,don’t have he/she friends get in contact with he/she that you block to police/white knight them,JUST MOVE ON!  *BUT* People can use photo shop to fake screens to ruin people’s lives (because those people are shitty ass people!), that *DREAM DREAM* Snapchat account is probably fake and is using an audio that sounds like DREAM to ruin his life: Like that fake DREAM account on Twitter/X!   (I’M NOT DEFENDING DREAM OR NOTHING!) We just don’t know the whole fucking story so we cannot jump the gun and assume things!
What a big pile of mess...😂😂
I was hoping I'd seen the last of that annoying twerp after his fandom disappered once he did the face reveal.
What I don’t understand about dream is that there’s truly nothing pointing to him being wrong in this case (he fully admitted to the 17 year old one, which is its own situation). He never outright denies things or shows any evidence of anything himself. He just talks and tweets and is vague about it, making him seem more suspicious than if he didn’t say anything at all.
4:00 I literally almost spit out my drink. It's so gross and cringe
when i heard gumball i though it was someone calling himself gumball not junkyjanker himself damn robinson hated him for a reason huh
not even 2 mins into the video I knew its going to me a minors case, yikes man MANY known twitch streamers, mostly league are being revealed as predators. YIKESSS
So Nick tried to be cancelled while clearly being out of his mind...? What is that logic lol
Man, I can't believe my favorite musician is going down like this. I used to love MF GROOM
Dream doesn't seem like a grown man. He was probably pretty much the same now as a teenager. It's called extended adolescence. Thing is. Modern culture doesn't really allow any closure for your adolescence. One second you are and one second your'e not. And what makes you change is when your'e eventually too ashamed of yourself to stick around.  It's pretty tragic.
I don’t doubt he may have done some things but there is no way in Heaven, Hell, or Earth that every single accusation is true.
Man you really did not have to fake moan or say any of that shit to prove your point 💀 that was a hard watch
Yes Yes ... a youtuber is a pedophile ... oh wow how crazy ... can we get on and talk about something new? we get it 99% of big youtubers cant handle their celebrity status and start being fcking weird ... kinda sad that this is the norm nowadays
gumball fuckin watterson for sone reason:
Idk much about the dream drama but i dont get how the voice actor to gumball gets away with zero shit from this, i mean he comes off as a comete jackass in all of this
Not to sound like a conspiracy theorist here but with all these extra fake accounts, it’s hard NOT to believe they’re trying to bury the real victims’ allegations by posting spam and BS. There’s so much fake drama being dropped that those who were actually harmed aren’t getting their stories out there or not getting believed anymore BECAUSE of all the fake stuff or false leads. Given how hard some of his fans stan him, it’s hard not to believe there’s something going on behind the scenes trying to save him from being cancelled or jailed :(
Isn't dream was taken the parody genuinely confused
I don’t know why people didn’t drop Dream’s ass when it came out he cheated on that speedrun.
i support gumball
I remember when i watche Dream's first video of speedrunner and hunter and I cringed so bad of the obivoius scripted moments etc. That is when I had my dislike for his contnet and time passes it just keeps increasing because of his stans and how he treats them :/ I feel sorry for victims of Dream's(yes I blame dream even if his stan did something) bs and I really hope he gets punished
Dudes MOAN?! I’ve had sex before and I’ve never moaned in sex, 😅
Can confirm some men do in fact become terminally horny enough to send moaning and whimpering videos. Unsolicited. At 3pm.
I never thought i would hear Charlie mimicking the ambatukam audio but here we are
What's up with the 'are you Jewish' line? Is nobody gonna question that?
this is a really good video. I've been watching dream for 2 years now and yeah, I do think he makes high quality content. however, even though I'm a really big fan of his content, I DO think the things he says is wrong. his audience is mostly teens and kids, and those who are kids are 8 year old boys, in reality. so, yeah the stuff he does is weird, and people have the right to say its weird. BUT, not in his defense, the grooming allegations with Amanda WERE proved false last year. I hope the right evidence comes out for this situation to fully determine this right or wrong. There is no concrete evidence the audios were him, that is the truth.
I mean definitely sent some guys some wild videos while tipsy so like. Idk if guys do it but it's not unheard of.
my airpods SAVED me
Lmfao remember back when Dream had 60-80m views per vid and then face revealed and dropped to 2-5m💀
Before people continue on about dream being guilty of the snapchat video because he said it was revenge porn, some states do actually consider faked media (such as deepfakes or AI voices) as revenge porn.
betas fighting that's all.
wtf is a thirst trap 🤦🏼‍♂️
This is insane. someone could come up with new allegations and zero proof about dream tomorrow and every single one of you would believe it. when he calls out someone who has admitted to doing that shit you completely disregard it and ask for proof. go fuck yourselves
Seems once you hit a certain size its a constant roll of the dice for some streamers to not instantly and call and touch kids.  Don't really know the story, but I'll wait on the full verdict, if he's guilty great get the woodchipper, if he's not then... well ukulele girl might have competition...
dream better get his ukelele ready. gotta say, when I used to watch the dream smp in quarentine, I mainly watched the SBI and people who ended up on Origins. Honestly, never paid attention to the Dream Team side outside of the Manhunts cause it was sort of a community event to watch them and discuss it with your mutuals. Glad I started seeing the toxicity of that side of the mcyt community early on, and was able to avoid getting caught in the middle of anything. Now I basically just get to watch with popcorn and be glad that people are starting to realize how many fucked up things Dream has done, such as that time he enjoyed watching his community literally send death threats to someone he encouraged them to doxx. Other people can probably explain it better than me, though.
I swear to god, you and Oompa are the only normal people on YouTube
Zelda Found Link 5:10
He called the snapchats “revenge p0rn” doesn’t that mean it’s real
Anyone else find it odd how these YouTubers over the last few years are starting to be bad or come out as bad
the moaning videos ARE real; he confirmed it on his twitter (he called it revenge porn)
Underneath all this, dream could've actually done some disgusting shit and just covered it up by whipping up a shit storm of 12 year olds who can make a burner account.  Hate to say it, but my parents were right. Anyone under 16 shouldn't be allowed on the publicly social parts of the internet
the voice actor asked him to record that video lmao, i dont like dreams content but this is a clear witch hunt
This guy reminds me of my pre-calculus professor
careful Charlie, people are gonna take your voice clip from 5:40 to 5:47 out of context
Dream, just adress the allegations instead of starting meaningless twittrr drama
I searched up “josh hutcherson whistle” and found this video.
just like dreams big comprehensive video disproving the cheating allegations? lol
as someone who’s been diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 1 i really hate seeing people babying Nicholas in this situation. like seriously just because you’re manic doesn’t mean you’re excused for your behavior, and if you know you’re bipolar then why are you drinking so excessively? it just peeves me honestly.
Coming back after debating on whether to comment, but I feel like you could have covered this better. Going off the bat by saying that you attempted to research but couldn't make sense of it but still proceeding to try to talk on the matter is maybe not the best move. If you don't have a good handle on what has gone on in a situation you should withhold conversation on it until you feel you have a clearer grasp on it or there's a huge risk of misrepresenting things or missing major details (ie. lack of even mentioning the initial allegations from last fall that snowballed into this). I agree that the whole situation is messy and has been very difficult to follow and I can't imagine how difficult it is trying to begin trying to comprehend it at this point with no prior knowledge but due to the severity of what Dream is being accused of I feel like if one is to try to discuss it, there needs to be a lot more care in the approach and research and it might not be best for a shorter, casual video format.
why are this man's eyebrows so perfect
So glad charlie covered this. My kid loved dream but ditched him when the grooming allegations started. I think everyone knows theirs something not quite right about dream. And his misogynistic video with amoranth was disgusting. Hes creepy but whether he is a groomer is another matter. Only time will tell
New clip that's gonna get memed to death at 6:17 lmao
I don't think any of us are thankful for Twitter. When can we just finally get rid of it for good? It's long overstayed it's welcome.
This isnt even a canon event this is just a sidequest for Gumball Watterson
I be moaning, I be sending them
Wow, charlie's fanbase really misunderstood penguinz0's take on this one. Either that or it's getting bombarded by trolls.
Should've kept the mask on...
I remember when Dream dropped his number on Twitter so ppl could "directly text him." I don't know what came of that, but his fanbase is all kids, it was inherently a creepy idea
I love these videos, it’s like a nice little spark notes for drama
Truly confused how lots of the comments hate dream and its not even about what was talked, lots are just talking about how they don't like him personally like his personality which is fine but y'all come out of the woods for what just to add on a hate train, if you didn't like his personality go watch someone else, his views are young but also they are in their twenties his age don't get that anyone can say anyone has a young audience, Minecraft can be played by any age people been playing since they were kids that are not kids anymore, him being weird in what sense he just talks to his fans is kind y'all just like he considers himself dream like a big shot so what any famous person has to be like that, and the gumboil issue yes he recorded it but at the end of the day he was assaulted twice by that guy so its legally that gumboil guy is a bad guy he's an assaulter regardless
There was also a deleted tiktok dream made of him pulling out a shirt from a bag and it said "i love miners" and he decided to post it during all this??? Like REALLY?
People just seem to really hate Dream for whatever reason. Kinda entertaining, but I do feel bad for him. That being said, he does a horrible job defending himself, just digging himself deeper holes he has to get out of. Calling the claims “unsubstantiated revenge porn” doesn’t help his case. “Unsubstantiated” meaning “without evidence or substance.” Calling it revenge porn though almost sounds like he finds the situation funny.
yea no people do send videos and audios of them moaning a lot. im in a discord server and someone made an entire CATEGORY for it and its one of the more popular ones 😨😨
mister moist you are officially my buffer between not giving a sh about something and looking it up in wikipedia
Dream is Jake paul and Logan paul of Minecraft
Charlie needs to stop signal boosting bullshit accusations. I thought you would've learn your lesson with the pro jared incident, but i guess not.   I honestly feel bad for dream. The hate against him has been so strong for years, that his anti-fans will literally take any and every opportunity to attempt to ruin his life. These "grooming" accusations are just another example. In what world is a 19-20 year old being involed with a 17 year old "pedophilic"?   This is all a nothing burger that will be forgotten about in a few weeks when this trendy hate train dies down.
Grab that audio at 6:25 lol
Dreams a filthy dirtbag cheater why are you even attempting to defend him?
Shane dawson was my guess aswell
Its worth noting the slur nicholas says is the F slur , and hes pan, so its entiery in his right to say it
I’m waiting for someone to mute that Snapchat video and overlay Moists moans 😂
How dream went from being my favorite Minecraft YouTuber ( except for technoblade.) to being edp445 2.0, beefing with gumball. and losing all of my respect is just fucking crazy. No other words needed.
I honestly feel bad for Dream. I cant say for certain that he did or didnt do anything, but if he's actually an innocent man, this is insanely tragic. He's weird and does dumb shit, sure, but I dont really think he deserves to be flamed this hard
Idk Dream and idk bout any of this. All I know is that Snapchat has not looked like that in years 😂
so glad you made this video.  i've had friends ask me what i think about the Dream drama and i've told them "I have no idea" then they get mad at me for 'not picking a side, when someone's clearly in the wrong'  i'm not saying that.  i'm saying that i literally have no clue what's going on over there and there's too many people saying too many things for me to even try to untangle the mess.  It's crazy.
remember when the only thing people though dream lied about was his speedrun time 💀
dream did nothing wrong
One thing is for sure, he's just not a great person. This didn't happen to people like Technoblade, for example.
All this because some mf wanted to get out of his stupid mask
Detective charlie on the rescue!
Im sorry yall but everything gumballs voice actor said was not the "roast" yall think it was. Homie was half illiterate and just spewing shit out of his ass and so many people are like "ahhh boom roasted ahhh he flamed him" Uhhh. No. No he didnt. He was literally just saying shit to say shit and throwing poorly constructed insults and profanity and yall are hyping him up. Its embarassing tbh. Dream also needs to get his shit together and stop interacting w minors. They're both dumb imo 🤷
I think a lot of you don’t know or don’t remember when dream was swatted, the FBI investigated him. His phone was run through and if any of this was found on his phone or his Snapchat data, he would have been arrested. Y’all really just don’t want him to be innocent so bad.
I can’t wait for his video to come out and all these comments to be proven wrong. Y’all are weird. Actually Charlie, a significant amount of his fans are older. Y’all just want him to have young fans and him to be weird so bad. Ew.
what thirst traps 😭
Never double clicked my screen quicker to skip 10 seconds then I did when the moaning played 😭😂
dream admitted in his post that he considered those moaning videos "revenge porn". he didnt deny that he sent them or that it wasnt him in the video, either way - if the person was a minor or not he was sexting his fan which is really weird.
Now I know sand exists. 8:52
Isnt Dream the one who did the stupid face reveal?
It's beyond insane that Dream wouldn't be in this situation if he simply knew how to shut his giant chin
the problem with these youtubers is that they're too open with their community sometimes just dont for explample the vanoss crew they still still say edgy stuff yet not once do they get cancelled
Omfg I threw my headphones off onto the floor around 4:00 I did not expect to actually hear it
I don’t understand why he stopped doing the Minecraft manhunts. those vids were so good and were insanely viral too
I send so many moans
man ppl can literally say anything over the internet and some ppl are gonna agree wit them.
more drawings ✅ more frames ✅ more rule 34 ✅
Bro how hard it is not to be weird with kids, I swear one in 3 youtubers ends up being a groomer or worse.
I do not tend to follow Dream at all but typically when we have this "Michael Jackson-esque" issue going down with celebrities or such where everything seems unfounded it usually leads back to the person having said something antisemetic or tried to expose a high ranking Jew.  Not saying it's the case but if the shoe fits.
Dream has to realize that because of his audience he can’t do what he wants at all
Dream really tried to say ‘he asked us to record’ for someone drunk… shouldn’t be surprised he doesn’t know how consent works.   For anyone in need of a refresher, you can’t consent drunk. The bare minimum is to get in contact with the guy afterwards and say “hey, you asked me to record last night while you were drunk and I did, do you want me to delete it now you’re sober?” Better yet, just don’t record someone drunk out of their mind.
Upset that someone posted a video attempting to expose him. Posts a video attempting to expose someone else. I cant feel sorry for this hypocrite
ignore my comment 5:10
This is so good, all the stupid dream fans, the dreamsexual, fanfics, shipping. It's gonna end finally, that's what they get for trusting a minecrafter who never even revealed his face
I remember when one of the group say " because on our group is less pedofile" thats the real question. 😂😂
Not gonna lie, really wish I didn't hear that audio of dream moaning  :)    *walks off cliff*
if i speak on gumball
dream the type of guy to save a kidnapped woman and get arrested
the out of context charlie clips are boutta go crazy
I feel like he wouldn’t be so made fun of if he did a face reveal much earlier. He’s waited too long, and people expected him to look disgusting. Now he’s hated in general.
that twitter DM one has to be fake recording a screen is the best know what to cover up a really bad fake.
I've heard snippets and I also have no idea what is going on. I also like dream stuff but I never Interacted with dream directly it was more through techno blade. So I'm less familiar with him now that connection is a severed.
Warning sign please
the whole "dream groomed me" coming from 5 thousand people is so fake and fucked up like i dont like dream but thats not right.. people see 1 allegation that hes a pedo and just run with it bc they dont like him. my god
Dream confirmed the audio was him in a private tweet
I'm on neither side tbh
This fight is straight out of Multiversus
L or W Dream rizz?
Trial by twitter is horrifying
Well If I just looked at him not knowing who he is I would assume hes a pedophile aswell, like that bro from shrek
Can we REALLY be surprised when a Minecraft Youtuber is outted as a pdf.file?
6:00 my senior 16 yr sent an audio of him beat boxing and moaning to a 13 year old
Nice cat
Should’ve kept the mask on
A DUDE PASSED A KIDNEY STONE WHILE CUMMING ON VIDEO????
that moan video sounds nothing like him, it sounds like a 13 year old which would make a lot of sense.
why was moisty man being so vocal today for
im confused, your confused, hell, i think the whole internet is like "wtf is this what is going on?!"
Poor guy just don't know how to be famous or control fame. It's just sad how he used to be my #1 youtuber and I always watch his stuff everytime I eat my dinner
i get that dream might be a pedo and some people might not like him but you still just cant beat up people randomly. Thats called assault
6:23
charlie unknowingly saving dream from suicide isn’t something i thought I’d hear or see.
I can't believe rlly think the voice actor is 100% innocent The shit he said... I can't believe he'll get out of this with no consequences He was ableist, racist, and offensive. What the fuck. Edit: Also, I always knew Dream was a  problematic mf. It's great people are seeing it now.
The part where he reads the things the snapchat read made me laugh
Im siding with the Uber Drive in this situation and Gumball is not Michaelangelo. This video shows how inappropriate Nicholas' behavior was. Dream did the right thing by recording this encounter because there is no defense against crazy. We all have heard of the Disney effect turning kid stars into alcoholics, but thats just the influence of endless money in the hands of a kid. Gumball is high on his own wealth and he's acting the way an entitled and spoiled rich kid would. There is nothing redeeming about Nicholas in this video, and Dream is most certainly the victim in this interaction. Being cross faded is fun and not once have I ever acted like this.
In the Dream vs Gumball's VA (will just call him gumball) thing there was nobody in the right. However, Dream publicized the video of a minor in a bipolar episode, while drunk. He made that video get out there. He thinks his fans love him so much they'll attack Gumball. Yes, Gumball was drunk (and a minor), and it wasn't Dream's responsibility to stop him from doing that, but he publicized the video of him during an episode. Sure, he was being threatened, but he was highly drunk. It's not something you should do. Gumball CAN say the f slur too. He's pansexual. Yes, it'd be better if he didn't, but he was drunk. Nobody was in the true "right."
I can tell you I've been sent moaning videos by random men before more common than you think
the way i shouted when the moaning came on😭😭
was not ready for 5:10...was wearing headphones too
Dream's presence on the Internet has to be the weirdest thing I have ever seen in years. Dude was the shit for about a few weeks, and then he just attracted the most brutal hate for the rest of his career. There is absolutely no way he can win  Edit: Fucking jinxed it TL;DR: Quit dogpiling on this dude
minecraft youtubers try not be a predator challenge(impossible)
Isn’t this odd though, the moment gumball and dream fight started to gain popularity, other people started to post leaks of him moaning and saying weird stuff to minors on Snapchat. Like it’s a coincidence that that the leaks emerged while dream was getting attacked. Like when dream was already getting so much backlash other people just leaked the vids and pics making him get more hate. I’m not a fan of dream but like that’s odd. If dream talked with the minors before the gumball vs dream incident, that would be different. But the fact that the pics/ videos got leaked in the middle of the controversy is weird to me
People are saying that him calling it "Revenge porn" rather than just saying "It wasn't me" is damning evidence of his guilt, but it could also be bad wording, which I'm lead to believe Dream does a lot. Either way, his reactions to all of this isn't helping his case.
Him making a video wont clear anything up, even thought it is probably true, he is just going to deny everything like usual
Honestly i dont care what people accuse him of, he is a goat of minecraft and a G in my eyes.
i cant hear dreams moaning without thinking of that damn soundcloud remix including his moan😭
wtf has society come to. people are so stupid. why do yall even care? ok bros weird and probably a pedo. but why do u care. what are u gonna do. yall some superheroes or something for just causing chaos? im sure you all have been wrongly accused of things  or rumors spread about yourself. jeez ill never understand why people cant mind there own busyness. its all fun and games till something actually happens. man just get a life and grow up. 😃   in like 10 years youll forget about all. -nokori shigure
I just heard Charlie moan.
i think it’s extremely telling that he always goes to great lengths to prove he’s innocent/in the right, even at the slightest controversy. narcissists will almost NEVER admit they are wrong, so the way he responded to the moaning video stuff by saying it was ‘revenge porn’ kind of seals the nail in the coffin for me. he didn’t say it wasn’t him, he just attempted to justify the action instead… which makes me think that those allegations are real.
Why was dream even with gumball thats so random 😭
it's so funny seeing people writing snd making videos saying like: "Dream vs Gumball Watterson, like it's the real gumball and not just his VA lmao
convenient not going into the gumball voice actor stuff...
@SunnyV2     Next content for "Fallen YouTubers"
Luv yr dog how cute
charlie moaning was so what i needed today
Imo accusations should be proven beyond reasonable doubt.
It would be great if more people thought critically about stuff that they see online like Charlie does here, most people just believe what they read and see at first glance when alot of the times, it's not true
Wow, yet another streamer with a masked persona turns out to be a pedo, big surprise there boys.  It's time to take them down from the inside. Anybody have any tips?
I dont like dream any more than a lot of fucking people in the comments here, but ive gotta say seeing people defend gumballs VA here purely because its dream on the recieving end of things is gross. It's literally just "I'm ok with slurs and antisemitic shit if theyre directed at someone i dont like" and thats really fucking revealing
Dream vs Gumball is not something I ever expected to hear in my life
Man gumball is a really good cartoon. I still watch it when my kids demand the TV and I don’t want to watch something stupid.
they do send moaning videos, men and women. it's disgusting
Yeah guys don’t even moan. So idk who would do that.
Bro if dream decides to go after Charlie next I swear bro 💀 He definitely looking for fights to stay relevant.
We allready know the best way to avoid this is to not get involved
get him off the damn internet already ffs
6:06 you’d be surprised how many dawg 💀💀
Wasn't Cantu a minor in that video? so he recorded a drunken & high minor saying some some bullshit in a manic state, kept it for months and then posted it when the pedo allegations where getting a lot of traction
idc what he says dawg his rebuttal was one of the most incriminating things
I see that more as a Shane Dawson moan 💀💀💀
to be fair, nicholas cantu is queer and i'm pretty sure he only used queer slurs, but I could be mistaken
Child: IM A MINOR IM A MINOR Dream: You think I care I record minecraft videos
Josh giddey and then dream? 2 pedos in one week is crazy
Average Minecraft YouTuber nowadays
dream is definitely a predator
dream himself confirmed he talked to a minor although he said he “didn’t talk to her in a sexual manner” doesn’t matter sexual or not its fucking weird and disgusting to talk to a minor especially ur fan who would do anything to talk to so it would be an easier grooming situation
I replayed 0:00 so many times, the dog raising his years is just too cute
Minecraft youtubers trying not to message children challenge (IMPOSSIBLE!!!) (GONE WRONG) (GONE ???SE%%%UAL)
Came here for Dream Drama, stayed because of Charlie moaning XD
Dream had an easier time doing the get into a controversy speedrun than any of his Minecraft runs
Honestly can’t believe the hypocrisy from moistcritikal.         He says dream always posts thirst traps when he’s a walking thirst trap 😂😂😂
W gumball
Aren't there new allegations against Dream that he jerked off to a Technoblade cosplayer?
He went from being in a Mr.beast video to having heat with a cartoon character to becoming EDP☠️.
it seems really weird for dream to bring up his allegations in response to getting attacked by someone. it really just seems like he's just trying to deflect
to be fair to the Gumball guy (and not knowing the full context), i was once very crossfaded and i was told it was a weed vape but apparently it was synthetic. (so essentially i was drugged b/c i was lied to about what it was but y'know.)  i was RANTING about how much "smarter" i was than everyone and also that only i was real and that they were aliens. super cringe shit and even some stuff my friends refuse to tell me i said b/c it's too embarrassing apparently lol. so while i think there's an argument that, if you say slurs in that state, it means that's what you're really thinking about, i think there's also an argument that you are NOOOOT yourself in that state.  literally i just felt freaking insane, like a million years passed during that time. it's not the same as having a few beers and then slapping your wife or husband around and claiming you weren't in control of yourself. being blitzed af especially if you aren't used to it can be an absolutely unholy experience.
I read another allegation that Gumball is angry because Dream started sucking his c*ck at the party but didnt let him finish, because the uber arrived. And Gumball was blaming Dream because he called an Uber too early. Is this really true? If so, then it is Dream's fault.
"Are you feeling it now babe, you like that one?"😂🤣
ha Dream more like Cream.
6:18 you’ll be surprised what guys send,  this situation is getting out of hand
People will just hate to anyone that got popular by living their own dream lmao Pun non intended
8:59 yes I believe there is a lot of proof about the existence of sand
Another classic move being played here when being accused of something is the "actually its ME who is the victim"
me when i thought dream was bad for cheating his speedruns:
lets be real, cantu aint catch shit
Although I don't really like Dream the guy just cant seem to catch a brake especially with the whole gumball situation bro literally assaulted him verbally and physically and the internet said nah Dream you guilty as hell
Idk what's crazier, the fact that Dream would record someone drunk saying nasty shit just as dirt that he'd keep in his back pocket, or that he thought revealing that he did so would be a good look 4 him
He’s gonna be celebrating Thanksgiving and Christmas in Prison
when something about forsen
It’s at times like this I honestly wish we still had Technoblade… seriously, ever since his passing I’ve just completely drifted away from the Minecraft communities bc it’s dominated by this green egomaniac.
charlie moaning is the funniest shit i have ever heard 6:18
I’ve been waiting for this video
Minecraft stans were ruining twitter long before elon lol
Dream really thought the best way to beat groomer allegations would be to get someone under the legal drinking age drunk and film them without consent while they were having a manic episode
Dream's down fall is coming
This man cannot stay out of controversy
Minecraft youtubers after hitting 1 million subs 🗿
A guy did what while passing a kidney stone???
I used to watch dream in 2020 and I don’t anymore tbh I wouldn’t find it surprising if he actually did all this stuff but tbh I don’t really know what to believe at this point
He did it!
As a youtuber and streamer named screenments said something along the lines in one of his streams “Once youtubers reach like 100k, especially the minecraft ones, they’re like ‘I MUST TOUCH KIDDS!!!’”. sums up the whole situation
Dream didn’t record that video btw.
The answer is really simple: does he have any legal charges against him? If the answer is no, he is innocent. If the answer is yes, he is innocent, until proven guilty. This is a non-story.
all i know is that he was grooming a minor
I didn't realize gumball is a piece of shit😂🤦
Pedophiles are people attracted to PREPUBESCENT CHILDREN, aka 11 and below. Y’all just throw these serious accusations around to sound important, but it’s wrong and offensive to actual victims of pedophelia.
Kinda sounds like Tommy Innit, lol.
you;re a bad youtuber
This is the only news out there that you can trust in respects to famous people of social media
Is anyone really thankful for twitter?
Ive said this before and ill say it again. It was a red flag when his mask looked like Cryoatics
if he says the something situation is crazy one more god damn time i’m gonna lose my mind😂
gumball roasted and fought dream. this is our timeline.
We need a dream lore video so all the things he wrote on twitter is connected in one video.
Big up Gumball
it su ks vos there are very serious accusations but people fill it with fake stuff
People seem to be misunderstanding. Yes, the unsubstantiated part of dream’s ‘unsubstantiated revenge porn’ statement means it’s unconfirmed if it is authentic. But, if this was thrown against you, would you deny the claims, or call it _REVENGE PORN???_ he’s dug his own grave here. Why would you not flat out refuse it, and THEN call it a targeted attack against your character or something?
6:22 Off-Brand voice actors on take 99,9 be like:  btw, unironically the memes are less confusing than the threads themselves xD
I'm pretty thoroughly convinced that Dream isn't a pedophile. The evidence given is not even remotely solid enough to prove it one way or the other. If more information comes out and reveals otherwise, that's different. But as of right now I feel like it's acting in bad faith to call someone a pedophile with such shoddy evidence.
6:02 They do and boi, it's like next level sexting
5:35 And let's not forget "Tear me to dust and snort me up"
Didn't expect to hear Charlie outright mimic Dream's iconic mating call
i dont care about the dream situation, im just admiring the gamersupps case in the background
It's been a while since I've laughed this hard watching a Charlie video.
I think people are actually into the moaning thing, this girl on Z once messaged me and sent multiple audio recordings of her clearly pleasing herself and moaning. She said she liked when someone listens. I told her I was asexual so I'm not really the right person for that so she said "Oh" Then never messaged me again XD
i miss the person i was before hearing dream moan
People just hate him cause he's weird and it's odd cause all the evidence is like a wet piece of paper atm
“jimmeney christmas, let me tell you sports fans” charlie man you are to funny bro
There ain't no way that moaning video is Dream, would someone with that many followers really send something like that? Seriously doubt it. He doesn't strike me as an idiot.
MiniLad 2, electric boogaloo
dream just can’t not be arguing with someone
not even a minute in: "i'll tell you what he isn't thankful for: twitter"... wait so he's a normal functioning human? Is anyone that's not a bot thankful for twitter?
even is it
we got penguinz0 sex noises before GTA 6
Just seeing the thumbnail is my biggest reason on why I don’t want to be famous. Get blamed for some random shit you didnt do and you get cancelled
Never knew this happend and don't care
imagine being so unlikable that the guy calling you slurs ends up being the one who's celebrated
Gumball Waterson vs dream was wild (I STAND BEHIND GUMBALL WATERSON ✊)
This really gives me flashbacks to the technoblade drama and Jesus, I feel like those toxic dream fanboys who were apart of it need to open their eyes to know what person they are following
I fell bad to dream  : '
Its actually common for guys to send videos like that Charlie
charlie gettin twitter users in his comments ☠️
Dream just will not take the L on this. I didn't even know much about Dream or Gumball VA guy but that kid's rant roasting Dream was fucking hilarious.
6:18  Geez Charlie ̶m̶̶y̶  peoples girlfriends watch your channel!
“As a prior victim of physical assault” bro you got slapped stopped grouping yourself in with people that have seriously been assaulted, I mean Jesus.
Pretty fucked up lookin dog in the intro there 😂
Wild that the internet see's a dude doing and saying the shit that gumball's VA did and just decides "yea but fuck that other dude tbh". Like, I don't like dream at all, I think he's a piece of shit, but he can be a piece of shit and still be in the right about the fucking idiot spouting off slurs and anti-Semitic nonsense
Lord farquad back at it again drinking with minors
The people making fake allegations are essentially aiding him by obscuring whatever it is he's guilty of. I trust you to update us on the facts that come to light
Suiting up for this downfall. I've been waiting for years.
Minecrafter avoid the allegations challenge (impossible)
I love the geometry dash editor triggers as the section titles
That’s what the mask is for to hide the pedophile
Trust in God, and God alone✝️
We got Charles whimper audio before GTA 6 💀💀💀
Nothing To Do With Dream I Actually Dont Even Like Him Especially After Being A Pedophile But Isn't Every Minecraft YouTuber's Content For Children? Weak Statement
Poor Charlie is gonna get clipped so hard for that moaning bit at 6:19 😂😂😂😂
Filming someone having an episode and posting it is insane.
he was grooming kids? what??? are you serious?????? nah man, that'scrazy! it's like the rumor of Snoop Dogg doing drugs was real! which it OBVIOUSLY is not!  Edit: oh fuck, i just saw that someone else made the same joke 3 days ahead of mine. sorry!
Extreme moisty W
my friend turned 18 the other day and immediately was like  “omg im immune to dream now !! “ 😭 😭
I dont like dream one bit, but at the same time nicholas cantu's egotistical self absorbed vent rant is just pathetic. I dont really get why people are fully just siding with nicholas cantu. Both are trash, which is worse? That's up for debate. I really dont care for both.
nobody cares
Dream should have never became "famous", because one, he didn't do anything special than run fast in Minecraft, and two he doesn't know how to handle being famous lmao
3:46 yo, i almost spat out my baked potato man, wtf😭
Has no one learned ANYTHING since Cryaotic?
I see that there are only 2 sides of this drama: 1. Dream is a pedo 2. Dream isn't a pedo  I'd like to say that both are fair, but all of you are too simple. You conclude too fast, you care too much and a lot of this is because of stereotyping and hatred, or d riding. (Applies for both Charlie and Dream).  Anyways, do as you will. May God bless you.
Happy late Thanksgiving
🧔🏻‍♀️
the whole nick cantu and dream situation happened cus dream called a girl a wh****re
Dream has been exposed lol
I'm sure Dream's response video isn't going to blatantly lie to everyone's faces like he did with his Minecraft speedrun cheating allegations video.
He's only good at manhunt all cause he's doing it with "friends" that downright suck at PVP most of the time. In a 5 v 1 suitation, one can just punch dream while two close in with axes, and with how damage works, it's an effective one shot if both axes score a crit one on top of the other due to the fist being less damage than the stone axe.  His content would be more believable and more entertaining had he not chose the same 5 manhunters again and again.  Plus the cheating allegations and everything else giving rise to fake speedrunners, cranking the BS up to 11.
At this point I'm pondering whether dream or sssniperwolf is more mature than the other
Dream has always made me irrationally angry and the sense of Schadenfreude I am experiencing is immaculate
gumball scored a big W with this one.
I hate how so many people want to believe that the Gumball voice actor is completely in the right just because his insults were witty or funny or whatever. Just goes to show that people these days don't care if you're an arrogant narcissistic douchebag, as long as you're funny. Such a sad world we live in. Not saying dream was in the right, but I certainly don't think the gumball va is either. Like at all. I dont give a shi if he he's bipolar that's no excuse whatsoever.
Their age difference is literally an 8th grader and a high school senior having beef. So fucking weird
DAMN
Ooooooh boy this is gonna be a good one
I’ll be honest, I’ve watched the dream smp  before. Never liked Dream. I was in it for the other streamers who I personally enjoyed a lot more. I don’t know why but it gave me strange feelings when watching his videos, almost like the humor was forced and was a bit creepy.  Do I think all these allegations are true? Absolutely not. Do I think some of them could be true? Possibly. Do we have enough information to deem Dream is an actual pedophile? In my opinion, no. I don’t like jumping to conclusions and that’s helped me a lot through life. I do believe Dream can be a bit full of himself at times, but I haven’t seen much hinting towards…this alleged side of him. (Not saying that side can’t exist.) I would need a lot more concrete evidence to figure it out. I used to be subscribed to him though never watched any of his videos. (I guess younger me just thought I should because he was the owner of the smp.) and I have since unsubscribed until I know more since I do not want to be subscribed to a potential pedophile. I would suggest others who may be in a similar situation and don’t know who to believe or wether they have enough information, do the same.  Alright, now for the Gumball vs Dream stuff. In my opinion, I find the fact people are rallying against Dream in this one to be a bit confusing. I mean, I get it. He isn’t very liked for being a potential pedophile but if the voice actor allegedly smacked him in the face, and he recorded him saying slurs towards him, that doesn’t sound much like a weapon that sounds like recording a bit of abuse. It doesn’t matter if you’re drunk, with that logic if a drunk person murdered someone it would be fine. No, you can not and should not be saying verbal and possible physical abuse in an Uber because you’re a bit drunk. (Or possibly high I’ll be honest.) This one kind of seemed like twitter doing what twitter does and  grasping on straws to hate Dream (in my opinion.) And that’s it.
It's baffling Dream even has a following after all the things he's done, but hey the internet's gonna internet I guess
average minecraft youtuber
Respond To Max
Dream vs gumball watterson
Is this eren Yeager’s official YouTube channel?
Stopped to video to find out WTF did he do to his cat?!???
yay
6:00 the absurdity of that is what makes me think this is real.
4:08 I'm gonna preface this by saying I'm on the side of justice. If it can be proved that it happened, then I'm with the accusers. Otherwise I'd prefer to err on the side of caution until they can be proven with verified evidence. Anyhow. One thing we have to be careful of, with videos especially, is Deepfakes and things like AI voices. It is so easy to fake things these days that it's kind of terrifying. *_If,_* and that's a big if, this can be proven to be real, then it is damning evidence. But as it is, there is, like Critical said, no direct proof that it is as of this moment. Heck the videos don't even show the profile being selected via a finger press. That aside, *_all_* accusations and evidence should be held to the highest bar of scrutiny. We should be verifying all claims before casting judgment regardless of who the accuser is, who the accusee is, or what the accusation is. "Innocent until proven guilty" is a tenet that a lot of people seem to have forgotten.
All those dream memes of him being a werido when he first showed his face aged like fine wine 😂
Dream did WHAT!?
Charlie,” I’m going to celebrate Thanksgiving like our Forefathers intended” Me, “Broke & Hungry?”
Man this comment section is a warzone
I think Clay is aware that it just fuels the fire, I know how similar such people’s brains work. I’ve watched some of his content a couple years ago before this drama when he speedran and he seems to be well knowledgeable on how to gain popularity amongst the youth.  I believe dream will try his best to keep his name up there, why, I’m not sure. You need to put up a good performance to make people believe you. It could be for the fame, money, attention, but I’m not sure.
Won't lie I wish Dream had better boundaries with the fans he has, I maybe childish when I'm having fun and playing video games hell I'm gonna be showing that side of me when I get the proper equipment to record game plays not just among us. But even then I know where the line is drawn and what not to do, granted my platform is never gonna be towards kids but even then it's disappointing to say the least
I almost wish I was Dream just so I could make a better apology/clarification video than he will make.
He’s honestly so Moist Coded😅😅😅
Guys moaning is cringe. It's not sexy. Maybe in like grunts or heavy petting but full blown moaning is the BIGGEST TURN OFF. PLEASE STOP. You sound like you're imitating NOT JUST PORN, but the GIRLS IN PORN.
Jesus Christ loves you
Oh wow a famous person is cross faded and saying things that someone who is cross faded would say? Time to record
Dream is a predator 💀 hope his career flops
dream should have just never done a face reveal
I CANT BREATHE WHEN YOUR NOT THERE 🔥🔥🔥🗣️
WHY DID U HAVE TO PLAY THE MOANS WHY-
If dream is becoming EDP WHY IS HE STILL ON YOUTUBE
6:18 Charlie's NPC speech in Banjo Kazooie
Gumball  is a goat
There's multiple videos of people proving that Dream has a second snapchat that he has been inappropriate with minors on. He admitted to this video being him. Not sure how you're still skeptical? I mean, I thought it was just the "oh he has a younger audience so people are calling him that as a joke" but there's actual substance behind the claims.
4:00 jumpscare
you have a cat????
Bro got absolutely clobbered by Gumball watterson 💀💀💀
Ok but like who tf is mad at the gumball voice actor… he’s based as fuck and is a legend for absolutely destroying dream lol
It's so funny that the only reason anyone knows about him at all is that he go caught cheating
this video was very disappointing, there is evidence proving that the dream snapchat is in fact him due to the timelines of other fans messaging him on his so called “private account”. he is a predator. please do more research next time.
He def wish he had a 16 year ols trapped inside of him
At this point I think a time traveler really did step on a butterfly in this timeline
i mean if that is how it is  then it is one of two things   it is either a massive cover up possible or it is all fake by haters or insane dreamers causing stuff that they want or ai either or it is weird crazy because that happens to anyone kinda famous  i dont follow dream his fanbase is insane  but like everyone hates on the dude and builds off him being a narcissist  is it true or just crazy or ill people and those building of the theme and the meme of  youtuber especially Minecraft youtuber = groomer pedo SO  i mean some people seem so sure its true tell me this then why hasnt there been a the law and became a court case  ive seen nothing about that if it is real why hasnt said evidence been given to the legal system instead of being used to shame the guy online and then nothing come of it beside getting more hate and the cycle continuing   like if it is real do something  if its fake stop it  because it is just hate because the dude is weird
when will twitter ever shut the F*** up?   also cross-faded? well that explains alot.
4:03 what 💀💀💀💀💀
Kitty!! Puppy!!
6:22 amazing clip
people are saying dream needs to keep having drama with younger people, but it seems like Charlie can't stay out of drama either. Hes posting more about it and making it a bigger problem.
I noticed you did more research about this than you did before jumping down Pokimanes throat for "expensive" cookies. I wonder why that is. Genuinely. Cause idgaf about the drama but it's just funny to see how you beat around the bush for the entirety of that video with points that are basically moot but when it comes to defending a man who constantly gets involved in dumb internet drama you give actual critical thought.
The words "Dream" and "Thirsttrap" in the same sentence have shattered reality for me because have you seen the dude? Bruh
I support Cantu
We live in a world Were Dream is somehow connected to Cartoon Network. I'm starting to like Thanos now.
I am now an avid supporter of the Amazing World of Gumball.
Nicholas was deadass overtaken by the real Gumball within himself 😂😂
6:19  Thank me later.
All things with evidence considered, dream is just a complete egotistical shithead.
charlie got real nervous when talking about men sending moaning vids
its interesting that Charlie says that it sounds like Shane Dawson considering how similar the two of them look. When the first vocal chord transplant was accomplished, the recipient, while gravely ike RFK Jr. in the early stages of healing, sounded more like the donor. However, as time went on and the vocal chords healed his new voice slowly returned to his original voice. This showed doctors and scientists that its actually the internal shape of your mouth that determines how you sound more than the vocal chords themselves. The fact that Shane Dawson and Dream look so similar kinda leads me to believe that this was in fact Dream's voice being recorded.
6:20 got me riled up for sure. It's winter, but I feel heated.
How is sending a moaning video unbelievable to him when edp sent his shit pics
Why would I trust dreams "I'm not a pedo" if he lied about fucking modding Minecraft
Is there even evidence? Or is it just random bull----
I dont know about dream and all that, but why are minors on snapchat? Why does snapchat even still exist? I thought it died a decade ago
Charlie moaning sounds like my cat trying to spit a furball while simultaneously having an asthmatic attack.
The oddness of seeing only 8 likes when the video was posted 2 days ago is *wild.* surely my YouTube must be glitching? Charlie’s videos get way more traffic than that
It sucks that dream has fallen this hard. I used to watch him a while back before he really blew up and he actually got me back into Minecraft which I haven’t played since I was a little kid. Most of the Minecraft YouTubers have fallen tbh. Minecraft just needs to die before more pesos arrive.
Bajan canadian: "spooky boobs" Jerome asf: "spooky booobs" Skydoesminecraft: SQUID BUTTER. Abuse...... Jinbop: *jail for reason you can look up* Dream: *is the minecraft groomer fan meetup meme but real and actually does all the deplorable and sinful actions even worse than what jinbop did*
I literally thought that was Shane Dawson before Charlie said something. God I hate those guys
I used to try and defend dream like 2 years ago, but now i just can't
Thank god someone knows, I just been getting memes about this
actually sending moaning is commonplace amongst vrchatters as ive enjoyed weed/booze with you there before im completely surprised as to how you think this behavoir is surprising is people wanna hear eachother moan real time they wouldnt be apalled by recordings in the proper context lmao
sounds like what hall monitors on image boards have done to me, while theyre the ones grooming children and its been documented. shit as bad as avatar ripping and alt accounts using past usernames for impersonation which was thankfully debunkable via their own evidence due to imperfect ripping methods.  that being said he technically has a history of inappropriate behavoir and lying about cheating in speedrunning it definitely sounds believable sadly.
I love how the cat smacks the mic with with its tail in the beginning. The sassiness 😂
I didn’t have “Gumball Watterson beats Dream” on my November bingo card.
what the fuck that is the evidence??
the clips from this gonna be crazi
0:02 cat and dog are good friends
WE GOT A CHARLIE MOANING AUDIO🎉
I hate dream honestly, he was sort of enjoyable and funny in the beginning, sadly now he's just yet another toxic person who you would never wish to come by.
I wouldn’t find it hard to believe if the whole video he makes is a lie based on the other video he made addressing a controversy then a few months later going on twitter and being like “oh yeah my bad I actually DID do the cheating at speedrunning lol” and basically no one cared or acknowledged it cuz he already addressed his main audience with “proof”
This probably wasn't on anyones bingo cards
Maybe we will finally get to the "fall of dream" that should have happened when he came on the scene.(yes I do hate him)
there we fcking go. if you say that a lame ahh video that doesn't prove anything is insufficient on twitter, you get called a boot-licker. whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty? dream is a narcissistic scumbag, but that doesn't mean people just get to take every accusation at face value. i'll take this shite seriously when it looks serious
What is it with people just dedicating their lives to driving Dream insane?
he should've kept that mask on...
The fate of all minecraft youtubers apparently
Omg why would you say that whole thing 😂 there’s def a section of TikTok that will be using that for edits lmfao
trying to follow all the allegations is confusing as fuck😭 i don't even know what's going on but since he revealed his face his life has gone to shit
Dream is a grown man who wants to be stuck in a child’s body
I like your dog!
It was about time for Dream’s downfall. He was trash from the beginning.
Charlie how do you constantly make 6k every other day by just commenting on twitter drama? No hate form me! I would love to be mentored on how you do it!
W gumball
Charlie just babbles about nothing anymore 😞
W
Dream moaning 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
im collecting charlies moans
I was today years old when i found out charlie has a dog.
6:19
Xqc did say that minecraft community is full of sh heads
Theres dream drama again?
A minecraft youtuber is also a creep ? What has the world gone to ?
JESUS HAS SPOKEN
Why is the internet still surprised 😂 Dream is perpetually 12 years old
6:20 someone is going to take that clip out of context
I guess we know what dreams favorite song is now that girls a miner
bro the first time i saw his face and knowing he have so many children on his snapshot i suspect he was some kind of a pedophile after watching a lot of pedophile getting caught he look exactly like one
Listen Charlie, as much as I agree with you 99% of the time, Nicholas said awful shit yes, but the slurs? He can reclaim the slurs he said as he is bisexual. This is also coming from me as I’m a gay man. We can reclaim the f slur.
I fucking love the fact that everyone is backing up my cat Gumball, he’s clearly not completely in the right, but damn was he funny. But to be honest the real hero is the Uber Driver
Dream literally admitted the snaps are his 😭
Gumball been roasting irl ppl rn 💀
Wasnt callmecarson brutalized for talking to an above age fan sexually? Why are we not holding dream to the same standard?
6:00 unfortunately there are people like this.
0:11 his dog and cat disappeared ( HE ATE THEM)
Man, can dream catch a break. I'm not even a fan or anything it's just that he can't catch a break as he is everywhere on the internet for sneezing or something
🐢 Turtle moans
Why is it always a minecraft youtuber? What the FUCK is happening on minecraft that turns these people into freaks?
i send ppl audios of me moaning :(
He’s still got nearly 32 million subs! Until people unsubscribe he won’t truly learn a lesson.
Gumball funny
Charlie saying that people often tke the allegations at face value and just run along with them because they hate dream is so incredibly spot on and its backed up by all the comments in this video lol
Dream is just so afraid to get cancelled in his cancel culture community that he probably feels as if he is forced to be overly defensive about everything he does
outta context clip incoming 6:20
It reminds me of the situation of another great faceless YouTuber: Cryaotic. He also groomed underage fans, had an affair with his friends girlfriend and harassed friends off of his stream because of his toxic girlfriend (whoch was alis underage). Have you seen Cry's icon? Dream molded his icon after Cry's even if he says he didn't but its pretty obvious.
Man YouTube really needs to rework the Minecraft YouTuber Skill Tree, the only two viable Endgame Skills are Asshole and Child Grooming
00:02 Dream is currently facing numerous accusations and allegations on Twitter. 01:24 Multiple claims and evidence regarding Dream's inappropriate behavior on social media 02:42 Dream's inappropriate online behavior raises concerns and gives credibility to the claims made against him. 04:01 There is no concrete evidence connecting the alleged dream Snapchat account to Dream himself. 06:30 It is difficult to determine what is true and what is false in the Dream controversy. 07:48 Dream captures footage of Nicholas behaving inappropriately towards him. 09:00 Dream is addressing the situation in a comprehensive video
I’m 99% sure there’s no dream stans left
The worst jumpscare isn’t the moaning, it’s the dick pics, I’d rather get the moaning
you can also say how dream released the video of gum ball in response to himself getting cancelled for being a pedo. which doesn’t speak for his character or his case
SHANE DAWSON DID WHAT WITH HIS CAT?
I bet any kind of money he made the accounts himself and fully admitted to what he’s done, then hit the “it was a fake account” so he could deny any of the true allegations as they’ve already been proven to be fake.
The comment section hating on dream is rly funny to me. Like I know bro isnt a great guy and theres a good chance the rumors are true, but its just funny that charlie tried to let people know that we dont know the full story and shouldnt go taking sides or making assumptions that add fuel to the fire and no one learned from that.
Bro this is insane. Dream should be canceled long ago for his cheats in speed runs.
Thing is one of the slurs he said, the f slur, he can reclaim, since he is pansexual, so idk what dream thought he was doing there
Except dream calling the moaning "revenge porn" proves it's him. Plus the account playing it is a minor. Therefore, it was sent to a minor. lol
The fact that Nic was literally drunk and having a manic episode and Dream tried to blackmail him with it
Dude I live in the jungle in Costa RiCa drunk with happy ending massage latinas and somehow end up home wATching this
AHHHH AHHHHH AHHHH
eARTH is flat Reptilians aRE REAL!
I'd like to see Charles here make a video about the huge roblox drama regarding konekokitten.
bro why you actually playing that moaning clip man i almost died of cringe
Charlie’s cat
i lobe u charlie is want u forever and ever nobodys gonna take you away from me.. nbobody
Charles is where i get all my news
Charlie moaning unlocked something deep within me
Charlie’s cat is so pretty and fluffy. Can’t believe she was once a tiny kitten that Charlie held in one hand so stream could see.
to be fair, Nicholas was allowed to say the slurs that he did end up saying. (Hes pansexual and has ADHD) Of course I'm not saying its excusing his behavior and the fact he said it at all, but he was drunk and high. I don't know about the 'Manic Episode' claims, but recording someone who was underage drinking and on drugs and using it as blackmail on fucking twitter isn't right to do.   I also like how Dream, a grown ass man, got his face scrapped up by a guy who wasn't even permitted by law to be drinking and was high. Dream also went on to make false allegations about Nicholas, claiming Nicholas had also said the N word. Theres no proof of this and its's a 'my word against you word' type situation. It's all very dumb. In light of this whole thing,  everyone's blasting out with laser guns their latest fake dream allegation because the internet wants him gone that bad. I don't like dream either but being annoying online is different from making false pedophile claims.
I never knew dream was an issue. All I ever heard about him was he got made fun of when he took his mask off
when did you get a cat and whats its name its so adorable
I think dream confirmed the moaning was him but said it wasn't a minor
Minecraft YouTubers lusting after kids is nothing new.  It's a meme because it happens so often.
The ego on this kid. Really? A modern day Michaelangelo?  The Dream situation just seems to be another bandwagony parade of bullshit where "famous" creators get accused of horrible things. If we learned ANYTHING from the Projared situation, its to wait for receipts before we jump on anyones ass.  That being said, this fucking kid, Gumball (and not even the only Gumball, with his big ass ego) was very much on camera spitting profanity and anti-semitism and we're just gonna let that go because we don't like Dream? Nah. If you're gonna crucify one of them, you can crucify the other, there's plenty of wood.
Dream is a neurodivergent weirdo who literally came up playing a baby game, whose entire identity for years has been a cartoon. Why is anyone surprised when he associates with other children and acts like a child
It’s a nightmare, a nightmare.
Dream has always been a PoS, when he was proven to be a cheat, that really showed how petty and horrible he was.
Holyshit, a cat
PLSSS THE MOANING
6:18 This is going to me memes into oblivion
Report on josh giddy
Controversy? Don’t know which side is real but the defendant has a bad reputation so it probably is?  Dream really be pulling a Micheal Jackson out here huh 💀
Dream can literally make up a shampoo-bottle-in-the-shower level argument and then still fumble the bag
Sounds like Dream should of stayed on his normal pills.
Everyone: Wow Dream is talking to minors? Twitter: yep, did you know Dream has beef with Gumball?
Cant believe this is the guy that named his sword “Penis” in what was at one point a world record speed run
Dream getting mollywopped by Gumball made my whole week
Remember when his only drama was his face reveal showing he looked like a normal person? I guess this is what happens when your audience is 10-15 years old
I can contest as a teen I had multiple smaller YouTubers and band members in their 20’s send videos of them moaning over Snapchat. So I can believe the videos are likely him.   I can’t imagine someone faking it with their own voice and voluntarily humiliating themselves like that.   Dream also called it revenge porn which is a weird thing to say to a fake video
0:33 Honestly who is thankful about that?
dream did admit live on stream that he did, in fact, send a sex mod to a 13 year old. The only allegation he's ever admitted to being true. So to me, that at least warrants him to face consequence of some kind. Yet he never faces any backlash at all because of his crazed fanbase.
When no one takes accusations with a grain of salt. Or, in this case, a bottle of salt.
IO's fur is so long now beautiful baby <3
Low tier god level roasts coming out of Gumballs VA is got to be one of the highlights of the year
Gumball Watterson looks so boinked out of his mind in that clip
before acknowledging any allegations against dream, he never really bothered me. I was never apart of the dsmp fandom and didn’t know much of it. over the years, the one thing I have noticed is that he’s just been digging himself into a bigger whole and just needs to be taken off the internet. I don’t think I’ve ever seen the internet collectively hating someone more.
you know it’s bad when charlie makes a video about you
If Dream was genuinely innocent then he wouldn't feel the need to "defend" himself publicly lol
I see where this is going and I feel like it's going to end in tragedy. I feel Dream is getting closer and closer to ending his life and there is nothing anybody can do at this point. It's pretty tragic.
Am I the only one supporting Gumball here?
The Minecraft community is either with you or they're against you. Reminds me of the Green Goblin quote. "The one thing they love more than a hero is to see a hero fall"
gumball victim
Clip that chatlie moaning😂
I need 5:09 edited to Charlie going Super Saiyan
Bro really thought he could film a 19 year old’s drunk manic episode, saying slurs of communities he’s part of (he’s neurodivergent and he’s queer), and then posted the video a year later as blackmail thinking people would be on his side. Dream really needs to reevaluate his life choices rn if he’s focused on slandering Nicholas Cantu instead of addressing his own grooming allegations
Seems like the dream luck didn't extend to the real life this time
Didn't Dream and Penguinz0 play Among Us together at one point? Dang, how low he's stooped
I get it but that man, yes dream is a grown man, has done so much shit for people to be coming to his defense. Men do send videos, voice notes, whatever, of them being disgusting - a former 14 year old girl (women used to do that too) STOP TRYING TO DEFEND GROWN MAN “DREAM”
Happy Thanksgiving, I wish this kind of people just avoided any kind of clout as good attention
I just think it's really weird that dream is in the situation where he's with someone who is under the drinking age in the first place. Like where did this person get the alcohol and why are you with this drunk person that isn't of age, that's some weirdo stuff
IMO there is one answer to these kinds of accusations.   If they aren’t true of course.   “I categorically deny all of these and demand anyone who is trying to make these false accusations go to the police and file charges so I can defend myself.  Anyone who does that I’ll believe until they’re convicted in court.   As should we all.
People still like Dream? Didn't he cheat at a speedrun once or something? lol
Why does Nicholas Cantu sound like Badger from Breaking Bad?
Didn't know trollface was lil weird with kids
The lil corner in the middle of screen… I can’t unsee now
I did not get into this whole thing until you would post…only news source I listen to
So suddenly it's "How can you prove it was Dream?" yet just a few months ago you guys believed everything about Justin Roiland was legit? Why?
Ive been waiting for jesus to make a video on this
why did u include the sound with the evidence, wtf
Wait um moistcr1tikal doesnt bowblax video show dream basically admitted the moaning video is real?
Dream admitted it was him. He just says it wasn’t sent to a minor. 🤷‍♂️
Man people will do anything to get attention now a days. People are resorting to trying to completely destroy someone’s career for 5 days of fame. Now you can’t build up any fandom because then someone is just gonna try everything they can to destroy your success.
Who saw this coming 😂🙋🏼‍♂️
Dream learned nothing and everything from Cryaotic
PLEASE DON'T MAKE DREAM VERSIONS OF THE NOTIVE MEMES
One time my finger got slammed in my door, and Snapchat was open on my phone. I accidentally held the audio message button and recorded myself whimpering. My best friend got that message and needless to say it did not sound like I was hurt lmao
Its so crazy how he was one of the most well respected minecraft youtubers and now hes just clowned left and right everywhere he goes now
Ok, real question, who the hell is dream
When charlie stared moaning, i expected it to end with him saying "are ya feelin it now, Mr Krabs?"
Unfortunately Dream claimed on twitter that, yes, that video of him moaning WAS him. I can also confirm as a woman that guys will send videos of them doing that shit 😭💀
as someone who has run into dudes that do that, can confirm that eboys send moaning sound clips of themselves all the time and it is CRINGE lmao
I saw on twitter that he visited a fan’s house for thanksgiving.. 🫢 that he has been in touch with since she was 16. yiiiikes…
It seems like everyone that Charlie plays among us with eventually comes out later in a bad light
As someone that has had a manic episode while also drunk, you tend to say a lot of shit that doesn't paint you in the best light, my family stills brings up things that I said during that time. I don't think Nicolas was 100% in the right, but I definitely am on his side because using that video as a way to prove him 'innocent' of being a pedo is definitely a weird thing to do 🤨
Bud should have never taken off the mask
I legitimately think that Dream is what happens when a young man is suddenly given a huge platform and having no idea what to do about it. He has done things that make him seem narcissistic and weird, but I sincerely doubt he is this huge villain and aware of the strangeness of some of his actions.  I've loved his content and it blows to see how many people are against him, but if he would just make videos and stay off of Twitter, he would have WAY LESS problems.  Also, I want to add stuff to the Nicholas Cantu stuff. Dream isn't filming. Someone else in the Uber (who Nicholas asked to start filming) is the one filming. The video resurfaced after Nicholas said Dream was a pedo and Dream clapped back by saying "you assaulted me and hurled slurs" etc. And when people didn't believe him, he posted the video.
When it's muddled and nothing is clear what is the truth. I always choose the funniest option. Kinda like that pro chess player and the butt plug. Did he actually cheat using a butt plug? Probably not and they settled out of court so we won't know. Still not gonna stop me from thinking it.
Thank you for blessing us with the floof today, Charlie
pretty sure I woke up in the wrong timeline
Plausible deniability is the entire point of horrible people doing horrible things. Always be skeptical
Im not surprised Dreams a pedo. There I said it
what a great car
Oh man feels like 2021 reading this title crazy to think dream is the reason I speak english today lol
Good food, good drama, good time
He acts like most Americans do. 10yr -12yr old stuck in a grown mans body
Don't forget innocent until proven guilty.
Who is dream
Charlie moaning before gta 6 💀
Did Charlie get a new dog
Just saying, The idea that Gumball beat up dream and then framed dream for pedophilia, is looking a lot more plausible by the day.
* Pokimane marking up cookies and being rude to a viewer who was there clearly to annoy her * Charlie: "let's destroy her"  * Dream suffering many accusation about grooming * Charlie: "You see, [...]"        PS: this comes from a Charlie fan (mainly Youtube) who is indifferent about anything regarding Pokimane (all interactions with her came from OTV stuff and controvertions).
People like Dream will never not amaze me...he's been put in the most privileged situation imaginable, playing a simple, fun game, and being allowed to rake millions of dollars in while doing so...and instead of investing and building a life around that and being smart about it, he gives in under the pressure and does shit like this...
DREAM NO! THOSE ARE NOT MINERS!
The evidence doesnt even sound real dude like I'm not a dream supporter at all but you can easily fake the "evidence". The evidence did not show the snapchat username to prove it's legit, you can change someones display name very easily on snapchat, the moans sound like a 17 year old pretending to be dream. You can easily change your own bitmoji to copy dream. I'm not sure why people are believing this point blank.
The Chris Chan merge truly happened we witnessed Gumball Watterson call the troll face meme the F slur, and i'm all here for it.
do a video on josh giddy
Im glad moist looked at this from an unbiased view
Thatttt moan 🥴🤣💀
Bro at this point you really just gotta sit down n stay in ur lane yk? Dream buddy take the day off and see a therapist or something
Dream vs gumball was not on my 2023 bingo card
Charlie moaning at 6:19 for anybody wondering
When I get killed on seige I send a 15 second long voice recording of me moaning
Dream is the type of person that still belives "The grieving" episode is real
gumball would easily win
I wanna see dream get smacked by that skinny boy 😂
Tread carefully on this drama stuff charlie, i can almost guarantee people are waiting for you to screw up....
None of this comes anywhere close to "too cringe to be true". Such and worse crap is sent regularly by idiots. You can find such comments on some porn sites, girls get dickpicks in DMs etc.
How did people not know dream was a groomer from ages ago lmao
Dream needs to realize that we honestly don't care
Ew, i didn't want to hear "dream" moan. Yuck 😂😂😂
bro what happened to this dude's channel. you said just about nothing in 10 minutes
gumball is one of the top 5 strongest anime characters
Bro the moaning killed me
Nicholas Cantu is so real for that shit fr. He can reclaim the F slur so good on him.
will he hire a harvard professor tho
I need to cleanse my mind and ears from the amount of moaning in this video
5:02 nothing could have prepared me for this lineup of words 😂
Ya gotta talk about the time Gumballs voice actor said the f-slur to him. Cantu is GONNA get fired with hate.
Bro both of these people are annoying asf
This is what I believe is true. This also does not support any sides, just basing of evidence presented. The voice actor thing is real, like you said but I’m not known with enough information to know who is right or who is wrong. The pedo stuff however is completely bullshit. dream dream? Come on that username screams fake. My guess that’s it’s a dream hater who rode in the “dream is a creep” part to fabricate and push that story. There’s no proof that directly shows that the person in infact dream and not the creator himself. It’s like they say innocent until proven guilty and these videos suck so much because it reduces the validity of actual cases of harassment and it will be much more difficult to prove when this would actually happen.
It's almost like it's all a dream.
Sadly, the more you cover these things, the more incentivized they are to act like this.
It’s great hearing non biased “in a nutshell” case and instead being like Optimus and being biased in saying “yea I believe it is Dream”
So many of Dream's "controversies" could've been solved if he just learned to shut the fuck up for a moment. No one cares enough to read your 10-page essay explanation, Clay
Im outing myself SOO hard but: i recognize the moans. That's a gay audio bottom pornhub account. That video has been up for like ever.
That scream 💀😂
That moan gonna be taken out of context so badly
Those Charlie's moans though. 🥵
We need more people like dream  In our would. He’s a normal nice funny and respectable guy. He just deals with legit 10 year olds that make him look dumb
Hey bro, there's no thank giving in Europe, also aren't you half Asian ? Huh?
Taps is hilariousuusussu
You explain drama that i had never heard of and will keep me up if i don't watch your videos
So Dream posted evidence that he hangs out with people under the legal drinking age and buys them alcohol and then he tries to get his also underage fans to harass said underage people. What a class act
dreams biggest problem is that he keeps responding and antagonizing. He's so narcissistic that when a 15 year old troll on twitter calls him an asshole he has to start a 20 thread argument with them because his ego is so big and large he can't handle someone doing that. Dude just needs to take a step back and stop being chronically online he's just gonna keep embarrassing himself even if he's in the right. With the grooming allegations I honestly have no idea and it seems like every week there's always a new grooming allegation but I will say if any of it is true I won't be surprised especially with how creepy he is with his fans. and his opinions on stan culture. He also has a really big track record of lying and misconstruing situations so I have no reason to believe anything he says on his twitter or his alleged video he's making to go "in depth", lets see if he hired another Harvard astrophysicist to analyze this
Also I think dream supplied nick with alcohol as nick is under 21 (he’s 20)
First I see Donut Daddy and now this? WHY?
just wait till AI video creation can be used as "evidence" or played off as "real footage" to actually ruin a YouTuber or really anyone for that matter.
Bro I saw you at an eoc yesterday 💀
My gf sends me moaning videos and clips...  Were both consenting adults tho
I hope this stuff is true. He needs to go
Came here for the cat, stayed for the dog.
i dont like sand
Nick said what we wanted to say, the queers have given him the pass for the F slur. Amen.
why would you let me have to hear that moaning tho?  Like... I already believed you man..
my god kitty is so big now
So glad i was a technoblade fan instead of a dream fan. He gave me off vibes from the very start.
I feel bad for dreams sister. I hope she doesn’t get affected by all this crap.
This is not a eposide of gumball but it should be a eposide
Dreams whimper audio is him he confirmed this but denied it was sent to minors
SNAPCHAT IS TO BLAME. I genuinely could not care less about Dream. Idk anything about him except he plays a game I dont play. But dear lord this is 100% the fault of snapchat.
The voice actor was recently on kill tony, he's a shit person
1:52 wow, very original  why is everyone being accused of that? you cant just accuse everyone of that single thing, which should be legalized by todays standards
imagine being dream and waking up to this video lmfaooo
lmao this got charlie so flummuxxed and perplexed. i hear it as a fellow southern dude he dont got a goddamn clue. yea theres no telling, this shit is murky
I here for shane dawson catching strays
Twitter needs to be regulated more. A topic of dream showed up on Twitter and let's just say the video clip was the evidence I crossed upon when I didn't want to hear a little kid getting off on a video in the dark.
These fckers perpetuating the stereotype about white men ffs!!!
Dream literally acts like a child, and the way he gets millions of children to support him after this is WILD.
6:18 Clip it. Charlie exposed
Wow. Yet another minecraft youtuber caught being a p3d0. Who's surprised? Not me
Bro became Mr. Crocker at 6:19 😂
Petition to have Charlie's pets make cameos on his videos more often
I always forget that dream exists, and then he gets into drama again and Charlie and (or) other YouTubers make a video about the situation. I am looking forward to forgetting his existence yet again.
"no evidence - it can't be dream". Proceeds to slam Shane Dawson when there was no proof. Sad
Man, maybe the AI in MGS2 had the right idea...
6:18 and put it on 0.5x speed.
Moist Critikal has got a point to be honest.
I think the main reason why everybody is siding with Nicholas here is because of the fact that he was very drunk when saying all of that. Meaning his mind was nowhere near in the right place. It is also pared with the fact the dream is a piece of narcissistic shit.
gumball smoked dream🥱 Smoking that dream pack
wait WHAT? how is Dream not cancelled like Colleen is?? Sending weird moaning clips to minors isnt enough for a YTer to get cancelled?
Man does not bring up Kwite the entire video, there's probably beef there, dunno why.
Dream is like the new James Charles, always getting into drama...
How the Fuq have I not heard of almost anyone Charlie talks about in these types of videos?
What a sped
as a gumball superfan this was unbelievably satisfying
Ah yes when I was young some girl tried to get me to send her pics and videos of me I never did because I always thought that was weird a few years down the road I find out it’s a guy who was pretending to be a girl
6:21 another clip for the Moist Out Of Context
Holy shit. This hit top #25 trending while I'm making this comment.
Dream is genuinely a modern retelling of the boy who cried wolf.    This tsunami of hate is his own doing in the past and now he just reaping it
i just wait for charlie to cover a topic before i look into it
I’m sorry but… I think we all kinda saw this coming once we saw dream becoming big 🫤
All those comments here should make you realize how much damage can Minecraft do to you if overdosed
All of this because he cheated in Minecraft
Mad because the only time I can ever imaging someone sending a video of them moaning is the weird homie on the gc
5:37 that’s getting clipped 😂
I did NOT need to hear dream (allegedly) moaning to a minor via snapchat today.
3:55 Right here, Dream called these videos revenge porn. Based upon that, I'd say that these videos are genuinely him.
I saw people give Dream shit over drinking with a child (apparently you’re a child until 21). As a Brit, this really seems like grasping at anything to lump on to attack the guy. I remember turning 18 and buying my first legal pint from a bar.
I mean we all remember the speedrun allegations right? He pushed his "stans" to attack the managing team, their houses were doxed etc.
6:19 dont judge my relationship bro 😭
"I don't think anyone has ever been so terminaly horny"   I had to experience that... Some random 15 year old girl (for context im 15 as well) sent me a voicechat of her moaning and saying "cum inside me daddy" i never met the girl IRL. i promptly blocked her afterwards
This is the prime example of bad reputation dictating judgments.
Why do we still care?
The second I saw his face I knew he was a creep.
clip it, professor frink sending moaning videos to minors
Its like dream is transitioning from minecraft youtuber to lolcow slowly
i totally understand not liking dream. i used to watch his content and watch the dream smp but i just don’t anymore. i don’t think he’s the best person out there, and i’m also not sure what claims are true and which are not. but i’ve seen plenty of people HOPING that he’s a pedofile just because they want him cancelled. idk, to me that’s so incredibly disgusting, hoping he’s a creep just because you don’t like him?
6:18 moan asmr
cat
Bro tried weaponising his own fanbase of impressionable 13 year olds and it fucking exploded in his face
cat
Dream is the only man who could have evidence of someone shouting slurs at him, yet still be viewed as the bad guy.
I don't like anyone who saves footage of someone else for blackmail or whatever other secret purposes...
Been waiting for this one
maybe that moaning video was made by a pedo who wants to lure kids into his trap pretending to be dream.🧐
I doubt he is actually a pedophile but I still don't like the guy.
All I knew before watching this was that somehow Dream got into a fight with a cartoon cat and was losing.
dream is in drama every 7 months bro
Dream has the most rampant case of Borderline Personality Disorder I’ve ever seen. It’s giving Trisha Paytas. He’s not even that unlikable …. he just cannot walk away when he needs to. Someone take this man to a shrink.
How wild would it be if Dream is recreating what the Cigarette companies did to combat "cigarettes cause cancer"? Flood the market with content so his bad actions don't seem so bad/plausible.
Wow I didn't know Charlie had two dogs
HAPPY THANKSGIVING ❤❤❤❤
charlie doesn’t believe someone so downbad could moan into a video yet EDP445 sent literal shit pics to a child😭😭
When he first did his face reveal, I immediately thought he looked like a school shooter and/or pedophile 😂
Please make sure you do your research so you don’t go around spreading misinformation
Dream cant help but respond to allogations.
Does it matter anymore now that a majority of the human species prefers to live in a fantasy
Cant wait for dream apology video, oh boi
I mean he has his faults. I wouldn't call him a narcissist, but does anyone really deserve this? The gumball thing is a little messed up, but I don't think any of these other claims are really real
What really pisses me off is that the original victim of Dream's grooming to come forward, with actual evidence linking directly to Dream, months & months ago, has been forgotten underneath the pile of "drama" & controversy
He white it make sense  he a p
Sick megalomaniacs who view themselves as some sort of enlightened beings - this donkey even refers to himself as a Michelangelo piece of art - because fame got into their head real bad. All that because they sat in front of a camera and exposed themselves to the public eye, now thinking the world owes them anything. Whether the accusations are true or not, I wouldn't even bat an eye if anything went south for Dream or any other youtube narcissist
These people live for this shit.
Nick Canthu is also pansexual and autistic, he is allowed to use the slurs he said
imagine 6:19 with no context💀
You notice how all this shit started after he face revealed? Makes you wonder if the reason he did that was so he could start talking to his fans like a fuckin weirdo
I dont even like Dream and his content. However, people just irrationally hate dream so much to an insane degree that I don't believe a single bad allegation thrown his way for better or worse. I've just been continously stunlocked by the downward spiral since the reveal of his completely normal average face. Remove all children from social media I suppose.
Dream really made sure he could certify himself as an absolute creep by recording a person who is clearly intoxicated and post it to save his skin. Bro was asking for the hate lmao. Gumball said some fucked shit tho but then again he was drunk.
who t f are dream and goombal?
personally i don’t really think dream posts thirst traps, i haven’t seen any myself. For the Nicholas part, I’ve seen people saying dream was not the one filming as there was others in the car, but thats debatable. I am currently just waiting for the video to come out and hope for the best since i obviously want it to be false, i think its sick seeing people say they want dream to be a groomer. It’s disgusting.
Skip the rambling: 3:40
6:18 part makes my tears drop from wherever it can
See what I don't get about every controversy that arises from the actions of a famous person, is that at some point in their career they probably thought to themselves, "alright here's the game plan: don't mess this up. Play it cool and safe and you won't go down the drain with all the others". Is there a point where their ego gets so big that the thought of losing their fame becomes too baffling to consider, are these "heat of the moment" situations that are blown out of proportion, doe fame attract a certain type of person, or do they become so big that they attract fans whose sole mission in life is to bring public figures down for whatever rationale they're running with?  Especially with this situation because you would half expect a Tiger Woods style story with dozens of women approaching the stage to lay their claim to the can of worms which would be indisputable evidence against him, but the whole thing follows directly after an altercation with a voice actor and all of it is easy to dispute?
Did i seriously just watch a 10 minute video for a moaning clip with a black screen?
i dont like the side part charlie go back please
your eyebrows are very clean. do you get them done?
I’m going to unsubscribe. Youtube is becoming the reason why I stopped watching cable TV.
Bro went from minecraft man hunt to real life man hunt real quick.
So basically a big Nothing Burger
Idrk whats even true or not.
I skipped to highlight with sponsorblock and it was just charlie screaming
Rip headphone users during the cumshot reenactment 😶
Minecraft youtubers never change
bruh Gumball really beaten up Dream  *what in the fuck?*
Apparently dream was not the one recording that video but was next to the person filming it.
Talking 10 minutes about one tweet is crazy, but what's crazier is the lack of research and sharing it to 14 million subscribers, which in turn is basically spreading misinformation. Talking about groomers like it's some drama undermines the seriousness of the situation. You were angrier about some cookies while selling expensive stuff yourself, yet here it's just casual video. So quirky of you
If you think about it, dream is a hero He's keeping the minecraft youtuber tradition going strong
How about…Leave dream alone for once. Sounds good to me.
4:27 actually. He admitted to the audio. He said it wasn't sent to a minor, and that it was "revenge porn" or something.
Hey, at least its not as bad as leaking someones address, arent I right ssnipewolf.
Dookie butt research
Could be ai voiced too cuz that shi get to real
dream is like tall knight but worse
I remember when that cat was the size of a twig and didn't even have an ass hole. Look at hiw floofy and majestic she is now.❤
charlie man, love ya but you really fumbled your research with this one. people aren’t believing victims because “it seems like dream”, people are believing victims because we’ve seen proof dream has himself admitted to. all you do for victims of grooming in this vid is say “well the evidence is there but we can’t believe the victim. i’m sorry, but that sucks man
Dream. Face revailed and went back on it... super weird fanbase of his
Dream
Dream can do literally anything except shutting the fuck up
6:19 *Me immediatetly going to the comments*
Honestly, i don't believe dream could ever do something bad. His RP character is evil, not the actual him. :/
Honestly, Dream vs Gumball sounds like an actual episode
It's crazy obsessed girls who are mad he doesn't talk to them anymore. That's what I've come to. It's ridiculous. He needs to stop talking to fans ENTIRELY, even if over 18. These Minecraft stans are fucking weird, don't leave the house.. They are chronically online freaks so all he can do is just stay tf away from them
I hope you know I’m getting Burger King ads after your videos🤣
as a past fan of dream, that IS his snap account. 💀
yes that was dreams Snapchat, there was proof. His Snapchat shown was in his bio in 2019 and it was the same in the video. proof it was sent to a minor (Jamie) there is a screenshot of Jamie sending the video and photos in 2019 (which is where they got the evidence of him moaning from.) Jamie is now 20 and they were 16-17 during 2019. There is a bunch of proof you clearly didn’t do enough research.
If anyone accused him wrongfully of things he didn’t do, I hope they’ll go to jail. I don’t care whether you’re 10 or twelve, actions have consequences. If your parents couldn’t raise you, it’s on them, people don’t have the bear your stupid children’s action consequences.
6:01 it’s a thing trust
I know this is not the point, but Charles, if you can't see the thought process behind sending someone a video of just moaning when you're horny, can you rationalize the thought process behind unsolicited dick pics? Men really send those expecting that to win a woman over, as if we're going to have it pop up on our screen and be like: "Ah yes, this is a person I want to be around." We receive weird shit from men all the time, this isn't that much weirder.
I can’t wait to watch these 20 years into the future when Charlie is just an online news anchor
Honestly I just watch his videos sometimes and take everything else surrounding him with a grain of salt
⁠my brother is bipolar and has manic episodes, he’s says and does the craziest things sometimes, racist stuff, homophobic stuff, a bunch of conspiracy’s. Funny thing is he’s definitely not racist and he’s gay so I guess he’s got that card
Honesty  I couldn't care about the subject  I would love to see more videos on Charlies cats tho
I enjoy Minecraft unironicly as a 27 yr old, and I used to watch Dreams speed runs and enjoyed them. After the 5th one I dropped off the interest in his content.  Then I found out about the accusations and was  icked out  Then out of nowhere, Gumball Waterson. And he was acting kinda shitty.  Everything is fucking insane.  What the fuck
Bro what is the hate on dream? If dream said this to nick then we would be cancelling dream. Although dream is not a good person, the hate here shouldn’t be justified towards dream. There’s no proof the Snapchat Moaning was dream. Both dream and nick are adults stop acting like just because nick is younger dream is wrong, it doesn’t work like that. TL;DR, for once dream should not get hate, as he was not the one saying all that stuff.
Non american/britisch speaker here. Just a quick question, whats a thirst trap?
been waiting for him to make a video on this for like a week
been waiting for you to speak on this
Erm
Dream is so manipulative and a gaslighting person… I’m so glad I left his fandom lmfao,I’m happy to see his downfall from Gumball W.
"i'm sure you know him" bro who the f is that guy
wait it actually sounds like the gumball actor in the snap video
7:25 of course an idiot like this’d say “e-commerce”  Such a douche magnet course
Bro has no idea ab the nutting videos with sound on meme
There’s no real evidence, but I wouldn’t be surprised if he did touch kids
MOIST CATICAL:  You know what really grinds my gears, when Charlie's headphones get stuck in my tail while I am getting petted.  That's it.  See ya.
I hope someone clips the moan, and the horrible fanfcition caption together lol
coffeezilla documentary on dream is gonna be 🔥
Dream is gonna become a lolcow soon at this rate! 🤣
we love twitter
Ppl sending vids of them moaning to others rly isn’t far fetched I mean come on💀 there’s no telling what the porn addicts do them mfs are crazy
I just want him off the internet. He’s not funny, charming, interesting, etc. He just got viral off of a few minecraft videos as it was peaking and retained a bunch of children viewers that don’t really know any better. Fads should be fads, and I have a feeling he clings onto this shit so badly because he doesn’t have a plan B in life and requires validation 24/7 even if it’s from literal children
Dream might have been smart enough to research and take advantage of internet algorithms to become famous, but he has shown that he’s not smart enough or mature enough to know how to live with fame.
Gumball absolutely cooking Dream is elite tho
Though I may be a Dream hater I can’t say I think that the snaps are him that’s crazy shit😭😭😭
I find Dream very cringy and weird so any Ls he takes I’m all for it’s always a good laugh
Wait, there's a video of a guy cumming while he passes a kidney stone?
charlie really gifted us with both pets today
I think you should take your videos outdoor more but love the channel
Charlie moaning is now engrained in my mind and will be there for the rest of eternity
The weird part is that in Dreams tweet he mentioned "revenge porn", implying it could possibly be real... creepy.
just letting you all know , when he mentioned sending his explicits to a minor and audios and calling it "revenge porn" he literally gave himself away that he did indeed send those audios.
6:00  Charlie you're so innocent...the things my ears have heard.
i totally agree with you, althought when you said it seems like its impossible for a guy to do that? im a guy and i often times go on snapchat... and some of the shit on there is horrific... guys have sent me full on masturbation videos, and one time there was even a video of a girl getting fucked... i didnt even know it, they were sending wholesome pictures and then BOOM they send that shit... and not to mention the many "hello baby girl how are you, id me like to share pictres, send boobies :>" typa shit... i mean god damn its crazy, i dont think its just snap its wayyyyy more than just snap its prolly discord, sometimes twitter, instagram... what else? idk its hard to mention-
🤢 I was listening with AirPods while walking around in the house. My ears feel so raped…
This video is awful. You don't go indepth about the topic at all and some of what you said is blatantly wrong. You should be ashamed for posting this because its clear zero effort was put into this
I called the cops on my friend years ago. Today he plead guilty to shit like this.
Right i always say that don't just to conclusions with out definitive prof. Im the same ways i dont pick sides i get evidence. Could always be fake
at 5:36 could be taken outta context so easily
Dream is creepy
Your vids are too short
Video should be longer
Man Charlie is able to make shit I do not give a fuck about interesting.
Nice pets charlie
The problem with having lied/cheated is that you have nothing to stand on moving forward after it was confirmed to be true. For most people, a lying scumbag will always be a lying scumbag and you just cant trust anything they say. I dont give a rats ass one way or another in regards to Dream (or anyone else for that matter) but a few things I'll say is that 1) He dug his own grave with the whole minecraft speedrun thing, doubling/tripling down made it even worse. 2) He doesnt look that bad IRL, as a matter of fact if I were to swing that way, I'd say hes pretty cute.
Dude said homophobic remarks on his own twitter, so that's all the proof I need that he's cancelled and a shiz person.
Nick Rekieta would be the PERFECT lawyer for you.
in that gumball clip that poor uber driver😭😭😭
whole lotta gaming
6:19
The name of this video was the name now or “Huge Gumball Drama”
As a gay person gumball gets a pass to say what he said lol
Ngl Charles got me going 😳
2:30, wait I’ve like missed a lot of stuff regarding Dream, why do most people think he’s a narcissist now?
Well well well.. Another Minecraft youtuber..
3:33
Back in 2019 dream had a flash sale of "manhunt" tee shirts, which were 30$ and if you bought one you would be entered into a drawing to be a part of a manhunt video. after making a post saying that it might be delayed, he never announced a winner and no one knows if he even got ahold of anyone to try to reach out. IDK if there were any updates about it cuz I was pretty upset, he made a shit ton of money off that.
Charlie’s moan sounded like a confused British man.
On one hand, it’s sad. On the other hand, free entertainment
People are definitely going to make edits out of 6:20 to 6:24
Even if all of this is false I still hate Dream.
Charlie's moan sounds like a Banjo Kazooie character
could've talked about it a bit better and researched more tbf
it grew
There's gotta be something about Minecraft youtubing that turns people crazy, more and more of these freaks keep exposing their true colors
everybody rallying with the voice actor on tiktok literally just cuz he called dream an f-slur in 2023 makes me just not gaf abt any of this dumb drama shit cuz all the ppl criticizing dream are just as bad as ppl
99.99% of people doing social media content are sociopats...
The guy tried defending his innocence on cheating on a game with %100 proof that he did. Can’t imagine he tells the truth with this situation
Dream= 16 year old in a grown man's body. Penguinz0= Grown man in a 16 year old's body.
THANK YOU FOR FINALLY SPEAKING ABOUT THIS omg
Influencers will forever be mid
4:30 “SHANE DID WHAT”
Shane did what?
Gumball for the W
I want to say one thing and this is NOT to defend dream. Dream has ADHD. And at that unmedicated ADHD. As someone who has ADHD and is now medicated again for roughly a year after 19 years of my life without meds (long story short, my mom thought the meds would get me hooked even tho thats impossible for adhd havers and I even flat out forgot for several years that I had ADHD), this stuff can mess with your brain EXTREMELY.  Whats going on right now isnt narcisism. Whats going on right now is basically a drug trip. He gets serotonin from what makes him happy, just that what makes him happy is interacting with his fans in funny and sometimes very odd ways. It comes to the point where his impulsivity takes over more than anything and he ends up doing crap that he really shouldnt. I say this as an ADHD haver who has been very stupid sometimes similar to him. NOT TO THE EXTENT MIND but that is also because I had my mother around who took care of me for the most part. DREAM DOES NOT.  Dream, right now is basically in this state of mind where he feels younger than he is. He feels like a kid so he acts like a kid. No Im not making this crap up. ADHD can seriously mess with your brain if you dont take fricking meds!  So what is this comment about specifically? Mainly countering the accusations of him being narcissistic. Thats it. Thats all there is to it. My problem is not that people think he is that, my problem is that I have been called that as well and only later learned more about adhd where I could counteract it personally. I did stuff just as I wanted cause ADHD made me seek out stuff that would give me that serotonin hit. I ignored friends, got annoyed at their antics even tho they werent what I thought, I would consistently worry about someone not talking to me and bother them so many god damn times cause I felt extremely insecure and so on and so forth. ADHD messes with your brain. A lot of what we do comes over like narcisism but please believe me, it ISNT that.  Fault Dream for what he does, not for what the cause of it is. Cause if you fault him for the cause, you will pull every person with ADHD into the same box without even realizing it.
completely off topic but u should part your hair straight smackdown in the middle
Lesson learned, never do a face reveal.
How is charlie #13 on trending for gaming? this isnt a gaming video?
W Gumball
Even if Dream didnt do it, he still did it.
At this point, I just feel sad for Dream. It honestly feels like he's trapped at this point, and just keeps stumbling for an answer and ends up choosing the wrong one. I'm not the biggest fan of his content,but Jesus Christ watching all this unfold is just sad. I truly hope he finds some way to better himself for the sake of himself.
i hate to say it but its like justin biber hate at my age i think ps i am not a biber fan or hater but it is like that to my eyes
dream vs tall knight battle for the mask and relevancy
This whole situation makes me feel like that fuckin meme with the Neopet bat: "Wow, this place is a freakshow. I don't respect literally any of you people".
dream admitted that the moaning videos were him, and apoolgized for it and said he thought the person was above age. but even taking that into account, you shouldnt be sexting your fans let alone sending whimpering videos to your fanbase.
Ironic his name is dream when he is in fact…not living the dream
You sound like a hoglin from mc lol
wait but oh "It could be fake." My guy literally anytime a minecraft youtuber is made allegations its always fucking true\
A minecraft youtuber being a pedophile? Who would have ever guessed that??!!
Isn’t gumball pansexual?  So he can say it?  And dream is being real fucking weird recording someone’s manic episode, especially since he’s an adult, and they’re the minor that’s drunk.  Dream gotta be an adult and be responsible instead of recording a drunk minor freaking out, and use that video against them
i just love how the osu community just took that long ass dream tweet and making lyrics out of it.
Apple from Apple Tree
God I hope it's another legendary youtuber apology
The amount of dream stans just hate this video
I'm clipping that moan
Idc if this is all lies anyways, it's dreams fault for falling for troll, and writing entire essays over small shit. On top of that, a horrible fan base, horrible music, horrible content, ect. Then pedophilia..
dream showing his face to the net was the worst move on the board lol
Dream already admitted the moan was him and threatend to sue because he thinks its revenge porn
Nicholas Cantu the most corny ass standup ever, he was fucking terrible on Kill Tony
And there are still people defending the guy. It's insane
@6:19 someone gotta clip that and make new allegations lmaooo
Some people just cant grow up
Honestly, I feel like people are just attacking Dream for little reason past personal envy. Like, yeah, Dream's not perfect, but there's only been one perfect man, and he got crucifixed for it.  Really is summed up by Nick whats-his-name, the voice of Gumball, saying he's so much bigger than Dream when the man's only citation is being Gumball. (And also Techno's friend, but I had to look that up to make it was the same guy.)  People just be haters, end of discussion.
Imagine getting beat up by gumball watterson
Man, The Amazing World of Gumball was my favorite childhood TV show. Can't believe that the main voice actor literally got drunk and now my childhood is completely ruined
Who? What? I'm too old for this shit.
This is a blessed day. I saw a human a cat AND a dog!
I’m new to YouTube and post videos on my channel unboxing sports cards packs. A view would mean everything 🥺
Charlie = YouTube TMZ  When you're this famous but don't talk to the people you gossip about yourself..
Damn, the view to like ratio is crazy…
...who?
Apparently if you go frame by frame on that “moaning” audio you can see it’s pretty clearly stitched together from a still photo to a video.  I was as excited as anyone to see Dreams downfall but alas, not today.
charlie really grew on me
i wish i could unhear those snapchat videos
I trust you Charlie as my way to continue to know more about what's happening In the world or at least some of what's happening.
KITTY
Charlie is so brave to actually post the moaning audio 😂 not even oompaville was willing to take that risk
6:19 new banjo kazooie character dropped
FFS PENGUIN😂a WARNING WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE before you played those audios as im fkn listening on my home theater around the house at an unholy volume thanks to this... now i cant leave my house for the next month 😅
so gumball slapped this kid and called him slurs and people are siding with gumball? this world is insane
How can you trust someone who had the ego to challenge technoblade when he isnt a pvp minecraft youtuber. Not saying techno was unbeatable but that he didnt really want to fight but dream was so confident he would win, he peered pressured techno into fighting him. And lost...
NOOOOOO NOT THE AUDIO NOOOOOO
DREAM SAID THE SNAPS WERE REAL‼️‼️‼️
I don't really like Dream, he's a narcissist, a liar to his fans and the speedrunning community, and gaslights pretty much everyone. That being said, 99% of the allegations that are related to grooming don't have a shred of real evidence. It's all just a bunch of 15-16 year olds grinding away at the rumor mill. Because really and truly, if that were the case, and there was proper evidence about it, then the real stuff would be tagged to Dream directly, forcing him to have to respond to it, instead of being on relatively obscure Reddit threads. If the shoe fits, then go for it imo. People have thousands of things they can throw at the man, but if I'm being a buck fifty here, messing with kids is something I just can't see him doing. He's too into himself tbh. Like that man worships himself on a level that can only be described as like the Orange Mussolini does. All of this, the narcissism, the lying, the gaslighting, this is all proven without a doubt, with mountains of evidence.   It's just surprising to me that none of that seemed to matter, until some fool brought in children. Like, what kind of can of worms does this open? Does this now mean any internet personality can just get shut down because a troll on Reddit decided to stir the pot with that kind of allegation? I think that's the scarier part of it.
never trust the pansexuals
bro. If you make over $20/Hr from your HOUSE. and don't have to talk to people about, work duties, scheduling, have your own AD REVENUE. ect. you are 100% a sick individual. rip the band aid off bro, all of em, have at least ONE depraved trait.  Get a job. talk to humans, you're okay, I promise.
Him saying that sending a clip of you moaning to someone , like the whole “men whimpering audio” apocalypse fell on tiktok🤣
this video was lazy af, u talked abt the same fake garbage for like the first 8 mins and like all u said abt the situation w dream and nicolas cantu was that it was real
5:09 I'm sorry what?!?
Car and dog cameo
6:22 is iconic
dildos doughnuts and drama.
Hearing charlie say "your tits are so nice wtf, I just want to fill you up princess" has awakened something inside of me ong
I love the duality of these comments xD More than 80% are just aggressive and or straight up braindead  It is very fun and or frustrating to see this so called „the smartest animal on the planet“ acting this dumb
took ya long enough
Dream touched my older younger brother, for real
I agree that Dream is a narcissist, however I never thought he was like a bad person. I think he’s stupid, arrogant, narcissistic, and over all emotional incompetent. He doesn’t know how to handle drama or negativity and is chronically online. However, I never thought he was malicious. I could be wrong, I could be right. I don’t know. I used to watch him a bit, but haven’t in over like 2 years. I do believe because so many people already dislike him and his fans that people are more likely to blindly believe stuff to taunt Dream, and his fans, with.   After all of this I hope Dream stops being on social media. Not in the “cancel and banish” sense but more of the “this clearly isn’t good for you” way. The man is incapable of handling controversy, criticism and hate
My personal theory is that without an example like Technoblade to temper his steel, Dream went down the dark path of parasocial relationships. Sure he was somewhat parasocial before, but Technoblade wasn’t just another yes man like GeorgeNotFound and Sapnap. Maybe I’m just not getting the picture, and my correlation between the death of Technoblade and Dreams decline in quality is blinding my judgement. Technoblade was almost never parasocial from what I recall, and truly had his own ego in check. Technoblade was never unduly mean or made everything about himself. His content revolved around the actions taking place, and what he did in response. Dream is probably a narcissist, but when those who share a fan base see another’s success, they subconsciously imitate the other person. Idk, I’m just saddened that the old days of Dream are over, Technoblade is long dead, and everything I knew from my 2010s childhood is just a long string of terrible people entertaining children. Thoughts?
The difference between the two people is that we actually like one of them. Dream HELD onto that like blackmail. What a snake. I never liked him. As a gay person, gumball gets a pass lmao
6:19 MOIST WHAT KIND OF FACES ARE THOSE?
Dream should’ve never revealed his face
There’s something suspicious about Io, she may know more than what we might think.
So what I'm hearing is that Let's Players are the new pop punk musicians.
Dream has clearly been deprived of childhood warmth
6:19 You are welcome! The music to my ears!
I always hated dream. It’s good to see him finally get dunked.
This just makes me happy I don’t have Snapchat or Twitter/X.
my main issue with dream was cantu situation, like why was dream drinking with an underage individual (drinking wise), and then recorded that underage individual as he was clearly having a manic episode. what cantu was saying was definitely out of line and wrong but the fact that he was drunk and possibly high with dream while cantu was underage and dream wasnt is very weird to me.
should've just kept the mask on and stayed behind his computer 🤦🏾‍♀️
Um technically it was 638 thousand people voting, because you can get more than one vote from fame ranks, prolly about 100k 🤓👆
but what makes me made about content creaotrs is they always seem to post shit online (becasue it gets money and views and attention for them) but they dont go to the police to keep it private and actaully do something in terms of  justice. its all a content grab wheather its real or fake. why doesnt he go get a lawyer and go to the police and do it behind the scenes? why does it have to be some video talking about it. if it messes you up that bad, go through the proper channels and get him charged. until then i dont really belive anything from anyone
first time ive felt like moist had a bad take.
To be honest, Boblax had such a better take on this situation.
6:00 gen z is fkng insane bro you'd be surprised (yes ppl actually ask for and send moaning audios)
Dream looks like a map supporter
Thank you dream for getting me audio of Charlie moaning 🤤🤤🤤
I don't make opinions on topics like these until a critikal video comes out
hear charlie attempting having orga*m might save it for later purposes 🤫🤫    of course for a meme 😈😈
The problem is that it honestly could be all false. Dreams fanbase consists of at least 90% 13-15 year old girls that are chronically online. It’s a common thing amongst these fanbases that it takes just one person to post a fake claim cause they’re bored and like the catfish typa things, to start this whole thing. And everyone adds to it for the drama. I still don’t like dream but it’s impossible to know if these claims are real or not or to look into it cause as he said you’ll find thousands of similar posts, it’s insane. I would honestly just not look into any of this and save the headache and just ignore dream. From the start his fans have been annoying and the most cringe people. I say this cause I used to somewhat be in that fandom and my timeline was a bit dream based
I don't think Dream did all that JUST BECAUSE a lot of people don't like him. I believe he did that because I'd rather listen to the people who were actually hurt by his actions.  I was unbiased when all this unfolded on Twitter, as I have a really small circle of friends. But after reading through the accounts of the people who were underage at the time they and Dream had certain conversations, I am much more inclined to believe them. Especially when a lot of these accounts of their conversations were swept under the rug due to constant harassment. "Innocent until proven guilty" is a thing, but with how so many people have stood up to share their own experiences with this guy, I feel like there's plenty of proof out there. I'm sure there are many people who feel the same as I do.
W8 you eat sand too? Hell yeah brother
Dont make a vid if ur so confused and misinformed. This was a video full of nothing and is a misuse of ur platform
5:07 Best part of the video
That moaning clip is burned into my mind and i want to die
Same guy who made a whole video with a “Harvard Professor 👨‍🏫” the a week later got exposed for lying
Gumball dropping the J accusation to Dream was priceless, what a time to be alive
Wow dream being a pedo, who could of seen it comming from the man who called his fans kittens 🙃
Its honestly sad that everybody is just saying sht and doesn't wait for evidence that is actually real, to then tell their opinion.
charlie be like "i'm legally required to say that i dont know for sure whether this massive creep is actually a massive creep. but ill be thinking it. boy will i be thinking it"
think its worth to keep in mind that he hired like some quantum mathmatician or something to prove he wasn't cheating in minecraft, then turns out he was cheating. So I simply cannot believe anything dream says
Charlie moaning made my day 100x something. Take that as you will
Minecraft youtubers be normal challenge *IMPOSSIBLE DIFFICULTY*
all the pussys feel sotty for this guy now? we all say "cheaters deserve wahtever they get" and he does if you cheat once no matter in waht game you deserve the karma you reap after that. i stand by those words 0 empathy for such losers.
Digging his own grave at this point, always doubling down in the drama without any like convincing evidence. He should start acting his age tbh
Some important details Charlie left out: Nick is lgbt+ so he can reclaim the f slur he uses in the video (although that doesn’t mean he should weaponize it as an insult), and Nick is under the age of 21, meaning some other adult enabled him to get crossfaded.
I like how Dream pretends he didn’t just try to blackmail someone who was blackout drunk and bipolar having a maniac episode because that actor called Dream a groomer and punched Dream for calling that actor’s friend a whore.
So where sure he didn't sexually assault any minors🙄
Ik dream is regretting that face reveal😭
Honestly, anything I know about any drama in Twitter or YouTube is torough this channel
This video told me nothing. This was a nothing burger, Charles
I had never heard of Dream until his "face reveal" and it feels like his life has just been going downhill since then with all the allegations
5:10 sounds like Charlie powering up.
Damn the trolls are having a field day
No more Normal Pills 😢
theres so many clips that would he horrible out of context
Wasnt it obvious that when he did his face reveal is was just about him getting some easy action.
I've never used Snapchat, it never was a thing in my country, but I'm convinced only creepy and sketchy people use it.
Charlie looks so tired of this Twitter BS. He legit looks like he's about to quit the channel. 😭- Charlie = DramaTheory
I like how everyone sided with Gumball on reflex but if you watch the videos with him he’s a total narcissist POS just as much as dream. Like ok dude youre Michael Angelo because you voiced the funny cartoon cat boy. I swear if you’re famous past a certain level you just go full insano mode
L O L chaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrllliiiieeee i wish u were a girl rn only for the fact that yes guys are gross and do this omfg when u were reading the texts I was like lol like 80% of my interactions on tinder guys can be sooooooo grodi
If he doesn't know the kid why did he get into the Uber with him. He got hit by a kid he didn't know but still got in the car? Like what
Charlie’s moans… sheesh 🥵
6:19 You mean its not normal the moan like that? Doesn't everyone make those sounds? Kind of like you're trying to fight back vomit mid conversation?
I think if you can think it someone has been horny enough to do it and send it to someone else
The only thing I’ve heard of the Dream did okay was that roleplay game. It sounded like a neat online series. However, the only reason I heard of that was because of his cheated speedrun that he got busted for. Every time he’s come up since has been questionable at best. His face reveal floored me because he willing lost his anonymity that protected him from all his bs affecting him in real life. He would be better to go offline and find something new before it’s too late. His social media game is going to ruin his life, and potentially others around him.
people have too much time on their hands to put so much effort into reddit
6:20 PLEASE  DO NOT  EVER  DO THAT AGAIN  O_O
Can’t wait to watch Dream VS Twitter GRAND FINALE REMATCH
Kinda crazy how Nicholas Cantu went to kill tony and he talked exactly like he did on that video
Too many people assume dreams fanbase is all young, simply look up any meet & greet, concert, or in person event he’s held and observe the audience, it’s mostly teens/young adults, mainly ranging from 8 years old to to 30, yes plenty of his supporters are older than him, yes there are also younger ones because he is a minecraft creator, but his demographic is much larger than the majority of people assume
People should stop blaming Dream and pointing guilty fingers at him for no reasons. Y'all need to calm the fvk down.
Honestly, the only reason I believe that he's a pedophile is the fact he admitted, in his Tweet where he's talking about doing a video to refute all the claims, that the thing about him sending moaning videos to minors being released to the public was "revenge porn". Doesn't say they're fake, or that they weren't sent to minors, no he defends himself by saying it was wrong of people to expose that because it was "revenge porn".
Ha ha ha, dream whimpering asmr 10h loop when?
Even if the claims are real, what’s gonna happen? He’s still gonna have a defense force of 14 year old girls, and he’s still gonna be rich and successful. Like I’d like to see consequences, but I just don’t see that happening.
dream really needs to just quit, being a public figure isn't working out for him
I kinda hate that I watched this and now this topic is taking up space in my head.
HEADPHONE WARNING AT 5:15 ⚠️ my right eardrum is bleeding... -_-
Imagine being a multimillionaire with generational wealth caught up in the type of shit. Undeserving
nicolas cantu is pansexual, neurodivergent and autistic -- the slurs he called dream (who is allegedly a groomer) are easily reclaimable, and he has BPD and ADHD and experiencing a manic episode, also underage and allegedly both high and drunk during the recording while underage. nicolas asked to be filmed by dream during his episode apparently, but between a PDF file and gumball, its very clear who most people choose
6:01 i mean edp sent a shit pic that one time and went after another minor after he got caught the first time
Happy thanksgiving charlie
The cringe is real with those moaning sounds
Gumball dude is mad obsessed with himself
Didn't expect to hear Charlie moan lol
Ever since he showed his face, everything went downhill...
You know the guy choosing "dream", if you listen to how he describes himself, he is living a dream. Something else to think about, that weird part in this video where moist decides to imitate moaning sounds. WTF was that? Lol was more like someone having an overload or a bad reaction from something they ate. Lol another worriesome thought, is that how he moans? For real, lol 😮
I don’t care nearly enough to research into the claims being true or false but the one thing i do know for a fact is that he is an absolutely untalented hack of a musician
I knew it was only a matter of time before he reviewed this. Dream just keeps making things more difficult for himself. The way Charlie just talks about these things and still is such an epic person is great. He is just chill like that.
A dude sending moaning videos is wild 😂
I just find it hilarious how a lot of people will go to bat for their favorite creators and defend them tooth and nail when they only know as much about the creator as the creator themselves has let their fans know. Even if you have watched every single solitary piece of content from any creator you still know absolutely nothing about them in their personal lives and we have seen that so much the past few years when we see creators that we thought were wholesome men and women are caught doing shady things behind the scenes weather it's as mundane as faking or splicing runs, to rug pulling scams, all the way to being fucking groomers of children... People need to remember.. you can love a content creator and enjoy their content but just keep in the back of your mind that you do not know this person personally and honesty have no idea what they are truly like when you only see what that creators has cherry picked and posted.
Guys we are talking about a grown man that plays Minecraft and barely leaves his house and exists predominantly online, of course he is probably weird and/or a creep. I don’t trust anyone other than Charlie for the most part when it comes to YouTube content creators. Been genuine since day 1
guy can moan and be hot but dream is not.
Ugh those videos are just straight up weird. Coming from anyone. Gross lol.
Thank you Chuck
ur telling me the dream whimper audios dropped and im not young enough to get them?? >:c
I can find the video of a guy passing a kidney stone while orgasming
AAAAAWWW THE KITTYYYYY HII HIIIII
Bicep
Should've taken his normal pills
Wanted to add: Dream's responses to the allegations made against him do not deny the evidence being real, in fact he somewhat confirms it to be real, just claims it was sent to a different person who has come out and said it was not sent to her and he also claims he didn't groom anyone.  About the Nick Cantu situation, Dream claims that Nick asked to be filmed and the person filming was not Dream but a third party who then provided the video to him to post two months after the incident in response to Nick's public bashing of Dream. This situation does not really mean anything and really just distracts from the real allegations, although it put a spotlight on Dream which allowed the burner account to share their claim, so it did benefit the victims in this way.  The claims from a year ago (Anastasia and Amanda) and the claim from this year (Jaime with support from Nat/Cat and the two owners of the burner) all align, showing the same snapchat accounts and similar ways of being approached and messaged. Even more people have said that they were also in contact with Dream around the same time frames and have confirmed that he was messaging with fans then.  With so many people backing up the validity of the claims being made against him, it makes it very hard to see how it could be fake. Dream fans have tried to debunk evidence and Dream's abusive ex has made this even more complicated by her attempts at lying to make him look even worse, but these are not substantial proof against the original claims nor the burner.  Lastly, Charlie, your video really adds nothing to this situation and I do not understand the point in posting this.
We won today, boys girls and those of unspecified genders, we got primo, high-quality, undoctored, uncut audio of Charlie salivating directly into our ears.  It is truly, the most sex tape of all time.
Wtf is Thanksgiving
listen i'm all in to the video, but damn it i want a turn at the claw machine
I don’t know who these people are and I’m so happy about that.
quick, someone clip the moaning
I keep on seeing people on the internet saying that they "forgive Gumball". I would just like to say: Nicholas Cantu, IS. *NOT*. GUMBALL. Gumball Watterson can be a lovable, cute, funny character, that you love, but that does not mean that you just get to forgive Cantu for being just downright homophobic, and ableist. And keep in mind: I am in NO WAY defending Dream here. I don't have any respect for Dream whatsoever. I just wanted to make it clear that people need to separate the character from the person, and look at it for how it really is
6:19 new ringtone
Someone gotta get Charlie on those whimper audios how does he not know
can someone in the comments explain to me what happened between dream and gumball's va im actually so fucking confused
i’ve been waiting for this vid
I did not need to hear that while eating😭😭
For the groomer allegations, we have those videos of dream on Snapchat so i automatically believe it but even without those videos it’s always believe the victim until proven otherwise.
Review the Josh Giddy allegations
I can't wait for all the drama people gonna fake with Charlies 'moans' now. Can't wait, twitter!
As someone who is bipolar, one of my biggest fears is being recorded during a manic episode, because you cant really control yourself.. and the fact dream recorded him to use the video against him just makes it even worse..
Charlie you're my favorite rational thinker of all time
Bet he regrets showing his face from the day he revealed it to the world.
imagen in 6 months when dream is lying in the bath at midnight admitting to this.
Finally there's a clip of Charlie moaning.
Why couldn't this dude dream just stay good at Minecraft and call it a night bruh
A gumball
gundam exia W
I love Türkiye not turkey Türkiye
I didn't want to hear that today... Thank goodness Charlie's handsome little face was there after those moaning clips to ease the pain.
“who would send a video of them moaning” you wouldn’t even believe….
Charlie's at it again, God bless. 🙌
6:00 You'd be surprised. Please help me.
I like his Minecraft stuff and I have found some great youtubers through him, but the dude has a MASSIVE blinding ego and I remember even 3 years ago he would rage on members of his own SMP when they were literally doing skits
I hate the new members comments section
i love your cat
Dream is in his nightmare arc
Are we talking about Minecraft dream or musician dream
Does anybody else watch all Charlie’s videos and not know who these people are?
We all know Dream is a pedo. That’s true and everyone knows it.
Charlie is like my source of social media news
god critikal so uninformed its almost comical.
I cant even begin to wrap my head around how you are defending Gumball/TMNT kid for being a full blown racist pos.  Whoever "Dream" is doesn't excuse that boys actions.
It's situations like these that are so messy, chaotic and hard to sort through that it reminds you that, hey, maybe you DON'T need to have an opinion on it.
jeepers jinkies
MEOEOMWEMOWEMOWEOMWEOMWEMOWEOMWEMOWEOMWEOMWEOMWEMOWEOMWEMOWEOMWEOMWEOMWEOMWEOMWEMOWEOMWEOMWEOMWEMOWEMOWMOEWMOWMOE  got a new keyboard
I feel like I somehow learned absolutely nothing from this. I still have no idea what's even going on.
Imagine being in the car with a drunken, belligerent 19/20 year old hurling slurs at you and berating the Uber driver and he's still somehow not the worst person in there  Classic Dream
5:59 it's more common for a woman do that than men
all these self appointed heroes on the internet doing gods work.. internet has made many sad pathetic keyboard warriors all pretending when all they want deep down is clout. I don't believe shit unless proven to a reasonable doubt like for example the EDP situation
Actual pedophile. No doubt he has YouTuber immunity and won’t ever see his day in court.
Its a minecraft youtuber know wonder he feels the need to groom
I think dream is still stuck in a teenage mindset due to his massive rise in popularity at a young age. It’s like it’s fucking up his ability to grow and mature like a normal person
Josh giddy situation?
No more moaning for you! 😂
Why is it that Minecraft Youtbers either become - Mediocre Content Creator - Sexual Predator - Both
It just disgusts me that Dream can prove something to be absolutely false yet he would still lose the argument and be hated because he's just "the silly minecraft man". If you don't like Dream then whatever no one cares, just don't keep supporting false allegations just because it goes against him
why haven't you talked about p diddy???
next video - 'jesus situation is crazy'
I have eaten 5 pounds of smoked ham.  (Fuck turkey. Ham FTW.)
The moaning "outrage" is the dumbest shit. There's no proof EITHER WAY. Not who sent it, not who moaned, not who it was sent to, not age of the recipient.  It's clear that there's ton of false accusations, but also impossible to tell if some are real. The worst believable things have been him sending apparently consensual sexual messages as 19-20 year old to 17 year olds. I guess I'm not puritan enough to understand why that's worthy outrage to get tens if not hundreds of millions of views. As it stands, his worst crime to me is being very cringe.
as a minecraft fan ive hated dream for the face he put on my game
It's really disappointing that you chose to make this video and didn't include the full picture to an audience of 14 million people in a situation as serious as grooming.  Dream himself said that the audios were real both on his private and public Twitter accounts. Just that they were sent to an above aged fan.   It's also disappointing that you make the claim that people are choosing to believe these allegations because "it sounds like something dream would do". They believe the allegations because there were previous allegations that came up a YEAR ago that he has not properly responded to and you fail to mention in this video, as well as the victims providing more proof of these claims than Dream does debunking them.  Dream also calls the moaning audios "revenge porn" on the tweet that is IN YOUR THUMBNAIL. I don't know how you miss this, but I find it very irresponsible to post this video without a proper understanding of events. Claiming "none of the proof is concrete" and that the audios "could have been faked" when the person receiving the allegations himself confirm that they are real.  Big fan of you Charlie, but this video should not have been made.
Lol all this for a Minecraft Youtube. Happy Thanksgiving yall
Charlies been getting cooked by H3 lately. Its actually pretty funny the soundbite they use where charlie is losing his shit because the cookies are expensive lol. Relax its a cookie.
you're telling me the guy with shane dawsonface is a creep? wild
Day 9 of eating a slug
god thank you for saying none of the proof is real evidence because i dont like him either, but if someone else was getting accused of this theyd want more evidence of a minor receiving them or it actually being him etc.
Bro doesn’t know about whimper audio
Big dream conspiracy - something in there is true and messed up, so he is muddling the water with as much false stuff as possible, then making a video proving the false ones fake to hide the truth.
clearly you have not heard about e-sex for moaning videos
charlie i have to unfortunately inform that sending loaning videos seem to to be a common occurrence , we had a guy at my school named joe , who was caught sending similar voice messages/ videos .
Who TF cares about Dream? Dudes a Minecraft celebrity who I'm not even sure why anyone wastes their time with, he builds block buildings and runs a cult......oh wait sorry you simps call it an "SMP" 🙄
Even if dream didnt do anything wrong, which im fine believing, im just wondering why hes fighting a war on X, its literally pointless
Wait. Kidney stone orgasm??? I need too see
Charlies room looks like the average "PewDiePie's Tuber Simulator" room when you hit level 45 and im so jealous because of it
The downfall of dream is something I didn’t have on my bingo card tbh
Literally who?
People who film you without consent while you’re under the influence deliberately to use the video to get back at you later probably have their own skeletons they’re trying to hide, just saying.
Twitter <333
22 hours - 2.6M views?  HS
6:14 Charles is underestimating teens. Especially my generation and below
I mean sending an audio file of moaning is weird... but plenty of dudes send unsolicited dick pics all the time so that doesn't  surprise me.
Nobody can honestly say, that as SOON as Dream did the face reveal, you couldnt tell he has got the typical attracted-to-minors pedo face. You could almost bet on it and you would have won bank
If u didnt see this coming then u need a vacation from internet
bro made a video faster than Dream did to defend himself, still waiting on hearing his shitty ass response
Rapheal is post malone
Dream Stans vs Swifties. It seems like a scary issue either way.
"sounds like shane dawson" im screaming
I feel like Dream is the next Wings of Redemption LOLcow.
Kinda off topic but I've received more moaning audios that I'd like in my lifetime. It's definitely true
Nicholas is 20 if im right in America thats below the drinking age so dream mustve supplied alcohol too a minor
Can someone explain me what Charlie meant with "Dream posting thirst traps"? (I know what a thirst trap is)
The moist critical out of context community is going to go crazy on this video
Yk dream confirmed it was him in the video… Right?? I thought you did your research??? 🤨
0:03 hello cat!  0:09 hello dog!
Bro how are people this stupid in there lifes like your so lucky to have a career on youtube and your in everyway possible trying to ruin it
"#1 on Trending for gaming"
From what I can tell from watching dream and the drama that he's been involved in. It's clear that he really is just a gamer that had no idea that he would get this well known. Its clear that he still doesn't understand that what he says and does is being watched by millions outside of his fans. On top of that, because he doesn't know what he's doing in regards to his reputation, he's very quick to be defensive or apologetic in order to save face. Which only ends up making him look arrogant, and guilty as fuck. Don't know if the pedo stuff is true but if it is then he's disgusting as they say.
I think dream is one of those people that can't turn down any sort of attention even if he knows it's wrong. A lot of people may not be looking to get into relationships with younger girls but if they have an opportunity for attention they wont turn it down. Really weird
I love how unbiased you are I was waiting for you to talk about this
Remember that he had beef with ballslover32 at some point.
wierd video to make considering theres no evidence and if thats not what your gonna say why cast more doubt on it?
Been saying it since the speedrun cheating scandal, Dream's a bum.
Help. I heard Dream nut.
why is ever footage so distorted and blurry
THE MOANING VIDEO NOOOOO 😭
like adding more water to a cup
"sending moaning videos to miners" I mean he is a Minecraft youtuber
Milk tye clowns
Dream is sending people to add more fake fuel to the fire to try to discredit the original claims so that he can play the victim
Sure dreams public image isn’t really helping his current situation but for people to try and frame him to be a pedo just because of some internet beef is crazy, some people are just monsters and only care for themselves and don’t give 2 fucks about other peoples lives and the ramifications of their actions
"Insanity in a nutshell "
Dream never recorded Gumball. Gumball asked another passenger to record him because it would be "epic" , Gumball was calling the Uber driver a retard and a faggot, then called Dream a faggot then slapped him after he threw his phone out of the car, then he was kissing Dream's ass in DMs cuz he knew he fucked up, then lied about Dream on twitter so Dream asked for and posted the video to call him out on it  , which was stupid and only made him look bad of course. The video Dream is making is about Amanda, not Gumball. Disappointed that you didnt really do any background research before making this video, especially when you said you looked into it. The fact you said Dream recorded it means you didnt check anything at all.
Remember when dream made good minecraft vids yea
Dream admitted the moaning was him btw. Hes just arguing it was meant for someone else.
Fuckin hell he showed the actual moaning clips without warning 💀 what's a woman to do to eat in peace
Ok wait, Dream thirst traps? There is no way on God's green earth that anyone, with eyes or ears or connection to humanity that could possibly find Dream, in any way, vaguely sexually attractive enough to be thirst trapped. Slander and calumny
I'm gonna say it how the fuck do people trust him after he was caught cheating speedruns lmao
Bro I still listen to Kanye, god knows ima still watch the manhunts
Yeah I've never known who he was but apparently he did some Minecraft stuff
I'm gonna say it how the fuck do people trust him after he was caught cheating speedruns lmao
God, Dream is just gonna become the next Chris Chan at this point
I'm gonna say it how the fuck do people trust him after he was caught cheating speedruns lmao
Went the way of the Minecraft YouTuber it was inevitable
I fucking hate dream
Where there’s smoke there’s fire. I don’t know, why do these streamers always get accused of stuff? There’s something they did. How come other streamers never have a single accusation?  It’s all about what you do and say when interacting with your fans
I'M WHEEZING AT THE SHANE DAWSON PART 😭😭😭😭
I never knew Charlie had a dog
this is supposed to be serious but i burst out laughing at the kidney stone part
"I think dream is a narcissist" Says the dude who has to make a video about eveey little thing ever......😂
Charlie moaning almost made me fail (6:19)
oh my god i was watching the video full volumen with my mom behind me
The audio is real btw, dream himself confirmed it
I’m clipping that moan Charlie. YOUR DONE FOR
i need that dream 101 guide on how to lose an argument with a drunk and arrogant person
I know the dream drama is smelly stinky But RETURN OF THE CATTO! :D I would pay MONEY to pet that cat, it's so fluffy!
Nah fuck my family. But i hope you all have a good one. :)
Who would’ve thought the Minecraft YouTuber turned out to be a weird creep crazy
Him and josh giddy are in the same boat at the same time
A cat too? Beautiful....
Why is it that just lately the 'Like' count seems to be the SAME on EVERY vid, regardless of the channel 🤔
I liked my own comment
God dream is pathetic it's more than sad now
You only need to look at this comment section to know how fucked up this situation is. People saying shit as factual without any ounce of evidence and it’s all “he said, she said, they said…”. If Dream in general is cringe, the internet’s reaction to this is even more cringe.
Dream dug his own grave, Gumball got the casket and now Charlie is here with the flowers 😭
This makes me worry about the preteen girl who claimed to be “Dreams*xual” in a discord even more. She was hyper unstable parasocial already and would be an easy victim if this is true.
wow wow wow wow how how how everything fucking streamer of the 2010s is done no shit all of them dang
Dream  made me make a youtube  channel  to subscribe  to guys with white shirts  like Charlie  and asmongold
Where is the reset button lol everything is just going downhill for everyone
Grooming is wrong, but gumball seems like a piece of shit. Can someone tell me what dream did wrong?
I watch MoistCritical as if he is the news
Shane Dawson is still catching strays and its fucking hilarious
Dream is a bad guy but that cantu kid is a little entitled prick
Guy yaps so much, 2 times speed helps
Should Dream hire an Astro-physicist professor to help prove he isn’t a pedo? Asking for a friend
Lets get started for Charlie moaning memes
Its the day after thanksgiving i had some microwaved turkey and it was fire 🎉
Charlie is heavily underestimating how horny dudes get and also cocaine exists
I love your cat!
its always the Minecraft YouTubers 💀
I love seeing Charlie say this wack ass shit and he cant keep a straight face cuz of how fucking ridiculous it is 5:35
A nightmare
6:13 get ready to pay for everyone's therapy
Dream really thought he could come in late as a 2nd rate minecraft YouTuber and get away with using it to mask being a toxic loser 💀💀💀
The LGBT COMMUNITY has forgiven the funny blue cat.
okay but did you not see dream saying the moaning audio was revenge porn. meaning those audios were real.
Mannn I remember dream drama back then was like allegations abt faking his manhunts and the stupid speedrun cheating drama 💀💀
I've been on the internet long enough to recognize when a site is turning into 4chan, usually right before losing all funding and disappearing never to be seen again, it seems like twitter is finally circling that drain.
Seems like dream is a classic case of “damned if you do, damned if you don’t.” People are ganging up on him for filming that creepy gum ball dude, but if he didn’t, I’m sure they’d be asking him why he didn’t film and not believing that gum ball was throwing around racist slurs and having an episode
Ngl it did sound like Nicholas was a having a achohol indused manic episode cuz arent they friends in the same uber 😅
been waiting on this vid so I can avoid having to actually read any of the threads myself LMAOOO
Sometimes it takes the brain a while to grow mentally trust me I know I'm still going through it but it's clear that dreams hasn't completely so he doesn't know when to stop
what we can learn from this: DO NOT USE TWITTER
Remember when Dream used to just make fun manhunt videos of Minecraft?  He fell off really hard
Just last week someone on r6 siege found my fb page trough my nick, saw my cover photo from 10 years ago holding my baby sister who was 9 days old at the time and called me a pedophile. This situation shows how child abuse is being viewed in society. There are around three dozen girl cried in my shoulder telling me what they went trough life and how they treated was because of it was far worse than the actual abuse. That's why I'm certain those who made false acquisitions against dream either wishes they can do or actively does what they make fun of because this action is not a joke. Horrible people with shit for brains that's for sure.
happy thanksgiving to all americans!
Late Charlie this is already like 2 years old at this point
Incredibly dumb take to call Dream a 'narcisscist' try learning what the word actually means.
He literally admitted to the moaning video being of him Charles. He called it revenge porn. It seems your research was a little lacking because that’s a very important and incriminating detail.
it's not too uncommon for people to send moaning videos to people they like, i've had people ask me for them before. frick dream btw, hate that guy
6:19
Here's a guy, who said he dove into the world of dream that day, calling people out for making the waters even more muddy.  Ironically making it more murky himself, stay out of it dude, you don't know ANYTHING other than reddit posts, top tier garbage evidence and renders this riding off other people's names for content moot.
Dream is probably a pedo, lets be real, most of these YouTubers probably are.  For teachers, I get it. Without them, theres no education, this is an instance of adults being around children that has to exist in some form.  But what compels someone online to make videos for children and target them as your audience? To gather a viewerbase of people in the ages of 8-13? You are an adult, your interests and maturity level should not blend and be relateable to kids, so you purposely have to be targeting young children.  Its all very odd. I feel like the reason these YouTubers target kids is for nefarious reasons personally. No one can convince me it happens by accident, its coordinated and purposeful.
No gumball no
Eating a Wendy's Baconator and mid way through hearing dream moan was not on my list of plans today but here we are 😂😂😂😭😭
i’ve never seen moist take such a huge L before. what is this man
Id hate to break it to you, Charlie. The moaning being sent to women across any/all dating apps/apps in general is extreme commonplace. Its nasty tbh
charlie :>
6:20 That reminded me of the news woman who falls while stomping grapes. 😅
Dream losing to Gumball while having evidence of him drinking is like using a nuke on a man and missing
Kinda funny how silly the speedrunning controversy he had looks now, lmao
Dream must have taken inspiration from Mini Ladd
Is that the really f up cat
|||||
can i pet the car
5:11 is legit expression of someone's orgasm out there
I have enjoyed the LGBTQ community supporting Cantù in his use of the F slur
legit so not suprised lmao
Hey those moaning clips could even be ai generated
I am not a Dream fan or anything but that moan recording doesn't sound like him at all. I am absolutely not saying all the allegations are false but it would suck if he's falsely acused even if I don't like him in general.
I thought Dream was gay???
Are you Jewish?
They're both losers, but it baffles me Dream is on the losing side so far in the eyes of the internet when so far nothing is confirmed about the allegations, yet we got cold hard proof of Nick being a fucking douche bag spewing fat white women mental disorders as excuses while claiming he's a god.
5:37 someones gonna clip this and make it one of charlie's out of context
Me probably being the only adult in Dream's audience; why am I not surprised? Mans just needs to keep his distance from his fans; they aren't your friends, nor are they the people to turn to when you're having a bad time. Parasocial relationships are a gateway to putting yourself as a creator at risk as well as giving your fangirls hope that they'll be noticed by you.
Lol the dream audio doesnt really sound like dream
Charlie has never been in VRC communities I see.
as someone who knows jack shit about dream, only that he's a minecraft youtuber. This just seems like a targeted hate campain and people joining in because they think its funny.  I am willing to revoke this statement if some ACTUAL proof comes out
Charlie moaned for free???
a
Lost my edging streak to this video and now it’s all over my screen
When I said, “what would Jesus do”, I didn’t mean that Jesus.
I don't think Dream is a narcissist, I'd know. My mother is one. I think he's just full of himself. Classic case of being high on popularity. Most people act like this when they're famous
I don't really find Dream stans too credible in general.
Do you feel it now Mr Krabs
One of dreams biggest problems is that he doesn't know when to shut up and close twitter. These explanations he gives are long and drown out essays with no clear counterpoints or rebuttals and are extremely repetitive. Instead he should take the time and think of something that is actually going to defend himself and doesn't make him sound like a broken record.
Who even is “Dream”?
Hi! if you're going to cover such serious topics it would benefit you to actually look into them a lot more, some of the information you have given is point blank incorrect. For example, dream has ADMITTED that he is the person moaning in the video but twists the narrative with "it was to an overage person" and has said its along the terms of "revenge porn" (which is incorrect)
Pokemain: makes a bad joke in bad taste Moist: gotta make a 10 minute video off the cuff with no nuance Dream: has credible evidence showing him in compromising ways Moist: you know guys, I wanted to sit on this, it’s kinda just all over the place
I really gotta see the kidney stone wanking video now. Anyone know where I can find it?
charlie you recorded yourself moaning
Ya that side of twitter is Bs , anitwt is better in that context
im so glad junky isnt being like crucified online lol i mean a grown man keeping a video of a 19 y/o being drunk after instigating a fight is a weird ass thing to do
The fact that its a snap video is weird to me, like they would have had to be recording as dream was sexting them for it to be legit to what we're seeing on screen, otherwise you wouldnt see the profile attatched to it
I know which portion of this video is gonna get clipped.
Isn't it already old
The way dream reacted to this situation makes me believe it was 100% real 😂
Just remembered Dream exists. Day ruined.
I love hearing guys moan, but I'm prob in the minority here
Imagine getting violated by gumball
Charlie, Dream confirmed in his Twitter essay that the moaning audio is real, though he claims he sent it to someone above age and that it leaking is "revenge pr0n"
COLLEENNNN
6:19-6:24 WE'RE MAKING OUTTA SNAPCHAT MESSAGES WITH THIS ONE💀🔥🔥🔥
moist critcal jumpscare [5:10]
Misinput?
I will come to Nick's defense with the car scene. That is embarassing, he shouldn't have said the things he said. But he was in the car, drunk and high. This shouldn't have been posted online. The video is fine imo, he should've even shown it to Nick when he sobered up, but he posted it online, which I think is also a shitty thing to do. I've had drunk moments in the car where I've said things i regret too, not slurs but i have definitely opened my mouth more than i should. Thank god i was in the military and the people i was around understood and have been there as well, so they checked on me the next day and then we never mentioned it again.
who tf is Dream?
KITTY!!!!
weirdos posting moans on the internet is enough to convince people apparently. Theyre dumb
Maybe the guy wasn’t so good at manhunt
Holy shit... He only F*cked up once... then its disaster.. About Nick, i watch the vid.. And its crazy for the people that are on the side of nick. Holy Shit You are all Crazy.. Well i guess its an "american thing".🤣
tbh i feel like if ur known as a minecraft streamer youre just a pedophile (i know its not truee but this is how it feel)
When his rise to fame is through cheating and lying, its no wonder he keeps finding himself as the butt of the joke
I send moaning videos to miners. Coal miners, gold miners, even the guys who do the sand mining that's really just bulldozing the top soil off and digging a hole. I send moaning videos to all of them.
Well if dream days directly the moans are revenge porn it's gotta be real right
I love how everyone still calls it twitter
I see you had a cat and a dog with you. You having tacos for thanksgiving?😂
Where the fuck is Darwin!?
I'm glad it's not just me finding this drama impossible to understand. I guess it's what happens when you're a narcissist who cultivates a gigantic audience of mainly Twitter-obsessed kids. Lots of serious allegations, lots of hyperbole, lots of "omg he LITERALLY ADMITTED TO IT", but a lack of real, solid, actual evidence. Dream's reaping what he sows here, when your audience is mainly children with no attention spans, of course your claims of innocence are gonna be met with "I'm not reading all that, anyway you admitted to it".
twitter's gone wacky this time
dream did confirm he sent it by making a tweet and responding to the things and calling it 'revenge porn' id think youd know that if you had it as the thumbnail 5:49
This is what happens when you cater your YouTube content towards 13yr olds for years lol. Idk why he expected to have tons of adults in his fan base when he turned to music. Do you know who you were catering to for all these years?
Can you make a video about the Josh Giddey situation in the NBA?
6:19
You should cover Ned Luke (GTA V Michel va) getting swatted
Dream just couldn’t beat Gumball “Walk ‘em down” Watson 😭
do people actually celebrate thanksgiving ? i thought it was just one of them weird meme holidays Americans come up with like national hamburger day
4:00 I can't forgive you for having me watch this
now i don't wanna have sex with charlie
I still feel bad for Dream, he was the most successful Minecraft YouTuber for a bit and then he did a face reveal and it’s been all downhill for him since then
I love how h3 was like I’m not gonna show this because it’s extortion and then Charlie just shows it cuz they got a minor beef right now😂
00:02 Dream is currently facing numerous accusations and allegations on Twitter. 01:24 Multiple claims and evidence regarding Dream's inappropriate behavior on social media 02:42 Dream's inappropriate online behavior raises concerns and gives credibility to the claims made against him. 04:01 There is no concrete evidence connecting the alleged dream Snapchat account to Dream himself. 06:30 It is difficult to determine what is true and what is false in the Dream controversy. 07:48 Dream captures footage of Nicholas behaving inappropriately towards him. 09:00 Dream is addressing the situation in a comprehensive video
i love how dream tried to cancel cantu for saying the f slur even tho cantu is queer ( pansexual)
charlie is definately getting clipped at 6:23
obv a hit and a character assassination for some reason remember ai voice ? makes it trivial to claim anything
I don’t watch the news anymore I watch Charlie
I’ve had it with Dream’s stupid crap. The dude and his rapid fanbase are terminally online and the definition of “Go outside and touch some grass.”
Starting at 5:40 is perfect for clips without context
6:19 CLIP THAT CLIP THAT😂😂
OH GOD  VOMITING INDUCING TRASH THERE  gotta be one of the best in 2023
cancel culture turned into hate culture. hate gains impressions kids think a hit tweet will make them rich. they did the same shit to james Charles when police got involved they didnt arrest james but made the accusers take down the fake tiktoks but damage was already done. if james ever actually sent a nude to a minor he would be in jail like drake bell.
2.4 mil in 19 hrs holy fucking shit
Don’t know who this dream is but he’s definitely into touching kids.. guilty af tryin to throw other people under the bus
When Charlie shuddered out of disgust it sounded like the moan, case closed the moan was Charlie.
Lmao I don’t think very many of us  are surprised.
Not normal in dudes but dream isnt normal look at him & all he does 😂 Ive had exs send me vids of them masturbating, squirting, twerking, spit play, in the shower, moaning just audio, playing with themselves at work even shy innocent exs did this so its not impossible or uncommon. Dream always was a weirdo so him doing that not unbelievable at all.
Youtuber that caters to kids who got caught cheating not being involved in drama challenge difficulty: impossible  Never even knew who he was until he posted his cheated Minecraft speedrun and the entire world lost their mind for a day then forgot about it within a week. This current situation is probably deserved though. It seems pretty rare for people with a history like his to be innocent in a situation like this. But hey, he'll always be able to say this: "At least I'm not Logan Paul."
Quite a few clippable moments in this video
This video does have errors. Like he admitted that the Snapchat moaning videos were him.  Idk man it just feels like more effort went into the stupid cookie “controversy” than serious grooming allegations
getting gumball vs dream before gta 6 is crazy
Didn't dream admit the audio is him?
Dream is a pervert.
you know when youtube jesus starts on something shits about to go down
@charliemalick8985 it’s kinda sad but disgusting tho. I’m celebrating thanksgiving today so happy Thanksgiving to all of y’all
i have had guys send me videos of them moaning so
You know what the worst part is?       I can actually see and hear gumball saying that without being drunk
Nicolas actually seemed like a normal fucking person even when drunk, high and in a weird state of mind. Dream has never seemed normal
L take
There’s no shot he’s not a PDF file
Dream also went to my house personally and gave me 1 kilogram of stainless steel. This is true. I don't know how he got my IP address. Please help me.
happy thanksgiving penguinz0
huh. who knew a mf playing a childrens game was in love with children
My guy was doing the character creator voices when theyre being hit.
I cackled for like a whole minute when I heard the Snapchat video
Did dream not confirm it was him in the videos?
Dream blackmailing wasn’t on my bingo card lol
I also thought the moaning video was totally fake, but then he referred to it as revenge porn and not like false accusations. So like... He incriminated himself
Who would have known a Minecraft YouTuber is a weirdo
I’m sorry but the phrase “terminally horny” has me absolutely dying 😂
I be in my girls ear like
Who gives a shit
Never thought I’d hear you say a Shane Dawson moan 😅😅😅
Thats crazy. Who tf cares about dream drama?
It seems you forgot to mention that Dream himself *admitted those moaning audios are his.* In the same tweet you used for the thumbnail, he literally calls the allegations "revenge porn", which basically confirms that yes, those audios are him, and the only defense he had for it is that he supposedly sent it to Nat, one of his exes who was of age. Said ex went out of her way on her twitter account to prove that she wasn't in contact with Dream at the time, and therefore there was no way those audios could've been sent to her. Please do some better research next time when the topic is as serious as pedophilia.
worste thing is, doesn't matter if he did or did not, his reputation is already fucked because of this. Guilty even if he isn't. But also, RIP.
Im eating popcorn as im whatching this
6:09 yes charlie... as sad as it is, it actually is common for dudes wanting moan videos/audios... its not common that a girl would want that though so idk why "dream" is the one moaning XD
Ik this seams wierd as shit to alot of people, but i fail to see what dream did wrong with the gumball VA. If i was as famous as dream id have a body cam on at all times. The mans stupid famous and when you are that famous the risk of false allegations and violence against you goes up. Also everyone defending gumball VA saying he was drunk, high, and manic need to get their life together. If the man is prone to manic episodes he shouldnt have drank or smoked , period end of story. It isnt dreams job to baby sit him and put up with him if he chose to put himself in that predicament. Id have left the guy long before that moment and you can blame dream for not doing that. But really? Recording a potentially dangerous situation and posting a legal adult doing shit he probably shouldnt. Is this the hill we wanna die on against dream? Sure the man is sleazy but come on get a better argument for me to give a crap
The man should just… leave Twitter.
6:19-6:25 sounds like the news lady when she fell trying to stomp cranberries
my only good memory of dream will always be his first manhunt videos before he made it big
Bruh why does every successful minecraft player become a pedo😭
6:18 I'll never forget that scene trust me
What's crazy is I never even heard of this guy before
4:45 Dream did actually confirm that audio belonged to him in his private twitter account!
even if he really sent a moaning audio to a minor, whats the problem? support amos yee free speech to talk about cheese pizzas
3:54 Do not assault my ears with those terrible sounds lol.
"There's nothing connecting these accounts to these videos"  Well so then I, and everyone around me, listened to the loud moaning for nothing?
Need conk creet evidence 🤓
But he admitted that the moaning vids were real in his tweet he called it "revenge corn"
tbh when I was in my teens , I knew what I was doing when I talked to older men. There is no way any girl / guy over 15 + doesn’t know what they aren’t doing when the reply clearly says ( I love your tits ) like IF this was real even if it wasn’t dream if she was still a minor she knew what she was doing 🤔
Plot twist: this video of Charlie fake
Minor or not, that shits cringe IMO. Almost every “dreams a child predator” claim has like zero (solid) evidence. Innocent until proven guilty. That dude and his fans are weirdos though for sure.
He doesn't need Minecraft he needs a church,        And an exorcist
These kids and their “cross faded” in my day that was just chillin 😂😂
Damn why is Charlie kink shaming, my girlfriend likes when I moan
We're in the moan-zone now
What was that about a man passing a kidney stone while cumming???
I’m gonna make so many ‘Charlie out of context’ videos out of this
I thnk dream is stirring it up himself because everyoe forgot about him after fave reveal
Yikes
I just cant imagine the mental health of one of the terminally online losers actually invested in this
Dream Dream, more like Dream Cream
Imagine it is dream and he’s watching this and crying like “I thought it was kinda hot”
I was so excited when I saw this upload cause I hoped it would clear everything up, but Charlie is just as lost as me lmfao
Charlie moaning has just made my day 🤭
Dream should have never taken off his mask 😂😂😂
"#2 on Trending for gaming"
As soon as the moaning started I accidentally clicked off the video, it was a pure natural reaction, my body couldnt handle it
4:11 does the top contact say “Dream Dream” with the second saying “Stan Dream” 😭
To this day that Shane Dawson shit is still wild. Like why admit to it, humping a cat to completion is something navy seals couldn't torture out of me
"Dream has beef with the voice actor for Gumball" is not a sentence I thought I would ever utter but here we are.
..." you talking to a michelangelo  " 😂😂😂  you just make money selling entertaiment for children
As I don't know the classic memes, the part from 5:02 to 5:13 made me laugh so hard that I went into a cough fit! Amazing!
habsburg chin boy up to some tomfoolery once again
6:20
No sending videos of yourself moaning isn't normal.....unless it's with the bois....then anything goes
Twitter detectives are working as flawlessly as ever I see. Dream is gonna lose in the court of public opinion every single time because he was this massive figure in the gaming sphere who's now more vulnerable than ever, so everyone is gonna rally against him and kick him while he's down. I haven't seen any of the creepy shit but if it's warranted to call him a creep, then so be it. But Gumball man was unhinged and definitely does not need to be defended after that bs
Let's be honest, we're all here just to hear Charlie moan...
Although posting the thirst traps to your audience when they may be kids could be harmful but you talk SEXUALLY almost every video lmfao and I know for a million % fact you have millions of children watching these videos it’s hypocritical
6:20 lmfao this is a crazy sound byte
We're witnessing Gumball Watterson roast the crap out of Dream. This timeline just gets weirder and weirder.
Thanks Keanu
2:30  Only people who don't know what a narcissist is would think Dream is one. Whether he is a dozen other horrible things or not, that's one thing he is not. These days anyone with any negative personality traits will be called a narcissist, making the whole 'diagnosis' pointless. If you're a douchebag, you apparently immediately have narcissistic personality disorder. Couldn't just be that you're socially awkward idiot with emotional issues and toxic traits.
1:01 the way you use words is hilarious 😂
I am at work and I literally am serving a customer Chinese food and I get to hear dream mone in my ear what a world we live in
being drunk and high does not make you someone else. You're still you. You're ofcourse intoxicated and have looser lips but honestly if you say it with your chest your really meant it at the moment.
Passing a kidney stone meme while coming WTF ROFL
Wait he has a dog??
Dream just needs to man up
They literally show that the videos are from his Snapchat account in one of the videos next to the one you showed of him moaning, there are like 3 separate videos showing that it is infact his account. He even later admitted that it was infact him. You are literally fighting tooth and nail to stay “in the middle” when there is so much evidence showing that he’s a grooming pedophile, it seems you are purposely ignoring evidence just to hold a “maybe” stance when it is a “definitely.”
i just realised when Charlie said minors i kept thinking about miners(as in fans of minecraft)
Amazing world of gumball is gas I don’t like dream😂🎉
5:36 nani?! my hips are moving on their own?!
Dream fingied me bumhole and I have proof
I’m honestly not surprised ever since his face reveal I thought to myself this guy is gonna be getting allegations
I want to have The series of noises Charlie made on as my ringtone
DANTDM needs more subs than Dream
Charlie of course people make fake allegations just to stir the pot. Twitter will never be a trusted source 😂
Y'all better leave Dream alone. He's getting hit left and right by accusations and even for an ordinary content creator that is like a dynamite being shoved down your throat. He had been assaulted and did wrong, and he needs to find someone who should be held responsible or accountable for it.
That cat is 90% fluff ❤
What truly distrubs me is thst theres so much "evidence" but really its just doxxing every conversation dream has has privately  And ehile dream doesn't helo himself..... He's only in his  20s and i don't have thr attention or care to care about a early adult.
Honestly not surprised that dream is getting cancelled lol
I miss slap fights.😢
I have recieved a moaning vid from a girl idk i didnt rly find it attractive but i guess
31.8 million subs wtf 😳
Congratulations on trending
Hi Charlie I just want you to know I put the Jesus picture of you in my Irish presentation for my junior cert.
To me all of this sounds like something Dream would do
It’s crazy to me how people blame dream for „answering to the drama in the wrong way” and not the people who wrongly accuse him. I’m not on anyones side here but the thruth. I think some of you should get off the hate and start acting like a mature normal human being
I like how the top comment is literally a stolen comment lmao
Hey Charlie. You have a beautiful face.
I can only say that the stupidest evidence is the one you can find when there is a scandal against a famous person, when it is about some random dude they can even get God's underwear and a unicorn.
truly wish i did not hear this
lets not forget that dream literally cheated at speedrunning
0 research made, well done
The only reason that i dont think he would do this stuff is because he knows he has been on the watchlist for years and no celebrity is that stupid to do this stuff knowing how hated they are. (i hope)
The thing with Dream is, he got so much hate (deservedly) after the cheating scandal and his fanbase is so insufferable, people want this stuff to be true. Every accusation against him must always be questioned because people will make shit up about him, they often did. I have, by now, decided for myself that I will just not believe anything and disengage from the entire community.
It’s hard to pinpoint the dream case because twitter is so obsessed with cancelling this guy they’d rather twist details than settle and focus on the actual evidence there is on this guy. He’d be gone so much quicker if they weren’t so biased.
Um can Charlie please never demonstrate moaning, like never ever again…? 😅
Dream stans always get angry when dream gets hated on  But he’s not easy to like  He’s *very* easy to hate on
Thank you for your service, detective Charles
I really feel bad for Dream. It feels like he’s been screwed over by the internet, starting with his insanely quick rise to fame
#2 trending on gaming XDDDDD
It is straight up not weird to film someone who accosted/is accosting you. The only reason ppl are defending Cantu is the reason why Cantu wanted to fight dream:  Jealousy.
Bro, this be like battle royal
that snapchat clip looks old, snapchat looks very different from that now
its like the linus situation
dream admitted the video is real in his response. he said that the clips being spread around are akin to revenge porn, confirming it is him in the video. evidence that this clip was sent to a minor is not concrete. i wouldn’t be surprised if the recipient of the video was a minor, but even if they aren’t the situation is an abuse of a power dynamic.   honestly insane he would admit it is him in the clip. there was NOTHING tying him to it prior to his response.  dear content creators, don’t sext fans. just don’t do it.
I am imagining the situation at Twitter being like the church fight scene from Kingsman
This is exactly why I don't think a content creator should communicate with minors. I mean if the conversation is moderated and public than it might be ok, but it's just unreal how often these kind if alogations get thrown out. Not saying these alogations are real or not, just saying.
is this twitter imploding on itself?
Dream did what to my turtle at 3am?!
I actually only came for the clips of moist catical and dogz0
We lost inquistor3 beacuse of false accusations now if dream does it man like why
Dream allegedly gave nick the alcohol (nick is 20 so a minor in the us) so that’s bad enough, but he pretty much confirmed the moaning vids were him because he’s saying people are spreading revenge p0rn of him
me n my friend catfished our other friend n got him to send moaning vids lmao
He's a 20 year old man whose fans are children
My friend was the minor he sent them to.
5:08 How peng orgasms.
...again
soundtrack of this guy moaning. selling for $1,000,000,000,000,000
Selling whimper audios is a side hustle but unprovoked and free is insane
Im pretty sure dream hmself admitted it was his voice a couple days ago
Allegedly it wasn’t dream filming, Cantu asked to be filmed by another passenger cuz he was gonna destroy everyone in the car lmao
Why TF is Dream still around? He hasn't made a video in forever and clearly just attracts hate
Hey Charlie idk if youve noticed recently but every YouTube video is labelled to have had less likes than it actually does and I find that very weird. Every channel I’m on, Smosh being a good example where every video has 3k likes until you look into it and they have way more. I might be wrong or it might just be on my end but I think it’s weird
I LITERALLY WAS OPENING YOUTUBE GOING “I hope Charlie covers the dream situation” let’s fucking go
I'm out. These videos are lazy and lack substance.
Day 13 waiting for better camera
Honestly could of went without the moaning💀 I’m at work
i did not need to hear dream moaning at 9 in the morning, thanks charlie
I must be old cause I dont know any of the people you spoke about in this video
doesn't matter if dream's in the wrong or not. I'm cringing either way. Imagine being clowned on for your face reveal and having the gull to post thirst traps
6:18 Straight out of Banjo Kazooie
Who in the fuck is Dream?! I have never heard of him in the 14 years I’ve watched YouTube
His name is Dream Simp what else is to be expected?
im in a psych ward u made me laugh hahahah thanks moist
Figuring out these allegations is like trying to debunk Evangelion
Dream cheats at minecraft thats all you really need to know to dislike him
Nah bro why would you show the vid ☠️ it could be revenge prn
Daamn rumplestiltskin is going through it
6:18 minecraft youtubers when minors simply exist:
ngl i always thought dream was a good guy hes inarguably good at minecraft and also is pretty smart and i always thought he was a good person and now im just confused on wth is going on
Never should of done the face reveal
Lets not defend dream now alright?
Fan base is majority minors, he actively promotes them being parasocial, it literally would not be a surprise if it’s all proven true that he is a groomer. The red flags are literally there waves in everyone’s faces.
I love how Charlie makes a video basically saying "I have no idea what is going on, and I have nothing to add." And he gets number 2 on trending.
List of things I knew about Dream before this video.. 1: He cheated at Minecraft speed running.
Dream is creepy along with any grown adult streaming kids games pretending they don't have child audiences. I'm disappointed in H3 for acting like they had noooo ideaaaaa with like 8 people in their crew.
jesus hearing dream in that snap was a jump scare
6:01 I know a guy who’s done that, his name is Dream
I could see dream being some pervert on the down low.  Dream is such a strange individual
Charlie's got kitties and dogs and I love his entire pet family. Also Dream's dumb.
Dream and Velveteen Dream would be a good tag team.
I already KNOW that charlies moaning will be taken out of context in a clip
I got to be the one to start the argument at thanksgiving dinner by telling my Dream simp sister that she has a chance since shes a minor and she got mad at me then my dad brought up a senator that got caught being a pedo and that kicked off the main political argument
Dude, i just realized, just a couple moments ago, that i think i might be truly traumatized by Dream's face reveal, the like .5th of a second after he pulled the mask away when his eyebrows went up and his eyes and mouth widened just a bit with an ah HA! kind of expression, because now, picturing that with the moaning that might or might not be him, and like i didnt really puke, or gag, but my mouth got that hot weird saliva and my stomach CHURNED. Time to take a break from the internet.
That Nicolas Cantu dude sounds like an actual prick. Also sounds like he huffed 20 pack of 20 in 20 seconds. He will never be as good as Logan Groves.
1:09 so dream wrote the bible 2
let me guess, he's being accused of talking inappropriately to minors.  Edit: Bullseye
charlie moaning is the funniest shit ever i stg 6:18
I was checking Charlie’s channel every day waiting
0:10 what the dog doing?
Happy thanksgiving Charles.
Who sends moaning videos
I'm more focused on his hair being half erect
Happy thanksgiving good ol Charlie
6:21 Cr1tikal moans just dropped
All I knew about dream, where that his fans where God awful, and jschlatt basically destroyed them when he banned them on his twitch, so 😠 m just happy there taking another L
More plot twists than AOT.
This is 18 on the hot list for gaming.. I've literally never watched a Charlie game, I'm only here for the news 😂
Why does everything happen with Dream
unfortunately I've had guys send voice clips of them moaning while jerkin it
Minecraft Youtubers and grooming minors is a more iconic duo than Mario and Luigi.
I still dunno who dream properly is after 5 years of hearing about him. After all these years all I know about him is hes a dickhead.
6:19 Thanks for the new message sound for my phone, Charlie!
Bro why would you actually play the moaning audio, I got headphones on 😭😭😭😭😭😭
i know there is gonna be so much charlie out of context here
The whole time I’m thinking “who tf is dream?” This makes me feel better
1) Swoop collab when? This would be the power couple we need 2) The problem of parasocial/predatory interactions is so widespread it's honestly become a daily thing - which in itself is scary as all 7 circles of hell. 3) The fact that these "influencers" are caught in a spiral of weaponising their viewer base/denying/apologising/monetising....rinse repeat; is the biggest accidental Darwinian experiment in history.
Dream never fails to look like a predator.
Man the amount of .lies and just hatred for dream is what's actually crazy People.don't even care about the nick aituation, it's always just dream wrong, dream bad regardless of proof People just hate him so much you could straight up lie about him with proof you are.lying and people will believe you I really dont like dream, he's a slimy weird little man, but the hate bandwagon has everyone jumping on and trashing him regardless of its right or wrong If this is you, you are as slimy and degenerate as dream
Just insane to me that Gumball went on a huge self entitled rant, degrading someone he thought was lesser than him and comparing himself to MICHAELANGELO while throwing out slurs but people still only care about Dream. Sure it's hilarious how Dream lost to THAT, but people should most definitely be talking about how much of a scumbag Gumball is. Being drunk or high doesn't excuse that. There is definitely some truth to "a drunk mind speaks sober thoughts".
*records awkward moaning of Charlie* Guys look! Charlie moaned on camera! He even made an OF Acc! *cue clip obviously made for comedy/satire without proof of an account*
let's not celebrate thanksgiving tho
Honestly, my oppinion is to just leave dream alone. There is no evidence against him and making his life to hell wont help, sadly a lot of ppl apperently think that. and if hes that bad just ignore him and stop hating, if there is real evidence against him the polce  and the media will do sth against him, what they dont because there is no evidence only 16 year olds trying to make dreams life bad
No it isn't, what's with the Clickbait trash title?? This is another Monday for dream, nothing crazy, quite normal now actually
Its so sad it seems like Dream is walking in Cryaotic's footsteps... 😥
i know people were begging you to make a video on these allegations but this is so poorly researched. setting some of the facts straight:  -the videos are seen in a discord screenshot that has a timestamp from 2019 -the minor is confirmed to actually be a minor circa 2019 -dream follows them on twitter to this day -dream was confirmed to have that snapchat nickname/icon back then -dream himself confirmed the videos to be real! only he alleged they were sent to a girl from his past, not a minor, and alleges that that person is staging this whole thing because the original discord screenshot was taken by her -this girl didn’t even know dream yet at the time of the screenshot, and she showed proof of this -he lied that this girl dated his abusive ex to discredit her, and substantiated it by using a screenshot of the girl referring to dating someone who happened to have the same name as his ex (the person who they were actually referring to came forward and confirmed they were talking about them, not dream’s ex) -dream showed the girl screenrecording their snapchat conversation *after* the burner was posted as proof that they screenrecorded the evidence on the burner, when that video isn’t being screenrecorded, it’s being filmed from another phone. more lies to descredit her -the girl has a well corroborated story about how their screenshot got into circulation so that’s not proof that the burner is them either  there’s probably more. basically dream pinned it on an innocent person because they have a history of mental instability so the allegations could be discredited. he’s already been caught in multiple lies. it’s not looking good for him.
Ain’t dream there guy who made the Eeveelution squad amvs
remember his large video about him not cheating..... and he was cheating uh oh
I wish you did went more in depth into the conflict, because from my current context (only this video) it baffles me that people took Nicolas side after what he filmed. Like sure, there is the minors interactions stuff, but I mean, the other guy seems to be in the wrong in that video.
No matter what channel children will always be the majority viewer. I don’t get the whole “you make kids content” unless you actually make kids content. Playing Minecraft doesn’t turn it into kids content and no swearing doesn’t either, people edit their videos in these ways so they’re monetised not so children will watch it. Hate to say it but dream probably didn’t care who watched his videos as long as they get views. Also just because kids flock to something doesn’t give reason to blame the creator as if they intended it. I mean come on generalising every dream fan as a kid is like saying everyone who watches penguinz0 is a melt brain who can’t make up their own opinion on a mater so they have someone else do it for them, lol.
OOOOOOOOOOOO
he did confirm that those moaning videos were real but denied that he send them to a 17 year old. until he can prove that he sent them to a grown adult he's a nonce in my eyes
thats what im saying
didnt dream confirm that yes it was him in that snapchat video, but on his private account?
How is this 1# for GAMING?
Imagine getting smacked by a twig who calls himself gumball and doing nothing about it.
Cant wait for 6:22 to be taken out of context
lmao
My biggest problem with this situation is how many people are treating it as a joke and piling the joke on twitter.
Thats not a dream... its a nightmare!
To defend guys moaning.. we do like it consensually.. guys need to moan more. But send them consensually.😅
dream needs a callmecarson type break from the Internet. shit wont end until he just goes away n maybe comes back(hopefully not)
I don't know if I should laugh or feel bad about him. Like the only bad (confirmed) things I know about him is his fanbase and cheating in Minecraft, yet he somehow manages to beclme this low quality internet antagonist, like bro how do you even manage to do that 💀
YouTube needs to stop these grown adults who produce gaming content exclusively for kids. Mainly because my 6 year old insists on spending his TV time watching them and I am sick of it, but also because they are all annoying and creepy.
one day men will stop protecting predators and not believing victims
Dream confirmed the audio and the texts…the victim was also proven to be a minor (Jamie updated her age each year on her profile)
its been proven charlie not doing his research and saying he cant know if that was dream or if the girl was a minor is hurting the victims
very disappointing video:( you ignored so much vital information, especially coming from victims that dream didnt even debunk... dream literally ADMITTED it was him 4:45 HE CALLED IT "REVENGE PORN" like bffr
What if he hid his identity just in case things like this happened, they wouldn't know who he was lol
6:19 clipped for future false allegations.
You know whats crazier? Pyro beat you on time on this 1
6:46 neo in the first 30 minutes of matrix
Let's go gumball
it sounds like dream 💀💀 i watched too many of his streams and vids
I like how the quality of the images are the lowest possible and it calls that proof.
Cantu is guilty, plain and simple. I'm glad you agreed on this Charlie and yeah, everything else is such a jumbled mess. It's impossible to make out what the hell is going on with so many random people making stuff up. What is real or false, I'm afraid only Dream can tell us in his video now. I wish people would calm down and wait for it instead of making things more confusing.  For Cantu to get drunk, when he knows  BPD doesn't mix well with alcohol and then ask people to record him being a cringelord is irresponsible. But still entirely his fault, mental illness is not an excuse. Also getting drunk doesn't magically make you a homophobe and an ableist (among the other things), he was those things to begin with.
Dream admitted it was him and called it revenge porn
I love how Charlie is just a news reporter for all of YouTube
Little did Charlie know… it was all a dream
The internet is the worst product we have ever made. It has absolutely ruined people.  No matter how you look at it.  If dream did it, or if people are making false claims. Either way. It ruined people.
the dog looking at the cat :)))))) in shock that the cat can go on the desk
His hair makes him look like the other mom from Coraline.
Am I the only one to notice that what Nicolas said was smth Gumball would say xD
Why does the minecraft community have so much damn drama
The word you keep looking for is: exonerate
a wild thought, maybe we should stop believing what is said on twitter. I feel like it is obvious by now that 90% of all twitter allegations are fake, and it is because people there just don't need ANY valid proof to believe something. And i feel like we should just ignore it all together, but for some reason, even people, who i concider thoughtfull, still talk about those alegations, like there is even something to talk about
Why can't more content creators be like Charlie? Unproblematic.
6:19  😏
those moans charlie made are gonna be in every "mo1stcr1tikal out of context" video
This is 101% Something gumball would do
dream literally admitted that the moaning is him. he is claiming that he sent them to someone of age and she has proven that that is not true sooo, no the voice notes aren’t just some random person. they quite literally are dream.
Everybody is talking about Charlie's moans but here i am shitting myself after hearing his Super Saiyan scream 5:10
Gumball, fucking Watterson
Nobody talking about the glow up IO had.
Guess he has been getting some fever dreams instead of normal ones for the past few months.
yeah i would not be surprised that somebody who lied about cheating in minecraft out of all places would be a pdf file
I can definitely see why people are upset. Me personally? I get waayyyyy worse and creepier shit sent to me every week. So I wouldn’t get overly emotional about this kinda thing, I’d just block him and move on with my life. But that’s just me though.
I've been waiting for this video
It’s funny that Charlie thinks people don’t send moaning videos bahahah
Fuck Dream, just hate him for being Dream. Its so funny he cant calm down, he always has to react and he is making a fool outof himself, fuck Dream, love Gumball.
Anyone making minecraft videos and is not 10 is a red flag
Why is your thanksgiving food moving on your desk?
Your pets are so cute
Why is it that someone who I dont really care about or even like at all actually ends up being a creepy or non good person?? for a few years now I have not cared for Dreams content, or really liked him, and I always felt his fanbase was toxic cause every Dream fan I encountered would act like a jackass lmao (though to be fair, like Charlie said, majority of them are children, so they probably don`t know better) do I just have a bad person senser built into my brain? lmao
where there's smoke there's fire, u don't see this shit happening to other streamers so why dream specifically? maybe its just a really bad coincidence one after another after another or maybe he did do a bunch of vile shit and now its all leaking out...
dream confirmed the moaning vid was him instead of saying it wasnt 💀
Ok so one is atleast allegedly talking sexually to minors and other is probably anti semetic and racist? Ok they're both bad . Saw this while video and still dont understand what's going with these two
A YouTuber that's been outed as a predator? Who'd have thought such a thing could happen. /s
i really hope that people keep calling twitter, twitter atleast until elons death in like 60 years just to piss him off for making such a stupid decision, like  john key trying to change nz's flag and ending up spending za bunch of money and getting know where forward with it.
@penguinz0 for president. I would vote for this guy.
Charlie’s cat with the mic checks!
Remember when he was accused of cheating in Minecraft? He kept saying he'd put out an intensive video proving he didn't cheat... This is, so far playing out the same way. I hope the results are different this time..
It's almost like the internet full of anonymous children and no chain of custody should never be considered a place where justice can be dealt out fairly.  Especially when the allegations aren't crimes of character but actual crimes.
was it too hard to research that dream wasnt the one who filmed nick and nick was the one who TOLD his friend to film him? also it was not a manic episode and nick said that he wasnt blackout drunk, just a little
clay exposed himself, he said it was “revenge porn” (talking ab the moaning vids)
I always love a glimpse of the cat or one of the dogs in the videos! Charlie just looked so confused on what the cat was going to do on the desk … we need a pet cam sometimes 🥺
The highlight of this video is truly Charlie awarding us with his godlike moans.
I'm not really surprised to be honest.
Why is it always so minecraft youtuber 💀💀
6:19 hmmmm this sounds exactly like the snaps i got last night. Coincidence?
Rs who gets that horny to send moaning vids 😭
This dude
We just need to hire a real astrophysicist from the real Harvard to make sense of all these allegations and write a paper about it.  Things will clear up very quickly, I promise!
Shouldve stuck to minecraft
I thought it was a Shane Dawson moan 😭😭😭😭
5:04 for future me
Its so amazing seeing charlie talk about it and so many people STILL apparently can't read OR listen. I feel like im in a black mirror epsiode, i genuinely refuse to believe this many people are stupid
What Is Happening To Youtube!?!?
Came out 12 hours ago and it’s already #3 trending in gaming
this entire video is going on someone's soundboard.
6:20 ... i just know this is getting clipped.
Honestly, I don't know Dream's videos at all so for all I know they took audio of him stubbing his toe from somewhere. What I do know is Dream and Nicholas Cantu are clearly both assholes, and the people choosing to side with him over Dream simply because they hate Dream need a hobby or something.
Didn't he have a face reveal thing a little while back? Where were these accusations when he finally came public with his appearance? It's odd that nobody said anything that caught anyone's attention when his face was finally revealed. It seems that would have been a great moment to provide any proof you have that could match his image, whereas before it would be just audio or messages anyone could make. Like Charlie says at one point in this vid. Why now, and not back then when he had all that attention.
I don’t like Dream but I don’t understand why people are upset at him recording someone who was freaking out towards him, like any normal person would definitely get their phone out if they felt threatened and wanted to prove their innocence and now everyone is attacking him for it ? Doesnt make much sense
I see double charle
Damn
WHY DID YOU COPY PYRO
has anyone made a porn version of Godslap called Godfap yet?
Charlie moan: 6:18
sick and twisted.
that cat
Dudes doing weird shit like moaning over voice is sadly a thing. I play world of Warcraft and I got into a call with someone for the first time and I had been chatting with for a bit  over text but he just  started moaning and trying to talk dirty.. didn't even say hi lmao Just a huge wtf..I don't get how these types of guys think that's gonna do it  for us lol.
Guys do you all realise that girls actually find a man moaning for them hot?
Finally Charlie made a video about this, I was so confusing since there are too many things going around while there isn't any solid evidence. At least I trusted his opinion.
Gumball Watterson beating the shyit outta dream is something I never thought I'd see in this timeline.
3:46 WHATTTT😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 WHAT😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭⁉️😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭WHATTTTTRTTRTTTTT😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
dream should just say any sorta evidence is just A.I., easy way out i'd say.
Can we stop saying that literally everything "is crazy"
6:19 content boys
Charlie is the best dude guy 💦
who is dream
6:19 a critic sends moist video to minecrafters
Dream is one of those people that would instinctively throw water on a grease fire...6 times in a row.  He genuinely can't seem to sit down and shut up. Oh well.
How did we get to the point of giving these people any attention
wth is this obsession of influencers with minors 💀
As if “children” dont watch porn or are into sexy ladies lol. Charlie always reaching with this stuff
I like how Charlie goes from condemning anyone who would defend this type of behavior in one video, to defending this type of behavior in this video. It must be challenging to be so consistent
Charlie you're gonna regret those exaggerated moans
so.... did he fake that speed run or naw?
I think everyone can universally agree that Dream, guilty or not, has handled the situation poorly in all regards. Instead of making a response video with evidence and a clear cut discussion of the claims, he chose to indulge in replying to every single hate tweet he gets. Much like people who have been accused before, and refuted the claims, the best thing he could have done is gone off grid and gathered evidence and made a response with structure, this isn't the first time someone is being cancelled, so he has examples of people who have endured the same things and actually managed to clarify everything.
his disbelief at the fact that people would send these audio clips is pretty funny, top tier feline floof though also 15/10.
Playing through videos at work listening in my big ass headphones and hear Dream and Charlie moaning. I’m about to quit.
6:19 **FilthyFrank flashbacks**
Is dream that minecraft guy that owns that SMP server?
Listen I am not the biggest fan of dream and if these allegations are true then yeah, he deserves to get locked up like that's insane. But let's not forget innocent until proven guilty. Even critical was hitting at it in the vid. By the time Dreams video is out we'll know if he really is innocent.
not relavent at all but anyone else wondering what it would look like watching charlie record this?
Cat situation is whacky
Man I just hope you don't ever get into any kind legal shit against any other youtubers who might wanna get back at you. Keep real and safe Charlie
I just really wanna play the claw machine. I can't take my eyes off it every video lol
any drama is good drama. dream is loving this attention i bet.
6:00 discord has entered the chat and has sent you an mp3
Let me just drop my three icebreaker phrases here: "haha Minecraft Youtuber is a pedo" "haha cringe speed run guy got beat up by Gumball!" and my best one: "haha dream moan audio just dropped"
CAT CAT CAT CAT CAT ATTACK CAT CAT
"I'm not here to talk about Dream vs Gumball situation, there is plenty of information about that out there". And there isn't on the sapchat moaning situation? Why would you leave the only confirmed true drama part out of the video? What is even the point then you greasy blue balling halfman? God I hated this one
Apparently the VA is pansexual so the slur he said was perfectly fine. The slur in question btw was "Faggot", before you panic that I said that, I like men.
Getting into a slap fight with a drunk rando is not abuse tf
nicholas was a minor when that was filmed as well, which is weird you’re drinking with minors. one of the slurs he said he can also technically say, that’s why nobody really gives a fuck, a drunk high 19 year old acting like one? holy shit!!
Dublin burnt yesterday
I remember seeing this start. It was so fucking trivial at first then went completely sideways, lol.
neurodivergent people and the lgbt community giving gumball the permission to call dream slurs
Not gonna lie, if he never did his face reveal he would have been a better and peaceful creator till now
The dream moaning was an unpleasant surprise 😭😭😭
Calling dream a narcissist is absolutely wild I don't think you understand the extent of damage actual narcissists do
Bruh ever since Dream revealed his face all he got is more drama and more cringe
This comment just field of the war,  i don't care if dream or cantu is right or wrong i like to stay neutral in this situation
happy thanksgiving.. in other words: happy stealing an entire nations land
Another person that had mental health issues before and after becoming "famous" on the internet it made it so much worse.  Oh no, my suprise
i was not ready to hear moans here
Dream is a nasty person for doing that
Didn't dream admit sending the moaning video. Didn't he just say he sent it to his ex which was proven false and said it was "revenge p0rn" even though he sent it to a minor?? Disappointing video
People still defending dream when he unintentionally confirmed the moaning video by calling it "revenge porn"
well the 5:10 scream remind me of LInk
Is no one gonna talk about how if those voice recordings were truly dream, then we all just heard him.. 🤢
I mean its really discriminatory to not allow miners to sext with Dream. They have a right so explore mancaves aswell!
u obviously never talked to a female
That Dream snapchat is 100% fake, sad if people believe it.
6:21 i was eating food bruh
5:10 A perfect expression to this video
A kidney stone what 😳
I miss technoblade :(
I don't like you very much Charlie
What a sad world we live in.
Stop reminding us of Shane Dawson's poor cat...
6:19
charlie you going to hell for letting us hear the audio 💀
I'm surprised Charlie thinks sending a moaning message to someone is unbelievable. He has several videos on cringe and awful exes that would definitely do that. They don't even have to have ever been in a relationship.
I wish I could live by getting high, putting on a white t shirt and talk about some shit, I’d die so happy
what's crazier to me is that the dream guy's post has 18.6M views, that is insane
Can't believe we got a Charlie moaning clip before gta 6
I couldnt stop laughing
Dream has confirmed that it is 100% him in that clip moaning by calling it "revenge porn" in his Twitter post about the situation.
Sending a moaning video especially to a mommy Dom on certain discord servers? Yes Ehm could never imagine doing that haha haha. Fuck I need a Mommy dommy
6:19 i’m hard
Just an average day
I thought he was done for some time ago when all the cheating has come out...
Im just laughing about how dream really is hated cuz he tried to divert attention to Cantu's alleged assault and bigoted rant and the memes that spawned is just dream getting beat up by gumball😂
The guy who faked his way to fame got more allegations? No wayyy
The cryaotic similarities run deeper than we thought methinks
Damn right i had this Charlie guy moistcrotekol or something sending me stuff about buying gold on whatsup.. blocked him..
0:00 Floofa snoot
dream just cant stop getting into something it hasnt even been a year yet and here he is making the rounds once again
I’m glad we get to watch the downfall of dream in real time :)
I don't know man, filming someone who is high and drunk to use it as a weapon is just fucking deplorable
you know it’s over when you become super defensive over an individual calling you a pdf file
5:10 I did not expect to see Charlie try to go Super Saiyan
Idk how you losers even give af 😂 I only watched this because I see that stupid dream guy everywhere all the time.
Isnt it fake they faked everything i just saw it on twitter on how they lied and did it because tgey wanted to see drama
Ever since I found out he cheated those minecraft speedruns, I knew he was a shady fellow.
Almost failed nnn when Charlie started moaning
why do all the big youtubers always have embarrassing and/or life altering controversies
This video has insane clip potential
The moaning video sounded like a wet dream
gumball waterson is insane
Why are there so many pedophiles?
"It's so hard" "It just keeps coming out" *audio clip of Charlie fake moaning*  Gah the memes write themselves in this one
the craziest part of this is that most of twitter is saying things like “he confirmed it” “there’s proof” and neither are true at all, their source is other people saying the same thing. dream is incredibly cringy and weird but there really is no proof at all
Dream drama is a nightmare: I sleep
Meanwhile me: who’s dreamer?
A new dream "drama"? Oh, how exciting. Everyone here probably cares so much
daddy
Maybe Dream hires a PHD in Physics  in order to debunk the claims.
Charlie is by far the best news to show
"Let me provide an opinion on a situation that has no factual basis but present it like I'm certain on few points because I just have a hunch." Perfect for a few views on everything I ever cover. Lol
It's a nightmare...
6:19 December 1st
6:19 lost nnn
“Yes, I slapboxed you in front of the hoes” 💀💀💀💀💀
Gumball Waterson is the fuckin shit now
Charlie is literally just the internet’s Judge, and EVERYONE is the Jury
Just when I think this year has stopped throwing curve balls of drama, we get this.
I have experienced a few girls wanting moaning snaps but obviously never done it and I can’t imagine it’s a common thing for guys too do or for girls to ask for
when i search dream this is the first thing that come up after his channel
I must be Charlie's oldest listener at 43??? It's funny to hear about this Internet beef, but I'm so glad I don't know who any of these people are unless he's spoken about them before.
if ik much about cartoon network is that there is alot of pedophilia behind the scenes so no surprise dream was there
for me the big issue with all the anti dream evidence is the fact that a LOT of it is super clearly and badly faked making it really hard to give any sort of trust to the more trustworthy stuff, but that is 100% the point since his fans have a history of actually admitting to faking that kind of stuff then "debunking" it with solid proof that it was fake (since they themselves created the fake stuff) then going see this set of super creepy texts/vids/whatever is fake so ALL of them must be fake. then his other fans that only know about the debunking and never heard about the confession to faking it just to prove it false start attacking anyone that says anything about the original much worse evidence that might be real. and then you have the anti-dream-stan-stans that have made it their mission in life to ruin dream who are on the other side of the river ALSO throwing mud into the water meaning at this point there very well could be some good solid proof that dream did something but its been buried under people faking things to prove things other people faked to prove something someone else faked is in fact fake.
I saw it on twitter and when you went to show it I had to skip it. I miss who I was before I heard that.
Penguinz0 moan reveal
Definitely not common to send vids like that there was a girl that asked to send her shit like that tho and i was like nahh im good
i dont do thank giving
to me it seems like everyone on tik tok and twitter just want dream to be a pedophile at this point
06:20 I’m so glad I know what Charlie sounds like in bed now
Hold on a sec. Dream got physically and verbally assaulted by a drunk dude, filmed it for proof (which is a fair thing to do in that situation) and somehow HE'S the guy in the wrong? Wtf is wrong with twitter? 😂😂
Charlie admidit you are the one who sent those moans to that kid 🤣
Wow another minecraft youtuber being a pedo who could’ve guessed
The only thing dream can win is minecraft
Talk about Josh Giddey if you have a chance. Karl Malone 2.0
Man this is getting so bad dream might be known as a drama magnet instead of a minecraft youtuber  I hope dream can get through this
Absolutely crazy considering the kid was 19 at the time, so under the legal age of drinking, was drunk thanks to Dream supplying him with alcohol and was having a terrible manic episode and was probably at a very low point of his life. And dream thought “yeah, this will totally make everyone like me.”
dream the minecraft cheater
Things I needed to hear this year: Zheani's new Ep. Things I didn't need to hear this year: Dream moaning.
Charlie went through René Descartes i think therefore i am i am phase.
oh yes cat in the beginning
He has mentioned those snapchat clips as revenge corn, and I am unsure if someone who isn’t in that video would call it that if it wasn’t them
I wonder how the timeline where most known influencers arent narcissistic weirdos is
was that guy actually orgasming when passing the kidney stones screaming? I thought he was peeing what the heck
"dream has been anything but silence" and "on twitter" is a matchless iconic duo, the guy's life would be so much more happier if he uninstall twitter from his phone
The thing that made me raise an eyebrow was the fact the dream called this "revenge porn". It makes it sound a lot like the audio is real at least.
My favorite "Gaming" video of the day.. thanks youtube
I also came for the cat in the thumbnail
It’s all been downhill since the cursed face reveal
Nicholas Cantu is a neurodivergent autistic person, who was not only drunk but high. and for the slurs, he’s also part of the LGBTQ (not sure if he’s gay bi or what)
I feel like there are ppl out there actively trying to paint certain ytbers in a bad light
6:16 thank you so much for the representation and many more examples, not just that one, really appreciate it
Honestly, dream is completely innocent but the way he tries to defuse any rumours by stooping to the avg twitter user's level and arguing with them is extremely hilarious and stupid.
Dream who?
6:20 now your moan is going to go places
I appreciate you mentioning the fact that there is so much non-provable accusations. Like I dislike dream just as much as the next guy, but when false accusations are being created, and treated as fact, that could lead to other creators receiving similar treatment. The world, especially Twitter, is a fucking wild place.
At this point I'm ready to argue Dream is genZ's Chris Chan
Thanksgiving meat dreams.
5:00 dream has actually confirmed that the moaning was him on his priv twitter, but says that it was sent to an overage friend
Everyone loves these vids, but he’s made a whole video slandering someone’s name on a 10 second low quality Snapchat recording without a face. When are people going to stop treating Charlie as a god and can do no wrong. These videos are straight up lazy
I surprised people still give a shit about him after it was proven beyond a doubt he cheats at video games. Not only that, he spent a long ass time denying it, sending his fans after people, changing his story, and finally trying to gloss over it.  Him being a pedophile is not only easily seen, it's practically the next step of his evolution. First you get a whole fuck ton of kids watching him because of his content, then you get them to idolize him, he isn't in a long ass relationship with females of his age, and finally he thinks he can get away with anything after getting away with cheating in video games. You're telling me that he is the guy who is the exception? Damn, guess Dream is the 1 in 10,000 YouTubers accused of sexual shit that was proven to NOT be true.  Please. Dude is sexually talking with minors. If he isn't taken off the internet now, he's going to just go further.
Who tf has a phisycal fight with a person, and then gets into an uber with them, while having enough money to *JUST GET ANOTHER UBER*
Pyro got to it first
all youtubers touch kids, do illegal shit or have dark secrets, the question is not if, but when will they get exposed, even you charley, one day will come when ppl will discover something about you and want to cancel your ass
Guess his Username and and profile picture isn't the only thing he got inspired by cryaotic for.
Lol that snapchat video was definitely made by some weird kid, who even uses snapchat nowadays in the first place
Step 1 to solving it all:  Ignore everything.  Step 2. enjoy life.
Hasn't gumball had five different voice actors? I'm going to have to do my research to find out which one he was. Not that it changes the story I'm just curious. ...... Also about the moaning video yes strangers on the internet to send sometimes 😢.
THAT'S WHAT THE POINT OF THE MASK ISSSS!!!!
Ireland Riot
Dublin Riot
Irish Riots
Irish Riots
Finally, the word of Jesus is here.
Everything crazy lately
My day was officially ruined when Charlie played Dream moaning clips
In the end Nicholas did admit to some of the things so even then he's alot better than dream, also can't wait for another YouTuber apology video
Dreams a sub
Exactly what I said Charlie there’s no evidence this was dream, just some guy moaning to someone
I didn't need to hear dream moans
Average dream shenanigan 💀
Perfect intro bruther 😂
gumball vs dream was not on my bingo card
What dream needs to do is: stop complaining stop arguing with the twitter species stop saying “he’s making a video” stop going on twitter stop taking joke accounts seriously  If he wants this to stop and go away JUST MAKE AND RELEASE THE VIDEO soo fucking stupid dude, it’s not that hard to use common sense
😂 living for this
You know for sure that Charlie screaming and moaning will be memed to oblivion
I had a handful of dreams about having sex with my mother when she passed in 09. Had a an incest porno addiction ever since. Thankful for Bettie Bondage mom porno ever since. Sorry, didn't watch the vid here, just flying off the handle with the title lol Hope you enjoyed!
Vid won’t load. Translation, Hoes: slap boxed
Imagine how few views this would get if YouTube didn’t let you see how long ago a video was posted. Everyone would just assume this was months ago and wouldn’t click XP
Has anyone told you your eyebrows on fleek?
I also realized this but believed it cause. who wouldn’t
i mean what do you expect from a guy that has narcistic personality disorder and cheating in video games, they always get lock up for pedophilia
Everything seems like Dream is a shithead, a bad person, and a social nightmare of a human being, but probably not a criminal or anything like that.  He's an asshole. A huge one. Probably not a groomer though.  He's had plenty of shit takes, supported a lot of really bad things, and is, genuinely, a scumbag who doesn't care who he hurts so long as it benefits him. That's why he loves the parasocial relationship he has with his fans, he wants worship. He probably doesn't have NPD but he is an honest to god narcissist.  He has routinely spouted thousands of paragraphs to debunk anything against him, even when that thing is someone just not liking him. He cheated his speedrun, and lied about evidence to fix it. He gets constantly roasted on Twitter, and spins threads about why everyone's subjective opinion of him is wrong.  People want to see him fail, because he's insufferable, so its easy to want him to be criminally evil so that everyone will finally shut up about him and he can just be silent. It's the iShowSpeed situation, the Sneako problem. They suck, they're bad people, they're insufferable, you *want* them to just do something criminal and face massive punishment for it. You want the catharsis, the schadenfreude.  So people make shit up and hope everyone hates him for it. He probably didn't, he just sucks.
that dude talking shit to dream looks like screech
Hate to see Dream being treated like a villain yet again, thankfully this time the line was crossed and he is preparing a proper response vid. Long overdue but still a very promising change.
i needa dirty talk lesson from charlie
Always the Minecraft YouTubers.
Dang Dream is Taking things to a New level.
3:55 I AINT NEED TO HEAR THIS
This dream hate is pretty pathetic. Look at all these emos in the comments. No rational logic at all just emotion
"That sounds more like a Shane Dawson moan" PLEASE.
Not defending Dream but holy shit it's crazy how Twitter blows everything out of proportion.  If Dream was filming someone getting jumped by 5 people they would turn it against him 1000%
still remembered the days when dream was still masked and everyone eas fucking in a catatonic craze with it, now look at him now fallen in to deprevity
I for one, cannot wait until this 6:19-6:24 clip grace me as a meme in random videos.
5:04  ambatukam
"Why doesn't Dream just ignore accusations of rape, grooming and so forth that affects his life?" I swear, everyone on both sides are absolutely fucking braindead here.
I legit thought the moans were going to be funny over the ones. But that sh*t was far too real. What's his @ though
@6:18 lulz
Well damn, I could see all the minecraft youtubers distancing themselves from him in the past year or so, and now I 100% understand why. It's not just that he's insufferable.
Skeeter Jean's about to have money shootin out his pockets if this is real
Allegations don't mean anything without evidence. You can put any audio you want over the video, in fact, it does sound fake because it doesn't sound like it's coming from the phone
6:19 your welcome
Dude should have just kept his face hidden. Just looking at him i could have told you that he was sketchy.
Need a solely IO update asap! Grown so much and so beautiful! Awesome to see after how small it all started!
are you gonna cover Colleen balingars second apology video? She made another one like two days ago
What in the.... Wut du hell bluddddd...... Wtf was that moan!!!!!
I want to kill myself after hearing the moaning video
You know dude had his Homelander moment seeing the internet siding with the blackout drunk actor saying slurs and talking about how he’s like a god amongst men or whatever over him.
The only dream in existance is golden finger, uh sory holy cross shiny not too sharp not too((( fond x:::
Gumball vs dream is a silly thing to say outloud
A
R rated scooby doo: 6:19
I remember awhile ago dream making a side comment about talking to fans on snapchat. I've never written someone off quicker.
If you just opened the video, just go to 6:19 to save time.
under dream dream theres stan dream ? bit fishy as to why there are dream accounts, however who still uses snap lol
Tho I believe in innocent till proven guilty. Tho this seems like a regular occurrence for dream. Maybe there’s a lot of people against him. But it doesn’t help his case just ranting and raving on X instead of posting the video
My parrot died on thanksgiving.
He is a huge creep
6:18 clipped
I shitted
why do people even obsess over this uninteresting guy lol
Sheeesh
If Dream is the one recording Nick, and eventually posted it to Twitter that's pretty low. Hell, even if he didn't he apperently used it against him for some reason. The guy is obviously out of his mind from the drugs and alcohol, and doesn't really mean what he says.
dreams just a freak
You need to talk about josh giddy next
Someone clip Charlie out of context please 🤣
how is it thanksgiving i thought you were joking. thanksgiving is in october????
Critikal and Pyro fighting for most original title
Imo stop giving attention to cheaters
i have been without internet for 10 days and I return to see this
Goddammit that moaning portion came on the wrong time, I have a lot of explaining to do to my mom 😓
6:20 is going to be an out of context clip for sure 😂
This is why I’m glad I never used twitter that whole space is bias, your allowed to hate dream but gumball is an actual piece of human waste and honestly if there gunna deplatform anyone it should probably the anti-somatic cartoon cat or both who gives shit
Meh!
Omg lmao
cat cam?
I'd feel bad if I knew who that is. Poor guy! Or not.
There’s some sick woman in here that got off on you saying all that princess shit😭😂
Each time Dream has come into my feed it's never been good, first it was his bat shit crazy fans wanting to build a rocking chair out of his body parts and now this.  I got so fed up that I said something that got me suspended from Twitter
streamers need to stop meeting strangers.. take a note from actors
cat !
Despite this being such a lukewarm nothing take on the situation, something about the way you talked about the whole thing really bothered me, and I couldn’t figure out why until I remembered the ‘not like other girls’ phase I had back when I was a tween. Allow me to explain.  You open up the actual discussion of events by talking about Dream and his relation to his fans, specifically the part where a lot of his fans skew younger, yet he still posts thirst traps which is something you personally find uncomfortable. That because of this, it gives people the ok to assume shit about him, and that it ‘makes sense’ that people would immediately believe grooming allegations. That the ‘believability’ of these claims hold some sort of perceived merit by default based solely on the fact that Dream posts pictures of himself looking hot in public.  It brings me back to my ‘not like other girls’ phase, where any woman wearing skimpy clothing was ‘asking for it’. Where any girl who cared about her looks was immediately perceived as lesser; a hoe, a ditz, a whore - perhaps even a narcissist. That because they chose to look a certain way, that any harm done to them was their fault, and they even perhaps deserved it.  This is not okay.  Nobody is asking for it. Nobody deserves to be harmed over baseless assumptions. Being sexually attractive in public is not grounds for belittling, harassment or disgusting rumors being spread about them. Just because Dream has a younger audience, doesn’t mean he’s suddenly morally obligated to be some sort of sexless being to preserve the purity of the children or whatever. So long as he’s not posting dong or something, he’s allowed to post looking however he wants without creeps making baseless assumptions and accusations.  It can make you uncomfortable. Fine. Whatever. But that does not mean all these people you even admitted were constantly making random accusations to muddy the waters have any merit. These random assholes posting lies to take advantage of a horrible situation purely to further their hate boner for Dream do not deserve any sort of validation. This is not a ‘sounds like the Dream I know’ scenario, because anyone making these sort of mean spirited, malicious assumptions based on surface-level appearances and innocuous actions don’t know shit.  I grew out of my ‘not like other girls’ phase too long ago to be caught up in any ‘person does this completely harmless thing which is vaguely adjacent to this harmful thing so it’s totally fine to assume and accuse’ bullshit. Shit like that is harmful and so beyond okay. It’s something people use to blame victims and excuse horrible actions, and can never be something I approve of, regardless of how this situation turns out in the end.
The Dog just watching the cat, like: 'They can jump on Charlie's desk, but if I jump on it, i'm a bad dog. What is this shit''
6:20, almost made me fail nnn be careful man
Dream deserves everything his community throws his way. Guys a clown, and acts like one too.
You guys give those Twitter bozos so much attention every person can scratch his butt and make whatever accusations to any person's and ruin his reputation without any evidence whatsoever i think its time to stop taking those Twitter scumbags seriously jeez
Nick was literally just on Kill Tony a couple weeks ago and fucking bombed, tf he talking bout doing stand up comedy
Cant wait to see Internet Anarchist and Sunny make a video about "The Downfall of Dream".
its honestly so sad to see dream get piled on just because hating dream is like a trend now, he isnt a predator but now hes just labeled as one because people keep spreading misinformation
Yeah, dream is fcking weirdo
why are people so adamant to cancel dream? 🤣
honestly even if dream is somehow in the right no one will side with him because of how much of a petty disgrace he is, i certainly wont anyways.
finally a source i trust to simplify this for my dumbass
At 6:20 I thought charlie was channeling filthy frank lol
im smoking crack to celebrate
Sounds more like a nightmare… I’ll see myself out now
You should do a video over the Halo 2 speedrunner Ranabundana
6:19 Charlies moan
also btw the slurs nick uses are ones he can reclaim! he’s bi and autistic (the last one depends on if u think the r word is reclaimable, some people do, some people don’t 🤷‍♂️)
What else is new about Dream? He's a fucking nightmare...
Arguing in the internet basically a turn based battle
There's a theory that you stop maturing after the age you first experience fame. Dream is not exactly proving this theory wrong.
Frfr. I dont like Dream AT ALL but I need more than this as a proof bc honestly these aint it.
charlie it's my birthday today :3
Dream needs to learn how to humble himself and shut up and take advice from a lawyer. If he keeps shouting like this he will only make it worse. Most of the proof on here is so obviously fake but he keeps making himself look terrible 😂😂😂
Never heard of this guy. Nothing.
6:18: Dies inside💀
6:19  🥵
There's alot of misinformation in this drama it's crazy lol
Since when did dream become an average Minecraft YouTuber
Oh a minecraft youtuber is a weirdo? Oh well, anyways yall seen that news story about scientists finding out that this one type of echidna isn't actually extinct? Such a W
Was Nicholas Cantu just on Kill Tony a few weeks ago?
Me reading comments while watching the video: Hears Dream, Allegations, and Wrestlemania
ALMIGHTY REVOLVER GOD THEY BRPUGHT IT BACK THE REVOLVERS BACK IN FORTNITE MAKE THE CHILDREN CRY
Florida man 1 watching Florida man 2 critique pedo Florida man who went to high school with a couple of Florida man 1s friends.
Imma do the same thing but make it amboutukam.
Does someone have a clip of when Charlie did his groaning reference. I need it for research purposes
5:10 bro that was so unexpected it made me lose 86% in a geometry dash level HAHAHAHA       (replaying Fingerdash for the curious ones)
6:19 Can’t even edge to this, I exploded immediately!
No offense to indians but the text reads like it was written by an indian
this is why i ignore anything related to dream as much as possible. The only thing I ever get annoyed about is when people ruthelessly make fun of his appearance like what he looks like is relevant.
The gossip toxic train 😂😂😂
charlie i think you just need to do a littttle more diving, you just dipped your toes in the water and called it quits.  #1 dreams response never denied the videos as proof, in fact he confirmed it and deemed it “revenge porn”  #2 he tried blackmailing cantu w that video that was recorded a YEAR AGO, in order to make himself the victim to distract from the allegations  #3 i feel like dreams response to everything from making walls of texts and claims he will make a video on this and feeding into the bait, is childish, which really puts a spotlight onto possibly more evidence towards, yeah, with the talking and thirst trapping his audience of kids to acting like a child himself ..  spells out disaster bc he will try and find like minded people to himself, which would be minors
anotherone bites the dust....
Dream is trash.
based gumball
0:04 why no gib dog pey 😢
It's the mask. Cry used the same mask years ago and look how that turned out..
Even games do this such as call of duty and grand theft auto they know a lot of kids are their audience so i don't know how this is worse...
Dream had it coming to him. Dream did rig democracy once. So the hate, regardless if Dream is right or wrong, is absolutely understandable.
It would've never gone this far if dream didn't send esay to every single tweet against him,  he should've ignored them after his first reply and he should've just made a video to reply to it at the beginning of this thing
We need a Josh giddy reaction
Penguinz0 outta context is gonna have a fun time with this one 6:19
Considering how dream has been acting for a long while none of this would surprise me, especially the moaning on Snapchat
That’s what the point of the mask is….
THE CHARLIE'S CAT HAS MADE ITS PRESENCE KNOWN WE ARE BLESSED
Idk why this is such a big deal
i been waiting for this vid 😈
Don’t you have like Jesus thinks to do on thanksgiving?
The dream drama confuses me SO MUCHHHHH it’s like the lamest metaverse of all time but like I’m kind of invested a little?? I just wanna know the truth 😭
Based gumball is actually tough
4:05   What the fuck  Seriously what the fuck
Im sitting at my kitchen counter eating left over Thanksgiving dinner after getting off work at midnight. I really didn't need dream moaning to be playing on my speaker rn
3:51 "Here the evidence for that" Nope! i take my earphone off. I dont want to hear dream moaning ever
All the memes on this shit are so funny tho, so I’m kinda enjoying this also I’m on the side of  gumballs va  rn just from what I’ve seen so far
Nah they could have said anything in the chat
Clout is worse than fentanyl and heron.
It doesn’t happen to Dream. It’s a bunch of narc-assists. It’s like smaller narcs sourcing from IRL people, converting it to internet bullshit, strap it to Dream. It’s a con… or entertainment.
I’m so excited for dreams new video discussing the situation- it’s gonna be so funny lmfao
crazyy woahh oooh
The second audio kinda sounds like him a little bit to me idk tho the vids are kinda hard to tell but honestly I feel he is definitely guilty of dming fans weird shit without a shadow of a doubt. Now if its grooming or if they were underage then I’m not so sure. Its all kinda jumbled that its really hard to tell. Especially since dream also refused to provide evidence against his previous grooming allegations from a year ago or something. His video better have solid proof cause honestly this man has lied about stupid shit like minecraft, this makes it hard to just “trust his word” when it comes to something this serious. I kinda doubt he’ll actually drop the video but I think it’s important to address this shit.
Fun fact: the first word of the first comment on charlies channel is turd, and the last word of the most recent comment is jumpscare. Thus creating the phrase "turd jumpscare"  (Correct as of 2:27 AM EST)
Nah wait till Bella Poarch finds out I swear weren’t they dating like a month ago😭
5:11 SUPER CRITIKAL
Yeah don’t think it’s a Maranda Sings level of expose. It’s just the face reveal…
I did not expect charlie to play the video that shit was a jumpscare 😭
You did not have to include the moaning audio😭just censor it like you would any other video and describe what's happening
Dream is on the list of YouTubers I feel will come out being a pedophile one of these days this is helping that statement
Very interesting situation. I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if that really is dream in the snaps. But there really isn’t much evidence to support that it’s actually him.
Moist I believe there is also the fact that the voice actor who played gumball is 20 or like 19 so if he was cross faded the dream filming a underage person high and drunk is illegal and in the law I think they will make dream liable for it but idk cause I don’t care what happens to dream ( I don’t hate nor do I like and nor will I ever like him cause he sounds like a awful person)
Who the fuck cares and why did I just watch a video about that?!
6:18 bout to fail this month 😔
Nah. People in these comments are brain dead.
I find it disgusting that I used to like this guy a few years ago. I'm dissapointed in myself.
So the one meme where he went to chile because the age of consent was like 12 or 15 might be true? Damn 💀
Dream admitted to the video being real, but lied about who he sent it to as an attempt to try and throw people off
7:44 It's probably important to note that Dream claims a) he wasn't the one filming and b) Nicholas asked them to start filming. But it's still Dream's word vs Nicholas' with no proof (yet) either way.
Dream vs Gumball is the fight of the century
Oh my god the cat and dog are so cute :,)))
Dammit Charlie! Why are you so biased against miners?  This ain't the first time either!  Miners need love too! They work hard!  I guess next you'll be railing against oil rig workers!  Elitist prick!
Didnt Dream legit admit to the moaning; cuz im pretty sure he did
Charlie:Dream Situation is Crazy  Pyro:Dream Situation is insane
i literally said dream looked like a ped0 when his face reveal dropped and then i see all this drama about him grooming and being a  ped0
I have heard dream moan.  I can never be the guy who didn't hear that..    GIVE ME MY INNOCENCE BACK  *G I V E   I T   T H E   F U C K   B A C K*  Also, DC Inconsistancies in a nutshell: 1:11
AI Moaning gets out of Hand :D
I've been saying for years that lonely schizo posters literally made it a national pastime to see who could throw the most baseless, fictional shit possible out there hoping it sticks, just to cause chaos, because they think cancelling people is a literal sport. It's why I just stopped paying attention to 99.9% of the drama I see online, because I know it's almost guaranteed at this point that at least part of what I'm reading is some weirdo's fanfiction that they posted for clout. I can't care anymore. Talking about this specific internet-ism is the extent of how much I can care about twitter drama anymore. 😮‍💨
Is it just me or am i slowly realizing most pedos are these youtubers with a younger audience?
honestly this video was such a let-down. charlie u spent 4/5 of the video talking about the “DREAM DID WHAT” a situation something that doesnt have alot of proof of. (that im aware) and the other half you barley even talk about the gumball/dream situation and BARLEY even touching the surface of it the gumball vs dream has MUCH more evidence than the “DREAM DID THAT” allegations. its sad to see youtubers talk about this situation and act like its not a big deal at all but when a female streamer starts to get into conflict its a 15 min video going tho depth of everything and number 1 trending on twitter. instead when a popular minecraft streamer gets outed for being a groomer for like that 5th time this year people stay quiet. odd.
You should talk about Josh Giddey next...
Someone needs to reverse search the video 😰
Wheres the cat
I Know Know Its hard to do math butA, If you broke then say so.
I definitely sexted some things I'm not proud of. However, it's hard to believe that that's legitimate. I've had a lot of weird requests from women and none of them have been. Send me fake moaning noises on a black screen. That being said, I have no idea who dream is never heard of until this video, so maybe he is that cringy
nice cats
Guy uses Snapchat thats evidence enough he’s a wrongen
charlie had me giggling and kicking my feet with this upload
Bro is a sexual monster
Dog
Glad to see IO again
I clicked this video because everytime somebody talks about Dream it seems to be a new thing and I have genuinely no idea what's going on, good to know that my confusion is justified lol
This video was pretty mid honestly feels like a video that should of just waited till more info Very “this happened but not enough info anyways see ya!”
Im not gonna lie idk whether hes guilty or not but hes legit gonna be bullied to the point of topping himself. Hes young, hes recognisable and this wouldve been so much easier if he kept his face hidden. Unfortunately, Ur guilty until proven innocent and even then ur not out of the water on the Internet
i hope dream had what techno did
It is just a Loop of accusations that Dream is right now stuck inside. Dream will eventually completely go away not only in relevancy but also as a person.
Why the fuck were they in a car together? Why gumballs voice actor in particular?
Its absolutely disturbing if it's true, my youngest cousins have been fans of his for a while, you think you have a grasp of who someone is and when the truth comes out its extra gross, i guess its true that you never know who someone truly is until its way too late
i think u can use ur intuition on this one
The cat getting petted and the dog looking got me in the beginning like charlie he wants love too 😂
Is this guy just addicted to being under controversy? Are we sure that this "2nd hand claim" wasn't made by Dream himself?
sounded like no face from spirited away
[Insert Streamer/Youtuber/Content Creator here]'s Situation are my least favorite Charlie videos
obviously some random ass drama with dream HAS to be more complex than the fucking entirety of the fnaf timeline 💀
Now that I have audio of Charlie moaning I can start my own fake allegators
This is such poor video 😭 it was confirmed dream DID send it, its just whether if it was to a MINOR or a OVER AGE ex … why are you trying to paint dream as this person who gets hate because people simply dont like him when you know that isnt true. Please research more on dream and realize that he has done various things… such as being a racist , housing his friend whos an abuser and during the same time period , kicked a person off the smp after they were exposed for being a gr//mer and was still helping his friend ? He also defended a friend of his for animal abuse, and said he throws his cat out of annoyance multiple times . He also says cantu is ableist because he said the r slur towards him when dream has also said it? Youre defending this person who took a video of a vulnerable 19-20 year old who was drunk and probably having a manic episode and only showed it AFTER cantu posted about dream being a weirdo and a gr//mer..  Charlie i like you and your content but this is such a poorly made video 😭.. even if you’re neutral on this topic about dream being a p3dophile you have to admit the guy is a creep, narcissistic petty manchild.
I seen that Nicolas dude on Kill Tony a while back and he tried his hand at stand up. It wasn't good but he ended winning over Tony and anyone who is a fan of it knows that doesn't happen often. So Tony for anyone not familiar gives out small/medium/large joke books an various great other things like golden ticket to perform anytime on the show. Offers to join him to do sets at shows sometimes even. An sometimes regular-ship if a spot opens up. Well tony went from hating this kid to really liking him by the end giving him a joke book. Apparently the kid had been hit by his dad as well so exposing some realness made him likable to Tony. An I even found myself liking the kid he had a good attitude an personality. So weird to see this having no idea who he was an find out hes a fairly famous voice actor. An then it develops where I see this whole situation.
I’m losing my mind at everyone just calling him Gumball. Even dream himself “then fucking Gumball comes at me” lmaooo
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you’ll ever hear. All of us, without exception, have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). And because God is just and will not let sin go unpunished, the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). As a result, that means that as sinners, we will all get what we rightly deserve: eternal punishment, which is called the second death. But the good news is that God is loving and does not wish that any should perish but that all would come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). So He made a way for us to be saved and now graciously offers you the free gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ (Romans 6:23), all while justice is done. He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on behalf of us and pay for our sins on a cross, and He was then buried and rose again on the third day (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Regardless of who you are or what you may have done, if you believe with your heart the gospel ( ^^ which I just mentioned above) and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, you shall be saved (Romans 10:9,10). Salvation is simple and free. It’s not a 12 step program, and don’t think, as many do, that you just have to be a “good person” or do good works to go to heaven. Salvation is based on what Jesus did, not what you do (Ephesians 2:8,9). Believe in Christ, and you will be saved. “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever should believe in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through Him.” John 3:16,17
One Day, I will be penguinz0's equal. Day: 301
OMG MINECRAFT YOUTUBERS
Stop being so handsome
Happy Thanksgiving everybody
Dream is the new sssniperwolf
Cesspool is the most correct word possible
Minecraft youtubers 🤝 pedophiles
I’m thankful for Charlie fake moaning 🤣🤣🤣🤣
everybody on the internet is a creep these days
6:28 reminds me of pink guy
Hearing Charles trying to moan makes me feel sorry for the cat
6:18 would go great in one of those Crikital out of context vids
5:10 and 6:19 should he in a Penguinz0 without context vid.
Charlie’s moaning at 6:20 sounds like a Banjo Kazooie NPC and nothing can change my mind
Charlie you mean "X", not twitter
Nah I agree. Sending a video with audio of yourself 'moaning' is inconceivably horny stan behavior. If someone asked me to do this I would make it a meme 200% , Imagine sending back a video of Mario's Super Smash Bros KO audio at full blast, that would be amazing.
am thankful for moist
Dream is on watch rn
WHAT THE HELL ??? HELLO WTF
He’s going to try and do what Kwite did I believe.
how do some people get famous, i don't get it
Dream didnt record the video either
That moan scream Charlie did was the most anime ass thing I’ve ever heard
*Thank You For Inspiring Me To Make Videos Again*
kept being distracted by charlies hair
MoistCritikal debut on r/gonewildaudio when
Reminder this dude had a Game awards nominee for content creator of the year
All Dream had to say was "I'm lawyering up" and then these accusations will drop like flies
Holy #### only 10 likes? Is there a glitch or something???
i can’t believe it was all started by gumball and a parody account
Dream admitted that the moaning is him on Twitter
Tbh everyone needs to grow up. And stop trying to cancel drama just cause he is “cringy Mc player “ like okay move on jeez no one in this planet will care soon or later and the gumball drama jeez is more sad then bread falling. Just get over it I can’t stand people at times💀
Whoever the moaning video is, im genuinely concerned people are laughing at the fact that someones sexual content got posted without permission, that is illegal distribution of sexual content. If it seriously IS Dream one crime doesnt make it okay to commit another, it should go to the police not Twitter bffr
About time Charlie made a video on this
I'm noticing a patern of video titles  It's a lot of "_______ situation is crazy"
He's friends with Gumball's VA?
You didnt have to show me that moan video thanks
pet the dog too 😭 +io is vv cute too hehe
Bro Dream had drama with the voice actor of Gumball
Look I wouldn't be surprised if it was confirmed that he is a Pdf ile
shoutout charlie wishing a happy thanksgiving. made me smile
Dream be like: I LOVE MINERS
Not commenting on all the weird pedophile allegations because I know nothing about them. But the drama with the VA is so bullshit. I get he has a platform, but it's common place for people to record people freaking out. There's like whole subreddits related to it, and never once is it "why film it?" I can say with 100% certainty that if the roles were flipped, the VA recorded dream saying crazy things, no one that is currently on the VA's side would be on dreams side even though all the same reasoning would still apply. I understand he gets into stupid drama and says stupid things but I can't imagine a world where he is hated so much for that, that somehow he still loses the public opinion when he is seemingly being berated by a drunk man. Twitter is ridiculous. And this is coming from someone who enjoys some of his content but hasn't really interacted with his content in a while and don't feel any emotional reason to defend him besides the fact that it's just obviously bullshit.
I haven't spent thanksgiving with anyone in 3 years, life of a trucker for me, the unseen sacrifice no one knows is being made
Why no one is held accountable for falsely accusing people of heinous crimes?
to see charlie climax skip to 6:19
The thing that I find quite suspicious is how Gumball got into this situation in the first place. Who recorded him while he was saying that nonsense and how did dream get a hold of that clip. What can never be certainly said is if dream is responsible for making gumball drunk and making him say those things
Dream can’t help himself. Even when he’s in the right he whingers and moans on Twitter until he becomes the one in the wrong
Hey baby
Hello moist man!
Of course charlie defending his pedo friends
Bruh I did not pay attention and had this vid playing in a separate window. Those moans were at the worst time for my family to hear out my computer at thanksgiving 💀
cat: this stupid cable is in my way  dog: how the fuck come does the cat get to be on the desk but I can't?
Dude. I literally just got home from seeing dream at a kava bar near my house. A whole group of people with me saw him there too and we tried to do a giant bit that none of us knew who he was but he caught a few people taking pictures of him, and I have videos of him as well. It’s insane lmfao I can’t believe he was in my hometown on Thanksgiving.
Happy thanksgiving everyone
Dream trying to ruin gumballs life and it getting thrown into his face is one of my favorite things to happen on the internet
"Dream can you just shut the fu-" Dream: "NU-UH!"
the amount of hate dream gets is unnatural, despite him being a narcissist (it started before he showed his colors on twitter). these haters should genuinely be put under a microscope and studied if the only thing they do every day is coming up with increasingly stupid ways to get dream out of the internet. i genuinely wonder what happens if he actually leaves. will they move on? disappear in their own bubble of now non-directed hate? pretend dreams still exists so they can still hate on him?
Dream has like a wall of dedicated fans we cannot walk through if we made a hate comments about him. The fact that GUMBALL broke that wall for us to go through for us to finally put dream’s ego down is crazy.
2:08 🤮 not food poisoning it’s people poisoning and now I can’t eat. Fucking anxiety and giving a fuck tears up the digestive tract my friend
THATS WHAT IM SAYING W PENGUINZ0
Im gonna be real, I don’t know anything about dream, or anything about nick, so I just think the situation is funny as fuck lmao
The dream situation is “crazy” but the pokimane situation is “horrible” ?? Lol why you dislike pokimane so much
Awesome cat
6:19 pink guy charlie?
0:09 ❤ look at how healthy and beautiful 😻 i O 🖖🏻🤘🏻🤟🏻🫵🏻💪🏻🫶🏻✌🏻👋🏻🤙🏻🖕🏻🫵🏻✌🏻🤌🏼👌🏼🫰🏻✍🏻👁️🧠👁️
Its kinda of annoying that people think they cant dislike dream but also be aware that the allegations are just allegations, gumball actor was completely in the wrong he literally tried to deny he would say the things he said.  Its bizarre to me just because you dont like him doesn't mean every allegation is true or every arguement hes in he lost
Nickelodeon vs Dreamworks?
he confirmed it was him tho. he said someone release revenge pron of me.
it's always the Minecraft youtubers that become weirdos or pedophiles.
Charlie hasn't experienced the pain of being sent a moaning video on snap. sweet summer child
🐐🐐🐐🐐
my brother in charles christ, you have no idea what horny dudes on snapchat or anywhere for that matter will do this day in age
I thought dream was a little kid, didn't expect him to be an adult.
7:16 bro voiced gumball and a ninja turtle and is talking like he’s Kanye
my conclusion is the same as always: dream has no idea what hes doing and is a disaster of a man. but hes not much more than that. hes kinda just a slightly below average guy who got an insane dose of young adult fame and snorted that shit like drugs and it DESTROYED his brain. like idk hes not necessarily a GOOD GUY but like neither would you be if what happened to him happened to you. its just insane how no one seems to consider the context when talking about this guy. im not trying to defend him im just sick of the insane cancel culture around him. leave the guy alone he just needs some weed and therapy or some shit. my guy just needs to spend a year in the woods. hes not evil or some kind of monster hes just a fucked up kid.
Dreams initial response is like the polar opposite of the Kwite allegations. While Kwite sat back and bided his time creating something to utterly raze the allegations and his accuser with only a short-term detriment to his reputation, Dream is only hurting himself more and more as he prioritizes arguing over getting his response out, possibly to the point where a non-insignificant amount of people will just ignore the proof and bully him until the end of time.  Also, I never thought about his Twitter arguing being narcissism, but thinking and hearing about it makes so much sense. How dare the plebeian BallsLover69 be critical of the mighty Minecraft king Dream?  Edit: also pretty sure the Dream v. Nicholas Cantu thing was started by Nicholas replying to a FAKE Dream account, so it wasn’t even Dream that was being insulted, and yet his still decided to argue.
The timeline really caved in when he face revealed
I always knew, dream was cringe…my instinct was right! (And i never seen a full dream video…)
Imagine this is all fake
This whole situation funny af.
Screw Dream
My ears were violated is all imma say
I watched the AWO gumball in french, so I don't really know this dude. But still Fuck Dream
YES I was waiting with such excitement for Charlie to cover this 😭
0:09-0:11 dog
Dream cheating world records  = getting his karma IMO
Gumball asked the other guy (not Dream) to film all that…  gumball was just on his better than thou rant and thought it was great content, I could barely make it through that video it was so obnoxious, idk how people are ok with cantu after that tbh… idc what either of them have done in the past or present but if Cantu was picked apart as much as Dream has been by others I don’t think this would have had the same result in twt or even have gotten this big…
every 3 years, people take a gander to tear down dreams reputation and background.... its like a holiday!
6:11 I mean, EDP did break new ground by sending pics of his crap, so Idk anymore
I can't breathe.... with this news
Gumbal waterson has entered the chat
happy thanksgibing moist!!!
High quality cat content
this is why i don't have a twitter. its just toxic
I'm spending my holiday homeless and alone. Hope the rest of you are doing better!
This all would've been avoided if Dream just decided to Stfu
5:12 now that's a memeable face
Playing it was crossing the line, I can’t go back to who I was when, I didn’t hear that moan.
I didn't know what thirst traps were until this video so I consider myself to have been blessed.
I never liked dream to begin with and I don’t see how anyone else did
I think dream did moan into the snapchat to be honest he did it to my niece
If he's so mad and making a video then he definitely planted the claims
Tbh if I was at the party with dream I would do alot more than just a lil slap
Since the whole situation with Johnny Depp, Ive always been very sketical abuse/sexual allegations! Dont believe everything you hear on the internet people, the media cant be trusted anymore! This is why its best to let the professionals and courts handle legal action!
Man, i remember enjoying Dream's videos a long time ago, and now he's tossed his own career straight into the shitter. He, his content, and his fanbase are a nightmare now. With all the drama, cheating allegations that were proven correct, 12 year old stans, and now this, I feel like he almost secretly enjoys being the butt of all internet drama. It always feels like popular YouTubers, especially Minecraft ones, turn out to be sucky people at the end of the day. He's earned the controversy and complaining he's gotten throughout the years, whether he likes it or not.
6:18 memes incoming
Thank you I did, and I hope you did as well
womp womp
Let’s all be real, it was him in the videos like cmon
The moans just ruined the rest of my week
6:18 now we know how charlie moans atleast
Charlie I'm so sorry to tell you, as someone with BOOBS, I have had /many/ men send me unsolicited moaning audios
Dream is older and almost a foot taller than cantu and still got bitched 😭
those moaning videos are dream and he’s admitted to them saying they’re being leaked as “revenge porn” on his private twitter and main twitter thread in the one u put in the video but he’s trying to say it’s being leaked by his ex girlfriend or something which it just wasn’t and he’s lying so
What da dog doin?
Speaking of YouTuber drama, is sssniperwolf still demonetized?
Happy thanksgiving ❤
I don't voluntarily know anyting about dream, but the way the gumball guy says "because you said thats what the mask isssss i think you're a f-" never fails to make me laugh.
5:11
Happy thanksgiving dude hope it was good for you to
Dream is the only man I can think of who has a perfectly set up argument and enough evidence and is still able to lose every argument.
"[Famous Person] situation is [Crazy, Insane, Wild]"
Io looks so adorable!!
charles has obviously never sent a nutting vid with the sound on
Imagine getting home from a wholesome Thanksgiving dinner and you check Twitter the next day to see people on Twitter spending their Thanksgiving family time to post allegations and get caught up in the controversy trying to assist the man who isn't even watching it happen.
remember when dream was actually a respectable content creator
Dream face reveal was the beginning of the end
Yo my thanksgiving was delicious
Why do you people care about this kind of stuff?
Watch 6:19 before you start the video so it’s out of context. I promise you’ll pee yourself
Your playin Minecraft in a cave lookin for diamonds -dream
I don't care about this video or what Dream will say in a future video he's gonna make, both of them can deal with it in court if they choose 😂
Dream asked Twitter what his rap name would be and someone said “MF Groom” lmao I would have deleted my account
Dream moaning? Ew.
Charlie moaning is the most angelic noise I've heard in a while  Edit: I liked my own comment
A new meme format has been born 6:19
CHARLIE I DONT KNOW IF YOU WILL SEE THIS BUT I WENT TO A STORE TODAY AND FOUND A GUY WHO LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE YOU I THINK I FOUND YOUR DOPPELGANGER I ACTUALLY GOT SO HYPED UP, I TRIED TO GET YOUR ATTENTION IN THE THANKSGIVING STREAM BUT IT WASNT WORKING SO HERE, HAPPY THANKSGIVING CHARLIE
"I thought for sure this was leaked audio of Shane Dawson when he did that degenerate shit with his cat"  I'm sorry what
Dream is more to drama than a thanksgiving dinner is to talking politics
What a cute kitty 🥰
Dream had the greatest downfall after face reveal 💀
Happy thanksgiving
Buddy should have kept his mask on lmao, nothing good has come since he removed it it’s like a curse
People rallied behind Cantu because Dream didnt just film the uber ride and then dropped it on the same day, he kept it and waited until Cantu crossed him online. So people think he's planning to use it as a weapon/blackmail.   Cantu is also apparently known to be pansexual and is neurodivergent, and also under 21 when that vid is filmed, so lots of people excused him.  But it def doesnt help that a lot of people alr dislike Dream. If it was any ither cc i'm sure the discourse would be more balanced 😂
All i need to know to pick a side is that dream is a minecraft youtuber. He definitely diddling some kids.
Thank you Charlie, I hope you had a good thanks giving ❤
Hey that dude in the car was on Kill Tony not too long ago
It's so funny that Charlie finds men moaning on the internet unbelievable. As a bio-woman, I've encountered so much 💀💀
Oh god- why’d you make us listen…
I feel some out of context content coming up
Do a video on the Scream 7 drama
I miss Oompa's video when Tara refused to show us the moaning clips
Am I in the minority thinking that the gumball guy was fucked up? The only thing I know is what Charlie showed in this video but like whoever who speaks like him no matter how drunk or high you are you’re just an asshole. If I was drunk listening to someone else babble being a douchebag I’d record it too
6:00 oh charlie, u poor soul..
More kitty plz.
I’m starting to hate this shit
Thankful for all the entertainment and info you've given me as I started watching your channel more and more over the last year. You're a cool dude!
Who’s dream?
Evil villain ass opening
Honestly, half of whats happening in the twitter is dream own fault.
I have received a moaning video from one of my ex's. She thought she knew what men want.....
6:20 P...Pink Guy?
Damn I wanted more Gumball Vs Dream Drama covered but I guess it's not bigger than Dream being a weirdo
Dream really needs to get a job thats not content creation, it's clear that, mentally, having this big of an audience and being on twitter does not suit him and is actively harming him. He needs to grow up, not remain engaging in this embarrassing highschooler drama.
i had a stalker for over a year that would call me constantly and just MOAN like disgusting moans.  my parents have a blocked number and i would think it was them if i answered. scariest shit ever tho
I was trying to avoid listening to that dream audio clip 😢
the moaning 😭
Those dream stans be fuming 💀💀
Sounds like dream is definitely guilty to me.  Yikes
Dream is this gen's Trisha Paytas. Help.
He's a Nonce
Watch Dream hire an astronomer to explain all this stuff.
He srsly should just take a break from the internet he ain’t winning
This is probably The Completionist and Pokimane attacking Dream to take the attention away from their drama. It’s obvious.
Lmao 5:02
Didnt dream cheat in a minecraft challenge? Why should we trust him?
i just started the Video and oh my god the cat is so cuteeeee!
How fast is someone going to clip charlie and make a meme.... haha.... Moist is god tier for the dry sarcasm 😂
Thank god I turned 18 the day this came out🙏 Dodged a bullet there
Wtf is gumball
Internet drama feels like the dumb ass high school drama I hear everyday
I hope this finally gets dream off all platforms he’s the most annoying dude ever
i love u charlie, i was seeing the memes everywhere but i couldnt find shit on it
it was so funny when a dude sent him a "I love miners" Minecraft shirt
Dream needs to grow up, his audience will keep aging out of his content. Eventually he will lose his appeal to his younger audience the older he gets.
When I first heard abt the dream drama I thought “I’ll just find out about it on Charlie’s video whenever he makes one”
Charlie fake moaning gives me life
What is up with this groomer pedo exposing cancel culture it’s getting old and dangerous it’s 99% bullshit I don’t like dream but I’m not gonna jump on the accusation train with no evidence inquisitor ghost offed himself because of this shit and at the end of the day people discovered he was innocent this accusation shit gets people attention that’s why there’s so much “exposing” it’s trial by fire YouTubers and creators become judge jury and executioner it needs to stop
I am definitely thankful on this turkey day for this 5:11 !  🦃🍗
Hey if you got to get off,  you got to get off.
Why anybody still trusts or likes Dream after the whole falsifying a speedrun WR is beyond me, it would have been fine if he had just come out clean about it but the dude went to such lengths to prove his innocence, and it was all dogshit proof, but in the end he didn't even apologize for it and just hoped it would die down and it did.
There are two kinds of people; pdf files and liars.
The vidoes have been confirmed to be real BUT the videos were sent to dreams now ex girlfriend who screen recorded them (whcih screen shots of her recording them have been posted) and (allegedly) she is known for trying to take down content creators this seems very much like revenge 🤷‍♀️
5:10 he's going SUPER SAIYAN
I always knew, hehehe.
Edging to you Charlie ❤
IM GONNA THROW UP
5:10 Here you go
finally someone with a brain thinks the same thing i do about the moan videos
The funny thing with the "Dream vs Gumball" arc, is that Nicolas Cantu is apparently Pansexual and the majority of the lgbtqa+ gave him the F-slur pass because of how Hated dream is. Also to give more context to that situation, that clip was recorded months and months ago, Nicolas was 19, drunk off his ass, and had a manic episode, but this begs the question what was dream doing with a drunk minor?? (By American standards) and Dream Held on to that video to use as blackmail. Yeah Drunk Nick may of said some awful shit, but Dream actively tried to use a drunk minor's episode as blackmail on top of the shit he's already accused of.
While we dont have proof it isn't him nesscasarily. Why would the Internet be go against somebody, who just plays video games. Theres def some allegations that are true
A left wing YouTuber being exposed as a kid diddler? Color me surprised.
One of my friends just saw dream at a Kava bar lmao
Oh my gosh, Charlie, your dog still a Lil fucked up looking but they got so big! Keep feeding 'em well! 💖
the moaning was dream, he called it revenge porn in his tweet implying it is very real
Dream is starting to sound like South Park Al Gore "its super super cereal guys"  Dude it aint that serious. Stop being terminally online and get a life outside of messing with minors.
Yeah the only reason that dream is freaking out and responding to all of these situations like this is because he's a narcissist and he can't control the situation.
The drama is I busted in dreams ass
Yes, happy new England colony day peeps.
No way Leonardo's VA just called himself a Michelangelo...
Haha Gumball beat tf outa Dream💀
Dream called it “revenge porn” so I feel like that confirms it
whyd he start moaning.. i feel violated and my night is ruined
Fluiffer
bro i started screaming in the middle of the airport when charlie did the kidney stones cum impression
I believe dream is a bad person and a narcissist but I don't think he is a groomer/pedo
Am I the only one putting the 5 seconds of Charlies moaning on repeat forever?
Penguinzo moan
cantu had that Dracula flow ngl
Hope he hired some mathematicians for the upcoming video uselessly explaining more drama
Dream admitted on twitter that the moaning clips are him, however, no proof of it being sent to a minor. we just have to wait for his video
6:19 : me in my girls ear (im single and very lonely)
To add to the Nicolas Cantù altercation, people have said that they believe Nicolas was in the middle of a manic episode during the filming and has stated that he was severely intoxicated during the video. Also he’s autistic and queer so the slurs he said are words he’s able to reclaim. not hateful rhetoric whatsoever in my opinion
its crazy how, before his face reveal, ive never even heard of the dudr
I don't like Dream but I will say this anyway. People are making a LOT of assumptions about him from random bits of footage and info. As far as the other allegations go, they are worth dirt unless it can be proven by law. Otherwise it's just weightless accusations to character assassinate or clout chase.
Not really that known.. never heard of him
6:19 amazing
this is so cringe ☠️
What’s funny is that this would actually be a pretty slam dunk case if it weren’t compounded by Dream’s inability to put down the shovel. The other guy in the car comes across as a major fucking loon, so if the recording was posted by pretty much anybody else this video would instead be about a VA getting cancelled. But like always Dream finds a way to dig the grave deep enough to fit himself in it too.
Oh no lol
a lot of these problems would be solved if we just banned anyone under like 17 from being on the internet
So… Twitter being Twitter again?
Dream gets a 20 year old drunk and continues to blame him instead of
Ohhhh the kitty has gotten so big and fluffy
Charlie moaning for us in unironically the greatest 6 seconds of Internet history
Gumball is one of the most reverently treated cartoon series of all time, it's like Venture Bros, there simple aren't detractors. Dream isa guy who got famous because he wasn't good enough at a game for autistic children and he got caught cheating. Just from a clout level, this is a forgone conclusion.
should never reveal that goofy ahh face
I don’t know if he did it, but he’s so annoying enough for me to side with literally anyone else just to spite him
he's 100% gonna reference this video in his own, I can tell you that much.
A.I. in the wrong hands man....some evil stuff.  I'm not sure if this is true or not but that's the danger of fame, it can all be stripped away in one moment.
Can we take a moment to appreciate Charlie's moan at at 6:19?
gumball has lost his mind but that is evil for dream to record him when hes at his lowest
it's also not fair even on side alt account his fans will still follow if your fan base is kids, are you just not allowed to be a adult anymore anywhere and always be family friendly
God. I will never for the LIFE of me understand why someone would be attracted to minors 😒🤢
Bro, I had headphones at max volume during the moaning part 😢
6:15 "some dude moaning would be a jumpscare" well yeah Charlie that's what I felt at 3:59 thanks for that...
5:36 Gengis Swan would write something like that
this is honestly why i stopped interacting with dream’s content. last year, like 2 or 3 girls came out with grooming accusations, it was an absolute mess, no one could tell what was going on. dream didn’t even acknowledge the accusations for days, refused to come out with a firm yes or no answer, and released some lengthy nonsensical rant that literally served no purpose. he keeps finding himself in these situations and keeps digging himself deeper holes. he refuses to be an adult and say “yes i did it” or “no i didn’t” and his insane twitlongers do nothing but muddy the waters. he’s immature, and like charlie mentioned, a narcissist. and it was absolutely exhausting to be a dream fan bc after a while you start to realize that this guy is just a manchild that got too big, too fast
as a former snapchat user, i have been sent absolutely vile shit on snapchat
I guess he should have left the mask on
I LOVE NICK CANTU!!!!!!!!!!!!!
remember when charile wasn't gonna get a cat, now he uses ieo for views what a charile move
Tbh as someone who's reached the lows of lows I can relate to how dream reacts to these situations. I've gotten therapy and I'm getting better but all I use to do was drown in sorrow and that seems like what Dream is doing. I could never handle having alagations like that against me or that much hate.
For Thanksgiving, I made some Focaccia bread that went away really quickly. Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.
Dream More like Nightmare :D
Charlie calls Dream a narcissist, but can we all just acknowledge that everyone hopping on the allegation train is just that much more narcissistic. They will literally go out of their way to try to ruin someone's life for the slightest hint of clout.
Yo I just watched the new dream video its where he gets hunt down by the fbi in Minecraft irl
If he would just shut up, and just don't care because he knows the allegations are not true, maybe he wouldn't have been in all this drama
so we go from the overly messy and confusing open ai drama to the overly messy and confusing dream drama
They added 2 pixel screenshot like it was 2000
he's literally gotten himself into all kinds of twitter shenanigans in 2023
Dark Souls death sounds compilation 6:19
Dream is doing everything to make gumball even more likeable
ive been anticipating this banger
There's quite a couple things wrong with the snapchat clip that is going around that makes me believe that it's edited. I'm not a big snapchat user, but I'm pretty sure you have to touch the screen to view the snap. The camera is also perfectly still and only starts moving when it begins to fade into the next screen which is also pretty suspicious. Also were in the 2020s, there's no reason for it to look like it was taken in the 2000s with its 240p quality. Turn on the goddamn light and make the evidence clear.
5:04 the WHAT
gato :)
Go birds, Keith. Go birds.
I love Shane Dawson catching strays
I now title this drama the Jikishi effect
Massive list of accusations and claims does sound like our forefathers. 😂
no relations
The scheme is a win / win for Dream.  The only way to win is to not play.
when he said "are you feeling it now babe"  I could only think of "are you feeling it now mr krabs?"
Imagine if Nicholas was Gumball and Dream was Darwin. It would be even funnier
Idk who tf is this dude is.
(GULP), Not to be rude, but. Don't Tell Me That Dream Did Something Bad?
I think it's safe to say that Dream has reached Lolcow status
I have a doubt: Why is this video number 4 trending on Gaming???
I didn't do thanksgiving this year I have nothing to be thankful for this year, the world is in shambles and people are insane online.
Ai topic comments take a bit to happen
Based gumball memes have flooded my tiktok
I NEED the Ai topic comments. Where are they? Oooo ooooo I la la
Bro really had to remind me of the cat
Where tf are ai topic comments
Super cool ai male topic comments. Where are they?
I thought YouTube had new topic comments from machine learning ai.
None of these allegations are seeming super strong, but I am nearly certain Dream is an absolute creep and that something will come out lol
Where are the ai topic comments?
Ai is taking too long to do topic comments. Disappointing.
The ai should be doing the topic comments
Why isnt ai doing topics
Dream looks like Rumplestilkskin from Shrek.
this whole situation just giving me the undeniable urge to rewatch gumball
His cat is so big now! Adorable
Everyone rallying behind Cantu because he was "Wasted" and was having a "Manic Episode" or whatever the fuck are actual brain dead idiots. I dont care if youre drunk if youre having a mental break down or whatever the fuck. What he said still made him a raging prick and people shouldnt be giving him slack. If literally anyone other than Dream exposed that video he would have been seen as the douchebag he is its absolutely wild the lengths people will go to, to defend someone against someone else they hate.
Sometimes I forget he’s a Minecraft YouTuber
I saw this unfold and, as someone who didn’t have the Dream context, I couldn’t believe that people were out there siding with the anti-semitic nonsense-talkin’ kid… I was like “damn, are y’all that desperate to hate Dream? Someone can straight-up assault him and call him a bunch of slurs and everyone’s just like WHY DID YOU HAVE THAT VIDEO, HE’S JUST A TINY 19-YEAR-OLD KID WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH Y-“  And honestly, I’m still like “y’all serious? We’re just gonna overlook the… I mean, sure he was high, but… I don’t know how drunk y’all get, but I would NEVER…”  The amount of people NOT just saying “everyone sucks here, this is a Giant Douche vs Turd Sandwich fight” is still crazy to me. Why do we have to pick sides? Why can’t we just say “damn, you two really deserve each other” and move onto the next cup of tea to spill, eh?
Sure, dream has done questionable things, but NO ONE deserves to have death threats constantly, and being hated like this is like he’s Hitler, or Osama bin Ladin, like DAMN twitter!
This man would not survive a 2009 MW2 lobby
As a 14 year old and a minor who watched dream during the pandemic I can't believe dream is a pedophile but the video of him moaning is really disgusting I will wait for his video to come out but so far it's not looking good for him 😢😢 I don't know why he keeps responding to people on twitter I really hope he is innocent I love his Minecraft videos 😢😢😢
The way prople are defending Cantu like he's a child and excusing his behavior because he was drunk Is just idiotic. He's an adult too, why no accountability?
7:34 uh, clearly doesn’t know who Michaelangelo was or that he was basically an indentured servant of the Medicis.
but, that’s what the point of the mask is
all of this drama just because nobody like his face
6:19 you’re welcome
If I see one more person pretending like ProJared was some innocent victim of a hate mob I'm going to lose my shit. He exchanged nudes with his fans. He didnt just send his dick, he encouraged nudes in return. There is no world where that power imbalance is not exploitative. Stop white washing that creep so you can have a martyr to rally behind. If you want a victim, mention Kwite, not him.
I'm not a dream fan, I don't hate him, but I will say that dream SA allegations skyrocketed from once in a while to "holy shit im not even paying attention to this why do I keep getting this"
i just know that’s gonna get clipped
4:08 are people really taking this shit that seriously? That sounds like a prank 13 years old will play and laugh about to the friends. This got to be just joke
the cat in the beginning is so cute
bro went to faking manhunts to messaging minors to singing horribly then fought the final boss gumball
cant believe he willingly posted a video of himself getting absolutely obliterated 😭
Charlie you did not have to put the moaning video in jesus man worse jumpscare than the Nun II
Low quality moan jumpscare
People hate Deam because they're told to. What he does Is nothing that other content creators don't do. No, "f*g" Isn't reclaimed to every gay person. Being drunk doesn't excuse shit
dream and shane dawson might as well be the same person now
Glad Charlie is defending dream
his cat: master , it is i your lord and savour. pet me this instant
Clippee charlie moaning for the Charlie Drama saga
The worst part is him not making a fucking video and disproving it all. He said he will make a video regarding the grooming allegations, a year ago! And now when he is trouble he starts making it. Also Charlie dream confirmed it was him moaning, but he said he sent it to the ex or something like that
nah. still with gumball
Feel like making a video detailing every bizarre allegation against you is a terrible idea
None of this would be an issue if twitter did not exist
I’ve been waiting for this one
Not totally sure how I feel about the allegations because I could totally see ethier out come. Like Dream has such a crazy hate following that it wouldn't shock me if somebody made it up. On the other hand Dream kinda fits a similar profile to the pro Smash players who were exposed as creeps a few years ago. Kinda a socially akward loner who suddenly and abruptly gained a massive audience of extremely loyal and impressionable fans who shower him with positive attention that he is otherwise not used to receiving. In Dream's case, the fans are underage. Idk if Dream actively seeks underaged girls or if he is just desperate, and so he sees his fans as an easy mark. But i think this explains the creepy thrist trap posts and the other creepy stuff we do know about him. It doesn't confirm any of the more serious allegations, but let's just say it didn't make these allegations all that shocking.
I love Charlie! Keep your shit real and Hope to see your sucsess realized in your progeny brother. Happy Thanksgiving!
I can imagine dream putting a apology/acknowledgement video where he's just doing a stupid brain dead man hunt. Where it's just his Minecraft character just running. He just has no creativity. Just running or chasing. Which is concerning cause we dnt want him chasing kids.
That is a very different dream than is on YouTube...
Everyone hating on dream but not Nicholas being rude to the uber
Well it wouldnt be definite evidence if he hadnt confirned himself the moaning audio is real lmfao (his defense was it was sent to an adult and not a minor)
Just saw Nicholas Cantu absolutely bomb on Kill Tony, can't believe he said he's gonna do stand up as a brag
Dream should have just kept the mask on.
Minecraft YouTuber is a weirdo and creepy with minors. Who coulda guessed lol
Can’t believe I watched this. Who cares about some 20 year old drama. Y’all wild
Poop in urinal
I hope he hires a mathematician to explain what happened
Dream…how the mighty have fallen
Dream? A white minecraft let's player turning out to be a pdfile and groomer? What a surprise.
The only reason this was barable is that there was a kitty in the first 30 seconds
time for another dream song: Riding the train (Feat. Colleen Ballinger)
This is almost hourly now about someone doing something. What is it about 2023 and people needing attention?
Today I’m thankful for Charlie’s luscious locks
No one is thankful for Twitter.
I have been WAITING for bro to cover this
I think that either way dream he is really digging a bigger hole from self. It’s really sad. If he’s innocent, that’s great. but he really needs to take a break from the Internet and especially Twitter.
He decided to not use twitter before   Yet he uses it
you forget about the part when he said he didint care if they were a minor on his stream
I love everyone trying to justify any of it because they don't like Dream. Okay? Me neither. But no one deserves to be assaulted. It doesn't matter how old or how much bigger their assailant is. Assault is assault. And mental disorders do NOT excuse assault. You don't get to claim you murdered all those people because you were manic, and get away with it. You don't get to excuse it because he was drunk, or high, or being "antagonized". You don't attack people.   I mean, imagine you're Dream and you've gotten into an argument with someone you don't know at a party. Then you smell them and notice how drunk and high they are. They're slurring their words and talking big, and then they come at you and attack you. You decide to leave and end up in the same Uber, and then this person gets in with you. So of course you start recording because you don't trust them, and when you share your proof of what happened, people claim that YOU are the bad guy here because this 20 year old grown man is ACTUALLY a teenager, and it's your fault that someone underage is drinking illegally, and also you just deserve it because you're supposedly a pedophile.   I don't like Dream, but stop fucking gaslighting the guy. Being an asshole to him won't make him any less of an asshole. It'll just help him justify acting that way to himself.
I ain't reading allat
Honestly I was waiting for Charlie to cover this situation and couldn’t figure out why he hadn’t talked about it yet but now that I’ve seen his opinion I’m glad he took the time to go through everything and give an opinion that is educated on the matter. I really wish that people didn’t treat criminal accusations so lightly and the people creating accounts to post “proof” and “counterproof” disgust me.
Dream is the father to my baby and he needs to pay child support.
i love that Charlie is basically just the internet news, being a "reporter" he does a pretty good job of not spreading misinformation and overall does everything a proper news article should AND he's funny
Dream is a new breed of lolcow. Bred and trained in the bowels of the internet to be milked not for raging on livestreams or unhinged response videos, but for daily mental breakdowns in the form of paragraphs and paragraphs of tweets.  Were any of the allegations ever true? Given his general weird behavior for someone with a child fanbase, and his encouragement of what literally everyone told him from the beginning was a gross parasocial creator-fanbase relationship that any influencer should avoid like the plague, probably. But it doesn’t matter what’s true anymore.   The internet has figured out and perfected the formula for turning Dream into twitter’s biggest lolcow. Accuse him of anything, and no matter how wild the allegation he will respond, no matter how random and inconsequential the source is, because he’s extremely sensitive and terminally online. The parasocial relationship goes both ways like that, he cares what literally every single person out there says and thinks about him and doesn’t know when to just not engage. He’s gen Z’s first big lolcow, and like most lolcows, he lacks the basic awareness to realize that it’s his own ridiculous reactions, insecurity, and hypersensitivity that attracts this behavior like a magnet. It started snowballing back when he got publicly upset with people making fun of his cult fanbase, then the cheating allegations, then the drama with his streamer friends, then the  more serious allegations, and 3 years later and it’s to the point where it’s taken over his life.
The problem with Dream and most content creators is that theyve never been punched in the face, literally or metaphorically. Never actually worked. Never actually had real world confrontation. I like creators that grinded out a channel while also working an actual job. One tag to his ledt orbital and dream would be humbled.  Like im technically from the same city as the Pauls and were close to the same age. They could never show their face on my block. As much clout as they have theyd get their shit got here.
It's almost like he should have left the mask on and not play minecraft
Thanks for the news
minecraft youtubers and allegations go hand-in-hand
Imagine the many offshots audios of charlie cum sounding weird people already did with this video.
charlie moist critical based? (idk why I'm surprised, just don't see many big youtubers publicly talking about their distaste for dream)
All dream had to do was keep making minecraft videos and he could have been making literally millions
6:20 Moist moan reveal?!!1!!2??1?
Thanks for all the videos happy Thanksgiving Jesus
Please make a video about BBC Top Gear series ended by Freddie Flintoff accident  Happy thanksgiving 2023 🦃
Even with all the accusations piled up against Dream and the amount of haters he has, Im surprised that Charlie wants to remain neutral until further, more concrete evidence is provided. GENERALLY, False evidence shouldnt be taken lightly since it can ruin people's lives and everyone close to them
Finally, I've been so excited to see Charlie's take on it
He tweeted about it calling it “revenge porn” that kind of proves everything tbh ☠️☠️☠️
The fluffyness of that kitty's tail!
Charlie, fix your camera please.
Charlie is the only person that can talk about drama and be trending for gaming
to answer the question about moaning - a lot of ppl, esp women, do rlly like the sounds of guys moaning and there are sites that exist that are essentially audio only porn sites, plus you can find a bunch right here on youtube since theres technically nothing explicit (unless they got them meat slapping sounds thats extra points)
god can i get a trigger warning from hearing dream moaning. actual cringe.
Your head is basically your neck my guy
Josh giddey
Still find it pretty bad that Dream got himself into a place where he let someone under drinking age get manically drunk and then recorded it, only to use it against them when getting flak
Why are you eating sand?
Is Charles gonna end up on podaphiles :x
dream keeps rolling nat 1s on charisma checks
Charlie, EDP sent literal shit pics to someone once. Nothing is off the table as far as pedophiliac degeneracy goes.
Dude show his face and got fuckin blasted with problem 😂
charlie is the only reliable news source. he only makes claims that have actual evidence to prove them, thats more than most news stations
LITERALLY GASPED AFTER SEEING YOUR CAT OH MUH GAWD
Hes still a pedo in my eyes
Gumball is delusional.
When your fanbase is entirely composed of quirky 13 year olds, you can't really expect things to be logical and factual. You can only run away as fast as possible.
What thirst traps has he posted? I checked his insta and twitter he don’t post anything sexy lmao
I feel bad for him
The out of context clips are gonna be so good from this episode.
excuse my l;ast comment, WATCH OUT
if charlie can't imagine someone sending moaning audios, wait until he finds out about soundgasm
Dream and the drunk kid have the most disgusting texts. Completely illegible walls of texts full of slang and no punctuation 🤢 I gave up trying to understand.
Why don't you elaborate! Happy thanks giving btw
All avoidable drama if you just, you know, be normal. Big ask.
Happy Thanksgiving
i like that dream being a potential pedo and getting a minor drunk then trying to black mail them with a video is a "crazy" situation but poki selling over priced cookies and making a joke about calling someone broke is "horrible"
i think it’s a classic problem of not shutting the fuck up. cantu publicly got into beef with a dream parody account (which to be fair he is known for) and dream once again making situations worse for himself by interacting and bringing attention to them. everyone is sick and tired of dream and his fan base so as soon as there is an ability to drag him people will.
well karma hits...bro used kids to rig minecraft mob vote through twitter...now those kids are back firing him on twitter lmao
Fun fact! My friend goes to ucf and dream was an alumni there. He frequently visits the college bar which is notorious for giving underage girls alcohol. He even brings sapnap and george with him on occasion. He buys these girls drinks every single time he goes! These are 18-20 year old girls! I have photo proof as well! This guy is genuinely a creeper and i do not trust a word he says.
Bro kept the info until he could use it against him
the way you use nouns and adjectives to describe things cracks me up XD
Glad to know I didn't waste my time trying to find out what happened because I still wouldn't figure it out even if I tried. Thank you Charlie
I wasn't ready for that primal moan of Charlie. lol
6:23 someone clip this
Nicholas was going band for band 😭
Its so nice to have LA bitch boy drama to distract ourselves with while the rest of the world goes to shit
Imagine being against a 20 year old who's blackout drunk and saying slurs and nonsense and still finding a way to lose. Classic Dream.
Charlie. I love you to death  The next time you play a video of a grown man moaning in my ears I'm stealing all of your right ankle socks
6:17 I just failed NNN
His inability to shut up and making things worse makes me wonder why did he choose to becomes a youtuber in the first place, he knows that this is the risk that he has to take
6:19 This is why I'm subscribed to Charlie. 🤣
The whole situation is stupid
heya, not native english speaker here and not an american either! As such I am not quite familiar with the concept of "slurs", so I am a bit confused by the people claiming that "the F word" is a slur that should never be said, more so when 10 years ago it seemed everybody was using that word pretty freely and while it was still an insult it wasn't considered the bomb that it is today.  How do this type of words go from "it's bad to say it and very impolite" to "you are a monster if you ever utter those letters in that order"? This is a legitimate question, in my native language we don't have ANY word that we consider that can't ever be said under any circumstance... we don't have an equivalent to a word that is so bad we have to mention it by the first letter only.  I became interested on that notion after reading this comment section. Can someone explain this to me? this seems like a cultural difference i find interesting.
I like your cat.
I was waiting patiently for him to cover this situation
dream catching a fade from gumball was not on my bingo card
Bro you're missing the part when dream himself called the nasty ass moaning "revenge porn". Which he wouldn't IF IT WEREN'T FUCKING REAL. OMG YOU DON'T HAVE A BRAIN.
Thought this cryaotic looking minecrafttuber got cancelled for cheating at.. Minecraft
Bizarre.
I dont understand the dream hate, I completely understand warranted dream hate (based off real evidence) but even before he was involved in any drama people just didnt like him and i guess thats just what comes from success. Another reason to not be famous.
I've hated dream ever since the face reveal or from before that. Not because he's ugly/ handsome, heck i dont even care.   But it's coz of the way he did it. He is a narcissist true but he is also very manipulative and children fall for that. Its insane how even older Youtubers try to defend him.   How is he manipulative? He milks views from the death of his friend that died last year and plays the victim infront of the friend's father. His audience believes that he is still mourning and is a "good" friend. Just watch his live performance. Where his singing made me puke but he literally cried at the end playing victim again, when his audience started to leave.
Gumball Wallopen Waterson
If you ever feel sad remember there are people online who actively harras some random ass adult all because he maybe faked his speedrun and has a LGBT fanbase that ships him with his friend   Some random ass egotistical voice actor who only has one role under his belt called him slurs and assaulted him and they’re going after dream 😂
Nick is fucking hilarious, if someone spoke to me like that while crossfaded i think id shit myself laughing.
He Just had to reveal his face...
Man, it’s nice to know that whatever happens we always have a good person that WONT get involved in worthless drama or act like a bratty child, but a person who will dive into the deep end of whatever’s going on and give us all the news. Thank you
nightmare
What’s ironic about this situation he’s literally a cryoatic 2.0
its honestly impressive really  like think about how much this has spiraled out of control. its actually incredible
The "DREAM DID WHAT" audios are real, he confirmed they were real on his priv twitter, but appearently they are "revenge porn" and it somehow tracks back to his ex which is also allegedly a lie.
I really wish I never heard dream-esque moaning
6:19 Charlie moaning
I think the most frustrating part of all this is that people hate dream so much that they're willing to forgive all the insane awful things this voice actor said and did and write it off as an episode because they simply cannot fathom doing anything other than being against dream. Like dream aside, so much of that stuff is not excusable whatsoever, episode or no.
Shane Dawson mourn lol xD
Sometimes, silence is the solution in any drama this petty. Dream is literally destroying himself for having the inability to shut up.
Dream will hire a math professor to prove that he didn’t do it.
I can’t believe Dream is losing to a Ninja Turtle.
I see drama; I like.
4:10 He eventually did admit to those being his videos
Can I see the guns again pls
Dream is still relevant?
At the 3 second mark, Io looks photoshopped in
Im inclined to believe the alligations purely due to the track record of these minecraft youtubers
it's crazy how nobody is mentioning that this conflcit between nicolas and dream only started in the first place because a parody account of dream made an ironic post that nicolas happened to see
Dream vs the man who killed technoblade?
I honestly wanted someone big and popular to address the 'gr00ming' allegations of dream coz its always drag out of nowhere, especially rn, the gumball bs dream altercation every comments are abt dream gr00ming shit but actually the claims are not proved. I am no a dream stan, yes I was in the fandom but only those kind of fan where u only watch their produced content. gr00ming isn't a 'just' 'funny' 'easy' thing, it is real and disturbing.
5:11 Next time on dragon ball Z
While I was going to give dream the benefit of the doubt before, the moaning is just the nail in the coffin. He has quite literally admitted to sending it. And while he claims it "wasn't to a minor", at this point he's just deflecting.
The amount of allegations in these comments sections on how it keeps getting backed up by "evidence" or debunking said evidence is sickening. Shows how much the internet love drama.
How can Dream be so bold when hes got a face like a crescent moon
i think im gonna throw up at those moaning snapchats, thats so disturbing and disgusting
Asking legitimately, does it matter that I don't care either way what happens with Dream? I know of him, I don't watch him. Like I get bad people doing bad things is bad and not good. But if I just don't really care and just want to see how it ends, am I a garbage person?
dinner was fire
*4chan is having a field day with this drama*
Ever since dream revealed his face it’s all been downhill.
DOG AND CAT APPEARANCE
Charlies moans are beautiful
He’s definitely a pedo. Just look at him and how he interacts with fans
Io is a beautiful cat, please keep her far, far away from Shane Dawson.
Why are everyone against dream on this? That kid is a genuine menace
THERE! now all the Twitter mfs can stop complaining about Charlie making more videos on the Pokimane cookies instead of this.
Happy thanksgiving Charlie🎉
IO AND CAYDA IS SO CUTEE!!
I hope we never see a ‘penguinz0 situation is crazy’ video 😵‍💫
O man im very much disgusted and im mid way through the video
Josh giddey next! Happy thanksgiving 🤪🤪
Every time I read a dream tweet I get like 5 words in, and then it just turns into “me mee mee me me. Me me me, memeemee mee me”
Imagine being in your mid 20’s and getting bitched by a 19 year old.
Being from the east coast, when I moved to SoCal at 25, hearing the term cross faded was hilarious
JOSH GIDDEY 15 ON AND OFF COURT
The amount of controversies Dream has been a part of is truly baffling. There’s gotta be a point where he grows up and stops arguing against every person that speaks ill of him
I am starting my thanksgiving like my forefather did : committing a geno*idea of natives
Innocent or not, I still can't trust that guy making a whole ass paragraphs about how he sees fans are kittens and the whole quackity drama over a server idea
freaks like everyone with pronouns in their bio
you're a fucking disney princess lmaoooo
Don't celebrate Thanksgiving but thanks Charlie
To be honest I do sort of believe the video is his because in one of his tweets he classes it as "revenge p*rn," why would he take the state of revenge p and not fake p if it wasn't actually him? Just seems iffy but he might just be stupid or thought revenge p was something else idk
This is not related at all but my uncle says he saw god and spoke with him
Dream is trying to achieve the world record for the most hated person on twitter and im looking forward to him achieving that goal!
Charlie talking about a 5 second video on twitter for 10 minutes and making a million dollars
Honestly he is so up in life with millions no clue why he is worried abt Twitter rumors he needs to realize ppl make rumors when famous
I feel like Charlie is ignoring the evidence that his Snapchat account and it's him moaning
He should’ve never showed his troll face
i’ve literally never knew you had a cat, as a guy with 4 cats your officially valid within the cat cult i’d you would like to join
I can’t get over how cute Charlie’s cat is
bro charlie i love ur voice im falling asleep to it not in a weird way
Kitty is gorgeous.
what family?
Innocent till prove guilty. With many cases of defamation all over the internet, I think this is one of them.
Charlie can I have your cat
I had a dream ride my pony on my reservation
Not gonna lie, I think Dream is a weirdo, but he's literally the only one who provided actual solid evidence. I'm already geared to believe the claims against Dream, and yet the evidence against him is so absurdly weak that i can't honestly believe it.
I’ve got to say that out of everything I’ve seen this is one of the most fair treatments of the situation. I’ve been a long time fan of yours and this is exactly why. I have been a fan of Dream’s since when he had less than 3 million subscribers and while I agree that he’s done a lot of things and made a lot of mistakes I’m holding judgment for now. There’s so much confusing information out there and I really have no idea what’s going on anymore. I have no intention to support anyone that has done anything like the things he’s been accused of but at the same time I also don’t want to condemn somebody who’s been falsely accused. That’s why I am waiting on the sidelines to see what happens and I appreciate unbiased and thorough job you did with this video.
Man, I wish I would get super mega famous all over the world...just so I could piss off as many people as possible when I come out and tell everybody that I am who I am and I don't give a damn.
Dream getting sparked by gumball is the highlight of my Month
I’ve seen so many videos on YouTubers being pedos and I know most have been proven as being pedos. But every time I think some people really would make allegations like that just to drum up controversy
Play stupid games and win stupid prizes. Thes influencers and youtubers are delusional human beings.
Dream twitter drama is as contradictory as FNAF lore 1:02
Under certain Gumball vs Dream memes, I keep reading in the comments that allegedly Dream gave Nicolas alcohol, not sure what source is but its something I keep seeing
All I know is people drawing gumball animations using the video…
Apparently Dream wasn't the person who filmed that encounter(?) and he came into the footage later. I can imagine not wanting to drop the footage as a form of professional courtesy, and only doing so after being disparaged by Kantu since the gloves were clearly off at that point.
wtf is a thirst trap?
Charlie dream confirmed the moaning himself. Please dont defend this piece of scum. I have alot of respect for you but id expect you to do some more research on this before trying to justify thst it might be fake.
been waiting for your vid on this lol
tHat's what the *mAAAASK IS*
Dream can possibly cure cancer but his fake will make his the one causing the cancer
dream recorded an underage 19 year old that was drunk and high while he was manic, then films it to use it against him later on
Can confirm dudes who can't talk to women think it's sexy to send audio of them moaning. i dated some of them. if you've ever listened to those "boyfriend ASMR" videos that made you cringe out of your skin that happens to be how they talk irl.
The disbelief and disgust that Charlie had that someone would even THINK to send someone moaning videos had me dying 😂😂😂
Nic is both pan and autistic so like he can reclaim. Dream however is a gigantic pussy and recorded it
well what you said dream would say
I lost all respect for you Charlie the minute you said "sand is real"
Dream? Maybe, but I wouldn’t call the situation crazy.
Anyone with google and who can type can see this is not Dreams account, because yes, anyone could be a little creep, pretend to dream, and send his perverted crap to people.  But one thing for sure is, if Dream has snapchat, it is probably the dream account with the most followers, which is not dream dream.
i love how well spoken you are, you really know what youre talking about and its nice to listen to you comment on situations! i trust your opinion
Look I’m a dream fan. Have been for years and shit. Can’t rly defend what’s going on rn. But I love that Charlie takes all the stuff that’s come out and is commenting on it in a neutral ground and setting. It’s refreshing to see someone take all evidence we have and try to explain
This whole situation is proof that Dream really just needs to get off the internet and go live quietly with the money he’s made from it.
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS VIDEO
most likely more bullshit people made up just to say they had dirt on someone who is mildly famous. quite a common occurrence now. i couldn't give less of a crap about dream. but its innocent until proven guilty by the court of law.
He’s such a immature kid and like in his early twenties like bffr he doesn’t know any better and I hope he gets what he deserves
This is from all of us. Never moan like that again.
Pokimane cookies took longer than dream allogations
Who tf is dream? What's his content?
This guy is funny 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Seems like if you’re an adult male playing Minecraft or Roblox then there’s a very high chance you message kids in your free time.
there has been so much alleged dream grooms minors shit so im just gonna believe he does since the amount of times he has been accused
I don't like Dream. I hope the allegations against him are real. If it's not true it would just be a waste of time, and a minor headache for him, since kids that fight on friday are playing again together on monday
Through dreams own statistical odds, one of these allegations has to be true with how many there are
Dream is a creeper. You can see it in his face. It's in the eyes.
Love watching your videos! Happy Thanksgiving Charlie!! 🍁
are we suprised, all these claims come with a job description for minecraft youtubers
Happy Thanksgiving
Is that a Gundam Exia?
Face reveal was the worst thing he couod have done in this sue happy climate
He shouldve stayed as a masked minecraft youtuber 💀💀💀   Then we might not have found out about this weirdos life 💀💀💀
charlies actually going crazy over this look at his mouth dribbling at 7:58
r/gonewildaudio
Bro gumball kicking dream but
Okay but Charlie's cat is a top tier floof. 15/10 cat.
i hate dream but thank you for saying all this 😭 people saying that this shit is concrete proof and acting like he’s a confirmed pedophile because of some insanely easily faked evidence is so chronically online. like the second some real concrete evidence comes out then i’m happy to hop on the “dream is a pedo” board
Great video.
All im saying is its ok for others to post a not in the right state of mind dude saying some terrible stuff and later use it to prove someone is a asshole and the dude recording is fine but when its dream it suddenly not ok ?   Famn im starting to think dream stans never existed and all there ever was was dream haters who meat ride anything thats negative against him and purposely feed into him as trolls to make him slip full well knowing hes young and doesn't know better.  Guess the internet really does like to tear into people they hate
all publicity is good publicity
The gumball actor 🤢 what a pos  Drunk and cross faded is no excuse 🤦‍♂️ neither is a manic episode lol  Manic episodes don't turn you into a racist 😐
I love that you’re a Cat Dad now Charlie. You are too powerful.
now ur making minecraft drama videos, this a new low
Charlie im not doing anything for festivities, food, or anything else to celebrate today because we’ve already done Thanksgiving Day in Not-America land lol
Wait, what was wrong with Dream filming the Gumball actor being a shithead and showing it? There's nothing wrong with someone exposing your bad behavior? Charlie, literally almost every video you've ever made was someone else bad being shown.
3:54 lmao that 100% does not sound like Dream at all
I hate that tiktok drama content is so full of fake bullshit and naive kids with no critical thinking skills who believe everything they see, it makes it hard to find what's real or not, these braindead kids just love making shit up for fun with no regard to how it hurts real victims and innocent people and the even more braindead kids share it like it's innocent playground gossip
Bro please make video on mawb he’s so annoying he just harasses people in public
Even if Dream didnt do a ton of creepy shit, its so odd that he was drinking with someone underaged and recorded them while they were having a manic episode. Thats such a weird fucking thing to do. Ive also heard that he held onto that video for god knows how long to use it against Nicholas. Most of thats alleged but I wouldnt be surprised.
Charlie, I hate to tell you this, but there are a huge group of women who go absolutely crazy for men moaning. Not Dream, but you know, attractive men 😅
the drama queen is back!@!!!@!
I love how big your fluffy cat is. Like 4 rl do I fx with that. OMG! you should like to make a UM like a video describing the emotional evanescence and mental psychology of the domesticated feline. Specifically, the one furry baby that you have introduced to us personally through a YouTube video in cyberspace. I love cats and want to study their personality  individually in person so I can write a book about how to socialize on their level so we could build stronger civilization together. A society that is not human dominated, but rather greatly influenced by feline culture. I mean, male and female humans are brilliant, but I think we would be better off as a society if we have feline influence in our daily lives.
Are we just gonna ignore this 6:19
I just dislocated my knee, how's your thanksgiving?
Happy Thanksgiving…
this video is such a disservice to the victims…the false accuser, Layla, literally said she just likes drama. dream ADMITTED the audios from the most recent victim ARE real and is him…the person he accused run the account, Natt, has already been proven to not be related to the burner at all….
New video
the dog just disappears ?
Bro said thirst traps💀 please moist your blind asf
quandale dingle went to the future to take charlies moaning sound
he 100% had somthing in his butt while recording the moaning thing
I have not seen a dream video in my life but i got the popcorn for this one 😅
Lmao!  When you got to the disbelief that some guy would just send moaning, I can tell you they absolutely do!  I’m actually old enough to remember the old telephone dating things. My friend and I one day decided to call.  We were about 18.  All it was was literally dudes moaning.  We laughed so hard.  Nothing but a moaning sausage party.
I have never watched dream, vaguely knew the allegations, nothing changes he’s just always a weirdo
6:19 master oogway moaning
"i have no way of knowing this is dream" DREAM ADMITTED IT WAS HIM???????
ah, i see dream is finally succumbing to the minecrafter curse, he's held it off for a while ill give him that but it seems that one child was just too attractive to ignore
5:11 the sequel to wooooooo yeah baby
You look like jebus
Whenever someone comes out with their politics not being aligned with woke left-wing goofy clown-ism, the first thing that happens is allegations of a sexual nature.  Lets see the evidence, lets see it in court, and if he is determined to be innocent, lets see some court of public opinion backlash on the opposing side (at the very least).
Idk feels like grasping at straws going off of a thirst trap
Cool cat
This is such a goddamn farce. People are spinning the narrative that Dream deliberately filmed this to use for blackmail later on which is some strange fucking conjecture. I have a million videos of people I know doing some weird and strange things. I have so many videos I never even watched back, they just sit on my phone because I haven't gone through and deleted them because that would be a waste of my time.  The fact that people are siding with Gumball over this is also strange. There's a smoking gun of him saying slurs and being nasty and rude, yet people are still siding with him. And for what? It's such an absolutely classic display of high school drama. It's a walking talking trope come to life. So absurd.
The most unsurprising thing imaginable, another Minecraft YouTuber is a pedo. But guess we'll just have to wait and see If dreams another on the long list.
No idea who he is. Never heard of him.
I agree however, dreams digging a hole. The audios had no proof it was him yet in his most recent tweet he CONFIRMED that was his audio. He said it wasnt against a minor and it was "revenge p" but hes digging a hole and honestly im not surprised, he needs to shut the hell up. Cause yeah he probably does touch kids and he cant shut up and just keeps digging a hole.
i just think everyones doggin at dream at this point the people want the mans career over and im all for it 💀
AHHH WHY DID YOU PLAY IT
Honestly, why would anybody be thankful for twitter
The cat hitting its tail on the microphone was insane bass
Honestly what kwite said was best, shut the fuck up until you made that video
Charlie doesn’t know how big moaning and whimper audios are?💀
Very rare when a famous youtuber isn't a narcissist 😕
I'm calling it, Charlie moaning is going to be a meme or at the very least something that's taken out of context
melaina is hot : )
I’m gonna say something incredibly controversial:  I don’t care if he did or didn’t do it at this point,I just wanna stop fucking hearing about it,genuinely.  For half of the entire year it’s been dreams a groomer here and Dreams a groomer there,I just want you all to fucking stop talking about it,WE KNOW,I just wanna wait for the video to drop before the internet accuses him,if we learned anything from the Kwite Fiasco a few months back,it is that both sides must be told accurately before judgement can be passed,I swear hearing the same shit a million different ways at 10 different times in the day makes me wanna put a bullet through my eye
Holy SHIT Eye-O got big
Dream confirmed it was real
Put simply, why would a YouTuber or person in a place of power or privilege EVER need a Snapchat.   Snapchat is for TEENAGERS and KIDS. No adult over the age of 21 who isn't extremely immature should have a Snapchat account or the app still downloaded on their phone.
And I remember when he was Twitter's god
Our cat looks just like your cat, but ours is short hair. Almost identical markings.
Imagine having such bad reputation that even after getting beaten up the people are siding with the one who beat you up
When I clicked this video I wasn't expecting to ejaculate! Charlie really should give us a NSFW warning if he plans on moaning on screen!
thank you for covering this dawg🙏
6:19 Strangely turned me on 😂
imagine getting rinsed by Gumball lmao, Dream is a groomer POS
I was waiting for this video after learning about it two days ago.
I agree with gumball the point of the the mask song makes dream sound gay
charlie I thought you said you were done with twitter, why do you keep doing this to yourself
hum you are for the first time making me cringe, doing jokes while diminishing the situation when he actually ADMITTED the snapchat video, like do you react too much to crazy stuff that you losing common sense or are u actually defending a guy who uses his underaged audience ? Like what in the actual f* are you doing, saying, charlie ? + the "can't believe the stuff he sent" oh well now you taking us for damn fools ? Nah you can't just hang around people of your sphere et be like "oh people really do this kind of stuff" ? just fckin suspicious you are not a toddler you are supposed to know this shit
lmao 6:20 was the best voice acting ive ever seen from charlie
Tbf Dream's actual analytics show the biggest chunk of his fans are in the 18-24 age range. I'm looking through some of his prior posts, and I'm not seeing any "thirst traps" that seem that inappropriate to post publicly tbh. Maybe I'm missing some?
Watching this with my bf-commeting on his account; Charlie, did you forget to straighten the other side of your hair or does it just fall like that? 😅
Holy shit that moaning impression made me cry
If I had a nickel for every bad thing that happens every week or month, I’d be MrBeast the 2nd
The only relevancy that dream gets is when be gets into drama and im pretty sure he secretly enjoys it
"I need to beat the speedrun cheating allegations," Dream said as another finger on the monkey's paw curled
First that incest game, now this. This year's thanksgiving is finna be crazy.
I’m surprised it too this long for dream to be accused of being a pedo. Especially with him being one of the biggest Minecraft YouTubers.
This comment section is full of literal toddlers. I feel like people just lost their will to independently think over the last few years and only believe what they see on the internet because the amount of people in the comments acting as if they somehow have the inside source we all don't and know for a FACT Dream did what they're saying he did is crazy. The fact people would just ruin someone's life over allegations that aren't proven just because they don't like the guy and think he's weird is genuinely scary. And what's worse is the people are defending the nick dude like hes just some saint who made a minor oopsie I never watched dream but I always loved AWOG that alone doesn't blind me to the fact the nick is human and makes mistakes like us all so he needs to face the consequence's too. What does it matter if the video wasn't released right away doesn't excuse nick for being a dick. Charlie literally says there's no concrete proof he came across and it might even be the other way around and that all these allegations might be being falsified yet its mind blowing to me how one sided the comments are for the most part against a guy who hasn't been proven of anything. Just goes to show cancel culture is real and doesn't need a reason beyond not liking someone. Then you have all these wanna be detectives in here talking as if they know for a fact dream did this and that saying it with so much confidence that people with the IQ of a hamster believe it.
god im so tired of dream
dream COME true
I love Io so much. She’s such a cutie
Dream cheated in minecraft
Charlie could've made a post saying, "we don't know if any of this is real or not, we will see". Instead of talking in circles and wasting a 10 min video. Making content on what ifs with clickbait titles is weird.
I actually hate the dream situation. We can all agree he can be weird sure, but it’s so fucked to wrongfully accuse him of grooming and S/A for fucking memes. Being falsely accused is one of the worst feelings in the world, the man doesn’t deserve any of this just because people find him ‘cringe’
Let’s be honest every single minecraft YouTuber gives of strong chomo vibes
it’s unfortunately common
He should defiantly take a look into Daniel Larson cause that is crazy
whats crazier is that the allegations that he faked another speedrun would at minimum be 5x the size of  this
Charlie will own a news channel one day
Ya that’s great and all but did you know that dream bombed a school
I hang out on fanfiction sites pretty often, and the amount of adult Dream fics I've seen are out of this world. On just one site alone there are 4k tagged with Dream SMP and 7k tagged with Dream. Like, nah bro, I don't want any part of it. Dream fans are way too weirdly obsessed and parasocial. I don't even want to understand this drama, I wish I could filter everything related to him out of my internet traffic. I just get weird vibes from that general side of the internet.
Speaking of allegations did you hear about NBA player Josh Giddey?
bring slap tournaments back
some good news on the other hand for you Charlie, infamous tiktok "prankster" mizzy has recently been arrested and has a court order that says hes not allowed to use social media.  The mischievous rapscallion's shenanigans have come to an end
I would like to confirm that guys definitely do send audio clips of them moaning to females. And yes, it is gross and weird and we don't like it
That did not sound like Dream at all 🤨🤔
Happy thanksgiving big Charles
Always knew how much of an actual fucking creep Dream and his Dorito-Like face is
once i got into the moaning clips, i had to tap out. Y'all are stronger than me.
I would not be surprised in the slightest if it was all true Dream is freaky as hell
2:03 can't forgot that I saw someone claiming Dream to be the leader and commander of an "international terrorist organisation" which is kinda true consider the Dream stans and all
Don't lie, people dunk on Dream because watching him have a breakdown over it is hilarious and entertaining.
6:18 i'm clipping this and sending it as a voice mail
Junky janker on top
i feel like this upcoming dream video is going to be a total dumpster fire and im ready to see this unfold, LOL
'x situation is crazy'
What i dont understand is why Dream was with gumball while he was drunk and high, as gumball had been 19 in this video, making him underage, because with that being the case, the conclusion I cant but help to understand is that dream supplied nicolas with alcohol and drugs.
Freaking content creators need to stop engaging with fans. Especially when they are predominantly minors.
i hate to say it but, he is a minecraft youtuber afterall
I think dream “dreams” about twitter drama
I think he just hates himself and gets hard when all of twitter hates him so he creates accounts to make shit up about himself, that's my headcanon
This proves how dangerous being cringey on the internet is. So much of the internet is so eager to make shit up to spite the guy
Well, ever since Dream unmasked himself, it's becoming his downfall.
Charlie it my birthday
It’s true what they say you know yourself the best
Dream is the type of guy to be show up in court and prosecuted himself.
All these allegations just makes me miss technoblade way more tbh….
So many great soundbytes of Charlie in this video...
I will say as someone who dates boys, them being so horny they send a black video of them moaning while they jerk off is some teenager shit, but something boys do nonetheless
This is literally like the FNAF ending where William's army of children turned against him. Like Dream's army of stans turned against him.. most of.
as a female who spent the better part of a year on tinder, adding snapchats, it is common for men to send cringe like that.
6:19 don't be shy charlie. give us a real example 😈
What a creep. I’m so confused by this dream guy’s lack of maturity.
The fact that Dream was called the F-slur and STILL managed to be the one cancelled is pure comedy to me 😂.  Edit: I don't care about anyone saying slurs, it takes a lot for me to get offended. The fact that he said it, didn't get flamed, and instead Dream was the one revieving backlash from the situation is comedic. For all we know, Gumball va could've just said that to avoid backlash btw.
Charlie is my favorite person bro
CHARLIE WHY WOULD YOU PUT THE MOANING IN THE VIDEO. TS IS TRAUMATIZING I DIDNT WANNA HEAR IT.
Having too much money fucks ur head
Someone correct me if I’m wrong.. didn’t dream get ‘famous’ from on YouTube by playing Minecraft??? All I need to know is
charlie what situation isnt crazy to you?
5:36 oh... well thankyou Charlie uwu
I really don't think this video does the whole drama justice, kind of disappointed.
Wait, so the voice of Gumball was using slurs, and people sided with him? I get not wanting to side with Dream, with what he has done in the past, but that doesn’t mean you have to side with Nicholas either. That’s how we keep getting bad presidents. People are really flocking to one evil or the other, rather than choosing neither. Unless is the people who are blind fans or oblivious, and think their idol can do no wrong. And for those who try to argue Nicholas was drunk when he said those things, alcohol tends to bring out the true colors of a person, because it removes shame and self-awareness. It basically mutes the conscience.
hey Charlie, any chance you are gonna do a video on the Hikaru Nakamura cheating allegations, old pog champs cross over.
Idk if its just charlie or just everyone is eating this drama up but its crazy this video is already at 1M views
Charlie rocking those Vash the Stampede eyebrows

Putting the whole dream scenario aside, there is some amazing charlie out of context material here
I miss my ex
It’s crazy how him showing his face turned into all this
For actually the first time ever I’ve never heard about a person Charlie is covering and this was cool coming in raw no condom doggy style. Another moist banger
The thing for me with the audio is just the way that dream explained it, saying it was “revenge porn.” That to me, kind of makes me believe to an extent that it could’ve been real. I feel like, if it wasn’t, why would you say it was revenge porn and that you would press charges or whatever
5:40
“I have ADHD too”   Oh brother
What else did he do this time?
Dream the Groom-bot
He courted the cancel culture crowd and crazy parasocial stans into his audience without setting boundaries. I really don't think anyone deserves false accusations, but when you don't wrangle your followers properly, this is what happens.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Happy Thanksgiving Charlie! 🦃
dont know who dream is but they should probably just deactivate their account...
Charlie, reply. If you don't, it means... You didn't reply. I'm kidding love your videos ☠️
I m kinda scared of annual day cuz it's tomorrow I mean In doing good on tabla but now we have to brush it's all to make it shiny like wtf
1.5 views in 5 hours is crazy, Charlie let Me borrow 10,000$
I think that there is a very good chance that Dream gets driven off the internet or at least loses a lot of his following regardless of wether the allegations are true or not. He's dug himself in to an absurdly deep hole, constantly fighting with people on twitter and just flat out lying at times. I think most people just want him gone because he's just such an ass.
kitr
Moist petting his animals like he about to make an apology video
he *is* a minecraft youtuber, so I am not too surprised.
What a sweet boy (the cat)!
Man I’m tired of the world we live in..
It wouldn’t be Minecraft without a pedo using a game and platform to abuse power lol.   *it’s a joke, not accusing him since it is all allegations.*
6:19 out of context is wild
The pets in the begininng ❤️
couldn't have imagined a better way to end my thanksgiving, thank you charlie
I love how Charlie can go from calm to YELLING AT YOU LIKE A CAVE MAN and then back to his usual calm self without missing a beat.
Wait a guy passing a kidney stone while cumming???
Getting to see Io in videos again is such a breath of fresh air
Pokimane Cookie Drama, Kpop Made In Abyss Drama and now Dream Drama, whats next? 😂
I was gonna say ‘Watch out, his stans are gonna dox you’ but Charlie’s got a full arsenal in his house. He’s prepared.
I don’t think he like twitter 0:46
!!!! please cover the matt rife special !!!! it is egregious and no one listens to anyone but you anymore
Seeing Charlie moan made me fail my NNN
"insert dream face reveal" lol
Not again
my family talked about this at thanksgiving dinner
6:18 okay meme soldiers, let's get to work.
Wasn’t actually prepared to hear a grown man moan in my ears but guess we’re here now
i love that charlie is actually doing his best to stick w the facts and isnt throwing out claims that may or may not be true. I hope for the sake of any minors and victims that it's not true but if it is true i hope that it gets figured out and that anyone who was involved in this gets the justice they deserve.
6:00 you don’t know how unbelievably horny people are
Happy Turkey Day!  🦃
I laughed hard when charlie casually presented a clip of dream moaning
I wanna know why they took an uber together
A minecraft YouTuber with 1k subs is better than dream. Bro literally does nothing
i just got secondhand embarrassment, thanks dream <3
At a certain point this is literally all our fault. Last time this happened it came out that he was picking up high schoolers while himself 19, qnd everyone said "two year difference isnt that weird."  Yall, the point was one person was a high achooler with no autonomy and the other was a proper adult with disposable income, a car, a house, ect. And we taught them its not weird to be that type of predator.  Dream even fully admitted it was real too. So im not sure if this one is, but so far we have one confirmed case of him picking up high schoolers for sex. And hes admitted the moaning videos were real.  Hes just a pervert society has embolded. Hes here to stay, guys. You all invited the pedophile in last time on some semantic argument so.
unfortunately sending moaning audios is not uncommon
bro's gonna hire another astrophysicist to prove himself
The world would be such a better place if Minecraft didn't exist...
Man Dream cannot keep his nose out of drama. Whether it’s his fault or not doesn’t matter to me because I don’t care about him at all.
:skull: i aint even surprised anymore
6:19 FOR FREE!?!?!
dream = fatherless l bozo  penguinz0 = goated ass sigma male
I'm so relieved that I have no idea who dream is.. never heard of him or his channel.. until this video.. and after like 5 minutes.. I can just close this video and go do something more useful like scratching my left ear.
His worst dream come true
I hate hearing the term cross-faded.  That was just called getting drunk for me growing up
Nicolas cage is a cosmic entity compared to dream.
Wait what did Shane Gillis do to his cat?
this dream situation is as incoherent as the fnaf lore.
you know the whole thing is complicated if even Charlie can't figure it out.  I won't be surprised if Dream actually groomed minor, i mean..come on...he's a Minecraft YOuTuber
lmao Even the comments on this video are wild and go back and forth like the twiiter threads. What a mess.
Charlie moaning is now my new sub alert.
Who
Dont ever moan again Charles or show the clip. Ever. Unlessyouwamdje38r
Love seeing dumb people excusing the drunk moron using slurs because he was faded and/or manic…that’s not how that works, you don’t just magically start holding new views while under the influence, you just aren’t as inhibited so you spew it out instead of running it through the filter first.
you should talk about Squid Game: The Challenge. i think its so fucked netflix made it, like exploiting poor people bad was the whole point of squidgame. They offered a real cash prize and people are threatening to take legal action because they allegedly got nerve damage bc of the challenges. The trailer for the series on netflix is literally one of the contestants pushing themselves past their physical limit because the money would change their life so much and then having to quit because she was in so much pain ,, its honestly kindof sickening
Is this dream guy the one everybody lagged at for the face reveal?
Shane Dawson is upset that you compared him to dream…
You don’t understand my history with minors that’s been proven is wrong
Dream is a Joke. What a lol cow 😂💀
Happy thanks giving Charlie 😀
Honestly dream is gonna be bedtime story to scare kids.   “Hunny if you don’t eat your broccoli dream is show up under your bed.”
The best thing to come out of this whole situation is having every semi-famous twitter user post a tweet with the word minor used in a context not related to people and then quote tweet it with a "Dream is now following you" image
Sadly working for my thanksgiving. Watching your videos make it all less terrible because you never fail to make a mf laugh. Love ya man
This video still didnt clarify anything for me...... this whole thing seems like such a nothing burger? Some young kid that plays minecraft was moaning?... maybe?...and then some other young kid got drunk in an uber and said a bad word or something? what are we rlly doing here? these are just young kids who play minecraft i think people's expectations are way to high for these ppl and who rlly cares anyway
Best Penguinz0 intro to date.
This is why I love watching Charlie the most. He doesn’t just feed into what everyone else is saying. I used to and still am sorta a fan of Dream, but stopped caring once I saw how people treated his face reveal. It was a weird angle, but I don’t really like to see actual bullying and harassment over stuff like that. Some may be funny, but most people were taking it too far.   Now the main part of this is that so many allegations show up of Dream and I usually don’t care because people LOVE to fake stuff about Dream just because they don’t like him. Plus, every allegation I’ve seen, they’ve never brought up ACTUAL PROOF. They just make the tweet and you never see them again. And or they delete their account.  So really it’s just a hate train to me, and that’s why I stopped caring about what people had to say about Dream.
Happy Thanksgiving!!!!
0:01
Regardless of whether he’s guilty or actually innocent, he is literally making himself look so bad right now with this constant activity on social media and defensive attitude. He’s pulling a Colleen Balliner. He should just shut tf up until he clears himself (if he can)
Here I was thinking this was an early drop of the moist meter for that new Nic Cage movie (which I have now confirmed is called Dream Scenario). Whoops; Happy holidays everyone!
I’m celebrating mine with some cupped velveta mac and cheese with a ham sandwich. Be thankful yall
I'm sorry, that one clip going around of Gumball mocking dream and then saying the f slur is so funny. I'm queer and so are most of my friends - we all side with Gumball (on that particular clip).
free charlie whimpers 😌
Yeah we are going to get another “APOLOGY” video before the end of this yeae
remember to always think of the fact that if the allegations were true then why not sue
Looks like kids wanna be famous💀
I audibly screamed hearing that moaning "proof"
Charlie need to be on the Supreme Court
Wow, Dream really can’t keep his mouth shut and actually be a good person, who would’ve seen this coming? I swear I feel a fair amount of influencers feel they are invincible and I’m glad to see the internet retaliating and showing that just because their influencers doesn’t mean they can be absolute shitbags and not face repercussions. Honestly still wish SSSniperwolf  got her channel deleted and got banned on all socials, she is a piece of trash that has almost no talent besides being fake. Let’s hope other influencers learn from this and will be better people.
Charlie moaning requires emoji like reactions😂
Kitty 🐈
I'm choosing to side with gumball on this one. Lesser of two evils, or something like that  Besides, a someone saying a few racist slurs while drunk and/or high is better than a groomer imo
Dream does not know how to be famous
Can you prove that his fans are children Charlie? Or are you just parroting something you heard but didn't actually think about?
After the face reveal for dream he's been falling off 😭
io :3
Shawn Michaels kicking everyone to prove DX is controversial sounds funny to me but this one bit is straddling the line.
I Can’t Breathe when your not there 🗣️🗣️
6:00 oh charlie, you hold too much faith in humanity
Im usually very "Show me concrete evidence or stop talking about it" kind of person but when it comes to "Dream" lets be honest, if it Walks like a Duck and Quacks like a Duck its probably a Duck, Dream has just done too much Degenerate shit for anybody to care about defending or believing him, i really want the guy gone, he seems like utter trash.
Dream is one of the content creators of all time
Wonder if Dream will hire a microbiologist or a forensic psychologist to help him prove his innocence in all of this nonsense like he attempted when proving his innocence in the cheating allegations…
5:02  i have never heard of that meme.
Wild and Wacky
Talk about the situation in Dublin with the riots
Speaking of which, dream looks kinda like Shane Dawson
gotta talk abt nba player giddey
Respectfully Charlie you’re going to be hearing from my lawyers from these potential dream moans
This is either real or not. That said I don't care if it is fake. It is time to send all the ' evidence ' to the authorities and let them deal with it. If Dream is an alleged pedo then let the alleged pedo spend the rest of his life in prison. If Dream is innocent then let them have access to the ' evidence ' for possible defamation cases after there name is cleared. Either way it needs to be investigated by professionals first.
I’m still stunlocked by the guy passing a kidney stone and cumming at the same time.
Happy Turkey Day, Charlie! My family doesn't normally celebrate Thanksgiving because most of my immediate family was not born here, we have no emotional ties to the holiday, and it's a holiday that I relate to colonization. However, it IS a good point to express being thankful for what we have and for another year of being together. I am thankful for your humor and your videos every day. The depressos is not as bad today - maybe I'm getting better. Keep up the good work and hope you are enjoying the weekend.
"there isn't anything connecting those accounts" except him saying that sharing that video is revenge p0rn/j
Man I used to watch Dream. I'm still in his side, I hope it was all just fake since I wouldnt want there to be any actual victim too. But I hope he'd just learn from his friend George. That guy doesnt have any care about anything, Dream should take a note or two.
I’m thankful
6:19 leaked Charlie moan vid
I remember when Charlie and Dream were both on Train’s podcast and Charlie had red flags back then about Dream.
people definitely do send moaning videos charles
That kitty cat was really slapping the bass! Scared the s*** out of me!
Manhunt won’t be in Minecraft anymore
Who thought that dream would fight gumball😭😭😭
Io mic slap 😎
gumball W
When it comes to the argument of "oh well just because nick was cross faded and underage it doesnt give him an excuse to beat dream" or "well just because nick is pansexual and is bipolar that doesn't make what he said was ok." Those things don't matter, the fact that dream kept that video for a whole year just to throw dirt on nick if he said something, not to mention the fact that nick hit dream because he called one of nicks close friends a whore during a party. And the shit of dream saying "well im a victim of sexual violence too so your all wrong for saying i did this stuff" is quite contradictory considering the fact that he has admitted to making sexual content while being fully aware of his fanbases age, he admitted that the girl who came out and said that he groomed her was underage and that since it said shit about her graduatiing that meant that she was over 18, and ontop of that if someone is going to have a fanbase of any sorts and say this and that to apease to litteral children who want to see him get into gay little relationships with his friends for more views and attention, then he has been in the wrong for a long ass time. If Dream didnt want to constantly be accused of being a pedo then he shouldnt have pulled a Colleen and interacted with his fans in that way. Any person with a audience should know from the start that its never necesarily good to get involved with fans or subscribers.
assuming the allegations against him aren't true, i kinda feel bad for him lol
did you dye your eyebrows
I don't fucking care about dream, but when you have an audience of 30 MILLION of the most rabid people on the planet, you really should be careful about the shit you do. Honestly, with how long he kept that stupid ass face hidden, you'd think he WAS thoughtful about that stuff.
cat
people hate dream LOL
1:05 sounds like nutrition research
Don’t take word for it, but I’m pretty sure Dream admitted that it was him in the audio and that it was sent to an adult.
Happy Thanksgiving, Charlie 😊
I wonder why there was someone below the legal drinking age blackout drunk in your car, dream…?
charlie pretending he cant moan lmao
Dream always striked me as a bit of a creep, or a potential creep at the very least. That said i’m a big advocate of innocent until proven guilty so unless i see some hard evidence other than sketchy clips and recordings that could’ve been altered a million ways, i’m just gonna ignore all this
charlie stop using sharpie markers to draw on your eyebrows (i could never look as majestic as you even on my best day)
God im so glad I don’t have social media. People are just so miserable.
oh hell nah reading comments that the moaning vid is real 😭😭😭😭 god oh why does he sound like that and why did he say those things i cant😭😭😭😭
Dream is finally being brought down. We love to see it
another thing that i hate about the situation is the fact that all the dream stans are trying to defend his actions by using his adhd. i have autism and i am yet to talk to a minor in a sexual way and record an underage drinker having a manic episode. he needs to get off social media immediately
This is why you never trust a grown man making minecraft videos now
Really regretting that face reveal
5:29 (Imagine it actually is real and u are rewatching this video when he is going to jail)
I thought we were done with the Dream drama but here we go again
These kids need Tobuscus, not Dream.
"yes i slapboxed you in front of the hoes" is devastating
Dream should have never showed his face when he can’t survive the consequences of being famous
I think people are forgetting that it was dreams fans that made gumball leave the internet after that massive cyber bullying campaign.
Weirdest thing is I Hope he is a p. Too many accusations of people who aren't leads to real p victims having a harder time.
i love you
Wasn’t dream the dude who revealed his face not that long ago and twitter roasted him?
gotta talk about JOSH GIDDEY
mans shouldve kept his face hidden
This is the second time I’ve been brought to awareness of who Dream is, I literally forgot who he was and even then I didn’t give a fuck about him. Still don’t know what he posts and does for content but all I do hear is just drama the couple times I tune in
Gumball's VA acting this way still comes as a shock to me despite it being so obvious (young actor gets popular at young age) because of how much I associate the cartoon with myself
Charlie´s moaning caught me offguard... I spilled my whole drink over the floor. Pure entertainment!
Glad i'm not those in deep of this guy not saying all minecraft creators are bad and creeps but..... non stop as with the smash scene oh boy non stop of these WHAT THE FUCK MAN!
I don't like dream at all but it's still baffling to me that people hate dream so much to rally around a drunk guy saying slurs and acting like he's a god
Beautiful cat 😻😻
I just happy that more people are acknowledging how much of a creep and asshole Dream is.
Love Nicholas Cantu. Always will could care less what “slurs” he said😂 imo it wasn’t even a bad one
I suppose people have their qualms with Dream, but these pieces of "evidence" and allegations showcased are more like lies and delusions.
ong who cares. it's a minecraft youtuber. end of the day it's bs.
The earth situation is crazy
my thing is why would dream say there was “revenge porn” of him going around if that’s not him in the snapchat videos?? to me that’s him admitting it’s him but idk
WHY IS THIS SO FUNNY
Omg you are jesus because every one you face now has peace with you😮
🌟
What happen to men that dont complain. Looks weak
Bro the world is a strange place
It should be known that Nicolas is autistic, bipolar, and pansexual, which clears him for all slur use.
6:19 to 6:26  is sooo gonna get clipped and memed to death. Mark my words.
The outta conext complationa gonna go crazy with this video
Dream talking about this and not keeping his mouth shut is just making it worse for him
Umm it's not hard to figure out at all, simple put he is a serial F$@k up artist..... Eze peze!
don't think dreams a groomer
yo chat clip moist moaning for 4.2 seconds for research purposes
5:10 charlie goes super saiyan
I find it hard to take anything with dream seriously, do you guys remember before he showed his face some people pretended to dox him and say he was a fat country kid and got a random picture and everyone was flaming it and saying look at your fat hero now and bad mouthing him with no proof, some people are just made to be hated like him, pokimane and Taylor Swift
Io is so fluffy I love her
As a member of the LGBTQ+, I happily condone Nicholas Cantù’s actions because Dream is a creep/p3do.
Now who was first to upload, Pyro or Charlie?
Dream move on already
Dream's about to pull out the architecture professor to prove his innocence
I thought this was the guy who cheated at minecraft
Why you shouldn't waste your time on people who waste their time "gathering evidence" buncha people who know nothing
Dream looks like Mac Tonight lol
twitter is genuinely obsessed with dream. literally the weakest piece of evidence will come out and all of twitter will jump on it and spread it like wildfire. it’s kinda sad how much people want to label him as a groomer, even when the evidence is trash. seems like a kwite situation to me
How hard is it to stay away from kids? Whats going on with all these people
Dream and his fans were always gay loser anyway
welp now i know how sub males sound haha
I’m looking at his part line in his hair and now my brain is flashing bald Charlie and I think I’m going insane from it
nick saying slurs is fine by me because he can reclaim those ones and it was used against dream 🙏
you already know charlie moaning is gonna be in some out of context videos
I think it’s insanely hypocritical for “antis” to say he should just stay quiet and it would go away. He did that when the hate first started and he was branded guilty. People knew the allegations were fake but still it trended and still people began harassing fans and him/his friends. It’s all a giant catch-22 and if people can’t see that, they aren’t being honest with themselves,
it's been awhile since i have seen IO, glad he is doing good
cat.
I have never heard of this person because I'm ancient and I'm not even a little sorry.
5:38 listening to this on speaker, never muted so fast
dream put out a statement not denying the videos, and also calling them "revenge p*rn" - so I'd assume that they are real?
Without Charlie, I'd have no idea who dream is. Thanks I guess.
L dream
ah yes another trendy gaming vid by the infamous moist
Happy thanksgiving 🍁  this drama is wild  but twitter is definitely thankful for the drama they get every day :3
I wonder if people ever get tired of being involved in drama.  I don’t really care about anything that happens haha
You should review how Sniperwolf is now in Dhar Mann now constantly
At this point we should ban people from trying to be minecraft youtubers.
He did say it was "revenge p**n" so that kinda insinuates that it was him.
Thought this was about that new Nic Cage movie.
Happy Thanksgiving brother!
5:01 bro what 💀
When is this dumbass going to realize that it doesn’t many how “wrong” the other guy is. You could replace the gumball va with a murderer and people would still be against him. Nobody cares about what gumball va said, they care that this child touching narcissist is finally getting some of the karma he deserves
Dream ate my goldfish. Add that to the list please.
P L😊p😊p Pp
Dream admitted the videos were real
i would not want to be famous for this reason people are crazy
Happy Thanksgiving to you too Charlie
Hallucination of the reproduction of my birthday in the hospital the bus in the
Charlie, with all due respect this video comes off somewhat ignorant. You haven’t had sexually charged convos with men so how would you know how they act in these situations? For example I met a resident physician (super smart and professional) who ended up telling me his kink was for a girl to be chained up and treated like a dog. I followed him on Twitter and he had all of these know doctors following him, always tweeting and sounding like he was so smart and dignified. Went crazy on the phone about me being put in a cage. Open your mind a bit my guy holy fuck
i find it funny how people will complain about how cancel culture is so bad and every little thing you say could ruin your career forever but then junky here gets away with saying some pretty bad stuff while everyone jumps to defend him
During covid and lockdown I watched his man hunt stuff because it was fun to watch and it was entertaining. I even bought a shirt because I respected the guy for making great content. I see all this stuff and now i don't know what to think.
6:20 Yep im using that one later
My girlfriend half asleep wakes up mid moan...uhh its not what you think 😅
Dont forget that dream was with a drunk 20 year old and let this 20 year old get drunk illegally
I don't care if these allegations are true. I'm just glad I have a more reasons to hate him
Missed opportunity, I'm going to title mine "Dream Situation is a Nightmare. Don't steal it--anyway I think dream is a legit weirdo but I don't know that any of this crazy mess is actual proof of wrong doing really
Had no idea Charlie endorsed Youtubers who molest children. Makes you wonder what else he endorses or actually does behind the scenes……
What I find frustrating is just how every single allegation has been fake until now (except the speedruns, which people should not have cared about as much as they did). His fandom outside of youtube is not “children” young, it’s teens around the age of 14-18, and while the thrist traps are still weird this would also condem people like Corpse, Sapnap, etc. yet Dream is the only one being accused.   The m0aning audio does not sound like him and is very likley fake.   The hate against him is severely undeserved, blown out of proportion and insanely chronically online. No kid should have his life threatened for watching a youruber who cheated TWICE (?) on a MINECRAFT SPEEDRUN. like that’s actually insane.   He’s a punching bag who tries defending himself because when he doesn’t, people automatically brand him as guilty. Theres so many people who are GUILTY and do not get the hate he does. It sucks.
Just another Minecraft YouTuber happened before and it’s gonna happen again
Let's be real, he's just salty about getting his ass beat by gumball watterson
he didn't at all even DENY that the moaning video was him and that says a lot.
Is court that expensive that all that there ever is are accusations?
In any case I'll never forgive Dream for leaving a stain on minecraft.
Disappointed in you for making a video this terrible, we can tell you put no effort into researching what happened because the situation is much worse than you’re pretending it is. We need to stop pretending this guy is a good commentary YouTuber.
Io became so big 😂😭😍
Your bazillion butt surgery is a go ,,,,♡ love steve♡
WHAT A CUTE KITTY MOISTT
Charlie got them Rock Lee eyebrows
I saw this video pop up in my notifications and I thought "finally someone can explain what the hell is going on" and then I realized charlie is just as clueless as I am lmao
4:08 dream literally confirmed that those moans were from him in his own tweet addressing this video....
"Dream"...more like "Nightmare" 😅 cringe af!
I shouldn't be laughing at this, but I was not prepared at all for 6:12 to 6:24 ~ish voice acting. Marvelous, Charlie! Marvelous!! I almost spit my dinner here, thanks! Happy thanksgiving!
Charlie's cat looks so cute and fluffy
disgusting fortune.
Ahhh I was just wondering why I haven't heard anything of that guy for a while... It was a matter of the quiet before the storm.
I feel like dream would be way to smart to send inappropriate videos to a minor with all of the memes about minecraft youtubers going after minors he would be on high alert to specifically not do that.
you said it yourself - the dude's a narcissist...they tend to be pedos...
this is the 3rd time dream has been accused of accusations. Considering this can we assume if it happens a 4th time we take it seriously and actually investigate him because it can't be all fake all the time.
i was not expecting to hear male moaning in a Moist video.
Typical pyro stealing yet another critikal video
Waiting for the Harvard astrophysicist to disprove the grooming/having sexual conversations with minors with a 20 page thesis.
I mean, that's what the point of the mask is
Happy turkey day 😋
"I can't breath when your not there" Charlie ...panic attack 🎶🎵
Looks like this Dream… became a nightmare.
It is NOT, I repeat NOT Common place to send shit like that😂  If you do this, we do not claim you as a man😂
i wish charlie would've gone through everything. the nat situation with dream still refusing to admit he lied about it, dream admitting the videos were him in that slander, the fact he said nic had a fake ID and he just... didn't say anything to the people serving drinks. charlie missed A LOT this time and i hope he does his research and says something. he's usually great about admitting to mistakes - lets keep that up.
Dream is a fucking nightmare.
Dream does not post thirst traps wtf you talking about
The ability people on the internet have to manipulate information into looking true and extremely disgusting towards someone and having the entire planet back them simply because they found the person annoying at one point is pretty impressive
Been waiting for this vid
sports fans💅🏻
Ever since he showed his face he's been taking L after L.
Imagine getting cooked by a black out drunk and manic 19 year old Watterson
I like how we all just accept the cat thing with Shane Dawson as a fact. 😭 I even had a dream once where I woke up with the clear thought in my head, "I heard Shane Dawson let Jake Paul fuck his cat" like it's just that real, it's permeating the collective consciousness 😭😭😭
A child oriented minecraft youtuber potentially being a creepy pedo? Oh no, say it ain't so 🙄
Everyone here saying that if he didn’t respond nothing would have come with it clearly don’t get the gist of how much Dream is hated. You know what’s sad? The hate started because much like Kick is now, twitch used to be bigoted and full of incels. Anyone who used twitch back in the day knows what I’m talking about. When he entered the scene he was getting attacked by those people because they didn’t want anyone who was open to do something different, and that’s where the hate started. It became a whole shit storm when people who didn’t know him began to see the allegations and lies made by people who hated him, hence why a lot of people hate him and when you ask why they always give you a different reason. I hope that his video clears things up, and people only hate him because they find him cringe not because of allegations against him.
Fuck the Video, look how cute this pets are!!
McDonal.
Happy Thanksgiving Charles 😁
I never gave a f about dream personally or even knew who he was. That's more or a minecraft kids thing.
The soy-virgin mask music guy vs. The Chad Gumball Watterson
Just so everyone knows: all the slurs ncantu said he was allowed to day as he is both neurodivergent and pansexual
I've always wondered if the face reveal broke his spirit completely.
Dream's turning into a nightmare
Bro thirst traps are everywhere on the internet
If Charlie is covering it, I'm listening.
"And here's the evidence for that" I knew I was about to lose my sht laughing.
My kitty ran away today :(
As a son of someone with bipolarity I have 0 simpathy for maniacs
I remember awhile ago watching the videos he did where some friends would hunt him down in Minecraft. I thought they were a cool watch and just kinda moved on to other stuff and didn’t think much of it. Wild to think it’s that same dude at the center of all this garbage lmao.
He dreaming of catching a case💀
Lol dream got clocked by Gumball, very funny stuff
I've got to hand it to Charlie, he somehow made a ten minute video rambling on about something that could've been summarised in two minutes and I've no doubt this video will go on to be one of his most viewed.
twitter is mad at you for this video lmaoo
Imagine beefing with Leonardo/ Gumball 💀 dude should hire a Harvard professor
Oh hell nah
You look so good bae 😻😻😻
how did he even end up with the va?
Remember when he is at his peak he made a sarcastic comment about PewDiePie being the one who uses him for clickbait now that he is big. Now he is having a taste of what the burden of being big is really like.
i don't even care about him i've never been curious enough to see who he is or what he does
I feel like the one thing that can confirm the moaning clip of dream was dream himself not denying it and instead saying he never did anything bad or weird with minors and Idrc but like it does seem the evidence is true
he confirmed it was him in the snap when he went live on twitch like last week. he denied that it was sent to a minor tho- stating that it was actually sent to his gf at the time. his whole story is that this is just some big plot to take him down and the video is actually "revenge porn". crazy ass situation
I thought he was saying boning videos until halfway through this vid
Why is the second chapter of the video names Mazda Miata?😂 I tapped the screen and thought I was on a different video by accident😂
I've been saying for a while now "This whole situation is crazy i'll just wait for Critikal to make a video about it before forming my own opinion." Here it is, time to judge accordingly.
Your cat is sooo cute ❤❤❤🥰🥰🥰🥰
It’s pronounced mewing videos
I was only into Dream for about roughly a year before I grew out of him. I think it was like 2 or 3 months before the cheating scandal started that I stopped watching him. Not due to hatred of the guy, just I grew tired of his content (and come to think of it, I just got burnt out on Minecraft YouTube in general). Good thing I never established some parasocial bond with him. Never even subscribed while I was watching him.
Need to bleach my eardrums after hearing Dream moan
I am really starting to think all these Minecraft Yt are really hiding something deep and dark or have alibi.
I can’t wait until Charlie is embroiled in a legit scandal and he does a video on himself from the 3rd person lol
Thank you man you too cuz🫨🥸🥺😇😮‍💨😓🎃😯🤭🫥😬🤯;)
Common dream W
All of this...just from A FACE REVEAL, Cthulhu is the Internet 😂
Twitter threads? Not a reliable source of information? 🤯I am most shocked.
That random snapchat video ruined my Thanksgiving.
Thanksgiving was like a month ago
who tf are these people
People really out here defending Cantu. Both of them are wrong. Doesn't matter if you're drunk or high or not. Go to rehab and stop drinking or smoking if you can't control yourself from being physically or verbally abusive
If Dream just admitted he cheated he would have got less hate since then. Everyone hates lying little rats and I along with others would have had a bit more respect if he admitted it. People see you lying about something that isn't that big of a deal and an obvious conclusion is this person is a piece of shit what else are they lying about.
Dream farted in my face and gave me pink eye after fondling my balls and calling me his "good little kitty slut"
Wait, you don't all have broken families and are enjoying Thanksgiving?
Charlie moaning sounds like me coughing after ripping a blinker
During the day: 16-year old stuck in a grown man's body During night: Grown man's body stuck in a 16-year old
"Dream, if you're innocent, then send us your mods folder."
Why is ur channel just a drama channel now
God I’ve been waiting for you to talk about this😩
well whatever the answer is I still don't like him
If you told me years ago that in 2023, Dream would end up in a drama with Gumball Watterson of all people, I would probably laugh at you.
dream is so boring
Any other influencers get accused of grooming children and their fan base immediately turns on them. Dream gets accused of grooming kids and his fanbase goes “so you’re telling me there’s a chance.”
thank you for talking about this I was hoping you would notice that
U should start a wacky Wednesday where ever Wednesday day u cover the most wacky thing u could fined
So sad Charlie didn’t bring up Gumball’s VA roasting tf outta Dream. Bro said “you gonna hire a math professor on how you hit up every female streamer in Austin yet none of them replied”
6:19 Charlie did WHAT?!
Wtf dream I ain't reading allat
I can't blame anyone for not liking the guy he has been a creep. Dream has been in the wrong so many times that I don't doubt that the claims are real. Honestly sad
1:09 I never expected a video about a MC YouTuber to perfectly sum up the problems with the fnaf lore
been waiting for this video
See I don’t like Dream. I think he’s cringe. But his inability to shut up and move on (like Boogie2988) makes him so much worse.
Important context that I think is being left out but I don’t blame Charlie, Dream did confirm those moaning audios/videos were real but is claiming that said videos are revenge porn from an adult he sent them to, however, said adult had screen recorded their conversations to prove they weren’t the one that received them and posted them on their Twitter account, and the account of the alleged victim (Jamie) do exist and have existed for four years now, with that in mind it’s hard to believe Dream is innocent especially when he has gone out of his way to find receipts for his fight with Cantu within days, yet has shown no receipts at all to show his innocence from the allegations from a year ago.  Ps. The fake allegations Charlie is talking about are ones coming from a burner account made yesterday from a troll, with fake screenshots and messages that have no correlation to the original burner that posted the moaning videos.
The wild part of the Dream situation is that if he just didn't respond to any of it and just put his phone down, hardly anybody would know about it and it wouldn't be nearly as big of a deal. Him responding on main is how I even found out about it in the first place.
Schrodinger's cat paradox is being tested to the absolute limit with this situation.
Ive been waiting for this vid!!
Get ready for Charlie’s moaning being taken out of context
i can slowly feel charlie's brain spasming out while recording this video
This is what happens if you teach your audience to not take your normal pills.
Idk why but everytime Dream is involved in any drama it just spirals out of control so fast it's amazing
I haven't looked at the full thing, but what annoys me is that Dream called out Gumball's VA a racist and people were attacking Dream saying he was racist too, so shut up.  I'm not here to defend Dream, nor am I going to defend Gumball's VA, but I will say, just because someone is an alleged racist, doesn't mean they can't call out another alleged racist. Sure, it's hypocritical, but if the person is allegedly being racist, anyone can call it tf out.  Also, if your response to someone calling out a racist and saying "Oh, but you're one too" and completely ignoring the other person, then you don't actually care about racism, you just care about making the person you dislike look bad. As a POC, I am real sick and tired of people calling out racists, but then when someone they like is being racist, they just turn a blind out.
0:30 that was gold 😭
I encourage everyone reading this comment to go do your own research. This video is poorly researched and misrepresents the situation. But, if you want a tldr, here it is.  Dream was outed a while ago for soliciting nudes from minors, there was some pretty definitive proof yet nothing came of it.  Recently A dream parody account as well as Nicolas Cantu started beefing with dream, dream released a video of nick having a manic episode while drunk as a "gotcha" moment, it failed. An underage victim of dreams then released a video of dream moaning, and dream released a statement that was just him yapping and that's where we are now.
Goddam bruh Ive been a sub for years when did you get 14 mil subs
To anyone who doesn’t like Charlie “defending” this, you have to remember that almost every time some celebrity or internet influencer is accused of this stuff many people automatically assume they are guilty. That’s not always the case
its common charlie like very--
Sadly. Guys like that do exist irl
Off topic but Io's coat is so healthy and full! So well cared for ahh remember when she was jus a scrawny kitten
very important to take into account: dream confirmed the snapchats are real. the point of contention is he claims he sent them to someone over 18, while the person posting them claims they were sent to a 16-year-old instead
Some people straight up fabricated things. Also to note that he doesn't stop responding and he gets into a deeper hole my acknowledging it. Oh the irony.
Honestly, even if the allegations were false, Dream doesn't deserve his platform simply because of how he handles shit like this. He acts like an arrogant asshole because he knows his fans are his attack dogs online.
You'd think a manipulative narcissist would be good at being that, but Dream has the worst case of verbal diarrhea I've ever seen on Twitter right now.
Forget harassing kids, his face reveal criminally assaulted the senses of everyone who laid eyes on his ugly mug.
Never heard of him tbh lol
You are going to have a lot of views
This will be made into a TAWoG episode
Yippie, another huge vid from Dream to prove his innocence!! maybe he will hire another mathematician to see what the chances of these claims being true are
Is... is that jesus
Can you make a video about the dublin riots
Ykw is funny, Nicholas (gumball) is only around 19, now I’m not so sure about laws but I think ur 21 and up to drink in America and I find it more weird how dream is filming this young guy drunk while dream is above the drinking age
this has childish vibes, ngl... like  those discord server chatters having no life and making up dramas because they are bored af
Those moans from Charlie 😅
Holy shit everyone in this comment section is so anti-dream it’s hilarious.   When you get enough info on this matter you will come to realize everyone in this drama is the bad guy. Dream just wasn’t the person to start it.
Is it crazy tho?
twitter making up false allegations is not surprising.
You did not have make us hear the moaning 😭😭😭
I’m not surprised Penguinz0 called this one out, he’s gonna find all the events
U are kinda narcicist too, but in a pasive agresive way
THANKS for GIVING me this video to watch.... Now I'm going to play leagues
Just saying. The girlies prefer audio than crusty duck pics
IO!!!! I LOVE Io
Kenekokittien drama 💀
I mean it's completely fair to want the complete and unobscured truth when it comes to accusations as serious as these  At the same time, how can anyone be surprised of this shit when Dream literally modeled his entire internet persona after a groomer, AFTER the grooming accusations and evidence were already released to the public? That's not someone anyone with respect for any potential young audience does. Dream never respected his audience.
I’m 31 and have had sex before. What the fk is Dream
Dreams biggest mistake is selling his soul to social media
6:00
The Snapchat audios could be referred to as Schrödinger’s pepdophile
Infinite content glitch “_ situation is crazy”
i cant belive how big his cat has gotten feels like i watched the kitten video a few months ago
Charlie, inform yourself. He quite LITERALLY ADMITTED TO IT
i will say, nicholas can say the f slur as he is part of the lgbtq community (he is pansexual) but i will say just cause you can say a slur does not mean you should, but again he was under the influence and quite possibly even having a manic episode (not excusing the fact he said it)
yeah this video needed more context
He should just shut up and stop bringing attention to this "drama" that he keeps fueling himself and its makes him look even more annoying everytime he tweets a 500 word assay instead of working on his damn videos!
The gumball thing was beyond weird. Dream was being cancelled; gumball called him a p3d0 on twitter. Then dream decided it was time to cancel gumball? For things dream himself has done in the past as well? Reminds how he tried to cancel quackity or the people that caught him cheating in speedruns. He needs to get his priorities straight.
Charlie’s moan was easily 10/10
i love that cat
Hey moist have you heard about the riots in dublin Ireland
I love you Charlie
This is even more confusing than the movie Tenet.
YES IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
I mean this is something he’d do lol
have a great thanksgiving
nicolas is pan, aka queer, so hes allowed to say the f slur. my friends and i (all queer) will say it and dont care that he does. as for the r slur, as far as we know, hes autistic and therefore can say that word. i am too, but i personally just dont like to. it depends on the person. and im sure dream is lying about him saying the n slur 😐😐  the REAL problem regarding nicolas here is dream recording a manic and drunk minor (under 21). we dont know if dream supplied him with alcohol, but its suspicious regardless. and even if he didnt, its so *disgusting* to record someone like that and keep it for blackmail just in case he gets into drama so he can deflect it onto someone else who doesnt deserve it
dream is completely in the wrong here but that nicolas dude has a massive ego. him saying he was like a michelangelo😆 he dont even compare to michelangelo, however, he was high and drunk though so i hope he dont actually believe that. still dream is a massive creep 100% in the wrong here
horrible take bro. horrible.
I guess Dream can only Dream about getting out of petty drama.
Damn you Charlie I was wearing gloves while listening to you in the background when you played dream moaning and I couldn’t take them off in time to pause it
A nightmare. A nightmare.
Happy thanksgiving mah boi
This situation would be so funny if it wasn’t related to grooming
6:19 made me fail No Nut November
What’s even crazier is that he apologized a bunch to Dream and the driver since he was having an episode, tipped the driver a ton for dealing with him, and dream STILL kept the video to blackmail him down the line if he ever spoke out against him. Dream is not a good person even with the majority of these accusations being false.
got jump scared by dream moaning audio 😭
Techno watching from heaven, hes wondering wtf happened
We know 6:18 is gonna be clipped
This Gumball dude seems like an awfull person
6:18 clip that CLIP THAT
This talking about other streamers and people is getting a bit old lately. They suck we know lol. Came in hoping for a nice Thanksgiving post lol. you should play south park 64 turkey level instead lol.
I dont even care about any drama he's involved in.  And the reason is simple: His cheating in the MC speedruns.  To an extent, I can understand people cheating to create a followership, in order to make money.  Somebody that cheats that already has one of the  biggest fcking communities in the entire existence of the god damn internet, does it for pride and greed. And if somebody possesses those character traits, they're already on the list of people I will never trust or give a fck about ever again.  And the video that calculated his speedruns mathematically, made it very clear that he either cheated, or was the luckiest person in the history of mankid, multiplied by a number I probably cant even pronounce...  That being said, those accusations have to be professionally investigated, and proved without reasonable doubt, like the best law system imo, the US law system, demands. Cuz allegations like that are some of the worst you could ever bring against somebody. But if it is proven, I hope he gets punished to the full extent of the law, because it's disgusting.
Charlie giving us free audio clips of him moaning 🧐
BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
It’s hard to believe who is telling the truth because we’ve already seen so many YouTubers, a lot of Minecraft ones, being guilty of this. It’s hard not to have confirmation bias in something like this
this is where i am grateful i don't watch dream and watch the brazillian portuguese dub for gumball
I’m not saying he’s innocent but man, with the advancement of AI, it’s a possibility to just generate a sound with a sample of his voice. I don’t really tune in with this whole drama for his, clearly people hated his entire existence but yeah there’s not enough incriminating evidence. And I won’t just bandwagon with the majority that already locked in that he’s a devil. If he is true evil, more definitive evidence will come out and not just some low level stuff that anyone can fabricate.
some guy sent me a video of him moaning once, it was extremely weird and embarrassing lol
Why is everyone turning out to be pedophiles.
Off topic, but it’s scary because, with the advancement of AI, people can fabricate anything. And everyone would just believe it without a second thought. The future is depressing af...
To not start this with the voice actor of gumball slapping him and then ranting an Uber bout it is crazy
dream himself confirmed the videos were real. his claim is that they were sent to an adult. the problem with that claim is that the adult already proved dream never sent her those messages.   the only logical conclusion is that he did in fact send them to a 16 year old girl.
W Gumball
If it’s true or not idc I’m backing my boy gumball 💪
his credibility is so bad because he only ever confirms things (the video) or fully denies things (older allegations) on his private twitter with mostly fans there. it gets spread around quickly. but saying that in a private account makes you look so much worse. why are you doing this on a private account instead of putting it on your alt or in a video that has been promised for a bit. and him reacting irrationally doesnt help either. hes a lost cause, hes done too much damage to his reputation for non fans to believe him. and as a previous fan (knew his stuff since 10k) i have to say i had to leave his content and fandom because of how im not sure hes telling the truth.
I haven’t enjoyed a thanksgiving for years. My stomach hurt so bad today I couldn’t leave the bathroom and was in a bath for 99% of the day. I can’t take much more of this bs
his whole audience is children. the allegations & drama all involve kids, perpetuated by kids. you're right; he's a narcissist. he deserves all this crap cause it's all his own goddamned fault.
This video is poorly informed, fence sitting slop. You’re an awful commentator and you need to research your sources more thoroughly and handle discussing topics like this better.
The gumball guy seemed like a dick...
YOOOOO ITS A CAT, CAT GAMING
Dude's been losing since his face reveal.
Bro an ad before the video, 2 and a half minutes in, and 5 minutes in…. I can’t continue watching lmao fuck YouTube
You should get out of the house charlie
The fact that the voice of Gumball literally just destroyed Dream’s career, it’s insane
I was disappointed when I clicked on this that it wasn’t a Sumito video
Tf is a thirst trap?
6:19 for anybody who needs it ;)
All these online personalities have kids as fans. The kids idolize them. Dm them. And they'd do anything to just be near them. The temptation is there for them 24/7. Just don't engage with anyone underage.
1:10 twitter in a nutshell
Dream has not only lost the script, but the entire damn plot if he's seriously out here comparing real domestic violence with getting slapped by a kid you just met who had his first beer.
Bro said basically nothing in 10 minutes
thank you charlie for this gamer video, I am glad it is now #7 on Trending for Gaming
NOT YOU PLAYING THE AUDIO
Hearing Charlie scream or make these sounds is scary
For many of you who may not know Using bots to create tons of fake accusations is actually an efficient way to help someone get out of some drama/accusation   Like a lot of Vtubers who partner with some media company,  it is common for their company to do that when there are drams that impact the revenue they gain from the Vtuber just make absolutely fake accusations, then people will think this is just people;e trolling, and disbelieve the true accusation towards the Vtubter
yes cantù’s a dick, but he knows he is. also, he’s really fucked up right there
Yeah I've been crossfaded lots of times you don't just start saying awful shit because of that so I think that guy is definitely just a dick but seems like Dream is too lol
ppl
6:19 Charlie needs to be stopped
I think charlie should do more research than uploading a have assed one
WHY DID HE CONFIRM THE MOANS 1. IM FUCKING NAUSEOUS BRO BRO BRO EUGH I CANT 2. ITS A BLCK SCREEN BRO NOBODY KNEW IT WAS YOU 💀💀💀 3. NOW THEY ONLY NEED TO PROVE IT WAS SENT TO A MINOR LIKE BRO YOURE SO STUPID
cantu is also pan and in the spectrum
I still cant believe people watch other people play Minecraft online ..........
Dream admitted to the moan shit, pretty bad ikr
Dream confirmed the video was him but he said he sent it to his ex. His ex came out and said that wasn’t true
godbless can2
Just as a side note, Nicolas cantu is actually pansexual and neurodivergent so the slurs he said aren’t actually as bad
Nogla & Terroriser Called It🤝
Nick definitely is innocent there, dream took nick out to get drunk while nick was underage, obviously he was not gonna be able to handle himself while drunk well.
its fine next episode will start like nothing ever happened and dream will continue his grooming adventures
I never liked nor trusted Dream
Anyone who uses snapchat over the age of 19 is a certified creep in my books
Dream getting cooked by gumball is the funniest shit I've seen this year
OH MY GOD KITTY PLEASANT SURPRISE
A bloody battle.
but isn’t this the same video he said he’s been making to prove he’s innocent for a whole year now ??
this is why he should have stayed faceless so nobody could frame him etc
What if we had like, a system of courts to decide who's guilty instead of Twitter?
This Dream guy is cringe, who tf is even dream?
FINALLY
😂😂 dude is trying to play victim to get pity points and it's not working
Lmao Shane Dawson catching strays out here 😂 What a blast from the past mentioning the cat 😂
Let's see how Dream will Speedrun his way out of this one
Happy Thanksgiving Charlie
Happy Thanksgiving Charlie
Charlie not believing that some men randomly send moaning clips to people is quite wholesome. He has clearly never seen the sh*t people send on Snapchat and I respect that.
Holy shit is that cat that baby one you got ages ago? The dude g r e w! SHEESH
I demand more IO in videos
I thought dream had died from ligma
Hang on a second, you're telling me there are actually people still using Twitter?
The problem with some of these comments from what Ive been reading is that hating Dream is just a trend, so even when another party is wrong, the internet just sees it as a loss against Dream. Like I dont even like or watch him anymore but its insane to me that someone could assault him and its a Dream L just because people hate him lol. Like I know Nicholas was drunk and all that but in a NORMAL situation, he'd be wrong for what he did, but because its against Dream, "he deserved it, he did nothing wrong". From an outside perspective, thats wild lol.  I'm pretty much in the same boat as Charlie though in that I need concrete evidence instead of nearly baseless accusations and "evidence" presented so far. The amount of misinformation spreading is wild, even in some of the comments here. They take something that was said at face value and roll with it as fact when we either dont know exactly what happened or spin it for their own narrative.  Either way, it IS a fact that Dream has just not been handling this well at all. He should just focus on the response video and stop engaging with twitters morons that'll eat anything up. If hes innocent, hes innocent. If hes guilty, hes guilty and thats that. Ill just move on with my life lol.  (Edit: grammer)
minecraft is the single most convincing proof for me to know what allegations are real
dude needs to just ignore all the hate he gets lmao, by reacting and feeding into it, the people who hate him get what they want, a reaction
the video is dream. he said it in his new tweet, unless hes going crazy or something idk. theres no proof he sent it to minors tho
Charlie moaning is the best but scariest thing I’ve heard.
happy thanks giving charlie.
The brows going crazy
Voice actors trying not to ruin their show through off-platform behavior challenge: IMPOSSIBLE
5:01 “Classic Meme”  *Never in my life have I heard of that meme* 💀💀
We counting that money for fun
Charlie is just asking for TikTok edits to be made of him moaning 😭
5:06  Dbz Screaming guide by Penguinz0
I swear if i had a dollar for every Youtuber and Influencer grooming or doing "SOMETHING" with kids, i would probably be able to live happily, which is FUCKED UP.
Charlie your hair looks extra luscious today❤
I fucking love gumball idc
I just know the apology video is gonna be absolutely nothing
Hes a Minecraft Youtuber........he is obviously a "PDF File". Being a Pedo is literally part of the job💀
I liked it charlie 🤣🤣
I hate that I know about this. I'm not even a fan of Dream, Gumball, Minecraft, or any of the Minecraft community. 😑
all i see in my head is a drunk aged up gumball having a breakdown
I don't particularly like or not like Dream. I only know about him because of my kid. I hope his video involves ukelele, though.
imma be real with dream, if i got bitchslapped by someone and the one who did it fcking admit it and I still got hated, I don't see how I can win this battle
@4:05 what absolute f*ck
Not gonna lie nick was being turbo cringe with how superior and elevated he was describing himself to be. Complete loser just like dream, both are trash.
Omg my comment got removed because i said dream wasn't the best looking. YouTube is so soft!!!!
gumball watterson on  top
Smelly Dream real
Why the heck is everyone getting outted as a pedo 😭
heard about this earlier, crazy crazy situation
I thought this was a review of Nick Cage's new movie Dream Scenario.
Edging to Charlie’s moan
Could give less of a shit about all the hate dream gets, guys is so unlikable and slimy in any way and anywhere
Honestly didnt even know Dream was still around after the speedrun cheating scandal and his cringy song 'What the mask is' or whatever its called.
I don't like Dream any more than the next guy. But if he was recorded drunk and high like that, everyone would go to town on him. He's getting shorted, and that's unacceptable, even for someone I dislike.
CAT
I like to believe victims first but, all these allegations don't have soild concrete proof. I don't like Dream, never did and I find him weird af. It's hard to figure out what's real and what isn't
happy thanksgiving!
6:19 highlight
So I think it should be clarified, the snaps have been clarified by dream himself to be him, though he claims he sent it to someone over the age.
ill make them my breeders hahah
did charlie just defending dream 😵
What Dream is being accused of; flirting with his fans that are kids.  What Dream openly admits; that he has flirted with fans, but that they weren't kids  Why this is blowing up so much;  Dream fans used to fully defend him regardless of what he did due to high parasocial levels. But people eventually grow up. This be a parasocial whiplash.
"You will be nothing more than a grain of sand in the sahara and i will have a statue of gold erected in my image 🔥✍️" - nick "gumball" cantu.
I thought it was gonna be FilthyFrank for a moment there when Charlie started moaning lol 0-0
I’ve never noticed before but Charlie’s eyebrows be on fleek
ThAnKsGiViNg No.
Ohhh, he's ignoring the actual evidence for people tweeting about said evidence. Gotcha. L moment.
All of my family celebrated their thanksgiving without me, but I’ve got you boys. Happy thanksgiving y’all. Much ❤
I haven’t gone in depth on this yet  i have waited for you to talk about this i am so fucking hyped thank you charlie❤️
Didn't he confirm he was actually the one moaning there? Like jeez, why would you even make a video while you bussin
It’s gotta be exhausting for Dream to be constantly and needlessly arguing with thousands of people at once on Twitter simultaneously. He just needs to learn how to ignore people, all they want is a reaction from him. Not sure how he hasn’t realized that yet.
i think everyone should stop playing minecraft after they graduate high school
What if dream created those fake accounts, actually sent those moans to minors and made them look legit fakes in order to get away with it. Big brain
All your points are valid, but I gotta say.... when you were mimicking the moaning, you sounded a little like Stewie, LMAO!
Charlie brutally executes his animals at 0:11
I find it hilarious that somebody like Charlie has no idea about the whimper audio senders
Happy thanks giving Charlie!!
My favourite part about Dream was when he did a face reveal and all the teenage girls discovered he was mostly chin and his views fell by 95 percent overnight and never recovered :)
Dunno about the dream situation, but this video is definitely going to lead to multiple moist out of context clips 😅
Is he gonna hire a mathematician for his vid?
Mr. Moon chin lookin’ ass is funny and I enjoy watching people make fun of him Also, really, W H Y do giant YouTubers almost always end up diddling kids? It’s actually mind-blowing
My soul left my body when the moaning video played.  Why would charlie do this to us? I feel like ripping my ears out.
1:42 so so many people make alt accounts for more and more drama literally I knew a guy who had 68 twitter accounts just to target jelly bean and make allegations
Minecraft youtubers trying not to be pedophiles challenge (impossible).
lets be real we all know these allegations are true he just seems weird as hell
I’m seriously loosing on my 2023 bingo
Im glad you’ve talked about this situation. Sucks it gonna to ruin some people’s thanksgiving 💀💀
I cant breed when youre not theeere
Dream’s just kind of a man child who can’t ignore petty drama, he’s just digging himself an early grave the more he tries to get into it.
why are we mad at dream, this dude was being a POS, good leak that shit, fuck that other guy
bro fix your camera
Let's pray to God Charlie moaning won't become a meme......
GUMBALL SOCIETY
Twitter...the only place where they want to "cancel" anyone for saying anything that they don't agree with/is really fucked up (even if it's a joke)....  But when someone ACTUALLY says the shit they're against, they team up with him because they just don't like the other person LOL. I don't like Dream either, but imagine being that hypocritical?Social media in general has become a blight where people think they're in the right because other people agree with them. It's kind of a joke at this point but also kind of scary knowing people are willing to fight/kill for their opinion's to be the "correct one" at any cost.
6:19 Yes, it's this one right here, Officer.
Happy thanksgiving charlie
Charlie roaring is crazy
Someone tried to bring this up to me and I stopped him and said I would just wait till the critical video comes out
what is thanksgiving? some murrican thing?
What on gods green earth did I listen to halfway into this video
Dream is old enough to ignore stuff and stop arguing with teenagers (most of the trolls) online 😭😭
5:11 bro is turning super sayian
Dream Dream is dream's alt account. It used to be his main. The audio was sent to a person when she was a minor. The audio file was from that person who was asked for the evidence through DM's
Oompaville did a good job of going through stuff
Its crazy how he takes that specific clip from a video that he recorded that could've easily had more shit against dream is crazy
HE admitted the moans are his, Charlie. He called that ''revenge pr0n''. He claims that. You didn't dig deep enough.
Hey Charlie, if possible can you make a video about the riot in Dublin?
Happy Thanksgiving everyone! Sorry that today’s episode was a Dream video.
The sheer amount of allegations against dream AND PROOF and also him ADMITTING to some of it is insane. Dream doesn’t deserve the platform he has  Also not gonna lie kinda disappointed in this video from Charlie we have evidence of the Snapchat account being dream from fan interactions with him on Snapchat and more
At this point i think i feel bad for dream
In my dorm room with no friends, no family, no food. Good times :/
This is the greatest confusing situation of All Time
Bro....no offense but charlie has been wrong so many times i dont even watch his shid anymore. His content has become the same..and his rhetoric is the same. Not talkin about this video....just him in general. With peace and love.
Charlie when a YouTuber is a pedo: Crazy Charlie when a Streamer sells expensive cookies: Horrible  lmao be a little less blatant with your grifting to incels Charles
5:11 HEKP IM LAUGHING SO BAD LAM4OKOOOOOO
Moist
CAT IN THE INTRO W
I haven't trusted Dream since he cheated in that Minecraft speedrun
Happy Thanksgiving, Charlie. You’re videos ALWAYS make my day better, no matter how good or bad it already is. We’re all thankful for you, man.
I don't think Dream is outright a horrible person but I truly believe he's a dumbass. This is why you need a manager to and even a lawyer when you get into a high reputation status like this without any experience to interact with the public. He truly act like a child that got his hand on the internet for the first time or something.
i want to pet dog
Gumball right hook waterson
seeing the gumball vs dream discourse on twitter was so funny, seeing it happen in real time and i just see posts like “the lgbtq+ community forgives gumball”
My birthday was today and I'm glad you made video on this crap
6:15 I mean yeah but edp sent dook pics so who’s the wiser 🤷‍♂️
bruh why you have to add the moaning 💀💀💀
I will have to say another way to prove the video is fake you can easily edit someone's name on Snapchat
I have noticed thus stuff and couldn't figure it out so I legit waited for this video. The only channel I trust.
I believe that dreams probably acting inappropriate but he's not a chomo, atleast I hope not
only thing is that you failed to mention dream admitted the audio was real when he told people to stop spreading his  “revenge porn” , but just denied the fact he sent it to a minor. otherwise great video charles
Your cat and dog are so cute 🫶
cat cat
Mans entire career is built on drama
No, those snapchat moans were real, but he says they were to his "legal age" ex.
We live in the age of ai and ai voice generation. I dont think i have to say more
Dude was knee deep in internet culture for most of his adult life, so he never had the chance to actually mature
me and my sister used to watch  Him I was 7 years old
I remember when my Terminally Horny Ex cheated on me with a Guy that sends Audio Recordings like these of him moaning while Masturbating.  Ah, good traumatic times for me when I caught both of them on the act…
With great power comes great minor responsibilities. It seems like being a streamer these days you could be famous overnight for some reasons or another nowadays lol, everyone becoming internet FBIs trying to cancel out each other faces. Too much money, too much free time.
To think that Dream would get into a fight against Gumball
Although it’s infuriating to see people calling you something that u may or may be not. Just speaking out against  every single person isn’t worth it cause Ludwig explained it best at one point you are going to crack and say something out of pocket and then it’s just more ammo for the rest of Twitter. The man’s biggest flaw is that he doesn’t have a lid and just react to an action. Like ignore it and don’t let some petty stuff get to u. I wish I could scream it at that guys face so he can post that vid and move on to make more vids. Cause I know they are people willing to watch his content.
A simple way to debunk the snapchats videos and alleged messages is just show the chats, not the video, show the chat history as well.
Y'know... This is really reminiscent of like... a 4chan attack. Like, a group of people thinking they're doing vigilante justice over the internet by making up fake shit about someone "evil" in order to get them completely canceled. And then, by saturating the situation with tons of conflicting viewpoints and new "evidence" they hope to trick people into believing this shit. And since everyone already knows Dream is a piece of shit, the bar for proof is a lot lower for many people.   The fact that there's so many conflicting viewpoints and shaky evidence should be red flag #1 that this is all made up to incriminate Dream. Then Dream's haters jump in with "yeah that sounds like dream alright" and dream stans jump in with "no dream is the next messiah" and while everyone is fighting with each other, they just drop _more_ accusations to keep the fire burning under Dream's ass.
It’s absolutely insane how there are 55k likes on tweets that are straight up lies
whos dream?
I'd recommend watching a video by TheGamerFromMars that talks about Dream. Currently it's 6 months old now but it'll go more into the other stuff about Dream that's terrible
Charlie's moaning sounded like the grape lady from back in the day hahaha
I have no idea who any of these people are, but this story is pretty interesting.
Gumball spittin
I never watched Minecraft content, but when I was big into speedrunning like Charles here, I enjoyed some of his Speedrunner vs hunter videos. It’s a shame everything that has happened, I always hope that no minors are being harassed, but after he cheated on Minecraft and got all weird I wouldn’t be surprised
Don’t forget Dream lied about his speed runs
Is Dream a pedo? Thats all I keep hearing
I believe dream called the moaning vid revenge porn which to me implies that is IS infact him and him not rlly saying anything abt the pedo stuff and focusing more on gumball is fully making me think hes actually a pedo. dream fans are trying their best to defend him and im guessing making fake twitter accounts (though i cant prove that) since that is quite an immature thing to do and as u said he has a relatively young audience. you could say im biased because i dislike dream already for his ableism and racism but hey if ur both of those things thennn youre not a very good person to begin with.
At least to me, the wording of Dream's response tweet does confirm he sent that moaning audio. He called the moaning audio "revenge porn". That's not even what revenge porn is, but even if it was, how would it be revenge porn if it wasn't him? If it wasn't him, why didn't he just say "that moaning audio was not me, that account was not me, etc."
People could sue dream for grooming with his track record he could be in jail for a long while
It's nothing but a bunch of trolls milking the situation
damn I could care less.. gl
The cat is so fluffy
This is crazy, Dream doing something like this is so unexpected tbh, it just shows you, you never know who people are nowdays
I don't think Dream commited any crime or big thing that he's accused of. He said offensive slurs as a teenager that he already apologized for, but his biggest mistake is promoting the parasocial relationship and not raising any boundaries with his fans, that includes the thirst traps and he really likes recieving attention, but the fact that he seeks it from kids is very problematic.   He's not a criminal, but he's not a good person either, so people really enjoy making hurtful accusations and he can't stand not getting involved and replying or apologizing for crazy shit.
Charlie— you’re so lucky you don’t know about whimper audios 😭 also happy thanksgiving
Charlie is defending and not defending dream so he can stay safe and out of the drama
I've just edged to Charley moaning
honestly I didn't care much about dream but only started caring since I got curious of what's happening bc it's everywhere on twt/x and tiktok.. I think dream is just one of those cases of when people give someone a huuugggeee platform,, and then dream "not know" how to handle the audience xP and also the fact that he is as said by charlie, a whole ass narcissist. I just don't think he's the right person to have this much platform bc of how he's handled it since the very beginning 😬😬 I hope he pulls a miranda sings- where she posts an apology video and disappears for months and makes a comeback afterwards, if he returns successfully then good for him, if he doesn't then lol ig he got what he deserves.
Gumball being a few drinks in and abuses the shit out of dream  Charlie: well lets make a video about that and reading thru the tweets  I appreciate the effort you put in man keep making amazing content
I AM IN "I'M HERE JUST TO WATCH IO" GANG xD
Now we have video of Charlie moaning, *quick! make up some allegations.*
Dream is a rather silly little man
its not weird if the guy did put hes hands on him before that
He really shouldn't have ever done that face reveal 💀
Couldn't happen to a better person
Dream and boogy have a lot in common.
I'll say one thing. The reason why it's so hard to follow is bc no one cares to look into what dream actually says in his twitter posts and streams. This isn't just oh dream stan trying to defend him. No like, dude legit spent 40 min denying the allegations on stream and explaining a bit as an update and saying he's gonna make a full video to show all his evidence, and people clip 9 second of half a sentence and got thousands of likes on tweets and tiktok saying that "dream admitted to it". Dream has to write a bunch of statements bc he has to correct all that misinformation that gets spread. All it does is make it harder for neutral ppl to understand the situation objectively and they tend to just go ah green man bad so must be true.
From what I know Dream recently admitted to the moaning vids being real like a day or two before this video (aka the one you're watching, to be clear) was posted, though he denied it was sent to a minor, claiming it was his adult friend
Fuck dream he needs to be in jail already dream is the next edp.
JOSH GIDDY VIDEO IMCOMING
this video is honestly pretty misinformed which is sad. dream himself has made it clear that he did send those videos to somebody so i don’t really get how that was missed by Charlie :// please do more research and dive into the topic before making a video about it
1. Calling him a narcissist is wild tbqh. He's been wildly misunderstood on twt and you would start replying to people too.  2. His fans are definitely not "all kids". Honestly i think his fanbase gets infantilised and harrassed bc it's a largely female fanbase. But a lot of those are adults. 3. You got some basic facts wrong which makes me think you read like two tweets and called it research. He wasnt filming the drunk guy.
Thanks but I don't celebrate thanksgiving
This situation is so bizarre. Once you read the allegations and the alleged proof provided against Dream, you come to realize that none of it is actually enough to even begin to make him seem guilty. However, his inability to just shut the fuck up has completely destroyed people's willingness to side with him, even if he is right in the end
🤮
talk about whats going on in ireland right now
if I saw a reportage on the news with recordings of me moaning..... 😶🫠☠️☠️☠️
dream shoulda kept taking his normal pills 💀
We were right the whole time
Why is this shit always Minecraft YouTubers? Are we going to get allegations against Mumbo Jumbo one day? Or Grian? What the fuck is happening? lol
They are both horrible people tbh but in Cantu defence i feel lioe its very clear he is going through a mental episode and instead of calming him down theu just laugh and only go silent when je starts targeting them
Wtf
None of it seems factual at all. It is definitely just someone making it up on dream.
bro is defending dream holy shit
that's crazy
you forgot to mention the fact that Dream confirmed the video is real by calling it "revenge p * rn" in his long ahh tweet ☠️☠️☠️
Dream gives me major Davi vibes, the guy from Blood on the Dancefloor whom was caught doing horrible stuff to his fans whom are often kids (Young teenagers) I'd suggest that people pay attention to whom their kids like and steer them *away* from people that look like they'd be *caught in the wrong bathroom* waiting for people much *younger* then them.  *Yuck.*
Bro failed No Nut November 💀
I don’t know how a single person on the planet can defend dream recording his friend in a manic state, whilst he’s drunk (at the age of 19)
Dream just can't help himself
that highlight is fantastic lmao
If the allegations are true it would be pretty consistent with the average Minecraft YTer
U know what’s got my head scratching? That when that Amanda girl first came out (the main person) will the allegations against Dream has later stated like a year ago that she was gonna take legal action. This had made dream lawyer up and was advised to keep quiet. However a while has passed an nothing happened like if the person have the Snapchat logs to prove that he have groomed then why not post it? Why just post pics of several convos and not just the whole shebang? Like wouldn’t that be crucial for a legal case?
Charlies moans sounded like that clip of the woman getting winded during that grape stomping news clip
i love charlies videos, but he spent 10 minutes talking about nothing lmaooo
Dream is getting into Lolcow status i think people just like fuckinh with him at this point
dream is shane dawson confirmed
This video feels like an Average day of twitter
Happy Thanksgiving, weirdo
Happy Thanksgiving from my family to yours
does he not have a PR manager??
Happy “national eat foods day”!!! Hope u have a good one mate!
I've watched all of dreams manhunts and I'm 30 I don't think all of his audience is kids there's also tons of adults that play minecraft and watch minecraft content can we wait till there's actually evidence this time instead of what the internet did to johnny depp
I doubt dream has Snapchat
never thought i’d click on a video and hear charlie moaning
bro lost to drunk gumball 💀💀
since dream reveal his face, he got into drama's, its sad to see his career got onto this 😢
Dream and Nicholas are both idiots, I’m sorry, but this whole situation is ridiculous. I know next to nothing about what’s happening because I can literally feel my brain rotting away more than it already is every time I try to look into this. All I know is anyone who uses their disability as an excuse for being an asshole is just an asshole who doesn’t deserve sympathy or an excuse. (I’m referring to both of them) As someone with ADHD and Aspergers I almost never bring up my disabilities and most people aren’t aware I even have them. This is just sad to watch two grown ass men acting like boneheads spitting out their disabilities like it’s a competition and using it like a “free pass” card.
All I know is Gumball called him the f slur and it was funny 🤷‍♂️
Everyone’s crazy these days, even I’m crazy for Charlie.
This video is kinda shit ngl. I feel like he just dipped his fingers in the surface of this whole debacle and dipped ngl I just wanna say dream himself confirmed those moaning videos to be real
If dream kills himself, will anyone be suprised at this point? It wold be horible and realy sad, but it is not that unlikely at this point.
unfortunately i have received black videos of men moaning before
I think we need to give that Uber driver the recognition he needs
I met Dream in a Pot Shop in Bremerton Washington. He was mad I spotted him IRL and didn’t like the attention.  He made sure to tell me not to say what town we were in.
Best thing he can do is pull a mick gordon
The best thing about this video was Charlie's cute innocent brain thinking dudes don't send moaning videos. My brother in christ so much worse sexual shit is happening on a minute to minute basis lmfao.
Do a vid on Josh Giddy
Dream said the Moans were him in his "last" tweet and called it suedo revenge porn. i use those bc he just be wafflin on twitter when he shouldnt be
Loved the cat and dog at the start
Charlie's moan is now my ringtone
Happy thanksgiving ❤️
you should check the casetify vs dbrand & jerryrigeverything situation
Unfortunately I’ve had those videos sent to me UNSOLICITED. Men do be wildin
i need that kidney gasm proof XDXDXDXD
on a side note completely unrelated, very cute kitty and doggo
I am truthfully surprised Dream is even relevant these days, after all the cheating scandals I don't know why he continued to have any sort of online presence.  Then he revealed his face, and I am sorry but the dude looks like a pedo.
I will never get tired of Charlie monologuing (talking to us) enthusiastically along with his hand gestures like an excited golden retriever. 😂❤ Much love man. ❤
1. Thanksgiving is in October 2. Thanksgiving is not celebrated in Europe
Chease with bacon or bacon with chease
I got someone suspended from Twitter for doing this Honestly I'm happy the way Elon Musk has helped with Twitter even tho most things aren't fixed, back when the original owners owned Twitter this would've never been fixed.
it's just young people being drunk, everyone needs to relax a bit
Charlie my man, I have not personally sent a moaning video but there was a kid I went to highschool with that sent voice recordings of him moaning on the phone to a girl which was screen recorded and leaked in our school’s rugby team group chat haha
i just wanna ask why the hell they were in an uber together lmao
I've never watched Dream or anything, but these kinds of stuff are too common in other youtubers if you think about it, half the time they are fake. Possibly that's just an A.I voice generator and a bs snapchat thing, but I'm not defending Dream for what he (possibly) did
the first few seconds of this video is so wholesome!!! Jesus and his animals
Istg, after his face reveal, his career went in hell
Evidence thats "not enough" is not evidence at all
4:50 hate to break it to you but Charlie Dream LITERALLY ADMITTED to being the person in the video. He called it "revenge porn" and saying it was consensual with an adult lol......... (also we know it's a minor bc the person who it was sent to said they were I think 17 at the time)
Happy thanksgiving y’all, have a good day with family and friends
Why do all these big Minecraft YouTubers turn to miners, like I get mining is a big part of the game but let these people work smh
I work in 7th grade and the amount of Dream fanboys and girls makes me believe he truly gets a lot of kids wanting to add him.
The amount of pedos in the Minecraft community had really made people pretty one sided about them
3:44 is when this video starts
Hey, while we don’t know what’s the real story with the allegations, I think it’s REALLY fucked up to play the video, since it could be leaked revenge porn. Idk, I think playing it was a mistake regardless .
Call me coocoo for cocopuffs, neither are in the right, but i’d rather be friends with an anti-semite than a pedophile 🤷‍♂️
Sounds like a nightmare.
stuff like this makes me feel so detached, i could not care less about any of this nor do i understand it
Im 30 seconds in and I gotta say, even though Charlie's covering this, I really couldn't give a shit about it and for that, I'm going to pass up on this cesspool boss. Excited for the DnD stuff and the music btw, you rock!
Dream Palestine supporter
dream is a stale bread of a creator no personality no fun all his content is his friends being funnier than him. He doesnt have the maturity to handle his fanbase size his ego is too much, 😊if he kept his mouth shut and used twitter like most people to update when he streams 85% of his allegations wouldnt happen. Im just so tired of this man still being so popular lol
Happy Thanksgiving Charlie, Ayo, Tiana and everyone here ❤❤
Thank you for the wonderful Birthday present of a brand new goofy vid
those videos did NOT need to be replayed here, SO CURSED-
Oh yeah well I saw dream vomit caustic sludge into the face of a homeless baby
You didn’t have to play the sounds 😭
not the dream whimpering audio
He’s a sicko
Deeply misinformed and poorly researched video do better next time   Also Nat isn't Burner 22 lmao  ALSO also the moaning vids are real confirmed by dream himself
Dream is apart of the lgbtqiaah++
PSA: Dream wasn’t actually the one filming the video. You can see his hand/arm in the frame. Plus nick asked to be filmed, either so that his friends wouldn’t be incriminated in a police report or because it would make a “good YouTube video.” Not to defend dream too much but that shit’s important.
charlie not believing that men send unsolicited videos of them moaninig is quite hilarious to me. charlie..... i got some news for you.
ngl the main reason i came to watch this was bc of the gumball va and dream situation.  and ok sure there are other places to get the info... but isnt that ur job?
I'm not really a fan of Dream, but I'm glad at least someone will look at all this "evidence" with some kind of skepticism instead of blind belief.
6:10 Patreon is commonplace for that and the hub/r34
bro 3 ads in the first 5 mins of the video
you look weird in this one
Just being a Minecraft YouTuber is all I need to be wary of Dream. I've watched enough j aubrey to know that game being the main focus of your channel is basically an automatic red flag now.
that moaning snap sounded like it looped a few of the same noises... like somebody edited together some weird noises he made in a video or something and set them to a black screen and snapped it to themself
I would say so many men send videos of there pps and moaning so it's not surprising  Also I don't see many people pointing it out so I will. His dream character looks like cry and he is a pedo
Bruh if someone has maniac episodes he is sick bastard
I was having shit day but moist comes and saves the day
Dropping footage of someone drunk, high, AND having a manic episode as “proof” of how “evil” THEY are… Ironically quite evil in itself  Edit: People out here really putting Dream and Cantu down as “equally bad”, y’all probably forgot about the time when dream stayed silent about the fact that his fans were shipping minors with adults in his smp, despite the fact that these minors (also his FRIENDS btw) literally confronted dream about how uncomfortable they were about it and he essentially responded with “I can’t control my fans so there’s no point in trying, womp womp to you 😊”
Listen. I ain't one of the biggest fans of dream. Ive been kinda neutral about him since idrc but you gotta feel bad for the man. Like God this is intense. This is why Twitter or "X" or whatever you wanna call is an ass platform
It's beautiful how everyone's going against dream
3 Paths vs Team 7 1 Path vs team guy  2 Paths vs Five Kage

You and Pyro have the same title G
Idk bro Im very Drunk rn
He literally confirmed himself that the videos were sent by him. Why are charlie and the comments section all still cockriding the green groomer.
Never knew dream was apart of the lgbt
Hearing charlie moaning at 6:19 was life changing
Ik we're supposed to focus on the main plot of this video but omg Charlie ur hair is atrocious
yaaa dream is a pedo
Dream allegations list is longer than Santa naughty list
If you think Dream recording his drunk friend is worse than that drunk friend behaviour towards the Uber driver, you are on a level of stupid unheard of until today.
Why is it so common for these alleged videos of proof for scenarios like this shot in 240p.
Catto and doggo sightings in the beginning 🥺🥺🥺 how wholesome
At this point no matter what Dream does, true or not, will be received negatively. Nobody wins.
this video is the reason i know its thanksgiving because i had no idea
guys, we got charlie moaning in 1080p
Dream's biggest sin is being cringe. I think he's weird and makes me feel levels of blegh. But this seems like a case of hate watchers trying to destroy him.
Watching this while taking a massive shit 👍
0:44 - 1:53 : The life of Thee Agent.
Oh my god. There ain’t nothing to watch except people I never liked being cancelled and YouTube recommending 3-7 year old videos I’ve already seen. I don’t understand what is even going on w this dream guy even tho I’ve reluctantly started to watch at least 2 videos on it
Dream didn’t just shoot himself in the foot when it comes to the court of public opinion he sawed off both legs as on his alt he confirms he did send those videos  but there’s no clear evidence it was to a minor he just said it was an unstable ex
the Face reveal was the beginning of the end
The leaked whimpering audios were wild
Nick Cantu isn't even 21 as I write this. The fact that Dream got cross faded with a minor and filmed him for blackmail is skeezy beyond skeezy
The thing is recently with Gumballs VA HE WAS UNDERAGE DRUNK WHICH IS WRONG ON SO MANY LEVELS !!
you skipped the best part of the video when nicolas cantu calls dream a f*ggot  "right but because you said 'that's what the mask is!' i think you're a f*ggot alright"
i don’t give a shit about gum ball Or dream, it’s not right he called him the f slur
Is Dream really a narcissist? I don't get that from what I've seen of him, obviously anyone who goes to 10s of millions of subs overnight is gonna be a bit self-centred, but I'd think he's one of the least when compared to others in his position. But maybe there's more going on that I don't know about...
Who cares
Happy Thanksgiving Charlie!
He never should have showed his face.   The moment he showed his face I KNEW the accusations would begin.
charlie cover the josh giddey situation
I'm innocent... What's a thirst trap?
The world is actually ending there's no way gumball Watterson is beefing with dream.
Nicolas Cantu says something antisemitic, and no one bats an eye... cool.
Conspiracy Theory: This was Kwebbelkwop or whatever's master plan on AI capability
Are we gonna ignore the cat stepping in and the dog looking up at the screen?
nick cantu and charlie join forces to cook dream
Why is it always the Minecraft YouTubers, bro? 💀
6:31 someone please replace the “dream moaning” audio with this
I miss when the most serious Dream drama was just allegations about faking his manhunts
Happy gobble gobble day.
Ladies skip to 5:36
Charlie charging his Kamehameha at 5:10
Holy shit i started this video thinking it would be about speed running shenanigans again...did not see that coming!
Happy thanksgiving Charlie🫡
Hi
Never noticed he has a real grade gundam exia in the back
So uh, I know that you don't like watching the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade every single year, but did you at least watch this year's iteration?
Take that poor gundam out the damn box👿
Fix your hair.
That’s an old ass version of Snapchat. I mean there’s probably some people that still use that version. Though dream drama just makes me cringe so hard
all im doing for thanksgiving is eating bagel bites and chugging water alone in my room.
I am starting to think that Dream is rapidly evolving into a predator thanks to how much he has gotten away with  Sure, he got called out for cheating on some significant records… but then he had the last laugh by controlling most of the narrative into a “it happened but I did not and could not have known” deal  Keep a close eye on him, I’m willing to bet that if these new allegations against him yield fruit or if something worse happens in the meantime that he will pull the whole feigning ignorance trick again, but unfortunately for him, the collective memory of the Internet will not be fooled twice
I forgot I had this open and I unpaused the video at 5:37 to hear that
Happy thanksgiving!
6:00 i dunno i think we've all done some wacky shit while horny
5:10
im giving thanks to dream for providing us with so much content to watch
Ive sent audios moaning and people love it so >:( but yeah the whole situation is crazy
I think it’s either a complete fake video of someone moaning OR it is really dream but he was smart enough not to show anything that people would recognise it’s him
dream is basically a lolcow atp
I love your kitty cat whats it's name?
Charlie I love you and watch all of your videos but the entire video the top of ur hair was bugging me and I couldn’t stop looking
2:44 HELLO? What thirst traps?💀 yall be making everything up to try and cancel this man even more
Gumball vs Dream is the most insane cross-over
sorry to bother you, but can you please pass the gravy
dream actually confirmed it was real 😂 he called it “revenge porn”
unsurprising
Do a video on the Josh Giddy situation! It's crazy. NBA star is basically a pedo
This is all Ethan Klein's fault
People should be really careful before jumping into any conclusion Situations like the ProJared drama is proof on why internet justice doesnt work  mob justice is like a rabid dog. They bite you and they dont let you go until they are done mauling you
Regardless; the video of him and gumball, shows him partying with someone who is legally not allowed to be drinking. His supposed best defense, is evidence of him breaking the law in very close arena to the one he's already being accused of. No matter what, it certainly doesn't look good. His best defense is to obfuscate. That really doesn't say I didn't do it.
And at that moment pyro knew, his video would no longer get any views
The whole thing is so fucking stupid tbh
Dream watching this 😬
I would hate to be in a public place while watching this as there’s a large amount of the moans here haha
Ngl i never cared if the allegations were true or not (well obvs i care a lot more if they ARE true), its just another reason to clown on dream 💀
when i heard "gumball v dream" i certainly didnt think it was gumball watterson 🤣
His minecraft speedrunning fell off so he's speedrunning drama
I came for killer bean and I never looked back
This level of cyberbullying Dream is getting is quite worrying. I've never watched a Dream video in my life but people are being absolutely horrible to this guy, and I think it's a bit overblown.
For the past couple of Charlie's videos my eyes have been drawn to the fact the top of his face is paler than the bottom. Bro fell asleep on the beach with his snorkeling goggles on
The last time I heard about Dream everyone on the internet was praising him and now you drop this bomb LOL
960707
Dream reminds me of a young Kevin Spacey... for some reason.
Josh giddy
Happy thanksgiving everyone 🎉
Happy Thanksgiving to anyone who needs it.
Has anyone else noticed how many damn pedophiles and groomers have been spotted/accused of such things this year? There's also the YouTubers spoctor going through drama like this. It's like 2023 is pedo accusing/exposing year.
Cat and dog ❤️❤️❤️
I firmly believe Dream has a wall of text in the notes of his phone for every single type of allegation possible. Even if he did them or not.
Bro why you gotta remind me about the shane dawson stuff,
i knew it was inevitable this would happen after the face reveal everyone popular either gets accused of it or has done it eventually.
This Video did really filled me up like the Turkey today
Can we talk about how much of a huge of a douche Bag Can2 is like wow, outta all the shit that we don't have evidence about but we blindly side with the lesser of assholes. I don't hope it ruins his career or nun but like we excuse alot of obvious sign a horrible person would show.  Its giving sociopath.
The fact Charlie was later than Pyro is a treat blessed every year.
at this point we should just label all minecraft youtubers as pdf files because of the amount of them
It should be mentioned that Dream apparently recorded that video at Nick's request.
Wait wtf happened
Charlies content sucks im way better😂😂😂.
Dream groomed me
After hearing Charlies jump scare, I dont know if i will ever be horny again.
props for being level headed about it charlie
Dream face reveal was the biggest mistake of his minceraft career
why are there so many youtubers these days who get so many attention. for no reason. who cares?
It's exactly like one of that comment about Dream. He never fails to sound like he's a ped*.
I fucking hate thanksgiving
Groomer or not, he still sucks lol
YEAHHHHHH WOOOO HE ADDRESSED THE DREAM SITUATION IM SO HAPPY LMAO
The only news source I get “internet” drama from
Dream already said it was his moaning video
EDIT: It was him, he actually recorded that audio lmao why would a big YouTuber just do that, at least put it behind an Onlyfans or some kind of paywall.  As much as I don't like Dream, that voice sounds nothing like him. People are muddying the waters with allegations that have little to no evidence which is making it extremely difficult to actually tell what's going on, and Dream's own behavior does not help matters at all.
I'm simple man, I see a cat I hit the like button
Dream’s biggest mistake in life was showing his face
i had the video going in the background, was half listening, and started hearing moaning. definitely something that i did not want to hear today 😭
Regardless of whether dream is guilty or not. He is absolutely guilty of making horrible music
That’s a fucked up looking dog and cat
What's twitter?
I might be spreading complete misinformation here, but I do remember hearing dreams friends complain about how he would send them videos of him moaning
5:10 best part
the internet has been waiting to sht on dream for a while. kinda unsurprised people sided against him
i really dont think Dream could pull this shit, and im pretty sure im older than him...  that does NOT sound like it could even remotely be him.
who is dream
Bro you have GOT to flip that middle part of hair the other direction it's passing me off 😂
Also more information that are facts,not speculation- Dream did not host the party where Cantu got intoxicated in, it was a woman named Adrianah Lee, and based on Texas law it was her responsibility to keep Cantu from drinking (although Cantu has stated he had a fake ID). Dream did not know who he was and only knew he was at the party because he hit him. Dream admitted to hitting him back before leaving the party in an Uber (that he bought), where Cantu decided to join the passenger seat. Dream did not record the video, a friend of Cantus did because he thought “it would make a funny YouTube video” and Cantu asked everyone to record him, further proved by the end of the video where Cantu asks them to cut. This is where many think “he kept the video to use it when he could.” According to Dream he had let it go, especially since Cantu apologized, but when Cantu brought it up again and wouldn’t stop he had to ask one of the people who recorded to send him the video. The person was hesitant but agreed if they remained anonymous. Regardless of everything that happened Dream ensured that Cantu got home safe and payed for the Uber, which is confirmed by a message send to the Uber. These are facts that I wanted to share, and albeit Cantu was jntoxicated it was not Dreams fault. So form whatever opinion you want from that.
I gave up drama completely when the Dream drama started because I could NEVER figure out what was going on. Who is Dream? Why do people hate him? Should we hate him, or hate his detractors? Every video I watch to break it down just confuses me even more. Like your thumbnail might as well be written in ancient cuneiform, that's how much sense it makes.  And for that reason, I'm out.
I don't know what a thanksgiving is.
Critical just dropping free OF content with those moans wtf
How is anyone surprised
So who is bad guy the ppl or dream I'm kinda confused here
Charlie moan video before GTA 6
Dream is definitely the new Shane Dawson ngl
Dude I cringed so hard at the moaning part.
Dream Scenario was actually about this Dream
For anyone Dream'n, it's time to wake up to Reality
oh your cat is so cute wtf
Thanks Charlie, starting my Thanksgiving off with a video of a man moaning.
Dream moaning is my new ringtone 👌😏
The correlation between being and MC YouTuber and a PoS needs to be studied
When is the FBI gonna hire Detective Charlie?
9 likes on a 2 hour post is pretty insane for this channel. Just wanted to point that out lmao.
Bro got the fastest speedrun for the sex offender
People: That’s a nice argument there why don’t u back it up with a source   Twitter users: My source is I made it the fuck up
I remember when the Marcus Wilton situation was still unfolding seven years ago. One of the points that really nailed him was made in the original ColossalIsCrazy video about it, where he said _"even if he's telling the truth about everything, he does not deserve to keep his audience of vulnerable children."_ What ever happened to making fucking sense like that?
Dream is trying to not get cancelled i guess. Better to just not give em any air tho. Just literally ignore it
I think a huge issue for Dream is his audience, personality, content, and life has revolved around a 13 year old mindset that he cant escape it.
So the pokimane "drama" was "horrible", but this story which includes blatant racism is only "crazy" or "wild"? Clown shoes.
6:19 Thank you Charlie for ruining my no nut november
Can't be Shane Dawson, I don't hear any cats screaming.
What about Josh Giddey?
It sounds spliced together.
Happy thanksgiving to you too, Charlie!
Charlie has great pets
He stops his yappin at 3:51 👍🏼
They're both assholes, but Dream is definitely coming off as worse.
This sounds like a nightmare
Dreams downfall is something out of a movie
no literally
6:19 Charlie turning into Jolly Roger from Banjo-Tooie
I’ve gotten videos of dudes moaning on Discord.
I'm in Italy, we don't celebrate Thanksgivings Day but the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary on 8th December.
I think we need a dedicated Io video tbh.
They’re both horrible people. Simple as that
Tbh if he hadn't rigged the mob vote for the glow squid, none of this would be happening.
When charlie moaned i shid and came
I hereby would like to request of Charlie moaning is used for part 3 of Charlie as Freddy Fazbear.
People are gonna clip Charlie's "moans" from this video and use them to accuse him of chatting up their family dog.
We won, btass and their fans next
POV penguin0 cooming:   6:20
It never ceases to amaze me how Charlie will unabashedly put out easily clippable moments for meme fodder for free.
Imagine if dream never showed his face and retired like a normal person none of this shit would've ever happened 😅
I wish people would stop throwing around the word “narcissist”, acting as if you know enough about a celebrity or influencer to diagnose them with such serious terms is just as parasocial as stans.  It’s also odd people seem so eager to throw around the words pedo/groomer for jokes and hit tweets instead of expressing sympathy towards the potential victims.  Overall people are way too picky about dreams behavior, most people that describe his “cringe, weird” traits are just describing neurodivergent tendencies and actions, saying “thirst trapping” is suspicious behavior?! When the only thing in his tiktoks/posts are his face? Cmon now.   If you don’t like him fine but there is no legally damning proof against him.
dream confirmed the videos to be real (twice)
let get on the same page. we all got bricked up when charlie moaned.
Penguinz0 out of context 6:19
The fact that Dream has evidence against Nicolas Cantu but people still take the side of Nic just goes to show what kind of person Dream is.
I always pictured a cute chick, walk up to a handsome chap, listening to music in a public spot. She removes one of his earbuds, moves it to her ear and asks what he’s listening to. Before he can answer, she hears the sounds of moaning 😂
CAT
My ex who was a girl had a fetish with moaning videos and she sent them to me a lot and i would do it but make it stupid I would do stuff like ohhh my god shrek ohhh optimus prime ohhh she hated me for it thank god
At what point does neglect become malice? At what point do you see your fans DOXing, harassing, sending death threats, etc, before it becomes your responsibility for not saying anything? Dream's community is probably the most toxic group online, and what has he done to help deal with this problem? Nobody's responsible for their audience, but there comes a point where refusing to address it is just morally wrong.
Dream prob making the fake accounts
I’m not defending dream, but that video can so easily be be faked and I think it it clearly was, if that person wanted to prove it was dream they would of clicked the username to prove it, I find dream to be a weirdo but I’m sick of people treating false allegations like they’re real, that’s unfair to anyone especially considering how easy these claims could of been faked, and given how hated dream is, it’s not far fetched to say that Snapchat video is faked. Again I down care about dream as much but it’s the general concept of false allegations ruining peoples lives
What's crazier is that Dream admitted to the audio
Also more lore- back in 2020-2021 someone contacted the fbi telling them that Dream had kids in his basement, and he was swatted because of this. He has direct contact with the fbi as well. Ik this seems random but if someone is accused of kidnapping children they go through the persons online footprint and phone, so it’s highly unlikely that any of this proof could be substantial enough to convict him if anything. Also he has stated that he is dropping a video with his proof, and I suggest everyone to take this seriously and not be biased for once, despite their hate for this man. It’s ok to hate someone but it’s not ok to spread allegations as fact, doxx someone when others live there, and spread what is alleged to be a man having e-s*x with a child or revenge p*rn. Hearing both sides before forming an opinion I s a good habit to have.
"Trust but verify" -raymond reddington
im on a not guilty until proven but them moans legit dont sound like dreams voice just sounds like an American dude legit common american voice there no proof thats dream
When you hide behind a mask, stay that way. If you fuck up, no one know what you look like. Disappear if you want to.
I don’t doubt that dream has indeed talked with minors in a bad manner, but the “evidence” was weak. He’s still a complete dipshit though
I honestly have no idea if dreams guilty for any of the illegal stuff but he's still just extremely unlikable. What really annoys me though is how people will just mindlessly believe the accusations without definitive proof and immediately took gumballs side even though he should be held accountable in some way for his actions, even if he was high, drunk or manic.
Happy Thanksgiving Charlie
I lowkey wanna see Charlie make a video about Micheal Jackson
There are some real idiots out there on the internet. The fact that people strongly believe something without any credible proof. If this is actually fake y’all are some horrible people and going this far to bring down a man just because they hate him is an example of why some people need to just touch some grass. I’ve seen people take clips of him addressing the allegations and cutting out the important context to make him sound bad and now I’m seeing a Snapchat dream moaning when it sounds like a teen doing it. No sympathy for anyone actively spreading further allegations and no respect for the semi relevant twitter accounts getting involved just to get more interactions
This is a nightmare  A nightmare
You've talked about the size of your weiner, you've posted "hot" videos of you. My guy, you have kids in your audience. Is that creepy? No. You can not just select what you want your audience to be. And ofc the thirst traps are jokes, intended CLEARLY for adults, it is not our fault that kids also know about that at a young age, you can blame their parents for that.
I need to clip Charlie's moan and send it to all my friends on Christmas
So to our forfathers
hmmm, i wonder if the guy who called himself ''dream'' is a narcissistic nonce. wait no he cant be, he plays minecraft and has a neckbeard
One of my previous girlfriends was perpetually horny she always wanted to sext and whenever videos would come into play she would request that i moan in them.. i was very uncomfortable with it but i did it cause she liked it. Dont think I'd ever do it again tho shit is super cringe to think back on lol
classic moist W.
Nice little kitty
Nice hair Charlie. 💀👌
Can we take a moment to appreciate Charlie’s full, luscious and perfectly symmetrical eyebrows?
People just need to leave dream alone and let him fuck up himself 🗿
Charlie moaning at 6:19 sounds like a young Arnold Schwarzenegger 😂
I don't care for Dream, never watched him... But he is pretty hard to avoid & the story of his downfall is actually sad, despite me not liking the guy.... I think anyone would agree that having everyone go from a huge supporter, to despising you can't be easy on a mental level, which is probably why ever since his face reveal he has been acting so awkward, strange & causing everyone to dislike him more and more... Not on his side, Im just saying that the metal battle he is probably going through is causing a lot of the actions he is taking & it just makes me feel bad for the guy
hope he’s learned his lesson. maybe next time he wont give us a glow squid.
A MINECRAFT YOUTUBER BEING A CREEP?!?!?!???? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!     There have been only 3 clean ones   Stampy Popularmmos  Captain sparkles  Stampy
Happy thanksgiving
This seems like a complicated conflict. How about you don't talk about it and ignore it like the gaza issue
i really do not give a damn about this situation but i love  charlies videos sooo
If edp445 can send a pic of his shit to pick up minors I can believe dream would send a vid of him moaning
Honestly this situation with Dream is a mess. He has been into way too many controversies and I doubt he will last any longer. His toxic fanbase and using that fanbase as an army is not good, and I think Dream leaving Twitter and the internet for good may be a possibility. Despite Dream’s attempts to remove the toxicity from his fanbase, it’s still prevalent unfortunately.
my mans eyebrows looking magical
6:19..Dont ever do that again! 🤣
Coming from a trans person me and half of the lgbtq community side with gumball waterson
been following the drama for a long time, honestly sick that charlie finally got on it
I have no idea who this dream person is, and he is probably a fruit for having a name like “Dream”
Is that a video response I see in the description box? Can't wait for all the OF girls to learn about that feature so YT can remove it again.
Let's just say that 2023 is the year of celebrity being a registered offender or assaulter, cuz like it's not even surprising anymore that the word hasn't not been used like in every month this year already
it took all of two seconds to see that he's a creep
Dream flat out admitted that he sent those videos, and tried playing it off as someone who was “above age”… and the person he accused of screen recording came forward even saying that they never did…. He is constantly back tracking, and contradicting himself…. I really don’t think he’s innocent
I’m 100% better then Charlie
6:20 Charlie sounding like a DS1 character
I’m 100% better then Charlie
From what i've seen, Dream's kind of a jerk, but if he's not guilty, he's not guilty. Is he a P-file? If evidence shows up, i'll believe it.   To his haters/accusers: You realize he gets more attention out of this, right?
I’m 100% better then Charlie
lol
Charlie, stop glorifying the witch hunt of "pedophiles" in all your videos. Asking people indirectly to never ever forgive anyone who has ever spoken to children in a non medically professional way and saying how weird it is to talk to children is only reinforcing the false notion that everyone is a pedo and they must all be prosecuted as one.
I’m 100% better then Charlie
THE CAT AND DOG ARE ADORABLE
I knew that Gumball was based
I’m 100% better then Charlie
6:21 didn’t know Charlie was fluent in danish
I’m 100% better then Charlie
I’m 100% better then Charlie
I’m 100% better then Charlie
ye nah, dream described the moaning video as "revenge porn", def him
I’m 100% better then Charlie
Everything Dream says makes me imagine him looking like a blue haired fat teenage girl. The guy is such a snowflake and acts like a child in any situation that isn’t completely in his favor. What a loser.
Someone plz send me the link of that meme Charlie was talking about with the dude screaming while passing a kidney stone 😂😂😂
Boy said brows done 💅🏻💅🏻
I love not having social media accounts because I get to see twitter like a man sees gorillas in a zoo, it seems so primal and primitive. But sometimes I get hit with wild shit like this and it's like the monkeys that figured out prostitution after being explained the concept of money. Not pretty, but a worthy case study.
Moral of the story? If you have a successful career without your face being publicly known? Keep it that way.  Remain the mysterious stranger.
Wow
I can't wait for people to abuse the moaning clips in this video. Another one for the "Out of Context Charlie" clip bucket.
I hate dream but gumball's va saying he's like Einstein is so fucking cringe to me.
Dream confirmed the moans were real
God, the mental gymnastics these people do just to gaslight and abuse people are disgusting. I don't even like Dream, but he seriously needs to get away from everyone he's around. From the video alone, everyone can tell those people all hate him, they ain't his friends or his actual fans. They don't care if anyone mistreats him verbally or physically, they are so entitled that they believe he should just accept that as his life because that's what they want for him. I couldn't imagine getting told I'm lesser than someone else and will always be lesser in every aspect. Because they have so many things they're going to be doing in life. Even though they also call me slurs, somehow the person doing this to me is now considered the victim. Even though everyone would call me a liar if I tried to talk about these issues without having them recorded, I'm now the bad guy because I tried to stick up for myself and call out the degenerate way someone treats me.
Thsts the old snapchat design so the video isnt recent unless someone decided not to update for years
Im currently stuffing my face with green beans
Eh. I don’t care a single bit for engaging with content creators… most of them seem to have a big ego for no reason other than people watch them. I just want them to make content. Dream makes enjoyable Minecraft Manhunt videos so whatever.
Dream i would say is not guilty just cringe
Ive seen dream in many discords he hooked up with total biscuit too i find it funny popular youtubers are always minors
There’s no proof that dream is a pedo I don’t watch the guy but I heard all the stuff and he ain’t don’t call someone a pedo without proof or your a piece of absolute crap words mean nothing it’s actions that count like EDP
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS
No matter how stupid Dream is, this shit isn’t incriminating proof but Twitter will always assume guilty until proven innocent.
Dream had such a crazy downfall
Charlie kinda does look like a caveman that for the first time saw fire
I agree with almost everything said here, but as someone who's been following the allegations for a while I do want to say that dream actually did confirm in a private tweet that the moaning video was his. He admitted to that being him, but his claim is that he sent it to someone else who wasn't a minor, which doesn't really make sense though because a minor is in possession of the video. Like you said, it's nothing definitive, but I really think it's an important piece of context.
I enjoy watching you while I eat my thanksgiving dinner alone. almost feels like the family drama I'm missing out on
Dream holding onto that footage of Gumball saying slurs and yet held onto it till it benefited him is super scummy and sketchy.
long awaited,, ive been wondering wtf was happening
Random but Dream posted me on his Tik Tok recently calling me Charlie. lmao
Happy Thanksgiving, Charlie!
I mean its not like Minecraft youtubers/stremers have a history of pedophilia.... ohhh wait.
OMFG IM BEEN WAITING FOR U TO TALK ABOUT THIS
When has he ever posted a thirst trap?! Selfied yes, but I don't think you know what a thirst trap picture is if you think he's posting them. Also his demographic is not mostly kids, that's a misconception about alot of minecrafters
I like to think Charlie has been waiting for this moment for so long to roast and talk about dream
Damn, I was hoping this was just more of his silly music videos lol. Never watched him, but you hate to see it happen.
Thats going on the soundboard 😂 6:22
Last time I heard about this guy was when he was accused of cheating in Minecraft? lol
the perfect gift for thanksgiving, thank you Charles!
Charlie’s cat made the opening seconds a masterpiece
The only real option is for Charlie to get dream to moan and compare the audio 😂
This situation is so crazy.. but then again, dream is in his mid 20's. He's still in the "Do stupid shit" phase of his life. And hes in the public eye. Most celebs in and around his age are always caught in drama and doing dumb stuff. And with the backlash of his face reveal I honestly feel bad for dream. I'm not saying these accusations aren't founded and that hes been inappropriate at times.  But people need to remember its innocent until PROVEN guilty. And youtubers aren't exactly well equipped to deal with the pressure that comes with an online persona/fame. Most of the time people react in the only way they know how and I can't fault dream for doing that even if it does make him look guilty as fuck. Like, I'm playing devils advocate here but people need to look at situations constructively without joining the bandwagon of hating somebody without really knowing why or without any actual evidence.
Ah yes 13 to 16 yr olds are children
For this Thanksgiving I've been watching Cooking with Jack, just to remember & be grateful that nobody cooks like that.
man recorded himself getting flamed. Youtuber moment
I'm not saying Dream is innocent at all, but it's super telling all the Twitter guys that hate him immediately believing any allegations against him while when someone famous they like get allegations against them it's "innocent till proven guilty." It's never about the victims just protecting people they like and attacking who they don't
3:59 My day is ruined 💀
Honestly, wouldn't be surprised if the voice was AI generated tbh
It’s your typical Twitter sensationalist BS too. I think a lot of the gremlins there just want engagements, not necessarily truth. You hear of supposed drama every other day at this point. I’m not sure how people aren’t desensitised by now. I never got into dream so idc either way.
Charlie: "I don't think anyone's ever been so terminally horny-" EDP: Allow me to introduce myself
Why whould you moan a minor whould not even understand that as sexual intent makes no sense
He really need to touch grass or unninstalling social media, or he just do these dramas for content/to make him keep/always popular or in topics.
Damn so you can be antisemitic on camera and people will side with you. Fuck the internet
Aye I don't care about Dream, fuck him for milking Technoblade death.
dude is a werido. i believe some of it and also believe people who hate him are making some of it up.
Let’s not forget Dream’s biggest crime: Making the glow squid win and not the Iceologer or Moobloom
Can we get a video of your fur babies 🥺
6:18 cant wait for this to be used in memes
The guy’s ego is fucking massive
Dream confirmed audio was him a day or two ago.
Maybe one day they can catch him like edp445, would be sooo funny
Dream definitely ain’t living a dream right now, that’s for sure
You know it's bad when a video of your enemy saying slurs and shit is circulating everywhere, and the internet still takes their side instead of yours.
Dream did call the moaning thing, "revenge porn", implying it was him and the only reason it got released is to spite him.
I think dream's manhunt videos are all pretty entertaining, but jeez is everything else he does just a nightmare
Its just a troll
Pyrocynical beat you to it. Get better
I think a garuanteed safe option is to make Dream the bad guy
That audio clip could literally come from any male asmr on Youtube or the  Hub.  Edit: I WAS WRONG! I watched Oompa’s video and Dream confirmed that it was his audio. He claims that the audio was used to back him look bad as he filmed that with a voice actor. Idk all the details but that moaning was him.
Dream: gets cancelled Gumball: *Homelander Alright*
This man turned a joke into a series with hope, despair, loss and hype. He deserves every bit of recognition he has and even beyond that
Honestly i cant think of anything possible dream could have done that would be worse than $7 cookies
Don't know why, long time follower but he's getting on my nerves recently.
Happy thanksgiving thank you for the video
Wild how a simple face reveal just basically ruined this guys reputation 😂
Happy Thanksgiving Charlie and co
imagine actually being mad at gumball crazy LOL
Everyone ik is happy dream got his ass beat by gumball
Chronic online user here, tagged you in a tweet with the proof that dream outted himself and the chat log or w/e there is a nude minor in the video and that's why the whole thing is not allowed to be shown, please hope charlie sees this idk man
I don't like dream because he is a cheater. Beyond a reasonable doubt.
Bro got jumped by Gumball. 😭
all i want is to all these allegations turn out true so dream finally gets off internet so i dont have to hear about this pathetic looser anymore
I keep wishing Dream would just learn how to let things go. Idk delete twitter or something. I think he would be happier and less hated.
Dream is what we british call a raging nonce
Bro dream is so trash
Dreams getting a whole police report filed on him, at least one of the allegations is true
dream just cant stop taking these L's 💀💀💀
Fill you up princess is CRAZY💀💀
Idk dream got bodied ig
That is Dream wimpering😭 He said it himself in one of his Twitter rants
One thing I’ve always respected about Charlie is his stance of innocence until proven guilty. He needs irrefutable evidence before he can come to a verdict on a situation.
... who the fuq is " Dream" ?
dream admitted it was him tho he called it revenge porn😭😭😭 but he’s claiming that he sent it to a consenting adult
My issue with this whole situation is that Dream is TERRIBLE at explaining things and defending himself. There was a clip going around before the Gumball situation that was out of context and the stans were like, "watch the context clip". The "clip" is 42 mins of him saying the same thing and claiming he has receipts, but never showing it. Then the Gumball beef happened where he pulled up receipts real fucking quick. Dream accuses him of assault, being an asshole to the Uber driver, and saying slurs like the f-slur and the N-WORD. Gumball admits to being a drunk asshole and everything, except the racist stuff. Dream posts dm's of his apology (no date btw), and saying Gumball is still lying and is racist. Dream blocks Gumball. Nicolas Cantu is supposedly neurodivergent and pansexual btw, so how you feel about someone saying slurs they are allowed to say is up to you. Dream then posts the video continuing that Gumball is still lying, but also drops the racism allegation. Dream also claims he has held onto this video for 2 months. If this was a genuine problem, why is he posting this stuff in response to someone else like blackmail, and not as a "hey this guy is an asshole". On top of that, he's running this narrative that Gumball is still lying despite admitting to everything that Dream keeps showing is real. What is the argument here? You're going to get people that hate your guts, but why are you still posting this shit and claiming that someone is still lying that you already blocked before they could respond back? Why are you also making shit up (like Gumball saying the n-word) when you have truth in front of you too!? Like how do you say "I actually paid the Uber Driver" then post text messages that look fake AF? It's so weird how obsessive he is about this, while the pedo allegations keep growing, and he's supposed to be making his response video with all of his receipts. For the new stuff he proceeds to call the moaning videos as "revenge porn", and confirms it on both his private and public accounts. So we can confirm the audio is real.
To me it seems like you’re faking being confused, just to stretch the video to 10 minutes
Oh god split your hair from somewhere else. This looks horrible!
Okay, I know Dream isn’t popular, but are we really rallying around the guy who started spouting slurs?? Y’all are wild, if someone started calling me slurs, drunk or not, I’d record that shit too
My thanksgiving dinner was wonderful, Charlie. Thanks for the best wishes.
I like Charlie like to look into the degeneracy on the interweb , and it’s more fun because I just don’t care about any of the characters in this anime word!  Best kinda drama any I don’t care about any side.
Dream asked the moaning is him, but she wasn't underage
Such a glorious gato
Dude is an egomaniac if he used the same name as one of the biggest R&B artists out there. He could have picked a name that isn't already taken. I never heard of this guy before
New meme has been made
Charlie’s kitty smacking the mike with her tail is so cute🥹  The Gumball memes are pretty funny, and the fact his VA was mocking him in the car singing the Mask song made me laugh harder than it should have.   On a serious note, part of me feels a bit bad for Dream because people are calling him a nonce when there’s no real definitive proof and almost every allegation people have made against him usually has literally no real evidence to back it up. People need to stop taking everything at face value and abide by “Innocent Until Proven Guilty.” Even if I don’t like someone, no one deserves to have their life ruined by false allegations.  On the other hand Dream also sorta brought some of this on himself with how he enabled his core fanbase, calling them kittens, pandering and apologizing at any instance when people got mad at him over petty stuff, and he gets into arguments with random people on twitter making random baseless accusations and is making an ass of himself responding to nobodies who clearly just want clout and followers. He even allegedly threatened to sue the Dream parody account. He needs to stop interacting with every person that shits on him on Twitter and hopefully he can properly defend himself in his video.  If he IS proven guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt he better face some justice, but we’ll see how he responds in his video addressing all the big allegations
I didn’t have a good time, lions lost😔
Dream became Nightmare
Why wouldn't we expect that from a minecraft youtuber?
Dream needs to leave the internet and live in the woods I pray for the wildlife
As someone who thinks that Dream is honestly kinda an asshole and never watched his content, I think we should wait until the response. I'm also a Kwite fan and the allegations against him came up when I used to watch him religiously. I've been burned badly by this kinda thing before and I would hate for false allegations to kill someone's revenue, no matter who they are
Dream doing this to himself by writing paragraph after paragraph whenever anyone opens their mouth about him. Actually braindead Ive never seen anyone else go about dealing with a situation the way dream has, would be better off if he just stopped writing essays no one is gonna read/make people get on his ass even more
Dream didnt deny the moaning videos. He called them revenge porn of him so he pretty much confirmed it
If I was Dream in this situation (and I didn't do anything wrong obviously) I would probably delete all my social media (Exept YouTube ofc) so that I could rest in peace. (PS. I only watch Dream for the content, if he has allegedly done anything I do not condone any of that behaviour)
Wow Charlie's cat got so fluffy
The amount of immaturity from people on x sending, liking and sharing blindly false evidence or hardly believed one just to lock dream up is insane and sad tbh. I don't want to be in a bad situation by defending an actual groomer but in the same time the hate i feel from every thread on x is making me reconsider if dream was actually a victim not a criminal. I feel like we need some goverment force to handle the situation cuz it's just gone so far and dangerous for the parties in the situation. we need an actual investigation to put an end for these ongoing allegations or else worse days are coming.
There is TONS of people supporting Nick who are LGBT and plus Nick is Pans so him using the f word is ok. Dreams a pe do so Nick destroying Dream is very satisfying
Tik toks gonna go wild with this
It’s almost like Dream continuing to play Minecraft with an audience stagnant in their teens and tweens as he ages is uh, not good.
Dream's entire internet presence is honestly just a huge lesson to other current and inspiring creators, the main message of many being 'Shut Up'. Honestly, 90% of drama for creators like him is completely avoidable if he simply... ignores it, especially if the allegations are false. Dream is like that one kid who has to punch, scream and fight back if they get teased even the slightest bit. You have to realise at some point that all they are searching for is a reaction and the best way to deal with it is to ignore them. :facepalm:
As someone who's unfortunately tried internet dating I can confirm that yes dudes do send those kind of cringe videos 😂
America has a severe mental health problem
He actually confirmed the snapchat video was real.
Io had to chime in about her fellow cat brethren, Gumball in the beginning
“I believe dream is a narcissist“ I instantly liked the video
This situation is crazy
It’s one thing if your girlfriend asks you to send a moaning video but randomly sending them unwarranted is weird as hell lmaoo
happy thanksgiving, or as we in canada call it "thursday"
it was over the minute he dropped the face reveal
Dream himself basically confirmed the moaning audio was him by getting pissed at ‘revenge porn’ of him was getting shared
Nah we don't watch football on Thanksgiving we watch the moist man😂
Dream is just minecraft zoomer Onision
I always thought he had an out when there was a fake dream account that was evidence for the allegations but now its such a mess I gave up figuring things out. Especially when his defenses are mediocre.
Not to defend dream, because if even one of those things are true they're a creeper through and through, but if a famous person assaulted me and acted like how they did with an Uber Driver I'd keep that recording as well. Maybe I'm an awful person, but in a world where when it comes to one person's voice vs another's it helps to have a video of it.
two minutes in and it sound like an epispde of The News Hasn't Happened Yet @.@
arguable the best video cause it starts with a kitty
Omg we havent seen Io in ages ❤
i hadn’t heard the audio before this and i was hoping i’d never have to 😔
I've been hoping for an Io cameo. Love to see the ol' boy in good health.
a point i’ve seen brought up is that, in the clip of the three in the car the driver is shown to have an iphone, yet the text messages between Dream and the driver are green
As much as i dislike dream, this is a good example how people run with misinformation when it suits their opinions. In an age where sctual videos of real people doing pretty much anything can be ai generated a voice that sounds similar and an account which has the same name means absolutely nothing.
It's not that crazy dream has a lot of wierd beta energy and people like shitting on him
It's funny how it took a talking blue cartoon cat to destroy Dream's reputation. Even though Dream's opponent, Cantu, did some absolutely wild stuff, it's still worse to be Dream in this situation. I don't think anyone would be suprised if he was outed as a groomer.
Only thing Ik about dream is that he took off his mask and that’s all I know 😅
The fact that somebody commits a literal crime and everybody still takes their side is the most internet thing ever
My mom literally turned on a bluetooth speaker outside and my audio connected as Charlie started to moan 😂😂😂😂
If only he didn’t throw away his normal pills
Hair is looking extraordinary luscious today
I’ve been WAITING for this vid since I found out
Guys, dont worry, dream is having a shortage of normal pills...
Should we also ban women wearing bikinis at the beach, women wearing wat they like in public, or ads tv movies etc with "thirst traps"? Idk this guy but I j feel like somebody hates him real bad
6:19 that was some great filthyfrank impression mr. penguinz0
im thankful for charlies daily uploads 🙏
I think cantu and dream are both POS.
The issue with twitter is many of the people using it believe “guilty until proven innocent” when it’s actually the direct opposite.
Exactly, I thought the first thing was sus because you can’t prove it’s him. I don’t like Dream but don’t make up things lol.
Part of me hopes that this situation resolves itself by Dream doing the same thing that Kwite did - posting a long-ass video that provides tons of proof that all the accusations are false - but until then, I'm not even gonna try and detangle this mess, let alone make a judgement here.
6:00 there my friend, you are wrong, sadly
For all the people saying that dream is filming him, you can clearly see when gumball man is talking to dream, he isnt looking behind the camera…so
Yeah I don’t got any skin in this game but that moaning video is hilariously bad. Like it’s so convenient that it just so happens that he’s somehow willing to make an account with his own branding and send audio to people, but he’s like  “ah ha, to hide my identity I better not actually say anything!” Despite the fact that the account is already labeled with his branding?
FINALLY a reliable source
This whole thing is like an object lesson in putting barriers between your personal life and internet culture. It's true whether you're an "influencer" or part of the audience. Don't let yourself get manipulated into using emotional reactions as social media "engagement"!
5:36 - 5:45 is now my wake up alarm
How do you claim youre not a pedo, but.. you dont deny sending moaning vids to minors you just refer to it as Revenge Porn?? Like HUh?
I know for a fact dream is a creeper but most of the evidence that comes avainst him is usually fake. But Minecraft YouTubers always turn into creeps. Even the vanossgaming crew said hes a creeper lol
I think dream is probably a pedo but that's basically because he's a weirdo and plays Minecraft. Two of those things in one place is a recipe for disaster.
My house burned down 2 days ago so my thanks giving is going great
The miner doesn't like dreams Minecraft plays, very toxic relationship with steve😢
YOU HAVE DOGGO? 🥹😭♥️
Is anyone actually thankful for twitter other than Elon musk who can profit off of it?
Loving the Shane Dawson reference
Honestly I think plenty of people, at least as far as Twitter goes, are sick of Dream in general which is why the internet sided more with Gumball. The man is a constant source of drama, he weaponizes his fanbase, and I think in 2020 it was so common place for trending to be filled with stuff about him by his tween fanbase that it may be the reason why people on Twitter were sick of hearing about him. Once the face reveal happened Twitter took decided to dunk on him and now anytime something Dream related is trending 9/10 it's Twitter making fun of him. I've seen a case, well, a few cases now, where these sort of allegations end up being true and it honestly wouldn't surprise me - unfortunately, though, in one of those cases some people didn't seem to even care despite the person straight-up being married with kids.
Cumming while passing a kidney stone is not something I needed to know was possible. What has this world come to?
This video has been blessed by Cat™.
Moistgiving celebration
He confirmed the moaning vids lmao
Dreams just needs to take a break, honestly people are very immature and drama driven ever since he shown his face. Yes Dream made the dumbest mistake of responding to every allegations instead of ignoring it, yes he has made stupid mistake in order to look good but does that justify harassment, bully, and defamation on him? No and that goes for the other Youtubers as well.
it was so clear from the start that he can't be trusted around minors
I pray for times than this for Dreams Downfall
o
These guys are absolutely zooted on coke... What else do you get form a bunch of grown adults playing children's games. Absolute degenerate behaviour.
I love how Charlie is always the guy with " _____ Situation is Crazy", dude is cracked
Let's be honest, who's thankful for twitter?
Is it jiminty the cricket or Christmas ?
So is no one going to talk about how we just got a free audio clip of Charlie climaxing at 6:17
that claw game is so cool
hi
If I was him I’d just leave social media. It’s clear that nobody supports him meaning there truly no reason for him to stick around if he can’t deal with the hate.
It’s so weird how he bends over backwards for his 12 year old audience like dude it’s okay
This dream guy is literally just an estrogen pouch
A nIgHtmArE
Didn't dream admit to it tho? Something about saying it's real but she was his "definitely of age" ex or something?
5:37 - This could be taken so out of context 🤣🤣
To everyone crying that the video of the moaning was fake , DREAM LITERALLY ADMITTED THAT WAS HIM AND BACKTRACKED TO SAY IT WAS SENT TO AN ADULT
Happy thanksgiving Charles
Thanks for those first 10 seconds charlie! I hope you and yours have a great Thanksgiving too!
I like how Dream thought people would side with him
I'm no fan of Dream but how is Dream a narcissist??? Also you're giving Dream more or a benefit of the doubt than YandereDev, despite both of them getting accused of the same thing with little evidence.
Ummmmm Mistraction is going on here BIG TIME! Not by Penguin but those in power, set people against each other, just look at the MAGA stuff, we can see here from the UK how you are all being fecked over and it is cases like this that are part of it, Mistract the population, cause trouble between different life styles and then move in with guns when it all goes tits up. Well that is what it all looks like to us. Not saying our government is any better than yours and by government I mean ALL sides.
I've actually never seen anything like this before   The amount of people making heinous lies about the dude just cos they don't like him
He literally said he was texting 16 year old girls💀
Omg is your cat a Maine Coon?
shane and dream r the same person
Bro shouldve never done the face reveal and just faded into obscurity.
It's still wild to me that people ate actually trying to find moral equivalence between Dream and Nick Cantu. One guy has an army of children as fans who he very well may have acted inappropriate and predatory with and can/should go to prison for. The other got shit-faced drunk and started mouthing off and saying a few naughty words.   If I had to pick, I'll take 1000 Cantu's over Dream any day. Not even a debate.
Happy Thanksgiving hope you have a great one 🤟
Some important context - Dream actually did confirm that those moaning audios were real. There’s no question on whether it’s a fake Snapchat account, his claim is that they were sent to someone of age.
When I was younger I loved watching him, now I feel like he’s just another dumb YouTuber who got carried away with fame.
I would never trust a grown man who plays videogames designed for children and which followers/fans are children as well.  Smells pretty bad.
Happy thanksgivings
Even if he says he hasnt done it he lied back then withhis cheating skandal just to admit later that he infact did cheat
Am I supposed to know who the hell this person even is?  Literally never seen or heard of him in my life...
It happens 6:13  it really does happen, I’ve had men and women send me audio clips of them moaning, sometimes even videos of them masturbating. (Not all of them were porn peeps trying to get a subscription, some were people asking me out ad trying to score a date.)
Bro I have never seen a man fall so far from the top after just showing his face 💀💀💀
Thank you for the thanksgiving happy for you too
Charlie my man, do the world a massive favor and never moan again.
Charlie sex sounds unlocked!!!
Dream out here uniting community with hatred. And its just funny to hear that a minecraft dude got his ass beat by gumball waterson
You've got to be very careful when your audience is a bunch of 12 year olds. That being said his job is playing Minecraft so the noncery is almost guaranteed.
Dream may or may not have done many terrible things in his life but he's made one truly unforgivable mistake: not being very attractive in real life. So now all his stans who thought he was a hot twink have turned on him for this betrayal.
gum ball on top
GUMBALLLLLLLL
That’s enough internet for today
Oh look. The next upcoming Onision.
people forget this dude was a grown ass man in his 20s that moderated a minecraft server for fun before he blew up, and people are surprised he’s still a complete weirdo lol
At this point Charlie is national news of the internet
I mean….personally i give Nicholas a pass cuz yk bro is Gumball/Leo VA so im a tad bit biased
Didn’t Dream admit to messaging minors on Snapchat while he was on a livestream? And didn’t he excuse it by saying, “Well yeah, Snapchat is a messaging app”? Did anyone else hear about this or am I actually insane
If there’s something that I learned from everything I’ve gathered is that:  Dream is just an idiot.  And the people who make up allegations all because they hate him, are just unhinged if not insane as Dream himself.
Minecraft speedrun man cant stop being in drama (and being a diddler)
I think Ooompaville covered this a bit better, not defending either but Gumball was underage  in that video and still is underage to even be drinking so it's a lil odd Dream was hanging out with him also Dream claimed he said racial slurs which in the video he didn't he said some other not so great things but Dream exaggerated that video in question before posting it. Doesn't look good to lie like that either.  Gumball still has a chance to turn his life around but Dream has a history of being a dolt.  This is just so stupid all around.
Dream really speedrunning ruining his career
CAT!
I don't think Charlie is real bro. But he should still be a verified news source of the internets.
awesome intro
“I’m not dodgy with kids!! Here let me record this underage drinker have a manic  episode !!! :)”
In all fairness, I am also not thankful for Twitter today, and also every day
I had my video way too loud for the fucking moans to start playing- It jumpscared me tbh.
it’s honestly such a mess that all i’m worried about at this point is the video. nick was having a manic episode and dream thought it was a good idea to give him alcohol (while he’s underaged)??? manic episode plus under the influence is a bad combo, nick was vulnerable and dream shouldn’t have filmed that nor posted it. i just hope nick and anyone else who has been hurt is doing okay
6:03 you should tell that to my girlfriend she wants me singing while I do it.
Ever since he revealed his face, life has been kicking him in the ass, i honestly dont get how people can make fun of him after he made them happy, its mind boggling how horrible human beings are
who is dream never heard of him until now. Every time Charlie post some random youtuber I've never heard of doing some mad stuff.
charlie whY THE FUCK DID YOU ADD THE MOANING VID
Dream having a video of a 19 year old drunk and in a manic state(who is under the drinking age) that he held on to for a year to potentially use whenever nick did something against him should serve as fkkd for thought
Im so glad you're covering this. Your description at the start was pretty much how I was feeling when seeing dream trending. I felt completely alone in my absolute confusion 😅
I've never liked dream but I'm happy that you went over this because I was getting a lot of the same impression. Everything about this is extremely hard to follow and there's no telling what is true or not
finally i have someone to explain this to me instead of just seeing gumball sigma edits
i think dream is inno, but he is an asshole, im 100% he's inno, just look at his fanbase that were on twitter, they were actually delusional and starting nothing over nothing, they would highly overexaggerate the  living hell out of anything and just make up shit constantly, thats why its so messy, becuase its a bunch of made up shit, but i think hes a complete asshole and a narc
Bruh do a video on the Josh Giddey Situation… this shits wild
why do all these gamers have a miner fetish
As weird as Dream is, it’s clear people are taking sides against Dream not based on objective facts, but their pre-perceived character of him. It’s literally just the Minecraft speedrun incident all over again.  Edit: Just so we’re clear, I'm talking about it being an accident. It’s definitely proven unallowed mods were used. I'd recommend watching Karl Jobst's second video on it.
YOOOOO I DIDNT NEEDED TO SEE THE PROVES I BELIEVED YOU
6:19 never been this hard
6:19 ---- I'm feeling it now !!!! Gobble Gobble 🦃
I dont know much about this Dream guy but from what this video alone has shown me, its like an adult in a little boys body. Cringe at best.
You have to understand in these times…everyone only gets 15 minutes of fame. Trend after trend, challenge after challenge. Creators have to go to insane lengths just to stay relevant. Just like we grew up on Mario, kids grow up on Minecraft..& the next generation will laugh at the Minecraft players & throw stones & call them old geezers.   Dream is a narcissist of course, & I really did believe he expected the internet to go crazy & for women to swoon over him when he revealed himself.   His moon has long passed…so all that being said…this is an insane publicity stunt to try & stay relevant. It’s Just how this world is. And you will see crazier & crazier stunts to get your attention or traffic to a certain page. Be careful out there & how you choose to consume media & what you do with your time. Good luck friends!
Sending a vid moaning is so cringe instant turn off lmao dude is in darkness moaning to himself ahahaa
I'm more confused than a homeless man on house arrest.
I stand with gumball when he called Dream the F word for saying thats what the mask is for. 100% facts right there
If this groomer is not going to jail then atleast he should continue to be made fun of by everyone on the internet until the end of times
its incredible how he still has fans to lose
Even though most of what Nic said in the video is horrible, it was funny as hell. I hope he doesn’t get fired from the next TMNT movie.
This guy should have just kept the mask on and learn when to stfu and he would have most of these problems by the sounds of it
Imagine trying to blackmail a 20 year old with cancel culture but it backfires because everyone just hates you more
I see cat, I happy.
05:10
Can't keep his hand out the cookie jar
People in general seem to have the weirdest hate hard-on for the dude. I’m not saying he’s a good guy, I literally don’t know him, but I’ve also looked at this and have seen nothing that proves any wrongdoing.   I think the worst part was his face reveal, when for some reason the entire internet thought it was okay to call someone ugly.   Even his “cheating” scandal was all good in the end, but nobody stuck around long enough to see past the easy hater part.   I genuinely think he’s just easy to hate because he responds to allegations.
dream literally admitted the moaning videos were him and called it “revenge porn” but he’s denying that it was sent to minors
Happy thanksgiving yall
most interesting thing about this video was that it was thanksgiving
Why tf is it always the fucking minecraft youtubers 💀💀💀
I don’t necessarily like Dream. Never seen a single stream. He sounds like he’s self absorbed and annoying. Don’t follow him. Don’t care. But as a victim of trafficking…making up false accusations is almost as bad as the predators.    It makes it SO hard for genuine victims to be believed, get help or get justice. It makes ppl second guess and think victims can be lying. If you lie about SA…then YOU are part of the reason that predators can continue to hurt ppl. You. If you make false accusations you are quite literally HELPING preds. Great job.
I love you bbg
Now I know there is a “classic” meme where a man passes a kidney stone while cumming
Yet another reason I've never and dont plan on making a twitter account. I swear that shit's making people more psychotic than they already were 😔 Also people don't seem to understand how bd works, so lemme clue yall in: you don't just randomly become psychotic, you get extreme mood swings ranging from happiness, depression, anger, etc. And that depends on the person. I personally have random fits of anger from certain pressure points, and it certainly doesn't make me randomly unload said anger on strangers. The gumball guy is just unhinged, and he definitely needs therapy. (I've been informed that some people do actually have manic attacks due to bipolar disorder, though I still stand by my dislike of him if he didn't apologize to the driver. Having a momentary freak out doesn't excuse your actions or recompense, especially to someone who was obviously trying to help you/give you advice) Also this isn't me defending dream, just enlightening some obviously ignorant people 🙌 (including me ig lmao)
thank you charlie for making me listen to some mofo moaning
Other than seeming like an all around awesome guy, I always wondered what Charlie’s real edge was online. Now I see it clearer, he is the coffeezilla of internet content/drama -  somewhere between internet historian and investigative journalist
This absolutely gives me proJared drama vibes. And whereas Jared brought the receipts and called out people bullshitting allegations, Dream's just getting stuck in the drama.
5:15 is a new Charlie meme
Ngl Hate dream all you want You gotta admit That this whole thing is still kinda sad
The thing is, Dream practically confirmed the audio is him; he didn't ever deny it, he claimed "revenge porn" was being posted about him, and was almost certainly talking about those audio clips. Whether or not it was to a minor is up for debate still ofc
If that moaning WAS dream, I actually full on hope he is shamed by everyone for eternity.
Honestly, Dream's haters are just as rabid as his fans. That's why I stopped caring about drama surrounding him.
Shayne Dawson did what???
Don’t hang me, but I don’t think dream deserves what’s happening to him just bc he’s cringe.
I had never ever heard about this youtuber until now, and by the content of his channel I am proud I didn't.
This is what happens when your audience is so underdeveloped, even when your clearly a terrible person, they'll make it as impossible as it gets to figure out what the hell is really going on because they're either too dumb to know how to bring up proper evidence, or are dumb enough to lie about random shit just because they're bored.  Also sad seeing the state Nicholas Cantu is in, I remember him just hanging out with YouTube animators a few years ago in a podcast really chill, seeing that video is a super jarring juxtaposition.
6:19 Babe, new moistcritikal meme just dropped
Don't remove the pets from the room next time, they are cute.
Honestly I clicked because I saw the cat playing on the thumbnail
I'm 40 and I have no idea what's going on and why I'm here anymore.
Happy Thanksgiving Charlie. Your video is gonna be my company since my parents have Covid. Drama is always a good dessert.
I dont think he realizes that hes approaching these allegations in the worst way possible. Dreams lack of common sense and self-absorbed attitude makes him so unlikable, whether the allegations are true or no the publics perception of him is already so negativity
Not only did he send a video with just moaning it sounded like a damn 14 yr old hitting puberty for the first time...
he should have stuck with just playing minecraft💀
Happy thanksgiving everyone!
Happy Thanksgiving Charlie!
I don’t get why anyone is hating on anyone or taking anyones side in this situation they’re both grown ass men with too much money to be acting like this, Idc whose side you’re on you’re wrong…
5:11 you're welcome
Charlie's moans are invigorating
Dream just drops an EDM cover of Toxic Gossip Train
All this internet drama and crazy allegations and yet not a single police report to back it up.
Toxic gossip train 🎶
To all the people without family to celebrate thanksgiving with you are not forgotten.
Regardless of pedo stuff, Dream got (or at least let) Gumball get drunk while underage. Not only this, but he got in a car with him. And then he got a recording (which Dream was concious his friend was filming) of an underage persons drunk ramblings and held it against him. Gumball apologized and made up his mistakes by giving the Uber driver a big tip. Dream, on the other hand, kept the video his friend recorded and published it. Thats all we need to know to judge Dream's character.
10 minutes
Honestly if I was dream I’d drown myself in my kitchen sink
Excuse me what did Shane Dawson do to his cat?!!!
pyro crying rn
HI IO 🐱🐈
"Terminally horny"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
shouldnt have face revealed
Man remember when Dream was some cool minecraft guy who played with his friends? What happened? I’ve lost so much respect for him and now I’m stuck with an overpriced hoodie
Something totally unrelated to the video Anybody else have that moment when you're not really enjoying a video all that much and then you read the top comment and you just laugh and it makes you like the video
Dream didn't record the video of Nicolas
Dream got smoked by a cartoon cat🗿💀
Dream isn’t a Pedo everyone just hates him. I get disliking him but labeling him something as vile as a Pedo based off shitty allegations and clout chasing weirdos is sad.
Happy Thanksgiving, Charlie
This video is a gold-mine for "charlie out of context" clips
Happy Thanksgiving Moist
6:19 Hearing Charlie moaning is the hardest thing to do during NNN
idk whats going on i just want gumball to win
Charlie's epic moaning Montage made me come in my pants.
6:21 GOOD GLORY PLEASE MAKE IT STOP. STOP THE MOANING. PLEASE.
Hearing about this situation feels like getting hit by a bus
This is the biggest DRAMAALERT since EDP.
Ngl I kinda feel bad for Dream. Dude doesn't catch a break at all😂
Lets be fair to Dream, he was smart not to fight with someone DRUNK in a death machine (aka a car)
been thinking, damn where cat, and look there cat
thanks mr. moist i asked and received happy thanksgiving
Dream big L
if you're going to lie about him sending something moaning videos is not on top of the list
Happy thanksgiving 🦃
The news that the VA for Gumball is kinda of scumbag in real life is kind of ruining my plate of seconds. Thanks, Charlie.
The mask should've stayed on.
I do not appreciate the moan jumpscare
6:00 I mean. You'd be surprised 💀
How do I get a chance at the gamersupps claw machine
And on this thanksgiving, Charlie decided this was the day to finally dive into the dream stuff!   Legend 🧐
1 minecraft YouTube vs The legal system. Can Dream beat the Ender Dragon before the swat team raids his house?!
Happy Thanksgiving Charlie! If you see this I have been watching for years and purchasing merch, etc... you are my fave streamer and I hope all is well
why did i decide to play this in the bg i got jumpscared by the snap audio
His speed runs in the beginning was actually pretty cool
I'm honestly so sick of this trend of Twittermites accusing others of horrible things with flimsy evidence. I stand with Dream, I need better evidence than this, Innocent until proven Guilty, my default is to not trust Twitter!
Is Dream a pedo? Csn someone give a simple answer
Dream said it was him in the audios on Twitter
Io looks so fluffy and big now
I can’t help but feel like if Cantù (sp?) wasn’t dunking on Dream, many more people would be dragging him. Lol like, it’s from sheer luck that Dream is so disliked that people aren’t dragging him all over twitter.
Happy Thanksgiving I in Canada so I had mine before
I knew that dude was weird when I seen that face reveal and he can't look at the camera directly. He's always looks like a crescent moon at the camera.
Wake up babe, new Dream lore just dropped.
Always thankful for Io content on this thanksgiving day ❤️❤️
Another content creator situation
Dream should probably just leave that guy alone and stop messaging his fans for sex. Who cares if a voice actor in a cartoon went on some unhinged rant when he was intoxicated and on drugs at 19 years old? The only thing that really funny that came out of this are those weird clips of dream recording himself moaning for some girl
If dream likes miners so much he should go to a quarry like wtf
I just love how everyone just refers to Nicholas Cantu as Gumball and not by his name
it isn't moaning, dream just sent his dark souls gamplay and because obs glitched only sound went through
Happy Thanksgiving IO
I used to want to see the best in Dream and after the grooming accusations a while back i left the fandom for a time because i was tired of the drama. At this point, i dont care. Im just done with him now. I had pity for him and his constant need to *talk* destroyed it.
Definitely not thankful for that moaning video
Happy Thanksgiving Charlie. Ate food today, hang out with family, had a great time.   Hope you have as good day, and a good life. You're a real one
Ok yes  what Gumball guy did was messed up, but somehow dream is still worse off in this situation somehow which both amazes and baffles me
The Charlie out of context tik tok accounts gonna love him moaning
5:10 well now I know what Charlie sounds like when he's going super saiyan.
moaning videos.... Docleave
Gumball vs Dream is something you expect to come from super smash bros not irl
I always thought Dream was some innocent dude. Especially when I saw his face but he’s just a racist creep
This is so funny
Ever since his face reveal, Dream keeps going downhill that evolved into a landslide.
Minecraft youtubers used to be child predators.  Now they are child prey
I live in europe and actually it's my coming of age birthday today!!! We don't celebrate Thanksgiving here, but it's crazy how two such important occasion overlapped hahaha
9:52 THERE WILL BE BLOOD
Isn't Dream a Speedruning  cheater?
Dream is such a little bitch. A guy slaps him and he doesn’t do shit until he’s safe behind his screen
But is sending videos of a guy moaning worse than sending a pice of poop?
Dream is one example someone blessed with fame and money as he likes but sadly not adult enough to be a public figure. Sadly it also apply of most influencers nowadays.
i mean, isnt markipliers main fan base children? or teenagers?
Dream is going through a nightmare now
When dream did his face reveal, ive know this kind of shit he will do😅
Waiting for the clip of Charlie moaning to be memed
Ohhhhh. "Muddying the water" as opposed to clear water. I always heard it as "Muddling".
Its a little weird to me how much actually seemingly hard evidence theres been for over a year, with him saying hes gonna make a video, but only NOW hes decided he needs to debunk everything after its actively effecting his income i will not say hes guilty until he makes his video and says his piece, but to lie about the stupidest things that can and have been disproven makes me think hes not gonna take it as seriously as he should regardless, hes already destroyed his own image in the eyes of a lot of people like whats the point anymore
I mean dream bad, but fukin having a first beer isnt an excuse to be a terrible person and gumball needs to learn a lesson
I don't understand why anyone would interact with an underage audience. You're just asking for trouble, and there is nothing to gain unless you have nefarious intentions.
Happy thanksgiving my american friend's <3
its also the fact that the video dream showed is old and that there is proof he was getting drunk and high with someone under legal drinking age
DREAM THIS DREAM THAT, WHY DON'T Y'ALL DREAM UP A GF.
This Dream guy has to go. Regardless of whether the more serious allegations are accurate, he has accumulated an army of teenaged flying monkeys to do his bidding and that in and of itself is a form of grooming IMO. It’s a cult of personality.
He saved the video for this exact moment. To hold it against him. Glad everyone pointed out that disgusting behaviour out.
OH IV BEEN WAITING ON THIS ONE
Dream starts onlyfans 💀
1st off don't trust anyone or anything on the internet and #2 let local law enforcement deal with ... -Some Lawyers advice whose name I've forgotten
yeah, no, that snapchat evidence is horsecrap, if you wanted to prove it was actually dream they'd pull up the public profile and show the username & everything, but nope! just a black-screen, some audio and some text.  im not saying it's not him in the clip, but that is absolutely not proof by any means.
Talk about Ireland situation
They're cooking Dream more than the turkey...
Man, I still can't get over that cringe face reveal video of his 😂
kitty
Thank you charlie for the moaning sample, which i will proceed to make fake allegations against you.
Been waiting for so long for Charlie to cover this. Thank you!
its honestly amazing people didnt believe he is a pedo. dude is in his 20s and makes minecraft content in 2023....NO ONE MAKE MINECRAFT VIDEOS ANYMORE!!! shoulda been blatantly obvious from the start. honestly yall kinda dumb for not knowing.
I doubt the gumball movie is going to happen at this point
Honestly, I don't think either side has much credibility.  I wound up falling into his fandom for a minute, because I was a fan of some of his collaborators at the time, and wound up seeing a lot of the bad things people were saying about him as a result - but it was always something like "Oh, Dream is a klan member because of something he said in 2016" or "Dream is transphobic because he, a cis man, is capitalizing off the trans community by selling binders" - just baffling statements that cherry picked or recontextualized small moments out of a much bigger body of work which had never given any indication that any of those things were true.  It made me more inclined to pick a side, where I had been pretty neutral on him before.  By the time the first remotely credible grooming allegation came out, I had already seen half a dozen easily-debunked allegations against him and the people in his circle - when the people who hate him already have a habit of making things up to try to destroy his career, it becomes harder to believe any new claims that come out, especially when, as Charlie alluded, the information is so muddy that it's impossible to say whether or not anything actually happened.  In the end, I fell out of the fandom because I was sick of the drama level vs. content output and his dramatic mishandling of the only content that was keeping me in mcyt.  But this gumball situation is really rubbing me the wrong way.  The people who crucified Dream for joking about drugs in rap music are gleefully cheering on Cantu's use of slurs, because they were targeted at someone they don't like.  There's also my personal favorite, "Dream, why were you letting this 20 year old drink anyway?"  The levels to which they hold this guy is astounding.  Like, it is possible for everyone in the situation to be an asshole.
Would you rather be in an argument with Charlie or be in a room with 10000 spiders.
where is the golden pepe statue
As a mentally I’ll autistic person, is no one gonna talk about how nick was in a “manic high” from intoxication ???? Like he is openly bipolar autistic and pansexual how you gonna film someone drunk and in a manic state for blackmail. Actually insane . Having an episode means you’ll say out of context shit .   Not to mention the new burner Twitter acc showing all of the dreams shit
What do think of the giddy situations 😥
get with the program
0:10 that dog just teleported, damn. Your dogs have superpower man.
how tf do you get into beef with the voice actor of gumball?💀💀
Who tf is dream lol
woaahh kitty has gotten wayy bigger
Hey its me, Dream. Yep, that was me moaning.
Dream is creepy ..
I was talking about this with my friends yesterday, the idea of Gumball Waterson just destroying Dream was hilarious to us
The perfect way to start thanksgiving
HAPPY THANKSGIVING EVERYONE!!! Im thankful for all my friends and family even when I hit rock bottom I still had people who never wavered in faith in me and my incompetence i love you all even if i dont know you just remember you are always loved and appreciated
Techno looking down yup Dream still taking those L's.
Happy Thanksgiving everyone. Wish you the best
THE CAAAAAATTTTTTTT
If Dream would just keep his mouth shut about petty drama, he would not get nearly the amount of hate he does. Hating on Dream is a trend that would've died a long time ago if he would just ignore it and move on with his life. It's wild that his reputation is so bad that he can get randomly assaulted by someone he barely knows and he's still made out to be the bad guy in the situation.
Typical Minecrafter. All their gf's are miners.
I'm so glad dream is getting so much backlash, I hated that mf ever since he got popular
kimochi yamete!!!!
dream said in a video yes i did talk  whit a minor in the wrong way because i didnt know her age and went i learn her age i run (but the full video is hard to find )  but those kind of situation is bound to happen went evryone hide behind a screen it happen to me a couple of time where i said to someone on discord or facebook thinking they adult and the go dont said that im 14-15 year old and im like ho fck right nevermind   also that clearly not how shane dawson moan sound ,shane have a way higuer pitch (also he never done anything whit his cat it was a edgy joke shane like edgy joke if it often you its a you probleme (and techinicly event if he did c.. all over his cat ...zoophilia is legal in the state where he was living at the time the "allege" act happen so you wont event have legal ground there)
Dream is the guy who always falls for the bait. I can totally see him as a guy buying into some crypto scam
Am I the only one who wasn't a fan of dream and all the dream smp people
I never thought I would see the day where Gumball whoops Dream’s ass.
To be honest dreams does look like creep and one of those guys youd see in some shady darkweb chatrooms
Keep in mind how many people are mocking Dream, so anyone can fake a video like that 😐😐
i have no judgments for dream until we know with as much certainty as possible what exactly is happening and everything. too many confusing things to have any clear enough opinions, so i'll wait for when things are more clear.
5:07 I need to see that video, i've been laughing crying for 5 minutes just imagining it :D
Lol this poor dude Dream, he cant ever win.
I used to watch Dream's manhunt videos but after he released a video defending all of his stans' bad behavior, I lost all respect for him. And ever since then he just gets worse and worse. I dont know whether hes a pedo or not but in general he really shouldnt be an role model for children. He has a super huge ego while also being super insecure about everything. I dont think we should be hating on dream for stuff we dont know hes done since it takes light off the stuff he has done.   If the truth does come out that the allegations are all false then thats just going to act as a huge shield for him if any hate comes towards his way, even if it has nothing to do with being a pedo. If you hate on dream for no reason then youre just going to make more allies for dream.
Wth is going on. All YouTube is nowadays is, someone doing something and then someone else reporting about it on their channel. Then it creates drama. Then another YouTuber just reports on the drama that’s going on between the 2. Then 100plus other YouTubers talking about the same thing.
THE COOKIES TOO EXPENSIVE
Dream should’ve kept his mask on
Happy thanksgiving Charlie hope you have a great one bro
It would be hella funny if all this was dream running smoke screens just getting everyone he can do put up fake shit so no one knows what’s real and what ain’t
6:18 For Free?!
I don’t follow any of the Dream drama so can someone tell me why he’s so hated other than this stuff cuz it seems like they’ve not like him way before
I cannot watch this video knowing that you shared either revenge porn intentionally framed as pedophilic behavior or true pedophilic behavior. This should not be intentionally distributed regardless of the context. I urge you to please remove this from your video and simply describe the video with words only.
No way a face reveal
didn't dream admit that the audio/snapchats were true, but kinda misconstrued because of a past gf or something??
I had my volume up when that video started playing :")
you can see how confused and kind of sick of the situation Charlie is
someone make some memes of charlie moaning
Charlie's first moan caught me a bit of guard, never heard such a powerful moan lmao
6:22  just say u got no hoes fr 💀
6:18 Banjo-Kazooie sex dialogue
It's weird that all the evidence so far seems to be heavily edited and redacted, or 320x240 resolution recordings of shit you can barely make out and anyone could spoof.  Super weird!  Nicholas told Dream to film him by the way.  Dropping it now is definitely weird tho
THANKSGIVING
If Dream would've stayed faceless. Hes weird and he should stayed faceless if he was going to continue being weird.
When the turkeys dry asf, Charlie’s here to save you😂
Can someone plz tell me what meme he is talking abt at 5:03
You cut off the gumball clip too early lmao should've left in the good part
Day drunk loneliness fuck the holidays and patriarchy hohoho mfs
*Now we got a clip of charlie moaning 😮‍💨* 6:19
As messed up as this sounds being a minecraft streamer as soon a charlie started listing all the allegations my brain jumped into the fact i could see dream pulling some truck shiz….  Moaning vids like idk dream always was kinda a bozo and he always had kids on the channel so i mean 😅. Like look at sky does mc dude was a major chomo so dream could be
AI could make simple moaning sounds EZ.
I knew he is trash when he faked his speedruns. Its a sure way to see if someone is a bastard
Cat
Pyro beat u to this video
dream got it hard from gumball❗❗❗❗❗
Happy thanksgiving everyone.
Charlie is the type of guy to say *A.* after the sentence
Go eat man, it's Thanksgiving. Have a good one. 🥧
Dream in the tweet you put as the thumbnail literally admitted that the videos were real by calling it “revenge porn” 💀
That section of Charlie moaning sounds like a Banjo-Kazooie character
Charlie discovering modern sexting and calling it weird and unreal is unreal
This isn't dream, this is a nightmare.
I'm just glad people are starting to realize more he's not as great as all the dream stans made him out to be
habby thanksgibbing!!!!
i WAITING for you to cover this!!!
Dream is now a nightmare
Isn't this the same kid who hired a lawyer to lie about a lego game battle?
Gonna be honest. I'll never feel bad for Dream 😅
Now Josh Giddey is up to no good
Dream getting violated by Gumball Waterson was not on my 2023 bingo card.
7:20 thats Leonardo!
dream should get ludwig to do damage control like he tried and failed to do with poki lmao
losing to gumball watterson is wild
Notice the "Are you Jewish?" when hes listing all of his success but it cuts out lol totally not a "stereotype"
I'd like to imagine Charlie had a whole wall full of tweets connected to each other via strings, like a mad conspiracy theorist.
shane dawson never fucked his cat, c’mon charlie i thought you were smarter than this.
This video showed me Charlie knows nothing about erotic chat
minecraft youtuber try not to be a pedophile challenge (impossible)
so not only we got dream getting trashed but we also got charlie moanning FOR FREE?????
I don’t like dream but other dude is an even bigger pos
Imagine supporting the person whos clearly in the wrong 💀💀 Classic twitter, a melting pot of braindead homosapiens. 😂😂
DREAM DID WHAT
Gumball went through 3 voice actors. Nicolas Cantu was the last one. just a bit of trivia.
Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family too.
ok but seriously who is dream?
what is weird is: Both Cryotic (or chaoticmonki if you prefer) and dream have similarities. both have a thing for minors and both had VERY ressembling pseudo characters. (a smiling, full while entity with very basic/simple facial expression and art. they are also strangely alike if you consider alot of dream`s fan-arts before his face reveal and cryotic`s fan arts as well.) its too... eerie and bizarre.
Honestly the part of this thats funny to me is that dream posts the video of gumball, talking all that shit and what not, as like a gotcha moment and i honestly could not care less what thise 2 say or do, but it is still great he did that and didnt consider the angle of like "if it's so bad, why were you holding onto this months, and only released it when you thought it'd be useful for you"
No way Charlie made a video on the gumball dream drama
wrong video to eat to
At this stage it's better for dream to get off twitter. Heck just take a break from social media and go camping or some shit. Learn crafting in real life.
Ntgl they are both just pathetic. Thats it, no winner here.
there was also the fake texts with the uber driver that dream posted in replies of the video. there are a number of things that show the texts are fake: 1. dream starts the text with "i'm the guy from the uber" the text was yesterday, it was confirmed the incident happened 2 months ago.  2. you can see in the uber video the driver has an iphone, in the text screenshots (which are in imessage) the chat bubbles are green when they should be blue. 2. who has their uber in their contacts??? and its just uber driver not even a number or anything like what
What exactly does a response video actually do?  We've seen how valueless his personal input is with the whole minecraft speedrunning video.
Man is a legend for uploading on thanksgiving
6:19 for Charlie's moans. Your welcome
So Dream is the new mini ladd? Wtf
happy thanksgiving 2 everyone watching this
I wanna set the record straight on 1 thing Charlie said and its that dream didn't record Nick Cantu, it was Dream's friend and Nick Cantu asked to be recorded while going on his rant. So dream didn't just hold on to that video as blackmail or something he asked his friend for the footage when this happened. (Not a Dream fan)
Dream making ppl side with a drunk 20 year old voice actor/asshole is definitely baffling to say the least. Happy holidays everyone!!
Charlie has entered the arena. Dream is actually fucked now.
Dream is a lying cheater. You don’t need to make up stuff to make him seem worse than he already is.
Dream situation is crazy
Nicolas was also 19 in that video dont forget that part
Ehh, Logan Grove is my Gumball.
Honestly does anyone genuinely care about this drama that deeply? I feel its mostly just comical
did dream lift the drama NDA or something on the commentary channels? everyone's suddenly talking about it
Why does Cantu sound like he smoked twenty packs of cigerettes
Can we get a episode of the official podcast about this?
1:21 Top 10 class Charlie jokes
5:18 Oh, so that's why he was screaming in agony. He simultaneously passed both nut and stone.
*“Man it doesnt matter if shes 15 ma ni-“*
Dream is probably proud of himself for having you do a video about him. He's disgusting.
dream: exists a blue cartoon cat: so you have chosen... death.
MMMYES CAT AND DOG
you did not do your research. disappointing
he said Dreams moaning would be the worst jumpscare ever ? Did he forget EDPs giant TURD ?
bro pyro and moist are in sync there is no way
Like I get it...Dream has people who hate him for no reason other than how he looks or because he's a minecraft Youtuber then people who hate him also for these allegations, far as I know, still not proven without a shadow of a doubt. I feel like it's so trendy to hate on Dream that people are just ignoring this dude disparaging Down Syndrome people, using homosexual slurs, calling someone retarded, stereotyping Jews, using whatever disorders he has as an excuse like...wtf? Because he's drunk?  If I drink drive and kill someone, it's fine because I was drunk right? No control over my actions? If I get drunk and assault someone, all good? I was drunk yeh? I get drunk and say all this wild stuff, post on Twitter some racist hateful stuff, it's fine? I was drunk?  Like...people don't get a pass because you're drunk. that's not how the world works. If you're drunk, you're more than likely speaking what you really feel because you lose inhibition and that filter that normally stops you from saying your thoughts out loud. Yet somehow people are still hating on Dream in this scenario? lol is there more? Am I missing something from this video?
Happy Thursday, from Canada 🇨🇦
Bumballs voice actor is literally gumball. Wtf.
Also why are y’all jumping on this when yall only have one side of the story? At least have the decency to wait for the other party to attempt to prove their innocence before yall form an opinion. Like does everyone’s critical thinking skills leave when it comes to someone they hate? Like I’m incredibly disappointed in Moist I thought he was a pretty neutral guy and looked into situations but after this I’m unsure anymore.
been waiting for this one
I miss who i was 40 seconds before hearing that moaning clip
If any of this turns out to be true, can we please silently agree to retire that blank, smiley face avatar guy?   I can't take a third guy ruining the lil man :(
Keep dream away from instruments for this apology video, we've already had enough of that, and also interpretive dance, please, no more, or at least a more original way of making the worst apology yet.
I don't think Dream is all that douchey I think he just needs to learn to shut up and let things play out. He literally kicks himself in the foot.
I don't like the VA of Gumball and Dream so... meh
As a canadian, we had thanksgiving a month ago. But i still feel thankful for this banger of a vid
bro i have been so confused as to what’s going on, glad to see charlie covering it all
6:18 confirmed how Charlie moans
Eating thanksgiving dinner while watching 😂😂
In todays culture, I don't see it as weird, or out of place at all that the first thing a person would do is reach for their phone and start recording.
I have been following this for a little while. I don't watch dream, but I did watch amazing world of gumball, and I find it very amusing that dream got beat up by a drunk kid
6:25 are you feeling it now mr krabs
Can't believe JakePaul  and Alissa violet broke up... what is going to happen to Team 10?
I swear 2023 has been the year of Youtuber drama 😅
Black
thanks for the moaning video moist
ion like how it promotes the idea that people who are manic say slurs. everyone’s saying “he was drunk, he was manic!!” so? unless you’re already okay with saying that shit you’re not gonna say it inebriated. ion like the message it sends about ppl who are drunk/manic
I’m a fucking victim of dream after hearing that moaning audio😭
bruh every public person is into miners nowdays like guys let them mine in peace
What a load of outraged nonsense. This generation are just the worst.
For anyone who's lost. I'll explain a little bit:  After his face reveal on October 2022 he got two accusations of grooming, one by a girl called Anastasia (that people say was quickly disrpoven but idk) and one by a girl called Amanda (who Dream admitted he talked to on Instagram for a couple of months, even sending her his Snapchat account, but denied having had anything inappropriate with, while she says they sexted on Snapchat, but only showed evidence of flirting and not the sexual part). I don't know if any of those cases count as grooming, but they were both fans and underage, so that's where the criticism comes from. Dream waited for Amanda to sue him so he could sue back for defamation but she never did so it stayed at that.  This November, when the fight with Cantu was happening, a new Anonymous account appeared that showed screenshots of a conversation from 2019 in which a girl called Jamie sent someone else the videos. On the screenshot you can see the girl's twitter, and bc of that people found out Jamie was 16 at the time, and Dream 20. Jamie's account is private, but she changed her bio to "leave me tf out of this", so there's no statement on her part. Dream called the videos "revenge porn" so people are assuming he confirmed it was indeed him in the clips, but that they weren't sent to a minor. These last few days a new account showed up accusing him of grooming but this one was very clearly fake and a troll. The girl admitted it was all fake and Keemstar used that to say "girl who accused him admits she faked it" (very misleading). Yeah, it's all very messy
I'm grateful for watching gumball slap tf outta dream
People trying to act like dream is bad for giving alcohol to someone "underage" is really weird to me. Like 18 is a grown ass adult in the us. My country had a drinking age of 19 so maybe thats why i dont get it? Just really weird to me to not consider a 19 year old as an adult
I want to hug his big fluffy cat♡♡
I think it's such a waste of time to read twitter arguement
I can already see the clips of Charlie moaning
We really got Gumball vs Dream before gta6
PYRO DID IT FASTER
dream did what
Dream revels his face Shortly after : ALL HELL BRAKES LOOSE . 🎉
Dreams problems would’ve never been nearly as bad if his ass stayed off twitter and actually kept his fans in check ☠️
I've been hearing a lot of people talk about how Dream admitted it was him on his private twitter, but I could not find where he stated it.
Imagine being known as the guy who faked a seggs incident about dream, what a loser
Dream should've kept the mask on
Can't believe a guy who cheats at competitive gaming isn't a great person
Thank you gumball for carrying this dream drama 👍👍👍👍♥️
When we're talking about serious crimes, it shouldn't matter how believable a claim is. It should only matter how strong the evidence is.
Cat
I don’t get why all of these commentary channels are sharing the moaning video. Like if either side is proven right it’s still an illegal thing to share??? Like if Dream is right y’all are sharing revenge p*rn and if the alleged victim is right then you’re sharing someone m*sturbate to a child? How is most of Twitter “right” if the majority are making light of the situation and telling anyone supporting Dream horrible things. Either side is a serious matter, and none of y’all seem to care and only see “haha cringe Minecraft YouTuber I hate is a kiddie diddler, lets doxx his house and put other people who have nothing to do with it in danger.” First time I’ve ever disagreed with moist.
Iam so glad thag iam not famous. Fuck Twitter/X that shit is CRAZY!
Dream should never have been given the clout he has. He clearly can't handle someone telling him no and is willing to cheat and backstab, not to even necessarily get what he wants, but to make himself look better.
Happy Thanksgiving
the fact that people still support dream is crazy
I was doing some studying while listening to this and when Charlie started screaming out of nowhere it scared the crap out of me XD
I mean dream is a pedo soooo... Huge gumball W
One of the few videos by you I can say without a doubt did not have enough information. If you didn't plan on covering the issue properly, you shouldn't have even made a video. Missed far too many details about this, including dream being caught in multiple lies.
I have never celebrated thankgiving cus im aussie but happy thankgiving :)
Ever since the face reveal Dream has been losing to reality
Bro cheated speedrunning minecraft, he doesn’t deserve respect in my opinion
6:20 yeahhh gonna save that real quick for…*research*
I remember Gumball from Minecraft Monday
[Person] situation is [adjective]
dont think anyones thankful for twitter
lets be honest, this is all probably a ruse orchestrated by dream himself. fake accounts, comically off-based accusations, the allegations themselves being a meme of what allegations are. And we're all talking about it
Nah how do u get bitched my gumballs Va, he’s always hitting a new low
Good ol drugs
Might as well change the name to Nightmare..
You have a beautiful cat Charlie
somebody clip charlie saying "i just wanna fill you up princess" out of context please
Charlie woman love morning nut videos
hey @penguinz0, it’s not just a video of him ‘dry moaning’, the text says “i’m so close” so i’m assuming he’s also touching himself. idk how to preface that and alr regret commenting but i just wanted to correct what you said, hoping we’re now 1 step closer to the truth
Imagine having beef with Gumball watterson….
It's easy to make yourself popular just create false accusation about someone like dream who's hated by internet   I hate dream but i hate those kinds of people more
i gotta thank god for letting that idiot get clocked
Io seems happy about this, I hope you give her plenty of treats❤
Why is it all of them? I didnt even like Dream and it turned out he was a creep, but why is it that like literally almost all Minecraft Youtubers end up being creeps? It's not even funny to joke about anymore, because it feels like at least 6 times out of 10 it turns out they're actually just that disgusting
Who needs viagra, when you have 6:19.
the question is why are minors on such platforms?
Something funny ab charlie not knowing a lot of women really like moaning audio its a common thing LMFAOO women and men are terminally horny
Hell yeah for da kittens!!
Also Dream did not record it.
Sounds like your average "famous" person smear job
regarless of all these things wether dream is guilty or not, lets all agree that making fake accusations about dream is disgusting behavior, you deserve prison time for that imo.
Well I’ve experienced people sending moaning messages to me, but they weren’t dudes, no. And it was requested, and they were the same age as me.
I want to know what Io thinks of the whole situation, we need her input
Video aside, Happy Thanksgiving, Charlie.
as a jew, whenever someone asks "are you jewish" there's a part of me that worries for my life and safety. I usually say "yes" and look into their eyes to see their intentions. I can't show fear either or else it'll get worse.
that moaning video Is outrageous
Isn't there a Tweet about Dream saying that posting the moaning audio was revenge porn or was that the parody account?
Sending someone a moaning video is a very personal thing. Creeps don't do that.  Creeps are low-effort. They'll just send a dick pic.
I'm inclined to believe the drunk guy over dream imo😅
Gumball should've bought Darwin with him next time
This sounds like something gumball would do
Hey charles, ik this has nothing to do with the video but I found my old yugioh cards I had as a kid and i don’t believe in reselling something i have no passion about. do you have any contacts that would enjoy a donation of yugioh cards?
"Dreamsexuals" are gonna have a field day with this one
I’m shocked about Nicholas’ behaviour, but that’s what you’d expect from a drunkard. Dream does the shit that got him into these controversies in complete control. It’s embarrassing to know that he’s a grown ass man yet he is whining like a baby.
Dream who
This all started with a parody account😹😹😹😹
So basically rn there is zero evidence dream did anything with minors. Also they're saying that he was 20 and she was 17? Isn't that legal in alot of states anyway because of Romeo and Juliet laws? This whole drama sounds like a nothing burger to me
Bro why are we getting a video when you should be with the Charlie clone family smh
The only Dream content I've ever seen was when he joined the OTV Among Us lobby, and all I thought of him was that he and his friends were 1 weird AF, 2 dumb AF, he has done nothing but cement that opinion of him.
FINALLY A VIDEOOOOO OF THE DREAM SITUATION
Have a good thanksgiving!
The new movie in the Children Cinematic Multiverse: Dream vs Gumball
Quick update for those who don’t know, the moaning in this video was actually dream. Dream confirmed it, called it revenge porn, and said it was to an above age women. Doesn’t seem likely after everything we’ve seen him do.
As soon as i deleted twitter, dream gets dragged by the gumball voice actor
I wonder if dream is gonna hire a maths professor to prove his innocence
I had to repeat 6:18 several times it was so random
I cannot express this enough I DO NOT CARE about dream at alllllll. Dude could legit go off and be a farmer for the rest of his life or be in prison and it wouldn't change my life either way. However it REALLY scared the shit out of me how quickly and fast the internet will just believe anything about you if it doesn't like you. Even if the reason for not liking you is valid, this whole thing is based off of the fact that those moans sounds like Dreams, there's no messages, no profile, no confessions, nothing just it sounds like the guy. Regardless of whatever happens or comes out that IS scary.
There are so many online sleuths that have obsession like tenacity - If there's anything out there, those folks are going to find it.  There's no covering tracks .
I'm thankful for Charlie dropping this banger video covering this huge drama, happy Thanksgiving!
Why’d you make this video
im thankful for gumball fucking watterson
Pyrocynical beat you to it. Oh no!
Have a good thanksgiving Charlie
I wonder if Dream's going to press charges against the Gumball guy. Even though I dislike Dream, I find the Gumball voice actor to be cringe and chronically online just like Dream. I hope he gets charges against him and IF dream actually is a pedo and not just a cringe guy, then I hope his victims press charges, though it's been about a year with no charges pressed yet.
All because he showed his face
love your videos daddy
1:55 Don’t forget his stans Charlie
Two bad takes in a week. A new record for Charlie.
All I've gathered from this entire shitshow of a drama are three certainties: 1. Dream and the Gumball voice actor guy had a falling out 2. Gumball voice actor guy accused him of being a pedophile and Dream's Stanbase took the ball and ran as far as they could with that one, naturally 3. Dream is a massive attention whore with an inability to keep his mouth shut
cat carried the video
The mask can't hide his p*do crimes.
I am glad I have an actual life to live and not dwell on useless twitter drama
I hope you have a great thanksgiving!
Charlie I would’ve believed you without having to hear the awful moaning I think I need a christening now
I only remember when Dream did that "big reveal" of his face and like that's the only time I've heard of him.  Then suddenly this drops and I'm like.... even if you are innocent bro why would you smear your own image so badly all the time with the idiotic things it sounds like you have been doing for a few years now and then act like a surprised Pikachu face when people start making some hard allegations against you?  Dude doesn't have his priorities straight either way.
i am thankful this thanksgiving for dream getting his ass handed to him by gumball
As a Canadian, I always feel like I clicked on an older video by accident whenever they mention thanksgiving in an American video.
Conspiracy theory: This is all just a scheme to have so much false allegations out there that it's hard to believe any of them, and so he gets little pushback on them. Incredibly stupid instead of just being genuine and candid and debunking them, but knowing what dream's like, this theory sounds plausible
Yeah, see? That's why i try to avoid these situations all together, you never know who to trust.
I dont say this in a mean way to anyone else other then Dream, but he thrives on mental illness. I think anyone who watches him have some kind of issue. This is coming from someone who has issues of his own. Ive seen a lot of things, including in real life. The other part are kids who have no idea whats even happening. They just see Minecraft
this video has me cringing way too much, from someone moaning to a man passing a kidney stone while orgasming...... really killed it charlie
Dream Situation is Crazy
I swear that man is always getting into some stuff 💀
This is like the 10th I heard allegations of someone being a pedo. Jeez what is wrong with society that everyone’s role mode is the subway spokesperson. Am I missing something like how I can’t fathom feet fetishes or comprehend how someone can even find a interest in the most grossest part of the body. What made the world turn upside down?
Dream confirming that moaning video was him was crazy, he needs a lawyer 😂
"I can't imagine sending a clip of you moaning"    -Roblox community......
*HEAD'S UP.* 3:53 - 4:08 Alleged Dream Moaning. Feel free to skip to 4:09
Dream literally just kept that as blackmail because HE KNEW he would do it again, and be caught for it, so he uses it as if it will distract people of calling him a gr**mer. Thats fucking insane that he EXPECTED to get caught!?!?!
unlike most pregnant women dream always fails to deliver.
I might be wrong about this, but I'm pretty sure Dream directly confirmed that the moaning audio was his, but the person in question he sent it to was not underage. It was, according to him at least, a person he was fooling around with at the time, who suffers from a few mental ailments, and has apparently slandered him on stream a few times before.
I watched Sensitive Society and Optimus talk about the situation a couple days ago and according to them the Nicholas video was recorded months before the controversy began and supposedly Nicholas apologized publicly the day after the video was recorded, they claimed Dream held onto the video for months only to release it once the allegations against Dream gained traction and used it to redirect people's attention towards Nicholas.  Just to be clear I'm taking both SS and Optimus' videos with a grain of salt, I do not know how credible they are so do with this information as you will.
I saw this and just thought,  "... again...?"
Dream did his face reveal and his career has gone down the toilet
dream ? more like gream cuz he grooms
6:19
5:49 It's called B minor
No matter if he's guilty or not of the various horrendous things he's been accused of, when it comes down to it this is a case of knowing:  1: when to shut up and stay quiet to not muddy the waters or make yourself more guilty looking 2: how *not* to handle a fanbase.  you can't be friends with your fans. there are very few times it's ended well. there will always be a power dynamic imbalance, no matter how hard you try to destroy it, because your fans idolize you, and are willing to lie to talk to you, as well as whatever it takes on more desperate occasions. and with how big he's gotten, this is even more important to consider. and yes, as much as adults like myself enjoy minecraft and content surrounding it, IT IS A KIDS GAME AT HEART. it is going to attract more kids than adults. especially with how Dream makes his content like manhunts and challenges, that's in the vein of kids youtube, even if he's more mature (swearing, adult humor etc). (but, let's be real here, we all grew up with MCYTs who were cursing and making all sorts of jokes back in the day, then again back in the early 2000's things were different). Dream, by replying to every single tweet, threat and hate fan, is muddying the waters and making things worse. the more he talks, the more people pick at his words, and cause more drama. if he'd shut up and take a moment to collect evidence and not respond bit by bit, but all at once, it'd be better. sadly on the internet it's guilty until proven innocent, which, I don't care how much you hate Dream, I dislike him as well and I used to watch him, we *cannot* just start making shit up because we hate him. it makes things worse for all sides.
both parties suck even if dream getting smacked is hilarious, world would be better off if they fought again but it was to the death this time
"i dont think anyone is so terminally horny that they would send a video of themselves moaning". Bro we had edp send a picture of his shit to a minor while being terminally horny, i dont think a moaning video is considered too far lol
Im terrified by the fact that the new generation is so willing to make fake allegations and evidence maliciously for clout. Maybe some of it is true, but the vast amount of it is just truly evil scum behavior
I love charlies confusion in this video
Sicko dream
dream is so weird '
I was getting something out the fridge when the moaning started and I genuinely rushed to grab my phone and skip past it
I understand dream how would you let someone punch you then proceed to get into an Uber with them right after especially if you don’t know them
I just wish that people like BBH, awesamdude, and punz (Dream’s friends) realize that he is a bad person and stop supporting him. Because I honestly love BadBoyHalo(BBH) he’s one of my favorite MC creators. So I hope they get steered in the right direction.
You didn’t even cover anything
**Earphone warning** 5:10-5:12 6:19-6:25 I CANNOT wait to see what people do with that. Such voice acting should be paid for first. 😂 I'm grateful for your style of journalism, Charlie. Happy Thanksgiving.
He thought it was time for a head reveal 👀
wonder if he’s gonna talk about forsen
Im upset he didnt go over the Uber Driver texts dream posted. Shit was so funny
i think if dream is really innocent, he can just say, who ever is spreading false claim of him hell file lawsuit for defamatory. then log off. if hes innocent he can just let the law prove him right, he deosnt need to explain it to anyone
Why can't people just leave kids alone man 😭😭
dream did not recorded him !!! in the taxi where more people and cantu himself said yeah filmed me !!
Anyone have the kidney stone video?
Honestly, I've just learned that it's best to assume that any Minecraft YouTubers are pedophiles.
I moan at my wife all the time😂
Just how i expected to spend my thanksgiving
You know your reputation is in the gutter when Kantu, the guy you're up against can on video say the most heinous shit and act like a complete shit head and yet you are still the one who loses
gumball ftw.
blud shoulda sticked to mine craft
Charlie and his animals wishing us an amazing Thanksgiving has fulfilled my day.
Man these dramas are crazy, we got the MrBeast African Well drama and now this? What's next?
thanks for keeping me updated in zoomer news penguinz0
On the annoying clip with gumball guy, you guys gotta understand theres this aura of "ok kid" whenever a dude with his stature and especially the curly hair. Your venacular entirely changes when people let you get away with saying the most unlikeable shit cause they dont take it seriously. Gumball still a G in my eyes just gotta be more self-aware bro, not everyone is in it.
Never thought there would be a dream situation in 2023
3:59 tbf tgat shit is NOT dream, sounds litteraly nothing like him
Sorry to be that guy, but technically its "X". (not to be rude or anything)
i don’t think dream did anything wrong, i think he’s had haters constantly for no real reason
0:05   CAT BASS CAT BASS
Moar cats!
His worst crime is cheating in block game
yeah the moaning can be generated by ai !!!
there is some goofy ass voice clips I can get from this video
People do not understand that making allegations of criminal behavior is always defamatory. This can end up really badly for people throwing around accusations that are not true.
man i really wish i never heard that audio
Gumball 🔛🔝
6:18 I've never been more turned on in my entire life
I am thankfull for the cat and dog at the begining
Passing a kidney stone whilst cumming? This sounds exactly like the kind of video I want to trick someone into watching. Link?
This year is going out with bang
This is Gen Z's OJ Simpson trial.
YES GAWDD
Its also really hard to tell if any allegations are true now because of AI voices and all the shit AI can do
About the dream moaning clips, dream himself confirmed that those were indeed him. So we can actually confirm that he did that. 4:12
dreams def a pedophile because hes always been a creep so it would make sense
He's really playing with fire giving us audio clips of him imitating moans
The minecraft YouTuber?! Impossible
U should've given a warning before the moaning ⚠️⚠️⚠️
Cant wait for him to hire a Harvard professor to calculate how he couldn't have done any of that
Kinda funny ppl can completely lie about dream and ppl hate him enough to believe it or at least want it to be true 🤣
Im glad Pyro gave Charlie the green light to finally post this video 💗
I ain't reading allat 💀🗣️
My turkey got a little less good
Oh, I thought this was about the new A24 movie. Bye
Happy Thanksgiving everyone
happy thanksgiving
Gumballs manic ramblings and fucking with dream makes me moister than an oyster. Truly the ideal grippy sock manic psycho bf
Is this just the Youtuber exit strategy now? Just get caught up in shit and bleed subscribers until there's none left?
when did dream posted thirst traps ?? this is so false
Dream did confirm that he did the moaning but it was supposedly with an ex and she's using it against him. But that has also been possibly proved to be false as well. I'm just as confused with this whole situation
CATTUS! It's an excellent video even after 5 seconds!
I literally don’t know what is real anymore when it comes to this drama lol
Gumball fucking Watterson the PDF-File hunter, that being said he was acting like a dickhead while under the influence in the Uber ride, Dream blackmails him and instead of folding he lets his hands fly. Respect to gumball
This beautiful cat is enough Christmas presents for the holidays
Can't wait for the SunnyV2 breakdown later~
I can't believe gumball was in the beginning of Charlie's video 😭
Charlie's moaning is now my ringtone
Happy Thanksgiving everyone Charlie love the vids. Hopefully, you have a good Thanksgiving
I can’t breathe when you’re not there
Dealing with my own drama this Thanksgiving . Good luck to everybody dealing with drama out there today.
I was not expecting you to play the moaning video…
Dream is a nonce, nuff said.
if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.
imagine my shock when a minecraft youtuber turns out to be a pedophile
He literally admitted it was him 😭
Charles, I hope y’all also have a good Thanksgiving cause I am getting stuffed right now
the uber driver must have questioned his existence
The moan doesn't sound anything like dream's voice lol
But dream ain't even record it, right?
Charlie has been eating good on streamer drama
You and turkeytom are the only ones that seem have an actual thought out opinion about this situation and it’s scary
Dream is a very sus individual from what I know (and I know very little, full disclosure) but the burden of proof is always on the accuser.
Ah yesss I've been waiting for this video luv u Charlie happy Thanksgiving ❤❤
Man, I love watching you. Since I 90% of the time, I have no idea who these people are.
10 out of 10 video!!! Io and Puppy!!! 10/10!!!! TT^TT
Bruh
Everything I've learned about this goofball was not learned voluntarily
Dream better bust out the ukelele for this one
Imagine celebrating someone getting assaulted
I don’t like Dream but it’s crazy how people will take anything as the truth if it’s against someone they personally don’t like.
6:20 this is going inthe out of context video
the fact dream got assaulted and nobody gives two shits is so hilarious to me.. did he expect us to feel bad?
Charlie’s hair looks so much thicker and healthier!?
All I'm gonna say is the black screen moaning bit from a dude is sadly very real and happens a decent amount lol some guys think girls get off to it ig lol it's cringy asf
I love that the bots are now evaporating from charlies comment section
Oh man that moaning video had me shivering with cringe
THAT'S WHAT THE POINT OF THE MASK IS
one of those moans was a bit too real
Charlies moan is so much hotter than the "Dream" moan
Dream confirmed the moaning videos were real when he called it "revenge porn"
I miss the person I was before hearing dream moaning to a minor
I was not ready for the Charlie moaning audio
You shouldn't defend him for free, make him hire a professional mathematician to calculate the odds of it being his voice.
Correction Charlie: No one is thankful for Twitter
Literally nothing dream can do could redeem himself, the guy is literally just an egotistical lying piece of shit.  That doesn't change anything about drama with the gumball guy, I just fucking hate dream.
Damn. New season of TAWOG lookin fire 🔥
I was wondering ŵhen you were gonna make this video 💀
Even Gumball hates dream
noo its just the weirdest people that send that stuff to people (someone i knew did that to me so yeah sjshhavs)
can we clarify he did say "this is revenge porn". which in my eyes, is his him admitting to it being him & being real.
I wonder if Dream is mentally ill.
I sat at home alone, broke, and no food 🙃
dream can drop proof of gumball being a shitty person but cant drop any proof of him not being a groomer
I died when charlie started to moan hahahaa
Dream face reveal = Disaster  Critikal face reveal = second coming of jesus
A lot of "________ situation is crazy" videos lately.
you mean the guy who orchestrated a full falsified scientific defense when he cheated a speedrun and intentionally builds a parasocial connection with his audience of kids turned out to be a creep?  well color me surprised, i never could have fucking guessed  i do understand that there's no solid evidence, and to be clear i genuinely hope i am wrong, but this all is a classic "downfall of a big internet name" scenario. i may not like the guy personally but i hope that this is all genuinely false and he can get back to doing his thing.
Who??
At this point if I see an adult Minecraft YTuber I just assume there's some dirty laundry there.
Most girls complaining that their man never makes noise in bed. Meanwhile Charlie: 6:19
Thanksgiving was a month ago...
Everyone sees the memes on twitter and Instagram then comes to YouTube to comment the same meme they saw
Why would you play dream moaning without a silly warning XD? I did not expect to be blasted with cringe today.
Gumball and dream is the two words that I was least expecting to be in thw same sentence together
Oh how this was expected, but unexpected at the same time.
He's never posted a thirst trap😭 he barely shows any skin, where's like 3 layers at all times
Every time I’ve ever looked at his social media (not very often) he’s either being accused of grooming a minor or posting a 9 paragraph essay 😭😭
Friendly reminder, he knew he cheated in that speed run then waited 4 MONTHS to say anything and when he did it was on his second channel with 10% of the subs the main has.
Dream is like the x-men of controversy. To his very dna he's mutated to be in it.
5:10 CHARLIE I WAS LISTENING TO THIS OUT LOUD IN THE KITCHEN WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU 😭
Dream has been incredibly problematic from the start, he can't resist not getting into drama  But the fact the voice actor of gumball, of all people, was the one that destroyed dream is really funny
Dream is a goof.
More backstory than FNAF at this point
HEHE
Someones gonna take those charlie moans outta context and try to cancel him lmao
What’s he talking about with a guy cumming while passing a kidney stone?
very cute and fluffy calico cat
Can we get more cat content
“i don’t think anyone has ever been so horny that they…” already lost. literally no matter how you end that sentence you’re probably wrong😂 because yes they have💀 someone, somewhere, has been that horny
My prayers for his downfall have been answered 👏🙌
dream more than likely never going to post a video. he's been claiming to be working on it for over a year now. he's not capeable of anything more than playing victim.
Dream genuinely deserves all the misfortune life has to offer.
This is the most random beef of all time. In what Universe are we living where Gumball and Dream have a feud
By the way to the people defending Can2, y’all do realize him saying slurs and awful shit didn’t come out of no where. When you’re drunk that the real you not some illusion. Dream didn’t put those words in his account.
JunkyJanker gotta be one of my favorite voice actors
gumball could eat an orphan in front of me and I would still side with him against dream.
Eh, I believe Dream did it. This isn't Dream's first brush with pedophilia allegations, and it probably won't be the last. I could be wrong and I will recant if the evidence is convincing, but you'll forgive me if my trust in a Minecraft YouTuber's innocence is nonexistent.
I’m not a dream fan I rather die tbh but that moaning audio seems faked. Bigfoot sightings has better quality than those pixels, tf did they film with? A spoon?  And they didn’t show the actual Snapchat username which would confirm if it actually was dream or some weirdo willing to do this  Won’t be surprised if it’s real however, but I don’t believe all of the allegations are real the internet loves to stir shit up for momentarily entertainment
I kept getting hints about this situation but I did not want to read into it, thank you for doing it for us 🙏
Minecraft YouTuber 🤷‍♀️
3:45
Another Minecraft kiddy lover. Who woulda thought…
Yo
Dream has actually acknowledged the moan tho and called it revenge p for leaking it
I have never heard a single positive thing about dream
Happy Thanksgiving 🦃 👍
Bro IO is such a cute cat :D
Charlie you didn't have to put me through those moans, I will now be talking to my therapist next week about this because that caused me to be very disturbed  The only human being you should be sending moaning voice messages to, is yourself or  your partner/spouse not some random hoe you just started talking to 💀
Dream is literally the new shane Dawson
Thanksgiving
really loving this weeks’s joke
this thanksgiving is the best because of charlie
6:26 has insane potential
Why is everyone surprised about Dream? He IS a Minecraft YouTuber after all
Dream is literally the new shane Dawson
Welcome to the ambiguous, amorphous hellscape of drama that has made discerning the truth of anything completely impossible for the last year.
this wasn’t on my 2023 agenda but im here for it 😂😂😂
Honestly at this point this whole debate is just an endless stalemate. Dream and his supporters have taken their side and the haters and have taken their side and NOTHING will convince either side to change their mind. The haters will eat up anything that has even a passing resemblence to evidence against Dream and twist anything he says aginst him. They will cover their ears and go "LAH LAH LAH CAN'T HEAR YOU" when such evidence is debunked. The same can be said for his supporters in the case of evidence in favor of Dream.
Nicolas is queer and is allowed to say the f slur lmao that’s why people weren’t mad at him for saying a slur he is allowed to reclaim. It’s also been said that Dream provided Nicolas with the alcohol at the time as well which is fucking WEIRD. Gave an underage person alcohol.
that nightmare song he performed is him foreshadowing his present sitch  😂
looks like an promotion to another channel -- I will slow pass this
indeed
We’re living in a time line where gumball and dream starting fighting on Twitter.  What a world we live in folks
At least Cry kept his mask on throughout getting in hot water lol
DREAM IS OVER PARTY!
HAPPY THANKSGIVING CHARLIEEE
Nicholas referring to himself as Michael Angelo is fucking wild
I wonder if the guy never face revealed, would this stuff have happened XD
Dream = BOZO
Charlie: A man moaning would be the worst jump scare ever  Charlie: Proceeds to do it immediately after 0-0
Dream is fuckin gross as is par for the course. Nick is fuckin losing it though and I hope he gets help since it definitely is a red flag for the mental health issues later mentioned. That clip of him in the car did definitely rub me the wrong way though just because of his attitude (accounting for/keeping in mind him being crossfaded of course - I just cannot handle being around drunk people like that especially if they get abusive or violent)  I’ve only ever experienced hypomamia so I can’t know what a full manic episode is like however so Im trying to not pass a ton of judgement onto him.
Womp womp, Dream is a Pedo, who wouldve guessed
Dream's always getting into some kind of batshit insane drama, I swear, I am never NOT hearing this guy doing something stupid or immoral.
Charlie, I didn't have to listen to the audio, but thank you, very useful info. Also, didn't dream basically admit to some of the allegations by something he stated in that tweet? Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
This is the greatest Thanksgiving drama of all time.
Yepp im convinced  None of you are ready for AI. CLEARLY.
Io is so cute <3
If it was a minor. It seems like the minor was distributing child 🌽
Dream is really going downhill
Minecraft and groomers, name a more iconic duo.
REMEMBER EHAT WE LEARNED FROM KWITE, INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY
I actually had no idea Dream was widely disliked on the Internet. It seemed at least to me he was a fairly well-liked. But granted I didn’t even know who he was until he did his face reveal.
for Thanksgiving i decided to watch this
Cringe and Happy Thanksgiving to all who reads this
After everything thats happened  You have to wonder:  Was dreams face reveal even worth it  Since after his face reveal: he's gone way downhill.  Maybe dream would've been better off keeping his face a secret.
"I'm sure you've all heard of X" I've literally never heard of anyone or anything you ever say that about
Honestly dream is a narcissist and eternally a child and he just needs to leave the Internet already and get some serious help I may not be a doctor but I can tell that dream has some mental health issues that's not being treated
Happy day of thanksgiving.
Poor Charlie is so innocent, he doesn't even know people send moaning videos all the time...
So uhhh, i guess this all makes Carson look better with his situation huh
Charlie and his sounds 🧐
I’m his tweet he called the moaning video “revenge porn” which validates for me that it was him in the video, but there’s still no proof that he was talking with a minor.
If only he never did a face reveal
Lol Dream had to only shut up and don’t tweet about drama and he would have been successful. But he’s an idiot so that’s that.
Being homeless on a holiday about food and family is tuff.
Happy Thanksgiving Charlie, love your channel
We need the dog in more videos... NOW
Didnt we stop associating with dream once he was found out to be cheating in his speed runs? Why is he even still a youtuber let alone a successful one
41 minutes and already 89 dislikes. Looks like Charlie pissed off the preschoolers in his audience.
Can your editor pitch down the screams ? It is very loud 😢
I didn't think charlie would be getting in to the dream situation until the video came out xD bc i figured he would have a HUGe amount of content from it
My problem w dream is he has shown himself to be a liar, what with the whole speed running, fake vlog bs from like 4 years ago, so i don't really trust anything he says. And also the fact that loads of his friends have stooped interacting with him sorta confirms that hes a bad person anyway. He might not be a pedo but there's a reason why his inner circle of friends has dwindled so significantly, and if his old friends want nothing to do with him, neither do i
Sharkboy was right when he said, “Hit the hay fast a sleep. Dream a dream you little bleep. Dream, dream, dream.”
6:06 Oh my man Charlie, yes thats a thing and for me is as awful as you think 😅 I tried that once because she did first, but that's it, once was enough to say that sending this kind of audio isn't my thing 😂
Since someone already wished Charlie and his cat a happy Thanksgiving, I wish Tiana and his dogs a happy Thanksgiving
are we gonna talk about charlie moaning
iO is finally taking a stand against Charlie removing her cat tree from camera view, go queen
Dream would be 1 tbf, (a pdfile) i say he is until proven otherwise
Who?
"nobody cared who I sexted until I put the mask back on"
dream went for cryaotic's brand so hard he even became a groomer
we got dream vs gumball before gta6 also i can smell a new meatcanyon video cooking up
I can already imagine this as like an adultswim short where gumball is.grown up and living in a run down apartment and dream is his upstairs neighbor who keeps making racket
Seeing kitty grow is why I  subbed
6:19 For a brief moment, we witness Charlie summoning the spirit of a man with a normal vocal tone
Can you imagine being that Uber driver and having the Gumball VA drunkenly argue with Dream in the back
Taking a massive dump it burns 😔
Just because he plays Minecraft doesn’t mean he likes miners 💀💀💀
Gumball didn’t stutter once, he destroyed Dream
Im literally an idiot abd i can usually follow this stuff. This i still dont know what the hooplah is even after this video....
When a Dream becomes a Nightmare
That's what the mask for😏😏😏
At least Pyrocynical beat you to the punch when covering Dream.
gumball dunking on dream is one of my favorite things seen this year
One thing left out is that he said the moaning videos are revenge porn so he admitted they’re real.
Dream has always been a dweeb ngl. His face fits his personality perfectly.
he has responded to these recent allegations on his private twitter, it’s frustrating how poorly he handles them when he could’ve just handled it like Kwite if he was really all that innocent.  Dream has literally confirmed in his private response that all of the evidence is true, and nobody in the general public will realize this and deem this case “alleged” simply because of how easily he’s able to hide it. out of all the allegations, this one is not only the most horrifying, but also the most legitimate, and it’s wrongfully being treated like petty drama. i promise you all dream’s face reveal is NOT the reason he is this hated.   he is not a good person you should be coddling, he is a creepy narcissist who has been able to get away with lying whilst preying on his teenage fanbase. he is not this “normal guy who’s trying to get by,” there are ex dream fans who can literally account for this, and the only reason YOU don’t know about it is because YOU simply weren’t that big of a fan/weren’t obsessed enough with this creator to notice. dream has purposefully operated this way. stop downplaying this situation
Both Gumball and Dream are garbage human beings. Being intoxicated and high is no excuse for behaving like a fucken knuckle dragger.
Would not be surprised if dreams making AT LEAST SOME of the accounts spouting outlandish accusations to muddy the waters and make it harder to figure out what actually happened
I was waiting for charlie to cover this lesgooo
Charlie copying Pyro as per usual 🙄💀😫
I'm just gonna say it. I'm not a dream fan anymore.
I heard of this and I just thought "I don't need to look into this, moist will make a video on this." And my prediction came true
love your videos and happy thanksgiving everyone.
dream got fucked up by gumball thats foul 😭
I don't really get why Dream is so hated. I've been following him for years and I have never came across him doing weird shit. All these allegations with no proof, and if these were true why wouldn't anyone take it to the court? It's just a bunch of nonsense and I get really sad to see all the bullying.
Happy thanksgiving papa moisttttt 🤭
Io was the best part of this video, shes such a gorgeous cat. Happy thanksgiving Charlie and family! 🩷
I like dreams verses videos idk why he stopped it’s like eh took the bag and left
4:00 for anyone waiting to see Charlie with his shirt off
hearing dream moan on twitter was the worst day ever
I prommised my self to staw awayfrom ypurube drama or Dream stuff, but its a holiday, time for a little treat
who tf is watching dream thirst traps
Are you going back in time to get turkeys off the menu to?
პინგვინზ0 კიდევ ერთხელ ფაქტებს ბაზრობს 💪💪💪
Dream should’ve never gotten as famous as he did in the first place. He will for sure go down as a cautionary tale of what happens to people who become famous really quickly and gain a rabid fanbase.
Do you think he's gonna pull out the note blocks in the apology video?
Dream did the face reveal and I had a feeling he was a pedo 😂
ok
Happy thanksgiving, thankful for all the content you put out. Have a good day today!
the moaning is insane
Dream did basically confirm that it is him in those videos in a priv tweet. He said he was "intimate" with someone above age a while ago and that's where the audio is from. Not sure how true that is bc he didn't provide the most concrete proof either (that it was from someone above age). The thing that bothers me is that hes had these kind of allegations before (for over a year now with multiple other people) and he has said multiple times in the past that he's going to make a video and address the allegations. And all he does is make a private tweet about how everything is false and then moves along. But as soon as the whole Cantu thing happens he releases the video in like a day over some petty internet drama. Like if he really did care, why not just release at least one thing to prove your innocence while the video is being made? This past year hes had the time to start a "music" career but can't even release any sort of proof it wasn't him? insane
Ever since I have heard about this have been getting a lot of mixed signals but I strongly believe that dream is a narcissist and a hypocrite but for now we just have to wait for creditable evidence and from reliable sources
It's disheartening to witness people's readiness to express unproven statements, using serious damaging words they don't comprehend. For instance, casually using terms like 'p-dophilia,' a clinical term, without grasping its actual meaning. I actually feel compelled to educate those who misunderstand, given that I'm a survivor of real s-xual assault. I understand firsthand what actual p-dophilia entails via predatory behavior.  Even if 'Dream' were found guilty, he wouldn't fit the description of a 'gr--mer,' as there's no significant age difference and it would require proven manipulation over many years from a young age.   It's important to note that 'p-dophile' is a clinical term strictly used to diagnose individuals with a very rare disorder, as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). It characterizes a primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children, generally aged 13 years or younger—excluding mature individuals in their adolescence (older than 13) as it focuses on the attraction to prepubescent physical maturity.  Consequently, unless if someone who's 16 or older is involved with someone (or just likes someone) who's 13 or younger, then they can't be labelled as anything other than a normal functioning person. And unless if the person you're dating or like, who happens to be 16 or 17 (while you're a legal adult) also has some weird disorder that enabled them to unfortunately be stuck with the prepubescent physical maturity of a child, you still can't be diagnosed with p-dophilia despite the differing opinions of others with the age difference.  Hence, if 'Dream' really attempted to date someone who's 16 or 17, calling it creepy or uncomfortable is understandable to some, sure, but it wouldn't fit the criteria for p-dophilia unless these individuals appeared 13 or younger. That's the reality. And I know there's going to be that one goofy braindead parasocial harpy with the attention span of a donkey hair follicle who thinks that I'm trying to sympathize with actual predators, gr--mers, or s-xual assaulters so I'm just going to shut that down real quick.   This whole thing is about being as responsible as possible and avoiding mischaracterizing others with clinical terms or words one doesn't comprehend. These words have the potential to damage lives and reputations forever, especially when one lacks any irrefutable evidence of guilt. I'm tired of this 'guilty by association' mindset and the lack of concrete proof before making judgments on platforms like Twitter. It's both sickening and pathetic. It actually pisses me off. I'm not even a fan of 'Dream'. I think he's a cringe lord who probably spends too much time on the internet. Look at his corny cringe worthy TikToks and Snapchat stories. But it doesn't mean I'm going to just crucify him because people made claims.  I always found it weird how people online find it easy to feel hate for people they don't know and how they enjoy jumping on bandwagons as soon as there is one. It's also always guilty by trial, judge and jury without there being any real proof, on Twitter. I think that's just horrible and worrying. Can people really be this uncivilized? I know there's alleged screenshots and everything but if anyone used their brains, they'd leave it up to proper authorities to do any investigations. They'd hear the accused' story. In a civil world, people are understanding. This whole 'let's dunk on Dream' situation makes me lose hope for the future generations of this world after I'm long gone. I shouldn't be f-cking surprised. People drag MrBeast for doing good around the world, calling him evil and everything.  I'm disappointed in those using the internet to behave like this. There really isn't any hope for this world anymore. There's more wars now going on in the world just in the nick of time. Perhaps it's really about to come to an end. 🤦‍♂️
If it turns out true then nobody will be suprised
noice
Ace Ventura over here
dam his cat is turning into a tiger
This situation reminds me of what happened to Scott from fnaf.
gumboil va averse W
🗣 I CANT BREED WHEN YOU NUT THERE    ❗❗
Charlie finally made a video on this subject so now all the 12 years can STFU about it.
Dream moaning = Tim the tool man uwaaaaauuuuuoooo sound effect
The absolute fascination the internet has had for the past few years of trying to destroy online creators by making up the most unhinged accusations is something I'll never understand. I remember a decade back when you had to really do some horrible shit and be very stupid about it for it to blow up in your face. Nowadays, it's like every creator and their mom is getting accused of various crimes every other week because people are addictied to drama or just plain want to destroy people's lives when they're more successful than them...
Dream starting more drama just to see internet mock him almost feels like he has humiliation kink
The dream moaning point is a bit off only because dream HAS confined it, tho claimed it's wasn't to a minor. Only issues i'm having
Honestly, even if I could be 100% convinced that Dream is innocent of the allegations (which I'm not convinced of; dude is weird af with his fans and his denials have all seemed sus), I would still want him to get off the internet entirely. Not because I believe he is some irredeemable dangerous person, but because I've watched him deteriorate in real time. People are always on his ass - sometimes for petty reasons, sometimes for very real concerns - and his responses always make things worse. He's doing nothing but hurting himself and dragging other people down with him.   He's got a mansion, loads of money, and two best friends living with him. He doesn't need online publicity. In fact, he would probably be happier without it.
The fact that Dream had proof and instead being hated back is proof that no one likes him, at all.
6:19 You know that's getting clipped what were you thinking! 😂
Dream is pretty much going to become modern Onision.
we know people love hatting on dreams so enjoy the interwebs lol
Dudes really starting to feel like a Micheal Jackson of his time
Dream kept the Nic video for about a year TO SPECIFICALLY USE when dream got in hot water so he could divert attention to somebody else if something came out about him
Here’s a quick fact: the word “faggot” is not a slur
Ever since that niggas face reveal errything been going downhill 😂😂
I can't believe Gumball is in this mess
Remember when dream used to just do Minecraft speed runs😔
Crazy to think that literally all this started simply from him revealing his face
him calling the audio video "revenge p*rn" is proof that it is indeed him imo.
I don't like Dream as much as the next guy, I find him annoying and weird. But I haven't seen one thing that proves he's an actual kid diddler. The snapchat thing is a whole lot of nothing because it could be so easily faked, it doesn't even sound like the guy. Cantu is about as insufferable as Dream, but since the internet just hates one dude much more they just pat him in the back.
Uploaded 30 minutes after the pyro vid and already has more views Charlie low-key doing a bit of trolling :^)
I have done far too much digging on this subject and I think I should just touch grass instead and delete twitter ( and honestly dream should do that too)
We know from the very well documented, initially denied then admitted cheating scandal, that Dream's fans are totally crazy. Nuts. Cuckoo. Point is, they will totally run interference for him, no matter what.
Weehee
Twitter needs to get deleted
5 min gang!!
6:00 you'd be so unbelievably surprised
2:30 I have to agree with you. The "evidence" provided is pretty sketchy imo. I've also noticed that when people run out of comebacks, they resort to the 4 letter word to get back at people.    Later down the road you might be making videos on deepfakes used as "proof" against people. Definitely not looking forward to that... 😬
Just another Minecraft deep tuber.
5:58  It might seem crazy what im bout to say Charlie😅
"You've got it from here." WHYYYYYY
See ya
LMFAOAOAOAOAOAOAOAO CHARLIE
4:12 he admitted that it was him, but says that it's wasn't sent to anyone underage, but instead to an ex and that it’s revenge p*rn
6:18 holy for a second i really thought he was finishing.. great acting charlie though that makes me question why you werent put in the lord of the rings
6:20 i can already sense the no context moist videos on tiktok
dream is just a nightmare
Dream admitted that the moaning videos were real, he's trying to say that it's revenge p though
happy gobble day i love you bro
I called this shit, I saw everything going on and I was like "Charlie is for sure gonna make a video" 3 days later, let's goooo
Knocked his block off
5:10 nice i had it on without earpods in the kitchen, very helpfull since last time this happened was charlies "jump scare"
There is only one human being who has been horny enough to communicate their desire via random moaning, and that man was Prince!
Im so baffled at how fast I found out before charlie made a video
A Childrens youtuber being a creep, wow, shocker.  Perhaps from now on we need to start keeping an eye on people who make content for kids a bit closer.
I can't believe Charlie is copying Pyrocynical once again!!
Glad I wasn’t into the whole dream and that Minecraft stuff. People or just adults making kids content is already creepy
At this point, honestly I wouldn't be astronomically surprised that dream groomed children. But the gumball shit is innumerable times more confusing to be honest. Good thing we got one one of one of youtube’s most trustable source ever to cover the subject heh
You guys realize both gumball and dream are like around the same age,dream is only 4 years older.But it’s sucks knowing the voice actor who helped make my childhood had to be such an asshole,I mean I already know dreams a weirdo,but why’d Nicholas also have to be an asshole?
Welp, that's a Dream Moment right there
everyone out here just rapin
Whoever sees this, Happy Thanksgiving to everyone reading this!
I used to play Minecraft with this man years ago ahaha
“I feel more confused than a caveman seeing fire for the first time.”  That's how I feel every day 💀
What can anyone possibly do to dream that the internet would take dream's side nowadays? Like jeez how do you take an L this hard against the voice of bloody gumball
Man, that's crazy, happy Thanksgiving.
Can't believe pyro was faster than Charlie this time and now he steals his vid title . Wow.
Cat vs predator
Dream Jokes aren't gonna Age well....
Horrible dream situation  Huge dream drama The dream situation gets worse The dream situation is horrible  Massive YouTuber drama
He’s very very creepy and also queerbaited a bunch, there was a whole thing about a dream smp fanfiction and it’s pretty evident he read it which is yuckie
Wheres the astrophysics man to write a paper on if dream is a predator
Now I fully understand the gumball memes I've been seeing in the past week
so who is this dream kid again ?  if he did pedo shit hes a fucking pedo no point of arguing about that  case solved
Dream being a Pedophile I wouldn't be surprised😅
Happy Thanksgiving Charlie
Let's be honest, people wouldn't be nearly this forgiving of the actor if he did this to somebody that wasn't Dream. I find Dream extremely cringe and annoying, but I have yet to see valid evidence to support the grooming allegations.
Don't even gotta make food, Nickolas already cooked
The entirety of facts I know about dream can now be summarized as:  the moaning cheater with the face
Comparing Charlie’s view of Dream to the last video he made on him 2 years ago really shows how far Dream has fallen  If the claims are false, Dream needs to take a long break from the internet, delete his Twitter account and get a therapist. His ego and impulsivity will be the death of his career. I feel like the creepy stuff like the thirst traps and engaging with fans probably isn’t even him intentionally being creepy, but moreso him just being a shit celebrity who doesn’t know how to interact with his fans like a normal human being  It’s been genuinely sad watching him fall, and I hope he takes time away from the internet to learn from his fuck ups. IF he’s innocent
Dream once kicked my dog.
This thanksgiving I’m thankful for Gumball. If anyone wants to see him talking on a stage about himself, check out the Kill Tony podcast episode with Kam Patterson and Uncle Jolly.
CAT!
6:19 another great, out of context, Charlie meme for us all to feast on 💀💀
But Dream confirmed the moaning. He said it was revenge porn lmaoooo You gotta do better than that Charlie. The information was there
Charlie is my favourite internet detective
Can someone explain to me why does dream post thirst traps to he's 10-13 year old fans???
This is probably the only chance we’ll ever get to cancel dream so please don’t fumble this twitter 🙏🏽  Been a hater since day 1 Edit: WELL WELL WELL LOOKS LIKE I WAS RIGHT
With the audio in his Twitter post, addressing this, he essentially indirectly, admitted to sending it to a minor
Happy thanksgiving boys
I think the unifying element is everyone being like "yea I could see Dream doing that shit" which isn't great for him
He should just sing "Toxic Gossip Train" for his response
Charlie people will do ANYTHING will horny fog, Probably not dream tho.
How is dream a narcissist? He like, hates his own face and hid it for years? I dont know his content well though, but that doesn't seem narcissistic to me?
Damn that cat is extra fluffy
I didn’t open twitter for 2 days and I see gumball beefing with dream
There’re both Overrated mooks😒
Bro why's it always the Minecraft youtubers?
The worst thing about the ped situation is that his stans will still pamper and baby him saying that he did nothing wrong.
*T O X I C  G O S S I P  T R A I N*
Dream is about to have an IRL manhunt soon 😂😂
Dream did confirm himself that the moaning was him
C-dog always got a ridic'y amount of likeys in an under hour. Totes on the Impressy ma man! Happy tur-day too!
Bro finally made a video about it
No way this is how I lean what Shane Dawson did. Just no way.
Gumball being based again but this time irl
Charlie, how do you make all your videos so entertaining, i love your videos and cant stop watching them. Keep it up please
as someone with npd, please do not lump us in with dream oh my god
As a history major, I think our forebears would like this celebration of Thanksgiving more than the current ond
Bro should’ve kept the mask on 💀.
Hate to break it to you Charlie, but sand isn’t actually real.
The problem with Dream grooming allegations its how his stans have delivered so many lies and make false acussations to make the real allegations seem fake
Haven't heard that name in a whike
I'm sorry "classic meme of the guy passing a kidny stone while coming"!?
You're talking to a Michelangelo.  Lol I don't care much about either party but that guy sounds like a tool.
Who tf cares about dream's life??  Him and gumball, fight to the death, that i would care about, other than that this was a waste of your time Charlie.
happy thanksgiving pilgrims im john wayne
tbh i'm definitely biased towards believing it bc dream has said some absolutely wild stuff about minors in public. he told a sixteen year old colleague who was uncomfortable with basically being flirted at that it was ok bc he was legal in the uk and he made a joke about a thirteen year old on his server sleeping with a grown man. none of that is a crime just weird but it makes me totally believe he'd be weird to other teenagers.
im not righteous at all idc that someone said f slur i just thinks its funny that gumball has comebacks and dream doesn't know how to respond in a funny way, its all entertainment for me
i cant wait for dream to be an onision level lolcow in 5 years
Oh wow a Minecraft YouTuber being a Pedo shocker
time to put meat in my mouth this thanksgiving
currently eating 4 beer brautwurst  and a full bag of kettles sea salt and vinegar chips. Happy thanksgiving everyone.
Imma say gumball is a narsissist when hes drunk and its not an excuse but dream is a pedo so... Id rather side with a drunken narsissist than a kiddie diddler
Cum
look all i know is i hate dream, and gumball waterson (openly queer) responding to "i have adhd yknow" by making fun of his stupid mask song and calling him the f slur is incredibly funny
I'm devestated you didn't include the quote "Hire a harvard professor to figure out how you dmed every streamer in Austin and got no reply" or smth like that
I am thankful for Charlie uploading
Charlies titles are crazy
"manic episode" a convenient way for the dream haters to try and throw him under the bus. Cantu is a narcissistic terrible human and the only reason he's not being largely called out on it is because people hate dream that much. This whole situation makes me hate the internet just that little bit more. People on twitter lack the ability to be fair, be objective, be rational or non-biased.   Note: I don't like dream, I don't really care for his content either. I see this all from the outside looking in.
this is one of the dream moments of all time
Crazy how 2 years ago dream was the biggest creator of all time and now everyone talks crap about him. Smh
This is crazy to think about tbh.
Happy Thanksgiving yall😊
I don't believe allegations until somebody reports to the cops and they decide to charge. I don't engage in cancel culture until people go to the cops and the cops charge.
​
Your hair looks very nice today charlie
FYI on the moaning videos dream have admitted that they are real but that they weren't being sent to a kid (he also called it revenge porn lmfao)
Dream isn't a groomer
I was waiting for your talk on this 😭
Content creators these days are getting out of control 🤦
What baffles me is that there are people that think sending voice memos of them moaning is sexy😅
Out of all that has happened this year, Gumball vs Dream is one of the most unexpected.
Ah thank you Charlie, Dream moaning is what I wanted to hear today on this Thanksgiving
I am thankful for someone: (you) taking one for the team and sorting out twitter so we didn't have to
Dream needs to remove X and get to touch grass
Can't wait for 6:19 to be clipped and turned into a meme
Another popular Roblox YouTuber  with 1M+ subscribers is also accused of grooming,
Popular Creator/Celebrity Don't Groom a Minot Challenge - IMPOSSIBLE
Yes
Happy Thanksgiving pilgrims ❤️✌️🍻
Guys sending the moaning thing is real, though I've only experienced it because I asked for it from someone I couldn't be with physically at that moment.
SUPAH MARIO WAHOOOO
charlie just reading and recreating the moans makes me moist.
honestly nics monologue went so hard
31m
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS CHARLIE VIDEO LETS GOOOO 😂
Didn’t Dream himself confirm the videos were real.
bro, as a 22yo person who used to watch him for comfort since quarantine, i have no fucking idea what's real anymore. i wouldn't call myself a stan anymore, but there is still some sympathy in me towards him - HOWEVER, if the allegations are true, that's just devastating, but i guess i wouldn't be the first person to be disappointed by the content creator that they like.  on the other side, twitter is a toxic place (shocking) and i do think he shouldn't respond the way he did. there'll be always someone who wants to get you in some way or another, who wants you to fail and it's your job to learn how to react to those type of situations, especially since it's not the first time it happened and it's really hard to tell if he's lying or if the claims are fake. you can't change that there's so much hate, but you can call out people on their wrongdoings in a human way. i don't think we're in the "human way" of handling things now. this is just a shit-show. he definitely shouldn't feed the hate the way he already did, but oh god, it's just terrifying to watch even from afar.
so many insta reels clips piling up
Yoo really how did they find him anyways
charlie is constantly blessing us with prime clip and soundboard potential
Who shot Johnny Joestar?
Btw Dream himself confirmed he was indeed the guy in the moaning videos on his alt Twitter of all fucking things
164,075
Dang i don't want to know, just gonna remember manhunts as a fun vid series and ignore anthing that happened outside of those
I heard one second of that moaning video and i never want to hear anything again
Dream revealing his face was were his downfall began
Dream. Truly the content creator of all time
Someone: "I think dream is ok."  Dream: **writes an entire fucking novel on why he's not just 'okay'**
Holy sh!t .... nogla was right
Dream is fackt
6:18 he sounds like he's laying on the sidewalk after getting drugged and getting the shit beaten out of him
I mean, even if it was Dream, both of them appear to be absolute degenerates. I see a lot of people loving one of 'em because they voiced a children's cartoon, but that don't mean crap. Pick your heroes wisely guys.
Ooooohh golly
My power went out so no Thanksgiving
The only YouTuber that actually cares about his  Subscribers❤
why every minecraft youtuber comes out as a pedo lmao
its so sad because even if these so called influencers get outed more than once theres always that one idiot/creep out there in this world who will still go and give them a platform. Like James Charles and miranda singa and all those people who have been outed.   Truly shows how people don’t really give a flying fuck and its truly sickening. They’ll only pretend they do
who else ate too much gravy god damn
Both of them are clowns and gumballs a cokehead now💀
well some people dont realize, while theyre insulting nicholas cantu that hes both pansexual and neurodivergent, the slurs he said, he can still reclaim he didnt say anything he cant or anything and its weird ive seen people talk about it without this knowledge despite it being fairly well known
LOL
Dream try not to get in drama every week (impossible)
I love how im getting these brain rot videos as if theyre expecting me to care, how the fuck do I get rid of this shit from my reccomended
I love how before Charlie has stated that alcohol & being bipolar is never a excuse to do shiity behavior , and now everyone’s letting everything nick said go under the rug 💀
Hail the 199
Dream taking off the mask was the cataclysm for all of this.
Dream has always been a shitty person. hence why he has been shat on for YEARS since 2020 (WITH A LOT OF EVIDENCE) so this news isn't new.
Yeahh.. i mean he is a kids game "content creator" so the accusations sound about right.. i mean even look at the dude, he has a face fit to groom children.
why is it always the minecrafters
Could've made an AI generated voice at least, would've been more believable
I came from my Xbox too my phone just too say girls these days like moaning sound clips so realistically whoever that was could know that and thought "hey I'd shoot my shot" but then also added cringe text with it has well🤣🤣
Nicholas Cantu was on Kill Tony a month ago(Kam Patterson episode), bombed and was really weird on stage. Also said he was 21 for some reason
omfg
As much as I don't like Dream, it's pretty cringe how a lot of people are just willing to believe any and all allegations against him with little to no evidence just because they don't like him. I think the attitude of "I don't like him, so he can't do anything right" is just as delusional as "I love him, so he can't do anything wrong." They're just two sides of the same parasocial coin. As always, good on Charlie for actively seeking out evidence one way or the other instead of jumping on a bandwagon of stupidity.
Happy Thanksgiving, Charlie. 🤘🏻
Literally never saw a video of this dude! I only know him because people on twitter said he is ugly after his face reveal wich is kinda funny that's literally the only thing i know about him! :D
I'm pretty sure dream admitted to that moan clip
This is why snapchat needs to be banned
THATS WHAT THE MASK IS
Takes him months of constantly getting accused while putting nothing out about it but also making constant non statements on it, the guy should've kept his mouth shut, it ironically would've worked out better. Maybe he should get his physicist on the case.
The name of his album really annoyed me, it was something like "erm, have a listen to this, if you feel like it, I guess" or something beta like that. come on dude
"Hire a Harvard professor to calculate why despite texting every twitch streamer in Austin nobody wanted to f*k you" - Gumball really pulverised Dream . 😂
Im thankful Gumball slapped the hell out of Dream
Dream likes 2 types of Miners.
Congrats to Dahvie Vanity on now being the 2nd most-hated celebrity to graduate from my old high school (never met him or Dream, my high school experience was sandwiched between theirs in the early 2010s)
Dog reverse jumpscare
even if dream isn't a pedo, which I think he probably is, he still seems like an absolutely terrible and reprehensible person
Dream, thinking he’s unstoppable, undefeatable: Gumball Fucking Waterson, prepared to end this man’s whole career: *prepares knife*
6:19 moistmoaning.mp3
When I first heard the moan audio, I didn't think it was Dream. I've heard his voice and to me it just doesn't sound like him. Of course, I haven't heard him moan, but the audio doesn't sound convincing enough to me. Again, it very well COULD be him, I'm not sure, but at least right now, it seems like it's someone else
Dream stans are really going to hate this
Dream is mid. Next story.
Ever since he revealed his face, everyone has been searching for ways to bully him or bring him down, defamating and hating on him. If the claims of him being a weird guy are confirmed true, i will agree with yall, but right now you guys are being straight evil against him.  But i guess you dont care unless something tragic happens
What’s even worse is the fact that people are celebrating Dream being accused which just shows that they don’t care about the actual grooming but wants a valid reason to hate on the internet figure they’ve been obsessively hating on for the last 2 years
People like this have minds that never grow past the age of 15
I hope you have a great Thanksgiving Charlie.
The slur Nicolas said shouldn't really upset people considering the fact that Nicolas is part of the LGBTQ+ so him saying the F slur is a stretch.
Charlie randomly attempting to make whimpering noises is extremely funny to me.
4:08 dream actually confirmed on his private twitter that the videos are his
i really don’t think Dream is the type of person to be a pedo. i think it’s just a bunch of kids wanting attention and Dream haters wanting to ruin his life.
6:14, Charlie clearly was not an impressionable horny minor with a Kik clearly haha. (It’s an embarrassing time for some of us)
Hasnt charlie met dream or something
He finally covered it
Dream should stay off Twitter
I love it when Charlie's pets pop up in a video
something about this situation is eerily similar to the cryaotic situation, the smiley mask, the grooming and inappropriate conversations with minors, them being rlly big on youtube before their downfall... its super weird
How tf does he get into so much trouble
You  make me so very thankful Charley!!!!. I hope you have a wonderful day!!!!!
Three Charlie moaning, audio?
Whenever charlie talks about dating stuff it is so clear he has never dated anyone but his girl he has no expeience flirting lmao
6:19 im clipping that
I've always have thought that most of dream allegations and the hate he receives is fake and too much, but i really can't say that on the internet cause everyone will think that I'm a stan at least. I used to be a fan of him, when he started, he's so cringe now but i still believe he doesn't deserve ALL that hate. And still, i love the video of him with gumball
6:19 is one for the history books
where did tetra go??????
5:10 LMAO
Happy Turkey day!!  Dream got fucked. 😂
I like to put into notice that dream admitted to some of these claims
WHOOPY DREAM IS GOING DOWN. always looked like a registered offender
Common Dream L
What happened with Shane Dawson and his cat ?!
Pyro called it
Dream sending moaning videos to minors, and claiming that it’s bad on THEM and calling that “revenge porn” is what I expected from the weird ass crimson chin Minecraft YouTuber, the moron 😂🤦🏼
I feel bad for dream. Assuming the allegations are fake. But the whole gumball thing is uncalled for though.
Dream is finally quitting twitter after gumball smacked dream’s face
Charlie clearly doesn’t know the popularity of male whimpering audio
Can someone explain what he actually did before the recent accusations and why so many are hating on him? I don't know much about dream except that he's a famous youtuber so I'm genuinely curious
Pyro uploaded first!!
Good day to everyone!
As long as things are bad for dream I’m happy
Best thing about this situation is that thanks to it we get a clip of charlie moaning 6:20-6:25.
It’s funny cause dream didn’t do nun bro just got mad 💀🙏
5:10-5:12 Ayo that's some DBZ type shit Charlie 😭😭😭
Heard Dreams name tho dont know anything about him... Wasnt he the dude who cheated in minecraft?! P.s. Now people will use charlies moaning to try and cancel him 😅😂
Dream admitted to the moan’s being him
Charles, me boy. Love the vids, but did we really have to listen to a moaning video? I would have taken it at your word.
Who is Dream anyway? Besides that random meme face, what does he even do!? 😅
i always hated dream because of everyone freaking out about him. i always also felt a little weird about him and i guess other do too or know he is.
6:19 is gonna be clipped
Mine crafters are mostly nonces
Here before this clip gets taken out of context: 6:18
Bro said Jimminy Christmas and reminded me of my late grandfather… hope you’re doing alright, wherever your atoms went and whatever they’re going to create, jingobell!
It may be Thanksgiving but Charlie is the one who ate
Ayo pyro beat charlie to it, and not moment too soon LET'S GO!!!!!
So it all boils down to him being the male version of Bellinger. YouTube can be a great place to give deserving people a platform but then you have creeps like them who ruins it for all.
dream never disappoints when it comes to disappointing
The dream controversy is the only thing more confusing than fnaf lore
dream addmited to the moaning audios being him btw, but he claimed they were sent to somebody named Nat that he had a brief thing with, but then this Nat person denied those ever being sent to her.
fun fact to everyone here, CANTU WASN'T DRUNK! CANTU WAS COMPLETELY SOBER DURING THAT ENCOUNTER
how does bro take over a year to supposedly find evidence that he wasnt being horny for children (still none provied) but take 20 seconds to find blackmail on someone who was mentally unstable
I wonder if Charlie will talk about the Josh Giddey situation
Happy thanksgiving Charlie!
I’m so glad you made a video on this 😭
Happy Thanksgiving to my American neighbours.
Do Josh giddy next
Gumball has been a piece of sh** with the uber who had nothing to do with the beef, lied avout rewarding him, assaulted and threatened a man, but ig he is right doing so because the other guy has some  unconfirmed allegations against him
I don’t watch Charlie live, so I didn’t realize how big his kitten is now!
time to consume this large bird
"Terminally horny." Hahahaha
the way that if dream was fine none of this would’ve happened😭
Out of everything Charlie has told me I'm more shocked about the guy cumming and passing the kidney stone at the same time
Please make a video about the globar meat scandal 🙏🙏🙏
Kitty cat 😺 Meow  good boy 👋
Close your eyes while you watch this video.
*Take a break champ, its Thanksgiving.* Don't need to upload all the time.
‘Oh wow, my Minecraft channel is really doing well! I could make a career out of thi-‘  ‘I groomed a minor.’
dream is just goofy
Ayooo I was so caught off guard when the moan clip played bc I was wearing headphones and was occupied w something else and I almost melted out of cringe
he should just quit the Internet bruh
Dream deserved it, but I can't exactly side with Gumball guy. Man's absolute ruined his career after the fight. Man's basically thinks he's Jesus's incarnate, and that EVERYONE is beneath him. If you don't believe me, search "gumball voice actor rant"
Edp sends poop and you’re surprised someone would send a video of them moaning 😂
never get cross faded near an enemy
letsplay youtuber try not to be a peado challenge (IMPOSSIBLE)
It's almost as if your know your not supposed to engage in your community if you know it mostly consists of children. Dream seems to be taking the boogie route too with being to active on Twitter too.
No matter whose side your on, you must agree that dream should not post a video to all of his fans. it will just place more attention on him. He did it before with the speedrun cheat debunk, and it just added to the drama.
This year I’m thankful for the times I’ve had, the family that’s here, and the downfall of dream. Happy thanksgiving chuck and to everyone else
I'm thankful that I live in a world where gumball beat up dream
I was taking a bite out of my food when that groaning happened. How my family probably thinks I’m disgusting on thanksgiving 👉🙂💨
bro will look into dream allegations, but if andrew tate gets accused of something bro will automatically believe it
Dream?! The guy who cheated on Minecraft a kids game and then tried to defend himself 🤮🤮🤮
Happy thanksgiving
i wish everyone as a society could come together and just shun dream out of existence, it's annoying hearing about him all the time
Dream: “I’m beggin, beggin UuUUuu” Finish the lyrics
I love the fact that all Dream does is play Minecraft in a slightly different way than others yet everyone cyberbullies him💀
I'm far from being a Dream supporter but the Snapchat "evidence" really seemed sus to me, the moaning doesn't even really sound like Dream. I feel like everyone just jumped to believing it because Dream is a weirdo. Glad Charlie agreed with what I've been thinking
I was waiting for Charlie to drop this video ahahaha
To be honest most YouTubers are narcissists
Happy thanksgiving charlie! Im in the hospital this year so missing it unfortunately. Hope you all are doing well!
Dream realy is a dream come true for content creators. His rise, his reveal, his controversies, his fall and probably soon his arrest.
Moaning videos are pretty common. My GF used to send them to me when we started dating. Sounds just like Freddy Fazbear and I’m so into that. Just thinking about it again gets me goin.
Your title is almost identical to Pyrocynical's on the same topic! You say 'crazy' he says 'insane'. This time his video appeared in my notifications 30 mins before yours! You copyist . LOL
people faking this shit are the worst POS. even if dream was doing this, by faking allegations it makes it harder for real people to be believed. just pure evil all around.
someone needs to take away dreams access to the internet, they would be doing Dream and everyone else a huge favor. bro needs to learn when to just stfu. even if nothing thats come out recently about him is true (though im rather inclined to believe it is) there is no reason why he should be on twitter responding to every single nobody who even speaks about him in a way that isn't stroking his ego.
How are content creators so confident they can be fucking weirdos and get away with it? When I was younger I was too scared to even sext girls because I thought they would show their friends and nobody even cared about me. If I had a following I would be watching porn on a laptop I bought on craigslist using a vpn or some shit lmao.
my family is so disconnected i didnt even realize it was thanks giving or its me idk but yeah didnt even realize it was thanks giving
Didn’t he delete his face because hes a pedo and got caught with actual proof a long time ago
"Evidence"
What the        Good vid!
If its things with kids hes safe havent ya heard news usa is Pedo Capital of world so long as youre famous/semi rich you csnr be charged for stuff with kids anymore hell 8yr olds are being taught how to give O/A from trannys and drag queens.
Great video bro
The sending of a clip moaning is a thing that happens. Me and a friend had this gay French teacher. One day said teacher sent my friend an audio of him masturbating. He tried to get me into his house multiple times too.
Where can I find the Dream moaning video? ... I'm asking for a friend 🙈
Dream is hated so much, to the point I'm believing people are just making the situation messy and unclear for the general internet.
I sure love the one time of year where I see my least favorite cousins and overindulge until I shit my brains out. Guess where I am right now?
6:25 “you feeling it now babe” 😭😭💀
Happy Thanksgiving Charlie!
I liked the part when Charlie went “æügh".
Damn charlie, you really need to step up your moan game.
Charlie is such a hypocrite. You think he doesn't know every time he posts a video in a tank top, he sends thousands of tweens into early onset puberty?
so the best part about the dream vs gumball video, is apparently dream didn't even take the video?? he kept changing his story that he "got the video from someone else"
He shoulda kept the mask on
the way i yanked my earbuds out when the moaning started, i do not need to hear that on this wednesday afternoon
dream getting absolutely ruined by gumball is all I'm thankful for
Gumball just being gumball: Dream:it might seem cazy what im about to say
Some people need to get a life
At first I felt bad for Dream because  there’s all these people on Twitter potentially making fake allegations over very serious things but then I remember he basically cultivated an army of feral children who idolized him and didn’t bother to correct their behaviour.. so it seems somewhat fitting for them to turn on him like this
Ah the "Peter Pan Effect" 🙄. Gross
Charles "Jesus" White has blessed us all by stepping into the octagon again
i got a add from you for opera mid video
Who is that and why should I care
1:10 Charlie im sorry to break this to you, but you have become chronically online. Dont
5:10 charlie would be perfect for voice acting link
🎉
This world is fucking weird.
oh boy i hope dream does not hire another astrophysicist for this one
Dream did claim that it was revenge P therefore implying that it was real and he did send it
dream admitted that snap is his lmao bro dream need stop
So not puppy coded 😔 definitely do not wanna tattoo these moments on my body and brain 😖
another prime video for "out of context" clips
YO THE FACT YOU PUT THE MOANING IN THE VIDEO😂😂😂😂
happy thankgiving to everyone but dream
“No one cared who I was until I put on the mask” or took off the mask in this case.  Seems like everything bad in the world this year originated from his face reveal 😂
Charlie has more drama than a daytime soap
Dream is gonna be the thanksgiving turkey this year
Dream trying to cancel a pansexual for saying the f-slur is pure comedy, if anyone didn't think he was a shithead before lmfao
Charlie saying crossfaded was a highlight in this video
Dream just seems quite immature with a lot of this stuff. For a dude in his mid twenties he still acts like everything is highschool drama
Literally don't give a fuck about this guy. I only realized he did a face reveal today.
I kept scrolling past this vid thinking it was a community post
The Charlie sound bites from this video 👌 all I needed 😂
6:00 my ex did that alot
cute cat and dog
Trying to figure out this drama is like trying to figure out Dark Souls lore.
It's weird how nudes and videos of moaning is only sexy if its a women doing it.
The videos of him moaning are very likely real.  People used wayback machine to look at dreams profile from 2019 when this is said to have occurred and the name for the Snapchat and picture line up. The victim also is proven from old tweets to be follow by dream in 2019 + dream is proven to have messaged fans In 2019.  Dream defense for this is really poor. He alleged that the account who owns the burner that posted about this incident is someone who knew him in the past and he confirmed he “was intimate” with this person, but nobody was accusing him of that so he kinda just confirmed he’s done it with multiple people.  The burner account isn’t the victim, they’re posting for someone else they are speaking for them, and dream has not mentioned the victim just the burner, which to me sounds like he saw “Dream moaning to a 16 year old” and just assumed that’s what was going on, he’s not really proven the story about a 16 year old false at all.
pyro beat you to ut
His gf is sucking his cocktail under his desk😂 6:19
pinngy your moan don't sound sexual, it sounds like someone put your big toe in a vice. Put more emotion and verbal inflection in it. 😅🤣😂🙂 juuust messing with ya.
🏀🏀
Happy thanksgiving, this made my week
Who cares about f*cking dream? 😂
So not puppy coded 😔 definitely do not wanna tattoo these moments on my body and brain 😖
another minecraft youtuber in controversies? Who could've thunk it
Dream is truly a Minecraft YouTuber now
I despise dream but he didnt film it- the other person did by the request of gumball's va, but he obviously was in that car. This is mainly just a situation of 2 adults acting like 12 year olds and the internet rallies behind one douche over the other because the other one is much more hated.
Dream really doesnt help himself with that moaning audio cause hes set himself up as just the type of cringey
I don’t believe any of the Dream stuff bc it happened literally the day after he made the face reveal, it was perfect time to let leeches attach and suck his blood, which is why Corpse Husband is never coming back bc all his fears will indeed come true. As for Gumball, I need for him to let us if this damn Gumball is being made or not
It’s starting to feel like to be a minecraft YouTuber you need to develop a criminal history also
So not puppy coded 😔 definitely do not wanna tattoo these moments on my body and brain 😖
Thanks to Charlie for showing his Turkey ass on this day.
I wish dream gets kicked off the internet for this
Who's ready for the remixed toxic gossip train
Far as I know this situation kind of reminds me of the Bible. There’s enough proof to be believable, but not enough to get every single person on board, so the rest just falls to faith
image dream was just a dream, by golly I bet it would be a dream
Remember Cryaotic? The internet hates faceless content creators, still hated dream after his face reveal because his content obviously aimed at preteen aged people. Maybe Dream should just take a long infinitive break
its what the mask is
I haven't always made the best decisions in life, but never in 24 years have I done something that could end my career and life like mine craft youtubers.
happy thanksgiving jesus
Happy Thanksgiving Charlie! And yes, i can definitely say that this whole situation is insane and weird, I'm not suprised that another minecraft youtuber is being exposed for weird actions.
0:01 just give the likes plz
Why is it always Minecraft YouTubers 😂
It's wild how people will literally side with anything against dream just because it's dream.  No one likes dream, but it's really hard to see how he did anything wrong in this situation. 💀
Im sure he wont find a way to dig his hole deeper...
I’m Canadian thanks giving was last month for me
DREAM IS FINALLY EXPOSED!!!!! He needed to be stopped long ago
i think it would benefit everyone, including Dream, if he just went away.
This Trend is your usual Death Note reverse psychology reveal mind trick business.
You've never done a tmnt mutant mayhem moist meter
Actually it's called X 🤓
"I'm the dude playin' the dude, disguised as another dude" is what i get from the treads
Team gumball
This situation was Dream's biggest IQ play of all time
Now THIS is what the point of the mask is
Hating Dream gets easier every day
TLDR dream is an idiot, but he isnt like evil
One of the funniest things about the clip in the uber is the fact that Dream tried to get the LGBT community to side with him because of the homophobic slurs Nic was saying when in reality the exact opposite happened and Nic is also pan 💀
Not only did he cheat in Minecraft, he cheated on his wife aswell
DREAM DID WHAT
Happy thanksgiving
The validity of shit like this is going to be more and more difficult to discern with todays technology of AI and deepfakes, honestly the most convincing evidence for this actually being dream is how shitty the evidence material and scenario is. If someone decided to fake the evidence it would be alot more convincing.
So the VA of Gumball from one of my childhood shows slugs a Minecraft YouTuber who I knew was sketch from the start, before/on Thanksgiving day.  Today is a good day.
He should of stick only to the Minecraft content just like allot off othe content creators
Eat your cereal
Dream's drama aside, when will you build that Exia in the background.
what a pretty cat you have, his/her coat looks amazing
Dream could honestly be at around 100+ millions subscribers now, if he was consistent and wouldn't have used twitter... He literally lost out on being the biggest gaming youtuber in the world because he wanted to trash talk on twittter
When Dream became a Nightmare
I'm killing myself, i literally never want to hear the moaning video again
Why do people keep mentioning pyrocynical?
Dream be trying to speedrun prison for years now lol
I'm thankful for this video Charlie 😊😊😊
dream groped my dad :((
Hasn’t Dream been exposed as a goof (kiddy diddler) multiple times now?
Didn't know I was going to hear Dream moaning to a minor today, but here I am.
My ears have been assaulted... Why I watch certain videos without dudes in them. Gonna commit scooter-ankle after this video.
what?? a minecraft youtuber accused of being a pedo??? no way.
I love Charlie is the news reporter for internet drama
happy thanksgiving mr jesus
the thing that pisses me off is that dream is getting hate for uncofirmed allegations that come from burner accounts, while Gumball literally committed crimes, defamated him, assaulted and threatened him just before being an a**hole to the driver, yet people champion him only cause the other dude is dream. appearently dream is a loser for not fighting back and getting beaten, but imagine what people would have said if he did fight back against a younger guy. the internet has just decided to kill his character no matter what and thats insanely sad
4:00 my ears have been violated
6:19  Minecraft villager having sex while poisoned (New dream vid)
Nah even if I hate dream, going off the fact the majority of these claims against him are since his face reveal, I think the internet is being the internet and is making up lies and stuff to hop on the trend of hating him. He could be a groomer (like everybody else is) but I doubt the low-quality video with zero evidence and only a Dream dream snapchat account is real. Most people are hating him to hate him and I see nothing wrong with hating him because I do too but to try and make him out to be a pedophile with no proof is just mind baffling and the fact people believe that video with no proof is just showing that people want him to be the big bad guy.
4:02 skip that part for your sanity
Im so glad dream is getting fucked up, never liked that guy.
Common gumball W
pyro beat you to the topic, skill issue
man i thought we forgot about this guy, damn it fellas
The reason i think the moaning clips are dream is solely cus dream called them revenge porn....
Not even 20 minutes and over 100k views
You know its funny that I have barely heard anything positive about dream if i hear about him to begin with.   I honestly keep forgetting he is a thing and am reminded by peepz I watch and enjoy. Yes its you Charlie.
"In the current digitized world, trivial information is accumulating every second; preserved in all it's tritness, never fading, always accessible; rumors of petty issues, misinterpretations, slander. All junk data preserved in an unfiltered state, growing at an alarming rate, it will only slow down social progress... The untested truths spun by different interests continue to churn and accumulate in the sandbox of political correctness and value systems.

From what I know, gumballs va had seen what dream did, and while blackout drunk walked up and just beat the shit out of dream. Then they got in a car and gum all went into a rant about how he is the Michelangelo of our time. So 🤷‍♂️ dreams a pedo , nothing new, gimbal beat his ass and called him the f slur .
that’s what the mask is
Another day, another Minecraft YouTuber turns out to be pedo. Normal
Nogla and brian predicted this
oh my god another minecraft youtuber being a pedo! Who could've guessed that one
nah jit trippin 🤣
went to 711 for thanksgiving charlie
I LOVE CHARLIE
bro awakened his domain expansion
Ho my god the cat
Did he nut?
Sorry but pyro reached out to deliver this towards us so you can leave now😊👍
Textbook narcissist??? That... came out of nowhere.
hearing charlie moan was not on my 2023 bingo card but im glad i got to hear it.
I think dream is innocent with most stuff, hes just annoying and creates his own issues by whining its obnoxious
i need a charlie thirst trap made immediately
I love how all the neurodivergent and LGBT people are giving gumball permission to say slurs because it's dream lmfaooooo I love us
I feel like all the minecraft pedos have a weird look in their eyes, like you can just tell somethings off
charlie u have gonorrhea
What a Nightmare, hope Dream doesn't have a panic attack.
5:05 what meme?
Like, the FBI started investigating MLK Jr even before he rose to a national standing and no one even glanced at Dream???  If you are doing thirst traps for your kid audience someone should be asking questions.  Gears should be turning.
6:20 this is gonna be used as evidence when people starts accusing Charlie XD
I was all in for watching Charlie go Super Saiyan
Crazy how the video is literally talking about people blindly dogpiling on Dream and Nicholas Cantu being fucked up yet every comment is about how happy people are that "Gumball beat Dream"  The amount of braindead comments here are insane
As a gay person, the Gumball VA gets a pass if he's calling dream it.
Bruh, don’t know why, but heading Charlie say “Dream vs gumball” in a mono-tone voice made me laugh hysterically💀💀 it’s like the shitting unicorns taken to court debacle
I was watching pyrolives dream vid when this videos notification popped up
6:18 😂
Ever since he took off his mask it’s just controversy
Bro you can't just hit us with Dream moans without any warning. I would've died of cringe if I took another nanosecond to pause and mute.  Btw, the person who had a Twitter fight with Gumball was a fake Dream account so I don't think we'll ever see that video
Can bro just get canceled so we can move on lol
yea i had a dude send me a moaning clip
It was about time lmao
Small note for you mr charles, dream did confirm that the moaning video was him, and that the snaps were real, he confirmed this on his private twitter, but his defense was that it was him sending them to an ex that was of age but had an issue with him
"Yea I slapped boxed u in front of the hoes" - OG Gumball
Just look at his face, it says all
Gumball clocking dream is what im thankful for
Videos were pretty much confirmed real by Dream but he claims he sent them to someone 18+ lol
lol dream being dragged into a contreversy every single second is flipping hilarious. happy thanksgiving.
We still got Gumball and Dream beef before we got GTA 6
dream looks like a standard Kik groomer
God damn Charlie posts more frequently than I eat
Christ. Im here im the comments ready actual bullshit. I hate dream and i dont like how his weird ass is doing wierd ass stuff BUT yall calling him a pedo without no evidence is crazy. A FUCKING COSPLAYER DIED ON TIKTOK BECAUSE OF *SUICIDE* from all the false accusations. I just dont want that to repeat. Yall no better than them brain dead rats in twitter running a loop in their cage ☠️🙏     If you gon hate then i dont have time for you but wait heres this just for you 🫴🏽🫴🏽🫴🏽🫴🏽🫴🏽🍆💦💦💦
I'm gonna be like 2 hrs late to Thanksgiving dinner because I'm making food still 😊 And watched this while waiting
I’m sure this wasn’t his dream.
IO!
I can't stand how people are rallying behind Nicholas Cantu. Yeah dream sucks but supporting Nicholas is just going to add on top of his disgustingly high ego
Happy ganksthiving ya nasties. Have a good day!
15 mins late
Didn’t all of this stuff start after he did his face reveal? Or was it before?  Also, I just miss the old time when it was just the old videos. I’ll always love watching clips of him wheezing. But I don’t like where things are with him now.
dream vs gumball is the last thing i would expect
dream's career seems like it'll mostly likely be over and i'm all here for it
Sheeesh
I'm Canadian, so we had turkey & stuffing before Halloween. Happy Thanksgiving To America.
I have been waiting for this video so I didn't have to watch 100 tik toks
Minecraft youtuber, what did you expect?
Charlie's moans will forever haunt me now 🥲
“He is so puppy coded”
This ruined my thanksgiving
how hard is it for youtubers not to touch children
Nobody is surprised, we saw this coming even before we saw the face reveal.
What's the deal? Another pedo?
This situation honestly just sounds like its ai generated
Gumball waterson beafing with dream the minecraft youtuber wasnt on my 2023 bingo card
Video Resumed: dream vs gumball is real. Dream being a p*do is not confirmed (to much evidence to confirm anything).
Gumball "walk em down" watterson
Glad I got to see Charlie's O face today.
cat is so CUTE
I wish moist, his pets, and his girlfriend have a nice thanksgiving.
Finally been waiting for this!!!!
Happy thanksgiving, Charlie
So dream is in another situation.
the fact that you actually put that moan in my ear🤣🤣. nah no happy thanks giving for u
5:06  After years of not knowing why that man screamed, I now know.  ...Sometimes, ignorance truly is bliss.
Dream never fails to fill me up with creamy, juicy, and slimy controversies
As the great Twitter user Zhang Yong put it, “fat minecraft man artificial jawline disgusting fortune”
Who tf is Dream?
I think the worst thing about this is that dream allowed/gave alcohol to a minor.
Dream situation IS crazy
Dream moaning is my ringtone
right after Pyro posted uh?
I'm sorry, Shane Dawson and his cat? His CAT? You know what? Nah, I ain't lookin' it up. I don't need to ruin today.
When I found out I shared a birthday with Dream I was genuinely upset. Seems there's good reason for that.
Bro got threaten by a scrawny 18 year old and thought he could use it as leverage
How dare you make me listen to dream moan with my own two ears
What’s terrifying is that we live in a time where any and all evidence can be AI generated. ANYTHING. And this BS has gotten so out of hand I’m tempted to just block any and all related to these allegations. I’m tired of it.
Dream vs Gumball before GTA 6 is insane to me
Imagine being pedo and a cheater. And people still defending you.
Dream said he never recorded Gumball guy .. Gumball guy asked some random guy to record him ... Dream was sitting besides the guy recording :^ Gumball guy looks like hes trash talking the camera guy not dream .. also dream never mentioned a 3rd guy in the car .. he always points on gumball guy , himself and the Driver .. he keeps bringing up new stuff brah i dunno
If you think dream is creepy ect. Why did you participate in his face reveal shenanigans
What a great thanksgiving.
With all the weird shit Charlie has seen, and he's surprised someone would send cringe messages with audio of them moaning?
Watched The hot box's video on this. Shit is wild!"
Only thing I know for sure about this whole situation is that if Dream keeps engaging, something new’s gonna come up or something like that.
Happy turkey day. You have such a cute kitty. Reminds me of my Korina but she had passed away years ago back.
Why is he so consistent
Should change his name to nightmare
Dream is the type of guy to write an entire essay when someone criticizes him
Gumball freaking Waterson givin dream the solid left right goodnight is my favorite thing ever
dream has always been a terrible person its just people havent bothered to say anything but now somthing like this has come out people have actually been like ''oh hes a pedo''' yeah no crap
The alleged dream moaning was disgusting and made me very uncomfortable, please never do that again.
Remember how Dreams response to an apparent leak of him with a minor was "It was revenge porn" instead of denying that he had sex with a minor...
got here below 1K comments
Dream should just call himself Nightmare after this lmao what a horrible way to go out
Happy Thanksgiving Io!! 💚💚
Dreams problem is that he keep mentioning gumballs VA being drunk and he is a minor. I wonder who gave and coerced him into drinking....
Mmmm
Never would I ever thought to see Gumball Watterson go One on One with Dream, what a Crazy timeline.   And Happy Thanksgiving Charlie and Everyone.
As a big The Amazing World of Gumball fan, you don't understand my reaction to the drama. It's literally like some sort of a fever dream
Dream shouldve stuck to his manhunts. The latest hunter is chris hansen
The problem is, dreams credibility is so fucked. Even if he's right, that looks like he is for once. People just don't give a Fk, if you weaponize your audience people won't like you even if you are honest.   A pretty good case of the boy who cried wolf.
Dream is just getting shitted on shits tragic 🤷🏾‍♂️
Oh god WTF
Ima wait until it’s for real confirmed that he’s a pedo before saying anything. Both the Pyro and Kwite situations should’ve told us that we should wait for evidence on both sides to come out.   If he’s guilty, he deserves jail time, and if he is innocent then, so many people owe him an apology.   Also Charlie, Badegg still hasn’t responded yet
6:18 charlie cums mid sentence
For the first clip, the person gave evidence + the avatar and name lined up with everything from the time of it taking place, dream himself confirmed it in a later tweet but claimed it wasnt a minor
Charlie got me bricked up with that 6:18
so theres no proof that dream is a kid diddler, its just altered or faked vids
This reminds me of the yandev situation their both trying to blame it on the real victims
6:00 lmaaooo damn i always thought charlie was at the forefront of degenerate horny knowledge, but i guess not cus lots of ladies, and even some gentlemen, LOVE moaning vids ahaha
Charlie is farming those no context compilations today
This is a literal fairy tale
One thing I remember seeing (but didn't save) was when he made a random post where he said rap music was bad because they only are about something like "Murder and drugs", which is a racist stereotype. And when a small black creator criticized his racist shit, a locked account supposedly of Dream sent his fans to harass them. Also that post he did trying to throw himself a pity party.
On todays holiday, I'm thankful to Charlie for always doing these videos so I can never be out of the loop on anything whacky, goofy, etc. Power to the Moist!
After so many past debacles of cancel culture, all of which weirdly involve a bunch of unprofessional SoMe posts with no involvement of law enforcement, I do not take these accusations seriously at all and try my best to not partake in the mob.
was patiently waiting for this video lmao
I love how even the LGTB community is on Gumball Watterson side
Alright so when is the dirt on tommyinnit gonna come out.    Just kidding, unless...
Dr squatch ad asking me if I "want to be the head of the grooming empire" doesn't seem great for the video.
I’ve been waiting for Dream’s downfall for so long
Gumball is so real for that
Me whenever I find a video from Charlie uploaded less than 5 minutes ago: 6:18
Finally I was having trouble figuring out what was happening on my own
i could have done without the moaning in my ears, yuck 😂
6:19 No Context Clip
My accunt is older than dreams fans. Almost older than dream himself.
The only minecraft youtubers that I respect are the OG mindcrack people. So many weirdo sleazeballs in that community, but at least they've always been pretty damn real and down to earth.
wtf?
it is so easy to fake shit nowadays, its insane and stupid people will believe it as soon as they see it just because they have a hate boner against someone
DREAM DID WHAT???
Dream went against a 20 year old who was drinking when he shouldn't have been, who allegedly started spouting slurs and punched him for no reason....and lost. I don't wanna be an asshole, but Dream is THAT big of a loser
It was never proven that Nicholas Cantu said any slurs. He did verify the other claims and said that he was being an asshole and was drunk and is trying to do better. For me it’s weirder that dream 24 filmed at the time a 19 year old who was drunk and waited months to use it as a weapon to benefit himself.
Dream deserves jail for EVERYTHING
Funny how pyrocynical mentioned that Charlie wont be doing this and mins later, he actually uploads the situation
E
We need more io
I just finished watching Pyrocynical video
5:10 you mean dreamybull?
People want dream to be a pedo so bad theyll jump on any accusation. Im not on his side but jesus leave the man alone 🙄
I liked Dream. But I always Preferred Technoblade. Technoblade never dies.
minecraft youtuber turns out to be a pedo... nooooo, it can't be!!!!  (edit) also if you were dream wouldn't you just sue for defamation, win the case and then use that as proof you're not a pedo???
Let’s be honest here, none of us like Dream, but we can’t just hate on him all the time. When will y’all learn your lesson with hating on people n then they turn out to be innocent? And none of y’all apparently have connecting brain cells or else you would realize “wow this is dumb… they were close in age and she lied about hers” LOL like come on be fr. Y’all just wanna ruin people’s lives because you’re bored. Innocent until proven guilty but you don’t HAVE to talk to him during that time, and if you’re really concerned, we could go about this maturely. This world cannot think anymore and it’s ridiculous. If he is guilty then awesome!!! Glad he’s getting caught!!! But the evidence isn’t conclusive. He is more than likely innocent and I think y’all are just trying to get this dude to finally drop off the internet. I thought he was gonna drop off when his face reveal happened. I don’t like him but I also don’t like people being unfairly just.
Charlie is like the tip of the iceburg for the internet and then you get into the layers and your like wow
Everything I've seen from Dream is like a giant lesson in knowing when to shut up. People throw these allegations at Dream to troll or whatever, Dream bends over backwards and addresses absolutely everything thus giving the accusers exactly what they want, and the allegations continue. He needs to get off the internet for like a few months at least if he wants to avoid insanity or jail time
Ah, damn. I liked his manhunts and the Dream SMP. But unfourtunately, damn. He is a werid guy, which is unfourtunate as I wanted to see what he would do next after that 5 man manhunt.
oh jesus 12 minutes ago
Dream being dream as always
Dude was almost CERTAINLY in a manic phase, amped up by intoxication, speaking as someone who’s been in such a state many times
Whats crazy is the his audience’s first thought won’t be “oh he’s a creep pedo” it’ll be “oh I have a chance”
THATS WHAT THE MAAAASSKKKK IIIIISSSSSS🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
Dream better have documents of evidence if he wants to debunk all of the allegations that have ACTUAL evidence against him. The problem with the internet is that a lot of people are just looking for attention and make wild allegations, however, that’s not to say all of it isn’t true, it’s just that everything has become muddled.
Dream is a creep, but Gumball also seems like an asshole. I was actually surprised when i saw people defending him. No matter what’s going on, don’t say shit like what he said. He sounds like a DBZ villain. I’d understand why dream recorded it if it was meant to defend him if Gumball decided to go out and say dumb stuff in the future concerning dream. Dream’s a weirdo tho 😭
The best/worst thing out of all of this is that we now know what Charlie sounds like while wanking.
I am thankful for a Charlie video posted on Thanksgiving gobble gobble 🦃
worst thing he did was take that mf mask off
Wuba wuba
I doubt anyone over 18 watches dream. Lets just use occams razor here
6:19 😂
hello fellow humans remember, dream is not human. he is dumb content creator.
This was the moment where Gumball became heisenberg
lol common sense. We would say nightmare.
Goodmorning charlie
fuck thanksgiving.
the amount of comments after 1 minute is insane, watch the video first ffs
Sounded like a DBZ powerup
if u told me I would be listening to a grown man (possibly dream)  moaning into my ears today I wouldnt have woken up
Happythanks giving
Plz like my comment just because
I dont care for dream but I never understood hating him to this degree. So many allegations with the weakest evidence just bc hes the guy its funny to clown on and ruin. Any reason to side w Nick Cantu is hollow too hes clearly just as cringey and even more immature. If the allegations are true I hope he gets whats coming but so far this drama is just sick fucking gossip on some fuckin minecraft tuber. Drink more water and go outside ffs
nobody :  gumball : FAGG-
The HAAAAAA got me😂
The words "minecraft" and "youtuber" have a bad rep at this point
My whole world transformed when I saw charlie's cat
W gumball
Let's  be real.. we've all been waiting for Charlie to roast the fuck outta dream  If anyone sees my dad (he's gone for milk) tell him I'm famous 🥹
Dream being a pedo is about as surprising as finding milk in a milk carton. You’d be surprised if it wasn’t there.\
Happy thanksgiving penguinz0 and to everyone 😊🙂🙂🙂
When you finally try to check out one of dreams streams after procrastinating for the longest time and you hear this banger on stream: “ it doesn’T matter if she’s a minor” 💀
He went from dream to nightmare.
Dream is always tangled up in SOME goofy stuff
He’s already messing up. Even if he’s innocent, don’t say ANYTHING! Gather the receipts, THEN make your case.
2 minutes, 15 seconds into the video. " not sure what you can trust and what you cant".  NONE OF IT FOOL, its faceless allegations on the internet! Have we learned nothing?
Peanut Brittle
Another most cynical video about nightmare and gumball 💀
Having a 1 year old video of a drunk 19 year old seems like blackmail material to me.
The video of Gumball’s voice actor drunkenly ranting at his uber driver before roasting Dream to his face has to be one of the funniest things I’ve seen in a while. Could only think of that episode where Gumball becomes an SJW and tells Carmen to check her privilege.
I couldn’t agree moore
Guess he should've kept hiding his face
A minecraft youtuber being a pedo is as surprising as finding dirt beneath grass, just not surprising at all.
Dream is not a pedophile, I’m not on twitter so I don’t know what he posted on there but from what I’ve seen he is a good guy who just makes fun videos of YouTube also the actor who assaulted him ( don’t want to give him the credit of using his name ) is the one who is wrong, he attacked him, threatened to kill him and he went on some long narcissistic rant
Gümball
I ain’t reading allat
I WAS NOT READY FOR THAT MOANING CLIP🤣🤣
It's always the minecraft youtubers....
based gumball
I am hella early
Honestly I’m surprised every Minecraft YouTuber isn’t in prison
I see an RG Exia in the background, nice
the fact that people didnt care the first time he was outed as a pedo and it took him being accused and proved to be one twice is insane 💀
It’s finally out
Its wild, like, Dream admits to not only the texts being real on his priv, but then claims the videos of him moaning is 'revenge porn' against him. Its wild
do more vids with the dog and the cat please
Welp I'm only finding this out so this is very interesting indeed
Dreams lolcow arc is coming in nicely toobs
Like is too short. The last thing I want to think about today is dog vomit. You are a good kid, I wish you and all of your friends and family well. You make sense. thati's golden nowdays.
Happy thanksgiving Mr moist
Never realized how fantastic Charlie's eyebrows are
Nah people absolutely send horny moan videos online.
finally getting this POV is what i needed
Marry Me CHARLIE! I adore you! Xoxo
Dream has always been the internet's Charles Manson
still gonna be on gumballs side
Pyro actually beat charlie for once
yes i agree gumball is udb dumb
Your dog lookin jealous of your cat
I cant believe at one point that dream and technoblade had a minecraft fight to see whos better, but now dream is this cringy guy and everyone remembers technoblade as this funny guy that everyone loves .
somehow after watching this video i care even less about whatever is going on
6:18 You're welcome.
I never want to hear Charlie moan again.
looks like praying on his downfall worked
4:00 welp, this ruined my entire thanksgiving :D
hi penguinz0
if gumball was still airing there would 100% be a episode of gumball getting into an argument online with a guy in a green hoodie saying "that's what the mask is"
This is what the internet wants to do on Thanksgiving. Lol. Who gives a single fuck
Man why target dream? First when he had amazing RNG and people doubt.. now some democrat claims more lies.. why can't people just focus on making their world better by starting at home and not by screaming and running around in circles yelling "racist, sexist, and rape"
Charlie gets the first and last work on so many of these things. I never heard of Dream before and probably won't search for further content. But I heard this.
We got Dream and Gumball beefing before we got GTA 6.
6:18 good lord, charlie.
TRUMP WON
Bouta eat like Richard Watterson tonight 🔥🔥🔥
I don’t think anyone has said this but happy thanksgiving charwly
Gumball fighting Dream is something I never thought the year would end off of and you're lying if you said it would.
There are definitely people who would send and/or like a moaning clip. Never underestimate the power of honry
CATO? DOGGO?
not even an hour after pyro uploaded the same video XD
I bet he wishes this was all a Dream
The legacy of Dream is nothing but a dream for Dream.
knew he was a cheater, but jeez.  However, even if that was his voice, its so easy to spoof now that its hard to confirm anything off that anyway.
Happy American Turkey Day
Gumball must feel like homelander right now
Guys, leave Dream alone. His friend recently passed away...he's in a deep place...and by place. I mean kids.
A kitten and a puppy. Love those little creatures.
Happy Thanksgiving guys
Just like how we all now think that humans back in the 60s were stupid for believing smoking was good for you, 50 years from now, humans are going to believe how stupid we are for letting any one having access to the internet without a license. Kids should NOT have access to the internet. And if an adult breaks a law or is found guilty with this sort of behavior, they should immediately remove his/her access to the internet.
I feel like when dream showed his face he looked like he would do that
5:10 Link passing a kidney stone
Dream fans and also non dream fans are throwing out lies in order to make real accusations less credible or to add absurdity and make more drama
So did dream just hold on to that video of him in the Uber so that he could get him out of some beef later in life
I miss the man I was before I heard that moaning. I'm a shadow of my former self and my innocence has been ravaged.
Have you seen how many fake Dream accounts there are?? And that moan doesn't sound like him, Dreams moan is deeper, you can hear it on some of his videos. I don't believe ANY of the allegations, it basically made up gossip.
Lmao Shane Dawson catching a stray
The Dream moans made me want to die ngl Charlie
Sounds like some goon culture shit fr fr
Just ate TOO much turkey, protein galore, belly bloated, I'm going to go to sleep now.
Pyrocynical
This is the exact reason im glad i never got on the dream train when it became popular
Womp womp
I saw an edit with Gumball as Omni-man in the "THINK MARK" scene, talking down to dream, and that was the peak if this situation so far.
did you have to play the moaning
i think the biggest mistakes in history are, the art school not accepting the ¨Austrian person¨ and dream taking his mask off
IO has gottten sooo big. Love seen how far the little fella has come Although seeing her on a particular video seems a bit weird while saying this.  Love seening how  the animals are doin'😸
6:19 i can see this getting clipped out of context
Whats sad and fucked up is, it all started when he took off the mask.
Completely unrelated but last night I had a dream going to a Walmart mall and I saw dream was doing a meet and greet and I wanted to meet him while calling him a pedaphile while taking a selfie with him
Dream rose to the peak of Minecraft then slipped on the icy cliff of his face reveal and into the dark pit of twitter and got caught in a web of allegations to then be eaten alive by everyone else on twitter
Hey 0 , Tectone try to diss you and act smater that you, but he in bad fate
I'm so glad to see more of Io!
Dream hacked my Genshin account, spent all my primogems on the weapon banner, and set my co-op status to "that's what the point of the mask is"
Suprised in the world of twitter gumball did'nt get attacked for what he said😂
I LOVE how other YouTubers didn't play the Snapchat audio but Charlie just sends it lmao
thats a cute animal on the opening, i really want to pet it. and Io looks cute too.
6:17 SURPRISE 💀💀💀💀
NIcE
Happy Thanksgiving charlie!!!!!! The best youtuber on the platform. Love ya, man. You're a genuinely good human being and hope you have a great day
BRO HAS A CAT, LORD HAVE MERCY IM ABOUT TO COMBUST
Am 5,678 like
gumball dream boxing match
Happy Thanksgiving Charlie!
I wouldn’t be surprised, but with the Kwite situation being debunked and the Inquisitore Ghost situation, we need to be careful. Even if it’s Dream. I hate Dream, I think his handling of the first grooming allegations was horrendous and he behaves weirdly with minors on main. But we seriously need to be careful. As Kwite said: Trust the victim, but confirm it’s true.
On this Thanksgiving, I'm thankful that Charlie is bringing more light to the Dream situation They guy keeps getting away with it, he needs to be cornered and dealt with
ree
Literally all he needs to do is shut up and make Minecraft videos. Dream is his own perpetual Streisand effect.
Critical looks like john redcorn he even sounds like him
Im sorry, but I have to drop it everywhere:    omg 😱 28 dollars 💸 for cookies 🍪 it’s 4 bags 🛍 , that’s 7, 7 dollars 🤑 . i know, i knooooow math 🤓 💯 📚 is hard when you are an idiot 🤪 buttaaaa if you are a broke 💅 boi 👦 just say so 💁♀
Yeah Charlie stay talking about other men, your poke coverage was extra incel
KITTY IN THE INTRO
4:00 God not in the front of my roasted turkey ~
🏀🏀
this would make for an absolutely fire amazing world of gumball episode. "The Slap" *terminator voice Gumball * "Don't Mess With The Watersons." *wacky dance *
Been waiting for this video!
DREAM DID WHAT?
Every comment was posted before the vid was watched. Guys just watch the video before picking sides
no way he said “this isnt just the joke of the week” hahaha bro needs to go back to speed running he isnt cut out for this internet shit
Imagine holding on to blackmail and immediately having it backfire against you
IVE BEEN PRAYING FOR HIS DOWNFALL 🙏🙏🙏🙏
The first time I ever heard of Dream was because of drama. The second time after not hearing him for months was because of drama. The third time again is because of drama. He's like a controversy magnet.
Mmmmmm Apple
pyro beat you dude, how did you let that happen?
FINALLY oh my god. watcing it all unfold without a charlie video was so sad
the fact this all spiraled from dream taking off his mask is crazy 💀
Been praying for his downfall 🗣️🙏
A pilgrim tradition.
This thanksgiving I’m thankful for Gumball punching dream
What’s with these Minecraft YouTubers being shady af. Real clowns!
anyone else mute that one part?
I literally knew this was going to happen, not even a surprise lmao. Dream is such an L 😂
IM DEAD
Dream is a joke and i will arrest him for that
It’s always dream 💀
17 isnt a child, better be someone under 13 or i dont care
Ok but Gumball "lay em out" Watterson slapping tf outta dream wasn't on my 2023 bingo card
I never thought I'd ever hear Dream cream
1 hour gang
Dream had always been a creep. He looks the the joker ffs
Dream vs Gumball is something I did not have on my bingo card
dream needs to just make the video
the manhunter has become the manhunted
Charlie sounds like hes on qualudes here lmao
I couldn't have dreamt of something better.
Dont let your memes be dreams
bro i was tabbed out and then 4:00 started playing and i jumped. god damn it i shouldve paid attention i need to clean my ears now
Dream drama is like the Fate series you dont know where to start or even continue
Also Charlie dream confirmed he was the one in the Audio
Happy Thanksgiving, charlie! I hope you're doing well.
Honestly the biggest problem is that Dream will not shut the fuck up about the drama and whining "oh my god so what if i am a cheater, a p3do, an awful streamer, boo hoo" it is making his image absolutely AWFUL whether they're right or not. Like, holy shit stop yapping you are not looking like the good guy.
we got Dream getting smoked by Gumball before gta 6
Dream became el marcus real quick 💀💀⚫⚫🔴🔴
Why is it so hard for influencers to live without commiting disgusting crimes?
i need a meat canyon video of this whole gumball and dream situation
Noncey chap that Dream.
It’s over for dream this time
As Amazing world of gumball once said  “But age doesn’t matter when it comes to love”  “Legally It kind of does”
i love how no one cares what Gumball said lol... like i could not give a fuck
591st
I hope the gumball guy is okay
This has to be one of the thanksgivings of all time
thankful for dream’s downfall this year 🙏🏼🦃
bro will fr not stop yappin
Dream is a pedo is true
ngl charlie explaining how ppl on twt make a million different threads and new accounts just sounds like a regular tuesday for kpop fans lol
That's crazy... Dream being a pedo isn't that surprising tho 💀
I am english, last unday i had my first ever thanks giving, qnd it was eith the girl i like and her family and a few other people who i know lmao
Dreams only crime is looking so damn creepy, like damn boy if that’s not the face of a diddler idk what is💀🤣
dream got destroyed by gumball unbelievable
I love how his voice and video aren't synced lol
Oh boy twitter drama
Pyro posted first
W Dream
Isn't dream that guy who has to cheat at minecraft? Why wouldn't he try to cheat at Twitter too? I can see him muddying the water with fake accounts to make the legit accusations seem like just another random list of accusations with little to no clear understanding of what the actual truth is.
Kirby cat
Dream lore is now more confusing then dark souls lore
Minecraft Youtubers 🤝 Being Pedos
why is there hair on his desk
Kitty!
If you told me last year Dream gets beat up by Gumball, I would think you were crazy.
The dream situation is actually crazy though. I'm glad charlie is digging into it
i ain't reading allat
Gumball with the left right goodnight
cant believe pyro beat him to this one
hey charlie
My favorite rap battle from history: Dream Minecraft vs Gumball Watterson.
Io big now
With as many "this weeks joke" as he has create, its hard to believe or take anything this guy say seriously. You have no idea if its actually something serious or if its just another attempt to gain clout as he is losing relevancy. If it is something serious, is he expecting his fanbase of teenage girls to seriously do something about it on his behalf?
Dream vs gumball Watterson will be in the hall of fame of internet
Can we all be thankful for all he has given us.
I got an exam to answer in 7 hours .. its 1:30am and watching this is obviously more important then my exam
That start with the cat is very cute I must say
cant believe a minecraft youtuber is getting clowned by gumball fucking waterson
im edging btw
the day a minecraft youtuber isn’t a pedophile is the day the world stops spinning
More Stupid Drama. Great.  Anyway, Happy Turkey Day, Boys!
is dream even real maybe hes just a... dream
Can't wait for the Ray William Johnson video on this.
testing to see if the bots will show up
Someone should make an AI gumball voice reading Cantu's tweets
Have yall watched the latest skibidi toilet?
My expectation was always low for Minecraft youtuber, but HOLY FCK
He, can't, breathe when he's not doing the worst shit ever
Gumball: Great show, but ain’t no way he destroyed Dream…W
I was just waiting for this video to come out🤣🤣🤣
Happy Thanksgiving
His dog AND cat
Why is it dream just cannot stop getting into drama?
Cat
Dream always
I joked he looked like a pedo during the face reveal but..😭
These guys are bots right, they commented paragraphs in seconds after the video posted???
This is one of the FEW dramas that i knew about before charlie made a video on it.
seeing dream getting absolutely decked by the blue cartoon cat is not something i was expecting
Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) is an annual plant of the family Asteraceae. It is most often grown as a leaf vegetable, but sometimes for its stem and seeds. Lettuce is most often used for salads, although it is also seen in other kinds of food, such as soups, sandwiches and wraps; it can also be grilled.[3] One variety, celtuce (asparagus lettuce), is grown for its stems, which are eaten either raw or cooked. In addition to its main use as a leafy green, it has also gathered religious and medicinal significance over centuries of human consumption. Europe and North America originally dominated the market for lettuce, but by the late 20th century the consumption of lettuce had spread throughout the world. As of 2021, world production of lettuce and chicory was 27 million tonnes, 53 percent of which came from China.[4]
There beef is way too funny bro 💀. It’s such a fucking joke.
Dream in jail is all I want for Christmas
Dream is weird and so are his fans. Like, the creepiest people. Maybe even worse than kpop fans.
cheers for this vid charlie
Dream getting slapped around is wonderful.
happy thanksgiving guys
No matter how people want to think of the situation it's super fucked that a over 21 was out drinking with someone they had to have known the age of and then tried to defend himself from the video saying another minor recorded it as if him hanging out with exclusively under 21 when he is 24 not a bit of a issue..... esp if you are drinking with fake fucking i.d.
Their are two gumballs, Jacob Hopkins and Nicolas Cantu.   I would like to see them both tackle dream  Also, happy Turkey day!
The fact that he insinuated he was holding that video of Nick for potential blackmail is absolutely NUTS to me. Shows how awful he really is even if the allegations aren't true.
Sending whimper audios is wild
Pyro beat Moisty to the finish line... But Turkey Tom been there the whole time.
Happy Thanksgiving to you too  🦃
MOISTGIVING
looking forward for the duel falloff of dream and nic 🙏
I cannot believe Charlie would copy Pyrocynical's video within a mere hour
Good video
Merry trick or treat
This is the greatest
idk man that dude just rubs me the wrong way
Yoo you got to keep up the good work 🙂 edit:yes I liked my own comment
I heard abt this several days ago and I’m so happy it’s gaining more traction happy thanksfuckingiving everyone <3
e
Kittie!!!
Bringing all of the comment bots together rn
Minecraft YouTubers always tend to mix up dating miners with minors
forget the dream drama can we just talk about that gorgeous kitty cat
Truly a dream moment of all time
Charlie blessing us with vid on thanksgiving. Thank you Sir!
Charlie: Dream Situation is Crazy  Pyro:Dream Situation is insane
Happy Thanksgiving 🦃  And Dream situation and Imma1st  Don't take some of my comments seriously. It's only a meme
when you’re in a falloff competition and your opponent is Dreamwastaken
Speedrun Any% WR 10m 3s  Dream really out here speedrunning the nursery
happy thanksgiving :D
This isn't surprising for dream.
What a floofy tail. My goodness 😳
Im the 458th comment
Dang
OompaVille celebrating because he finally released a video covering the topic before Charlie
Imagine being against a 20 year old who's blackout drunk and saying slurs and nonsense and still finding a way to lose. Classic Dream.
If I had a dollar for every meme I’ve seen that’s just Gumball Watterson beating the shit out of Dream’s Minecraft skin, I’d have enough money to buy Cartoon Network
Happy Thanksgiving Moist! -From Dunedin
Is being a pedo a cannon event for Minecraft YouTubers?
NNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYY
Something about minecraft youtubers and kids man...
gumball waterson clocking dream is definitely something that happened this year i can't say i expected
It was bound to happen sooner or later
next video be like: my moms sister father cosuins friend situation is crazy
We got Gumball Waterson beating up Dream before GTA 6
A pilgrim would die if they tried to think hard enough to debunk this
no way dream is still on the spotlight
i never thought gumball and dream would get into a fight 💀
He is a minecraft YouTube or I'm sure anything he got accused is correct.
Minecraft YouTuber Curse lmao
5 k views in 2 mints is crazy
Gumball wins high diff
funny blue cat
Dream and gumball may not be thankful for each other. But we are thankful for the content.
Over 7k in 2 minutes is crazy
real
This is just crazy. On the one hand, the only confirmed thing is he flirted with a girl 2.5 years younger than him.  On the other hand, I mean, come on. I would be genuinely surprised if he wasn't a pedo. He's practically a stereotype, fair or not. What definitely _isn't_ fair is he's getting all this shit, while Colleen Ballinger still has people kissing her ass when she's been caught on camera.
this is the greatest dream of all time
Tbh im not surprised
pyrocynical was first??!?!?!?!
hey critical this is an amazing video also thanks for inspiring me to do youtube 😁
thank you most critical for this video 👍
So much goin on before GTAVI
F**k your thanks giving
if this is how we are ending 2023, can’t wait for 2024.
Y'all fr be commenting without even watching 1 minute of the video
Gumball is based. Dream has been a dick for a while.
I’ve been waiting for this episode of moist cr1t1kal
yerrr
Keep dreaming... 😃
When dream gets married we shall present: The Bride and The Groomer 🎩💔💔
Dream is the type of person to cry for the rest of his life when someone insults him or tells the truth💀
If only he did it in character. Opportunity missed
Real question, why is there a zoo in your room
charlie should've titled this video as "Dream Situation Is Insane" to match dolan dark & pyro's slop video
:3 <- Charlie's cat making a Thanksgiving appearance
Dream never fails to disappoint
Twitter sucks
I never thought I would see the day where pyro would be one hour ahead of you moistyman. 😔
Little do there people in this comment section know that the dragon ball legends festival starts tomorrow
Happy Thanksgiving!
goofy ahh green dude
I’ve been waiting for this video🙏🏽‼️ This situation is hilarious
w gumball move
Oh god
A fine helping of internet drama being served up for thanksgiving dinner 😋
Watching Dream get destroyed is one thing we can all agree on to be thankful for this year.
Dream needs a pr team and some therapy
Gumball is clear
If you see this I hope you have a good day
This dream is already dead he just doesn't know it yet 🎅🎅🐈
what's thanks giving? (I'm British)
All I gotta say is : OOP..
dream is not very skibidi
Happy Thanksgiving Charlie.
finally, something to be Thankful for.
Alll I heard was he was a groomer is there more???
No way Gumball and Dream’s fight escalated so much that Charlie had to post about it.
Even though Dream is a POS, I see a lot of people brush off Nicolas' use of the "n" word so impulsively. What a strange situation.
Oh boy, if there is one Finale Dream isn’t ever going to end, it’s his Twitter blunders.
And I thought dream was forgotten about now... Gyat damn
Hello
I am thankful for the intro, the babies 🥺
Last time I was this early I was put in the NICU
Harpy tharnks garving!
Happy Thanksgiving 🦃
It's like live when you join a video quickly
Lionmaker: The Squeakuel
Dream speedrun to ruin career since face reveal 🦾
Crazy? I was crazy once
Imagine telling someone in 2019 that this situation will happen. Shit would be crazy 💀
Happy Thanksgiving 🦃
BRO ME AND MY WIFE WERE LITERALLY JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS AND HE UPLOADS
PYRO WAS FIRST   SLOP W
How unexpected
🦅
So that’s what the mask is for.
Make a video on just pearly things
Finally, Pyro beat him to it
Today is my birthday!
Y’all really on the bandwagon huh?
Happy thanksgiving!?!?!!!!!
CAT
wild
Wow
Doink
Bro should of kept the mask on at this point 💀💀💀
There is no real defending the claims towards dream, he's fucked, and that's it
Hello Charlie
dream moment
Corpse is definitely next on the pedo list 😂
Bro saw pyro’s vid and had to change the title from insane to crazy lmao
Dude this guy just CAN'T seem to get away from drama at this point
Charlie and his animals wishing us an amazing Thanksgiving has fulfilled my day.
I dreamt of this day
finally.
Oh Charles, you don’t know how long I’ve been waiting for this notification
👍
Do it stink
This Dream Situation is Crazy for sure! Super crazy and maybe INSANE
Dream responding makes you look worse and worse
Dream VS. Gumball’s voice having beef is a collab I never knew I needed.
If I can describe Dream’s entire legacy in 5 words, it would be:  Problematic from the very beginning.
thanksgiving n shit
I’ve been waiting for this video. Charlie you are how I get my news and I thank you for that have a good thanksgiving 😊
been waiting for charlie to talk abt this 😭😭
cant someone just call the cops on dream so we can be done with this shit
dreab
Bro recorded audio of himself jacking it bro 💀
This had no views when I clicked. Now it has 7 K after two seconds.
dream more like nightmare
I am receiving big Chad vibes from this prepossessing man
Haven’t seen someone destroy their own career as much as dream has
happythankgivingscharlie
dream getting punched by gumball was not on my 2023 bingo card.
He needs to take his normal pills
Dream always disappoints
☕️🗿
Ah RumpleStiltskins back at it
Happy Thanksgiving charlie, we got a heavy hitter of a video for Thanksgiving too.
Josh Giddey needs to take notes of Dream’s response📝💯

If you told me this is the direction a dude who was good at Minecraft was going then I'd have so, so many nickles
I was literally just wondering if you talked about this yet a second ago
Tha hood stands with Gumball
No
Hope you have a good holiday. Also the more he tweets (dream), the more shit he's gonna be in tbh.  Edit: GOD DAMN ITS BEEN 3 MINUTES THE LIKES AND VEIWS HERE-
1 minute gang⬇️
Dream really fought his gfs' favorite cartoon and lost thats crazy
Thats wild
Cat
This Thanksgiving I’m grateful for my  fav newscaster charlie; on this episode “can minecraft youtubers NOT be pedophiles?”
fantastic video as usual, i definitely watched the entire video like everyone else did just now
every time io makes it into a video it brings a smile to my face
Dream getting clocked by Gumball is what I needed this thanksgiving
You've become a pyro clone.  Shameful.
I’m thankful this video has finally come
Gadda love the wattersons
what did he do this time
The car at the start 😂
Its funny how we got gumball watteraon vs dream before GTA VI
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Dreams getting cooked LMAO
Happy thanksgiving Charles. None the less Gumball fucking Waterson beating Dream's ass is something else.
Commenting on every Critikal video until he responds day 1129.
Ah wonderful, this video goes well with my turkey and mashed potatoes
Dream just needs to leave the internet and stay away from drama. He cheated once on Minecraft and now it's gotten to this point. They are both bad people btw
I remember telling my friend months ago that I felt like dream was a weird pedo type guy, they always have a pedo face, I also agree with Charlie about the narcissism, like he is not a good looking dude yet he built all this hype, even had mr beast in on it and did a massive reveal of his face… it’s just a face
We saw bros face and it was downhill from there
dang dream is not beloved
Happy Thanksgiving 🦃
hi charlie
L dream
Bro biggest opps is gumball and the child protective services💀
This entire case sounds ai generated. Gumball from The Amazing World of Gumball vs Dream from minecraft
Been waiting for you to talk about this
happy thanksgiving, god i dont even understand dream at all
smoking dream pack
was that the point of the mask
So early
love how twitter immediately sided with gumball just because it hates dream more
I wish Charlie and his cat a happy thanksgiving
this is the most ai written thing to happen all year
Never been here this early.
Cool story bro
Josh giddey DID WHAT!!!!
Dream is like the creep who you see on the bus but playing minecraft.
Charlie cool af
Damn
Cute car
What did he do now..
Thank god for Twitter 😂😂😂
It's still crazy to me how Gumball and Dream are having beef like this in the year 2023. We really do live in the future, ladies and gentleman.
Ya we get it, you liked your own comment.
Thank you for diving through the filth and muck of twitter so we don't have to.
Gumball solos Dream.
It’s so goof that people are saying us queers gave gumball ‘permission’ to say the f slur. He’s literally pan
this video was 1 min ago
Happy turkey day charlie
God I just don't care for dream or gumball anymore
the downfall of dream is what IM thankful for this year
Heyyy girl 💅
Imagine being re-popularized from twitter drama featuring Gumball
Crazy world we live in
I’m just glad he’s gone and got caught, it was bound to happen
:3
Happy Turkey Day Charlie and everyone!
Dream is criminally cringey
Buy SOFI stock
first !!!!!
Sup
Can’t believe he can make his situation worse
Literally every Minecraft YouTuber is a pedo
Considering he lied about the whole speedrunning cheating scandal, yeah I don't trust Dream one bit.
1 minute ago, the earliest I’ve ever been:
dream is not having a victory royale rn
I always forget dream exists, everything I know about him is against my will
list of allegations still shorter than his response to a minecraft server drama fr
Wow
Meooww
Money. -Mr Crabs.
Charlie what would it take to adopt an Indian child
been WAITTTTTING to hear from u on this
Happy thanksgiving
Here I am really fucking 👂
Finally
I'm not sure I've seen someone fumble fame quite like Dream has
Bro already got 200 views and he just posted this 💀
That's what the mask is!
Gumball Watterson HIMSELF stepped up to smoke the pedo
PyroLive clone
Honestly this is the best thanksgiving celebration ever
Happy thanksgiving Charlie! Thanks for your videos!
I think crazy is an understatement
this is the greatest dream of all time
moist meter 10/10

Dream getting exposed for this doesn’t surprise me.
To answer the overall question. Yes Charles, id smash
I was waiting for this 💀
Was waiting for you to cover this. He needs to work on that video.
I was gonna say first but then realised that I'm not 8 years old
Let’s be honest, we all expected this
this got recommendet to me 37 seconds after upload
Early 🎉
Whoopsies that’d Dream do. Big mistakey is what it looks like.
Dream is always tangled up in SOME goofy stuff
Somebody just need to lock bro up☠️
