I love SKZ CODE.  They bring me so much joy and always make me laugh out loud.  That's a hard thing to accomplish, I don't laugh easily.  But I giggle like a kid watching these!  Thank you SKZ for all your hard work!
Where can I find a, I.N of my own? Such a beautiful good looking fox 🦊 sun in those eyes and a nice personality of sunshine with warmth. Even during the darkest of his days,he does it for our stays. 🤍 same goes for our Felix and Han plus Lee know.🩵💛🤍  -every stray kid that I didn’t call out was still amazing in that video,  deserved a trophy.🏆
1:54  the left group seems like  the smart group, the right group seems like trouble some cool kids thinking, they’ll be smart or better, while the left seems to know better and they actually got this down, because they prepared as a group.😂
7:21 귀여워 용복이
14:20 Seungmin just stopped shaking his right hand for a second so for me it was obvious but I guess skz might not notice
11:12 hyunjin and jeongin dancing and singing easy by le sserafim, so cute <3

I can't with Changbin🤣
9:07 i love seungmin
hyunjin outfit reminds me of awkward silence era
i.n's laugh at 9:03 <333
Despite knowing what this is about, I still thought the intro was someone introducing the fact that they made other life forms (Stray Kids). It makes this even funnier to me because it's like they're discovering things we already know lmao

아 개재밌네
Idk why but Felix looks like some crazy scientist 😭🤣
Ahh, Lee Know.... they keep underestimating you!  Why do they forget you're the God of Games?!?
They're always nagging on Changbin about his weight and eating, and I know in S.K it's a thing to be skinny, but honestly, he looks so good a bit beefed up. He is not fat at all, he looks so manly and good.
Scientists❌ Handsome Scientists✅
YAY I RESISTED THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME AS CHAN I FEEL UNSTOPPABLE BOUTTA GO KICK ANTIS ASS FR

나는 정말로 스트레이키즈가 역대 케이팝 그룹 중 가장 아름다운 그룹이라고 생각한다. 그들의 노래는 아름답고, 그들의 춤은 특히 뛰어나며, 나와 함께하는 사람들은 완벽하지 않다.  👇💖
💜
8:30 - 12:42 💖💖💖💖
현진이는 투자같은거 하지 말자

안녕하세요 그래서 저는 여러분이 제가 우울증과 자기혐오를 이겨낼 수 있도록 도와줬고 제가 자살을 생각하는 것도 여러분이 도와줬다고 말씀드리고 싶었습니다. 제가 웃는 얼굴로 잠에 들 수 있어서 행복한 이유가 바로 여러분 덕분이기 때문입니다. 나는 다시 웃을 수 있고 웃을 수 있습니다. 여러분 없이는 무엇을 할 수 있을지 모르겠습니다!!! 사랑해요 스트레이 키즈!!!!! im sorry if anything was misspelled im still learing korean!!
This was so much fun! I can’t wait for part 2! I love these guys!

as a biologist, i'm very happy to see they partially follow the scientific method (they explain the issue, then make an hypothesis, put in on test and get results). Congratulations to the staff that made the games, they were very creative.

Wow....something funny that just happened... I live in Iran...which is on the verge of a war with isreal now.... I felt like we're gonna become like palestinians... And i was like: "you know what's the best use of time while you're still alive and have internet? Go watch skz content and have a good laugh this rest of your life"   Idk if anyone is gonna read this, but i'm a little scared. Pray for Iranian people...they have been through so much war already...we don't need more...❤

Seungmin has such acting abilities and he's just an awesome presenter, plus  his natural charm, sense of humor and, finally,  a beautiful face, you can watch this endlessly,  he has grown professionally for a long time and not only, how I wish he was the host of some program or felt in some entertainment show.
Bro Seungmin plucking his arm hair is hilarious
I feel bad for HyunBin😂😂😂😂
쟤네는 너무 귀여워 (⁠ ⁠◜⁠‿⁠◝⁠ ⁠)

У Сынмина такие актерские способности  и он просто офигенный ведущий плюс его природное очарование чувство юмора и завершение всего красивая мордашка за этим можно наблюдать бесконечно он уже давно вырос профессионально и не только как же мне хочется чтобы он был ведущим какой-то программы или почувствовал в каком-то развлекательном шоу.

2. Videoyu görmeden mükemmel olduğuna karar verdim
It has been 3 years since I started listening to Stray Kids, I never thought I would be writing this and I will try to not make it cliche. The fandom has become really toxic and I have grown as a person from 2021, Thank you for saving me multiple times but today officially is the last time I’m referring to myself as a stay, I am ready to move on to the next stage of my life.  I AM OFFICIALLY UNSUBSCRIBING
SKZCODEEE🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

안녕 스트레이 키즈, 2022년부터 콘서트에 가는 게 꿈이었는데..., 7월 14일 런던 콘서트 티켓을 보고 있었는데 부모님이 런던에 가는 걸 금지하셔서 더 이상 볼 수 없게 돼서 아쉽네요:( 아제르바이잔에서 콘서트 할 수 있나요? 바쿠시? 이것은 매우 아름다운 나라이고 다른 콘서트를위한 장소가 있습니다. 모든 바쿠는 스트레이 키즈의 팬이고 당신의 콘서트에가는 것을 꿈꾸지 만 저 같은 사람들은 그것을 할 가능성이 없습니다 :(.사랑합니다 스트레이 키즈,이 댓글을 읽고 2024 년이나 2025 년에 아제르바이잔, 바쿠시에 꼭 오시길 바랍니다. 우리는 도시 전체와 함께 당신을 기다리고 있으며 당신을 사랑합니다!🩷

Left hand
I'm dying to know what fashion statement Felix is hiding under that lab coat! The suspense is killing me, but I bet it's worth the wait
Even when Felix is frustrated, he manages to be adorable.
Oh I love all skz codes but this one was very different, I had a lot of fun and seeing all of you happy made me even happier, stay happy skz
I MESS YOU CHANNE ❤❤😭😭😭😭😭
Lee know is king of observation wow ^o^ the entry ep was so much fun i love them so much thank you so much for this ToT
18:02 sugarcoat -natty
I'm convinced Felix's laugh could cure any bad mood. It's contagious in the best possible way
Felix's hair is like a fluffy cloud floating above his head
믿을 수가 없어!!! 그들의 머리카락은 모두 너무 아름답습니다.
Lee Know listening SUGARCOAT it's my vibe
So we aint gonna talk about the fact that Felix hair is divineeeeeeeeeeeee!
Changbin reciting his own lyrics in a song is my favorite thing ever😂😂
😂😂😂
Stray kids Congratulations on your 16 million fans, they will always remain close to you, we will always support you❤❤❤❤❤❤
Почему я ничего не понимаююю!?!? Я ради вас корейский учу! ААААААААААА
SEUNGMIN CAN DO ANYTHING TO ME AND I WOULD EVEN PAY FOR IT, HOW CAN HE MAKE OUR HEARTS FLIP LIKE THAT?!?!?
BRO THE SUBTITLES MAKE IT EVEN FUNNIER
Why’re they so funny 🤣🤣🤣 poor Hyunjin had a good run, it’d be funny if he ends up winning LOL
25:46 the editors also know about the paboracha 😭😭🤣🤣🤣
seungmin-ah you were so cute  this episode!!
Блин вы такие классные ❤
Naur way I becan watching this a day after... just... the HAIR! Big big complement to the stylers I LOVE IT <3

If the Stray Kids were scientists, the world would explode
Their hair are so gorgeous ✨✨
Han and Felix their hair is like so cute like them

SEUNGMIN STIMMING YALL
FELIX AND HYUNJIN LOOK SO CUTE
Me loving there new hair  Seungmin ,felix🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰❤️❣️🩷🩵💛💜💚🖤👑 Pls do not cut it
Почему феля такой мимими?? 펠릭스는 왜 그렇게 귀엽습니까?
Bang Chan: okay science, we like science, science is very good.... Who remembers it?
whatever those hair-trimming devices are, they don't exist.
when i.n said where is seaungmin bangchan face be like; huhhh.... ohh yeah where is my little child how could i forget him where is he
I think next week will be comeback
Bang Chan should've let his natural curly hair out. The kids permed their hair but Chan who has natural curls is hiding it.
Stray Kids<3
Hyunjin's maniac laugh at the end 🤣
8:52 "Dr. Bang is actually a robber" 🤣 He's been stealing hearts all around the world 😆💖

Hyunjin falling in love more and more every day we share a taste for grapefruit 😘😋💋❤️🖤❤️🖤❤️🖤❤️🖤

Felix cheering bangchan on was freaking adorable 🥲
Its confirmed,  leeknow has a 6th  sense  [Or just superhuman eyesight]
Lee Know is cute
Apparently, Seungmin is catastrophically  not enough for me on entertainment shows, especially considering that he was just created for them because not a single heart can resist  his natural charm💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
Who else didn’t know Felix could grow such thick and long hair? 😲
SIR FELIX NEWTON🎉

It will always be not enough for me, I want to listen endlessly to Seungmini's so soft, gentle and pure voice. This is a real paradise on earth, and looking at this angelically beautiful face, the most beautiful smile in the world, you just can't help but smile👼🏻🤍🥰❤
Seungmini is such a precious baby and there is nothing better than seeing his sincere smile and hearing his laughter at this moment, tears flow like a stream, his heart is pounding like a mad smile from ear to ear and you feel like the happiest person on earth🥺❤😭
It will always be enough for me to want to listen endlessly to Seungmini's soft, gentle and clear voice, this is a real paradise on earth🤍 And looking at this angelically beautiful face, sparkling eyes and the most beautiful smile in the world, you just can't help but smile👼🏻
I love them!!❤❤❤❤❤
Seungmini is literally the same anime boyfriend "flawless black hair, an unrealistically beautiful face, sparkling eyes and the most beautiful smile." So cozy and reliable, so sweet and sweet "especially when embarrassed" and at the same time insanely sexy. He makes you the happiest person on earth by his mere appearance.
SEUNGMIN MAIN VOCALS MAIN RAPER  MAIN DANCE VISUAL, MODEL, ACTING,  MC–You can go on endlessly because  Seungmin is really incredibly talented  and just amazing.
The image of Seungmin prince charming👑Seungmin's face is a porcelain angel👼🏻Seungmin's voice is a shattered heart💔
Kim Seungmin is the divine beauty  and angelic voice of all K-POP officially.
Seungmin is really just something  he is good at absolutely everything.
It will always be not enough for me  Seungmin his amazing voice can be  listened to endlessly and his incredible  beauty is simply impossible not to admire.
No, if it was impossible to withstand it before, now, literally after every appearance of Seungmin, his heart is shattered, he does not leave a single chance for survival.
Seungmin is beautiful to the point of impossibility in every sense, unrealistically handsome, incredibly talented, and he is charm itself in a living embodiment. Seungmin has perfect facial features, sparkling eyes and the most the most beautiful smile in the world.
My smile my joy my oxygen my day and night I have always had and will have little of Seungmin everywhere and everywhere more than anything in the world I want his solo album❤  I can't imagine a day of my life without your songs without your voice without you❤
Who let them in a lab 😭❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤SEUNGMINI❤❤❤❤❤❤ You can have an endless version of his voice,  his laughter, his smile, absolutely EVERYTHING, because I'll never get enough of it, I'll never stop admiring, I'll never stop loving. These insanely beautiful eyes that sparkle brighter than the stars, the most beautiful smile in the world,  these cute moles, charming cheeks, this wonderful laugh and an amazing voice.
I just can't stop being amazed at how much Seungmini has matured and changed, both externally and professionally, he is literally unrecognizable😳It seems that just a year  or two ago there was such a cute little boyfriend and now an unrealistically handsome man with his own style and such an incredible voice who does not stop there😭

I love a new episode of 💙S͓̽t͓̽r͓̽a͓̽y͓̽K͓̽i͓̽d͓̽s͓̽💙 keeps me entertained. yes I likemy comment.
I loved this! The Sus lab idea is just so funny >w<
I've never seen someone rock a lab coat quite like you do, Felix.
こんにちは
Seungmin is the perfect combination of cuteness and sexuality, and most importantly, it is given to him by nature. He doesn't have to make an egg to be cute or openly show off his abs to be sexy. He is the very embodiment of sweetness and charm of charm soft facial features cheeks softer than a cloud the most beautiful smile sparkling eyes combined with perfect masculine cheekbones and plump sensual lips. And this is the most deadly thing because in front of you is an unrealistically seductive and sweet angel who  in an instant, with one phrase or look, can melt your heart with the hottest flame.
Superstar?!!!!!
gosh this is hands down my favorite skz code to date. the teasing, the challenges, the laughter, the HAIR😭 this made my night, thank you for making me laugh so hard after a long day!🫶

han jisung's laugh is adorable
Oh my god, Felix looks amazing
23:25 Han did not say "wow, no way" He said "wow, legend" Han was basically saying Lee Know was a legend or legendary.(of coarse)(Han knows what he is talking about)     "no way"? come on, lol.  I really wish they would put what they really say every time though. please.  Oh and after that Felix says "amazing", not "wow". And Hyunjin said "Lee Know is Lee Know" Hyunjin didn't say "Lee Know is mighty", though he is (mighty), I'm just saying ... ok I'll shut up now lol . They are all great. STAY for SKZ forever!
😂
Seungmin was not normal in this episode,but they really made this episode funny😂

面白すぎた。悩んでることが吹き飛ぶ動画をありがとー！眉毛...＾＾w
I played along and I actually guessed that Lee Know would get 4 right 😂 I knew he’d be good at that game because he’s incredibly observant- in the last Code, he revealed that he can tell whether someone had food or alcohol the night before just by looking at their cheeks!
This SKZ Code episode was so funny!! 😂😂 Can't wait for the next one to come out next week! Keep up the great work guys!! ❤
4:57 JAKAJAJA SOY CHAN ESCUCHANDO A SOMI

Free Palestinian 🇦🇪🇦🇪🇦🇪🇦🇪🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰boycott Israel  stay d0nt forget Palestine innocent people
I've seen 'guess the Stray Kid by their eyebrows' quiz before, but usually it's the whole eyebrow, not just one hair??! SKZ staff are insane for this and it's more insane that LeeKnow guessed 4/7 correct?? Like what? Even with one fake hair there! Like how??? 😂🤣😭
so excited for next ep
Someone take the scissors away from their hairs
I really like the fits for this episode. Also Stray Kids long permed hair era???!!! cute!
I cant wait for the next episode 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
WHY THE NEXT WEEK‼️‼️😭🤌
2 menaces namely Changbin and Seungmin, not following instructions. Instead of plucking their eyebrows, one chose to pluck an eyelash while the other pluck his body hair 😂😂
Hyunjin dancing in the booth is my last brain cell.
귀엽다

Absolutely love this video xD
I can't stop laughing, guys ahahahah
1:43 Living with Lee Know, I.N and Seungmin is definitely bringing out his savage and prankster personality. Also I feel like Lix has matured a lot and you can see that members don't hold back from teasing him anymore and he's started to come out of his sunshine personality and show us more of his sassy side. He's become mentally stronger. I'm proud of our Straykids for coming this far <3
Lee know ı love you♥ 🐱🇹🇷🇰🇷
I liked the video, it's funny hehe❤
Not him dancing to super shy lol 😭 19:28

26:00 They should've played Oh My God instead of Cupid😂
So what I've learned from this episode is that SKZ love to see Seungminnie in pain, Hyunjin has pretty impressive tastebuds, Lee Know is the cutest menace ever to grace this earth, and Chan has a crazy strong core. Plus they all look divine with long hair, and coincidentally, I am falling more in love every day. I adore these boys. Looking forward to the chaos to unfold next week❤️
DR.KIM..? SO IT WAS SEUNGMIN ALL THE TIME?!? YOU KILLED THOSE PEOPLE
이렇게 끊는다고요???? 재밌다앙😊

I watched it and I was very impressed, it was amazing. What mad scientists, what experiments. Stray kids, you are amazing, you create miracles, it was great to watch. Stray kids, you are so natural, you did great, as befits scientists 😁 and you had a lot of fun doing it. I'm waiting for more great things like this 👏👏👏👏👏🥰
I miss your 😞❤️
김승민 왜 갑자기 양정인이랑 닮아졌냐 ㅋㅋㅋ
Como extrañaba los skzcode, no puedo esperar hasta la otra semana. Me sorprendió lo bueno que fueron Hyunjin identificando los sabores y Lee Know las cejas, una locura, yo no hubieran acertado ninguna ceja jajaj donde sí hubiera ganado fue adivinando que lado del brazo tenía Seungmin el aparato, en un momento fue muy obvio que lo tenía en la izquierda
Stray Kids forever love you you you💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋💁💁💁💁💁💁💁💁💁💁💁💁
Guys, let's buy back all the scissors and melt them down)
Amazing😍

❤❤
FELIX'S HAIR 😭😭😍
너무 웃겨.....😮‍💨
21:08 えまって今年のきむすんみんデレデレすぎんか？？？？
The difference in experiements cracks me up. Hyunjin gets to sip some yummy juice while Seungmin is getting zapped for lols
Hair stylist definitely needs a raise!!!!
みんな最高
HAN JISUNGGGGG i love you!!! <3 love the perm and it suits you well
this is so funny HAHAHA
I wish the members would stop making fun of Changbin's eating habits. It's not funny and he clearly doesn't like these jokes. Stop that.
Felix Einstein a benzemiş msksls
Ay amo 😂😂 me reí tanto, justo que no ando bien de ánimo, siempre aparecen para alegrarme, son los mejores 🩵🩵
Someone take away the scissors from Straykids

The intro is so them. Han chasing after I.N. for a kiss, Hyunjin painting Felix, Changbin stealing Seungmin's microphone, and Chan walking in on Lee Know in the bathroom. Lollll  Also, oh my gosh their hair.😩

Felix alejate de las tijeras son enemigos
Since Lee Know got 4 that means he has a 50/50 ability to identify the kids based on their body hair
Lee know is indeed a cat❤❤❤
I love seeing this, it always makes me laugh! I love you❤️❤️ a little kiss from Portugal 💋🇵🇹
실험체로 날 갖다 써 임상 몇 백 번이고 해줄게 애들아

23:43 IMDATHWBSYVWDU2SHI2SKWDWUDHWVSUJWSDB
귀여워
리노는기여어
Hi ❤
This was so much fun. Lovely to see everyone enjoying themselves and laughing so much. Hide the remotes from Lee Know in future 😂😂
I can't take my eyes off of Seungmin from the first second of the first meeting of the first day, he has perfect facial features "plump lips, charming cheeks, sparkling eyes, perfect cheekbones and the most beautiful smile  in the world–this combination of cuteness  and sexuality" gives a killer effect😳 But how much Seungmin has changed and matured now, literally every appearance of him makes you lose the power of speech, pulse and consciousness are simply divinely beautiful😳
Songs skz were dancing to: Fast forward-somi(channie) Super shy-new jeans(lino) Cupid-fifty fifty(binnie)
Seungmini is truly an angel created by heaven, which contains all the most beautiful things that can exist. Such a small fluffy and so precious miracle is the very embodiment of sweetness and charm, it is an angelically beautiful face, eyes that sparkle brighter than the stars and  the most beautiful smile in the world to melt anyone's heart. Even through the screen, you  can feel how cozy and warm it comes from him that you just want to hug him without letting go to protect him from everything and everything.
Go Hyungs! Experience and keen eye pays off. 🥳🤣😂🤣 Very funny. Can’t wait for next episode to drop. ❣️
For so many years in K-POP and what kind of handsome men I haven't seen, but Seungmin I can't even describe in words just unrealistically beautiful perfect cheekbones, plump lips, charming cheeks, sparkling eyes and the most beautiful smile in the world–the combination  of sexuality and cuteness gives a killer effect.
I have only one question, from which podium  or rather Olympus did Kim Seungmin descend,  well, it's impossible to be SO BEAUTIFUL, SO BEAUTIFUL, AND FROM HEAD TO TOE?!😳 A DIVINELY BEAUTIFUL FACE AND PERFECT BODY PROPORTIONS, TALL LONG LEGS, A  CHIC WAIST, IT'S JUST MIND-BOGGLING😳
The shattered heart of Seungmini is literally  an angel to embody, in addition to the divinely beautiful face of the most beautiful smile, he is the very charm of sweetness and charm, looking at which it is impossible to look without a smile and tenderness💔Sometimes it seems that this little angel is about to fly up on his fluffy wings👼🏻
I love Seungmin's personal style and every  image of him really suits him, absolutely everything concerns clothes and make-up hairstyles. He certainly has taste, because absolutely always, under any circumstances  and occasions, he looks 100%. Even in a hip hop look, it will add elegance and sophistication. Simply elegant and tasteful, even in the most casual way, looking stylish is a real art.
20:58 nası gülüyo 😭😭🤏🏻
I will never stop admiring, Kim Seungmin immediately goes from the stage to the podium and then to Olympus itself. After all, in addition to the unrealistically beautiful doll face, he has just a divine figure, ideal body proportions "tall, wide shoulders with a back, long legs and a chic narrow waist" it is not surprising that absolutely any image suits him.
11:08 *( The researcher farthest away got him )* GOT ME T T
23:16 LEE KNOW GUESSED THE ONES THAT WEREN'T EVEN THEIR EYEBROWS! Seungmin- Arm  Changbin- Eyelash
Changbin looking so handsome 😍😍😍😍😍
Literally every appearance of Seungmin is a  heart to pieces, he simply does not leave a single chance for survival. Seungmin has always been handsome, he has perfect facial features, but now I can't even describe in words the divine beauty that shines brighter than all the stars  of the universe.
I will never stop admiring the divine creation  by name Kim Seungmin, I will never admire this beauty that only heaven can create. More than anything, I love to see him without makeup in  his usual clothes, so simple and impeccably beautiful.
한지성, 내가 한국에 있었다면 내 마음을 훔쳤기 때문에 경찰에 신고했을 것이다. 이번 생에도 당신은 항상 나를 웃게 만들었어요 Han 당신의 목소리는 매우 특별하고 깊은 인상을 줍니다. 그는 보컬리스트이자 래퍼이다. 샤이니 커버 정말 좋네요. 한지성님 덕분에 샤이니에 대해 많이 알게 되었고, 정말 좋아하게 됐어요.🇹🇷❤🐿
I've been in the K-POP industry for so many years and I've never seen any idols, but Kim Seungmin is something that even words cannot explain. He has such a natural beauty, a divine figure and a natural charm that even among idols is a huge rarity.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 재밌다

I knew baby Seungmin that you were just created for a doram unrealistically beautiful face and this is the aura and aesthetics that comes from you and most importantly such a natural and natural acting game that you want to watch endlessly.
it was a so good skz code ep (im waiting for the turkish translation to be published)
مثالييينننن😭😭😭
Seungmin is just created for doramas, he has amazing diction and a perfectly delivered speech that you can listen to endlessly, he has a very natural acting game, as if in a second he can  get used to the role that is needed right  now to show the image that is needed.
عيد سعيد ❤❤
Looking at Seungmin, I have only one question–how did this world deserve such a divinely beautiful and incredibly talented angel.
I will never stop admiring the divine creation  by name Kim Seungmin, I will never admire  this beauty that only heaven can create.
Не оставляйте меня без вас ❤ люблю вас так сильно 🤍🤍🤍

Research shows that watching SKZ Code increases your chance of random laughter; greater happiness; correctly identifying fruit; six-pack abs, and smoother, clearer skin.

Lee Know with the remote control for Seungmin's machine was hilarious. Seungmin did so well hiding it, though! And this hair on Seungmin is amazing, he looks incredible. I swear he gets prettier every time I see him. They all do. Also love Bini's hair like this.   I can't get enough of watching these guys just have fun and be silly together.😊 Their smiles make me feel better about life somehow.
22:52 2MIN MY CUTIES AHWHSBHWHUS
SEUNGMIN IS SUCH A GREAT ACTOR  ,, he fooled 5 members out of 7  OMG
와 이젠 스키즈에 강아지(뜽민이)가 출현하네.. 7:46 스키즈 편집자분 진짜 ㅋㅋㅋ 대단하셔요 ㅋㅋㅋ
Lee Know talks about the experiment with Seungmin in which he and Ban Chan responded correctly: "This is the power of an older man" 🔥
영상은 항상 너무 재밌어요 ♡

IS CHAN COLORING HIS HAIR?? 😭
19:58 любопытный котик🙌❤️
Felix is looking so angelic with this hairstyle although he is a true angle.
Of course, I adore all the members equally, but Kim Seungmin stole my heart at first sight. Honestly, I think he's awesome. His personality, his humor, his behavior, his genius, his smile, his existence. ALL. I LITERALLY LOVE ABOUT ALL. Minnie, if the whole world turns against you, we will always support you.🤍
HAHA I LOVE IT I CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT PART❤❤❤

I'm really going crazy with this combination  of Seungmini an unrealistically beautiful truly handsome prince and at the same time an unbearably sweet porcelain angel😭
DIV1 HAIRSTYLISTS. Can you guys stop neglecting Chan's curls and bother to style them properly instead of either straightening it or just hide it with a beanie?
너무 사랑해요 😭😭💗💗
J'ai trop aimé , merci pour l'épisode SKz. Vivement la suite. 😂😂😂😂 Lee Know est vraiment fort et Seungmin rigolo.

25:24 HE SOUNDS LIKE A FLY😭
اول عربية ستاييي💗🍥
not them calling minnie boring infront of him. welp, he does the same.
Han realizing that he lost by only one second...
I am actuallly impressed that Chan held that pose for that long!😮😮😮😮 New goal unlocked,lol. Poor Hyunjin losing the bulk of his test tubes,was hilarious! I would've lost all of mine. Plus I loved Hyunjin's dance session😂😂I can't wait for next week's episode! Let's go Stray Kids!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hyunjin betting 10 tubes is just😭😭😭 LOLLL--- And lee know being able to guess 4 ppl's eyebrows Is wholesome like- I can't even guess one 💀💀 Felix wanting blue tubes is so adorable 💗💗💗

CHAN IS SO CUTE OMG
Настолько драгоценный невыносимо сладенький и стеснительный baby  boyfriend с кукольной мордашкой сверкающими глазками и самой  прекрасной улыбкой в мире перед  которым не устоит ни одно сердечко.
이리노 왤케 기엽노 ㅠㅠ
21:21　ヒョンジンとヨンボクの眉毛当てられて大喜びしてるリノ可愛い💗ダンスラチャの絆💗笑
I can't literally wait for the next episode, that was incredibly amazing, I love them so much and thank you for making my day so much better, my happiness♥︎
"Hyunjin is a dummy" Literally all skz are dummies lmao, stays and skz share one thing in common.
So precious unbearably sweet and shy baby boyfriend with a doll face sparkling eyes and  the most beautiful smile in the world in front  of which not a single heart can resist.
아니 너무 재밌..일주일 언제 기다리죠
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Oyyy tiplerine gurbaaaaannn
離婚危機やばいコンニャンズじゃんかわい
Seungmini is an unrealistically beautiful doll  face, eyes that sparkle like diamonds and the most beautiful smile in the world😭👼🏻💎🌌
리노 진짜 너무 잘생겼는데 근데 너무 귀여워...
Felix really looked like a scientist 🥼💘. Everyone looked really handsome✨ hope to see chan's hair next weak ep(may be if he revealed). Loved this episode❤💕.Straykids make stays stay 💌
I love how in the intro with the skzoos, they are literally just pranking each other and being silly-
DIOS NECESITO LA PARTE DOS😭😭😭 como los amo
Felix looks so gorgeous, woah. He is glowing.
‏‪0:23‬‏ هيونلكس 🥺🥺

숙박을 위한 좋은 비디오! 스트레이 키즈 사랑해요 ❤️‍🩹
맛있는 혼합물을 갖춘 생선 실험실은 훌륭합니다👁️👄
Creatinine is a byproduct of protein metabolism. OF COURSE CHANGBIN is that one.

WHOEVER THEIR HAIRSTYLIST IS, THEY NEED SOME RAISE!!!
A mad scientist concept next AAAAAAAAAAAA
승민이 아기같아
I'm pretty sure since Lino already lost  he's trying to cheer Chan to get to the 6th option so nobody wins 😂😂😂
Oh my Hyunibini😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤😂😂
I love you hyunjin and felix ❤❤❤
Keep the scissors away, they all look handsome
13:25 top 10 disney villains evil laughs
Once again, I am convinced that Seungmini  is a real treasure trove for any artist, fashion designer, designer, etc. Such natural beauty  and perfect proportions are a model appearance from head to toe "any color, style, haircut and makeup" it is not surprising that absolutely everything suits him.
дети, хватит над батей издеваться=) Чани головокружительно хорош❤
I love Felix ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
‏‪ ‏‪0:01‬‏ يالله شعر مينهو 😧

01:43 용복이 목숨이 2개구나
I really wanna know what song hyunjin was listening to, is it a spoiler?!
EARLY 1 HR AGOOO
LONG HAIR FOREVER!!!
But without a doubt, Seungmini is created  to shine on stage and on the podium😳 This combination of the elegant prince and his natural charm perfectly emphasizes the figure  of "long legs, thin waist and wide shoulders"🤤
0:11 wtf happened to Hanis voice..

Que geis
3:06وجه تشانغبين😭😭

LEE KNOWS HAIR OMGGGGG❤
I love Hyunjins voice at the end😂❤
Eu amei ❤❤ te amo stray kids ❤❤
THEİR HAİR İS SO COOL , MY GOD
I really liked this episode, idk they seem a lot more energized now after their break. And the concept was really fun too.  Idk who decided to give lee know the controller but they knew how to make him happy. And guessing 4 out of 7 eybrow hairs is crazy good.
lt’s so cool!, love you❤

the hair omg i won’t be able to get through this video 😭
But that was the funniest one yet leeknow was on point. That was crazy. Even though it wasn't eyebrows 😅 did han even play or Felix??
It is simply impossible to take your eyes off Seungmin, this unrealistically beautiful face  and divine figure make you doubt his existence😳
Чего они все красивые такие!!!?
Kim Seungmin, you've been killing me with your beauty since the first second of the first day and the moment has come when you finally finished off my heart😭💔😰🛐
Can we talk abt Felix’s hair…. He’s so hot
Seungmini is such a miracle, well, unrealistically beautiful, impossibly beautiful and unbearably sweet shy girl who so wants to hug and protect from the whole world how precious he is🥺
FELIX'S HAIR.
long haired skz is my roman empire
The hair is extremely beautiful. Watching skz code is my greatest therapy.
Seungmin is HOT with the messy hair dude. But also <<<<seungmin forehead, so if they could combine the messy, longer hair with that, holy f we would be GOLDEN
Any international stays here 👇
Therapy: ❌️  Skz code:✅️

SEUNGMIN IS SO CUTE, I LOVE HIS HAIR SO MUCH!!
솔직히 주간편성 해줘 ㅠㅠ
This was so fun 😂
3:19 I didn't even know he could do it, how was i supposed to know how much time?
lol Changbin was not ready for Felix 😂😂😂
かっこいい研究者😊
No matter what the baby Seungmini does,  it is simply impossible to focus the eye, it is impossible to admire it, it is impossible to look without emotion, he is the very embodiment of sweetness and charm🥺❤😍
이게얼마만이야! 용복이 뽀글머리 넘큐트행🫢
애들 몇명 파마했네 진짜 애들은 어떤 머리든 잘 어울림 얼굴이 잘생겨서 그런가
This video is so funny 😂it's just awesome to see how much fun they have ❤
stray kids and their staff are really good at making good content! thank you so much to all involved <3
Looking at Seungmini, I have a problem there is only one question, how did this world deserve an angel of heavenly beauty with the most beautiful smile that shines brighter than all the stars of the universe🥺😭👼🏻🤍🌌🛐
I can't think of a Seungmini cutie that every time I see him, the first thing I think about is how can such a thing even exist in this world🥺💔😭🤲
서창빈아아아 왜 잘생겼어요
How little is needed for happiness so  that only baby Seungmini does not hide  his unrealistically beautiful face and the  most beautiful smile in the world😭🤲😍❤
AAAAAAA 😭😭 PLEASE I'M BEGGING ON MY KNEES 🙏🙏 PLEASE DON'T CUT YOUR HAIR
How much I love this vibe, which only he has, how much I love Seungmin's character traits: when he knows that he is good, but he will  never shout about it on every corner. When  he is completely confident in his actions and  just goes to the goal without changing himself, remaining as he is.
early ong
언젠가 당신의 콘서트에 올 수 있다면 터키인이기 때문에 터키에서 방찬으로 바클 라바를 가져올 것입니다💗💗

This is the first time i see Hyunjin flirt with Changbin. This was *the* moment lol
What happened to the end? Where was changbins results 😮
"research funds are their blood and flesh" who is writing these captions 😭😭😭
Seungmini is such a modest shy unbearably sweet, the very embodiment of sweetness and charm with the most beautiful smile in the world and an unearthly voice that heaven created, he is an angel incarnate👼🏻🤍

みんなめっちゃ可愛いんですけど、どうしましょう😂😂
Dear Han, I know you probably won’t read this, like ever.😂 But I’m still going to say this. I hope you know you’re the happiness of so many people, including me. My heart jumps whenever you post something because I already know it will be beautiful, no matter if you sing, dance, having fun with the members or just doing nothing. I found a vid of you even before I knew Stray Kids and from that first second I already knew I would be your biggest fan. And because of that I no know all 8 of you and it has been the greatest gift ever. The past 1,5 year I finally have something to look forward to getting off of work, because I know I can watch all of Skz content.   I hope that in life you and all the boys get anything you wish for and anything that you deserve. You all did really save me and especially you. I will forever be grateful about that and always support you. I hope that Stay makes you feel happy and loved the same as you make us feel.   You’re truly an angel and I love you so much❤️
Whoever adds the captions has some beef with SKZ istg😂😂😂
Skz look so good with curly hairs
Kim Seungmin and his vampire  vibe leave no chance of survival💔
