So I was lucky enough to be at the Summer Game Fest to try out M. Bison ahead of his launch of June the 26th! As you would expect when I get my hands on a fighting game, I had to really learn all the details and particulars and now I pass that info on to you! I am a huge fan of Bison but... not the SFV Version. That said this Bison is very much like the classic bison of the old days, very fast walkspeed, big buttons and all that! Classic Bison with some new things from SFV like the time bomb mechanic = a very fun version of the character. So give watch, leave a like if ya liked it and let me know what you think!
Dude its cool how the like button glows when you asked to hit it. Nice touch😮
if you dont get legend rank with bi i unsubscribe! gotem
I'm so glad Gerald C. Rivers chose to reprise his role as M. Bison. He's too iconic!
Remember when people would swear that he was dead and wasnt coming back...
SICK
i hope m. bisons third costume is the outfit 2 but with a cape.  any cape bison fans?
ill be honest: while akuma is my main. m. bison is my backup main.
You know what? The brown uniformed M.Bison just needs a mustache.
Even bison is awesome in this game.. i hope we get Vega, i loved him in street Fighter 2 since im a 6 year old kid
*the thing is about his new appearance is he is sadly homeless because he is suffering from amnesia but the thing is that he still has his fighting spirit in him but the problem is he does not know who he is*
"You see, in their last moments, people show you who they really are." 😂jokes on you...
Hobo bison
Coat of lions like us doing lion's good I throw away
Mr color 2 black knight wanted me at all. [Healing] come on, come and see, use a piece of green chicken, thank you, sir, use a brown chicken, thank you sir. Ooh yeah now love us new tablet and vacuum 3 to clean all of a mess up and clean that right. My rightward is good at us.
[La maison dive] [never die]
Do St.Hp is special cancelable?
If you know mega man then you would know this is hobo sigma 😏
The moment I saw he had psycho crusher as special move I already knew this Bison would be good. Just like SF4 Bison.  Btw everytime there's a new SF game or spinoff I always look for Bison psycho crusher as special charged move. If it has it, the chances are higher that I'm gonna enjoy the game.  The downside tho is that both him and Akuma (my favourites) are DLC this time around, so I'm gonna wait for Sf6 complete ultra challenge edition in the future.
the fighting professor graces us with another solid review
Think 50 dollars for 4 characters and 2 stages kind of pricey. Wait till season 3 comes out to buy season 2. Liked it better when they had 6 characters a year
Vega when out?
I actually prefer the vibe of SFV Bison, even with the slow walk speed. This version looks like a MK character with the physics.
The way bison stands in your arm during his level 3 reminds me so much of how dark link steps on your sword in Zelda ocarina of time
I like that bison took over sagats body, 2 of ryus greatest rivals/enemies melded together
nice im excited, new toys
Mood kindred in always just wanting standing medium kick.
I think they rushed him back
Sf5 bison had so many things to make up for his slow walk speed. This bison looks like a stripped down version in moves and combos. Looks poor unfortunatley
I wish he still had the command grab from SFV.
Very interesting.
I'm surprised nobody has pointed out that he looks like War from the darksiders game series.
at this rate i reallly wont be surprised when they releasee sf7 and its only modern contros.
No teleport command???
Why can't he teleport tho??
Is the health bar glowing?
I feel like M.Bison has everything Honda has but better and more utility.
His flexed arm and hand moves when idle are awfully distracting from anything on himself. From his winning pose and others, I can get there's something wrong with his arms/hands, we don't need this move the whole time to notice it.
Now if only they had character interactions 😭😭like ik that’s a MK thing but id love to hear what Akuma would say to Bison (as an Akuma main I need this)
Great video man as a street fighter 5 byson Maine.I agree bison was slow and now it looks like they just brought back all the best stuff with the newest looks and play!
Bison is BACK!! from the visual (new outfit) to new moves. This the best Bison in a long time.. 👏🏽 👏🏽
How much does M Bison cost in street fighter 6
This is actually the first time bison is dlc
Very useful video
1:21 GRIFFIIIIIIIITH!!!!!
The blue flame is actually from the hadoken he absorbed from Ryu in Street fughter V. He is struggling with the hado and Psycho power in this Street fighter Vi. Dont foget he also absorbed Nash's power in SFV. So that makes sense now.
Who else thinks of Raul when u see Bison
SF5  Bison might have been slow, but he had swag.
Why u choosing this gay ass stage
Just hope they eventually will bring back Vega, Balrog and Sagat. All them deserve to make a great comeback.
Me: "Oh sweet, M Bison is back!" Roofle: "Now Bison does remain a charge character." Me: *immediately checks out from ever playing Bison*
Prince Arthas !!! Why not a Frostmourne ?
M bison looks great
Lifelong Bison player here, SFV Bison was so bad I returned the game. Hope they dont let me down here.
Got my boy M.bison looking like he's on a watch list
Mained in SF4, instantly disliked him in SF5 due to how slow he moved around.
Great video! I am super curious tho, what is he like on modern controls?
his idle pose looks wack and his teleport dash is gone
not sure you will see this comment, but any weaknesses? Low hp? low damage?
I think he looks great I haven’t really messed with him since SF4 I look forward to him dropping def gonna play with him
What do you think of his new design?
He kinda look like ken
Move set looks weak.
I hope and pray that someone mods in the family guy version of the horse. For reference: https://youtu.be/kKWdaRf-2s8?si=3DTEUxX-Ty1OufMj&t=24
Projectile characters are f***ed…. Scissor kick is no longer charge??????? Sheesh
Bruh scissor kick not being full charge character is crazy so now i kniw if they bring balrog he wont be fully charge
“wEll rOOUUUFlemonger ill just fuzzy block it”  no you wont
Sf5 bison was deadly... regardless of walking speed... walking speed was never am issue
Dang 12:00 is crazy
''As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.

it's crazy how much you sound like @RJStheFourthAge
He actually plays a lot like SF4 Vega (my main in that game)! Fast walk speed, fast buttons, a slide (finally!), a charge button to make you fly all over and shitty anti air 😂 I'm super hyped to get my hands on him until Vega drops! Thanks for the video!
No psycho inferno? That’s one move I liked from his SFV iteration.
its so werid being able to see his irises. like we all remember his eys just being stark white with nothing else!
the things i would do to have urien back in the game
This is such a good video, glad I subscribed
It's been 22 years and I can still smell the fresh plastic of the cartridge 😂 I've longed to see an MK/SF crossover JUST to see how Shao Khan v M. Bison would look! EVEN IF THERE WAS NO (puke) FATALITIES (can't believe I just said that, but the suits at Capcom are too afraid to see SCORPION & SUB-ZERO KICK THE SHIT OUT OF RYU & KEN
No teleports?
I’m about to be sweating these boys out with bison
He lacks a Bisonica teleport'... 😢
Hahahahahah can we get more of that guy at home?😂
so hyped for bison, I was waiting for him
He's out??
Thanks! Nice vid' ;)
I really like his SF6 design. Reminds me of how much I love Sagat’s redesign in SF5
Enough of M. Bison, it is time for M. Horse!
hobo bison
Hope sf4 vega comes back
Weird as it sounds, Bison doesn’t seem to smile menacingly as much and I kind of like him better as a result???
My favoritecharge character is back, now witha different gimmick and way more flaverful
Honestly, I wasn't too impressed with the SF6 demo or the Yr 1 dlc. However, Year 2 definitely is making me give this game a second try.
I need someone to mod Bison as General Zod from Superman. 😂
SNK over the years always had the best character balance when it came to characters with no projectiles..    They always gave them something to do with them..  Nice to see Capcom doing this..  More fighting game should normalize non projectile characters deal with them a lot easier.
Hasn't Psycho Power been purple ever since Rose was established, starting after Alpha (in which i believe it WAS also blue), it was purple in 4, 5 and now 6. Purple power leaks out of Bison in one of his round wins and he converts it to blue, Ed also changes from purple to blue in this game, and JP has his own Psycho Power which is the usual purple and black.  I'm pretty sure Bison is using a form of soul power.
14 days left, before m.bison/vega has arrived in street fighter 6.
wtf is
Cadê aquele teleport clássico dele? De aproximação, pelas costas, e o golpe psycho da mão, sinceramente; e como fã  e joguei o 5 com ele tem algumas coisas que tiraram e vão fazer muita diferença e vai inferiorizar a jogabilidade dele contra vários adversários.
Bored of the charge to quarter circle changes
His forward walk once he takes a couple of steps look weird, like his waist isn't moving, so it looks like he is sneaking.
I feel his design is a love nod to Raoh from Fist of the North Star, judy get that vibe
5:06 nah that was funny af
I LOVE making the old head uncle lolcow Dale tier god cry in this game. I love it. The old head can’t combo to save his old head life LOL
Horse
They really turned M.Bison into a hobo
If Urien gets into the game and Headbutt or Chariot Tackle end up as motion inputs I might actually tickle somebod
Cool characters. I don’t want the motion inputs, though. Waiting for Urien.
Some of his animations look kinda wacky, but other than that, pretty cool stuff. And I like his new fit a lot
Rooflemonger is the best in the business of character breakdowns! Keep up the good work dude!!! 💪
(About the Scissor kick frame data) By the power of frame by frame on Computer + Youtube (the shortcut is , to go back 1 frame and . to go forward 1 frame) Scissor kick leaves Bison +1.
bison needs more smile on his face
They missed a trick not having the horse kick you as part of his level 3/CA.  He does look awesome but kinda sad they made scissors a motion input.
I would never cheat on E Honda... but maybe we could take a break :3
He looks old and busted like a zombie
I wonder where Hiro and SD PNoy and Tampa Bison are right now
his ca is so dramatically different from his lvl3 it actually looks like a proper super attack. i wish all the characters got this treatment for their cas instead of subtle changes.
Reminds me of War from the Darksiders video game.
Showcasing this on a Tuesday is perfect for M. Bison
Damn he has Ken's crazy kicks except, a jinrai punch. You're gonna have a lot of guessing to do
I wonder if we'll get another Giant Impact against Shin Bison.
Scissor kicks better be minus on block safe or not, if they're motion controls, it's going to be a huge problem if they're plus on block as well. 💀
Tbh, he looks like pain in the ass to fight. His EX headstomp is gonna piss me off so much when people start spamming it lmao.
Hey i wanna start playing bison more in sf6, played him a little in the end of sfv and loved the gameplay. Which character can i practice to be ready for his release?
Good. His Critical is WAAAY Better than Level 3
My 2nd pocket character is back wooo🎉
They have absolutely glazed this man and I love it.
Pressure pressure pressure, make you sweat all the time
oh so dont have that V skill 2 from sf5?
The sooner someone makes a mod that swaps the horse and bison the better
I can't wait for Mai she gonna make me Pick up sf6
best version of Bison to date
Is it just me or does his character model look a little smaller in comparison to Guile?   Anyways, they juiced him up so hard with this version of Bison. He is like a collection of the best tools of each version. From the fast speed of the classic design to the psycho mine of sf5 bison. They really buff a lot of his offense. His lack of traditional anti-airs & pesky fireballs were always been his weaknesses. But with these new changes to his psycho crusher & faster down fierce, he's a lot stronger dealing with his weaknesses.
Sorry if I missed it, but do we know if Bison's jump roundhouse is still a cross up?
Bison:  I created a monster... Coz nobody wants to see Bison no more... They want JP, I'm chopped liver...
Nobody is gonna talk about Bison turning into Papoose for his Lvl 3????????
Roof, does Bison have his teleports?
#Justice for Nash
You face the Mighty Bison!!!!! I'm happy Bison has some QCF and QCB inputs. Always liked him in SF4 but charge inputs were giving me trouble.
He should’ve been riding a bison.
Thank you for showing the critical art so early in the vid!!
Will there be an event for bison like there was for akuma? Maybe vs SiRN (shin) Bison
Cr. MK being drive rush cancelable is something I didn't see coming but I will take it
His overhead looks like the punch from CVS...I forgot if it's special or normal. Except it's a bit slower.
I noticed that bison has almost his classic stance like he did in sf 2, he shakes his hand more in sf2 though. Something about that physho power flowing through his hands maybe?
So we're finally getting Honda on the 28th nice.
If Bison is Back. I want Charlie Back too.
M.Bison...is....BAAAAAAAACK
He ought to have a better than Deejay DR, they took his teleport.  Was so fun to teleport mixups in USF4.
I think this is the same M. Bison we know but has lost his memory.
Also, whoever posted that Kim/Deejay knee press meme on Reddit is a loser.
He was super fun USF4.  Kinda meh in SFV.  Looks and sounds cool, and harkens back to World Warrior nostalgia!  🎉
Hood bison looks like war from Darksiders one which is still awesome cool I'm hyped Darksiders game great franchise looking forward too Darksiders 4 and 5 Tony dandrigde Augusta ga big love hero love aligned with God bvs trill one real one day one
Two videos and in your energy already has me subscribing
M Bison is the first character who looks worse than his sf5 version. Capcom is still capcom.😅
Hell yeah
Crazy that they took him from one of the slowest characters with weak anti-projectile in 5 to literally the fastest in 6 (Akuma walkspeed but his dash covers more ground and his drive rush is faster) with some of the best anti projectile tools in the game with his fullscreen air approach options and psycho crusher beating regular fireballs on reaction meterlessly, while EX crusher seems to be basically Cammy level 3 with less damage but safer on block (unless they have the mine on and you have 3 meters, then it’s Cammy level 3 that does more damage, but you only spend the super meter on hit and it’s safe on block or even plus on Block depending on range). Not that he even really needs that now since his version of the universal “walk forward, parry fireball, walk forward, parry fireball, drive rush out of the parry” anti-fireball option is the best in the game because of his mobility anyway.  Edit: forgot about his level 2, which also looks like another very strong projectile punish, so in the case that you are burned out and they use a fireball with multiple hits you have that option too. Actually I think overall he has the second best anti-projectile in the game and definitely the best of a character without a fireball of their own. (Dhalsim is the best overall imo, though he doesn’t really come to mind because he’s a zoner himself, mainly because of float, teleport, and his normals).
So they changed some of his moves to motion instead of charge, but couldn't do the same for Gief instead of his circles...
He actually looks fun this time around. Love the cash out od psycho crusher on the mine.
I'm so freaking glad that M Bison is back , psycho crusher 🔥🔥🔥🔥
How can you look at that thumbnail and think the new design looks better than the classic? Classic makes him look like such a menace! Almost Zombie-fied.
Capcom is so fucking random with their character designs. They took a dictator, made him homeless with amnesia and just gave him a horse because why tf not 💀💀 I’m all for it though, shits hard
Glad he has that unique grounded anti-air weakness. And it really is unique now that Aki got all those anti-air buffs. Even Marisa has gladius armor and air invincible dimachaerus (though that move is mostly for combos, gladius or c.HP is usually a better idea, though similar to Bison, if you are on the ball enough to land it you get big damage) I’m glad because he seems kind of insane otherwise, just having the best walkspeed, fast long range dash, and one of if not the fastest drive rush, plus multiple air approach options is crazy on its own for offense, defense and mental stack. Plus the rest of his moveset seems good-great as well. Definitely needs at least one big weakness lol. I hope it’s enough.
double knee press being a motion is a major failure  i am writing my senator about this i cant belive this
So he became a Darksiders character after 5? Cool.
Bison low key looks like shirtless War from Darksiders. Both on horses too.
I *just* started to learn Guile and Ryu, now here comes Bison to compete for my attention. He looks so fun.
My boy ghostchips about to cook
FIRE
He looks dope. Won’t be buying tho. Sucks he’s a charge character. Those are the death of me. Glad they didn’t do Ed and Akuma like that.
He looks really fun. I try out all the dlc characters but I feel like I might end up spending more time with him than a few of the others
love Bison and how he looks but I'm not gonna lie that shit gotta go asap
How is he on modern?
People aren't talking about the blue flames of the Psycho Crusher, but the blue-ish green one seen in his Round Win animations in the trailer, especially when Psycho Power threatens to explode out his bad arm, like he's 'healing' it.
have you try the combo trial??
Can he no longer teleport?
I love the fact they are coming back to the roots of the characters after the false step of SF5
Thinking i might main Baizen, never played him in any other version of the game. but he looks insane in this one
This is the coolest Bison have ever looked. I probably still won’t play him, but this is the first time I’ve ever been interested in him as a character.
Guile in the background watching Bison fight himself: “Damn these Tuesday flashbacks are intense…”
I will be playing Bison. I always liked him and the fact they gave him the horse and just made him Raul Julia (AKA The definitive Bison) means I will be maining him now more than ever before.
He looks like the true reincarnation of bison now remastering his psycho power that's y probably he doesn't teleport.. AS yet maybe in SF7 they will make him into the final BOSS he once was
Video popping off you deserve the love!
i appreciate your content. as a tekken player, your videos keep me in the loop with all of the sick new things going on the fgc right now. thank you!
Omg!   Anyone notice the color alt  Turquoise light green with copper metal, wasn’t that the sega street fighter 2 champion or turbo edition color
Literally fucking why change charge moves? To appease casuals? I don't fucking get it.
Akuma vs Bison fights are going to be insane…this game made street fighters powerful af
He looks awesome, even more so in his classic costume. Such a bummer they couldn't do the same for Akuma.
5:50 Goes to show, hăving access to good tools is only a bad thing when you're a designated joke character.
I played some rounds of chess today and whenever I moved a knight I said "Psycho crusher"
Does his level 3 go full screen?
I’m going to call this version of Bison “Old Spice” look away for 2 seconds and that mans on a horse 😭😭
Maybe bison’s a good guy now that he has a pet
I'm convinced they don't know how to build in game mechanics that can work with both motion and charge so they just opted to slowly kill off charge options instead. Shame I really like that style of characters
They really gave Bison a demon flip.
I don’t full grasp the charge system, will that be a big problem playing Bison?
Damn the boy is fast
Normally, you could hold me at gunpoint and I still would not pick up a charge character. I am willing to learn however if I get a horse in the process.
What are situations where you would rather do regular head stomp than devil reverse?
This is absolutely my favorite character now
i prayed for bison when this game came out. ive been switching mains every couple weeks, just cant find a good fit. bison has been my main in every sf game to date. so glad hes actually here!!! cant wait
Am I the only one disappointed that his teleport didn't make it back....
Bro think he is Starscourge Radahn get off the horse bro😭🙏
He looks like a really fun and strong character. Love the fact that we get Psycho Crusher back as an on demand special again too. Can't wait to lab some of those Psycho Mine combos.
I wish they announced the release date in the Year 2 trailer instead of in the comment of this video. Also 6/26 is VERY close to Akuma's release, not even a month later. I hope this means Terry comes out closer to August/September and not November.
Jesus making his scissor kick quarter Circle takes him from unplayable to main character for me
When you said "for those who don't like sf5 bison but enjoy sf4 bison, this character is for you" I was instantly sold. My main is back and ready to psycho kick some ass!
Never cared for bison but this incarnation looks cool enough for me to finally learn how to charge partition.
So glad he’s closer to cvs2/4 bison I look hella forward to learning this character again
Bison looks "correct" and suitably scary for the SF6 roster. Very well done at first blush, can't wait to incorporate some of his kit into an Avatar.
Today was the day that we got sone info on Bison.  But for Bison, it was Tuesday.
So glad to see they went with classic Bison movement speed. We are so back!
"Rooflemonger I'll just fuzzy guard." "No, you won't shut up"  was the funniest thing I've heard in a while lmfao
I can’t believe I’m saying this. But M Bison in this game actually looks insane. I wanna try him. Can’t say I’ll main him but now I’m intrigued.
Nice video to see on a Tuesday
The horse is a cit. from Raoul of Hokuto no Ken
I notice they made the visual design of his Psycho Power deliberately asymmetric in some ways.  On the select screen, he's looking at his right hand regardless of which side he's on.  He charges his Psycho Crusher specifically with his back hand only (right hand on P1 side), as well as his Level 3 in the startup animation.  And they even specifically didn't mirror the taunt where he punches you with his Psycho-powered right hand.  Interesting...  They do something similar with JP's Psycho Power in his right hand (hidden by his cloak).  Are they trying to say something with that?  Like maybe each character has taken half the power or something?
dude just has a damn horse chillin💀
Tattered dictator is back
But does Devil's Reverse have cross-up properties again though?
I can't commend them enough for how capcom has handled the *gameplay* aspects of sf6.
No alt Color’s for horse?? 🥺
That waving hand animation when he stands in place is no good, can’t stop staring that, it’s awful
Problem x will be a real problem 😂
Does the M in M Bison refer to modern ?
Ok, now I want Sagat back badly 🤣🤣 Well, and Feilong, Makoto, maybe Nash even... Or Eagle 😝
...what the fuck has happened to Street Fighter...😢
How much are the characters to unlock?
Now introducing horse ft. Body manipulated bison
I loved him in SFV. It was my first proper fighting game and an introduction to Street Fighter, so I guess there’s a bias. I think his intimidating stance and animations are amazing there. However, I’m still happy for the people who wanted him to be a more “original” self from previous games. Bison is back — it’s all that matters
boss is back
Its shameful how this game favors Luke at times. A normal punch stoping Bisons over the head EX is just and ass move. 😂😂😂 and it was hilarious watch Bison vs Akuma in sf6 and Bison tells Akuma "there's nowhere to run"... bruh who was running, us standing on ur grave.
05:06 PLEASE LMAO you aint have to cook em like that 😂😂
You’re the goat!!!!!
All my homies hate sf5 bison
You say its not Soul Power, but it could be the power of Nothingness.  Maybe some of Ryu's peanut butter got mixed into Bison's chocolate when he blew up?
Another great video!
Bison looks homeless
You have unique intonation
Roaster suddenly got healthy but buff Akuma
M.Bison is just ken from the future
"Are you a different animal and the same beast?"
I watched 2 secs and i find your voice annoyying
Imagine the horse trusting his "psycho crusher" on you.
5:10 invisible super lol always my go to for getting mixed lol he looks good, was thinking whos the guy on the left side when i saw the thumbnail, his mine looks familiar....  like with aki they took testaments mechanic n mixed it up, i do love mechanics like that tho  been loving the aki buffs tho i wish they made bubble faster recovery
Is bison controlling sagat body or was that a lie
1:20 "wait, HOW MUCH DO YOU WEIGHT?!"
Bison>JP as he should always be
0:41 the "Look at my horse" meme must return!  XD
5:05 lol
Do you think that we could become M Bison's student if he spawns in World Tour?
Look at his horse his horse is a amazing give it a lick.
He looks DAMN FUN! Might be his best version yet, even though I really enjoy his SFV appearance!
Can't wait to hide this game away from my horse-obsessed nieces...
And of course it's Tuesday. Serendipity at its finest
SF6 players: "fuck this guy and the horse he rode in on"
Is his stand jab his 4 frame?
"Anything is possible when you have PSYCHO POWER. I'm on a horse." Psycho Power: Smell Like You Rule The World
didnt know richard nixon watches rooflemonger
Why did Lily get lame 'buffs'
Hahahahah yoo always loved your videos but your joke bout fuzzy guard at 5:03 had me dying so hard. Please be more loose and make more jokes like that. Great video as always man.
Can't wait to see Prob X use this character
Those honda buffs aren't looking so hot after seeing this dude in action lol
HOLY SHIIIIIET!!!!! He’s delicious!!!!
Finally another charge input character!
I don't know why I find it funny that Bison has a bunch of "air shenanigans" and at the same time he doesn't have particularly good anti-air. He can exploit his own weakness.
If this continues that way, we can hope that at the time SF7 gets released there are no charge characters anymore, just motion inputs, as god intended.  Spot booing, you charged up freaks, I just don't like charge inputs... ^^  Other than that Bison looks amazing, beeing dead and having lost his memory really did him well. I was never quite interested in Bison but since they didn't buff the young Psycho Power user. And Bison even has several overheads, that's great, this zombie indeed is quite interesting.
cool that he always plants the mine with his psycho arm, regardless of which direction he's facing
I like to believe the M in M. Bison stands for "Mario"
Not only did they waste one of our four slots on Bison, but he's going to be the most annoying version ever.
biggest problem where is his outfit 2 cape????????
5:05  You got quite the laughs out of me for that one, I almost spit out my food that I was eating hahaha.
Its Tuesday.
Bison's win animation should have had him chasing you down in that truck he drove in the Street Fighter 2 animated movie 😆
Lol Bison ex PC pass thought fireballs with no punish unlike Honda ex SH that get slower and lose temporal health
Bison’s CA standing on the arm after a whiff is hilarious, dude is confused where Bison went and bam he is standing on your whole arm, looking down on you & arms crossed. LOL
Brilliant video.  Thanks for the detailed  move set . Bison looks awesome. I'm looking forward to M Bison and  Mai .
Bison looks like a zombie in this game
The horse is a bit much
The Psycho Crusher should've always went through projectiles! That's dope it does this time!
Having a horse made bison rediscover his passion for speed
Did you have a peak at his MODERN version ?
Excellent usage of your time there ! We lzarned a lot about this new Bison. I was worried he would have slow walkspeed. Now, I'm pretty happy about all of this !
Im really gonna miss his inferno move and the cross up dash and teleports 😢 but I guess since hes so fast on the ground they didn't feel the need to give it to him
>See local tournament >look at rules "No horseplay"  Damn, they banned my boy already
M.Bison killed Raoh and took his horse. So he knows he's invincible now with the Hokuto no psycho power.
He I going to be a problem 😮
I'm from the real world it's great to see that Vega is back
This character has everything!
"The explosion is an interesting mechanic!" Brother that is literally just Testament's Stain from GGST.
"It remains an overhead when you do it as a target combo"   Good grief, what is this, Mortal Kombat?
Do we have a date?..To remind me when to not go online.
Bison gonna be mad cheap, and i think he gonna dunk on JP to boot lmao. Look forward to his release.
What the horse doin???
"Undying Desire" huh, really interesting.
Bison stole Testament's Strive Stain, love it(Yeah, idgf about his V-trigger 2I
Now that M. Bison is coming to the game. It pretty much confirms a thought of mine. SF6 is basically an updated SF2 with new characters. They even got Lili in place of T. Hawk.
Finally, Madison Bipson is back.
Even in his old age bison still disrespectful and I love the new psycho crusher especially the nuke version
Talk about a big difference between normal level 3 and critical. That said he reminds me of how SF5 made Nash look cool to me this does interest me a bit.
Bison gives me huge Alex or Abel vibes
His gameplay reminds me of CVS2 Bison which is very exciting
Imagine if he could call in the horse like R. Mika calls in Nadeshiko.
The fact that Bison stands on your fist is disrespect but then again, Akuma grabs your face and throws you to the ground lol
Great another busted character... Great job Capcom 🖕🖕🖕🖕
Don't yell at Bison. You might go horse.
I don't play Bison but im glad he's here. I want to see Balrog get added to the roster too. Street Fighter 6 is coming along nicely
HE LOOK AND PLAY AND SOUNDS SO BADASS. INSTANT BUY. I HOPE MAI IS JUST AS WELL DESIGN.  😍
Ex devil reverse was the best move in SFV imo, so definitely some ptsd there 😅
"I'm on a horse. " - M. Bison
Fast Bison is back!
This is the Bison that takes out Akuma before the final boss battle begins😅
Man you are great bro but you gotta kill the up speak please I beg you 👈
Amazing Bison Video 🕹️ Now I’m interested in learning him.
This is the best bison I have seen in years. Wow.😮 The super you shown in the beginning of the video, wasn't shown in the trailer.  😭 It's so freaking amazing
Peta, da horse is here!
Bison's Chin got quite a buff and good reach.
When is release date?
his third costume better be Raul Julia's robe or I'll riot
5:56 holy shit that dash is absurd!! His movement is insane this time around
They ruined bison. Motion is gay
I love Bison's new backstory in this game.
1:21-1:33 *Now I know why it's called UNLIMITED Psycho Crusher...!* 😮
Can't believe they gave Gill's retribution to Bison. I'm gonna have so much fun playing him
Cool thing we got Bison included with the Horse DLC
The horse should be in the background during the fight, waiting for Bison to return
They gave him an overhead. They gave me another reason to hate this character.
They need to bring back the jerking it idle pose D: They try by having him wave his hand a bit :P
Isn't Bison supposed to have a teleport? I'm pretty sure he could teleport in 4
I like psycho crushers as much as the next guy, but that devil's reverse with the followup looks like poetry in motion.
“Bizon…” anyway great breakdown! Thanks for the info! That walk speed was unexpected.
Where is Bison's teleport move????
I feel like Bison's become a final boss again.  Weird because I'm not even sure he is the real Bison!
Quality Content! 😎👍
He should have been able to throw horse
Bison looks pretty cool  with his new outfit
Problem X rubbing his hands like bird man right now.
When are they going to fix Ken's run that always comes out lol :) ... Bison looks sick
Why are they releasing characters so soon all of a sudden?
He might actually be the best character in the game like why the hell is he as fast as akuma 😭😭 (the shoto meta is over 😭😭😭)
He should be able to call in the horse for a OTG hoof stomp 😂
They changed the look of the burnout gauge, there might be more balance changes on that patch
I believe the horse has STAND powers.
It just feels like the new characters are basic compared to the returning cast and DLC
Minor question, what's up input-wise with his classic slide versus his new sweep?
We return to bisonopolis on the 26th ladies and gentlemen.
Why is he releasing on a Wednesday though
While I'm happy we got a new DLC character so soon after the last one, it's also a little worrisome if Capcom has now entered the pay-to-win phase of SF6, where the new characters will have super walkspeed and long normals and easy combo opportunities, while the base characters are just... worse.
Man, his hand gestures are super distracting and weird to look at
Bison overhead and speedy is insane 😂
Wow... I like what I see.. Play Ed now but I definitely wanna learn Bison
HE HAS A DIO COLOR I'M SOLD
Wish they gave him a projectile.
oh my gosh they made his stupid standing pose from all the older games actually look... tough. He looks poised to strike or defend, instead of fidgeting around. Huge buff.
Damage output seems a little low to me
thank you roof for showing us bison in and out, i'm SUPERRRRRRRRRR happy he's a fast walk speed boi again. he was my OG main next to chun in SFIV and was very to play, in 6 not only does he look sick AF again...he looks fun to play again as well!!! can't wait to psycho crusher people to death again, it'll be like old times
Anyone else notice how C2 bisons hand is constantly fidgeting? Any thoughts on that?
His hand animation is so cool
This might be wishful thinking but now that Scissor Kick is a motion input is it possible that it could be used as an unorthodox anti-air? Or perhaps as a way to cross under someone trying to jump attack you?
NapoBison is doooooope
Hells yeah, BIPSON is back!
Infact bison look like peter falk
Now is master of evil 2or 4 days ago I saw the titles Bison is not evil
I’m not a fan of horses in my fighting games idk why
Great overview! Thanks!
Guile was in the back like.... "That better be cosplay!!"
Arthas from frozen throne😂
Does he have his SFII costume? For the sake of nostalgia?
I can’t wait to *horse around* with M. Bison when he comes out
I figured he wasn't entirely a charge character since all the other characters are also the same they have some charged moves but not entirely and it made sense and specially because in the trailer we can see that he is not charging those moves.
Wasn't T.Hawk your SF2 main? 🤔
I loved playing him in SF2:CE and his look in CvS2. I'm happy, can't wait.
some animations on classic Bison are so weirds
some MASTER ASIA type of shi
Dude....that's a real move name. Bison has attacks like Devil's Reverse, Shadow Rise, Psycho Crusher and I get Double Knee Press and  Head Press doesn't necessarily follow the name scheme but BACKFIST COMBO? That's the name they went with?
Plot twist: the horse is the real M. Bison.
My fucking Hero. Thank you for this upload! Never been happier as a Bison fan, Bison main, and legacy Street Fighter player. I can literally feel every button press from watching you, and I can tell this is the Bison we needed. The latter half of this year will be the year of The Dictator. 🗿
M bison  looks epic especially that pose from sf2 capcom has to release like an arcade edition that has year 1 and 2 respectively right away before 2024 flies or if not by the end of 2024 at least maybe early next year but I'll be waiting.
I'm on the fence with the scissor kick being an input command vs. charge. I suppose it'll make it easier on the joystick to only charge half as much lol
CVS 2 Dictator A Grove > All other Dictators
Rooflemonger the goat
His flesh looks horrible I love it
Gouki > Dictator
I love how the Street Fighter 6 system allows for most of the legacy characters to be the best or most aggressive version of themselves.
In SF5, the Horse would be his VTrigger, like Nadeshko 🤔
he sounds almost exactly like Honda but with a different flavor which is great IMO
Disappointed that the horse doesn't have colors that would have been so sick
Does he has a throw loop?
Bye-sin not Bye-zen…
Thank you for showing all the colors. Costume 1 is for me definitely.
Meister Rooflemonger. Some questions please:  1. Any invincible special moves? 2. Are the scissor kicks safe?  3. Does his st. HK whiff on crouchers? 4. Is the mine planting punch safe on block?  Thanks again, you are a true gentleman and a devout scholar.
Rooflemonger you are awesome man.
Street Fighter 5 never happened in my head cannon
Coconut Someone Walked Upon Ah!
Perfeito ❤
5:28 no way this game doesn’t even have that wth?  Kinda sad how mk11 seems to be the last fighting game that was released as a full game 😂
BIG MAN BISON COMING FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HES COMING HES COMING
Goated showcase
I got a feeling that M. Bison isn’t even evil in 6. A lot of his moves have soul power instead of psycho power and it might be that he’s more neutral evil than actively trying to do evil as he usually does
I didn’t even know people get early access like this?!!!
He be looking like Gary Busey 😂
Ah yes, an M.Bison analysis on a Tuesday. Just as fate intended.
Oh wow look another character that can deal with Projectiles better than Juri 😂😂
Did you manage to test if stHK was a good anti-air?  Cause that button was a godlike one-button fast way to snipe people jumping back in SF4
Definitely rocking the outfit 9 milk man fit
Capcom please just give Ed one overhead 😭
he looks awesome, stoked to finally have a second character after Gief
Thanks for this man
I think the horse is there to show he can’t hover anymore? Maybe some story there.
The alt costume colors look really good
youtube is crazy 67 views on a 2 hour video uploaded less than 10 min ago....
Likely an unpopular opinion but I really liked Bison in sf5. He felt menacing when he was walking up on you. And it gave him the feel that he doesn't need to be in a hurry to kill you or this fight is beneath him. And his teleport dash added to that. Why waste energy dashing when I can just teleport? While this Bison is cool, I think they lost that narcissistic personality that 5 gave him.
So, a horse enters a bar... Damn capcom took the memes to the next level!
Gets murdered by Ryu with the big Shinku Hadoken, comes back with projectile invuln crusher. Lore accurate.
In rooflemonger we trust 🗣️   I honestly didn’t think things would go this well at the summer games fest. Thank you so much rooflemonger
I liked the jacked dictator look. Not so much the mid east hobo...
M.Bison HYPE
I want his theme music
I am SO glad he has his bullshit normals back!!
they really said "we paid for the whole horse, we are using the whole horse"
Oh, this is all exciting to hear.  I think he looks like a lot of fun, I've not played Bison before but I feel willing to commit the time to learn how to play him in 6.
Holy smoks,he is faster than the akuma
"But for me, it was Tuesday" Literally lol ...Well played Capcom and Roof 🔥🐎🔥
Bison fans won
Bipson is SO back
In my head cannon the horse's name is "Tuesday".
I like that rooflemonger went straight to showing us CA lvl 3. Good job reading your audience.
You forgot aerials normals 😢
Good work . Appreciate your work 👍
Bison looks like sick. def buying him when its released
It's just me or that CA is really long?
This video sold me S2 pass! 😀
Bison used the air flaming torpedo on T Hawk in the comics.
its crazy how we just got akuma and now we get a horse
Street Fighter Alpha Bison was the worst version of him.
I am so happy he is in this game. I only liked Lily in this game. Juri is a character I have always loved, but in this game, she is boring. This version of Bison looks so good. Like you and many others, I didn't gel with SFV Bison.
Can't this Mf stay dead of once?
Yes M Bison riding his horse for his walkout it's awesome
Look forward to trying him and also seeing Problem X try him 😉
the longest normal is still juri HK i think
Fastest walk speed unless against Kim
This Bison is the most blatant Hokuto no Ken reference ever and I do like that.
Lord Bison is da boss.🧑‍✈️
What about his Crouching HK (Slide or Sweep)
He looks pretty Cool. Can't wait to try him out.
you be putting out high level videos..Good job bro!
97 year old street fighter villain no longer has to open you up the old fashioned way.
For the fancy colors!
but for me, it was tuesday
Aren't you the guy that also fixes up watches?
The end of match cutscenes or victory screens with M. Bison are going to be very interesting. Still, I am more excited for Terry and Mai to come out but this is a great character to have in the meantime. :)
That horse needs to be in the character select animation, so it doesn't give you whiplash when it's suddenly strutting through the walkway with Bison mounted on it.
That Bison Akuma overlay is terrifying…
Ken's halloween costume
does sf6 got like fight money currency to buy characters?
Please tell me he’s +150 on every normal like in 5 ?
I like how he doesn’t get off his horse even when he’s indoors
The critical is kinda lame , worse than his level 2  I still like his super from sfv more
i really wanna play SF6 but all i have is a ps5 controller and it just sucks, i wanna learn classic but its no fun with the controller i have
I was not expecting this at 5:05
I have named the horse Tuesday. H.Bison was a close second but it's Tuesday.
M Bison 🦬  riding a M Horse 🐎
When people said that M. Bison kept his teleport abilities, I thought they referring to his horse lol
ima gonna be a bison boy
Oh my god dont tell me they remove his disapear and reappear from the other side ? Because i dont see it
My main is back, I just need Ibuki now.
someone send this to punk, he  said bison look slow
Did anyone notice when you're in CA health range with a level 3 the health bar flashes yellow?  That's new right? 1:14 & 17:57 before the CA comes out the health bar is flashing.
And you did uploaded this....on a Tuesday 😂
does he kinda look like a zombie or it's just me
Can he combo with the detonation after a throw?
I want to see hotdog play this character
He won't be popular because he wont be carried by fireball dr
I fell in love with SF5 Bison simply bc of Zhens play at the last Capcom Cup for SF5 Cant wait for dude to get his hands on this version.
Good news sinc he is a charge character the akuma abusing scrubs wont pick him! Yes before you ask i have been hurt
Did you happen to see how mine worked on DI?
SF6 might be the first SF that I will main Bison.
Still wanna know why the dual color flames that switch back and forth, and why he seems to be “fighting” them internally.
That's not a horse. It's Torrent, the spectral Steed.  When Bison died, he found himself resurrected in the lands between.
What I would like to know is if EX Scissors or EX Psycho Crusher can be used as a reversals.
Bison was better in 5😂
Oh man, I was hoping he would go Charlie Nash SFV where he turns into full motion character, guess not. Enjoy Bison mains
I guess im the only 1 that misses the teleport dash and projectiles?
He looks incredible! I can’t wait to play him
Seeing that standard medium kick is enough to bring a tear to the eye of any man
Did you try out modern controls, any idea what moves he loses? I’m curious if he keeps the overhead and overhead-low target combo.
Wonderfull my main is back I will start playing SF6 more often 😊
i do question whether the blue stuff is simply bc of classic bison psycho power: they very specifically show him trying to hold it back and turning it into purple energy like whats contemporary with psycho power nowadays, let alone the fact that only some moves use it; could either call back to him being fucked up by the power of nothingness in V; maybe its old bisons soul screaming to be set free deep inside this insominac bisons body? its hard to say but theres certainly some story intent behind him having both purple and blue energy instead of just one or the other
Spooky dash
Gotta suck to be one of the 450 Dolls created as a potential host body for Bison and then see that he's just back in his regular old one
Yes!! There is no back charge, foward , back foward super input
WHOOOAAAA
this bison kinda reminds me of havik where you kind have to whiff punish for combos
Never been a fan of Bison but I gotta admit the lore and his playstyle looks hella good 👍
OH MY GOD HE WAITED FOR TUESDAY TO UPLOAD THIS
I wish they had his revised SFV costume, it wasn't very different from his OG costume but the longer coat just made him look so much cooler  I also miss his upright stance, the SF2 one always looked goofy af to me lol, it does look very good on his new design tho, on the nostalgia one... no so much
SF6 Capcom the kinda team to make a 3rd Attack Button to give a character 3 different Quarter Circle Forward Button Specials before they give a Charge Character a Back Forward Punch and Back Forward Kick.  Remy's Low Boom gonna be a Quarter Circle while Regular Boom is a Charge.
Loving this. He’s old school sfv/CVS2 bison. I’m  definitely to main him. Until c.viper drops🙌🏽
Sf5 bison have the Best dash
I'm betting he's dead but the psycho energy is controlling the body.
Oh also is knee press/scissor kick safe on block? And if it is, Does it require the right spacing?
Wow he seems super fun and interesting, looking forward to trying him out
Problem X is gonna be a problem 😂
I don't like his stand or walk animations. Looks weird and doesn't fit his style.
I believe Capcom Modeled this version of Bison off of Raoh from Fist of the North Star. Especially with the horse..
I miss his SFV idle pose. Standing there with his arms crossed, menacingly.
The only thing I don't like is how he stands (like he shit his pants) would prefer if he had his SF5 pose.
surprised psycho crusher isnt a punish counter on block
I just got off of SF6, but I'll go into a few more since you were so kind.
kinda sad he doesnt have a 3rd level 3 like Akuma, was hoping thatd be the new thing for the dlc characters going forward and then theyd give everyone a 3rd level 3 in season 3 or "Arcade Edition"
For us Bison enjoyers, it was the most important day of our lives.   But for Rooflemonger? It was Tuesday.
I love how his likes are just so plain and simple to the notion of just about every tyrannical world-craving dictator ever. Like for Power! Dislike for Incompetence!  No subtlety for Bison, heh. Thank you for showing this, I do love how absurd his expressions and entrances are.
5:09 “Shut up! Ok?”  lol I don’t think I’ve ever seen this level of aggression from Rooflemonger 😂   Great video as always. Only wish we could have seen that CA in full speed 😎
I know that DI is not the demon it was but I still feel like some of M.Bison's normals look very slow on start up. In your opinion will DI or perfect parry for that matter pose a problem when it comes to applying pressure with normals?
Dropping honda for bison
Whts up with his hand lol
I'm joining the war against Akuma on the side of Bison 🫡
Bison looks like that big chin hand over shoulder meme.
That walk speed is going to give nightmares
Thanks for confirming basically right from the start that he's not SF5 Bison. Bison is my SF4 main and I hated the slow Bison in SF5.
As someone who’s weakest game is sf compared to mk and Granblue I hope we get an Easy or at least another medium difficulty use character. All of them have been hard except akuma
Nobody Roofie: " Bye Zun "
I’m gonna miss dash teleport, but bison is looking sick.
Cant believe hes coming out so soon
ELENA HYPE
Dude is basically raoh with that horse now
Jesus... and I thought Akuma looked scary 😅
Thanks goodness capcom didn't listen to the internet on not wanting bison. the dude is way to iconic to not be in street fighter. I remember thinking when they drops sf3 and excluded bison and guile it was lame. Its weird dude, nobody ever complains about tekken and MK bring all their characters back, but for some reason people hate the idea of sf characters returning.
Not a fan of Knee press/scissor kick not being a charge, but if we take the vs games as part of his legacy it wouldn't be the first time, besides everything else sounds great.
@rooflemonger Great video btw. Any idea if he still has the jump heavy superman punch
Bison looks very promising, given what is shown so far shown with both his tools and how he behaves with SF6's universal mechanics, as well as his track record in recent Street Fighter games (very good in USF4, top tier in SFV).
Bison really wants you to know that he loves his horse and would take it anywhere.  Can you imagine if Rashid’s plane stage returned in SF6? Bison just casually parks his horse in the wing.
they sure do love the Character takes a swing at player doing CA bit huh
The best part is that this video released on Tuesday.
I'm so pumped to have my boy back. I have a Bison in every game he's in. My Bison may not be great in the game, but im gonna try because I love him so much. This new design is GOD TIER
I love characters who have a critical art that is specifically there just to show the other player how weak they are. Popping a super and having the opponent forced to try and take a swing and then take the L instead is absolutely glorious to me.
So awesome! This will finally get me back into street foghter 6. Was waiting for an old main.
This is where in season 2. HSDM will look completely different from jump instead of just ending with more emphasis or a add on attack. The newer characters will push the mechanics in a way season 1 characters can’t.
OH BOY THE HORSE APPEARS IN THE SELECT SCREAM AND YOU HIDE IT IN THE INTRO? PERFECT
Ryu, the horse is here
10:10 did they change the burnout bar to make it easier to see when it refills?
Is it just me or does the audio desync slightly near the end of the video?
I love u rooflemonger ❤
Is it me or does the Drive bar look slightly different in when in burn out?
I'm wondering if Ryu did the Power of Nothingness on M.Bison at the SFV and sealed some of his evil psycho power away and that's why he doesn't remember who he is?   He's still looks evil but he sure isn't M.Bison from the past personality wise from the trailer.
That CA is hilarious! 😂
Content drought, when?
He looks super awesome. SF6 is pretty much the first SF I've sunk any real time into and I'm really looking forward to getting my hands on Bison more than any other DLC character so far
3:48 bison is not the only one with charge moves. Guile, Dee jay, blanka, Honda and chun li are charge characters but not all inputs are charged some of them are motion too. For example Dee jay sobat kick was charge but in here is motion
THE WALKSPEED
No teleport ?
They should get rid of the "ease of use" on the character select screen. It's misleading for a beginner like me who finds a character like Ed to be easier to play than Marisa. Im only a bronze player so idk if better players think the same way.
As far as pokes go that heavy punch is definitely long range, but akis crouching heavy punch goes a bit further i think
Radahn vibes with horsey
Picking up a pocket Bison for sure.
So Ed remains the only character with no overhead
Reminds me a lot of sf2st bison.  Poor defensive options, but good pokes and fun combos.  He would be in trouble if he was a season 1 character.  I can't wait to play him.
It took them 30 years but they finally combined stomp and reverse.
I love that the first things you show are colors and CA. A man of the people
I like slow bison. Idk why but slow walkspeed with fast burst movement from specials or dash is really cool to me. Kinda like makoto
As a Marisa main, this may actually be the first DLC I end up picking up!
The CA reminds me of the Alpha 3 Boss Bison Psycho Crusher
Are his scisor kicks safe on block? Is his psycho mine back fist safe on block?
Bison needs a secret super art where the horse joins in, Mika style. lol
@5:05 lol shutdown every battle hub lobby chat lol😆
wtf is wrong with his hand
Never forget that Bison braids the mane of his horse
Kinda dissapointed he doesnt have his cape. At least intro with the cape and have him throw it off before the fight
Omfg that walk and dash speed is beautiful compare to the slow ass SFV version.
YEESSS
Passionate Pink Bison is back, baby
I hope Bison's horse and Dhalsim's elephant get along well.
Looking forward to your starter guide!
I miss that psycho crusher crossup
First thing tried is walk speed and stand MK. The true old school bison player knows.
"he got good walk speed" me: YES ! YES !
Somehow, Bison returned.   But in all seriousness, I’m super glad you’ve been getting more media opportunities and chances to check stuff out!! Thanks for another great video
Just casually cycling through both costumes colors in your intro, you truly are the peoples champion
Its Tuesday. I see what you did there.
That purple & platinum/silver classic costume looks siiiick.
Somehow M bison returned
It's so nice to see classic Bison back but with the touch of his old vt2 with that bomb thing. This will be fun...
So Bison now has Green Hand ... (sigh)
I love the reference to SF ex plus a, with hes lv1
Even the horse is in the walkout. What the hell? Nakayama really loves Raul Julia
That thumbnail is a jump scare damn they made him look gnarly haha
I do like that he's fast now and he's based on his classic form, but I miss his inferno 😢
Peetah, the horse is here
Oh, my. M. Bison's eyes are different as new, but...   I think Bison's lost his memory that he goes from success to failure. Like he had his amnesia for now though. I'm not a fan of M. Bison, but! I'll try to buy on Wednesday before next year with Elena! I'm a fan of her though.😁😁
As someone who prefers charge inputs to regular motions, it's frustrating to watch the slow eradication of charge inputs. I'm still going to play Bison (I also skipped him in V because of his atrocious walk speed), because at least he is hybrid, but we're down to basically Guile as a full charge character and even he isn't full charge any more.  Zero charge moves in S1 characters and even when a charge character like Bison does show up, I'm now routinely expecting one or more of their charge moves to be changed to motions.  At least Bison didn't get the full SFV Vega treatment.
But when he was slow Bison that archetype won an Evo. Make people play archetypes and stop letting people say how the archetype should play.
Please god why the walk speed and dash. Well boys prepare for throw loops
Did you test Psycho Mine > Throw > Explosion Juggle ? He seems to have "Vortex Potential"
He needs a skincare routine
No Modern footage?
Now we need Rose and Menat so they can explain what is going on with this Bison stuff
Bison lookin like a boss
The day Rooflemonger graced our YouTube notifications is the most important day of our lives but for Rooflemonger it was Tuesday
M.Bison needs a Raoh skin from Fist of the North Star.
Ha Ha  Love his tattered cape outfit ！
Isn't  it crazy? "a Bison riding a Horse"
He looks so cool. Unexpected.
Honestly, I'm feeling kind of disappointed. His moveset seems really barren, like he needs at least one or two more specials, ain't no way Blanka or Dee Jay have more specials than Bison in this game. Not even a teleport. SF5 took it out because his dash was now a teleport, now his dash is normal and he has no teleport at all in his moveset. His scissors aren't charge just as I feared (modern can't support two charge moves with the same input), no cross up psycho crushers (about as cringe as removing kara demon I'll say). A lot of the sauce is gone and it falls to Psycho Mine setups to make up for it.  When SF6 was coming out people were praising how "this game has the coolest versions of all returning characters". This just feels like a neat version of Bison, not definitive like every other character.  I'm probably overreacting and will be proven wrong when he releases and I get my hands on him tho lol. Still believe SF6 team is incapable of not cooking (even if this is the first time I'm doubting them).
Bison cant teleport anymore?
Hyped for Dictator! The realisation of the character is insaaaane.
capcpm made so bad costume designs so they force you to buy classic or alternates. SF6's costumes are terrible only but Zangief
11/10 visuals.
I dispise the camera angles for the super combos.
He died so he could run. Is it weird to be bummed out that knee press is a qcf move than instead of charge even if it's obviously a giant buff ?
I loooooooooooove that his classic outfit is basically a callback to the best version of Bison, CVS2. Now if only we could get Norio Wakamoto to do his voice again. 😂
Why does he have a horse ?
Roof feeding the streets again 👀
His ca is sick as fuck. Glad its not another one thats the same except for a flashier end
Yo roofle da god do you have a dojo in SF6? I want to join you should make one 💪🐵
I'm disappointed that M. Bison does not ride on a bison instead of a horse lol.
I only miss Bison teleports.  But really excited to try the big boss Bipson
Cute that Bison takes the time to braid his horse's hair.
I'm extremely disappointed that he is a fake charge
Was worried that I wouldn’t like playing bison since he’s a charge character but now that he’s a hybrid I think I’ll be able to play him
It amazes me how Capcom make homeless outfits look cool.
I'm definitely gonna have fun with this version of Bison
Why are they not filling up the space next to Luke and Jamie on the character select screen? It's driving me crazy!
I hate playing as charge characters. I never could figure out how to make it work. That makes me excited to try out the new Bison! He looks so cool in this game.
Bison looks better then ever WOW! Im so excited to Play my SFV Main! 5:04 🤣
wrong. charge is a relic of old game design and should be done away with permanently. i like my m. bison and praise god with every single charge input he loses.
Clearly he's going to be top 3 in the game 😮
CVS2 + SF4 vibes with SF6 normals. huhehehahahahahaha Psycho Crusha!
Uh sir, I was going to smash the like button regardless, but since you asked, I'll do it two more times!
That part at 5:05 LOL
I really liked SFV Bison. Fuck me I guess. 😂 But probably makes sense, since he has been "reborn".  I like they took the bomb concept and made it into something interesting. Psycho Crushers utility against projectiles welcome change.
The jp killer
No idea how happy I am that he's back in the game and he's not like his 5 version at all. That version made me stop playing and I finally feel like I can start playing sf6 seriously now.
Does he have any weaknesses?
ughhh why couldn't they make the kick charge as well???
Hey Roofle. Will you make a video about the new tekken 8 balance patch?
He feels like an evolution of CvS2 Bison, which is all I could ever ask for
Bison is really trying to be Raoh
Thats gotta be one of the best CA's ive seen
Damn he looks cool. Does he have an invincible wakeup?
I find the charge mechanic lame but I'm also new to street fighter and have only played Tekken and mk. so maybe I'm a lil biased
Its funny how Guile is just sitting in the background nonchalantly while his greatest enemy, who he thought was dead, is just there presumably fighting a clone of himself.
Bison's bomb reminds me of Testament's Stain state in Strive
I miss his SFV walk animation.
Capcom finally, FINALLY gave our boi and overhead!!!!! Hallelujah!
2:57 maybe blanka’s normal 2?
Need Bison to do a spiral arrow with the horse
5:05 lmao was that Richard Nixon
Pretty sure chun st.hp goes farther than bison’s but his is definitely looking clean
its a nod to the original street fighter movie with raul julia, theres a painting of him riding a horse
Knee press being motion input kind of annoys me. Was looking forward to another nearly full charge character. Guess I still have guile lol
M bison looks homeless now
Smashing like for them colors
Isn’t that standing on the hand thing another reference to the animated movie? Maybe I’m misremembering.
His horse’s name is Charlie.
M. Bison aint here to horse around
M&M Bison, because he comes in as many colors as M&Ms.  "My choco power is unlimited!"
Greetings
Always love the channel greeting
Ain’t no way that boy BIG ROOF got us covered with the Bison showcase! Thanks as always for these very special uploads🦧
I thought the slide would be cr. HK and the sweep would be D+F HK. The only reason I thought this would be the case is because in modern controls D+F HK is your sweep and Bison's classic slide was cr. HK.
Oh, scissor kicks isn’t a charge motion. I officially am no longer ambivalent to charge haters, yall ruined my guy
The horse is in the character select screen!  I’m starting the campaign now to get Bison’s horse as a playable character on the roster. It needs to be in the character pass next year and a day 1 character for SF7!
I choose to believe that the horse is M Bison and he's controlling the human body through telepathy
YOOOOOOO
Where is fei long???
So Basically to recap: This version of Bison is very fast, has great pressure(well, seemingly anyways, more time needed lol), big buttons, easy combos. However his anti-air game is... sufficient at best, no easy dragon punches here, and he basically has no defense other than the universal mechanics. While I am personally a fan I don't necessarily see him being a universal hit like Akuma because he simply just doesn't have every single tool in the game like he does lol. That said though I can absolutely see him finding his audience and I personally am very interested as he's like the more classic bison ive invested thousands? of hours of my life on in various games over the years.
MY KINGDOM FOR A HORSE!
You're the man rooflemonger!!! i cant wait to gett my hands on bison hes been my main since sf2 so excited 😢🎉🎉🎉
So I was lucky enough to be at the Summer Game Fest to try out M. Bison ahead of his launch of June the 26th! As you would expect when I get my hands on a fighting game, I had to really learn all the details and particulars and now I pass that info on to you! I am a huge fan of Bison but... not the SFV Version. That said this Bison is very much like the classic bison of the old days, very fast walkspeed, big buttons and all that! Classic Bison with some new things from SFV like the time bomb mechanic = a very fun version of the character. So give watch, leave a like if ya liked it and let me know what you think!
My second favourite charge character of all times. First one is our big boy Honda. I am delighted to see they gave him a proper Psycho Crusher, not the useless energy bubbles.
2nd lol I clicked so fast
I love you lord Roofle!! Gods work as always
Say it ain't sooooooo
