Lol literally everything in this video is false. This is not why the rainbow is shaped that way. Disinformation!
THANK YOU! When I was a kid, I noticed on a flight that there was always a bright spot 180° from a light source. I started to see this effect everywhere. It could be at a large scale like from a plane or a small scale like looking into freshly cut grass. I figured there had to be a name for it, but I never found someone who knew.
I’m surprised it’s considered an optical allusion when it’s still there in a picture which is different than an eye.
I Knew This Was a Toy. Too Pervee!!!
I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. (Gen 9:13-16)
ROY G BIV
It starts looking like a triple rainbow
NIce this dope bro ... great job🔥🔥🔥🔥😎😎💯💯💯💯💯💯
Flerf fainted after watching this
It is all just very explainable, if you conveniently ignore that the light reflected from each raindrop will be scattered from all rain droplets between the first reflection and the observer.
So that’s why 42 is the answer. Mind blown. 🤯
Science is cool! I understand rainbows a lot better now. Thank you!
Taught this in High School Science Classes Our Female Teacher she was knowledgeable Practical Doing made Theory Totally UNDERSTANDABLE
Love rainbows, so beautiful. Once saw a white rainbow. Beautiful!
Great work! I really enjoyed this. Also nice quote: “Learning should be about understanding, not about memorizing a list of facts” 👏
for some reason i feel likr this proves the firmament even more. just one dull pencils thought so geeks dont come for me plz
That blue laser’s origin isn’t in the same place as the smaller ones. I think that’s why the result was different than what you expected.
3 things= water, light and an Arch shaped firm-a-ment mirror! I know when I saw the production value huge lies/propaganda were coming! Furthermore, any solid working flat earth model allows for "insets" in the dome/firmament that direct light similar to how a flashlight lights a specific area and the other areas though relatively choose can remain dark.   But really, let's stop with the is it flat nonsense. Come on, here's the proof, Bible says The Father's throne is above highest North, Polaris, only star that doesn't move, Aurora borealis is the green, color of love, energy of The Father coming into the electrically charged firm-a-ment that sits on Antarctica, the oceans are a huge salt water battery, we are wireless bioelectric beings powered by the Aether, element removed from periodic table that Teslas work based in, wireless electrical type power, where does your pulse come from, radio signal that comes from OUTSIDE your body, back to the firm-a-ment! So you can believe in your globe nonsense but every half second Yahuwah, the Most High Living El, sends a signal to tell your heart to beat every half second via the firmament dome that is His Footstool above your head right now!! Amen
Amazing
I have such a weird question...  If our eyeballs are like the glass ball, when light enters it... How come there aren't burning spots in the back of our heads or behind our eyes?   Totally weird question, I know.  But honestly I'm just curious
It is those straight rainbows that are really cool.
Rainbow is spherical.
I'm obsessed with this video and its explanation
when I was a kid my mom just said "god put it there as a promise to never try to kill everyone on earth again" — I like your explanation better 😂
amazing!!!  i acually knew a great deal of that !  vary well don love the vids !
The algorithm continues to creep me out, but Im beyond stoked that it worked out this time. Literally days ago my wife and I were driving down the highway during heavy rain and there was a big rainbow ahead of us, and I got to asking all the questions you pose in thia video: why are we seeing a big arch? Are we seeing the same thing? Why isn't every drop just casting its own rainbow and filling the sky with them? Your demonstrations and explications absolutely hit and this answered literally all my questions. Thanks so much for making this, Bill Nye would be proud
Im sure your son understands all of this.
When I was a kid, I was told rainbow doesn't really exists, it is a result of the scattering of light by water droplets.  As a result everyone see a different rainbow since it is all in our brain.  But some curious kid asked why does it arch?  The teacher has no answer other than say that each of our cornea is bent slightly so when that scattered light goes into your lense, it gets bent again through refraction and so you see the arch.    The teacher than proceeded to show us how to see rainbow by looking a fringes of soap films.  I am sure many of you old enough probably still remember.  And you probably also remember seeing rainbow after a rain.   Well, I am sorry to report to you that I can no longer see the rainbow.  I am not sure if this applies to you.  About 20 years ago, I was in the hospital for a life threatening emergency.  It didn't hit me at the time but something changed in me.  I started hearing a constant ringing in my right ears, eventually it settled to just blowing air in and out.  It eventually went away after my child was born, but it came back after a few years and it's been a constant static background even as I am typing this.    A few years back when I ended up in a psyche ward, the people in there told me about hearing voices, eventually for a brief moment I herd voices too and then I heard some chiming as if I was picking up some TV signal of a game show.   Before all this I also experienced a brief moments of complete blindness which wrecked my vision for a while but when I got it back, I feel like I got a different set of eyes.  You see my eyes has these horizontal lines across one of them and the other is burst with small lines cracks.  This is because I had really high blood pressure in the past that caused the veins in my eyes to burst.  The one withe cat eye was the functioning one, the crack one is quite weak, this is why I needed prescription glasses to compensate for the difference.  But now both of my eyes are of equal strength but weaker than before but few damages from my days of high blood pressure.    I suspect I lost the ability to see rainbows originally because I really did damaged my cornea.  But I don't think my current cornea were mine, someone may have replaced them without my consent.  As for that ringing in the ear, I don't know.  All I know is I don't think the people I met in the psyche ward were all crazy.   I know at least my roommate was pretending because he said he doesn't want to be homeless on the street.
I'll never forget the day I was driving home from the store one day after a short rainstorm with my daughter who was maybe 6 at the time and we drove through a rainbow. I stopped and looked around and she asked me what I was doing. I told her we just drove throught the end of the rainbow and I was looking for the pot of gold. She laughed and said, "Silly, Mama. That wasn't the end of the rainbow it was the beginning of the rainbow. It ends way over there." And she pointed to the west of where we were at. Smart kiddo!
I just turned my idea into a theorem out of this. One day, I’ll get your autograph.
Wow, thank you for this!! Can you explain why the rainbow curve is so much shallower in New Zealand?
*The red and yellow mix to produce the orange in the middle of these two. Then the yellow and blue mix or overlap to produce the green and last the red and blue overlap to produce the violet. There is also a green blue but that's not seen here.*    God is pretty amazing!!!
I think I just watched an extremely compelling ad for the sale of glass spheres.
Rainbows are created from all the different 3d overlays over the dome. Don't forget we've been lied to about EVERYTHING 💥
Back at school in 7th grade I asked my teacher the same question. She said "because the Earth is round" 😂😂😂 well I wasn't convinced of course but I haven't looked it up until now I'm 24
Very impressed. Dived a year into optics, but this is still all novel to me in this combination! Brilliant!
IT'S FLAT!
Actually, you need four things: Rain, sun, light, and the firmament.
This is what Freemasonic symbolism encodes btw 😂
Yeah but "Where's the gold?"  lol 🍀
17:04 from a biblical perspective, knowing that the rainbow was created by God as a sign of his promise, a specific promise of course, but it reminds me of all God's promises to His children, this fact is so sweet! We have such a sweet Creator God. His promises are for everyone but specific per person as He is sovereign over everything and every small detail (rain drop) He will line up for the good of those who love Him and are called according to His purpose. (Romans 8:28)
14:18 God, the Creator, is so good! Genuinely, how can people studying the Earth and all its intricacies, not come to the conclusion that there is a Creator behind it all. It didn't all happen by chance.
Without rainbows, rain blows.
This is really cool 🤯🤯🤯
This was such a good way to start my Sunday! God is so amazing. That rainbow 🌈 is God's promise to never flood the earth again. What a beautiful reminder of our Savior's love. And the lengths He will go to to save us from ourselves and to show His promises are always kept. The prophecies that have been fulfilled show His attention to detail and how the new and old testament is like a mirror of each other along with so much more magnificent amazing things The Great I AM has done to show how powerful and wonderful He is, the peace that comes only from Him, is something to be shouting about on the mountain tops! Every time we see a rainbow a flower a smile try to focus on how beautiful things really are and that helps with anxiety and low energy. Thinking about and being thankful for God's love and grace is the best mind set so I hope I've steered your thought process into a positive one! God bless everyone in Jesus' name AMEN ❤
YES
I love rainbows. 🌈
Man, you unlocked some daddy issues with this one.
I was looking up through the sunroof of the car during a road trip at noon when the sun was at its highest point. And I was amazing to see a perfect quadruple rainbow that COMPLETELY encircled the sun. As I continued to stare at it in amazement I discovered it also had INVERTED rainbows like curving the opposite direction of the circle at 4 points of the circle that met up at the ends. It was the most amazing and perplexing rainbow I have ever seen with the sun in the center. I was hoping this video would explain it, and I guess in a way it did, but in other ways it did not! Thank you for the video! I hope someone reads this and can give me their feedback on why I saw such a rainbow!❤
I really like how you drew the line of light with the wavelength of the light represented by a separate sine wave. A lot of people don't realize that the wave is actually the energy of the light, but the photons themselves travel in a straight line.
24:47 thanks dad
so iz da earf flat or roundy ?
so if he sets up hundreds of scpheres  will it make one giant one?  is the cone  of light  viewable  in the atmosphere as well?  Maybe there could be a part too this rainbow  one is neat!  I think  using a light pipe  from edmund optics  does similar as well.
🌈 Rainbows are my favorite thank you for teaching me new things about them
Thank you for treating your audience as intelligent humans which some of us actually are.  I absolutely appreciated this sensible explanation of why a rainbow always lines up its colors the same way every time. I will forever look at them with so much more reverence.
What about the set of genes massively deciding not to replicate (birth rate crisis in developed countries)? How can the theory at least partially explain this?
Energy intensity.  Earth-sun-galaxies double torus-Oort cloud-fermie cells magnetosphere shapes are columnar basalts, snow flakes, honeycomb, Star of David.  You and co2 are not the cause of earth’s global warming climate change, increasing axial tilt, rotation and magnetosphere. You are not gods. The mystery of the 7 crossings of the galaxies ecliptic in one rotation of the galactic bulge Jesus holds the n his hand is. 5 loaves crossings in with 2 apocalyptic 1,000 year end of the era fish crossings to go until the end of the geological epoch.  Jesus is the Way, the Truth and life eternal.
Didn't U just prove, that we are living inside a ball? ;)
what a colourful explanation; thank you 🤩
This video is a masterpiece! So many hidden facets to such a simple pleasure. Much thanks for elucidating them.
Waves and atoms don't hate one another they just Merge..atoms move to merg. Human minds get to choose...atoms just merge..its called creation...we humans don't understand that science yet...the average human only sees life and what's around their own eyes...the average human is completely ignorant of real world facts..
It is because of the sun reflecting the earth's and the moons reflection.
Over the summer a late afternoon shower had passed and left an amazing rainbow we were admiring. I mentioned there was only about 45 more minutes to view the rainbow. I knew this because as a youngster playing with the garden hose, the sun has to be behind the viewer, and in 50ish minutes the sun would be setting.
firmament
FINALLY! The VERY BEST 🌈rainbow🌈  explanation video, EVER!
I told my daughter - oh… literally everything you teased in intro. ❤ thanks but this nerd was already marveled by them before this video
The fact that we can make our rainbow at home with just a cut out of fabric and glass sphere and of course sunlight is super cool. Nice video.
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
🌈 in the sky: beautiful  🌈 On a flag : NO
I feel like I have a surveillance camera straight into Isaac Newton 3.0's lab. I slapped my forehead so many times while watching this video,  I think I will need to apply a balm to my skin.
I've always wondered what our ancient ancestors thought rainbows were.
HEEELLLLL YEAH!!! I've been trying to figure this out myself....it's taking too long...😂😂😂
16:50 "Your Shadow is the Center of Your Rainbow" sounds like the next hit song from @BillyEilish
Probably the best video about Rainbows EVER!!!! Thanks so much for making 🙏🌈
Why are rainbows curved? His son asked...  I would have told him a corny gay joke and said, "Bcuz they're not STRAIGHT ! (🥁 BA-DA-TSS) LOL🤪 But me as a straight man I'm here to tell everyone here that is gay that rainbows should not represent homosexuality. Rainbows are from the Bible that came from God and God put a rainbow to promise to never flood the world again.
I often see a rainbow around the sun
You still not answering the real question; where is the gold?, and what happened to the leprechaun?
God created the rainbow to remind us of his covenent with mankind!
14:54 Everyone knows that burns but still everyone will try sticking finger there and be amazed saying"fffocal"
You answered the question I had since I was in high school! Thank you very much! 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
Did not get the sunglasses part. The one till just before the glasses was just brill! This was so well explained.
Me, a homeschooler: I didn't learn anything about rainbows at school! 😜
Outstanding! Very cool.
17:05 No, a rainbow is nót an illusion. It is an MLA: a Miraculous Logical Apparition.   ...OK, I made this up. MLA feels more fitting to me than illusion :)
I loved it❤❤❤❤
Beautiful, thank you champ❤❤❤❤
my only question is that magenta is not a mix of blue and red because magenta is a pure red, whereas a “rose-red” is technically a weak orange hue
I think I followed the explanations fairly well but I don't think I understood the whole thing well enough to answer a question I had when I started watching this. The question is, is there anything about this explanation that works for or against the flat Earth theory. I work with a guy that seems pretty sure the flat Earth theory has merit and I argue with him on numerous occasions with different arguments that I thought of but he usually seems to have some kind of speculative or half-way answer for them that he thinks are plausible enough to let him stay convinced of his position.  I would love to find something that really proved it false in a way that he has no answer for.
Great video! Can you simplify it for me?
42....
me and my friend were watching a rainbow like a month ago and trying to really really understand why rainbows work, amazing this video is out.
Interesting!  I learned something. 👍 Genisis 9:7-17
5:56 Can someone explain why it changed direction down and not up in the diagram?
Reflecting off the dome. ❤
If they called them rainbow someone probably already knew. You don't just see them when it rains.
Caralho, o cara faz um experimento e diz que é ilusão?
Not one mention of God & that the rainbow is a symbol of His everlasting promise to us. 😢
thats rainbow are actually not about being gay
Gods promise there will never be another flood.
I think it’s safe to say that you found the end of the rainbow. Thank you for sharing the pot of gold with us!
so why do you only see rainbows outside? you dont see rainbows inside.
What if we could put a dome of water into low earth orbit.
God's design is truly magnificent.
Excellent! Thank you!
Now I'm wondering what the limit is in terms of atmospheric mediums for rainbow creation (e.g. Would sulfuric acid particles in Venus' atmosphere be capable of creating this illusion as well?)
I saw a rainbow this summer that can only be described as a rainsphere.  The entire middle of it was bright pink and bright right at sunset
So... After watching this I'm like.... Can you tell me the simple explanation now, you know, the one you spared us of at the beginning?
Wrong
"But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father."
And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose. Romans 8:28
But there’s DEFINITELY not a dome of anything above us.  Definitely not.
We aren’t on a spinning ball. That’s a Luciferian deception that opens us up to all the other lies.  Water disproves the globe. And I suppose rainbows do, too.  And pressure vs vacuum needs a barrier.   TRUTH: nit a spinning ball.
It’s the dome.
It is incredible that Bird feathers aren’t pigmented…the colour is produced by refraction of light. Structural colouration.
I saw a white rainbow…true….but smaller than the coloured type.  It was a misty morning, near Toowoomba Qld…the sun was rising on my right and the white rainbow was on my left.  Gee I wish I’d stopped and taken a photo.
This is, without a doubt, the best YouTube channel.
One time, a drop of water on the back of my hand, sunlight hits it & reflects my shadow, the sky, I see through it deeply, and it becomes the whole universe, and else disappears
Don't show those weirdo flat earthers. They'll tear you apart.
Replace that glass sphere with the firmament. Nice try though. To your son, rainbow is curved bc we live in a firmament.
Awesome
Thank you I am a little wiser 😀
Now, let's cut out the BS about a raindrop.. And admit there can ONLY be curved rainbow and sundogs BECAUSE the light shining through the FIRMAMENT.
wow this is nicee
👽👀☃️
Magnetics Question:  We observe that when 2 magnets come close enough to each other whereby their magnetic fields effect each other either by repelling or attracting. And if the magnets are facing each other at alike poles, and that each magnet is not anchored but are free to move; the polar shift to opposite is swift & the attraction often violent enough to break the magnets. Now when I hold a magnet in my hand that has a magnetic field of it's own; Why does it not swiftly go to the North Pole since the Globe Model of Earth tells us that the Earth has a magnetic field? Why is it that my magnet with it's magnetic field does not interact with Earth's magnetic field as it does with all other magnetic fields. I say North Pole and not South Pole because my compass clearly displays a magnetic location to the North. I have witnessed no evidence thus far of a Southern magnetism. Have you? The North Pole region could very well have a South Pole as well (positive/negative) if this is the only region with measurable magnetic fields. A "U" shape magnet if you will. Could you demonstrate on a table top model 2 magnets within each others magnetic fields that are not effected as my magnet is not effected by Earth's magnetic field???
Could you boil water at focal?
Angles in the out & in Fields
One time my husband and I saw a fourple rainbow (two doubles together). It was amazing!!
Thanks Dad. Nice graphics btw. Do those replace cartoons in your household?
Wow!
double rainbows suck
It sounds so interesting and it still is but it’s so complicated to understand that it makes me feel as smart as a rock… 😂
17:28 oh my god so this is why I always see rainbows at approximately the same time of day in the evening
Great video. One remark: should better have given the line in the graph of alpha vs d another colour, than the red of the beams, for clarity.
When I get late afternoon rain, the sun will make a triple rainbow in my valley.
More gay propaganda
Oh I understand now why the rainbow is curved because I am gay 💅🏽.
Currently watching this video, and I have questions, if you’d be so kind to answer. Last week I documented a double rainbow, where the upper rainbow was almost not visible, outside our home, in an area that they repeatedly occur, and I’ve taken pictures of previously, yet that isn’t supposed to happen. Also it was dark above, in the bow band area, and below it. There was light outside it to the left / north side. Here is the biggest thing: this rainbow was spotted in a different area miles away several hours earlier, the same day and then it appears it moved with the clouds across the sky. How are any of those situations possible? Thank you. God’s Blessings 🙏🏼
figure this out-------------how GOD has made humans the focal point of HIS light.
GOD is wonderful with science explaining man's minimal understanding
In India its expermentally shown with clearing all basics .
Now if you apply this towards the flat earth model is why we get a Rainbow. In a globe Spherical Earth model you would never see the colors from earth bcuz the rainbow would be perimeter of the atmospheric boundry of Earth...I like how they tried to confuse everyone with the Scientific word salad bcuz most dont know how to think & observe with an empirical premise. Why does the Rainbow have a begining & an End...bcuz we have a flat earth with a dome(not quite a dome shape tho).  Ask for Emperical research & Data vs. Mainstream Academic Consentual Theoretical Rhetoric with great TV magic used to show fictitious evidence.  Yall have to think: Most of the World is Ignorant with inadequate education, this is done intentionally bcuz a world full of genius would destroy classism & poverty & greed. Those who know with malic in there hearts prey on the weakminded & the ignorant. Are we really being feed the truth or a lie which is to hide the Big Man in the sky. 🤔🫨🫡
This is the dumbest explanation I've heard of how rainbows form It doesn't even make any sense light goes through a raindrop bounces off the other side that's just retarded! How can you say light goes through 1 side of a raindrop but bounces off the other side? Make that make sense! You should be ashamed of yourself but I know you're not for misleading people Lying to peopleVff!
Moon halos next please 😎
Watch later I got a headache from the phone
Why are they flatter the more go to the south pole and more arch the more you go to the north pole?
Probably because some states made it illegal to have or talk about rainbows in school.
I took a picture of a whole rainbow from the plane I was on last week.  It was cool
24:15 Nice that tiny rainbow around the circular depiction of Wilsons picture! 😅
They say when you observe Quantum it act weird could observing a Rainbow the same
They say you can't find the end of a rainbow,  but we once drove through the end of a rainbow,  it went right over the hood of the truck. we passed through the rainbow, the colors went right over us. Three of us saw it.  We stopped  thinking we should look for a pot of gold just in case. We didn't find it tho 😂.  I've heard there is a scientific explanation for the phenomenon, we aren't the only ones who've  experienced the end of the rainbow
👏 Okay sir now please do an explanation diagram video of a circumzenithal arc (upside down rainbow). I only saw one once and it was maybe 1 in the afternoon but it had not rained. It was up very high in the sky, almost straight above my head. It was fascinating to see. Your video was wonderfully put together and would be so cool to see an example of this upside down rainbow formation
Yum
I was thinking ab you when they anouced it, thank you for steping away from them and honestly good for you i am one of the people who have "sims phazes" and only come watch your videos when im in one, so now ill have more phazes that i can come to you for, thats a yay for me
Scientist refuse to research about dreaming. They know about this just what pupils know about rainbows. I tried to teach them about the process of dreaming, but nobody listens. Nice to see that you find listeners who share your knowledge.
Дякуємо!
TOO BAD BIGOTRY INFECTS 50% OF "HUMANS"
I've thought about rainbows a lot as well. Seeing glories coming from the Moon was always fascinating.
A rainbow isnt an optical "illusion." Its an optical "phenomenon." An illusion is something that you arent actually seeing; you ARE actually seeing a rainbow. Its real. Its there. The light ACTUALLY splits apart and enters your eye as a band if different colors. It would an Illusion if the colors weren't real.
Beautiful! One question though: There are waterdrops between your eye and the waterdrop that refracts/reflects certain color (as seen in this wondeful model) - and since they are all randomly spread, how come they do not distort the picture (deflect the light ray randomly somewhere)?
Awesome video as always. But I think this is my favorite video out of all of your videos. Thanks again ❤
Glories 2 and 4. 24 number referanced in the book of revelation = 12 tribs and 12 churches. Reputre. Complete church. Jesus will come on the clouds in Glory.
Blue = 40 = water flood. Red = 42 = fire blood moon. Between 40 and 42 is Gods grace until 42 divided by12 = 3.5 trib time. Gods grace until the trib. The Bible in the sky all eyes will see.
Very good you just proved Gods word with those numbers of 40 and 42.  The very reason he put the rainbow in the sky. The primary difference is that 40 represents a significant period of testing, trial, or a new beginning, while 42 (specifically the "42 months") symbolizes a limited period of tribulation.  Best video of the year.
Earth is flat with a dome.
That was so cool, my brain finally understood how trig/geometry fundamentally works once you showed those spheres w/laseres. I'm gifted in that aspect, but I didn't have a lot of math help, but trig I would ace, and every day I think about going into a math major to learn trig, but, I'm nervous b/c I legit was not good w/geometry at all, but trig? This was an amazing video, and also, the best reason ever to have to make a video. Thanks for sharing.
Alexander's dark band sounds like it should've made a guest appearance on Metelocolyps.
We saw a beautiful rainbow today during arrivals at school. It was so bright. I’ve never seen it so bright before.
so im thinking rainbows are basically just really massive lense flares
Turkish plase 😢
nice presentation. Kind of glossed over why the >>greater amplitude of charge oscillation due to blue light creates a greater phase kick>> AM to PM conveersion in glass? I wouldn't expect that.  wouldn't it be better to say a delay creates a greater phase kick because the cycle time is shorter?
Is the wiggling blue light fog and haze?
understanding nature’s game is truly mind-blowing.
Excellent video
Seek out waterfalls to experience precious rainbows 🌈
8:40 they know how to manipulate energy to affect behavior and ultimately write their narrative of how people are seen. It’s like living in a world where you are attacking yourself for them. They start at an early age, when we are still in God source, and continue. The ones that fight back become the targets of their spells. The ones that surrender become the pawns for their evil.
Why aren't rainbows straight?   Self explanatory
You, sir, have brought me to tears. Your children are blessed to have you. 52 and learning still. I think my dad would be proud of me for that…if he were still alive. Thank you.
Rainbows are actually made of lead
Rainbows are my favorite scientific discovery.
Great! A small correction. Nature couldn't have given us the rainbow. Nature is an impersonal contingent category. And our universe has an end, which means it had a beginning, which means it's not the first uncaused, cause. You got to go back farther than that my friend. One day your son, the one who you seeded, will watch this and say thank you for the gift you've given to him. Will you do the same for the one who seeded you and gave you the ability to seed?  Romans 1:20-21, 25 NASB1995 [20] For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse. [21] For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened.  [25] For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.
Thank you for this video! In a way it teaches us to fuse math and science with philosophy and art. I like the idea that it takes many raindrops working together to produce one beautiful rainbow. So how many raindrops does it take to make a rainbow? I would imagine the more the better but is there a raindrop threshold?
❌✅ Why Not tell them the Truth ____ It’s because of the “FIRMAMENT DOME” Far simpler to explain that ☝️🧐💯
0:40 Pink Floyd
A natural rainbow should be called a rainbow array
Alright.. 27 minutes  on rainbows.  Here... we... gooooo
orbitals be like
That is something I have wondered my entire life - if the light from a rainbow is coming from the rain droplets, why do we see one rainbow and not billions of tiny one? Thank you, Derrick!
I know, I was a Rainbow Girl in the Masons Organization as Yellow, Orange and Indigo 😍
So I stopped seeing as many rainbows as an adult compared to as a child because I wear sunglasses?!!!
Why is the blue light dangerous? 11:18  😮 Amazing Video 😍
How about a mention of The Creator who indeed made this and all other things. "For the fool says in his heart, there is no God, and is deceived". Self deceiver.  The miracle of Creation is just that.
I was disappointed my dad didn't explain rainbows and clouds this well as a kid. I started reading science books for adults at age 6. That lead me to becoming a scientist.

And here I should say Oxford is a Christian college thus my studies for public health and stopping human trafficking and serial killers who are all NEANDERTHALs/ baboons for real)
I saw a circular rainbow ( brocken bow) directly overhead two years ago, strangely whilst a friend was asking me spiritual questions about Sousse ( illegally called Egyptian ancient ) tribe beliefs.  I'm a scientist and I swear the creator smiles if i confirm the science laws of religion. Like ravenna in Hinduism and Babylon in Bible being baboon-hyena-weasel DINOPITHECUS.  Lol
Spectrum.
Whoever invented eargasms deserve a raise
meh, it was better next year... lol - wonderful video that is very satisfying to learn!! Nice BM pic! I, too, saw a double rainbow there. Very bright.
the Hebrew word from the Nóach story is Qéshet … could also mean bow in the sense as from an archer … as in the Torah
14:46 no words. Physics is awesome,,,
Thank you! This was great! Good job.
In houston I saw a triple rainbow once. It was increadibly faint but there was a group of 8-15 of us that all saw the double with many of us seeing a faint triple
Thanks, dad
These days the only thing they will not tell you about rainbows is anyone flying it is mentally ill.
Badhia banaye ho
Amazing educational information please continue to share more of not widely known acknowledge
Why are there so many songs about rainbows?  And what’s on the other side?
That first 1 minute introduction was pretty cool I’m interested with more delight
Should be more enquiring minds, thanks. I find most people like science but no real interest in why!
🙏🙏🙏🙏
I just dont think this is how rainbow work.
Schools teach about the rainbow. It just has to do with sexuality, not science
yeah we saw the rainbow in ur experiment.. impressive 🎉🎉🎉
Pink Floyds Dark Side of the Moon needs an album cover update.
This ... Was ... Awesome !!! ... 🌈
Did you explain to him that rainbows only exist in consciousness?
Having biology as major but the love for physics just never fades away
Sure stuck it to Snell...Snell more like smell....
Okay there is a medium that slows light down, would a True vacuum speed light up?
Brilliant!
The only reason sch don't teach this is because kids are hoping to find their pot of gold under the rainbow and science will kill that fantasy-
But they always come after a rain?
I have seen a rainbow on the ground
The whole sky is a rainbow when you really look during sunrise and sunset. You can also trace the whole circle of the rainbow using a garden hose on mist setting.
Please someone name their band Alexander's Dark Band
Is the radius of a rainbow dependent upon the angle of the sun over the horizon?
Wow I love your dedication to detail and thoroughly appreciate this video
ARCHANGEL >Arc Angle of Light  Bible is Quantum knowledge
God is not a Man.  God is Light/photon. Bible
16:58 i noticed this while watering my lawn. When the water mist is dense enough, i can see a circle rainbow fixed in one place. I can move my eyes around but the circle is like hanging from something fixed.
Ok maybe I missed it but why is the wave that the charges create off phase with the light wave?
I wanted to listen to your content, but you have this crappy music and behind. That’s really loud and distracting stop with the crappy music in behind. Thumbs down can’t watch it too bad.
I made I shot which normally just seen from plane
"The center of every rainbow is you!" is the new pick up line!
Thank you so much for this work! Wow!!!
Ok, daddy, but how does the refracted light know how to avoid all the other raindrops and get scattered into white light?
It is literally videos like this that make me continue to come back to this channel... Spectacular stay curious
It seems to me, you've scientifically described how God put rainbows in earth's clouds, but you've not dealt with the Belt of Venus, the rainbow that exists at the boundary line between light and darkness. This was the original bow that was created first before God put His bow in the clouds. I've seen it several times after a storm has washed the sky clear of dirt and dust. It is visible at about sunrise and sunset but only when observing the horizon from a great distance. Nearby mountains, trees, and hills can and do obscure this bow.  It is visible near where the sun is obscured by the horizon and around the entire 360 degree horizon of the earth. It is literally a rainbow around the earth in the exact same way that there is a rainbow around the throne of God, Revelation 4:3.
Very cool.
Did you just answer the question I used to vanquish physics teachers? Why does light bend.. I got horseshit about cars on sand.. Never any explanation that was consistent... However.. You just stated it got a phase kick.. (because of the magnetic field by a moving charge.. ) Not why??? Why doesn't that happen in vacuum when it encounters a magnetic field then? Or does it?
That part where the angle of refractions stops then goes back the other way explains a winter sun 1200 miles away reaching it's peak of refraction in December 23-25 and not 93 million miles as we are lead to believe. 😮 Same with the moon. 😮
I've got a picture of a really cool rainbow. Looking at a low sun through misty clouds I can see another sun off of both sides of the "center" sun with a partial rainbow giving the appearance of an eye. Weird. I wish I knew how to upload it in this comment.
Whilst travelling in Mexico some years ago, I visited Misol Ha waterfall. The sun produced a rainbow in the spray and as I swam closer, the rainbow got longer and longer, until it formed a full circle. I never knew this was possible - and now I know how it works!
I was taught all of this in elementary school.
This video explained to me a phenomena I saw in my boyhood.   There was deep fog over ice-frozen snow, deep fog.   I could see a darker outline of myself - sunlight being behind me - reflected back in the fog with a kind of semi colored nimbus around me -- an optical phenomena I have never seen again.
It’s interesting that I came across this video now. About 2 weeks ago around 5:30pm it was raining. To the west, the clouds had cleared and the sun was out. Looking to the East out the window of our second story bathroom, I saw a rainbow hovering over our pool, with each end of the rainbow dropping just outside of the pool fence. I was looking at a slight downward angle as the top of the rainbow appeared to be slightly below my horizontal line of sight. I didn’t think much about it other than it being neat to see a rainbow right in my back yard. However, after watching the video, I was confounded as to how I saw the rainbow at all. After thinking about it, I can only conclude that the sun had to be high enough in the sky to allow for the 40-42 degree angle required to see the rainbow.
Solar panels work best at a 42* angle as well.
School teaches us ALOT of nonsense….such as “outer-space” actually being a thing, and the lie that we all live on a spinning ball that water magically sticks to
In the appreciation of the images of humanity, may we use these wonderful creations as instruments of worship for the Divine. 🙏🏻 😇 😇 😇 ❤️‍🔥 🙈 🙉 🙊 🤲🏻 💕
I really do feel bad for you guys!! It's really not your fault that you've been lied to your ENTIRE LIFE!!
WAKE UP!! It's because of the Firmament!! The further north you see a rainbow, the steeper the arch...Betcha your rainbows in Australia have a much shallower arch...But I understand that you work for the adversary, so...
God gave us the rainbow as a promise to not flood the earth again.
really well put together. kids would be pumped to have this class with you. engaging, understandable and with physical examples!
They said; Rainbow is LGBT Bla bla blah….!
Oh, this is so great. I'm getting it! I'm getting it!
May I just say that the very best part of the video is the excitement you prove during the experiments? Do it more, show it more… I think everyone will love it!
Could we say that rainbows prove that the earth is round?
You lost me at potato… 🤔😅🤦‍♀️
Please thank your son for asking this incredible question! Without it, we likely would never have seen this spectacular video.😊
Now we just need some good videos on how to get to the pot of gold, and where exactly is somewhere over the rainbow 😅
Yeah isn't that cool? Rainbows don't exist without an observer.
It feels like a research paper turns into a movie
shoutout to all the vfx artists that temporarily lose their minds while simulating caustics within layers of layers of layers of refractive objects.
VERY great channel, and its easy to see why you have such a large # of subs!   :)
As you raise the laser you are no longer hitting the glass head on. You are hitting a curved part of the surface!
I have tinted glass ball, I will try it with a laser beem?
kinda feel bad about the ray simply ignored for the rest of the video
Got one thing wrong here Derek..  you said at 17:00 no two people will ever see the same rainbow. Well at 19:18 not only does lots of people see the same rainbow they also see two of them over and over if they wish 😂😂😂
Daddy, now explain women😂
Did your son follow this, or stop asking you questions ?
16:09 is a great explanation for how rainbows actually work. Definitely watch that part.    Also the video probably has some similarly good points about polarization related to the reflection angle? I assume it's a very similar issue
"Your shadow is the center of a rainbow". It's like lyrics of a Led Zeppelin song!
How did you even think about how to begin this explanation? Mind boggling!!!
Thank you for this deep dive into rainbows...🙏🏾💖 I never knew...😊👍
So, I was explaining some of this to my science minded daughter and accidentally ran across what I think is a missing component of this video as it did not seem to address, directly anyway, the rainbow visible around a lawn sprinkler or waterfall.  It addressed glories and 2 degree refractivity, but not the much wider rainbows visible in these scenarios.  So, now I am curious.
And learning and figuring out are not the same as creating only the omniscient all wise all knowing all loving God knew exactly all the factors needed to make a rainbow praise his name. His name is Jesus Christ our Lord
Natural?...or Intelligent design?...AND The BEST thing (or worst), IS WE GET TO CHOOSE...✌️🙏😵‍💫
This is wonderfully satisfying to watch.
all afx fans at 8:20 be like 😯🫵
You only see the arc because of the horizon if you were in a plane and you observe that same rainbow, you would see a perfect circle
13 I set My rainbow in the cloud, and it shall be for the sign of the covenant between Me and the earth. 14 It shall be, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow shall be seen in the cloud; 15 and I will remember My covenant which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh. 16 The rainbow shall be in the cloud, and I will look on it to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.” 17 And God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is on the earth.” Genesis 9:13-17
Brilliant and So satisfying!
Is that where we get Glory    -holes come from 😆
I heard all they talk about in schools these days are rainbows 🏳️‍🌈 😂😂😂
Wait till your son asks where babies come from.  Lol
Great day for fishing ain’t it?
His son is something else
This is FASCINATING! An exquisite job! Thank you!
You replied to the question I asked my physics teacher in high school when I first saw my 1st double rainbow while going to school 15 years ago.   He was unable to answer me why the 2nd rainbow was inverted when we had just finished the chapter on waves.  This was an unfinished thing looming in my mind which I accepted I will not have the answer to. Even online the explanations are either simplistic or confusing.  Thanks Derek! 🙏
"A rainbow is an optical illusion made unique for each perspective." This is the mind blowing science I've come to appreciate from Veritasium.
Caustics' seems analogous to inharmonicity in sound waves from imperfect overtone source interference.
So, somewhere in outer space, the sunlight hitting earth has made a massively huge laser beam 😂
Does that mean one day blueray can evolve into violetray?
Yay
16:37 typical inaccuracy.. "_indigo_" is NOT considered a colour. . . at least not in recent time.  They have even changed school curriculum to reflect the change, now teaching the spectrum as ROYGBV instead of roygbiv.  Do you _actually_ research or just get distracted by shiny things?.. (I think the finger burn illustrates the answer!). LMFAO 🤦
14:56 there's a great rule you should learn to follow.. don't stick your finger anywhere you wouldn't stick your-- well, you get the rest.. 🤣🤣🤣🤦
Why the hell must scientists _double up_ on word usage??.. you say "caustics", I think acids and corrosives.. lol
Absolutely fabulous. I learned so much. Thank you.
I've heard that troops will not march over a bridge in step because the kinetic force amplifies and can bring the bridge down with the resonance. I'm sure that wasn't described properly but I'm wondering if blue light or any kind begins to resonate in increasing amplitude in a similar way and that can be used for any functional purposes.
Why, thank you, Sir! Thee RainBow explanation I legit didn't even really realize I'd needed!
14:46 looks like a vortex
This is the most Thorough and Enjoyable explanation of rainbows 🌈 I’ve ever seen or heard! ❤
Genesis 9:16
Moonbows too
I saw a flat earth advocate explain that the reason why rainbows are curved is that the light is interacting with the curved dome they say is above the flat earth. The logic, such as it is, began with an observation of a separate of colors at the edge of a sliding glass door. So the shape of the colors must be the same as the shape of the object that causes it.
0:28 burning man!!
Your videos are always amazing! Constructive criticism, it's farther not further when talking about physical distance. Sorry to be so picky. Thanks for all you do.
Dont care what you say  We live in a enclosed space.. under the dome that is why the cure  Love yall
all cause a kid asked the right question. 🖖🫡
I have seen the most beautiful Rain bow 40 yeats ago , in kansas , no one but God can imagine 🙏🙌🙏  the Rainbow is a symbol & reference of The Covenant of God's Promises  🙌
So many beautiful metaphors in this video.  Thanks, Veritasium 🥹
What They (Probably) Don't Teach You About Rainbows At School  Well yes indeed
I get shivers when I think that my rainbow is not your rainbow. We are seeing different photons taking a different path. My reality is not your reality. Spooky distance at an action.
So basically rainbows are projected holograms
Son: "Why are rainbows curved?" Dad: *makes half hour YouTube video explaining scientific angles*
Un pippone fuori dal normale. Dovete dargli un premio per il video più pippone di sempre.
loving this knowledge. I have captured a supernumery rainbow with at least 6 bands of repeated rainbow colors. I have also observed red rainbows at sunrise and sunset, and have seen a "travelling" rainbow, observed while travelling in a car, parts of the rainbow only, starting at one end and ending at the other, marched across the sky, only a section visible at a time, til the final rainbow section reached the other end. Was this becuase the rain travelled with me? interesting to ponder. I also saw multiple rainbows, identical and repeated, in the surf spray of every wave. the angles had to be just right. I do want to add though, that there is not just science  involved iin the rainbow, but has been place their by our Creator. As a promise sign, to never again flood the earth as in Noahs' flood. It must have never rained before this event, (I have heard it said that the water might have been a mist, or low fog. ) ...and the rainbow is is a beautiful sign of God's promise and Creation. (science included!!)
Beautiful explanation. Thanks
The most clear, complete and thorough explanation video of a physical phenomenon ever!
The LGBTQ community has hijacked the rainbow. The only time it gets talked in school , is non science reasons
Understanding rainbows in such a scientific way is fascinating. And what is more fascinating is this is a NATURAL PHENOMENON. Nature is just showing us the beautiful things.😮
The wonder in your kid's voice convinced me: it's great to have nerdy parents. Your son is lucky
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING THIS VIDEO!! ❤
the music is too loud and repetitive and annoying and makes it difficult to concentrate  if this were a classroom setting you wouldn’t allow a student to blast their boombox and disturb other students, so why layer annoying music in your video?
If God is anywhere, God is in the electromagnetic spectrum, God is light
5:59 doesn't it mean that the light continues straight but only comes out of the material in scattered different phases and not changes direction altogether? If will take a small portion of the light and not the whole height of the screen it will look clearer ,according to your explanation, that the light will be slanted but still continue straight, and not change direction
when light photons hit eart and bounces back to the sun. What happens to that photons when they hit the sun? Do they continue living in the sun? Do they die? Do they bounce back and hit earth again?
16:42 yet another question answered by the number 42
Republicans: Dat rainbow must be gay! Git him! 🥴😅
12:00
I always said the answer to the ultimate question of "life the universe and everything" was a rainbow
"Um, ok nevermind dad!" :P
I am not your son, but you explained it better than I could to my son.   Well made video.
Why doesn't the planetary bodies slow down like even light does when they're doing orbits?💫
Why doesn't the planetary bodies slow down like even light does when they're doing orbits?💫
At 6:25, “well before Snell”, you use the designation CE for common era. I don’t appreciate that because it is an attempt by the globalist to hide Jesus from the history of the world. The correct designation is BC and AD.
I was going to ask about the rainbows that show up around porch lights on a dark night, but I think the video already explains the same process 😅 please correct me if I'm wrong
23:54 this is a message. Choose the right!
I think we are having an intellectual renaissance
The reason the rainbow looks like the girls are behind. The horizon is an optical illusion the part that was complete the circle beneath the horizon is actually in front of you and invisible.
Also rainbows don’t go behind horizons they’re in front of the horizon
Because rainbows are circles
I would have to say that everything moves in Waves. Crest and trough, and the line in the center between the two is the equator between polarities. In a way that proves duality is an instrumental part of reality.
8:35  42.. .. .. It's simply the answer to EVERYTHING.
25:44 Learning should be about mastering a subject  Not to memorizing a list of facts . Well said 🙏🏻
18:24 ..about Brewster’s angle I studied that transmitted light is partially polarised and the reflected light is fully polarised but in the video you mentioned that both are polarised.  Just wanted to clarify .. maybe I’m wrong.
Craziest thing I've ever seen is with polarized sunglasses on. And looking through 5% window tint.
Alexander's Dark Band sounds like a Pink Floyd hate group
This was so interesting !  Thank you !
I have spent many years worling on tall radio / TV masts and have on occasions seen and photographed glories. Thanks so much for this excellent video!
Cause God give us a sign thats all
More interesting than i thought
<3
One morning, I was walking into a fog bank, and before me was what I called a rainbow (I now know it is called a glory... in the morning). As I took a step forward, the glory receded only 1/2 a step, until it was only 1/2 a step in front of me. It disappeared as i took the last step. Another morning, another location, I saw the moon between the two arcs of a double rainbow. I did take a photo, but the resolution...
Better than any school class on refraction. Thanks!
interesting!🤔  very interesting...
25:57 how many channels have you seen sponsoring brilliant?  Me: *yes*
1:14 This reminds me of God's promise.
narrator here is fullofit
what is happening is that light gets absorbed and re emitted at a pace that would give you the effect of light going slower through the medium, but it is not.  The speed of causality or speed of light remains the same.   ---Francisco Ramirez  and me.
light does not slow down thru glass.
so I am pretty sure I have watched this more than once and it is one of the most beautiful representations of light and rainbows I have ever seen! I have a question though - where do you get your awesome diagrams to show the proof of the statements made? They are fantastic - do you do them yourself?
This really reminded me of the lectures from Walter Lewin. There were some great ones on light and rainbows.
Not the explanation of what light is. My mind went poof.
great video. but one more question: if i was able to perceive more wavelengths of light i would see all the „colors“ between two rainbows. is that right?
I've seen a triple rainbow several times, and one time a quad rainbow, and one thing I noticed, the more rainbows there are, the first one (closest) is always super vibrant, the second a little less vibrant and so on with the final one (3rd or 4th) is barely visible. I then started to notice that most rainbows are atleast double rainbows, it's just the second is barely visible
Best video on the whole of YouTube.
Dude the title is not true because I saw one end of a rainbow and my mom saw the other end of the SAME WINDOW in the parking lot
I'm in high school with a test on light tmrw and I'm gonna flex so much in it
EVERYONE AT HOME! DONT SET A TRANSPARENT SPHERE IN FRONT OF THE WINDOW LIKE THAT! I'd use something inflamable like kevlar, whool or porcelain to catch the light beam before it touches anything
He only asked about the shape😭😭😭
Reassuring to know such analyses have been made and such general concepts communicated, despite my not being able to grasp the details.
Parabola 🙏
Don't know how I missed this video earlier but coincidentally i was thinking explore more on rainbow formation. And got this... This is perhaps one of the best video I have seen on your channel and felt Voilà! This also breaks the myth or over simplification of science. I felt the joy you must have enjoyed while experimenting and discovering how rainbow actually forms.
What they dont teach is a certain group of brainless apes thinks thats a sign of god. Piety is the vessel of evil and they will rape your kids and steal your money.
why are rainbows curved?  well I guess rainbows aren't for straights...
14:29 spy tf2?
Thank God, not even did He give the rainbow as a symbol of peace, but he made it unique for every person viewing it!
5:22  I think you mean that the amplitude stays the same..since the wavelength decreases, so it means the frequency has to increase since wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional
We saw a circle rainbow over Wright Brothers Memorial...one of the coolest things I've ever seen
where did you get that shiny glass ball?
Beautifully explained. I too thought I knew how rainbows were created and definitely learned a lot in this video.   I now would love the watch a video that dives as deep into how halos are created. How does it work, with the ice crystals not being spherical and oriented in all random directions, that we can still see a ring (or rings) around the sun...?
Food can change your brain wave into visible rainbows
Changing intensity and frequency of rainbow we can create bigger naval artillery
24:45  Such a thorough explanation, but it doesn't answer why God made the droplets refractive so that they could operate as agents of his message? 😅
Stop changing thumbnails it's disgusting
Thanks for simplifying this.
I too, like rainbows
19:20 I'd say that's a double rainbow all the way across the sky
Derek, your dad of the year for this video! 🎉 beautifully done sir
...is that the rainbow does not belong to crazy people
13:39
Where you have curves, you know you're in for a good time!
So why do rainbows have so many different shapes, some are wide and some are tall?
Yeah  rainbows gay tho
I watched this video when it was new. And one practical piece of information i took away was that the rainbow will always be opposite the sun from the observer's perspective. And then yesterday i saw a rainbow near the sun. If the sun was at 12 o'clock the rainbow was at about 2 o'clock. I would LOVE to understand why.   More info: it was just a piece of rainbow that appeared to be on a cloud. So I'm assuming the conditions were just right to have the light bounce around and come my direction.   I was driving but got a couple pictures
i love your videos and i love colours and experiencing the wonders of the world so thank you so much for this video!
The only thing I think you missed is why the second rainbow is flipped.(I might have missed it if it was explained on some level)
Stars have caustics also that change in to the shape of dogs
The firmement is the third media its makes the curve simple
imagine being the teacher of vertiasum's kid
You should take what you can get
GREAT
1:13 only if i had myselft to observe
one* question interesting to me, now that its right droplets on right spots to be in the right angle. now why rainbow seems to always be so far away, there's also drops near that have the angle requirements.
and here the rainbow we see is physically the water droplet itself, and are millions of them there and them being in the right spots thats why you incomplete rainbows, because there is no water droplets on the missing areas.   and if there's burst kind of rain, one that rain only on one spot, then if you see rainbow there its only a peice of a slice of the rainbow.
Wait, wait...If the half of the Earth in front of you wasn't there, would a rainbow be a complete circle?
The answer is 42
You see a rainbow when looking at the sun. It's called a sun dog.
Thanks so much for your content I love the opportunity to learn these concepts and have access to equipment I'd never see on my own
the fact that i am jee aspirant and can understand all of this is crazy jee is really crazy
Except when someone takes a picture of it which is probably more common than seeing an actual rainbow because people love to take pictures of them
wow this 4k quality is great! 🤗🤗🤗
One minute into it I feel like crying 😂
You lost me at "this giant glass sphere represents a raindrop"
Wouldn't it have just been easier to say "I don't know."?
This leans into your video about light taking ALL possible paths at the same time.
Thank you for this excellent explanation. Great to know this after 75 years with just a vague idea.
The sun is a flat disk of half a degree diameter.  The raindrop is spherical, as you say we see through a sheet of raindrops.  The size of the droplets is irrelevant, only the angles matter, and they are intrinsic (the same for water drops of all size)  The rainbow is a full circle.  Is it an (albeit spectral) image of the sun?  I have observed a white bow in fog.  What if the sun were 1 degree?  Based on my observation that the rainbow is about half a degree wide, I suspect the rainbow would be twice as wide.
Pretty underhanded of you to put "smarter every day" in your video description..
25:16 this is a really cool video, but I do have to say I really dislike this way of looking at the conclusion.    We have most certainly not "figured it out."  We've discovered a lot of great information which is really cool, but to say we've "figured it out" implies that we understand it completely and, critically, that there's nothing more to be discovered.  That will never be the case, with anything really - in order to know, for a fact, that there is nothing more to discover about something, we'd have to know literally everything about every detail of the entire universe.  Otherwise, there's always a chance that something we don't know affects thus aspect in a way we don't see.  And that's not to be pessimistic about our understanding - exactly the opposite.  I think the wonder of science and this world we live in is that there is an infinite amount to discover.  Everything we learn begets new, more complicated questions, so no matter how long we're here, we will always have more science to do, and people will always get the satisfaction of uncovering how things work.  But it also means something very important: we need to avoid the trap of thinking that we know everything, or even a lot, about science.  We know very, very little - we don't even know how much we don't know.  And the things we do know could very well be wrong, or incomplete.  We need to be willing to question even the most "proven" laws, and never stop considering new possibilities.  And most of all we need to be humble in our research, and understand just how much we always don't know.  Otherwise, we start making assumptions, and then "proving" things based on those assumptions, and even making real-world decisions about technology, history, etc. based on unfounded knowledge.
Wow...🎉 You did an amazing job. Can't even imagine how much you have helped the curious minds who wanted to understand this so bad.. Thank you❤️ 🙏🏻
🌈 Crazy to think that no two people ever see the same rainbow… makes you wonder if reality itself is just perspective 👀
This is my second time watching this video; it might be my favorite Veritasium video!
You definitely can see a rainbow while looking into the sun. I remember at a school sports day the sun was directly above us in a perfect circle cut out in the clouds and just around the clouds was a perfect circle. Crazy thing to witness it looked like a godlike eyeball in the sky
I check the comment right away as soon as i notice the sound of rainbow in 1:29
Rainbows are a reminder to God of his covenant with man. He won't wash our world away with another flood
I see that someone went to BurningMan the year it rained lol
The video does a stellar job explaining why each person's rainbow experience is unique. You gain an appreciation for how perspective changes everything. It's fascinating to think how light, raindrops, and the observer's position weave such a personal spectacle. Definitely makes you look at rainbows with newfound curiosity!
14:30 😂😂😂 The sheer joy from success
42 degrees... interesting... I had always thought that the Answer was 42 because Elvis (who was a major supporting character in the HHGttG series) was 42 when he left us, but this is also compelling... but the Elvis hypothesis is far more likely, considering that I'm talking about the mind of Douglas Adams. But this is a brilliant explanation (pun fully intended), and many thanks to 3Blue1Brown (still my favourite pure mathematics channel despite recent departures from that discipline in the content) for the assistance provided to this video.  And the conclusion is exactly why science matters. Hopefully those who still don't understand this will see the light soon... but I won't hold my breath.
17:58 that Brewster's Angle is funky!
Genuinely eye opening content
Is this why shape of rainbow in Antarctica is different than in south Africa or Europe? That means there's a dome above us
Making a whole video because of your son is so sweet. He must be proud to have a dad like you
how long before your sun got up and walked away?
Imagine making a video because a 5 year ole asked why rainbows are curved
An amazing Video. Thanks for making we find more joy in rainbows and for helping me understand the science behind them
I hadn't been satisfied with your answer 😢
... or there's a firmament out there🤐
is that was what was mesnt with “ultimate answer to the ultimate question”?
My whole life is a lie 💔
I love rainbows so that's way I'm watching this lol
because everyones eyesights different
11:00 It's so cool how you can see the laser point follow the inside curve of the sphere in the laser light.
I wonder why the laser only reflects from the surfaces of the sphere. The medium changes, the light reflects, but why there?
0:07  Of curse you would 😂
Pretty sick to answer his question like this 😂🤘🏼😎

16:17 youtube compression must have loved this
Should wear laser specific safety Google's as and reflection of that laser will instantly destroy eye cells
Nice videoooo!!  Is it true that rainbows are not arcs but circles?
The entrance to this reminded me to take my mood stabilizers cause this video was about to be an emotional ride. 😅  Post video me: "but what about that boring angle?"
本当に内容が濃くて勉強になりました。！
Son:“Dad why are rainbows curved” Dad: walks away and spends a week making a video.
rainbowws are curved becuase they are gay
That doesn’t make sense. A 42d angle from my position to the raindrops along the arch doesn’t point back to a single light source. It would have to be a horizontal rainbow for that to be the case. The animation at the 15:37 min mark illustrates what I mean. The compass doesn't point back to the sun, it points back to another arch....
Why does the defraction of light cause it to bend if the light is movinv in a straight line.
This was just SO good!
so to summarize, if I got it right: A rainbow is the combined, warped reflections of the sun from within each raindrop, with each reflection warped/refracted into multiple colors by the spheroid shape and refractive index of each drop of water.
what does a rainbow look like in infrared and other wavelengths?
So it's not real it's fake
Wrong explanation seen every where !  we do not see rainbow  because of reflection of different colours in specific degree by rain drops.
Cheer~~~this is an arch of colors formed in the sky in certain circumstances, caused by the refraction and dispersion of the sun's light by rain or other water droplets in the atmosphere...(I just got quite an interesting channel I had today. still learning lyrics by heart)😊
thank you so much, huge fan from Kurdistan <3
As a college English professor (retired) I want to COMMEND YOU for giving full credit where credit is due— your sources— whenever possible.  It’s a beautiful thing 🤓📚
Forget about two people, even a single person sees 2 different rainbows with his two eyes.
The beauty of nature is magnificent.
So, its chromatic aberration 14:13
God made it. It's the work of the hands of the Lord.  Genesis 9:12-17 NKJV 12 And God said: “This is the sign of the covenant which I make between Me and you, and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: 13 I set My rainbow in the cloud, and it shall be for the sign of the covenant between Me and the earth. 14 It shall be, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow shall be seen in the cloud; 15 and I will remember My covenant which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh. 16 The rainbow shall be in the cloud, and I will look on it to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.” 17 And God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is on the earth.”
6:28 I appreciate you for that 🪐
I  see  you to were at raining man :)
Excelente. Brillante. Muy pedagógico. Enhorabuena y gracias
Thats a nice chapter name you got there, Veritasium.
the only way to see a rainbow inside your house is in a mirror. because of this it will be a flat rainbow. while outside the mirror is the sky and thus the rainbow is round. a rainbow will take the shape of its prism. truth is simple. so is proving what i just said. Like share subscribe later

Is the rainbow pattern produced by oil on the water surface caused by the same principle?
Please learn the following facts. Rainbows of the order 3, 4, 5, … and higher are all visible looking towards the sun. Brilliant ist telling rubbish. 👎👎👎
Zero setup questions—full version opened up right after install.
The frequency of light remains constant when it passes from one medium to another. This is because the frequency is determined by the source of the light, not the medium it is traveling through.
I just discovered how my glasses bend light redirect it to the right place. At 6:28 I knew that in high school but i didn't know the deeper reason why it does that
We don't always see rainbow at 40 degrees to the eye, its not true. We see rainbows at all different angles — even in the photos you could see that. Raindows are a projection, its not an illusion like he cliams here. Furthermore he doesnt explan how this works within the rules perspective.
If the wave length changes then why doesn’t it change colour?
No
You didn't explain why there is a pot of gold in the end.
Why silly background music?
Holy Ram!! This is a real mind bending video that makes you think about the magician up there. Because the odds of this art being created is probably less likely.
I imagine it is the same science for when you see a ring/halo around the sun or full moon when there is high humidity
In the wind car explanation, you were fantastic. But here we have some practical problems. Unlike you, you used a lot of theory and ignored real-world practice. The sphere is far from forming a rainbow, just like water on water droplets, as supposed (you completely ignored practice). The reflection isn't from the back of the sphere, but from the front. You can verify this with a metal sphere or even a metal cylinder. Well, the explanation was good, but it's theoretical and doesn't represent the formation of a rainbow, which is quite different in practice. Can we come up with a more realistic experiment, one that's similar to practice? I've tried doing the experiment with water, indoors and without sunlight, but it didn't work. The rainbow only appears outside and in the sun. It can be done by simply pouring water, but if it's inside a room, as I did, I couldn't do it. So I assume there's something round or cylindrical that reflects light in the atmosphere, and it's not the water droplets. I don't know...I haven't been able to do an experiment similar to the real one yet. Anyway, it's just my opinion, which may contain errors and alternative forms, but your work is very good. Congratulations on the channel.
Saw recently a post of a shadow of an airplane on clouds creating a "Glory" rainbow. Without looking up any references, I made my own theory how that was directly linked with wavelength interference, and I am happy to know It wasn't too far off.  There is so much natural wonders that are actually so simple, and  might inspire really incredible technology
42 degree... 42...
12:30
I swear he was gonna say action
This is true,, but its also a truth that doesn't amount to anything, we use majority consensus to come to an agreement about what we see and experience,, this ensures we look for similarities before all else and in many cases this actually leads to differences not being seen or acknowledged at all,, its a kind of majority fuelled desensitisation....!
God hangs a rainbow in the sky to remind us that he will never destroy the earth by water again but by fire the next time. There is a rainbow around his throne.
Thanks!
My brain hertz lol
We live in a dome ,you solved it my theory
My eyes see 2 different tints, I am near and far sighted and the colours are just slightly different, I look out the near sighted eye mostly so when I switch its usually noticeable and the plants and clouds look different
Dude I didn't know you went to Burning Man!
I just want to say thank you for the knowledge you deliver through your videos. To be honest I can't keep my eyes off the screen while watching what you do. Keep doing what you are doing
Um is this demonstration not proving the whole firmament debacle?
I will say this to all of you beautiful people. Only those worthy are chosen. I have witnessed a dual rainbow touch the ground/s with over 50 other's. We all saw exactly the same rainbow's. It is you that is far from the kingdom that will not see the same. Your child shall not divide only you shall. You only know what you can observe.
MINDBLOWING!!!! ❤
My mate is a photographer and he captured a rainbow at night, light from the moon in the rain
I watched this video on repeat for a few hours while on acid. Mind blowing
At 11:30 I completely understood what was going on..😮😮😮
I made homemade rainbow by putting a mirror in a water bucket, and made the light come straight to the mirror, and this made a beautiful line of rainbow colors, not curved
15:08 . double foucsed it.    two times. thats ace.   can we do it again. you know. the other way too.   Steer the secondary focus. backward and forward. infinitely aaaghhh haaaaa   here we  go ...
At 8:45
Time 6:25 ish.           Thats not intense music.  Intense is fast and strong. not slow and mysterious.   I suppose these things have two components.
At time 4:04 , lol.  Error 4:04   .       Its induction in space.
This deserves way more views. Absolutely underrated
But why is the phase kick negative... like it can be positive and increase the wavelength
So isn't this called the Iridescence of water droplets?
NGL he sounds lik Electro boom
Am I the only one that sees a rainbow around the moon
Evil French man
14:29 me as a child playing with the rainbow tarp in gym class
i have been enlighted
8:10 WHAT NO WAY 42° WHAAAAAAAA
@15:39 isn't this a bit inaccurate visualization since sun rays are parallel while here the direction of light changes?
I'm more wondering why I see 4 rainbows?
Veritasium has really become one of the best YouTube channels in the world. The consistency and quality of uploads is simply astonishing.
Could you do one about rainbows the moon makes? I feel like the blue light changes it, I wish I was able to add a photo i took with the comment
If rainbows are optical illusion, then how are we able to capture them on cameras in videos and photos?
I have seen and perhaps still keep photos of whole population of rainbows in many directions over a huge snowy mountain terrain. Something like rainbow forest over the open snowy field. Wind was blowing snow from the upper mountain area and the few people I met that day were not really appreciating the rare chance of that moment.
Wow Sir your son has the same question i have had for a very long time but i had no one to ask. Thank you for this ❤😊
Tell us please, why these colors are even there? What is the source that produces the color in the rainbow?
boring
If I use a telescope and try to focus on a distant ground target under a rainbow, will it just appear slightly washed out rather than “normally” brighter?
Rainbows are truly beautiful! They shouldn't have ruined rainbows by using it as their symbol!
Now do sun dogs please
>>> See a rainbow >>> Take a photo >>> Look at the rainbow in the photo >>> Show the photo to a friend >>> Friend sees the same rainbow
light spectrum, optics and space gas masses Φάσμα φωτός, οπτική και διαστημικές αέριες μαζες
I still don’t fully understand if and how a single electromagnetic wave has any width
I'd say a line of cars  going through traffic have a really high probability of at least having 2 people witness the same rainbow at 2 different times from the same angle
Just beautiful
Dosnt this prove the earths a sphere
How old is your son that got this explanation 😅
Son: 'Dad, look at the rainbow. It's beautiful'.  Dad: Son, No two person see the same rainbow.
does this mean cross eyed people see two different rainbows?
I like this video, thank you, like like like
8:16 im a bit a caustic my self
Hello thank You for your information
and there are flerfers swaering it is the firmament lol
Truly, what a father.
i've seen a rainbow that looked like a giant circle in the sky didn meet the horizon.
K
how old is your son?
So I believe that somewhere there is a lock and like tumblers in the lock these light at the different color and secret frequencies which showing through different parts of the crystal of the glass of the lock bend and turn back and the light hits the Tumblr or the place in this lock in which it will unlock so different lights shine through this thing this locket different points hit the circuit board or I'll just call it that cuz I don't know what to call it but interact an open this lock that's locked with light light in a combination
Awesome, incredible, mind blowing etc. etc.. Thankyou Veritasium
I was explaining this to friends at school 30 years  simply by the power deduction. This video is a credit to this world.
I know it's cliché, but I wish I could like this more than once. Super informative video, and incredibly touching too. I can't imagine there's much more rewarding than fostering curiosity and instilling a love of learning in a child.
Multiple eBay stores? ZeeDrop handles them like a pro.
something i thought of while this video was playing, i can observe the same rainbow that my camera is seeing
love you bro.
9:52 why don’t you just call it what is is? The aether.
8:34 the firmament is the cause of all the caustics we see in the sky. Like sun dogs.
4:33 the medium act as a capacitor, that’s why “light” can supposedly speed back up. Light has no speed. It’s a rate of induction in the medium. The thicker the medium, the slower the light propagates. but with sound the thicker the medium, the faster the sound propagates.
"Geez dad,  Uncle Barry says it's because a Unicorn farted!"
I've studied Physics to degree level and can I just say that some of your explanations are amongst the best that I have ever heard. Credit where it is due!!
Because the earth is flat ;)
I always thought higher wavelength means lower speed. 6:08 it seems smaller wavelenth means lower speed?
LAZER LIGHT COMPUTERS,  NOT 0 N 1  BUT,   DIFFERENT CONLOR VS  AREA , POINTS.
wow,  kids can this knowledge, so readly.  amazing. AMAZING JOB....
The only reason the rainbow is in the shape of a bow, is because of the Dome in the sky (The Firmament). Rainbows artificially made with a prism are straight, not curved, but the real rainbows in the sky are always curved because they are the byproduct of the curved Dome.
Lucky son huh
Thank you, Derek, for that elegant explanation of how rainbows, in their many varied shapes, appear.
I saw a triple rainbow once.
this is his best video
vsauce michael here coded
What if two people share eyes?
hey...boss your description is not correct....your change in perspective is not complete....what about the backside ?? bbut thx for the 'rain'drop,  which POV can be projected...  'rain'bow is the reflection in our atmosphere..comparing to your raindrop it's the part You ignore....  always the same song in physics.....
You can add anything you want rainbow comes and go once every year few months I saw it  and I didn’t see it since again are lunatics  still believes Pink and purple colors are gays 😂😂😂gray is  referred to doubtful  things and bananas are sexy😂😂😂😂
What happens to the rays that do not reflect inside and passes through? Like the rays that we would see looking in the direction of the sun? Nobody talks about it. I assume thag doesn't form a caustic or a caustic strong enough for us to distinguish as a rainbow
Awesome!!!
I wonder if anyone else has ever seen a grey scale rainbow.  Dead of the night with a full moon in the swamp on some fog.  Looks like a rainbow but with a gradient of grey.
This is all good, but where are the ends so I can get the pots of gold?
I know it must have something to do with angle of the sun or something like that, but can anyone explain why you see so many rainbows in some parts of the world? For example, I lived in Northern England for a while and would see them much more than where I’m from in Southern California, which makes sense of course, but why would I reliably see so many extremely clear and complete rainbows in the Scottish Highlands? It’s not that much further north. I mean, I remember one weeklong trip where, driving around, we saw rainbows approximately 5/7 days.
"Daddy wtf are you talking about?"
Finally one not full of crazy math that I don’t understand. 😁
Grow your channel
@IlluminatingJoy I hope you love this video as much as I did!
Your videos are interesting but some aspects are confusing, mainly because iam just 15. So simplify some terms
I have a doubt. If raindrops are liquid in shape. Why do sun rays bounce back or reflect back
FANTASTIC 🎉❤ 😍
nice one!
"Why no two people see the same rainbow" - technically your two eyes don't see the same rainbow either
Conteúdo incrível!
We can see only part off full light spectrum.  Object form {fractal reflection x size /form of light[plan of choosing path to 0]}
I only had to listen to the explanation of wave forms being shortened 8 times and Im pretty sure Ill forget by tomorrow 😂
this experiment kinda proves god,well it proves creation by design. if light waves did not behave in this way,there would be no color,no life. for me there are 2 proofs for god. this one the 42* degrees at which colors change. (like in the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy 42) an the proof of good and bad. those prove to me that god is real... its to perfectly made to be just random chance.  yet god is more of a consciousness of the universe then a person. religion changes as knowledge changes.... its becomes more explained. i trust in science...for it holds true proof. yet there is a beauty,in putting you faith in god. or putting you faith in a unseen higher power. putting you life in the universes hands.  yet i would just tao it out. just follow the flow,path...as philosophers tell me.  just follow your gut.  its to perfect to be random chance. the universe is created too perfect,to just be random good luck. this experiment proves that.  that is why Isaac is associated with the apple of god. symbol of good,health,and cure.
Thnx one of the most detailed docs I saw about this. Thought I knew all about it.
Your editing is super smooth.
I took a picture of a rainbow, so more than one person could see it.
i lost at Brewster part
At tvis distance we all see the same rainbow   And what about ultraviolet and infrared
A rainbow, in its three-dimensional form, appears as a cone of light formed by sunlight—originally parallel rays—reflected and refracted on droplets of water. The distance from the Earth to the Sun is approximately 150 million kilometers. Light rays refract at the boundary between air and water, enter the interior of each droplet, reflect off its inner surface, and then refract again as they exit, all at precisely defined angles for each wavelength. Red light is located on the outer side of the rainbow, deviating at an angle of about 42 degrees to the axis of the cone, while violet is on the inner side, visible at an angle of about 40 degrees.  The apex of this dazzling cone of light is at the observer’s point of view, and its axis is the line that passes from the Sun through that point. We see the projection of all internal reflections and refractions of light within the cone as an infinite number of transparent, colored, virtual cross-sections of the cone, which form the visible circular arc of the rainbow as projected onto the celestial sphere from the observer’s point.  In the volumetric shell of this light cone lie the colored layers, which are concentric, semi-transparent segments smoothly transitioning into each other. They resemble transparent, colored, conical ice cream cups nested inside each other, following the rainbow’s color sequence: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. These color layers create the visible circular arc of the rainbow.  Interestingly, the rainbow as a volumetric body can be observed only in a single projection—perpendicular to the axis of the cone—from the point located at the apex of the virtual rainbow cone. Moreover, this rainbow is unique and unrepeatable for each observer. Every other observer sees their own rainbow, formed by raindrops located in a different spatial position.
It's a miracle.
