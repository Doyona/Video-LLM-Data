Nice movie where are you 2025
Josh knows she's pregnant so that means he has been through this before
Where is I'm in love with a poor girl movie
This is a great movie
I've seen this movie several times it a great movie
Show some love for my role model and sister Ebube❤❤❤❤
Ebube is seriously making my day just love her
This guy is annoying what!!!
Is it possible to change partner mr Vincent
I love both Maurice Sam andEbube  NWAGBO together they are so good absolutely but I still say Maurice might be part Nigerian but he’s got something else in his DNA because he reminds me of myself even though I’m part where I am, there’s something in my DNA too because his nose and his lips And I see the big difference and it’s OK because we’re all mixed with something but my nose is just a little more straighter than his and my lip on the bottom is the same size but my lip on top is the same size so we are African people but we have a little bit of different in our DNA and I think it’s beautiful because he looks great God bless you all.
Nice movie, both re good together
Too much airtime for  the friends,,  june and samy, less credit
Sam fruits  at night😂😂😂
Sam.. Here  no jokes . money
Beautiful movie 🎉🎉🎉❤❤🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

Ebube friends are so lovely ❤
😂😂 I already knew the end of this movie 😂😂😂 Maurice en 😂😂 with his you know I love you babe 😂
😂😂 I already knew the end of this movie 😂😂😂 Maurice en 😂😂
Am i the only one thay noticed that shirt especially long sleeve doesnt fit maurice sam 😂
Not interested at all
Waist of time and data
I am enjoying the movie. It is just like married couple going through a marriage interview in the US for permanent residence.
How can they be a couple  and at the same time bring girlfriend to the house in the presence of the supposed spouse. That is BS.
They should really bond as a couple in love to win the money. In fact, they should be interviewed separately at the end to prove their sincerity. They shouldn't feign anything to take the money.
before you pray psalm 109 to someone read psalm 109 :17 -20 it might come back you...just leave your battles to the Lord
❤
Beautiful story line ❤❤
Doggie style 😂😂😂😂😂
Maurice Sam is the best ❤❤❤ebube she is sweet ❤❤❤
Am here for my Maurice Sam ❤❤

The plot of this movie is so far-fetched  🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤧 to ridiculus
Le scénario de ce film est tellement tiré par mes cheveux  The plot of this movie is so far-fetched 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤧🤧 so ridiculous

Maurice sam movies is making me love love. God i need true love
They say the sex is just once😅and it’s came with pregnancy,they’re not even ashamed 😂begging the man to continue that type of relationship 🙄.
WHO WOULD EVER GET IN A BED WITH A COUPLE SAYING THEY NEED REST🥴😂 Ohhhh THE FAKE PREGNANT EX.  Why do they make pathetic storylines for some women🤦🏾‍♀️
1:19:31 He definitely took his phone when he finished his questions 🤔
This Maurice Sam is something else when it comes to romantic can't stop loving and watching his movies
See as I Dey smile like mumu beautiful end👊🥰
Maurice sam is simply the best and ebube is good in this movie too 😂😂
Nkwasia movie sei
Wow 🔥🔥🔥❤️
Manager:wow,congratulations 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why did he marry her for seven years guy what were you thinking I don’t even understand some men
My baby girl ❤❤
❤❤
One of the many best movies 😍😍😍😍 Maurice at it again
This is the best movie for the year Maurice and Ebube you guys made us proud, ride on dearies
She was just sucking ,she had attitude  from the start 😒 if she is so high level as she claims how come she opened her legs for him😅😅😅😅😅
Who wrote this script? the show should be shown not rattled on and on by the actors. Too many loopholes ! Unnecessary dialogues. It’s just …….. 🚶‍♀️
Why are they making this movies so dumb, so ordinarily they will have to wait to be told to have their stories straight for the most basic things as when they met. Mtcheew
Maurice Sam and Ebubu are perfect together in a movies
I'm here for Maurice
Interesting masterpiece ❤❤❤
I’m getting Addicted to Maurice ❤❤❤
Ebube ❤and Maurice, together made it 😊Nice movie
Maurice never dissapoints
That part where the girl said so its roasted goat am carrying abi got me laughing😂😂😂😂😂
Love supportive friends ❤
Ayeyeee MauriceSam
This movie so mice
Everywhere in this world, women hate on each other, fight with each other over a man, they never blame him for anything, or have him responsible, accountable for anything. Are we that desperate??
Editors make the movies realistic. 1million $ US, is unrealistic even for "most" game shows in the U.S. " hello wifey" You go Maurice😂🎉
Wawuuhh
A child will remain blessings from God indeed ❤❤
I want 2 join us movie industry pliz even if I pray as a house girl
Series was killing I love everything about the movie Maurice take everything to the next level I love that ❤❤❤❤
Why is she acting as if he rape her she was enjoying it
The way how June  look in Josh eyes and tell the lies about how she hated Mike and wouldn't kiss him
This Maurice guy is something else
Nice movie,very educative
This Maurice Sam reminds me ma Ex alot dey look each each yarabi🤦🤦
“You people play love in a violent way”🤣🤣
❤️❤️
The girl boyfriend deserves better
This movie make no sense
Very impressive movie ! I have watched it so many times ! Not tired !

I like the way these girls were supporting their friend.
❤❤
Cheii Maurice Sam is soo romantic 😊They was she was kissing Ebube 🔥
Lovely 💖💖💖💯💯💋💋💋💋💋💖💖💖 Mike got me laughing hard😂😂😂
❤❤❤❤
Those guys have no idea how to shoot billard.  It seems foreign to them.
I wonder how Ebube want josh to take her back after been impregnated by another man. Also, as a woman I also feel for Mike's girlfriend. It hurts a lot to loose ur man to another woman. I think everyone weren't fair to her. They should hv put themselves in her shoe they would have known how she feels. It really hurt. Aside that, the movie was lit 🔥🔥🔥
The first interview 😂😂
Here for Ebube😍❤❤‼‼
Who else is here for our ever gorgeous, elegant Ebube let’s gather here fam ❤️
Very interesting movie June's friends are the best cheers to us who read comments for living ❤❤😊

I still don’t understand what you guys are promoting in this movie, you call getting pregnant for another man while you’re in a relationship a small mistake you disgusting thing. Women hate accountability 🤦‍♂️

M is a bad boy😂😂😂😂
If you are watching from Namibia let's gather here 😂
What a nice film with Maurice ❤❤❤
Sincerely I like the actors they used for the movie but the story line is so unrealistic and I can’t place it. They used good actors for a story line that one can’t relate with. Stop using our top actors for movies that are not interesting, I watched till the end just to see how it goes and it’s because of the actors Ebube and Sam made me watch till the end not the story line coz I didn’t find it interesting. I’m just being sincere, no lesson learnt coz it’s so unrealistic.
Ebubu and Maurice should be acting together all the time cos what I love watching their movies ❤️❤️❤️❤️ nice one my people
During the questioning my heart was beating fast cause they both didn’t talk to each other then boom questioning comes
Here for Maurice Sam ❤️
Good job God bless you guys 🙏🙏
No mother, who wants to be considered a REAL mother, should ever raise a daughter as stupid as Ngozi.
When did they get time to know each other? The friends are always present
Perfect ❤❤❤
Ebube Nwagbi is perfect🤌🏾🌺
😂😂😂
Ebube Nwabgo is on a fire🔥 level of her actions, much love 💕 girl❤
This movie is just nwaaaa
Nice movie I'm enjoying it
If not ebube , I don't watch
😍😍😍😍😍🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗😘😘😊
I’m here for Sonia who is Sonita fred 🥰
Who cooks with wig almost inside the bowl abeg?
I can't get enough of Ebube and Maurice love you both ❤❤❤
Maurice Sam & Ebube Nwagbo❤ are so talented kudos to the cast on this movie 💯
💯💯💯
This Maurice ehn the way he reacts with smiles and subtle backlash when called names 😂😂😂😂😂
WOW GOOD MOVIE
Here for Maurice only❤❤❤
I did  a fast forward many times...nah nah
I love  it ❤❤ movie
I ENJOYED EVERY MOMENT  OF THIS MOVIE  A JOB WELL DONE ❤❤❤❤❤
Omo you guys are good, nice job guys I really love this movie ❤❤
When i watch Sam's movies i remember "soul desire " he made me cry😢 in that movie .the man showed pain in that movie ohhhh seriously sam is another level in talent.
Unrealistic storyline , meaningless movie !but you guys wont say the truth
Its the way ebube says ..try me 😂😂
I  really loved this movie
Can somebody tell Maurice to change his hairstyle small? It's old and giving adult kiriku 😂😂
Not sure 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Wow ❤❤
I'm here for my fav Maurice and Ebube ❤❤
The part i could not get was them allowing their partners to come over to a show that was suppose to have cameras which did not have cameras and them failing woefully in the first interview which is an 100% chance for them to leave the show and they still stays, lets not talk about that man frequent visits to the house, any professional organiser should know that there is sth wrong cos they are suppose to have spies so that no fake couple could win that kind of huge money. This is really a movie cos it not possible in reality
See me shouting in my room when Mike and his wife qualified to the finals!!😂😂💃💃
Why are they blackmailing Josh?? June messed her relationship up
Maurice said who eats fruits at night😂😂😂😂😂😂
Maurice said Doggy style 😂😂😂😂laugh wan kill me here abeg😂😂😂😂
The friends were acting as if Josh was d bad guy. His girlfriend got pregnant for another guy and they expect d guy not to be mad. How do u flog a child and still tell him not to cry. Imagine saying it was just once, it's not like it's up to ten times or more. That mentality wouldn't gain any forgiveness.
I can’t get enough of Ebube Nwagbo and Maurice❤❤❤❤🎉
I can’t get enough of Ebube Nwagbo and Maurice❤❤❤❤🎉

How many phones did maurice take to the first diary session. Let me answer i believe he has just one phone which he took along and also left with it after he was done with the diary session. So which phone did ebube take along with her after  she was done with her own diary session. I mean are you guys kidding us???
Beautiful
😂😂😂😂😂😂
This was such an  Awesome African movie,I really Loved it!😃🥰😍💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
Dog style for me 😂😂
First of all, Thank you @larrygeefilmstv fora beautiful movie description. I genuinely feel like this is what is lacking in all these channels putting movies out but they dont understand how important it actually is. I love knowing what the movie is about before watching because the description set the tone and anticipation. I haven't watch it yet but am about to so see you on the other side 😊😊😊
This guy is so arrogant for life...this one I can't
Nice movie
Now I understand why big brother they dig in
This movie is so beautiful, I love it, and  love is a good it if you meet the right person.

Fantastic movie. Sam and Ebube nailed it
Wow what a fantastic movie 🥰
I love Sam n ebube together ❤they chemistry
Movie so interesting 🤭😂
Maurice, you are among the guys that drive these small butt celebrities to go and enhance their behind and end up with fake behinds like that of our own US NIKKI MINAJ or KIM KARDASHIAN
Great movie
Can't stop loving this two ebube nwagbo and Maurice sam 🥰🥰🥰
I’m so addicted to Maurice Sam movies ❤when I just opened my YouTube and saw this first I was like woah😳I’m must watch this and I must say the film is so interesting❤really enjoyed it🎉❤

EBuBE AND MAURICE SO SWEET
You see this thing called LOVE doesn't always come in the nicest way. Who would have thought Jane & Mike will be lovebirds - Wow🎉! I have learnt one again. Congratulations to future lovers who may not have had it rosy at the beginning ❤! Be patient, nice, prayerful & hopeful, love is coming your way soonest 🎺🎷✨🥰
I love this movie ❤❤❤

I love this movie the way it end❤❤❤❤❤
Nice movie
Who go love you go love you who no go love you no go love you no matter what you do 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It's not alot but I can manage this
Beautiful mistake
I hate the lack of accountability in this movie. What did Maurice Sam's character had to be sorry for? He didn't force her. She willingly had sex with him. Her and her friends have issues talking about Mike's mess and telling June's boyfriend to forgive her because she only did it once. The women in this show are weird.
Baby boy😂
Nice movie
Great move 💯
Enjoying pa zed
❤❤❤❤❤totally enjoyed
Wow! This movie is super interesting, I learned more from it, thank God I watch it, it is indeed good for couple's to know each other, and live in truth and sincerity not in pretends. They both decide to let their proud go, learn and improve, and that lead to their victory! They fine love with each other and became true couple
love its twists and turns, not drawn out.
great movie
Great movie watching from the USA 🇺🇸
Nice movie ❤

Ebube’s acting effortlessly I really like her movies .kudos to maurice

Like seriously... I have never seen a Nollywood movie where the actors know how to play skittlebor pool.  Why do they keep including it.  Try darts now or table football... Anything else
The first interview session was hilarious 😅😅😅how can you be confident enough to be saying things that the both of you didn't discuss about like how long you've known each other and miscarriage 😅😅😅😅  As you entered to call her, you no even tip am small
I too love this guy.  I swear 😅😅❤❤❤❤❤
♥️❤️❤️♥️🔥🔥

When Maurice said “feed me” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I laughed so hard
She just quoted very dark man 🤣  You'll learn, don't play
Wait, so y'all are really mad at June's boyfriend coz he flipped when he found out his girlfriend was pregnant for another guy? Y'all are sick; that's a serious glitch in this movie
I love how the other couple switched up when they supervisors stepped in
Franka is pretty; Jude is such a wack actor🤣

Woow good friends
Maurice Sam you’re my forever favorite actor.❤
If you're not on a hurry a guy called Josh biko don't try God's goods and if he's short as well chayeeee🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
The movie is something else 😂😂
Maurice can be really petty and annoying if he wants to be😂😂😂But at the same time he sounds sweet ❤
Who raised you? My mum. She’s beautiful and she’s thick 😂😂😂…..Maurice won’t kill person
Maurice Sam is so  keep it up my favorite actor.always the best

Ehis Godplan is talented. undeniable and it's clear that he is destined for big things in the movie industry. He has a natural charisma and charm that draws people in, and he is able to connect with the audience in a way that's both genuine and captivating.

Its 12:07 am and am not sleeping as yet. I work so hard today but I have to watch some of my favorites Nigerian movie 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲❤❤❤❤
Producer's look at Mike😂😂😂😂😂😂. Good friends
Who is writing these movies ? The story line is horrible. Let me get this right woman cheat on her man got pregnant and some how she’s the good person ?
Mike and june are both wrong
Lovely Lovely movie ❤❤❤ all smiles  ☺
Maurice  sam your the boss big up you self
I like the manager face the way he looks at them
Hmmmm. Not sure about this one. Got lost in some reality intents. Concerned about Sam skills getting lost in the prong of womanizing.  Should be expanded to higher heights as Sonia has.  He certainly has the talent to do so.❤
Ebubue nwagbo have real friends
Nice movie❤️❤️❤️from Kenya🇰🇪

They say patience is a virtue. One needs true skills to pull this movie off and Maurice did it literally, flawlessly, Greatness indeed. Ebube is always amazing. I love her chemistry with Maurice.
Maurice Sam is turning out premier movies like every 2-3 days and showcasing his TALENT 😊❤😘🙌🏾🇳🇬👍🏽🇳🇬. He’s destined for GREATNESS. In Ghana we say AYEKOO meaning WELL DONE

Sonia is such a good actor  Lovely masterpiece 😊Maurice and Ebube never disappoint

Omo ads were a lot !
🔥🔥🔥🔥
The friends so supportive
Ebube never disappoint too cute a girl
Much love for sam and ebube
🥰
What's the essence of showing a scene before the movie starts, you really have to stop that it's annoying 😠
They were told to limit their guest, now they are going against the rules.
Way to go Maurice
Talking too much among friends will always lead to destruction. Sometimes we need to learn to keep our mouth shut and only discuss personal business with your partner. Why was it necessary to tell their friends exactly what they were planning to do in order to earn money in the game show especially when they knew it was a lie.
My favorite actor and actress.
It was love at first sight that was Maurice's voice
The first interview is so funny😂😂😂😂
So far am not liking it..the lady(ebune)is too much...so her friend is allowed in the kitchen but not the girlfriend...
Sonia: I'm 2 weeks pregnant Mike: Babe Babe Are you a Witch???😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Me laughing from ear to ear wondering if Mike to is a Jamaican mouth sweet😂🤪🖤🇯🇲
The gd news is that  Mike is all mine,period
San doesn't disappoint
Am finally  here,  gonna be on fire 🔥
Nah, this guy is ANNOYING!!
This movie was hilarious 😂 🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 this movie is so funny, l have been rolling on the floor here with laughter.
Maurice never disappoint,my dude
wn "mike" Maurice was confessing his love to Ebube,mr.Dickson's reaction got me 😂😂😂.imagine its coming to 12:00am cant even sleep bcoz of this.much love from Uganda 🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬
I love this movie it's 👌👌 every step I usually had goosebumps it's 🔥
Who else is hard Maurice saying that when he won the money he would have travel with sonia abroad 😁😁😁😁I don't want peace I want troubles😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love them @ Ebube Nwagbo, Sam Maurice❤❤❤❤
Poor casting, i was so irritating all the cast except sam maurice and Ebube Nwagbo are wrong, poor acting, nice script, poor casting oooo very poor casting and poor directing
❤😍😍
My Ghee Mr. Larry Gee.  90 Days Couple was Shell (funny) everything Maurice & Ebube said to his girlfriend at the beginning was 😂 hilarious to Mr. Dicksons money green piece (suit) & everything right to the end was entertaining.  Maurice & Ebube having a baby was a nice romantic surprise. Emanuella & Maurice's bestie, Maurice's crazy girlfriend, & Ebube boyfriend played there roles really good as well.  👌
God blessed you all reading and watching the movie
Here for Maurice Sam much ❤❤❤❤from 🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬
Nice movie I couldn't stop smiling from the beginning up to the end one thing I know marice and ebube on the screen trust me both of them kill it very ❤❤❤❤

these love scenes between these 2 have been sweet. looks like maurice actually used to love Ebube when he was not yet an actor. the thing is flawless 🙂
At 1:55:20 " they will learn don't play .." who heard that? Is that familiar to you in recent times?
😂😂😂😂 maurice said if I doesn't get  the money he will just sell Ebube 😂😂😂..omg
stupid movie
LOVER   BOY   MAURICE.   THE  WOMAN THAT HAS HIM  OFF   SCREEN  IS BLESSED!   WONDERFUL   CAST.  GREAT!!!!   MOVIE.
Good movie, loved it❤️
Maurice sam my lover boy ❤❤❤
June’s Friend is an “easy” Female to “Get over” on for She’s easily aroused and sexually triggered and fleshly stimulated quickly and easily just at “little boy’s” smiling and flirting with Her. She’s the Type of Female that would get heartbreaks a LOT, Nonsense.
I am so much addicted to Maurice Sam movies. I mean the dude is good when it comes to acting, his voice, his body language omg! Much love Ghana 🇬🇭 ❤❤
Is it me... or did I pick up on some idiot chewing gum in the background during the confrontation  scene in the bedroom between Ebube and Mike's girlfriend , how ratchet 🤔 can people be. Don't they keep quiet when taking these scenes?????
I believe you Sam you are great man
Who raised you? My mom she is beautiful and she is thick😂😂😂😂

👼OCTOBER 16, 2023👼  “LOOK TO ME continually for help, comfort, and companionship. Because I am always by your side, the briefest glance can connect you with Me. When you look to Me for help, it flows freely from My Presence. This recognition of your need for Me, in small matters as well as in large ones, keeps you spiritually alive. When you need comfort, I love to enfold you in My arms. I enable you not only to feel comforted but also to be a channel through whom I comfort others. Thus you are doubly blessed, because a living channel absorbs some of whatever flows through it. My constant Companionship is the piece de resistance: the summit of salvation blessings. No matter what losses you experience in your life, no one can take away this glorious gift.”  (JESUS CALLING)

This movie provoked  my spirit so much I just wanted to stop looking at it and slap some sense into these two. What  kind of childlike behavior was that,a house divided against itself cannot stand. WERE these people even serious about winning, I thought the best thing would have been to put aside their differences  and work together. I am so mad at these two little children,nonsense.
Husband of June, remember  that money does not come that easy.
