This is like watching paint dry
Party Rockin' the House Tonight is a dance song by LMFAO  (so W2 was literally correct, they have a "funny" name lol)
LOL - never seen that first game, but was fun watching the coping going on.   Oh yeah - all bonus' are MASSIVE.  Even the blues and greens.....OKay well not all blues are that great, that is standard, but the others are MASSIVe......okay okay guys, so the green and blue ones arent that great. that is expected, we need the purple and reds....  lolololol..... Edit now that ive finished the video, even PURPLES SUCK!    wow.    Will mark on my list to stay away from this one, even though I dont even gamble :D
I have never done well on this game
Thanks for the heads up. I will never play  that game. Why are games so biolatile when clearly the harder to hit bonus "should" pay more.
Might be the worst game ever made
Hur fan kan man stoppa i 13000 i ett sådant skit spel!
I hit my TV for that fly 😂 🪰 📺 💥
WBG Question Of The Day? Open Floor Question: What percentage of the time do you win the Raffle/Ticket/ Bonus ball at the casino? The one when the host calls out your name. Has your name ever been called? If so, What did you win? (Name some prizes if not) I Love the Vegas Matt team and a BIG WBG fan👌 hope he reads out my QOTD 1 day. I'll keep watching/posting 😁 From Scotland.
Good luck to you!! Buffalo pays you guys the most so keep playing!!!!!!
is there an official/unofficial "oh yeah" counter for this video?
There's an hour and a half I'll never get back😅. Gambling is not the only way to take a chance. Still love you guys
death valley is the hottest place
I have a competition idea for you guys… there used to be a game my sisters and I played called punch buggy where we’d punch each other every time we saw a VW Bug while on a road trip.  Well it would be fun to see you guys acknowledge each time you see someone wearing the Vegas Matt merchandise. Whomever spots the most people in a casino while wearing the Vegas Matt merchandise in a certain time frame (like 3 days or even a week), wins a pre-determined bet amount. (Like $500 or so to make it interesting). It would also inspire more VM fans to buy and wear more merchandise IF at the end of the competition one lucky fan gets a free prize.
Question… What did each of you do with your share of the $214,000 grand you just won the other week???Did you splurge on something you needed or wanted or did you just pop it right back in the machines??? I assume each of you have different Interests.
I know what game I won't be playing in Arizona. I've never heard Matt so disappointed while playing. Not to mention the way the game played out. Other than that, I enjoy your videos. Good luck spinning.
F that slot machine guys…
shitty game
Crappy video. Not your finest hour
This game lowkey sucked
1:06:40 "They're gonna make us" 😂
Rocket
Ticket slots is a disaster!!!!
Glad you finally got some fly-bys but the best Rocket Rumble machines are in Milwaukee (everybody knows it…)
Every time I ask a question someone steals it and they get chosen.
Trash game
Spend a hour watching the most stupid game. More power to you guys, but I would have quit after 10 minutes.
Spend a hour watching the most stupid game. More power to you guys, but I would have quit after 10 minutes.
The bands called LMFAO. 👍👍👍
Thank god that’s over 🙏
You promised us a wolf peak bonus hunt
Party Rock-LMFAO
QUESTION OF THE DAY: We are coming to Vegas on SEMA Week. We know about Shelby America and Counts Customs, but what other Car/Automotive related things are there to do in Las Vegas?
48:14 There's worse things that that, EJ.
Love your content
Fast spins is hard to watch
Boom
I sure wished you'd left this machine a long time ago! I have to say, I don't like to see the loss.
I was rooting for you guys. But that was horrible bonuses. Better luck tomorrow ❤
Fast spinning for a bonus that is not that good doesnt make for a good viewing experience
VLR is entertaining. This ej isn't.
I don't care for that one.
Yikes! That game was a dud.
Dosen't  look like fast spins are helping
WBG QOTD - How can we make game suggestions? Love the channel and keeping my fingers crossed for you guys to play multi ultra cash 88. 🤞😊
Wow ....that machine sucks to say the very least.
I have a question why do y'all bet so high regular people cannot do that nor team up with others normally the house always wins 🤔 but l really enjoy watching y'all l have seen folks bet 88 cents to $5 bet and they hit a Humounges Jpot must be at the right place right time that's why it's called Gambling 🎰 wish y'all the best 👌
Hello Vegas Matt ,Ej and crew , have you ever thought of making a video in lowest bet 20$ in 10 or 15 machines ? Double or bonus and move to next machine ! That would be fun for us the low rollers ! Good luck 🍀 always
what a waste of money
this is the worst game ever
So annoying the fast taps!! I can't watch NG because thats all he does. I know you guys are not obsessed with doing that though.
Worst game ever! 😂
In Vegas til Friday. Would love for you to sign my book! Went to the El Cortez bought another shirt but you weren’t there!
"fun game"  Errrr, really wasn't, very boring game made a very boring video imo sadly.
QOTD:  As someone that comes from a country with no taxes on gambling, can you try to explain how US Taxes work on your play, especially as I understand you have to pay on every hand pay regardless of losses incurred? Am I right about that?  You guys must have a very complex tax return just from gambling?
36:31 I was beginning to think a fly by was a myth, like all three yeti colors guarantees a triple pop.
This game is trash
What is the rocket based game where it gives you a value you “win” but you can press it to “win” more against and again. If you push it too far, it explodes?   THAT game, was much better than this sando nonsense.   I blame EJ.
Question of The Day; what is a skill that you’d really like to learn or a skill that you look at in awe?
Question of the day: will you be making GRAND merch?
The song at the beginning was "Party Rockin' by LMFAO. So when W2 said they had a funny know, he was correct lol.
I’ve never fast forwarded a VM video until today. That game was very un interesting
Back in the days you played slots for the line pays, now you can only win anything if you get a feature, sad
Fire it in there!
Just FYI it only gives you a fly bye when you get 2 or more wild multipliers...so you need two or more x2 or x3 reel spins
I love this channel's real-world experience and the emotion. Thank you guys for all that you do . But that game is not one we should play anymore .
Worst game I’ve ever seen. It’s not even fun
Remind me to never play this game.  What garbage
You guys are putting me to sleep.   To much talk, not very many decent wins.
Qotd - we know that Matt likes massages and tai chi, what does the rest of the crew do for relaxation or exercise?
I'm currently sitting in disneyland waiting for my daughter to get off a ride. while watching Vegas Matt while wearing my VM fleece!! 😂😂❤❤
Hearing W2 say 6 7ths🤣🤣🤣🤣
If it was your first time to visit Vegas, where would you stay?
Fun but Sandy 👍😂🍀✌️
Unfortunately I missed the video .. I was wondering that you guys were in my hometown! I hope you enjoyed Phoenix 😎
don't ever play that shit again
Question to Matt: if your granddaughter grows up and says gambling is bad and wants you to quit, would you comply? Or would you still play behind her back?
You encourage questions but I have asked many questions and have gotten zero answers so I don't ask any more
Arizona has lousy payback percentage.  I think most slots here in Az have about 81 % to 83% payback. Legal minimum is 80%. Which I'm sure they never check. The state is in cahoots with the casinos to squeeze dry all the suckers who play here. More money the casino makes more tax money the state gets. All the casinos are the same in the Phoenix area. They do not want to start a casino war by one casino having much better payouts. Kinda like price fixing.
Love watching and hearing the stories but this video has too many fast spins.  Too dizzy watching it.
This smells like a paid promotion
This video suspiciously felt like you were trying to convince everyone it’s a good game. The fast spins being the biggest giveaway. Even you were realising it was dragging on. Don’t know why you kept on playing it.
What a terrible game.
partying rocking the song your thinking of is    LMFAO - Party Rock Anthem
This for you and your son(?) What is life changing for a $5 player is you compared to Larry Flynt and Kerry Packer
That was amazingly brutal
I live in Oklahoma. Since you guys travel the country to different casinos, do you notice a difference in RTP between Vegas casinos and Tribal casinos. comparing the convenience of Tribal casinos vs traveling to Vegas casinos which includes airfare or driving expenses, as well as hotel expenses. Would love to see you guys in Oklahoma.
Question of the day: which slot have you played recently with best return rate beside buffalo with the 200,000 grand
Can’t believe I wasted my time watching this Sando of a slot machine. You guys must Ike loosing.
I’d much rather see wolf peak
QOTD:  You all have such mellifluous and engaging voices.  Have any of you ever considered radio DJ as a career?
🎉😂❤
Guys, it wasn't paying the WHOLE time.   Why not EVER switch machines to one that's hot or paying ?
Besides the recent grand jackpot what is y’all’s most memorable win? Big or small
So have you ever used your free play on a machine bet max and hit ?We saw a lady do it....she bet 66.00, first bet, free play, she won the grand 66,000.00 It's unbelievable,  but saw it.
I don’t get it.. that does not look fun!! Even if you can afford it!!
WBG QOTD:  Each of you Name one trait you admire in each of the others on your group. No duplications.
Question of the day from a UK viewer  Inspired by this channel and over at a Kansas City hotel casino I decided to run a small experiment betting 2 dollars or as close as on 5 of the main machines you play;   Bull blitz Spooky link Buffalo link  Golden drums dancing drums Autumn Moon  Which do you think paid most winnings (clue - only 2 came out in profit).  Answer on tomorrow’s comments!
QOTD: In your opinion if you were only gambling a hundred or two would you say its best to bet max bet at 1cent denom or minimum bet at a a higher denom? What strategy would you prefer? Huge fan. Love you all.  Thank you for the entertainment 🤑
This game not very interesting.
Question of the Day: With football season underway, are any in the group partaking in the big football Survivor contests or any of the other ones? There is also a big $100,000 entry fee contest this year. If not would you consider it for next year and maybe you could play the NFL slot each week to help make your picks!
I skipped over the video as I didn’t like that game. Do more competitions, far more entertaining and more dragon cash and Buffalo link.
QOTD: You guys ever though about making a podcast? And if so what would it be called?
muito legal
My question of the day is: There are so many places a viewer could leave a comment, like here on YouTube or Instagram, plus many other platforms. Where do you pull your questions from and is it only from live feeds? Do viewers need to pay a special fee to make our comments noticed on a live feed?
Thanks for letting me know if I ever see this game I should run
Would've been way more fun watching y'all battle it out trying to double 2500 to 5000 and then 5000 to 10000 and the most you could've lost is 10k😆 it's really getting boring just watching relentless spins, hype this channel up with a slot battle so we can cheer for our fav player and mine would be EJ! He handles the hate so well haha
Sorry guys, this is definitely the most boring game I’ve ever seen you guys play
Who takes the days you lose the hardest and who enjoys the winning days the most
QOTD: what’s the age difference between all of you? Is it EJ, W2Jesús, WBG, Vegas Matt ? If so how many years?  And WBG & Casino Manager Adam are awesome genuine people! I chose to take the opportunity to introduce myself and my wife at Starbucks & WBG gave us stickers. I got 3! Been following since 5K followers 🍻 come to Oddfellows on a Tuesday for a drink and karaoke 😉 we have N/A
My wife and I went to the el Cortez Monday and Tuesday to hopefully meet y’all. But no luck. We bought some merch. She loved the vibe there. Win another Grand
Dare I say that game is ass
It’s funny that you guys like this game. We have it here in Canada and I have never seen anyone on this machine- always empty!
Matt needs hand restraints during bonuses to cut back on those fast spins.
Stupid game, boring as crap, you really can’t beat the links games, Phoenix link, lightning link, dragon link all the dollar storms. Just my opinion, better luck next time guys, some of these games are just not fun to watch. Unfortunately, best of luck.
WBG-QOTD...   Nobody is sure of what the future will bring us or where we will be.   We can only guess or predict what paths we will be taking years from now.  Where do you predict you will be 5 or 10 years from now?
??? EJ and friends how do you know when its maxed out on spins?
What a build up of a game and very disappointing bonuses. Can't believe you guys hung in on that one. Game keeps teasing with the high values up top and never hits. Nah
Day 25 of what the heck was this game! And asking for the bad lick bracelet! 🎉
Maybe its a fun game cause your pushing buttons and money at stake.  To watch you guys play that game was not fun.
this video is too long I had to take 3 breaks
No more fast spins please! Especially during the bonus. It disrupts the timing that got you the bonus. This claim is unsubstantiated, but nevertheless accurate. 😂
W2 sounds exactly like  "Kronk" on The Emperor's New Groove. Lol.
Between Matt fast spinning and accidental fast spins, no good pays, that was the most irritating, boring, unexciting, total disaster flop of a video I've ever watched. Please go back to Peppermill Reno or Los Vegas. An hour and 25 minutes of my life wasted I'll never get back 🥱
WBG QOTD: What did WBG write in the letter to himself at 18 that he’s never read?
That game was totally boring, you should play more Frankenstein
Anyone else’s ears hurt after watching this vid, or was it my TV?  I think the win-ability needed to be turned down.
IDIOTS
1 hour on same game same bet....boring.
EJ was wrong. TERENCE CRAWFORD ☝🏽
Stop it with those F'in quick spins!
I wasted 1hr 25mins watching the worst game ever. More bull blitz lads!
Chase a bonus only for it to suck hard
Ugh...what a disaster
Looks like fun
WBG QOTD: Venice is home to the world’s oldest operational casino. Do you have a casino bucket list of places where you would like to gamble but haven’t been?
I have a question for you guys. So back in the day i had several favorite vegas eateries. Like Excalibur had a place called Sherwoods i believe, that had a fantastic Reuben Sandwich. Its long gone now. What were some of your favorite vegas eateries that are now long gone?
Hey Vegas Matt and friends, I know this is a long shot, I have been watching you guys for years and love your content. Im not one to ask for help but me and my fiancée are really wanting to have a baby, but we can't afford anything right now, so I was curious if we were to make a gofundme for IVF treatment and to help get us out of debt so we can actually survive, I know it's alot but would you be willing to help us? Like posting our gofundme or anything. Thank you. Lots of love BTW! Keep up the great work!
Jeez that purple was a letdown 😮
Ohhhhhhhhhh VM, EJ The worst video I’ve ever watched on your channel.  You must have thought you could have had fun but reading all of the comments you have no where to go but thumbs down 👎
WBG QOTD: Would you rather sing everything you say in a day or dance everything you do for a day? Long time watcher from New Zealand, my fave moment of the week was W2’s reaction when you hit the Grand 😂
I watched you play rocket rumble on a live stream and you won huge , vegas mom won too on the machine next to you
WBG question of the day…. You asked for off topic questions.  Two questions.   In all your worldly travels, have you ever been to Bermuda?  I would love to go but my husband thinks we would be sucked into the Bermuda Triangle.  Do you believe that exists?
Hour and 25 minutes on that garbage game chasing a counter. Gross!
I usually don’t get bored this was excruciatingly long and boring!
Terrible game, I stopped watching at 45 minutes.. hope you won!
All the machines have a score. What machine do you hum in your head after you leave the casino the most?
Fast Spins in a Bonus - IDIOT.
Black eyed peas...song i think??
EJ is a TOSSER…whinges like a 9 YEAR OLD
Everyone hating on EJ, but Matts negativity on literally everything thats not a grand recently is getting old! Winning $1200 on a random spin is a complete disaster. Playing for over an hour and ONLY being down a few thousand is a complete disaster.....
what a junk slot machine. i would only play that slot if it was freeplay.
*WBG QOTD* : Speaking on randomness do you guys believe games like Rocket Rumble or Regal Riches are completely random every spin in the free games or is the amount you win determined when you pop the free games and we are just seeing the script of how we got to the total? Thanks for all the awesome content!
More crickets needed ej
Purple monkey dishwasher? You're going to pay for that comment!
Big praise for the machine and then dusted 😢
47:45 loved seeing an old lady eating a lollipop
Ainsworth, Aruze and Bluberi is rubbish ! My opinion. The best is always Aristocrat ! Good luck, guys !
Very very boring game its really sad
Come to desert diamond if ur in town for the funeral
QUESTION OF THE DAY!!!  When you guys won the 200gs how did that work with paying the taxes on it ? Did you guys work out how much it would be and Vegas Matt take a bigger share to cover the taxes on the win or did you guys do it another way ?
How often does graffiti guy come?
This game put me to sleep
Sorry but that game sucked 😂
Hey guys, thanks for sharing. Didn't really like that machine
Complete Sando 🤣
Wow 😮!!!
What an awful machine, did they pay you to go there and play!?!?
Day 2 of asking you to play dynamite pop slot
What a complete disaster in more ways than one. Fun game? I disagree that was boring as Hell to watch
You were really out of it on this game.
The Rocket was a dud.  I think the game is boring without any line pays.  The longest video with zero results.  Cross it off your list forever!
Hey Everybody!!! Leave  E.J Alone!!!! He is great!!!
Spins are too fast. Slow down.
That game is absolutely trashhhhhh
That was heartbreaking at the wnd
That game was ass
Sorry, Vegas, Matt but after watching the video, I see why Nevada did not bother to pick up that slot machine because it’s ass
Rocket Rumble is the best 🎉
I think the one next to it , is worth a shot
You convinced me... Never to play that game ever. Or even watch a video of some one playing it.  😢
Interesting game, not my fav. But appreciate you showing it to us! 🎉🎉🎉🚀🚀🚀🚀
Stop whining Matt....
I'LL KEEP SAYING IT, "MASSIVE" IS NOT A NOUN!!!!!!  Stop saying it's a massive.  It's a massive what??????
If a tree falls in the woods and no one is there to hear it, is it still EJ’s fault that it fell. 🤔😂
That rocket game sucks.
This is a boring game troops it's a sando. Finding it hard to watch.
QOTD, if you won a 100k in freeplay and you said hey thanks but I've got a really expensive surgery or something similar how much would they let you take as a cash amount, it kind of tells you what the RTP is.
In the words of WBG that game is ass.. seriously ass
I only come here for the blackjack
WBG Question? of the day  What does the Crew think about the questions that WBG chooses and be honest because some are really Sandos😅
Please don't do fast spins, they make me dizzy and I love watching you every night.
Finally no buffallo link
Idiots 😂😂 how do you lose thousands and thousands every day all-day and try to act like that's ok ? 😂😂😂
Ur chasing  the rabbit  that nvr stopped  to shit😢😮
Loll don't matter who pushed  it same result. Yo. Maui strong 💪 ❤️ 👏
Good no. Extra spin & no win. Ur 4 idiots   in alinement. Come on man. Get out already. U blew ur 215k win already  ouch 😢😂😮😅😅😅
It's almost like you guys just want to lose thousands. Horrible game choices and just dumb wagers. "Fire it in there" is one of the many lame catch phrases that actually cost you money instead of winning it. Down 300k and playing some of the worst slots possible. Take some time off, regroup, these streams have been dog shit lately. Sure, hit the grand for 200k but you're giving it all back and will be down 500k in no time.
WBG question is the day.... What did you guys do as a teenager?
That game is the new wolf peak
Can't believe  u played this ass game so long. But split  4 ways not bad. Wbg is the man. Humorous  punns on every  subject. Lol genius. 😅
I got a question for you. Do you guys have a favorite old school slot machine? Mine is still "The Munsters"
For the love This was the most 🤐
QUESTION OF THE DAY… HOW MUCH TIME FO YOU GUYS SPEND TOGETHER OFF SCREEN.  Thanks. Love your channel 😊
This game is a disaster
Sando game! Played it way too long! Idiots! 😂
Time to play Buffalo tomorrow.  Get that $13,000 back!😊
When I saw this video was way over an hour I thought it was going to be epic but I was wrong. I dozed off twice. Very underwhelming.
Come on VM gotta know when to fold um...That had to have been the longest and most boring Video to date...watched the first 15 minutes  then fast forward to the end...
Will you ever come to Pittsburgh and do your casino experience on this side of the east coast?
Boring!!!
NASA call. They said....Hu.
SHAKE IT OFF Vegas Matt! 54:28
You all should do a side bet with Vegas Matt every accidental fast spin he does he owes everyone a wheel spin 😂😂😂😂
Luv you guys watch almost every night before I go to bed .this game is a snooze.  Praying yall hit something. There are virtually no line pays
Ya know - the haters always whine.  I think you were trying to provide new and different content
I thought I was watching this game forever. I kept looking at the time of this video. Wow!  1 hour 25 minutes and 34 seconds of my life. My butt hurts!
Hate the fast spins guys
🫣 I can't look at this train 🚂 wreck
Why you guys don't give us finally the "Wolf Peak 🐺" bonus?  We asked for long time...  So please play the slot until you hit that bonus
idk why you guys havent learned yet, to stop "chasing" counters/features... i have yet to remember 1 big win where you guys chased anything and came out victorious... idiots
WBG QUESTION OF THE DAY. Have you guys thought of playing in Minnesota casinos? It would be amazing to have the crew come to Minnesota and have a meet and great and group pull. Thanks for entertaining us for the last few years
Come. With the fast spins.
Don't like the rocket rumble game and I love to gamble  but not impressed with this game
Go Birds 🦅
Reading the comments, I guess I was the only one sickened by “party rockets” over and over again. I hope I never hear that phrase again for the rest of my life
I hate the fast. Spins.
Way to much wishing for party rockets. That never ends well
17:14 - I've been watching you for what feels like years, maybe like 2, or at least every day for the last 18 months and i assure you all, you don't need to be new to the channel to think you're crazy... QOTD, VM's favourite Thanksgiving Meal and is it in fact true that it's possible to get all the blue pigs?? I heard a furphy about this from a guy one time but i couldn't believe it to be true :)
Gotta stop hitting the button during the bonus
WBG Question! What’s the deepest run each of you have had in a poker tournament? I’m genuinely curious I googled WBG trying to learn your secrets and came up blank.
One of least interesting machines you’ve ever played. . . It even made for more subdued conversation among all of you. . . No fun. . . For anyone.
Well maybe you are insane! Everyone is saying it
Arizona gaming is a joke. I gambled there one time and never again
From Bert in Arizona.  How many hats does EJ own?  EJ is cool.
😭
I'm hoping they don't get that game approved anywhere else.  I had a hard time watching this one.  Keep up the good work though, appreciate the videos.
WBG QOTD: If the casino decided one day to turn off bonuses on slot machines, what would be each of yours go to machine for line pays?
Megabucks obviously W2 easy answer
Actually pretty boring watching fast spins not a fan
Shout out to the fly on reel 1 at 40:40
This video is the most I've ever fast forward thru
Okay guys, I'm convinced to NEVER play this game.
This viewer says that game sucked idiots behinds
WBG QOTD. Day 57, have any of you guys ever lost a large amount on a machine and had someone come in right behind you and hit a large payout or even a grand right away, if so how did you react? Keep up the good entertainment!
I've had prostate exams that were more exciting!!!!!
“The band has a funny name” it’s lmfao…😂
Fast bets seem like such a waste.  I mean, if I'm just gonna piss the money away, triple or quadruple the bet and let it play.  You'll piss it away just as fast, with the potential to win more.
This game is terrible 😢
Rocket is no Regal.
I have to agree with everyone, I had to stop watching the video in the middle because it was just dragging.  Even fast forwarding didn’t help.
What a shocking game,ill give it a flyby.
The worst game i have seen yall play. And most boring im glad yall got wrecked just so yall wont ever play that again!
Anyone else dislike this game?
WBG question of the day. Vegas Matt and EJ. I've recently heard VM refer to W2 by his first name a few times. When not filming do you call W2 and WBG by there nicknames or by there first names?  Thanks guys for all the entertainment. I started watching about 7 months ago and watch every day you guys are the best!!!
Terrible game. Extremely boring.
Boring game 🥱
🔥🔥🔥🔥
This was the first time I kept fast forwarding through the video to see why you liked this game. About the only positive thing I can say is this game is a game I would avoid at all cost.
I mean honestly all the bonuses save the one green one for 4k were sandos.  Did you really think the purple would just magically be worth 15k???
Worst game ever. Glad it isn’t in Vegas!
LMFAO sings Party Rock
"I want one of those balls to spit out a purple mouse."  W2Geez is either gambling or dropping acid.
Not a great game
LMAFO is who sings  the party rockin song 1:20
It’s great for marketing. They doubled the time people watched and raked in the money
What the hell guys trying  more ADS?C too make more money with ads every two minutes-- pure crap - in those I have seen 6 LAUFENN tire ads what a name  Captain's Log?  no he is still Laufenn, will be a bit late today, moew prune tomorrow.
Yeah
Wow frustrating ending
I would NEVER play that machine again if that happened to me lol but at least we get to see the true side of gambling, it's not always the expected outcome😅😅
WBG question of the day. How close to 100 would the red have to be for you to chase it on rocket rumble? Since you played for so long and didn’t get many reds
We have that in WinStar but very rarely see anyone playing it (for good reason 😳)  Was hoping y’all had a better outcome!
Pretty boring game. One of the few times I skipped to the end.
Didaster
Have it in Kansas. I am not a fan of it lol
Been following you guys for years .. watching videos everyday. That was probably one of the worst viewing experiences not being able to see how much you guys were betting/winning/losing. Hopefully this isn’t a new way for you guys to do videos .. not showing the viewers the “numbers”
This is almost as bad as when y'all lost 100,000 dollars.
I have some merch and would love a nice dry fit polo for the cruise. Any chance of adding polos back to the shop? When I went to buy one some time ago my size was sold out.
Worst video ever. Sounds like whole bunch of kids olaying video games. Dumb game!! I cant believe people would watch this boring video
Love the Top Gun reference 😂❤
Agony
Surelly EJ idea!!!
I feel GENUINELY bad for y'all watching that. That was so painful I'm sorry. Like awful.
Wolf peak please
Garbage garbage game. The poster child for all hat and no cattle, lol. Seriously, those stupid little rockets flying up there, mean absolutely nothing. Nothing. Those flying upeward rockets are designed  to deliberately distract the player from to the bottom, and see that he's winning peanuts. This game is almost criminally misleading. Evil.
This first game...boring...terrible
Rocket Rumble is TWASH!! Money Black Hole.
You guys are idiots hahahahaha fckn hell
Rough, rough video. I’d stay away from this one and fire it in there on Wolf Peak instead.
Go for the Red Gentlemen 🎉
Worst game I ever seen you guys play
Thank you that game sucks
Boring game
You can come to WinStar and play this game
This game sucks!!!
Cool game, brutal outcome... still a great video fellas!
Your fast spins suck see ya
When you chase, 99% of the time, you get burned. Sorry, but no surprises here and you know better as a seasoned gambler. Thank you for your honest content.
Fun video to watch. Some day I hope to actually bet high enough to get some valuable player points.
VM, "Maybe they will start coming quickly?" W-2, "Some people don't like that." Best moment in the video. Man, that is one frustrating game
Love the fast spins
That was the dumbest game I have ever seen. You spend 16 k on that but only give wolf peak and fire link games 10- 20 minutes tops????
I’m thinking you guys are insane for playing this game! 🤯
Hhhmmmm.. turkey Sando
QOTD - Hey Matt, will you be recording your book for Audible? I like listening to books.  Pleeeease
This was the most terrible slot machine in the world, come on guys this was horrible.
Horrible game. Can't bare watching it
Vegas Matt a new video idea like Buffalo Link or any game play two machines same game side by side at the same time on video.With bonus buys and side bets
What a terrible machine I can't believe you guys stayed the whole session lmao
You should hope they never bring this game to Vegas. This game sucks.
The game is corny.  Can’t believe you flew to Arizona for this dud.  Vegas doesn’t have it because it stinks!  Run from it and don’t look back!😜
That was so anticlimactic that it made me laugh. Love that you show the reality of gambling sometimes. Just as entertaining as the wins!
Question of the day: Do you actually think fast spins change the outcome of the spin, or just spins the reels/gives you a faster result?
I don't understand the comments, they always say play something other then buffalo. They play something else they enjoy it and people still crap on it.
The fly by was definitely broken on this machine
WBG’s Question of the Day: If you were tasked with designing a new slot machine, what would your ideal machine look like? what bonuses/features would it have? (ie: hold n spin, cascading wins, multiplier free games)    what would the bonus frequency to line pay ratio be? would you incorporate a “buy a bonus”? etc?  love the videos as always guys!
What a boring game
I still remember watching ROCKET RUUUUUMBLE for the first time on a livestream from you guys. If this session ran as well as that with Graffiti Guy and Big Check Energy then I'm sure people would like it. Please livestream more sessions!
iPhone!!
This was actually a fun video to watch. I'm sorry it didn't turn out for y'all though
Horrible watch.  Boring game.   Dud.
First time with a negative comment, but this is the first time we’ve ever had to fast forward through a video because the game was so bad! This was worse than watching paint dry! Please…PLEASE…never play this POS ever again!
Most boring video you have ever made. Fast forwarded through a ridiculous 1.25 hours of stupid gambling
Not a great game at all 😢
Has Vegas Matt ever gone by his first name?  If he did, why did he switch to Matt?   Is the mob after him?
Question of the day: who is most likely to win in an encounter, a grizzly bear or silverback gorilla? This is an on going debate amongst my friends and even most guys out there. Want to get your thoughts and perspective on this from you guys. Hello from Elgin Illinois (home of Grand Victoria Casino)
We had this machine in Tampa Florida Hardrock Casino and they got rid of it.  It sucked.
I always fast spin i find myself to win better you forcing the machine to pay out
GOOD LUCK QUESTION: you guys are all markedly witty and intelligent.   I'm really curious-- when you guys were kids,  what did each of you want to be when you grew up?  Follow up question: do you have any regrets if you did not end up doing what you thought you would?
But just keep putting money in it. Complete sando guys. Ridiculous!
WBG QOTD: How do you be a great husband?
Wow there are a lot of hating people in the comments today. I am not a fan of this game but you guys always entertain being your conversation.
I will always be a fan. But, this one was way too long. 40 to 45 minutes is perfect. Just constructive criticism…
Yeah I think today may be my last day watching these videos. It’s just gotten so monotonous and boring. An hour and a half video playing one single slot machine. I watch these videos so that I can live vicariously through them. I never go to the casino and play one game the entire time on there and then leave.
My husband loves playing Rocket on cruise ships...looks like a huge SANDO to me. 😂
You went to Arizona to play this “amazing game” when all we really want is Wolf Peak.
Hate that game 😂
In the famous words of WBG that rocket game was ass!!
Hey guys heading down the first to come gamble.
Not impressed
EJ is absolutely right, I'm watching this game for the first time and I think you're insane. It's 17 minutes in and so far it's terrible. Love you guys. Qotd. What's the wordt machine you've ever played and why?  Andy UK
What a brutal game.
Iphone, please. It's our anniversary next month and that would be a great gift for my wife.   Can we get it signed from all of you if she wins it.  I'm happy that you guys are here this week.   Sorry that we couldn't make it to WHP, Margie works, and I'm a stay home 60yo dad with an amazing 14 month old boy.  I'm taking the family to WHP on the 13th and staying overnight for our anniversary.   Hopefully, you will be there at the casino, and I can introduce you to my amazing family.   Thank you all for the awesome entertainment.
It was far far from a fun game. It was a complete and utter boring disaster! Do not ever ever play that game again. If you do, you're going to lose a lot of subscribers.
when y'all get a big win or bonus you should say LET'S GO more.... totally original no one else is saying it
The everquest quest completion noise on the rocket game snapped me out of my stupor.
Thanks for sharing, Vagas Matt . I think people should only post nice things .
watching in the airport on my way to vegas. hope i get a chance to meet the legends of the league.
Nice in my neck of the woods Let’s go Vegas Matt! 🎰💰💰💰
That was painful.. if we never played that game again it would be too soon :(
48:45 the game gave you a flyby as a way to stop you from doing fast spins
lol team Sando
That was boring as hell guys
How terrible ugh. These are the sessions that infuriate me. Definitely lots of bad words, but I'll keep that to myself.
yeah no shot buddy ya’ll got a check for promoting this game or else you wouldn’t have been playing it, that game sucks!!!
That game sucks.
That was such a boring game. I fast forward the video because it was not very entertaining
Question of the day- for EJ - you have such strong feelings about gum chewing, what are your thoughts about toothpicks in public places? Thanks for all the entertainment and helping me get my fix! Fire it in there!
Not a fun game.  Thumbs down.
Wbg said this was an engaging game! Is he crazy? This was a horribly boring game and nothing fun about it at all. Stop lying.
Rocket Rumble!
Crap game and video.
let's face it vegas matt just isn't listening to wbg ....... period
If Iran attacked Turkey from behind, would Greece help?
Didn't like that game
The only way to watch this video is to fast forward to the end.
How do you not get bored living a life, being entertained by randomness that will always be a loss to the player. They actually say, gambling addicts are addicted to the loses and not the winning.
Vegas matt needs to watch this video to understand just how freaking boring tonight was. If he cares at all about his audience, which it doesn't look like he does, he needs to watch us and realize how much suffering we did tonight
Yuck
Question of the day: Gambling together day and night-Do you ever get tired of each other? If so you can’t tell. Love watching the channel.
I had to fast forward.  I will never play this game.
That game was so boring I was contemplating making my own rocket rumble…🚀
I played this game 2 times and got wrecked like to guys. I played it bc of the first time I saw you guys play it. I honestly didn't like Rocket Rumble at all. It is not too exciting to me.
That was a rough one today 🫤
I just ordered your book, Vegas Matt.  Can’t wait to read it.  My middle name is Matthew too.
We had that game in MN a year ago. I’m surprised you like it. It’s a Bluberi game like Devils Lock, that flame game you refer to as Banana’s Foster. This one was in Alabama 2 years ago, I used to watch another influencer play it there all the time and not do very well.   Good luck trying to get it in Nevada! I wouldn’t be surprised if it had already been there and was taken out due to low coin-in.
That was a nightmare come true. I stay away from that game.
I'd put that game in the same category as huff and puff sando City. I hope it never comes to Nevada.  I hated it, and i'm sure that you hated losing all that money. But you guys are the best, just so you know.
I hate this game.
Don’t Play $0.10 it doesn’t pay out. Play $1 or $0.50 pay out is better.
Come on fellas, don't insult Regal Riches.
There'll be no re-entry for you! (That's what she said)
Trash
How'd you enjoy our great smokefree casinos in Arizona? How does the smoke filled Vegas casinos play into your everyday routine?
Question of the day. What did she say when you won the grand??
Did you guys notice the typo on the screen 18:31 "curent bet"
Alright, ok to the power of infinity
No money no Fun🎉
I hate this game
Don’t pick on eh for calling out the c’:/m shots
They have rocket rumble in northern CA at Chicken Ranch which is about 25 mins closer to the freeway than Black Oak
Gotta try again… that’s gambling
Quite an unattractive, un enjoyable game. Fast forwarded through most of the episode, sadly. Look forward to tomorrow.
With all this tai chi talk Matt should start his own tai chi fitness centre
Fun video, sorry you lost though. You guys were awesome......Nobody negative at all. Made the video funny. I love you videos where you chase counters too
Question . . .do you think the R & D departments of game manufacturers watch your videos for recommendations and come out with better games .  And other than winning all the time . . . Matt, what would you all like to see in a game?  Watch you every day.  Thank you!
That was the hardest thing I ever watched sorry guys
Yikes thanks for sharing that disaster it was fun though.  Onward 🌈
Not funny yall lost but every time you guys mention how great this game is i comment that its the worst game ever invented and crickets. Glad yall experienced it. Not glad ya lost but it sucks. I got 35 purple on a 6.50$ bet and won 37$ after seeing yall play it the 1st time and never again. Took 2k to get 1 purple and not even 100 dollars back. That game isnt in Nevada cause its a rip off
❤
"Party Rock" is the song by LMFAO Classic track.
Super fun game guys. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Thankyou for a fun Friday🫶🏻
And that is why I dont chased anymore. But, great session! 😂🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
WBG question of the day besides gaming and casino's what's something else you guy's do in Vegas?? What's one way or more that you like to unwind??
My wife and I have been watching you all for a few years now, and tonight was one of the least enjoyable nights we’ve ever spent time watching. We watched as you kept doing the fast spins, and my wife is a mathematics teacher. She tracked the game doing the spins, versus watching you hit the fast spins, and the probability changed by 58%. The fast spins are crushing your win loss ratio, therefore it made watching you lose very unenjoyable. We both said that had it been the first time we watched, we would’ve never  watched you again. This is one of those games where you leave the Fast Spins away!!!!!
If you say rocket boost one more time I'm going to scream. Do not ever play that stupid azz game again.
You’re losing 15,000 on the end you just get $1300 EJ you’re not right you are not predicting correct slots. Don’t have to pay you the way you think that game is stupid.
Not my favorite. Do something else
You keep talking about how fun the game is but were you there? Do you realize how boring that game is? If not, you got a serious problem.
Thanks again for the XA45K update! Loving every XA45K I own!
So they knew you were coming. You're gonna get wrecked.
Tonight was the most boring slot machine I have ever seen in my life. Talk about boring. The heck out of your audience. Is that what you're going for now EJ, to bore the heck out of us?
I will never  play Rocket Rumble. 😂
I'll never get that hour and 25 minutes back. Please don't do that again...
Vegas Matt complaining about the $2500 load in limit has to understand those types of rules are instated to stop certain activities such as laundering I know not everyone does it but a few bad apple's ruin it for guy's like you..
After 7500 I don’t care what’s supposed to happen. I’d be gone.
Only time I've ever disagreed with Vegas Matt in an outro. That game was absolutely agonizing to watch.
Awful game total disaster
Question of the day: when you won the 211k grand, at the beginning of the video, you mentioned everyone there (wbg, w2, Matt, ej and Kevin) all had a piece of the results that day, as if it was a group poll. However the yearly stats were reduced by the full winage.  Can you explain that in terms of your stats?  Shouldn’t it only be reduced by the winage for Matt, and possibly ej?
I want to reach through my phone and shake you every time you fast stop in the rocket boost bonus 🤦🏽‍♂️😅
I hope they still have it but in 2 weeks I’m goin to Atlantic City, they have a South Park slot machine that is no where in Vegas and I’m dying to play it 😂.
Question of the day: If you all could “build a bonus” and combine features from across any games, what would you choose?
A better name for that game is "What Might Have Been." One more Rocket," "One More in Row 3." I'd rather see you lose on a game like "All Aboard." You guys are awesome though!!!
😴😴😴😴
Debbie downer commentary in the back
How do I claim my 220% bonus tokens on $XA45K? Just build my wallet and deposit?
$XA45K just broke all-time high again, well predicted.
That rocket game needs a rocket up the jugular!! 😮
CASH EXPLOSION Fort Knox is my favorite game.  It’s an Oregon lottery game.    You GUYS would ❤ it !!!
that sucked. sorry my dudes
I hate the fast spins,
Imagine saying “I almost bought $XA45K early.” Couldn’t be me.💸💸💸
Question-  I know you guys play everyday, I’ve been long time fan (the first of your thousands fan😊)  Seeing some days there is a loss, and obviously comes the frustration-doesn’t it piss you off and you want to take a day off?!?
This game sucks how do you guys like this ?
Gentlemen, I watched the video before I commented. I was going to say have fun and you kinda did with that great results. Again, coach Z and his prediction was way off.
That game sucks
Horrible purple bonus 😢.
Hope you get a lot of free Starbucks playing that game!!!
Fast spins mixed in OCCASIONALLY with regular spins changes up the timing.  NOT every spin which loses what could have been a win.  The wins come after a BRIEF couple fast spins then a regular spin.  This was not smart.  Who are  you guys trying to convince?  I watched one of your year old videos today and the VIBE was much more entertaining and positive and less arrogance.  Maybe that’s what fame does to people.
Please never play Rocket's again unless you're getting endorsements. So you can play Buffalo another day. Keep that game in Arizona. 👎
Day 28 of commenting that you guys should play Invaders from the Planet Moolah.
Remember when you guys played this game in Wisconsin and you guys kicked the butt on it but tonight there is no way I would put all that money in that machine❤
We have Rocket Rumble in Michigan
Hey Matt just watched your Island Hunters episode season 1 episode 5 on HDTV. I didn't realize that your whole family was there as well.❤
Been playing slots for years , just not sure how the button works
Okay, honestly this was an annoying video to watch. You could tell VM was super frustrated with the game with every spin being a fast spin, and it wasn’t enjoyable.
Wow what a bad game I feel like I wasted my time watching this video and I like all of your guys videos this one was bad
If you had to work at a concert stadium one time in your life. What would your job be?  Me usher, get to watch show and show people where to sit. Easy peasy.
Bring back fast spins
I'm not a fan is it just me??
I'd rather watch you get wrecked by 10 machines as see you get raped by one.    Ugh. You guys have helped me get through some very tough times.  I love you no less.
Question of the day about question of the day: If reading the question of the day seems to bring the bonus, preamble included. What about having WBG continuing to talk while the bonus is going to continue bringing the luck?
Sorry guys, love you lots, but that was a terrible game. Thank goodness for fast-forward.
What a disaster and talk about Boring . I’d rather sit and people watch . Then again that’s what I’m doing here hahaha people playing slots
That’s the dumbest game I ever seen. He’s just losing money on it and you’re praying to get your money back. You should’ve never play the game again. It’s a total disaster.
I remember the first time I got a fly by
Sorry Vegas Matt, but never do outkast dirty like that ever again
I love you guys more than anything but do you think I want to watch you get wrecked by the same machine for an hour?   I stopped watching after an hour.  Move to a different machine or do something to entertain me.  Do a victory lap blindfolded.  I don't care but you gotta do something.
EJ, have you read the Izaak Walton's "The Compleat Angler?"  If so, what impact, if any, has it had on your angling and gambling? Many thanks.
Don’t like it.
Just personal preference. Fast spins are the most annoying to watch lol.
Game is slow
WBG QOTD: I dont ever really comment on these but since you encouraged it... What all are your favorite genres of music/artist? Personally I am a Phishhead and I follow them around the country. Unfortunately couldn't get tickets for their shows at the Sphere but I did stream it!
very much disliked that game, I also am not a fan of regal riches, love watching each day!
The end can’t come fast enough. I will never play this game.
Video idea how about a big shot at wolf peak like $50,000 or more at 2million subscribers
That game is awful,no pays,must be a Indian casino 😢😅a real rip off
Question. Do you set a budget to play and hope for a win or just film a set amount of minutes?
Who picked this awful game? Not fun to watch either. Bonuses are boring and a buffalo knock off to boot. Who ever did pick needs to take a long break from picking what you guys do.
Long time subscriber, first time questioner! 😂   What slot from the past that you used to play would you like to see modernize with today’s technology?
So glad you lost on this garbage, hopefully you won't play it again.
Question of the Day - have you ever had to stop filming because someone let one loose? Who is the most gaseous and who is the one you need to run from after they let one loose? 🤣
This game reminds me of Regal Riches.  It teases you with the hope that you will land on a color that has a lot of spins, then it lands on a different color that has very few spins.  Vegas Matt tells it like it is while losing.  Valuable player points are only good when you live close to the casino.  I rate this game a Sando.
Nope. Didn't like the game. BORING
Good Ole Herbie Hancock 🤣😂 Best Singer Around lmao  Tommy boy reference for the win!
Let this be a lesson to you guys. Just bc you did good ONE time on some lame game doesn't mean you will EVER again on that stupid game smh. I have to say this is the first time I have had to fast forward through one of your video's when it came to slot play and not table games.
Not gonna lie gentlemen,I had to fast forward through three quarters of this damn boring game.Not a fan.
That sucked! Tomorrow will be better
Let’s never play this game again . —————-> 🚀
Boring game. Why are you playing it?
Out of curiosity Just based on pure speculation do you find the slots to be looser and other states like Arizona for example versus Nevada? Or at the smaller Indian casinos? And if so where or what state in your opinion would you say has the loosest slots at their casinos?
Whats this about a fly by?
w2 is your name jason?
Play something we all like like buffalo or dragon link. I’ll request again mystical mermaid pls and thx!
I can’t believe the fly by reference was crickets. Sorry WBG I woulda had your back on that one.
WHAT AN SANDO SLOTMACHINE. I don't know what was more annoying, EJ and his rhetoric about the fly-bys for the first 35 minutes or how much you guys lost.  Hopefully the Nevada Gaming Commission watches this and makes sure this stupid slot is never in Nevada!
Not every video can be gold, but this is the first clunker in a really long time.  Still love the channel and never miss a video
Does pushing the buttons count as part of your Tai Chi?
They have it a golden nugget
Can you guys please stop saying spit-up so much in the videos? Idk about others but I often watch your uploads when I'm eating dinner and it's just a gross word to constantly hear.   Thanks for all the stuff you do
"LMFAO" are the ones that sing Party "Rockets"...  formerly known as Party Rockin'
I wonder if you dropped your bet a little if you might have better luck. This $37.50 bet ain't paying!
🤣🤣
Rocket Rumble….. more like Rocket Rubbish 😂
LMFAO - party rock anthem
That game is ass
That game is SANDO
More like Rocket Fumble
Stop being cheap with question of the day winners. Leave a heart on winners comments telling them to contact you if they win. You don't watch an entire video one time and you don't know you won. Ridiculous
This episode was a disaster
That was a tough watch.  What a terrible machine
WBG and crew.  What should I spend my question of the day gift card on in the merch store? Favorite items?
They gotta be getting paid to play certain machines. That is the worst slot I've ever seen. After the 1st ticket I was all the way out.. 😂
QOTD: If you got a blank check just make us a Vegas Matt or other person slot machine, what would you make your dream slot machine? Not "pays out every time" lol just what are the most fun bonuses and game mechanics you want to put in your game and what theming?
WBG QOTD - Question of the day: Given the amount of merch you have sold has anyone appeared in a police mug shot wearing any Vegas Matt T-shirts or Merch yet? If not then what do you think the over/under is on that time-wise? I kinda want to see a guy with a black eye after starting a bar fight pictured in a "lets enjoy this!" T-shirt appearing in a Vegas PD mugshot. Many of the phrases on the shirts would take on a whole new meaning in a mug shot, starting with "Sando". Please note that if they are true Vegas Matt fans I want them to be found not guilty after the photo.
The good thing about this session is… I won’t be playing that rocket 🚀 dud of a sando slot machine ever! Thanks for the heads up!
Yeah tht was 35 minutes of "have you lost your minds?" and then I finally saw what made you like it. That was a sweat in itself!
I work for a slot company in Georgia. We make Georgia Skill cabinets (gas station type), and it is hard to get into the Nevada market.
Nice show what's your fav casino to play
This was so bad I almost unsubscribed hit a grand then get wrecked betting 32.50 is a disaster
WBG question of the day- How does everyone feel about Matt’s accidental fast spins during the bonuses?
Thia is just Fan Dual right? WTF is this?
I enjoy watching you guys because you do play higher stakes. I also like how EJ keeps you lot under control, when you start going off track.
Oh my, what a terrrible game. Better luck next time.
That sucks guys. Red Rocket sucks balls.
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes 😂
I don’t know why but the accidental spins in the bonus absolutely makes me lose my shit lol. It just seems like your bonus would be so much better if you didn’t do that….idiot!!!
"Drop it in" at Albertsons.....this "Blows" idiots!!!!
Love that you guys are playing different games, but I hated this one from the jump…”Play on Players”
Boring today.
Disaster
I know why they don’t have this game in Las Vegas
This game is 100% better than ANY huff and puff game! Was more entertaining!
dam fly lol
Question: all this talk about Vegas grandbaby makes me wonder- what baby names did you consider for EJ and Annie?
Fast hitting ugh😮
Been a while since I've fast forwarded a video
Daily watchers here, so I don't mean this in a rude or mean way...but that game was not fun to watch.
Dang that was painful, eventually I skipped to the end and oof that sucked 😂
WBG question of the day After hearing you guys talk about the availability of games in certain states you guys being associated with FanDuel makes me wonder if you’d have any idea when or if the game Pirates that you guys play will be coming to Pennsylvania I live in Pennsylvania and I would really enjoy playing this game I believe however I can’t get it on my phone or computer Just wondering if you had any pool or if there’s anything we can do in Pennsylvania to try to get this problem straightened out?
Over or under 176 - How many times did they say "fly by" in that video?
Probably one of the worst videos in a long time.
I could smell the SANDO from here……
Question for Adam: if you could change one gambling law/regulation, what would it be?
Not a very good video. The bottom of the machine was cut off. Could not see bets or wins or balance.
I think you are joking around
Sandaster of a game!😢
Wow. Pure trash.
This game is awful. Ugh
Don't understand your affinity for this game, pretty boring stingy bonuses.
Do any of you guys ever get bored of gambling. I think if I gambled everyday it would get less exciting
Please never play this game again.
QOTD....As a female, I would love to have Vegas Mom day each week. Do you think she would be 'game' to be among you guys for one day a week?
Played at Mt airy hit the free feature on a $3 bet on buffalo and got the 200x ball   Your right your never out of it !! 🎉
What a bad game…
Ugh, whoever convinced you guys to chase purple 28 is nuts! I could’ve understood 30, definitely 31 starting point but you guys are playing at a pretty extreme house edge on $37.50. Glad you hit the grand to allow for this crazy play!
You idiots are killing me with the damn fast spins.
Horrible game
Party rocking is made by LMFAO
What a san-dastic ending 😂
Question of the day:  What book would you all recommend to read for an aspiring entrepreneur?
Awful game, would’ve switched after the first bonus.
Jump off the rocket 🚀
Buffalo!!!!
In the words of WBG, "This game is A**!" Can I get my 90 minutes back?
Question of the day.......Have you ever gambled in Deadwood, SD
Love your videos this one a SANDOoo thankfully there is fast forward
QOTD for EJ, if Hollywood decided to make a movie about you guys who do you think would be a good actor to portray each member of the Vegas Matt gang?
You guys are crazy… very boring for your viewers
You Ever see the Aristocrat Game...original version in Nevada??? Only Colorado that I know......liability on it is Huge!!
Will be in Sedona in two weeks on a sisters trip. I have 6 sisters. All they want to do is hike and go to wineries. I like whiskey and beer. I hate wine. My knees won’t let me hike. I hate hiking. I just want to go to Cliff Castle Casino, but I won’t be able to. 😩 Not looking forward to this trip in all honesty! Ok, got it out. Love you guys!
Probably the worst episode in a long time
VM states that bonus was awful….No, the whole game was awful.  Avoid that lads 😮
This was like watching paint dry🤣
That game is very boring to watch. Not engaging at all as a viewer
I don't want credit, I prefer cash! Classic wbg!😅
You must get some casino revenue for playing that stupid game.
Man,  That was like getting kicked in the nuts on repeat  I’d rather see you guys win.
I always love when you guys get on a saying and run with it for 20 videos. "Never out of it in this game!"
If you don't remember... its your viewer that keeps the money flowing..💰 🤑 💸 💲
Worst game ever😩
That game sucks
First sando, now disaster,  next saying should be brutal!
What's wbgs favorite spot game
Not even entertaining.Had to skip to see where else you landed.1 hour 30 mins on the worst game .ps Luv the channel 99.99%of the time😂
hate fast spins very hard to watch. 1 to 3 ok but always i will switch off
What a waste of 3 seconds...VM you need to up your game.....
Uffda, chiming in that fast spins are not fun to watch at all.
I must say I love my money clip, used it today and hit a jackpot 🎉🎉
So VM wants another game in Vegas to lose on. Got it
Jeezus, you have no clue how to do a proper fast spin even after all this time... unreal.
As much as I love watching you all, this game bores me to tears!😢
Black eye peas song Vegas Matt 😂🎉
Vegas Matt has been sounding jaded lately - and I don't blame him....  it sounds like tough going out there.
I just started watching who has the red rockets on the side bet.
The game appears to be fun, it was the fast spins, even when waiting for the hand pay.
How these guys so bad at pop culture?? Lmfao 🤣🤣🤣
Can you cut the time below an hour ,  please??
Fast forward to the end
Love you sessions but this one was terrible! Don't play that again!
Potowatomi has fly bys! 😂
You should have known and quit that game long before you lost that much money!!
😂😂😂😂 I’m so dead at his non chalant questions!  Who sings that? OutKast! Lmfao!!! I’m dead!!! 😂😂😂😂😂  Great video Vegas Matt
DEFINITELY OVER BETTING ROCKET RUMBLE
This game is so stupid. Wastes a spin to give you a free spin which is then a waste of a spin.
Horrible game!!
Very very bad game please don’t play anymore
This game suckZzzz
Did you go to Don Shula's steak house?
Disaster!
Most people are happy when they win a bonus and get a taxable jackpot.
That’s game sucks.
Fly by my ass
"Party Rock is in the house tonight....everybody just have a good time.... and we gone make you lose your mind..... we just wanna make you.....shake that....every day I'm shufflin...." It's "LMFAO" Vegasmatt. That's who sings it.
I never say anything negative because I religiously watch you ever day but this was the most boring video/game ever.  Sorry 😢
WBG My questions  to all of you is,  do ya'll even come to Texas? We only have 2 casinos here but trust me we'd love to see ya'll play here.  Preferably at Naskila Casino.
Personally i dont like the lucky fast spin. there isnt anything lucky about it but if looking like an ameture is your thing then long live the lucky fast spin
Question of the day what is Vegas Matt’s favorite breakfast??
One of the most painful videos I’ve ever watched. Learn to walk away and switch machines
This rocket game is a sando
I don't understand why and how this game is good?!? It looks and pays like trash 😅
Torture 😂😂😂 ❤❤❤
No idea why you play these non winning games .Down the toilet .
This machine was a disaster
WBG QOTD: What is everyone's idea of a perfect day and why?
Not a fan of that game at all. I’m guessing out of 200 bonus spins, 180 we complete duds
i always wonder where does the initial money you put in come from? videos? vegas matt? or do you all put up some money each video?
ANOTHER video title that sounds like a crappy porno 🤣🤣
Slot machines used to be one-armed bandits. Now they are one-button bandits.
Hey guys, dunno what’s going on, but I’ve be a religious watcher for a few years, first thing I watch each day (Australia), when I get up in the morning and open YouTube it’s always the top video, the last two days it hasn’t been on my feed at all and I have to go to your channel to watch it, weird.
QOTD??  Would you rather have good line pays on the way to get a bonus? Or just keep spinning to get the bonus? For example last night I was playing a game at 1.76 a spin and hit a 280.00 line pay but it took awhile to get a bonus.
😱 wow! I kept expecting it to happen. Those bonuses were not good.😢
WBG QOTD: All of you come from different parts of the states. Have any of you looked into your ancestory, lineage to see if any interesting realitives have came through your family trees or any roots in other countries etc .
I think you over bet that machine
Absolutely trash game! Im glad I watched this, so i never put my own money in that game
Too long on one game 🤷‍♂️
knew at the start of the video as soon as you says counter chasing.....you were fucked!!!! i do blame EJ
My goodness!  I was cooking and had you guys on my monitor.  I lost count how many times you guys complained about the bonuses.  I agree with others.  What's this chasing these counters?  I was hoping in the 1:23 min video, you would have switched games.  Better luck next time.  But, you make your own luck when you stay on a losing machine.
I love W2’s common sense words of wisdom: “Generally you want to hit the best things as much as possible.” 😂👍
This game sucks just like the most of them . Casino is for entertainment only , but very expensive entertainment 😉
Sorry guys, WORLDS MOST DULL AND UNEVENTFUL GAME!
Ping   Freedom
I just figured out what this game reminds me exactly of.   This is like the long version of buy a bonus in any game.   Instead of paying for a bonus right away, in this game you just fast spinned ur way into buying a bonus.
I can obviously only speak for myself but I find these types of games, especially this one, not nearly as entertaining to watch as games with a higher volume of bonuses. Absolute disaster viewing wise
🎉🎉🎉🎉
That was really disappointing for all. Even us ! I don't think I will be playing this game if it shows up near me ! Lol
Ow,ouch, sorry! That didn’t quite work out….😢😢😢
EJ, ya have 1 job to control the camera and you literally never could see the balance.  So bad!! Do better bro
not a game I'd play - YUCK
Is that the world's first casino inside a giant subwoofer?
Where in Arizona
This was probably the first ever I wanted and thought about turning it off multiple times but I stuck it out with u guys because I like you guys.
That was a little waste of life watching that slot session. Dull as ditchwater.
You all sitting on the same Machine after getting wrecked and never changing bets or moving machines really gives Mr Handpay’s theory of people using casino money more fuel cause no one would do this
Well I’m glad you played that game because it shows that I’ll never want to play this game if I go to a casino
We've watched all of your posts.  Absolutely this was the worst!!
The term, "idiots", comes to mind.
Question of the day: What is some of your favourite accents???
Not a fan of the one slot machine videos
good luck
Gonna admit, not a big fan of that game. Not sure if I’m alone on that or not
Why don't you play the same machine  next to you just put  some money in it to see if that's a winner. That machine might be better. Good Luck!!😊
flat out painful episode to watch, lets retire this POS game for good please.
As a poor person, I can’t relate to being annoyed at getting a hand pay. 😂😂
Great game🙄 I do applaud the effort 🎉
This game is a disaster I would have left it. Enjoy the videos
Sure wish EJ liked Dragon Link - these stupid games are sooo boring!
No Dragon Link in Washington, no Truple Fortune Dragon in Nevada.
Based on comments you all should really start listening to the fans and what they like cause it’s not this
1hr and 25 mins and we still have no clue what graffiti guy is
The definition of sand ending. That machine was a big letdown. I thought for sure it was gonna be a big come back.
This game sucked and the days you all chase counters are sooooo boring
Why would you flush your cash with unnecessary fast spins that aren’t working
The utter lack of flyby's was disappointing.
First game sucked. Only thing that made it worst was eJ yelling like Lenny from of mice and men. fLy By
29:50 the fast spins on a game like that are appreciated. The only goal is to collect the symbols so why not try and do it as fast as possible
1:17 I got the joke if no one else did😭because they are called LMFAO aka a funny name 😂
We need a retake tonight! 😊Buffalo
Play rising rockets guaranteed to win big
LMFAO I think did that song
Nothing like regal riches. Love watching regal riches. This not so much.
This game is endorsed by the National Anethesiologists Program (NAP)
Change it up Homeboyz- you may like it- no one else does.
Sorry, but that game sucked
All those fast spins in the bonuses was really annoying .
worst game ive ever seen
Love you guys but please don’t lay that again on a daily basis
My dogs fav symbol is the reds rocket.
Watching & sipping my Friday after work coffee out of my "Let's Enjoy This" VM mug. I love this thing! My new favorite mug.
I  once not long ago liked watching Vegas Matt and friends but for some reason the fun of watching ( for me) anyway the joy has gone, i cant say whats changed but i feel like i really know
This game sucks!  Sorry guys.  I would say your trip to AZ was not worth it.
Worst game to watch very boring and the bonuses are not great either
A wise man once said “this game is ass”
Hey Vegas Matt! Quit pushing the god damned button in the bonus!!
Rocket game is BANNED 🚫
Can I please have my 1.5 hours of life back? That was awful
I'm out at 35 minutes, God awful!!
The reason why this game is not in Vegas is because they decided they didn’t want to make it that obvious that they are ripping slot players off. I mean huff and puff is obvious enough.   This game would just leave no doubt.
Hate the quick spins....
Boring
Worst case scenario. Chased bonus that results in a dud!  Better luck next time!
Your video is now flagged by the national band of anesthesiology. You’ve been warned
This game is terrible very boring episode just skipped to end halfway through.
QOD: you guys were guessing about why a game would be in one state but not another but I’d love to know if Adam knows
I  wrote about 50 questions and never got an answer. So I quit asking questions.😂😂😂😂😂
I like AZ EJ he was surprisingly positive.. 😅 Oh ! And QOTD: For Vegas Matt. Do you want to be my dad 👨‍👩‍👧 🥹
I just hate slots that cock tease. You had many chances to get that red and you already know you aren’t getting it. Just dumb wishing on a dream
Hi guys,  Here's an old profit boosting casino trick for gambling friends who have nervous hand syndrome. Just before the bonus starts, put a clean, empty, inverted ashtray over the spin button.  Guaranteed to eliminate those pesky quick spins during the bonuses. 😂
LMFAO is who sings that lol
Question of the day. Have any of you ever attended the Kentucky Derby? If so, what did you think? If not, would you ever consider going?
So this game is for suckers
I hope you got live tonight and give it a shot on another machine next to it. Love you gentleman and am always looking forward to the next one.
At 40:30 a fly flew onto the slot machine’s top left corner. I took off my flip flop and hit my TV screen lol…then W2 is yelling “FLY by” at the start of the bonus hahaaa
Blueberry has been around a long time . I never play them because they are bingo games. It's a different gaming class. They are always found in rasinos
wow, 1.5 hours
This game absolutely SUCKS! I have played it a few times, and it was garbage every time. This was no exception! You guys kept talking about a fly by being the best part of the game, yet it seems to very rarely ever happen. When it did happen it wasn't even good smh. That being said, what is the point in playing this stupid game when the "best part" about the game happens as often as a rainbow moon and sucks when it does happen. This game shouldn't be in any casino.
What's the RTP in arizona
Worst game ever
Nevada would never ever blow that game
A little late today, but wouldn’t ever miss you on purpose Vegas Matt!!!
Love the fast spins
This game stinks!!!!
😢 most likely the worst episode I’ve ever seen. It’s like the four of you were totally entranced in that machine with fast spins and to be honest first time ever I was bored. Long time watching, laughed and enjoyed. Very disappointed in this episode.
Seriously?I've asked this fifty times but do you remember the days when you got a bonus and you actually won money?
Sorry,  you deserve to lose this time. This game sucks big time😂😂😂
QOTD(might be better for the casino manager): When you hit a jackpot, and it is a five, six, or even a seven figure jackpot. Can or will the casino write you a check for the amount? Or do they have to give it to you in cash? Always curious because for me it would be nerve wracking to walk around with that kind of money. Thank you!!
Love you guys..did not like that game...put me to sleep...
Sorry to see y'all have a bad day. Tomorrow will be better, no doubt. Good job keeping a good attitude Ej you kept everybody in there today.
Fast Spins or Slow spins don’t change the outcome of any slot as there is NO WAY to time the RNG with a push of the button that sends an electronic signal to the RNG which has 100k combinations per second.  Lucky timing is the key.
QOTD - it’s seem like you all are really superstitious. Do the superstitious tendencies cross over into regular life or are they just around gambling? Any “ocd” type things?
WBG Question.... You all the best.  Had the pleasure meeting you in Valley Forge and you were so genuine and gracious.  My question is:  When I put my players card in Golden Gong.  It stated checking to see if player is eligible for progressive.   Is that normal?   Do you have to be at a certain level to qualify for progressives?
Question of the day. Will Vegas Matt ever make a movie based off his book? Or his life?
Have you guys ever gotten the special feature where the bluberi comes out ? Very epic
24:15 quote of the day. VM gets a purple rocket and says "Hey, we got one. Hope they start coming FAST now." Response from WBG, "Some people don't like that when that happens." (Nobody commented) lol!
Not quite sold on this one save my airfair for vegas
“Its an industry term” 😂 W2 …. I haven’t heard that since My Cousin Vinny❤
Question of day
Glad that rocket game isn't in my state lmao. Did you ever get a flyby
WBG question of the day for casino manager Adam why dont they put wager saver on all games or is it just some manufacturers that offer it ?
Jesus, I rather watch the Huff & We’ve Had Enuff slot 🤣
85 mins of the same crap game, not ur finest video
what's with sitting on that machine the whole time
I used to say negative ghost rider pattern is full to my son throughout his childhood . We were watching top gun and Maverick requested a flyby. I said the line and looked at my son as he looked at me and he finally got why I had been saying that for years and it was priceless.
A question. Matt wants a private jet.  Have any of you guys ever piloted a plane? Even if just taking over the controls for a min.
Please don’t ever subject us to that yawn of a session and game again 😅
That game is a disaster!😅
Now Get the Red Tomorrow 🎰 👍 !! 😂
Let's just say we won't do this again
While watching on TV this video was torture. The only think amusing was at the 40:31 part of video when a fly landed on the upper left part of the slot reel. My wife thinking the fly was in our house jumped up with fly swatter in hand and was ready to swat the TV . I yelled "don't hit the TV, the fly is in the video" Still laugh about it as I watch her rub the TV to make sure.
You guys are a disater.. you dont have much compassion or consideration for your audience  . Matt's fast spinning is just rude to people watching... we can't even see how much a win is.. at least when there is a fairly good line hit ..let us see how much. Matt doesn't even know what's going on.
W2 with the joke that no one caught about the party rock song…. “They have a funny name” ❤
This might be the most boring video I’ve watched in quite some time
How many times did EJ say fly-by? 😑
Fire it in there enjoy watching
W2 Jesus, I think you mean the BBRRS (Big Beautiful Red Rocket Spin) haha
This game sucks
going to be honest here. i fast forward through the video. it was pretty boring from the little i watched.
I always watch your videos straight through beginning at 2:45. Today I paused about 6 times to do something else. Not a good sign for the game. 💖 Still here, see you tomorrow. 👍
Answer of the day is that vegas matt eg and wbg and wbg i just wanted to say that I watch every day and you all are awesome the best and keep firing in there vegas matt how amazing was getting the grand and what is the best advice when chosen the best slot where you don't get wrecked keep on firing it in there
Possible Question of the Day?  I have been enjoying your videos since the early days of your channel. I am the same age as Matt and have been visiting Las Vegas several times a year for the last 27 years, therefore witnessing the city go through many changes. My question is…Is there anything you miss about the Las Vegas of the past?
This game is just as trash as Regal Riches. The average gambler can't win. You need around 300x in ammo or more just to try to win. It's dumb and boring to watch
I LOVED IT !!!!!!
I love all the hate for this game from the ploppies here. This game is a legitimate advantage play game, and can be beaten long term.
The big companies don’t want the competition in Nevada
Please keep that game far away from the other 49 states please
With all those fast spins and crap game.......being honest, I couldn't watch this one. Sorry, guys. 😢
*knock off brand of regal riches!  That was the most boring machine, bonuses were all duds, didn’t even like the aesthetic of the machine. Thank you for showing us what NOT to play. Back to hunting buffalo please
As wbg would say,"What a great bonus!"😂
Did someone cast a vote and yall all decided to start playing one game for the Whole video now . Last couple videos have been snoozers
It was nice meeting you guys at the airport today. I’m a huge fan of
Long time listener here.... please dont ever play this game again. It was so painful to watch. Every spin was all 4 promising us something great 😂😂😂 im worn out mentally.. i need a nap or cigarette. (I dont smoke 😅)
Definitely not OutKast…LOL
Halfway thru,I'm off to Walmart shoplifting videos,more exciting😂
Imagine if you never had to work for anything and just got everything handed to you. That’s exactly the emptiness you will radiate then old mate here does. Work gives us a bigger purpose and a lifetime of not really having done any will leave one empty beyond repair.
Terrible game
You guys should stick to buffalo link, dragon link, ultimate x, and occasionally huff ‘n’ puff. Any game that looks like this is a disaster.
No interest in these “live” formats
Fast tapping is horrible , hate it.🤬
What happened to "Fire it in there Friday"?    $37.50 a spin?  on a ridiculous slot you chased. Im finding myself fast forwarding on these videos.
Parry rock is lmfao!
The dedication to losing is impressive!
53 minutes into this video and I'm wondering why wbg didn't warn the team that this game is ass! I think 7 of 8 bonus's not a hand pay and it's the only game I've ever heard ej recommend fast spins, sure hope it improves.
Can't win them all, that's an absolute wreck of a day. Good luck in the next one!
Sorry not your best!!
I feel so bad for you guys! That was awful!
I just smacked a 400x off the purle rockets, great game
Very boring game guys please don’t play this anymore
Yeah hopefully this is the last time seeing this game. I had to skip to the end because after the first 10 min it was terrible. An hour and a half of wolf peak would be much better
Booooooorrrrrriiiinnnngggggg
Vegas Matt, if you are willing to risk and potentially lose 10 to 15 thousand a day gambling on slots, Why not bet more for a potentially higher payout if you win? Just food for thought 🤔🍲
When did you each realize that you would branch out on your own ventures and not work for anyone else and did you ever regret it?
that bass on this game is terrible, almost blew up my speakers
That was painful to watch. What a Sando!!!!!! Better luck tomorrow, gentlemen. 🤝
this is very boring game !!!
Hate the constant fast spins.. occasionally is ok, but NEVER NEVER during the bonus.
Knowing matt there is no way he ended up staying till the bud vs canelo fight was over huh? Didn't start till 1 here in Omaha lol
Fly by this!
I can't believe they don't even give you one bet on the trigger.
🗣🗣FLY BY 😂😂😂😂😂
Throw the machine into the dry hole. I've come to  the conclusion that VM doesn't want to entertain the idea of shaman helping EJ reverse the curse. Desperate times need desperate measures, if only Patric Swayze was still with us so he round house the curse.
I thought even you guys used to always say don't chase the counter. What happened
That wasn't worth all the dang adds every 4 minutes idiots....
I thought even you guys used to always say don't chase the counter. What happened
This game was horrible its right up there with huff n puff
Confusing game!😊
WBG’s brain goes to something stupid not clever
That game scorched you. Horribly boring to boot.
You guys are the biggest suckers for must hit by. If only wolk peak had one.
One thing we learned from today. Never expect the fly by
Game really sucks you guys aren’t playing some really crummy games lately they’re not interested to watch
That game stinks. Not impressed 😢 sorry guys
QUESTION of the day.  Do you ever wake up in the morning and think “I really don’t want to gamble today”.  Does it feel like a regular 9-5 job at times that you sometimes are fed up at?
This game is ass.
This game is a “BLAST”! See what I did there?
Matt: “maybe they will come (cum) faster” W2: “some people don’t like that” 😂😂😂
Question of the day: If every casino had to comp just one meal/dish, what would y’all want it to be.   A lot of people are saying it should be a steak dinner (sorry WBG)
When I saw Blasting Off… my mind immediately went to Vegas Grampa does DMT 😂
Disaster
Wow  wasted an hour to see you actually lose 12500
No wonder you guys are down a half a million dollars on the year. You waste your money on games like this.  Ps... EJ is still a girl
Great game..... not
Not a fun video
Can't wait until you play that game again....a.lot of people sayin' it...(not)
Man, Raja hooked EJ and WBG up!!
😢
I blame Ej😂
I want to win the iphone!!! I know you hate androids so I need to upgrade.
Omg fire 13gs into Dragon Link! You'd be up 50gs! Yikes...no more sando games!  W2❤
Question of the day:  when you open your own casino, what are your 5 picks for slots you are guaranteed to have.
I avoid bluberi machines like the plague. All their games have garbage line hits and garbage bonuses.
20+ years I was a 602 girl.
I can’t understand just pissing your money away when a machine is giving you squat.
Thought W2 was saying a great dad joke when they couldn’t remember who some Party Rock Anthem (it’s LMFAO) .. W2 “they have a funny name”
In WBG voice “This Game Is A$$”🤣🤣
Mmmm bad slot game guys… stick to buffalos or the Yeti or dragon links or bull blitz..  keep up the great content though 👍🏻
Dozens of rockets but credit for two. Bullshit.
Most over hyped game this team loves to talk about
I have been a faithful supporter for years watching every single day and I guess today is the last day. The fast spins are such a turn off. It’s not fun to watch
WBG Question of the Day: If you had to choose only 1 City and Casino to gamble at other than Vegas where would you go? I’d like to hear everyone’s answer please. Thank you! Love the videos! I watch you guys everyday on my way to work!
“Some people don’t like that” W2 😂
You guys are Insane
Matt needs to get drunk, cuss like a sailor, and strike the boy for speaking without being spoken to
Worst game ever😂😂😂 please don't play this again😢😢😢
Guys I watched you from day 1. This was the most boring video EVER. That game makes me want to never gamble again. I actually rather eat glass then play that sando game. PLAY SOME BLACK JACK.
Question of the day I think it is very clear why biggest Matt has been successful in his life and it’s the fact that he gets up and does it again tomorrow. I know that he loves gambling and all of that but the last few months have been pretty rough and even before the grand everyone was thinking well maybe they’ll take a break but they didn’t and even after today’s interesting session with the rocket rumble he said they’ll be back again tomorrow that perseverance and that get up and do it again is a huge factor in most people success.   Sorry for the preamble: here’s the question, what are other examples in your life Vegas mat or any of the crew where perseverance really paid off not gambling related necessarily, but trying something that’s difficult and getting bad results but in the end it worked out. I think a lot of us would be interested in hearing some of those stories because times can get tough and inspiration is always important.
Over an hour of Rocket Rumble… 🥱 glad you finally got off!  Stretch!  Enjoy your wkend fellas
I get nervous when the video is over 50 minutes. It means something happened
Lame
Love the Tommy Boy refence ! At what point do you guys think enough is enough when you have a losing day? do you just stop and go do something else? Or do you keep grinding to try and win it back?
This was the one machine I would walk away from and not play ever again!! It was boring and had no wins that i would consider worth while!!
that gave me hot snakes
WBG.  You talk too much.  Please shut up
What a complete waste of my time. Terrible. I was so hyped! Bummer.
‘Party rockers in the house tonight’.. who sings that.. they have a funny name I don’t remember 😂😂😂 I’m not even going to say it. Please like this comment when you realise 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Not anybodies fault but that game didn't justify a long video. It just wasn't interesting enough as a viewer. Also it definitely sucked the life out the guys
They made the must hit by counters just for you suckers 😂
Wbg question of the day Since matt loves animal kingdom  Did he catch reference to Guam  What does he know about Guam  Marianas Trench And does he know Saipan has a dormant casino he could buy and how could he use property  To buy his jet
BORING
Finally a long video, of most boring game ever.
back to Vegas and into El Cortez
You’re insane!! 😂
Maybe a fun game for you but a boring boring game for the fans
So just out of curiosity, no shade here at all would you guys consider yourself degenerate gamblers or do you think you could just quit gambling at any time?
Thank You for showing me to NEVER PLAY THIS GAME!!!! - I appreciate it  =)
Question of the day for WBG to read. I play buffalo stampede at 10 cent denom. my bet choices are $8, $20, $30 and $50. Do you think there is a players advantage to any of these bet amounts or does it not make any difference?
That was a fun game 🍀🇮🇪
that was crap
They are showing you what not to do after winning over 200k.  Don't give it back.   They can because they do this for our entertainment.  To the budget gamblers If you ever win that much or more,  that should be the last time your ever at the casino😊.
Well dang!!!!
That game is built for fast spinning!
whats the largest case of someone essentially throwing away money and still hitting it bigtime that yall have personally seen? like someone playing blackjack against the book and going on a huge streak or someone whos only guessing and constantly switching sides on baccarat, or just in anyway you think would normally be a waste? very interested to hear any stories yall have like that! love what you all do!
Rocket Rumble. What a stitch up of a game.
16k 😂 in game with 37$ bet 😮  small bet for get money back, unbelievable
This game went much better on the live streams
Not a fan of the rocket rumble.
You guys should buy a whole bunch of scratchers while you’re in Arizona and see if you win
I think this is a very stupid game!!°
WBG question of the day. Which of you is willing to get your groove on. Watching the start of Dancing With the Stars season, I wondered if any of you would ever consider competing on this show. I think each one of you has potential.
40:29 Did anyone notice the fly-by on the upper left reel?  Haha!
What's the point of the game sweating the third rocket boost spin icon, when if you do get that bonus it shows up immediately?  It makes no sense.
I’m happy they don’t have this slot machine in Vegas because sometimes you just know 😊
QOTD to casino manager:  I see bulk of the hand pay jackpots to be sub $2000.  When the jackpot limit goes up to $2000 in 2026, do you think machine manufacturer  and/or casinos will make changes to the machines to reflect the new limit?
Now I know what game not to play. 😊
What the hell was that question of the day. Is WBG on the spectrum?
Honest question...when they say "Row" in these videos...are they talking about columns?  Are many people saying this?
Bad bad game !!!!!??
EJ tried to be positive but this session gradually drained him of hope.
That's a purple nurple!
Hope you guys can read my question in Spanish!
Hate to say that game put me to sleep
This game didn't last long at Gun Lake.  People hardly played it.
Can't believe how long you guys stay on a loosing machine 😮
Hola tengo está pregunta  Cada vez que juegan sienten la emoción o ya Es parte de su vida diaria?
Who is Herbie Hancock ?
Drinking game, take a shot every time you hear "fly by"
...........
It’s LMFAO
Good to stop chasing 👍
VM this game is straight AZzzzzz game sucks your money and is rather Boring I blame this on EJ for encouraging it 🫠
EJ is correct, but insane is an understatement…lol…J/K… Love you guys 😊
QOTD as my kids are back in school and they are signing up/joining  school activities.   My question for you all, when you were in school did you guys ever join any sports teams or school clubs and if so which ones.  As well which was your favorite?  Love your channel and thank you for the daily laughs 😁
What an unlucky session guys, better luck next time. Thank you for all the videos and staying as positive as you can get while losing so much. Enjoy the content, love watching you
I would much rather watch Buffalo Gold Collection!!!
Day 358 of commenting every day until Vegas Matt and crew come to Mystic Lake Casino Hotel in Minnesota 🎉❤🎉
That was the most passive aggressive comment I've ever heard 😂 30:15
A.T. Alien I think
Rocket Rumble - 👎👎👎👎 Vegas Matt and friends - ❤❤❤❤
Lmfao are the ones that sing that song
Sorry guys but that was the most boring video of a slot machine don't  bother playing this again in my opinion...
He said OutKast... im dead
Gila River ARIZONA is Garbage like I said on Yesterday's post....lol 😂. Talking Stick has $200,000 Buffalo Link GRAND
QOTD for CMA (GMA): 10 or more years ago "Community Bonus" slots were really big and everywhere. Why dont you see them very often anymore?
I cant believe you guys used the whole video of 90 minutes for that shitty boring game. I was so happy when i saw the video is 90 minutes buf now im so dissapointed. First time ever im disliking a video of this channel
What is your favorite city to play in and why?
F this game
Watching that slot is torture- thats why i didnt watch it. No one i know likes  thats slot but you.
Unlike Buffalo, you are out of that game when you put cash in the machine! What a disaster and so boring!
Question of the day, would you rather win $10,000 over a session but not have "fun" bonusses, or $7,500 but have the bonuses be fun to play?
That.\n's what you get for playing such a stupid game
qotd >>>>>>>>>  as opposed to wasting all those Rocky chances why don't you cash those every time you get there save them up and put them in for a Baccarat double or nothing get even better when you're done gambling on the slot machine and see how that works out
I noticed the difference between this video and the one in Wisconsin was that you didn't have Vegas Mom sitting with you playing the machine beside you. I think she was the lucky charm that night.
The dragon you keep hearing scream in the background is what you should play. Dragons law fortune bags.
Imagine someone walking by me when W2 says,  "I want to see 1 of those balls spit out another purple mouse!" 😂😅
What  a shame  mega Matt used  casino money and fool people  it's all fake money 😮😮😅
Does anyone know why Dracula has disappeared?
So wy pkau an hour on it that all your fault bad dedcision
This game is dreadful Not fun to watch Can see how you guys lose so much
10,000 of nothing😢
that game was a disaster! I disagree completely about that being  a fun game. Very boring and you got nothing.
Awful Game.   Glad you showed me what Game to never play should it show up at the Tribal Casinos I play at in N Mi.
I love you guys watch you guys every day. First thing I do when I get off work don’t ever play that again again.
which Gila River Casino are you at?
Why must you torture us! Play keno for once in your life, four card, four of you pick numbers and make a big bet of 10.00 each card, what could the outcome be come be? This game you played more than disturbing! Still love ya!
Gents, maybe next time switch to the machine next to you and see if that one is hotter or gives the bonus feature you are looking for.  And if that one is a sando then move back and see if maybe it was a timing thing.  I don't know. I always lose, so maybe not great advice, haha😂 just a thought 😀
WBG, yes, they are Chinese zodiac symbols.  There are 12, with mouse/rat being first, and pig/boar being last.  Personally I’m a pig (1959…but it changes on the lunar new year and not the calendar new year).
Fast spins give me a headache. Not a fan of this new game.
Wow whole video playing that 🗑️ must have been ejs idea
SANDO!!!!!! IDK what a fly by is, because it never happened lol. thanks for the entertainment boys!!
Someone told me WBG is a kissless virgin. He sure does act like it. What a dweeb
Fast spins 💥
The fast bins are excellent because the game is boring 😞
disaster
Nothing better than going into my weekend watching these grifters piss away more money.
For liking games that seem random, I think that was the least random game I've ever seen.
Idiots, you can see during rapid games that each machine is a mini business owned by people like Matt ($45 Million) worth and its all income expenditure calibrated so you can talk as much and wish as much as you'd like the odd 212.000 is a rarity and Matt is not even up to speed on wins ( what happened, how much was that, what's happening? ) Take a great win and quit.
I'm not a fan of Blueberry games. It takes too long to get the bonus and when you finally one its a sando.
I had stop watching that game give me a headache
You guys should have flown by that game
Question...Do you ever while filming have issues with people around you getting upset with how excited ya'll get? Big fan love from SC!
Never ever play this stupid game I refuse to watch! 🤮
Question of the day: If the Vegas Matt Casino ever opened which position would each of you work in?
What about the game next to your side could be better
(Day 343 of asking) WBG's Question of the day: If you were limited to only playing slots from one slot company for the rest of your life, (i.e., Aristocrat, Konami, IGT, Bluberi, etc.) which one would you choose and why?  Everyone can answer this one! ^w^
If you don't like waiting for hand pays you should play with me!
Sometimes the journey is better than the destination.
What us thus "Flyby" you speak of??
Please don’t punish us again with this game again
My favorite you tube channel love you guys but not that game :(
The WORST
WBG I’d like to know more about the equipment you guys use, camera, mics, editing software, etc
this slot is absolute gash
WBG Question of the day:: WBG - when and why did you decide to become vegan? W2Jesus - when and why did you decide to stop drinking alcohol?
Game is garbage. Incredibly boring to watch.
Sorry guys, I had to fast forward thru majority of time today, that Rocket game was just awful, it was too painful to watch on such a not fun game.
This game was like you guys trying to convince me that wet water is dry😂😂😂😂
That slot was the worst, thanks for showing it I will never play it.
game is ass
Hope you get something. I've never had luck with this game.
QOTD for  Casino Manager Adam. There seem to be a lot of Buffalo based games in Vegas. My local casinos in WA have a ton of Dragon based games. Do manufacturers offer casinos all the themes and you pick what you want - or are themes offered regionally (so we end up with more Dragons and Vegas ends up with more Buffalo)?
Spending 10000 or more to get 1500.00
What a complete Sando game, I would have left that after the first spin!
LMFAO sings that song!!!
Lmfao is their group name 😊
Well…what can you say?! Next time guys!!
Thank you for playing these games so I don't have to. I think that is the tightest, meanest machine I've seen in months on this channel.
Not even close to the last time you played that slot 🫤
Hi Matt, were you the soberest of the four?
Wow that game suckssss
I fell asleep to rocket rumble today waiting for my kid to get out of school 😂. Heading to WinStar for the weekend to fire it in there .  Keep killing it my dudes . Also I will walk right by rocket rumble to play dragon links 😂
"W2 saves the day" Some people don't like that"😂😅
WBG   with all the videos and the streaming till the wee hours of the night , how much sleep do you guys get and how much do you need..     Vegas Matt is the glue that holds the entire experience together ...   Best reality show anywhere.
This game's a SANDONISTA!😂
So many adds today.  😢
Question for EJ: You spend alot of time in casinos.  Do you manage to date? And if so. Do you prefer a woman that gambles or doesnt gamble?
Come to Oklahoma. I won a Grand on $1.25. I sent you an email. 😊
idk why yall stayed on there the whole hour n a half bro WHAT😭
Fly-by.....fly-by....
Have to say I am not caring for the rocket machine,kind of boring
Keep putting up this kind of games you will be celebrating losing a million subscribers. Rather watch you play table games with some big bets . Probably  win more !
LOL...I love that they EXPECT, they ALWAYS EXPECT for the slot machine to be an ATM. It is honestly one of the things that makes them so fun to watch. For people that gamble for a living they seem to not understand that the slot machines are doing exactly what they were made to do.   I am thinking their combined net worth is close to or over 100 million. People like them have no concept of what 1000 bucks is to an average person, which fyi, is one more thing that makes them fun to watch.
Worst video yet i watch everyday and this sucked.
😂 all these people commenting about how crappy that machine was obviously they don't play Slots you generally lose when you play Slots that's the way it works it really doesn't matter what machine you're on it's there to take your money the only machine in the  casino guaranteed to give you money is an ATM
$13k.... the best bonus with the worst outcome. It's shocking how much you can lose gambling.
Today’s QOTD was kind of lame.
What a complete sando😬
I think the rocket 🚀 has expired 💥 turn up the party rock because this game is pure sando believe me bro
Wasted 85 minutes of my life on today’s content.
WBG I’m a little disappointed in you. For a game with Blue pigs on rockets not once did you mention a full screen of them 😂😂😂
Not sure why you like this game…… it’s a joke
Rocket Rumble? More like Rectum Raider
I was right, sando I thought it was a boring game. Fast forward to the ending cause I knew y'all were going to lose.
Bored watching this
The "they have a funny name" about LMFAO (Party Rockin') was great!
Who picked this game
I got a Purple betting 1.50 that paid 2100, so yeah you did horrible.
You are insane, EJ! VM,"They may be right " 😂
Yeah, not playing that one....ever.
Brutal game stick to Dragon 🐉 Link or Buffalo’s ❤
Hey guys! Love watching you every day! Question…. What is each of your all time top memorable win? Together or individually?
Not sure if it was the sound or fast spins giving me a Total Migraine.  Bummer.  Not a Fan.   I would have given up over an hour ago on this machine.    You only need 1 good Spin
WBG question of the day:  Are certain games actually/ mathmatically more volatile then others, or is it just a feel? Also, what is the preference when choosing a slot to play:  more line pays not as good/ frequent bonuses, less line pays great bonuses but harder to get?
Sando
LMFAO is who sings Party Rocking lol one hit wonder. Every day im shuffling.
Heard your 10,000 minor screaming through Mr. vs Mrs. Slots video. Must be a small space your playing in.
Fly by? Fly by? You should have flown right by Arizona
Have to be honest. I didn't think there was a game I could like LESS than buffalo and Huff and Puff. This is it. Sorry it's awful.
Vegas Matt knows who Outkast is! Lol. Good for you Vegas Matt
This game sucks if I hear the word fly by one more time I may shoot myself. They able to take this game and take it out back and throw it in the dump dumpster don’t ever play that again what a waste of an hour and 20 minutes
The worst of the worst. Boring video, and awful game. Sorry guys. bad choice. I BLAME E.J.
Wow is Mom upside down
that game suckssssssssssssssssssssssssss!
Fast forward to next game.  But the entire video was this horrible game.
Regal Riches, much better game😊!
Fire it in there boyz!
And now, for your reading pleasure...𝙏𝒉𝙚 𝙒𝑩𝙂 𝙌𝒖𝙚𝒔𝙩𝒊𝙤𝒏 𝒐𝙛 𝙩𝒉𝙚 𝘿𝒂𝙮 𝙁𝒓𝙤𝒎 𝒕𝙝𝒆 𝒀𝙤𝒖𝙏𝒖𝙗𝒆© 𝘾𝒐𝙢𝒎𝙚𝒏𝙩𝒔!! For Casino Manager Adam...please tell everyone about the employees of the El Cortez that are spending eternity in the basement. It's a lovely gesture from the late Mr. Gaughan...and does it continue today?    Bonus 𝙒𝑩𝙂 𝙌𝒖𝙚𝒔𝙩𝒊𝙤𝒏 𝒐𝙛 𝙩𝒉𝙚 𝘿𝒂𝙮 𝙁𝒓𝙤𝒎 𝒕𝙝𝒆 𝒀𝙤𝒖𝙏𝒖𝙗𝒆© 𝘾𝒐𝙢𝒎𝙚𝒏𝙩𝒔!! Now I most certainly do NOT say this, nor do I think this but I have to ask...how many times by how many people do you guys hear people say something similar to "got more money than sense"?
What a boring game and video. I literally had to fast forward all of it. Please never play this again.
I have that game at my casino here in Indiana...and I'm not touching it!!  :)
That gave me the worst slot blue balls yet!
What a Horrible game🤨🤮🤮🤮
This game is boring! Sorry guys
Come to Macau !
Where is the best place to be to watch you playing?
No wbg question of the day today?
Please don’t play this game again, it was horrible to watch.  Regal Riches is a far superior viewing experience
WOW, it was terrible.  Glad it's not in NV. Stay safe 🙏 ❤️
For the love... just let the bonus play out instead of hitting the button !
Wolf peak is all we want
Don't like this game
Looks like that game is a sando😂
Time flies by watching this game!
37$ is a joke preferably watch another YouTuber
Just awful game
Omg....hard to keep watching this...
For the 1st time ever...I fast-forwarded to the end to see how much you lost.
Have you ever gotten a royal right away? Or have they all been a grind. This question is for everyone.
Out of all of you W 2 seems to be the one with common sense, WBG will sit there and blow smoke up your ass.
I think it's called Adderall
The game was excellent when they played it in Wisconsin. Maybe the machine next to it would have paid better.
Rough to watch. Even the music on the machine made me sad
wtf
what an awful game
First time since I began watching you for more than a year that I was bored senseless.  Horrible game
Garbage game!!
The bass in that video made it unwatchable
Boring game
Wisconsin has like a 98% RTP and is more like bingo backend, probably why you did so good out there.
Is this machine like Regal Riches, in that each bet amount has its own spin amount on the rockets?
WBG QOTD (with pre-ramble please 😁):  Do you think you would all be friends if it weren’t for your common gambling interest?  What do you like best about each other and what do you think are each person’s redeeming qualities?  Love and appreciate you guys!  Thanks for the entertaining content.
1:24:16 hey guys, this game sucks.
Why did ej pick this game
QUESTION for Eugene.  EJ  Can you elaborate on what you like about fishing?  Style of fishing you enjoy, ie….sight fishing, trolling, wade fishing, tight lining a red worm on the bottom, surf fishing, fly fishing etc.  Do you have a favorite species you like to target?  I encourage you to try catching a steelhead on a fly.  That’s not part of the question, just a suggestion.
this game is shit
While in Arizona, did you put on your rainbow shades?
Dumbest game ever.
Now we know why this game isn’t in Nevada…it sucks!!!!
I appreciate the attempt to try something new.  That said, wow, that was bad. After 3 or 4 straight bad bonuses, maybe switch to a different game?
Do you guys leave Las Vegas when the iHeartRadio music festival is going on?
You guys goin live tonight
If Matt Was To Sell His Winner’s Bracelet,How Much Would You Ask For It ??????????🎉🎉🎉❤❤
I have an idea once a month you guys should play some sort of drinking game where Matt has to drink and get drunk during the show
Get your friends and family to subscribe to get to 1.5 million. Matt keep reminding people. You are my favourite and I want you to stay on top❤
Graphics wise regal ritches is a 10 out of 10 but this here game is about a 6...
Q of the day: When to Europe to play slots?
Love you guys… but man that was hard game to watch. Not a fan amigos
Yeah, please don’t even play this game again….so boring
Back to Buffalo 🦬 🦬 Thank you for the fun entertainment.🎰🎰
They’ll play this game and only this game for 1.5 hours - for a $13k loss… But won’t play Wolf Peak for more than 10 minutes! Make it make sense!
Jazz pianist, performer author and one of the early artists to create "fusion jazz"
Lets Go
Matt can't jump over the Sunday paper.
Change the name of that game to "The Challenger" cause that rocket just exploded in your face. 😢
Rocket Rumble is one of the worst slots I've ever played.
This has to be the worst video I've ever watched by yall
That game sucks
Good luck
We need a “you’re never out of it” counter
Love the channel guys! QOTD How is Matt doing with giving advice on discord? Any good anonymous questions you could share? And has anyone taken your advice and followed up with the outcome?
I would rather have watched grass grow than this game
i was WRONG in my first comment. that was the GREATEST GAME i have ever seen.   now i know why this was one of the LONGEST VIDEOS you guys ever made. . . . . . . .
its rigged you cannot win
Russian speaking in background?
This game like EJ, freakin sucks....literally annoying..."fly by"
Total f ing wreck
Looks like you are over betting. Truly bad
I  hate fast spins
You act like the biggest idiot sometimes why fast spend 12 spends but not when you get 35 spends very very frustrating to watch.... Wow
LMFAO is the name of the group who makes the song. “Party Rock”
It’s because you were expecting it
boring. One $5000 bonus didn’t change my mind. I have seen so many people get wrecked on this one.
Not loving this game
This is not criticism, just some thoughts. Why not change your bet amount. You were doing better when you were changing your bets.  Also, if a machine isn't giving anything back, try another machine. As always, better luck tomorrow.
The “Asian” characters are Chinese.  It’s 福, Fu, and it means blessing.  The golden “bowl” or “pot” is actually ancient money from China.  It’s called 元宝， Yuan Bao , and it’s like a good ingot. It is also called sycee .
❤❤❤❤
Question: do mom’s of daughters who meet Matt try to fix EJ up with their daughters?
That was awful.But still better than working . You’ll get them next time.
You guys back in vegas next week?
Less than optimal but liked it
Far too long of a video.  We went from heart stopping $211,000 to this.   Guys?
WBG ❤ Question of the day who has won the most at one time out of you guys and were did u win the most and what game was it thanks alot.😮
That game is bum cheeks
They have this game at spotlight 29 in California
Well, they can't say you didn't try hard enough.
Even Elton John would have ditched that game….
Not crazy about this game.  Glad it isn’t in Vegas
rocket go ploop
What casino in az is this at I Wana play it lol!
Fire it in there  🇮🇪 🍀
QOTD for Chip. Before this Big Beautiful Journey, what did younger Chip want to do when he grew up? After Chip answers I’d love to hear everyone else’s answer
I attempted to play this one in NC shortly after watching you guys play it a while back. I got completely wrecked to the point I don’t even venture to the side of the casino where it’s located. I got lightheaded just watching this video. Please add it to the walk by list.
BLUBERI HAS BEEN AROUND FOR OVER A DECADE IVE BEEN PLAYING THEIR OTHER MACHINES FOREVER IT SEEMS LIKE BUT THEY ARE CLASS 2
Should’ve left all you’re phones at home
Hated that game, waste of money
Wow. Yall out did yourselves picking the worst game in the world!  Who picks those crap games??
U all need to be more positive!  It’ll work. No more negative talk
Flyby flyby flyby ! Fucking fly by ! 😂😂😂😂❤. J.k.
😴
$37.50 was asking for disaster
Can NOT believe y’all made me watch this whole thing for that ending LOL
LMFAO…..😂
Rocket Rumble was probably the most boring and uninspired game you have ever done. You even tried to make it better with fast spins. It didn't work.
This games a sando my local casino has it, never play it.  No where near potential of buffalo gold.
Snoozer 😴
I think I’ll watch these videos now to put me to sleep because holy shit that was annoying to watch
I was staying at a hotel/casino and saw that the counter was at like 91 for the Red spins.  This lady was standing next to the machine, not playing.  So I asked her if I could play.  She FREAKED out on me saying "If you think you're going to get it, YOU'RE NOT! You can just leave!  I know all the numbers!"  I was like ookkkk this lady is crazy and played other things for awhile.  Was there about 2 hours, she never got off.  I decided to go back to the room and then come back the next morning.   THIS LADY WAS STILL ON IT!!! Her 91 had only climbed to like 94 after playing all night long.  So I decide to go back to the room again and wait till later that night to check again.  over 30 hours after seeing her, SHE WAS STILL ON THE MACHINE!!!  Her counter was up to 98 and it was getting pretty late so I didn't get to see how much she won but I can't imagine she won back what she put in there.   Absolutely insane!
Is one of u from Michigan u are always mentioning Michigan
Everyone who's played Rocket Rumble before died a little inside when we saw what number you started purple from.
OMG, that game is such a ripoff.
I’ve calculated at this rate you will have lost back your 200k jackpot by next Wednesday.
QOTD: Does WBG spend his entire day thinking of puns to make out of every day conversation? Or do they just puncture your thoughts without warning?
QUESTION OF THE DAY... do any of yall have any special skills that you are good at or just really enjoy doing... for instance wood working, painting, tadpole hunting...
Where do you'll find these terrible games I see why you can't find that game nowhere
EJ’s idea to play this trash?
All of you are very smart. Do you guys know your IQ score?  I would love to know.
EJ you are Full of CaCa.
This game is VM favorite game becuse he love`s too loooooos.
Disaster
Wow that game is nothing like buffalo Link
Welcome back to Phoenix :) amazing day weather wise good timing
On this game I love fast spins
Wonder why they lose so much cause they pick awful games.
You need a shirt that says "What Happened?"
I wish they would play more old school , 3 reel , and play more than 5 mins on it
Should've changed mochines
What casino ??? Casino Arizona???
I have to say this was my first most boring session with you all   Didn’t really like the game and it seemed relentless to horrible bonuses   Sorry for your loss today   Best of luck tomorrow!!!
AI Summary of this video:   EJ:  Fly By, Fly By, Fly By, Fly By, Fly By
what's a fly by
Love ya Matt but you play some of the most boring games… who in his right mind plays this? Yawn
This one was a miss
I love you all, I really do… but 90 minutes on one game with disappointing bonus after disappointing bonus?? This was tough to get through. I’m sure you’ll be back with more exciting (and hopefully more brief) content tomorrow. See you then!!
Need a like 25-30 min black jack session from you guys 😢
58:38 - w2J joke “ it depends if he’s staying with his wife or his girlfriend”
"Riveted" ❤
QOTD, WBG,who has the most hrs in the casino over the yrs?
Fastspins are good in my opinion. Follow instinct.
I'd play Rockets Rumbles alot in New York State.   When I'm in one of the free game bonuses if your collected rockets are equal or greater then games spun I like to call it keeping up with the Jones's.  You know your outcome is gonna be great.   Also I always fast spin this game.  Best game ever.
Why don't you take the button away from Vegas Matt during the bonus he's to impatient 😂😂😂
I enjoyed this game but they removed it from my main casino in San Diego. It was nice to see it again, especially cuz I don’t normally have the patience or the funds to chase one of the longer bonuses
QUESTION OF THE DAY!! Where are these tequila shots for the $200k grand? A deal is a deal
you winn alot on this game yeeee shit game soooo boring too watch.
Since EJ is a fan of fishing you should design a cool t-shirt for him that says "MASTER BAITER" 😂
Holy hell was this video just absolutely awful.
I love you guys but don't love the fast spins the whole time. Intermittent fast spins are cool but not every spin
Lady lucky won all the money yesterday.
Hey guys! QOTD what is you're favorite road trip / plane ride snack? What is your must have for a trip?
Stayed on this game to long
Goal of the game is to get bonus with no line pays. Goal of the bonus is to get extra spins with no extra money.
That’s life giving money every day to a computer screen. Llwlwwllllwllll
Skipped the whole game that was a load off asssss and the fast spin 😢
How often does graffiti guy come?? Well it depends on how hard he shakes his can…..🤦🏻‍♂️
And you guys talk bad about Huff and Puff
If Vegas Matt stopped trying to advance the bonus so fast you would have got way more fly bys
😴
I’ve never found a Buffalo Link in Washington state
QOTD: Matt are you a Howard stern fan? I hear you say “hey now” a lot and that’s ones of sterns favorite lines. Did you hear the big prank he just pulled a few weeks ago on everyone that thought he was cancelled?
This game is awful
28 minutes in and this rocket game sucks I don’t know how you win money
WBG QOTD: In a recent episode you had a lot of tickets for $2499.99 what happened to the missing cent? You guys don’t like anything less than $100 bills so don’t see you having pockets full of coins
This channel has really down hill in the past year smh
WHAT A SANDO DAY!
🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️
I think pocket rockets are a better name
Question of the day:  Is it awkward to film in casinos still? I love watching folks walk by and look at you guys with the most puzzled looks, like they've never seen a camera in a casino.
Fly By? I say your wallet fly by about 20 minutes in.
WBG Qotd: WBG, did you actually show the others the song I sent you on X? You said you liked it. But I don't know if the rest of the gang even heard it. Cheers from Norway
I’m a huge fan of Rocket Rumble but everywhere around Tulsa took it  out
Good luck on a win win gang gang!
WOW!
What a stupid fuking game to play. Had to of been Ejs decision
I’m not the biggest fan of this game, still love the video
One of the worst games 😂
QOTD….How do you determine how long the daily is..seems like 45-50 minutes??
I love WBG'S sense of humor 🤣
WBG❤
WBG question of the day... Who would win in an arm wrestling competition out of the core four, whom from the extended cast would you invite or excluded.
What a dud!!
This is a great game to stimulate a nice nap!
I don't wanna sound negative, but is this another lame game?I can't believe I'll just stick on a game and keep playing it.And playing it and playing it and losing and losing and losing, i'm out of here have a great day.Good luck
W2 seized the first opportunity today regarding people coming faster but passed up when Matt served him a home run pitch “how often does graffiti guy come?” lol
Fire it in there Friday! 😊
BORING
QOTD: Am I the only one who doesn’t understand how to take a screenshot of my question? How is it unique to me? Couldn’t anyone do that and send it in? Any elaboration on the details of that would be helpful for the less technologically advanced viewers.
I live in Saudi Arabia. How can i order your sando shirt😊!
The fly by flew away
Party Rock by LMFAO, with Red Foo and Sky Blu
game blows
It’s obvious how Matt and EJ met (maybe) but how did the rest of you guys meet and how did it turn into the giant following you have now?
480 is Michigan zip code. I’m from there.
maybe they will come faster..... SOME PEOPLE DONT LIKE THAT! got me
What a sad game.
You guys got WRECKED! That game SUCKS!
Well maybe next time
My first episode was the $750 a spin regal riches two years ago almost to the day. I've watched every day ever since.
I have a question for everyone: What is your favorite popcorn flavor/toppings?
I’m on my way to Az in a few days miss playing at my favorite Casino
You idiots get absolutely hornswaggled in that game and continue to play it? Make it make sense. Then bitch when you’re “down for the year” I wonder why?
Where are you guys playing in Arizona?
What a disaster, not one fly by in 36 spins, that game had it out for you guys!!!
VM you hit right when you put in a new ticket, thats why alot of people cash out and put the ticket back in!! it works more than getting 3 gems on mo mummy!  Also, Rocket Rumble has the absolute worse bill acceptor,  brand new 100s taking 10 tries to get them in doing 32 a spin sucked.  bill acceptor is bad enought I don't even like to play it anymore.   Even though its the funnest game i have ever played.  I even had a slot tech come look at it and it took him 5 tries, I ended up feeding another machine a few hundo's to make a big ticket so i just had to do it once ever 1000. wow the good green was almost 3 times the purple, that is bad!
oh yeahhhh oh yeah   oh yeah  lmao  ugh
I wish I could fast spin through this video... oh wait!
What an anoying game, most of the bonusses seem soft capped no matter the number of spins.
Video is too long  !! 😂😂
EJ when you yelled out " do ta tee do" all I could think about was when my kids were little and I would give them empty paper towel rolls to play with. They would run around the house going "Do ta tee do!" Thanks for the smile 😃
With the Marine Corps 250th birthday coming up, would you all like to do something to celebrate it?
I can't believe Matt didn't get nut tapped for those bonus fast spins!
Party in the house 🎉🎉🎉🎉
WBG QOTD❤If you were invisible for one day where would you go and what would you do ? Thanks for letting us hang out with you guys you’re honestly a tonic when times are not so good 😘
For the first time ever, a fast forwarded thru 95% of the video, hoping you'd switch to an enjoyable game. Please don't ever play that shit again.
That game sucks now I know why it’s not in Vegas
I have a interesting question? Why did yall go on the “Lucky experience” if yall rag on the sayings so much and say you don’t like it? Lol. Was it just for the fun?
That’s what you get for chasing bonuses. Very rarely turns out well.
Fast spins are unwatchable
I still don't care for it I'm glad you made money but it will take it all away change machines😅😅
10:30 I chuckled 🤭
LMFAO Bonus!
I'm sorry but that game sucks and its very boring to watch  !!
Good luck Vegas Matt and Crew! Know this is a favorite of your group! Hope you have a great session! Thanks for the great content!
WBG QOD for WBG, with your poker background why have you not suggested the great Phil Laak’s phrase when talking about being off the high water mark as being Upstuck?
The dumbest game ever. Stop playing stupid games 😢
This game is so boring to watch, chasing for nothing.
One person I can see why they are stubborn and sat there until $13k innage is gone. But ALL 4 people allow this to happen. IDIOTS, that is what Vegas Matt said. Not FUN at all!
Very boring game, had to fast forward this one.
18:13 they literally stole your bonus
Imagine you guys didn't have the best time on that game... as a viewer,  it was like wading through molasses in Wellington boots.  Hope you won something  - had to fast forward, hoping SOME of the 1hr25 minutes would be on a decent machine...
Wayyyyyyyyyy too long a video just for that one game. First video i’ve ever had to skip through.  Terrible game 💩💩
Victory laps are how Vegas matt gets his cardio in. I hope you have a lot more of them and overcome the losses for the year
I am a Model 63 like Matt . I can Ollie a Deck a foot and a half with a yard in vertical. And yes Tai Chi. Mastery of Inner Energy!
Got a chunker on a Friday almost an hour and a half, hell yeah!
Awesome game! Great day!
That game sucks!
WHY do W2 always have to JINX the bonuses.. just Let it play out, Stop asking questions 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Fast spinning sucks.
Sometime you need to find Buffalo gold wheels of reward and play it.
30 minutes into the game and the only fly by im seeing is the game flying by taking all of your money
Vegas Matt is a disaster on the button during free games ...lol
I heard that if you blast off too much your palms get hairy😂
Love watching a slot machine that pays you 2 bets in the bonus. Thanks for showing what machine not to play
Sometimes I wonder how you guys can be down 300K for the year and then I watch you literally throw all of your money away (and not even have fun while doing it)
What’s everyone’s best win on a slot. Preferably off camera stories. Did that become a favorite slot before or after the win?
Will someone get that Grandpa off the button.  I believe he has Steve syndrome.   The object of game is to catch the streaming tail of the colored rockets them quick stop after first.  They come in 2s and 3s
Happy Birthday Toni nice to be so young have a great day🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
WBG are you honest?  .. if yes then answer me this question and you don't even have to read it on air. Have you ever read a question from someone who already won from QOTD?. P.S.  Matt is off his game with the "That's what she said", there's been a few times he missed that were lined up perfect and he let them slide.
QOTD: What is your most embarrassing moment? 🤔
Well the boys are doing lots of moaning and groaning on the rocket slot bonus payouts.  I think that they forget that they are betting just $37 compared to their customary $50-$75??
Good luck 🍀 ❤
this game is ass,
Wow, I watch every day but that game was painful watch.
lamest game ever!
No good game yosay
EJ what is a do do do?😅
I feel like you're a mistake was staying on the same game the whole time
Negative ghostwriter, the pattern is full!  😂😂
In the words of the ever so wise WBG, this game is ass!
Did you really just play that game for 1 hour and 20 minutes and that was the video? What the heck?
COMPLETE sando first game. No wonder Vegas doesn’t have the machine.
This game is without a doubt, the dumbest and most boring game I’ve ever seen in my life. I’d rather play pinochle in an old folks home. That would be more exciting.
You can hear Matt hitting the button during the bonus , In the middle of its natural spin, it's clear that it effects the outcome, maybe just for shits and giggles, Matt could just take his hand off the machine, just once, let's enjoy this attitude, would be so refreshing.
To each his own, but that game was about as exciting as watching paint dry.
Question...🎆🎆🎆 How did all of you become friends and does WBG and Wjesus get paid for the sessions also.🤔🤗🥰
You guys do a lot of traveling. If you were able to film in canada would you make a trip to the great white north?
24:05 Matt: Maybe they’ll come faster…  W2: Some people don’t like that…   ☠️ 😝 ☠️
Rocket Rumble is the kind of slot machine I'd expect in a seedy smoky bar. 😅😅😅
That games sucks
Underrated and under appreciated top gun joke….they don’t deserve you WBG 😂
Can Vegas Matt dunk on Vegas Baby’s goal? (QOD?)
WBG, they eliminate the symbols in order of most rare to most common.  If they eliminated the most common first, then you'd get a lot of big payouts early and getting 15 wouldn't mean as much.
The game isn't approved for Nevada because it can't be set at the legal payback percentage for Nevada or the game would operate at a loss of the casino because of the volatility of it. Its approved in other states like Arizona that have God awful payback percentages.  When I used to be involved in the regulatory testing of slot machines this was actually very common and you can see many slots outside of Nevada you've never seen there as you travel
QOTD: How were you able to set yourself up to be able to afford a 6, 7, or even an 8 figure bankroll?  Watching the recent loss streak was painful, and I wasn't the one losing the money, but watching you guys lose half an average person's salary in a day was pretty crazy.  This isn't intended to be judgemental - I'm just curious about how you got to this financial position.  Thank you if you see this!
W2 your skepticism of rocket rumble is infectious 😂😂😂🙌✌
🎼 _"Rocket sauce..."_  _"Rocket, rocket sauce"_ 🎶
maaaaan, that was tough
Question: With the upcoming jackpot tax change; how much money in taxes do you think you'll save over the course of the year?
Great game. High variance but consistent bonuses😅
ZZZZZzzzz...
QOTD for Casino Manager Adam (or any other casino manager):  Does the casino have any alert system in place to notify staff that a Grand Jackpot is about to be won, even if the players haven't completed the necessary spins yet? We know slot outcomes are pre-determined based on when the button is pressed, but does the casino know when a Grand is about to be hit well before the players do?
Put this on the banned list.
wow what a lucky baby. having uncles w2, wbg and ej is the literal jackpot
You guys are all so amazing I bless you with good luck for the rest of 2025 and beyond :) ☘️
............"negative ghost rider, the pattern is full"
As long as you get graffiti guy you’ll be alright.
Worst game ever😮
Making a note to myself——stay AWAY from this game!
I blame EJ for picking that game 😂.
I think they're making this fly by thing up
Yes , never mention fast spin again, it just spazzes out Vegas Matt's ability to determine when to use them 😊.
How many three and four hundred dollar bonuses can you get before you move
Rug Rocket. Loves the Rocket Bonus!
Question of the day for W2: I was watching a youtube video on pawn stars and I am pretty sure I saw you selling a coin. What was that experience like and can you go into more detail on how you got the coin?
Was that the black eyed peas
WBG QOTD:  this is actually geared a bit toward WBG, but all may answer:  what do you tend to order if the restaurant doesn't have what you want / what's your go-to if you're in an indecisive mood?  (And WBG specifically, if there are minimal to no vegan options, do you resort to a salad, and do you even enjoy salads?)  Thanks!
This game is insane...I don't like it...Too much going on...
Like watching paint dry in a Mexican prison!
WBG QOTD: Where and how did Vegas Mom and Vegas Matt meet?
Fast spins are the way tomgo
Wbg owes us a shot of Tequila for the Grand Jackpot
Good luck
??? Why keep playing this?
WBG QOTD:   You know this is a quick , but difficult question.   And the reason for this question because I think it relates to everyone, and I can see Vegas Matt having the most difficult time answering this question .  And if you are ready I’ll ask the question:    So it’s fair to say your all time favorite casino digital games are; Buffalo Cash, Dragon Link, and Ultimate X. If you were forced to choose one of these games to be eliminated from casinos forever, which would it be.   Been a daily watching for over 2 years , and have made the first comment on 104 straight daily videos .
It's obvious that when you hit the button during the bonus, the machine is like , I guess you want to have the bonus be over".
Wow that game sucks😂
22 minutes in i still dont know what a fly by is
Hopefully your in Arizona to see your granddaughter  I'm not there just for this game 🎯 because it sucks😢
must just say its the worst game you haver ever played worst episode ever
BORING!!!
Bet more please 😊 Also y'all rock
Welcome to the gay club.  🔥 it in there😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
New games are garbage 😅 waist of money, they keep finding new machines pays lesser
Fast Spins suck. Let the machines algorithms do it
Matt!!! It's a bonus, stop fast spinning your bonus .
Anyone else watch at 2x speed?
Question of the day, next time someone complains about a win over 1 thousand dollars, will you send the win to my bank account? :D
QOTD: how differently do you gamble on videos vs gambling in your individual lives? I know it’s a different bank roll but interested to know what games/bet amounts everyone is firing in there off-camera
Fire it in there Vegas Matt, I’ve been on a casino break for the month, but I’m still tuned into my favorite gamblers💪🏿.
Must say this was the first time I was bored with your game pick. Please never again
So negative not  fun to watch.  Need a shirt with all your negative comments😢
The constant fast spins are annoying.
This rocket game is so boring to watch
OOooooooo 1hr and 25mins episode.. I'm soooo excited ❤
Blast Off - as well-programmed as a gas station slot 😮
Blam EJ
QOTD: When you have 2 machines next to each other why don't Vegas Matt and EJ play both at the same time to see which is the hot machine? 🙌✌👏🎰🍀🐈
WBG QUESTION OF THE DAY,  What are Vegas Mom's favorite slot machines? Also what other games in the casino are her favorites? I would also be interested to hear this answer from the whole team.  Thanks for the authentic view of how gambling really happens.
Another ej loss
They have to be getting paid to play this slot no other reason to play it so long.
Wbg question of the day.?  Vegas Matt always speaks very highly of his father in videos. Who do you have in your lives that made an impact on you like Matt's dad did with him? Matt do you have a story from your dad that set you up for success in life? Thanks fellas.
Will Vegas Matt lose a million before the end of the year?
WBG QUESTION OF THE DAY???? Why have you guys stopped buying bonuses? I think you got wrecked less when you bought bonuses. You should have a competition on Monday every week, and the winner chooses the games for the rest of the week.
Garbage game, every bonus is designed to make you feel like you got close to a big win but it’s just torturous.
SORRY VEGAS MATT,W2,WBG, AND JMAN. I'm sorry you all use ur own money and r down big money but you still have people saying u all just grab money from viewers and people who come and see u. I didn't realize people were forced to but ur books, buy merchandise,  buy tickets to see u....lol ok now no more sarcasm....thank u all for giving m e great content for nothing in return.I understand you do get paid.However you all created content for us before ever getting paid. Never change thank u
10:47 Wait, VM wants to own a plane and doesn’t know the most famous aviation quote of all time?  10 demerits
Is the fly-by in the room with us right now?
Good luck Boys
What a stupid game.
Awesome
🫤
Change games come on guys win win grand jackpot energy😅😅😅
Boring game lads
Is the "fly by" in the room with us?
LMFAO
WBG the man the myth and the legend 😅😅
Ej sweetheart its auntie call me please ❤
Talking stick has gone away with the $200 hand pays a very long time ago. They’re hands down the best casino in the valley. TBH i kinda get the ick when you guys are in town and are only recording from wild horse.
ROCKETS IN FLIGHT!?!? Go guys!
This is the worst video so far.  Idiot does not how to gently hit button, messed up everything with his accidental fast spins.
I love W2 God like voice ❤❤❤❤
Scammed
Yeeeeah, best return ever! By the way, it just got certified in Nevada last month if the rumors are correct
What do you mean?People are going to start thinking you're making it up. I've been wondering for quite a while. Just kidding have fun good luck
Alot of people are saying that the smartest people play Paigow for get even or get even worse, alot of push so great for content
WG2has the voice Vegas matt has the heart EJ has the cutest laugh WBG has the brain you all remind me of the wizard of oz😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
The band that sings party rock is LMFAO
You should never play that game with the numbers that low when you start.😮
Party anthem is sang by lmfao
It all depends on the bonus that you will get eventually  But it could be a big sandooo
I can’t find rocket rumble
Must be at the Wild horse, if you went to Shula's Steakhouse.
Lame game and video was so long it felt really diluted. Skipped through the whole thing
Lmfao at they have a funny name
They don't have it in Nevada because that game is azz..
LMFAO
Good evening everyone. 🫡🇬🇧
QQTD- How often would you say you walk past a game like Ultimate X and notice multipliers left behind.  And when you do notice, do you go over to spin those off?
Blasting offff with Vegas Matt and Friends you don’t get any better rides than this!!
Very lucky Vegas baby to have a grandpa like you ❤❤and an uncle like EJ ❤️❤️
nice to watch in fastplay, 2 minutes of pleasure
WBG question of the day: what advice do you have for up and coming slot content creators? Market advice, niche videos. Anything that can help someone
Like this if you watch Vegas Matt everyday!
Qod...where do you guys see your life in 5 years..marrage kids grandkids more channels, lets look ahead!
AZ ! 😅
EJ we still love you❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤your so smart to do all the editing the mics the lives you carry on your shoulders😅😅
What was your worst medical procedure
I think W2 was channeling his WBG jokes with his "they have a funny name" for the group LMFAO.
What a garbage slot machine
QOTD does Vegas matt like skiing ??😅
What makes WBG think he’s in charge all of a sudden?
Get it!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Good luck guys your going to win today😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
About 100 miles away by Sedona! Just to busy pouring Gold then Silver to say Howdy but I May come to Reno for the BDay and bring the Mattijuana brand Buds!

You guys should head to Tucson. They’ve got a couple of casinos out there.. I use to go to them , when I lived out there.
boring
“20% of the food in her mouth and 80% on the floor of the restaurant”   My youngest son is the same age as Vegas Baby, and I can attest that 80% of the food on the floor is par for the course!
WBG question of the day.  Is there a movie that you have watched over and over again that you would recommend us to watch? And why would you recommend it?
EJ mentioning fast spin, and all of a sudden the bonus gets involved with fast spins.
Party Rockers in the House tonight LMAFO THE PARTY ROCK ANTHEM
the new meta Ray-Ban glasses are out you could record with them when playing?
It's time for wbg's question of the day day 8 question for casino manager Adam, what is the biggest comp the El Cortez has ever given out to one of its players or whales I have heard of people getting vehicles like Lamborghinis private jets what is it that the El Cortez has done for its customers?
I got the fly by top gun joke WBG 😂😅😂
Hopefully a lap of the house!make it massive,white house lap plz❤
Negative ghostrider, the pattern is full.
Boring ass video!!!
Stop pushing the button in the bonus. It ruins it. Enjoy it!
Awesome grand crew !!!
Another great day with Vegas Matt and crew !!!!
Now I’m watching you from Thailand!
"LMFAO" sings Party Rock
Well here again another great day and I hope you win EJ WB WBJ and of course the famous Vegas Matt.
BORING! Gotta love that FF BUTTON!
lmfap is the group
There are 2 books on amazon claiming to be “The art of winning” and about your life. One has you on the cover the other has a person standing on a mountain. Which one is yours and which is fake? I am assuming someone used AI to create a fake to sell to unknowing fans of yours.
Yep, Lets never do that again, hour and 25 minutes of absolute sando. What are we doing guys???
Hello to my favorite youtubers
🚀🚀🚀💥❤❤🎉
love you guys so much, you make the nights going through post partum depression so much easier to get through by helping me take my mind away. thank you for the years of entertainment and laughter. ❤
You mentioned you won 100k on the slot tournament, is there a way to watch it?
Im not 1st today.😊
Blast off 🚀 Wishing you guy's lots of luck 🎰🤑💰💵💰💵💰💵
QOTD. Since you spend a lot of time in casinos as do I, have you ever been approached by let's say professional women offering their services.   I assume they approach me more often when I'm in the high limit room because they assume I have money to spare on entertainment even though it may be the kind that I seek
Hi boys.
Let’s go! Fire it in there!
QOTD:I’m a weekend gambler and it’s time consuming my question for you guys is about how many hrs do you guys consume and do you guys ever think if it’s worth it.
Let’s get another GRAND! We have Rocket Rumble at our local casino here in Kansas. I’ll fire it in there tomorrow.

TGIF
I wait every day for these videos 😊♥️. I have remained a silent person up until a few days ago. After I watched that grand hit on Buffalo I have decided to share my love for you all. 🎉
Question of the day.  Have you guys played slots in other countries,  I always feel like there's lots of games like Lucky lady's charm, book of ra and more that you'd enjoy and they tend to give very big bonuses compared to bet size, are there any games in other countries you wish you had in Vegas?
Black Eyed Peas
QUESTION; How many days a month do yall travel?

QOTD: That Big Beautiful Buffalo Grand recently was the first Grand you’ve hit on your main channel right ? Shows how difficult it can be to hit one! I know you’ve hit another smaller Buffalo grand that you posted as a short, and you’ve won other Grands online. Can each of you share all of the Grands you’ve won in your lifetime and which was the most memorable to each of you ?
I am in Sierra Vista south of Tucson
Let’s get it
