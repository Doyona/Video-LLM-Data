Jackson Karen Anderson Brian Wilson Mary
Walker Nancy Garcia George Perez John
4 banners? Do they want to leave me without jades? 😅
Bro topaz is everywhere too in banner in quest and her minion 😅 everywhere not just argenti
I am gonna skip all banners for lingsha
E6 march hunt when
5:04 im only here because or March 7th  Not have time to watch live
Noooo!! How long must I wait to build my husbando team?
43:27 POR FIN!!!, después de tantas encuestas que llene pidiendo esto, SE LOGRÓ!!!! 😭😭😭😭
Does anybody know why we fight or her shadow was it?
Feixiao gives me Yoruichi from bleach vibes and I love it, I'm definitely pulling for her
42:44 🤣🤣🤣🤣
fai pull ling skip NEED QUANTUM
Lingsha is so powerful and complete. She heals and cleans allies; she attacks and debuffs enemies. Feixao and Lingsha are definitely gonna be new apex characters. Being a four-star character, hopefully Moze will perform like Gallagher.
Omg I’m late but I love it ❤❤❤I’m here ❤❤❤yasss❤❤❤
Nah -1 day 4 codezzz
Omg 2.5 be my doom😢😢😢

My wallet is now officially cooked. I want bs/kafka/robin but also want feixiao and saving for archer. It's even worse than feixiao rerun with doc cuz there would no question on pulling on his lc
Is it just me or Lingsha kinda talks like Rarity from mlp gen 4 😭
We get pet? WE GET PET??!
Bro there's no way they're rerunning all my favs when school started 😞
Why is that owl there? His voice is soo ugh… please stop him. It’s soo cringe

Друзья, нужно чтобы каждый из нас скинулся сколько не жалко, хоть по 30 рублей. Открыли сбор на продукты для благотворительной раздачи нуждающимся.  По вторникам и четвергам наши волонтёры едут на вокзал. Там, как обычно, выстраивается очередь нуждающихся в горячей еде людей. Среди них много пожилых и инвалидов. Стараемся никого не обделить, в меню суп харчо и чай с пирожком.  Помните, в прошлый раз наш жёлтый фургончик ломался? Так вот, новости плохие: он окончательно заглох. Мы приехали на своих, еле-еле получилось всё привезти: столы, 24-литровые баки с едой.  Сегодня открыли сбор на покупку другого фургона. Пока собрали только 24 тысячи из необходимых 400 тыс. Будем держать кулачки и надеяться,что до холодной зимы получится собрать всю сумму.  Сейчас сезон отпусков, поэтому понимаем, что многим не до пожертвований. Но всё же просим вас поддержать нас хотя бы в сборе на продукты для приготовления супа. Ещё нужно закупить чай, сахар и расходники: тарелки, ложки, перчатки, салфетки, мусорные мешки. Даже 30-50 рублей будут очень весомым вкладом!  В июле с вашей помощью получилось накормить более 500 человек! Хотим сказать, что гордимся вами!  Мы верим в человечность, верим, что с вашей поддержкой мы сможем накормить всех, кто придёт к нашему скромному столу на следующей неделе.  Пожалуйста, не отворачивайтесь от людей, многие из них не выбирали такую участь. Ситуации бывают разные. Поверьте, тарелка горячего супа может спасти жизнь кому-то из них. Реквизиты: 2202 2018 2112 2641 Сбербанк.🙏
La tenue de March 7 est magnifique❤.  Et sa technique à l'épée est trop stillé😮.
A PET. WE'RE GETTING A PET EVERYONE!!!!
Aff Hoyoverse, não dá pra falar bem de ti que tu consegue fazer a gente morder a língua. 4 t5 em um único Banner. Vou começar a falar mal de vocês em todo canto pra daí vocês se manterem fazendo coisas legais e não essas porcarias depois da gente elogiar vocês
We’re all cooked
My wallet will cry and scream.
Outfit is great, March
Thank you for 124 subscribers 😢

Wait, he said up to twelve points? Did they give feixiao her 12 stack ult back?
🗿
Luka screentime hell yess!!! It was so unfair that he only appeared in 1 quest before this
I was hoping for more characters per banner but like not like this lol
PETS YESSSSS
12:43 Yes, it happens, rabbits love chewing wires
Damn they really said replace Gallagher now.
49:12 Why is no one talking about this? "Casual Mode"
Dang I want feixiao but I also want black swan weapon and topaz to I expected her not to rerun this fast it is pretty weird
Wtf...
I hope they keep doing multiple reruns like this
Rabbits do in fact chew on cables lol

Sin lugar a dudas este juego cada vez me deja más sorprendido grande PadreRail. Estos si son juegos que sin lugar a dudas si quiere a sus jugadores.
I think in 2.6 is Sunday and rappa or rappa and Screwllum
really?? TOPAZ again?? Acheron would be good
Feixiao and Kafka Rerun! My wallet is not ready for this patch 😫 Side note 3D Vtuber Imaginary Marchy is adorable 😍 ❤️
clairement, à mon avis,  c 'est l' un des meilleurs live.
bunnies TOTALLY chew on wires, moze!
Genshin's 4th anniversary update: "HSR would never" HSR next update: "Nah I'd win"

Why tf are you saying MOZA for Moze?
I love this game
Jingliu babygirl is back
Хорошее решение с реранами персонажей 👍 Пусть игроки сами решают кого им забирать, и не придётся ждать этого кучу времени.
Well safe to say they just gave a reason for why they always give a 10 every new patch. Them mad lads making players choose between 4 very strong characters.
AVENTURINE WHEN
Looking great can’t wait for my Wind Mommy lol
17:41 that saying is from Fuhua😂
Bro is mad

I NEED BLADE, WHY IS TOPAZ BACK AGAIN 😭
They really went this way 💀
28:24 Oh hi Mozarella
Owlbert is asking to get turned in fried chicken with phase 1.
Boothill?!?! Lets gooooo!!!
I was about to cry about being too poor for Moze, but we are getting those update jades!
Nah i'd win
WHAT ABOUT SUNDAY?
Jingliuuuuuuuuuu
WHY IS MOZE SO SCARY
10000?!!!!!!!!! Wow
All im going to say is please no Pity Pulls for Feixiao, cause shes definitely going to be a must pull! isnt that what we play gacha games for. to pull on your favorite character that releases! good luck to everyone!
Topaz is getting another re-run, didn’t she just have one in 2.2???
Rip to our wallets 😭🫡
Bro topaz and robin that's insane 😭
Only 1000 free jades?  C'mon now don't be stingy with them, make it at least 1600 for 10 pulls.
Feixiao Kafka and topaz? I’m cooked
4 reruns  1 pet!!! Improvements in DU  1000Jades and 10 wishes. Thank you so much Father Rail 🎉
Banner is crazy but i shall stay strong for aventurine
Where is Kafka skin???
Nos morimos todos😢
My wife, Feixiao, I can't wait for you to come home.
We just skipping 2 rerun and going straight to 3?
Oh owo  Interesting:333  Hoping this update will bring even more joy and events 🫡❤️‍🩹
33:39 HoYo I expect Dr. Ratio rerun to be next to Aventurine's one
What do they mean by drop rate boosted. Earlier hard pity?
KAFKA!!❤
I have zero jades but I want all these characters bruh 😭
Robin AND Topaz reruns again so soon?? That’s crazy  6:46 LUKA LUKA LUKA LUKA LUKA god i hope that it isn’t just for promo  37:54 IT ISN’T JUST PROMO, MY FAVOURITE BOY IS GETTING ATTENTION, I’M SO HAPPY
Feixiao, Black Swan or Lingsha or bust!
WE LOVE FEIXIAO!!!!!!
Wait for archeron and aventurine
i can kiss my fate collab savings goodbye
Robin let's go home
Kafka? Or Feixiao?... A
51:40 bruh i wont be able to sleep tonight 💀💀
6 banners in a shot that's insane 😅
hamu in su i am dead
Y first phase has 4 character and second only 2
No puedo evitar Shippear a Lingsha con Dan Heng Siento que se verían muy bien juntos 😊🤭🤗
0:00 Se vienen los banner`s triples 🤩
She really said “chat” 😭😭😭😭😭
no acheron????
Goodbye Gallagher 😭😭😭
73 wishes spared up. Still dont know  whether to spend it on. BLACK SWAN E1 will work great with E0S1 kafka, but robin e1 is also really good for endgame. I dont have any wind dps too, so that would be good too. Btw limited banner is almost at hard pity.
I am saving for fate collab. Im saving for fate collab. Dear god this game is testing me so much.
1) 4 Reruns 2) 3 reruns first phase, only 1 second 3) Robin rerun earliest to date 4) Topaz rerun earliest to date, tied with Robin (Topaz's 2nd, Robin's 1st, but both still tied earliest compared to all reruns) 5) 3-4 FUA 5 star characters (Robin is best for FuA, but doesn't have a FuA herself, hence 3-4, others are Feixiao, Lingsha, and Topaz) 6) 2 5 star DoT characters (Kafka + BS is best DoT combo)  What is this patch...
I didn't know topaz and kafka finally had a second rerun it's crazy lol
I'm sad that there is no character's quest. There was only two character's quest from 2.0.
Feixiao EN VA is RedHood from Nikke lol
10/10 patch intro and bits with march and owlbert
Argenti is stalking us. He is in every event and quest haha!
I am loving that March was our reporter for this program and goodluck to everyone pulling for their respective characters cause man there are so many
Imagina ahorrar por Fei Xiao pars que te pongan 3 personajes legendarios al mismo tiempo 💀
3 re-runs? Are you CRAZY!? My poor wallet and sanity 😭
but now I would like Feixiao, Kafka, Black Swan and Topaz.  I can afford one besides Feixiao, who do you recommend I get?
Wait, if moze is coming in phase 1, then why is his signature weapon arriving in phase 2? That's so weird... unless I'm missing something?
30:21 Lingsha's Sneeze is sooooo cuutttesss
Ffs. 6 rerun banners? Sigh…
Going for Feixao and Topaz. FUA team 4ever! 🔥
WHERE’S AVENTURINE?!

I just had a thought. Can trailblazer use clockwork on feixiao and make her not mad?
MAKE ME WIN A 50/50 FOR ONCE  OH MY GOD
Crazy work they should have just extended rob/kaf/swan banners over both fei and lingsha banners or at least have them split equally
Well there goes my money
what if they put topaz here to do an aventurine x dr ratio rerun in patch 2.6 (copium)
WHERE IS RATIO BRUHHHH

Skippppppppp

8:06 Yesssssss she is back
Why not jing yuan you guys 😭
Skill kinda pissed they changed Fei’s 12 hit ult. I know it “technically” a DPS increase doing 2 ults with 12 points, but it’s way less fun and each ult feels weaker
OMG
you only need one kidney right?
3 banner rerun là có thật
51:42 ayoo??? Albert what!?
6:41 thats a battleship
So I’m going broke? Fun!

WHY IS TOPAZ HAVING A RERUN SO SOON😭😭 WHERE IS SEELE
IM GOING BROKE FOR FEIXIAO AND ROBIN (JADE WISE NOT REAL MONEY)
March 7th: "Hey Chat!" 😂🥰
Apart from planar organments and ascension materials which relics and trace materials we should grind?
Don't really care about luka tbh. Sushang would have been a lot more interesting.
