SPOILER BLOCKER

Vita fans 🤝 normal ppl            Hating g2
timestamop in the faze saw match where the guy in the crowd opened a knife?
If I had a million dollars for every time broky did a close peek, whiffed the shot and then turned around and missed the hipfire, then died; I'd be a billionaire.
