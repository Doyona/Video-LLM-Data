I love the fact that many people consider Disney too expensive. It keeps out the MAGATS and the rest of society can enjoy the experience.😂
I thought prices were way down?
Will never go there just because of that. So now Disney is for the rich.  They are pricing away people.
Ywah well you support that woke place your problem no news here
Its worse under this administration you bimbo
People quit going to Vegas because of the price increases!! Now Vegas is on the verge of collapse!! People stop going to Disney!! It is in your hands to stop this!! Show them who is in control!
Take your kids to natural parks, they are free! Why must you go to Disney!
Ignorant people are born everyday.. thank God im 6 years alone
Kids Run the Parents while Parents are foolish enough to be weak and Cave. Poor Parenting just wanting to be 'Friends'. Wake up. Go to a park. Turn off their cell phones. We All know you never will do that. Why teach your kids...
Today's Disney is all about getting your money.  Marketing is powerful!!
As a kid there in California ! It only cost a $ 1.25 to get in to have fun all day , a book of tickets  was only $ 2.25  ,. Half the time we snuck in
I am a local in Orlando with an annual pass with Disney and Universal Studios... I eat before I go to parks. The last time I ate was at EPCOT MEXICO chips, guatemala and 1 margarita. The bill was $38.00
Who can afford that for entertainment,   when people can't afford to eat.  Disney cut your profit
Ridiculous!  Wake up Disney!
HOW GROSS.  SUPPORTING DISNEY.  THE GIRL SAYS WORTH IT.  FLORIDA CULTURE PROMOTES THIS.  ITS ILLEGAL 2BE HOMELESS THERE.  BUT GIRL IS SWEET LOVES FAMILY.
The cost of a Disney day trip is given air time, while some trips to the grocery store are wiping out a families --- seem in poor taste. People are being economically devastated --- and hes upset over a day trip to a Disney Theme Park. Very poor taste to flaunt yourself about. Must have been a very slow News Day. SMH
Hes trying to pinch penny"s?  And he goes to Disney world......wowza!
Would not spend a penny at ANY thing Disney. Shameful industry.
Most families can't afford to do disney, because day to day expenses are too much!!  Groceries!!!!
Someone has to make up for the massive losses from the "woke" movies.
The have and have nots.  If that many people there,    President Trump most be doing a great job.  Nice to see people  with money, instead of all the negative stuff in the news..
Back in 2004 we bought 4 annual passes with no blackout dates and parking included. The price - $200.00 each (coupon from Entertainment Discount Book). We went to the park a total of 42 days that year. We loved it and got it out of our system at the same time.
No Disney!! Used to fun and affordable. Who's running this now??😢
It’s an experience🎉
You are stupid and guilible to pay in the first place.
Should have gone on a carnival cruise it's cheaper 4 day or 5 day
I went back in 1988 in high school. It didn’t cost that much. Omg it has really gotten up there. I even found my Disney ticket a few months ago. I put it in my scrap book.
DUMP DISNEY!
I agree it was outrageous. But, you paid the money to enter then made the bad choice to spend more to eat. Sorry, that's just plain stupid.
Myself I would never spend $1 on this rubbish 🗑
Las Vegas is doing the same they don't want  commoners
This is heartbreaking to see what Walt Disney World once was, and now it has gone to the dogs and you have to spend more than what it used to be.
As long as suckers like him pay those prices, it will never change.
America is $$$$$$ killing America!!!!!
OMG.  I can't afford Disneyworld.  Bye.  From Fallon Nevada.
Overpriced and overrated 😢😢😢
It's so sad....Not really. Don't go. Problem solved. It takes very little to have fun with kids. They are creative, fun, and energetic by nature.
They should re name it the land that bends over parents the best😂
The happiest place in the world is gone. It’s been replaced by the greediest place in the world.
Grew up in Southern California and enjoyed Disneyland for many years. Now, way too crowded, way to expensive, and somehow less magical. I won't return.
He may want to think twice about buying tickets to the forthcoming RUSH reunion tour! The cheep seats (where you can't see or hear anything) start at just-under $200...!
Notice how the FOX commentator still had to work in “ prices were better than during the last administration “. If prices are lower now it’s because Trump drove tourists away. In Canada, we’re bombarded with ads offering 25% off. With the exchange rate it still works out to regular price.  And then there’s the air fare to get there, and the possibility of being detained for no reason.😢
Serves you right, you must have known. Why do Americans believe they must do fkn Disney
Complaining about high cost of Disneyland just tells everyone that you’re not rich!
Fox saying it's gotten better.  Propaganda
So don’t go there dummy
fk Disney I hope they go bankrupt
This man needs to learn how to use the internet.  Just wants attention.  If Disney is too expensive, go camping.
I doubt that most of the people pay cash for anything now days so they don’t really own just renting it!
Went once 20 years ago. Never again
MAY GOD BLESS THE BEST MAGA  HONORABLES PRES TRUMP AND VICE PRES VANCE. STOP all evil illegal  demrats attacks against them now !!!
YOU ARE THE DUMBEST OF FLORIDIANS!!!!!
There only 100 000 of them its time
The rich are out of control
Stop financial slavery
Definitely not worth for any children under the age of  5 .❤
He is a business owner.  He knows the cost of doing business.  Food cost, employee salaries, utilities, ...just like a homeowner.  STOP bellyaching...pay it and have fun.  OR...go to a LEFT WING protest....and enjoy the visuals.
DINNER FOR 6 MONTHS...OR 2 DAYS IN MOUSE PARK
I’m 74.  Back in the 1950s, I was a kid.  Parking was 25 c.  Joke was,  as you exit Disneyland, they turn you upside down, shake out every last quarter or coin from your pockets!,. lol❤
Its ok to look mickey in his eyes and tell em no 😅
Disney has gone from a day out for a working class family to a once in a lifetime experience (that's no longer enen worth that)
That's why when we visited Florida we didn't go. Beach is free.
Disney and Vegas are both price gouging now, forget both of them. Let 'em go broke.
Expensive or not for tourist is not the major reason against global tourist to American.  For Asian is the racist and crime.
Start with criticize the propaganda, brainwashing and educating people with racist mindset.  This just directly damaging tourism industry.  Tourism industry generate trillions of hidden income for wide range of people.  From windscreen cleaners at the traffic light, store selling produces between highway,  to individual selling sovereign and drinks on the street to small businesses...
The one honest Fox report. Keep it up.
I THOUGHT EVERYBODY WAS SAYING THAT IT WAS EMPTY?
Boycott Israel! Boycott Hollywood! Boycott Disney! Boycott Netflix! Boycott all products and companies that feed Israel's atrocities and the genocide in Gaza!
THE BOYCOTT MUST CONTINUE. DISNEY DID NOT REINSTATE KIMMEL TO PROTECT FREEDOM OF SPEECH, THEY DID IT TO PROTECT THEIR SHAREHOLDERS.  THE BOYCOTT MUST CONTINUE.  IT MUST ALSO INCLUDE COCA-COLA. WHICH COINCIDENTALLY IS SOL IN DISNEY PARKS. THE BOYCOTT MUST CONTINUE.
I don't blame Disney....I blame the people who go there......last week Disney raised their prices ...good for them......
Dude. Just say no then to the family. If your complaining about it you shouldnt of gone then.
Lost Vegas  is to much also dont waste  your money this is all greed
Way way to muck for a company  that is woke liberal and anti American  don't  waste your money
I wouldn't take my Grandkids to anything associated with the Queer Woke Disney enterprise!!
This really is newsworthy? I cant believe people don't do research to understand the costs beforehand and then complain. Fox, get a life and report real news. This is nothing more than the Jerry Springer show. WOW
US is now unaffordable for tourists
Yet Liberals don't gripe about woke Disney.
Well, he admits she used the card way too many times too.
I have a solution... Don't go to Disneyland...
Is Disneyland a mirror of Las Vegas?  A total rip off!
It's all make believe. The marketeers sell all that crap to your children and play on your emotions.   The food and drink are below average at best. The crowds and the lines are ridiculous. Parking and the gift shop? Forget about it!!
Somebody got herself extra dessert😅
The little girl shouldn’t forget it as it’s likely the only time she will get there.  No repeat customers.  A good business is about repeat customers.  A failed business plan.
Exactly why I have t been to Disney for over twelve years and won’t even subscribe to and Disney+.  Out priced for young families and even a grandparent to bring them.  Come to Canada’s Wonderland!  Way cheaper and beautiful!
You are funding disney Lgbtq agenda !
Under the last administration? Nice FOX!
The cost was the reason I never made there
The house of mouse.
Boycott ABC DISNEY erc etc They are Trump loving cowards
Fox likes big business and not helping the average person, so what's the problem?
We used to take our kids to the New Forest for the day. Great day out, doesn't cost a penny. Plenty of good pubs around for lunch as well. 🇬🇧 😊
Disney stinks with the woke propaganda
Boycott everything Disney! Totally unacceptable overpriced woke nonsense!
I went in 1976 when you bought a book of tickets for some A, B, C, D, and E rides. I think my girlfriend and I spent $50 for the day.
$974 that’s a deal $1500 for 5 with park hopper and lightning lane for a one day Sunday excursion I just priced it out for March 2026,granted that is close to Springbreak! $30 for parking at DW, it’s $35 for just DL so again, “Deal”! By the way this is sarcasm just in case this comment fails to translate! lol pricing has gone insane!
BOYCOTT DISNEY
Boycott Disney! That is ridiculous amount to pay for any theme park…corporate greed at its finest. Kids want quality time…it’s not going to happen at Disneyland with the stress and crowds.
It's a rip off
I spent $1k every day and I have one kid. 😂 don’t go if you broke
Although I haven't seen this video before but she is talking about the cost to go to a Disney Theme park in Florida,1,400 Dollars for one day is kinda outrageous, when my kids were born,I took them, with my wife to Six Flags and also it's not cheap, from the parking,rides, and food prices,Man what an experience, but as long as the kids had a Good time, that's All That mattered to me and my wife, but Disney anything, you better be willing to shell out the Coin, and they don't tolerate excuses, Take It Or Leave It,is there Motto, just like Broadway in Midtown Manhattan, you talk about expensive, everything is expensive and very busy, crowded streets, sidewalks, that's why they say,New York City, Never Sleeps, it's the Hustle And Bustle of City Life, especially in NYC, never a Dull Moment.Cha,Ching,Cough Up Buddy Pal.
Sorry. Costs and inflation are higher under the current administration. Facts matter
I went with my wife and young daughter to Florida Disney for the first time in 2004. The price of the park was doable but still expensive. The price of Hotels, car hire, food etc was exceptionally good value. We kept on revisiting yearly until 2022. I would never go again to Florida. By this time the prices for everything had become obscene. The Disney tickets and Universal tickets are now outrageously expensive. Car hire is stupid money. Villa hire is reasonable. But let me tell you, the price of eating out and generally the food shopping is a disgrace. I thought the UK had become expensive to live but if Florida is the example then the USA is stuffed. 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧😢😢
Why dad & daughter only? Where are his wife & son? Or i suppose theres an agenda here…. 🍀
Congratulations MAGA you have what you want the pinokio convicted criminal on is destroying our democracy and our country I hope all of you are happy when you lose your job your house because no work but you can go to the farmers and peek some fresh fruit and vegetables 🌽
Disney doesn't care. The lines are long so that tells them everything is great.
Warning DO NOT GO TO THIS WOKE AS HELL PLACE , THIS IS THE HOME OF THE PEDAFILES, over priced big time , crowded as hell , if you go protect your kids
I hear from so many people how much Disney costs. I paid less for a six night seven days all inclusive in Aruba .
Outrageous, so not worth it. I would have rather do something else with $1400
Why waste money on going to Disney World? I'd rather go on a hiking trip. I remember my father taking my two older brothers and I on a hiking trip, teaching us about nature, and making it a fun adventure. That's one of my best childhood memories with my father and two older brothers. 😎🇺🇸
Blackrock stopped subsidiaries to cover their wosses.
I guess we all prioritize how we spend our money- and what makes us happy. It's not Disney's fault if people choose to spend their money there. It's no secret that The Disney Parks are an upscale, premium experience; Disney clearly states their prices on its websites, and does not force anyone to visit their parks.  I have friends who regularly purchase $300 Nike Shoes several times a year, will spend $40 a night drinking at bars & restaurants, purchase $15 worth of Starbucks coffees and $3 bottled water every day, and will regularly drop $200- $300 a week on baseball, football, and hockey game tickets/food/beer/sports memorabilia.  Not my desire to spend my money on all of those things, but, hey, it's their money and if it's worth it to them,  I'm happy they derive enjoyment from doing so.👍
It looks like Disney has plenty of business with their long lines. As long as people keep coming, the prices are going to keep going up.
Dad was unprepared ……that’s all.
Pizza Hut for 20 dollars for 20 hours
Put them parasites out of business 😂
90 % stopped going
Oh hell no I would never spend that much money for 1 day. I’d take my family camping to a national park and spend time in nature instead. When I grew up my parents would take us across country  in a camper for 6 weeks in the summer. I was fortunate enough to have a dad who could afford it some of the best memories I have. I’ve been to all 50 states now finally got to Hawaii and Alaska America is so beautiful and diverse 👍🇺🇸
No way, prices are getting silly
Here come all the people taken up for disney
If they were still alive, I would be guessing my parents would have been elated with the Disneyland prices 63 years ago.
I think his daily cost was my total trip cost to Universal Orlando and I was there 3 days
Disney sit up and listen , you money grabbing guttersnipes , giving the Sussex family a free holiday all the money they have by creaming it of charities , you could have had a family advertising for you that couldn't ordinarily afford to go there , can you imagine the excitement on their faces and what they would say about Disney , you ,issed and opportunity there .
$1,400 is two weeks of my pay BEFORE taxes. If Walt Disney were alive today, he would be appalled an outraged at what his company has become. The sky-high prices alone would trigger an aneurysm. Walt intended for Disney to be a place where everyone could afford to go. All that has been tossed into the crapper in the name of greed.
U can go to another country instead.
Did he get mad enough to return in a frog suit 😂😂😂
GROW UP! It's time to live in the real world, adults!
f..k Disney the woke expensive hell its become
Boycott Disney and the crazy wacko left park/company.
yes i spent 8000 hard rock  2017 4  days suites 7 th fl 7107 and 7111
Boycott Walt Disney you can get a better deal and more wholesome entertainment at Dolly world great America Seaworld Disney is overrated sexual theme park
I hope it is not misunderstood that the vast majority of Americans do not have this poor mentality It is very sad that the media promotes this example as something laughable and shameful😢
It's a ripp off.
I will never go to Disneyland. I just don't see the value in it.
Don't feel sorry for people who go to a place that supports woke crap. Of course they are going to rob you😂😂😂😂
"Pinch pennies"?!!! Going to Disney is NOT the way to "pinch pennies."
A couple points. Number 1, Disney is a ripoff, . Number2, Disney is “woke”, pushes the far far left agenda. Either that alone I will never go there.
Disney needs to build another Disneyland in another US state.
Thats why you go to McDonald's before you go to disney and go to a taco bell after disney
i’m tired of this company
What a waste.....take em to a car show or a hike ....
Back in 1987 I thought $19.99 was so expensive lol .  I was 15 .  Today prices , forget about it 😢
It’s overpriced anyway.
Well u can thank your orange man u voted for😂
Like everything else. U can't afford anything these days  and jobs don't pay enough unless your a entertainer.
Just go to the park or forest its cheaper besides Disney is of the devil
Did them all in the early 2000 s last straw was Lego land ,so many memories so much money and traffic parking 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Florida tourism is dead
I've lived in florida since 1971 , we used to do disney every year for birthdays... have not been able to afford to go or justify the spending of the money last five years... such a shame it has come to this... I've taken my grandkids 3 times in the last 8 years.Can't do it anymore disney sorry
That is over the top!
Disney where all the peodophiles are
Disney will always be costly. They are unlikely to reduce their prices, regardless of how many individuals voice their grievances on YouTube, TikTok, or any other social media platform. Typically, Disney is not intended to be a spontaneous destination unless you are affluent or are an annual pass holder. All the Disney parks in the world are the kind of places where you anticipate high expenses, so you need to save for several months in advance to ensure that you and your family can fully enjoy everything, including being ready to cover all the additional costs.
I know they need to make money but I just went there with my daughter and grand kids man what ashame they don’t give the parents a break, it’s crowded,hot and lines were so long and they even charge the parents a couple hundred bucks for a stroller not thinking give the stroller to the parents to keep them in the park ,20 bucks for a set of Mickey ears ,they could give little things like that to the kids, man give the parents a break, everyone I know said they would never go back, they go to local parks like Hersey, I talked to one parent and he said he saved for years to take his kids and they had to leave early because he was broke
I don't "DO" amusement parks
He's just being dumb. I've done a whole week Disney trip cheaper than that.  Stay in Kissimmee, eat your own food, by the way, you can bring your own food and drinks into the theme parks. And don't splurge; there are many ways to save money and give your kids the memories they will cherish all their lives. .Heck they're only kids once. Also, theres ways around the parking fee.
The name Disney is now synonymous with RIP OFF.  There is nothing at Disney that is a good value any more.  Rip Off.  Rip Off.
Boycott all entertainment in America and watch prices drop I guarantee.
It's how they pay people like Jimmy Kimmel..
Disneyland  /  Disney World  are special places. It's something you plan and save up for. There are many great amusement parks throughout the country but Disney is the best.
Just say no to Disney world Don't waste your money go see the Grand canyon Yellowstone etc much more entertaining Penny's on the dollar to go see
I recognized from his YouTube cannel.  I would prefer to of hiking in a national forest for free.
The Woke World of Disney is a trip to price gouging.
I wouldn't go just for that reason. GREED
Then stop going to that Woke park go somewhere else
That's why i took the tour to Tennessee on water falls and mountains..my kids loved it.
They have to make up the revenue losses from Kimmel and the live action Snow White somehow.
What kind of parent submits his kids  to LGBQT+ Woke corporate culture?      Real Americans won’t go to Disney.
He knew the cost before he went , if your concerned about the cost , then you probably shouldn't be there to begin with.
YAH ... LET'S BAN DW ..
Bro that was fair price for family of 5 why you complaining have less kids then.
Disneyland could have done a lot of different things to make things more attractive including passing out occasional half price tickets a trip to Disney has been unreasonable for a long time and employment there is a terrible experience now and has been for some time but the CEO wants to come up with different things that might benefit them or make them a profit in the meantime the CEO gets more and more money every year all while the business of Disney goes to trash
Do you know that… Christmas to see Santa at Disney,,,, Santa is DJT & the kids need to spend unaccompanied time with a bottle of baby oil for  3/4 hour in his company now & it’s a  500 dollar tariff for the privilege.
Universal is much better and not near the walking.
And most of the food is terrible.
I'M ONE OF 9 SIBLINGS WHO GREW UP IN THE 80'S AND NOT ONCE DID ANY OF US EVER ASK OUR PARENTS IF WE COULD GO TO DISNEY!!! WE PLAYED BALL, GYMNASTICS, PICNICS, WENT TO CITY POOL AND ATE PIZZA ON THE WEEKENDS...WE HAD NO DESIRE TO GO TO PLACES LIKE THAT. THE ONLY TRIPS WE EVER TOOK WERE SCHOOL TRIPS TO CEDAR POINT. DAD USE TO SIT IN A CHAIR WITH THE HOSE SPRAYING UP OVER THE STREETAND EVEN PEOPLE DRIVING BY WANTED TO GET SPRAYED!!! OUR "DATES" DIDN'T TAKE US TO RESTAURANTS,  WE SNEAK OUT AND MEET THEM DOWN THE RD FOR A FEW MINUTES....IT WAS ENOUGH AND I MISSED OUT ON NOTHING LIKE THIS ROBBERY 😂😂
Unbelievable...costs and long lines. I am never going to visit Disney
I love fox 😂 “can’t afford groceries under the last administration”
Why is this news? Nice family but I don’t get it when news channels do this.
Crazy friends decided to go to Vegas, prices are outrageous 😲 everything is too expensive,food, Starbucks. PARKING /hotels charge you for parking on there  property 🤬 what's next they're going to charge us for oxygen. My friends say never again, they're never going back to Vegas. Maybe we all should stay away from places like this. Disneyland, New York, Las Vegas.  Stay away, visit national parks, go fishing, take your kids to the beach 🏖️ Try to do something fun near your home.🙂 Good luck 🍀with this economy everyone.
Could had a jet2 holiday.
More money than brains. Who can afford that????
Did she say that things got easier under this administration?  What world is she living in.   A little unknown truth about Disney, many of the employees are interns that don't get paid, they get a place to live and food.  Its a voluntary position.
To many creepy Disney adults imo won’t take my kids
Disney world is overrated.
We don’t care
That ain’t right!
People Pay It !!!! If you can’t afford it you don’t get to go …
You can take your family to the real Grand Canyon for way less money and stress. The grandeur of the real thing will blow away the 1 minute grand canyon train ride you had to wait in line for.
Maybe security became too expensive. I helped Disney World before when it came to security but it's not everyday you find me in someone's body.
If people will pay 10/20 dollars for a bottle of juice to keep their kids happy.  Imagine what they will spend to take them to Disney Land.
Rich people don't go to Disneyland
Thats just how it is. Instead of being the friendliest place on earth.  its the most expensive
Shouldn't be a shock, it's Disney. They've been like this for a long time. This is capitalism people.
I don’t care if you thought it was too expensive. If you didn’t know what it was going to cost before you went there,  you’re an idiot! Stay home.
Disney don't care about families, but do want your money. Very sad very sad.😢
I will not spend a penny on a company that represents “woke “culture. And I have a lot to give. 😊
I’ve just been for 2 weeks from the uk. Total cost including everything  just under 20 thousand dollars. That was for 3 of us.
Don’t go to the theme parks if you don’t want to spend the money? It’s ridiculously expensive. Dude wasn’t even trying to be frugal. He’s the one that chose to keep swiping his card… as he’s wearing Minnie Mouse ears.  Bring your own food and a refillable water bottle.   You don’t HAVE to buy Lightning Passes.   You can buy tickets to one park and not pay for park hopper. It’s cheaper.   $119 tickets for Hollywood studios.  If you bring your own food then your only other expense would be parking.   If you have to fly there and pay for a hotel then…. Expect to pay $10,000 lol
Go to Disneyland Tokyo. Much cheaper and better  than in USA
Don't have a family. Problem solved.
An you ride maybe one ride or two rides if you’re early enough universal is no different lived here my whole life, I use to ride rides 6 or 7 times at island of adventures now you can’t ride one two times because that’s half the day done by just waiting in line.  I hate it for out of state people they just spend thousands on hotels and food Jesus
$1400 is almost the same as $1600 for an incredipass for one person, the best annual pass w free parking, free admission, and discounts XD
This is why I use an annual pass for disney. Free parking, free admission, and 10% off sit down restaurants. So if bill is 200$, you actually pay 180$. Not a lot, but it adds up. Incredipass may be $1600 per person, but when going to disney a lot, it pays for itself, and then some.
Honestly i go every year from scotland for 2 weeks and dont find it expensive.but when i go to sea world i see that as mega expensive 😮
The simple things. I guess at home it's too easy for everyone to shut themselves off in their own digital world so waiting in line was a way for everyone to be together and talking.
Your wife right? I guess she doesn't give a F about prices
Why play with Disney when you can play with Disnutz
My 20 year old said he doesn’t remember our trip to Disney when he was three. I whipped out pictures and went to bed 🤣🤣😭.
2:22 good save 😂
Stop going ! Instead go to national parks or historic places. They are plenty and truly gems. These theme parks are ridiculous and fake and worst never maintained
It's a magical place.😂
I take my daughter to the neighborhood hood park. Absolutely free and Absolutely memorable every time
They need to go to Dollywood, I heard it is cheaper and a lot of fun .
Horrible. What are their profits?
RIP off
Disney is another elite greedy company.  God Bless America
We don't go anymore and we live 65 miles from the park. It's a cash cow the thing that Walt never wanted the park to become they should not even use his name anymore it's the worst.
2:19  girl you know it’s gotten worse 😒
They pay 98 million a year in property tax a year just for starters! You would think the news would have supplied that info on this article ha.
Disney World is for a once-a-year thing and for others a once in a lifetime thing. Not meant for to go every week. Spend time at beaches and parks like everybody else ha.
I have no issue with the price of the ticket because the maintenance of the park and the staff would cost a lot. I also understand the crowds. Think about it, people from halfway around the world could be visiting the same day you were there. However, the lightening pass, I think, was a greedy business tactic: you pay extra to get that privilege. When people get fed up with long lines and start to purchase the lightening pass, then there could be a line for the lightening pass people to get on some popular rides. What would Disney do next? Implement a “Super Lightening Pass” for people who could pay “extra” extra? People who couldn’t afford the lightening privilege will then have to pay with their precious “time” to wait in long lines. It’s the happiest place in the world, but it’s not that much of a fair place, unfortunately. Disney should allow reservations for the rides, so people only need to show up when it’s time for their rides and could explore the park while waiting for their rides. This will maximize the Disney experience and create more happy memories. Every single minute spent in Disneyland should be a happy memory instead of memories about waiting in line. Mr. I, I read your book, fine leadership, but the park visitors deserve to be taken good care of, too.
I thought Ron de Santis can afford Disney 😂😂
1400 for  1 day is outrageous.  That's rent for month
Paying just for a parking spot at a azumement park is pure bs. I hate disney do much
I’m not in shock honestly it cost over 200 for a family of 5 to go to Apple bees we go to Disneyland all the time we pay the same amount to eat at Disneyland than what I spend in fast food. It does not cost $400 for lighting lane this is dumb lol
California Disney is no better. Have'nt been since 2000, but even then it was way over priced. Friend of mine went in 2019, it was 1500 a day for 4 people, they made 6 rides and ate lunch and dinner there.
Wow!!!! $400 for lightning passes. These Disney trips are expensive.
Send in more troops to distract Meanwhile Bloomberg emails have Epstein telling Maxwell in 2008 "to take Trump off everything"  LOOK IT UP!!!
😂bro stop crying and spend your money 💴 Disney will coast you go to Mc d you’ll spend 20 on one meal. 🍽️
Stop going there . Stop going back . As long as you pay , they'll charge endlessly and forever to the hilt . Don't go there . Vegas too . Cost too much - don't go . Loads of people still go and pay the max , which means they will still be charged the most possible by Disney . As long as you keep going and keep paying willingly through the nose the cost will remain very high .
I’ll just stick to Kingdom Hearts, thanks.
The price of park tickets are super high. I've been twice when my daughter was 5 and again at age 8.
A woke wonderland
Lol, I've been there numerous times and never touched that much. Everybody doesn't need to be in every over the top hotels......
That’s why I quit going.
I would never go at those prices , not worth spending all that money
If this keeps up people are not going to this place anymore.
Been there done that! Had enough of it. Moving on.
Yes, it's really out of hand.   I took my children to Disney in Orlando at least a dozen times, then, I took my grandchildren.  It is NOT nearly as nice as it used to be and it certainly is not affordable.   Disney needs to come back down to earth.
Stealing
Meanwhile I can’t afford $1,800 for 2 dental crowns that I desperately need 🤦🏻.
So stop going, problem solved!!
And Epstein?
Because going to Disney is not for the poor it’s for the rich just the emission just to get into the park is extraordinarily expensive than everything else that you have to buy so there you go I would never go to Disney because they’re just too expensive. There’s other things that you can do that are not that expensive like there’s museums there’s parks there’s zoos that you can go to and other things then to just give your money to a park that doesn’t care about you whatsoever
Should have went during covid
I can get a balcony on a 7 day cruise for around $2200. Way better deal
Fools and their money are easily parted 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The stupid comment about people not affording groceries under the prior administration! 😂  Typical FOX to make this about politics.  Price of groceries are still the same in my area.
Too many kids
Shut up and AND PAY IT. What are major corporations and big business supposed to have sympathy for you ?? And lower their profits.Because of you.Get a life get another job or don't go
stop u winine want some cheese with that wine? should have went in the 1970s and got it out of ya system u stupid for payin it just like mac donalds wants 12 buks for a fish value meal now
Wake up people, stop falling into the trap
Oh boo. You made that choice.
Disney future.. BANKRUPTCY .🤷‍♀️
If you keep paying their prices, then they will keep charging them.  Find something cheaper for your family to do.  There are lots of  places to go.  don't be afraid to tell you kids you can't afford something.  Kids need to learn early that money is going to  make a lot of  their life decisions for them.
Disney been expensive for decades this is not a day park
The fattest get a lifetime membership it don't apply to them because they're a piece of s***
He didn't got it, the magic is how your money disappears!
It's why numbers are down at Disney and Vegas
The parks are the only thing keeping them in biz the company is a failing joke at this point
You spent $80 on a minny hat and expect us to gasp at the exorbitant price of Disney?  You, the discerning market expert has been swindled over more than the thousand give or so dollars for FIVE PEOPLE’S FULL DAY ENTRY TO DISNEYFUCKINGLAND, but you test the waters of credulity by ensuring that your base is
Not a snowballs chance in hell would I ever go there!
Cheaper to take a 7 day cruise
“It’s difficult to afford with the last administration”. Let’s be honest, it still sucks under Trump. This better improve soon or people will be unhappy.
Disney has never been cheap.
My stupid brother spent 10k on a week long Disney vacation. That’s probably why he declared bankruptcy twice and orders a pizza delivery with a credit card.
And that's for a resident... imagine out of towners 😂
I'm staying home
That's a lot now imagine paying for one disney hotel and visiting every park in disney and universal without mentioning the flights tickets to return to our contry and also we need to save money for the premium outlets it is crazy, we need to save money for years to make this dream real.
Your kids happiness doesn’t have a price.
Make America great again 😂
Tried to do the same thing, but at universal. If you stay at their top-tier hotel, you get fast passes included for the day of check-in and for the day of check out. So family of 3 one night at the hotel and three tickets was around $2800. This of course is not including a plane ticket to get to Florida etc. etc. etc..
That's the way I feel when I have to buy a new cell phone
Respectfully, here’s a better way to make good profit with your park: don’t f - ck with your biggest hit rides!
Absolutely diabolical, ticket prices should be half of what they are.
F disney they have been ripping families off for years. Everyone should stop going until they cut prices in half.
2:21 Under the last administration?
It’s like paying $500 for a giant gift for Christmas and then the kid ends up playing more with the box… 😂
We did Disney MK 1 day and spent $590 for the 4 of us 2 kids 2 adults tickets we brought food and drinks in a backpack cooler saved a lot
This guy is a car dealership owner. Still he feels it is very expensive.
I wish my trip only cost $1,400 to go to Disneyland or Disney world😂
Disney pricing model:   "Charge them up the A@@ and they will come"
Most people don't end up in the news because they do research before going to Disney
First mistake was spending the money in Florida. Could’ve went to a national park for half that and saw more.
If why tf did I have kids was a person 😂 it'll be him, Dad,taking the kids on a day trip to Disney 🌍 😂 @15sec-20secs 😂. @ the restaurant 😂
Get there.  Stay at decent hotel or motel.  Buy the ticket.  Go in and enjoy.  Leave .  Bank account still happy.
Honestly never been there but I feel it's just hyped up??
Disney is expensive. Its a brand. You dont buy a lambo and then get "shocked" by how much spent.  Idiots. Fox news again hating
I watched this and i live in the 🇬🇧 , i last went there over 17yrs ago (with my kids now 28/25 but cant remember how old they was then) so it be definatley out the price range now if wanted to go.
People keep paying ridiculous prices. More power to Disney. Good job, keep supporting the greed. They'll have all your hard earned money in no time. 😅
First three words when you're met at Disney ticket gate getting greeted by Mickey: "Stick 'em up mann!" And remember their theme song: Who's the leader of the gang that robbed both you and me? M I C K E Y, M O U S E!
what a terrible vacation…
Dad simp
Elephant in the room - want to bet the gal interviewing the guy could afford it? Probably without even blinking. This world is so full of irony.
stop going.  as long as people pay they will keep raising the prices higher every year.
What a sweet kid, that says a lot about her parents.
Hurt the executives where it hurts,in the pocket.The workers get eff all .Boycott good people.
It's only expensive if you partake. Who coined the phrase, "a fool and his money are soon parted"?
it is a little bit cheaper to go online to get tickets (than at the door, even if it is within a week or a month) and yes they have the Florida residence discount too. but in comparison to prices it cost me around $800 for 1 week Disney World and Universal in 2012 (1 person), now I'm  guessing about $4,000 for this year. (2025) and I could probably never afford the fast pass price.
We went to the parks every year until the end of 2017, more Universal than Disney, spending 3 to 4 days. Our kids enjoyed it until they asked not to go anymore. It was never cheap yet within reason, including the lines. Nowadays wouldn’t even go if I was paid, let alone for these prices.
As long you are happy
The Rocky Mountains, Grand Canyon, Arches National Park, Mount Rushmore.  Absolutely beautiful places.
They coming over from the UK 😢
I holiday to Florida twice a year, from the UK. I notice that Americans seem to love gimmicks. For instance, Disney Springs, Gideon’s Bake house cookies are disgusting, and everyone I speak to thinks the same, but yet everyone queues (Gets in line) to buy them. If you hype something up, and charge a fortune for it, American will pay it. Nothing against you guys love you ,as your the most positive, outgoing nation in the world, but I think it has its downfalls with certain things.
Seriously though. Go somewhere like Santa's Village or Jay Peak.
Valid Dad Crashout
Nobody forced you
Well you Floridians voted for this😅
Don’t go there. Not worth it. The day is over when you wait on the line for a couple of rides
F DLand bro!!! i pee’d in Mickeys mouses mouth
It's all about the money, parent's need to stop, just stop and set realistic travel goals....so sad that those places literally bankrupt parents,,but if the parent's aren't parenting and they are making asinine choices, then Disney squeeze them even more charge 2k a day...
Walt Disney is pop Corning in his casket
I would never,,,people need to stop going to those places and the soda pop fees,,Parents need to stop contributing to the delinquency of their minors or themselves...just stop,,
Lastly, do yall not understand, if Disney lowered there prices, the PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN FLORIDA WILL GO ALL THE TIME. And if you travel here, you wont be able to just pick a date in any near future ( bc it will be so packed non stop ) That you will have to wait 2 years down the road to go.
News keeps using that word " Shock "  same word I used all my life due to having PTSD.  So is USA and its gov officials CREATING ptsd in everybody lol  bc EVERYTHING TODAY WHERE EVER YOU GO, IS CAUSING YOU SHOCK.

B3cause of the tsrrifs dude, everything is sky high.
The Price of FAKE magic
Is it worth it
Ripping off families ! Overpriced greedy business just like many others.
rip off. when disney has no visitors, they will have to figure that out. greedy af.
i wonder if theres any way for disney to evetulaly bring the prices down, or is ti just goingt o keep getting worse, how much more can we afford, weve already popped the bubbe, bet wills till go cause we want to make our kids and our inner child happy lol, but its terribly damaging
974 for a family of 5 ain’t bad when you from Cali
Tax Disney and give some tax return to the people who have gone to Disney
Disney ain’t getting a penny from me. Maybe modern penny, but not the copper penny.
This is some hunger games acting type stuff
All that money just to feel hot as hell and wait in lines for long periods. Disney sucks!
Honestly I spent 2000 at for my Disney trip with 2 days and a hotel and that’s with my tickets …. You have to be smart or they will gouge you
You don’t really need to spend all the money to different theme. Park to have fun. Spending time with your family especially kids is the biggest reward. Any human being can have. But this is definitely a great story thank you Fox for that.
Disneyland greed.
Boycotting may be the answer ❤
Disneyland's cost have BEEN out of control for some time now!! A trip to the amusement park shouldn't cost the same as a MORTGAGE!! 🤨🤔👎🚩
It's a hell hole run by paedos.
Left in shock how much you thought it was Disney not six flags
he complains about the cost and yet spends it anyway. It is not a necessity. price is based mostly on demand.
Take your kids to Florida and catch something from the trash kids that live there - NO vaccines now in Florida!!!!!!
I stopped going there a couple of years before covid, it is NOT worth even half of what you pay. Bring down the price 75% and maybe people will go back. I'm done with Disney, i even refuse to pay for Disney+
It’s Disney.  The prices are posted.  Why are you surprised?
😂😂 it was 5 of them. What did he think. SMH I tell you.
I’ve been to Disney world twice it’s not worth it after walking miles to get in and around the park I spent most of time waiting in lines HOURS park hopper pass is a joke bc u can barely do one park in one day much less two and the food is not good the snacks are good but the actually food/meals is not good it’s like hospital food the hotel we stayed in was a basic old style hotel room w Mickey painted on furniture idk I think it’s a RIP OFF
It’s Disneyland what’d you expect?
That vacation was more like $1,800 because you've got to pay uncle same around 22% taxes on your income before you have $1,400 to spend on a disney trip. Sorry to be a Debbie Downer, but the truth hurts.
That’s insane Disney smh
Some parents go and don’t bring their kids… so sad what this has become.
He chose to wear them ears and she said nal.  🤔
I been to it as a kid in California. And I’m 37. But I thought that was about average cost.
Last time I went there was in 1990 with my wife and it was $50 for both of us for the day!
Greedy America!!.. made in china souvenirs..probably owned by a Chinese firm..
Disneyland leads to two things, an empty wallet for an overpriced turkey leg that gives you a belly ache, and ultimately back to the parking lot!
I thought DisneyWorld was so worth it.  Actually cheap.  What’s the PROBLEM?  Signed, Crypto Man (White House).    Hahaha suckers
I would take my niece there for sure. For a*household of 5 it's expensive, but i would go on a family trip where everyone covers their own ticket, split the parking, food etc.
Liked the comment, “the last administration” jab.  I am so with you.  He is a good Christian too.  Which makes me feel better.  Crypto currency gig?  Rapist of 8 year olds?  Epstein lists?  Everyone is so into the negative.  But I’m with him any which way.  Go Epstein forever.
Dude is a dumbass for spending that much, EVERYONE knows disney is WAY over priced and that along with them messing the parks up are the reasons why the parks are empty. Also note the youtube plaque on his wall? Another influencer trying to get his viral shot.
Disney theme parks are not that great either
This is the price of preventing Disney parks from becoming ghetto Carnival cruises.
Take a weekend cruise(food, fun, entertainment) included
We bring our own meals and drinks in a cooler. Cooling towels help a lot.
All things Disney sucks almost as bad as government.
Sad how Walt Disney World has become an expensive construction site to visit with many attractions gone or out order 😢
The sad part is that everyone pays for it, if no one decided to go to give them a lesson to lower their prices….
That is F-ing insane! No, things money wise has Not gotten a little better, maybe for you but it hasn’t for anyone I know…
White dad at ticket booth: It's the greatest place on Earth!  Here, take my wallet and give me back how much you think I should have. Black dad at ticket booth: $32.50 to get up in this mothaf*cka?!    -- Damon Wayans, 1997
I live in FL about an hour and 40 minute drive to Disney. 1 ticket for an adult to the magic kingdom nearly 200 dollars chances are you'll only get 2 ride at least 4 to 5 rides.
The reason the prices are getting higher is because of the DEI Bob Igor keeps pushing which causes losses in films released. They have literally lost billions in films and if you didn't know the films support the parks. So blame the clown CEO
WOW WHO IS STILL SUPPORTING WOKE LIBERAL DISNEY?? U GET WHAT U DESERVE IF U STILL SUPPORT DISNEY  TRAITORS WOKE  F DISNEY STUPID PARENTS TAKE THEIR KIDS TO THIS WOKE CRAP
I dont like disney, but right now they have 3 days for 300, theres a decent rosen inn in orlando thats 50-65 a day, Uber is 20-30, food can be cheaper in multiple ways. Learn to live within your means, and learn to say no.
I lived in Florida for 7 years..  paying rent would never allow me to save to go to Disney… I’ve always said we can have even more fun paying less somewhere affordable.. we moved to another state .. we always went to water parks which was 12$ per person all day.. we would go skating go to the lake … go to parks.. go to carnivals that would come twice a year.. get on rides .. we have so many memories.. I still can’t afford to go to Disney… but we have soo many fun memories without having to spend soo much money… those places most your day is being in long lines.. and be exhausted..
Disney is a luxury, it’s not rent or mortgage or fuel or groceries. This is very unfortunate but it’s not a real need . If you can afford his luxury plan and save and enjoy your trip. But a cruise ship or flying to New York will cost. Vacations at expensive and Disney is in the upper range on the vacation spectrum. Don’t really know what the point of this report was????
kendall did ya have fun what was your favorite part ? 'when my daddy broke down crying over his wallet' and mickey danced around him screaming pay up stupid '
Well dad, her comment at the end was absolutely priceless 🥰
I wouldn’t ever take my children or grandchildren now I wouldn’t take a step into USA even for a drink
I went to Disney when it was affordable me and 5 other family members back in 81
Dad should have researched AND set a budget
I love how this tool and the media are telling us something everyone already knew..But he still proceeds to spend the money and act like a victim.Then Ainsley Earhardt whos worth millions gets everyone all fired up like she can relate to the average family.
Word to the Wise. Surviving is Not Living. And if Your Just Surviving, Surviving for What? The Cost of Simply Surviving has Become Excessively  Beyond Reason. To All Those Out There Who have Given FAR Beyond what They have Been Given, I Feel for You. Godbless You All. 🙏❤️
Now add in hotel stays and flights for out of state visitors
But at least you got to see some diversity 🤣🤣
I used to love going in mid 90s/early 2000s. My favorite part was getting a new pair of Nikes at Florida Nike outlet mall. Guess not anymore..
BOYCOTT!!! BOYCOTT!!! BOYCOTT!!!
Can we please start a gofundme for this poor white family?
How did he get the entire day for 5 for 1400? Something seems off, it cost way more than that typically
we wont ever go back
You dont need to waste so much money to have a good time be smart dont be this family
Wait did she just say the cost of living has gotten a little bit better!?!? 😂😂
$5000 for me as outsider of florida
Yup! Another Disney Disaster!
When I was a kid in 2005, My parents took me my brother and my sister to Disney has children for one week and we stayed in the campgrounds at Disney in Florida. It was about $1,500 for all five of us to go for one week and stay at the campgrounds, and that was the only time we went because even that was pricey I can't even imagine now
Even the daughter knows that man is a goofy the way she nods in the beginning of the interview straight disappointment.
Even Disneyland is ridiculous. It’s been about 12 years since I last went and it’s literally a couple blocks away. I’d rather book a solo trip
They could of went to Applebees if they wanted to talk 😂
Go on a 4-5 day cruise vs going to Disney..
We packed lunches and snacks. We only ate once at the park which was our plan. Otherwise eating alone for a family of 5 is hundreds of dollars.
My granddaughter is a  autistic line. With freak me out the lines and the crowd
"Can't afford their groceries or gasoline, at least that was under the last administration" - she really said that?  Talk about taking deep draughts of Trumps CoolAid. Disney is a total rip off.  If you can manage to get on two rides for the day, you'd be lucky.
Disneyland is no longer for the middle class as it continues to shrink, they are gearing for the upper 10% of income households. So pitch a tent in the backyard and let your kids have fun.
I’m lucky I grew up in south Florida. Born 1973 and got to go there every year. Every October was the time to go, zero lines or waiting. It was SO affordable then. I cant afford to bring my kids. It’s ridiculous.
Fox, this is friendly fire!
And people keep paying it so why would they drop their prices?? How about stop going and you’ll save a ton of money..
I took my kids and it was very expensive but they loved it. For a lot of us, it's a once in a lifetime experience and a point of pride as a father to be able to take my family there. I'm not complaining.
Bruh you guys a family of FIVE. Everything is going to eat you alive
You couldn't get her to wear the hat but she should had.
This is all of us...all of us with kids, grandkids etc...
Did this man just pop out of the womb? This has been known for decades now.
Crappiest Place on Earth.
That’s $280 per person…. It’s expensive but it’s not that expensive given the costs associated with running a theme park.
Only fools with no education or common sense would go to Disney! They’re laughing at you all the way to the bank and just LOVE idiots.
It’s the American dream of enriching the wealthy!
No, + you're supporting Fink's DEI woke platform
The comment about the previous admin was ridiculous … so unnecessary and just also wrong?
Disney is a PDF dump
Americans are hard-working people, loves to party and to merry-make during holidays, special occasions and birthdays.
Nobody told him to have kids. 🤷🏻‍♀️
830 for 2 adults for 2 days 😅 is insane
Well go live in the woods then
Not only did we have inflation last 8 months, the rate of inflation  has also increased. I don’t know how people who couldn’t afford groceries and rent last administration suddenly can but them cheaper. Cost will continue to go up much more as we will need to print money,  devaluating our dollar to pay for our increasing US debt.  As far as the dad being sticker shocked, he is a moron for taking his family to Disney. He could have added up cost before going.  If he really wants to go to Disney with the family, buy the pixie pass for Florida residents. Included parking, discounts at Disney and even at Disney springs. 3 trips to Disney and the annual pass pays for itself.
Back in 2017 my ticket was $75 for an all day pass??? Tf is Disney doing? Money laundering scheme?
Just the cost of water alone is insane
Disgusting prices….Disney, Vegas, beach house rentals, groceries, etc. Good thing our president has us pay for his golf trips, MaraLago trips, WH ballroom renovation, so he doesn’t have to worry.
Is this a joke! This is not news worthy you choose to go to Disney that’s your problem you know the prices prior!!!!! This is so he can get clicks I can’t believe how stupid this is!
This is all Joe Biden's fault, amirite?
Disney is not worth it. No thanks. So many other things more worth the spend.
They don’t want ghetto broke folks going. It’s bad for business😂
Insanely, sadly ridiculous that sooo many families will never have this as an option to do. 😢
It was so bad he called the news lmao 🤣😂
If people just stop buying their stuff they WILL drop the prices once they realize they’re getting closer to bankrupt.
Get the kids' passports and take them to an all-inclusive resort 🌴😎.
Disney scamming people nothing new here
Id NEVER go to Disney World !!!! What a rip off !!!!😮😮😮
PHUK FLORIDA
GREED Reigns Supreme at Disney. Mickey and the Woke clowns racking in the $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Disney is not worth the cost or the crowdedness aggravation.  Not only should Disney lower costs a lot, but limit the amount of people in the park, by reservation.
Who is our current president? 🍊🫏 💩
The park is not to blame, people is for being so obsessed to go there no matter what.
I mean, he has 5 children. Of course it wouldn’t be cheap.
If there are Long  lines Disney is doing well so why would they even care who can afford it
Disney needs to do better by the Florida resident
So what’s the attraction?
I spent 2 weeks in Disney I think the total was $8k.  That's one week in Pirates of the caribean lodge and one week in the Animal Kingdom lodge a two week food pass for a family of 4.
Dude lives in Fl...he should know better...plus he could have researched beforehand...idiot
Fox with the hard hitting news stories f’ing stupid idiots lol it’s inflation and Trump is president it’s his fault right? No it’s only inflation and it’s only the presidents fault when it’s a democrat. Go eat rocks all of you.
i am speechless...  $1400 to entertain a family of 5 and feed them in disney...  you call that expensive?  may be the dad should work harder so he can earn more money?
For the same reasons I quit going to Disney!  It’s just not worth it!!  The cost!  the crowds!  😡NOT any more!!
This rules out my Wife's dream of returning to Disneyland. Kind of soul crushing.
Groceries are less expensive now 😂
0:38 was that a fart?
… They bought tickets at the window without a deal? That’s on him 100%.
The price of food has not gone down it’s gone up!
You can tell this man just cares about money which is so sad. I know this bc the little girl corrected herself and said “it’s packed despite what we spent, well he spent.” So the dad makes it clear that the money is his and what a xxxxx
Just go to Six Flags for the rides most of these kids nowadays don’t even watch Disney anymore they watch Brazilian Brainrot, Roblox or KPOP Demon Hunters
People can’t afford it but still go lol it’s like an addiction for some
The target audience is not family and kids anymore.. 67% of Disney park visitors are households with no  KIDS!
This while CNN and Fox news anchors make 10+ million a year. Just because we watch them shove their propaganda in our brains
It's time to say goodbye to Disney World. From outrageous ticket prices, low employee wages, and abandoning wholesome values and the childlike wonder of Disney's vision,  so long.
Dear Fox News, everything in the economy is more expensive now than it was under the last administration. Also the unemployment rate right now is higher as well. So please tell me why your dumb reporter turned this into something political while also being inaccurate? We get it yall don't like a certain group of politicians but that shouldn't lead you to bending the news or lying about the truth.
Imagine being white and complaining about prices lol..buddy had a headstart in life tf you mean.
Disney is too woke recently - so we went on cruise & save a lot!
Bros too late, we all been saying this
You have to go with a broken leg, then you can skip all the lines.
It has NOT gotten better😂😂😂
I'm not sure where people are getting the money to go to Disney
And you’re going to be on a ride for about 2 minutes
Economic 101 - supply and demand - if you pay they will increase the price. Once you stop paying they will have no choice but to reduce the price.
That's a man, confident in his masculinity, not afraid to wear those ears. You ROCK!
Glad my mom took us back in the early 2000s.😅
lol for most of the world is expensive since forever because guess what… different currencies LOL. So many families see it like a goal of a dream for their children. Welcome to world reality.
Who paid
Just knowing the fact that he was a YouTuber he did it for the likes he only was standing in front if his plaque during the recording
Yikes😅
1400 dollars > 1 day..............HELL NO! I don't get it, when it's that expensive, why would one even go ?!
Yes, it is extremely expensive. 2 years ago, we went to Disney  for a week. We are family of 6. Mom, dad, and 4 kids. We spent about 15k. It was a one in a lifetime trip. I'm still paying for the loan we took out for that trip.
Who would’ve thought 4 kids would be expensive 🤷‍♂️
Look, if you can’t afford it, then don’t go. 5 kids was your first mistake. Maybe keep it in your pants next time.
He chose the right daughter for the interview 😂❤️
don't feel bad little girl...i'm sure she is confused about the cost. it's worth it to your family for one day of a moment together.🩷
Inflation is out of control.  And I have in-laws wanting to come here to my home and they expect us to feed them, ride them around sightseeing, buy all their tickets, etc.  All for FREE.  Can't do it anymore.  I can barely pay my bills let alone pay for other people's vacations.
It sounds like a great plan, but I've never been to California, Orlando, or Disney World.  Still, I usually like to base my vacation plans on where I can have the most fun. Yes, Disney can be quite pricey.  They have some nice low-tech items, but that's just too much money for what they have no upgrades  Star Wars is revolutionary. 🤗  How about trying something new instead? decent price that takes into account the park's worth, not our personal budget.
Family friendly? Have you seen the Disney fight videos ? LMFAO
Yeah and you know what? The parks are still full beyond capacity, you spend hours in lines and overcrowded... All this people keep paying that... If anything, it's going to get even MORE expensive..
Parents realize they don’t have to take their kids to Disney right? There’s a way better resort in Central Florida anyway and it’s called Universal Studios.
When I was a kid it cost 50 cents to get into Disneyland😮
Walk along the ocean or a beautiful park. Spend 80$ for lunch and you've had a great day.
$1400 for the day… was it worth it?  Yea.   Ok that’s how much it costs.
Imagine fox news showing a feature about a dad who is complaining about the rising costs of entertainment but fox doesn’t shine light on the rising costs of products, tariffs, job layoff, and loss of the American dream. They pick and choose wisely don’t they.
you owe the central ban 36 trillion so much you cant ever pay it back but they still lend you money. look at the bright side you can still have a house a car food and so on. dont complain that you arent rich. if you wanted to be rich you should be a politician
It’s sad because young children will never experience Disney because it’s wayyyyyyy to expensive for the average American parent.
Spend  time with your kids. It doesn’t cost anything.
I have never been. My parents took my family (there are 6 of us total) to ocean city MD every summer when I was younger and I wouldn’t change this for anything. 😊
If I could afford to take a vacation it wouldn’t be to Disney that’s for sure!
I mean if you have a problem than why go?
Well I guess he could afford to have a kid 😂
You guys don’t have to go . Vacation is not a human right
How is this news lol
What is the difference between this video and another video that is Similar to this video..????
Do you blame Disney ? The lower poor class comes with certain behaviors ! It’s a behavior that can’t be explained ! Watch an episode of cops you will understand ! Its behaviors with a particular class of people that still has not moved on in over 300 years  vs snd never will ! Everyone can thank Lincoln !
WA WA WA WA. You have to pay to play - “ you wanna live white and live and act White . Pay White prices ! Why do u think it cost what it does ? They don’t want the lower class in there ! The Gins / Piñatas/ Jacksonville trailer park / Gainesville Trash  of Florida is not welcome !
It’s called the Trump economy. You wanted lower prices, right? Lol.
He not pinching pennies it’s a lie.  He knew Disney cost just clout
Well it was a family of 5.  What did you expect?
I bought Disney stock thinking I may as well make my money back, but I haven't seen my stock value go up or money coming back as dividends as much as the prices at the parks have gone up!!!
The prices at Univeral Studios increase too.  Better to just travel to other country theme parks at this point.
Womp Womp, jus afford it
It's expensive and yet still packed meaning ppl will pay any amount to go, and disney know this
Being a father is an L in today's society thank the lord I'm single and celibate Amen🙏
Some humble bragging going on here….while complaining about creating the opportunity to drop a grand then placing it on the internet for everyone to validate “ look how wonderful of a father I am for taking my kids to DL & I have the cash to drop a grand on a day of fun for them“. It is a little bit of an awareness thing for the public but heavily rolled in almost intangible showoffiness. I wouldn’t have put the ears on either if I was the kid lol Omg, at DW, the lineups with 2 kids was like a birth control commercial. Never again. And the cost has always been astronomical so that’s not news 😅
I’m left in shock that people still go.  Walt would be extremely disappointed at how it’s become a place for rich families, or families that carry 50K credit card debt.
Disney is ridiculous.
I thought Americans were all for capitalism now they're not?
Who doesn't research prices ahead of time?
Cool, release the Epstein files
Not worth the money and will never take my kids. Very expensive for the family not affordable    After paying the bills no money left for Disney
😂
alright she didnt appreciate disney so next time just stay at home and stay in line there 🤷🏽‍♂️
We visited NASA after Disney trip in Florida. NASA had better rides for kids trust me. Better experience!! My kids said so too.
It’s not worth going for a single day I would never it’s 3 days or more for me
You’re upset about spending $1400 for the day….?  Lightning lane is cheap as hell. This guy wants clicks. Every time we go to a park for our family of four we’re spending 2500 bucks.
Disney World and Vegas are both a waste of money, time, boring, dirty, and anything goes.
I Paid Almost 300$ Tron Lightning Pass..
I know this isnt the point but did that guy at the end say his name is bria n killme
I only got one daughter and I hope to keep it that way so I can afford Disneyland
On top of that the flights just to get there and hotel.
Don’t go to Disney land then? First world problems
Excuding fast pass
As a Florida resident myself I always enjoy going to the South Florida Fair when I was a kid more than Disney. the fair is huge it is and it's just packed with rides. I'm 40 now and those are some of the best memories I ever had. If you are a tourist visiting Florida between January and February it is an excellent idea to consider. It is full of exhibits and even has performances on different stages there in addition to the many many rides and booths for games and other activities including a petting zoo area. It is on a huge acre multi-acre piece of land and it is magical
Japan disney > usa disney
Strategy is to keep you spending
Yeah, it is like $4000 for 2 Disney adults for a couple days. But that includes hotel and airplane to get to Florida
Lighting passes aren’t even a thing anymore. At least in Disneyland
INCREASE THE VALUE OF THE DOLLAR TO WHAT IT USED TO BE Boycott. Make them notice an absence of customers
He probably didn’t even get to ride all the rides they intended to ride for their visit/money. Woooo that is some expensive day. Then you get tired asf walking that place the sweaty ride people sometimes… it’s not fun. I get in free year round and haven’t been since 2016.
I’m sorry, but if you’re dropping money like that, and were considering the lightning passes, the 45 dollar lightsaber isn’t being said no to cus he’s worry about an extra 45 dollars. LOL
She cooked them professionally 😞... The undertone was crazy 😅
That’s my rent
Could’ve taken them abroad for that price!!
No ,he will never forget it either. 😂
Literally cheaper to fly to Disney Japan and come back lol
I’m poor and I still go , no complaints 😅
Daughter beautiful 🩷
So ridiculous. Disneyland is not worth it.
What would Walt Disney himself think of that ?
They probably could have got a season pass for that price or now much more
Correct people need to stop going there, go to Busch Gardens!
Get yo paper up brokie
Expensive and overcrowded
Capitalism gonna capitalize.
Wait, did your wife pinch in with some of the expenses?
100 per person to park  100 per person to get in the park  100 per person for food   I would sayd its like 200- 250 over priced  But thats not really that expensive. Its a vacation place it seems about fare to me
at that moment he relized the 1400$ might have been worth it lol
And that is why we don't go. Because you are getting squeezed out. They let in too many people and you wait 2-3 hours in lines. It is just exhausting.
Califonia Disney is worse
Parking is $35.00 here in Disneyland California. Unfortunately Disney is going to continue to raise prices at all of their parks to cover the losses of their movies...
I remember growing up as a teen in the 70s.  We lived about 20 minutes away from DLand.  Our parents would drop us off for the day.  Admission was about $7.50.  We'd have a blast.  Last time I was there was about 25 years ago.  It was soooo crowded.  Today - I wouldn't even mind the expensive price but there's just too many people.
Even their toilet paper is so cheap
While don’t have so many kids 😅
Disneyland is the biggest rip off in the entire world.
Washington DC all museum are free we had a great time my kids love it.
He’s d7mb,for not knowing the price. I don’t know, but what ever the price. It’s not too much I know for sure
Why not go to a different amusement park or the beach instead? I don't know why any parents would want to take their kids there after all their left wing activism.
Dawg... you paid it tho. So you justified them charging the next person.
It doesn’t cost Disney 10x the cost of Sam’s club to buy a hot dog.  $20 for a hot dog and a drink is highway robbery when Sam’s clubs sells it for $1.49
Have not been to Disney in almost 50 years and I am glad. I can think of so many wonderful activities to do for $1,400.00. A waste of money if you ask me and a child is not going to have the self awareness and perspective to understand what a man has to do to earn that money.
Great 👍 job DAD ! But it’s 5 people ! What the heck you expect?? $14.00 !????
Enjoy the little things
And there are people who go multiple... times... a... year
Such a shame everything costs so much these days.
I went to Disneyland at least 5 times in my life. A couple as a kid and a bit in my teen years. I’m fine with it. Even for Star Wars land I don’t think I’d wanna go through that
As fun as theme parks are, the best get togethers are the ones you can hear each other talk.
And we are beyond surprised at this point 😂no new news Disney is a complete waste of that money 😮
At least it keeps the dirt people on drugs or ignorant out cause they can’t afford it
Old crying wheels back at it
I would say people CAN afford it. Ot they’re just running up the credit card (the guy mentioned ‘swiping his card all day’). If not how come there are such long lines? I’d say it’s more like people are foolish to spend that amount of money.
“Groceries were too expensive under the previous administration” Thjs woman obviously does not do her own food shopping.
Is there bill was more than my social security check; what a flip in rip off
It's Disney, what do you expect?
What do you mean it has gotten a little bit better since the last administration.  Inflation was high in the last administration and has gotten worse. I Iost six corporate clients over the last eight months. Things are going to get extremely worse over the next eight months.
Disney was always expensive so just save up or don’t go until you can afford it lol
Stop buying Disney's overpriced BS and they will lower the prices.
OUTRAGEOUS.  My husband and I went there about 40 years ago, 2 children, my Mom,  hotel, air fare, tickets for the park, which then, you could go to any section of the park , no extra cost or ticket.   Got a package deal and spent under 2, 000.  We had a wonderful time.
That's the cost for me to go to Mexico for a week all-inclusive
I used to live 20 minutes away from the parks and couldn't afford going in. My friend put it this way:  " we live near that mouse and can't afford to pay him a visit."  $200 for a ticket per person.
Ever since Trump got into office, prices have gone up astronomically.
You disney followers are losers 2×
I know the dad is thinking, we could have just talked at home sitting in the living room. I kid of course, I am sure the money spent stings, but if it creates a memory, over time, he won't care about how much he spent, but that he had that shared experience with his family. Personally I don't go to any Disney parks. I am not into Disney and quite frankly their rides and attractions don't interest me personally. I do agree, their prices are the worst of it. " A business can not be solely sustained by the desire to do good. Greed propels bsuinesses much more efficiently, and that's why socialist countries fail."
I’m shocked after knowing the occult connections of Walt, the child trafficking stings of Disney employees and the Epstein Island connection the dar is taking his kids there!
Never have been and no desire to go
That’s Dad math right there!
You could give me all the money in the world.And I would not waste one single cent of it going to disney  They need to rename it as wokey land. Instead of disney characters running around they could have a bunch of transgenders running around. 😂😂😂😂😂
*They’re movies and shows have been trash the past few years, gotta pay it back somehow*
These prices are crazy but he gave his kids an experience while people buy designer bags that cost way more while they complain about food prices and get aid from the government kudos to him for putting his kids first trust there’s plenty of people that bought the Gucci Disney colab but won’t pay for their kids Togo to Disney
DISNEY A DISGRACE FOR WHAT IT COST    TAKE UR KIDS FOR A MOVIE LUNCH AND A HIKE SAVE YOUR MONEY TARIFFS COMING IN HAARD AND FAST
If you can’t afford it, don’t go. What’s the point of whining about it on the internet? 🙄
As Rumpelstiltskin said in Once Upon A Time..... All magic comes at a price!!!
This stuff is for foreigners, not Americans. Americans need to save.
my friend paid 16, 000 k for one week 😂😂😂😂😂 family of 4
Under the last administration what about this criminal administration now 10 times worse now and will only get worse FACT
I like how she said under last administration.  Or did you mean Trump administration
thats not too much for a family of 5
i spend around 7-8k for 6days in Hawaii every year. breadwinner of family of 4 but I never btch around how expensive is America
THEN DON’T GO TO DISNEYLAND ANYMORE!!! DISNEYLAND IS JUST VERY GREEDY!!! SO IT IS NOT FOR FAMILIES THAT ARE “PINCHING PENNIES”!! HELLOOOOOO!!!!
...you can research this all before you go. & then decide to Not Go. Disney is a woke mess. Stop supporting them.
Disney is not worth it even like 10 years ago.
I lived in Florida and SoCal my whole life. Disney sucks. Go to the ocean. You’re welcome.
Sounds about right and we only went to Disneyland in Anaheim.. Lightning passes weren’t worth it..
What!? Disney is expensive?? Next you're gonna tell me the sky is blue!
What was your favorite part? “Seeing daddy swipe his card”
No wonder is empty people need to stop spending there so prices go down
Disneyland is defenitely not worth the cost. You pay a fortune to stand for one hour in a queue and the ride ends in a minute. If kids want to have fun, there are plenty of other things to do
Inflation is insane. How are these children going to afford entertainment in the future esp  with the cost of daily living.
1,400 in one day.
Come out great on that restaurant price, though.
I remember when my fam went to 6 flags. it’s not as expensive to get in as Disney but the food is the same. Hundreds of dollars for terrible food and we only had two kids. Theme parks are highway robbery and it’s a shame. We all know these big corporations over hire and over pay useless executives and that’s where a big chunk of this money is going. The whole time I kept thinking about all the people that could never afford to bring their families to a place like that.
Disney relies on stupid, weak parents to pay because children it are stupid selfish beings.
I'm not too sure what they expected.  It's a premium experience at a premium price.
Absolutely not surprising. Criminal what they charge, but not surprising.
Would’ve cancelled my trip and done something else
No wonder , I get is having heart problems The view is draining him So Disney is picking up the tab .... Your a good dad
Oh my god awful. No thanks.
Visit every 10yrs is ok for me 😅
I have been to Disney once I live in NH & I won a trip for 4 to Disney included everything, (we only  had to pay for our meals) Delta airlines tickets we stayed @ Dixie Landing, all Disney owned properties unlimited access for 8/7 I know how lucky we were to get a trip that great! We went in October so most rides were walk on most time we waited in line was 10 mins I couldn’t imagine waiting in line like the signs say 45 min or longer! 😳😳
Disney is too expensive now. It's overpriced. It's not worth paying to go to Disney anymore.
Listen at 2.22 in the video: it's gotten a bit better under this administration . . . .😂😂😂what country does she live in?
My visit to Disney extends  to watching the classic films on YouTube. The glory days of an affordable vacation to the magical kingdom are gone.
Disney, no thanks. Would rather go to Europe.
Disney is a disgrace. I'm sure Walt is spinning in his grave right now. Disney World has become little more than a park for rich people controlled by greedy woke delegates.
Stop being a bunch of bitches and just don’t go. Y’all bitches about anything just to bitches . You bitches!!
He should have researched ahead of time. Disney is EXPENSIVE! You did it once. Hope that was enough!
Overpriced mediocre food, long lines on hot days, Outrageous tacky souvenirs..nearly Fifteen Hundred bucks, its not worth the price of "magic" Disney is selling.
Why did they go the lol guy had such a bad attitude 😒
Walt Disney would be disgusted by the greed this magical place has turned into!!!  Gouging customers from every angle ,every turn is not the way to run a business. Shame on the parks management ! Disney is a rip off now!!  Not worth taking your family there anymore!!!   I have ALWAYS loved Florida,  always wanted to live there but it is becoming too expensive to even vacation there now.
It has NOT gotten better under this administration. Delusional political news. We can't afford anything during THIS administration. Stop shifting blame. He's killing our country.
What a sweet baby girl🫶🏻
So they want entertainment for the whole family and complains when its expensive. Dont go if u going to complain about price. There is alot of families whos living paycheck to paycheck and will be happy to have food on the table and make rent.
Go get a Corvette 😮😮
I was just there in April and ticket prices were like $119 per person. 7 days costed me $2700 for just me or $385 per day.  I went to all 4 Disney parks and Universal Studios.
call it greed, call it as you want it. If I sell something overpriced and still sell it, I'll keep raising the price until I am not able to sell anymore. Im a capitalist. Yes it's not nice, Disney is for kids and they are taking advantage of the parents love for their children, but no one said capitalism was perfect. At least you can teach your kids to learn that some things in life are too expensive and not worth that much.
There is only a very small piece of American families they can afford to visit Disneyland… it’s sad that so many kids don’t get the opportunity to visit Disneyland at a young age because most parents simply don’t have the means to afford it
I took my 2 kids there in 08, Just for the 3 of us, I spent over 2k, 17 years ago........😳
You are "trying to pinch pennies" and decide to go to Disneyland???? Makes no sense!!!  Thats not "pinching pennies"!!
This is pure propaganda. You don't do a Disney 'day trip' then leave at night to go outside of the parks to Disney Springs. Geez! I could have spent an entire week at the parks for not much more money.   You don't go just 1 day. If you go 1 day, it costs $180. If you go 5 days, it costs $50/day - $250 total.
Disneyland is a scam.
Dude it’s a family of 5…. That’s not had….??? Am I missing something
I was not suprised when we travelled from Finland to go to Disneyworld. I expected everything in USA to be crazy expensive and I was right.  Next time we will go to a European amusement park. Gardaland in Italy or Efteling in Netherlands.
Thanks for sharing bro...1300..not bad..Costa Rica is cheaper
the last administration is gone-this is the trump/republican economy destroying our country.
Doesn’t seem that bad for world class amusement park
I feel every comment here points to a successful business: - We complain about the prices but at the same time the park is super busy and full - businessman’s dream - Kept asking the daughter if it was worth it and she didn’t say “no” - so it WAS worth it! - Dad isn’t happy bc Disneyworld arguably isn’t specifically targeted at middle aged dads … unless he’s a Starwars fan which he didn’t indicate as such - Complained abt the lines but it’s the first thing daughter thinks was a highlight of the trip!   I feel Disney would hear all of these and be pretty happy with the result!
Crazy Stupid
What rock has he been living under. He got off cheap
That is fk ridiculous Jesus they so greedy
They should rebrand...the most expensive place on earth...lol
I used to go there every year. The past 3 years we started doing cruises during the off season instead and it's a longer vacation for less money. You get to eat free and you can choose if you want to spend the extra money on a fancy restaurant or not.
Relatable! We paid same price for family of three at Disneyland two years ago with lightning pass. Didn’t get us on much faster. Additionally, we waited nearly an hour for two different rides that we didn’t get to go on because one closed for safety check, another closed because it started to sprinkle. Two hours lost! I really tried to enjoy the day, but with mass crowds, extremely high prices, and so many rides closed due to refurbishment, it was difficult. The worst part was realizing that most families in our country can’t afford it, it’s for the rich. Won’t be going back.
I don't get all that complaining when everything he did was voluntary...
Disgusting
I remember walt disney saying he wanted ticket prices to stay affordable for kids so they all can in joy it.
😮😮      wrong dinner choice. Buddy
Until the people stop watching Disney movies and stop going to the park its going to keep going. Only the rich can go. STOP BUYING THE MOVIES AND ANYTHING ELSE DISNEY
It’s not a pilgrimage, you don’t have to visit Disney.
1500$ to stand in lines with a bunch of screaming kids... sounds like hell.
Over $200 per person for just a day??  No thanks. We used to go to Astroworld in Houston for $200 a day for 6 people.
That little girls answer was a surprise. But that's how feel to I love long lines I enjoy talking to people that come from around the world.
Awesome! A daughter that just enjoys being in the company of family.   There is definitely a lot of opportunity for cheaper, if not free, trips. Lucky man.
lol honestly you shouldn’t be surprised at Disney.
Old Walt concieved parks based on FAMILY. Iger runs parks based on hate and moneygrubbing.
My monthly income.     But then again, every day is Disney World for me.   lol
Disney is a plastic paradise; the ultimate distorted American dream. Not worth the price of admission.
Prices will stay as long as people are paying.  STOP GOING.
If your trying to save money going to Disney, why would you pay for food? Anyone can bring in food - he could have saved hundreds by doing that.   Also, no one is forcing anyone to go to Disney. If you don’t want to pay the price, don’t go. You also have 3 kids so anywhere you go will be expensive to buy tickets for 5 people. Everywhere is inflated, Universals tickets are in a very similar margin (like $10 difference) to Disney and people aren’t complaining about that for some reason.
2:24 Not really. Everything has gone up here
universal is no better.
That dad was holdng backk tears. Awesome kid dad
It was expensive for my parents to take me in 1988, I could just imagine now😮
2:15 😂😂😂😂😂
people didn't know that going to Disney is outrageously expensive?
Insane price tag
I bet he's fun to go on vacation with. Not 😂
That's how you keep Black people out . Raise the prices.
lol.   bring  your  own  food  and  drinks  next  time.
And you live in america 🇺🇸 imagine as a Canadian with the poor exchange rate plus hotel and the air fare.
Disgusting greed by the rich in this country.
$1400 more towards the woke child indoctrination park for 1 day.  That's 3 months of groceries or 1 month rent or 3 car payment or a whole year of car insurance.  Suckers😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What did you expect? It’s ran by liberals isn’t it??
Why are you surprised
I can pay a little over $400 a year to go to Disney as much as I want. Lightning lanes are a luxury. I’ll pack my lunch. I’m sorry these people are ignorant that they can’t control their spending.
Say  No to this crap.  You don't need it.
I was last to Disney World in 1992.... and I thought, "Wow, everything here is really expensive!"
Cost for the Happiest Place on Earth.  Walt Disney dream was to have family have fun at a affordable price. Making family go broke is not Walt Disney dream.
I went to Disneyland in France. Cost my spouse and I $700 Canadian and I never even got to see a princess. There was a few villains walking around and some storm troopers. I was so disappointed.
Welcome to the party pal!!!  That’s why it’s a once in a lifetime trip.
not bad he paid $1k + just to spend time to queue.
But he got his fifteen of fame
He is idiot
Disney sucks
Well thats what u get for having a family 😵‍💫
His daughter had the right answer.  She made sure her dad knew it was all worth it. 😢
I mean it cost money to do things yo.  Why do think most people don’t go to Disney.  Who’s fault is it that it cost you $1000 dollars for lunch?
You don’t have to be expensive to have fun at Disney.
Depends what you spend money on and how you can control yourself. I never spend that much at Disney. Need control
you see that yutube plaque on the wall .well that means he makes enough money on his videos as a youtuber to pay for that trip easy work.
It's cheaper to take the kids to Europe honestly and they'll get more out of it. Where does this woman get that things are cheaper these days??? 😂😂😂 Obviously she hasn't been to the grocery store or researched what these tariffs are going to do.
Big time amusement parks are always gonna charge you an arm and a leg
Why is he complaining if he has and is promoting his YouTube channel on a nationwide show? Like he didn’t use his YouTube money to pay for the day. Also, an annual pass would be way cheaper. But content needs to be made.
Stop having ten kids then complaining about costs associated.
Trump and desantits fault
Def rip off
Ain’t nobody got money for Disney. Lucky children . I hope you thank dad a lot! 😂 the parking . They own the land. Cut that price! They get plenty of money from souvenirs, and food ,drinks. That’s what they should see how much it would cost a day for a family of 4,3,2.  I went when in the 90s when my kids were little. But seeing the prices now. I’ll never go again!  I would love to go as an adult. 😢😢😢😢
Always the victims. So the message here is just be exploited if you can afford it.
Lady quit lying this shyt ain't got better it's worse and horrible. No jobs, people laid off nobody hiring. Trump is making this country worse again. Him and his crew can go. Including this boot licking lady. Im sure if Trump pissed in a cup some of these trumpets would drink it. 😮
Thanks to Trump. This shyt is way too expensive.
That is not what walt had in mind😢
Disney  is the spawn  of Satan,  kids crying everywhere,  4 hour lines, no thanks . That  is a mortgage  payment.  Never again  !!
Just don't go. A place from hell and is not worth it.
Brace yourself. I lived in Florida when Disney opened . $12 got you a book of tickets for the whole park and any tickets you didn't use on your first trip could be rolled over and used your next trip. My brother's company worked on the Hall Of Presidents so he qualified to attend this hugh party Disney threw for all who had worked on the Disney project prior to the grand opening. At that party Disney officials promised that Disney would ALWAYS be kept affordable for families. My my, but haven't times changed?
Well americans will have to pay as we arent coming america. To expensive  and rude americans everywhere. Europe is finished with you money,money,money.  Disney will find it hard no holiday makers now coming younwill find it harder. Trump did it to all you stupid americans.
She must live under a rock.  Inflation hasn’t gone down!!!! It’s rising every freaking day!   Oh I forgot this is Fox.  Of course it’s all great!! NOT!
Better off going to a nature park
*Dad goes somewhere expensive*  *is shocked that it is expensive*  .... make it make sense lol
Just going to Disneyland is very stupid,because of overpricing...I would rather spend time at beach closed by...
I'll never go to Disney again we stayed at one of the resorts and as we were staged to put on a GPS bracelet it took 45 minutes.  I didn't go there to be held up in a room I'll never go again and cancel my Disney app and Hulu.  I'm glad there in collapse. I gave up marvel  films as well.
DISNEYLAND IS NOT WORTH IT------SAVE YOUR MONEY----CORPORATE GREED AND WOKE STUPIDNESS.
Walt would be throwing up inhis own grave knowing the woke  mutants took over his dream of bringing joy to children 😮       sad
I never got why they don't build a subway to the park. In Los Angeles we have one for Universal Studios, for example.
What your family's not worth it ?????
At the end of the day this is consider FIRST WORLD problems.  Nobody forced him to go. You cant whine when you CHOOSE to walk through the gates. I too made that choice as a family of 5. It wasnt an easy pill to swallow, but i did it for family memories.
Does this guy live under a rock? Lol
And he still bought the Mini Ears, ROFL.  What a loser.  Must have voted for Kaamala
Staying a wk w hopper passes, each day the passes actually get cheaper and it’s cheaper to eat there if you purchase the food plan. The one yr I saved about 200.00 just by using the food plan. I would never pay extra for those passes to get on rides faster. When we are at Epcot we ride Test Track, it’s quicker if you do single rider. You can basically walk right on the ride and you don’t pay extra, they just want to fill that unused set…..lol….you got to know the ins and outs.
Far more expensive now all thank to trump
Spent many many great and fun times at Disney in the past. I would never go again NEVER, EVER. WHAT A WASTE
Me and my daughter went 725.78
Not my idea of a good time.  Disney knows parents want to treat their kids to this experience and so far will pay whatever Disney charges.  There comes a time when you have to look at other options to have fun with their kids.  Like this little girl said.  Kids just want to have fun with their family.  They don't need Disney!
Over $900 for a family of 5 😮 are they high? Too expensive
What was the purpose of saying "not being able to afford groceries in the previous administration". Let me just block this channel
I feel like he got fast pass
Self inflicted wounds. No sympathy. Why raise a Disney kid?
NEVER!!!!
Stop lFOX you guys know it trumpy fault and you still stay it was biden ,you all dumb
Zero desire to go visit libtardville.
Anyone that gives money to that company deserves to be ripped off!
The last 10 years we have built a society that is only accessible to the wealthy..including home ownership. This can't go on forever. You politicians and wealthy don't think we're all just going to live in a shack while we just serve you indefinitely do you? Get familiar with history, it's predictable.
OMG//////
I'll never go to Disney. Ever. It isn't even close to worth the money. That's a rent payment right there
The price for my 9 days to diseny and universal trip in September is 11k.
I went 1 once and never again going back
Not worth it at all
She’s happy but he’s mad lol
Disney has become too greedy!!
That's absolutely ridiculous ! This is the #1 reason my grown children never got to go to Disney, as a child. Thanks Disney.
Why keep going? Save the money for your kids college.
Were planning for family trip there, but after listening about these expenses and especially wait times for rides, just not worth it. Six flags is a lot better option for costs, although wait times are basically the same.
Pinch pennies? His idea and my idea of pinching pennies are not the same, he's going to amusement parks and I'm deciding whether rent or power is going to become my personal harasser this month, I like to switch it up so that it stays interesting.
San Diego Zoo is better to visit ❤ 🐼
Crazy
Hopefully everyone has fun.
Disney is over rating crap. I used to work there it was nice, not anymore. Stop paying them money.
And this makes headlines how when we got people out here that cant even afford food or rent. We need constant headlines on the inflation for the cost of surviving not the extras in life.
Disney are thieves
2:20 "under the last administration it's gotten a little bit better" Honey really? Any administration the US have had for the better part of half a century was lead by corporations, with the main drive to profit shareholders most and therefore enable corporate greed and it hasn't gotten any better. Disney has so many moralizing stories of greedy rich evil and poor sympathetic do-gooders it is an absolute disgrace they charge people like this, excluding anyone with a lower income to ever being able to visit.
over rated tourist trap
Gosh! I gasped when I read that price.😱🦘
The lines were long so obviously people are still willing to pay. On the bright side, the high price keeps out the rif-rafs and the undesirables.
Who the heck is still going to Disney?  Suckers.
If she liked talking to her famiky for $1400, that kind of sends a veiled message too.
And yet they still go like its a birth right 🤣 americans are so fkn dumb 🤣
Its not just Disney, look at Vegas too.  Inflation is one thing, but it affects TANGIBLE goods.  So yeah the food keeps getting more and more expensive, but any corporation that wants to tell me that parking fees and resort fees and check in fees are because inflation - can kiss my @$$.  Disney takes the inflation and doubles down on the greed in a super obvious way that makes it so much easier to target them with rage.  We're still years away from when inflation makes actual milk cost $10/glass like it does at disney.
Disneyland is a human trap that corporate rats use on people who pay to stand in lines all day as they get fleeced. I remember going to Disneyland when it was normal back in the 60's and 70's.
Try that for 9 days plus add the rental car and the airbnb lol
He knew it wasn't going to be cheap for a family of 5. He's  a manchild
Welcome to the real world dad! You're not living in the 80s when a pack of four donuts were $1.12.
You guys keep on going and spending your money at the Disney world and disneylands I want to take my kids to the national Parks and have real vacation, this will help keep the crowds down at the parks.  What he spent one day I spend in one week in the Black hills.  Let's not forget he didn't include lodging while he was down there.   My kids are grown up now and they still want to go to the Black hills, not one time have they asked to go to a amusement park again.   I wouldn't want to spend $100 a person to go spend a day in that crowded park standing in lines for hours, forget that.
$100 a yearly pass for locals on the Gold Coast, QLD… $100 for 3 Parks with WB, Seaworld and Wet and Wild Pass, that would be $2500 in Oz
I Will Never Go There !!!
Ron DeSantis took the day off with his family how nice ....
Parking used to be free , is crazy that charging for parking, is not right
Crazy is a night mare to go Disney
Went there in 1959, had $15 to spend.  Admission was about $2, E rides were   $0.65, I had a hot dog, drink, and did mnmany of the other attractions. Uncle  picked us up at 4:00, gave him back some change. Knotts Berry Farm was always free, 4 years ago, $8 to park, $21 to get in.
I went to Disney World once back in the mid eighties.  Have never been again.  Nothing worth spending thousands of dollars on.
Disney is a one shot for a lifetime
hahahahahahahaha😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  of course "under the last administration"😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Maga make it Great again :-)
WOW boycott Disney  Overpriced and American 😮
Wow, thats truly experience reserved for wealthy people only. Walt Disney will not approve that.
I fear for the financial future for our kids😢
what a weenie grow some balls
And without the line cut pass you really only get to go on 2-3 rides max.
If Disney can charge prices like this and still be "packed" why wouldn't they?
Thats Folroda for you! Your state is a joke!
One word "corporate GREED"
I went the first year Disney World open up. And I can tell you I didn't pay anywhere near what he paid. I stopped traveling in America, it has become way too expensive today. I travel to Thailand today where it is still much cheaper than America is today. Even with counting the airfare,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Im going to Fl this winter. The amount you paid for your Disney trip is how much I paid for my 4 day cruise. Afterwards, we will be in Orlando and we will skip Disney but go for Papa Pig theme park for fraction of ticket price
Process for the time u had for ur family.yes it is costly though.u better feel happy than sad amd not with your family or not have a family at all.
Disney needs to get off their high horse! I've never been there and I don't care to. I'd rather go to the mountains.
I don’t know how families do American pastimes anymore! Bowling- very expensive! Ball games-very expensive! Amusement parks- so sad!
Dad says "We are all trying to pinch pennies", then decides to take his family out to Disney vacation. Cost of Disney vacation is expensive now and was even 10 years ago.
We have family in Orlando and on the many occasions that we have visited them, we've often thought about going to Disney World. We can afford it. We're smart enough not to pay for it. Luxury is not a necessity. There are a thousand other affordable options to spend time with family. I don't blame Disney for this either. It's the nature of supply and demand.
Don't act shocked... you knew exactly how much a day at Disney would cost. If you're spending 1k for 1 family fun day  then your not pinching pennies.
Keep losing international turism and prices will keep going up. Until Disney moves to El Salvador
Ridiculous, license to steal, shame
Love Disney world, he spend it because he wanted too, I could go the same days as him and spend less than half of that.  Also how much is an two hour concert or sports game?  Disney, Universal ect is an alll day experience  well worth the price.
I was driving the shuttle bus between Disney and Hyatt Grand Cypress  SHTTLE BUSES PAY $35.00 per day  BRINGING PEOPLE TO THE PARKS ALL DAY LONG
WHAT A MONUMENTAL WASTE OF $$$
Not worth it its soo packed and you cant get on all the rides
most people can't afford to go once
🧚🏻‍♀🏰💫✨💰...the ultimate Tourist Trap....
If your a business owner just raise the costs to your customers to pass along raising costs.
No costs ate not going up, the value of the dollar is going down.
Why are you  whining? No one said you have to go.  No one says everyone needs to go.  Punished? Really? GROW UP.
Idk also depends on the type of parent you can definitely buget it right. It will be expensive but thats implied when its disney world.
Don't go simple
Disney trip cost is out of control
Your a Good Dad.
F Disney
I don’t believe anybody feels bad for them lol
Walt Disney is rolling over in his grave
The fact that people feel the need and desire to go to places like this blows me away.  Its nothing more than a fake, expensive experience.
Real Florida people dont go to Disney.
Way before 2020 that 1400 was enough for almost a week for a family of 4, then it was enough for 3 days and now only 1???!???
3:22 the moment he realised, talking with each other was enough
Wait till Disney is exposed
Cant you take your own food and drinks in??  Are there taps there where you can get water, there was nearly 40 years ago  i will be doing Disney on a budget when it comes to food.  There is no point over loading with food and drinks just because it is there. If the dad did his homework maybe a different outcome.  i am sure there are package deals.  But i wouldn't pay $44 for a lite saver when you can get them anywhere for less than half that price
Waiting for the company go bankrupt.
Disney people are rediculas.  They deserve to get robbed by choice by Disney
And so it begins, Vegas, Disneyland, money 🤑🚗🚗🚗🚗
There nothing magic about spending thousands of dollars to spend hours in long lines in the 90 degree weather, Disney sucks.
Then why go ..stop crying about it..
No different than aTaylor Swift concert!!! But the concert was for 2???????
Unless you have been hit with a rock, how do you not know what the prices will be?  Don’t they have an internet signal where they live?
Better off going to Universal/Islands of Adventure/Epic Universe.
Never I will go
To be fair, Disney world is a resort not simply a theme park. It isn't meant for a day trip, but for people to spend 4 days plus. The longer you stay the daily rate decreases substantially. Not saying that is is affordable or that the quality hasn't decreased significantly, but Disneyworld is not Disneyland and comparing the cost of a day trip is disingenuous because it is priced that way to keep people from doing just that.
This reporter is living in space I think. The prices were NOT higher under the Last admin... There were no huge tariffs. More fox bs lies..
What’s the point?  You walk, stand, and eat.    Take a road trip instead and actually see things worth seeing.   Disney World is the ultimate in excessive consumption.
I remember going to Disney Magic Kingdom in 1973.  I arrived around 4 or 5pm, and stayed for the fireworks.  As a 20 year old at the time the cost wasn't a big deal.  Things changed in the 80's.
He’s right and that’s not including having to pay for the lightning pass otherwise the lines are crazy. Plus some of the popular rides don’t allow lightning passes so you have to wait with everyone else. It’s very expensive. We did it because kids wanted to do it but we told them next time they’ll go will be with their own kids. lol
This is very sad 💔
It will always be packed. Americans spend  big money!!
Forrest Gump said it best: stupid is as stupid does. You ought to be able to have "fun" for nothing.  Why do you have to puke this up for alleged "fun"?  This is what happens when wimmen take over a country.
The Happiest Place on Earth (until you get the bill) 🤯😖
Imagine being from out of town and staying in the hotels for 3-4 days in addition
Little girl will just remember her dad grumbling all day about the cost and it will be a sour memory
Imagine buying plane tickets plus hotel
never understood that so many other places to go  in Florida and with the freedom to choose where to eat and relax once you go in Disney you loose all of that
Been there twice , will never go back , too many fairys and way to $ , it's a big waste of money , thier about woke as they can get , this company needs to learn a very expensive lesson , stop supporting the woke
The last administration????
if it's too expensive. you need to make more money.
Live in motel 6 off property.  Eat in restaurants off property.  Just buy the base tickets.. no park hopper tix.
We spent that much on two people.. food, treats, souvenirs, pictures. Hey go to a carnival! Vist the park on a slower day?..quit having childeren!!!?oh and the bow disneynears hat is accepted, but it's standard for woam or girls or females to wear ❤,  me thinks
The real problem is the consumer! Until people stop absorbing these ridiculous prices on everything and start really boycotting products and services this will continue. People using their credit cards for everything has destroyed our economy, if you can't pay cash to go out and eat or for your Starbucks or your nails or anything that isn't a major purchase then you can't afford it. This generation needs to learn to go without, they were never told "no" growing up and they think they're entitled to have whatever they want and they have no idea how to budget and tell themselves they can't afford it.  I feel for the dad in the video because this wasn't a planned trip so he wasn't expecting to spend this money. And Disney should be ashamed of their GREED!
Go to a local park that has some nice trails and spend the day hiking with your kids. Cost next to nothing and they will enjoy it more.
From Canada 🇨🇦 I’ll go to another country instead.
Make America Greedy Again! Hahaha 😂😂😂
Disney land has a lot of Hitten secrets untold what was discovered under
What a rip off!
Too bad for you someone has to pay no more Canadians to gouge
Just dont go there
Amazes me people of their own free will go and pay the price then complain.  How stupid is that??
Where has it gotten better? It's only going to get a lot worse after the BB bill hits it's worse cuts right after the midterms!
Disney is going to price themselves out of business……. We have become disenchanted with Disney’s, “Magic” anymore….There was a time, We, the wife and I, have gone to WDW many, many years in a row, 20+. Roughly 1995-2018. We last went in 2018 stopped as we decided to hold off going again until the grandkids became old enough to enjoy it, and take them, say when they became 5-7 yrs old or so. However, the last couple times there say, 2016-17, we began to finally seen how, Disney has become the, “epitome of corporate greed.”  Money, money, money. The cost of things are so high for even the simplest things, and recall, I’m talking about raising prices and cutting services and attractions, for the past 7-8 yrs. They have raised prices so much and many times.  For most families this is probably a once in a lifetime trip due to the cost factor, if they even can afford that one time trip…My wife and I would go for 9 days, staying on site at Port Orlean’s, (this is actually 7 days, depending on travel times. (I.e. leave home early morning on the first day to get there and checked in to the hotel by noon-1 o’clock, have half a day at a park, but you leave on the last day (9) giving us really only 7 out of 9 days at WDW). This for us this was approx $3500-$4000 airfare included… I finally checked recently on going now that the grandkids are older and would enjoy it, and found that a trip, (if booked today) for NEXT YEAR (June 2026) for 4…us and 2 grandchildren, for ONLY 6 DAYS, (thus actually 4 to as explained above) comes  to approx $4500-$5000, NOT INCLUDING airfare which is another $$1500-$2,000, depending on flights.. Then you have to add food costs and incidentals while there, say maybe  $500-$800 (?)…  I just can’t see roughly, $7,000+ for a maximum 4 AND A HALF DAYS… and it gets worse with all Disney’s Covid-19 “restrictions”, of what you may or not be able to do. Poor Walt Disney himself probably turned in his grave many times and has been crying for years, looking down and seeing  what his dream has become, as they move farther and father away from his ideas.
Luckily your video paid for everything
Only the 1 percent can go and they get to deduct there trip expenses on there taxes so the taxpayers pay for the trip
Keep charging more, they will come.
Boycott Disney, never go, never visit, never look cable...
The best part of Disney? Standing around and talking in line for hours. We could’ve done that for free at a state park with snacks and no $Million Dollar tickets
Why would you promote Disney (wearing the rat ears) while you complain about Disney....MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE!!!!
His estimate of $2000 USD for the day trip with the express pass is the same cost for all 5 to go on a 1 week all-inclusive to Cuba from Toronto ... that includes airfare, hotel, food, booze, activities, transfers and taxes for all 5!
I switched my vacation from the USA for a family of 5, two weeks in their more premium resorts (around 17grand) To Scotland and Canadas east coast and saved money. I would have went to Disney still regardless of price but like most say where I’m from F the USA
450k subscribers I’m sure his YouTube money bought the Disney trip.
Real story: man buys tickets at gate rather than multi-day discounted package. Congratulations, he's an idiot.  Yes, I agree it's expensive but there are smart ways to buy things (deals, packages, in advance) and dumb ways (at the gate, day of, no planning).  Also he's on Fox News which says a lot.
That’s $1,400 for seven people. That’s about $100 for rides and $100 for food per person. It costs $100 per person for a movie and dinner.
Robbery
Fox news talking about his sibling disney it's funny
My 6-day trip 4-park week at Pop Century for my girlfriend and I costed us 5k, and our airfare was covered with points except for the taxes. With kids I'm sure it would've been close to the 10k$ mark...
It seems the kids appreciate the time spent with their parents, Disney or not.
As much as I like Disneyland, it doesn’t seem worth it for the price. I’m just lucky that I know someone that works there so I can get in for free
I still dream about taking my two daughters
He has a nice youtube channel
“After the last administration prices were high and now they are getting better”   The only thing that is high is the blonde hosting it.  The peroxide clearly fried her brain cells.
OMG THIS IS SO EXPENSIVE!  *continues to go anyway*  The sheer genius of the Fox News watcher.
How long has this guy been in Florida? Everyone knows that everything here is expensive, especially if it has to do with recreation and stay.
That’s why it’s a “once in a lifetime” trip for most families.
Annual passes are the ticket.  Pardon the pun.
Once that little girl has to start paying she’s gonna realize it’s really not worth it.  Disney parks are completely over rated.
You can buy a 65” OLED TV, or Gaming PC, or 12” iPad Pro, Offset smoker, entire wardrobe for work, New tires, and many more things that will entertain you for a lot longer than 1 day…but the women want “memories.”
Here's a little Disneyland hack to help you save a little cash: Show us your Disneyland ticket and get a FREE APPETIZER for you table. We're only a 15 min drive from Disneyland ;)
You all are bunch crying communist dip shitz.. this is America. If you dont like the prices dont go. You want disney to lower prices just for you.. entitled. I would've expected to watch this garbage on communist cnn. What a joke. Fox is now for liberal woke snowflakes.
You were pinching pennies huh? Stupid.
Don't waste your time
Idiotic! If he LIVES in Florida he KNEW the cost AHEAD of time... This guy is just a NARCISSISTIC CLOWN 🤡🤡🤡 looking for attention
I remember when it was two days for $100
More fool him
Disney did there job. Those kids got their day no matter how much it costed their parents.
Let the government take over Disney and give it to us for free hahaha
Boycott this woke rubbish…don’t give them your money!
😂😂😂 of course they flopped all their movies 🎬 😂😂😂
It's probably not bad when paying for one or two people, but paying for the whole family must be a hassle. It's no wonder why my parents never took us.
I think the granddaughter of Disney is outraged at the prices too.
So, if he knew that amount was too much, why go in the first place? He's such a complainer.
Dad just say you’re cheap lol let’s go home
IF you go to Disney with your family, stand in line all day and pay robbery prices, YOU ARE STUPID! Forest Gump, “stupid is what stupid does”!
"last administration" UM NO 🗣️THIS ADMINISTRATION WTH ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT LADY
Most of us parents know that that’s why we can’t ever go afford to go or would spend that much money
Dissney world is way to hjgh priced disney really needs to lower every high prices to bring in the people
Im more of a $50 or below kind of spender.  Disney aint what it use to be. The Magics been long gone in my opinion for years.
That’s outrageous!! I wouldn’t ever go there again it’s been 20 yrs and no Ty not worth it it’s a shame that you need to spend soo much rather fo the beach 🏖️
You know it was coming 😴
I am amazed people are still going to These Rip off Parks. Christ We went to the NC Zoo and a Burger Was $15.  I will now entertain my family in other ways.  I now Boycott them all.
Lmfaoooo his rocking the ears lmfaooooo
Disney are definitely out pricing themselves. I won't be going again,due to the greed. Walt would be turning in his grave.
Get a pass or just don’t go 😂
He knew what it was going to cost before he arrived at Disney. Now he's butt hurt. So immature! I don't go to a nice seafood restaurant, order a three pound lobster and cry that it costs too much. If I can't afford it, there are thousands of other food options. I live in Florida. There are SO MANY cheap or free, wonderful family friendly things to do here.
The best part was standing in line chatting to her family.  So dad just wasted lots of money on something his daughter didn't even enjoy that much.  They could have just stood outside the park chatting and she'd have been just as happy! lol
I took my family to disney 10yrs ago and said never again. It wasn't just because the price were insane, it was because after paying the crazy amount , you stand in line for at least an hour and a half to two hours for a ride. There are so many people in the park you are bumping into people constantly. My kids were even overwhelmed and got frustrated by the insane long waits in the line. I bought a fast pass for one of the rides and we still had to wait at 45 mins. My kids will tell you they would never want to go back there. At the time they were 7, 8, and 11 yrs old at the time.
Nothing new! Disney only cares about the rich. They have intentionally priced out the average American!
Put this in context for my US Friends............a family of 4 can get flights from UK to Malaga in South of Spain (2.5 hours flight) and a hotel for a long weekend (friday to sunday night ) for this   You can even find trips to Paris or Rome for the same ..........DIsney is not worth it
Jesus fookin christ. Americans who go to Disney simply reveals their lack of intellectual curiosity. Paying ridiculous amounts of money to look at imaginary cartoon figures and to sit in a contraption to either goes up and down, side to side  or spins is amazingly stupid. Plus, paying 15 dollars for a sickening hot dog and a drink. But what do you expect from the disney culture society which is full of stupid, ignorant, materialistic, violent, obese, psychotic and uncultured people without much education? Disney shows, fast foods, the kardashians, cheap beer, 24 hr low IQ sport entertainment, industrialized foods, etc, etc......yep, the american dream!
That kids favourite part of Disney was waiting on line in 100° weather! Hahahaha she was schooled,rehearsed. Told to say that by Dad.  Silly cheesy crap.
How in the hell do that many folks even afford to go and why the hell we so willing to pay these prices
"Under the last administration" She had to throw that in there. I swear man...😒
I wouldn’t go to Disney if it was in my backyard!
Fox attacking amusement parks,cause maga hats not allowed😅
Not just Disney, same thing happening in the grocery store 😢
1400 $ for Woke parade. No thanks!
I’ll be honest with y’all. I agree that Disney is not worth it, I agree that the prices for this stuff have become absurd. But this guy is not a real man. He completely sacrificed his family’s appreciation and enjoyment of a nice trip all for the chance to complain about it on national TV. Even the news anchor is aware of that with the last question she asked. His daughter’s answer really put this cheapskate in his place. This guy is more concerned with his wallet than his family.
That just looks miserable in every way. Shame on the kids and wife for putting the dad through that.
Yeah I'm not going there
Besides the rip off charges, Disney has become a homosexual romper room.  Why do homosexual males, have a creepy need to make a children's amusement park, their LGBTQ gathering ground?
Visited Disney with my wife, daughter, and in-laws almost ten years ago, and thought the prices were unreasonable then. 😂😂 Now that daughter's all grown up, and only remembers parts of our visit there, oddly enough she recalls everyone being together at the hotel. She actually remembers our visit to the Nickelodeon resort the same year it closed, more than Disney and Disney happened after. I'd suggest a short or long road trip depending on your child and tolerance for driving,there's plenty sights/places to see a lot cheaper and affordable than Disney.
Wow
Universal in LA also a money making scam. So overrated too.
You have to pay to play
Some how in my mind, if you can see that the economy on a regular day is completely over priced. I don't see why you would believe the Disney wouldn't at least cost you for a four day night and trip not cost you at least 4,000 to enjoy yourself comfortable after all the hotel and stay is paid. I would have just at this point known that and I don't have kids. I can imagine how much electronics cost when you just have kids and toys
Please please cry me a river
Family of 5 that’s what u get ! No one said have kids !
What a waste of money
Hey, a lease you took your family to the destiny land and enjoyed time with them. Sometimes, it is all about the quality time with your family, not the money.
I can't wait for the day we the people take back our power! Stop buying fast food, stop going to Disney. Stop going to the movies and especially stop buying their OVERPRICED food. Stop doing the same at the game, we all have been duped into getting a cold bevvy and nachos at the ball game... STOP!! Its really that simple!
Boycott everything disney,
Glorified amusement park severely overrated
Little girls answer to what her favorite part was just blew me away. Almost shed a tear.
Clever girl
Wake-Up!, World!, The Disney-Resorts, World-Wide, have a, Brand-New, Secret-Anthem. If you haven't, Already, heard it, Playing, Over and Over, ln the corner of your mind, As your Exiting, Any of their Parks, or After, Checking-Out, From any of their Hotels...  It's called,"Gotcher Money, After All!" 💰
Why people would bring their kids to that have got to mentally deranged
Blah blah go somewhere else isnt Disney getting kind of old   you know it's nothing but a crime neighborhood do your homework people
No thank you Disney!! Dollywood all the way!
I’ve been amazed how a family could go to Disney, stay in hotel etc… you can’t bring your own food or drink either. I never go!
I have a friend that goes there every year! A family of 4. I think they buy packages deals, that covers the cost of everything.
It's cheaper to go to magic mountain and parking is free. Disneyland is overrated. 💩💩💩💩😂
My wife and I are DVC members. One night's lodging costs us $250 at the Grand Floridian. Two tickets is $275, and about $80 for food. Six hundred dollars for a PREMIUM day at DisneyWorld, which included five star accomodations. Dude isn't very smart, and TRIED to spend as much money as he could.
Not the happiest place on earth it’s the greediest place on heart
Not the happiest place on earth it’s the greediest place on heart
The food its horrible and do expensive
I haven’t been to Disneyland in 25 years it’s too expensive
It’s better to save up ahead like a year ahead so yuo won’t be so stressed out
People really need to realize consumers have a lot more power. All the power actually. They can choose just not to go & not give them their money. Corporations get away with high prices cause ya’ll keep buying
News: Things in the US are....EXPENSIVE?!?!?!?
Disney is the biggest rip-off ever.
It's sad that, when people think of Florida, they think of the Mouse Trap. It's such a beautiful state with so many things to do that cost a fraction of the price!
Walt Disney NEVER INTENED  THIS CRAP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GREEDY GREEDY GREEDY !!!
The daughter was happy just standing in line talking with her family. Didnt need to pay $1400 for that
9000 dollars for 4 days resort and a 3 day fast pass. I don’t understand how so many people have this money.
1st mistake. Going to disney
Disney, like Vegas has fallen victim to unbridled greed; one of the seven deadly sins as old as the world.  Wonder what Walt would say about what his kingdom now.......?
😂😂😂😂 RIP OFF
I took my daughter to Disneyworld because she wanted to meet Tinkerbell. -- Instead, she met "Tinker Bill".
Boycott Disney that is ridiculous!!!
We paid 30.00 a ticket in Disneyland and no parking fees. Back in the day of course. But still😳
It cost a lot of money to keep the dream alive.
Then defund Disney, Daddy O.  Less expensive alrernatives are everywhere.
Theres no crying in Baseball &  Disney
Until they take the SPEW off the air,  Disney will noy get a dime of my  money....
Disney is turning in to a luxury hand bag brand for Kids....Got to have it and I am going to get it now matter the cost is...
People need to boycott Disney until they lower prices.
rip off
"That dang mouse swiped your cheese"!
Where have grocery prices gone down? Mine have increased over the last 6 months.
It’s horrible how expensive it is 😢😢😢
I still remember the time when my mother screamed and threw a fit when we went to Dutch Wonderland, and they wanted to charge eight dollars for an unlimited ride all day ticket.  She said that was highway robbery.  My father said that it was bad enough that he had to pay 75 cents to go across Frances Scott Key Bridge.  All I was doing was sitting in the back seat of the car praying "God, get me through this!"
EVERYONE knows the cost before they go.  DUHHHHH!
Scrooge!
Went woke! Not the happiest place anymore! Not needed
Dad is so cheap 😅 It is what it is
This makes absolutely no sense that we are putting this on the news like if he's the only one paying 1400$ at Disney lol the news is a joke man.
shame on disney. honestly if things were a little more affordable people would keep spending and come back more so they wouldn't be losing.  For example if it costs half to get in people would be more likely to get gifts or eat more food , lets be reasonable
That's the same amount to go skiing for the day .
Nope.. not worth it
Joy is supposed to be reacheable for all incomes
Don't GO! What's the issue?!
DISNEYLAND LA. WAS 35 DOLLARS, INTO THE MID LATE 90'S!....WOKE DEI ISN'T CHEAP
I absolutely despise ALL theme parks. They’re nothing but complete ripoffs. I’d rather chill at home for basically free. And yeah: Disney is the ultimate ripoff.
Craig from Flying Wheels
Legit rubbery !
Woke Disney is not the family oriented company it once was, with Mickey, Pluto, and Donald waving a rainbow flag. It is sad parents cannot provide a fun part of family life that was available to previous generations.
In Germany at a fun park i go to: parking 5€, five tickets 110€, lunch for 5 would be 80€, some snacks and extras for everyone 50€. About $300 and that is with inflation
Despite the price the park was packed 😅
Oh ya its crazy they can definitely make it more affordable and still make a hefty profit
Disney World is a comically terrible value. For an average family a day costs $1500+. You can literally book 2 nights in a 5 star resort in an awesome destination for that.

And your florida residents haha imagine if you had to pay fot the trip out there and hotel cost lol
Just ridiculous amount of money n thats for 1 disney park only! U have what 5-6 different disney parks with separate gate tickets etc etc...i dont think Mr. Disney designed his parks to be expensive like this.
Disney is like a Gucci shirt it’s a designer park
The prices are that high to keep trash out
I stop going to Disneyland.  It's a scam.
Guys,if you exclude airline tickets, with that money, you can spend a week on vacation in the Greek islands.. swimming in blue waters and eating delicious food..
Omg did the tickets price go up to $200 now!! WTH 😩
Think of it as donating to the Disney Foundation. I am sure the money is being put to good use, like making woke DEI movies. Walt would approve.😉
People who complain about the Disney cost can't afford it to begin with.  I suggest go to your county fairs that suit your paltry budgets.
I remember going to Disneyland,Anehaim in 1995 and tickets were $30.
My children and grandchildren never wanted to go the Disney World.  They chose Dollywood every time.
This greedy people charge you all the Disney stuff through out the park every shop same stuff for expensive price !
Why go there to complain about the prices... just dont go.
We could have done without the dig at the Biden presidency.
Key statement - The lines were long
My face is 🤯 🤯 🤯 🤯 😱 😱 😱 😱 😱 😱
Disney has been that way for decades. Not sure how he didn't know that living close to there.
But it's the experience of your children that you want to cherish regardless of the price. To parents it's all about the money but to children it's just the magical feeling being there with their whole family.  So save a lot and go there at least once in your lifetime!
I just looked how much a 1 week Disney World holiday at the end of March 2026 would cost for 1 adult and 1 child (from uk): £6,100 !!!!!!! In 2022 is was £3k!!! That increase is insane! For so much less too!!!
“Most expensive day ever” dad.  Killjoy.
🔥🔥🔥 FCK PEDOISNEY!  Stop giving them your hard-eared money and see how quickly their prices will "magically" drop! You complain they support homosexuality and pedophelia and you continue giving their your money?
It didn’t cost that much at one point! My family and I use to go every year!!! I mean like $45 or $50 a ticket! We use to do mostly everything, crazy how everything has changed and at this point you are rather rich or poor! Smh 🤦🏾‍♀️
When they opened in 1955 an adult ticket was $1.00 and a child was $.50.
If you got to pay to go don’t go imagine cashing out those expenses and holding the cash in hand that is so powerful to keep that money
it’s always been like that baby lmao yet y’all still give disney all y’all money 🤷🏻‍♀️
Dude, the costs are high because you and millions of others paying it. Disney has always been expensive.
Price grow up and it’s not a trip we will make again 😢
If you are dumb enough to support a woke company, shut up and pay!
Our Disney World trip for 4 cost under $50 and that was for food. We used points to fly there. My husband's best friend works there (and ministers to hos coworkers there as one of the few Christians) so he had a family pass for his own family that he let us use.
😂what a tool
Whatever,  he obviously was ok to pay for it so stop bitching.  For my family, we dont spend the money cuz we cant afford it.
IF Disney was smart they would open a new park in Northern California or Texas.  They charge what they charge because people are willing to pay and the park still hits full capacity during summer.  If they actually just opened another park it would ease the congestion of the other 2 and their revenue would increase over 25%
Need to plan better. Went to Disney for way cheaper.
This is a stupid story.  They didn’t plan it.  Being punished?  Please.  Don’t blame Disney for corporate greed,  they charge what the market will bear.  If you don’t like Disney and or can’t afford it don’t go.  They aren’t a charity.   I say YES to WDW
Thats horrible 😞 Disney is the dark side 😂
1400 dollars for only 6 rides due to the waiting times? No, thank you!
If prices were reasonable the park would be 10 times more packed
It should cost more !!  Why?  Because as the family stated it was so packed so people are willing to pay so why not increase the price
Dollywood or Universal all the way…
Dad looking like you better had fun!!!!
Disney been high for years since i was a kid in the 80”s my mom and grandma spend so much on this trip.
Happened to be heading to California for something and decided a stop off at one of the parks might be fun. When I checked, I decided almost $400 for one adult was not fun.
Family of 5…. That’s not bad at all
I never took the kids there and they turned out fine. We always found something to do as a family.
Now add plane tickets if you are from another state, and hotel stay. You can go visit another country/culture, or the beautiful nature many states here in USA has.
The only times I’ve been to Disney land is when a friend or family member works there and I can get in for free 😂
One parking hack for free parking at Magic Kingdom/Animal Kingdom: Tell them you're just dropping "them" off, and they let you through. Then go park.  I noticed this when I when I was just there this past Memorial day, and was legit dropping off someone in the morning as we were sharing rental cars.  That being said, we paid $200 per adult ticket at Magic Kingdom. IMO, I don't think it was worth $200 per head. However, you can buy it as "cheap" as $159 if it's done well in advance. We just were not in the position to do that.
Only the rich ride the rides everyone else waits in line that doesn't move because the speed passes ride only. No time for the peasants!
I just threw up in my mouth. Disney is for the wealthy and the make a wish foundation only!
Waste of money 😮 I better visit another country instead of going to this place. That will be a better experience for my kids.
Next time, go to your local park.
I wii go to Disney and spend $$5000..or More for my grandkids 💰💰💰💕💕
Disney is going out of business...  soon and very soon.
In other news the grass is green
Now it has gotten a little bit better … lol sure not it has not.
Geez,  I'm coming onto this having watched some Onion News Network skits  : it's becoming very hard to tell the difference ....😮
I will never go to that garbage park. Disney is doomed.
Little fyi , universal cost more and their food in the parks is as good as Disney’s . BTW , at Universal parking starts at $32 . I don’t get though , for the last few months Disney been offering 4 day passes at $60 day and you have until the end of September to use them .
I would only go to V&A
People are still going here😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
So glad I went to DW in the 70s, 80s, & 90s. I'll hold on to those great memories.
Pro tip: Check the costs before you book a vacation.
Suckers !!! Never been, Never Will..
Dear Dad ...   You are not a victim: you are a volunteer.  Being a SIMP has consequences.      Spend the money on true adventures: State and National Parks:  Yosemite, Joshua Tree, Glacier, etc.  Touch grass.  Feel the Sun. Swim the water.  Breath the air.  Rinse. Repeat.
It is so unfortunate that, even though Disney is located in America, for some families, it remains only a dream for their children to visit Disney.
WDW has all their fees posted. You weren’t that surprised dude. He looks like DeSantis. Ha.
They couldn't pay me to go!
Disney is proof a fool and his money are soon departed.
Currently at disney world watching this. Let me tell you you're essentially paying 5 grands to stand in line. I'd rather the beach to relax
Take your family to the beach then.
That’s how wage suppression works my guy. When wage growth is stagnant in the interest of corporate profits long enough, this is what happens. I bet he loves that Union busting on top of it 😂
This is I never been or will go to Disney it’s not affordable.
people like him will keep prices up, complaining but still following, my kid is 10 and has never been to disney land, not because we cant afford it but because we hate wat disney stands for, he has been to most lakes, parks, states with great American history.
......not like its a necessity ......you chose to go
Ngl you went to Disneyland with a family of literal 5 people, how much you thought you was gon spend?
Imagine booking an highly overpriced vacation just to tell everybody it's overpriced. 👍
"Parking rates at Navy Pier in Chicago vary based on time of day and how long you stay, but generally cost between $18-$60 per day. For shorter stays, it might cost $18 for 0-59 minutes, $32 for 1-2 hours, and $37 for 2-5 hours, according to Navy Pier. For longer stays, the rate increases to $45 for 5-12 hours, $55 for 12-18 hours, and $60 for 18-24 hours."  $30 for parking isn't bad. This guy is just entitled and clearly doesn't take his family out very often.
Shocking breaking news Disneyland is expensive 😂duh just like everyone wins money in Vegas how do you think they built those huge buildings on wishes
I mean is 5 people and you go eat at a restaurant there? 👀
You know it's bad when theme parks cost the same as rent
Start @ 2:15 and then look to the dude on the right when she finishes!
I thought it was going to be like above 3k or something
This was not Walt Disney Dream for his parks😢 I grew up 20 mintues from Disneyland, we used coupon books😂ABC and D rides sucked
Disney will take that money and Trans your child!! Not my money
actually thats not too bad for a family of 5.
People need to stop going to all these expensive places it’s not worth it at all…
$1400 on one day is not relatable 😂 to who?
I never went to Disney as a child, and I’ve never felt like I missed anything.
The last time my family of 3 went to Disneyland, our stay for 5 days costed over 5k, including hotel costs. This was in 2012. Can't imagine the cost now.
I recently went its absurd how they want to charge to cut a line i told myself i wont be paying because thats why they keep it people STOP PAYING
Absolutely NOT worth it, Disney is just a HYPE, it’s high time world REALIZE this!!!
Yes you knew how much before you went and you still went. So why you bitching 🤡 😢
My kids would hate me cuz I won’t pay for that.
That price is insane! I can go to SPBGMA for 4 days and stay at the hosting hotel for less than that (about $1100).
Disney is RIPOFF ....  stay away
Only a fool would pay that!
None of these "amusement parks" are worth it. When people stop accepting worthless entertainment the world would be a better place. Like my old 1st Sgt used to say "pull your head out of your a**". Disney is worth nothing but contempt.
Thanks Trump
If you can afford it go.  Have a great time.   If not go do something else in the budget
Going virile.   Do not not go.
That’s nothing it cost me with hotel and air tickets for 4 people around $9k for only 3 days and 2 days park
Hell no.
Wait…. It’s over 150 bucks per person per DAY to get in?
Disney needs a competitor.   Unfortunately, they have a monopoly on the movie/theme park set up.
Disney land is no longer worth it
That's nothing compared to taking a family of 5 to an NFL game!!
You now have to mortgage your house to pay for a Disney experience.
Disney preys on naive parents who’ve never been to Orlando who get suckered into marketing tactics that make it seem like you suck as a parent if you don’t take them to Disney world
Really? This is news? lolol
I am proud to say that I visited Disney World for the last time a week ago, and I did it begrudgingly at the request of my wife.  Well, after spending $989 for dinner (party of 10 adults and 2 kids) I realized it is not worth the hassle and stress of visiting this once beautiful and innocent park, now corrupt by greed and wokeness.  BTW, this "last time" also refers to movies, TV shows and merchandise.  Having said this, we are planning a trip to Universal!!!!
The insane cost of Disney starts with California liberal stupidity. But it doesn't end there.
Just got back and it just keeps getting more and more depressing on watching the parks continue to digress into disrepair and the lack of cleanliness!  My annual pass expires Aug 1. and I will swap it for a Universal pass for the next year. The Magic is gone and it shows within the parks!
I feel his pain 😂😂
Middle class no longer welcome. And it's not just Disneyland. It's everything
Maybe he’s posting to get a little money back from the trip. Lol
Can’t complain about optional expenses
I don’t understand why they need to charge people for parking. That’s a crime in itself. Are they parking your car for you? Sheesh.
No shizzz
He obviously put this on a credit card and didn’t pay attention to the fact that it’s not 2001 anymore.
I live 30 minutes away, and wouldn't go if it were free.
My daughter and husband saves all year for passes so they can make this worth it. They go 4-5 times and stay in a hotel away from the park. I can't afford to meet them there at my age. My granddaughter always wants Granny D to go but i just can't afford it 😢
In europe we are cluttered up with castles ,can hardly move for them, fun parks we got them as well. Nowhere near the prices quoted.
"What's the matter pappy you dont have sixty nine thousand dollars?" - Walt Disney
y’all making this kid feel really guilty though
So many people complaining it’s always been this way ….and it’s a fun park if you don’t wanna pay the price simply don’t ….i will be going back this year my kids had a blast last year
Ya, Disney is dizzy. it's just a foregone source of entertainment that isn't worth it any longer
He told her to say that answer
There is a lot to do in Florida, if you choose Disney get ready to pay
disney is a waste of money, you cant even walk 😒😒
Why is he shocked?
It's always been overpriced and I have never even been
Anyone thats a florida resident knows disney is way over priced and out dated
Disney is a rip off.
People getting shocked and offended at the cost. Charging them with greed. It’s called sup and demand people. Get a grip.
Thanks trump!!!!!!
I wonder how much the Micky Ears cost??? 100 bucks???
well he failed his children...i would gone somewhere else disney sucks
Could  not pay me to  go
So expensive Disney in HK
Yeah sorry I don’t have any sympathy for this dad.  Disney is a luxury.  A choice.  You knew the prices before you left.  Yes they are gouging everyone.  No doubt.  Americans act so entitled that they deserve to have everything on the cheap.  Employees have to be paid.  Grounds have to be maintained.  People need to make a profit.  Your a small business owner.  Your not overcharging someone a bit?
I said it once and I will say it a million times, my week's stay at Disney world in FL ( Grand Floridian and the Animal Kingdom) was the biggest waste of money, time and patience.   Long lines with the worst people (tons of obese folks in scooters and trash) over priced crap food, and boring entertainment parks.   Everyone looked miserable.   Never ever again.   Will check out Universal bc it has the monsters park now.
Somebody has to pay for those crap movies they keep trying to make.
$900 for 5. Hard pass.
No problem...Just stop facility Disney Parks.
Take your kid on a cruise for a week...it's cheaper.
Why does anyone go to Disney anymore? It's full of pedos. Ran by pedos.
I long ago came to the conclusion that the Disneyland/Disney World I remember no longer exists.
THIS IS NOTHING! My brother in law his wife and 2 kids from Canada 🇨🇦 spent 6000$ every summer for years to go to Disney! And she didn’t even work! Just insane!
Aw, Kendall is so sweet!    I think any park – theme park, national park, whatever – should meter the maximum amount of people in the park, so your time is enjoyable while there.
0:40  Guy's got his YT channel shirt and sign on the wall, using his kids to make money as a "creator"... Sickening.
I've known people that go every year!  There's so much more to do in Florida instead of giving all your money to a liberal corporation.
Idiot deserves it.  I would never take my kids to such a woke theme park.  Even if it was free.
6 flags is better and a lot cheeper
Welcome to inflation.  It goes back to government printing money.  BYW, we like the Grand Floridian hotel at Disney World the week after Thanksgiving.   It is cool, short lines, Christmas decorations.  Disney is quality.
100% if your going to the theme parks bring a good supply of lube because they going to bend you over every chance they get ..  worlds biggest tourist trap ..

Disneyland tickets in California for the months of June and July are $250 for someone over the age of 10 and still over $200 for someone under 10.
Did you expect it to be cheap?
I wouldn't take my child or grandchild to Disney even if you gave me thousands and thousands of dollars.
“It’s gotten a little bit better” 😅
Disney is disgusting and perverted now, it is terrible to see
Disneyland buildings are fake. It's a front. Windows are made smaller to make the building appear larger.
just save money take your kids somewhere better...
She sat up there and lied saying its gotten a little bit better from the last administration… Fox and the Republicans are spineless liars
For a day at Disney it shouldn't be much over 100 dollars.
What a fool. Never taking my children to Disney. It's a waste, And Disney is evil.
Pay $1400 to hear that the thing she loved the most was waiting in line 😂
This guy is a straight cheapstake he got a great deal 1,500 for 5 everyone drank,ate,abd got a souvenir dude wanted 80's prices stop going 2 Disneyland if U can't afford it (PERIOD)
😅😅😅😅
just too many people love Disney, it’s unfortunate, even if prices got lower,  the place would now be even more crowded.
Disney's the least of it. Most americans can't go to a baseball game, concert or travel nationally.
2:15 Sorry, but what country is she living in as Walmart and others are hiking prices as this airs??
It’s so boring. Never going there again. Complete rip off for mediocre fun.
30$ to park Thats a crime ritght there😂
We recently went to a fair in town tickets were $13 each for a family of 5 plus $35 each for wristband kids only $60-$80 for food plus snacks. We spent about $300. Seemed like a lot because we usually only have money left for food. To us it was a great experience to take out our kids and have a bit fun.

Im going with my family to  disney world and Universal we are spending almost 4k and that's not food or anything yet
My family as a family of 4. Going to Disneyland Paris  for 2  days cost us  about 400
Doesn't America have 100s of theme parks? Leave the Disney parks to the weirdos.
Do tips included?
They only need two toys not 30! And besides one day is enough who needs a week.
I’ll just stick with Disneyland.
Gotta pay for that DEI  wokeness somehow to indoctrinate kids
When Disneyland in California first opened (yes, I am old), my husband was an enlisted Navy seaman third class and I was a stay-at-home mom.  We were able to take our one-year-old there for the day and had a great time — on his minimal wages!  Instead of being the Magic Kingdom, Disney has become the Major Scam!  That dad would have done better to take his kids to a state or national park!
all that money and they cant come up with one original creative thought. Much less make a remake of an old movie that honors the original.
Even working there is worse in other ways
My daughter works there I can go for free an will not go for the over crowds an nonsense
Demon Corporation. Keep yer children away. God Bless. 🙏
No
Ridiculous! Most theme parks are the same. Is it worth it? Hell NO!
I will never pay the outrageous prices to go to Disney
We live 40 minutes from Disney and due to cost, long line, and other things we have not been to Disney for years.  Disney lives on tourist and care little for those that live near the park.
Go to UNIVERSAL
Go to europe! Waaaay better
Believe brother!
I long ago came to the conclusion that the Disneyland I remember no longer exists. It’s not just the money (which is bad enough), it’s their curious lack of care for the details. Walt Disney himself would be furious over the greed which taints their parks.    Here was Disney’s mantra: These are not “customers”…these are our “GUESTS”, treat them as such! Now who would EVER charge their ”guests” $30 to park their car?
Dad spent $1,400 for his adolescent daughter to stand in line and talk to strangers. Talk about culture.
I recently took my daughter to Disney on ice and even that was expensive. The plushies and other things were at least 30 dollars. A small plush doll was 30 and the bigger size plush doll was 60. A Disney popcorn was 20 dollars. I love Disney but not their prices.
If you can't afford it, don't go.
Just as well that people is starting to realize that Disney is not worth it. Disney has been rinsing people for the longest time so its about time we started bringing this to light
Funny how this guy’s shocked by Disney prices, but doesn’t connect the dots. Sky-high costs and corporate greed didn't pop up out of nowhere—Trump’s tax cuts for billionaires and DeSantis’ petty war on Disney haven’t exactly helped working families. Maybe if these two spent less time grandstanding and more time protecting consumers, a family vacation wouldn’t cost a second mortgage.
PEDOland/PEDOworld should be permanently closed. Those places are evil.
Thank God we live close to Gatlinburg and Dollywood parks  and we don’t have to go to disney and spend that whole lot of money
You get what you pay for & you definitely paid a lot for the opportunity to sit on one of those donut cushions because Disney definitely gave it to you! Enjoy!
Ain't affording that in Trump's economy
As a single mom, I was blessed my parents paid for my daughter’s Disneyland birthday trip when she was 5. I never would have been able to afford it.
Obviously you could afford it. Fox victim mentality like Disney made them pay lol
How many rides did they go on?
I thought it was gonna be worse. But it’s still a bit too much.
lol I’ve paid that for two. Disney has always been overpriced. It’s tauted as a resort. Actually for 5 ppm I’m surprised he didn’t pay closer to 3000$.
Disney didn't pay the news mafia network and thus got a hit piece on them.
Islands of adventure and universal are better
People already living fake lives you might as well go here and maximize the fake to a new level.
What do you expect they have to pay the performer's all the bills you need to understand c'mon now don't complain
Disney has gotten too expensive thats why there losing   woke Disney isnt worth it
Since Disney's left turn into laughable DUI, their brand has been descending like a lead brick in water!
It is sad how expensive it is considering how many people go there per day. They would still make money hand over fist if the prices were lower. It’s just greed!
my dad said our family trip to ITALY was nearly the same price as disney
Almost $1,500 and they are FOR INDOCTRINATING your children in agenda alphabet.... boycott.
We will most likely never be able to afford to bring our only child to Disney. He's almost 12 and autistic.     I've only been once in 1996 but most of the rides and places we went into were so dark. Our son is so scared of darker places so a lot of things we could do would be instantly ruled out. I think he would still love to go just to walk around and see all of the different things but with the insane and ridiculous costs of everything I sadly just can't make it make sense to spend that much just to go walk around.      I hope the people who set these prices are ashamed of themselves and if not they should be!!! They are stealing from families that do go and also stealing opportunities for families and children that will never get to go simply because of their greed for money. It's literally disgusting and honestly hurts my heart. 😡😢😢
Biden’s fault. When trump becomes president everything will be great. Or so I was told😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nope. We like to have groceries.
He spent 1,400 bucks for his daughter to say her favorite experience was waiting in line talking to her family.  😮   I tell ppl all the time of you genuinely enjoy the ppl you are around it shouldn’t matter what you guys do .
Republicans want anything amazing to be available only to the rich
I couldn’t imagine paying those kinds of prices for a park. I’m lucky enough to have been able to go in the early 70’s and I can’t imagine how much it was then but I’m thinking dad paid 50$ a ticket for him and my brother and I, which I’m sure was quite a bit back then , my favorite thing was the place where they took you back in time and into the future with modern conveniences and some I remember are or have been mass produced since then!! Onee we specific thing I remember was the “electronic babysitter “ I’m pretty sure it’s like the baby monitors.
If ppl stood together snd just stopped going or buying certain things then companies would have no choice but to lower .. they dont care about our complaining or words, our actions and dollar is what they listen to.  Ppl are so powerful TOGETHER no wonder they want us fighting each other snd competing.
Disney is one of the worst and most evil corporations in existence. Boycott them. Cancel them. Delete them all together.
Cancel Disney all together!!!
Some traditions are made to be broken.. down with disney
Your daughter only needs two dolls, your son doesn't need a light saber!!  What are you, some kinda liberal communist?  MAGA!!
Is it worth it? ...... Duuuuuh yeah!!! She ain't paying for it, lol ..... smh
The dad knew how expensive disney was before he got there he just clout chasing
The payment goes to funding western agenda, to promote LGBT 😛
The daughter had fun and enjoyed spending time with the family, which is the point. People love Disney and are willing to pay for the memories. But people also love to complain about the long lines and crowds. Lowering the price would only make it MORE crowded! Also, this guy got just a one-day ticket, which will always be the most expensive option. I think he did that just to be able to complain about how expensive it is and get attention, which worked. If he couldn’t have afforded it, he wouldn’t have done it. Disney offers promotional 3/4-day tickets during less busy times that work out much less per day. Yes, it’s still expensive, but this is still America and we still have a capitalist market economy. Like so many commenters have said, if you don’t like the price, don’t go. Plain and simple.
That daughter's response was so sweet
He's a business owner, and has a play button from YouTube so miney there too.  Yet he's complaining about spending money? (To be fair, stay frugal homie, it's just cringe when he's better off than most and conplaining)
1:15 First time? 😂  How is this man older than me 😂😂😂😂
Its just entertainment, which means you dont have to be there
What a disgrace for a day trip. As someone mentioned below... it IS corporate greed.
Why would anyone support Disney?
Don't have a family of 5
This idiot choose to go and pay their ridiculous prices. Self inflicted pain, just like your Trump Tariffs 😂
Don't go no one's forcing u
I have never been to Disneyland and it’s in my bucket list. However, I’m pretty sure the magic of the experience that went with it way back when is gone. Not too sure about going anymore.😢
Kids will have fun any where it’s up to you to make it fun.
Disneyland 👎
What did you expect dude
never been to Disney and don't plan on it lmao
Disney is super greedy.....organization of satan
ive never been able to go for a reason lol
Yup! Our family of 4 went to Disney last summer and spent close to that. Ridiculous!
And how much of that day was spent actually on the rides and having fun? Say about 20/30 minutes? More?
I would love to go to Disney buuuuut I like to eat and pay my bills too. That’s why I quit going to six flags in Texas . Too expensive and I hated standing in line for an hour for a five minute or less ride . And talk about over crowded.
I thought the “news” was supposed to be “new” information. This has been happening for years and nobody is surprised
Just send me that money if you’re gonna waste it on Disney
Dad didn’t do any research lol. I’ve always wanted to go to Disney land, but that doesn’t mean I could afford it even as an adult..
People first off guy said it was a last minute thing. The only way to save money when going to disney world is the plan ahead. For what he spent you could probably book a hotel and a buffet as well as eat snacks when out and only spend half that amount. Now because you have to pay for fast pass things will cost more. Before if you plan ahead the fast pass was free.
Breaking news:  Disney is expensive but fun.
Raised her right
If the cost were lower, more people would visit and the lines would be even longer.
Pay $1000+ only to wait in line for half of the day
oh hell no
That's his fault for going there, no one told you to go there, no one forced his family to spend that money. Stop blaming others for your decision
Already accepted the fact that my family will never be able to afford this
Ummmm. Nothing new. Been complaining about this for years.
Boycott Disney!  What a complete joke!! 😮
Disney is an American woke, joke. Why would anyone support them?
I bet it would be a lot more had they stayed a night in the hotel there.
There’s a smart way to visit Disney World:  Bring your own food and eat outside of the park grounds.  Don’t purchase anything from the gift shops (the novelty wears off quickly and they become just another object on the pile)  Don’t pay for anything in the park at all except for the tickets.   Stay at a reasonably priced hotel or air b & b nearby.   Think outside of the “I have to travel like a typical American” box.
Little girl “Oh yeah I’d say it’s worth it but…” 😂
Not Worth it! 😮 The Only 1:30  bragging rights you have, is You can tell you co-workers that you went to Disney World, and Got Legally Robbed 😮 Your An Idiot!😂
I have no sympathy for people stupid enough to fall into that ‘greedy’ trap! And the Disney Corporation is laughing all the way to the band thanking SUCKERS like you!
You couldn’t PAY me to go to that place!! It’s the biggest, greediest scam in all of America! And people who do go there and PAY those insane costs are FOOLS!
Your stupidity means nothing to me. I think you need to look at your priorities.
"It's gotten a little bit better."‽
Woke Disney what did you expect??
No sympathy.  You should have been aware of the outrageous Disney prices. Everyone knows this. Stop patronizing Disney!!! Otherwise,  deal with it: Don't complain.
Terribly lines, terrible prices, and they loved it!?!
Want to save money go to Lowes and let your kids sit on the riding lawnmower and eat stale candy cost a lot less
I go there all the time and guess what people like you keep paying that’s why they do extremely well and I’ll be there next week probably spend three times that easily in one day with my crew
It’s just a monopoly. They don’t care about the people.
Disney is Satanic wake up!!!
Why don't you give me the money I'll take you guys for a ride like Disneyland could never do
I feel so sorry for people think they have to spend that kind of money to have fun
I’m $800 into one Disneyland day for 2….and not even there yet. Happiest Place On Earth? Decades ago but not today.
So, you went to Disney World, and you didn't know how much it was going to cost you? Really? You're the first adult I have ever heard of who doesn't research costs before going on a vacation or setting a budget.
So glad my parents refused to take our family to disney growing up, and instead, took us to almost all 50 states and out of the country before I was out of high school.  The brain rot I see from people that have gone to disney since they were kids to adults is wild.
Why would even want to go to such a place?...Especially considering that Mr Disney was p**oph*le🤣👹👁
Disney killed all the other parks. Make more to entertain the masses then
Let the fool splurge, keep working
Stop going it's that simple.
Ticket prices should include parking prices
F disney....disneyland evil and dark side of it....and yet yall disney fans dumb a$$es dont know. Trafficking scouts inside and outside the park and kid napping,etc,...........
😂
They are financing these trips.  It has been going on for a long time but the prices were never this high.  When you are brought up where parents just swipe the card then you are more likely to do the same but you have to remember cost have gone up while wages haven't so alot of these trips are benefitting the banker.   The life of our economy no where resembles the one of our parents so please think before the swipe.
With those ears you deserve all of it
Have it
Complaining about it while you choose to go is rhetorical...they didnt force you to go nor require to be there to have fun  Be outside in the park, go camping, enjoying a walk, those are free!
Walt Disney must be turning in his grave
Dad cheap! to be honest if you have kids have fun! With them because the only kids once you can’t be putting price on their heads!
He wouldn’t have this problem with he did some research and plan ahead a little bit
Dont have kids
Disney Certified Travel Specialist here 🎉 I can book you the greatest Disney trip At the airport and best price! 😊
What really winds me up is that they charge for parking. I would not even think of going.
Stop complaining, buy the tickets or don't go lol
that actually not bad for that many people. Enjoy it man
Well.....if you can afford it, you really should not complain.  There are plenty of low cost options for a fun family day with the kids.  As your child said, spending time with the family is what was most important to her.
That's crazy
Greedy Disney🤑 💰
First they squander 100s of millions on bad movie remakes, then they try to recuperate their losses by charging families all they have for the experience of cheap food, long lines in the baking sun, and rides that are actually just lousy roller coasters with lots of production design that has usually long since been culturally outdated... Disney, it's time to grow out of your villain phase.
Take your kids into nature instead - the beauty is healing and the experience leaves an impression for life.
I will never go nor take my kids to this depressing  place
Right can't afford it
Well yea, they gotta try and recoup financial losses for all the garbage movies they keep making 🤑🤑🤑
I prefer to go to Disneyland Tokyo. It's $70 for adults and $35 for kids. That's crazy...
I liked  being with my family and talking to them all the time!  Thats  all what most  kids want!❤
People still supporting Dismay, after all of the B$ they represent and their agendas, is just crazy.
Disney prices aren't a secret.  Your fault for not doing research - a few clicks on the Disney site reveals ALL the cost.  One more whiny Florida Man, I guess.
Then why go? Are you that addicted to a company? Go take a walk down a natural trail, there are literally hundreds in Florida alone, and it's free.
Not to mention you can get nicer lightsabers that you can actually hit together for a better value
Dad forgot to check theres extra 0 on disney trip total costs
And don't forget the alligators.
Nope
Maybe this place is probably not so family friendly at all
Boycott Disney and all holdings they use your children to finance the destruction of this country
Well looks like I will never go to that place   Waste of time for me  to many dam. People any way👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿
Disney and zoos are overrated
Go to the beach. Way more fun.
My wife and I are newly retired.  We can absolutely afford Disney World, or Epcot, Sea World, or the Movie Theme Parks.   But we absolutely refuse to give up our money that easily.  Then as Conservative People we do our best to avoid that ideology.  Walt Disney must be spinning in his grave.
I cant belive people still giving money to this satanic company.
A fantastic no bulls*** article that people connected with
it hasnt gotten better . we are spending more for food than ever.  thats the only thing i wanted to go down with the trump admin.  food is an ongoing monthly bill and we spend triple per month since Joe  "the joke" Bide, but have seen no relief from trump yet either.  All other costs arent mandatory, but food is. that, coupled with the fact that there are several NEW lifetime utilities  (ex. internet, cell phones), not to mention the rediculous cost of hospitals and all other insurances that are mandatory to have , but it is thier choice to pay. are we sure the USA is not already a communist country. we even have political propaganda in schools and movies just like North Korea. you used to be able to be a kid and have fun at least through high school before you were thrown into this country.  we are no longer america.  PLEASE FIX THIS!!! .  This is what happened at the end of all great nations in the past ( Rome for example). how can so many of our leaders be fighting over making the country better. it should be everyones priority. My gender, sexual orientation, religion and personal life are none of the governments business.  There should just be equal laws for ALL, its that simple.
America Comes First
Well it’s a family of five what would you expect 600$ bro it’s 2025 it cost like 500$ to be outside 🤨🤨🤨
Why going to Disney’s Abu Dhabi theme park may actually be cheaper than visiting Disney World in Orlando? BTW, the Abu Dhabi theme park is the most high tech modern disney theme park in the world.
Disney is a ridiculous money suck.
Yes things are expensive but why cry and complain on a family outing while wearing the mouse ears???
That’s ridiculous..
My mom just got back today...they are $8 for a bottle of water in the park....😂😂
@2:24 it's gotten a little better...For who!!!
What a jerk. The money is spent, why ruin your kids memory? Saying it wasn't worth it in front of them. Sickening.
U are dumb, 3 of us 7 days 4500 and that all the parks
Of course, there are people who keep paying  those prices, it is a waste of money and time ( 45 minutes standing in line ) . Our society is full of parents that promotes this type of waste. These kids will continue contributing to the pockets of all Disney investors. The world will benefit if the priorities were somewhere else (like saving for college and investing in community activities)
Media is blaming anger at Tariffs for steep drop in Canadian visits to theme parks. These people were Florida residents, so discounted tickets, lived locally, so no airfare, car rental or accommodation. Then it costs 1.43 Canadian for each US dollar we spend. So next time you hear we are staying home because of tariffs, you know that is not the only reason. And even a day trip to shop is no longer worthwhile, especially here on the west coast where prices in WA have gone up a lot so can actually be more expensive with exchnge
Is this the park where bunch of dudes with beard dressed up as Disney princesses?
Boohoo in my shoe
Can’t PAY me to go to Disney. Won’t fund their woke BS!! 😝
If you don't have the money, don't go.
Disney and Universal raise there ticket prices every year . In 1975 a Disney ticket cost 6.00$
$1400 you could’ve gone on a week cruise and had a lot more fun and saw cooler stuff. Disney is overrated.
I have less than 1 percent interest in going there 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
No 💩 Sherlock. Disney has been exorbitantly expensive for decades. It's a luxury theme park. Why is this on the news?
Disney now is just a once in a lifetime thing. I say save up and do it at least one time as a family just for the experience and after that never do it again. Go camping instead!
Can't believe they went there in the first place. No research on what it would cost? You get what you deserve. Disney will never get a $1 from me.
It was his “literal hell” but still went there and paid all the money they asked.
you pay for a safe place, clean as hell place and for the Experience.  took me 20 years to go 2 times.
Universal is better and way more affordable
If this Dad only knew how badly Disney is brainwashing his kids.  Smh
That is absolutely ridiculous,  BIG NOPE 😮
No Kidding!!! Hundreds to just get into Epcot Europe village, 2 rides were down, food overrated and expensive, pay for parking, totally not worth it.
That's why i have never been to Disney world! 😢😮
See when your single you ain’t got these problems 😂
Not bad for one time experience for the whole family
1391 is my rent before utilities.
I live in FL. Haven’t been to Disneyworld in 10 years and have no intention to go back.  Prefer state and national parks.
Corporate greed  at it's  finest ! F that place .
Lol😂 she couldn't wait to throw that dig at the last administration but reality is it's happening now
stay home
Yeah well, all Disney resorts had to adjust their price due to Trumphs f*kn around with the U.S. economy. And if going out costs too much, just stay home and explore your back yard, get to know your neighbors and touch grass for once. 😊
You could go to somewhere natural for a WEEK with your family and enjoy the family bonding together and magnificent local food for what it costs to go to Disney for a DAY.  There are state and national parks, historical districts and thousands of other options, where there are no crowds and no price gouging.  All it takes is a couple hours of research and a quick plan.
If I have kids… I would never bring them there
Walt Disney would be upset by this.
“Under the last administration” are you kidding me. Trump is an idiot. And prices are still high … Fox stop acting like Trump is going to bring prices day. No company is going to lower prices … prices are here to stay
Did anyone not know this? I know people that spent 10 K in Disney.
Maybe your tariff cheque will help pay for it???
Disney going broke on their WOKE movies and that is why they have to do something with their dead park.
Think about the amount of money they lost in that trash snow white movie they gotta up something lol
Boycott Israhell  don't go to these places
Haha! Fox almost made Trump angry until they went back to blaming the old administration. So funny. When will Trump take any responsibility? Never. We all know it. He's a big, fragile orange pewter puff, propped up by Fox. $1400 is a brand new wide screen TV, or a good basic stock investment. Crazy prices, and nothing to do with Biden. If people stopped going for just one week, immediately the prices would fall.
You couldn’t pay me to even go there with all the people. It doesn’t even look fun.
Good on fox for bringing this to viewers...I have loved Disneyland since I was a kid and have always wanted to bring my son there...unfortunately its just not in the cards with prices like this..especially with the exchange rate. I guess the McDonald's play place will have to do 😢
If he carries a balance, that trip will continue to cost a ton.
No longer can a lower working-class kid able to go to Disneyland like they used to.  So sad.
I've been to Magic Kingdom back in August 2019 and it was nuts waiting in line for brief rides but the arm and leg cost of each park admission is insane! Not to mention there is darkness of what happens to the innocence who go missing so it's not worth the hassle!
This the onion?
It's like showing one guy complaining about expensive golf club fees. 🎉😂
Why is he shocked??? It was $200 10 years ago when we went and parking was actually more
$45 for a light sabre?  And people are buying them?  Sure they are!  That’s why they can charge $45 for something worth 50 cents from China!
😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Lol I'm glad someone's finally talking about it
Really Faux host? The cost of groceries has gotten better since the last administration??? How??? Still seeing the same prices as before clueless lady….
In the late 80s to early 90s my mother and her family would pay $30 or $35 per Disneyland ticket in Anaheim California and parking was very cheap, they would go often. It’s crazy how the prices for Disney theme parks have increased so much, it’s out of control.
...and we're all trying to pinch pennies 😅
Clowns.... waste of time and money.
The guy steals money from people by selling them crap used cars he gets from the auction - I'm glad he got ripped off
Gotten a little bit better??
I refuse to go to Disney, with the same money I can go to a whole other country for longer than a day.
I think it's like triple that in California Disney lol
Its sad some kids w o nt be able to afford it, i went in the 5th grade,i n loved the small world😊
Yall keep paying for it so yeah. They’re gonna keep charging for it. STOP GOING TO DISNEY!
People drag their kids there still😂
Dude. Disney World is fun. Lots of parks and things to do. It's definitely not cheap but worth the money. We tend to do more camping andNational Park trips, but with a nine year old meeting all of her Disney friends and Dad (me) hugging Chewbacca and meeting Mandalorian, again worth the cash. You only live once and the walking is best done while young. Just plan a bit and you can go cheaper than this. Also he is a family of 5. We are 3.
Giggle. Paying out a bi.lion to stand in line with five billion other people.  Giggles  😊😊😊
Sadly, Disney has become a cash cow for nothing more than liberal agendas now.
Idiocracy 😂😆🤣
Disney is too demanding. No matter how much we complain about it being too expensive, people always find a way to save and make it work. That being said Disney is like "these people keep showing up, we gonna keep the prices high". In a sense we do this to our selves. Think about it, if your running a business and you keep seeing people show up, your also going to keep prices high. If you raise the prices even higher and still see people showing up, your not gonna make it cheaper, you gonna keep the prices up. If they really want to help the people, they need to build more Disney parks around the US to keep one or 2 parks from being in so much demand. Otherwise prices will never go down.
Ppl always say a child needs to experience Disney world, THATS THE BIGGEST BS, Disney should be demolished
After choosing actors for famous roles and those actors openly dislike the fanbase causing a net loss for said movies; they have to make the money up somewhere.
Brokies
I don’t think Kindle really enjoyed it.
And the people who works there don’t make enough to rent a room. They are homeless
I hope my family don’t force me to go there. It will shorten my life by 10 years.
It is an investment for stupidity
DISNEY IS SATAN. STAY AWAY FROM DISNEY. STOP MAKING THESE ELITE. FREEMASON. PEDOS  RICH!!
I miss the REAL Disney.
I really wish Disney would just leave my city and go somewhere else…I hate that so many people continue to come to Orlando
First world problems
Rumor has it that they were about to drop the prices until you and the hundreds that paid that day made them change their mind
She threw in the cost of things being more expensive in the last administration. News flash. It’s more now under this administration.
Imagine spending all your extra money for the year in one day...😢
I used to skip school and go to Disney World when I was a kid in the late 80s and early 90s it was cheap back then, but I will never pay todays prices its not worth it not even close.
It has gotten  worst ..not better
I will NEVER go to Disney with my kids, they can survive without the experience. The place is a money pit, I get the father being upset about the cost. He’s now gotta go back home try to work hard again to make up for that burn in his wallet….totally get it! I wouldn’t put my husband through this. The money could be applied towards so many other things like a trip somewhere else for an entire week versus just one day.
I just came from Disney and I have to tell you it’s expensive yes but think about it…they have to pay the workers, pay for maintenance on all the rides and attractions, everything moving and working thing at Disney costs. And it’s only $30 to park if you didn’t stay on one of their resorts. I stayed at disneys music city resort and the parking is free. We also went to blizzard beach and it’s free to get in if your on the resort. Idk, I don’t complain about it because there are so many moving parts, it makes sense why it’s that way but I promise you will have a good time and it’s worth every penny.
Disney has been robbing people for years.  Just because they Can . People are fools paying those prices
Rip off
We stayed in the Disney resort for a family of 5 for a week and it was really nice but I do agree it is expensive. My oldest son enjoyed it a lot especially the Tron roller coaster 🎢. The only thing I didn’t get to do which I plan to do next time is golf in the Disney resort golf course.
This is cheap
Yeah, it was so much worse under the previous administration when the Stock Market was up 24% two years in a row for the first time in thirty years.  This hack president doesn't even acknowledge his sworn duty to uphold the constitution and is trying to take away Habeus Corpus!  Go google it, Trumpies, and you can learn what that is!
Thank Goodness my two children never asked about Disneyland or showed any interest 😅  I really never seen the purpose behind it…lol   There are so many things you can do with your family in Orange County without having to throw hundreds of dollars.
That is just freaking insane. I hope Disney stock goes to $10 this week on Wednesday.
Love this content. Dad, keep doing what you do! I know it’s costly but those memories will last a lifetime.  And I too hate the cost of Disney lol
Everyone knows the Disney trip/cruises are a rip off. You go for the experience. We all know how expensive it is. This isn’t news. Don’t go! 🤷🏽‍♀️
30 dollar parking. He wouldn't like Seattle
He went above & beyond for his kids! Great father!
Save you money and travel to another country.
My girlfriend has said before, Go to Disney or send your kid to college (??). 😩
My girlfriend just came to USA to live here, she hated the whole Disney experience, and she loves Disney everything but the lines the nasty food and everything so crazy expensive was not worth it, if I was paying this much is to be able to have a good time and have time for everything but it never happens.
Kendall's a good kid - you can tell that was from the heart.
Disney is a ripoff !!!
Someone has to pay for those horrible Disney movies, I know it’s not going to be me!
So you need at least $1500 a day at Disney World.
I will never visit Disney again .
PURE GREED!
He could ate somewhere cheaper and bought the lightning pass
Everyone knows how expensive Disney parks are.  It's a once in a lifetime adventure. You have a family of 5.  Not a bad price if you break it down per person. Everyone goes to Disney, so long lines are to be expected. Be in the moment.  Think of it as family fun.
The best thing was waiting in line....??? God bless you and your families Aloha and amen
It is ridiculously expensive and this is just the beginning, in a few years only top earners wd afford it. At this point is just cheaper to travel overseas to a nice resort
Disney opens a new development park in Dubai.... Disney is now for the rich and goes to show what working class you and the rest of the world belongs to.
The Rat is a Ripp Off!
Stop going.
Umm first thing if you are a Florida resident you should be doing the annual pass in some form. Second you have to plan to go Disney you always had to. I guess the price is now hitting some of the more privileged citizens😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣oh he fafo😂😂😂 😂😂
This is sad because many kids wish they could go to Disney world   Just costs too much
You couldn’t pay me to go!
Nope. I'm good 👍
Go to museums, national and state parks! Learn something AND have fun for a reasonable price! OR spend that Disney money on a trip to a different country for a few days. Expose yourself to a different culture
Parks are packed. Making things more expensive means less people and fewer crowds. Fewer crowds means more enjoyable experience and less waiting in line.
When I went to disneyland in California, I spent 9/10 of the time standing in line. It was not worth it. Never went back.
Companies charge what people are willing pay. It's our fault.
The corporate heads of Disney are harvesters of sorrow! Millions of families can never afford their relentless greed! Leaving millions of disappointed children left out. Everything there is out there has become only for the well to do. I went to play the poor mans sport of bowling the other day, and it was $20 per game! $18 for a tiny pitcher of draft beer! $8 for a freakin hot dog!  I dropped my ball and shoes off at the Goodwill store on my way home! Never again!
So that’s why my Disney stock’s been climbing… Let’s go! Full disclosure: I’ve never even been to Disney, but I hold a significant amount of shares. Big thanks to all of you—Penn State. Thanks you too. That’s four years of tuition covered, courtesy of Disney stock.
I agree...this is crap...Disney is getting very expensive for families...n fir the day...👎👎👎👎
That’s why it’s called a “vacation/tourist spot”. They’re never cheap.
I went there years ago and won't go back. It isn't all that!   Also, the greed of these people is BS. Note below! That money should have been a pay increase for the hard-working employees.   ***** In Disney's fiscal year 2018, Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Iger's total compensation rose to $65.6 million, an increase of 80% from the previous year. This significant increase was met with criticism, including from Abigail Disney, granddaughter of Disney co-founder Roy Disney, who called the compensation "insane". She argued that the level of compensation was too high compared to that of the median Disney employee.  Greedy and ignorant.
Under the last administration what about this administration.
We priced out a trip for a family of 4 from Canada. 10k....
Disney World is actual hell. The people, the lines, the prices and for what? Don't know why people actually pay to put themselves through literal hell. If I'm gonna pay money and take a trip, it's gonna be out in nature like the Grand Canyon or something.
Our Disney World was a backyard we lived !
F**k that!! I’ll pass
I mean it's..... 5 kids?! What did you expect?!
This is a place of hell for your pocket
That's the reason why my parents weren't able to  afford a Disney trip for me and my brothers 😢first time I went to Disney I was 32 my husband surprise me taking me there for the first time ever  Disney put those prices down is not right!
Lowest common denominator kind of fun for a ton of money. You are way better off going hiking or kayaking. Anything but propping up this stupidity.
Why would you pay to support the enemy.
So fake. Weird dad.
The only thing they will understand  is economics you want to pay to play or not?
Looks like he didn't do his homework.
I’m a Florida resident. I’ve taken my sons 3 or 4 times over the years to Disney. Last time was in 2019. I loved taking them and having those memories. My boys are 18 and the other 16 now. That said it’s an utter money sink. I’ll never go again, the prices have skyrocketed, it’s always overcrowded…and I don’t like their politics either. I think they are looking to cater to more wealthy elite people and wean themselves off of the masses.
I wouldn't waste my money on this pedophilia organization. They dare to overcharge people knowing what they have done. They should close down.
The market dictates the pricing. People plan way ahead for their trips. Doing it on a whim will cost you. They run specials all the time
So Fox hasn’t connected the dots between THE FLORIDA GOVERNOR GOING TO WAR WITH DISNEY, EFFECTIVELY RAISING THEIR TAXES AND PRICES and now having to pass this on to consumers to survive?? Dumb story
Its called robbery
You couldn't pay  ME to go to the dam place. My kids can just go camping.
As a Florida resident that just did 4 parks in March, I think this guy is an idiot! Knowing that at the current time of this article there is still a deal for Florida residents to go to 4 parks in 4 days (not having to be consecutive) for $260 ea.  I'm a single low income mom and still managed to go to 4 parks with my 1 child and not spend what this man spent!! You can bring your own food to the parks. We did not eat at a sit down full service restaurant at any time (which he chose to do). We didn't do any lightening passes. We didn't buy excessive souvenirs. IMO he chose this struggle TO GO VIRAL. As a Florida resident he needs to learn his resources and what's available to him. He just wasn't smart about it at all. And that's on him. Believe me, if he skimped and packed lunches his family would have been just as happy. Mine was! We had Publix subs with us. Brought oranges with us. And always had bottles of water, some were frozen to help keep food cold. But I'm sorry. I don't empathize for him at all. Poor planning
I feel like this should be an Onion article. People really don't know Disney is a for profit corporation? Come on.
He looks completely disgusted with his life. Disney was just an outlet.
Please reduce the prices!!! It’s insane
I was there there other day for 2 of us in australia dollars was 700$ for one day  It does really cost a lot
Imagine how much it cost Disney for every cent they paid. Crumbs
I remember my dad taking us there as a kid, and he complained about the price of everything
Went to Disney with my son last year and  between 2 parks , lighting passes and food , i spent close to $1100.. . 100% not worth it..and never again...  Universal is so much better ... and cheaper..
"It was too expensive. It was too packed!"  I guess it wasn't expensive enough.
That's nothing, I sent my grandchildren to Disney for a week. 6 people and it cost me 19,000 dollars including plane fare. NEVER AGAIN. Did I say never again?
I haven’t been on vacation in years… it’s just not affordable for the average family anymore
If his daughter was paying for it I don't think she would be saying it was worth it.
As long as Man city and Liverpool playing, Arsenal will be less likely to win the league title!  Arsenal should hire Klopp as the new coach.
Theme park fees are an absolute rip off…and queuing up in the heat...not even enjoyable…. we're not ever doing theme parks again.
I won’t spend a cent of my money on anything Disney!
Don’t worry, Trump is coming up with a way to blame the rest of the world for this 😂
Waste all that money when all you had to do was take time and spend with your children talking you could stand in line at the zoo or nature park  and save all that money, must be nice to have that kinda money to just throw away to show your ignorance of money when people are struggling to pay bills and eat ,
I remember paying $120-140 dollars for an annual pass for Disneyland in 2007. And I thought that was a lot money back then.
Bro expected 25$ tickets and free parking? Complete cheap weak “dad”. 200 for the full park each ticket? That’s good. I’d expect to spend 1,300 on that plus food… work harder
Disney se tokyo is much cheaper
You 'd have to pay me $ 1400 to go & I'd still complain about having to go😂
Mas avión y hotel para muchos de nosotros.
Buy the child a PlayStation 5 those memories will last forever Disney Land won't.
Craig is a big time youtuber.
Cheaper Broken Dad.
Everything is high because of trump
Boicot Disney.
He's shocked? it's known like by everyone that those prices are just crazyyy
My husband and I will be there soon 🎉
Walt Disney World was supposed to be an escape from the real world. Not supposed to be a greedy amusement park. Disney NEEDS to lower their prices, so people can go back to Disney and have a good time. Walt Disney is probably rolling in his grave.
Deport this family. Too poor for America
It is very expensive, I went one day and that was just enough.
Boycott Disney's....its no longer familiar and kids friendly, SAD.
Soooo. First never pay at the park to.get into the park. Number 1 rule. I get it was t planned but should of been. I went to universal studios for 4 of us for 3 days with 2 parks and lightning passes I paid a little over 3300$ not including other things. So yeah you gotta plan it out first
Disney is not an essential item. Who gives a f
Disney in Hong Kong also super expensive!! TBH the park is not even that good
My kids really deserve disney but I just can't justify the price and the fact that I will be supporting the wokesters is the final deciding factor.  There are much better things I can do with them for 10 grand in a week.  I'm all for high prices to keep out the riff raff but even that does not work here, they are still there.    no thank you
I absolutely hate Disney, these prices are beyond insane. Also, take a look at the wall behind them... He has a YouTube plaque which tells me that he will be writing this trip off as a business expense (making content) so while it hurts in the front end he will get to expense the trip... Nothing like the dumb families that make a Disney trip the family vacation for several days and will pay more not being residents of the state and most likely staying in a Disney property. I stopped going to Disneyland when my resident local season passes went up to $199 ea for a year. I have not been to Disney in almost 20+ years and do not think I ever will again.
Come to London, all the great Museums are free to get in. You can donate a monetary contribution if you want, but no pressure.
My husband and I went to Disney World for the first time  last year and honestly… it was expensive, even for just the two of us. We spent around $1,500 for 4 park days and about $1,700 on our 8-day stay at Pop Century. That’s over $3,000 for two people. I saved Disney gift cards for extras like snacks and souvenirs. That was helpful however would we go back? Honestly… I’m not sure. We had fun, but spending that kind of money again makes us pause. Maybe one day—but for now, Disneyland feels more doable. It’s still pricey, but not as overwhelming as four parks at Disney World. 😂
Then dont fckn go you i,diot
Doesnt seem to put people off. Everytime im at disney Cali its bursting at the seams with visitors with barely room to move around.
Disneyworld is in the RED STATE of FLORIDA so I blame  Ron DeSantis, Donald Trump, and 100% of Conservatives.  Oh, he's a small businessowner.  I guess we're supposed to salute him and thank him for his service now.
They should’ve bought non expire passes about 10 years ago.  I worked as a manager of a Disney store.  I often encouraged people to buy those.  😊
I live in orlando. NEVER WILL I GO TO DISNEY!!!!
No way not worth it
No one forced them to go...
Maga
Already boycott their stuff😂
I mean, you have 5 people. What did you expect? Thats $300 a person for a day at Disney. Thats not that much in todays economy.
Ha ha
Disney is for wealthy people. Get a life!
That’s ridiculous!
Funny isn't it. You can't fix stupid!
Welcome to the most leftist place in the world!
Welp guess that’s out of the question forever. 😢
For us that have to fly in imagine the hotel cost too and flight
Well, they should give Florida residence a big discount they really should
Absolutely ridiculous!
Buddy spent my bi weekly check in one day 😔
Disney prices aside, this dude is a "Florida Dad"?  First, I'm sure I've seen him with a used car dealership and home in NH.  That's who he is.  And if you say he moved to Florida, that's even worse.  As we say to the transplants and tourists "Welcome to Florida, now go home".  Second, remarkable coincidence that a You Tuber, of all people, is interviewed about Disney prices.  This has social media clout chaser written all over it.
Did she say food and inflation is getting better 🤣true clown
Yes it’s crazy what we pay these prices. Disneyland just continues to raise prices and packing it in to beyond safe standards. This year they’re celebrating their 70th anniversary and pricing at 100 dollars per ticket for a day. You know what that means, just more people at the park. It’s unsafe! The happiest place on earth? The most expensive place on earth is more like it! Supply and demand. Stop going and then maybe their prices will come down?
That why I stopped visiting on an annual basis. It's too overpriced.
What a bucket
30 bucks to park! Not in this life time! Disney can Kiss it
Disney is Evil
Im 38 years and my parents couldnt afford it then and i have wanted to take my kids but its so expensive i live in Michigan its to much
Holy! Unless I experience some kind of financial miracle, I will never be able to take my 2 kids to Disney. I’m a college graduate and I teach full time in public school. I’m seriously struggling just to buy groceries and bills.
They didn't know it's for rich people. Disney name alone is money. This is sad tho cuz some people make the effort to try and save to fulfill a dream.
Jesus who the hell can afford that jesus
Disneyland Paris is also crazy expensive. they rip you off there. My kids told us they will never go back to Disney again due to the rip off pricings.
Trying to make up losses from those bombs woke movies
Soon that place will shut down
Hey donkey didn’t u look up what it cost before
Actually an event you will remember for the rest of your life!
I feel like the dinner wasn’t bad at all for a family of 5 -we can barely go in a date night of 2 in my city w/o hitting $100 plus tip
More expensive than an orthopedic head
The equivalent of lightning passes used to be free. You'd go to a kiosk, chose a time for the ride and take the ticket. Now it ALL requires a smart phone and masses of extra cash. It was so worth it almost a decade ago, now it is a scamming money pit.
Disneyland has always been a big time rip-off. I'll never step a foot near there again
Now do one for NFL tickets
He’s loaded. And a dummy. He blows money on extras then complains about the cost.
“Worse under the last administration….”  “Things are better now?”  Says who?
My son and I from Ohio staying on site is easily 5k trip for 4 days. Been 2 times
Did people think it was gonna be cheaper?
60% profit margin at Disney corporation 😮
I live in Montana I go to the national park for free idiot
I will never give my money to Disney like that. Shut it down. Idiots giving their money to Disney stupid.
And you still have to wait in line to ride!
Biggest rip off …Go to Hawaii and enjoy the beaches
I totally agree. I would never do it again. My husband and I was there with our 17-year-old daughter. From lightning pass lanes to staying on Disney property going to the two parks for three days. It was right under $5000. I am glad she was able to experience it when she was older so now she knows but I am never doing that again. Imagine the so-called Disney rooms With the Aladdin theme didn’t even have updated charging equipment. Yeah that was $2000. 🙄
I don’t recommend giving any money to the Disney grooming syndicate.
I am 38 my daughter is 11 I am literally waiting to graduate school to bring her because DISNEY IS LITERALLY A DREAM vacation!
Mind you he lives in FL dont they get a discount?
GOT BETTER????
So disgusting. Walt Disney would never approv of this. He created that park for children to enjoy but now only a certain class can enjoy it. I was there about 19 years ago and thought it was ridiculous but it wasn't anywhere near those prices. I bought a 2 day pass for my son and I. It was about $250. And we stayed across the street so it was expensive for the room but it certainly wasn't that crazy.
I paid $1600 for 4 tickets only at Universal Studios. Terrible. These were front of the line tickets because I will not pay that much for regular tickets only to ride two rides and stand in the hot sun all day. I know everyone can’t afford to pay that much and I’m grateful to be able to afford it, but these places are greedy and overpriced.
It’s gotten a little bit better ?? 🤨 gurllll it’s much more worse !!
One minute you MAGA’s believe in capitalism and the next you’re complaining about prices that no one is forcing you to pay. You guys don’t have a clue what you really believe.
American  Corporate Greed  ,...........how  disgusting Disney really is,..........hope  karma catches up to disney brass..........
We can hardly afford drinks in the house
Under last administration? 😂 you are garbage.
They support in the left party because Disney World it’s like ABC to Far to the left They’ll just keep up the price because people will pay there’s one born every day
Feel the same way pullin up on Figg these days
Thats like being homeless and walking into a Louis Vuitton store complaining about the prices 😅 cost $11billion to run Disney World per year.
I feel like he got off cheap.
Someone has to pay for their movie flops like Snow White.
I was spending $6000 a year on Disney trips. Got tierd of high cost. We bought an RV and travel for half the cost and 10X the adventures and memories!
That’s crazy!
Family fun ain’t cheap no more
Fox always a political scam ~ people cant afford things , especially the last administration~ bullsjit.
The best part about Disney is that you don’t have to go there.
There is Nooooooo.......way im paying $947.00 to Disney! That is just stupidCrazyGreedy! And you paid for it!!!! Yikes! Prayers!
I just watch Koda Bear livestream from Disneyland everyday
Boycot disney....Is that ok?
We went to Disney 2 years ago with the kids on vacation for 2 weeks and spent around $8,700. It's crazy how expensive it is there 😕💸
It's gotten a little bit better? Lol. Well well well well!!! Trump is making it better? MAGA until the end of this world.
Suppose to bring ur own food n snacks for the day dummy 😅
Deport Disney.
Baby it has gotten worse not better…..how can anyone think that the economy will ever get better under Trump when he still thinks the word Groceries is a new term that people stopped using
They raise the prices because people keep paying it.
When I was a kid we played with boxes.
😒😒😒Um…It’s Disney. What do you expect?  I was born and raised in Florida. It’s always been expensive ,even 40 yrs ago and with the Florida resident discount. This is NOT anything new or shocking.  The hotels inside the park were expensive. The food. Expensive. Those cute little Mickey’s ears /shaped head ice cream bars were like $5.00 back then. People might hear Disney World/Orlando and may think the ticket price includes all the parks that are there. No.   The Disney characters/ princesses etc were not walking around all over the place like they make you think. You MAY have seen ONE, that’s it.   Half the time the rides were closed for repairs. and long lines if open.  Back then, Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride. Closed. Repairing. 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea. Closed. Repairing. It’s A Small World Ride, you’d get stuck in the boat ride through it midway and be stuck listening to that song over and over for 5 minutes.  The “ghosts” you were supposed to “see “at the end of The Haunted Mansion riding with you were not there. Lol.   It’s Florida so of course it’s  hot. Gets crowded. Alot of walking, waiting in long lines, getting to a ride only to find it’s closed, long lines to get food.   It isn’t the whole magical, family friendly, experience they make it out to be.
Cedar Point is better and much cheaper.
But but but my kids want to go 😂
Blame the idiots who pay that much and enabling corporate greed.  STOP paying outrageous prices and watch them beg you to come in for free!!!!!!!!!
Lmao. Waste of money. I don’t see the point of going.  Better places to go with that kind of money.
LMAO
Don’t have five kids
I remember when Disneyland was $28 for a ticket 🎫, that was 1995 - 30 years later; welcome to inflation.
It's nice to have a dad that cares about you.
what a cute family :)
Yeah in Anaheim as CA residents family of 4 came out to 2600 for one day 😂 and this was late 2024 winter time lol
Work harder you bum
My family recently went and I agree, the cost is way too high. My kids loved it, but everything was so expensive. I did pay for the lightning lanes, and I do feel they were worth it.  They are expensive but once you use one you can book another, so there are always 3 in cue and I think most days we got to use them on 9 rides total. We rode everything we wanted and never waited in a line longer than 15 minutes.
That’s a ridiculous cost.
Makes sense since it’s Florida
Brought me to tears when her favorite part was being with her family waiting and talking❤ parents this is why it is so important to remain calm and high vibrational even when cash is low and frustration is lurking. Cherish each moment with your loved ones.
All I can say is…… LOL 😂 LMAO 🤣 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😅😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😅🥹😅😂😂🤣🤣🤣🥲🤣🤣😂😂😅😅😂😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣🥲🥲😆😆😆🥲🥲🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😂😂😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😂😅😂😅😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😇😂😇😂😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😅😅😅😂😅😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😅😅😂😂😂😅😂😅😂😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😅😅😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂😅😅
Its not that bad tbh, tickets were already 1k so spending only 400 for the whole day w 3 kids aint bad
Yikes!
That'll keep da cheapskates & scum at bay
RIDICULOUS at least kids under 5 years old 50% off and the parking should be free!
If you have kids, you have to check Disney off the bucket list at least once. You just have to take it on the chin and move on.
Tell him to go to California and then talk to me
His not very cute with that 💩 on the head he looks weird
Dad was about 5 seconds from tears from his daughter's response at the last question in the end.
F Disney! Wouldn't spend a penny at Disney!
Disney feels like they are worthy and so they can charge those kinda prices.
That’s still cheaper than Disneyland
Pay up, maga mofos!!!
You knoww why, you dumbass??! You can THANK TRUMP. He started that war with disneyland.
Supply & demand. If enough people say "enough", Disney will have no choice but to lower prices. Clearly, there are many willing to pay. Am I the only one not really resonating with this? Have good amusement parks ever been "cheap"? Take your kids to the beach or go for a nice long hike.
That’s crazy what happen to a good cheap family vacation?
Thats to be expected these days.
Probably around $100 a ticket........ this guy choose to spend that much money. He could have spent $400 if he was truly trying to budget.
To hell with Disney World. Take your kids to a state or national park & go fishing for the day !! Or go to the beach, there's lots of free things you can do. I have ZERO desire to EVER to a Disney park
I cant believe this stupid news reporter thru in politics. You may need to look back at the prices of everything nothing has gotten better it’s gotten ten times worse. Cheeto Dust has seen to that. 😡
What do you expect?It's Disney they thrive off of ignorant families like this
Oh well...deserves it for taking his children to a place that covers for preditors of children... Giving his money to them...walt is turning in his grave!!!
Everything is going to get very much more expensive soon, so enjoy this while you can
You cant go to disney for 1 day they discount longer you are there
Why is this an issue? $1,400 for 5 ppl is cheap for Disney, that’s a bargain. We were 8 ppl and the whole package was around $2,400 with hotel, this was many years ago.
It’s disgusting what they are doing, we are locals in Orlando and those prices are ridiculous… imagine those who come in to florida and have to pay for hotels or vacation homes, plus meals, car rentals, etc… you need a fortune to be able to afford that… and keeping in mind how horrible the weather gets during the summer, too hot, or too rainy, or storms that make rides close, plus huge lines it’s not worth it. All the money Disney has been losing because of their wokeness now they want to recuperate by overcharging those who are willing to pay. Absolutely disgraceful
People dont realize you end up paying more when you dont stay at Disney. Theres a lot of perks and significant discounts staying on site. Been there so many times...
What makes it not worth any of it is the lines
The had an idea of pricing out poor folks. They failed to realize now only drug dealers entitled kids are the only ones that can afford to go and them kids are thugged out.
Weak parents bring there kids to Disney
I don't take my family to Disney any more. Walt would be mortified
Been telling friends for years… can spend a week scuba diving in Fiji for less than a week in Disney.
Everything now is for the rich!
Epstein/Trump files anyone! Patel? Bondi? Lock them up? Where’s Trump hiding Epstein? We know Trump had Epstein moved from jail. Where o where is Jeffrey Epstein and Maxwell?  Can the press try to get to see Maxwell in prison?  I want proof she’s there and would love to hear what she has to say since she’s the only one to pay for a crime committed mostly by rich white male rapists.
WDW caters to the rich.  Their business model now is to bring rich people into the parks and charge more.  Unfortunately this model has worked elsewhere.
Don’t worry…”your gonna be so rich” —Trump 🤣🤣🤣
Prices have skyrocketed to insane levels. I wouldn’t pay that much. Disney lost its compass.
F you cannot afford it don’t go. The price has never changed. I have been on Disney cruises and Disney. Not for the poor
Maybe don't be poor? What are we supposed to do, throw a pityparty?
USA-USA-USA-USA!!!! GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH
We traveled to Japan and went to Disneyland Tokyo. We spent less for our entire two week trip to Japan and three days at Disneyland than our last trip to Disney World where we enjoyed the Immersive Star Wars Hotel before it closed. Yes, that was stupidly expensive but I will see the kids loved it.
Disney was a Freemason grifter who most likely trafficked children under Disney. Tunnels everywhere! Wake up
Ok so don't go...
Entitlement.
It always saddened me that i could never afford to take my children there, like Disney don't have enough money its shameful 😔 😤
Wow, Ainsley has gone down hill since she is having to let that walrus climb on her every night.
Wow...I can totally relate. I'm a longtime Disney fan. We have completely changed the way we do Disney on our yearly trip. No restaurants, stay in an off site resort with a kitchen. Bring everything we need to eat and drink to the parks. We stand it all the lines. Calculate the best time to visit when weather is beautiful with low to moderate crowd levels. We pay absolutely no extras on anything. And it's STILL incredibly expensive.
Happiest place on earth (for them )
Shhuuuu....you gonna need a visa or MasterCard just to have a descent fun there, I did not come back no more because of that, and I live close to there
Spent over 100 bucks on freaking hotdogs in one setting.
Never spending money with Disney ever again
974 for 5 ticket isnt unreasonable, unless you try to compare today's cost to the cost from a decade ago
One thing I’ll give fox they got those hot bimbos on there
How do you think Disney can recover from all the Woke movies and shows you ask ? By charging suckers 1400.00 a day for an over hyped experience , keep feeding the machine suckers .
Disney is really fun, however it is just as what was said, very expensive.
'Dad reveals.......nearly $1400'.....sexist of Fox to focus on the 'Dad'! Doesn't his wife/partner contribute to the household income? I bet she does!!
5 people  900 bucks sounds right
Stop going…
Haven't been in 8 years and I don't ever plan on returning.  Waste of money!
Then don’t go to Disney snowflake
This dude isn’t pinching Pennie’s if he threw $1400 away on one day… come on people 😂  And his daughter saying “yeah I think it was worth it” is absolutely crap. She is a child… she doesn’t know how much $1400 is 😂
You go to Disney you give money to the very machine that opened the borders, discriminates against white people, put men in women’s sports, and supports pedophilia
Tell Dad to go to a football game. He’ll be doubly shocked. And eggs are still over 7.00
I’m sorry but that’s not too bad. For 4 ppl in Cali 2016 it was about $1000+ to enter
Big deal. Obviously he took a hit. It is unlikely that its a weekly occuring routine
No sympathy. He was a fool to go in the first place.
disney is ridiculous!!!
All while you have to keep your kids on a Leah and in view because the  the place is crawling with child predators.
I will never go to Disney. Why? Exactly $$$ it is ridiculous.
Good example of China is paying the tariff. LMAO
Working as intended, they don't want the "poors" in the Disney World at all.
" PEOPLE WHO CANT AFFORD THIER GROCERIES UNTER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION "...SLICK PROPOGANDA.....BUT WE SEE YOU
The best Disney🕍 ride is the  " RIDE HOME 🏠"😂💬
I will go to a green off road area and have a family picnic costing 100$.. and good family time
Outrageous
What a giant financial  Mickie Mouse Trap it is! Took my daughter there twice… what a waste of money. My grandkids now don’t even know about this park’s existence… NEVER again!!!
Looks like Disneyworld upped the tariffs on the US
I'd rather visit the beach 😎🏖🌊
pay up peasent,😂
If a small business owner is complaining about Disney then the average worker would go broke trying to go
Ridiculous!!
Family of 6 $200 a piece not too bad lol
Discovery Code is a much better option
I’ve NEVER been and have no desire to go!!
I spent $1.1K on my new chain. 😊
Buy your kid a vr headset at that rate. Let them have infinite adventures for a quarter the price. You know, it's not unreasonable to teach kids about the cost of the things they want, and offer them alternatives. I surely would never pay this much for a day at the park, and I don't think that's so bad, even if they really wanted it.
My family never went to Disney world when we were kids. Growing up I had a bit of fomo but now I’m glad we didn’t spend our money there.
?!?!? Wait until your store shelves are empty and prices sky rocket under the fascist administration! Fool!
$1,400 day trip "AND" then has to wear miney ears with a smile 😁  this guy truly is in hell definitely father of the year
He said five kids. That's why you keep your limit at 3
Because your LORD Donald Dump is making everything expensive because he lied!!!
Honestly not that bad. 280 a person for one day. I think I went and I was there for a week and I paid like 3000
All of the gender reassignment surgery isn’t cheap
Big scammer Disney
And he bought those mouse ears ... That will probably end up in the garbage in 2 months. That's one part of the problem.
My family would laugh at me if i wanted to go to a place that cost that kind of money.  When i was a kid a trip to go to something like that had to be round 50 dollars total.. 😅. We didnt do something that cost 100 dollars to do.  I wanted to see Legoland in the 80s just to see how different it was in 1984 or whatever, but it was too pricey then. And that was not gonna be anywhere near these America prices. Maybe 120 dollars for all of us, but that was insane enough.
DISNEY IS NOT AFFORDABLE! ITS STUPID!
Why are conservatives still supporting such an evil corporation like Disney! Dixie General Store heflin Alabama
The price of things has not gotten better.
Trying to make any dime they can after the snow woke disaster
6 of us went back in 2000 for a week with the price of the timeshare was like 5k I thought that was a good deal and ended up investing in a timeshare
The hack is get a friend who works there and can get you free stuff 😊
It,s gotten a little bit better?  Where do you live?
If it’s not worth it then stop going. I would love it if there were fewer people there. But it’s still fricken crowded, even more crowded than I ever remember in 2025. But if you can’t stop going because you love it too much, then I guess it’s priced exactly where it needs to be.
The place is crowded and had a one hr wait on all rides. For middle class to upper middle class families.
Her favorite part was spending time with family...well ya'll could have spent time together for free if that's the case. Maybe not free but waaaaay less than $1,400
They even blamed the price of Disney on the last administration
It’s probably so expensive because Disney keeps losing money with their crappy movies. Gotta recoup those loses somehow.  Hopefully next time that family just goes to another amusement park that is much cheaper.
Meanwhile, $3,000 for Taylor Swift concert tickets is no big deal...
When you know a middle class working American earns roughly 4500 bucks a month, 1400 for a family outing is a hell of a stretch... Especially when you know you're gonna spend most of your time queuing in line for the rides.
Disney world was a very expensive semi- honeymoon/ graduation/ vacation for me and my husband. But as much as they keep increasing the costs, there are too many people at the parks- the lines take forever. My husband thought it was worth it to get the fast pass- we wouldn’t be returning for at least 5 years. We wanted to get the most of the experience and feel it was worth it. We visited from Los Angeles, so we had to pay a premium for the flights, hotels, and uber rides.
I am so happy that I will never have to spend another dollar at Disney. Took my family of 4 there in the 90's and it was just under $1000 for parking, tickets, lunch and snacks. Lines were 45 minutes for a 45 second ride...so we only waited for 5 rides total all day. What a joke.
From a European, Americans are opening their wallets too much. Also in Europe they do it. They get milked when  buying or renting real estate, restaurants, etc. It must be entitlement?
leave the kids at home and go to Vegas.
Disney is not what it was 20 years ago certainly not what it was 30-40 years ago when it was about family. Parents don’t put yourself and your children through the misery of wasting thousands of dollars in the heat and two hour lines to ride a 45 second ride. Take your kids on an educational journey to a foreign country or the Caribbean where they will actually learn different cultures and have amazing memories. If you go there after reading this you will understand exactly what I was trying to tell you.
1400 is absolutely crazy👀 yes, 3 kids will always be more expensive than 1 but a day at an amusement park shouldn't cost that much. The thing is I'm a bit torn only because I feel like they definitely could've saved up on some money .. the dad is talking about trying to pinch pennies but eats at one of the restaurants where he spends 250$.. that dinner could've been completely avoided by simply bringing your own food and drinks. Is it annoying to carry a heavy backpack around all day ? Yeah but I'd rather carry a backpack than pay 250 $ for dinner. Just preparing a couple of sandwiches for everyone, having some fruit and veggies and some cookies for in between snacks will do the job for the day. If you want to eat something warm you could always also bring  1/2 thermos flask with hot water around and some ramen cups. Even If you fill the water early in the morning it will keep warm til 2/3 pm you don't have to eat at the costly restaurants, there are alternatives 👀 ..  My parents and I always did this because we couldn't afford the park entrance and eating there on top of it, they also never bought me any of the merch because it's too expensive which was fine after they explained it to me because all I cared about in the end was to spend a fun day and quality time with my family and that is what the kids value the most anyways, as you can see here as well.
The place is still packed though. The reality is, there are so many rich people now, there are more millionaires than ever before. The harsh truth is they don’t need to sell them cheap
Gotta pay to play
I’ll take a day at a national park over Disney any day!
They could have set through a timeshare presentation for a few of those tickets!!
Nice response by the daughter at the end "which was your favourite part?"
I'm not interested in Disney's, waste of money!! PLUS. Disney is too WOKE 👎👎
i will never go back to Disneyland ever again my kids hate it lines crazy long as hell. I take my family now to the beach 🏝️ and the mountains 🏔️ we went fishing 🎣 last week and i only spend $360 meals included vs Disneyland $1500 folks take your family to see nature.
Bro got a YouTube plack up in the wall and he bitching about 1,0000$ dollars stuuuupid 🤣😂🤦‍♂️
How about WWE’s Wrestlemania ticket costing 30k-60k a person 😂
Don't worry, folks. I'm sure he made his money back and then some on youtube and fox.
That’s not expensive .. you have 5 people. If I go on a date with a woman it cost $100 - $200
It's a concerted effort to make majority not too comfortable,.and keep everyone churning the wheel.
thats so idiotic, yet it is still packed, full of brainless people, its easy to charge parents that much when playing with kids emotions but that way should kids be realize that much better places are to go to are for free and yet you still enjoy your family time
To be expected, Disney is not somewhere you go regularly for some its once in a lifetime experience for others every few years or annually, it’s not cheap to maintain these theme parks costs a lot of money in today’s high cost environment
Even with these lavish prices , the Park was still crowded ....so I don't see them lowering any time soon.....
Tarrifs hiting Donald Duck 😂😂😂
Sounds like a rip off😮
Criminal, why do people go there?? I would never go even if it was free, I just dont get it, hate everything Disney 😊
Forest city tour much cheaper
🌷the little chick gave 2 thought•provoking, mature answers that blew my mind! 💋🩷🥰🌷
I go to Disney every week and it costs me $25 each time.  Add $60 per month for the annual pass.  This story sucks
I hope Disney keeps robbing these idiots so to the point they become impoverished unwittingly.
Every square inch of Disney is a profit center. Whatever you want there is an additional tab for getting it. Getting to walk into the park is just the upfront fee.
Aside from these corporate greed is that they just want to set standard on the park goers to state that your above class of the society because you can afford disney
Got better!? Ask trump to demand that Disney reduce prices !
Should've done some homework first. There will be LOTS of forums discussing this sort of thing.
Imagine if you also had to pay for the flight, car rental, Airbnb. That's what we had to do.
He didn’t do his homework by watching Youtubers on how to Disney. Also, you pay more when you have a bigger family. I only have one kid.  We go to Disneyland every week with our $100 a month annual pass. Each visit turns out to be $25. There’s only two of us.   Today I bought a Mickey shaped popcorn container that lights up and change his color for about $25 and a Jawa shaped cup that has lights and sounds and comes with unlimited refills for another $25. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Kid doesn't look impressed at all by the trip.
This is more than half a year min wage in South Africa.
I'm shocked that the dad didn't actually look up prices before going. Lol what did he expect. Tickets alone should have been the wake up call. 🤦‍♂️
LOL $250 FOR A SNACK
That reporter is delusional! Prices have gone down under this administration… is she kidding or believing the lies she is saying?
As a young black man from The Bronx New York, my kids are NOT going to no Disney BS..This is straight ROBBERY…It’s probably OVERRATED Too..
under the last administration??? lol
Disney literally hates young White families AND YET they keep cucking over cash to enrich those that hate them ...
Speaking from experience, a one-day trip to Disneyland isn’t long enough and lets me know he didn’t plan well either…
Workers at Universal Studios barely make above minimum wage as well. Fun environment,  but low pay.
Best part for the kid is being in the line talking with family.  Wow.  That's eye-opening.  Glad I dint but the express passes  too.. Next time I will go camping
Convert that to Australian dollars. I've paid that much to go to Thailand, for 2 people, and stay a week.
Who still goes there?….
Disney World is not worth it. Never been, never will. Visiting Disneyland once in 1976 was enough for me! I still have books of tickets I didn't use! What a fun dad to wear those ears!
He's a small business owner. He should know full well what's a cash cow. Unfortunately, this time Disney milks HIM...
Don't ever go back brother. 😅
I don't know about Florida but here in California I get Disneyland tickets through Costco and a three-day trip/entry costs about the same as a 2-day trip so it's very economical to go for three days and that includes park entry and hotel. You can bring your own food into Disneyland and they have lockers that are quite large that you can rent to store stuff in if you need to. I do ride share to and from the park and since I buy through Costco and it has been a lot less expensive than parking at the park and also a lot less walking/time. The parking at the hotel is free (Costco travel packages have good packages with Disney) so I just leave the car there. I usually have one meal and one snack while I'm there, sit down restaurant experiences are going to cost you and you should plan ahead of time for them; I prefer a la cart and eat outside in the park. I've also redeemed freebies from the Costco page printouts and have gotten nice pins and lanyards per person which were a really nice touch to the travel package. That's how I do Disneyland.
Dad got emotional after the daughter response it made the trip worth it
Well, Disney touches children in the wrong way soooo. Id assume thr cost is to help pay for privacy.
If you're suprised by the cost of a Disney vacation then you weren't paying attention when you booked it.
My brother went with 3 kids it cost 3600 total . Ridiculous.  Meanwhile Canadians pay half
Parking is not included!?!
Its greed and FOX supports corporate greed
I thought Walt Disney was a certified p like Drake
Biltmore estate in NC is just as bad
Yeah to expensive lot of wait times and hot as hell no thanks
1400 usd? Eso fue lo que gasté solo en los vuelos desde mi ciudad a Orlando. Que jodida está la situación en EEUU 😆
Ppl guess what…stop going!
Prices are better now then under the last administration? Really?.....Ohhh yeah it's fox😅
Who goes to Disneyland without knowing what their paying??? This is actually going viral??? People are either stupid or bored.
This is for the lying Fox Journalist.  🤥  The cost of living is increasing worse every day.  It is WORSE than the previous administration.  There are thousands of Americans living hand to mouth.   To drop $1,300 for a one day outing is either rent for some, a car payment plus utilities and food.   Most American lives are losing with this fascist regime that you call government.  This fascist government supports only the rich and to heck with anyone else.  They only care about themselves.
If u buy one day ticket for 5 people, you are gonna pay $160+ for each
Why would you sponsor a woke business
having Kids nowadays is expensive.
There are still long queues. Not expensive enough.
How about saying “no” to the kids and go out to the park and play with them - stop indulging the children’s whims  - stop buying Chinese  made junk - stop whining. 🇬🇧
"Dad left in shock by staggering cost of Disney trip"  Has this guy been living under a rock most of his adult life? Disney has always been expensive since at least the late 90s.
I wouldn’t go to Disney if it was a free trip
You still blame the past administrayion lol😂
Take your kids to a MAGA rally instead,  cheaper
Wow that kids answer says it all!
This is the main reason why i won't take my family to Disney because it's too expensive and I want to enjoy the experience not be worried about spending so much money on a trip there
Disney, don’t care about the people that cannot afford it. They only care about making their pockets bigger. that’s the reason why we stopped going to Disney.
1400 for stress for the parents!
They charged you to wait outside,
Yeah don't go to Disney..it will be much nicer with shorter lines..
Love Disney..best theme park
Trump's economy..it was half the cost last year
Disney after going woke, deserves to go broke. Hope this report helps people think twice.
We bought the genie pass and we couldn’t use it on rides we really wanted to use them on…. Like  the roller coaster’s. Also I was super over heated and I couldn’t rest really anywhere in a cool place other than a restaurant.. It was super hot out but everyone says it’s good to go early to be able to get on more rides. So we had to be there while the sun was beaming.
It’s worse if you’re out of state. The cheapest hotel was $5k for less than a week.Not including travel,rides or merch. I really want to take my son but this place is a father’s nightmare! Unfair!
As an American...fckin Americans!
Park is free. Before you go to Disney, you must have check the prices.
I'm sad to know the horrific cost for Disney vacation in USA. I thought spending a family holiday in Disneyland and Disney Sea resort in Chiba−ken，Japan were quite expensive but watching this news made me think better to visit Japanese version because accommodation fees and park entrance fees are less expensive.  Also, if you're not keen on Disney characters, there’re a beautiful aquarium with a large park near Disney resorts and other enjoyable family friendly facilities. Like others say there’re lots of exciting  and thrilling amusement parks in USA as well as Japan. Why not spend in Japanese hot spring resorts  and national parks for hiking and camping instead of burning money for not so magical kingdom !？
He wasn't being punished.  He put himself there.
Disney knows people are SUCKERS so they continue to raise prices.
Ive never been there and have no desire to go. Even as a kid it had no appeal to me. I went to six flags a few times as a kid and thought that was expensive in the 90s but this place takes the cake! People need to stop going and u will see how fast the prices will drop. Wont happen though because people never want to wait, they want that instant gratification even though they will complain about it later
F all things Disney.
Should have went to Universal and staued at a Universal resort hotel where every guest gets an express pass.
So many other things to do. But people keep going to Disney to get ripped off. Americans are too weak to boycott
The reporter said that prices for groceries are getting better. Is she smoking something?? It’s gotten so much worse under Trump!! Prices for everything is going up.
You’d have to GIVE me $1000 to spend a day at Disneyhell…only Fox would say “things are getting a little bit better” than before.  Just can’t stop the propaganda spin, Fox.
When you spent over $1,000, just buy your kid that $50 life saver
Ridiculous. It’s definitely not about the kids or family
But still Foxnews praises the bafoon 47
Best way to protest is not to go
Last I checked we’re still in America. Don’t go 🤷🏼‍♂️
Faux “News” host with her unbiased reporting: “We do all these stories on people who can’t afford groceries or gasoline, or at least that was under the last administration… “
Waste of money atleast he can afford it prolly has hella money im living check by check and braught my family a couple years ago and I spent hotel Disney etc like 2k for 3 days had a good time overall but hurt my pockets and I’m not rich but as a dad you do what you can to see your kids happy, bad part I spent all that money for my kids to not go on many rides because they were young 2 and 4 told myself never going to Disney again until theyre about 4 and 6
Disney u should ashamed of yourself
This is crazy!!!!!! Boycott Disneyland!!!!
People complaining of cost of vacations.  If you can’t afford to take vacations, you wouldn’t be taking them.
That’s horrible. I’m glad I can’t go to Disney. I seriously can’t afford it.
The fact that he can bring his whole family! I have to get my kids to play rock, paper, scissors on who can go....🫤
$1300 for her to say the best part was waiting in line! We can go in the front yard and stand in a line and talk for free.
Her answer was worth $1,400.  ❤  Honestly, Busch Gardens is much better.
Just go to six flags
Bob Iger is a MONSTER. He has GOT to go.
Should read Dad in shock after the cost of everything.
Gimme a break! Newsflash--you don't have to go to f***ing Disney!
very happy that i went in the 1980,s.  It was fantastic then, and the bars in Orlando were very cheap.  Loved it.........for sure i would not go now
It’s not expensive to go to Disneyland and to a restaurant, this is a perfect example that our money is no good. It’s worth less and less all the time.
Not the happiest place on earth. No thanks!
Don’t touch what you can’t afford.
THE PRICE TAKES ALL FUN AND GOOD MEMORIES OUTTA THE ENTIRE TRIP....  FU(K DISNEY LAND!
Insane. No thanks.
Can't believe this is a real complaint from the station that advocated for companies right to charge outrageous prices under "free market".
what a rip... suckers
what a loser. take the family to a trip but complain about pricing to the news. just say you’re broke. just say you’re broke
It’s gotten better? Girl get a clue! I’m sick of both parties and their idiocracy!
The title sounds like the Babylon Bee 🙃
This guy is a social media pro wearing his Minnie mouse ears.  if it’s so expensive then why did he go on the trip in the first place?
I interviewed a family of 5 went to McDonalds for lunch. They spent $115.34 so I'm not sure where this is going 😅
Nobody forced you to go; stay home.
What a rip off! I spent $1600  traveling solo in Colombia for one month and made a lot of great memories.
Disney is evil and they hate your children. Look at the damage they've GLEEFULLY done to Walt Disney's vision.   He's turning in his grave
While rich/wealthy people keep paying these prices, these businesses don’t need money from the poor.
I have never been and would never go because of children were trafficked.
Was a wow answer. Covering the every level, of any value, in one pass ❣️
No different visiting Universal Studios at Singapore over $182.00 per person for entrance fee and return cable car ride
He wanted to pinch pennies but got 5 kids. Cmon now
oh please,  you knew that trip was going to be expensive karen
He's not broke he's a YouTuber making money off saying what he can't "afford". (genius). He knew how to much it was going to cost but you can get famous pretending to be relatable. Smart move. People want to complain etc etc and there's big money in it. It's a smart move and I say more power to them lol
No where to go with kids thats affordable!!
You couldn’t pay me to go to Disney. Food and drinks are crazy expensive. Lines are crazy long. The parks are incredibly crowded. Some kids dream of going to Disney, but that dream quickly becomes a nightmare. They can keep it!
Thank goodness my Disney days are over. That is atrocious what that is costing.
Disney is a ripoff
Spending time with family is the best part!! Wow!! This kid is amazingly honest!!
Welcome to the most expensive place on earth. lol 😂 😂😂😂
Only place to get stuff at the goodwill Mickey Mouse items
All the place like this cost a lot if money
I brought my oldest kids to disneyland ehen they were 2. Admission for the day was $60 per adult. I thought it was alot. The good old days...
Make Disney go out of business.
Ticket prices are posted online. Let’s not pretend he had no idea. Yes it’s expensive but he also had a choice not to go.
Flying Wheels!
Welcome to the real world Dad! My parents took me for my 9th birthday, and it wasn’t cheap. My parents paid CASH no credit.
Ok kids Disney world or college you choose
Groceries in the last administrative were expensive but now it's a little bit better?! What are you talking about?!
When I was young it was 15.00 for a book of tickets.
It’s surprising that they’re still in business
The prices are on the website, its a total ripoff but this shouldn’t be surprising.
Fox News trying to find something to rage on, while their beloved president destroys our economy 😂
So just went to WDW 2 months ago. Took Lyft to all parks, maybe 22$, cant dodge prices to get in, but DO NOT DO SIT DOWN RESTAURANTS.  To expensive. I have 5 to feed and found quick serve was WAY cheaper. Also, just get water bottles to bring to parks and get free water to fill from them! Saved alot of $. GL
GO AGAINST THEMMMM. BOYCOTTTT THEM....
Hell I can’t afford it and the last time I was there was 10 years ago and just around 9000 grand for 5 days crazy
The problem here is that people aren't slowing down; they don't care about money because, most of the time, it's credit card debt. When everything was paid in cash, I don't think people would spend like this. Now, they just spend and live paycheck to paycheck. People need to slow down and spend only the money they have. If you don't have cash in your account, don't go. Disney is a crazy, overcrowded place where you have to wait at least two hours to get on a ride. It's totally not worth it. The place is more overwhelming than relaxing, and there's nothing enjoyable about it.
I wouldn't pay 1/10 of that to go to disney.
It was 874 usd for 4 people in 2018  with the fast pass now it's almost double
Disney straight garbage. Would've spend $1
Hold up this guy is a millionaire. This is a joke.
DID THIS IGNORANT "news" character JUST SAY PEOPLE COULDN'T AFFORD THINGS "UNDER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION"?! PROOF THAT ONE CAN FIND AN IDIOT IN CLEAR VIEW! Under HER idiocy, THIS ADMINISTRATION is FORCING DISNEY TO RIP PEOPLE OFF!
"Small business owner who worked so hard," you mean YouTuber, who just advertised his channel on Fox News for his benefit, who works maybe an hour a day on his channel.
I thought the American people were the richest people in the world?
Actually sounds like a pretty decent cost for the day
FK that.  thanks for the info, I won't be going.
Cost more here at the California Disneyland
1400 to get that chance of a lifetime of waiting in line :P
All theme parks are expensive, my famliy and I save all year to take a week in August. If you take a day trip with 5, be prepared to pay.
Disney is the real Playboy 😂
Go to Disneyland, tickets pricing is more and a bigger story than this trash
2:17 did she said the economy got a little bit better under trump’s administration? 🤨
What do you expect from a savage, over rated  capitalist culture? 💰🤡💰
💰💰💰🐷💰💰💰
That is ridiculous!  I would not pay that!!!
last time i went too disney or Universal studios was 2006 😂😂 i liked it spent about $800 on just myself but id never ever take a whole family i rather go too rocky point,cancun or Mazatlan for $500 4 night stay all inclusive resort at a beach front private property. 😂😂😂
Me and my daughter went for a few hours and it was over $400 just to get in and not counting food and souvenirs ect and I’m a Florida resident.
Craig drives a Lamborghini and a Ferrari. Can buy cars for 800 and sell them for 3k. Craig is the last guy I care about complaining about the cost of Disney.
Disney's Greed is inflating
Yep its crazy ears parking eating at park dinner at park hotel stay its out control prices
Shameful! Greedy place!
How do people even afford this!!!!
Hate Disney! Take them to the mountains 🏔️
I would rather pay a trip to Cancun Mexico than Disneyland
Not to mention the food 💵💵
Stop wasting money at theme parks, take your family camping and hiking enjoy the outdoors. We never stepped foot at Disney or Universal, we bought a cheap motorhome and took camping trips from the time our kids were born and until they graduated college. Our kids have seen and experienced some great times.
Disney is going under...so they are gouging everyone they can.
I've never been, nor do I plan on going.  Too expensive, and too woke.  I'm not missing a thing!
PHUCK DISNEY! Nothing but supporting p-does
Me and my wife sent our whole family total to 20 people when went to universal flew from Houston to Orlando. My wife and I Spent 30k for 4 days
1400 bucks to wait in lines for hours in the Florida heat for the rides
Tap in to the Florida resident 4 day park deal, makes each day about $68 which is easier to swallow
Silver dollar city is a little bit cheaper
But these expenses are paying the employees a living wage, benefits, etc. and boosting local economies
This is why things are getting expensive, people are willingly spending more.
Dad was shocked because he is a complete moron!!!! I don't believe for one second he didn't know what the ticket prices were, and if the day was getting out of control, why did he take the family to dinner on the Disney property???
That’s more than my $CAD weekly paychecks! Jesus holy moly….!
Bro that’s cheap, was $3000 for us from Massachusetts hotels and Disney
Its not worth going to these theme parks if you dont have enough money. Save enough for the fast pass for a better experience so you dont stand in line all day
Disney sucked 20 years ago and atill sucks today. Univeraal studios and sea world are much better options. And her favortie part qas watiing in line because thats what she did 95% of the time. If youre gonna go do t go i. The summer or on the weekends
Havnt been to Disney in years therre beyond expensive to have a good time.
BoyCott Disney and it’s despicably corporate greed
I haven’t been to Disney in about 7 years, and if I never go back again, that would be alright with me too. I’m 42, and amusement parks in general just don’t do it for me anymore, largely because ive pretty much outgrown them. Besides, I can walk around and get sunburned at home for free.
It's gotten a little bit better I was actually gonna like but so much for that thank you Fox News for reminding me who you really are
My parents took us to Walt Disney World and Sea World during a trip to Florida to see relatives in the mid 70s. That is the only time in my life that I have been to that park. Before that we went to Wildwood, New Jersey before that and it was much cheaper. If you want a fun and economical vacation check out the coastal towns in New Jersey.
So i wouldn't go there  .
So smart. He promoted his channel in the interview for freeeee!
Something in the same genre that costs less…state fairs, small town celebrations that have rides, games, music, food, etc
Kendall knew exactly what to say to make Dad feel better about the long lines and the money spent. She enjoyed the laughter & talking while patiently waiting their turn. That's beautiful, although it was costly. It sounds like money well spent.  DO BETTER DISNEY!!
This story is so dumb , he didn't do his research before he went
Oh..not just disney! Most of all the theme parks! Discusting how much they raised the prices! 😮😮😮
Stop spending money at disney
It’s gotten a little better???? Where?
The last administration? Prices are even more insane now! Whay do you mean they gotten a little bit better, im paying nearly 7 dollars for eggs and seeing 2 extra dollars on all dairy.
0:40 the moment they popped on screen we all knew exactly what lead up to this setup 😂. This is a very good father
Disney has always been expensive. This is nothing new
This was click bait. So he's well off?  next!
And that right there, is a fine example of conservative parenting!! Great job Dad!! 👏🏻👏🏻
That's a sweet kid! ❤
It is the flying wheels dealer guy from new Hampshire
This not what Walt would have wanted, he was an Altruistic caring person who loved family values, and  bringing people together to enjoy life.
Felt that pain dad, one time trip for my 4.
I would not go If they paid me 1300.$!!!
Smh...it's so weird! Because they never update anything at Disney. Living in Orlando they fired so many people and never even got them other jobs. And those secret underground tunnels lolll
This is what’s on the news? Give me a break
Sea World too, those theme parks make tourist not want to randomly go visit. Over crowded when you do go and pay for the “fast pass”. You’re 700 bucks in the hole for 1 day and 2 tickets into the park
As a kid disney never interested me.  I had discernment from the nappies.  For that i am grateful. Thank you Lord Jesus you saved me.
9 years ago, we spent 17 days going to Orlando parks including 8 days of Disney. Total cost was $6-7K including Uber fees, food, hotel, tickets, etc
Stay away from place it has been exposed.
Is Fox that bored??? Why tf you go if you wanna just go on the news how expensive it is
It all greed and I feel lighting passes are unfair letting other jump the line.  Making the wait longer. I boycotted them when I see a man dress like a fairy in front of their store.  He was not dress as  male fairy.
The reporter is a multimillionaire and can't relate so she just calls them poor over and over. 😂
I don't care about the Disney world is a woke Park and children get missing
They say it’s too expensive for most families however I see plenty of people there that don’t exactly look “rich.” I do know my brother in law went because he doesn’t have to pay for his own groceries due to food stamps.
America is a corporation, hold your coins
"Some people can't afford groceries or gasoline. At least it was in the last administration, it's gotten a little bit better." WHERE HAS IT GOTTEN BETTER?! Lol. Stop with the B.S!
Why did this end up on national news
When I was a Kid, we went nowhere, absolutely nowhere, and quite frankly, I didn't want to go anywhere. Home was great just as long as I had someone to play cricket with in the garden. I hope they enjoyed it. $1400 does not seem to be that much nowadays anyway. Might as well spend it as someone else will rip you off and end up taking cash out of your pocket at some stage anyway. Not sure why he is complaining either. It can't be cheap running a theme park. A trip to see Barringer crater would be a good idea or a trip to some other incredible natural phenomenon. The Big Country has plenty to see.
Just stop going, and half of their time spent in lane
Dad doesn’t get out much! Welcome to the real world!
I've lived in Florida my whole life and have been to Disney 1 or 2 times.   Try the beautiful beaches on both coasts which are free or the many fresh water springs in Florida!
Expensive for the creepiest place on Earth!
I will never take my kids there. Im not gonna pay that money and stand in line for hours
USA is not a place to live anymore! All services are way out of control! A single service call for any service ends up to atleast $600 and you'll end up calling up them couple of times a year as they will intentionally live stuff vulnerable so will end up making a call again in few months! HVAC, Plumber, Gen Contractors are special scammers! Everything else from Insurance, permits, etc.!! Can't wait to leave when i can!!
Not worth it.  Disney has wrecked their company in many ways.
That is a one month mortgage for some people.
$300 for parking??!!!!! That’s a rip!
What normal parent take kids to tacky place like this
Um, how is Disney going to pay for all those DVC properties, if not by the non-DVC guests, who will never, ever participate in anything DVC.
“Got a little bit better” lol ok😂😂😂
The greedy public own companies keeping us poor. The stock market goes up corporations making record high profits and working class getting poor.
You can only go 4 times a year if you’re a pass holder and also have to schedule 3months in advance. It’s horrible never go
I asked my kids if they wanted to go to Disney world. My son said "No Dad their woke"
300 to park why you didn’t stay at the resorts
You can only go 4 times a year if you’re a pass holder and also have to schedule 3months in advance. It’s horrible never go
if I ended up on the news with my dad talking about how expensive taking us to Disneyland was I would never ask for anything again💀
No one is being forced to go there. It’s a vacation not a mandatory appearance And you should know the tickets prices before you even go. They’re not hiding it. They’re in the business of making money.
My family plans on going next week
The child has no idea what the value of a dollar is
Also, it gives people a heads when you are trying to budget. Thank you.
Disney is overpriced and overrated. If it wasn’t because of my little girl and her love for the characters. 🤦‍♂️ Have you see their never updated light show at night? It looks like the 1990s light display.
What is the problem ?? If you don't got don't go
I flew to Disney and stayed for 4 days in their hotel and went to three parks and paid less for me and my wife. I would never pay full price. Disney’s not even that great
Your wife having a good time and you swiping the card is also a problem. Two incomes should come to equal payouts. Idgaf. But 99% of women will laugh and agree with your wife
Disney just isn't the place it used to be.  Ignore the cost for a moment.  You'll be spending the day with hot-sweaty masses, all stumbling around angry and confused trying to figure out the Disney app -- which you are REQUIRED to have / use for EVERYTHING except the toilets!  It's complicated, and comes with a fairly steep learning curve.  You'll have to pre-book / buy a place in line for most rides -- at least, the ones you'll actually wanna ride..  So, to summarize -- you'll pay a tidy fortune to sweat outside in the Florida summer with a bunch of strangers.  Pay even more to get on a few brief rides; then more again for some (actually pretty decent) food.  Oh, and then there's the lodgings....
We wouldn’t go to Disney World for Free! Never ever…
As a travel agent, I refuse to sell Disney. There’s too many dodgy issues surrounding Disney so I won’t support them.
Well, it's so expensive kids, can't even afford to go, i guess it's not kid friendly.
Disney is scam
Disney hates families.
...and people wonder why millennials are have 0-1 kid(s).
Kind of pricey. Parking used to be free. Tickets were high but AAA discount, or visit a timeshare for 2 hrs free ones. You get a discount if you’re local, or buying tickets for out of town guests (hint) Food was a little overpriced, but we ate in the park & then ordered pizza to the el cheapo mom & pop motel we stayed at for dinner. If you decide to stay at the expensive hotels, go to expensive restaurants, that’s gonna up the price A LOT.
That’s pretty much the cost of an apple phone ..
This guy used those 1.4k as an investment. With 8mil views, how much has he received in return?  Disney is for pleasure. It's not a basic need, so ppl know, before hand, how much they'll need.
If you think that's bad, trying adding a huge chunk more for foreign visitors due to currency exchange and it's even worse.
Disney going after kids when they were supposed to be kid safe went way, way over the line for millions of people. Get Woke, Go Broke.
Magic only the few can afford
Many of us wouldn't even consider giving Disney another dime in our lifetime. (Get Woke, Go Broke anyone?) Then they have these absurd prices at their parks.  What will Disney do next to alienate even more people?
Florida sucks..
If you can’t afford it, simply don’t go.   With a little research, you can go when it is off season.
And that if your local, no wonder why no one goes
ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Owned by China 🤣🤣🤣 keep spending that money and supporting communist China
Disney says they want to be inclusive... Yet, they exclude poor and middle class people.
Idiot still wearing Minnie ears and complaining about how much it cost…. This man must be a woman
It’s inflation! Disney got rent to pay too! and people ain’t coming as usual.
Their prices are available online, this isn't news
Has anyone attended a sporting event lately ? Or musical venue ?
If you plan to take your family to disney, pay for the bundle pack off their website. And i think they give you up to 24 months to use, so  when you get there, your room, ticket, and parking will already be paid for. And if the ride is covered in the package, all you will have to pay for is food and other things disney charges for. You might not save a whole lot of money, but you will save some with their package package deal.
You’re not pinching pennies if you can afford to take this trip.   No one feels bad for you buddy.
So its almost $200 a ticket and you wait in line for hours. So ehat you pay $10-20 per ride? No thanks!
My rent is $1400! I guess I’ll never be going to Disney World 😫
It's always been that way. It was very expensive 20 yrs ago when I took my kids. I never considered going back.
I will never return to Disney again! Oh hold on I’ve never been dumb enough to go in the first place.  If you’re dumb enough to waste your money standing in line just to try to be like everyone else why wouldn’t they overcharge?
Apparently they havnt went to monster jam lately. Parking in Detroit was $60
Look at Craig. Bigger than YouTube
Could have gone somewhere else just as nice and half the price. Florida has lots of things to see and do. If you're trying to pinch penneys Disney ain't it.🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Just don’t go
It’s not only that you get almost molested going through security which violates your fourth amendment rights . At the end of the day it’s not worth it .
ha wasnt expecting to see @flyingwheels
$1,400 🫨🤔 geezuz
Disney is not the same anymore even for Florida residents. Everything is overpriced
That’s really not as bad as I guessed. And this guy has a decent YouTube channel and automotive buisiness. He could do one job on a vehicle and have this $$.
Flying wheels is always complaining about how much money he loses selling cars now he is complaining about how much he is loosing going to Disney! 😂
Say thank you to Trump tariffs 😂🤡🤡
They won’t get a dime from me.
No one is going to see there woke trash movies so they got to makeup the money somehow...
And that's why I'm going to Disneyland in Japan. I'd rather spend the same amount and go to a different country for a family of three for 2 weeks!!
At this point, I wouldn't even let my kids watch Disney movies,let alone spend that kinda money to go to a theme park😂
Thoughts & Trump Tarriffs!! ... ENJOY Pahaaaa!!🤣🤣👍
Maybe you are not rich enough to take your kids to disney., please take them to national parks
Line Bob Igers pockets. Idiots.
974 for five people is cheap
Do Universal next time!
It has not gotten better. Why is she lying. Awful. It’s gotten worse
Jesus 1400 for a day??? I would make my car payment for 4 months with it
This is why I won’t go there anymore. It’s absurd.
These days it’s simply about catering to Disney Adults vs families unfortunately
Been there just once for the feel of it. Never going back. But that doesnt stop disney from price jacking coz there will always be new customers and kids being sentimental about disney.
You got 5 kids you idiot and you're going to coorporate play land.. 1k sounded cheap to me.. see the kid said it was packed so plenty ppl have 1k to spend on their kids...
People complain but yet they go
well don't go to Disney! duh
Even as a kid i thought Disney world sucked.... Nerver understood why ppl love it. The rides blow.
I hate long lines. Worst thing at Disney land besides the high costs.
Disney need to fund all their terrible movies no one wants to watch
🤯😣🤯😣
My boy flying wheels 🔥 learned a lot from your YT vids on flipping cars
It got a little better!?! Your whole story is that it didn’t. So dumb
Disney trip is not for all kids… it’s a show off
The last time we were at Disney World, my son was 8.  He'll be 38 in August.  It was too expensive then, and ridiculously expensive now.  We never went back, and don't miss it.
There are so many other memories that can be made for $1,400.
Waiting in line with my family ❤❤❤
Yeah Disney is no longer magical. Over priced hell 😂
It should be  affordable for all families! Not some families! Period!!
You're paying for 5 people. What the hell do you expect. Also everything else he's mentioning is optional. It's a theme park; what theme park have you ever been to since the beginning of time that sells things at a value.
Its outrageous!
4 days 3 Nights Florida Resident in 2024, party of 5 $5,000 😱😭😱😭😱😭
Ill never go to Disney. I would love to take my kids but its way too expensive and unaffordable.
But but but MAGA will save us. - some trump supporter
is disney that good?
Omg! I went in 2016 and paid no where near that for 4 days!
Ans that's on the cheap end
That’s so ridiculous ripping people off as usual
Outrageous. This is why I do not go to Disney World.  Rather go to Universal.
Getting punished for somewhere you wanted to go, the irony of some people 😂😂😂😂
Welcome to Trump’s America 2!  😢😢😢😢😢😢 Wait until the tariffs come 😢😢😢😢😢
Show your kids the outside the nature and animals! That's alot better.
Don’t let your kids watch Disney and they won’t ask to go there…😂
And her favorite thing was just talking with the family😂
I don't get the fascination with Disneyland or Disneyworld. Been there twice and have no desire to go back.
I live in MN and have been dreaming of taking my kids to Disney at some point while the "magic" is still real to them. They're 8 and 6 and every year that passes seems like that dream gets further and further away from ever becoming reality. I work all the OT I can, but it never seems to be enough
A lot of money for a short term trip.
I just spend 1500 for a family of 4 fast lane passes was a must
We haven't been to disney in 13 years. It's just gotten too ridiculous. We are a Universal family now.
It pains me to see the money wasted at these overpriced, overhyped parks!
Make sandwiches, go to the local park! $10.
Wow.  In 2017 I took my family of 3 to Disneyworld for 4 days/3 nights staying on the property.  I think the whole trip - including airfare from Arizona  - cost about $4k.  It’s probably a lot more now.
We planned a family Disney World trip this summer for 18 people. 6 kids and 12 adults. Booking alone is almost $60k.
This is good news because every day I do not take my family to Disney I come out $1400 ahead.
Used to be a season pass holder.....Haven't gone back since 2018
Honestly they should just skipped Disney world and went straight to Disney springs
I made a separate savings fund i started  when my girls were infants for Disney trips. Went twice with them once 7 and 3, then at 15 and 11 wouldnt trade the memories we made for the world!
That is so sweet! Good job, Kendall! The reason why we parents need to make time to spend and talk with our kids. It could be the greatest gift you can give them is..."TIME" ❤
He complains and still pay, go figure 🙄
Disney is ridiculous.  wait in line forever and their rides aren't even that great at all!  Give me a park like Cedar Point or Kings Island any DAY!  rollercoasters1  Disney is a rip off.  Some people save years for it.  It's just a bunch of concrete.
I went to Disney and even tho I was the only one to complain it went viral and I am famous!
Disneyland is the most overrated overpriced place I have ever been to.
Supplying demand make the price  cheaper and nobody will even be able to get into the parks. They will be so packed they need to make more parks
I remember dropping a ton of money to take my daughter to universal to see the Harry Potter world. It was like $900 just for our tickets and a two night stay package which is whatever. The prices inside the park were insane but thank god I had the money. After universal I planned to spend a couple days Ty along her to my childhood beach cuz she had never been to the beach before. For the next two days that’s ALL she wanted to do was be at the beach and it was her favorite part of the trip…
So sad to hear one of the iconic companies in America left behind what Walt wanted for the American family fun of being affordable for most of the people.  Personally, my family and I used to visit Disney's Parks 27 years in a row in Orlando, FL since 1982 (when Epcot opened its gates for the very first time) 'til 2019. Then, after the pandemic everything completely changed the company's vision becoming extremely expensive for a large part of us. I think Disney is out of control right now and they don't care American Family no more!
Man f Mickey mouse 😡
....last administration hahahah girl keep talking lol
Most familes can't afford Disney , but its packed out every week. 😮
I honestly cannot believe people still take their children to these Disney parks.
Yet u still paid
Good   You deserve that scam if you go through with it
It is capitalism. This is not news.
I just feel for all of the kids that don’t get to go, for whatever reason. 😢 I pray for all children to be able to have the opportunity to visit special places like that.
SO DUMB.  I'm a FL resident my whole life & always get the weekday annual pass now called the Pixie Pass around $500 each for the whole year & you have the option to buy half down & the other half in 12 monthly payments which is what I do.  I go with my mom to all 4 parks several times throughout the year & it's FREE PARKING every time.  And you can save a small amount at the sit-down restaurants & merchandise.  I don't buy much merch if any & usually buy one meal per day.  Much more affordable getting the annual pass.  It really pays for itself after one visit to each of the parks.  I go about every week & stay most of the day or the entire day every time.
If anything tickets are too cheap because it’s so packed. They need to raise the price, so it doesn’t become so busy
I have no sympathy.  Anyone that goes to Disney has to have some idea that it’s not cheap to go.  So when they get the bill they shouldn’t be surprised that a day there will be over $1000.
the most expensive pizza.  inside Disney  😢😢
😂 she said it’s gotten a little bit better we are about to go into tarrifarmahedon FOX will never admit defeat 🤣🫡🇺🇸🧠🧼
I don’t no how any fa can afford a trip to Disney
Probably should come up with some sort of rewards system or a free tablet idk 😂😭 1500 just about for being local resident
Don't eat at the restaurants
So the Father never done research prior to the trip? A trip to Disney and it's relationship to financial budget is a topic going back decades. There are countless reviews to read, reviews to watch online, social media feedback and any physical conversation can spark the topic of what to expect for a  budget, even Dave Cheppelle has a joke about "Disney dollars". This is ignorance at best.
You took 5 people to a theme park…with meals and everything included. What did he expect?  Same price or more at universal. Or take them to a dolphins game, heat game.  Same price or more.   Companies have to raise prices in the park to purposefully drop demand.  Imagine if the prices were $20 per person per day.  The parks would be soooooo swamped with people it would be the worst experience possible.  And people are already complaining about the lines as is…it would be 20x worse.
Go to Russia . Looks .
USA is a complete rip off on everything. bottled water cost more than gasoline
Shoulda invested in bitcoin instead!!!
That's why other countries are more affordable, people would rather take there money elsewhere
Shame on Disney…for ALL of their greed and twisted shenanigans!
One reason I never went to that place, is a money void where wallets go to die.
Don’t go if you are poor. Problem solved
they say inflation is a real thing. No, everyone just charge what they want.
“Under the last administration. At least it’s gotten better..” How’s it gotten better? 😂
FLORIDA residence should buy a annual pass to Disney if they still sell them. One way to beat the high cost and eat before you go.
Disney movies tanking so they rely pretty much on the theme parks to offset all the losses and make profits and keep shareholders from leaving en masse.
Dad stressed out! I feel you! Rent/mortgage OR Disney 😩
I don’t understand how or why people are still going there!
Come on in here Disney adults with yall stupid asses, Gots some Explaining to do! I remember being able to go to Disney with $20 for a ticket
Don’t go to Disney. If you all stop paying guess what. They will drop the price, what did they do with games?? Oooo yeah they shut down buildings cause the gamers stopped buying WOKE trash.
My ❤ for these Family😊
$1500 for a family of 5 at Disney for the day isn’t that unreasonable, not saying it’s not pricey but I thought it was gonna be more …  I think we need to normalize that a fun experience doesn’t have to be Disney but a walk or something even at home
Ask Trump to make a post on it to see if Disney will lower costs...I'm curious what will happen😅😂
Thats why i wont go and dont care about supporting Disney, as long as they continue woke
I bet he told his kids we're not going to be eating for a week maybe I should have been smarter and put that money towards home stuff because of Donald Trump and his tariffs
After moving to Brasil where the USD goes 5.6 further on a bad day... I can't imagine spending over $1k on anything other than house expenses or health emergencies.
If you don’t buy the lighting pass be ready to stand in hot sun for each ride for over an hour!
I was planning to visit Disney World and saw the amount of money I had to pay so we went to Seaworld instead.
Girl. People are still struggling to buy groceries, even more so now. Where do you live?!?!
Can you imagine what a non-resident would have cost?
Glad my kids are grown up.  Kids can go to Dollywood and have a less expensive and more wholesome experience.  These amusement parks like Disney and epcot center all charge an arm and a leg and back the park with restaurants and toy shops so you spend more.
Universal studios is better and cheaper😊
I just went to disney. Starting price for it is like 1400$. After everything was like 2k+. They now link your card to a tap card so you and your kids tap it and by the end of the day all thr money is gone.
Disney sucks
Should of went to 6 flags instead
I have never been to Disney. It's so sad that Disney costs that much!
Wait…… The cost is the only thing people are complaining about?
This is why I will NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER EVER go to ANY Disneyland parks!!!!🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Flying Wheels!!!
At least this Dad will make money off of his social networking/influencing and YouTube views. What about everyone else who doesn't have a revenue stream to make up for the ridiculous pricing for standing in lines all day and paying outrageous prices for food, trinkets and lodging?
Its sad how its gotten... when i was a kid we went to Disney world ALOT.. we all used to get annual passes and stayed at fort wilderness cabins for weeks at a time... we were a average lower income family in Florida. Now as an adult who makes more then my parents did i cant afford to take my daughter to Disney for one day. Its insane how much they've increased everything  You used to get free parking and free fast passes if you were just staying at a Disney hotel now everything cost additional money and its all crazy expensive. The value just isn't there. Go to universal studios instead way more value for the month
Disney have no shame of over charging poor people all this money. 😢
you want a build back better hat i see
Defund Disneyland and world  STOP GOING WAKE UP AMERICA 🇺🇸 😒 😑
Extortion
Why would you want to go to a place where a man dresses up like a princess?  You better off going to Disney in Arab country where that is not allowed.
We stopped going YEARS AGO!
So he failed to plan…..got it  Hopefully his business makes it 🙏🏾
Trump said americans will be rich ! Are you rich yet ? No, wait it will get worse 😂😂😂😂
Wait did she just say the administration had gotten a bit better, is she trying to make corporate greed a political thing? This is incredibly manipulative, the real problem is corporate America
Where dreams come true 😂❤
“It’s called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it” - George Carlin
I'm planning a trip for my son's 6th birthday to Disney and even booking in advance with a deal it's $2k.. Anything for our kids, though 🥴😂
People come from every walk of the Earth to see this mouse. Meanwhile,  I'm to keep mice out of my house. GO FIGURE!!!!!!
I was there the day that it opened in October 1971 and it was FREE to get in but you had to buy ticket books for the rides and if I’m not mistaken they were around $7.00 for 50 tickets – something like that.   They got rid of the tickets shortly thereafter and then it was like $9.00 per person per day or a 4 day pass for $25.00 both of which included unlimited rides.
Lost me with your woke DEI crap
this is exactly why i’ve never been to Disney land even as a child and I was born in 96’.
And now imagine that most people will probably put this on credit cards.  So, that $1400 could easily be $1800-2200 or more depending how fast you pay it off.  Parks will keep charging these prices as long as suckers keep paying them.
This is so dumb! Disney has always been expensive. It's not supposed to be a cheap trip.  Keep focusing on the real American struggle Fox.... families are struggling to pay essential bills and you highlight a well-off family that can afford to take a family of 5 across the country on vacation.
Lmao stay home then
Now Disney is going to comp him and his family for the rest of the year for spin control. Good for his family. Nothings going to change for the rest of us 🤷🏾‍♂️
Stupid woke Disney 👎🏻👎🏻 overpriced
People making 15 bucks an hour don't go to places like this.  Greed,it's stupid and pathetic.  You won't catch me paying Disney 1 dollar!! Or any other amusement robbery park
Here is how Fox attacks a company that defends human dignity and LGBTQ rights. Fox tries to hit them in the pocketbook buy running this skewed story. Nobody knows what kinds of tickets this guy purchased, what kind of food he ordered for his big family, or the types of restaurants they ate at. This guy wants to play a victim after he chose to go to Disney World. All Fox wants to do is scare people away from something, as usual. The grinch network for ignorant, scared people.
DONT GO THERE. THEY ARE INVOLVED WITH CHILD TRAFFICKING. PEOPLE YOU NEED TO WAKE UP. THEIR DISNEY SHOWS ARE SATANIC. LOOK UP SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES IN DISNEY MOVIES. IF I KNEW WHAT I KNOW NOW YEARS AGO I WOULD HAVE NOT STEPPED INTO DISNEY WORLD.
I feel like we get the ball rolling in a class war if everyone stops going to Disney. Just full stop. Clearly it's not worth it anymore
The last time I went to Disney World, every father I saw with their families looked beyond stressed out and sad. It's really not worth it.
Daddy said imma get my money back 😂😂
1400 not bad 😂😂...if you save for a year or two that is ok for a Florida resident.
Greedy cooperate poo stains. That's me trying to be polite about it
Can't blame Disney though, supply and demand set these prices.   In fact, sad reality is that Disney could probably set the price is higher and while less people would go, some people would still pay the increased premium to attend a less crowded theme park.
I think he overpaid.  I'm from California and I went to Disneyworld last summer for 3 day and a party of 5.  3 day tickets was $303/person and there's lots of quick service food for $12-20 per person and they give free water everywhere.
It’s so stupidly out of control. It’s the antithesis of Walt Disney’s dream for a safe, clean park that would be accessible to every family who wanted to come. This company has been corrupted from the inside out. We need to some of the old guard back at the reigns. The woke garbage and excessive greed and mismanagement has been devastating.
I don't go to  that crap. Many good places to go in the country.
lol Fox News always bringing up politics in their news. Previous adminstartion this blah blah blah
Trump effect 👍
Everything is getting stupid, I took my nephews to Dave and busters just to play games. We didn't even go there to eat, 300 plus dollars to play in an arcade... What the hell is going on man. That's ridiculous
I don't consider $1400 family friendly
It's an amusement park, are you amused?
So you payed 300$ per person for the whole day? Thats pretty normal and  Euro disney would be 400$ so whats the point @fox?
People still go out and spend money these days🤯🤯
I wouldn't go to WOKE land
It’s very simple….. don’t go there 🤷🏻‍♂️
I live in Florida. Disney is probably 45 minutes from me. I have no desire to sit in that I4 traffic to get there to waste money at that place. I’d rather ride my motorcycles and head for areas without people.
My friend took his grandkids there a few months back.  I thought he was exaggerating about the prices.  Now I see he wasn't.  That's really crazy what they charge.
This has been going on for years.  It's nothing new.  Spoiler alert: if you pay it, they will continue to gouge.
Did she really say “it’s gotten a little better now”? I need to smoke whatever she is smoking 😂
Disney is boring after going the 2nd time long lines so annoying for a 1 min ride
Bro could have went to Cancun with the lakers and save $400
I'm independent,  but in what alternate universe have costs gotten a little better now?
Disney is overrated.
I'm gonna have a talk with Mickey bout this!
BEEN TO DISNEY WORLD ABOUT 10 TIMES, WOULDN’T SPEND A DIME ANYMORE ON THE WOKE .
Liberal increased the price! Not trump our savior!
That’s cheap for having 18 kids
Never been there I don't care if I was a millionaire I will never be there.
Disneyland is an luxury park. They are trying to weed out the poor.
Disney is so overrated and I don't understand the adults that are obsessed with it. Go to six flags or somewhere decent instead
If you don't have money, then don't go! There is no right to visit Disney. It's a privilege. Go to the beach! Kids prefer the beach anyway. Maybe it's the idiot parents who really want the Disney photo , social media posts.
The young ladies answer of the question of her favorite part really hit me we don't have enough interaction as a family unit anymore thanks to cell phones and social media.
They need to charge obscene prices......how else are they going to be able to pay their executives obscene compensation packages........
It’s a Disney theme park, not a McDonalds play area.  You have a family of 5.  What are you expecting?  $1,400 is not that bad.
Ill never go there!
Disney is absolutely insanely expensive. I definitely don’t think it’s worth it in my opinion.
To price the riff-raff out!
Hes a dumb dad for not realizing it at first. I have gone their twice i got 4 little kids. I can no longer afford to go  their anymore. Its insane
I hope the second mortgage was worth it.
Disney Land is stupid. I don't feel obligated to take my kids there at all. Nor do they want to go. It doesn't even exist in their world
Why would anyone support Disney at this point?
Wow. His daughter's answer about her favorite part of the trip was very surprising. She's a good kid. That was heartwarming.
I don't have small kids anymore. But I wouldn't spend that kind of money either. A couple of hundred for a truck of BBQ foods a couple of hundred for some backyard fun stuff like a sprinkler head and water fun toys and whatever they have nowadays and everyone has a good time. If they need Disney a couple of videos will have to do
Go camping.... Traveling the world is actually cheaper. Go to Thailand, the Philippines, or even Vietnam. So much to do. Cheap stays and activities are at a smallest fraction of the costs than Disney parks.
Its basically tripled since covid, especially when you include all the stuff that USED to be included in the cost.
Why didn't he get a family deal for a 3 day trip? Sounds like he's never been to Disney world before. It's not very wise to go to Disney world for one day. And it's much cheaper to stay on their property, where you won't worry about parking and the traffic. And you can navigate through the Disney park much earlier!❤❤ No perhaps not cheap, but every $ you spend you won't mind if planning in advance. 😊
Yeah don't go.
Sad kids can’t enjoy fun things like Disneyland anymore unless they have rich parents, we are going into poverty as a Nation because of greed!
That's like a month's salary for Canadians 😖
Not how you pinch pennies.
im  sure  he will  just pass the cost to his  customers.
Don't get it... he knew the prices before going
Talking at the dinner table is free 😂
They need to double the prices.    Keep the crowds and the riff raff out.
Nah fr we went recently and it’s like things are ridiculously priced just for the sake of it. No reason a bottle of water should cost $4-5 bucks. We ate at Disney Springs. Family of 4 came out to around $200.
Stopped purchasing anything Disney once we learned they went woke. Will never spend another penny on this business. Take your family to the Ark in Kentucky much better entertainment and a spiritual experience.
Disney dont like white ppl. Boycott the wokies
Invest in VR, be anywhere.
$300 for parking 🅿️ I will never complain about prices at Canada’s Wonderland again
It is all part of corporate America’s policy to empty the pockets of their customers.
Man disney is expensive like who wouldn’t want to go, I guess the only way to look at it is once in a lifetime experience
See where he messed up was if he stayed for a week, it probably would’ve only cost $1,350 a day and they slept in there car/ on property probably another 8k 🤯
Go to Bush Gardens in Tampa
At no point in history have people ever said, “A Disney vacation is cheap”. Are prices not posted online?
Well, I guess Money can buy Happiness now huh, atleast for the kids going to Disneyland
Theres a reason why so many people work there. So they can get their family and friends in for free.
Well the lines are still long and the park is always packed. Obviously the prices are Not high enough yet. 🫤
Well, gee, Disney has to remodel their tunnels. You can’t traffic kids in a   smelly old tunnel
CROOKS Boicot this corporations
Growing up in So Cal in the 70s and 80s, I’m glad I got my Disneyland fix out of the way. Fond memories but I don’t think I’d step into any Disney park today.
Anyone who is not a sheep will not give Disney a dime.
They hate you ...
Yes, Disney has absolutely priced out the middle and lower class. But, having gone for 35 years -- went in January for a week and a few days last week -- you never go for a day. Stay off site. Don't Hop or Lighting Lane. And MINIMUM 4 days. (Really, you need at least 2 days per park.) Plus, bring in your own snacks/drinks and only do quick-service with the app. And I will say that, as much as I 110% understand the criticism and dish it out given my long-term relationship with the Mouse, there is sooooooooooo much to do at Disney. Yea, the prices are high. But my goodness there really is just tons of stuff going on everywhere all the time. Like, a normal 2hr concert can be over $100 for a ticket. A day pass can be $150+, sure, but you can get nearly 12hrs of stuff to do. You'll feel like you got hit by a bus because the available content is exponential. It's impossible to even see 25% of it all even in a few days. Plus, the elephant in the room: this dude is a FL resident. Why the heck didn't he get annual passes? Or the FL tix special? Disney still takes care of FL peeps very well. He's partially to blame for the clickbait. And eating at Disney Springs? When you should be in the Park? No no no. Other variables: he went to Hollywood Studios. Based on date/day, lines can be double. I went to HS on 5/5 (a dreaded Monday) and yea -- it was busy. But that's because it was Star Wars weekend. I still put in 10hrs and made pretty good time even with (inflated) wait times. Anywho, it IS possible to do Disney on a budget. Just not like pre-2016. Gone are the days of the average family going every couple years. Unless you are going in debt or are flat-out wealthy, you are going every 5-10 years. And that's what they want. Less people paying more.
Society has convinced young parents that they MUST take the kids to Disney. We fell for it 30 years ago. It was a colossal waste of time and money back then. Even more so now. Wake up America!
Disney is NOT worth that much!
My family has had enjoyable days at State Parks -- Wekiva Springs, Blue Springs, and Silver Springs-- and eco cruising the St Johns River-- parking is nominal, the employees are nicer, and picnic lunches are cheaper and healthier
Yeah my family could never afford to go to Disney when I was growing up, and 32 years later we still can't afford it 😂
Last time I went to Disney world it was $50 a ticket
How many trannys were staring down your children?
My family are of 5, we spent $15k for 5 days. This was few yrs back, worth every pennies
Buy him an ultrasaber  its better  trust me
it's worth every penny.
You pay for woke when you go to Disney
it’s packed with THESE PRICES!!!
Go on the off season 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Go figure it would be Donald Trump favorite news station reporting on Disney
We are all trying to pinch pennies  pays 1400 bucks for a disney trip 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Stop complaining you can clearly  afford it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂 disnet has always been expensive
Busch Gardens is better.
Stop going!!!!! This is the only way to stop it! If he put that money in a S&P 500 index fund imagine how much that would be for the two children in 20 years!
Im a native from Florida i stopped taking my family to disney 6yrs ago i now just get a hotel and pool and thats our getaway and have saved way much more!! Disney is ridiculous
Tell me your broke with out telling me your broke
“It’s gotten a little bit better”🧐
I will NEVER Return to Disney Again.
It’s called supply and demand.  You said it was packed, so people are willing to pay the exorbitant prices.  Don’t blame Disney, blame the millions of visitors will to go into debt to pay for that experience.  If they lacked the visitors, the price would come down. Economics 101.
I was at Disney last month and every thing he said is exactly true from the long lines to the crowded place to eating out i’m talking about everything last month experience was one hell of experience for me and I must say Disney is expensive as hell just for one day. My son only got to get on three rides out of the whole entire day. We were there and we got there at 9:30 and didn’t leave until 8 o’clockthat night.
That’s ridiculous!!! The rich will keep getting richer & the poor continues to get even poorer!
this is what happens when people make too much money = inflation. there has not been a recession since 2008.
I'll never go there again. Rip off.
Boycott Disney
The way she kept looking at her dad for confidence and reassurance. She was nervous being on tv.
0:20 people forgot what "literally " means.
That’s BS.  Can’t even take your kids to Disney.  Mickey Mouse isn’t that cool!
Disney for a family vacation is a thing for the rich and famous not for the normal family with normal family values... No homo
They said the park was "so busy with long lines". Guess there is enough people to pay. Must be priced correctly...
Someone has to pay for Snow Shite and the Seven idiots movie.
Will never go to Disney again. What a joke. Its radically changed since I was a kid.
Disney is so out of touch with its consumers anymore.  As our of state visitors we go every year and it can be done cheaper, relatively, for us. We can go for 5-7 days an spend less than $4500, which is still pricey, but doable .
I know him hes a yt car dealership
The five of us went to Disney World in 2004.  The total cost for round trip flight, stay on-site 5 nights, fast pass tickets, souvenirs, food, etc...was around $5000 to $6000. It was worth it then.  Now it's tripled, twice as crowded, and not worth it.  Disney is not the same.
I can go on a week long cruise for that price!
Disney is a alphabet mafia scam
Anyone buying that favorite part bs... Stop
It doesn’t matter what administration it is. Inflation is real.
And this is news because… it’s not a secret how expensive Disney is, it was always expensive. Do people know how much its costs to maintain rides and employees skilled workers who maintain them or how much it cost to keep the park as pristine it is.  You pay for the experience. Funny though watching Americans complaining about capitalism, irony at its finest. Yet these same people voted in the biggest blow hard “businessman”.
That’s why I’ll never have kids lol. I like spending the money I work hard for on myself lmaooo.
i'd bribe the child with a playstation5 or promise of 6  and games with a jet ski romp. or Disney..... He would of still had left over money.
I would never pay for a trip to Disney world it's insanely expensive only rich assholes could afford
So out of touch.
@2:15 “…It’s gotten a little bit better.” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Born in Tampa in 1973, raised in Tallahassee since 1975 and haven’t been to Disney since high school grad night. I haven’t been there with my family since I was probably in middle school. My daughters are in their mid thirties and have never asked once to go so we never went. To much stuff to do in Florida that Disney isn’t in the top 100 things to do here.
Yes, but additional days become the price point and more "reasonable." F him. Loser looking for attention.
Imagine if Walt was alive to see this?
Yeah, we were looking at going to Disney but we can't afford it. It's like 5600 for us
Disney said they will continue to raise the prices as long as people are willing to pay. Stop going and the prices will drop.
This man does not speak for average Americans....it's just BS so he can get more content on his platform..
1. Why would he buy tickets on the spot? Online discounts are the way to go (book well in advance).   2. The parking of $30 was still way better than what we paid for a cab because we thought we would ‘save money on car rentals’ 😂 So no complaints there.   3. Food prices at these places is a scam, but can’t be avoided 😢   And Universal isn’t much better. 😫😖
Never been to disney and never will
Why is he on national news for paying for something he knew he didn't want to pay for?
Just no.
Been to Disney 3 times. All I see is young kids crying the entire time. If I were the dad I’d be pissed lmfao
gotta pay for all those miserable disney movie projects that constantly fail miserably at the box-office . disney is woke as hell and keeps dumping your money into the DEI pit of hell .
No sympathy for this guy used car sales has channel showing how he rips people of
yep
Disney is a luxury. If you cant afford to go then you dont go. People spend $1400 on good tickets to an NFL game. People just want to complain because it’s Disney, the highest level of theme park.
The fact that he spent $1400 at Disney which means he HAS $1400 to spend at Disney. Ppl spend money on what they want to spend money on and complain about spending money on things they have to.
That’s not bad at all. When me and my gf go to a six flags it’s like $600-700 for 2. We get the fast passes though.
People will complain but keep going 😂😂😂😂
That’s crazy !!!!, it’s no way in the world it should cost that much money to go there !!!, this country is def a capitalist society !!!!!
NO ONE is surprised by this. Idiots and rich folk take their child to Disney.
Garbage. Disney sucks.
That's insane
Man translation: “I didn’t enjoy the trip, nor did I think it was worth the money, but I did it to make my family happy” 😂
I really can not believe they got out of there for $1,400!  If they were not Florida residence, it would’ve been more than that !
Disney has always been a rip off , most people who go , will never return . Universal they say is better .
And they let social media influencers in for free WITH free food 😢
She could have stayed home & talked to her family -___-
Why is this even news?
The little girl gave the kind of answer that makes a father happy they spent $1500 for one day. God bless you all 🙏
i took 4 adults an one kid two jumped the fence while i paid for 2 adults an one kid all day cost me $40.00 the 2 that jumped the fence were seen in the parade playing insturments we ate food panhandled an left at midnight 1980
I cannot afford to just take myself to Disney.
My children will never set foot in that cesspool?
Ds is a scam.
I’m sure Walt Disney is rolling over in his grave
“Waiting in the lines was the best part”?  😂😂. The kid is adorable but if the family is reporting it to the news, the price tag obviously took all the fun out of it.
What a moron . You would have to have a sub 80 iq to willingly take your children to a place to be indoctrinated, then pay them 1000 dollars. This small business owner is probably the same kind that refuses raises regularly because things are tight . Owth
Sporting events are like this. I took my family to a rangers game-between tickets, food, nick nacks for the kids, we spent almost $1500 in one night!  Out of control
Well they have to make up for Rachel and their woke sentiment that’s put them in the negative.
Tragic, the daughter liked waiting in the long lines for the family time of communication.  We have become so disconnected due to numerous distractions, that we are no longer connecting as human beings.
Dude got Hosed..
Nothing on adventure world Perth west Australia 😂
Just don’t go dude
Just don't go!
Never been I've had family friends take a Disney vacation and spend 15k  and go every couple of years.
Stop making babies
I went to Disney World once.    ONCE.
Imagine all that standing in line and then they them princess walks over to you with a 5:00 shadow.
I will not do Disney I will not support Disney. No interest in Disney. I go to university studios and I love it. I've never had that bad of a time as this guy.
Here I thought Craig (Flying Wheels YouTube) was from New Hampshire.
Trump's inflation
Yall get rip off, stop supporting places that over charges yall
Disney is for 2 kinds of people, rich people, and broke people.
People can’t afford to go to Disney? Why is it so crowded. It use to be fun to go but now it’s just a stressful over crowded mess.
I am from Australia, recently took my wife to Japan for 10 days, flight + Hotel + Food + Theme parks = $2300 USD
Everyone should boycott Disney, then after a while they will start lowering the prices.  I say don't buy anything disney ,don't watch it on TV, don't go there, make them go bankrupt.    Disney treated my family like crap and they are very racist and I'm white.ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS ONE THING.          MONEY.
People NEED to quit pocket watching and let people enjoy their money and family.  All it shows is your envy and jealousy.  If you get to grinding and saving and less hating, you can enjoy nice trips or vacations as well.
besides the cost who in their right mind still goes to Disney? so they can teach their kids that they're males when they're really females?
I remember camping in tents in the State parks was our big trips because we didn’t have a lot of money. Camping in a tent in Florida now, as an adult terrifies me now because I am ‘aware’ of alligators & snakes & big bugs!  Gg to Disneyin the ‘off season’ for us Florida residents, even with the discounted (🙄) tickets for residents is high.  Taking your own snacks, drinks into the park is prohibited I believe so you are forced to purchase even water because it is necessary to keep hydrated in the heat!  I would suggest to those wanting to visit Florida to try Busch Gardens or other theme/famiy activities in Tampa  Bay or another theme park because the deals are MUCH BETTER!  Orlando/! Kissimmee are money holes
Disney & the rip off passes are garbage 🗑 I wouldn't go for free
Hearing this is as bad as hearing we must tip for everything now now. Have we noticed that we have to tip for everything now. And it’s like requiring now 😂😂😂😂 it’s no longer a gesture it’s a requirement.
It's not worth it anymore....
Shiiiiiiii. Im goin ta Dollywood
More parents should share these real life experiences.
Sure cash cow dad, it wasn't 85% on credit. lmao
No thats what I pay for cars.
If disney is needing my money, too bad for disney.
Shoe your kids our historical parks and landmarks.
Notice how she had to mention the last administration? Journalism is so sad.
As a father of 2 teenage daughters and 10 year old son,that last answer from the daughter,made that money well spent by dad
I remember when my dad, uncle, younger brother and I stood in line to watch the original release of Star Wars. I was 15 and never saw my dad so pumped up to see a movie. It was a long line and it was the largest screen in the region. We sat close enough where the screen fitted perfectly in the peripheral vision. The whole screen filled the view! The final scene where the fighters flew down the trench was stunning. It felt like you were in the spacecraft. And my head felt weird as they flew in. It was an awesome experience. The best part, was standing in line and talking to my dad and uncle before the movie.  Saw Smokey and the Bandit on that screen too. That was a fun movie. Saw it with my best friend and his family. I learned from these experiences that the most important time with your kids is spending time communicating with them. Talking about life and wisdom. And being part of their lives.
What a total rip off bad food bad everything
Disney rip people off, and kidnap kids, just Google how many children go missing at Disney every year. I wouldn't let any children in the place. 🇮🇪
Do something meaningful for free. There, problem solved.
I will not go to Disneyword. It is very expensive not worth it.  Sometimes its not the children its the mom's who are spoiled. They want their families to dress alike thats money. I went one time it was so boring. I thought there will be lots of rides but no lots of walking. The attractions r nice i give a thumbs up. You better go to Universal Studio more rides worth the money.
Coming to gaza,  remember the j3ws love money.
Dudes a crybaby and over exaggerates every thing who didn't see that coming
He’s a white, American straight man who has the funds in his bank account. He’ll be okay.
I’m currently at LegoLand and it was $1,100 for two nights including park tickets.
You know the saying “ money makes the world go round “ it’s all about money and how much you can make. Sadly for many families it’s not affordable.
American gluten greed is why. Your idiot president will hammer you fools with tariffs that you just lack basic intelligence to understand that it’s a tax that yiu minions will pay, ha ha.
Disney has destroyed its own brand by overbuilding, overcharging and overcrowding Disney world. We use to go every year for 30 years but when they started to go woke they stated to go broke! We haven’t been since 2017 and I doubt will be going back and I can easily afford to pay $1000 per day but I won’t!
You couldnt pay me to take my kids to that place.
Disney should be ashamed of themselves.
Funny that his small business is luxury cars and they're trying to convince us of this relatability. They didn't get the lightsaber but this video doesn't mention everything else they got. People who are on a budget don't go to Disney and buy bottled water, soda, and ice cream from there. They certainly don't eat at the restaurants. We pack peanuts butter and jelly in lunch coolers and walk our budget behinds back to the parking lot for lunch! I took my 2 kids to Disney for one day and didn't even spend $400. I didn't buy one thing in the park, we packed juiceboxes and crackers. My kids aren't crazy, they know we don't buy $6 sodas and $40 bubble wands. But all these people are out here doing it, don't see how you can complain when Disney didn't force those extras on you.
The only place people will pay thousands to stand in line for 85% of their vacation.
Keep voting against your interests, working really well, isn't?
Just had to jab “the last administration “… really? My life is just as expensive now.
If you spend time/money/energy on a Disney trip...you a soulless subhuman and I hope it's a bad trip lol
A trip to national park or Europe would be a better option. Disney is all marketing for parents!
This is obnoxious
Slow news day? Desperate to get on TV? Someone finding out what everyone else knew already.
And besides the cost, Disney is full of LGBT people, not a good example for kids.
Dads a loser! When u pick somewhere to travel at the last minute. U will pay the price. I paid 1600 for a family of 4 to go to Disney for 5 days.. plan ahead! Plus there are way better places to take your kids.
Their trying to make up for the money they lose on movies..
You pay through the nose as Disney needs to make up for all the woke movies they release, that nobody watches, losing Disney billions!
😮 thanks not going to Disney.
Then don't go. You're funding the brainwashing of our youth with horrible ideology. They can stop pushing their political agendas and produce movies for the youth.
If the rich small business owner is complaining about going to Disney theme park and puts the bill on his credit card for over $1,400.00 and doesn't enjoy the cost then why go in the 1st place to advertise the price gouge on Fox News because Disney is not going to lower the cost when the demand is still ongoing.Its all about supply & demand -economics 101.Duh!
Hes trying to pinch pennies ?  He put the trip on youtube and that probably paid for most of it.
that amount of money could be spent better. Trip to italy, really nice restaurant by the seaside.😊
Who , you should go too european Parks,  there better , and mabey cost 100 euro , with your kid and your wife
"My wife was having a grand ole time" Aint that the truth lol
My dad took us in the 80s and that was probably the cost for us for the entire week
Wouldn't pay five dollars to go to Disney.
I was a single mum. I never could afford to bring them to Disney. I worked 2 jobs s to pay the bills . No vacations for us.
At least under the last administration … it’s gotten a little bit better 😂😂😂😂 WOW 🤯
Don't do it, ain't no way I'm h.e. dubble hockey 🏒🏒
That’s ridiculous. $30 just to park… pure greed
This is why my family and I went once, and that it, while my kids was old enough to remember, because we are not going back😂
I spend that at Magic city😂😂😂
So the lesson here Dad is stand still & talk to you daughter & save $1.400 😄
Sorry Disney, I cannot afford to ever go to any of your parks and cruises. ☹
Those tariffs not going to help under this new administration too😂😂😂
Amusement parks were never my thing. I prefer the county fair 🎠🎡🎢
Concrete jungle is expensive please to go to
I don’t care if Disney is woke but the woke prices need to go
F Disney, they lost it a long time ago. don't support them and the filth they push to children period.
Let's blame it on Biden, like we do everything else
I think Disney should take the consequence of this situation, and let Uncle Scrooge figures walk around everywhere, just to symbolize what the park has evolved into.
This is what Bidenflation and Democrats bring us.
$300 per, for a day, what’s wrong?
Disney parks are so artificial. A visit to a national park is much more rewarding.
Disney is just trying to regain the big money that they have lost after becoming woke-left. Republicans should BOYCOTT EVERYTHING DISNEY!
My family has been here since the 1950s and I think between myself growing up in the 70s, my wife whos lived here since the 70s when she was a baby and our 2 kids, in total, our family has been about 4-5 times. We live in Ft. Myers 4 hours away. It was $1000+ for a day for the 4 of us the last time we went 10-11 years ago. But all the parks are like that, Busch Gardens, Universal etc. All of the parks used to do promotions like other smaller local amusement parks in other states for their residents "bring a coke can for $15 tickets" or whatever, but thats been at least 20 years or so since they've had anything like that. We're the 3rd most populous state now with 22 million full time residents so they don't need to do it. And we just don't go.
While Fox anchor Ainsley Earhardt earns her $12,000 per day, and while Disney rakes in $1400 from one dad for one day, How much does Disney pay its employees?
Sadly Disney is for the well-off and rich people...my kids have been wanting to go so badly but we just couldn't afford it..we're a low income family ...
More and more ppl are taking loans just to go to Disney world. Walt is turning in his grave rn. This is not the vision he had.
As long as there are people willing to pay that much and be taking for a sucker, that place will keep ripping families off, stop visiting and prices will come down.😊
When are people going to wake up.  The characters are to lure families in.  Then the children want the toys making parents made to feel guilty.  The whole park is fast food rubbish and endless shops selling the same things over and over.  I went with my family.  The arguments we had got us to breaking point.  I was sick of I want from my kid and the patronising have a nice day from the young staf with a fixed grin   The whole park is a constant “ celebration “ of separating you from your money.   Never ever again
Calculate what we have to spend to get into Disney/Universal from the Netherlands these days. Last time my creditcard collapsed. Not fun anymore.
I went when I was a kid I hated it
Holly, s it 😮.
🤠
Disney movies are such a failure they're attempting to recoup their losses from their theme parks. Take your family to any American national park over Disneyworld/land.
Why cant California be that cheap. I went to look up how much would it cost for me and my family just for the tickets it came up almost to $2800 just for 2 days.
«Its gotten a little bit better»😂😂😂
Capitalism is about supply and demand. If the park was so packed as they say, Disney can afford to raise it even higher. It's the consumers' fault
Here’s the thing about Disney. Disneyland is even worse in LA. The whole thing about Disney, I don’t think it’s all that fun tbh. I know adults go without kids, like teenagers and stuff. I just don’t see it. It’s certainly fun, kids love it no doubt. For me, I’d much rather spend an entire day at an amusement park like Cedar Falls, Great America etc
Destroying his daughters day of Disney by complaining about the cost. Lovely memory....lol
The girls respond “waiting in lines” was her favorite part 😭😭 that’s tragic. The dad felt that. 💔
Disney parks in other countries are way cheaper than in the US! Tokyo Disneyland is only $70 to get in!
Stop blaming corporates. Customers are willing to pay so they deserve olit
Doesnt matter. Idiots will be idiots like this dad. Disney posted record profits for their streaming service and parks. It all makes sense now lmao. I cut my subscription when they raised the price. Guess many didnt. Good luck people.
This guy chose to take his family there. No sympathy for him.
Nah sweet but if my kid said that I’d never take us anywhere other than Walmart again 🤣
For people that work and live at indonesia. 1400 $. Is like 5 months of work
0:23 What did they eat? 😂
did you think it was going to be cheap?
Very sad, as a born and raised Orlando baby…. Walt Disney didn’t want Disney to be the money machine it is today, he wanted it to be an affordable place for average families to make memories 😢
Braver man than me to be a father in this day & age in America.
Where they able to try out Walts  original crack pipe collection?   From 1954?
Did he not check the ticket prices online beforehand?
F disney!!! Dont go there then! duh
It’s because Disney went woke.
Fuk Disney and there propaganda. I like there old old stuff before not the new woke crap.
Good job dad 👏
CANCEL DISNEY!!!! disney is not the same disney we used to have😢😢😢
I’ve gone 3 times with family and won’t go ever again. It’s the biggest ripoff. Better to go on a beach vacation and it will be way better
L  am from Canada  I would not even think of this ! Ths
We took our son to Disney when he was five years old twenty five years ago. When he saw how expensive the entry price was he told my husband and I we could do something else that day. Well we paid and he had the most miserable time of his life. He told my aunt that Mickey Mouse took all of our money.
The happiest place on earth,?. Disney laughing all the way to the bank
He's from Massachutes and is on youtube he is a used car salesman "flying wheels" he bought a home in Florida 1 year ago.
Guys if you’re reading these comments and thinking 🤔 I’m not going to go now.. let me share.. Disney is absolutely worth it🤷🏽‍♂️ it is! I don’t like the price but it is! Guys pay 500 and 1000 dollars for football, basketball and sporting events. Plus 40 on parking, 200 on beer for 2-3 hrs for the total event. Disney is all day literally 10-12 hrs. And they set the atmosphere for great family time, if you think it’s just about the rides your lost🤦🏽‍♂️  plus the younger your kid is the more magical it is!!! ( as long as they are also old enough to comprehend what’s happening and going on while there)  Also if you have a teen and take them to Disney you will learn something about them you never knew before you went trust me on this. The place makes you talk🤷🏽‍♂️

Ridiculous greed, while the CEO and members of the board make millions annually. They can stuff this dump up their greedy backsides!🫡
Keep making the 1% richer by buying insane pricing.
Disney is so creepy too. I really don't want to give them any more money ever.
I was there a few weeks ago and yeh he’s right it’s too expensive. Plus full of people who don’t need to be in disability cars in them and prams with kids that are like 9 or 10 years old being pushed around I don’t know why. 😅
worth it!
Walt would be pissed! Approximately 60,000 people visited the park on Disneyland's opening day, July 17, 1955, when park admission was priced at $1 for adults and 50¢ for children. This did not include access to rides and other individual attractions; attraction tickets could be purchased separately for 10¢ to 35¢.
Pinch pennies... bit stupid going if you ask me
Imagine the prices after The donald tariffs 😅😂😬
Disney Land ought to be free to everyone. The Government should spend less on military equipment and more on entertainment.  Stop sending probes to Mars and stop funding other countries war machine.
And in Phantasialand, Germany, where Michael Jackson drove roller coasters just cost me 28€🤣😂😂🤣😂
Why support a business like Disney?   They care less about you or their employees.
a grand is budget kinda for a family trip to disney. it's a choice if you can afford it then go.
I am here in pigeon forge tn now ans even after the $82 per adult (that’s at $10 off per ticket) parking is still $25. Season passes help if you’ll be there enough but still 25 bucks is crazy for a park you’ve spent almost $100 on for a day
Did she say that groceries are getting a little bit better?  Where?
How is it still so crowded then??
Should this story be on CNN?
Disney gonna put themselves out of bysiness ..so sad..😮
Go fishing
I mean I live in a 3rd world country and I dont find that expensive. Maybe if youre planning to go every so often, but if its just once a year I dont get the over reaction to the price.
as a resident of socal I paid only $80 bucks California residents pass.
Yeah Disney is not worth it, maybe once or twice but deciding to go on vacation to Disney just because nah… there are better options.
GO TO FREE PARKS THAT TAXES PAID FOR
As long as you swipe your credit card it doesn't really hurt.
Bro this is disgusting Disney do better
Husband speaking - age 82.  My first trip to Disney Land in Calif. was 1965. age 22, single. Next time was 1972 , age 29, single.  Next  time was 1977, married, age 34.  Next was 1992, our son was age 7.  Prices were still ok, lines still long.  I would never go back now.
I’m from New Zealand and with the current exchange rate it would cost me $1652 NZD ($974 USD) just for the tickets… yeah fk that!
but its gotten better under this administration... 😅😅😂😂
Daddy is transistioning
And i bet most of the time it was just walking around.....or eating overly priced junk.  Edit: the same light sabre TEMU a couple of quid.
Dont go there. Its easy
She can spend time with her family at home….  for free!!  Pro tip #1
Almost 2k to go to Disneyland 😂😂😂😂😂
I can’t take this guy serious anymore with the mini ears.
Why???? Why pay that much for it? Just don’t.
I bet it cost..in 2002 i went to Disney..it was expensive then..not worth it 💵 at all in my opinion
That is totally ridiculous. From Australia 🇦🇺
MORON ALERT. BOYCOTT DISNEYLAND. ANYTHING DISNEY, AND THAT GOES FOR CALIFORNIA TOO. I WOULDN'T GIVE THEM 5 CENTS.
The greed of Disney is beyond stupid. And, it just tops of their shitshow costs for the lamest D+ crap! Disney has lost touch with families.
It was ALL cheaper before with Biden no matter what the Fox idiots say.
They’re not getting any of my money! I’m going hiking instead! 😊
Well duuuuuuuh
Some of the best days out are when it hardly costs  anything, take a kite to a beach with a picnic and your kids will have a lovely day. It's easy to fall into the National Lampoon family vacation trap, but is it really worth it?
This is not what Walt Disney envisioned for children—unaffordable
Don’t go, it is a fake experience
It has gotten better under Trump administration!!! Are you nuts!!! Clearly you don't live in reality
less kids; less expensive. the parking was cheaper than the last amusement park I went to in northern Virginia. the food bill and tickets will be drastically reduced if you only have 1 or 2 kids max. 5 kids is going to be expensive anywhere in the world.
Disney keeps making BS like she-hulk and snow tan. if you really want to hurt Disney, boycott Disneyland
Still blame the last admin!!!!! So ridiculous, lady!!!! It's because of TRUMP, Stupid!!!!
During Biden administration, I was able to afford a lot more.  Under Trump administration, I see my money slipping away so easily.  Everything costs a lot more
It had not gotten ANY better since trump!!!!!!! And it's not because of the last administration! This network is lying!!!
recently lef in shock too by staggering cost of eating seafood at high end mall in south jakarta especially the vat
Americans and Disney. Is it some form of a drug? because that`s just stupidity.
the poor Mini ears dad, $ 1400 can feed 1400 people in a refugee's camp.
I am not a Biden fan, but I am sick and tired of hearing "...the last administration...blah, blah, blah...". For heaven's sake, get a life!
Those parks are a big rip off.
No way ! Greedy Disney makes it out of reach for normal middle class families.
I've been to DisneyWorld a few times and no waaaaaaay I paid that much. However, I have a smaller family but still it was less than half of what he paid. I did pay extra to get a tour guide for the Magic Kingdom Park to get my family and guest to the head of the lines and discount food. It still was less than he paid. Inflation is crazy. I do not recommend Disney. It's not good. My son is an adult now and he's not that into amusement parks anymore and I don't ride anymore so we are good. lol!
If you're willing to pay those prices, you can't complain, you're contributing. You are part of the problem. Spend $1400 to enjoy her time with family in the waiting line? YOu could do that for cheaper by camping.
at least he can afford that, i can't afford to take my daughter to disneyworld.he spent more in one day at disneyworld than i make in a month.
If a business owner is complaining imagine how much it costs regular hourly wages employees BTW is this host high on crack? How are things better now? It’s worse than EVER !
Where is the story here? Just go on the website and you can see the prices. Disney has been overpriced for years
Totally not worth it!
Middle class is toast
Ripoffs
N.O.P.E.
I don’t see the appeal to Disney world. My parents offered to take me and the siblings there when I was younger and we all declined. It sounded boring.
Wake up people its crazy expensive smh
Then you tried to blame high prices on the Biden Administration. This ain't just a Biden Administration issue it's every Administration. Americans are not stupid just our government.
I hate paying $1,000 just to wait in line for hours
That’s light  Any trip is expensive
Disney definitely not worth it. A park is free of 99% cheaper
I think the magic is how quickly they can take your money and we are still there paying it. I will never in my life say “hey let’s go to Disneyland” on a trip. I’d rather go to the Forrest or the sand dunes or the beach. Anywhere but Disneyland.
They lost out on more money because of being woke...lost out on money and now raising their prices again.
Why going in the first place?
3:20 my parents hated each other so much that they never relized that i liked the 1% of time that we all spent together out of the house...just being together.
isn't he a car dealer? his channel grew during covid
So don’t go, problem solved
The locals can't afford to go to Disney wold !!!!   Disney sucks !
And yet they complain about not being able to pay their rent,bills, food, and ECT 😂😂
Never gone back to Disney ..that was 12 yrs ago.
Last time I went to Disney was 1990. I was a kid. Now I have two kids and I don’t have the money to go with them.
@debbie9929 , museums, hiking,outings with your children in national parks, picnics beaches these are just some of the inexpensive things you can do with your kids or yourself. You say things are so expensive find things that aren't
Walt Disney would be ashamed of what they’ve turned Disney World and Disneyland into.
Bye bye Disney , bye bye Las Vegas.
The only thing I noticed at Walt Disney World was the fact that it was all shopping. I did not see any real actual attractions.gosh and he still had to pay for each ride!!!??? Don't go there!
Good old Walt Disney would be turning in his grave if he knew what his incredible dream had become.
Not worth it just to stand in line for hours
Sorry, but surely the family could have researched the prices online beforehand? I think it's pretty stupid to go anyway and then complain about the prices afterwards.
Elon Musk just entered the chat 😂
Gotta go in Japan a lot cheaper
It’s a choice. Don’t go stupid. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Knowing what I know about disney bathrooms connected to tunnels, I will Never give disney a dime - save the children 🙏🏻😇🫶🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔
Recent trip, outrageous and the lines were ridiculously long. Don’t see us ever going back.
We used to go to the theme parks as a child and we had a cooler with food and drinks because if you buy food at the theme parks they little rake you over the coals in costs
Where was he thinking he was going ??? To the regular local park ???
Disneyland sells 'Happiness' with a price, and only richer people who can afford it comfortably, will have 'Happiness for a day'. - That is; if you can afford ($$$) it~ this is the Fact of our world we're living in.
Well there goes my dream of flying from Australia to  do Disney  for one  day.😅😅😅
This is what you voted for!
They should have put that money in their children's education funds
They probably are looking to fleece tourists. But now tourism is shot in usa, anericans will have to keep it afloat
Pedophilandia.
Buy them each a toy f that get each one of them a  fkng job what a simp
Ridiculous woke Disney SUCKS!!
You can afford it, Stop whining about it, you know the cost
I'm telling ya! This inflation we're seeing under Trump is worse than ANYTHING we saw under Biden.
ill give you $50 for a ticket lol
Never will I go to Disneyland or Disney World. This is EXTREME GREED! I won’t watch their movies anymore.
It's gotten better? Only on fox news?
Not worth going there.
Basically, he wanted to go viral so he posted a video about the cost despite knowing about the cost ahead of time!
breakin news BFD BFD BFD
How is average family not being able to afford Disney,  News in 2025? Life must be good here in the Trump administration
Disneyland sucks tooooo woke thanks leftwing liberal democrats.
No discount to Florida residents?   We go to six flags in NJ and the season pass is perfect, Last  time I took my daughter to Disney was in 2016 and it was expensive.
this kind of story is stupid; you CHOOSE to go there LMAO!!!!!!
Daddy looks like DeSantis🤣🤣🤣
Just shut down Disney all together.....corporate greedy jerks.......find something else to do....what a rip off......SMFH
Parks so big its almost impossible to explore them all fact lots of walking too
How are people still able to go ? Clearly, it is a debt trap. The saddest part 😢 is that a lot of children can't afford to go, and it's a place for children to live their fantasy
I jus went in July of 24 i spent 7 almost 8k in 7 days i don't wanna hear it 😂😂
"Small business owner"
I think Uni Studios and Disney Land just for little kid but so many adult come here alone, in couple in Japan, they flocking the train and I don't like them every morning
Disneys magic is your money! 😂🤣😂
I just paid $1700 on car 🚗 repairs.
Nooo, the price of things haven’t gotten better. Stop lying
It's all fake. Spend your money on something real.
lol. Idiots.
I live about an hour from the WDW gates and haven’t been there in 30 years. It was a 💩 hole then and now it’s a woke 💩 hole. No thanks. The place totally changed and sucks. Who would wait in line for two hours, in the hot sun, for a bs, horrible ride? 😑
Santa workshop in Colorado Springs is very fun and affordable
I live in Fl. This place is NOT worth what people are paying. Go to FUNSPOT!!!!
You have 2 pre purchase tickets so he knew.  Load of garbage
Bidenomics is rasing it's ugly head. America is an old, used worn out women of the night.  Get out while you can.

Yet thry continue to go there. Disney is greedy..end of story!!
Doesn’t make sense. Waiting in line up, means they are admitting to many people to enter the park
Last time was 1985 for the 50th. THE END.
You are there and can't even get a ride without a high extra fee, results of sorcery focus, evil D has become!!
I think they’re making up for the lost money on their woke movie failures
Can’t blame Grandpa Biden for that.. It’s ALL Trump now baby… Thx maga 🙄
The last time I went to Disney World in Florida was in the spring of 1976 and my entry ticket cost about 6 bucks.  You read that right. $6.
I will make a line business. You get to stand and get to know your family alot more. Only $500.
Can't afford Disney in this administration either... what is she talking about?
$1400 is pennies, get your money up. Or don’t go out doing rich people stuff
Took my kids last April spent around 7 grand in a week
I love how she said things were expensive under the last administration but now things are getting better.
Disney springs isn’t the same as Disney park. It’s specifically for restaurants. Could’ve went anywhere else
only the rich can go to Disney.... they'll have to start kidnapping and trafficking their own kids.....
Disney is a terrible ripoff!
Always blaming Biden.. it's worse now with Trump
They have to make up for all those movie failures somehow.
For comparison, here's an estimate of what the ticket costs would've been for his family in the past:  Year	Adult       Child      Total 1971	$3.50	$1.00	$12.50 1980	$8.00	$7.00	$37.00 1990	$31.00	$25.00	$143.00 2000	$46.00	$37.00	$212.00 2010	$82.00	$74.00	$394.00
That dad is an idiot.
Oh my. Insanity.
Fox is delusional everything was better under Biden
Nah to promote left wing lunacy
Yes, thanks for this video.  My Cleaning lady also told me how expensive Disney World was, especially if you have a family.  She said it would be almost 1000 dollars for her family just to do Disney world - what a money grab Disney World does.  To me, that is a RIP OFF and I would never go there. Disgusting
"We do all this stories on people who can't afford groceries or gasoline, or at least that was under the last administration. It's gotten a little bit better" 😂... WHERE IS IT BETTER!?
Boycott this price gouging and wake up! Corporate greed is plain as day! Wanted to take my children next year now VERY hesitant 😢
Hes a YouTuber so he could afford
Ok there are ways to save for Disney. There are a bunch of videos about it.i It's all strategy. You need to make a plan. By the way Busch gardens and sea world way cheaper.
STOP GOING STOP PAYING THEY WILL STOP CHARGING IT’S JUST THAT SIMPLE 😂
Knotts berry farm is wayyyy better and cheaper!
My 1500 mortgage ain’t lookin so bad now. Cheers
So maybe have more connection time and skip Disney??
They  advertising in UK at the moment just started again after years of not a single advert 😂😂 couldn't pay me to go to USA 😂😂
Did she really say the prices are getting better!??? Seriously? What a joke!
I love the mini mouse ears. 😂 Dad is a good sport. These big parks have it down to a science that they come out the winners all the time. BOYCOTT!!!
No wonder Disney just reported a great quarter and the stock price went higher up.  That’s because people keep buying their crazy expensive products which I refuse to be a part of.  Will not visit any of their theme parks nor streaming their channels.
Maybe Cruise ship.a better choice
People are stupid enough to pay it. They’re gonna keep charging it if no one pays that much they have to lower the price same with rent.
If you broke just say so bro.
I went to Disney in Japan last month, and it was cheap in US dollars and relatively cheap in my country currency (I'm Brazilian). I went to Disney Tokyo and DisneySea for one day each and with transport, food, tickets (including some fast passes) and some souvenirs, I must have spent around 300/350 dollars at max (about 1.150 brazilian reals). It was a very nice experience.
The other shocking (and abhorrent) thing about the Disney parks is how little they pay their workers.  It used to be minimum wage.  I googled this and starting in late 2023 it’s $17/18 an hour.  This is why there are families living in motels close to the Disney theme parks.  It actually makes me sick thinking about it.
My daughter is going to Florida in June to see her boyfriend. I told her she should go to Universal, since she has never been. I looked at tickets...they said it is not good to go without the express pass especially if you are only going for one day. The ride waits will be over an hour each or more in the nee lands. So the tickets were $230/each, $270/each unlimited express pass or $240 for not unlimited. So for the two of them just to walk into the park is $1,000. Nothing else included....no parking, food or souvenirs....etc. Needless to say, I doubt they will go.
Cross county road trip trumps all vacations when your on a budget..
Now, this is not an accusation, but a personal opinion, Disney probably is trying to recover some of the money they lost with snow white
It’s gotten better??? oh right yes this is Fox News 💩
But then it’s packed people spending.   But families need a family vacation.   Even if it is for one day.
Basically $250 each for a day at Disney including you getting something to eat...which in reality considering how much is there, how is that way too over priced???....- ❤️-
I think we need another Woodstock 99 with this place
We have people traveling from around the world to come to Disney to great memories, and they leave happy. Memories don’t have price. I really don’t see the meaning of the video.
Clown's will pay 🤡 prices....
Geez! Just the fast past alone is about as much as a PS5
$44 for a $5 toy 😮
bring your own food like GTG get Philippines lol
Why is this a surprise???? We’re Florida resident and there’s 2 of us no kids I would not spend money on this crap. Maybe a cruise next time Dad..
Seems like a total nightmare.All those people and I have to pay so much to be there.  HARD PASS
Me and the wife went few years ago for anniversary was 400$ for the 2 of us since Canadian $$ just for 1 park, went to harrypotter world Universal was also 435$ for the 2 of us but the hole place atleaat, flights were 400$ there and back, Airbnb at a hotel was 450$ for the week, ether way absolutely insane prices
Day passes are $$$
People have to take out a HELOC to spend one day with the family at Disneyland.  And Disney pay it’s employees Mickey dollars.
I can't imagine wasting that much money on something so worthless.
Yeah the cost of a Disney vacation is out of control. Its a somewhat magical experience but to pay all that money to wait in line all day to ride a couple rides is brutal. Not to mention the Disney resorts are also highly overpriced. How do you charge $500 to $1000 for what are basically standard hotel rooms with some somewhat subtle Disney inspired decorations...How does the average American family afford these prices...
LMBO 😂😂
Most will have opinions and or comments, but to me, Disneyland has become a corporate  amusement park, instead of a good ole family amusement park that anyone could take their family and have a fun time without going broke.
Who cares? I spent more than that in December of 24’ at Disneyland knowing Christmas was a couple days away.. get over it, the kids are having a blast
I just got back from a theme park across state line from me. $30 for parking, paid $40 in advance for my online ticket (along with a $5 “protection fee” if I had to cancel due to weather or other unforeseen circumstances). And that’s all they got out of me. I packed my own lunch in a cooler and ate while tailgating in my car, didn’t buy any of those overpriced souvenirs, and certainly didn’t eat nor drink anything in the park.
It’s nuts how much Disney costs. I don’t know how families afford it with several kids. Lines are too long. It’s not as fun as it used to be to be because of the cost. We always got passes every year but no more. Disney needs to change costs and making reservations.
NEVER!
and to think my friends and I had a blast sticking a kiddie pool at the bottom of someone's backyard swing set slide and a garden hose at the top, a package of cold hotdogs, cold kool aid and a warm summer day
its not family friendly if you spend as much as I make in 2 weeks
That is why I love holiday world in southern Indiana. Clean, affordable free soft drinks. Water park and several themed parks inside. Friendly staff as well.
Gotta make up for the loss of that recent film Disney released. 😅😅
Your kids don't need a trip to disney to have a good happy childhood
I fee lbad for you, disney is the evil empire of ripping every family off in the US
NOTHING is better, what planet is this lady living in?! EVERYTHING is MORE expensive! Just becasue you say something, it doesn't make it true. I live in Miami, can't speak for other cities, but everything here keeps going up.
OMG
They were residents of Florida…Now double and triple that price for people who aren’t Florida residents..add Flights..hotels etc…Forget about it…Dude said all he was doing was “Swiping” 😂😂😂
Why would any sane person spend that kind of money at that loony liberal place???
Why are Americans stingy, what's $1400 for a day of fun, come on, a country with the biggest economy in the world.
“Most families can’t afford to do Disney”…Meanwhile they said the lines were long and park was packed…..smdh 😒
Scam
Uhh he’s not the only person who paid that, so why is this even news worthy 🤔
Go to the Ark Encounter, The Creation Museum in northern Kentucky/Cincinnati, Ohio area and the Museum of the Bible in Washington, DC.
Dad you have a smart girl there
I love that he is wearing the minnie mouse
If you can't afford Disney go to Micheal Jackson's never land...
I wouldn't pay it
Beta male with wearing the ears even after spending $1,300 for that Disney crap. Smh....
they're nothing but scammers.
Switch to national parks and start boycotting Disneyland. Your children will thank you for it later
Boohoo
It's because of Obama changing laws to allow foreign investors to buy up everything and price us out. It's all entertainment nationwide.
I have no sympathy for this guy.    He should have done his research and he would have figured it out real quick.
That guy is not the sharpest knife in the drawer tossing out $1400 for a day at a amusement park just so he can make the shareholders wealthy. He did not need to drop $1400 just to impress the kid. Stop living beyond your means. Debt is slavery.
Not like anyone forced him to go to Disney World.
It is really expensive .My kids cried for waiting 2-2.5 hours for rides at Magic Kingdom .And yes if you split money for what rides you can ride ,it is totally crazy😢.
Disney isn't worth it 😡!
They can watch TV
Ppl it’s a simple fix stop overpaying for mediocre crowed places sometimes you just got to tell Disney and all these greedy corporations NOOOOOOOOOO
After all the scandals, do you feel moral to go there with kids and push them more of your money !!??
Why would you take your kid to a company that pushes homo agendas and has had so many pedos working at there parks. You can't fix dumb.
Woke Disney would have to pay me to go there
Why, oh why does anyone even BOTHER to go to WDW anymore? The Universal parks are much more fun and have many more cool rides. The Disney parks have really gone downhill in the last 10 years, and everything at WDW is horrendously expensive.  The son said that waiting in line and talking with his family was the most fun? You could have done that at HOME and saved the $1400 to go do something else a LOT better than going to WDW!
Yeah these tariffs are affecting everything!!! Thanks war dodger Donald .
If Disney is expensive....dont go to Disney
The little girl just said Waiting in the lines was the best part!?!?!?!? 💀💀💀💀☠️☠️☠️
In eastern Europe it is a monthly net salary of a well educated adult. Please stop sponsoring such parks and concerts are the next overpriced good. When you sponsor, corporations drive prices up worldwide. Then they do not know what to do with money so huge funds buy out our appartments and land. Please be responsible when you give money to corporations.
Boycott Disney!! They advocate for murdering kids!
Disney will never be the same as long as ABC is involved..I will never go back..All WOKE!!
1400 and all your daughter wanted was to talk with her family🤣🤣🤣
Maybe someone should have introduced him to the internet so he could have done some advance research. There is no reason he should have been that clueless
Turnip should do something about this🤣
Hello people
And you wonder why personal debt levels keep rising smh
Charging 30$ for parking is crazy
Disney is satanic
We need more testimonies like this herewith (THANK YOU!!), to help us be aware of HOW we ALL are being taken to the CLEANERS by these GREEDY corporations day in and day out !
So sad a lot of family 's can't  afford to take ther families . Last time ive been ther wen my son was 7rys old he's  23 now!!
Why is he on the news for this.. do your research before you go places lol
LEFTIST DISNEY is making guests compensate them for their MANY FAILED WOKE MOVIE BLUNDERS. Disney has destroyed Star Wars, Marvel, Indiana Jones, and Disney+
1400 dollars for one day man please you can go to a water park for few hours and then eat at a buffet for less. But like he said that it wasn't a planned trip. Places like Disney you have plan and save early before going but at least the kids had 😊😊
The little mouse has become a real BIG rat !
2:19 Where has  inflation got better?? At least my 401K was doing well during the last administration….. Your sucking up to this administration is beyond comprehension! You have no shame. How can you live with yourself??
Nope, gone there, done that in 2009.  Spent two hours waiting in line for a 2-5 minute ride. Came back with a leg infection from all that waiting and walking. Next time I told the kids that when we go back, take me in a wheelchair! Luckily they are all grown now and refuse to travel anywhere with me.
Approximately $200 a ticket & $30 parking sounds reasonable. But rides, drinks, & souvenir’s overpriced
Never been, never cared
I disagree with this reporter - It hasn't gotten better under this administration so that's grossly inaccurate!!!!  Things are getting worse whether we're buying eggs or  disney tickets!
It cost me $800 for me and my family to get in. That doesn't count food, drink, souvenirs, etc. Disney is in debt, and they are making families pay for it!!!!
The Disney Cruise is HIGHWAY ROBBERY...
1. The place is for children 2. The place is a business 3. The place is a business in America. Welcome to 2025 😂😂😂🦅
Thank you God I’m not married
Stop wimping and whining.  If you cannot afford the trip, then do not go.  It is just that simple
You should’ve went to Busch Gardens
😂 Not Disney's fault 🤷‍♀️
The greet of multinationals is unlimited, recreation parks ,the addictive junk foods ,games etc etc. They want your money and your health and well-being is side walk. Most rules and regulations are for protecting themselves not for you 🤮
Get Trump to fix this! Time to slap tariffs on Theme parks.
Take your kids to see something real
Why is it necessary to go ? 😂😂
Crazy I’m here this week and prices are crazy 🤣
Us 6 kids were so happy just to go to Cedar Point every Labor day weekend! In Sandusky Ohio
😂
FOX NEWS SUCKS
Spending all of Daddy's money was the most fun...  "Was what she wanted to say"😂
People keep paying these crazy prices and there's still an hour wait for each ride. It's supply and demand at its best. They have to set the prices higher to help thin out how many people want to attend to control the experience.
@2:25 ."...It's gotten a little bit better..."🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙄🙄
Go the hell, Disney !
Cry me a river…
😳 Crazy!!!!
That is crazy!
Disney is such a waste of money, I’m shocked anyone goes there anymore. Old adage remains true… A fool and his money are soon parted.
Disney is woke and overpriced. Never went and never will
You would have a better vacation on a cruise. Way more for the money
Its gotten a little better lady...where do you live?
MAKE DISNEY AFFORDABLE AGAIN lmao 😂🍊🤡
Disney is a scam!!
You failed to mention how safe you felt for you and your family.
What’s the appeal of this place ?? Mickey ?? 😂😂
Its not for everyone!
I haven’t been in a while. I got day passes for $8. Last time, I went to Epcot. Only made it  to three countries and tried to eat my way through. Don’t know what the admission was. If your kids want to go, let that teen job earnings pay for it. Unless money is not a concern.
Overhyped crap! Don’t go!
I guess my family will not be able to visit Disney unless we win the lottery
Nothing new as we already know that shits are skyrocketed in price it is absurd yet wages are the same. Homelessness will be tremendously increased if the inflation doesn't settle.
Disney is expensive and the higher prices keep the riff raff out. Less fights and nut jobs. I wish they did that on airlines also.
Its called a captivated audience.  Youre trapped in a park all day. They have nobody to compete with.
Fun vs GREED 💰
Disney has always been expensive across multiple presidential administrations. This isn’t new or news.
First world problem.
It hasn’t been worth it for years now, not sure why people are still going. I’ll never go bk, Disney should be shut down.
Nice daughter  Good job parents !
Disney  WWE shows Rock Concerts  All too expensive!  We ALL need to stop going!!! Let them beg us to go by REASONABLE prices OR go out of business!!!
Disney is so overrated😅😅
Went from the happiest to the most expensive place. Corporate greed at its finest.
Stop lying woman and talk the truth omg. Things gotten a little bit better with eggs at $8.00 per dozen 🤣🤣🤣👌. Good one news liar 😳😳🤣🤣
It cost us for 2 rooms, 6 nights, 5 day non-park hopper in January $6000.00 for 5 adults, one 11yrs old & one infant. I will never go back it was terrible.
Eh. That’s a drop in the bucket. His kids will always remember that experience.
😮😮😮😮😮😮💴💴💴💴💴💴
No one pushing you to go there & spend your hard earned money. You can choose to go somewhere else. if you go Disney in even regular off season you will see people all over & wait time up to 90 mins on some popular ride. American have money when it comes to vacation or fun. Disney is the proof whether you like it or NOT. we even borrow from credit card company to have FUN then struggle to pay back. We American should make our priorities right before blame corporate giant’s.
Didn't he sell cars.
F THAT
Great news for that hustler DeSantis!
Should have bought her clothes, sunglasses and shoes instead of all that.
I will never go
5 people...
Maybe dont have 5 kids lol
The cost of Disney has gotten absolutely exorbitant.  The reason they keep raising prices is people keep going.  To me this is not a relaxing vacation.  Id rather go to a nice beach, and spend a week there
Disney has been overpriced for years and it is stupid for Disney to do this to families,lower the dam price on the most expensive place on earth,sorry,sorry “The happiest place on earth “
Why is this on the news?
Take em to Chuck E. Cheese they won’t know the difference 🤣
Someone told me Dollywood is a fraction of the cost of Disney and ten times more affordable and fantastic!
Staying far away from Disney and there hidden agendas...
You're better off taking your kids on a nature hike, they would gain more from that.
The happiest place on earth? For those who can afford it. Terrible!
This news story is ridiculous.  Like anything else "Dad",  do your research BEFORE you go in order to determine affordability.  If people want to complain about Disney, that's fine.  There will ALWAYS be two sides to the Disney love/hate relationship.  Disney is a FOR PROFIT BUSINESS that must answer to Shareholders.  They continue to update, refurbish and build new attractions.  It does cost money.  It is expensive.  However, like everything else, prices continue to increase but the paycheck has  not and wages will never increase at the rate material goods, services and entertainment do.  I don't agree with taking away the free perks that Disney used to have while at the parks/resorts/MCO (prior to Pandemic) but it won't stop me from going.  I research. Do my homework and go with a Plan.  It's where I choose to vacation and do so with excitement.  Others choose to spend their money elsewhere and do what makes them happy.  Perhaps to a sporting or theater event that costs...how much????? That's ok as many have said, there are plenty of other ways and places people can find happiness while vacationing.
I’m so glad I wouldn’t go even if everything was free. That’s how bad I think Disney is!!!
I lived in orlando in the 80,s. We could show an id, get the resident discount and pay $16 a day.  Or look at the cashier, say HEY! dont you go to Conway? And get in for free with a handfull of  vouchers too.   😁 And then I too worked there...I saw the fireworks display like 100 times. Was one of the more epic parts of living in Orlando area.  But If he was really a local then he would know you can go to a restaurant 2 blocks off the main and pay HALF! And if you eat at Disney Meh. Its Disney, y'know simulated...We got yelled at for putting too much purple cabbage in to the salads. Not because it wasnt good, because the minuscule amount more was deemed "Uneeded". and someone got written up lol. Yet its all made by weight.  LOL.  But yeah I never saw any of the Gory "issues" and "charecter malfunctions" while there. Like the girl who walked into the shrinking access point space you were supposed to stay out of when the machines run. And the scalpings on the magic mountain...we all heard stories though!  1980s that is. Ive also swum in the lake and around treasure isle at night. We didnt care. How dumb now.
Its all Satanic with predictive programming in all their movies, ran by the Luciferian Cabal. No thanks
The question we should be asking is if employees are getting paid more?  how much does it help sustain the local economy?  Also stock holders are investors, many expect a return on profit for the risk they take on investing in this company. These investors are individuals, retirement accounts managed by large institutions etc.
Aside from price. You wait in line for 2 hours just for a 20 minute ride.   They need to limit the number of visitors per day   Also. I went in 2019.  People with flu coughing all over  Close together for hours.   That’s how illness spreads.  Not the lockdown nonsense needed
The daughter just wanted time with her Family… how beautiful.
Pinching pennies at Disney? Yeah, okay.
Maybe he should spend his money on an internet connection; No way in hell he just found out in 2025 how much it costs to go to DW if he had one.
I wouldn't go to a Disney Park if it was free.
At 2:21 did she say groceries have " gotten a little bit better" ?
We stopped going to Disney many years ago because of their expensive prices! Never going there again, for the money it costs to go there on a two day trip, we can go on a cruise for 7 days. That cruise includes the food, the room and amazing ocean views.
As the old saying goes..."a fool and their money are soon parted" and "you can't fix stupid". Then to complain about it AFTERWARDS. You should of looked before you leaped.
In today's economy that might be underwhelming.
🚫  Life is good - without disney.
Did the kids have fun yes or no?
Insane
It gotten a bit better? The economy especially small businesses are going to tank due to the trade wars.
Americans are being fi$ted to enjoy entertainment- sports, cruises, movies, trips, kids amusement parks.
I laugh how she saulys the last administration but its ok for trump to raise the tariffs making all the prices go up
Going to places is so stupid now you have to pay so much for a day in the park
If you decide to make this expense it's 100% on YOU!!
Yeah it's expensive but you chose to go and spending time with your family......priceless
They keep charging more money and the quality keeps going down. Take a minute to actually look at what the ticket prices are and then look at how many attractions are actually in each park. For example, Hollywood Studios only has seven rides and that’s when they are all working
Why is he shocked? Gotta pay for DEI somehow. I like the suggestion of take them to national parks, museums and history educating exhibits and activities. Teach them about what an honor it means to be American despite the BS that the left is pushing like DEI, Trans and immigration. Teach them about the heroes that died in WW1,2 ,and the sacrifice that soldiers make everyday.
Disney is a scam .To F …expensive.
Let’s see if we can get grocery prices to go viral get them down. I don’t have to go to Disney. I do need food 😢
That's ridiculous.
To see what?! I went to Eurodisney and saw nothing special! I liked the Moon ride and that was it.
Yeah we'll just watch Disney + and call it good. Maybe not even that idk. I need my $10 a month.
If you go to Disney go with a open mind that it is going to be expensive
Yall need to do more research before yall go throwing cards at stuff. Granted I ain’t paying for 5 people, actually just 2, I spend maybe 1500 from the time I leave home till the time I’m back on a 5 day trip to Disney world. Research what stuff you can cut out completely and what stuff will actually add quality to the trip. Don’t just go swiping the card once you there and complain!!!
Even though I live in Florida I haven't been back to Disney since just before Covid because unfortunately for many their pricing make it no longer the Happiest Place on Earth.
That's because corporate and non Americans run the US.
I go 2 times a year
I remember going in 1998 tickets were like 30 dollars
His mistake was going there
Ugh!! How embarrassing 🙈 standing next to dad who made the news for complaining about the price of everything
I wanted to take my son for high school graduation but I gave him cash and stayed home instead because I have muscular dystrophy and can't do rides but it costs the same admission. No way am I going to pay that much but can't do anything.
💔
Bob Iger, Disney’s CEO, raked in $41.1m last year, a 30% increase over his 2023 salary of $31.6m. His current net worth is over $700m. THAT is what your $30 parking and $30 ice cream cones are paying for! Imagine complaining about Disney’s prices while voluntary handing over your hard-earned money to a guy worth $700 MILLION DOLLARS! 😂
Fox is the worst smh, can’t even have a normal conversation without bringing up politics.
Absolutely ridiculous. 🤬
Disney is trash.
Stop going!!! It’s absurd
Don't go
That’s crazy but in my family we budget and tell the kids we can eat outside the park as well as we eat where i told you
Even though the parks are expensive, they’re overcrowded. If they were cheaper, there would be even more people.
My wife and I are Florida residents. We pay $700 each a year for the Pirate pass. In total we pay $1,400 at Disney a year. Parking is free and we bring our lunch or eat there. It doesn’t have to be that expensive. He just doesn’t know how to actually plan a Disney trip. After our sixth trip, the rest are already paid for a technically “free”. Disney isn’t cheap, but it doesn’t have to be this expensive.
overcrowded, expensive and crappy food.
Cedar point is better
Consider that if you have to wait hours in line for one ride given Disney’s current prices, the wait would only be longer if the prices were lower. Can you really blame Disney for charging high prices? Your complaints mean f-all. People vote with their wallets, and the vote is clearly that more people than the park capacity can handle are willing to pay ludicrous prices to eat mediocre food, acquire chintzy souvenirs, and wait in line for hours for each ride, all while navigating an overcrowded park. I went to DW with my family as kid 40 years ago, back when the experience was remotely worth it; nothing I hear about that experience today compels to me ever go back, though. To Disney, you’re a sardine with a credit card. If you don’t like it, then don’t go. 😮
Where the video
Go to Universal Studios
Go to Gatorland instead....cheap and fun as hell!
Better ways to spend 1400 dollars are you kidding that’s rent money
Lightning passes were still restrictive
Stop going to Disney
It has not gotten better, smfh!!
Not to family friendly.
Stop it. Don’t go?  Disney has always been expensive!  Everybody knows this!?
Kids really don’t care, it’s the parents who are in competition with their friends. Like the girl said she just likes spending time with her family. A trip to the county park would’ve been just as memorable.
I would say u came out on top for 5 people im trying to figure out what u talking about
$1400. I went to Disneyland in 1981. It was affordable then.
Daughter has THE solution.  Go on the "Disney Lineup" trip, without going to Disney!  Start a camp fire, make smores and just converse, saves a ton of money. May be just as memorable.. then buy that light saber.
I rather go on vacation somewhere else much more affordable.
Why so surprised??!!! 😅 must live under a rock not to know and expect it
Really, there are a lot of things I want to do that are expensive.  Don't go to Disney if you can't afford it.  If they lowered the price it would be so full you wouldn't have been able to go at all.
48,000 visitors x $400 (each person) = 19m. This is better than drug money, tell chapo.
Actually if you stay 2 nights at the value resort with a FL discount, you qualify for the dining plan.  You have free parking and shuttle every where to the park and other resorts!  Dining plan even includes 2 snacks which could be a churro or mickey ice cream.  It's less money that way!!
Things are going down?? Where? Prices are going up on everything!!!
Disney can suck it yhey had made a good movie in years !
Really how is this news. It's 2025 what did he expect to pay 300 dollars. Everything in the world is high now and im sure this wasn't his first vacation. Then obviously he could afford it because he was able to pay it. Then a white person complaining about money is weird to me.
Always went to Universal. Never gave a second of thought to Disney.
*Absolute Rip Off ! $$$$*
Prices so high the average person can’t afford to do anything these days. We can barely afford food and shelter
Easy fix, don't go.
Heck just take them to 6 flags
It's almost like the left told the right wind media that trumps tariffs would eventually lead to everyone paying more geeez
yes I was flabbergasted when I went last year with my mom and son. just admission was like close to 600, then the lightening pass was an extra fee. and those Disney ears for 3 people cost me like 150 dollars. I would do it again, but it has to be disposable money that I DONT need on anything else.
You can tell by her answer the he4 parents raised her well.😊
Disney is just trying to make up for the millions Mrs. Farquaad lost them with her deluluness.
Times are changing.
Stop going 💯
Did she say groceries have gotten better ??? STOP LYING TO Americans!! FOX WAS JUST SUED AND HAD TO PAY MILLIONS andFOX IS STILL TELLING LIES .TELL THE TRUTH . Disney world is a luxury NOT A NECESSITY.  I don’t know anyone that is doing better under trump. Even the millionaires and billionaires are feeling it 😂it’s a great day in America when the super rich are feeling the pain in their wallets also 😂😂😂😂😂 I honestly don’t care. I’m poor, live paycheck to paycheck , so oh well.
I’m over Disney… One year I spent $2400 on passes for my family. ONE YEAR. I spent $2600 on my Santa Cruz MTB. Endless fun, better than whatever roller coaster Disney could come up with.
Meanwhile Bob Iger, the CEO of Disney, has a net worth of nearly 1 billion dollars. Crooks.
For 1400 dollars you should just buy a used car and go on a road trip your family. You will have fun plus you get to keep an actual car 🚗.
Walt Disney never wanted this - he wanted it to be afforadable for all. Paying modern Disney just tells them you accept their price-gouging.
Its always been expensive. Not a surprise!  Must be a slow day
We traveled from Mexico for 3 persons and cost $4 000 all include Airplane, hotel , transportation from Airport to hotel and back and entrance 4 days
Should’ve went camping instead
This is on the dad. He knew what he was in for financially when he chose to go to a Disney park and went through with it. No valid reason to complain about it after the fact.
CrZy this lady reporter still took a jab at Biden administration when 100 days of orangehead been hell for folks out there .. this is about disney expensive scene and she still tried it 😂
The cost of maintaining Racism and WS continues to be highly costly
I remember back in the early 2000s Disney World charged my dad $25 for a basketball and now I think to myself that's highway robbery
My vehicle is falling apart and I can't afford to fix it
Yeah it's ignorantly expensive
Huh, you'd think that income has not kept up with the inflation of prices.  Try not being able to afford vacation for 3 years.
Hmm a fox story - be suspicious folks -  very, very suspicious!
I am florida's toughtiest swimmer🏊‍♂️
This is why I can't afford to take a vacation anymore every dollar I make it just goes towards survival no fun
Well, yeah a one day is very expensive and um not trying to defend Disney but like for example i went to Disney me, wife 2 kids and we picked the SoCal package, 3 days of disney 4 people worth $800 bucks, plus hotel it was around $1200 for 3 days of Disney. There are ways to save money so yeah
If you are a Florida residence why not be an annual pass holder
Uh no crap dude do some freaking research! This is normal
Why are you asking the kid if a Disney Trip is worth it?  The kid isn't paying for the trip.  That's a question for the father, for which I will answer on his behalf: "No, Disney World is definitely not worth the money spent."
Couldn’t have done research to find out the cost beforehand…of course not i’M a DuMb LaZy ‘MuRiCaN!
Go to Branson Missouri and take your kids to silver dollar city! Way better than Disney
People act like going to Disney is mandatory.   What’s wrong with the beach, trails, outdoor sports, camping, pool?   This culture of making it feel like you’re mandated to give your children everything is sick and quite weird.  Save for college so that they can prosper debt free
There shouldn't be any shock.  If you go to Disney World without doing your homework and having a basic budget, then that's a foolish move for any trip. With that said, Disney World is overpriced.
Well, work harder in your 9-to-5 job, buddy
"I can't afford this thing!!" yells man as he chooses to buy the thing that he doesnt need.
Wait at the end of the day … the kids just wanted more time talking and hanging out with the family wow … we new ideas of family time now … 😂😂❤
Honestly, even if we could afford Disney (which we could never), we wouldn't go. After all their woke crap they force. We canceled Disney back in 2022.
It’s a money trap luckily I’m born and raised  from Florida I’ve been to Disney way too many times to count the Florida  resident discount is crud and it’s really not all that. I’d much rather go to Busch gardens or universal.
Next Vegas!
I wouldn't pay to go to Wokeland.
STOP PAYING TO GO. I AM SERIOUS. AS A SOCIETY WHEN DO YOU PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN AND SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.   Also, people complain about how expensive medical is but don’t even think twice about how expensive one f’ing day in DISNEY is? You people are so dense.
Six flags is much cheaper and funner rides in my opinion.
gotta fund those BOMB 💣 movies somehow   😂
Don’t like it , don’t support it 😅
So many greedy people.       Disney supports slave sweat shops.
Suckers born everyday
the dad seems dumb for paying those crazy prices
Why would you pay $1000 to go for one day and then eat outside the park?
Yeah just dropped 3,000 for a Disney trip with my wife and kids in January it’s crazy
Oh the insanity!  Wake up people and boycott "The Woke Disney Corp."  Unless you have more money then brains!  Sad!
Florida man.  Waaaaaaaa   I can’t afford to take my family To Disney-world    Should’ve worked harder and smarter.
It’s totally not worth it, Disney cruises are same, waste of money
We don't go to Disneyland ANYMORE. The COSTS is ridiculous. Over rated!  It's not the "Happiest place on earth" for a family but definitely happiest biz for investors and owners. Florida has awesome beaches and i love the warm water to swim plus all the great places to eat with the family. If you're going to spend that much at Disneyland go to a Europe or Caribbean vacation.
Should’ve gone to EPIC universe instead     I don’t mind paying these prices I’m blessed to have a good job and give my kids memories.  I usually save 350 a check and save for a whole year and go during Halloween or Christmas. That’s why it’s not a hit   But if you buy the package and go the following month yes that breaks the bank 🫨
I'm not shocked at all, if people would just stop going there the prices would drop, common sense
Been there and No it wasn't.
People that cant afford disneyland dont matter to disney
They need those 67 billion in annual ticket profits
I went here when I was a teen with my parents and grandparents epcott center just opened boring asf 😂 I mean no long lines at all I just did not get it. I never cared for Disney character’s as a teen neither did my brother and sister. But I was glad to be with my parents and grandparents. Dad said we were going back the following year we said please no dad. We live in Georgia we always loved Six flags so we did six flags the following year. I’m sorry any and all Disney sucked then and I imagine now from this guys story!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
Between the corporations and government  it’s a double edged sword every year  we get less options
Disney recently made a movie about a teenaged girl who gets knocked up on a one-night stand with Satan. I'm not kidding- look it up.
This is not news.
Whinner.. I'll bet anyone who's ever heard of Disneyland knows it's hella expensive.  Do your homework first
Boycott ALL Disney.
Yeah they out of pocket we don't go for that reason and I work hard
I thought everyone knew that Disney for a family would be expensive. People are obsessed with Disney and will pay top dollar for regular food with Mickeys head on it. It’s weird that he’s surprised. Pinching Pennies at Disney is crazy talk 😂
The prices at Disney World are diabolical  🤷🏽‍♀️
you can't buy happiness as what they say  but with this it seems you can but there are other alternatives to make kids happy
Didn’t plan his trip very well
There is no way in hell I'd waste money on anything Disney related...camping, fishing and hunting, no crowds, no kitsch...and no giving money to people that hate me, my God, my country and my beliefs...F**k Disney...
While it’s good to point out the one day costs for a Florida resident, that’s not the best way to spend money at Disney as a Florida resident. He should have bought the Disney Discover Florida resident tickets for just $60 a day for 4 days. That’s way more worth it than the money he blew in just one day. If he goes often enough, he might as well splurge for a Florida resident specific annual pass to save substantial money in the long run.
2:15 no lady those are still problems under the current administration. All these news channels doesn’t matter where you go are so manipulative nowadays lol
I wait for the fairs.. and those are high.. but not nearly as high as Disney it’s craziness.
You were dumb enough to pay it so don’t complain
We’ve never been and don’t plan on it.
"Has gotten better since last administration"!? What!!!! It's worst now dummy!!!!!
WALY DISNET IS ROLLING IN HIS GRAVE GURANTEED THE PRICES ARE INSANE
I don’t know.  My parents didn’t take me to Disney.  You can’t always get what you want.  I would not have wanted them to spend the money if they were short.  They also didn’t believe in expensive cars.  It’s also no wonder a couple decades later they were a lot more affluent.
This is why I do amusement parks much cheaper and the roller coasters are fantastic or just enjoy nature
It costs a lot to be WOKE
I understand the price to get in the park. The staffing, rides, maintenance, fireworks, parades and so forth cost  $. They should not charge to park. When we go we make it a 2-3 day trip to save on cost. Budget your meals and pick the rides you want to do. We open and close the park.  Universal cost is similar and lines were longer.  I purchase Disney gift cards at Kroger- get the fuel points and save them.  Budget your money.  Might take 16-20 months but you can make it expensive or can bring your own food and snacks and make it work.
It's tax on the poor. They do this in so many ways. Overpriced food items at supermarkets, overpriced gadgets (tablets, phones, watches, laptops), overpriced entertainment (show tickets, amusement park tickets), overpriced food at restaurants... They charge you that much because they know you are weak. Your kids are being educated about values by the street, nowadays known as social media. Once they are brainwashed into consumerism, every time you as a parent don't 'deliver' what they expect you to, they will simply call you 'an embarrassment'. The only way to re-educate them, at that point, is to let them go. Let them hit the streets and come back crawling when they realize how difficult it is to make $300 (which is the per person average they are happy to spend in one day in Disneyland).
I’ve spent 5k in one day on Disney  wth is he bitching about lol and I do it once a year never mind what the whole week is I hate to look
You claim to be pinching pennies but you just spent $1000 on Disney tickets and another $250 in a restaurant. There are way way better places to get value for your money.  Basically, you are making bad choices due to societal expectations and then blaming someone else (big bad Disney) for the choices you made.  The real loser is you and your family.
I totally get it I it's not family friendly no more cost wise
Go camping instead
horrible
Why are people still supporting Disney???
My ex wife is going with my son. I don't know how, but shes going with her mom and my kid. Meanwhile divorced that gets to take care of what used to be my house. I hate life is not fair but whatever.
Obviously, the dad just needs to work harder to make more money. Right?  /s
Disney should offer an ultra exclusive VIP package that allows you to cut in line and push a middle class person waiting
cheap dude
Not funding  there wokeness
Why would a parent support that company that sexualizes children?😢
Dave Ramsey: Sell the kids 😂
Parking and hotel used to be free until you and ceo change that. America is all about money, America Money Culture!!!! Waltz Disney himself is not greedy. You guys should research deeper instead of whatever you research on
Time for camping trips and wildlife parks. Disney overrated
No one forced them to go.
I don't care for Disneyland and their ridiculous prices!
No more for middle class
You can go to an amusement park in your home state, spend less and still have fun. I went to Disneyworld but this was when I was a kid in the 90’s. Couldn’t even imagine going now. And notice how the daughter didn’t even seem that impressed and said the lines were crazy long and just enjoyed spending quality time with her family. That type of experience can be spent elsewhere.
The title made me think this was from The Onion. No, prices are NOT getting better, but it's Fox News, so don't expect the truth. Another lying, blonde bimbo for MAGA! As far as this-- don't have kids, or don't go to Disney-- or go and don't take the kids! LOL!
Back in the *90s,* it was *$24.00* for *admission!* Also, everything else back then wasn’t crazy expensive, but I’ve been there so much that it feels *redundant* now 🤷🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
I stopped going to Disney parks in 2023 my last trip to Disneyland made me realize how much money I wasted on tickets food merchandise and hotel
Disney is for the rich I’m a family of five couldn’t afford it
Disney in Calif is just as pricey
NOBODY SHOULD BE SHOCKED AND WHY IS THIS ON THE NEWS LOL IT'S BEEN LIKE THIS FOR AGES AND ONLY GETTING WORSE 😂😂😂😂 IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT DON'T GO😂😂
"It's gotten a bit better" since the last  administration? What? Prices are just as bad and will get worse when all the tariffs kick in.  Anyway, yes Disney, and most other forms of entertainment, have insane prices. Loved the little girls response that her favorite part was waiting in line because the family could talk. That shows that many kids would have a good time just about anywhere as long as the family is united and talking with each other.
ticket purchase... news is BS. he bought the tickets months ahead of time, and the news set this all up. WE ALL know its BS. the story is BS. there is nothing we can do about it. FK OFF
Their sure aren’t Family friendly
Disney stinks.. nothing special
It took me years to pay off a family trip to Disney World .
Someone has to pay for Disney's DEI initiatives.
That little girl just spit some facts I’ll never forget trying to entertain yourself as a kid in that cedar point line.
I will never take 2 of my kids to Disneyland no matter what even tho I got the spending money for it but their not going the only place I’m takin them is the Los Angeles zoo it’s much cheaper than going to Disneyland and Universal Studio HOLLYWOOD either that take them to Santa Monica pier and let them have fun and is cheaper too
Nothing good comes from florida
Her slick statement about the 'last' administration struggled with inflation as to imply this administration is not? FOX just can't help itself.
This is why I'm liking more to Universal
Lol this is news?
Boycott Disney Disney = child predators
Yep, America over Promises, Under delivers !!  Just like that 🍊🤡 President that represents all American citizens !! 🤥🤥🤥🤥🇳🇿
To charge parking it’s ridiculous and to think that they made that$ in less than a hour, come on! Disney doesn’t need to charge that huge amount, when they constantly gaining every single day….unnecessary; it’s supposed to be affordable for every kid.
The worse economy in years. Layoff everywhere.
Disney is an extremely overpriced racket with sweltering heat, 2 hour long lines, bonuses for those who pay extra, and barf all over.   Find a nice park somewhere for free.
I did Disney World with my Dad in 1974. He was an Engineer for Pepsi Cola, who had concessions there (Mile Long Bar and Country Bear Jamboree), so we got free admission and E Tickets for the rides. Space Mountain was under construction, but not opened yet. I think I’ve had my fill of Disney.
Just boycot disney
It should not cost a month's salary, for some, to go there. Sound like they need a Doge for their company.
Disney is for the Rich only.
it’s a very hot topic and it’s very expensive as well 😄
Love her answer, best part…standing in line talking with family. 😊
Her favorite part was waiting in lines with her family? Dad, you could have saved a lot of money by taking the whole family to the DMV. 🚙
Serves him right! Idiot
Insane in the membrane. Disney is an American corporation with stock. They have one goal. One goal. It started with Mr. Walt himself. He was a businessman.
I don't even understand the hype,my I had family members that used to work for Disney, they would give me free family member pass to visit Disney,,I never go🤷
NO ONE WANTS TO GO TO DISNEY                       SO MANY OTHER PLACES TO GO AND HAVE A BETTER TIME AND SPEND LESS $$$$$$
Disney is a rite-of-passage for parents. Took my family of four there 15 years ago and went back a few more times. Stayed at different hotels, from the Floridian to the low-end budgets. IMO, it's at least $1,000 a day for any kind of fun experience, cheaper and better if you book everything in advance. The higher the cost the fewer the crowds and nicer the experience, so ignore the cheap on-site closet-room hotels. Plan for at least a 3 or 4 day stint with a rest day or afternoons off. Without the fast pass and booking every character meal possible, it's just no fun. So save up your money, do it right, do it once then move on. After this you can spend your life on the beach cost and guilt free.
This is happening all around the country, with every theme park and even fairs I used to take my kids back in the day to the Wisconsin state fair. Now you're thinking, Wisconsin, okay, can't be that bad .4 kids 17 years ago 500.
😮
Oh he’s white. We should care. But they seem like good ppl. It’s the news fault
Time to stop going to Disney, to bring the kids to the beaches, to sports organizations, to fun natural places that are all small cost activities.  And they will be HAPPY.  Disney... not worth the costs.
Last trip I took my wife, niece and nephew for a 1 week budget trip at the all star. A 5k vacation ended up costing over $11,000 with food being so outrageous 4 slices of pizza and 4 sodas totaled $78. I have been going to wdw since the 80s. Next trip will be universal. You can stay in universal for almost a month for the cost of 1 week in Disney. They are going to go under and price themselves out if existence.
I’m never gonna go there, and if I am, it’s cuz I’m not paying
Hold up! Asking a kid without a job if $1400 was worth it is nasty work! 🤣
I stopped going to Disneyland for this very reason - not worth the money.
2:18 absolutely love how she's forced politics into this as if it actually matters who's in office and who's not lol.
Never again
Breaking news:  theme parks are way overpriced 🤦🏻‍♂️
John Hammond: "I didn't build this park to cater only to the super rich..." Gennaro (The Lawyer): "ok well maybe we could have a coupon day... or something."
This guy is from YouTube I knew that voice was familiar.
Why do the people keep going there?? Is the worst place to take children!!
Sound like a high cost per fun minute.
LADY SAID,,INFLATION IS BETTER NOW 😂😂😂😂😂😂  SHE HAS NEVER G9NE GROCERY SHOOPING ,,WOW,,,,PRICES ARE GOING UP UP UP 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
🫤 Just going to a movie theater is 100 dollars for 4, if it is the 5-dollar movie, still 50.00 with popcorn and a drink, I guess buying a package to Hawaii through Costco is the same cost as driving to Disney's from San Diego and eating at in and out before getting inside Disney, the cost of a small water bottle is 4.00  Disney. The magical world for children is a nightmare world for the one paying
ANR ITS PACKED😂😂😂😂😂 3 HOUR WAIT FOR RIDES😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Who cares, the foolio would spend thousands on nose bleed seats for a bread and circus event
That's insane . I guess my kids will never see disney . We stick to the splash pads and pools at our rec center and the hiking trails close to home . Mine are all teens now and they would choose outdoor activities  with family before disney anyway
Under the last administration? She’s an idiot. Turned a Disney story into a political jab. Wow!
👍 FLYING WHEELS 🛞 👏 👏 Keep Watching His Videos to Help Him Pay Back that Disney Day!! 👏 👏 🌎 🏃‍♂️ 🤗 🧙 💰 📺 🔔
"under the last administration  *YET THE REPORT IS TODAY* this is the saddest place on Earth, this channel is make believe 😂😂
His math isn't very good. 5 lighting passes would be $175, not double the price. Dudes a cheapskate
People who can't afford Disney should not be going there...
Ive done week vacations cheaper than a day trip to disney
Rent a movie n keep 1395.00
Totally wasting money and teaching your children that plastic crap can make them happy. What a shame
It’s true!❤. We all want to bless our children and have family memories, but the costs far exceeds the memories.  There are other things you can do, be fiscally responsible have wonderful memories❤
Nobody forced you to go there. If you're fool enough to go and pay those prices then you're fool enough to lose your money.
Easy, don’t go
Gotta pay for all those woke movies that bombed at the theaters.
Go to Universal Studios next time, it's better 😁 and cheaper
I stopped going just before Covid hit, don’t miss it
Support woke, go broke.
I remember when it was $25 for 1 ticket.
Like apartment complexis and other communities sometimes there's a good in all of this high cost of admission. It prices out all the rift rafts, you know the gangsters, the juvenile gangs, the criminal eliminate, in other words the people who take greyhound, fly Spirit, and use public transportation.
Eff Disney.
Universal studios is the same way!
to bad everyone in fla knows do not give the mouse your $$ .. so this fool complains ..what b/s  then ask a kid if its worth it ..heck she did not have to work for it ..spoiled brat .. he is the that not smart hammer in the bag thats for sure ..
Not for me   We too poor   Some one can afford it   Its still open   😂
Early 2000’s it cost my family of 4 about $200 - 300 for a day at the park. That’s when you could also buy hopper passes from people who did not use all of their days, so it was actually much cheap than that.
Hes a fool, if noone paid those insane prices, the prices would go down.
Crazy how Walt wanted it to be cheap for families and wanted to have kids go in for free
F sakes had to add propaganda into the regime media interview..losers..prices have not come down at all Biden was 100% better than NUMB NUTZ as POTUS.
This is news? Theres nothing better to post than this??
Well sounds like Disney is rip off these days, I went many years ago when I was a teenager, parents bought the family tickets to Disney  for Christmas back in mid 90’s and even then my parents had said it was pricey at that time.
I prefer to load up the truck, grab some snack at the store, pay $20, drive on the beach, park and the kids have a blast. Much cheaper.  😊
Annual pass holder.  Pay one time and good alll yr. No parking cost ,etc.  Greart😊est value ever
Good job slipping in the “it’s gotten a little better”. I sure haven’t felt it
They need to recover lot of money after all their woke garbage box office disasters
I was ready to call him a complete idiot for not researching prices ahead of time but this was 100% for clout. It couldn't be more obvious. ESPECIALLY when you're standing right in front of your YouTube plaque and channel name.
thanks for paying the entrance fee and leaving. You're the best kind of customer
My sisters addicted to Disneyland - she’s 46 😂
Pretty much every tourist trap in the country charges exorbitant prices. And with the present economic situation in the country, most people will choose not to go.
$30 just to park should be an outrage alone before entering the gates 😢 Shame on Disney...
Sounds like if he knew his kids, they could've sat at home and played monoply. And just been out a dinner with family lol.
Go to the water park 😂
I'm more shocked that any parent would wanna take their children to woke groomerland
This isn't news.
Still trying to blame Biden for the cost of things!
Thats why i go to coney island instead and just imagine im in Disney world
Under the last administration. Its still expensive now more than ever
ALL tourists sites are expensive. Even concerts, state fairs or other events, everything are 2x-3x the price. So as long as people keep paying these high prices, businesses will keep selling at these high prices and slowing but surely keep increasing prices. If a $1,000 concert ticket is sold out, it'll be $1,200 next time... and it will still be sold out. So the root of the problem isn't the businesses but the people who are paying... driving up the costs. Simple supply and demand. $1,400 yet still thousands of people in line, of course Disney will jack up prices.
Everytime I went there or almost any park there was conflicts and some chaos. People arguing and fighting amongst each other and families getting frustrated. This is probably one of the reasons why.
Surprised they don't charge to leave.
BOYCOTT DISNEY PARKS!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂 Went to Disney for my 8th birthday in 1974.  Had an enjoyable time however I was NOT impressed.  I had never been much of a Disney fan. On the way back home I remember one of my parents asking if I enjoyed my birthday present and I replied I did, but Astroworld was better. 50 years later, and I have never been back.
I went years ago and it’s wasn’t cheap. I wouldn’t even consider going after their woke agenda.
Unfortunate, but Disney isn't something you're automatically entitled to
I thought people stopped going to Disney world years ago
Disney is a Money Machine. Literally  a Money Monster.
“There is no such thing as “fun for the whole family””. -J Seinfeld
Go to a national park or the free beach. I r just teaching consumerism
I just came from Disneyland and don’t recall spending this much lol. We stayed at Residence Marriott which had free breakfast. We also packed snacks instead of eating too much at Disneyland. At Disneyland we only ate at their carts which were corn dogs, turkey legs which weren’t too expensive. Also we ate out to eat at Tacos Los Cholos which was cheap $30 for 15 tacos! They close at 12am also.
$1,000 is the new $100
Fox host is a total liar
As a Democrat who doesn't watch much Fox or CNN, I think many of us can shake hands and agree that things have gotten more expensive and that's not likely to go away in the next four years.   We must demand more from ALL of our representatives. One nation under God Strong 🇺🇸
We going to beach and eating sandwiches, don’t even bother with disney
I boycotted Disney after they turned their backs on Johnny Depp for a false accusation from his attention hungry ex.
Not the best way to go viral.  It would have been better a video. How to save$ 2000 for not going to disney
just don't go sad but ..
And yet he paid it willingly.  So tired of this upper middle class whining. Some of us just want to he able to buy food without going broke
Go to Legoland.
I have always hated Disney, now I hate it even more.
What a Joke Disney should be disgusted sick its all about how much they can scam out of the public🤢 🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮
Never visiting Disney they wont steal my money😂
Imagine traveling from out of state
Stop rewarding bad behavior!
Thank Ron DeSantis.
I can’t even blame the park for the high prices. It’s packed to the brim with people everyday, what would u think would happen if they lowered their prices? The park would be even more crowded. The only way to lower the crowd is to raise the price, but people still keep coming.
Duh-what did he expect? I’m glad he said no to the kid who wanted the $45 lightsaber. It teaches kids the value of money and earning things
I wouldn't go if I won a trip..
Alot of people most likely put the entire trip on their credit cards and  by the time they get done paying for that Disney Trip, it will probably cost 4 times as much.
She loved being inline with her family and talking with them? Ummmmm... sounds like it was worth it just to know that.
Greed! Outrageous money cost
Disney needs to make more parks
Never bought any products from Disney and never regret it 🎉. To go camping , fishing , swimming in a lake in a quit place is cheaper and you make great memories ❤
Craig can afford it! 😂😂😂
Its not worth it in my opinion. Outrageous cost!! 😮
He's a small business owner. Seemed he had the cash to spend. I wonder if he gives his customers a break?
You know  what is shocking i lost 9k in stock market because I expected it's gonna be better under trump ..
Ridiculous cost for these amusement parks!
Remember tourists will pay for this, and their currency is strong, so cheaper for them.
Last year, my son wanted to go to California’s Disneyland with some friends and I have a ton of points on my Chase Disney Card in which Disney made it virally impossible to use because it takes months to jump through all of their stupid hoops. Disney and Chase Bank should be a shame of themselves.       I thought only communist countries and communist companies would do something this dispicable, boy was I wrong! 😢
Disney is NOT family friendly!! As a Christian they started a war on the natural, nuclear family when they gave into the LGTBQ(whatever you wanna add) agenda. They are greedy and probably help fund all this democrat indoctrination. We don’t support any of their new movies and most would agree that their movies are less than sub-par these days.
People can’t afford groceries but somehow they can afford Disney. We are the richest poor people in the world. Make it make sense.
Should of bought BITCOIN instead.
yeah, I've been saying F Disney for years. they are greedy, predatory A Holes.  they know that it's practicality mandatory that every kid has to go to Disney Land/World, and they completely exploit that fact. it's disgusting. they are supposedly family friendly, but it isn't true. they don't even do their best to make sure the visitors get the best experience they can. rides are always shut down, lines are ridiculous, food is marked up like they handed concessions over to the Pentagon. disgusting.
They could’ve talked on a back porch for free that’s ridiculous
This is a stupid news it's like the father walk in & not knowing what the price is..I went to Disneyland 3 times this year for 300 got the promo..if your dumb & stupid ya you pay more but if you dojn your homework before you spend money you will save lot...........pls anyone goin to disney dont expect the food is cheap for sure they are pricey just like if you goin to airport if you buy small bother of drink it will cause you over $5 ....
These arguments are for the privileged!
Yeah Trump said he will turn the economy better again on 1st day, but came to know on the 100th day he made it worst again. Stop the War on Day 1, but more Wars got added by 100th day. 🤣
Just going to the parks comes out way more expensive than the entire vacation
nothing like spending thousands of dollars to stand in line all day
So basically he could saved $1400 if held a cookout in the backyard to talk 3:20 😂
Did the reporter say that you couldn't afford groceries in the last administration and that it has gotten a little bit better???? Is that something they have to say to keep their jobs at FOX or she is out of her mind?
So a family gathering at a park would have been just as fun and saved yourself a lot of money!!
I think it’s more the Disney adults who I see walking with the mickey ears all decked out in Disney gear from head to toe
Disneyland ain't cheap anymore
Consider going to Knotts or Universal studios. For a fraction of the price you can get the annual price and go multiple times a year.
A Florida resident doesn't know how expensive Disneyland has become??? Oh-kay
Well, YOU all keep paying them.
im SO glad I got to go back in 2008 before all this woke BS and corporate greed
Only a maroon would squander that sort of money on Disney World. Next time just say, "No!"
People need to stop going
Disney still has the demand. That means that on an aggregate level, enough people have enough money.
residents should get a heck of a break
I was totally shocked earlier when a Mother's Day card cost me $12.99.
Yeah Disney is out if many peoples League financially. It’s  unfathomable what money they are charging . The best thing truly is if possible use the Florida residents days . Leave the park for lunch or bring plenty  of snacks and water / juice or ice tea. Disney shirts are at Wally World and a lot of other tourist places outside the park ( check Ross stores ) they always have Disney shirts . Sad but true their CEO’s raking it in while mom a dad dish it out
Instead of Disney my family went to Santa Cruz and spent a day at the boardwalk. We went on so many rides for cheap and the lines were short. They had this haunted house that was the scariest haunted house I’ve ever been in.
Disney has become a tourist trap.
When I was married, we went to Disney World for our honeymoon.  When my kids were small and we lived in Orlando, we got seasonal passes and used to go to Disney all the time.  Then my oldest son worked for Disney for 13 years, and he could give us free passes.  But the company has changed -- not only their politics, but also their focus from customer service for families to making as much money as possible.  Now, I have zero interest in going back to Disney World.
Chinese saves like 40% and Americans like under 10% on their incomes on avarage. I myself save 0% percent though so don't listen to me
He is not lying my kid is graduating and going to gradnite! We live in California and his ticket was almost $600. And that’s not even to eat or souvenirs. He has been three times since he was a little and it’s more and more each time. I told him to enjoy it because it’s GradNite. The park closes for them so that’s good!!
I've never been and never want to.
What amazes me are the families on public assistance who go there and spend thousands of dollars.  I've seen their videos.  No sense of responsibility.  I grew up in the 60's, 70's and early 80's and lived a few blocks away from Disneyland.  It was always so fun, and affordable as I had to pay my own way in and for any food and souvenirs  I wanted. Years later I took my children there.  Prices were at least 10 times what they were when I went, and so many people that riding 5 rides the whole day was a challenge.  My four year old cried and asked to go home.  He's 25, and we never have gone back and don't plan on doing so.  All the joy has gone from the "Happiest Place on Earth".
I haven't been but I will never go....its for the elite
I go to Disneyland once a year. It aint all that. I dont mind not ever going again. Its just not the same its all about the money now
Disney's expensive??? Then don't go. Just think, if you save that money, according to other morons that watch Fox News, you'll be a millionaire soon.
Congratulations 🎉 you earned a "consumer" badge
well i live in the midwest . so i just do the six flgs/cedar fair season pass for a fraction of the cost. take several trips per season. you can keep the mouse ears.
Got to love how she said oh prices have gotten better since the last administration… Has she seen what the new administration did and how much things are going up?… How dumb do you have to be…. But then again she wouldn’t know she’s making millions sitting there talking to real people who just had to drop literally Half of my rent here in California…. News anchors actors etc doesn’t know the value of money till they don’t have it!
That is just pure greed, especially the parking which should be included in the admission price. People need to boycott Disney until they start lowering the costs.
Ridiculous.  Travel anywhere for better experiences.
That's true. Disneyland is way too expensive and very exaggerated! Disneyland beside is Woke company is very super expensive! This company cares only for rich people!😡
It will never change until people stop going!
Thank the Orange idiot!!!
Disney is going to charge as much as the market is willing to pay. That’s normal for any business. But thanks for posting. Saves me a trip there myself.
$30 parking is the lube before they bend you over
That’s cheap
my cousin took his family of 5 to Disney land on a one week vacation he said it cost him over 20,000 man that is some crazy stuff for sure, I took my kids to Disney once back in the early 80s for 5 days it was around 500 dollars after that we only went camping for are vacations, my grown children never talk about the Disney trip but that sure love talking about the camping trips and the camping trips were very cheep but we always had a wonderful time.
Lightning passes my butt.   Wait in line like a regular human being, rich or poor.  It makes the experience worth it.
Back in 2010 our Disney trip cost $5,000, we took the grand parents. In 2015 it was $2700 with travel discounts. We drove from PA stopping at many historical sites along the way. Great 2 week family vacation, but we have banned Disney due to their policies and woke agenda not prices. Disney has always been pricey
Ohh my we spent 7k at disney back in 2023😂😂😂
what kills me is that places with a huge admission charge also charge for parking!  what kind of BS is that?  I would, quite literally, not go somewhere and joyfully spend $1,000 if I knew in advance that they wanted even $10 for parking.
Disney is run by woke liberals, why give them your hard earned money?
Its too much, I was only once there and honestly felt fool.
If you can’t afford groceries or gasoline Disney is not the move
same exact price as my Firearm
In 1929 it cost about 2$ to get in disneyland. How the times have changed.
waiting for maga to blame biden 😂
Imagine how expensive Super Nintendo World would be.
Disney world has never been cheap.  our grandparents took us there 25 years ago with my sister, when I got older my grandparents told me that they spent around 4K in just a 5 day period. Yes, it was cheaper back in 2000, but at the same time people also made less.
Excellent answer by her daughter!
Ban Disney
And he lives in Florida imagine the cost for families that drive or fly there.
Lady it has gotten worse!
When Disneyland in California opened, it cost a WHOLE dollar for admission !! Of course I don’t think that included the ticket book !
Not only do you have to pay an arm and a leg to go to Disney, you also are paying for their agenda to corrupt more children, fuel their greed, and support their hunger for power!
Sad, $1400 to stand in line and wait! It's not worth it anymore!!!
Yall believe anything.
"....trying to pench pennies..."  🤔
All of that excluding prices of gifts
hes a youtuber with over 100k followers, thats like 10 grand a month
While those prices are absolutely ABSURD, leave the kids out of it. Poor daughter who only has to hear her dad gripe about affordability puts a damper on her memories of a fun family time. Which isn’t that why they CHOSE to go to Disneyland in the first place? Let her be a kid without worries.
The prices are high because the parks are full. High demand higher prices!
I was lucky to go to disney as a high school band trip. My family could never afford it when i was a child.
What does he expect? People like him keep paying these prices. Complaining but still paying won't deter companies from charging what they cab get away with.
Americans are surprised by basic economics. Because americans are stupid.
Well it's free market capitalism, what do you expect?  They charge this much because they're this crowded.  You personally not going isn't going to change this fact so they'll continue to charge.    The real question is why are you even mad about it?
I haven’t been to Disneyland since grad night in 2007 and it was 100 dollars and food was supplied. I have not been to Disneyland since and it seems like I may never go again.
This isn't a news story lol Disney isn't cheap water is wet
Its almost as if trump didn't lower cost at all
People can't afford the basics but we do a news story on a unplanned trip to Disney being expensive. Its a luxury expense and they charge what people will pay. Must have been a slow news day.
Don't go to Disney
Disney is a money grab always and forever
…and it’s dirty, and they have advertising stickers everywhere. If you don’t spend extra for the “get to the front of the line tickets” you will not get to ride anything but the Merry-Go-Round. NEVER again will I give Disney any of my money, there is little value for $$.
Wait till the Tariffs kick in
People can't afford groceries or gasoline at least that was under the last administration it's gotten a little it better/ Ahh Fox news never ceasing a chance to get political.
Do people still go to Disney? I thought we were boycotting anything, Disney?
Hope Disney goes out of business.  They charge so much so they can make up lost revenue on all their woke bs leftist liberal movies that fail time and time again.
Trumpers will have fun paying higher prices pretty soon!!! The idiotic moron was somebody else and it was not trump lol
Any trip to Florida or anywhere is the 🇺🇸 is so expensive hate to say this but All Inclusive trips to other countries are so cheaper and more relaxing
Take them camping, sit by a fire, tell stories, watch the stars, cookout some food, go fishing, hiking, etc. much of which is either free or very little cost and your family will have more one on one time together because you aren't in the middle of a crowd.
It's called being a captive audience - now we're trumptyland - same thing - 125% more for everything that is available outside the kingdom. Mostly crappy food.   Thanks fox for helping f everything up. You've got trump's back. Can't wait for the day the cult figures that out and gets out the torches, pitchforks, tar and feathers. A new global holiday will be born.   Do you know what happened to mousoilini?  Since history is repeating and all. How bout the supporters of king george?
You could have gone to Hong Kong Disneyland for that amount
That pricing is criminal
Too excited to sleep… NOT!
The best part was waiting in line talking in your family  Well, Kids, let’s line up in the living room every time yall wanna go out somewhere😂
A father’s favorite ride at Disney is the ride home
This is what happens when you don't have the internet, and you show up thinking it's still the same as back in the 80's....WAKE UP DUDE...this has been going on hardcore increase EVERY single year, after year, after year, after year....yea, it should be viral for being the last to know 🤣
I grew up with Disney. Now I throw up with Disney
The Greediest Place on Earth
Take your kids to National Parks, show them pure beauty,
Wait a minute let me get this straight. You’re trying to pinch pennies, but you take your whole family to Disneyland and dinner. Lol stop spending more than you need to. This is a you problem. There’s lots of things I want to do in the world, but I can’t afford them so I do different things.
There are so many parks within 5 miles of Disney world that are way cheaper and way less crowded and have better rides
The unfortunate reality for me is that I’ll never be able to take my family there.
Sooo you enjoyed your time correct! Know before you go 🤔
Sorry, this man makes it sound like it just started last week. He should have done his research before he made the trip. Yes, their prices are outlandish, but if people keep paying..........
And this is why I go to Universal Studios.
Exactly 💯. Disney prices are ridiculous 😮
there's no point in going to disney anymore, long waits and everything is expensive. i think universal is better at this point.
Absolutely ridiculous Disney is for rich people, never could bring my kids cuz of how expensive it is. Corporate greed and people keep buying into it so it’ll just keep increasing. Not worth the wait for rides, too many people now.
Boycott all things Disney. You're money supports dei & child grooming and the place is a complete rip off.
Quit having kids and the bill will go down.
Wait parking cost $30.😳 🤦
Its $30 now to park at Dollywood.... Insane...
First of all I don't know why you would even go to Disney World why would you subject your children to what's going on in that Park you're a fool
This guy is complaining but still paid the bucks and wear the ears. Stuffed his face and kept swiping the card. What an idiot. Cue the world’s smallest violin.
Yeah prices are getting better and I have beachfront property in Nebraska to sell you.
😂 don’t want to pay that don’t go. what’s up with the entitled whiney people these days.
Look at that. They spent all that money, and her favorite moment was being with her family.
And for a family of 5 you can get season passes to both Knott's berry farm and six flags for less than $1400.
Disney is a luxury experience.. not everyone is going to be able to afford everything.. work harder
Trump - Desantis economy
As long as people pay the exorbitant prices, these amusement parks will continue to increase prices.  A critical analysis probably reveals a poor value for the dollars spent.
Dads fault trying to keep up with the joneses
😂 waste of money. Imagine all the wonderful places you could visit for all that $$ 😂
BOYCOTT DISNEY. NO MORE OVER PAYING. IF YOU DON'T GO, THEY WILL HAVE TO LOVER DOWN PRICES.
The reporter had to ease that lie in there about prices during the Biden administration but failed to mention the dumpster fire the current one is creating!
Did she just blame the Biden economy for Disneys greed? Nice reporting Fox.   Just your daily reminder that they are not a news station but a propaganda machine.
If you can afford to go there, you can afford it.
White man's burden.😂
I disagree with the others. $1400 bucks isn’t a lot of money to spend on a once in a lifetime experience, let alone for several people. That’s setting aside four bucks a day for a year- pocket change in today’s dollars. Trips like this are supposed to be special. It’s okay to spend it once and have a nice time. Life is meant for living!
Last administration ? Prices haven't gone down any.
Took grandaughter to Fl. Disney in 1990s. Flew down and stayed in Disney hotel. We were like captives. Everything was super expensive. And the worst part, you couln't get a descent cup of coffee. All they had was that horrid Nescafe garbage. My advice, NEVER NEVER NEVER STAY AT DISNEY. Get a hotel nearby and take one of the many shuttle services into the park. Or better yet, go to Six Flags instead.
Foreign Tourists still Flock Disney!  This simply means that Americans are getting Poorer TO EVEN LIVE IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY!!!!  That's the reality for over 3 decades now. IN a Global economy, Americans are the Least competitive. While most countries can easily learn to speak English, we cant even pass simple education standards! Then there's the Need for college and Post-Grad Degrees---- WE ARE THE LAST IN THAT ONE AS WELL!
Paying Thousands to stand in line for hours and hours and sweat.  Brilliant waste of money.
I would rather go to a water park. You have a lot of fun and you get to stare at gyat all day long.
Ridiculous-This is a young person’s fantasy to be there. Despite the weather, and the crowds….And the over-priced bottles of water, This is supposed to be a day or days that a young person will never forget. The people in charge should listen very closely to his daughter when she says that “standing in line” was the most enjoyable part of the trip? Wake the hell up, and get back to reality. And this is how you treat residents of your state? Walt Disney is rolling over in his grave. Flat out DISGRACEFUL!
Walt Disney would be appalled.
Is that really News Worthy?  There is an easy solution.  Don't go!
He must had the money so don't complain
Greetings from Agawam Mass. I live two miles from 6 flags new england,people are jealous because i live so close an can go often,i say wait until they empty your wallet like other parks, you wont go back...
How is this the governments problem Disney is a private company they can charge whatever they want to whoever blames a president or administration for this is just dumb typical dumb Fox clip trying to play politics
Well, the good news is that he made more off his social media post than what he paid for the day.
So ridiculous that these huge, greedy companies feel the need to charge way more than things are worth, shutting out low-income families. It's not fair to kids whose parents can't afford much. My adult son wanted me to go to Disney this year with him and my granddaughter, but I'm disabled, on disability, and work part time, and I couldn't afford it, so we're not going. We went a couple years ago and it was pretty spendy.
lmao thats nothing, last trip was 1300 a night, 200-400 dollar meals 3 times a day, not including planes, trains, tour buses, shopping ... why dont you try saving up first so you dont look like a cry baby online hahahahahahaha
Cool answer from the kid… I gotta remember that when my family is waiting in line. Make it fun and memorable during the experience!
I figured it would be more than that honestly.
I love Disney but I will not pay the price of a new car to go to Disney for 5 days. In 1997 a trip for 4 to Disney including air fare, park tickets, hotel inside Disney and a rental car cost us $1,500
“Under the last administration “?
Robbery
I loved her answer
Surprised these attractions are still gouging top dollar when American Tourism has dropped in half and still declining. Ridiculous greed and poor business practice
America…. The greediest place on earth…
If only someone would stand up to these mega-corporations and billionaires fleecing the American people.  Oh wait, that's not going to happen with 47. The opposite is happening. We "sacrifice" as he calls it, they profit.
They gotta make up the difference  from the snow white flop
You shouldn’t be complaining if you paid for it
Disneyland turned to trash after Walt died.
Stop being cheap!  Go out and have fun with the family at all costs.
I would dispute the charges
Minnie gave birth. Mickey did not have health insurance. He needed to get the money somehow.
Greed period! The Ameican hard working people can't  afford a Baseball game as long as we put celebrities and sports  on a pedestal   its our own fault. Stop buying into thier greed. Take your children to a community baseball game have a picnic  and a real family day. They live in Flordia  imagine the cost to travel cost of hotel food and the Disney experience its out of hand. Stop visting stop watching Baseball there is more to life then sports and one day at Disney.
THANKS  TO  WHO  BIDEN    AGAIN LOL !!!
People relate to it 😂 only rich people can go to Disney. I can barely cover my monthly bills
I once went took my family to Disneyland and we rode a total of 12 rides for the whole day and we traveled from out of state. Between the fuel, hotel, meals, parking and the tickets. Definitely NOT worth it. Even my 7 year old told me that it wasn’t worth it.
Rip off and cess pool of international disease. NO THANKS
Just a suggestion, family planning is a good thing.🤭
Why would someone be in shock? The prices must be posted somewhere. Foolish.
under the last administration?  LOL Your joking, right?
Glad my kids are grown
A people trap set by a rat
It’s the magic kingdom because it makes the money from your wallet disappear.
Can't afford it, don't go.
It’s crazy!  $195 per person just to enter!  So expensive.  Oh yeah $30 bucks per person for lighting passes for 3 rides!
GOTTEN A LITTLE BETTER......hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaqhahaqhaqhahaqhahahahaahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
hyperinfation is going to be painful and alot of people are going to die..
I’d never pay that.
Dad was so proud after she said that he was about to start crying.
Imagine being Canadian. We add 50% to that trip!
Florida is the new California
He's complaining now?  Just wait until he gets divorced.
No way!!! Id rather go to the beach
99% Americans will never go or take their children. This is for rich people
BOYCOTT and prices will go down
When have they been cheap? 🤷‍♀️
When do you think it’s cost money to be alive like to be born, so if you don’t come out of the womb with money in your new born hands then I guess you don’t get to live because your parents don’t have money. So here it is I’m claiming ownership over all the breathable air on and in planet earth, yes that’s right you heard it here first I own the air that you breathe, now let me guess you don’t agree so who cares I said it first, now that’s $1 a day and you get to breathe for that day $1 x 9 billion, $9 billion a day is what I make if you don’t agree then to bad who cares what you want I got what I wanted you don’t think so just ask around if they know they’ll tell you.
Of course a MAGA man playing the victim, Bro 😎 you dropped over 2 grand on a whim , you must be doing well with the business, why complain and play the victim?
For a three day pass for one park a day for a family of three it's 720 dollars
You people blow your money on this dumb sh*t, in debt…buying fancy cars/trucks, vacations you cant afford. Stop giving money to these people!
No matter if it's a day or a week, the Mouse gets paid!
Pay a lot for Woke garbage. No thanks.
My husband and I go to Orlando every year. We went to Universal Studio’s ONCE in four years. Now we just stay at the hotel and walk around universal city walk. That’s it! We’d love to visit Disney Hollywood Studios, but I’m not willing to pay to get in. Too pricey!
The parking at the parks is similar to the outrageous cost to store luggage and pick what seat you want on the plane after spending the huge price for the tickets. Another way to rip off the American people.
Maximizing shareholder value and satisfying Wall Street. That is what it’s all about. No sentimental value in Disney anymore. It’s just another cut throat outfit.
“Under the last administration?” Is she joking?! NO ONE CAN AFFORD ANYTHING NOW!! THANKS TRUMP!
Boycott disney
If talking to family was the highlight, family could have saved alot of money sitting around the kitchen table playing a board game.
and all the while mickey mouse is making minimum wage SMH
Yeah I’ll stick with six flags 😂
Can't imagine a hotel in the park
Its not worth it. Disney needs to do better!!! And they are Florida residents and it still cost that much. When we went it was a last minute trip as well in 2021. My advice is you should've went before covid we didn't get the full experience of Disney due to the restrictions and the lines was sooooo long. We did 4 parks in 2 days. PEOPLE do not ever try that. My feet is still in Florida. But hey we do anything for our kids so save up for the trip.
Not surprising that Disney is that expensive.
Just wait until American families find out how much it's going to cost them riding on the "Trump Train"...... All aboard.
I will NEVER go to Disney. Cost waaaayyyy too much!!
Yea I rather take my kids  fishing 🎣 😂
Its almost as if you could have googled this shi…
If the place is crowded I guess patrons are tolerating those insane costs
Key 🔑 statement!! We’re all trying to save pennies and with our current president and tariff’s it’s only getting worse!!!
My girlfriend has a co worker that is married to a Disney world employee.  We get in for a free. Its whatever now.
😂😂...you don't need 30 Dolls with trump- Just one $500 American 🇺🇸 made one...👩
We went to Disney Springs and that place will EAT your MONEY! 😅 I couldn't believe how expensive things like a stuffed animal were. It was by far the most expensive aspect of Disney World!!
Right when Disney hears "I just loved spending time on the line with my family": ok guys so there's this new fee "spending time on the line with the family", but if you buy the special pass "Family Time" you get a big discount each time you wait in line.
Try sleeping there, a so-so room on the main grounds must be minumum $400-500 a night now, it was $400 a night 25 years ago...
We completely STOPPED going to “Disney” many years ago when the new owners flipped everything it was suppose to be about.  At one time it WAS a great place to go…for children and adults alike.   Their new agenda of promoting perversion sickened us.   WHY would good people want to spend that kind of money to support them in that?!   Children don’t understand… they see only what the facade is.. and delight in all the fun thereabout.  Adults should know better… this “woke”  and greedy group has no problem corrupting the minds of the innocent….just a little here and there…bit by bit.    -RM
There are other places to go that are far more education, fun, and/or beautiful. Just say no to Disney.
straight up scammnmm !!!!
❤- Trump O Nomics ....Buy American 🇺🇸 Mickey Mouse got a family to feed
Another solid reason to boycott Disney if you haven't already.
The kids didn't care bro. Line up smineups.  We care. I'd care. Adults care. They don't care.  There's always a fine line of letting kids be kids and not letting them in too much on adult problems. ESPECIALLY money lol that's why it's a fine line cause you wanna teach them and have them understand the world
I thought everything was supposed to be cheaper with mass immigration?
Good luck at a sporting event as well.     You will get tapped out.       They hike the prices up so bad.      Better off just staying home     They don't care about you!
And u guys probably only went on 3 rides because of the 2hr lines
I seen the Disney castle Hotel room, princess suite saying that you’re meant to feel like a Princess  no it does not look worth the price at all to be in a sweet it needs a whole new model upgrade completely they should have a nice little small little balcony going off the castle really making it worth. It’s wild making it really feel like you’re a princess. No, they don’t have that. I think it’s more worth it out of all the hotels in Disney Animal Kingdom because you don’t wake up every morning and just see a giraffe out your window. The castle isn’t worth it maybe to go see but not to spend the night in.
I will never go to Disney World.  Disney World is a breading ground for pedifials.
A fool with money is soon seen.........and he and his family were sure seen.
Walt Disney would be furious!
how is this a shock or rather a story? the dude did it willingly paid for it
Trip to Thailand cheaper
Taking a cheap shot to the previous administration like if we're not doing worse now
Couldn’t pay me to go to an overcrowded theme park to stand hrs in line..my idea of hell 😂
charging for parking?
Walt Disney is turning in his grave.
Bend over!
If people would stop going they would have to lower prices to get people to come again
It's called supply and demand.  If people can't afford to go to Disney then it wouldn't be packed and with huge line-ups.  Don't go to Disney if you don't think it's worth the price.  You have the choice to spend your money elsewhere.
Go to Universal Studios! 👍🏻
Problem also is a lot of people go to Disney land to flex how much money they have to spend. Middle class Americans love complaining about high prices but what they're really trying to do is show off how much money they have to spend. It is never "Look how expensive this is, I pass". It is always "look how much I had to spend but I still did it"
Disney is woke demonic why would you throw down your hard earned cash in that?
Disgusting.  American Capitalism has killed itself, the end is near.
You don't really need to buy their food there. We packed up, and eat while waiting in line. Saves time and money.
$1400 split between 5 people is not a lot
-And I made $1800.00 a month-: Thanks to all that have invested in my future:  Missing my Dad today😭.  I’m so glad I have some wonderful pictures from 2006 with my parents and my two daughters.  A NEW HOPE. (Collected the pins and loved the Disney Princess photo ops + the autograph book).
As out of towners we didn’t know your parking cost can be used at the multiple parks and kept paying that parking fee at each one. On our last day the parking attendant told us what we could have done instead.  The lightening passes are so expensive. Again we bought them for Epcot which was a waste of money.  I spent a lot on our trip there. I don’t have too many regrets. I never been to Florida so it was a fun trip. Saw the Kennedy center, Universal too. I just know now what to do to cut costs. And yes Disney Springs I don’t think is worth it. Downtown Disney in California is better in my opinion. We cut costs by eating away from the parks as much as possible.
Disney has never been cheap! And it’s not for the cheap and complaining. People literally set aside monies for a Disney family trip.
Clearly the huge lineups means others don't mind paying that much lol it is ridiculous how much it cost to pay for a day there but nowadays it's expensive doing anything. Might as well stay home if you spend it and dwell after.
But that was for five people. 200 + for five people for a day at Disney with food, that's not really all that much.
He forgot to mention being thankful to be able to afford to take a vacation with his family. All choices of free will.
I Live about 45 minutes outside of Disney. I have always known it to be the place we all want to go, but no one I know can afford it.
Boycott??? Maybe 1 week
Disney was closed the last administration?
And that's WITH a Florida residence discount.
This is news worthy???
Devilish mice 🐀
Instead of enjoying hes trip with the family the only thing he does is compare, what mor0 n .
C’mon Fox ,   Blame  The Dems !!  Wokeness, DEI … something
Parks, playgrounds, nature. Free and healthy.
I’m in my 60s now, but remember going to Disneyland (Anaheim) as a youth!!!  $35 for entry and we brought our own food (hotdogs wrapped in foil, snacks and soda in a can).  I haven’t been to any of these amusement parks / theme parks in years as it has gotten so expensive to go even for one day.  I’ll take my grandkids on different kinds of adventures … e.g. horseback riding (via a guided tour) through the countryside, the forest or the beach … still cost some $$$ but the excitement and smiles from the kids is priceless.
My best part of Disney was LEAVING 😊😊😮😊
Ur paying for Disney movies that flopped.
No one in our neighborhood ever went to Disney Land or Disney World. Yet some how we all survived and were able to have successful lives as adults.
Disney has always been expensive, this is not news.
She is a good girl 😊
DON'T GO !!!
Disney is a scourge on Florida.  Disney ruined Florida.  I wish they had picked a different state.  Way too expensive for an average family.  Shame on you Disney,  don’t you have enough money???
To me it's Greed! Going there is not for the average person. I knew  it's expensive but the price is outrageous.
I am glad i am boycotting USA
Cause he's a Youtuber......so he gets view$
And the worst part is you are funding a satanic cult...
What a sweet child dad raised. 🙏
This is the best reason to show II. will never spend any money at. Disney
Everything is out of hand.  Went to a NHL game with a friend.  We each had two beers and one bratwurst.  Cost was 150 dollars.
Take the kids out into nature - to see the beauty of this earth - it’s free…
Stop giving people who hate you money that includes, Disney,Netflix,lacks,,muzzle ems, and many others.
Yeah I used to think one day maybe I'd like to visit there but I've known for years I never will due to these prices. Who can afford this? And some people go a lot! Sporting events are ridiculous, too.
I remember tickets at Disneyland used to be at least $70-$160
went 3 summers ago with all our 5 kids. Had to save our income tax return to be able to do it. 3 days. one day at Disneyland in Southern Cali. One day at Universal Studios. One day at SeaWorld. Let me tell, all but the 2 youngest toddlers agreed to money was not worth it. The lines are so long you get to do maybe 5-6 cool rides in a full day. You spend majority of the time waiting. Food is subpar for the prices.
It's very simple.  If people boycott Amusement parks, sporting events and concerts, it will be a wake up call to the thieves in charge.   The internet is a powerful tool, people could band together and force the prices down,,,if they can just LEARN TO BE PATIENT.   But too many people have the mind set of "life is short, I want it now."
Gotta cover that Snow White loss somehow!
We spend 8k for 4 days, plus we committed the stupidity of eating in the German place (Epcot) and it cost me 600 for 7 people just the buffet and regular drinks 🤦🏽 Disney is very very expensive
You aren't forced to spend your money there . As a customer it's your fault Noone elses ,it's like people complaining about drugs ,if you didn't buy any of it they would have Noone to sell it to so they go away !
No shame.. she actually snuck in  “that was under the last administration”. MAGA cult is the least accountable, excuse making regime in American history.
Don't be fooled by this guy, he comes from money, has money, and constantly complains about it. Multiple homes in NH and FL. He can't relate to the average American. That disney trip was nothing for him.
What do people expect prices have been like that? Lol i love how everyone is acting suprised when they been pricing out. My local theme park is the same cost as Disney. Mightest we’ll drive to California for Disney land. If you also plan properly and save up and put it down the line it hurts less lol. Save your money don’t go in debit for Disney lol.
The Smokey mountains/ Dollywood is the same way.
Disney isn’t for poor people. That’s what makes it nice.
You know its bad when yt people start complaining 😅
That’s near how much Universal Studios charges $200 per person in a party of four or more. Children under 12, are $120? Knott’s Berry Farm is more affordable.
He still paid for it.
Stop going.
Camping is as low as $10 a night and you can travel across the country.
While I can afford to go to Disney, I’m not going to do that. Hard pass. My kids don’t even like Disney movies, and I don’t like the company. I’ll spend my money elsewhere.
this guy is a fool. Fl residents very cheap if you use common sense. Go to the Outlet for the lightsaber. They can’t give them away.
And now you know don't go there until they lower down the price
Stop supporting this name this amusement park what ur supporting is child exploitation abduction and its this company is about greed and evil promoting wake up America
The nice thing about Disney it’s LUXERY not a necessity! If you’re penny pinching you can go to free community events investing in the community. All kids want is to spend time together as family. If can afford it Disney is a great experience that’s why the parks are so popular.
Ha why should we care about this guys bitching???
I chose SeaWorld over Disney, the prices are SICK across the board...
President Pumpkin face says kids are only allowed 2 toys now 😂
Haha fools keeps spending ya money. That what we want. Please. Just keep being stupid humans we love it
😂😂😂
No sympathy for idiots that feed these corporate Giants their hard owned money.  There are hundreds of things you can do with your family for much less and your kids will still have fun.  Dude is just not too bright 🤦🤦🤦
Boycott places like this until they realize their money grubbing practices need to stop. Disney is making tons of money and it doesn’t need to be this expensive!
Like we say …. Don’t come to Disney if you don’t have money go to national parks and free beaches…
That's so sad she mainly remembers chatting & having a good time with her family instead of having a good time on rides probably since she barely got a chance to ride😢 so sad her chore memory is that instead of park memories!
Do research first......duhhhhh
Insane. I went to Disney a few years ago. Total waste of my time.
Take them camping next time and talk around the camp fire.  crazy prices to wait in lines 😫
Nobody cares if you've got to spend a million dollars at Disney they're woke and their garbage and if you want to give me your money don't cry
These parks are my literal hell. Corporate greed at its finest. When I was a kid prices were more reasonable and you could actually  get on most of the rides you wanted. They let in so many people now it’s impossible to enjoy yourself anymore. Packed in like a bunch of sardines!
This seems to only be an issue in America. Went to Japan and Disney tickets were only $55. The snacks were also significantly lower than they are here.
Please… you know what you’re getting into before you go, he’s a used car dealer from New Hampshire on YouTube just looking for views!
IT IS FORTUNE 500 COMPANY GREED  GREED GREED GREED
Honestly our government has no idea how people are suffering these days. I much feel sorry for the disabled people who don’t get the help they deserve
Disney is trash
The interviewer did not exactly support the fathers complaint but ended up making it “worth it”? Didn’t understand the mixed message here.
Disgusting, go to Universal Studios. Her final answer was really cute, they didn't need to go there to talk, could have gone anywhere. ❤
I think it is justified. There is nothing else in the world like it and they are adding newer and better attractions all the time. Guardians of the galaxy is the most expensive roller coaster in the world. Quality comes with a price
--Funny I have been watching Craig for years on his Youtube channel and he got more views b/c of Disney price gouging.
Well he had to pay for 5 ppl but yes it’s too expensive!
So how can all these foreigners afford it with all their kids???!!!!!!
Paying a thousand dollars to wait in line wow
Someone has to pay for Disney's woke agenda because they now make movies at a loss 🤣
Mickey mouse has become a rat
I went to yosemite a couple years ago and I had a blast there it was simple but I enjoyed it so much with my family
Always trying to blame the prices on Biden lol.
The happiest place on earth is   Sweden 🇸🇪; not walt disney world.   And it’s cheaper too!
Walt would be disappointed
Made in America is not cheap 😂
Imagine complaining about the cost of something and then being dumb enough to pay it.
This is to pay for the money they lost on Snow White
Disney been stealing people money and kids. An yall still support them i feel no remorse
Dad took them there eyes wide open about costs but complains about it afterwards?
I will never go to park again without the lightning pass. Never been to Disney. But any park waiting 1.5 hrs for 2 min ride isn't fair.
This was for family of 5, so stop bitchin about beacuse you can afford it and you knew beforehand
You couldnt PAY ME to go to disney wyta
A fool and his money are soon parted.
They have to make up the loss from  live  action  snow white  !
Eggs Cost $12 for a Dozen now.  Gasoline Price has been Creeping up under Dim DonOld. 😊
*Or just go to a national park derrrrrrrr*
Did he ever take his family of 5 to a NFL game?
Honestly i'm not surprised  rumors I've heard it was expensive?  It's almost like a down payment for a used  vehicle  depending on rhe year of the vehicle.  Seriously,....
Kinda crazy the left calls billionaires like Musk greedy but they charge a family $1,400 for a day at Disney lol. Stop paying that and they will magically be forced to lower their prices. Your dollars are funding that crap.
My mom and kids and i went and stayed there 7yrs ago. With hotel and food and pic package was 9k
Disney been expensive for over the last decade! Where have these people been? 😂 keep paying it and they’ll keep charging it
Can’t put a price on your family’s happiness
I used to work at Disney. Probably 90%of the people working there have a second job because they don't get paid enough. I've literally seen people sleeping in their cars because they can't afford housing. They don't even give the employees free meals, Disney still make them pay. It's really sad
You can tell the little girl's answer at the end was a surprise to her dad, cause he looked like he was gonna cry. 🥰  You done good dad.
Only option get rich simple
spending that much money for that fake BS?    i’d rather go to the mountains and enjoy ….
Just returned from our trip, the LAST TIME. Outrageous prices, used less than 30% of the products. Never again. $8K plane tickets, $1600 hotel, $1450 tickets and fast lane, didn’t want to stay in line for one hour for a 5-10 ride. Insane? you bet. We’re staying local from now on.  The most insane thing is parents bringing newborns, and toddlers who won’t remember a thing. Only bad memories and my nightmares. 😅 Never.
Now tell us how Greg and his Texan oil cartel are laundering money from Gringos and Mexicans, don't be hypocritical Gringos politicians!
A day of hiking and kayaking will provide far more fun and family time together than anything Disney World has to offer. It will also cost a tenth the price.
Thanks Biden harris. It  will get better eventually now but Biden messed up e everything.
Yep.  Nope.
Pinching pennies and Disney doesn't go together well.  Lol
Disney used to be a happy place, now it becomes a greedy place. An outrage of corp greedy
What we're paying for is the Technology they're using to entertain us with.
Wat a wonderful family tho fr
America wake up quit for this crap
Yep. We're a family of 5 as well. Had airfare for 5 as well. Hotel too. It was a one and done trip for us.
Fk that. Disney doesn't deserve it
Won’t go there
who the hell would pay that money? its telling she asked the kid the best part, and she really didnt have an answer...cuz it sucks there. i went 16 years ago, and have no desire to go back...to top it all off , they're one of the wokest corporations
He must not have a child in competition cheerleading...😂
It's sad you're complaining I want to see Mickey I give out candy on Halloween I want to see Donald Duck I have to go to the park with bread and throw it in the river quit your crying
Wouldn't give that Woke place a dime. Walt Disney is turning in his grave.
Took my family for a week in 2013 and it cost $10,000 then... I can't imagine what it would cost now....
High ticket prices, long lines, overpriced merchandises, etc  - it’s not worth it. The girl said the best part of the day was waiting in lines to talk to family? Thats a slap in the face for Disney entertainment
In 2010 I went to Hong Kong Disneyland. It was $60 Canadian per person to get in. I know, that’s like $5 USD, but at the time it was allot (and still is allot).
I mean it is a family of five what you expect that’s not that bad for five people come on now
From another Florida resident to a Florida Resident it’s INSANE!! I’m a single mother and going to Disney isn’t an option bc of the cost. It’s over $300 for 2 people. You barely see any Characters other than a parade. You better off hiring character to come to your house. LOL
This guy and his MAYBE DAUGHTER are complete sell outs what a joke.
Bro said I paid $100 for these ears so I’m wearing em.
$1200 for a family of 5 to eat, park and create life long memories is nothing in my opinion
Not worth it
I wonder how much prices have increased for Americans…since Canadians have refused to vacation anywhere in the States. 🤷‍♀️🇨🇦👏
They're successful content creators, they wouldn't do it if they couldn't afford it. I don't feel bad for them
lol it has gotten better? Trump’s tariffs especially with Canada and China is gonna drive inflation higher than anything Obama or Biden ever did.😂😂
Dumb Maga
Disney is a failed company that passes on all business loses to consumers. They are such a scumbag anti family values company.
As an aside, how relatable is it for most men that the wife is just having a great time and smiling and laughing etc... completely oblivious to the cost of the "fun"; while the husband is just the bank card and thinking how many hours of work it is to pay for all of that.
I live in Florida born & raise . You just gotta know the tricks & the right ppl to get the best prices
He lives in Florida should have used public transit.😂
For that price you and your family could easily spend several days at any European Amusement Park - all of which have several Picknick (in- and outdoors) areas and allow you to bring your own food and drink by the way. Disneyland Paris (France) day ticket: 56 Euros (61 Dollars). Because no European would ever pay American prices, they'd go out of business.
Should buy annual pass!
I lived in Orlando for four years and never went to Disney.  It was always a blatant rip off and FL has a reputation for overselling everything so when your there the lines are so bad you can't do much anyway.  Rip off land.
People still go to Disneyland? 🤣🤣🤣
This is old news, everybody  knows Disney parks have been expensive for decades
Simple fix: if you cant afford it, just don't go. He obviously can afford it, he just doesnt like the prices. Its east dont go, and you wont have to pay it. I'm paying $2,800 for a family of 6 for 2 parks and 3 hotels.
What was your favourite? His daughter: Waiting in lines bc I got to spend fun time with my family. Dad: 😳
$1400, Floridians get a deal compared to those who live outside Florida. Try over $9000. In 2017, I took my family of 4 on a trip to WDW. We stayed an entire week. Went to every park. Stayed at the resort. Purchased the food plan & fast pass. I do admit, the fast pass is way overrated. At the time of our vacation, I believe we paid $150 for all 4 members of the family. We only got to use it 3x per day & it had to be scheduled. That was a crock. By scheding the fast pass, ya have to be in that park & close to that ride, when the time nears. Essentially, the fast pass is useless. You tend to miss things when your on a schedule. I thought vacations were to break the monotony of the 8-5 BS.
Disney has always been expensive. It’s not new but the more you pay the faster it is , is ridiculous
He's complaining, but how many people can up and go for an unplanned visit to Disney without having to save up for months or even years beforehand?
When I was a little girl Disney prices was $45.00 per person we went all the time... A band to ride all rides free... Utterly Ridiculous now...
I grew up near Disney, admission was $39 and parking was $5 during the 70s and 80s. Disney World is a city now. It's a 24-7 operation. Everything is expensive!
By the end of 2019, U.S. national debt is only  $22.7 trillion.  Joe Biden's presidency, only 4 years increased $14 Trillion more to $36.2T in 2024. How much of this funding was actually received by the average American household under  pandemic relief programs. where did the largest portions of this funding ultimately go, and were there instances of it benefiting specific political figures or interest. All the Americans take consequences of abusively printing dollars.
Sorry to say, but this has to do with overpopulation. It’s not even inflation, as much as it is that no matter how much it prices people out, there is still a number of people that CAN afford it and fill up the park. That’s how overpopulated the US has become as we approach a half billion in the country.
And that is not even including stay and rental car if you are not from Florida
Disney is trying to recoup the money they lost recently after they're woke movies have flopped and they're left donations didn't work out for them.😊
That's actually not bad for a family for a day trip.  I expected it to be much more expensive.  No, I've never been there, too poor for amusement parks.
Guess where Disney gets all the money to finance those money losing movies?
Anyone that goes there now, deserves to get fleeced. So many state and national parks with family friendly hiking trials or other similar family activities for next to nothing to do.
Go camping next time !  No lines ,less cost , more time with family
If Disneyland had reasonable prices issuing limited number of tickets per day, it would be a more honest.
It's all the dads fault he kept pulling out the card and he could have said no now crying about it weak beta male 🤨🇺🇸
I thought it was expensive 5 years ago…Jesus
Yes, but share holders are happy.
Disney owns fox.
Stop paying it and they will stop charging it
Glad I'm not going there 😂
I remember going when they had the coupon book for like 27.00 a day
LOWER THE COSTS DISNEY! YOU'LL GET MORE PEOPLE. WAITING IN LINE FOR AN HOUR IS B.S.!
Disney an evil corporation -- nasty evil woke garbage
We’ve come so far from your small dealership lol
If you're complaining about the prices, you should not be going to Disneyland! You are the problem! You keep supporting them. Why would Disney drop their prices when people keep giving Disney their money?
I mean the guy could of done the research first before going. Lol its Disney its going to be expensive
There is no reason for being so GREEDY!  DISNEY needs a Reality Check! People pay the prices so they will keep Charging High!
Stop supporting 'DISNEY', nothing but greed
That Disney trip is how I feel every time I go to the grocery store.
I’m glad we got Disney out of our system in 2019.  We dropped lots of $$$ on our one week stay.  I enjoyed the resort we stayed at.  Disney definitely a money pit.
This mf just wanted a viral video to pay for the trip 😂.
Thanks President Trump and little meatball everything is perfect 🫡🫡 🇺🇸
Disney Land is a trash company. Disney go F*** yourselves.
Disney prices r ridiculous
Could have saved the money and sat u. the backyard with your family kiddo. lol
Well, if people can still paying the price, they will keep rising it. Capitalism, free market 100%. If you do not like that, do not give money to them. Just saying.
Glad my family and I aren't so crazy about Disneyland....feel bad for those who are but can't.
I can relate last summer I was planning a trip to Disneyland I like to wait until all 5 of my grand kids are here, they come for a month every summer from NJ with 1 living here in CA with me. I added all 5 kids & 2 adults to the shopping cart for 2 day park hopper for a whopping $ 3200 add in meals, Hotel, keepsakes I was well over $ 5k. Disney will never see my grand kids again 😂 And the lines, Heat, in L.A during the summer is draining. Disney needs a huge wake up call .
Yea that’s why I don’t go. The cost is such a joke
Yup I’m not planning one visiting any theme parks
Everyone you talk to after them visiting Disney resorts complains about the staggering costs. So quit going or quit your whining
I remember when my mom would pay $10 per tik for 12 kids 😢
The fact they have a 100,000 subs on yt and they complain about money 😂
In 1989, a four day pass to all three theme parks cost us $100, $255 allowing for inflation.  Obviously, the park has expanded over the years, but the closest equivalent now is over $700, almost 3x as much.
RIDICULOUS!!!!
Thank you, Sir, for coming forward.  Load help us😢
Boycott Boycott Boycott Disney
supply and demand. disney needs to raise prices even more to reduce the overcrowding...
This is news? This shouldn't be surprising anyone anymore lol. 😅
This is nasty...
Such a stressful and miserable day in age to raise kids   So sad they are the future they will work while we are retired..
Last time I took my family for 3 days was over $10,000 for food hotel etc… I bought fast past etc…
lol with the world not visiting US, it comes down to you American to make up the difference of corporate profits. You can thank Donald Duck Trump for this.
My 3 girls haven't been to Disneyland.  I refuse to pay that kind of money.  Oldest is already 18 years old.  I live 10 minutes away.
Come on...ppl live in a bubble called the credit card... living beyond there means...they pay enough once a month...2 keep the facade..
No sympathy, you choose to go, you know it’s beyond expensive.
This aught to Woke u up
WHY WOULD YOU GO THERE ? IT IS OWNED PARTLY BY CHINA. THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE HOMOSEXUALS  🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍
The father looks like Ron DeSantis on ozempic
Best part of Disney was... waiting in lines.   Bro, i could do that for zero dollars at any grocery store.  😂😅😂
The clue the solution to stop this is stop going to those places stop paying them your money 💵 it’s really not worth it 👎🏼😭🥴🤨
And trumps disastrous policies only making things more expensive! Absolute worst president in American history!
Walt Disney was a questionable guy, but I truly don't believe he had the level of greed in mind when he designed Disney World. It's not a family destination anymore. It's ridiculous that a family needs to spend $1000 just on tickets and parking alone.
Mickey Mouse hungry for money money greedy
I'm 67 now, I worked there out of high school, and it was only 8.95 to get in. The tickets were like 12.95 and it was a book of tickets. You gave a ticket for each ride. Their pricing themselves out of business!
Note the dig at the last administration and how things are better now. Fox being Fox.
Its been a decade since I last was at Disney, I spent roughly $750 for TWO 3-Day passes WITH Park Hop in 2013. I'm scared to research that trip now
Since Disney is turned WOKE, I boycott. Not Faith Base.
Why didn’t he research prices before going? Based on the background and this guy’s shirt, he’s just advertising for his small business. Typical.
I miss "E" tickets.
Clearly he can afford it so..
my wife and I used to go to Disneyland once a year since we first started going out but not anymore because the tickets are ridiculously expensive and the place is just way too crowded. The last time we went there was to celebrate our wedding anniversary but we kinda had a lousy time because we basically paid a lot of money just to fight crowds and wait in two hour long lines to get on a ride and most of the time they had technical difficulties with some of those rides especially the new ones. It’s not just Disneyland, but I feel like a lot of entertainment places only seem to cater to the super rich.
Last time we went (4 of us), my friend's son-in-law, who works there, got us into Epcot for free. We only had to buy one ticket because he could only give us 3. And we still spent a lot of money just eating inside. The prices at souvenir stores were ridiculous. We noticed there were a lot of people from Brazil. Come to find out that Disney endorsed banks to give families loans to go to Disney. If you spend enough time finding deals online, you can ease the cost a little. That's what my wife did the previous time we went. The more theme parks you select, the better deal you get. I think we got a package for 3 parks for about $2,800 back in 2019. Add to that airfare, eating, and all the extra costs. To me, it is not worth it unless you go a time when there's not that many people. You have to stand over an hour in a line just to get into a 2 minutes ride in the scorching heat. We enjoyed the inside theater shows more. As a family, Animal Kingdom is the best one. But in reality, you're paying for a brand name. Disney is not as magical as it used to be when I was a kid. Spend all that money on a better trip like the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone Park. But I have to admit, Orlando is a super cool place to go 😅
How is he pinching pennies? He don't even know what it is to pick pennies spending 1400 for the attraction.
Yes, it was bad under the last administration, but it has already gotten 10 times worse under this administration and is getting even worse with his stupid terrors. Thank you to all of you guys who elected the Orange Racist Clown.
Bidenomics, thanks JOE!
1000$ is cheap for Disneyland
Lol. Thats about right. He made a mistake of eating dinner as a family in Disneyland. I can relate being the dad and swiping the card each time would make me cringe
I just took my kids to the waterfalls, beach and got some good food.  Spent maybe $300-$500 for a family of 7 for 2 days of fun
Dollywood is fantastic, super fun and affordable. I wouldn't go near Disney at this point for so many reasons.
Imagine how much longer the lines and bigger the crowd if it was cheaper
This is such a silly and so unserious story im cackling 😂😂😂 yall CHOSE to go to Disney
Dad needs to refuse to give Disney money! Stop just stop! Your kids want it guess what it’s a NO!
Disney and a lot of other "luxuries" were cheaper when everyone did not have a VISA card.
Robbery
It’s cheaper to travel abroad.
Making millions. Employees can't afford an apartment.
That’s my rent for a month
15 years ago, our family of four could do Disney for one week for $1000. That included hotel, tickets, and food. Back then 15 min was considered a long wait for a ride.
Stayed there for a week and it cost me around $5000.  It cost my ex with her 2 kids about $15,000.  Never again.
I thought Florida residents could get a yearly pass at a fair price?!
There are whole flights of foreigners who come wearing minnie and hickey hats  heading to Disney obviously. Just the flight I couldn't imagine the profits the airlines, hotel and Disney made because that is no day trip for them
It’s like complaining why business class flights are so expensive and the Gucci purse costs so much.
Of course, it’s worth it for the little girl. Daddy’s paying 🤭😁
Wait til ur kids have kids u probably wont be able to afford it
That's nothing!!! Wait till he has to pay for the transition  an genital removal for all his children for taking them there
lol at the moment about the cost of groceries being less now than the previous administration such fear and pandering by Fox to the Trump administration a disgrace and completely false. The most I’ve ever paid for eggs or gasoline has been under Republican presidential administrations. It’s amazing what can be achieved when those that vote for you are extremely gullible and need to be lead like sheep and told what to believe 😂  Looking forward to being at Disney next week I’ll be going for free as I got the Disney credit card and am applying the $400 sign up statement credit to the cost of the 2 tickets. As a result of this Disney will be the most affordable part of my vacation.
$300 for parking for a day? I have never been charged that at Disney in Orlando
Not to mention that the park has no big updates for decades very old and the food is trash
$30 is what the admission price was not too long ago 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
lol, pay to have your kids groomed, smart ppl
What a whiner!!! Don't you know how to look up prices and budget??? You are just looking for your 15 minutes.
It would be nice if Disney would build another park so the crowds would spread out. Maybe one in Texas.
Same ridiculous prices with Disney cruise ships😢
Same ridiculous prices with Disney cruise ships😢
Wow Disney should be ashamed but the won’t be I’m sure.
Shame on Disney.
If people continue paying, they will keep charging it. 🚫
The democrat party thanks you for contributing to the donation Disney will make on behalf of all those who got fleeced at their parks
trying to give the kids the dream ...
American wages are stagnant.  Workers underpaid.  Few benefits.
Yes. This is insane. Plus the lines are outrages. They oversell.
These people are going to spend the money because they are disney freaks. Stay away from Disney Channel and ABC and espn and Hulu and then save alot of money not going to Disneyland.
Lmao bro Fu>< DisneyWorld
It’s becoming a rip off….
This is NOT what Walt Disney envisioned. He would be TICKED if he were still alive.
Conservatives are dumb and poor! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I dont understand why complain about the price and paying for it. You didn't have to go in the first place. If you could hear your future self say the costs per ride per person is not worth it, you probably would have not hit submit payment. But you did it anyways.
Why is this on the news?
Poor baby
Stopped having anything to do with that ugly company ten years ago. Walt would be ashamed.
As a FL resident we cancelled our season passes. Those lightning passes are about another $500 for a family and that’s just one day. It’s insane. $6 for one bottle of water I don’t understand how they can gouge ppl that way. We go to SeaWorld we have season passes we love it and we have little wait times in the lines and they can get a souvenir every time because they don’t gouge us as bad as Disney. They also have the best coasters hands down. We love Sea World and will continue to go and we haven’t been back to Disney since 2014 and don’t plan on it! Disney needs to go broke for all they have done to their once loyal customers.
The Fox propagandist almost slipped up for a second!
1,400 pinch pennies?
Minute 2:20. WHATTT BETTER?
When you go, knowingly, to a Clip Joint, you get clipped! No sympathy!
STOP PAYING IT !!!
Welcome to Trump's world! Why is the Host grinning! She is engaged to her lover, Sean Hannity, so she has to spin it in a positive way or, he'll Report her to the Anointed One. Her voice grates on my nerves... 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
Not only that you have to pay for your ride to get in a faster lane 😂 Disney is a joke
U have to start a go fund us, 2 go 2 Disney…..😂
There are better parks to visit.  We always went to Universal
2:15 Under the last administration?
I don’t understand the concept of Disney.  Walking around in the heat, on rides and food but I can do that here in Ohio and not die of heat! so I’m spending all that money to see a costume??   There are so many beautiful places you can go in the mountains in the beaches and see beautiful views, not concrete and plastic.   I’ll save my money for the views and relaxing!    The little girl had the sweetest answer waiting in line because she gets to talk to her family?!? So sweet! I love it!
They’ve always been overpriced and ridiculous! Glad my kids are happy w the beach.
It’s a F U B A R place after all!
Yet, this guy is making money off of this YouTube video while AT DISNEY 🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️ News coverage and he'll get more people to view his channel. More views more money. He wins in the end!
Kids and mom had a good time cause they ain’t paying 😂😂😂😂 only us men understand this
I've been to Disney several times over the years, and it's always been expensive relative to other parks, but not at this level.  I did think that Florida residents got a break in the prices, which I guess is no longer the case.
I don't know how this play stays in business. But if all of a sudden, one day not one person went to that park, it will cost you a hundred dollars all day.That's ridiculous price to go into a park for a day.That's crazy
Yes this not definitely not inflation! It’s greed!
Pioneer Village is way less expensive.
You could of took a trip to a Caribbean island for the same cost for much longer
I don’t feel bad for him. Why go just to complain? If people stop going then the prices go down. Swear people are morons.
Don't go.
This is why my mom told us we're eating before we go to Disney and eating when we get home. We just went to the park and got refreshments during the 6-7 hours we were there. Not meals...not souvenirs..not anything extra. Sad that it has always been expensive....and I'm about to be 43. Florida native.
He's paying for 5 admission tickets...1400$ isn't that much for an amusement park. Why complain, get to work & not cry on tv about it.  If you cant afford it don't go.
Still cheaper than that financied car note
Oh yeah Disney is so freaking woke too!
It is really ridiculous that Disney charges so much just to give your children a wonderful memory.
This "dad" makes a ton of money from his YouTube channel. He should be the last one to complain. So fake and unimpressive!
Don’t eat there and don’t stay there. There are lots of restaurants and hotels in nearby Kissimee.
What!?! It hasn’t got better. It’s worse now.. lol Prices are nuts ..
Now there going to charge for Disney family time waiting in line..
Plan ahead ,get a job there work for 30 years and get in for free and get discounted food also....the house of mouse was an experience. Network thru the system and had a great time. Thanks walt
WWE is charging $40,000
Why put yourself through something you don’t enjoy, and in the process, make others uncomfortable too? Honestly, no one at the Disney theme park seems to be having a good time. The employees wear forced smiles while working in 100°F heat inside heavy costumes, and visitors pay outrageous ticket prices for an experience that feels far from genuine. Overall, it was a disappointing experience, and I don’t believe it’s the kind of environment we should be teaching our kids to enjoy.
Walt would never let this happen he would be ashamed of what the company has been doing it’s ridiculous I went to Disney back in September it was a little pack but very expensive tho but I did manage to do something’s with the family I also saw some cool stuff I wanted to buy buy there were to pricy so I didn’t bothered buying the stuff
It's the same in California. It is not a family place price wise. It is pure corporate.....if you don't have the money. don't do it.
I was there the year it opened. I’ve never been back. Haven’t missed a thing!
My wife and I started going to Disney in the 90’s! Everything was included’ fast pass! Park hoping! ! Now we can’t afford Disney anymore! It’s cheaper to go to the beach!  I wished people would be crazy enough to stop going to Disney!  You’re crazy paying there high prices!
Epic universe is better and cheaper. Your money goes further
Get on YouTube and search for Disney Rides, expedition Everest is good and your in the front seat.  You don’t have to pay outrageous prices dont have to pay for parking, hotel accommodations, boarding your pets if you have them if family or friends can’t watch them, airline tickets and the cost and possibly crashing.  Save that money and pay for bills use the same amount for a payment of your mortgage, use it for taxes on your home, repairs for the house or car.
This is a news story. Privilege at its worst. You knew it would be expensive before you went..
This is not inflation this is us Citizen stupidity… we keep pay more and more for things we don’t need to.
Imagine how much is costs to keep that place running..
No more😢😢😢😢
I applaud Flying Wheels for wanting to do something special with his family, but likely for that kind of money they could have rented a cabin somewhere for the weekend.    Its like it has been said Disney will charge exorbitant prices so long as people keep paying them.
Looks like he went simply to make a video on the expense of it all.
Tokyo Disneyland is amazing. Cheapest Disney park and the cleanest.
Everyone wants to go viral, no shh Disney is expensive and has always been expensive you knew that before you went and you still went.
At Sea World in San Diego parking starts at $35. To park  closer one can pay $70. A hotdog is $8.99+tax.
Nah hes just broke
Yeah no sh**, he bought FIVE tickets 😂 if he was paying for one person instead of FIVE it would have cost about $300 for a day trip. This is like buying 17 coconuts and then complaining that the experience of eating a coconut is too expensive 😂
Why go to Disney, the company that’s been putting out mostly garbage, for the past few years out of all amusement parks? The company you can’t sue if  you sign up for their streaming service?
He not lie i spend 600 in one day just at Disney so yes i kmow the feelin just for the kids to ride and eat and have a little fun
I just went to diamondbacks game and was 50$ parking 20$ hotdogs 8$ at special vip bar. Worst quality food I ever ate. Machos were stone cold and came from package. Hot dogs are bar S now since they sponsor baseball and worst bun and dog I’ve ever had. Tasked so bad but I ate it only to get worst heartburn I’ve ever had amd non Stop burps. Similar to reaction from drinking gasoline trying to siphon. lol. Needles to say I’ll never eat at a game again nor go to a game.
Paying for all those tanking films
This doesn’t surprise me. Nothing is like the good ‘ol days where you could go to a professional baseball game or music concert for a more affordable price.  I feel like if people keep going at these outrageous prices than they are accepting it and nothing will change.
Someone has to make up for the huge losses incurred by the demise of Snow White. Surely one should be able to do an online price check BEFORE going to all the trouble and expense of wasting a day at Disneyland.
When I see reporting by Fox News I have zero confidence in the their integrity
Disney and WWE have something in common
3:00 If that child’s favorite part was standing in line with her family take her to the DMV for free!
Disney is doing a daylight robbery.
And you think this is a problem. Wait until Trump has been your president a flew months more, then you will feel problems. 😢
Capitalism 😮trickle down economy 😅what could go wrong 😅😅
I know it’s a shits show, but if you can plan and afford it then don’t go
Companies figured out they could hike prices and we will still buy
P.T. Barnum said it....."There's one born every minute."
Why anyone would give a red cent to modern Disney is beyond me
Trump will Close it down  like the rest of Florida and America .
Wow is expensive I haven’t went to Disney in like 10 years, it wasn’t that expensive back then…
Might as well paid another 1,000, and went on a cruise.
Thanks TRUMP
Everybody knows places like this are exspensive. If you pay the money then you lose the right to complain. You didn't have to go
You don't buy tickets! You are going into a magic experience. When you are going on a trip you just loose yourself! Don't be Alan Harper! 😂
I gave up on Disney long ago. Took my daughter the one in CA when she was 7 now she is 19. At the time, I thought it was ridiculously expensive from the tickets to the foods etc. The lines to any amusement rides were very long and it would take weeks to ride them all as it would take only 3-4 rides then the time was up to go back to the hotel. Zoo, local arts center, local park were the places we enjoyed most of the time now.
The happiest place on earth the most magical place on Earth the most expensive place on earth 😂
I do agree, to stay at a Disney Park Hotel and purchase theme park tickets, food and drink has got over the top expensive. But that doesn't mean you can't go. Just do your homework on alternative ways to do it. My daughter and I went last April. We stayed at a Disney Partner hotel for 4 nites and 5 full days. Flight, hotel, Airport Uber and park passes was under $2000 for 2 adults. The hotel provided free park shuttles. We went on every ride we wanted to and some of them several times. I brought granola bars and snacks from home. Ate at a quick service restaurants for lunch and shared the meal. Disney is very generous with food portions. We never paid for Lightening passes but as we stood in line, we watched families of 4 or more in those Lightening lanes and then we would calculate how much extra they spent just to be a little ahead of everyone else. Some of the attractions were clearly a waste of money to purchase Lightening Lane passes, but people still did it. So, I don't feel sorry for them when their credit card bill comes in. Disney is taking full advantage of the "ME FIRST"  mind set and the people who don't know how to say to no to their kids. Just like Cancun or any other destination vacation you can spend a little or spend a lot and still have a very similar and great experience. My advice, go during off peak seasons, stay at a partner hotel that offers free shuttle service, book discount airlines such as Spirit Air and if you are letting your children buy a souvenir, then give them a budget.
That same price can get you a great week at the beach.
I know plenty families who are supposedly struggling and still manage to take their kids regardless..Disney probably knows that all kids would love to be able to go to Disneyland one day so most parents will figure it out atleast one time in their child’s life no matter the cost
STOP GOING THERE!!! DO NOT PAY FOR THOSE PRICES!!
But yet you kept paying and paying like an I.d.iii0t. Dont blame disney, blame yourself. You had a choice. Should have stayed home. Should have not gotten married. Should have not had kids. Those were all choices and all those choices cost money....lots of it. Dont complain now.
The great Disney scam lol.
It's sad but I kind of get it. If they made it affordable way too many people would come. Heard the lines are already out of control.
Disney is obscene . Plain and simple.
Disney understands that only a certain  percentage of the population will overspend in order to have this once in a lifetime experience. They are billionaires based on this premeditated business model. The experience is worth the debt....Facts!
Talk about getting MILKED!!!
There are so many national parks, trails, lakes, etc. Disney is a waste of money!
Bro. Did you not pre-plan your expenses?
Expensive? Yes. Does it keep the ghetto element out ? Definitely. Let’s go to Disney world kids 👏🍭🎊🎉
It is not just disney charging these prices for tickets and parking. In California there are PLENTY of parks that charge that. Even neighborhoods you have to pay to park in the street if you are not a resident.
Now that’s one day and they already live in Florida. The cost from out of state is insane. You need hotel and plane you looking at 5 figures minimum
I live an hour away from Disney. I haven’t gone in 15 years. Probably never will go again.
2:21 Delusional and false comment about grocery prices are better under current administration
Just go to Holiday Day World, problem solved.
I spent the same price for two people for the California Disney park
Disney is wondering why attendance is down as prices are so expensive. Find alternative locations is the answer.
It's so expensive!
Walt Disney is rolling in his grave yet again.
Home of the mouse that died due to wokeness, and now they want you to pay for that funeral...over and over and over and over again
Lol, not I said this little piggy bank
Disneyland,  The most expensive place on Earth.
This reminds me of my dumbass ex who borrowed $1500 for Christmas she couldn't afford but drinks starbucks every other morning 😅😅😅😅 why shes my DAs ex 😅😅😅😅
You don’t have to spend 1,400 for standing and talking with your family, a nice hike will do! ❤God bless you all!
DISNEY SUCKS!
Love the pretty comment about the last admin is if eggs are $10 right now
They are trying make up a lot of money for the losses of the stupid movies Disney had put up… 😅
Try coming to California to visit Disneyland. It will cost 3 times their trip to Disney World cost!!!
He can afford it. He just got a cyber truck and buy cars like it’s water.
He looks like Ron Desantis. lol do they just look like that in Florida or something ? lol
So what he knew before he went. We all know the cost its called Google.  He's looking for fame and a sponsor. I live in Florida, and it's normal to spend that type of money.
My brother paid for a trip to Disney World when my son was six and I couldn’t afford it because I was a single mother. He took my son and my daughter me and his wife. It was a trip of a lifetime and there was no way I would be able to afford it back then that was back in 98. I can’t even imagine what they pay back then. Now I I am glad he got to go because he didn’t never get to go again unless he pays for it.
$1300 DOLLARS haha I spend that on a shirt
The “Disney” experience has been loss for a couple of decades now. That money is better spent at a family friendly resort or cruise.
Why take a shot at last administration pushing politics for no reason. Prices been going up for the last 6-7 years under both administrations!
I have family in FLA and the last time I was at Disney was 2008 when my dad, myself and a cousin went to Epcot. That was fun and I know we didn't spend a bajillion Bucks because my dad is tight and wouldn't spend dumb money.   1.400 Bucks for a day at a amusement park?  I don't have that kind of money to spend for that kind of flash in the pan "fun".
Showing my age here, When I was 10 my family went to Disney back in 1983 when Epcot opened and a one day pass for MagicKingdom was 17.50. Sounds cheap, but with inflation rates in the 80's compared to average incomes, that total matches the economy then. But yes, a one day ticket for 180 dollars is a tragedy for most families.
These prices are absurd !!!!  no problem here you go💰💰💰💰
boycott disney 😊
That's how THIER building in DUBAI,GREEDY,great waste of $$$
Just stupid to go there for that price!
Praying
This is what politicians do they charge you a couple thousand dollars to stand in a long line to meet them, or maybe even for a small dinner and people in America just cough up the money knowing its of no benefit to anyone but to make the politician richer.
While wearing the ears.... 🤦🏾‍♂️
It's not worth it, none of them. I did go to Disneyland in 1968 and 1982 but that was well before corporate greed took over. The people that go now get fleeced. Ridiculous.
You wanted Disney, here's Disney for you.. stop complaining lol
@3:10 very smart kid!   Smarter than most adults because she didn’t conform to everyone complaining and didn’t look very affected by all that social pressure to complain.  Everyone look like she was about to give a negative answer, but she actually paused and gave the answer she wanted to give.   She can actually think for herself.   She’s absolutely right, long lines can serve as quality time themselves too.
Went to Disneyland two years ago to celebrate our daughters college graduation.  Both my wife and I came home with covid.
I go to Disney for a week, family of 4, $4k tops. I don’t know wth you people are doing but wait for specials at least lol.
Way too expensive.  It’s about $6-7 grand for a week on a tight budget for 2 adults.
If Absolutely everyone just stopped spending money on anything, chances are that jobs will fully shut down. And Trump is gonna get screamed at for this madness.   Money is literally becoming an income Madness
Great video horrible prices
Waste of money, save it for your kids education or something useful.
He complaining about how expensive it is then buys the merch
And he bought the hat...
Why would you even want to take your kids to this disgusting place
Do yourself a favor and avoid Disney!  Their priority is to see how long you can stand in line while extracting the maximum amount of money from your wallet!  The Magic Kingdom is a Ripoff!
It’s called price control if the prices were lower, the lines would be even longer and the experience would be even worse. They keep the price is high to keep people out so the people that do go have a more enjoyable time. It’s pretty simple. Imagine if everybody could go and only pay $500 for the day how many people would be there and you would never even get a ride one ride it’s just about supplying demand you up the price trying to make the value better for the people if you lower the price of the entry, no one would enjoy their trip very simple
One thing about white ppl, if they don’t like something they gone do something about it 😂 hopefully this will lower the prices for all of us 💯 👏🏾
If he has a YouTube channel about travel then going places is a business expense...he needs a good CPA (or research himself) and start writing these charges off.
He's either the kind of dad that will jump and put himself and his family in danger or get his family into a situation to put it onto social media for attention.  You're either loaded, so you don't need to worry about cash or be proactive and do your due diligence so you don't fit into the categories above. I think he's an attention who re.
Wish I could complain how expensive it is😊😂❤
Is this with Donald trumps  tariffs in place you just have to pay for it or get Donald Trump to shut it down. That is Disneyland. It’s not the same anymore with the tariffs that Donald Trump introduced. Come to Australia. We got better theme parks will let you Americans in but you’re not allowed to stay Donald Trump voters.
They have make up the money someway for those horrible movies that no one sees
I will not take my grandchildren to this groomer park! I thought American Citizens have had enough of the Perverts Pushing Unnatural Agenda on the Peoples Children! People there's no in between your either A normal Human being Or your a lost Cause! People need to make a choice! Time is getting close to a Climaxing and Its going to be Dreadful and Scary! 🤯
I think it is BS that kids under 12 or something are 170 dollars while adults are 180. What do they expect these kids to have jobs to pay for the ticket. Make the kids 50 til your 18.
All while your daughter is being eyeballed up and down. Research public arrest records.
How is this news? He planned the trip right? I assume? He didn’t see any of the cost before hand yah okay… not news
Expensive cost of living under Biden?Have you been watching the news ? I guess not if your sitting there spewing lies. Yes Disney over rated .And its not that appealing. I.d rather sit snd listen to the seagulls .
Hotel costs!!
Last mouse world was in October 2002.  Bad knees now, and would never go again, even with good knees.
If your stupid enough to support Disney in any way you deserve to be ripped off!
Standing in line, conversing with family? You can do that for free anywhere.
Disney is a woke, socialist crap hole.
I have heard from all the people that I know that have gone to Disney Land that it is extremely expensive.  Most of them told me that  afterwards when they reflected on their trip, that it really was not worth it.  Personally speaking, Disney Land/World has never interested me to see, even when I was child myself it never appealed to me.
You're an idiot if you pay anything close to that just to go to stupid Disney.
If you have children. The world hates you.
Whenever I go to theme parks, I never pay for parking. I went to Disney World on a solo trip and I took the shuttle to Disney from my hotel or I take public transportation. There are plenty of buses to take you to the park. And Disney meals may be expensive,  but a lot of them are shareable in size.
Why would he be shocked? It was prepaid. Did he not look at the checkout cart before purchasing?
This man has no idea of penny pitching, I can only dream of taking my kids to Disney , honestly it breaks my heart . But maybe one day
I'm so glad I got to take my kids to Disney in the 90s when it was still relatively reasonable.  I live in Sweden now, and at least Disneyland Paris is a little more reasonable. Not by much, but a least you can take the train there and not have to deal with paying for parking theree.
It’s called capitalism. Companies will charge that much, because people are willing to pay that much.
If you keep "paying" for it, they will "keep" charging it
The money that you give Disney doesn't turn out good for some children. Wake up!
I'm surprised it took this long for a common reaction to Disney's recent unfair prices to reach the news.
I would NEVER, EVER go to disney again.  HUGE waste of money.
Wake up people, if you keep going they will keep charging more and more.
simp
Didn't even have to pay for lodging
The last time I went to Disney World was over 10 years ago and the prices were ridiculous then.  There truly is no Disney park that is worth the cost of admission.  This is also true for the other Orlando theme parks.  Now the only park I consider is Busch Gardens in Tampa.
Going to Disney?  Plan ahead= booking ahead saves a lot of money! Look for deals! Call around. There are places and online stores that sell tickets! Ask for deals! Some customer service people will give or find discounts for you! 1 day trips are not worth the expense. (IMO) I took a family of 5 to Disney for 5 days, 4 nights. Meals and Hotel/Resort included,  and the price tag was $2400! I can not imagine spending so much for 1 day!
I use to get California Select Annual Pass $99 and $15 Parking… I was a single mother and blackout days were nothing compared to being a single mom local!   I cry that this opportunity no longer exist for anyone but Wealthy. 😔
Its pricey but its a family of 7.😅
It was half the price when we grew up. I am disappointed in the price for Disney.
so stop going are our stupid or what?
White people problems😮
Aw you can tell he’s a fun and good dad 😊 the only way we made it worth it 3 years ago was going with someone with a military discount. They military discount is the ONLY way to make it even remotely affordable unfortunately
Good father God bless him and his family
Wilddd
It's just a scam targeting children and women
Don't give Disney any money there a scam nowdays!
I never been to Disney World and wouldn't ask my parents to take us because I always thought you had to be rich to go. Even now as an adult I still would not go because of cost.
Ya f that!! We went a couple years ago and NEVER again! Cant even ride all the rides. The wrist band thats supposed to let you skip the line is straight B. S
I didn’t have the “luxury “ to go to Disney. So why I gotta go to it now as an adult ? I don’t see it.  If you wanna spoil yourself or your children that’s on you. But I won’t.
Don’t support them. It’s ridiculous how expensive it’s become.
Things are only going to get more expensive,  quite the opposite of what humpty Trumpty said 😅
It’s not worth it. Your kids will still love you 40 years later if you never even say Disney.
Don’t go?
He’ll no
For it to be packed like they said it was.. seems Americans are doing fine with these struggles and high prices
When will you men people wake up? Men, stop giving in to your wives via the kids. The kids set the tone, and the wife puts forward the agenda and the husband hands over his balls. Get some balls, men! Say no to this foolishness and dare them to get mad.
No matter what anyone says Disney is extremely overrated, and is not worth the price.
Did he not know the prices before he left home to take his family of five to Disney World? If so, he is very stupid. EVERYONE knows Disney World is expensive. If you can't afford it, stay away. Find something else to do with your family. I'm sure there are less expensive amusement parks in Florida but a social media diss of those places would not go viral, would it? I'm bored with people like this. 🙄😫😴
20 years ago you could get season passes with unlimited visits and with parking for $120
I clean 2 vacation rentals in Anaheim, right across from Disneyland. I have seen the receipts guest sometimes leave behind and how much is spent on certain items.  The one I can’t get over is the cost of brunch at Goofys Kitchen. I seen a receipt for a family of 5 and it was close to 600. Apparently drinks are extra, there was 2 mimosas on the receipt, plus the cost of orange juice for the kids, taxes, and tip. That is a lot of money! I know it’s most likely good and lots of fun, but very expensive!
Uh, duh.
I lost respect when they fired those IT workers and replaced them with H-1Bs from India.   Humiliated them in the process
When they cant make money off movies they rip off the park  customers
What, you think 50 bucks is too much for a Dizzyburger, Goofy fries and a Tinkerbell Soda?
it was his choice, anyone that goes, knows the consequences
I spent  $1,400 for a whole week at Disney World in 1990. Two people, 4 nights Caribbean Beach. 5 day all park passes.
someone should pay all the debts because of failed movies and projects probably.
You can go to the supermarket and talk to people in line 😊
What a shame, I will never go to Disney world again
Funniest thing is when she says it's gotten a little bit better! Are you blind, or just insulting our intelligence ??Orange clown is doing even worse then grandpa president! Wake up people!
Stop going to it and the Prices will drop. It's REDICULOUS!
I went in the 90’s long long lines
A sucker born every minute....
No one should ever go to any Woke Disney properties. The cost of going, just to wait in long, horrific lines is definitely not worth it. Do not support them.
Prices out the riff-raff. Can't have nice things.
I went ten years ago and looked into it now. No, just no. We are going to Sweden and Denmark for half the cost ...HALF with airfare and beautiful hotels and train tickets
trump tax will hurt disney pretty bad
224 dollars for Dinner
Ridiculous prices, extremely crowded, about 30% of the rides are broken at any given time,… The crappiest place on earth!
I'm a Floridian, and I'm with Dad, and I'm not gonna lie, I will not spend  $1,400 for Disney.
What was once the happiest place on earth is now the most expensive place on earth.
I'm 44 and it's always been my dream to go to Disney World but the price of going is why I haven't went yet
Precisely why most Americans are broke.
wah wah white people problems. of course they find a way to blame Biden for something too
Seriously rich people get to jump to the front of lines?
When I took my three kids to Disney it was astronomical for the five of us. I would not do that again
Disney is the worst way to spend (burn) money. Not worth it.
Do the lighting pass. Yes that's more money, but you'll be able to get on every ride in 30 minutes or less. Gives you time to character meet a great, and take all the pictures you want without feeling rushed most of the day. Its still crazy expensive but if you're going to go all out amd spend $1,400 you might as well spend a couple hundreds more.
Most trips you can get a week out of it but 1 day for 1,400 is pretty sad..
For some people Disney is a cult. And visiting the motherland is a requirement.
OMG.
For $1400 you could fly the fam to Washington DC and checkout all the National Monuments and Museums..
No thanks. I won’t help fund their agenda. I have such fond memories of that place. It was literally the happiest place on earth. Now it’s just…lost.
The economy did not get a little better. How delusional 😂 @2:23
The “Magic of Disney” watching all your money disappear….
one word  "OUCH!"
f. disney
Its because its a white family they are getting media coverage....this world is doomed
I'm happy he exposed disney
It’s about supply and demand. Even though they have plenty of demand in their backyard where they could build another park, ease pricing, and keep the dream alive for middle class families in America, they choose to build a new park in the Middle East instead. Talk about greed.
Next time take your kids to the Disney store tell them to pick out the toys they really want and they will tell everyone they went to Disney.
Don't go if you can't afford it, simple. Every dad I ever spoke to who went to Disney says the same thing, it's expensive, so 6 Flags it is
Been to Disney World 3 times. It now not even a option anymore to vacation  there.
Yep. This is Disney simply being greedy! Sucks bc I’m just a normal hard working guy and I can’t afford to take my children. I’m currently saving up for it.
Don't forget; you paid that to go on 4-6 rides per day; waiting in line for the remainder, or walking around sweaty waiting for the lunch reservation you made five months prior.  That said, I will continue to take the grands to Disney every 2 or 3 years until they are "too old" for it; staying at a Disney Resort and spending five days there split between two parks and the resort.
Thats ridiculous!!!
Danm a g a day that's crazy
It doesn't matter; even with the high prices, it is always packed, and there is a long line. So it's working for Disney
Disney is for rich or upper middle class.
Haha “Pinch Pennies”, goes to Disney…
There’s a lot cheaper lines you can go stand in.
I am convinced big company leaders sit around a table and laugh that people blindly pay their high prices! We are sooooo stupid. Stop paying, people, and the prices will go down. Its not rocket science.
Too woke for me
Take you kids to real things! Go to the lakes, mountains and forests.
I won't go back to Disney! was there many years ago ,but never again. Woke Disney!
Nothing wrong
I went with my family to Disney and Universal during Covid, it was great because there were no lines :-)
Look at him! Why would he pay those prices and then wear the stupid costume?
Don't  go..... duhhhhh
What do you mean the last administration you dumb b”””&@
My husband very seldom tells me no, however...he refuses to go here
They make it so unaffordable for Americans who live paycheck to paycheck why?
I can see a bunch of people around a table trying to incorporate getting to know your family while waiting on line into an ad
“…that was under the last administration”😂😂😂😂 ok cause things have been immediately better under the current administration can’t make the propaganda up
I go solo so it’s not as bad. I cannot imagine paying for a whole family.
She said "Its gotten a little better since the last administration" what? Lol its the same if not worse now
Yep, $40 bucks for two hotdogs and crappy fries too.
Does Disney advertise on Fox?   hmmmmmmmm
I don't even get how Disney parks still exist with these prices. It comes to a point where you're a fool if you go there.
Good old MAGA Fox idiot interviewer, claims "previous administration" had higher prices than we get in this idiocracy of Trump and MAGA morons. Is she interviewing for a cabinet position?
I'd never give a penny to Disney lol
Maybe they are trying to recoup the losses from Snow White! 🤮
Disney sucks...
Ive never been and couldnt care less about Disney but this guy doesnt know how to research prices? Hes at fault here. Anyone with a brain knows Disney is expensive.
They lost me at 30  dollar parking why in bloody  hell would u pay for this weirdness
What I always say when talking about Disney is “ Disney is Great at Separating you from your Money “.
Walt Disney was a Mason. All of this is evil shrouded in a family good time. It isn't. Like Christmas. It leaves you broke and deflated - which is their purpose.
Disney is smarter than the MAGA base ..... complain and pay ... pretend it's Trump merch
What do you expect? It’s Disney. So many dumb Americans thinking everything is owed to them somehow. Super Narcissistic dad too
2:52 meanwhile it cost 20 bucks online
So just avoid all the tariff related ACTUAL inflation, Fox News wants to play in its dumb viewers faces with this mess. 😂😂😂. And look at y’all eat it up.
Another issue is the continued high attendance. Disney has successfully captured the hearts and minds of children, creating a perceived necessity to visit for their sake. Making parents pay any cost.
Bru that’s chump change.. stop complaining and not go so I can go an not be crowded with people who complain..
When Disney started grooming children, I stopped supporting their evil empire
Bro wearing the ears!!!! 😂😂😂
My grandparents took my parents and me to Disney in the late 70s or early 80s. I think it might have been ‘79 or ‘80 because I look about 3-4 in the pictures. My grandfather was a mail sorter at the post office and my grandmother was a housewife. Somehow they afforded the trip with no problem. The greed of Disney these days is exactly why I haven’t taken my kids. Maybe if they ASKED to go I might, but since it wasn’t something they ever really wanted to do I didn’t see a need to spend that kind of money on it. We’ve had lots of family trips to Florida, Tennessee, the Carolinas, etc. Lots of fun and memories. And so much more affordable.
It’s gotten a bit better….really FOX.
Wow. Had to insert politics into the story. Tacky
You all just hate Disney because you think they shouldn’t have brown people in movies. Just own your racism!
I drove with my wife and 2 kids from Edmonton, Canada to Anaheim, California and took them to Disney.  NEVER AGAIN !!!!!!!!  It was the most expensive vacation we have ever taken.  The lineups were so long. The people were bumping into us all the time and no one apologized.  My wife and I had an argument in the middle of Disney because we went to buy 4 hotdogs and 4 soft drinks and the vendor wanted over $80 American which would have been around $100 Canadian. I straight refused to pay that for hotdogs and my wife got mad  at me because I embarrassed her. lol.  I will never take my kids on any other Disney vacation again I know that. I would rather burn my money instead.
Spending $1400 for a day is insane and he needs to have his head examined. We stopped going 2011 when ticket prices were $90/ person. You don’t the have to go.
I can only imagine. I would like to take my grands..🙄😩
I dont like amusement parks for rhis reason.
Was checking prices for a family trip 2026. Heck no! There are other ways to spend that kind of money to spend the day in a long line. Would rather spend time and money enjoying the day.
That’s a once in a lifetime trip. There are a million ways to save on a trip like this. If you can’t afford don’t go! It costs a lot of money to create the experience for you! If you aren’t maga California weather is better! You should know what the cost is before you go! Quit complaining!
Grew up in Florida not worth it we never went and I have nine children with my husband we never took them so proud of us 😊 sounds like dad paid a bunch of money so they could have a nice talk there’s a big clue there huh?
Absolutely ridiculous, that Disney can charge such extortionate amount
That’s not a lot of money for your Brady brunch dude
Should of just went to six flags way better
I would avoid that place at any cost , not a penny !
Bro this ain’t news. Everyone knows this the only dummies that don’t have never been. Disneyland or world isn’t worth it.
No thank you
That’s not even a months salary for a majority of families. I can make that in a week but I’m definitely not spending it on Disney. I refuse to support that.
Unbelievable how expensive it is, and families KEEP PAYING!  And the parks are packed!!  90 minutes to get on one ride. Millions have turned away, and yet, millions still go. It makes no sense.
It is very pricey
That place is theworse place om earth too take any one, such a scam.
doling out woke indoctrination costs money. they lost their mission.
Total rip-off
No flipping way!
The way Disney is set up now, with the exorbitant pricing, and their hypocritical political stances, you need to ingrain in children at a very young age that their properties are a no go. That starts with, of course, the parks, but, the modern Disney productions. Both in the theaters and on television. There are tons of other things that little girls and little boys can enjoy. Also, interviewing the little girl to see if it was worth it is crazy! She has no idea what money is. My son is 15, and only now starting to grasp things, because he has his first job.
Can't stop winning
Overpriced . I would never waste my money on Disney.
Unreal WOW 🙀 I'm not supporting this park,is over price
that's why you check prices BEFORE you go... and then you are smart enough to NOT GO because the prices are ridiculous... Simple...
Disney is horrible anymore!!!!
This is what we get under the Trump administration.
Sorry but things have not gotten better..I live in FL and we all know Disney is over priced.. if you can afford to splurge then fine, otherwise expect to pay way more than you wanted to
My boss went every year,  He spared no expense  One year it rained so hard they didn't go to Disney but paid $15,000 for the week.
Money is at the job if you are able bodied
I’ve never been to Disney and I have no regrets
👀🤣😂😅😭😭👎🏾 I guess my kids are never going to Disney world!!! 🤷🏾‍♂️😭
$44 for a lightsaber! The cost on that is likely no more than $5. Corporate Greed INDEED!
It's the childless Disney adult bloggers that keep them going. 😂
Under the last administration? 😮 Under the current one! You have to blame Trump!
I spend around $1500 for family of 5 in a month spending groceries. I am struggling.
What about the wife ? Why wasn’t she helping with the bill
That's crazy stuff
I would never spend that kind of money !!! There are  better way to spend your money !!!
Fox News is brain dead. It’s actually worst now than it was during the last administration. How has it gotten better? Truly fake news. Carry on…
It is called a once in a life only Take your children to national monuments. Visit historical places.  It's cheaper, learn about American history  and a lot cheaper
It’s not unusual for concerts to cost $200-400 per person.  For 1-2 hrs.  So compare that to multiple hours with a seven people.  That’s a large family.
They support abortion which makes no sense because there killing off their future clients. Go figure.
He's a dumbass for spending that kind of money.
Don’t go to Disney. Get a good manufacturing job and help America! Disney is for the rich.
OUTRAGEOUS😳
I wouldn't go if it weren't for my son with autism.  I go because it's important to him.  But it makes me want to vomit just thinking about it.
Wow...5 kids and he is crying .....$945 fair
No it hasn’t got better than when Biden was in stop slagging off Bidem
My Disney trip cost me 5k smh
College fund, or trip to Disney world!  I’ll go with the college fund.
Buy plane ticket online to get a call for 25$ inflation must be payed after already paying before flying. Any trip to anywhere..interesting  huh😮
If you can’t afford it don’t go. Why complain? Seems selfish to me.
Hearing that daughter's answer made it all worth it
I took my son to Disney and I thought the prices were acceptable…I don’t even wanna see the prices now!!!💯👀
That price aligns with inflation. It's the paycheck that's not keeping up.
You won't catch me anywhere near  that hell hole.
Disney gives you fun. You give Disney $. What could go wrong?
Florida is such a beautiful place to vacation in there is so much more than a Disney
Love how he's a Representative for Disney and against trump inflation. 👏👏👏👏
I'm relieved that my kids are now teenagers and have outgrown Disney. We've visited the parks several times over the years, and we've seen a steady increase in prices across the board—from tickets to food and souvenirs. When we first went in 2016, it felt more affordable, but by the time we returned last year, the overall cost had nearly doubled.
People don’t want to do without.  So, they will pay anything.  Vote with your wallets folks
Why the anchor has to bring up the GROCERIES and GASOLINE here???? Clear propaganda for MAGA crowd. Why didn't she mention about OTHER things becoming pricy?? She even didn't say that groceries still costing much!!
Trumps amazing America
And If you want to blow your brains out just book a weekend to stay on the inside the parks Disney hotels,yo will spend at least 10k in one weekend with a family of 4,and the “lightning pass” “express-pass” still you have to do a looooong line,I bit faster than the regular line but for what you pay still super slow,what used to be a vacation destination for working families has become a luxury for sure.
I go with my wife we spend a third of that.. lose the kids..
Yea, Disney is not what you used to be in so many ways.
Young lady wouldn’t humiliate herself with those mini ears so dad stepped up…. 🤡
Disney always been expensive tf they talking about 😂
Don’t make so many babies if you can’t afford them man
Woke Disney like so many other radical progressive communist thinking places are way out of line in cost's. If the public just stops acquiescing to there crazy pricing and move on then maybe it will hamper their outrageous pricing! Wake up people there are other places and activities to enjoy as a family then to succumb to social pressure that your kids need to experience.
I bet this family will be reimbursed and sent back on a free family trip hey they might even get a 1 million go fund me for this
DEI Disney sux
And yet it was “Packed” 🤦🏻‍♀️
The flip side is, if it was cheap to enter, imagine the class of people that would be there.
Americans are lazy and cheap. You dont work 16 hours, and I wonder y your poor stop complaining because you can afford it.    Lmao, im kidding 😂
No Disneyworld and no 90,000 dollar pickup trucks. Americans need to quit squandering their money .
Condoms are a lot cheaper, should’ve known better than to bring your kids to Disney.
I recently took the family to Disneyland. The wife and I split it down the middle so she could feel the burn too. Things could have easily gotten out of hand if I was the only ATM.   Also glad to hear my kids are normal, I guess. I thought something was wrong with them for fighting in the middle of the happiest place on Earth.
Yet the park is still full everyday
Suckers!! DON'T PAY!!!
What a total moron. His business will go under soon. Poor financial literacy.
Always blaming Biden administration, obsessively. Inflation, costs. Trump is your savior.
Have zero issues with the pricing.  The parks are nice, and the pricing keeps the capacity lower so you don't have to wait in lines as long. Can bring your own food and drinks, if you want to save on expenses.
We need more videos like this, but just show us the cost of trumps tariffs
I'm not sure why anyone here is surprised or upset. It's the free market, they can charge whatever they want, it's private property. But I'm sure it's all Biden and Obama's fault.
Disney is a money-sucking monster 👿 my family went once many years ago. Won’t go again.
I held my breath and did it once for my children. Overpriced, hours in lines.. not worth it
Supply and demand more demand higher prices besides disney destroys Children.
People are just discovering Disney prices just now?
Why not talk about this administration? It’s been over 100 days, stop spiking y’all’s coffee in the morning and wake up💯
black hole of disney
I do not have a spouse or children yet. I would never go to Disney without a family because Disney is for kids. Not adults. I am over 40.
It's people's fault that's why i stop going it's outrageous!
The long lines for everything is an indication that everybody is fine with the prices! My kids and i opt for the North Georgia moutains and will hit up Helen for a tourist trap experience.  Way cheeper and a lot mor fun!!
I went to Disney when I was 9 and when I was 11, the 2nd time I was over it. Universal studios was a bit cooler bc it was more of a show than just rides. Even being in it's a small world was uncomfortable as a kid too. If I were to go to another park, 6 flags seems a lot more fun.
oooooo fox. i heard that slip up about people not affording groceries. trump is gonna bark at your fake news org.
Nope can't do it no matter what.  Disney done lost their minds. And paying  worker such low play😢
Just Stop Going To Disney
Park is still packed.
that had to be for season passes or all parks plus skipping ahead. i spent 5k at disney some years back.i have no regrets.
The shallowest place on earth.
I went to animal kingdom last month with my wife and 2 kids. literally way too expensive and the lines basically takes up to an hour for a 2 minute ride’ which kills your day. And lightning passes priced for another arm and a leg!  Overall not worth it at all!  I Spent over a $1000 for a mediocre experience. The best part was when we left!  Never again!
Easy. Come to Disneyland Paris. Way less expensive than in the US.
I went to Disney on Someone else's dime. 1998 and it was not a fun. Place.  Vegas is more fun even if you can't gamble.
I don’t like the news lady. She just doesn’t feel genuine. Like a robot
Don't go there and then complain. I would NEVER go there and waste all that money.
Boycott this greedy crap.
Let them all go broke.
😂😂😂 idk about yall but have you been on a trip and paid for a cheap hotel? Have you noticed all the farm Animals  and low lifez of people that you see there? Same logic to everything you pay for. Have you noticed why that home is 200k? And the one 30 mins away is 600k? Because you prolly don’t want to get shot by Tyrone. Now use that logic for everything that you pay besides the food at groceries 😂😂 come on people too many sheeps in the world. “ well 100 years ago this was like 4$”  gotta love those comments it’s supply and demand and for the experience. If you got it you won’t have an issue with it. Because if this was say 5-10$ a ticket I mean if you use one brain cell do u know the whole country that has kids would be there and you would not be able to move in there.
he is contradicting himself- says "we are all trying to pinch pennies" Obviously for him thats not the truth
Disney is totally not worth that kind of money the place is run down workers are under paid and on top of that when you walk up to an attraction it's brought to you by a big corporation that there getting additional money from!!!!!!
And I thought pro sports tickets/food/parking was a real rip off.  This is something.  Maybe Desanctimonious should put Disney out of business.
Capitalism; suck it up. That is not bad for 5 people. I paid  $1474.00 (no tip included) on a dinner in Peru. You pay for the experience.
And he didn’t need to buy plane tickets from another country…
So sad.  These prices are ridiculous!
This woman is full of crap “under the last administration but it’s gotten better” ?? How do you say these things with a straight face?  demon is what you are 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
National parks >
Price and Demand .
Why is Fox News crying? This is capitalism!
“Under the last administration”
Nature Park is way more Better than Man made Park.
Keep your money. I’ll just go to an Amusement Park nearby.
Mouse trap set for human 😂
Have you tried buying food lately? Is this a distraction to take away our attention from the fact we can't afford to eat?
$1,400 I have NEVER heard of a theme park charging that much for a single day of experience!  *Even for 5-10 people at once that price is still a ripoff!*
That is cheap compared to the $600 entrance fee I got charged for a group of 3 at the one in California. This was about 3 yrs ago and doesn't include parking.
For over half of Americans this is cheap. It’s the lower half that is out of luck. And the cheaper your income the more you’re forced to live in a dried wasteland in the ghetto.   As what most Americans accuse you of!!!  It’s all your fault!   If you want to make more than you better go out and make more.   You’re not thinking positive and you brought this trouble on to yourself and your family.   I am better than you because my wealthy family helped me through college and I did it all by myself.   If you want to be like me then you better work harder like me because anyone can do it. You’re just making excuses for yourself.   You are not trusting in god. God gave me all of these opportunities and I prayed to Jesus and they gave me everything and you are not praying enough.   I am your CEO and my family helped me to become your Boss. I am now your god and you have to do everything I say.   Good luck trying to get another Boss because they are all just like me. Now mop my floors and clean my toilets.   Most CEO’s don’t care about your life or your children and always put their children above yours. They will dominate and control you and replace you when you’re all worn out.   The ones on Top never have to work a day in their lives and own the businesses that get paid to run themselves as they use their money for investing in royalties investments. They are not only covered for life but their children’s children’s  children will never have to work a day in their lives.
I went once. Smelled like sweaty bodies and exploitation
We blame trump
Omg and this is in US Dollars! As an Aussie after exchange this would cost $2560!
Her slipping in the lie that it’s “gotten better” under Trump was hilarious lol
What’s the point of going there, knowing the prices and complain about it.   Going to Disney is not mandatory, if you can’t afford it, don’t go, simple as that!
It has not gotten a little bit better
You’re a horrible news person to even mention the last administration while this hard working American was not happy about paying that much money to go to Disney land so how long will yall keep trying to blame everything on the last administration hell people can’t afford nothing now so who’s fault is that going to be a year or two later the last administration wow
My kids have to wait until they become adults to go to Disney.
One of the biggest SCAM in the world. Putting high prices that is extremely over than it really cost..
White people needs to stop going to disney just for bragging rights ....when you can go to pigeon forge or dolly world which is much better
He should've done research before going..
...And its a disgraceful thing when underpaid low wage Disney employees can't even afford to go to work. Greed, Greed, Greed
This is not news 😂😂😂
The gap between the haves and have-nots only widens. Maybe we'll get Circus World back.
If you budget right it’s not pocket breaking, I took my 3 kids myself and their dad to 2 parks and it cost us about 2500
What would Walt Disney say?
Simple, if you can't afford it don't go. Is that too tough for the magats to understand?
I went once. It was fun. But never again
I couldn’t afforded Disney when my two kids were little as a single mom.  So two years ago they decided to go to Disney together, they’re both nurses, making decent money. After two days’s trip they said it was their first and last to Disney. It’s way too Expensive!
Disney is not for everyone,, Mikey Mouse pay taxes as well!😂😂😂
Just say you’re broke if $1.3k is too much for you 🤷🏼‍♀️
Mickey took your brown eye cause you did not sacrifice a child  before you went in ! 🤣🇺🇸🤙🏻
That us just crazy, US prices are not welcome for tourists and locals. So glad I live in EU.
Disney is big corporate machine and also a bit greedy if you ask me.
That meanwhile swipe the card all me can relate lol 😆
I don't go to these parks anymore because they're too crowded. But why did people decide to go and complain that it was too expensive? Don't you try to do some research to at least know how much it will cost you? Information about the cost is everywhere on the internet.
If you cannot afford it stay home. Simple.  Why cry about it? Get a third or fourth job so you can have more money and stop being lazy.
Fuk Disney 🎉
I went a month ago So nice no lines no nothing 😊
Go to church! Their no fees there 🙏🏽
Or you can go to cedar point, and you'll spend a fraction, ride almost  everything, have way more fun, and your children wont be somewhere where the chances of them being taken and traffic skyrocket.
That's the price for a Florida resident? Imagine the cost if you have to fly and stay in a hotel there.  Sickening.
It was once for kids and parents to enjoy themselves. It is now for kids and oarents to brain wash themselves and pay a ton of money to do. We went for 1 week and it cost us 8 grand. Thats 2 months of pay. That was also with us pinching every penny we could.
I live two hours from Disney and I haven't been there in over a decade.
Fail.  Vote with your wallet people!  Don’t go.  Don’t pay those outrageous prices.  But people will go no matter what. So they will keep raising the price,  no matter what.
Disney is disgusting
as a Brit we gor rinsed ....so pricey .... my first trip to Disney and I wasnt impressed by the pricing ......hot as well yet $3 for water what a joke  $12 for a dry hotdog and crap chips
just go to a six flags, total will most likely be under $500 if you don't pay for the scammy vendors and if it's a big park it'll be just as much fun
I watched a documentary YouTube a few years back about a family living in a cheap motel and the father was employed there. They charge all that money and pay many of their employees poverty wages while selling us souvenirs made by child labor in China. Disney is literally the symbol of evil greed.
Disney has always been expensive.  Nothing new
My parents never took me places like that and I grew up happy, finished school, got a job and now have my own family.
Grew up in Orlando. Would never go to Disney again. Not worth it
If I never do Disney again, that will be fine with me.
How about going camping ?? Taking a car ride somewhere.
Or you can go to Efteling the most beautiful fairytale park in the world, twice the size of Disneyland and 48euro per person 😀 owned by a non profit organization.
Disney is a waste of time they're ripping people off. Wake up, people stop wasting your money and time period
LIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I LITERALLY CANT RN 😂😂😂😂😂😂
It’s not what it used to be. I went a few times when I was a kid and unfortunately my kids will not be able to go. I refuse to pay those prices. It’s just greedy at this point. We went to The American Dream instead. It’s an indoor Nickelodeon theme park and water park. Much cheaper and just as fun.
I gave up on Disney a long time ago!
You’re feeding the beast….no thanks
Capitalists ...
Universal is the best
Paying for temporary happiness
That is insane! You can literally buy an all inclusive trip to Cancun at the nicest resort for that much
Yep won't ever go back there not only that wait in line for hours and pay for it. Hard pass now
That was the past administration lmao bimbo barbie reading and listening to her earpiece 🐏🐑🐏
Don't forget the long lines
I saw a bottle of Dom Perignon for $350 and Caviar $150 for 28 grams.  Madness!  I had a cheese burger and a Coke.  Perfect!
I would never take my kids to Disney. It’s like going to downtown LA.
Seriously. I would not bother 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Expensive 🤪
In other news, water is wet. You don't go to disney unless you are willing to mortgage your house for a couple of days of...whatever it is they do.
It's an experience. A life experience. The kids will always remember it. That's priceless.
The cost of running a park that size with all the maintenance, huge number of employees, electricity, security, etc. is enormous. As cost go up, so must their ticket prices. Disney Land was never a cheap vacation destination. I didn't go as a child because it was simply out of reach for my family. It was never meant to be a right of passage that everyone must be able to go to. Sorry, that is the hard reality.
Long time Florida resident, it's always been an inside joke,the stupid tourist that spends so much at the resorts. Residents of Florida never patronize these rip off tourist traps. Disney is a woke Chinese disaster.
A grown man sporting Mickey Mouse ears. You need help
This is why my children have not been indoctrinated by Disney woke B.S. he doesn’t even know Disney world exists & we took him to six flags.
Lol this lady said people were struggling under the last administration yall are delusional
1400 oh big deal... im paying 1200 to go GLAMPING. GLAMPING!!!!. for 3 people. here in Tofino Canada
Walt Disney’s slogan for Disney World from 1970-2000: “The Happiest/Most Magical Place on Earth.”  Bob Iger’s slogan for Disney World from 2000 - Present: “The Most Inclusive/Expensive Place on Earth.”
I remember many years ago at Disney I bought a bottle of water that was outrageous. And everything else was very expensive. It is a bad place in my opinion.
Disney is overhyped....yes, I said it....and Ive been going to Disney since I was a child.
That price is actually about right... it's about the same back in the 90's with inflation.  Disney and similar luxury destinations are not meant to be affordable they are in the business of making money.  They only way those types of places will bring their prices down is if people stop going and not pay. Though we know that's not happening, no matter how far outside someone's budget may be people still scrap by to go there only to complain about it afterwards with buyer's remorse.
F disney
I wouldn't do ANYTHING Disney even if it was free!
Why wear the ears after being ripped off? I don't feel sorry for them.
All to go spend money for  the company that held the biggest chomos gatherings behind closed doors. Thats crazy i would never!!!!!!! And we grew  up in San Diego.  Now we live in the Natural  State Arkansas , we rather go hiking and enjoy mother nature
Europe is garbage now! Only terrorists and pickpockets everywhere. I like USA theme parks and nature outdoors. USA is amazing.
F disney!!! They are whats wrong with our country, corporate greed!!!!
OMFG FOX AT LEAST TELL THE TRUTH..UNDER BIDEN AT LEAST PEOPLE COULD BUY FOOD AND NOW WITH TRAITORS TRUMPS TARIFFS IN 2 WEEKS TIME SHELVES ACCORDING TO SUPERMARKET CEO,S ARE GOING TO BE EMPTY..YOUR NIGHTMARE IS JUST BEGINNING MAGA,AND BOY ARE YOU GOING TO SUFFER..BUT THE CORRUPT,VILE,LYING,EVIL FOX HOSTS WON,T TELL YOU THAT EH?
Why is anyone still watching FOX?
OMG THAT,S JUST PLAIN EXTORTION!!
The magic is gone... NEVER Disney....        No Real Value there...
Wait until he sees the mustachioed princesses
Going to Disney becoming joke... it's called 1400$ long walk, get tired and go to hotel for sleep... what a joke 🤣
Well somebody’s paying for it smh
People need to unite and just stop going. If people stop then they either have to lower the price or close. If you keep going they will keep making increases and charge outrageous prices. I’d rather set fire to my money than pay these prices.
😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤REDECLUES
Why not just go on holiday to Europe and see something interesting lol
A MONTHS RENT...or just 1 day at Disney 🤔. A MONTHS GROCERIES🤨...a day at Disney 😡 ECT ECT.ect
The last administration…orange man, hold my beer…
NOT A MICKEY MOUSE OPERATION .Stopped going to theme parks when they got so expensive .
Really. Someone is clueless about a visit to a Disney park being so expensive. No one could be this stupid. He must have done this deliberately to prove a point. If so were the case, he did the right thing.
Shameful. Disney could easily make up that money with lower prices and more park visitors. Sure seems like they are trying to price people out and get the most money out of the least effort. Disgusting.
Whats New?  Bowie told us 50 years ago "  It's on America's tortured brow That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow" !
I live in the Philippines and $1,400 could pay my rent for over a year and a vacation.
All I see is acute materialism...
Nutz
Disney movies bomb so they overcharge for the park
Im going try really hard to never go.
Soon you won’t even be able to afford it, why bother go?
not worth the money, waiting in line all the time
If people would quit paying the high prices they would be forced to lower them.
Everyone Boycott
No sympathy for this man. He willingly funding a theme park, movie studio, streaming channel, etc  that is pushing an agenda that is ruining our society.
8 men who arent immortal or godlike. But.......just like us.   Mortal. Do you understand the real messsage?   We are.....equal. yes equal. Very equal...
“With the last administration” oh boy. 🤣🤣🤣
Employees salary going down but corporate profits going up along with CEOs , all corporate pointing inflation for their pricing,  what a greedy world 🤫
Idk I feel like Disney needs to update their attractions….i went to Disney and Epcot in December and the balance for me and babe was around $3000+ lmaoo… food (that’s not even all that great) goodies from shops….we don’t have kids and that was the price..thousands for 2 days at the parks…idk… i feel like dad did good 😂
I found that you pay all that money just to stand in queues most of the day....never again!
Twice I have been to Angel Falls (The world's highest single drop falls at 969m) in Canaima National Park in Venezuela. The last time was in 2015. The package, inclusive of a 45 minute return flight from the city Puerto Ordaz, a two night stay, meals, a tour of nearby giant waterfalls, with a trip with overnighting to Angel Falls was around US$550. More foreigners have seen Angel Falls than the locals. as it is simply unaffordable for Venezuelans ! Trinidad & Tobago. West Indies.
"Father shocked by cost of Disney.....but pays anyway leading people with common sense to say he is not in shock. Just a drama queen"   😅😂
If its already packed at that cost, it might even be more packed if the prices were cheaper.
They gotta recover their movie losses somehow...
The land of fee 😂
Folks love capitalism 😂
We lived in Anaheim during the 60’s and could see the fireworks in the sky from our house. We never went to the park even once, because it was too expensive. And that was when a family of four could probably go for about 40-50 dollars, food included. So, nothing has changed!
Idiot people.  As long as you keep paying to they will keep gouging you.
Should have gone to Universal!!
😂   cheap cheap cheap  says a little birdy 😅
Next time buy a trump coin😂😂
PRESIDEMT DONALD PUTIN.....MAGA YOU DID IT,....RACIST FOOLS
Just shows how stupid people who like Disney crap are. I'm surprised they dont charge the idiots more.
$44.99 for a life saber is CRAZY.
Some of her questions are oddly worded.
I paid $13,000 for a week. He made out pretty good!
Cant blame biden for that trump has had 100 days the house and senate came in signing things day one thats not bidens doing. Im out of excuses this is not a cult cult isn't paying my f ing bills!!!
THAT SHOULDN'T COST 1400$  FOR 1 DAY. You can only ride 3 rides in one day.  You have to take 4 days to get to ride on the rides and see everything. IT SHOULDN'T COST THIS MUCH.
$200 per person. That's not so bad! Fl residents use to pay $65 per person Disney passes back in the 90's. I'm glad Disney is going greedy. Making Walt roll in his grave don't it?
You might enjoy your wife getting boinked by doink the clown instead for less.
Next time go to France 😉
Biggest tourist trap in the nation.
My niece wants to go to Universal Studios, so I purchased tickets last night. Paid $1,500 just for the tickets to walk in.
Let me guess......its all Trumps fault 😂 you no, "orange man bad" 😅
Let’s call the governor he can lower the price
HAVING FUN IS IRRELEVANT.
Going to any Disney theme park is so not worth it anymore. Too expensive, & too crowded.
Greedy folks 😢😢😢
OUTRAGEOUS
Why would you even support Disney
Welcome to Trumps America  High grocery cost High Rent  High healthcare High student loans  Deporting AMERICAN PEOPLE  Are we great yet?
Disneyland is overrated. Not the happiest place on earth anymore
Everybody talks about Disney  World but i've never had a desire to go to Disney, a lot of wasted money. of course different strokes for different folks,
Lmao who cares why eould u go to woke disney this aint news be better fox wow
Disney trip epitomize what is wrong with America
I agree I went to Disney World and Universal and I spent like 10 grand with food Airbnb flight. Was it worth it? Yes or no for the kids but for the adult and normal class people is definitely not worth it. Save your money go somewhere else Disney World do not give a damnabout broke people or middle class cause there’s no such thing anymore.
We went in 2021, only because the lines were a little shorter. But it was an expensive and unejoyable as I thought it would be. Back then it was about 600 for the ticket for a family of 4. Mostly we waiting in line. Even one ride broke down just as we got to the front of the line and it was too bad so sad. They didn’t even attempt to compensate people who waited all that time. They have nothing but contempt for the people who would spend over a thousand dollars to wait in line form3/4 of your day. Worst value out there.
Beta Bucks lol
This man is a saint a good father doing anything for his family's happiness💝  @Disney is about one thing: money. They appear to be all about their guests but really don't care about affordability, treating/paying its employees a living wage all they care about is their public reputation as it pertains to asset losses. Maximizing dividends and profits through any means.
so if people just boycott them, they will have to think about what they are doing. Hard working parent shouldnt have to pay $1400 for one day of fun..
Quite simply, if you can’t afford it then don’t go. Obviously, many people CAN afford to go because the lines are long. It’s time to stop being shocked and face reality
As an 80s/90s kid, I grew up with Disney, almost becoming a traditional animator so I could work there. It’s disgusting how greedy & woke this company has become. I remember when parking was free and fast pass was in full force..you were able to get so much more for your ticket price. I’ve been lucky enough to go to the parks many, many times during the late 90s/2000s. I will always love/respect the history, imagineering, and artwork of the parks (in particularly the brilliant Haunted Mansion), but it will be a long time before I give Disney any of my money ever again.
When China owns 47% of Disney. What did yall think was gonna happen. Prices go down. Lol 😂😂😂  Wake up people
That place ain't nothing but a money pit go to Fun Spot its free to go in just have to pay for food and drinks
this is where hapiness stops
Stop funding the war in Ukraine and redirect it to welfare of the people
Stop paying it!
What can one anticipate? They must generate revenue in some way due to Snow White.
Buying a single day ticket (on the same day of entry) is the most expensive possible way of doing it.   Our holiday last year worked out €65 per day each. I admit the parking charge is ridiculous though. However, you can avoid that by parking at Disney Springs for free and taking the free shuttle bus to the park.   For this dad, that would have been a smart move as he was going to Springs in the evening anyway!  I’m not sure why $245 for an evening meal for 5 people in a restaurant was that surprising. That just seems to be the cost of having a large family 🤷🏻‍♀️   Personally, I do a big breakfast before heading to the park and eat light on the park. Iced water is free at any eatery, you only need to ask for it. Grab a $12 hotdog or an ice cream for lunch.   My point is, it can totally still be financially feasible if you think a bit in advance. Otherwise you’ll end up on the pricey conveyor belt!
We've never been
Yes it’s 100% rip off       For a one off people might think it’s ok only works out £200 per person but for all the queing ect doesn’t justify the price
So obvious, it could be an Onion headline.
SUCK IT UP!  YOU VOTED FOR THE BUFFOON CULT LEADER TRUMP!!!!😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉
Fox will pay for the trip!  Fox likes paying out millions in fines for lying!!!
2:15 - So the reporter blames the last administration on prices and says "it has gotten a bit better".  Is she blind and stupid?  Grocery prices are getting worst by the day.  We can literally track products on Amazon and literally see that prices going up.  Many major US corporations have announced that prices will be going up.  The ports of L.A. and Long Beach are stating 35% less volume, that means reduced supply.  So there is NOTHING getting better.
Remember when Disney tickets were $20 in the 1970’s.
OMG... under the LAST admin.  Get a reality check woman.
Only suckers go to disney.
I never understood the dollar-store quality toys for $40+... And this goes for Disney On Ice and other Disney events as well. With what they're making from ticket and food sales, you'd think they could sacrifice/offer one (free) toy per child upon entry.
What’s Disney?!
You take the kids a few times to make memories. Then you never go back. Its way over priced.
Theme Park in Indonesia (called : Dufan (Dunia Fantasi) meaning Fantasy World) cost you $13 per ticket for all rides i believes, of course not really big as Disney World, but i think for just fun is worth it...
Place is a rip off for years but you rich clowns keep paying the price so they keep the prices up.
For 5 people though. It can’t be that shocking.
Disneyland is not family friendly ever since 1998-2005 All they really care for is your money but hey ppl will never understand.
1400 dollars!? That's more than i pay for week in the Mediterranean 😮
Why isn’t Fox News calling him out for not doing enough research before the trip?
I won't waste my money at Disney
Well they have to make up the three hundred million they lost because of zegler and their dei woke mindset
They extract every dollar they can from the American Paying Families , Couples & Single People as well they are mining for Gold and Striking It Rich.
The audacity to blame the prevouis administration again. 🙄
From the UK  A week long holiday with Disney costs upwards of 10k.  Whilst it is every kids dream, its a nightmare for the parents!
We come over on average every other year, next years trip is £5300 for our flights and accommodation, our tickets are £1850 and we try to save up about £3000-3500 for spending money which gives us a daily spend of around £230-260 ish on our food , drink snacks etc, we catch a bus to London from where we live in wales £160 return, and our transfers state side and travel for our 2 weeks are around £500. We work multiple jobs between us, 5 jobs was the most, now we are down to 3 jobs. And it costs us around £10000-11000 each trip. 😢🤷🏼‍♂️🙏🏽🇺🇸🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
I worked in a couple of parks in Orlando. Eventually I stopped going cause it got boring after a year, but it could be different for others. Disney is overrated. Once in my life was enough for me, until the day I started working there.
Mad props to this family going viral.
lol 😂
That's actually crazy
So many people leave the resort frustrated.  Its not worth the money. Long lines over and over all day and night. 0 stars for Disney Corp
maybe the father should look for a better job
Chile we will just continue to watch the movies…f a park! 😩😂😭
Chile we will just continue to watch the movies…f a park! 😩😂😭
They need to make some money. Remember, Snow White flopped so hard.
You don’t go for a day unless you are a local (whom get discounts) We went for 2 weeks last year and flights, food, accommodation, parks close to 600 per day (still a lot of money) but changes picture with accommodation and flights and longevity of stay
Hey thats CRAIG?! Ace car salesman!!!! YouTube FLYING WHEELS!!!!!!!!!
The first time I went to Disneyland was in 1964. I believe it cost about six dollars for the tickets and to get in there wasn’t more than four or 500 people in the park the whole day you never had to wait for a ride they were just standing there waiting for you to come up so they had something to do. It was so wonderful back in those days anyone could afford to go to Disneyland. I couldn’t even afford to park there now.
Her answer at the end was so heartwarming and actually so real.  Because you want your parents to do what you want, but you want them to do it with you. So you REALLY want to go to Disney, but in the end, what you like and remember is that THEY went and did it together with you.
In Tokyo Japan  the tickets for kids are about $36 and adults about $68. Disney Land and there is also Disney Sea next to it. I took a date there and it wasnt expensive. Long lines though.
Went last October, based on the other theme parks I would say Disney does give better value for money “food wise” in the quality and quantity of their food is far better than Universals offerings and massively better than SeaWorld/Busch Gardens, but at all the parks there are so many little add ons to pay to make your experience better and they are not worth it at all, $30+ to park anywhere, why ? When you are paying park tickets anyway, I know it’s always been there but I have never got that, every year it rises, like the cost of the park tickets, pay $50+ to park closer to the park and you get there and it’s about 100 yards closer than the other car park you would have been in anyway (don’t bother).
Duh!
Why is Brian suicidal at the end of…
Going WokeWorld is going brokeworld…. Duhhhh
Dad resembles Ron Desantis 🤣
I grew up near Disneyland (in CA) and as kids, we would visit the park many times throughout the year.  It really is a shame that many kids will not be able to enjoy Disneyland/World anymore.
Trump did that.
I would not go even if it was for free, the named of Disney is stained and shamed from WOKE perversion and demonic spirits.
You'd think with what they charge they could at least pay their employess a livable wage
Paying 300 for parking is the patriotic American thing to do. Only radical leftist communists will demand cheap public transport
Since they went woke and broke, I will not buy anything from Disney , the company is not what Walt Disney dreamed of
As Canadians Disney World was always a favourite vacation spot.  With the increased costs of the parks and our Canadian dollar it’s making it impossible for most to ever go to again.
Disney is Done
I thought it was the happiest place on earth. Well I guess not. Lol
Go somewhere else.  Disney is the worst place in North America.
dads an idiot
Rich get richer. Nobody is surprise
Walt Disney is turning in his grave looking at how Disney has become a recruitment center for pedos and its even much worse than that.
Over-Rated, Over-Priced.  There are hundreds of parks that are cheaper and more fun...  Starting with Ohio's Cedar Point
Its very sad that parents don't know the truth about Disney because if they did, they would be calling for a boycott and arrests of Disney pedos.
I think Disney abuses people with there costs to spend the day at the park
Is this performative or did he really not know it's expensive?     People like him will ke err p going, he'll just whine about.  Saying no to his wife is not possible, and he cant teach his kind the value of money and you dont need overpriced trips to be fulfilled.
That's why I'll never go to Disneyland. Not to mention the lines for the rides are a nightmare. You can have it.
In other news, water is wet.
It’s gotten a little bit better?? Lmao she knew she messed it and fix it quick. 😂
It's a scam...
Boycott Disney!!!! So ridiculous! I have gone once. NEVER AGAIN! Not worth it at all.
$1,400 Its nothing, traveling from Asia to America is $100,000. America is poor country.
😂😂🤣 why people still going there ???  They know before they go there that is expensive.
Poor kids can’t even go to Disney Land in California let alone Disney world…This is sad…Do they know how kids want to go but will never go😩😩😩 an they are for the kids🥹
You have to.walk so much and ride lines so long. It's not worth it we had a horrible time. Feet was hurting from all the walking and the sun drained us. We only rode 3 rides 😢
Eat before you go and bring pop tarts (hide in your shirt). Also, KoolAid to mix with the free water from the sink (unless they charge for sink water now). Enjoy! 🤡
Reality check is that you don't have to go somewhere like Disney to have a good time with the fam.  Road trips, camping, hiking, picnics in the park, going to the beach or lake, bike riding, going to a movie theater, attending a museum, eating at your favorite restaurant together, or even board games at home can make for a memorable time.  Just avoid being on your phone!  Like the girl said at the end, it's enjoying time being together that really matters.
lol fox continues to lie come on news lady it hasn't gotten better this new administration has made everything worth off, trump is a failure
TRUE STORY:  The corp execs of Disney were lectured at a meeting some years ago by their boss.  It seems a sizable percentage of Disneyland visitors take out a 2nd mortgage on their house to be able to afford a vacation there.  The lecture was the boss telling his people that he expected them to get that percentage UP.  He told them MORE PEOPLE should be taking out a 2nd mortgage to  take their family to Disneyland for a vacation.  Disgusting, but then nobody ever accused Disney Corp of having ethics.
That’s a-lot of churros. 🍩
Never been to Disney, and I lived 30 minutes away for 11 years now...
I'll stick to six flags
Youll spend most of your money and most of your time in line. Smh theres no fun.
Disney World Orlando is now only realistically for the wealthy.  It was always a real privilege to be able to afford it in the 90s/00s but it was still attainable for a small middle class family, even if it was just a once in a lifetime thing. Now Disney World is really for the upper-middle class, upper class and aristocrats.  That is a real shame.  Some of my happiest memories were at Disney World as a kid, I couldn't justify that kind of money now.  We just go to Paris Disney
Insanity. It used to cost approx 600 USD per day at Disney World for a family of 4. That was for everything including the hotel stay. That was in 1995. Times have changed.
I went to Disney in California in 97. It cost our family 10,000 for a week. Everything was way overpriced. Rhat was nearly 30 years ago.
People should stop paying these rediculous prices these days. If people keep paying with these events, they will keep putting up prices. The Greed must Stop Now... Sydney's Royal Easter Show is a Total ripp of these days with extortunate prices with a family day ticket + Plus those little Extras      😮 Au
I will not spend that much on WOKE disney.
Don’t go out brokie.
Did someone notice the Trump propaganda channel saying that cost of living have slightly improved since the last administration "but things have slightly improved"?  As for Disney, you all live in the United Corporations of America and they want more more more untill there is nothing left for the average person. Greed at it's finest.
Small tip, look into the events like after hours, the Christmas one and fhe Halloween one. They are way more worth it in my opinion and ALOT less people. Plus they include all you can eat and drink items like popcorn, ice cream and 20oz soda/water.
Soooo outrageously expensive, Yet the park is still packed. If the ticket is $50 a person, wouldn’t each line be 4 hour wait? Not saying that they should charge so much…. Just for thoughts
Make sandwiches
It is ironic because Disney World wants to be diverse and woke however a large part of that group includes those who can NEVER afford to go there.
disney been doing this for awhile. i WAS a season pass holder at disneyland for 25 years , they treat the locals like crap, disney is woke, it is not the disney i grew up with and the crowds are NOT the same as the past. Turned it in. Then i see what the prices are now for day , what a joke. Go to universal or knotts berry farm. Medieval times and pirate show are great also
why would u spend that at disney...  this is keeping up with the joneses
Terrible host.  Typical al Fox News with swipe at previous administration that was incorrect.  Lame
Of course fox news features cry babies. He's not the first to get got
Yeah it cost our family typically $10,000 or more for 4 of us for a week between Disney, Universal etc.  And sadly yes; you spend so much that you cannot afford to buy a Mickey Mouse Watch.  It's a pricey adventure.  When I was in Grade 11, I booked and organized a bus from Canada with all my friends so they could experience Disney - in the 80's it was affordable and fun.
I always say I'd rater go to the DMV than Disney.  Both are crowded and have lines and costs $, but one is cheaper and you get something done.
They charge what they know people will stupidly pay, if people stop going then the prices come down. I recently went to Tokyo Disneysea in Japan tickets were about $50 and meals $15, it's cheaper because they can't get away with ripping people off there
I mean for real you're just figuring this out now
Yet he's still wearing the Ears...
WE STOPPED GOING AFTER OUR 2016 TRIP! COST US A SMALL FORTUNE!
ngl $1400 is not that much to make your family happy, plus looks like you can afford it...
STOP GOING !!! I wouldn’t dare go. They don’t deserve our money. We need to all stop supporting Disney. They’re not like they use to
WAKT DISNEY IS TURNING IN HIS GRAVE
Groomerland
Chooses to pay 1400 and then complains. Imagine just saying no.
OMG, the absolute fools willingly feeding the money machine to perpetuate its existence??  SMFH…😢
It's sad that Disney parks have become entertainment just for the wealthy. I don't think Walt Disney had that in mind when he first imagined his dream park. I know I can't afford to go anymore, and haven't in over a decade.
if Price = Quality then its not expensive...
Unbelievable …so crazy …💜🇦🇺🦋
Well,.... they need to make money somehow after all the failed live action adaptations lol
First time?
That’s the price of my mortgage!
So fun getting scammed and waiting in line. Yay.
Vote with ur wallet... but people keep consuming so they will keep charging it...
And we're those suckers that still pay the prices, I'll admit.  The thing with Disney is that they really spare no expense.  Even value resorts feel premium, but if you opt for the yacht club or polynesian, oh boy..
He didnt have to go
Dude is a YouTuber, obviously by the sign and the play button in the back. His viewers, subscribers, paid for your trip. Stop complaining about having to pay when you never had to pay to begin with.
The kid dressing up as Crosshair 🔥
Disney promises a dream for kids but creates a nightmare for parents.
If you are not the target market, why even bother going there? There are other ways of spending good time with your family outdoors.
This guy just wants to be the next big influencer, why did he not just price it out before doing it! I call BS .
Oh but it's for the kids....take them else where...some ppl are just silly sheep Love isnt throwing money at your kids happiness
When a big greedy corporation takes very bad decisions in every business/brand they have and are losing huge pile of money, they will do everything they can to get money from anywhere...so if parks are still attracting people, they will raise the price till everyone alive gives up about them...
The land of the free 😁
Why is she low-key bashing the old administration , stop living in the past! Get ready to pay more with a new tariffs, that this administration. So now regular Americans definitely won’t be able to afford Disney with everything being transported from China. Going to be five times the price.
No inflation in America?
Tr doubling or tripling that if your coming from say Canada. Also, can bring a lunch! And snacks save a lil and buy merch out of say near by stores thats what we did our first time.
Yes that was totally us recently! We almost purchased tickets for a day trip and realized it was going to cost us $650 for three just tickets alone here in California.. we decided to opt out on that. It’s getting ridiculous expensive and with how packed it is now… isn’t worth it 😕
Paid $1,400 to talk to the family 🤭🤣😂🤣🤣🤣😎
No one force him to go. Bring sandwiches 😊
"What was the best part Kendall?" — Kendall: "Ummm ... watching my dad get taken for a ride; and a schmuck!".
My parents always took us off season on a school day so we weren’t waiting in the crazy long lines!
Wow dad, thank you for putting it all out there! Traveled to Disney in 2014 and 2016. Never again in 2025 and beyond! 😉
Disney is dead in my house. My kids know how greedy they are and don’t even want to go to any Disney park. Explain their greed to yours and they won’t want to go either. Let their pockets dry out
"The lines were so long" = economy must be good if there is this much cash flowing for fun.
Geez Louise! I remember the days when my fam, friends & I “used” to pay $120 - $160 for a 5day all you see / ride @Disneyland & Disneyworld….I guess as they say, the good ole days 🤦🏻‍♂️
You are an idiot for going to Disney. Don't spend money there.
Thts cheap compare to Disney Anaheim
DEI recoupment surcharge.
Full sitdown themed dinners are always expensive so kinda your fault tbh and im paying 1245 before the lighting passes to Disneyworld so he had a better deal than i got 😂 and thats before our flights and hotel costs
Disney World exists for doctors who work 60 hrs a week and never see their kids unless they are on vacation.
I can confirm, I just got destroyed last weekend
Get your money up not your funny up broke boy
Did anyone peep how the kids favorite part about Disney was actually waiting in the long lines. Which the dad complained about throughout the whole video. Kids appreciate 1 on 1 time not the trip valuable lessons
Has this guy been living under a rock? It's been expensive for a long time, buddy.
Lol did she say it got alittle better
Disney is still going to have massive lay-offs. I hope this guy has a job that will stand the test of this administration
I went to Disneyland in Aneheim.  I love the high price. I’m Black and the high prices keep the engginers out. Peaceful and fun.  Just save for the trip and get the fast pass watch.
Next time, try a visit to the Efteling, Kaatsheuvel  (NL) this magical theme park is pre Disney and is considered one of the best parks in the world, which it won several times. This family park isn’t owned by a big corporation but by a foundation! So they can keep the prices moderate. It has Rollercoasters, Dark-rides, an enchanted forrest and much more! It’s bigger than Disney seize wise and exploring it all can take several days!  You can stay on site, there are several hotels and accommodations surrounding this park.  An ideal family destination during your holiday.
Yet u dumb enough to pay
Asking the kid was it worth it is stupid. Tell the kid that dad had to work for 3 days to earn the money.  Tell the kid it cost as much as groceries for 3 months. And then ask if it is worth it.
for real? did he not research?
How is he shocked?  He paid for every item in the vacation.
That’s not including any snacks, water, or memorabilia
that $45 light sabre will probably cost $145 in 3 months thanks to tariff
$1500 for a few rides and overpriced average food. No thanks.
The thing is the park was packed,so Disney is loving it. This just goes to show people don’t care about the price.
No worries. Come the ice melts due to global warming, florida will be flooded. Disneyworld will be a writeoff.
Ummmm, if you don't want to pay then DON'T GO.
Hate Disney...never been a fan...ugh.
These people complain about the prices yet they pay it anyway. They even know about it beforehand and still pay like idiots. Disney is making money off of your stupidity. And they will keep doing it cause … *drumroll please* You 👏 Continue 👏 To 👏 Pay 👏 It 👏
They’re trying to rake back money lost on Snow White
You can blame Biden for inflation
Trump is grifting billions  MAGA Manipulating All Gullible Americans
I spent $83 at Disney Hong Kong and had the best time of my life. I didn’t have to wait long lines, I saved money by taking the MTR all the way to Disney Hong Kong. I’ll never ever go to Disney in the U.S. ever again. It’s a scam.
disneyland in CA charges 45$ for parking
"Disney world is not intended for Americans." Bob "The Shyger" Iger
So who cares.  Disney never been cheap so how is this news!! Gtfoh
Fun fact: Disney raises their prices EVERY year. Been doing that for decades. And their recent trend of taking things away confound upon YOU, the customer (no FastPass, no DisneyExpress, etc)
Not worth it considering the lines for the rides are at least 2 hours long.
Losers get a Disney annual pass
What was even worse than the huge expense of a day at Walt Disney World . . . was complaining about how expensive the day was IN FRONT OF YOUR DAUGHTER! Thanks dad for ruining her perception of the 'Magic Kingdom' 😫
You need to teach children that you “just can’t spend that kind of money”.  Teach your kids other values.  That you can go to camping, walking…simple and affordable.  But, you gave in
1 day park ticket = most expensive  Residents or not, this was poorly planned.  WDW is a destination location with the majority of visitors being from out of the state.  If you actually put a value on the time together instead of rides, etc., the price/hour is cheap.    Don’t like it, don’t go.  You got your 5 minutes of fame though.
Please stop going to disney theyre greedy and overpriced.  *Meanwhile i got 4 day tickets with reserved dining and fastpass*
Lmao sooo who forced you?
The dad looks like Ron DeSantis!
Im sure he's gotten way over what he's paid for with all those views
It's already so packed that if they did lower prices, it would be overly packed. Also, I'd rather go to the ocean and just chill.
He should park the car at a hotel or something and uber there 😂😂
Everyone knows Disney is expensive. If you didn’t want to spend money, he should’ve gone somewhere else. Poor kids they have to hear their Dad complain on TV 😮embarrassing 😅 He must be complaining about every Nickel and dime. Pathetic 😂
They always been overpriced since i was a kid and he has a family of five
Suck it up Man stop making kids and Complaining.
Stop using that stupid expression, _"going viral"_ .
Absolutely insane price
Everyone knows that theme parks in Florida are tourist traps.
I agree that the greed is crazy, but imagine giving your kids a core memory that they will always appreciate and remember, and all you do is bitc# about how much you paid,   Should feel ashamed making your kids feel bad because you’re crying about how much you spent on national t.v   As a father you should’ve done all the research on pricing when you were planning the trip instead of crying like a little Bitc# when it’s over.   Sure 2-5 grand is a lot, but you only have to take them once and they will never forget it, it would be well worth the price for some core family memories.
I've only to been to Disneyland three times. Twice in LA and once in Tokyo. The LA one I went over 10 years ago and I will never go back. However the Tokyo one was amazing! There were still a lot of people but nothing compared to LA. Much more respectful people and cleaner as well. Tickets were 55 per person so not too bad compared to US prices.
Disney is just for celebrities and their kids now
Good for this Dad telling the truth about the mouse who wants all your money!
Well, I wasn’t expecting Flying Wheels to go viral for this !! ! 😂
Reporter indicated prices have improved under Donald. Prices have increased since Trump came in office. Why is it that Fox and Friends always praises Donald? I've had to stop watching this network because of the requirement to salute King Donald. Thank you for sharing these story on the expense to attend Disney World. We decided to CANCEL our trip to Disney World DUE to this video.
Why take your kids to such a woke expensive place? Take them in beautiful National Parks, take picture of birds, of wild life. Disney is for stupid people.
He is right disneys springs is to expensive eating there is 30 percent higher we eat off site!
How much did you pay for them goofy looking Mickey mouse ears???
Disney is scam it seems.
Florida governor needs to go after Disney for a Monopoly and take away all those studios from them, for they are a monopoly (so is comcast and amazon).
Its always been too expensive 😮 Remember my parents complaining about the $$$ ticket prices decades ago......
Trumps America
Dollywood Tennessee here I come
disney a "rip off" extraordinaire. Don't plan to ever go back.
Awe, that little girl just hitting us right in the heart. Just goes to show that true quality time spent with your family is more golden than any ride at Disney.  Well done young lady. ❤
In June 2006, my wife and I were 23 and we went to Disney World for about 5 days. We got a free meal incentive thing so we we got 2 meals and  a snack each day for free. The food was fantastic and plentiful every where we went (and free). Between airfare, the resort (some Caribbean Island themed thing), the lodging, tickets, souvenirs, pictures, gratuities, I think I maybe spent about $1,100 for the whole shebang for BOTH of us. We went to every park once and went to Animal Kingdom a 2nd time the 5th day. I did spend an additional $40 one night and ordered some late night pizza delivery from this place in Orlando called Flippers. It was amazing by the way.     We had a nice time, but wouldn't go back at this point.
Donald Trump's America  No, delusional host, it is not better under this insane regime.
Everything is Made in China Even Peace IYKYK ☎️🐉🐍🐻♟️🌍🌎🌏 Reading is Fundamental Business Never Personal The Mouse needs all the Loot
I quit supporting chomo land years ago and my kids can care less  !! There's plenty of other places they can go !
The ultimate Simp
This is just insane... I remember the tickets being 50 bucks in 1992...
I have 4 kids and were a family of 6..... Have high ticket prices and affordable food or low ticket prices and high food but not both. It's a really a killer.
Disney sucks anyway if you pay those prices you are stupid
Supply and demand: people are willing to pay it, and it is still overcrowded.  They'll keep rising the prices until less people go.  Find alternatives.
Soon his small business will be gone and his little cutie will only get 1doll …oh and she will like it! Trump economy not previous
When I was a young dad going to Disney for the first time a friend of mind told me if you worry about cost you will never enjoy it
Someone tell him to stop whining. Life is increasingly unfair. Frontline seats at the Miami Open tennis went for $10k - and that's just the Miami Open. Imagine front seats or closer seat at Grand Slam events eg. Wimbeldon, French Open, US Open. Then imagine prime Super Bowl tickets. Or even just English Premier league football 90 minutes + food/drinks time for big stadiums - $2,000 for 3 ppl. Maybe it's a one-off trip in a decade
that father is suffering from ptsd after this family vacation you can see it in his eyes
Yo is nobody in this comment section going to mention his daughter’s favorite part was talking to her family while waiting in line for a ride? That was so unexpected and choked me up.  Goes to show how far brain rotting is going in social media 😂
Cheapskate I would have bought the lightning tickets might as well you already spent jalf
I went to Disneyland in 2019. Probably will never visit again. It's not the same as it was when I was a little kid in the 90's.
Id like to take my son to Disney. Hes never been and his 10th birthday is on July 2nd. Any tips?
She acted like she couldn't squeeze😮😮 Yoda's nuts.😂
Groomers
the have to recoup losses from all those crappy movies
What a waste of money!!! That could’ve been about 4 car payments!!! Or 3 or 4 months of groceries. Or a baby emergency fund!
Why it’s much better to be single and free!  These fathers have to work their butts off to try and please the old wifey and kids!  Then one day he drops dead from a heart attack!  Not worth it!
Stay home and rent a disney movie a lot cheaper.. If there's any good ones out there anymore.😂
Well, you people keep going to those parks anyway!  You complain but you keep going!!!  So don’t complain!  Disney just posted a good profit recently so all of you Dumbos out there keep going anyway!  Stop going!   Stop!!!!!!!!!!
UNREAL,HOW CAN A COMPANY DO THAT TO FOLKS.I WOULD NEVER GO THERE🥲🤮
I always enjoyed the trips we took to Disneyworld in the past - has been a long time but now, Disney has come to represent everything I’m against.
You see all what Disneyland has? Looks like a very wealthy place it's From all the people that drop 10k everyday and go back to their normal day when Disneyland is cashing in all your money. That money you could have got half of the stuff at Amazon it's all from China just cause it has a Disneyland printed on the items it makes it so special because it's Disneyland. It sure is a sad place after all.
Way too much money for only that,pretty much a freaking rip off.
under the last administration? wow bimbo - chump just fired masses of people who now cant afford eggs let alone Disney trips...wow
its really simple, if you cannot afford it, do not go there.
For $1,400 I’m jumping on a flight overseas.
Last administration lol! Its just as expensive now as before, at least here.
Disney is not going to get a single cent of my money!
I went to Disney as a kid in the late 80s and remember the lines already being long then. Decades later I had kids and never once took them to Disney, because I still remember the lines of when I was a kid. When I found out that lighting passes existed and how much they cost, I doubled down on ever taking my family there. Repeat after me, Disney is one of the least greatest things on earth with those prices and lines. We have enjoyed numerous vacation everywhere else but Disney.
It cost about that much for 5 days park hopper in la  lmfao if you can’t afford Disney then don’t go there other theme parks out there that are cheaper🫨
Her answer at the end probably made her parents so happy. You can they loves each other.
How much does it cost to go to a two hour NBA game? NFL ticket? Hamilton on Broadway? This is ALL day entertainment for you and your family. Just because it’s not your “ thing” doesn’t mean it’s wrong. There is no cleaner place like Disney World . Like the saying goes… You get what you pay for. I also like to say to Fox ( who I watch every day ) please let it go. You attack Disney any chance you get. You can’t beat the Mouse ! That mouse and Walt’s vision has brought so many memories to so many people. Full disclosure, I am a resident of Orlando and we like you to back off the mouse already! 3:37 3:37
This whole video I kept saying F Disney, like a mad man 1400 FOR A DAY F DISNEY 😂😂😂
You could not pay me to visit Disney
Not doing this. That’s going into a savings account for the kiddos!
How is it getting better under this administration? Show me one good example... please, I'll wait 😅 and stop blaming corporations like Disney when they are just playing the capitalism game
Aww man, i wanted to blame it on tariffs but found it hard to link
Was it worth going to Disney no. Was it worth getting to spend an enjoyable day with your family, that's priceless! Wait a few more months and those lines are going to decrease with the halt in European tourism! The price might even come down a bit to tempt more customers!!
Born in 1970: I was between 8 and 9 yo the 1st time I went to Disney in Anaheim. I went with a neighbor and her family and  my mom gave me $20 to spend in the park other than entry costs.  I came back home with the same $20 because even back then as an 8/9 y o, I thought everything was just too expensive.  Imagine an 8 or 9 y o not spending money at Disney because the kid thought it was expensive back in 1978/1979 😮
Wouldn’t spend a single cent on their trash.
Who still gives Disney money after the last few years?
I mean, thats capitalism right?
No thanks! 😂😂😂
Only fools pay disney
...this is news? Disney is expensive... yeah. yeah it is. Don't pay it.
Disney has been evil for years. Don't give them your money.
Keep supporting Disney then...
Disney has to increase the costs because of lack of tourism...did you think it would be cheaper??
They need to recoup for Snow White
Disgusting
Funny how at 2:23, Fox lies and says the cost of groceries has gotten a bit better thanks to Trump. The definition of propaganda.
You kidding me. Shame on this father. No one tell you to spend that money. You know as a Florida resident how much Disney are ? I live outside Florida. And we know even with resident discounts , it’s expensive. My daughter, husband and 2 kids have seasons pass because 1 ticket it’s $ 180 each. Take it as memories with your family.   At the end it’s money. And if you can afford it. Don’t due it. Some parents are miserable with their own kids.  I am sure they have a good time.
Way too expensive. We went last year family of 6 only the tickets cost $1200 per day
The long lines and the Heat mix with the humidity, makes it not worth it
Don’t have so many kids problem fixed look at God
Fox taking up for this administration nothing has gotten cheaper or better.
Im surprised they didn't give them all a pamphlet on Trans rights
Disneyland and Disneyworld should be shut down and investigated!!!
I'm 57 and I am done with going to Disneyland or any theme park with my child anymore.  Used to be not this extreme, and I;m truly thankful that I am done done with it before it went extreme, Nonetheless, this is getting ridiculous honestly and the only way to stop it is  to boycott Disneyland...(if you can control your kids and your kind of guilty feeling)
Why u put ur kid in woke land and pay 1400 usd too?
$30 just to park is insane. If you can afford to go to Disney World and not go broke, I guess you should at least once. I'd like to go but it cost more than I can afford to give up, plus I don't have a kid and if someone comes up to me talking about Disney World being for kids only I'll say some very non-kid friendly things to them.
How many  rides did you actually  get to ride.
Bob Iger ruined it!
Didn't this father check beforehand how much parking, ticket cost, etc. would cost? You don't have to be a genius to know that food bought at these theme parks won't be cheap. That's poor planning on his part. If you're going to be shocked by how much you have to pay for a day at an amusement park, then maybe you should take your family somewhere else
I had a very boring childhood due to not having much money, now I see why.
😮🤯
Now, the trip has been paid for in views
Groceries are still really expensive sweetie, as well as electricity and insurance.
This is the perfect example why I have never been a Disney fan.
It’s insane to think all this security just to enter at Disney, while under Biden, our borders were wide open to anyone who wanted to enter
This idiot reporter just had to ruin a non political story with a jab at “the previous administration”. Corporate greed is strong on both political sides. As far as keeping it specific to Disney, Walt’s turning in his grave at how his company is financially ruining people. He’s not just turning, he’s on the spin cycle in there!
Every family should boycott Disney.
It's so sad that most kids won't be able to experience Disney in their lifetime. They've priced out those who can't afford it. Very sad 😢
Did a Disneyland day pass back in '86,from memory think it was $50.
Disney World and Disneyland have absolutely ZERO REASON to lower prices until people stop going to their parks.
This guy got out of there cheap! It usually costs much more. Park costs will be going up even higher with fewer visitors this year to make up for lost revenue.
Its insane how much a disney trip cost🤦🏿‍♂️
He literally should have got annual passes if he spent that much already. The Florida passes aren't that much more
It's a cult. Only people in a cult would pay that much.
It used to be $25.00 each including the bus ride from Miami and breakfast.
blaming the company is a good way to make this a never-ending cycle. its just supply and demand. The Disneyland experience has changed and people don't want to accept change.
this reporter tried to blame Biden for the economy. 😂 And even said that this administration is better.
Great vacation for family, Stockyards Rodeo TX, Eagle Lake Pontoon boat rental,  John Wayne Museum Ft. Worth -CHEAPER THAN DISNEYWORLD
That's a family of 6, I wouldn't think twice . Especially,  if your going to Disneyland. You dont just wake up one morning and say , " Hey family of 6 , lets go to Disneyland" .  You plan ahead for that kind of a trip . If your a local, buy a pass instead and include parking .
Why r u surprised its owned by china they need money
stop going to Disney , force them  to bring those prices down ,
Disneyline the unhappiest place on earth.
I thought at the end of the segment she was gonna send the family back to Disney with lightening passes this time... but nope 🤦🏾‍♂️
Boycott Disney! Thats ridiculous!
Jesus I live on the west coast of Canada and I can fly myself and my wife to Tuscany and rent a beautiful air b&b for a week for $2k Cad or $1400 USD. That’s an insane waste of money .
I wouldn't take my kids there if you paid me.  I'm not even being facetious.  Why people will pay money to wait in lines and be jammed with other people all day I have no idea.  I can think of 100 things I would rather do with my kids!  But, supply and demand will always win.  You can't complain about something you were willing to pay for.
They're gonna use all of that money to push some agenda anyway so why pay  Duh  🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Universal studios is so much better.
😅😢😮😭😭😭🤮🤮🤮🤮☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️😱😱😱😵😵 Thanks God you have a very sweet daughter ❤❤❤❤❤
a day pass should be around $40 per adult food around the same price
I have been there and done that. Can't go back.
Here's an idea: STOP GOING. 😂
If you go to Disney World, any type of Disney property You’re gonna look at $7000 around there just for three adults and and two kids my opinion it’s not even worth it. It sounds all that fun that I have a price.
Make you wonder how much of the money is given to staff at Disney?
They don't call it Di$ney for nothing.  Was he truly surprised?  Did he do any research?
That’s nuts… and that’s USD.. after conversion for a one day of fun and a meal… fudge that!
It's ridiculous how expensive it has gotten ... I don't go to disneyworld but I go to Disneyland I went just last week and I have had foot pain for the past year now only getting worse doctors don't know what's wrong ... I tried to rent an ECV electric wheelchair for the day ... yeah I basically said nope forget it I'll push through the pain. $80+tax on an ECV that's basically half of another person's ticket no thank you! Just shows how money hungry and inconsiderate they are towards the guest I remember when they used to cost around 60  Yet they have made their DAS pass almost impossible to get now disney has changed so much unfortunately also feels like I spend more time on my phone mobile ordering and getting fast passes etc then taking it all in like we once did in the past so sad
What a sweet girl
DO NOT give them YOUR hard earned MONEY!!
I don't have the patience to wait in line.
My answer would be the same as the little girl's answer. Because I don't like anything about disneyland either. I just  like being with my family.
They shouldn't be paying for parking. At move world and dream world you don't pay for parking.
Disney charges it because they know fools will pay it. Fools pay it because they need Disney!
That's ridiculous! They could talk at a park, go swimming, fishing, hiking, bike riding etc for less than 1400.... including cost of bikes and fishing poles.
Ever since wokeness squirmed its way into Disney, I don’t even mention or think of anything Disney. Really nobody I know does either
Its so worth going to the Happiest Place on Earth 🫶
Bro has almost half a million followers on YouTube…..he ain’t hurting
If the dad is in shock about prices then he shouldn't go. No one's fault but his
Never went never will🤘🏼
no sympathy for them. simply DONT GO
I lived in Florida for about a decade and never once wanted to go to Disney.  It was not worth it !
You people just found that out now lol 🤡🤡🤡🤡
I watched so many videos about Disney before I went for the 1st time a few years ago They helped me save a ton of money and time
Kendall rocks 🎉
The little girls answer at the end is sweet
These amusement parks are pure greed.
Stop making money-loser-woke-kid-indocrination-Disney movies...losing hundreds of millions and billions over the past few years..
I have more fun with my PS5, 1yr psn and vr 🤣
5 days two kids three adults 10 grand
I'm from anaheim and I can't afford disney
That's too expensive for most people.  Blowing a few thousand dollars just for a few days of "fun". Only the upper middle class (doctors) or super wealthy can afford a trip like that where $1500 a day is nothing.
That's about right, it's the new normal. 🤫
If you do not think it is worth it, do not go. Simple as that.  If you break it down, it is probably $10 a ride
It’s a complete disgrace what has happened with Disney in every aspect .
🤮
Everything is going up and up again. Trump lied.
they gotta get back their loss on the snow white somehow 😂
Imagine those on min wage 😢 it’s a once in a lifetime thing not a day trip
Even though the dad is right, he is overreacting a little bit over it. Like it is nothing new about the prices. I love how he wants to treat his family but he could save more by going elsewhere. It just sucks the average family can't go here because of these greedy companies. :(
Disney is the “groomer” paradise.
Did she say it’s gotten alil bit better under the current administration??????🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
$1400. She will never forget it. Her favorite part was standing in line and talking. That hurts.
This is literally the same channel telling me everything is ok 😂
Will never go they are very evil learn about Illuminati. Biggest company behind the Devil
I mean what you expect its disney world
my family  love to hunt fish  boating  hiking and camping out
I dont even go to the mall now. 😅
Just to go to 1 Disney park it’s 200 dollars and I’m a Florida resident/first responder with 4 kids. I want to take my kids but I just can’t afford it. My kids will continue to see Disney on tv.
Well, every time a new ride is added, we are paying for it!
It used to be affordable to the average middle class family.   Not anymore.  I remember buying expensive water bottles, it all adds up!  It’s packed there. , though!
People like to say negative things about Walt Disney's World theme parks. People should look at a full documentary on Disney's parks so that they can see why the parks are so expensive. If it wasn't for Walt Disney and everything that he was doing for all of us to enjoy. We would have not had any theme parks or castles or anything. Thanks to Walt Disney we have these beautiful theme parks we could all enjoy with our family. People should Thank him a lot for everything that he created. Yes, the parks are expensive and everything but people should enjoy every single detail of each theme park attraction of Walt Disney. So, please everyone please do not be so negative about the prices at the park. Just enjoy everything that Walt Disney created for all of us to enjoy with our families and the little ones. Thank you Walt Disney Company for everything that you people do for not giving up on Walt Disney's dreams and hopes and for believing in the Walt Disney Magic.
$30 billion lost in 💩 woke movies drives up the cost
Can you imagine the anxiety in the parents after paying so much money and having to pretend they enjoy the day in front of their kids?
People are dumb. Bad financial choices
CNN will blame Trump
If you want to get on the rides, you have to go at night when its close to closing time.  Then most visitors went home, and our family was able to go from one ride to the next without any waiting.   We stayed the whole day and night until they closed.   My kids were tuckered out but at least I got them on all the rides!  Woohoo!!
You can tell it was his wife's decision
My parents took us to Disney World once in the early 80s.  I doubt if the admission was more than $20 a person because my parents are pretty frugal.  Disney is all about greed and woke propaganda today.
The prices will keep surging until people won't pay. The Florida factor keeps me out. I hate the humidity. The crowd sizes were overwhelming when I was there. The lines for rides were like over 2 hours long in some cases, and now they let people pay to cut ahead into the lines.
Sounds about right for a family of 5 these days, if you want to have a lot of kids better make a lot of money.
Always blaming the previous administration 🙄
Ruin her childhood experience because you couldn't figure out how to save and plan ahead..you don't have to dine there you can go on cheaper day...hence last minute  try planning next time
Fuk Disney
Haha ‘because of the last administration’ nice one.
Disney is a cyclical cult. From toddler age to young teens kids are programmed to watch their animated movies and shows so parents are forced to spend money at the theme parks and theaters. Then the cycle continues with the next generation
Who cares, its the golden age!  Youre not rich, yet?
Shocked? Dude did no research
Wow I dream of taking my family to disney world, but if the cost isn't worth it then no way. I know its crazy expensive to run that place but at the same time charging high high prices to customers will eventually cost you
I was watching without realizing it was Fox News, but at 2:23 into the video, I realized I was watching Fox.😂😂
44.99 for the lightsaber because it was made in China...
We went in 2010 and the lines were too long!! They wanted us to invest in a Disney Timeshare.  3 kids under 5 at the time, they are now adults and they don't even want to go.  Too expensive and is it worth it to go
A trip to Disney World is expensive if you want to make it, plan accordingly. $1400 or less is what I would spend for 5 days for hotel and tickets for a family of 3 and I am staying at the Embassy suites.
Mickey crackin that whip on the working man! YuppieLand...
She said It's gotten a little bit better when talking about cost and 2 different administration Better for who? Suff still going up
He's complaining about swiping his card and takes his kids to a place where the kids can be swiped but he doesn't say anything a about that!
Who cares, they can charge whatever they want.  That's how capitalism works.  Its not like they are price gouging a necessity.  Clearly plenty of people can afford it or just put it on credit cards. They are mobbed everyday, its crazy.  Its amazing how its all setup to get your money at every step.
Disney is a rip off. We live in Florida and will never go there.
Being woke is expensive
tragic something so wholesome and all American, Disney, is corrupted like this. What would Walt Disney say if he saw this ?
I mean 5 kids just about everything is going to be expensive to do something with them all together.
Me and my brother moved to Ft Lauderdale in Oct.1974. After the big layoffs! The first week here we jumped on our Bikes and  off to Disney. It was $1.00 to park and a day riding the rides was a token book of 12 tokens for 12 rides. I'm thinking $12.00.  Was also the entrance fee. Food was a bit expensive. We actually returned home and gave the left over tokens to friends that were planning to go there. Not sure but I think we spent no more than $40.00 a peace for the day including Disney Souvenirs. It has become a rich mans park. I don't know how a blue Collar worker can afford to bring his family there today. I met people that worked there later on and they said it was a terrible company to work for.  They said they were the real deal dictators!
Someone has to pay for all that woke narrative they push 🙄
I got my kids some baseball gloves,fishing license and a national park pass for the summer
Disney and Disney theme park has gone to h*ll now. I rather climb a mountain or camping in the countryside
FK Florida, Way over crowded now and way way over price. And, Stinking very very hot in summer.... My step daughter pays 3 times more car insurance down there then where she used to live. There are idiots everywhere driving and road rage all the time. Florida Sucks
It says on the internet that it cost $28 a day when i went there with my parents and brother in 1988.  It didnt cost my parents anything for a ticket because a friend of the family, a judge, gave them to my parents as a present when we were adopted and he was the judge.  He went to church with us and let us go off his land for ice fishing and paid us to mow his lawn until my dad started farming and had us work for him for free of course.  It was nice going out to eat every friday and getting stuff like football jersey's for free so we ended up getting paid that way
It’s Florida so em 😂
why the f go there?
Well, learn to say No to your kids.
Children need quality family time not fancy vacations to be happy, a nice bbq in the park would go a long way, bring some games and balls and your creating memories for life, this is all nonsense, to spend that kind of money is insanity
Two dollar made in ChaiNah plastic stick for forty four bucks.
He should try California. There is no space to park your car but they still charge you for parking your car.
Why go there then go take your kids to the park
A Disney trip is an event. Disneyland at 16 years old a million years ago. Great memories!!
I spent $10k total, flying a family of 4 to Orlando from California. Went to 4 theme parks and rented an air bnb for a week. 😢
Nope
I gave up on Disney when they went woke.  They won’t be seeing any of my money.
Thank the pres.
Family of 5? Why’s that so hard to believe
A whoper use to be 99 back in the day now a whopper is 6 n some change at burger king n that was back in jun 2017 🇺🇲
Get a Disney Travel planner. We go and stay on property. The value is there if you stay on site. There are even dining packages. You can also stay in some of the parks after closing from 9pm to midnight with literally no wait time. Still pricey but I’ve found If you can plan in advance with someone it’s a better experience.
Wait in line 2 hours for a 60 second ride - no thanks.
Thank the MAGA communist morons
Disney is pretty darn cool. Is it expensive? Yes. But a lot goes into the operation, and the workers and actors already hardly get paid. IMO it’s not a perfect world, a place like Disney is for the kids, and highlighting how much you spent at the park right in front of the kids must make them feel great for ever wanting to go to Disney, most likely also eliminating any magic they felt associated with Disney.
The happiest place on earth…………..?
I went to disney. I came out in 2 hours and made a video cursing Disney. Its that bad. Im 30 at the time. Was my fault too. Apart from the boredom for an adult, the prices should not even be for kids. Leave alone, they really enjoying it.
And how much would he pay to take a family of 5 to a professional sporting event for a few hours?   Or a play by a traveling Broadway play?  Or Universal Studios theme parks? About the same these days.
Thats a weeks pay for me, maybe go to six flags
Lmaooooo did she say “it’s gotten a little bit batter” WHEREEEE I LIVE IN TEXAS EVERYTHING IS SO EXPENSIVE!!!!! Is she stupid?
disney SUCKS and is EVIL
Maybe to cover the loss from Snow White disaster lol
Avoid mickey groomer world is the moral of this piece...
I can afford to visit the Disney each year if I want but I refuse to pay that outrageous price for entertainment. I take my kids to local places and there are many other things in the world to enjoy.
No buddy should be paying what they pay you experience something artificial as a Disney park, go spend it in nature at a beach or something but also respect Mother Nature
I follow his YouTube channel 😂
China ca-ching$$$$$
It’s a tone deaf piece. The family’s careless spending is the main problem. Their money, their choice
Omg!!!!!,,,,my wife and I just came from Disneyland for 4 days. It’s cost us $4,080 that’s without food and drinks  still !!!!!… and gifts 🎁. TWO PEOPLE
Lets give them a platform next to our running youtube channel... Go away!
I’ve never had THAT MUCH FUN at Disney to even pay a quarter of that price 😂 like you guys do this crap to yourselves
When I was youg my Disney  World was a sand box in my backyard and I had a ball with my Tonka Trucks.
I’ve always told my family “no” to Disney. We’ve taken 4-5 day vacations for what he spent, sometimes less. That’s including airfare and rental car. He probably still had those expenses, on top of getting a shakedown from the mouse.
The real magic at Disney is watching how fast your money disappears.
Disney is the epitome of American greed that sucks the life out of everyone that works for a living who goes there. Problem is most of you suckers that go there pay with a credit card then claim bankruptcy so the rest of us can pay for your trip. That's a fact.
Man, I love Chuck e cheese's
That’s actually less than I expected
THEN DON’T GO.
This isn’t news. When was Disney ever affordable?
That’s under this administration sweetie☺️
Poor planning which is not fair to Disney, now don't get me wrong Disney is expensive, but you can snag deals if you just go to the website and scroll to the very bottom and look up special deals.  I just got back from Disney and got the 4-day Florida resident deal for $60 a day with 30% off the hotel.  And I booked the day before.  Is this dude working for Universal?
Went once.. rides are for babies and old people.. never again
Can’t guilt me into paying his trip. I took family of 6 twice to Anaheim Disneyland. A week each time. It’s possible and I didn’t cry about it 😂
Why are they charging for parking
Yet, he paid.
Y not just fly to another country?
Staycations are so much easier these days
Costs have gotten better under the current administration?!  Hardly!
A thousand for what 😂😂 and you guys pay it so they’ll keep charging it 😂
Don't worry, those of us in the lower class say the same thing when we go to McDonald's,  and the playroom always is crowded and fights break out all the time.
America is a corporation... it is NOT a country
He has a good youtube channel...and a smart kid. My family was able to squeeze in a Disneyland trip one time in the around 1990, well before phones. I don't have a single photo to remember the trip by. What I remember most are the conversations in the car from Iowa to California, the conversations in the hotels at night, and the conversations in the lines while waiting for the rides.   Now, all of my family is gone. I was the baby of the family back then at 12 or 13 years old. I am so happy that we didn't have phones to distract us. I remember the important things, the people I was with. The rest...is just geography.
no pity for fools....
Just like cedar point with the rides. If you dont get the fast pass, each gooood ride has like a 2 to 3 hour wait. Not worth when your probably gonna eat amd enjoy the day you maybe only get like 5 rides in
There are a lot of fun things to do with children that don’t cost $1000 per day.
They keep losing on tv n movie production so gotta get it from ya other ways.
$1,400 is hours and hours of labor for most
Waaaah, stay tf home if you cant afford it
“It’s gotten a little bit better?” Is she for real?
Hey. He saved a few bucks on a razor and shaving cream. He should be happy!
Last administration? are you nuts is this administration that that is draining my savings every thing cost us double
I have been to Disney World four times, the last time was six months ago, and Disney IS NOT CHEAP nor is it like going to a fair and carnival that is held near your house in the summer !! If you don't have the money to spend at Disney  it's better not to go, DISNEY HAS ALWAYS BEEN VERY EXPENSIVE !!! 🙄🤦🏻‍♀️
Only the very rich can take a trip to Disney Land or Disney World, and not need to file for bankruptcy afterwards.
Take the family hiking off into the wilderness,  bring a fishing rods. Cook your own dinner
Hello!  Disney has always been expensive.  I love Disney.  I live out of state, that is why  I plan a year or more in advance.  You enjoy every minute of it.  And the memories are awesome.  I went in my early 30’s  for   the first and have gone several times since . Now that I am in my late 60’s I still enjoy Disney  and plan to go again.  Yeah Disney!  Make sure you plan ahead of time. 😊
He didn't ask for the FREAK/PERVERT discount..... And I'm not saying anthing about him or his family, just the reality that the FREAKS/PERVERTS WILL get a discount.
Trumps disney
If you knew what Disney is all about you wouldn't have anything to do with that!
I believe it was expensive twenty years ago. To me it's just ridiculous for the prices for everything including food and gift shops as well. Not everyone can afford to go, but it would be nice if they would consider everyone. I wonder what Walt would think of it today if he was still alive?
You should know before you go!! Dumb Dumb! People who don't live in Florida know exactly what it costs for their vacations!! Ridiculous!
Most of the ‘entertainment’ there is lowest common denominator tat.
You’d have to pay me to go to Disney and I still wouldn’t go.
Just go to Universal lol
I'm sure he can afford it, and he wanted publicity.
I pray my daughter out grows mickey mouse cluehosue
Thanks Trump
Don't have kids if you can't afford them.    Just get an annual pass.
Hate to break it to you, but a Disney trip is not for you.  You are not a customer they want.  Disney want bigger spenders and bigger earners of the type that don't care what the price is and that is why you are being priced out.  Disney still get the customers and while they have that, the price will keep on going up.
After I moved my family to FL, we took our twin daughters to Disney for their 5th bday.  Even with the FL resident discount, it cost over $200 just to get into the park, plus $20 to park the car, never mind the cost of drinks, etc.  I told my husband that was the last time we were doing that.  Total rip-off.  I'm glad we did it ONCE, and have ZERO regrets never going back.  My girls are now in their 20s, so it would be ridiculously expensive even though it's only a 2-hr car ride away for us.  SMH x 100.
Disney said they raised their prices on purpose to reduce the amount of people who come, which will reduce the amount of people in lines, etc. instead idiots just continued to pay
Faux News of course blaming Biden for price of groceries when it was caused by Trump's COVID negligence more than anything else..f-u, Faux News..now saying it's gotten better LMAO
Yes I haven’t taken my family yet because of the crazy cost.
Wow, almost $1400 just for 1 day, the theme park loves to steal your money, especially people like you don't know what to do with money and if you can spend $1400 in 1 day just take it and don't cry about it.
Are we great yet? Day one yet?
Get your money up loser
When the power goes out in a storm is actually wonderful. The kids would come look for us and we would play with the flash lights. Eat ice cream because it was going to melt, our excuse anyway.
Bring money! 🤣🤑
Here in SoCal my local Disneyland can kiss it, I always go to Knott’s Berry Farm and the Ticket is just $80 or less (I think) and is way more fun with Snoopy than that stupid Mouse
Epic Universe May 2025
I have been in Florida since 2001 from NY, I haven’t been and probably never will🙄
Walt Surely Couldn't Be Real Happy 'Bout This Crap. Good Job Dad, We ALL Feel Ya lil Brother. Ur lil Girl Ther Seems 2B Happy, Healthy & Aware Of Her Surroundings So Again, Good Job Dad. ALL Kids Should Get a Chance @ Disney @ Least 1nce in Their Lives But APPARENTLY 'DISNEY' DOESN'T AGREE Since The Ol' Man ISN'T Around Anymore. Hmm.......Sounds Kinda Like NO!!! X-ACTLY LIKE WALMART Since Ol' Mr. Sams Demise. Crappy Offspring Living High On The Hog & ALL From What Somebody Else Created. I Don't Kno How 2Think Like That. Odd. 💯💔😖🤙🥃🇺🇲🏴‍☠️
All Biden's faults
In other news, water is wet.
This guy didn't buy any food or gifts at the park? You can tack on another $400-$500 for this alone. I did the 50th anniversary of Disney with my sister (we're both women in our 40s) with no kids and the week alone set us back about $12,000
You know what... I'm TIRED of hearing "STORIES" about how expensive food, Disney, etc. costs BUT the sports stadiums continue to SELL OUT! When I see the games HALF FULL then I will believe people are so called "struggling."😮😮
Does that come with a refund for paying to see SNOW WHITE?
Expensive and overrated.  I’m in my late 40’s.  Never been to Disney and am quite ok with that.
People dont go there twice so they need to make your life's money all at once
Same in vegas
I am still and will continue to boycott all things disney - I will not give them 1 cent so they can further indoctrinate our children.
A toy 50 dollars.
Should’ve rented a couple of Disney movies and cooked at home
Holy Sheet!  Finally something Disney did right...by accident...the lines are so long and the wait times so horrid that it actually brings families together! 🤣
Most families overspend on food.  Buying individual meals for each person instead of buying fewer meal and sharing buffet style.
Lightening pass is an OPTION not a requirement. It has his choice  to spend that extra $400 for that.
Thats called legal robbery
It’s always been crazy expensive, people can’t afford this crap.
Go camping!
Well yes the prices are way out of line in 2000 the prices for out-of-staters was 50 or $60 per person for both parks it was a blast from the past 🇺🇸 thank you for the interview from the family
Disney has been made into places made only for rich people.
Walt wouldnt want this
They live in FL. What abt the folks who have to travel to get there. Now you are factoring in air fare or a long car trip and overnight stays.
Disney sucks...
What a cry baby they didn't force you to go such a whinebat who's promoting his channel on the news
If Disney World is too expensive for you to afford, don’t go! You have other options.
This could have been a headline for the past three devades, really. Middle class families just can't afford Disney World or Disneyland anymore.
Well maybe 🤔,  instead of 3 rides , just one ride. But you'll have to pay a lil extra... it's for the best
Seriously… five kids and two adults at Disney??? There are more cost effective options.
I bought a $600 SoCal Imagine annual pass (lowest tier) in November. The best $600 I ever spent! I go every week. I've never bought anything and I don't eat there other than a Starbucks coffee. I get where he's coming from but it's still a wonderful place. Disney is charging concert/sporting event prices.
Moral of the story don't have five effing kids
This is the same lame story I have been hearing about Disney park visits for decades.  Just stop.  Going to a Disney park is not mandatory.  It's completely optional.  And if you really care, you can do a little research to calculate the cost of your visit before you go.  No surprises or fake shock necessary.
Disney always been expensive… when my dad was a kid he told me my grandparents saved up for like two years just to take him and my uncle to disney world
Apparently not all of us are BROKE or did you put that all on your CC?
It cost me 1400.00 for 4,  back in 1999 for a 1 week stay at a hotel, food, 5 park hopper pass at Disney World.
It should be even higher based on how many people were there
That place is ghey
Brutal!…  Get ready for the tarrif effect! Sorry! 🤷‍♂️
Poor beggar white male can’t pay for Disneyland  If you can’t afford it then don’t have a child  Stop making news headlines poor man
Did she just saying buying groceries has gotten a little bit better? Lady stop lying in our face!!! 😡😡😡😡
Kids nowadays are not even excited about going there, its the parents who force unwilling kids to go as seen on this very case. The kid didnt wanted to wear the mini mouse had so dad had to wear it, no kid of today can tell you any disney movie or character you can find at those parks.
Is America great yet
“ under the last administration “ = delusional propaganda
Go to Busch gardens
Just another reason why I take my family to see the world instead of to Disney World even though we're in Florida.
Imagine paying 1400 bucks to Stand in lines
Its ran by woke liberals who care so much.
How about 134% tarif, thanks to ......
My 7year old daughter had more fun at GatorLand
We as consumers can control this, but everybody is just like oh well its what it is and they pay astronomical prices. Stop supporting this nonsense and they will drop the prices once they see their precious sales plummet. But that will never happen unfortunately. If you think its bad now, its just going to get worse. And if you think any of these companies are going to willingly lower prices out of the kindness of their hearts then your middle name is gullible
Wow, that's costly for a day? You think it would be abit cheaper. For a day pass, you think their would be a limit on ppl so you can get on as much rides as you can. I know they probably spent alot to make Disneyland so I can see why it's abit pricy.
Complains about cost then proceeds to be interviewed while wearing a set of Minnie Mouse ears?
........
Why do people even want to go to Disney world?
That’s absurd. I would never ever spend that much.
I remember commenting on a post about this like 6 years ago and democrats and republicans guilt tripped everyone saying its a luxury service to be there. Now it seems like the average person cant afford it and is offended by these prices.
You can take your money with you when you die. May not do you much good.
just stick with your local strip club they have Disney there too all ages lol!!!!
No one forced you. Stop complaining.
Last time I went to Disneyland was 10 years ago and I don’t plan to ever go back there!
Former Disney Cast Member here.  Tried to make it work for 9 years.  Very low pay.  Can’t make a living there.  If folks want to spend that type of money there, that’s their choice, but it’s a choice not a necessity.  Disney Adults is another story.  They have a addiction
lol at “under the last administration” shoehorned in there.
Disney is spinning in his grave, parents held hostage by marketing to the kids….obscene greed…
It's priced thst way to keep the trash out, I will use carnival cruise as an example of what affordable brings to your establishment. High prices keep people noce
This is also unfair for the Disney adults that want to enjoy the magic.  We all know the Mouse is busy flirting celebrities. But why do that, it is supposed that is the happiest place on Earth, now's the wealthiest place on Earth and capitalism. What a dystopian world!
Imagine from a person coming from New York 19 Hour Drive. It was four people and spending the night in a hotel in the line for those Rise are ridiculous. I understand how this gentleman feel. I had to hold money for a long time for taking my kids. They have fun but my pocket did it.
Idc how much money in my pocket, that's just too much money to spend at a park
Disney has been like this. We went ten years ago for a week vacation. We spent almost 12k family of 6. No regrets my kids told me that was the best Christmas they ever had. Been back 3X since 😂😂😂. You only live once
For Disney in CA, the parking is even more expensive, and that the video is not even counting the snacks, desserts during the day and lunch?! This is not the total price.
I take mine on road trips and visit state parks and national parks
It all comes down to greed. They can limit the amount of people in the park at a time or they can lower prices. They don’t want to do either
Father should not have been surprised by prices.research first. Also choose your priorities! Pay bills.giveto the needy. Disney?
the real idiots are the consumer keep paying for this bs ..
Disney would be affordable, if Joe Biden was President.  Its a shame what Trump has done to the cost of everything.
Are people still surprised at how expensive it is? I mean this isn't anything new, this has always been the case, where even back in the 90s, many would have considered a trip to Disney as too expensive (a reason my family only went once a year even though we were only half an hour away). Add in that even though it's expensive, many are still more than happy to pay the extra cost, thus giving Disney no reason to reduce prices.
He does car content his YouTube channel 🔥🔥🔥
Good ole Walt Disney wouldn’t be happy  - that’s not what his vision for the park (Disney Land) was about.
Floridians aren't shocked at all though.
I consider myself the luckiest man on earth that neither of my daughters ever showed the slightest interest in Disney when they were kids. I’m guessing once my grandchildren start coming around is when I’ll pay that karmic debt!🤣
What does the last administration have to do with Disney prices being so high? It's a private company who can charge whatever they want. Not sure why the host would blame the last administration. Disney will keep charging higher prices.
With the Florida resident specials you don't save money on a day ticket, but you get a 4 day pass at a discount. My 4 day park hopper pass with all taxes came to $292 for an adult, which works out to $73/day. I also ate at less expensive quick service options and did not dine in Disney Springs when the day was over.
Why go here tourist trap.
1. Stop wasting your money at that craphole. 2. Its not the most magical place on earth.
I think Disney is broke and needs the money.
Growing up in the 80s and 90s and going to Disney 3-4 times a year as a native Floridian……if it cost $50 for the day that was too much. This is unacceptable nonsense. Walt must be turning over in his cryogenic receptacle. Corporate greed run amok.
That's actually not bad for a family of five at Disney world and the surrounding area. Plus you ate several meals in different restaurants throughout the day.
Just took 50k$ out of their stock smh
Back in 2015 I had a pass for Disneyland which was around $55 a mouth, it was for both Disneyland and California adventures but it was not cheapppp!!!!
I mean for 3300 you can stay for 4 days and get tickets to the park as well nothing else included…congratulations you played yourself
I boycotted Disney 7 or 8 years ago for a myriad of reasons.  Never again.
Just so you know, Disney is one of if not THE biggest human traffickers on planet Earth…
Stop watching after the idiot from fox said it's gotten better under this administration, what a tool
Everyday prices were bad “under the last administration”…. So you are a propaganda arm of the current administration whose tariff trade wars are raising prices of almost everything?  Things were not worse under the old admin, the polices of the new one are making things worse.
She said “ it’s gotten a little bit better “ Bih where?
Waste of money, he definitely didn’t HAVE to pay for this for him and his family, they could have settled for something in their budget or less expensive but nope. Keep paying and prices will keep going up. nobody ever listens.
And they want to get rid of beloved attractions and characters like the br’er characters and splash mountain
We are not rich, I would say upper middle class, but I like that Disney and Universal are expensive, because it keeps trashy people away.  They always cause trouble!  Since they have nothing or very little to lose, they won’t hesitate in causing trouble!
Its high for a reason.  Go to places like 6 flags . If you want cheap. And see whos there and what goes on. 😂
What kind of man wears Mickey Mouse ears and goes to Disney?
Disney is NOT worth it
If he went to Disney, not even looking into the cost beforehand, that’s his problem. Go cry elsewhere.
If people just stopped going it would send a clear message that this level of greed will no longer be tolerated.
we would love to come on Fox news with no youtube channel in our background and explain our disney trips from people who go all the time and we are not rich we just know how to do disney
I keep hearing that most families can't afford to go to Disney, yet all I hear about are the long lines and the few rides you get to take over the course of the day.  So even given the astronomically high cost to spend even one day for a family, crowds are not going down. So this just tells me people still find value in overpaying for the entertainment they feel they deserve. Huge disconnect but is a part of the reason why they are so far in debt.
Rip off.  Take them to a Taylor Swift concert instead.  Only $5K for 3 hrs of entertainment!
It's supply and demand people.  Like the said, the lines are SUPER LONG.  That means that if you don't can't comfortably drop $2000 on a one-day trip of 5 people to Disneyland, DON'T GO!!  There's plenty of people who WILL.
Spent a week there. Family of 5. Costs me nearly $10K! That’s including airfare, staying at one of their “value” resorts, multi-passes, food, etc. 💸💸💸
Went to Florida with my girlfriend for 7 days. Spent like 370 for animal kingdom, a little over 500 for Halloween horror nights, 350 for both universal parks and the rest of the days was just shopping and whatever else we can find. We probably spent a combined 3k for the whole trip which isn’t bad in my opinion. It was worth it. Main tip is don’t go to Florida for Disney lol that’s how you go broke
Just come to universal, issued solved
I luv this dad!!  These prices are ridiculous
I'm just glad me and my family went to Disneyland in 2016 before the greed increased tenfold. What a time it was, but rest assured, I am NEVER going to Disneyland again.
The last administration?!! Pffttt
People need to boycott Disney.
I hope president trump’s new tariffs will affect the Disney Parks, then everyone can go to Disney World.
I mean you have a choice to go or not lol. You have an idea of the cost before you go. I took my 2 year old there in March.
I will NEVER understand grown a@@ men who go online to complain! DONT GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It’s not like these prices should have been a surprise…plus the lightning lane pass was a very small cost compared to the rest of it, nowhere near the same as the rest of the cost. He just wanted a popular video.
absurd.  for indoctrination
Wasn't expecting Flying Wheels to be here lmao
Well at least Disney magic still exists in my VHS collection.
No thanks..I’d rather go to Yellowstone national park or safari tour.
Disney charges that amount because you fools keep paying it.
Disney is a "rich mans playground"
😂😂😂she said yea with this administration it’s better…no lady it’s not
😂😂😂😂 It's Disney!! It's always been expensive!!! 🤦‍♀️
Didn't expect to see Craig here....but WOW at Disney!!  $1400....and it didn't come with lighting passes?  I've never been to Disney....sure sounds like I never will at those prices.
Wow and I thougt it was bad when I quit going to Six Flags when tickets went up over 40$.
Much better times in 1989 when I was a 6 year old child and in 1999 as a 16 year old teenager
Activities for the wealthy and rich. I won’t ever be able to take my kids there mostly likely. My parents never took me there because of that 25 years ago plus. It’s insane how much it is now.
Right now, Disney has a special of 3 days for 327 dollars. It is cheaper than Universal right now. Disney is the greatest park in the world, and we are lucky to have it in the US.
If only it was optional to go. It’s too bad we are all forced to go to Disney parks. Oh, wait, it’s entirely optional. Don’t like the price? Do something else.
I got to enjoy Disney world 🌎 in 1989 with my parents at age 6 for under $200 for a family of 4. Costs today are crazy
Disney is a ripoff. If Walt is alive I don’t think this what he wanted
Now dad feels vindicated for not buying the fast passes
LOL @ it's  gotten a little  bit better.
I've always liked Universal Studios better anyway.
That was on the cheap side
He didn’t travel there and stay in a hotels
fk disney and horse they rode in.....
I went to Disney land in Tokyo for $50. I  then paid for fast track as much as I could which was an additional $30? and then I ate food there which was probably another $30? I went by myself 😅😅😅
We’re suckers for the mouse 🐭
Breaking news! Water is wet.
Only the utterly hopelessly stupid would think that you need to GO somewhere and SPEND a lot of money to "be happy."  Good parents who raise children right will give them a paper printed BOOK, such as Stuka Pilot or Autobiography of Ben Franklin or any one of Mark Twain's nonfiction books (such as Roughing It) in their quiet study room in the home and they will be happier than ever possible on any expensive "trip" somewhere else.  The home is your harbor.  Your most peaceful and happy place of joy.  Not some fake kingdom.
A small business owner 😭 this dude is loaded. Stop the cap
That’s actually cheap for Disneyland. I know people that easily spend $3000+ on a Disney trip, even as CA residents.
Disney 🤢🤮
I KNOW THOSE PPL LMAO
My mom paid for her grandkids to go but we had to take them and buy their food. That was a great deal for me and my one 🥰  She wasn’t going to have five kids alone at Disney.  I am grateful for her because Disney is not in my budget.
Why do people still go to Disney? This is unacceptable.  It is not a place for children.  Never was...
MAYBE Disney would be worth it still if they were making actually good original content. However, that died off close to 2 decades ago. Late 90's/early 00's was THE best time for Disney. You had free fast pass, great rides, good content, it wasn't ultra expensive, and the food was good. Now, it's Marvel and Star Wars Land. Not even worth what it cost 30 years ago to be there
The beach nearest me is free and empty
Can you say you are FIRED Iger?
Applaud all the parents who spend this amount for their families. It’s very hard for most parents. Happy they enjoyed it
Overprice
seeing Ron Desantis with minney mouse ears is pretty funny
Blame tariffs...😂😂😂...
Just say no
Stop making these people rich by patronizing their businesses.. they have enough money.
I’ve been wanting to take my kids, but just can’t not afford it. The average family cannot afford to go to Walt Disney anymore.
Did she say the price of groceries has gotten a little bit better👀👀👀👀
If most families can't afford Disney why is it so packed?
No one told you to have 3 kids. I’m just sayin
Part calling out corporate greed, part obvious bias against Disney.  Fox News, getting the real story….kinda…
Why is this even news….must be a slow day. It’s obviously it cost a lot to go to Disney!!! Not like this family didn’t know the prices beforehand.
What a rip off
Bob Iger needs to go now! 😡
You have to pay for their failures
Dude is such a cheap father 😂
bloody, over her the would be 3000 for that one trip , when i go on holiday for a week the most i can save is 4000
this is why we cant afford to go to disneyland in california 😢 i have 5 grandkids & they never been there
Here is an idea… don't go and boycott Disney. Watch how fast the prices go down.
It must be nice to have that kind of money.  I'm trying to pay for homeowners insurance in Florida!
The worthless and greediest place on earth. Lines are so long it is just worthless. All these parks in the US are the same. Hotels are just as expensive.
In the 50's my parents couldn't afford for us to go to DL. And my dad had full time career in the Los Angeles post office. But my surgeries came first.  I went twice with my brownie troop as a kid, and once as a young mom with my husband....baby girl stayed with the grans. As a 60 y/o adult a friend treated me some years ago. I've only been in dept once in the early 90's for $800.....if terrified me!!
You all want to move here then you gotta pay
We know this family is loaded, plus they bought the top tier tickets and food ect..
How is this news? Lol. What’s next? Mom finds groceries are expensive nowadays LOL!
So what? Try buying a rolls Royce. These are luxury purchases that are expensive.
No shock there, I'm here as a College Programer and we cannot afford food most weeks as they give most of our earnings to their business partner American Campus community, everything around us is leased or owned by Disney so in reality we give nearly all of our checks back. When it comes to guests I'm just so sorry, we cast members do our best to make magic moments, giving out water and other things to the kids when I see they are over heating or upset to make the parents a little less stressed, but then I see all the areas where the guests are being manipulated or given sub par food, given the prices people pay to come here there is no reason you should be getting anything less then whats pictured on the menu and made properly. I love working here and even with all the cast discounts we get, bringing my family down once my program ends is impossible and there is no way most of us working here could ever afford to come ourselves even with the free park ticket. On behalf of Walt I'm sorry its come down to this, this is what he built Disney to combat and just sad to see that money is the real only winning factor anymore. We should be here to bring families together and bring some joy into their lives, not suck them dry with all the charges, and costs. I get operating costs and all that but you can make profit without making the most magical place on earth nonaccessable to a lot of families that the park was built to bring in.
Friggin so Stupid!!! There are other parks you can go to and half the price. Or better yet do a different trip. Crazy. LAME 🙄🙄🙄Really???
And that’s one park for one day. Just to ride 3 rides?  Add park hopper, fast pass (or whatever greedy name it goes by now. ). Disney owns Island,ships, ESPN.  😮
Should have waited.  Disney is going to get cheaper.
You have choices
I use to love disney. They have become so dern woke and outlandish in cost..im not so sure we will be going there anytime soon. Mighht need to take out a 2nd mortgage on ma house to afford ir
Fleece Disney World....New name for it
I did that! 👱🏽‍♂️🍊☝️
Epic Universe is poised to take the lion’s share of their business this year in Florida and God, I hope it does
Pretty sure Babylon Bee covered this story years ago.
We don't eat out on vacations. We bring a cooler with food. We get a room with a small kitchen. One beer out is the big splurge. I've never, in my life (from childhood through adulthood), been on a vacation where eating out was in the budget.
They are charging what the market will bear. I've decided to say enough is enough on theme parks. Unfortunately, if prices go down, they will be even more crowded.
I knew that mouse was crooked the way him and Randy treated that poor pangolin
They’re greedy as f..k. I won’t go any time soon.
Walt Disney sat on a bench in Griffith Park, Los Angeles, watching his adolescent daughters ride the merry-go-round, the joy he saw on their faces, inspired him to create a place for both children and adults couldn’t enjoy themselves. The product of that inspiration was Disneyland, which opened 1955.  I wonder what Mr. Disney would make of his theme parks today.
But he decided to spend that, why is he complaining lol?
Was just there. The prices are crazy. The lines are ridiculously long. For an extra $300-$400 a person you can skip the long lines. My daughter's cheer competition was there, so I sort of had to go. They do let you bring food and water in surprisingly so. Not a fan of Disney ever since they ruined Star Wars and everything else they have done since they went woke.
You couldn’t pay me 100k to go to Disney world.
GEEZUS!! Keep paying for Disney's DEI garbage. Possibly the worst consumer ROI out there.
Disney “where our magic trick is emptying your wallet without hassle.”
Disney is so grassed. I went on a 7 day cruise on RCL and it cost me $1,500. He spent almost $1,400 in one day. Disney has lost their ever loving mind!!!!!
Thats why you make a budget...and something tells me the guy can afford it
The longer you go, the cheaper it is. I'm taking a family of 5 for 5 days for $2,500. That's $500 a day. I'm not sure where he's getting $10,000 from. Lol! 😆   Also, parking is $35 at Disneyland and $30 at Walt Disney World.   And that light saber was cheap because it's built in Tomorowland. The ones at Galaxy's Edge are $200.
If it were cheaper it would be even more crowded. Think about it.
I have a family of 5. We used to have the Disney annual pass. But not only was it too expensive. It was not worth it. My wife and I were relieved after not having that payment. Now, we can do many more family activities and take our children to other places without the chaos and without worrying about our wallets. Disneyland is not worth the money and they don't care how much they charge.
If people would stop going to Disney land they were empty I bet u they change there prices then😂😂😂
Before the pandemic parking lot was just $10 and then after 6:00pm FREE parking, no any more, day pass was $75 now I hear is $300, Disney become greedy and greedy ✖️❌✖️
Well, no quicker way to ensure your kid didn’t love the experience than make her aware of how much money it is costing you.😂
I lived in NJ from 1984 to 2010 then from 2013 to 2018, I'm now in Florida and spent 9yrs here and find it extremely expensive even compared to NJ.  The options here are bare minimum for entertainment, the food is below average, lacks diverse communities and culture, not friendly, and everything from Jacksonville to Miami all seems the same.  Florida is overrated and hurricanes are a headache, I would not recommend anyone move here unless your planning to not do much more in life and don't care about a fulfilling quality of life, I regret moving and selling our home in NJ.
So how many people were on the news years ago for this same issue 😂
Figuring out the cost per ride (including some of the non-ride features) per person, really puts things into perspective. Is it worth it?
We're from California,  NO MORE DISNEYLAND!!....
Been to Disney multiple times. 100% not worth it…
Dad looking at her like....."you better have had fun"😂😂
Disney is a nothing burger,  When I was a kid it was exciting to go to Disneyland in Anaheim. Now as an adult I live far away I have no interest in long lines tons of people over priced food over priced rides not to mention the woke culture that Disney has been forcing on society if Americans were just boycott it then the prices would drop it really is that simple
This is truly a first world problem☺️
I went to Disney in L.A. 20 years ago. I vowed then I would never return!  The most miserable place on earth.
Trips to Disney had been always expensive, people are probably just now realizing about it because of inflation. It’s outrageous how much all the amusement parks charges not just Disney.
Disneyland will become a trip only for the rich
Well this is interesting. This guy is a big time YouTuber who makes a ton of money flipping cars. Cars like Lambos and Ferraris
For the love of God, just STOP paying ridiculous prices! It’s not just Disney. My God, the price of beef lately. Just say NO! If we ALL say NO the prices will come down.
Isn’t it like 20 dollars for a water bottle at Disney world ?
They could have stayed home and talked with each other and saved a lot of money. 😂
Corporate greed. It’s not worth the money
People have Zero imagination these days, take the family camping, at least you'll end up with some camping equipment at the end.
Yeah.  Not going to do it.
Prices are getting better than the last administration? Faux news spinning their spin once again.
Funny. I just came from another video of someone else complaining about Disney prices and they didn't get nearly as much support as this man did. Everybody called them racist names and cheap. Interesting...
It was worse on the last administration.. lol. Trump just said hold my beer.. lol😅
I went in 2008 and it was so much more affordable back then, even with the best ticket option and hotel for a few days, with full access to all parks. Would not afford going now. Glad I already went when it was possible and affordable.
They got yall programmed
Cuckold
This is like an Onion headline.
What I want to know is, how much money did he make off of the YouTube video???
Time to pull back from Disney the 8 million people that are watching this this is just plain greed this is disgusting and shameful to the one that's running it now. Stop feeding the greedy stop feeding the needy
Universal was much cheaper than Disney. I went to Universal for the first time ever this year. We got the four days for the price of two deals and stayed at a cheap hotel off-site. Our whole trip was cheaper than what local dude spent for one day at Disney. I WANTED to go to Disney but couldn't justify the expense. No deals for Disney at the time we were there. I still want to go to Disney. One day...
I have red hair. I'd never stand in a long line in the Sun. My next ride would be in an ambulance or hearse.
DISGUSTING
Glad i went in 2008 when disney was still disney and not Gaysney
On social security that would have been my entire months check. I'll visit through videos. 😂
People keep paying it
No thanks. I'll go to Knoebels and spend 70 bucks and have an awesome time.
what did that fox dimwit mean by yes, it's high prices from the last administration and it's gonna get better? typical lying garbage from fox. Nothing is cheaper as a result of this idiot administration and it will not get better any time soon.
It’s called supply and demand. Stop going and watch prices come down.
The host should’ve asked him. How much did you make from your viral video? I bet it was more than $1400 😂. Shut up and sit down rich boy
And your point?
Disney officials need to make those yearly kickback payment's to keep them all from being prosecuted for doing what it is they do. I mean, look at how all those micky mouse kids turned out. there's a reason for that and it's really no big secret is it?
He knew how much everything was gonna cost. This was just for a viral video.
He knew how much everything was gonna cost. This was just for a viral video.
After Covid I found that vacationing aboard is actually cheaper than domestic.
Why make Disney the bad guy when the dad knew what he was doing and could’ve told his daughter no, we can’t afford it Disney is for rich people now 😂
You gotta be a special kind of stupid to pay 1400 bucks just to get in. Not if i was a millionaire
Wanna know how you save $1400 next time Dad tell your daughter no 😂
Just say your daughter’s autistic next time get a DAS pass and  Never wait in line  pro tip 😂
It was expensive in the 80s I can only imagine now.  Plus paying all that money to stand in line for 1 ride.  Not worth it.
Who buys the tickets at the gate really
its for 5 people tho, sounds about right......
Well he should have did his research or find a smaller park for fun. SMH 🤦 ppl are stupid
Just say your daughter’s autistic next time get a DAS pass and  Never wait in line  pro tip 😂
I bet this guy lives in a $2 million house in Florida right next to the park and he’s complaining about nothing 😂
Wait did she just say that groceries have gotten a little bit better since the last administration? Where the hell is she buying her groceries? I want to shop there! 😡
I bet this guy lives in a $2 million house in Florida right next to the park and he’s complaining about nothing 😂
Her final comment made it money well spent ❤❤
Maybe daddy’s rich he doesn’t care and did it for clout 😂
Last time I spent a 1400 Euros for family vacation (2 kids+2), as a german resident, this February... 100 Dollar train tickets Munich to the lovley Ski-Resort of Seefeld in Austria and back, 900 Euro for 4 nights in a 4* Suite (food and spa incl), 300 Euro for Skipass, and 150 Euro for drinks. He had a very good time!
His little girl is looking like too bad that’s great I’m on tv they’ll discover me now . Are you gonna take me back tomorrow and spend $3000 daddy 😂
My mom And I just got done with Disney and instead of a hotel we drove home. We ate at the Westins tangerine Room and had a great time! Our cost $600 flat for a day you’re doing it way wrong
My mom And I just got done with Disney and instead of a hotel we drove home. We ate at the Westins tangerine Room and had a great time! Our cost $600 flat for a day you’re doing it way wrong
That’s so  beautiful she’s just appreciates and will always share the memories it  has  nothing to do with the ride or the money
Same here in California, $$$$$
Tell your brats that you’re staying at an off Disney property that would’ve saved you a few hundred bucks off the bat. Budget them at $50 each at the park for food and toys. I bet I could’ve done your same vacation for about 2400 as a non Florida resident coming from California
How is this news ? Someone cover the gaming industry
its expensive to visit disney thats insaneand I haven't been in over 30 years
Went there during covid some how they able to get aways by packing thousands people in that place. That tells you control they had over us.
Here America, is a stupid man. Who in their right mind would spend this kind of money to Disney?  My best advice- do not expose your children to Disney- it ain't what it used to be. You are just signing up for buying Disney merch and kids nagging to take them to Disneyworld. There are better experiences you can provide your children for much less money.
Good thing I went when I was younger.
Same in Paris
Why are people still shocked? Paying for 5 people to do anything is costly. And it's DISNEY. The original ticket prices in 1955 (in California) were $5.00 each without tax. That would've equated to over $300.00 today. While not quite the numbers you pay today, $5 was, at one time, extremely difficult to get and not everyone could justify spending that much money on a theme park. Even if it was Disney.   The first park opened 80 years ago and the price to get in, eat and shop have always been just out of reach for the average person. Most people have always had to save to go.   So, why is this worth 4 minutes of news time?
That can’t be right , FL resident get deals.
Disney Trips will b always hurt the pocket book FOR MOST. And im definitely 1 of them.  But i promise to keep taking my Daughters and wife atleast once a year.  WE LOVE IT
The wait for fast pass line is longer than the regular line now 😆 Everyone wants fast pass bracelet so now the regular line looks shorter.
"BREAKING NEWS: The Ocean is full of WATER!" What a joke of a news network
975 for 5 people is actually good they lost me at the parking fee, and extreme prices for passes and food.
Disney is for rich people only. The rest of us can only watch.
The biggest "people trap" built by a mouse.
$30 to park would have made me take my family somewhere else  Which is why we dont visit amusement parks anymore for years  Divide that 1400 up and let them buy what they want
I don't support Woke ideology,  and Disney is so woke, so you could not pay me to go to the park. Boycott Disney!
Disney has turned into a predatory scam full of actual predators.
Breaking news fire is hot😂
Not bad for 5… make more money
If your an Orlando resident and pay a $350 fee in the beginning of the year you get in all the parks for free all year
I won a 1000 dollars on a scratch ticket and went to Disney in 2021 4 children (2 toddlers) (2 preteen)  2 adults… that was 1k for admission.. can’t forget hotel parking food/drink man Disney is no joke
Every family has that one person who will break the family financial struggle, I hope you become the one😊
Florida is on its way out. Too many hurricanes have hit and homeowners cannot afford the insurance premiums and the price of HOA’s. Add Trump to this and the grim picture gets worse.
Clearly not the happiest place on earth
Anyone who willingly goes to a place where crowds, long wait times are rampant, get herded around like cattle, and pay a premium on food and merchandise deserves what they get.
Annual passes are the only way to go as a FL resident lol ESPECIALLY for last minute or one day trips
I bet they couldn't enjoy themselves knowing how much it cost!
And yet he went there and paid anyways
I will never support Disney in any form again.  I dont support anti American perverts
Growing up in the 90s I always thought Disney was a luxury vacation. I never knew it was once affordable 😮
What does a round of golf cost ? For how many hours ? For the entire family ?
Ridiculous
You knew that before you went there.  Why is this on the news
What? You mean going to Disney isn’t cheap? Thanks captain obvious!!
Yah it’s the human trap set by a mouse 🐭
Thats why they opened and closed down that star wars hotel. OVERCHARGING
wanted to go to universal for nintendo land... except you have to get the 3 day all access pass to enter unless you're an annual pass holder...
There are cheaper alternatives for parking and food. When I went to Disney we stayed at a cheap hotel that had a free shuttle, and brought snacks into the park and went back to the hotel for major meals.
Just a waste of money SMH 🤦‍♂️ Disney is not a priority 🤦‍♂️
Live within your means, if you are complaining that its too expensive guess what, you cant afford it. Look for other cheaper ways to entertain your kids. Inflation is kicking alot of people out of the middle class.
Last administration please trump is worst
The economy is a little better than the previous administration? Are you kidding me? It is still the same bad economy. And it is going to get worse under Trump's administration.
Leave it to Fox to cry victim about something that someone willingly decided to do and then play victim afterwards.
Talkn with the fam 🎉
Come to CA prices even higher
If the place is full for that price, that's the right price 🤷‍♀️ I cannot afford to go there but obviously many people can.
Customers are piling in at California's Disney ...  as a middle-class worker, I felt very poor surrounded by all the wealthy there! I'll just go kayaking or bike riding instead.
The child has so much empathy trying to make her father feel less frustrated about not getting tickets to avoid waiting time. But I wish they would keep her out of it and let her be a kid enjoying the rides.
If you truly believe this is because of Democrats, I feel VERY sorry for you.
So don’t go…
Stop involving the kids in your money frustration, it will ruin the experience and make them feel guilty
People who used to go every year now go every other.  Too expensive!
He complains about the cost and claims to be pinching pennies....geniuses keep paying & supporting corporate greed...so oh well! Disney could careless & nor do I. STOP GOING.
I know, it's FOX news, but she made a hilarious joke at 2:14. 😄
Disney doesn't give you any good reason to pay the inflated cost. There isn't a new 5th park in Orlando or new expansion that can be a park in itself.   They're raising costs but only give consumers a new food item or new popcorn bucket in return. I'm not seeing a new hotel or a new land or a new 5th theme park to match the financial sacrifice.   They know people will continue to go regardless if they go broke or not
No joke, they rob you and expect you to say thank you. I had my share of bad experiences in that magical kingdom that’s more of a ripoff kingdom if you ask me . 45min to an hour for any ride and to be honest my kinds did enjoy it because their to innocent to realize it’s all a scam, the fireworks at the end are nice if you find a spot it becomes incredibly crowded. You can’t stop and enjoy the experience because you have to keep moving it’s awful and at the exit people are so crowded if someone stops for any reason they are at risk of being crushed it’s just awful. And with 3 kids you can imagine how we spent that day. I would never return, no because of the cost but because of the overcrowding. Its crazy!! I would rather take them elsewhere.
Then how about you just stop going? You know you have a choice.
Punished? You chose to spend your money there and are setting a bad example for your family. You are blessed to be able to spend the day with your family.
Whats crazy is people actually take out loans to go there.
Oh well work harder. Thats the Republican way
Back in 2022, I went to Disney World. I stayed for four days. I took a flight from North Carolina. For just myself, including travel, I probably spent between $3500-$4000. It was a fun trip. But unless you make about $350,000 a year, you might want to save up first.
I would never go to this place even if it was free. Why would I want to go and stand in line for an hour to ride a 3-minute ride and then repeat? That sounds awful
I don't know why people want to support that demonic company.
65% of families that visit Disney World have to go into debt to do it. And they spend thousands that they have pay off for years to come. You would think they would be treated better.
Meanwhile, my wife and I booked a 5 night trip with 4 Park days for us and our 2 sons for the end of July at All Star Movies and our total is $1,887 for resort/tickets. With food and fuel we should be under $2800 for the trip, and we live out of state. Disney is by no means cheap, we have dropped $10k on a trip before, but if you know what you're doing you can go for a lot less.
Did anyone hear what the Fox host said at the 2:20 mark?    Amazing.   So how is the price of groceries under Trump?
The sly “things are better with this administration”. No. No it’s not. It’s actually worse lol
Imagine if every business charged you $30 to visit their establishment by car.
Well, just wait until the tariffs kick in.
This happens every day   How is this news
Anyone noticed that living in America is only meant for the rich?
Just corporate greed. That’s why we don’t go anymore
You only went one day what about the park hopper pass, ypu have to at least go for 5 days my friend 😆
Dear parents. You ahve to be smart with your money.  Disney or a beautiful trip out of the country.  It's the same price, sometimes, less. Disney or Trip?
If you don’t want to pay it don’t go…use your research nobody is forcing you…Fox news is terrible
Why on Earth does anyone support Disneyland?? Personal preference,  I suppose? It's a solid NO for me.
Nothing new Disney has always been expensive
The costs Craig is talking about you can bet are spot on.  Craig has a youtube channel called Flying Wheels.  He has a small used car dealership in NH and has a small dealership now in FL that does mostly does buy at auction and sell at auction.  If you watch him like I do,  he is tells it like it is and is honest and straight forward.  Disney has lost it's way.
No one is obligating anyone to go. Somehow Disney parks are always full. They're good at taking peoples money. They must be doing something right to make people give up their hard earned money for these expensive Disney trips.
Tell me why Disney is worse now
Welp, at least it's a lasting memory. 😬💰😈
Under the last administration, please.
No more woke Disney for me
Orlando was built around Disney. Now that everything in that area is established, Orlando charges Disney massive impact fee's, Hotel taxes and building a new ride costing 10 million dollars permits aren't cheap!
Disney is only for the rich anyways.     Nothing new and don't know why they are complaining
Cedar point !!!!!
Boycott Disney!🤨😠
This guy clearly hasn't been there in decades.
Trump administration tariffs are causing the worst kind of inflation (called stagflation).  Plus the stock market sell-off  is just making it too hard for families to even take a simple vacation.
What did he expect??? He can afford it! Only did it for clicks and views! He’s also a YouTuber 🙄
Hey, your kids dont need 37 disneys, they should be okay with 1,2,3,4 or 5. Fox News sucks balls.
They have to make up all the money somehow from all the woke garbage movies they have been putting out that are tanking.
Speaking of cost vs value, Fox News is not a bargain.
I’ve never wanted to go to Disney. The standing in the hot sun, lining up for ages for rides, the expense, the crowds. It’s a no from me.
When you go to California, skip Disney and go to KNOTT'S BERRY FARM. I was born in 1958, with both parks as they grew. Literally hundreds of trips to each. KBF has been my choice since it was literally that...The Knott family selling berries from a wooden fruit stand on their property.  There is something for everybody there, and don't forget the Halloween Haunt which is amazing. Remember that It has a separate cost because they close the park down to prepare. They do an amazing job! ~Kim 🤗🇲🇽
I would never pay that amount. Cheaper to fly to the Caribbean.
It is priced the wait it is because there are people willing to pay for it. Remember folks, we are living in a Capitalistic USA run by corporate greed. If people refused to pay the price, it will simply go down and eventually go away.
Cope harder.
"United States, land of the fee."
Not even fkin worth it, i went back in 2016, never again,
$1,400 is not that bad. Also, you always have the option not to go. I went once and never went back and no plan to ever be back until I die. 😂
The only way they will learn is to not pay these prices. People need to snap out of the rite of passage dream of taking their children there. There is much better value to be had elsewhere in the world and not feel like you’re being shafted.
WENT IN PARIS AND IT WAS MUCH CHEAPER
This isn’t news. Everyone knows Disney is very expensive. It is what it is. No one should be surprised to see how much they spend when they have three kids.
That’s nothing
Spend time in nature
Disney Tokyo $57  Disney Paris $65-$85 Disney World Orlando, FL $119 Disneyland $100-$164
People need to stop feeding the gangsters rats
I'm sure Walt Disney is spinning in his grave.
My little one been wants to go to Disney land but a day at Disney is the same price as a 1 week all inclusive vacation so the past 3 years we go away for a week instead of there
My kids are always happiest at lakes and beaches.
Too expensive, too crowded. I have zero interest in going.
Have not been back since teenager like 45 years old 😂🤷🏽‍♂️🤣🥸
Choosing to do this story on the same day of the Disney Earnings. lol
"The Cost of Magic" - FOR SHAME DISNEY
I love Disney World I would live there if I could. You budget and save for a great time
It has NOT gotten better under the current administration!!
I have a story worthy of reporting. I bought a watch for $1000 and I am shocked by the staggering cost of my new watch!
"people can't afford pricing.... mainly under the last administration, but it's gotten a little bit better."  HOLD THE F UP...  WHAT??  LOL
This is WHY Another Brilliant Mind and Park enthusiasts should BUILD a WOLRD contender theme Park of COMPLETELY new VIBE N RIDES. America 🇺🇸 Needs to CHURN its GLOBAL capital of Mental IPs...
So to tell me you didn't know ahead of time how much this was going to cost? Now you're complaining about it? Lol!! Ok.....
Boycotting Disney
Disney has always been out of control on their prices
Did she really say people can’t afford to do groceries or gasoline at least under the last administration? What are they smoking at Fox? 🤔
The little girl said her best part was standing in line with her dad, cause she got to talk a lot with him. Be nice to take her to a park with a cooler and stare at the clouds. The whole family can join in. Disney might greed theirself out of attraction, like cars and housing.
$245 dinner for Five people is considered cheap… But yeah Disney parks are now for the rich only….
Just stay away from Florida they're other beaches you can go to and Disney is just to high
This guy has a YouTube channel. Flying Wheels. He's a smart video producer and know how to get the clicks.
And I'm sure the prices will go even higher. I doubt little if any Disney merchandise is made in America.
It’s a magical place for Disney, not for the people who go there.
Making the rich richer…you have cable/satellite you’re paying Disney everyday and then go to the park and give them more money
A trip to disney is expensive? Stop the presses!!!
It’s gotten better with this administration? Is she on coke?
That's ridiculous for that park, it's not even worth it.
No One should go to Disney until they realize that people (which they depend on), CANNOT AFFORD TO GO!!! This is supposed to be a FAMILY FRIENDLY DESTINATION... Instead they have made it for the Rich & Famous. Great keep it that way, see how far it takes you. BOYCOTT DISNEY AMERICANS!!
Disney is a for profit company.  As long as their customers will pay, charge them.  Let’s check this guy’s socials to see if he was bitching about egg prices……
A bottle of water is $6.00 but a Coke or Pepsi is $5.00 that was funny
That’s not too bad for a family of 5
Greedy billionaires and corporations...Trump's economy f*ckin sucks!!!
Did the reporter just say the price of stuff is now better than it was under the last administration? Someone fill me in on what prices are now lower
Quit going 😊
And you really thought it was gonna be cheap
Disney Springs is FREE
Americans just complain and then they continue to pay for stuff like trips to Disney. So,in the end Disney doesn’t care if you don’t like the prices because there’s enough morons that will continue to pay for it.
Disney World used to have an annual pass for Florida residents.  My nieces used to spend a lot of their childhood there.  Now they are parents they can't afford the same experience for their kids because the cost has gone out of the reach of most families.  Disney has gotten too greedy
I wouldn’t give them 25 cents for a weeks pass.
Wow a Florida resident that wasn’t aware of the cost of greed at Disney. I have no sympathy for you. There is NO shortage of information out there. If you thought your little ditty was the first to  complain well you’re late. Very late. I have a funny feeling that was part of a plan to embarrass Disney into offering a a peace offer. Nice try though.
this economy sucks!!
My Disney trips never cost me anything..........CUZ I DONT WASTE MY TIME GOING😮😮😮😮😮😮
Nope. The greedies place on Earth won't be getting our family's money!  Like someone else here said,  go see real beauty.  Go see a National Park.
The daughter in the end steels the show by saying that she actually enjoyed waiting in line because she had more time talking with her family and people there. What a positive and fresh perspective .
I live about 20min from Disneyland. I haven't been there for at least 25 years. It's just not worth it. Lines for everything & the cost is way too much for what you get in return. You get maybe 4 rides for the day & maybe 2 after dark.
Disney is a pathetic rip off
Too expensive and too many people in the parks.  The guest experience is horrible.  It’s not worth the money for the experience.  Let our annual passes expire.
I live in Florida and this year I can’t afford it but usually I get the annual pass. They don’t annual pass holders as we don’t spend as much which is true. I go with friends but I spend around $20 for food. I never buy drinks or even soda. Yet if I do buy something I use my pass for that discount but they rly like those who can drop money and there’s not as many who can. Yet they still have the annual passes and tickets super expensive.
Don't go duh😉✌
FREE LUIGI
Stop going and stop supporting corporate greed ! Simple
I live in SoCal and my girls grew up at Disneyland from when they were toddlers.  I remember back in 2002, the SoCal pass was $99 with few block out days and I would pay an additional fee for the parking pass.  As they got older, I would pay around $800 for a fam of 4 for the Deluxe pass and back then you could get Fast passes to go to the front of the line for the popular rides for free.  It was so much fun, but when they were getting out of high school, they raised the price of the annual passes to where it wasn't worth it if you would be paying the equivalent of your annual car insurance to go there.  We went a few years ago because my neighbor works there and I feel sorry for anyone who would have paid.  The reservation system is annoying when we just used to go.  The lightening lane addition was too ridiculous and even with that, you have to pay an additional fee for certain rides.  At least three of my favorite rides were closed for maintenance and several rides, like Space Mountain and Indiana Jones, kept breaking down.  Remembering how it used to be, it just wasn't fun anymore.  I wouldn't pay to go there.  I feel for any family with small kids who have never gone there, where I wouldn't be surprised if they had to cough up $5k or more for several days.
I saved for 1 year 1/2.   3 adults & 1 child with 1 baby. Three nights.   But lots of memories made.  Parade was awful not sure what happened there.
Finally an true blue American supporting other Americans.
I personally do not understand the appeal of theme parks.  Its a lot of hours in line  for 10 second rides, fighting through crowds of people and being way overcharged for bottled water.  Nothing about a theme parks is a vacation.
“It’s gotten better”????  By what metric?  I’m sure Disney products are sourced in China. Add 134% tariff
F that
What's going to happen is they are going to end up shutting down so many theme parks are shutting down because the price is too high and they can't maintain or keep up with overhead.
Yeah. This administration is making going to Disney World a "little better." Guess we know whose mushroom she's nurturing, don't we? Oh, you people who'll do anything for money are a riot.
Believe it or not, a lot of people think that the more money they spend, the better time it will be. Why would anybody want to go there???
Gross
Disney has ALWAYS been expensive! It’s ridiculous.
Don’t go then, Chinese people will still show up. They aren’t dropping the prices
My family pays for the DVC (Disney Vacation Club) so we typically go once a year. Because I'm not involved in the financial aspect of planning, I'm not very educated on the price but HOLY CRAP! 1400$ for one day?! That's insanity for me even considering the fact that this guy and his family LIVE IN STATE! I don't even wanna know the price for air fare, hotels, dining, souvenirs, and lightning lane for a 7 day trip where you go to all the parks, waterparks, and Disney springs since that's typically what most families will do for a big trip. I honestly might argue that going to Disneyland Paris or Tokyo Disney land is cheaper considering the prices are a lot lower then they are here.
Why would anybody even want to go?  You could pay a fraction of the price and go to cedar point! Better rides more rides shorter wait times. Overall better experience
Went there in 2016! The way it’s set up it’s not good !!!
Way to go !!
Thank you !!  I' ve been saying this for years!!
Me, my ex, a baby and 2 young kids cost $500 to get into Disneyland back in 2014. This isn’t about inflation- it’s pure greed.  We took the kids to another park- Knotts Berry Farm- and it was MUCH less expensive AND the kids had way more fun
DisneyWorld and Disneyland were always expensive but over the recent years they have reached new lows with price gouging like charging for things that used to be free!
Thousands of dollars and the kids' favorite part was just hanging out! How ridiculous.
I remember when my dad used to get $25 tickets in the 80s.
Please explain how affording groceries has gotten better. The producers in her ear had to sneak that one in.  “News” 😂
All of our family swore we would NEVER do anything Disney ever again. Our time there a few months ago was awful. Overpriced, overcrowded. Everyone thee was so miserable. Kids crying waiting in line forever. Spent most time dodging oversized strollers. A total waste of money. It used to be great goi g to Disney. So sad to see what has happened to it.
We only spend about $40-50 in diesel. We pack lunches and have annual passes.
You couldn't pay me to go there or Disneyland😂
And that’s why I never go.
I was quoted by Tui 🇬🇧 to stay at Disneyland Paris for only two nights for myself and my son that it would come too around £3.500. That's without buying gifts, etc.
If that's the price for Florida residents, how much are tourists paying?
Dad's eyes began to water up at the very end..👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
Disney the subliminal park of puke.  Maybe research their posters with sexual imagery all over them.
What's hilarious about this whole post is... if you don't want to go or spend the money... Don't. Disney dominates the theme park industry year after year after year. Whether you like it or not, people love the parks. If you don't, go do what you enjoy. Don't go and then look for sympathy on the internet.
craig is a swindler used car dealer from new hampshire who screws people out of their money and owns millions in cars, luxury homes, etc.  He cries with two loaves of bread under each arm.  the last of anyone who should complain about prices.
It’s not worth it anymore.
Weird we spend spend 3.5k for a whole week staying at their resort.
This news report was actually made 20 years ago 😂
It's simple, BOYCOTT !!!!
Well he bought American and it costed him.... get ready for that to be an everyday thing
I actually looked because I honestly thought it was going to be more.
People, go to other places with your kids!
I paid totally $1432 for five tickets n parking ticket n food n other stuff in Disneyland here in California
The Mouse has the appetite of an elephant.
News person… nothing better… have you checked your 401k
yes with interview experience, to be in the news, thats new!! a disney experience they will never forget 😂
Most of us who live here, don’t go to Disney .
If I suddenly able to afford a day trip or two to Disney right now people will probably think I'm selling drugs or something. Because there's no way I should be able to afford 1000 dollar trip to anywhere.

Going to Disney is NOT penny pinching
Jajaja and the think the girl like the most wast the line 😂 no disney 😂😂❤
Take the kids to the neighborhood park
As I learned in the first town playing Dragon Age Origins, it is the consumer who sets the price. The willingness of many paying these prices will not cause anything to get less expensive.
Being able to afford kids nowadays and give them happy memories is so expensive. I'd feel guilty not being able to take them out to see the world and have fun.
There are many many other theme parks in florida that are more affordable and still very fun
They have been crazy for awhile. Disney needs to get it together. It sad I will not be going any time soon. Price Joke
Nobody pinching pennies goes to Disneyland.
Just don't go!  Problem solved
Thanks for the report! As if we in Canada needed another reason not to visit Florida!😂😂
I'm looking forward to Clownfish tv's video on this.
Got a little bit better?! 😂 Nice save there Fox.
At first I thought this was the Onion.  Man was I disappointed that this was just a serious attempt at "news".
We just went to Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, to save money from the high prices at Disney.  We were able to get the tickets for under $100 per person online. However the parking was $40 per day and soft drinks were almost $7 for a 20 oz bottle. The food was around $20 per person for a combo. Maybe not quite as high as disney, but still high!  We also had a few rides and animals that were not available.  That was the most disappointing part.
2:15 News anchor couldn't help herself but to bring in her unwanted opinion on politics. APPALLING
I knew that 10 years ago and decided it’s better to spend the money for overseas trips instead. Kids love traveling outside of US and no one asked for Disney.
Disney needed to somehow make up for the failing woke movie business!
I think Disneyland is more expensive!! I paid almost $250 per ticket a couple of days ago
"Ya I wanted to make a viral video so i decided to spend an absurd amount of money and pretend to be shocked that I chose willingly to spend that much so I can go viral when I complain about it on the tik toks" man this world is pathetic
Yup, it's not for middle-class families anymore.
"It's gotten a little bit better", really? Do you want a doll at Disney or do you want to go college? That's what I hear a lot lately
EXPENSE PAEDO PARK!🤔🇺🇸SKIP
The economy has gotten better under the current Admin?!😂😂😂. That’s a joke.  Show the bias.  But if you can’t afford groceries you have no need to be going to Disney
Never went to Disney growing up occasionally every year we would go to a local amusement park but even then it was never as expensive as Disney.
America, please make sure to teach your kids how to be a best consumer for the big corporations 😂😂😂😂
It isn't about making it affordable for family anymore like it should be it's about pricing everyone out but the rich. Time to force a change.
Disney is expensive and in other news: water is wet, the sun rises in the east, and bears poop in the woods.
Even as an annual pass holder this is ridiculous
Yes, Disney is expensive, but the dude was not making choices to keep costs down. All that alcohol, buying bottled water (you can get a cup of ice water for free), and a sit-down meal for five people?!  Also, he misunderstood the whole Lightning Lane concept. It's not three rides total for the day. It's three reservations at a time. You book three, and as soon as you use one of your rides, you can book a different ride as long as they are available.  I am not defending Disney and its high costs, but you have to research everything before you set foot in the park. Look at park trends like crowd calendars for your day to attend. Look up restaurants and their prices. Pack snacks and lunches if you can. See what merch you can buy outside the park. As one Disney vlogger puts it: If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.
Cheaper to go to Disney in Japan including the flights.
Walt must be spinning in his grave 😱😱😱
Stay away from woke, Liberal disney!!!!!!!
This is not news…
Disney is like college - way overpriced, and every non-thinking parent was somehow convinced you're bad if you don't send your kids there.
Did he think that it was free?😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
this is so sad
Not for me.   I hope that my children are not traumatized by never being taken to Disney.
Not worth it
I've only been once. Traveling outside the country is much cheaper.
No pay no play
The news reader had to mention “ UNDER THE LAST ADMINISTRATION “ for no reason in this segment. How about you do a story and keep it real for once !!
Why are you bringing up the last administration as if cost of living hasn’t gone up since 47
Why is this news? Everyone knows it’s expensive to go.
HELLLLLL.....NOOO
Disney has completely lost its magic
He is aware that Disney World on average for at least a family of two to three is $6,000 so he's complaining about $1,000 he got it good he had it very cheap
As a Florida resident, I have no desire to visit any of the parks. $1400 would just about buy a small jon boat that I could use for a long time. Don't be Goofy, and go elsewhere.
Guess I won't ever go. Good god😮
get used to it . . trump will only make things worse . . you morons elected a moron .
Thats cheap for 1day espically at disneyworld😂 what you paid for 1 day will get you atlease 3 at disneyland in california. Theres ways you can go cheap asf this guy just trynna make it worse then it is😂plus im bettin the parents or atlease he works and plus there tik tok or social media income they really making it worse then it truely is😂😂😂😂
Disney sucks, no surprise
Rip off American way
They will never see a dollar of my money anymore. It shouldn’t cost this much to take your kids to have fun.
its not for the poors
The world is too crowded! No matter what you do or where you go it’s packed. Those government incentives to have children 20 years ago it’s corruption.
Most magical place on earth❌ Most expensive place on earth✅
Work colleague from australia just came back from taking his family,kids and grandkids to disneyland,cost him $250.000 for a weeks stay,something that was booked and paid for a year ago.
😅😅😅 day? Try week!
Why is he acting surprised? Sounds about right. Just stop going lol
Has gotten alil better ??????
The entire place is my idea of hell on earth!
Her answer of what her favorite part of Disney was shows where the real value is. Could’ve saved $1,400 or used it for something else for family.
If you keep going, then do not complain.  If you do not agree, then do not go!  As long as people going, Disney will continue to increase price.  It is a business!
I wouldn't pay Disney ANY money with all their woke BS.  Not one cent!
2:14 The lying liars lie.  She can't even admit that the economy under the felon is very poor.
I won't be able to go for 4-5 years. Even after my family saves up I don't think it will be enough anyways. They have literally priced the average family out and is becoming an almost high luxury that most families are not going to ever enjoy or go see.
200 per person+ tax. Sounds like a good night out.
All this for pleasure, no necessary,,Disney changed Florida ,not for good
Never ever went to Disneyland, never ever will. No reason for me to support corporate greed at Disney.
Dude lives in Florida, I find it hard to believe he was shocked by the price.
100% tariff on Disney now !
Mickey Mouse Stupid Tax
I get that the amount is exorbitant.  There are choices:  go to Disney or not.  Some preplanning and critical thinking of the costs are necessary here.
It’s supposed to be for children, yes?😂😂😂
Too expensive and frustrating an experience .. be prepared to always be on the stupid phone to navigate your experience. Not magical or relaxing or entertaining unless actually riding  ect..which takes alot of effort.  you have to expensively work for your hot and expensive and exhausting experience
The answer is EASY: STOP GOING TO DISNEY. They are far too entitled at this stage. PURE GREED
People can barely afford to live, and then if you want to take your kids to the soldier's called magical kingdom. You have to take out a second mortgage.
doing disney for five days would be crazy, thank goodness you made it through one day😅
Kendall’s response was heartwarming, you’ve raised a fine daughter sir!!
It's sad because most kids will never get to go.
It's expensive to stand in line in the heat. I did it once when my daughter was younger.
Ridiculous!
Disney For Them .  Silver Dollar City For Us  .
The US=a corporation and Oligarchy. And every corporation wants more $$ each year.  Disney and all the corporations want more $ yearly. Corporations are not patriotic or think in the average Joe. Their goal is clear=profit maximization.
Isn't he Craig, the YouTuber car dealer from New Hampshire (Flying Wheels)?
For a lot less than $1,400, I can think of endless ways to spend a special day with my family.
He should work more
Never would I take my family .....
I grew up in California, in Los Angeles. I went to Disneyland once to take my two kids, you know, give them the experience. Never went back even if that was a time before the grifting and gouging
So, the things are better now that Biden is out, what country do you live in?
That was such a sweet response towards the end. That in itself is priceless. You did well, Dad ❤
I stopped cold when I found out it's $200 just to get in the gate and that's per person per day.
Corporate greed feeds on people not thinking about how they spend their money...
Disney will never get another dime from me
Taking my kids to Thailand, way better.
lol!!!  So this is Biden’s fault too…..you people!!😂😂
Disney sucks and it is the Gulf of Mexico.
It is true greed
We can’t always give our kids everything they want. I would rather spend that money towards my child’s education and take them camping for the weekend.
Just wait until the Trump tariffs hit and make souvenirs and food double in cost.
lol grocery has not gotten a lil better lmao GTFO
Need to abolish capitalism now
Don't pay! 900 for tickets, I would not be going.
How could he not know???? Everyone in the world knows it is expensive. People plan months in advance to do packages to save money.
He’s lying it is not $974 for 5 tickets to Disney Florida resident tickets are $119 each for a 1 day ticket so it should be $595
But yet they still went thru the gate....
Did she really say things are cheaper now then under the Biden Administration? Listen I voted for Trump but even I did a spit take on that remark
It’s very expensive. My husband is a Manager at Disney and one day we spent $600. We got in for free and parking was free also. The food and souvenirs were the most expensive.
Per hour, much cheaper than NFL games.
This just in:   Disney World costs money to get in and enjoy.  Now back to Armando with today's sports updates.
1300 to do a few rides.... crazy
Dont simp for them lmfao. They literally hav a youtube  plaque and hav ABSOLUTELY made their day at disney they were complaining abt back and then some. 🤣🤣🤣
Haha they are using kids to finasse the parents money. Then when people dont want kids and there population reduces they say "Its the mozlems breeding program"
I have a six year old grandson who asked about Disney world. I told him it was closed and we were going to go see some great waterfalls nearby.
Ever since universal studios bought them they been hella greedy
It must have been cheap in the 80's because my dad would have never paid them kinda prices.
Isn’t it crazy how when Disneyland first opened admission literally was only $1 a ticket  after Walt died man’s greed really kicked in.    Money truly is evil we are living a horror movie at this point
Who's shocked by this?  Disney has been expensive since the 2000s (probably earlier but that's the time i started paying for it)
I'm shocked that he's shocked!! 😂 People keep paying exorbitant amounts of money & going to these places which have very little to offer anymore. You actually couldn't pay ME enough to ever go to a place like that. No, thank you 🤮💩
Disney is WOKE so I will never go there.
Trump said instead of 30 or 39 or 32 lightsabers you might just need to be happy with 1 or 5 or 3.
Would be same if they went to Universal but nobody states that. You Americans get on Disney cause DeSantis and Trumpy hate them.😊
Disney has ties to EPSTEIN PEDOPHILIA.....LOOK INTO IT.
We need to go strike wit them  Disney  some family’s can’t even go beaches it’s to high some in that park is pocketing money Disney is a big scam and you have to wait hours to just ride one ride
Go to dollar store beforehand and bring ur own snacks. One day sounds ridiculous if flying. Way too much fatigue. Two days is good. Put money aside for extras, common sense dictates it ain't cheap.
Absolutely a Rip off.
Why is this news?   Its not like he didn't know the cost of all this stuff before he went.  So, he goes, knowing the costs, spends the money, and then gets online and complains about the price.
Also, you have a lot of kids bro.
Ya it’s a rip off we take are kid there for them and we have to pay a lot every time we go there easy 9k  they need to get in trouble on top of that the air flight is a rip too
"they'll never forget it"... Come on now!
It’s not just Disney…ever take a family of 4 skiing/snowboarding? Just as expensive
Well when they make movies like Snow White, they gotta make money somehow.
It amazes me people just keep living their life like the prices are the same .Boycott stop spending the high prices
Crazy part is the parks keep everything else afloat they lose money on movies and shows and Disney plus, but make so much on the park side. In CA they raised prices and keep raising them to keep ghetto people out, whenever they have a sale on tickets all the sudden there are fights in the park. I’m for raising prices if it keeps troublemakers out
I will charge only 5 dollars to give you a wait in line experience so families can connect 😂
$954 dollar tickets for a family of 5 with access to 4 different parks sounds reasonable to me. Unless I'm missing something?
That’s actually cheaper then I thought it would be I was thinking double that
average length of MLB game: 3 hours. average cost of a seat at a Tampa Rays game: 96$ - X 5= 480. (best seats are more like $400. X 5!!) 5 drinks and 5 snacks - who knows? $80? parking? $15?  - $575 for 3 hours of watching someone else do something.  Disney parks and others are open maybe 12 hours a day for the customer to engage in activities. And thats the Rays. Yankees? Mets? Red Sox? Chicago Blackhawks? Golden State Warriors? Green Bay Packers? Have you been to a Broadway show? How much does one seat there cost for about 3 hours entertainment? $700? $1,000? I have no dog in this fight - just hate when people want to sensationalize out of context.
Dad was the best part of interview
This is news?
Why does she lie and say the cost of s*** has gotten a little bit better under the new Administration has anybody watched the video of President Reagan on tariffs?! Like what the fuc?!🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮😡😡🤬🤬
Anything Disney SUCKS!!! 👿👺🤮
Kids don't need to be entertained.  They need to mow their lawn and clean their rooms. Parents are dumb.
lol you didn’t check it out first, duh
You can’t convince me Americans are struggling and suffering from inflation. They’re still traveling, going on vacation, wasting money they DO have.
Mr Iger's Bonus Depends on YOU!
Inflation is out of control and housing is unaffordable, unfortunately the people who are in positions to do something about these things don't care.
Disney doesn’t want your business. We are beginning to see the great divide in this country where companies realize the middle class is disappearing. Disney has decided it is more profitable to have one family pay $10,000 for a trip, than it is to have 3 families pay $1,500 for a trip. They are intentionally pricing outthese middle class families so they can pursue the high earning families. This is just the beginning. The middle class is dying. You will soon have two types of companies in this country. Ones that service the uber rich like Disney, and ones that service the low income earners like little Caesar’s. There will be no in between
had gone to DisneyWorld in high school (Grad Night), and then again in college (in the 80s).  Didn't go again til around 2019 (DisneyLand).  MUCH more expensive.  What got me was the family t-shirts that said "Best Day Ever"...  and the dad's t-shirt always said "Most Expensive Day Ever".
3 cheers for Trump 😂
WOW! NEVER WENT, PROBLY NEVER WILL. TRAVEL CAMPING IS MUCH BETTER AND FUN.
This is the reason that we no longer go.
Stop going and watch them prices fall 😂
This girl answered “waiting in lines” as her favorite part? Ohh that makes Disney look real good.
This is not food. It was the family choice. Disney cost too much but this family is entitle.
Meanwhile, you can buy a National Park for $50 which allows you to go for a YEAR and see God’s beautiful creation. Just saying.
He’d be better off taking his kids to the beach or a museum, anything else. That’s so much money,my parents paid that much I’d insist we’d go out to dinner or a movie or something.
You choose to pay.  No one forced you to go, if you can’t afford a trip then don’t go or at least stop bitching.
I hate Disney, my girlfriend loves Disney. I enjoy myself when i go, but it’s never worth it.  She started coming around to the idea of boycotting Disney, at least until they stop with the liberal propaganda they pump.  But I never want to go again.
Stop paying them you DA’s.
I call BS on his $1k for 5 tickets.. he must have also purchased the fast pass for each ticket.. Disney tickets are expensive but not $200 and locals get them even cheaper.. and I want to know what they ordered for lunch.  $230 for 5 and 3 of them being kids???  Why did they not pack their lunch into the park? That’s what we do…
Epic Universe is about to clean Disney’s clock for a short time while the park is new. Disney looks dated in some ways in my opinion.
As a long-time fan of Disney World, I find it sad that the average family cannot afford to go.  Another great sadness for me is: 1. Changing Splash Mountain for political/social reasons only 2. Getting rid of Tom Sawyer Island, Rivers of America, and the Riverboat ride.  These made the Magic Kingdom unique to other theme parks, and provided a link to the Walt-inspired rides of the past.  I've always felt that to make a park a success, it needed to provide something different than other parks.  Also, they had land available to put the new rides.   3. WDW and Disney in general should stay out of politics and social issues, and stick to just providing us the peaceful environment that made WDW unique and successful.  It used to be a place people could go to get away from all the chaos and schisms of our society and just enjoy a peaceful time.  No longer.   I believe Bob Iger put it best: "We're in the business to entertain, not to make statements".   Just my opinion, but I miss the "traditional" WDW. God Bless!
I refuse to give them my money!  The last time I went to Disneyland in CA was the early  90s and it was $25 for the day.   I grew up going there and remember the diff tickets 🎟️ A-E that came in a book until they changed it to one fee. The amount they charge nowadays is ludicrous
It's a shame they keep their prices a secret...
Disney is immoral anyways. Back in the day it was good stuff. Since Walt has been gone so have the morals. I would give them a dime
He had to have known the price before he went. If you can’t afford it don’t go. You can call them and find all the prices before you go.
spent the money  an yet complaining  real smart !  maby re think life choices
Yet, knowing all this, people still go and pay. It's actually laughable that visitors expect more when the whole world tells them otherwise.
It's not a vacation. And he did this for views.
For those critical of the young girl's response to reporter's question at 3:14 she had to come up with an answer on the fly. Nothing was really prepared for her to say, and she wasn't really prepped beforehand. I'm sure she liked some stuff in the park that she couldn't readily name or immediately articulate, but her on-camera answer was sweet and genuine.
Are you from Mars?  If you're going to whine about it, then don't go to Disney.  How stupid can you be not knowing it's going to cost a lot.
Lol, $1,400 for 5 for a full day is not bad. $280/person/day would be your max. He knows if they did multiple days then yeah, that number would be lower. And there is no Florida resident savings on a single park day.  Looked and planned one for 4 adults and 2 kids for 9 days. $300/person/day roughly. That includes a VRBO, tickets to each Disney World park and one day at the two Universal parks, car rental, flights and food. For 5 people, would be $1,500 a day which includes the VRBO, flights and additional tickets. So yeah, this guy did something wrong to get $1,400/person as a Florida resident. Just because someone can't budget correctly, doesn't mean something is expensive. And on top of that, Disney has always been a luxury vacation. Not some vacation that every single family should be able to take.
Well yeah Einstein you gotta stay for more than a day.
Easy way to fix that problem don’t go 😂
Try travelling from Scotland for 2 weeks!
A while ago, we took a taxi from our off-site motel to the Magic Kingdom's "drop-off zone" at the TTC.  They charged us for parking.  Being appalled, we immediately went to Guest Services who explained that only Mears Taxis have free access to their drop area.  After remaining calm (it wasn't the CM's fault), we asked to chat with a supervisor, and got our money back.  This took one hour of our day, just to get inside the gates.  That was 2004.  We haven't been back.
This has been the since 2014-ish. Both Disney and Universal Studios have priced out the middle class. It’s terrible.
Pay a small fortune just to get on a few rides.
Not the last administration!! Insane news reporting.
The best part was waiting in line because she got time to spend time with her family. That’s sad, and bad parenting. They could have stayed home or gone to the park. Dad, all your daughter wants is time with you. Feel sorry for the family. Well, it wasn’t all a waste; dad get time on Fox. Spend time with you kids, take them to the library.
Dad isnt smart for not knowing that walking in.
Still cheaper than the inflation price converted from 80s and early 90s when the park was really expensive then to. Its not your normal amusment park or parks as you well know. It aint HERSHEY, Six Flags, Kings Dominion, Cedar Point and so on. So your not gonna get those prices. You wanna visit the best in the world, prices aren't gonna be convenient for everyone to go. If it was everyone you talk to on the street wouldve been there already. Those parks DISNEY(Epcot,Animal Kingdom,Hollywood Studios,Magic Kingdom), UNIVERSAL Studios & Island of Adventure, "NEW" UNIVERSAL EPIC, SEAWORLD and everything else in that area is the FERRARI, LAMBERGINI, McLaren of park entertaintment. You want the KIA, Ford, Toyota, Jeep type level PARK and price range for an experience, go somewhere else. That simple.
That’s sound rite, I went in 2008.
lol let me guess this is Joe biden's fault
" its a bit better since the last administration" yeah right..!
You all need to stop saying it’s corporate greed.. stop complaining about Disney prices.. no way anyone should be surprised about the cost of taking a family to Dland. Disney sets their prices based on what the market is willing to pay.. my family of 6 went to the world last summer, it was not cheap but we knew that going in so we saved money where we could.. here’s an example; Disney allows you to bring food and drinks into the park, but most folks don’t do that.. I saw lines 20 folks deep just buying a bottle water or soda for 4x what they would have paid if they bought outside the park..
Just don’t go! Go to the park! Have a lost boys party at the park or playground.
We paid $694 to get into Universal Studios, just to get in!!!! Ridiculous!
THANKS FOR THE INFO, 😮THAT'S CRAZY 😢
Dads not to smart is he 😂😂😂😂
Gotta make up for all those losses the studios have been taking!
asking a kid if its worth it..... kid has no concept of money... never worked a day in her life.... brain dead question fox.
The reason people cant afford to go to Disney is because of the last administration 😂 good old fox will never change i guess !
Stay home eat ramen lol
Trump’s economy😂
The best time to take a trip to Disney Land is in the WINTER! EVEN A DRIZZEL IS COMFORTABLE, at least in CA.
Dad look sad hahahaha
Abigail Disney, the grand niece of Walt, made a documentary called The American Dream and Other Fairytales. She talks about how greed took over and destroyed her family's legacy and original plan for the park to be for everyone and employees to be treated with dignity and respect.
Oh gosh, Craig is always looking for camera time! Get crying wheels outta here!! I’m his #1 hater 😂
Disney is honestly for the rich. Back in the day late 70s and 80s were way different . I can’t believe when  they were Florida residents still so expensive
These are first world problems. If you can’t afford rent don’t go to Disney. There are much more affordable alternatives.
I love his daughter’s answer on how she loved being in line with her family.  Priceless. Just priceless. You go girl 🎉
Notice How she said under the last administration.  Don’t think Biden had tariffs  like Cheeto does now.  Biden has zero to do with setting prices at Disney world.   Trump either.
I am not a Disney fan BUT You spent your time & money the wrong way. You clearly got a park hopper ticket for just ONE day which is the most expensive way to do it. Cheaper would have been: Focus on your favorite park for $119 per person. Bring in WATER for gosh sakes - we live in CA and always do that wherever we go. You can even bring in snacks and then splurge on “favorite food” for a meal or visa versa. You could have then bought a plastic lightsaber from an outside of park vendor and been 1/2 the price! People can still go. You just have to not do it the most expensive way.
Disney has always fleeced families.
I don't feel sorry for this guy at all. It''s pretty much common knowledge that the cost to get into Disneyland/Disney World has been crazy expensive for a long time now. Not to mention the cost of food and lodgings. The ultimate tourist trap and a total ripoff. Of course, it has gotten even worse since Covid as with everything else, but Disney has become a textbook example of corporate greed to the extreme. As long as people continue to pay their ridiculous prices they will never come down. Vote with your wallet, folks, and spend your money elsewhere.
Disney is a rip-off
$1,000 to walk in the door. For one day.  Soooooo many better ways to vacation with family. Disney has lost its mind.
Yes, if you keep paying they will "never" lower the price.
Idiot.
The part that moved me was when she said she got to talk to her family while in line..  meaning everyone has their noses in their cell phones
Every dad across the multiverse feels your pain bro.
Meanwhile the childless millennial is having a blast at disney parks.
In 1972 it cost a total of $50 to take myself and three kids to Disneyland including food. I still have a 'B' ticket left over.
The Minnie Mouse ears on “Dad” explains the problem. So many Americans worship the Mouse…
Everything is so expensive
Even though I have never been to Disneyworld, I am in no hurry to visit the place because it soo expensive. Going to Disneyworld has become a major rip off.
New Hampshire is cheaper! Lol
Yet it’s crowded…
I went to Cabo in 2017 and had the best time of my life, all inclusive 7day for just under 1200$. Not sure how safe it is to go there rn. I know there are plenty of places to go for a similar experience for around the same price give or take a couple hundred due to rising cost (I’m no expert on inflation) I watched one video where this guy stayed with his partner at Disney Rivera in a studio for the same amount of money it would cost to go to the actual Rivera😂 it’s a joke. I like the way Disney maintains their parks and resorts but man it’s beyond what any normal family can afford now. Greed will fail in the long run. I’ve worked for greedy people and people that treat employees well. Usually the ones that treat employees and customers well win in the long run time and time again.
"under the last administration" lol, she is saying it's better now? She's delusional, but never misses a chance to make a dig.
Why go to Disney when you can go to six flags or Universal studios. The rides are sooo much better and it costs a fraction of the price you pay at Disney. Plus at Disney you will just be standing in line for most of the time anyway.
Go to the one in Japan.  It's a million times better.. and cheaper.
First of all, you should stay on property, you don´t have to pay for parking, second of all, Hollywood Studios has a lot of GREAT quick service options also, you are trying to say that you day at Disney was a trip? One day to a park is not a trip so I don´t know how that got into your head.
Take em to Disney in Japan. It's way cheaper!
Kendall likely said “I don’t Care how much you spent… I have boundaries. I’m not wearing that.” keep that same energy as you grow up girl!!😂
Ohh, left in shock!😮😢. What people needs to do is DO NOT ENTER the park and protest against the ridiculous prices. But.....if you pay them is all on you. Don't cry cause you deserve it!
I was there two months ago. I'm old and standing in line for an hour for a ride is not worth the trip. Lunch was close to 150.00 for 2 adults and one child both days. Way to many people.
Those who are saying corporate greed…. This guy is doing the same promoting his channel with tshirt and background….. he is doing same …
So sweet that she said she simply enjoyed hanging with her family at the lines.
I would have taken my kids camping instead and taught them how to make a homemade stove and then I would teach them how to build a fort to survive in.  Dirt is cheap and effective and it makes people happy.
Did this guy wake up from a 25 year coma and decide to go to Disneyland?  These are the prices and have been.  Everyone pays them.  Why is this such a shock to people.  It’s a corporate ran amusement park.  Guess what? It’s expensive.
Everyone knows the cost. Quit bitching or do something else.
We took our family to Disney back in 2005, stayed at the campground in our 5th wheel.  It was horribly crowded back then and expensive.  The best part of the entire trip was the beautiful campground on the lake.  Just had to be careful when walking the dog that the alligators didn't get her.
Crazy... and the employees make minimum wages.
Demand and supplies! I honestly think is cute, however I rather take my family to a zoo or a nice park. There we can all learn something 😊
Annnnd that’s why we’re all migrating to Universal Studios epic universe May 22. I hope Disney is shaking in their boots because this is ridiculous especially in these hard times with the tariff stuff and economy being not so good. We need a place to go to to let our hair down and bring back our happiness.
Jesus, a day trip to Europe is $300 for a family of 4
Is a trip to Disney World expensive and often super busy, yes.  Is this a surprise to anyone that has not been living under a rock, no.  This guy is either ignorant on the costs associated with Disney or looking for clicks/views.  Even with the high costs, the crowds prove people are willing to spending their hard earned money on going to Disney.   If you want a better value, go to Universal Studios.  Although with the new Harry Potter park opening up, I expect huge crowds for the next few months.
yeah, but sometimes it seems like the people that can't afford it also have more bad behaviors that will ruin the vibe.
This extortion is totally ridiculous! The average family cannot afford Disney! Corporate greed out of control!
omg so Disney is cheaper now that Trump is back, lol that was under the last admin. come on Fox.
This is pure corporate, American greed. This is what capitalism looks like.
Kendall's zaddy is HOT 🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈
Disney is high-end amusement. We have 10s of thousands of amusement parks in America that would love your business and children will enjoy. I took my kids from local parks, traveling festivals, kiddie lands, bouncy gyms, Six Flags to Disneyland. From my perspective all were different from their perspective little difference and had fun at all places.
Disnay can kiss it. They have gone off the rails with woke, living wage and greed. Glad I went to both in the 80's.
Welcome to Trumps economy! 🤣
Lol, way to make your family feel guilty for having fun. Like he didn't know exactly how much this day would cost. This guy can afford a day at Disney, be grateful.
Haven't been to disneyland in over 20 years and at that time the cost was ridiculous not to mention waiting in line for hours just to get on a ride. I remember when you received a booklet with tickets inside. I believe C tickets were for the big rides.. Remember thinking they should get rid of them and let people ride as many times as they want. Well now I understand those tickets and wish we could go back to them....😊
Of course the daughter would say its worth it.  It cost the daughter ZERO
I see he has a YT channel. The clicks and likes will pay for it I think
I'm sure Walt is rolling over. When a place charges that much for entry and nickle & dime inside the park... they should never charge for parking. As large as that parking "continent" is there. In 2015 parking was Free.99.
What a sweet daughter 😊
He's rich he doesn't relate to living paycheck to paycheck
it cost me over $1,300 dollars for a 3 day trip last month to Texas from Massachusetts to receive timely medical care. Substandard hotels, cheapest flight, cheapest rental car, skipped meals. 1.3k.
300 a head for day run to Disney?     That doesn’t really sound outrageous…….leave half the kids at home next time?
Lol waiting in line is free.
*Lands on Earth "Wow disney is expensive"
Makes me think abt ppl’s experiences of buying fancy toys for their kids, & then seeing the kids hvg more fun w the empty box. 😝  We didn’t hv fancy toys when I was little, but we sure did hv fun w empty boxes’ 😂
Cheaper to go to Europe to be honest
This is why people are so angry when they are at Disney, it costs a pile of money and it is still crowded.
Disney is a scam and its overrated I would never go.
Disneyland is nothing but a dream now ,what a waste of time now 🤢🤮
Don't forget all the extra Gratuity you need to pay mandatory on all drinks and food you purchase.
I dont do disney for my child.  She doesnt even know anything disney or its existence.
Disney is NOT WORTH IT ANYMORE!  Go to Universal!
I had to sell my left nut to buy water inside the parks 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hey! Flying Wheels! Love the channel. I'd buy a car from that guy.
It hasn't gotten a little bit better - it's gotten worse. I love the way Faux News tries to spin things to try to appease the MAGAs. And it's going to get MUCH worse as a result of Trump's dumb tariffs. Good thing they went now. Probably won't be able to afford to again for a very long time.
Disney , once a juggernaut of entertaiment company built by visionary genius creatives now taken over by bunches of creativity bankrupt activist
No getting around TrumpFlation.
No way I'd give these demons my money.
It was $35 to park at SeaWorld San Diego, so honestly $30 to park at Disney is the only “reasonable” price they have 😭😭
The irony is that if it was cheaper, the lines would be two or three times longer, and the whole park would be packed. I’m sure this is one of the ways they gage prices. I hate it, but it is what it is.
It sounds like he got a deal... I'm going to Disneyland next week. Four people, for two days, lighting lane and parking for $1,646.
I bet that father felt LIBERATED at Disney..
That's cheap! Usually a trip to Disney World costs just one person upwards of $6000+  if you really want to enjoy the full experience!
Take your kids to the park and have a nice picnic. Entertainment enough
What’s the problem? You can’t put a price on Magic 🪄
The biggest ripoff on planet Earth.
Yup insane !!! Way too expensive !!!
As a 90"s Decade Born person , Its such a honour to be born at Disney Rennaisance era in such decade where an era full of critically succeful aclaimed hits that both commercialy and financially but now as growing up , i becoming more distaste with their business practice direction
Disney World was suppose to be a greatest park there is, my family and I went there like two times, was planning on going there myself again but nope, all no thanks to the biden regime for doing that and those corrupt political donkey aggressor jackasses.🤡
Disney is overcharging people 🙄
It’s gonna take a long time for President Trump to UNFU*K this country from sleepy Joe’s buffoonery and allowing corporate greed like this!
If you can’t afford it just say that
Y’all doing Disney vacations are insane.  I won’t even do Dollywood now it’s so high.
We did my honeymoon for universal. Cheaper
They have destroyed what was once and incredible place.  They have replaced the experience for profit and Mr. Disney would be ashamed.
Disney is and always was the biggest American rip-off ever foisted on the paying public suckers who go there
Shouldn't be a surprise. It's been pricey for a while
so sad they could have stayed at home and talked instead of spending time in line), kids need their parents not some made up character:(
Pinching Pennie’s is not going to Disney.
It’s packed so they keep raising prices, supply and demand. At some point it will even out is the hope.
Bozo 'dad' is still promoting Disney (with the Minnie Mouse ears) een after they just ripped him off.  Disney is evil....but that idiotas 'dad' got what he deserved.
what a waste of money
I was in Florida a few years ago, and able to go to Orlando for the first and probably only time in my life. I had always wanted to go as a kid but my parents could never swing it. I did go to Disneyland quite a few times though. Anyways, I went early and tried to do as much as I could in one day. I was flabbergasted at the cost and almost thought about leaving, but paid it anyways for a park hopper ticket. I did have fun, but to this day still question if it was worth it. Later I went to Universal Orlando and had twice the fun for a fraction of the cost.
Pretty sad Americans can’t even enjoy their own country anymore. I’m going to Wally world
Thanks trump
Family of 5… $1400 seems about right. Lunch, drinks, parking, snacks, ticket rides, souvenirs and dinner
Disney was so much fun when I was a kid in the early 2000s. Unfortunately, it's become sooo expensive to the point where we cannot afford it. And we are considered upper middle class. So instead we go to places like Ireland, Scotland, London... for domestic trips we went to Colorado Springs.... lots of fun each of them and wayyy more affordable than Disney. Even 1 day at Disney is too much.
Disney world and Disneyland sucks!
I didn't know Craig the car guy moved from New Hampshire. The shock and awe must have thrown his wallet for a loop!
Duh! Didn't he know that already, especially living in Florida.  Now that I think about it, the real reason for him to post that video, is for it to get 136 million trillion views, so he could make money off of it!  I should have made some thing like this too... next time.
Mebbe you should have gone CAMPING😊
3:11 Truth is. Your time is worth way more value than what you spend when it comes to little children.
if youre upset about the cost, dont go to disney world, they will reduce price if demand falls, thats why tokyo disney only cost $50
Yea I'll stick with universal and plan disney a few years in advance.
We grew up with annual passes to CA Disney, it was actually affordable. Now 1 day costs more than the year pass. Haven't been in over 20 yrs, don't plan to ever go again. Why would anyone want to support a company who allows that racist trash talk show The View to remain on air? 🙄
It's Craig from Flying Wheels. Woo woo.
I’ll save you the trip to Disney, It literally consists of standing in line for hours an only riding max about 4 rides
I've lived in Florida for 10 years. I've visited 1 Disney Park once.
Maybe don’t take your kids? Lmaoo 🤷🏻‍♂️
That's about par for the course, you clown. I'm not saying whether it's value for your money, but I've taken my family to Disney for 5-7 days and it comes to almost $20,000. So I'd say you're coming in under budget.
3:21 Genuinely, I was not expecting that response, but it was authentic.   As we can see, even the dad was surprised. Bravo to her for seeing the beauty of time with loved ones. 👏
1k for tickets alone is ludicrous
I wouldnt waste my time going to disney.  Its not worth the money.
For 4 people that's about right
Talk about bs media....most Americans for years can't afford to go to Disney World. Lady then lies and says the economy is getting better. Pure delusion smh.
It's not like republicans care. Most American families are living check to check....Republicans and their voters love that hard working class people are suffering and struggling. Their voting records prove they hate working class people just as much as the democrats.
Stay home. There’s a reason I don’t vacation on the French Riviera, or on a yacht… Take your kids to Chuck E. Cheese if that’s your budget. 🤷‍♂️
That’s why i never went … THIS WAS A DAY TRIP ???!!! Not even a three day weekend  ?!
Ridiculous, this is why I will never visit Disney. I don’t see Disney surviving long at this rate. Maybe trump will put a tariff on Disney
1400$ and her favorite part was waiting in line talking? They can do that for free at home! That’s sweet but a little odd 😂
Kendall had an impossible. Either she were the Minnie Mouse ears on public television. Or she stood next to her dad who were them on public access television.who knows if there is a right choice.😅
The subtle little dig at the last administration; I forgot I was watching Fox. 😂
what a horrible reporter
Disney is like that one dipshit landlord who overcharges on a trailer.
Stay at home if you can’t afford it!!!!
The "magic" in Magic Kingdom is just another term for "money".
Waiting in line and talking with family was her favorite part. Baby we would have been waiting in line at the state fair for a fraction of the cost 😂
Disney is turning into a one and done experience. After 7 trips, my kids are older now and we have better places to go for the cost.
I worked as a Part time Disney employee for two years, and worked in Parking, and drove the Tram at anaheim. I talked to lots pf old employees who actually knew and talked to Walt,. They all said that if Walt was still alive, He would fire almost everyone, in management today, and prices would drop in half what they are today, and there would be NO WOKE, DEI, or homesexuals working in the park today....
Americans on paper spend $1,000 USD Received value = $$20 USD  Meanwhile a Chinese EV at only $40,000 USD is technologically superior, faster, safer and has more features than any US car at $100,000 USD price range  Fake economy
You’ve just said how long the lines were People are definitely affording to go 😂😂
Stop giving them your money
Disney has lost their minds, just dont go anymore
Boycott disney
Why was he surprised? Disney is expensive. What's your next story going to be? Man goes on cruise and discovers they're expensive.
A barbecue  in my garden, with music, beer, my kids playing around is my favorite trip. Then at night a fire pit. It cost less than 30€.
According to Trump only thing a kid need is two dolls😂
Daddy needs a better job so he can afford to splurge occasionally.
Plus, another $2-3k if you're a family of 5+ just travelling there.
Its getting Better? 😂
My wife and daughter and her sister and her kids just got back from Universal Studios in California. They said they had a blast. The lines were long but nowhere near as long as Florida. I went to Disney World in like 1998 and the lines were painfully long even back then I can’t imagine how it must be now. Also, the weather was unbearably hot as Florida usually is in the summer whereas California has fantastic weather pretty much all year around. It was also less expensive than Florida by a pretty significant margin.  Disney is well aware that foreigners from China will pay the prices without blinking. They’re allowed to charge whatever they want in the end. My question is why do you people still go?
Add Hotel in CAD/AUD $ Absolutely insanec
And this for a FL resident. Imagine for those who travels to FL or even the foreigners or worse if the foreigners are from South America as example.
They are losing SO MUCH money else where, this is recuperating from the loss
My plane Ticket from Europe to the US and back was less than that
Wow that is why I will never go to Disney world even if I win the lottery, it’s just not worth it
Family of 5 with 1 child under 5 years old = $1400 !!! Wow, that's too much really.. in Asia you can spend nice weekend in a nice family resort with also a visit to a Disneyland like park.
The strength of the US (to visit) is its parks and unknown parts of the country....as someone who has gone there many times, going to Disney was, as the video suggests, a costly lesson.
Boycott!
Coffee chocolaté, meat,  plane ticket,  vidéo games, its all about the GREED.
Fox blamed everything to Biden. Ridiculous!
These insane high prices do offer one side benefit i don't think everyone noticed  .. no wild water KINGDOM visitors there , or at least not many
F Disney!
No one pointed a gun to force you to go there, you knew ahead what you will spend for the day, stop making a fuss about it if it's over your budget 👎
Disney days are numbered.
My family and I can afford such things but we dont go to it to show that they're over pricing and we will not pay for that kind of thing. Businesses will adjust if people stop paying for such things
... stop going, how simple can it be?
I knew a guy who worked a second job so his family could go to Disney twice a year.   If that’s what you're into, great. I'll just save up money and go someplace that doesn't cost you at every turn.
Stop blaming tariffs blame the consumers! Stop buying $hit! $30 to park at a place you have tickets for already? How does that make any sense.
Disney is a machine
It's not the same...but it is a lot of fun...You can buy your family 5 silver annual passes to Busch Garden for the cost of a day at Disney.
I went there in 2010… first time since the park opened… prices then started out at $5.50 book of tickets, 2010…$104 per person…rode 3 rides so many long lines… RIP OFF
Thank God my kids weren’t into Disney.
It doesn't matter what administration is running the government. Disney has always been expensive, and it will continue to he expensive until huge number of people stop going. They're greedy and refuse to think about the average family trying to enjoy themselves.
In a story about Disney, anchor still couldn't avoid blaming previous administration. And says it's gotten a lot better now. For who exactly?😅
WHO DO WE HAVE to THANK for 💴INCREASING………🤣🤣
Why would you not calculate the cost before you go?
I live an hour from Disney in Orlando 😂 haven’t been back in over 20 years
Disney sucks
I think Disney is way overpriced and overrated, if i wanted to see 'funny characters' a trip to Walmart will do it for me! Besides i get free parking at Walmart! 😂😆🤣
lucky he could go to Disneyland, grocery and basic necessities cost through the roof. inflation keeps climbing
Never went to Dinseyland and never will.
soft man who can't say no to his family and then complains on a national level.
Yeah I'm 42 and still haven't been.
2:20 can't afford groceries under the last administration?! ...buckle up buttercup, this administration is juuuust getting started.  ...oh, the Fools of Fox
No amount of profits are enough for Disney. Give the money to your kids instead while teaching them the value of it and how to spend it wisely.
1st mistake was giving any of his money to a company that grooms children.
Seems like this was his first time there, everyone knows Disney is pricey. That’s like going into subway and being surprised you can make your own sandwich🤦🏻‍♂️😂
Everything in a theme park, including a bottle of water, has a minimum cost of $20 now. It's a couple hundred bucks per ticket, a couple hundred more for the "speed pass" you need if you want to get on any ride, $50 to park, couple hundred for the hotel, and couple hundred for food if you want to eat even a hotdog. A single day at the theme park for you and one other person now starts at a thousand dollars.
That guy can afford it 😂. Not saying these prices are right
They want to trans the kids and take your money. Don't know why anyone still goes to Disney
Im so glad my kids have zero interest in going to Disney, we live about an hour away to Yellowstone, and they LOVE going. Maybe we'll plan a trip to other national parks ❤
I would not even Go there if I’ll get free tickets!!
Disney? I just don't get it.
You all have no idea the real cost! The infection that is spread is far more costly!
If you're dumb enough to pay, it's on you.
Was it just me, or did anyone else notice that the news anchor was going on about people who can't afford groceries and bla.. bla.. bla.. then goes on about inflation.. then she gathers herself and quickly throws in "under the old administration"... there still is inflation. Must be worried that Trump will fire her lol
Do your research before you take trips. Disney is out of reach of the Masses. It is for the well to do and wealthy only.
U don't do Disney Disney does you hard no lube this is all because of greedy people who know u will pay to play a billionaire told me this a long time ago look at boardoff directors CEO pay there millions in pay a few hundred million just for them all
The little girl said it all with her favorite part being waiting in line and talking to her family!
STOP PAYING AND GOING🤦🏽‍♀️PERIOD
Got to recoup the cost of that disastrous Snow White and the Seven registered S, offenders somewhere.
The poors keep complaining…. If you can’t afford it, don’t do it
Disney is Greed Gone Wild.  Funding there Woke agenda and Satanic backing. Can't believe people who claim to be Christians are still going there.
The real magic is how quickly they can take your money, and you feel like in the end, you barely did anything.
This is news? They could have done this story on my family back in the 90s - when Disney costs were lower, but so were salaries. We took our kiddos to Disney once - they have great memories.
This is news to you idiots?
Bad father. Why would you bring your kids to woke disney?
Get bent over and fuxed.
I am a WALT DISNEY fan. Not a Disney Corporation fan. And as much as I love and grieve my trips to Disneyland, with all the evil they are doing now, I just cannot support them. Sad but true. If Disney World goes down, and it will, the Disney Corporation goes as well. Disney World is their cash cow, the jewel of the financial intake. Walt is rolling in his grave.
Oh five ticket I thought its $1000 per person per tickets, thats what I call it too expensive.
Family of 10! Cmon. Lol fox news blatant hate for Disney continues. More identity politics. What happened to supply and demand, capitalism? Keep eating it up people
Great answer Kendall. I love that u enjoyed spending time talking with ur family.
😂😂😂 didn't he checked before visiting
It's interesting how people who support free market capitalism are upset about having to pay the price for free market capitalism.
Disney as a whole has turned into a $hit Show!🤦‍♂️💆‍♂️
We still have a ticket or two with one day left on it from years ago. We probably paid a fraction of the current rate.
There was a video on Youtube where a couple calculated the new costs of going to the parks and found for a modest vacation to Disneyworld it was about the same as going to an all inclusive trip to French Riviera with promos. While a couples trip is different than families, it still eye opening of the overall costs and what it gets you.
Bring lots of hard boiled eggs (don’t forget the salt & pepper from fast food places), homemade sandwiches, juices, apples, & water to theme parks so you go home still rich😊
At this point, a trip to Disneyland is completely out of reach for anyone not living in a mansion.
Not saying Disney isn't pricey (and $1400 is $1400 no matter how you look at it), but what did he expect it would cost to take FIVE people to Disney World plus all-day meals, snacks, and a sit-down restaurant for dinner? Especially for only one day (as any theme park [let alone resort theme parks] will always charge more for single day admissions vs multiple), as he notes.   He spent an average of $280 per person, including all food. 2/3rds of that is the park admission (basically the same price as Universal), but that was probably higher than average for Disney because it was only 1 day (plus one assumes pricing is higher during summer months and near holidays). And parking, where $30 is pretty reasonable for destination sites like Disney, Universal, or sports arenas.   They spent $10/pp on lunch, which is less than it would cost to get a full meal at a movie theater, bowling alley, or performance/entertainment stadium. And another $20 total for roughly two snacks/drinks per person. Which is still pretty standard for entertainment venue snack pricing. And the rest was what sounds like a full entree and side (or appetizer) with a specialty alcoholic drink. You could go to a regular Applebees or TGIFridays and easily spent $35-45/pp for that.   Add all that up and it's a total that most people would logically expect for such an excursion. If you're looking for a cheap day outing with friends and family, you don't go to a destination resort theme park, you go to a local Six Flags park. But enjoy your theming being made almost entirely out of corrugated metal sheets instead of fully immersive worlds, because there are going to be trade-offs for the budget savings (and the snack food isn't going to be much cheaper, either).  Not to mention there ARE more cost effective ways to do Disney. He mentioned that he's a Florida resident, so, for example, it's quite possible that one of the Annual Passes would make sense for him. He'd probably pay 30% or more up-front but he'd save per trip if he came 2 or 3 times a year, plus whatever food/drink/parking discounts that come with that.   Either way, while there is clearly some sticker shock when you look at the final total, the breakdown per person for such activities really isn't that much out of the ordinary. But when you get it all at once, like, yeah, it's gonna add up.  And lastly, without intending to sound snarky (as people should be free to enjoy their trip however they want), but just as a general point that if budget is that much of an issue, maybe order some cokes, skip two of the margaritas, and buy that kid his lightsaber instead?
They could have done so many other things all summer with that money.   If you must go, buy your trinkets on International Blvd.
Disney pls I have six kids and I don’t know if I can afford to come there with my kids if this cost is too expensive lol
When disney stopped with the 3 reserved ride times I stopped going 5 years ago. Now we go to universal and its just as good
Let’s lower the price and have less people go? Doesn’t make sense.
Oh well 😂😂😂
“We do all these stories on people who can’t afford their groceries or gasoline, or at least that was the case under the last administration. It’s gotten a little bit better.” Has it? I haven’t noticed 😒 eggs are still the same price.
There are ways to make it less expensive. Public transportation to the park instead of driving and parking, bringing your own food and drinks or leaving the park temporarily to get a bite somewhere cheaper, finding discounts for tickets. It helps to plan ahead.
Disney has always been a rip off people I know who have gone have to save save save and sleep off grounds eat snacks skip meals not even worth it coming back home in debt need I remind you they saved over a course of time
$1500 for the day!!!???!!!!     Disney simmer down,  don't take your bad spending and poor movie choices on park attendees!!!!!
Cheapskate Americans you only pay a few thousand for a home
Disneyland is now super-overpriced Woke Land.
Has he been living under a rock for the last 20 years?
Why would you wanna go to Disney nowadays anyway? Too crowded, too expensive, too greedy, why support that?
Why the comment about the past administration? With the new administration that light sabre made in China will be over $100.
Did she say that the economy is doing better during this term?😵‍💫  Is she living in Planet earth? 🤔
Keep going to Disney and it will continue to go up in price. Actually, 1400 seems low.
He’s a brilliant dude he couldn’t get his daughter to wear the minie ears so he did 🤣
Earl of Sandwich at Disney Springs would be less expensive.  What a sweet daughter whose favorite part was standing in line with her family.  All families should have her attitude!
Maybe just have one kid not 30?
Disney prices are well known.  Why is this news?
I want nothing to do with Disney . Who's with me???
And it was packed. But I thought everyone was broke?
Disney/ABC/ESPN is a greedy company that does not care about the customers. They only care about making money for their stockholders. Between the greed and the wokeness catering to the trans people I am sure Walt is turning over in his grave.  DO NOT SUPPORT ANYTHING FROM DISNEY!! Force them to sell ESPN/ABC
Do not spend it if you don’t want to be there.
Nothing new ! Here in Cali it’s just about the same. I haven’t seen the inside of Disney since I was 13 and I could never manage to take my four now grown kids . Not only is it corporate greed it’s  absolutely WRONG
I would be embarrassed to admit doing this. Is there something wrong with me?
If you are going to go to Disney you have to do your homework. There are ways to cut costs. Dont just blindly go there and be shocked by the prices. Yes, the prices are outrageous but you should be prepared.
Disney world is such a scam, so not worth those high prices they charge. Don’t waste your money
We don’t go there anymore.
Oh wow, that answer to the 'best part' made me smile tears.
Its the same reason there are $100K to $150K "regular" not exotic, not super cars, not SUPER DUPER DUTY trucks, cars and suvs, because there are enough people either rich enough or stupid enough to get loans to buy them so they keep making them.   The same reason a house costs $600K and isn't a mansion with 8,000 square feet and custom everything, because there are enough stupid people that pay the price or get the loan so they keep putting the prices up there.
Yeah okay... groceries are more expensive today news lady.
That money could have been spent better at a national park,  a historical location or spend it at home with family - look at the child's answer of just talking in line with the family! What a stupid waste of time and money! Go to church and fellowship and have fun with those who unitely love God.
like the prices or not, just because it’s advertised as a family themed park doesn’t mean that have to have family prices. this is a business and people need to stop putting their emotions into everything and trying to blame trump. are you gonna be upset because you can’t afford a nice dinner at nobu? no your gonna find an affordable option. grow up and stop crying. stop being financially irresponsible
Everything Disney is creepy.
KIDS? IN THIS ECONOMY?! In a time when everything cost a lot, who would have guessed having 4 kids/a 6 person family would cost a lot to do anything 🤣🤣👌👌
GREED!!!
Sickening!!
10 day trip was the best for us. Family of 4 and my kids will never forget the great memories we had there.
The dad is a moron.
Shut it down.  Disney is not what it once was.
You can't complain when you have a choice to not go.  If you can't do Disney, then don't go.  No one is forcing you.  I don't go to Disney for this reason.
I think that the park tickets that we paid alone, for 4 days (2 days at Disneyland proper, 2 days at California Adventure Park) for 3 adults and 2 kids were somewhere on the order of like $2500.  So, yes, our trip, which flight, hotel, rental, car, park tix, food, etc. was close to $13k USD, but it's a memory that the kids will have forever.  So, to me, THAT is the value proposition there.
And if you’re lucky a pervert in a costume will feel you up for free
Things are no different under Trump than they were previously
Disney IS OVERRATED!!!  🇺🇸
It’s worth it to me!!!
What is the best thing about the trip? The time spent with my family!❤
You wouldn't get me to go to any Disney at any cost!  It is not what Disney envisioned.  It has become homophobic, demonic, don't believe me, check it out.  Done.  Fini.
It's ok to NOT go to Disneyland. There are plenty of more affordable activities out there 🙄
And yet, Disney is bragging about the uptick in their park visits that helped to boost their recent profit statements.  If you're willing to pay this much today, then you'll pay more tomorrow.
Why is anyone surprised mainstream media is honestly so slow  YouTube channels like clownfish have been saying Disney is pay to play for years and that they don't want families they want rich or at least people that are willing to spend all there money preferably Disney adults that will practically thank Disney for ripping them off and defend everything they do
Pricing yourself out of business…
Don’t worry, Trump‘s gonna make everything more expensive. God bless America.
The news reporter said things are better under this president? What a laugh!😂
Now I have 1,391 reasons to not go to Disney
I like the high cost. Keeps the riff raff out!
That’s the cost for a Florida resident, imagine the cost if you need a hotel and are paying out of state ticket prices. Ridiculous.
All who watch this give a giant collective " DUH!!!"
We give our money to Dolly Parton. Dollywood is our only destination.
And you wonder why so many people have personal debt.
Yeah I went once and never again, expensive and boring
Should have went to Sea World
He'll get a free trip no doubt now. So just record myself complaining about everything... no problem 👍🏾
$35 to park in CA
I have a feeling 4 years from now fox news will still be blaming the last administration. What a joke 2:19
I never brought my family to Disney .
Look…..it’s the U Tube car flipper idiot!
Disney is trying to make up for the BILLIONS they are losing on putting out garbage movie after garbage movie.
This doesn't shock me for me to go from Ohio for a week is over $3000 and that doesn't include plane tickets, buying anything which is shocking to me. We can go to the beach for over 3 weeks for less and that's driving also. It's sad and crazy but to me.
I just seen this video yesterday 😂
I thought Felon47 was going to reduce prices on everything!? What am I missing?
Disney is a greedy corporation & is not priced for the average American family to enjoy. Everything this Dad said is true. We went during the Holidays as a gift for our family of 4 just before Christmas. Never again! It was absolutely claustrophobic especially at the night castle show. It's very dangerous to crowd so many on main street. We had to help protect an infant in a carriage with the parents from the crush of the crowd. As a Florida resident, the perk we get is cheaper tickets in the hottest months of the year. No thanks Disney, not wasting a dime on your corporation again!
Who pays this for a woke horror show?
It’s not the 1930s!!! That Dad is just “weird weird weird”
I love going to the parks but it's getting insane now.
For 1400 that's halfway to renting a oceanfront beach house in the outer banks of north carolina for a week
One can live without Disneyland, but not with high grocery prices.
$245 lunch for 5 persons at Disney is nothing dude! What were you expecting?!? $10 per person?!? You do Disney for your kids and you shouldn’t be discussing such financial subjects in front of your kids…plus you just said that it was an unplanned trip…what were you expecting?!? Buying a last minute flight ticket could cost you more than $1,000 in some cases for a couple of hours flight…thanks for making this news a “political” topic…
Wow that’s absolutely diabolical, I’m glad I took my kids before my uncle retired from Disney, so we got a lot of hook ups that made it much easier for us 🙏🏽
Shocked by the cost but not the communist indoctrination you deserved to get ript off.. WAKE THE F UP SHEEP
Dude is plugging his YouTube channel on national media to complain about how much a vacation he chose to pay for costs, with his daughter on screen. Her response at the end puts a bow on the whole story for me. Sad!
Don’t complain, you decided to go.
Why would anyone subject ourselves to this overpriced torturous endeavor? Is this the first man that has ever calculated his costs? You could not drag me to Disney and it's woke idealism. 🤔🖕
$1,400 sounds reasonable for a family of 5 though. People can always just not go to Disney if they don’t like the price. The reason Disney keeps the prices high is because the parks are so crowded in the first place. If they lowered the prices then people would complain that the parks are way too crowded.
Wait... did she say under the last administration?? Have you NOT seen the prices going up lady? Trump has skyrocketed the price of EVERYTHING!!
2:05  I hate Faux, she just HAD to throw false shade at the last administration, WHILE talking about high cost in the CURRENT administration!😂🤣
"We are all trying to pinch the penny's??... " - then goes on to spend 1,500 on a day trip... joker.
@ 2:22 Why turn this into fake news?
He is also partially promoting his FlyWheels YouTube channel, we all know that!
The Magic of Disney 😂
I've only gone to DLand a couple times in 5 years and grumble about the price.  Thing is, if people will pay it, I don't blame Disney at all.  Things are worth exactly how much people are willing to pay.
It’s become a status symbol
Don’t get your violin 🎻 out for him yet, he made the majority of his money back with the views. I watch his car YouTube channel
You are crazy to go there. Look at what Disney supports. You can take your kids to see central Florida s ecotourism attractions, learn something and have cheaper better fun.
Did he not realize it is really expensive to go there?
I've been saying bye bye to Disney for years. Wake up America. Disney sucks anymore. Corporate greed killed it years ago.
Maybe your kids don’t need Disney trips, just tell them to go outside and spin in circles.
Well… either he was looking for clicks or completely oblivious that as florida residents they could get annual passes that would pay for themselves after one visit. Disney has been offering some good deals for Florida residents as well. Yes its expensive. If he takes his family to national parks, that’s expensive too (flights, food, souveniers) AND like Disney some require reservations, like Arches and now Yosemite. And take off those ears man. Yikes.
Um, things were cheaper under the last administration. It's not "just getting better now", hence your story. Get your facts straight lady. Also, if you are dumb enough to spend that much money, then they are going to keep charging it. Enjoy your higher prices everyone!
Fun fact it's cheaper to fly a family of 4 1st class with hotel for a week in Hawaii then  a week at disney.
Boycott
Kinda funny dude says everyone is trying to penny pinch but then he just keeps swiping his card and lets his kids pick where to eat. Lol. Okay.
If you can't afford it, then dont go and complain.
We went in 2006, best vacation ever. In the 19 years since, the park has gone downiill
And the food is not good or healthy for the price
No matter how you look at it, the magic kingdom is too expensive.
Yea, & normal working people of all colors can’t even take their kids to this place!   Sickening
1400 us$ to go on an amusmentpark for a day😅😮 I go to an all-inclusive trip to Greece or Italy for one week for that money.  One day?  Greetings from Sweden.
Last year we went to magic kingdom as a family of 6 and for the price it’s NOT worth it, we literally rode 4 rides because some lines were 204 minute wait times… try doing that in Florida heat with a toddler. I grew up in FL going to Disney almost every summer and I wanted my kids to experience it but I would rather saw my leg off without pain meds than to go back there. It’s nothing but corporate greed and Walt Disney I’m sure is rolling in his grave. They’ve ruined Disney.
It’s not worth it for me. It’s just not worth it.😮😮
Imagine actually paying money to go to Disneyland...........waste of time
we just got tickets for 5 for 3 days and its 2k just for the park.
Actually, they got off cheap for that many people. At Disney it easily could have been more than double that, She’s probably the only child to say her favorite part was standing in line just to be with family. That is amazingly sweet and shows what good parents she has, but definitely a one-of-a kind answer and doesn’t say much for Disney. .
$30 for parking is just egregious😢
Daughter provided a beautiful answer for what families need....more time with the kids, whether at Disney or just at home sharing family meals. ❤
He’s trying to save money (pinch pennies), so he went to Disney?
Seems like a cheap trip to me. He didn’t buy souvenirs, lunch/snacks or that fast pass stuff. His trip could have cost double easily
Disneyland sucks! Even if it was cheaper.. It's run by Satanist
F Disney
Why would you give your money to Disney ?
If you still pay for Disney! Your stupid! Go to a different park! Decades now this was known about Disney! Don’t act like this is new!
These prices will always go up when ypu have people willing to pay the price.
Easy, get military passes 😎
Rip-off
I always said, "Disney could slash their  prices in half & STILL turn over a profit."
$1000 for 5 people is really not that expensive…
He paid for it tho.  I find it hard to believe that he didn't know what he was getting into
I'm so glad my kids are grown up.  Done with anything Disney.
My sister and I went to Orlando last month, we skipped out on Disneyworld because the cheapest park ticket for one day was over $200, even though it said tickets were starting at $160, the day you choose and taxes racks up and makes it cost more. Supposedly getting more days is cheaper but over $400 per person😅. We decided to just do one day at universal (wasn’t cheap either) and just did a road trip to the national parks.  Knotts cost us $100 a year and we paid for an annual drinks pass and parking, we even get an every 90 minute meal plan. Everything is basically free after 2 park visit and 2 meals.
Could’ve taken em to Chuck E Cheese and saved yourself a grand.  Kids still get to see a rat in a suit and the parking is free!
I didnt pay that much for two seasons passes to Dollywood. Thats with multiple visits, guest passes, food passes, and souvenirs .
Knotts berry farm the Disney alternative here in southern California 😂
What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?
Inflation has gotten WORSE under tang
America, home of the greedy.
Solution: Go anywhere except Disney parks
Capitalism
Why would any parent take their kids there? Today is nothing like it's used to be. They hide the things that happen to kids there. Anyway if this comment isn't deleted. Plz understand I'm born and raised here. And have read the cases. Just avoid anything Disney
Disney is too greedy. Visit our wonderful national parks instead.
Poor white man
No different then being fleeced at a sporting event. $30 to park, $40-$10k+ on tickets, hamburgers $24, water $12, fries $15.
They charge so much and then pay their employees crap too
Boycott this woke propaganda company with a cult following more damaging than scientology
Going viral for something we been paying and doing for years. 😂
Disney is way over rated. The place is run down.
This is just stupid,everyone knows it expensive to goto Disney or Universal especially just for day trip . So i think the person doing this video was just hoping to get clicks and the video went viral. As a Floridian resident he had to know doing a day trip to Disney was going to cost money, i know this and I don’t even live in the state. I’ve have gone to Disney a lot in Florida and  California, in July going to Tokyo Disney. Is it expensive YES , but did you know on Disney website here in the states you can plan a trip up to a year in advance. Also once you figured out your trip (hotel,passes & meal plan)and next page will be your total, you will see all you have to pay at this time is the deposit, next line under that you will see that you have 11 month ( if your doing a year from now)to pay it off. What i do is divide total cost by how total time i get paid ( if it bi weekly or monthly), if you like the amount you see and can afford that amount on every payday you can have your vacation paid off in 11 months, if something come up and you have to cancel Disney will give you all of your money back except for your deposit.
So the cost of Disney was worse under Biden? Did you have to throw in “or at at least (the cost) was higher during the last administration”. That’s just plain untrue.. It was very expensive”. Do they have to do that on this propaganda network?
There is unfortunate truth to these stories, but the business model is set up to get money out of out of state visitors. The longer you are in the Disney bubble the cheaper a lot of those costs are. Not really fair to those who stay nearby and want to do a casual day trip. But Disney made their bed, and ultimately it works. I was there last fall and spent less than 3,000 on 4 days at the parks which included flight, hotel, food, parks, car, and one specialty meal each day. So i know this sucks for this guys family. People like me probably get more value for our buck due to the nature of the business.
The crazy part is.  Kids don't even like Disney Parks. My kids was ready to go in less than 3 hrs.
We live about 40 minutes from Disney, and we take our kids to Disney Springs at Christmas to pick out a toy. If he felt DS was his little hell now, just try to go at Christmas. It's become a nightmare to go, and I think that tradition may end this year.
My Kids are Definitely going to the park. It's just not gonna be Disneyland
Terrible place to go to
Most of your time is spent standing in line. Some fun!
Try visiting from Canada. We spent over 7K USD for 1 adult and 2 kids. 5 days in 1 park. Definitely never returning any time soon.
Lines & prices at Disneyland in Southern California kept us away.
lol  My wife  My God- daughter  Me  Includes admission  Food  Parking  1,500.00$ @ Disneyland & California Adventure ( day trip) in Anaheim, Ca.
I'm glad I went back in early 2000's before the huge price hikes and wokeness took over.
They'll keep charging it as long as ppl keep paying it.
The only reason my family of 5 went was because AAA had a limited flash special for $50 a ticket with a free parking pass. We took a cooler with food, snacks and got locker to keep the cost down. The kids wanted light sabers but after seeing they were $50 we said no alao
Honestly im not sorry for this guy or his family, there is other things to do with your family, maybe save up more to take a family trip to another state instead of spending thousands on a trip  to Disney and spending half the day waiting in line, im not going to spend $50 on a plastic cup made in china where you can buy the same cup from amazon for $6, get over yourselves people and stop asking for sympathy when you spend your hard earn money on Disney
Disney probably trying to make back the money they loss from all the horrible WOKE/DEI movies they released😂🤣
Duck Fisney!🤬
What did you expect? It's Disney, one of the world's greediest companies.
Did he not know the prices before he went? We have not been in 5 years because of their crazy pricing even as a Florida Resident
Parking used to be free and so was the fast pass. This is so ridiculous. They don't want Floridians at the park. I've been to Disney at least 8-10 times in the 90's and early 2000s and I thought it was expensive then. People need to boycott Disney!
For Disney merch go to tje outlets at Vineland and International drive and go to Primark in the Orlando mall for Disney merch at an affordable price. Disney has gone mad 💰
Thanks to your governor
ha
Disney has been way to expensive for a while now and it keeps getting even more expensive. Universal studios is giving Disney a run for its money, with Epic Universe. That is worth the price. Disney needs to get it's act together in more ways than one.
Went to Disneyland in California two weeks ago, prices were outrageous.  Had the same experience as this man for a one day trip. Never again, not worth it. I will say the high prices keep the ghetto people out though.
He complains -and he’s right- yet… he went and paid all that money anyway. He had to have known ahead of time what most of that cost would be. As long as people pay these prices companies will charge what they want. Don’t want to pay it? Don’t go. And I know it’s a “life experience for the kids” (bs-they’ll live)but so is camping, and visiting other places. I remember living in CA going to Disneyland. My dad got free tickets from a giveaway at work, we took a cooler with our food for the day, and drove the long trip there and back in one day. the memories I have most from that isn’t the rides or the Disney itself, it’s the remembrance of how my parents made it work despite how exhausting it must have been for them. And THATS a memory to cherish. ❤
It isn't better. It's worse now with Trump. FOX just can't say that!
Between the high prices, and most of all, pushing their woke, DEI agenda  indoctrinating our children into their perversions. I refused to spend a dime at Disney anymore. Walt would roll over in his grave if he knew what these people did to his company.
Everybody knows it's extremely expensive to go to Disney World  but the place is always packed, why on earth would they lower prices.
Why do you guys want to bring your child there to be groomed . Walt Disney hates kids . Disney is mass mind control.
Key note: He knew the video would go viral.
It is so crazy to me that American people are so greedy and their companies are so greedy every corporation so greedy that one day at Disneyland will cost a fortune. The problem in America is that they are too greedy.
What an idiot. What did he expect? You don’t HAVE to go!
This is why Canadians are not coming, it's got nothing to do with President Trump.
At Disney a $1.00 bottle of water cost you $5.00
Just think how far that $could go for a good college education or a down payment on a house when shes older.
That is insane. For 1,400 dollars you could buy a wedding dress, a motorcycle, a used car, a longer vacation somewhere else.
If you're stupid enough to go there...........no one forced you to go.  If people stopped going, the price will adjust.  Smarten up, you dopes.
Lol complaining that something is expensive 🤪
$30 for parking.... I paid $36 for parking at Sea World of Texas.   Theme parks are not worth it.
His daughter got to enjoy the rides at Disneyworld while dad got to ride the worst ride ever where he got picked up by his ankles and shaken until his wallet containing all of his money, coins and credit cards fell out on the ground and were swept away by Disney Magical Kingdom employees. 🧙‍♀️
I like the high prices to be honest, you ever wait in lines at Disneyland?  Imagine if everyone could go
Groceries under the last administration....you Fox News people are messed up and part of what is wrong today!!
"On people who can't afford their groceries or gasoline, that was under the last administration." lol, never change FOX.  You can't go a day without lamblasting the previous administration. Which administration has people taking out personal loans for groceries? Get real.
The last time I went to Disney World Magic Kingdom, all the lines including the fast pass were around an hour long or more, and half of the rides broke down and no one could ride them.   Come in a wheelchair and you’ll have a better time because they’ll let you skip all the lines. Other than that the whole park is boring and awful.
Just for a day trip???? Bye
Imagine if there was air fares, lodging, and meals on top of that.
Glad I was never into Disney as a Kid
They price out the poor to make more space for the rich.
Stop being cheap take your kids, make memories you can always make more money
Being a bachelor has never seemed so rewarding.
Don't like it. Don't go.
Son and mom :Happy Dad mood: 😭😭😭💸💸💸
I'm so glad my son has outgrown Disney. We flushed so many thousands down the drain at that place over the years. I was actually happy when they went woke, because then I had an unbeatable excuse to stop going. Never again.
Rather go abroad.
Well, to be fair, Disney has to recover all the money they lost on Snow White!
People have known this for years. What a waste of money
I got a season pass at my local theme park for $120 and was upset that the rides were slightly too cramped for me. There are maybe 5 good rides and several good live shows
Disney is not for families anymore.  All they want is your money.  Universal is so much better as they built another park even to help with the crowds
Dang they must don't ever talk at home.
Lesson is.. Do not support Disney.
He had no idea how much tickets and food were before he went ?  This was just a stunt to go "viral"
These parks are a money grab.  Duh.  This has been true since the 90s.  You might be covering it now becuase the middle class is gone.
Her answer at the end was the sweetest thing! How amazing!
Hopefully, others will see this and decide there's better ways to spend the money.
I have no sympathy…  I have my own ways on how to not spend so much on a trip like that for 3 of us… and we were there for a week.  But to spend nearly $1400 in ONE DAY… it’s definitely not worth it for that much.
That was a last minute trip. Had he planned he could have saved more. But plus Disney Springs isn’t the cheapest for dinner.
Disney is all about fairness and equality right ? How come they offer people with more money a better experience ? You pay all that money then you stand in line like a herd a cows waiting to be milked watching the privileged cut the line. They could'nt pay me 1400 to go there.
But Disney has the fl residents special where you could pay $240 for 4 days. If you do the one day, it would be very close to that which can be expensive. They could have planned it better.
Yeah, Disneyland is expensive and there are better ways to spend your money. But this guy's complaining about taking eight people out on a Day vacation! Six children and two adults. I don't care where you go, it's going to be expensive. I'm going to Florida in two months on a red eye for seven day vacation to check out Cape Canaveral and to do a little diving with my best friend and his son, only 3 of us. and we're already up to $6000 and I'm not even there yet, and that's all staying in airbnbs and planning to do most of our own cooking.. by the time my trip is done, 7 days in Florida is gonna cost between $8k and 10k for 3 people.. So don't blame Disneyland..
That’s crazy!!
Im done with  disney
Her answer at the end was the sweetest…
stay home go camping stop complaining
I'm 72 years old; have never been there, and never will go. If enough people keep going, they can and will charge double that. What ever the market will dictate. I did go to Universal once  for a day; on a business-paid trip, paid by the host, not my company. I don't know how much that trip cost for the 20+ group back in the 1990's, but I'd guess it was not cheap.
And they are Florida residents. Their tickets are discounted.
It ain't much better here in California. Trust me.
Stop complaining and don't go next issue
That's actually not bad for a family of five. Imagine playing for lightening lanes, hotels, and merchandise. Also, it was only one restaurant meal. Imagine if all your meals were restaurant dine-ins. It's enough for one person to exceed 1,000, even as a Florida residence, annual passes alone with no block-out dates is over $300.
It was never worth it.
Disney and the other Orlando parks stopped being affordable to most US middle class folks I'd say 10-15 years ago, I visited with family then and I have no plans to return to the area, ever. Foreign tourists may have lessen downturns in ticket sales somewhat but these are and will be traveling less to the US in the years to come. I see a breaking point or they will have to freeze prices for a long time just to survive and keep visitors coming.
Disney is fun but a week going to all the parks yes is well over $10,000 to 15 grand with a family of 4 is crazy expensive but this has been happening for years now
I can actually afford to go to Disney… but I refuse to go to Disney. They have lost my business
Boycott them.
And mothers day will still out shadow Fathers Day
I don’t know what is more madness. The high cost of paying for all this or people charging their credit cards.
as long as people keep going they'll keep charging...boycott for 1 year and watch what happens....
I guess it will be more profit for them when they're going to open a theme park in Emirates expensive tickets and less taxes.
If you're keeping come to Disney .. they keep raising the price .. Everything inside the Disney are overprice .. line is extreme long unless you have to pay extra for priority line ... this is totally BS ..
“It’s gotten a little bit better” are you serious????
I wouldn't give them the money they are greedy beyond words it's only a matter of time before everyone thinks the same they will cost themselves out of business
How did he not expect that cost?
I heard that they overpriced to keep certain people you know the middle class out of the park.
5 kids, wudyaexpect??
Wife and I took our 7 and 9 year old back in February and spent a fortune over two days and our kids didn’t even like it all that much. They enjoyed the non-Disney stuff we did more than the parks.  I think i’m all Disney world’d out for the rest of my life lol. It’s just not worth it.
He didn’t plan accordingly. $200+ for dinner? Could have had turkey legs and saved. Also bring snacks from home. I did the same trip for like $700
It’s been unreasonable and overpriced for some years now. My husband and I stopped going because we can spend less on a full cruise.
News: man with lots of children realize life is expensive
Hopefully they can accept EBT for food soon
Are you kidding me people are getting laid off this guy own a dealership that’s a want not a need
So... privileged people complaining about a rich privilege. Please, let us cry a river for your Disney vacay.
Disney adults/influencers are to blame. They still go and pretend they are excited about the woke stuff coming out lately.
If you do it once in a lifetime? no biggie...But it seems they's run outa "ONcer's" in no time....
Why would you buy tickets at the gate?
I grew up in florida i remember it costing under 30 a person. We would load up as teenagers in soneones car and go for the day during the summer. We had a blast. My kids grew up without disney the money was put into things that have lasted them into adulthood. Disney just wasn't and isnt in our radar or theirs.
Yeah, I'll take a hard pass on going there.
How is this news? Who actually thought Disney was some bargain vacation?
Look up how much it costs disney world to run in a single day and do some math on the average daily attendance. That will really make you mad.
You don’t go to Disney to save money.  Lmao
And all whilst you suffer in outrageously long lines in unbearable heat! Have fun - never again - we took out a second mortgage back in the early 2000’s to experience it 😂
With mountains of people in lines paying tickets and low wages to the employees, where does the money go?
I remember in the 90' entry was like $25 for an adult and $16 for a child, now it's 10 times that amount. Ignore inflation, Disney got insanely greedy, nothing can justify those prices.
Damm Disney probably make at least 55 million a day in ticket sales
If people stopped going it would change
Kids we going to 6 flags and calling it a day 😂
You could have gone cheaper just get a pass could have bring your own snacks  LMAO
Trumps America lol right wing bastards
Why take your children on a trip and complain about the cost the entire time? 🙄 Sir, do better❗️What grown man behaves like that? His complaining took away from the experience. Next time, go somewhere that you can afford.
I could go on and on about this topic and how what used to be a family tradition for us hasn't happened in almost 10 years! I love Disney, I am not one of the fans who was too upset about the movies and all that, but what does upset me is that Disney parks has started to cater to the wealthy and in debted people.
Easy solution…do something else
They know people will go in debt even to go so they will never lower the prices. I bet only around 30-50% of people that go save and pay out of pocket sadly.
God bless capitalism and the free market
Do you think that's bad now? Just wait,  with the current administration, not even Mickey Mouse will survive!. 🐁🤡
$20 in the 90's, even when Indiana Jones opened.  SoCal tickets were cheap.  Disney is completely insane now.
That’s insane. Never have been and never will.
The higher cost they will pay is the current values Disney promotes 🏳️‍🌈🐐🏳️‍⚧️👺😈
Why are people whining about this? Disney operates a business, let them charge whatever they want. It's not a national park or something. I feel absolutely no obligation or desire to take my own kids. My kids are almost weened off Disney anyways. I also don't want to take them to Paris and don't whine about the price of airplane tickets of French hotels.
Disney just said on the news yesterday they are BUILDING a big park in one of the Muslin countries complements of all the dumb people in the US who spend a fortune in all their expensive parks. Wake Up people! Quit being taken by greedy greedy Disney!!!!!
Odd that people that buy every overpriced item that Therapist Trump sells would complain about the cost of a vacation that actually produces.
Child trafficking resort
That $44.90 lightsaber is made in China. The base price, before USA tariff was $3.80.  I bought one in Disney HongKong.
It’s not just Disney try to go to a NFL,NBA or NBL games
All that revenue and they pay their hourly workers so little that many of them are unable to pay for basic necessities. Meaning the taxpayers are having to subsidize Disney's payroll with low income assistance for their staffing. All while corporate executives get higher and higher pay. The money is there. It's just not being used appropriately in my opinion.
Pinch pennies why go to Disney 😂😂😂
He could clearly afford it. Those of us who can't afford it would not even attempt it, not even trying to do it on a credit card. So I don't know why he's on here complaining. He's one of those people that contributed to the high cost.
w0w, typical PROMO session.. This guy makes money from YOU watching him on here and still whines about the cost of Disney world? What a cheapskate!
That’s why we don’t go may 8 2025
I am shocked, shocked that Fox News would run an anti-Disney feature.
Lightening Passes are $24 for 3 rides.. It’s worth the time saving. ✌🏽
Kendall is such a peach!!! Hope she remembers the trip forever! ❤
$30 to park is ridiculous!!!!
Even when I grew up Disney was always known to be overpriced, this was in the 2000s
You need to be upper middle to upper class to afford Disney...
3:18 🥹🥲 did not expect to tear up when I clicked on this video. Kendall your a beautiful soul ❤
2:20 “it’s gotten better” you sure?
Disney is expensive.
The mouse took all me money lol
Feeding the beast, we have to start learning to say no and teaching our kids to not be slaves to consumerism.
It's Disney! I hope you looked into the costs before going to Disney.
I don’t think Mr. Disney would be happy about this!!!
I dumped Disney+, stopped watching it some time ago....just no value with that streaming service either.
Never put the kids on. She killed the complaint. You can’t put a price on family time and she literally said, waiting in line was the best part. You’re welcome, Disney.
Critical thinking definitely not in play with the people who think Disney is a magical memory for their children. As for the kidults who go on their own like it's a religious requirement, pay your debts instead, maybe then you'll be able to afford more tats.
Last month Disney was advertising day passes to us Canadians at $105.00CAD, still wouldn’t go…
$1400 dollar for a day trip in disney for 5 and 1 baby in my country if you convert the amount its 78,400 you could used that money to pay a downpayment for a car.
Yes, Disney is extremely expensive and many of their employees live in motels or their cars. NO, food prices are not better now than the last adminstration. That is a lie. Glad Epic Universe is open...that would be my first pick for themepark in Orlando.
The cost is ridiculous.  Besides that, they have ruined it as a place you are supposed to go and forget the troubles of the everyday world for just a little bit.  Nope!  They put the troubles of our world front and center.  And, of course, they go and pick sides and push their viewpoint supported by false narratives.  Same reason I no longer watch ESPN, and I no longer go to the movies.  They are all no longer entertaining, just infuriating.
If there were noBl acks, I would spend the extra money.
I stopped going to d e I disneyland
Disney said they wanted to make more money while having fewer guests. They are greedy
His daughter is adorable.
My family went there in the early 90's when my daughter was 8.   I was amazed that all the buildings in the village were just stores selling more Disney stuff.    I decided then that I'd never go back, and I haven't.  It's obviously far worse now than it was then.
Who made this guy go to Disney? People aren’t entitled to an education, healthcare, a living wage, but this guy is crying that Disney isn’t as cheap as we wants it to be?
That is more than I make in a month.  I'm happy to PASS on that.
Only a idiot would go there
You can do Disney cheaper by not staying in the resorts and bringing in snacks, skip lightning passes!! Just plan..  How could he not know??
Exactly! We stopped going.
Boycott Disney.
In what world does the host live in where this administration is better than the previous one
Gross Profit for 2024 year was $34,000,000,000    or $34 Billion . Workers on minimum wage, CEO on $41,000,000 ($41 Million) salary. Says it all!
It’s no longer Disneyland its Disney Spend!!
Kids just like to spend time with parents. It doesn’t have to be Disney
My illegal alien friend went to Disney for free.
And this is why I go to Universal more
Go Maga!! Who cares about money...
That is still more affordable than Disney in Los Angeles.
That’s part of doing business. Did you guys miss the part that he’s a business owner for a family of four to enjoy everything they wanted and had an amazing time together 1400 is cheap and think of the thousands of employees and all the time Disney get sued All the money that they lose. I don’t see nothing wrong with it. That’s part of doing business every giant organization every amusement park any entertainment company is doing the exact same thing you wanna play then you pay if they give it to the people for dirt cheap Disney and their employees will not make any money
The high $ may be because they are still trying to recoup the insane amount of $ spent on the Star Wars brand.
What price for a warped, distorted irreality- and woke too?!
Disney makes an announcement about new theme park in Middle East and this is the best Fox News can come up with? Grasping truly for news.
If you cant afford it, then dont go. Simple as that!
No way I would ever spend that much money on one day can’t afford it! There is better way to spend $1400 on something else
Is this the Onion?
Keep crying yall, it was that expensive in the 90’s
Then do not go… if you live in Florida, buy an annual pass or go to Universal….
All that money just to wait in lines. Ha Ha Ha
No sympathy for SUCKERS.
Free Market Republics .  Unless its Disney
Instead of take your kids to disney take them to the nature park and they will learn alot more than go disney
I don't understand it.    Nobody is forced to take their family to Disney.... literally no laws enforce a day at a theme park with your family.  There is no moral or ethical obligation to do so. With that being said, this man is fully aware that he can utilize the worldwide web aka internet to plan how to spend his money to entertain his kids, and he knew beforehand that it would cost so much. He films himself dishing out dollars over dollars in a ridiculous never say no day at pedoland.   Then goes online to complain about it??  The shame here is that he made himself look like a unwitting victim to scam.      He already knew what he was getting into.  The shame here is that instead of taking his family for a fun, memorable and affordable vacation.......he opted to waste his money on one day to Disneyworld, and then go complain about it.
You'll pay it and like it !
Oh man.. I wanted to do a trip with my big sis.
You couldn’t pay me to go to Disney World.
I used to live in Orlando, FL. Disney sucks. No way Id spend that much money for overpriced garbage.
1400  probably cover a day expense for family of3 in Disney. If you’re struggling and can’t afford it  just stay away I have been there one time and never going back
Trump supporters worship capitalism now they want everything free in Trump kingdom 😂
Disney uses the theme parks to fund their movie production.
Since they’ve gone woke they probably lost a lot of. Business, over charging  those who want to go there . Not worth it!!!
Welcome to America,  cesspool of greed.
He had to have known how much it was going to be, but did it anyway and then complained about it on national TV with his kid.  If it is too expensive, don't go.
$1500/day for a family of 5 to stand in line for half the day .
Amusement park prices aren't going to get better. One of the drivers of the price they charge is how soon they close the park because of capacity during the day. There's a set amount of people the park can hold. They can't let in more people than that amount. Last time I went to Disney the park closed off new admittance in the early afternoon. This happened all three days. When this happens daily they raise prices to lessen demand and keep the numbers under capacity. It's simple supply and demand. Why would they lower prices so everyone can afford it and they close the park capacity at 10:00 AM? Then turn away people all day long who think they're going to Disneyland that day? That makes no sense. Disney is not for poor people, but that's many things in life. Sad, but true.
I wish that Trump or Elon would buy Disney and make it great again
Disney is simply a corporation doing what it’s supposed to do. The reason they keep their price point so high is because there are plenty of people willing to do everything from maxing out credit cards to spending their children’s college money on a Disney trip, all because a lifetime of the TV telling them they’re bad people and worse parents if they don’t give their futures to Disney.
Bring the fam to Dollywood next time.  She's way less crowded and more affordable and consistently ranks as a world class theme park.  Plus the Smoky Mountains will make your eyes pop.  Koyukon-Athabascan Nation
Take your kids to a museum. They are air conditioned and your kids will learn something. Also its a lot cheaper. Not sure what museums they have in Florida anymore.
I have 7 kids, 3 of whom are special needs, with one in particular absolutely LOVES Mickey Mouse. She watches Disney parades every single day on her i-pad and asks me every day when i can take her to Disney World. Sadly, even though i make a reasonably decent living, ill never be able to afford it. I wish i could have her experience it all. The joy i know she, and all my kids, would experience would be amazing, but i know it's just not a possibility given the ridiculous cost.  So sad, bc i remember going a few times with my family when i was a kid, and i have such great memories. Different times, i suppose.
Living expenses have NOT GONE DOWN WITH THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION! I must be in the wrong state,
Its not news that Disney is overcharging. Self inflicted pain.
Yeah the price of tickets go up to keep "undesirables" out of the park.
Don’t blame Disney blame inflation. If daddy earn $35 an hour then he wouldn’t be complaining 😂.
He's from Florida so he's already getting a discount 😂
No to a possible lifetime, keep sake, but yes to a $19 🍺 & pretzel lol
Sucks six flags is shutting down but Disney will keep making money
I don't feel sorry for anybody who is still giving money to Disney in any form.woke crap. Take your kids to universal. Everyone knows you don't go to Disney for the last six or seven years where has he been under a  rock?
Disney is surely ridiculously expensive. I'm really surprised anyone can afford a trip like that. I don't even live in FL so add the out of state prices along with the air fare travel and a hotel to the mx, it's totally out of the question. For me personally Disney is an organization I no longer support to begin with so my $$ will never be spent there even though we did go as a family some 30+ years ago when Disney was a different organization. My daughter and her family just had a field trip to a recent Chicago Cubs game may have been a better deal simply because it was a packaged "home school co-op" organized field trip but the food prices inside the ball park was insane. Plus it cost $80 to park for the day. That will likely become a one time event as who can afford professional sports at those prices, even after the cost of the tickets in and of themselves. I'm guessing, little by little, most regular middle class families no longer can afford to do anything of this nature in the future. Places like Disney, sporting events, concerts, etc. will become a thing for the elite and no one else.
This is not news
I don't want to expose my grandchildren to Disney....This due to total value, actual time in line v's rides, liberal anti - christian family messaging. Walt has got to be rolling in his grave. Sad times indeed.
Stay your a@& at home problem solved
It’s spendy taking your family there. We spent the next year in state.
MAGA Goober.
If the place was packed I guess a lot of people are affording it.  I wouldn't spend $100!
BOYCOTT    so WHY did you go and spend the money??  oh right, for views.  ridiculous
Totally agree, what was a value 15 years ago is now gross. Never again will I take the family after last months $1,500 family ripoff.
They actually sell shirts in the park that say “most expensive day ever”
Trumpenomics, get used to it
Yup, Disney is only worth going once in a while. When each family member saves a few $1,000 plus. 😅🥲😑
I read this headline as “stupid parent doesn’t know how to plan for expenses“.
No thanks. Paying money to stand in line and paying for Wokeness. And to add insult, they charge you to park.
It’s Trumps fault he’s screwing us all
LOL... I/My family didn't grow up poor, poor, but my parents weren't "well off." My parents where "a hair" below Middle Class. We "realized" we couldn't "Afford" Disney World back in 1982!!! LOL... And He LIVES in Florida!!! They didn't have to purchase Airplane Tickets for FIVE! They didn't have to stay at a Hotel for FIVE! LOL... That would have "bumped" that cost to over $15,000!!!
Not just Disney it's everywhere  it's about trying to take as much money from you as possible ,dont even need to bring up the insurance topic😅😅
Your paying for Brand, not even other theme parks cost as much
No thank you!
$1400 divided by 5  = $ 280 for parking access to 4 parks and a meal at Disney springs it’s what you make it , yes it’s expensive but it’s about the same price as a dollar store plastic toy is going to cost over the next couple of months 😂
American are too greedy. Everyone put high margin on everything. Life become expensive. Labour become expensive. Thats why trumps tariff will never works. The purpose of tariff is to open jobs in america. But with high cost labour? High cost raw material? Impossible. America will never beat china.
You don’t have to spend that.  Maybe plan better next time.
Wait until your kids drink and you do Drink around the world.
This segment misses some key context. First off, as Florida residents, they could have easily taken advantage of discounted resident annual passes with a monthly payment plan. That’s just poor planning.  Second, the claim that Lightning Lane would have “doubled” the cost is misleading. As of today, May 8, 2025, the most expensive Lightning Lane Multi Pass is $29 per person. For five people, that’s $145, not even close to doubling the $1,400 total. It’s not Disney’s fault he didn’t do his research.  Third, this guy has a YouTube channel and openly calls himself a millionaire. He recently sold a home in New England for just under $1 million before relocating to Florida. He’s not exactly the average family struggling to afford a day at Disney. Most of the high cost here seems to be due to his own choices.
That's exactly what I said after our last trip to Disneyland, it saddens me to know that there are families that don't have that luxury to be able to take their kids to Disneyland.
Ask a child if it was worth it. How the hell would she know, she didn't work for that 1400.00 dollars.
3:20 she better have asked for some money after that. lol smart girl
Welcome to the United States of MAGA! 🎉🎉🎉
They have to keep raising prices to offset the flopped movies they are producing.
GURL!!!!! What has gotten better???  Yall lies!!??  The last Adminstration spent time cleaning up what the "last" Adminstration messed up.  The Repubs always have us STRESSED!!!!!   Lying Lady!!!
Disney is very expensive, went there a couple of times years ago, no need to go back. But everything has become expensive, a meal in a restaurant, a glass of wine, a ticket to a game, a beer at a sport event, a ice cream cone, etc. I’m glad I was able to do all of those things in the past and I don’t miss them. Nowadays, my activities are free for the most part like free pickleball with friends at a city run court, bicycle ride on beautiful trails around town, swimming in the beautiful outdoor pool in my condo development, walking with friends in a park, etc. I have just as much fun and it’s free!
And I remember when parking was almost  nothing,.. entrance at the gate was little for the day...... and if I had a $20. in my pocket I could have a wonderful day and not use all my "E" tickets up.🤔
What would happen if Walmart charged for parking.
That is diabolical!
Way a minute it's that cheap 😂😂😂😂 I was expecting 2500
Disney is always Packed to The Brim…
Cheatney
The more you spend in Disney, the more they gonna raise the price.
USA need better public transportation system. Even Disneyland Hongkong can be reached with cheap train.
The daughters last statement.  Yes. Stuff truly doesn't matter.
Why is this a story? We literally have people going to food pantries and we’re talking about how expensive Disney World is… GTFOH. Disney World has always been expensive.
Thought Don was going to fix all this. More lies!!!!
If you're dumb enough to pay it they're smart enough to charge it.
Those greedy democrats.
There are plenty of tricks out there to help you save costs on a Disney trip for anyone who cares to look and do a minimal amount of planning.   If dad had done this he could have had the same trip for at least $400 less.  Just a sample of a few things you can do:  check online for cheaper admission days.  Buy gift cards from Target or Costco at a discount.  Get a Disney visa card, and pay bills on it for a while, just having one saves you 10% off all the purchases, and you earn dollars for the spending.
Then dont go you complain about a beautiful clean experience at a cost.. But you are ok with US automakers adding 30 K onto the cost of a car...
They should've got the current Florida residents deal. Which is a 4 day park pass for 240. The days don't have to be used together. The deal ends in September. Instead it sounds like they spent alot on extras
If you can't afford it, don't go. Also you chose to have 5 kids. That comes alone is a substantial cost. If you don't like large corporate greedy companies, don't go. I know a few billionaires who don't give a f about you & your whining...
Only stupid people think there is something "magical" about a Disney experience. You can have an excellent childhood without overpaying to see a fake mouse and his friends. 🙄
I live in Florida and get the annual pass much cheaper way to go. The dinner and parking is on par with the rest of the parks
I live one hour away and refuse to go. Go woke, go broke!
Why not just get the Florida resident annual pass and put it on Klarna like peaches McIntyre
People can’t afford groceries and this guy complaining about a Disney trip ! SMH
Good thing her favorite part was standing in line because you sure get to do a lot of that!
How is this news
hotdog cost in disney land is a rip off! :D
I mean I live in Florida and even with the price Disney is always packed. I don’t want to Imagine how bad it would be if they lowered it and everyone could go.
Funny how the host CLAIMS prices under "the current administration are better then the last". Conservative news.
U can go to Disney springs and go to blaze pizza. And spend about 12 dollars a person
Looks like Mickey Mouse, pickpocketed you!
Hey that’s the headlight correction guy!
Where do y’all think Bob Iger’s compensation comes from? $41 million a year. Not going back to Disney anytime soon, sorry
No, it hasn’t gotten a little bit better under this administration. It’s gotten way worse! When are the promised price drops happening at the grocery store? We have a liar in the oval office, plain and simple.
Can you sneak in your own food from mcdonalds??? I mean why would you want to pay that just for food for a burguer???😂😂😂😂😂
No, it hasn’t gotten a little bit better under this administration. It’s gotten way worse! When are the promised price drops happening at the grocery store? We have a liar in the oval office, plain and simple.
And they pay their employees even long-term full-time employees practically nothing
Just refuse to go there! Easy to do, tell the kids no and if you’re a kid at heart tell yourself no! Don’t give in to the mouse. Disney was the greatest salesman who ever loved! The fool tricked millions into believing a mouse can talk!
What was he expected really? 5 people and they ate inside Disney. It’s a theme park! Everybody knows it’s gonna be expensive!
If people keep paying the prices, they will keep charging more and more. But, not enough people give up. 🤷‍♀️
Because YOU and others PAID those amounts, they know they never need to lower their prices
Corporate greed,  stop going !
Why would you give a company like Disney $1400? I'm sorry bud, but the joke is on you for paying Disney's rediculous prices.
I’ll never forget the first time I went to Disneyland as a kid.  My Dad’s reaction to being charged to park😮
Take a plan trip internationally with hotel and food for like 800 bucks.
DISNEY WORLD‼️ SUPERBOWL NOPE ‼️ WRESTLEMANIA NOPE‼️ …  OFF LIST‼️ WALKING YUP
This woman really said grocery prices have gotten better 😅 what a liar
I’ve been saying that since 2000. It’s way too expensive and I had Military discount for my family. Did go back to Orlando once more after 2000 but just for Universal.
Disney just changed their pricing to $60 a day for Florida residents and I’m almost certain it’s because of this families viral video and going on the news.
Lol….things are getting better….😂 does she really believe that?
"LOOK HOW STUPID I AM!!!"
You could have put that into bitcoin and see it grow over time
I thought Disney created Disneyland for ALL children. Evidently not…
Boycott Disney, they are a woke  liberal no good company (ps) removed our favorite ride splash mountain called it racism, look how they are racist they have a way to keep a certain class of people in the lower end resorts and other class in higher end resorts
He is a YouTuber and car lot owner with a Ferrari, Lamborghini Corvette and multiple other cars. He can afford it
I like Fox News
Her response at the end was incredible ...good job raising their kids
Vacations anywhere are expensive. If you want to be cheap, go to a national park. If you want to take a premium level vacation, it's going to be expensive. This is the same whining and crying we've heard for Decades. $200/day for a vacation is really not that much.
If He can afford to take His family of 5 to Disney, He has no reason to complain. Period. Privileged rich guys problems.
Then do not bring youth in to the world at all
It is better to Imagine going there than actually being there it seems.
It’s just like supply and demand! If people are willing to pay the price it will remain so.
The woke ruined a good thing.  ABC is owned by Disney.  How sad...
At first, I thought this was from The Onion or The Babylon Bee.  Then I realized it was more like something from Not The Bee.
Corporations of America's international subterranean world
Where money makes dreams come true no longer where dreams come true
Disneyland /world is a glue trap for those with too much income.
My man Craig! Love his YouTube content
Family vacation to Disney for 4-5 days is not a 10k vacation. It’s a 20k vacation when you factor in hotel and travel fees. And no, it’s definitely not worth it.
Complaining about the cost and being a Florida resident. What do you think a non-resident pays? Costlier tickets, accommodations, flights, three meals a day, etc..
All that is Hype , when I was a Kid Astro World in Houston Tx was really fun and it wasn't expensive , when it gets this Expensive is all hype .
Not for me!  I went to Disneyland years ago as a kid.  It was nothing like crazy expensive or we wouldn’t have gone.
Not only is this corporate greed but it shows how small-minded people are. If you want to expand your family's mind and have fun with him there's plenty of things to do other than Disney world or Disneyland. There's the beach there's countless national parks. My dad lives in Florida and we go to Merritt Island wildlife refuge all the time when we visit him. I don't understand why people think they need this kind of entertainment to have family fun.
most of souveniers purchased usually end up in garage sells
Heck no I would not go to woke Disney let alone bring my family.👎🏼
Nobody is forcing these people to go 😪😪😪
Pass.  I dont see the draw.
2:20 under the last administration.  What a bunch of  zero accountability .  Stop blame. Other and start opening your eyes. Dump the trump con man
That doesn’t include fast pass fees. Universal is way better and more affordable.
I’ll be damned I let a mouse rob me for my cheese
Rip off.
Do the intelligent folks at fox go into an office and have a round table discussion on how to make Joe Biden and the last administration look worse than what is happening today with dumpster fire as president? She had to get that jab in there about the "last administration" which was a completely unnecessary comment. No need for this type of audience manipulation and propaganda. Disney was just as high during the last administration.
Poor Dad😢
His fault for even going. Disney is a woke joke
Disney: rip off !
I never got the appeal of those parks. Paying all that money to stand around waiting for 2 minute rides doesn't seem like a fun vacation.
Oh my god, going to Disneyland just queue all day! The girl valued the most is the time they got to talk while in the queue. 😂🤣 They could have done that at home.
It’s called American Creed. We all want it. We need beach homes , mountain cabins, etc. it’s capitalism baby
Easy Boycott Disney!
Mickey is laughing all the way to bank.
Family of 5?  Uh yeah it will cost that much.
I am in the U.K. and go to Florida once a year if we can but don’t do Disney as it’s expensive for us. To do all the parks would be over £1000 each before you pay to park and eat. Disney is way over priced even tourist struggle. It’s such a shame to be a Florida resident and can’t afford to go, shame, shame on Disney. Walt would be turning over in his grave with this. It was designed to have fun and for everyone to share his dream not just for the rich
It is supply and demand, even at these prices the parks are super overcrowded. By just looking at the crowds I would say they need to raise prices even more.
Well if you keep supporting Disney like that they're going to keep charging you like that everybody should be boycotting Disney
😂 someone didn’t do his research before going.
Why be surprised? When you are intentionally pushing a woke political agenda using every media source you own and the results are financial disasters you have to get funds from somewhere. The house of mouse is anti democracy , leftists,  globalists,  anti culture , dumpster fire. If you support them you are part of the problem.
I've  never  been  to Disney.  I don't  have  any  plans  of ever  going there.
If you guys are stupid enough to keep paying then this is what you deserve. Walt Disney never ever would have expected families to pay this much. One of the things he prided himself on was all families were able to afford his park News flash Bob Iger is a businessman, not a family Christian man And if you guys haven't noticed. Bob Iger is trying to erase everything that Walt stood for
Who asked you to go there?
This is so attention seeking. He knew it was a hot topic. Everyone knows Disney is a scam these days.
I was at Disney world once in 1973 and it was pretty good, about $4.50 for admission. Once is enough for me!
Ye another reason not to do Disney.
It's a scam.  These memories are not worth it.  I went in the 80s and remember nothing of the trip when I was a child.
1400 bucks in California will get you a nice 1 bedroom in the most ghetto part of any area with a whole bunch of water backs don’t speak English or knee grows that’s loud and obnoxious and pulls out the race card if they don’t get there way
If you think we are going to spend under $3,000 for a day at Disney then you are braindead and no concept of reality.
Disney has totally become unaccessible to most. Couple that with the WOKENESS and the accidents that happen there, and it's just become a <bad> joke.
That man needs a medal just showing how much of a ripoff Disney actually is . Shame as I would love to visit but at these prices Mr Disney would probably turn in his grave know how his name and parks are run now
What? Daddy didn’t look at the prices before hand?!  Poor daddy.  Spent all that $$$.  What a hatchet job.
Disney continues to sell out even with high prices.
Well duh, Disney has to recoup the Snow White loss  somehow 😂
Disney has become a vacation grift. Avoid.
First-World Problems. Right up there with Meghan & Harry. Crying over how expensive your privileged lifestyle is becoming.
Who would pay that much to stand in a line for over a hour for one ride, what a joke! They can’t have my money.
I was appalled at the cost(s) 35 years ago. I haven't been back since.
Why is he blaming Disney for his apparent skill issue?  The guy is a business owner, and yet he’s paying max price on tickets that there are 100s of ways to get for cheaper.
Unbridled capitalism. Our government is completely corrupted.
Half price in Europe at Disney in Paris... Just saying.
I grew up in Orlando.I was in college and sang at the Opening. Disney started the downfall of Florida. I wish they had never come here. $30 for parking????? Give me a break. Why should you pay for parking when you have to pay so much to get in? Its all ridiculous.
COME ON , NOW !!!!   YOU DIDN'T REALIZE DISNEY WAS GOING TO BEND YOU OVER AND GIVE IT TO YOU ????  HEY , IT'S TIME TO WAKE UP DUMMIES OUT THERE IN WALLY WORLD 🌎🌍 MENTALLY !!!!!
They still earned record profits on their theme parks so these prices are only going up and up. Ppl complain but clearly they are still willing to pay
Hard pass on Disney….too expensive and crowded. When they put Minnie in a pantsuit it was over for me. Disney is definitely NOT the “happiest place on earth”.
So true and so sad! I’ve loved going to Disney and went with girlfriends last year - when I got home I told my husband that I felt wounded because of the cost…families can’t afford this kind of fun - no family needs to go in debt to take their family to Disney. 😔
It's for rich people,  get over it, cry babies.
Look forward to the day that we as consumers band together and refuse to go to the parks until they are within a proper price range. Maybe then they could hear us. It breaks my heart that the magic is gone for me.
I live in Australia, six people for a day, $200 bucks is cheap as chips, from Perth to Rottnest island for a day is not far off
Fake News !! Prices ARE DOWN since Trump became President.
Even Disney Cruise in Singapore costs thousands for one person, Disney is greedy these days
3:03  😂 She either forgot the didn't want to break his heart with the truth
DOLLYWOOD A FRACTION IF COST, MUCH MORE FUN!
When i lived in Florida I knew Florida Residents got a Deep Discount ! I had the  ability to afford it for my wife and myself but never went! Even at the Deep discount i never felt any attraction to go. Maybe ive been to 6 Flags In NJ to many times making the whole Theme park thing a waste of time and money. Ive driven thru Orlando a few times just to get pissed at all the Disney Traffic.
Disney has destroyed everything
Funding left wing ideologies is not something I will do. A little short term entertainment is not worth funding of the larger idea of supporting the Agendas.
Fox viewer left in shock by reality!
Okay, this guy is a successful car dealer and drives a Ferrari, so he can afford to go to Disney, if he wishes.  Everyone else, stay away, vote with your wallets.
So don't go? Victim everywhere. 1400 to line up for 6hrs and 3 rides.
Disney will never get a dime of my money
I bet if Dad asked his kids who do they want to have at dinner. His kids would say family. 😢❤
When it was the 2000s my parents told me Disney was too expensive, now I can't even take myself 😂
Why is he surprised though? Anyone who has kept up within the last three years knows of price hikes, Disney messing over annual ticket holders and fast pass issues. There is nothing new here, they are pricing out the middle wage incomes. You have options in that area, maybe those should exclude Disney.
"Waiting in lines and hanging out with the family". Priceless.
It’s the used car guy! Craig can afford it!
Then don't go
Disney literally ruining everything. Specially movies and shows.
I just bought a six flags season pass for $101. It was $85 plus tax. Season pass is for the entire year of 2025 for both Six Flags Great Adventure and Hurricane Harbor, which includes free parking, 10% off all food and items purchased at the park (used to be 15%}, and offers percentage for friends tickets with you. I was just in Orlando. Universal prices are much better
974÷5=194.8.....no effing way.
This can't be real. You can look up prices before you do something, then choose not to do it if it's not in your budget. Next time, bring your family to the beach for free.
Instead of complaining, how about this: DON'T GO.
I sorry but you didn't know how much it cost before you went there?
We went for a day and spent $1,800 for 4 people.  Genie pass, 200 degrees outside, rented the stroller for $30-50. The family members we met up with from out of town made it 2 hours with the heat. This is no longer the average family magical experience and has become too exclusive.
DUDE!  I knew it was you when I saw that video!  Flying Wheels from NH!
Things aren't getting better at the grocery either, why did she say that, totally misleading.
Is it great yet Fox 🎉
Never went & im happy i never did cuz of the cost & the woke nonsense on top of that
Like all theme parks there diminishing is enevatable
Disney isn't even that great either. Spend 80% of your time waiting in lines
I went to disneyland in nineteen seventy five I think it was fifteen dollars to get in
Idky you had to randomly bring politics in there. Which btw, I'm struggling with groceries now versus last few years... =_= also... that girl is precious! Good job there sir, pain in the wallet but glad to hear your family had a overall good experience!
I went to Disneyland once with my son for the first time, saved up all year for it. I will never go back. The lack of customer service, the long lines especially after getting the Lightning Lane Passes, and overall experience I felt was lackluster. We were treated like garbage from the staff, which tells me it is learned from management.  The saving grace was the really nice server I had but other than that Disneyland is insanely expensive. I am glad I got the experience out of the way. I had a much better time at Universal Studio in comparison. I will not be returning to Disneyland. Save your money, there are so many better resorts/nature parks out there!
Your Money Magically Disappears.
I hope universal Orlando studios isn't like this. I think their cheaper
Ill say it once ill say it again its not Iger. Chapek and mostly COVID is the one who ruined the costs of the company Iger is the one doing everything he can to fix it but its not easy. Starting next year Iger is making things change. Hec Iger doesnt even like the Tiana ride either. I remember when Iger steped in he did such amazing things for the company.
I wish people would stop wasting their money and lives on fake experiences. Go to a real park, go to a real lake, and climb a real mountain. Family time is precious, stop buying togetherness.
Disney has been expensive for a long time , that’s what what I’ve been saying to people here in California, I’m not spending that kinda money and  I live only 8 miles from it
I love how she say last administration 😅😅😅😅    he went a couple days ago.   Pass the buck huh.   But yeah.    It's nuts. Here in California disney.    Litterly. Spend like $600 more this lasr visit a couple weeks ago than last years visit.   So it's really out  of control now
Want to enjoy life…don’t complain.
At least $1400 is gone the first hour. That's wild.
$1400 for 5 that’s not too bad lol that’s probably not including gifts and souvenirs and snacks inbetween. I love how the little girl says her fav part was standing in line talking to her family. I enjoy that as well. I’d still go I don’t care how much it cost 😂
Aren't the prices posted on line?  I assume you would look into prices beforehand and consider the cost before going.  If it's too expensive do something else.   I can't believe they are complaining about expensive theme park trips.   Good grief.
I used my credit card points to get in the parks I got gift cards to pay for it. I did pay for the lightening by passed upgrade and that was worth it. We only did 1 day also.
$245 for dinner for 5 people at a resort and the dude is complaining? What does he think he is doing going to Burger King?  The average cost of the meal is per person  $49. If a tip is involved — minus 20% tip is around $39 person. If you are going to a resort, $49 a person is not out of the realm of possibilities.  If you go to any high level amusement park you will pay for it—I took my nephews a few years ago and the day passes were a few hundred.
Awe,,poor little family.....talk about being out of touch.....here's some advice,  buy a fishing pole and get real dummy
This guy will do anything to get in front of a camera.  Seems he is branching out from his used car videos.  And, of course, Fox never misses a chance to attack something they believe to be woke.  A Disney World Theme Park ticket for one day can be purchased for $125 with a bit of planning.  A 3-day ticket for 10 years or older is $89 a day, $267 total.  For kids 3-9 the cost is $59 a day for a 3-day ticket, $177 total.    Choosing to spend $250 or so for lunch is a choice.  Thirty dollars to park is not excessive.     Personally, I applaud Fox.  Anything that limits the number of MAGA for anything is a plus.
So pretty much half the day you’ll be in a line waiting..
We went back in February and it was absurd how expensive everything is, 450$ for 4 adults and a toddler at Crystal Palace for lunch buffet (slightly elevated prison food).  1000$ for tickets for the day!  The worst part of everything is the park is now designed for weird adults trying live out some fantasy.  It was incredible how many adults we saw dressed up in disney garb and their kids were being pulled along.  Or adults jumping in front of little kids to get pictures with characters.
Republicans literally did this and  fox news supports tariffs. Terrible reporting
In 1996 when i was 6 my parents took me to Disney for a week. It was extremely expensive then. Why would it be less expensive now when the cost of everything has increased? Im surprised this is a new story. If people cant afford groceries why woukd they be able to afford Disney. Duh!
Thanks Trump for making everything more expensive you're the best you fkin clown 🍼🤡
"under the last administration; it's gotten a little bit better" = more gaslighting
Bro hasn't heard about the Disney boycott. Disney is dead.
seems a bargain in comparison to a family day's skiing...
Should of done your research before going there. Common sense people
I don't think you get to go to Disney and complain about it. 🥱
Dude has almost 500k subs himself. Florida resident but didnt get Florida residency passes in those purchase prices. Did it to get views.
no way I would pay that. crazy.
A Disney parks are is a money squeezing machine. This is what happens when bean counters run the parks. There are other amusement parks to go to or better places, like national parks.
Man for a second I thought it was Ron DeSantis!  I loved the daughter's answer to the question about her favorite part of the day at Disney!
MAGA Republicans shouldn't complain or criticize Disney, at all, since that's the cost of supporting an American company with American employees operating in America that Trump wants and tries to increase to make America rich again.
Try going to an NFL game for your next report.
I have family that live in Orlando Florida we go down for vacation every year and we avoid Disney like the plague. I'd rather spend my money in SeaWorld and universal studios just my opinion.
Maybe don’t have kids? Idk
I work at magic kingdom and it’s insane, but we’re always packed. But it’s not Americans it’s mostly foreign visitors keeping the tourism in Orlando up!
disney is screwing us all.the magic is gone
Disney no  VALLE
You can save by not going.
He is exactly correct
Some can't afford "Amusement " parks!
What are they talking about? Disney World has been expensive for the past 20 years or so.
Well, when Disney raise it starting pay to $20 hour. That cost got past to the consumer.
meanwhile, every millennial just goes even without kids because what is cash when we keep getting free cash from investments lol 2018 and 2020 taught us that
You need a 3 day pass to get a discount for a Florida resident. I am the most frugal Disney dad and I can do it real cheap. Dont waste money on the fast pass, it only saves a few minutes each ride because the lines go so fast. Avoid the sit down restaurants and don’t stay in the Disney resorts. I have it down and with my family of 4 I can do it for less than 2k for a week. If you have an autistic kid they will give a fast pass for that and extra perks so keep that in mind too I know a lot of kids are autistic today. An illegal tip is instead of paying to park say you made a wrong turn and need to get back on the road and they will let you pass to turn around then park. I don’t do that anymore but I did when I was young. That’s for those of you with no conscience lol
Disney is always busy which proves its a great place to go.. . There are so many ways to save money... buy an annual pass for as little as 400 a year and it includes parking... Stop spending  50-100 bucks a week going out to eat and have over  3000 year towards your trip... Say no to your normal spending at home and you can afford a trip... Look at the cruises, any cruise line... but yet they stay booked up...  High demand is why prices stay up... We love going to Disney and sometimes you have to prioritize your life to afford it...
No one forced the guy to take his family to Disney World. He's a fool.
Never been, never would go. Don't understand the obsession with that place.
I willing to bet his bill was way more than 1400 bucks. With food and merchandise purchased, closer to 2k
It's good he was a good sport of it, had to money,  and still kept a sense of humor.   Yes, it's definitely expensive, but the memories are priceless.
I remember when all day passes were $15.00!!!! Yeah, I'm oooold!
Somehow I feel that Mr. Disney would be deeply *deeply* disturbed at what his dream for the park has turned into.
Money is not real to these people. As a business owner, Dad  knew this.  We all also know the family gets to be on TV🎉
Capitalists complaining about capitalism. GREED right!??
There’s no need for Disney to charge this much, pure greed.
I would never go!
I will never go there and pay that.
America is not about family values any more. Unless your family is really rich.
This was all pre thought out to get views. FL man shocked ...ya right.
Disney can keep the magic. I can travel out the country for that place and be there for a week.
For that reason we stopped going to Disney California.... Knott's Berry Farm much more reasonable and just as fun.
When my family was running Ripslide in Orlando at some of the Resorts we had families tell us how they had more fun on our giant slide than they had going to Disney World. A giant, inflatable slide that you could ride down like a slip-n-slide and it beat Disney with thousands of families over the years. Love it.
Uhhhhh Free Enterprise…
She said, "...under the last administration." No lady, it's still going on strong.
Dude's a whiney influencer just looking to cash in.  Don't have kids if you can't afford it.  The kids had fun for one day and it cost $200 per kid... bfd.
Well Craig got some free advertising!
8m views? I'd say that probably more than paid for everything!!!
excuse me but prices are on line. Quit whinning
Crazy expensive, but they kept shelling out. PS, note the stupid "journalist" had to go out of her way to LIE about the economy being better now under "the current administration"! LIES lady, it is worse under the orange monster!
To put this into perspective a 100 Families would pay Disney $140.000 thousand dollars for a day out at the park,
take you kids to state park
Disney is awful. They thrive off brand but they don’t care about their guests and most of their rides aren’t good and the food at magic kingdom tastes like it came from a box and was just thrown into the microwave. They raise prices constantly just because they’re greedy which means most kids will never get to go. One of the most corrupt organizations in the country to be completely honest. Go to universal who is actually worth the price and cares about their guests
This sounds like an Onion headline.
Payimg for parking is a scam
Indeed, Disneys the biggest 'man-trap' ever built by a mouse......
Its crowd control due it the popularity of the parks.
And $8 water bottle later lol
well why enter when its already posted in the website how much your going to spend? its no brainer if you dont want to spend money just stay at home or go on a public park ITS FREE.
Wow what a rip off ! Disney has become so greedy and not worth the price
Palace of the elite not the public
She's right. Back in the Biden administration we couldn't afford groceries. Now during the Trump administration we can't even imagine them in our cart... But Disney was pricing everybody out a long time ago. And people seem to have all kinds of money to go there and spend thousands on a mediocre day.
With all the crap going on there, disney is the last place I want to visit
No one forced you to go. You made the decision to spend the money, Disney, or any other themparks like Universal don't force anyone to visit them. You and everyone else have the power to how spend the money no them.
The worst part of this is that you have to pay EVEN MORE if you want to skip the lines, and it used to be free.
People can't afford a lot of things. So go somewhere you can afford.  Old town great option. Gator land great option . And so on ..ya it's a shame .not what Walt intended.  I would start with exex salaries. It's a good old boy club complete with class system and waste. They need to get d.o.g.e.d
They gotta makeup for that snow white movie
Thats for a day trip huh?  Not even a hotel?  I remember growing up in So Cal we could take the bus to Disneyland by ourselves and spend all day in the park for $20.  Just packed our own peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and brought Shasta cola in a backpack.
It’s insane how much it costs now a days. Nowhere near what it was the last time I went. Literally the park tickets cost more than our hotel and flights to get there.
They need the money to make crappy movies
Disgusting corporate greed!!!
I live in FL and have no desire to visit Disney.   The fact that this family, in 15 hours or less, spent more money than I make a month - that makes me physically ill.   I’ll bet the daughter would have loved staying home and playing a board game with the entire family. Plus way cheaper!
Vote with your feet and pocket book.   Go for a nice family hike and picnic.
How is this news?
I went to Disney back in 2016 and I was pulling out $500 a day from the ATM and we were there for about 5 days. That was just to spend in the park and I typically came back with hardly any of it. Disney ahs always been outrageous but it's even worse now. They don't care about families, they care about the bottom dollar like all corporations and they will keep raising the prices as long as people are still spending the money.
I love that they have so many children though. But this is a lot.The lighting pass is a scam bc it doesn’t work for each ride to be honest . They have a magic band I couldn’t find one place for my daughter to use it. He paid 30 for parking we pay $55 to get preferred parking.  It’s a money grab but the kids really do have fun .
Except for the wokies, gays and trans, it's pretty much family friendly
The way he said " it cost me 30 dollars just for parking" makes me think he has never been to a theme park. I have a Six Flags and SeaWorld near me and both charge more for parking.
900$😳
If people cant afford Disney why is it always so crowded? We need to stop going entirely
This is all very strange. Complaining about the cost while still deciding to spend it and whining about it after. Furthermore talking about how many other people chose to spend that kind of money for a memorable day. Seems like a whole bunch of first world, whining, and bitching.
Where has this guy been?
it sucks knowing i have to save up for this for years just to give my kids a trip that i now wont enjoy and they wont have the same experience as i did growing up... Its rough... I say boycott disney 🤦🏻🤷🏻🤷🏻🤷🏻🤷🏻
Doesn't seem worthwhile for just a theme park. There must be cheaper options. I went to Disney Florida years ago and the best time to go is in the evening. After 9pm all the families go away and there's almost no lines. You can go on the rides time after time until they close at midnight.
Don't go. Man, people just need attention, don't they?
They got to make up the loss from Snow White somewhere.
Yes, Disney has been expensive for a while now. But add in the new costs for consumers from the Trump tariffs to food and drinks, materials coming from China because we have no industry to make it, etc. it's now even more expensive. You all should have googled what tariffs would do before voting.
That isn’t that expensive for a day for a huge family……how is this news?
Spend more time on crappy circle rides and less eating!
Put that 1400 towards an RV and go to a national park! That's totally disgusting that shouldn't be 1400, maybe half that price and that is still overpriced. I sincerely hope Disney prices themselves OUT OF BUSINESS. I bet people in China don't pay the 1400.00 equivalent!
high prices keeps the rif raf out.  if it were cheaper it would become a Carnival Cruise fiasco
Where they rob the rich and the poor alike
Hi guys, this is capitalism. An American pulls himself out of poverty, buys Orange Groves and milks the hell out of it for the share holder. You work hard as an American business owner and family man to earn your money and speand it how you want. No one is forcing you to go there if you are "pinching pennies". Do you want us to help you support your three kids? Do we still use the term "snowflake" or has that been replaced. I would support a bill as an adult with no kids, to pay higher taxes to aid your family to go to Disney, I would also support a bill to force these greedy 'Merican corporations to lower their prices so that more families can get the vacations they deserve. Can't have it both ways.
He's got way more money than I do to spend on a day like that.  Not worth it.
Another rich only experience. Seems like that’s the direction everything is heading.
I do kinda wish he did a price breakdown instead of doing just totals.  I understand click bait shock value and all.
I wouldn’t go there even I got free tickets.
WOW!!! THE DAUGHTER ANSWER ABOUT WHAT SHE ENJOYED MOST ABOUT HER DAY IN DISNEY, THIS IS WHY I DO WHAT I DO AS A FATHER!! FAMILY AND LEGACY IS EVERYTHING!!! FAMILY EXPERIENCES IS EVERYTHING!!! PEACE!!!💜✌🏾🙏🏾
And the groomers of Disney...thank you.  Someone hase to pay for their woke, failed garbage..
Sucks! My kids always wanted to go n I always wanted to take them being I was taken to Disney as a kid, but it’s tooo expensive!! Maybe one day
Why would anyone want to visit an amusement park in a country run by criminal rapists and fraudsters.  No way would I visit America because I am afraid of ICE deporting me to El Salvador.
She snuck in. "under the last administration..."    Lady is a Legend!!!
Disney isn't worth the price!
Why would anyone want to visit the US , the whole country is run the same way as disney only for the rich.
Thank GOD my sister works at Disney I get in free
Craig hasn't lived in Florida very long, he and hs family moved here last year. He's a You Tuber and a small business owner. Most Floridians stay far away from Disney, because at this point, we know it's not worth it!
. Don't waste your money.
You choose to go, you choose to pay. Your own problem. If a banana is $20, don't buy it.
I would never waste my money on Disney.
😂 the news reporter trying to gaslight us by saying the last administration was more expensive for stuff and it's getting better under trump 😂 B!tch please ! It's getting worse under trump with his trade wars and on and off tariffs 😂 not to mention the tax cuts that only help billionaires.  The thousands he has laid off from the federal government. Can't wait to see his numbers of unemployment 🤦🏻‍♀️😳🙄he might just have to dismantle that department that tracks that so they can't report on it😂
Disney needs to recoup their losses from that Snow White movie
the light saber are made in china, MAGA will make it 145% more😂
Yeah, I watch this guy’s videos. He sells cars. He is a very likable person. I enjoy his videos.
Just not worth it……unless you like queuing
Under last administration what a joke 😂
"It's gonnen a lil bit better" under Trump? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Disney way to expensive. They are greedy and woke. All they do is try to squeeze as much money as they can out of their guest. Vote with your dollar don’t buy Disney tickets
Dude didn't try anything to save money. As someone who vacations to Disney on a fairly regular basis he made every mistake possible and I would argue he tried to see how much he could spend. Also the end portion of the video when the ear dinner is at Disney Springs not Disney World. They basically are at a mall restaurant.
has dad been living under a rock?
It’s sad that a place marketed for children is so out of reach for so many because it’s so unaffordable.
Honestly, Disney is not that expensive. The current price for an adult 4 day Florida resident ticket this summer is $260. Kids ages 3-10 are half off this summer. That is literally half the cost of Universal parks. I was looking yesterday and saw rooms at the value hotels for a little over $135.   So realistically, a trip for a week is like a 1k budget. That is not at all unreasonable, not in the USA today! If you were out of state (not as a Floridian) you'd be paying airfare (very expensive), hotel, non-discounted ticket, and non-discounted hotel. Out of state visitors easily pay an extra 1-2k to see disney world. Disney is actually quite nice to Florida travelers because Disney always gave Floridians "good neighbors discounts" because Florida basically gave Disney everything they wanted on construction. Unlike LA or California who really didn't work with Disney, Florida more or less sold them enough land to have nightly fireworks, multiple parks, many resorts, etc.   So 4 years ago I think I bought that same ticket for $210. The tickets went up $50 in 4 years. Considering inflation on everything else I'd say that barely even rose for inflation. If you bought the day ticket it's $179. Under no circumstances does the day ticket ever make financial sense (except if you have the budget to do it and only want one day period, maybe a senior citizen). You either need to purchase a 4 day ticket, season pass, or annual. Universal too! It winds up cheaper.   It would cost me $1400 even to drive up to the Carolinas and stay in cabins, eat out. Idk. I think 1-2k is a realistic budget for ANY domestic trip. In fact, this year I can't fly to NYC or Chicago without paying $400.   I'm not about to fly on those planes crashing from the sky either. I want a real plane. A plane that passed inspection, so that's $400 on Delta/AA. Honestly, if you said airlines I'd agree with you. It's madness. I cannot even go to Denver any more because it costs what an international trip would to travel domestically between states. California costs the same as me flying to London. It's ridiculous airfare in this country! Europe pays half of us continentally.   *The prices listed are in June, July, August, and part of September they have $260 tickets and kids half off. Not a bad deal at all IMO. You could get tickets for everyone for around $700-$1000 for a family of 4. On a normal year or for out of state people it'd be double this. Universal is factually more expensive. You did not report that, only picked on Disney.  It's a trend though to pick on only Disney. All of corporate America is expensive, the worst are the groceries now. Disney is actually leisure expense nobody has to purchase and there are definitely ways to budget this summer. I'm looking at them now actually.
You have to be a fool to spend that sort of money for one day. Wow...
Over rated! Never would I pay this much for a day of wokeness.
My family visited Disneyland in late 1963 and again in early 1964.  Prices were more reasonable back then, and we had a great time.  Walt Disney was still alive at that time and I believe it showed.  Knott’s Berry Farm was a fair option, and we always had a great meal finishing off with boysenberry pie.  Even Knott’s is on board the corporate greed train these days.
They could at the very least make parking free. Charging to park should be a crime.
It's always been disgusting..  Same for every other "family" amusement park from the 90s on.. prices just skyrocketed to ridiculous amounts
Add airfare, hotel and rental car…there’s enough $$$ for 2 years at Community College!
Disney is trying to make up the loss for that horrific Snow I identify as white and the seven transgender’s movie.
Gangster Mickey
Universal cost more. We are locals and we have platinum annual passes for Seaworld/Busch Gardens/Aquatica. It's only 99.00 a month for all 3 of us. Plus we get free tickets every month. I work at Disney so my family gets to go for free. If I didn't work there, we wouldn't be going. LOL
Slow news day huh?  In other news, water is wet.
Never going back.   Biggest ripoff ever.  They could care less about anything other than your money.  8 dollar bottle of water too!
It's Disney. It's awesome. Happiest Place on Earth. Deal with it... They've been charging almost that much for parking for YEARS!
...and Americans continue to move toward a place where once 'normal' activities will only be available to the upper middle class or above. At least the daughter had a positive answer at the end of the video.
4495 for lightsaber you can go to Walmart and get one for $9.95 tell me Disney ain't ripping off people
In 1984 I took my girlfriend and her 3 kids to Disneyland. The whole day cost me less than $100.
It’s a scam. No longer affordable for average families.
Still seemed busy! People are still paying for this. Disney is laughing all the way to the bank
Didn't he research this stuff before he decided to take them? Stupid is as stupid does.
From 🇬🇧went to America, Disney 20yrs ago,2children,2adults..paid less then 2000,all inclusive..2weeks To stay me that was expensive, but now..wow!!!!!!
You should have bought the toys, $1,400 vs $1,500. At that point, who cares about $100. Funny, Disney's stock just went up 10%. Maybe if I invested in the company, I could afford to go there with the profits. Either way, Disney wins.
Well the news lady is a racist bastard that I know regardless of cost of Disney.
FOX has crossed the line into influencer reporters! Paid nonetheless! How many views will this spot garner for the influencers?
His daughter said the best part was standing in line and talking amongst the family. In other words …no cell phones, no TikTok, no swiping right or left, no texting, no selfies, and no instagram. 📱🫷🏼
🎶 🎶it’s a greedy world after all It’s a money making world after all…🎶🎶
They only want to upper, upper class to come to their park.    Drive the price up to where 90% cannot afford it…..simple way to keep the unwashed masses out.
What a depressing trip. No way I could enjoy myself with those prices; I would have been sick the entire trip.
Flying wheels 🎉
Disney was one and done and it sucked.
This has nothing to do with who's in the White House, idiot. It has everything to do with corporate greed.
Would universal be cheaper?
You pay far more for a one-day pass for that day than you would per day for a multi-day pass.  This is a pricey way to get park admission.  Yes, it is very expensive to go there and even more expensive to stay in their hotels.  They made a decision that charging more, a lot more, would bring in more money and also bring in a clientele likely to drop more cash on food and merchandise.  So far they have been 100% correct.  I have been many time and the last time I went the parks seemed, for the first time, a little run down.  Some litter in places, plantings that were dead and needed to be replaced, things ready for fresh paint.  There is no reason for this. If they claim to be a superior product they need to back that up.  And if you think this is bad, a lift ticket to ski at big Western resorts will run you about $300 for one day.  $1,200 for a family of four.
Disney is getting ridiculous with prices... so greedy 💔
Disney a prime example of Corporate Greed!💰🎩💰
My family has never been and dont plan to go. I think its an asinine price to pay for the whole day for an amusement park. I could put that money to way better use.
We spend $55 a person for local fair tickets. $25 for parking and lots for food! Then small fair in town isn’t cheap either! Have you bought concert tickets? So Disney ain’t the only one!!!!!
Don't go.simple really
But remember, Disney needs to make a massive profit at Disney World to help offset the enormous financial losses it incurs when they release a Woke movie!
He is not lying. It is crazy expensive now.
We went ONCE when my daughter was 4, she's 29 now... It was expensive then, too!
NEVER BEEN! NEVER WILL GO! I DON'T SUPPORT NAZIS AND CRIMINALS
Nowdays children should play wity AI with their gadgets.. they can go to the disney virtually with their gadget minds.. the AI infrastructure with AI chips will be the future business
The lines are crazy. When I went we had to wait on average 45mins per ride and we had handicap passes. The people who didn’t have flash passes was waiting for a 1 hour and 15mins. It was the worst trip ever.
Disney Paris is better on the wallet! Dont waste your money in the US/TRUMP LAND 😂
Try coming from another state and paying , flight, hotel AND all for the stuff at the park
Disney isn't the only game in town. Do a Google search instead of complaining. Plenty to do in Florida besides Disney. Most families can't afford to put food on the table,and your whining about it costing so much.
That is robbery.  $1000 for 5 people in the park?  Hell no.
As a kid I’ve been to Disneyland once and to Disneyworld never. As an adult been back to Disneyland never and to Disneyworld once.
As long as the parks are packed with people and the attraction lines are long, expect Disney to continue raising their prices.
You should know the prices ahead of time and if you aren’t checking then that’s on you.   You have to live under a rock to think Disney let alone any big theme parks are affordable anymore for middle class families.
Stop going
The answer from the daughter was priceless 😢
I still paying last year vacation..
$1,400 will get a wild ride a DIDDYsLAND. It is a night theme park.
No more woke Disney.
Thank you Craig! Finally, we as Americans need to wake up to this!  Disney is a complete and total tourist trap.  And what do you get in return?  Lines and lines and lines! $$$$
A friend of mine took his 3 kids and wife to disney world for 3 days. He knew it would be expensive, so he budgeted $5,000 for the trip. He ended up spending $7,200. The next vacation he took was to 6 Flags. He spent less than $1,000 on that trip, which included hotel stays.
I know of people that have spent WAY MORE MONEY than he did.   It’s been a long time thing of SAVING UP TO $3000 to take your family to Walt Disney World. Soooo he didn’t do his research well enough. 👀💅🏾🤣💯
You went to a major tourist spot guy what did you expect. 1k for a family of 5. Get over it
Money ruins everything
Bro you said it was 7 of you what the f do you expect
Great hack job of Disney! BUT FOX DOESN'T CARE TRUMP SPENDS MILLIONS TO GOLF! TRUMPS GOVERNMENT OVER SPENT 220+ BILLION OVER  BUDGET IN 100 DAYS!
Florida is a corrupt lawless swamp full of sociopaths and MAGAts.
What a stupid and moronic father. A complete and utter disgrace of a man. This wimp chose to go to Disney and all of a sudden he is shocked by the prices?? First of all, men need to do better with money, next if you plan a trip, be aware of all costs associated with that trip, and finally, stay off of social media because it's makes men look cowardly when they cry about putting a smile on kids faces which  can sometimes cost money. Shame on this dad for being a complaining Karen.
I remember going to universal and Disney when I was a kid I remember the expensive prices but I remember universal pay for one day you get second day free that was the way to go I was a teenager at that point so Disney world was kinda lame anyways
I wouldn't pay for a vacation with this company even if it cost $1.
Add that to Flying from England as well!! Such a RIP OFF!! Fan of Flying Wheels.
Well the CEO knows all that people will pay & it could be possibly that he’s thinking, why not? Right? it’s greed that’s the driving force behind these prices. Simple as that corporate GREED !!!
My family was priced out years ago
You should see how much it costs us including flights and everything else to enjoy Disney World and Universal as we live in the UK, have to say we still pay whatever it takes because we LOVE Florida so much ❤
Dude is thirsty for attention! Of course it is priced as Supply and Demand drive the costs. Did you and your family have a good time or did you go there with the intent of trying to get your YouTube channel publicized? Bruh, stop being a whiny lil man!
I’m not going to Disney land
I think disney should have set numbers for visitors so that by  pay much but at least have time to enjoy rides instead of waiting in line😢
It cost to have fun 😂
I go every other year with my family, the cost has certainly gone up, but the cost of everything has gone up, so I don't understand the complaint. The costs of things always go up, that's how life works 😂.
F DISNEY
That family was lucky to have that kind of money to spend I know lots of families that do not not including my self my social security is less than what they spent. When I used to take my nieces I thought it was expensive but no one put a gun to my head and made me to it. My nieces now take their children there with their fond memories.
That is ridiculous.  Disney should be ASHAMED!  I quit going to these type places years ago just because the outrageous price of everything. Even Dollywood is a joke!  How does low income families afford this luxury.  It ought to be against the law to charge like these places do.  The food inside these parks is a joke - the price and then most times it is not even good. Pure greed is what it is.
What do you expect 🤷if you go to Disney 🤷🦃🦃🦃🦃🦃🦃🦃 the answer is don't go to Disney 😂😂 don't be a dumbo😂😂😂😂
If the they can’t control the prices then soon Disney will lost all the tourists because right now everything is very costly, I went to Disney 6years ago and also wanted to last winter but because of high cost we skipped it and went somewhere else
We went to Universal in 2023. I just found my old receipt. It was $770 to get in with fast passes. Then another $300 on food and etc. I already expect to pay $1000 when we go to Florida. Family of 3. I know people spending $1000 in Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. My son likes the theme parks but my wife not so much.
There's nothing appealing about Disney these days. Spend all that money just to stand in line for a lame ride? There are cheaper parks with better rides.
It’s horrible. Only rich families can go to Disney now. Pathetic and sad.
I spent 10k last august for a family of 5 and I stayed in the campground in my own camper.
But you get all the free puberty blockers you want
THEN STOP GOING, boycott.  Simple economics, if demand stays, costs stay 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
that's what it cost for me and my girl
Grocery prices have increased in the last few months.  What a biased report.
Costs you about £1000 to take a family if ur going to eat there and do most things.  Not surprised at all cost us £3000 for a week back in the very early 90’s. Its not like you go weekly its a yearly trip at most.
Choice. 100% pure choice.
Better with this administration? How delusional... Maybe she doesn't have a 401k.
Thankfully me or my family never have or wanted to go.  I always said to me children I could just buy you a dirt bike instead,  used bike was a whole lot cheaper. Probably a whole lot "safer" for your kids.
You are making up for all of us that walked away from Disney.
Does Fox hire  non-blondes with not perfect gleaming white teeth  and not white in skin color.?   This family soon will even have less to spend thanks to the Trump Tariffs .
I'm a Florida native and you couldn't pay me to go to a theme park it's for tourists and Northerners who move here which is just about everybody anymore
Woke/DEI disney 😂 Still indoctrinating your family
I mean those prices are  shocking? Tickets for Florida residents have been over or close to 150 since the mid 2000s.  And if you can or have the OPTION to do it for a family of 5 , you're not pinching Penny's. 😂😂😂 if you can consider getting lightning passes you are not pinching penny. It's not your right to go to disney😂😂😂. And this was an unplanned trip for him. Get out of here. 😅People who can't afford it won't be going. 😂😂😂. These are rich people problems. Maybe choose Busch Gardens next time or something else that's in your budget😂
Remember folks, it’s the happiest place on earth.
Its to finance the Snow White remake flop....
Only Asian people can afford a trip to Disneyland.
Star wars galaxy's edge in Disney was a minimum of $4800 for 2 nights for 2 people to stay in a completely not star wars surrounding...no recognizable star wars characters or sets...then add extras to enhance your experience..suprise suprise it's now shut down.
What??? The.... F..
dont go
yup it is overpriced.
2000$ CAN without flights!
Seems Disney doesn’t want average Joe, just money folks.
I quit going to Disneyland 20 years ago. I saved a lot of money.
Fleeced
Talk about fleecing an already under fire public trying to get at least a trip of a "lifetime". You have to ask if it's actually "worth it?". Everybody's looking to get a bargain at the end of the day but I don't think "Disney" got the memo.
It's the lines (and the cost obviously) that bother me. All that money and spend 4-5 hours in lines for maybe 20-30 minutes of rides. My best ever was a visit to Orlando in the early 2000s, we were on literally one of the first planes to land after a hurricane hit Florida and one of the last planes of the day late at night. Went to universal the next day and there were maybe a few hundred people in the park. The Back to the Future ride, when we came out of it, walked down the staircase and we went straight back in to the ride with zero queue. It was like that all day on every ride. Disney the next day was similar, but a bit busier - by day 3 back to normal.
Place is a ripoff
HE SHOULDVE TOLD HIS LAZY WIFE TO HELP OUT. WHAT A SIMP.
Too crowded but it’s not worth paying that much.
$1,400 to walk around a park for a day? F that.
Disney is not worth it anymore. Greed has ruined them. People cutting in line. Lines are too long and allow too many people into the parks at one time. I'm done with Disney.
He said pinch pennies yet spent $1400 in an amusement park 😂
Hey moron, you had to hav known of these prices/ horror ripoff stories ahead of time….. there is this thing called the internet.     All that being said, why feed this  over rated thing. Should have found a cheaper alternative and put the savings in the college acct.
$30 for captive parking- because they can; that is horrible.
At least no need for express tickets as the lunatic president has scared off foreign visitors.  Incidentally that price would get you an entire weeks family entry to Port Aventura in Spain and the greeting and food are far superior.
Setting your money on fire with extra steps.
Fox News can’t resist dinging the previous presidential term and making the current one seem so much better. How about leaving politics out of it?
There are plenty of other places to go other than WOKE DISNEY
1400 for one day? That’s nuts.
A fool and his money are soon parted! Say no to Disney! It is not worth it!
Lol. People gone keep paying it until the end.
I'm so glad i have every intention on not going to Disneyland.. EVER!
China is laughing 😂
Disney is disgusting
This is how woke disney can keep pumping out DEI propaganda movies to brainwash the younger generations. People have got to stop given them money.
Imagine paying that kind of money just to wait in line all day.
This woke company  is just creedy, sucking the blood out of american families. Shame on you.  Boykott it like snow white. We are done with Disney.
This is a bs story. 1. Kids in Florida go to Disney on school trips. Mine went in the 8th grade. (If it's that important to you, be a chaperone for that trip.) 2. For most people, Disney is a one time trip and your Busch Gardens cheap a$$ ruined it. 👍
Dad didn't look up the prices before going there?    Doing anything with 5 people isn't cheap.   Try paying for 5 escorts in Vegas for your friends.
Did a child let adults know having a family is great
Ive been to DW twice. That place is highway robbery. Cool place but mannn u will pay for it. Then its hard to enjoy it because its 400 degreez outside.
Cry Baby
Universal Studios for the win.
You paid it still
Sure glad I favored Rat Fink as opposed to Mickey as a kid! RIP Big Daddy.
For a day? Universal in Japan I only spent 300 total a day! And it’s better than there..
This guy is a Florida resident. I am as well and Disney does right by in state residents. The annual pass for residents is $400 per person then they can go whenever just not weekends. I know it’s still expensive to go there.
In South Africa that would be R 30.000
1400 dollars in 1 day is too much, i am not an american but for us, we spend those amount on basic necessities, bills, etc...we only do spend when we need to... 1400 is too much though...like really too much...
Wow That Is Expensive For One Day But Do You Know What Positive Memorys Have Been Made. God Bless Us All Amen XXX And God Bless Our Earthly Life Tiimes Amen XXX And God Bless Our Earthly Familys Amen XXX
Why would you support anything Disney?😂😂😂 we been boycotting that company 😊
Just like these people that “go viral” posting a mcdonalds receipts on how expensive their slop is. The menu prices are there and you STILL bought it. This guy had access to all of the prices, except the souvenir shops, and still went with the purchase. Hey buddy, when you see the price tag for a dozen eggs, don’t think it’s gonna change to $1.50 at the register
Did she really say that it’s gotten easier to buy groceries under this administration??😂 it was bad before and is now somehow catastrophically worse.
Oh my god!!!! That’s my rent payment 🤦🏼‍♀️it’s sad I’ve never been there and im on my 60 year old 😉 I’ll guess I’ll never go it’s to expensive and things are going up 😱 God bless you and your beautiful family
That's because you have a large family
Wonderful the Tariffs are effective now, Americans can no longer afford anything.
It’s the most ripping you off place on Earth.
The TV interview er says that high grocery prices have gotten better since the last administration, but where???? Under trump, groceries have just continued to cost more!!!
The kid wouldn't wear the ears? She knows she's a little girl right? YouTube deletes comments violating 1st amendment,
Forgot the $1,400. Bringing a child to that place is already a mistake. Doesn't he know about the evil intent Disney has towards children?
Any yet he still paid 😂.....simply don't go, it's not rocket science.
High prices keeb the riff-raff out. What you're paying is a a fee for an experience unmarred by the usual suspects.
"Under the last administration".  Bonespurs bootlickers...
This is why I dont have kids!@ Kids are a luxury at these prices. This is out of reach for poorer families. At least single I can afford myself...
People who live there locally, have season/annual passes and are using it as a daily gang out place, thats why its overcrowded with more people. Imagine half a big town there daily😮. I heard from asians at a 2015 Con in the area, that the young asians thru their early 20s till college, and during, go/do it like how the rest of the kids in the country hung out free at the malls. Its insane, but their parents must be wealthy and just have money to blow.
I work at Disney California Adventure.  I get to go to either park whenever I want for free.  There’s also a discount for some of the restaurants and swag.  How often do I go?  Maybe once or twice a year.  I think Disney is way overpriced and it’s designed that way.  Before C-19, I kept an annual pass.  It has gone from $175 to $900 over the past 15 years.  As time went on everything started to have a price.  Before Lightning Lane, there was Fast Pass.  Fast Pass was free.  Disneyland was considered a local’s amusement park, like Knott’s Berry Farm, which is about 10 minutes away and so much less expensive.  It also has better food and can be a lot more fun.  Now Disney is trying to become a vacation destination.  They’re adding two more ‘lands’ on the property and they’re trying to get the Angles to move from Anaheim Stadium to take over that property for another park.  Ok, rant over.
😮 Absolutely crazy !!
Typical american zombie.🤪😝😛 giving away his harder earned money to a woke demon corporation..👹🤡💰💰💰        💔🇺🇸
we helped our mother save up for years to go and she decides not to after all the hassle.  She went shopping instead.
I feel terrible for saying this because I'm really not trying to rub salt in the wound but just to put it into prospective !!!!! I paid pretty much the exact same price for my child and I to spend Fourteen nights staying at Disneyland pop century, flying from LONDON on good flights with virgin including all main meals and park access with early park entry. How is this fair????? This was precovid so maybe it's changed drastically and the hotel we were in wasn't fancy but it seems so unfair that local families are having to pay this. It's so unfair.
So, you didn't know how expensive DL is? It was expensive in the early 90's when I took my kids. Like he didn't know. 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
99.9 percent love disney
Sticking it to the people because I can 👍
This is for rich tourists. Ah, but that child's answer-priceless!
Dont worry for craig ( the dad) he has a you tube channel " flying wheels' and no doubt with the logo in the background he will deduct the trips costs as " advertising " for his channel on his tax return.
...and it will keep going up because people keep paying it. Stop going.
Never been, i guess i was born with logic
Dad obviously doesn't pay for competition cheerleading....😏
I love tea cup
I don't go to theme parks. I live in Hawaii. If you want to go to Disney, go to dishland in Japan it is much cheaper. I'm telling you in america everything's expensive
E
no one made him go, yet he complains about the pricing.
Universal Studios is a much better deal. Disney has lost my business because of their greed.
Geez a month of rent 4 just 1 day of fun smfh
Yes it’s expensive but this was also very poor planning. Also, as a park visitor I rather not have ALL families visiting.
Parents should break out of the mould what the corporate world wants us to spend on. A fun and good childhood doesn't have to be a trip to disney.  Corporate twists parents arm by using our kids who is bombarded with every possible ads and stuff. Its important parents hold their ground and give proper education to their kids. I mean mine is pretty stoked with going to the zoo, watching a movie or hangout at local cafes. The most important is the bonding and us as parents teaching valuable life lessons that they will remember for life. Those are the things that will set them up for life
What a waste of money for dummies who will pay it lol.
I would go to Dollywood instead
Have you considered having more kids
My husband and I went to Disney on our honeymoon in 1993. I was 18 and he was 21. We went to all the Disney parks plus Sea World and Universal Studios and stayed in a fairly cheap but still decent motel. We were so busy we lost track of days at one point, being there for about 9 days straight. You wouldn’t believe how much cheaper it was then! Too bad Disney has gotten so greedy.
$30 for parking - that is way too much
Waaaah, I'm too poor to go to disney, waaaaah.  Poor baby
a little research goes a long way BEFORE you commit .  wake up
Goodness gracious, I would not contribute a penny to a woke kingdom. I’ll go to Hershey park.
Everyone is complaining about how it’s not worth it, but it’s so packed and the line is so long even at this price.
You're an idiot if you go to Disney.
I have been off/on to Disney land at different times in my life, it has and will always be enjoyable.  No matter the cost at that time it is not  a trip one does every year due to cost factor.  Prices to operate have gone up including wages, food, hotel, etc. they are doing what is needed to stay in business.  And even back decades ago it was considered  in our family budget not cheap, we made plans for a long time and saved.  Six Flags is closing due to change in venues and costs, the is the last hold out, so try and work with them or do not go.  It is a place to escape reality of the day, enjoy it while it is still in operation.
There is no value to Disney anymore.
"Lightening" refers to the weight of your wallet.
Don't f@#$%ing go dammit
Trump put tarrifs on Disney tickets!!! That's why they are so expensive!! Good job maga!
Disney have the people with the deep pockets who keep coming back they are not interested in the little people
There you are  , you have just created a GDP of $1400. That's how America had the largest GDP in the world.
The answer the daughter gave warmed my heart actually. 💓🫶🇬🇧
Amazing how he is pushing his YouTube channel with the plaque and sign and T-shirt…… incredible. And stop complaining. Disney has always been extremely expensive so get over it. What a fluff piece.
How dumb do you have to be to think the Biden administration has anything to do at all with the cost of Disney prices ?   Disney has always been over priced and they know people will pay whatever Disney charges .    If we stop going Disney may stop raising their prices
Why is someone complaining about paying this price news?? If you have 1400 to pay for fun your not PINCHING PENNIES
Can't resist lying that things have gotten a bit better under Trump.
Wow parking FOR 30 BUCKS FOR parking? We don't have that here in the Philippines.. that's insane!
Then just don't go to Disney World. Easy as that.
Disney is absurdly expensive. Fortunately, I live in France, not too far from Disneyland Paris. French companies often offer various entertainment and/or travel benefits to their employees. For medium sized companies, that could be discount movie/theater/museum tickets, reduced gym memberships, etc. My wife works for a large corporation that privatizes Disneyland Paris annually beginning December as a Christmas/New Year party. It's a bit chilly that time of the year but there's unlimited coffee and hot chocolate as well as snacks. Nobody waits in line more than 10 minutes. I know other French corporations also privatize Disneyland Paris. We could also choose to go to a local amusement parc (Parc Astérix), the circus, etc. One year, we attended the "Lion King" musical. My wife hit the jackpot with her job cause we also have discounts for airlines, car rentals and hotels. Through her company, our children each get about 150 euro gift card as a Christmas gift. I'm not saying all this to brag but to tell you there are alternatives to the American way of life. In France, society is structured in a way that people can enjoy a certain quality of life without breaking the bank. It's a choice. Back in the US, I couldn't afford to have as much fun.
Any serious novel vacation (theme parks, airfare, hotel, concerts, etc.) factored out to about $1000 a day for my small family. I was shocked how comparable all the overall costs are for popular trips.  Camping vacations are a budget way to do things but camping is not super cheap anymore.
Their films and tv series are doing so badly, they have to get the money from somewhere else. It is crazy what they are charging in these places now. Everything is stupidly overpriced. Parking charges, food and drinks, merchandise. Pure greed. And you seem to spend most of your time there now in ridiculously long lines. The people it was aimed at are now finding it increasingly hard to go to.
Cool that he wore the ears, Great dad.
It's been like that for a long time. I stopped going  over 15 years ago with my two boys.
It's an expensive world after all!
Forget that. I would rather go to Cedar Point. I would have more fun there than the boring flat rides at Disney and it is cheaper.
I wouldn't go to Disney if they paid me. It's disgusting
It's not only corporate, it's Trump
I don’t know… I’ve heard worse stories than this… 300$ each isn’t THAT bad….a full day at a theme park for a family of 5 what do you expect?
Just don't go.  If all the adult children in America would stop pumping their money into the park then prices would come down.
We were there last year. Its ridiculous how expense its become. They seem to be more about money,than your enjoyment.
Take your kids to see woke low iq deviants what are you stupid ?
😅😂
Wanted those hire prices. Ya won. maga!😂
Get your credit and out and then pay for it for the next year or two.
Being a DVC member or having a annual pass is the key
🤣🤣🤣 Make America Great Again 🤣🤣🤣
You realize how prices would be during the Golden Age?!
Dizzney is a total ripoff. Woke ideology on steroids
He would have been better off buying shares in the company
WAIT UNTIL THE TARIFFS KICK IN 😂😂😂😂😂
Disneyland = Democratic......................Stay the hell away and Stop milking STARWARS, 1977 - 48 YEARS
Disney is a once in a lifetime trip.  Only one is enough.
The price and long lines  =  The horror of it all !
the price of groceries have gone down under trump..
capitalists complaining about capitalism lol
$1400? That's a week at Ocean City.
Fox is a joke somehow they managed to kiss trumps azz again by saying prices are better than the last presidential administrations. That’s a complete lie everything’s already more expensive  I’ve been buying pc parts at microcenter for years and I noticed pc part prices are already going up 10 to 25 percent on most items and when I asked employees what was going on they said it’s just the beginning once all stock in the U.S warehouses is depleted we’re really going to feel it.
I can think of so many better things to do with that money
Stay HOME.
Disney has always been expensive always telling what’s already been told.
Back in the early 90s, Fl residents paid $25 to enter a DW theme park.
Did she try to blame the last administration..shady
Always a rip off Always Disney what kind of family goes to a place where they hire pervert?
Fox news and Disney both disgust me
The cute little girl was very happy 🙂
How else are they supposed to pay for those loud mouth political actresses ! Snow flakes and the 7 cgi's 😂
Taking a family to a pro sports event will almost cost you as much. At least with Disney you don’t have to deal with a bunch of over hyped drunks.
STOP GOING TO DISNEY.
Disney has to recoup for the financial disaster of the Snow White film.
disney no longer caters to families.. we see this more clearly now.. there are better places to take our kids.. beach days are great 🌺🩵🏖️
Fox makes me sick but the girl at the end is wise.
Why is the park still packed when prices are outrageous? WAKE UP STUPID WHITE PEOPLE!  I didn't want to bring color into it, but it's always mostly caucasian that spend this kind of money. Look at the crowds at overpriced  sporting events.
I’ve lived in Florida for the past 11 years and I will never take my family to Disney for several reasons. Mainly though, the prices are just absolutely NOT worth the experience. I’ve taken my family to many of the other amusement parks here though like Busch Gardens, LEGOLAND and Sea World. As expensive as those can also be, the experience is worth it to me. But Disney World…nope you can have that place, they aren’t getting my business.
It's called inflation people. Nothing stays the same. Disney has overhead, utilities, as well as other fees. Several grand out of a year salary between both parents wont break the bank so either deal with or don't go.
this guy has a YouTube channel about his used car lot.  Disney has been using price as a crowd control device for decades, this is not news.
My memories from going to Disneyland from 1978-2013 are free. Went about 25 times. If they bring back Military Discount, I'll go.Maybe.
A whole day hearing him complaining “what a rip off”… divorce coming.
I'm all for doubling the cost if it reduces the crowd...
Imagine being at Disney and the best moment is standing in line and talking to family . Says a lot about how much we don’t connect in real life, even as a family.
I hope Disney! Give a Forever PASS to them!
Disney alway has been expensive nothing new. The way these politically bias news networks depict things is sickening.  Disney is left so outrage over the price. The talk of present day groceries (which i am paying more for than ever) quick rebuttal "its getting a little better : then a sly snarky comment against previous administration.  These networks theieve on pitting the political parties against each other
Have to be brain dead to pay that much
And you happily paid for it. Why lower the price when so many people are willing to pay?
No way fck Disney
Moral of the story, don’t have 5 children and expect anything to be cheap. Go cry to your mother about it or better yet, wrap it up dude. 5 kids and you wanna spend $400 on a family vacation? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 what a fool
It’s fox fault
I got uncles and cousins who take their families yearly. As a matter of fact my uncle and his five kids and wife plus my one cousin's wife and two kids and my other cousins husband and kid totalling thirteen people. Only three are small kids the rest are fifteen and up. I can imagine their bill
Whats more ridiculous is people, buy season passes to go overvandvover again.
Wait disney world is expensive.  . . No one told me this.
Supporter of Donald and friends? lol
$245.00 Dinner for a family of 5, isn’t so bad. Just don’t go and stop whining.
These new people that took over the Disney Corporation are so corrupt.. I remember in the 60s when my mom and dad took us to Disneyland in Anaheim California.. my father paid $6 for each me and my brother and my sister.. and it was an incredible experience.. it was not expensive at all.. the parking was $3 and we all ate there for about $15 that included my mom and my dad and me and my brother and sister.. now it is extremely corrupt with these new people that took over the corporation they are of the devil.. they have ruined and destroyed everything.. they are from the woke generation.. such a horrible group of people.. evil as hell.. they are destroying everything in our country.. these people need to be ousted out.. the problem is these dumb Americans keep paying this money.. they should protest they should boycott Disney completely.. this will force Disney to drop their prices.. but these American people don't stick together instead they betray each other constantly just like this government constantly betraying each other.. China and Russia and other countries laugh at us so badly. Such a foolish country full of fools..
dude it’s the happiest place on earth it wasn’t gonna be cheap lmaoo
Wow the dad’s valid for exposing this bs… I went my first time as an adult and it was a nightmare… over crowded, long lines and this was at night time. The worker claimed my daughter could get on a ride but after waiting for an hour we got to front of the line and she ended up getting denied due to her height. Minnie mouse ears were $25
That is absolutely an insane amount of money, wasn't Disney supposed to be a destiny family oriented?
I think for most people Disney has always been their happy place. The memories are priceless. They used to make you feel special and happy.  It’s a shame that the regular family who works hard and wants to go somewhere that is(was)a magical place and can’t afford it. Walt is surely turning over in his grave. You all should be ashamed of yourselves. But I’m pretty sure you are not.
Branson Missouri Silver dollar City.   Best park in the world
im watching from n.z and all i can say its shoot that's way to much even from someone who's used to high prices.  id tell my child no to at $50 for a toy
I remember one time our company got 10 free tickets for Disneyland I gave two to my favorite bartender and his girlfriend and one to w Uber driver and his son. Not knowing I was literally handing out gold. My bartender didn't charge me drinks for a month.
The sad part is you get the same crap but yet they rob you  for more money and we so silly that we still overpay for it. Let common sense kick it because it's free.  The visitors going can control the outcome if you don't show up
Total RIPOFF!!!!
Im 30 and still haven’t Been I would love to go but if it cost a arm and a leg then its not going to happen 🙅
NO! It has NOT gotten better under this administration SMH. Forgot what news program this is.
Disney World/Disney Land is literally hell for any dad
Disney needs to close. RIP off
In other news, water is wet
If you think it's too expensive then stop going 🤷‍♂️.
It's DEIsny world.
Amusement park for familly's where familliy's cant  ome bc its to expensive😂😂😂😂 cant make this up
What would cheapskate donny two dolls do? Leave Eric and Tiffany outside and get Melaniea to pay for Barron.
I boycotted Disney 40+ years ago - the signs were there.  Disney is effen evil.
You pay all that money to get in, yet spend a large percentage of your day in long queues, made worse by the fact that 'richer' people pay more to jump the queue (aka. fast track). On a busy day on average how many large rides (without fast track) are actually possible?
It is now the 1percenters park.
I went to Disneyland 40 yrs ago and was shocked at the ticket prices back then. So who and how are thousands of people attending!? Everyone is whining can’t afford food but they’re going to Disney??? Recently I looked at cost of Disney Safari hotel for a few nights and it was $4500 just for the hotel and entrance! For two people! Everything else was additional and costly.
Just another of those places that excludes “poor” kids👍
Disney paris is so expessive as well
I Am 61. It is Some Real Sad Times 😅 😂We Are Living 2025.
I got Mickey ears at Amazon
Not sure the point of this post. I'm not at all surprised by these figures. Is anybody surprised at the prices? Anyone?
Unacceptable
I’ve lived in Central Florida for over 50 yrs.  My father used to do freelance press/media work for Disney, back in the day.  When we moved here, Disney had only been opened for three years.  The cost of admission was $3.50 for adults.  Those were the days when you had to buy a ticket book for a ticket for each ride.  We called ourselves Disney kids.  We grew up with Disney, in all its forms; parks, movies, tv shows, merchandise, etc..    My family was priced out of being able to go to Disney decades ago; even with Florida Resident passes.  The price of parking alone is a rip off!  Why?  What are you paying for?  The honor to be able to park your car on Disney’s property, in order to pay them more money to get through their gate, and spend more money inside their park?!  It’s just a “hidden” extra cost of admission!  It’s a shame.    We’re Floridians… we put up with all the tourists and the traffic… many of us work in the hospitality industry, and are the ones who serve the tourist… but, we can’t afford to take our families to the Disney parks.
Dam, that is a RIP off
I'm sure 1:06 he is pinching pennies 1:20
Can always go to a six flags. 125 bucks 1 year pass with free parking every visit and actual real rides.
Grew up just outside of Clearwater and will never go to Disney again. Sucks life right out of people.
Honestly not bad for a family of 5 and only one being under 10.
Its gotten a little bet better!? Its worse than ever.
if its expensive, just dont go
I live in the U.K been to Disney 15 times just got quotes of 2 weeks staying in Disney French quarters £8,500 disneys quick service dining and tickets but still need other money to spend as well so it would cost at least £11,500 all in
Went to Disney France, many years back. We bought all the official Disney products before we went from charity shops. Must have spent around £30 pounds on 6 princes dresses and 20 plus Disney toys. Lots of big mini and micky plush toys etc. The prices they want to charge is outrageous for Chinese crap. My girls loved it and none the wiser we had not spent £100s on the stuff.
So the daughter liked the most to stand in line and talk to her family. That should show us something that the most important thing for kids is to spend time with them and not where.
I was never an amusement park person. Even as a young child, couldn't stand waiting in long lines for a ride that last at most 2 minutes. I would beg my family to go early before it got too crowded, but they always waited till it was high noon and the sun was blazing hot. No thanks.
We stayed for a week. Cost 10000 grand for 2 adults and a child. Went during covid, no lines.
“My favorite Disney movie is Pretty Woman. You know, the one where Cinderella charges by the hour.”
We were planning to go Disney at Spring break , but we looked at the prices and ended up going to Kennedy Space center. The whole trip including tickets, parking fee, our hotel in Melbourne, Fl for 3 nights together was cheaper than just the  tickets to Disney, not counting the hotel or anything. The theme parks in Orlando are getting way out hand for pricing.
Standing in lines in the 90 degree heat and humidity will drive kids crazy.
Dang right to comments Dang take 30 years to save to I will be 70 my 100 birthday present to my self finally have something to do no health insurance can not go to my citizen program no health insurance or food stamps the memories are forever no money time you shared all my family have been I like Trump casino but they lost inAC citizens program can’t go play bingo because no health insurance now have plans to go to Disney all by myself like I do have no homes attendance because I have no health insurance I forgot to say thank you for sharing beautiful family Happy  Father Day every day to you love from 313
Well after knowing what happened to the boy who inspired Peter Pan as well as the other fruits of that tree, we will never even want to go. Sick.
The dad is really cute. Does this include a hotel stay?
Boycott disney
I am completely uninterested in being around all the silly stuff and it is way too peopley there. (Too many people.)
A family is five is quite expensive to entertain - when a nice dinner is going to cost $250.   A camping trip is a good alternative for large families.
Disney is so overrated. I liked it back in the 70s.
The cost isn't a secret and a trip to Disneyland isn't a requirement for a good childhood.   If you don't want to spend the money don't go.
It’s simple supply and demand they have no shortage of people willing to pay if it was cheaper the park would be so full you couldn’t do anything.😂😂😂😂
I grew up in a family of 5 with 2 younger sisters… in Colorado.. when we would go to California to visit we always wanted to go but my dad would say.. the tickets alone are $500+.. and we had one special meal there.. that was more than 20 years ago..
I miss the Disneyland I remember as a kid and young adult. My parents could never have paid these prices.
And you are enabling it
Took my daughter to universal island of adventure during spring break. Tickets were $170 each and $30 for parking. We were done with everything we wanted to do by 3pm. By far the worse theme park I've been to
The place is magical .....makes your money disappear...😊😊😊😊
Wow the memories are forever will be 70 I want to go before I turn 100 I will save for 30 years worked 30 years for the Government and I have no food stamps or health insurance
DO NOT GO!!!!!
Our trip from Kansas to Disneyland in 2015 cost us over $5000.00. Granted we likely spent at least $750.00 of that on Obama Fuel Prices which were close to $5 per gallon at that time in the West and over $5 in California. Our tickets to the park cost over $500.00 back then for the 5 of us and I thought that was highway robbery. I was appalled to learn about 'FastPass' when I was there which was basically a service that allowed some who bought season tickets or some other travel or tourist packages or whatever that basically gave them the ability to CUT IN LINE on rides. That was total BS to me because that had never been a thing in the past. Also, Splash Mountain was down for 2 hours. We had to wait almost that long to finally get on that ride that day. I went to the offices, I guess it was 'Disney Government Building' or whatever it's called to complain about that and they gave our entire family 'fast-passes' to 3 rides. Whatever. We did get something out of that trip as far as 'fun' but it was way too crowded and not worth the money. I don't see how they get away with it. I guess people will just pay and accept that... There's not any value to it, even back then.
Pitiful and well, they are building a new Disney in Dubai so excited! not.
Just don’t go.
He was t forced to go he wanted to so to complain now is crazy
Never been there, never will. So much nicer to vacation away from crowds.
My buddy went to Disney years ago and said the same thing. That so many people bought the lighting pass, that line was actually longer not shorter.   And that people were fighting for bus space to go to the on site hotel meals. I was so intrigued, that I went online to verify his claims. The very first story/post I saw was "Seven Days on Jack and Waffle Cones. A Single Father's Story of Survival." I knew then that he was not  making it all up.
I grew up with my parents promising me that we would go to Disney World/Land someday for years, but now these days i see that will never happen
Quit beint poor pops 1400 for a family of 5 is less than 300 per person, it's Disney.
For that money you could fly your family to Europe
And she had to say "this was under the former administrtion, it has gotten a little bit better" Poor woman !
Keep it! I will not go back!
When my daughter was a kid she always wanted to go to Disneyland but I could never afford it!! 😪 (sniff)
3:22 you can see dads heart melt
Disney is like Vegas, in that every encounter, every step has been monetized. And the crowds make it as untenable as reserving a lifeboat on the Titanic.  But the one value you get is teaching your child that some things are an abomination, not an adventure.
I would rather go to super Nintendo world,  Disney sxcks lol
A fox video worth watching
You shouldn’t have to save for years to take your kids to Disney World
What a waste of money
Why cover the name of your YouTube channel with your head?
I would not have even gone to Disney, what a waste of money.
This is what you get when you have billionaires in charge.  Relates directly to our president as well.... In the cost for paying at the grocery store
It's been this way for years! Boycott Disney to bring prices down. They're not that great for $1,400. Idiots keep paying, though.
I miss the 80's/90's when Disneyland was just something that a family could do every few years. Now, it's like a once in a decade if you're lucky. It makes me appreciate the local small town carnivals more now, though.
Why support Disney? Why take your children to Disney… they are pro pride narcissistic psychopaths and covert pervert lovers of children.
That’s not worth $1000! It’s turned into a once in a lifetime thing especially for the average working class.
They should change the name to Greed World😢
So, you saved money on airfare or you'd be belly aching about that, too, people can't even afford rent!  Asking the girl if it was worth his money? And, clearly no one talks to her, just at her, or that'd not be her answer 🙄  Keep your kids off tv and why are you outing her for not wanting to be embarrassed about wearing a headband?
Dang thats what I paid for 4 people for 5 days 4 nights on 4th of July week about 18 years ago. That included hotel off site, Disneyland, and California theme park, eating, and extra collectable.
Maybe its a big scam now. Might as well get some potato sacks and have a dance.🎉
Did it get better?
Most families can’t afford a day at the beach. in New Jersey.  You have to pay for parking & to get onto the beach.
I thought that was typical, I was always told it's very pricey and hello!! 5 guest, plus feeding all...sounds about right
Disney is not family friendly
Oh well you voted for mango Mussolini so stop complaining!
I have to fly there and it cost me $1,400. So What we spending per person $2,800
The cost is why my children have never been to Disney. You can travel abroad for about the same cost.
Years ago, I was a single mother of two children who begged me to go to Disney.  Even then, the tickets and other prices for going were way beyond my means.  We ended up going to Holiday World in Indiana and had a wonderful time for a lot less money.
Had a lot of fun with her family waiting on the line 😂
Why would you go there? You got what you deserve.
I haven't been to Disney in almost 50 years and don't plan on ever going again.
Another reason more Americans are moving overseas for entertainment.
This is freaking absurd. Sorry, this is what happens when you go to Disney you should’ve looked at the prices before you left and let me guess it’s on Fox so it must be Biden’s fault right?
People couldn't afford groceries under the last administration and now it's better?? Is this really a news channel???
Disney is crazy, no way I will.ever go again.
AAA Has Disney Discounts
Walt Disney is turning in his grave watching how these Greedy executives have turned his family friendly business into their cash cow,, even going as far as stopping the famous Walt phrases like “Hello Boys and Girls “ it’s no longer allowed to say anything with boys and girls because they now cater to the gays, tranny’s and homosexuals that find it offensive. Sad and sickening.
What parking is not included with the park ticket? or am i missing something
We are very weong thinking it is a magical place and the other park where you can have time. The time you go to a local regional park and you realize you can ride 30 rides in one day and have tons of fun everything changesa
As long as the pixie dusters keeps forking over more money to get less, corporate disney will KEEP doing the price gouging all the way to the bank!
Some of the prices they showed aren't that bad. $44 for lunch for 5 people is actually cheaper than I would have guessed. Ice cream for 5 people being $25-$30 is pretty standard.
Should have waited and gone to Epic Universe!
waste of money - this is why Americans are broke - wasting money on crap like this
Corporate Greed at its best, Disney. When Bob Iger can get a $10 million dollar Christmas bonus yet Disney does not give any employees a Christmas bonus is so shameful. Disney has so many employees living in poverty, some living in cars, yet have no concerns about them.. but turn around and charge you $6 for a bottle of water which costs 25 cents is very sad. The government should get involved and stand up for the consumers, there needs to be a cap on the 4-500% price markups, especially when there making billions in profits and pay no taxes.
At those prices, they are taking the Mickey !
Disney is a waste of time and money.
This past Easter I took my daughter on our first mommy/daughter trip.  We live out of state so not only do we have to pay for hotel, park tickets, lightning lane tickets as well as extra passes for 7 Dwarfs Mine Train and Tron, which are not included in the lightning lane tickets, we also have to pay for airfare.  To eat the mediocre foods at the park restaurants along with souvenirs was so so expensive.  We've been taking her to Disney every year since she was 5 yo, but after this trip I told her this would be our last trip to Disney World.
Disneyland is not a necessity. If it's too expensive, don't go.
Dont go to disney  theybdont care about you  its a complete ripoff!!!!!!!!!!
This is the guy from  flying wheels
0:35 luke at that disney princess
We went there last April from CA and I was so shocked with our over all expenses that actually equates almost to our Europe trip last yr of 6N 7D Rome-Florence-Switzerland-Paris tour. Our EU expenses covered flights, train rides, hotels, food while Disney + Universal only for theme hopper park tickets, uber, hotels, food.  Its my first and probably wont be coming back 😂
Keep paying.    They not only keep charging your paying gives them ok to raise price as usual.    Quit paying  Quit.    Your kids will live
You should have asked him what the Minnie ears cost? $34.99   Isn’t that friggin ridiculous? I bought 3 for my kids. The same Mickey and Minnie ears can be bought on line for  less than $5  and there all made in China.
Flying wheels That guys got money
Divide his bill in 5 - he had it very cheap. A trip to Disneyland for205$ per person? Practically free.
car salesman
But there were five people. Why is he surprised? Just wanted to be on tv
Why not take the bus?  Also, how many parks did they have access to for the day?  Should be snacks & fast food on site, then eating at a restaurant off property.
America Voted for This Administration to inflate everything. So, Welcome to America?. Lol. This is my opinion.
One day is most expense! Florida resident could have AP for $469.  The lack of planning cost him lots of money. All parks in Florida costs.
They need to charge that much to get the money back from their box office flops like Snow White.
This will end up like 6 flags. Old crusty looking place with nothing but rude loud people walking around making life miserable.
that is how business is booming, charge high and keep profit high, make investors happy, forget the paying public's situation,,,
It’s the same at Disneyland in California. The park is ridiculously overcrowded and the wait times are unbearable. That alone makes it not worth the price anymore.
You too poor too go then.
How can you put a price on a family day no one will forget?
If her favorite thing was being able to talk to her family while waiting in line, they could’ve done that for free by going to the DMV or the grocery store lmaoooo. Sounds like she just wants to be able to talk to her parents. She doesn’t need the extra stuff
For a child 1 day 1 park tickets is over 200.00
Supporting Disney is disgusting. Shame on anyone and everyone doing so. Come on people, please WAKE UP!!
People should pull their heads out and totally refuse to go there for one whole season they are open and watch Disney panic and drop the prices. But yeah some people are just too STUPID to do that.
The theme parks had cost us about $1,000 a day in 2017 for 3 kids and two adults.  That was outside of peak season.  We don’t live in the US so Imagine factoring in plane tickets and hotels into that.  We had a good time but it is pretty expensive.
Dad complains about business expenses for his YouTube channel. Hard day at work with the fam at Disney over there.
Waste of money
None of this is a surprise though…you can look up the prices….why is this news?
Waaaaahhhhhh!!!! I cant afford a disney trip thats been expensive for three decades so im going to cry about it on TV while millions of Americans face actual problems. Yall are the definition of ❄️s.
They're a bunch of crooks at Disney. No amusement park isn't worth that amount of money.
Go to Six Flags instead, save hundreds and still have a great time.
I refuse to support them because they've gone woke.
They trying to make up for the losses on their woke films… Snow White!
This is all Bob Iger…he’s a soulless piece of crap who is over paid. Walt’s gonna roast him in the afterlife😆
Why would you go when you know it’s overpriced? Then cry about it 😂
If you dont like it...then dont go
Disneys overpriced and overrated
I remember 5 bucks in California 😮 we would go sometimes 3 times a month
The kid- said/. I like being in the line cause she gets to talk to her parents-   😂😂😂. There you parents !!!   😂😂😂.  Mic drop boom
I remember Disneyland (Anaheim) over 50 years ago. Parking and admission was a few dollars, the 'E' ticket (most costly) was 85¢, 'A' ticket was a quarter. A family could spend almost $100 in one day (with meals, not the hotel).
I’m shocked that he’s shocked.  What rock have you been under?
I think Disney World and Universal Orlando are only catered for the super rich of wealthiest people and families
So true.
Probably save 400$ if used cash❤
When I have kids in the future, I promise I will give them most of my time.
Unbelievable. Boycott this scam
Disney will keep raising prices until traffic stops growing.    What exactly is shocking about this?  It's called capitalism.  Fox and especially your conservative viewers should be loving this capitalist company make their money.  How else can they make more minimum wage jobs?  Stop complaining.
Y i k e s 😱
And all along the kids just wanted your time not an expensive trip to DIsney
With tariff going on, this $$$ fuel corporate greed.  Sad how Disney used to be fun for kids but now it come down to this 😢
All that money for 1 day in a super extremely packed park waiting in line in that heat is a rip off for 1 day! I would imagine 3 days plus hotel plus food for 3 days more! The weather changing unexpectedly its getting HOTTER every year and population increasing its going to be a disaster at those parks!
Oh honey, Honey. I have lived in Florida for 20 years, and i have only gone once. You chose this stop complaining.  You're not RELAVENT .  IT'S NOT THE HAPPYEST PLACE ON EARTH.
Why do they keep going?
It would've been cheaper to fly to Japan for a few days and go to Disneyland.
I haven’t been able to afford a vacation in years yet the IRS tells me every year that I make to much money when I can berly afford the things that I need
I could never take my child to Disney Paris because of costs living in Germany. To this day I retret it, cause its the real thing. We went to Europa Park instead, which was wonderful coasting 20 years ago for both of us sonething like 100 euro plus food and merch. But those parks know this that you want to have your kids those experiences and that you only come once or twice. Its sad for children who cant go. I am since then not a promoter of disney. Movies are crap nowadays and I would never pay for disney tv cause nothing to learn for children. Just boycott them and prices sort themselves out. Same with iphones btw.

Adventureland in des Moines or silver dollar city in Branson.  You could have season passes at silver dollar city for that price and go everyday. Ride 30 rides or times
Boycott
Disney is an absolute joke
Disney hates poor people
There are a lot of parents who can't even afford to take their children to a disney movie.
I save one day every few years to spend the entire day at dland as a local in Cali. My total is usually around at least $400 to treat myself.
Disneyland is not for people pinching pennies especially while your there, we saved a whole year for my daughter's 16th birthday, it was well worth it the whole experience and more plus the parade loved it loved it loved it❤
Can't afford rent and food but can afford that at disney
Woah 02:20 Fox passive propaganda in action
You can’t put a price a memories but Disney find out you can!
All that money for a theme park based on a RAT 🐀🐀
Although Disney land can be expensive, you have hard core fans who are will to pay the price!!
Well what a stupid Dad instead of going to somewhere better and not sp expensive to Disneyland he choose to go there with his family to a real amusement park he just went and complained about it what a Loser and idiot for real 😂😂😂😂😂
Bob Iger’s leadership has driven Disney into a perilous decline, squandering its American roots for a reckless global chase that’s left the company teetering on the edge of failure. While billions are dumped into ventures like Shanghai Disney Resort, domestic parks—once the heart of Disney’s magic—languish with exorbitant prices, crumbling guest experiences, and zero innovation, alienating the loyal U.S. audience that made Disney an icon. Disney+ flounders with pitiful subscriber growth at home, yet Iger keeps pouring resources overseas, a blunder reminiscent of General Motors and Kodak—corporate titans that chased foreign dreams, neglected their core, and collapsed into obscurity. His shortsighted gamble threatens to torch Disney’s cultural legacy and financial might, exposing a CEO more obsessed with global bragging rights than preserving what actually works.
Never again. Packed, people cutting in line to beat you to take pics with the princess 😂 never again
Yes, Disney was always expensive. However, in the 90's- 2000's, you could ride all of the rides you wanted (without buying any special ride pass to guarantee it), so  the ticket price was worth the cost.  There were rides we even rode twice if the line was short enough.
I live in Japan and going to Tokyo Disney is much cheaper and can take the subway there.  Much nicer than all the other Disneys.
Who remembers the day when you all you needed was a Coke can and school ID and it cost $20. Also you were not packed like sardines down Main Street like nowadays.
I went in December of 2023. Family of five and my teenage brought his girlfriend. The park was like $200/person and three of the six of us used ZERO rides. The other three of us had time for maybe 3 rides each!   Absolutely disgusting.   The worst part was seeing a ton of elderly people with a small child in tow….obviously it was grand ma and grand pa with the grand kid. Those groups paid $200/ticket as well and the grandparents were absolutely NOT going on any rides.    Such a scam! Total rip off. I don’t think I will ever go back to Disney. And I certainly will not recommend it.
Walt would be pissed.
Wow . That's a car payment for me..  Sheesh 😒
God Almighty, fox. "The last administration?" WHY??? Why do you have to do this. It is so wrong and any half bright human can see blatantly see that. Good Lord.
as my mom would say "we got the disney channel at home" that aint worth it.
I live 15 mins from Disney World… can’t afford it.
This is reason why we skipped going to Disney when we passed by LA.  tickets was $800 for 4 pax for 1 day. Waiting in long queues the whole is really not worth it. I rather go to Tokyo Disneyland it only cost me $80
Look at all those clueless spoiled kids lmao.
Boycott Disneyland and Disney World
Disney don't care because they are big and they have money.
Trying to make up for Snow White...lol
I went a few years ago. The ticket was expensive too but the parking was not. We ate outside the park the food has always been expensive. If you include getting to the park it can be an issue
Never Disney 😮
Supply and demand. It doesnt help everyone is putting their trip on credit cards. If the day was half that cost, then they would be complaining about the lines being too long, which they said they were. So pick and choose one.  Super super super overcrowded. Im talking Dehli, India crowded. You can smell the BO crowded..... or longish lines and paying out your wallet. Anything thats a family of 5+ is going to be expensive. Dont even try taking the kids to a ski resort
At Disneyland Anaheim they have a tier system for tickets.  I took my family over SPRING BREAK and paid premium prices.  If you decide to go OFF SEASON, or during the week (playing hookie) you'll pay less.
Not bad for 1400$ to go on 5 rides
The price for a good grooming is getting costly at disney. Someone has to pay for disney's woke failures.
Well stupid azzes keep paying for it.  Soooooo….
If you can't afford it, dont go
Well its a Red State so stop complaining idiots.
Me and my wife went to can cun 4 nights spent 1200.00 hotel, flights tickets to water parks meals drinks and cat rental
Disney World is the Monaco of Florida for the working man.
The freaking dude with the cuttlefish or whatever that was. Hr had some kind of mascot, a goldfish in a bowl I think, completely fictional that was like cgi or a marionette doll. He'd do videos about aliens or secret trap door mansions and he'd also do the voice for the fish with some whiny obnoxious accent. When that whole spiel failed, he started spending his dad's money buying and selling expensive cars and one of his first purchases which he had to sell at phenomenal loss was a cybertruck.  So dude that tries to sell us on how fabulous it is to _want_ exotic cars, also tries to sell us on the fact that he is everyday average dad dude, the professional "influencer."
Disneyland is the 😀happiest place on Earth ... for Disney executives, shareholders and investors🤑.  If you look at their financial statements, you'd learn their parks make up more than half of Disney's income.  As a result, it's the most stressful place on Earth for parents.😨😰😭😱🥵
I'm 43 and was brought to Disney World in FL 2x as a kid and went to Disneyland as a young adult.  I loved it.  I now have 2 kids.. With how Disney has been run as a company and with their costs I will NEVER go back.. The company could only have failed 1 way / and they found a way to do it acting all woke and liberal and being too expensive.  Disney is dead to me.. Haven't seen a movie since Frozen...
Don't get caught in the mouse trap 😂 I did
Good, great....  keep paying betas...bwahahahaha
The world is so big to just limit yourself to “this small world”. Explore Europe instead and learn some real history.
Poor baby 😢 IT,$ a small world after all. Unbelievable that Disney will do such a thing! Suck it up your daughter had fun, part of life mini dad.
People cannot afford groceries and gasoline prices ...... that was under the last administration ..... it has gotten a little bit better.  What a f%$# is she talking about ?
Disney needs to give me a stimulus check after going to Disneyland since 1967
DUMMY Fox News.   He’s a YOUTUBER.   He created this content.   He knew exactly what he was doing.
I'm a dad I'm shocked everytime I go to the grocery store. Things are skyrocketing in price.
Personally I think lower prices for local residents should be federally outlawed. If you want tourism, consider that the people coming in and propping up for entire business have already spent a boatload just getting in town. Why would they the. Be expected to pay a premium? They have dedicated more to doing business with you than local residents.
you have to go on a weekday when everyone's at work
Not worth it Boycott Disney
And in Paris it’s even more expensive. The costs have risen about 35 % the last 3 years.
Cost of living is now better??? Lmao
I remember growing up as a family we would rent a camper in the summer and go to different places each year. The best year I remember was going to Lake George in upstate New York. We had a ball that year, there were so many things to do. We ate out some nights in a restaurant but, we mostly cooked over a campfire 🔥. I was to young to worry about cost of things but, I’m sure that it was way cheaper than going to Disney.
Disney is so expensive so they can pay their employees basic wages 😢
Yeah. No, thank you 😂
They have to pay for all those flop movies somehow.
Disney will be going the way of Vegas.
Did you know that Disney will be opening a Disneyland in the Middle East.
While everyone can agree Disney is expensive, this is clearly just a story because Disney is the political opposition of modern Conservatives.
I wouldn't give you $50 for all of it.
The happiest place on earth, right?!!!!!!!
Overpriced!!! They should be investigated 😢
People are right.  Disney is now corporate GREED.  All Disney wants is cash and they are ripping off all of us.  Sick.  Walt would be ashamed.
We went around this time last year thinking we’d miss all the spring breaks…WRONG!!! I will NEVER go in the Spring again!!!! It was horribly packed and I didn’t know for like 2 months it’s National Cheerleading/Dance competitions hosted in Disney & Universal areas. So that means all of them and their families come and go to the parks. Plus it was so dang hot!!! We normally go in the Fall and winter. Prices in the Spring & Summer are horrendous so we get the multi day ticket package with 6 days being the best deal. Really all parks are expensive… Knotts, Six Flags, Universal, etc. It’s sad that parks really aren’t family friendly for budgets but neither are movie theaters, many restaurants, bowling alleys, fairs, ….It’s NOT just Disney folks!!!!
What do u expect though?
Disney is woke and ripped off
My state has largest Mall in America,and there are tons of cheap to expensive hotels to choose from,tons of rail to go anywhere,from museums to many ballparks,winter is ever better,all around the country is wonderful places,cheaper than Disney.
Stop going and paying their high prices.
Send in Elon!!!!Doge
2:24 BETTER??!!!!!  Lady you’re delusional.
Stop going. You already know it’s over priced, has been for a long time. I went to Disney world in the 90s and it was expensive back then. Went to Disneyland in 2010 and swore I’d never go again, of all the money I spent there it was actually a slice of pizza that broke me. Check out the menu for alien pizza planet in Disneyland, it wasn’t even that good.
F*&k Disney
Good ole Fox news not forgetting to pin the blame on the last administration...
I, for the life of me ,can not understand people who buy something , only to complain later .LISTEN. Buyer beware . Get it ? Got it ? Good .
He's still mad
Plus it’s liberal!
Low attendance still doesn't effect those lines.
I spend very little in the U.S. I book a flight to a very different country and stay a month and actually save money.
Six Flags season pass is like, $60 or something.
Give your child $5.00 a week and then tell them treat the family of five at Disney World. In 5 years, your child can pay for that 1day.
It’s called don’t go. It’s very nice of you to show us your hard earned work money disappear before your eyes and to be nice enough to show the world but, people should already know this. If you want to send a message then it’s pretty simple. Don’t go
Under the last administration?
Boycott Disney...
I’m Shocked how expensive everything still is. Inflation is never going away so get used to it!
The last time I went was in 2000 and it didn't cost that much. The food has always been expensive, but just to get in is ridiculous 😢😳😬😭🤯
“FLYING WHEELS”
I think when I went in 1990, it cost $100 for a pass to all three parks, and a little less for a little kid. I don't remember getting many souvenirs and did not stay on the property.
Huh? Trmps golden shoes are over $400 bucks lol
Why go and complain? Make a MAGA park so that way Disney will be free for those who enjoy it.
And yet, fathers will STILL fork out the bucks. Educate your children on what Disney WAS, back in the 60’s, compared to what Disney is NOW.
You can see prices all posted online..... It can't be a shock if you're PLANNING a trip ahead of time. Plan better, bring a cooler, your own food..there are ways to save money...go off season when prices are cheaper.   Disney is a perk..not necessity.
Sheesh! I’m glad that I have aged out of ever visiting Disneyland again!
Makes $5k on just one video and can't buy his kid a $44.00 light saber 😂. Do some research people.
If no one goes the price will go down
I wonder how the foreign Disney parks compare in pricing terms.
that's 100% robbery
Is he Ron's brother?  He looks just like him.
I agree with the video but maybe not around the kids let them enjoy.
Disney don't care about children or people enjoying themselves anymore just the greed part.
I’ve never been to Disney and don’t have any plans. The thought of long lines is repellent!
Not going there now glad I did when I was young 😂
You act like you didn’t know how much it was gonna cost. This isn’t anything new… Disney has been a scam for years
All ran by the LGBTQ Freaks!
I finally took my 5 and 7 year old girls there. They TOLD ME it was such a waste of time and money.
Remember all those people DEMANDING Disney employees need it to get paid more BINGO!!!
used to cost $25 per day
Thanks to Trump tariffs, everything will go up
This lady, no it hasn't gotten a little better.
Only $1400? Thats a bargain. Imagine family flying from out of state and having to rent hotels
Regardless of how ridiculous the prices are it's not going to stop people from going
That is outrageous!
The not so happiest place on Earth... 😞
As long as there’s idiots with money, Disney will stay in business !! 🙄
Why people continue to go to that hell hole is beyond me. A day in Disney is a day wasted in hell. DON'T GO!
She said that the economy has gotten a little bit better under this administration. That’s the propaganda. No way the economy is better now but, if you work for a network, you have to read the script.
Awesome, if you read the fine print on your Disney ticket, it is highly suggested you sell your organs to be able to afford the sky high prices at Disney.  From the company that takes ticket prices to infinity and beyond to subsidize sports no one watches and streaming shows no one watches.
Disgusting . I remember a couple of years ago the new CEO flat out said he did not want people without much knew there
Prices are not getting better they are getting worse.
My son, grandson and his wife, 3 great-grandchildren and me went camping for 4 days and 3 nights.  Van fuel $120. Food for 5 days $125. Misc(fishing bait, propane, bug spray, etc)$50. BLM fee Free. 4 tents, 7 sleeping bags, 3 dog beds😏 , came out of attic and garages at home. Played ball, swam in lake, ate fresh fish, took hikes, watched deer wander through camp site and raccoons trying to steal food😄. Twice a year, late spring and early Fall we take off. Desney? No way for our family. We know how to have a good and cheap time with lots of laughter and love!
The man has 437k subs on YouTube and is promoting it here. He can easily afford the trip.
OUTRAGEOUS!!! We took our son in 1995, stayed at the All Star Sports Resort for four days, saw the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Blizzard Beach, River Country, had snacks, drinks, meals, tips and souvenirs all for about $1,600!! Now, it cost nearly that for one day!!!
I paid $1,600 dollars for two people to stay at the Wilderness Lodge with Unlimited Hopper Pass for 6 nights, 7 days back in 1996. We spent about $65 dollars a day per person for Disney dining for all three meals. To drop $1,300 in one day is outrageous and Sinful ! Stop supporting the Disney Corporation ! Stop giving them you hard earned precious money !
*He should complain to President Trump. Tell him to make America Affordable again.*  💯🇺🇸
what? 1400 for a family of 5 is not that bad at all and im not a rich guy.
30 bucks for parking is insane.
I like how the host found a way to dig at the previous administration in a story not requiring mention of the previous administration. Smdh
Yep, I live in Florida with a Disney time share, $5000 per week for 4 is getting off cheap
i am overweight big nose short ugh lee  Women avoid me 😢  But the bright side i didnt waste the time headache money to stand in line at disney  $1400 😂  Every cloud has a silver lining 😊
We live 30 miles from "The Tragic Kingdom", we haven't been there in 28 years. The last time we checked, it would cost close to $2,300.. just to get us all inside, ridiculous!!!!
Native Floridians HATE Disney and attribute the downfall of Florida to this liberal company.
first world problems dont matter that much
He's an YouTuber
1 single potato Fry cost $5. Congrats you played yourself. Sorry but Disney are scammers
😂😂 Disneyland is soooo useless.. Disney adults are the prime target now not family
LAS VEGAS RESORT FEES 😡
A buddy of mine got us passes a couple of summers ago at Disneyland for five of us. He worked for Disney. I was very grateful. Hadn't been in about 15 years. Usually took the kids to Knott's in southern Ca as it was cheaper and the lines were better.
RW:when the “Magic” gets overdone by Greed
Geez, maybe this dad could have done research on...oh, that computer in his pocket before going.  It's no GIANT SURPRISE to ANYONE that Disney costs a fortune especially for a whole family.  And yes, it's HOT HERE 90+ today and not getting any cooler until maybe November.  This is such a NON-STORY put on by FOX to bash Disney yet again.  If this dad didn't have extra cash to toss into the garbage he could have found somewhere else to go where his family could be together.  That's what kids want.  That's the most important part of life.
GREEDY RIP-OFF 😮
But look how packed Disney is every day with so many people,  so money is not a problem, obviously 🙄 🤔
To "experience" what these "influencers" do.... EXPECT TO SHED LOTS LOTS LOTS OF $$$$
Don't really have sympathy for anyone vacationing at Disney. The company's politics has ruined Walt's legacy. Until there is a fundamental change in Disney leadership, I have no interest in giving them my money.
And that's what you'll spend if you do zero research or planning... Anywhere.  Especially Disney. Wait till those Trump tariffs hit. What an out of touch father. All complaints & surprised his daughter actually enjoyed the visit.
Even Florida residents can't even afford to go to Disney anymore!
Great Wolf Lodge it is
RW:this is just sad 😔
"Flying wheels" complaining about prices, he's not even a real poor
They should be called Dissssnuts
AND FOR SURE HE VOTE FOR *"TRUMP"* 😅😅
Disney just needs to limit visitors per day so that everyone can enjoy their special visit.
A family can no longer afford to go to amusement parks of any kind. It’s unbelievable what they charge. I went with my parents, years ago (1970’s) , it was mostly affordable at that time .
*The fact that visiting Disney is unaffordable for ordinary folks, and surviving on Disney paychecks is impossible for ordinary folks, all so little Bobbie Eegor's stock options can balloon in value, is very disturbing to me.*
Why drag the last administration into this? Own your support of this crazy administration, every facet of the cost of living will sky rocket.. Good Luck!
Spontaneous day trip to Disney and he's complaining about the price? Shouldn't be allowed to talk about penny pinching... we are not the same 😂
And the workers are living in cars not paid a living wage
Disney needs to make back the money they lost with all of those movies that bombed. Gotta over charge people somewhere.
The high price screens out a lot of people  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
You couldn't pay me $1400.00 to go to a Disney park.
Did he not check pricing beforehand? What was he expecting 😂
I’m 36yrs old and have never once been to Disney World in my life. The sole reason is what is talked about in this video. My family never could afford to take me even back in the day as a kid and I haven’t been able to afford to go as a teen or adult. Living in New Hampshire, makes it harder as well to just go for a day too. Being a Dad now with a child of my own, maybe someday me and my son can experience going to Disney World for the first time together.
Absolutely  no reason for the prices there. They'd do better business if the went back to the prices  of the 80s  you could go then you cant now
rip off.
Pobre.
AIN'T NO WAY IN HELL I WOULD SPEND ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THAT TO GO TO DISNEY WORLD, was there with my parents when I was 18 in 1970 when they first opened up, not sure what my parents paid for the 4 of us back then!!!😮 But recently went to a local MOVIE THEATER to see a movie for the first time in about 5-6 years and was I SURPRISED how much it cost between the price of the movie, small popcorn and a medium drink for JUST ME it was $43 and some change!!! I was FLABBERGASTED, I asked the girl was she kidding, boy was that a SLAP IN THE FACE of REALITY!!!😱😳😢😮‍💨 I guess I won't be going to the movies anytime soon unless it's with a DATE!!!🤔🤨😒😨😞
Several years ago family wanted to go to Disneyland. My husband and I laid out trip on paper. For a week trip ito California a four hour drive hotel 2 day park passes food etc. or fly to Orlando cruise out of port Canavaral for a week to Caribbean. It was by far cheaper to fly and cruise. We kept each part of the vaca a surprise they loved every second of it and did not even care we did not do Disneyland.
Imagine how much money they make that's only one family 😡 the hell going to Disney everyone should stop going
Close Disney down
I don’t get why people love these mediocre parks with hardly any good thrill rides. I’m wondering if Disney has to price people out so that the parks aren’t over crowded more than they already are.
😂😂😂 ur an idiot
This whole video is unhinged
Disney has never been cheap!
I grew up in SoCal.  71 now.  There is no way Disneyland is worth this outrageous expense.
I mean it’s Disney world in Florida compared to here in California lol that one in Florida is next to the ocean 😅compared to here in Anaheim where it gets hot and no ocean just traffic lol . But both of them regardless it’s like a vip trip for you’re basic your absurd prices
You don’t have to go
$1300? 😂 Suckers.
U can afford it, so stop complaining.
I NEVER watch Fox & Friends so when I saw a NON POLITICAL story I was like "Oh ok... give it a shot" I'm all into it and then BOOM!!! The partisan BS "under the last administration" as if people's lives have been changed under the Goof Troop. Can't do ONE F-ING STORY without dropping some manure in there somewhere. 🙄
zoomers have no self control and these people are the reason stuff costs so much
Got to feed the woke.
Choices, people, choices.
Umm then don’t go…. I’m confused, unless Mickey is forcing to go then find something to do for fun.
With all the Disney losses lately they need to make up for all the box office bombs they've put out.
Yup just went to Epcot last week came out to 750 for ticket of three and $30 for parking. That’s not counting a drink or snack. Disney has become for the rich
Donald Trump's fault
the one and only time I was at disney was in the early 70s, and to me the tourists' attractions are just a tourist trap, just to get your money, the last time I went on vacation was in 1981, with my mom and dad
I went to Disney Land in 1970 i know it didn't break the bank for Dad. Somewhere along the line somebody got greedy.
There is such a thing as price gouging laws. All amusement parks, airports and ball parks break these laws.
Boycott Disney.
Bro nobody forces you to go😂😂😂  You don't go to a highend restaurant and complain about the cost of the food. 😂😂😂   I understand is expensive but come on nobody forces anybody to spend money on expensive stuff😂😂
When you're trying to pinch pennies you don't go to Disney.  More than enjoying his day at Disney he wanted attention from social media and he got it.
Either give your daughter a nice Disney experience or skip it bro. Tacky
Sir you have the option of keeping your money in your pocket. Don't cry about it if you are willing to pay.
The best part for the kid was waiting in line. I've never been to Disney World except to apply for a job many years ago, but when I find myself waiting in a long line, I say to the person ahead of me or behind me, "Isn't it great that we get to wait in line?"  Some people don't think it's great.
Better to put that cash into your Roth IRA and give the kids an inflatable pool in the backyard with a few pizzas.
DL is now for the foreign tourists and rich. Others need not apply. You get stuffed in costs then stuffed into the park. Used to have season passes every year for decade at least but, those days are gone. Spend that kind of money to get in THEN (oh yeah) drop more$$$$$$ if you dont want to wait in line for an hour or more AND no way can you ride all the rides you want because lines are so long. Happiest place on Earth?????used to be
We make a very comfortable living. We were planning a trip to Disney World, but once we saw the cost, we decided on just doing Legoland only. We had a GREAT time!!
You complaining about how something is to expensive and over priced but you willingly paid for it anyway. It's time to be a grown-up and control your spending. If something is to expensive don't feed the demand. It's called self control and having a budget. 😮
Why are people still doing this crap?
who cares.  People got money (even when they are "struggling").   That's why prices everywhere gonna keep going up
I can afford Disney, i choose not to. Id rather take my family to Europe, someplace educational n fun
I hate Disney greedy period!
Equivalent to Asia tour
I grew up in SoCal, and was fortunate enough to have annual trips to Disneyland.  Now?  The last time I went was on a lovely, rainy day, so not so crowded.  It was fun.  But the prices have gone up yet again, so no.  Never again.
We went in 1983 and it was $10 tickets
0:48 He was wearing the Minnie Ears LMAO RN 😂😂😂
I grew up with Disney. The price is out of control . I just took 6 different days with different grandchildren during a so cal Disneyland Anaheim sell. Let me tell you Disney is costing more and more and providing less and less! They’ve cut back on all live entertainment and rides are breaking daily!! Get rid of Bob Iyger!!!
Disney is no longer interested in the middle class family! They are ONLY interested in millionaires and out of country guests that stay for weeks and spend higher amounts. Walt Disney’s original vision died with him.
He obviously doesn't wear the pants in his family.
Kids are expensive!
No.
Irrelevant! Parks are PACKED! People pay up to $10k to avoid lines. That’s how rich middle class simply have become
That’s amazing, what a wise little girl, she saw the most important element of their family adventure, the day trip and long lines really is worth doing because it brings the family closer together forcing them to slow down and talk with each other and have this experience that creates these shared memories - I also agree with the father that it is way too costly
I've not been to Disneyland since the late 70s. I hadn't had the desire to go back as it wasn't a fun experience for me. I had better fun at EpiCot and the other places my family went to  during the summer of '78. Over these past few years I've heard about how ridiculous the cost of going there was outrageously high just for one day of fun. Explore nature more in your state with your family it's a lot more budget friendly.
And still packed. Smh
Just spend 2 days at Disneyland and Cal Adventure a few weeks ago.  Family of 4, tickets total $1600, plus food around $200 total per day.  So total around $2000 for 2 days.  Stayed in Hyatt Regency about a mile away from Disney main gate and uber cost $10 one way.
He's complaining and still wearing the ears trust me brother as a Disneyland visitor I already know the burden it does feel overpriced but we should already know that times r tough but we should enjoy life to the fullest potential and enjoy every minute of it complaining doesn't fix it
You can live life without Disney😂😂😂
Disney had to make back the money they paid for Fox. Blame Comcast 😂
Thats why I aint going. In 2023 we went for a week to Disney World. It cost $1700 for just the tickets. I had lost of money then. Now I don't have enough to even live on.
I think the high prices is to keep crowds down and waiting times down🤷‍♀️
Don't go to Disneyland/ Disney World.   I went to Disneyland for the first time in 1972 (I was 12 years old).   Admission with a book of tickets was $12.   (Back then, each ride had a number, A, B, C, D, E.   "E" Rides were the best.  Everything has become unaffordable  😢😢😢
He should be thankful he went and those idiots in mini skirts weren't there.
Complete rip off
id pay double that, disney is class.
The employees are not paid a living wage. Many if them also receive public assistance. 😐 There was a whole documentary on this topic that was shocking!
Simple fix.  Spend your money elsewhere.  Disney hates you.
your not supposed to be able to afford it......  this is 1980's Michael Eisner's Disney with the unobtainable carrot in front of the serving class to keep them working harder for something out of reach.... Walt would probably be ashamed how the parks are captained these days.
I’ve been so many times as a kid living here. I don’t understand the hype honestly.
Everyone stop going to disneyland problem solve
Keep it up going to those places it’s going to get worse Dum a#%##{{(###(
Did a 5-day visit to Disney last summer with family of 4. Stayed on property, visited 4 parks over 3-days, and had the meal plan that covered all food needs for entire trip.  All-in about $5200. Wonderful experience. Paid ahead of time, didn’t even take my wallet into the parks.
I went in the summer of 1979 after graduating HS. I don’t remember what it cost?
See....the long lines are an added value so they came out way ahead.
As a Polish friend would say in his Eastern European accent-'vhat a vaste of money'.
Never been and don’t want to with prices like that. I would never spend $1400 on “rides” for 1 day ! Ridiculous waste of money.
if its not within your budget, dont go, or keep saving, but do not ruin the experience to the underage! Sure will be an unforgetable experience ,but for the wrong reasons..! Just saying!!
Disney is a Zionist entity, as are all of those corporations, including the financial sector, the largest food corporations, the merger of fertilizer companies and supermarkets, and new managements and owners of apartment buildings and trailer parks. They have infiltrated every sector and have control over it. These corporations are making your daily life very difficult. Their greed is insatiable. I've been collecting data and have been studying these findings, and these are facts, not claims. I'm not done yet with my analysis and not in a real rush to finish it. But I have enough data to present it to anyone who doesn't believe it..
I'm not sure what to express. Should we be surprised at what Disney is demanding from visitors due to their financial decisions? Or should we feel sad for both the families and the company? Neither! Families made it clear Disney is NOT family friendly like it was before. And Disney is trying hard to stay afloat because of their past, terrible decisions in DEI, lgbt7!&÷ pro environment & parades, and their push for inappropriate scenes in movies or movies in general! Walt was probably far more patriot and more family friendly than what today's corporate a$$holes are making it out to be.
The cost of making memories...  Worth it!
Cry
Fox just had to throw nonsense politics into an otherwise relatable story
Wow That's outrageous!! Who can afford that ???
Ohhh that little girl gave the most beautiful answer to “What did you enjoy most at Disney”?  She answers…. Being in line with my family and spending time together…🥰🥰 Right there is a beautiful and kind Adult in the making 🙏🙏✨✨ She is an absolute credit to her Dad and family
Let me guess.  There is a gofundme already set up.
Disney's dead
Look at what the young girl said, she enjoyed staying in the line talking to her family instead of the rides.. This has many realization..
No matter where you go on vacation, you have to be financially savvy, you have to look for little ways to cut costs. The tickets are very expensive, that is not a cost you can really cut, but you don't have to stay at onsite resorts, there are many condos, homes and hotels around Disney outside of the park that is much much cheaper than staying at Disney resorts. Also, just buy small snacks there, don't have meals at those restaurants, again, there are many many restaurants along International Drive. Also, if you don't want to pay extra for fast passes, choose the rides that you absolutely must do so that your wait is worth it, and go from there. Disney is definitely not affordable for most families anymore though, and that is sad.
Grew up near Disneyland and would spend days there in the summer with friends.  We brought our own lunches and ate on the grass watching everything going on.  Rode all of the rides many times over with just babysitting money I made.  Even had money left for a big ice cream.  But Disney isn't about families anymore.
lol! Faux news stirring the 💩 pot! 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
This thumbnail looks like an Onion joke.  Fox has truly jumped the shark😂
I Love the daughter's reply at the end. It costs a lot to keep that place running. It's investing in new imagination. inventors  or Creators..we can always use. I have always stood in long lines. The daughter is worth every penny. Lower the Cost 🙏💞🤗
Simple . If you don’t got the money to go don’t go then . Go to six flags or SeaWorld.
All of you complaining are poor. Living pay check to pay check and on EBT.😂
The only way my family and I was able to afford Disney is when we bought the 99.00 3 day military park hopper tickets back in the early 2000. I just saw now that those same tickets cost 295. I don’t know if the tickets now still allows you to enter the park a hour before it open to the general public. Secondly, you never eat in the park unless you want to spend  a fortune. Moreover, you should tried to go during their off seasons if you want to avoid the crowds. The park will close earlier but you don’t mind it as you probably rode the rides countless times and is ready to go.
Fantasy lands cost big money.
That is ridiculous!!
if yall 😂 poor just say that! 🧏🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
I bought a car from that guy!!!
Corporations are just terrible,  even Vegas is obscenely expensive. Just go camping.
Disney is magical… and welcoming to EVERYONE🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈. No doubt faux news is trying to throw it under the bus. Sure it’s expensive, but what did you expect!? Puff piece. Go away!
I remember when parking was free. California property. Then it went .to 25 cents. Last time I actually went was 1986. Parents paid. My son was 3 at the time. Haven’t been back since then. It’s just not worth it to me. The cost. The crowds.  Don’t miss it. No nostalgic feeling. We live a mere 11 miles away. I’d rather go to the beach. Walk around and swim. And only spend about what I’d pay to just park at amusement place.
Long lines. Forget it.
Stupid an dumb investment
Waste of money 💰
Wow.  ...they could have done something else for half the money...pinching pennies ??   Yea right ..😮😮😮
Disney is like Nintendo. They like to jack up the price because they can. They know you will do anything for your kids. 😂
Disney needs to consider what its supposed to mean for families - $1400 for a day? Thats crazy.....I feel for the father (having had 2 kids myself).
Overrated, overpriced... Not worth it at all.
family of 5 plus 2 grandparents and 2 meals for under $40, around $250 in today's money.
I was last there in 1992 with one child, and vowed to never return again.  I don't remember the pricing structure, but whatever it was it was enough to get my attention, and in 1992 I didn't need to pay as much attention to spending as I do now.  What Disney needs is a one month or one season punishment session to reset their little corporate greed problem they've developed.  As long as people keep paying these prices, they'll keep bending us over.  The same applies to fast food.   I've noped out on about 99% of it now.  Occasionally, Arby's will actually run some specials at non-insane prices in my area, and I'll take the bait.  But in general, they can all pound sand, especially McDonalds and BK, the two most expensive of all.
Disney? What’s that? Literally doesn’t exist to me.
This was to get his 15 minutes of social media fame, which he obviously was successful at.  He has a family of five, and chose to eat at Disney Springs where all the restaurants are pricey. He also could've gotten discount tickets ahead of time, especially being a Florida resident, with a package deal. And, yes, he went at one of the most crowded times, so he's bitching about lightning lane passes to avoid waiting in long lines. Wonder if he'll take a trip to Epic Universe to throw them under the bus too.
First world problem.
I heard in one day just to enter is 1000 for a family no thanks I'll dance around m Cinderella with mop n hand
Silver Dollar City is slowly going the same route!
I can confirm. These places are expensive.
This is Disneys way to recover the millions lost with their latest Snow White debacle.
The Murdoch Family is playing the hell out y'all. 😂
When they opened in 1971 a one day adult ticket was $3.50 so even at adult prices their family of 5 could have been in for $17.50 . A little less than 11 hours working at Federal Minimum Wage .\excluding taxes . So with today's minimum wage times 11 hours those 5 tickets Today should cost $79.75 NOT $974 .  Let THAT sink in
Too expensive... It shouldn't be like this. Even tourists doesn't wanna go there anymore
I boycott anything Disney 🙅‍♂️ Not giving them a penny. 🚫❌
Disney is disgusting.
You could take your kids on a Caribbean all inclusive cruise that would cost less than that for a week.
“Trying to pinch pennies”…yet CHOOSING to go to Disneyland and to pay their prices. Obviously have money to burn.
you mean he didnt know the cost of trip before he went poor planning
My family did Storyland in North Conway New Hampshire. It was  a far better experience than Disneyworld.
You could travel to another country for two weeks with that money
Disney is actually pretty cheap. The ticket price is not more expensive than a luxury restaurant now, so pathetic
I took my daughter and her mother for five days years ago during Covid. It was a magical experience and I would have paid double for those memories.
My neighbors got a $10k tax refund. The whole thing was blown on a week long Disneyworld vacation. Makes me sick. People are idiots.
Basically, you have to be financially well off to visit an amusement park. That’s ridiculous!
Just buy disney+, forget all the rest and tell them kids they have thousands of options so this is pointless.
Such a B.S. story. I guarantee you that half the people here are spending that much on alcohol by themselves. If he's complaining about the cost, then he did ZERO research. Taking a trip somewhere else will probably cost the same amount.
Disney has to finance its woke movie flops somehow. If you keep making garbage, they will not come.
Just go to Universal Epic Universe.  Eff Disney.
I'm so glad I went back in the 70s.  It reminded me of the 1964 World's Fair.  I waited in ONE line back then to ride Space Mountain.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Satanic place
Is that just for a day?!?! That price should be what you pay when you spend a week in the park! Dang!!! It has become so ridiculous!!!
Walt was no fool! Robbery 101
Welcome to 2025
Simple supply in demand. They have a expectation of a certain amount of customers each day. If they go over that, the park will be too packed. They simply keep raising the price to keep the park occupancy at a certain level. If people would stop going, the price would fall to get it back to the same level.
Disney needs to charge that much so they can pay their CEO ungodly amounts of money. $41 million dollars plus bonuses PER YEAR!!! Thanks a lot, Bob Iger
A vehicle channel goes viral for nothing pertaining to cars.USA😂
A broke white man crying because he can’t afford the price. Work harder and stop complaining. Isn’t that what yall tell us? Lmao
Even being a Florida resident doesn't get you perks. The prices keep going up because foreign money goes a long way when converting to our dollar. Its cheaper for them to visit, and stay longer, and spend more than us. I did all the Orlando parks, as ive lived here 40 years. Once is enough. Its a shame these parks have become so greedy.
We u can bring ur own food or u can eat outside the park I mean that what my friend mom did went we was little and the toy get at go at the outlet mall  just say I’m not trying to be mean
I have a gate ticket from 1979 , the price was $7
He’s trying to pinch pennie’s yet taking the family to Disney? Any adult wearing Minnie Mouse ears can’t be taken seriously. Ever
I hate Disney. And what drives me crazy is, they treat their employees like dirt and pay them peanuts. Disney employees in Orlando were told they had to come in to work during Hurricane Milton or potentially lose their jobs. The park stayed open for tourists and that is sick to me! The college program is a joke - literally they go around and use the old bait and switch trying to get college students to work for them and when they do, they pay them literally nothing and then on top of that they charge the students rent. By the time you get paid you are almost paying Disney to work for them during the college program. Just an awful company that doesn't care about people and I will never go there. I think more people hate Disney than it is talked about. One reason the prices remain high is because the films they make keep tanking and they haven't had a successful movie since Frozen in 2013. So, they have to make up that money some place. Just think of that day trip as your way of helping to pay off the flop known as Snow White that recently came out. Way to keep the Disney legacy alive man!
Imagine paying almost 1400 dollars a day to support a woke agenda
This guy charged his brother-in-law to buy a car at the auction and it’s out here complaining
I feel like they need to increase the prices or find a way to get rid of people. The lines are way too long.
It's worth it. Every penny. When you're in a 90 minute line for space mountain, remember supply and demand. The demand is there.
Huh isn't this biden fault? MAGA told me so.
For a single guy like me I went to disneyland couple months back and I spent $900 just for me, and the ticket and parking alone was $400
Disney is WOKE.  No thanks,  I am a Christian Republican
I know where we wont go thanks!!!!!!
I remember going to Disney World at spring break in 1986. The cost to get in was twenty dollars. I thought that was outrageous back then.
Yep !!! ... not even the locals could go into Disney ; for a local is better to get a job at Disney and get the free tickets . but them the Magic is gone down the drain .  who wants to hangout at work on the days off !!!
Kendall's response was the sweetest thing❤ (take note mom's and dad's).
The sheep will pay anything for a trip to disney. Thats where they go to worship hollywood cartoon characters.
Fly your family to Disney in Tokyo instead , thats what I did , way cheaper and we got an awesome trip out if it , Disney in Paris was also a little cheaper honestly most countries are cheaper except for London and Prague, take your trips over seas
I went to DW back in 93...my five day ticket was $250.
Disney lost some much money in the movies. So they are punishing people visiting the Disney theme parks
In Trump's economy, everything is more expensive than it was under Biden.
Well they're not making money on their woke movies and shows, so charge the park fees.
Trumps mess.  They're eating the cats and dogs, omg the price of eggs.  If, you can't afford a vacation at Disney or the Super Bowl or anywhere else I really could care less.
I haven't been to Disney World since the early 80's and have no plans of ever going back❗🤦‍♂️
Disney doesn’t care as long as there’s idiots that are willing to pay that amount. I haven’t been to Disneyland in like 7 yrs. I’m not giving them one dime of my money because you’re nothing but a bunch of greedy assholes.
Craig from “flying wheels” YouTube channel 😂😂😂 he rich he can afford it
After watching l realized  Sir Scamalot is running Disney and the public is under Mickey mind control
A 1 night stay at great wolf lodge in niagara falls is around 800 cad. Plus food and whatever else.
He should definitely never take is family on a ski vacation.
UMMM You do know that Disney is a Union Operation, There are no minimum wage workers there at 8.75 per hour, more like 28 per hour. So At least you can take comfort in knowing that the fees are going to the workers. Sadly id like to say, this is instead of the CEOs and the shareholders, but actually it is in addition to the previous. Sadly, Maybe if YOU were a member of a Union, you would have higher income and be able to go there. and the 1300 wouldnt be such a shock if you are making 100k per year,
That's ridiculous
Last time I was there was 2016. Already was a rip off.
Don’t forget to add on how much the day snacks and the lightening passes or fast passes cost too. It’s more like over 2k.
Keeping up with jones isn’t cheap.
He spent in 1 day. What I spent for 7 days befor the pandemic staying at the all star “value” resort and 7 days at the parks.  Smh.  Now it’s close to 2k for 7 days in the park and at the “value” resorts
I would not go if it was free. Go camping or hiking see the real world. Not the woke world.
Why would they charge less, greed runs deep.
When you're willing to pay that much you shouldn't complain about it afterward. Disney is not something you can't live without. For me, the crowds alone are a deterrent, and waiting two or three hours to get on a ride is the definition of stupid.
Disney’s lost its magic. Just take your kids to Blue Springs State Park and rent some tubes. You’ll have way better family memories.
The worst part is they now have people in costumes bugging everyone constantly.
Disney = satan
OVERPRICED
Back in the day, you knew doing something special was worth the extra cost, but it’s no longer it. It’s better to go to a lake and fishing.
I live in metro Atlanta. I grew up going to Six Flags. I'd go there before Disney. And it's still expensive. I think there are so many things that are fun to do for a family than wasting money that you probably don't have to waste. Disney (even the shows and channels now) are so not worth the hype. It was a lot better when I was a kid in the sixties and seventies.
Theme parks in general are overrated. I'd rather go visit a new state or country.
F Disney.  Just say no
Last time I went it was $45 a person.
The family trip is the Father's financial burden, not the Mother's financial burden!
🤷🏻‍♀️It’s $60 and $89 tickets for the Summer. The sale ends after September so hurry up! I’d if you’re a Florida resident it’s $60 & for everyone else it’s $89 starting in June.
Your first mistake was going to Disney
Ok here’s the thing, Disney World theme parks are overpriced af lol! But the hotels are reasonable surprisingly, it’s not expensive to fly to Disney either, especially from Michigan. But the parks are outrageous. 175 for one day per person! That’s crazy, when the hotel only costs like 135 a night.. no way does a theme park cost more than the entire hotel LOL
Ridiculous prices
Nothing is worth it anymore. Everything is too expensive and not worth it.
Will never support Disney!!!
Americans truly are idiots!!😅🤣😂
As a Floridian, I just wanted everyone to know that this was ridiculous before inflation and before the battle with Desantis.  I took my 3.4, and 10 year old. The lines were long, fast passes didn’t help. After a couple of hours, my kids asked to go home😂.  What people don’t know is that the surrounding businesses benefit off the tourism and provide a better experience.  We had so much fun at the McDonald’s up the street because it had arcades, slides and the works.
I once spent half the time waiting in line for 5 minute rides.
Did he mention how much the hair band was?
Well but he has 5 kids!!! As a FL resident 4 day ticket price is $240 a person, don’t you know how much you going to spend upfront?
What is she talking about? Nothing has gotten better!!
I thought trump was bringing prices down.
"Most families can't do Disney" but somehow the darn parks are always packed!!!
We have been traveling around the world the last 20 months and our monthly expenditures are close to what he spent that one day. Scam.
I worked in Social Services for over 45 yrs of working those those in poverty. In groups of 20 during open discussions Adults would always say they wanted to work a job that would allow them to afford to take their children. As adults, they had never been there either.😢
you dont need to eat there. if you want it could of been a snack not a whole meal. i remember Disneyland use to have special price for ppl who lived in so Cal. parking use to be free then it was a small fee. when it went up so high. we couldnt even go anymore.
Why is this on the news? Epic paid for it
Lady !!! did you say prices are getting better under this administration compared to last administration???? Why ????
Go back to the old days when people enjoyed their families with nothing more than a transistor radio.
Bro felt like the gerbil eating meme lol
remember going to Disneyland years ago, and even then it was expensive for 1 day at $100 per person, think it was back in 1997 and it was off season (not summer).  Haven't been back since.
I was 8 or 9 the first time I went to Disneyland. It was Boy's Club day and a ticket book was $5. I had to do chores for 2 weeks to earn it.
Tariff Disney so that the imbalance between Americans and Disneyland will be balanced.
His video went viral so….
They could have spent half that in Gatlinburg and saw the great outdoors and the fun rides
Disney is a pdos
And I'm playing to take a 3 day hopper to Disneyland this summer. 3 days at Disney, hotel and food
Absurd! Stop buying into it!!
Disneyland or world is for the rich only now
But prices are DOWN!!!! I heard Donald Trump say it.
If you think this looks good. You cringe.
There are people who give $40k/year to Disney to belong in their travel club. I haven't given Disney a dime since 1979.
People keep paying it.  And they will keep increasing the prices as long as they do.       Disney is STUPID expensive.
they need to raise prices its to crowded at disney land
Shame on Disney
(a fake story based on a true story) .... many decades ago, i'd go the baseball stadium ... there was two basic places to buy hot dogs ...inside the stadium or outside the stadium ... the hot dogs OUTSIDE the stadium cost $1 ... the hot dogs INSIDE the stadium cost $2 .... i learned the FAST way - eat before you buy a ticket !!
Disney is way over priced. I won't go there.
The price, and you only get to ride maybe five or six rides. I went to Disneyland in March on a "slower" day. We bought lightning, and still, it was too crowded to walk.
Went to Disneyworld in March 2024, 3 people for 6 days to hit all of the parks plus meals came out to about $6000 plus flights.
Do the math before you go next time. Save you a lot of money. There’s literally nothing of value at Disney lol what an idiot
Then don t go. It s stress free withe that method.
I have never in my life gone to Disney
Dad wanted likes for his post and saw dollar signs in his eyes to go 'viral' and to make a bag for his post NOT to be with his kids. He looks like a man without a razor or a job whose kids don't get love to the point where HIS DAUGHTER IS HAPPY TO WAIT IN A LINE WITH HER WORTHLESS DAD.
I will stick with my Dodge Omni.
Disney isn't what it was when we were kids when it first opened in the early-70s, even through the late 80s/early 90s. Now, the company is abject garbage. It was nice what the kid said, but stay home and talk to your family for free.
Try busch gardens its probably cheaper and better ride's.
It’s worth it to her because sheeee DIDN’T PAY!
It’s crazy. Hell nooo
If u live close to Disney might hv to just get a seasonal job or hv ur child get one so u can get in for free
Disney Parks are the only part of their empire actually earning a profit so they are slowly increasing prices and fleecing their customers for every penny they can get.
I am 38 and I have never been to disney land or expensive theme parks, too expensive. I rather travel.
😂😂😂😂
He just realized 😂 …. It’s been like this for ever 🙄
My grandfather is rolling in his grave.
FL residents should get 30% off all Disney fees. Take care of ur own.
What you want to do.... And what you should do... DEFINES... ADULTHOOD. Sometimes the best lesson for your children is to say know we cannot do this but we can find a better vacation for a lot less. .  A MISSED OPPORTUNITY TO TEACH YOUR CHILDREN NOT TO BE CONNED... AND WHEN TO WALK AWAY ‼️
You paid it so shut up!
and they didn't get many rides for that money, i bet.
There are so many other children's parks that are cheaper and better than Disney . Without all that hype children will enjoy any place they can have fun . The best is not always better , esp. when it's expensive .
😡👎
stop it. no one is forcing you to go.  okay maybe ur kids, so just shut up ok
Never been there and never will 🖕😁🖕
Better take your kids for a nature journeys than PDFile Disney
Why pay to go into a giant merch mall??
F*** Disney Too expensive and too woke. I will never go again. My last time was in 2012.
How stupid she said things were more expensive under the last administration. Things are Much more expensive now!!
Yup! We stopped going to Disney due to the cost as well.
Omg! That precious lil girl just made her Dads Day!”Best part was standing in line. Got to talk to my family and don’t usually get to do that!” Perfect answer. ❤🙏🏼👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💃
what 's gross is people pay these prices and it never trickles down to the talented staff
Still worth it you get what you pay for go to Disney
He looked sick
All that money and that girl wouldn’t wear those ears???
My father had a kaneption fit in 1968 at Disney Land to buy a twelve or thirteen dollar ticket passes.
That actually doesn't sound so bad for a family of 5.
rich people think this is normal... the bitcs at bop house think this is normal because white knights send them money
I love the dad. He's keeping it real and showing us already how pathetically overpriced a trip to Disney is. And what is even staggering, he and his family are Florida residents. I thought Florida residents had a discount to go to the theme parks. At least he gave his daughter wonderful family memories, something that is getting harder to do for most American families
How was the cost a surprise to him? Every line item could have been researched ahead of time.
I went 2 years ago. Two people for a week. Airfare, hotel & park tickets ended up being over $4000. Luckily, i could enjoy just spending the day being immersed in scenery, so i don’t spend much, but one person could easily blow $500 a day on souvenirs and food.   It ends up being like a $10k week vacation. Haha
It's Disney!! Did ya know that The AMERICAN TAXPAYER'S SUBSIDIZED WALT DISNEY??!!
This father is a cretin. He obviously knew what he was getting into. He’s a jackass looking for views. Despicable.
Ever considered not going? Way to ruin your kids dream trip bitching about the price like we didn’t all know Disney was expensive. I bet he went on a Saturday too, expecting short lines
I wouldnt spend 1400 hundred on a week there.
2:15 Fox News being Fox News.
Universal is better
What was the cost of Disney 30 years ago?
No to anything disney…
I'll go to "six flags over georgia" 10 times before Disney! 😮
Disney has been overpriced for many decades. The only people who have ever gone to Disney want to waste money and time. Those who do not have enough sense to LOOK UP WHAT IS COSTS TO GO TO DISNEY ON THE INTERNET deserve what they get.
In May 1985 Disneyland  was for one day $29 for my 9 year old and $32 for me.
Lego land too it’s insane as a single mom of 3 I dream of bringing my 3 boys who went threw hell at a young age.  I dream of bringing them to Disney Lego land but the price is insane it’s not even going up o happen
Disney started pricing themselves out of the market in the 90s. They got greedy. When EPCOT 1st opened you could buy 1 ticket and go to both parks the same day if you wanted. THAT didn't last🤑
Went to their Animal Kingdom, and Epcot. Of course we went as adults to see what all the hype is about, and We just do not see the appeal.  Spent the next day of vacation at Cape Canaveral.  It was fantastic. $1400 is fine, if you feel you got what you wanted from the trip.
What a sweet little girl. I loved that her favourite part about the trip was spending time talking with her family in the line ups ❤️
Kids just want to be with you. Sitting watching the sunset on a beautiful lake sounds a whole lot better than standing in a hot line for an hour. We’re done with those people mover parks. Give me Mother Nature.
Why in your right mind would you want to squander your money  their..  its crass ,,corny ,peurile,downright pathetic place i wouldnt be caught dead going to..
He's a small business person. He knows about write offs. That's not the same impact as non-business owners.
Im sorry but the cost of a theme park trip is not a basic necessity. It an entertainment industry cost and if you cant afford to cover food or rent you’re not going to go to a theme park. Typical fox making a scene out of a non-issue and of course finding a way to blame Biden 😂
F that. Ridiculous
Going to Disney is expensive  Other breaking news: the ocean contains water
I’ve been emailing them saying its unrealistic and they would bring more people if the prices weren’t so so high
I’ve been emailing them saying its unrealistic and they would bring more people if the prices weren’t so so high
Disney world is very overrated.
in 1974-75  i use to take my girlfriend to disneyworld 4 hour drive , ticket book $7. each with many free ride. i haven't missed anything over the decades.
well he went so he is part of the problem.   Hipsters gotta be hip...no matter what the cost
Disney is overrated. Stop going there, it’s not worth it.
Not worth it whatsoever
He’s famous YouTuber
The problem with kids is they manipulate parents into taking them to Disney. Why? So you can make line for a ride that lasts 5 minutes? I'd go to Europe instead of Disney.
For the rich kids only
At least him and his family get to go on vacation! I sure can’t😢
We left Disney and started cruising. You really can't touch the value for the money. Clear as mud.
So it costs 1,400/Day. That is a shitload of money. But than the daughter replies to what did you like most with; I don't know. I think I liked waiting inline so I got to talk to everyone. And I'm thinking by myself; Maybe his kids just want their dad to take a day off, turn off the phone and stay home with them. I think the dad never caught on on that and could have achieved a lot more for a lot less.
That is GREED!!! NO way id pay that
it aint cheap
Stop paying those prices
Thanks for your sharing. I'm taking my family elsewhere
Want to know how to fix this??? Stop supporting places like that. Boycott them, and watch how quick they lower prices and still make millions
No shock they’re trying to buy WWE. Tix to a 3 hour wwe event for 5 is this much.  Life’s rough
Once my son grew out of the Cars craze, I stopped buying anything Disney. Their greed knows no bounds.
EVERYBODY KNOWS IT COSTS THIS MUCH!! *WHY DOES ANYONE GO THERE?* That is just stupid money for what you.....oh.........I see now.....stupid people....or gullible people...... I don't waste my money that way. I also don't run full speed into a wall. That would be a bad thing to do too.....and I know it. However, some people just don't.
And Bob Iger doesn't have an agenda? Ruined Disney. BOYCOTT ALL THINGS DISNEY !
There is no price when you are making Memories with family I know it hurts but suck it up or go somewhere else.
Based Dad raising one helluva honest and caring daughter.. Props to Craig..
Well thank to P.Trump, he doesn’t allow the tourists visiting America 🇺🇸 and my family want to visit Disneyland for first time. From Indonesia 🇮🇩
Not The Onion
Man, marry at your own risk.
Disney was good when I was a kid before Disney died. Now I wish Disney would go out of business for good.
Ummmm no
This is why only the uber rich can go here. That's why I've never gone here, even when I lived in florida!
A full day of live entertainment, plus eating out for 5 people.  Do you expect it to be cheap?  Welcome to the real world
And this man lives in Florida. Imagine how much it costs for out of state families to pay for travel, rooming, food, the tickets. He got to drive back home in Florida.
I will be 63 on the 17 of May and I have never been to Disney but I have always wanted to go.  I live in Philadelphia, PA so you known I will not get any discounts so the dream of going to Disney in Orlando with my wife is not going to happen because of the price is just to high. I would if I could afford the trip, it just to expenses for us to go and I believe that I speak for all middle class Americans.
I woke up after my last Disney trip. Disneyland is not Dad friendly especially one income  Dad friendly. For me to go it cost 6 tickets each day plus 6 meals. Come on Disney. Give us a break. I'd be more willing to go if they would just give me a free pass for paying for my family of 6
Anybody who would go there at those prices are a FOOL.
what a rip off !!!!!!
I would not support anything to do with them the movies they made are not for normal Christian family anymore , nothing but bad news...
Who tf still goes to disney?
No magic is worth that. Fly to Tokyo and visit Tokyo Disneyland. Overall will cost more, sure, but you get so much more, too!
All of America's great entertainment has been priced to profit off the rich. Major league sports are just as bad.
Happiness:  Have purchased Zero Disney product since 1975.  Rode in/on Space Mountain when it was pretty new. 😮  The company is a mess.
That’s why I prefer Universal Studios because it’s more affordable and I have NO KIDS!
don’t go then stop whining
I live here in Florida, and I stopped going to Disney years ago....way too high!
It's hard to fandom these prices considering  I grew up 15 minutes away from Disneyland in California when admission was free if you wanted to just walk around. Then depending on what you could afford or the rides you wanted to get on there was the ticket coupon books with ten rides for $4.75. .25 cents for the kiddy rides. I know I'm living in the past but seriously it should not cost $1,400
TWAT
The most disappointing thing I’ve ever done. I don’t understand the hype for this place.
My family and myself stopped going there years ago for all the reasons mentioned. Anyplace that lets people pay to cut the lines is a place I’m going to avoid lol!
It's 2025! What is so shocking in this pricing? It's not like he was going to spend a day at the state fair.
HEY WHY DOESNT SOMEONE ASK TRUMP TO TAKE THE TARIFF MONEY HE HAS COLLECTED AN START BUILDING FACTORIES HERE IN AMERICA TO MAKE THE THINGS WE WAS GETTING FROM OTHER COUNTRIES
I wouldn't go if Disney paid me...evil corporation.
Walt wanted it affordable theme park. It’s far from that now.
Dad looks like a JD Vance twin!!!!!   Could def be related!
Idiots still going - get a life
They splurged, don't be deceived. You can spend much less and have a great time but it still isn't worth it.
Better to go as a couple.  Let your kids go when they are adults.
Never again...was there 30 years ago with my younger children. My grand child now has to take her parents, not me...
Yuck! I would personally hate doing all that stuff with my kids or grandkids! I love going for a ride in the country, going swimming, having a campfire, fishing, things like that..... quieter, less people, more talking with family members, sleep easy, lots of good times!
Hard Pass!
boycott Disney's overpriced prices
You could have gotten a little boat for your kid to use
Seems like the money was well spent. I actually do like how social and relax the lines q’s are at Disney.
Remember, the "wall" that was supposed to "Make America Great Again"?🤔  I think Disney World's paywall has the same intent. 😂  MDWGA: Make Disney World Great Again. 💯👍
That’s why I no longer go.  The prices are insane.
@flyingwheels
Wow shocker disney expensive that so shocking  wow big news
Disney is for dumb people who just follow along. Not what I would call independent thinkers.
Exactly, People need to protest just like they protest for everything else and Disney will have no choice but to bring down their prices.
Di$ney must make up for the $now white debacle somehow.
It is expensive but it is worth it. Many people spends thousands a year in alcohol, expensive cars and even drugs. I think disney is cheap compared to that.  A day with my family in that atmosphere is priceless.
Under the last administration things were bad but now they've gotten better, is she serious? My goodness lady!!  There is no way I would spend $1400 on one day at Disney to just stand in lines. Me and my family will go to the free public beach with a pack of uno and phase ten cards, some subs from publix and have even more fun!!
Its going to get worse.. Those fire works come from China. All there merc is manufactured in China. No one outside the USA will go to Disney because of the borders harassment. Americans cant afford it because of Trumps tariffs
He could have gotten a 3 day pass and it would be cheaper.  What a complainer, how much did he get from that short video.  Saw a silver You Tube video, a business expense.  Boo you.. as always a jab at  Brandon. He was responsible for Disney go greedy .  They lost money on Trump bleach moment of COVID is going away and they trying to make that money .
What makes “this” Dad so special?
In the 80s it was hundreds of dollars for a family of 4. So that cost today is about right.
Thats my youtube car guy!!!
And they are local.  If you have to get lodging, additional meals, other necessities double or triple the cost
My family and friends have boycotted Disney, after they stuck their noses into Florida politics regarding our schools!
I love watching conservatives cry about basic economics.
Have never gone … that place is a huge hell no!
I had been to DisneyWorld  2 times back in 1976 and 1981. In 1976 prices were about $8.50 to enter then last time there in 1981 was $12.50 or $13.00 to enter for the day.I look up the inflation calculator that today price 2025 for Disney Admission for the day should be between $43.00 to $50.00 a day but now jeez $140.00 to some $180.00 a day there ,that is grossly over inflation price!
I had a friend who was a diehard employee at the Anaheim park Fantasmic show. We would laugh at the 35 bucks to get in back in 1995
We used to have annual passes and go often, not anymore! Too expensive and too woke for my taste! Disney is something of the past for our family!
I will not spend one cent anything Disney any more. I drove right by Disney World without slowing down.
Goodbye.  Collage
Whether you want to go to Disney or see the pyramids of Egypt, visit them on the internet. No lines. No waiting. And best of all is that it's absolutely free. 👍
It’s about $6,500 for a week vacation on the value resorts every included.
Keep it.
Why would he be in shock ,if he did his research he would had known ,apparently it wasn't that big of shock ,THEY STILL WENT😂
go to six flags instead
Overated .. over priced..
And the employees are probably still underpaid
Yet their employees are homeless?  Make it make sense
It is Trump's tariffs!
Ruin your vacation and run the news circuit for 5 minutes because you had to pony up. Stay home scrooge...you were probably riding in the left lane.
Why the heck is this news?  Dude didn't do the math ahead of time, now he's going viral.  You're not important or unique.  Disney is still packing them in.  I used to enjoy the place, but now I can't afford it.  That's life, move on.  Now any idiot can blow a ton of money on something and go viral??
So in other words you used credit cards cause you don’t have the actual money to pay for it, so you’re crying about the cost on your credit card? No one needed to watch you waste that much money when it’s not worth it to begin with. Jokes on you for even going to a dump. Oh but you’re on Fox News lol Fox fake news I mean. You people are clowns reporting lies to the people. Trumps ratings are the lowest out of all presidents in the past 80 years. He’s a failure and screwing your all over lol you’re scared of trump lol
Sad that this country was built by people in denim and overalls, that could have a pretty good life.  Now it’s almost all ruined by over educated, no common sense having people in suits.
Definitely expensive. Me my wife and 2 kids . I was paying for everything inside from food and drinks . Well near $1000 for one day
No way absolutely ridiculous 😊
Why is this news worthy? This is a known thing.
I thought all you conservatives bent over for oligarchs. Why are you complaining now that only they can afford a vacation 😂
It’s capitalism
It's funny how nobody can afford it but you have the park his pact
I take my kids to state and local parks.
Stop giving Disney your hard earned money! 🤦🏽
Last time I went to Disneyland in Ca it was $20.   I saw Janis Joplin in concert for $4.
The concept of disney pricing isnt that hard to understand...they want to keep ticket prices high so that only high income families will attend....if you keep ticket prices low, then low income families will attend....and which income families usually cause problems and fights at parks??? Think about it...
Comments below are people who make their lives complicated by their priorities of political beliefs. Priorities of these people are just plain laughable
Don’t go, whiner.
I spent about 2k at the park, 2 days for park hopper for DCA and Disneyland. Majority was food, tickets, lighting lane and then the lightsaber experience + other items. Yeah, it adds up and Disney is pricing it so locals can't go, the average family can't go and only those who can are the wealthy.
Yeah, that's just stupidity. I'm sorry. Don't complain if you're not there by force.
We have always had tons of fun when we go to Disney. I know going into this trip that it will cost me. We grew up not ever being able to go. I do understand what everyone means about it being costly.
I'm glad I went a thousand times before it got expensive 😅
If you put that $1400 in an IRA until she graduates college…
seems like only certain demographics can actually afford Disney🫢....🤔...is Disney racist?
That little girl's answer was really wonderful. What a good answer
Can you truly put a price on memories though? A child’s smile in the Happiest Place on Earth makes it worth it. Some folks won’t ever get it.
I am done and completely fed up with DEI Woke Disney. I am refraining all products made by Disney after 2012 to keep them away from my children and protect their sanity and innocence.
Well simple solution, don't have so many kids you have to bring!  ha ha, sorry couldn't resist.  Yeah I've been there many times with my parents when it was affordable, but now, I have less than zero interest in supporting that kingdom.  So many other amazing trips to go on with that money.
not news to me....I knew this 15 year ago, and said never going back. Since then anything created by Disney has been non grata...😝
With what they charge for everything, parking should be free.
Why is it, in this clip - "the happiest liberal place on earth" - I didn't see a single minority person? Disney has become trash - VERY EXPEN$IVE TRASH !!!
Light Saber.....MADE IN CHINA
No one has to deal with Disney. Ignore them and maybe they'll go away.
Why is this news… no Sh** the cost is high… it has been forever.
Reminds me of Whistler, even with just me, sometimes I spend easily over a grand a day.
No disrespect but I think folks need to consider having less kids. It’s going to get even more expensive to raise a family so why not just plan for a smaller one.
She said it all ....Standing in line with my family SOOOOO SWEET !
I was at the grocery store and complaining about the cost and the lady said at least you can afford to buy groceries. She told me to be grateful…The situation is not great but we can be grateful.  She just threw the “under the last administration” comment. Things are expensive right now.
But, I thought Trump is your economic savior Daddy. What happened?? If you want to live without it being expensive come live under my Agenda. It's waaaaay better than Trump, Joey boy, Obama umm I mean Osama, and Bushmonster...
Sad
Was going to Disney like 10 years ago and when we added everything up,the wife and i chose Hawaii as it would cost almost the same
First you pay an obscene of money to get in the door. Then you get the Disney Experience of long lines, sauna bath weather, line cutters, people fighting, exorbitant food costs and drunks.  Sounds magical to me.
Disney should be for people with money.  Just like a college education.  Lower income families should go to the beach - it's free.
Just ridiculous  !     Working class cant afford to go to pro sports events, disney, most restaurants,  cant afford a new car, hell cant afford to fix the car . the list is endless !!!!   This country is totally fu**ed
There ain't nothing about Disney world that's family oriented. It's all about making them  money. They don't care about you or your family.
Waste of money for some woke BS.
You gotta be f ing kiddin me! I will never go there again. That is disgusting.
😂 Broke Trump cultists who voted for a billionaire complaining about “corporate greed”. Cognitive dissonance is hilarious. 😆
Why? With the exception of the daughter saying she enjoyed being with her family, it was a great waste of money; admittedly so by the fact the father posted the video. They could have done any number of things to bring the family together that would have cost much less, and saved for the college education of the children.
I go there and don't spend nearly that.  You could go there specially as a florida resident and between the entrance, food and parking I pay less then $200 per person.  and if you buy their anual pass you could go for even cheaper.  I think it's all political BS,  is it for everyone? No, just like Universal, Six Flags and other places everyone visit, even the movies could be expensive for some one.  People don't have to like them for what ever reasons they have but exaggerating because your political views is just ridiculous.  Im sure the kids whom the parks are make for whom don't know any better,  would like to go there and have a magical day
You expect the best you expect Americans to make good money and at the same time you don't want to pay anything come on get over it stop crying about it do what you got to do and get your kids to Disneyland imagine how much it cost to park just to run everyday
Why do people keep going to Disneyland?  As long as the share holders see that people are paying those crazy prices the more they'll keep hiking them up.
Disneyland / world. No thanks.
This isn't news, and if you cant Google the ticket prices and menu prices ahead of time then you cant fix stupid.
Parking should be included with your ticket
You chose to go.  Why complain?  Just stop going.  If enough people stopped going, maybe prices will come down.
This is what gews  do.
With their woke agenda I would never take my kids to Disney world ever.
Wow. What a story. I’ve never heard this said before about Disney.
You go, you pay, you complain,  why go?? 😮
Gews hate you and your family. Quit contributing to them.
Disney’s current pricing model feels exploitative—systematically squeezing middle-class families until they’re financially stretched to the breaking point. Although we live just forty-five minutes away, I’ve consciously avoided the parks because of these predatory practices. Yet when my wife surprised our children with tickets, I reluctantly joined them—only to be hit with parking fees so exorbitant they must generate unimaginable daily revenue. Inside, the culinary offerings were equally disappointing. My son’s chili cheese dog, splashed across their advertisements, arrived with barely a fraction of the toppings shown—a blatant case of false advertising and a merciless rip-off that leaves parents out of pocket and kids disillusioned.  For those who travel from afar—factoring in airfare, rental cars, and hotel stays—the total expense quickly becomes astronomical. Disney now caters almost exclusively to the ultra-wealthy, stripping away the magic for everyone else. Long queues snake through every attraction, constantly interspersed with aggressive upsells for “faster” access. What should be a day of family fun instead feels like an unending barrage of fees and frustration. It’s frankly absurd.
So how about souviners
Boycott Disney. Not worth it.
So, don't go to Disney then.
Get a season pass...
Oof! I thought this man was Jeremy Renner - he looks just like the actor! Could probably make a decent side-gig as a look-alike.
The fact that she tried to point out that this administration is better than last is bullcrap!! Fox is still trying to lie with every story they cover! Trump administration has ruined America in the short time it's been in power!!!
Last summer my family (of 4 adults) were in Orlando and wanted to spend one day at the park.  It would have cost us $720.00 ($180.00 each) to just walk in the park.  No parking, fast passes, food or drinks…. Just to walk into the park.  Needless to say, we didn’t go and chances are, we will not be going anymore.
I'm sorry I haven't seen prices get any better here in Michigan
I love how the host tried to blame Biden but trump is president
Yeah.  It wasn't any fun last time we went.  That was 3 years ago.
Glad that I went to Disney World as a kid, teenager and the last time I was 20 years old.  It is not worth it anymore!  I rather go to State parks and city attractions like Vizcaya in Miami or the beach!  I will never go to Disney World again!
This guy buys and sells cars
It is definitely not worth the money.
They went woke and deserve to go broke
If you pay their prices you’re a foolish idiot!
A choice to pay the money. You chose -$1400.
Getting served by a woman with a beard costs extra!
I would rather spent a week in a supemax prison than go to Disney world.
Thanks Biden, thanks Obama, thanks Clinton!
The child is afraid to bad-mouth Disney World.
never understood why people go to these places. paying 1k to do what? walk around?
Never been to Disneyland or Disney World, never seen a Disney movie, never bought a scrap of Disney anything, and never intend to. Disney is for suckers.
$30 for parking? It’s more expensive here in California with DLR/DCA, where parking is $35!!!
Liked to go.... but when they went gender / trans / woke....no more
Mickey and Goofy should come to YOUR house for that kind of dough!
Oh my word….why?  Isn’t this place supposed to be a place for everyone to enjoy. You know Walt is shaking his head.
This dude should be ashamed. But there's no shame anymore. This dude makes way more than $1,400 a day on his YouTube channel of almost 500,000 subscribers plus his Instagram plus whatever else. The dude buys Lamborghinis and Ferraris left and right. He's incredibly rich from YouTube alone. I don't know what his background was he was probably already rich. This is sad. Embarrass your kids like that
Disney has lost the plot, in 1992 park pass 99$ for a year with Cal residents. I like the e tickets rides of 1970 that ment you could go on any ride you wanted. Disney has falling I am not going back.
This is not on Disney. This is on the parents who keep going there even though they can't afford it.
There is only one judge and one judge only , that would be Judy.  THE JUDGE JUDY FAN CLUB. The Happiest Place in the World.  I want my E tickets back.
I literally just bought a cheeseburger with no lettuce and a small milkshake with $25 so yeah  Craig from flying Wheels car dealer he's got money
That's what happens when you take your family to a Devil's playground.
How do you think they keep making movies like Snow White.
The cost of DEI doesn't come cheap.
You have to be "goofy" to pay that much just for one day!  That's crazy!
All Disney should go out of business and people should boycott it. I bet Walt Disney his dream theme park is no longer for families, all just a worthless for-profit big corporation rotten mess. All corporations suck.
Yet Disneyland pays absolute 💩 to the employees!  Make it make sense CORPORATE MERIKA! Bunch of BS.   Stop going.
You have to go to your 🏦 bank & get a loan to go do anything with your family or with 0 family nowadays thanks to the Bien administration!!!
Well when you keep making movies that flop you need to find a way to make up for it. 😂
That's cheap go to Disneyland in California......
Disney Land or Disney World have been rip-offs for years. Trips, outings, or vacations require planning and research, so the parties involved have a rough idea what the options are, and it’s related costs.  Once a decision is made, surprises should be minimal.
I'm 31 ...never been ...never will period
In a Vedal987 stream, they went to Disneyland. Balloon was $20 each. Mickey Mouse pen in the gift shop was $18.. Rip off.
🤨This is only $280 per person. Thats actually not bad at all. Ive gone to brunches and spent more. Try flying to Europe with a family of 5.
Hmm…. Boycott them b-tards.
Were they born yesterday? Why is this news
So a one day trip to Disney is expensive as heck. 3 days is worth it
The public is being fleeced and gouged at every turn, for everything.
It's always going to be your personal choice.   If you go have fun, yes sometimes there will be moods, but, because of ecosystem of the establishment, crowds, long waiting lines.     At the end, you will be surprised that you are creating happy moments with your family, just know your limits. The daughter of the dad loved the lines because they made so many conversations along the passing time, so lovely that she took that token of that time spent at Disney, like nothing even matter just to go there and spend time talking in the lines.
i'm thankful that both of my kids dislike disney.
He has youtube channel he can afford it but yup its expensive
BOYCOTT DISNEY....THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU.... THEY WOKE...THST IS PATHETIC...SHAME IN DISNEY...
Well yeah why the hell would a place that big with that many staff be cheap? There are smaller parks to a lot closer and a lot cheaper. You also don't have 5000k other people around you at all times and the kids don't care they had fun.
I used to love Disney but go so seldom now - during high season you can do so little in a day, during low season it's much more fun, but lately the prices are so high. The quality is still there in the park infrastructure, but the high-season crowds are awful.The Lightning Passes etc I find offensive because that's money that goes to Disney that's completely paid for by the vacation time and money of the guests who can't justify the cost of the pass.
Robbery!!!
trip to Disney 😲 with Family priceless💖
I stopped going to Disney with my kids for over 12 years when my kid couldn’t even ride majority of those ride due to height constraint and long lines. How can people afford Disney?
If Trump were president of the US, all Americans could afford a family Disney trip.
they did not enclude food and souvenirs in park
I wouldn’t spend five cents at Disneyland to take my family. They’re so woke and weird and I’ll spend my money elsewhere.
Disney needs to make up the losses from woke movie flops.
Dude must've been living under a rock  FDisney
Yeah, I get it—Disneyland can definitely drain your wallet. I remember taking my girlfriend and her sister back in 2006. It wasn’t cheap even then, but we had a great time and made the most of it. One moment I still remember: I bought one of those big caramel apples during a break—pretty pricey—and her sister took one bite, made a face, and just casually tossed it in the trash like it was nothing. She wasn’t a kid either—just no reaction, no “thanks” or “sorry,” just kept walking. I didn’t say anything, but I definitely felt it. Funny how those little moments stick with you.
Nope! Not doing it ! My kids don’t need to have anything to do with Disney
Somehow I don't think Walt would approve. As I recall, he built Disneyland to be a fun, and affordable, place for families.
I hate CNN and MSNBC for being ultra to the left but Fox News is just as bad but to the right. Well it was so expensive under the last administration It's gotten a little bit better? How? Everything's more expensive than it was 5 months ago. What is cheaper? I swear every reporter at Fox News has orange Cheeto dust on her lips... Because they can't stop sucking...
Nope, totally not worth it!
WOKE DISNEYWORLD  SUCKS!
And it's only gonna get more expensive with Trump in office... somehow, Agent Orange manages to inflate the inflation and multiply corporate greed...
Disney makes Vegas look cheap!
What is the obsession with the plastic mouse?
I would love to take my grandkids but those prices are ridiculous.
Really?  It’s freaking Disney and he didn’t think it would be expensive?
Am sure the kids will be traumatized if they dont go to disneyland. lol
Took my 4 kids a few years ago.  Insane cost.  Average person cannot afford it and for the ones that extend to go-feel bad for them.  Just not worth it.  What I paid I could have taken my kids almost anywhere.
He is in the fortunate class that is able to spend more than $1400 for family entertainment for one day. For many people, this is not even a possibility. Disney is only for the fortunate ones.
So dad is local, imagine what staying at the resort does for the total cost.
Good father,,,he spend over a grand,as soon they went got in,,,Walt Disney would be turning in his grave,, it’s a shame
3 days and nights with 1 day park hopper and rental car and hotel is 1200😂. Please don’t start being fake news fox
Disney 🗑
Go to orlando it might be comparatively cheaper
“during the last administration” says the trumpty propaganda clown
People, just don't go please... spend time with your kids in other ways
Chomo Central, don't take your kids to that he//hole!
Should have boycotted ITS NO LONGER WALT DISNEY I rt was taken over by the woke crowd and it’s ruined
I’ve never wanted to go to Disney World.  Went when I was little and was bored.  I prefer Six Flags and Universal Studios.
Bro a dos he could have signed up for the Costco package take shuttle like I said dad is a disabled person so no line 😂
No way I'd ever go to Disney!!! Over 1,000 for one day!! That's insane!!!
Absolutely ridiculous  cost. Just say no.
Just dont do Disney....It is a political company that does not care about your family.  It used to be fun, but not anymore and it is so much more expensive.  Just go to the mall, or hiking, or to a cheaper amusement park or the beach, lake or pretty much anything.
That’s not a lot……. Maybe get a decent job L dad
tarrifs on florida
Just don’t go.  Prices will come down.
"its gotten a little bit better"? what a moronic, slanted comment to make. NOTHING has "gotten better".
Disney is not cheap. You are paying for the branding involved. Look into smaller, more local, theme parks that operate in your home state and make it a day trip.
I would only go for the haunted mansion.
ohhh well suck it up..
Boycott Disney then they will drop their prices
Our family has written off Disney after all the woke crap. There are better holidays to spend money on with the family, and I don't want to support what Disney has become.
Who here is shocked that Disney is incredibly expensive
What a spoiled girl honestly. I feel bad for the dad. And her answer of what was her favorite part of Disney, “I liked waiting in the line because we got to talk” 💀 bruh that’s a slap in the face to the dad. I feel really bad for him now. She didn’t know what was her favorite part because she didn’t have any!!!! That’s why she looked lost when she got asked the question!!!! That’s sad!!! And don’t tell me “she’s a kid, she probably can’t think of an answer” nah bruh my 6 year old brother can answer quicker than her about anything he likes 😂
47 years ago my wife , myself and three children took a trip package from New Orleans to Disney for three days / Daytona Beach for four days including airfare, hotels and a rental car through American Express tours . Total cost for everything was $799.
Food prices there are also crazy.
Disney is a ripoff! It's so expensive! They're so greedy!
The crowds are one reason The influencers who walk around filming can get in the way Based on projections it's going to get more expensive
I could of put on a Mcy hat for $100 bucks for this mark.
The solution is don't go to Disney.
Narure is fun, free, and educational...i love camping and the beach.😊
I grew up with the Mouseketeers and dreams of Disneyland. I’m now 73 and I have never been and will never be able to go. But with the way Disney has changed, I’m not sure I really care.
I wonder if season passes would be worth it if you lived nearby. I live near a 6 flags and I got season passes. It was a lot of fun the first like 10 trips but now it's not so great unless I take somebody with me. I'm forever alone though. Haha.
I, too, was raised going to Disney.  It's been many, many years that I decided never again. Sorry, I can't afford to drive a BMW.  The cost is more than my mortgage.  Noway, I won't do it.
In 1991 it cost my parents $75 for a school trip to Disneyland, they didn't have lighting passes and all that stuff back then, you just patiently waited in line.
Being living in FL since 2010… I never went to Disney World…. It’s an overpaid scam.
No surprise; Disney is run by greedy liberals.
Awesome story! I live in Jacksonville, Florida. We go to Disney almost every year. We just went to Disney springs last weekend to watch Thunderbolts Disney theme parks are so fun but they are so expensive. They definitely force you to shop shop shop and God bless that little girl. I did not expect the answer she gave. You could tell tell her father is raising her very right
This is definitely NOT INFLATION! WDW just always wants more money! I would never take my child there. THEY ARE NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY!!! DON'T TAKE YOUR KIDS THERE IT'S DANGEROUS 😮
Well, this is a nice plug for HIS YouTube channel! Maybe trying to just recoup some of the Disney costs!🐭🐭
Is going to Wokeyland still a thing?? 😐😐
Don’t eat there if it’s too much carry some sandwich’s and some drinks an fruit in yo back pack ya be good
The CEO of Disney gets around $40 mil. per year, so to him $1400 is the same as a cup of coffee.
Now kids won’t get 30 dolls but just 2 dolls😂😂😂😂
All that money going towards grooming.
Why the hell is Craig from flying wheels on Fox?😂
that's why you should only go about once a decade lol
The child had one complaint. It was too crowded. The price is obviously not high enough. Look… luxury items are expensive. Expensive things are not for everyone. Disney is no different
Wow, now that light saber will cost $150, since we know that Disney will not absorb the tariff cost…
It’s not rocket surgery! You can see how much it costs BEFORE YOU EVEN GO! Of course everyone who’s not paying will have a good/great time. Great job telling everyone what most of the world easily knows. THANKS CAPTAIN OBVIOUS!
Lol and yet you still go lol
20 years ago I took my then fiance now wife to Disneyland California I don't remember the total cost but we had two regular sized hot dogs and two sodas for lunch off of a hot dog cart and it cost us 35.00 and a souvenir magnet what's $10 this is 20 years ago we only went for the day because we were not there for just Disney we only had time for two rides they did not have the fastpass back then that was our time at Disney😮
Only idiots go to Disneyland nowadays !
I don't know why people are complaining it's just like when you go to football games and baseball games people pay the prices that's why the athletes are paid more and more money nowadays.  For Disney people are still going so of course the price is going to go up The demand is there.  Quite simple.
I took my daughter to Disneyland California, we stayed at the Disneyland hotel just across the street from Disney ( my daughter is a teenager ) .  Firstly, when we got the hotel room, we went up to it and all there was was a queen size bed and the sofa in the room so we went down to the desk and said there must be a mistake. We booked two queen size beds that’s when they showed us the fine fine print Where it states they reserve the right to change your booking and because I booked an adult and a child they figured the child must be like eight years old and she can sleep in the hide a bed and the adult can sleep in the queen size while I can tell you that did not go over well, but they were booked so I had no choice. Then we find out that the hotels under renovations the restaurant isn’t open the bar at the pool isn’t open for any adults that want to enjoy a drink sitting in the hot tub when the evening arrives. I was also told by one of the employees confidentially, of course when I inquired why nothing had a price tag he told me they weren’t allowed to price things because the prices get increased so often they’re not supposed to tell people what they cost. They just scan it and surprise surprise that’s when you find out what it cost. I was there for nine days and it ended up costing me $11,000 my daughter when we arrive back home and we landed at the airport we are Canadians and she turned looked at me and said I’ve never been so happy to see a Canadian flag that pretty much sums  it up. Don’t take your kid to Disneyland.!
I'm a dad left in shock that people still go to Disney
I could care less
Easy solution don’t go anymore
Unforgettable trip in more ways than one😏
Walt Disney would be rolling over in his grave if he could see what it’s costing a family to go to his parks. Go watch the video when he opened Disneyland and he says it’s for everybody. It’s not for everybody anymore. It’s for the people who have big money. I just tried to price out going to the POP Century at our normal time in November and it was going to cost as close to $9000 which included the park hopper and the meal plan, when my kids were younger it only cost us $4000. It’s just a shame. It’s a shame I can only say it over and over again it’s a shame what they’re doing And then they’ll come back and rationalize why they do it but go see their profits every year on movies and the parks. What they’ll do next is complain that’s Snow White didn’t make enough move money in the theater and that’s why they had to raise the price. They need to be bring back the original fast pass that was on the app and not make you pay for it
Well,don't go there,I won't,this trips are for rich people..!
I wished I purchased the lifetime pass 20 yrs ago...
And it is going to get worse! So Get ready for the free ride guys!😂😂😂
There’s Universal along with other park brands. And once you leave park property you’ll save 30 to 80% on any souvenirs.
Complaining about the astronomical prices but he still paid them. They all complain but they keep coming, so I guess Disney hasn't reached the breaking point yet.
Why is everyone so mad.  Prices are set to what people will pay.
Doesn’t even include lunch snacks transportation or lodging!
Just go to a National Park way way cheaper and much more rewarding for the kids. And it’s free or political propaganda and woke ideas.
Woke costs money.
It's the Trump tariffs. Disney imports happiness from a factory in Guangdong, China. 😁
It's not too much $ if people keep paying🤔 vote with your wallet people.
We are trying to pinch pennies, but yet you go to Disney land. Yeah, im glad you spent that much wake up and take your family out for a weekend with much you spent
Trump should put a tariff on all visitors going 😂😂😂
Pathetic brainwashed people go the WDW. Terrible.
Disney isn’t for the average American family anymore.
Disney = 🤮🤮🤮
I go to the beach, grab a beer and slice of pizza and I am fine watching the sunset.
❤ Kendall
We were there on a toasty and humid June day, standing in line for 45 minutes for a minute and forty five seconds ride when even our young children decided Disneyworld was over-rated and they preferred to swim back at the hotel. Never again!
That is stupid expensive!!! Absolutely not!!!
Horrible what Disney is doing. No wonder their movies suck!
Come on now, it’s only $280 a head.
Wow. Y blaming Biden? This is under trump
Blame trump
Paying over $1K for a day of long lines, sweat and aggravation. I didn’t even go there when I lived three blocks from the front entrance.
They're suckers. You knew how much tickets and food cost, but still went. Stop whining. There are many families that can't afford to go. Your kids are happy. So shut up.
I will never go to Disney again in my life. Spend that much to wait in lines for hours
Worth every penny to go a few times in your lifetime . Yes it’s quite expensive, but then so are those nail salon trips twice a month , latest name brand shoes & pocketbooks, hairdos etc.. I do without those types of things to save for Disney vacation (or any vacation).. it’s all up to what your personal priorities are . I don’t need the latest iPhone every time a new one becomes available.. everyone likes what they like ! There are ways to trim the costs. We drive instead of flying , we stay just off property which saves a lot . Take advantage of free complimentary breakfast at our lodging.  Disney is a great family experience. I remember when it was only orange groves where Disney is located. Anyways I saw so many people bashing Disney but I’ll bet they have been a few times and enjoyed themselves. Same with Universal Studios, Sea World, Busch Gardens, Six Flags etc etc ..
Stop the stupidity America!
Really...this is NOT news...someone wants their 15 mins of fame...pinching pennies...give it a rest.
Asking the child who hasn't contributed a cent if it (the cost) was worth it. Wow, great reporting...
Spending $1400 for a fun, memorable moment with your kids is priceless.  You don't go to Disney every day.
Shouldnt cost more than 15$ per child maximum. 1400$ you can have a private kids party at home with mascots, magicians and music and food and so much more
If you are going to attend the park, why make you pay to park?  And $30.00 just to park the car?
So if you had to fly in, rent a car and get a hotel; Wow!
Disney has to make up the money for the losses on the Woke crap like the new Snow White.
Your better off going to a state fair at this point
disney LAnd in LA disney wORLd in Orlando
Never wanted to go there Never been there  and will Never go there.
I'm in shock any daddy would take their children to pedivile😂
I loved Disney from years ago. But now, no. Not since the first LGBTQ+ movie and series. Disney has changed for the worse than ever. And now the Greediest Place on Earth, just like kensylva116 said hours ago. I total agree with the person. Disney wants to be around longer for years to come. That's not going to happen. Not if take the companies back to them. I got a feeling they won't, until they will ruined our childhoods forever. And Lilo & Stitch remake will flop. Time and time again. They need to stop, until Disney will be broke. That's going to happen.
Disneyland in Anaheim has now allowed the gangs to bully the people who at one time would never have to worry about taking their family to Disneyland.  Ten years ago, that would never have been allowed.  The cameras would catch those gang bullies and stop it.  Now, the gang members, take their babies in strollers, wife and children and push ahead, knocking adults and children out of their way and if you say anything they show you their muscle.  Beware people, I believe they may be carrying knives or weapons of some sort.  The men have gang tattoos and they use terrible obscenities when they push you and your children out of their way.  Welcome to the WOKE Disneyland Anaheim park.  Very scary!!!!!  And you pay a small fortune for this experience.
I found the lightening passes saved alot of time. Time is money and when you want to get the most rides in for your money... I justified it that way. But still quite costly
She took a jab at the former administration and said with this current one it’s a little better… that’s 🧢… it’s not better what so ever!!!
I snowbird an hour's south of Disney World. I went there once for the day, and will never go back. It's a total rip-off.
Just went a month ago with 2 adults and a toddler, all in, flights, rental car, hotel, admissions for 3 days and all the other things you end up buying in the parks cost us $5000 and that’s with an under 2 yr old with free admission and employee hotel discount!!! Would probably $1000-2000 more without discounts
So…he’s complaining about a day trip for a family of five?! Why not go some place else?! This is rage baiting, a plug for his social media to get more views, his daughter enjoyed herself, what am I missing? So many other options to take your family with $1400 and have a great time. Why choose to pay the price and then complain about it afterwards?
Its NOT worth it.
Disney is not worth one penny!!! This family is lucky. Imagine a person that works at MacDonalds and makes a basic wage, they will never have anything like this. Disney should be ashamed of themselves. Greed for sure.
They have to pay for all that wokeness somehow. Their movies won't do it.
Not even worth it. You're essentially paying to mostly stand in lines all day. Stop patronizing them.
Back in the 70's it was to.much
Yet the park is still packed so it’s all about supply and demand.
Stop going out stop buying from crooks.
No sir I can’t relate .. we can hardly afford food I can’t even comprehend dropping this for a day trip
Went to Disneyland on my honeymoon in 1972.  Wasn't worth it even then.
Be careful about your complaining folks, Disney is a business designed to benefit their shareholders. The more people complain about the long lines for the rides, the more leeway you are giving Disney to further raise the admission prices to squeeze out the complainers.  If you're still feeling bad, consider that you're helping to support some old Florida retirees, as Disney makes a $40 annual economic impact on the state of Florida.
Disney needs to go away
*We lived in Florida and had 5 kids, and even though I was making good money 20 years ago when we went there, everything was so expensive that I said we would never go back ... and we didn't.* The prices continually go up way more than the cost of living.
I know people who have taken out loans to go to Disneyland. It was a great place until Covid hit and then the bigwigs at Disney wanted back all the money they loss during covid. They are nothing but greedy scumbags.
Never used to be like that back in the good old days.
Such a soft simp
Sweetest unexpected response.
Disney is part of a underground  dirt story.
1400 dollars, double that and then some and go to Japan, and go to disney sea. And go explore Japan on the side.
Whatever. Not surprised. Just don't go. They'll get the message
GO WOKE. GO BROKE!
My wife and I spent a week in Tennessee this past Xmas and didn’t spend $1,000 the whole week!
I wanted to take my son for his 3rd birthday so we started doing a package of hotel, 4 day park tickets, with the food package and memory maker. This is all towards the fall coming two almost 5,000 dollars since we are going before his 3rd birthday in reality the cost is just me and my husband. We decided we are not going. I'm not going to spend that kind of money.
Rich white people problems.
I went there in ‘79 and I never care to go again.
You need to spend at least $7000 which is about $550 a month on your CC payments for a year
Wait...he didn't know it's expensive?
Just hand over your wallet to the mouse!🤦‍♂️
What’s wrong did it take money away from you getting another stupid hat
Woke Disneyland! I will never go back.
Last I went to Disneyland in 2005, they had just added Fast Pass. They were free at the time.
A round at Donald Trumps International golf course is $600 per person. Mar-a-Lago is $200,000 membership fee and $14,000 a year plus $2000 a night to stay there. $$$$$$
Tariff costs!  Everything’s going up, $3.50 for a Snickers bar now.
Disney lost me years ago. They've been cancelled.
Scam
This is sad. We took our girls there a few years ago and I was utterly shocked by the price of everything. We have had so many other family vacations since then and have not spent even half of what we spent there. And we have traveled everywhere!! It’s sad really. It was definitely not a dream vacation. I would say visiting Mackinac Island in Michigan, or camping with my kids or so many great places in the Midwest have been so much better!
Daytona Beach is 50 miles east of Disney, the beach is natural beauty, and cheaper
Why complain LoL but good to know... Only the Rich 🤑🤑🤑
Nothing like getting robbed by a mouse.  It's the happiest place on Earth, so long as you keep paying us.
I wanna know what profession the dad is in to spend like that.
I wouldn't step foot in Disney, Ever!!! Even if it was 20 bucks!
Wow, what kind of mickey mouse operation is this joint?
Jabs last administration.  Fox paid dominion $787 million for being fake news
Never been, maybe never will!
Disney it appears has been fleeced by the culture of GREED. I seriously wonder how Walt Disney, the founder for the benefit of family and children feels about this looking down???
Got to pay to play.  There are people world wide that pay the price and never complain 😊
$50 hr to visit Disney bank 😮😮😮
I’m surprised Fox hasn’t blamed Biden for this yet?
Haven't been to Disney in years, a lot of years all due to the cost. Not going period.
If you think that's high, imagine what it would have cost to take his family to an NFL game or a major concert.
I thought prices are coming down. What's the price of a cup of coffee at Trump Tower?
Watch your kids in these “parks” js
Boycott Disney!!!They do not care about children!!!
And it's now only going to be worse....
😂 fox news viewers can't comprehend supply and demand. Even at this.price, there are so many ppl and hours long line. Disney need to increase the price more until lines are short.
i'm surprised he was surprised lol
Me and Jerome and bonquista spent the whole day for free just like vip!
Deeeep Answer and HINT from that daughter ❤🤔😊
Only $30 for parking?  Disneyland is at least $50.
Simple fix…don’t support of visit Disney….plenty of other destinations that are far less expensive.
Walt’s dream IS DEAD
Complain to the man u voted for 😅
Sorry, most average American are living paycheck to paycheck.  If some got half a brain, they won’t be spending about $1400 for a family of four waiting hours in long lines just for a few minutes per ride.
Who still likes Disney?
Disney is way too woke for me.  They won’t my money.
Disney is too WOKE!!!
I will never go there but I can understand why some people are still enjoying it. That is their money and they can spend it whatever they want for their pleasure. I will also buy something I want no matter how expensive it is.
no self respecting man would support that company
Check out the Disney Cruise price tag if you want a shocker.
don't go to Disney, it's overrated, not very much worth it. you're insane if people fall for it
In 1981, a one-day pass was $10.
CORPORATE GREED
And it’s only going to get worse under this administration. Prices are already starting to rise. He is a failed business person and multiple bankrupt, 24 time convicted felon and fraudster , who couldn’t even keep casinos open
It’s crazy that you have to pay for the parking, it’s just pure greed.
Im 58 years old and ive never been to Disney and im Proud of that !!
We stopped going about 6 years ago. Besides the cost becoming ridiculous you just spend all of your time in line. Disney has spent a lot of money and used up a lot of valuable real estate just to stage massive amounts of people in lines. If they put more attractions in those spaces people could actually enjoy themselves. If you want rides you will get much more for your money at just about any amusement park in the country. And ALL of their high dollar souvenir crap is junk made in China just as cheaply as possible. We love Disney cruises but the parks are a no go.
Ummmmm…… they were over there minding their business, you sought them out and went there, so spend the money and close up your jabber box Mr.
Unfortunately its a supply and demand issue. The demand is still somehow high so the prices must rise to fight overcrowding. I live in the Orlando area and it disturbs me how many passholder stickers I see on cars. Every time I see one I immediately think "oh you obviously like to waste your money". Disney is a scam thats just riding the coat tails of their old reputation.
HOLY SHYTE! A grand for one day.
After losing a lot of money for going Woke...no wonder
3:00 talk about price of toys, wait until Christmas. No dolls for you!
How else will they pay for their Black SnowWhites?
How can that place still be so packed? How are all these people affording it?
It's a one and done trip, and the memories are truly priceless. That being said, a trip to a less expensive place or for free is pretty good too.
Hell back in the 90's we spent $5,000 at Disney World it got cheaper 😂
Unfortunate how if Floridians wanted to experience being in a walkable city, they used to vacation in Disneyworld. From the Pacific Northwest, it's cheaper for me to fly to Tokyo (Japan) and spend a week in Disneyland Tokyo than it is to fly to Orlando (in the same country) and spend a week at Disneyworld.
That doesn't even taken into account things like flight and hotel costs, getting a rental car etc.
Biden fault
How could you enjoy it? Unless you’re a billionaire…
sick !
No thanks... ever.
I’m shocked that he is shocked by the cost. He didn’t know this already?
just think about the people who have to get a hotel room that is from 100 to 1000 per night.
just watch a disney movie instead.
Universe is better all around. Florida resident get all type of promotions.
Get a job there - free admission!
Shoulda went to great America
Universal FL family of 4, airfare,hotel, for 6 days 3,000.  5days of multi park passes runs 2,600.  Total without food 5,600. If you want 4 fast passes add about 500/day.
Yes!!! The lowest is $3k for two ppl not including transport, flight, etc
The fact that the child's greatest memory from that Disney trip was waiting in line with her family tells you that the most important thing is family being together, and not the ride that she is lining a long time for.
Suck it up Dad. Feel the magic.
McDonald's and Disneyland are now unaffordable for avg Americans. Our culture is destroyed. As a naturalized citizen I sit and wonder if it was worth the trouble to move here.
the most woke company there movies are losing a lot of money so they have to make up for it
I remember my parents would complain paying $45-$50 for California Disneyland. It was just 3 of us 🤦🏻‍♂️
Hell no
All you can do is laugh at these people and yet they keep going
I remember my parents would complain paying $45-$50 for California Disneyland. It was just 3 of us 🤦🏻‍♂️
Nope.
Craig owned  “ Flying Wheels “ automobile dealership in New Hampshire and has a great YouTube channel about running a used car dealership and!
Is this guy as stupid as he  seems? It's been this expensive for Forever! Nothing new to see here. If you can't afford this kind of vacation, don't take it!
Great job Mom and Dad!  Your daughter is kind, thoughtful and beautiful.
Nope!
Don't go to Disney then
SO MUCH TDS IN HERE, TRUMP HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PRICES IN DISNEY,
Because is made in USA  if was made in China will only cost total  $300
People are so nuts I  haven’t went there since’09 and didn’t look back way to expensive
The "REAL" magic was how easy it was to get $1300 out of your pocket.......you can almost hear the mouse laughing.
The newscaster is quick to blame Biden (2:21), red Florida has had nothing but Republican governors and Republican US senators for the past 25 years.
why is he complaining about being able to afford Disneyland?
According to our dear leader, your child doesn't need a light saber.  Maybe get him a pencil instead.
Gotta PAY to PLAY daddy😂😂😂
We have a saying,it's not  stupid who asks,but  stupid who pays.
I thought the ticket books were expensive!
They wanted open borders so anyone would come into this country except when it comes to their land. Why anyone would want to go to Disney is beyond me
It's called capitalism   fox noise you have 2 go its optional !!!
All the parks in every state are greedy you pay admission fee, then you have to pay for parking. How can a family afford to go?
Even these little fares are getting ridiculous in what they're charging. Also, it's a shame you can't take your kids out on a fun day without spending a couple $100 and they know it. I have to save to take my child to have great time
Wow 😮😳 that's insane 😲
I had three kids and a few times they wanted to go to a pricy place ...I would offer some cash instead.....and they were happy I saved a bunch.   We got a tear pass to Knots with the water park, parking pass included for about half the price of one day at Disneyland....it was as great.   Walt would be horrified
Ok beer and pretzel man
Last time I went to Disney was in 1988.. I was 18.. went with the family. I can't imagine the set of circumstances that would have to take place for me to end up at Disney ever again.
Smart girl, though Dad has a point.
I live 30 minutes away and I will never pay Disney period.
How have groceries gotten better?!?  This is an actual video about the outrageous current price of things!   Current costs
Greedflation, hyperinflation, wageflation , and inflation
If you ignore them, they will go away. There are other parks, but none are cheap. This is just extortion at this point. Is the juice worth the squeeze?
So unaffordable! Mr Disney is rolling over in his grave , so sad💔💔🇨🇦😭😭
I live 15 minutes away from Disneyland in SoCal and I used to go all the time when it was $20 to get in. Haven’t been since it was $25. That was probably 25-30 years ago.
Having gone to WDW many times I find it hard to believe that you had to pay $195/person for tickets into the park. And being a Florida resident there are breaks in the price.  Also, showing the bias from the fox "news" about how prices are so high but they were high under the last administration but are better now. Talk about lies.
My dad took our family of eight to Disneyland in 1960 and was visibly shaken by the prices at the box office.  It ended up cutting our vacation to California from Texas short by a week.
and inside the park its all stores what a joke go to universal instead
Not worth it.
They're taking advantage of ya, that's all these parks do it? It's crazy Kids can't even go have a little fun if the parents can't afford it. It's all for what they do
Every parents worst nightmare.
Give me a break; the cost is NOT STAGGERING.  The same amount of money in 1976 would be $211.  Why are Americans becoming tightwads with some things and $10 for coffee at Starbucks is OK?  Plus this guy looks like DeSanctimonious Junior
DISNEY COMPANY IS ON THEIR WOKE ERA.......MANY ADULTS WHO GREW UP FROM THE REAL ERA OF "WALT DISNEY" ARE😊 PISSED FROM THOSE NONESENSE........AND THE WHOLE IDEA OF DISNEY PARK ITSELF IS NOW VAGUE AND CONFUSING......JUST LIKE THE IDEALS OF WOKE MENTALITY OF TODAY
LOL, she blames the past administration for the state of things. It's only going to get worse under your boy Donnie 😵‍💫
Disney Florida is so much cheaper than going to Disney in California! He should be grateful for that.
Stop whining.   You knew.
You spent more money than I can make in a month I literally couldn’t afford that
lol she said with cost “ it got a little bit better under this administration “ for every lie FOX says they would go bankrupt in one segment.
When I was a child, dad didn't have to be a business owner to afford to take us to Disneyland.
Exactly!! It is ridiculous how expensive it is. It used to be $20 for a day ticket at Disney.
No one is forcing you to go... Why are people so stupid.
There are lot of people with lot of money, I cannot afford to buy a large pizza !
I quit giving the rat my money many years ago.
Haven't been to Disneyland since 1988!!  Does anyone know how the price compares to Knott's Berry Farm, Universal, or Six Flags?
Idiots.
This is insane. The greed is unbelievable. If nothing changes soon we will have a society were the working poor and middle class will not be able to afford anything. It will be like France before the French Revolution, a few will drink out of golden cups and have everything and the masses will go hungry to bed at nite.
Yet, the place is still PACKED.
Disneys one of the least expensive vacations for me. As a Florida resident, you get an annual pass. You have no parking fee with that. Then you have to come a fair amount, but if you do, especially during weekdays and away from the busiest times, the area hotels are super affordable. We eat only a banana, or fruit at the parks to hold us over, and maybe once in a while an ice cream. We drink the free ice water they give to everyone, and eat outside of the park, or have a pic nick of sandwiches and chips in the car in a cooler. We really have a blast and if I had more money to spend, likely wouldn't enjoy it as much eating the restaurants, or at quick service. Of course my parents brought me back in the 70s and 80s, and this is how we always went. Some get to caught up in Disney everything, and you'll pay for thinking only Disney. Be tough like they were back in the day, and enjoy the park with a nice ham sandwich in the car.
We go to the lake . We haven’t been to Disney in 25 years …never again …. I would never go there again .
Stopped going to wdw years ago. Sold my dvc and never looked back. Now we go to world Marriott Orlando and do just fine.
5 kids  You chose it
Here in California we are bad we need to make the switch to universal passes or something diff to hopefully make disney realize there park prices are to dam high.
Lol.  Complaining about prices AND crowd size. Lower the prices and how many people do they think will be jamming themselves in there? This guy and everyone complaining about high prices are tools.  And these prices were unknown to him? C'mon.  This is capitalism sprinkled with reality.
I don't know why people still fall for that scam That is disney world, Bunch of fools in costumes , fake characters with overpriced food overprice tickets, You can have so much more fun doing ten other things else where with that money with your kids💯
1400$? I can ignorantly say I thought tickets were like 50$. I can also say I would've never spend that on anything Disney.
Maybe he should do some research on the costs before he actually goes there?  Then he wouldn’t be so “shocked”.  🙄🙄. So tired of people bashing Disney.   🙄🙄
China's paradise!
The crime is using Walter Disney's name.
$1400 for a day in Disney is waayy too much. Disney..needs to reevaluate and make it more affordable for families to attend...but right there and then is why the dad paid for his kids as the response from the daughter is priceless and well worth the effort and sacrifice for a appropriate and meaningful response...and that there is why he paid $1400...so you have kids that have and grow up to have a good head on their shoulders.
Never !!!!!!   No way !!!!!      Never ever Will  waist my time at Disney
So who is going to epic universe say yes and say Disney is for kids 1-10 and say universe is for 10-100
There are so many beautiful things to see in this world that don’t cost even close to this
As a kid (or an adult), I wouldn't have the patience for crowds and lines like that.  Definitely not worth it!
Disney is for rich people only. My daughter went there a couple of months ago. She could afford it but I did not ask her what it cost. I can only imagine! Probably a couple of thousand! They are both professionals with 2 kids. I know they ate there and bought souvenirs also. Luckily they had her husbands mother's house to;stay overnight at. I think Disneyland is one big rip off but I can't say that to her. It would just cause a riff with my daughter.
He's not in shock. He went there knowing what it costs and looking to make content and get internet attention.
MY WIFE THINKING LONG AND HARD JUST FOR $120 FAMILY TICKET FOR ZOO LET ALONE OVER $1000
You voted for it!
Fox you interviewed him and you may have wanted to help out and donate some money towards the bill 😢
GREED! And now under vile, disgusting, disgraceful, tRump & his maga-maggot incompetent administration it's only getting worse! 😡
They keep spending it though.  Pointless
Keep worshipping Disney as if you can't get enough of it and this place will only get more expensive.
People should stop going … Disney sucks now & the prices are not WORTH it ever!!!!!!! Stayyyy away people-
Dad's like, we can spend time and talk at home for free. All without the threat of kidnapping. F Disney.
Who even goes there anymore, way overpriced 😂🎉
They need to make up for all their horrible movie losses. Stay away from Disney. Everything they do blows.
Why do we still deal with Disney - I have 4 kids and I have stopped going there - it is crazy!
It's always been alot
This isn’t just Disney this is everywhere!
I have never been to disney world,had a chance to go when i was like 12 years old. Glad i have never been,those greed monster do not deserve my money.
Florida resident here.We live less than an hour from Orlando attractions. I can promise I won't knowingly give Disney one cent of our money. It makes my day to hear Disney cry that admissions are down, especially during the "off-season". The adds will run constantly on the local TV trying to get residents to go. Pound sand Disney! Absolute rip off for an amusement park. Disney has totally crapped all over the residents for years. Then they enter the political ideology realm. No matter what they do, cut prices to almost nothing to raise them 75 times, I don't really care. Hope I live long enough to see the property eaten back up by the swamp! I'll use my National Parks annual pass and enjoy what this great country truly stands for.
$1,400? I spent that much today, it was on prescription glasses… and it was two for one deal
Disney is for the well to do, is not for the hood. Mickey is not a Socialist he is 100% American Capitalist.
I went once and that was enough. I don’t like throwing my money out of the window. I’d rather take a plane ✈️ to a distant island or country for that money. ✌🏽
They could have taken sandwiches.
Remember, Florida residents get a discount on park tickets, everyone else does not!
What a waste of money.
Im 54 and NOBODY in my family has been to or has any desire to go to Disney and we are all still surviving.   I lived in Clearwater Beach for 2 years and at that time a group of us paid a monthly fee and went to Busch gardens with our young children.  We were able to go as many times a week as we wanted and had a blast.    Guess what?  Everyone that goes and Pays those ridiculous prices are the exact reason why they keep jacking up the prices.  So nobody should be complaining when you choose to spend that.  I have no sympathy.
You would need about 300 million views in order for that video to pay for the 1 day cost of Disney trip.
It's not worth it especially if you have to wait in lines.
Disney’s next annoying song?  🎶 “It’s a broke world after all”🎶
STUPIDITY!
They are magically greedy.
😊 ❤ 🇺🇲 Disney has become a place for the Elite.  Most Castles of America are what? In Ruins.
I might as well travel Europe.
The lightsaber for $44.95 sounded like the only decent price there. And even that was a bit high
Craig has a youtube channel called Flying Wheels, he's a used car dealer.
That’s without airfare lol
It is not worth it because of the crowds.
That’s one reason why we never go to Disney, also they are promoters of LGBTQ+ nonsense for children!
East fix. STOP GOING, and use your buying power as your vote to rebel.
Don’t go. Let Disney go broke.
Bye bye evil Disney do some research
NOT WORTH IT
After this year, we plan to no longer renew. I miss not only the cost, the atmosphere at Disney. The employees that are working for Disney, act like they really enjoy making customers feel WELCOMED! JK! I think we all can agree that before we leave the park, we should receive a call regarding how was our stay and also include leaving the park Surveys to complete on the app and also for those who are not computer literate, fill out a questionnaire on how our visit went. This will help with growth and improvement. Such feedback would offer valuable insights into customer satisfaction and highlight areas that need attention. Moreover, implementing this process would not only enhance the overall experience for visitors but also reinforce Disney's commitment to excellence and customer care. Overall, these improvements could lead to increased customer loyalty and positive word-of-mouth, ensuring that Disney stays a beloved destination for families and individuals alike.
He runs a successful car lot and youtube channel so he can probably easily afford a trip to Disney.
OMG! Crazy expensive. Shame on Disney!
If the best part of your daughter’s trip was waiting in line with her family because they got to talk, then it’s time get some camping gear and visit one of the many wonderful state and national parks in Florida. We raised our family camping and they still talk about the memories they made and the great family time we experienced.
yhea right no inflation
I'm not surprised that Disney are now ripping people off to their faces ...
boycott these commies! losers!!!!
About $180 per ticket… expensive trip for a big family.
Dude paid $1300. He wearing them ears during sx. Hahahahaha
Disney doesn't care about American families. They only care about who can pay. They're going to build a new park in the middle east, they'll get all the new tech and rides while their parks here are neglected and pricing families out
😂😂😂
And that's why I go to dollywood
What a complete bell-end.
Stop being so cheap… You should not go on vacation if you have to question prices. My kids are 12. They went almost every year since they were 2. We moved on to other places like Thailand or Laos or Hawaii. Disney will never loose business. Think about all of the kids who are born and will visit. It’s a cycle. I am not rich. Just middle class. We enjoy our vacations.
Pay for grooming?
I’ve lived in FL my whole life. Been to Disney a lot! I love Disney but I’m telling you it’s not worth the price it is now at ALL!! I can get in for free and I don’t care to go there because of the crowd and cost of everything in there.
Woke bs
No one had said those trips were affordable.  The tourist paid that price, and more. It is a good place to go to. However,  Disney should have better packages.
Sounds about right
It is disgusting.  Every single part of disney, from the wokeness to the blood sucking charges
Lmmfao that you/people pay that price for a company that promotes child mo!$%tation..
Florida residents get in cheaper. But as long as people go and pay these stupid prices they will keep charging more .
Me,wife,daughter , 2grandkids.    10 grand
Universal >>> Disney well in about evreything even pricing
Fook Dissney
The problem here is, people will pay it and that's why they keep charging so much.
Looking forward to Fox showing the empty shelves and higher prices soon.
That is quite a Price for a Day Trip to Walt Disney World for a Day and as a Matter of Fact, I remember going to Walt Disney World for the Very First Time in February 2015
Yeah these theme parks are going crazy.  Sea World in San Antonio parking cost $47.99 the week or two after the local spring break.  I saw the changeable signs going up to 78.99  inside of the ticket booth, who knows what that is for.  The lines were long, you had to wait for food (the pizza by the dolphin show, 20 min) , half the kids rides were down.  These theme parks will eventually find out why day trippers may be the last ones that can afford it.
Pre planning is essential. Coupons, dates, hotels all.matter. I would rather travel to another location for that amount!
No wonder their earnings were though the roof , stock up 11% from ...I'm sorry STUPID people like this paying through the nose for a bad time.
Guy has been living in a cave..should have spent the night in a hotel...$$$   yes he'll never forget it....next time go to BUSH GARDENS..   wait NERVER MIND...😊😊
My husband & I went to Cuba for a week plane & all inclusive hotel & it was cheaper than this!
I would much rather go to universal or sea world
Fkn Disney GARBAGE!  I remember when i was a kid in the 80s and tickets were just $12!!!  And every ride, show and experience was soo memorable an was never like that ever again in modern times! 👊🏼🤜🏼🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🤦🏼‍♂️🖕🏼
Disgusting.
I wouldn't give Disney a cent to fund the propaganda they are trying to force on children these days.
So add exchange for Canadians.  Not happening for us. Bummer Disney.
D.W.D.: down with disney...
Yeah. Not just in Florida! California as well! Definitely not the average Joe to spend money on Disneyland. Also, lightning pass is something you have to pay extra. Remind you, it’s just for one day! You can pay 1,400 to 2,200, it depends on what you spend on.
WOW…..$$ouch$$
Disneys got to make up their losses elsewhere 🤣 Disney is a sad case, Walt would not like this at all. 👎
Woke people buying, woke things just look at the snow white Rachel Zegler wth would you pay for that 🤦‍♂️
I grew up poor. The closest I got to Mickey Mouse was when we went to the dump & I fed the rats!😂
Aren’t they always expensive 😮😅 ?
He obviously had the money for it which isn’t a knock on him but seriously, nobody was wringing your arm. And the lady acting like she relates with us is also laughable. We live in a gullible society.
It's called capitalism. As long as that park is full every day the prices will continue to rise. Their only allengence is to their share holders.
Why am I not surprised that the anchor felt the need to take a jab at the Biden administration—this segment is supposed to be about Disney, not politics.
I don't watch their garbage movies, and I'd never waste my money and time in that place.
Walt envisioned the park as being for every one. It's now for rich people.
What a moron and a loser. When I go it's strength VIP treatment.
Dad made a ton of money for the video.
I watched the wonderful world of Disney growing up but I don't want anything to do with Disney which has so much Woke nonsense. Leviticus 18:22
It’s unimaginable the high cost for a day, pure greed, been there never go back, spend the day in lines😊
What a moron and a loser
I agree that it's expensive, but given the title of the video, I was expecting something a lot more shocking. I mean, if you paid $975 just to enter the park (tickets and parking), then I feel like the additional $415 (ish) for everything else during the day shouldn't be much of a surprise to you.
Fun and necessities have become too pricey for our blood.
Universal is cheaper
Anyway you go 5 heads is rough.  Even 1,500 per season pass that’s 7500 a year. Which is what a week vacation is.  So buy the season pass
Why is this news? It’s a given when you sign up to go to anything Disney
Its funny to think, when I was in High School in the early 2000's, an annual pass was $330 (including parking) and we thought that was ridiculous...
He's from FL, did he think it was free?
It's simple Don't
I remember 24 years ago a girl at school was talking about how she went to Disneyworld and I thought to myself that her parents must be rich. I don't know. All I know is that all my parent talked about was how she didn't have money for anything.
If you guys can afford to go to Disneyland and this guy can afford to pay $1,000 for a day for his family God bless him but there are people now in United States who are suffering from hungry and lack of housing. So instead of the orange dictator spending in 92 million dollars for a military parade for his birthday North Korean style let's give money for the hungry children hungry seniors and give benefits for our veterans
I never took my kids to Disney, I took them to Europe instead and probably spent the same money as a whole week with flight and hotel would it have cost me to go to Disney. An unforgettable experience with no long waiting lines
0:30 That YouTube icon in the back. Says he can afford it. EASILY
You can save money by bringing your own food
Seriously 😳 looks like the beach with ice box filled with beer & ice cream 🍨 is just 50. Bucks Las Vegas also a 500% overpriced tax on tax and resort fees to steal money from you. Like at what point do people not wake up?
Those are no news!!! I have not been in Disney I the last 6 or 7 years, prices are insane.👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
The Lightening Passes USED to be FREE. First come, first serve for that particular ride. At 9am, again at 1pm and again at 5pm. THEY WERE FREE! What a rip-off Disney has become.
He has 500k followers on his channel and is a small business owner... not saying it wasn't expensive but 1.4k is absolutely nothing to him lol. The video generation many times over the 1.4k.
Big ripoff.
F*** Disney. We will never go there again!
Stupid anyone going to Disney checks prices before hand if you couldn't afford it you should have stayed home. Now your complaining about your own judgement!
It's like standing in the summer sun... Then saying to everyone that it's hot...   What is wrong with people....
People are sheep
It seems Disney is for celebrities only
My wife and I tried right before covid to do the disney experience since our kids were grown. Went to Epcot for two days for the food from around the world.   I did feel it was very over priced, very hot, super long lines.  I wouldnt go back if you gave me the tickets for free.  What was Awesome in the Orlando area is Blue Spring State Park, with the Manatee's.  Just a great park and fair pricing, a good time with out waiting in line for 2.5 hours.
Worth every penny 😊
Jump the fence loser
So $1500 in you find out your daughter just likes standing in line with her family…thats golden. That shows us, in the end even if we cant afford fancy outings we always have each other 🫶🏽
Waste of money. So much better things a family can do.
I thank God that I never went to Disney.  Never took my kids there.  I’ll never take my grandkids there.  I’d rather give my money away to someone than to go to Disney.
I remember Walt Disney.  He’d be turning over in his grave from shame.
He should have went completely Homer Simpson on Bart Simpson, when her response to the question of what was your favorite part, she said standing in line talking with her family. You made your dad pay all that money to do exactly what you can do literally every single day of the week in the comfort of your own home? You made him spend over $1,400 so you could simply talk to him? I think he is the strongest person ever mentally, because I think I would have tackled her to the ground at that point....
Lol this is news?
Don't over pay for visiting the Evil Empire..... there's cheaper entertainment people.... open your eyes....
"THE PRICES ARE TOO HIGH! IT COSTS WAY TOO MUCH! *NO ONE CAN AFFORD THESE RIDICULOUS DISNEY WORLD PRICES,* AND I'M A FLORIDA RESIDENT!" Also: "Oh yeah. And the lines were too long." Make your argument make sense, buddy.
I love the little girl she says I had a good time at Disneyland but the best time she had at Disneyland was standing in line visiting with her family not Disneyland but her family!!!!!!
I saw this on Reddit I thought it was wild
Walk in the park or on the beach.   Free.
Last time i went to a Rays game on Sunday afternoon it set me back $360 for parking, 2 decent seats, 2 hotdogs, 2 beer's, and one popcorn. That was 5 years ago.
If they build it, they won’t come.
your first mistake you went to disney next time head to sixflags
He’s the idiot that paid knowing it was expensive. There’s no penny pinching if you can shell out 1400 for a day.
Never have kids 😂😂
LOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLOL
So, what's the solution? Disney is already very expensive, yet it still attracts huge crowds every day. The lines are long, and if prices were lowered, even more people would likely go. So what should be done?
He should have stayed home, not take the kids then guilt them about it.
lol family man sucker 😂 🤡🐑
I went to Disneyland in the 90s. It was ridiculous then. I think for 2 people and a child it was 40.00 and thats like 80.00 today now for some hamburgers. The fairs are just as bad too.
24+years ago , maybe more,   Disneyland   for 5 days, both parks,  cost me $250.  ...........before that,     it was less than half . Now you need to  take out a loan
When the disney store was still open in the mall here, i would literally avoid walking by it with my kids cuz theyd beg to go in and i already knew their prices were outrageous. This was back in 2012
To think how many poor kids will never get to experience Disneyland
Mikey has to eat isn't he.
Its ridiculous. Just alone in parking fees they make 500 million a year
Overpriced, over-crowded, and woke. Totally not worth it.
Disney is a scam! A rip-off! You are the stupid one for wasting your money on woke crap!😅
i cant fathom spending that much on a day trip to an amusement park....F that
Bro that’s cheap lol if you can’t afford that then you broke !
Does anyone remember E tickets?
If everyone got together and stopped going , they’ll drop prices to bring everyone back . Same thing with sporting events and big arena games
Oh we have a trip planned next month for 1500 per day I will cancel trip already paid 1800 for flights
THAT IS CRAZY. Never been to any Disney parks, and not going to start.
I was living in Florida when Disney opened in 1971.  Use to go 2 - 3 weekends a month and loved it.  Now, living back in Florida again, but I wouldn't go to Disney now even if they give me FREE Tickets!!!  Just the extras in the park would wipe me out.  DISNEY needs  to get real!
Mickey & mini cost a pretty penny,  when i saw the bill was $1400 bucks , i turned around & punched DONALD DUCK! THE 👀
Back in 2022 I went to Disney, it is a nightmare! Full of people everywhere, hot as hell, and waiting 40 minutes for one ride. The experience was not worth it.
Disneylines
The last time I went to Disneyland I paid $50.
I started going to Disneyland right towards the end of ticket stubs to get on a ride, then it was park entry ticket then by the 90's it wasn't worth the price to me and have never been since, plus I won't go support woke companies.
Why is anyone still going to Disney? I don't get it. It's a complete waste of money.
How stupid are you? If you really want to give your kids an experience why don't you donate to the National Park foundation and take your kids camping instead Disneyland is overrated it's expensive and if you don't want to pay that then don't go
This is why I quit yearly trips back in 1995.
Hmmm i wonder why💀
Why would ANYONE wanna support that evil organization? Never in this house!
Who is shocked by this
Is Mr. Stowell living under a rock?! The sky-high pricing has been happening since the scamdemic. Bob Iger World pushed me out the door financially FIVE years ago. I called and tried to book a trip and couldn't believe it was over $1,600 for air fare, lowest price level hotel and basic tickets. Cancelled everything and did something they would not like: I called their enemy Universal. My god, the price difference was like night and day...
Will they need to recoup all the money they lost on all that woke lgbtq crap movies they make
Wow thats how fans are treated in 2025, dayum hard pass.
We went when I was a kid in 1978. No Epcot or anything like that yet, and the Hall of Presidents was new. My little brother was sick, so he and mom didn't go, it was me, my dad, my uncle and cousin, they paid for themselves. Day trip, no hotel, and daddy still shelled out probably between 3-400 dollars that day, and that was a lotta money in 1978.
Nobody can afford to spend a day at the park and go eat dinner at downtown Disney.  Its always been like this
Im 77. When i was a kid if we got to go to the lake swimming and eating hotdogs we thought we'd gone to heaven.
I would and never have gone to that ridiculous place!!
Best part was not having to pay for it.
No regular family can afford Disney. What a waste. Just their bottled waters are like 8 bucks. Give me a break!
So your throwing Disney under the bus while advertising for the  With the Ears. You are not right in your head
I took my family of 19 to a castle in Tuscany for a week for &7,500. So essentially Disney is ~4 times more expensive and the food sucks.
You choose to be there not a single soul in the world told you to goo but yeah if you got $1400 to spend on Disney you ain’t worried about money
Nothing for Nothing this guy owns a car dealership and is worth Million$
This is just not worth it. We’ve gone to Disney in Anaheim and it’s just endless scams, long lines, severely overpriced food and few moments of actual doing anything
LET'S GO FELON!
I went a year ago and you have to “schedule” your ticket in. You can’t just walk in on a whim. It certainly didn’t help reduce wait time on rides or make it less crowded. Still waited an hour or more for the better rides and the Genie pass is a scam. You can only use it once per day on each ride and the genie pass is not good for the more popular rides. Scam! It would literally take you three or four days to get anything out of going and to be able to go on every ride. Rip off.
Fuk those childgroomers at Disney
He can spend $1400. But cannot buy American products
Also...I assume that Florida man gets the discount for being a Florida resident...so that may have been a discounted rate?? Whoa.
Relatable? Pinching pennies? People pinching pennies don’t go to Disneyland. He obviously knew what kind of money he needed to have and he had it. People are willing to pay so of course it’s expensive. This is ridiculous
Must be nice to spend that much in one day. We poor people can't afford that much  😱😱😱😱😱😱
Complaining & yet wears the Mickey EARS T F 🤡
Its only for rich people, blowing out so much money for few hours of fun, never fall for these stuff only if u have alot extra money, toys buy at walmart
That's ridiculous.  Mickey Mouse can kiss my a**.
Crazy people spend so much fo disney
I loved how the Dad teared up after being caught off guard by hearing what his daughter’s favorite thing was. I’m happy they went. Time with your family is precious and it’s all the little moments that end up being the memories that last a lifetime. ❤️
after Walt  left.. . . .the spiral began. .....and so did the Salary &  Greed of  all the upper  Corporate  schmucks .    Disney corp  began more venturing out into other worldly   ventures,  and faded out the  original  and very successful  Park attractions......The raising of park  prices, food prices,  hotel prices  was     being  spent  on outside unrelated  ventures.   Now we have  openly boasting Trans  employees,   a remake of vocabulary that outlaws   male and female terms,    confusing  verbiage      and catering to other  woke agendas   ......all the while the corp leaders are individually   raking in  60 to 176  million in yearly salary  .   Now come the decades old and  well loved rides being stripped  of its original nostalgia   to  be  politically correct to not offend the alphabet's .  None of  Walts characters were deviants back then....now it has to be accommodating ???    Walts  vision was for  familys  at a reasonable cost.   Not any more.    .........and reading the comments below.....I am not alone   in boycotting the  New  Woke   of what once was a fun place  to visit at  a tolerable cost.
Is this a surprise? C’mon. Anyone shocked is living in a very narrowed world.
I HATE ANYTHING that Disney stands for and refuse to support them in any way. They are WAY TOO greedy.
Dad is blocking name of utube channel.
I refuse to
How about those Mikey ears?
arm and a leg
Thousands of people go daily. It’s packed. People can afford n that’s why they are there.  If they cannot afford they can stay home or go to park
It's OK. Trump will just put a tariff on it and all will be well. By the way, no one told the guy he had to go or that he had to buy the 37 dollar pair of ears for his head.
Being single & no kids doesn’t seems so bad does it!
Wow. Well, I won't be affording Disney never.
For 5 people?  That's not bad!  What did you expect?!
Your supposed to stay at a Resort too... at 200 a night... just for a lower grade Resort... but Resort Hop For Free and See All Kinds of Good things on the Cheap.. yeah Disney Springs... is Money Trap of High End Everything... Happiest Place on Earth If you have the Money. I'm Due Back.. Went twice on 2 week trips a few years back.. but im Due again
Special place in hell for Mickey Mouse
Well if Disney would quit making woke movies that don’t  make money maybe they could reduce the cost of a day at Disney! But would they? I seriously doubt it but it’s a good thought.
The cost of groceries and gasoline has gotten BETTER under this new crappy administration?!    Is that newscaster out of her mind?
I've never had a desire to go there ever
So what do you reckon trump can fix this l doubt it a billionaire is only for himself and the wealthy trumps tariffs are going to break everyone it has only just begun
Thats pretty much what we spent in 2023 for a family of 5.
That's nothing. Add airfare and hotel costs for many families. Easily a $10-20k vacation.
Disney=not for the privilege it's for the rich only.
Lightning pass is totally disgusting, people with more expendable money, can pay more to expedite their ride  while at the same time creating a much longer wait for regular paying people!  Wealth discrimination at its best! F-Disneyland haven't been there in 27years, and never will again,even though i can easily afford the Lpass.
Walt would be rolling in his grave
Blue Spring isn't far from Orlando.
Speak the truth Fox News. It’s gotten worse since the last administration. The fact is Trump has caused everything to go up in price and the market and economy to go into recession. That’s the facts!!!
Just curious on how this reporter can say things are better now with a straight face!
Why would anyone take a vacation there? Why would you? So many beautiful places to see in our country! Unplug. Disney sucks!
I took my family 2 grown sons and 1 daughter-law to Disney World 2 years ago. I expected to be expensive. My biggest  gripe was the quality of the meals. We ate a number of park restaurants, and most meals were pretty  unremarkable, not that bad but not that good either, but they all had 5 star prices. The only restraint that I ate at that was really good was the German buffet at Epcot Center, and it was $60.00 per person. When we ate  the Italian restaurant, the pasta was over boiled and the meranra sauce was totally unseasoned tomato sauce. I don't  mind paying through the nose if I can get some value for my buck
Disney is for millionaires. Thats how they keep out the rif raft. Trailer trash and homeless
Here is how you solve that problem: Don't go to Disney.
I COULD EAT WITH THAT MONEY 4 8 MONTHS
1000 for 5 people doesn't sound bad to me. Disney is a high quality luxury option. It's like when you go to a cheaper gym VS a more expensive one. There is a big difference in what you get. Quality costs extra, try Six flags instead or skip it altogether-it's not a necessity
Disney has always been ridiculous to me. It’s literally cheaper to take a family trip on a cruise to the islands. The ships are floating hotels, 24/7 buffet, entire water parks, shows for kids and your room is cleaned like any hotel room. I’ve seen parents have to make their kids get off the ship to go to the beach!
Definitely get the lightning pass otherwise you waste so much time in line.
I took my daughter to Disney in Japan.  We did not pay so much money... We bought some food, but just snacks, busy enjoying the attraction.  We also took public transportation, that saves money too. 9400 yen per adult ticket.  We spent around 3000 yen for food, snacks. and train ticket is maybe 1000 yen.
All these companies, Casinos, etc with their multi million dollar CEO’s keep going to the well and gouging us with their inflated prices . The well is about dry, people don’t have that kind of money it’s ridiculous these companies are going to reign in their stake holders wages!!
I wonder what Walt Disney would think if he saw his greedy his amusement park has become?
2:23 'It's gotten a little bit better.' For whom exactly? Because it sure hasn’t for the American people. Then again, look who’s talking, a bleach-blond bimbo on Fox Lie News.
Lmao keep protesting because it ain't working.
Obviously he didn't do his preparing for the trip. Disney has been extremely expensive for years. Where has this guy been? If you have to complain about the cost, dont go.
Trump hasn't fixed it yet? 😂
lol I was asked if I liked Disney world, I said I’ve never been and I don’t want to go
Drug dealers, immigrants, and low lives all can afford the magical world of disney . Hardworking men and their families 🖕
Come to Shanghai Disney the prices here will blow your mind and will want you to boycott Disney in US
And that is why I have not been there since junior High school, I am 62.
The prices will stay high like at McDonald's cuz normies period
for an entire day of entertainment for 6 people. Seems like a decent bargain.
Cinderella's moustache wax ain't free, and Disney doesn't go with the cheap stuff.
Disney is owned by perverts
🤣🤣🤣
Just like higher education in this country, Disneyland is Now ONLY for those with money! Never been and now at this cost, never will.
It is prettt obvious it isn't cheap! 😂😂😂😂😂. How "smart" does one have to be!  Before you go too Disney check prices in stuff then, calculate what it could cost 😅. Do the math first before just getting up and going. Especially if you already gone before...you should know you will not spend $100 😂 please do not be dumb! Employees may not get paid big many do get many perks that you will never get anywhere else!    I went when I was a kid in 80s( I don't know cost ).   Then went in 2016. We did stay at "disney all stars"( we loved it! )😂 was pricey but we ( MY WIFE )....NOT ME.. had done the math for 1 week. Was worth it! We did end up spending little more. We also took advantage of the stay, pretty much everything it offers that one has to check! Thank you Disney. If you are truly humble and really nice/polite to employees inside Disney in some area some may give you something free. You just NEVER know! I ended up getting a free desert free that was worth $10. 😅 it was free that what matters.    We plan on going once our 2nd child is at least 8 years old...another 5-6 years to go!
F-ck di$ney!   They've gone completely ideological in their parks, in their TV shows and in their movies.  They won't get one red cent of my money, if I can help it.
The workers at disney were so nasty ...never again!
Do not go.
That last question... answered said it all ... family first no matter where you are. OK FOLKS off the public park we go!  ;) Much much cheaper and MORE high value.
KEEP  GOING... They will keep increasing prices. BOYCOTT Disney
This is why I never go back to Disneyland!!
Shove those food prices
All these companies, Casinos, etc with their multi million dollar CEO’s keep going to the well and gouging us with their inflated prices . The well is about dry, people don’t have that kind of money it’s ridiculous these companies are going to reign in their stake holders wages!!
Wel,l he made his money back if 8 million people watched his video. Fake!
Isn't that a shame.  WAIT A MINUTE!!!!!!!  DID SHE SAY FAMILIES CAN'T AFFORD GASOLINE OR GROCERIES UNDER THE "LAST" ADMINISTRATION?  What the F are these liars/idiots at Fox smoking???  I'm giving this a dislike and you should, too.
It’s wild there.  $20 for a crap hot dog and bottle of water.
Dump Disney, woke greed. My family will not support Disney parks or movies ever again. The Disney movies are loosing millions. Go woke, go broke.
Ridiculous!   Insane to spend that much for 1 day for a family.  ESPICALLY these days.
Disney has to recover all the money they had lost with their failure movies.
3:20 ❤❤❤ What a perfect answer. Soo sweet and a massive unintentional disney burn 🎉
It just goes to show you how many years it's been since I last went to Disney the day pass was $60 for Florida resident. What a rip of Disney has become.
The last time I was at Disney,   was early 2000es.   It was the same park as the early 70es. When I was child
He made his money back plus with the video.
I wonder what Walt would have thought about what's going on in his parks today.  I don't remember, growing up in the 60's if he was a greedy basturd or just wanted famlies to have fun and make it affordable.  Can anyone remeber?  I've never been to any of his parks.  Guess I'll never be going.  I can't afford it.
$30 parking is a bargain. I pay $50 to park at concerts in Los Angeles.  However, the last time I went to Disneyland, or anything amusement park, was in the late 80s.  Disney happily raises prices every year and the other amusement parks raise their prices as well.  All I ever hear is how crowded Disneyland is, despite the prices.  Why?
0:30 best Dad with Minnie ears in the world!! ❤❤
So glad we aren’t a “Disney Family” for multiple reasons. Money better spent at a National Park honestly
dont have kids. simple as that. and watch the incels come for me in the comments hahahaha🤣
Expensive fun and only going to get more expensive
Prices to cover those Woke Movies 🎥 they’re making 😳😏😬
Waste your money just to go and see woke people.
Disney said about 6 years ago that they were going to be increasing prices in order to reduce foot traffic. $1400 a day is not a lot of money for some people.
I grew up in Orange County California. I remember buying a basic annual pass for $100! (Early 80’s) I haven’t been to Disney Land for years because of the reasons discussed in this video.
Ha keep giving your money to woke Disney.
Disney sets the park prices!,
I rather to go oakland fairyland 😂Disneyland is suck 😂🎉
What would Walt say?
I remember when Disneyland was $17.00 for admission and a book of A-E tickets in 1983.  Went once in the 1960s with my grandmother, once in the 1970s with a group of high school friends, once in 1983 with a couple of college friends, and again in 1984 with visiting friends from Scotland.   Although I had fun on those four visits, I never found myself ever wanting to back go back after that fourth Disneyland excursion.  There were just too many better things to go do.  That parents will pay what it costs now for the whole family to go is mind-bending.
That father must be living under a rock if he's shocked about prices for a Disney trip in 2025.
wth? this isnt news! In so cal, we used to go every year, now its impossible. last time we went three years ago (star wars) we got on SEVEN rides! NOT WORTH IT...btw do NOT  go to Disney resorts either,,, such as Hawaii. Giant rip off.
Its no difrent in Los Angeles.  I will let you in on a little secret.  If you know someone in a wheelchair. It works like a preferred ticket for the entire groop. LOL My niece has been to disneyland more times than she can count. Not with me by the way i'm on the whole Boycott thing too.
He's a millionaire...Crying Wheels at it again
He looks a little like Ron DeSantis 🧐
DAY TRIP TO DISNEY, 1400.00 FINDING OUT YOUR KID HAD FUN BEING WITH THE FAMILY AND SOCIALIZING TOGETHER. PRICELESS.
Those cast members keep demanding raises.
Gets expensive supporting Satan. It can cost you your sole.
Bye - bye disney...long ago .
Smile on your children's faces - priceless.  Don't be a cheapskate.
Lmao what is this guy a rookie? Who in 2025 still thinks Disney trip is going to cost under 10k? Wake up home boi
I haven't been to Disneyland since 2008 & entrance fee back then was $68.
I remember a few years back we wanted to go as a family of 6 was going to be almost $500 dollars so we passed then because it was too much. I don't even see how Disney is relevant anymore at those prices. They should shut it down and turn it into low cost condos for retired people or something useful.
Sick. Walt Disney is rolling around in his freezer.
Sorry Dad, but you look ridiculous with the Minnie ears
Disney have been robbing families for years… and will continue to do so.
Definitely not worth it, for that kind of money I can take a trip down to Caribbean or vacation somewhere a lot better then an overcrowded park with tons of lines everywhere
Id rather pay my house payment for 2 months then waste one day at a lame park made for kids owned by child molesters  Iv never even been and don't ever ever plan on going....
Attendance is up however.
Exactly why when it comes to Disney you have to steal. Aka get your moneys worth.?
Going to Disneyland in Tokyo only cost me $56 for a single day, and food was only $15.
This guy is like a better looking version of Ron Desantis
What a waste of $1,400.  You could have just taken a nice relaxing trip to the lake and the great outdoors for less than $200.
Day trip is pointless from what I hear, you can't see much of anything.
Yup and stand in lines for HOURS!
It's nice how this Fox host STILL MANAGED to take a dig a Biden regarding this "story" lol
AND you stand in line for hours then at the end of the day you realize you only rode 3 rides!
The lady was saying that people can’t afford groceries or pay for things and then she was like oops  I mean in the last administration-it’s a little better now
ROB YOU COMING ROB YOU GOING..all to have fun with the family..disgusting
Been 10 yrs. Since we went to Disneyland. 5 days hopper pass. Total trip 5k
This is why I will never go to any Disney Park. Over-priced for little value.
I would never go to Disney.  Who has this kind of money??? We're pulling hair to try to buy food at Walmart and not walk out with with a bill over $200 frickn dollars
That's more than I get paid in social security for the whole month what are these people nuts😮
Dollywood. Carowinds.
Fox still blaming Biden for to Disney..and can't believe Fox said it's much better 😂😂😂
Someone has to subsidize all the film flops and unwatchable new Star Wars content.
This is the biggest issue with human nature—we never stick together when it counts. At some point, we all need to unite and boycott the places taking advantage of us. Destinations like Disneyland, cruise ships, and Las Vegas have gotten completely out of control. Since when does Las Vegas charge for parking? If we collectively refused to accept these ridiculous fees, prices would have to drop, or at least these businesses would stop nickel-and-diming us over every little thing—like paying just to park our cars. We need everyone on board, even those who can afford these prices. Yes, there might be short-term consequences—people could lose jobs or see reduced hours—but if we don’t push back now, it’ll only get worse. And don’t even get me started on tipping culture. These days, you can’t grab a coffee, order takeout, or even use a self-checkout without someone shoving a tip screen in your face. Enough is enough.
Disney what's once was the icon of entertainment as gone off the edge has lost all vision is redoing and destroying movies
Trying to say that high prices were from the previous administration, yeah right. This is going on during the current one with dookie Don the traitorous con lol. Plus dookie Don sank the economy before he left last time and the Biden administration during it's 4 years was just trying to repair as much as it could of Trump's debacle. Good old  Faux news lol.
Half his tax return spent in one day! No thank you.
It’s mind blowing to me how packed Disney is, people can’t afford groceries but they can still afford to go to Disneyland or Disney World
Up next: Water is wet.
I wouldn't give you a dime for the whole place
Stay far far away from the place!
This guy has 3 kids?????
Nothing, and I mean NOTHING is special about Disney but it's a money grab!😡
I went there several years before Covid. I hated it. I felt like I had to leave my rights at the door. Then you’re standing there in crazy lines for every single ride and to get food. There was no seating when it was time to eat. The food wasn’t good. Prices sucked. It was honestly a very unpleasant experience and I don’t plan on going back.
*******Only Stupid People would give their money to Disney, it's the truth...deal with it!***********
Fox planted this guy to make news 😆 grocery and gasoline prices are not better they are sky high people that watch Fox news are being brainwashed😆🤣
1400 dollars for a day… I could never afford it. Even if I could I wouldn’t.
Oh come on ---- so much better than Disneyland.
3:05 daughters answer was so heart warming
“We’re all trying to pinch pennies.” 🤔
Then make more money … and stop blaming the other administration… Trump is causing more inflation and increased prices for groceries
The little girl just said the best part of Disney was waiting in the long lines so she could have time to just talk with her family. Makes me wonder if dad could have saved a bundle and just picked a more financially-sane, non-Disney activity to give his daughter what she really wanted: time to bond.
50% of Americans who go to Disney world get into debt. That’s just people having irresponsible spending habits 😅
If we boycott Disneyland,  then Disney will have to relent with their greed. That place should be emptier than than EuroDisney
F that I'm better off chilling at Orlando studios
Keep on re-making terrible versions of the classics.   I'm 50 now, but as us Gen X's, Millennials, etc... age out, who are going to show/pass down all of the beautiful nostalgic & classic Disney of yesteryear, inticining them to want to go.   Disney's days are numbered if the keep this mess up.  Terrible brand strategy!!!
To see ur kids smile is priceless. I knw its expensive but u aint gotta make ur kids feel bad about the money you spent.
Lmao. Definitely first world problems. If you get mad at dropping over 1k for a day in a known tourist trap, then you have to be the most clueless person I’ve ever met.
So her favorite part was waiting in line talking with her family- they could do that for free in their living room on a daily basis 😅😅😅
Disney is a lot of money, but it is a forever memory for ages 8 and up.  Bringing small children who will have no memory of the park, the rides, or the characters is in my opinion foolish.  I grew up in southern California so we went to Disneyland from 1960 on.  I was 5 or 6.  I have no recollection of any visits until the late 60s and 70s.  Bringing little ones is a waste of money as is bringing people who don't/can't ride the rides.  They still have to pay to get in.  An unnecessary expense. Present day..if i lived near a park an annual pass would make sense for the family. A big expense, but worth it if you have the time and people who love rides and the Disney experience. Our last visit was for Mickey's very merry Christmas. We got there at 4 pm and the park closed at 12 am. It was about half the price of a daytime ticket and 8 hours was enough time to ride everything.  There wasn't any crowds either so no long lines and waiting. Heck going to the movies with a family of 5 will cost a couple of hundred with tickets, food, drinks, candy and popcorn.  That only lasts 2 to 21/2 hours.  Disney is all day and into the night. An annual pass gets you free parking too.   Also, if you bring a lunch you can leave and reenter.  We picnic outside the park or do snacks in a backpack.  We also bring refillable water bottles.  We do hot dogs and fries not sit down restaurants.  We did a character meal ONCE several years ago..that was more than $400. The food sucked and the grandkids were afraid of the characters.  Never again.  Every store in Orlando sells Disney merch at a fraction of park prices.    Get him the light sabre at walmart.
In my humble opinion...you gotta be a pretty mindless person to like Disneyland. I personally cant stand it. Even if the prices went down...i still wouldn't go. Its just a waste of a day. Doing mindless things
Disneyland is falling apart, & many times the bast rides aren't even open...
Boycott Disney and any of their subsidiaries.
If you are stupid enough to go they are smart enough to take advantage of you.  He's probably a woke fool.
Incredible, Fox News found a way to sneak in “under the last administration...” in a segment about increased costs during a new administration that FOX refuses to mention, which is running our country’s economy into the ground. How long are you planning to hold that note? 2028??
If people stop going, maybe they’ll lower the prices but no matter what the price is the sheep keep going
If you can’t afford to go. Don’t go. Everyone knows the cost of services and goods has increased. Look for discounts if you want to save money. This story only exist because the riech hates Disney.
Um... a responsible adult would check the prices BEFORE going so they are not left in shock. Who doesn't already know Disney is a rip off? They charge those prices because people are still willing to pay for it. Supply and demand... and Disney has the demand because people are still willing to pay the prices.
I tapped out when you see the micky ears and sign for his YT channel...
Everyone knows Disney is for the well off folks.
And thats without Tarrifs kicking in..
Hail capitalism. Stop complaining.
WOW 😳
Rediculous price. Not worth it.
THIS is news??? How about the virus in Australia or the bird flu that is now in cows and humans?
Rip off
Then the Twerking Contest tickets were an additional $180.00.
Disney has always been a bad influence on children. I say this having grown up with it and not understand why my parents were hesitant to allow us to watch certain movies. Now as an adult, with my own children, and my own convictions, I understand. Disney movies promote children who misbehave and go against the better judgement of their parents. They teach children  to follow whatever whim sets on their heart instead of doing what is right in there's of our Lord. No thanks Disney.
How IGNORANT was this father?????
Disney is evil.
"Disney Magic" at "The Magic KINGDOM" = Making your Money Disappear while distracting everyone with their APP during your "Shake Down" while there.
Someone's got to pay for all those loser movies.
Flying wheels., dude he lives in jersey lol
I lived in south Miami from 85-91. Used to go to Disney world frequently. Mostly for Epcot. Disney had a pass for residents during slow months. Gave us picture 🆔 called, a three season salute, I think. May, January and February were the months. Sometimes they threw in September too. Go as many days as I wanted for those months. Whopping $77 total.  We'd take three day weekends and drive up there. Used to drink bourbon at The Rose and Crown bar, in Epcot center. We must have made an impression on the bartender Rose. She remembered our drinks. Like four, five months later.  Lots of days there, ther was no one in line ahead of us for any rides. Would even talk to employees for a while. It was a good time back then. Wouldn't go now if it was free
Disney was too expensive ten years ago, I will never go there again.
What does this 🤡 expect? It costs a lot to maintain a Property along with Food, Drinks and Souvenirs. Plus they have to pay their Employees, Suppliers and for the land and utilities. “They want us to never leave, I can’t afford anything, I’m a Small Business Owner.” NOT THEIR PROBLEM! They can’t help it when others are oblivious to how staying in Business works. I hate it when these Idiots cry wolf after doing something that they didn’t have to and then expect sympathy for it. Grow up, and how about stop exploiting your Daughter?
What a joke!
Cost for parking: $30.00 Cost for tickets: $974.00 Cost for cross-dressing guilt free...PRICELESS!
Disney has not seen a single penny from me since the dreaded 2020. They have gone way down hill. Disney is way over hyped not worth what they charge.
But I’m sure the kids had a lot of fun and they will never forget their trip to Disneyland. It’s just like Fox News to lie in over exaggerate the story
There are cheaper options - not Disney's fault you sucked it up
I see all these comments of people crappin on Disney but in the outside world all i see is a bunch of die hard Disney mouse lamp riders.
Welcome to the Woke-est and most expensive place on earth!
You want sticker shock, try paying for showing horses. We pay that much just to enter a few classes for a few minutes. Compared to that, Disney is a bargain, and you get to be doing something the entire day!
" HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH" 🌎 HUH  NAH 😂
This guy is starving for attention his YouTube channel sucks
Thats 😢😢😢😢😢 and wrong of Disney....who claims  to be for the family  and kids...they arent..😢
Im 66 my parents couldnt afford to take us to Disney in the 60's. or 70's,  So we went top the county fair.  Now i tell everyone
Let's not forget the other FUN stuff that makes the experience like snacks, that dry turkey leg, souvenirs & more especially COLD water while you wait.
My wife loved going to Disney despite what at the time seemed outrageous entrance charges a decade or two ago with the most popular rides having a wait of up to an hour or sometimes even more when brand new. We threw in the towel when Disney added their new grift: the  (per person) $30-40 surge estimated lightning pass (one ride) and premier $400 (all rides one time each) to effectively let you pay to line jump from the standard super long winding queue to a 5-10 minute line.
That's ok, they don't want your child there anymore, they like to engage in adult content, NOT family friendly.
If part of the partner program on Instagram, 1 mil views could net up to 10k. If he has 8 mil + views, as the program states, he will easily recoup the cost of his trip and make a huge profit.
If you want Disney parks merch but at a discount go to the character warehouse locations at the two outlet malls in Orlando. Its limited but much cheaper there!
Somebody has to pay for the Snow White flop.
The magic is gone
200 per person 50$ for parking
Disney is so stupid overprice
Pinching pennies to me is being frugal on necessities, not vacations.
California Disney 3:46 is more than that
Donald Gennaro: "We can charge whatever we want, 5,000 a day, 10,000 a day, and people will pay it."  Hammond: "Donald, Donald this park was not built to cater only for the super-rich; everyone in the world has the right to enjoy this place"
My daughters don’t even like Disney. Saved me tons pf money. They said the characters at the park looked creepy and scare to the crap out of them when they went to Disney Land at 6 years old
Stupid people with more money than brains pampering children that will grow up to hate them. LOL
Do you know what kind of TV and other goodies you could have bought for over $1,300 and it lasts for years. What did you actually get besides one meal, a parked car, and a few rides. Does Disney know what a dollars really worth the people? Do you know most of these people you're paying this money for are still WOKE TRASH. I think you can find a better place to spend your money. Oh yeah dude get the bow off your head.
The mouse is saying that If you have to ask the price, you should not be there.
NEVER AGAIN WILL I PARTICIPATE IN ANYTHING THATS ATTACHED TO DISNEY
I rather go to Wally World 🗺️ or to space X world one day 😢
That is just ridiculous, the average family can't even go to Disney parks anymore. SHUT disney down.
Saying he's trying to pinch pennies & going to Disney?? AND being a last minute day trip... He obviously has $$ to spare. Most families do not have $50 left to go to McDonald's
Disney is past its prime, I hate to say. Loved the Golden Years through Early Nineties. Now it’s woke, black/brown, pronouns, etc.
May I recommend to the dad and his sweet little brats, Pleasure island by the coachman? There are no rules and it's all free!  But maybe he'll have to check with the wife first because she wears the pants in the family and makes him sleep on the couch! 🤣  Come children, The coach departs at midnight!  Hi-diddle-dee-dee It's Pleasure Isle for me Where ev'ry day is a holiday And kids have nothing to do but play Hi-diddle-dee-doo If what I hear is true At noon each day, there's a big parade The river's flowing with lemonade A land of pudding and marmalade It's Pleasure Isle for me!   🤣
My daughters cheer team had a performance right before Christmas at the park. We paid out the butt even with a discount. We stayed at coral springs and it wasn't worth what we paid. Then we got the lightning passes and we couldn't even use them cuz u had to schedule it. Absolutely insane!! Disney should Absolutely be ashamed of how they do hard working families
It was expensive 38 years ago when I was there. Today I wouldn't waste the money. But Epcot was really cool and made it worth it. Rather go to Great America or a  Water Park.
Only woke Disney adults go there
I’m from Hawaii, went to Disney world and universal Studios spent $15,000  me,wife, and daughter flights hotel and ticket.. it’s crazy.. Disneyland for us would cost me $8,000.. come on Disney
What a simp.
Take your kids to National Parks, show them pure beauty.
Thank goodness I'm single. That bubbly interviewer totally negated the impact of the story : 'those prices are outrageous . . . Ashley, did you have fun?'
So don't take em to Disney, just stand in a line...priceless😂
Why would you dolts complain that a place you hate is too expensive?  Just don't go.  Not to mention the fact that you are a total moron if you pay full price at the window...
I haven’t been to Disney and I live in Tampa since 2005 and it was too expensive back then.
😂😂😂
🎶You're gonna have face it You've been fleeced by a mouse.🎶
Left or right, this is just sad. I remember going there TWICE when I was studying in Colorado in the 90s, and it’s sad that my kids will most probably not experience all the magic the place offers. It was a place that brought people of all ideals together.
No WAY would i pay this much!! And how can any regular family even afford this??!!
Why did you go?
Wow
That’s ridicules ,universal studios also
I don't support woke therefore I don't do Disneyland. You can tell the dad is borderline
Good on the little girl for her take on her favorite moments, just excited to spend time with her family, that’s priceless!
There’s a lot fruit cakes at Disneyland!!!
We spent $354 on two 4-day passes with Park Hopper in 2015. Our entire trip (flights, lodging, transportation, meals) totaled $1500.
Disney is the devil and not worth the price. Just look at how the Mickey Mouse club kids turn out. There’s something really wrong with that entity.
Well his daughter thought it was worth it lol...not doing her Dad any favors.
Sorry, but Disney is not worth that much money! I have no interest in Disney anything at this point.
What a scam....charge over $1,000 for 5 people but Disneyland is so crowded they can either stand in line ALL day or pay another $400 and actually ride the rides. That is embarrassing greed and not entertainment
Dude is a miser
Obviously hasn’t been part of any WDW Facebook groups.
Stop calling it Disney it died with Walt. RIP
That averages to about $275/ person for the park, plus snacks, drinks and two meals...  Maybe don't buy $12 beers and $50 entrees???  Bet he dropped over $2K on Taylor Swift tickets for the wife and kid without blinking.  His YouTube channel must need a bump so he went Anti-Mouse instead of pushing used cars.
Affordable Disney Word trips are a Constitutional right. Everybody knows that. Elect Trump to a third term so he can solve that problem as well.
Shesaid that most people cant afford it but as he said it was packed in the park. So when I go places and witness crowds i dont think people are suffering as much and the media and politicians exclaim.
Wonderful place on earth? More like Wonderful HELL ON EARTH!!
As a Canadian Disney Park fan...Disney continues to make it more and more difficult to justify the cost. Over the years, they've continued to remove, what was once complimentary, and nickle and diming so many other things...further souring the experience (Magical Express, Free Dining packages, etc). I've had some GREAT memories and experiences in the Parks, but these prices are just getting more and more out of control. While I haven't done the math...and WHO KNOWS when me and my family might visit Orlando again *given the current political climate and the CAD at a low point...when we visit again...we're actually more interested in trying out UNIVERSAL.
Mind blowing that Disney basically stays packed, with those prices. I went 20 years ago and was too young to remember the prices since I didn't pay for it, but I don't remember it being worth $1,400 for 1 day. That sounds like what we might've paid for the whole week.
It's a trans world after all, it's a trans world after all,,,,,,,,,,,
Amazing and beautiful place to visit but yea it’s crazy expensive there
I lived 15 minutes from Disneyland and would never go . Nothing but a big expense and lines. I don’t need the headache !
Hocico drowning  banned YT  video comes to mind 😅😂, called it 20 years ago
Despicable 😮
I will never go there ever.
Did he say we are all trying to pinch pennies? Dude, you just went to Disney lol😂
Helped me make a decision.....
Disney’s fun! But it’s not just Disney, most theme parks are expensive
Yeah, the costs are absurd!
One of the many reasons why I don’t take my family there anymore
Not only was the cost nearly $1400 for a family of 5 (for ONE day), but the lines for each ride are probably close to an hour if not more. Most people are lucky to ride the major attractions ONCE when they’re there.
I enjoyed going to Disneyland (Calif) as a kid and wanted to take my grandsons there, but both the wokeness and the cost are going to prevent that from ever happening. Sad, but it was Disney's choice - not mine.
I was there for epic universe, and I spent $3,500 dollars for 3 days for 2 people. I love all of Orlando but now the crowds makes everything no longer fun
Imagine how long the lines would be if it was affordable… sad to have to put it that way but it’s true. They do not care who gets or doesn’t get to go, as long as those profit numbers at the end of the year go 📈and not 📉
That's astronomical.  I'm sorry, but that's simply too much for one day.  And they're Florida residents, so coming from out of town would be even more expensive.    It's not reasonable, Disney.   You're going to continue to lose tourists unless you do something to make going to Disney more attractive from a cost standpoint.  Too bad.  You're taking Disney away from a generation of children, I guess.  Hope it's worth it to you.
What a scam everyone is trying to rip each other off another scam is rent! Disney sucks ( ITS A GREEDY WORLD AFTER ALL)!
Disney is woke! Don't waste your time or money there!
silly people go to disney, take the family to a national park, for a few days camping, swimming, hiking, watching the stars, cooking by a camp fire , being with your family !!
Am in Disney at the moment, brought my grandkids, 8 days with 4 days in parks cost 15,000$ flights hotels food, unreal.
Capitalism. No one forces you to take the brode to Disney
The dems changed generations of minds and hearts for the worse
Spend north of a grand, to stand in line all day. What fun.
Disney day trip for the rich
Ripoff
This was a DAY TRIP, not even an overnight in one of the hotels! Disney should be ashamed, but they never will be. Creating loving memories with family is no longer what they strive to provide. It's disgusting and sad.
Ripoff. No more Disney trips for me. I was born in Anaheim 62 yrs ago. Wearing the mouse hat seems like they still have him hook line and sinker?
It's unacceptable!! You all deserve more!
OMG!
Anything is only worth what people are willing to pay for it... and Disney knows that.
If you buy Disney your supporting their new woke agenda.
And all of this could have been avoided by him just saying "No"   no to the plastic toys at the park, no to all the treats you get (last time I went we packed our own snacks for my kid),  no to a nicer restaurant for food, and most importantly NO TO DISNEY WORLD.    Seriously, everyone knows this park is expensive AF,  people making videos about how it's still expensive are basically looking to go "viral" and get the clicks... just like this guy.   Do something else with the family, you're the parent,  act like one.
Disney is a scam ! ,  and and they arrest pedos (workers) every yr and  not 1  like 10 plus ! If you’re an adult and love this place chances are you’re a weirdo. JS
Don’t complain about the expense when you fell for the hype hook, line and sinker. If you can afford it, just do what you want. Mwhile, for us cheapskates we go to the national parks and beaches. No lines. And if you go in the off season, no crowds, too. But ofc, it isn’t for everybody.
Going to DisneyWorld is an elective expense, Dad. Get your cards greased up, zip your lips, and enjoy!
Walt is rolling in his grave, so sad.
Her answer at the end proves you absolutely don't need a Disney vacation.  There are much better ways to spend $1400 together as a family.
The last time I went to Disney was in the summer of 1978.  This makes me not regret ever going back.
That's why we don't go and haven't been there in over 20 years, and we are Florida residents!
BOYCOTT DISNEY NOW... WHY SUPPORT THIS WOKE LIBERAL IDEOLOGY...
Hahahahhahaa i thought this was an Onion article 😂😂😂
Disneyland is way overcrowded. I suspect the bean counters solution is to keep jacking up the prices until they get the parks thinned out some. It will eventually become a rich people only venue. Just how they like it, insulated from the peasants.
Only WOKE would expect “free” everything?  The overhead & maintenance is staggering, get a clue!
You wasted money at Disney? What a fool.
Get another job. That's the answer to everything in this country. If it costs a lot, don't be pointing fingers at price gouging, it's the American way to rip people off. Get another job and stop whining.
You could spend a weekend out somewhere scenic, do something memorable, maybe teach your kids some history and have some Christmas money left over for that
Sorry but you deserve to pay every cent, without bitching about it! Not sure if you’re just trolling. Smart adults would’ve did price shopping before they did this! I stopped going to Disney over 20 years ago cause of 50% price increase in three years, extremely high prices on food and souvenirs and long, long lines on every ride- rides that have never been updated since I started going in the early 70’s in college. Do not feel any remorse for how you got ripped off.
Trying to remember when I started boycotting Sleazy 🤔... '03? Pure satanic evil.
GEEZ‼️ NO MORE MAGIC 🐭
Boycott Disney
WHATS WITH THE STUPID MM HAT, MAKES YA LOOK LIKE A PERSON TO BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF !!  best of luck mate !!
Pay up for consumerism lol They better see your money next summer too 🤡
Expensive and crowded
Isanity
The only magic at Disney is empty bank account.
Disney is for the rich jerks only.
I just can’t believe that Disney has to charge that much money to keep the parks up and running!  It’s a scam and they use kids to guilt parents into spending their money.  Shameful!
IMO - It does not interest me whatsoever. It has turned into a tourist trap.
Disney tries to out price one day families.
The last time I visited the Disneyland resort in California was Thanksgiving 2019. The ticket I brought was $225. I spent $50 on parking. I only had one meal each day, so that adds up to another $40. I spent $35 on one shirt. All together, I believe I spent around $380 just to cover myself. To top it off after the trip, my bank account stayed negative for a month.
You’re lucky they didn’t turn your daughter into a boy with some propaganda while you were there. Think of what that would’ve cost.
HIS MISTAKE,  EVERYONE KNOWS THE DEAL WITH DISNEY $$$$$..EVEN THE GUY HIMSELF BEFORE HE WENT, NOT SURPRISED !!
Could went to Paris
The power of suggestion can't be ignored. That's how the saying goes. Because fools and all their money makes fun world go round...
Next time go to Branson!!  Family friendly and cheaper
Epcot center. Went in at 9 am and left at closing. Rode 3 rides with lightning pass. Waited 2.5 hrs in for dome coaster and it was the worst ride ever. I'm like why are we waiting for this.   Tron cycle ride had appointments slots that when you reserve, you end waiting 3 hrs for a ride you reserved a time slot.   I waited another 3 hrs for that one
Disney langd is overrated. Take your kids to other countries and let them experience new cultures, natural wonders of the world instead
It's to keep the riff raff out.  Otherwise your experience there would be worse.
1500 divided by 5 is 300 right? That's not that bad for a single day trip for one person 300!!!
i didnt know this world still had cave dwellers.
Ya? I can’t afford the have the Eagles play my Birthday! 🙄
Just go to universal they have new rides and new everything and it's cheaper than this.
He said the magic words....She ask if it was worth it? And he said yea so.....
Yeah, well, you literally bought the hype.
At these prices, and mind you, a ball game is not much cheaper either, it actually pays to purchase a yacht in the mid thirties or so lengthwise, on a per trip cost, and do some family cruising. And with the yacht, there are no lines to wait on, no traffic jams, no long car rides, and many activities you can only do on a yacht. If it is a sailing yacht, the fuel cost is near zero. You can see wildlife most people can only see through glass or on TV. And you can experience locations that are only accessible from the water. If used three weekends out of every month for five months a year, the yacht will pay for itself in a few years. The skills learned will last the kids a lifetime. What used to be family entertainment has been priced out of reach for most people.
Many years ago I was on the “It’s a small world” ride line in Disneyland. A 6 or 7 year old boy in line behind me tried to lift my wallet out of my back pocket while we were waiting on line. When I caught him, his parents yelled at him “we told you not to do that here!” It seems like everyone wants your money at the Disney parks, especially Disney! (Happily, I never returned to any Disney park).
because they gave huge pay hikes to all the illegal nonenglish speaking kids they hire. we get in for free n still wont go!
He made that video for views.  I'm sure 8 million views paid for that day at DW.
Apparently it's cheaper to go to Paris and Tokyo for Disneyland..... And Disneyland in California, not surprisingly, is the most expensive of them all... I remember my husband and I going as sort of like a honeymoon in October of 99 to Disneyland, Anaheim. And our entire trip with 3 day passes was less than a thousand dollars..... Sad. Because it's not worth it...
lol I hate Disney with there woke crap and high prices and there new lame movies! I never have wanted to go honestly I never like mikeymouse that much. When I was a kid my dad offered to take me to Disney I refused to go he got mad eventually he accepted I wasn’t going with the family 100% no lie I hope they go bankrupt especially after they ruined starwars!
Not meant to casually pull in every Saturday. Takes planning and it’s once every several years. It’s always been more than garbage parks because what they have is superior in every way. I don’t mind paying for a magnificent experience every time I go. Stay deluxe, and spend, and have a ball!!!
Disney definitely has to work on their lines for each ride, you wait too long
High prices keep the riff raff out, ! So cannot go see Mickey!  Long lines to rides wastes a lot of precious time. Seems like Disney never wants to limit the amount of people in the park. Can get REALLY  crowded! You may be able to only go on 4-5 rides per day.
lol I hate Disney with there woke crap and high prices and there new lame movies! I never have wanted to go honestly I never like mikeymouse that much.

I live down the street and save myself the money and headache and never go.
And that’s on the cheap end… Disneyland resorts, is way more expensive
… Go Woke, Go Broke! 🔥💰🏰💰🔥
Why are you going to Disney at All if should only buy 2 dolls instead of 20?
Did Disney as an adult in 2017. Glad I went then, because I sure as he££ am NOT going back!!! Plenty of nicer places to go and spend that kind of money!!! But glad they had a good time with their family!
Dolts.
Been to universal studios in Florida twice I dropped a pretty penny 🫴 🪙
MORALE of this story (nothing new under the sun): TALK MORE = SPEND LESS $$$. These def less expensive or free alternatives. Kids really just want/need to spend time really engaging with F&Fs!
They have kept raising the prices all while taking things that used to be included with an all inclusive trip. They are also taking away all the Walt Disney designed Rides, Lands and Shows. These woke, liberal leftist, radical Activists running Disney think they created all of this! Well they didn’t, Walt Disney did!
Wow, not a planned trip and was still able to swipe with no issues 😂 I certainly wouldn’t have chose Disney of all places🤮
Walt would be turning in his grave! This is what happens when the bean counters take over! 🙄
People can't afford grocery things got better 🤦🤷? GIT WORSE!!!
200 per person, You are going to spend dough no matter where you go.
I Never do anything Disney!!
Have been looking at taking my 4 year old granddaughter with her mom and dad for just one day. Hotel and tickets are almost $2500.That is INSANE.
And ALL those toys are made in communist China that they make for pennies on the dollar.
youtube influencer.....🤨
Kendall👧 is someone to be very proud of, 👏a mature and loving❤ insight🧐 for a young lady! 👧 Excellent Job Mom & Dad 💯🥇💑~
Dont waste your money in Disney
Everything they paid for, I got a 6-day, 7-night package including Universal Studios and Disney, as well as Nickelodeon Studios, in 1993.
I'm in San Diego. When my son was born 23 years ago, we bought a yearly pass for Disneyland In Anaheim. We paid over 600.00 but we used the passes regularly and every coupon imaginable. We have never been since. A friend took his girlfriend last year and it was 2 thousand for two days for both parks. He could have gone on a cruise instead. Just an incredible rip off.
There’s nothing “family friendly” about an amusement park that has princesses with facial hair, a deep voice, and a bulge between the legs. Disney has to charge more at their parks because their woke movies keep losing millions of dollars at the box office. If you’re buying tickets for Disney’s entertainment, then you are funding their DIE and LGBTQ programs and agenda.
All this wining 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
he is a youtuber not ur daily average joe
Whatever happened to accountability conservatives?? I didn’t see Mickey threatening him to spend the money lmfaoooooo. Clowns.
Let’s face it everything’s a rip off.
I took my son and his two daughters and his wife to Disneyland in 2022. The whole thing cost me $1,700 and it was just for one day. It was a joke you had to do the time ride thing. I mean it's a nightmare now I will never go back
You couldn’t give me a free trip to any Disney park location, little alone me hand over my hard earned money 🤦🏼‍♀️😂
Is anyone really surprised???
It makes you wonder if the lines are so long so that you DO buy the "Lightning pass".
Ridiculous. Would rather spend my money elsewhere.
And yet the parks are packed
Well, I want to see all his receipts.  I am sure he bought them everything they asked for.  I go to Cedar Point, we buy nothing.  We ride rides and I get the unlimited drinks.  I don't buy into all that extra crap.
How is this news?
Follow your heart is the basic premise of most Disney movies.… even if it means going against those who are older and wiser. Sounds Satanic to me.
they don't have enough money to pay me to go there
Why is this even on the news? My tap back in 2019 trip to Disney qas over $1200 for my family of 4. Nothing new. Disney have been expensive since forever.
After all that, the daughter just liked spending time and talking in the lines. Like Christmas Day…getting all the toys but let’s play with the boxes.
YEARS ago, my cousin took her three kids to disney and for a full weekend staying in the park, she spent nearly $6,000.00. she never EVER took them again.
Disney E ticket means something completely different today
Thats Craig from Flying wheels,he always buys expensive cars and merch.
Who goes to disney????????😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Walt Disney must be rolling in his grave.
Wait until those tariffs hit.. Keep Spending that money MAGA.. 😆
It is disgusting.  Yet, people will still go and still pay.  Just like it baffles my mind that people are still buying houses despite the cost going up on average about 1/3.  A $180,000 home is now $300,000.  Because people are idiots.  They want want want and don't think of the future.  It is like these college adults that blindly sign for their school loans and don't think twice what they will have to pay back.
Have less kids fool lol me and the lady go for 100/ day each for the ticket and spend what we want where we want lol no worries
Honestly looking back as a child I can't remember having that much fun at Disneyland Six Flags Magic Mountain was way funner the rides were more fun Mickey Mouse is sort of a kids theme and if you're into the entertainment and all that stuff I guess yeah but if you're down for just rides and having fun the Six Flags are better than that at least you're getting your money's worth in xhilaration
Disney is dead
not worth it.... too outdated sad and pathetic
Try Dollywood instead
Disney wants you to have fewer children...
The last time I went was before 2020 and I have been a couple of times when my kids were young in the 80s and 90s. It was expensive then but now, it's liberal and way too expensive for families so I don't have a desire to go back. My daughter could have taken her kids to Disney World in Florida but she choose Dollywood instead.
We went last year with 4 people for 4 nights 5 days. We spent 2 at Disney and 2 at Epcot. We stayed at a Disney resort. It was a little over $10,000 and that doesn’t include airfare from Kansas City. We go about every 3 years and it’s definitely getting more expensive!
Sad that he had to spend soo much just to get a day together. Shows how much the family unit does NOT spent time together anymore. 😢
They have always been overpriced.
Should've went to universal studios theme park
No toys at Disney are worth it! First, all made in China with lead and who knows what else! It’s a rip off!
I would NEVER spend that on a  one da event, let alone on scummy Disney.   That's more than I used to make working a whole month.
That’s flying wheels Craig
Disney has become a joke of what it formerly was. Walt would keep spinning in his grave if he could see how they completely destroyed his work and effort.
$1,400.00 is not bad for a family of five. I spend that on airline tickets. Like my 10 year old tells me, “Be thankful that you have the money to spend.”. He really brightens up my day.🙄Hope this helps.🤗
No sympathy for this dude. A fool and his money are soon parted
We Americans are the only people who will pay outrageous prices to stand in line all day and then complain about it. SMH
No difference at the ball park, concerts, broadway shows, fine dining, opera, all the places Trumpers never heard of.
All you had to do was say NO
Surprising yet beautiful answer 💜
It's quite the rip-off, and it supports ped0phili@   many years ago, before we knew how wicked Disney was, we walked in without paying a cent, because we were military.
That’s noooothinh! Try Disneyland! 😂
Disney is pure crap!  Ditch it.
He's not the only one i went last sat family 5. $1350+300(food)+$35 (parking) Kids 1st time I'm ca native, remember my wife 1st dated it was less $100 for season pass w/ parking.
Wow! Insane.
Cuz Disney sold out to China 🤣
lol okay…point of this is…? Yeah, WDW is expensive…that’s not news.
Not bad, some of the rooms are that much per night 😅
Always on Dad's Dollar
I boycott disney...how sad how much it costs....greedy...should be cheaper ..
That ending tho 😢
So don’t go.  No one made you. Americans are some whiny babies.
How convenient on Fox News with his YouTube channel t-shirt on, sign and subscriber plaque behind him. How many subscribers will this generate so he take his family back?
Last summer I took my family of 5 to Universal Studios Hollywood for 1 day.  I think the tickets were about $1,900 with the front of the line pass and early entry to Mario Land
Is Disney of course is expensive...
And they only ate at one place that's not talking about other stuff to drink and games to play and buying souvenirs it's going to be like four or five thousand dollars that's insane
I can't imagine there property taxes and Ins....  thats why landlords have to raise rental price too.
Trump supporters don't want to go and spend any money when they can get free movies in their Trailor Park.
Only idiots pay those prices!  Don't be an idiot and the prices will drop.
Thanks for sharing the cost.
My dad would crap his pants. He took us in 1963 and I'm sure it was less than $50. total.
You mo ron  taking your kids to that rat hole. No compassion
Disney forgot about families
Single-day pass to Magic Kingdom is $119 each for ages 10+ so if he spent $974 on five tickets, he didn't get basic tickets. $30 to park at an amusement park is fairly standard. Dinner at a tourist resort restaurant at $50 per person is high of course but about what you'd expect, I think. Sit down service not a concession stand.  Also, this "small business owner" is a content creator as proven by the YouTube award behind him in the interview.  Disney is expensive...yes.  This guy wasn't the example to demonstrate the point.
A cruise for a week, or a day at Disney.     Hmmmm.
$1,400 for a day at Disney sounds high but it's not just Disney.  Eating out, service fees, server fees, all the other fees and out of control tipping culture is just as bad.  Pretty much anywhere you go inflation is out of control.  Late stage capitalism typically means major industries are populated with monopolies which contributes to the pain.  And the Fed printing money doesn't help.  Disney isn't cheap but we need to do this analysis on every experience.
I remember Disneyland ticket books were 24.00 then they went up to 27.50, now ? gasp 😮
Just think about how much money ,He should have just brought his daughter all kind of things from somewhere else, I'm sure she's would be happy with that, Disney Woke crazy crap
Going to Disneyland as a kid  (in the 50s) was 1 of the greatest memories of my young life. I really feel bad that because of the cost a lot of kids will never have that
Didn't the dad research prices before going.  He knows people say it's expensive. Theres information online.
And we are complying why? The cost of entertainment will only be as high as the market will bear. Economics 101. If you can't afford it don't go. 280.00 per guest for a day trip is not out of line with todays economy.
Universal is the only one that is somewhat reasonable
No no ma'am why did you try to slide in that half truth. "when we do these stories about how people can't afford groceries or gasoline... or at least that was under the last administration..." 2:15-2:23 You really just used this family's story to try to prop up Trump...and deflect from his Tarriffs. If you're mad at Disney for their prices, you must be ready to Take down Apple over theirs. Their day trip for 5 to Disney cost $1,400 but 1 of the new Iphones costs $1,500. (and up) So why is that capitalism is good and there's nothing wrong with it when it's Iphone, but when it's Disney...it's a tragedy? IF you are So Worried about these families that "Can't afford groceries or gasoline," Then why does your network spend all day and night kowtowing and excusing Trump who is making it even harder with Ego Driven Tarrifs, Stupid policies, Wasteful spending, and trying to take away safety nets for Americans, THAT THEY PAID FOR ALREADY? You literally had some Billionaire on here trying to convince people that if Social Security went away it would be fine for his mother-in-law. NO DUH!? You were the same ones broacasting LT. Gov of Texas's *BULL$hit logic* of Sacrificing our grandparents and older family members "for the economy," and capitalism...BUT NOW, ALL Of A Sudden...You Care?!?
the best part was waiting in line spending time with family!  That says a lot!  We all spend way too much time on our phones and social media and not enough time with our families or with our kids!
Most families don't want to go to Disney because of the total WOKE tragedy. R.
Disney is a scam!
I was there this weekend and honestly it was extremely worn down. Magic kingdom at that. There have been 0 renovations since I was a child.
Disneyland trip is like not even fathomable for 98% of American families. You literally need a hoard of "generational" wealth to go blow it on a vacation. Have you, Disneyworld Orland was incredible. It is a "value" to experience so much joy and happiness on earth with your family and share all those timeless memories watching your babies smile and laugh seeing what love and light can bring into our ever so cold and dismal world. This conversation should be a "canary" in a coal mine for "middle" America. Ask yourself, do you have $20,000.00 of disposable income to just blow up on a 5 day 4 night trip to Disneyworld? Think about it.
Dad do yourself a favor 🎉  Men don't wear Minnie mouse 😮  Still a great Dad❤
They got to make up for the Snow White disaster😂
I rather go to Dollywood or six flags , they charge less than a quarter of what Disney is charging
I remember buying annual passes for my kids  for many years .the premium pass at 389.00 then to 669.00 with no blockout dates parking included and discounts at restaurants and stores at the Anaheim park .But the same pass is now 1789.00 per pass with blockout dates and reservations needed . Why?? Corporate greed
👍🏿# 3.5k+ If it costs too much, then don't go. 👎🏿
Mean while supporting pedos.
Even if u give me tickets for free I wouldn’t step close
I wouldn't spend that much for a weekend. There are too many things that families need. Can't afford, and not willing to afford are two different things.
Disney, the corporate god of the leftwing has destroyed the ability of the common worker to enjoy a day at their park. Disney is now the playground of the elite.
Too much no thanks not going to the US for now. Take care from Canada 🇨🇦
Disney anyone 😂😂😂😂😂  Trump parade❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
They should cut DisneyWorlds CEO Bob Iger annual salary of 41 million so more people could afford tickets.
Trump's base can't afford it for they are uneducated and can't get a job.
Ive never been to Disney and never wanted to. I was visiting family in California back when i was a kid and we went to Universal Studios Hollywood and I saw the Walk of Fame.
It's basically theft at this point. We will not go there not only because of the absurd cost but because of the woke ridiculousness!
A little research would have revealed all of this.  Disney is the worst bottomless pit of greed on earth. They have released a string of films in the last few years that were all bombs at the box office.  They have to make it up somehow so they hit the consumer in the wallet who's fool enough to go to these parks.
Sure Disney is expensive. So is Universal Studios, Sea World, Busch Gardens, etc. Let’s hear from the so called price experts, what should it cost since everyone who criticizes Disney knows what takes to run the company in 2025?
To be fair "Disney" means 'family cash grab' in Swahili
While they pay the people in poor countries pennies a day to make their crappy souvenirs. Disney is dark, greedy, and instills nothing of importance to anyone.
If I’m going to spend almost $2000 on a trip, I’m going to Universal Studios
Even at that price disney is still overpacked. Why would they lower it and not price up.
Congratulations, flying wheels. Great channel 👏
Everything there is made in China so it is Trump's tariffs that make it expensive. Get used to it.
wow you got to spend time with your family, lucky
All these brokies complaining about the same thing. Is it expensive or do you just not make enough money. Change the lens you view the world in
Why are you going to Disneyland? I can understand the curiousity if you've never been but I recally getting bored, frustrated and disappointed at Disneyland in LA in the late 60s as a kid ... because everything was FAKE. Take them to ANY national or state park for twice the experience.
The Republicans, Fox and Trump should love Disney for it is all fantasy
Well when you go to a place that hires pedos and gays. You should be robbed cause you are a fkn idiot.
Nobody should ever go to anything with Disney Woke crap.
See the kid gets it best part was being around family and getting to talk to them . The best things in life are free AF!!! Glass is half full all day!
$1400/5 is $280 per person for the day. It's about the same for an NFL game.
How about get these kids some bikes, hit the beach … come on
Wait. So you pay just to get in then pay for rides separately??
I never want to go to Disneyland again. Iv been there 50 time's. I'm done 😊
oh no! it has gotten worse under this admin. are you kidding me!
Bet those Mickey ears set Dad back $40.00!
Absurdly overpriced
People finding out that they're one of us poor people will never not be entertaining.  Nor will all the people vehemently clinging onto the notion that _they're_ not.
Just get 2 dolls for Xmass instead of 20
Hey Craig, Been one of your subs on Flying Wheels for years.  Love your show, Man!  The one where you and your Dad go pick up your new C8 was awesome!  Haven’t been to Disney in ~ 20 years and won’t go back.  That’s like going woke and broke in the same day.  😂
I've never spent one dime at Disney and never will....that is robbery and they know it. Gotta support all those rainbow workers.
Nevermind ,,,stay cation it is ..
Zero people told you to go. If you don't want to spend the money don't go.
I love how she has to slip in about the former administration and make this political ... Stupid Fox!
Ridiculous,  Stop going.
The Powerpuff Girls are awesome. It’s one of my favorite. Cartoon Network shows next to samurai Jack.
Don't pay for parking. Pay for public transport. Don't buy food IN the park, unless it's really worth it. Eat off park restaurants.  Don't buy Fastpass if you can afford to wait instead
No loss if you don’t spend anything and don’t go. Downer all around.  Being with family standing in a line is the best part?!? Get a clue Dad.
We won't go to Disney any more,for the wife and our 2 grandkids it's about 1500 dollars a day.we have said enough.and then you have to think about your money going towards Disney's some liberal agendas,
make a Disney in each city, just make a private-public joint venture and kick out the undesirables from a particular city square limitation and you can be with your family as happy as Disney, in autonomous zones
Do we not do research before we go to amusement parks, especially spur of the moment. Don't get me wrong, that is a lot of money. But everyone knows amusement parks and their amenities are very expensive.
they should charge republicans double for all the attacks over the years.
Bro, look like VP, JD Vance
I still have my tickets from 1980. A two day pass was $19.97 and parking was 50 cents. Of course, there were fewer rides and activities, but it was great fun for little money!
It's just like living in California. People complain about how high the cost of living is there but they keep moving there and pay the high prices which only keeps driving the price even further higher
Art by Neimad
why would anyone go to a disney theme park? i guess they enjoy spending way too much and standing in line for hours.
Why are there no baritones or basses anymore? All I hear is tenors and higher.
I want to take a trip there in two years. I never been there. One day ! Wow
One of the reasons I won’t go back to Disney
It's people like him whose fault it is that Disney is still surviving financially. 🤬
Boycott vegas, disney and all eyegouging places 😢  😮
Lines? I thought Disney said they're getting rid of lines.
Greed Hello!!!! Greed.
I'd rather have a root canal than go to Disneyland
Disneyland has the same super high prices 😮
No sympathy. They still chose to donate the money to Disney😂
3 days at Disneyland in Anaheim with no park hopper tickets for our family of 5 cost atleast $6,000 when we went.
I hope they learn from vegas don't outprice yourself and put tourists in jail
In order to stay away from the "undesirables" you have to pay for it.
Outah their fn minds !
Disney is trash. The more popular it’s become the worst the food is getting! This shows the more money the make the more the quality goes down. I think Disney is an institution that will crumble in this new world.
absurd
What did he expect?
Usual suspect always crying about something
Stop going
I went to Disney with my 2 sons in 1997.  $4000.00 for  3 Days when I was a Florida resident.  The Most EXPENSIVE Vacation I have ever had  with my son's. AND  Again I was a Florida Resident. NEVER AGAIN. The Cost of Disney now is OUTRAGEOUS.   Believe me, I  understand.   All of the other Vacations I went on were Not even Close to the Disney Prices.  And I went to Alot of Great places.   And Not a Florida resident anymore. Left Florida 15 years ago. Don't miss it. My son's are grown Men now.  They also will Not go to Disney.  Sad. And a Shame. 😮
LOL people like him ruin the market!!--- if you wouldnt be willing to pay, they wouldnt charge outrageous prices $1.5k is not pinching penny buddy, we do Day Passes at Water Park Resorts now-- better value, and same opulent experience
You forgot to say that you only went on four  rides the whole day
Why even support WOKE Disney anymore? But then, the choice of ears, the dad's wearing, should answer that question.
I went a few years after it opened when I was in the Navy. I think it was $15 to get in and free to park. I was making about $4k a year
Little girl, what was the best part?  That daddy was paying for it...
It’s sad what has become of Disney word 😢
Our final trip to CA Disneyland was 1994.   Still not sure how families can do this.
So much better way to spend your money. Can't believe people actually go to these places.
When these kids are in college, and eating Ramen noodles many times a week, I hope they remember just how much this Disney trip cost.
I mean that technically comes out to $280 per person for parking, entry to the park, plus food and drink for the day. Yeah is $1400 a lot of money? Sure. But $280 per person isn't that bad
Once I saw a bearded dude in a dress waving little girls into the Princess dress shop all hope was lost. Evil company now. Walt is rolling over in his grave 😢
I have never been to Disney. no appeal
The Disney company sold its “soul” decades ago. Their cast members certainly aren’t seeing an acceptable amount of the money being raked in.
Disney doesn't care just give me your money.. Suckers
ripping off parents. it's a shame
Back in 1980, a one-day ticket was less than $10..
I will never go to Disney because of the ridiculous cost and their woke policy b.s.
Ca just as bad! Ridiculous!
if you are wanting to pinch pennies then you should have invested in a couple of condoms.😂
Kids.  You can either go to college or we can go to DisneyWorld.
Save your money people it’s not worth it!
It’s too much money. Disney is greedy. They are a multi billion dollar company. Surely they can afford to cut executive pay so that more people can go.
I live down the street from Disneyland in Anaheim and it would still cost me like 800 dollars for two people per day on the cheap end and this is also factoring in that I wouldn't need a hotel or flight since I live close. A beer is like 20 dollars at California adventure
QQ.  lines were long, complain over time or cost, i cant afford so w/e
Thats terrible
Is this the same guy who posted a video 2 years ago on CNBC titled "How I built my $3 million business buying cars at auctions" I think so.
disney needs to go away
Let me guess. The dude thinks the executives in charge at Disney care about anything other than fleecing people? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
What I can't understand is how that place can be so packed when it's that outrageously expensive.
universal too
Flying Wheels, nice!
Can anyone recommend more affordable theme parks in Florida??
Somebody has to pay for DISNEY'S LAW SUITS. And that's you the public. Don't go. Not worth it.
Disgusting. I’ll probably stop watching Disney movies.
Last time I went on a trip to disney in 2020 it cost me $9722.00 for a week. 2 adults 2 children. We went to Hawaii for a month for $5264.00, Florida Panama city Beach for a month $4789.00. No more Disney "Woke" crap for us.
Disney is a destination. If you can’t afford it don’t go. We have a trip planned in Nov for our family of 6 and their significant others. It’ll be worth every penny.
THIS is "news"?
Spent no time with family just made videos for the internet the whole time way to go dad
A Kings ransom!
The lady said it got better what a liar but thats fox nothing but bs
It is a choice.
No thank you!
If you're spending that kind of money in the first place why are you complaining?
Another Target to bring THIS country down...not planning on  Disney trips no More 6flags bound . Jus down do for an the COASTERS 😂❤
Most families can't afford it... OK, no problem, then DON'T GO... Enjoy a day at the beach, go hiking, or dog park. Let us people who can afford it go and enjoy smaller lines. Sheeesh peasants.
Bunch of broke azz whiners in here. Whaah, waahh, wahh..... cry more you're the ones who had the kids you can barely afford. Just because you can't afford it does not mean it's too expensive...it just means it is too expensive for you. By the way it costs $20 per person just to go to a simple movie. If you spent $1000 on a Disney trip as compared to a simple movie for 2 with popcorn and drinks would be about %10 of the price of the Disney trip @ $80.00.  Welcome to the modern world.
ALL OF THESE PARKS MILK EVERYONE!!!  Stop 🛑 GOING!
how much does it cost to go to the Movies? 5 tickets 60.00 dollars. 2 popcorns and 5 sodas and some candies. another 60 dollars.
Family  friendly?
Stop asking the kid about the cost.  She doesn’t care about his whining and had a good time.
looks like Ron Desantis's brother
$1000 to get in, well that sounds like a fun day. Everything woke turns to sh*t.
There movies sucks and are losing billions so they have to gouge somebody to recoup.
Having a family isn’t cheap.  Everything is expensive now and our leaders are doing nothing about it
yall complain about the cost but the park is still packed.
Despise Disney.
It's a small world but a gigantic rip off.
STOP GOING!
We won’t even set foot back at disney springs. $18 for a small burger that’s no better than what we grill at home!!! Nothing we ate at DS was worth what was (OVER)charged!!! HONESTLY!!!!!
This is some shock?   Go on any vacation with your family and it’s going to cost thousands.  How do you go on a trip and not plan what it will cost?
“Under the last administration?”  Wow!
don't worry,. thing will only get more expensive.
Disney sucks
Someone doesn’t know how to be in a budget and those ears say a lot
Who the heck would go to disney
The last time I was at Disney was over 45 years ago and thanks to an uncle that was a manager in Eastern Airlines ( Official Airline of Disney World) marketing dept he used to give me boxes of the ticket books.  Back then there were A,B, C,D,E tickets depending on the coolness of the attraction. Space Mountain was a biggie needing the E ticket.
hahahahahahaha
Not the onion.
I stopped going to Disney in 2019. The kids will have fun but the value for the experience is terrible. I just visited Epic Universe during the previews and spent $552 for my family of four to be in the park. Spent $300 for the Mario Land Power bands for us 4 and other things for the kids, plus $80 in food inside the park and another $100 in a restaurant nearby. That’s a little over $1000, but $300 were on souvenirs. Going to the Orlando theme parks is super expensive, but Disney is on a different league, just plain greedy for not a great experience. I feel bad that the kids didn’t get the lightsaber, but loved the little girl answer of enjoying time with family during the long lines. Great kiddo, great parents!!
FJB and Disney
Universal studios same way $$ no water fountains ANYWHERE a  small 10z drink was around $7 back in early 2000 ( don't know how much now)
Ripoff
And you wonder why tourists are avoiding travel to the US and Disney related stuff.
Well, don't go!
Now with Trump’s wonderful tariffs no one will be able to afford a trip to Disney not to mention being able to afford necessities like groceries. 😢
Woke disney movie big money
I wouldn’t go to Disney if they paid me
Idiots
$1,400.00 🏕️
975 bucks for five? And three were kids.  What a freaking joke, food being 245 dollars for a family of 5 is not crazy anymore but it’s still insane. 30 bucks for parking, couldn’t even imagine how much a beer is in the park.
Woke disney need money
Not counting souvenir $$ and drinks somewhere in the day $$$
Why would he be shocked. Doesn't he listen or read the news. Mickey World is for elites. Keep making those shareholders happy.
Just save your money and go to universal people, Disney is a scam, they only care about money.
200 dollars for tickets?? For the day??  In 1990, they were 31 dollars...
I am smart enough to know that Disney not worth any amount of money. They are garbage as far as I am concerned.
I’m glad we took our kids to Disney when they were young, in 2007, so they’d at least have a chance to experience it. We got the park hopper and stayed a week and I think our total, including air fare, Disney hotel, park passes, and food was about $5k.  I had a great time but on our list of vacations the kids and my husband felt Disney was somewhere in the middle, even toward the bottom.
back in the day, my dad said Disney was much more worth going as the tickets were cheaper. Now my dad says Disney is a ripoff.
It cost less to go to a good strip club in Fort Lauderdale
That's more than my Mortgage!!!
Wait did that really say 44.99 for a plastic light saber?????? 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Noone has that kind of money Disney is a RIP OFF
The first time I went to Disney I was shocked (as a child) that it cost $100 to get our entire family in the park! Years later when I lived near one of the parks I learned that the best time to go was the off-season, when it was cooler and nowhere near as crowded. Today I wouldn’t go.
With the cost of living in Los Angeles Disney should be ashamed of itself on what they are charging.
5 people, about $1000 bucks...that makes it $200 per person. Got to go on 3 rides each person so  65.00 a ride and that doesn't include parking, food etc. 😳 ... definitely NOT WORTH IT!!
Over rated. Super pricey and the long lines are not worth it. Food and everything else is average !
I don't understand why he's sniveling,  he bought the tickets.  Walking away instead sends a better message especially if enough people did it.
It is a huge ripoff for a woke experience. Go to your local county fair instead.
seems kind of simple..go to disney or go somewhere else.  buy a new car or buy a used car.  buy a new house or buy an older home.  people need to stop crying about high prices.  everything is expensive and never getting cheaper.  so spend money or don’t.  no one cares, especially disney.
Worth every Penny!
Disney is about the memories.  If you focus on the money, you may ruin the day for your kids
I was part owner of an auto repair shop close to Disney. Disney employees had the oldest, most ratty cars. Any repair bill over $100 was soul crushing to these people. All the people you see working in the park are truly the working poor!
Imagine if Disney was priced like any other amusement park. Now imagine bigger  crowds and even longer lines.
I wouldn't go no more either too expensive better off  and cheaper in Virginia beach you will have better good time
WOWZERS OMGGGGG😮POOR DAD
Standing with your family. We could've done way better than that for much cheaper. So hint hint dad. She's probably saying she doesn't spend enough time with all of us. So skip the big fancy visits. And plan like a hiking, or canoeing, or a beach trip. Something Wheres theirs a change of scenery, and an activity. Kickball game, shell hunt, picnic, etc. Have a parents vs kids volleyball game, etc. all this brainstorming is giving me ideas for a date. I found a bike trail in a close area near by. Just by scrolling through something like a Google maps. Started at my location, and kind of pinched my way around the surrounding areas.
I have been to disney once many years ago......that is it. I cannot imagine how Walt would feel if he were still alive.
That's why I stopped going.  The final straw was the condition of the buildings, especially the ones on the side by space mountain.  They are kinda hidden & were in grave need of maintenance.
Is that inflation or is something else going on?
I blame the dude for paying the money….go to other places
Las  Vegas is the same way! A bottle of water is $10 in the Casinos. Food prices are very high! Service is down! Expensive!
Disney has always been expensive
Wow!  And I remember the old Disney ticket book where the "E" tickets were the first ones to go!  A family of four in the 60's wasn't even one-tenth what he paid!!
Why is he in shock, did he not not see the cost as he was signing for everything, that’s stupidity on his part.
Highway robbery. The entire Disney name and everything associated with it nowadays is nothing but shame.
First time I went to Disney it cost my parents $20 per person. I would rather take my kids to the beach and eat like royalty instead of spending that money on Disney
You can get a better magic experience on the street for $10
as a passholder its not bad. if u have to complain about the price dont go.
They guy got ripped off, made a video about it, but still wore his mouse ears.  I think he may have some other problems.
If you're too stupid to do it I don't feel sorry for you
I'm 50 years old I never had a chance to go when I was a kid cuz I was broke....... me and my wife went for the first time ever just last year August of 2024 and I'll never go back again...... I'm a master plumber making 500,000 a year and I own a small business but I'm not about to give it to some jackass that wants to rip people off and take advantage of little kids.... I'm keeping it respectful cuz this looks like a Family Channel but I would tell them where to go and I would be loud and clear about it too
The park is NOT packed.  It’s just that there’s so little to do at the parks now, that everyone is just wandering around looking for something to do, which then causes them to spend more money on Chinese goods and $4 bottles of filtered tap water.
It's a ripoff. Our family of four went there about 12 years ago, and it cost us more than a thousand dollars for the tickets and meals
He is lying about the price of single day tickets. For NON FLORIDA residents it’s $119 per day
I can’t even afford the thought of going.
Here is a thought.  DO NOT GO
For a day trip?
Trump was owned by a mouse hahahahaa....
Groceries and gasoline prices have not gotten better. My weekly staples have gone up 3.6% since Feb 1st.
My dad was in shock when we visited Disney in the 70s
All that money to stand in line.
So the richest country in the world according to Trump ,is whinning about the cost of a trip to Disney. Wake up folks ,everything is gonna cost way more because of Trumps stupid Tarrifs.  It's ok for billionaires like Trump and his billionaire buddies that he gave huge tax cuts to AGAIN.
Sooome people get in free
They are trying to pay for all the crappy movies they keep putting out.
this dildo drives ferraris and hummers . he is a high end car dealer that screwd people in N.H
Woke is expensive. All those failed movies that cost so much are pricey.
Absolutely crazy! Disney should be boycotted!
So this guy wasn't sharp enough to check the costs before he went, and now he's looking like a clown on TV? Fantastic.
Walt is spinning in his grave.
Obviously didn't do his due diligence before going? This has been reported years ago...lol
They BETTER NOT ever forget it..they CAN’T afford to ever GO again!!!
Rent a big houseboat on a nice lake for three days at that price. Get to know your family again.
Disney doesn't deserve our money. Bad movies, scamming us.
Walt Disney is flipping in his grave because of the insane prices.  I doubt he ever imagined it would come to this.
Boycott this disgusting corporation. Your children will thank you for it.
Virtual Disney World is always free!
Disney trying to keep the crowds down and limit rift raff. Too many people. It was be 10 times more crowded if tickets were cheap.
One day was $1,400? HOLY SH
So he’s a YouTuber who just does trips like they are spending their hard earned money but not they get more than enough income of 4 families put together make that make sense lol and he used his credit card ok when the country is going bankrupt Disneyland is thee last thing you should be spending money on
And they probably managed to only ride 6 rides. The lines are ridiculous even with lightning passes
No different than real estate in California, foreigners will pay the price so to hell with Americans
Disney has already gone out of business.  Sadly, they just don't know that yet.
1,400.00$ for about 200$ in value!?!
He's obviously promoting his YouTube channel, and he probably went crazy stupid on the prices just to get the shock value up for more clicks and views. People need to stop taking the bait. He has probably made it back and then some on all the views of his video. Capitalism is great.   Just remember the Socialist will sell you a book on why socialism is great.
Shiii I was able to get me and my girl Disney tickets with lightning lane came out to around $450 for 2 I spent around 160$ in food alone
That little girl and her amazing answer. I just liked waiting in line and talking with my family. Wow what an answer!
Ainsley, maybe you can write another children’s book on how to divorce your husband if he doesn’t make enough money to keep you happy like you did 3 times and the effect it has on your child. Hannity and yourself should get along just fine since you both did the same thing by screwing around on your spouse’s and broke each other’s marriage up.
1:38 - Of course the little girl will say it's worth it.  She ain't the one footing the bills!
Why would I give my money to Disney?
He’s a DOPE!!!
Just giving money to China!!!!
Zoos are my go to or museum's and a nice dinner 😊
Dang. When I drop cash like that it's usually rent.
Go to Cedar point in Beautiful Ohio much cheaper and no mouse
That girl 💩 on that interview jaja good for her on being honest though but I’m sure it’s not the message the dad was expecting he even said it lol
What a rip off.  Shame on Disney.  I grew up in California and use to go to Disneyland as a teenager.  Parking was free, a ticket book that included entrance to the park and several rides was around $5.
How many kiss go missing at Diseny every year?
The bastards will have to pay me ,to get me there.
they have made some good coin on this viral video
Somebody has to pay for all of those flopped woke Disney movies🙄
did you go on the RACHEL ZEGLER RIDE>?>?>?>?  i hear its really scary
I never took my kids to Disney and they grew up just fine. As long as people keep going don’t expect any changes, it’s a disgrace!
Parking should be free.
Thank God my kids are grown.  I hope to never enter Disney again for the rest of my life
Growing up, I had no desire to visit Disney.  Nor did my brothers or any of our friends.  Our folks took us to Nat'l Parks, camping, museums, we saw the country not a fairy tale.  Wouldn't change  thing.
It's not Disney I hate I hate florida. With their right-wing propaganda and no gun control
That's the thing. You have to pay for the fast passes now, and the lines are so long that you don't get more than ten rides in a day.
Buying your child a light saber for 44.99  it’s necessary, it will end up in a pile with all the other toys at home!
I still can’t believe people actually get loans for/to go vacation, omg! Is it really that bad? I thought you vacation because you got and can afford it
The Disney in California is just as bad. You pay an arm, leg and a B-hole to get to stand in line for hours for a 10-15 second ride. Not my idea of fun.
Not sure why this is news. Disney has been overpriced for years. People keep paying these prices though so who really is to blame?
He is too funny with that on his head.😂🤣🤣. Yes. He said he lived even close to the place.
Disney is creepy anyway. If in California go to Knott's Berry Farm!!
I would never go to the park again.  I can stand on most sidewalks for hours for free.
One of the biggest scams is the reservations requirement, even for AP and FL-AP holders. That allows Disney to regulate the guests and know how many guests, and therefore required CM levels, will be needed. As a FL-AP holder, one of the greatest perks is to be able to wake up one morning, look at your family and say: "hey, you wanna go to EPCOT/MK/DHS/AK today?" Now you have to hope you can get a ressie - and trust me, they actively limit the number of reservations they'll issue. They also play the "control the sheep game" regarding park-hopping. I bet you one thing. When Universal gets their new park up and running, I bet Disney starts noticing that their competitor is eating their lunch and some of these little "COVID practices" start fading into the background.
So the locals don't even get a discount.
There going to put themselves out of business
The daughter said it all, the best part of that expensive day was the waiting in the long lines hanging out with her family. Didn't need the artificial outrageously expensive propagandist capitalistic environment of Disney to do that. A free state park would have provided a better opportunity.
They can afford to lose billions on their sh%^&* movies
@2:24 typical FOX throwing in the political jab. And NO, things have not gotten better nor less expensive.
Dude get annual pass to save , lots of
Was a season pass holder for years… in 1999 my niece and her son and I went to Disneyland, stayed at the Disneyland hotel went to the parks for three days and spent $1200 total. My niece and I spent $200 one night and splurged for dinner at the Napa Rose. You’ll never see that price tag again.
Everyone should stop going see how they feel then when they lose a lot of money it's suppose to be a place for families to have fun not worry about the money part I don't ever go there
Never been, never will!  Family did Disneyland in the 70’s, I was so sick from rides, I still feel🤢 remembering, no desire to return.  His daughters answer…just go on a picnic & talk…save hundreds!
It's become a total joke.
It’s peanuts if you work in San Francisco. If you work in Florida, then you know what you are up against.
Disney will never, ever get a nickel of my money and no one else should give them money either.
Only weirdos and beta males go there
I know some people who went to Disney, they said never again 😮
SO STOP GOING.  DO SOMETHING OUTSIDE IN NATURE, THE WOODS, A LAKE, A HIKE.  MY FAMILY WENT CAMPING.  WHY?  BECAUSE IT'S CHEAP!!  MORE FUN TOO BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT AROUND TONS OF PEOPLE.  WE EXPLORED, WENT SWIMMING, AND JUST HAD FUN!  NO REGRETS!  CANCEL DISNEY
Don’t have 5 kids !!! Problem solved!!
I imagine six flags is the same, waiting in lines all day
lol, I love how she tried to squeeze in that it was so bad under the previous administration and it’s gotten better when everyone knows it has not gotten better under Trump and it’s only getting worse. Fox is hilarious in their constant flailing around attempting to blame Biden for everything, it’s equal parts funny and sad
This didn’t include travel costs for non Floridians
Long lines frustrated parents. No longer the happiest place on earth.
They have to make up for the loss of those horrible woke movies like ahem snow white. Go woke go broke.
My family actually loves Silver Dollar City in Branson, MO.
I’ve been boycotting Disney for years. I had no idea what the cost had become!! Good night!!!
I'm 60 and I grew up working class. The closest I've ever come to a Disney park was watching "The Wonderful World of Disney" on Saturday evenings.   I knew kids who went to Disneyland. They were rich kids. Disney was never for working class people. Vacations that involved airplanes were never for working class people. If you were lucky, your working class dad got a week off during the summer and maybe you went camping for a couple days at a state park. Then again, maybe Mom had a big list of things for dad to fix and build during his "vacation".  All of this just smacks of privilege whining that they don't have more and better than they already have. Gross.
Nothing is cheap these days!  Did he have a good time?  Did he make his family happy?  Because that's what counts!   Stop bitching about costs in front of the family because your killing the vibe
Lol under the last administration? it’s gotten a little bit better? OK now I know this is just entertainment “news” because nothing about that is true. It’s only gotten worse with this administration for absolutely everybody and this Disney over price is unfortunate but at least it’s a choice unlike our groceries that the president doesn’t even know how to say but he ran on it and now can’t fix it.
All to brainwash you and your child.
So dont go to disney…
price gouging
better places to bring your children for a lot cheaper.the working class is getting destroyed. I know everyone's bragging how much the prices are coming down but I don't see it at all.
They have to make up the losses from the self proclaimed, “record breaking” movies that nobody went to at all! 😂
I don’t think most families have ever been able to afford Disney, especially if you have to travel out of state, but of course now it’s on another level
Go woke, go broke. Anything Disney, no thank you!
Clearly people have money to go. Probably not charging enough given the lines. Lot's of people, including Trump with his tariff policies, need to stop living in the past. There's a lot more important things to worry about where prices are going up.
He didnt check it out before he went? He couldve saved that money.
The prices are outrageous and not even worth it. Over priced admission, food and merchandise. Parking should be free for that price. They make it impossible for a regular family trying to treat their kids to the "experience" which isnt even all that. Thank GOD 🙏 for KNOTTS BERRY 🫐 FARM!!! Go to take your kids to KNOTT'S BERRY 🫐 FARM INSTEAD! They will love it, its affordable and FUN!!!
I mean yeah that's what happens with that many kids. There's definitely ways to go cheaper as well just less luxurious.
Walt would be so disappointed how they've taken that Park away from all the children. They have profiteer to the point where it's not even a magic it's not even believing it's just a money grab. And children of all financial demographics should have an ability to see it at least once
When you buy a Disney ticket, you are contributing to surgeries for Disney employees to change what they really are. Those are expensive surgeries.
I'm actually surprised it was so low. I think they did amazingly well considering they're family size. People with children tend to impress me. Disney died decades ago. I'm grateful & happy i got to experience Disney during it's final era of glory & and actually it was their blessed point in time where they had gotten new animation /artists that were behind The Little Mermaid, my favorite probably along with Lady & the Tramp and Cinderella. Disney hasn't been on my radar since the 90's honestly. I don't believe I've watched any Disney films since, and if i have I wasn't aware of it but it wasn't intentional as i am definitely not a fan in recent years. But i rarely ever go to the movies at all anymore and went to the theme parks three times in the 80's and that was enough. Thank you Mom & Dad!! 🙏🏻 The parks were a bit more sane then but i was sent on Magic Mountain without being buckled in by their staff, God watched over me but from that point forward my mom went on every ride with me and buckled me in herself. Definitely take care of your children because other people will not, and if you're going to bother to go there be very cautious over your family. The messaging isn't healthy, it is not the fun loving, charming experience of the past. ☹️😟
F*** around and find out..   😅😅😅
so the kid said it was packed so that tells me disney is still winning!!
No sympathy whatsoever. Disney's perversion and thievery are well-known now. So anyone vacant enough to _still_ patronize that filthy, disgusting, anti-American company deserves whatever comes their way. Don't use the excuse that your children beg to go, etc..Be the parent. Say no and, depending on their age, explain why you have made that decision.
Hate to say thing but the prices need to be higher than it already is because the demand is so crazy high.  As it is the park is way too over crowded and not enjoyable due to too many people being inside.  If the prices were lower the crowd would get so lard it would by like a dance floor night club inside the park.  Prices need to go up untill the amount of people going is lowered by at least 30%.
The price was STAGGERING 4 decades ago!! I wouldnt give 50 cents to go in there today.
Thats what happens when Leftist Woke Idiots gain control of a Fun park. Or anything for that matter.  Watch as it becomes unnafordable for regular people.
$1,400.00 per family and the park is packed. Somebody still has a lot of money to spend. LOL And I am worried about spending $5.00 for a dozen of eggs. LOL
This is what happened when you do not  do your homework. Blame yourself.
Let Disney go broke.
Good thing my kids don’t care about Disney. When they were little we went once and they hated the mascots and since then we never went back. They’re teens now.
I recently stopped going. It used to be kind of fun when I could take my little toddler aged kids in for free. Also, you pay the price to get in and then you spend even more once you’re in. You stand in HORRIBLE lines. It’s not fun. Very sad and I’m pretty sure everything Walt Disney didn’t want to happen.
$975 should RENT the park for a day
I mean honestly; Disney World has always been over priced. Even when my family and I went there when I was in sixth grade; it was still very expensive then too! ( I am 43 now) But YIKES!!! It was over $1400 for this family! 😮
Always loved Bugs Bunny better than the mouse !!!
It’s a ripoff indeed agreed
Wait the News Anchor said It’s gotten a bit better but exactly where.  😅
We visited Disneyland once while visiting Anaheim, CA. As you approach the park you see people walking from their hotels to the park. None of them looked like the people you see in any of the commercials. These people saved for years to visit Mickey. Inside, same story. Nearly all of the "guests" appeared as if they could not really afford to be there. It's as if they were all brainwashed.
I wouldn’t waste one cent on that woke joke democrat place!
the REAL magic is how disney world makes one's money disappear - POOF.
Growing up my dad got a job at Disney so we got in for free but it was still expensive just to buy meals and drinks and get something from the gift shops. I still have some great memories mainly traveling on the monorails and boats and the double decker buses that used to run around Epcot but now that I’m an adult and have worked there myself I avoid it like the plague.
It is way over priced but he got ripped off for 1 day, we went in february and we are a family of 4 went for a week and was $3,000. Thats with the park tickets and hotel.
I'm not surprised.  They have to pay all the woke people running Disney.  Mr Walt would turn over in his grave.  Other places to go. I'm do sorry you and your family went through this. Better vacation next time.
"......at least during the last administration?"  I could have afforded Disney last year,now it's just food and gasoline...I don't care what the rump says.....it's ALL more expensive ALL OF IT
This level of greed is just obscene.
Disney is overrated.
Walt never envisioned those prices. It is for children. Young couples grand parents can’t afford this nonsense. Boycott Disney
$1,400? That’s almost the cost of a trip to the grocery store!
I really don't know how people still go to Disney after what they have become.
I'm just going to say that Walt Disney wouldn't be happy that money is more important than kids to Disney. In 1966 when Walt Died the ticket price was $3.00 or $29.61 today and today it's $119.00.
SCAM. NEVER BEEN. NEVER WILL.
If the daughter thought that the best part was standing in line talking with her family, maybe the family could plan to sit around on their deck for a full afternoon talking. Sure would be a LOT cheaper and probably much more enjoyable
I was glad I got to enjoy visiting Disney and Epcot 5 times over my lifetime.  It was affordable and we had a blast.  That’s been 18 years since.  It’s no longer the same atmosphere or innocence as I’ve seen and read.  I hate it so for the families now.
Disney co. has crapped all over walts dream...
I've been to both Disneyland and Disney world cuz my daughter works for the company and just to let you know that they are both the creepiest places I've ever been to and don't plan on going back 😒
Try going to a MLB game or football game.  Just went to Fenway with wife and 2 kids.  4 hour event over 1000 dollars. $75 to park, decent seats , $ 600 and by the time food was done almost 1100.  The world is run on greed.  Why does a baseball player or quarterback need 40 million a year?
MAD Magazine already pointed this out in an issue almost 40 years ago.
Be patient. Prices will come down once the golden age begins.
Seems like Disney is doing everything they can to go OUT of business !!!
Woke Disney is done...!!! Bad deep state global leadership at Disney! Such moronic fools!!!
Try being a non resident and compare the new total.
Disney weirds me out , L.A. was overpriced -- especially food items
This is not the only thing in this country the cost has gone up prices !
DISNEY, the most expensive place on earth.     No longer happy.
u knew the price, dont go, u have a choice.   Mickey didn't twist your arm into going.   Take your kids to the park or the beach, it's free.    Pack a picnic basket, grab a frisbee, etc.. it's pretty fun.
Cheesy, crowded, plastic, overpriced.
Here is a solution to the problem. Do Not Go To Disneyland!!
I live in Clearwater, FL  I was born here.  Disney World opened in the 70's.  I didn't like it then and I hate it now.  I don't understand the attraction to it, no pun intended.  Disney sucks.  What a tourist trap.  I'd rather take my boat out on the Gulf of America any day.
When we where kids we lived right next to Disney land in California, we would go there sometimes for free from tickets from coke cans. It was fun and mostly free. Cheap food with fun rides. Now? No thanks.
Disney weirds me out , L.A. was overpriced -- especially food items
Disney is like a Disney movie. Just not worth it anymore
$1400 for the family is cheap
Wow. Spend this amount of money in 1 day, plus, give it to a company that has tried to impose their will on the community & government, sexualize children & and promote an anti traditional family agenda.  I don't denigrate & subvert LGBT people, they have the right to live as they wish, without judgement. But I DO take it personally that Disney chooses to subvert Christian beliefs & traditional values. Children's programming should be stories inspiring to the human spirit. Not propaganda built to normalize deviant behavior. Disney is trying to sow seeds in the minds of children & encourage behaviors that do not make most people happy. Focusing on their agenda, they can't even turn out engaging content. When is the last time Disney made something decent, let alone a classic.  Walt would spin in his grave.
Disney's favorite words today are greed and appetite.
I hate D world.  Six flags is way better to me.  I pay 20 at first and then 6 dollars a month for a season pass. Parking is free with it. Food is expensive but there is a whole pizza for 30 big enough for 3 people.  I also eat lunch before I go in.
Did she say that it has gotten a little bit better?? Fox news smh....
Water is wet!
Don’t pay the rat tax guys.
I could care less about Disney I never went and I never will go………..it’s just not worth it ..   ( Universal Park ) yes 👍🏼
Hey crag flying wheels utube channel😊
Last time went to disney, it was like $200 per person for all the parks for a week.2 water parks costs like $50 each for a day.
Awee that little girl is a sweet heart. Her parent's made waiting fun. Being arround family is fun. Less stress, talking awe
NOT ANOTHER DIME TILL THE END OF TIME
Time to Bud lite Disney .
I have NEVER known anyone who could afford to go to Disney.
yet another reason why, Disney is doomed. soulless corporation are never family friendly. go WOKE go broke. HA HA.
$uckers  😜
You have 5 children, how much did you expect it to cost.  You brought 7 people into the park of course it was expensive.  Florida residents get discounted annual passes. You could have brought food with you and drinks which would have saved you money. Out of states residents pay even more to go to Disney.  There are many ways to make it affordable.
So sad...  I grew up with Disney!!  😢
Mouse is a crook.....😅
What a beautiful answer the kid gave at the end. Her favorite time was standing in the line talking to family... Not many people on earth would say that lol.
Things are still too expensive
Disney always gave me creeps, too big money.
I can’t comment on the steep price paid for their day but well done dad on raising an incredible daughter, her favorite part of the day was waiting in lines as a family and talking with each other!  Wow, as a dad myself that kind of brought a tear to my eye to hear her say that.
U forgot to slather up on the orange sunscreen 😂🤣😭
Disney is over priced for nothing.  Disney went woke now they are going broke.
This is the used car guy on YouTube, isn't he? Seems he loses money on every sale. -- maybe needs some financial guidance.??😄
Disney needs to Sell ABC News....
Disney is a rip off it only caters to the super rich now. If your middle class your spending more then you ever should for their services and entertainment. Forget about ever being able to take your kids if your poor. Your basically spending down payment on the house just to go to their parks. Disney a bunch of greedy snobs. 2 kids and 2 adult tickets along with all the other expenditures your looking at $5000 to go. Not worth it all.
I can barely pay for my groceries and this dude is literally bitching about $1400 that he blew on a one day thing? That’s absolutely not relatable because I cannot name one person in my friends and family that would even consider doing that. That’s not pinching pennies, if that was truly what he was trying to do, I think we all saw a dozen things he could have done to be more “relatable “. A $44 toy?……I’m definitely not rolling my eyes.
Budlight this woke company.
If you're still supporting woke Disney don't be complaining about it.
It's DISNEY !!!!
That's why we RV. Buy the right brand and enjoy cheaper vacations with better value
I went when i was younger & i have to be 100% honest- I HATED it! Lol It was a nightmare from the lines & too many people- just everything. I dont know, i thought it was awful. My sister hated it too.
Can the Dad use Google?  You can research this ahead of time so there are no surprises.
Does Disney accept EBT and SNAP cards?
…And once you get in the family has to stand there for hours to get on a single 4 minute ride. Knowing that, how many rides can you even go on in a day.
Disney wasn’t been worth it for a while.  Years ago we would drive over for an afternoon. We would go to one of the big hotels and tell the attendant that we where just there to do some shopping and get a nice dinner. They would let you park for free. We could ride the Monorail and boats and visit the hotels. Now they would make you pay the $30 if you could park at all. I have a old ticket book from the late 70s early 80s the cost for a child was $8.75.
TRUMPFLATION
Meanwhile Disney is making a new high tech park in Dubai
Disney…  Overpriced Overrated Overcrowded   Demonic company
That price is beyond asinine
My wife works at Disneyland.  Those Mickey ears cost them 20cents probably.  They charge 10 bucks.  It’s crazy.  Today I’m wearing a shirt she bought me at the company store for 3 dollars.  The price tag was 64.99.  Yeah she got it for 3 dollars.  I won’t go for free.  I hate it.
It's not Disney's fault. It's the greedy corporate managers who are destroying the magic and laughing at the customer's faces.
My last trip to Disneyland was 1979.  I wouldn't go if you paid me.
Why pay that much to see the same old rides over and over again?
Yeah I'm taking my family to Epic Universe when they open...and it's literally half the price of Disney and everything will be open unlike the mouse house where half the rides are closed for one reason or another
This dude is just to cheap and broke. Come on man $1,400 is not a lot of money and plus it's for the entire family. If I had a family I would drop at least $5K at Disney because I love my family.
Way to much !!!!!!    You  shouldn't have to pay for parking  !!!!!!!!
You didn't have to go there!plus I think that anyone who goes there 🤔 it's like that I would like to have a brand new whatever but I have to live at my means!
I think the prices need to be that high because otherwise the park would be even more crowded.
Go to Gatorland!!! Old fashioned fun
Disney finished bottom line 😂😂😂😂
In interesting question to pose to the 3 kids: would you rather go to Disney or have $450 cash in your pocket to spend on what ever you wanted?
Boycott !!!
Disney has nothing I want anymore.
Disney has lost there woke minds. Never again....
Rat world is now a nightmare. Why would you even bother? That company is rich and they keep squeezing. Disney sucks.
It’s sad that Disney gets away with charging people this much and pushing their political agenda
What is Disney’s justification for doing this to customers.   People should ABSOLUTELY boycott this place.  It’s not like they are short on customers.  Really a lousy way to run this place.
FMM 🐭
Biggest joke in the whole country!!!!!   If everyone took a week and did not go to Disney, they would maybe change there prices!!!!!   So gross and disgusting!!!!    Let’s shut it down!!! Let’s tell everyone to not go to Disney, and go to mgm!!!! Or water park!!!!  Please post something that will stop everyone for just a day to protest against Disney!!!!   Prices are a joke!!!! 5 people no alcohol and almost 250 dollars.   How sick.
I lived about 1.5 hours from Disney for years and refused to Go ! I don’t understand why people still go There !!
Because people like you pay that ridiculous price, that’s why they overcharge for your fun day!
The headline made too much sense. I had to check to see if this wasn't an Onion video.😮
The Disney movies flop so hard they have to charge their Disney World customers in arm and a leg to keep the Disney company going. What a joke Disney has become. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bring your own cooler back pack with ice packs, food and drinks.  Disney welcomes that.  Save money
A couple of burgers and beers at a local grill in my town is now over $50 plus tip. I mean come on people, we're not talking filet Mignon here.
Quit supporting this place!!!
If most families can’t afford to go to Disney, then why is it still so packed?
For that price i better be able to do Minnie
Only one person
WOW! Too expensive!
It's rhe magik not the magic ghetto.
Disney has to make up for all the money they're losing by making garbage movies.
That's like going into Channel and being shocked China made bags cost $6k or more.
Stop going to Disney
Please tell everyone to send more help to all the Storm victims and children 🙏  Dollywood
I'm getting viewer vibes from Disney of,Listen,losers,if you can't afford our prices,maybe you should drag your poverty stricken (CENSORED) out of here.
Last adminstration my a$$
In the end the time with fam anywhere at any price is worth it -and people can do whatever works for them. Those days go really quick and people aren't around forever🥹
30 years ago, the last time I went to Disney, spent less than $200 for two people for the whole day.
Florida residents who are within 2 hours have annual passes because of this.  I gave up mine because of the cost after I got into the park. After Covid it became ridiculous.
That just shows how dumb he is for going there!!! Take her camping or something else. Disney is creep city these days
Disney is now only for the rich, the average person can no longer afford it. The price in the end per the few rides you are able to go on is incredible.
In my day Disney was 3 dollars to get into the park!📯💰
I WOULDN'T GO TO DISNEY IF IT WAS FREE. WHAT DOES DISNEY & A BLACK HOLE HAVE IN COMMON? THEY BOTH SUCK!!!
You can't go to Disney for a day you can't go to a football or baseball or basketball game for a day. Even going to the beach you got to pay for parking now most places. I'm 63 years old I remember growing up and doing things and not paying for anything. Now it seems you got to pay for anything you want to do
They've made it so that you only visit once in your lifetime.
Walts turning in his chryogenic grave 🤣🤣🤣
Elephant has more intelligence than Trump.  A Elephant actually knows how to save children during a flood
I Rather Spend that Money In Alaska and Go Up There And Fish For a week
The last time I went to Disney was over 5 years ago.  Stopped once they went super woke.  Used to go every year,  now we go to Dollywood in TN, family of 6 can get tickets for $600 and it’s super relaxing and much more of a family feeling.  Haven’t missed Disney one bit
It is a rip off
Thats insane 😮😮😮
"A sucker is born every minute" -- PT Barnum, showman.  Granted, I went with family this year to Disneyland (day trip), and I kind of get it?  They do a good job.  But for me, that one visit was enough.  I'm not gonna buy the clothing and sport bumper stickers pledging my damned allegiance to childish pursuits.
Well duh though
How long of your day did you stand in line for that day?  Go to the beach, Florida is big explore all of it , probably will be cheaper!
We went last year, and yes, it's expensive.... but there are some things you can do to save a little money.  It really comes down to planning and compromising.  We didn't buy much at the park,  especially food. We were mostly interested in the rides and not the merchandise, so that's what we budgeted for.
Go to Cedar Point in Ohio instead.  Beautiful park on Lake Erie with some of the best rides in the world, and you can currently get a ticket online for 50 bucks.  No Mickey Mouse or Disney princesses, but they have Peanuts (Snoopy, Charlie Brown) characters.
Have we considered a tariff on Disney?
I would never, ever, go to Disneyland. 1400 could be spent on better things. Imagine flying and spending the night. It would be 10,000 for the week. 😂😅
Tourists won't  be coming  here......they'll  feel it soon.
$1400 would be okay if you’re not thrown into a huge crowd of long lines like cattle.  Or if a ride breaks down you lose money / time
It’s a family of 5, of course you’re going to spend a lot of money.
Don't go! Simple.
The best part is always the rides. The worse part is waiting two hours for the two minute ride.
Now now!! You know the rules!  Pay me Mickey and Minnie!  😂.     I went to Disney back in the 2000’s and it was costly back then!
when people won the superbowl. they used to say they was going to Disney, because you always needed to win something to go to Disney,
Disney is trying to recover from all the losses of their crappy movies and decided to use the parks to recoup.
goign to disney is like supporting their woke agenda.
What'd did you expect its Disney World. A stale pretzel there costs 50 buck. Smh
You can tell his daughter has been raised to appreciate family !
And the best part might be that you get to wait on very long lines for the rides.  Unless you are willing to spend additional big bucks to purchase express passes.
Disney is owned by China
...and the majority of your time is wasted just standing in lines. The last time I went, it was $52. Even that was not worth it back then.
Suckers born every minute.
In 1975, as a family of three, we first went to Disney World, when they had the old "ticket book" system! It cost each adult $7.95  for a ticket book & included general admission, i.e. ($3.00 if you didn't go on rides)! Children under 5, I believe, were free & I don't think there was a parking fee! So, if you didn't eat food there, two adults & young child, paid less than $20.00 for an entire day's entertainment! Outrageous increases, today!
Place is a rip off. Nope nope nope
This is why we have never been to Disneyland and will never be able afford to. It is ridiculous and shame on Disney for making it so unaffordable.
You just helped them pay for the rainbow crap. Dont go there.
This is why Disney is moving across the pond
Wow $1400, that's what me and my wife spent in Austria for 6 days.
All of these costs are known upfront.  He still chose to pay so the price was fair.
Umm the cost of living hasn’t gotten any better since this administration. Idk what this new anchor is talking about. Prices and the cost of living have gone up. 🤦
At Universal you can buy a fountain drink 12 oz cup for $5 but it will only work once. They have a chip under the cup that is read when you fill the cup the first time, when you go back it won’t work. These places are designed to take as much money from you as they can. It is no longer about the kids, it’s about money and they want it all! Disgusting
Greed and Woke killed Disney for me.
If you can afford $1500 for a vacation day, stop being a baby about the cost.
Bros dumb… I paid that price for the hotel, and flight later this year. For 3 people for 3 days. He got got
Stay away from, it doesn’t even look like a fun place 😮
Yeah it's going to be a long time before I give my money to a rat in Orlando
I live in Cocoa Beach and I gave up on disney visits about 10 years ago. I don't miss it.
Trump's America gets more expensive each day.
We have always wanted to go, but never will. Cannot afford it!
DEI DISNEY!!!!😂😂😂
wow ! the  coast of doing Business with chinaa.! blind Americans  what  a  waist
Disney got tired of the riffraff.
I wouldn't take free tickets to Disney.
I can afford to go there but the value is not worth it. I can go to Italy, France, or England for much less and see many historical sites versus a ride created by a group of engineers and marketers.
Heller...just do your homework first before going...
Apparently its not expensive for the people of UAE to build a new theme park.
Disney should have a coupon day buy 1 get 1 free or buy 3 get 1.. 50% off and they still will make money 💵
pass
All in with travel and everything it cost me $8000 to take my girlfriend and her five year old daughter to Disney world for two days. And we flew spirit.
Disney has been overpriced & expensive for a long time.  Last time we went was 2009 it was $900 for 3 people WE stopped going never been back.
You can thank trump for all the higher prices. That's what maga supporters wanted higher prices inflation back again.😂😂
My friend went down from Canada. He told me it was $1700 per day. I thought he was kidding, but i guess not. It's sad my three older daughters will never be able to go with their kids. I took them when they were 8-10- and 12 years old. I can understand why it is so expensive because I'm a maintenance tech. The cost of keeping that place going must be astronomical. I think all these theme parks will go bye bye soon. No more cheap labor. Just to operate a 13 story seniors building is costing 2.5 times what it was 10 years ago.
Better under this administration? Are you Delusional? People are losing their jobs left and right! Can you just report the truth for once?
They gotta make back the 20mil they lost on Snow Woke.
Our last trip to Disney World was 2003. (Became too costly even THEN!!). But did Paris Euro Disney a few times & it was not as expensive. (Lived in Europe at the time)
To bad he gave WOKE Disney all that money. Would have been a good teachable moment explaining why WOKE Disney will never see another dime for us again, it' what I did for my kids when I cancelled Disney plus.
What an insane amount of money.
Thanks for exposing Disney!  How much did the give to the Dem Party?
This guy just came out of a cave? Try Google for all the prices. I guess he doesn't have a budget.
Nah, my kids have the Disney channel! No thanks
WowowowowowoW😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱.  I have NEVER gone to Disney……and NEVER WILL.  THAT IS RIDICULOUS!!  SHOW them..STOP GOING!!!!!
If Desantis and Vance got married and had a son together , it would be this guy 😂
Five people on a day trip to Disney and didn't bother to calculate the cost online before they went.  They eat in a park restaurant when everyone knows it's extremely overpriced.  Then do a video which shows you don't have any sense when it comes to money.  BTW, how much for the hat?  smh
Walt’s dream is dead.
Why you all complaining 1 day of boycotting them you will see how fast the prices come down
Last time I went was for the 25th anniversary and tickets were $85 then and a 16oz coke was $7. Disney has always been expensive.
You can cheaper toys at souvenir shops outside of the parks
Never vacation at a tourist trap.    Plenty of life-changing destinations.
What a RIP!
Rip-off
I wouldn't go there for free...
I wouldn't waste my money.. I'd rather save it and go on a real vacation.. In Alaska 🫎🫎🐻🐻🦅🦅
My parents and two brothers went there about 50 ago. I lived about 20 minutes from Disney in Anaheim. I never had the urge or the interest  to go there. Passed the Matterhorn every night on my way to work in Fullerton.
Was he told to wear those female ears.
Disney don’t want ‘poor humans’ making their parks less attractive for the ‘wealthy elite humans.’ Why charge less when you can charge more to thin out the weak and poor?
And yet the place is packed almost everyday !  It’s getting to be ridiculous with not only Disney but any family oriented park
You know if we all refuse to go for a few years, they'll have to drop their prices. Cost of FOMO
I wish I could take my kids, but I just can't afford to do that.
Sports shows are the same prices. We spent 1200 for a soccer game for a family of four.😮
Thankfully Mr. Stowell had the wisdom to not finance the Lightning Passes with a credit card. Surely he siphoned off from his savings account for the trip but he drew the line at some point.
Get the Pixie annual pass for $400 that includes free parking.
People have less now than a year ago. It’s only getting worse.
Maybe welcome to US due to its culture - go big 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Disney has to make back the money they lose on movies 😂
I think I'll just go fishing, my favorite rod, a box of worms, and I"m completely set!
I have been there three times years ago, i thought the most expensive price was food and beverages! Lines were crazy!!!!
Go work more overtime.
Fk fantasy land
I took my kids to Orlandoand its expensive also, You gotta save.  Id rather never go again do things closer to home.  As long as people pay  the prices will never go down.
A monthly mortgage for a day.  I’ll pass.
As long as suckers take their spoiled little princes and princesses to these "rip off" parks to watch people in costumes run around acting "Goofy" (get it??) they'll continue to take it in the ....well...dad's all know!!
The longest lines on earth. No fun
Disney, a company who believes in "DIVERSITY EQUITY & INCLUSION"  but only as long as you have a CREDIT CARD!!!
ABSURD
Disney should be ashamed
I’m a Florida resident and find Disney to be overvalued and overpriced. If company comes and they need some mouse, I will take them to Disney Springs where parking is free, entertainment is free, they have some pretty good restaurants, and if someone really needs a ride they can hop on one of the ferries to and from the nearby hotels.
Walt Disney World where you have to Check your wallet at the door.
The only ppl that can affird disney is, influncers and rich ppl. Lo
Why you shocked....fr
Woke policies have a high cost
I was there in 2014 ,it was great.
You really want to get angry? 41 years ago, we purchased 5 day passes, that allowed you to go to every park on 1 Single day, leaving 4 unused days for $99!! The real kicker, They never expire!! We purchased a number of 5 day passes, which still have not been used up. Talk about rate increases
Pince pennies but go to Disney? Oh ok.
The most costly place on Earth. Waste of money. People are so stupid, add up how many rides you actually get on and you'll see that the whole day was standing in line. I grew up poor, with a single mom and 4 sisters. My mom was able to entertain 5 kids at the beach, the park or at a campground with picnic lunches. As an adult, I don't feel I missed out on anything.
3:23 Her answer ❤
Wow. I pay $1400 for entire year of rent here in the Philippines.
He didn’t do his research
I think Disney is expense to keep the Riff RafF out
Woke companies are paying now.....and so are You if You still go these places
Disney is not worth it. Over crowded, costly, and wait for hours to get on a ride.
I went to both Disneyland and Disney World 20 years ago.  I’m glad I went then.
Absolutely ridiculous to spend that kind of money on Disney.
America has lost its affordability for housing, food, family entertainment, etc. This is a perfect example of how costs have gone out of control, and are only going up and up in the future.
How are avrge ppl supposed to pay that for a day out on top of everything else?.
so crazy;
How to be eliminated from "Father of the Year..." take your family to Disney anything.
🖕 Disney, and everything you stand for.
Was the food any good? To expensive
That’s not expensive. The economy is booming. I don’t see the problem here.
we as an extended family are still boycotting Disney 2 years in so we spend zero, zip, zilch, nada, nothing. 0.
I took my nieces and nephew to Disney world 40 years ago.  Didn't stay at a Disney hotel, just parking, tickets, one meal and 2 days of rides, no Disney merch, no snacks ... It was over $600.    That day I promised myself that I would never give Disney another dime. And I haven't
Ya ,the cost per ride in Disney. Not worth it ..u stand in lines for hrs .
Not like the original back in Anaheim back in the early 1960s.  That was a fun time!
I live in Miami.  I quit going to Disney many years ago.  Way too expensive and way too crowded
Never been to Disney, never will. BTW, Walter Disney was an immigrant from Canada, Toronto to be exact.
Steere clear of Disney in FL.  To costly..bush gardens. A bit cheaper
F Disney. We will not be going back there ever. They are completely ripping people off. Never again.
Complain about signing up for it
Mickey is robbing you that’s crazy
Disney 100% should be charged with price gouging, no way In hell it actually costs that much. I see nothing worth anything close to worth it, me and my family have 10x the fun at the local county fair all for $150.
We completely boycot Disney years ago. No Disney World, No Disney Land & No Disney Plus. No Regrets!
Pretty much the same as trying to go to a concert or a sporting event. Forget it.
never wanted to go to disnyworld anyway
Never been and never care to go.
I'm so thankful I over did it when I was well universal studios is still worth it but not for me anymore 😢
Everyone needs to stop going so they drop there prices!!!!
He shoulshve those mini ears os for spending this kind of money on this garbage. So instead of those ears, He should have big red S on his forehead for STUPID!
Disney is a scam. No real savings for florida residents.
Bye bye Disney! The world CAN live without you!
They trying to make up the money they invested in woke nation. 😂
Demand and supply, if you want the price to be lower, don't go there.
It’s cheaper to cruise
Oh you won’t watch Snow White. We’ll get you another way.
No kid cares what it cost
Disney is overrated. People need to stop drinking the Disney Kool Aid. People stop going and also stop buying other junk and prices will go down. Most people don't need a new car, a new home, a fancy vacation, should I go on?
Not worth it to support Disney’s destruction of youth by turning them trans
And yet people still go.
visit Epic Universe instead
$1400 for a single day at Disneyland??....No thankyou
Never been there and never plan to go. Not a Disney fan.
Only $1400?  Closer to $2000.
Its only going to get worse.
Well , stop going there .  Too pricey ? Then stay away . I know people really want to do that family thing and take the kiddos to Disney . At some point the cost will reach a  level where people must say no  , it's too costly and just isn't worth it . When attendance and thus revenue falls - which means demand falls , only then will Disney reel in their outrageous prices for visiting their parks and attractions .
That's not much more than going to redsox game sitting in good seats
Your insane to support anything Disney it's woke and totally against America, you're all lemmings.
Here is the solution to the overpriced day at Disneyworld. Don’t go….
Tariffs 🙏🏼
Cedar Point in Ohio is the same way!!
And it will only keep going up ..
With pedophilia linked to Disneyland employees why would you take your children there?????
I took my kids to Disney World years ago and never went back. It was nice, but It's way overpriced.  My kids loved Universal Studios better, and it's cheaper.
“What was your favorite part?” Daughter- “ just waiting in the lines and getting to talk to my family”  My response- “we could’ve did that at home for free!!” 😂 sure would’ve saved a lot of money to just go on a walk and talk instead.
I really hope Disney goes out of business soon.
RIP Walt’s dream - the suits are so greedy it’s insane.
Go woke go broke…
"stupid is as stupid does"
Ff Disney. Not worth it
Boy the news sure is slow today.
dei is so expensive and not just  at disneyland. So how much were the ears and other childrens' and wife incidentals?
Thanks Trump
A few things. Did he not research the cost prior to planning this?  If you average the Total Cost Per Person it is not that much.  Yes, it is high to go anywhere these days..
Well, it's your fault! YOU decided to go to a woke Amusement Park!!
Glad to see this video, didn't know it's so expensive.  Definitely won't go !
Disney was boring to me. I like universal studios. I stayed at royal pacific and got a deal where I could go to park 2days and city walk. I took a water shuttle in to park 1 hr early. I always got fast pass. Not that this is way cheaper but I didn't pay to park. Royal pacific was an amazing hotel.
You pay that much to stand in line for 90 minutes for each ride, that lasts less than 1.5 minutes. and how many rides can you go on in a day? 4, maybe 5? Soooo not worth it!
Disneyland So Cal,  July, 1988: ( Just before PCS to Guam) before Noon, stayed till 10:15pm after fireworks..  Parking: $6 Tickets: 3, $60 Lunch: $26 Gifts: $210 Games: bout $25 Ice Cream: for Spouse & daughter: $11 Waiting in line total: 3.5hrs Ride time: 15 min / MAYBE Dinner: $38 Stopped for Ice cream on the way home $13  5yr old in back seat asleep, after ice cream,  running down chin & clothes: FREE 😊 Couldn't SHUT UP about it the next day: Priceless 😊  Cost: $179 With gifts $389  Talk about the "good old days" .. 😮
Disney is a great place but the pricing has gotten out of control and the crowds are unreal.
Ever since Roy Disney stepped down Disney flip flopped for awhile but stayed true to concept of the magic the legacy Walt started.  Now the woke CEO's have greatly reduced a once great place for families and anyone wanting to escape the cares of real world in fantasy safe fun.  Now people need to go broke to go visit Disney Parks,  not for me and all the public woke agendas.
This is Bob Igers fault. The guy does not understand what disney is. He loses hundreds of millions on woke leftist movies and then tries to make it back by penny pinching and raising costs at the parks.   Disney sells a magical experience once you strip away that illusion its just overpriced junk.
As the comedian Jim Gaffigan said, "Well kids, it's either Disney or college."
Time to start going to Epic Universe and get your actual moneys worth! Disney is a total ripoff nowadays
" Gotten a little better????" What planet is that woman on??? Didn't she hear her president when he told people to cut back on their spending, take the financial pain caused by his idiotic tariffs, made up the stupid name "panicans" because people are concerned about the rising prices, and their shrinking 401(k)s! Meanwhile,Trump is lecturing us about what we don't need, and his secretary of agriculture is telling us to raise chickens in our backyards if we're not happy with the price of eggs, he is spending millions ( 30 million so far) on his frequent golfing trips,and a few weeks ago he was bragging about having " more gold than anybody else" in his ballroom at Mar-a-Lago! He's telling people to cut back on buying their kids toys,but he made a spectacle of himself basically doing a Tesla commercial in front of the White House, and telling everyone that he bought his granddaughter a Tesla Cybertruck which is a very extravagant gift for a teenager! That is where is priorities lie!
Went there in 1984, have never been back.  Even at that time we were stretched to afford their food.  Its far too expensive now and not really much fun. Plus the current patrons are mostly Asians, Chinese and other countries. Theres a theme park in Branson, Missouri ... Silver Dollar City.   Its small but fun and a great place for family.  Less than $100 per day, kids under 4 are free and discounts for Seniors.  We've been twice and would go back if in the area.
Supporting woke companies isn't normal for anyone.
never going here ever, and I am a wealthy citizen, no thanks
The 1400 is a months rent for me.
Dollywood sounds sweeter by the day. 😂
Not worth my money and time even if i got free entry as a veteran
I have some friends that are literally addicted to Disney and spend a ton of money and time in a somewhat distorted reality.  😑
It is only for the wealthy now.  My kids are grown. Glad they went when they were small bc for sure couldn't take them these days!  They need to end their theme song A dream is a wish your heart makes...the dream that wish may come true-if your rich... or that saying if you ain't got no money take your broke self home - yeah, that should be their new slogan.
Mickey is a geedy little rodent.
Think.most traveled from abroad.... I'll pass lmao
Disney is no longer worth it. And they are super woke so it's a no go for me anymore.
Never go not worth it !
Apparently the dad didn't know how to use Google before going on the trip
But someone promised to bring prices down on day one.  😂😂
Thought about a florida AP?
Anyone visiting Disney is dumb!
What…he thought it was cheap? Go back home and do something within your means, pop.
I think same day day pass is the same as several day park pass if not more
I paid 165 , just to get into Disneyland in 🍊county for the Star Wars side.  Dmn pedlle Walt..!!!! Your family is crooks..!!!!!
I took a trip to iceland for that kind of money.
OMG. Disney is very expensive.
Family friendly except red shirt day. I went once in the 80’s. We 3 spent 8 hours in line to go on 8 rides. The food and drinks were costly and it was not my happiest place to be. I’ve never been back.
3:05 We buy those types of toys days BEFORE we enter the park either online, or at a nearby Walmart. We found a treasure trove of Disney items at the Walmart that is closest to the Disney park. My daughter found the stuffed mermaids on Facebook marketplace using the locations close to the park. Same with buying Lego items near Legoland in Carlsbad, CA. Just a little help on that one. And/or those bubble blower guns. Buy those before. 😊
I wonder if Mickey pander Minnie, how much would that be?
My wife, myself and my 2 year old daughter went there in January of 1985 and it was expensive then.  Crazy.
Thank yourself for voting for Trump.
He had to put his YouTube plaque in the background. He doesn’t care about the cost. He cares about his fan base increasing. Dumbass Dad.
Disney gotta recoup the losses from snow white... so...
Wow, $1400., rides, food, etc. What was your favorite part?. Uuhhh, standing in line.😮
Typical. Disney stock tanked, they are ripping people off in Disney world. Their upper management is very nervous bc their bottom line is struggling 😮
Never went there probably never will what a rip off I go to six flags for a day
Disney is not a necessity.  And if they wanna continue to be egregious with the prices, vote with your wallet and not go.  There's a ton of other amusement parks in that area, which offer comparable entertainment for far less.   I've been to Disney back in the day when my kids were little, but I'd never ever go again.  Just not worth it
The higher price definitely keeps the less desirables out. I think they should charge more.
There is a simple way to fix this, Don’t go to Disneyland. Don’t spend your hard earned money at a place like that.
Go to Cedar Point and have more fun for a fraction
Then dont go....  what a dufus.. i went to wonderland 2 years ago and blew 1500. What a great time. We go once every ten years.. so what.   Pathetic
Ontario, Canada here ✋... Sounds like, "Canada's Wonderland". I'd actually argue? That it's worse. That's including the exchange rate. To boot? It's, cashless. I went to the bank and grabbed $500...from the savings account. Got there. Had to pull more out all day long off my card. Yes I can pop the $500 back into the savings at the end of the day but that's not the point. Bloody joke. Anywhere you go. I feel this father's pain, on a cellular level. God bless from Northern Ontario, Canada 🇨🇦 ✌️
Vote with your wallet and not go
That little girl brought a tear to my eyes. Good job dad!
Nope not for me
I wouldn't step foot into Woke Disney even if the admission was free!!!
That guy has zero cause for complaint.  He never heard of due diligence?🙄
Basically you’re extorted more money unless you accept that  you’re spending $1000 to wait in line all day
Disney world/land is the new Mordor
96-04 THAT PARK $5 A 4 DAY  HOPPER PASS $79-99  IT WAS GREAT 2015 THINGS GOT CRAZY KIDS WHERE BIGGER UNIVERSAL BETTER RIDES HARRY POTTER BETTER VALUE BUSH GARDENS IS GOOD VALUE AS WELL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well if people are willing to pay the crazy money and the parks are STILL packed…..what are you gonna do?   Either don’t go be part of the problem, or contribute to it.
Kids need to hear no.
Prices are so high because people keep paying and going, quit going and watch the price drop. It may take a few years but it will drop.
There goes her college fund
So sad 😭
I rather go to the worlds of fun it’s closer to me and its cheaper
Bend over, Walt will drive…🤣🤡🤦‍♂️💰💰💰💰💰
Dolly wood
Nope
Disney, the theme park for millionaires
KIDS.   WE.   GOING. TO. THE.  WATER 🌊 PARK 😂
It's a waste of time.and a.complete scam
Greedy Disney!!! So many children deprived of never going due to those prices. That's ashame! I hope they'll go into bankruptcy!
I wouldn't go to Woke Land if they paid me.
I visited Disney Land in 1957, and have always made it a point to never go back.
dont go to disney on a whim for one day lol... you can save on multi day multi park packages....    200 per person for ticket and 50 per person for dinner at disney is not unreasonable. you just werent ready for it lol!!!
I think everyone knows. We are all shocked that he just found this out. 😮😂
They said the place was packed!!! So a lot of peeps shelling out!!!!
Disney's dead. And there's no coming back. They did it to themselves.
Disney would not approve of the direction that Disney Company is doing!!  Sad!
lmao  Disney ? what a joke
They gotta pay for all those failed woke movie remakes somehow. Duh!
But their financials were just reported better than expected.  So, good for them.
Disney has never been in my to-go-list at all. I find it's boring and no value.
To add insult to injury, Disney doesn't pay enough to its workers so they can live in permanent housing (i.e., an apartment or home). Because Disney pays its workers so little, its employees end up living in their cars or hotels—true story, and this is a growing epidemic.
I was born the same year Disneyland opened. My family lived less than an hour away from there. So I remember going to Disneyland several times growing up. I have very fond memories from our visits there. But my last time was as a young married woman in the mid 1980s. Even then I was shocked by the entrance fee. Now, you couldn’t pay me to go. Their obscene prices and wokeness make me more nauseated than being on the tea cup ride.🤢
People can’t even afford rent or food and this guy is bitchin about Disney prices.    SMH.  Unreal.
The Trump economy golden age 😂😂😂😂
Greedy Rat!
Trumps fault obviously...and tarrifs right cnn?  😂😂
You can build a whole ride in your backyard for the cost of one Disney ride… 😂
Disney there's nothing but corporate greed.
Groomers appreciate his business.
Disney can ROT!!!
Disney is no longer family friendly.  Over prices not like it used to be in the 90’s and earlier.  Worthless.  Disney park has changed for the worst after 1998.
He’s being conservative. His experience in my opinion was on the low end. It’s so crazy expensive and unattainable for most nowadays. They allow way too many people in the park so it’s impossible to do it all. They purposely do it to extend your stay.
No sir ree no way
If you keep paying it, they will keep charging it ! Wake up!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 lmfaoooooo couldn’t & wouldn’t be me! Such a waste of money
That is outrageous
Flying Wheels!!! Love this channel 👌🏼
Never
😂😂 I’ll go to Disney world. Disneyland in California is way more expensive just for tickets. Disneyland in California is astronomically more expensive. Because…well California.
They’re trying to get every dollar after that snow White disaster
One night lodging for a family of 5 would lily be another grand!  How else would they pay their DEI hires (victims) if they didn’t pillage the families
CCP did this !!
You can go to Switzerland for less than this. And I would a million times rather go there.
A few choices: buy Disney stock; don’t go; make friends with cast members and have them get you into the park.
He didnt Google it?  What a moron
Pay all that money just to sit in lines all day. No thanks!
Delusional spending that much. I live in Tokyo it’s less than $100 a day. A meal is $10. Spending thousands at a theme park is just stupid and all about social status. Give your money to something else
Some of us will never see the place .a lot of us .cut out by how much you make my kids will never know the wonder .
Disney went woke and now they are broke! They have to charge this much for their liberal views. Boycott Disney world everyone and put them out of business.
Wow, the fruits of corporate greed. Let’s be sure to give DeSantis proper credit. Hopefully you didn’t have to take I four to get there extremely dangerous and awful traffic. We had federal government funding for rail around 2010 or so from the Obama administration, but Rick Scott turned it down
This is not inflation. This is corporate greed. They started pricing customers out years ago.
It’s gotten a little bit better? Where?!
Not surprising that they just posted a profit. I wonder how they’re doing internationally with feelings against US companies?
How to find a better place than going to Disney
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
0:37 those minnie mouse ears cost $29.95😳🤣
Disney needs the money so they can keep supporting transing your children and DEI policies.
Wife just justbdrug me and kids there for a week back in march..... hurts thinking about it
Ridiculous. I would never support that Woke Lib Alphabet-Pushing Company nowadays. Walt must be spinning in his grave.
Pay all that money to wait in long lines
A cheaper solution: show your kids pictures of the all the lines. Tell them they will spend 20x longer walking around and standing in line than they will on actual rides.
We went last year and spent 2 days at Disney, the total cost just for 6 of us at Disney and not the rest of the week was 3,800. It's a waste of money you deal with the heat and dumb people all day to ride 4 rides.
My wife and 10 year old want to go to Disney so badly, but they understand that that's not going to happen until Disney quits with the woke BS.
I say boycott Disney and shut them down
At first glance 0:32, I thought “Wow, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has a doppelgänger…who also lives in Florida!” Seriously, I appreciate this dad for bringing this to everyone’s attention.
The park caters to the rich.
Did she just say, its gotten a little better!!! Where does she live.
I live 30 mins from Disney and haven't been in over a decade and couldn't imagine paying those prices.   But if it's already crowded, how much more crowded would it be if they lowered the prices to something more reasonable?
I last went to Disney in 1997 and would never return.  Paying a small fortune to stand in line all day while being grossly overcharged for everything is not my idea of fun.  I can come up with many alternate activities that actually are fun for a small fraction of the cost.
Real Floridians dont go to the theme parks...its an obvious scam.
Disney will cease to exist.   GOOD
They dont use all the cars on the rides so you cant get to ride all the rides in 1 day
I wouldn’t go there if they paid me $2000 to go
WOW, that is an average cost  $195 per person just to get inside!!  I will never visit Disney Land again and I'm guessing my grandkids won't either.  And $30 for parking - is it paved with gold???   I can't imagine paying for their food either.  This is Greedy Land now.
Until they stop trying to advocate for sexual deviance Disney gets $0 from me.  Not for a park, not for a movie, not for a subscription.
Don't be a sucker. And not even a piece of cheese.? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 🇺🇸😎
I’m father of five and live in Florida. My wife and I stopped going because it’s way overpriced as well as the food that’s not even worth the price for some tasteless food.
Please don't spend a dime at Wokeland
Only a damned fool would patronize this nightmarish tourist trap.
Disney is woke and over rated - waste of money
Disney is dead to me.
Bad disney, you should be ashamed. i bet Mr disney is rolling over in his grave
No way in hell
then add hotel and airline tickets
Don't want to do Disney. So much other things to see and do. Try Gettysburg!! Or perfect time for Lexington and Concord. And if you have girls Concord is home of the author of Little Women! Or Mackinac Island, or...
Rip off 101
Forget the lightning pass just say the mom is pregnant and they’ll give you a wheelchair and you’ll be able to go to the front of the line at each ride. Also, you won’t have to walk all day long.
Admission is $109 x 2 adults + $104 x 3 kids -- That's $530.  Florida residents can get admission for as low as $60 per day. eg $300 for 5 people
That’s some Bullshiite..!🤠
What the hell did he expect?
And this family got Flordia Residents huge discounts and it was still outrageous. Triple that for visitors out of state!!!
Family of 5, yeah its gonna be a crack! There are ways you can do Dianey cheap. Just showing up without a plan is gonna cost you. We can do Disney for a week, 4 park tickets, moderate Dianey hotel and food costs us about 3k bur that's just 2 of us
Disney is SUS
Should have chartered a boat for the day. You would have saved money and got some fish
The woman running Disney has two trans kids. Stop giving Disney your money people.
Mid 1990’s paid $36 a ticket and $5 parking
I was raised in Anaheim and my mom was a single mother with six kids. In the 70's she managed to take us a few times, but I think it's very sad for the underprivileged kids that actually live near Disneyland that can't afford to go. At the very least they should have a program for local underprivileged kids to go in the off season. Or have insentives through local schools so if kids keep their grades up they could earn a ticket..
To be fair, a pro sports game with parking, decent seats, food and drink would be just about the same and that would only be for 3 or 4 hours not a whole day. Bottom line, live (non video) entertainment comes at a very high price these days.
Sorry, it’s hard to feel any sympathy for a YouTuber complaining about high prices.  Besides that, it’s Disney.  They’ve been overpriced for years now.  Just imagine if this guy worked a regular job like most of us and didn’t get the easy money from just making videos about his hobbies he’d be doing anyway?  I honestly bet the whole reason he went to Disney in the first place was to make a video complaining about it knowing it’d go viral and he could profit off of it.
The guys on the internet crying that woke world costs too much, and next week, he's gonna be back crying that the Taylor Swift concert was too expensive. Seriously, parents take your kids to flea market. It gives your kid more realistic expectations and shouldn't cost you more than 2$ to park and get in.
They cut the part where they ate nonstop throughout the day
with that kind of money, I would have flown to Jaimaca on a 5 star all inclusive resort for 5 days and would have had a much better time than waiting in those long lines at Disney.
Hey, it's The Golden Age of America.
I am sad, I have been to Disney World 7 times.  I have taken my son three times.  It's so expensive now,  I don't think I will be able to take my grandkids.  Very sad
The best part is standing around talking to family? I can do that for free.
Anybody out there remember the coveted  E-ticket? I think you got two in the booklet, so you had to make them count 😅
"I will bring the prices down on DAY ONE" 🤡
its never worth it. ever. nope nope nope. ill never do it.
"I liked waiting in line talking to my family"  That's GOLD for Disney.
Boycott Disney !!!
I grew up in Florida, and never, not once did I ever have the desire to go to Disney. He's dumb for wasting his money.
Thhe prices disney have to be that expensive
Americans think they have to go to Disney imo. But the girl gave the answer that she liked having a nice family trip and actually spending time together in a nice way. That could have been realised at a fraction of the costs. Besides, Disney should simplify its attractions somewhat reducing costs with 30-50%. PS I am not American but Dutch.
I wouldn't go to a Disney park even if THEY paid me $1400.
It's a complete rip off these days.
Cannot stand that place went once in the late 90's and it was a rip-off then. That plus I would not give a wooden nickel to anything affiliated with Disney, ABC, ESPN, HULU and anything under that umbrella.
I used to live not far from Disneyland in the early 70’s. My parents would drop my older sister and I off with $30 and we could stay all day including food, lol. I haven’t been there in years, nor do I have any plans to. Disney is no longer family friendly.
Not our fault you chose to have 5 kids … while I agree it’s so expensive compared to when I was a kid, all the more reason to not have kids you cannot afford.
And yet the lines are ridiculously long still
I don’t know why anyone is so addicted to going to Disney that they will cough this up.  If you’re so wealthy that you can, then do it.   But if you’re even on the margin, don’t turn your hard earned cash to them.  On top of it all, if you don’t like their movies or what they’re doing to the parks, then they insult ‘You’.  They brand you all sorts of names.  How do you reconcile that????  If your bank labeled as some “-ist” because you didn’t like the wait and complained, you’d close your accounts and go somewhere else.   If you’re paying that much to go stand in line, then it’s on you.
What a sweet kid.
We've never been to Disney and we never will.
I have 2 books of tickets from Dinney Whirl from 1976, I usually bought double on tickets so the next time we wouldn't have to stand in line. The book contained one ticket for entrance to the Magic Kingdom, one ticket for transportation from the lot to the Magic Kingdom, and eight key tickets good for any ride in the park. These books of tickets were $8.89 plus .36c Fla. sales tax, and printed on the ticket book the claim that this book was $14.70 value. The book of tickets was called Magic Key Book.  Don't it make you want to poop your drawers at today's prices.
Take them to the beach instead. Go hiking. Go camping by a lake. I hate crowded places like amusement parks.
Disney can go fk themselves.
No thank you
The last time I went to Disney World was going to be the last (2015).  The price of everything there - the food, the parking was absolutely absurd.  For now its no longer happening!
I remember it being $20 a head back in 1973 to get into Disney World. Now you can get in for that same price, but you can't be American.
Disney is not getting one more of my dollars. My entertainment money goes elsewhere.
He is a better man than me, I would have left before paying those prices
why would anyone encourage Disney in the first place is beyond me .....
My granddaughter and me, 4 nights was over 10,000.  Open credit card balance.   So many fees
Build another park in Texas, lower the costs at the existing parks and increase the satisfaction of guest experiences.   They won’t do that because it’s all about greed.
Is it intentional that fox news and they are an entertainment company, not news always have to mention that the last administration you could not afford it then... guess what cant afford it now under the new one... Disney is responsible for their prices all amusement parks are... last i checked the president either does not dictate prices or at least they should not. besides what are they complaining about they voted for higher prices, and they got them.
“ we’re all trying to pinch Pennie’s”??  Um apparently YOUR NOT 😅
Needs or wants moment  Is it worth it? Guess either it’s too expensive to family chat while waiting in line or just a dumb answer 😮
They say "It's the happiest place in the world." I think that is because they can get so much money in one day!
From UK, I would never take my children to Disney in Paris.   It cost a whole lot less for a whole lot more simply to visit France itself for a few weeks . . .
I have never and would never go to that ripoff.
Disney is a total rip off  The lines are long and it's so hot 🔥
Nope. Not even a chance. Ridiculous.
I bet you if they showed people how much it cost to run a theme park like they wouldn't complain. A theme park is not suppose to be a every weekend trip.
Blaming the last administration.  Fox scumbags
He probably spent his tax refund money and if I believe let's see if you're a parent of a child or two or three children let's say you get 3500 back from the IRS per child so if he's got two children that's $7,000 minus give or take 1400 he'll still have enough money left what is he crying about from the child tax credit what is he crying about.
I would never go to Disney and it has nothing to do with money
Alot of money for a dump
Disney as a company fundamentally and structurally were broken long ago.
Last time I went to Disney World was early 90's.  Excluding souvenirs, it cost under $100 per person.
nobody is FORCED to go to these parks,, if you cant afford it,, STAY HOME! this country is FULL of entitled people who think they are all kings and queens who deserve to be treated like ROYALTY even though they are anything BUT royal!
priced up from the uk,  2 week stay £7000 for 3 people no food no flights, thats knocking 10k.......and thats at all star
F###  Disney that place is going down very soon
“Happiest Place on Earth”😉
Lets boycott Disney!!!!!!
I agree let's boycott Disney
Disney needs to pay for lawsuits from its employees
We took the kids back in 95 for a week.  We stayed in the Disney hotel the train runs through.  When we left I gave the last $5 I had to the bellhop who helped us with our luggage.  I had to stop at an ATM to get more cash for the trip home.  I told my wife I felt like I’d been to Vegas and lost all my money.
notice how faux news never misses an opportunity to blame a democrat for ANYTHING!! such a disgrace, but TYPICAL for FAUX NEWS!!!
Guess where we are not going this year and I live in LA.
Dad had me at $30 for parking. My respect goes to him for willing to spend that much money for a one day trip at DW with his family, cause I'll go Amazon me a trampoline, swing/slide set, a kiddie pool for the bottom of the slide, and you'll hear me tell my (future) kids that we have Disney World at home before I spend that kind of money at a park just for one day. 😅
Disney is only for the rich.  The upper middle class need to take out loans to pay for a week, even in the cheap hotels.  It's ridiculous.
3k per day to fund their Woke
It's a theme park??  Enjoy your family and stop worrying about the cost.
The Diz has to pay for all its cr@ppy movies…!
Coastal elite. $5000 for you and I is .05 a nickel to coastal elite
I never went back since the late 90's. Its not worth the effort nor the cost.
Meanwhile, in developing countries, families suffer chronic health problems cause they lack clean drinking water and basic nutrition. Now, tell me about that pricey trip to Disney for your family of five again. First world problems.
Keep in mind that the skip the line feature cost around $30 per person.  So you skip the line jumping ahead of people who have been waiting making that "standby line" take longer.  The longer the standby line gets the more enticing it is to buy the feature. It's an endless cycle of pay to skip to purposefully make the line take longer so they can get more people to skip the line.
Back in the days my friends and I used to sneak in at Disneyland in Anaheim.
Aw, Dad look genuinely touched by his little girl's last comment, pretty cool.
I’m Fl resident and they had a deal that was litterly everywhere here for cheaper tickets and even for all parks. We got a hotel each time and we spent probably less than that for one day. Look for the sales and Fl residents they usually have discounts on some hotels. But yeah still it’s no joke 😢
What the actual f*ck is that?! My man was robbed at mousepoint
Disney has achieved its goal - it has become as expensive as any other 5-start resort vacation  experience without providing 5-star food or service. We looked at going for 5 night in September, and all-in with a Disney hotel, resort passes with park hopper and waterparks, fast passes, the meal plan, and airfare, it was $9,500 for four people. Decided to go to a 5-star all-inclusive resort in Turks & Caicos for $7,500 for the same 5 nights.
Years ago, Disney Parks were a drain on the company, which made most of its money off movies and Disney channel programming… but now that Disney went woke and can’t seem to put out a good movie, and is carrying its other failing investment companies like ABC, the parks are its main source of income, that’s why they try to squeeze every penny they can from park visitors and try to cram as many as possible into the parks and lines…
I wouldn't spend $139.91. Crowds, noise, traffic/travel costs, and expensive hotels weren't mentioned.
Disney doesn’t care about people it’s crazy people give them
This dude wearing Minnie mouse gear after Disney ripping him off is the best metaphor for Americans ever.
The message to me was, not to have so many kids.
🤔 Their House 🏡 is in Foreclosure 😫💸
Can't wait till they go broke
I was one of the first kids to go to the Florida park the first year open. Still have a left over ride ticket. I live the place but won’t pay those crazy prices.
What a monstrous waste of money.
Like someone forced them to go there….
I haven’t gone to Disney in years due to their greed
Needs a major makeover! Same as it was 50 years ago!!
Walt Disney is rolling around in his grave. His entire business was geared towards families. He would be absolutely disgusted by the fact they make it so expensive that families can’t possibly even go anymore. It seems like after all the millions and millions they’ve earned through the years they could reduce the price so families could actually enjoy it again.
Gotta make up for SnowWhite
Don't pay to fill your children full of crap
As long as people will pay that , they'll charge that.  Could have taken a week vacation at a cabin on the lake for that. Whole week wirh the family.
Its funny how people will cry about the prices of a trip or something 😂 just don't go and if everyone standa their ground i promise they will lower the rates.
There are many ways he could have cut his cost. Did he try any? Yes Disney is expensive. Do extensive research before you come. There are many websites that can help. Chat with a Disney rep. All you have to do is search, saving money on my Disney trip. Spend your money wisely.
Back in around 1974 my mother found a fifty dollar bill flying away in a parking lot. She ran and got it. It covered five of us for admission. Not the food and extras for one day. However, wages weren't much then either but still adjusted for wages it's way more expensive now.
Why she didn't blame trump quick to blame biden
We never took our daughter to Disney and lived in Florida for 50 yrs.  No way am I giving them my hard earned money.
WALT IS SPINNING IN HIS GRAVE TO SEE HIS DREAM FOR A FUN SAFE AFFORDABLE FAMILY VACATION TRAMPLED BY CORPORATE GREED
We drove there couple of decades ago when my kids were small. I hated all the long lines. What a vacation: standing in FUQNG 1 hour lines for a 2 minute ride, and food so expensive. Never again, specially since it's gone WOKE .
I have an idea: boycott the theme park until the prices go down!
Well with a lot of Canadians deciding not to come down to Florida thi year i guess there jacking the prices up to make up for the lost tourism dollars
What about airfare and hotel for out of towners
Regular families cannot afford this.
The park will always be crowded, and people will always pay because they love the charm of Disneyland. People are obsessed with it and the corporate greed knows it
Costs big money to groom.
I don’t know how any family affords Disney or their cruises. It’s insane.
Oh, gosh!
Disney charges more for less these days. It’s a real shame how they gauge people who love the place. They are greedy as all get out. The fast pass used to be free , now they charge a lot and you can only go on a ride one time with it. Disgusting greed. Plus they are woke as all get out. It’s a real shame how the corporate greed has tarnished Walt Disney’s park and business.
Why would you even want to go to Disney?
All that money to wait in line all day
Disney is based off of child molesters
don't be woke & you won't be broke.......Disney is woke hell!
Fam-Dam could have fished on a lake for pennies.
People need to stop going there, Walt Disney is rolling in his grave
Way too expensive.  Both Disneyland and Disney world.  Walt Disney would be disgusted.
Branson is a lot Better. Bring your Boat and fishing pole. Keep the freak's in Disney.

1998 I paid $65 for two but the lines were 3.5 hours long each......four rides in 10 hours, left that night and never came back. But as long as fools go and pay............................................
Bye Disney and his  ideology.
Disney, is surely taking the American public for a "RIDE"..... And to top things off! They are opening a brand new Disney land in Abu Dhabi, and one in the UAE soon!   with American hard earned money! That money should be reinvested in the USA not overseas.
Disney has become Woke and Corrupt. Disgusting 🤮  The CEO needs to be FIRED
We took our two children for 2 days / 3 nights 40 years ago. It was fun and affordable then.
No kidding, so you never looked with all the information at hand what it would cost you? You’re a business man?
Disney is ONLY for the "well to do", pricing certain "communities " OUT. 😂😂  And Disney movies and shows are ONLY for the WOKE DEI community whooooo....most likely are also priced out of Disney properties.  😂😂😂😂😂   KEEP shoveling them your $$$$ schmucks 😂
So that Dad....he wasn't from planet earth??         I mean who doesn't know.....
This is what you refer to as a "First World Problem"
Staycation 🍯🍻🍺🏀🏏🥎🎱🎧🪠🪛🛠️🍓🍍🍌
Disney is so greedy now. Disney hotel, tickets, park food, express pass, etc $$$$
WALT DISNEY WOULD NOT APPROVE OF THIS. DISNEYLAND WAS CREATED FOR CHILDREN AND WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AFFORDABLE
The fact that Disneyland has a lighting pass when they know most of their patrons are waiting for hours in the hot sun says alot about their greed
Entertainment isn’t fun when it costs that much.
Take your kids to a trip to some National or State Parks. Healthy, cheaper, educational, bonding.
I think the reason Disneyland has gotten so expensive is that since the company was consumed by wokeness Walt Disney's head has been spinning so fast in the cryo chamber it's been generating enough heat to thaw out so they've needed to upgrade the cooling capacity significantly, and all of that refrigeration takes a ton of power which isn't cheap
There is a HUGE disparity of income between the rich and the poor.  A wealthy person would have spent the same amount of money on his family , however, the cost would not effect him. The cost of the trip should be entirely based on how much people earn.   If I earn 500K a year, I am willing to pay double so this man could reduce his cost by 50%. Society is completely corrupt!
I prefer Disneyland in Anaheim over Florida.
That’s simply gross! Highway robbery!
Wait until Epic Universe opens in a week or two. Disney World is in for a rude awakening.
And it has nothing to do with energy prices and tariffs, just outright brand protection pricing.
I've always been shocked that Disney charges to park and go in and spend money.
I would not pay that for a day in Disneyland, but each to his own.  They seem to get enough people to stay in business so not my problem. Personally I'd rather save up money and take my kids somewhere more educational, like visiting a foreign country.
No thanks, I'd rather go on a real vacation like an island. Disney?
no common sense.  as a Florida resident it is way cheaper to buy your family the cheapest Annual Pass and get free parking always AND why spend that kind of money to eat at Disney Springs, eat at the park that you paid to get into.
White people problems so pathetic
Disney is woke. Why subject your children to the idiocy.  Its not worth the money to go
That's greed running rampant...just don't go there.Go do something else fun elsewhere.
Most amusement parks start at $85 + per person for a full day
So the dad’s acting as if this is some big shock/surprise?
Hahahahaha all the reds in the comments hahahahah Disney still in your head
Hell no
Walt rolling over in his grave
I’m sad to see that so many parents of young kids are still forking over gobs of money to the ultra-woke Disney empire.
lola
They’ll pay that but complain about the price of eggs. Got to have those social media pix at Disney….
SeaWorld and Universal aren't going to run you any less. Not just Disney, it's the entirety of Orlando.
It’s packed so other people don’t mind apparently
It's gotten a little bit different under the new leadership Really what 1 cent difference lol
Hahahaha keep crying
Micky the Money Grubbing Mouse.
Went to Hong Kong a couple of years ago.  And admission prices spiked up as soon as I arrive.  So I just cancelled on HK Disneyland
Disney doesn't want poor people at their parks.
Imagine paying 1400 and you still have to see a trans parade over there
Paid the same amount 15 years ago at Disney land express line package for a family of 5
My dad tells me disney was free to walk into. And the S ticket 🎫 was the best rides 😅😂
They destroyed Disney
Mouse trap
Nice answer from the daughter so sweet,  but if the best part was talking with family, I'm sure you sit anywhere you want at home and talk for free. Just saying
Seriously for family of four two summers ago was very painful. It was hot and the restaurant couldn't seat us and my cousin's family together so we had to sit outdoors in the scorching heat. The rides had long lines too. Waste of $$$
he's a business owner that went to the park, could the employee of the business owner afford to go to the park...?  and there we have the cast sys. separation...they only want the rich people in the park...
That is ridiculous to complain about something he should know ahead of time and can easily save some money by being better prepared. Why does he have 3 kids instead of 1 or none?
The mouse got everything but @n@L, or did he?
Suck it up people. Disney isn't cheap. No matter if you go to Disney World, Disneyland or one of the international Disney parks over seas
Guy spends $1400 for his daughter to say her favorite part was waiting in line hanging with her family 😂. Just go to the beach or spend the money on backyard improvements. Those parks are cooked.
Okay, but this dude still paid it. Stop complaining and take your girls to the beach or take them fishing or camping....
Omg 😳
Disney theme parks are only for rich people.
Sure ... Blame Biden for prices increase ! When will you grow a spine to admit the mess that Donny made ?
This is why my children never went to any Disney parks. It's very sad but it's their fault not mine
If you  can't  afford  it the Maga could afford foxsup  trump
I agree it’s super expensive
If people will boycott Disneyland, they might be forced to lower the cost or close the park
Fox news and most miss the biggest cost.   INDOCTRINATION of your kids to the alphabetNazism of Disney.
You pay THOUSANDS to get into the parks AND then sometimes the wait time for one ride could be 3 to 4 hours!°° Somebody needs to post the ride times?? MANY,MANY times we waited 3 hours for a ride that last 5 minutes..DON'T waste your $$$..
That Guy is a Business Owner Who Has Money 🤑  He Also has a YouTube Channel to Make a lot Of Money! He's a Show Off!
We used to go there several times a year when it wasn’t ripping off. Not anymore
They have to pay for trans surgeries for their leftist employees 😂
I thought this was America?  You didn't know how much it cost?  Don't go and maybe prices will come down.
The ugly part of greed
As much as I HATE the leftist organization Disney has become, no one is forced to go there. Yes, the prices are insane, but so are the multitude that pay the price. As long as they fill up their parks, they will continue to raise the prices. As for me, I would have to be paid to go there. Nothing but misery, packed in lines in the heat for some brief fun. Keep in mind, this guy only did a day trip. Add in accomondations and the price is truly insane!!
Tax Corporations !!!
Many of the costs will pay for their dei programs and many dei administrators
Wow. I never imagined. We went in the late 70s and early 80s, maybe 3 times total. I have no idea what it cost my dad back then, but I remember it being expensive for the time.
the problem is.. you still spent it, people still spend it. locals, tourists, it doesn't matter so they will continue profiting.
It’s a joke!!!
I wouldn't go to a Disney park even if I worked at one and got free passes.
Let’s climb the wall and get in for FREE! Well it worked for the last four years😉🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Boycott Disney - Don't Go
Maybe if their movies weren't bombing it be cheaper
I’ve passed this place with sadness several times.  I feel bad because I can’t afford to visit.  Oh well!  😢
The parking toll should have been the first clue to not go in!!
Last we went there, we never once saw any Disney Characters the whole time we there.
This shows its doesn't matter how much money you spend as long as youre doing something and being an active parent with your child thats all they care about. Give them your attention
Unbelievable…… Disney in Orange County is just as expensive! Total rip off…. California is a far left state and this is because Newsom and his left winger minions, & Disney CEO’s and staff.
A liberal run company.  A total scam.
I mean, you knew how much it was. could have just not gone. i stopped going after my kids were 18. prefer to rent a boat and go sandbar hopping for under 600 for half a day
$1,400 to stand in lines all day? Nope not gonna do that stuff.
They have to raise money to produce their social engineering movies.
My son took his 4 kids for a 2 day excursion and it cost them over 3000 $.
It was crazy 5 years ago...we did 4 tours of duty to see the mouse....I will never go there again.....
No one forced them to go. Its like going to the Lamborghini dealer and complain that its out of their price range.
That's absolutely disgusting! I wouldn't give Disney a single dollar! They are actively working to groom America's children and to turn them in to victims!! STOP giving Disney money!!
We are a family of 4. I guess my kids will need to learn to be ok with never meeting Minnie mouse.
Dad's whining spoiled it for the whole family
just wait for college, Craig....
disney and vegas - pricing themselves out of the market.
Take a hike in the mountains instead.
A place for family and kids that they can afford to go 🙄💩 shame on them!!
Of course the wife and daughter would say "Oh yeah, it was worth it!!"  when they didn't have to sweat and bleed to fund much of it.  Dad suffered for them to stand around and complain about the heat and the time spent standing around waiting in lines and excessive costs for food.   a trip that lasts 4 days costing $10k isn't worth it anymore.
Why do you want to pay that kind of money to see a bearded man dressed in a snow white costume?🤣🤣🤣
Go every 5 years and spend like a bastard. Enjoy the hell out of yourself. No vacation compares. None. Only trip I spend big bucks. Do it right or don’t go at all. Get deluxe, eat deluxe, get your fast tickets, enjoy yourself. Or stay home at six flags. Done
Girl wanted some brownie points
After Disney trip?  He should never have gone in the first place.  What was he thinking?
Place used to be fun, now it's a perverts paradise.
It's not worth it. Walt Disney's frozen head is spinning underneath Carnation Gardens (if you know, you know). Woke management has destroyed the Disney magic.
Such a rip off
You couldn't pay me to go to Disney.
Stop complaining just don’t go if you can’t afford it.
Lmao poor trash,don't go to disney if u can't afford it
I'll bet their barely  covering their bills the park that is and yes that is pricey
Easily researched.  This is fluff.
Took a trip to Disneyland a couple weeks ago with my grandkids, and it was horrible. $400 dinner for bologna sandwiches. We did get lightning passes and it made the lines tolerable, but only can be used once every 2 hours. Employees were not friendly and actually got yelled at trying to get a photo with the wandering Mandalorian. My build your own lightsaber was $300  for a rushed experience.  The total day was over $2000. Hotel rooms and flights took us to $5000 for a one day trip. Never again, in fact once was too much.
Now do universal. They are worse
So. Don't go there. Oh, how much were the mini ears?
We liked Universal Studios better.
Never been and never will go there!!! On purpose.
I love you man! Could you least buy me a beer for 15. and a half.
You people are effing crazy .
3:10 “ she said her favorite part of Disney was  standing in line with my family talking” Take noteparents kids just want to spend time with parents with their full attention!!You don’t have to take them to Disney to do that.
I thought parking was free
After all that money, the daughter liked standing in the lines the most and catching up with her family. It reminds of buying an expensive toy for a child and they have more fun with the gift box!
TIP-Check with employers, AARP, AAA & Credit Unions have been known to have discounts for Disney Parks.
Hey, here's a suggestion.  Stop going to Disney. Stop watching the NBA, NFL, MLB & NHL.  SEND A MESSAGE!
It’s a vacation it’s time to enjoy your money that you worked hard for If you can’t afford it, don’t go .
He's mad because he chose to spend a lot of money? Too bad.
Went years ago when my kids were young, after one day we ditched the park and long lines, went to a nearby water park and it was huge and cheap.  We had such a great time we went back again for the rest of the trip because the weather was very hot.  Outside the park they had a picnic area with tables so you could brink your food and coolers and then go right back in.  We were so glad we ditched disney.
Boy, you can tell when Ainsley Everhart got with Hannity. She sure went downhill quick I mean is she OK? Look at her
Make America great again, more like make America more expensive again. Lol
shame them, never will visit that money grabbing thievery company
I don't think $1,400 for five people is outrageous.  Did he think it would cost $200?  Come on now.
Remember a few years ago that had the Florida Pass it was about $250.00 per person my wife and I got one we lived in Tampa at that time and would go over there, we would eat before we got in and have sodas to drink when we left,  that was before they went WOKE and we stopped going
Lies from this anchor. Nothing has gotten better under this administration.  It's all worse.
It’s absolutely ridiculous it’s not the happiest place on earth, it’s a nightmare.
No sympathy from here, he should not have  been upporting such a morally bankrupt woke company. There is nothing about Disney that is just innocent fun.
Go camping, go fishing, go snow skiing, go to a park, go to the beach, for a lot less. People are dumb to go to Disney parks.
Yeah no thanks I’ll pass don’t care about Disney nothing I need to see I’d rather go on a real vacation
Disney has to try to recoup some of the losses from their woke movies that nobody wants to watch.
No sympathy,  prices are posted on the website for tickets, parking and such.
He still paid.
I wonder 🤔 what it cost 💲 to stay for a weekend on Disney property and enjoy the park?
Disney is not worth the cost of admission!!! 😢😢😢😢😢 RIP OFF!!!
The cost of everything versus waiting in line to maybe ride just a small few rides is not worth it. Also with a lot of people purchasing the lightning pass and you still have to wait you are losing out on a lot of money.
This subject needs to be brought up more! I want Fox to cover the negatives going on within this company and call out their CEO. Pressure Disney to get rid of their CEO.
I spent less on my hotel in tokyo for 12 days!
But have you said thank you once?
Whoehahaha...😂
its best to just go to Six Flags
not interested to visit
I thought the girl would say seeing dad sweat
Wow! Standing in line talking. That was free! Just like kids around the world, their favorite toy is a stick! Lol
Disney is ridiculous...The happiest place on earth  is only the happiest if you can afford it...I'd rather stay home and clip my toe nails for fun.....
Dad left in shock by CAPITALISM.
What is scary is that they've been reporting pretty high numbers the past month or two, and expect the summer season to stay pretty high as well.
Her favorite part was just standing in line and talking to her family. I have some ideas for your next day trip, try the DMV 😅
YES: THERE’s A Huge Underling $$  Problem Here‼️☝🏻.  Was there with my family @ 15 & im 57 & retired, “WAKE-UP-DISNEY”. 🇺🇸             USMC-VFW
If there were long lines, people don’t mind paying. 😂
DISNEY ALWAYS RIPS YOU OFF
Maybe  if people  stop  going  the price  will go  down.
Growing up I  always wanted to go to Disney I have 2 daughters now and still wish I could go. But I'm kind of giving up on that dream of one day being able to go
No pity for you, thats a demonic place you should know better.
The moral of the story is to not go there. But as long as the lines are long the prices won't go down.
It is real simple folks don't go. I would not go if it was free.
Why is the father taking his kids to woke Disney?
Imagine if most families could afford to go.  The lines would be miles long. Im glad i went in 2000.
Price gouging
I’d rather go camping.
My wife and i went in California. Was 125 per person. Family of four and this was 8 years ago. Never again. Disney needs to be stopped
Stop going to Disney Land
That Mickie is not a mouse he is a rat
Florida is expensive! Cal Disney much better value!
The Greediest Place on Earth
This is BEYOND insane!
disney joined the dark side 🤣🤣🤣
And that price just lets you stand in the long lines. But for more you can actually enjoy yourself.
And now they offer passes to the front for a price, appointments for rides, things have changed   I cannot imagine paying so much  for waiting in line all day.  The money drain starts with parking and food ,drinks, souvenirs will wallop you after the admission.  Seems like a punishment rather than a vacation.
What a waste of money for a company that wants to corrupt children.  Hope they did have a nice day.
Disney is just not worth it anymore.
Yeah, it’s a joke. Even the one in California. It’s a joke.
I went there for 1 day and no lightning pass and rode 4 rides, NEVER AGAIN.
I don't do Disney anything.
But did your kids have fun?  It’s about making memories.  $1,500 for a family of 5 is nothing.   You don’t have to go there every year. But if you do go don’t complain about it to the world. He just looks cheap and annoying.
That dad is SOOOO cringe.
Cant afford it dont go
This guy is priceless, his brand of therapy is relatable.
Should have already known.
44 bucks for a light Sabre! Give kid a florescent tube and tell him to be very very careful
Disney is such a ripoff
Now remember that is only 1day, try a week!!!!!!
That’s easy to fix. Stop supporting Disney!
Universal is better!   I went for 4 days with my daughter. With airfare, hotel, park tickets, fast pass, food, purchased items (shirts, jackets, Harry Potter merch, etc). was $4k for the entire trip.   Pricey, but we absolutely loved it!
If people say NO and don't go guess what happens. The prices come down duh!!! But people keep going so the prices will continue to go up up up duh!!!!! People have way more money than they have sense. Quit complaining!
Im so spirited that people are willing to spend money on such a woke for broke company
$975 for 5 tickets? And some were under 10 years old? $30 bucks just to park? What a rip off
That is ridiculous!
Only idiots go to Disney World.
I have one word for Disney RIPOFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF.
Boycott Woke Disney❗
They have to cover their cinematic flops somehow.
Went once and never again...
Ripping people off to fund their woke crappy movie failures.
I went once and it was worth it.
What is he complaining about? Did he not to any research to see what it would cost? He complains about the cost but he went any way. Typical Karen complaining what is really his choice.
Disney World is not really worth the expense now.  People could go to Dollywood, Carowinds, Six Flags, or a water park in Florida.  There are plenty of other places to spend a vacation in Florida.  A person could go to a motel in Orlando and spend time in a swimming pool.  My parents did that a few times when I was a kid.  I thought that was a vacation.
Here's a cost saving tip, stop gong to Disneyland.
Must be making up the cost of those woke crappy movies they been losing money on
I went in 79....js
It costs a lot to support DNCland. Rest assured, your money will help pay for some rainbowdwarfs transition.
Will never get any of my money boycott Disney.....
$400 Lightening Passes?!!! What a shock!
Walt is turning over in his grave. Sad days.
“It’s gotten a little bit better” with the new administration. Lol typical Fox News
No food that was just the tickets parking and park passes was $4700 for five people and you figure probably another 3000 4000 for food not counting gifts. Every time I go to Disney I drop at least 10 to 12 grand.
I don't see a problem. That fact that the girl said it was packed is proof the pricing is either just right, or even too low!
Yet it's still always packed unfortunately and if people boycott, Disney doesn't care they'll just raise prices again and for all the money you spend you cant even eat a nice meal, the food in the Anaheim Disneyland is like hospital food.
Five of us cost me $4700 for one week that was Justin that wasn’t food
Disney. A human trap set by a mouse.
Last time I was there was 1980.
Avoid going to Disney,its not worth it anymore.typicate greedy corporation.
he'll never forget it too
This isn't news or even a real reaction.  It's simply marketing for a YouTube and TikTok.  Everyone going to Disney knows exactly how much it's going to cost.  No one is surprised.  I hate these fake, social media generated "stories".  This "small business owner" makes more per month on YouTube based on subs and watch hours than I do in a year.  Good for him but stop the performative shock and disgust.
Good for him .Any conservative Dad would not take their kid to Disney Woke World.
RIGHT, WAITED TO GET TO THE TRAGIC KINGDOM TO FIND OUT AND HAS BEEN LIVING UNDER A ROCK FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS. WHATEVER YOU SAY DAD.
U gotta get the wrist band 😂
Disney is 3000 a day for 4 people  Stay there but use Lysol in room and clean it before your family comes in  Lysol really needs a can like a flea bomb . people come from all over the world there spreading diseases and germs,when we were there the ers in all hospital were infested with Canadian flu. Get the meal package cards there worth it . Take a pedometer it's 20 miles a day a ruck sack for everyone gifts they buy 🎉 it's not a real relaxing vacation never again🎉
I love how the daughter said her favorite part was waiting in line for rides because she got to talk to the family and enjoy being together. ❤
I'm sorry but I don't understand this stupidity. Disney would have to pay me to attend and even then....MAGA!!
Disney is a joke. Way too expensive. Ten years ago you could go for five days for $200 a person. Now it cost almost $200 a day per person. Season passes have ruined Disney.
Disney is no longer family friendly. The amount of pedos that work there is disgusting.
No thanks.
Have smaller families
Thinks aren't the same, no more 😕
I stop going to Disney  They are too woke to earn my $$$$$$$
Greg could afford it he’s on YouTube selling cars. I do like his YouTube channel.
I went to both Disneyland and Disney world in the early 80s and never went back!
Well Craig...you went and paid for it.
gotta tell ya I could care less what rich people do with their money. gotta spend it on something.
Last time I went my ankle got assaulted by a stroller! That was it! Haven't been back since!
WHY would you support a WOKE company???
That is outrageous!  I lived in Los Angeles in 1974 to 1976 and took my son to Disneyland once a month, it cost the two of us $20.00 (bus fare included) for the day, plus lunch at Disneyland.  How many people can afford to do that today at Disneyland or Disney World, I know I could not do it.
Don't support the Woke, Disney WMV.
My kids would rather have a pitching machine or something.
Disney is not worth the price in any way , even for us that live in Florida!
Disney has become a money pit! The cost will only go up, not down! Same goes with their Disney plus, glad I canceled them!
Could have went on vacation for that amount
You are a FOOL to spend that much money on Disney when you could have done so much more with your kids for $1k. But to each their own.
It's a no brainer.  Don't go.
A strategic tactic by Disney to keep out undesirables. True, the "protection" money is high, but at least you left unscathed.
Dizzy World cost will make your head spin.🫨
He helped fund their woke agenda even more.
Dad you are a tru HERO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I've always wanted to take my kids n grandkids but we can't afford it. It's sad normal ppl can't afford it.
And the pathetic soy wears Minnie mouse ears.
What a dmbfk to go to that vile satanic place to begin with.
A dad who loves his children shouldn't take them to Disneyland, no way. Opening your children up to the perverted ways of Disney is not godly.
My wife and I haven’t been to Disneyland since Feb 2020 and don’t plan on going back anytime soon.
It is not worth it. Highway robbery.  Take your children camping find things to do as a family, sit around a campfire. Tour caverns and natures beauty. Do a pottery class together. Fish with the kids, then cook it. Take them to the ocean rent an Rbb and build sandcastle in the sand on the beach, collect shells. So much to do that doesn't cost much money, and the kids will love it. Do small trips throughout the year. Disney is not worth the money anymore. Hasn't been for years and years. Besides they do not support family values in my opinion any longer that has been years and years too. Peace!
Not to be a debbie downer, but even a trip to the 5 County Fair is about $300 for a family of 5.  When I was in school, they would give every child a ticket to get in free, but that didn’t include rides, games or food of course. So basically you could get in, look at the farm animals and random contests like best floral arrangement or crafts.  A day at a roadway festival in town is about the same… I’m actually surprised it didn’t cost that family more.
I hope she had fun…. Since her dad is not going to be able to afford college for her 😮
You have to pay to play
I went to Disney Land in 1988   13.50 was my ticket.  I had 10 bucks to spend for the day.
For parents of young children - We took our kids to Disney about every year, awhile ago, when it was MUCH better and we always had a great time. Then one year we took them to Yellowstone and they announced that Yellowstone was as good as Disney. Just saying, they are kids. Other experiences will be just as meaningful for less money.
Back in 1997 tickets were only $30. Wow, what a change
Lady, you lie! It has got worse than ever! Lie lie lie Fox News
As a Florida resident - I won't be going to Disney any time soon, if ever. Ant not because of the outrageous cost, but that factors in.
People love paying big money to stand in line all day . Smh
I took my family to Gator Land.
I dont let my daughter watch Disney anything.  And we sure wont be visiting
Wholesome family. I’m a new dad. My parents to me and my siblings to Disney 25 years ago when we were kids. I don’t think the price is worth it these days. I remember the long lines.
Robbery and Soooooo Woke!!
disney is a capitalist wonderland.
Womp womp. So don’t go.
Went there once. That was much more than enough.  Never again.
Disney has been high for years, and even California residents are complaining about the price, + with the stuff in the background, I'm pretty sure it didn't hurt that bad. Influencer.....
Just think what foreigners think  like we rich Americans go there every weekend. When I bet a very  small % of Americans have gone.
Disney is worth it if you’re a Florida resident.
Dang! That is insane! Sorry if I am going to spend that kind of money I will go on a Caribbean cruise or resort get my monies worth.
Disney is for people of a certain station in life.  This family just barely qualifies!  I expect Disney will dramatically raise rates to shake away the low hanging fruit.
it has not gotten better since Biden
Dad is doing something right. His daughter gave an amazing answer.
I remember a time when a mouse would pull the thorn OUT of your paw.  Now it just pushes it in.
$245 at a restaurant in DS?  You got off easy.  Must have been the equivalent of McDonalds.
Ainsley Earhardt earns $3M per year from FOX, so it's difficult to see how she can empathize with people struggling to make ends meet. That goes for any of the talking heads on the news channels - liberal and conservative.
Money better invested in his children's college fund.
The reason is to offset the loss in revenue in their DEI crappy movies.
Just for elites now. Stop supporting the woke Disney leadership!
TOO expensive!!!
Woke crap boycott boycott
F Disney
Notice they also have their own small government in Disney and other abilities to run their own little city.
3:14 how is this not gonna go viral as well? the best bit was... WAITING IN THE LINES WITH ALL MY FAMILY BECAUSE I GOT TO TALK WITH THEM THE WHOLE TIME!!  You really did waste $1400 because she would be happy just talking to you!! remember that when your at work paying that $1400 off.... 🤯🤯💯
They have to make money to cover all the woke work. They went woke they deserve to go broke.
Just don't go, there are other forms of entertainment.
Been to Disney a ton. He got off cheap..
I quit disney!!! More than cost it has become Chisney Globalist Indoctrination!!! They can stay away from my family. Even Walt wouldroll in his grave to see what has happened!!!.
I grew up with Disney. Now i throw up with Disney
I haven't been to anything Disney in Decades. That is absurdly expensive.
If I ever have kids, I would take them camping and show them how to light a fire, setup a tent and share stories and enjoy each others company over a nice bbq whilst embracing nature, this consumer corporate culture is beyond disgusting and is the exact opposite way the we as a species are supposed to live.
If people would stop going, then Disney would adjust their prices. It’s all about the bottom line.
Disney theme parks: a place where people voluntarily pay over $1,000 a day to stand in one line after another, all day long, while they experience their childhood dreams slowly dying before them, and their children’s dreams too.  alternate versions:  Disneyland : the place where your cherished childhood dreams go, to pay $1000+ a day to stand in line  Disneyland: a place out of time, where the 11-year-old kids are charged full adult ticket prices and 35-year-old adults spend $1,000+ a day to act like 11-year-old children again.
Don't go, it is not the only place to have fun.
Why is he crying people just do not go there..the lines are so long that tell you how people just keep going THERE...
I have been to Disney World, and I NEVER want to go back.  EPCOT is not much more than a string of overpriced restaurants and stores, and at Magic Kingdom, you spend most of the time in line waiting for brief rides.
........make sure you stop at the bank and take out a loan before you go to the happiest place on earth, you'll need it..........
CRAIG!!!!!!
That's outrageous!  No way I would pay these prices now.
The park if fun but at that price, not sure I'd do it now.  Such a great dad and lovely daugher!
That’s what one gets when one pursues the pervert mouse.
Not worth going anymore
I notice around California Disney has not been running TV ads saying how affordable it is to visit.
So let me get this straight y’all are complaining about how an American company charges for its prices… stay home you broke mfks. Save ur money, pick a good date. Always complaining 😂
One of the reasons we do not go anymore. Have many other places to travel to and see.
Disney is no Longer Walt's Dream, it's greedy shareholders and bad CEO's.  They get rid of the best rides and add Oh, Hum rides; never added to World Showcase;....etc.  I pass on Disney every year when I'm in Florida.
Disney policy: Rich people can officially cut in line in front of you.
I’ve gotten lightning passes. The regular line was shorter.
Take your kids to Colonial Williamsburg next time. They'll have more fun and learn some history at the same time. It's way easier on your wallet also!
"We do all of these stories on people who can't afford groceries and gasoline."  Please. People who are struggling with the basics shouldn't even be considering a trip like this. The problem is, they'll go anyway. They'll throw it on credit and throw a tantrum when the interest rates jack the total cost of their $1.5k day up to $3.5k. It's not a question of "is it worth it?" Of course it isn't. But people spend money on things that are probably overvalued anyway.
And yet, people continue to go and pay those ridiculous prices!
Disney is dead now enterprises.
Disney is pure greed nowadays. Not even worth it. And I don't even agree with what they stand for anymore.
My husband thinks Disney = hell. He wouldn't go even if it was free. :D
A PERVERTED company anyways. So dont support them. Do something else.
BOYCOTT DISNEY THEY WANT MEN IN WOMENS BATHROOMS THEY HATE AMERICANS 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Just wait until he has to buy his allotted 2 dolls and five pencils per child.
Back in 2005 I took my daughter to Disney and we spent 4 days and 3 nights there. All togethet it cost me just under 3,000 dollars.....
It would help if poor people stopped going.
These parks are what is covering the losses from Disney's crap movies.
It's a deal compared to concerts and sporting events, just saying!
Not worth exposing your children to a dangerous place for children!
The crazy thing is that a family of five could take a 4-day cruise all the food included as much as they want and have a great time for about $300 per person or $1,500 let that sink in.
Well he should have researched this and he would have decided to go elsewhere.
I can find better things to do.  Disney is so leftist  it is pathetic L
You’d have to pay be to go to Disney. lol
They rob you worse than the movie theater.  Not as much as the government though.
He spent 400 bucks in the park that's pretty good to me.
30 bucks to park  omg
Why i will never go  lol
Fuk Disney  -  Go to Universal instead  !!! Plus Universal Orlando is much Better.
Never will I go there
If waiting in the lines is the FUN part you can count me out.
Disney basically financially raping families because their movies are loosing so much money the last several years
I haven't been to Disney in 25 years and a bottle of water was 5 bucks back then
$1000 for a family of 5.  No thanks. NEVER!!!!!  You want me to pay 1k to stand in line for a hour for every ride.  Hahahah that's not even a 🐀 it's a 🤡
194.80 a ticket just to walk into the park 😳 , would rather go to Las Vegas or on a cruise , or trip to the grand canyon , national parks
I went to Disney world in Orlando last year in September. It was my first visit there in 15 years that time and it was expensive because my brother and I went to two of those Disney parks and the tickets were like 200$ a person. And parking was 30$ even
The last time I went to Disney, I paid 50 dollars for a pass to all the parks. I will never go back!
So you paid 1347 to get some memories didn’t get anything worth while?  Idiot
Dude, you gotta take off that thing on your head. I can’t listen to a man wearing something like that it’s embarrassing.
And nobody can figure out why dad doesn’t enjoy his Disney trip😂
We recently went to Disney and it was over $3K just for the tickets to get into the park; what they don't tell you is that you will pay extra for the most wanted rides like Trojan or you will need to wait in lines for 2 hours; we did not stay in the park but used a hotel outside of the resorts; food definitely was expensive but we only ate one meal in the park; took snacks with us; we ate breakfast and dinner in restaurants outside the park if possible; more than likely considering the cost for everything we probably spent 6K to 7K for the four days we were at the park; my hubby and I only took the grandchildren and our selves; it was memorable and the kids had a great time. People do need to realize that the ticket to get in the park does not include many things so do your research.
Took my granddaughter never again ! I had a total different experience
GREED WORLD !
IF YOU WASTE THAT KIND OF MONEY FOR A FANTASY TRIP YOU'RE A F****** MORON 😂😂 KEEPING UP WITH THE JONESES WHEN YOU HAVE NO MONEY AT ALL
Everyone here praising Walt Disney, You all realize ol' Walt along with the cross dressing Hoover was one of the first Epstein's.
What a shame!
Well they are building a new Disney Park in the mideast. In an oil rich country.
As a Florida Man that has lived near the various parks and had gotten through multiple times, I felt fortunate with the family pass and how my grandmother took me and my cousins to Disney parks and hotels. Seeing the prices now is downright ridiculous.
anyone figure the total?
Advice to families. DON'T GO TO DISNEY. It's NOT that much fun. My parents took us to Disney and Epcot when I was a kid and I barely remember it. SPEND YOUR MONEY ON UNIVERSAL AND SEAWORLD.
Even with that precious moment in the end, that whole company caught the greedy and woke diseases and now they'll truly suffer for it.
I went to epcott last year and decided to pass on Universal because it would be another $400 for 2 😮  SHAME ON DISNEY
Why support a company that supports and gets rich off lying and degeneracy? Just stop it!
Said the place was packed… nobody cares your poor
And we thought Americans were poor and look the NBA and NHL playoffs are packed to the rafters.
Disney cost is prohibitive and then add the cost of lightning passes which doubles the cost. Eating in the park is another huge expense. The lightning passes  Don’t work well. You can’t get passes on rides that are located near each other you have to zigzag long distances through different parts of the park. People are not pleasant. It is definitely not “ The Happiest Place “.  Started going as a teenager the first year DW opened. Went there on my honeymoon. Bought a timeshare in Kissimmee and went almost yearly with my kids. Last went 2 years ago with family members including 2 young granddaughters. That was the last time I plan to go.
Dad needs to take them to the Xcaret eco-parks in the Yucatan in Mexico for a real experience. For those prices they'd experience life, nature, amazing food far away from the riff-raff at Disney parks. Get your passports.
worried about money ruins the memories
Disney is on the brink of destruction. Been going downhill for decades. Normal people don't go anymore.
Unfortunately, Disney is only for the liberal elites now, not Americans. Good riddance.
Disney sucks now igar ruined the company I won’t go back
I'm not spending a dime on Woke Disney.  Until they publicly distance themselves from the evil that Wokeism has brought America, they are dead to me.
You could go to the Caribbean for 4 days for that type of money or less.
No one we know are planning to visit Disney any more, too expensive and scary to expose your kids and grand kids to the experience
You've got an amazing girl right there dad!
This place hasnt been worth it for over a decade. More people need to boycott disney and their products and services.
TRUMP and MAGA hates Disney... so seeing this on FOX makes alot of sense
This craziness is finally exposed, I wouldn’t do that again.
Nobody forced you to go there.I wouldn't give disney a penny.Their scumbags woke Dei crap movies
Walt Disney would be so upset, he wanted Disney to be affordable! Years ago it cost $12.00 per person to get in. I guess they only want rich people to go!
Whats staggering is the pure HATRED for Veterans by Trump and his followers.  Veterans Against Trump!!!!!
Thanks for the memories Disney but later….
I wouldn't go to Disney if it was free.
Take a trip to DC next time. Everything is free other than the room & food. And the kids might actually learn something.
Trump will bring down those prices! The tariffs will help Disney.
Lolol, more videos need to happen to expose Disney's complete lack of understanding were their customers are at financially! They have lost their ever loving minds!
dang and CREDIT when it's due.. the little girl wins!!!  No one expected that answer.!  Parents are always working... never around.   Right from the kids mouth.  Time with family is hurting across America... fighting for cash.   Trying to stay afloat in this economy and regulated environment.
Cut back and just take one child. The other two can get a job in a coal mine
For starters... Super reporting Fox, good topic.  To the dad... 100% love it.  Show the new generation that it's "OK" to laugh at your self a little.  Wear the ears!!  does it hurt to wear the mouse ears?  only if you let it... the ridicule and teasing is sooooo bad out there... at what age does "pier pressure" start?  too young.  Be strong... Be yourself.... if others laugh, or ridicule it just shows how "shallow" they are.  That's a dad trying to make his daughter smile... GOOD ON YOU SIR.!! 😇🥰
SHAME ON DISNEY!! This is absolutely DISGUSTING!!!
I remember when it was $9.99 and $19.99 in the 80s. Now they're catering to people with money. I'm over 60 and it cost $350 for two in Anaheim for one day! Plus food😂
Gotta make up the L from Snow White…. Disney always WIN when People LOSE
Shut it down!  Try again.  they have perverted the whole idea.  Try again.
Disney is not worth it. Ever since Walt Disney left as leader of the company, things have just become so stupid over there.
