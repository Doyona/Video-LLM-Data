Biden pardoning all those people. They know they’re guilty
For the ignorant commentators who whine about how tight the space was in capitol ratunda, that was immature. The man was almost assassinated three times so yeah holding it indoors was the right thing to do!!!!!! also to the ignorant man who was the commentator, that boss to be you spoke of is YOUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF!!!!!! The whining is unreal……go work for Disney!
Thank you for posting this video. As I was unable to watch it during the current time of original broadcast. It's greatly appreciated! ☺️
another CEO of the demoncratic corporation......  Blessed is the day that I never have to hear "Our demoncracy" again, we are a Republic and you cannot mix the two. Also notice that they swear the oath to "The Constitution of The United States"(corporate) not "The Constitution For the United States of America" . I pray Trump changes that and the true Republic is stood up, to honor the actual people of this nation once again.
Please search Quran with English translation .Say: he is Allah the one
Why does it say 60th inauguration in the auditorium, but he's the 47th president?  I know some presidents served 2 four year terms but that doesn't sound right.

Thanks! Hope y’all over at AP for US political coverage can be more fair, honest, in the middle with not attempting to steer people one way or the other moving forward. Would love to come back to AP after a couple year break. The steering in choice of what stories where at the top, stories excluded, number of stores much too much to the left. For me, it was was too apparent and distracting. I felt being persuaded. I’ll give a look to AP again. Blessing to y’all.

A populist inauguration, rife with chants, evokes memories of Europe's dark, imperialist past. Is this the definition of making America great again? A regression to barbarism?
WE WONT GET ANOTHER TRUMP AGAIN SO IF I DONT SEE REVENGE & DEMONRATS IN JAIL IM DONE WITH VOTING
IF TRUMP LETS THE DEMONS GET AWAY WITH ALL THE CRIMES & WE SEE NO DEMONRATS IN JAIL THEN I WILL NEVER VOTE AGAIN
Boooooo
Happy days are here again!!!!!
Safer inside than outdoor ….

Really appreciate the insights in this video.
I just hope president Trump think harder before he add more taxes on foreign things. American people who owns small business has to use those items to survive . Even a lot of stuff the restaurants use comes from foreign countries. Adding taxes on those items would cause more higher food prices on grocery and restaurant menus. Yea, people don’t have to buy foreign car or electric items, but food is different.   Hope he thinks about those stuff too.
5:36:21演説
A little strange Michelle Obama wasnt there with Barack.
Congratulations President Trump.  We are praying for you.
Trump will finish everything
Informative
We are NOT a democracy, but yeh… keep on saying that. You can repeat lies all you want, it doesn’t make them true.
Greatest president ever ❤
no music with Carrie done on purpose....bs
Please President Trump stop answering so many questions to the reporters do it like Biden just walk off we don’t want to here another 4 years of questioning every day . We heard only 3 times from Biden in 4 years
Wow! What a great speech by the best President ever!
Congratulations Mr President Trump and Vice President Mr James 😊
This was a Astuning elegant prestigiosa ceremony
Felicidades a nuestro presidente Gracias a Dios por permitir una vez más que seas nuestro líder terrenal Dios está contigo amen

WELCOME BACK MR PRESIDENT
Plant a flag on Mars. Id rather sort this fcukng planet out after the mess the rich and greedy have made of it and intend to continue making. Mars my a**.Look at homelessness here you idiots.
I was definitely moved by the prayer of the 2nd pastor. I felt the power of Christ!!!
Congratulations President TRUMP,so proud of your principles.
May America install also a social security so that nobody needs to ,I've in the streets! Or in shelters where they are abused a d the children trafficked!!!!
I can’t believe you’re commenting on how long the speeches were from President Trump. Those people have been waiting. Do you think it would’ve been better if he just said a few words and walked off? I don’t think so. He’s giving the people what they want don’t you get it
5:42:13 goes so hard
Congratulations Mr. President! Sending prayers from Nigeria. 🙏🏽
Amit shah ji maafi mangiye sahara ka paisa ka jhuta vada kiya aapne .......suprim court ko jhuta sabit kiye
Lovely Gallows
Melania was so nervous that she forgot & was late to stand beside her husband with the Bible. @ 5:28:03 Joe Biden was too busy inter-acting with JD Vance's son, which held up Trump & eventually Melania & Trumps children to gather before the swearing in.
In your reports, please mention those who organized & broadcast this event behind the scenes and the musicians & singers who did an excellent job. It was brilliantly executed & showed America at its finest.
This inauguration shows shows the new world order.  Notice the number of tech bros in the front rows.  If the media had pointed out private equity & hedge funders, the picture would have been crystal clear.
fell on MLK day to remind of that WE THE PEOPLE should stand against tyranny.
🙂
We love you, President Donald J. Trump!!!!!!!   💪😎🎉🎉🎉✨️✨️🙏
Donald j Trump... I love you
The garbage has entered the White House
What is compertore in this inauguration? I couldn't find the definition in GS or ChatGPT 😀
Welcome back, President Trump. We really missed you, sir.

No more DEI, no more brain washing of our youth, no more speech police, no more green deal, no more WHO, no more open borders, no more donating trillions to terrorist nations, no more foreign drug cartels and human trafficking,  no more housing and supporting illegal criminals. I don’t see how democrats can ever win an election again.
Congratulations trump 👏 🎉🎉🎉

Hope he ban the use of Guns too, too many firearm incident
And true to form, he pardoned ALL january 6 rioters including the ones who attacked police. Nice job America!!! (oh and let me save you some time - Bidens pardon of his son was awful but not nearly as bad as pardoning people who assaulted police).
Kuddos to miss valley!
liberal tears flowed today
I'm sorry but none of those former president's are honorable. Not even one!
Are you ready to rumble. Let's go. I just cried.
Prayer in The Name of the Heavenly Father Jesus Christ over the troops and the world. Jesus have mercy, Holy Spirit.
Some overlooked big moments of the innaugural speech imo  1) Creation of DOGE  2) Creation of ERS , External Revenu Service  3) Commitment to a human future, puting humans back in the space program. Plant the stars and stripes on mars  4) Labeling Cartels as a foreign terrorist org, combatting gangs in the inner cities 5) Allocating US troops on the border  6) Taking back the Panama Canal from China 7) The dawn of a golden age
The nightmare is back. Drill baby drill till you destroy baby destroy and the Tariff BS is back again.
How is putting a flag on mars, renaming the Gulf of Mexico, and retaking the Panama Canal going to help decrease my grocery/rent/gas bill? I voted for who said they’d help with that but nothing in his speech has anything foundational to make change actually happen
Can somebody come help me find a fast food restaurant job or waitress job state AZ please ❤ -January 20, 2025

Private life let’s go!! Bring the bible back
WHY IS MELANIA HIDING HER BEAUTIFUL FACE???
Beauty and grace Melania shows the world. Yeah. I DONT CARE DO YOU coat. She couldnt even dress a Christmas Tree without moaning. 😂
You didn't see the hand-off or presidential traditions because of Jan 6. Trump has endured so much, but he made it because he's strong 💪
Can’t wait to have my rights stripped away from me and to embrace bigotry and fascism. This should be… great.
Today is finally here nomore biden and harris

Make English the official language of the United States!!

Goodbye lunacy, hello America
I love AP at least it keeps the most neutral view on US
Great transition of power.
8:22:41 That salute from Elon Musk is just crazy 😬
What a great day! However, I was disappointed by the crowds' reaction to the young people performing at the parade. It bugged me to see front-row people barely giving a single clap for these performers. You know these kids worked their butts off to get here.
5:28:45 Trump taking the oath of office.
R.I.P. Joe Biden's political career  January 3, 1973 - January 20, 2025

congratulations Mr. president trump and gorgeous first lady Melania 🙏❤️
Golden age of america just began ❤
Please Mr. President, help the USA but also I live in Sweden and my electric bill is $600-$900 a month because we rely on those BS windmills and have shut down our nuclear plants.  I'm only working part time and to receive a $900 bill is so stressful!  Have to rely on my poor 77 year old mother on SS for me and my teenage son to eat!!
Love you Marjorie Taylor Greene thank you for all you did to help my president Trump
Hey thank you Marjorie Taylor Greene

It's time to clean house folks... Let's make America great again....
gta 6 with trump >>>>>>>>>>
"BECAUSE YOU EARNED A 𝘿𝘼𝙍𝙆 𝘼𝙂𝙀, YOU MAY MAKE ONE DEDICATION." Do you think Trump chose "Heartbeat of Steam" or "To Arms!"?
The lady talking sounds so miserable lol
Does anyone know what time the ball will be and what channel will be on?
Not a huge fan of Trump but the American people had made their votes. Let’s just hope our new president lives up to his promises and keep this country United instead of divided.
Wow what a beautiful day for trump
In other news: Biden announced today that he is ready for the second debate with Trump.
Why is the flag half mast?

BIDEN / HARRIS YOU ARE FIRED!!!!
If My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.    II Chronicles 7:16
Trump 2025 the almost kiss to his wifey was pure genius 😂
Why did White House get dark?
Damien Thorne just became President.
It's all a show folks...a distraction. Watch the dictator now take over....you fools that voted him in...and supported him.
Congratulations, Mr. President Trump. This is a significant achievement and a testament to your expertise and achievements. Best wishes ahead 👏 😊❤
6:01:56 Unironically one of the hardest quotes I have every heard.
Congratulations to President Trump.  It will be interesting to see if he actually does anything during this, his last term, because he did nothing in his first term apart from alienate everyone and talk a lot of hot air. I really do hope he delivers on what he said whilst running during the election.
The settings and music look like crowning of a king!
12 hours long?! These people have lost their minds. No wonder there is only 43 comments. People realized how long it was and went to watch it somewhere else.
3:40:20  Anyone else notice the black man is still polishing the white man's shoes 🤭
Luckily he can’t run next time
Welcome back dear Trump ,make country better again,
5:28:43 this is what people are there for
Congratulations Mr President & welcome back
Congratulations Mr President🎉
Like Trump or Hate him.. I'm just happy having a President that can complete an entire sentence.
Ok, what are we talking about? The Panama Canal uses the Balboa to the US dollar. Greenland uses the Danish Krone.  Canada, the Canadian Dollar (Loonies) depicted on the coin. Mr. Trump, when you get Balkroonies started, at the Mint, call me.  You are a Real Estate Investor. If the Constitution is a living breathing entity. We the People, the forgotten people, are gonna hold you to it.
AMEN!
What a wonderful day.
"all the world is a stage"  Dana white next to obama? were definitely in some kind of parallel reality
What an Explosive inauguration Trump is a legend
We are NOT a Democracy. We are a CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC.
He did it !
Why is it about "winning" :/ It's why I can't trust anyone
Step up, Luigi
