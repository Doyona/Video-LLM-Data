Can’t believe the American Airlines were so poorly represented however they get the review they deserved I would not pay for premium first class with that kind of amenities, seating and service
Hawaiian & Jet blue products are really first class products but business class products
YOOO
I beg you to stop removing your seatbelt in-flight. The seatbelt sign is turned off so that you can use the lavatory or retrieve items from the overhead, but you should have your seat belt fastened whenever you are seated.  Turbulence can strike at anytime and without warning -- causing severe injury and even death.  PLEASE, PLEASE encourage your viewers to keep their seat belts fastened at all time.  You should lead by example.  We wouldn't want to lose you.
Yes, this video was a year old, but I've been binge watching, and I'm  exhausted for you
National and international flights aren't the same.  Delta will have an obvious advantage.
I just think it’s nasty that they don’t clean the space a little bit before the next people come in. I know there are quick turnovers but still gross. You pay all that money for first class and and you have to put clear away your own food tray. Not exactly first class service.
So to conclude, US airlines are dirty. For the price is inexcusable
You need to check your health man, consuming all those unhealthy plane and hotel food. 😊
13:09 hahaha Iron Man, classic! 😂😂😂
12:57 I've been wondering about this. You have to return the B&O headphone? So in your previous flights all the amenities in first class are yours? You can take it with you?
I have seen the flying to 7 continents video and the asian airliners were insanely exclusive compared to USA first class airliners.
Out of curiosity, I looked up the prices for Sterling Pacific. The cheapest one is currently $1950
United seats are better, but Delta service and food is always superior
Coming a little late to this party. I have flown 2,000,000 miles with American so that’s all I can speak to, but I can do so with a bit of fluency. From my experience, Will, the preflight drink is almost entirely at the discretion of the flight attendant: some serve one and some don’t. There’s nothing really standard and I can’t tell when it is “normal” for them to do so or not do so.  Ithink is safe or fair to say: the best flight attendants can make get customers a preflight drink (of at least orange juice or water if time is short) or an apology if there is (truly a genuine/rare) reason it can’t be done before take-off.
Well it's good to know if travelling first class,never book an american carrier
these are not first class. they are business seats, USA airlines got no first class. Americans don't deserve good shit
Should have been like a 6 7
What brand of backpack does he use in this video?
#1761
Delta wins for me but in general I found FC terrible compared to other world airlines. Just the idea to paying that difference but being stuck with the same claustrophobic and dirty toilets is madness!!!
That JetBlue First Class was awful!
For the UA Flt HNL - ORD, was there two meal services or only one?
Quick question, how did you get TSA Pre as a Brit? I looked into it briefly last time I was travelling for work but it seemed like there were lots of hoops to jump through due to not having US citizenship
I’ve been on Delta one B767 and A350
US airlines are the cheapest quality
Sparkling water 😮 so wrong, it should have been champagne, of the very best !!
Yes he flamed them but in other countries you fly first class if your rich but in America they fly private
As usual the US airlines are worse than any other first class, Delta looked ok though. European Airlines, Arab Airlines and Asian airlines are just so much better.
next he should do middle eastern carriers
What a help your ground staff were
How American of you to wear white sneakers.  I guess the Tims were too fancy for US arilines.
Most people take planes to get to the destination, but you take planes for the journey. 6 back to back flights, not staying at any of the places. Lol
18:44 Does anyone know what he said here??
Nothing beats a jetBLUE holiday!
Most of that food looks like shite - hope it tasted as fab as you claimed.  I'm guessing First Class on US flights is a distance behind international flights.  When I got off a SYD-SFO economy flight with free alcohol and meals, I remember the US domestic flight being handed a tiny snack pack of some crap junk food with a few peanuts or such, then a can of soda she didn't let go of as I tried to take it, until I realised she expected me to pay for the drink - ugh !  Just one reason apart from the now obvious, why I have no intention to visit the US until at least after Nov 2028. ⛑🪓
One thing I will say is I’m probably very nice to United because I just love the airline but he did not even close to some of the experiences I’ve had on United. He got a very bad experience. I’ve had it before not super expensive but they did me a menu and they roll out a ice cream sundae cart with lots of options his experience was very horrible and I feel sorry for him, but he shouldn’t grill united because he wasn’t on the newer planes
I only go on alaska, so i thought it was completely normal to not have a tv and thought it what every airline did.
Delta being 2300 for an international flight like that seems to be the winner. And Hawaiian for 2800!?!? Just because its a 787?
I lived in Hawaii for three years while stationed with the military, and Daniel K. Inouye airport is absolutely beautiful. One of the best airports I’ve ever passed through
You do realize that Delta and Spirit are the ones that made the industry the way it is now right? Them and Spirit brought all the negative changes in the US.  Dynamic award ticket pricing? Delta introduced that. Buy on board meals? Delta introduced that. Basic Economy? Delta and Spirit introduced that. Basic Business? Soon it’s gonna be on every US airline thanks to Delta introducing it here in the US. Spend requirements for loyalty? Delta initially introduced that. Earning miles by dollars spent instead of miles flown? Delta introduced that.  Delta thinking of themselves as a “premium carrier” is a load of bullshit
There looks to be a huge difference between some of the carriers even though it’s supposedly the same class.
What about South West
Wow compared the European airlines US airlines are absolute garbage. It’s wild you had to make your bed every time 🤯
I don’t know if it’s only on newer aircraft, but my Hawaiian Airlines flight had free starlink WiFi last July.
I like it, but the only letdown part is the fact that you took the Delta flight from Seattle to Heathrow at the end when I kinda expected somewhere like JFK, based on the way you've taken the domestic first class journey throughout the video. No offense.  (Btw, if you did take SEA-LHR on Delta, then you could've started the journey with LHR-JFK on AA)
Amazing
Your speaking cadence and intonation is really strange for a Brit. It’s pretty distracting but this is my first intro to you and I love your videos so I’m not entirely sure what my point is haha
If they're back to back flights, why do the suitcases keep changing. I find it very distracting lol.
I’m watching this like it’ll be anything like my upcoming trip in 36E😵‍💫😵‍💫
I will say while Alaska doesn't have any kinda suite first class, what they offer is still pretty good especially for those long flights. Flew them for an 6 hour flight from Anchorage to Chicago I do believe on the way home. The only time I ever flew first class and it was a great expierence. Tbh, even Spirit's premium seats are nice. Also done Delta Premium once.
Hmmm I wonder who won..
Have had terrible service with United this summer
Delta definitely cleared
Bro I crave them delta cookies
On JetBlue it’s called Business Class and the economy is called Core
America, we needs to step our game!!
Delta
Think all the prices check out with what you got. Going to Hawaii is just pricier all the way around
Professional complainer. Btw it's assumed in America that as an adult you can handle holding a button down to fold your seat. If you asl the crew they'll assume your a child or you've always been treated as one.
Tek Trendy yuo hahahhahahahahahahahahahaahhahaah😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I had a Norfolk VA trip to Chicago to Phoenix trip years ago.  I have a PTSD from that. I call them STUpided.   They are poor everything.  Now my favorite for my generally cheap flights US was Delta. They were just super as they treated us all like we were special. They realize flying is still a luxury no matter how short the trip.
southwest?
I would avoid American everything like the plague.
The suit case Costs £73737373747373733773738383833838383838383883388
US airlines have all gone to garbage
Not one of the 1st class seats was as good as Qatar business class nor the secice
Delta has fallen off so hard it's so sad
You forgot spirit first class
Damn.  Some phenomenal, some average..one United.  Keep up the good work, Will.
Rich Brit’s are spoiled brats because why did he call the Hawaiian airlines croissant rock hard but he was able to rip it like regular bread. Feels very uppity
Always using Delta :)
Now do eco
seems to be the US domestic flights are all 💩
Someday, I'd like to be on a first class flight that doesn't look like the Alaskian flight.
just rlly finding your channel now, and i love this kinda stuff, AND I LOVE YOUR ACCOUNT! lots of love bro keep it up ❤️
I mean lots of hate for JetBlue but thats the only US fight you can take that can even be considered "first class" outside of the US
No love for Spirit I see...
Comparing domestic and international services hardly seems fair. As well as short and long haul services. Curious why you never pre-ordered meals on airlines like United so you would have at least a better idea of what you are getting. Good video over all just think the comparisons could’ve been a bit more level.
Just wondering why you took a huge suitcase if you just went from airport to airport to airport was it to see if they lose your luggage?
our family has trusted Delta since my childhood. Great flights
I’m a US Citizen, and it’s embarrassing how poor our air travel is.
Glad to see horrible security experiences at Seattle-Tacoma are universal!
What brand is the silver carry-on suitcase?
Trek ur goated
I don’t see the point of first class or business class for anyone. Having those options is like telling others who can’t afford those upgrades that they are less important then those that fly first and business class. I would have rather had a parachute for each person under every seat. Everyone should also be offered good food just just those classes. That is what’s wrong with the world. You got everyone feeling if you have more money then that makes you better then everyone else.
Delta😊
United is the absolute worst airline. Their attitude is sooooo rude. Makes me wonder if potential applicants have to pass a rudeness test to be employed at United.
I have flown with all of those airlines. While Alaska used to be top notch with real flatware, glassware, ceramic plates, coffee cups and saucers even in coach, it’s degraded itself in cost cutting measures. They hadn’t offered real hot meals in ages to coach. Hawaiian was good in the 80s. American was so-so. Delta was the most memorable with a hot meal, fine serve ware, free movies, blankets, pillows and flight attendants were all quite attentive.
USA based airlines are such a joke when it comes to first class passenger accommodations as compared to foreign airlines.
Alaska had no tv’s?   Not to mention United’s poor service
Our airlines look like crap compared to the other ones you've shown.
Sir, what cabin bag are you using?
Delta has not disappointed yet. The staff are amazing and the flight has always been smooth. I rather liked the cheesy Delta adverts about the company. There is a genuine pride that Delta has. I would choose them every time should the option arise.
That looks like fun I travel every year and I’m just 14 I only flown on 2 airlines and I’m going on American Airlines for the first time in August so the video really helped so I can learn more about the different airlines
I remember luggage commercials that had a gorilla throwing around their suitcases to show durability 🤣🤣🥰👍
San Francisco  New York Los angeles Hawaii Chicago  UK Are the locations
the delta one isnt all that fair because the rest of the flights we're all domestic
