genuine question why are stadiums half empty for this match?
Drop shot at 1:39 might be the best dropper I've ever seen.
surprised anyone watches Mens Tennis
It’s crazy you can get this far in a grand slam without hitting a backhand with any direction. I mean my god. Every back hand he hit was short to alcaraz forehand
Who designs these silly Tsisipas getups ??  Surprised he agreed to wear it
Alcaraz hits ball.......... several hours later....... EEEUUUUEEEEEHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!
Sinner is the title holder for this season no doubt!
May our creator protect this young player. He is consistent in defying and progressing this amazing game Alcaraz is a phenomenal tennis player especially for this generation. 🙏🏽
It's gonna be alkaraz and zverev in the final i think
Alcaraz grunt less, it's annoying.
Battle of the Charlie Browns....what's with the threads
Alcaraz's forehand is so powerful, Spain might consider using it to power their wind turbines!
Looks like Tsitsipas discovered that Alcaraz is faster than a Greek salad disappearing at a family dinner! Best wishes against Sinner.
SORRY Tsistsipas....you need to fire your silver fox daddy!!😂😂
3 min?? These need to be at least 7-8 min.
Jawohl Schwärzler 😊👍🇦🇹
Sinner and Alcaraz it will be  Roger and Nadal match. It will be epic
Janik k saamne aane do sab hawa nikal jaaygi 😂
2:25 That Vamos
These highlights are way too short
Why Alcaraz Garfia yelling ? It seem disrespectful ..
Alcaraz grunts just way too much ..
Dropshot matchpoint is absolutely crazy
The top spin monstrous forehand is so lethal against a one hander 😔
stef has such a solid backhand man. You watch Carlos targeting it and it changes nothing! His returns are key here. With that said, Alcaraz level is too good Vamo!
Let's Go Carlos Alcaraz 👏👏👏
what a crappy job selecting these highlights...
Alcaraz looking back to make sure Tsistsipas apologized after that overhead 😂😂
New husband for Roland garros
Alcaraz vs Bumblebee
I like Sini. 😎
Carlitos showed his jerk side 😅
🙌🙌
Alcaraz is the bestt on clay right now really hope he beats Sinner
Vamos Carlito!!!
THis is Carlitos' tournament. He'll beat Sinner in 4
For whoever it's possible, I'll really recommend don't watch here... Sony has uploaded on Sony LIV, with a longer, 10min version of all of these RG matches.
Jawohl Zeballos und Granollers 😊👍
I'm sure you didn't notice it, especially since you don't speak Greek, but I do, and in the 3rd set, when Tsitsipas was 3-2 games ahead, he turned to his father (who is also his coach, as you know) and told him "You're worthless, you're trash" (I guess because he was giving him instructions that weren't working out for him).  That's typical Tsitsipas for you...
Alzaraz's grunting is worse than most women's. He is such a kitten.
Si Tsitsipas estuviera más concentrado sería uno de los grandes, tiene mucho talento y lo está desperdiciando.
Alcapies campeón
Sinner vs alcaraz is virtual final
Would be great to have highlights longer than 3 minutes…
Washed
no te regalan nada y asi avanzas.
Carlitos makes Stefanos' single BH look hapless.
Tsitsipas father Apostle 1 is still talking to him ,how to play the next point ,sorry Apostle1 the games over, save your breadth.
Lucky Djokovic retired he would have no chance against sinner or Alcaraz .
too much voodoo on the court.
Carlitos Alcaraz the almighty Spaniard is  back again..
when the top 5 players play against each other the game somewhat becomes predictable!! the top players have either a little bit more speed or topspin or quick forehand strokes or the ability to play that one extra shot apart from being well rounded in all other departments.   In this case Alcaraz is just quicker and good shots against him aren't effective enough.
I’ve never rated Tsitsipas; he was literally only great for one year (2021) but otherwise he’s a wasted talent. Thank god for Alcaraz and Sinner saving tennis and showing us how real champions play!
Tsitspas, in press conference first said Vudu, lol, Its Melitonin or vudu, grunting, lol, Then He said the kids is just to good and His tennis IQ is great..., I say Tsitsipas get a real Coach and work on Your back hand return and some other skills, So You sir might be able to compete with Carlos and Sinner....
The reason this is such a bad matchup for Tsitsipas is that everything he does really well, Alcaraz does BETTER! And on top of that, Alcaraz has a strong bh and killer drop shots from both wings, which Tsitsipas does not have
The moment the crowd started to raise their arms and didn't stop, even the official referee started to smile... it was super funny😂😂😂
Please at least another video for "Extended Highlights". Those recaps are very very bad...
Every since that choke session against Novak in that French  final I never thought Tsisi would ever win a GS and now that new guys have emerged I don’t think he ever will good guy just doesn’t have enough
Stefanos You should change your coach to improve  Good Luck 👍
アルスズメは王者のメンタリティー
seemed the great power difference
Emirates needs to stick to planes cause they stink at making highlights.
Alcaraz grunts before he hits the ball????
Ha Carlos targeted Stefanos backhand  Got a weak response  And utilize it to win.
Glückwunsch Ruud 🥎 schade bitter für Djokovic 😢
didn't take enough toilet breaks
Another quarter-final showdown and another 3 straight set glory from Carlitos. Massive congratulations!
Believe it or not as but as long as Tsitsipas is coached by his father,he'll never win any major slam
Carlos Alkaras pazar günü kupayı havaya kaldırır.
How many comments of "Please don't make the thumbnail a spoiler of the result" do you think it will take for the FO media team to notice and respond to?
Tsitsi backhand is painful to watch, sorry to say, but not even top 50 quality.
Grande Carlitos!!!
There's no chance for Tsitsipas. He is not focus and he is too busy with his highly publicized relationship with Badosa. Alcaraz already knows his game.
what I don't understand, with Novaks retirement there seems to be one player missing? Where am I wrong?
Tsitsipas is so weak in front of Carlos. 🙄
STEFANOS TSITSIPAS 🇬🇷 ONLY
Tsitsipas vs. Alcaraz is like Roddick vs. Federer
Alcaraz is going to win this thing, he's unstoppable.
We need 10 minutes of highlights🗣🗣🗣
Dopecaraz as always running effortlessly and reaching every ball without ever getting tired 😂😂
Alcaraz sounds like Sabalenka
This is pretty much what Michael Chang did to Lendl back in 1989. Topspin moonballs to Lendl backhands.   One handed backhand is pretty but it's a recipe for disaster if you play against players who can manipulate moonballing at slower speed
Watch out Sinner is going to kick your but my friend. Just guessing. Love from Afrika
Stefanos backhand is weakness against top players
Stefs problems v Carlos are mostly tactical. Plays too short into hitting zone and shot selection sometimes shockingly bad at this level…
Bravo, Carlos ❤
Topspin to the backhand took Tsistispas out of rhythm. He couldn't be offensive
Who do you guys think is going to win? Sinner or Alcaraz?
For a top 10 guy, Tsitipas probably has one of weakest backhands I've seen. If he can't improve upon it, I don't see him winning any Slams.
alcaraz...will be the RG champ🏆
I think sinner and Alcaraz wear each other out and Ruud wins a 5 set thriller to win the title
Tsitsipas with his looks I see as the best looking player presently. A personal favourite. Can come up with some amazing shots too. Alcaraz is playing at a tremendous level where it seems that the semis between him and Sinner is no less than any GS final!
Hola,Vamos Carlos a por ello ya estas cerca de llegar al final animo Palmar🎉❤‼️
❤❤❤❤
wow.....what a wonderful match by both outrageous players!
Stephanos outfit looks like wolverine!
Bravo Alcaraz! Once again you gave a lesson!
Что этот карась так выстёбываетса 😂
I watched just about 30-35 minutes of the match, and in that amount of time, it had more hghlihgts than this video covering the entire match...
I already said 2 days ago, alcaraz will destroy sinner like last year
tsitsipas serve game against alcaraz was crazy good...but alcaraz did it better
yo where tha frenchies at
Alcaeaz has become a literal nightmare for Pissypas. He can't even take a set on his favourite surface.
Tsitsipas has the capacity and tqlent to be more competitive. We'll see if it happens. Ever since Badosa he's tanked
Tsitsipas winning a Slam is too hard.
I'm surprised that the crowd applauded instead of booing both of them.
Carlos Alcaraz: proud father of Stefanos Tsitsipas
And it's not like Tsitsipas played badly.
5 down 2 to go  Qtr final  Carlos wins 6-3,7-6,6-4  Good  performance  3 aces  1 DF 1st serves in 73% 1st serve win 74% 2nd serve win 74% Break point 4/6 67% 27 winners  21 UE
I knew it would be an Alcaraz Vs Sinner semis. Tstitspas nor Dimitrov have the skill to beat these two. Now that Novak has retired, 202r FO champ will be either Sinner or Alcaraz. I might say Zverev has a small chance.
I actually feel that Alcaraz was a better player 1-2 years ago. I feel he's become more rigid and less dynamic or versatile in some ways, and may be a bit more predictable. But I could be wrong.
Stick with the 3 minute highlights RG …….. they are so popular
If Alcaraz loses in the finals, he would say his arm is hurting...another alibi coming! lol
Wow.
Alcaraz is simply amazing! An honour to watch him play! What a great and exciting time for tennis!
I think the match against SInner will be tight and tough. Carlos is not at his peak level so far
Sinner make the two "best" player like small children...
That's tough for stephanos
After this match you cant convince me Tsitsipas has some jealous resentment towards Alcaraz.
Alcaraz  screaming is annoying.. he doesn't need to do that he is good enough, and he started doing even more lough after ... bad sportsmanship
The alcaraz forehand prep is so scary cuz you wouldnt know if he will do a dropshot or a strong down the line winner
Zverev will win french open 2024
Alcaraz❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥇🏆
OK this one  doesn't need a extended highlights
Alcaraz was totally dictating tsitsipas.... Tactical wise there were some improvements but given the form he is in  stef should have won n also having said that alcaraz is not at his best as well.... Sad for tsitsipas...
What a high level. Great play from both of them, But Carlos is just too strong right now for Stef. And it's not as if Stef is in bad shape. His recent form has been excellent.
To think Tsitsipas was at one point the heir apparent to the big 3. The world is a cruel place.
crowds looove alcaraz !!!
Whoever wins wins. Win or lose, Sinner is still #1 in ranking.
Too bad Tatsipas has been in good form lately esp in this tourney, rough matchup, thought he would come back with winning second set. Good match and nice win for Carlos.
the sponsor box near the net has to be removed
Stefanos should have forfeited singles instead of the mixed
Carlos is getting smarter and more tactical out there. Not focused on pleasing the crowd, now focused on winning. This is a good direction. Juan Carlos is legit a good anchor for this boy
Sinnervs alcaraz reminds me of the novak vs nadal rivalry
Alcaraz vs. Tsitsipas h2h 6:0, that's rough man
Carlos is his father
Tsitsipas has had to accept that he probably will never win a Grand Slam if either Alcaraz or Sinner is in the tournament.
Is his grunt extended?
Zizipass again a other disapointment
today was exhibit A on why the 1-handed backhand is dead
This was unexpected. Straight sets victory.
Federer vs Alcaraz ?
Clearly the weakness of tsitsipas is his backhand
The commentators were just ripping on tsistpas’s backhand just because he hits a one hander. Going to discourage younger generation to ever want to have a one hander.
He's never gonna beat Carlos 😂
Tsitispas was so inconsistent today and felt like he gave up a bit earlier.
Tsitsipas lost as soon as he stepped onto the court
Crazy how bad Tsitsi backhand is
Sineer vs carloa my fav
Vamos Carlitos....
Stefanos hit a smash right at him??? 2:14
No way novak would have stood a chance agaisnt Carlos
Next time, please try not show an image of the winner celebrating on the video for those of us who do not know who won and want to enjoy the video not knowing until the end
She said second set Alcaraz when he won the third one😂
So whole tiebreak in second set is not even a highlight not even a one point? Amaizing job as always but i think 3 minutes is too long for grand slam, cut it to just pictures of set results
Alcaraz got of of jail
Nightmare matchup for Tsitsipas
Bye bye cocky player
Carlos will party all night to celebrate the victory and be off in the next match. Haha. He's great entertainment. Thank you.
Anyone know what Tsitsipas was frustrated about during the second set tiebreak?  I had the audio off at that time.
Tough draw for Stephanos
Wonderful match.
If the desire is for Americans to engage with the French Open, then, due to the time change, give us actual highlights. This is FAR too cursory. I am at work when these games are on. Give us the actual story you lazy goofs.
Can you imagine McEnroe, Sampras, even Federer celebrating after every point. No..
Tsitsipas need to up his IQ Tennis wise, he's really lacking physically and mentally, he looks spent.
They didn’t even show the moment in 2nd set tie breaker when Sassy in his typical childish behaviour starts complaining about the “extended grunts” from Carlos implying that he is intentionally distracting him. Carlos does cheekily smiles though 😈
Professional performance from Alcaraz
The unfortunate fact that a one hander will tend to break down after a constant barrage, especially on clay. Exhibit Tsitsipas &  Dimitrov
Alcaraz just too good.  Sinner is next
I just know I’ll be very pissed on Friday if I can’t watch this match live if they play Sinner Alcaraz while I’m at work.
Tsitsipas looked absolutely lost out there today. Especially the beginning of the second set. I thought he finally got going when he got the break back and made it to a tiebreak, but alas. Carlos has his number 6-0 h2h.
The YouTube team for the French Open is as considerate of its clientele as French waiters.
Tsitsipas has amazing topspin on clay against mortals, but alcaraz crushes the ball and is able to reach hard balls like no other, his physicality on clay i think will beat sinner, if not now, on the long run.
I'm no expert, but i believed this match will go to wire congratulations Alcaraz getting to semis
Anyone one still in the draw (except Zverev) wins the title world be great
Congrats Alcaraz on a straight set win.   Hopefully it’ll be a great semi final between Alcaraz and Sinner.
Congrats Alcaraz on a straight set win.   Hopefully it’ll be a great semi final between Alcaraz and Sinner.
Spoiler thumbnail and a 3 minute highlight, lol what a joke.
Tsitsipas is chid play.
Lets make Alcaraz & Sinner head to head in the finals!!!!! 😊
Sweet ending😂😂
These 3 minute highlights are a disgrace to tennis fans and France…
Tsitsipas lost to drop shots on match point twice in grand slams😂
No worries Stefanos go win the doubles!!😆
Tsisipas was playing very well, and he went through him in straight. It's going to be very interesting against Sinner, both are playing well.
The French don't know how to do highlights on YouTube. Worst slam out of the 4.
Alcaraz is unstopabble
I was hoping Tsitsipas to win.
too short
Carlos Alcaraz (20) & Jannik Sinner (22) two brilliant young players ever
Tsitsipas backhand on clay seems weak. Puts very little pressure on the opponent. Mostly a defensive shot. Very few winners.
Why is Tsitsipas STILL SO AWFUL at recognizing / reacting to / handling drop shots? Why hasn't he learned since they cost him so many big matches, including the FO 2021 final?
No player on the tour can hurt Sissy's fragile pride (and of course fragile backhand) like Alcaraz. Now that Joker is gone, either him, Sinner or Zverev seems to be a sure thing.
Im starting to warm up with Alcaraz but I watch his matches with sound off...his incessant grunting is as bad as Sharapova.
Zverev will take RG. 4-1 h2h against sinner, winning last 4.
Charlie marsvilhoso! ❤
2:16 flashbacks from previous match but luckily stef apologised
I love Tsitsipas now. Very calm...
1:40 Get out of here. The angle on that volley is insane.
My theory that whoever pays most attention to ball kid during entrance (holds hand entire time, talks to them, etc) wins the match continues to hold up!!
pas de chance pour tsitsipas de tomber sur un tel joueur , je le voyais aller au bout ! mais carlito va surement gagner cette année pour moi il est meilleur que sinner sur cette surface ! d'ailleurs quand il est à 100% il est meilleur que n'importe qui n'importe ou ! son soucis, c'est d'étre à 100% !! méfiance envers ruud tout de meme
Alcaraz seemed way too comfortable with this match up... I mean if it comes down to it... He could always just target that tsitisipas backhand for easy points...
Roland Garros is the absolute worst out of all 4 majors in posting highlights. Way too short and skips over important points. Please do better
Alcaraz needs to stop the loud moaning, otherwise it was a great match!
You got to feel really bad for Tsitsipas. His facial expression, body language, and demeanor all throughout the tournament suggested that he thought himself to be the Roland Garros champion. Rafa 2.0 reincarnated.   Alcaraz knocked the living daylights out of Tsitsis inflated ego and brought him down to earth real fast. Well, at least he can relax in Mykonos with his arm candy, Badosa. Don't feel that bad now for him :-).
Tsitsipas has a very flat and ineffective one-handed backhand against Alcaraz, he should really consider playing the two-handed backhand, Alcaraz is uncomfortable with balls with a certain bounce and spin
I'm calling it now: the kryptonite to modern tennis is the flat stroke.
Wow, that was really convincing.  Alcaraz accuracy when he needs to hit big points is insane.
I wish i was born in a timeline where a prime Federer, Rafa, Djokovic, Sinner, Alcaraz, Murray, Wawrinka and Thiem were competing for slams. It will be every Tennis fans wet dream.
Stefanos down in straight sets. Couldn’t have asked for a better ending to my day!
Alcaraz-Sinner, Let's go!!! 🤯
Tsitsipas has played very easy against Alcaraz, that is why he has only had two break points when Alcaraz's serve is not his strong point
Not even the grunt?
Alcaraz is a true tennis prodigy! A once in a generation player.   After Federer, he is the only player (in contention for multiple slams) who seems like he's having fun out there, but at the same time beating the best players. Only a supremely talented person in their respective craft can do that. A player who makes the game look easy and joyous.   I wish him a long , fruitful tennis career.
Tsitsipas is excited to see Wolverine in the new Deadpool movie
Tsitsipas choke again 😂
Vamos pra cima lobo 🚀🇧🇷🇧🇷
Alcaraz was right when he said that he is very comfortable playing Tsitsipas and has the "key" to Tsitsipas game. More of the same from Tsitsipas and that key will work every time. Tsitsipas needs to find ways and approaches with Alcaraz. You can see that Alcaraz has almost a sadistic hold on Tsitsipas game and he really likes to show that he can defeat him (easily) every time he plays him. He gets a bigger 'high" from defeating Tsitsipas than any other player. And so far, Tsitsipas has no solid answers. No matter how good Tsitsipas plays, Alcaraz makes it seem like its not good enough. Kind of ridiculing him and his game. Hence that is why he has owned their head to head meetings, never loosing once to him.  Djokovic, Medvedev, and more recently Jarry have this un-relentless hold on Tsitsipas and his game, maybe a little less than Alcaraz but it is still there. Tsitsipas needs to go back and look at this match in its entirety and come up with some remedy to the Alcaraz choke hold. No more praise or admiration from Tsitsipas. It's time he toughens up and find a way to win. If not, Alcaraz will always own him and his game unfortunately.
Djokovic must be kicking himself and cursing his injured knee. This was a golden opportunity for him to secure his 25th slam.   Alcaraz and Sinner are going to wear the hell out of each other in the semis. And Djokovic, if he had met either in the finals, is a master of wearing players down and taking their legs. Missed opportunity.
Single handed backhand can never beat sinner or alcaraz it’s a weak point
Stefanos was one of the favorites and played some electrifying tennis so far at RG. Alcaraz completely decimated him. It wasn't even the same level. Scary.
Nice highlights.lol .good to see that you put a couple Alcaraz points in there
21 unforced errors in 2 hrs 15 mins in a match where tsitsipas did 33 unforced errors, isn't really good by carlos, this is where he will lose against sinner or zverev, sinner zverev are toughest carlos oppents ever
3 mins seriously!!!!
Tsitsipas has seemingly matured a lot, atleast outwardly. But it took a player of the class of Alcaraz to bring out the Greeks ugly side today-- poor Tsitsi atleast he can go cry in Badosas arms.
Grunting is annoyinng
There is a history of bad blood between these two players, but I don't think that Stefanos was trying to hit Carlos on that overhead. It appeared to me that he changed his shot placement when he saw Carlos running to cover the ad-side and tried to go behind him instead. Carlos did give him quite a stare, though lol.
What on earth was Tsitsipas wearing? He deserved the beat down just for that‼🤔
Carlos has peaked at right time!!!
Sinner made Dimitrov seem like an amateur player, and Alcaraz does the same to Tsitsipas. And,Tsitsipas himself was brilliant throughout the tournament and one of the favorites.  The level Alcaraz displayed today was extraordinary, I've only seen Rafa display such brutal dominance at Roland Garros.
Masterful performance from King Carlos!
I just hope both carlos and sinner bring their A game to the semi. And from what everyone has seen so far, very much a possibility. May the best player on the day win.
Carlos is just a better player than Stef. It seems like the only way Stef is gonna win a slam is if all the  top guns got out early. He beats who he's supposed to but struggles against the elite
Alcaraz v Sinner should’ve been the final.
It's a massive pity that Sinner-Alcaraz is playing in the semis. It should have been the finals! These two have been the most dominant players in the tournament so far.  My prediction (praying it doesn't come true). Sinner is going to take the legs of Alcaraz in a brutal 5 setter, but the Spaniard will prevail. Ruud will play an exhausted Alcaraz in the final and win his first and possibly only slam.
I have impression these guys are not mature, Children pretending to be tenis players.
Every game is a natural highlighter
I hope he or Sinner takes it this year.  They will probably face Zverev in the final.
Carlos is the most cerebral player in tennis.
Get use to Sinner and Alcaraz being in the finals
humbling tsitsipas is a greater achievement than winning the tournament
What a rivalry between Sinner and Alcaraz. Head to head, 4-4. It will be an epic match!
I think tsitsipas was right complaining about alcaraz's grunt ...it is very loud and long...and i hope alcaraz stops grunting in the future.  Anyway the better player won today and i hope alcaraz takes the crown 👑
Tsitsipas has to be the biggest fraud not only in tennis, but in all of sports history, along with other bums like Zverev, Ozil etc etc
straight setted that man lol
Who got the big j to win the title
The nerve to hit the player on the return 😤
insane that they don’t even show set points
he beat him up so easily Tsitsipas is never gonna win a Grand Slam 1000 he's no good enough he's never been he shall not be.
Alcaraz has a natural gift for tennis. He plays like no other person, he just knows how to play. He said I know my skills and he was right. If not for his forearm, well above #1. Between him and Sinner wow, two fantastic players.
Alcaraz is my fave
i'll never understand why people boo players when they talk with the umpire that's so immensely dumb
ルード優勝
Please French media team, consider implementing the following: - Display all break-points - Display all set-points - Display full rallies - Do not spoil winner on thumbnail - Do not mind if vids are > than 3 min, that's ok. It's a 3 hour match
These tennis channels need to fix the thumbnails... they always spoil the ending by showing who the victor is
Tsitisipas seems to need more tempo control…. his rythm is too simple… I would like to see he raise the major trophy….
The drop shot king
I hope Carlos wins against Sinner but i like both of them, great to watch. Ladies & gentlemen welcome to the next 15 years we hope
How did you skip the tie break completely?
Oh Tsitsipas said sorry when he almost hit Alcaraz again!
Don’t you think this slightly looks like a fedal match? :)
Alcaraz and sinner though diff games, have started showing glimpses of the fed rafa era...  we also need a 3rd..a djoko in the mix
tsitsipas needs to hit his backhand like this: 1:45
Los mejores reves ganadores a una mano, Federer y Wawrinka. Tsisipas da ventaja con su reves
Vamos con todo Carlitos ❤🇲🇽🇪🇸
Year 2050: 52 year old tsitsipas who’s got 5 kids with badosa screams in bed at 3:45am waking badosa and the kids up. She asks him what happened and tsitsipas says nightmares of seeing Alcaraz beating him for the 100th straight match terrified him that’s why he screamed.
Sinner be win RG2024 🏆🎾
This was a heartbreaking loss for Tsitsipas. It's time to consider calling Ivanisevic. It's time. Congrats to Carlos and his smiles. :)
Sinner and Alcaraz I don't know which one to support. If there's one thing I know, it's that they're both amazing.
Can the highlights package not show the picture of the winner. I would like to watch the highlights without knowing the winner please
This edit is weird. Why mostly Stefanos winners? huh? I mean Carlos won. Show some of his too.
Ouch Tsitsipas 0-6 now against Alcaraz
I am happy that Tsitsipas is out 🤩
Im Novak fan and i like both Sinner and Alcaraz but you cant deny that Carlos became no 1 because Novak was banned and Sinner became no 1 because Novak was attacked in Rome and bad schedule in Paris.
Whole highlights but not a single shot from the second set tie break?
Those volleys from the baseline are insane. Love it!
Even though I am cheering for Sinner  I think Alcaraz may win because it is clay court but he brings the best of Sinner. Toss the coin on this one.
Next...
Go Alcaraz!!
It does happen all the time at every level - when you are losing it’s time to complain.  Novak does it a ton, Roger did it.  McEnroe always did it.  Complain hoping to disrupt the other player.  Be brave and work harder than to cry about something because you’re losing.   Sinner and Carlos will be amazing, hoping no one gets hurt…
To finish it out with the drop shot is more like saying, buddy, I own you. Don't stress... Pure class from Alcaraz. Like he said in the press, he has the key to Tsitsipas game. Tsitsipas needs to elevate his game by not just playing but making return balls harder for his opponent to bring back. He needs to put balls where it's impossible to return. He is a great player, but he needs to work harder. His returns are so weak, his game is not on Alcaraz's or Nadal, or Djokovic, Sinner, or Roger's level.  Nice game overall.
why won't Nike release the shoes that Alcaraz wears? This is like the 3rd or 4th pair of shoes that Nike won't release. Anyone know the answer?
Great win for Carlos 👍
I didn't expect this match to end so one-sidedly.😮
Alcaraz' forehand is back in the business, after some months off. It's going to be epic if they meet in RG
Sinncer vs Alcaraz is basically the Final. Whoever wins this match will lift the trophy. I doubt Ruud or Zverev can create an upset here.
Time for an entirely new coaching staff.  Its clear the current squad of Dad and friends cannot provide effective solutions
I know this series was going to be 3-0 or 3 set to 0 for Alcaraz. Based on the highlights I've seen, he's back in his absolute top form but so is Sinner❤❤❤!! With Edmonton Vs Florida Stanley Cup Finals and Sinner and Alcaraz ...PURE EXCITEMENT SPORTS!!!
thats what you get for smashing the ball at carlos all that time ago stef you big baby aaahahah
I guess Tsitsipas is too old for Alcaraz - I mean H2H  6 - 0 in favor of Alcaraz speaks to volume
Sinner and Alcaraz a different level from everyone else
Tsitsipas has the same sympathy as a mosquito  buzzing on your bed in the middle of the night.... 🤧🥶😳  Did he inherit it from his father?? 🤔 The doubt is there! 🤏🤏  For goodness sake! He's certainly a good guy and maybe even a good tennis player, but he's always argumentative and never smiles! I've never seen him smile with joy even at the Monte Carlo Masters 1000 awards. I don't think I've ever seen all his teeth in full....🤔
No need for spoiler blocker we all knew Alcaraz was going to win 😂
Come on Carlos!! you can do it!!! 💪 until the final 🙌💪
Alcaraz too good 🇪🇸🇪🇸
allan tennis clears this Alcaraz bum
Alcaraz Sinner is gonna be sick
