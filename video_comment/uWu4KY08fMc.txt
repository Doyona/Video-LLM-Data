The way Twice turns everything into a movie full of feelings with sensitive subjects is simply cinema... I love them so much
EXCUSE ME CHOU TZUYU???!!!
I didn t expect to love this as much as I do
Ohhhh J ONCE are really fortunate to see the live singing of ENEMY song😢 with choreography
Dreamy TWICE! ♡💖
I love TWICE so painfully much. They are my co-favorite group. ❤
뮤비 본편에서 다리, 영수증, 컵 같은데에도 나오던 글귀들이구나
🍭 I LOVE YOU TWICE 🍭 🐰💚💓💜🧡🐧🤍♥️💙
You have my heart.
Twice
ENEMY is out now, ONCEs! You can listen to it now and watch the MV. They always make such great music that is so good to listen to. ‘ENEMY’ is here to prove it once again.
tzuyu pretty
Twice has always worked so hard for us over the years.. I'm so very proud of them 🥹 This concept touches me to the core, I'm literally covered in goosebumps((
美しくて、でも寂しい感じがする みたいけど、見たら全部終わってしまうのでは、という気がしてしまう…
Japanese members Mina and Momo got the least parts in the Japanese title song, this is nonsense.
Twice japan make eng sub pls 🙏🏻
I am waiting
I ARRIVED LATE 😭
I ve had this on repeat all day
While Momo dressing the Joy Division shirt...Loved
TZUYU EFFORTLESSLY PERFECT AS ALWAYS
ミナアはどうしてこんなに美しいの😍💘😍
モモはなんて美しいの 😍💘😍

今日参戦したvvvvipです。ありがとうございました
京セラでみました！！！ほんまに最高だった
大阪1日目最高でした。最速で聞けたって事が1番嬉しい
子瑜馬尾造型好漂亮😍
This is the most anime I’ve seen and heard TWICE. Even when they were anime.
一足お先に大阪組は見せてもらった❤twice最高♡
今日京セラドームで観れた！ めちゃくちゃ良かったから早くもう1回観たいな
Twice ❤
かわいいですよね
They are great to be TWICE drama actresses ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Tzuyu is masterpiece😭😭
PATRONAS
Twice, el grupo más completo,  sin duda el mejor❤
ツウィ<3
The editing is top-tier. Seriously impressive
They are coming!
I love you my best gurl
何かロックソングになりそう　そんなバイブのこもった曲かも👍
ダヒョンの車のシーンに引き込まれた‥
영상미 좋다, 근데 영어 자막이 좀 작은 듯  약간 락적인 노래일 것 같다는 기대도 든다
日本のMVを毎年高クオリティで見れることに感謝！
why are the subtitles so small? I can't read them 😭
MINA CHAN NUMBA WAN
Tzu's last scene with the crescendo is so fresh that I feel like a newborn.
Sounds so Japan
Still couldn’t imagine if my life without TWICE
今日歌ってくれるかなーーー❤
子瑜太可愛
Tzuyu lovely 💖✨
i love twice
i'm really looking forward to this...
Nayeon is so pretty!!
Been in crypto long enough to know when a project is one tweet away from exploding. Bellarium Network is one of those.
I’ve been diving deep into early-stage DeFi projects and Bellarium Network is hands-down one of the most complete I’ve seen. Real tech, strong tokenomics, and a presale price that still leaves serious room to grow.
I passed on Injective Protocol early. I passed on Render early. I’m not passing on Bellarium Network BEL token. The market narratives are aligning, the product roadmap is tight, and the price point is still insanely early.
Trump’s influence on crypto markets is undeniable. Bellarium Network could ride this wave straight to the top!
The Bellarium Network presale offers unmatched value, especially with its bonuses. Don’t miss this early opportunity!
This is the most exciting presale of 2025. Bellarium Network Network is combining the best tech in AI, DeFi, and blockchain. I'm in!
when young ppl wear the Joy division Unknown pleasures T I always wonder if they ever heard the music, still Mina had a poster 4 an obscure Melvins con on her skirt 4 their debut album art/mv so ig Twice has proven theyr next level and got their creds in order 🤷‍♀
❤
Can't wait my girls 🥰❤
Awesome
Estoy ansiosa 😅❤
子瑜～ 好漂亮🥰
When I hear this, I feel the warmth it gives it so calm. Twice never dis appoint us they keep soaring high but still they were down to earth., so kind and lovable. I will keep support them till the end no matter what it takes.
THIS SONG GONNA BE DARK AND EMOTIONAL ❤❤😢😢
I cannot wait for enemy it is going to be the most beautiful song to exist
かわいい
不自覺的一直想反覆看
It's very nice ❤🫡
静謐さが、言葉を染み込ませてくれる。
จื่อสวยมากจัง🥹💙
Amazing TWICE
ツウィちゃん、昔の倉木麻衣ちゃんみたいなポニーテールでとてもエモい❤かわいすぎる

もうMV見なくても神曲ってわかる🥺
LINDAAAAS
Eu nunca vi tantos comentários falando da tzuyu mds
Will the MV be released tonight at midnight (Japan time) then? Teaser last night, then Osaka leg of the tour tomorrow, and Japanese MVs usually released a month before the album... what do you think?
I want this to be the raw emotional song so much, omg.
Jeongyeon, why are you drawing grafitti on the bridge? 😳🤣
💜💜💜
これだけで何故か泣きそうになる
Wow
쯔위 너무 예쁘고 영상 커버도 예쁘게 잘 만드시는 분이에요
子瑜太美了😍😍
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Twice giving us so much depth with such vivid imagery in this teaser....this album might actually hit in depths we ONCEs need to listen every closely too
❤❤❤❤
I’m so excited for this album 🤗
🥰🥰🥰Wuli Tzu😘😘😘😘😘😘
Love twice ❤❤
Tzuyu❤❤❤
Tzuyu has the kind of presence that belongs on screen. At first, you’d think her sharp features and intense gaze would make her perfect for playing a villain, and honestly, she would nail that. But the more you watch her, the clearer it becomes that she’s capable of much more. She can shift from looking strong and intimidating to soft and innocent in an instant, and that kind of range is rare. What really makes her stand out is how much she can say with just her eyes. It’s the same quality you see in actresses like Anya Taylor-Joy or Eva Green, the ability to communicate emotion without a single line of dialogue. It’s subtle but it pulls you in. With that kind of natural screen presence, Tzuyu could handle just about any role, from thrillers to emotional dramas. She doesn’t just look like she fits in front of a camera, she feels like she’s meant to be there.
Oye esas letras enanas nada que ver loll
O maior e melhor gg de todos
子瑜醬子美貌讓人目不轉睛，一直重複輪播 DIVE IN TZU 是怎麼一回事？整個超像日劇女主角出場場面～配樂聽起來好熱血，期待值爆表！！
昨日Xで「Like 1はONE OK ROCKのTakaとToruが作曲した」ってポストを見たからなのか、最後にちょっとだけ流れる曲が既にONE OK ROCKっぽく感じるんだが
Queen Twice
Tzuyu in the thumbnail! I thought it's a 10 years old video
Twice is always busy..
The english sub smaller than my boobs 😢
Asia's one top girlgroup
Tzuyu Tzuyu Tzuyu
Momo vs Jeongyeon - Jihyo vs Tzuyu - Mina vs Chaeyoung - Dahyun vs Night ? - Nayeon vs Day?

Love support tzuyu ❤️❤️
Looking forward for this!!✨💗 Twice is always amazing as ever!! Love you Tzuyu!! ❤❤❤

Visual effects: Tzuyu remains as beautiful as ever for ten years💙
仕事休憩中〜 帰宅してから落ち着いて見ます。
❤️❤️❤️❤️🍑❤️❤️❤️❤️👍🏽
TWICE DRAMA
😂😂😂
Tzuyu visual is insane ❤
何でこれを観ただけで泣いているんだ私は…自分でも分からない...
I CANT WAIT
i can’t wait to see this mv
TWICE <3
Good job jihyo
QUEEN
If they drop melodic, Cherry Filter-style rock with real instruments and a catchy chorus, I’m gonna have this on repeat for weeks. No fake streams - just real listens because it’s that good. This trailer already looks and sounds way better than TIF ever did. Can’t wait to see it.
lets support the girls on this new comeback 🫡
twice once again proving they are the best group ever ❤❤
Can't wait. Can't wait. . .
Oh, pop rock influence? 👀👀
Tzuyu so lovely   > . <
Tzuyu
Tzuyu 😢❤
Tzuyu is breath taking beautiful❤
Momo in a Joy Division shirt is pretty rad.
神曲確定!
outfits so good
Wow Tzuyu😍
Sana, Jihyo & Tzuyu shared similar theme (studio apartment). Also Nayeon, Mina & Chae (bus stop). Also Jeongyeon & Momo (bridge). Dahyun had car scene, consistent with the opening trailer. Interesting.
Oh look chewy getting her due 💖
Teaserだけでいいっていうのが伝わる。はやくみたいなー！！
Ahhh!!, this mv is going to be the most beautiful and emotional one I've seen from TWICE, everyone looks so pretty here   🥹🤧💓💞💞
子瑜出道十年了  仍保有如此純真清澈的眼神  真的很難得~~
Wow! TWICE ladies are truly multi-talented!! Special shout out to Jihyo for her special role in the creation of this MV Teaser! 👏👏👏
J-Once are so lucky - Twice don't skimp on their Japanese efforts so they get a lot of cool stuff specifically for them plus all the original Korean stuff too. Not to mention they have their own awesome subunit in Misamo. Thanks to Japanese Once for all the love and support they give Twice in return!
すごくすごく雰囲気が良くて、MVも楽しみだけど手元に届くアルバムがめちゃくちゃ楽しみです🌅
30日デジタル配信とMV！！！ 大阪で初披露するかな？🫣
Republic records is  NOWHERE TO BE FOUND again
ツウィちゃん。ジブリに出そうなポニーテールしてるし、ジブリから出てきちゃったみたいな感じで最高✨
Tzuyuuu can
JYPE always gets us with the Tzuyu thumbnail 😣
우와노래내취향일듯❤
No puedo esperar para presenciar el lanzamiento de este increíble álbum
The subtitle so small😂
なんか普通に映画とか予告でも使えそう
aoty incomingggg
Did jyp let twice rest ????
TZUYU🥰
Tzuyu thumbnail sent me here 😍
All the visuals and vibe scream rock, and that drum hit at 0:52 makes me expect distorted guitars to kick in, building toward a massive, catchy chorus. All signs point to this being a rock concept  so I'd be disappointed if there aren't any distorted guitars in it.But after TIF let me down I've learned that a beautiful concept doesn't always guarantee great music. Those photos looked incredible, but had nothing to do with the songs or the video.This time, I just want the sound to match the mood and visuals. For the love of God, don't let this be another throwaway 2-minute Tiktok mess. Let the music actually deliver what this concept promises.
Woww chou tzuyuuuuu
Tzuyu is very beautiful, especially her eyes 💖✨
Tzuyu ah you're so pretty
Yes tzuyu thumbnail
Tzuyu ahhh
Twice the best kpop group
🩷🩷🩷
I lov you mina 🍒
ROCK!!!!!!!!!!??????????????
Parece que voy a llorar con este Comeback 💔💔

I love twice so much
Super excited !
進化が止まらないグループってあるんだなぁ。年々　綺麗に洗練されている。それぞれが素晴らしく相乗効果が♾️無限大

TZUYU so pretty
TZUYU TZUYU IS LOVELY
I can’t waitt
If you’re looking for your first crypto investment, Bellarium Network presale looks like a excellent starting point.
Bellarium Network BEL cross chain AI combo is what sets it apart for me. Time to join the presale ASAP.
The key move is to get in early, with Bellarium Network BEL token you can do that
❤❤❤
Bellarium presale might be the only presale I’ve joined this year. It just checks all the right boxes.
Bellarium Network BEL is gearing up to be the next big thing in DeFi! I'm already in the presale—are you? The early bird gets the best gains!
Ladies and gentlemen, Bellarium Network BEL is definitely a superb project, great investment opportunity!!
Lo preciosas que se ven porfavor  TWICE MY WORLD
I'm buying the Bellarium Network BEL token, I believe it will yield at least 100x this cycle.
If you’re not paying attention to Bellarium Network during this alt run, you’re missing out on one of the most exciting ICOs!
Bellarium Network BEL is a top gem, DYOR!!!!!
For me, Bellarium Network presale is the perfect mix of early, legit, and slept on. I’m in before the crowd wakes up.
I´m bullish on Bellarium Network and their BEL token, presale at its finest, don´t miss
Presale is over halfway sold and they’re barely doing big marketing yet. That tells me serious investors are already loading up in Bellarium Network.
Congrats to all early adopters, Bellarium Network BEL token will crush this year
When Trump pumps the market, altcoins explode—and Bellarium Network token has everything needed to lead the pack
If you’re looking for your first crypto investment, Bellarium Network presale looks like a excellent starting point.
Twice can do one comeback per year and just enjoyyy the rest of the yearrr
뮤비가 꼭 한장면의 영화 보는것 같아 정말 너무 좋고 트와이스 멤버들 정말 다들 너무 예쁘다😭❤️❤️
TWICE
I really wanna know what kind of songs is this
It feels like ref:rain by aimer!! I love that song, so i am super excited for this one!!
LOVE YOU TWICE  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is so beautiful ♥
OMG TZUYU 😱😱😱
TWICE「ENEMY」MV TEASER  / PAIN
Why does this looks and sounds like it’s gonna be their most emotionally charged single to be released yet???
わんだふる
Japan MV for me seems to be winning in aesthetic since MISAMO.

Por qué siento que estoy viendo renacer a Twice? Es muy emocionante, siento que no va a ser el típico title track, probablemente supere a Dive!! Estoy emocionada!!!!
Chae eating an apple again in this second teaser lol
God I hope that's the actual song intro! Twice is just off the chain!
大好きだよ〜🥰💓💕💕💖💖💝💘💘
Dahyun so beautiful

This is for album just dropped and now they are dropping new teasers !?? Do Jyp artists even have time to breath ?
子瑜好清純好美❤⋯⋯
The 2 Trailer's/Teasers got me so curious for the Album/MV. They all look beautiful!

Oh my God! The TZUYU thumbnail is undeniably beautiful!
Not many chances left to get BEL under $1. Tick tock. Bellarium Network presale is moving fast..
Not many chances left to get BEL under $1. Tick tock. Bellarium Network presale is moving fast..
There’s something powerful about a project that isn’t relying on hype to grow. Bellarium Network is focusing on building and onboarding quietly. That’s usually the one that runs hardest once eyes finally turn to it.
Honestly? I only ape into like 1 out of 20 presales. Bellarium Network BEL was an easy yes.
It's not just about moonshots — Bellarium Network BEL feels like an asset that can last across market cycles.
Bull runs reward early positioning. Projects like Bellarium Network will surprise everyone.
High-quality projects in low-cap phase are rare. Bellarium Network is one of them.
A friend tipped me off about Bellarium Network — deep dive confirmed it’s not just hype.
I'm getting in before institutions even thinks about this one. The market loves narrative tokens, and Bellarium Network BEL has every narrative baked in: AI, DeFi, early, and viral-ready.
Bellarium Network BEL presale is quietly becoming one of the best-positioned projects in this market.
People will wish they knew about Bellarium BEL token before the listings. Early advantage matters.
Imagine ignoring Bellarium Network presale just because it’s early. Couldn’t be me.
Institutional eyes will be on projects like Bellarium Network when utility tokens come back into favor.
Crypto is full of regrets. I don’t want to add “I saw Bellarium Network presale and did nothing” to the list. Timing is everything in this space, and this one’s looking like a perfect entry.
Just charted Bellarium Network BEL token growth projections post-presale… if they deliver, we’re looking at 50–100x.
I hesitated on a similar presale last year… not making that mistake with Bellarium Network. BEL locked.
Just ran some comparisons with other AI tokens, Bellarium Network´s BEL token is criminally undervalued right now.
Bellarium Network has that perfect early-stage setup — low entry, strong fundamentals, and trending narratives.
Most presales I ignore because they’re just hype. But Bellarium Network actually has a full ecosystem planned out — not just a whitepaper with dreams. This one could seriously go far.
Crypto is full of regrets. I don’t want to add “I saw Bellarium Network presale and did nothing” to the list. Timing is everything in this space, and this one’s looking like a perfect entry.
The tech behind Bellarium Network BEL is more advanced than most of the top 100. It’s early still.
YO SE QUE VA A SER UN TEMON LOCOOOOOOOO😭‼️
Queens
This song is going to be the most beautiful song in our galaxy ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love this ❤❤❤
Esse mv com certeza vai ser um dos mais bonitos que o twice já fez ❤

Their Japanese releases always have such a different mood/feel from their others and I love that so much! 😊
Loveeeee you twice. they did a 1 minute grounding . i wish subtitles were clearer

🤗💚
Tzuyu Beautiful😊😊❤
That last part with the drums 😧 ?!! Im hoping they’re going for more of a rock style type of beat, but I wonder how are they going to do it? Anyways I just know it’s gonna be good 😌
I wish Tzuyu could play drama
Solo toca esperar el estreno de la canción, estoy muy emocionada todas se ven muy bonitas y me gusta mucho el concepto🎉❤
Tzuyu ❤

Is this going to be like rewind? I’m dying for another ballad that has the same vibes, something I can cry to 😫😭
Doble premio 🔥 Twice cb japonés y Skz cb coreano ❤
oh this is about to be so good
很奇怪，JYP在日本那麼推MISAMO，為什麼封面又要放子瑜!然後給子瑜的資源又少的可憐!
0:45 からの音良すぎん？✨
日本カムバック期待大すぎる👏✨
Tzuyu you are so gorgeous!!!

حبيييييييت❤❤❤❤
LOVE Tzuyu💙❣️

Damn that had an anime opening feel
MiChaeng sitting at the same bus-stop
So excited ❤️
AI QUE BABADOOOOOOO
😘Tzuyu 💙👸
Momo and Mina, my god.....
Twice are the best❤
Que coisa mais linda esse vídeo, ele me trás uma vibe meio estranha, me trás o mesmo sentimento que já tive quando eu era criança, esses tipo de vídeo assim sozinho em um lugar mágico como esses me dá uma vibe meio triste, más por favor não pare de fazer esse tipo de video, porque apesar de tudo eu amo esse tipo de conteúdo me resgata lembranças boas da infância, aconteceu a mesma coisa comigo com a música "DOREMI" do Purple Kiss, Te Amo para sempre TWICE, obrigado por essa obra de arte, estou ansioso por isso, ONCE até o fim ❤🇧🇷
Why do I got emotional on the last 10 seconds of the teaser.
我家子瑜太美了~
Tzuyu se ve demasiado irreal, tiene aura de actriz
This is something that sounds like summer.☀️
They are look like character of Ghibli ⛩️🚞🛥️🌉🗻🎡🎠
每天都要看子瑜，9個都是寶貝
sounds soooo good I'm craving for the album😭😭😭😭
las amooooooo
Twice ❤
The music ugh it’s gonna be my favorite for sure 😩💖💖💖
Pain 💔💔💔💔💔

I LOVE TZUYU
Damn these girls don't rest 🤧
Noah could've easily walked down that

Tzuyu has the best natural beauty! but Ive also always liked Jeongnyeon, especially when she had short hair.
Que emoción!!! 6 días más!!! TE AMO TWICE!!!

Best gg comeback
Im looking forward to the release of this album and the mv. Jihyo participating in the direction in this album made me so excited!
Wow, I'm loving the build up for this album
10 years into the game and they’re still doing it like during their debut days. You can truly tell they love being idols and I’m here to support that 💯
Can't wait
My main girl group Twice the G.O.A.T
They definitely should have made the text even smaller. I can still read it
✨⚡✨ 💗🤩Right there!! 💞🥰💞
子瑜封面我啪一下就點進去😊
I'm patiently waiting and excited for the epic story of Enemy that's about to unfold🔥🔥🔥 Twice is in a totally new era of life and women and artists and I can't wait to see their stories be told in  such an iconic and rock on way💚💚💚
Ouuu loving the instrumentals near the end ❤

マジで楽しみ！！
I can't wait any longer, they look so cool.
It looks like movie teaser
OMG amoooo que emoción
MiChaeng in the same bus booth. SATZU in the same bedroom❤❤❤.
子瑜！！！😭
Wow what a long teaser
HOLY. IT’s going to be a rock album. 😮😳❤️
the sound of the guitar...oh, my god, what a nice tune. from just one sound I feel the vibration of a summer Japanese hit! p.s. I need to remember the direction, maybe I'll find something on the way
I don’t know why but after watching teaser only i got goosebumps,,, can’t wait for mv ………….
直筆のメッセージに、意味深で何かを悟った表情。  今までのtwiceとはなにか違う雰囲気で楽しみです。
Tzuyu.     ❤❤❤❤❤
Suka banget vibesnya!! Dan instrumental di akhir itu band Jepang banget!!!
I like everything, it looks brutal in good sense
これまでにないコンセプトだからめっちゃ楽しみ！
i just know this is gonna be wonderful 💓
idk why i got choked up watching dahyun's shot. then started tearing up with jeongyeon's shot, then everything was good again for tzuyu. XD
Un concepto nuevo de twice, me encantaría <3
twicee
Love Twice so cute ❤❤
馬尾子瑜好清純😻💞
Views froze again
Hermosaaaa
Eu estava olhando a postagem do Twice, vai ter a participação do Taka no álbum??😮
This is titled pain, but already feels like it’s going to heal. The  visuals, concept, and rock sound at the end, I can’t get enough!
0:47 Oh my Tzuyu
🥺💖💖💖💖
Momoring and the whole twice❤❤❤❤ I think it will include a rock type song
Wow Tzuyu😮
Director Jihyo, I feel the pain 🥺
OMG
ツウィは高めのポニーテールでとっても可愛い❤

1M !!!
ue gnt o mv nao ia ser lançado em agosto?
still can't get over with This is for yet we have another????
THOSE TINY TINYYYY SUBTITLES I CANNOT READ OMG
They so beautiful
Siento que este mv es algo muy personal de ellas, como si nos dijeran que ya están cansadas, pero que seguirán para hacernos reír, aunque a veces les duele tener que sostener todo, giras, conciertos, mantenerse lindas y así. Yo me fije mas en la letra, aunque como no se mucho ingles, solo intérprete unas cuantas, no tomen esto como la realidad, es solo mi perspectiva
My God, the feelings in this trailer!
TE AMO
Metas enemy 2 mi de views 300 mil likes
MY GURLSSSSSSSSS
Cuando ví la parte de Jihyo quebré en llanto.
Perfect
0:54 おとめかん❤
Twice
yo admiro demasiado el trabajo de jihyo desde su solo, sin duda merece muchísimo más y su álbum (opinión personal y un poco controversial) es uno de los mejores albums de una solista de kpop, hasta me atrevo a decir que mucho mejor que los albums de nayeon :(
❤我的子瑜真的很漂亮💙🫠🫠😘😍🥰
Twice vai lançar um rockzão... mal posso esperar por isso!!!!
la escena de las manzanas es tan real es como cuando quieres encajar pero simplemente no hay campo para ti o talvez solo no perteneces allí, realmente esto es hermoso amo este lado de twice
This sounds so good, its like a song the plays at the end of feel good movie or anime...
Japanese discography of Twice is always perfect ❤🎉
OKAY DIRECTOR JIHYO
Dios mío, amo los comebacks japoneses, están mega planeados y reflejan una realidad no tan linda.

I LOVE TWICE❤ the diversity of their concepts  Is insane

Didn’t expect the song/MV to be released so soon, but I’m happy! From the concept pics and teasers, I’m expecting a rock-influenced track 🙏🏻  Also, please kindly make the subtitles bigger! Thanks! 🙏🏻
AMOOOO OMGGG
TWICE Japan comebacks never miss. Always serving, always hyped, and the praise? So well deserved.
일본 정규는 다른 분위기구만 무슨 노래일지 궁금하네

IT'S LIKE FINDING PEACE IN THE SMALLEST AND RANDOM THINGS THAT'S EVERYWHERE (I GUESS?) ANYWAYS, I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE ALBUM TO BE RELEASED 🫶🫶🫶🫶
Twice members always makes us smiles
The whole message because it may be too small for some people:  "Put your hand by your ear, and quietly listen to distant sounds. Face towards a place where the sun shines, turn your body right and look up. Quietly repeat in your mind the last words you heard. In a room where the lights have gone out, move closer the single remaining light. Turn your face toward the wind as it blows. Take two steps back, and look to your left. Take a bite of the fruit mentioned on the ninth line. Look down, then peer through the gap between the stones. Slowly open the desk drawer and check whats right at the back."
Beautiful visuals
Oh my gosh, I have to wait for a month!
今回は、早く新曲を聞きたい！よりも、 早くMVを観たい  の方が大きいかも……10年という節目に、彼女達は何を見せてくれるんだろう
It’s really gonna be a rock album 🎸
Twice=perfect
ONCE most spoiled fandom. 🥰
давайте добейте меня
While the longer teaser is dark and broody, showing them at their darkest moment, this teaser is slow and so relaxing, maybe showing that once you've faced your ENEMY, you can slowly start to heal?  長めのティーザーは暗く陰鬱で、彼らの最も暗い瞬間を描いていますが、このティーザーはゆっくりとした雰囲気で、リラックスした雰囲気です。ENEMYと対峙した後、ゆっくりと癒されていく様子を描いているのかもしれません。
GOD JIHYO
QUALITY
Mmm
Siento q voy a amr está canción  Hasta ahora todo lo han mostrado me encanta y me lleve a la nostalgia y el deber de lo q hay q hacer y de como me siento
Tzuyu <3
It's genius
Legends will be told about TWICE 10,000 years from now.

おーー！！！楽しみ！！！🎉🎉😊😊😊😊
LINDAS MARAVILHOSAS PERFEITAS INCRÍVEIS ENTREGANDO VÁRIOS COMEBACKS , MAS PRECISAVA D ME REPRESENTAR EM TODAS?
me encantóooo
Sana, one of the visuals and yet constantly given bad shots in their recent comebacks, from the Korean concept photos and album and now from this Japanese trailer. Not giving her a close up shot is a crime. From getting fewer and fewer lines in the songs, getting sideline each comeback, like who the heck did she pissed from the powers that be.
so beautiful 💗😭
このMVはポップロックジャンルですか？
TWICE members being part of the album-making never fails to make me in awe (Jihyo and Dahyun wrote songs for the album 'ENEMY' and Jihyo narrated and directed the 'ENEMY' trailer video). They're indeed so talented. When it comes to making music, they always slay.
omgg
They are perfect 🤚🏻
Ah
美しすぎる！！！！完璧
Thank you Twice for everything ❤
Omg this looks awesome
WATT
今までに無いワクワク感！！
For a second I thought why are there 2 Tzuyu scenes? I thought Sana was also Tzuyu :D
Nice and another diff concept, can't wait! So proud of TDOONGS! Love you 9WICE! 🥰
❤
周子瑜完美😍😍😍
TWICE IS READY TO SLAY AGAIN
めっっっっちゃドキドキする😭💗💗💗
本国カムバより力入ってる気がする笑 オシャレ系？最後がロック感あるし楽しみすぎるしすでに最高！！ TWICEちゃんどこまで楽しませてくれるんだ
cant wait any longer😍

I commend how cinematic the MV trailers for this album lately. It's so beautiful, giving another level of depth to TWICE's artistry. I love Jihyo's vision on this one. I'm excited for the MV!
