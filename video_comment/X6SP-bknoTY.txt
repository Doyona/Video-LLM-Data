Please can someone tell me what CAF base on when coming up with groups.nigeria,morocco ,Tunisia and Kenya are you serious ,this is how you can define hate in another words.Ourr founding father Kenyatta. Once said we kenyans we are like sleeping people soon we will wake and demand our freedom in sports.And we are awake with u 20 team.
Nigeria came prared to win
kenya dorminated this for sure
These flying Eagles are going no where; everyone knows how dangerous the Nigerian cadets use to be, these ones are poorly trained.
هادت كينيا هناك تطور جميل .برافوا .لكن استغربت من نيجيريا فريق ضعيف للغاية ..
Kenya is better than the useless Nigeria team. I love Kenya #10. He got good future.
East African teams are rapidly coming up --- Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda are all doing extremely in grassroots football. All these teams have a bright future.
Please appreciate your country's effort , that's what normal citizens do.
Politics will end Nigeria football
nigeria is a cursed land even their puppet tinunubbu is also cursed.
Go team Kenya, though we're last in the table, more practice and we'll soar
This team no good at all. How did they bring this guys together. Are you telling me this is the best under 20 boys we have in Nigeria? Smh
Kenyan team is very good with real U20 players. The future is luminous.

President Tinubu Nigeria Players are Hungry 😅😂😂
The Nigeria players are very bad!
Nigeria player's looks "HUNGRY" No strength at all
All these players are jus a  Joke to me seriously, what is this, how did they pick this as the best u20 in Nigeria, 😅😂😢😊, they can't cross, square play, no team work or anything
Nigeria team is useless
Nigeria has no team and no technical deft.
