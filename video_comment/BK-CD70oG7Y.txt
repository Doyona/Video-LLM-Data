yo thx for me finding who i truly am, without u i would be hella depressed fr
Just so y'know   Azula taking over Ba Sing Se is NOT on her to-do list  She just happened to be in the area  ....ho was crazy before she went insane
11:41 😑 I saw that
This is definitely one of the more hilarious ones. seriously. 9/10 LMAOoooooFF
Mortal Kombat!!!
Taylee will get the "chuga chuga CO CO
Kafsha😂😂😂😂
The Link screams get me every fkn time! 🤣🤣
Man i know she crazy but i feel bad for her
nice
Azula cannot be treated,she's a shell of her former self
ATLA X CJ is TOOOO GOATED
It's 2025, and I'm surprised CJ hasn't looked at Kane ('03)
This is one your best videos till date 😂
Bruh ATLA is so deep 😮
Azula aint that bad of a person  I can fix her
Guys, don't let the beach episode fool you, you can't fix her
im just now watching this and ngl a video on Junko Enoshima from Danganronpa would be peak cuz bro over the course of 4 games and an anime, that girl is tweaked the fuck out. if theres any other girl who can join the roundtable or the asylum, its Junko. Please do a video on her soon CJ lol
17:44 DESTROYS ME
7:03 how you the leader and be not in the middle that's crazy
14 year old girl btw
Pt2 please 🙏🏾 😢 😭  CJ
Rated M? Lol
Azula, a 14 year old girl, has got more elite hands than most of the other cast. Hell, she's got more elite hands than some of the absolute BUMS in other shows/anime. Matter of fact, I feel like pre-betrayal Azula has got better technique than Ozai in combat and in firebending. She is also the first of the only two people in the entirety of the Avatar universe to ever have blue flames, and can spam lightning attacks, WITHOUT being under the influence of Sozen's comet.
16:43"If a woman said this to me, I would say, you are also a psychopath like me, bro? Dab me up
She actually kills Aang it's not like a knocked out sort of thing he legit died, and we were watching as the cycle of the avatar was about to break. If it wasn't for Katara we wouldn't have gotten Korra, which I would have been okay with tbh. But my boi couldn't die like that.
Okay so I didn't really watch Avatar as much as a kid, but I knew a little bit about it. But this man Zuko was getting his ass whooped so much I always thought HE was the younger sibling😂😂
Yo CJ you should look into Cinder from RWBY. She could be at the round table or the asylum
3:14 lol it actually was a part of it. Losers of Agni Kais must mark themselves as the loser by shaving off all their hair but the ponytail.
This had me dead cus of the sound effect and how many time bro got decked in the face 7:55
5:45
Yo lets not put Lloyd in the Asylum not the round table once you watch 7th prince Cj that femboy is bad news 😂
17:12 The damn polar Express is crazy but very accurate on multiple levels cuz of winter and all the white stuff they trying snow on her azz lol 😭😭😭😭😭😂😅
11:42 I have too many questions to ask you, but I don’t have any answers, so yeah
That final scream of insanity her voice actress delivered required that she (actress) had to dive deep into her trauma. Trauma so dark she refuses to talk about it, and still refuses to hear her own EXQUISITE performance to not relive it. That urge to feel bad for Azula is just you feeling bad for the lady behind the mic. I give all thanks i can possibly give for that sacrifice.
Azula was so hot 😍😍😋💦
This new series is low-key giving Outlast vibes, if you know, you know
14:23 In all honesty, you can give Azula the title of Protagonist Killer
Wait have we put Azula at the Black Airforce activity table yet?
17:22
Azula conquered the Earth Kingdom capitol and killed the Avatar (and would have ended the Avatar cycle if not for Spirit Water plot armor).   She literally peaked at the age of FOURTEEN, and it only went downhill from there.
Let it be known that Azula hasn't seen her big brother in three years, and her first move in a fight is "yeah, kill that weak little shit."
Azula and Toph were the best additions to ATLA season 2. I used to watch "The Blind Bandit" multiple times just to watch Toph tear those wrestlers apart, and any episode with Azula is a good time.   I imagine an adult Azula would marry Mai or Ty Lee by force, because there is no man ALIVE who can handle her. (Except maybe Sokka because his charisma with girls is impossible.)
Let's be honest if aang has to fight azula and ozai during the comet he would be dead
We need midari frm kakeguri  the crazy btch who stabs her eye ball out and maybe throw in tomoko from wotomote shes a bit fkn weird 😂
22:12 MORTAL KOMBAT!!!
What's funny is... a bunch of the characters in this series will ACTUALLY have seen the inside of an asylum. As the one kept away from society.
6:48
@Cj_DaChamp Yumeko Jabami from Kakegurui belongs in this Asylum
Azula is a prime example of “If crazy why hot?”
Quero dizer, Azula é má. Se fosse eu, derrotaria Ozai e obrigá-lo-ia a assistir enquanto transformava Azula numa mulher. Faria aquele homem mau assistir enquanto fodia a sua filha por trás, reorganizava as entranhas de Az e a enchia com o meu creme. Faria dela uma mamã, tal como a Katara e a Toph transformam todas elas em mamãs. Não me importo se elas se tornam mães, quer queiram quer não.😛
Azula is one of the villains, who is smart enough to stop a hero from transforming
21:37 Azula... return the Slab
Ma ego say , I can fix her 😭
16:39 I am incredibly embarrassed to admit this shi would work on me……
8:23 Did he just call an axolotl a damn SALAMANDER?! 😂😂😂
17:56   DOOKIEDOOKIEDOOKIEDOOKIEDOOKIEDOOKIE!!!!!
Azula is bad asf. Shi man I wouldn't even wanna fix her she fine ash this way🙏🏻
She was ALWAYS crazy, all that happened in the finale was she showed it more clearly.
6:10😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 entertain me b
0:50😂😂😂😂
The ponytail was indeed part of his banishment
New reaction
I can fix her
11:08 MUD.....JUST SAY MUD
You should do more insane characters!!!!
16:50 SAME REACTION. I may be autistic but _thats not how you fuckin infodump_  *THE LOCK-UP WAS INEVITABLE*  Edit 17:52 *_ALSO THIS._*
The main difference is Zuko has a conscience and doesn’t want to hurt or kill people, which is why he never seems to go for the kill against the gaang or go all out, and why when he does get upper hand he doesn’t keep attacking, like when Sokka kept attacking him and he effortlessly beat him each time, if he was like Azula Sokka wouldn’t get a second chance.
INSANELY BUT FAVORITE MOMENTS 1:55 2:12 2:36 2:54 3:03 3:13 3:22 3:59 4:56 5:13 5:29 5:56 6:18 6:39 6:50 6:55 7:00 7:11 7:28 7:45 7:56 8:12 8:19 8:28 8:48 8:52 9:03 9:33 10:04 11:00 11:19 11:38 11:44 11:54 12:04 13:02 13:30 13:40 14:00 14:22 14:27 14:51 15:02 15:10 15:19 16:21 16:33 16:41 16:59 17:07 17:12 17:40 17:55 18:03 18:54 19:18 19:44 20:25 20:32 20:51 21:13 21:18 21:31 22:08 22:44 22:54 23:03
7:47 cracks me up 😂😂😂😭😭😭
The fact that Zuko and CJ put Azula in an asylum probably shows how insane she is. 😵‍💫
Remember that Azula is 14 through all this.
3:14 i absolutely lost it man 😂😂😂😂
"She's crazy and she needs to go down"
Bro honestly, not even god can pull me out of azula.☠️
Dio needs to be in the asylum jsjs
Without a DOUBT The Joker is AUTOMATICALLY in solitary confinement, no video needed... <but please do :>
15:50 Memphis Bleek, dammmnnn that was a deep cut even by your standards.
10 year old me: I can fix her
Oh hold up, you should do that crazy purple haired bitch from Tokyo Ghoul. Idk his name please tell me.
U need do a video about kira from jojo
11:21 Azula looks fine in the Earth Kingdom regalia fr
3:15 "Was a part of the banishment?" Ofc it's a banishment from the huzz
"ENTERTAIN ME BITCH" had dead lmfaoooo 💀
14:24 PAUSEEEEEE💀💀💀
1st day on the job  and we get a mentaly unstable princess thats the textbook definition of a wild fire
Cj, pick this one up again and try prince Lloyd from reincarnated to perfect my magical ability! It's actually pretty good but the MC needs to be evaluated, like fr fr 😂❤
Actually azula infultrating and taking over ba sing se is actually more impressive since hundreds of generals including IROH couldn't take over ba sing se and azula despite being *14 YEARS OLD!!!!!* TOOK OVER AND DID WHAT HUNDREDS OF GENERALS COULDN'T
As long as it isn't like Arkham, I think this asylum should be good to hold these characters...
You need to watch RWBY. It has a character (Cinder Fall) who is very similar to Azula. She gets more powerful and scary each volume, and has more plot armor than any of the four protagonists. She is also capable of killing named characters not just background npcs (though she kills them as well). She is the ultimate villain girlboss (aside from her immortal eldritch boss but she is on another playing field altogether).
whoever be writing this mans script needs a promotion fr🤣
17:51 she turned his face into a cartoon 🤣🤣🤣
Did I just hear uncle ruckus??😂😂😂😂
to be honest i think azula will ended up get killed if brightburn fights her
7:10  What did Tom-Tom do😭
3:20 The minute I saw Azula smile evilly while half of Zuko's FACE ON FIRE, I KNEW she was a menace.   Notice how nearly all of the others in the crowd don't smile at this! Zhao smiled too, but he just looked smug.   Azula here looked ecstatic and joyful! I dare say she may have gotten a certain.... satisfaction from witnessing this! 🤢
21:16  "Azulaaaaaaa didn't i teach you to say no to drugs" 😆😆 is FRYING me!!
Suggestions for the future Freaky fred: Courage the cowardly dog Kira: jjba
NAH FR CAUSE SHE WAS ON TEAM AVATAR NECKKK 28/10 I STGGGG
22:41 😭
Shoutout to the Brave Fencer Musashi OST 4:03-4:33
That split was nasty
17:43
Yo Cj, you forgot the most craziest and most person to ever crash out  Gon Freecss
13:04 there is no war in ba sing se.
I got more respect for Zuko then Azula, she clearly didn't care about her mother at all since she continues to kiss her daddy's ass
22:53 he?
16:39  this shit had me dying bro
16:40 That would have worked on me
I never liked the Avatar series.  You just made it watchable for me, ty.
Love this series bro
cool
Honestly, I would wholeheartedly watch the anime by CJ DaChamp if it was like this video
You can really tell that Grey DeLisie had a fun time voicing Azula.
Azula is the only person to really touch Aang in the whole series
17:45 THE FUCKING JECT THEME GOES HARD 🔥🔥🔥🔥   "Otherworld" is the name of the song yalls
Tim Tom has the fire emoji on his head🔥🔥🔥🤣🤣
We should get a Yuno Gasai vid cause that girl is stupidly crazy
At 15:51 was slick putting nba street ball vol 2 sound track in.😂😂😂😂
who's next for the asylum?
Bro are you doing a hisoka case?!?!?
My. Bros rizz is not good
Azula’s journey throughout the entire series can be defined as nothing else, but just demonic. From just tracking down Zuko and Iroh to taking over Ba Sing Se and temporarily killing Aang, and then going completely downhill sanity wise in the span of like 10 episodes or couple months.   Makes me wonder if we could get a video on the White Lotus and how much on demon time they were on as well.
Bruh, if you think Azula is bad?? Palpatine killed his parents when he was a teen and choice plagueis big headed ass
When this series will return?
I can fix her
i just realized the clown from the simpsons is homer just with clown shit own and white
I cannot tally the crimes cause there is no way but her score is 5 out of 10 on the meter  Will she recover: 50/50 shot
You should make a video about Joker
15:18
Lol Didn't I teach you to say no! 21:37
17:44 lol
lol 16:21
13:23 I know that sound...
When you gon do episode 2 of this cj? I neeeed it
18:35 “Uhh, saving my mans. A feeling that you will never know.” is the perfect translation for “I love Zuko more than I fear you.” Got to hand it Zuko. That man was super lucky and super blessed to have a girl like Mai at his corner. Mai’s uncle ran the Prison, Mai was willing to help him escape, and Mai was willing to give up damn near everything to help Zuko. Mai was perfect for Zuko, a dedicated girl who saw her for who he is, was more than willing to stand up to Azula, and was also good with Blades; something Zuko himself was also good at.
U need to do kora
She the best sister frfr - made Zuko find his true calling
3:15 It actually is
22:40 is perfect limp sink 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
16:51 - Her game was so horrible that it brought out a "live" shot of CJ. How often do you see THAT here? Even Lil' Miss Miss-Every-Shot-In-The-Clip didn't cause that.
Azula is insane like actually
Don't you dare compare azula with the greatestanime character ever. Blasphemy!!!
Why isn’t Uncle Ruckus in the asylum?
Do orochimaru
yes that rizz would’ve got me well maybe i’m insane to lol 😂
The JOKER better get nominated in this asylum
MY WIFE AZULA 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵!
been fat my whole life no queezy
16:15 😂😂😂
I can fix her
21:44 Azula is So Cracked that John Cena’s facial expression Synced CJ’s Reaction 😳
Uhm cj jay wtf is going on
I need one of these for princess bubblegum
20:28 Sir Topham Hatt Shadow Realm meme!!
You forgot how she survived those five kids attacking her with the four element bending styles and a boomerang.
so look why eveybody playing that cherry pit scene held more information than what was led on azula saved her own life if she would have swollowed that pit, choking would have been the last of her issues fr fr
😎👍
17:55 absolute banger
FUN FACT: Azula's team is actually called Ozai's Angels
Iroh jumpscare 4:25
you should do a video on junko
8:15 - 8:22 Thomas The Tank Engine theme
No Cap I think Prince Loid deserves to be in the Asylum instead man's the definition of menace to society
Bruh put Eric Cartman in there next to her😊
Yall remember when Zuko knocked Azula off the blimp, causing her to fall to her death, and he thought he killed her only for her to use her crown to as a pick to stop her fall? TopG shit.
/POS, BUT WHAT WERE THE WRITERS ON WHEN THEY WERE WRITING AZULA
his hair was crazy to me seeing it for the first time
The next asylum member should be Anna nishinomiya from shimoneta
"A motherless psycho princess that is off a PERC!!!" I am fucking wheezing😭🤣
Adding in Azula and Toph were 2 of the big things that helped ATLA attain god status as a TV show
Fire nation city girls! lol😂 SKI YEE!
Azula was giving Kid Buu vibes. Was no talking, just straight up "I ain't getting bodied by a 11 year old where's my lightning blicky" ⚡️
🗣️POUND TOWN ❗️
🗣️SKYEE YEEEE
“this is why i made this series” do yall realize how insane this is ? i never heard bro say this nd look at the rest of his videos 😭😭
We need more of the asylum
You wanna see lightning nyuugah!?
I can fix her
14:24  What is this photo Gang🙏🏿😭🙏🏿😭🙏🏿😭🙏🏿😭🙏🏿😭😭😭😭🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿😭🙏🏿
Waiting for the Junko Enoshima psycho analysis 🙏🏾
When i was younger i had a huge crush on Azula, but Tylee was my favorite character. So when the boiling rock episodes premiered and Azula sent Mai and Tylee to jail my crush went away. And then I was just sad everytime she was on screen after that point because it was clear that she was just loosing her mind.
I still remember her reveal at the end of season one like it was yesterday. I said to myself “Huh. Zuko’s sister. That’s really cool.”   Season 2-3 showed us in the words of Zuko -   “That’s a problem”.   She definitely was. She was such a problem, the writers had to nerf her so she could be locked away, not even killed, just locked up.
ah yes my favorite fictional characters, soccer, kang, and katana
1:27 why the family feud bell 😭
23:46-I would recommend the "Azula in the spirit temple" comic. It is probably the closest Azula got to having a therapy session.
8:46-Girl,cut yo nails! 16:33-Imagine being a good looking girl and still having bad rizz! This is quite a feat! 20:14-Even that "neglected" stuff is a stretch. Mostly was just Azula not getting the attention she wanted for acting bad. This is just parenting 101,lol!Don't reward your kids for doing bad things!
4:29  nah but like can we talk about how cold this is? Bro not only redirected lightning but did it at point blank and still had enough energy to get out of there
Wait you forgot about Azula aways lies
Azula dont even need make up and she looks this  good but yet we have to remember the crazy to hot scale  😂😂😂😂
She's basically the Luca Blight (Suikoden) of Avatar.
7:00  15:10
CJ YOU ARE OC 😂😂😂😂 6:23 " Entertain me bitch !! " and Fire nation city Girls was hilarious " 6:55 "OMG girl about damn time get me the fuck outta this dirty ass city "😂😂😂😂
she got NO rizz.
Bro you have to make more of these
She was motherfucking insane
Broo lmfaoo the whole show my boy zoko just got Molly wapped I started feeling bad for bro like Yeo whyyy😭😭😭most the time shit was uncalled for too unprovoked 💀😭😭😭
8:57 is so funny😂😂😂😂😂😂
I can't wait to see the hisoka episode
An episode of The Asylum about Jinx from Arcane would be crazy
@13:24 is that... is that *Giratina* I hear?... My brother I see you have also been scarred by Legends Arceus 😭
This is her father’s fault. He is the one who made Azula the way she is.
I can fix her.
5:17 This made me die😂
This abridge version of Asuka is TFS Frieza level, how fucking on point it is lol
Azula might be crazy but she definitely get hit tho
8:20 a missed opportunity to roast Salazzle 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Objectively speaking her story is great.  Subjectively speaking, I don't like how she was handled in the comics. The 'Fire Siblings' are a textbook example of the two main methods kids use to survive in abusive households.  Zuko's method; being meek and submissive in nature to avoid any threats, perceived or not.  Azula's method; becoming useful to the abuser by emulating their characteristics.  And yet it's portrayed as the wrong choice, rather than what is likely her *only* choice. Let's not kid ourselves with modern ideas. The world of Avatar is inspired by various South Asian and Pacific cultures Pre-Enlightenment, and subsequently the idea of Human Rights, and civility. Azula was either going to be married off at a very young age, or killed by Zuko to solidify his claim to the throne by right of being the only living family member able to sit, as Iroh was in his twilight years, AND willingly abdicated his claim to the crown.  The Heir and The Spare, one is destined to die, the other to rule. A tale as old as the concept of leadership and power.  Also, can we talk about how horrifying a mental asylum in the Dark Ages would be? Shit dude, no wonder she spiraled even further, the staff probably have no clue what they're doing and are just making it up as they go.
8:12 that's beautiful
17:44 this would work on me
Too much funny bra🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The fire nation city girls 😂😂😂😂
Insane box is the best box.
according to avatar extras, the original scene where the guy says "we're taking the prisoners home" the guy didn't get knocked off the ship, azule outright INCINERATED him. like full on "gone, reduced to atoms"
I can save her
17:41 bro💀💀💀
Captain is so getting cooked by azula at 3:56 bro is cooked 😭
azula is crazy but she a hottie fr fr
You should do a OchiMaro
Entertain me BITCH had me dead😂
Aye broski don’t start no shit you can’t finish mane don’t only just give me azula I need more wtf 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🔥🔥🔥

14:23 is cursed as fxck 😂
Can’t wait for the Mark Hamill Joker episode that shit gon be fire.
Azula  D1 crash out was crazy asf ngl
The baddest character. She and Zuko should've fucked and made some pure bloodline mfs
Nah... If i was there, i could EASILY fix her. Goto my gofund me to donate to the cause of me being isekai'd ;).
Oh the choice of music was so peak Especially at 3:34 Like this was amazing
I still think my second favorite Azula moment is when she first meets Ty Lee at the Circus. You can immediately tell that Ty Lee is terrified of Azula and not exactly happy to see her which just tells you a LOT about Azula that even her friends are like "bitch is crazy and I want nothing to do with her." and she only joins reluctantly/out of fear. And it shows why she betrays Azula later.  Then my favorite moment is absolutely when she hallucinates her own mother telling her that she's loved and is like "nah, I'm not going to trust my own mind."
17:51 got that as my widget for years now😂
Ty lee is my child hood crush
what song is this https://youtu.be/BK-CD70oG7Y?t=864
HE BANISHED HER HAIR
I wonder when are we gonna see yoshikage
Azula, a D1 crashout in feminine form.
My simp ahh thought she was misunderstood 💀😭

17:44 something is clearly wrong with me cause I'm giving her BABIES!!😂😂😂😂
0:11 it was MEEEE. I'm the one who BOOMED that niqq@. 😂😂😂😂
Nah go to 17:44
"FIRE NATION CITY GIRLS"! CJ I'M WIT IT! XD
dave chappelle lol
Honestly, I am down BAD for Azula.
When I feel bad for her, all the adults in her life fail her and her  father, and he raised her to become a weapon. Zuko got a good ending, but she didn't. I wish we knew what happened to her in the legend of korra.
i can fix her
Kid me- I can fix her or destroy the world trying!
15:09
Damn it. He slipped on the Spilled Milk 😥 🥛 Why didn't we clean up the Spilled Milk? But in all seriousness, I really hope he gets better.
I can’t watch you at work bro, you have me evil giggling too much. Stahp being so funny 😫
hmmm >_>
22:45 THE CAPTIONS 💀
i already know theres some mf in the comments like "i can fix her" erm, no you cant??
When I woke up before the light thinking about tonight I can't sleep ozai said my dad ain't gon wake up to see the light and he no gon think about tonight and u most definitely will be asleep a little to sleep
“When he woke up he had hair!!” Dog got me crying in the office 😭
Coochie bandit 445 is crazy
Even if Azula didn't have firebending I'd still be scared of her
Love your channel when willl you do the Kira asylum video
17:56 I'm f*ckin dyin🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭😭💀💀💀💀💀💀
Azusa is 14 btw
why do you not do more of these
Are we getting patient number 2 or what?
We need to put iroh at the round table, bros a legend
We need as video on Zaheer
bro make a playlist of black shoes and asylum
Cj need to do hisoka or yoshikage Kira. Those mfs are crazy
Spawn slaps this bitch an says "what happened"?
Avatar has 1 of the 2 scenes from shows  from my childhood that leaves me shook every time.  1. Jiraya's death in Naruto 2. Aang taking electrical backshots from Azula.  And you wanna know something wild? They knew what they were doing because the story dropped heavy foreshadowing that if the Avatar got clapped in any way in the Avatar state it was ggs, roll credits, now Toph & Momo are the main characters now because it's goodnight sleep tight.. forevermore. 😭🤣😭
I’m ten months late but dang man, this video is funny af. All of your videos are. Keep it up 👍
You know its real when someone hits the Itachi pose. _Shawty is on a mission_
cj watch ajin
Hmm actually the pony tail was so ndeed a punishment inflicted on the chinese men by the Mongols.  People forget chinese m.en had long beautiful hair instead of the hideous utilitarian bowl cuts we see today.
@CJDACHAMP ay bro you should do that girl from that one gambling anime shes got a few screws loose
she fr turned into a crashout
i like that second serie
Loved this!
15:10 grandma no 😂
6:59
I hated aang. When azula zapped him I yelled out "yes!" While forgetting I was watching with my 8 year old sister who started crying 🤣
20:42 WHY DID CJ DO A GOOD IMPRESSION OF THIS POOR GIRL THO😔😔‼️‼️‼️
Do the Tokyo revengers black dragon and tenjiku arc
Why did you diss the baby?😂😭
I ain’t laughed so hard in my whole life - subscribed !!! 😭
sorry but tom toms hair looks like the tinder logo so do with that info how ever
Zuko's whole history with Azula _ALONE_ is the ultimate proof that the rich do, indeed, have problems.   Also Azula's near-murking of Aang means that she was technically THAT close to committing genocide without a care.
yo that of the childhood injury had me dead
lol the old ass ladies were not just her mentors but her aunts as well
Late but wanted to say that Azula’s mother broke her by saying she never hated her, she loved her.
Why did Azula go completely insane on her coronation day? It’s clear that Azula was insane the entire show, but why did she completely crack and hit a new low at the very end of the show, when she was about to become fire lord?
Azula rlly said  "why walk when u got servants" dam cruel fr 💀
another episode of the asylum?
Me studying Azula to learn how to become a bad bitch:
azula: oh hey the avatar is standing still and totally distracted azula:🔫
I just started to watch the series you are too funny I'm going to subscribe donate got to love this guy
13:49 shit looking like jjk
People just lucky Aang not aggressive like Korra 😂 cuz he would’ve been way more op
Manager CJ, we have another patient for rehabilitation.   Subject 002, Keyaru (Real name Keyaruga) from the redo of healer anime. We believe there will be no rehab for this sick freak, but we'll allow you to decide.
23:06 What is this sounds effect sounds like enraging demon 👁️👄👁️
16:50 so bad we had to pull out the facecam
DO KIRA PLSSSSSSSSSSSS
The noises are so damn peak "And katara just got JUMPED"  'WHOOOAH'  Slugged in the guts. Really makes Avatar feel like brutal shit
Song at 14:30 Name?

Hi
Hi
Azula is the Doja Cat of cartoons.
"SHE SNUFFED THEM HOES!"
WE NEED MORE ASYLUM... WHERE ARE THE CRAZY B*TCHES CJ??????🤣🤣🤣 Loved your last video on Donquixote Doflamingo. XD
MOM WAKE UP CJ DROPPED!!!
Gods im realizing that if nick gave the creators of this show maybe one more season this shit would have been even more fire then it already was and i hope that they dont get jerked around like they did with korra but dont get me wrong korrra is okie not to the level of the last air bender but it was good
Imagine azula as slade's right hand
I can fix her
I can fix her
1:00 does this mean you’re gonna cover junko?  DOES THIS MEAN YOU’RE GONNA COVER JUNKO?????
Nice to see you give Avatar The Last Airbender some attention 😁👍
Azula at the party was the opposite of "scaring the hoes"    She scaring the bros
Need to cover jinx in this.  Great new series
How do you make these videos? I’m confused how u remember every part of the episode
Her rizz was so bad he couldn't do a voice over
I would make her worse. I def like crazy women.
7:54 what’s the name of this stage music
Finally, i found you after 3 years
I still want an Azula 😢
I can fix her.
wtf was the pic that was on his grave
always funny as ever, I had agood laughs. Azula is a real psycho, but deep down I think she envied her friends, all she lived for was to impress her father
Azula actually wifey tho ❤
Do this new content for as many as you can please
i have 0 and i mean 0 bitches and my rizz is still better than hers
Devontedaone gave azula therapy so she's fine
I hope you do a video on Junko Enoshima.
Tom tom got that 2002 ronaldo nazario cut
Aye yo Can we get CJ to do a video on Mashle? The absolute disrespect in that show is ridiculous. 🎉
JUNKO OUT OF ALL PEOPLE?!?
I need to see one on Toph. Shes not crazy but boy is she SAVAGE
You forgot the confession part
Azula got done dirty. The most bullsht scripted lose in history.  Then she getting hoed by this awful writing in this new Avatar show. 😭
🥚
Bro nah beach episode when it reached the party bro omg I was in tears😭
take yo percs pleeeee
"I can fix her"
Bro you funny as hell I’m subbing
She's not the emperor's daughter she his mistress Nickelodeon change that part of the story for obvious reasons
3:13 it actually is
he should do a video focusing on kazutora from tokyo revengers
10:00 the fact that she was after “hit” by all four elements
4:30ish surely after this, she killed the captain I'd imagine 😅?( Haven't seen the show in over a decade and know that aang is the mc lol I'm guessing like Goku, he just want a good fade)
I don’t think bill would beat Aku
I don't care what no body says, Azula stood on business and I completely support ALL of her decisions.
Azusa L rizz
this funny as shit 😂😂😂
Exactly my type of girls
I forgot how much of a crackhead she was.
i can fix her
Jjj
1:40 Azula was crazy but she was a menace. She was a threat to everyone 😂
Bruh I watched ATLA and TLOK all within a month and you just refreshed my memory fo
We need more asylum episodes
Okay honey zazu
Jinx from arcane when?
15:03  17:51  17:55
Cj Dachamp What’s the song in the background in 14:20
More of these vids
14.20 time what song?
Why my man zokuo folded like that😅
she said fuck those anime rules and fuck those kids
Lmao 🤣😂 yooooo that MW2 reference was funny and accurate as fuck
This is the first video of yours I have seen, but I can already tell I’m in for the Longrun I just subscribed
Anyone know the name if the instrumental at 7:51 ?
Could you do a video on ozai please.
😅
Actually the ponytail means you lost an agni Kai humbled and destroyed
Excellent video
Next on the asylum list:  -Jinx (Arcane)  -Light Yagami -Hisoka -Toga Himiko -Kid Gaara -Junko
u should do kuvira
16:46 I completely forgot about this 😭, where’d she learn this from ☠️
15:10 🤔🧐🤔🤔🧐
This bitch was CRAZY
22:57 That's a wrap
She tried killing her OWN MOTHER in the comics 💀
Azula was put here off a Synthetic Perc
Quality content. 👏🏽
I could fix her
I swear azula the only person in anime to have L rizz
3:25 It really goes to show that she was thoroughly damaged when her very first appearance is this. The only other person who was smiling was freaking ZHAO! sure, the other military big wigs aren't looking away, but they're at least being stoic and not smiling while watching their king blowtorch their prince. While said prince refused to raise a hand against their king. It's why Aang fixing her sits wrong with me. Even ignoring all the craziness and further deterioration in the comics before she magically got over being a monster thanks to Aang, the damage went too deep.  And of all the people she wouldn't listen to, Aang is very near the top of that list.
That over grown salamander was actually a mongoose lizard😂😂😂
Should do light next
Azula shooting fire out her mouth looked like Godzilla
Azula rizzing be like😂😂😂😂😂
I forgot the sonic song at 7:52
17:00 can we talk about the guy to the rights hair cut like huh?!
14:20 What’s The Song In The Background
14:20. What’s The Song In The Background
14:20 What’s The Song In The Background
14:20 What’s The Song In The Background
14:20 What’s The Song In The Background
14:20 What’s The Song In The Background
14:20 What’s The Song In The Background
At 14:24 what’s the name of the song?
that thomas the train shi had me dead😭
She can get it 🤫🧏
I have watched so much Azula R34 that she is my favorite character
7:03 that bass boost gave me like pulses on my heart jeez 😅
Her rizz was in the negatives.
coochie bandit is insane
That last scene of azula always had been just a "i feel bad yeah lowkey it needs too be a stray jacket but dude thats not kewl"
Long feing 🤡
Aye man. If u need a muscle man impression. I’m available 😂😂. Awesome ass video bro
idk why but her having the Dai lee under her controll was so cool and thats why it was so frustrating when she bannished them
The way you say about Azula is so damn funny please make a video talk about Ozai too
Song name ???
8:38 High Noon
3:24 If you do math, Azula was technically 11 YEARS OLD when this happened 😵
17:03 NOT THE POLAR EXPRESS😂
GLOOMYASSS
16:59 XD
Yo why he say shit like that🤣😂
Lol just going to say crazy chicks can be fun for awhile
The baby got that reverse zuko cut
Ik yall thought you could fix her too
She’s 14, let that sink it.
Happy fact: Azula eventually rehabilitated herself (in the official avatar cook book), her part of the book says “May is one of the only people who is able to coax me into writing these types of things”, which means she’s on good terms with a few people. Her character development isn’t even shown yet it’s already on par with zuko in terms of interest
17:48 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 17:57 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Orachimaru nextt
If someone know the name of the ost when Azula chase aang and buumi???
Bro azula bad af let me change her 🙏
"Look at this last spike.. *BOOM*" I CANT😭😭
AZULA DID 200 IN HEAD🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Azula still remains the best villlainess even though shes a menace
17:33, that's...... might be Kuwabara voice right?😂😂
The fact that she was only 14 going through all this is sad
What's the music during tje triple threat match?
need me a girl like azula 😩
Team Azula's intro music hits HARD!!!
can you cover the red lotus next specifically zaheer bro was brutal
Ah yes. Bo3 shadows of evil really nice theme to end off with👍
Zuko: "Heard you talkin shit bitch" 😂😂😂😂
aye question what anime is Sick Bish from the beginning from
do hisoka next lol
um the round table is missing the rizz king
14:55 had me dead
Nah Azula is crazy. Time to drop a ⬆️➡️⬇️⬇️⬇️🦅🦅🦅 on her
the Tweak meter
Fun fact: In the Greek dub of avatar Kataras name was changed to "Tamara" because Katara in Greek means curse
17:45 Is that a wwe theme
Cannot forget sokka the back bender
iwh339
Stop using nigga as a word of a pression it's a word of power now get the memo
Nah Younger sister beating up her older brother is insane (Azula is 14 and Zuko is 16)
We need an episode 2 of the asylum
I love how you acknowledge, that the betrayal of Mei And Ty Lee, was the turning point of Azula’s sanity. Most people just sum it up to the pressure of her becoming the new fire lord. But I honestly think she began to spiral right after that moment.
Ozai should be on the table😂😂😂
Azula fr a crashout 😭😂
The best thing about this is the black ops 3 zombie music brings back so many memories
14:05 some Eren Yeager type shit right here.
Yuno Gasai from Mirai Niki
Don't forget zuko probably has ptsd of the name agni kai sooooo
'Thats why i started this series'
Let's not forget how azulu mocked her friends and brother during their campfire confessions
If she ain’t this crazy I don’t want her
I could listen this guy all my life and i will be happy.
No, they had a nerve my girl toph so Azula could land  that hit on Iroh that’s wild
All I had to say... I was thinking this video was going to be serious... And boy was I wrong. But I lmao so hard
Yo is it just me or was azula to op?
6:21 "ENTERTAIN ME BITCH!!!"
Do rimuru from that time i got reincarnated as a slime next for the table
This young woman's *NOT* a competent member of government: banishment is NOT what she should want to ever use; especially if she sees someone as a personal adversary: then she *absolutely* wants them close to her if she's in any way *smart*. The reason: if you have them constantly in your sight: they cannot give you any nasty surprises, especially one that could or would be fatal to you.
9:07  had me howling
12:57 what she said in the actual show was even more disrespectful
Bro adding the Donkey Kong 64 music, let's fucking go
You forgot the fact that the reason she told her dad that zuko killed the avatar (aang) was because she knew he wasn't dead so when he came back zuko would be shamed instead of her
Azula the only one who can kill someone mid animation transformation
I can fix her deadass
i can fix her
Azula is the og crashout
De vil from 101 Dalmatians live action version
De vil from 101 Dalmatians live action version
De vil from 101 Dalmatians live action version
Apparently they confirm she actually gets redeemed
I’d marry her if I could lightning bend.
what azula did to tai lee is just a normal broship
I really think you should look into Ogata from Golden Kamuy for this kind of insanity review. Some of the stuff he does is crazy.
its been fk azula
The narrator reminds me of Frank the Plant from Harley Quinn
would you smash azula tho ?
Y’all applauding for azula while someone like that will betray you and end your whole family in less of a heartbeat. That is a monster through and through
the cod bo3 music at the end got me remanising bout the old days bro
I love Azula
Azula might be the only villain with a brain here 14:15 just shoot his dumbass like why tf you waiting for them to finish transforming
23:10 you know theyve gone absolutely berserk if they got CJ stuttering
For the next episode of the asylum should look into Adam smasher a the boogie man of NC
I haven’t hollered out laughing in a good minute🎉
Ok ok HEAR ME OUT. I think i can fix her
Can we all take a moment to remember that dis girl is a freaking 14 year old throughout the entire show. Damn thats insane 💀
9:55 got me crying bc she really attacked an elderly person (her fucking uncle) and dipped 😭😭
I can fix her
I love this series already
6:15 "ENTERTAIN ME BITCH"😅😅
Patient #00 gotta be Joker and harley the Psych
Azula unfortunately started my attraction to crazy women. Had the biggest crush on her as a kid.
All I’m saying is that Suki was running a mismatched iso and she still pulled out some d’s, give her a damn break
Okay Gigan Rocks suited that azula-aang chase scene perfectly
Bro I like her, always thought she was hot lol
I can fix her.
Lol!
Theme at 9:04?
We need a video on Johan Liebert from Monster.
Ngl we have to get the joker in here someday
I been said she need to be in Arkham Asylum. 🤣🤣
Sane azula would have bodied zuko & katara ngl
Why is his Azula's impression so on point😂😂😂😂 gah damn😂
According to the writers, Azula was supposed to get an arranged marriage somewhere in the series presumably in Book 3 but had to cut it because it didn't fit in the flow of the story. Can you imagine the torment she would've put her would be husband through?
I think it's a shame that we didn't see Azula in The Legend of Korra. It would've been nice to see how she really lived her life after the ATLA and the search for Ursa.
Azula's defeat is simultaneously the greatest and most heartbreaking moment in the series.
"Fire nation city girls" is crazy😭😭😭😭
Azula made me realize something If a character JUST like Azula was created in modern day, people would call her a mary sue and hate her to death, and then once she starts her decent into madness, people would call it "the writers correcting their initial mistake."
When will you do shadow from the Eminence in shadow
Hahahha my favourate review channel
I'm not saying " I can fix her" but call me Bob the builder
9:38 Sonic in Mario is such a crazy ass statement fr
Yo I know u do like cartoons and anime but need to do one on Rick grimes
#RIPBOZO👎😂👎 14:24
Azula be like: I can do it again 😂 10:43
Azula is really her daddy's sun 😂 (Zuko was just the spare son)
"And Azula's rizz.. is absolutely TERRIBLE!" 😂
I can fix her!
now that we have cj dachamp talk about metal fusion beyblade, we need to talk about tsubasa in the second season, bro was UNHINGED
Iroh needs a video. Asap.
She reminds me of desler from sby ngl
I rewatched this video after the mahito video and i used the same rules as that video. Azula a got level 10 with no stars
hear me out tho...
My man pulled out my favorite track from sonic rides zero gravity for Azusa surfing. That alone earns my sub.
Iroh - "If we get caught in the Earth kingdom, we get executed. But if we go to the Fire nation, we get handed over to Azula."  Iroh and Zuko - "Earth kingdom it is."
6:59
Please may everyone watching be blessed and remember that God forgives all your sins no matter how in too deep you are
7:00 😂😂😂
Honestly azula could have melted the chains 💀
i can fix her
Since the rules have Changed, I am going to Re-tally Azula's Sanity Meter. I made a few changes to how she can rack up Points Since nobody really dies in Avatar.  Diabolical/ Unhinged Behavior  - +1/2 Loss of Sanity - +1/2 Putting someone in a Pack - +1 Multi-Pack: +1  AZULA  Crimes:  Unhinged Behavior +1/2 Manipulation: Zuko and Iro + 1 Diabolical Behavior +1/2 Packin up Iro +1/2 Unhinged Behavior +1/2 Packin up the Kyoshi Warriors +1 Manipulating the The Earth King +1 Multi-Pack: +2 (2x) Diabolical Behavior +1 Threatening Mai +1/2 (5x) Unhinged Behavior +2 & 1/2 Loss of Sanity +1/2 Packin up Zuko +1 Loss of Sanity +1/2 Diabolical Behavior +1/2  Results:  TOTAL POINTS  14  SANITY METER  Level: 10  Stars: 3
Even now I'd still smash Azula, that hasn't changed at all.
Whole time watching avatar when she had no social skills and even as she descended into madness I was sitting there thinking, I can fix her
17:52 he do look like Tim from Tim and Moby *i wanna see how many of yall know exactly what I'm talking about*
Could you imagine her having an inferiority complex towards Zuko….. oh wait #netflix
She is that crazy ass baddie
14:24 BRO WHY DO YOU HAVE THIS PIC OF ANGG
The choice in number at the end of coochie bandit 💀
pickle is in the table cj an are you going to add levi ackerman
This swear her risk mentally scarred me 💀
Team Azula was NOT the one to be triflin' with. 🙅‍♂
She ain't got rizz she got zzir
I love this video 😂
Anyone know the anime from 1:00 its for research purposes
Jesus loves you
Just be careful she may try to manipulate her way out of the asylum i hear shes pretty good at it 😅
Hay did you do the BLEATCH video about the captain that love fighting?
bro omg hilarious
4:00 fun fact about this scene, originally when this gaurd fk'd up and said 'Prisoners' the original Idea was that Azlua was going to VAPORIZE him on the spot, but they couldn't do that.
😂😂😂😂😂 the way cj said gloomy ass
Katara was lucky in their last fight, imagine getting blasted with thunder to the face, under Sozins Comet 💀💀
did anyone hear tsb genos ?
I would be put in the asylum
Is there more
What happened to Azula? She became a victim of her over achiever issues.
Never and I mean NEVER let azula become a mom
Now when tf orochi be at
do junko from dangdangrompa all sesons
fighting w her hair is crazy 😂
Her attempt at rizz is just.......something.
And iroh is weak to electric type moves.
Man was brave enough to throw shade at Legend of Korra, in 2023.
cj what did u watch avatar on
The Round Table is missing that Magician from Hitman Reborn the one thats on Sunas squad but is literally never there until he wants to be there
fire nation 'city girls' got me 😭😭
I love how insane she is like honestly, I can just imagine her just saying HIII BHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA BLOODDDD-
Bro her last battle already made the scale jump from one to top 😅
Have fun with Junko when you get to...all that.
Can someone please tell me what song what used in this video when Team Azula was made
“Azula, didn’t I tell you to stay away from dr*gs”. 💀
6:45 glad that the gaslighting her friend after endangering their lives deserved double the points Ty Lee was the perfect baddie...you dont anything like that to her
ya know ya should make a second yt acount for the asylum only i would sub to that any day
22:00
pls do part 2
What the soundtrack at 4:04
Bro your face after her pick up line took me out 🤣great video.
zuko was break dancing in that scene ❤
To be honest Zuko won that fight. Katara popped up on the screen for no reason lol. She is the stands for all of the fight but then decides to come into frame for what reason????
“I can save her”😂
what is the anime that got the psycho girl with her tongue out throwing up her set
I would say I could fixer but honestly whats wrong with her is way hotter
ngl I never realised how crazy azula was. I thought she was just misundestood, but now...? Still hot though, I'd tap.
Azula ass was so crazy Iroh and Zuko would rather the Earth Kingdom execute them than get turned over to her alive.
"ENTERTAIN ME B*TCH"😭
azula  was hittin combos in that volley ball game
And azula died to his brother
What about ang killing the fire lord
Well yeah as smoking indoors is illegal unless your at a designated smoking room, but medicines shouldn’t be the ones to press charges not your problem
Is a Junko Enoshima video coming up?
9:07 💀💀💀💀
She is hot
You should def make an episode for jinx from arcane
You cooked with this one jeez
Chainsaw man do chainsaw man
10:41 why is it always the crazy ones that are mad flexible  ( >_>)
You should have also added what she did in the comic.😮
Cj you gotta do something on the goblin slayer
just hear me out i could fix her i swear
The building in the background is that mount massive?
So while I can't say I have the same spring of knowledge as CJ, but I did want to try and see if his scoring system would have been for Azula last time since he did "update the scoring" with this latest episode.  -Watching her brother's face get cooked and smiling: +1/2 -Ty Lee's performance with her commanding the net to be set on fire and unleashing the animals: +1/2 -Cooking Iroh and leaking Zuko broken: +1/2 -Taking out the Kioshi Warriors (pretty sure they were captured, but since I we don't see a good chunk of them, I'm willing to count that as a +2 since Last Airbender didn't go too crazy with the kills. Or not like Korra) and then taking over the city while outsmarting Lex Luthor: 1/2 -Turning Zuko to her side in spite of Iroh trying to convince him to not side with her (would also give another 1/2 point to her basically blackmailing Zuko by giving him credit for Aang's downfall, but I'll be generous and say: 1/2. Speaking of Aang...) -Bug Zapping Aang when he was going into his Avatar state: +1 -Stomping out a sand castle and treating a game of volleyball like it a Call of Duty MP game: +1/2 -Azula at the party and her talking up a guy and her social skills being treated like WE WILL RULE THE KINGDOM AND BURN DOWN THIS WORLD TO ASH! Also trashing the guy's house. +1/2 -After getting backpoked by her girls, she sends them to jail. She was going to send the warden to the boiling water down below, but clearly she didn't much care for that plan: +1/2 -Remember the "Burn this world to ash!" part? Yeah, her plan to get on daddy's good side: 1/2 -Banishing someone because of a cherry seed: 1/2 -Banished her protection because they were late: 1/2 -She eventually talking to her mom in the mirror: 1/2 -And to max out the gauge: the Fight against Zuko and Katara basically caused her to snap: 1/2  So yeah, I like to think Azula still reached the max level of 10. Again, took some liberties with what happened with the Kioshi Warriors, but she deserves to be at that max level. Still, I dont' know if we can give her "bonus stars" but I guess we can give a few for what happens in the comics maybe...
What’s the name of the girl on 1:01 and what anime is she from?
When is the next Asylum video coming CJ 🤨
When is the next one come CJ 🤨
Do Light Yagami next !!!
She kinda bad tho
Azula is 50% of the writing quality of this show. Zuko is the other 50%.
TOASTYY🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
this guy is making me laugh like crazy🤣🤣🤣
Ur videos  are the best bro much love ❤️ 😂😂😂
Tai Lee smash
20:40  First time I've heard Cohen's Masterpiece used in a video outside of BioShock related content. Nice
Sir Cj you've done it again amazing work sir
Kiryu Setsuna from Kengan Ashura should be next. He's perfect for this category
She's not even old enough to drink and she already has the tyranny of a seasoned veteran dictator.
I can fix her
Like an old school MW2 lobby 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Tai li is a baddie
No, you cannot fix her.
So if Aang was technically dead but the spirit water revived him we could get more interesting stuff in the next series… they might pull a “the avatar cycle was never lost” kinda thing lol
Azula was my favorite character and still is.
Azula is in my top 10 of black air force energy hall of fame lol
Myne from shield hero needs to be on this
thank you bro for being funny n entertaining af i appreciate you heavy
8:55 I died
what juice wrld be singin bout
"weird niggas that be fuckin with hands" and now watchu mean by that cus u callin me that cus i do that shit 5 times a day
Her Rizz is out of this world
Feel bad for zuko
I cant wait to see some other crazy asses show up in here. Especially Kira.. he will be fun.
game on as it should be 16:20
Whenever i saw katabitch yapping i'd get so irritated 😂 she was cringe too
Bro looks like Fairplay from Streetbeef💚
azula could low key take it
This is one character I can’t imagine being a kind hearted selfless person.
First, and basically, the entirety of Gotham city had me laughing, my ass off! Second, I can’t wait for the next patient. Third, I have a request for a character, and it’s probably something nobody here will expect, can you do the character Tyrian Callows from RWBY?
Id still smash azula.....
Ay cj you gonna do light yagami from death note??
Bro, put my Fortnite profile picture in the video
We need a Hiskoka video lol
I kid you not I stopped mid vid(where Azula destroys the volleyball court) just had to say that this hands down is the funniest video and best that you’ve made! You can really tell that he has so much fun making these videos. Happy holidays, now back to watching the rest of this comedy gold
Bro forgot to include the crazy shit she did in avatar legend of kora
Im freakin cryin this video got me rollin
damn she got daddy issues
His Azula voice literally kills me 😭🙌💀
Azula is my top favorite character along with her uncle  i'm sorry they not even main character and they was cooking  i wish azula was redeemable but her father damage her good she too far gone sadly.
Do yuno from Future Diary next
That Kira episode gonna go hard tho
More asylum episodes please
Azula pulled an eren Yeager
7:03 why does mei look like the leader of azula’s crew
she was a psychotic crazy a** but also one of the best written characters I've come across. Like the character was executed beyond perfect. They understood the assignment with her
She made me uncomfortable as she went insane
6:21 "ENTERTAIN ME BIYATCH!!!!!!" bro😭😭😭😭shi KILLED me
Aye cj put mahito ass in the asylum asap (like if you agree)
You should do a joker video
That girl when he said mays gloomy ass can ruin my life
Do kira next from jojo bizare adventures
7:01 skeeyee 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wheres your reaction vid to the aot final parts, as well as tokyo revngers s2 and 3
Damn, Azusa really Eren’d Aang!
15:10 music please 🙏🥺
13:20 Giratina revival theme? there was no better OST for this moment
TOKYO REVENGERS PART 3
The Beach episode is where i kind of felt sad for Azula
Reccomend betelguese from re zero
gotta do mayuri
The next fiend put in the asylum should most DEFINITELY be Light Yagami because that nigga is a MANIAC‼️‼️
is this avatar or avatar something something full name pls
Please make more of these vids
Do a vid on bersek
I don't know why, but azula is just my type of woman 😌👌
Homelander for the kiddos.
Not calling it the "handy dandy sanity scanner" was a miss.
Azula the reason why I love my women toxic as hell
If I can nominate a crazy fool for the asylum, marik from Yu-Gi-Oh
15:32 Don't blame BOTH her parents. Azula's mom WANTED to spend more time with her, but Ozai wouldn't allow it, because he saw Azula as a weapon
I think azula should alsobe on the blacktable she was a whole menace
even after all that...i still would
Azula saw Eren take out the Warhammer titan and took notes
love the Insanity meter
I can fix her
The hardest line of Azula was said to Long Feng: "Don't even flatter yourself, you were not even a player" 💀 He got cooked by a 14 year old
Yep, though what happened to her after the comics though. Plus who's next on the take on the Asylum?
I love this dudes videos man haha
Not Gonna Lie, I'd be folding to Azula... : (
Wish we got more episodes of cooking with fire by Azula & Zuko
BRUH THE CHILL MUSIC TO FFX AT 17:44 JUMPSCARED ME
U should post typa videos on Friday then call it freaky Friday
Bet those people either get hella paided or they don't get paided at all
Also I don't give a damn. I would be Azula's man. It's tough but toxic b's be having the best. She would call Mr.Lick. Daddy Longstrokes and Favored Consort.😅 simp for Azula or die.
I'm not even gonna lie, this is one of the best videos I've ever seen. Not only how you broke down Azula's character and arc well and in such a funny way, but the whole structure of this video and your humor is just amazing. Really well done.
—————-rizz
Azula lowkey was puttin the Vicky Mendoza diagram through its paces. Like you first see her, she’s hotter than she is crazy. But by the end of it, she was too crazy for it to be passable.
He should do the grinch
The muscle man part killed me😂😂😂
And then zukos dumb ass just ran in there and fell 😂
Cj you are the best
MY KINDA LOOOOOVVEEEEEEE
Nah Junko gotta be next 💀 she basically caused the end of the world, killed her sister and she has multiple personalities because she’s bored 🤦🏻‍♂️
Also the girls from Higurashi Gou
Cj need to do Yuno Gasai from Mirai Nikki 😂😂😂 that bitch crazy
What's also surprising alot of people now is that Azula is getting a redemption arc in the new Avatar comics. I don't know too much about it but alot of people are hating on the idea of her even having a sliver of humanity which makes me sick to my stomach. Ive watched too many case studies on Azula's descent to complete madness and the fact that shes 14 (barely even a teenager) makes her insanity even worse because it might take her longer to fully recover from all the trauma she's dealt with from birth.   (Sorry to rant about this, i just truly hate when people don't want to see actual troubled and damaged ppl, fictional or real, not want to get the help they need and deserve)
Walking menace to society

Bro if you doing crazy no one better then the joker and junko I'll help with that lmao !!!!
toji fushiguro black air force activity is radiating
I always low-key felt bad for azula tho even way back then, cause as crazy as she was her parents are kinda to blame for it
I'm currently hearing gunshots
Legends say he went to the bathroom and never came back
I've never been more disappointed at someone's riss
She sounds like Elizabeth Afton

We need a Tokyo revengers video for real  there 2 new seasons since last video
I hope your okay it's been a minute
where is garou
If I can recommend Asylum patients, i would like to put forward Light Yagami. Bro went from model student to crazy serial killer.
She is way worse in comics. Its crazy
You should do a video about uncle iroh
When are you gonna add fleet way sonic to the round table
Azula was crazy crazy once they locked her in a room a rubber room, a rubber room of rats and rats make her crazy
How come luffy wasn’t in the usual intro in the pickle video like the rest?
I swear avatar the last airbender wasn't anime it was a documentary 😢
i think there's someone who you havent probably heard of, and before you diss it, hear me out. LORD TIREK from MLP has black air force energy. He put fear in the literal embodiment of the sun and moon. He deserves a trial for the spot at the roundtable of black air forces.
LES GOOOOOOOOO WE GON BE DOIN KIRA SOON
Tokyo revengers season 2 and 3 are out
istg i can't wait for you to do junko put her in max sercurity

invincible seaaon 2  come out !!!!!
Should put Nezuko on the round table
He should definitely do a video like this on the Lich from adventure time
LMAO 14:50 😂🤣
React to the ending of aot please
what's crazy is that in the comics Azula actually mentally recovers after finding out their mom isn't dead and then starts the Anbu Black Ops of the Fire Nation (Kemurikage) because Zuko was like "As long as you're not mentally insane you can do whatever the hell you want because I can't stop you"
Deep down, Azula knew her mom loved her, but her pride wouldn't let her accept that. She can only see herself as a monster.
toji fushigoro
updated version of yujiro hanma into the round table maybe add baki ? thoughts thoughts?
Ty Lee's waist is crazy
He needs to do MD-02 from MD Geist, you can't get a more pure example of black airforce energy.

You said when the rest of jjk gets animated you'd do a part two of sukana
video idea: hisoka menace to society
Idk if Light Yagami would be fitting for The Asylum. What y’all think?
Gilgamesh from the Fate series should be at the roundtable
Cj do Cid from the eminence in shadow
Ayo highly recommend yuno in the asylum and also PUT AKAINU IN BLACK AIR FORCE cause bro packed up ace and wanted smoke with white beard luffy and others and he even killed a marine 😂
We still need that vegeta vid seeing as his been tested by one of the other round table members
Someone that needs to be put in an asylum is shredder or Griffith
I need an episode of my wife Yuno
I'm glad Azula seems to be healing in the comics while still remaining as evil as before and becoming more dangerous if anything.
Make a video to day
Itachi?
I think I could fix her
Hmmmmm- Does Levi from AOT deserve a trial for the black air force table or for the asylum??? :0
We need aizen a true menace
You are epic

Put light yagami here
Anyone else not get the notification for this?
Brauh what happened to AoT?

YOU FELLD BAD FOR AZULA!!??
I would love to see a video on Diavolo from Jojo part 5, the mafia menace
Do eneru off one piece
please do a jin kariya video next.
CJ you have got to give a look at the show “Ragna Crimson” that is some INSANITY I would love to see how you process. Either mc’s could easily have a video of their own but crimson specifically is a whole other level
The next guy you should do is tai lung from kung fu panda
I have idea of another menace of anime from the Naruto Franchise he's the most racist, manipulative and Uchiha hater that's right, his name is Danzo Shimura and he's literally the high level racist savage forcing Itachi to killing his own breathin' and hungry for power, and working with many enemies (especially during the wars), the man who hates happiness and peace while as leader of the roots of the foundation, he teaches them to suppress their emotions instead of embracing them and stole the many Sharingan of all the Uchiha he killed even took Shisui Uchiha's Sharingan and secretly working with the Akatsuki, Orochimaru & Hanzo the Salamander but was then killed by Sasuke Uchiha along with Karin Uzumaki who he betrayed and working with Tobi to finish him off to avenge his brother and clan. Danzo Shimura was part of Team Tobirama along with Hiruzen Sarutobi and were rivals of taking the title of Hokage (even hates the Tsunade & Jiraiya along with Hiruzen since the were in Team Hiruzen in the past too). This makes him worthy of joining The Roundtable of Black Air Force Activity, he's racist savage, no he's the hungry powered ultimate menace of the Hidden Leaf Village and Shinobi World of the Naruto Universe.
Does anyone know what that sound effect is when azula gets kicked off the ship from at 4:31
Yo cj do takamura vs hawk
Only a matter of time till he discovers cid Kagenou

Bro there's no way that Adonis from kingdom of ruin isn't in the next few episodes of this series lol
Good to have more of your content.
CJ I'm still waiting on that 2003 shredder vid
I’m asking for you just to cover spec from Baku he might have some black air force energy just trust me
TOJI or gojo vid when?
I can fix her.
You NEED to nominate... Adam mother fucking Smasher
Yo cj sukuna vid when?
17:45 this mf used otherworld. Why???
Seeing Azula's feats laid out back to back like this non-stop actually is fucking nuts. She really pulled off some wild shit in this series and it all seems earned. Not a single ass-pull.   And she's not a Mary Sue because she has glaring flaws and gaps in her talents and personality traits. It's just that all of her good traits are specifically set to make her a perfect antagonist.
PLEASE DO TOJI FROM JUJSTU!!!
Yo CJ, JJK's Shibuya incident just ended can't wait to see Sukuna on the round table
Bro needs to make a round table video for Toji. Bro has ZERO respect for anyone.
Are we sure she don't belong on the round table? She sound like she belong on the roundtable.
cj what are you doing there's a whole new season and episodes of Tokyo revengers the round table finna expand
It ain’t no one want azula I’ll take her
I’d humbly like to request sukuna for the round table of black Air Force energy
CJ u need to watch jjk right now bro sukana is on a madness
If this new series continues, i really hope that esdeath (from akame ga kill) comes into this series at one point. She a freaky one fr
shibuya is almsot done, sukuna deserves a vid
i can fix her
Please do accelerator next. He can be insane or a villain.
azula does all this lookin so damn find too
whens sukuna getting on the roundtable?
I love part when bro iron started throwing hands
yo you said in a other video that once the new season was animated you would do a whole video on sukuna so do it
CJ !!!! You have to put sukuna on the table with the new stuff he could take Buu's place
Yo Cj I finally got a YouTube account 🗣
Nah nah nah nah you gotta do the shibuya incident my boy, SUKUNA LITERALLY KILLED THOUSANDS IN 5 SECONDS
BRO CJ I NEED YOU TO GET ON KINGDOM OF RUINS IMA REPOST THIS MANY TIMES
You should really make a black airforce energy video about Taiju Shiba from Tokyo revengers he was a straight up menace💀
AM SORRY.BUT IF YOU DON'T GET ON THAT ROASTY CHAIR AND START COOKING! THAT SAKUNA DID I'M COME UP TO YOUR CRIB AND!
This guy is funny 😂😂🤣
I just realized, Azula is the first bitch and cartoon in general that interrupted a God-tier ascension mid it's transformation. Bruh, the balls to do it is unthinkable. 👌😂
We need yuri next for black air forces
XD
Yea bro. Her dad is rich but she level 5 crazy
Next up, Yuuichi from Tomodachi Game
When u making  A gear 5 video
Suguru from JJK needs to be the next asylum patient, he got some screws loose himself, dude started a cult.
Sukuna gotta be next
Kenpachi vid when?
Name of song at 7:51?
Where is Toji in the round table CJ ya slacking😭😭😭
Ngl azula had the craziest bag out of all firebender. She could do it all zuko lucky azula mental
Hey I’ve got some really great news to share with you, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on a cross and resurrected on the third day so you may all have eternal life. If you believe and repent of your sins and put your faith and trust in Him as you would a parachute jumping off a plane at 25000 feet up in the air, He will give you eternal life in heaven as a free gift and I promise you, He will change your life forever as He did mine. He is the ONLY way to heaven and He loves you all. Please think deeply about this with urgency because this is your eternal life and soul, you don’t know when you could die, meaning you could die at any moment, so please consider this with all your heart. If anyone tells you that Jesus isn’t the only way, they are lying to you and they don’t care about your future.
He should do a video on Dark Vader
All she needed was love man..I feel like if bro on that island looked pass her bad attempt at flirting and actually tried to get to know her and show her someone could actually care about her and not her abilities I’m sure she’d go through that same metamorphosis like zuko did and change her ways. It’s really sad 😔
Mr. Dachamp, I think it would be an undoubtably exquisite thought to compose a review of comedic variety and indomitable humor on the subject of a trial for the absolute menacing and imposing foe know by the name “sukuna” and his case against the good fellow jogo.
Reverse Flash gotta be in here
😅 check out the eminence in shadow forreal the level of disrespect is epic
do aizen next
Where Toji at
14:26 what that song

Ayo cj why Killiua anit in the round table yet bro we need a Killiua exhibit
Bro u u gotta add toji to the table he a crazy from juju kaisen
She kinda bad though
No honorable mention of Sheogorath? That sort of negligence is the kind of thing that makes the Mad god an entirely different kind of MAD! The not so pleasantly fun kind of MAD, if you know what I mean.
You knew she was different when even iroh thought she was too far gone to save. He said "no. She's crazy and she needs to go down."
Azula W villian ngl
It’s bin two week champ sup 👀
Tell me you finna do a video on Yoshikage Kira ONG
Sukuna Sukuna Sukuna Sukuna Sukuna Sukuna Sukuna Sukuna Sukuna Sukuna Sukuna Sukuna Sukuna Sukuna Sukuna Sukuna

Bro has beef with tom-tom
That will be a fantastic series for sure!! I can't wait to see some of my favourite cuckoo characters there!! 😆
17:41 what's the name of the song?? Metal gear rising?
I mean if katara flashed zuko a smile and a you might get some booty wink azula might have been up shit creek.
Do a black air Force for toji or do something for sukuna that would be epic no cap
If Azula Was a Cod Zombie She Would Be a Verruckt Sprinter
Put toji in the Black air force round table.
Cj i got a vid idea for bfa do taiju from tokyo revengers

Off topic, and ik this is the asylum but we need that man Sukuna added to the roundtable immediately

Zyouh the world got black Air Force energy
1:40   2:02   3:03   3:50  4:00  6:18 7:03 7:11 7:41  7:45  9:05   9:31  10:41    11:37  14:07  15:07  16:04 16:21 16:53  16:59 17:43  19:38 20:31 21:38  22:12  22:45

GOTTTAAA DO TOJIII NEXXTTT
Personally I watched every avatar yallshould have watched everything by now too
Sokka: A Journey Into Rizz City Think about it.
Azula was gonna execute that servant. But she showed mercy.
for the little time he was shown i feel like a video should be made on toji from JJK not for insanity but for like BAF or somthin
I loved watching this. I hope you're planning to do more of these on other insane characters in fiction, because I'd watch all of them. Instant subscribe.
Ik u made an omnimam vid but omniman a journey to insanity should work
I can fix her
Bill Cipher zaddy

Mr, Dachamp I humbly request Mash's entry Into the roundtable of Air Force energy
i just finished watching redo of healer from ep 1 ep 12. I must say you were right, that is some god damn HENT@III !!!!!!!
He really should make a vid about  zaheer. Bro legitimately packed up the entirety of team avatar INCLUDING THE WHITE LOTUS and gave korra IMMENSE ptsd
This was a dope start to the series. She probably doesn't qualify but Jinx from Arcane would be perfect for this new series.
my regards to the captain
We NEED VEGATA VID NEOWWWWWW
We NEED VEGATA VID NEOWWWWWW
Bro you should do that villain from Kung fu panda 2 that white tiger one who radiates black force air force energy

I can fix her
Ozai is a menace for damn sure. He got Black Force Activity
THIS IS GONNA BE A BANGER ASS SERIES
Will we see Cid get a place on the round table after Season 2 of Eminence in Shadow is out?
I want to see a video on cid kageno

Tokyo revenger s2 when?
Stinkmeaner from the boondocks shouldn't been patient 1 just my opinion
Is it just me or this man's edits keep getting better with every upload. I legit lost it at 15:08
You should do a video on Blue Eye Samurai (Mizu) She has the coldest Blue Black Air Force Energy
Seeing this just makes me NEED down in my LOINS a vid on Mizu from blue eye samurai
Toji when?
OnG we need iroh on the round table. just bc bro doesnt go out of his way to be a menace don't mean he aint a menace
I'd change her....
Nah let's keep it above nobody be talking about one of the black Air forces Star wars OG general grievous I'm telling you this man was crazy he had the OP scared he was killing them left and right he even had the council worried

I have watched cj for at least a year, and I somehow haven't subscribed yet.  Time to fix that
Are u ever gonna add guts to the round table
we gotta have light yagami on this shii
Just for the records Aang is stronger than Azula. He don’t need the avatar state to beat her . She’s girl so he wouldn’t see the the need to fight her seriously. That was a sneak attacked Azula did as well.
I think the boy Toji should be at the table now he stay in the black forces💯
Ay CJ put Toji on that roundtable
Danganronpa that girl is a psycho crazy girl she needs to be double O2
I know it's too late, but hear me out: how about including the nfs most wanted M3 gtr in the round table? Or, since it's a car, in the garage? I mean, omniman isn't an Anime character, but got included, why not a car? That vehicle been a menace in Rockport city, man.   But since the asylum series has level 5 max insanity, why not include it in an impound garage? If I remember, there's also a max heat level of 5 in the game
I can fix her!
HEY CJ WHERE'S THE VIDEO ON THE REVERSE FLASH THE BIGGEST HATER IN THE TOON VERSE
Where's that Vector shine from Yugioh Zexal??!!? That dude should have been put down for what he did to my boy Yuma😢😢😢
Your channels on fyah bruv     no pun intended
DO DRAKEN
she maybe crazy but she a BADDIE
You should do a beserk vid
Hated Azula as a kid.  And I STILL hate her punk ass to this day
i'd like to remind people of the classic saying: All girls are bi, you just gotta figure out if it's sexual or polar.
Yo cj, PLEASE DO RIMURU TEMPEST HE HAS CRAZY BLACK AIR FORCE ENERGY!!!!!!!!!
So no more most disrespectful moments in anime or the hood safary?
the deepfaked clips makes the video way better
Do Luna from boondocks next
hidan has to be in the asylum
14:23 AYO WHY DOES AANG LOOK LIKE THAT

Great start for this new series can't wait to see who's next
His crazy Azula impression sound like Stinkmeaner
brother you gotta do ainz from overlord next time
7:44 not sure why but I just lost it laughing!

You should do a Millions Knives video next for both Trigun '98 and Stampede, Nai definitely needs to be in The Asylum.
5:15 even when she crazy she taking none of that zodiac sign bullshit 💀
16:12 GYATTTTTT
Azula when it comes to rizz is just like me
That Haikyu joke was so fucking true that’s shit killed me 😂😂
Hey CJ for the next asylum video you should do Envy form FMA brotherhood. That thing is the craziest MF I’ve ever seen in an anime besides this chick.
Hittin that Itachi pose knowing damn well she’d kill her whole family without even being told 😂😂
What music was playing during the Agni Kai portion of the video?
a Azula Actually killed Aang
Do Jason from Tokyo Ghoul bro is a serious nut case
This was much needed for me. I'm in the army right now and watching this video really did it for me. Thanks CG.
Bro put yuno gasai in this bitch
w cj
You should put Rick Sanchez in the black air force activity
Would give Azula crazy back💥💥💥💥
Yuno Gasai needs an episode of this
I forgot Avater as a series even existed 😂😂😂😂☝☝
Clean bro, clean ! U cookin'n shit !
We need another Tokyo revengers Black air force energy video cuz the new season is fire
I kinda wish the creators would've done a sort of remake, but with Invincible levels of gore. Azula probably would've been 10x the menace
Ik damn well bros gon make a toji vid soon
You should make a round table for the character that have the best rizz
I can save her 😂😂😂
Bruh I can’t breathe 😂😂
Bro 19:51  really says bitch what did you says to me???😂😂😂😂

Bro erbody doing this now
I'd love to see the kishin from soul eater in this series
This my first time watchin you and I had to sub less than a min in😭. Love the energy, keep it up.
Fire Nation city girl is wild
The terrifying thing about Azula is that she gets even more unhinged in the comics.   (SPOILER ALERT)  So some years after the main story, whileAzula was in solitary confinement, Zuko discovers that his mom had gone to get some orange juice, and ended up... getting "juiced". She got a new man and Zuko might have gotten a sibling if he showed up at her door a year later.   Naturally, he's over the moon, but he makes the mistake of telling Azula thinking the good news might fix her a little... forgetting she has daddy AND mommy issues, so he ends up in a race against time to stop her from deleting their mother
13:53, is she Crip walking
12:37, where's that from
17:40 I’m Dead😂😂😂😂😂😂
EDIT: I have seen enough of New Challenger to say:  *_GET BRYAN HAWK IN THAT ASYLUM_*
Hope they review jinx from arcane for the asylum
That pound town scene was crazy ngl😂
Attack on Titan final episode video when?

You should add Shadow to the Saint asylum or put them in the black force energy the show is call  the eminence and shadow
We definitely getting a juri episode right? From the street fighter series
Can you do Savitar from flash
W monetization
do toji
Azula would’ve loved Jada Smith
No cap my nigga do venom
Nomination for Patient 002 in the Asylum: Light Yagami
The asylum should be for people who have way too much Black air force energy but don't know how to manage it. Like azula.
Can we appreciate how nicely he replicated real life bih activity
Aye bro when is toji gonna join the round table?
What mf would have the name 'Coochie_Burglar445'
7:00 - 7:06 Nigga I was vibing with Azula's gang
Here we go a new series, THE ASYLUM! WHO ELSE WILL MAKE THE PSYCHO CUT, AND WHY HAVEN'T SOME OF THE ROUND TABLE MEMBERS BEEB PSYCH EVALUATED AND SENT THERE😂
If you're doing an insanity meter, you should definitely include Bondrewd from Made in abyss at some point, the things this man has done is some of the most insane shit in anime, that weird ass dad from FMAB doesn't even compare in my opinion
i can fix her
Make a video about puffy gear 5😊😊😮🎉🎉🎉❤❤
I would like to submit, Toji Zenin to the Black Air Force league
I can still fix her.

I forgot how much of a MENACE Azula was. If she wasn't so crazy she'd have to be on the roundtable
"I can fix her!"  - Me, Circa '08
You should make a video on Toji Fushiguro cuz that man is an absolute beast 🔥
bro in the comics she was so fukin cinvinced her momma would do something to her that she managed to finder her minutes before team aang, but when they got there they saw the unbelievable shock on Azula when her own mother didnt even know who she is, and was so in denial that she thought her mom was acting but legit their mother had her mind wiped of her 1st family
Did anyone notice the cod3 zombies outro
I have some patient recommendations for the future if you decide to continue this series: -Batman -Shinji -Thorfinn -Eren Yeager -Baki (and his many schizo moments from the Father/Son fight arc)
Anylisis request: bill cipher he may not be from an anime but he's one crazy nigga.(gravity falls on Disney +)
I'm just gonna say toji better be on the black Air Force court ngl
Can you do Hajime nagumo please

Hey can u do the most broken Rival, that ash Ketchum has had Alain
Tekken 8 ost nice pick as always 😎
I would love to see a black Air Force energy on vegeta if there’s not one already
I think Firelord Ozai need to join his daughter
Just a reminder Iroh: whole army, about 2 years, probably hundreds if not thousands of casualties, and he just broke through one wall before giving up Azula brought her two besties and took the whole city in less than a month with only one or two casualties on the enemy side  girl might have been crazy, but she was effective
I remember being a teen and thinking non stop how hot was the entire Azula team but especially Azula... Am a grow ass man now and I blame the entire team Azula for my taste in women. Their entire uniform it's a literal red flag yet I folded like a damn kid.
Bondrewd from made in abyss would be an excellent character to cover in this new series your starting!
I have the Epidemie of Reversal, what if we flip the script around and have her go to the same psychological breakdown & identity crisis that Zuko went through except with her own instability it's even worse; Work overtime, her drive was Dissipating and searched losing her fire at a slower rate.  And thanks to ask I help Mai and Tai Lee genuinely help her with this well Azula is such being more open and questions everything.  Even Iroh takes pity on his niece and hes a mock prisoner being an unofficial counselor to her and his student will also trained by the dragon; Starting zuko alone early. Even though the original Is incomplete this three parts should reveal enough: p1 https://youtu.be/BFOeAjRbGyM?si=mWw5TDOa-1oSWBhx P2 https://youtu.be/lW_IlNZV0rQ?si=LmN6I1Q03tbadPkZ P3 https://youtu.be/Kjhn4zwOMFw?si=rgwXsVwJ36GWRowo
My guys we NEED CJ to  add Toji from JJK to the round table NNOWWWWW💀💀💀💀💀
I wont lie CJ gotta enter Toji into the round table. He had them black ones on acting like a menace for minute
21:52 I just realized he kinda sounds like the cyborg guy 💀
Can you please do Tokyo revengers season 2
I can fix her
Is she insane,azula why you trying to kill you bestie. May the Lord have mercy on her soul
I can't wait to see the joker here
Azula: my own mother thought i was a monster, she was right of course but it still hurt.
In the books that they made after the main series she was even crazier if remember right.
Be careful CJ. once Yoshikage saw the beginning of this video, Killer Queen put a bomb on your PC and Keyboard.  And even though Azulas ol' trifling ass is insane, she got WHOOPED along side Firelord Ozai
Toji next Black air force  🔥
I already see this series leading up to a joker episode and I'm for it
I like her
where the toji vid at
Nah you have to put Toji from JJK in the round table, boy is a menace
Better do a video on Toji soon
CJ if you can do a video about Acnologia from fairy tail pls🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Azula's 😢
Does anyone know the sound effect on 1:57
Omg you actually made this one 😂 Im gonna be enjoying it!
She tried to pull a man, at least give her props for that 😂
Mfs be like “I can fix her” (I’m mfs)
Do toji from jujutsu kaisen
Azula still single? Because... I'd hit
Hey cj a a place in the asylum called the menaces or the room
💥
Toji should be in the black airforce
Nahhh cuz you guy think what cj said was bad but to make everything he said two times worse. This little girl is 14
The funny thing about it is the girl gets even crazier in the comics because honestly she escaped prison and starts a f****** cult.... and I'm dead serious read the comics she gets even crazier!!!
Nah Azula committed Taboo shooting on Aangs back like that
Azula doesn't need a menace video cause this is her menace to society video
We nned to get enough likes on this so cj will do a season three synopsis for tokyo revengers fam. Please.😅
You got to do another video on avatar the last air bender on kama the very first blood bender that bitch gave me nightmares for weeks
Do gojo next
Looking forward to see this new series
I like how cj acts like a girl with the popular girl voice
The saddest thing about this is that Azula was only 14 years old. Sometimes you forget, because she was constantly on her demon time and dressed like a soldier, but Azula was quite literally just a child trying to do what she thought would make her father most proud of her. Zuko was the exact same at the start of the series. Everything he did was to make Ozai love him again; the only real difference between them is that Zuko had a goated caretaker like Iroh to guide him and teach him to hold onto his humanity. Azula had nothing in her life but a lukewarm father and a bunch of yes men who feared her. I like to imagine that if she'd had someone who genuinely loved her enough to hold her accountable and support her from the very beginning, she might've turned out able to turn her life around just like Zuko did.
Azusa the reason I like crazy hoes
You gotta do the Shredder from the 2012 TMNT, that man is so petty that he'd rather have the world to be destroyed just to settle a grudge against Splinter, not to mention he also stole his daughter, mutated her, and he still has the balls to blame it on Splinter
Do Nichole waterson pls. She belongs to the asylum.
OMG DO YUNO GASAI
Does anyone know what song he used when talked about the drill
I like the asylum series
Toji needs to be here
They got that fuegoleon and meroleana relationship just more toxic
Ever done classroom of the elite ayanokoji vs ryuen? Ayanaokji 1v4 ryuens whole team the proceeds to beat Ryuen down with no emotion till he feels fear which Ryuen said he's never felt before
I’m ngl y’all…I could fix her
The call of duty sounds and music was great
Where is ur discord server
That is off a PUURKKUH
Now this is the series where you add griffith put him in the deepest and darkest cell you got
Doesnt post often but when he does its a banger
“Entertain me bitch” 😂
All I gotta say is azula is basically avatars Katherine Pierce while zuko is avatar's Damon
you gotta do lord shen from Kung Fu Panda 2
Her rizz is on par with the dinosaurs... Dead
Dem spits bruh!!!😍😍😍
Am I the only one who wanted to clap her cakes?? Yes?? Aight... Fa sho 💀
Homestly i think at least for now the only reason ozai didn’t have a video on him is that he barely fully appears for most of the show we had to wait to season 3 to see his face but man with the few you had damn azula a monster but ozai a god sin of a trash human being
I'd like to nominate every single arch bishop of the witch cult in Re: Zero. They can't be allowed to get away with such madness. I'd rather live with Azula then even cross paths with an arch bishop
I like Mai, she was ready to fight Azula . I would do the same shit!
another video heck ya boi
make a video on raian
Yeah... Id rather deal with makima from chainsawman
Vampire hunter d last blood 🔥🔥🔥
Really looking forward to the Higurashi episode
why she hot tho?
So would Cartman be here or at the roundtable?
Bioshock asylum
Do u think is a yuno gasai is a suitable recommendation for the asylum
Yo do fyodor dostoevsky from bungou stray dogs
I like the new format. the asylum for crazies is awesome. can't wait for the next one
After seeing the preview, I thought it would be just a psychological analysis of Azula, but I didn't think it would be SUCH a masterpiece Editing, sound effects, narration, jokes, I almost died of laughter
"I can fix her"
I've waited for so long!!!
Cant wait to see all the channels that rip you off start doing this now lol
Love it can't wait for the next Psycho
A Petition for Toji Fushiguro to be reviewed for induction into the board of Blackforces.
i wanna see one for ninjago lord garmadon
Idk about y’all but I think it should say INsanity meter just saying 1:15
Azula shows us all the Meance in the Madness.
yo the shadows of evil outro was a beautiful touch chefs kiss 😘
Those were hella funny
Yo can you should really do the Tokyo revengers black Air Force the anime again
Just wait until he do redo the healer☠️
Do princess bubblegum
Orochimaru plz make one about him
Orochimaru plz make one about him
Orochimaru plz make one about him
Once azula started losing control of the plot. She completely lost it
Azula is just built  different and dont forget that she was only 14 years of age and was able to perfect lightening bending and took over an entire kingdom she is not someone to play with.
THIS IS SOME TOP TIER COMEDY AM LITERALLY CRYING 🤣🤣🤣🤣
More jojo
YUP LETS GOOO WE GOT THIS SERIES NOW WE FINNA GET AN ESDEATH AND KIRA ONE FRRRR 🔥❤️
do Yuno from future diary
Please do Jinx from Arcane next
Damn strong start for No001 Is this the Roundtable Asylum?
Obito needs a seat at the round table
You make my whole month
PLEASE reverse flash next time is CRAZYYYY and the biggest menace
WHILE AZULA WAS CRAZY I DO REMEMBER IROH SAYING THAT IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE LIGHTNING YOU HAVE TO IT THE RIGHT WAY OR IT WILL MESS YOUR BRAIN AND SPIRIT. AZULA SHOWS THIS TO BE TRUE AFTER SHE MASTERED LIGHTNING BUT IN THE WRONG WAY.
Fire nation's city girlz
16:40 You know it's bad when CJ turns on the face cam
Can you make a playlist with the music you use for the backgrounds of these videos, the version of loonboon you used goes hard.
LOVEEEEEEEEEE THIS NEW SERIE
if she never had fire in her and had no skill  I WOULD BE THE SHI OUT OF HER ON TOP
Azula is THE bad bitch of my childhood I swear. An absolute demon in the best way. Hurts a bit as an adult to realize she's like 14 and already so cracked in the cranium.  THE POLAR EXPRESS BIT JESUS FUCK
the amount of times sonic has been brought up at the funniest moments   good job keep up the good work
CJ when are we going to get that Doflamingo video?
Tbf it wasn’t even her fault she was equally as abused as, if not more than zuko just because she was a prodigy of bending and was more useful to Ozai that was the only type of “love” she has ever felt fear. So she made everyone else fear her as a way to have people near her. She’s only 14 in avatar that is insane
Azula is a hating ass mf she was clownin her brother and was on demon time she wanted to smoke that Z pack
And the craziest thing is she was 12 during this
Do major next from hu he is tottaly inasne including his war speech
Bro azulas pack music got me dead 😭😭
I can fix her
okok I just want more CJ so Im all for a new series
Ong cj need to do that crazy girl from I think the immortal king sum he did a video of it B4 dead ass forgot the anime name but dude is immortal and he can transform into anyone he meet after they die was a good ass anime fr fr but I'd like to see how insane he rate her even tho in my opinion she a automatic 5
On god im waiting to see kira' episode
Nahhhhh bro, I guess you might have gotten copyrighted so that's why you didn't do it but for the part where she's talking to the captain you should have just let that shit play out. No one can compare to the Mastery of what she says to that man
Cj creating a whole new series:  Meanwhile niggas waiting for more round table episodes:
Hayase should be on this list from To Your Eternity/Fumetsu No Anata E
Ahhhhhhhh  welcome to the asylum 1:18
I like this. Good to contrast the str8 evil rizz of black air force energy with the batshit insane rizz.
Nah that comic boi that bar be overloaded
Bro i forget half of this 💩 happened fr 😂😂😂
Straight fire
I got a addition to the black airforce table, Toji Fushiguru
You got yourself a new subscriber 😂
azula's rizz was so bad i actually clicked away from the video for a bit from cringe. im so sorry! 😭
DaChamp has returned.
I can fix her
We need ame Baki,'s mom
Azula attended the Eren School Of Hitting Characters Mid Transformation.
My favorite part was when Aang said "Damn, this Bitch is crazy, my only hope is the ancient Technique of Co-
nice series, nagatio from danganronpa would be a good fit.
"Ay, where the lightning at, hoe?" lmao please
Motherless behavior detected
This is peak brother, can't wait to see what kind of crazy ass mofos show up
CJ u gottta do a video on Gojo or Shigaraki bro
I can fix her
Do aizen
Na fuck that CJ where tf you been, we need 1 from ya every 3wks gang 😂💯
Damn
Light Yagami needs to go into the asylum next
Why'd you turn Ozai into Uncle Ruckus? XD I mean, i guess it fits XD
You know if Ozai had taken Azula with him he probably would've won.
Why isn't Eren at the round table ?
Yo CJ the next video you should make video called Lu-Bu
1:39 Ruckus check
Naw bro she killed Aang Katara had to use that special water to bring him back 😂😂
Nah nah thats that anime mom look shes making. thats my mom after work 20:04
7:45 nah they imported an sonic unleashed (the best sonic game) stage in the show i already love this
Can't wait for a hisoka video 😂
Ha
Hey have you seen Ajin? We need Sato on the roundtable.
You should put griffith in here
I wanna see you cover Blue Lock characters
I CAN SAVE HER
Here before a Mill
alright CJ you know what this means right? Now you gotta do a joker vid and make him apart of the asylum roster, cause that dude is a fiend
I know of Three characters in all of fiction who deserve to be put in The Asylum. The Master (Doctor Who), Cinder Fall (RWBY) And Mr. Black A.K.A The Berserker Predator (Predators)
Cj reverse flash when ?
The best cartoon to ever touch my screen.Avater is just a classic🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
bth azula looks better without the lipstick
Like this change with adding the Asylum, keeping it fresh!!!
#001 Azula Perfect!!!!!
We have got to make an exception for kamen rider genm from kamen rider ex aid. That man literally has a god complex
Light gotta be in this series
Out of curiosity CJ, is it possible for someone to both be a patient of The Asylum and a member of the Black Forces? I can see several candidates for such a classification, one of which was even shown as an example of an Asylum Patient (Junko Enoshima).
Amazing new series and video I hope one day you can put myne from shield hero in here because that bitch gotta go. If people have seen season 3 you know why.
Aang is sleep deprived and Azula talking bout "you can laugh, its funny" 😂😂😂
Hi I am fan from soooooooooooooooo long
I can fix her
Shes a complete psycho but shes a baddie. I wouldnt in fear of death but i know some would
New SERIES OML bro seein what he needs next
"You could puncture the hull of the battleship leaving thousands to drown at sea.. cuz it's so sharp.." Azula really be like me for real 😭  "Saving my mans, a feeling you will never know" YOU ROASTED AZULA WITH FLAMES HOTTER THAN HER BLUE FIRE ON THAT ONE 🔥
Funny part is that she actually calls him Zuzu 💀
I am one again telling you to watch Durarara to experience INSANE Black Air Force Energy
Asura from soul eater
Dabi needs to be locked up
Some people thinking Katara beating azula is disrespectful to zuko. But my opinion, zuko did beat Azula, in terms of loyalty, and who was truly fit to rule.
Fire Nation City Girls is crazy😂😂😂😂
Itsssss highhhh noooooon
Cj Dachamp makes another return witj a new banger series, and I gonna say picking Azula for this was perfect, and it shows her is just the cariest yet most deep in my opinion    Hope yall had a great day
Fun fact 4:40-4:46 that is among the sounds a T.rex would make! No joke, there are videos on YouTube that detail the discovery of sounds that T.rex made. This is a good breakdown on Azula and her character in the show. It's good she is getting redeemed as well. Redemption is a blessing and available for everyone no matter how evil the actions committed. I've been redeemed from my college senate days and it has been remarkable in life since. Redemption is both a quick and long process. The effects last longterm and the event itself is sudden and powerful.
eh CJ WTF IS GOING ON???
you never   done  doflamingo he is a MENACE
She could get the work js
So is this going to be a continuous series next to the round table or only once a year thing for Halloween
You wouldn't be aware of this if you haven't read the tie-in comics, but Azula actually made a full recovery. In fact, after she got the chance to speak with her mother, she actually ended up in a better place mentally than she was when she was first introduced in the show. The final tie-in comic had her secretly forming an organization to *safeguard* Zuko's reign.
now we got the baf round table and the now those who are too insane to even try qualify for the round table, noice
The audio of soda in the bg be killing me😂😂
That psycho b tho 🥴
Can u do johan libert  Anime name:monster.
I know this is a new series, but azula defined belongs in the round table
Love this new concept
Bro it's been a 2 years
Thank you
That one friend that always be like: "I can fix her bro" ends up getting Banished.
where did the intro go?
Bros gotta do carnage from Spider-Man the Animated Series. 😂
The hair band thing is a reference to Japan's Shoguns. They would grow their hair out long and then do it up in a pony tail. If they were dishonored, they'd cut the ponytail off, and have to get it back in blood. (that last part might be wrong, but I'm setting the scene)  Zuko still had his hairband because even in exile, he was still the Crown Prince, so he still had that clout. Iroh was a respected veteran, and so he kept his on... Eventually, when Zuko and Iroh get jumped because the fecking captain of that boat spoke the quiet part aloud, they cut their hair in disgrace. And for the rest of the series, they're doing one of three things: Laying low, fighting Aang, or trying to get it back in blood against Azula or the Fire Lord
As the asylums head lunch warden each patient gets 1 pick for their dinner azula picked ...uhh...(how do i say this?...oh ok) she picked cherry pie the thing why i struggeld is bc she drew zukos face on it and crushed it
Bro needs to do shadow from emniece in shadow

Cant lie, since i was like 5 ive thought Azula was bad af

The muscle man impression was too accurate 😭

Yo CJ get mr Takamora a spot on that round table bro is mike tysons dad
Do a vid with Toji fushiguro

Azula was not only crazy, but selfish as well. We can learn from this character that being selfish never leads up to something good, just like the war and environmental impacts that are happening right now.
As someone who grew up on Avatar, i was pleased at the sight if this video
AY AYO CJ YOU BETTER ADD YOUR ASS SUKUNA

The most original YouTuber i know
Aww hell nah theres a avatar manga?!?! Nigga this is anime atp🤣🤣
Can't wait for the Reverse Flash video
Shawty was tweaking at the end of the Agni Kai 😅
As crazy as she is, part of her decent to insanity was just that, a decent. It’s not her fault she was born with a few screws loose, but because she never got the kind of help she needed growing up, being raised by the worst father alive in her world, it’s clear to see from an outside perspective how she was doomed to fail from the start.   That doesn’t make what she’s done any less evil, it just means she never had the opportunity to become something better than she was.  Essentially, she a crazy ass bitch, shame she turned out that way, now lock her the fuck up before she fucks the shit up.
Fatherless psycho princess off a perk hit me dying 😂
I got one: Chris McClean.
Nah you gotta make a series about dead-beat dads💀
it was Ozai's fault that Azula was fucking batshit crazy
You should do another Tokyo revengers at the round table bc the other characters in that anime have black air forces
This is amazing
I’ve been waiting for this for a long time🌞
Pls do a 'berserk' anime video, I mean he's already in the round table but has no video
When you said "all this sh*t spewed everywhere" I heard someone rip an atomic fart, and I checked and found out it wasn't from the vid💀💀
Azula's so crazy CJ had to make an asylum for her
Ok CJ why have you not made a vid on grifith yet free content for your 2 month upload schedule
You should do this with orochimaru, obito, and isoka from hunter x hunter
No rizz had me dead
Chef DaChamp was cooking and he even made a new series yessir next i hope we get Johan Liebert from Monster as a nice change of pace   What do yall think?
I, an enthusiastic video essay enjoyer, expecting some deep thoughts masterpiece from the title, and getting this masterpiece instead was quite the refresher 🤣. I love this with all my being
Oh yeah I’m ready for the mentally insane characters that belong in the asylum let’s go CJ!
The Asylum? Oh yeah, Lad Russo deserves a spot in this series!
Despite her being evil, Azula is fine asl without make up 15:06
I recently came up with an alternate dynamic between Azula and Aang:  She still falls at the air temple, right when Zuko says, “She’s not gonna make it.” Aang takes notice and in a moment of impulse, Aang jumps down, glides toward her, catches her, and lands her safely on the ground, saving her life, he then quickly flies back to Appa and they take off a split second after. This would no doubt ship away another piece of her false reality. Imagine the shame and humiliation she'd feel after that. She most likely wouldn't even be able to lightningbend anymore and Zuko got his chest scar from a regular boring blue fireball. As she’s randomly banishing people, she’ll probably give the same ultimatum as Ozai; capture the avatar, and their honor shall be restored.  Due to Azula being a descendant of Aang's past life Roku. (and/or due to Ozai being Vaatu in disguise in the case of my take on a dark avatar Ozai) Aang and Azula become spiritually, connected, linked, and bonded with each other. This bond was created after Aang had let go of Katara and embraced his last chakra twice. It goes deeper than physical connections. This bond unites them as fate, allowing them to understand each other, share each other's experiences, derive character development from each other, and grow closer to each other than anyone else despite being on opposite sides of the war. Aang would even be able to know when Azula lies better than Toph can and vice versa. This connection grows stronger over time. It reaches its apex after Azula has opened and mastered her own chakras.
Oh man I would’ve never of guessed CJ would make a new series about the paychopaths of cartoon and anime
Honestly if you gonna keep this series going, then you might as well take a look on the most dangerous anime yandere, I suggest gasei yuno from future dairy
I'll be waiting on the edge of my seat for when Mayuri Kurotsuchi from Bleach gets added to the Asylum because that man is absolutely cracked
Hate the character not the actress  She is comic gold.
Hisoka is next bruh
love the asylum series tho
Azula is the reason for my toxic women addiction
14:24  putting ang on ti-lee’s body my guy u are insane😂😂😂
I COULD FIX HER BUT I DONT WANT TO
I apologize for my ouytburst 😭😭😭 head ass long feng
Did I miss the theme song?
Why bro sound like ruckus 😭😭😭😭🐐
The Black Air Force Asylum. Looking forward to Yuno Gasai’s file lol.
Smash. Next question.
This is a good segment, there are so many unhinged characters to chose from
I was hoping to get the baki vs yujiro fight here
Gojo video plsss
DAMN FROM THE TABLE TO THE ASYLUM OH HELL NAW I JUST HAD A NIGHTMARE 😢
Azula the Asylumlord
LOVED THIS ALOT😂😂😂
You gotta do the serial killer ass airbender from legend of Korra
10/10 Vid😭😭
Man I forgot she smiled deviously when Zuko got burned by his dad.  Her and Zhao( who got that ass handed by Zuko thankfully)
DO HISOKA NEXT HE NEEDS TO BE IN HERE
Unpopular opinion: Avatar is an anime. It's Western anime. We have to stop being gatekeepers on stuff that even the Japanese would call anime, lol
You know it's about to be good when CJ drops heat💀💀💀
I'm looking forward to kira and pls don't forget dead mans Questions if ur doing it
Hoping to see Johan in one of these
I just love how you basically implied that one of the reasons for Azula madness could be sexual frustration lol girl can't get no D !! (I mean, she's 14 AKA a legit teenager, so, no doubts that those raging hormones aren't helping her mindset out and now that I wrote it down, I realise that without her mother around, I also doubt that Ozai would spare a minute to give her the Talk... not that I think he would be qualified for it in the first place lol)
kenpachi from Bleach, Please, PLEASE, MY MAN.
I lovin this new series 😂
Bro the SKKKEEEEEEEEEEEE
Cj you gotta do kakegurui 💀 💀 for this new series
The Muscle man impression is on the spot.
She belong to the streets
I have no idea what the anime is called but that one that's been circulating recently where he says "i am atomic" could make a good video yall 👀
Poor Azula, zuko does later take her on a quest to find their mom and she disappears. I hope she finds happiness I always felt bad for her.
The joker and then Batman next because he needs to be locked up too with his crazy ass lol
does uncle iroh have a seat in the round table tho?
Is there different rooms depending on how insane they are?
SMASH
Azula is an example of a product of nature+nurture . Azula was born psychopathic but because she was raised by Ozai and around war from the time she was born, she was made worse. She probably could have been just a mean/weird girl if she had been raised by anyone else. Unlike Azula, young Zuko had a moral compass. Azula liked hurting things and people. Sure her mother should have cared for her but she already had Ozai Ptsd
Keep it up C.J. You’re my favorite content creator on YouTube. Keep going!💯💪🏼
Hey Cj if Azula is in the Asylum can we put Iroh in the round table pls. If not that can we see who from the round table deserves to be in the Asylum also?
Making me wanna rewatch this
Could Azula get a spot on the Roundtable?
15:10
Can we get a balalaika video from black lagoon
I really want to see Jinx on this series 😏🤌
Been waiting for you drop a video 😮🔥👌💯👏🤔🤗
Lol yayyy u did a video 📹 on our childhood anime Nickelodeon show😂🎉😅
Been asking for a black beetle (young justice) menace video.
Day two of asking for cid kagenou from eminence in shadow
Ty Lee was my first childhood crush compared to emo and crazy her gentle and bubbly personality was such a refresh everytime she's on screen
Bro THANK UUUU ithought i was the only nigg a think about how dumb that play from katara was
AND ALSO ASURA FROM SOUL EATER
The editing is so fucking good 😂
CJ DACHAMP BRO I JUST GOT YOU OTHER PATIENTS, BRO MEDUSA FROM SOUL EATER AND CRONA, YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM IN THEIR
And she was 14 during all this. Damn, she better have a redemption arc soon or she may become worse as time goes on.  Also, with this new thing... will the likes of Light or Johan be on the roundtable or set straight into the deepest parts of the asylum?
Ngl I kinda like em crazy. Azula can get it anytime frfr
Now I have a reason to watch this show thanks Cj Dachamp
I love this new segment this has plenty potential
I enjoy Cj's commentary more than the animationsl/animes he covers themselves. This commentary just keeps getting better and better each upload. I was sad it's been awhile since the last video but I can tell he put a lot of effort into this one, it had me rolling
21:22 still would hit
Can’t wait for that one guy from that anime you show when someone says anime is for kids
The Asylum Is Your Peak Works. I adore this beyond eating food
Great work. You want another inmate, how about Medusa from soul eater. Witch was a hater to the end
Glad you switching things up for the copycat . You have like 10 people copying cj
do you accept joker? joker gotta be a ambassador of being a craziest mother fucka
When you realize Azula could have simply ruled the earth Kingdom
Hisoka should be the next patient for this series and also this serious is alr so good keep up the good work man
This is HILARIOUS!! 🤣🤣😭👌🏽
24:02 but what if one day you leave ?
Junko from Danganronpa series and the games deserve to be in the round table of black air force activity or insanity
Do a cyberpunk universe episode!
Yoshikage Kira?
Ngl drilling the Great Wall of china sounds like a garden warfare map
Tweakin hardcore💀💀
She insane as shit, buuutt! Round table of black air force energy material here
15:11 You just made me remember the show did THIS 😂😂
add home lander in there
Cj Dachamp i have someone for the round table his name is merume
This feels like a hole  new season to a game show
Ngl she deserves better I could fix her trust me
I don't know what's crazier, Azula's whole arc or Lenarr's 'I gotta take a doo doo' track in this video. 😂
0:58 YEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSS! Please tell me you’re gonna cover him soon! That mf NEEDS to be locked tf up right now!
I can fix her
Yes yes we all hated the horse tail!😂😂😂 But it kind of makes sense. Since his father burned half his face it is reasonable to assume a lot of his hair burned as well. Particularly along the side of his head. He probably cut it like that to even it out, and because he is a prince none of his crew had the b@plz to tell him after he was done healing that the ponytail had to go🤣😂😅
The shadows music at the end is perfect
awesome
Need to see Junko in the next episode bro
I wanted her to have her redemption arc in the show and stuff. They even confirmed it!
22:44 🤣
Azul means blue, i forgot what language tho
I can change her
PLEASE DO GOJO VS HANAMI, ITS THE KSOT DISRESPECTFUL FIGHT IN HISTORY
cj why was you playing that game because of it we had to wait another 5 days bro
Make more videos
Add homelander
Doflamingo definitely needs to be the next patient💯💯
Bro needs to do one for kira from jojos bizarre adventure
The Asylum? Literally every villain in RWBY fits this series. From killing to commiting war crimes to actual genocide and scaring people for life I nominate Tyrian, Salem and Cinder with Adam as a honorable mention. That boy Adam wanted to wipe out humanity because half his face was branded with a company logo. Dog literally killed his own people for not following. Boy even helped wipe out a entire kingdom, mutilated one of the main characters, nearly killed another and was abusive on top of that and he's just the honorable mention on my list.  CJ I nominate RWBY villains for this list.
I low key hate the excuse for azula being crazy and mentally unstable for why she was losing to zuko,  While at the same time we see how deluded and crazy zuko has been the whole series yet no excuses. 🤦🏽‍♂️
This Knigge is literally playing jump rope with a dragon
Do something about one piece or do luffy gear five because I have you seen how crazy that Knigge is
Did azula kill her grandfather or was it her dad that did it?
Do kuvira next for the legend of korra
lmao
2:42 is just crazy and I just started watching
Bro my cousins nickname is Tom-Tom 💀
24:08   Crazy    Hahaha
ight but hear me out…
14:02 reminds me that had Azula and Zuko been on good terms from the start, they prolly could’ve and would’ve defeated and/or killed Aang
shit if the joker will be in one of those episodes the meter gonna blow to the moon there's no enough levels for his insanity
CJ Dachamp really has the most immaculate music taste and selections, i did not expect to hear the bo3 zombies round end music So damn good 👏😭
Like if I'm right
Bro post on your second channel
Why is this so accurate AND hilarious ?😂
I dont care she crazy. I can fix her
I loved watching the avatar series , the nastalgia I'm frlling rn
Also can you do either, Peter Griffin, Stewie Griffin, or Glenn Quagmire from Family Guy
In the comics Zuko and gang find his mother and Azula hears this so she breaks out and I think kills her own mother and then she gets locked up again
In the words of her beloved uncle: “Nah, she is crazy and she needs to go down.”  Well, Azula went down and it was not pretty.  Still one of my favorite characters of the show. And this is from someone who used to not like her back then.
Azula before yami
This was dope keep it going!!!
Great we have the definition of bat shit crazy on our hand
I would love if he did a recap of all of avatar the last airbender the way he does these videos
I want to see him do ozai
Azula may have the power of fire, but I have the power of G U N and the suitcase full of meth I snorted. Since I live in the glorious United States of America. And for those who are gonna comment but this isn’t in America. Everywhere is America,they just don’t realize it.
CJJJ do a jjk one please monkey
Lol that’s hilarious  And yes azula might be the most insane character in atla Or even lok. Shoting her uncle? What is wrong with her Feeling betrayed? She knows he is better than her?
Ayo CJ mahn please put Griffith on stand
New series bby lesgooooo 🔈🔈🔈
Asylum could have some great members. I would nominate the Joker (no shit right?) as a member everyone knows, and Gates from Full Metal Panic as a lesser known member. Gates was pretty crazy in every scene he was in. And the disrespect he showed the twins is only eclipsed by the disrespect Griffin showed Guts.
Nah this new series is fire, keep up the fire content 🔥🔥🔥
Nah, you can send the psyco bitches to me I got a plan...
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
7:03 7:05 amazing 😂
NOONE CAN DO IT LIKE CJ 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥💯💯🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🔥💯🔥🗣️🗣️
Please sir, upload on your second channel.....PLEASE!!!!!
16:53 lmao
Please tell me ur gonna cover Junko and not just use her as the face of “Crazy Bitch” cuz that’s just too disrespectful
Man, I can't wait until you tackle Satoko Hojo and Junko Enoshima's cases in the Asylum. Both of those psychotic bitches could give a Joker a run for his goddamn money.
Hey please add the eminence shadow to the aylum
Im all in for this
This vid was a long time coming. #OVERDUE but excellent work as always! I hope they make a sequel.
He is da champ And yeah she's an effin psychopath
So she's crazy 'cause... daddy issues?😂
I never heard of the I gotta take a doodoo song until now, and thats my fav part of this whole video LMAO
I say Medusa or Crona from Soul Eater deserve a spot is The Asylum. Anyone got their own recommendations?
The goat is back
Azula getting trapped in the Asylum while Tanya the Evil made it to the Roundtable is wild  EDIT: I forgot about Azula’s mental breakdown. Never mind.
The next physco patient should be Asuna from Mirrai nikki(or in English "Future diaries")
I actually feel bad about Azula's lack of rizz 😂😂😂
Good ass shit
im ngl, hell Kaiser may have to be a future patient & the first YGO head introduced to ya channel lol
3:15 actually, there's an explanation for this goofy aah lookin ass ponytail. Zuko lost his honor, therefore, he had to shave his head, as that's part of fire nation tradition. However, the ponytail is sacred amongst royalty (and Zuko was still royalty). That's why he had to leave this goofy aah lookin ass ponytail on his goofy aah lookin ass head.
damn, the fandom of this show is still active? 😭
Azula was my crush back in the day
She say f that pilot armor bs
I honest to god hope this isn't just for Halloween, cuz this needs to be an entire series. SO MANY FOLKS NEED TO BE LOCKED UP!!  Junko Enoshima Light Yagami At LEAST half of the Kakegurui cast YUNO GASAI
Here since ep one here 👇(yes i liked my own comment)
Fun Fact: Azula is voiced by the same woman who voices Vicky from The Fairly OddParents, Samantha “Sam” Manson from Danny Phantom, Mandy from The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy, Frankie Foster, Duchess, and Goo from Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, Yumi Yoshimura from Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi. And SO much more.
7:50 that Sonic Riders Zero Gravity soundtrack
Cj please make an akame ga kill video or do a disrespectful moments video again
If we include stuff other than anime please add darth maul to the asylum mother fucker was really stomping his foot on his own brothers face having weird ass personality switches and all that crazy shit plus the first time we saw him in person he almost fucking killed anakin as a child  3 seconds in and didn’t say shit like wtf
#ripbozo
ITS A FUCKIN GOOD SUNDAY WHEN CJ UPLOADSSSS
Fun fact (but not actually): In order to really nail azula’s mental breakdown after losing to katara, her VA Grey Delisle has everyone leave the recording studio and dug up the darkest shit in her mind to deliver that incredible performance. She’s said that she’s never actually rewatched the scene because she can’t handle hearing it
Turn to god he’s coming soon and swearings a sin
Hisoka needs to be next
Azula is the Madara Uchiha of Avatar
Yo, the Cohen's masterpiece?! That's a deep cut well done as always!
I know im late. First vid ive ever seen. Im fvkin cryin😂😂😂😂
16:55 had me dead 😂
Bro do the animated joker he was insanely a menace to society
We went from the round table to the asylum. What a journey I’m ready for it🤣💯💯
This might be the perfect place for Cid from Eminence in the shadows
Go over how onizuka is a just straight up pedophile in GTO
This recap is a gem 😂
Yoooo cj this was so great thank you!! Please never stop as long as your happy😂🍻🫶🏽
CJ needs to do Satou Matsuzaka from happy sugar life for this series
Azul inspired Eren 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I just noticed when she was talking ti her mom in the mirror that  was when he mental state was broken because if her mom was behind her why did she throw the rock at the mirror instead of behind her
I need you to make a video on Shadow from Eminence in the shadow!!!! Bro got hands for days
Anyone thinks he should do she belongs to the streets series
Ozai really gave Zuko the napoleon treatment
No one ever thought it didn't make sense that IROH of all people is who got caught off guard?
Can't wait to see what's
If it was straight boxing... Ty Lee washes Azula, I'm certain of it. That's all.
The channel's case studies broaden FOR THE BETTER! love this new section
Mr.Quality over Quantity.
PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: PIGEONS CAN LACTATE
Ozai banishing Zuko was really the biggest blessing in disguise in history. Because if Zuko was able stick around, he’d definitely be as messed up as Azula….or dead.
10:25 somebody has actually vandalized the Great Wall of china
Aang, Zuku and Azula really did have a triple threat match lmao. That intro was the equivalent of Shawn Micahels superkicking Triple H back when they had that Triple Threat with Cena 😂😂😂
WE MAKING IT OUT OF ARKHAM WITH THIS ONE 🗣🔥🔥🔥
Azula is the poster child for daddy issues
A new series!?!? LETS GOOOO
ok so will we get a kira asailum video?
Really thought Azula was gonna join the round table. And i was here for it
Black lagoon  Balalaika or the monstrous twins.
I can fix her
Can u make killua from hunter to the round table
johan from monster you have to do johan from monster
CJ stop blocking viewers in Japan. I can never tell when you have a new video unless I use a vpn.
She a baddie ngl
This was fire but the next one that should go on this is jinx from arcane
whats the aaahh song
i watched the full thing and this nigga was a fucking demon then grittfh and joker combined💀
No , not the Skyrim Music 😂
It’s kinda sad that the only reason Azula can’t do her own hair is because her mum never taught her too and she always had her servants do it for her
bro , how do i make her mine
This video should have longer because there is more moments 😆 but good video
Next up on the Asylum series: Yuno Gasai from Mirai Nikki!

You should do Cid Kagenou next
Ty lee really is if the colour pink was a person

I have a question: Is John Constantine from the DC universe worthy enough to join the round table coz I wanna see a video about him if possible
Do the guy from " am I the strongest " He mass murderers bandits  Before turning into a power ranger because his sister gets off to it

Bro the girl voice need to go
What happened to black Air Force activity 😭
I had a crush on that crazy ass bitch while watching the series😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤
Hold up if she already maxed the meter then what's going to happen when the clown prince of crime, the Harlequin of hate. THE JOKER 🃏 makes his appearance that crazy SOB beat a robin with a crowbar then blow his ass up for getting in batman and his game, he cut his own face of to fuck with batman, the time he got bored with batman he planted a nuke in metropolis that would go of if lois lane died then fear gased superman to kill Lois while she was pregnant with superman's kid. The crazy meter is going to quit when he steps up to the plate.
Jesus I’m gonna have to rewatch Avatar for the 4th time, bc I don’t rm Azula taking over the Earth kingdom
I love this idea already! I am rewatching Happy Sugar Life and would love to hear what you have to say about Satou Matsuzaka!

The Fire Nation City Girls 😭
@Cj_DaChamp next one definitely gotta be yuno from futrue diary

Ironic how this got released few days before her redemption arc comic comes out
Homelander better be in the next episode

Bubble bass black force trial??

Cj….I don’t think you should be bad mouthing Azula fam…she may come after you.
But didn't Aaron ager broke the same rule to?😅
69k likes
She’s insane but afo made so many fatherless kids 😂
I can fix her
azula is the best written character in avatar, from proud and powerful to insane and unhinged.
That girl's a Queen. I like them crazy
Nah bro, the CoD zombies reference nd sound effects are INSANE.. 😭😭
When I was younger I thought that Azula was Zuko's Older Sister, then years later when I re-watched the series I found out it was the other way around the whole time.
So youtube sent me the notification that cj had uploaded right now, 2 days after he uploaded. That’s an unforgivable crime of the highest order youtube!
I like this series already. 😂if only CJ could add Mrs. Robinson from The Amazing World of Gumball
Next talk about the lich
She pulled the Itachi stance
Why dawg sound like a modern woman wen he had that discussion between Azula nd Tai Lee.. 😭😭
Bruh I haven’t watched all of Avatar since I was 9 i really couldn’t appreciate just how much of a crazy bitch Azula was back then😂😂😂 this one of those shows you gotta rewatch as an adult to probably fully pick up on everything 💯
A new series? I thought Halloween was coming up, not Christmas!
Great!👏👏👏👏👏 I am glad you switched it up. Too many people were taking your style.
Here, you better upload moar
Love "The Asylum" idea
Moro Has Black Air Force Energy Dragon Ball Super Manga
If you pay attention in that scene 4:06, the captain's no longer there in the shot and the reason for that is because a behind the scenes fact tells that Azula uh.... *incinerated* bro.
Azula flirting, was kinda electrifying
😂😂😂😂😂 she fuckin Crack da meter damn can't see dat top lol
We need Taiju Shiba that’s a cold man🥶🥶🥶
I think you should do the joker next.

Go to 22:43 and turn on CAPSNOS
Go to 18:30
I can fix her
CJ using tekken 8 soundtracks before the games even out and still hasnt covered the mishimas
Im looking forward to when we get to Junko Enoshima, lets just say if fictional characters were real and I had the ability to she'd be the first person I'd hunt down. (Followed by Tomura shigaraki because hes genuinely terrifying season 6, and then the celestial dragons because there just the worst)
Asylum vid for shishigami⁉️
7:04 got me lmao💀💀
We need a One piece crocodile episode!
Growing up, azula was the baddest bitch ever, making a nigga like crazy bitches fr
I like this new series quite a bit so far. You should definitely have Minatsuki Takami from deadman wonderland on here. I won’t spoil anything, but she is probably the craziest character in anime history. Her backstory is tragic to say the least. I think she would be perfect for your asylum series.
🔥🔥🔥
I would love to see you do something like this but for Bill Cipher
u gotta do the anime school days next
The crazy french lady Madagascar 3 need one next
Bros like cory always leaving 🙄buh W comeback
Toph: "I'll be able to tell if you're lying" Azula: "Are you sure? I'm a pretty good liar. I'm 400 ft tall purple platypus bear with pink horns and silver wings." Toph: "...Ok, you're good, I admit it."
Morreee I neeedddd morrreeeeeee😡
There was nothing more but just Insanity in the show whenever she showed up
The Milkman Cometh
23:26 ngl...that scene was heavy to watch
my favorite part in atla is when zuko is getting a pep talk from iroh and goes "im sure you want me to work things out with azula, uncle" and iroh just goes "hell no, bitch is crazy, she needs to be taken down."
I can fix her.
Ill take my chances with the devil himself before i take my chances with azula she out here breaking the rules of anime had the whole world thinking aang was dead she was a high key menace to the entire show
18:01 is her video in works my friend?
“Light the net on FIRE” Bro not the Madagascar 3 reference and they in the circus too dear god 💀
The RoundTable of Menaces. W CALLOUT
smash next
18:42   If I saw azula like that, best know I AM GOING FERAL ON HER!!!!!
Pls....roberta would eat her
17:07 LMFAOOOOOOOOOO NOT THE POLAR EXPRESS 😭😭😭😭

na azula is just straight feral. too conniving for her own good
Not much ppl watch higurashi I'm alr knowing u finna go off for satako cuz wtffff she's needed in da asylum at dat age for da shii she did💀
"Fuck yo transformation! This ain't no anime, nigga!" 🤣🤣🤣
Chill out with the pornstar shit. Some of us are in relationships and like to watch it with our girls….
When a Youtuber can singlehandedly come up with better material than million dollar networks.
The background music @24:00 it sounds so familiar I just can't think where it came from if somebody knows what it is let me know.
I wanna see more crazy things now. Love this.
W new series
Les go u answered my request
do eminence in shadow please bruh
yo please do eminence in shadow next i promise you the mc is a being to be feared
You need to do a bad ass Iroh episode
Azula was goated.

@CJ Dachamp plssssss do a review on Gurren Lagann I beg youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
azula Is up there with yuno gasai, joker, Jason mommas character in fast x, Cypher, sheev palpatine and siri (in the boondocks)

Dude este wey me agregas 😂
Couldn’t of picked a better song at the conclusion by the way, shadows of evil game end finished this perfectly.
Just waiting for CJ to finally put black force stamp on Toji from JJK
This game me chills the asylum
I like the asylum
That was great I'm definitely looking forward to the next one
If it's possible because anime hasn't caught up to the manga, Mahito from JJK deserves to be here. You know exactly why
Cj dachamp should put the cupcake from the fnaf movie in the round table of menaces
more avatar
I can fix her fr fr
who else is waiting for The video on TOJI the god himself
Bro where have you been like bruh I be waiting for so long next time pls try to make more
Weee 9:29
Azula was bae growing up lol
Oh nah Azula makes Vera, Juri, A.K.I and Android 21 look like the most sane person on Earth.
Nah I always felt bad for azula. She was a whole ass child that was hated by both her parents and didn't no anything. I wish she'd had a redemption arc in Korra or something
I am so hyped for this series man. This opens up so many new possibilities for videos.  You NEED to do a video on that mf Hisoka.
She was bad as hell during her downword spiral. Idk why they gave her such thick lips and long luscious hair bro when she's supposed to be crazy af. Lil me forgot about all other girls
waitin for S2 of TR black Air Force energy
That was the greatest run back of Avatar. That just made me wanna rewatch it and have CJ the champ giving it play by play
How the fuck are Generals weaker then the black ops
I can fix her
Hear me out azula kinda bad
There's something seriously wrong with me cause as the video continued i actually became Attracted to her?!
i am new here what is this channel about
Ive been waiting for this.
Can you do garou next
If Azula or character like her came out now, she’d be seen as a hero an a pop icon. “Girl boss.” 😅
N*ggas be out here sayin they can fix her
Great to watch anime with you again! Dunno which one this is, but i aint here for that. You're funny as hell.
Azula Boiling Rock Comic
Fye🔥 Please do The Kingdoms of Ruin next
ngl she would belong both in the round table and here
I'm not gonna lie, I like your content, just this one, doesn't really vibe with me since I literally have no backing of avatar at all, so this was just very confusing, but I can see the spirit so good video
so we have the roundtable for the peeps that just ooze menace and now the asylum for the most mentally deranged fictional peeps oof
16:42 🤣
Imagine being the sibling of azula. One like one prayer for Zuko.
Bro, I hate to be that guy, but I know I can fix her😩
yooo it's been 4 years glad to see a vid cj
Not only are we blessed with another banger from CJ, but a new concept. Love the new idea of the asylum! Keep up the great work man!
If only Azula wasn't like this breeh
That was one of your best plays proves to the world woman can't handle power
ayo, dont you DARE disrespect little Tom-Tom!! man's might have a forehead-hairbun. but that dont make that future Drummer-boy any less a part of the hype-squad.
Bro please make a video on Record of Ragnarok pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.......
Love how in the buying when she tried to get Zuko the voice-over lined up with the what it looked like he was saying
Imagine how terrifying Azula would be if Avatar wasn’t a kid’s show
Azula def had a influence in the women I choose tbh
Crazy part is Aang wasn't even in a coma. He straight up died, if only for a short time. By the grace of God and some magic water, Katara barely managed to bring him back to life. Azula temporarily destroyed the entire Avatar line and nearly won the war and her brother in one go. That's ridiculous.
bro you gotta do yuno from the future diary she literally spun back to another dimension just to get back with my boy yuki
So yeah, all the times Kora lost a fight yeah cause I never lost faith nope he also never needed assistance nope man anyone that tells me that Karen is a shitty avatar Just miss me with that
We need one for the loveable idiots called *Goofy Ahh Guardians*
I enjoyed this one. The Asylum might be my new series to watch RELIGIOUSLY. great work.👍🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Nahhh would Smash Azula
Day 2445 of askin cj to put Griffith on the round table hold of menaces
This new series is gonna be lit.
Man I love her doe. She might be crazy but I Ain ever want her dead for sun reason I jus felt bad for her
I don’t know why I thought he said “ladies and gentleniggas”
?????????14:24?????????
Who would win in a battle of whits? Princess Renner from Overlord or Azula from Avatar?
Im deadddd bruh this shit too funny 😂😂🙏🏿
azula has black force activity and 5 tier insanity like put her in both
Oh my God I can't wait for junko and great videos
13:00 😂🤌🏽
Can can u please do a video about joker having black air forces please I beg
Excellent choice to start off this series 🤣🤣. Azula was on some mental shit fr 😭
Try making a video about assassination classroom
After Toji vs Dagon next week I believe we have enough evidence for him to be added in the black Air Force table….
azula not thaaaat crazy... i could fix her...
18:50 what’s the Anime name
Nice new series tbh…let’s see how many channels steal THIS idea lol
Why am I just now watching this on Netflix I grew up on this
Tanya should be patient 002
Do rayman
Anime lovers and cartoon lovers can all agree on 1 thing that atla is a goated show thats all i have to say ladies and gentelmen🙌
Finally bro
Shou Tucker next
"I can fix her"
I'm here cj late but here
Dog you NEED to make one on Kageno from Eminence in Shadow
Dawg Azula is one of the finest bitches from our childhood easy
candidate for next Episod: Saga of Tanya the Evil
8:23 “Is that an overgrown SALAMANDER?” *shows a picture of an Axolotl*
My only hope for this series is that someone is going to be so insane that he's going to break the insanity meter
Now we gotta wait for another year before CJ drop another video C’mon man just drop at least 2 videos per month
I have some of the comic books and it gets even worse in the comic's
Have to do that bitch from future diary! What was her name?
Sauce for 3:26 ?
This new series is crazy LITERALLY 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Cj I hope you could make the next asylum episode with, Kengan Ashura characters, because ngl some of them mfs lowkey needa be put in Alcatraz
I CAN FIX HER
High noon that reminds me of a man with a mustache
This gonna be the "I can fix her" series fr lmao
Watching that Agni Kai at the end was so conflicting because u could tell how much she was actually suffering yet at the same time it didn’t justify all the atrocities she committed.
I always loved Azula when I was a kid because she was strong and smart. It was funny seeing her manipulate others and constantly taunt them lmao.  One of my favorite characters growing up.
Nah she could still get it tho
She still bad tho,(I could change her 😭)
you know it’s a good day when DA CHAMP himself uploads
The is no war in Ba sing se
😍😍😍🤗🤗🤗🤗
yo CJ, good idea for the series keep that fire up mandem💯
I see Pickle is not being watched at the moment I wonder if he escaped.
16:50 jumpscare
Dude I love you’re content bro feels like old YouTube
Still hope to see a DBZ Tournament Of Power Video or a Jiren video :D
Bro POST MORE
CJ DA CHAMP POSTEDDDDDD
I always thought azula was bad and badder even after the asylum
No roundtable?
Plz do Black force energy Z with Ayanokoji
Azula nearly wiped out the avatar line
To think if Azula had actually found someone who could've taught her some common sense without any fear maybe she could've made some different choices in her life... Maybe even realized that there was more to her life than her controlling father.
Azula can do anything she wants to me I don't care
Y’all need to get yunno from the future diary
We need more videos
I can fix her
If you're heading an asylum now you gotta talk about sato from ajin, you might have to read the manga for him because the anime started doing its own thing midway through but trust me its worth the read, the shit he pulled had bin laden looking like a fraud
YO ON SUM REAL SHIT CJ GOATED IAM SO GLAD HES MAKING THE ASYLUM I DIE LAUGHING EVERYTIME I WATCH A NEW VID
Would jinx be part of that group?
17:53 I would havt taken her up on dat offer👀
I can fix her
I know a lot of dudes that would risk it all for someone like azula.
The wait was worth it
Your back
bruh...ong Azula the type of girl i need in my life.
Azula broke the first anime rule in the anime book attacking the main character mid transformation
Owloo and CJ at the same day it must be the end of the world
Pound town on her
i like how destroying a sand castle has the equivalent psycho scale as ruling an entire kingdom
Top tier video this man is a online treasure 😂
Yo CJ, when you gonna do JUNKO  Im ready for niggas to see true INSANITY!!!! she is on level 7 of the asylum under impel down!!
Girl’s menace aura is related E for everyone
This how you know they couldn’t redeem her cause that brother sister jumping combo was just too A1 and if she joined team avatar with zuko ozai would’ve been packed up in a day
Quizzy On Demand brought me here. This video is hilarious! Your voice overs were perfect. 😆
I'm shocked Azula bullshitting Toph's lie detector never came up because that was next level insane. That alone shows you just how psychotic girls gotta be
Azula is so insane she's using techniques from another universe like who teach her that fire rasenshuriken 😂😂😂 that looks dope as hell
I am a very big fan and I will love it if u can do Kira from jojos bizarre adventure next in the serie THE ASYLUM ❤
MAMA!!!!, CJ THE CHAMP DROPPED😭😭😭🙏🙏
Azula is a menace lets accept that fact. But she was too arrogant and boastful which caused her downfall.
Expecting hisoka as patient 002
16:53
That ffx jecht music was spot on 😊😅
NAH THE SEXY RED PART OF THEM EMOTING IS FUNNY 😭
This lowkey made me want to rewatch avatar🔥
Azula was such an interesting character
And he is back yeah baby 😊😊😊😊
I feel like half the round table could fit into this series as well, lol
i could fix her don't worry guys
bro mke more of this
Azula was and is lowk tweakin  idk if she’s in the new avatar (forgot the name with korra) but if she was in there she would either be on dt or reflected on her actions (10% chance)
cj your late again!!!
WE NEED DOFLAMINGO NEXT!
Dubs is better
Damn Cj really out here with 4 jobs. Being a counselor/judge for the round table of black airforces,a youtuber,and now a mad scientist in the asylum of insanity?Man is out here making bread
Funny a new video
She still one of the baddest
Okay, Buu oped mother fuckers in heaven...  But Azula nearly Oped an entire lineage of Gods.  Practically the equivilent of going back in time and erasing them from existence.  This is how fire benders cook 🔥  Shame that she went out like scrambled eggs at iHop 💀
14:29 is something that I never knew I needed in this life. And yet,here it is,and I am all hear for it. I wonder if Aang had the same barber as Connie from AoT.
Lolol
I can fix her.
CJ If you want to make another episode of The Asylum Please make a video on Cioccolatta and Secco
I love the black air force energy of The Round Table, but I'm hyped as hell for the batshit crazies that will make up The Asylum series.
"The ASYLUM" I fuck with the name that shit roles off the tongue
This was kind of shit
azula can still catch it
What about sanity level???
I got some suggestions for both this new facility and for the roundtable. For the asylum, Akutagawa from Bungo Stray Dogs and Mori (also from BSD) for the roundtable because of everything he does throughout the entire series.
I rewatched this last month and I have to say it’s actually one of the best written stories I love how everyone has their own lessons to learn throughout best love story/friendship building redemption
Avatar, such a revolutionary show that people still do video essays till this day
The captain is a real dub
Dude makes S tier content but only uploads once a month.
When are you gonna do one on Toji fushiguro 😤😤😤?????
Azula is still one of Nickelodeon's Best Villains so after seeing her explosive debut on Nick All-Star Brawl 2,I'm glad you talked about her.
All this girl needs some good loving 😂if u know what I mean
If this a series do yuno from future diary
Halloween is nicee is the next month video thanksgiving theme?
This was so good! I would love to see one of these on Jinx from Arcane, she would fit right into the Asylum. Hallucinations,   ptsd, terrorism, she got the whole package
22:37 welp here’s one lesson I’ve learned before watching this, if you get into a fight, Stfu!!
Nahhhh the Azula Rizz part had me holding my head
Shes even more crazy in the comics
Bruh this shit is LEGIT hilarious 😂😂😂
I'm pretty sure the mosr common reaction to azula's rizz is either "what the fuck?" "WHAT. THE. FUCK?" or "What the actual fuck?!"
Lenarr doodoo song is funny 🤣
Azula is the Pure Harted Insanity Mence of All The Last Airbender Series from entire serie non-stop hunting for every single person she's going after then manipulating almost every person she knows that tells one thing.... Where Odin or The Joker when needing them for this
CJ you dont miss my friend. Great work
Drop more
I don’t think you’re supposed play volleyball with your feet
Aye Cj cod zombies ending song on the outro was beautiful.
I just realized he dosent have a griffith one thats crazy!!!
Azula got me with that rizz 16:40.
PLS DO ENOSHIMA NEXT😍
I can save her
lit
I am very surprised that Goji wasn’t brought up in the black Air Force round table. Maybe he’ll be brought up in the asylum
Azula would be a formidable batman villain
Who the blonde girl in the beginning 1:01
Cj make vids every two weeks cause you funny af 😂 monthly i such a long wait
Wow he uploaded lmao
The aggression against tom-tom was O.D. 😭
@Cj Dachamp I petition Knives from Trigun for the Asylum.
Gotta comment frm my other acc but da champ is back at it againnnnn😭‼️
I dig the series man I love it
Do saitama
Azula quickly became that villian that you could not wait for her to get it in the end! Perfectly Executed Villainess!!!! ❤
love the content CJ :)
You should do Wanda Maximoff next.
Ty Lee is such a joyful character. She’s my favorite girl in Avatar The Last Airbender.
Bruh, Azula scratched the top of Zuko's head😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yo da cj face cam was crazy!! 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Cj what the f is going on 0:41
You need to make a video on Douglas Bullet bruh he's literally RADIATING with black airforce energy.
Wtf is this Cj.
11:29 basically Biden right now
I MISS YOU MAN PLEASE MAKE MOREEE
Azula is the epitome of "I don't just support women's rights, I support women's wrongs." Because I still say her crazy ass deserves a spot on the round table.
3,978 comment
Been waiting 3 months for new vid bro
Ight then put the berzerk scene on this series
"I gotta take a doodoo I gotta take a doodoo YEAH!!!" 😂😂😂
I'm  surprised champ didn't get john wick in the black airforce committee
The fact that in the comics after she tried to flatline her mom and kidnapped tom-tom is just wild🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
Yes just yes
She's so bad, but she's so good....
Do hisoka asylum table and kid gaara’s black airforce round table.
Amazing video brother 10/10❤ plz continue making these Avatar videos but some character analysis videos on the main benders and there fights etc! Keep it pushing dawg😅
80k likes then can you make a joker video
JINX JINX JINX JINX JINX
14:23 Hot.
Top  3 haters: 1. Dio 2. Stinkmeaner 3. Slade 4. Frieza 5. Azula This may change over time
SKeeYee😂😂😂
There is actually a reason for Zuko's haircut in Book 1. The top-knot is worn by royalty and those that are banished are suppose to shave their heads. So that's why he has pretty much just enough hair to have a ponytail, it shows that he is banished-royalty. Zuko's hair throughout the series is suppose to match his character as he progresses.
Azula is still bae
17:56 thank you for this lenarr reference
dam is all i have to say
Azula is the goat. naming my future daughter that
Need another vid
I like the switch from the round table to the asylum
azula was lowkey her my nigga
Yes!!! a new vid AND it’s about my fav Nickelodeon show🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yeah ain’t help at some point in the comics she basically developed a Brother Complex 😑
Riley Reid??
great that you chose Azula first for this, this will make her upcoming father’s episode even more insane
Is this the scp foundation?
"How many animals ya'll got!?..Release all them N****'s!!" 👁👄👁 Cj you wild!
Ayo this video is gas. I want to see more of the asylum episodes
Cj out here innovating while synsei making "the art of reverse jumping shonen edition part 7"
Nah bro was gonna die anyways also L intro wasnt scary
Also the round table is packed af Also half the round table should be in the asylum
Lol 😂 wont lie 08 me was down bad for her. Its always the crazy
7:14 Poor Tom-Tom got the Tinder logo on his head 😭😭😭
I love how Ozai sounds like Ruckus, it’s a perfect comparison
Keep em coming muhboi
Tai lee is soo badd
You gotta do sensui from yu yu hakusho that Mf was crazy asl
Dawg you're not consistent with your vids 😭😭
CJ I didn't know you watched Danganronpa, YOU GOTTA DROP A JUNKO VIDEO SHE IS A FOUNDER

“Azula wasn’t so bad it was her dad’s manipulation”…”azula only wanted to kill zuko cuz of her father”💀I swear everyone ignores the scenes of them as kids when she’s still teasing and trying to kill his ass for no reason other than she’s a fucking crazy asshole😂😂😂
Azula low key bad
its been 84 years...  ...and well worth it as usual.
FW this
azula is now a part of the gotham asylum xD but wait who says she nerver was it befor....this bitch is crazy as hell,as kid  (how do i say this...) she reminds me of my older sister xD
Hear me out
I need it(her)
Beautiful vid 😍
Yo CJ! Do Medusa from Soul Eater next. Bitch is a crazy with being a manipulator and a horrible mom
Just a reminder, Azula is one of those villains that manage to kill (technically speaking) off the main character of a show. If Katara didn't have that special healing water, Aang would've stayed dead. Remember what Roku said  "If you are killed in the Avatar State, the reincarnation cycle will be broken, and the Avatar will CEASE to exist"
This is gonna be a great series,  so cool
Welcome to the asylum 001 azula😂
Shigaraki from My Hero Acedemia would be a good one. Or Bill Cipher from Gravity Falls. And Vicky from Fairly Odd Parents.
Can we get Light Yagami for the next Asylum
Ty-LEE 😛😋
NIGGA U AINT DONE WITH THIS AZULA EPISODE SO GET UR ASS BACK TO WORK PLEASE AND THANKYOU
Who knew Azula and Eren were on the same level 😅
bro made arkham with drip
Something obscure that I appreciate in CJ’s vids is his use of PvZ GW music cuz I love the GW series to death
17:45 no no no! I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT! bro im sitting up at work banging on the table, laughing so hard I gave myself a headache 😂😂😂 💀
AZULA CAN GET ITT RAHHHH
Trapping Aang inside that building with a ring of fire is a whole def jam reference💀 Cj you should’ve played that song by Sticky fr
Todays is my birthday and the best day and even ,y fav YouTuber uploads after a. Mounth thx for you countent
Zuko and Katara lucky she had that breakdown cus that fight wouldn't have ended like that
Gotta do ol’ girl from to your eternity at some point
Cj you have to do insomniac venom
I wonder who will be next in the asylum
One fact: The Dai Li was formed and trained by Avatar Kyoshi herself.
You have to make a video about Takamura from hajime no ippo
10:20 nah the plants vs zombies music is perfect here 😂
i love this one
in other words... she's cold af
Can you do casca from berserk next 💀
Decent video.
Yeah, he locked her and her dad up and went to find him mom because in asian culture, they didnt kill their spouse, they banished them and Zuko knew that.
Can you make more episodes of the asylum?😊😊
Nah he was dead ….protagonist killer
No hold ,Azula can GET it.
Azucena theme Peru stage  from Tekken 8 nice.
irohs reverse lighting gave me chills
You don't need to put Hisoka445 in "The Asylum", you need to put him in "The Jail"
16:51 LMFAO!!
You got to feel bad for Azula she is a victim of poor parenting from both sides. A father that only saw her as a weapon and a mother that just up and left without even a goodbye (sad as she was quick to give one to the kid that always crying) .
shes actually my first crush.. shego aint shit
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN 👿
For All of you who don't know in comics Azula gets a new face and dissapears after finding out Zukos mother did same thing and Ozai was not even Zukos dad so Azula was plotting on him again trying to take the throne but bish just disappeared PS: read the comics i left out hella info
She kinda bad tho
SHE BELONGS HERE THE PINNACLE OF BEING A MENACE 💀
Been waiting for u to drop
Do guts
Do kid buu next 😫😫🙏😈🙏🙏🙏🙏
great fuccin episode
My dude is back !
Bruh I remember every week or so it was a new episode of Azual chasing team avatar I was like who tf is this bitch 😂😂😂
He's back
Can't wait to see Eren, from Attack on Titan series, have an episode
14:23 Bad ending   14:29 flash ending
Plz do Yami Yugi from Yugioh season 0, he's a menacto society
What’s the ost from 22:17 ?
If Azula does not go insane she wins that fight she only lost because she was not in the right state of mind
Azula was that one character that we all had a crush on and is the reason we want females to spit on us and stomp on our sacks 🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴
Banger this is really good start
I thought nothing was gonna top the itachi pause...until I got hit with the Uncle Ruckus card😂
you should make it so -there are 5 lvs of insanity -each leval has its own bar -u gues what level of crazy they are -if they fill up the bar the surpass ur expectations moving on to next lv -insteading of calling it the reabibiltation call it inspection or evaluation.(aint no helping them) -
I never thought he’d make a black Air Force of a cartoonish anime
She came onto the show, clowned Zuko, held her own against multiple powerful benders, BREACHED a city that's supposed to be impenetrable, clowned the Kyoshi warriors, took over Ba Sing Se and the secret police from the inside, BURNED Long Feng without even using firebending, nearly killed the Avatar AND ENDED the cycle and would have done it had Katara not had magic spirit water juice, outsmarted Team Avatar and held them off without her bending, and even when she was mentally unstable, managed to fight pretty even with Zuko until he tried baiting her to use her lightning. That's not even getting into the comics. Azula was BUILT DIFFERENT. A tragic story but absolute savage on the battlefield.   "Don't flatter yourself. You were never even a player"
Azula is wild
13:25 was a fire ass giratina battle them insert 😤
My friends hates azula bruh but me nah I can fix her she needs me
Start of a new series ? Let's go 😂
Dude Kira is my favorite JoJo
Do Light Yagami!
Now that this is happening I expect to see Light Yagami on this Asylum. He's perfect for this type of stuff. It all started from touch the Death Note and bam.
only if I chould subscribe atleast 2 times I will be satisfied.
Iroh a real one the uncle we all need
Ok so my girlfriend of the Avatar series is not going to the round table of Black air force energy we have Jail sounds about right
Junko Enoshima And Setsuna kiryu should definitely be in this series
She definitely deserves the black air force
Azula wasn't just crazy, she was a bitch!
I can't wait for more of these videos.
No lie loved that shit
finally bro i love avatar
NICE VIDEO
Goooooonnn
When you gonna do bleach
Bro searched up bust on insta reels for that gif ifykyk
17:46 💀💀💀
I look forward to this series. Can't wait to see if Light yagami is in it. Dude does think he's a god after all. A lot of the round table could be put in the asylum to come to think of it. Kid gara from Naruto is definitely a must, until they put his ass on meds 😆.
10:41 excuse me... *_H      O      W      ?      !_*
i am assuming himiko toga is next because Who else?
Our first time seeing someone having lvl 5 sanity meter that's crazy.
I can fix her fr
13:01 Uncle Ruckus 😂😂😂
Finally a new vid
10:54 can't beat plot armour
I know who should be 002 it should be Yuno Gasai from future diaries
Azula was so Bad tho I anit going lie I would’ve tried to smash.
W fucking video as usual...loving the new series already...started off witta banger
Quick reminder that while she’s murdering main characters, taking out impenetrable cities and general gaslight, gatekeep, girlboss activity She’s 14
CJ please make an Eminence in Shadow vid! BRO CID IS AN ABSOLUTE MENACE!!!!!
W vid
YO I love this new series!!!! This is a perfect addition to the craziness 😅
12:03 "Potara got jumped"   Vegito: huh?
When the screen cut to you after Azula fumbled so hard I just lost all control of laughter
Bro i can fix her
Can you make a video about Cletus kasady (carnage) how crazy he is
👁👄👁 . 😂 👁👄👁. 😂
She’s too far gone
Send homelander ass to the asylum next😂
Need more asylum videos I like this new series lol
petition to have RANDY ORTON as the next patient
Azula was born a monster, lived a monster and remembered as a monster
Bro is the opp
Azula didn't have mommy issues or Daddy issues. She just had issues
The skyee did it😂🤣 best video ever lowkey🤣🤣🤣🤣
I can fix her
Dec nefario
I still would
btw someone ACTUALY took an excavator to the great wall of chine a few weeks ago  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Dude was lucky, got to kiss her.
I don't believe there's a crazier female than azula.
Ironically enough, she was still best girl
W
ADD IROH TO THE ROUND TABLE
Straight fire
I had no clue she could be considered a menace, I'll edit this comment after I finish the video Edit: I think this would be a great series but let's be honest joker belongs on both this and the roundtable
Liked this video before the first minute was over
who else sees all these npc comments
Good to have you back once again, Cj 😊  But for real, Azula is wild, and definitely deserves her spot there. Junko and the Joker are pretty obvious nominees, and I think two more good ones would be Yuno Gasai and Eric Cartman
N to imagine she is only 14💀
Tbh I would have married Azula if she said what she said to chan to me
Imo I think Azula actually feels just as inferior to Zuko as he thinks he is to her, she just masks her alot better through her attitude and actions. Azula hates the fact that she felt her morher looked at her as a menace and just wanted to be loved the same way Zuko hates that his father deems him as weak. She acts like it doesn’t bother her but deep down it ate away at her as the show went on we first see true signs at the beach when she talk about it & then again when she sees her mothers image in the mirror and cries when her mother says “bo I live you Azula” it eats away at her so she fully embraced the power she had as princess to rule & down on Zuko for not doing the same thus why she tries to set him up for failure especially in season 3. However, as Zuko become stronger and is able to fight her as an equal & eventually leaves the fire nation to join team avatar this infuriates her because now the powers she had over her brother in regards to being better than him is now gone because he doesn’t care about that anymore. I do believe they do care about eachothher though because we see small hits of it throughout the show & even in the comic when their older and actual find their mother. I can’t wait for the new animated movie of all of them as adults it will be great
Azula is cold, she killed the main character and was psyched when Zuko screamed in agony during the Agni Kai, I can’t get over that part
The off a perk line sent me lmfao 😂😂😂😂
Oh nah I’m lovin the new series 😭🙏
💫💫💫💫the Goat is back. Nice video
Can’t even lie, Azusa is easily one of the baddest bitches in fiction. Crazy? Absolutely. But she put in WORK.
How much yall wanna bet joker is gonna be  on this mfer 😂
CJay Azula is giving Jordan Peele's Meegan
Bruh can you make an Eminence in Shadow vid plz,there are lots of savage moments
Dope. Looking forward to the new series. Seems like you been busy cookin up after all
idk bro i say azula is wife matrial you always need someone to watch the voices behind your back... i mean i trust her with a knife to defend me
yooooo
I can fix her.
If griffin does not get put at the round table of black air forces, something going down
W ass new series bro can’t wait to see more fr🔥  You gotta do yuno Gasai😭🤣
23:31 is that broly!
9:58 made me realize Azula was that bitch, it was a 1v 6 and she was able to get away..
19:38 to 19:55 makes me laugh so much 😂
i can fix her
W
My mom gave me these muscles had me gasping for breath 😆
Azula is a menace and a psycho
Azula maxed every stat except charisma
Maybe make a Cyberpunk Edgerunners video next
I was excited for just a new CJ vid. But now to see a new SERIES? Covering THIS god-tier lunatic? Hell. Yes.
I have been waiting for this one cj 🎉
Azula did a lot was able to do the thing her uncle the dragon of the west everyone saw him as before his son died in ba sing and took over the earth king do defeated a avatar even in the avatar was at lowest the third strongest fire bender had to have a mental breakdown for zuko to even have a chance to defeat her even after he unlocked a special version of fire bending
Pickle would probably be part of this sanity meter shit but he aint
ive never noticed her hitting that itachi pose that clean liike that
If Harley Quinn is not patient 002 then I don't know why the asylum was created
You should have dropped this on Halloween, still a fire video though
Bro need to add that one crazy bitch from overlord that collected those plates
Had me dying as usual. Can't wait for the Junko episode
Please do Ranko from Akiba Maid war for the round table.
Think I'm more curious about this then the round table lol
May I suggest Himiko Toga or Yuno Gasai for the next patients 🧐
The grandma's twerking got it bro 😭
Reverse flash is a perfect candidate in the asylum
Ayo this new asylum series is fire bro. Can't wait to see thé next patients on your list. By the way great edit as usual those photoshops pics always kills me bruh. Keep going Champ.
"CJ Dr. T isn’t real. He can't hurt you" CJ Dr. T:
lowkey need a fire nation city girls t shirt
This video was just hilarious to wach
Great vid cj
Dj Da Champ 🏆 God made you in my time for a reason. Love the work you're doing and I appreciate you for making great content and memories I can live on with. Keep up the humor as well ❤️‍🩹
smash. next question
“‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind'. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.” Matthew 22:37-40
0:25 that's a fire way to expand on the whole court things Yoh that's big brain
14:00 She just committed anime taboo. I'M SORRY BUT LOCK HER UP.🤯
Man, Azula is a great example if having a villain that you understand that reason behind the fuckery, but not forgetting or forgiving it.
Junko from Danganropa if you know you know
honestly a good idea for a series, wee all know there are some crazy ass, demented characters anime & cartoon world
I always felt bad for Azula and always will, she deserved better, even from uncle iroh.
Can't wait for Yuno gassai
How is The Joker not first!?
Bro so happy you starting this off with one of my favorite characters. Azula full psycho. Looking forward to this series (but you best not give up on the round table tho nigga 😑)
She did all that crazy stuff......AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN!!!!  In the comics, oh boy I tell you
If this wasn't a show for younger audiences Azula would have a body count  Anytime she was on screen you knew either somebody was on edge or the Gaang was running
Azula I can change her.
Good stuff.  Jokes were solid.  Presentation was genius level.
Light Yagami gotta get an episode
😂😂😂😂 dude had ‘homies over hoes’ playing in the background
She broke anime rule 3. Stop him mid transformation
I didn't realize how much I missed these because 😆😆😆
imma go azula on you cj if you keep taking them longass breaks
Finally.. been waiting 😂😂😂😂
4:00 the Berleezy voice over always gets me 😂
That psychotic episode at the end tho, she was so FINE
Thank you for coming back bro. Great idea. Wonderful idea!
What is your discord???
TO. THIS. DAY. that captain going "were taking the prisoners home" is one of the funniest moments in the series, i mean how did he fuck that up?
9:46 - 10:03 Azula Going to get Jumped By The Four ELEMENTALS   AANG: AIR KATARA: WATER  TOUPH: EARTH ZUKO: FIRE  This video is My childhood INCARNATE AND I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS!! I SAW THIS ALL THE WAY BACK IN 2007 - 2009 WHEN I WAS 8 - 10 IN THOSE YEARS!!!  Katara with her hair down Had me In LOVE as a kid!!  14:23 WHY FOES AAMG HAVE BOOBIES??  15:59 Zumo with his hair like that... Take me daddy!!!  16:01 - 16:16 When U Are So Broken with Human Hacks That U And your Oneechan, BEAT ONE TEAM 2 - 4, 5, 6, OR 10
W series i cant wait for another chapter
14:24 that Aang image is so cursed it gave me ptsd
My wife
Long Feng to Azula after realizing the Dai Li chose Azula over him: You've beaten me at my own game Azula: Don't flatter yourself. You were never even a player
🤣🤣 I don't think I've laughed this hard for this long. Fire content, bro 🔥🔥🔥
i can fix her
Excited for this series 😂
Don't take a 4 month break ever again 💀 W series tho
Show this video to Grey Griffin right now 😂
YESSSSSSS
Azula Needs sf6 Deejay in her life
You know your timing of this video dropping couldn't be more perfect. Cause they just announced her in Nickelodeon All star Brawl 2 today.
Not gonna lie, Azula was my crush. I knew she was nuts, but that ember island epispde made me mad at that dude that kissed her. Man backed down fast when she showed her evil.
She gets crazier is been a while since i read the comic but after the series ended in the comics azula escape prison and starts to kill zuko polical enemy's.  Zuko be like im trying to be better than father here i don't want this.  Azula: your welcome brother, im just here to help.  Even when she is trying to be good sister she still is a monster.
Love the new series! I’m curious who you plan to do next 😁
NAHHH SHE SAID "My mommy hate me so I am going to kill everyone" GOD
Coochie bandit 445 killed me
yameko next
I can fix her...
Kid with powers
Randy Orton is another one that needs to be locked in that Asylum
The sexy redd memes got me 💀
you Need a whole series for the kakegurui entire verse😂😂
Fire nation city girls is WILD 🤣🤣🤣
This aint even mentioning Hama, old bat was out of pocket the moment we met her.
Azula's such a tragic character like I really sympathize with her so much. I really wished she had a happy ending or got better. She even lost her closest friends Mai and ty Lee and they even betrayed her.
Oh yeah
Nah, azula needs a show or movie where she the main character.
Nah, she did a frontflip and shot a fireball from her feet, she was built different different  But that insanity was next level.....she was literally spitting blue flames after she was captured. Like ma'am what kind of demon are you
If you're branching out, then may I recommend the "at least you tried" awards? Awards for people who got absolutely disrespected, but at least they put up a fight 😅 Off the top of my head, there's some dudes in the Madara fight who deserve this award for at least trying. Or anybody who goes up against kenpachi's big ass. 😂
Where is my black Air Force energy video✋🤓
the ponytail is actually a part of the exile. on some uchiha timing.
How many people gone ride this wave??? 🤔  Cj, Keep doing yo Thang Sir..
At least she tried rizzing
At the end she was fr spitting fire 💀  Whole ass dragon lock her up in a mountain no in a box UNDER the fucking mountain
My name is yoshikage kira I am 33 years old and I..
Honestly Azula deserves a medal for being one of a few characters (the Santa Titan comes to mind) to kill a main character
Hey CJ  love your videos I think I have your next patient Yuno Gasai from Future Diary.
So glad Junko is getting one lmaooo Junko literally is out of pocket💀💀💀
i wasn't expect this. but i probably should have. because.. azula is a dog
WHOA WHOA WHOA.  No. We have already found patient #002. It's cj Dachamp himself for that korra insinuatation. Lock him up
Lowkey this mans music choice is impeccable
Nah it’s worse than this. The comic after was crazyyy 🤣🤣🤣
You already know Cj is killin it when mf'ers wait for him to post, so they can post their reactions first. Also, I didn't watch Avatar til I met my wife. She sold me by telling me, "Oh no, theres a character that isn't even CLOSE to PG.". I said okay. Thankfully, she locked up now in the Asylum lol! Keep killin em Cj
When is the doffy video CJ?
I can fix her
Azula is such a well written character, I’m so excited for her new comic coming out in a few weeks 👀
23:03 I forgot that she KISSED THAT SHIT😭😭😭😭 She’s TOO cold😂
Another Request for the Asylum: Cletus Kasady
Azula 🐱 prolly 🔥 tho 🤷🏾‍♂️
Fantastic
pj azula so fine i hate it
LETS GO THIS IS THE VIDEO I DIDNT KNOW I WANTED BUT NEEDED
All this and he ended on a jazz outro. Man that shits tufff
Cj Dachamp, can u please do the black force energy with Godzilla earth please
Bruh I'm not gonna lie. I was Gaslit as a kid. My taste in women was decimated. It's not healthy but I still see Azula as a queen. Love her. But hate that I do.
It was a great idea to start with Azula. That bitch was crazy 😂😂😂😂
Patient #002 will be the crazy intaganist of To Your Eternity, right
DAAMMNNNN!!!! Bro I love this new series man😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 You're really the best!! I'm so glad I landed my ass on your channel 😅😅😅
There are savages, and then there are the insane
I can fix her
Cj dah goat
Who else you think gonna join her in the Asylum? Edit: Not like I'm gonna get notified anyways because I no longer get notified when my comment gets liked, hearted or received a reply
_===
Finally
CJ THE CHAMP CAN YOU DO JIREN VS GOKU OR ONE PIECE GEAR 5 VS KAIDO OR BIG MOM VS KIDD AND LAW
Log into YouTube and see CJ posted and just like that, my day just got better ❤🔥🔥
STOP POSTING EVERY MONTH PLEASEEEEEEEEEE
Whaaaat??? Cj finally uploaded??? Broski I Luh you but you onnat Coryxkension timing 😭
Azula really said "This is AVATAR!"
Ty Lee hands down the sexiest Western character of all time!
You're back
SATOKO WHY THE HELL DID YOU HIT RIKA WITH YOUR SUITCASE?!
Apparently the ATLA comic writers are giving Azula a redemption arc which is completely unnecessary. She works are a tragic character. A girl broken at her core that won't ever be a good person. I hate when writers take evil characters that gain popularity and feel the need to redeem them. Like how they turn Harley Quinn from a villain to an anti-hero. She worked better as a villain.
I can fix her.
Man for this new series if Mion doesn't make an appearance I will be pissed
Thanks for the upload 😘😘😘😘
Not the ff10 final aeon summoning battle song 🤣 🤌
OK
Honestly, I blame Ozai for her lack of social skills more than her mother. Hell, he’s the whole reason the mother wasn’t even around in the first place
You need to do Jinx from Arcane. Put her ass in the asylum. She needs it. (And yes I know that Jinx is from League of Legends. I’ve never played it and I never will)
This why I love ur channel. I the best cj
@cjdachamp i asked for it yesterday i got it today truly grateful
Azula is EXACTLY what I mean when I say: "I like my Women a bit Crazy!"  🤷🏾‍♂ I want to have HER babies!!!
Waaaaiitt, I hear that Gigan Rocks playing in Omashu. My man is *cultured*
Bro we neeeeed!!! Mugen next
The gaslighting i crzy 💀 plus she got a spinning giant ass dildo 😭😭
When i saw that scene where she striked aang I got so heated  I was so mad dude started punching the air😭    OKAY ONE MORE EDIT AND IMMA SHUT UP  you gus remember that one episode from the boondocks when robert dated that Kardashian girl?
I would like to submit Iris Heart from Hyperdimension Neptunia to the asylum due to the fact her own allies are afraid of her showing up and she'd instantly receive so many restraining orders
Azula could of been a better person if her father weren’t such a prick
FINALLY HE POSTSSSSS AGAINNNNNNNN
Oh good, I thought that Azula was gonna be inducted into the Round Table.
She is even crazier when trying to find her mother..throwing lighting at butterflies and all
I could fix her...
Did anyone click on this thinking it was a sages rain video
could've did a case files type style
Yay the asylum round table 😂😂😂😂 crazy ass mfrs
I GOT TO TAKE A DODO I GOT TO TAKE A DODO 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
i can fix her
🤣 better keep her locked up not trynaa escape 👀 👁👄👁
Bro, i just found this guy like a month ago, i have already seen every video and he still comes with new stuff. Nah bro you are built different
I forgot on how insane azula is 💀
Yes, junko enoshima
Idk if it’s jus me but no way my little sister finna hoe me the way Azula was doing zuko his whole life 😭
Broooo do Shigaraki from my hero, he’s super mental
Need to see Coco from Jormungand in one of these vids
Witch big fake Hugo strange lookin ahhh this shit heat tho I can’t wait to see who’s next to be admitted
Azula is alone, and every action she did was all for nothing.   Zuko had one thing she didn’t have, and needed: People who genuinely care and love her, and who she’ll listen to when she does wrong.   I don’t even think Uncle cares about her, and he usually pities people like her.
Please make an asylum video on yoshekage kira please
With all the shit she did, she should’ve been final boss of the series. Ain’t no way she was getting that redemption arc.
i can fix her😭😭😭
You know this series is gonna be good when he starts off with freaking Azula
Already loving the asylum vibe. An innovative dub imo
Not only did Ozai make her firelord, he made himself the Phoenix king. He made the title of fire lord worthless, something Azula always wanted.
Like the new series dude
Nah I don’t think niggas understand the effort in this edit. Man’s had Thomas the tank engine followed by the Boondocks face off theme 😂😂😂😂
The Zuko Azula team literally never loses. I didnt notice that.
Azula in the comics created the shadow government because she said that if she couldn’t be fire lord she would make zuko into the perfect fire lord
you should do Kira next
That doc face done made me lose my shit
Azula was literally the definition of the menace
Am I the only one who had thing for azula?
Since this is a series focused on insane characters, can you by any chance have Eric Cartmen from South Park?
Daaaang Azula didn’t earn her rights to the round table? Is it because she’s a woman? 😂😂
I haven't even started the video yet I know its finna be good
Surely Yuno from Future diary is gonna be first ballot asylum attendee
The Tai lee one was just out of pocket home girl found her calling in life yet Azula just went "Screw your life purpose you're coming with me!" Edit: I'm sorry WHAT?? KIDNAPPING KIDS?! CAN SOMEONE ELABORATE?
Blud posted on my birthday
Do Junko Enoshima next!
Not the fire nation city girls 😭😭😔 btw I hope you do an episode on Midari from Kakegurui
Loving this series idea bro,opens up to a lot of new possibilities for ya to look at.
What you know bout being off them yerckies..🤔😎
😂😂😂😂😂god damn azula is more demonic when u make a video about her
Oh! A new series dedicated to some crazy mofo’s? Sounds great!  Also I know damn well we gonna get an episode on The Joker sooner or later, and buddy, that’s gonna be a long one.   That man lives and breathes "I’m gonna run Batman’s fade and ruin his fucking life" every day all day
Call me weird but as a kid I always found Azula cool as heck. Maybe thats why I just got some black af1s
Can't wait for the inevitable Yuno vid.😂
Waiting for Kerayu from redo to be here as well.
20:48 Azula: GET THAT ASS BANISH! PESANTS. CLEAN THE BODY 😡!!!!  14:08/22:53 Azula: YOU SHOULD KILL YOURSELF NOW!!!!!
Azula really just the hardest antagonist created hands down
aye CJ i just noticed Yusuke Urameshi isnt part of the round table.... are you going to add him?
Can you do the joker next
Azula is where my love for toxic women started 😂
That moment you realize TomTom is a 3 ninjas reference😮 and also if you dated her can you imagine. You would have anything that you wanted if someone started talking to you crazy, she would kill them sight 😂
azula committed anime taboo  she didnt let the main character transform like eren and super buu
Finally a new upload 😭😭
I take no pride being as attracted to her as I was when I was young. I also have no regrets. Also, didn't it just break your heart when she started crying all chained up and mad with power?🥺
“I’m about to celebrate becoming an ONLY CHILD!” (Said to Zuko as she planned to kill him) this was all the evidence I need
Already love this series! I can’t wait to see who patient #002 is gonna be!
Ryuga from beyblade should next
W VIIIID!!❤❤❤❤👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾😁😁
My guy when the bleach video coming
I always had a theory that the fire nation had access to the best stimulants in the world and the 3 girls while they were chasing them were absolutely sniffin that GAAAAAS if you know what i mean lol.
Azula had still has a choke hold me maaaaaaaaaaaan 😩
Naah Pause . Azula is 14 and took over ba sing se in a week while the fire nation been trying for Years. Azula in peak performance can only be beat by plot Armour. Iq -1000 , Fight-1000 , skill-1000
Azula gave me nightmares as a kid.  Esdeath deserves to be in the Asylum.
Na I can already tell the series gon be a banger
Looking back as an adult, Azula is a psychopath, but she's also a cool psychopath. The blue fire, lightning, and some of the unique firebending she did, Azula was too cool of a villain to hate.
I was hoping she’d eventually get better but nah she too far gone
If you ever did a Higurashi video I’d greatly watch & appreciate it.
Yuno Gasai most def getting an ep haha
Ngl I can for once in my life say wholeheartedly that I got better Risz than someone after what Azula said in this vid😂😂💀💀😭
Nah that skeyyy part kill me
You should do a video on Accelerator during the Sisters Arc and Battle Royale arc, he was fr insane, his development in the light novel is peak (not as good as Touma, the mc) but to give an example he shot off a Girl's jaw and said she'd give good head during the Battle Royale arc
Azula really was demonic.
I can fix her.
Ya know hidan gotta be up here
Good start to a good new scenes🖤
Azula: The ultimate hater
Azula was a baddie i can change her ong
Ngl Iroh is a unit. He has so much ''retired ultimate gangster'' energy
Azula is insanely dangerous, because once she calms down, she outsmarts everyone. The way she engineers her escape from the nuthouse is insane. And then she never gets caught unless she wants.
Finally the old microphone is back
Yep. That’s one part of my childhood that I can’t even try to forget.
CJ my man please Toji is next on the roundtable he's black Air Force energy
9:05 "Oh nah, my arch rival/my Vegeta/my Sasuke, just got washed in one second by his sister. I'm out this bitch." * eagle sound * That is pure perfection right there! I love that scene so much!!! 😅😅😅 Worth the wait.
😂😂😂😂 Azula the first patient ,,, it's fitting for her😂😂she was a war machine since she was her kid geez like she smoking on that psycho pack
New Cj series!? Truly peak
Dear god… Yoshikage Kira belongs in the Asylum, and the Round Table. Because dear LORD.
17:39 This alone had me weak
Bro you gotta make the Junko one ASAP!!!!!!
The Fire Nation City Girls 😂😂
Just in case you forget. Azula was 15 during the events of the show.
patient hayase from to your eternity when
I hope Crimson lands in this. his appearance in the first 4 episodes is already reason enough
Yooo higurashi was a brain f*ck among brain f*cks. The two people that ended up being behind all of it - CRAZY AZZ PEOPLE
Love the series idea!!
I had a crush on her 💀, i can still see why...
This is gonna be a dope series.kinda surprised azula is patient 001 but not a bad choice either.looking Forward to the rest of this series
We should get Kuveria next.....💪😻
I love this new series!!!!!!! Can’t wait for the next episode
You gotta do Yuno Gasai from Future Diary 😂 ain’t nobody topping her insanity
Was hoping CJ would do an Azula themed vid
Beach episode is top 2 but not 2 episode in ATLA. Chef’s kiss
ive been waiting
Not the Asylum 😂
Azula is build different
Make a video about Mash burnedead From mashle magic and muscles
i can fix her
This new series is great
u know whats crazy? a man lika her father would actually be a good match for her,one who dominates her and one whos much stronger than her
The level of editing has really improved and the talking actually matches the mouth movement
I don't know if The Major from Hellaing Ultimate belongs on this list or on the roundtable but he is a straight up menace...Alucard is definitely on the roundtable though 😂
Nah fam since this about crackheads then next vid should be about hisoka or dio
I wonder makima will be here
My favorite monthly YouTuber
Finally Cj is back 💯💯
New vid Yessir
Shego need to be next I need it
That yoshikagke kira video is gonna go crazy. Cuz this episode was so gass. Azula need fire and lighting restraints
Joker’s psycho lookin ass probably broke that chart with no effort 💀
The guy who sounds like Muscle Man sounds like Kuwabara and it's great!😂😂😂
"I can fix her"
Yo cj this is great🎉🔥 almost like that video you did on ALUCARD!
Azula is too strong
Fire nation city girls is valid
17:06 Nah the Polar Express is wild 😭
Can't wait for Hisoka lol
Dude you are fucking awesome. But when will we get Balalaika???
still waiting for the Ainz video to this day
This begs the question-- do you think there are any characters at the roundtable who need to spend some time at the asylum? :O
Bro I’ve been waiting for a new cj vid for what feels like 2 years
Y’all don’t understand when I say SHE IS A BADDIE 😩😩
Kinda wanna see shredder from TMNT
This all a part of Aizens plan to get a black airforce video
Thank you for this video
I love this series just from it’s pilot and can’t wait to see the maniacs in here
Azula really having a whole Green Goblin moment with her mom in that mirror
Ngl I thought azula was hot as hell when I was a kid and I blame women like her for obsession with crazy bitches that would kill me
Azula is the personification of Girlboss, Gaslight, Gatekeep... Is Ty Lee's case the gaslighting was literal and metaphorical
and this my friends was why ty lee was bae as a kid lmaoo. azula was just a MANIAC
Imma need a double upload
Nice musical choice
3:59  This wasn't a death stare/ This was Azula looking at the captain like a disappointed mother.  Adding on to her screaming internally saying "YOU BITCH!!"
Azula is the baddest girl in avatar the last air bender no matter how crazy she is
"Entertain me BITCH!" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Azula did tai Li so DIRTY😂 I been wanting to hear someone talk about this for years.
Yo im almost scared to watch more of this series
Hey, can I get N-word pass, if I find another candidat to insane asylum? :) Asking for a friend
I’m just asking can you’re able to post on my birthday on November 11th for Attack on titan final season final part! plz🥺🥺
Iroh on Packwatch 😢😢😢😢
:) hahah nice one
Why Ozai sound like Uncle Ruckus
Finally my manz Cj back at again wit greatness and halarious vids 🤣🔥
Yeah, Azula was fuckin C R A C K E D. If I may suggest a character, he definitely won’t get to #4 or 5 maybe not even 3. but the dude was… crazy to say the least. Kuradeel from SAO.
Finally a new video
LETS FUCKING GOOO. Been asking for this for a good time.
POST MORE VIDEOS PLS
i mean like just this one chick complete the whole series man.... keep it up CJ
Would.
Azula needs a therapist for that therapist for the abuse and psychological torment
Dawg, it's crazy, I was just checking for you last night before I went to bed thinking "Damn, where's the O.G at?" AND I WAKE UP TO THIS!  Goated
NEW VIDEOOOO!!!!!
HOMELANDER NEEDS TO GE ON THIS LIST YO CJ TUNE INN
Pls do killua for black Air Force energy
I remember a while ago CJ posted on Twitter saying that he wanted to know if there were any characters outside of anime that he should do a video on, and I said Azula, love to see how it turned out
13:57 That's why you don't use you ult in the open
The code music is crazyyyyy
That ship line hurt me on a personal level 😂
Bro you should cover Diavolo
The king has returned!!!  *Reads title* oh this is gonna be fun 😈
Azula was my favourite villain,I wash they had here Legend of Korra for a flashback
I could heal her 🤧
The one day I decided to check this man's channel, he uploads. Cj you never fail me🔥
Damm. If you covered azula in the comix the insanity meter would skyrocket to level 7 atleast
Well, we know where Asylum is going...and that's Light Yagami.
CJ BCK
Fun fact because she wasn’t fighting properly. Her fighting style and hand movement were extremely fucked up.
Reminder that Azula was 14 years old
Make more of these
WWWWWWWWW
Bro this vid is 🔥  but where the hell is Vegetas video at, why he at the round table. Imma need you to get on that
When zuko ran through that door and fell all I heard in my head was Goofy’s yell 😂😂😂
Team Azula forever
Mama told me about girls like you. I was hoping she was right
bro everytime i got go to work and see a new video upload from cj I know that day aint gonna be as bad!
The mc of redo of healer can be the leader of this table
Bro love ur content but respectfully your allergic to posting😂
I get upset every time I have to remember that the Earth kingdom's black ops betrayed their own kingdom to work for the enemy just because. It would've been so easy for them to do spin the Block on her
And when the world needed him most, he returned
Watching Azula being cunning and calculated to having a mental breakdown, was wild. When I saw her crying, I kind of felt bad for her. Her father treated her like a tool instead of caring her. Her mother just left. All that had a big effect on her. I freaking love Azula and she was written so well. Also, I love this new change of pace. I can't wait to see who's next to the asylum.
We like our crazy women but that’s a little too much
Her flames are fucking blue wtf shawty on.
Nigga said fire nation city girls im weak😂😂💀
17:05 holly fuck that shit sent me🤣🤣🤣
My type of women ❤
14:20 The show shows up in multiple anime news articles and magazines so it's anime
There is no drill in Ba Sing Se.
Does the roundtable own the asylum?
13:55 the deadly alliance
God may help, because junko FUCKING enoshima comes, shit gonna go down ass heinous LMFAO
If she ain’t as crazy as azula I don’t want her
But anyway Here me out....
I can fix her 😩
Her craziness gets even more crazy in the comics. 😅
Do Vaas next
The fire bending with the Fire Force sound effect goes hard af😮
Yooo leave my wifey alone lol
Please do more of this series
Lacienega from proud family is no different. 😂😂😂
dofy?
Mind you Azula is legit only like 14 in the series and she this crazy wtf
Um, CJ What the F*** is happening?
Bro if she wasn't at least in yo top 5 of childhood crushes, you're not a real man
Finally !!! Someone talks about the absolute menace that’s Azula, that b**tch was crazy for real 😂😂😂🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻
We need a new season of Avatar atleast one about Azula only .
Haven’t even started the video yet and I’m laughing 😂
lol she insane
“ Off a peeeeeserrrrrrrccccccc “🤣🤣🤣
I Haven't watched a single second of this video but based on the title I KNOW it's about to be a banger!
THE GOAT FINALLY POSTED
16:40 This is actually the first time I've seen you put the actual scene of a movie without voiceovers in your vids
Iroh is the real combat goat of the series so to have him actually having to step in and throw her away, shows that azula is a menace
Can't wait for the video about Joker and Kira Yoshikage
Azula is the mother of the, "hater grindset." She is the most, "born to hate"  character ever made.
Upload the same video audio for why she deserves her spot on the table
Damm CJ a month nigga a month 😂😂 video was fire tho  🔥 🔥🔥🔥
CJ better be consistent with the asylum cuz who knows, they might rival the round table
I like it
1:01 who tf is that
After reading the books, she passed 5 light years ago.
First Pickle now Azula. Lot of special cases showin up. But it’s good to know the Hall of Black Airforce Activity has a psych ward AND a super max prison
orochumaru next please
a new spin from the badass side! i love this
love this new series man keep up the good work!!!
Goddamn i forgot how batshit fuckin crazy Azula is
DO GRIFFITH NEXT!
Azula was the baddest
Great video Cj Da Champ. Captured her crazy perfectly lol. I like the concept of the series and boy there is a lot of nut jobs
Yk it’s good when cj posts
Azula had some of the coolest and craziest moves too, she was an actual beast in battle
I can lowkey fix azula fr tho
Your videos are the best
LETS GO CJ UPDATED THIS MAN CANT BE CHAINED EVEN AFTER 1 MONTH PER VID
So is Griffith gon be here? 🤠
Hey CJ will you ever lock anyone from Dorohedoro up? Sure as hell are crazy anoth
We need one on anna from shimoneta and the queen of yanderes herself, yuno gasai from future dairy
Ok Dr. CJ Strange
You should definitely do reverse flash
Great new series idea
Second video has to be joker
azula is the reason why the word toxic exist
We can go ahead and add Eren
Azula is insane a hater and worst of all she hurt iroh and aang
anyone else ever notice azula looks completely different without makeup? 15:11
Patient no'2 must be the crazy woman from to your eternity
Gonna need a bigger asylum fast
Finally
love the new series!
Eren watched her fry Aang mid-transformation and was like 'Imma copy that.'
Bro i hope Dj does an jjk special video, after the second season ends
ayo you can't talk bout insanity without talking bout the joker
this series is gonna be so goddamn good, i'm hoping for Orochimaru or Kabuto to make it on here possibly
Aye Cj you started a whole new video trend/format my Boi congrats
She attacked the MC while he was transforming. Only true crazy people can do that.
Is mayonnaise insanity? Okay but seriously, can we get a Patrick asylum video for April fools?
i’m happy to see danganronpa on cj’s channel ngl i didn’t think he was cultured.
Her rizz was so bad that CJ HIMSELF appeared just to disapprove.
You got me when you played Thomas the tank engine music when azula is chasing aang after omashu
Sealed ground?…good taste.
um cj what the FUCK is goin on
Edits be one point 🔥
I can change her
I almost choked on my breakfast watching this video 😂😂. Bro brought a whole new perspective to Azula's craziness 😂
Samurai jack next
Azula was basically if Cletus Kassidy from Spiderman isekai’d into anime and got pyrokinesis and committing literal arson and had no problem at all and with the personality of a Karen
Name one person that haven’t watch last air bender
More videos
Ngl Azula had 9 year old me in an absolute choke hold
If Azula ever gets out the Asylum, we know there's a Black Air Force invite waiting for her
Patient 001 gotta stay in there for life she broke the fuckin’ meter in comics… AZULA NEEDS TO DO LIFEz IN THE ASYLUM
RAHHHHHH IK ITS BOUNCY  14:24
she tried drilling into the walls in aot
Another goated piece of CJ waffle content
brother i can not wait for the junko episode that woman is just insane
Kazutora
bro azula should be lvl 6 bruh
I already know this gonna be a great series
BOUT MF TIME AZULA FINE ASS CRAZY ASS GOT ON HERE   Plus gotta new hall for the crazy’s I see u Cj yes sir
Finally the goat cj is back
Another Banger Video, i lost when you showed aang with hair
i got so hyped to hear otherworld play in the back ground one of my favorite video game theme songs
Great video CJ! Can't wait to see more patients of the Asylum.
this shit was so good i unsubscribed and then subscribed again
Considering how the west be moving when it comes to female characters, we are never gonna get another bad bitch like this, praise Azula. Imagine Azula as a full adult, GOD DAMN!
You gotta do Junko Enoshima next. She takes psychotic to another degree.
The link to your second channel is broken, king.  Keep up the stellar content though
I like this can't wait til you get to hisuka and joker 💯
Please do a video on the ant king in Hunter x Hunter he has to be in that table
Excellent video honestly a solid idea I can't wait for the next one between this and the round table I've got solid rewatch content for ages thanks for helping me through my work day you da champ
This man can’t miss with his videos 😂😂😂😂😂
Naaaaah, she is a definition of mommy issues💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀.
Day 3 of asking cj to make a mecha sonic video from smbz (super Mario bros z). Im telling you he's really like that.
You know a bitch is crazy when she sends her files to join the round table of menaces but rather than joining as she thought the owner builds an Asylum and starts a whole damn new series just to make sure this other type of menaces are locked up
Nice
Please, Please, Please PLEASE DO MIDORI FROM KAKEGURUI!!!!!
Yo this was great. Wanna see more of this series.
This is such a great concept bro. I definitely enjoy the black air force series but this is a really nice change in scenery and still gives out the great commentary like CJ usually does. Keep it up bro💯💯💯💯
Tai Lee is literally one of the strongest characters in the series and isn't a bender nor does she seem to be tryingtoo hard lmao.
I can fix her
The asylum is gonna be fucked😂😂😂
22:53 he said "he instead of "she"
Azula didn't even HAVE to conquer Ba Sing Sai, she was just in the neighborhood, and was like, "Eh, I'm in the area, might as well do something while I'm here."
She was 14 dawg... Do you know how mad that is
Yo son, the muscle man section took me tf out 😂😂
Y'all trust i cant fix her
What is the ost starting at 22:17 ?
This show is so well written! The contrasting development of Azula and Zuko is nearly poetry.   Her at the end of the series felt so visceral for what was supposed to be a children's show.
What song was playing on the venom meme lol?
Am I the only one that wants junko next 😂😂
Bro the books are way worse she comes from 1 to 100 to 40 that bi is insane
Glad to see you again Cj hope your doing ok. I was waiting for what were you cooking for the past month.
NAH BLUD PULLED OUT THE FACECAM that how you know it was an L rizz take
i can fix her
you should do a vid on reverse flash
10year old me was crushing hard on that baddy
CJ I hope you're considering making another Air Force video in the future now that Tokyo Revengers season 2 and 3 are out, to this day it's the most funniest and accurate reation to the series.
12:45 ‘Big Azula’ sends me flying 🤣🤣🤣🤣 14:20 broooo she messed Aang up so bad he had hair when he woke uppp
Fr, 90's-2000's really was the era of crazy hot chicks and milfs 😅 That must have been some conspiracy, they really wanted us to fall for that type as teens or early adults... "But we ready to heal now" 😂
Jason todd/joker for 69
(Candy Girl) "I'm lookin' Mrs. Bubblegum. I'm Mr. Chic-O-Stik. I wanna dun nah nah. OHH, cause you so THICK!!"
Waiting for sweetooths trial
bro do light yagami next
The fact that Gojo aint here and on the round table is brazy
Loving this new series of yours, keep it up!  For the next episode, I nominated Yuno gasai, or Jan valentine from Hellsing ultimate, maybe the joker (from the killing joke).
Man im still here waiting for your eternity season 2 video
CJ DACHAMP do tokyo revengers s2 plssss
OH buddy, just wait till this man does Hayase from To your Eternity.
Avatar one of my favorite shows as a kid and still is now, W video
I see what mans is doing there's alot of mental breakdowns in the anime verse😂😂
Perfect start to a new series, can't wait for the next one!
9:26 this shit will never not make me laugh 😂
Damn I've been waiting for dis thanks CJ✌🏿
I see now. The man's main occupation is judge of some of the nastiest mofos known to humanity. Now we find out that he's a part time warden in a mental asylum. Makes sense.
Love the new series i wanna see more so bad
Great video as always, you should definitely do savage and maul for ths asylum series
"Team Azula" I lost it😂😂😂🤔
NGL I CAN FIX HER
me watching jjbz and i found the most brutal fighter in anime, in part six, he fight to solo
so we got the Black Air Force (Goated as series) and now the 'Bitches be crazy" series... bet! all thats left is Hall of Fame
Man azula is a menace she a lost cause since she was a toddler like girl firebend on her teacher's ass just because she got suspended and ozai out here suppoting her daughter nah father is a menace but she she a demon
COD 3 zom music uhh makes me feel things
I love this new series
just as an option, sanity meter can be diagnosis 🙂
do the joker next for patient 002
Thanks Cj to share some of the music you used it, but I'll still try to make the complete version.

HES BACK FINALLY
Azula's super team wouldve won 10 straight titles😂😂
man can't wait for him to do a yhwach video
And people still think this b#tch deserves a redemption.
yup, fux wit this series fasho💯🔥🫡
when yuno gasai gets added to the asylum we will be there
I already love this new series
Yosikage kira is gonna be high in the insanity meter , but I but I've we ever get Grifith , that shit is gonna need some more levels
I can fix her
Bro if ur doing cartoons we need to see tai lung run fades
I love how you sat down one day and asked yourself "Who belongs in a asylum?" Then the first person to enter your head was Azula 😂
YOOOO CJ WHERE IS ASHURA KENGAN?????
That was smooth with the cod music
You gotta add mahito after this jjk season is over brooo. He is downright crazy
Yessir another w cjdachamp yearly upload
Griffith episode when?
Can we all agree that Griffith should be locked up here without even doing one of these videos. Disrespectful, yes... But that man definitely had a psycho side if he ended up making a contract with demons. Besides, as CJ said in the past... there is one moment he refuses to look at because "That shit's forbidden!"
I’m a sucker for azula
Loved this.
Azula is a strong of start
Starting a new series off strong
21:30 is that Miranda Sings☠
AZULA is level 6 fr
Series gone be fye bro✊🏾🔥
Great day when CJ uploads
It makes me realise Frank Castle a.k.a. the punisher who is right about this.
Iroh deserves the roundtable, man was THAT GUY😂😂😂
1:11 Azula is Patient 0 since she is the one who started the asylum
15:11 had me dying lmao
These are absolutely beautiful
Azula
3
CJ forgot to mention that she killed her mother 💀 (correct me if I am wrong)
You gotta look into the kengan matches for this series: they have a mf who's brain releases endorphins instead of pain when he's injured, dude got his dick broken and then got killed by poking into his eyes until his brain was reached, and bro was crying laughing during all of that. And that's just a random side character they have a yandere that killed a guy because *he* got his ass beat and a little spray of blood got on the MC's shirt.
I WAS WAITING FOR HIM TO DO AZULA
The Asylum 😂 I love it.
Azula was a national terrorist at 14 she was a freaking demon
She out here movin like a cod zombie 😂😂
DJ Where The Hell Is The Doffy Vid I've Been Waiting For 5 Months
We give Eren props for wailing on the Warhammer Titan mid-transformation, but everyone seems to sleep on Azula grieving Aang as he was charging up the Avatar state.
When are we getting a Majin Vegeta video
YEEEEEESSSSS THE GOAT BACK WITH ANOTHER 1!!! HUZZAH
Man needs to do Cobra Commander from GI JOE Resolute next.
CJ where in the Oompa Loompa world were you?
I can fix her
This was well deserved. Azusa is absolutely off her damn rocker.
it’s a great when u upload, let me get my sister😂😂
Cj… WHERE THE FUCK IS THE TOJI VIDEO?!?!?!
Do Candice from Phineas and Ferb
Please do junko next that girl was genuinely crazy
I have a idea. Could you do a Geralt black air force video?
Yup azula bat shit crazy fo sure
CJ i think i have new contestnt that litrally deserves to be in the round table and that is  SHOTA AIZAWA  litrally from season 1 till now you could sense the black airforce by a fucking mile
Dude u gotta be a Taurus cuz I jus went to my subs and like wea my boy been at 😂
this was worth waiting for
Nice
She was only 14 years old😅a menace from Birth.
I'm blaming Azula for my taste in women
I love your channel 😂😂😂😂
Finally 😭🙏🏻
This was a change of pace and it was fire too. Azula is a bad bitch no cap. She's crazy asf but she's valid. W vid and good to see you posting again 💪💯
this has got to be, the strongest way possible you could have started this series.
The Asylum of Black Air Force Activity...I love it😂😂😂😂😂😂
I can't wait for the rest of the series
New series! W video as always and can't wait for an episode of Joker if you have plans for it.
She the type of girl that u don't stick ur thing into crazy girl it be good but backfire on ur ass trust me
Can't let any of these societal threats loose.
Azula so badass she deserves to be in the round table of menaces😅
WELL WELL WELL LOOK WHAT WE GOT HERE A CJ DACHAMP VIDEO AFTER 1 MONTH THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE 😤😤😡😡
where is the asylum intro and ending from
Love the Asylum can't wait for the next one especially the Joker and Anna Nishikinomiya. I have one question. When are you inducting Shadow from Eminence in Shadow into the Round Table
Such a good start for holloween, good vid Cj
Azula so bad😪😪
14:07 Damn, I can already imagine little Katakuri back in the days sitting in front of this show taking notes like "yeah, finally someone did it, fuck their powerups, can't wait for the day when I'll try something like that with my own main character"
She that one friend on Minecraft that bans they homies when they find diamonds
I love this new category of the Asylum. Leaves a lot of room for SCP jokes ngl
What a way to wake up 😢😢
I read a comic abt their mom and their giga quest to find her and azula was needed for that and she kinda wanted to kill em a few dozen times
The translation ruined the peak quotes ngl
Yo I really need to know cause it’s been bothering me for years! Where is the sound effect at 20:31 from????
So if we ever get a Young Gasai video it'll probably be one of those  Now that ur running crazy bitches and all.
Eren Yeager got to do guys actually crazy especially that last season and movie where he the giant titan shiii wild
Bummed that Aang never got at Asuka for that cheap shot
Remember she’s 14
guys I swear I can fix her
Bro after the pickle video people gave so many suggestions because how hype things were rn  Yujiro vs baki  The jjk jumpings  Some of the new stuff coming out  Yuji vs the blood guy   This monkey chose avatar
Junko better be next I stg
*coochiebandit445* iykyk 💀💀
YAAAASSSSS  HE FINALLY MADE THE VIDEO 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Ok I know this gonna sound wack but.......... I can fix her
Azula really is a good intro to this series. I am....now terrified for whoever will be brought in next.
CJs videos getting funnier each time
The real question is where is my doflamingo video
Oh shit a new upload!
W vid fr
Brooo I was literally thinking why Azula hadn't gotten a video 2 days ago or even a case for the round table. Glad CJ was cookin this up.
So... Fiodor is next right?
whaeres pickle
He's back
CJ BRO diavolo/doppio gotta be on here  edit: mahito from jjk too, that dude is out of his damn mind
You know she is far gone when not even single comment is "I can fix her".
Yo CJ love your videos, they always make me laugh and I think you should check out (what I think) the most edgy mc ever: Shadow from The eminence in Shadow. I mean got damn I know we are in season two and he hasn’t done much to be edgy but season 1, this dude was so edgy that he said “I maybe running but you ain’t cooking for shit!”
Game is Game
Bro this is the best Video what you made because taht was Asylum video and she was in a Asylum 😳
239790th
Remember Guy Azula is a 14 years old
@17:44 This man starts playing "Sin" From FFX! That's how you know you're dealing with someone who is criminally insane!
I won't lie,I'd still share a bed with Azula even if I get third-degree burns
21:37 "Azula didn't i teach you to say no to drugs" 😂😂😂
CJ the champ I have been subscribed for you to you like I want to see like 2 years
Her introduction is easily one of the best in all series, do the tides command this ship???😅😅😅
YESSSS
welp can't wait to see if Satoko Hojo from Higurashi Gou and Sotsu enter's this list cause dang even if i'm dumb I'm smart enough to not violate my friends so hard cause I can't be with them cause that's just how life is, her doing it just to have her be in the same village just literal destroys everything the show stand for and the likes.
I'm glad Azula is the first case, she is That Girl
19:10 oh, and that's not even THE WORST thing she did as a kid. She TOLD her brother that their grandpa (or father, forgot which) was gonna get rid of him for being such a failure. She implied Zuko was gonna get killed or exiled by his own family, and I'm leaning towards KILLED
honey wake up new cj video
This is a wild video 💯
I'm going to be disappointed if Satoko from Higurashi doesn't make it to The Asylum, she's a level 5 alright iykyk 🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪  Ya'll think Azula is crazy?! Satoko is a menace on a meta temporal scale LOL
"Do the tides command this ship?" 😂😂
Katara: Final Girl Azula: Insane Horror Villain
My goattttt dropping a video on Azula. We eatinnnnnn
commenting for the algo, love the news series idea, happy early halloween and all that, much love
I’d like to summit a new man for the round table The Tojo Fushigoro I know this isn’t a round table video but I gotta summit my man
I got used to this already.
I could fix her, but whatever the fuck is wrong with her is honestly way hotter
Great idea and great edits as always.
As the head attendant of the Roundtable of Black Airforce Energy… me and the other senior members all now have to work double-time to keep this place operating. I’m actually glad they’re all behind bars this time. And yes, we did move Pickle to this place too. Oh, and we also have to partner up with a member for every shift; their energy is the only thing keeping us alive. We had hoped to get Adam Smasher as full-time security, but he’s still waiting on his seat. Honestly, I’d rather just be Buu’s manager than have Azula staring me down.
This just makes me wonder why iroh isn't on the roundtable
Imma keep it real with you Cj... I can fix her 🤷‍♂️
Haven't even started the video fully and I'm hook all because of outlast ima rock heavy with this series
Aint nobody Able to fix that girl
besides the crazy... Azula kinda bad though...........
But CJ, Yoshikage Kiira just wants to live a normal life 🤪
We can see Angs wind attacks but they can’t that’s always cool to think about
I swear if vaatu possessed her instead of unalaq, The series would be done.
Dude I would love to shake your hand bro, you truly outdid yourself at this one! Love bro
Bro gotta throw Light Yagami in there. I've never rooted against a protagonist so hard in my life
MAKE A TOJI VIDEO
Why the hell ain't Azula on the Menace round table fr??? Yes she Targerian level crazy but just like them dragon nigga she dangerous, ruthless and powerful af! She would make Madara misogynistic ah PROUD
His Ozai voice sounded exactly like Uncle Ruckus 😂
When they tell the fire nation to pull up skeeyee 😂
Azula such a menace she pulled up on her brother to kill him with a smile on her face
Love the video and i am fuggin HERE for the Asylum series my guy! Keep doin you and we gone keep watchin!
Toji needs to be investigated for a potential invitation to the table. Or the asylum. He could go in either. Let's be real.
When I was younger Azula was bad fr fr
I can fix her
Was I the only who fell in love with azula as a kid or was I just crazy?😅
That rizz was so bad Cj. Like dayum
And they thought only Eren was capable, little did they know…
Behold Ozai's Angels
Azula is like a witch demon tyrant. Mabey the next video can be about bondrewd from made in abyss
4:50 both figuratively and literally, by setting the safety net on fire, and you KNOW that net had to be doused in some kind of oil to lit up so quickly
The fact that Zuko never forgot why he was where he was made me respect his character so much more
The way cj ended that shit off was so clean😭🤌🏽
This was so fucking good. Fucking hilarious. All the words I couldn't say as a kid (or to be fair, as an adult) flowed through. Good shit.
Azula my type of woman
Lock her ass tf up fr
I love how when he talks about the menaces at the round table, the first picture that comes is kid buu 😂  But now I'm glad CJ has made a series dedicated to people with insanity levels nearly the same as the joker
Oh dude theres a good few mfs to add here and cj please keep an eye out for my comments im a huge fan of crazy miggas
I can fix her
I know you probably won't cover her but Lotara Sarrin would probably be a level 10 B****.
Great upload as usual though I gotta say the sound effects of the old series are on another level.
Nigga where you’ve been at ???so many things have happened since then hear 5 so much black aite force moments  in own piece alone, eminence in shadow , JJK in general 😭😭😭😭😭many round table members could’ve been added
***Damn poor girl but at the same time stay in there please you deserve it, also next one should be kira or the joker maybe a villan from mha like twice or shigaraki those would be cool to see***  **(Also thanks for coming back cj another W video you champ)**
Ah yes, ain't no better horror story to tell as halloween approaches than that of this menace
The man himself is back with another one. And this time a mf so cold she had everybody pressed. Man. Know what? fuck it, Azula is *HIM*  “And she put this man Aang in a *pack.* Had this lil nigga in a coma. When the nigga woke up, he had HAIR.” God damn it bruh. I can’t stop laughing at the shit in this video. Cj really is the champ
I still don't understand why he hasn't done a video on Cid from Eminence in Shadow. He is ridiculous in power and actions I believe he deserves a video.
My 5th grader ass was like: "I can fix her"
As someone who hasn’t watched ATLA and who’s like a minute into this vid, the concept of a character in a Cj vid being put into an ASYLUM instead of the table, when HALF THE N*GGAS ON THE TABLE ALREADY EXIST scares me
Can u please add light yagmai to the round table death note still peak. And in the crazy list
Ya have just such a good and natural flow to story telling in a funny ass and also actually informative way about what ya talkin about, makes ya easy to listen to in the background, banger vid.
Not gonna lie... I can fix her
Video Idea:  Top worst females of Anime, I want to hear you shit on Amber from invincible
bro be flaming her forever
gigan rocks! sonic zero grvity trck
You still owe us some Tokyo revengers videos
Not gunna lie...azula was my childhood crush😅🤣 but the way she tried to "flirt" with Chad had me dying☠️☠️
Please add Black Dynamite to the round table of black air forces
Sometimes I feel like not watching CJ's vids for a year to get 8 vids to binge watch.
Patient 2: yukki yukki yuuuuuuuuukiiiiii
Really bringing back that first outlast trauma with that intro
👀 aye yo "Get on your knees and start glazing me" is wild 😂 😂
lowkey waitin for the funny hero hunter Garou to either be in the roundtable, Or the asylum.
Bro thinks its ok to be gone for 2 months and then drop a banger of a video
If we bringing in Avatar characters then I recommend a video on Kuvira. She really went from Background Security Guard #923657 to Avatar Hitler in the span of one season! She legit invented the Avatar world's first nukes!
I have many predictions on who's going to the Asylum next.
Ha! Thanks for this, CJ! I was always hoping you'd do Azula! ... That came out wrong.
Finally!!!!
welp see y’all next month
I need an asylum vid for Yuri from Future Diary ASAP PLZ
Let's get it 🗿😎
AND SHE WAS 14! FOUR TEEN
Can't wait for Yoshikage Kira and others. Nice of CJ to make a new series
the once a month warrior strikes again
When you said commence rehabilitation  I was expecting the velvet room theme from the persona series (persona 5 version) 😅😅😅
Only if the comics made episodes bro she was a pure demon at the end Iove it it also she gets away because bro got played again 🤦🏾‍♂️but as a lil brother I understand 🤣🤣 I’ll never trust my sister
I can fix her tbh
Could’ve gotten to level 7+ with the novels
I CAN FIX HER
I loved this episode! It's perfect dude!
You should do more avatar content 👍
She really is the personification of: bash shit crazy
WOULD!
I would have married Azula. She needs love.😅  For her to control lightning in that state of mind is crazy 👌🏾
Ngl im horny for azula
It is an honor to be a part of this on the first day 😎😎
Seeing all this shit makes me think that a 2-D Fighter with ATLA would be nuts.
Azula been in my search history for awhile
ayo we gonna get some yanderes eventually? owo
Did he say braai???😂😂 Big up for the S.Africa reference
Yo u should do a meet of de demon kings kinda like an exhibit but a meet to decide who’s de better demon king or u just don’t do dat
Can we talk about the lip synching here at 2:58? Man's leveled up his editing skills. 👌👌
Blessings on blessings
Not only did Zuko eat that lightning he also managed to still redirect it while damn near dead
Make a video about the lich from adventure time
You haven't read the Comics!? They're pretty good. The reason why Zuko is visiting Azula is because he's looking for their Mother. Very awesome Adventure. We learned about Toph's Metalbending Academy, The origin of Republic City, and Katara & Sokka coming to terms with their Father remarrying.
Been waiting on a Cj drop for a minute 🎉
I'm just waiting fot the satoko(Higurashi) video
Who else will be joining azula in the insane asylum
Finally
I thought Azusa was tryna get on the round table 😂😂😂
A series about crazy and u started with a woman...man u really do know how to make enemies
After the Black Airforce round table, that new Asylum serie is pure genius! One of my recommandation for the Asylum would be Yuno Gasai from Mirrai Nikki. Probably one of the craziest character I ever see. All of that just for a poor dude D...
Aint Gonna lie i only read the comic up to when she escaped wh they looked for her mom. I didnt even know they caught her and had her in a straight jacket
e
What was the music used at the end of the video? It sounds awfully familiar and I can’t remember 24:03
If crazy, why hot tho?
I gotta continue watching Avatar bruuu
Women crush everyday= Azula 😮‍💨
Man you know it’s a good night when can uploads
DO HISOKA HXH
W video Cj sum characters that should be admitted to the Asylum next is either Bill Cipher, Joker, Light, or Yuno Gasai
Bro u gotta post more fr fr your channel be to lit not to!!! 🤦🏾‍♂️💯💯
Azula has never once been beaten in a straight one on one, every time she's gotten sneaked before a win.
14:26 😂
😂
Genuinely having trouble thinking of people as crazy as her fr.
The fact that she IS only 14 years old Too…but lets be honest we all probably had a childhood crush of Azula or smth
I was here for the first ever episode
LOL Thanks Youtube algorithm for this channel.
Azula is what every man fears when someone say it’s ok to put your Twix in a crazy chick😂
I feel like a few members from the black air force energy round table could possibly qualify for this series too easy example kid buu😂😂😂 and i got plenty more besides him
16:33 bro, azula has the most terrible rizz i have ever seen in a day of my life.
Azula watched as her brother got his face burned off, by daddy dearest.😓  That still unsettles me as adult, because it confirms early on that there IS something really f*cking wrong with her.😳😰
I was wondering when you'd get to Azula and you did NOT disappoint!
We all know Orochimaru is next.
Junko vid
Nigga still doing once a month bro you’re vids me helpful asf when tryna see sumn funny
Bro, I missed you so much! Welcome back!
Welp, its only a matter of time until we see the Joker on here.
She is the definition of demon timing.
Ngl, iroh is the MVP in this entire show
danganronpa cast should go there
Nonce-con 2021 himself, Hisoka
Yooooooo I'M SO DOWN FOR THIS IF HIGURASHI  GETTING THEY SHITS IN LETS GOOOO
Acnologia needs to have an exhibit check
I fucking died with the polar express
5:12 😂
She still crazy in the comics
:D
Damn, I have never seen such carnage before
the fact that you took the time to analyze azula for the asylum is amazing!
WAKE UP BABE CJ POSTED
W
And someone will still smash. Kek
ah, so we now go into the insane. I wonder if we have the gray shoes or sketches. The people who are usually good but when you touch something they care about. All hell lets loose and they give out a good ol rousing round of divine judgement to the evil. something along those lines. Keep on keeping on my guy!
i remember i had such a crush on her when i was a kid
I'm surprised you didnt get into the comics
Still perfect wife material tho
Cjs Ozai impression dead ass sounds  like Uncle Ruckus
Btw atla is an anime
I nominate psycho mantis.
I know I was about to be a lit series
Eren and azula related fr 14:00
If Azula is patient #1, we know damn well the Joker is patient 0 that dude built the foundation for this whole organization
A new series from CJ Dachamp  LETS DO IT !🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
.
I Always instantly like your videos because I know they’re about to be good either😂
Cjjjjjjjj 💪🏾💪🏾
Can you do the father and son fight Baki hammah
Damn this a kid show?
Yuichi Katagiri deserves a segment
Yuno Gasai (MIRAI NIKKI) will probably *break into* the BLACK AIR FORCE Round Table to get her sneakers.
She crazy and Dark side
LET'S GOOOO!! New series!! I can't wait for the next one!
Friendly reminder that she did all this as a 14-15 year old  this was basically a “what if” scenario where the super rich high school freshman girl who gets everything also has fucking superpowers   Oh and she has an IQ of 1000000
We makin it out of the avatar cycle with this one fr 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
Doffy next
Ayyy I knew this was coming
When Being daddies little girl leaves you more mentally unstable than a crackhead having a coming to Jesus moment.
Fart
Azula is a gyat even 14
Glad to see a new video from you. I can't wait to see who else, other than the obvious Clown, gets a comfy straight jacket 😅
Aang with waves is crazy 😂😂😂😂
Also kinda glad he didn't start off with joker. To which everyone knows he's #000 subverted expectations
Dead and Cooked😂
Nah cant forget when she pulled up to the air temple and told suko she was about to become an only child. Proceeded to get thrown into the abyss but used fire bending to glide onto the mountain and joined up.
WE MAKING IT TO THE YT RECOMMENDATIONS WITH THIS ONE
Patient 002 best be ZeroTwo leading up to her break down
I imagine Dabi from MHA might be joining his female variant in this Asylum.
CJ USING THE LEGENDS GIRINTINA THEME LETS GOO
What’s the song aang with hair listening to? Sounds familiar but can’t put a finger on it
Damn it I've been waiting for the GOAT TO COME BACK!!!!
Azula learned from Eren fr fr
bro forgot to add his discord
welcome back champ and cant wait to see what harley quinn gets
My favourite part is when you just call Long Fei a bum
Not going to lie I used to have a crush on azula still do I don't know if it's just that I have a thing for crazy women or what but yeah I'm not going to lie even though she's bad shit crazy wants to burn the world I probably go along with it just to hit that booty though
Fire Nation City Girls 😂😂😂😂💀
I am fucking diying 😂
Ooo does this mean we'll get videos twice as often since we have 2 distinct groups now that need filling
Someone i see in level 5 is gilles from fate that guy was literally making a whole cities children population sink just because he wanted to play with them both mentally and physically while his partner was making them into art pieces it was so mad that a conqueror felt sick from the sight of what was left from the children after he was done and his backstory flashbacks in the fgo manga is even more sick
fuck everything else. i found homie 3 days ago already and alr watched all his videos and always waiting on the next one.
Bruh this if fire 🔥 I can’t wait for the next episode 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
CJ We need Griffith in the Asylum Pwease
Azula in the beach episode is why i have a fucked up taste in women.
🔥🔥🔥🔥..........Ao my nigga is back........🔥🔥🔥🔥
Azula is a tragic character.  Her father made her a weapon and had no other purpose for her, he leveraged his approval to mold her into his perfect executor.  She does everything the way she thinks he’d want things done and wins the war for him… and her reward is nothing but a meaningless title while her father alone goes to claim the world.  She thought she was the favorite child and then realized she’s no different than Zuko.  Ozai never cared for either of them, but Azula was useful to him.  Everything Azula ever did… was for nothing.  The only person she wanted approval from never saw her as anything but a tool he was ready to put back on the shelf.
Carnage is also a good choice for this series
Is the Asylum underneath the new building of the round table?
danm i wonder if all the cj copycat gon start they own asylum videos now 😂😂😂
The hardest outro
12:55 out of context is insane. Actually, in context is insane too 🤨
DAY 10 OF ASKING CJ TO MAKE A BLACK AIR FORCE DOFLAMINGO VIDEO
We still need an Eminence in Shadow/Cid Kagenou video.
Nah Azula hit the spiderman Pose ,that's wild 😂
GRIFFITH NEXT
When part 2 of demon king of rizz
13:29 when side character is dumb
Finally a new series I'm so excited
On the bright side, I hear that in the comics she actually goes on her own Zuko-esque redemption arc where she finds the goodness in herself.  Good for her.
Cj can you do an episode on engel of death literally overflowing with psycho💀
I like this new asylum series But yk..azula is also 14 soooo...maybe people need to try to understand how a 14 year old would go crazy with the pressures of being a ruler of a dictatorship and having a trash dad/no love from your mother lol
W series
If I do not see a junko vid in the asylum I will cry😭😭😭😭
Nah  "Azula's rizz is absolutely terrible" Proceeds to show w rizz
Please do the younger Toguro brother from Yu Yu Hakusho. Pure black air force activity.
I’m going to binge watch avatar THEN watch this
idk if youve ever done game characters but vaas from farcry 3 needs to be locked up lol
we missed you Cj Champ no weird shit
I can’t wait for 007
Doflamingo vid. Just saying.
Shadows Of Evil at the end lol
Dang, I forgot half of the crazy stuff Azula did. Great to hear from you again, Cj. Hope Junko Enoshima is next to be examined. She definitely needs it.
Azula fumbled
7:03 song name?
He should just do the jojo roster for the crazies
the lenarr sample doe
So if we’re doing nominations, I nomimate orochimaru for the asylum, he needs to be locked up with how much he keeps fiending over sasuke’s body.
For this series, there needs to be a sixth level where it's just titled azula, it would be hilarious 😂
E
she fine tho
I knew it I called it he would take this menace in she has badass lines she is some beyond black forces
I've watched this anime more times than I can count and I remember hating Azula. If she was in a death battle I wonder who would fight her?
I can't wait to see the joker and junko from danganronpa
Shhhhhiiiiii put me in the asylum azula bad😩
Crazy Luna from boondocks definitely needs a vid
Fun fact tom-tom was mai's younger brother
Bro, this guy is hilarious. He needs to narrate the next avatar series.
Coochiebandit445 is crazy 😂😂😂
Azula was a straight boss. Strategic, cunning, thoughtful, and precise.. then after Mai and her next friend betrayed her, she became reckless and brave. She literally could've had it all if she wasn't drunk on power.
When Black Air Force activity spills over this is what happens
Nuttier than squirrel shit.
Ay azula stood on business tho🦍🦍
I’m like a new series I want more keep it up bro
Wait til you read the manga/comics after😂
I'm not going to lie, I am looking forward to this new series.  I'm just using this as an example because I know CJ already discussed her explioits but the series reminds me of when he differentiated Hayase's Psycho Bitch Energy from Black Air Force Energy.
Yooo! That muscle man reference! 😂😂😂😂😂
Great idea of the new series. And love the Game Over Shadows of Evil theme as the ending of the vid.
Are we going to talk about 14:24? Cuz I feel like we really should 😰
So no one talks about it but had katara been given 3 more seconds she would've broken azula legs and cropped her
20:09 this scene is just perfect blue fire surrounding her i mean damn
PLEASE make a kurostuchi episode. we need to see the fucking MADNESS that the 12th division has to put up with after kisuke got banished (or do it after the 3rd cour of the thousand year blood war comes out)
I'm not going to be on one of the asylum episodes, right?
Man you know it's bad when cj has to use the original audio
this is good af
16:40 I would have said "you really think so, I try to look good"🥰
I knew cj was uploading this week somehow
Seeing Azula fight was amazing. Watching her slow descent into madness was one of the hardest hitting things I'd ever seen in a cartoon.
i can fix her
Awesome episode, looking forward to the next one.
The Asylum is fire. More please
Motherless behavior
17:37 & i got burned....
bro make a video on gojoooo
I know i cant fix her, but its the journey that matters.
Shout out to CJ for bringing the aslyum and the Patient roadmap.
17:29 this part. I will personality kissing her face. I don't care if i get burned or electrocuted & on top of it her insanity. I will go for DM'S prize just maybe she'll realize " damn this feels fucking good " because imma simp.      I grew up liking azula so....
I've seen the show back then, and yeah, I agree with what you explained. Azula is a monster made by her father, and it seems no amount of therapy can turn that around.
10:19 😏😏😏
She really front-flip Hadoukened bro. That itself is insane
THE COMICS ARE HOT SHIT DONT WASTE YOUR TIME READING EM
I can fix her
Azula wasnt just a spoiled ass princess, she would literally run the fade with all of them grown ass niggas and body them 😂😂
Love the new series bruh! Definitely on-brand for you. Keep it up 👍🏾
The amount of COD Zombies references are amazing. 😊😊
17:07 was wild 😮
I mean at least we know it’s coming once a month don’t know when in the month but cj gone drop some heat
Couldn’t agree with you more Cj, lock her up!!😂 Great job on the new series👍🙏❤️✌️🔥
Can't wait for more
didnt get the appeal of why people are attracted to azula, but then i remembered a certain phrase: grippy socks = grippy box and then i questioned whats beyond grippy socks, and then it all connected.
Omggg I love that you covered her!
CJ MAKING A VIDEO? never thought I'd see the day.
i hate that azula is the way a ton of dudes found out they liked toxic girls😂
Cj please do eminence in shadow next
i can fix her
3:57 Fun fact: originally the writers planned for Azula to straight up vaporize that dude on the spot after he f*ed her plan up. But they changed it cuz..y'know.. it's a kids show lol
Say what you will but Azula stood on business
All this because she thought her mom hated her, damn she a demon fr fr
... Bet the top goes crazy tho.  IM JUST SAYING IM JUST SAYIN
Honestly when I was younger Azula was a 10 for me idc what y’all say
The reason I love insane women
16:50 ngl I could not stop laughing at how bad that was and its been a long time sense i watch the show
Here’s an idea for another series if you want: The Doghouse, where we deal with the absolute most hardcore motherfuckers to ever live
Zuko’s ponytail was part of his punishment for losing  the Agni Kai to add insult to to injury
Can't believe I used have a crush on crazy girls
Azula is a prime example of what happens when you don't show your kids enough love.   14:51 And can we take a moment to appreciate how good Azula looks without her lipstick?
Cj finally posted!
Mai = Best Girl
I can fix her
A whole lot of pretty with a whole lot of insanity.   Azula:  My mom called me a monster. Azula: "She was right though."
Azula no matter the mental state, will always be a menace. That's why she has the blue fire
The asylum was genius
I'd still hit though
iroh should at the round table of black air force energy
Glad to see you back. Who says you can't throw hands at someone mid-transformation?... Only a psychotic character could pull that off. Great start to a new series. Everything you produce is gold encrusted
Early gang
LUV THIS SERIES IDEA!!!! Great 1st patient. Other patients waiting to be locked up: Hisoka, Karma (AssClass), Yuno, Chika (Love is War), Yumeko, Eric Cartman, Izaya (Durarara), Dokuro-chan.
CJ transition was crazy. He had to jump cut for her terrible rizz
Her rizz was so bad CJ broke the fourth wall
16:50 You know she has L Rizz when Cj Da Champ just stares at the camera with hardly any edits
In the comics she tracked down her mother, finds out her mother lost her memory, tries to kill her while fighting the god who gives humans faces, and hugs her. In that order
Ngl i can fix azula
Fantastic video
If he did video games nagito konaeda gotta be next.
Crazy p = gud p. Lvl5 crazy
C'mon dude black to black u know u wanna do rimuru
You should do that crazy girl from to your Eternity
Figures Azula would be the first to be portrayed in a new series…. She probably threatened to fry CJ!
0:53 CJ DON’T TEASE, WE DEFINITELY NEED SATOKO or JUNKO NEXT EPISODE‼️
Not just any kid. Her little sis.
Yo cj talking about insanity how about yuo place number 002 aka kenpachi
She’s just built different fr😭🖐🏾 10:13
FINNALLLLY
Azula is the first character In avatar that made me say fuck the fire lord Aang we need to prioritize😂😂
that Baddest Bitch! I'm Scared and I still want some.
YOOO This was really good. I enjoyed it so much. It made me laugh a little bit. But she’s the first crazy psychotic insane woman champion
And she ain’t get no better in the comics, she was gang affiliated, and jumping government officials. All while sayin if she find her mom she gonna got her
yo cj Dachamp, I know you probably got some crazy one's lined up for the asylum but check out happy sugar life, positive this one close to the top of the list of crazy's. nah probably generous to call her crazy. but check it out i think you'll agree.
Fianlly
New vid, new segment and its on my family favorite...sign my ass up
I’m not even gonna lie, Azula is her. Every time she shows up on screen, you KNOW some shit is boutta go down.
Noooooo!!! You leave for months and come back without the fuckin intro?!!!!! The best touch to it is the Naruto hand sign sound! PLEASE BRING THAT BACK
A CH upload omg LETS GO
The Asylum is gonna need a LOT of holding cells, theres too many fucking pyschos out here lmfao.
Uh, Zuko was humiliated, burned, and banished because he spoke out of turn *_once!!_* Azula doing her damnedest to keep Ozai's approval isn't insanity as much as simple survival instinct!
When the world needed him most….
Cant wait for him to get to kakeguri
Her schizophrenia only got worse as the comics progresses dawg yet somehow managed to be gaslighter certified
why is azula insane, is she stupid?
Lez goo
Azula singlehandely introduced kids to psychopaths, toxic friends & family members, elitism and most importantly KARENS. 🤯
Can’t wait for Hidan to be in Asylum
Guys, i think cj is runnimg out of ideas💀
I've been waiting for this one 😁😁😁
Brilliant idea, there are so many completely insane characters out there. I hope the Asylum has plenty of rooms. 🤣🤣
Damn, starting out kinda strong with the new series, aren't we? There's not many that can top Azula's descent into madness.
I’ve wanted this video for so long THANK YOU CJ!!!! But how did you let Slade beat her to the table lol
I would hereby like to nominate Betelgeuse from Re:Zero-Starting life in another world.  Everything he does is proof he needs an entire floor dedicated to him at the asylum.
7:55 this is extra funny because she got confirmation for Nick All Star Brawl 2
WILL WE GET THE SPIDER-MAN WITH THE BLACK SUIT ON OR NA?
Ah Azula, she was something~ The tides line was cooler than her fire color.
I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!!!🎉🎉🎉
Yoo that azula video finally out 😂😂😂😂😂
Great vid! Love Azula.
YEAH BOY I ASKED FOR THIS MONTHS AGOOOO YEAHHHHH
He,s back do baki vs yujiro
As a guy who just finished Jojo & ChainSawMan not too long ago, I can easily say 85% of the characters from those shows need to be locked in the Asylum  CJ! 💯
Im glad he made a video on Azula cuz this is hands down the GREATEST show of all time no contest
Me: Chris Tucker!  Chris: You one Craazy ASS _BITCH!_
That Captain single-handedly saved the series. Cause if he didn’t say that Dumb shit Aang wouldn’t have had a fire bender teacher
Glad you back brotha. I missed the content
I look for the new series
I can fix her fs
Joker’s episode would be like an hour long 😂
Listen this shit was so good Man that giel was crazy af
If Azula was real...I would gladly give my heart and my life to her knowing full well that SHE will kill me OR i'd ve killed for her. AND I'LL DO IT WITH GLEE AND A SMILE!
I'd like to personally nominate Cell to Black Air Force as well. His Imperfect form alone should easily a spot amongst the ranks. I mean come on, we all saw what he did to those people and the Androids when he emerged onto the scene in DBZ.
THANK THE LORDS THIS MF ACTUALLY UPLOADED🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣
Motherless is crazy 😂💀
We need a red lotus black Air Force vid
Azusa really is the baseline for insanity
I GOTTA TAKE A DOODOO‼️ I GOTTA TAKE A DOODOO(YEAH)🔥🔥🔥
Azula is absolutely a menace fr fr. Love avatar the last Airbender show.
Whenever you see Azula you know it’s on demon time. She is always ready for the smoke 😂
Does father Anderson count for this🤔
New series fire
THE KING RETURNS
W Vid
Watching the video blow up fast within hours is crazy
Never thought id see this man make a video about this show
Cj def a Sega and Nintendo kid
Seeing how they both grew up Zuko was beyond lucky to bond with Iroh Azula damn sure ain’t a saint by her but Ozai purposely and unfortunately Ursa indirectly and unintentionally was the prime factor of how she grew to be how we see her
Ooo ooo ooo does Yuki Terumi get put in the asylum?
Fun fact: azula is THE ONLY fire bender who can use blue fire😅
Azula: "ENTERTAIN ME BITCH!" Me:💀
Can we just take a moment to talk about how azula was so fucking ready to absolutely Merk katara  Like if katara didnt have that water SHE WOULD BE DEAD!
We need a toji  fushiguro roundtable episode, dudes a straight menace
I can fix her
Damn
The shadows of evil game over music at the end was golden
The way he said "bitch" took me tf out 💀💀
“Babe wake up cj da champ posted”
This series abouta get wicked. Hisoka next??
Iroh: Niecey, stop it.
ANOTHER CJ UPLOADDDDDDDDD AHHHHHHHHHH
Me waiting for evil Sasuke and Madara
Aizen gotta be next or ken 💯
You have azula almost ending the entire avatar line with 0 difficulties yet you still got people clowning korra when people know the avatars state exact weakness and deliberately aiming for it 💀
Lol your description really made me laugh. u a natural at making peoples days.
YOU'RE BACK!!!  I too have not read a single of the comics that come after the show, but apparently she started getting better.  I'd still keep her locked up though.
All anime characters: hold up, i need to charge up my attack. Azula: Sorry, that seems like a personal problem.  *Attacks anyway*
I cant WAIT till he does Yuno Gasai if he gets the chance
Pls do Deadman Wonderland Literally almost everyone in that bitch is crazy. Everyone like so he sees
Yo Where the Yoshikage Kira video?!
do one of these on  Johan Liebert from the anime MONSTER.
W
Azula is who we thought Itachi was
Don’t forget bout da bih from to ur eternity….
3:14 Yes, it actually was part of Zuko's banishment but the show never made that fact known.   For firebenders, the ponytail (it's really a top-knot but I digress) is a sign of honor. If a firebender were to lose an important Agni Kai (e.g. Zuko refusing to fight against his father for his honor), they would have to shave parts of their head bald, leaving only the top-knot intact.
You gotta do the girl from dragon prince
A perfect idea for a new series. Too many Jojo characters are gonna end up here
ngl i can fix her
15:14
Azula is such a bad bitch
Don flamungo next?????
Get Gogo after he used the reverse cursed technique
4:00 Should have been, "I beg your pardon."
14:23 What the fucking why?!?!?!?
Look at iroh stance when they was bout to jump azula😂
14:23 yo what the fuck is this son!? 😂
Can’t believe that a part of my Birthday gifts is that CjDachamp decided to upload today
I want Shredder to be next, He’s got that dog in him in 2007, Althugh Alzula is insane in the Avatar series
Insane Female Villian? Big Mom is next
I know we finna get a video on someone from higurashi
Holy shit I hope you do an episode on the Joker! That will break the internet!!!!
I like this concept
So this is were the griffith video is gonna end up
Okay in the near future I wanted to see Junko enoshima very soon alright I just wanted to get in the way
I honestly hoping for another episode for the asylum soon because this is amazing made me laugh hard.
Soooooo is she a member of the roundtable or not I’m so lost right now
some people(me) still on the 'i can fix her' type beat tho
Now we gotta wait another 3 months
Zuko would've bodied Azula so badly if Katara hadn't sold she could've just hid somewhere
Honestly, this new series makes sense, some characters are too cracked to be on the round table, Azula is a great example of that.
Good start to what will be an amazing series
Idc she bad asf
Do a video of petelgeuse romanee-conti from Rezero he crazy af
I know it isn't exactly anime but is there any chance Jinx from arcane could get a feature in this? she would really fit in.
this was funny man
Yo cj wtf is up whit her
SICK. New series!! I like it
lets have all these menaces in one arena and lets see who wins a full out civil black airforce energy war 😅
Love the new series idea cj, we gotta add Dabi from my hero to the asylum
shoutout to grey delisle for voicing Azula, the 14 year old that manipulated her 16 year old brother
LMAO
If you’re a psychopath then Azula might’ve said the smoothest pickup line ever XD
love the new content 😂
Finally bro uploads.
Do mugen next PLSD
i forgot how fire this show is
w video
This nigga got a bunch of copycats 😂
Took u long enough
Bro, whyyyyyy would you do that to the absolute G of that entire series and give Iroh some hood translation? That man's wisdom is beyond reproach and time lmao🤣🤣🤣
Nah bro you left out the craziest thing Azula ever said.  "My own mother thought i was a monster..."  "She was right though, but it still hurt."  And who can ever forget: "No. She's crazy and needs to go down."
W cj vid as always frfr.
You know she’s crazy and evil when your own Mother is scared of you when you’re a small child.
The King returns 👑
Ok just saw it man this shit fire
Orochimaru gotta be the next patient
You should fr do a griffith one (w video would recommend to new edgers)
So this is where were gonna find Griffith huh?
I can fix her.
U really need to to do light yagami that man started off as a good student to a serial killer
All right, so we all agree that the second patient has to be someone from Soul Eater, right? Either the kishin, stein, or black blood users
yoooooo sup
Azula was so unhinged that she needed to be locked away for how insane she was throught the whole series
I wanted to see her redemption in Legend of Korra so bad. How she would watch over Zuko from the shadows and all that
Bro u gotta do attack on titan next trust me your vid will be Firee❤❤    u could do eren vs riner or eren vs annie
Why don't you have a cup of calming jasmine tea, we're going to be here awhile
Not him starting the anime version of Arkham Asylum 🤣🤣🤣
When you're *the* General that attempted to take Ba Sing Se, lost a son & failed the siege, *in his age of experience, wisdom & capability* would rather attempt to live a life *in that very city*, than face his niece.    Thats saying *volumes* to her potential if she never mentality snapped.
Yo bro don't even bother putting the joker in here he just ganna brake out my dude
17:45 What's that theme? It sounds familiar
wp
Do light from death note
Yep she’s just a menace
Nah cuz lowkey I do feel bad for Azula  Like Ozai was a shitty dad and Ursula only paid attention to fuckin Zuko.  She a whole ahh bihh but she’s a whole ahh bihh cuz her whole ahh bihh family.
Azula in the comics went even more mental
Shouldn't she be patient zero?
When I was a kid I had her as my cartoon crush
Journey to insanity, you need to get light yagami in here
7:50 Damn, that really does look like Gigan Rocks from Sonic Riders Zero Gravity. Nice music pick!
2 for  this month I'ma need it, Halloween and all
It looks interesting... I wonder who the next patients will be?
The way you voice Azula reminds me of the Boondocks
And I already see DIO from JOJO being the biggest mental case
CJ never disappoint
Man can't wait for hisoka and both kiras, light and yoshikage. Big fan of the series I did gives a lot more opportunities for characters who aren't specifically menaces even though there is quite a bit of overlap between the two
Do Orochimaru
They call her Azula because she possess Azure flames. Just a theory
I love this series, Cj dachamp  Keep up with the work!!!
Now I know that you said commence rehabilitation but like let’s be honest there’s no fixing this bitch
YOU HAVEN'T READ THE COMICS!?!?!?  OHHH BUT YOU MUST!! There's so much closure, and she becomes a menace AGAIN. Also, it's good that you made this cause she's going to star in the next big arc of the graphic novels next year, following her most recent terrorism.
A tier content ong
If that bitch from Mirai Nikki ain't the next patient idek bruh
Boot eren off the roundtable and transfer him here.
"Sonic and Mario wall jumps" only real OG's knows what he's talking about.
This should be called the violator  series
CJ ISSS BACKKKK  BUTT CJJJJJJJ I NEED YAMI VID  HE BEEN SITTING AT THAT DAMN TABLE FOR TO LONG TO NOT HAVE A VID
9:06 his Shadow the Hedgehog. 9:23 👍 9:35 Aang was doing those Mega Man X jumps. 9:45 10:41 13:51 Horrible team up. 13:58 to 14:06 Azula's most evil moment. 15:30 😁 17:55 😆 18:22, 18:26, 18:35, and 18:38 ALRIGHT!! 👍 18:54 19:54 to 21:18 NOPE. 21:57 to 22:17 Zuko came back! 23:00 Level Absolute 5! 23:16 Katara 👍
Shou tucker ep. gonna be wild sad.
Idk why but I feel like Azula should’ve been in mortal kombat 1 cause she is a MENACE A FIEND SHE KILLED THE MAIN CHARACTER basically
Hell yes I am gonna watch the hell out of this series
AZULA ALWAYS LIES...AZULA ALWAYS LIES...AZULA ALWAYS LIES...AZULA ALWAYS LIES...AZULA ALWAYS LIES...
The man, the myth, the legend.
I’m fw the series already
You should make a video about Kraven the Hunter from marvel Spider-Man 2  This man is a menace  and has black Air Force energy everywhere around him
I like this new series!
Can u do seto kaiba
This is like the 4th time I've thought "haven't seen a CJ video in a while, better check YT isn't ignoring my subs again" and then there is one posted like 2 hours ago
Growing up with Nickelodeon, I knew their female villains would be unhinged. Examples? Ember, Beautiful Gorgeous, Princess Mandie and Queen Vexus.
Ayyo CJ What it do Cuh!
Get Grimmjow up in this shit
she honestly could go to hall of menaces or whatever its called
CJ never fails to fill me up with his sticky content
I would like to nominate Uncle Iroh for the Black Airforce Energy Roundtable, man helps Zuko process his F-ed up childhood after his mom dies, makes sure he doesn't die on the suicide mission of capturing the avatar, breaks out a maximum security prison, joins the Illuminate, and helps save the world, all while being one of the chillest people known to mankind.
Good idea for a new series. PLENTY OF CRAZIES HERE.
Very fun idea for a video series. I like the way you're doing the sanity system as well, Azula is an S-class choice to start with. Will definitely try to recommend some characters that could fit this style. Thanks for the video.
Since this is an avatar video: "When the world needed him most... HE RETURNED!"  Also since we on Avatar, I think Zaheer (the old air bender in Legend of Korra) should get a spot on the roundtable. He aqquired airbending, wasted zero time busting out of prison, freed his homeboys, then immediately went to go after the avatar and to top it off, he folded literally the entire cast just to captue Korra! Oh I should mention, he killed the Earth Kingdom queen by suffocating her, literally bending the oxygen out of her throat! (I don't understand how airbending could do that, but still)
I love this new series idea! Welcome back, CJ!
They say to never stick it in the crazy, but then why the crazy gotta be so hot? >.<
Azula stay hating Zuko for no reason!! She’s on the top of HATING! 😵
Finally this bum posted🤦🏾
1:15 The asylum rehab sessions are gonna be fun.  15:55 It was extreme, but this is one of the two times I liked Azula's actions.  17:26 And this is the second.
Have to save this video for when i eat frfr
We need junko, yuno gasai, and johan liebert
My favorite character despite not watching the show. An absolute menace. Not sure if her voice actress will see the vid but hope she gives it a shout out man.  Also we all know Ch'Rell is next for The Asylum and The Roundtable. If y'all know, y'all know...
WWW
Actually, yeah- the ponytail IS part of the banishment. Lose an Agni Kai of significant enough importance, you shave till that's all you got.
Can do Catra from She Ra and the Princess of Power she is really similar to Azula while being just as brutal and cunning
Bills due 😂
8 year old me loved me some azula
The brother returns for a insane check🎃
Yo you should do ine from gundam iron-blooded orphans
LOVE CJ!!! Dope new series can’t wait for the next nut job
Azula is the character that made me realize what true insanity is
Ayoo w video
Whose the character at 1:02 ?
I got go finish the anime first ✌️
The black air force asylum
From OP characters come Insanity characters.
Oh yeah. We definitely need a Hosoka and Joker video.
I woulda cuffed her and got her pregnant, aang ain't a real nga
I predicted the black Air Force asylum
The Giratina theme is killing me 😭
Avatar is weak because of the fact that the fire princess
Love the new content! I would love to see CJ do a video on the first season of The Eminence in Shadow.
Azula was just Pure Evil and Broken bro
Noted. In American Anime, you can attack the protagonist during their power-ups. Someone better warn Clark from that new Superman show.
Wait wait CJ, are you actually planning on making a Junko vid, dawn now that's something I'll be waiting hyped
,❤this is beautiful
Where is that music at the end from
Azula can be a hilarious character, but even the hilarity can make her more horrifying. My examples there are how she recruited Ty Lee, how she showed her very low rizz, and how she sounds like she's been obsessively practicing her words beforehand every time she talks. The dramatic presentation of her character feels so much like a given, and as if the creators know how reality can be stranger than fiction, the comedy makes her feel so disturbingly real.
Fire Nation City Girls is crazy 😭
Azula started tweaken the rest of the series💀😭
LETTTSSSSS GOOOOO
wtf
@Cj I think I speak for a lot of people when I say “PUT THAT CRAZY PINK HAIRED BITCH ALSO KNOWING AS THE QUEEN OF THE YANDERE’S (at this point goddess of yandere’s) IN THAT BITCH WITH AZULA’S CRAZY ASS!”
CJ can you cover on unicorn War
I can fix her
Bruh we need Cjdachamp to do full video on JJK and their jumpings. I'm also waiting for him to add Toji and Gojou to the black air force table😂😂😂
Need a vid talkin abt the goat uncle Iroh
Finally
kira vid next
Aang really saw his top opp get lil boyed & hit the air dash😭
Solid idea for a new series. Love your videos.  Edit: NGl gonna rewatch the series again after seeing this.
Azula is an embodiment of Black Air Force Energy bro.... She was fucking relentless and I respect the fuck out of her. She was done dirty..
Azula just needed to get laid
Day 1 of asking for guts
Now i want to see hisoka in one of these video now.
The real scary thing is that in the comics she somewhat regained her “sanity” and dialed from psychotic back down to sociopathic.  But she was on her yandere s—t with Zuko, officially earning that title. By trying to warp Zuko into a cruel dictator like her father, JUST for her to make sense of the world because the b—-h simply can’t comprehend peace. 😂  I swear when I read her going free I haven’t felt such terror since I hear that the Booty Warrior was released from prison. 🤣😂
CJ POSTEDDD LES GOO ‼️‼️
Do Kira from jojo  next
16:29 the way all 3 of them looked at her while she looking hardcore like a man 😄😄😄
Love your vidz ma dude, but where is Omni man video tho?
Do Guts or Griffith from Berserk for the black air force energy
Azula is one of the best written examples of parent induced psychosis ever. She was a menace created by another menace
Azula is a true Highlights of Insanity in anime history. Even though it wasnt anime.
Ay bro, ain’t gon hold u, half the round table belongs at the asylum Fr 💯💯
Azula was such a menace!
I'm a simple man c j post something I click Then I like
As always CjDaChamp you never miss, that Azula video hits hard and is hilarious, it never hit me how crazy Azula was until now and it’s wild, her being in a straight jacket was brain rattling
Damn this man defied the entire JJK bandwagon and took us back to our childhood to remind us what a menace this woman truly was
Fuckers be like, "I can fix her"
Bro I can fix her
the bo3 zombies shadow of evil at 23:44
Saw a video talking about a comic they’re making where Azula actually gets redeemed and starts training with Aang.
Cj I curious about the asylum but where's Shedder where's Yami where's Kenpachi and where's Mugen since two parts of the tybw of it are over Kenpachi would be perfect some uneducated people need a demonstration on Kenpachi also farther demonstration on Aizen mainly when he was folding the Captains, Lieutenants, and Visors
Ty Lee actually betrayed Azula first. She actually put hands on her. Mai just said know what I love my MAN more than I fear yo crazy ass, hate me if you want bitch I’m done.  It was more like a friendship ending over her trying to KILL her bae.   Ty Lee on the other hand saw herself the ONLY one being with Azula after that and said : “yeah fuck this shit I’m NOT letting MY friend get smoked, so fuck this! IM OUT “ and turned her ass into a rag doll.   Bonus points: the fact she wanted to scorched earth The earth Kingdom is a testimony to how crazy the bitch is. She got that shit from her fathers side for sure.
I can fix her i swear 😂
Azula did all of this at the age of FOURTEEN. Had they let her roam free, she would have been a bigger war criminal than her pops
you need to build a team so we get these joints out faster
After careful consideration given the evidence, still would.
Ngl, Azula fine as hell. I'd hit.
I hope you don't forget about the round table of BF
CJ where is Toji
I’ve been looking forward to this.
Let’s go cj uploaded
I really love this change, the mfs that will be here are literally only second to the mfs in the round table
Similar sort of downfall is currently happening to Sssniperwolf, it's great to bearwp witness to💀
she kinda bad tho
The round table was cooking but The Asylum is on point as well - I'm all in CJ.
CJ we need a detour. Iroh might be the most zen person who's black air force certified. don't let unc's calm demeanor make us forget how bro has warcrimes to his name, made his own family into ops, threw hands with em too, just to go back to his teashop after running smoke with his entire nation and having fled the country to ba-sing-se like a witness 😤
She bad af tho
Bro when that pt 2 if the Asylum coming out and more contents of the black force energy love your channel
W video  as always
Azula was the true main villian of the series not the Fire Lord.
We’re all expecting yoshikage Kira in solitary confinement 💀
10:59 The fart Sound 😂 16:08-20:31 😂😂😂
That's why he the anime story telling GOAT!
Azula traumatized me when she hit Aang with that "Special Beam Cannon" to the back.        Ty Lee is best girl, prove me wrong.
AYE GOOD VIDEO COULDNT HELP BIT NOTICE THE BRAVE FENCER MUSASHI MUSIC SOMEBODY IS CULTURED
Another golden video CJ. But that scaling should have been higher by that final fight she was atleast 8 maybe level 9.
She's so crazy she doesn't even deserve to be on the roundtable
My glorious king cj posted
Oh this is just the cartoon, she's even crazier in the comics....
9:23 was that a smg4 scene because I watch their channel too 😅.  11:41
I like this new format for the round table/asylum
i like this new series, and i know so many character who should end up in here
Mei is one of the baddest bitches from Avatar, do I have a thing for goth chicks? Yes.
Have you heard of Cid Kagenou?
Game is game😂😂😂
The homies ova H0s beat in thw backdrop had me dyin
*flashbacks* why why her of all people i remember it all
Hell yeah that shit was fire my dude!!!!
Oh my god, the Asylum of the B.A.F., home to people who are crazy as they are ruthless... damn. Azula has as much mercy as she has rizz, and while on the topic, I ask of you to cover the Lich from Adventure Time, that man was a menace who needed a whole other show to be put down.
Azula was the biggest mole through the entire series. That girl was wild af.
I’m hoping eventually we get an Iroh Round Table Exhibit
Yoshikage kira really is a damn weirdo
You know it’s a good day when cj dachamp uploads 😊 I love this nigga videos so much
11:00 we just gonna ignore how Azula accidentally body slammed anng to the wall 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro where have you been? I need my daily dosage of Black Air Force content 😭
Surprised you haven’t done Baki and Yujiro fight yet 😂
3:13 To answer, this hairstyle is more than likely to keep the hair out of his face when he's in the middle of a fight. Like how in science class before you do a lab, people with long hair ( mostly girls) have to have their hair tied up and out of their face. Sokka ven has a similar hairstyle, but it's just noticeably shorter.
The trendsetting out here with new ideas. Going where no man has dared to go before. You love to see it.
Too many people copied CJ's flow so he had the created a new whole new one
1 month later since he uploaded it felt like 5 finally he’s back.
Nah he got the tender logo on his head 💀 7:17
Smash .
I can only imagine how many Psycho anime girls will end up on the asylum.
Another Masterclass
U gotta do monster. I ain’t even gonna tell u whose the crazy mofo. You’ll know.
Loving this new series already.
Cid Kagenou (Shadow) needs to join the round table!!
In the novels she breaks out of prison started a cult kidnaps children and then finally find and tries to murder her mother.... PSYCHO AINT EVEN CUTTING HER INSANITY
Yo cj pleae do a video on the 2003 or 2012 shredder next i heard you joke about it in your afro samurai video so i am praying you make one someday 🙏
At the end due cod misce hit
"katara was really out here  surviving a horror movie."  That speaks volumes when a character is up against something out of a horror movie
This is awesome, but I’m afraid of what we’re gonna see when Junko Enoshima gets her analysis
Only true avatar the last airbender/Korra fans can like this comment  👇✅
They fr put her in the same game as spongebob and garfield i cant bro 🤣
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
New series New characters  More insanity. Happy Halloween, I’m looking forward to this,especially I just rewatched Pickle’s trial for the round table.😁
Now make a vidoe about Zuko and the rest
I just got done watching this series not too long ago and it reminded me how much of a crazy bitch she was 😂😂
W fucking series
Since we're doing azula we might as well do Harley Quinn and jinx
The asylum is going to get overcrowded real quick, here’s some off the top of my head. 1. Hisoka 2. Yuno Gasai 3. Vaas 4. Light Yagami 5. Kenpachi 6. Mayuri 7. Shigaraki  8. Junko 9. Kid Buu 10. No Bark Noonan 11. Seth (RDR) 12. Trevor (GTA 5) 13. Sheogorath 14. Joker 15. Kevin (Original Ben 10) 16. Frieza (Anyone who can hold a grudge like Frieza ain’t sane.😂) 17. Stinkmeaner 18. Albert Wesker 19. Deadpool 20. Dark Phoenix 21. Harley Quinn 22. Patrick Star 23. Plankton 24. Marrick (Yugioh) 25. Adam West (Family Guy.😢) 26. Darth Maul 27. Rick Grimes 28. Chucky 29. King Bradley There’s tons more but there’s only so much I can think of on a 10 minute break.🤣 (Anyone welcome to add more that I might’ve missed please do.)
Next up for the asylum needs to be either Light or Griffith
I’m 100% behind the new series. I love the round table, and I’d hoped that there would be some more content with commentary on other outlandish moments/characters from pop culture. This definitely fits what I was hoping for and I couldn’t think of another character better to kick it off
To anyone who don’t  know azula  will have a redemption arc
Im nowhere near fitst but I'm here and I love this video so damn much.
Aye aye aye!!! If we talkin Asylum, we gotta talk about Stein from Soul Eater over some cloaca.
Great start to a new series. Excellent work here Cj.
I would
Give your kid one name if you want, two names if you want, but don't give them one name twice, that's just mean
The question is what the line between having black air forces vs. the asylum? Because alot of black air force activity could be mistaken for the asylum.
You're gonna need a whole separate asylum for the Joker.
Also, bro I love your videos please make more
Black air force candidates.  1. Hisoka 2. Esdeath 3. Saitama 4. Garou 5. Toji 6. Spike 7. Dracula 8. Trevor 9. Bakugo 10. Nanami
I want to date him because watching shows would be having me dying! 😂 this is comedy gold!
When i was a kid Azula was like the definition of if someone had hall of fame intimidator and chase down on gold to how she was on their ass but when i saw her get chained up it moved from hall of fame to bronze nah that shit with to aluminum foil to how i looked at her all chained up 😂
Ayo call batman to bring dis psychopath to the arkrum asylum wit da rest of dem
Shadows of evil music at end was the top tier
Tokyo ghoul
Oh nah we gotta get a yoshikage Kira episode now
Amazing man I must see the next video
I won't lie: Azula scared me as a kid
Ah naw the Asylum different different
Tom-Tom got dat tinder logo on his forehead.
Even though I know he is an anti-hero but of all the animes and mangas I have seen\read Accelerator stands above all in terms of insanity . I don't care if he is a good guy . His laugh is what makes him stand above all and his act makes him my favorite . Other psycho's I may recommend are : a] Hayase from To Your Eternity b] Cutthroat from Akudama Drive c] Himiko Toga from My Hero Academia d] Light Yagami from Death Note c] Junko Enoshima from Danganronpa d] Most of the people in Overlord [Especially Renner and Clementine] e] Yumeko Jabami and Midari Ikishima from Kakegurui f] Haruna Niekawa from Durarara !! g] Kikyo Kushida from Classroom of the Elite [Don't know how she is in LN though] h] Gabriel Miller from Sword Art Online i] Juuzou Suzuya from Tokyo Ghoul [Atleast first 2 seasons] j] Seryu Ubiquitous from Akame Ga Kill k] Doflamingo from One Piece l] Ragyo Kiryuin from Kill La Kill  There are many more but these are for now that come in my mind . I still kinda like most of them 😈😈
With a sister like Azula you gotta sleep with one eye open at all times, cuz GOD HELP YOU if she catch you lackin 👁️
fire vid but we jus not gon talk bout how he be dissappearing HE IS the avatar 😭 😭
Love it
Maybe for another episode you could do Junko Enoshima?
Bro W episode keep the asylum content coming CJ I fucks with this series hard.
Theres a whole video oon azula's psychology which i think you would definitely enjoy. I love azula as a character because her writing is perfect but as a person i just feel bad for her Mom called her a monster and her father sees her as a war machine
Azula was just a crazy privileged b****, always appreciate your work.
I am LOVING this. I hope we see more Asylum episodes in a future, because hearing you rant about the craziness was absolutely hilarious.
Azula is crazy psycho firebending chick she's a nightmare
More like Azula, Shredder's a Menace, A Bad Ass He should put in an asulym or the round table
Yo cj here’s some video ideas right, we like the content but what makes u stand out is ya goated commentary bro. So literally talk bout every stereotypes in anime, the most crazy, the strongest old man, the most down bad, Well watch long as ya commentary is goated as always ❤
I'm still waiting for the Azula Redemption Arc. kek She lost everything her family her friends her home, Nothing to call her own. She's got to realize what is wrong and then work towards moving foward, One step at a time.
Alright of Joker isn't the top dog of this place then. We need to talk
Ngl the scene of her breaking down while chained to the grate actually freaked me out as a kid. Seeing her go from cold and calculating to just straight up schizo melt-down insanity in a matter of days after gaining power had me messed up
Love this new series! Great idea! Question: Can people from BAF Round Table get committed? Because I know a certain Tanya the Evil who needs therapy badly!
Oh my god. I never realized it   I dated an azula.
You know you fucked up when you can't get no hoes during a dang beach episode
I remember a flashback scene where they were kids, Azula comes over to Zuko and said, in a childish mocking way, "Dad's going to kill you, no really, he is" smiling and everything.
Love the Shadows of Evil music 24:06
Love the new series. AWESOME CONTENT
You know something just occurred to me about her and her brother who is the oldest?
Honestly can't put her in a black air force energy thing with the way she went out
I personally think Zuko could have taken her crazy or not
May all the Avatar fans reunite watching this video
Bruh what is that picture 💀📸 14:24
Let's go I hope the next one Is going to crazier
7:51 She on her Zero Gravity.  15:03 THAT MADE ME CACKLE!!!
I could fix her
12:52 betrayer
Personally if I had to work at the Fire Nation, I wouldn’t just exiled myself the moment Azula became Fire Lord. It’s a wonder as to why no one else working under her didn’t simply just say “nope” and secretly walk away, because even if they get hunted, the first thing I’d assume on if I piss Azula off as Fire Lord, is death, not even exile.
I FULLY support The Asylum!!! Good work CJ!!!!
Fck this I want de baki trial
If I have one complaint about AtLA, and trust me I don't have many, it's how they handled Azulas slip into insanity. It was just so quick, it wasn't like I couldn't believe it I just wish it was explored a bit more because it just feels forced without more behind it
😂😂😂Bruh got me dieing
I became a fan of her from her very first intro . And her breaking the anime transformation rule is top tier 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Everyone on the round table practically fits the description of crazy.
DAHLIA HAWTHORNE FROM ACE ATTORNEY FOR THE ASYLUM, PLEASE!!!
I’m so glad joker was in here cause as soon as he said asylum I knew it’d be a missed opportunity to not include him
We all stopped what we were doing as soon as the video popped up😂
abt time the badass cartoons gets some fame
Yo CJ since you like jumping from anime to anime and considering the people you´ll have locked up in here, may I recommend you catch a few Houndoom and use em as guard dogs? If you have read there pokedex entry you can probably guess why. Also they only show this in the anime but this dogs not only have super good smell and hearing, they have no fear and can see in the dark. Let´s see these crazy fool f around and find out with those fire breathing hell hounds on the night watch. 😎
And too this day I would still marry azula🔥
My goat finally found his password
Orochimaru is an inevitability for 002#
What's funny is that not many people know this. BUT AFTER THIS HAPPENED SHE BEGAN A CULT TO TAKE DOWN ZUKO FROM FIRE LORD BY STEALING CHILDREN
I'm loving this, lol hope we get Junko from Danganronpa next
This was funny as hell but towards the end I got sad 😔 her madness is causing me sadness.
i just KNOW roberta's ass is in that asylum...
Better see happy sugar life on here
Gotta say I love this. New, Unique and hella enjoyable as always xD. Can't wait to see your next content. Seen all your vids and showed some to friends lol.
I had a crush on Azula 😅
I can fix her
AYo Cg what's going on😂😂
Don't worry i can fix her
I clicked immediately as soon as I saw Azula. She's my favorite character in the series. Azula made the show so interesting with her personality. Even though she had a mental breakdown, she was a formidable antagonist. Azula also deserves to be at the round table of black air force activity.
If anyone likes Azula, they should be sent to the Asylum with her, no questions asked
shes fourteen. shes fourteen. i need to remind people that azula was FOUR. TEEN. she was doing all this insane stuff when she was barely a TEENAGER
17:25 i remember this part perfectly as a kid. It was so bad i turned off the TV out of  embarrassment for her. Waited a good 2 mins then turned it back on so i don't have to see this train wreck it was so painful.😂😂😂  The worse part for those 2 mins I sat in silence I had a Playstation 2 I could have played splinter cell double agent. I just sat their in pain 🤣🤣🤣
Mikey gonna be having some flashbacks with this one XD
I love you so much and I would like to share this with you. The condemnation is this that everyone has sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. But this is the gospel which means the good news. God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son so that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life. And the only way to be saved is to believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord. Believe that he died and was raised on the third day by God the father. Ask him to receive the holy Spirit. Repent from your sins (which means turn away). And be baptized in the name of the father son and the Holy Spirit. God bless you and have a good day. 🙏 John 3:16
Do more videos often I enjoy you're contents ngl💯💜
I’m fw this new series 🤪💕
Here we go the first series Asylum man this is going to be great Patient #001 Azula here we go!
I was waiting for azula !!she's the queen of crazy
Ah the king weebo is back himself lmao
Shadow of evil game over is too good
I love how Azula’s last straw was being given the throne. After spending her entire life in a cutthroat system and assuming she would need to kill her dad one day, she’s just given it. She’s like a dog that catches the car.
I NEED MORE ASYLUM VIDS❤
YESSSSS A NEW VIDEO
Always a good day when cj uploads
Hisoka needs to be treat as an SCP in the asylum💀
Yall forgetting katara at any time could blood bend her and end the story really fast 😂. Azula was insane but facing katara is flat out suicide 😂
When they say this brother cooks. I did not think it would be literal
Cj uploads. I like and comment. Im a Simple man.
Welp we all know who’s gonna be in the asylum for sure in the future. Starts with G and the series is berserk
This new series is fucking peak bro
Overlord needs to be done
CJ been playing a lot of sonic lately lml.
I have been waiting
With the introduction of The Asylum, there is one character who will definitely get a lengthy episode about them. And a floor all to themselves. Only one could be that dangerous, unstable, and outright psycho to earn their own floor.        The Joker.
Bro I was JUST watching all the Avatar episodes for nostalgia I never would’ve thought we get a Azula compilation from the king himself.
8:12 Zuko has a double ponytail on his head... That is unacceptable, that is nasty work. 😂😂🤣
Ok but smash tho right
If azula is on this list then Dabi from MHA for DAMN sure belongs here.  That nigga is CRAZY
Lmao this was amazing. One character I’d love to see up here would be light yagami (or even mello) and izaya orihara (or maybe he’s better for the round table idk).
Phe no me nal 😅  now this is what we needed lmao 😂
You should Carnage next 😂 that mf went from a serial killer to a god killer
AYO CJ! Good shit man really loving this new series can't wait for the rest
make a video about tokyo revengers season 2
Junko
Honestly struggling to think of a better option for the first choice of insane characters...well played CJ.
I didn’t expect this but I probably should’ve
IROH FOR THE ROUNDTABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
she started a cult as well
The goat uploads again🔥🔥🔥
Ty Lee is best girl in ATLA. I don’t care what anyone else says!
"wake up bro,a new cj dachamp vid came out"
Please do Dabi from My hero academia next. Thank you!
Tf dis tom-tom do 😂😂😭😭
Im so glad that CJ pointed out who really fucked up in the final battle cause to many people blame Katara
Ohhh yess I have been waiting for this one
I’m looking forward to this “Asylum” thing, CJ. I have a soft spot in my heart for psychotic characters.
That good video I think next I hear cj might do shredder but  I hope he do Tokyo revengers part 3
Real talk I fucking love this concept I can't wait to see more. Although I feel like some of the guys on the round table could probably spend a little time in the asylum as well just saying lol.
#1 Favorite character of all time for a while(shared with Tier Harribel)
23:50  shadows of evil music is perfect for such a vile woman
23:43 absolute PEAK CONTENT. Didn't expect less from the best character reviewer of all time. Keep it up Bro!
Yo this series abot to be lit do gojo next
My type of woman fr
This series exists because people keep nominating insane mfs for the Round Table despite them engaging in very little true disrespect.   Azula is a perfect example; she has a couple high-key disrespectful moments like catscratching Zuko's head on the ship during their first fight, and flexing on the Gaang (but especially Toph) on the Day of Black Sun. But she's not even close to earning a seat in the same room as Madara and Buu.
I can fix her?
Gojo for patient #002
CJ got an asylum going better then his update schedule.  But hey great video bro
Aye lets gooo new series
Azula was kinda bad ngl 😂😂 but seriously they robbed Zuko of his fight with that bs plot
She cant be saved
I like the concept for the Asylum bro, great work!
Azula bad asf I’d let her mistreat me
kinda expecting... Satoko from Higurashi gou and sotsu, Shion, some other characters.
Cj don aang dirty in this pic 14:23
Good choice for the first series
Let’s go
I was binging the overanylsis of avatar series right before this so this is perfect
The king is back with another banger of a video
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 W new series
Absolutely perfect keep this series going. Thank you for the entertainment. Can't wait for the next disrespectful moments
Cj Dachamp. Can you do an asylum episode for Carnage and joker that would be so awesome.
W cj
I’ve been waiting for this one
Azula really is Zuko's #1 hater lol.
Gotta do Light Yagami next
Next in the Asylum should be any version of the animated Joker
ZUKO ON TOP
Oh my god I completely forgot about that time azula straight up made that man set Ty lee’s rope on fire. She crazy crazy
So we gonna get yumeko?
16:50 I lost my shit, I completely forgot about Azula having negative rizz 🤣🤣
Crazy or not, Azula can still get it
I could fix her
Joker lvl 99
The “I gotta take a doo doo” absolutely flatlined me lmao 😂 😂😂
I forgot how conflicted Azula had me feeling as a child😭
Oh yeah dis series bout to go crazy and I think I know some characters who deserve to be in THE ASYLUM like someone from Naruto, One Piece, or any other anime but other than that dis series bout to get WILD 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
When Azula shot that lightning at Katara, she remembered that water type is weak to electric.
The drill started cumming man  (Pause) 11:11
I’m here before the copyright strike 😂 jk, you have no idea how hyped I was to see a need vid from you. 🎉
16:22 was the definition of the gaming society
"ENTERTAIN ME BITCH" 😂
This was fire 🔥 😅🤦🏽‍♀️
Orochimaru next!!
Me waiting for joker
Hey CJ I think a good character to add to the asylum would be bill cipher. Especially during the weirdmageddon.
Ooga booga
Need some virgil videos 🔥🔥🔥
He ghost 👻 the blue flame devil 😅?!
Went from Evil Batman to Discount Joker.
WHAT I NEVER REMEMBERD THIS AS A KID!!!!!
Bro I love this new series idea and this character is a perfect start great vid fam
You showed Junko, better release her video soon👀👀
I always know she was crazy but god damn
9:28 zuko falling almost made me piss myself😂😂
Petition for F from alphabet lore to be next [he has many reasons why]
I think Dutch van der Linde would make a perfect video for this channel.
Azula was on a perc the whole entire show
I still don’t see how anyone can NOT like this character.
first of all the earth king was trash , nigga i will let boomie be the king . Nigga we have the fire lord going vs aang man im done with this shit
So can we get kyoshist from Tiktok to comment on this?   lol
16:20 crazy b*tch entered CoD-lobby-voice-chat mode, DAMN
I literally said it’s about time I had my monthly dose of cjdeeeee. And here he is with a certified hood classic
We gotta send a few people to the asylum ASAP😂  Carmilla (Castlevania) Tomura Shigaraki (MHA) Norman Osborn aka Green Goblin (Spider-Man/Marvel) Griffith (Berserk) Eren Jaeger (AOT)
The Asylum Has A Lot Of Candidate's Like Half The Cast Of Arcane Even Real People Like Xi Xin Pin, Putin And That Painter From Austria Etc etc ....
BRO PULLED AN ANDROID 17 ON AANG AND INTERRUPTED THE TRANSFORMATION NAHHH 💀💀
My favorite character w
I know over it was probably a copyright strike against him, but I want to see his Doflamingo video
correction: aang was not in a coma  she straight up killed him  Katara had to use the spirit water which is pretty much a Phoenix down to bring him back
I’m liking this new asylum series already lol I know a few mfs that should be in there 😂
The shadows of evil cameo is real. Also I kinda would expect mahito possibly to be here
I forgot Zuko didn't see the hole and ran straight into it. I lost my shit when i saw that again 😂
My vegeta my sasuke 9:03  😂
22:44 was so perfectly timed
Why did bro use that image Ang 14:23
Who else instantly knew Azula on straight dt when she first appeared
69k views, so i need to be here.
Oh man Cj u are the true champ this is pure fire love it we need more
Azula is so off her nut that when she was asked what were to happen if she were to go on a "life-changing adventure with Zuko", she responded by saying that she would get pregnant!
Oh if we nut jobs that are beyond all tha meds, bro gotta put MHA’s Himiko Toga as our next patient🤪🔪👀
do more avatar content😂😂
All you know is war took me out 15:48
Am i the only one who had a crush on her ?💀
Put Griffith in here lmao
Man I knew someday Azula was gonna be put into this channel someday. DJ Champ you are a god at your job.
How long you think before bro drop the next video
👍
What next? Freeza ? Broly?  Plankton?
7:51 oh cool sonic riders music.
When is the Hood safari coming back?
Cj cooked with this new series.
Azula was crazy but a mf would still risk it all. Yes I am downbad and I know it. This is where my attraction to toxic women started.
New series? I'm all for it
big
This new Asylum format will work perfectly for how many crazy/zesty mfs there are.
She's also known as the black air force princess
Excellent job yet again sir 🫡
The way she almost murdered her own uncle is unforgivable, and I forgot about what she did to Ty-Lee and she actually almost permanently killed the Avatar for good. I don’t call people this word, but Azula is a Bitch…and we all love her for it.
This is without the comics
Another banger
Someone tell CJ about the new jjk shit
10/10 voice overs
Technically attacking Katara is another insanity point cuz Azula never takes a W around Katara
Azusa broke the one rule I all of animes history is to kill a character while they are transforming 💀
Me thinking if Azula used the Joker’s handbook of manipulating people
I’ve been waiting for this
Do eren jager
Yes! Huge fan of this new series and its potential entries. And if this is a place for people with screws loose in their head, I better see my boy with a legit whole ass screw through his head and fully fueled by madness.
YESSSS IVE BEEN WAITING FOR AZULA
bro you don't miss.
Cannot wait for a JUNKO video, absolute W start to a new series with Azula.
“Motherless psycho princess….     ………………That is off a PERC”😂😂😂😂
Hey CJ can you do yuno gassi next she is wildin out
13:00 😂😂
What anime is at 3:25? Feel like I’ve seen it before but can’t remember
I want an AZULA tho
Do de baki trial nah ppl fcking waiting man
Beautiful idea for video and content keep up the work my boii 🔥🔥🔥
We all know damn well we drop everything we doing when Cj uploads
Oh yeah, this is gonna be a good series fellas
W video. Still waiting for an Aizen
I was always more afraid of Azula then i was Ozai, she was unstable and could snap and light you up without hesitation.
LETS GOOOOO ITS BEEN LONG A TIME
Finally I been waiting for you man
Damn, can’t wait for nikki
Boondocks Teacher Japanese VA:Nigga Shiranai
ANOTHER MASTERPIECE KING!!!!!! 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃
0:34: Woah wait. Is that the "My Friendly Neighborhood" background?  Also, "The Asylum" series is perfect for the season.  But yeah, some people are just born evil and want to watch the world burn. No pun intended.
Man you post the worst time when I'm sober😂😂😂
Finally someone said Katara got herself captured.  She see Zuko and Iroh working a 9-5 and immediately reports then.  Like that's low key racist, no investigation, no asking around, just immediately turns them in lol.😂
She deserved to be on the table of black airforce energy.
The goat
Fire bending off a perc is crazy
CJ making a new series? Aw YEAH! That's the hood shit right here. And starting off with the craziest hoe on Nickelodeon, that's a good beginning.
Nah, if Avatar wasn't on Nick and had a higher age rating, Azula would've definitely caught some bodies on screen
How is that you're able to time the memes right when my high ass is laughing my ass off and it kicks it so hard
love this new show man 10/10 azula is a crazy ass hoe !
Please do shinji in next one
Bob
I never watched My Hero but I hear that the villains in that show are crazy as well, especially Toga with her weird blood thing, so I wonder if she would ever make it to the asylum table along with the other villains. That’s just degeneracy.
" I gotta take a doo door. I gotta take a doo doo"  - lenar young
Bout time
Yo NEW SERIES LEZZZZZZ GOOOOOOOOO
I am NOT watching baki bro 😭🙏
Only true cjdachamp fans can like this comment
I saw this and stopped watching another video I was in the middle of
Let’s fucking goooo, I’ve been waiting for this
I tryna think of who else needs to be in the Asylum???
The Asylum huh? I hope I see Petelgeuse from Re:Zero in here or Hayase from To Your Eternity.
Ya Azula, and Joker and more be crazy especially joker cus man’s laughed at death and at his death like holy shit, fuckers like here be insane.
I luv this new series already 😢
Man I had to pause spiderman 2,  Game of the freaking year, just to see this video. Y'all know Cj is that guy.
yeeeeee
Azula, the true hater
10:19 NOT THE PLANTS VS ZOMBIES GARDEN WARFARE MUSIC😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bro literally had to make a whole new Series just to figure out how crazy she is💀💀💀
Fire on a monthly bases
CJ back at it with the quality content 🔥🔥🔥
Watching Azula’s descent into madness was insane back when I saw this show. I hadn’t really seen any other character in any other animated show (I had no real exposure to anime back then, so my options were limited) go through that kind of arc before. She was one of the first villains I remember actually feeling sympathy for (the first may have been Doctor Octopus from Spiderman 2).
I'm telling you bro, do Chris McLean from total drama next
O shit with the pop up thx bro
5:19 "I'm in tune with my zodiac sign right now" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 she seems like the type of girl that would come up with bullshit like that.
Gotta watch this before YouTube strikes
We better get that Tokyo Revengers season 2 CJ recap
No discord server?
On this episode on street hoes we have found ourselves a prime contestant. Famous for her appearance on the asylum and baing a god awful person in every type of way. We have today the most insane bitch Azula.
I can fix her
When can I see Superboy prime?
I can fix her.
Azula gotta be one of the most deranged person I've seen in animation. Manipulating your brother on multiple occasions, being a terrible friend, committing multiple crimes, enjoying other people's suffering, there is something wrong with her
W video but when the shredders trial coming?
Joker better be after this one though
WAKE UP CJ POSTED!!!
Brotha Joker is gonna be on this series and some other wild fools.
Avatar fans like this❤ and cj fans🎉❤
Maiyuri from bleach needs to be in this series. That man is insane
He’s baaaaack!
Junko definitely belongs in the asylum  shit throw her ass in arkham nd have batman watch her😂
4:00 if I'm azula, and the FUCKING CAPTAIN CAME UP WITH THHIS SHIT, I would fire his ass (both ways, you know what I mean).
Love this new series CJ
Hell yeah a new place for new people 😂😂
Ah yes, my crazy ass ex-waifu Azula. The first anime girl that informed me that specific have a type, and that I need help. Never change you flaming psycho bitch.
I think you gotta add Iroh to the round table, exhibit a is how he just dropped Azula ez
Azula is why be both love and hate crazy Chicks💯
Ty lee best girl.
I knew you were gonna make a azula video sooner or later lolol
You start off with Azula my nigga??!! You better have Eric Cartman in this bitch!!!
We all know joker is gonna be in the asylum.
AYO CJ IS BACK!
Ty lee freaked me out as a kid; fuck your bending, I got hands
Yhwach next? Azien? Zaraki?
Ahe literally attacked the MC during a transformation. Menace...
17:44 and again... This episode took me out 😂😂😂
I wanna see my boy kempachi zoraki or beakuya
I needed this today
All right then checking patient: #001 for an indefinite stay.
azula was fr zukos biggest hater. I still laugh when she said to Zuko that shes born lucky and hes lucky to be born😭😭
Love the additional style of video. ❤
CJ what about mama Senjumaru from Bleach ?
I was expecting black air force roundtable but nah this is true insanity c  a s e
That saga was a … slow burn.
Here for the first episode of the asylum. I’m all for it!
Do Zorc/yami bakura next, (Yugioh final season)
Joker has to be the CEO of insanity, gotta do a video with him
Zuko knew she was lying
This was great! Please keep doing more like these :)
The fact that Griffith doesn’t have video is crazy
W New Series. You already know you gotta put in Him from The Power Puff Girls.
Damnit CJ you know you made a joke over a year ago and now must make exclusively black air force videos. We don't make the rules 😂😂
ITS A GOOD DAY WHEN THIS MF UPLOADS LETS GOOOOO
Do another baki video plz
The asylum is crazy 😂
NEW SERIESSS!! LET'S GOOOOOOO!
Denji and thorgil should be in a asylum. Thorgil is quite Lisa menace and not only that he was ready to throw hands with the king of Denmark and kill his men simply because Omar had a duel with someone. Denji is also crazy because the man will do anything just so he could get some coochie from makima, plus he literally ate makima and turned her into a 7 course meal and did this to express his own love to her. If anyone agrees like here 👇🏾
When I saw the Ti Lee 5 black man polar express, I had to pause the video cause I was laughing so hard
On God I just checked the channel yesterday cuz I'm like it's about time for a cj video lmfao
So, I'm hereing she has a redemption. but I haven't seen it, so it fits.  also, if we doing this. are we adding Yanderes up in this, because if so. It's yandere month, and Esdeath is up there with more of them.
I see the theme now. No more Roundtable of menaces, but instead an asylum. Fresh
@Cj Dachamp you need to give that man Roanoa Zoro a seat at the round table of black air-force activity
We CANNOT FIX HER... I repeat... We CANNOT FIX HER...
Azula was the LIVING EMBODIMENT of tweakin of a perc 30 ☠️
When the world needed him most, he pulled up..
Azula was that bitch before she went crazy she should’ve been the final villain
I'd still hit
Cj slades ass should’ve been here first 💀
From pampered princess to mad queen.
Cj came in clutch with Avatar Uncut....
Amos 5 verse 14 Seek good, not evil, that you may live. Then the LORD God Almighty will be with you, just as you say he is.
My boy CJ drop a video let's go 🎉
for a 2nd i thought this was a Round Table Trial like "wait, we're letting unhinged crackheads on the table?" i mean, Tanya is an unhinged crackhead, but at least she's got brain cells
Ay yo CJdo the new episodes of baki bro
King CJ knew what we want😂❤️‍🔥
I agree bro😢😢 her rizz is horrible
Great new series, please keep em coming
Speaking of the round table of black air force.........um Where Is Kratos.  He must have his Doobie Bro.
Oh this series is going to be fun!
Alright, I guess YouTube felt the need to unsubscribe me from CJ. Almost didn't catch this if it wasn't for the recommended.
She's crazy but I can fix her
Bro just keeps uploading banger after banger keep it up bro❤️💯
16:40 Whatchu mean no rizz? I use that line on the regular degular
AYO HOMIE GOT POP TATE
I'm definitely adding Azula to my "Characters who carry shows." video.
Yo Yoshikage Kira needs to be #005. You know, because hands have five fingers
Azula was off of mad perks my G, not even God can fine her! 🥲🤣🤣
We need Esdeath on this new series. Her, and the shrine girl from Higurashi
Pvz gw ost was hitting in this one
Its been a minute
We’ve been waiting and he finally delivered
Much like majin buu is the president of the round tavle of black air force activity i have to ask,    Who would be classified as patient 0. The one who started it all. The character that has even the the most deviously visious characters thinking "this bitch is insane."
Today was a bad day, now its good in the hood.
It took a month but finally he uploads, I feel like gojo floating when he fights against toji after gojo died
Okay that was 🔥 🔥 I'm ready to see who else is in The Asylum 👀👀. Cuz I know a couple mofos that need to be in there ‼️
The asylum I’m gonna like this new series
Fire nation city girls is funny asl lmao
🎉🎉🎉
Where have u been brooo
I would say that you should add johan liebert from monster to the asylum but he would honestly find a way to escape or take over the whole asylum
Can we all just think about the fact that this girl azula is a 14 year old psychopath
Azula is the result of daddy and mommy issue🤣🤣 Years of pain, hatred and insanity.
What will it take to get Jiren on the roundtable
16:49 I PHYSICALLY fell on the floor from that
Azula is the definition of why you should be an only child, cuz you'll just get paired with an absolute menace
One of the sequel comics has them try to reintegrate this ho back into society and shes so full blown paranoid schizophrenic that they do no know if she can be trusted to not kill people
We need more 💯
New CJ content? We eating good
OMG PLEASE DO JUNKO ENOSHIMA NEXT
Azula got the black air forces
Joker 2019 next?
That Shadows of Evil music at the end was well used
THAT NINJA IS CRAZY - he said in RDC Mark
And it pisses me off that they trying to “redeem her” in the comics…like tf
W theme song, Outr
10/10 series I recommend Sephiroth as patient two!
Oh yes, a welcomed video about Azula😎👍
I am now waiting on disrespectful  moments JJK edition with this new season
AYO NEW SERIES, lets fucken go
all I have to say is..........FINALLY!!!!!!!!❤
When the hood needed him most... He returned.
He's back!!! 🎉 🎉 👏 WOOOOHOOOOO
I am hyped for this new cj dachamp series
Not the fire nation city girl 😂😂😂 7:00
I never thought to imagine that there characters out there that our too intense for the Roundtable, but absolute psychos like Azula found a way!
I'm guessing the next one in the asylum is carnage
This plan is brilliant Cj
She may be crazy but Azula still hot tho
Love it!! CJ is a the champ for doing these!! (See what I did there) Love your material CJ!!
What’s even crazier about Azula is the fact that she is only 14! This a freaking middle schooler doing this shit. Man when I was 14 the only thing I was worried about is if my parents were ever going to get me an iPhone and catching a certain virus.
you should do one about simon from infinity train.  that nigga was only there for a season bro was crazy crazy
Oh shit!!!
DJ her taking out Aang was far worse. She didnt just put him in a coma she straight up killed him
She’s SO dangerous and cracked that she’s NOT ALLOWED to be a black air force! Our boi CJ had to come up with a WHOLE OTHER SERIES to deal with people of her category!
Azula was on straight demon time   nothing could stop her  then again the whole fire nation royal has been little crazy then she was smiling when zuko got burned by his father nah she definitely crazy
I love this please do more of this
It’s orochimaru gonna be on this list?
Hey could you go over the lich king please. Because he IS the flex. He doesn't need to Because he knows thyself
She should be at the round table
You know who gotta be next, Junko Enoshima from Danganropa i gotta see that
Halloween special from CJ..today is a great day  Also I always hated how she treated Ty Lee. She was way too toxic to her for no reason
Love the new series, and you talking about Avatar was awesome as hell too
(16:57) this part got me so damn good 🤣🤣🤣🤣 love your vids man
First, give it up for Grey Delisle Griffin. This was a VA TOUR DE FORCE. Much of the time the Avatar crew looked for kids to play the roles. They made an exception for her and now you see why. For my anime brethren, when they talk about VA royalty. You can have your favs, but even they nod their head in the direction of S+ tier like Grey. Second, what made this villain so  delicious was it's like every Mean Girl you encounter from 6 grade and up. This is the perfect foil for a group of teen heroes. Ozai is bad but it's like Luke fighting Palpatine not really the main event. Azula had been serving up Ls the whole series. No telling how this might play out. That is how you villain.
Azula is who zoku thought he was when he was chasing the avatar 😂.
WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THE NEW JJK SEASON
I gotta know the song at 7:52
....Nice. New series is on þe run!
Ayo CJ you better lock up Baki’s goofy ahh mom in there
"I can fix her"
Azula was using chidori I smell copyright
Listen bobo😂😂
this series boutta be hard asf🔥
This is an example of: if I were a therapist I would rather have an appointment with joker than azula, I know what to expect of joker he gonna make up some shit or use me for some fucked up plan but azula that's a mess I don't want to deal with, lock her up throw away the key she cannot be helped
These videos make my day
Bruh I was rewatching all the other vids waiting like “come on CJ it’s been a month bro.” And little did I know CJ had another banger waiting like 2 hours later
Nah I'm crying 😭 17:32
finally the video that we deserved!
Can you do jack hanma from baki next?
Finally a new video
We need Accelerator from a certain magical index on the round table Maniac blows up truck-kun on MULTIPLE OCCASIONS and even climaxes during one of them Come to think of it we probably need him here too
16:40 I would have been like, "You're lookin' hot, Azula! Careful, if you go to either of the Water Tribes, you could evaporate all the water, leaving several inexperienced Waterbenders without any means of self-defense! Because you're so HOT!"
Azula exudes black AF Energy 🔥
🐐 Drop !!
What a start to a brand new series! We're about to see some of the CRAZIEST characters in cartoon history down the line after seeing Azula's crazy antics!
my sister is exactly like azula in insanity and i basically relived every insane shit she did through this show
Dam
can u (Cj Dachamp) make a sepret yt channle where you have the same vids but not say the n-word i realy dont like it. or one where u censor it so my brain can fill in other words im not the type of guy to be sensitive to curse words but i dont like the n-word i get anziety thinking im going to accidently say it and thinking that makes me feel more angziety making me make alot of slight mistakes making me feel like im going to make a mistake in my wording thinking not to say the n-word then trying to continyu what i was saying then think of trying not to say the n-wrord then accidently saying it i hate the feeling (sry for the bad spelling. spelling is wierd)
I'm just glad to hear he's alive
WELL WELL WELL
Yk when bro post it’s game time
Damn
Junko, with everything she did in Danganronpa, is a PRIME case for The Asylum. Junko’s case here is gonna be a treat to see when it drops. Absolute banger content CJ. Keep up the great work
I'm ALL HERE for your version of a review. Keep it up, man.  You're great
Where the hell you been CJ DaChamp…… AVATAR is a 🐐 Show
How you a whole ass Princess and still have negative Rizz
Most hated character in Avatar took a L and started crying.
Great video
I love me a crazy badass woman who can manipulate blue flames
ngl I have never seen a better summary of any piece of media ever
WE ARE UP! 🦅🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣💯
11:42 Is that riley
Okay I’m sorry but Gogeta needs to be at the round table. Man is a savage. Basically wins almost every fight he’s ever been in. Has the craziest moves. And is a stone cold bad ass every time.
We need a Black air force vid on  namek Vegeta/Majin Vegeta these are were vegeta's demonic nature spiked
Ok ik azula is super crazy but..hear me out..just just..hear me out 😂
I can fix her
Do joker after Azula
CJ, what about Brook Samson (The Venture Bros.)?
CJ needs to do a video on Black Beetle from Young Justice. Dude was a fucking MENACE
this new series 🔥
Azula was so nice with the boxing she had to literally go insane for mfs to feel enough self confidence to MAYBE beat her 😭
Attacking the MC while he’s transforming is utterly DEVIOUS behavior
I can fix her
He's back 🔥🔥
This the one not even Martian Manhunter could fix, she close to the most insane in the roundtable if she was kept there instead.
0:58 CJ needs to make a vid on Yoshikage Kira now
I cant wait to see where this goes but also i need to see someone like you philly codenamesuper someone talk about the fight with leon in pokemon because its just amazing
Do yoshikage and Junko also nagito and juuzou suzuya
There is one man who rules the Asylum:  *Hisoka*
EYYYY ✅👌was waitin for this one the princess of menaces 👸🔥
Honestly it makes you question if Zuko is even deserving of the position of main rival antagonist after how he was treated by a his lovely sister.😹
Excuse me, that's the first level? Oh, I'm not going through this shit!
Wow
She is the only character that has me disturbed
Joker is next or you are on some shit
THE TOXIC QUEEN
Do kenpachi
missed you papi
The TF2 Medic has to get a reference in one of these videos.
We need a video on Junko lmao
This couldn’t have been a more perfect time and i just got me some Chinese food im bouttah enjoy this
7:56 i love black ppl sfx 😂   8:27.   10:40
HE FUCKING DID ITTTTTTT
9:05 aye aang was like hell naw ,😂 I remember this episode to the T
you ever wonder what happened to the guy who announced that zuko and iroh was prisoners. We never saw jit again
Yay he's back with another master peace,this is the black Shakespeare,glockspeare
I feel bad for that captain tho...☠️☠️
Nah CJ you best put Doffy on this series, that dude crazy as hell
Omg "When they cry" is WILD!!!!
Brand new series W
Weird ass timing nigga,was just saying that you haven't posted in a bit and now there's a new vid. Are you in my walls gang 😂
She's Bae ... Nough said 😍
From riches to rags.
Azula has always been one of my favorite characters in ATLA and  the fact that she started off as a formidable foe yet deteriorated into a mental wreck always irked me 😟
CJ UPLOAD
I like this new serie😂😂😂
WE CAN NOT FIX HER, I REPEAT, WE CAN NOT FIX HER!
DOpe start to the series. azula def the founder of the insane victims fasho
Avatar has some of the best character building and stories in a cartoon ever. Like zuko azula and iroh are such layered characters for a kids show.
What is this I smell. Cj Cocking up another banger of a Video with an Amazing Idea of a Video format Gawd damn
Ay, she still hot tho             I'm also a minor for context.
Can we get a trial for zaheer? (Ausmming you've seen korra)
Bro reviewing my queen 😍😭
The title of this is so fitting for her
This is fire
ozies angels needs a spinoff
Yes finally bro came back yes
Bruh what was that 16:59
Early fr
Cj don't miss
The Asylum looking like a very promising yet chaotic series we gonna be seeing.
Since we doing avatar, all the villains from korra except that MF dark avatar should have a video
She belong to the sreats
Azula was one of the reasons my taste in women is trash cuz them crazy girls make me go crazy.
21:20 She got herself looking like Bellatrix Lestrange.
OH YUH. This is a cool AF concept.
I love Azula. Such a great start to this new series. One of the most standout things about her is just how fucking mean-spirited she is. It makes her an absolute delight to watch and even in the end you realize she's just the sad kinda crazy.
I can fix her           But honestly Ty Lee's better so why would I ?
Every guy in my school was down bad for her crazy ass back in the day one of the Original I can fix her meme.
This woman is the reason why this place was built….. Let that sink in!
She needs to be in the round table as well.
It’s been a good minute since we had a girl in the court of me menaces
Now that I think about it Azula for mortal Kombat when?
Bro killin it fr fr
We love you CJ
Do joker ( don't forget to mention that screen from the red hood movie where joker kills a man with a cup )
looking forward to seeing more of this
The best video ever 🎉
Kids nowadays will never truly understand the peak that was Avatar: The Last Airbenders. Im not even old yet...
This series finna go hard🔥
Shoutout to Grey DeLisle for giving a god like performance with Azula. She said her performance with her “talking to her mom” in the mirror and the mental breakdown scene after VS Katara was using her dark and painful thoughts from her past she uses. And doesn’t wanna do or watch this two scenes ever….  (Fun fact, she is Mandy from Grim Adventures, Sam from Danny Phantom, Catwoman, Vicky from FOP and Daphne…..)
Bro CJ once i heard about the asylum i was like WWWWHHHHOOOO THE PSYCHO SECTION YES FINALLY
Youtube is going hard on the ads these days.  I got hit with 8 of those fuckers in this video.
Azula belongs on a special tier of villain, where not only does she technically succeed in killing the protagonist, but every single time the protagonist and his friends fight her, they lose and have to find a way to escape.  Zuko even makes it very clear that the only reason he and Katara could face her was because her growing insanity made her so unstable that she was starting to go berserk and not think straight anymore, a calm Azula would've stomped them both. Hell, the crazed Azula nearly took them both down anyway.
Finally u add her
Yo can we get Makima on either the round table or the asylm cause she is downright a fucking crazy ass menace
i use to watch this show all the time it is good i watch it over like 20 25 times but you good vid tho
Everyone commenting paragraphs all I wanna say the champ is back again w
I woke up after my 10,00 year nap for this shit bro…
is it js me that had a lesbian crush on mei
Brooooo we needed this!!!
Get Vegeta off the table. He got too many instances of being a fraud
i feel like azula should be at the round table and the asylum
42 MINUTES GANG WHERE YOU AT??!?!
Mom: Why don’t you ever go play with neighbors kid? They seem nice.  The neighbors kid:  Homegirl is the pinnacle of youngest child syndrome.
Really loving this new series, but I gotta say there is one person who needs to be here... MONKEY D LUFFY He starts the manga stabbing himself in the face to show how manly he was to pirates and it only gets crazier from there.
I love what your doing keep cooking
Bro if we don’t get a Vilgax video I wouldn’t care but I think it would be fire
first it was cj the judge now its dr cj nefario
Yoooo it’s a golden day when CJ uploads!
Nah don't disrespect Katara like she ain't beat Azula ass in Ba sing se and ZUKO had to save her lil ass 💀 she was getting cooked   But yeah this bitch crazy
She ain’t insane cause she could walk instead of being carried. She insane cause could walk instead of being carried WHILE ON A BOAT
My moms favorite character is Azula I remember watching an episode where i think the Dai Li (Ba Singh Sei's secret police) where she says "Dont Flatter Yourself"   My mother said with a face so stone cold "That's me, Thats my favorite character!" She was so stoked, I dont think ive ever seen her so excited as the episode continued, and i liked the show too! I thought We finally bonded over something!  We do NOT have a relationship today 😅😅
Zuko and Azula, a perfect example of a stable Fire-Nation royal siblings relationship since Zoryu and his brother, Cheajin, or Sozin and his sister, Zeisan.
ah yes. S A L A M A N D E R.
YESSIR!!! Welcome back my brother! And thank you as always for all this masterpiece content you make. Now do Sakura Haruno next 🙌🤣🍿
I need 5 Kage summit Sasuke locked up in the G-building
Azula is the kind of villain that I feel pity for.
Cj always manages to make me laugh 😂😂😂
Bro, its finally time... THE G HIMSELF HAS RETURNED!!!🔥     After 1 month... 💀
It’s a lot of YT channels biting off you but them mfs lame asl n not funny😭💯
We still waiting for Shredder 💀
20:24 Azula wielding the ban hammer like she’s Thor with Mjolnir.
Azula crazy ass my favorite character of the show
Who next in the asylum joker
It only gets worse in the comics that are a canonical in-between for the show--acting as the fourth season of ATLA where Asula LITERALLY BECOMES A CULT LEADER AND KIDNAPS CHILDREN AND THEN MANIPULATES ZUKO AGAIN
Uploaded 50 minutes ago and theres already 40k views, sheesh
Yo cj
Who been watchin cjdachamp since his TikTok compilations?☝🏾
Damn now you definitely gotta put light from death note in here. But the vid was 🔥🔥🔥🔥 as always keep up the good work man
Long Feng: “I apologize for my outburst”.  Azula: “You are not him”.  Hollering🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Manga gets worse
Man you need to put orochimaru in there star
Feels good to see cj upload again
She’s my favorite character of the show
Love your content and yeah she is crazy lol.
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
If Revi the queen of black Air Force energy Azula the princess 👑 💀
This was very fresh and entertaining I'm really looking forward to our next trip to the asylum.  Never thought I'd say that.
Your love of toxic women started when you chose Azula over Ty Lee and let’s be honest here. If Avatar: The Last Airbender was a musical, Azula would have THE BEST SONG.
I’d smash tho
Crazy b****😂😂
While i may have hated Ty lee, what  Azula did to Ty lee was DEVIOUS
Azula is the reason why I'm into Japanese women
Finallyyyyyy a month feels like a year
I jump off my bed after I saw he upload 💀
this nigga did azula before shreder
Let get a Hell yeah
Finally some AlA content
One way to ruin my childhood lmfao🤣. W video.
I'm from Philly  so that " Naww nigga you pussy" hit different 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yoooooooooo
CJ da Goat 🐐 has returned!!!!
Everybody Assemble CJ droped📢📢📢📢
HOLY FUCKING SHIT  FINALLY  CJ DACHAMP UPLOADS  anyway new fucking series!?!?  keep up the work big buddy
Hell yeah, new cj vid and it’s atla. I’m being fed good today
SHE IS A SHE-DEMON!! She was smiling when Zuko got his left eye burned by his own father during an Agni Kai. She deserves to be defeated by Katara
W video cj the  champ
Azula was a lot of people's for different reasons.
shredder please cj the champion
Another prime candidate for the Asylum would be Albedo Piazzola from Xenosaga. The attempts of censoring him in the game only made him look more unhinged.
You should do orochimaru creepy ass
And the sanity meter? Yeah. Azula can’t be measured on that either lmao
Goddammit Ozai, one huge could've calm Azula down.
A new series this is interesting cj you did thing again
The G.O.A.T has released another series
Insane ass
I like how you do get a glimps of Azula actually liking her friends . From apologizing for being jealous. To opening up to the lm at the camp fire .  A pity for her future though
Oh….oh yeah. This is gonna be great. This is a fantastic introduction to characters who are absolutely insane. Starting off with someone whose own voices in her head are telling her she needs help…yeah solid entry. I cannot wait to see who else gets added. Personally I’m voting for Jinx from Arcane. That girl is an entire dissertation on mental illness and the importance of psychological support.
Man Cj make another disrespectful moment bruuuuu I need it but you my boy so I let it slide
14:24 why aang got female parts on 😂
Sid from eminence of the shadow is just a menace to please do a video on him
I guess I gotta watch Avatar now 😂
The new series is really going to be the definition of insanity. I could tell a few patients who fit the bill here. Azula is one of them to go from daddy's ruthless princess to a deranged psycho with issues.
About Time Bro
1:00 the minute I saw asylum I knew she would be here. Junko is so insane that her projected sentence makes what you’d give light yagami or anyone else look like a joke
I see that, like the Nux, you have purposely sped up some parts of the video in editing to (probably) avoid the wrath of greedy bitches (AKA: copyright holders and fakers). Wait, that was me being stupid.
Yes
today my birthday :)
Ain't no way this man is about to cover junko and honestly I would put azula 2 or 3 because she's crazy but not that crazy
Keep in mind she 14 and she that much as a monster.
❤❤😂
I'm liking this series already. Makiam and Gojo are pretty insane
That boy getting bussiue never mind she getting rizzy
Now that CJ busted out the asylum, how many till he does the joker
No matter who Azula fights, she got that DAWG in her.
You think The Roundtable checks on The Asylum every now and then for potential new members?
One of my favourite characters tbh, her fall was one of the best I’ve seen.
I can fix her
Can we just talk about how aang  just straight up no diff fire lord
Welp it’s abt time
You know when you need insanity you start playing Sander Cohen's greatest hits! Time to move on from Black Air forces to straight jackets.
Not gona lie this new series is very goood i can see many other characters in the asylum maybe even yuno gasai and light yagami
HE’S BACK AGAIN!!!!!
My friend father got a better track record of showing up more than CJ
I just started watching you videos two days ago and finished watching all your great videos.
I wonder how many characters are going to be here should we just put light in maximum security right now
Before 50k claim it💯🔥
everyone knew that she was going to be crazy since we first saw her😂😂
This is a good one
CJDachamp's Asylum Candidates: - Ryusei Shidou (Blue Lock) - Kiryu Setsuna (Kengan Ashura) - Hisoka (Hunter x Hunter) - Hama (Avatar) - David Martinez (Cyberpunk 2077: EdgeRunners)
put her in the black tims catagory
Shadow pls
CJ be chillin in the prison realm between vids fr
Can you try Char Az able from MS Gundam
she carried this show on her lunatics shoulders! best character of the show
New series, still heat 🔥🔥🔥
Sealed Ground for the chase scene with Aang was PERFECT.  I aint know CJ was chill like that, bro stay using Sonic Rider songs
LETS GOO
I don't like azula at all I can't stand bullies
Bruh he back now butt late Asf?
She was off a perk since birth bro
CJ HAS A NEW VIDEOO!! 💯💯🗣🗣
She took ang out in his strongest form 😂 with no remorse Azula was wylin her ass off and mad hatin The bitch is insane 😂
I’d watch a whole DBZA like series just with CJ voicing ATLA    Also petition to put people from the BAF round table that are also insane like Roberta in the Asylum too
This series is perfect
You know the girl lost it when she went after her PERFECT BANGS
You need accelerator in this bih.
Yay Cjdachamp uploaded just in time
Had to double check who posted because I KNOW CJ Dachamp don’t post this often 🌶🥛🐌
Orochimoro next
I love you cj.
I love how Cj is legitimately creating his own Hood Anime Universe. First he pulled up with the BAFA-Roundtable, Now the asylum, next he’ll probably come up with the Church of the Anime-GOATs dedicated to all the Godliest dudes in all of anime like Gojo, Luffy, & All Might.
𝐶𝐽 ✊🏾🤣🤣
𝐶𝐽 ✊🏾🤣🤣
𝐶𝐽 ✊🏾🤣🤣
𝐶𝐽 ✊🏾🤣🤣
Bro I swear if he did comics carnage would be number 1
I literally got excited when I say a new video
DJ! DJ! DJ! DJ! DJ! DJ! HE UPLOADED
Azula my goat
WE REACHING BEYOND THE DEEPEST LAYER OF HELL WITH THIS AUSLMY🗣🔥🔥🔥
7:11 That looking like the Tinder app logo 💀
Well, since he's in the intro, I look forward to your inevitable episode on Mark Hamill's Joker.
What's wrong with loving hands dawg , y'all just hating
Azula's rizz was so trash CJ had to show his IRL disappointment
🔥🔥🔥
𝐶𝐽 ✊🏾🤣🤣
YOU MADE A VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?!!?!!!!!!!!!!!?!?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I can fix her.
CJ BACK
I really like the concept of this new series. Here's hoping for a Jinx video.
Azula is one of the most insane mfs ive ever witnessed in childhood man 😅
idek why u bothered she gon break out wht u gonna do stop her? shiit lol
14:24 PAUSE RUN THAT AANG PIC BACK
🤓 actually the picture you used was of an axolotl not a salamander🤓  (W vid btw)
It’s a
PLEASE continue this series!
At when he said asylum I instantly liked
Bruh!!!!!! great series i never never ever ever ever miss ur series dude... shout out from Trinidad and Tobago!
The scariest about the aang avatar scene is that if katara used the water on zuko and not aang, Azula would’ve killed the entire avatar cycle, and it would have restarted with korra.
Now this is a classic
joker up next
Damn 1k views a min dis shit bussin😂🎉🎉
Patient #0001 is a classic case of the crazies
I'd still hit tho
Bruh I haven't seen this show in so long but God damn I didn't know she was like That   but if we doing people that then i say raian from kegan ashura cause  that Nigga was just bulit different lmao 💀🤣
I love how it wasn't Iroh or Zuko that discovered Azula was lying. It was a freaking slip of the tongue by a captain. Forget being thrown overboard, my man was used as lightning practice!
I want azula to step on me like the sand castle
I never realized how genuinely crazy azula was until i watched this video 😭😭😭😭
I want to see more jumping  🎉
new series is hype
Ty lee did an ENTIRE BACK FLIP AS A CHILD seems pretty fair for Azula to cry
these 1 Months upload is crazy
Yoo
30 MIN GANG
Azula built like a literal batman villain 😂
Most people in an asylum are a danger to themselves. They are more likely to be victims of violence rather than perpetrators. Azula isn't insane. She is a narrasistic asshole.
crazy im in the process of rewatching the avatar
I’m waiting for shredder from 03 version from tmnt
Top tier 🙌🏾
Yerrrrrr
All I can say for Azula is this: “From the streets did she emerge, and to the streets she shall return.” Latom 🙏🏾
I’m gonna keep asking for it: Worlds end harem
Bro I love azula, but man is she is fucking crazy
I can fix her
NEVER BEEN SO EARLY MAH BOI YOU BACK BIIISH
37 mins bro did almost 30k!!!!!!
NAME 6:49
16:32 Nah that Rizz is AWFUL😂😂😂😂
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
You know its a good day when CJ posts a vid
Fun Fact: Azula actually got mental treatment therefore was released and ended up starting a family with someone from the Earth tribe.. but unfortunately was never release it was scraped..
It was only a matter of time till Azusa was covered. But I never imagined it so soon
When will bro do a Ayanokoji video I need one
thank god she's getting redeemed in the comics cause god damn bro 🤣
Haven't clicked on anything so quick like this in a long time. Welcome back CJ!
yeah  I did feel bad for her but at the end of the day she has lost her marbles 💀 💀💀 LMAO
Finally I’ve been waiting CJ
Lol
HOOO HOOO HOO! I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE!
I'm sorry but the Thomas the tank engine music killed me
I was just looking at you're channel an hour ago to see if you would upload 💯
Amazing vid, the BO3 Shadoes of evil game over music sold the whole video. Made me shed one fr😢
High on life reference is crazy
THE INTRO WAS TOP TIER
CJ is back
Psalm 9 verse 9  The LORD is a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble.
I expect to see Betelgeuese. That is all.
Hell yeah new series for us to watch some crazies!
azula is the goat
Plz do the tmnt 2003 shredder he is on some timing
the Shadows of Evil music at the end was perfect. I wanna see the Roundtable and Asylum members and patients come together where a member of both will get a special episode. This was amazing.
i could get use to this new series
I’ve been waiting years for a new video, thank you.
Yoooo this series finna be WiLd
It's been a while since I last saw Avatar and I never really finished the second half of the show but *GOD DAMN* she an even crazier hoe than I heard others say about her
Finally lmao nah I certainly love bro content 💯
brazil
early
you gotta do a kenpachi video
I must say unlike all the other channels that do similar content, you actually have class with your cuts, and arent just repeating the same ten images every single video to show your reaction. You find some shit iv never seen lol
She on the motherfucking black suit in Spider-Man shit
I have so many words for this video, but due to waiting on a ATLA video so some years all I can say is RAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH LETS FUCKIN GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Love this video man keep it up🤗😭
Bro Azulas rizz was so bad that Cj showed us that even he was he like  “really n!&&@!”☠️
MY GOAT UPLOADED!
I hope this series continues
13:00 Long Feng: You've beaten me at my own game. Azula: Don't flatter yourself, you were never even a player. One of the coldest lines I've ever heard.
Bro cj is the best yt when it comes to doing this like explaining characters swear
I already got one bitch in mind that needs to have an asylum episode and that's Seryu Ubiquitous.
Frist Omni-Man then Slade now Azula. I wonder who is next.
Can we rename level 5 to Chrisean Rock?
Bro just watching Azula through this vid had me contemplating about life in general cause damn, her ass is legit INSANE!!! By the way CJ, lovin this start of this series. Keep up the great work man God bless you 👍
“ 1 hour gang ⬇️” 🤓🤓
Can’t do this series without that nigga off soul eater 😭
This is hilarious as heck, dude. Fun fact: 'Long Feng's' Voice Actor is Clancy Brown/aka/Mr. Krabs from 'Spongebob'.  And the Servant Girl, who gave Azula that un-pitted cherry, was non other than the SAME Voice Actress for Azula! Grey Delisle!
Bro 15:57 remember Azula is gay
When that Kenpachi vid dropping?
Oh so this is what this boy CJ been cookin up🔥🔥🔥
Water:
Can we talk about how Katara carried Aang in the fight in the crystal kove, she had Azula tamed and looked ready to take on the Dai Lee by herself and revived the Avatar from death, mad respect for her
Can’t wait to see the rest of the crazies.
14:06 wait hold up Azula broke the transformation rule  Goku: Azula we dont do that and also I heard your pretty strong 😂
Can't wait to see what other crazy n!ggas will be thrown in here.
idk man...I mean I can fix her.
So dr. Cj ,who is the next patient ?
I love the Garden Warfare music! Yet another banger, keep up the good work👍
Finally😭😭😭
So I guess I’ll be the one to say it, will Griffith be a patient in the asylum or nah???
Azula always had the same level of hate as Ruckus's racism but focused solely on Zuko....
CJ. You opened the floodgates here and I've got a lot of thoughts on who could be joining Azula in the Asylum, thank you SO MUCH for making this series.
This was such a throwback bruh...  Azula was NO JOKE
They don't call the nigga DACHAMP for nothing🗣🗣‼️‼️🔥🔥🔥🔥
Azula dead beat the breaks off of everyone on the Gaang at least once.  She had Iroh shook, IROH didn't even wanna fight that crazy chick, she was her forreal
so if azula is the cause for this series....how long will it take for  Gasai yuno to appear?......
Let me get my food. CJ dropped another video.
Cj is back with another hit. Azula was a goat for real she was ready to give anybody the hands 🔥 🔥
All of Kakegurui should be in assylum
would smash
I WANTED to feel bad for Azula but she makes that IMPOSSIBLE. Man oh man. This one's a GOOD one. 👍
Who do you think would win? Azula or Ozai? My money's on crazy but the show never made it quite clear if he's stronger than her.
At least someone notices Azula besides hent*I artists. TY and I love the new asylum tech your doing.
Peeps say first when the video comes out. But I am the first to say first after finisbing the video. We are not the same.
I've been looking forward to this
You gotta read the Avatar comics where the gang finally finds Zuko's mom and the first thing Azula tries to do is run the fade.
W intro an hopefully new series 😁
To sum up the asylum its were characters were filled with so much black air force activity they couldn't be sat at the table because they wanted the smoke with EVERYONE and EVERYTHING which made them a danger to the already menaces there but these characters........ Couldn't keep the DAWG in them
sad and all but COULDNT BE MEEEEEE LOLLLLLL
Second
Azula broke the first rule of anime.... buggin
Do amon from Korra because um...
I can save her
'Till this day, i do not understand what the azula simps see in her. Actually psycho straight out of the womb
damn Azusa cooked bro
Bro I’m only a minute in and I’m am hyped I’m loving the asylum already
FINALLY CJ AZULA
Oh yeah so so down for this new segment, keep ‘em Coming cj
I love the new series. It's not for cold, beast mode 24/7 mfs. It's for plain old crazy mfs who don't just need to be locked up but have the entire prison built around then for just them like Tai lung from ku fu panda😂
Bruh you always come through with an upload when my day has been crap. Much appreciated!
As Soon As I Saw The Notification For This Video I Clicked Immediately Because Azula Is Crazy And ATLA(Avatar The Last Airbender) Is One Of The Best Shows Nickelodeon Has Ever Put Out. Great Breakdown Of Azula Bro It Was Amazing.
If Junko is gonna be in this series, Nagito has got to be as well
Dam cj my nigga u having the craziest people in here?!😂
nice this vid looks interesting was waiting thanks Edit: naaa shits crazy she is on every type of drugs
That boy miles must of learned his electricity powers from azula or something because that boy be frying people in spiderman 2 🤣
The asylum already starting off insane
Every time I see a new video from you im guaranteed both a lot of laughs and immediate disappointment (because of the fact that it's a long wait before the next (not to rush u though because its WELL worth it!! Keep it up brody 🤟🏿😎🤟🏿))
A new series based on characters who either are or have gone completely insane, huh? If you ever decide to cover Redo Of Healer's true main antagonist (a.k.a. Keyaru) on The Asylum, whatever you do, please please please PLEASE DON'T USE HIS DEATH ROW INMATE LAUGH AS THE THUMBNAIL!!        _I've been mentally scarred by that traumatizing mugshot more times than I can count already..._ 😱😱😱
She had a green goblin style meltdown at the end lol
Hey can you talk about shredder
So huey was the first ti flame a ball does that make azula the sec and i mean for cartoons not anime well we both know, i call these sub animes tbh
I sentence her to 3 weeks with Whitebeard(before death) and 2 weeks with Kaido
Azula was the type of girl 10yo me saw and thought "I could fix her" but in reality everything that's wrong about her makes her 10x more attractive.
We need more parts
It about got damn man you posted 🤬🤬
After a long Damn time,finally...the man itselft came again,ladies and gentlemen......Cjesus Dachamp returned 🚬🗿
So esdeath when?
Bro you gotta do an episode about Carnage, because this new series is not an asylum without Carnage being in one of these videos! Btw you’re a GOAT CJ.
My boi just dropped😂oh yea it’s lit
Oh hell yea
This series is gonna cook
I would say Mai was more bored than scared of Azula
W vid but Azula was on smth whole show ima keep it a buck she is on many things yet to be named like Avatar Kush or smth like that
my nigga this series finna be heat
She just needed a good man to love her and she would of calmed down 😂
The character development on this show is fucking god tier and also some characters devolvement was crazy to witness as well; Azula went from a powerful, collected and calculated  princess to some crackhead writhing around in the fire lords palace.
I can fix her...
Cj imma need to see toji join that table
Ok hear me out orochimaro can't spell but I rest my case
L
DROP EVERYTHING Y'ALL! NEW CJDACHAMP VIDEO!! 🎉
Yes! I've been waiting for this one!  9:20: This episode was crazy!
I cannot verbally explain how long I’ve been waiting for CJ to do a video on avatar the last airbender
Bro azulas insanity peak in the agnai kai actually got me creeped out as a kid like that crap made me uncomfortable
W new series
wsg cj keep it up man your content is prefection
Bro I love you for posting this.
I hope we get and ezdeath episode
I have a strong feeling that, like the roundtable of menaces being all men, this asylum would be mostly women 💀
Ok kira needs to go in he gets turn on by hands not that you know but hands boy on a perk thirty
I’m loving this series so far it’s amazing. P.S I would honesty smash azula even thought she has bad rizz and did some messed up things.
I’d still smash Azula shorty tufff 😭
Azula actually killed Aang but Katara revived him with her healing water. So technically Azula earned the title of protagonist killer
Sad to say her rizz worked on me
earliest i ever been for a drop
YOOOOOOOOOO
Yoooo cj thanks for the awesome video
Thank you, you don't miss bruh😂
Yooo
Bro I can’t wait for junko
Fine I’ll go back and watch the show for like the millionth time
Sir DaChamp great episode keep it up 🧐
Aamg def gone need that rematch from  Azula me personally I wouldnt let that disrespect slide
the final agni kai....classic
22:44  BRUH! The way that N-bomb synced with the animation killed me 😂😂😂
I'm not gonna lie, it's hard to not feel sorry for Azula considering at the end of the day, she's an emotionally and mentally damaged 14 year old girl.
Cj DOES NOT MISS!!!
Azula belongs to the streets
Was this place made to hold Pickle?
He’s gotta do an episode on vilgax from Ben 10 that alien is a menace 😂 💀
May be crazy but here me out 😈
Can u do naz unleash plzzz
Out of pocket avatar video? I’m hungry so what’s cookin
This is 🔥🔥🔥cj THE ASYLUM
Azula was a true ride and die just crazy asf ❤❤❤❤
i love your videos they are great
azula did nothing wrong
Bro why u always tooo long to upload 😭
Aizen deserves to be at the round table, but yes, put azula aka 001  where she rightly belongs
Azula the  villains we all love
YEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHH!
What’s good cj
MOM WAKE UP NEW CJ DACHAMP VIDEO JUST DROPPED
1st 30 mins bro
They had to nerf Azula for Zuko to win
Under an hour gang👇
Absolutely love this idea. And we need you to do the grandaddy Clown Prince of Crime aka joker.
Crazy thing is, in a comic she went with Zuko to find their mom JUST SO SHE CAN KILL HER MOM HERSELF
stand on bisni
BRUH I did not expect you to make a video on Azula but my god I'm so happy that you did😂😂
Here is how insane that guard scene is that wasn't supposed to be in the show that was actually a audition scene in real life and it was so good they put it in the show anyway
Like it my guy lol
You done with college? And ain't no way they got bro in the dr nefarious fit😂
16:51 Nah why bro be looking like that cuh😅😂😂
4.8k likes in 21 mins bro you a celebraty
Gotta put Accelerator in the asylum.
Oh boy I didn’t see this one coming
Soooo..... Are we gonna See Kefka in The Asylum?
He's back! 🗣️🔥
Expecting a bunch of Yandere characters to be in the asylum series
Fighting your hair as if it has feelings just cause you can’t put it up yourself is Joker-level madness ngl
It's about that time!
2:57 we not talking abt how Cj perfectly lipsynced with Zuko? That shit got me rolling
I'd still fuq
Naw this new series is kinda heat you're do great things man
8:34 I'm bout to blow
Question: if people like DIO, Roberta and Kid Buu only managed to be on the JURY of the R.T.O.B.A.F.A, then what the hell did CJ do to become JUDGE?
I can save her
to all the guys/gals who think they have no rizz, just remember that azula exists 16:41
Only If you like DJ, the champion like this comment
The fact that there are people saying Azula deserves redemption is goddamn Insanity because of the shit she has done should tell you that people like her can't be redeemed whatsoever.
My guy said " you know the show hasn't ended if mc is not dead until Korra" dam 😅
True CJ fans that watched this in less than a hour?:
When CJ tweeted that he was posting tonight, the last thing I expected was not only a new series but AZULA TOO?!?
azula sexy asl, never failed to make it go up
Genderbent Dabi put in work on gang.
Cj D. Goat
Can do a trial on junko enoshima
I get a hard on everytime Cj Dachamp uploads a new video
😂❤
I know the Gasai Yuno episode coming soon haha she might be level 5
Ohhhh imma love this new series!
I honestly don’t really like how she went from cool calm and calculated while clearly still unhinged to a complete mental shattering so quickly with no transition
CJ love your videos man !  PEAK ENTERTAINMENT
Yo! If we're going to crazy characters then may I suggest Raul from the massacre of a vengeful hero. It's only manga but the shit this man does made redo of healer look like a tea party
The GOAT has returned
Only True cj Fans Can like this Comment
Glad your alive and well Cj. And we got a video. And i got drink,smoke, and food. Its Litttt🔥🔥🔥
HES BACK 🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥
So we talking about orochimaru or we not?
The Sasuke video is inevitable and i am all for it.
This mans editing is crazy the mouth flaps kinda matches the audio 13:01
Man near the end of the show she straight up went insane
I'm surprised my boy hasn't done the one and the only blind bandit
Azula def a instigator, and gas lighter Mark from rdc would be proud 😂😂😂
Let my girl Azula go she has done nothing wrong! 😢
Aye when is gojo gonna get a black air force activity video?
Speaking of tea I need some cause Im sick little bit 12:06
1 hours gang
Azula was unhinged like a mothafucka
I must've missed a lot, i didn't know Aang was getting washed like that 😮
To put in the words of our dear Uncle Iroh  "Nah send the crazy bitch packing"
Azula really didn't have much of a chance, Zuko managed to be saved by his uncle who never gave up on him and his mother who cherished him which allowed him to get out of that accursed hole of despair and self-loathing. Their mother cherished both of them, but she was too deep in her father's camp to see it. All her efforts only to get a title was destined to be hers only to end up for it to be meaningless was literally the straw that broke the camel's back. If she could she would have chopped the man up into tiny bits herself, she basically self-destructed.
Aww man I'm excited for this 🎉
I’m in tune with my zodiac sign got me💀
"main character aint dead"  *Kamina Would Like To Have A Word With You*
Her glazing techniques must be studied. Would’ve thought she was a throat goat the way she be goblin Ozai.
W rizz moments 💀
Could you talk about sweet tooth from twisted metal some day
cj DaGoat
CJ you snapping with the new series😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Cj, you can't be playing with fire like this man! 😂
Asylum of black air force ? That’s a cool concept😂😂
Under 20
YOOO PUT HER ON THE ROUND TABLE!!!!!!!!!!! SCREW THE ASSILYM!!!!!!! BRUUUHHH SHE ON DEMON TIME FOR REAL!!!! YNW MELLY WOULD BE PROUD OF HER
I'm so glad you kept in her attempt at flirting.
Old school mw2 lobby banter was wild 😂
I KNEW THIS CHARACTER WOULD BE JUDGE EVENTUALLY!!~
This was amazing. Im excited for more Asylum episodes 😄
If this becomes a series, he needs to admit Ramsay Snow at some point.
Azula is someone where if you type crazy, besides Joker, Azula is right there.
I’m finally early this time😭
azula is crazy but i still would
At least zuko's hair gets better
My man for the first time ever had to use a real sound clip azula really was down bad 😂
When the world needed him most, C-Money returns with another banger.  Also if anyone else wants any more Azula craziness, read the comic. Girl goes bonkers in one of the coolest ways, basically Tormenting Zuko into success.
I love Cj's fuckin voice overs.
I was waiting for you to do Azula crazy self!  😂😂😂
Bro you need to put Gowther from seven deadly sins in here
Bro still hasn't made a video on samurai Champloo
bro got level 2 twice  edit: ik crazy nitpick
759th
CJ would have to make a football field sized asylum
14:07 reminds me awfully a lot of that one moment in CJ’a Buu vid where Majin Buu punched trunks before he could fuse with Goten😭
20:57 - You know Azula banishing the dai li was a very dumb thing to do because they would've helped her against zuko and katara later on but to be fair the dai li are nothing but cowards who always choose a winning side if they're losing like how they betrayed long feng and their own Nation for azula until she lost of course, I bet they were starting to regret that now.
i love u q t
W video
Do the rise of the TMNT movie. It's basically anime.
I thought you died
He has blessed us again🫡
Oh yeah my boy we've been waiting for this we've been letting her crazy behind slide for years
Returns when we needed him most 🙏🏾
Azula is one of the finest and craziest woman in fiction
azula casually breaking cartoon/anime rules
I would go insane too if my brother had such a ASS cut
Pt #000 Yuno Gasai aka the Yanderee patriarch.
HE'S BACK YA'LL, THE KING HAS ARISEN 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Lord Ozai + Joker = Mark Hamil
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 😂😂😂😂 the WARD
"Got you back jack, b***hess be crazy."
Been waiting for ts for so long 😭🙏 CJ 🔛🔝
Finally thank you
Our hero cj is back
It really doesn’t help Azula Gets Crazier as the Show goes on.
Thank you oh great cj Dachamp for another great video.
Azula is definitely a future #1 pick at the Haters'  Ball
Cj I want to see a black clover vid so if you can find some can you please do that🙏🏽
3:24 The craziest thing about this, is that this is the first time we see her. Imagine the first thing you see a new character do is then smiling at their brother getting half their face burnt off.
Ok
Azula had a damn crescendo of insanity 💀 Started off lightly narcissistic and ended off purely insane. The lack of motherly love is a insane thing  👩‍👧
"Don't flatter yourself. You were never even a player." remains one of the best villain lines I've ever heard.
Cj cmon man its the end of the month
Ii love this
Ngl as for the joker and Gotham criminal mentions a good chunk of them qualify for both the asylum and the round table
The asylum? The Joker’s neighborhood.
so you do this on the 26th of the month
Oh yeah watashi no wa Kira yoshikage
I’d still try to fix a girl like her 🙃
CJ we’ve missed you my man
been waiting for this😭
FINALLY AVATAR
The itachi pose had me crying
Azula will always be the best and tragic character of avatar hands down and it’s more crazy she’s only 14 years old and the only reason why she’s the way she is cause she never got her mom’s attention like Zuko did.  Mai will always be my favorite character!
This is certainly one of my most anticipated videos thanks cj
Finally to top off my great day
12:12 Long Feng wanna be Shang Tsung so damn bad.
Bro started with a tame character I can't imagine what crazy mfs are gonna be next 💀
Perfect timing, Azula’s gonna be in the base roster of NASB2.
Dang, it hasn't even been a hour and there more than 100 comments, also love your videos cjdamayne
Cj is back once more🔥🔥🔥
Bro got that dr nefario body
Another upload in the trash schedule
💀
Motherless psycho princess had me weak 😭😭
Bro let’s go for a ryuga from beyblade next
CJ you gotta watch the second season of to your enternity
Gotta the love avatar content 🔥
LETS HE POSTED
qwq
too real
I think episode 2 of The Asylum should be on Yuno Gasai
she hit the itachi lmao
So we got the Round Table and The Asylum?! That’s dope. And open more possible characters
Oh nah, I just re-watched atla, this chick gives Slade a run for his money with her manipulation skills.
Oh boy, not only are wer dealing with literal dangers to cilvilitation, but now the insane. How long till we deal with a being whos insane and has that energy.
YOOOO CJ CANT WAIT FOR DAT KIRA VID
Yo Cj wtf going on 😂
Hopefully you watch drifters and goblin slayer at some point cause man they go crazy
You should def make a jjk video when shibuya finishes or when we see sukunas rampage
Azula stays on perc 30 the whole damn time while she torching motherfuckers
The Asylum uh? Oh good good, for a sec i feared we weren't getting that father and son fight. Aight, call me in~
Next video has to be on Transformers Prime Megatron, because he was on TIMING
zuko's hair is a additional  punishment as aresult of his agni kai from what i heard
finaly
Azula defiantly has a list of 50 overly demanding Icks
Finally, another video to sink my teeth into
Early
Oh lordy we got a new Cj dachamp video over this crazy chick this is definitely a good Halloween present.
Let’s not forget: Zuko and Iroh took their chances with the ENTIRETY of the Earth Kingdom, rather than dealing with Azula
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO CJ MY BOI
Bro was a menace for no damn reason
cj!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When are we ever gonna see some Blue Lock content?  Everyone was straight toxic playing
😂😂
Smashed that like button so fast.
So are am I the only one who noticed Tom-Tom rockin the R9 cut 😅😂
Even when watching Avatar as a kid, I knew Azula was going crazy for power.
Im actually early for once
bro finally uploaded
I’m glad CJ is finally talking about Azula. Cause the moment she started smiling after telling Zuko that their GRANDFATHER died, I immediately knew she was a demon😂
Thank goodness your back your content is fantastic honestly, have such an amazing time watching 🐞
ngl im hungry
*before clicking on the video* No... Azula is too psychotic to be apart of the round- "Welcome to the Asylum" Apolgies for doubting you CJ. Please continue.
Hot damn a new series I can get behind that.
Up until the very last episodes, I was like, "I can fix her." Then she really swan dived off  the deep end.
Azula is the joker of avatar and I love it
I saw CJ Post and  I was so hyped cause I knew  he would cook the entire kicthen with this one🔥💯
Well well well, cj has returned
Ah Fire Princess Azula, the young woman who taught 9 year old me my taste in women...send help.
W vid
our champ finally got one of the Nickelodeon GOATs more recognition
Thank the Lord CJ Posted, that means it's a banger already
w early in a game rq coming ack later
Fr
Nah man all avatar fans dab me up
W new series
To quote Christ Tucker, “You one crazy ass bitch!”
For a new series yes Azula definitely deserves to be the first patient in the asylum because this girl is straight up crazy as hell and deserves to be there.😂
watching NBA and NFL.... stopped ASAP to watch this
Does everyone wonder what if azula and zuko swapped places?
Yo
FINALLY! I was hoping he'd talk about Azula's crazy arse!
NEW CJ SERIES??? LET’S GOOOOOO! I know Injustice Superman in there
“Baby’s got a goatee on his head” I can’t breathe 😂😂
we back baby
He came back when the world needed him the most
THE ASYLUM!? BRO! This is totally something new!😮I have to admit Azula is a total menace, mentally insane, manipulative and full of hatred! Keep it up Cj!!🤘🏼
I like this new series. Please do more. Also, Azula is an absolute PSYCHO!
Yo , i get back in and the man made a vid on a series i love ,
6:55 right one time 😮😮😨
When the world needed him most he returned.
So we just doing plain cartoons now...
Oooh Azula now this will be really awesome esspecially since how crazy she went when she lost To her brother man she really went off the deep end after the series ended!!!! Excellent work Cjdachamp another amazing video keep it up!!!!
And when the world needed him most……..he RETURNED!!
Azula the type of person to pull an Itachi but for fun
Now hold on think for a minute “This could be a new series🤔”
Do Joker (Not from DC Comics ) from Smile Pretty Cure
Azula’s such a menace she broke one of the sacred rules of Anime, and attacked the main character mid transformation EVEN THO THIS AIN’T AN ANIME
Babe wake up cj posted
8 minutes ago he posted this
Dam late at night and still making vids miss you man have a good night
Oh these asylum videos bout to go crazy because you might need a 3 parter for Joker.
Said this about a year go, can't have a BAF table without her
Do eminence in shadow next
A character for the asylum would’ve GOT to be Handsome Jack. Homie was so crazy bro murderered refugees after him and Hyperion stormed the train. Love your vids man, keep up the fire content.
I wonder if char aznable will be in the asylum or the council
Hey CJ, you need no, REALLY NEED to do CID aka Shadow from Eminence in Shadow, the real nigga that deserves a seat at your round table, even a few of his Shadow Garden females are worthy too to be honest, are you interested CJ
THANKS FOR THE VID
when a teenager is scarier than the actual final boss
Let’s gooo early too
Fun fact: after the story of ATLA Azula really goes to an Asylum
j
dachamp at it again . one of the best channel ever
We gotta get the eye patch chick from Kakegurui up in this bitch.
Me patiently waiting for the Doflamingo epsiode:🙂
Let's go!! Always a good day when CJ drops
this man just activated my child hood trauma
I just got one question: How did Azula get a video before Guts?!?!
Azula frying Aang as he’s going into the Avatar State reminds me of the time Aizen stopped Ichgo’s theme song
All hail CJ🙇🏾‍♀️
The last Airbender noice
JOKER HAS TO BE IN THERE
Let’s gooo he posted
do anime shigraki next for the mennaces
Katara better than Azula anyways (my opinion plus zuko made the right decision to cheat on her also my opinion)
I didn't know I needed this
Nah azula’s quote to that captain was terrifying: “you should quit worrying about the tides, who have already made up their minds about killing you; and focus on me, who’s still mulling it over” 😅😭😭
The Asylum?! LET'S GO!
CJ UPLOADED YAY
The GOAT of Hood Anime commentary has returned
Is orochimaru in the asylum
Ik yall be seeing them azula reddit yk pics😏😏😂😂 aye quick spam Simba messenges wit them, btw her calling her brother zuzu gave me incest vibes not when i was a kid but when i started watching as a teen🤣🤣
I ain't even watch the full vid but I know it's a banger frfr
Please do Shredder Next 💀🙏
When the secondary boss is more fierced and loved than the final boss.
we got the round table of disrespect and now an asylum for crazies i wonder what cj has for the good guys?
Azula can do no wrong. No Azula slander will be tolerated❌ nah but fr she should've been added to the round table a long time ago😂😭
when the world needed him most….he went to beat his meat😒
lesson learned you cant argue with crazy
Every time I watch CJ vids i laugh so hard 😂
azula is a menace
Finally, the legend has posted again. We may feast 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
Gosh, it feels like a miracle every time this man uploads!
nice idea cj, another messed up series 😂
ACEPTINAL VID
7th video asking for rimerue to have a full video
clicked immediately when i say him
The fact that a 14 year old Fire Nation princess turned an entire Dai Li army against a grown man tells me that she should've been a final villain.
He’s back frm the ashesssss
She’s definitely Vegeta’s mom
Who is the Queen of Black Air Force Activity??
breh i was just watching the ooga booga vid thinking when is cj gon bless our eyeholes
5 mins ago?? Blessed
Hey CJ can you do Adachi from Persona 4 cause I love him because he’s crazy
He did an avatar video lez gooo
I really like this idea good job CJ 👍
I can fix her.
YEAH
This is gonna be crazy
LETS GOOO ANOTHER VIDEO🔥🔥🔥
7th video asked for ainz ool gown to be in a black airforce video
Azula was catchin fades left and right. If not for the GAang and Iroh, she would’ve been smokin Zuko pack.
It’s cj yearly western cartoon menance video
When shits dead at work and cj drops a new video 👌👌👌
Azula was op as hell ngl.
I'm a man with priorities i see a new cj upload i click.
Goated show btw
I clicked faster than Flash, when I seen CJ upload.
Speaking of, I think Iroh belongs on the round table. Others may not agree but I think he belongs there if he isn't on already. Also glad to see another video. Missed your content Cj
I am going to love this series
How do you have 555 comments in 4 mins CJ 😭
Sup my boy Cj with another fire upload
I ASKED FOR THIS EXACT VIDEO SO MANY TIMES
madness.....MADNESS!!! THIS IS THE ASYLUM!!!!
I know two other psycho girls that would be perfect for The Asylum. Also, Shadow the Hedgehog in the RTBAF, when?
HE'S BACK
Yo, The Asylum is a cold ass title
I can see why they added her to nick brawl 2
.         .        . Nice
nahhhh the demon of avatar fr
W vid
The Goat is back with another classic!
let’s gooo, i’ve been waiting for this
Cj da goat
SECOND 🔥🔥🔥
Dead ass it’s been two minutes. Why the fuck does this video I have to 2k views two minutes. We all clearly got the bell notification and immediately clicked because there’s no way.
A very worthwhile new venture, crazies are a menace's biggest obstacle, to keep the roundtable on top it's best to contain or rehabilitate those crazies
I just watched the demon king of rizz
Yes another vid!!!!!!!!!!!!
NICE
This man used Mt. Massive Asylum as the exterior and I am getting flashbacks
Bruh spitting facts
I WAS WAITIN FOR THIS
W vid
My nigga do the next baki video this month please?
We’re gonna see joker next episode mark my words!!!!! Im excited
Bruh this is new
Haven’t even watched it yet, goat video 0:15
Dang
but whom is patient zero?
Can you correct it is all types of f****** country music
bird
Sticking it in Azula is a risk, a risk we definitely willing to take
I feel like the tetsuo shima is another patient or even the entire league of villians from MHA
It was always interesting to see Azula bend blue fire. Her only downfall was being mentally unstable lol
Awesome I hope to see more of this asylum
Batman’s rouges gallery bout to be half of this series
I love the timing of this amazing video I must say.
oh yeah another cj vid
When the world needed him most……
10/10 vid dude
EARLY GANGGGG
Oh today will be a good day

He didn’t miss him monthly upload. Let’s goooooo
This is so funny
EVERYBODY DROP YOUR SHIT CJ JUST UPLOADED
Azula's a bigger menace than Fire Lord Ozai.
The fact that Azula’s flame was already displaying where she drew it from emotionally, she was already damaged, took me a while to understand her breakdown at the end😭
BRO, I WAS JUST THINKING WHEN THE NEXT VIDEO WAS WHILE WATCHING THE JJBA PART6 VID
If he’s doing the asylum, he needs to add Jason Yamori from Tokyo Ghoul
👇🏾One minute gang
Not going to lie younger man I can fix her huge crush.😂
W vid🎉
Finally he's back
tryna pin me cj
Yurrrrr

STRAIGHT OUTTA NOWHERE!!!! AY, JOKER GOTTA BE NEXT!!!!!!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏  WELCOME BACK MY N**GA  I already know the girl from To your eternity is in this b!tch
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Azula: *gets added to the round table*.     Everyone else: *Scoots seat away*
I couldn't have asked for a better video to watch as I hop into the weekend 🙏
CJ you are the Goat but I have a question for ya who do you think had the most menace activity of our childhood CN Nick Disney or KidsWB
OUR KING
Junko better be in the asylum 👌🏿🦅🔥🙏🏿
Yes Chico is back!
Should do Zaheer from the legend of Korra next
Finally the best posted
wadduh
istg this nigga cj stay droppin bangers granted it be every month but the wait is always worth it for sure
FIRST!
Azula is insane, she's a demon
A vid a month is crazy
Cj I promise you if it takes you less than  a month tk upload ever again I will have my way with you
Yes another video. 🙏
i wanna see him do a vid on the creeper anime characters like hisoka, adam and Tsukiyama.
Ngl I feel bad for Azula if bc she was young I felt like if her mental health wasn't bad she definitely would've won against Zuko and Katara
Already know this finna be a banger 👀
Yo
father came back from getting the milk
After months he is back
YESSSIRRRRR NEW VID
Finally ❤
Azula stands above all as the pinnacle of hatred and insanity.  She was hating on Zuko the entire show, bro was fighting for his life and she was plotting on his downfall every single time.
Clicked immediately. All I gotta say is the fact that Azula not only commanded the entire room whenever she stepped on the scene but actually put fear into the hearts of folks if they dared try to defy her in any way. Plus the lightning use she had was pretty cool to see animated.   Thanks for the video CJ
I love the madness
I can’t wait for this new series, seems fire! 🔥
If Azula and Zuko were raised by their mother they would've turned out a lot better, especially Azula.
I welcome anything including Azula I welcome more Asylum videos I love the Roundtable but I already love the Asylum just as much
Fi nally something cj cant spoil for me
I love your videos some mush
