No dock for pain there harboring....dr/dock harbor...omg
“Some pray to God but it’s odd because satan’s catered all their dreams” such a 🔥 and true bar
A year later and I’m still unraveling that Daylyt verse. I absolutely cannot believe so much of this went over people’s heads.
Daylyt trying so hard not out shine someone who puts him on .. 😆😆  he make it to j cole standard so the fans dont feel he murk him. Eye see what you doing Quill 😮‍💨
Yo idk if you’ll know daylyt but I know you know him now he 🔥
OMG thank you
“Since mom ain’t paid them off, we’re trained to watch the names across a screen” that line gives me chills because ifykyk 🤯🔥
Cole the one that steps in with real spitters... Let's name a few : Daylyt, Ab Soul, Benny the Butcher, Joyner Lucas! J.Cole back in the 90s could have easily hang with the likes of Rakim, Gza. Nas, Krs One. Who agrees with me?
Ta escutando cassiano ou tá escutando puma kkkk 🇧🇷
Jcole has to stop taking peoples songs from them 😂
Put It on streaming this coming back to You tube thing ain't it 😭
This is genuinely gonna be one of those tracks/bars that's gonna be talked about for years to come, up there verses like *Masta Killa's in Da Mystery of Chessboxin* *One of the most poetic, lyrical, and thought-provoking verses to come from Cole* ✍🔥🔥
A whole verse 5 syllable scheme is insane
“My words is slick, when it's my turn to kick(tourniquet) I apply pressure like I'm trained to stop a leak How vain is my belief?”
I’m tired of coming back to YouTube 😂 put it back on streaming!
🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐 coleeee
blocks "hunted" not haunted...yep bounty hunters and grapes.....there some levels to this shit
dangerous as the king of pop/ how well they spin your block/ no moves, minimal/ smooth criminals the whole crew doing insane amount of lean/ omg. 🔥🔥🔥🔥 j.cole is Ill son
1:51
That sample! Cassiano 1974
sample veio do brasil 🔥🔥🔥
It’s funny bc people can’t use Cole’s raps to discredit him so they use the apology
They took this off digital streaming 🤦🏾‍♂️
Why this not on iTunes anymore
Good song and record! If only Cole had it in him to go at people lyrically! Both these artist did something great for the culture on this joint!!!! I wish daylyt had Cole’s storytelling ability and Cole had Daylyts conviction !
If that 3rd eye ain't open u gotta look in the Jetstream for these bars
Se Deus quiser Amanhã verei o meu amor 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I’m 40. J Cole is the G.O.A.T… I’m sorry 🤷🏾‍♂️
Daylyt stands alone at the top of the mountain. Nobody is on his level.  A true artist in every sense of the word. Daylyt is the  Rap Games Boogie Man. Ur favorite rapper favorite Rapper , The Ghost writers , Ghost Writer.
It was never about his bars, the hate came from fans having to choose sides in 50 beef. Add in him embracing the villain role and beefing with 1/2 of the industry (Dr. Dre most importantly) at some point. But being he had an entire coast behind him, if he could've been bigger than 50 if g-unit never split. All organically too. Lyrically though, you can't deny that boi been nice day 1. 🔥🔥
Best track of the decade 🔥
Why is this not on apple music anymore smfh ? Goated rap.
Se Deus quiser, amanhã... Brazilian sample, Ladies and Gentlemen 🇧🇷
https://youtu.be/vDflCgG9Wt0?si=DR9sHe-XIjijGsph  a little remix I did. Can’t compete with the goats tho🤷🏽‍♂️
Music brasil
Cassiano - Castiçal 📍🇧🇷🫱🏾‍🫲🏽🔥
Who here in 2025? 👋🏼
Why is this song unable for download on apple in ‘25? I’m tryna listen today and Apple is like nah shawty my fault
Cassiano! 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Put it back on streaming sites please !?!?
To all the rap music scholars out there, the sample used in J. Cole's track comes from the Brazilian artist Cassiano. Interestingly, this sample had already been used previously by André, a beatmaker from the group Quinta Dose. André recognized the potential of Cassiano's sample early on, and now, with J. Cole recording over it, that vision has been solidified.    For those who want to hear the Brazilian boom bap version produced by André, here’s the link: [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1sXgmp0-cdY](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1sXgmp0-cdY).
Why tf they take this off Apple Music ?🤦🏾‍♂️🔥
🇧🇷🎼🎧❤️🎶👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
🇧🇷🔥
THEY TOOK IT OFF APPLE MUSIC CAUSE THIS SAMPLE DIDNT GET CLEARED AND IM HELLA UPSET CAUSE THE NEW VERSION OF THIS SONG IS NOT IT 😤😤💯
Respect J.COLE. Thanks for use CASSIANO sample's R.I.P Cassiano, brazilian soul music legend.
To the Batmobile!!!!!!
Gratidão ao J. Cole, desenterrando nossos clássicos.
Sample Cassiano from Brasil Castiçal the name of the song.
They took it off of Apple Music😖
Shoutout to Cassiano! J. Cole killed it with a dope track over a beautiful sample from our master, straight outta Brazil.🇧🇷
🇧🇷❤
Cassiano 🇧🇷❤️
People really think Kendrick better???? Y’all deaf
Is crazy all the people talking about they disappointed in J.Cole for bowing out of a rap beef.  He bowed out in starting true to who he was and I can’t condem him for that . There’s also pole talking about he’s weak for the public apology I ain’t mad at that either that’s a sign of a mature emotional intelligent brown man . My grandfather used to if you can down talk a man public you have to be big enough to apologize publicly there joes the difference between boss and grown men.
First verse he literally clearing it up that there's no smoke it's all love... hookah/clouds/smoke scheme... homage to capital steez.... third round hey now🦇👈🏾watch out
They took this song off Apple Music🤔
The Wordplay is unmatched 🤯 Crazyyyyyyyyy work!
Pen game different on this one
They snubbed Cole from a nomination for “Best Lyricist” at the BET awards.   They stripped him of it all smh. Both Kendrick and Drake are nominated.  Kendrick is the King for real, hands down but plz understand Cole is the Crownless King for certain.
Bumping in 2025 like it’s 2013 again
Why this off Apple
"Castiçal" por Cassiano, Brasil 🇧🇷
I swear I heard this 2 years ago. Everything is feeling like a repeat.
🔥🔥🔥 COLE WORLD
CASSIANO  ❤♥️🇧🇷🇧🇷♥️🇧🇷♥️🇧🇷♥️🇧🇷♥️🇧🇷♥️😭😭😭😭😭😭
“Se Deus quiser amanhã Verei o meu amor Algo me diz que amanhã A coisa irá mudar”.   Sample of the candlestick song, by Cassiano. 🇧🇷
🇧🇷🫶
Brazilian Cassiano’s sample music name: Castiçal.
🇧🇷🍀🤍
Esse Sample 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Why tf this isnt in spotify
That's why he's the best 🤝
RIP CASSIANO
It warms my heart to see ppl recognize what I discovered 12 years ago 😊
Kendrick can NOT fuck with J Cole. I promise y’all.
Cole lyrically been on a tear since 2018
Put this in the Bible of lyricism.
Knowing that Soul had a verse on this. If you haven’t listened to it, please do
I'm glad Cole went last. His verse was the perfect balance/blend of bars and flows.
I wonder if someone has talked about this in the comment section.   The "lean" in "doing insane amount of lean" could also be a reference to purple drank, a recreational drug. That said, this only adds another layer of meaning to the "this ain't prescribed cause there's no doc for pain they harboring". While the first "lean" refers to physical pain, the second "lean" refers to substance abuse. The antidote?   A Plate of Collard Greens.    Whatya think? :)
J. Cole is the GOAT.
Before I listen this shit lame 😂😂
We need Jcole + Roc Marciano. If you dont know im sorry
Its wild that im a month late smh i need to turn my hiphop card in
🕊
Please put it on soundckoud
🔥🔥🔥
Y'all don't know about Daylyt🙆🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️ bless your heart
This song would have been bigger if Cole's verse came first and that was it😅
alice medíocre sampled this too
O Sample, cassiano - castiçal   Dos maiores
Battle Rap GOAT and  THE RAP GOAT🤯🤯🥶🥶🥶🥶🫡
Much Love and respect❤ bismallah
Goodness
This aint talked about enough!
Guy has talent for real, but he went in a real anti-semitic direction when Kanye was doing it...
Im here for Daylyt🥱🥱🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🐐  Daylyt is the GOAT
Not enough Daylyt praise in these comments at all…. Wtf is going on
Muito foda saber que somos reconhecidos 🇧🇷
Nobody else recognized the Rocky/Creed sample in there?
In Oakland CA. We call this gas!⛽️
j.cole the man
Bro lyrically Dot or Drake not seeing Cole..I stand on that
Lamb of God
Se deus quiser
My gawd
Just another mid jcole verse
How many verses of the year this year is cole gonna write ? 😮‍💨
Ladies and gentlemen king Cole
I wanna hear J Cole rap Wit Eddie Valero
"I'm not as mean as my homies that played on project swings" Only niggas from the hood see that visual 🔥🔥🔥
Daylyt Cole goat1&2
Gotta day thr first time i saw cole get out done in a track
This is modern day poetry at its finest 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Cole is cool but let’s not forget he’s hanging around with diddy and jay x enjoying all the spoils of his success quiet as a church mouse while people actually fighting wickedness struggling because of their morals I don’t want to hear righteousness out of someone like that.
i want the original sample its similar to that of ants live sweet life freestyle
Impressao minha ou essa musica tem praticamente a mesma metrica de Contorno do pumapjl? Kkkk fora o sample
J Cole diss weak, but I’d love to see Cole vs Kendrick bar for bar. This man can RAP
Daylyt is always rapping off-beat.
Damn daylight kingshit space, age, forever
Cole would eat k dot any day
As a Father, having two Daughters, I felt this song to the core. It's amazing how much love a Father has for his kids
This is real hip hop
Protect cole. Please guys, everyone
Overdue
Ok light 🕯️
Bro ingoma ye album le kodwa ifavourite yami🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥I respect you
This triple: Where "Fade" is not for scene! (Movie set) Where fade is not for scene. (These fights are for real) Where fade is not forseen. (You don't even see this wreck coming). Jermaine!!!
Daylty that nigga
Verse of the year
Its about to be two weeke and he still aint drop the song 🤦‍♂️
Every rapper can't rap on this beat. Amazing job gentlemen.
I like how you can hear Daylyt’s chair squeaking in the beginning
There’s a large gap between Cole and the rest lyrically.
what's the sample?
The Micheal Jackson reference to explain the yns spinning blocks and heavy on drugs was too 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
One of Coles best verses and I ain’t just saying that because it’s new
Why Isn’t this on streaming? Can’t waste bars like this!
prod. by python p pakk music
Daylyt be sounding like a breed between Westside Gunn & Cole and still maintaining his originality.
Remind them all cole
This song is insane
🔥🔥🔥
The grippy era is over 🔥💀🔥
Thank God 🙏🏽
Tatum off the screen bar went off way he set it idc
Wait hold up is this directed to ScHoolboy Q and Kendrick - Collard Greens.
Been following Cole from Who that these new fans jumping on because of Drake beef J Cole and Kendrick been repping hip-hop them two beefing was never needed for the game
Still the 🐐
I have been a Cole fan since '09, but these bars of him being dangerous need to stop after he backed out against Kendrick. I understand that he wanted to stay out of it, but that 7 Minute Drill was terrible and it was the first time we actually saw Cole respond to someone directly. It was mediocre at best. I am sure you have die-hard fans who will say I am wrong, but as someone who loves Cole, I can't believe him after what we all heard. Like I said, it wasn't the fact that he backed out because that is understandable, it was more so the diss track itself. All that tough talk and you delivered that (7MD)??
This cole beat he had to kill #sidelinestory
Man, that tourniquet line was crazy and I haven’t been seeing it get mention.  My words is slick, when it’s my turn to kick (tourniquet). I apply pressure like I’m trained to stop a leak. How vein is my belief? There is something in every line in this verse.
Can't stand the people who think Cole still ain't like that
Cole my #1  he never left his bag
Whoa
And this is what pisses me off! Lol him bowing out of that battle gives lames the opportunity to say that he was scared of Kendrick and that Kendrick is better. Ain't no mf way, man! 🤦🏾‍♂️😄
J cole definitely racist
Verse 2: J. Cole The reign is obsolete, Jermaine is out to be Celebrated, paraded out in the streets for days, if not for weeks For bringing us out the bleakest, burning pit My words is slick, when it's my turn to kick I apply pressure like I'm trained to stop a leak How vain is my belief? To say that I could be the greatest y'all done seen With my cadence proper, from days I laid across the street From these Caucasian neighbors, new kids I stayed around I'd green and not as mean as my homies that played on project swings What fate has not foreseen My brain stained, engrained with the stories of slain bodies from heinous robberies And rated R regimes, exchanging raw for cream Tricked 'em and went left, they pull up shootin' like Tatum off a screen The bills is due, as kids we knew the way the calls would ring Since mom ain't paid 'em off, we trained to watch the names across the screen And let collections pass just like we failed to make an offering Gotta channel thoughts 'cause damn, the cable off, it seems Deep down, I hated Halloween, with all that I have seen Who needs another way to cause a scream? Dangerous as the king of pop, how well they spin your block No moves, minimal, smooth criminals The whole gang doin' insane amount of lean This ain't prescribed 'cause there's no doc' for pain they harboring Some pray to God, but it's odd, 'cause Satan's catered all their dreams Spiritually malnourished, dehydrated, now they feign For truth in these flows, food for they souls, to make it all serene, uh Well, here's a plate of collard greens (Uh), yeah
🙏🏽👍🏽👑🇵🇷👏🏾✌🏾
🌹
Haters are always going to be lame. Let em be… J Cole is the 🐐
No beat no drums just straight bars
SE DEUS QUISER!
This is why Cole stepped away from all of that back and forth nonsense, he’s too grounded, and that foolishness was below him.
J Cole is really the greatest rapper alive, as much as I love KDOT, this man hits hard and its so relatable.
We not gonna talk About Daylyt Verse???🔥🔥🔥
You’re not top 5 if you’re afraid to go live - everyone
Se deus quiser 🇧🇷
Cole left earth
This is not Jovi 😂 it’s just funny to me cuz kao can’t stay in the same room with Jovi bro. Jovi is far far ahead bro
Williams George Lee George Miller Maria
Daylyt and Cole are GOATS forreal
The soul on this is immaculate, that sample chop wow
COLE WORLD NO BLANKET!!!!!!
Cole just jumped to #1 this verse was insane
🔥🔥🔥 soulful hip hop baby. No drugs no women no bs just bars and real life.
They adore me but i aint here for the bullshit
J cole verse was mid
That halloween line from Cole wow!
I didn’t know I needed this ❤
The fall off gonna be 25 songs from other rappers all with a verse from Cole 😂 He bodies every feat.
Bruh why cant i remember the original song this beat was sampled from? Was it young jeezy or yo gotti? Someone help me out
Ain’t worried bout no reaper
Love this collab!
Not going to lie, I've heard of Dalyt for years now. Mainly when he used to be trolling on the interwebs. But never took the time to actually check his music, he sounds good here. And of course Cole did his thing too.
This shit is high level Lycrism 🔥🔥🔥🔥
They just showing off atp! 🔥🔥
"What fade is not foreseen?" 🎻🎶
Makes no sense how effortless it’s for J Cole
I didn’t know daylyt could rap lol 🔥🔥🔥
Daylight is one of the coldest lyricst to spit but j cole made me forget his verse in 2 bars... lol.. that's crazy bruh

Look everyone everywhere. It’s okay to just be yourself and stand where you stand on things. Calm down
💰🔥🔥🔥👌🏿
I mean he really is the goat tho
it’s crazy that cole wrote something so great but daylyt still a level above
they should do a full album together they go great together
🫡❤️‍🔥🐦‍🔥⚡👁️
Cole will never fall off
When is this going to be on Spotify!!!!
Day speak on some shit fr fr
DatPiff?! I thought y’all was gone?!
Daylyt proving he wrote time stamp drake songs
Reminds me of 2014 back when hip hop was still in a good spot 🔥💯. Appreciate this track…it’s on the OGz to flood the game with real music!
This Cole gonna be AI lol Don’t fall for the troll
He back cole is back in his bag
Daylyt true 🐐
Daylyt 🎉
They really used a variation of westside right on time by Kendrick
Perfect
Cole! ❤️🐐  🇧🇷
Shoutout to the new generation and mine for one of the greatest if not the best period 💯 #ColeWorld 🎙️ inspiration ✨
Air Cole!!
"Gotta channels thoughts because cable off " 🗣️
"Relax and relapse" that's facts
Cole 🔥🔥🔥
This beat is nuts 💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥
Daylyt above the algorithms
Hayden Ford
Cole may have folded the battle but that man still has his pen game intact!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Daylyt sounding like Royce on this
Cole is doing the best rapping of his entire career this year. Can’t wait to hear ‘The Fall Off’ 😤
Jmole can rap still but he disappointed us
Cole acting like some great anomaly, til he bites off more than he can chew, and then makes apologies.
Sheesh
This song is on Apple Music under the artist name “J. Colle” thank me later
Daylyt always brings the best out of j Cole 😮‍💨
FOOD FOR THOUGHT
https://youtu.be/uzxfImDaKFc?si=TmGArlFKzDoHgdwZ
Cole always going to be the goat. Some of y'all nixxas in the comment section, was sum of da same nixxas  I bet was juss hating on this nigga for apologizing.  Now you're going to switch sides,come on bra how that work(i juss amusing,sum of nixxas was juss sayn fuk cole). Cole and Kendrick would've been even fair. Bra was rlly smart wen yall think abt it. Black Friday was good example of wat a diss could've been like between dem nixxas(but dey was using each other beats). Cole KILLA🐐🗣️
A lot of people back on Coles dick again after slamming him a few months ago. He never even said he was "sorry" or "I apologize" and everyone ran with what a headline said and gave him so much shit because they "wanted to see BLOOD."
If Drake wasn't such a good we could've got one of the SICKEST lyrical battles EVER! Cole knew Drake was gonna go dirty & Q told him it was gonna get ugly so Cole didn't wanna be involved. I still respect the MC in him he couldn't not shoot back😅   I WISH Drake would dare mention his name to the point Cole shoots back. Cole will bury Drake all over again! It's clear he already chose a side.
We really should’ve got Kendrick vs j Cole 😢
Pulling up shootn 🔫 like Tatum off a screen 🍀😤
1:52
Kariane Via
Ebert Pines
They shooting like Tatum off the screen, niga what? Nah bra!!! Get this man out the booth before he set the whole place on fire!!🔥
Daylyt the most underrated lyricist
I don’t like Daylyt as a battle rapper, but this dude got venom in his pen…no cap.
Bro hearing the sample in portuguese broke me, not gonna lie I thought I was getting crazy for a sec
God DAMN JERMAINE
He connected the tourniquet to the vein and then a few bars later MJ the lean and the docs prescription in the same cadence. Sheesh.
Like they bring the best out each other lyt and cole 🥶😮‍💨
cole, daylyt, and ab-soul should make a joint album
Cole has always been the Goat to me
Wow…👏🏽👏🏽
Lyte took this song.
Daylyt and Cole should do a EP asap their style compliments each other
Why isn’t it on Spotify 😭
No spotify?
Lauriane Harbors
the lyrical *rumbling.*
Fun Fact: The sample says “God willing I’ll see my love tomorrow”  Artist- Cassiano Song- Castiçal
Cole is always on the grind, he puts in works and hits all scenes. None of these other rap dudes doing real shit like that.
Cole could've gave kendrick a run for his money, ima keep saying it, he didn't bow out cause he couldn't take him

Cole remains ridiculous.
sample?
Sample brasileiro ❤❤❤ gosta muito do Brasil 🇧🇷
As vain as I can be, disdain is far from, how we came is alchemy, outwit pain out with ease, yours truly, unruly, how can we evade our destiny, eve ate and Adam lost his empathy, naked and afraid, able to die from brother greed, indeed sacrifices unapease
Stopped counting after the first half of the verse till I realized the whole thing is a double entendre… Masterful
Cole is better than Kendrick and Drake
I mean of course J.Cole murdered this track but Daylyt definitely wasn't to far behind
On Ibiza Cole says nobody killed him on all these songs he's been on, but I think this song changes that
Hane Skyway
Skipped right past whatshisname☠️😭
They sample a Brazillian song 🤯🤯🤯
When 'The Fall Off' drops...that's a time to be alive 😤
Yeah yall owe me a new pair of headsets after this
J cole is the goat man 🐐 greatest ever to do it ❤
This deserve million man
🙏🏿✊🏿🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Autumn Manors
Castiçal do Cassiano marcando presença demais ❤
Everything about this track is just 🔥🔥🔥 instrumental, bars, delivery, flow, cadence wtv! you name it!
🎧💜
Cole still got it tho
He slick dissing. dot on his ass. Word to muva but it’s a TRAP.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥
J. Cole raps better than Kendrick and Drake. Kendrick is the best artistically Drake makes the best songs but when it comes to the bars neither one of them are better than Jermaine
Cole and Daylyt always bringing the best bars outa each other 🔥🔥
Man, I wanted to hear drums on the shit
Kinda sounds like one of the same ole same ole its like i see his dropping music and i know what line his gonna be in already, needed the beat to drop and something uplifting
Daylyt is the greatest rapper of all time.
It's grippy😂 dude really fell off like the Simpsons
even with grippy cole is one of the best feature artists of all time. every feature is fye. how he be doin it
Since Kenny popping off these two got to do the album they never gave us. King Cole 👑
This is highly elevated & worth a few listens.
Can I wright to this or will I be fixed with a Crew say fix to this hisss spanic inflex of warriors ignoring the door and taking of city blocks with Glocks to ops grops nailed it to crosswalk crip cide or Blood cide they all sui in a way if I can say the snake bites invite the little one's on trik I wrote this Freestyle One minute in a tic TOC TOc lyrics drop I didn't need the full riff to drop this just think if I had time my tongue would be charity A march of Dimes no more crimes just hyms and chimes 🎤🧛
We’re not surprise by Cole going off keep on keeping on but shout out Daylyt your no rookie
Hip Hop lives 🔥
"Dangerous as the king of pop, how well they spin the block/ no moves minimal, smooth criminals, the whole gang doing insane amount of lean"  I just realized the punch line is referring to the iconic scene in the Smooth Criminal music video where Michael Jackson and his backup dancers do that INSANE 60 degree lean that had the world going CRAZY 🤯🤯🤯🤯  J. Cole is a MONSTER 🐐
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Brazil sample mentioned!!!!!!!
Brazilian sample go crazy
cole you can touch me inappropriately.
Sample do Cassiano? 🔥🔥🔥
J cole applies 0 pressure lol another cap rapper
j cole will return unscaved
J Cole 🇺🇸
Please put this song on streaming service
BRASIL!
Why does j cole voice kynda soud like cordae a lil.💀
Jermaine is the GOAT 🐐👑🙇‍♂️
this shit is beautiful
🥇🏆
Glad it aint Grippy no more
Jesus Christ is the son of God he wants yall to repent before it’s too late.  One day all the mockery will end.
Love the feature, love the vibe. J Cole killing it as usual. Shout out to Daylyt, dude has always been a beast, happy to see him getting recognized. Been following throughout his battle rap career. 🔥
Honestly them and Soul just need to make a album already
Needa whole album of cole and daylyt
Cole the greatest omg
Daylyt is the one featured I didn't even hear the broh rapping
I thought it was a snippet on Instagram 🫡
Why this not on streaming
The fall off is going to be a masterclass in rapping ngl he can talk about so much. I wouldn't be surprised if he pushes it back to include the fall off of hiphop in there as well. I'm positive extra songs were made for that project after the events of this year.
Jermaine is back in his duffy. LFG!!!
#Lifeunda style
Only Cole could do this and grippy in the same year like wtf
Kendrick never had a chance! True cole fans know this! When he starts spitting like this hes untouchable
this slap
That tourniquet line set up was wild 👀
frontin fickle fans xD a lot of you were dissing cole not too long ago. COLE WORLD
2:40
Cole World let’s go🔥🔥🔥
If you called him J Fold or claim that he wasn't in the big three because he respected himself enough to know that he didn't want to go and do a diss battle that he literally said didn't feel right in his soul then you have no right to be here and act like y'all day one fans. Some of y'all backed out and got to start over. Y'all clown him for being a real man and now want to ride. FOH. 🤡
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Which pressure are you applying? you just ran from Kdat beef 😂😂😂
THIS BEAT AHHHHH
Is that the album release date on the ticket?
se deus quiser amanhã verei o meu amor
We're in the lyrical era folks...no beat just fire🔥🔥🔥🔥!
"si Deus kizer... amanha..." what the rest???
he finally recovered from grippy
Man Cole spazzed on this fr. No words..
They mad-adore-me but I ain’t here for the bullshit 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
WE NEED A J COLE FEAT RANSOM ASAP!!!!!!
I fuck with Cole. I really do. But now these "I got bodies" and "I apply ptessure" bars feel so empty after his apology to Dot.
“Got to channel thoughts cus cable off its seems”😮
Daylyt never facing Lux at this point

Garbage song to go with these garbage rappers
Ok Lyt 🤔
The is the best Feature run by a rapper. Cole just gifted🍃🙏🏾
Cole is the best rapper alive right now.    Fuck all the bias towards Kendrick.     J Cole is best breathing
“J Cole is a problem” - Big Daddy Kane  For those who don’t know who Big Daddy Kane is: “Women treat me like BDK (Big Daddy Kane), the King (Kane is called King Asiatic) and they feed me grapes (Like Kane’s Long Live the Kane album cover)” - Eminem, Murdergram Deux  “Mechanic’s brain with a pinch of Big Daddy Kane in it” - Eminem, Renaissance  “MCs that wreak havoc on tape decks, ADAT’s, where the G Raps and KANES at?” - Eminem, Lucky You
Cole killing drake ghost writer but drake fans have Cole in number 3 lmao delusional 😂
IT'S IT'S IT'S GRIPPY!!!!
Cole done renegaded another one
So this is why he separated himself  from the Cloud, 🥵🙆🏾‍♂️😳🚶🏾‍♂️
I need this J Cole and Lil Wayne on a track together my God this is a blessing to my ears
gah damnnnnn😮😮😮
"Backseat of the police car but never cop out"
Still HIM
A playe of collard greens= A plate of soul food 😤

How many verses of the year this year is Cole gonna write?
People act like cause he left that beef it changed his goat status. Cole wants to ride his bike in peace not be in some corporate bullshit now look at what it was. Kendrick heard 7 min drill, still could have said something to j cole but didnt…

Boring we no longer respect you xhump
Cole is the Goat 🐐 this dude rhymed all the way through the same rhyme scheme as a plate of collard greens that’s a 5 syllable rhyme all the way through for people who don’t write music they don’t know how hard this is his syllable game is top tier only Eminem could match his syllable game💯
Cole needs a song with sauce walka
cole was born for this shit😭😭
Cole still the COLE'ST🔥🔥🔥
2:43 - 3:10 go re listen to that and think
Jcole cadence is immaculate. So profound and digestible yet still intricate and overheads at the same time.
Love all the positive comments The Goat is Back 😤
Hell yeah daylyt getting some shine
need DaBaby on the remix
Bruh! This One of the best verses I ever heard! - Cole
ion know bout the beat but cole still hit
These bars go over a lot of people's heads.
Oh a new Drake and Cole song ?
Yea! Daylyt still alley oop it to J. Cole with 5 defenders on him and he still dunked that bitch. 😂🔥
This duo would be lethal 💯
Yesssssssss 2024 is the year
Nice bars! I love the flip of the Rakim sample! I'm looking forward to The Fall Off!
COLE IS TOP 2 UNDER KDOT. RESPECT 👌
Cole will forever be the GOAT
"Spiritually mild nourished dehydrated now they fiend, for truth in these flows, food for they soul to make it all serene......well here's a plate of collard greens"❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
This verse and his verse on Johnny Ps Caddy are 🤌🏽🤌🏽 top tier
They can’t make me hate you Cole! J.Cole>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> kendrick
Daylyt with the double entenderas....Geez Louise! 🔥
The br🇧🇷 semple is fireeeee   Castiçal by Cassiano ❤️
Daylyt wordplay on another level
And this guy said he was drake’s ghost writer? His verse is 🚮
Yall heard that subtle jab at Kendrick at the end. See, Cole said, "food for your thoughts, now heres a plate of collard greens." The reqson why it's a subtle jab is because Kendrick featured on a Schoolboy Q song called: 'Collard Greens.' Remember who you got it from first.
Sounds like he’s eating skittles in the beginning
When it's my turn to get (turnaquet), I apply pressure. Like I was trained to stop a leak !!!! 🤯🤯🤯🤯
Elite penmanship
DAYLYT N COLE ARE HEAVY SPITTERS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥WITH THIS SONG THEY CLOSE THE CURTAINS
cole been rapping like the goat recently
2/14/2025 😂😂😂 i look forward to that album
the way Cole can always find the perfect words with the perfect syllables to go along with his whole rhyme scheme is why bro is the best. so much effort involved into this type of ART. Datlyt too. these niggas is TALENTED
Everyone talking about Cole verse and it’s 🔥 But Daylight verse is  just as crazy 🔥
Cole World still aint shit changed
Daylyt is so slept on
"This ain't prescribed cause there's no doc(dock) for pain they harboring!!" Jermaine everyone!
How vain is his fucking belief????? The fucking goat! 🐐

Why is Cole always so fucking boring with his delivery, I can't listen to this shit, they are both boring as hell. He's a great writer but a bad rapper because he's so fucking slow and boring with very weird choices when to pause.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Cole World, Cole Life, Cole Blooded🗣️💯🙏🏽

That sample is crazy. It's Portuguese btw. "Se Deus quiser..." Is all I could understand from it
I will get down on all fours for Cole I will do anything for Cole Cole is the king no matter what
That Brazilian sample slaps   Cassiano - castiçal
“Some pray to God but it’s odd  because Satans catered all their dreams” 😮‍💨
Kendrick a grate artist but he can't do what Cole does ..
"How many more verse of the years is Cole gonna write?"
Cole constantly brings respect and love for the art of rap and lyricism.
I’m glad the Goat got another Track w/ Cole 😤🔥

"When it's my turn to kick (tourniquet), I apply pressure like I was trained to stop a leak"
Trash.       - J Cole is spineless
I cant hear Cole the same…. He shouldve never apologized
Cole is the best lyricist to ever live. No convincing me otherwise. Daylyt is so slept on as well.
Lyt better than cole and ken
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
not one 808 or hi hat.
This verse is insane Cole really the undisputed GOAT of todays music
Daylyt is that dude.  Appreciate you too Cole
Good Grief. Hip HOp. Don't talk to me about the othe dudes unless it's Shady.
"Some pray to God but it odd cause satans catering all their dreams"🔥🔥🐐
Cole said “I gotta go to the source” and went to Daylyt. 🤣🔥
@YouTube I’m gonna like this video, but please don’t suggest me any of those Daylyt videos that make me contemplate everything about life for months
Cole is him!
Why is this not on Spotify 😤😤😤😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Yes.. we findind our way back my people's!!!

King Cole💯
This it!!???? That’s it Cole!??? Nah … I get it frfr but expected doper
This actually cured my cancer
Can some one make a version with Cole verse only please thank u
People forget for in the stories of the masses, some say Jesus lost because he lit them hang him on the cross, why didn't he just use his gifts or call on his boss,  nah that wasnt the reason of that sacrifice, for on the 3rd day He rose from after Life, a newer being, cleaner and renewal, with words and love for those who were love of thier souls, cole did the same awaiting for the chance to return and show, regardless of who crazy we are he still here for us the rap community- I was goin in a little with my pen, but stop bc at work on the pc of them
The sample is in Portguese,i noticed because it's my language.It's saying "Se Deus quiser,amanhã...verei o meu amor" which means "if it's God's will,then i'll see my love tomorrow"i already loved both Cole and Daylyt,but now my respect for them is WAY higher. Btw the name of the sample song is Castiçal by Cassiano
Mais 1 sample dos BR 💪💪

FIRE TRACK all around 🤧 but bro this nigga cole man… the pinnacle i plan to reach. this is mastery at work fr
I love jcole and I want nothing but greatness for him and this was great, but not the best. I understand why the fans are feeling that way though, after everything, let them have their moment
He is the Greatest of ALL TIME.  Cole World. No Blanket.
Shout out to both artist it’s a dope track hands-down, but can I just ask one question is this something that J. Cole has done on this song that we have not seen him do before? 🤷🏾‍♂️
Where is the beat?🤢
cole killed this man he should’ve stayed in the beef and smoked both of em
I need Kdot and Cole to do a joint together
Beat is whack, needed some base gawd dammnit
I need an instrumental. Asap
Cole been letting the Party Die since 2013 and Kdot wanna act like he started something 🤡 lmao
Best J-Cold verse I've ever heard. Wow!
yo this is RIDICULOUS
Murazik Stravenue
no disrespect, but im seeing why Daylyt is a ghost writer, mf got bars, but boy he aint got no personal style when spittin😭😭 whole time he was spittin sounded like jcole wrote his shit and told him how to spit it. that could be on purpose to align with cole on the song but dang idk. dope song tho
"Some pray to God but it's odd cuz satan catered all their dreams... Spiritually malnourished, dehydrated now they're feens"  That shit tough
This is a very hard beat to rap on because there are no kicks, snares and bass so it is hard to know when to start rapping, so you have to do it like poetry and you must count to start at the right time. This was very impressive from both of them to just float on the beat like that🙌🙌
I can hear Q Aura on this 🔥🌊🎶
Sample da música Castiçal (Cassiano), que honra
Its honestly insane to me hearing one of my favorite battle rappers on a song with one of favorite artists. Been a fan of Daylyt since “CAPTAIN AMERICA” if you know you know.
J Cole’s talent speaks for itself
Light is the god of hip-hop really. He proved it in his tay roc battle (for those who know). However, in music he lacks delivery, something that cole never comes up short with.   Daylyt takes too many pauses throughout his verse. If he can make his flow blend seamlessly with no pauses, like his tayroc battle, he'll be untouchable. Trust me!!🤞
People who hold Cole’s apology over his head are deaf to the situation that was actually happening at the time. Cole was never supposed to be involved
That boi Cole been in the cut minding his business this ENTIRE time… plz do NOT bother that man🫡😬🥴
I hate daylyts choppy flow
what was this beat originally from? I cant think but I just remember it was 🔥
j Cole ate that plate of collard greens 🎉
No drums again 🤮
daylyt a monster. much respect to cole an industry rapper keeping up. thi is on some LUX level
Yoo check out my first song i got a dream to  make it in the game and all I'm asking of yall is to view it and if u like it share if u can. It's hard trust. 🔥🔥
Keep blessing us like this cole 💯💯❤️you”re the GOAT 🔥
Cole really clicked with me on this tune. Like I knew him as an alright humble rapper but his wordplay never really got to me until now. Is that weird? Still an incredible performance from both!
It's crazy how different social media users have different views
Yooo!! First of all 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 and second. That's the first time I've heard a cole verse with no cussin
😵‍💫🤯
Are nigga really sure Cole is scared of Kendrick? Cause we all know that Kendrick didn’t rap like this on not one diss song… ijs…
Miss me with the Cole slander! Cole World 😤
*Wow. There are levels Daylyt*
Black Americans would listen to this but still not hear - sad.
We can't tear Cole down man. He's one of the few that gives us REAL RAP. The game needs him IMO. We let these wack rappers get a pass, but a man apologizes for his peace of mind is who we cast out? Nah. Cole World! Daylyt killed this too. I love when he makes music more than when he battles.
Battlerappers are ELITE 😤
J cole doing tracks with artist like daylyt goes to show how much he appreciates hiphop!!
Cole wrld
Instrumental isn't good tho
man i dont wann hear cole mention goat after ducking the fade and lyt nice but I don't care whats said until him vs lux happens tbh
Geesh the Cole stans in here 😂.  They both snapped to me
Freeway hustler prayer
Cole never snooze....iykyk
Would’ve been funny if this was a “Tub full of collard greens”…
sheesh with the portuguese sample😭😍
Lol everybody talkin bout jole cuz everything daylyt said went over everyone's head  😂😂🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
They answered Kendrick's call
They need to drop a album together atp
The sample used in this song is Brazilian from the singer Cassiano in the song Castiçal, it's a classic! BANG BANG . BRAZILLLLLLLLLLL
Dangerous as the king of pop how well they spin your block, no moves minimal smooth criminals they whole gang doing insane amount of lean. 🔥😤
Cole will never ever be dismissed not in my eyes. He’s my fav and always will remain as my fav. If you’re still talking about the apology more fool you, you can’t take his goat status away because of that.   Cole shows a level of maturity a lot of people do not possess. You have to operate on a certain level in life and in the real world of what really matters outside of the ‘entertainment’ to understand his actions.   His pen game is strong! You can’t take that away! Cole is Cole! And it’s a breath of fresh air in the midst of the madness and ppl selling their souls for the bs! Cole is grounded. Dreamville 4L💙
Cole is in his prime
where are drums?
Daylyt went so crazy. Daylyt so dangerous with this word play. Cole still immortal as always .
He’s back !!!!!!
Cole... Wow. 😲. Daylyt brought out a very Cole world.
😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
I wish he never said nothing to that man. He didn't have to.
📶
Damn, this was fuego. 🔥 I wanted an encore in the form of the beat dropping and a 2nd verse from both of them.
IDC,  Cole better than Kendrick….. Kendrick hides behind a good beat.
DAYLYT BODIED THIS 🔥🔥🔥🔥😮‍💨I HOPE HE MAKES MORE SONGS LIKE THIS 🔥🔥
Cole... wtf???
think I won’t drop the location, I still got ptsd
Better come with EP, this ain't enough Cole & Day!
Why do people get on a song with Cole and feel like they gotta rap all extra lyrical
They mirroring each other from different worlds and environments they setting a tone for us blackmen 😅 and telling our stories so that we can understand us better and so others could learn
They ate this mf up like a plate of collard greens too! 😅
lets go been waiting for a new song
Lets be honest, the beat trash
J. Cole all day, every day!  🙇🏾‍♂️😫🙌🏾 Shout out from South Africa. 💯
This is the type of cole we fell in love with. It sounds a bit too forced though. I wish his delivery was a little more chill
Bednar Ports
2:29 💔
IDGAF WHAT ANYBODY SAYS COLE STILL THE COLDEST IN MY OPINION ONG !!!!
THIS is how you know Cole wasn’t scared of the battle
They praise God but Satan is the one who cadence there dreams ‼️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥵
Dumpster juice
Goat status, if you disagree you can find a thick kind to choke on.
i love how lyt with his poematic flow smoothly walked us to cole who lately is showing that he can rap with the best of the best  damnnn what a song  Cole u a b*tch for this beef sh*t tho u cant apologize
That's the J.cole i wanna hear 🔥
Walker Elizabeth Williams Shirley Jones Barbara

COLE A REAL ONE FOR DOING WHTA WAS IN HIS HEART. HE FELT LIKE 7 minute drill was not in tune with what he feels. HOMIE APOLOGIZED. TAKES BALLS TO DO THAT SHIT....
They’re back💪🏾🔥🫡, p.s. who should’ve thought ab soul would kill this too😢
Oh my Cole 🫡
J Cole up and Daylyt up definitely jeezz fire 🔥🔥🔥

Ahaha I like the background in Portuguese though. Cole doesn’t miss at all 💙. Master chef of words.
I ❤ this song and the collaboration. Good Hip Hop, like a plate of collard greens that sticks to the bones. 🎉
Jeez
When the talent is truly yours, the controversies eventually fade. I knew Cole would be just fine. Still and has always been well ahead of Drake to me.
Now this is hip hop two goats
Got a channel thought cuz Damn the cable off it seems
🧾
my guy stole J Cole flow😂😂😂
Cole stepped out the beef because he’s killing every single one of them and he truly wants peace
This ain’t it
Y’all Ain’t Even Listening To Daylyt 😭💯
Daylyt on the track makes sure you on ya A game lyrically
Gotta channel thoughts cus the cable out it seems
Y’all all talking about Cole. You missed it.
LET HIM COOK!!!!!!!!!🔥🔥

LYRICS:  Yeah P, I see you Oh, this shit feel like- You know that feelin' when-? Yeah  Just pray for me on the third It's a body chopped in thirds, I heard A lot of sheep in the circle And you the goat, the Judas comin' to purge It hurt him everytime you splurge All this time spent, the mind sent, the haters envy It make me happy knowin' they can never touch me I tackle every goal he made, they think we playin' rugby The rug be in the Ghost look like a floor at the haunted house Six hunnid thousand on two hunnid acres, I know it hurt 'em bad Paparazzi peek, we close the curtains I know it hurt 'em, mad Yeah, this like a verse that the pastor gave from the pulpit They matador me but I ain't here for the bullshit Never stress who they gon' bless today I knew I'd get a mil', I came from Section 8, ain't stressed a plate, yeah The rest is greatness, it's history in the makin' His story he makin' Take it into fact that we was taken Placed inside the trap, tapped with laxatives and we think that we runnin' shit? Relax and relapse, dope lift up a hunnid clips Some blocks turn haunted, growth stunted Like Barnum and Bailey, hard for the babies Clownin' and drownin' they surroundings if an opp out Backseat of the police car but never cop out The pole too long to stop doubtin', for better days The sun bright out, children, let it raise If you hear this, keep your head up, praise, go  Go Go Yeah Uh  The reign is obsolete, Jermaine is out, the beast Celebrated, paraded out in the streets for days, if not for weeks For bringing us out the bleakest, burning pit My words is slick, when it's my turn to kick I apply pressure like I'm trained to stop a leak How vain is my belief? To say that I could be the greatest y'all done seen With my cadence proper, from days I laid across the street From these Caucasian neighbors, new kids I stayed around I'd green and not as mean as my homies that played on project swings What fate has not foreseen My brain stained, engrained with the stories of slain bodies from heinous robberies And rated R regimes, exchanging raw for cream Tricked 'em and went left, they pull up shootin' like Tatum off a screen The bills is due, as kids we knew the way the calls would ring Since mom ain't paid 'em off, we trained to watch the names across the screen And let collections pass just like we failed to make an offering Gotta channel thoughts 'cause damn, the cable off, it seems Deep down, I hated Halloween, with all that I have seen Who needs another way to cause a scream? Dangerous as the king of pop, how well they spin your block No moves, minimal, smooth criminals The whole gang doin' insane amount of lean This ain't prescribed 'cause there's no doc' for pain they harboring Some pray to God, but it's odd, 'cause Satan's catered all their dreams Spiritually malnourished, dehydrated, now they feign For truth in these flows, food for they souls, to make it all serene, uh Well, here's a plate of collard greens (Uh), yeah  Listen to my song "I'll Be Me" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiA8ZkYaTdg
“Gotta (channel) thoughts, cause damn, the (cable) off, It seems” 😤
This the old Cole we wanted back!
Cole world 🔥🔥🔥
J.cole the modern day Pac
That bar starting @ 2:40 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Eh.
You could write a thesis on the things he said but he puts it together so slick its hard to pick apart he said so many things...😮
Cole world no blanket!
Boring 🥱
God flow
Cole and dot Shaq and Kobe. Legends of thier era, not similar enough to compare. Both dominate the game in thier own different ways, Cole done rapped his ass off again.
Daylyt is the best writer ever 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Cole made his side clear, the real is back...
It's a cool collab but nothing exceptional (in my opinion).
I don’t understand how one can call themselves a fan of rap/hip hop and say Cole Isn’t top 3 or 5. Like…open your ears😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
J. COLE IS THE GREATEST TO EVER DO ITTT😧🔥
YES DAYLYT IS FINALLY GETTING HIS FLOWERS 🙌🙌🙌🙌
Cole is the goat fuck y’all taking about
ill never believe if j cole says anything about being the best or king after ducking the fade which i believe he would have won if he fr stepped in the ring you aint the best if you prove it and he will never liver it down ij my eyes but thats just my crappy opinon
The Greatest of this Era Top 5 of all time Jermaine Lamarr Cole “The Fall Off” 🔜
What sample
Cole apologized and got to keep his career so he decided to flex on this HARD
Shout out to Devon Campbell!!   They didn’t understand the method to the madness
Nahhhh I don’t think yall understand these two really gave these young new gen pop, rap,rock whatever genre’s A PLATE OF COLLARD GREENS🐐🐐🐐🐐🔥🔥🔥
J cole is #2. Undisputed Kendrick #1. Aint no three just a bunch of aging goats sending that ancestral energy to the current 2
"That we think that we running shit" bar was some heat
Cole was above average. But “All” that Greatest talk is 😂😂😂   DOT punk both. They Buried Alive
Jcole with verse of the year so far
Loving the HUNGER, the game’s been missing passion and spirit
Like this comment if you skipped to j Cole part lol
This excuses grippy.
King Cole ❤
Daylyt is j cole of battle rap
WTF
"dangerous as the king of pop, how well they spin the block, no moves minimal, smooth criminals, the whole game doing insane amount of lean" 🐐
Man fuk k dot he's not even comparable with j cole ,ps that's my personal opinion if u dont like it u can simply fuk offf🥰🖕🏽
Se Deus quiser, amanhã você verá o seu AMOR! S2 BR.
Dope. 2024 is a turning point back to real rap.
I personally hate J. Cole. But thank you for bringing Daylyt to the masses
J.Cole just rapped one of the best verses of his career that shit was dumb
Cole will always & forever be the goat rapper in my eyes!
THE GOAT
Szzmmooth criminals
Cole is a whole b*tch at this point. the amount of switch up is crazy
24 September 2024 Collard greens  dropped  Still alive breathing applying pressure. Who alive.?
Collard greens
Colin Kendrick is like my type too. I really can't pick a number one cuz both of them hit different. Is Kendrick more influential? Yes he is but Cole always been that Lyricist to me
Yo J Cole is The GOAT
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Cole is him
Glad people are waking back up
Gotta channel thoughts cause the cable off it seems.
I knew id get a mill (meal) i came from section 8 (ate)
These dudes just bodied it bad🔥🔥🔥
🎵🎵🎵
Acapella J Cole might be something
The apology for this song is about to be crazzzzzyy
How can yall hold this man accountable for being a Grown Man. What Cole did was grown man shit. Great Song Daylyt .
Loving this! Both Cole and Daylyt killed it. Lyte’s punchlines are crazy.   If Drake would have spit what Lyt spit on this track, peeps would have been loosing their minds.
J cole & Daylyt 🔥 Benny the butcher & Conway the machine 🔥 Ransome & 38 spesh🔥 These are the best duos to ever Collab 💯💯🙌🙌🔥🔥
Sensational
I got better bars on my channel
My Goat Cole on the loose 🔥🔥 also I am becoming a big fan of Daylyt bro bars be over heads
Both verses are great Cole is in his final form this is insane
Life of Pi is the best track on Might Delete Later so Cole spun the block.
Cole is the 🐐
Daylyt is just different..I don't feel like this is his final form.
Yuhh🔥🔥🔥
THE REAL IS BACK THE VILLE IS BACK
J Cole made the apology make since
This is old. Just an FYI
“This ain’t prescribed cause there’s no doc for pain they harboring, some pray to God but it’s odd cause satan’s catered all their dreams” Damn GOAT😭😮‍💨🤦🏾‍♂️
J Cole is hands down THE greatest rapper of our time and is definitely creeping to top 3 of all time. 🔥🐐🎤
COLE RAPPING LIKE THE RENTS DUE 😭🔥🔥🔥
Cole allowing daylyt to be on tracks proves he is goated writing ✍️
Cole crushed this Eminem vibes with those rhyme schemes which is a massive compliment The Fall Off will be special 🙏😊
TAKES ONE TO KNOW BOUT LYT
DAYLYT IS THE TRUE GOAT HERE
Thank you for inspiring me!
Wow
I wanna feed the streets,  like crumbs dropping from the teeth of the elite after leaving the windows  of the drive-thru.  I want to soothe the hunger for blood. There is no love between crips and pyrus.  Drugs and slugs are impossible to digest.  Junkies roaming blocks to find food.  We are lied to in the hood as if there cannot be good. I've been tricked too. I was mostly influenced by dealers and pimps and stick-up crews.  Everyone else was too nervous to be seen.  So, the plates being served came with a lust for green and negativity.  While traveling, the bums would rub there gums, asking the kids for treats.  Everyday seemed like walking dead of Halloween.  I saw people ask for their fix before a cup of water to drink.  Lips were cracked like the product they hit. Now the addiction could turn solid morals into horrible fixtures of crime.  Women selling their pussy for a high and  men breaking into houses of accountants to fund their wine.  I grew up watching these fiends and for awhile this is what inspired me as a child.  I admit, I was wild.  I started selling crack cocaine and joined a gang.  I saw bullets press into the lungs of the brightest kids.  15 is too young to die from the emptying of clips.  Sometimes the drive-by was because of colors.  Statements made by the same things that painters use while mixing their hues.  Different statements made,  one creates art  and the other creates graves.  Eventually,  the ailment of poor choices  made sense to me.  I had to go jail and face prison before I realized I wanted to make a change.  This is God's dream  and now my aim is to reclaim the streets.
Bars is back 🔥
Cole might of just got out rapped 🤷🏾‍♂️
Anytime i see daylyts name i instantly think of him in that blonde wig lol
omg cole killlllllllleeedddd it
Nothing wrong with being #2. Cole🙌🏾
Nah, the world ain't ready for this kind of J Cole. He is writing rhythm and poetry in a whole another dimension.
Jermaine Lamar Cole....They Could Never Make Us Switch Up🎉
“Dangerous as the king of pop, how well they spin your block No moves, minimal, smooth criminals The whole gang doin' insane amount of lean” JESUS CHRIST BROOOOO
Daylyt killed this shit... J. COLE that dude to get on a track with him twice...😂
This was hard
I also don’t care that anyone’s says he’s the GOAT in his generation of rappers. The moment he folded to K dot he crowned him the GOAT of their generation. So he needs to stop with his braggadocio lines, because he won’t be the GOAT, unless he competes & snatch the crown to K dot. Don’t get me wrong Cole is nice w/ his pen. But hip hop is a competitive sport!!!
🎧🐐
Sample "Castiçal - Cassiano", one more Brazilian Music sample in a mainstream music, first 21 with Redrum, now cole.
I’m glad daylyt finally getting his shine in the music industry he deserve it great rapper
brazilian sample..!
Yo daylyte went off
Cole 🔥😮‍💨
Fantastic!
They’ve done it twice this year, this was a duo I never expected but glad we got it.
Daylty come back to battle rap
COLE WRLD
This feel like a album song ngl, really good song man.
"Dangerous as the king of pop 👑"
Cole easy up bruh 😩💪
“They mad adore(matador) me but i aint here for the bullshit” Mmmmmmmm!!!😤🔥
Kendrick got every rapper making sure each of their bars have meaning and I'm hear for it!!
“So pray to God but it’s odd, since Satan’s catered all they dreams “🤦🏽‍♂️
Nice
✌️😇✨️♦️
Yessir!!
Ok 🦾
Datpiff😢
Once it’s Cole I’m there.

I always had faith Cole would show us that he’s really like that🔥
🔥🔥🔥

Dominic Crescent

Everybody hyping Cole but let's get some likes for Daylyt y'all 👍
BRO THAT MICHAEL JACKSON WORD PLAY IS CRAZY DUM
cole is the goat 🐐 what an insane rhyme scheme
Brazilian sample on this song goes wild😮❤
Dalyt did his thing.
“Gotta channel thoughts cause the cable’s off, it seems.” Just wow!!! 🤯💯👍🏾
Beat is kinda whack, no progression whatsoever.   Glad for the lyrical effort though.
ColeWorld No Blanket!
P I (PI) see you.. First thing off this dudes mouth reference Might Delete Laters PI they both was on..
Cassiano sample 😮
i love where rap is at right now...
DAYLYT MISSING THE AB-SOUL VERSE TO MAKE THE SONG COMPLETE
Is this freeway beat? Shit sound so familiar
Cole is the goat, ain't no wolf eating him.
GRIPPY
Thank god we got this Cole back😮‍💨
Now this is hip-hop!!!
I love my ghetto hip hop to death. But nothing hit like a flurry of bars on a Tuesday
People calling Cole the goat while Daylyt just showed a different level 😅 Cole nasty tho. It's Dot and Cole when it comes to the industry then its everybody else.
Ahhhhhhhh
Cole always kill Dalyt slept on big tym
Nobody is rapping better than Cole right now. He's been ahead of the line since his feature run and he's not letting up either!
This needs to drop asap!
⛽️⛽️⛽️⛽️⛽️⛽️
People really gatta stop acting like cole ain’t HIM…..lyrical genius
When Daylyt said "Go" he made it a double entendre by telling the GOAT to Go.
i guess real RAP Is ALIVE the party died 😊
Cole out here still.killing tracks
I never counted Cole out for one second. People will still hold that apology over his head but he did what was best for him, and that's all that matters. Forever a 🐐🐐🐐
Sounds like that samo rapper to me ...
You just can't have enough real hip-hop, the culture needs healing
THIS IS THE SHT I BEEN STARVING FOR 😢
❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ok, we need an album just y'all 2 🙏
the only time J.Cole Applies pressure is when he's filling his bike tires with air...lol
Does anyone else get angry when u Kno coles verse is almost over???
“This ain’t prescribed cuz theres no doc for pain they harboring. Some pray to god but it’s odd cuz satans catered all their dreams.”    Poetry.
When it’s my turn a kick (tourniquet) I apply pressure like I’m trained to stop a leak 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I knew I'd get a mil (meal), I came from section 8...................dayum
Jcole 😂 is fucking nice yo 💯
Cole just reminding everyone, daylyt killed it too
Quill
Oh lawd he done did it again😮‍💨
When it’s my turn to kick I apply pressure like I’m training to stop elite 🧱🔥🐐
Theres just no way anybody believes cole couldnt destroy someone in a rap battle if he truly wanted to. That man pulled out of that battle because he respected kendrick. Not because he couldnt go toe to toe with him.
Yooo the title on the cover is written by ScHoolboy Q!
"let collection pass like we fail to make an  offering " the goat
Garbage lol sorry
There's no goal in rugby just tries. Nice try though Daylyt
Idec if J cole went cold on this, man cant rate that guy aint gunna lie
cole switched teams😭
The bar in hip hop has just been raised!!!
You butchered the sound quality by ripping it off.
Nah, Cole really rhymed with the title of this track  'Plate of Collard Greens" throughout his whole entire verse... & it honestly makes me mad, because I still truly feel like he could've gotten both Kendrick & Drake with the diss songs.
Is this real??
IDC what nobody say Cole the GOAT to me
Shoulda dropped the drums 😢
Daylyt is literally the lyrical GOAT idgaf what no one says
ITS ITS ITS 🤔GRIPPY🥶
“They mad adore me but I ain’t here for the bullshit”
this shit hard
33 right out the gate
🔥🔥🔥
Give me the beat lol
Bars🙌
im here
They mad adore (matador) me but I ain't here for the bullshit
I'll have a plate of pulled pork, collards, hush puppies with cornbread please.
🫡
🔥🔥🔥
Cole is *chefs kiss* as per usual
Daylyt and Cole??? I already this gon be 🔥🔥
"The rest is greatness, it's history in the making" 👏
Let's goo
🤔
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Here first 😮
