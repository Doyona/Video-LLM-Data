Remember This iconic Line - ''THE DEVIL DOESN’T KNEEL BEFORE FALSE ANGELS'' 🔥
Where is the season 5 trailer?
SEASON 5 TRAILER?????
me watching this again waiting in agony for s5 trailer to come out
Ok where’s the season 5 trailer?
A local blind man going toe-to-toe with an Asgardian God… he really is a good lawyer ⚖. Huge shoutout to the animators, GIVE THEM A RAISE 🙌. Marvel, we need a whole series in this animation style. Let the devil out is such a banger line. This has got to be my FAVORITE season trailer so far. Angela and Daredevil both look incredible! 🔥🐉
Super helpful video! Really enjoyed it. 😊
Super helpful video! Thanks for sharing.
Wow, this is awesome! Keep it up!
1:04 Still badass one month later
fire
Weak ahh hiroshima game
Bro she talk about fear bros literally a blindman whos beaten up a guy that never misses multiple times, sorry but Angela DareDevil is everyones fear and nightmare
Why is every other character Overpowered but Widow is not   BUFF BLACK WIDOW !!!!
who is letting these animators cook like this, this is some straight unethical ball ✋😭🤚
Give us a better cloak and dagger skin
LET THE DEVIL.. OUT!!!
I love Daredevil
BRING NIGHTWATCH AND CARTER SLADE TO THE GAMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
CAN WE PLEASE HAVE A SHOW AROUND THIS??! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DISNEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?
I don’t really know where to post it so I’ll just post this here, there’s tons of people just quick play boosting their account to level 300 so they can get infinite currency. They go into quick play and match against another six stack team and they just shoot at each other for an hour. I don’t even understand how this is fun for them, but I’ve seen this one dude do it for nonstop 40 hours and I think y’all might have a gameplay problem here. I’m sure Marvel loves it because it makes the game look like it has crazy amounts of traffic. But in reality, nobody’s even playing half of the servers are just taken up by AFK bots, now I have to wait 2 1/2 minutes just to find a quick match. The state of this game is getting worse.
just weird to see Angela without spawn , apparently  marvel owns the rights to her now
Phenomenal design on all fronts love love Angela and her gameplay
The way he said it here should have been the way it is when he ults
01:10 Let the devil... OOUUUUUUUUUUT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
0:49 Lord icon
okay we see you jinwoo you dont gotta aura farm here to
Surrender to the hand of heaven
Absolute cinema ✋😐🤚
Noob question what are the spirit abimal things they are channeling?
Why didn't they add this version oh him saying "let the devil" it sounds better compared to the shorter faster version in game.
✋🗿🤚Peak
Daredevil VA putting his heart and soul into his voice acting. Love it.
the season is fire. kunlun map is amazing.
1:02   0:51
The Animation team definitely needs a huge raise for creating such perfection
In all seriousness this gave me literal goosebumps, made me stand up all hyped and jumping around, the animation went crazy. Marvel is really going all out This is just pure PEAKNESS
I hope they put Ghost Rider in the game soon, Johnny Blaze specifically.
Whose here after Necros?
Release more strategies and tanks skew the dps
YOOO WATCHING THIS NOW AFTER ANGELA IS OUT AND THE DAREDEVIL GAMEPLAY   THEY ACTUALLY GAVE SOO MANY EASTER EGGS ANGELAS ULT TETHERING AND DAREDEVILS BLINDING ULT WITH THE HAND SYMBOL OVER HER HEAD ❤❤❤   I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH 😭
What is my lawyer doing 🎋😭
Daredevil gives me goosebumps
a layer btw 😭🙏
Angela has the blindness mark from his ult after dardevil sys his ult voice line. That's so cool.
0:02 why this sound like old cod game loading up😂
PEAK!
once again the xbox one is out
Can we get 4 player team up back in comp platinum and higher?
Strong outro catchphrases create memorable identity
this trailer has no reason going this hard
1:12 that scream gave me an intense amount of goosebumps. Something I only get from intense transformations in anime like ssj3 and UI Goku
Did anyone notice the mark on angelas head at 1:17? That might be part of dare devils base kit.
I think they are going to give nocturn R ability to dare devil.
We need that daredevil punisher team up
8 million views is crazy
The season is terrible
I need Ghost Rider in this Game please
We need more trailers like this for rivals
That's not daredevil, that's...ABSOLUTE DAREDEVIL
0:20 that'd be a cold mvp cosmetic
Fix your game i don't like getting my pc bricked and points deducted
1:12
Holy impact frames bro, and godly writing. Hella voice acting. this is peak
Worth it
Nao ia lancar para ps4?
It would be based if NetEase used Bring Me to Life by Evanescence for the Daredevil gameplay trailer.
We need the Kingpin
Mf flying further than iron man and star lord
How Tf you limited everyone else flying beside Angela smh that’s stupid ASF and plus she a vanguard like make it make sense
If "LET THE DEVIL OUTTTTT!!!!" isnt his ult line, im gonna flip
trash matchmaking
“The devil doesn’t keep a positive kd”
Trash game. Dead game. Addict's game.
I wanna see a anime with these type of graphics
m read that right did say ps4 🤯
Lawyer vs spawn character
If this is Dd's base model its peak
awesome!
Get rid of the bots in qp
01:03
Marvel is starting to fall off
daredevil getting anime MC treatment wasn't on my list for this year, but i'm kinda in for it
Marvel rivals pls for the love of god give Jeff an firefighter legendary skin it will be so good and cute Jeff with a firefighter hat and clothes it will be fire and he can have firefighter truck as an emote a mini one or as an MVP PLS do it marvel ❤
please make MVC2 gambit character next!!
Please launch this game for mobile to🥲
Nobody gonna talk about this game is coming for PS4???
Let the devil OUTTT!!
Still many heroes and vaillian are not in the selection, Many are soon.
no one talkin' ab the weird hand above angela when he lets the devil out. prolly makes other people blind too with the way she was swinging around at the smoke
cross progression when? i just wanted my battle pass skins from s0-s3 on my console to my pc
Ok fix the graphics on ps4 like ps5
Easily the worst season so far.  Made me uninstall.  The devs claim they don't use EOMM, which just means they're incompetent vibe programmers because the matchmaking is horrible.
Hell yeah
How did you defeat Odin's daughter? - I'm a really good lawyer
Pls release the game on  switch 2
Animação muito fd slk
Absolute cinema
Fix the game,some of us have PC Handhelds like The Rog Ally and Steamdeck,also I just want to play the game,not Update Drivers every season,Unreal Engine 5 was a Mistake
ALL the goosebumps when DD unleashed his Ult 😮‍💨
im gonna play with my eyes closed and tell my teammates that im lore accurate daredevil and not a throwe
Gigantic Theme is Playing on Season 4 background music wtf😂😂😂😂😂
Idk what tf you guys have done for optimization on ps5 but it feels worse and the is FPS drops and screen jittering
jjs hollow purple sound at 0:47
Hear me out Ben 10 remake with this art style 🙏🏾😭🥹
Is it coming out on Xbox?
I'm just going to say it right now I really hope his ultimate makes him turn into a dragon cuz that red dragon in the mist looked sick 😝😝
May I ask if it will be available on consoles? And if yes on wich ones?
is anyone missing their season 3 and 3.5 ranked rewards? I didn't get mine and one of my friends in GM didn't either. wonder if its a bug 🤔
So this is why my parents wanted me to become a lawyer 😮 1:04
Why first added angela we want daredevil 😭
Fix your PC launch bug. It's been there since launch, and every workaround gets wiped every update. Like, seriously. It's embarrassing.
What about Xbox One players 😢🥀💔
0:24 Di zang?
What Are They even fighting for 😭🙏🙏
Es hoy es hoy!
Angela seems like a fun and fantastic addition. Not a fan of you adding another melee aimbot, like DareDevil but I'm so glad this had nothing to do with Ironfist. Was worried that's all it was going to be with it being the Heart of the Dragon.
Fix your matchmaking
0:52 Raging Demon Button
OMG Daredevil 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
These new season trailers are getting even more sick!
“The devil doesn’t switch when going 0-9.”
What happened to street level Daredevil 😭😭😭 this guy can fight Thor now bro
woahh
Agora sim ps4 ❤❤
Lets go ps4
So looks like one of Daredevil’s abilities is to blind opponents?
alright looks like im getting back into marvel rivals
Correct me if I’m wrong but apparently the daredevil we see is Matt Murdock but possessed  by a demon dragon called dizang who is the guardian of the eighth city, dizang role is the at he redeems souls in hell and like I said he possesses Matt’s body and gives him powers.
Marvel rivals plz add free moon knight black recolor skin for 600 credit,like he has no free skins,just because the recolor was in battle pass,plz put it in the store,tnx
He did say he’s a good lawyer, even against angels
DROP DAREDEVIL SOONER PLEASE 🙏🏼
They’re cooking Daredevil and Angela is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🫡
I'm not familiar with Angela, could someone explain why she only has one wing?
Why they need to make everything Asian themed even daredevil suit 💀
Vro when was lawyers able to do ts???😭
Ts is so gas 🔥they powered up and rocked ts
Season 5 can we get green goblin
Ps4!!!!!! Damn we are still getting good . LONG LIVE MY TRUSTY PS4🎉
Ps4: "I don't heard no bell"
Optional crossplay for pc is needed! Console players need to stay in their lobbies.  Until then, console players turn off crossplay.
Omg 🥰
Bro ur client cant be that special 😭
PS4 : IM STILL STANDING
YES DAREDEVIL IVE BEEN WAITING FOR HIM!!!!
Nobody has been pointing out that DD left a mark on Angela after his attack. Could be a huge clue as to what his kit will be capable of
"Let the devil... cryyyyyyy" he may daredevil. He may.
this trailer alone is better than all current marvel movies.
PS4???
Can I get a marvel anime series from the creatives behind this trailer. Cause...damn
1:07 why he smiling like that
Demolidor não tanka a irmã do Thor!😂
Anyone else get Asura's Wrath vibes from DD's animations?
That is no Valkyrie that’s an angel
New status effect?? 1:16  there is a hand eye logo above her head and she was blind
Is Daredevil the bad guy in this? Angela in the comics is arguably an anti-hero, but in Rivals she is defending K'un-Lun to protect her infant sister. Why is Daredevil attacking the city?
Anyone else notice the little Red hand appear above Angelo after he finished screaming LDO? I wonder how that plays into the game
Ps4 ❤
I don’t know why but Asura’s Wrath vibes radiate in this animation
Im gonna need a whole spinoff show with all of this. Art style, animation, voice actors. I need it all now
Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon reference
Hope they stay this good forever man
Was that Alex Le again!?!?
Comment section: Everyone: Daredevil!!!! Me: When was Marvel Rivals on the PS4?
I bet that's his Ult dialogue.  "LET THE DEVIL... RISEE!!"
Absolute cinema
Awesome animation, the trailer is very exciting to watch.
"The Devil does not kneel before false angels"   Who wrote this? I want to personally shake his hand for the amount of coldness that line was.
whos lawyer is this
Wtf why they are keep making battle scenes instead of an actual new season trailer
WHEN did daredevil do ts bruh
common aleks le w
“The devil doesn’t kneel before false angels” goes so hard
If daredevil is a support character I'm gonna run naked all over the entire world
PS4?
Yall better give Aleks Le his flowers. Every word was tough af.
Fix your matchmaking.
peak
Hang on is dare devil voiced by aleks le
Daredevil NEEDS to say that “the devil doesn’t kneel before false angels” line whenever he finishes Angela.
Vai, Marvel, cozinhe para nós
God bless this company
Ok James P. Sullivan from Monster Inc and Creepy Eyes Angela 1:12 1:20
Bro, they didn't have to go this hard with DD and Angela but they did any ways 😭😭
An animation series would go crazy, just saying🤣
Since when did Daredevil have a little dragon in inside of him 😮
Don’t some frames look like straight out of berserk panels?
Rengoku vs Akaza ah fight
Why does the "the devil doesn't kneel" line reminds me of the "lion doesn't concern" meme
What is my lawyer doing🙏
So while these two fight over Hela, Iron Fist gunna be dealing with Doom, well, good luck Fist, you will certainly need it.
Alexs lee is killing it
DAREDEVILLLLLLLLL
Aleks Le MY GOAT 🗣🔥🔥🔥
Daredevil’s voice actor needs praise, “the devil doesn’t kneel before false angels” is such a cold line
They need to add ghost rider in season 5 just because it would be peak
I swear, Marvel really need to make a series with this type of animation!
That "let the devil out" scene reminds me so much of devil man crybaby Amon transformation.
Kinda annoying how theirs only two free skins. I know “buy the battle pass” but basically everything in this game is to buy now instead of earn and it’s getting kinda annoying I started the game about 8 month ago and was happy that I would earned the character skin points then used them felt like I earned it. It was way easier back then. You know what’s wanting two character skins this season and having to waiste $50 Idrc but come on now each character skins is basically $20. I wish atleast every season there was a way to earn more character tokens without spending more money. Or jsut new character skins when you reach lord. Each time you win a little boost of character tokens or something free it’s getting ridiculous how expensive the game actually is becoming without really having anything winnable.
1:10 anyone else just get chills, because that line delivery was amazing. Not to mention the animation was just god tier. To this day Rivals keeps on delivering.
Man, I never knew this lawyer was this good, wow what a good lawyer
1:34 THANK YOU!! NOW MY PS4 SLIM WILL EXPLODE IN A WORTHY WAY!!!
THIS IS SO FUCKING SICK 😭
Daredevil better have a team up with Spider-Man
Please make a different perspective for Daredevil. It shouldn't look the same as playing all the other characters
Bro got that jin wooo in him
So they took some liberties with Daredevil lol
aleks le is perfect to voice daredevil
Gess I cold use that line wen my rage wants a fight LET THE DEVIL OOOOOUT
Man I have school next day of this I can't playD;
Why Angela? I just don't get it.
0:44 better be in his kit.
FIRE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Oh man, this is beautiful.
Venom needs a buff
Venom needs a buff
Venom needs a buff
daredevil really said: ARGHH I WONT LET YOU DESTROY MY WORLDDDDDDDD!!!!!!
When you finally nerf Iron-man and other flying nonsense - then we will talk. Now - nhah.  Just pick iron man and 190/s enemy team. I mean 1.5 second for 300 health is a pretty good rate of killing.
nah the Rivals team need to make an original series in this animation style because THIS IS PEAK CINEMA RIGHT HERE
Marvel is very much capable of this level of animation for a show but choose  not to why????
Animation team wanted their payday
That final panel was straight up Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Love it!!!! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 🐅🐉
Umm since when is Dardevil magic? 😂 Whatever this is awesome!
the heartbeat at the end🤪🤪🤪
I love how the music is just path to rivals but eastern-ified
If I flat out threw this to someone who doesn't know about Marvel rivals, he/she would think it's a new movie or series
"THE DEVIL DOESNT KNEEL BEFORE FALSE ANGELS" HITS HARD
He's a really good lawyer
Isn’t the devil a false angel tho?
Arcane art style
What was the mark above Angela’s head
A lawyer dressed like a devil fighting an angry battle axe angel  There’s a poem in there somewhere 🧐 😂
Can't wait to put my audio on zero for that IMMERSION...
1:12 Devilman Crybaby reference??
hows the gameplay? is my screen just gonna be black coz hes blind
Went all out with the animation. Felt like watching an anime movie.  Also Daredevil is here!!
1:17 she said the thing, she said it (men without fear)
They got me crying they turned him to a DPS us healers can't have nothing
Do i have to fight Gna again?
I have watched this a dozen times. Will be watching it dozens more too 💝
What is this version of daredevil?? And will we be getting him in the game? I would love to play me some daredevil
Correct me if I’m wrong, but I think this is the same Angel that went toe to toe with Spawn
Overwatch is free
Its coming on the ps4. Finally
I am literally starting to draw after a big rut after I saw Daredevil's tough ass frame and line of "Let the Devil out".
Ps4 yea ❤
ALEKS LE VOICING OMG BEST DAY EVER W RIVALS
God damn, those impact frames
Meters you beautiful bastards I freaking love you guys. 🥲like just take my money right now
wait ! ALEX LEE!!!!!!
"ALEKS STOP AURA FARMING YOU'RE NOT VOICING JIN WOO!!"
Daredevil really putting the devil part of his name in good light
Please tell me Daredevil ult line is him saying “LET THE DEVIL OUT”
It's been way too long since I got goosebumps and thrill over an animation, but holy hell this hit the sweet spot. Imagine watching a movie with this quality of sound, animation, choreography, impact and voice acting.
I could be your Angela or your Daredevil
Why would they even do that bro ps4 will play on 30 fps so why even bother making us excited :(
Ps4😍❤
When you use power up but the rival boss can do it too
Law by mike going super sayan
an ACE ATTORNEY vs a god
"The Devil doesn't kneel before false angels" 🗣️🗣️
Bro is also blind like what
Sung Jin devil goes hard asf
Please use the song End of you by Amy Lee , Poppy and Courtney for this game y'all
That's cool and all, but can I play Rank with my friends now?
Hey NetEase, we're good on DPS characters. We need more supporte
Aleks le as daredevil is crazy
WTH no cross play still
*Okay fine I'll try it, then*
Literal super saiyan scream
Literal super saiyan scream
Angela - A Literal God - “Surrender to the Hand of Heaven!” Daredevil: I DIDN’T HEAR NO BELL.
"I'm gonna come." - DT
PS4 release is sick, I can't afford a PS5 and my PS4 runs pretty much fine, so I'm so damn excited  Also Daredevilllll <33
This was very cool
are we gonna not ignoring that it comes on PS4 💀💀💀
0:08 Zane’s bird playable in marvel rivals now?
We need a show with this animation Marvel 😭
No one gonna talk about ps4 is gonna release on the marvel rival in September 12th too
If your actions were permitted by God… He wouldn’t have sent the Devil.
SUNG JIN WOOO!!!
IS THAT ALEKS LE
“The Devil doesn’t kneel before false angels” goes pretty hard not gonna lie.
IS THAT ALEX LE VOICING DAREDEVIL?!
NetEase didn’t have to go this hard with the animation 😮  Calling “Let the devil out!” to be Daredevil’s ult line. His ult will be a blinding effect that only lets you and your team see.
0:33 is that my goat Aleks Lee?
I wasn’t counting on Daredevil getting in, this is great. I wasn’t expecting him to get in this game cause I think he would be similar to Moon Knight. This shows how much the devs care about variety, a huge roster and how far they are willing to stretch the boundaries.
I can’t wait to see DD interactions with Spidey and Wolverine, his 2 pals.
This is the greatest animation I have ever seen them do so far. They made a street level hero aura farm on a goddess saying, "LET THE DEVIL OUT," I already love Daredevil, but net ease animation knows how to make me crazy over characters even more.
Was that hela's bird?
Man this trailer is so good lore and all. The asgardians are “powerful gods” but the lawyer that dresses up as a devil is raised in a Catholic household so there is only one god in his eyes leading to the line “the devil doesn’t kneel before false angels” is so fn peak. Season 4 needs to be dropped already
Infinite flight vanguard but no Jeff infinite swim is hypocritical... RESTORE JEFF
I’m really sorry, but I think the team that designed the skins in your game has some issues. They don’t seem to have any sense of fashion or color matching at all. Please change it.
For anyone who doesn't know Angela is from the Spawn comics and 10 years ago marvel made her Thor's sister!
This comes out on my birthday id say this is a WONDERFUL gift
Alex Lee back at it again
THIS IS NOT DAREDEVIL
Sung Rizz-wu as Daredevil is peak
Wow, an actual good animation from Rivals!
bro is not fighting criminal anymore.... hes fighting a literal demigod
Arise...
"False angels" first time I have ever heard that term. Prefect animation on this trailer hope they all this much hype
Daredevil, please just fight someone else!
Who’s playing daredevil because he sounds a lot like Asura from Asura’s Wrath
Daredevil sounds a lot like Aleks Lee (Gamma 1 in DragonBall, Sung Jinwoo in solo Leveling, Zenitsu in Demon Slayer, etc)
Coming ps4 ☠️
1:16 judging by that frame and the gameplay trailer we just got for Angela showing her moves, which was on par with the cinematic (mostly) leads me to believe that daredevils ult will blind people similar to cloaks blind ability (since the hand is above her) which is pretty dope if you ask me 👌
Yall really got Jinwoo for Matt  Peak casting
1:10 absolute cinema
when I stub my toe in the middle of the night 1:12
Fun fact: The person who voices Daredevil in this game is Aleks Le, who happens to also be the voice actor for Salesperson Ena in Ena Dream BBQ and Devil Cookie from Cookie Run Kingdom. Not only that but he also voices Luke in Street Fighter 6.
CAN WE GET ICEMAN ICEMAN ICEMAN
Don't let daredevil get angela in a long hallway
Really interesting that at the 1:14 mark, right after Matt screams (what I can only assume is his ult voice line) Angela has a mark of The Hand over her. Is Matt both the leader of The Hand and defender of the 8th City in this timeline? What a level up.
“let the devil out” gives me literal chills holy thats badass
I thought he was a guy with batons that runs and punches but just way better and hates a fat gang leader
PEAK
best hero reaveals yet, dd alone makes me want to play the game, bros design is perfect and Angela gameplay looked really fun to play
If my lawyer is not willing to fight angels they can leave.
Omfg Aleks Le is Daredevil
PS4??????????
Props to the VA's Really love the Voice work and the animators too, the shot of the ribbons flying towards DD and wrapping him up was amazing. cant wait for season 4
THE ANIMATORS NEVER SLEEP OH MY GODS
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 awesome
Things seem to have changed a lot for Matt in between Born Again seasons 1 and 2
Blind uncle is here... with superpowers!!!??
1:08 he smiles lol
thats not daredevil, daredevil is a human, youre totally losing the character.
0:53 OMG you guys are cooking with daredevil 😳😳😳😭🔥
I like how they bring out the lesser known characters like Angela. My friends started talking about her and looking her up and I'm over here like, "y'all didn't know her?"
Pure Anime Cinema
it's coming on ps4
Let the devil out better be his ultimate voice line hearing that in game would be sick and terrifying asf
Finally proper female representation
I don’t know anything about Angela but I’m pretty sure she kicks Daredevils ahh by a long shot. Like how can he see her up in the air? 🤣
Nah Sung Jinwoo as Daredevil goes hard
Blind Lawyer vs Goddess?   The rivalries are marvellous.
Season 4 is gonna be so coooolll
Rip Ava’s dragon
1:05 so we are blindfolding a blind man
"How can you stand againts gods and monsters?" Daredevil:"Im a really good lawyer"
I’m confused… thought dare devil was just another name for stunt devil. Aka scared of nothing. Not a literal devil
Peak
What that tongue do
I wanna be a va like alek le one day
1:07 when times call for drastic measures, you must....Let The 😈....OOOUUUTTT!!!!!!!!!
I’m officially coming back
I'm a simple dude, I see 'dragon' in the title, and I click.
The animation though!!
1:27 Скажу сразу это реально круто. Сорвиголова - олицетворяет мудрость и силу во блага, т.е. дракона, а Анджела - чистую силу и агрессию, т.е. тигра. Это буквально противостояние тигра и дракона в китайской культуре. Скажу сразу моё почтение.
Yall joking but I think this will be the best season yet
A need is game xbox one pls 😢
Dare devil wth I thought you were a Lawyer🥀🥀🥀
let the devil……..OUT!! Best part of the trailer
Ehhh. I would have preferred a different duo racing off. Feels like two characters just sorta rammed together. Is the villain for the season shadow lands DD? Feels like better choices than Angela are out there. Or if they wanted Angela, better space or Asgard or in general Norse characters to use. Idk, I’m a little burnt on rivals anyway, probably skipping season. Hope the new characters are fun.
I’m about to let out a scream of Primal Joy
Lml what they got DD on 😂😂
Awsome
FINALLY
Daredevil, after he finished watching Devilman.
if u doing aps4 version. Why no Xbox one and switch?
but in-game they go "pew-pew-pew"
THATS MY GOAT ALEKS LE
You are not the ONLY ONE without FEAR!!! That was the toughest line I’ve ever heard from a marvel character and I don’t  know a thing about Angela
ALEKS LE????
is the "let the devil out" a reference to the netflix show or was that a common line in the comics?
Daredevil bout to say "arise"
Dragons. very Chinese.
normal ass guy btw
Dónde está mi Deadpool 😭
1:07 Berserk mode activated, GRIFIIITH!!!
Daredevil Definitely gonna have wall hack as a ability
i keep coming back to this video
when Captain Marvel?
Dayyom, the drawing animation movement, is pretty perfect. You need to do tv series or movies with those characters like this short film, would be fun to watch/more money to you, win win. Better than the marvel movies these days..
GIVE THE ANIMATORS A RAAAAAAIIIISE
Never played. Probably won’t be playing.  But how do you top this animation…
0:52 YO What the yuji itadori?
This ones gonna be a Genji clone fr
False angel... heh, I... I kinda like that.
So am I the only one who noticed the PS4 logo?
Yall cooked 🔥🔥🔥
This trailer is so good, so beautiful that I blinked once during this trailer!
Shame angela was a better character in spawn than she ever was in marvel.
I want to see how the maps look
1:14 Did he just inflict a debuff on her in the trailer? She's got a hand symbol on her head.
Please give us PVE mode a team of 6 surviving on a map Players VS wave after waves after waves of enemys how cool would that be !🤯
Daredevil should be able to detect Invisible Woman
W
1:15 Is that the "Curse of the Hand" above her head?
Anybody else feel like Daredevil is looking particularly beefy? Maybe we'll actually get a double vanguard this season
If they add the Netflix blindfold version of Daredevil, I'm buying it.
He’s a really good lawyer.
Looks like daredevil has a blindness ability
Daredevil sounds like Aleks le from Solo leveling
THEY GOT ALEKS LE FOR DAREDEVIL
LET THE DEVIL   OOOOOOOOOOUUUUUT🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 1:10
At this point gonna need a show like arcane with these visuals
i have never been so hyped for Rivals i need Daredevil now
DAREDEVILLLL!!!
So glad the venom season is done, butt ugly ass maps and skins.
Sun Jin woo hitting different
Dragon??? Wheres Shang-chi at?
😧
Naaah, just make an Anime atp, I will watch it no matter the plot, the animation is so unreal….🤯
am gonna download the game again
This shits just fucking cool   Idek what's going on, but whatever it is looks really cool
Guess the adage is true, lawyers go hell.
How has nobody noticed the devil man crybaby reference at 1:13  It’s literally the same pose Akira does when he first transforms
PLEASE someone tell me that that's Charlie Cox voicing as Daredevil!!
Uh hol up, ps4??
Let me play with my friends in competitive again past gold rank please
Let the devil ooooouuuuuuutttt has to be an ult voiceline!!!
At 1:16 theres a hand on top of her head, im guessing thats how daredevil can see you through walls with his hearing
blind Lawyer btw
CRINGE
what is this dragon ball ahhhh fight, DID DAREDEVIL JUST GO SUPER SAIYAN 😭
BRAZIL AQUI ... Dá uma agonia ver isso e não acreditar q até agora a Disney não fez uma séria disso
They sure know how to make badass cut scenes.
se pá o melhor presente de aniversário que vou receber
Woah new blue lock episode!
Ps4 ?!
Make an anime for the love of god
1:15 ts one piece
Sorry what the **** is this glorious peak is this it insane
- "How dare you, devil!"  - "Say that again?"
CINEMA
One winged tank
So am I the only one who gonna be Lording DD on day 1 ? Because I’m beyond ecstatic that my guy DD is on the game
Daredevil just simply couldn’t see himself losing
Where xbox one?
I don't get DD being made this way. Isn't he a NYC vigilante?
1:25
I’ve seen people comment on how DareDevil’s powers are based on him being the guardian of the Eighth City and NOT him being possessed by the beast (the deity the hand worships), but when he busts his Ult not only does he get the same pink aura that the beast had but Angela literally has the HAND symbol over her head. It’d be insane to say there’s no correlation especially when the hand is a gang of ninjas and daredevil’s fit in this trailer is clearly inspired by Japanese culture. Also when he pops his ult the letters on his costume look eerily reminiscent of the letter on his costume when he was the leader of the hand. So safe to say I think this version of the character takes inspiration from BOTH storylines.
1:07 Not him smiling b4 letting the devil out!!!
Does no one else see it say coming to ps4 at the end, under the launch date...
Im not sure who made the daredevil animation but thats fire
Can see that the liberals on twitter are gonna call Angela gooner bait when her attire is literally the same as in the comics, just more muscular.
Wheres deadpool?
I’m excited to play as both! They definitely might be my new main
Will it be released for PS4? At the end it says it has
The devil doesn't kneel for ANY angels at all! Blind boi 😈🤘
DAREDEVIL
Daredevil going into rage mode looks insane, like what they've done with the art design
Daredevil is definitely going to be a duelist for sure
So why haven't your animators been hired to make a series yet?
0:53 bro hit her with the raging demon  nah i need to play this character.
make shogo a playable vanguard 😿
ALEKS LE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
what a disrespect for xbox one users
Is Murdock the villian of S4 with “The Beast” possessing him?
Cool angel and daredevil
God I love this game
daredevil is dare angel
daredevil IS NOT STREET LEVEL ANYMORE
They Be Letting anybody fight daredevil dawg
GIVE THE ANIMATORS SOME RESTT
THIS IS A WHOLE MOVIE
This is probably some daredevil 2099 action too.
I really liked the animation and the characters chosen but Why on ps4 Now ? It's just a question
Who tf is that, that aint daredevil from hells kitchen bro wth
Ngl, if daredevil had an ability where if you timed it perfectly you could dodge any move, that would be goated. If you don't time if perfectly then it would deal reduced dmg ig
THANK YOU FOR MAKING IT ON PS4!
I hope I hear "Sweet Christmas" in the Season 5 trailer
Rivals animation team is nuts 🔥
Daredevil cant do all that. Still sick though.
Can we bring back 6 and 4 stacks for competitive matchmaking? So many people are leaving because they can’t play with their friends and it’s a team oriented multiplayer hero shooter. Makes no sense to only have duo queue in upper ranks, also the comm bans are insane. You can’t use any curse words at all, season 0 and 1 were so good but now the games got 90% less players, clearly the changes aren’t all good
Finally, a TANK! And another....duelist...Seriously?
The Christian devil vs the norse angel.  Iconic.
The animators cooked
Alas, even the devil may cry
How is no one talking about the crazy animation?
What I like about this is that it isn’t really a battle between good and evil, just two opposing sides of justice. (Btw, Matt isn’t possessed by the beast, it’s a spirit known as dizang, the protector of kun Lun(that’s what I thought at first but no, dizang is his new title, kinda like the iron fist)). Angela is someone who can be hotheaded and does not believe in second chances, and wants immediate justice for what hela has done in service of knull, but Matt want fair justice, giving hela another chance to atone for her sins against the chronoverse.
I think the voice actor for dare devil is jin woo from solo leveling english dub
I just know that ult better be better than Jean
Pleas tell me it comes for XBOX ONE too!
COMMING FOR PS4!!! YAY!
Dare devils screen has to be all black with little white outlines, u should see the world how DD does
These animators need to be studied, swear every season announcement video has been nothing less than cinema with any character they choose to add to the game.
Man, if you’re telling Matt Murdock of all people to “Surrender to the Hand of Heaven” and you’re not Jesus Christ, you’re just asking for the hands. This mf fights people he has NO business fighting for less
1 mil views but apparently no one plays the game
really hope they put out a good daredevil skin…
Hydrogen bomb be coughing baby type matchup
I need a animated series on marvel rivals now!
Let the devil out is peak ult line
Anyone else notice the hand symbol above Angela’s head at 1:14? Think that happen when marked by daredevils ult?
Did anyone else notice Daredevil did a Raging Demon on her its from Street fighter one of Akumas moves XD Die 1000 deaths! MESSATSU meaning eradication
Until now, Daredevil being empowered by a demonic dragon wasn't something I knew I wanted in Rivals
Ps4 ❤
Whats goin on with my lawyer dawg
Ok this is awesome
If they made it so daredevil worked off echo location that would be peak game design
Don't mind me, just casually pausing each frame of this to appreciate the animation. <3
Let's see if other Marvel-Characters like Drax the Destroyer, Falcon, Shang-Chi, Captain Marvel (Carol Danvers), Ms. Marvel, Hercules, Tigra, The Frankenstein Monster, Mystique, Marrina Smallwood will Appear in Marvel Rivals! Because I'm excited about Daredevil and Angela in Marvel Rivals Season 4.
Daredevil is the Real Judge Jury and Exicutioner
Why does he sound like sung jinwoo
ALEKS LE!!!!
Holy impact frames
why angela a man !?
revert loki back to season 1 loki
Judge: Ma’am, where is your council?   The council in question:
I just want to see a whole show in this style, gahhhhhhdamn.
Oh it's MAHVEL BABY we got Daredevil before we get him in Mahvel Tokon Fighting Souls
Making Daredevil, who is Catholic, into a demonic character is utter woke nonesense. 🤦‍♂️
"Mankind knew that they could not change society, so instead of reflecting on themselves, they blamed the beasts. Heaven or Hell."
The CC says I'll beat you, but I'm almost convinced he is saying a name. Lowkey hoping it's him calling out for whatever the f is possessing him, which then is him screaming to " Let the demon out ".  Ie. He has a codependent relationship with it letting us have magic amped daredevil
Death by snu snu
goosebumps at the animation
Poggers
Question is Daredevil possessed because I noticed that he smiled? 1:07
I've been waiting for a reason to get back into Rivals and my favourite hero being added is the best reasons to! Gonna main tf outra him!!! They're doing my boy justice
The animators cooked fr
I hope after this we get two or three supports asap. It’s so stale and the fact that 1/2 supports we’ve had SINCE LAUNCH is a brain off boring “healer” that is mainly left click lasers (made for dps players to do support) doesn’t brighten my mood.
Guys why did they add Diddy to marvel rivals cuz like hes like dd? yknow ? GE-
The power scaling is so off and I’m obsessed with it and love it
-Mom, can we get some bread? -No hon' there's bread from yesterday, is not that hard *Bread from the day before*- The devil does not kneel before false angels
The animation is good as usual 🔥🔥🔥
who animated this 😭
Angela says that Daredevil is "Dizang! Guardian of the Eighth City" so that means this Daredevil is not Matt Murdock. Then where is Matt Murdock? Is NetEase deliberately like the Iron Fist case Danny Rand was replaced by Lin Lei?
Oh am I going to be screaming YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY WITHOUT FEAR as I descend upon the backline with a holy grace
Dragodragon
1:34 did that shi just say ps4
Hey when the Android version?
THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT ON PS4 ❤.
They gotta stop with these no name characters they adding.
NetEase: "We have our 'Gladiator Tank' before Overwatch 2"
Local street tier faces one winged angel Stay tuned for more news at 11
So Matt is gonna be a Duelist, right? I know they said they wanted to add more of the other classes, they already confirmed Angela is a Vanguard, but I don't see how DD could be anything other than Duelist.
Wtf is gonna be in DDs kit? 1. Darkness. 2. Advanced darkness. 3. Ult: Helen Keller
Anime daredevil
PS4 IS COOKED
He’s a really good lawyer
oh boy more dps 🙄
I wonder if the hand symbol above angela that apapeared after 1:14 is only after daredevil used his ult or is it because he can detect her like Punisher's passive ability.
So you’re telling me instead of getting Ant-Man, Reptile, Ghost Rider or even DEADPOOL… we got “Angela”? Tbh… WHO THE HECK IS ANGELA!!??😂😔😂💀💀💀  With all due respect🥀
Ts was so tuff
Hello mommy, hello daddy~!
No one is thirsting… Congrats, guys!
“—WTH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?? YOU’re THROWINGG!!!  —Daredevil doesn’t play with his monitor on.”
iron fist is the camera man
BP and DD together  gonna make healers quit 😂
OK I GET IT, DAREDEVIL'S A GOOD LAWYER NOW SYFM
the devilman pose. ok
bravo mais buffez jeff pour samsung
I USED TO PRAY FOR TIMES LIKE THIS🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣
I see the animators didn’t get to see their family this month 😭😭🔥🔥
Great another dps insta lock
Why did this animation make me wanna read all of DD's comics now dawg ? 😭💔🥀
yo like, im gonna be too busy playing silksong
Just give me a female Loki skin already 😮‍💨 Also, some PvE content please
"you are not the only one without fear" 🔥🔥🔥🔥
MARVEL RIVALS ON PS4 I USED TO PRAY FOR TIMES LIKE THIS
which one is coming out first?
Imagine this is your lawyer and you're about to lose the case l, then just yells "LET THE DEVIL OUUUUTTTTTT!"
Absolute cinema
Ps4?😮
Daredevil feeling like batman ninja
Just when I thought i was out they pull me back in
I don't know why everybody thinks DD is going to be a DPS 😂 That boy look bulky as hell and remember y'all got two duelist last season, only fair we get our vanguards on this one 🔥
Top in 2025... ❤
ABSOLUTE CINEMA
“You roll a dice to see your faith  The devil always wins the game”
Can’t believe they put the get out sound in the background bro
Nah we got blind man with sticks before ghost rider but I like the muscle mommy
Can't wait to play it on my ps4
Why is daredevil fighting an Asgardian with real power ? He’d get his ass whopper irl
What is this muscle woman?
This season is gonna be LEGENDARY
Matt be running hands with ANYONE
Finally...
Absolutely EPIC
This is one of my favorite trailers of all time
Add gamemode queue, not slogging through Dom to get a convoy/convergence map anymore
So badass how a blind hero like DAREDEVIL is literally going toe to toe with an asgardian god like Angela
Zombie mode plzz.
0:40 somehow, watching this trailer, especially this part. Reminds me of the chp. 5 ending in Black Myth Wukong.
Alright, Daredevil gets me back next month
Damn marvel rivals are going anime mode
Guys look at the  hand Angela has over her hand after daredevil says "let the devil out!"  Could that be his ult
Finally DareDevil! Now my blind ass teammates have someone to relate too
Do I have to feel bad when the blind guy says "where's my heals".
“Who put dragon ball in my marvel rivals?”
THIS IS SICK
Esa es la voz de corazón sombrío?
1:05 Daredevil: Are you kidding me?! 💢 I'M BLIND😡❗
The only thing that would really make me quit marvel is if they added their own OC characters
0:52 this looks like it came from asuras wrath
Demolidor Vanguard PLEASE!
Angela?...nah, that's rhea ripley in armor
“The devil doesn’t kneel before false angels” — okay pack it up, Daredevil about to be my main along with Iron-Fist 😩😩😩
It finally coming to ps4❤🤩
and they say overwatch is better💔
In any other scenario, 2 dps in 1 season followed by a tank and ANOTHER dos in tge next would piss me off, but I'll make an exception for Daddy Matt... imma need a double support season after this tho
this is amazing !!! keep it up
Gotta let it out gotta let it out GOTTA LET IT OUT GOTTA LET IT OUT Man just triggered his inner devil
Is it me or does Daredevil sounds just like Endeavour from MHA
Peak
Double tank is good hope for it
I’m a layer in day  In night i’m Devil 👿 The Devil doesn’t kneel for false angels 🔥😌
What a terrible Daredevil design
So Daredevil is suddenly a demonic nine tail jinchuriki energy projecting superpowered individual? Devs are overreaching with these powersets, Daredevil is basically just a blind acrobat.
DAREDEVIL
IS THAT MY GLORIOUS KING ALEKS LE OR AM I TRIPPING???
I really wish they could add Angela's wifeyy Sera into the game too. And i noticed at 1:14 Angela has a sort of mark, maybe dare devils ult blinds enemies?
Catholic guilt comes to marvel rivals
The honour has been bestowed upon me to cast Heavens Judgement upon the demon spawn.  Oh my goodness Angela, what have you done to me 😂
I hope DD's base skin won't be the samurai suit but his regular suit
Finally DAREDEVIL!!!!
this video goes hard
Us, born again
0:25 TRANS-WOMAN?
They have no reason to make Daredevil this fucking cool 😭🙏
Is that black myth? 😂
We've seen some saucey trailers but my god, this might take the cake. This is the sauce.
Why do I got feeling that ironfist is going to be very important in this season
More of these animations!!!!
Angela is Brolys sister
Broooo Twitter and Steam forum will get very mad if they see Angela.
美术已经炫技炫得不知天地为何物了
LET THE SHOWERS OUUUUUUT 🗣️🗣️🗣️
Bro,this is a anime movie not an trailer bro 😭🙏💀🔥
You're not slick I can hear your voice Alex le.
This game needs a story mode so bad. Or atleast a show on Disney+/Netflix like Arcane! PVE would be fantastic on this. We need to dive into the story in a fun way because it looks amazing.
0:58 God of war PTSD
Street tier btw
Is Daredevil's VA the same as MKX Scorpion???
Junker Queen wannabe... Wish the game was as good as the animations
SAMURAI DAREDEVIL??????????
Your Honor, I contest St Peter's latest judgment And the jailing of Fenrir !
Matt Murdock having the best radar for hot women, as usual.
Wow, Daredevil really got a power up to go toe to toe with Angela.
So no supports another DPS!! We get it Luna is a marvel rivals Ai music artist that get a stream every ult (that’s why it’s 12 seconds long) but cmon bro
Can't wait to play as DareDevil. Wolverine him are my top 2 Marvel characters.
THIS IS AWESOME
One question could do it so that Marvel rivals can be Played with low end Laptop because i own one low end laptop and i would Like to enjoy Marvel rivals on my low end Laptop it would be very helpful and i know that there are other players with low end laptop or pc who would Like to enjoy Marvel rivals so please i am on my Knees please let it playable on low end devices
Angie. 😻
My lawyer going band4band with a false angel.😮‍💨
So fire! Best reveal trailer so far... they better have Daredevils TV show outfits on day 1, I want his black durag outfit! 🤣🤣 I have a feeling a lot of matches are going to get tanked with streamers trying to play with the monitor off to get that real experience, lol. Oh boy, I can't wait... based on this, his Ult looks like everyone will be blinded in a range since Angela was marked with the "HANDS" symbol above her. I'll love it if everyone is blinded by him... great reverse uno effect, we'll see.
Why is Angela buffer than standard she hulk?  She's the assassin of asgard, not the roid rager of asgard.
1:09 LET THE DEVIL OUT 🔥
So unbelievably peak 😢
courtrooms hate when i use this simple trick:
Daredevil is such a chad.
Who's daredevil voice actor? He sounds cool
Full on anime style cinematics, with even impact frames. So cool
They better give daredevil his damn theme from his shows either one works but I prefer the Netflix series one 😭🥀🫵 ADD IT TO HIS MVP COME ON
Jesus Christ this has to be one of the best animated short fights I’ve seen. My God
another 2 months of the same strategists, oh joy
MFs Went Plus Ultra with Those Animations
MAKE AN ANIME MOVIE ANYTHING WITH YHIS ARTSTYLE PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ABSOLUTE FREAKIN CINEMA
Finally
Is that a comic daredevil? I ain’t remember him having powers like that?
La tigre e il dragone il versione superhero
Breaking news  This just in our local blind lawyer is duking it out with a self claim “Asgardian Goddess”, more information only on channel 15.
THAT IS NOT THE DAREDEVIL I KNOW
W TRAILER❤
When is cross progression being implemented?
Yall don’t know how long I’ve been waiting for Matt mf murdock
I used to pray for times like these
Hope angela is a tank
Wait, what?! Ps4? 1:35
No way, she's so sick. I love that they made her like this.
Who voices daredevil?
Look at my lawyer dawg, i'm not going to jail
Boooooo. More characters no one asked for. Numbers will continue to drop
Who hurt bro?
Absolut Cinema, just watched it again on a big screen.
Is it just me or are the maps bleak and not like as cool as how the characters look
Daredevil vs Malenia will go crazy
Daredevil wishlist: passive that allows him to see through walls , maybe make him able to spot low health enemies anywhere on the map and be able to track their sent, Grapple hook movement ability, billy club main attacks with the ability to throw one to ricochet off walls and  stun enemies. a survival ability for him to go into a boxing stance, and he dodges every attack for a couple of seconds. His playstyle should be about tracking and picking off low health enemies that are in a bad position . no idea if in the comics matt has ever used ninja weapons but a smoke bomb would be a good way to round off kit. Have him isolate his targets, smoke bomb to blind+ obstruct vision in order to force 1v1s. Will also help him get out of fights. It also pretty sick that he blinds his enemies but can still see them.
Who even is Angela? I have no idea but she looks cool & has 8-pack abs.
I want to know the names of the people who have worked on this. AMAZING
I can't be the only one who sees Asura's Wrath in the animation direction
Damn you hear a heart beating at the end 🔥
HOLLY CRAP!!
i didnt know dd move like that bro
I guess we know what 2 characters are coming out next
Damn this makes me so howrnery
1:12 Devilman crybaby REFERENCE
Angela : "And who are you?"  Matthew : "Just a really good lawyer"
Imagine we don't see the map like usual instead of a black background and sounds for people
MR is losing players fast. I get it to add AI bots to matches although I don't like it but hiding this fact by obfuscating player names is not helping you cause at all and making the game in casual extremely frustrating and annoying. Like I want to enjoy the game but it's becoming increasingly difficult
So I kinda found out DD’s ultimate, at 1:14 you can see Angela having a mark on her head like a hand 🤚. I guess Dizang creates a Blind Domain and marks his enemies
I love how the flying character has a land animal behind them and the walking character has a flying animal
This game makes 0 since I swear!! Their just straight up putting random heroes in the most random themes. Example....the city gets invaded by vampires who do you call....Fantastic four😑. Keep in mind we got blade in the knull season which doesnt match at all but moving on. When I saw these dragons the first thing came to my head was either "Shang-chi or IronFist" but what did we get!? FUCKING DAREDEVIL. I SWEAR THEY PUT MORE EFFORT INTO THE JIGGLE PHYSICS WITH THE FEMALE CHARACTERS BUTT, CHEST, AND THIGHS THAN THEY DO WITH THE STORYLINE!!!.
She's HUGE
Is that Aleks Le?
how tf does dare devil have godly abilities isnt he just a blind batman like detective roaming around in nyc ?
İt is look like anime fight but I love it
NAHHH LOOK AT MY LAWYER DAWG!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
SO PEAK!!!!!
I remember that episode of What If when Hela was taken in by Jiayi leading to her redemption arc. Maybe something similar will happen here after Dizang/DD takes her in.
Guys, it's finally coming to PS4 🔥🔥   I prayed for times like this❤
Peep the Tag on Angela’s head after he ulted. Bros gonna make everyone else blind 🤦🏻‍♂️
Angela definitely has been going to the gym, I don't remember her being this buff in the comics XD
It’s a shame this games ass cause this is so sick.
ABSOLUTE CINEMA!!!
daredevil NEVER did this tho😭🙏
We need movie
What in the Asura Wrath am I seeing, this is HYPE asf
Daredevil got a power up.
PS4?
Please have more evil villains in the game especially women!
Too bad you won’t fix your matchmaking. Could have been a fun game.
When spawn comes out
Yooo why is daredevil so amped giving my boy God powers😂🔥
WOW
This daredevil looks like from the same universe of psylocke 🤔
1mil views in less than a day, idk how can this old  game still popular
Like Devil vs Angel lol
MAPPA is looking very excited with these results, protect your animators
SnuSnu Angela 😢
This game has a problem with cheap characters. there are too many duelist. We need more tanks and healers. See you in season 5
MY PS4 NEW TROPHY PLATINIUM ❤
stop aura farming blud
another season without a new support 😔 ultron from s2 dont count
Parabéns neatcase por mais uma temporada de dlç de rivais e a Valquíria está maravilhosa demais nota 10/10 que nem a recente temporada da ema frost vcs são incríveis nesse jogaço meu din din pra vcs depois de 1 ano de sucesso e minha 1 escrição no canal
Just noticed that Daredevil dodges without looking which makes sense because he's blind still cool tho
Naaaaaah this easily their best trailer.
I loveee female vanguards i cant eait for angela but the possesed version of daredevil really suits him and it looks like his clubs extend to become chains which will be sick
Death by snu snu
We need Magik buffs 😭
Holy sht
bro what the hell is this animation, looks fucking insane
Did we just get a flying tank and another dps?
the Nezha skin gonna go CRAAAAAZY
Goosebumps.
Fog Hill of Fire Elements ahh coreo fight
Can we get a legendary magneto skin this season?
Another season of bad costumes it seems
Angels and Devils only Pave the way for the Ghost Rider
Wish Rob zombie daredevil played in the background
Is that a… is that a.. a yokai?
The very idea of Daredevil being able to so much as scratch Angela is hilarious.  Girl cleared the entirety of Hel, *practically* solo.
yayy
Not a fan of DD, but that video was EPIC!!!!!!!!!! So excited for these two!
To be fair, I was hoping for Green Goblin, be it mutant or Armor form but this... This takes the cake!
THE RED DRAGON IS DEADPOOL 1:29
lets fucking go
Right hand of God vs the Fallen child of Odin
When I was in high school, my father passed away - after this, I developed an addiction to video games.   It got to the point I would stay up all night until daybreak playing competitive video games, and this went on for several years  Strange thing happened though: in my 20's, I became a follower of Jesus Christ after praying to God and asking if Jesus is really His Son and died on the cross for me, and if angels and demons and all that is real  Long story short, He showed and proved to me it's all real  Not reaching out to judge anyone... like I said I used to enjoy these things very much  But now I found freedom from that, joy in life rather than addiction, and surprisingly now I'm one of those people who I used to think are such weirdos: going around and telling people about Jesus haha  Inviting you to pray and ask God the same thing I did and give it a try - what do you have to lose?  -------  For anyone interested in how God proved these things to me, here is more info about experiencing His Almighty power:  After coming to Christ, I got water baptized and began to tell people about Jesus on the streets with other believers.  On several occasions, the Lord used me and other Christians I know to do supernatural things - just like it says in scripture:  -praying for people to be healed in Jesus' Name and they were supernaturally healed: injured legs to where a person couldn't walk right, sicknesses and headaches went away, etc.  -praying for people and demons manifest, sometimes speaking an evil otherworldly language, and the devils come out of the person in the name of Jesus Christ, just how it's described happening in the Bible  -believers in Christ being able to speak with a supernatural heavenly language that is not of earth (speaking in new tongues)  -also, there were times when people came to attack me when I was preaching on the street alone, and I prayed for God's protection - in one instance, an aggressive person got supernaturally pushed a good distance away when they got near me, and in another instance the angry person approaching me seemed to get 'stuck' at a certain point where something invisible was blocking them, and they couldn't approach any further  Mark 16:17-18  17 these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;  18 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.
Imagine if one of Daredevil's abilities is just a massive smoke of blindness debuff.
Not feeling them constantly boosting satan and representations of satan. They just keep pushing the envelope.  Closer and closer.. smh
Thank God Battlefield 6 is a thing now.
All this just to get folded by squirrel girl 💔
Cyclops when
Nice to see Angela smiling for a couple of frames in the end. Girl is enjoying every single moment of the smoke
Someone can make a better comparison: but the Angel character somewhat reminds me of Blasphemous and something else.
Not a single person asked for Angela. All the characters they had to with with... 😂
Matt forgetting he street tier 😭✌️🥀
00:25 is CONAN THE BARBARIAN? SHAO-KAHN?
Daredevil will never not be my main Now I am complete..
All the more reason to quit playing imo. We need more Tanks and Strategists. I understand Angela is meant to be a tank, but Daredevil is obviously going to be another dos. They have said several times they are listening to community feedback and yet still just more and more dps.  Most people hate playing Strategist and Tank because they're boring and bland at this point, yet we have over double the options of dps when combining tank and strategist. Here we are though adding MORE dps characters to the game. Edit before people get upset there's a reason 90% of the player base dropped the game after season 1, the bad balancing and the over saturation of dps.
I would sell my soul to Mephisto to get quick silver in the game
Close enough welcome back Morgana and Kayle
I love the implication of Odin's first child throwing hands with a blind Lawyer
All care into the cinematic and no care into the matchmaking
Hey Daredevil, you're 0-7, can you switch?  "The devil doesn't kneel..."
It would be cool if dare devils ult made the screen almost pitch black for everyone including him and that little brand over Angela was all he could see but the enemy could see his glowing parts I think it’s a cool idea but that would be hard to execute without it being unfair
Marvel rivals finally added placement matches goodbye 50% of garbage EOMM warriors
LFG! So stoked to finally be able to play as Daredevil!
My ps4 gonna experience the maximum pulse
Gotta love impact frames.
Marvel Rivals, stop cooking challenge IMPOSSIBLE
Hell yeah! Time to let the Devil out! 😈
Mommy
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Okay okay....both of these are SICK. But PLEASE, we are in the Kun Lun season, I NEED Danny the brick shithouse Rand.
Impact frames in the trailer is crazy 😂
Now I know who I'll be looking for on r34
Two words I can say……ABSOLUTE CINEMA
finally a real muscle mommy character, hell to the yeah
A flying angel tank? and dare devil is a tank as well ?
Uh, guys? Angela’s from Spawn.
Yes finally Dare Devil, he’s gotta be one of my favorite superhero’s.
Does anyone know what daredevil was saying when he screamed
Daredevil: I reather kneel before my Lord and Savior name Jesus Christ.
I need to see a black flash edit of this 0:52
PS4 will explode during this game
My guy Matt already aura farming even in the trailer
Be careful of the Murdock boys. They got the devil in them.”
What are they feeding the Lawyers in NYC? 🙏😭
I think I found my new main.
I want to ask anyone, please tell me this valkyrie is a character of MARVEL and not a new creation of netease.
The game isn’t perfect, but the art style and animation is THE ONE thing that never disappoints me!
"But isn't Daredevil a street tier hero"  The streets of kun'lun ain't cheap
Why is Daredevil fighting a Spawn character 😂.
0:37 I just noticed that daredevils radar sense was visualized here.
I hope when you play as dare devil you your screen goes black and everything is outlined with red when they make noise or something like that
This whole fight is like Kayle vs Morgana from League of Legends. Even their color schemes are similar
ANGELA!!! LETS GO LESBIANS LETS GO!
THICKKKKKKKKK
hell yeah
Super cool skin, but GOD I hope it’s not his default
Is that a ps4 logo I see there? 💀💀💀
Let the devil out is such a banger line. I’m hoping that’s his ult line
Hi, I have a question. I hope someone can answer. I arrived about a month ago in Season 3, and I'm reading that with the Deluxe Pass, I can unlock rewards from previous seasons. Is that true? Can I access Seasons 1 and 2 and unlock things even though I arrived in Season 3?
nah u didnt cook. Not at all🤯🤯🤯
This is definitely the most hype trailer so far!
last season it was thor's mother and now its his sister
1:30 Netflix intro heartbeat
Lets hear it for the third DPS in a row! Cant wait for 56 DPS, 6 Healers and 7 tanks in a few months. 😂
This game is so great, always impressing me and making me grab my wallet bc I can’t resist.
bro is going to have some sort of smoke screen ult where he and his team can see through it and the enemy is just forced to reposition or get owned
I'm ready for muscle mommy
Devil of Hells kitchen
FINALLY we got a flying Tank, I actually thought War Machine would’ve been the first, but we can still get him later on.
1:09 BEST BELIEVE I WILL BE SCREAMING THIS AT THE TOP OF MY LUNGS WHEN THIS COMES OUT.
mommy vanguard 😍
1:09 BEST BELIEVE I WILL BE SCREAMING THIS AT THE TOP OF MY LUNGS WHEN THIS COMES OUT.
Are the artists at Netease allowed to ever go home? Banger after banger
Question for the nerdier nerds then myself, is that one of Hela’s crows or something else. Genuinely curious….
Daredevil's shout sounds like Scorpion from MK9 and MKXL. Thats so cool
Was that Angela from spawn ? Cause same weapon and look
Daredevil went from blind street level vigilante hero to god level jinchuriki super ninja in this season.
GIVE ME A 40K CROSSOVER I’M FUCKING BEGGING YOU
I honestly hope he is a Vanguard, he looks like he is going to have a boxing dodge and counter. “The best cure for a black eye is fast hands.” His ult looks will blind everyone in a radius and mark them with the symbol for The Hand and it will change his weapon into whips to hit multiple people. I am hoping he has some kind of swing mechanic like Venom and he looks like his whole kit revolves around evading. I am hoping when he throws his batons they bounce off solid objects and do echo location to reveal enemies.
Feel like Daredevil not only looks cool AF, it would have been cool if we got Charlie Cox, but also he only needed to say "The devil doesn't kneel"
WTF did I just watch? Daredevil is now a dragon?
Absolute cinema
Kingpin after seeing Daredevil summon the mystic power of a dragon and go toe to toe with an asgardian: “Hehe, I’m in danger!”
I can already imagine myself playing Daredevil with a black screen and only using sound to guide me.
I can't understand why is Marvel rivals in ps4 but not in xbox one
Ufff . Que animación 💪
Angela is one of my favorite characters from the comics. I've always been bummed that people didn't know about her, especially when she could've been in the MCU in Thor 3. So enjoy Rivals fans, you won't be disappointed!
this is soo good bro the devil is here daming
1:16 look above her a hand I think that’s dare devils status effect like spider tracer
LET'S GOOOOOOOO
so that what angela looks like.
who voices daredevil??
See all you one trick cry babies on the 12th  have you shid together Lock in 4 consecutive GM season’s I’m going for celestial season 4
Can I just say? Hell yeah, dude.
Okay so go play as the devil I must become the devil and tweak out
1:10 YOOOOOOOOO LETS GOOOO!!!! 🔥 why does it feel like I’m watching DragonBall Z right now?‼️
Someone tell daredevil he’s a street teir hero
0:53  Bro   1:12  *Bro*  1:24 *BRO*  I thought Daredevil was street tier lol. Since when could he do all that and fight angels and have dragon spirit stand things with him?!  I didn’t thing he had magic or real powers, just good hearing 😅😂
Wait so does he mark people cause I saw a hand on to of her head
Is... is Daredevil playing heel in this?!
Daredevil will fight a literal deity, win, then say "Where's Fisk?"
atp, Guangguang can we have a Rivals donghua 🫴🏾😭?
“I am melenia blade of miquella and I have not know defeat” 😂😂
Idk why but I feel like this Daredevil might have the literal devil inside (or the dragon heart thing)
When I see any support wearing a Swimsuit skin Imma: 1:10
I hear you Aleks Le
Yo these are two of my favorite most dope characters
Where are the supports?
Can’t wait to not log in and never play this game again. 👏🏼
BRO I WANTED TO WATCH THE WHOLE FIGHT WTF
Marvel Rivals cured my Overwatch infection. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.
1:14 Is that Daredevil's ultimate? Does he blind enemies? I can see some kind of 'hand mark' on Angela's face
I need ghost rider with these fire graphics
Such a waste of great design to do absolutely nothing and be nothing more than yet another platform for skins. Seriously it's sad that how much people are fine with this being all that's done with these characters, pvp vs game.
DareDevil's remark after throwing hands with Asgardian god, Team "How did you just do that?" DD  "I'm a really good lawyer.""
I need a show
Is this Aleks Lee???
Holy-
Ngl I stopped playing this when the first season ended due to me going back to elden ring. Should I come back?
it's peak.
Bro,release this game on mobile please 🙏
Bro, daredevil always be picking those up hill battles.
:)
Is this Daredevil even Matt Murdock or is it another Daredevil?
Absolute Cinema🙌
Doesn’t matter bring back group ques in comp
We Anime?😂
Bro who gave Daredevil the power to fight God's, give that person not only a raise but a CEO position too🔥
" _Dad, why was my sister named Rose?_ " " _Because your Mother loved roses Son._ " " _Thanks Dad._ " " _No problem _*_Season 4: The Heart of the Dragon Official Trailer | Clashes unfold Sept 12, 2025 | Marvel Rivals._* "
Are they really gonna add marvel rivals too the ps4?
Who the girl
Who's daredevils voice actor. Cause that sounds a lot like Aleks Le
is this daredevil possibly from psylockes universe bc he seems like he has powers and his design looks samurai-like
Giving Wukong vs Nazha vibes.
Why's everything in this game Asian themed.
absolute cinema ✋😐🤚
I literally thought it was Fortnite until I saw rivals 💀💀💀 yooo it looks crazy good tho
Thx you
How is a blind dude fighting a literal angel? Well, he’s a pretty good lawyer.
Im maining daredevil so quick, I can't wait till people get over the hump of the new character so I can just instalock him every game
Nah they didn't need to cook like that 🫨
After previous trailers i would say "meh" about this one.
Now that's a billion dollar animation
Great just what the game needed another DPS
They’re bringing Angela in!? Nice! Now we just need a Spawn cameo.
Thought for sure the next season will be taking us to Limbo or another place in Scarlet Witch's Choronverse, so us going to the Heart of Heaven is a surprise. Can't wait to play as Daredevil.
This gives me god of war vibez
Good work awesome job
Both better be tanks
“I’m daredevil not even god can stop that now.”
my god, this animation is fantastic..... give us more!
Deam
Get you a downtown lawyer that'd go supersaiyan for you.
Anyone else notice when Daredevil lets the Devil out. Angela has a hand with eye icon above her head! Does that mean Daredevil can track people with his ult? Or it's a passive?
Daredevil with supernatural/cosmic powers!? Kingpin better start hiding.
ANGELA MUSCLE MOMMY LETS GOOOO
Anyone catch that red hand over her head when he did that last move I bet that has something to do with his kit like he blinds everyone and can see the hands or something
The same day demon slayer movie hit theaters 😂
Ok and I thought they were staying away from a Tank Team UP, Hopefully she's decent looking to get some Thor playtime in  this season.
I do like how he used the word "false." I'd have been a bit annoyed if they stripped Matt's entire value structure which was heavily based in his Catholic beliefs.
1:12 Angela has a icon above her head after dare devil tweaks out?
You not a real DD fan unless you play wit tha TV off and sound from yo headset only 😊
Oh, that chick Todd Mcfarlene had to literally give up to marvel legally.  That's gotta hurt of he sees this.
The daredevil design looks kinda trash tbh, hope they put a version of the skin more related to the og
For a "street tier hero" Matt sure does fight a lot of definitely not street level beings
Imagine you were birthed to Odin, your brother is Thor, and you were raised in Heaven by warrior Angels... And your toughest fight is with a blind lawyer who's good at martial arts
Just make a marvel rivals show at this point 😭🤞🥀
tank/dps i guess. id be shocked if dd ended up as a support.
Uggggghh yeeeees Daredevil has been my number one most wanted hero since launch, brb gotta change my pants.
TREMENDO
True OGs know about Angela and a certain hellspawn...
Dare devil calling Angela a false angel when she was raised in heaven & he's a man dressed up in a devil themed costume not gonna lie cracked me up           All things aside both look great cant wait
They should make a cinematic universe outta this…
Is that Aleks Le voicing Daredevil? It kinda sounds like him.
I want Hulk 2008 suit
NetEase please make this an anime🙏
Besides the Japanese stuff everything looks great
It's about time my girl Angela is getting some much needed love outside of mobile games!!
"The Devil does not kneel before false angels" hits so hard and works on multiple levels
this season, we can go super sayian :0
I can't believe we actually got Angela, she looks crazy. Love it
goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
I hope the developers watch Blood of Zeus and then add all 12 Greek gods into the game
I finally can't wait to play this game on ps4
we got yellow washed daredevil
Oh. Its a character 90% of Marvel fans of the modern age wont know as the next character. Great.
MATT, PICK ANYONE ELSE DAWG
YES. YES. YES. YES. YES 🔥🔥🔥
As someone who aspires to be a lawyer, I think I may have finally found a duelist I vibe with
This is peak
DareDEVIL and ANGELa, I see what you did there Netease
We so need a strategist soon 😭
Hello Matthew
Why is this game so dope? I can't wait for Gambit, Cyclops, Deadpool, and The Juggernaut!
why does this game have to be sooooooo chinese???
Finally,  i can play DD in a black screen.
Angela and Daredevil is my Favorite character
DAREDEVIL IS HERE! LETS GO!! UNLEASHED THE MAN WITHOUT FEAR!
Hold is this the only time we seen rivial charters actually talk with their lips
YYESS ITS HAPPENING;!!!
Is Dare Devils VA also Sung Jin Woo?!
PS4🥀
IS THAT VALKYRIE ?
Can't chinese companies stop with forced cultural thing on IP that has nothing to do with it ?
1:00 daredevil be like "RAHHHHHH!!!! I WILL NOT LET YOU GENTRIFY MY HOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!" *goes devil trigger*
3 things.  1. Muscle mummy 2. Those impact frames  3. We might finally get a Danny Rand skin
Is that Patrick Steitz voicing Daredevil?? Hard to tell but when Daredevil screams "OUT!", it sounds just like Scorpion from Mortal Kombat.
Is daredevil gonna get a buff or something. How can he square up with an asgardian
"Anybody but cyclops" 😭🙏
Even a Devil May Cry
We need Bullseye to start a rivalry 🎯
Invisibility just got a nerf
Bro must be a really good lawyer
Are we sure he’s a street tier?
I’m hoping they’re not giving some type of powers to Daredevil, like it makes for a cool trailer but dude has no type of powers at all lol. And if the punisher works in this game there’s no reason to give other vigilantes/non powered people them too
Um why is this so good? 😂😂😂
Kayle, its you !?
I know a spiderverse animator when i see it
I’m glad they are back at adding Obscure characters  People gonna get angry at me for calling Angela obscure  But I really don’t know her other than that she wasn’t a marvel character but later on was bought by marvel so she could be canon in the marvel universe  And DAREDEVIL
Now we just need Luna to get nerfed to make this season a 10/10
If we have Angela, maybe there will be a collab with Spawn
Need to make a animated show
The fact Angela, a pick I never imagined is showing up is amazing.
Bros scream sounds like hanzo hasashi lol
Reminds me of the Diablo 3 cutscene when Diablo gets to the high heavens.
lets goooooooooooooooo
So who is the villain for this season
Not a blind man fight a baddie of a goddess
Can't they talk it over, like civilized folk?
guys i was so dissapointed when moon knight wasnt a dive DAREDEVIL LETS GOOOOOOO
WAIT IS HE VOICED MY CHARLIE COX!!! HE KINDA SOUNDS LIKE CHARLIE COX!!
Ok Now Kiss
we won
I didn't know Angela is ripped like that
🔥
“The devil doesn’t kneel to false Angels” translates to you’re my bih fym?😂😂
Breaking news local blind person goes to 1v1 a angel
I thought it’s gonna be charlie cox BUT GOD DAMN HIS VOICE 0:35
Pure cinema.
One of the my Best birthday gift if only I can get a any of this
NEW TANK + DAREDEVIL IS ODDDD 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Impact frames in a trailer is wild😭🔥
Their designs look sick af!   But i feel like there could have been a better title like "Angels and demons"
Yes, more vanguards!
I know a lot ppl are saying he’s a duelist but let’s remember: Marvel rivals released both Phoenix and Blade which we’re both duelists. IMO I do genuinely believe Both DD and Angela will both be Vanguards
who the hell is dIANG???
love the heartbeat at the end
Absgela going hard
You can't just drop one of the most GOD-TIER trailers on me at 3am like that bro!
I cant wait to look at a black screen when Daredevil comes out!!!
Glorious King DareDevil 😢
“You are not the only one without fear” 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥
MURDOCK DIDN'T HEAR NO BELL!!!
I absolutely hate The daredevil design
POV daredevil: black monitor
I SEE MUSCULAR WOMAN!!!!!
I WANT ELEKTRA!!! PLEASEEE
As a Vanguard main, its nice to see we will get help for awhile like when Emma came to the game
People who don’t know marvel like that - would probably think Daredevils a villain
I swear if it’s another 2 dps imma crash out
Angela is looking like she addes "a little bit of protein" to her diet.
ADD M.O.D.O.K TO THE GAME PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
aaaaa mi pichulaaaaa
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
1:14 "You are not the only one without fear!" Underrated line 😭
IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE ROGUE... ROGUE WAS SUPPOSE TO BE THE FLYING TANK 😭😭
Angela ‘spawns’ into Marvel Rivals.
We all love Daredevil and it was only a matter of time for him, but Angela?!  Now that’s an inspired choice.
Didn't realize Matt had a Devil trigger.
9 new characters added and only one isn’t white (excluding the clanker) Game and devs are a joke, not playing another boring season 🤡
Marvel is missing out making an animated series in this style
I know this wasn't intentional, but...  There are quite a few "One Piece" References in this Trailer  Angela is from Norse Mythology   Norse Mythology is tied to the current Storyline in the One Piece Universe   Angela is fighting Daredevil and wraps him up with what seem to be Cloth or Bandages  Covering Daredevil's Eyes with those bandages and with his Devil Horns pretty long, Daredevil looks EXACTLY like Loki from Elbaph 😊
1:14 From the looks of it, Daredevil's ult will blind enemy players
Let The EOMM Devil Out!
pls just give me deadpool
Heart of the Dragon but zero dragon.
Where is DEADPOOL bro
A MR animated series would be insane...
Daredevil was awesome, I like his Asian theme.
Dude daredevil has a dragon install this is nuts
Giving Daredevil the Batman version of "Normal man" I see.
Make a movie already please 🥺
When we getting deadpool
False angel or not, I want that angel either way
SINCE WHEN COULD DAREDEVIL DO THAT?!
Thors sister
Did foggy get life, red? - punisher
Can't wait to hear punisher and daredevil interaction lines!
The Devs are smart with promo lol they always show their actual kit  Daredevil will be a melee DPS, with a blink type dash, and a transformation ultimately Angela will be a tank that fires lancers and her ult locks the characters in an area down with chains things
One of the most raw lines and it’s in a marvel rivals trailer
Gracias mi Dios , llegará a ps4 , vamoooooos 🎉🎉😂
it's... it's so peak
The whole Chinese + Anime aesthetic rocks, please take my money
Nelson and murdock at it again
Holy peak. I need a show about this right now 😮
So cool
Can the game come to the Switch 2?
Sorry Daredevil, i'm on Team Angela here! The Angels shall rule!
Not very impressed by this daredevil depiction. Mot every character needs to be a god to be entertaining.
SUNG JIN WOO HIMSELF VOICING DAREDEVIL IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO                           PEAK
Thought daredevil was some blind ninja now he has a stand??😂
Since when can Daredevil summon a dragon?
Any spawn fans out there hyped for angela ??
LET THE DEVIL OUT
well well well, another dps character  colour me shocked
def gonna be playing him with a blindfold
I hope that's isn't the daredevil's main skin I preffer a classic style than a samurai one
I’m still waiting on Deadpool and gambit and cyclops
"Let the devil out" pure aura.
WTH is that green thing
DAREDEVIL!!!! MY GOAT!!!
Okay?
A marvel rivals anime will go tuff trust
Whoa
okay we need a show with this type of animation, because THIS IS NOTHING BUT STRAIGHT HEAT
"let the devil out'  Absolute cinema 🙌
They bring in my goat omg
Angela have turned into the One-Winged Angel
THE IMPACT FRAMES ✋😌🤚
Imagine all we see is black when we play DD
They really gave me steroids huh?
Whoever is hiring these animators needs to get Marvel to take them instead of whoever does the what if crap
“You aren’t the only one without fear” is such a cold line to say to daredevil 🥶🥶 fkn sick.
I wonder how Angela's interactions will be with her brothers Thor and Loki and her niece Hela
i wonder if they could get away with giving daredevil a kamen rider hibiki skin
dude the DD VA is going fucking nuts
"The devil doesn't kneel before false angels"  That is tough   Also if Angela isn't a tank I'm gonna crashout
“Blind lawyer throws hands with flying dude with wings” goes hard🗣️🔥
OK so her ult binds people and his blinds them
DD so badass i wanna learn to main him
Top 10 anime battles
is it me or daredevil looks like akira from devilman crybaby when he says let the devil out ?
I notice that a lot of pop culture lately has been obsessed with the Japanese theme of the dragon as the tiger (symbolic of yin and yang)
I need a Saul Goodman skin now
PS4 fans abt to call off atp
Super sick can’t wait to try them both
Me to my team in all seasons: are you blind guys?  Guess that one won't work anymore
And once again we arent getting the og superhero identity 😂
1:08 I love the attention to detail that she tried covering his eyes not knowing he’s blind
Wasn't Angela a character owned by Image Comics and fought against Spawn???
So where is Deadpool 😭
Y’all spit on the flag every time you nerf cap.
Mommy... I mean, mommy. I MEAN... mom-  *sighs and logs off Youtube.*
A white tear js ran down my leg🔥🔥
Wow just everything is just perfect to the amazing detail just perfect
Angela really from Spawn will Spawn be added in the future in the game as a guest character
if any of the marvel animation stuff is as good as this…
Why is it saying ps4 I have one yet it doesn't show up when I look on my ps4
It's about to be a party!
Is Daredevil fighting Helya or Valkyria?
Daredevil better be Spiderman 2.0 his move set should be mostly acrobatic and he should be difficult asf to hit
I'm praying that they any of them are dps characters. We need more tanks and supports not enough variety in those categories rn.
0:24 reminds me of the Imperius vs. Diablo battle from Diablo 3!
Everyone knows that after passing the bar exam, each new Lawyer have to punch the heart of Chiangtang in Kun Lun as part of the oath taking
I would had preffered Shang-Chi over Angela. To me she is way too overrated and meh. Shang-Chi would make way more sense for this season also to me. But that's just my opinion. Ok?
Finally! A female character with a different body shape than literally all the others!
😳
Daredevil as a dive tank would go stupid! Excited for this season!
1:13 I NEED THIS AS A WALLPAPER NOW
Dear god they made Angela a muscle mommy 😮
Holy animation divine
Whoever animates these NEEDS to make an animated series
I hope this is actually Daredevil and not just Dizang. We’ll see when we get gameplay and in game voice lines I guess  On the bright side I really like this justification for why the heroes are fighting and I like how Angela actually has the build of a warrior (it’s not uncommon for her to be pretty slim and lacking muscles in the comics
My friend who likes this showed this to me and man this goes so hard
My goat is chopped 💔
Please tell me Angela going to be Vanguard?
Holy
Nothing particularly to do with the video but I think every character in the game should have a completely comic suit style usually there  first appearance
My sister and I are screaming right now. We love Daredevil and Angela looks amazing! (She is such an underrated character!) They definitely cooked with the character models
Flying tank???🗿🗿
THE MAN WITHOUT FEAR
People’s PS4’s finna explode cause of this game
Finally Daredevil!)
0:48 raging demon?!
They are cooking a 5 star meal
Finally I can play as my favorite Lawyer in fiction.
MY BOYS!!!!! THE DAREDEVIL!!!!!!!
Glorious. Absolutely glorious. 👑
Okay so we've got Daredevil and... who's the other one?
Who is the one-winged angel?
What does a devil and an angel have to do with dragons? Nothing. Why do chinese companies work SO hard to insert Asian themes into their games every few months? Do American games force a cowboy theme several times a year? Do Nordic company games force Viking themes every few months? Just curious, do Chinese companies literally have a government mandate to do this? Because I see it in game after game whose over all theme has nothing really to do with chinese culture and feels in conflict with the world building in those games to the point of being immersion breaking.
Marvel Rivals is finally better than Overwatch, they now have Muscle Mommies as well
Main angela desde la beta
Angela looks Soooo good❤❤❤
It’s Matt right?
Daredevil bro what's this costume😭 pls add classic skins, not as different colours.
Where’s quicksilver.
More of these animations please??
0:44 Me realizing they remixed “rivals to the end”. It sounds so good too😭.
ANGELA!!!!!!!!!
2 seasons without a strategist being added
I need "Charlie Cox" voice !!!
LETS GO PS4 PLAYYERSSS
Who's bright idea was it to release a new update the day Borderlands 4 comes out... I mean really.
Let me remind y'all, this mf is a LAWYER
"The Devil doesn't kneel before false angels." Preach, king! PREACH! 😭
I am Angela, Blade of Heaven, and I have never known defeat XD
Imagine adding all 12 Olympian gods to the game and having them tank it al
Daredevil this, daredevil that. MOMMY ARFARFARFARFWOOFWOOF
Wonderful art. Genuine peak.
DARE DEVIL!!!!!
*Pull my Devil Trigger*
"well folks its about that time" summon him we must
Malenia??!
Why is Angela evil and attacking daredevil?
dont need more dps need more tanks
need two tanks
need two tanks
need two tanks
FIREEEEEEEEEE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Good now give nightcrawler
Y did she cover his eyes when he’s already blind
Omg im about buuust
That better be Matt Murdock and not some pretender.
who's the woman?
Bro is that the GOAT Aleks Le voicing Daredevil????
WE GOT JIJI AS DAREDEVIL OWIE!!!!!!
Bros deal with mephisto or what? how he keep up with angela
HOLY ABS. Literally.
A vanguard and a duelist...
If there’s no spawn references this becomes the worst update
Why daredevil sound like sun Jin woo
Coooool
Oh shoot, Daredevil? First character to not be a part of that initial leak. Wonder if any plans had to be changed
I don’t pay that much attention to marvel but I love rivals, who is the girl I see people saying she is from Asgard is she like a vakyrie
BRO IS FADING WITH ANYONE BUT STRERT LVL OPPONEN (DD is street lvl)
That’s not Deadpool
People not realizing the description of the video says that's iron fist and NOT actually daredevil...
Cant wait to play as Angela love how her voice echos and daredevil looks cool
Dang so we bout to get a flying vanguard for the first time in Marvel Rivals history
I'd pay money to watch a Marvel movie/series with this animation/art style. That Daredevil scream 1:10 is so GOATED 🔥
I CAN FINIALLY PLAY THE GAME IM ON PS4
Who is that woman?
Sheesh with the way Angela’s looking, if I was daredevil I’d regret being blind
this is awesome, but FR next season 2 STRATEGISTS PLS
Matt Murdock is just too angry to lose to a literal angel.   Also what a genius match up, ANGELA and THE DEVIL OF HELL’S KITCHEN.
*LET THE DAWG OUT!*
This is legitimately art. This trailer is absolutely GORGEOUS. The animation and effects are beyond anything I think I've seen yet. This is literally Spiderverse quality. Maybe even better! ❤❤❤ Amazing job devs.   I didn't think I could possibly be anymore in LOVE with this game and yet somehow you got me hooked even more ❤❤❤   This season looks outstanding!!
Oh, a new season for Marvel Rivals, WAIT ITS COMING FOR PS4????
Call me delusional but... They look like their BOTH tanks
Why is Marvel rivals animation keep getting better and better🤯
Omg PS4!!!! i can finally play the game now
DAREDEVIL!!!!! YESSS!!! THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR!!!
An asgardian having beef with a blind lawyer will never not be funny af.
No Cajun? 🥺
A angel of heaven....vs the lawyer.
If only the What-If show looked like this...
Bro indeed A Man Without Fear
This appears to be some powerful variant of DD because holy hell. He looks way more devilish compared to the blind man we know
GREEN GOBLIN COULDVE BEEN THE FLYING TANK AND YALL FUMBLED. STOP PICKING WEIRD CHARACTERS. DAREDEVIL IS BORING. USE CHARACTERS EVERYBODY KNOW AND WILL BE EXCITED FOR INSTEAD OF TRYING TO MILK EVERY SEASON
Angela is so damn lucky that she isn't fighting Daredevil in a hallway.
Looks like Hand-cursed/Beast controlled DD tbh
Yo he said let the devil out
1. Glad that talented little pot sticker who made the animation for the fight between Hela and Blade is getting more work and GLORIOUS PEOPLES REPUBLIC BETTER GIVE HIM GLORIOUS ANIMATION STUDIO TO MAKE HIS OWN ANIME  2. damn Angela been eating hgh like Thor's been chugging mead bruh
Daredevil vs Professor X bouta go crazy in the future
The man without fear is here!!!!
OMG DAREDEVIL!!!
i say you vault ironman and add Hulkbuster as a flying tank...
What do you mean daredevil scrapping with god ??? 😂
Our first flying tank is a muscle mommy, Dardevil is here in sick fashion, and we got a cool potential ult line. Can’t wait to see this season cook!
It's giving more duelists in a game already saturated with duelists. Thanks, I guess.
ON PS4 FINNALY😭😭😭😭🙌🙌🙌
Dizang?
Who else thinks Marvel Rivals should get a TV Show! 🙋‍♂️
Finally more vanguards
I did not see this coming
Daredevil 10👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Angela -10👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
I can watch this over and over
Finally
I’VE ONLY HEARD ABOUT THAT GIRL IN MARVEL SNAP! AND THIS OTHER DIMENSIONAL DARE DEVIL LOOKS *EPIC* !!!! THIS NEXT SEASON IS GINNA BE HYPE!!!🤩🤩🤯🤩🤩🤯🤩🤯🤩🤩😊🤩😁🤩😁🤩🤯😁😁😁😁
Looks like Angela still out here hunting Hellspawn like she never left Image...
Daredevil is cool and all, love he’s here, I just didn’t expect it to be Chinese
A FLYING VANGUARD OMG FINALLY
I can’t wait for the instalocks on daredevil
Okay do I speak for everyone when I say I want an animated show/movie about this game with this animation?
He the righteous hand of God, He is the Devil that you forgot.
0:35 - 0:41 I love the hidden detail of DD's echolocation and enhanced senses projecting
Have yall considered making an anime?
epic
💜Jesus loves you all so much he died on the cross for our sins and rose from the dead three days later turn to him if you want but know that he’ll always be waiting for you 💜
All become Wushu in the end.
The aura this blind lawyer has is absolutely insane
Why are your teasers so F-ing Flashy?   It becomes uncomfortable to watch them. Also they look cheap and make you seem a bit "desperate for attention".
Lowkey is there any animated series with this good animation and artstyle 😅😅
On ps4 ???????????????   Thanks
Imagine DDevil effect make the view look different but all sound is amplified
The chef cooked🔥🔥🔥
thats my lawyer right there
LESSGOOO DAREDEVILL 🔥🔥🔥🔥♥️♥️
will the screen be black when playing as daredevil?
I have never played marvel rivals before but as soon as daredevil drops I'm not playing any other game
And once again we get a dps and possiable a tank. Sigh, Happy for new tank but dps not so much Reed, torch, blade, phoenix now daredevil. We got 5 dps these past season 3 tanks now and 2 supports cool yay
What in the anime trailer
You can't call the season Heart of the Dragon and not give Iron Fist the legendary jumpsuit!! Or even a Fei Long skin!!
Well seems I'll be returning to funny website again for Angela.
Nice another flying character
Why is she swole
RIP overwatch
This version of dd must of gotten powers because there's no way that's just the animators being dramatic 😭   I ain't complaining though 🫱🏽‍🫲🏾
NETEASE, MAKE VENOM A DRAGON SKIN AND MY LIFE IS YOURS
ANGELA IS A TANK!!!!!!!!
BREAKING NEWS ‼️📸🤳:   New York’s local lawyer , Matt Murdock, Co. of Murdock And Nelson Law firm, seen beating the devil out of a false Angel. More at 6
I wonder will they add she-hulk or rogue someday?
1:22  Daredevil never did ts 😭🙏
The man without fear is coming 🙌
Mid af
So they're using a version of daredevil with like more powerful powers? I only know Netflix daredevil so it may be some comic version I'm unaware of.
Angela tho😫🥵🥵🥵🥵
We found something tougher than a hellspawn... a lawyer
zasshu
Well marvels lost players its just a game for dps at this point
Let's gooo it's on ps4
Bros popping his Devil Trigger
Animation & artwork team...amazing work!...applause applause applause
Daredevil Chino
Omg omg ahhhhhhhhh ahhh ahhhhhhhh oh yeah 👍🏾!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😊❤
malenia big sister
I wanna know what was hela's crow doing 1:19
I love DD but no way I am gonna play him when I KNOW he gonna be insta locked every match
En efecto es cine 🗿
Excited but more DPS?!
Punisher's got competition now
Hyped
i cannot believe they added saul goodman to marvel rivals before quicksilver
Que m3rda. Estragaram mais uma vez um personagem "básico" e urbano. Pareceu um episódio de Saint Seya
Look at my lawyer dawg, im going to Helheim 😭
Why add Angela when u could’ve added so many better characters, like apocalypse, doom, exodus, sentry, etc… also still no cross progression so what’s the point
MY GOAT
Still waiting for cyclops
Beyblade got some competition and they ain’t spinning
fire
Oh great more DPS how boring
I wonder if this Daredevil is under the influence of The Beast. I’d assumed this would be like the white suit Hand of God daredevil, given divine power, but the “let the devil out” when he activates his ult and darkness of his power up seem to imply it’s something malicious.
Angela looks like a tank, please be a tank, and Daredevil looks like ANOTHER dps, please be a support somehow. Thanks for more DPS Netease. It's cool that you still don't get it.
I'm so happy that we got Daredevil and Angela
All the Angela naysayers begging for MOMMY'S FORGIVENESS
Can’t wait to play DareDevil and have it just be a black screen the entire time
let the devil out
What a strange way to introduce Daredevil. Losing faith in this game.
Why does the game hate facial hair? Daredevil should have stubble
If only Marvel or DC just made a whole movie like this........man
Wtfff this was actually real
Hopefully a Tank and a DPS. Sigh more DPS...
I hope they add Odin down the line and bullseye
A lawyer fighting an Angel.. 😂
I'm maining that tank
SFM animators getting ahold of the Angela model. 😏
Una completa locura de Tráiler!!!!!
new main. him and wolverine will be the only dps i play
-Sigh- Guess I better start making more 'Heroes we want' videos.
Hopefully this creates new Spawn readers
Why does daredevils voice sound like Alex Lee the voice of Jin woo from solo leveling
Angela: Shall I give you dis spear
Brooooooo 💀💀💀 HOW THE HELL IS THR ANIM BETTER THAN LAST SEASON'S TRAILER??? THE SMOKED IT NOT COOKED 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
''ill beat you '' is reference to the show when he screams at kingpin '' I BEAT YOU ''
I take it the context is Angela hunting Hela who now resides in the Eighth City to atone for her actions after the Knull fiasco, and Daredevil (Dizang) is fending her off to give Hela a chance.
Level up lifting
🤯🤩🤤
At least one of them isn’t a DPS I think
Angela's muscle mommy
Thanks to Daredevil, we got 2 characters with Double Ds on their chest for S4
I love this yin and yang.  The Devil who’s a Catholic The Angel who’s Queen of Hel.
"You're not the only one without fear!" She's trying to tear down the catchphrase
Man Daredevil got an upgrade!
Daredevil my dog is back
A good vs a really good lawyer. I'm all for this
Kinda wish they gave Daredevil his classic suit instead but I can’t wait!
YOU SHALL KNOW THIS DEVIL'S POWER!
Matt still disrespecting other people religions and gods even though he's met MANY.
angela reminds me of golden cheese cookie
ps4 1:34 ??????
anyone else here you are not the only one without beer
Angela seems to be pretty muscular, I love muscle women, eh but that aside, hope she will be a tank then.
We’ve gotten blade, We’ve gotten daredevil. WE’VE GOTTEN SO MANY TEASES FOR ONE MAN THAT HASN’T BEEN RELEASED THOUGH. SO INSTEAD OF LETTING THE DEVIL OUT.. LET DEADPOOL OUT
So we got two more DPS M
A TANK FINALLY
0:25 GO ANGELA GO GO, GO ANGELA GO GO
Daredevil is gonna be a strategist
They gave us a fav tab to select heroes!? INSTA HARD PICK GONNA BE A BLAST!
corny af dialogue but the angel woman looks really cool. hopefully not another dps
1:34 That background looks beautiful 😍 ...I need it
They're cooking in Hells Kitchen
Alternate version   daredevil: the devil does not kneel to false angles  Angela: that's rich coming from the false devil
No more  DPS please
Whoever did this artwork for the trailer went crazy!!
again with the asian theme stuff, jesus.
WHO LET THEM COOK!!!!
Can you guys PLEASE make an animated series with this animation my god its insanely good
Oh boy another duelist
THA MAN WITHOUT FEAR IS COMING!!!
daredevillll sonunda umarm kör olur
Daredevil be moving in this trailer
Make a netflix animation already😮
Who is the other person who isn’t daredevil?
I dont play Rivals anymore but this might be one of the dopest intro trailers for a videogame season ever
Where is Polaris??? I see a trinket for her, but come on, lets get her in the game already!!
Will we be blind while playing dare devil???
Cry your heart out overwatch
Dizang (地藏) is the Chinese name for the East Asian Buddhist bodhisattva Kṣitigarbha, revered as the "Earth Treasury" or "Earth Womb". He is a compassionate savior of the dead, guiding them through the underworld bureaucracy and hell, and is often depicted as a Buddhist monk. Dizang is known for his vow to not achieve Buddhahood until all hells are emptied and all beings are saved
Yep, I'm officially a Daredevil One Trick
When superman?
IM ANGELA, BLADE OF ASGARD
So another 2 months of teams of all DPS
Is this Wanda in her dragon from at the end?
Holy peak
We love to goon another day!!!
Oh yeah, can't wait for this story in 4.0 👏
So this is what overwatch 3 is up to
FINALLY MY BOY DD IS HERE
How are we going to play dare devil if he’s blind
Hear me out….Daredevil (marvel rivals) isn’t mat murrdock but someone else who took up the mantle the same way iron fist isn’t Danny….This daredevil maybe part of the quin Lin group who was chosen to take the mantle and isn’t blind but able to use ninjutsu techniques and stealth similar in how daredevil fights..
wasnt that broad from Spawn?
oh my god, this is so hype, i hope she is a tank, she look like she has the frame for it, and a flying tank would be incredible
Daredevil looks so fresh!!!
✋😐🤚 peak
dibs
wait, who's the other character? im not much of a comic book reader
BUFF IRON FIST.
……. Another tank woman???…………………. I can hear the hoard now
Where Shang-Chi at?
Absolute Cinema
The art style and animation is beautiful man damn
The animation is so fucking peak
Tiger and Dragon both represent strength, honour, and courage, the diffirence between dragon and tiger is; "Dragons are wise, thoughtful and compassionate. They think before making a decision and try to understand before passing judgement. Tigers are the opposite, brash and courageous. They think with their spirit and rush headfirst into situations." i like the idea that Matt got the dragon and try to protect hela from uncontrolled punishment but Angela got the tiger and try to punish hela for what she done in Knull arc. Matt still a lawyer after all :)
Does anyone else notice the "PS4" logo at the end of the video?  Is that true?
I shed a white tear to this
daredevil is him
Peak rivals strikes again
what did they do to my daredevil
Daredevil wow only gambit iceman cyclops can get me this hype
Amen
Angela my beloved she is going to work with the guardians again lets goooo!
Art style looks like asuras wrath
I don’t think they know what the devil in dare devil actually means
Daredevil!! I’m assuming he’s gonna be a black panther playstyle
This the same street tier dare devil we all know? Also Angela is jacked.
Not even joking Overwatch production have never made something this good
Angela is in the game. Does that mean we can have spawn?
Bro I'm just so glad I can play as Daredevil which is one of my favourite marvel character of all-time. He's barely feature in any big Marvel game.
The man who created angela made her for his daughter because their wasn’t enough women heroes at the time I hope she sees this animation and is proud to see how far Angela has come
Are we sure that’s not just a new iron fist skin
man he really is like a dragon
I’m make my screen pitch black to play lore accurate date devil
THANK YOU MARVEL RIVALS!¡
They hit DD with the Chinese ray 😂
El pan de ayer:
“So the devil is back”
OMG
Eh close enough, welcome back Malenia.
All the leaks were right 😭🙏
1:13 Devilman Crybaby energy
Well I know PS4 people are happy now I wonder how they going to work out
I know DD.....who is she? 0_o
Efectivamente, es cine!!! 🗿🗿🗿
From the looks of it, this specific version of DD isn't Matt, maybe it's someone else wearing the Mantle of Daredevil, or maybe someone just possessed DD.
Instalocking daredevil every game
1:18 dies devil have helas powers??
NETEASE!!!!!  PUT THIS GAME ON SWITCH 2 AND MY LIFE IS YOURS  I DON'T CARE HOW GRAPHICALLY UNDERWHELMING IT WILL BE
"street tier btw"
Bro the impact frames are so locked in this is the most fire season release I’ve seen in a while
Damnnnn might have to get back into this
Daredevil -"LET THE DEVIL OUT!"
No healer??? Bad season.
Despite their gooner reputation, Marvel Rivals players in the comments here remain really calm and reasonable after witnessing the (literally)godly muscle mommy. I respect that
"The Devil doesn't kneel before false angels" 🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥
them stars aligning boi
"I've been thinking about this day since I was 12 years old."
Unfortunate for the literally god that she's in a hallway
Still no doom huh?😂 these have got to be the most random additions yet lol
Insert Malenia reference here
As hype as I am for this I hope that the daredevil skin is not his default ngl
DAREDEVIIIIIIIILLLLLLLL ❤❤❤❤❤
She look big so she will be tank for sure
We want Daredevil first !
Team Cherry dropped the Radiance off at NetEases door before Silksong came out
Im still waiting for Ghost Rider
No te pases qué bueno en Play 4 genial pensé que jamás lo iban a sacar para Play 4 wow
Its peak... its PEEEEEAAAK 😭
I don’t think y’all realize the Matt is not a lawyer rn
ANOTHER DPS CHARACTER WOO YEAH
We gonna tell our grandkids about Daredevil vs Iron Fist from this season
Immortal, Superhuman Bounty Hunter with the Powers of Heaven Vs Lawyer literally too angry to die
Wow new season? Still haven't played since the end of S0 but game is looking good! Were getting daredevil and a muscle mommy? I've never seen her before in Marvel surprised we didn't get she-hulk yet but bless Rivals for the diversity. Amazing trailer for the season, animators go hard.
We getting Buff Mommy Flying Tank and Dragon Spirit Blind Lawyer, which do I get excited for? I cant pick!
Is daredevil voice actor same as Jiren from dragon ball ?
Bible accurate daredevil 😂
Still no cyclops
Is this the version of Daredevil that is possessed by the beast of the hand?
He sounds like Jinwoo
Tuff ult voicelines
I swear that's the Solo Leveling english VA for Daredevil
What in the marvel holy war is happening?!?!
Man they onde exactly what they are doin with angela's design
angela is the most ripped person ive ever seen in my life😳
PS4👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽
Now I will play Marvel rivals! Let's go matt!
Hold up guys daredevil is lowk built like a tank we might be getting tank daredevil
Naraka 2?
Daredevil should be a hardcore dive counter. BP, spider, magik, should be useless against him. He should also be anti stun and immovable like Thing
I hope Iron Fist gets some love in this season. This is literally his home. I need Iron Fist to have some type of role.
Great... looking like MORE DPS IN THIS GAME! IF 3.5 didn't already prove that everyone insta locks Dps already enough as it is. Yea let's get 2 more Dps into the Game.  She better be a Tank. Not much sense for Devil to be a Tank.
MY TEAMMATE IS ACTUALLY BLIND
Daredevil with actual powers is gonna be an adjustment
This Devil will indeed… *Not Cry*
Best trailer 🎉
The impact frames😮
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
Ganbito pls ???
As a half gooner I’m maining Angela cause of how damn cool she looks
Y’all put Malenia in the game and she’s fighting The Devil of Hell’s Kitchen… oh yeah y’all are COOKING 🔥🔥🔥
i hope Daredevil gonna have a passive ability where he would be able to like see the Characters that can go Invisible, that would be Dope and also Scary like Imagine you run away from the Whole Team and hide and go Invisible, and whole them just pass by you, and tgen there comes Daredevil and he slowly turn towards you and writes in the Chat "I See You" brother i would try to do anything to just survive
OH MY GOD ANGELA WANTS HELA THEYRE FIGHTING FOR HELA
TS LOOKS CRAZY
Please we need a marvel rivals tv show with this animation style and high level of polish
Wow just imagine if the matchmaking was half decent
i js realized why this game is called rivals
We dont care, solve matchmaking and then add characters
wuuuuuuuut
Emma and Iron Fist got competition
Wtf
another tank and dps character! yippie!
Flying comp is so back
FORGET DARDEVIL! THIS MOMMA!!!
IS THIS AN ANIME I AM NEVER LEAVING THIS GAME
HELLO ???!!!!!
Why are they not making a show with this animation
Flight reacts gif
Devil vs dragon
OH MY FUCKING GOD ITS DAREDEVIL
DAREDEVIL LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Why does Angela looking like she is taking steroids. I not sure I like that
crazy if you think im playing this over borderlands 4
Animation team needs a raise fr
Surprised more people aren't mentioning this, but does this mean we're about to get a true flying tank? Wonder how that works if so
Angela flatten me 😫🥴
Holy crap
Angela she looka lika man
They are having a aura battle
When you get to heaven and its Chinese
He seems like a really good lawyer
Daredevil looks perfect, Angela on the other hand looks like she’s been hitting the gym too much.
Daredevils design is uh, certainly a choice
Bro so much work in these trailers . I'm already so hyped. The team puts their hearts in them ngl😆🤩
Angela better be a Vanguard, Daredevil oooooooh I could kinda see him as a Strategist but DPS makes sense.  I hope we get Luke cage or Power Man (Victor Alvarez (Vanguard) and Jewel/Jessica Jones.   I don't see us getting Hellcat maybe Daimon Hellstrom he'd be an awesome healer
Hopefully they drop an MCU or comic style skin
Wait ps4???
The animation looks good, but I'm reeeaaaally not a fan of that Angela design- like, daredevil looks alright, what the hell happened while they were designing her?
wtf
so fucking badass
Honestly after seeing this, please give me a show with this animation, those impact frames were so hard.
I’m officially becoming a Daredevil main
Not gonna lie that daredevil design sucks ahh
Ladies and gentlemen, The ORIGINAL Daredevil.
Anyone see the ps4 Playstation Logo or is just me? 😮
Rivals has rly started to go hard on the impact frames
Holy fricken aura 😮😮😮😁😁😁
Angela : "Don't you dare devil!"
Nobody Lord with both yet? Casuals.
When's cross progression?
1:08 holy that smile is terrifyingly awesome
who is this wwe girls for real, what is the point of releasing 1 hype character and an unknown hero intentionnaly MR ???
New donnie mommy! death by snu snu!
Can someone tell me the name of that angel girl??
Ps4 ppl cried so hard so forced the devs to make the game for that outdated console
Cross progression when?
Finally more Angela love.
My wifes bday...Im gonna be late tho.
Flying tank?
Step on me ✌️
"The Devil doesn't kneel before false angels." Baller line.
We got Angela from the Dark Horse in Marvel Rivals? GIVE US SPAWN!!!
MORE DPS JUST WHAT EVERY TEAM GAME NEEDS YAYYYY
is the angel lady Valkyrie or someone else?
Holy moly, the animation!
Peak
dam this looked like a League of Legends cinematics .
We need carnage
Is it me or does DD sound like Sung Jinwoo?
She's a tank and also those muscles
Ts so peak tho
"I wish Daredevil was in this game" *The monkey's paw curls*  "Granted, but it's not Matt Murdock."
this might be my favorite trailer yet
FINALLY BABY DAREDEVIL
ASURA WARTH !!!!!
And I love the music playing in the background while they fight almost gives you the shang chi final fight vibes or maybe it is just me 😂
LETS GOOOO
So no Charlie?
Ngl, I'm not feeling the suit design for Daredevil at all.   And wth did they do to Angela? She looks nothing like she should.
No nightcrawler still,…okay net ease
Bro let gooooooooooo
God I hope they buff Iron fist since this is relevant to him.
tank and dps?
The malenia ptsd 😳💀
Damn it still no Deadpool
Not me coping hoping they’ll both be vanguards
Weak move. Out of the whole Marvel universe, they pick the lamest characters? Fans would go crazy—and they’d make way more money—if they added Gambit and other heavy hitters instead.
HOLY MUSCLE MOMMY SHE LOOKS SO GOOD better than her OG design ngl
Can’t wait for the LET ME TELL YA SOMETHIN RED
Please let us get the Phoenix Feathers/Force Nameplate Frames in Season 3.5, just as you have allowed us to get both the skin Emerald Flames and Emerald Blade. Thank you.
I can definitely see daredevil ultimate blinding the whole team. No pun intended, kinda like Cloak and Dagger
DOPE
Are they both tanks
Cool, another DPS, we needed it.
Hmmm… I wonder what Angela’s lore in this is? since Hela already exists as Loki and Thor’s sister, you’d think they’d retcon Angela, but no, here she is in all of her ablicious glory.
Cool trailer but if they’re both DPS, I’m going to cry
It be hilarious if we got a Venom skin that closely would resemble Spawn so then technically you can have Spawn vs Angela in a Marvel game 😂.
WHAT ARE THEY FEEDING THESE ANIMATORS
Angela i saw coming, Daredevil i did not
Ong not another duelist
PS4!!🎉🎉🎉
Please let her be tank bruh I need a new tank.
I love gow Daredevil is dodgi lng without facing the attacks. Doesn’t need to look at them. Cool detail and awesome moves.
Foggy gonna be jealous of Matt for this 🔥
Wait who is the bad guy this season?
"Switch off dd your 1 and 5 bro" GOD KNOWS I WANT TO, BUT YOU DONT GET TO DESTROY WHO I AM!
I really hope they add the black suit from daredevil season 3 as a skin
Rivals the Animated series would go crazy🫡🫡🫡🔥🔥🔥🔥
They got Angela lookin like Angelo🤨
Cómo van a hacer para que corra en Ps4???
Damn, On a Streak I am, I knew Angela was going to be the next but daredevil, how does he fit?
Finally Daredevil 😈
More melee chars no thanks game already sucks for healers as it is
Trailer is 🔥! They gotta add his born again fit too. And give him a team up with punisher
FINALLY
Rivals animations always look crisp bro like look at these impact frames
MA BOY DAREDEVIL WOOOOOOOOOOO
He's a really good lawyer.
yes please
They really want me to play tanks with one hand
*Surprised Deadpool Face*
DAREDEVILLLLLLLLL
bro daredevil coming to he game i might start playind dps if he is one
IM MAINING MY BOY MATT
Not an exact copy, but she looks like my main character of a series I'm writing.
LOOK AT THOSE MUSCLES!!! Best Angela ever, I'm even more excited now 😍
Now I can finally play as my favorite marvel character ANGELA
impact frames on daredevil is aura.
When Cross Progressions?!
0:22 DEATH BY SNU SNU!
MY GOAT DAREDEVIL NO WAY!
1:33 it drops on my birthday
His ultimate.. “WHO TURNED OFF THE LIIIGHHTTSSSSS”
How is daredevil able to match blows with an angelic god?    he's a REALLY good lawyer
You guys are going to run this theme to the ground huh.
As a Jeff main looks like im bout to be a devil main.
YOOOOOO!!!!!!! VALKYRIE AND DAREDEVIL!!!!!
Just one episode of one piece in this style of animation… Jesus that would be epic.
I AM MY SCARS
Is that Matt Murdock's Daredevil?
Time to fight with my friends on who keeps which character
OH MY GOD HI ANGELA OMG HOW ARE YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Angela has come a long way from a C-list Spawn character.
Dardevilllll
So who’s the bad guy? It’s looking like the devil
Daredevil vs Angela is something I never thought I’d see…. But LETS GO WE GOT DAREDEVIL
Angela is probably the first female design I don't like as much, but Daredevil looks absolutely INSANE! Cool trailer!
Home Run Neatease 👏👏👏
how we gonna play as a blind man 😂
0:28 "DEATH!.......by Snu Snu!!"
DADDDYYYYY DAREDEVILLLLLLLLLL
Looks great!
Why does Angela have One Wing? Does she have a Sephiroth skin that we can purchase?
Season themed around Iron fist too, classic skin incoming?
This trailer is amazing!
Yippee another duelist
So we all gonna ignore that ps4 logo 😭😭 they gonna be playing at 30fps 💀
Death by Snusnu
This is genuinely one of the best trailers for a game I've seen in a long time. This trailer was freaking AWESOME 🔥🔥🔥
Yo when we getting Cyclops?!
“The devil doesn’t kneel before false lawyers” said by a really good blind lawyer
HOLY COOK WHAT ARE THEY FEEDING THE ANIMATORS!?!?!?!??!?
1:12 this has got to be a devil man crybaby reference and if so, goated.
They made her into muscle mommy lord have mercy
Channelling Castlevania
just amazing.....
TAKE MY MONNNNEEYYYYYY!!!!
Just kiss already
Overwatch is alive and healthy
Where is my goat Deadpool
When is Ultron gonna get a new skin?
Peak 🔥
Daredevils va sounds a lot like Sung Jin-woo from solo leveling? Pretty great choice if so.
why tf does he have superpowers?
C est incroyable
Can't wait for Daredevil, finally a 22nd duelist is exactly what we needed 🙃
Since when did the mcu have hawkgirl?
What in the dragon ball z
WHAT FKIN ANIME AM I WATCHING????
wow...amazing...just spectacular...
not even a marvel movie gets me this hype, that looks dope
Let the devil out is my new favorite after saying I didn't care if Daredevil got put in marvels. Mind changed
The game doesn't need another dps rn
Yayaya!
Daredevils voice actor is peak 🔥
PLEASE GIVE MY PENI PARKER A SLIGHT REWORK ON HER ULTIMATE!!
Hoping DD is a strategist and not another DPS.......................
Holy peak!
pls add deadpool
Am I the only one who knows Angela is connected to Spawn?
So they turn angela into a tank and this is her look.
0:36 the devil never cries
Whatever they payed these animators, it wasnt enough
Sooo can we get a support instead?
For immersion purposes, gauge your eyes out for the best daredevil experience 👍🏻.
Better be vanguard and strategist this game has enough duelist !
Never knew I needed marvel impact frames until right now. They keep cooking with this game
What do they feed the animators
Dommy Mommy
Oh SNAP! Angela!
Must I play Season 1-3?
Please God give us Angela First
Bring thanos with infinity stones please
1:05 hopefully his ult voices sounds like this if not…im not playing they already ruined blade..
another duelist? yay..........................
I wonder if Daredevil will actually play very different than his comic book versions with actual super power speed judging from this trailer. He is probably powered up by someone or something
Daredevil looking like a speedster of Asian decent…. With a dragon spirit? As long as he’s fun/viable who cares  but just saying…. if this happened in the books pretty sure DD readers would boycott. Lol
He doesn't look like Daredevil to me! Might have overcooked here!
I wonder if Matt ultimate ability would be like that cloak and dagger terror cape ability where the whole enemy team would get blinded for a certain time limit
Revert the party size restrictions! Then I’ll come back
Daredevil ❤
ABSOLUTE CINEMA ✋️✋️
Cant wait
MARVEL MAKE A SHOW OFF RIVALS ITS RIGHT THERE ON THE TABLE😭🥀
Ps4?!?!
Can't wait for all dps characters....
I was hoping for ghost rider :(
Great still no Deadpool but we get a blind lawyer...trash
Yet another DPS coming . . . yaaaay 😐
Pov definition of peak
wow its amazing to more duelist
I hope Angela's in-game model won't be so massive (but do keep her ripped as goddess) kinda losing the huntress vibe here
POCKET SAND GO
That DESIGN for Angela....  M O T H E R.
To all those who said his name was Dizang and that he’s not Daredevil. I’d just like to say I called it!😁
So sick Murdock finally made it in the game!!
This is not a street level Daredevil. This is a fantastical Daredevil.
The Angel lady sounds like she’s voiced by the same actress who did Rhea from Fire Emblem 3 Houses.
Please add more dps characters we sure don’t have enough thank you marvel rival devs
The idea of Daredevil fighting a literal Angel is hilarious, considering him being Christian is like... a huge part of his gimmick
Brooo what..?!!! 😮
0:23 Yes please
ANGELA THE TRUCK
That was sick.
Naraka bladepoint vibes
I'M BEYOND EXCITED AAAAAAAA
insano
Daredevil left NYC for Beijing?
They got Alex le?!
So either she's a vanguard and he's a strategist, or we'll have had none of one or both classes for two seasons in a row. That sucks man.
Is he dps???
lol I can’t wait!
i love Dare Devil's design it looks awesome
These trailers are animated so well, the style is great. SO Sick!
Need more DPS please. The lack of DPS is depressing.
I think i just ca…
PS4?
Looks like an alternate version of daredevil
god dd looks so cool😭😭 better have some good voice lines with spidey. if spidey doesnt have a quip about dd being blind when i get an elim on him ima be pissed
Now please
THEY MADE HER A MUSCLE MOMMY VANGUARD LFG
At 1:14 you can see Angela has a symbol above her head. This kinda shows that daredevil’s ultimate is going to shroud their vision. But there might be more that I missed in that scene.
IS THAT ALEKS LEE MY GOAT?? All im ever gunna hear playing daredevil is lighter
That was dead ass a devilman crybaby reference when he started charging up broo
They took " Let em Coook" too seriously damn the animation, the Va going to be exciting for sureee
O si hermano
This is so heat, good heavens.
PLEASE make Angela a tank
we need a anime type show like this in the mcu asap this is just crazy 🔥
Wow Angela got BUFF Those ABBS!   Great animation, looking forward to Daredevil.
Step on me Angela 🥺
I BEG, PLEASE... GIVE US ANPTHER GOONER LOKI SKIN. I WANT ONE FOR HALLOWEEN, HIM IN LEATHER AND CHAINS. PLEASE, I NEED HIM. I AM FERAL.
PS4..YESSSSS!
can anybody confirm, this means a new battlepass is coming Sept 12 right ?
Keep cooking rivals! 🫡
I need an explanation on why Daredevil is suddenly anime fast & super strong enough to fight Thor’s sister? Unless this is just a trailer presentation & nothing to do with the lord of the game.
Seeing Angela honestly made me want Spawn to make a sudden (probably will never happen) appearance
He’s a REALLY good lawyer.
plz let the girl be a tank. not enough tanks in the game and too much dps heros
ANGELA MY DARLING MY GOAT ASGARDIAN SISTER OF WAR, YOU LOOK PHENOMENAL!!!!!
Fun Fact: Angela, the Valkire, originally came from the Spawn Comics from Image.
Xbox one when?
Who are the actors who make the voices?
Daredevil about to be my new main😂
ANGELA LOOKS SICK
Damn what are they feeding this universe’s Daredevil that boy strong as hell 😭
ALSO CAN WE PLEASE PLEASE GET A SHOW. 🥺🙏🙏🙏
I somehow can feel another unjustify Spider-man nerf, don't treat your home boy like that, Deadlock will come out eventually and you don't wanna lose your most dedicated fanbase
Yo guys, i have decent aim in rivals but i am hard stuck plat. Any tips to rank up ?
So ult blinds enemies and leave a mark on them
Bring back 4 stacking in GM ranked
She said something about the 8th city in the beginning. Does this mean that in Rivals DareDevil is an Immortal Weapon?
babaderrimo
LET THE DEVIL…. AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Angela was always tall but damn she’s a monster in this. Makes sense for her to be a tank now. I wasn’t sure how I felt about it before. Spawn character in rivals baby ❤
I’ve solo tanked and healed long enough, you dps instalockers better learn to tank or heal cause ima be instalocking dps for the first time ever as DD and nothing is gonna make me change. (Unless he’s really hard)
OMG!! THIS IS SO GOOD! I cant wait for the next season ❤️❤️❤️ I really wanna play as Angela and DD. Especially Angela. I love her already!   This is awesome thank you for this 🥺
I am so fucking happy for Angela.
2 TANKS Lets goooooooooooooooooooooo
Like the characters, not rocking the theme.
Daredevil looks sick
What kinda super soldiers serum is Matt on to even be going toe to toe with a Demo Goddess. Trailers gas$$$$
Not cooking. Angela dogwalks DD on his best day lmfao. Yall need to actually KNOW the characters you're putting in the game ffs.
ABSOLUTE CINEMA
Cross play?
Is that Aleks Le?
Thor and Loki seeing their Sister visit over: 🥰 Moon Knight and Spider-Man seeing their lawyer visit over: “Who sued us this time?”
Wow Good next new iron fist 👏👏👏👏👏
So I read the description and it seems this isn't Matt Murdock but someone called Dizang? Or am I wrong?
The devil is the good one and an angel is the bad one... Am I watching the shonen version of hazbin hotel?
Cyclops fans in shambles rn (me)
Local legally blind lawyer on the same fight card as a biblical angel that is also Odin’s daughter
alright is it me, or is daredevil moving like that suspicious?? like ik he's acrobatic and shi, but to be moving LIKE THAT??? nahh he's gotta be possessed by the Beast cuz aint no way he'd have THAT much power
What did those animators smoke to produce something like that? Holy.
Please let the 2 be vanguards or strategists
OH MY GOD DAREDEVIL & ANGELA, They look incredible!! But DAMN THEY BEEFED UP ANGELA a megaton.
😱❤😱😰😨😱😨😰😱😰😱😨😰😱😨😭😰😨😱😰😭😨😭😨😭😨😭😰😭😨😭😰😨😭😭🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯   (Eu n sou um bot)
Dd costume is lowkey ass
I can already hear evanescene playing in the background
And my point stands on having a marvel rivals series the story is already there
ANGELA IS A VANGUARD!!! LET'S GOOOOOO~ 😭💗  Side note: The animation went so fucking hard. Their lips actually moved when they spoke. We are so back.
Angela! Give me that +2 for ever card played here waifu.  Daredevil got the SSS+ Gatcha treatment.
Damn this looks so damn elite! The developers really be cooking!
IT'S ANGELAAAAAAAAAAA🧡🧡🧡🧡
Oh yeah im gooning to this one
What in the Asuras Wrath is going on here
Yesssssss!!!!!!! We’re getting Daredevil in the game!!!!!!! He looks badass!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. I can’t wait to play as him.
1:00 Gooners be like: Yes MOMMY💀💀💀
Who is she?!
DAREDEVIL!!!!!!!!!!😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
...what?
Muscle Mommy
Now that Angela is in the game... When is Venom getting his (not)Spawn costume?
INSANEE
Closest we ever getting to having Spawn in the game
Meh, fix matchmaking and add role queue
Angela is a tall muscle lady!! Lets freakin GOOOOOOO
The best I've ever seen Dare Devil look.  Who the heck is the other female character? and Where is she from?? Iron Fist comics?
They both look *chef's kiss*. The Art style is so fucking good too. Would love them to do a full on animated short series around each hero.
Para cuando el polnito?
wow new dps wow omg
IS THAT MY GOAT ALEKS LE?????????????
Fun fact Angela originally came from spawn comics she was wayyy more powerful than her marvel counterpart but she still strong af regardless ❤💪😎
Hey devs, female vanguards doesn't need to be this beefy everytime 😢
AURA FARMING AT ITS PEAK IT FEELS LIKE A SOLO LEVELING FIGHT ITS SO GOOD
That's one damn  good lawyer.
The ps4 gonna explode fr bro
Who let Marvel rivals cook
se me paro
If we’re getting Angela we need SPAWN!!!!
so we got the ds movie releasing in the US the same day this season comes out. Holy peak
bro wtf is happening
I hope marvel makes a show with this beautiful animation style really soon
DAREDEVIL  let the devil out
When it comes to trailers, Rivals CLEARS Overwatch
Daredevil and punisher and spider man are going to be peak
Guys at 1:18 u can see a green wolf does that mean or tease something or is it an ability from the 2 new character? Please help me out
Nah bro this ain't it wtf
Para que esto sea mejor voy a a apagar mi tv cuando juegue como dardevil
Ps4!!!!!
Midtown for DareDevil Anyone? I wonder if Charlie Cox would be playing his character with his fans?
Marvels Rivals never stop cooking always DESIGN INSANE
The Devil 👿
WHY IS ANGELA BUILT LIKE THAT??? HOLY PEAK
HOLY PEAK
The animators and VA needs a raise
Well that escalated quickly
Peoples wishes for Daredevil to come to this game have been answered, also what beef is there between him and Angela?
Who's the chick?
Can't wait for Adam to res DD and give the tv show a shoutout
I feel like dare devil will be like iron fist
Can Daredevil actually do these things?
If I know Matt Murdock, Angela is gonna fall for him any minute now.
how he got a buff before he even dropped
WHO LET THEM COOK?????
Any chance he’s a strategist? 😂
know what this game is missing another dps like we need more dps characters why do we need healers or tanks this is dps rivals I hope we get 45 dps characters before there are 10 healers :)
Bro a flying tank is just what I needed! I hope she is.😭
Mommy- I mean Mommy- I mean Mommy...
Daredevil versus Angela is such a random choice
4 seasons while deadpool is finished in game already and we still dont have him at this point we never gonna get him i cant
Looks great but we need a support
Anyone else hear the heartbeat and a bit of Daredevil’s theme at the end??
Ain't no way they add another DPS hero right? RIGHT?
That doesn't feel like matt
Dear Marvel...A series in this animation style. Please, and thank you
PS4 Version in 2025 is crazy 😂
DD is another dps!?!?!
Wow....more dps.....yay.....Ill come back in a season or two. Jesus, we need support, and you drop more dps. We haven't had a good support since season 1 with Sue. Ultron is just a dps with a crap heal.
What's with Angela's build? That's a little too bulky for Angela, even for Marvel Rival's standards. She's not huge or very muscular in comics, just lean/toned looking in a few, but definitely never bulky.
welp , no healers this season again , but yeah flying tank is a great addition
Dawg we need cyclops
Still no Carnage 💔💔💔💔💔💔
She has to be a flying tank😭
DD dps ggs this game gona die. Remove stacking limit on ranked
1:16 MONEY SHOT
🟡😇LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😈🔴
PLEASE MAKE DARE DEVILS SCREEN LIKE THAT ONE SCP FROM SCP CONTAINMENT BREACH PLEASE 🙏
kingpin watching daredevil summon a freaking dragon being like "I think I'm gonna move from this city"
If daredevils passive ability isn’t that he can “see” invisible characters like invis woman, loki, psylocke, then I don’t want it.  Logically it would make sense with his hearing being like echo location.
Stay on 2k26 grinding badges or come back to rivals?  🤔
so freakinge cool
MY GOAT IS IN LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOO
This gotta be hand magic
oh momma.... 👀
sweet mother of God... Angela...
So… Angela had a wife in the comics. We got our first Lesbian rep in the game! When they said everyone is on the table they meant it!
How is Daredevil is able to fight an Asguardian? It's kinda lame giving street tier character too much powers.
Sups ??
So they are going to give daredevil those weird demon powers he and punisher had for some time?
pls both be tanks omg
How is he doing all dat
Bro WHO made this heat 🔥 🔥 🔥
Coughing baby vs hydrogen bomb
wait im just realizing the leitmotif of "Rivals 'til the end" is playing in the theme of the season music the whole time. wicked attention to detail
OMG Angela is our NEW MOMMY
Daredevil in the game = I will not play with any other character never again
Bro they cooked🫡
I wished for Cyclops on my birthday, not whoever Angela is    I guess I'll just humble with my boy Daredevil
ik who i’m maining this season
So is daredevil being powered up by Shou-Lao or the Beast?
You guys MUST turn this into a show. The animation style reminds me of "Arcane"! BEAUTIFUL!!! 😍
WTF?!!!!  This is man or woman?
If only they removed EOMM a lot of people would still play
Man, we need a Born Again 2025 suit for daredevil
Who is Angela?
Glad he’s powered by the hand otherwise he’d be full of swords😂
More DPS...  perfect
THEY COOKKIN
peak as always
I NEED HER AS A TANK!!
I love the crouching tiger and hidden dragon reference ❤
Yay... Duelists again... Bye bye.
0:54 isn’t this just the newest iron fist mvp?
Angela giving Tyrael from HotS
Pls deredevil tank a im need tank!!!!
Yup, *she's definitely a Tank.* And I'm calling it now, but I think Daredevil will have a rage meter or rage mode, hopefully more like Blade's E mode than what ever Wolverine has.
THEYRE BOTH TANKS
Who is he fighting
Knew that angela and Daredevil would show up specially since the person with hela in the last page look liked Daredevil and how hela would be judge by her family, so this would be about angela planning to deliver justice by killing hela and Daredevil would obviously would go against that
Man they butchered angela, yes shes a tank and she must be big but come on they are being lazy here, making just a BIG woman like that is just... i dont even want to say it but its just horrible, at least give her a bigger armor something more original, Emma was already pushing it and if every female is gonna look like this I hope this is the last one they make a tank, i`ll just wait for something that makes sense like she hulk or titania
Yay yay yay new so we can finally get off of magneto
Angela better have a line that's an offhand reference to Spawn.
Hope this season is gonna be good
THATS MY GOAT OMFG LETS GOOOOOO DAREDEVIL WE ARE SO BACK BOYS
0:44 dodge, AURA FARM,dodge then ORA,ORA,ORA,ORA,ORA
Please let this be a double Vanguard season
Sooooo, if Angela looks like a tank and daredevil obviously needs to be a DPS…. It’s going to be a long season for the supports🥀
If that was Warren Worthington III aka the high flying Angel (NOT LAME BLUE METAL ARCHANGEL) I would’ve been much more excited. Matt looks kind of cool.
Double D! I'm so happy!
So spawn is next right
do they know daredevil isnt actually a devil
DD Instalock raise hands!😽🤚 Until Deadpool 😚
Daredevil first please 😢
went from fighting AVTF to throwing hands with literal gods DD the goat
the devil doesn’t kneel before false angels 🚬🗿
WHAT IN THE ANIME HELL?!?!
JORDAN NEVA DID THAT MOVE😭
insane updates but please ii can't bare the eomm shyte also please make the comp 6 stack eligible and also please remove squirrel girl, iron man, wanda!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i don't like skilless people countering actual skilled doods.
Im afraid that We gonna get another 2 dps
I don't like Angela's design dare devil looks great though
Dare devil my new main has been unlocked
absolute cinema
Can't wait for futa angela contents🤤
Why does Marvel Rivals animation look way better than Marvel Studio's animation?
DEMON TIME
MY FAVORITE CHRACTER  ANGELA OMG !! i maybe gonna try hard this game again
No Deadpool? Boooooo!  Aside from that I am excited that Matt is making his entrance. I have no idea who the other chick is or what she is
Season 3.5 felt so short and I haven't played since emma frost came out
If its 2 more duelists im not playing this season
he's not street level hero
Angel V.S Devil!
Just to be sure this is a Chinese company in case no one recognizes it, the trailer plays on the theme "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"
Might as well introduce dbz
Did anyone else notice that red hand above her head after the transformation. Hopfuly it's called the red right hand !!  1:13
1:06 DUDE HE LOOKS LIKE A DEMON INFERNO FROM FIRE FORCE 🔥 SO COOL
We get ppl who are mid and yet no Richard Ryder or Sam from the nova corps, they literally worked with guardians of galaxy and Spiderman
Saw a leak of daredevil gameplay, but it was just a black screen...
I wonder if they'll do the red and yellow suit as a ranked reward
HOLY PEAK!!!
I love daredevil this is hype
PS4😮🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I’m all for daredevil being added, but please… not another dps… make him an evasion tank if you have to
WoW we really needed another dps 🎉. Thanks Dev for listening!!
LET THE DEVIL OOOOOUT  edit: is that a hand above angela? hand of god?
Ps4 😊❤
If daredevil doesn't always show a black screen when you play him, I'm uninstalling
Why they putting Malenia Blade of Miquella in Marvel Rivals?
Bro we need a nova character as well
NetEase PLEASE give us the King Daredevil suit
Patrick Seitz as Daredevil? Did I hear the voice right?
No xbox one?
I'm back
Next should be ghost rider ant man some xmen than we can focus on villains
I will not stop picking DareDevil till I have lord on him.
Kayle ULT
man this villain called matchmaking is tough. they havent fixed/defeated it in 4 seasons
If this isn't the season that adds role queue, I have a feeling the player count will die off even further. Good luck, I guess
Nerf Black Panther already!!! I’m to the point I’m quitting matches if I see the character because he’s so OP.
Fire 🤌🏾
They have Daredevil soloing Malenia here.
WE NEED NOVA!!
I guess a fade is an omniversal event.
This is so sick! We need Nova next!!
The fact Rivals is coming to PS4 is... Worrisome? Not a fan of needing to ensure the game runs on 12 year old hardware...
Zzz😴
we need a support character and nerf Luna plz
NERF LUNA ULT AND ADD ROLE QUE PLEASE!!!! GAME IS DYING!
i wanted cap marvel to be the flying tank but ok i guess i will take this.
Does no one see that it says PS4??
and yet, no heals
MAKE AN ANIME ALREADY.
They really went nuts with the animation this time god DAYUM
yall are still clowns for the matchmaking and yall know that 🤡🤡🤡🤡
Interesting approach they went with Daredevil... he looks like he has some kind of Chinese aesthetic (and possibly chi empowered). Not surprising though, with the whole fractured timelines thing... I mean the version of Psylocke in the game is an oni/yokai hunter from fuedal Japan, so anything is possible.
Let's gooooo Dare Devil's gonna be SO SICK!
you play as Daredevil your just blind
Fix your matchmaking
Nah i want an animated series at this point. Production quality for these cinematic are way too good
How is this game gonna run on someone’s PS4 from 2013?  Can’t wait for that instalock DPS PS4 player running at 30FPS to throw my games.
big props to editors and visual artists, fantastic job
Bro is just a blind lawyer. it’s not that deep
DD ain't never do that before😂
There may be only 9 supports, but sure let’s add another dps.  That’ll fix it.
Am I the only one who saw it saying PS4 at the end?
Why is ps4 in the thumbnail
And still another day without Dr. Doom
Damn the devs made Emma the THICC Thigh Queen and now Angela the Muscle Mami. Bless the fact that tanks have to have big hit boxes 😂
Muscle mommy Angela???
"NO! GOD KNOWS I WANT TO, BUT YOU DON'T GET TO DESTROY WHO I AM! YOU WILL GO BACK TO PRISON! AND YOU WILL SPEND THE REST OF YOUR MISERABLE LIFE IN A CAGE! KNOWING YOU'LL NEVER HAVE VANESSA! THAT THIS CITY REJECTED YOU, IT BEAT YOU! I! BEAT YOU!" - Matthew Murdock  Words cannot express my joy. Daredevil is my favorite comic character period, and seeing him added  brings me so much happiness lol!
The impact frames>>>>
I’m sorry but did they get ALEKS FUCKING LE TO VOCIE DAREDEVIL!? That’s actually so sick
Who the f is Dizang?
Virgin marvel rivals fans: “please netease, no more vaguely East Asian aesthetic choices in the art and skin design”  Chad netease: *coughs in yokai*
Daredevil?? ❤❤❤❤
She better be a tank……
I mean cool ahhh trailer ngl
Gonna be tough to see anything as Daredevil
ps4 confirmed at the end of the trailer
Another dps….
The heart beat sound at the end is a nice touch, idk if its usually apart of trailers, but it suits daredevil
FIRE🔥🔥🔥
Dps...
Why is no one talking about the PS4 logo at the end?
Can we agree that hawkeye and daredevil are like the wolverines from the vigilantes of marvel? They always end in a situation facing sum bullshet
Please Angela be a tank 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
1:12 PS4 users when someone pops an ult 😂
okay this is just anime now.good.
Marvel just remembered they spent a whole arc bringing Angela over from Spawn before just absolutely forgetting about her existence.
She blindfolded a blind man 🤣
1:12 I miss the rage
ABSOLUTE DRAGONS 👐🐉
daredevil looks so sweet
Who’s against daredevil
Peak ❤
Is this matt? Or some other dude as DD as a comic variant?
When is the dev vision
the poor souls who are gonna be running this on their ps4 are gonna be the new eomm agents
No way
Beautiful ♥
Let the devil outt
It cannot be this serious that we’re popping bankai 😭😭
Oh nice another DPS 🫩
Daredevil and a random character, but at least she looks like she is going to be a vanguard wich is good, also the devs coocked with the cinematic.
Marvel Rivals been going crazy with the impact frames lately
Omg this is so fire!!!! Angela and Daredevil look amazing!!!! 😭😭😭 Also with Angela looking so buff she's definitely gonna be a tank thank god omg!!!!! 😭😭😭😭
HELL YEAAAAAH
Nahhhhhh daredevil in the game.. im bout to become so insufferable
How can you fight a God?  DD: I’m a good Lawyer
absolute cinema
Who is the big muscle mommy??
“You are not the only one without fear!” is the hardest line I’ve heard in a while
Can't wait to go 0/14 with Daredevil 😊
Che juego muerto  Aquí podemos pelear vegeta kskdja
Ts so peak wtf 😭
I really hope this and their other trailers can get anime fans introduced to Donghua😊They wont regret it
Jc Angela with proper body builder proportions
I was really looking forward to seeing Daredevil in this game, but you guys have already screwed the pooch with his visuals to the max...
All that flair just to get spit on by a fucking pet shark in-game.
God I can’t wait to play Angela her and Emma will be the main reason I play tank
GUANGGANG HERE
Omg! I’m so happy Angela is getting her time to shine!
Iron fist looking at what's going on in his backyard: What the hell is this?
MARVEL RIVALS FOR PS4 LET GOOOOO
Another duelist and a vanguard literally no one asked for. Welp, RIP Rivals. It was nice while it lasted.
One thing yall gon do is eat up the animation!!!!!
Based on the way these two heavenly BEASTS are built, and m holding out hope for two vanguards. This season is about to be lit
She built like Brock Lesnar
Ema vs angela tank battles gonna go off. Bet both sides stop fighting just to watch too
Am I tripping or is that Aleks Le
Another female vanguard mommy? I'm sold. I can't just play Emma forever.
That ult line goes absolutely hard
So easy for them to both be dps, but tell me they both NOT dps and the devs get a bonus.
A blind Catholic man fights an angel; more at 11.
Angela as a vangaurd damnn didn't expect it 😂
I have no idea who that lady is but daredevil looking peak
PS4 LOGO??
Ain't none of you insta-lock dps touching Angela she a Vanguard she ain't for any of yall
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
WE are one tricking Dear Devil
THANK GOD! angela is going to be a vanguard!, everything was resting on this season, but im really hyped! PLEASEPLEASE GIVE US A NEW HULK SKIN! ITS BEEN 5 MONTHS!
Marvel, ATP,  just make a netflix series please.   Also when is deadpool gonna be released? I really want him 👅👅
I'd let angela conquer my 9 realms
U.S. Agent: "Don't Need Saving. I'm Right With God" Daredevil: "If You Were... He Wouldn't Have Sent The Devil"👹
Team - “Our DPS is selling!” DD - “I’m blind Asshole!”
This animation! What is this!
Please be two tanks! Please!
Lego PS4 I'm joining the Spiderman gang and portal trolling
Опять новые ДД?) ееее
What in the world is going on 1:22
ANGELAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.    *YEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSS*
Omg, this is so hype!
Marvel Rivals, give me your bank account, from now, all my salary will be yours.
Daredevil better be immune to the *blinding* effects of Cloak's Terror Cape ability
Apart from DD and Angela I’m excited by the new artistic design of the next maps, it seems we will have a new style that looks nice! Just please no more throne of knull style of modes pls.
Holy peak animation dude
fix the matchmaking
The man without fear is here ❤
Those muscles omg 😭, also its cool the devil and the angel are both releasing at the same time, oh and did I mention about Angela's muscles...
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I can't wait until I can start daring my devil xd
trailer giving me Asura's Wrath vibes
MARVEL RIVALS HOW DARE YOU NOT PUT THE ANIMATERS AND VOICE ACTORS NAMES IN THE DESCRIPTION?!?! You need to give them all raises right this instant. I don't care bout nothing else, This shi is PEAK.
🤯 This is one of the best trailers for anything ever‼️
Impact frames 😭🙏🙏
So sick 😂
Ayee even more instalock dps! les goooo!
Please for the love of God tell me she's a vanguard. They can't keep getting away with this (infinite DPS choices)
No te juego, pero te quiero mucho Marvel Rivals
another case of daredevil fighting someone he can't handle
I wish he's the new bp
why there a heart beat at the end of the video? skills teaser?
why i feel like this version of Daredevil like Khazan the berserker?
Daredevil BORN AGAIN!!!
Don't remember the last time overwatch released a trailer this hype lol
Season 3 : phoenix vs symbiotes Season 4 : devil vs angel  That is so damn cool
Gotta turn off the screen to play Daredevil
Let.. the devil... OUTTT!!!!!!!
Guys , PS4????????
imma sound stupid... whose the hot one? no not daredevil...the other one.
WHO IS SHE? NAME
Yeah, yeah, tell them you have been beaten by a blind lawyer!
So we get another DPS great
Maybe YOU won't kneel to Angela, Matt, but...
Why Angela giving one winged angel????
Death by snu snu 😏
Animated tv show when?
THEY ARE COOKING
Take my money ❤😂
I really hope both are tanks because if we're getting another DPS for the second season in a row, this game is cooked.
Daredevil is sick but Angela? What a stupid character who evern is that? It could have been Thanos, Deadpool, Dr. Doom, or anyone cool, very bad choice.
Tf did they feed this Matt
This looks amazing. I still want Cyclops
Everyone is just talking about Daredevil, but who is the woman???
Marvel Rivals without villains, aka rivals. When will we be able to play as other villains besides Hela and Ultron?
Why tf Valkyrie is so buffed 😭 ?
Daredevil and Angela having a Love/Hate relationship was not on my bingo card. They really are Rivals. I just realised that she is Spawn's Girlfriend, so I really hope that Spawn gets added and Todd MacFarlane says yes to this collab.
Dear Marvel Rivals devs, I hope my theory is wrong, but please make the next female characters are more like the previous ones and not like Angela, of all the characters there were, she is the least feminine there is, she doesn't look like a woman and that's what made your game loved, we saw female characters, really beautiful female characters, in an era where most female characters look more like men in modern games.
Waiting for Red and Frank team up.
Is it just me or does this look like an anime opening
Another 10 billion duelists comin right up
I guess it's time for reinstall the game
amazing
Getting real close with that date guys
Cool. Now fix your toxic community and Broken Enmatch matchmaking framework  and I might continue buying season passes...
Is that Angela? Wow, deep cut for a character pick.
THE IMPACT FRAMES!
They couldn't get charlie to voice him?💔
DD =punisher x spider man x iron DIH
DD def gonna have an iron fist install super
waiting for DD to get a glock with the Daredevil-Punisher teamup
ME CORRO VIVOOOOO CON DAREDEVIL POR FIIIIIN
fine i'll watch daredevil then
BRO STARTED WAVEDASHING ON HER
Crazy Daredevil
Im guessing Deadpool will be season 5.
It's not a bad game at all but Jesus did you mess up ranked I'll come back but you got a who is in what rank
I know dare devil but who is she?
yo what did i j watch foo is this any anime
"You're a demon, sure, but I'm the Devil"
My King Daredevil! Lesssgoo!!!
So uuuhh...a regular blind man with super hearing that is NOT super strong or SUPER in any way besides hearing now fights gods.....gotcha
"LAMENT!", Angela said calmly.
Lame
please fix ranked matchmaking
“Nice to see Daredevil finally in the- THAT WOMAN HAS ABS LFG”
It's sick to hear Daredevil call her a false angel when you consider him veing catholic.
Daredevil is NOT this tuff
Okey cool but I'd rather choose  Street level Daredevil than some mythological something Is there any comic exit which Daredevil have somekinda öf myrhical power like that though
1:13 Is that Patrick Seitz? That roar reminds me of Jiren
Can we get more Vanguards please? There are already too many DPS.
"I'LL BEAT YOU!"  *insert I BEAT YOU! Fisk meme*
Angela is most def a tank 😊. Probably like a sword/spear throw basic attack, temporary flight/ascent, 1 other movement ability maybe, and an Ult spear throw that immobilizes enemies like groot but keeps them where they are, instead of yanking them to one point.    The best I can argue for daredevil is that he’s a dps-tank hybrid like Mr Fantastic. Or Full on dps. I imagine his kit has damage resistance, maybe 1 movement ability, smoke with debuff, and a rage mode-like Ult. Any of those could fit into either role tbh.   I think it’d be fun to have Angela as a dps-like tank and daredevil as a tank-like dps.
If they are both dps im done with this game
All we need is Oden next
⚠️ANTI SPOILER BLOCKER⚠️ (needs top comment)  I had daredevil spoiled for me by accidentally seeing the top comment
Support players got scammed with Ultron launch bro
THIS IS SO AWESOME!!!!
I hope Angela starts every match by saying "I can't wait to get home to my lovely wife, Sera"
They deviate from the mainstream lore in very interesting ways.
Peak is on its Way.  Characters they should definitely also add to Rivals.  1. Deadpool. 2. Miles Morales. 3. She-Hulk. 4. Captain Marvel. 5. Baron Zemo. 6. Cyclops. 7. Charles Xavier. 8. Nick Fury. 9. Rogue. 10. Apocalypse.
Stop giving us heroes nobody cares about like Phoenix, Emma Frost, Squirrel Girl, Luna, etc. People want the Spider-Man villains, Ghost Rider, Deadpool, and X-Men male characters like Nightcrawler, Beast and Ice Man. Don't be stupid and try to equalize the number of male and female heroes; people want badass characters.
2 more dps please
I really wanted to see a street-level Daredevil design... Definitely not one with neon 😢 "my disappointment is unimaginable"
Pls let one of them be a tank 😢
Where are Deadpool?
This is so peak but, in high ranks, there is still barely any good support and tank players, we cant keep getting more dps
PS4 ??!!! Omg....
This is the version of DD i'm not familiar like why he has super powers like he fight a God nowm
Cinema
They overpowered the blind lawyer love it
Kun Lun!?
Imagine neatease hide a third hero for the season even if they say they made 2 hero by season … Imagine fing fang foom as a  flying tank terrorising the back line…
Nice 👍
DEAR GOD at this point we're gonna get every type of woman in the game   BUT Lord have mercy we got dommy mommy
Give these animators a raise cause that fight was off the charts 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wait, PS4? Is this real? Are my dreams finally coming true?
Another DPS? STOP BRO, WE NEED HEROES FROM THE OTHER  TWO CLASSES THAT EXIST IN THE GAME TOO
How great would it be if they were able to get her Spawn outfit from Mcfarlene
0:24 She looks like Malenia but on Steroids 😭
My lovee Angela aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!
Bro please I love DD but no more dps 😭
Deadpool😭
Need jeff emojis back
I can accept this. At least it’s not 2 dps again
I NEED CROSS PROGRESSION.
DAREDEVIL!
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!11
No way they gave daredevil a devil power up. I love street tier daredevil but dang he's cool when we get devil daredevil. Plus I assume the monster is from the hand and it's the beast a monster that the hand used to possess daredevil
Insert wolf tearing off shirt image
Can't wait for that iron fist buff because if he's as weak as he is in his own home of Kun Lun Ill be kind of upset
Imma need some help from the comments, whos the muscle one winged angel lady?
I love the Angela tank, I came to know her from Marvel Snap and it’s awesome to see her here in Rivals
that angela design is not it 😑
Holy impact frames
his cadence sounds like NETFLIX MATT or am I tripping lol
"A devil doesn't kneel before false angels" I got goosebumps Love his design it's so handsome
Marvel rivals y’all cooked with this one all I’m gonna ask when y’all gonna put quicksilver in
Angela looks like more gooner bait and a junker queen ripoff  But MY BOY DAREDEVIL LOOKIN FINE (if only they didn’t give him weird ass magic powers)
He has the power of God and anime on his side.
So do we get a black screen as we play as Daredevil ?
The only thing that’ll get me back on Rivals is the Leader of the X-Men. Cyclops.
It’s peak 😶‍🌫️
Yey more dps XD
Daredevil vs Deadpool would be fun
“Let the devil…. OUUUUUT”  Hardest line I have heard all year
Call me when we get flying Vanguard War Machine and not even more DPS...
This is THE best trailer they’ve dropped
Is that a freaking Angela? Also it may be the first chinese game where they are not afraid to make a muscular female.
The Kingest DareDevil❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Ok. Won’t be getting off Matt any time soon.
Cant wait to not play this game until they make the game run better
GIVE US CROSS PROGRESSION OR ACCOUNT LINKING
holy shet
No Deadpool 😢
What the hell
Another season without a strategist 😬
I just realized it’s just a blind guy fighting a god
How much more tuff can a game get…
Gawddamn angela is bufff
Oh good...Yet another DPS.....?
LETSSS GO DAREDEVIL AND I CAN FINNALY RUN THE GAME WITH THE PS4 YEAA(my pc is bad)
This trailer was so over the top 😂 like an anime fight without the flashbacks. Really fun stuff
This is peak
NAH THIS WENT WAY HARDER THAN IT SHOULD'VE
Wait I haven't been caught up on anything daredevil for a while. Did he get some sort of powers other than his echo location, that makes him stronger. Because it looks like he has some powers in this trailer.
WHO IS DOING THESE ANIMATIONS??
Well hello Muscle Mommy
Thank you God for giving me a new Tank to play with while I goon to
Guess we gonna insta lock dps for a whole season again
Two tanks huh
A flying tanker?
DAREDEVIL!!!!!!!! HELL YEAH
I mean I can wait for deadpool 🥲
After the update we (YES YOU AND ME) are LETTING THE DEVIL OUT on the backlines
The muscle mommy agenda lives
Still using Neil Gaiman's characters in big 2025? 🤔
Looks like DD's ult is gonna be utility debuff with darkness
Oh man they're franchising the town halls now
Those heartbeats at the end of the video must have been a reference to the Netflix Daredevil.
Take. My. Money! 😊
bound daredevil makes me feel things
I have mixed feelings. Do I like Angela's design? Or I see her as too big?
More DPS ... jesus
Heart of the Dragon eh? Hoping Shang-Chi pops up sooner or later.
I hope daredevil doesn't let you see
Two rivals with one mindset and one goal
Goddammit they made me want to play again
Is that third dragon a new character or the main villain?1:33
Gameplay when?
he looks like he'd be a really good lawyer
W
If Punisher doesn't say "Lemme tell you sum' Red" I don't want anything.
Blank monitor gameplay might be crazy
I love angelic things with floating blades that fly at you that’s one of my fav aesthetics
I saw her abs and I’m like “yep that’s a vanguard”
Say wallahi they’re adding support for PS4 peasants
Angela and daredevil are here
Let's goooooo! She looks insane!!! Don't know what I think about daredevil either powers tho
Pause, is Daredevil voiced by Alex Lee?
0:24  I’M NOT GONNA SAY IT NOT GONNA SAY IT
Finally some duelists!
GOD DAYUM ANGELA IS RIPPED   IF SHE AINT A VANGUARD I SWEAR TO GOD
This is just a skin for Dare Devil, right?
Pls let him and spidey have cute voicelines 🥹
Punisher rushing in pushing through everyone "GOTTA HELP RED!"
ANGELAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
So 1 tank and 1 dps again 🤐 as if 20 dps weren't enough we have 21st. Technically 22nd as Ultron is a dps disguised as support. At this rate Rivals can never be balanced. No wonder I have qued up in games with 5 instalocker dps asking "where my heals at?". They are digging their own grave.
Oh wow, you really beatin' the "same-body" allegations like maniacs, huh!?! 🪽💪😍
HOLY BUFF MOMMY. Probably the closest thing we get to She-Hulk in terms of female physique right now
....so flying vanguard???
Better animation than invincible by the way
That's not Matt Murdock.
if one of these isnt a tank....
Just a blind guy btw
YESS
I know she's a tank but DAMN! She built like a female Broly.
Kingpin been real quiet since this Daredevil dropped
“Excuse me, where’s my lawyer? I haven’t heard from him in months” The lawyer:
Last season started on the 8th… why is this one starting on the 12th 😑
1 tank & a dps they should just drop them both at the start then another tank half way in
I BEAT YOU!!!🗣
So much hype, and yet the matchmaking is still in the gutter.  And for the love of god, make them both tanks. We do not NEED another couple of DPS.
SHE IS BUFF AF JESUS
Muscle mummy
Wow, they stepped up on that trailer.
If they ever put She Hulk in this game, we're going to get Thanos Snapped.
OMG a DPS character ill want to play as. Ive been a tank and healer but with Daredevil I now have a dps I actually want to play. 😢❤
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 absolute cinema
Who is that buffed dude and why is he cosplaying Angela?
Is that aleks le as daredevil?
1:13 Is Patrick Seitz voicing Daredevil?? Sounds like him
1:07 anybody else think this looks alot like loki chained up at elbaph
cinema  " Jeff meme "
Please I need quicksilver
"The devil doesn't kneel before false angels" = The Devil should go look himself in the MIRROR when saying that 😃
0:43 I heard the music and it's path to rivals but slowed
What in the anime…. That sequence was so hard.
So we are all Daredevil mains now?
Evil Daredevil and Angela is a crazy combo!!   Really didn't expect them to add Angela this soon
so this is dizang, some rivals OC and not matt? I knew we were getting custom marvel characters but we really using OCs already? and they're replacing existing characters? Bruh is this daredevil even blind?
Praying they’re both tanks
Oh my lord.. what a trailer. Gave me goosebumps. Daredevil looks so good!
Sword of gram mentioned in dialogue this season AND Angela coming next season?  Oh yeah we're getting an AOA Loki skin for sure
absolute cinema
Let the ps4 go man 😭
JUST MAKE AN ANIMATED SERIES ALREADY
LET'S FRICKING GOOOO! THE DEVIL IS OUT!!!!
this looks sooo tea
WHY IS DD DOIN RUNNING A FADE WITH ANGELA BUD???
Ps4 getting a port? What about Xbox One??
Look, sometimes a defense lawyer/anthropomorphization of Catholic guilt has to get another job when his practice goes under. And sometimes that job involves battling a ripped af goddess in (Chinese) Heaven.   The economy is hard right now.
Animators need a raise
I knew he wasn't blind from all the hotties he pulled
Please re-release the lions gaze iron fist skin for this season
Boooo. Give dps a break.
"Stand proud Angela, you were strong" --- Daredevil
Magik, count your days. New muscle mommy has dropped
Ps4? Agora sim eu respeito essa empresa, diferente da Bandai fazendo Tenkaichi 4 pro switch horrível mas não pro ps4
wtf Angela built like a taper bodybuilder man😭😭😭
Angela NEEDS to be a tank because if this is a 2 dps season thats gonna be awful we desperately need more tanks and healers
Ps4 ?
He looks the right kind of beefy to be a tank 🤞
An another duelist and I swear to god she better be a tank!!
why tf did they make daredevil chinese??
Malenia Blade of Miquella
So a tank and a DPS release?
Is the women is magic
Daredevil better come out first
Another two DPS characters …
🧌 RRRAADDDD
i have a theory for daredevils ult, a big smoke cloud is released and no one can see in it. But marks appear above everyones head for only him and he gets a damage buff (above angelas head there is a hand mark when he says the sick line) and there may be teamups for certain characters where they can see through the smoke?
Daredevils PowerAmp is crazy🗿
Chat they cooked
The devils in the details.
We NEED  a TV show in this style!
ANGELA THE SISTER OF THOR LOOKS AMAZING!!! LOOK HOW COOL DAREDEVIL LOOKS... AND WAIT? PLAY 4???? YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH NOW I CAN PLAY WHIT MY BROTHER RIVALS
This sounds like the Blade voice actor for Daredevil. Literally sounds like him just a different tone and cadence for the character. Interesting choice if so. As I can tell it’s the same guy. Instead of the voice being distinctly different from someone else.
First we get a thicc Emma and now a buff Angela with ABS! They really be spoiling us here.
Angela be lookin' WIDE and STRONK, tank maybe?
Drop the marvel rivals series NOWWW
ancient warrior daredevil was not where i was expecting this to go, but hell yeah!
Sung Jin-woo letting the devil out again guys...
MARVEL RIVALS PRA PLAY 4
All we need is bullseye I'm excited when he comes
Ouuu Angela 😍
The design of two are amazing i like the fact that Angela be muscular make sense since her is a valkyri
Marvel Rivals saves UCM...
Sheeeeeeeeesh
"LET THE DEVIL OUT" giving me actual chills
Angel goddess tummy oooouuuu 😭
Wow. And Blind Human vs a an Actual Angel. So are we buffing Humans characters to be strong let than an Angel due to a Religious bias.
"The devil doesn't kneel before false angels" GOES HARDDDDD
But DD is a street level fighter, but you made him equel to a god? She is Thor's sister. What the hell? Why giving him all this mistical bs?
Yo, I'm sorry, like this was epic and all... But isn't Daredevil just a blind guy with enhanced senses while Angela is an asgardian, basically a god? Did I miss something?
why tf is matthew chinese?
Yooooo!!!! Fuckin’ ANGELAAAAAAA?!? Hell yes!!!🙌🏼
Awesome!! Please add Sabretooth to the roster!!!!
And to think I just started watching Daredevil over a week ago, so cool.
Daredevil is one of the worst heros in Marvel Universe , and have a Intro Like a Final Boss . Great Job from the devs .
It’s over
FIX RIGGED MATCHMAKING
This level of animation is only possible because of past Gonner skins.
mommy? sorry- mommy? sorry- mommy? sorry-
Wow Angela and Daredevil is the best birthday gift I know her from the comics
Us Daredevil fans about to eat good!!!
it's look like a mha cut scene
Our screen better be all bloody devil red and only see silhouettes of characters cuz thats all he can see
They made SURE people won't mistake Angela with Dagger Susan And Emma with this design 😂
This literally looked like a movie watching they just keeping getting better and better I hope it’s angel vs demon skins
Angela from Spawn?????!!!!
Please Angela be a vanguard, please be a vanguard, please be a vanguard.
Fun Fact about Angela: She was a co creation of Neil Gaiman and Todd McFarlane originally created as a Spawn character.  When Todd started McFarlane Toys, he made an Angela figure but did so without giving Neil royalties. Neil sued McFarlane for ownership of the character and won, later selling her rights to Marvel as thanks for them helping with his legal case (and to spite Todd).   She is now canonically a Marvel comics character related to Thor.
I just collapsed to my knees from the sheer level of aura Daredevil just unleashed
Alright, I see the vision
THIS COOKED!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bro Angela is so shredded
I dont know what is worst the matchmaking or the map design because both are really trash
For the love of God this game needs more tanks and supports. Idc who they add, it needs to happen
Can't wait for the daredevil throwers that use the excuse that they can't see because they have their monitor off to be "lore accurate"
Plz let her be a tank.
Daredevil mains over here
she’s beautiful
WHY THE HELL U GIVE A BLIND 🥷🏿 SUPER SAYIAN?
this is so ass i can't believe this is for real
Im about to main Daredevil 100% I will get him as my first lord
Please let console player and pc player rank together
So pumped for DD!
Clearly the season the developers most wanted to make. The Dragon and Tiger + Demon and Angel concept is absolutely phenomenal.
Is it bad if i want that you would see absolutelly nothing as Daredevil?😂 Only when you hear something?
Try to fix the trash matchmaking before the game really die soon
Mommy valkerie😮
Loved the daredevil design, hated the Angela design, could have been better
The unemployment rate of players in this game is wild
I love that rivals is buffing characters that would have otherwise been relegated to street level fights. Really gives them a breath of fresh air.
WHAT IN THE CINEMA?!
This is actually awful news
ABSOLUTE CINEMA!!!
Im in soooo trouble when my green girl finally gets here.💜💚
THE IMPACT FRAMESSS
New season ame trash matchmaking good thing this game is dying  because you never listen to your players
Angela looks like a thank? 😢
Meh
Strategist are starving. Not a crumb, nor drop...
1:15 date devil ability? Look at the eye hand. He makes others blind, like cloak?
death by snu snu
DPS RIVALS
I heard she would be a muscle mommy tank but OOO WEEEEE I hope she's my play style
Ps4?!
ps4, is crazy
Absolute Cinema.
All Muscle Mommy sayings aside, this animation is BADASS! Can't wait, fam!
Why does Angela have abs.....
Yoo that’s Aleks Le (voice of zenitsu, Jin woo, mash , and more
I know daredevil but who’s the other girl
The animation in this is literally insane. They continue to outdo themselves every time
It’s peak. IT’S PEAK!!!!
I disagree with the inclusion of such playable characters as angela. I mean its debatable whether she even deserves a spot as an npc and she’s playable before deadpool, cyclops, nightcrawler, silver surfer, taskmaster, luke cage, ghost rider, elektra, man thing even
Can't wait to play Daredevil and Angela in this game.
Peak Rivals 100%
DAREDEVIL HAD BILLS TO PAY JESUS
I hope they're not adding more dps again
This doesn't hope me up at all, it's way to exaggerate. I can feel the despair in this trailer trying to gather players
We got 2 tanks
At least another tank but I'm so done with DPS in the game, they need to stop 🥀
For those saying “This isn’t Daredevil, These aren’t his powers” - reminder that this is a variant we haven’t seen yet. This also isn’t the first time DD has had otherworldly or even demonic powers (Shadowland, Gods & Monsters, DarkDevil, Hand of God DD, ect) so it actually makes sense that he has some otherworldly influence especially being a guardian of the eight city in this universe.  I’ve been a DD fan since I was a kid and I am so hyped for this version of DD in Rivals 🔥
Gordon Ramsey must be the lead artist, because they are COOKING!
They turned Daredevil into Asura
Marvel Rivals is peak gaming.
Prayers for a Luna loki nerf and for daredevil to be a tank
“Are you a yokai” 👁️👄👁️  “I’m much worse”🗿
I love rivals and the video look really good but am not hype for this game no more ever season it the same matchmaking and problem until they fix this game am done sorry
Great seeing Angela again since the SPAWN comics. I hope she's a Vanguard 🤞🏿
THAT ANIMATION IS SO FUCKING FIRE
Imagine animations like this on Disney plus over what we've been getting 😮‍💨  X-men 97 return looked amazing but their other recent animations don't really look all that appealing
I will be blinding myself
This trailer is peak
daring my devil
Matt and Angela are so hot, what a canon 🤭💗
People hating on this game so hard, one day we will all look back and smile! What a time to be alive!!
She kinda Jacked though
I need daredevil now
Why are his eyes glowing? There’s nothing there. His ears should be glowing
i miss season 0
Please, Daredevil as vanguard
One DPS and one Tank I'm semi ok
My comp games are now ruined with that GODESS in there, my focus will only be on her 😫😩
How will they pull this off on PS4?
So...another DPS?
Can’t wait to play rivals on my ps4
Them fighting is unexpected but so perfects there is actual tension here and it makes sense. Angela is def a vanguard im so happy and will definetly be our first flying one. Im not a huge fan of DDs look but its not bad rather unique interesting. im so fuckin pumped.
All that just for Black Panther to still be perma banned by piss low support players
Daredevil learned the impact frame technique from Phoenix Fist skin intro
Daredevil’s VA sounds a lot like Aleks Le.
Dd and noname
Two new Vanguards?
Everyone SHUT UP my lesbian muscle mommy IS HERE. No one else is allowed to play her.
AAAAHHH!!! DAREDEVIL!!!!!!
The Devil of Hell's Kitchen is here I'm super excited ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Angela: immovable object Daredevil: unstoppable force
*Marvel Rivals in PS4* 💀
Two gingers back to back nice
Wtf 😱😱😭😭, it’s so beautiful!!!
Those impact frames holy. Great trailer
Yo that Angela design is fucking insane
Holy PEAK 😭
THE GAYS ARE WINNING THIS SEASON CAUSE WE GOT MUSCLE MOMMY ANGELA!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
yes, no tank or healers again, very good marvel
We fr got Angela before cyclops that’s insane
2 tanks please
Are these gonna be their default skins??
The best Marvel game in the market.
Marvel Rival Devs have a consistent pattern of starting each season with a new girl
I speak for everyone when I say! WE NEED a Marvel Rivals short series or film or SOMETHING! This animation is too good!
Dard devil one more dps😒
Can't wait to randomly walk off the map as Daredevil
Imma need that
I wonder what power up DD got in lore so that he’d be able to fight that other character who idc about but ik is powerful
Should have been deadpool 😢
I like Angela sure but we got WAY bigger characters we should be adding rn before her. Cyclops, vision, kingpin, spidey villains, thanos, kang, modok, war machine, like fr what are we doing. Angela ain’t even a c list character bro.
Yo Angela got to be a tank
Aleks Le acting his ASS off as Daredevil in this trailer!
Get rid of namors team up and we’re back
YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Malenia? Blade of Miquella?
I’m happy for Angela because it’s another tank to our 10 total tanks (Sarcasm) but we really need more strategist in the game
Yo Angela got to be a tank
1:12 want to have this as a live wallpaper
PS4 before Switch 2? that's weird... 😅
YEAH!
Damn where's my lawyer at
what in the naruto sasuke fight was that holyyyyyyyyy
The angel vs devil - tiger vs dragon theme goes so hard
This is so cool, but Im gonna be that guy... Thats not Angela... She was never a super jacked bodies lady. Yet Im still going to play her when shes released.
BROOOO IS THAT ALEKS LE
Matt Murdock really said "bish I didn't read about you in the bible"
MORE DRAGON SKINS MORE DRAGON SKINS MORE DRAGON SKINS
Daredevil really went full Illdian Stormrage there.
And just like that the game is no more
HAWK GIRL!!!!! LETS GOOOO!!!!!
I never thought I’d see the day when Emma would be dethroned as the bulkiest woman in Rivals, by a FLYING tank at that, as a vanguard main my heart is singing right now.
1:22 it looked like BitBeasts came out of the BeyBlade
"we focus on strategists." ... ye strategists ... i see... thanks for the 23rd and 24th dps.
WHEN tf was daredevil ever moving like this 💀
Un abogado ciego partiendose el hocico contra  un ángel, fascinante.
They’re allergic to dropping trash trailers
WOOOOOAAAAAAAAH! 😍😻🤩
DAREDEVIL LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
Another muscle mommy?
Okay sooooooo..........when can these guys make a Marvel Rivals movie? CAUSE THIS IS ARTISTIC GODLY ANIMATION!!!!
Marvel Rivals Devs never miss streak continues
Angela looks so COOL!!! Can't wait to play her!!!
Lowkey mad that DD will probably be a Dps instead of a tank but at the same time DD is finally in the game so I can’t get mad. BRO THIS SEASON CANT COME SOON ENOUGH PLSSSS 😭😭
I love both designs, but HOLY MUSCLE MOMMY ANGELA
At this point just make a damn anime cuz this is fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Looks like he’ll be leader of The Hand in this version. Smart, as they can incorporate some ninja magic into his kit
Huh, beefcake Angela is giving off tank vibes for sure, but also strangely Daredevil. Deflecting projectiles with his senses and sticks almost could be a tank ability.
Will she be a vanguard? Please?
Angela is a DEEP CUT but then again so was Luna so yes cool though
Am i tripping or is everyone going over the fact that its releasing on ps4 too? 😭😭
COOOOOKKKKEEEDDDD
foda
This animation needs to be studied.  We need marvel movies by netease
And y'all thought I was a goon for Emma. I haven't reached my final form.
Delete wolverine
Now we gotta deal with ps4 players who just now got the game 🤦🏾‍♂️
this is tuff
The screen better have some sort of filter over it when you play Daredevil or I'm out (making the entire game look like his "world on fire" would be awesome)
we got Malenia 2.0 but buffed
I need a rivals anime made
"let the devil out" -- *shows DD on chest* Is this Daredevil? Nope, it's an Iron Fist skin :l
Is his passive js a black screen
THE ANIMATION IS TOP NOTCH AND ANGELA AND DD LOOK SO FUCKING GOOD!!!!!!!
Bruh they designs are Peak I don't know who Angela is but she looks like the biggest badass oat 🗿
*WE GET IT NETEASE, YOU'RE A CHINESE COMPANY.*
No one believed me when I said it'll be an angel vs devil theme.. it's so obvious though. And then the execution is flawless 🤓🤠
PLEASE GIVE US SWITCH 2 🙏
Cooked with this trailer, good lord
Ohhh I just understood what his ult does, It blinds everyone else while obviously daredevil is the only one who can see them in the cloud of smoke
muscle mommy vs blind man
Insane build on Angela lol, suurely that means Vanguard yes?..
Why they giving daredevil this much motion 😮
can’t wait to get windowed by cloak and nothing changes
A new muscle mommy
Best ult voiceline on the game
Holy hell.
What daredevil  is this??
Trailer fire 🔥
I don’t like Angela design, daredevil looks amazing
Loved the last season and this is looking to be another great one as always. Again the trailer goes hard and I love the style and animations they have going on. Love dragon themed stuff. Interested to see how DareDevil will play. ❤️🩷🐉
1:34 ps4?
Built like actual tanks😭🙏
LETS GOOOOO
I just know that a certain subsection of the player base will absolutely despise this Angela design
Angela please be a tank 😭
So, that's valkyrie?
Angela is a BRICK HOUSE! <3
Espero que ambos sean tanques
You know what we need next character ghost rider
Yooo this looks sick asf. And its most  likely a dps in daredevil and tank in the...  ummm... This woman i dont know the  Marvel characters well
Does anyone know their voice actors?
Zzzz
Aleks Le on his quest to play every mainstream aura farmer
Does that angel lady know she’s beating up a blind guy?
Manipulative matchmaking that wastes player times by slowing their progress in "competitive" play ruined this game. 👎🏽
Fire
A NEW VANGUARD YESS!!
I love that they are using a lot of lesser known Marvel characters in this game. I know a lot of people know characters like Daredevil and Blade, but I can almost guarantee that 1% of players (Including myself) knows who Angela is.
Angela probably going drop first which is good cause we need more tanks in the game . Hopefully this help the tank pull cause you know everyone going be thirsty to play the new character
Characters to add Victor Alvarez: support Luke Cage: tank Beast: support  That's all I have
What is this COOK ! Amazing !
I'm so tired of eastern aesthetics...
We have a flying tank now! COOL..!!
I thought this was a superhero game it feels like it wants to be an Anime 😂
Finally🎉🎉🎉 my real main is coming DAREDEVIL😃😃
Can't wait to see Angela get some well deserved spotlight!  Also I wonder if Iron Fist will get a Danny Rand costume since it seems this season will have big Iron Fist /mystical city themed! 🤞🏻
God I hope they made DD a tank. His whole thing is being able to take hit after hit and never go down.
Hand versus Daredevil ..........
Dear god this is cinema
PLS MAKE THE RANK SOLO WIN RATE MORE!!!
This looks cool as hell and im super hyped but i know for damn sure that daredevil is a dps and that is absolutely not what the game needs rn
🔥
Los de que PS4: SIUUUUUUUU🤩❤
That is one badass lawyer right there
PLS MAKE THE LET THE DEVIL OUT AS HIS VOICELINE INGAME!! That gave me chills holy shyt
God DAMN!
This are gonna be awesome
2 *MORE* dualists
A coughing baby vs an 140 megaton nuke.
OMG I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO DAM HYPER FOR AN UPDATE IN THIS GAME BUT DAM!!! I also just recently started rewatching the Daredevil series and this is a treat don't know much about the girl here, but she looks lit ASF too. GOD I'm excited, can't wait to use both of them
Remember if you were right with god he wouldn’t have sent his devil after you
What did you do with Angela? She doesn't look like the comic book version. And if Emma was a successful adaptation, Angela is a complete failure. God, why does her sister Hela look amazing, but she doesn't. I wonder what inspired you. Good luck with the online in that case, Daredevil is the last hope of season 4
I hope Daredevil has some kind of filter on screen to simulate his "vision" Would be dope to have a red filter and shockwaves under players footstep he could see through walls.
0:41 wallpaper shot
Matt Murdo ❤
This is to animeish to be Marvel
its so peak
Booooo Angela
Ok, time to return to rivals. I love dragons
Another duellist I see rivals, we have big problems here
isn't daredevil just some blind guy who punches? why he got demon powers lol. Isn't he street level? the hell is he gonna do against an Asgardian
Flying tank was inevitable
PEAK
NUH UH THIS SEASON IS PEAK, like the trailer, the impactframes, oh god they cooked realy hard
Wow really amazing animations and desings
malenia?
This might actually be the greatest character reveal of any video game ever. Holy animation team
This is my lawyer btw
The man without fear is coming!! 🔥🔥🔥
I can tell the devs are fans of Asura's Wrath with that punch Daredevil does.
That was intense 😮
Heaven vs Hell in a Dragon vs Tiger Depiction?  Yall cooking
I am so ready!!
DONT SAIYEN-IZE DAREDEVIL
IM JUST IN LOVE WITH THIS DESIGNS!!!!!!!! Thnk GOD and other entity NetEase exist
HOLY F*CK CAN WE GET THIS TEAM TO ANIMATE A SHOW????
Who tf are these crazy ass animators, my god its amazing.
the VAs are absolutely cooking. that let the devil out goes hard af
I reeeeeally hope Angela is a tank. I'm dead certain Daredevil is going to be a dps, and I really didn't think we needed more for another three or four seasons after season 3 added two of them
Is the other character Aldrif Odinsdottir? Lost sister of loki and thor, firstborn of odin. If so, another obscure character, nice.
I was thinking it would be Halloween themed.
Damn this is tuff
KEEP DAREDEVIL STREET LEVEL STRONG
Bro is SO MAD, I LOVE IT🤣
Ps4 about to blow up
Damn, still no Gambit :(
Awesome scene, noticing a distinct lack of Ghost Rider, so 9/10
This Animation is crazy
PEAK! PEAK! PEAK! ITS PEAAAAK!
It makes me feel like a little child seeing one of his greatest heroe on screen, in this case in MARVEL RIVALS W
Daredevil going from fighting Bullseye to the daughter of Odin
1:29 what’s that in the bottom left hand corner?
0:35 THATS ME BRO
Cinema
We need a Marvel Rivals animated series on Disney+ A-fuffin-SAP with this art style!
Yess more dps so this game lose more players yesss
YOOOOOOOO LETS GOOOOOOOO
Local blind lawyer throws hands with warrior god, is even match.
wow I can’t believe they’re giving us 2 vanguards this season!!!!!! (I’m staying delusional until I can’t anymore)
Why do they always hold onto this Asian sht,like why so many Asian themes,like c'mon man,so many skins on this theme,and now a whole season,cmoooooon!!!!
What they did to my boy matt?
oh dis gon peak, and it seem were not just gettin daredevil  , were gettin the possesd version of him ( i forget the name ) judging from the powers and the asian themed outfit . Except it seems like he has mastery over his possession and a clear mind. i feal like there gonna make him a hybrid of iron fist and moon knight . And angela is probably be like magik and hela as a tank
Netease I love you guys and I’m really hyped for this season and the new characters but like I need DEADPOOL next season pls no matter what just put my goat in the game pls😭😭🙏🙏
I am begging y’all to release Daredevil first.   I don’t even know who that lady is.   I doubt more than like twenty percent of the people here know who that is.
I swear if Daredevil has magical abilities then I am not playing as him. If they change him and give him extra powers it will be the biggest fumble of all time
Now that we got Daredevil, now we need Deadpool and Ghostrider ASAP
Such a shame the matchmaking sucks ass 🤦
Ok they gave Matt more powers and I’m FOR IT. Looks hard af. “LET THE DEVIL OUT”
Daredevil need the permanent wallhack
Can we actually get a new healer 😅  . and no Ultron is not a healer😅
Bro who let them cook my phone is on fire 🔥
it’s so peak 😭
Uhhhhh is daredevil on steroids or something? I don’t remember him being able to do all that 💀
blind character, do we need to use only our ear to play him?
Oh bro thats the voice actor for Zenitsu...no wonder that was peak
I need both of them to be vanguards
FINALLY! I have been waiting for daredevil since i knew about this game
So the description identifies daredevil as dizang. Is this not Matt? Cause that would be interesting and curious?
Bro what is this "Dragonball rivals"
Yeoooo that was FIREEEEEE!
👌
DAREDEVIL!!!! ❤️❤️❤️ LET THE DEVIL OUT!!!
Bro they do such a amazing job on these trailers for just a free game
Angela is looking like a tank?? Maaaaaybeeeee?
The devil never neels
Can someone post a reference where DD is actually this powerful?
HOLY MOTHER OF BUFF
ANGELA AND DAREDEVIL YESSS
I love Daredevil but Angela's got this by a mile.
At first I was like mommy 🥺 then. Now I’m like DADDY🤪
Absolute Cinema 👐
wait is Angela gonna be the 4.5 new hero then? if so it's time to become a muscle mommy enjoyer
Angela and Daredevil are the new characters here and can't wait to see if Amalee is voicing Angela and I'm 100% knowing Angela is coming first then Daredevil last
She is malenia, blade of miquella
ALEKS LE!? SOMEONE MAKE A JIN WOO MOD ASAP!!!
Hope the animators are getting more rest than Mappa 😭
Angela ❤
Why does it say PS4 at the end????? 😮
Wow neat but thats not gonna make me reinstall your awful game again mr netease
Bless these animators, OMG
Peak incoming?
I hope Angela is voiced by Denise Poirier.
So Angela clearly a Vanguard. Is DD a support? As a support main, I'm going to lose it if he is (in a good way 😅)
DDs va definitely sounds like Alex Le, I hear the Jin-Woo in that LET THE DEVIL OUT
HE'S HERE!!!!!!!! THE MAN WITHOUT FEAR!!!!!
Why are there 2 more Duelists?
Jesus fucking christ. You didn't need to go that hard on the animation.
OOOOKKKKKAAAYYYYY🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🎤
The actually gave Daredevil powers wtf.  Maybe I should be a lawyer
They are bringing Angela to MARVEL RIVALS I haven't seen her since Spawn not many people know about her but trust me she's like that
So let me guess. No new strategist till Season 5 😅😅😅  This game started well, but not last so long...😂😂 Im glad I started play Overwatch again.
Of course the muscle mommy restrains her enemies
Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry.
So ready!!!
at this point just make an anime already like damn
PLEASE MAKE A SHOW ALREADY! Animation is TOUGH!
New main.
Looking respectfully.... 👀
This is gonna go CRAZY
I’m glad Daredevil has some sort of extra abilities in this like his own little phoenix force
This will save Rivals
They did not need to cook this hard with this animation 😩🔥🔥
whys angelina look like that no bye full on wanna be body builder
Yeah I’m done after season 3. Weak season that was about the symbiotes g0d and we got a weak performance. I’m out
Looks sick af but I really hope they’re not completely changing daredevil’s character to be the host for an actual devil or something
IS DAREDEVIL VOICED BY ALEKS Le??
ANGELAAAAAAA
Seems like they went with a more Japanese oni design for Daredevil
1:35 why does it say PS4?!?!?
Fix. Match. Making. You are destroying your player base.
I wonder Kingpin reacts a this trailer's daredevil...
Plot Twist they decide to make DD a Healer instead of a DPS I hope that’s the case just to piss off all you insta lock mains cause at this point 3 DPS in the last 2 seasons and still no Tanks or Healers is actually insane
Ok this is pretty cool gotta admit
Daredevil 🔥🔥🔥😍😍
Ps4? What?
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING IT TO PS4 🙏  YOU'RE F*CKING AWESOME!!! ❤
We need double vanguards dammit tired of solo tanking
WTF!! Most epic trailer ever released o_O
Angel versus devil, they both look marvellous rivals
Daredevil dps confirmed and no one can’t possibly tell me ONE thing to prove the opposite. Angela, well she lowkey may be a tank so tank players rejoice 🎉
IS THAT MY GOAT DAREDEVIL???????? HE IS COMING WAAAAAAY SOONER THAN I'VE EVER EXPECTED AND THAT'S A VERY GOOD THING TO SAY. I CAN'T WAIT MAN.
THE IMPACT FRAMES ON INSANE!!!!!  I'M GRINDING DAREDEVIL THE MINUTE HE RELEASES HOLY CRAP
This game cinematics are so beautiful, definitely snatching this battle pass up 🙏
Bro they added anime impact frames to the trailer, I literally CANNOT feel my ass 😭
we got demon slayer and marvel rivals sept 12th lets frikken go...
My boy Matt Murdock won't be fooled by a false Angel
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Gonna let the devil out with this one
Don't make daredevil support , He s one of my favorite character, don't screw him up
ayeee i didnt expect Angela Odinsdottir, we need to just add odin and gaea so the family will be complete
THE HELL WAS THAT
i cant believe this game just keeps getting better
its gonna be peak.......................................................................................
How is daredevil going toe to toe with her?
Angela went from fighting Spawn to Daredevil  What at a transition!!!?
Glad we got another duelist! We really neeeded another one....
I swear to God if Angela is not a tank I'm a fuckin freak 💯
Crouching Angela🐅, Hidden Daredevil🐉
MARVEL COOKED AGAIN, WHO CAN STOP THEM. 🗣️
Spawn coming in hot
Daredevil Joins Marvel Rivals!
omg 😊
A new duelist every month is insane. Can't be sustainable for the team.
Flying Vanguard Flying Vanguard Flying Vanguard
I hope they do their research on Angela and realize that there is more to her than just those weapons. The ribbons are another asset to her.
WE NEED DEV DEVISION. NOW.
Mappa look like toddlers compared to the Netease animators of my fucking god
Angela, Blade of Odin
Local blind man vs literal Asgardian God. He really is a good lawyer.
I'm so happy to see Angela. I really loved her design in the comic
There ain't no way she's that beefy and isn't a tank/vanguard.
DAREDEVIL LOOKS SO COOL
ALEKS LE RAAAGGGHHHHHH
Well the new Iron Fist MVP isn’t gonna feel special anymore lol
BUFFED WOMAN LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BIG W FROM RIVALS
i cant lie i think marvel rivals can come back with this
yayyy....another dps.....
So we get 3 new duellist as the 4 latest heroes ? The role that already has the most heroes and probably a new Vanguard. I'm disappointed by the lack of diversity they add to the pool of champions especially the least played roles ...
omg😢❤ devillll
Who's the chick...?
Great, more DPS characters. Just what we need.
Angela ❤️🤩🌚🥶 Daredevil 😤👏😋😀
As much as the art team is carrying this game, every other aspect needs addressing.
wow
wait, daredevil has a stand now?
DareDevil! LET'S GOOO!
Já era hora, estava até desanimado
Ok, I asume that Angela Will be a Vanguard, AND Daredevil a Duelist
Fix matchmaking
if Angela is a duellist aswell next season better not have 1
1:12 giving Devilman Crybaby vibes 🙌🏽
Wow another Duelist …
I'm glad Angela has been officially confirmed but damn I don't like how she looks.
Thank Asgard another tank 🥲
Dis not dare devil
Soooo why do we need another DPS after getting two last season. Angela is likely a tank and I DOUBT daredevil is a support.
GIVE US GHOST RIDER AND DEADPOOL NEXT SEASON.
no need to buy a ps5 for marvel rivals 💅😝
They are Cookiing once again they are coooking as always cant wait for DD and punisher team up , and new dare devil season 2 release coming up soon
Daredevil protecting Hela and giving her the chance to atone for her sins is the most Daredevil thing I've heard, and here we were thinking he was going to be mind controlled / the bad guy.
Tooough
MY GOAT DAREDEVIL
another dps yeahhhhhh
PS4!
"YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE WITHOUT FEAR!!!!!" Sooooooo excited for angela esp as a tank main ❤❤❤❤❤
Hey is their another certain character that’s Red carries to Glock and is know to be a loose also going to be added during this season as well
The devil's avocado
Please add placement matches for ranked queue and also a Solo/Duo queue and a Flex (3 teammates+) queue to fix the unfair party smurfing (when 3+ party members smurf at the same time). Adding these two features (placement matches and solo/duo queue) will save the game!
dd is gonna be the fist hero? pls i want him
This looks like an anime
Ts so peak
YO THEY GOT MARISA FROM STREET FIGHTER 6 IN MARVEL RIVALS
FODA. Dito isso to no guardo da season 5 para jogar com o Colossus
Bro I really hope Angela is a Vanguard!!!!
I need a crossover with spawn an immediately.
Awesome! But i wait Cyclops
WE ARE LETTING THE DEVIL OUT WITH THIS ONE 🔥🔥🔥
Not the greatest fan of this Daredevil but I'll be damned if i dont play him
Ps4 deserves it ngl it literally run higher performance games than rivals
I hope Angela's a tank she already looks like one
amazing
Yep, DD is gonna be day one Lord i'm telling you
She looks like she might be a tank! A tank with wings!
“I’ll beat you!” and “Let the devil out!!” The VA is so good, the screams are akin to the Daredevil Charlie Cox is portraying… excited for my goat
DD has been added my time has come to uinstall and grind on this game
Yes!! A new vanguard!!! And a new duelist i guess. At least is Dare Devil
Second tank mommy?
Don't let mappa find this
father I ask for forgiveness, not for what I have done... but for what Im about to do
This fight reminded me of the decisive battle between Angela and spawn 🤩🤩🤩
Marvel with a chinese infulence
No playable Knull? I'm out. At least the angel lady looks cool.
Okay you have my attention again...
I need a DD emoji of him doing the ace attorney objection desk smack
Great, now fix your matchmaking and announce placement matches.
we BROKE guys won COMING to PS4 !!!
Wtf is this animation, please make a movie with this budget
Add Warmachine as an anti air tank
I guess the classic all red suit isnt good enough for them…
Bro where DareDevil get all this? What comic did he do a fraction of this in??
Does THICC Angela mean she is a Vanguard? Hope so
Angela my beloved
Joe Rogan is foaming at the mouth rn
DURÍSIMOOOOOOOOO🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Me cagué y me puse a aplaudir
This is the best thing I've ever seen.
Im so very happy to see daredevil at last in this game, quite exciting, hope he is fun
Wow! Testosterone Angela does not looks like we all imagined😂, but Daredevil looks the opposite of what he looked like in Fan Arts.
Muscle mommies in rivals before gta 6?!
Disappointed with Daredevil
Damn we got impact frames in these now
Another season without new supports? 😥😥😥
"LET THE DEVIL OUT" goes so hard. PS4 version, too? Oh damn my console is gonna run like a jet engine
Super cool. I'm excited. Last season wasn't really my thing. What do you think?
MUSCLE MOMMY ANGELA!!!
He certainly didn't see that coming 😂   Can't wait to play as the devil of hell's kitchen 🔥
This is where the Luna's skin money went to
Buff Lesbian vs Blind Acrobat. HYPE
I called it, knew they were gonna have to give DD some kind of power or magic upgrade because otherwise he wouldn't last in a hero shooter, not with just STICKS!
One day. One day we will have a movie with this much consistent quality.  EDIT : Or an entire show that's going to be named Lord of Mysteries
Guess you could say this Daredevil is “BORN AGAIN!”
More frames than seven deadly sins
pls a new tank and sup, no more dps
The town halls better be free this season... I NEED a super saiyan Iron Fist
I didn't know that Daredevil had actual devil powers. I thought that hes just a blind dude with great hearing, hightened senses and reflexes and hand to hand combat expertise
Yes.
Let the devil out just better be his ult
Can someone tell me who that female character is? I’m not well versed with comic so I have absolutely no idea who she is
Angela AND Daredevil? Oh yeah, Rivals is cooking today!
Still waiting for Marvel to make a animated series with this art style 😔
ANOTHER 10 DPS CHARACTERS AND NO LUNA NERFS WOOOOOOOO I HATE VARIETY
if Mad can't see the characters in invisibility, it will be a huge disappointment and a loss of the character's essence.
Please let Angela be a Vanguard, pleeeeeease let's not do 2 more duelist
amazing
Yeah………Angela is 1000% a tank. Gave her the Emma treatment 😂
GAME OF THE YEAR
Man I thought it was Deadpool
I CANT WAIT, DAREDEVIL LOOKS SO PEAK THANK YOUUUU NETEASE 🙌!!!!
bro why does it look like he has like super powers (beyond his senses) and lightning whip bro thats not daredevil
Flying tank!?
Angela would bear hug and cripple DD but this trailer is SICK
Thats Heat.
We are so back
I hope Vanguards get a major buff. otherwise insta lock DPS lobbies.
THIS IS WAY MORE AWESOME THAT I EVEN EXPECTED I'D BE AHHHHHHHH
THE MAN WITH NO FEAR
LOVE THE DAREDEVIL
ONE MORE DPS! LETS GOOOOO
"MORE STREET TIERS" -Angela
I know who daredevil is but who the hell is that bombshell??
ofc they gotta make everything chinese...
Holy crap we got Malenia in the game
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
I hope at least one of them is a tank
Been looking forward to Daredevil coming into the game for a while. Let’s gooo
daredevil is my favorite super hero of all time and hes finally in no more playing bp and blade i geuss
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT HOW IT SAID PS4 AND PS5 AT THE END?!!
can't wait to ask for heals only for a daredevil to come along with the prayer button held and heal my soul.
Hopefully that big girl is a tank
Awesome! Now let me play comp with my friends again
Angel and devil. I get it. Weird that they went with Angela for the angel instead of Warren Worthington. Archangel would have been awesome for the game.
That looks dope
Man, count me for the ps4 I play all day if i could
Animation this good NEED a tv show
That Daredevil design is CLEAN. We Need a marvel rivals show so bad.
Yea let’s a a random character nobody knows Angela !
I'm retiring if they are both dps
oh dam
Super dope trailer but like…. 2 MORE DPS??? Come oooonnnnnn
Angela looks weird af
Subtitles say Dizang, others are saying Angela.... Can she just take me now?
"Sybau ur honor u werent even there" - The Daredevil
Absolute cinema 😮
Are they just downgrading quality of the game for PS4 just cuz of switch 2 Nintendo doesn't care about 3rd party games and only care about there own games
I really hope it’s Matt and not someone else
🥺
Now i can tell my teammates their trying too hard to cosplay Daredevil
is Angela a tank? is she gonna be flying? my 2nd main after Emma finally they listened ❤
They HAVE to give daredevil an ability where he can use his sonar hearing to see where enemies are
Actually really sad they didnt get Charlie Cox. He would have 100% nailed it.
Where is our Animated series! We need it yesterday, This is so Peak🔥
Nah the budget for these is getting out of Hand
I thought this was gonna be about iron fist
Damn, I thought for sure it'd be a Wastelanders themed season
Is Aleks Le voicing Daredevil
Why is no one complaining that yet again we got another DPS character? 🤦
Why is daredevil fighting an asgardian
another amazing "who is this" pick by the rivals devs.
Praying for iron fist buffs for Lore reasons ofc
can't wait for DareDevil, I hope he gets MCU skin
PLEASE LET DAREDEVIL BE A VANGUARD!!!!!! Double vanguard for season 4 would be top tier!! 👌 but imagine DD being a mix between Cap and Iron Fist with a mobility just shy as agile as Iron fist
Espero que haya referencia o que confirme que meterán a She-hulk en Marvel Rivals
So glad to see Marvel Rivals coming to PS4
Even after this there's gonna be people who still think it's gonna be deadpool lol
CAN WE GIVE THE ANIMATORS AND VOICE ACTORS AND THE SOUND DESIGNERS A RAISE?!
I will literally give this entire game team a 100% increase in pay
I swear if we get one more dps and no healers
Can't wait to see y'all get mad after finding out Angela canonically has a wife
Meh
She is on them ROOOOOOOOOIIIDS
Por fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin salio la presentacion, se confirman Daredevil y Angela, quiero ver que puede hacer el Diablo de Hellskitchen
Haven’t played rivals too much lately but that was gas might have to pull up for this season
Yay another DPS!  🙄
Did not expect dare devil thats so cool
We got a former Spawn character in Marvel Rivals before GTA 6
Wtf I see now , that's peak 😮
Jaw fricking dropped 😲😯
"The vestments of the holy cannot disguise your wickedness!" "God forbid."
Oh hey you can see the PS logo in the end screen.
Yay no support again(joking)
Hope this isn’t 2 DPS
Okay guys. If we can keep the enemy team contained within this one hallway, we've basically one.
I know it’s a long shot but Spawn would be so perfect if they managed to do a collab 😱
Wow two more dps
please at least angela has to be a tank! not 2 dps again!!!!
Hope they're both vanguards
Damn, what a really good lawyer
Why at first did that actually sound like Charlie Cox
I like the trailer but im extremly worried
ANOTHER DPS???
We're getting a DPS in tank I feel bad for healer mains feels good to be a tank main
Season 1: 2 dps, 1healer 1 tank season 2: 0 dps 1 healer 1tank season 3: 2 dps 0 healers 0 tanks Season 4: 1 dps 0 healers 1tank Total (not counting season zero heroes): 5dps 2healers 3tanks   Do you understand how crazy this is there is barely any options for tanks or healers THATS why the game is getting boring the important roles aren’t getting characters or at least interesting ones
Angela Tank confirmed
Looks like peak is back on the menu
Shoulda been kingpin, not a red head when we literally just had a red head lol, Ik they gonna play different but atleast add ones that look different, we need more tanks bruh,
Shadowlands!? They’re doing a Shadowlands with my horned boy!?!
The heartbeats at the end of the trailer remind me of the Netflix Daredevil opening sequence. Great addition!
I hope Angela is a tank I cant take another season of 2 dps
I was expecting Deadpool to show up and ruin (improve) the vibe but this was cool.
lol another dps
Nice 😎👌
Netease please make the new dommy mommy a flying tank!!!!
DD and Angela got nothing on GuangGuang
That dude in red looks cool, but who is he?  “Daredevil.”  That street level glow up is worse than Tom Holland insta-Avenging.
Not really a fan of their desings, but I guess that’s something
I imagine a future Deadpool skin (and character) to come to the game dressed in a bob ross outfit ready to “beat the devil” out of dare devil
Mommy?
AYE MAN THIS TRAILER WAS GAS!!!!! one of the coolest trailers for a game I’ve seen. AND ALL THIS BECAUSE MATT IS A REALLY GOOD LAWYER
0:35 FINNALY all i need now is deadpool and sentry i will even take thanos or green goblin
Flying tanks before gta 6
I white tear just dripped down my leg
If Angela turns out to be a DPS, I'm uninstalling
Those interactions between Daredevil and Punisher are gonna go crazy.  "You hit em and they get back up, I hit em and they STAY DOWN!"
Daredevil has NEVER done ts 😭
Thank god this game is third person
Matthew Murdock my absolute GOATTTTTTTT
MEU DEUS DO CÉU ISSO É INSANO
and deadpool ?
hype for the new characters but why is this in a chinese setting..... like wtf and angela aint that buff.....
I can officially say we are cooked ima fkin Dps main and im tired of seeing More and more dps being added i know guang guang said they gonna even things out and ofc its gonna take time but why are you keep on adding more dps man they should both be tanks man, i cant wait to see mr fan becoming a tank, and can we have more villians please ??? I literally want thanos, Dr doom, Modok gor the god butcher and much more
Make an animated tv show already 🔥
THEY PULLED OUT THEIR DOMAINS RUN!
Daredevil here fighting against women bigger than him again
Love it
oh wow another dps...i cant wait...
Ps4 confirmed 🫡
More dps. 😔
The animation is just salivatingly good, my eyes are eating like kings.  Anyways, Iron Fist better get a legendary skin on this event.
She got the abs 😍
Pls for the sake of this game dont give us another dps
Holy.....mommy...
by far this is the best season trailer i cant wait till the update 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Cloud Strife vs Sephiroth: Marvel Edition
Would be cool if you could only see the sound waves instead if seeing normally when playing Daredevil
Is the Daredevil VA Aleks Le? Aka JinWoo from Solo Leveling
So the leaks were really TRUE.
YES YES YES YES YES YES! MUSCLE MAMA ANGELA! YEEEEEEES! I'm so excited holy shooot she looks gorgeous ABSOLUTELY Gorgeous, on 1 end she looks swole and ripped AF! on the other hand her face looks GORGEOUS! BEAUTIFUL! I got my main people..... until we get She-Hulk and maybe even beyond! I'm sticking with Angela. My only hope that she is a Vanguard and then if someone took Emma then I can go with Angela!
Holy cow I'm early, This actually rocked..  0:24 MOMMY ???
All of this... just for Hela?!
BUT WHICH ONE COMES FIRST! PLEASE DEAR GOD GIMME DAREDEVIL FIRST!
Angels and Devils season and no Warren Worthington III or Nightcrawler I’m literally crying and throwing up (I am so excited for Daredevil)
Impact Rivals
Bravo netease, bravo 👏🏽
So fucking cool!!!
mannn this game always makes my pockets hurt, but ALAS..
For a Cinema company, Netease does make some good games..
I barely touched season 3 tbh idk what it was but I wa a just kinda over it the new character look cool but I havent even touched them i hope I get back into this
THAT ANGELA DESIGN HOLYYY
Oh please tell me that's a vanguard
Look how they butchered my queen
So I'm guessing based on the trailer we're getting daredevil last 😢
1:12 woah, Daredevil went Super Saiyan!
I was actually watching this trailer thinking "Yeah, maybe I'll get back into this game." Then I see "PS4" at the end of the trailer. There is no way in hell that I am hoping back into this game and playing ranked matches with PS4 players. 😂
i'm happy for new characters i just feel like we have enough dps rn. like we're ending a season that quite literally gave us 2 back after back, just to get another one in the next season. we either need an all tank season or an all support season but the dps need to stop for at least ONE season. it's hard enough to get a team without 3 dps instalocking and throwing already, we're just enticing them more🥲
Both are great character choices
On one hand, Angela and DD.  On the other hand, at least one of them should be a Vanguard. We've been getting DPS and Pseudo-DPS for several releases now.
Its funny how only PS4 gets ports of next gen games  YOu know why...
blind lawyer vs a god btw
If you like Angela's design, you're sick. Not even the Hulk has that many muscles. Put a wig on CBUM and you have Angela.
Ummm yeah this doesn't look that good, not trying to hate but Daredevil is a street level hero he's not supposed to have cosmic/godly mystical powers, is cool to see Angela though.   But I'm not so sure about this, especially as this will be another new DPS great to see another tank but we dont need more DPS especially after just having 2 and let's face it Ultron was basically a dps with a healing drone.
RIP Iron Fist, make way for the new DRAGON!
surely that flyer is a tank right SURELY
Angela is cool but I wish Daredevil would be a vanguard
FINALLY A NEW TANK ANGELA PLEASE BE A FUN DESIGN
This got really good we have Daredevil and Angela, two of the best characters ideal for Marvel Rivals 😁
OMG SUPER SAYIAN AURA  ASF !!  SO 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Seems like dd might be a second cap. If they're both tanks that would be perfect
New hero Valkyrie?
THE ANIMATION🔥🔥🔥
Okay boom my theory Anglea wants Hela cuz the valkeryies  wants to punish her for siding with  knull and daredevil don’t wanna give her up
Flying Vanguard??? Can I dream?
I'm honestly so here for Daredevil
They have cooked again!
She looks so good He looks so amazing   The Devil and the Angel ❤🥹
WERE EATING GOOD TODAY CHAT!!!
Aura
Strength build vs Dex build
Angela She's Are Awesome Rivals
Gg no heall!
Daredevil!!!!!!!
A Tank finally 😭
I love how they made the characters huge just to justify them being a Vanguard. Well, at least it is not 2 duelists again
Charlie Cox skin when?
Since when can daredevil go super Saiyan 😂
New vanguard
I can already see it next season:  Iron Fist and Daredevil Duo diving with their fists finna be legendary   Invis: HELP DAREDEVIL AND IRON FIST ARE PUNCHING ME BACK AND FORTH IN THE BACKLINE  Spider-Man: lol now watch me go 1-12 baby
Please let daredevil be the first hero. Y’all keep releasing the female heroes first
"SUBMIT!!" Ain't gotta tell me twice.
1:05 THIS SHI FYEEE 🔥🔥
I can't believe we got Mystical Samurai Daredevil before Cyclops
YOOOOOOOOOOOO
Is daredevil from Psylocke universe? Why does he have proper superpowers
"There are no heroes. No villains. Just different people with different agendas." -Daredevil
LOOK RIOT GAMES! EVEN IF THEY HAVE LESS 50 CHARACTERS AND ALSO USE "BEING THE GOONER GAME" MARKETING TACTIC THEY STILL MAKE VARIETY IN BODYTYPES LONG LIVE MARVEL RIVALS
BIG RED!!!
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Daredevil voice actor sounds like Jiren
Nice now I get blind dps big
Marvel the goat rivals best game ever to exist
Waiting for CARNAGE day 39
Please make a Marvel Rivals TV show with this animation. I will watch every episode
Tank and dps? no healer? two season without healers lol.
Ps4???
What in the unholy name of Shounen Manga is this JoJo nonsense?  Looks cool but not how I expected Daredevil to be portrayed.
Please make daredevil a tank
"dead game" they said
God's It looks amazing, I hope Angela is Vanguard
Oh jolly propably another dps
Absolute peak
I never realised but “Angela” = angel and daredevil = devil. They’re literally opposites
Hear me out, guys, Angela is going to be the first hero of this season. If you paid attention to their release schedule, female heroes always come first. Like in the first season, at release, we got Invisible Woman (alongside Reed Richards, Whatever), then in the second season, at release, we got Emma Frost, and then, in the third season, at release, we got Jean Grey, so I can say most certainly, there is an established pattern to their hero release.
Let's be real for one sec we all know daredevil would stand no chance against Angela but its a cool trailer no less
Bro where the tanks and healers holy
BLIND GAMEPLAY
I don't want these dinky characters
This is so stupid I was excited for Daredevil come to find out he’s now a fucking Iron Fist knockoff with dragon powers😭🤣
At this point, y'all can just have straight access to my bank account cause GOD DAMN
BEST UPDATE YET. DAREDEVIIIILLL!!!!!!
Probably won't even be matt, that costume is buns af. Im so disappointed
Looks so cool
peak
of all the marvel characters yall choose the lamest ones gj
god please not double duelist again
This trailer was insane, did I see impact frames 😭
Can't wait to dive backlines with daredevil only for supports to cry he's OP because they have to engage with the game rather than spam shooting forwards blindly for 10 minutes straight
Community so toxic idk if I can re install this game
INCRIVEL DAREDEVIL
Can’t wait!
That let the devil out was so epic it made me cry. Good on you net ease. He better be a vanguard
Finally i can play blade without weirdos insta locking
Ohhh that's fire 🔥 😮
Great.... Another female gooner character and DPS. I can't believe these guys seriously
I’m still waiting Deadpool❤
Absolute cinema!✋😳🤚
Im actin up in every sense of the word
The devil of hell's kitchen is here finally, new main😆😆😆
Considering how big this daredevil is, he could have easily be a tank
I will sell my soul to NetEase if they make an MCU DD suit
Hmmmms. Daredevil being the Warden of the Eighth City is an interesting twist, but given his history and lore it works. I am imagining this is a DD that merged with the Beast of the Hand but actually has it under control unlike what happened to him in the Shadowland story arc in the comics.  Really like the lore remixes they're doing in this game. Bringing in Angela was bold and crazy, as she's only been at Marvel for a little while. Yeah this season is going to be crazy, and I hope Angela is a Vanguard like her brother, Thor.
Daredevil I Love it
I currently play on Series S, but...  The idea of welcoming players from other generations is great, but what about the Xbox One crowd? It's a slight lack of consideration.
When we finally get DD but he's chinese: No, it's fine. I just… I just didn't think he'd be Chinese.
Mommy
DAREDEVIL
This cinematorapher needs a raise
Omg thats op
That hit different
Wut kind chronovium did daredevil smoke
MATT MURDOCK IS HERE TO SERVE JUSTIC!!!!
So Angela's the next main villain, or is someone else working behind the scenes?
What is the name of this anime
I will be Lord Daredevil within a week, you gon have to peel my off my chair 😈
Ok Angela is a tank and my new main
Let's Go Rivals
Yesss look so good 😊😊
I had no idea Daredevil had super sayian powers. Also peak on the Angela model.
Interesting that it was Daredevil that was speaking to Hela last season wonder what that is all about does he want her to change
Wow they really did it. They really did add Angela. I was saying this as a joke entry last December. That’s nuts.
Peak
nah he looking like another diver we cant handle one more!!!
So the season after this one we're gonna get 2 healers, right?
Its over
Pure cinema 😍
PS4 confirmed 1:36
Sighhh.... another dps...., at least angela is a tank tho.
My grandmother, she was the real Catholic. Fear of God ran deep. You’d have liked her. She used to say, “Be careful of the Murdock boys. They got the devil in ’em.” And you’d see it sometimes in the ring. His eyes would go dead… and he’d start walking forward real slow, hands at his sides like he wasn’t afraid of anything. And the other guy, he’d see that look, and he’d try to get away from him. Nah. My dad, he’d catch him and trap him in a corner. Let the devil out.”
BROOOO ANGELA MY GOAT, SHES A MUSCULAR REDHEAD VANGAURD THANKKKK YOUUUU THANK YOUUUUU I SCREAMED WHEN I SAW THIS, I FLOATED IN THE AIR AND POPPED A LITTLE DANCE THANKKK YOUUUU MARVEL OMG IM CRYINGGG SHES AMAZINGGG
JESUS ANGELA, what's the workout like 😭
They watch a little too much MHA. But the trailer tough though
Great now fix the match making
Pls be tank
Well judging by the comments here I can see exactly why this game is hemorrhaging players to the point where they have to dump it on ps4 for a life infusion.
At least we got a Vanguard. Hope next season we get healers
haven’t played for months because you guys do absolutely nothing against toxicity and guys who are throwing. If this patch brings in a system to help against that i‘m back.
Damn that trailer was pretty sick looking 👍
anyone willing to bet these are two dps ?
That animation and fight was lit
THE MAN WITHOUT FEAR IS FINALLY HERE
so if daredevil is Alex Le will he shitpost as daredevil?
matthew murdock my beloved how ive waited for you
I swear if they don't make when you play DD your screen turns into different shades of Red.....
vamosss
Dead by Snusnu Hell yeah, im in
So they can bring marvel rivals to ps4 but not xbox one, i have a next gen xbox so its not like im going to miss anything, but i find it confusing why they are going to older generations, and why wait so long, alongside the fact of why not xbox one as well
GWYATTTTTT DAYUM
2 new tanks lessgoooo
It looks like Angela’s Ult is her spear that’ll bind folks, while Daredevil drops a massive smoke bomb and turns into Beast Mode Gon from HXH.
Holy crap this looks great
Hype af 🔥🔥
angela is vanguards
Crisanta of the Wrapped Agony.
Daredevil in Comics: Street-Tier to Higher levels. Daredevil in Rivals: Basically a Super Saiyan.
I need to see the most insane cheaper town hall skin
This animation 😮
Man I never seen Daredevil aura farm this much since Born again 😮 And throwing hands with an Asgardian is INSANITY
Bro I’m crying… I’ve wanted daredevil in a game since I was a kid and been begging since release date.
Is Aleks Le voicing Daredevil!?
""LET THE DEVIL OUT""  • 10/10 fav quote of all time and can't wait to use The Man Without Fear with that born again skin day one.
Looks cool but I wish we got more symbiote or even knullifed skins last season. Also I wonder if there will be some spawn references considering where Angela comes from.
Omg she is a muscle specialist mommy
AAAAND its all over the screen
Yes daredevil let’s go
I just shat myself
Is Angela supposed to be this buff? Wow!
Am I blind or both sillouethe looks like tanks 🤑🤑🤑
still no deadpool huh..
Can’t wait to play daredevil and have the screen just be black the whole time
Omg We finally have it, it's excellent and the animation is incredible, I loved it a lot, a lot. ❤😮😊
LETS GOOO DD
wow a new dps yay....
PLZ LET ANGELA BE A TANK
finaly
Damn X-men 97 animation was amazing but these guys have creative touches with their animations
cool! they added daredevil and some random
This video released on my birthday 😔
Angela is going to be so damn cool
WOW
AURA
Angela's armor design is really cool but I hate how buff she is
ABS.
Daredevil is finally awake 🔥
Bro, this reminds me of asura's wrath
why they cooked a whole ass anime for this?? This low k tuff asf
MUSCLE MOMMY
MY KING DD
Death by Snuu Snuu
Darendevil yes i liked hero im happy
That was hot
"i am daredevil not even god can stop that now" RAHHHH
When are we getting a TV Show in this style?
PS4 lets goooo
on my bday is wild
Street level no more
We need a show at this point!
LET THE DEVIL OUT 🗣🔥
Can u guys stop making everything asian themed?
Is he gonna have powers or is that just visuals for the trailer?
All that action had me forgetting this man is literally blind.
That's not Matt Murdock, is it? I hope I'm wrong but it looks like he will get the Danny Rand treatment
🖐😯🤚
3 dps in a row, no changes to Emma, Loki or Luna and games have been the most boring things imagineable. What a drop off.
"You are not the only one without fear." 😎
Literal goddess getting clowned on by a blind lawyer
GOD DAMNNN, Angela is built like a damn brick house 👀
"YOU MAKE EVEN THE DEVIL CRY!!!"
MUSCLE MOMMY
Make them both tanks Please
Angela makes me want to be mommied so bad💀🫡
For the love of God, please don't let both be dps
HERE COMES DAREDEVIL
They'll do anything but release deadpool 😭
This trailer is tough 🔥🔥🔥
Fix your matchmaking first
I’ve always had Hanzo as my main for dps and I hate how they’ve treated him up until now, but he is so frustrating to play against with the size buff. Widow was always getting better treatment than Hanzo even tho they both have one shots but the fact that she gets her projectile size buff fully reverted but he keeps it is lowkey nonsensical
Angela: flying tank  Daredevil: ???? Please be tank or strategist we don’t need more dps
.....................🥵.................. ✋ABSOLUTE CINEMA🤚 ...........................................
guess support heros get no love again. this game is going to die if they keep adding dps heros.
She is too wide, way wide
Please both be tanks
HOLY PEAK
THEY ABSOLUTELY COOKED!
Im not pratical of comics, i know that he is daredevil but who is she?
Oh my goodness.
WE NEED A SHOW WITH THIS ANIMATION,IF TO BE HERO X CAN DO IT, IT CAN HAPPEN PLLLLSSSSSSS GIVE US AN ANIMATED SHOW LIKE THIS AND MY LIFE IS YOURSSSSSSSSSSS Edi: Also, keep the same voice actors, they go crazy.
Finally devil of the kitchen 🤯🤯🤯
Please let them both be Vanguard. At the very least Angela bro
Wow, this is the worst DD design i've ever seen. Very impressive
Good lord what are they feeding these animators??  They keep cooking 😭
Peak. Daredevil. Huh ps4.🤔
When Deadpool is going to appear
angela better be a damn tank with that amount of muscles
Punisher ulting Daredevil: FRANK NO!
Did I see PS4 at the end
We letting the Devil out with this one!!! 😈
Players are screwed if they fight him in a hallway
Im letting the devil out rn
Who TF Is the angel🥀
Damn, the animators knocked it out of the park
This trailer was mad ghetto …
Give the animation team a show pleeeeaaaasse wall angla is fine
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
IT LOOKS INCREDIBLE. DD, MY BOY
Why is Daredevil's armor so... asian?
YES! They look amazing !!
MAKE THIS INTO A SHOWWWWWW
absolutely, undeniably SICK!!!
this games life expectancy will not last long. considering that the last “support” character was ultron, and he was released 3 and a half months ago….so if daredevil is another DPS be prepared for the same support meta for the next 2 and a half months
LET THE DEVIL OUUUUUUUUUUT❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗
I don't really like the Daredevil Ninja design 😔
WTF this animation is so insane !!!
GUANG GUANG HERE🗣️🔥
Ohh it's all over the screen
Animation omg
Yay my favorite marvel character is getting in my favorite Marvel game
Another season with no support characters, actually an L
Daredevil is awesome but Angela's looks don't convince me
*"The Devil doesn't kneel before false angels."*  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥✍🏾
pros: peak animation, another muscle mommy, my boy matt murdock, fire season theme. i legit got chills  cons: another dps (i am about to pass out, we have not had propper support since season 1)
No supports again i might just play the bad healers so i can actually have fun. If yall not getting enough heals in my game blame rivals for not adding supports :/
absolute cinema 🙌
Daredevil is built like Cap. Surely a tank?
This has that same feel of an epic anime fight 😮‍💨
I shall be a SOLO TANK NO LONGER I REBUKE THEE TITTLE!!!
0:25 HOLY MUSCLE MOMMY🥹
who the hell is this, this is not my devil but I want what he's having, jumped from street tier to angel tier
I will adapt my entire playstyle to main Daredevil
All this for a game that can't stay over 100k players 😂😂
No supports for this season?
Play station 4 never dies🥀
We better get like all vanguards and strategists for the next season or two this game still has a DPS bias problem.
I didn’t realize Angela had abs 0:25
more dps
Absolutamente cinema
Damn wait so Angela coming was real? And I was hoping it was going to be a Double D season (Daredevil and Deadpool)
OH MY PEAK
Don’t LOVE daredevils mask but the rest of the fit looks SICK, can’t WAIT
THAT’S FUCKING CRAZY I LOVE IT
I'm excited for DD but another DPS 😭
Give your animators a well deserved raise NOW
Some incredible animators are wasted on making trailers.
Con este tráiler me queda calor que , necesito un anime de Marvel con calidad atta of Titan o jujutsu kaisen 😮
What does a dragon even have to do with daredevil 😭😭😭 he's just a guy. This game becoming too chinese every moment, and who even is that girl
He’s so peak
Wish his default design was more traditional
So Daredevil is a ninja and has Cosmic Powers?
Who is the feather lady?
Marvel rivals add to PS4 ,OMFG
The animator deserves a raise!!! It’s so fire and hype 🔥🔥🔥
My boy is coming letd goooooo🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Daredevil Being evil and posessed... SHADOWLAND CONFIRMED?!! 😮
the dragon becomes me
HOLY HYPE
The budget is BUDGETING
Big lady, i'm sold. Absolute Cinema.
BEST trailer I have seen for Marvel Rivals so far! We need a animation show like this man
YAWN this looks so anti climatic...
0:24 Mommy? Sorry...mommy?
bro there isnt even any way of twisting this into a healer or tank not another double dps season 😭😭😭 rivals is cooked
There better be a born again skin for daredevil. I NEED IT!!!!
LESSGO A TANK PRAISE THE HEAVENS
Is that Angela from spawn?
Is that Angela from spawn?
I of play when yall put DD in game and Cyclops
When it comes crossprogresion??
God bless you with mountains of gold and silver, God teach you not interrupt dragon-tiger fight, so lets just stand by and watch guys :)
So from the looks of things Angela's ult seems to be that binding spear and Daredevil's ult blinds everyone around him(think of it as a aoe cloak darkness).
Day 10 of asking to be able to purchase cosmetics from the skins like emotes or sprays separate from the skin itself
I hope this is Matt Murdock and not "Zidang" or whoever that is
I thought the leaks were probably right, and I hope they are very right about her being a vanguard because we need them! Also she's hot hot hot. Can't wait to play her.
1:12 let the devil GET OUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT !!! LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Dammnnn they r cooking..
God damn that animation
The best lawyer ever is here 😮
The ppl waiting to a Emma Frost X-Revolution and they giving muscle 😂😂😂😂😂😂
YOOOO i wonder how Double d and punisher are going to interact in game
Love that in every universe Dare Devil is always aura farming
WHAAAAAAAAAAT IM IN TEARS
god i love being a lesbian
MY SWEET KING GUANG GUANG THANK YOU
Putting that summer money to good use
dead game
finally a new tank
Let the Devil May Cry
From a Hawk to a Devil, what's next for Marvel Rivals?
THIS IS SO PEAK!!
ayo why is angela so buff? she looks like she's 9 feet tall!
Oh yay, another Valkyrie in a battle bikini. Cool.
both at the same time
PUMPED, please be a tank
✋️😈🤚
Chales... Yo no puedo jugar Marvel Rivals por que juego en Xbox One... 😢😢😢
0:24 I love how buff you guys made Angela because it reminds me of 90s comics
WoW
At this point, this studio needs to do what Riot did and make their own ‘Arcane’. The animation is getting REALLY good.
We got a temu elden ring boss before Deadpool 🥀
No way they give Daredevil a Devil Trigger.
She's so buff and so awesome... absolute cinema
Is that Jinwoo VA or am I tripping?
Please not another flyer
I hope the animation team is getting a raise. They out here making cinema.
They are making this version of daredevil with these powers to explain why we can see the game when we play as hik
OMFG THIS IS ACTUALLY PEAK ✋😐🤚
REF DO SOMETHING IT'S ABSOLUTELY PEAK
I hope their both vanguard
I hope Angela is a tank
HOLY CRAP ANGELA AND DAREDEVIL! HYYYYPE!!! Also the animators need to make a Rivals show, the animation is insane!
WHAT ARE THEY FEEDING THIS GUYS
Gracias por tanto y perdon por tan poco Rivals
Guys, it's coming to PS4.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN PS4?!!! FINALLY I CAN PLAY RIVALS?!!!
Let’s go!
This game is apparently now on ps4 too, still hoping for a switch 2 version  Super excited about daredevil & Angela
Yay another Chinese theme season
Lawd have mercy
Is that a vanguard I see? 🎉
So is daredevil going to be a villain or the whole demon thing is just an explanation as to why he can fight against literal gods?
This makes me need ghost rider even more
This was TUFF ASF 😤
They really got matt out here fighting gods like hes gonna do something
so daredevil blinds enemies with his ult and marks them?
oh that’s another dps
OH GOD FLYING VANGUARD
aleks lee is voicing daredevil? holy fucking peak
Daredevil can NOT move like that.
Couldn't give a toss about the female character, but i guarantee you've decided she comes first and make us wait until second half for daredevil 🤮
Yes mommy 🙏
Angela from Spawn
Angela on some Roids ain’t she? 😂 I LOVE IT 😍
ps4 logo....
I can't wait to play Daredevil in six months when all the instalock DPS finally get bored of him.
Please tell that wont be the default design for DD
The Art Team is amazing!
FAHHHHH 1:10
FINALYYY🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
OMG 🔥🔥🔥🔥
BIG GIRL! 😍
They def one piece fans with the impact frames!!
give us a new tank please
Buff woman? Hello~
need the new iron fist skin NOW
PlayStation 4 but no Switch 2?
We are eating good!
Shouldve been mattea murdock daredevil instead of just normal matt
Angela releases her inner Sephiroth! 😇🪽
Youuu give the animators a early thankgiving break cause the were popping off 🗣️🗣️
Is there a reason that Angela only has one wing?
Omg we are having peak devil in rivals already I can't belive it 😭😭😭🔥🔥🙏🙏
All this for Daredevil’s ult to do 8 damage on launch and for him to get nerfed every patch
why is lawyer just fighting god
For people who doesn't read the description here's a short summary, hela gets imprisoned in the eight city, dizang dares hela to repent, angel woman doesn't forgive hela and order dizang to give her to her, dizang refuse and that's it
THIS IS INSANE TF
Daredevil (in most media) I’m just a blind guy  Daredevil (rivals) My stand is a dragon, I fight gods and LET THE DEVIL OUT!
Animation Getting better each season!
YO CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW RIVALS MAKES ANY CHARACTER LOOK JUST AMAZING, like i can feel dare devil can go toe to toe with gods bro. I'M ROOTING FOR HIM ALL THE WAY AND I BELIEVE HE CAN DO THIS SHII
The last part gave me Goku VS Frieza vibes
LET EM COOOOK!!!!
Fix the broken textures on ps5 pro already!!! Ever since ultron released you bugged half the games textures now leaving them low res or non rendered!!! Fix it now!!!
Daredevil another dps…
I hope we get heaven and hell skins
for your ranking system the game will die very soon
The way I yelled after he said “The devil doesn’t kneel before false angels”
THE GAME IS NOW AVAILABLE TO PS4!
Im about to sell so hard on ranked with Daredevil. Iron sharpens Iron. I hope its a easy learning curve
That’s definitely Aleks Le voicing him
This Angela character model is one of the worst I’ve ever seen
Dare devil just became an instant main
Local lawyer throws hands with a literal god. More at 11
Damn so if DD had powers
Incridible Animation 👏🏻👏🏻
that animeton is 2d or 3d
uuuuuuuf
Wait.... PS4?
I DONT CARE ITS EOMM OR NOT, JUST FIX IT. Remove chrono shields and add placement matches
Peakkk
что сие за х на этот раз. вот тут к неработающему балансу добавляется нечто не очень
The blind lawyer is already here...
Are they releasing game on ps4 now?
DAREDEVIL AND ANGELA THIS SEASON????? OH THIS IS SO PEAK!!! I know that we need more supports and tanks but man I love Daredevil so much!! THANK YOU NETEASE ❤❤😈😈
0:38 you know what else devils don't do
Is that the same DareDevil I know?? Damn...bro really said "let the devil out"🔥🔥😂
Pls be a tank Pls be a tank Pls be a tank Pls be a tank Pls be a tank.....
Daredevil and Angela! Sweet!
I love this game and the character design artists
Awesome animation and theme 😊😊😊😊
DD wilding I would’ve folded 🧎‍♂️
Does Matt Murdock support David Baszucki in the schlep situation?
Pa4 comfirmed
Is Angela going to be a flying Vanguard!? 😮
They should just make a show at this point
IS THAT MY KING ALEKS LE?!
Neil Gaiman, whatever happened there
If this Murdock is anything like the Netflix one by the end of all this they will end up in bed together, Matt has a type lol
Wack wanted tank agatha
OH MY FUCKEN GOT YES!!!!!! Let the Devil Out!!!!!!! 🔥
ALEKS LE RAAAAAAHHHHHHHH  DAREDEVIL MY NEW MAINNN  I USED TO PRAY FOR TIMES LIKE THIS
oh thank god it's not Deadpool
This is what Ive been waiting for since the release of the game... Thank you
Wow, big lady 😰
It's gonna be so peak if Daredevil was a support
0:25 GOOD GOD 😱🤯 she beefy not complaining been asking for more tanks
I love how we have a SPAWN character in rivals. They made her so badass looking Jesus Christ!  I still have her original figure from 95 😅 now I can have a tank main I don’t care how she plays I’ll become an expert
ps4 ?
They both look like vanguards
Muscle Mommy
So a Tank and a Dps ?
"Hey can I get some help, I'm getting dived a lot-"  "THE DEVIL DOESN'T PEEL"
No actual healers again
Sees Angela 👀  Can someone more talented than I, mix One Winged Angel to the background music? ✋️😅
i think i will avoid playing her for the same reason i avoid playing venom.. i just dont like them visually, their kit seems cool tho
Daredevil is either being possessed by something, or this version of Daredevil is the Iron-Fist. Even if he is Iron-Fist he is definitely getting powered up by the Dragon to be able to fight Angela. Either way, both look great 🙌🏾
Xibalanque Ult for DD?
?????
Realistically who wanted Angela in the game could’ve added deadpool, vision, cyclops, silver surfer, ghost rider, the list goes on so many more well known cooler characters to add
aaaateee
While I do LOVE Daredevel and Angela I do wish Deadpool could just be in the game by now
I love how they pair characters that usually have no connection in comics, but somehow make PERFECT sense.
Mommy? Sorry I meant… MOMMY!!!
Another DPS FFS
Now to wait for all the Angela edits with Sephiroh's theme
Fiadaputa... mó irado!
man they LOVE references
DID DAREDEVIL JUST DO A GODDAMN RAGING DEMON?!?!  PEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAK!!!!!!
I need them to make a Rivals animated show cuz this is 🔥
Sephiroth: A fellow one-winged angel I see.
They went crazy with this I can’t stop watching it!
Netease can we get some Marvel Zombies Skins???
Bro she's gonna be so peak and imagine if she a tank flyer bro..
What is with the impact frames 🙏
Oh boy! I want Kingpin in this game
This will be peak
Stop making duelists
Another dps oh lord😢
Insane they made daredevil a cosmic being 😂 BUT IT LOOKS SO SICK, IM HERE FOR IT  Edit: WHY did they give daredevil a DRAGON 😭😭😭 i hate how lore inaccurate this is but I fricken love how it looks, I'm excited
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS! HE'S HERE I'M SO HAPPY.
We need an iron fist team up
MY FAVORITE MARVEL SUPERHERO IS HERE LET'S GOOOOOO
game died the minute they added AI voice banning
Animation is solid but jeez this looks awful
El Diablo 😈
I've been waiting for Angela to be released to play this game, now is the time. She was my main in marvel heroes
Thank goodness Angela looks like a Vanguard thank goodness!! 😅
MY GOAT, MATT MURDOCK, AND ANGELA, LET'S GOOOOOOOOOO
Daredevil DPS and Angela a strategist?? She’s all about light and it kinda would make sense
After daredevil says “let the devil out” Angela has some pink thing above her head. Anyone see that?
MARVEL RIVALS ADD THE HAND OF GOD SKIN AND MY LIFE IS YOURS
this is so fire gng, only thing that upsets me is that my boy matt murdock is a dps, we need supports and tanks like water
MY BOY IS MORE BADASS THAN HE'S EVER BEEN I'M SO HAPPY!!!!!
I want gamora
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS
Fix Eomm
Matt went from “Boxing with the Fixer” to “Box with GODS”!!!
1:18 I wonder is this part a easter egg for Hela. According to the lore, she's a prisoner there so I assuming NetEase is teasing something with this since it looks like Hela's crow.
0:25 GOOD LORD THATS ALOT OF WOMAN! 🤯🫠 🫦
Daredevil and Angela finally in the same project, let's go
Istg if daredevil is a duelist I am carving the date on this games tombstone
MARVEL ZOMBIES NOW THIS LET MARVELLLLL COOKKKKKKK THESE ANIMATIONS CLEANER THEN THE ROCKS SHINY HEAD
Daredevil is gonna be a dive dps and get perma banned
Hopefully Angela is the first one to release, need the tank
too many garbage hand combat heroes.
Why does DD have powers tho?
Ts is a whole anime 🙏🔥peak!!
THIS IS FREAKING HYPE LET'S GO!!! THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO WORKED ON THIS!! <3
I NEED THIS SEASON RIGHT NOW, THIS MINUTE, I NEEDED THIS YESTERDAY
Why does that say ps4? 😂😂😂 net ease trying to burn people's houses now?😂
I'm sold, give me all the cosmetics
This trailer is INSANEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!       Buff Spider-Man.
DAREDEVIL
Beautiful can't wait
That is NOT a street tier Dardevil xD
Bruh dare devil is just aura farming
The chinese are cooking
ANGELA OMGHHHH
this trailer looks very similar to imperius vs diablo cinematic from d3. Diablo walking out of the cloud, an angel with a spear, dareDEVIL, heavenly light and all that. I think they took inspiration from there
How many times you watched the trailer?  Me: lost count
So Angela is definitely a tank right
the goat
holy the animation 🎉🎉🎉 leta go
The art... the dragon and tiger... the Angel and the Devil... I've never seen something so beautiful in my life.😭😢 I'm not crying you are.
I knew they was gonna give daredevil future sight (it’s from one piece)
“LET THE DEVIL OUT” 🗣️
lemme guess, dps
Who tf is Dizang
Daredevil really be fighting anyone at this point, truly the man without fear.
Y yo justo dije que si salía  dardevil este estaría poseído por la vestía del clan la mano 😅
Just make an anime at this point ever animation is PEAK!!!!!
AAAHHHHH DAREDEVIL!!!!!
make a show pls ~ you'll have people hooked forever (disney+ needs to get on this)
LET THE DEVIL OUT
is this Daredevil &  Angela Odinsdottir, Thor 's sister?
For anyone doubting Angela would look big enough to be a tank... Damn!
Someone get these animators on a show.
"No, it's fine, I just didn't think it would be Chinese is all"
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssss❤
Like we need more gooner bait lol
Jaw dropped 😮❤
Another duelist, finally some alternatives from playing the same thing every time!
"LET THE DEVIL OUT!!!!" hits so hard 🔥🔥🔥
When Iron Fist and Daredevil find me alone 😢
OH DAMNBNB
Add cross platform progression
Wait... PS4? I'll finally be able to play it? 🥹
1:16 there’s a simble above Angela’s head, looks like dd’s ult is gonna cause a blindness affect
sus
1:08 play that Netflix theme!   I never thought I would see Angela in a marvel game, she went a long way from being a spawn character
1:34 EXCUSE ME? THE HELL YOU MEAN PS4?!
Neat. Did you fix matchmaking?
WAIT IS THAT ALEKS LE I HEAR???
Need playable villains characters... Currently there almost none
Not even Matt Murdock what are we doing
Rivals dev cooked hard 😮😮
Got a full anime fight scene for this one
Amazing cinematics. so well done🤩🙌🙌
Please add Cyclops!!!!!!
6’9 women
Its real guys
"So this 'Daredevil' guy... He probably has a devil in him, right?"
LET THE DEVIL OUT
Daredevil look sick as hell
It's another DPS, isn't it...
Double dps or tank and dps (daredevil being the dps) those are the only things I see here
Flying tank
Looks like she’s a tank🔥
Nahhhhh....meh characters  choice ..no hype no nothing
Please anger every Duelist only and make them both Vanguards. I will die laughing at their anger 😂
Angela’s and Daredevil’s designs look SICK AS HELL! Can’t wait to try them out!
Oops All DPS
Imagine at some point if we got ironmonger as a poke/brawl hybrid tank
Quién va a llegar primero? Ojalá sea Ángela😭
Thank God Angela is in this season because daredevil is not hype for me I hope she will be at the start of the season
Why is daredevil suddenly...asian...
A NEW TANK!!!!
Fix your matchmaking
Angela SAVE Rivals 👏
They got Aleks Lee for Daredevil????? Insta locking immediately. His fit looks absolutely fire too!
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSsssssss
Oh my god….mommy?
THE FUCKING DAREDEVIL GOT ADDED
This my lawyer yall. IM GOING TO JAIL 😭
I'm starting to see a trend where they release a well known wanted character every time on the second half of the season...  They got us waiting on Daredevil
I LOVE YOU RIVALS, THANKS
Who is the Daredevil VA? I really like him a lot for my boy
I wonder what the story is with regards to Daredevil having mystical abilities in this trailer
So the Tank Angela will be able to root people for her ult and dare devil has a ult exactly the same as maeve from paladins 100% thats the ability gimik here xD. If anyone wants to know what maeve ult from paladins is like basically it cuts off sound and causing vision blindness which is apparent from this trailer.
PEAK DAREDEVIL! ABSOLUTE, CINEMA!
Please Vanguard
By far the best animated trailer by Rivals holy Angela looks terrifying way more than I could have expected
oh....thats why she's a tank.
angala is the most tank looking charchter yet, they reely didnt want us wandering
I NEED A MARVEL RIVALS ANIME BRO I'LL PAY FOR IT
Another fire season ahead of us
This is the most sauced up daredevil you will ever see in your entire life
PS4 Really? Can we let that console go damn
Bro she is big as hell but that boi daredevil 🥴
yall launching this the same day bl4 comes out? lol I'll play this season late this time.
Abosulute cinema ✋️🗿✋️
SEEEE, EL MALDITO DAREDEVIL
0:24 😍 Hubba ubbba
PLEASE TELL ME THEY ARE VANGUARDS NOT FUCKING DPS AGAIN!
Give us more tanks god dammit
0:52 DETROIT SMASH!!!!!
Angela's inclusion is the closest thing we'll get to some form of a Spawn presence
Absolute cinema 🤗
Hear me out, it’s a long shot but Daredevil as a support who heals through prayer
Daredevil doing too much
Hoping to get some Sera references now that Angela is officially in the game 🔥
Omfg omfg omfg omfg omfg omfg daredevil let’s fucking gooooooooooo
amazing trailer!!
Does anyone know when the trailer for BP will come out?
Fix your matchmaking and optimize your game
Since when daredevil has those powers lol
Daredevil with the Satsui no Hado XD
Angela gigachad
THEY BLEW IT! They could've gotten DragonForce to do the music here!
OMAGAAAAAAAAAAHHH
Marvel Rivals S4 trailer: Muscle mommy and possessed Dare Devil Overwatch 2 Wuyang trailer: Twink
Okay Angela better be a tank, cause god damn she is jacked....also would
Angela is making me like muscular women even more
Ps4 ? What kind of witchcraft is that ???
The new support looks terrible
I've been SO FUCKING EXCITED for Angela
Trailers keep getting better. Game keeps getting shittier
Plis i need Marvel Rivals in Nintendo Switch 2 plis
This year is going soo fast
nice skip season
Yup it’s all over the screen with this one😩
No new supports?.......yay..........see you in season 5
So it’s coming to ps4 but not Xbox? Crazy
Marvel rivals animators are awesome
HOLY MAMACITA WHITE QUEEN GOT A COMPETITION!
She-Hulk vs Angela battle should look Legendary
That ps4 release is finally coming out
Pleaseeeee don’t let DD be a duelist. Anything else. Like, I get it, but please don’t. 😭
Pls make them both tank 🙏
Tf is Daredevil gonna do against a literal god slaying angel woman ( I will play him day one )
2 duelists? that sucks the game needs more tanks and support
Ts looks mid asf ngl it will be good for 2 weeks then it will die
No more dps please for the love of god
how many impact frames  YES
I like how they can’t directly mention Daredevil’s Catholic so they keep skiriting around it
We can only hope they're not as boring as Blade and Phoenix
Me playing Daredevil when he comes out: wait why is the screen black?
I’ve been waiting for this… Matt is finally here…
Angela got me foaming at the mouth  godDAMN
I really hope he's blind in game and you gotta rely on some crazy passive mechanic
PEEEEEEAAAAAAAKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dardevil se que eres ciego, pero debes ver esto
“Peter, the lawyer is here.”
My bad guys can I have dibs on the angel muscle mommy..?
guaranteed we're getting this female character who no one knows first then daredevil who every one wants second half 🤦🏻‍♂️
That daredevil design is cheeks tho no lie
Ok that’s a sick trailer!!!
this is peak 🙌
DAREDEVIL 😊
Literal chills
Well...maybe season 5...
At the end of this trailer was PS4 logo, soo Marvel Rivals is coming for PS4 ? But how old harddrive in PS4 will handle the doctor’s strange’s portal’s ?
Yall cant make an entire season based on Iron Fist and not buff the guy pls im begging.

They got daredevil out here fighting above his weight limit. I love it
1:09 gave me goosebumps, Matt going crazy!
This went extremely hard. Looks awesome 🔥
lets go, my ps4 is about to catch on fire.
Angela is a unit, OMG
The animation is gorgeous, omfg
Absolute Cinema that's all I'm saying ✋😐🤚🔥🔥🔥
HE'S FINALLY HERE! LET'S GOOO!
They're really bringing it to PS4? Wow lol
Hoping we get more villains in the future Carnage and taskmaster would be so good
this looks so unbelievably hard
Now we need Spawn
Ahhh I love Angelaaa
MAN WHAT IS THIS? THIS IS SO PEAK, MUSCLE MOMMY ANGELA AND DAREDEVIL
0:43 no way they added hawk girl
Daredevil looks god awful
I read "Heart of the dragon" and thought Shang-Chi, but this is just as dope
Is this aleks lee voicing daredevil?
SHEESH
We don't need another dps
Snuu Snuu that's all
This animation is so sick
Glad to see they gave us a proper Angela.
Daredevil Confirmed That Like Blade in Season 3.5
Yay more DPSes.
So no new healer yay
The devil vs Angel The dragon vs tiger This season gonna be Peak
When fix matchmaking?
ANGELA!!!!!!!!!!!!
That cool and all but how about they fix the matchmaking.
finally daredevil!!!!!!
Damn S4 coming already
Daredevil’s VA went absolutely insane
Iron fist buff ?
we are soooooooooooo back 🔥
THIS GOES SO FREAKIN  HARD HOLY-
DAREDEVIL OMG I AM JUMPING LIKE A KID
MY GOAT FAVORITE CHARACTER EVER DAREDEVIL IS HERRRRE LET THE DEVIL OUT😈‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️🔥💣👑🐐♾️
LOOK AT MY LAWYER DAWG, I’M GONNA BE JUST FINE!!!!
This trailer was incredible!! I cant wait to see what changes they have in store in terms of balancing, maybe some pc optimizations (since game is rumored to be coming to ps4 as well) and anything else.
That Dare Devil suit sucks, wtf even is that
Isn't Angela from spawn?
PEAK animation
DAREDEVIL YAY!!!
Wtf
Please be a vanguard and this trailer is awesome 🔥
peach momoko pockets this season gonna be filled to the brim
Street Fighter 6 has Marisa and now Marvel Rivals has Angela. Muscle Mommy's
Holy mother of Mary! That was amazing!
M.... Mommy?  Muscle Mommy? Angela is now?
daredevil my goat
PEAK
Peak animation
Buaaaaaffff!!!
hes a really good lawyer.
Great another 2 Dps season
0:24 Que Macizo!!!!
Maybe Dare Devil is a dual Rhienhart heart type? like he is agile but he Fights with chains. Instead of blocking his shield dodging for brief intervals. Angela might be like Junker queen that would be bad ass!! Ult seems like Groots tho.
What the hell...
The people who make these trailers need a massive raise
I need a marvel rivals show in this animation right NOW
Aleks Le very nice to see you again
Damn Matt looking beast in rivals
So is Daredevil a hero or a villain?
I know everybody wants daredevil to be a DPS, but please I’m praying he’s a vanguard. It would be so cool.
I'm assuming this is Danny Rand Daredevil and not Matt Murdock but we'll see
so Dhizang is Daredevil in their universe. Interesting.
Wukong animation ahhh
Is this on ps4?
We need Supports, not more DPSsssssssssssssssssssssssssss  LISTEN TO YOUR PLAYER BASE
I think they might cook with this one 👀
guys has it always said ps4 at the end of a trailer or does this mean that rivals is coming to ps4 next season
Let's GOOOOOO
Peak cinema, definitely the best trailer so far for a new Rivals season
More healers more thanks pls
The way i have been refreshing my feed is crazy but soooo WORTH IT!! The angel and the devil man lesgoooO!!
Angela definitely a tank thank god
The Devil VS The Angel hits hard!!
Another season coming soon already but the last season is barely even started
Wtf is this
No way we are actually getting Daredevil. This game is so peak
I want a mini campaign against the villains of the season pleaseeee
BARK BARK RUFF RUFF
waw amazing but why is angela so buffed lol? also is it me or could she be a flying hero? also can we maybe see the 1st flying tank? maybe? love the 1 wing only thing
Bro who let them cook this hard!!!😳😲 this trailer was amazing 👏
These trailers get way too good everytime oh lord
Funny thing is, they can make Daredevil into a Mr Fantastic like dps. He should be super durable!
1:17 does one of DD’s abilities mark with blind?
The buff Angela design looks weird. I hope they give us a skinner design.
Daredevil ❤❤❤
Ps4 confirmed also W season.
DAREDEVIL LETS GOOOO!!!!
Please give us shadow land suit and hand of God suit
Another dps?
Gyat damn
Yeah, they gave hints on their abilities in this trailer. Daredevil can make everyone’s screen go dark while he will be able to see you in the fog perfectly, Angela will probably have some type of CC ability which will be really good against divers. Probably a crazy spear throw when she’s in flight, ult might be he widespread blades she shoots out.
Angela looks like a tank. With a spear. Oh no... Orisa joins the battle
Are we gonna get a cartoon or what? These trailers are such a tease with level of animation you guys have.
Well we know who the tank is. Jesus.
Absolute Cinema. Everyone who’s hyped up for this season ✋
Someone make an edit to this, PLS!!!🙏🏼🤩
Magnificent
isnt it season 5?
“Mankind knew it couldn’t change society. So instead of reflecting on themselves, they blamed the beasts.”  *{HEAVEN}* or *[HELL]*
Now that’s an Angel I can worship🙏🏽
Ts an anime fight scene
Oh yay another dps…
Daredevil absolutely aura farming👹
This trailer is so goddamn peak it almost hurts
Wheres jeff dieing
Vanguard Angela WE WON
Literally Goosbumps. Amazing animations 🔥🔥🔥🔥
They asked for a trailer and they gave them a piece of art all of it's own, props to the animators this is some of the best things I've seen in a while
So Hype every season has been amazing so far
More dualists? 🙄
1:08  ✋😐🤚
I'm here for an Angel vs Devil costume theme if that's where we're going with this!
"Player counts are dropping? Heh, release the muscle mommy and badass blind dude" - NetEase
"LET THE DEVIL OUTTTTTT" better be daredevils ult voice line!
WHY DAREDEVIL ARE THE FUCKING SAMURAI????????? what is the problem with giving a character an original recognizable look?
Can't wait to turn off my monitor as Daredevil for that IMMERSION
What are these trailers omg
do not release the girl first again please
A MUSCULAR ANGEL WOMAN?!
Just shut up and take my money
Yay more dps
These guys know how to do a trailer holy...
Daredevil's voice actor is so good in this😍😍
Daredevil never done any of this btw
There’s no way they’re releasing this on PS4. That console’s too old, if they did, it would barely be able to handle it
These reveal trailers get more and more dope!!! The anime style of it all is *chefs kiss*
0:53 Impact Frame Daredevil 😮
If Daredavel will be vanguard it will stain the character. Would be a waste of hero.
They fucking cooked hard with this
PLEASE BE A DOUBLE TANK SEASON NETEASE
So, who will be the main bad guy if Daredevil is playing i that know we get a playing bad guy who was the main bad guy but the one that's we playing as is a copy
This is enough to make me cry 😭
Matt: “…Castle.” Frank: “Murdock...” Peter: “Ooh… are you gonna kiss now?” 😏
add back 4 stacking in ranked or WE aint playing 🫩🥀
FINALLY NO MORE SOLO TANKING!!!
Surely we get iron fist content in a season about iron fist
Ok, but crossprogression?
No, its fine I just didn't think it would be Chinese.
I ain’t never see daredevil move like this
Bro, Daredevil had IMPACT FRAMES!!! MY BOY IS BACK!!!😭😭🫶🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾  His ult line gotta be hard- Angela's too  Best season trailer so far
Oh its fine, I just didn't expect it to be Chinese
Holy peak
Absolute Cinema
Someone do a safety check on all Strategist mains, they're about to reach 6 months without a new hero.
The comments on this trailer are probably going to be an even split between people going crazy over daredevil joining the game and people simping over Angela's design.
I've been addicted to this game since launch... Last game I was truly addicted to was MW2
What happened to captain marvel coming to the game
Can someone explain how dare devil is able to go tor to toe with a very powerful asgaurdian?
bro why gotta be this hard in trailers
The man without fear is finally here 🙌🏾
IS THAT ALEKS LE!?
Oh good I can skip a season
Can we have carnage in season 5? I don’t care if it’s preplanned I just wanna play carnage
1:18 hela even getting into the scrap
THEY PUT THEIR BACK IN THIS ANIMATION OMGGGG
Please vanguards, please vanguards  Please, by the love of God be VANGUARDS!!!!
WE BACK!!!!!!
Anime
1:36 PS4 version confirmed, clearly a stepping stone towards a Switch 2 port (once Nintendo sends them dev kits) as well as better Steam Deck performance.
literally peak 🙏🙏🙏  chat are we so back?
I think this trailer just hinted at both of daredevil’s and Angela’s ultimates. It seems daredevil to blind enemies, limiting their vision and Angela can trapped them in place with her spear.
weaw🙄. fix the god damn matchmaking in RANK.
Hi
OMGMGMGMGMGMGMGMGMGGMGM IM SCREMAINGGG
MOMMY?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
So tired of the venom and Phoenix style skins.  And the dark gloomy maps. We need artwork n more unique maps. The biggest problem is the map pools rn for comp
MAKE THE PENI SKIN A LEGENDARY, THIS IS NOT FAIR TREATMENT OF OUR GIRL. FIRST YOU IGNORE HER IN BALANCE AND BUG FIXES, AND NOW YOU GIVE US AN EPIC AFTER A 5 MONTHS WAIT
The man without fear is HERE!
Angela looks to be a vanguard with a spear that’s very cool
Angela, Blade of Miquella: “Heed my words. I am Angela. Daughter of Odin. And I have never known defeat”
we need an animation show pls
This game on the PS4?
W Animation FR
Seems like a dps and another thick mommy tank, or thick mommy healer, and tank? Honestly thick mommy can be anything really, dare devil I don’t see being healer at all
Please tell me that the first flying Vanguard
😐 who ask for this characaters? You tell me ghost rider, thanos, doctor doom, the xmen, the sentry, juggernaut, gable, the silver surfer, but daredevil and 1 girl that i don't know who is. Game over for me
Absolutely nutty
YOU GUYS CAN'T STOP COOKING!!
This is one HELL...of a powerboost for Daredevil...my guy went from Street tier...to BOXING with NORSE...ANGELS😭🔥🔥🔥
Muscle mommy tank, I think I'm gonna have a new main 😍
Ww
That “LET THE DEVIL OUT” may legitimately be the best voice line in the game…
LET THE DEVIL OUTTTTT!!
So who's the main villain
Marvel Rivals, please let me climb to the peak of Mount Olympus to meet the Twelve Gods. Also, please add Athena to the game — I really like her!
Did daredevil always have those powers? I thought he was street level? Someone explain Please
Angela looks insane!!!! So does Darwdevil!!! Holy cow Ricals is getting better with their character designs. How is that even possible!?
At this point give us a Rivals mini series to watch
angela is so tuff bro
Just take my flarking money already
Finally PS4
Now that it's confirmed for PS4, please tell me this means the game is playable on hard drives. Before this it took like a solid minute to join a match on a HDD.
Daredevil!!!!!🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴
Beleza fera, mai e o deadpool?
Ok, Anglea as a muscle Mommy. There is now way that she is NOT a flying vanguard.
Man Angela is buffed =O
They cooked with this one 🔥🔥
FINALLY HES HERE
"THE DEVIL DOESNT KNEEL BEFORE FALSE ANGELS who let them cook this hard
Yo I just opened up YouTube thinking “man I wish there was some news about rivals s4”  And netease heard my thoughts
Pure art!!
give use like surprise +1 vanguard character colossus, juggernaut ,sand-man or she hulk anything with Angela
OHHH THEY COOKED
Oh my god
FOE THE LOVE OF GOD MAKE DAREDEVIL A VANGUARD
Whatever yall pay the animators and VAs, its not enough JFC 🔥
Tough....
Angels Devils and Dragons  Angela a asguardian angel not Christian angel   Dare devil a Christian/catholic not actually a demon  And dragons because who the f doesn’t love dragons  The dragon city of the immortal iron fist   Got to love this seasons theme
This season is looking to be AMAZING!!
More duelist yep, not installing this game
Man when will I get Gambit
jesus christ
I THINK DAREDEVIL IS VOICED BY ALEX LE
Daredevil throwing hands with Angela is crazy.. 😭
So...does DareDevil have powers now?
ok
Rivals including more impact frames than most animes ✌🏾😭
if we got another 2 dps one season im quit this game
Yay another dps...
god please let daredevil be first im fucking begging you!!!!!!
DEAR GOD😂
Angela is HUGE
Angela looks great! Hope her head isn’t that small though, it looks really bad when she has such a big body.
"Where are my heals"  Whats happening in the backline:
the man without fearrrrr
CINEMA
As much as I'm excited for this season, DD being a vanguard is just not really it. I don't ever see him as a vanguard and the design as well just doesn't fit in my opinion.
i did not understand it but it looks awesome
I swear if we get another dps I SWEAR GUANG IF WE GET ANOTHER DPS
1:17 what is this green?
Oh my God is so real daredevil and Angela awesome dude
Angela?!  if only spawn was here 😔
Crap what if Spawn is going to be in Marvel Rivals?
ALEKS LE AS DAREDEVIL IS FIRE also his line "The Devil doesn't kneel to false Angels" has no right being that hard
Brother, when AM I GETTING DEADPOOL????
DAREDEVIL MY GOAAAATTT
absolute cinema
Miss once I beg you my wallet can't handle it.
No deadpool, but still really excited
Oh my god my glorious king
I NEEEED ANGELA NOW
First of all PLEASE ADD A DAReDEVIL AND PUNISHER TEAM UP and 2 Angela be making me feel a type of way
Confused. Why is Daredevil seemingly a bad guy?
THIS IS SO PEAK😭😭😭
Is my screen just black when I play daredevil?
Absolute cinema.
Teaser ? Nope. Anime dope ? Yeah
goddamn
Play 4 let's go 🎉
ANIMATORS ARE GOING CRAZY
is this not matt murdok????
Angela is definitely a tank based on her character design, and DD is probably a dive DPS
Now that's what I call crazy  Also she reminds me athena
HES HERE HES SO HANDSOME , HES BEAUTIFUL , HES AMAZING , HES AWESOME THANK YOU
a spear, one wing, red hair, one shoulder piece... I NEED HER
Lets fuckin go rivals
This game doesn't get enough credit for its artstyle.
looks FIRE. this is the best trailer yet and these character designs are kiiiiiinda sick guys. well done
Ps4 my friends
BY GOD, MUSCLE MOMMY ANGELA?! Devs keep absolutely COOKING with these designs!
HOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I thought matt was gonna do his hand of God form 😒
Is that Cybrog Franky Daredevil
I really need to look into the lore more...
Cinema 🎥
PLEASE BE DOUBLE VANGUARDS, PLEASE!!!!!!!
“LET THE DEVIL OUT” is now top 5 best ult voice lines in the game
Noooooooo this season could have been perfect if we got marvel Jesus but instead we got bichy gooner bait Why does this game keep adding gooner bait instead of the characters we want
I must not know Daredevil lore that well, because when tf did he get those powers
Daredevil’s VA sounds like Endeavors from My hero i wonder if its him.
THE ANIMATORS ARE POPPING OFF, DID YOU SEE THOSE IMPACT FRAMES
My body is ready
They think they are one piece with these impact frames
DEMOLIDOR BARALHO!
Can't say I'm a fan of Angela's abs but it's a pretty cool trailer and I am excited for Daredevil
PS4!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
🗣📢"LET THE DEVIL OUT!"🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
😮😮😮
OMG
Let’s fucking goooooooooooooooo
un maldito ascenso a los que hicieron esta animacion, 20/10 y GOD.
YES OMG :DDDDD
Please more Strategists!
Angela and Daredevil? Oh, we are back
As a comics enjoyer I did not enjoy this specific design for Daredevil, it's cool as a skin but his character doesn't lean on mentioning he's the devil every 2 seconds neither he has dragon powers, I'm assuming this Daredevil is the iron fist, disappointed.
Another dps 😢  It’s Daredevil 😁
Holy fucking balls, all that revenue from selling Luna Snow summer skin seems to be glowing In this one I hope the season is as peak as it looks
Holy Molly this is incredible 😮😮
0:23 0h... THAT'S DEFINITELY A VANGUARD!
Огонь!
How the PS4 port is possible?
God damn they made Angela so buff I guess she really is beating the duelist allegations
Is it coming out on ps4?? If so thats actually so cool
Amazing trailer
Wish daredevil
What in the anime is this? 🤮
maybe i should become a lawyer
Amazing animation I see the one piece influence with them impact frames… BRING NIGHTCRAWLER NEXT PLEASE THANK YOU DEVS
Blade’s voice sounds spectacular
Ohhh plz tell me daredevils a 5 star
Daredevil would never duck a fade with anyone
DAREDEVIL!!!!!
Angela is trans and Daredevil is an Iron Fist? People are glazing this?
HOLY ANGELA TORSO WTF
DAREDEVIL, MY GOAT!!
"where my heals at"  *DD on the backline letting the devil out
GYAAAD DAYYYYYM, Angela muscles…
So I'm guessing Deadpool will be released during the Anniversary then.
Man, these cinematics are S-rank, animators going hard with each trailer
YEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHH 👊🏾🐉🔥🔥
Forget Emma, Angela is mommy.
ANOTHER MORHERREEERR
Dawg please no more DPS characters
What are they feeding these animators bruh
This needs to be a show, God the animation looking fire😭😭🔥🔥
no support, no tank? the game only has DPS
Yoooo let’s get some Spider-Man buffs going
The animators did their thing with this one! DD is giving off heavy iron fist vibes
Angela and Daredevil LFG!!! Angela better be a Vanguard.
I’m crying we never get another healer again
Love it, amazing, giving 10 where 10 are due! But this is TANK and DPS.... where the support at????
He is coming!👹
So shes a tank right... please say yes Also peak the bottom it says PS4..
I LOVE MARVEL SO MUCH
yo hear me out  dd is gonna be a dive tank like cap
Isn't daredevil gonna be ANOTHER dps????
Angel vs Devil
1:07 HOLY PEAK
Angela looks like to have a vanguard build, and im all here for it as a vanguard main
Angela better be a vanguard
absolute cinema
While Daredevil is probs a dps. At least it's Fecking Daredevil, like come on.
Looks so good!
OMG NETEASE YOU HAVE OUTDONE YOURSELF THIS IS SO FIRE!!!
We need a show asap. These trailers are crazy.
LETS THE DEVIL OUTTTTT
just please tell me they're both not DPS
Ohh.... No Ghostrider..
MY BOY MATT IS HERE
THEY WENT AND GAVE DD A FUCKIN RAGING DEMON I AM CRYING
Whoa this looks amazing
I sense it. A million Reddit tier Muscle Mommy posts.
Muscles
please give us an insane iron fist legendary
I really hope that those magic powers they gave him are just a lore thing and isnt reflected in his kit because that ain't Daredevil if he's got Japanese dragon powers
So looks like another dps
this trailer is absolutely insane this animation??? is absolutely gorgeous?? they went so hard... animators/artist team its banger after banger. please know we appreciate your hard work so much especially at a time when everything can be made "cheap" and "fast" with AI. Nothing beats such stunning human made visuals! Thank you for the treat! so hyped for season 4
IS THE MF DEVIIIIIILLLL NICEEEE, TY FOR EVRYTHING MARVEL RIVALS I LOVE YOU
The Impact Frames legitimately go hard asf. Daredevil looks amazing for this game! 🔥🔥
Dbz type shi
DAREDEVILLLLLLL can’t wait to main him😊😊
ufff but the animator team 🥵🥵
People still play this dead game?
Professor Goo needs to react to this
🔥❤️ Hope Silver Surfer, Sentry, Ghost Rider, Deadpool, Carnage, Toxin, Thanos, Mephisto, Knull, Dormamu, Galactus are all added to the game. Would be cool if I could remove these characters from my roster/game: Galacta, Squirrel Girl, Peni Parker, Luna Snow, Mantis and Jeff. Not into the creepy/degenerate Goon Sack stuff.
Whats a lawyer doing in kun lun
Daredevils Ult voice line should have been "I'M A REALLY GOOD LAWYER!"
It is so fucking peak.
Kun lun resource rumble and convergence is my prediction for the map and gamemodes
Wow 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Best trailer so far. Make Angela buffed even more. And take my money.
The remixed Rivals theme in the background adds so much to the trailer
YESSSSSSSSSS
THIS GAME IS ACTUALLY GAME OF THE YEAR WE ARE EATING EVERY MONTH THANK YOU NETEASE
DAREDEVILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
The blind lawyer going super saiyan is crazy
LETS GO GUANGUANG HAS BLESSED US WITH ANOTHER TANK
I think they are both gonna be tanks
Man, this is incredible. Give us a series with this art style and it would be better than the last 5 years of the MCU.
I remember when she used to hunt hellspawns.
HOLY S*** THIS IS SO HYPE AND THE ANIMATION WAS SO CRISP🔥🔥
Marvel rivals has cooked harder than before
shes a one-winged angel
MA BOY MATT!!!!!!  Oh, I'm gonna main the HELL out of him next next season.
PEAK!!!!
NO HEALER = TRASH
We need series
LOLLL THIS GAME ACTUALLY IS COMING TO PS4
ANIMATORS NEED A RAISE FR!
MY GOAT MATT MURDOCK
Te quiero mucho Marvel Rivals
Bruh What is my lawyer doing??
We got a Daredevil scream!
HOLY HELL ANGELA IS BUILT LIKE A SEMI-TRUCK
LET ME OUT FISK LET ME OUT
A blind dude with good reflexes can now go super Saiyan? Ok, but the animation is amazing
Matt, that shogun outfit isn’t gonna make you a better lawyer.
PLEASE BRING S0 AND S1 BATTLEPASSES BACK!
We've asked for a flying tank and the devs provided. Absolutely peak
"YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WITHOUT FEAR!" 🗣️🗣️🔥🔪
Was that Aleks Lee voicing daredevil???
Guys, Why is Mommy and Daddy Fighting?
Marvel Rivals: Angela is here Me: say less ❤
me: steroid mom isn't real, she can't hurt me rivals:
Massive aura farming
That went HARD!
A FLYING TANK, LFG!!!
DAREDEVIL LOOKS SO DOPE!! BEST TRAILER SO FAR
Net ease actually made a buff woman praise the lord
i thought daredevil was just a guy
THEY. NEVER. STOP. COOKING!!!
Why is Angela a muscle mommy 😭. Ay I'm here for it
Flying tank  I call it 🫡🫡🫡🫡
Both dps pls we don't have enough
Please tell me its not a tank then a dps and still no support characters
Their game isn't perfect by any means but god their animations are top tier!
Habn steifen
The animation team once again locking in hard af with these trailers.  Also that Daredevil design kicks ass icl
Absolute cinema ✋😎🤚
Just make a god damn movie y'all.

LFG, what a cool trailer! Guide will be available on day of release for anyone in need ❤
If she isn't a tank I'm going insane THAT MUST be a tank and if she flies it will be even better 😂
MY BOY IS COMING SOON!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fix the matchmaking, let people create party's or join party's

0:25 my god…

1:30 Bring CYCLOPS to the game
PS4?!?!?!
FIREEEEEEE !
Cool trailer. sad the game tanked so damn hard this season though with its match making. just another overwatch. gets u into the game then rips away anything good
I know Daredevil is most likely a dps but as a vanguard player I can only cope with chunky Matt. Either way this looks so good, haven’t played in a solid month and a half but this may bring me back.
The muscle mommy lovers are eating good this season
W
Daredevil’s voice actor went CRAZY
0:35 DAREDEVIL IS FINALLY COMING!!!
Ima instalock daredevil
Mommy?
Emma can turn herself diamond, but they really had to give angela these ABS to justify her being a tank
It's actually super impressive how quick they can dish out new content

Ah, death by snu snu, great
Most christian  theme inspired heroes(devil and angels) was transformed to represent asian culture subjects))))
I knew it was daredevil from the start. Flame me all you want when I saw the horns in the calling card I knew that was the lawyer himself!!!
Why can't we get a show like this 👌
DAREDEVIL IS FINALLY COMING HOME. THE TRUE FACE OF MARVEL STREET LEVEL!!!!
For those possibly worrying a certain disgraced writer would get royalties to Angela since it was his character, he actually sold the rights to this character to marvel so he's not getting a dime.  Also please Netease give Hulk more skins!
DAREDEVIL LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Holy impact frames
ANOTHER DPS!?
Seems like daredevil and an original character that they talked about didn’t think that would come this early. Unless that’s a marvel character If so no idea who that is.

Guess no new healers this patch
Can we please get something different than Chinese themed characters ? I know it's coming from a Chinese company, but it would be cool to not have so much Chinese influence on every hero
These editors need a raise
Another dps yay
Vanguard mains are eating gooood
Marvel, make an Arcane style series for this game, and my life is yours.
Did Odin only feed Angela and Thor?

Yes omg thank you so much! LET'S GOOO  Edit: now I beg for MCU daredevil skin.. if that skin in the trailer is his default, I dont like it, because its based on season's theme, default skins shouldnt be based on season's theme, I hope this skin is similar to Hela's, only seasonal. I hoped for his default to be based on his original comics:(
Thank God for Rivals for not going out of their way to make female characters look ugly
PLEASE GIVE US A SHOW/MOVIE IN THIS ART STYLE.
I ain't gonna lie I got goosebumps
