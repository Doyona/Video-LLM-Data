Mmmh electroboom danger cookies 🍪🍪🍪🍪 7:49
Its accually a rubber band 🤓🤓🤓🤓 👇 6:51
I think the vacuum helped the arc 4:59
Now its a smoke grenade 4:24
Its a LANTERN 4:23
Is that a real watchable youtube vid? 3:03
Whats ptsd? im just askin 0:03
The gas is probably sulfur hexa fluoride, that gas that makes peoples voices really deep. Thats why fuses in substations can be so tiny. They have extremely high pressure SF6.
😂 0:01
@ElectroBOOM common fuses generally use air* some silica and others hydrogen/argon :)
Hi electricity man 😂😂😂
That “ah” sounded familiar 1:24
4:22 unintentional lightbulb
Make your own wifi box with it and can you make it work
Nasa needs to hire this Mehdi bro
5:49 ☠☠☠☠
This is why you dont use cardboard? 3:40
Then you wouldent be making vids 1:04
Do you mean almost killed you? 1:04
Im surprisaed he actually didnt shock himself this time
3:52 ANGRY FIRE POSSIBLE BAD MAD DOG !!!!
1:20
Bro is straight up making bombs with his videos
من سعودي ويتابع 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
. . .  - - - . . .
Funny man
He tried to shock himself fucking shit
Wires why he using wires fuck him
He does gonna use wire and kill himself. He say fuck you shit. 5:24
I think he tried to burn his house
it hot！！！！ 0:15
I use malwhere
Last year he almost died himself killed😂😂😂😂😂
Sacrifices life for our education😢
Is this guy still alive 😂😂😂😂😂
This guy is immortal 💀💀😭😭
Bro almost made a light bulb🎉
-0:14-- Bro heated a wire even though he have experienced that many times...-
Bro, thought his clap was an arc😂
You mean almost killed me? 1:04
HVF 0:21 0:25 0:25 0:26 0:26 0:26
Thin wire+cardboard+water😂😂😂😂😂
Fuses protect your circuit but NOT your skin...😂
4:24😂😂😂😂😂fireworks 😂😂😂😂😂
I miss my electrican work 😅
Illuminate to fuses… loud to much 😊
It haven't even been 20 sec
This is so funny 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1:04 He has 8 lives now
Bro jumped at his own clap
😂❤
his humor is halirous
Some fuses have silicon sand inside to prevent arcing
man?????
Bro got scared by the future🤣🤣
0:46 0:50 What are those background noises?
You good
😂😂😂😂
Burn
LOL
IH
This guy makes me die of laughter🤣
0:14 that burns and ashes to heat for eletrician to electricity to burnt them to dangerous to fired to voltage of the wires to purpose to arcing approching the the eletricboom video like lightning strike of to burn things them to accident to ash the fire to container of the power outage of electricity
Electro Boom reminds me of Gargamel
The laugh at 5:51 got so hard
What is the difference between amps and volts
This man doesn't need military experience for PTSD,he just needs to do electrical work and experiments
Sulfur Hexafluoride Nitrogen Air Carbon dioxide are good things to put in a fuse as they dont support archs
You're fire alarm hates you so much bro
Y
Should wear goggles for the eslatic band fuse mtals flying everywhere
He said safer disappointingly 😂😂.
Nordvpn doesn't work in iran mehdi
Its that your death? Finally electroboom dies!
Wtf the intro 😂😂
🐰bunnies!🐰
u look like garcamel
Ice Cream Sandwich taught me more about NordVPN then you ever will (no offense)
some fuses like max 250v are mostly just filled with air, but more high voltage fuses are filled with argon or nitrogen or even sand
How bro is not died
He should be electric proof by now
Idiot
1:04 so he does respawn when we arent looking
He has more views than a cat
4:21  bro farted
5:16 it is a light bulb.
8:27 Inducting fuse?
Noooooooooooo more transformers Ppppppplllllllllllsssssssss for your own sake
4:23😳
I feel bad because he keeps hurting yourself😂😂 😂😂😂
Even though I don't know how to speak English, I want you to know that I love your videos and that you made me smile in a very bad moment. I hope you never stop making these videos because thanks to you I am happy.
not even 2 seconds u jump from a short circuit, must be a new record
5:12  When you think about it, thats just a lightbulb for high voltages
0:14 lets not get burned  him 1 sec after saying that: *gets burned*
5:01
I need a new house
in every vedio mehdi bring his transformer
I think it's nitrogen
Look how pristine his hands look 0:27
0:16 you should’ve not done that
Why are creating this for reason and you could die with high voltage
*>:3*
Oh shit *>:[
I like the idea of keeping the fuse wire under tension.  It's almost like you're thinking like a mechanical engineer...
Mehdis electricity bill 999999999+
6:21 Ask Nile Red for it
4:23 Pyrotechnics 😂😂😂❤❤❤im a fan from 🇱🇰
0:01 oh…
BRO AT THE START OF THE VID YIUR ALREADY GETIN PTSD?!
and sir i had a suggestion can try something like that with a transformer present in the phone charger
mehdi i will aqquird the transformer by passing your guidlines just to send it to u so that u can make more content
the spring retracts, pulling the wire away as soon as it becomes moleten enough to break under tension. this stops the wire from slowly drooping and melting, aswell as pulls it out of position quickly.
My favourite teacher
I know microwave transformer wouldn't probably survive that level of voltage, but is it possible to put 2 of them in series to get over 20 kV?
Boom:Let's not get burned  Successfully get's burned 0:15
“One of them has killed me! So don’t try it!!” This is proof that Mehdi is an immortal
i have 2 transformers what should i do with them?
4:22 literaly  made a light source
The sound of his flesh sizzling must be a familiar sound to him
1:22 ElectroBOOM: bLECheuOu
Bro is afraid of current❌ Current is afraid of bro✅
bro got an PTSD of short circuit
3:49 ElectroBOOM.exe has stopped responding.
Bro made a diy light bulb when he put the fuse in that orange bottle
0:15 “lets not get burned” (proceeds to get burned)
3:39 It was at this moment that he knew, he f**ked up. 3:44 Big mistake! 3:49 Mehdi.exe has stopped working
Please, someone stabilize this part on his eyebrows.   3:54
I saw one time a mention of sulfur hexafluoride to avoid arc
At 7:09 the electricity jumps
This guy has more lives than a cat
Plasma : 5:09
you teached electricity skills in another way... THE FUN WAY! (bro have to even sacrifice himself getting stunned with electric and other else to convince us to not do this at home or even without a supervisor)
Not even 20 seconds in and Boom has already burnt himself with a wire
Lets not get burnd tsss AHHH🦅
✨aHhHa✨
8:57 I don’t think it really needs to be a big gap in the first place. Like you said, it can only jump 1mm on its own, so all that matters is that the spring pulls everything apart quickly.  The spring may have just flattened into the metal section rather than evaporated.
I used to not watch your content when I was younger because I never understood what you were saying until now when we are learning about electricity in my college physics
9:02 i like how he has his mouse on top of a fucking transformer
Electroboom am not  Edison 4:18 ;-)
As a quality inspector, I've used (and occasionally still use) Argon gas to conduct air flow testing for syringe needles, backflushes, and related medical devices.
Please just look at 5:50 no questions asked😂
سلطااااااان😂❤
With the fire, will you put it out? You actually can't pull it out with water because it will make the flames worse
Hello, may God always bless you.
4:29 O_O
5:50😂😂😂😂
5:05 Creepy scientist laugh😂
His own clap 😂😂😂
I love when you pull out an old contraption from a previous videos and I’m like « yeah I remember this » it feels like I’m finally up on Medhi’s lore
Hi
Why you did smell-nose from the hands 😂
4:30 what…
5:01 I know you didn’t want to spend time peeling off the wires and gluing new ones in, but did you have to use the wires specifically made to shoot electrons?
•_•
They often use granular quartz in high voltage fuses that blocks an ARC upon the breaking of the element.   The people that made the mother ship for the Apollo missions underestimated the vacuum in space and ARCs occurred from exposed wire insulation which reached the same voltage as the conductors they were surrounding. The only reason a wires insulation works is because it becomes a dielectric and forms a capacitor with the air. That causes the insulating material to ramp in voltage across its thickness. But if you remove the air the insulating material reaches the same voltage as the conductor.
What if you have high pressure air inside the defuse instead of a vacuum ?
4:11 I recognize those plastic bottles! Must be where you store your... Medhi-cation 😉❤
Can you use a higher voltage rated fuse in place of normal?(I know current rating must be same)  Also can't you fill the fuse with oil to stop arcing.
It shit it's self
No one: My teacher yelling at me mid-lesson for no reason at all: 3:50
Você está bem?
Oi
0:14  let’s not get burnt (proceeds to burn himself)
Half the time if I couldn’t find a fuse I used a paper clip 😅😅😅😅😅😅
Do you eat oven parts like cookies???😮😂😅
using a transformer as a mousepad is wild
4:20 4:22
4:30 that face 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fuse sharting out the back 4:25
6:12  So if it doesnt resemble that (your transformer) can i aquire it? say a 60kv polemount transformer.......  hehe going to my local transformer store now (yes i have a local transformer store that regular folk can just buy transformers....)
@7:45 So that's where Mehdi put his spare fuses - into a 👉👉 FUSE BOX  HEHE  *badum tsss*
Dumpling it gone Polly went to the back room
*burns himself and sniff* is killing me😭
Why women live longer then men
If noble Gass in tube, shouldn't it glow near a vandegraph ?
‏😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 ‏‪1:21‬‏
Hes so used to getting shocked that he got scared from clapping
Pftd mean power fuse tranfomer damage 😂
4:23 the bottle farted XD
7:45 Similarly, I get my cookie parts from my oven box.
He's using the Microwave Oven Transformer as a mouse pad 😂 (9:06)
Killed you?
Congrats! It wasn’t a failiure you just made a vacume tube!
9:06 Better fuses have sand on the inside that will fill in the space where the wire is once it melts, they are more effective than the glass fuses, although you need to pull them out and use a multimeter to tell if they've blown instead of inspecting them visually.
9:20 im pretty sure it has dead air in dead air fires get put out instantly
Did you know that your look like mr. Bean
4:24 bro made a thruster 💀
The fuse doesn't have any gas in it but the glass is to protect you and to see when it has blown
Arcs never die. Humans who touch the arc always die
7:22 he actually unplugged a circuit before touching it🎉🎉🎉
7:48 I thought of that was a joke like wait a minute these are cookies if these are the cookies then where are the fuses 😱  😂   Promptly followed by someone eating a bowl of fuses instead of cookies or something😂
0:00 🤣
How tf are u still alive
Electro boom ❎ Electro comedian ✅
I just started the video you only born in your fingers 🤌🏽
See if you can make a 5000 amp fuse
5:00 task failed successfully
0:14 "Lets not get burned" *Proceeds to get burned*
04:50 oh sure a good amount of vacuum
You could use a low voltage incandescent as a fuse
I am convinced that this man has become immune to any type of electricity.
in this video he got burned and melted a couple of fuses plus got some electric shocks
This man has infinite free revives
Browse literally using a dangerous Transformer as a mouse mat
Udaya✌️✌️👍👍🎂🎂💝💝
1:20 so that's why your bald
you help me lurn
You look like the bad guy from Ratatouille.
MEHDI!!! SNAP OUT OF IT!!! THE TREES AREN'T TALKING!!!
4:59 MEGA BRIGHT
4:22 SO BRIGHT
Mehdi: Lets not get burned HOT Live wires: Not today
3:20 any who?
8:45 the spring used instant transmission 🤣🤣
Nah. Bro has ptsd
In some places cookie boxes are known as sewing kits, to Electroboom its oven parts kit.
That is cool
Eye Protection!! 4:22
Not even five seconds in and Electro has already lost it 😂
0:13 "let's not get burned"  (Wire proceeding to melt onto hands) GAAAAH-
Uhh I read in a book that purest form of water(Distilled water)is non conductive. Can we use this for extinguish electrical fires Pls rectify this
5:49 op laugh
if fuses have for example 2 kv rating i could put -3kv cuz it doesn´t say that it has a negative voltage rating, just positive :)
Ok fine yeah I'll subscribe
I think he has a stash of totem of undying so he can get shocked and not die

“I think I’m getting ptsd” 💀
Not sure but I think the metal wire in fuses is made of lead..
3:50 that's why you used soapy water. to wash away the evil spirits from the water that causes electrocution
1:18 That failure make me laugh uncontrollably
This is the reason utility fuses are designed to blow open...
eat electricity
5:50 "HEHEHEUGH👹"
That bluauagh sounded familiar 1:17
THIS  GUY IS BUILT DIFFRENT
9:15 Only mehdi can use a transformer as a mouse pad. 😂😂
hey chat AI. what kind of gas is used in high voltage fuses? "In high voltage fuses, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is commonly used as the insulating and quenching gas. SF6 is highly effective due to its excellent electrical insulating properties and its ability to quickly extinguish electric arcs, making it ideal for applications in high voltage switchgear and fuses "
I got something How to make fire: Battery -  Battery + Put both of them In a battery holder  That connects with a wire
You could also fill the fuse with sand to suppress fire. In Photonicinduction he popped 5000A 600V fuse, there you can see how it looked inside.
Highly volatile and potentially
when did the thumbnail change?
What you have so much Like's
he made a rocket with the plastic bottle
bro trying to kill him selfXD
Thare is a episode on history channel and it says you can store data in quartz and electric y in granite please do a vid on this
3:44 you don't use water on live high voltage😂 🤦‍♀️
5:49 i love the silly giggle here
This is the guy that is a professional electrician but doesn't know how to use electrics. We like to call him the #1 Best Electrician.
Anybody else have that exact same cookie box?
4:21 he made a lamp out of a boytle thing
Where are your safety glasses???!!!
0:01 he thought something exploded
co2
where can you buy such clamps?
7:00 - That's exactly how does high voltage fuses in microwave ovens work. They are a resistive wire coiled into spring with a part straight. When connected, the spring keeps the tension on the wire - when there is overcurrent, wire gets burned throuh, and the spring quickly increase the gap from the initial break to several centimeters DO NOT REPLACE THEM WITH REGULAR FUSES!
5:00 My internal dialogue asked me “wouldn’t putting this in a vacuum just make this a lightbulb with extra steps?”
Cookie box for cookies❌️  Cookie box for electric oven parts✅️ 😃
The fuses are filled with argon gas
It’s not voltage that blows the fuse it’s the amperage.
😂😂🔥🔥
Do you mean almost kill you. 1:03
1:05  did they revive you with the dragon balls or something?
0:01
7:33 the trouble with elastic bands is they dry out and crack. So your product has a short shelf life.
I have a question: since the wire broke broke in the middle does it have something to do with the point of tension. so a stressed metal has higher resistance?
he says that the transformer killed him once, so he's a ghost by lore
This guy is insane like at this part 3:40 that would be so painful
4:55 Making hard x-rays. Yay🎉🎉
Yes there is a gas in fuses, But I don't know what kind of gas. But there is a gas in it, just hit a fuse with a hammer and you will get a very small bang, and that is because of the gas in a fuse ⚡
0:14  "lets not get burned." *gets burned*
9:06 SF6 gas
Why did you put lighter fluid on the box?
I feel like Im going to be a villainous scientist learning from you. Im actually practicing my self satisfactory evil laugh😈 Great stuff!
Pthd
5:49 why is he having fun like a little child while playing with 2000 volts 😂
What happened to b
Grandma: I have sowing needles in my cookie box 👵 ElectroBOOM: I have microwave oven parts in my cookie box ⚡️💥
nice jumpscare warning 3:50
i actully screamed with you i thout the house is sit on fire 1:22
3:52 Mr Bean explaining how to be safe from electrocution
How is he still alive
I LOVE YOUR CHANEL
Yes I’m sure many fuse have gas inside but not sure what type of gas
5:50 goofy is that you
9:05 ... transformer makes for a great mouse pad
NAH HE IS MAD😵‍💫😵‍💫
This electric boom gets shock at the starting of the video😂😂😂😂😂
how is this guy still alive??????
have you ever gone to the hospital due to a electrical mistake
Бьёт током человека а вы смеётесь это не смешно
When he about to make a video   wires: sweating profusely   compositors:also sweating profusely
Wear electrical gloves, as frequent shocks to the body with electricity lead to heart disease whose symptoms may not appear now, but whose symptoms will appear in the future, Electroboom. Adhere to the advice. 😊
Has his house been burn down one time?
some of your electric explosions would be fun for the slowmo guys to film.
Why dont you have Argon? is it... "argon"?   lolol
I'm subscribe ❤❤❤❤😂😂😂
i thinked when you said that was a failure you said dad was a failure
please korean
anyone else thinks he looks like gargamel?
You should try getting a neon sign transformer. From my understanding their current limited and i think there like 6kv or so, Great video as always.
@9:06 Some  high voltage switches filled with sulphur hexafluoride  gas. Probably this fuse also have been filled off with it
??
9:02 - Hi ElectroBoom! Electrical engineer here. We use CO₂ to fill the gas inside those fuses.
775V.ok
4:23  :supera"s been reaall quiet since this dropped
PRoud of youu man ♥
You could be safer12
1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:9:10
0:30
And when opens AAAAAAAAA! 0:15-0:16
5:02 you have effectively made some sort of light bulb.
WARNING! The internet is filled full of these fake 5kv high voltage microwave fuses.   I made a video comparing a real fuse and a fake fuse. My video link is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9PGt4CQYM. This could destroy your microwave, cause a fire, or possibly even explode or electrocute someone.  Looks like you got some work cut out for you ElectroBOOM.
How is he still alive
Dude… DO NOT GET PTSD
9:14
6:37 that made me rolling on the floor
The glass fuse contains no gas
Gargamel

آقا محدی واقعا خسته نباشی من عاشق ویدیو هاتونم 😂❤
Everytime if you scream i laugh assa
you are a hero putting your life in danger for years now to give us the laughs
9:08 are i still using the 12v fan from " fixing my laptop"
no im pretty sure there is no spcial gases in glass fuses
This man makes me laugh and at the same he teaches me science
"I dont have argon..." he says, solemnly.
He got zapped so many times that now his muscle memory got good enough to get zapped on command without electricity lmao
How did you die before
If arcs are easier to achieve in a vacuum, maybe use a vacuum chamber for an upgraded Jacob’s Celebration Ladder? It’s more dangerous than standing near an active volcano though, so that might not be a good idea.
I prefer not to touch that transformer 😵🫥

9:06 very nice mouse pad
"has killed me before" how many times has bro revived😭😭
Use TNT in case of HIGH VOLTAGE! XD
8:47 Did the spring part of the fuse pull the wire to the left end of the fuse cavity? Maybe that's what happened during the first few moments, thus reducing the arc, and then the arc may have just vaporised the rest of the wire.  Would you consider studying the failures of fuses with such high voltage ratings as this with high slow motion?
Love from India ❤🇮🇳
Bet he has ptsd 😂😂
5.51 😂😂😂
A fuse saved my life because I decide to be an idiot and grab this paper clip and I thought it was a blog and then I plugged it in and boom my hands smelled like sausage when it’s cooked
Please make a video on why neutral is connected to ground at the 3-phase  transformers make a practical demonstration on it 🙏🏻
Spam the ten second reverse button.
You clapped and scared yourself… yeah that’s 100% PTSD!  Matter fact, that’s the most PTSD thing I think I’ve ever seen!
Suuuuuuuuuuuuu
I live in Portugal, and here we can still sometimes use a satellite dish. There are not many of them though. Mine is a motorized satellite dish with a Drake receiver. I always wanted to see that device work once again. However, the receiver didn't turn on. After watching this video, I discovered that the old Drake receiver had a safety fuse. It had blown up. Bought another one and it turned on for a brief moment and then the filament blew again. I suspect that something might be wrong with the circuit itself. Or it even might have something to do with the type of fuse. The wire on the original fuse seemed to be thicker.
What about co2?
4:21 bro made a mini flamethrower
This guy has to be immortal 😅
3:11 lol
0:16 /  9:33
Thanks to your videos my dad is now inspired to buy drills and guess what he bought a base of a drill that had a flashlight on the front the whole front thing was a flashlight 😂😂😂
But if the power is turned off, then why not use conductive fire extinguisher?
3:20 did he just said  "Any who "
You need to seal your vacuum White water so Just water seal it
One of what I hate about YouTube is that they always advertise some app.And I hate it because I just wanna watch the video with no advertisements.Maybe you could do that for me and be nice
There would be an inert gas in the fuse like in light bulbs fyi neil red has a science video where he shows this with light bulbs
0:00
get a 0.01mm wire and connect it to a spring that way the copper melts and the spring pulls it backwards but still i love your creativity
film it with super slo mo camera to see the wire break.
He Had PTSD 0:01
hahaha I love this. I'm an electronic tech. This is the sort of stuff I would like to do, if I did not value my life.
6:03 Aaaand that is called welding, kind of.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Everytime electroboom gets electrocuted, a new multiverse spawns from the cosmic event which keeps medi alive in this universe
brother I love your videos you make me laugh and smile.
😅😊
I watch this guy Sense 7 years old
He is going to kill himself
Broo fuse wire is made of 25% Tin and 75% Lead not copper
Don't do this experiment because he has infinity live
0:03 think i'm getting pdst

Whos here in 2024
4:24 that bottle had a Tacobell for sure! 😂
Video Created: WOW GARTEN OF BANBAN 6 IS RELEASED!
5:03 🤨Do you see that? 🤡🤡🤡AHAHAHHAHHHAHHAHAAAH
Oh s&@#
how he is still alive? If i was there, nothing to say :)
I'm not 100% sure but I'm pretty sure the automotive glass fuses don't have any gas. They do sometimes have a bit of sand in them. dang it now I gotta know 🤭
Dude accidentally create a bulb
this guy's amazing in putting in his advertisement's perfectly unnoticable
Not all fuses operate this way.
Look at this nonsense 😂😂😂😂
Anyone want to tell him about pyro-fuses used in EV batteries?
the gas is probably nitrogen
There are safer ways to play with the power of microwave oven transformers. The best one I’ve used is to have the primary connected through a GFCI circuit, then have it go through a momentary foot switch. Keep the foot switch at least 6 feet away from the transformer or enough that if you happened to fall from a standing position you’d still be out of reach of the transformer, then to make arcs just use a chicken stick. The foot switch being 6 feet away ensures that you can’t go touching the circuit without taking your foot off the switch thus disconnecting the circuit.
Very good demonstration
the "sniff test" is how an electrician determines how much flesh was burned.
shittt i am laughing really hard..... you just created an electric rocket accidentaly :D
4:23 HE MADE A LIGHT BULB
I never thought a arc might mitigate a fuse
tesla
Have y’all ever touched the prongs on your charger block and got the piss shocked out of you? My dumb ass has
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Electrocute is so lucky to have this dude as her dad
At electro boom you won't find grandma's sewing kit in the cookie boxes instead you would find grandma's electrician kit to blow up some fuses
So couldn’t you travel through space( which is a full vacuum), with electricity, faster then we could with rockets? If we could only find a way to power that much energy and to protect us/ tools from getting hurt.
Im getting pdst belike:
The gas you're looking for is Sulfur hexaflouride. A hypervalent gas that is extremely resistant to ionisation. It's used in high voltage circuit breakers, contractors and switches. It readily dissolves in nonpolar liquids like those used in highvoltage transformers at substations and the like. It allows for much shorter distances between contacts without arcing.   Basically it's a stable fluorine compound and it doesn't want to give up or accept any electrons to anything so it takes extremely high voltages to initiate and sustain an arc through it.
5:48 this is basically a child with toys
How is this man so smart but so dumb at the same time
0:00 bro fr got ptsd worse tham my grandpa
Fuse - a piece of wire that burns your skin
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
0:20 This definition is right. But for normal use. Not for The Great ElecroBoom guy. Example: Normal use -> 2A -> 50mA Fuse-> open conn -> yey we are safe. Your way of working -> 2000A -> 1A fuse -> still closed conn cos of air resistance -> No one is safe...
3:40
Love how he said its killed him before but hes still alive 😅 wonder if its a miss translation
3:21 to skip sponsor
1:02 wait so who am i watching if electroboom was killed😮😂 How many lifes do you have??
Bro when i always watch this man hi gets hurt
This guy is fucking hilarious
PTSD? From all those sparks and bangs... welcome to the club.
im watching on a Samsung Smart Refridgerator
I suggest to you to use gloves😅😅😅
Bro how far your hair line go back to the end of the world
bros really funny XDDD
I want todo work like this 😢only
Can replace air with sulphur hexafluoride...
3:37 the moment he nearly sets his house on fire and attempts to extinguish the fire using soapy water on live wires
1:21 the moment of silence when he sets his house on fire
9:04 typical medhi, using a HV transformer as a mousepad
Even though I find them fascinating, I’m torn between whether or not I want him to make a video about how defibrillators work.
gargamel is that you??
5:50 that laugh was legendary😂
มึงนั่นแหละที่คนฟังคำของตัวเอง
no don't yes can't
Bro has electrical ptsd
Once when my fuse burned i didn't have any spare one so i just wrapped it in aluminum foil and put it back...
I think im getting PTSD 😐
Can you be so rich to pay his electricity? Bills.
When you see a cookie box you get excited and open it, but, you find needles, that happens in grandma's house. But if you see a cookie box, IN ELECTROBOOMS house, you'll find oven parts.        BTW you're the best electroboom
It’s so funny 🤣 0:35

You actually can use water to put out electrical fires. Deionized water. Many fire extinguishers specifically designed for electrical fires use this.
The only reason he's alive today is those damn fire resistance portions lmao
@ElectroBOOM
0:15 HAAHHAHAHAH
5:11 ok failure yes but being the scientist i am, that looks pretty cool so. were on the path to discovering something on the right direction some how.😂😂
I kinda figured that a 250 volt fuse would have bursted from a high voltage capacitor cause well.......its a HIGH VOLTAGE capacitor well over 250 volts lol heance why the fuse instantly bursted 😂😂😂😂😂
قشنگ معلومه که ایرانی هستی خیلی با عشقی بخدا پاینده باشی 🤟❤️
Buy some gloves my boy
Please make a proton pack
Awesome
You should blow high voltage fuses with the SloMo guys. I bet there's some cool stuff happening.
use nitrogen
I completely forgot about these videos since 2020 and HES STILL ELECTROCUTING HIMSELF you sir deserve a subscribe!
Bro did not focus during the lab safety unit
New fear unlocked
1:21 Lmao see this is why there is Voltage ratings on fuses:):) Seriously thinking 220V fuse will work on 2000V power supply is absolute dumb!! 3:54 But you did:)
I swear, bro has infinite respond

ELECTRO GUY STILL THE BESTTTTTT
To be honest having a science teacher like you would be amazing also a big freaking health hazard but i would love it X)
From the limited research I did, the glass is there to protect the wire, allow for visible inspection and act as a non combustible housing, the gas inside plays little influence from what I’ve read
and one of the has killed me once before. now we know what he realy is
Helium is a noble gas that may work

LOL HE'S BALD
You should use car battery clamps and clamp or weld on copper or other material rods and instead of putting it on a car battery you should use a microwave transformer or other high electricity output and make a taser
Why did you bear current in your every video 😭
فقط لهجه 😂
Chaotic Neutral Electrician
Lets all be honest. Were here for his pain comedy
Maybe I don't realize how many of your video effects are edited and how many are real, but have you ever thought of wearing safety goggles while performing potentially explosive experiments? 😧
How much is your electricity bill?🤔
How we have resolve switching problems , specially DC Arc when we do switch off?  Is there any better idea other than DC breakers and installing capacitors, which should work on both 230V AC and 230V DC power?
Every time he trains against an electricity based enemy.
He’s honestly kind of dumb
Me either I don’t know how this guy has fingers either
Never change Electro, unless it is to become more resistant, then you might become unstoppable.
He got the best 1 Million subscriber video 😂
That fuse costs $47cad the last time I bought one.
4:22 BEHOLD THE UNMACHED POWER OF THE SUN
How do you even have feeling in your hands after all these years of getting shocked?
In the high voltage switches use SF6 gas
"Let's not get burned" The extremely hot wire melts and burns him.
0:03 "I think I'm getting PTSD" Yeah, makes sense
UK plugs use fuses with sand or ceramic in them
Joker's short laugh
I think he’s going insane
Bro really does have ptsd
f
thats it im busting open my microwave, hope my wife doesn't divorce me.
no gas on glass fuse
I like how he takes all mathematics from electrophysics and just takes them completely out of the paper
Fuses show power inside  the glass
aparently there's a thing called a dielectric gas. which is a mix of different gasses, nitrogen, sulfur hexaflouride, etc... with the express purpose of extinguishing arcs.
Mfw he tries to make a fuse and ends up with a crt
"oo lets not get burned" *Gets burned anyways*
For my transformer (4,2kV capable of delivering 3,6A constant) i had homemade glass fuses, but was getting tired of them blowing often due to my experiments, so i made HV breakers. basically a spring loaded knife switch held in place by a piece of metal that gets pulled out of the way by an electromagnet. the trigger is a simple current transformer with some controls (on the primary to not have to work with HV current transformer stuff :) ) That is nice, since now i can just reset them with levers. I also made some risidual current transformers for the "human protection" on 4,2kV but that is a whole other story... By the way, i love your videos! Especially the ones featuring HV stuff
hello Poland 41 zone ;D pozdro
Yo electro boom I work in mills and we pull transformers out like that everyday almost I could get you anything you want basically (preused)
حاج مهدی برا ویدیو هات زیر نویس فارسی بزار ماهم دوست داریم دنبالت کنیم❤
Electroboom making a fuse seems oddly ironic
4:24 Mini pulse jet engine?
looooooooooooool
I love this .. electroboom is awesome 👍😎
I love your techniques and anti-snootyness. Great to learn from. I hope you still teach at uni. EE nerd here. But i work in a less interesting space. automation. not as exciting as arc's and sparks. Love to weld.
Just ran across a couple of shorts. Funny as hell I used to say , any device protected by a fuse will often protect the fuse by blowing up first..............
You need vacuum glass chamber filled with helium or nitrogen so no spring mechanism is needed!!
I have my High school physics finals tomorrow and I am proud to say that you are the one who has taught me most of the concepts. Thank you sir :)
oooooooo
Ahahahahahhaha😂😂😂
"...and one of them has killed me once before..." :D
Then I got the capacitor but the short the life wire then because it EXPLODE AND SHOCK ME FOREVER!!!!!
I got mini transformer
I got lamp s
I absolutely love how Mehdi uses the MOT as a mouse pad. Just brilliant. Protect this man at all costs :)
9:33 Hasn't the spring retracted into the metal end cap?
0:00 Medhi has litteraly been fear condition to loud abrupt noises.

0:25 *sniffs for fire dammage*
Ouch...ouch... Ouch...  I like the explanation but why ouch in every single video
5:50 goofiness
Are you the actor for the smurf movies
If you dissect the remains of the oven fuse, I believe you will find that the spring didn't vaporize, it retracted completely into one end of the fuse assembly  -- that's how much tension it was under.
Nice!
Hey if you ever invent something  As you will just don't make the mathematics too complicated and also make note that it must me taught like this 😢
i have a bunch of those that i could desolder from circuit boards
You know this is the first time I've seen your videos again since God 7 years ago I think roughly. I can remember the electric guitar video and I'm glad you're still in one piece and still making stuff
I am currently doing a thesis on discharges and more specifically on Paschen's law. This empirical law makes it possible to predict the breakdown voltage (the minimum voltage to trigger a discharge) of a gas as a function of different parameters. We usually express the breakdown voltage as a function of the product of the pressure and the distance between the electrodes (p.d). Observations show that the breakdown voltage admits a minimum for a certain value p.d, it is therefore "easy" to trigger arcs. Thus, to maintain this optimal value, when the pressure decreases, the gap must increase, which is why it is possible to make large arcs in partial vacuum.
5:49 the laugh tho
This got must drain electrical attacks
1:07 Confirmed, this man is a undead and that's why he is still be able to do all these after several years experience of shocking himself.
Quick thin fuse wont carry any load
The fact that he is trusting the cardboard 😂😂 The best videos from Mehdi❤
Lets be honest, some of us dont really understand what hes saying, we just here to watch him get shocked and burned 😂😂
The moment he said that was only a 10 ohm resistor in the first experiment I busted out laughing cause I knew what was gonna happen and how intentional it was lolol   And Electroboom made a vacuum tube by accident 😃
Just go down to your local substation and drill into one of the breakers and get some SF6
the fuse with 100 v 6 a can be put to 200 v but then its onli 3 a and sori for mi english am from czech republik
Hv arc in a vacuum? Isn’t that how you make x-rays?
I understand this man than my science teacher!😭😭 But how are you still alive😭
This huy is a govt agent. Working on how to convince people not to experiment electricity in any which way. So that you dont create something that is goimg to change the feul industry.
3:51 my man is staring in to my soul
This is the YouTuber that does dangerous electrical experiments so we don’t have to
f
electro boom is what youtube thinks will happen if you dont say "dont try this at home."
He looks like Gargamel from smurfs
1:22 🤣
Electro, boom, There are special, suits and equipment that you can use
Bro, just has a Deathwish because you’re playing around with white hot metal close your eye level that he has a Deathwish
The guy we didn’t deserve but all needed
👍👍👌👌🧿🧿
9:05 best mouspad ever
Entertaining 😂
This guy is the only person on the planet who can die more than one time...🤣🤣🤣
I’m not trying to be mean, but how are you still alive from that high voltages😂
😂
That laugh bro
Please use transparent glasses to protect your eyes in the experiments.
I guess that noble gas is not suitable for a fuse as it glows and becomes conductive under high voltage.
Even if there was a special gas in the last fuse (the manufactured one), couldn't the evaporated metal provide an electrical path?
Ur job is dangerous

20:00
how are you not dying from that much shocks
4:23 - He didn't make a fuse, he made a light bulb! 🤣
Hello Mehdi! I have a quick eyebrow raiser for you, a video suggestion!  You should make a DIY Faraday cage, the idea is unique I think, haven’t heard a lot of others making one for dispersing electromagnetic fields at home. Also gives a great video for explaining the functions of it for preventing wireless decryption of electronic devices, and also dispertion of electricity!!!  Might not be the most difficult of tasks, but definately a 10-minute video with both educational and fun content.
5:00 Discovering of Electrons by Joseph JJ Thomson  -1897 (colorized)
light bulb 4:23
I noticed that the spring contracts slightly before the microwave's fuse breaks. The frames following that are just a bright light, though, so it's impossible to tell what happened.
I have a question for you sir. I have a 3 phase induction motor . If I reduce the number of turns in induction coil by hand , can I make it run on 220 v instead of 400 v
Bro had that medication bottle READY. I wonder what that medication is for... 0:01
POV speed of light be like: 6:32
Ha ha. He makes a giant lightbulb, making a “fuse” but really he has shown us all that Big Lightbulb screws us all over with purposeful short life spans for profit. Up there with the opioid epidemic and Big Pharma.
Why do people who get electrocuted always have the same face 😭😭
The gas could be from light bulbs
4:45 Well, you basically made a really crappy fusor
All your doing is making a light bulb of sorts. Use a different filament, wala a built they invented them years ago dummy. Voltage is not the problem here it is the amperage trying to go thru the fuse that blows it.

SF6 is used in the electrical industry as a gaseous dielectric medium for high-voltage sulfur hexafluoride circuit breakers. They teach us that in school, all the basic designs for all the ordinary protection (Czech republic).
TLDW (Too long didnt watch): OH SHI-
you should perhaps show how to make a dead man's switch to help people be safe. also you definitely need it😂
Argon and sand.
Future video suggestion: https://youtu.be/lDm00Ww6qE4
Fuses that are used in high voltage power transmission lines quite often contain SF6 (Sulphur hexafluoride). “Because of its unique dielectric properties, electric utilities rely heavily on SF6 in electric power systems for voltage electrical insulation, current interruption, and arc quenching in the transmission and distribution of electricity.” - https://www.epa.gov/eps-partnership/sulfur-hexafluoride-sf6-basics  Thank you for the constant stream of quality content. I always enjoy your videos and you never fail to disappoint!! 👊
last time I worked with 3000V switches , it was very big and had arms coming apart with a blower to flame out arc.  That was for a power supply the size of a car and weighting probably as much as a tank.
3:39
Think I'm getting ptsd (I'm dead 😂😂) . I don't even have 0.69 percent idea what he's saying but the way he says it and everything lovely
5:49 😂
It is really tragic to die during inventing something or get killed by the own invention. But to die during reinventing somthing that has already invented is dumb.  God likes dumb people. I hope he will also protect them.
Wow, I didn’t know mister bean got into electronics!

Dad, why is there a giant capacitor in the cookie box?💀
not filled with gas
normal household cookie box = sewing kits mehdi's house cookie box = electronic components
Hiii I love your videos 😊😊
Keep Mehdi away from outlets. Nah is just to funny to miss. 😅
i think you can find the answer when you try to make a modern fuse. a fuse you can reset
"And one of these has killed me once before..."  I absolutely and TOTALLY believe that. 😆😂😆
I have used 32V automotive fuses for 120 V.  It does tend to crack the glass when they blow.  On the fuse wired that you had the did not burn immediately, if you cut the fuse wire and soldered it together, when the solder melted the wires would separate more quickly.

How is this man not dead
All guys listen please electro boom is dead 😢 its true check on the internet
Make yourself a pedal under your desk that will act as a power switch to, for example, a transformer from a microwave oven
On certain EV cars the high voltage battery has a fuse that looks like it’s insides are made of sand. If you can get your hands on one that would be really interesting.
Try doing slow motion videos
4:19 his reaction was priceless!
Bro never fails to entertain us and at the same time teaching something.

Mehdi is the only teacher, who knows everything but for our teaching purpose he risks his life and sometimes he knows what is going on but acts that he doesn't know anything and acts with us that he is learning with us so that we don't feel bored by watching his educational video. Salute him! He is a true teacher, where we can rely on him and learn from him very easily and he teaches us that even his act, talking, experiment and teaching is getting even more exciting and interesting! He is a true genius! I respect and admire him a lot.

hello sir. I have some questions about the debate you had with professor lewin years ago about wether kvl holds in presene of changing electric fields or not and I would be so pleased if you would answer. the problem i have with your statement is that you have defined potential difference to be what measured by a voltmeter and while that is a good definition for concepts like time and space, but its not so good for potential difference. Now whene there is no changing electric fields, Electric fields are conservative and potential difference is a well defined concept and therefore what voltmeters measure is actually the same as the real definition of potential difference (work per unit charge). But when we do have changing magnetic fields then electric fields are no more conservative therefore work per unit charge on one path will be different than work per unit charge on another path, so I believe it would be absolutely meaningless to define a potential difference between two points.
This guy gives serious gru vibes
You have to worry about X-rays when blasting HV through vacuums, another thing to be careful of! 😁
Your videos are the best performing video, I have never seen it before.  If you do SEO, your videos will reach more people which will increase your income. Do you want to optimize your videos?

Can you please show us how to make a tone generator using a NE555 or NE556 timer?
Hey ElectroBOOM, Do a video on LSM's and LIM's, that would be something interesting to watch, you making a railgu- I mean wait what.
Hi, I'm an appliance technician and I actually spoke with technical support about the fuses. He sent off a request for a part number and while waiting I asked about them. One of the engineers told him they do use a special gas inside the glass tube but he couldn't remember what. I would guess that you were right when you said argon.

Look, I really don't know anything about this stuff. I don't know what you're saying anyway. Even worse, I'm watching it with subtitles. But I'm still having fun, man.
I really love your channel and i srill remember the first videos that i can remember i saw from you. (It was about christmas and i didnt understand english enough but it was beautiful) Please continue your great work and give us more good videos for a long time😊  By the way do you think the shocks may cause some serious damage by accident or bad luck? I remember a class mate who got a shock as a child and had some heartproblems diagnosed shortly after the accident.wouldnt it be better to shock other younger persons (Like linus/ a possible prince/princess Electroboom) in the future to make sure that you'll stay fine?

If this guy stops uploading we know what happened💀
On high voltage like 20kv on distribution line in my country Indonesia (i dont know for other country), it uses Fuse called FCO (Fuse Cut Out), its almost the same with ordinary low voltage fuse but it filled with some kind of sand to prevent arcing inside the ceramic tube. Hope it help your research. 😂😂

Not even 20 seconds into the video and he already burned himself
I'm gonna be real, I don't know anything about this stuff. I have the most basic, smooth brain knowledge I retained from school, but thats it. I'm learning so much from your videos and having fun watching you try some pretty wild ideas. It's amazing what can be done.
How are you still alive after how much you have put your body through
When will he learn not to mess with live circuits
How are u still alive
Bro be safe
He is both sponsored by NordVPN and ExpressVPN
I have a MOT and once I tried to make a Jacob's ladder like his one, but a little better. I too got badly shocked, not because it fell, but because I thought it was off because the indicator light I made failed, and I tried to adjust the leads and it went through my right hand and both of my feet to ground.
Question how are you still alive
5:50
just watch dr.stone you should and the rectifier is needed
Minute 1:25 “AHHHHHHH”
Glad to see you're still kicking. I've been off YouTube for a while so I wasnt sure if your experiments got the last laugh
That's argon
I like your videos i watch you every day
This YouTube channel copy your video and make shots video from your  https://youtube.com/shorts/_XGmWJJsSoc?si=C-61lMi9s-IWpBZN  I just tell you because YouTube need ownership to copyright report

حقیقتا فکر میکردم عرب باشی ولی الان که نگاه میکنم فقط یه ایرانی همچین ویدئو هایی میسازه من مهندسی کامپیوتر میخونم تو قبرس الان ولی از این مدل کارا زیاد کردم قبلا یه پیشنهاد ویدئو هم دارم  که شاید جالب باشه دور سقف قطعات سیم با فاصله های کم اگر بزاری و ولتاژ بالا بهشون بدی (صد ها قطعه ولی با فاصله کم ) ارک خوبی میده دور سقف هم خوشگله هم به پس زمینه چنل میاد یا برای شروع علامت الکترو بوم رو اینجوری درست کنی که کل علامتش پلاسما باشه❤
Dude, you're still going after all these years. Holy shit!
If I'm being honest, dumb people should watch his video to see what happens with f*ck around electricity.
My STEM teacher used to watch your videos before he got arrested for child sexual something. Luckily, he’s in jail right now where he’s supposed to be.

Electro boom is invincible to electricity and radiation
Hi, I am a great fan of your channel. I learned a lot of things.  Thanks a lot man.   I am working on an odd project in which i wanted to calculate my laser engraving machine (DIY) laser head movement.    My thinking is to calculate pulses of x & y stepper driver every fixed interval and calculate its tangent and add up its values till one job completion . As you are an expert of this subject can you suggest to me if it will work or any other method i have to use.
Do you do Standup Comedy? LOL
Could you build a Radio? (Not dying in the aptemt please) we would apreciate it very much

@ElectroBOOM The nozzles used by firemen are actually suitable for fighting "electric fires".  There is a maximum voltage depending on the setting of the nozzle (spray or other) and the distance.  Whatever, the maximum voltage is 10kV and I know a few folks who tried it on a 20kV line and lived to tell but got the shock of thir lives by the resulting specacular arcing.  And even if the nozzle is safe - the result of the use of water iare wet surfaces including the floor, soaked walls and other materials which all may conduct  electricity.  Just a footnote.  For those who are not trained and equipped for this kind of thing.  Keep the f*ck away.  It's better to watch a bad fire than being ...  part of it ;-)
Sulphur hexafluoride
You should _definitely_ do a collab with StyroPyro...

Thank u I learned alot from this always wonder why the fuse from my microwave had a spring to it and I dont know if it was just one of the microwaves but it had a separate fuse that ran from the transformer to the mains
this guy’s electricity bill is insane
4:22 and we turn it on OHSHIII
Can I have a key sight oscilloscope? Also happy new year.
This is what I found. Glass fuse does not contain any gas AFAIK. The glass tube protects the outside environment when the metal inside melts as high temperature can build up. Glass being transparent, helps to visually inspect the fuse to make sure if it is blown.
Are you safe?
Why don’t you use rubber gloves?

Hi ElectricBoom
Thank you for the donation sir
? do science no of this at 4:47, "wire here put it inside our vacuum chamber connect the vacuum pump now hopefully there is some good amount of vacuum and we turn the power" it light bulb with on filament, even arc lights need more than air to make a connection?
Make a follow-up video with more types of materials inside the fuse.
Hi. If its possible, please make a video series to learn electronics, step by step. I know teach electronics in your videos but they are somehow scattered. thank you by the way.
Make your own tupe transistor !!
Yes, fuses do not typically contain noble gases. Noble gases, also known as inert gases, are generally not used in fuses. Instead, fuses employ other materials for their operation, particularly to prevent damage to electrical appliances and avoid the risk of fire 4. While noble gases like helium and argon have various industrial and scientific applications, they are not commonly found in standard fuses. that is the chat GPT answer, yes it has noble gases, you can also buy helium for baloons and use them!
@ElectroBOOM I would love to see a behind-the-scenes long video on the scripting and safety design process of your videos.   Something about your presentation reminds me of good tutors who sometimes demonstrated what not to do and why not, or let students make inconvenient errors as a way of teaching the class why some ways of doing things are unwise. That teaching technique was used in both arts and sciences. If not to be kept behind the stage curtain... is it scripted?

5:02 bro forgot that he already made cathode rays
Idk if medhi will see this but I'm curious. With those fuses being made with a spring, would that affect the circuit's inductance at all?

Best teacher ever . Eyval boom .
I'm an EE and work with 400V regularly. I wanted to see if I could use a 32V automotive fuse to fuse a 400V power line so I put it in series with a 1k power resistor (the fuse was rated for 2A) and a 400V power source. I had the same idea; there's not 32V across the fuse so it should be fine. It exploded in my face. Not really sure why.
Very interesting video, and this case is tragic. I do not normally listen to crime stories, but my feed has shown a lot to me recently, and this one has been the most difficult to hear. By the way Youtube, please quit making these channels censor words. It actually makes them more apparent. It's just lazy moral grandstanding that accomplishes nothing.
Bro's second fuse was a rocet engine 😂
he clicked something at the first two seconds then my RGB in my computer when off into pride colors
Boring. You didn't touch the hot fuse wires to tell us that it is a bad idea...
Now i need the exact same Transformer!
ادمه زرنگ 😂 فارسی حرف بزن منم به فهمم ❤❤ .
I don't know who else to ask but if we built a giant high-tech whistle, an acoustic lens, and then an echo chamber filled with piezoelectric  membranes, each connected to a full bridge rectifier, would that result in a solid state windmill?

From express VPN to Nord von
1:05 ?????
Can you make a laser
Slowmo guy next video idea
Considering how low pressure extended arcs, it would make sense for the fuse to have high pressure inside to shorten the arcs. Not too much so that it isn't explosive, but a few atmospheres might shorten the length of the arc significantly.
Bro's electricity bill must be like 20k lmao
dei like pelo comentario sobre uso de agua no combate a incendios, parabens pelo video, acompanho desde muito tempo atrás.
If you said it killed you then why are you still alive ( 1:39 )
4:50 nice neon bulb!
man so funny😂
Just cheking in if my man's is still alive.
I've seen many of the glass type fuses, have "sand" in them. Is this for T-melt to delay, or for arcbreaking???
"It's already killed me once." Ah, so that's how Electroboom manages to survive so many shocks -- he's using an infinite lives hack.
What about trying to blow the fuse in slow mo to see what happens
I wish you made more videos because they are great! Keep it up!
Fuse wire made up of an alloy of tin and lead
Whats gonna get this guy first? A: Radiation poisoning B: Electricity C: PTSD
If you are executed by electric chair, they would have to double check if he was alive
High voltage circuit breakers at substations often have the contacts in SF6 (sulfur hexafluoride) which quenches arcs. High voltage fuses usually use sand or likely similar gas to quench the arc. There are sophisticated gas monitoring systems to ensure warnings if the gas runs low as if it get critical, the breaker will open while there is still gas available to quench.
Many power companies in the US used spiral shaped copper fuses, encased in glass, filled with carbon tetrachloride to extinguish the arc. Im talking about fuses on the high side of 345KV - 169KV transformers. They were engineered before we realized carbon tet was so hazardous. They switched to solid boric acid fuses encased in ceramic after that.
05:00 bro just made a lamp😂
I worked in the lift/elevator industry for a while. During development we keep blowing expensive fuses so one of the guys who was from Eastern Europe showed us how to make a water fuse. A bit of wire between two screw terminals suspended in a bucket of water. The water cools the wire until it turns to stream around the wire and the wire melts. A small gauge wire could carry 10s of amps. Very cheap and very dangerous.
1:02 this made me “lol out loud”
We use fuses with wire of silver, and filled with sand. When there has been a shortcut, they will often crack open, and be black on the contact points. Also there will be a red tip poling out, marking it as broken. It is used on the power grid, 24KV
Came here from Instagram
Add sand and at least 2 ceramic walls(disk) inside the fuse cilinder.
After two previous videos I've been waiting for the high voltage fuse. And finally it's here! Just use a spring to break an arc!
4:28 твоё лицо, когда перескочил несколько ступеней развития и вместо предохранителя изобрёл жёлтый светодиод и ракету xDDDDD
He knows that the Microwave transformer is not a playing thing to get shock it will suck ur soul 😂 and that's why he never get himself shocked in those videos but in other u know already he does it for us to entertain ❤
Man I was hoping I'd learn about slow blow fuses.
09:09 those small glass and seramic fuses have different delays with different metal types inside, not knowing about if they are air tight
At least someone brings me happiness
5:49 , Lmao
Is it ac or dc ?
Come here not for experiments only for his crazy reaction😂
Yes there is gas inside its the same gas thats in a light bulb
Yes it would have a gas in it.
I had a massive "ooooooooh" moment when i saw the little sping in the fuse
0:01 bro Got traumatised for all these years
A break from his usual video topic "how to be a high voltage fuse"
All the commenters here talking to him like he's not a literal expert. 😂
Triple the length of the pill bottle and use sand instead of gas.
I love your videos!

What are the chances he is dosing himself with x-rays?
actually my grandad was and electrical technician he was working in power plant in czechoslovakia and he shoved me a fuse he made and its as made from compressed wood sheet and thin coper cable he said this type of fuse was used everywhere
How this man still ailve
Just a note at 4:58, if that seal is made of silicone, I would recommend against using that material. It has a very high permeability to air. There are special materials that are meant for use in vacuum seals. Not sure how obtainable they are, but it may be worth looking into. I suspect that would significantly increase the quality of the vacuum. Although it could also be the pump that is the issue.
i need to find out i hev kicked fuck out off lol
Hi f*** edit: @electroboom do you know what magnetic shunts are? if you remove the little blocks of metal between the primary and secondary you will get more power out of the mot, all you need is something to push them out with and a hammer, a flat head screwdriver will work, a metal rod will work, just anything you can hammer them out without damaging the windings
Sometimes I worry that mixing entertainment with safety warnings is a poor idea. StyroPyro somehow has safety warnings that I 100% always believe, I'm not sure why they are effective.
Helium is one gas that is used in fuses, also I think nitrogen
Bro one day you will be killed the second time
Something else came to mind, I loosely remember there being an advert about this switch in the 90s which was poking fun at other brands says something like, 'we've switched the colours because we like to stand out.' I want to say it was one of Gary Linekar's first Walker's adverts and was around bad the time they were getting a lot of stick for most of the bag being just air.
Hi Mehdi. I was watching a video of yours with some students in the lab when our professor walks by and goes, "Oh, that's Mehdi!" Apparently you and Dr. Ali Ghorshi know each other! We were trying to get him to ask you to come down and give a lecture at some point. Or possibly a video lecture. If you could, that would be fantastic!
Damn Mehdi, I remember you not having grey hair; you are like a fine wine: with each new video viewers become more clever & you become even funnier😊😅  Telling you, ‘cause it just BURNS to see you age😰✨
Just asking sir, out of topic.  I'm using opto coupler, is it normal for an opto-coupler to heat up?
send it to tha slomo guys
Bruh invented the light bulb 4:24
I learned more about fuses during this than all of science class wtf
TALK ABOUT CONTACTORS PLEASE
Make a firework out of blowing electric equipment such as capacitors
The lack of safety glasses disturbed me.
Creating a discharge between two electrodes at the lowest possible voltage requires that the paschen condition is satisfied. I believe you can look up paschen curve for air on the internet and set the electrode distance and pressure such that arcs are not produced (atleast until a high enough voltage is applied). Do the calculations according to your design and this might help make better fuses.
Last shot of mouse on the transformer. Good lordy, Medhi.
Bro is Einstiens future
A vacuum could be bad BC it isn't perfect so it is easier for the arc, or am I wrong.
You can also use helium it's also available commercialy
I’m not subscribed to this guy, but I do watch his videos. I will never understand how the hell he’s still alive after all the stupid shit he put himself through lol it amazes me how he’s been through so many near death experiences and the man is still alive and well. I guess him and God are like really close but believer or not I pray for this man every time he makes a damn video like this it’s really interesting how he’s risking his own life to get so many views and subscribers the things that people do for fame
can i install 2 motorcycle batteries on my motorcycle with a 3-way toggle switch to charge which one is switched on? thanks merry christmas
A twist tie acts like a fuse, I did that experiment at home before. LOL!!!
Glass fuses do not contain any gas at all inside of them.
Nitrogen is used for avoiding arcs
👇people who have no idea what he is saying half the time but are just here for the fails
Medhi making an ever escalating amount of electrical fires? Sign me up!
I think there is no gas in that glass tube fuse, but I think this spring is necessary to contract quickly to prevent the continuous arcing.
Bro, how are you still alive??? bro just look at what you we're you doing, like this is crazy man.
Mehdi, my assumption is that the gas in the fuse could be argon or nitrogen. I did want to point out that the spring from the fuse is probably still intact and the fuse blew as it was designed to just not visible from the outside of the tube.  If you notice the gauge of the spring side is thicker therefore giving it more strength in that area. I think it’s great that you showed an example of a modern engineering marvel that is not so obvious to us in other fields. Please make more videos showcasing unique or intelligent design:-) Thank You
3:51 My new GIF material
I just found out that albaniahas no YouTube ads
I was wondering how Mehdi would make fuses a funny subject. This is how, and it's interesting too!  👍
Yes it has some sort of gas
Doesn't that means bulb also work like a fuse?
that microwave oven fuze blew up with a very distinctly blue flash which could indicate Sulfur Hexafluoride but info on the internet is pretty inconclusive
Now I want 5A fuse for 2kV. Provide ideas😂😂😂. Don’t tell me to go and buy in market…😢

I always thought what would superman do if he didn't want to protect the earth. He would be doing electrician like him
Paschen's law is an equation that gives the breakdown voltage, that is, the voltage necessary to start a discharge or electric arc, between two electrodes in a gas as a function of pressure and gap length.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paschen%27s_law

He already died once?  How did he come back?
@electroboom try to put distilled warer inside the fuse 😉

I’ve got a glass fuse filled with a liquid gold in colour rates for 6500v
Finally❤ he posted videoooooooooo😂😂😂😂😂
Reminds me of that big mf Fuse that Chris Boden had to replace in a Hydro Electric plant: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YIFXLP_5_tk
Good demo, Most HV fuses in ring main units (RMU's) have fine sand in them. The fuse element(s) are wrapped around a ceramic former and an explosive discharge which operates a striker pin at the fuse cap and trips the tripping mechanism, after the fuse element has failed, so all three phases are de-energized when one fuse fails. DDO's drop out fuses, the fuse element is held under tension by a spring which aids the separation of the melted fuse element. Also the tube vents out and blows out the remains of the failed fuse when the very loud explosion occurs under fault conditions.
@electricboom Sf6 is good to extinguish arc

Why is it when he is telling us about turning off the power before putting it out he looks like a Timelapse
It all makes sense why fuses are designed with respect to what the voltage of the circuit is to be protected without arcing.
How loudspeaker works. How loudspeaker manufactured. How can a manufacturer say this speaker is a 4 ohms 20 watts. What science behind in it. How they make the speak to operate specific frequency and how magnetic flux influence in it. Make a video of it. Please 🙏.

"I put my oven parts into the cookie box" - that killed me and I had to pause the video :))))
can you make a more useless video ?
Normally a fuse is not gas tight. The metal caps are lose and not sealed and the glass tube is open on both sides. Dunno how it is with the hv fuse though...
How kind of Mehdi doing the wrong things so we can all learn together
I have some 20kv fuses from our old electrical installation at work, if you want to make retro-ingeneering with ... the only con it is in france, if you have some holidays here you can ask me to give it to you ;)
So if I put a spring fuse on my head during a storm, will it protect me in the event of a lightning strike?

Normalize using a transformer as a mouse pad
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_hexafluoride this one gas may be used in the high voltage fuses
7:13 like, i know mehdi isn't *that* careless to not disconnect the power from the transformer but i cant help but think back to the jacob's ladder incident
I remember another YouTuber was testing a massive fuse. And the inside of it was packed with sand.
Nord isn't working in iran anymore
damn you're still alive
I learned something this morning! Yay!
Listen to the beautyful hymn of death by X ray charles.
It burns burns burns the thing of wire the thing of wire
That fuse looks like an inductor which is opposes higher frequencies like higher arcs..   Grabbing the high voltages and storing it like a magnetic field …
I'm sure he was using a urine cup in the beginning of the show.
Hi everyone, I want to know how to connect the wire to the ground? Must connect it to earth or is there another way?
wow your my hero i love your videos keep them up from kii

Hold up it killed him before wait what
Were the conditions in the partial vacuum experiment suitable for x-ray emissions?
The Microwave Transformer returns.
Você não era assim...
Water doesn't create shorts, water is not conductive. Ions dissolved in water are conductive but even then it's not the water itself that conducts.
You are missing the obvious of filling the fuse container with a non conductive powdered solid such as sand.
4:23 bro created a light bulb

That's another use for a bottle XD i made a weed pipe out of one of mine 😂
Do NOT play with the heating element. It will burn you no matter what.

Is that a microwave battery?
Him: "it's very dangerous and it's killed me before." Me : how did you respawn from dead again? 😅😅😅
In Power Systems, Circuit Breakers generally use air blasting to extinguish the HV arc, there are other methods as well, like resistance switching, SF6 gas, chopping the arc...but spring works as well XD
Your works are gets weak
Hello Mehdi. Is it possible to get shocked because of increased solar activity? I've been living the same house about 6 years now and never had static electricity issue before and literally nothing was changed during that time. However, I notice that about two weeks ago I started to get shocked by my front door handle and water tap and my Apple Watch charger, basically anything connected to the ground of my apartment.  I also found it interesting that static electricity and solar activity are peaked during the last 2 weeks in Google searches.  Do you think both are connected somehow?
I found this video about how to make an.......AC Current detector..? https://www.youtube.com/shorts/DJIcT_EqtSM
Hehe huooh
He should make a video about how to decide when to use fuses inside circuits, ive seen lots of them in low power circuits, my bet is they are near diodes and stuff that usualy becomes a short when they die.  Or now that he made a video about fuses, what about one for breakers?
I know how this man will die but not when
the only way to learn, is to fail as much as possible. at the end, you always win!
I just realized why I love ElectroBOOM so much. It is the perfect intersection of two loves: the 90's sitcom Home Improvement, and engineering.  Medhi is just a much smarter, Iranian-Canadian Tim Allen. "More power!"
5:02 The relationship between pressure, gap length and breakdown voltage for electric arc is actually quite interesting and it's formulated in Paschen's law (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paschen%27s_law ). When the pressure is too low, there are not enough gas molecules to ionize and make an arc. On the other hand, when pressure is too high, electrons have too many collisions with molecules and they're losing too much energy to maintain an arc. So partial air vacuum was an optimal condition, as we have seen on the video. Thanks @ElectroBOOM for showing that!
داخل فیوزهای کاردی سه فاز یه لایه نازک فلز کاملا صاف و کشیده شده هست که برای جلوگیری از آرک دورش یه چیزایی مثل ذرات شن یا نمک پر شده.
This is great❤
I haven't watched this guy in years, is he still blowing himself up with tesla coils and shit? lol
Plz try to make a "Super Copacitor Plane" (video on Youtube by Tom Stanton, he's prety cool)
You should try to get a lineman fuse they use for high voltage lines also need ear plugs if you get to blow the fuse
using mechanics to solve an electric problem. xD dont make fun of mechanical engineers from now on xD
ElectrBOOM combines education with fun - and we love it.
I just realized after watching a video from 10 yrs ago from Medhi he still looks the same apart from going bald😂
"This one killed me once before" had me dead xD
Okay do you guys know who is gargamel
at lower pressure arcs jump further on higher pressure it's difficult to ionise the air and that's why sold barriers work better than gaps
6:22 sulfur hexafluoride is what is used in a lot of high-voltage electrical equipment as an arc suppressant.  its also like the opposite of helium (if you breathe it in, it stays there and makes your voice a lot deeper, but don't try this since it stays there and can asphyxiate you if you are not careful).  ive seen warnings about it on the doors of some rooms with electrical equipment around where i live.
How many times do you get shocked???
This fuse has Argon, u were right. HT systems have fuses with sand fillers or even ceramic. The material is a special combination of Manganese, Cobalt, Nickel etc.
Also some glass fuses for purely hobby purposes can be repaired - using super fine wire - they are usually soldered to the end caps - they blow just as fast - the ceramic fuses are more robust and filled with silica like mentioned on this post before - using the wrong fuse is very interesting - and the reason for protective heat-Shrink or a plastic enclosure is probably protection against fragmentation of the case  - I had a non - repaired standard fuse I used on a HV project that literally exploded into pieces…
his videos make me feel like he is already dead and all these videos were scheduled
Thanks. I always wondered about that.
7:55 Cookie box filled with tools and components and stuff you might need one day. That was a staple of any good homestead back in the 80s. 😅

4:23 Rocket Fuse!!
i want a cool mouspad what is better than a high voltage trans
They fill fuses with hydrogen and O2.
You look Like MrBean
Thank you for this. I've designed a few 15kV and 27kV fuses. If you can film at 20k fps the arc formation an extinguish looks cool.
Can u make a video using an alternator to generate ac current
4:20 my guy build a rocket engine
Happy birthday ElectroBOOM
Touch heat into wire melted 0:11
There's a noticeable increase in insanity in this video
You could have placed your fuse in the fields of your tesla coil! Maybe the color of glow could help you find out which gas is in there!
4:18 "And we turn it on oh SH**"
These sponsorships are killing you.
"One of these transformers has killed me once before!" Oh man... you came back from the black mountain? Did you see the Koala? What did it say?? Was it smiling??? O_O
He's so funny 😂
That’s the most epic YouTube still I’ve ever seen.  Badass!!!
How is this guy still alive?
Time to take my microwave apart
When i close my eyes and hear your voice. I see Gru.
My TIG welder seams to arc just fine with Argon shielding gas 🤷🏻‍♂️
HRC fuses came to mind. Surround the thin wire with sand and you're on your way.
I hate shorts, YT pushed the short but never told me about the video.
There's a special gas inside
6:36  He was more surprised it worked and he didn't get hurt.
Fuses are for amps, not volts.
Video starts: Hi F***  Me: we meet again bald man
Great video
Great video
we need this with a a slow mo guys colab!!!
Yes, there is a non-conductive gas inside the fuse. Also the function of the spring is not to pull the piece of wire that melts. creates a path with resistance to limit the 2.1kilo volts, also at a certain moment you see that the fuse illuminates for 3 or 1 seconds, which would be the gas igniting       I hope to win a heart from electroboom lel
Thanks god you cane back again from along time
I did actually accuired a similar transformer before that Jacob's ladder accident😅 I like it so mich, i used only controlled voltage and current while playing with it though 😁
Ive been your subscriber since 2018 and im proud to say you showed me what i liked, your videos connected me to electrical engineering which is now my profession. Im currently working at the Gas Compression Site as an Electrical Engineer. Thank you Mehdi! I was enjoying your videos so much and im still enjoying it! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. You are the reason of who i am right now!
I cannot figure out how this guy is still alive
Hi Mehdi, I guess they fill the fuse with heavy gas called SF6, that type of gas is used on power distribution station to provide a high voltage isolation , below more details about that gas  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_hexafluoride
هرکس هست سلام
Also, this guy is slowly reinventing the lightbulb. Anybody else notice this? (Vacuum, noble gas, glass enclosure? Hmm? HMMMM!?)
I almost died beacuse i put a light bulb on 4000w and i still fell the pain of the melted iron
We definitely don't want Mehdi to die. Again.
bro has ptsd from the start of the video.
How many times dose this guy keep burning,zapping,tazing his hands or knee
This guy lives in Vancouver and I saw him once not far from my house, he was busy so I didn’t ask him to photo with him.  Im from Russia and live in Canada, for me seeing the western youtuber is quite rare event, plus he is the only one who Id like to take photos with and respect for bringing knowledge and joy

یلدا مبارک :D
I'm unsubscribing because of NordVPN. I love your videos. I hate that company.
hi you are always the best. Shouldn't you be wearing sunglasses? those arches are full of ultraviolets... or not?
Well make an slow motion video of this fuse
How nice it would have been if we had a slow motion video of that 5000Volts fuse blowing...
Im old enough to have replaced alot of glass auto fuses and I'm 99% sure there is no special gas .. some are not even sealed all that great
Thank you for your service
😂😂😂
U make iron welding machine😂
Need cody's lab to answer this question! 6:10
5:49 his laughing 😂😂😂😅😂😅😂😅
Awesome funny illustration. Let's see the reusable smart version of a fuse recreated in your lab. :D With a switch, I mean.
Next video 📷 on : resonance!
8:58 if you use nitrogen to fill the fuse tube it will work because nitrogen act as noble gas under normal atmospheric condition, that's why nitrogen is used in the filament bulbs because it will prevent the oxidation
Meanwhile express VPN; *cries in data*.
definitely everything is like 20 times more funny when you don't understand anything lmao
دمت گرم  افتخار میکنم که هموطن من هستی❤
I think for April Fools, you need to do a cover of Danger, Danger, High Voltage.
High voltage will kill you and not a joke. The transformer you are playing with is not a toy
Inspired from you i try to rectify the fake content and try to explain the fact , to reduce the junk. Thank you Mehdi for such videos.😊
Челентано ебанулся и создаёт высоковольтные предохранители
"one of them has killed me once before" me : huh?
Please explain high voltage stepdown transformer fuse
I've always wondered about those expensive ceramic fuses in multimeters. Maybe they're sand filled? Do they do that for the voltage rating?
Wow
10 seconds into the video I’m already hitting the like button
1:05 wait, so is cannon that you resurrected?
Instine from wish😂
Thank god for tinfoil otherwise I'd go broke buying fuses
Nice, a classic-style ElectroBOOM video, keep it up Mehdi ❤
9:24  THE OUTRO we expected 😊
You are like the fun father I never had
1:25 POV: you understand what you did wrong in your exam after getting it back (you still failed)
EB  sniffs steam decks ...likely
Makes me think of those power line fuses with the explosive charge that goes off to force the circuit open.
4:58 if you knew not to shake this so the filament stays intact, you're old
At least he is still with us
"mind the ratings, or else.. bang budubu bang bang bang"
Kumar
Please add Persian subtitles
Bro had them Vietnam flashbacks 💀
This man taught me way more then my school did in 2 years!
4:25 Man, you just invent gas breaker. Ark inside the volume make gas to heat up and increase the volume, gas push the electrode out and after that expanding gas blow the arc. At the same time the fuse electrode jump out from the housing, extend the arc way, this prolong the arc. This two methods are used in combination in industrial air circuit breakers. Congratulations 😅😅😅
What if I use a 5000 volt fuse for my 12v car battery? You did not cover that possibility. I think "mind the voltage rating" is only important if your voltage is higher than the rating.
In the words of William Osman, "welcome to the world of high voltage, where everything is a wire and you're probably going to die."
You never cease to make me laugh!! Happy holidays ElectoBOOM! Stay safe...
I need gifs of the intro with special effects... brb
how about a NH3GG 500A Fuse. 😅 Try this.
This guy made me go into electronics
I would love to see you tackle DC fuses. They arc for much longer because the voltage is never zero as it is in AC
How many times can Mehdi die?
I Luv the Wording in the NordVPN Ad. I remember when they changed "safe sex" with a condom to "safer sex." Remember kids, the internet, and prostitutes, have incurable Viruses. PSA concluded.
yay im here early
0:10 Its a piss of wire
EB: "Alright, we all know what a fuse is" Me, nerviously: "Haha. y-yeahhhh!"
عالی شده ، خوب شد برگشتی به سبک قدیمیت
Welders have better transformers.....
We need a high speed recording played on slow speed to see that fuse go :)
THIS DUDE IS BURNING HIMSELF FOR VIEWS
Huzzah! Another entry into my life making me wish I was Tesla.
DISCLAIMER: Just don't do anything like I do.
Try suspending the fuse in [non-conducting] mineral oil.   No more arcing. They often use oil like products for switch gear at sub-stations.
It would be so awesome if you included slow-motion of the "accidents". Like the slomo guys
love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🤎❤️🤎
😢😢😢আবার অনেক দিন পরে
That video brings back memories of one of my most dangerous creations, the 4 microwave oven transformer series-parallel supply that runs from 220V and produces something like 4kV at 1A. The scariest thing is that high voltage windings are tied to the iron core of the transformer, meaning there's 2kV live on the transformers themselves.
When working with arcs, I Highly recommend wearing eye protection !
Cookies go in oven. Not the other way around.
Use sand 🏜️
Found this  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuse_(electrical)#:~:text=Large power fuses use fusible,evolve large volumes of gases.
That was kind of a weak watered-down version of what I have come to expect from you.  And haven't we really saw enough of that transformer you took out of a microwave.  Maybe if you were to get your hands on a welder and take the transformer out of it and do some experiments with it than perhaps that might just bring back the fun and excitement people like me have come to expect and enjoying seeing you partake in.
7:47... oh come on... its either real cookies or sewing stuff ^^
The answer to the question, do high voltage fuses contain special gases. Is yes and no. Some fuses do contain special gases, and some don't. I would suspect that the fuses inside inexpensive microwaves likely don't contain any special gases. Often the conductors inside of the fuse bodies are specially formulated so that when they vaporize they create special gases that have an arc quenching effect, but they are not all built that way. Fuses are made with many voltage, current, energy and time ratings, so you have understand the circuit that you are trying to protect, before you can specify the right fuse. Like you said; only replace opened fuses with new fuses with the same ratings.
One of the only YouTubers to have not fallen off. I don't see it happening any time soon as well
That was so sad when Electroboom died
Electroboom, at 7:18 you really should be wearing eye protection.  Molten metal travelling at high speeds is really bad for eyes.
its sad that he is getting older and older until he needs to stop posting :(
Man, you need the slow motion guys again! Then we can see if the spring is having an effect.
Good to see you again Mehdi
Hd
I'm just here for the thick Persian accent
Did you... Make a high voltage gun at 7:30, shooting high voltage electrodes around?
Yes, they do jazz too.
Electroboom needs to watch some of bobsdecline's videos about fuses for 7200 volt systems.
Sir i have one question.... how do you still have hair on your arms.....😮
any talk of fuses anymore just reminds me of the louis rossmann vid where he shows that the fuse is the last thing to burn out in a macbook circuit
Fuses do have a maximum turn off current up to which they can reliably cut the circuit. Above that the plasma arc can continue the current flow at least for some time.
We need another LATITY episode
Paschen's law might give you the answer for your "vacuum" fuse behaviour. Mobility of free electrons is increased under lower pressure and thus the arcing distance is increased. In addition your chamber was filled with vaporized metal after the fuse burned off...
Can you do a video on the high voltage  pendulum
I would love to see a video from you about vacuum tubes used in old radios and some instrument amplifiers. I have always wondered how/why those work.
Sounds like NordVPN is the one that is going to steal my data
Your videos taught me more about electricity than my school physics book and your videos are actually fun!!
You need to get a neon sign transformer.  They're by no means "safe", but they're less deadly than a microwave oven transformer.  Voltages are available between 3kv and 15kv, and usual current limiting is 30ma.
If you look closely to the footage, the spring retracted into the fuse body
About the gas - I remember that in high voltage switches there is usually an SF6 gas around the contacts, which has extremely high resistance to prevent arcing
1:04 He was probably given a senzu bean XD
HE IS STILL ALIVE!     6:19 Argon is my favorite element btw
Nord VPN is trash . Don't use it
Ahh yes but I have done this but at 14 I am now 26 and I am surprised that I did not get electrocuted
this is learn and fun at its maxium expression
Also, isn't it technically the power that heats the wire, not the current?  So, a 10 A automotive fuse should blow at 120 W, which means only a 1 A draw on household 120 V electricity (ignoring variance and the differences between fusing AC and DC power sources for the sake of illustration). Since Missy applications work on a fixed voltage or nearly so, and because higher voltage includes the risk of arcing, it's easier just to have separate voltage and current ratings, so you get the right voltage for your system and the right current for the specific circuit.
7:29 should have been "arc-some"
Sometimes even non-conductive extinguishers can lead to electric discharge on the skin. I had that experience with the next situation - 150 kV, 100 kHz with a CO2 extinguisher. I catch the surface discharge on me via the CO2 to the air. Luckily the current was low and with a high frequency.
The spring fuse might just have regular air in it. Didn't you just say the typical arcing distance for that voltage is 1mm in air? Also, I bet if you took it apart you could find the spring part hidden behind the metal. You could see it before it popped because it was stretched under tension.
5:50 HEHEHE HUUUGH
Another video. Keep up Mehdi!
سلام مثل همیشه ، عالی 🧿🎖
The more warnings you add, the more attractive it becomes to ignore them. :)
Am I the only onw who thinks he looks like Garry Kasparov 😂
9:46 I don't think the spring got vaporized. I think it collapsed back (like it was intended to to extinguish the spark) into the metal cap end on the screen left.  If you watch right when you turn it on, you can see it moving to the left slightly
Wait, never thought I'd see a day when Medhi uttered the words "there  was no huge arcs either. AWESOME!!"  🤔😂
there's no gas in fuses, most of them aren't sealed
😂😂😂 the intro! Kudos on making it this long before getting some PTSD aroused and shocks. Lol😂
One normally puts cookies to bake in the oven. ElectroBOOM puts the broken oven in the cookie box 🤣🤣🤣

If 3000 volts can jump a long distance in a partial vacuum, and only just a milimeter at atmospheric pressure. Then how much distance can it jump if stored under 5 atmospheres of pressure?  Pure nitrogen has a higher resistance to break down under pressure.  Search "paschen's law Wikipedia" or paschen's curve
Magneto ignition units on aircraft engines (piston engines) for high altitude aircraft, something primarily used before the advent of the jet engine, generally pressurized the magneto from the compressor feeding air to the engine, to increase the breakdown voltage.
They're filled with Hydrogen. Try it
I always wondered what the difference was in voltage ratings. Makes sense though. I guess a 250 volt fuse would work just fine in place of 600 volt until it blew. Then ypu may have a problem. To be clear im not advocating for that practice. Im just stating i always wondered what the difference was between a 40 amp 250v vs 40 amp 600v other than the size. 40 amp is 40 amp but it makes sense to me now why they are different.
That is how mean free path comes into picture
Electroboom is back❤
you should smell the gass to know what gass  it is
6:50 that contraption looks like it took you an hour to set up. Can't imagine how you'd get the rubber bands on the string without breaking it 😅
AC fusing is also different from DC fusing, as low frequency AC self extinguishes easier, but DC and high frequency is different, DC sustains better, and RF ionizes better
You should have tiny fire extinguisher on your desk that is working
In parcial vacuum that was just a sort of light bulb :D
Should use salt as it wont melt to glass if arc would be big
Please donate me an oscilloscope?
Needs a Slomo guys colab.
Not enough boom in electro. Maybe next fuse will be bomb fuse?
Bro got 300k view on 22 hour
ElectoBoom has 9 lives like a kitty cat 😼
The guy who actated as a fuse in almost every video of his now building a fuse for safety 😂 ...nice video though ❤
Use it outside the rating and then...we'll know the 'tolerance margin' (%error¿).  #Beware of the most lethal 'discovery'.
You can use a spectrometer to determine what gas is in that microwave fuse based on the color of the flash of ionized gas
Here's an idea, attach a lamp to the same circuit as the transformer, so you have some way to know when it's on

1:04 man I'm dying every time I see that clip.
Strangely relevant to the last rocket labs failure, where low pressure in space (who'd a thunk) caused arcing in the second stage PSU, and a failure to reach orbit. It's a little more complex, but awesome that they could diagnose it after the fact. Now they pressurise the PSU to stop that failure mode.
Looking at the colour of the dishcharge, it could be pure nitrogen. I also know that xenon lamps doesn't like to maintain an arc, which is why we used to make the flash bulb in old cameras put of it. So it could be xenon, although xenon doesn't give off a violet flash. Something to do with pressure and ionisation, the gas needs to be ionised to become conductive, the discharge occurs, this increases the pressure inside which raises the resistance until the arc stops.
We need a crossover with slo-mo guys now...
How about lighting up noble gas with something like a tesla coil to check it's presence in a bulb or fuse?
@ElectroBOOM Can you explain a Magnifying Transmitter to us Pls??? It was an invention from Tesla.
Note: the song "O Tannenbaum" (The Song of Iowa) was played in 0:04-0:08
fuses seem like a good subject for another Slo Mo Guys collaboration
Probably argon in the fuse tube. Its a noble gas
lots of love from INDIA

1:04 - how about you make a video on how to use transformers safely? I mean eventually someone's gonna use them, even if you say no, so maybe just in case they decide to use these, they will atleast know what NOT TO DO so it's less likely they will die.
Would a gfi protect you with the transformer? Not looking to try just wondering if it would work.
thank you @electroboom for making knowledge about electricity more reachable to everyone. you are doing good work
Please do something on the drop fuses used in high voltage. They're pretty interesting, and it's really hard to find anything that properly explains their function.
It may be sulfur hexaflouride. You know, that gas that make your voice really deep.
i subed and jained today⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡
Boom
Sir why don't you make a new high voltage supply
7:50 I was expecting sewing stuff in that box
"Today we will create a fuse" *it did not work* "Let's try it in vacuum" *Now it's a discharge lamp*
5:07 Didn't you just make a load of X-Rays... (High Voltage between a cathode and anode in a vacuum)
"Let's not get burned."  Proceeds to immediately get burned 🤣
There's no gas in those high voltage fuses. I'm soldering them and they still work like brand new ones
At 7:10 his extention cord sparked
Back again
The way that arc under partial vacuum made me giggle makes me realize I am not human.
Arcing in a partial vacuum is a very interesting phenomenon. It recently caused the loss of a Rocket Labs vehicle. High voltage from the fuel pump batteries caused arcing, destroying the electronics. This would have been impossible under normal atmospheric pressure.
Now to test that fuse with >5kV to see what happens... 😏
That was cool in the vacuum.
YES , NEON GAS ARE USED FOR FILLING THE FUSES INSIDE ,CAN I GET A HEART?
trees growing too close to the powerlines causing excessive load on the generator station via passive accumulation of electrostatic transfer... no, they just come over to property to paint mark trees as a joke to, cutting that guys branches off of all industrial connections. going back to the housing standard of 1803... if their even was one... ... ... as the ants come marching in one by one, song of Russian origin just as almost all Christmas carols are. songs nun hears, the cannon like blast of a 800kv disconnect switch. why need that much... the other guys pool heater, 😐 i have 3 lagoons.
your supposed to stay calm with fire
Mehdi's Law: V = F * I  Where: V = maximum allowed voltage F = tension force I = maximum current  NB: This is science fiction! Do not implement in real life unless you are Mehdi
ElectroBoom Never Disappoints Us! ❤
Many high voltage facilities work with noble gases like sulfur hexaflourid. But you can also insulate the gap and thus interrupt the arc by filling the fuse with sand. Sand-filled fuses were pretty much the standard for decades in households before switch fuses became a thing.
Free Palestine
pachen minima for the win
Close the medicine box and seal it without air coming into it and supply voltage and make a light bulb
your mousepad at the end is awesome haha
Bro used soap water for demonstration 03:43
Check put the fuses used in the space station. On esrth fuses work because gravity pulls down the molton metal. In space, that molten wire will happily conduct in place.
Julian Assange is probably feeling something like PTSD too. Please free Julian Assange. The English government is hiding details from the world. Please help as a noticeable person on the internet. One man's freedom today. Next , YouTube censorship.
Then a halogen bulb can be a fuse
His eyebrows are also shorted circuits😂
Very interesting. Thank you.
These videos are great! Aside from learning about how circuits work, I also learn how dangerous they can be. This is very helpful for when I'm making my own circuits. Thanks!
I'm not sure I remember it right, but in underground HV Transmission Lines we were using SF6 gas . ( I checked Michael Moorrees's comment below and I was remembering it right)
He finally created a 2nd Sun..... By accident
Good to know that you are still alive😅
6:00 yeah dont worry i only have 8 of them😳
lol, I have the same cookie box, also full of random electronic doodads
You are the best
yeah dont worry, out of all the channels i want to replicate yours electroBOOM will never be on that list 🤣
Wait so can we make a jacobs ladder in 50% vaccum?
4:33 forbidden vape
5:05 thats the most manic laugh ive ever heard XD
- funny, first principles breaker design...
now horror movies is not scary than these videos
Make a light bulb
Excellent video. Now can you explain how fault current ratings work? A fuse has rated voltage, current and fault current. EG I'm using some 25A 1000VDC 50kA fuses (Littelfuse SPF if you really want to know). Blows at 25A, can stop a 1000V arc and can handle a potential 50kA fault. I don't understand why fault current rating is needed as well as voltage rating?
HRC fuse use Sulpher Hexafluoride gas.
Did someone noticed the very cool looking mousepad He used at the end?
Congratulations on getting the NordVPN endorsement! Love your channel!👍
If that's a 5000 V fuse why did it blow at 2000 V? I assume amps were also higher
how did it kill you when you are alive now?
I like it how you say "DON'T USE MICROWAVE TRANSFORMERS!" then you proceed to use it as a mouse pad. Epic!
Beautiful explanation. Filming a fuse melting with a slow-motion camera would be even more exciting though. It can be shocking how slow-mo videos can reach arcross a wider audience :)
"...I keep my microwaves parts in my cookie box...."
Mehdi you should get a high voltage/high current PSU operating at much higher frequencies, to avoid electrocution. I don't like watching you sitting near and holding MOT wires close to your body.
Can you do a hpsv lamp
I think i have idea why electroboom didnt die yet,He Is dead already
Lesson of the day: Do what Mehdi says not what he does =))))))))))
When Mehdi explicitly says about something dangerous: don't - the child in me automatically wakes up and says: do it!
Your mouse paid is amazing 😂😂
molten metal will permanently disfigure you. I watched the first 15 seconds and stated this for safety reasons.
Thanks!
So true about springs in HV fuses. Fuses used in the transmission lines *are* spring loaded, inside a cylinder filled with glass-sand, which melts during a short.
now you need to make a follow up to cover interrupting ratings.
Can we get electoboom on a WIRED video about electricity?? That would be awesome 🤣
Voltage rating on the fuse is the maximum voltage. You can use a higher rated fuse on a lower voltage but that might not be economical.
its a good day when electroboom uploads a video
4:10 Putting it on a cardboard box wasnt a good idea either
1:06 'one of them has killed me before'  LOL
Yes there is a non conductive gas in the fuse. Lol
Mehdi please explain how a fbr works
Wow, I think about 20% of this video was sponsor plug only. I mean I get the sponsors importance, but was really long for such a short vid.
didn't you create x-rays in a vacuum? 5:02
What we did in the ham world was take a big plexiglass cylinder with a thin wire running through it, then fill the whole thing with sand.   The wire would turn into plasma and the sand around it would collapse and break the plasma arc.
Why does it sound like he's in hell when he talks seriously
love from jodhpur INDIA
Ive been watching this dude seens the beggining of his channel and I learned somethings
if atmospheric pressure decreases the distance an arc can travel, could possibly a high pressure environment inside the glass tube be advantageous to extinguish arcs faster than normal atmospheric conditions?
Why would I get a transformer? I can watch you do it instead, from the safety of my toilet seat.
Pressurized gas and/or sulfur hexaflouride in the tube.
Fuse plug 250 v 13 Amps
bro open the fuse from the microwave, the spring in still in there it didnt disappear!!!! its inside the metal part.
Haha, i loved when camera followed Mehdis eyebrow
I like how he used the transformer as a mouse pad
Every time I see you taking out the microwave transformer, I worry for you. Please be safe.   It's a pity you didn't mention other ways of extinguishing the arc, such as filling with sand, extinguishing baffles in reusable automatic fuses or at least the division of fuses into ac and dc ones.
a wire inside a glass container filled with a noble gas. Sounds like a lightbulb to me.
most of the time... like 98% of the time whatever will go wrong... will and the fuse will be intact. Story of my life.
He has 9 lives
Today I learned something new from your video. Thank you.
Woah he survived again....
A cheaper option than Argon could be nitrogen gas; it might still ionise into nitric oxide in these kind of conditions though
What's bros electric bill each month 💀
As a former pharmacist going into engineering, I approve of this use of pill bottles Finally a use for the old ones
killed me once before......care to elaborate?
1000
Im never seen fuse protect circuit
I was thinking that you should fill your container with sand to surround the fuse wire, but I guess that doesn't work so well on video for entertainment value. I thought that was what is used in a lot of higher energy cartridge fuses.
My heart can't take these videos. 😄
1:07 I knew it, you're a series of clones!!!!
Compressed gas conducts less. Specifically if inert
bring back bezan-likeo :c
Should have test 8x250V fuses in series too..
WHERE DID EXPRESSVPN GO !
Love when he uses his transformer as a mousepad. 😂 Classic.
Please use safety glasses around open blowing fuses. I had an open fuse blow on me and I found a spec of molten metal embedded in my glasses.
Hiiiiiii
Hi Mehdi what is the progress of your outlet installation in your toilet/bathroom ?
Is it the current or power (V I) that blows the fuse? Is a 12v 5 amp fuse same as 120v 5 amp fuse?
3:48 mehdi trying to realize what just happened
9:10 GOD DAMN THAT'S A DEADLY MOUSE PAD!
I know you are dumb on purpose Mehdi but pretty much all fuses are spring loaded in some way. Even the 220 V fuses, except the wire is also the spring. It's under tension even when it gets red hot. So should it melt, it "pings" off into whatever direction still has the most tension. That is how you can see it's broken as you have a small bead of molten wire with a decent gap between it and the other side. It doesn't just droop away and fall to the side of the tube.  Car fuses make that squiggly path as that path is the spring. It's thicker than the actual fuse part and so when it blows, the thin wire separates reliably because the thicker part is holding it under tension. Might even be some material science involved where the hotter the thick section gets, the more it pulls the thinner section apart.  And fuses that can be reset are essentially just material science, they are resettable because they don't actually break. They just get hotter and so they bend apart and they need to cool down again before being able to make contact, which they of course don't do automatically as that would be deadly. But should some genius fix the lever in place, they still just bend apart and once they cool they MIGHT (if bad design) make contact again. But they won't stay in contact if there is a short circuit.
5:11 isn't this how you make X-rays? lol
That fuse blowing might look cool in slo mo. Better call Gav and Dan back.
the spring in the microwave fuse didn't melt, it retracted back inside the metal end so it looked like it disappeared.
Лучшие уроки по изучению английского языка!))
Electrical people are so lucky to have him. Anyone know any youtuber for mechanical stuffs like he do?
My guess would be Argon gas in the fuses to replace the oxygen. Less chance of a flame / expansion of gas / mini explosion braking the glass. It also would provide a higher level of accuracy
Instead of gas , u can use sand
I’m the 97Xth commenter!
Mehdi: well, that was a failure *laughs maniacally*
Medium-voltage fuses may have liquid-filled envelopes to assist in the extinguishing of the arc. (I got this from Google of course)
Sulfur hexafluoride gas, known as SF6, is nowadays used in high voltage gear to prevent arcing.
Only Electroboom would suggest you scan their sponsor 😂😂😂 I love this channel
Hi
Too late, I already have some high voltage transformers. They are of various types. Just in my cars, I have 14.
Argon would make the arc worse.  Believe me. I'm a welder. Most probably the original filament inside a fuse is of a conductive material, or covered in something that would prevent any arcs.
WWWWWW
Why does the arc start jumping at a longer distance under vacuum? Doesnt the breakdown voltage increase as the vacuum becomes stronger?
Fuses are Open Circuits
I do not understand how this guy is still alive XD
This bottle of drug is more consistent than his videos ...
I bet these experiments generate a lot of refuse😊
I saw some Day Such braker with a fine sand instead of some springs etc
I was filled with dread watching you use both hands to handle the high voltage wires. You only need to forget to turn the power off once to become dead. In the future please keep one hand behind your back. I don't want to lose you. I need a sedative now.
7:46 I have that same cookie box to keep my electrical equipment in.
anybody else here think ElectroBoom is a missing Howard brother, the one that got an electrical degree?  also, I think we should all appreciate that he still has all 5 fingers on both hands...
It's also not "just" wire that is used in fuses. Usually it's a softer metal with a specific melting point.
Probably argon in the fuse
Can you make a crystal radio and explain how it works and demonstrate??????
😂😂😂😂
Danger, danger ! High Voltage !
ElectroBoom your pill bottle may not make a high voltage fuse but you make a plasma rocket…😂! Have a great day!
@4:29 should have been the thumbnail. 🤣
Wait he got a new transformer?
This is not the real Medhi, this is his backup body in case he dies. The original Medhi got electrocuted in the Jacob's Ladder video.
In high voltage power system we use "SF6" gas as an arc quenching medium for some of our circuit breakers.
6.5 minutes and i am out
The spring didn't vaporize in the industrial fuse.  You can see 2 frames where it is contracting, _before_ the bright flash.  At the end, the very tip of the spring is just visible from the left housing.  There is a cavity where the entire spring fits when not extended.  This is why the left (spring) side of the fuse is slightly longer than the right.
1:03 One of them has... killed you once before?  What, uh... what are you not telling us, Mehdi?
He refused to stop building a fuse.
At our powerplant, the fuses to the generator PT’s are around 2-2 1/2’ long. 22kv gen before it hits the step-up GSU. Makes sense why they’re so big now
😂😂😂😂
You could basically construct your own fuse that's the same as HRC fuses by using a ceramic tube sourced from the electronic bay website and sand from the local hardware store. Making metal end caps like a normal fuse would probably be more difficult, but for experimentation purposes you could just solder the fuse wire to some leads (solid wire) and epoxy them into the ends of the tube.
Maybe the gas is sulfurhexaflouride. It's used in HV relays.
0:09  1:19 3:33 😆😆
Great content!  I'm 100% sure this mans death will be from electrocution, sadly.
What now? You betraying ExpressVPN?
playing around with microwave transformers is too dangerous for yall. if you get touched by that you have a 70% chance of dying.
🤣
Thank you for explaining the reason for the voltage rating.
TLDR: Old school pennies work great as fire starting fuse replacements!
use magnetic fields to suppress the arcs.
If you got to 0.25 speed you can see the spring pull back enough to kill the arc just before it eradicated
how did I know that was a electric fire? lol
Or Else
hey Mehdi, i think its about time you start using a spring loaded foot pedal switch for sending power to your circuits. Might cut down on the fire risks. When you start to panic you can just lift your foot to cut power. Warning: may result in a lower view count
Bro, He Looks like the Villain from Smurf
I somehow read "Making high voltage free"
@5:00 ElectroBOOM reinvents the incandescent light-bulb ;)
5:00 @Rocketlab needed to see this a few months ago. 😢
6:38 When you get the question right after you just guessed
Hallo Electro Boom, ich freue mich jedes Mal über deine Videos. Es gibt auch noch die Möglichkeit den lichtbogen mit Sand zu löschen in diesem Fall sind diese glasröhrchen mit einem feinen Silikat Sand gefüllt. Dieser feine Sand sorgt dafür dass der Kanal durch den der Strom fließt schnellstmöglich gestoppt wird.
i hope you enjoy a happy holiday season, mehdi! 😊 love from the sunny okanagan!
I want more experiments with fuse and maybe fuse that protects something from melting
Please make a video of Joule Thief for Step Up booster
Him missing up then stares on my soul and starts insulting me 😭💀
1:03 "One of them has killed me once before". That can't be true. Are you sure only once?
And if I use it UNDER the nominal voltage? 🤔
Sand?
LOL, Elecroboom "don't want to be spied on, USE NORD VPN which reads your emails to warn you of suspicious links"
eye protection man , eye protection !
I have already acquired something that resembles that.
Yes, please give NordVPN your internet data, your passwords and access to all of your devices. 🙂
Hi there, @ElectroBoom! Hoping you visit the Philippines soon in your videos! Mabuhay!
It's crazy how good this dude is at demonstrating useful information in a comedic and ridiculous manner
Mehdi will never die, he'll just keep re-spawning to the nearest spawn point.
"Let's not get burnt" *Immediately gets burned*
I'm more concerned with the concept that Mehdi has died at least once. How many lives does he still have left?
Can you just put multiple fuses in serial to handle the high voltage?
The steve irwin of electronics
4:23  Once he is finished cooming, he wakes up and it takes a second to recover, den the fire hazard goes away.
5:48 omfg he's literally Homer Simpson HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
likely just nitrogen in the fuse bottle.   you need to get a PPE sponsor.  Noble gasses are conductive and you should know that when you definitely played with neon bulbs before and likely now that welders use argon as a shielding gas because it is conductive. Welding only happens at low voltage (around 70 - 4 V) and high amperage (between 40 and 200 A although there are some that exceed 1000 A in thick boat hull fabrication) in order to melt 2 or more metals together.
5:18 Not a faillure at all. You discovered a new light creation device. You should name it ; " the electric sun " . Or since it was so bright " the bright light " ... Or " the arc flash light "..
Electroboom: Let's not get burned.  Hot wire: Are you sure about that?
The Tommy Cooper of Electricity. Phenomenal! Thank you for the videos : )
maybe CO2? easy to get and cheap. Like from Spain!
Why not just encase the wire in dry sand?
In the semiconductor industry we use SF6 or Sulfur Hexaflouride to prevent arcing in certain areas.
Since you promote the Nvpn services, and since you seem to be a person we can trust, can someone make you accountable / responsible for any possible misadventures that could happen, with the service you promote?  Can a client put the blame on the person who convinced him to buy ?
1:26 I love how your acted "AHA"-moment exactly mirrored my own genuine "AHA"-moment. Great presentation.
Medhi is an absolute trooper. He came back from the dead after being killed by a transformer to warn all of us about transformers. I salute you, sir!
Nice
WHY ARE WE SHOUTING
I like your SUPERHIGHVOLTAJE Mouse pad.
The spring tension in the wire worked! Just as you demonstrated with the elastic. The arc from the fuse traveled from the right to the left, starting on the thin side. Once it separated on the right, spring tension took over.
mehdi got more hair?
This guy should be a boss in Borderlands
As a electrical engineer ye and no some fuses have argon some has asbestos it depends on ratings
I love this rediscovery of fusing and arc arresting from first principles by just trying stuff and then fixing each problem as it happens
I can't believe so many companies have stolen the idea for Mehdi's "fuse" device, as he calls it, and have given him zero credit. Disgusting.
How’d the arc burn to your eyes go in the morning?
Why this video was too short :(
I think they use a special metal for the wire of the fuse, and no special gaz in the glass. Or maybe argon idk
Could the spring act as an inductance when shorted making the rise in current slow down?
Every True RMS good multimeter that isn't the cheapest garbage has at least one fuse that is filled with sand.
9:03 Why in the world are you using the transformer as a mousepad?!
4:23 Electric ⚡️ orange capsule  5:02 Big electrifying invention 8:33 the final product
I don't like the new style. It's too calm. I know that this is technically more genuine, but I liked the staged (or were they?) fails and all the screaming and cussing 😅
Wait a sec.. I already have one in junk box somewhere. Something in the 25-40kv range. It is about the size of a pringles can plus the bracket. I think it resets. It never made it on ebay. I used it as a doorstop.
As an electronics technician I've had to explain several times that it is OK to use a 250V fuse even if the original was 125V.  The rating is simply the maximum hold open voltage.  The current rating is the important bit.  So in Europe, you would NOT want to use a 125V fuse since mains voltage is 220.
A plastic cup with sand
please dont become like linus...:) just wanted to say..also, nord vpn blocked conservative website, they love to censor people, so nooo thnx, but like your videos, hope you dont become like linus, with his destroying upcoming small businesses
fuse go bang
Had many a "you are using a vpn" warning from sites  So is the "you can watch content from other countries" really an honest selling point?
I wonder how many money he has from advirtisment
Ask AI for some video ideas! I love your vids!
If you with your mouth confesses that Jesus is Lord & dead for are sins, and in your heart believe that God raised him from the died, then you will be saved.
Neon sign transformers are great.
Wait wait he just said the fire was contained in the med bottle?!? Did you not see that jet of fire 🔥 shoot out??? That didn’t look contained to me 😂
6:15 you'd be making something along the lines of a neon tube
9:10 nice mousepad…
I've already done some arcs with a MOT before! 😂😂😂
I think this is a sign we need a electroboom - slomo guys fuse burning vid.
Legend is back ❤
Maybe if we used some kind of non conductive noble gas, like Argon💡
Yes Completely Eradicated that fuse... :)
Love your videos!!  You inspired me to create my own channel to learn and teach more about electronics. Thank you.
7:13 Edison fuses in a nutshell
The fuse the one thing electroboom refuses to use lol
For those are interested, the phenomenon where its easier to short gaps under partial vacuum is called paschens law.
When you made the arc in the vacuum chamber I was like, "Is this man going to pull out some argon?" but then you were like, "I don't have any argon," and I was sad.
I expected a fuse/braker you could turn back on
POST MORE
I just replaced a 1000V 200A fuse at the trolley barn because someone pulled a stupid.  It had a ceramic shell and some sort of white powder inside.  The short was so dramatic that the ceramic case broke.  I don't know if it had a spring.  Maybe the white powder extinguishes the arc.
after some light research, boric acid is good with plain ol air, when the boric acid evaporates it puts out the arc through some science hippy mumbo jumbo
Sir i am very disappointed with this video. I have not seen a single autobot or decepticon in your video about Transformers, shame on you.
medhi you observed that air causes resistance, so try a non conductive noble gas, im thinking argon but im only half baked and did not research, however im hekka nerdy so theres that
You never disappoint.
https://youtu.be/WVDQEoe6ZWY
People need to stop saying that you can watch shows in other countries via VPN. All the big networks detect and block VPNs these days, including Nord. I notice Nord is changing to a security app instead, and I don't need the password manager, and certainly don't want it scanning and checking my links via its own server!! Kind defeats the whole idea of using a VPN!!!
that derp laugh when you were playing with the arc is so gonna be a meme
now explain breakers, please!!
@ 5:48 you never go full retard, unless you are having fun lmao
"let's not get burned" *gets burned immediately after*
My first thought when he said “put two nails on a cardboard box” was that he would end up setting it on fire and sure enough.
at 0:14 Medhi sniffs his burnt skin, i do this too and sometimes i think i smell delicious, what are your thoughts mr unibrowboomer
Did he say "Pizdez" @5:01??!
1:04 "And one of them killed me once before" Mehdi got 9 lifes lol
seeing mehdi progress, from not really balding to balding white hair.... he needs to be charged again !
Argon would create even longer arcs. Trust me 😸 They use SF₆ (sulfur hexafluoride) for proper arc extinguishing.
I'd say that you can fill these with argon, since argon is also used as fire suppressant.
I can’t wait to get a cookie box full of microwave parts
2:31 لحجه اصیل ایرانی😂❤
Transformer mousepad
Maybe you should use SF6 Gas.
Do you have AED on hand? And somebody who would like to use it on you in case of RUHA (Rapid Unscheduled Heart Attack)?
Please be careful. I just had my first aid training and the instructor warned us because of electricity because if you get shocked (even with technically low voltage) and also f.e. animal fences, you might have really dangerous damages in your body which you might even notice after hours or maybe days...
It's not PTSD. It's just you subconciously getting worried that the fun and small shocks that you look forward to and secretly enjoy are getting less fullfilling forcing you to stray to the dangerzone for the thrill and buzz you crave so deeply.
That litter, they look like afterburner
In France, we have sand in some fuses because when the wires melt, they're hot so the sand melt into glass and glass isolates the circuit. And if there is more arcs, then more heat is created so more sans is melted to glass that results in more insulation.
Don't forget the difference between AC and DC voltage ratings. The latter is usually much lower.
Love your Videos. Keep up the good work.
I love this chanel
NordVPN!!! What happened to ExpressVPN, you traitor?!?!?!
This is WAY over due..
Now after 50 years I find out why the air force had 32 volt, 125 volt and 250 volt fuses with the same size and amperage. Thank you.
The Electroboom don't kill yourself challenge (99.99% impossible)
7:13 I panicked and hoped that you turned off the power here
Maybe next video you can try to make a super powerful burning omega ultra laser.Or P.B.O.U.L
There are fuses with sand inside especially for DC applications for prevent a DC arc keep going after the fuse blows.  When the fuse blows the sand moves into the gap and in the worst case because of the heat transforms into glass acting as in insulator
@ElectroBOOM The breakdown voltage in any gas follows a Paschen curve. While extremely good vacuum (< 10^-3 Torr) greatly increases the breakdown voltage and prevents arcs, the breakdown voltage actually initially decreases compared to atmospheric pressure until it reaches a minimum around 1-10 Torr, which depending on your vacuum system could well be the regime you are in especially with non rotary vane pumps. The is because the ionised charge carriers smash into less atoms at lower voltages because there is less gas overall, meaning the charges can make it further distances and hence sustain the arc over longer distances. However at some point you start decreasing the number of atoms that can ionise and carry the arc and further reduction of the pressure reduces it even further, which is why the breakdown voltage eventually starts increasing again.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paschen%27s_law
channel soon to change name to "Oh, sh..." 😂
Its nice how he starts the video as like a caveman knowing nothing on the subject and, as the experiment progresses, he finds out how things works ... that's actually how I like to learn, start from nothing and try to re-do what the guy that discorver did..   Well, I'm assuming he knows things works before hand, so he is guiding us thru the path... or he actually don't know and it just coincidence.. 😅😅.. well, we will never know..
Please do not scam people with VPN scam ads. Thumb down.
You know what you are doing, being an EE. I was seriously nervous with the rubber band HV fuse and no eye protection. Random blob of melted wire flying into your eye, no good.
Aw you don't have any argon? Damn I was hoping you'd make a neon light.
Slowmo guys! Id like to see that last fuse pop. Please come in.
Sulfer hexaflouride might be in the fuse
You know what's gonna happen, I can see it now, you won't die getting electrocuted, you're gonna get a horrible burn and it's gonna get infected and you'll keep over from the infection. Please wear gloves when handling heat hazards. Burns are very bad, you can keep bare handing electronics tho
Happy holidays everyone ^^
Don’t touch the MOT!
you should look into systems used to close circuits under very high voltage. it needs to be very quick to reduce arcs, so it's quite interesting
,,one of them killed me once before "😂
I know the University of Kentucky operates a large Van de Graaff generator (as a particle accelerator, the original purpose of the VdG generator) and to reach the highest voltages (7MV) they pressurize the unit with a mixture of carbon dioxide and sulfur hexafluoride.
What about distilled water for extinguishing?
Mehdi using 2000V transformer as a mouse pad. Gold.
what's his electricity bill
Anything can be a fuse, if your current is high enough  - Sun Tzu, probably
They might put SF6 gas in the fuse like they do in HV circuit breakers to extinguish the arc.
I am a Power Systems engineer at a bio-industrial company. SF6 gas filled equipment is prominent in industry. We use it for most of our HV switchgear.
Who thinks Mehdi should see a therapist about his PTSD?😂😂
It looks to me liek the spring retracted into the metal sleeve on the fuse, as the burnt end on the spring side is centered and noton an edge as you would expect from the coil of the spring.
Not positive but I think argon is conductive. It’s used as a shielding gas for tig welding. Maybe just argon plasma is conductive but for high voltage I don’t think it would work.
fuse gas 😛
Look how insanely smart is it done in Tesla inverter when you need to interrupt high current at high voltage. Instead of using very expensive and large fuse (with e.g. 900V, 500A), you can use pyrofuse to destroy thick copper bus bar and safely hide oncoming high voltage spark inside high voltage fuse rated for minimal current (1A). https://youtu.be/WNNhWYogBe4?si=Gcw_dlhExcbFdea_&t=451 (7:30)
Mehdi please stream againn😢😢😢😢
"one of them has killed me once before" 😂
Thanks my friend💥
Safest mouse pad ever
...I love you Mr. Bean. (...for all of us that had Teddy bears named Teddy.) ...,.,...
Just taking the fuse apart and looking at the solution would have been much more boring, thank you for taking us on this journey of discovery :)
Your warning that occurred around minute one;  thank you. Your delivery and production of stuff is brilliant.
There might be sulfur hexafluoride inside the fuse, the gas is used in some circuit breakers intended to "quench arcs".  What I do know is that the gas is ~6 times denser than normal air.
That fire trick was "just a bit" rigged. :DDD
Как же я обожаю такое объяснение физики! I so love physics explaining like yours! Thanks a lot!
6:19 no. You’d want to use nitrogen. Noble gases ionize pretty easily under high voltage. So hilariously enough air is probably the best gas for this application.
I've watched so much Electroboom over the years, I already know something will go wrong well before it happens, and it's super funny 😆
Well, very low and very high air pressure can make it harder for electrons to jump across andmake an arch between cathode and anode plates
0:14 ElectroBoom: “let’s not get burned..” **Immediately gets burned**
r6 gas
The reaction occuring in vacuum sounds pretty logical as air permittivity is different than the vacuum's and coulomb's law...
I think the bigger breakers / fuses around use sulphur hexafluoride, explosively deployed, to separate the contacts, and extinguish any arcs.
Mehdi is like a Mexican family's dog, been through everything but will die of old age and not high voltage
Hmm... I think Mehdi has been having fun with his new Tech Upgraded setup... the editing is funnier and more crispy :D
w vid
Mehdi made 7:20 Basic switchfuse with that elastic band. We have those where I work, the fuse operates a Stricker pin which hits a trip bad and opens the switch. Isolating the fault.
Missed you man
the intro AD was a free energy scam Mahdi WTF
Zionism is Fascism 🇵🇸 freedom for Palestine
to extinguish plasma they normaly use special sand u should try that
4:24 this is a farting fuse...
Quick PSA - I know you know, but others may not: These Microwave oven transformers are EXTREMELY dangerous due to the high voltage, current and frequency involved and accidents with them/touching them will be really painful and very likely fatal. Even if you think you know what you are doing or if you actually know, DON'T mess or experiment with these things or even try to get one, which can also be dangerous. These things have killed a lot of people. Accidents can and will happen and your life definetely isn't worth it.
Plasma scientist here: Using noble gases would not work, as they are easier to ignite a plasma in (this is due to energy losses in molecular gases like N2 and O2. Keyword rotational and vibrational excitation). What you would want to use is an electronegative gas like SF6. The electronegativity essentially sucks away all the electrons, making it harder to ignite a plasma.  Also, going to a high vacuum and below would also increase the ignition voltage again. The lowest ignition voltage is (depending in the gap size) around 1 to 100 Pa, which is probably near what your setup can achieve. For these high vacuums you would need much more expensive turbomolecular pumps to lower the pressure even further. If you are interested, you can look up "Paschen Curves". Thats the relationship between the ignition voltage and the product of pressure and gap size Have a good one!
1:03  One of them killed me before? What?
Why dont they use simple automotive fuses in microwaves tho?
1 second ago No views No comments No likes I'm first
Breakdown voltage decreases at first, as you lower pressure.  You need less than about 0.3 Torr (.0058 psi) before the breakdown voltage rises high enough that you are less likely to arc than in atmospheric pressure (760 Torr).  It's not likely your home vacuum chamber can attain that. (See: Paschen's Law)
Some fuse also contains salt. I dont know the reason .😢
The reason why the arc was bigger in partial vacuum is because air conductivity has a maximum at about 10mbar, to then drop below conductivity at standard pressure. In detector applications, we usually wait to pump out  until 0.1-1mbar before biasing detectors because of this
3:53 that’s a premium eyebrow-tracking shot right there 😍
He's back!
EDUCATION!
Everyday i hope you won't kill yourself while making videos like those haha. Thank you for being there and making such amazing and interesting videos!
Stop your complaining! You were only dead for 30 seconds or so.
Using the 2000V transformer as a mousepad is a ballsy move😅😅😅
Another nordVPN shills. shame on you. shame on you.
@Theslowmoguys taking notes for a future video.
PTSD= Posttraumatic Shock Disorder
5:56
I assumed that fuses with a wee spring in them were Anti Surge fuses.
How didthe whole length of the cardboard boxes side ignite within a milliseond? Seems like it was doused with gasoline or something equivalent. It also does not look like a paper fire and the box not even gets charred?
Same gas as in old lightlamps is has more weight than air
If you use DC you would make a decent amount of soft x-rays hahaha
yes, totally use no protective eyewear when messing with hot melted wires catapulted by elastic bands....not.
Buy the dip people.
We are back to informative entertainment. Yes. Thank you!
Good snack for the kids when they grab a cookie
you can get a stronger transformer from me
I'm starting to think this guy provides crappy content with repetitive jokes
Mehdi has more lives than a herd of cats.
the elastic-band fuse makes soomuch sense... it may not be predictable where exactly the brake will happen but it still seems genuinly  genius
epic video.
Seriously, Mehdi Electroboom is good example of bad examples LOL
4uk safety precautions
Fuse current ratings are "max current that will not trip it", not "minimum current that will trip it". And they have "maximum time to tripping" values, as in multiple ones, depending on how much overcurrent there is. Margins can easily be 100 % to 300 %. Use other forms of circuit breakers if you need better margins.
I left the video knowing why there are fuses with spring-shaped wires on Plasma TV boards
Why are you not grounded working with high voltage?
They don't tell you you have to pay double if you don't want google to Think you are a robot every time you click on google. Just to use the VPN For this very reason mine is turned off most of the time.
I was trying to think of a joke about noble gases, but all the good ones argon.
Imagine mehdi transfer high voltage through his eyebrows 💀
Great video
Yhoo happy holidays manni you have no idea how much you're videos helped my electrical tests
5:50 goofy ahh laugh
0:00 i love how scared he is of exploding things that he got scared clapping 😭
Roses are red sky is blue  I have five finger To hold a fuse 💀
Try this similar test... Take a 230 volt AC household light switch and drive it with 230 volt DC. Then connect about a 5 amp heat lamp load... When you open the switch, it will struggle to break the circuit and an ark should form across its contacts and heat lamp will dim. Its kind of scary because you can't turn it off and watch as the switch glows blue and melts. 100 years ago, as an apprentice, I rewound a car alternator for 230 volt DC and discovered the problem with switching high DC voltage. I stopped the switch ark by fitting a capacitor across it.
High voltage fuses usually contain sand in the fuse body.
They probably used some non-flammable gasses like carbon dioxide, helium, or nitrogen in the high amp fuse.
i understand absolutely nothing about electronics, but this channel makes me think that maybe i do
Another ElectroBOOM video, another blessing that he isn't dead. 🙏
Hey Mashallah 🤩😂😂
Ok so what about the other way, if you have a fuse that's rated at 1000 amp and 1000 volts will it blow at 24 volts at 1100 amps? Or will it change how many amps it can handle with lower voltage?
If there is a gas in the fuse, it'd probably be SF6.
Transformer = mouse pad.. for the win
I wish Mehdi would wear safety glasses.
SloMo Guys need to do a video on fuses with springs under tension!
7:14 I really hope he at least quadruple checked the supply was off before touching BOTH the electrodes
5:50 Mehdi, you should go and visit a doctor!! I'm worried about your mental health.
It would be great to see that fuse blow at 125000 frames per second... Just saying
7:45 why does everyone have a cookie box but no one has cookies in it?
Didn't thank me for watching :(
Normal People: I’ll put my cookies in the oven  7:46 Mehdi: I put my oven parts in my cookie box  Absolute sigma🔥🗿
Mahdi died a while ago. This is his evil-er twin Shahdi
Coming soon, the Electroboom 5 million watt microwave. 100% chance to cook a neutron star to medium rare in less than a heartbeat
in your rubber band setup, what would have happened if the wire broke only on one far side of the wire rather than in the center area under tension?  The single spring model in the following segment seems to solve that problem.
If i want a teacher for electronics and electricals, I'll look up to him since he has 9 lives😂😂😂
Why would it make a difference if there is an inert gas inside the fuse, couldn’t the arc just travel through the air around it?
Flashbacks ....wonder where you got those from! ;-)
the first time mehdi seems to be happy that there aren't any big arcs
ElectroBOOM using casually a MOT as a mousepad
meanwhile the wire: you shall not escape burns mehdi
Would be awesome to see that springed fuse blowing up in super slow motion.
He's right!  I replaced all the circuit breakers on my house with NordVPN, and I feel much safer now!
Maybe a cheap option for a gas to fill the tube can be CO2. They are relatively easy and cheap to obtain, and based on my cursory googling, it is both noncombustible and electrically non conductive, though I dont know how much that matters.
I like how Mehdi used his transformer as a mouse pad.
You can be safer by not risking your life
that weird dissonance when Mehdi pretends to be suprised by something that he himself taught us before, just to keep individual video entertaining and aligned with the convention
so could it work if you fill aspirin case with very dry sand? could it arc through the sand?
Mehdi, I have an question. When I was younger we used to have big fuses (500A 250VAC) "protecting" car audio equipment (12.5~14.4VDC) or better protecting the car from the audio equipment, I never seen one of those pop, even when something bad happened, so my questio is: those 500A 250VAC fuses had any chance to pop if shortcircuited on an 14.4V system (2000A Battery + 500F SuperCapacitor)?
Some fuses have sand or sand-like particles inside them to prevent arcing. I wished if it was included in this video.
Whys is this channel so hilarious?
4:33 short circuit smoke.. dont breathe this! 😊
those initial versions remineded me of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NKOlLDNknc&ab_channel=Electricoperator
You should try remaking the Jacobs ladder but put it in you vacuum chamber, that would be a little safer than last time
Comming home from work, eating your food finding the best video and you find this<3 Love u mehdi
9:08  nice mouse pad!
Regarding gas inside the 5kV fuse, you could try and excite the gas inside this 5kV fuse with one of your coils and see if it is a noble gas by colour.
Yesterday replaced the fuse in my microwave oven and today you publish this video. What are the odds? 😂
I would say inside the fuse was something like argon as a protecting gas....
Typical family metal cookie box = sewing kit Medhi's metal cookie box = microwave bits
Need another collaboration with slomo guys!!!
I would say they use sulphur hexafluoride SF6 gas inside the fuses. That's the gas that is used in high voltage switches.
Use Absorption Spectroscopy to detect the gas present inside the fuse. Where the light from a source is sent through the gas collimated to fall into a spectrometer to find the lines absorbed and compare it with the available data sheet to find the gaseous compound.
Fuses for 50-500vac, in France at least but I think it's the same all over Europe, contain sand, which helps dissipate the arc energy and then the glass created adds insulation to the fuse. On the other hand, you're right about one thing: manufacturers use argon gas, or others depending on the patents I imagine, to create their "cutting chamber" in high-voltage and high-current circuit-breakers, and probably in "big" fuses too. Great video as usual!
Did you just say that the high-voltage transformer has killed you once before?
please, u must make a course of lectures. i am no science person who knows all those concepts to even understand ur videos, actually i recently become so much eager to learn science, and starts to self-taught, if u want the reason then its because to not go blind and start believing the various imaginary concepts, like sprituality and may be other sci. theories itself. so, it would be bless for me. or if not recommend me some sources; lectures, study materials anything. please
Life was better when express vpn was a sponsor 😢
Evertime i see mehdi touching wires I fear for his life
As far as I know sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is used often as an arc suppressor. An old (mid 90s) electron microscope I've used had it inside to avoid arcing between the high voltage (30kV) connectors. Due to a leak, we had to refill it every time we started hearing high voltage discharges.
Boomb
I bet grim reaper tired of waiting him to die
Would like to see how that fuse performs with stable DC when there is no 0V crossing and yeah, that partial vacuum discharge setup was impressive, could you test it with various frequencies?
Okay that's it. Petition to get Mehdi to fix his squeaky office chair on his Mehditation channel. That thing sounds like nails on a chalkboard on steroids. Plus, I miss some of his videos on that channel like "hoist your bike", the one where he reupholsters his dining chairs, etc.
Well, he always made a good fuse.
Electroboom giving new meaning to slow burning fuse.
Feliz navidaaaaaad
This is so fake.  I used NordVPN and I still got electrocuted 😂🤡
Ohh.... Man... Dude.. This Is Funny...😂😂😂😂
At this point.. I guess just finish the process and make an incandescent bulb
1:03 it's confirmed, there are multiple ElectroBOOM clones
You should get a foot pedal to turn this stuff on. That way if something goes wrong you just leaving will turn off the circuit.
Love the electric hybrid rocket engine you accidentally invented.
Just what I needed after this rotten day: sparks, fire, high voltages and some mild Mehdi burns...
i was scavenging parts to make a speaker, and I took apart an old CD player from Goodwill and saw a big transformer in it. I thought back to ElectroBoom and put that far away
potato                                                                (make this the most liked comment)
do these infotainment channels always upload together ??? For context Veritasium also uploaded today.
This was a really cool little experiment and a good explanation. Thanks Electroboom!
Over all Mehdi is a great technician but I feel like his weakness is planning ahead.😂
"Killed once before" what type of nercomancy is going on here
Pretty sure that spring fuse didn't completely vaporize.  Looks like the spring part was pulled completely to the side, hiding it from view.
High voltage glass fuses used in appliances like microwaves, also known as HV (high voltage) or MOV (Metal Oxide Varistor) fuses, typically contain an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon. These gases are chosen for their chemical stability and ability to prevent arcing inside the fuse during operation.
HAHA "GETTING" ptds = you already have it
Nordman sends his regards!
sulfur hexafloride
Some fuses actually have gases inside them, I got a couple of those old screw type fuses that were blown and I wanted to test it if since they have that view port they would make a good mini arc bulb, and the arc actually jumped and gave off different colors depending on the fuse, one had a yellow arc in it, I think another had a purplish red, so that was interesting
Moms put sewing kits in cookie boxes And Mehdi puts oven parts
wow! what an arc! already waiting next video about handmade vacuum tubes
"lets not get burnt"  *instantly gets burnt*
You should build an arc discharge strobe, we sometimes host external events in our school's aula and I managed to convince the principle to buy 2 atomic 3000 dmx strobes, they are fun! But at a combined peak power of only 9kW they are fun, but you could do better! Also my solution for power is absolutely scary, it's the most cursed adapter ever, like the one you used to run your sister's hairdryer on 2 phase 120v just that both plugs are wired in parallel and connect to 2 16A 230V circuits on the same phase of our 3 phase supply.
Video Idea: Build a deadman foot switch that you have to keep pressed in order to get mains voltage whenever you are doing something with the MW transformer. In case of an accident like with the Jacobs ladder it could safe your life :)
Please stay safe bro. Enjoying the channel as always
bigclive made a video all about fuses and how some need to be sand-filled. i am not saying he is better than you, but he does make a lot of very high quality videos. a _lot_ of them. have you been busy of late? too busy for us, the great unwashed?
Mehdi again made a  bulb 😂
Thank You! For entertaining and for telling these amazing stuff and doing it practically too!
Numbnuts using a mouse on a microwave oven transformer. Just love this guy.
Circuit brakers does extinguish electric arc same way, by pulling contacts apart very quick (not only by pulling contacts fast they have more strategies to extinguish arcs like multi point contacts to spread arc trough multiple points... But this is main idea and that's allso what makes circuit braker pop sound)
After watching his video i just make my mind to pursue electrical engineering
So he is undead by now. Makes sense...
Such a man doesnt need a fuse, he is the fuse himself 😅
Glass fuses commonly contain nitrogen gas to prevent arcs. Sulfur Hexafluoride is also used to insulate fuses with higher voltage ratings.
Agron probably a best candidate.     Just imagine a big fuse like old tungsten bulbs
I didn't know that HV fuses are held in tension. I also didn't know that HV transformers can be used as a mouse pad. So much educational.
In general, glass-sealed fuses, including those used in microwave ovens, are typically filled with an inert gas, such as nitrogen. The purpose of the gas is to provide a medium inside the fuse that does not support combustion and helps to prevent the formation of arcs when the fuse blows.  When a fuse blows, the metal inside the fuse melts or vaporizes, creating an open circuit. The presence of an inert gas helps in quickly extinguishing any potential arc that might occur when the circuit is interrupted. This is important for safety reasons, as it helps minimize the risk of fire or damage to surrounding components.  The specific gas used can vary between manufacturers and fuse types, but inert gases like nitrogen are commonly employed for this purpose. The gas is sealed within the glass or ceramic tube during the manufacturing process, creating a controlled environment that enhances the safety and reliability of the fuse.
hi
I came here an hour after uploading, so I would be one of the first people to comment
Some fuses use explosive charges to separate the conductors quickly. They're commonly used on pole transformer fuses...loud too.
Good "amount" of vacuum.. it's clear what was meant by that, but sounds funny - which amount of nothing is enough?
1:03 “Killed me once before.” Medhi clone confirmed..?!
Hair raising as always 😮
You can divide the fuse into several sections using ceramic partitions, and pass the wire through the holes in it. Theoretically, this will help to mechanically extinguish the arc.
Sulfur hexafloride is used in some really high voltage interrupters, to extinguish the arc quickly. It's a gas that is a very strong insulator.
the absolute delight I felt when I see Mehdi using the exact same mini mouse I use
Ironic
Full video of fuse blowing with the slowmo guys?
What about the fuses with sand inside? Is that against arcs too?
5:00 You can listen how the pump changes his noise when the transformer is working.
New light or camera vedio quality is awesome now
Must be hard being gifted with multiple lives 1:02
درود مهندس مهدی مثل همیشه عالی، اگه امکان داره زودتر ویدئو آپلود کنید...  سپاس
I thought electricboom used himself as the fuse inside a circuit?
Here in the US fuses tend to contain 50% krypton gas.
Afaik sulfur hexafluoride is used to keep arc creation at a certain low level. Could be the gas in that high voltage fuse (?)
https://www.google.com/search?q=high+voltage+fuse&sca_esv=592257846&rlz=1C1VDKB_enMU1081MU1081&tbm=isch&sxsrf=AM9HkKlHUdv2Tycau7kCX_dku7BBYNbK5w:1703010300257&source=lnms&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=2ahUKEwiSkPvfj5yDAxUqQEEAHTWpDN8Q_AUoAXoECAMQAw&biw=1920&bih=919&dpr=1#imgrc=InPTpwKWwVozGM
4:20 another medicine 💊 bottle from #@%*&^ button video?
Some high-voltage fuses have a quartz sand filling.
You need explosives to make a high voltage fuse and sand or other materials to extinguish the arc including arc chutes
9:05  mouse pad :NAH  microwave oven transformer : YUP
The PTSD hitting hard
Mehdi : Now I become builder,               The maker of fuses😂😂
Why dont you use an old neon sign transformer? They are cheap, heavy and have 5-15KV output.
regular oil changes are important for your car .... just not as important as for this jiggavolt switch!
I have à transformer
Mehdi : Lets not get burned Mehdi proceeds getting burnt ElectroBoom logic 👍
This is the same reason why if a Filament bulb starts flashing, if you disconnect the power, it'll never light again, the filament breaks and the voltage jumps between the break - No fuse is under a vacuum
#ElectroBoomQuestionAnswer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyPTDjHlBJw
All Hail ElectroBOOM ❤
Wanna challenge? Try to blow up fuse used in EV cars for high voltage circuit.
a
I like turtles.
Because volts isn't what makes the heay
This man is a genius, he learn us so much with his played clumsiness.
great video as always
5:00 Congratulations, you've just invented the light bulb!
Hi 🤣🤣🤣 0:00
Man mehdi, i didn't know you died before! Sick!
if you go frame by frame on the fuse there's one frame with the green plasma of what i assume is copper
When about a dielectric oil in the fuse case.  Help dissipate heat reduction in arc
Finally, a redundant switch! 3:48
A lot of modern high voltage, high power fuses are vacuum fuses. Vacuum increases arcing distance until you get the pressure low enough, then it rapidly decreases. Pull a better vacuum and that fuse will work.
8:42 - Where are the Slomo Guys????
You will kill yourself oneday 😅😅be careful I know you play well with electrical equipment
Would love to see you slowly make all electronic components by hand. You’ve made capacitors, resistors, inductors, relays and now fuses. Diodes shouldn’t be hard, you can make transistors from diodes. After a while you can make circuits with your diy components
Hi!
3:38
How did you ressurect after dying?
I think he burned himself every time he has a fuse next to him that’s heated
With a new Electroboom video, it's always a good day.
Yes doc Emmett Brown time 4:29 😂😂😂😂 (that face)
This felt like a fun old fashioned Electroboom video! More of these please!
How is your skin not like leather at this point lol...
i think the glass fuses are filled with noble as but dont quote me
great entertainment and some education worked in, awesome, thanks Mr Boom!
PTSD? in your case, Post Traumatic Shock Discharge :p
"Well, that was a failiure! *laughs hysterically* "
And don't forget that AC and DC behave very different when using fuses and breakers. Breaking DC is a complete separate story.
The spring worked, it hid in the fuse cap. Check there :D
9:04 You ain't a gangtsa until you use a 2KV☠ microwave transformer as mousepad 🥶😎
What happened in your vacuum bell, the low pressure arcs, is what caused a launch failure on an electron rocket recently.
Electroboom plz make video every 2 day plz i love your video ❤❤
There are also ballistic fuses for 100+ kV grid installations, where the arc detonates a small explosive load inca mini mortar. This shoots out a plug at the end of a conductor which made the connection at the first place. The distance to break the arc can be several meters in a very short time. It is also resettable by replacing the explosive charge and plugging the whole thing together again. @electroBoom Would you like to diy one of those?😂 Most of us would enjoy watching you do it
Where are the Slo Mo guys when you need them?😅
Fuses seems to be so trivial... A hilarious video to show that they are not.
1 hour ago!!!!????
Mehdi, you make me think too much. My brain fuse blew. Also, this was cool as usual beacuse your stuff is awesome like that.
You're not the fuse? 🤣
Is that why uk fuses have sand / silica in them ?
i have a question. Is the voltage of electricity infinite and it is just capped at a specific volt or does it come in different voltages based on your power line or something?  hopefully you answer :D  btw love your content its very educational
My idol
Norwegian tap water don't carry current, it is to clean. The firebrigade uses water on electric fire here. But with cause. Because when even the clean water hits something, then it is no longer clean.....
Hamshahri, I love your channel.
Well if you have circuit rated for 12 volts with 12v fuse. The rest of the circuit isn't going be designed around 20 thousand volts. That just ridiculous.
This dude where the fuck would we be without him
Well, that was instructive!
Так разбери торцы предохранителя и увидишь, что там😂
Specific chapter inside the video for the sponsor. ElectroBOOM is da real MVP.
I swear he is becoming more like a gorilla every video. His hair on his arms seems to be getting thicker. I bet you are a skinwalker deep down
yeeess a new EB video
Good video . Educational . Thanks man .
Medhi using his transformer as his mousepad is just genius😂
You should build a nuke
I have seen breakers for power generation. It used air compressed to 300bar to blow out the arc.   And enourmous springs tensioned with hydraulics to pull the connector apart about a meter.  Not reccomended to be near one when it pops!
Really disappointed in yo Mehdi, LTT is not it.
I imagine these fuses could be filled with sulphur hexafluoride, a gas frequently used to quench high voltage arcs. it's also used in high power switching equipment to eliminate those arcs. it's a great insulator too
I think something went wrong because often in HV AC power switch vacum is one of the extinguishing agent. SF6 is second most common solution.
Mehdi re invented the lightbulb
Nice touch at the end using the microwave transformer as a mouse pad! I reeeeally hope it was fully discharged before you did that...
it has  "killde" me once
I asked chat gpt and the special gases are sulfur hexafluoride or nitrogen . these gases help quench the arch formed   then i asked chat gpt name 5 gases for the above and it says  sulfur hexaflu  N2 hexafluroethane mineral oil hmmm wonder what if i type name 30 for the above :P
Like what you think if its high deggres on glass
7:12 I would love to see that a 800,000 fps. Someone call the SloMo Guys!
I should make a deadman switch in your next video, so you won't have to rely on a simple power switch. Especially when dealing with transformers.
Argon?  LOL that's how you meke a neon light.  Argon in a tube with high voltage.  I was so hoping your were oging to do that.
PSA: Although he's joking about being killed by a transformer .. microwave transformers *_WILL_* kill you if you disrespect them in the slightest. They are the cause of death for many *_MANY_* hobbyists every year. PLEASE DO NOT PLAY WITH THEM UNLESS YOU KNOW *_EXACTLY_* WHAT YOU ARE DOING! ☮
Surprised that sand-filled fuses did not make an appearance.
It scares me quite a bit when you hold one MOT electrode on each hand like that, even with the insulation. I'm pretty sure that you know what you're doing but I just wanted to remind that electricity has a tendency to find a way and the insulation of the plastic might break. Even a hairline of carbonization in the plastic is enough to make the person holding them a part of the circuit. Maybe I'm a bit too worried, but I just wanted to get it out of my chest.
I have a transformer I'm going to throw out. If you want it tell me how to get it to you.
9:04  using the mouse on top of the transformer is something only mehdi would do
ah yes - Mehdi was killed. https://youtu.be/pcv4SKCpKKs?si=aUgxag4vfvNK7sYC&t=10
I didnt like my own comment
Wish you merry christmass E-B00M
"I keep my microwave oven parts in my cookie box" - Electro boom (maybe)
9:04 Best mouse-pad in the world
So, the oven transformer is now a mouse pad! 😅😅😅
Most dangerous canadian on youtube
Pron block my country
The 15a fuse is not for 250v bruh💀
Would be interesting to use multiple low-rated fuses in series. If the first melts and arcs, a second one would melt and increase the gap ^^
Bro burned his skin in less than 20s💀
Using it outside the rating and there will be death and destruction… is that a promise?
Power in toilet next episode plz
love your videos
God is back
Mehdi, it makes my day when I see you have uploaded a new video! Cheers my good man!
5:15 Why is it that color? That's the color of arcing sodium vapor.
6:00 Please, please use the one hand technique when working with MOTs, they are unbelievably scary, and you usually don't get a second chance if you screw up. I love watching your content, it's informative and hilarious, and your lax safety standards are part of that, but MOTs are an entirely different beast compared to many other power sources. AC flyback transformers are far less dangerous, since they oscillate faster than your nerves can react, so it would be a safer option if you want to work with large hot arcs. (ions must be pushed along the voltage gradient to activate your nerves, at these frequencies, they just vibrate in place instead of going anywhere. It can still burn you though, if you touch the plasma or pass too much current, but it takes much more current to do that than it would to stop your heart with DC or low frequency AC.)
Hi! Great and fun video as always^⁠_⁠^. What I found is silica sand or some other non conducting liquid is used mostly as a filling inside those fuses Wikipedia says-- The fuse element may be surrounded by air, or by materials intended to speed the quenching of the arc. Silica sand or non-conducting liquids may be used. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuse_(electrical)
I once accidentally used a C13 cable for my computer that had a 3A fuse in it (yes I am from the EU lol). I have no idea how on earth a 3 amp fuse got in that cable, but it did come with a used power supply that was "tested". My computer turned on sometimes, but kept turning off randomly or refusing to start at all sometimes. Turns out, it needed a 13 amp fuse, I want to write a mean email to whoever packed that cable. :)
Very happy to see new video from Electroboom after a bit of time. Love from India❤
I'm sure you've seen the fuses they use on (at least in the US) power lines? They have gun powder in them and an expansion piston so as the fuse blows it ignites the gun powder pushing the contacts far apart to quench the arc! Seems right up your alley to build....
Normal people: * Have sewing kits in Cookie metal boxes* ElectroBOOM: * Has microwave parts in Cookie metal boxes*
Big faan
Another Youtuber should create an AI spotter to cut power when Mehdi gets in trouble.
7:27 this is why in higher amp glass tube fuses they would commonly use a crimped metal piece, or even an actual spring, so when it failed, spring tension would cause the pieces to move away from each other.
I too have been killed by a transformer. Remember that death is bad for your health.
I feel like you faked learning about this by experimentation. You just read the articles ahead of time and pretend to figure it out.

camera literally dims in the vaccuum chamber scene
😂I had to 1:22
Sulfur hexafluoride is good for quenching arcs. And it would be hilarious to hear Mehdi's voice after inhaling it 😂
high voltage fuses contain gas-evolving substances such as boric acid  .When the fuse blows, heat from the arc causes the boric acid to evolve large volumes of gases The gas helps to extinguish the arc and prevent further damage to the electrical system
I refuse to keep watching this shocking channel. Highly revolting, and currently gives me hypertension. I try to resist, but nothing insulates me from Mehdi's monobrow humour.
Be careful about running arcs in a partial vacuum. That’s how X-rays are made, and X-rays are dangerous.
Try transform 230V to 1000000V
Maybe the SloMo guys could film the high voltage fuse opening...
Please, tell me that you turned off the outlet between 7:11 and 7:13
Hi guys 👋🤠👍
With Electroboom every fuse “comes”.
🙌🏻🙌🏻
I have also seen some filled with sand
why mehdis forehead becoming more and more shiny. his skin is becoming like glass. does getting shocked make your skin turn glossy
finally
1:04 "One of them has killed me once before" So he HAS died, gotta wonder how he keeps coming back to life
You are my childhood, I used to watch your videos and couldn't understand anything but still those goofy things always made me laugh ❤
In the power industry they use sulfur hexafluoride  (SF6) gas in special arc quenching circuit breakers. Often there's a special mechanism, to open a gas valve as the breaker opens up, to basically blow the arc out. I remember seeing one in action, in "power lab", back in school, when getting my EE degree (1980s). Power lab was scary, as much of the gear was the size of van, with high power resistors that actually glowed under normal operation. Syncing up the large synchronous machine (could work as both generator or motor) just before connecting it to the 3 phase grid, was always a tad sphincter puckering !
So he confirmed himself that he had extra lives since he say he died to the Jacobs ladder
"let's see if the fuse blows"  Famous last words
normal people : let's put sewing thread and needles in cookie box Meanwhile Electroboom : let me find the microwave fuse from cookie box
1:01so Mehdi got second life😅
i vaguly remember seeing a big clive video breaking open a high voltage fuse (like way up in the kilovolt range) and it was filled with some kind of sand
I've about died from laughing at this and the toilet video 😂. Mehdi is the GOAT at teaching with humor.
Video idea: zenner Diode
“The arcs never die” - this needs to be a slogan for something
Does this come under Electroboom's HAIR raising experiments...
i love you medi
How these high voltage fuses work, is remarkable. Mechanical combined with destructive. Nice video boomsie. So, you say you want a stronger transformer huh? 😉
Touching the blown fuse with both hands at 7:15 I felt very uncomfortable because did not see you to cut the power off o_O
@ElectroBOOM there are actually a lot of fuses and even transformers using low conductive gases to isolate from arcs. Have seen and used some as electrician in germany
Guys he is back again, call the police 😂
Technology connections collab when?
I’d love to see Mehdi make a plasma sputtering machine.
Ww2 soilder: i have more PTSD then anyone  ElectroBOOM: get the fuck out the way 🗿
Are you sure that the spring vaporized? It may have retracted fully inside the end-cap. I would expect the spring to have a higher current capacity than the fusible element. Also, many high amperage industrial fuses pack sand around the fusible element for arc quenching. I'm not sure if that would also work for high voltage. Sounds like another experiment. (Though the sand will block the view of the camera so it might not be as visually interesting.)
احب محتواك جدا❤❤❤
Hey look ElectricImma1st ⚡
The starting 😅😅
great, thanks Madhi
I think the reason the spring fuse worked well is because you don't need the wire to completely disconnect or melt for it to work. All you need is the wire to sublimate enough for the tension of the spring to be able to tear the wire apart. You won't get much arching because the wire goes in a split second from a short to a significant gap.   I think the spring just retracted in the flash as opposed to completely disappearing. That's also probably why there's no residue where the spring used to be. Only where the wire used to be.
in de past i was confused that 250V fuses could have more Amps on lower voltage rates. I thought it was all about Power instead of the amperage.
The rated volatage is mostly to say that the fuse will predictably melt at the overcurrent. If the voltage is higher the arc will keep the shortcircuit going and damage the cables insulation. A 16A fuse for 12V will still melt with 16A at 230V, the arc keeping the shortcircuit going is a problem tho.
Some types of fuses may contain gas inside them, such as expulsion fuses. Expulsion fuses are filled with different types of gas that act when they are heated up. Expulsion fuses are used for high voltage applications, such as transformers and switchgear. Boric gas: Boric gas is a type of de-ionizing gas that is used in expulsion fuses for high voltage applications, such as transformers and switchgear. Boric gas acts when it is heated up by the arc and decomposes into water vapor. The water vapor blasts the arc and prevents it from reigniting. Vacuum: Vacuum is created by evacuating the air from a metal tube or a ceramic body inside the fuse. When a fault occurs, the vacuum expands rapidly and creates a high pressure that blows out the arc. SF6: SF6 stands for sulfur hexafluoride, which is a type of inert gas that is used in expulsion fuses. SF6 has a high dielectric strength and can withstand high temperatures and voltages. SF6 also has a low reactivity and does not support combustion or oxidation. Soapstone: Soapstone is a type of mineral that contains calcium carbonate. Soapstone is used as a fuse tube material in some types of expulsion fuses. Soapstone has a low thermal conductivity and can resist melting or burning when exposed to high temperatures. from gpt-4, bing
Atleast he not use air horn to stop fire
Best high voltage fuse:  The US Penny!
even if i'm not a master electrician like electroboom, i still seem to learn a lot from him! at least i can yell "FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER!!!" without being a weirdo.
Electrical engineer pretends to be bad at electrical engineering so that internet plebs can learn through curiosity like when people first built this stuff.
Great video sand also helps
Oh no a fuse
On your power lines the fuse cut out works on the same principle there's always tension on the fuse link
ello again XD, please stop trying to end your life XD
No one can use a microwave transformer as a mouse pad except Mehdi💀
I have seen high voltage fuses for 20kV with explosives for arc quenching and tripping the circit breaker by blasting a pin out the end. Length of these is about 50-60cm.
4:22 best led I've ever seen
On your power lines the fuse cut out works on the same principle there's always tension on the fuse link

Mehdi my father loves your videos a lot. He is also an electric engineer and is also from Iran ❤
Pls make more videos we wait for it
Just use more fuses in series!
Oh man... was hoping for some sulfur hexafluoride voice modification. That stuff is a great arc extinguisher.
That Quick Blow Microwave fuse would be great to see in Ultra SLO- MO... maybe a word with the Slo-Mo Guys for another Collaberation?
5;59 I have probably 10 transformers you could borrow one if you want it's only shocking until you die
MOARRRR ELECTROBOOM! Muhahahaha
av popped it
At 5:00 Mehdi discovers that air is a better insulator than vacuum.
Typical Middle Eastern, we always use the cookie box for more noble needs
Finally a new video of eletrcoBoom gat shocked
As far as i know, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is often used in high voltage applications.
Congrats you Made a light bulb 😂😂👍
I thought they make them with sand around the fuse wire for high volage stuff? I thought that was where the film canister idea was going, e.g. fill it with sand after the fuse ia made.
For high voltage fuse, I think there were no external spring but the fuse wire itself was twisted like a spring and then stretched. Pretty good mechanics.   And why the video is so short :-(
1:06  I'm sorry, killed you ?
Why you so smart ?
imagine a 9 min vid with a 90 sec sponsor spot, that is tv-level stuff
6:36 **Disappear**
You know it's a good day when electroboom posts, and we know he's not dead
Just put that thing next to a tesla coil and you'll know by the glow if is there's any gas inside the tube.
very nice
What happened to your high voltage fuse?
i think you can use nitrogen gas in these tubes
Sulfur hexafluoride (sf6) is often used as high voltage insulator gas
Making a high voltage fuse is a simple and easy process. Here are the steps you need to take: 1. Gather the necessary materials. You will need a ceramic tube, an insulator, two lead wires, and a fuse element. 2. Attach the lead wires to the insulator. Make sure that the connection is secure. 3. Insert the fuse element into the ceramic tube. Make sure that the fuse element is centered. 4. Place the ceramic tube into the insulator and secure it. 5. Connect the lead wires to the fuse element. 6. Test the fuse to make sure that it is working properly. Once you have followed these steps, you will have successfully created a high voltage fuse.
There is only one person on this planet who uses a high voltage transformer as mouse pad 🤣
Free Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
9:09 .... HV fuses might have SF6 gas as it is in GIS circuit breaker
Some high-current fuses are filled with Silicasand, the sand melts and blocks the flow.
Dude I love mahdi he's so good beside that he's persian like me he's INSANE LIKE ME
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Gases for arc suppression:  Aircraft piston engine magnetos were pressurized with air to a few tens of PSI for better performance at high altitude.  Portable industrial x-ray tubes are pressurized with SF6 to around 50 PSI to suppress arcing from tens of kilovolts of potential.   Happy holidays, Mehdi.
Where is your video with Linus 🎉🎉🎉
Arc quenching is a fascinating topic. One of those british or australian electronics youtubers did a teardown of circuit breakers and showed some of the purely geometrical design elements used to encourage arcs to die quickly. Interesting stuff!
4:24 bro just made a rocket Integza would be proud
0:04 dude probably has more PTSD than a Vietnam war general
no, all gases ionize, its just air, not vacuum, might be over-pressure instead, even less arc jumping
When i worked as electrician, we had fuses filled with sand, exactly for the purpose to avoid arcs.
lol, educative and entertaining as always  edit: how are some people hours ago☠
Patrick starr crossed with nicola tesla.
Funny
@electroboom Use SF6 gas I guess? it usually used as an insulator.
Mehdi not using safety glasses while testing a rubber band contraption that would catapult a molten piece of metal is... expected I guess?
Here’s a tip coming from a fellow Electrician. The cheapest option for a Fuse still isn’t to make your own Fuse through scrap metals.  Your house burning down after a failed electronics experiment makes a great fuse! Your house burns the wiring around the house, which cuts off the City Power going to your house!
0:16 perfectly cut scream
100 💯  Make a best of boom!
new camera detected,
New video❤
ElectroBoom should re try a jacobs ladder but in a vacuum chamber!
We love u mr boom u silly boy 😢
1:05 I saw on a TV Show, some large transformers that the Mexican Cartel tried to smuggle bricks of cocaine, hidden in the coils. Very elaborate!
electroboom playing with flying molten metals from the fuse with no safety glasses sounds about right.  stay being mehdi.
Early!
The video came 7 minutes ago for me? Anyways good video!
I'm convinced that most people come here to see Mehdi get hurt
Sadly in covid atm. Can't watch yet due dizzy. But yay long vid
I always considered him a fuse.
Ironic how he didn’t even try to pull the plug when the fire caught 💀 🗿
Do you know a fuse is just a low voltage resistor that is aplied on high voltage and it get burnt
So Mehdi has 8 Lives left.
How do you manage to teach us things while being absolutely hilarious!? 😂
Can you make a 10.000 voltage taser with long range? (To defense my home)
New way to get shocked😅
Me trying it with a high voltage generator like the one that electoboom made with car ignition coil BUT WITH MUCH.......... MORE POWERFUL ONE.😂😂😂
💡
first!!!
please marry me
Damn, showing your meat like this? Isn't that against youtube's TOS?
Just imagine how will he die after such dangerous experiments on himself
Yay! New video! You are always explaining so well while combining some humor and smart staged tricks for entertainment! Oh do i wish schools would make their lessons this exciting but they wont
Could you make a video explaining in-depth what admittance, immittance, susceptance and impedance is?
Notification Squad!🔥🔥🔥 Happy holiday, hope y'all going good!🎅🎁🎄

Hi
I have 1 issue with your springy design. If the load is not too big to break the wire, normal conducting is heating it up and it becames more soft and the rubber can pull it apart easier. Over time it will weaken your material. But that's just my theory, I'm a programmer and data engineer, not an electrical engineer or physicist. Hmm, it seems you were onto something with your design since the original fuse is something similar too.  9:05 - I like your mouse pad :D
Electroboom making a fuse seems oddly ironic
The fuses are filled with a dedicated mixture of around 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and some precisely chosen trace amounts of carbon dioxide, neon, xenon, argon...  (I'm no expert - don't quote me on that)
People probably nag you a lot about safety, but you should definitely wear safety goggles when working with white-hot metal right at your eye level.
More exquisite ZAPs. Keep them coming! Wonder if Mehdi will ever build something like his van de graaf generator or his high voltage wand?
Wait, if he died from the Jacob's ladder video then who is this, unless.... Mecha-Mehdi!?! He must feed off of all the shocks!
I'm always so happy when he uploads.
