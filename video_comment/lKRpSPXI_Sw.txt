This is the last dance between Djokovic & Monfils

8:15 Opelka serves like a rocket🚀
Me gusta tennis ; participo abiertos; Australia.  2025.
who wore it better?

Perricard def has more than a serve. Hopefully, he’ll learn to disguise it more. Apart from that, am sure he’ll get  in the top 10…
Perricard is my new favorite player to watch! He plays how a big man should play! Murders those serves, pounds those groundstrokes, and attacks the net relentlessly! Love his one-handed backhand and demeanor too!
I hope alcaraz, sinner and perricard be the new big 3
You legend Novak
pericard will destroy djoker , he will probably fake some injury to avoid humiliation
love love love Pericard. For a giant, he must have the best body. Wish I could see him vs Opelka in "The match of the VIKINGS".
GMP looks hugely impressive 😮
Need a compilation of those 20 match points between Djoko and Monfils.
🐐
I have the impresion each year the players rise their level more and more again. Sky is the limit. Incredible (applies to women's tennis too)
Djokovic doesn't look 37yrs old
Mensik bit of a dark horse in this tournament
Perricard is the new Delpo
monfils should stop playing, he easily gives up
Wow Perricard! And it seems he can still improve his game so much.
What is that white racquet Opelka's using??? Did he give up on pro staff?
xzccxz
at this point with Nole & Monfils its like a couple of old pals getting together grabbing a beer whenever they play. love these two old guards.
20-0😂
Is Djokovic wearing those Asics shoes?
20 straight wins over a player is almost as impressive as his 24 GS titles 😂😂😂
The guy in the pink hat shouldn't be playing tennis. He should be playing basketball, hehehehehe.
Perricard espectacular!
Good tennis from Mpetshi.
Gmp. The New n°1 clearly
GMP is climbing the ATP rankings blindly fast.
One handed backhand is alive with Perricard
Monfils reminds me of James Blake and Donald young…so much talent…didn’t win many titles…it takes so much to get to that next level
Unreal that a player as good as Monfils hasn’t recorded a single win over Djoker
Djokovic going 20-0 against Monfils is simply despicable😂
Mpetshi's backhand is looking lethal
Monfils and Novak played against each other 20 times. Twenty wins for Novak making Monfils his best customer.
Monfils must think:  "Next timeI will  defeat NOvak,  nobody beats me 21 times in a row"
またモンフィスは記録を伸ばしたのか
Rooting for Perricard this year. What a legend
Great backhand Perricard!
Monfils trying to counterpunch w Novak has NEVER worked in 15 years and yet he keeps trying it. 2:14 is a great example, he lets Novak back into the point vs ghosting to the net and finishing him. It’s like Monfils is so conditioned to losing he won’t even try anything that might get him a W
Novak is such a great sport I see he often shows applause to his opposition
It's not often we get a player who comes along with 3 complete weapons (serve, forehand, and backhand) combined with top notch athleticism and touch/feel around the net. Mpetshi Perricard appears to be the real deal! I'm looking forward to seeing how he advances in the next few years.
GMP is 6' 8'' but also actually good at tennis. What a monster.
Perricard 👌👌 So entertaining to watch
If you keep doing the same thing you get the same results
Great highlights!!!   Nice to see Opelka back on the courts (and in pink hat, shoes and the infamous pink tote)!
Frances needs a new coach. He also needs to change some things😮😮
Nole is still looking physically sharp with his 37 and chasing records after records. Mpetshi Perricard and Mensik will be one of the rising stars in 2025.
This kid will make the top 10 this year
did opelka switch racquets or just a different paint?
Black kings 🎉
Perricard is so talented for his age ! His one handed backhand has improved so much over the last few months. This man has definitely a great future ahead of him if he can maintain his body in shape..
I believe mpetshi could become a formidable player.  At the moment i feel his ground strokes need changes. The pace should be dropped for more consitent rallies ..  You will notice that his sets end at very close numbers.  Meaning if he was playing someone like sinner who can return and hit incredible consistent ground strokes he will get broken easily.  I hope his coach can work on his weakness.  I like him as a player no tricks and so on. He just wants to play and go by his business.
Que aburrido es ver jugar a Opelka 😮‍💨
Wait, why am I seeing pickleball highli.... oh, never mind, GMP and Opelka are just so huge they make it look like they're on a pickleball court.
Watching Djokovic vs Monfils is like watching a movie you know the end, Djokovic must be bored playing Monfils, he is like this guy again.
Poor Arnoldi, dude lost his balls in the breaker
Never in history has there been a more one-sided match than Djokovic vs Monfils. Two veterans playing their 20th match after 20 years since their first match (2005). 20 wins for Novak. Wicked😊
Goat looking really 👍 good 😊  Well played goat king Novak Djokovic go and grab Australian open ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Love from india nole ❤❤
Mpetsi is like Tiafoe, but without being a arrogant clown all the time trying to show off
Insane record, 20-0, by the GOAT, Djokovic, versus the luckless but always gregarious Frenchman, Monfils.
An Elegant Giant, that's Mpetshi Perricard.
I love when Tiafoe gets his ass handed to him🤭🤭🤭
Mpetshi Perricard casually playing in his boxer shorts as if there's nothing to see.
I really like mpetshi
Mpetshi Perricard has one of the most fun games to watch on tour right now. Hope he keeps improving
Death, taxes, and Djokovic beating Monfils lol. I used to think Ferrer's record vs Federer was about as bad as it gets
First time that I saw Perricard play I was super impressed, specially by his serve and volley. The dude has so many weapons. I see him reaching top 5.
5:55 again… Tiafoe is such a disappointment when he want voluntarily hit Pericard with that smash in front. He could have change direction like go on his right, nope! Get in front and try to hit Giovanni to score… like he did in the double at laver cup against rog and Nadal. How is good see him lose🤡🤡come si gode per la merda che è 😂😂
Perricard and his team know what they're doing as he sticks to his weapons relentlessly.
8:25 what a serve
Perricard migliorato tantissimo. Tra gli italiani oltre a Sinner non mi sembra ci sia nessuno che possa andare in top 5
My bet: Mpetshi will end 2025 as a top 10 player
Perricard is the loving embodiment of Pure Drive!
Perricard is going to top 10 in 2025
Tiafoe perdio con su hermano africano del Congo
Opelka showing up. Groundies looking like he's been working.
Monfils needs to change his strategy for Joker. He likes pace. Throw in some variation like slices, dropshots, moonballs to throw off his rhythm and then go big. He hates the slow pace
This guy is exciting. Hope he turns into another great.
Perricard keeping the one hander alive in this next gen. Powerful shot like Stan! 😮
Why do players put their hands through their wet hair then shake hands?
Opelka looks like he’s just been rescued from a deserted island
Perricard is a one hit wonder😊yes service is strong but thats all😂
GMP is not a serve bot. Woe betides those who consider him as one
Perricard is a beast but his forehand is very underwhelming... If he took the time to tweak the technique he'd have way more power and would be seemingly unstoppable
God I can't get enough of GMP! How does he keep getting better and better?! Please don't let me down, I'm so emotionally invested in his trajectory now lol
Opelka vs Perricard is the final we all want
GMP is like Tsonga with a better serve and better BH. Sounds like a slam winner to me!
6'8...One arm backhand...130mph 1st and 2nd serves...it's like an 8yr old kid built a super custom character in a video game in Perricard. I'd love to see a lighter player absolutely chop his legs away in a 5 setter and render him useless...
Really opelka is back ,just  needs to stay fit
Monfils never had and never will have what it takes to beat that Tier 1 of players. He's achieved the max that could be achieved considering his deficiencies.
Novak vs Gael was the usual, LOL!😂But Mpetschi Perricard and Opelka played like a beast today!!👏💪🎾😱
Mate... Mpetshi Perricard is not a simple servebot 😮😮😮
Became a fan of Perricard from now
Where is his so new couch Andy Murray?
Always a good day when Tiaclown loses
scary when you realize that Mpetshi Perricard is only 8 cm shorter than Opelka but can run and move twice as fast.
No one beats la monf 21 times in a row.
6:43 SABR
Djoko destroyed Monfils as always
Monfils's ball quality is really subpar. Such an easy match up for Djokovic, he always has time and can do whatever he wants with the ball. Im surprised Monfils didn't try any new tactics after losing 19 times. Did he really think this would be enough to disrupt Novak? Why not go for a little more and take every opportunity to play agressive and come to net
4:56 Sampras approved 🌟
How dare these clowns beat the big foe?😂😂😂
Perricard will be tough to beat this year…
The old man is really trying to win Brisbane,what does he think he is 25 years old,he's gonna be eaten alive by Sinner in AO either way,but at this rate he's not even going be in shape to fight back 😂
Love to see a one hand BH. Go Perricard!
Vraiment chouette  de voir  des reflets de  ce tournoi  merciiii 🎾👌😄💙
Mpetshi Perricard seems to be extremely talented, i got a feeling he would be top 3 material, challenging Alcaraz and Sinner for slams.
arnaldi so bad.. dna looser
Best server is opelka
Monfils Djokovic first played in 2005. A 20 year long rivalry !
I just want to watch a Mpetshi vs Nole match - best server of the tournament and one of the best servers  right now, vs the best returner ever !
Gmp has every thing to win slams...please use it wisely
Nobody beats monfils 21 times in a row
Opelka needs to figure out how to break serve as it puts way to much pressure on his service game. Figure out how to be a better defender then he might be able to break through
Brutal performance by Novak, as expected from the king of AO.
Pteshi-perricard looks like he's gone up another level.. now the backhand is a weapon too, and I love how he's been choosing to go all out attack on the big points, great player
I can't believe that after all these years they're still allowing players to compete wearing the exact same colour outfits - it's absolutely ridiculous and plain stupid.  They absolutely need to decide on the outfits many hours before the match, and make sure they're different colours!!!
Nico jarry ??????????
I think Novak plays much better than last year. Footwork, power, and placement
Got to suck losing to the same guy 20 times in a row
Perricard ❤❤
perricard joga muito... mão pesada
GMP IS MY SUCCESSOR OF WAWRINKA TO FOLLOW🐐❤️
6:57 sick dab
Monfils: "Nobody can beat me 20 times in a row."  Djokovic: "Hold my donkey milk shake."
Monfils how can you not atleast win one match after 20 smh
GMP is a monster!
Damn Novak is hitting some CLEAN shots
Imagine a final between Opelka & Mpetschi - Perricard ?!?!
Perrycard upgrades himself from last year version. He hits the ball faster, cleaner and not making too many unforced errors. He, with Fils, will soon enter top 10. Medvedev and Rublev shall drop out.  Funny: Perrycard and Tiafoe seem to shop at the same fashion store.
Giovanni non è un giocatore completo??????ma stiamo scherzando....ma veramente....?mmahh
Novak has always been too athletic for Monfils with his quickness in court coverage, conditioning & shot making‼Oh yeah - his mind as well‼🤔
GMP love this kids game. Cant wait to see him in a full season
Novak is hungry for the 25th Slam
GMP's strokes oddly have the same explosion and ball shape as Fed. Dude looks legit.
i was so lucky to see these live in person loved it
With the new guys coming up I fear Tiafoes' days in the Top 20 getting 1st round byes, are numbered. And for Frances, that will pose a problem.
Djokovic 20-0 Monfils in their H2H now, that is so one sided 😂
Mpetshi triggers a lot of fear.
Djokovic hasn’t faced anyone that will push him yet, he’ll struggle when it starts getting more physical.
Can't wait for Sinner to make Mpetshi look like an average player 😆 No matter how you guys want to call it... Take away his serve and he's not even a top 50 player... Couldn't break against a handicapped Kyrgios who literally just returned on Tour...  And before you nerds are going to start hating: I hope he becomes world #1 at some point. I wish him nothing but the best.
Perricard is the future!!!!
Opelka is on 🔥
What's the gretaest record: 25 GS or beating the same top 100 guy 20 times?  Monfils had lost the game the moment he learnt who he had to play against 😂
Let's go No1e!!! Win Brisbane and #25 AO 🇷🇸🇷🇸🇷🇸
Aa .
Was Opelka injured for the past year? I have been wondering why he disappeared.
MP is so awesome!  Love this  matchup.  Two strong hitters dueling.  Both brought guns to a knife fight!  💪🏽 💪🏽
RIGGED
Perricard has great genetics for tennis.
I'm sure Monfils will beat Djokovic, and when that happens then Vitas, sorry I meant Gael, will say "Nobody can beat Gael Monfils 64 times in a row"
Best server of active players (Mpetshi Perricard) vs greatest returner of all time (Nole) sounds like a great match next round!
you may have won this round again Novak!, but mark my words nobody beats Gael Monfils 21x times in a row.
Showman Tiafo got smashed again?
Why they look like teammates 4:17 😂
Excited to see what mvp perricard and Djogoatovic can achieve in Autralian Open.
4:42 Mpetshi goes full Federer
6:30 Roger's like return
Opelka found his inspiration in Cast Away?
GMP is going to be in the top 5, the way he is improving.
C'est moi ou Gio a progressé de dingue en quelque mois ? Il avait que du service, là on dirait un autre homme .
The same outfit by Nike is so cheap.
Mpeshi looks phenomenal
Tiafoe didn't saw anything lazy player and perricard power shoots are lethality other then that nothing impressive.
Perricard is mr tiebreaker
Veo a nole muy rápido 😮
Serve bot Opelka wins 2 matches in a row 😮
If perricard and players who play like him are the future then the sport is gonna die. Boring!
Opelka, 27. Looks like he’s around 40. 😅
Wow perriecard has one handed backhand
몽피스 좋아하는 선순데 조코비치한테는 진짜 너무 약하네요 물론 조코비치가 잘하니 어쩔수 없긴하지만 아쉽네요
These guys don't seem to realize that by attacking Perricard's backhand all the time they are just making it stronger by the minute. Dude is a star in the making. I like him a lot.
Djokovic H2H with Monfils is 20:0. How is that even possible?
Anyone calling GMP a serve bot has no brains
I wanna see GMP vs Opelka. Giant great movers!
Looks like it is possible to beat gael monfils 20 times in a row…
Nice to see Opelks get a win, he's been so injured so far in his career. Wishing him an injury free season
Mpetish is and will be a problem for top 10 players. Immense serve and forehand..reminds me of Del Potro but with more agility and mobility.
GMP is no joke that serve and backhand are scary good. Saw him last season and was like 'oh... if dude stays uninjured, he'll be doing big things next year" Love watching the whip action he gets on his backhand
6:29 GMP did he return with a doublehand backhand
Imagine an GMP and Opelka match!! Two serve bots going at it!!! is gonna be 🔥🔥🔥
Pteshi Perricard is no joke
Tiafoe got to fix that weak ass second serve!
Nick Kyrgios played way better than Foe!!!! That means Nick is a top 20 player ATM
Mpetshi Perricard has everything to go right to the top
Perricard is a BEAST!
Didn't he retire?
Tiafoe only won 50% of points behind second serve, as Giovanni attacks it. Important to serve with high percentage against him.
Djokovic looks sharp and happy it will be fun to see what he can do in Melbourne
giovanni's game is huge, i excpect him to hit a slam soon. though it will probably be at wimbledon or us open, cause of the faster surfaces
mpetshi’s movement looked extremely crisp this match
nice to have a serve which gurantee you to win even if your oppo can play better tennis in every other part of the game (opelka)
M-Perricard looks more like a bodybuilder than a tennis player. Has gained some muscles in a few months.
Im surprised Monfils hasn't beaten Novak on Clay at least once smh
4:28 this will easily make Wawrinka proud 🫡
I have never seen a player clapping his opponent's winning points as often as Djokovic. He always gives credit when you do something nice.
Monfils will get that win against Đoković... When they both end they career and play exhibition match...
The GOAT is in the house. 🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤
Djokovic is clearly the GOAT yet everyone would still rather play like Federer if given the chance. Pisses me off!
He always holds serve and wins the tiebreak. He's Karlovic.
Djokovic looks very sharp. Tennis world.. watch out, the goat is coming! 🐐🔥
For those who always say that Mpetshi just has a serve😂 he is a totally complete player
no one beat Le Monf 21 times in a row !! Alle Gael , you got him next time !
Millman the cheater!
The GOAT Novak Djokovic doing GOAT things 🐐👑🏅🙌
LET'S GOOOOOO NOLEEEEEEEEE 🐐👑🏅🙌
GMP is a force to be reckoned with - Kyrgios, Tiafoe.. wow!
Poor Monfils
Gaël just can't get a win in 20 encounters
In the last 2 years, Djokovic has equaled the power and accuracy of his forehand with his backhand! He is playing better and better at the net! In addition, this year he is completely healthy, not playing on one leg, and his movement is incredible, like a 25-year-old! The excited fans of Sinner and the sick of Fedals will probably cry, there will be pain...
Giovanni's forehand is scary asf!!!
let’s go mpetshi perricard!!
Monfils will be 39 in 8 months from now. I don’t see him playing past 2025.
why do tiafoe and mpetshi always wear the same clothes😂
Novak looks so sharp this year compare to 2024 where he certainly felt tired after that insane 2023 season ! he has rest and now will be very motivated for a 25GS in his garden in melbourne
Let’s go Nole!!! 20-0 against monfils is insane! Hopefully 25th grand slam win
