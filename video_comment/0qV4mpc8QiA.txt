My favorite killer Michael myers the bogeyman can’t wait to play
🥱🥱
👌👌
I wonder if Laurie strode will be able to be playable or called in like Tommy Jarvis in the Friday the 13th game
I absolutely LOVED Friday the 13th and still play it offline. I'm so pumped for this game and thank you for including a single player mode.
That attempt at sound like  Dr Loomis was pretty bad a laughable.   The character animations looked pretty bad too.   But I like what they're aiming for.   And of course the music is timeless.
Can’t wait to see you when they cut support for this game too let’s let the Michael Myers fans. Feel the Jason’s fans pain. Please just remake Friday the 13th and don’t shut it down this time.
Please be a single player FIRST. I know I shouldn't have faith on Gun...
Please make it approved by John carpenter so it doesn't happen the same as Friday the 13th the game
Omg everyone! Its "The Shape" stop saying "Michael Myers". The shape is the personification!!! The horror!
Wooow cool
I hope this is an exact clone of the Friday the 13th game.
Update tcm please
I'm going to go out on a limb and say the old man in the house at the end is actually Dick Warlock.
Anyone notice the ghost hanging on the porch of the first yellow house has glasses painted on like how michael looked wearing the sheet pretending to be Bob
What sucks about this is that it's not going to be for ps4. I cant afford buying a ps5
italiani siamo gia in hypeeeeee
Why his head look too big for his body?
I'm just hoping these guys got permission to make this game. I don't really want to see a future game like this get ruined by a lawsuit. Hopefully, they won't immediately move on to the next thing after they make this since I can imagine a game like this could last a long time if they give it the attention it would need. I am definitely hyped about this though. 😁
I really hope they make the gameplay will be like hit man so you play a Michael Myers and sneak into houses using tools in your surroundings to kill the players and you have the ability to break down doors and walls and if you’re a survivor you have the ability to crawl through tiny spaces use guns and use hide outs and traps and I hope this isn’t another dead by daylight knock off like the other horror games are like… damn it’s a Friday the 13th game rip off😭
Man i wanted the Jason game, but was too late
Horrible voice, you could’ve done waaaay better.
seems like a game which survives 6 Months after an End of Life Support.
Idk how Michael looks in the game..or how he walks
Looks great !
Anyone notice the body dangling out the window of the house the girl runs out of??
Hell yeahh❤❤❤❤
ima buy ps plus to buy it on ps5
Just hearing the score gives me goosebumps, still one of the best scores ever made.
1:24 Listen, and understand! That Boogeyman is out there! It can't be bargained with, it can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop... ever, until you are dead!
Please put Michael Myers in the mobil game is Halloween
our news friday the 13th
M16 rifle would easily stop him.
Switch 2 port?
The legend himself john carpenter is back
Will it be on Xbox?
1:33 ngl bro look like a teenager
Add some kind of cameo referencing George Wilbur, Donald Pleasence, and the other actor's we've lost as a tribute.
Make the survivors more alive the thing that’s good about Friday the thirteenth and tcm is the characters have animation to them killer clowns didn’t and it took the immersive feeling out so please make sure they have better voice lines and you can tell when they are scared other then the screen being gray
Just a reminder that Gun's Friday the 13th game was killed less than a decade after its release and is no longer playable, outside of unofficial fan builds, which Gun are actively trying to shut down. This game is going to die, too. Both of these games are based on franchises that are over 40 years old. If the same business practices were applied to the films, most of them would not be watchable anymore. Don't support companies that kill their games. Don't waste your money.
i just want a singleplayer linear Halloween game experience for once , please!
we are so back
I was hyped until I saw Micheal's model. Like dude.
Here's hopping Freddy of Nightmare on Elm Street and Chucky of Child's Play are given video games of this standard.
voice over for Dr. Loomis (I'm guessing) is pretty bad.  It sounds like an American trying to do an English accent but ending up a mix of accents
Honestly I would have prefered a Freddy Krueger game instead
What console will this be on or is it only PC?
It's crazy. I can't wait,  I love michael myers
A single player Halloween game will be very spooky especially if you playing it at night.
How long fo think this will last before it ends up like the Friday the 13th game...
Are we gonna get different style Michael Myers like we did in Friday the 13th? Each movie had a more Distinct look.
Michaels Myers. OG of movie serial killers
Published by gun....so they are going to kill another ip
Love that carpenter is doing production here
Imagine a fight between Michael and Bughuul (The villain from Sinister 1 & 2)   to settle who truly is ... THE BOOGYMAN!
Tutorial Level should be Michael escaping the madhouse.  Easter eggs should be glimpses into the past with him as a kid, killing things.
6 billion people on this planet and they couldn't' have found a better Loomis voice.
Oh no Gun interactive is involved the game will be dead within a year guaranteed👍🏻
Plsss be on the ps4 😢
1:29 well said from Dr Loomis
Lets goo friday the 13th game 2.0
I can't wait
I enjoyed this trailer, very well made 👌🏼
que bosta
if you play as michael myers in this game it is just trying to teach kids to be school shooters!!!
I really like Halloween movies
If its similar style as destroy all humans, thatd be awesome.
the voice over ruins this trailer sounds so flat
The New Halloween Michael Myers Game Looks Awesome 😎 🎃🔪🎃🔪🎃🔪🎃
Finally a Halloween game and it's on Xbox too
The only way this game would be fun and scary would be to copy the formula from Alien Isolation IMO.
Ilfonic and Gun Media, are you going to screw up this game too? Are you going to ruin this one too?
Don't create new games like Friday the 13th, just bring back Friday the 13th!
Why his body petite
Gun Interactive is an awful publisher. They screwed up Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw, and I'm going to guess this is next. Hard pass.
John wick where ya at?
Make a Outlast style single player game with a famouse classic character and you will print money
We becoming better than Jason with this one🗣️🔥
This will be the same crap like all his game. Friday the 13th? We remember
I was on the fence about this until I saw: single player
Gun Interactive LOL
The voice actor fuckin sucks he sounds like your science teacher trying to read a script for a elementary school play
After their treatment of the texas chainsaw game I'm a little hesitant to buy into this tbh
That music though.
Im hype for This game more than for GTA VI🔥
Fool me once: Friday the 13th the game Fool me twice: Texas Chain Saw Massacre the game Never be fooled again: Halloween the game
This whole franchise could have been avoided if they'd just call in Mr. Wick. Just saying.
the mask looks too chubby and his body is smaller it just doesnt look right this is quite bad for 2025 capabilities, anyone agree i just think a game this anticipated could have had more pride took on the main character ATLEAST
It’s F13 all over again tbh. Just never give illfonic or gun a cent again. And hope that someone competent and passionate about the franchise gets the licensing rights someday.
Oh my gosh people... let it gooo
chave
With Gun and Illfonic at the helm, this will be dead in a couple years, after the cash has been grabbed.
Do we get to play as Michael myers
I can't wait
"I saw him, the shape"
I'm sure Donald Pleasence's family wouldn't object to using his voice through AI in the game. If you're gonna Halloween, do it properly.
I’m going to cry happy tiers 😢
1:24  my favorite part
That looks cool af
I have a bad feeling about this. The animations are so bad, the graphics are bad, GunMedia is involved, no gameplay, just the iconic musics but that’s it. I give this game two years of existence, they’ll close the servers in a blink of an eye 😂
Cool❤
Please dont be sh......
I want to play it
Looks like shit. Boring trailer. Animation look like a 5 year old did it. Showed nothing.
John which is the buggy man hunter
All the slobs who praise AC Shadows are the ones who got it for free or through ubisoft subscription. Still not worth the originally planned eighty USD.   Insult the haters all you want, without them you would have had to pay another 60 USD to even sniff this DLC. You should thank them for forcing Ubislop to give you all discounts.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
i looked deeper into it and its a re skin of the Friday the 13th game that flopped. Single player or not these type of games are overshadowed by dead by daylight. Goodluck getting a player base for this crap
That Dr.Loomis voice is truly terrible.
Work faster! I need to pre-order!
whoever made the soundtrack for this already deserves a raise
I wonder if this will be any different from the other 3rd person horror games like Texas Chainsaw and DBD. If it's the same tired game mechanics again with a new license I'm not interested.
As so long as gun media doesn't make it I'm in.
No way youtube just hid this from me for 3 weeks...
Yes always wanted to play a game where I’m Michael Myers!
Fan made?
Is the gameplay just running in fear?
The blackest eyes... the devil's eyes... purely and simply... evil.
Shut up and take my money
I can't wait for this game to come out. I'm buying it
15 years 😶🫥
I'm so hyped for this. 🫣
the narration is horrible. If they going for a Donald Pleasence they failed. Get better actor and Re Dub it.
The idea sounds fun but Gun is making this and it already looks cheesy
All these games should have focused on single player with online being secondary element. Also this narrator sucks absolute balls
They’re gonna let you play it for a little while then they’re gonna pull the plug like how they did it on Friday the 13th
Buying
Oh my gawsh…….🫢🤪🥶🥶🥶I want it I want it I want it.🤲🤲🤲
I hope they improve the graphics and character movement. The character design and movement is underwhelming
Texas chainsaw game was lit too, shit went trash cause nothing was happening. Hope this is a dope game
I'm happy that I'm making the game but I feel like they could have done more I want that scary affect I want to feel like Michael Myers is a threat like in the movie so hopefully they can pull it off I don't want the screen to be too bright where it makes it easy to see Michael coming from like a mile away I prefer that dark scene where it gives me that fear you know like a little fast heartbeat scare
Goofy ahh animation style
Remembers the Friday the 13th game and flinches
Ahhh wrong dev team definitely. Game will be dead in a few years from launch just like any other they made 🥴
Masacre de Texas 2.0??  🫠🫠🫠😖😖😖
Are we finally entering a golden era of horror movie single player games? I fuckin' hope so
That voice-over was pretty rough. Did they not have any actors? LoL
I haven’t been this excited for a game in a long time.
Yes finally Halloween game none of u know how excited I am for this game
I’m hoping the single player is story based like the movies where while he is hunting you you’re trying to solve clues and trying to stop him and not like F13 where you just trying to make it to a checkpoint to escape him.  Halloween movie had a story to it (before the remakes) which was he was going after his bloodline, and anyone in the way would get it. While F13 was more of a everybody is gunna get it
this could be so fantastic like man....... the cameras
Lmao guns gonna release this game then give up on it right away like they always do. These people were so slow they made a Friday the 13th game & got sued because they didn’t have the license. Don’t even get me started on TCM either… RIP both those games. You cant make this stuff up.😂😂😂
Hope there will actually be a storyline. Just playing to survive or kill gets old fast. 🎃
Let me guess. You play as the killer and hunt down teens.  So, dead by daylight? Texas chainsaw?  Friday the 13th?  Its great how easily you can see the sheep by the games they play 😂
Looks like a flop of a game.
hopefully it will remind us of friday the 13th game.. it was a classic.
Lame
Good
Just wait till we get The Thing video game. Mature Among US
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
Friggin’ heck ya! I’m in!
Are we playing as the survivors or as Michael? I'm interested in this
Lobby of 50 Michael Meyers just stabbing it out. 😂
Just don't abandon this one like you did Friday the 13th!!!! Still mad about that.
Hell ya
Yay single player!!!
bro this better be stop motion wtf are these animations man, solo dev i guess
LETS GO!!!!
Yikes … this looks … well hopefully they have time to polish it 😅🎃
Michael Myers I s Back?!
Halloween for some reason means alot to me. It's the first real slasher I've ever watched and I was just so enamored by the aesthetics, Carpenters soundtrack, Myers himself. So happy this is getting a game Friday the 13th style
Im so mf excited for dis game they finally makin a Halloween game I love Jason & Michael
Где студия Gun я игру не куплю хватило Техасскую резню сами теперь играйте в свои помойки
So glad it’s not another day by daylight clone. At least I hope it’s not.
what platform will this be on.
Why they got Dr Loomis sounding like he’s reading in a shitty accent!?
3rd times a charm ay
CAN NOT WAIT.
Hope this game lives up to the original movie but judging by the Dr lumps voice acting I’m not so sure
2025😂😂😂 2021☠️☠️☠️
❤❤❤❤ yes
🎉🎉🎉
Absolutely terrible trailer🤦‍♂️
Yeeesssssss! Can’t wait for it to lose support after it’s been out for a few months.
burger king Myers😆
Friday the 13th was seriously something!!! This best better be worth the time cuz a  Halloween game is something weve been waiting for a long time afrer the release of Friday The 13th
I hope yall learned
That voice over for the psychologist dude sounds terrible. Jheeze I would've sounded better
This looks fire
A trailer for a Pinhead video game came out and now for a Michael Myers one!? Whats next? A Freddy Krueger video game?
will this game have tombstone? lol
They need A Nightmare on Elm Street next
How else will be pissed if this is another Friday the 13th situation in the future?
Uh oh gun media and Illfonic? It’ll last a year, get dumb skins then they’ll stop support
glad there’s single player so the dbd sweats have to stay to their own crappy game instead of trying to ruin another good upcoming title
Do we get to play as Michael?
that voice sounds nothing like Doctor Loomis
Just run. He can't run.
Just let me kill teenagers as michael myers
looks bad 😢
Omg I can’t believe this is happening, I watched these movies as a kid and now a game? Thank you Lord 😂😂
Feminism killed Michael Myers.
The voice for Loomis feels a bit off, but he has the right intensity.
FIREEEEEE!!!!
I hope n pray its not another dead by daylight an actual story would be nice or something like that survival plus campaign
As awesome as this looks, why can’t they ever get the mask right? I’ve yet to see a Halloween video game where the mask looked screen accurate. I mean, you go to all this effort to detail everything right down to the original pumpkin but can’t get the mask right? Doesn’t seem like a hard ask.
Jesus, wtf is this goofy as bullshit? Sounds like it was repriced on a phone
Man, I was so pleased it wasn't "another" film!!! I was just about to moan out a huge paragraph on "how many of these do they have to make" 😂😂
RELEASE IT NOOOOOOOOWWWWW 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
i dont see this ever being released
Illfonic is really, really bad news here and I say this as somebody who has played F13 and Predator Hunting Grounds.
Hands down the worst narrating voice of Loomis, I have heard. It sounds like a 16 year old.
I'm getting scared 😲😳😢😅😂🎉🎉❤❤
Shu hadda ?
For some reason I get The Sims vibes 😅
How dare you release a halloween game trailer one month before halloween and it doesn't drop til next year😭😭😭
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thank god it ain't an asymmetrical DBD alike shite!
IM SO EXCITED.
Developer: IllFonic Publisher: Gun Interactive Creator: John Carpenter Production Partners: Compass International Pictures and Further Front Technology: Unreal Engine 5 It’s gonna be good.
My prediction has come!! I made a comment about a game that focuses on Michael Myers  6 years ago!!
Give him wider clavicles
When can we expect a release date. I really want this. Halloween is some of carpenters finest work.   Anytime before gta6 and requiem would be great.
This whole trailer feels like it’s made by A.i
Hey Lonnie...get your ass away from there!!!!
Crazy af how scary this trailer is
Character movement looks janky af. PS1 standards
oh my god
I really hope this is like until dawn or the quarry. Regardless I’m hyped
A flop but watch so many buy this 💀💀😊
Graphics look too cartoonish 🤦🏻‍♂️ I want realistic
you gon’ let me do my motherf*ckin dance 🕺🏾
So this isn't a dead by daylight clone!?
It's still nuts to me that this is actually happening..
The Narration runes it
Is it coming out next year ?
Si está gun mejor mierda amiga no quiero que termine como TCM o no le den las decisiones a gun ni el derecho a opinar
I pooped my pants
let caseoh play this..
This looks more like a sims dlc than a standalone game
I first thought it was a stop motion movie, movement kinda looks bad :/. And Michael walks silly
I want to see actual gameplay before I get excited about it.
Knew this was coming lol. Michael Myers is the best slasher 😁
Hoping this is Alien Isolation ish. That would be truly epic/terrifying
Graphic is very good
Lets go Man
You guys did a really good job with this game like I'm not going to lie me and my uncle says it looks just like the movie we are a really big fan of Michael Myers so we are excited to experience this game
🗡🎃🎃🎃🎮🕹🎃🎃🎃🔪 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🍷🗿
This game sounds amazing
I bet we can moonwalk with Michael like in Dead by Daylight 😂
SINGLE PLAYER?! OH YEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
Oh nooo this looks terrible
0 gameplay image...
One person can???.....Jason???
F13 Successor??!    WE BACK BOIZ!! 🙏🙌
Para que lo veo de noche y solo 😂
Chills
Enough already please 👎🏻
It's cloudy outside, with a chance of Checks for mr. Carpenter 💰💰💰
*hope this game doesn't FAIL like the other  one* 🤔🤔
I would love for another jigsaw video game.
Sam loomis AI is terrible.
Oh hell yea
Just stop trying to compete with dbd man u already lost before u even start
So is this gonna be worked on by the devs for less than 2 years and also be abandoned like Texas Chainsaw?
I have played or bought a video game in many years but this might change that. It's PC right? That's the only thing I've never played a game on
And they will drop support for the games within 2 years like they did for all their games.
There’s no blood on his knife or hands and he supposedly just killed someone? How does no one think of these things before releasing this.
Cheap graphics.👎
Thank god there’s a single player option!! I had to delete TCM because I’d be waiting forever in an empty lobby only to be kicked 4 times before getting to play with people who just stand there and do nothing
Do we play as Michael?
Ts was not in the gamescom😭😭😭🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
This will be another cash grab folks 😂 dont fall for it. Worst studio and publisher out there. Be aware
Let Donald rest in peace stop taking shit ffs
That was bad Illfonic again? They messed up friday the 13th and predator hunting grounds Why do olny these cheap wannabes get the licenses? Nah im done
Long overdue
micheal looks like shit
looks shit
i dreamt of this lmao
This game better not get deleted like friday did
“I shot’em six times!”   “I said I SHOT’EM SIX TIMES!”  “HE’S NOT HUMAN!”
We need a Freddy Krueger game!
Just tell me we get to play as Dr Loomis and have the gun
Sick
Many peoole have been arguing that horror movies are in dead by daylight but they made a single player horror game
Just call The Judge, Jury, Executioner
Haha
GUN is trashhhhh
Finally! We're getting a Halloween game. Now we need a Nightmare on Elm Street game. Like this comment if you agree. Let's get the devs to deliver.
You can't kill the Boogeyman !
mmm... I'd love this to be good, but take a look at the original film, the colour grading, the movement of michael.. don't ruin it... michael's mask doesn't look great in this trailer
doesn't sound anything like dear old Donald !  😮
Pretty pretty PRETTY please release on the Quest 3. Thank you.
Thank God his mask doesn’t look so fucked like dead by daylight
We really needed a terrible Don Pleasance impression?
I can’t wait to play this 🔥
I still don’t understand how a person can make such a good film and immediately destroy it with a franchise that doesn’t make sense. Lori is not Michael’s sister people!! Such a mistake on Carpenters part.
oh boy cant wait for them to also shut this game down  after one year gun ur a scam
That lady running is some of the worst video game animation I've ever seen. That movement was so wooden. This game is going to be straight up ass.
1:39 ALREADY 10x better than Halloween Ends😂
0:12 ICONIC music Drop❤ RIP Donald and all we lost
This is the goofiest horror game narration and trailer i have seen
I really thought this was gonna be some dbd but hey
Looks like a crappier version of ded by daylight lmao😂
holy fuk another remake.  jeeezus
AI voice is terrible
They never show on tv Halloween 5 for free it's getting old
His head is too big......
THE shape.........THE BOOGEYMAN.................THE EVIL...........................but it already has a name..............................MICHAEL Myers🎃🎃🎃🎃🔪🔪🔪🔪
Coolest thing I’ve ever seen in my entire life!
Is this a game?
No wonder Hollywood is making stupid shit, people are excited for stupid shit.
Will this be kinda like Alien - Isolation, where you gotta have to hide and sneak away?
This is stupid. How can you make chasing one person into a video game?
So they kill Jason to make Halloween all right
No you cant im Michael Myers we never die
Corny unfortunately.
Ign is disgusting
That Loomis ain’t cutting it lol. It sounds like a 30 something trying to age up.
please don't mess this up
Now imagine playing a Scream game. That would be a pure joy
The Sims: Halloween
Looks soooo awesome!!!! 😍❤️🥰
Made me miss Friday The 13th and Texas Chainsaw (which is still playable but sort of dead already too) 😭
Voice is 💩 Game looks 💩
Looks as cheap and rushed as the Friday the 13th game. Even the cut scenes look clunky af
Singleplayer sounds promising, but with there being multiplayer I'll be mad if this is just another Dead By Daylight clone.
thry took jason away sadly i hope this is good like that and not another dead by daylight or TCSM
Cool ❤
When your video game trailer has 0% of the video game shown in it, it should at least be a little harder to tell right away that it will be dog shit. Could never ever compare to the amazing Friday the 13th game that now just sadly takes up storage cause I love it too much to uninstall
Rotfl😂 they said if we can’t make anymore movies we’ll make a video game
Let’s go!!!!!!!!
terrible animations
🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
Another scam
Michael Jackson? No, Michael Myers!
Looks like Jamie Olive
Miss the voice of Donald Pleasence
0:59
Is that ps2? That shit looks ugly.
Let’s go! Finally.
I hope its not as bad as the friday the 13th game!
I like the ghost ornament with the glasses. Nice reference
The Halloween theme song never gets old
hype hype hype
Character Animation KILLED it for me.
Oh Goody, We Have To Wait A Whole nother Round of Seasons before we can play this one.  Whether they meant to do so or not the biggest trick played on us was (with us being Only A Single Month Out) This was gonna be A Halloween Treat for This Year.
already pre ordered in the future see you guys in Haddonfield
they cant compete with dead by daylight..
Would like to know how it’s it going to work. Mission based? Are you Micheal or are you the victim? Open world? Can you kill just anybody or only who the game tells you? What is the objective of the game? To get to Laurie or somebody else?
Finally YESSSS I was waiting for it since 1991 :D
Please please PLEASE be like Friday the 13th!!! I loved the idea of trying to escape by working with others like repairing a car to escape or repairing a boat to escape. Or even the potential ending of working together to kill Michael Myers would be so exciting.
Hopefully it has single player where you can play as Micheal Myers or victim as well as a online lobby much like Friday The 13th.
Wow the narrators voice is so obviously a young dude doing the world's worst old man impression 😂 voice acting is a -700
Gun esta detrás del juego, 4 meses de vida tendrá el juego
Good grief ANOTHER remake of a game an Indie company believe already made………like….can we start being creative? I get it there’s only Nepo babies at the work force, but damn do SOMETHING….this is just sad…….
sooooooo dbd?
Are they going to make games like this for every horror franchise out there? Games that'll last max 2 years before they're no longer supported? I don't get it.
Wow!
LFG WISH MOM WAS HERE JUST PLAYED ALONG WITH 🎹🥁🥁🎸🎸🖤🖤🖤🔪🔪 THIS WAS HER FAV
Just please don't pull a Rockstar with multiple delays and pushbacks. If so please just keep the date/s to yourselves until you all know it's official
Ugh 2026?! Nooo
Doesn’t look great..
Nobody buys a Halloween game hoping to play as some teenager. Let me be Micheal, let me slash up haddonfield, and make it single player, and you got a damn good game.
Gun.
the animation wasn't good. this is a game no one asked for. hopefully, they make improvements to it before release. need better animation
So they cut off friday the 13th to give us Halloween? 🤯im for it
The vibes of this seem perfect. The Donald Pleasance impersonation was terrible lol
This looks trash 😂
when is the release date?
1:30 tufffffff
2026 ? lol
The Score: 10/10 The Janky Animations: 0.5/10
Can’t wait for that game to come out
FINALLYYYY
Hopefully the third time's the charm for Gun and Illfonic. F13 was an absolute banger but they got unlucky with the lawsuit. TCM was mediocre at best. Praying this one lasts.
A Game with an Ai chasing you along the story like the Xenomorph Ai would be awesome. Play as Michael would be as good as being chasing by him too
So thissss is how I upgrade my outdated Xbox One. 🤔
They should recruit Michael Meyers into the military and drop him into an enemy territory. 😂
They gotta fix Loomis before this releases. That's a Sanic the Hoghedge bad impression.
This is definitely gunna flop, I wanna be optimistic but it’s just not happening
If they make a Jeepers Creepers Game it’s over 💯
Bro when i saw "halloween official announcement" i was like. How many times they gonna bring this mf back he literally got crushed to peices. Then i saw it was a game😂
Take my money
We need nightmare on elmstreet
Hoping it’s like roboCop. !!!
Honest question how do you beat the game if he never (you know what) lol
The music alone made me want to watch the movie 😂😂😂
I’m from the same city that Gun Interactive is from (Lexington, Kentucky,) and as soon as that logo popped up, my heart immediately sank. This game isn’t gonna get the love and support it needs, and will probably be abandoned come 2027 or so.
They should do one with all the killers Imagine playing ad Chucky 😱
wow amazing incredible, like the Dr. Loomis voice this game is mulit player too. Also another Jason game coming out too as well. can't wait looks like it's off the chain. the only thing is we need reboot but with Myers younger. I would like to see them remake it all over but way better on how he heard voices in his house from a wealthy family house and he turn into the Boogyman.
Olha essa trilha sonora impecavel
Is this for real?
Made by gun no ty
Made by Gun, this game is already dead lol.
Please for the love of heaven,  make this game legit, already the running was horrible lol, i know its not finished,  but make this a masterpiece John
Watching this scared me
The fact that this game will die like Friday the 13th and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre...
Love this but woudont it have made sense to try to get it ready by idk…Halloween   Can’t wait though !
Look to see the game get pulled after two years like every other Gun & Illfonica games.
Please put more development in the fucking single player guys please 🙏 I just want a GOOD single player Halloween game. The multiplayer will phase out, that story mode could be monumental and warrant you guys a sequel if it’s good enough 😭🙏🙏🙏
This game gonna be a million times better than Friday The 13th just like the movies 😂
They be better let us play as Michael
Is that voice fking Ai???? 😭
This time we won't lose the license in 2 years, we promise!
I really want to love this, as a fan of the series, but the narrator's voice just...I dunno....Nah.
Just completed it, its great!
First Friday the 13th, then The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and finally Halloween. They should do a crossover 😆
FINALLY i waited 25 years for a Decent Halloween Game !!!
the person who narrated this sounds awful
Terrible animation lol
Anyone else shit themselves when the theme song came on I had my speakers on loud! Can't wait for the Halloween game to come out next year it looks brilliant! 😁🎃
i scurr easy.
why does Michael look like he's on ozempic 💔
New best friend  / from Jason Gillespie
🎃🔪 *dun-dun-dun-dun*
Not coming on switch?
Yes looks good ,but how long will this game last b4 it goes the same way as friday 13 or texas chainsaw  thats the only thing putting me off buying
The narrator did a fantastic job on this. Bravo!
Wtf is this? Can't be unreal engine 5...assets look terrible 😆🤣
Its so bad it’s hilarious 😂
So is this going to be like the Friday the 13 game?
Homeboy been walking in slow motion for decades.
Loomis voiceover is garbage
Lame
DBD: nah i'd update him
Now give us a scream game similar to f13/tcm bruh we deserve a real game that’s good, It should have multiplayer even though I hate f13’s community, nobody took it serious
I think it will be very nice
Where are the iconic Musik from the nientest
I saw illfonic and i got pissed. The ball they dropped with arcadegeddon's shitty servers and fake cross platform/progression is so disappointing.
This is why they gave up on Texas chainsaw lol… no more future updates for that game I guess.. and that game was very unique it’s sad they stopped on it
This is a day one I can't wait to play as Michael Myers day one asap
The boogeyman
I really just hope they give us a chance to play in the hospital as a bonus level
Finalmente né 🖤
i hope this game is not like dead by daylight, i mean we have Texas chainsaw never played this now, friday the 13. never play this now... and and and.
So awesome we can have a single player experience!!!💯💯after dead by daylight to have single player experience and multiplayer yessssss!!!💯💯
It's a shame such powerful horror icons get treated with the same DBD type formula.
So we know Michael will be playable in the asymmetrical multiplayer, but will be be playable in the single player? Cus call me a psycho, idk, but I’d love to be able to play as Myers and just go on a murderous rampage in Haddonfield.
Hopefully GUN doesn't ruin this with broken characters like Danny. If they keep the speedrun/stunlock gods playing victim balanced in this game unlike TCM it has a chance. Open door, go in well, open door, go in well, teammates stunlock, teammates stunlock, open door, teammates stunlock, go in well. Lets see what this has.
Ohh o can’t wait to play this game it look awesome
Who keeps making this shit????
MEU DEUSSS
The scarier thing than the game itself is seeing gun interactive show up
Bro Hellraiser revelations now this?? I'm having a party! 😭🤯
I shouldn’t have watched this in the dark alone in my old house. 😢
This game better be an uncensored and terrifying thrill ride.
Bru they better kick gun to the grave they aint no good I ain't gonna spend another 60 dollars on a game if it's gonna be dead two years after it's release
Actually,  John Wick can kill the Boogeyman.
It's actually supposed to be a card game, similar to Gwent. I have high hopes.
This game is DOA, nuff said.
Like the sound track, and trailer but Donald Pleasances voice could have been done better.
Narrator sounds close to Donald Pleasence.
Michael Myers (aka) The Shape is the only killer I'm scared of in DBD 😮
I0I could make a great Halloween game
No ps4?? Ofc... wanna also see the gameplay , i also do like Michael's model and the mask!!!
As a veteran of Illfonics killer klowns from outer space the game. I can confirm that this game is going to be insanely identical to the movie Halloween.
I’ve said it time and time again they need to make a game for him and it’s finally happening can’t wait 🗣️💯
I'm super excited
FINAL FUCKING LY
The hype I had till I saw the gun logo...fml 😭
Why is she running as though she's wearing an uncomfortable tampon
wow this sure is exciting, i can't wait for the multiplayer to fizzle out and die within three to two months!
Hope it is more like Friday the 13th the game than TCM the game!
That run Though.....💙
From the shitties least trustworthy company out there that abandons its games after 1-2 years. No thank you
The boogy man  John wick 😅
Why does Michael look like a bobble head?  🤣🤣
Singleplayer? Finally I can become a murder without having to pay subscription just to play online
I miss having people to play with on F13. That game was so fun.
Ehh doesn't look too exciting. Maybe if the animations were more realistic
Now we need a Chucky and Saw game 🤌🏽
Tellement hâte que le jeu sorte j'espère qu'il tiendra plus longtemps que Vendredi 13 the game et Texas chainsaw massacre the game.
I can't fucking wait!!! 💯
The Animation is Mid but you can tell you will be playing as Michael
This does look good and it is great that there is a single player mode. The only thing I would say, would be I hope that they improve the NPC‘s. The ones in the Friday the 13th game we’re a little too cartoonish.
I haven't played a video game in sooo long... I'm coming out of retirement!
Looks great but why can nothing or no one ever ever get Michael’s movements or walk right? It’s the same thing with most of the movies after the original. They always give him this annoying gangster like swag in his walk. He’s supposed to have this emotionless robotronic walk. James Jude Courtney got that right at least in the newest trilogy.
I hope you play as Micheal Myers
This is probably gonna be another dead by daylight trash game with no actual story that feels nothing like the movie
About time
The night he came home 🎃🔪
Should be Interesting
That's the worst Loomis attempt I've ever heard
Thyre going to get sued and shut down like Friday did 😂
Looks cheap
I wish it was a 1v7 online like Friday the 13th
2026 is crazy honestly looks like dead by daylight
It’s about time 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 let’s go Mike 🔪
illfonic, probably another game that's instantly DOA
lol
You can’t kill the boogeyman… but LeBron James could 360 dunk on his ass
holycrapholycrapholycrapholycrapholycrapholycrapholycrapholycrapholycrapholycrapholycrap its a game cool
I hope The Game will dies as soon as possible in The context of what they did with TTCM :)
yall need different producers for these types of games man that shid looks choppy asl and why i have a feeling its gon be like the friday the 13 game where ur running away and there someone playing as myers and yall should make one where u can free roam care for your game a little more
The model is not looking good, his head is too big and he got no shoulders and wtf are those Mario looking legs? ( C'mon man don't do Michael this way. )
After all these decades it's still be best slasher pic ever made.
We need a nightmare on elm street that you can create your own character. With the same I level of details as some of these fantasy games
This better not be Dead By Daylight….
❤ Michael myers🔪
Yeeeah finally a real Michael Myes game no they put Michael Myes skin in other games
i hope they do keep that single player mode and not change their mind about it
Finally. Great job can’t wait
If only they could bring an IT (Pennywise the clown) game out but it would be to controversial eating kids and stuff 😂
The Sims 2 had better animation. And that's saying something.
Wow I can tell this is gonna flop hard
Im so getting this game, ive been a michael Myers fan since ever
why is it giving fortnite
Boy oh boy that animation is bad
I’m so hype for this game! I’m a huge fan of the movie and i can’t wait too see if you play as Michael or as the victim he stalks
Oh my god fimally
F13 lobby was so much better than Texas 😂
Close enough. Welcome back, Friday the 13th the game!
Don’t make this game on some online only have two options, regular gameplay, and online please thank you
只要我能扮演迈克尔·迈尔斯，那才重要 As long as I can play as Michael Myers that what matters 😆
IM SO EXCITED PLEASE PLEASE BE GOOD
Gun Media has their hands on this, no thanks! They ruined Friday the 13th big time and fans shouldn't forget that. Friday the 13th was lame after 2 days of playing, nothing new to look forward to, they offered you ugly ass new outfits for a price, and there was never any upgrades or additional content made for it. It was a fast money grab for them so they lost public trust big time. Server issues, the game had tons of bugs, cars could fly off the map, and more. This game will be a copy cat of Friday The 13th, no real thought will be put into this at all. They are banking no the idea of nostalgia just like they did for the stupid Killer Clowns game that sucked and the Texas Chainsaw game that was terrible. You can only dupe your fans so many time before they stop trusting your product. Like I said, they are banking on idiots for nostalgia on this vs it actually being a great game.
gun studio involved. smh all these poor souls don't know what they did to TCM. won't be buying
So they're making a Michael Myers DBD clone even though Michael Myers is already in DBD?
If this is going to be like Friday the 13th, it’s going to suck.  Hate to say it, but someone needs to innovate the horror genre for games.
I really hope they nail the look and feel being as authentic as possible. That’s 90% of the experience
😂😂😂 lot of *Kombatants* heads was on that porch
LFG!!! 🎃🔪
Is Dr. Loomis' voice AI here or something wtf...
Could have picked a better voice for the narrator
That was waaaaaay cool.
Whatever purchases I make ingame I will do with the thought of inevitable betrayal in the back of my mind, thanks to GUN. I will get the game because I have nowhere else to go after TCM, but I will be salty all the way.
I cannot count how many times I have watched this. I am still in disbelief this is actually happening 🥹🥹🥹
Oh boy, another licensed variant on Dead By Daylight! Cannot wait for it to be a masterpiece on the level of Evil Dead, Texas Chainsaw, Killer Klowns and Friday the 13th.
Shivers 😮
John be making anything but a the thing movie
Ok but what will you do run away the entire time 😂
I got scared thinking about playing this
this is gonna flop
In order for the game to be successful you have to take it all the way back to the legitimate beginning of Halloween the original not the re made original Halloween.  Especially with fall coming and then Halloween in just over 2 months away 👌🏻
WWWWWWWWWW
YESSSS  I can't wait to go 'round as Michael Myers killing everyone!!!  It's what I've always wanted!!  Yaaaaaaaayyyy!!! 🔪 😱 🔪  Die babysitter! DIE!!!!!! 😊😊😊
Yet another hide and seek game is coming
Can’t wait 2026 gonna be good
fucking up Michael Meyers in a video game will be so cathartic for childhood me who was afraid of him walking on my room every night
i hope they dont move like that in the game lol but also its illfonic/gun soooo cant wait to see multiplayer where meta ruins the game because apparently nobody knows how to do balance in these games anymore..... personally i think we shouldnt buy it but people will so they will cary on killing games
I’m not gonna lie, this trailer was very amateurish, looks fanmade rather than actual professionals
I been waiting for this!! It's gonna be offline too yess!! 🎉❤ Let's celebrate!!
Fire bruh😮😮😮
This is amazing. Pre order will be done right away
Graphics and everything look exactly like the Friday 13th game.
Hope this game doesn’t run into a some legal bs like F13
❤thats the right mask too🎉🎉
Just let me go house to house as Michael while the music plays and I’m happy
0:30 0:32
Excited to give it a go!
Ouuuu gotta finish up Killer Klowns Platinum in time for this. Looks wicked
Rip Friday the 13th
Bruh ❤
People, be aware!!! GUN is known for their abandon ware. And illfonic isnt that much better. No more purchases from me!
Oh no. Another game by Gun. Skip.
Thank goodness it is not final game.  This looked like a students demo reel that says “Hey, you will see a lot of bugs but this isn’t final final… just give me another half a year or so to polish it up so I can apply for a job”.
They should have just did an original voice over instead of trying to replicate lumus. Cause that was trash
2026??? Wtf
Hopefully better than the Texas chainsaw one. Or any and every horror game remake. Is the prerequisite that it has to be a horrible, live, multi-player game when it comes to classic horror movie games?
STOP WITH MULTI PLAYER NON CAMPAIGN SHOULD BE AMAZING HORROR GAMES!! OH MY GOD! THEY FINALLY GOT THE HINT AND SEE WHY ALL THE OTHERS FAILED!! Hellraiser looks better.
The fact that it can be single player has me hooked already.
I hope this is legit game. I got disappointed with other games
Holy crap FINALLY!!!!
How about a Halloween Kills where you take on civilians, then firefighters, then police, then SWAT, then the National Guard, then the US military, etc. Cause we all know that Michael is supernatural.
I wish we still had the Friday The 13th game, this game won’t come close to ft13
Why didn’t they get Gourley to do Loomis’s voice for this?
It’s gonna be just like Friday the 13th game
Gameinformer interview with chief creative director says singleplayer will be Michael Myers ONLY and its mainly to prepare you for multiplayer which is a damn shame and big missed opportunity for a truly terrifying SP.
Where do I pre order ?
Wow this is gonna be good !!!!!
Yes
Man oh man I hope they have a story mode. ❤
Been waiting years for this. Just hope it doesn’t die like Friday the 13th and tcm…
I want the busta rhymes karate skin 😂
Where’s the knife?!?!
Friday the 13th was more fun than DBD  I’m just saying
If this game plays like the Friday the 13th game it will last a week or less
25 Halloween 🎃... CAN'T WAIT
Finally a successor to Friday the 13th
Looks wild
I bet it’s gonna be a asymmetrical multiplayer game with the option to do PVE.  So they can market it as “single player”
Realistic tho
I wished for a game.When I saw this video I was like:WHAT is this a game or movie...Yeah it's a game
I'm not impressed
Why do players walk like toddlers?
I cant believe it 80s baby nightmare come true!! I cant wait!!
1:13 Gave me chills. I love it!!!!
RIP GTA VI
I love how Micheal hasn’t even done anything in the trailer. His presence alone evokes the sheer weight of terror - I look forward to this game!
that trailer was horrible lol
"asymmetric horror game" i'm out of here
“no. no. ahhhh.”
Worst lector i ever heard
we’re getting Hellraiser AND Halloween games?? we getting FED 😩🖤🖤🖤
finally, a Halloween game.
Is it going to suck? Very likely. Will I play it? Definitely.
LETSSS GOOO BABY been waiting my whole life for a Halloween game
If thats meant to be Samuel Loomis talking......I'm already cynical.
Yo, is that guy from dbd? I know, i know...
Not sure whats up with the "i have bad knees" shamble hes doing at the end but yeah
Games like this are only good for a few months or so
Yes!!
A single playing horror game based on a movie? What a strange and unique idea 😆 I wish they would have done that with Texas chain saw
I hope its better than that texas chainsaw massacre game
This is gonna be cool
It’s a serious L… that they are not releasing this… for this up and coming Halloween season…. Smh
Another game of running from the killer or controlling the killer and kill people meh
Damn, PS2 graphics making a comeback? 👀
HYPE
Awe man I was hoping it was another installment in the movie franchise.
"A quiet town - just like hundreds of other small towns all across America. A town... just like yours. But it was here, on October 31st, 1963. No motive, no warning, no provocation. Just... senseless death. I met him fifteen years ago. I thought there was hope - that it could be reached! But what I met was not a child. No emotion, perhaps not even human. Fifteen years later, he returned home. But what happened that night was only the beginning! It wasn't just a killing-spree - it was a reckoning. You can't stop him. You can't reason with him. You can't kill... the Boogeyman."  See you on October 31st, Halloween
This will be sick hopefully on Xbox
you can't kill the Buggie man was so cool and I am a horror fan to and I love the Halloween moves and the Friday the 13th moves
If you cannot play as in single player Micheal then it is a complete missed opportunity.
I mean the friday 13th is understandable they had no choice
I hope this game starts playing theme song whenever Michael enters. If you can play as Michael, I hope everytime you go after someone the theme plays.
Another trash multiplayer horror game? That 1v4 model, or however they do it, has ruined so many potential stars. Evil dead, Friday the 13th, etc. just let us play solo!!!
this could be Halloweens friday the 13th game
DANGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
Let's hope that this game isn't dead after 6 weeks
I have q feeling this will be like friday the 13th. Also some news we all know the cenobite game is comjng out, now halloween game as well but it is comfirmed that a new friday game is in thr works too
The idea behind the game is awesome but it’s not looking promising AT ALL
Horrible and unrealistic animations and graphic designs will be the death of this game.
Singleplayer AND MULTIPLAYER? Better not mess up my favorite killer or ima be so pressed. Already have dbd where you cant kill anyone as a killer or survive as a survivor. Please dont make this a perk/team based game 😂
I love the halloween series its abt time someone make a game like friday the 13th for it
GUN is in on it and for those reasons im out
Announcement, not final product... relax, enjoy, give it a chance to be it's own thing! I'm excited. 🍻
bad graphics aside, the exposition kills the mood, would have been way creepier without the rambling
Hopefully, we get a chance to play as Michael aswell
I swear this better not be like Friday the 13 or the evil dead game, this better be an actual game
Ngl dumb as hell to announce this near Halloween knowing damn well it’s dropping next Halloween this game gon flop if gta out by then 😂
Ok. So are you playing as Michael?
looked great up until the characters showed up. Animation that clunky is inexcusable these days.
2026🥲 I was so hyped this was coming out this October
i got excited for this bc i love the halloween movies but after reading the comments, now i'm scared 😅 i hope it's good
Reskinned games of what is already out it seens
Thank God we are getting a halloween game and with John Carpenter
Its only right for them to release it on halloween please dont fumble the release date
Looked good until that chick ran out of the house. The quality dropped 50%. Then Michael looking like a bobble head.
When I say I'm excited. That's a understatement
would be so dope if this came out near halloween
10/10
B rated game based just off her running
Idk about Meyer's body proportions kinda looks like it could be a small woman.
Yeeesh. That voice over work isn’t great.
Please, don't turn it into DBD clone, like Friday The 13th or Texas Chainsaw... Those two games is a sad story about greedy IP😢
Wait so this is gonna be like Friday the 13 game but Myers edition bro I wonder if you can play as Myers if not it's gonna be like those mobile Myers game
First hellraiser and now halloween 😱
I saw Gun and then remembered the other horro asymetrical game they released which died, Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I'll try to not be hyped for this game and see how it is when there's more info on it x_x
Single player, I’m in!
Michael myers game before gta6
my dad introduced me to the franchise. i’ll do the same for my daughter
It’s about damn time 🤦🏾‍♀️😂😂🥲 I can’t wait for this 🎃🔪‼️
Holy shit dude. I got goosebumps watching this. Let’s FKN GO
NOP pieces os shit ass scamers dont trust you any more LOL
For all the devs at Gun Interactive all i ask is for longevity guys that’s it for the sake of one of the greatest movie franchises ever we are 2/2 on failed games do not drop the ball getting the rights for the licensing agreements and actual good dlc content
What is that animation
I'm guessing you play as Michael.
It would be great if they find a way to stop this game from "play for a week and then lose interest curse" that most of these games suffer from. Michael deserves more than that. I'm strictly talking about the multiplayer aspect here.
Please tell me Karen is in this game. I would go after her first and foremost every time I play Michael. "Gotcha my ***"
Knew this day would come!
Finally
FINALLYYY A HALLOWEEN GAME 😭😭🙏🏽, i used to pray for times like this
Crazy what a 12ga slug would do… I could of ended this back in the 80s
Michael Myers’s vs Jason voorhees
I just hope Micheal  Myers pov is third person like jason’s in f13th i hate it in first person on dbd
Can’t wait!
Thank God! 🤩🙏 And we better get to play as Michael Myers. Don't try that Friday the 13th crap cause I'm not going to buy it to run from him as some girl for the millionth time in movies already. No offense. This should be a classic game
FINALY...They came up with the idea of ​​making a play for this movie.
I adore you michael myers😍
Better not be a dbd copy like texas that shit was ass
Hell yeah
Damn got excited I thought this was a new movie lol
this is 100% a fake trailer used to just announce the game.... REMEMBER NO  PRE ORDERS
2026? Wtf
do anybody know if the game is the same as the movie ?
Lowkey looks fire
Hopefully it's like Alien Isolation
I never got into the Halloween movies cause slashers are too disturbing for me 😢
We got Friday the 13th in 2017, ten years later we get Halloween. Just amazing.
No matter what happens we’ll be supporting this masterpiece finally
Bro is it just me or the animation and models look terrible? It looks like a bunch of free assets with mixamo animations. I hope the actual game looks better than this. Also I think it would be cool if you played as Michael, but since it says multiplayer too idk about that  Also terrible impression and it’s made by gun… i don’t have much hope for this
DbD: Ha ha ha, no
Yay
This is gonna be the greatest game ever
Gun and Illfonic the Same Devs that made Friday the 13th the game, Halloween The Game Should be epic!
1963?
ALL YOU FAKE MICHAEL MYERS FANS STFU AND GO AWAY OR ITS YOUR AXX
Bro going around and killing people as Michael Myers in a story based setting is gonna be so dope
Sikander555
I really hope they do this right and don't rush it...this could be an amazing game.
2026 😩
Was excited till I saw gun was attached to this still salty about how they handled tcm
That score plus the narrator, gave me cold chills
Now this is my type shi. I’m STOKED AND READY
Will the game play match Friday the 13th?
Woah dope. Heading to play Texas Chainsaw Massacre now 😂
Hope illfonic doesn't let this one die as quick as the last two
Multiplayer game gross 🤮. That single player mode that they mentioned is going to be bullshit
Man, I will always just absolutely _love_ that Halloween theme song. It is perfection..
These games are trash
It’ll never get Old don’t disappoint
The gun at the end? Not buying it thanks lol. GL to whoever is going to spend money on this. Not me tho
1716m1716
Looks great, except the running girl which looked horrid. Also, Loomis just doesn't sound right.
Miguel Myers’s smh hopefully they buff him up in size lol
His waist looks snatched
Yeah next weekend I'll binge them all. Maybe not Rob Zombie's second one. Or Curse of myers
Awesome trailer
drop the voice over next time though
Tomara q ganhe do dbd
I think the his head very bigger.
w
Looks authentic. I just hope there's a detailed single player and actual substance.
Texas Chainsaw Massacre ~ Killer Klowns … GUN IILFONIC ???? just keep making fire ass games get our money and abandon them ???
I hope the atmosphere is good. So far it looks decent.
Do ppl actually enjoy dbd it looks like it’s for casuals lmao
Bro look like Dabo
Singleplayer yes!!
Be careful, guys. Gun co-published this.
When a major success like Friday gets shutdown they make a new one but Friday the 13th will only be the goat game forever
Hope this not a Friday the 13yh reskin
I’m curious to see how long this lasts before it gets taken down hopefully it won’t but it’s happened so much you should expect it at this point
A solo mode that’s good could make these games not die within months. I loved Friday the thirteenth the game. I enjoyed killer clowns and Texas chainsaw but they all have one thing in common, those games got no love later on and died quick. Hope this one turns out different, much love for this franchise 🤞
Gives me Friday the 13th vibes
“You can’t kill damnation Mister!”
Omg ❤
i remember back in 2011 when i was 10, me and my friends used to search for hw game for pc and we found some weird ones probably mods for some games and thought they were real.
The good news is there will be an official Halloween game!!🎉  The bad news is it was developed by GUN🫩  But at least there is a single player
Are these the guys that made the Friday the 13th game?  If so I hope they do better on this game
How is this a passable trailer 🤣
Immortality made flesh, not just a madman, time and essence had drowned in its mystique. Each step took for sake of fear and despair, colder than a blade. If death could walk, it’d be The Shape of the blackest eyes, under an expressionless mask.
Please be good!
Daz Games, H20 Delirious, I’ll be waiting for your walkthroughs.
so many good times on FT13th hope this is the same!!!
So ready, glad to have a new Halloween game since Dead By Daylight is too lazy to make a new game with different game modes
So... We probably should buy the Halloween DLC for DbD? They are probably removing it from stores soon.
Ok, I don’t like the fact it’s made by Gun & Illfonic because the way they treated Friday The 13th: The Game & Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Game by only updating the born of the games and then after a year they throw it out of the bag due to lawsuits and being lazy. So I’m a huge Micheal Myers Fan so I praying to god they don’t treat this game like they did to the last 2 because i swear to god if they do. Gun is canceled.
Not the best Loomis voice and they better do the game justice
I want the theme tune as my ringtone.
I have a question why Boogeyman's body looks small than his head , I mean his body looks weak overall the game theme is excited that I feel in movie
I hope they never stop making “Halloween” movies and games lol.
Is this from the same creators that abandoned their other projects ?
PLEASE Give us the Rob Zombie expansion pack
i’m hyped for this. john carpenter producing and a single player plus  multiplayer could mean it’ll last longer than the other horror asymmetrical games
ohhhhh yea
This looks good
Just Xbox or?
I want to play as Michael😂
This game looks like a funny trashy game
Lets hope they dong take this one away like friday the 13th
Another future gun deception
finally, a game that can replace Friday the 13th hope it turns good
I don't like how big Mr. Halloween's head is. He looks like a bobble head doll.
Can anyone please tell me what songs kendrick sounds like drakeo on? Kendrick uses some slang drakeo made up but other than that i dont hear it.
Michaels arms are swinging way too much. He doesnt move his arms while stalking the victim. Loomis voice is pretty bad but the music sounds perfect.
Oh man I hope this doesn’t get left for dead after a month
Yeah this looks terrible
Michael Myers: “On folknem I be walking,    I ain’t never ran a day in my life “ 🔪🚶🩸
The music and trailer is just perfect, now i want some gameplay
Given the people who are making it, I give it less than a year befors it either dies by itself due to shitty management or the devs abandon it.  A shame, because DBD could really use some competition to give BHVR a reason to step it up.
Just don't neglect this too.
Remember guys, this is Illfonic and Gun Media, they take ips for a quick cash grab and leave them to die. For example, Killer Klowns and Predator Hunting grounds and most recently Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
1:00 Michal staring through the window as the 'hero' is running down Haddonfield. They nailed the 1978 vibe in this trailer. Just ignore the Dr Loomis voice over.
2026? Yall should have drop this game this year Oktober
Getting ready to see CaseOh Dookie some Drawers
Don’t drop this it look bad u gotta do sum way better then Friday 13th bc that game was low-key bad to yall make me not like horror games dead by daylight still got yall beat just do better for Halloween
Excited for sure, the next Friday the 13th videogame!
I love the concept, but the character models need serious work (No Mocap?).
Lets go
I urge All of you not to buy anymore of guns games as they continuously lets down their community and abandons their games
Nice!
Gun. loves the goofy running animations
Holy voice acting
Mobile game ad on YT looking game.
Check out Hellraiser Revival's trailer. That one looks so cinematic 🔥
Are we going to get different masks of Michael like Halloween 4 or 5 or just the one we see?
Why michael got a fat ass head tho? 🤣🤣
As a big fan of horror movie games, I cannot support this game due to the ties it has with Gun studios and highly suggest everyone do the same. They stopped supporting Friday 13th (I know legal issues were involved so they can be forgiven for this one) and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. They are now known for just giving up on their games and I know for a fact the same thing will happen with this one.
I cannot wait !!! 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🎃
If I play this on story mode it be 10 times as scarier than playing with other players
Best horror theme song of all time! LETS GO!

I mean I love the original Halloween, but how will single player levels work? I can't imagine every level will just be like try and escape a little Cape Cod style house while Michael hunts you down.
We got Jason back before GTA 6 release ...
Wey, el soundtrack. 😍😍
This is just goated🔥
Welcome back 🎃
This better be good.
Looks kinda cheap.
I bet it's a Tombstone Myers 💔🥀
Can’t wait
the boogeyman
GUN??? Seriously? After what happened with TCM and Friday the 13th, this really freaked me out.Please, at least don’t ruin this game.
The Loomis AI voice over is absolutely horrible.🎃
Same people that did Friday 13th and TCM, I am sure it will be a balanced game with longevity.
its just gonna  die just like klowns and leatherface's game :L
Gun is about to kill another horror icon.
I look forward to this game, but I eventually can't wait for the return of our big ol' pal from Camp Crystal Lake to make his return to video games too as he is currently with returning to films
I hope they don't make Michael look like such a nerd in the finished game play
This and hellraiser?? About time they start making games about the classic horrors, please keep this single
I will pray to all Gods there will be no legal disputes, game from same develops of Friday 13-th
Will be awesome if this game is like Happyhills Massacre, you play the killer, the victims and the investigator in each chapter, in that case, filling Michael with bullets using Dr. Lumis would be my favorite part
Where's the gasoline ? Where s the fireworks ? Stupid bastardo
What’s going on so MANY good games are coming next year! My pockets are gonna hurt!
Nice!
So gun goes with a company that made two games that died within less than two weeks of each other as opposed to the previous company that made two games that lasted pretty well. This ain’t gonna last for more than a month. I don’t even give it a month.
Is this by the same people who made Friday the 13th?
Hide and Seek with Micheal Myers? Yeah...I´m dead already. 😆
The Donald Pleasence voice sounds like it's from an AI generator, but regardless, excited for this one and curious to see how gameplay is.
We need a nightmare on elm street game
This better not be friday the 13th game all over again
I was about to get so confused seeing this title  like "how tf was Myers gonna come back after being turned to mush in Halloween Ends, unless that was a victim wearing his mask 😭😭"
The voice acting is awful
Great another game that can launch a mess and get abandoned so you can’t play it
Why Michael Myers Does it look like a woman?
OMG!!!  SO HYPED!!! (The Theme!!!)
Lowkey looks like a 2015 game tho
Awesome very original wish they would make a decent Single player Jason game tho
Am i weird for thinking a story mode as Michael would be dope or
🎃 🎃 THIS ONE GONNA SMASH THE FRIDAY 13th release. Imagine if they did it with “before dawn” type of graphic design although I’m more than satisfied with the direction they’re allready going , and throw in multiple killing variations with Mike. What I mean by more killing variations are simply adding more than one way to kill in any area you choose too like if your in the kitchen , you should be able to have a field day with how you want to execute the kill. Examples being multiple ways of stabbing with knives and other objects aswell , or choosing to bash your victim to death with mikes unreal strength via punches , slams , choking , toss around with rag doll effects or even combing all of those is different ways and have that same method and way of killing in almost any section of the map. Then it won’t feel so repetitive even when playing the victim
"single player experience" in more than half of the comments, when its almost just the same 2 companies actually finding out what the issue with F13 the game was
Ich denke Mikel ist tod ? Wie oft steht der den noch auf langsam wirds langweilig 😅
looks terrible unfortunately
We need a new Halloween movie.
The fact that Dead by Daylight's Halloween trailer from 8 years ago still blows this out the water...
Myers looks like a skinny dork and the character movements look jittery and cartoonish.
The voice acting could definetly have some improvement, almost sounds A.I.
Are they planning to do all horror slasher franchises? They going crazy with this one
I see the hair not flowing in the air and remaining stiff as she runs tells me everything I need to know 😂 another Friday the 13th and Texas chainsaw like game 😵‍💫 people excited there’s a story mode but I bet each mission is just going to feel like an offline match where you have to complete the objectives alone 😅
why even show this lol
So basically this game is gonna be like Friday The 13th?
I am going to loop Myers at shack if this Haddonfield has one!
is the shape from DBD? 😱
omg why am i just now finding out about this im so excited
That horrible Loomis impression has GOT TO GO
Um, his suit is actually more green than blue in the original movie. Also, why does he walk like a 70 year old Nick Castle? And... the jack o' lantern isn't 100% accurate.
Character models and the graphics in general look like garbage.
Awesome John carpenter is producer, this game is going to be awesome
Michael Myers: my turn >:)
I just had a eargasam
Ohh my god, I dunno how to feel about this. It BETTER not be like the evil dead because that was complete TRASH.
Can’t wait. Basically Friday the thirteenth but done right?? Missing those days tho 😭😭
Wish rockstar was making this game like they did man hunt on ps2
please tell me gun isnt making this game. they butchered firday and texas chainsaw massacre, if gun is making this, then i am not buying this
god michael myers and Halloween franchise is actually one of the worst most boring slashers ever made. how is it even popular
Another Texas chainsaw saw massacre type game woo hoo bring back the Jason game then next do Freddy Kruger then scream game then do chucky game 👍🏼
Friday the 13th the game part 2
Please tell me this will be a retro, side-scrolling beat-em-up
Its about freaking time!
Man the gaming industry turned into a joke  it’s like a bunch of simulators are just being made what happened to a story you can play for a while and not have to go online i miss the old days that’s why I haven’t bought no ps5 or the new xbox it isn’t the same anymore I’ll leave it for the kids and if you wanna buy gta for 80 plus you’re trippin 😂
Oof GUN being involved, not a fucking chance, fool me once and all that.
I’m staring to see a pattern. Friday The 13th, Killer Klowns From Outer Space.
Should’ve just used AI for the voice instead of making someone voice the narrator. The one time AI could’ve done it better.
Is this going to be like Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw Massacre?
Gun will abandon this game fast
Highly doubt this game will flop due to John carpenter being apart of this
if its anything like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre game im gonna get it
Why can't we get good horror games anymore?
Oh…… I can’t wait… 😮😮😮❤❤❤❤
I’m excited now not just for the single player part but the same studio that did Friday the 13th R.I.P. I am hoping it’s not glitchy and buggy like Friday the 13th but I can see great funny random moments in the game happening with other streamers
Wow that is some of the WORST voice over work I've ever heard. Very amateur.
Next horror game to flop, we've already seen Texas, Friday, killer clowns, evil dead... I don't want to buy it and after a few months the servers close, that's sad
Single player horror from this vein should be much bigger
please just let this be a good game halloween is one of my favourite movies 🙏
My god single player can be so good if they do it the right way! A survival horror Halloween game would be so much fun w Michael Meyers chasing you around!
The leaves should have moved when she ran by them.
So why is a sick, slightly Scottish Obi-Wan narrating?
Ahhh gun studios. No thanx. No thanx.
Let's gooo ❤ an epic story to play
I just want to be able to walk around as Mike and kill people. That’s all I ask.
First Hellraiser, now Halloween. The renaissance of horror movie video games is here. Also, I'm glad they learned from Evil Dead's failure and decided to make these games single player instead of DBD clones.
Exactly how much of a single player game are we talking?
Remember the reboot era for slasher movies? I feel like we’re in the game era for slasher movies now
OH MY GAWD YESSSSSSSHHH!!! Can this be for the switch!???? I want to play as Jamie Lloyd and Laurie and Michael Myers!!!!!😊❤🎃👻💀
As a child Freddy Kruger was the top dawg but as an adult and 80s baby no one is more iconic than Michael Myers. His theme music alone is untouchable
So another non game where the players make the game
Yeah i'm good on dead by daylight clones thanks already got killer clowns and texas and i'm ashamed to admit that
Im here to see the heavies
Insane trailer, but after what they did with leatherface, im a bit worried.
0:55 Look at that run animation. Disgusting. It's sad that the PS5 released and we had next gen graphics and game play with Demon Souls. But EVERY game after that has been PS4 level graphics. Why even release the PS6 if games still look this bad?  I'd argue that P.T back during the early PS4 days looked better than this.
Hopefully they don't abandon ship.on this one too.
He is back 🎉🎉🎉
lets see how gun messes this one up
This is what they should’ve done with Texas chainsaw massacre game, single player and story mode.
If only ppl knew in here that this game is handled by Gun Interactive & IllFonic. At least IllFonic has good intentions but they're yet to make anything successful and Gun Interactive will abandon this quickly just like everything else and have the most pathetic whiny devs.
I'm already tired of Michael Myers 🥱🥱, when will we see Jason again, we haven't heard from him since 2009 😢😢
Idc about the single player I want to run from Mike with my buds 🔥🔥 also hopefully they have other outfits from the movies for Michael even a rob zombie one would be cool too see even though I didn’t like those as much
THIS BLACK OPS 7 TRAILER IS 🔥🔥🔥
Mikey Myers single player lessgooooo
Need gameplay videos
WATCH ME DO IT THOUGH!
This shit will flop just like Friday 13. Shame it’s a great series
I hope corey will be in the game❤❤
Yes please 🎃
hopefully this game bangs like jason game, hopefully they can use different locations from the movies
Oh My God!!!😱😱😱
Please, just make it GOOD…
gun games is attached to this?  that'll be a no.  how many more horror IP's are they gonna kill?
This game looks sick
This animation and graphics look like south of midnight
I cannot wait for this to drop I ain’t been this hype since the announcement of F13 at the beginning I hope this one last longer
watch them abandon the game
gonna be epic
Michael Myers looks skinny and puny, in the movie he is a big dude.
And will be delisted after 3 or 5 years
A Bugiman
Y'all ever thought it was because that senseless screaming that Mike was always able to find his victims no matter where they were
Bring back 1vs7, 1vs4 is boring 😴
Please let there be an option for 3rd person
Another Friday the 13 😂💀
Off the music ALONE this game is a must get. It feels SOOO true to the movie This Halloween score is SO iconic
I wonder if you get the play as him or if you’re playing against him. These will be some of the sickest kills ever.
I can’t wait
Another game they’re gonna yank the servers from?
I thought this was a joke video after I heard the voice. That sounds so cringe LMAO. The rest was good.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
there betterrrrrr be a story mode i stg .
For what game system? Is it gone be on PlayStation?
I guess he’ll never die…
this kinda sucks
This shit is so FIREEEEEEEEEE🔥🔥 wtf I've been waiting for this lfgo. Hopefully this game as good as the Friday the 13th Game (RIP😢) I hope that game returns somehow hopefully🙌
Whhaaaaaaaaaaaa????😮
I pitched this idea to my little brother a few months ago a Halloween game with a single player to see it actually happening is so dope I’m truly excited for this game
That music will never get old it can be 100 years from now and that music will still be on point..😅
I hope we really can run for our lives and it’s just on going until we beat him instead of how that Jason game was I wanna do more than just make it through the night I wanna find a way to defeat him
Girl: Oh my god a guy in a mask, he just killed her! Guy: Whoa calm down! Girl: I don't why he's doing this to- come on come on we got to go! Guy: Oh, NO AUGH.  In case you wanted to know what they're saying.
I would play 70 for that game of it plays like the movie. 🎉🎉
finally
Omfg yay for single player! I've fallen off with most horror games nowadays because everything is online co op. Can't wait for this to come out! Side note- love that they have Michael's breathing amplified towards the end. His breathing always made me uneasy in certain scenes from past movies lol. Awesome touch!
man, hellraiser now this??? what is goin gon
Oh gosh, it would be so bad...
SINGLE PLAYER!!! thank you thank you bless you bless you!
I give this server 6 months
Watch Gun leave this in the dust before it even comes out. As much as i want to be excited because I love Myers, I just can't because of TCM, very dissapointed its them working on it.
Now we need my favorite CHUCKEEEEEEEEEEE
why is Michael’s head so big and disproportionate to his body? 😂 surprised I haven’t seen anyone mention this. He doesn’t look too much like Halloween 1978
My favorite horror villain
YOOOO THIS IS 🔥
Please be good, please be good,  please be good,  please be good, please be good!
I’m just gonna insta lock busta rhymes
O man all these horror games in the works, yesssss!!
First hELLRISER GAME now this please do the jason Voorshee One
We need vampire 1998 game too by John carpenter it's very terrified
What happened to F13 was not GUN's/Illfonic's fault, yet people seem to lump it in with them (GUN) abandoning TCM. They literally couldn't do anything with the F13 lawsuit, they couldn't even add a new tree or a rock to a map, a developer literally said this. Its understandable why they eventually gave up, they were just waiting around doing nothing while two guys argued over money and a settlement.  As for TCM I never bought it (so far), but them abandoning support for it so soon, I agree it is bad. However, Illfonic had nothing to do with TCM so I see more hope for this. Carpenter is also credited as an executive producer which is a major bonus.  Also, for those complaining that the singleplayer experience will either just be offline bots, something like the F13 challenges, or the virtual cabin, literally do your research morons. The Halloween Game website literally says it in black and white:  "IllFonic dives into why making a singleplayer narrative in Halloween was a must. The narrative for singleplayer in Halloween takes on a new shape. Playing as Michael Myers, walk through memorable locations from the 1978 classic such as the Myers House or bask in the recreated atmosphere of Haddonfield".  Lets just see how it plays out and actually give it a chance before prematurely calling it a failure. I'm a huge Halloween fan, I see Halloween and I'm there for it Day 1. If its anywhere near as fun as F13 was (which was waaaaay more fun than Dead By Daylight regardless of the bugs/glitches) this will be awesome.  If it happens a 2nd time (like with TCM) then yeah there's a pattern forming. Call me a sucker or whatever, but its Halloween, as a fan of the series I can't not be there for this. Especially since it has a singleplayer mode.
they better give michael wider shoulders than THAT because he does not have extremely narrow shoulders
Really hope the in town feels alive that we will go into town as well not just terrorizing in individual houses, the map possibilities are plentiful the NPC use will be really cool. Can"t wait!
This kind of sounds like Dr Loomis
Can we have a game where we get to see what Michael Myers gets upto for the other 364 days of the year?   Fixing up the roof on his shack, befriending a lost dog, long hot summer nights sat out on the decking together....the dog doing all the talking because Michael's not the talkative type. Giving the mask a break and watching YouTube tutorials on face painting??
Wauw
Ahhh, so GUN ditched yet another one of their games to start up the next short term cash grab
Yeah after Gun gave up on a great TCM game, I will not be supporting this game, I’ll maybe play it when it comes out for free on PlayStation pass…   I never forgot 🤷🏼‍♂️
Now... and I'm guessing here. If it's the same as Friday the 13th... Got Damn! We back in business here!
Probably gonna be like the Friday the 13th game
Goat of slashers 🔥
Oh boy, there goes another one. Now we wait for a Chucky flop
Ps5, xbox or pc?
GET GUNN OFF THE PRODUCTIONS
Yes finally a new horror game loved the original Friday game this looks sick
Jason game was pretty good. Need also an update and fresh reboot. Hope this isnsimilar or better ❤🎉
Now make another movie
I’ve always wanted a Halloween game. Please be good.
Da real Michael fans please like this !! We been waitin on sum like this for years 🔥🔥🔥😂
TFW you playing F13 and find keys in first 30 seconds
Oh boy.
2026? But I want it now! (Homer Simpson voice)
I‘d prefer a new not crap movie
When I think about it, Michael wouldn’t have survived a neighborhood in Texas 😂😂😂. Especially not on full of black folks and Latinos 😂😂. He would’ve gotten popped over and over until he was nothing but pieces
Thanks goodness they made her hot. If we're going to bring back 1980s scary movies, all the chicks need to be hot. No one wants to kill fuglies.
Looks inside Same devs as TCM. I’ll stick with DBD thank you very much.
naht his is crazy\
This gave me the exact feeling I felt back in 2016 when Michael Myers was announced for Dead by Daylight.
why she running like she has to take a big sh1t real bad??
This will fail just like TCM the game.
Holy shit this is gunna be great
The game hasn't even gone into full production it's gonna take more than a year
The music score is definitely what made the movie
Bro who the hell sent GMod video to IGN and said “Its a new Halloween game” 😭
would be 100 percent a game like friday the 13th. so its no worth it..
Played this game with fam till the wheels fell off, hopefully this one doesn’t get shut down
Dr. Loomis: "You can't kill the Boogieman."  Well, actually, you can kill him by decapitation...if you can get close enough without getting killed yourself.
This is like watching Toy Story 1 humans Animations😂
The music❤
Mixed to bad reviews on their games. This will be another trash game.
Narrator sounds cheap
lol, made by illfonic and gun, both had great games and abandonned them.  yeah, hard pass
Man this looks awful
Hope that it will not be another left for dead game after a year like gun did for tcm
That theme music is so classic and still eerie as if it just came out yesterday, It literally gives me the chills till this day.
Gun. 🤢🤮
When is the game coming out?😮
Sadly it’ll get abandoned just like Friday the 13th, TCM, and killer clowns.  Never buy a game from gun
Wow that’s dope .. wait do yu get to be Michael tho lol ?
Why’s it always old characters, can’t they make new original ones?
Sucks illphonic didn’t think to give their predator game a single player mode… but still, this looks cool.
What's with the Indian announcer. YOU CAN NOT REASON WITH THE CURRY 😂😂
Did y’all not see the “and multiplayer”
level cap is coming
BORING
What’s with the PS2 level animation? Really took me out of it.
Single PLAYER!!!! 🙌🙌🙌🙌
hope is not going to be a failure as texas chainsaw massacre
“you can’t kill the boogeyman”🔥 i got chills when he said that.  i can’t wait for this game!
I hope this is going to be online like Friday the 13th the game. And I hope it stays
It's about time! :D also singleplayer ftw!
Nice
Please tell me he will look way better than this in the game lol
МЯСО БРАТЬЯ
Looks close enough. Welcome back Friday 13 the Game
Dreadful animation. Looks like Sims
YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
omg
Jason dbd with Michael myers
Real question chat how real can this beeeeee
The mfs that made Killer Klowns think they can make a Halloween game when their initial project fuckin failed smh bro and they keep throwing away money for stupid rough drafts that fail horribly
YEEEESSSS THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR
NO PLEASE NOT GUN ANYONE BUT GUN 😭🙏💔
Aw hell yeah let's go time to be my no 3 goat of horror Micheal myers
Yay it’s single player which means it will be a lot scarier
The narration was dire imo. Other than that, I like the look of it, the character models have a Time Splitter vibe to them
Could it be? The predecessor to the Friday the 13th video game????
Seeing the gun logo made me lose all hope, ts is doomed
I immediately thought of Friday the 13th and assumed immediate dogshit. I hope this will be good
Yeah nah, can't just keep abandoning games to pump out another cash cow. God gun sucks and F13 and tcm are two of my favorite games. Too bad they're made by a greedy company that drives them into the ground
Please don't be like   Killer klowns  Friday the 13th  Texas chainsaw  Dead by daylight  Evil dead
this one feels triple A
This clearly needs more work, but please don't let it go into Halloween, Halloween Kills and Halloween Ends territory.
Gun? well just expect it to be abandoned after they squeezed out all their microtransactions in a year
Oh my God, I’m so happy right now
THIS LOOKS AWFUL
The fact it says single player brought a tear to eye , thank God. You ruined Texas chainsaw for me please dont ruin this.
Late nights on Friday the 13th 10 deep w my friends are some of my favorite gaming memories ever. Please be just as good 😭🙏🏽
Great, another game for Gun. to stop updating in a year. 😅
Gun. is developing it. Game's already a lost cause.
Not sure what to expect from this, but for a long time I'd thought a Halloween game in a similar vein to Hitman would be pretty cool. You'd play as Michael of course.  Perhaps a stealth system that incorporates shadows like Thief or Riddick.
Oh baby
I can't tell you how many times I've watched this in one day.
Please don't dud me. Samhain is upon Us.
After Gun dropped the ball with Texas Chainsaw Massacre game I'll never buy another game from them again.
What would I search up to get the music of Micheal chasing Laurie?
Got Halloween before Battlefront III
I'm so sick of asymmetrical horror games.
Lady’s and gentleman, Nick fucking Castle. 🤟
They gon have to blow that mf up
This game is going to be powered by Unreal Engine 5 so that's exciting... it should be a beautiful game in terms of graphics. I just hope Gun doesn't abandon it after 2 years .... they will make considerably more money if they stay in it for the longhaul...
tf is asymmetric stealth
😱😱😱😱
Is so scary and I do not like scary 😳😳  I do like watches scary stuff but not all the time though 😭😭 🙏 in Michael Myers is he loves to kill people
This looks cartoony as hell
That’s as creepy as ever!  No thank you.
I really liked it! I'm excited! I'm a huge Michael Myers fan
I love the vibes of the og halloween I watch it every year and part 4 ❤
amazing gameplay
Halloween: *exists*  Michael Myers: *determined breathing noises.*
Take my money 💰
Gun !! Nope I'm out Remember guys The main villain is the victim like TCM Because they don't know how to make fair games.
this is exciting but seeing Gun. involved with this game ruins the excitement TCM had soo much potential and they let it die hopefully its different time will tell
GUN is garbage
My son loved Friday the 13th game because of Jason, his favorite. Michael has always been my favorite and I'm so stoked for this game!!! Bet it comes out before GTA 6!!!
Man thank god for single player Mode like literally going to be so amazing and imma Michael Myers fan but this is a dream come true for me thank you gaming world Wow this is definitely amazing Literally can’t wait it look wayyy better then Friday the 13th and I love Jason to
Asym being made by Illfonic and Gun, I give it 2 months till they abandon it
This trailer makes more hype than Black bots 7
Man, that voice acting sucks XD
omg its DBD
This better be good!  Friday of the 13th straight up lags, while the Texas chainsaw massacre was good but could've been better.. in my opinion ❤
Only problem I have is we’re not getting story modes for these horror games. If we got story modes along with online single and multiplayer these games would probably survive.
WOW
Aw man... I wish it was announced this was coming out in October, this year!!! 😢
💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤
Where's Caliber at?
Wait for next year for a game where u run from him made by the same trash that did Texas chainsaw? Naw im good wtf is wrong with games
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES OMG YES!!!!!!!!!!
Michael vs Jason game shit what about a Freddy game 🤔🤔
It's gonna be multiplayer it's made by illfonic
I'm sorry, but that's such a bad Loomis impression.
I was speaking t my friend tell him they should make a holloween game since they did a Friday 13th
Que hype lpmt
Trailer generado por IA....
Trailer generado por IA....
They just confirmed it’s Nick Castle👏🏾🫶🏾
I like Gun because they tailor the entire game’s mechanics to the horror villain character.  As opposed to Dead by Daylight that has generic mechanics that the horror villain character behavior needs to be adjusted to.
Let’s hope that this game doesn’t get a lawsuit like Friday the 13th did….. and I’m really lucky that I’m a Halloween baby. 👍
Anything but re realise friday the 13th
I'm assuming it'll come out Halloween of 2026?
Do not buy the Halloween game.  We as a community need to stand firm against GUN media and boycott Halloween. If Halloween flops they’ll be forced to go back to work on the Texas Chainsaw Massacre game since GUN media will follow wherever the money is at. TCM has at least 2-3 more seasons worth of content and we as a community know this.   If Halloween does poorly, they’ll be forced to either sell the TCM game to a developer who will give it the proper care or they’ll continue working on TCM giving us a better, more content filled game with eventually the proper ending to it.
This game is going to be good can’t wait for it the best slasher  Michael Myers
Another game that will die within first few weeks
Please don’t screw this up gun
DROP THIS SHIT RIGHT NOWWW
Gun?  Nope.
Dang thus real this is going  to be amazing 😁😁🥹
Finally!
They already ruined it with this narrators voice
The DLC features your mom.
Finally single player experience.
Gun is like the reincarnation of LJN bad
Bro omfg Please stop with these fucking things. Come up with a new idea already jesus christ.
10FPS?
que foda
Hopefully theres a single payer campaighn
As a huge fan of the Halloween franchise, there is nothing about this that inspires any excitement for me. The only element that will keep my attention and hopes for the game is that John Carpenter is an executive producer.
btw this isn't gun project its illfonic's gun is just a co-support for marketing
Oh boy oh boy. Another online horror game for Dead by Daylight to kill
Hearing the theme song was anazing. Love this trailer. I want this game now.
oh my god?
the fact gun has a part in this game after Texas chainsaw massacre I can’t even be happy they make such great and beautiful games just to ruin them in the end
Meu assassino de filme de terror favorito vai ganhar um jogo finalmente 🤩
Same game as dead by daylight, Friday the 13th and Texas chainsaw massacre💀
Holy Shit!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍
When does it drop ?
Yessssssirrrrrr
Trailer looks low budget 😅
😂😂😂 My middle-aged self over here more excited over this game than my kiddos on Christmas. Thank you Gun for this. Nightmare on Elm street next!!!!!
I can't freaking wait!!!!!!!!
Single player AS Michael Meyers or the victim??? Being Meyers going around killing would be insanely cool!!! I think...
Looks cool but what are you actually gonna be able to do? Run from Michael? Be Michael? Just reenact the story of the 1978 film? After that’s done, what then?
I cannot wait!!!
If the Atari 2600 game is included as an easter egg, I might be tempted.
THANK U SO MUCH FOR SINGLE PLAYER, WISH FRIDAY DID THIS
I'ma let y'all in on a secret, if you have to have other people playing with you the game probably isn't fun, you are just compensating. If you can play by yourself and be enthralled, that is a good game.
COOL!!!!!!
Does anyone know what the single player game play is gonna be like?
This narrator sux
I've waited 30 years for this
That has to be the worst Loomis voice ive ever heard
Halloween for me
We got a Michael Myers game before GTA 6
Looks ok but they need to change the narrator, sounds like a high school presentation and very unprofessional. Honestly it ruined my day.
FINALLY YESSS
YES!!!! 🙌🏼 ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💯
wow
DBD
I will replay every Hellraiser film and then playthrough the upcoming video game before I play this (chances are I will be stupid and attempt to stream *EVERY SINGLE HALLOWEEN FILM EVER RELEASED* before playing this game lmao it's 13 films in total and I celebrate 13 nights of Halloween every year and the Rob Zombie remake premiered on the 19th of Oct do the math so uh yea it's possible lmao ); anyway im excited 😅
GUN involved, its a NOPE from me!
Just read the description over at the PlayStation store and it states that we will play as Michael! This should be good
Hopefully we play as mike.
Omg omg omg
Watch the Texas Chainsaw Game Downfall video by Alucard. Gun studio is gonna probably do the same exact thing they did to Texas Chainsaw. Shame.
why does Michael look like a little kid with his mask on 😂😂
Michael Myers was cool to play as in Terrordrome: Rise of the Boogey Men.
Let's go! Get f*cked dead by daylight
Can wate to see it in theaters
No mp no money
Here we go again....
My best friend would’ve loved this news. He was a Myers fan since he was a kid. Passed away may 16, 3 days before his birthday this year.
My fav horror IP, but I’ve been seen too much to have hope they didn’t destroy it with agenda and ideology. I hope I’m wrong but the good will has been spent long ago.
Friday the 13th fans we are so back 🤍🤍
👀
i hope breastie lee curtis is in this
What happened to tcm
Hopefully they fix the tuning animation. Shit looks crazy stiff.
Yesss
This game is gonna be good it's not dead by day ligh thank god
Yeah this game not coming out after seeing Gun logo 😂😂 but good intro doe and promo for something that's not coming out ..
Can we play as Michael Myers? Or just run from him all game?
cmon..that's no loomis talking😒
If this game didnt have a singleplayer mode it would launch at night and be dead by daylight
Ok this trailer did absolutely nothing but show the beginning of the movie basically..what kind of single player? You Micheal or the doctor or someone eles?
If it's like Friday the 13th style of game, this will be awesome. Selecting which Michael you are and the chance of ending up as a survivor to escape!
They need to make a Freddy Kruger asap !!
That animation looks wank
I knew it would come one day Jason,Leatherface,ash had theirs now it’s Michael’s turn   I hope we can get rob zombie Michael
If Joe Grizzly ain’t in here I don’t want it
Another quick cash grab from Gun Interactive
Rip Friday the 13 game 😢
Lemme preorder
Hopefully this game will not have any licensing issues just like Friday the 13th game. I’m really looking forward to this.
We got a Halloween game before we got gta 6
If Gunn media has anything to do with this I'm not buying it.
THE SHAPE
Gun and ilfonic ? Jajajajaja no, thanks bro
Man im hyped for this game but i hope it doesn't turn into another Texas Chainsaw Massacre , Killer clowns or Friday the 13th where the updates just stop :/
Yesssssssssssssss 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
HellRaiser and now Halloween. Whats next The Thing? If so, sign me up!
Omg I have to get this dude , can't wait to see the gameplay on hoodstas
Tombstone 4 Myers leggo
If it's also a single-player experience, then the killer will likely be controlled by an AI. Which isn't a bad thing if done right. Just look at Outlast Trials.
He was the man you sent to kill! The boogeyman
Hands down best horror movie ever made. Right along with scream the first 1
8i888888
I88⁸f88d fed EDF f8ddffi888f8⁸8⁸ifeef888ifffid8ff8⁸⁸⁸888fii8ii888888i88f88ii888
I pray they do this right. This could be an incredible gaming experience, if so.
peak
Sooo yall get the full rights this time? Or are we going to RELIVE Friday the 13th?  Wait it’s just in this is only “single player” Gun your a joke
Thank u❤ Love Michael
bro, every time I see gun involved in those projects, I die inside.
This is gonna be so good!
Yall ready for another cash grab that will only last a year or less 🥰🥰😍😍🫶🏾🫶🏾
Please don’t let what happened to Friday the 13th happen again😭
Admittedly, it looks a little bit jank,  but "Single Player" eh??  INTERESTING!  I'm glad that devs are getting a clue again and clearly, are interested in making some cash!
So glad it has a single player mode. Hopefully it means it's not just another asymmetrical pvp game. I'm hoping for a good experience with this one. It's always been one of my favorites 😁
Everything except this terrible Loomis impression is great.
Why not just combined an updated Jason game and the Halloween game together and make everyone happy?
I was just playing Friday the 13th 1989
Plzzzzzz dont fukkkkkk it up
Gun is trash
Ok......
I would love it to be either way you can try and survive and escape Michael or be michael
Single-player and multi-player, thank goodness ❤
This game been in the making for years. It looks like they finally completed it.. now that's Krazy work
I hope this is good, Michael is such a good character. I'd love to see a Chucky's game too.
I loooooove the ps2 graphics!
Who is that girl in the red jacket?
Here for the Nostalgia  🎃
Big Halloween fan. Deeply concerned with the animation team's abilities. Did you see her run and his deeply inaccurate stride? He doesn't rock to and fro. Pace steady, shoulders square, height level. Back straight. At least watch Halloween and try to give the bibe.This just felt like some kid made it on night for fun on his laptop using paint or something. It looks and sounds like a low-budget comedy came. No fear anywhere in this just pour voiceover and terrible animation. 2/10 trailer. Way to set expectations because you literally cannot hope to do worse on the game. I bet you nobody that made this trailer has ever seen a Halloween movie.
Gaming in 2026 gonna be lit
Haddonfield IL horror
Man... that voiceover is bad, the graphics are bad, animation is bad, acting is bad. This is a big oof.
Gun does not deserve this IP after what they did to Texas Chainsaw
🔥🔥
The moment we saw that Gun was involved in this it was over, they’re collecting Horror IPs and killing them off like they’re infinity stones.
Send that narrator back to acting school it quite literally sounds like he is reading his script and just that.
“Get loomis a voice acting coach” “Fix that goofy run” Dudes don’t even know the characters mouths didn’t even movie when they talked on Friday the 13th, this is about fun with friends, you’ll see! This about to smack
Been waiting years for a Micheal Myers game 🙏 and it’s Gunn + John carpenter, I have high hopes. Hopefully it’s as fun as Friday the 13th, I remember that also had a single player. We’re getting peak next year ✌️
Why's so many people already saying goofy shi when it's just a game trailer?.. Sheesh many of you are pathetic
If this is similar to Friday the 13th, this game will be hot!  Friday the 13th was one of my favorites games. Texas Chainsaw was ok, but wasnt biggest fan of 4 vs 3 setup.
his head seemed huge
COOL HALLOWEEN THE GAME TRAILER I CAN`T WAIT BUT NO NINTENDO SWITCH ☹😞☹💔😞💔
Was the voice over paid $2 for this? And did they run out of budget for that running animation? Lol
PLEASE get the actor playing Loomis a dialect coach. That was painful to listen to.
We waiting for that shit
finally!
Yah
SIGN.........ME......UPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP! I still miss F13
Any gameplay footage
Yes please😮🙏🔥
Is this supposed to be the new Friday the 13th game people was talking about 2 weeks ago?
They turned this iconic movie into a game! Its gonna be killer!
Who greenlit this trailer?
i rlly hope this doesnt end up like friday the 13th...
Hellraiser and Halloween?!?! Hell fucking yeah!!!
Gun media 😅
OH NAH I GOTTA EDIT DIS ONE
Can someone explain why the graphics are absolutely garbage this supposed to be a new game but it’s looking like it’s not even done with production yet ai games are horrible anymore 🥱 😂
Single-player  campaign  ok 👍🏻
its about damn time
Lets go. Love that sound
Another Friday the 13th but this game Halloween is bad ass let's have some fun GTA 6 and Halloween u can't go wrong let's keep these games alive as much as GTA
Is this real or fan made
i Hope we are Michael Myers as Playable Charakter and we have to hunt and search 😁👍🎉
💯Coppn' this
He's either too thin or the mask is too big for him.
Why are you all slating Gun Media❓
Yall think ts a fucking game
Friday the 13th is back baby
let's hope this one doesn't get deleted too once the rights of Halloween run out
God forbid that the fate of Friday the 13th game does not repeat
What's with the PS2 animation?
Yoiooo this is great, do you think you play Michael?
there is already a game of this now its multiplayer? wow
RIP Donald Pleasence 💀🎃(+witch) don't know who this narration is supposed to be..but if its meant to be Dr. Samuel Loomis then shame on you
We all know what should be next after this: A Nightmare on Elm Street
YES!!! BOUT DARN TIME...
another franchise for gun media to mess up
these studios are known for abandoning their games, this is gonna be another bait and switch cash grab from them.
0:57 Chase dat ass down with a Birthday cake knife music! 😊
That theme will always give me goosebumps!❤🔥
This game is not friday the 13 Killer is Maichel Mayers
Don't yall get scared playing them games lol soon as Michael pops out I'm tossing the controller 🎮🎧😂
Next is Nightmare on Elm Street. Jason Voorhees, Leathrface, Michael Myers have now their own horror survival multiplayer games. Well they all are now in Dead by Daylight.    I haven't multiplayer subscription for whole 5 years now.
So new Mike got gout!? With that limp 😂
Ohhhh    Myyy    Godddd
Who would you play as? There's not really a winner...
Soooooo, is this gonna be a dead by daylight bs game or this gonna be an actual game? Trailer doesn't give you enough to go off of. Don't know if I should be excited or disappointed.
saw gun media and already know how this will go
What about Texas Chainsaw Massacre?
As much as i love the series (Nobody was asking for this) Consumers are way to quick to put faith in Gun Media everything they touch dies to some extent (They have no respect for the original source material besides adding Easter Eggs to there games) At this point i think they only exist as a "Front" to launder money  (One of the worst North American Publisher's in modern gaming) They claim it'll have a single player option (I doubt it they are just saying this for positive PR) Horror fans need to be more critical of stuff like this
Don’t get ur hopes up it’s made by GUN
I just hope its not some asymmetrical bullshit, im so tired of that
Holy f**king sh*t 😮
HAHAHAHAHA  Gun. Helped make it? Yeaaaaah after what they did to TCM... Damn they got some stones in that studio.  Everyone do yourself a favor, if you aren't familiar with Gun. Go ahead and watch a couple videos on how good they were with Texas Chainsaw. Do not support these clowns.
Hmmm if I get this game, should I play it at night with all of the lights off?
So we're just going to forget the fate of F13 and TCM? Lmao
Holy shiii👀
alright i see u
After Gun. studios previous history, why tf would anyone buy this next game, only for it to be abandoned.
2026...you can't do this to us
They doint learn...
Dang I was hoping it would be like Friday the 13th tbh
I love 😊this game trailer but doe’s anyone know the voice of the narrator is 🤨
Cool, but I don't see how it is possible to make it into a great single player game.. Even the trailer was lackluster honestly
Oh boy another licensed game from Gun. Surely they won't berate their playerbase then abandon it like they did TCM...
KEEP IN MIND THIS IS MADE BY ILLFONIC; SLATED TO BE DEAD MONTH OR 2 AFTER LAUNCH. BE ADVISED.
Tombstone Michael Incoming?
Oooooo this is gonna be good
Rly DBD killer
Think about all the skins I need the Halloween kills skin
Those animations are top notch; this will surely be the greatest game of all time.
Is this fr?
Sold , if it's single player and decent amount of gameplay, Aslong as it's not cheesy like Friday the 13th single player lol that was a waste
Hope the community won't be extremely toxic like similar games
OMG not Illfonic and GUN they make trash.
Подарок судьбы

Guys, remember what GUN did to F13 and TCM. Enough said.
Weird, I suddenly care about video games.
Damn 2026 I thought it will come out this year
0:56 Lowkey forgot everyone was a baddie in the 70's and 80's
Man Im glad they are doing single player.
oooh ym goooood, I think im gonna---..... im crying, is this real? cant believe it, finally
Yessss❤❤❤
why is he so small??? His shoulders should be bulky and he should be way taller then that
Laurie: "It WAS the the boogeyman!"   "Dr. Loomis: "as amatter of fact it was."
Finally!  They thought they were surprised in 1978 about movie sells.  This will sell like hotcakes!
The single player is interesting, but the fact that GUN is tied to it means I’m not buying it.
gun is just gonna abandon the game just like they did for Friday the 13th and for Texas chainsaw massacre im not supporting this.
Aw man I wish this was coming in 2025
That mask looks crappy and not scary enough. Hope they include all the masks and body types from every film and make them look gritty and realistic
🤤
GUN MEDIA dam its been awhile
Why are his shoulders so puny?
Now I'm waiting for them to bring back Friday the 13th.
Hoping this is good 🤞🏾
Gun media? They got blasted by the lawsuit from Friday the 13th the game which I'm still mad about and they're still at it?
Gun... oh god. it'll be dead in a year of release from abandonment before they jump onto a Freddy game.
read the description YOU HAVE TO CUT THE PHONE LINES this is gonna be awesome, like 30 minutes of setup then you get on your mass murder spree
hopefully there is a skin to make him more chunky, i don’t remember the old movies that well but he just looks a bit weird that skinny.
It's look like texas Chin saw
if there are Gun Interactive and IllFonic, dont buy that game. it will be dead in 3 months . We saw that with friday 13th and texas
Considering how they treat literally every other license, I give it about a year lifespawn if I’m hopeful
YES. PLEASE GUN. AND ILLFONIC BLESS US LIKE YOU DID WITH F13!!!!
Gun and Ilfonic logo are like death signals…we know how long this game will last unfortunately with how TCM & Killer Klowns was treated.
I’m getting, I’m getting, I’m getting
i waiting this game
Fine,no "story mode",so we're gonna get bored after a few matches,am I wrong?
Ugh I wannabe so hyped for this but man IllFonic does not support the life cycle of its games Friday the 13th got pulled and Killer Klowns from outer Space is barely holding on with very little support the games are extremely fun but die out too soon not enough events or maps to keep people involved
That music is right on point a thousand percent.. ✅✅✅ 😂 that's why this advertiser got so many likes
Thought it was gonna be another F13
Oh no. Gun please don't make this a asymetric horror game. We don't need these anymore.
Should have been given to supermassive games to make it.
Hopefully this game doesn’t turn out like Texas chainsaw massacre
I loved the Friday the 13th game! I hope this is like that!
I hope single player is the main campaign because if not as happy as I am to see this trailer I will not get it . I hate the temporary cash grab crap they pull with the asymmetrical horror gun media and illfonic pulls with every game once the player base dies you can't play anymore then the servers are going to get turned off and then you are stuck with nothing. I hate these two Companies all they do is exploit and waste the potential of the franchises there's no longevity and there strategy is to milk horror franchises back to back. You won't even be able to go back and play the game years later if no one else is playing it . By signing up for this you are further letting devs know it's ok to get you to pay for games and then to snatch them away from you when they can't bleed your wallets any further. I'll pass on them con artist.
Bruh I want to play this game. But I hate that Gun is a part of this, after what they did with TCM how would I know they wont do this again??
I have hope, but i don't have faith. But i have hopes.
If it’s anything like the robocop game but stalker killer vibes rather than superhero cop this game could be soooo good. That game makes you feel just like robocop so if this game can do that with Michael then we’re good to ho
i hope the final version is more gruesome than this, it looks kind of disney, but still super stoked for it.
get gun off this game and maybe it'll have a chance
I wonder how long this will last compared to Jason and tcm
We might get a Halloween game before Gta 6 😭
GUN? Are you serious????????
We got Twink Michael Myers in this game 😂😂😂 Theu need to make him taller and MUCH more broad shouldered. The dude is 6 feet 7 inches tall. Im 6 foot 6. I make any normal girl or dude look tiny, but in this Michael looks damn near the same height. He doesn't look intimidating at all. And that mask, why is it so big?
im honestly hoping for alien isolation vibes here, single player. complete objectives, maybe end with killing him. that would be sick
Sdiybt 💔💔
This is awesome the man getting his own game!!!
I wish I could play as Michael Myers here, not a random victim running around to escape him.
Dont Screw it Up!!!
are you the slasher or the babysitter?
The introducing voice is absolutely terrible, i hope the game won't evolve cringe stories like "Halloween ends", awful movie
I need a story driven horror game, please be good🤞🏻
as excited as i am I fear this will have the same fate as tcm but  hey atleast were gonna get singleplayer
😴
When I hear that theme song I get so happy all of a sudden!
The game looks stunning! Until I saw Laurie Strode run out the door like a quirky gimp. Still pumped! And I really hope Gun does good with Halloween and listens to the player community. I’d hate to see this game suffer from the same problems Texas Chainsaw had.
am i the only one that thinks the mask looks a little too big on the character model
W HALLOWEEN
Gun.
Just saw the trailer and i got chills ♨️
Gotta say.... It's fantastic
I’m actually interested!
Bro I need to play as Michael, nothing better than traumatizing babysitters.
they cut texas chainsaw for this. wish they bring it back in the future.
They call themselves Gun because they shoot themselves in the foot everytime they make something
I was super excited until I saw it was the development team behind Friday the 13th and Texas chainsaw massacre..... Do they really not have any other devs that want to make a game with these classic horror franchises?    I really want to be excited because I love Halloween but you know the saying, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me, fool me 3 times I need to jump off a bridge 😂😂
Sweet all we need now is a Scream game and a Night on Elm Street game. A Hills have Eyes game would be pretty dope as well
I need to play this
Can we get a Michael Myers goes to Washington DC to deliver "Strong Medicine " to the swamp of Corruption!
I got the ring tone I’m too miked out 😂
Another Texas chainsaw type game lmao its not gonna be good i can already tell😂 yall are so gullible
Dead by daylight ass cutscene😂😂
Good job on single player, but I hate to say it but Dead by Daylight wins the genre, only because it's whole collection of killers gives some variety of gameplay.  One franchise can't carry a game like this for long.
Eww, Illfonic are we only going to be able to enjoy this for a little over a year before you wuss out on this project like you had no reason to for Friday The 13th? Literally had nothing to do with the lawsuit and wasted everyone’s money and time with wasted hype on that shitshow
I cannot wait ❤❤❤
I'm in. NGL the Friday game (even with the bugs) was fun as hell. Too bad the player base got goofy later on. Once it got more polished, for the price tag, it was a riot.
Before Friday the 13th the game and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre the game already got released but i can’t wait for Halloween the game is getting release.
YES!!! 🎃
I better get to play as Michael myers and free roam the area breaking into random houses at will with realistic violence.
Just give me a scream game please
Need a story mode fr 😮‍💨😮‍💨
JOHN CARP IS HELPING. W
This trailer is so bad. Compare it to Hellraiser trailer.
R.I.P., Donald Pleasance.  With respect to this VA, it just ain’t the same.
Friday the 13th desurved better!!
Only Scared of GUN
No please not like dead by daylight 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🙈🙈
1:02 jar jar binks!!
Michael Myers !
Fuck yeah!!
I can’t say enough how bad these devs handle their games. I really hope they don’t ruin this with the amount of bugs and unpolished mechanics they always have on launch for their other online games but since this is single player we shouldn’t worry about that now, right?
Why Halloween 89 movie
I hope they have every version of Michael playable from old to new movies
Is it me or does the voice over sound like A.i
otro dbd
Only thing that sucks about this is that Gun. is part of it 😑  I’m super excited though! 😁
Still better than the Loomis from Kills.
Another game to lose it's license and be dead
So do you actually play as Michael ? Or one of the teens trying to survive ?
Is this gonna be another dead by daylight bullshit ass game?
another texas chainsaw massacre type of game
Those graphics look pretty crap for a cinematic intro...
Im not into gaming but this got me excited.  Ill play im friggin 52 years old.  Im a big john carpenter fan. Simply the best director there is.
This and hellraiser single player horror games finally can we get a Friday the 13th and nightmare on elm street single player games now as well hell chucky would be cool as well there are so many that would work
Single player lmao??
I saw this displayed outside of YT, hovering under the app on PS5. I clicked on it, and without reading it, I immediately said *"If this is a game, then it's DAY ONE."*  The video starts, I see it's by IGN and all I said was *"day one."*
😲😲😲👻
This makes me so happy
Is this  ‘Legos Halloween’ ? wtf are these characters ?
HE HAS TOMBSTONE
I prayed for times like this.
We’re so back!
Not looking good
Forget a video game....how about they put that time and effort itnto fix and remaking that LAST Halloween movie and give Micheal Myers the flowers that he deserves!!!!!!
People aren’t realizing that the Halloween franchise won’t let this game die. If it has Malek Akkad and John Carpenter attached to the game, they’re doing everything they can to make this thing perfect
Please better than Texas Chain Saw but not flop like Friday the 13th!!!!
His shoulders a little to narrow looking he needs to feel like he towers over the player a bit.
Can't wait but geezus put some love on Dr. Loomis voice! Sounds horrendous 😂
Fix bro's shoulders bruh
illfonic and gun together on a game you know it's gonna be great
Michael Myers "I always come back"
i really hope we get a dbd killer. wee need something better than that poop game.
Yeah,I'm so ready for this!
Please let us play as Michael and free roam and please have a good campaign and please don’t be like the Friday the 13th game 🙏
Otra IP legendaria será arruinada por Gun
Now I won’t be able to sleep 😭😭😭
Now all we need is ghostface stand alone game
Yes….yeeess…….Yeeeeeeeeesssss…….YYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS!!!!!!! FINALLY A GAME OF HALLOWEEN/MICHAEL MYERS!!!!!!! YEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSS
A game made by GUN, oh what could go wrong
😮😮😮
Please make it like Friday the 13th and not like dead by daylight
No disrespect hopefully the makers have the permission to use anything Halloween or hopefully this is made by the people who made Halloween because I don't want anything like Friday the 13 game was amazing skins amazing but unfortunately got removed for not having rights to the other versions of Jason
I'm pre-ordering this as soon as I can
Need another movie.
It's appalling that so many people will still support Gun despite knowing how they treated both F13 and TCM.
His head is out of proportion with his body.
NO FUCKING WAY I JUST SEEN THIS RN
I already know the game probably gone die within 2-3 years just like Friday the 13th or TCM but I'm still enjoying the Michael Myers experience
Thank God it's not DBD. FINALLLYYY
So bummed gun never gave us fans of Friday the 13th a single player experience.
that voiceover is so bad. you couldn't fork over a 50 spot for some guy on fiverr and just had an in house guy who said he could probably do it take a crack at it and totally shit the bed or what
Ouuuuuuuuu u can’t kill the boogeyman headahhhhhhhhhh
Ps5 or not ??
It’s made by gun wrap it up
se nao for ruim, legal :)
Let me guess this game is gonna die after two years
Is this?? I remember seeing a demo for a fan made Halloween game years ago. Is the same game?
“Oh man this looks cool!”  *sees Gun. made this*  “Nevermind.”  TCM never forget.
As much as I love halloween and horror games.... This looks bad.
I am sooooooo there
Great another Horror IP Gun interactive is gonna exploit and forget about 3 months after release
This looks and sounds like it was made entirely with AI besides the music
This looks so bad. Still waiting on my art book for the F13 Kickstarter, Gun. How's that coming along?
Can't wait for Scream or Child's Play next!
Theme song is such a banger. Could you imagine being in the studio while they were cooking that up 😭😭😭
🎃
Micheal is intimidating and all but if one single person had a gun and was competent enough to use it, a lot of bad stuff couldve been avoided lmao
Wow😯🔥🎮
As a 37 year old who had gotten into horror movies with the original Halloween movie at a young age, all I have to say is: FUCK YES!! GTA 6 and an actual Halloween game in the same year? 2026 is looking pretty fucking good
Uh yeah I’m never trusting gun again😊
Wat game system will this be on?
I thought this was movie
I’m so excited like a big ass kid ❤❤❤❤❤
I got flashbacks of toxic players who team up with Jason Vorhees. Unlocking doors, calling out locations to him, withholding car keys and phone fuses, blocking doorways, trapping windows, running teammates over or driving passengers to him. I hope this game can somehow avoid toxic players like that.
Wtf take my money 💰
1:25 never gets old
I wonder if Jamie Lee Curtis approves this
Próximo juego qué va a ser abandonado por gun 🤑 y lo mejor sera leer su comunicado patético dé "Creemos qué el juego ah alcanzado su máximo potencial." En fin, proximo Tcm.
I have been waiting for this. I still play the Atari 2600 game. I just hope you can play both sides in single player. Sure it's fun killing people.... but its more fun to run from the killer. Thats what was missing from Friday The 13th and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I hope on top of the single player story.... that we can play offline as survivors  too.
Gun is involved, automatic no.
Myers cambaleando não da não mkkkkkk
Jesus that running animation is rough.
Bruh why they make him so scrawny 😭😭. Makes him not even look scary
Why they do homie like that? Doesn’t even look scary with that big ol’head.   Reminds me of that clip where that kid dressed as Michael Myers falls of the hay stack and stays in character. 😂
Dashie gon fw this
Por favor que sea mejor que el trailer
Finally game developers are listening.....SINGLE PLAYER horror movie games
Yessss thank you Halloween 👻🎃
0:44 completely kills the imitation...movement in the trailer looks choppy asf, From 1:17-1:19 she literally slides to the front door. This is the most narrow #$## Michael  i've ever seen....Since when has Michael looked that small.....If this was going for getting people excited it definitely failed it'll fall on its face especially with Gta6 getting released in the same year....I guess we'll see.
This is gonna be interesting 🔥
This and Hellraiser single player ganes that arent just dead by daylight finally! Yes!
Omg fr? Yess fuck yes
Usk
So michael is getting his own video game, i remember friday the 13th and jason got their own video game, i never played it myself but I heard it was interesting, who's the next guy to get his own game freddy krueger!?
This game in VR would be amazing!!!
These animations a F-- awful
Why is there a British Narrator?
Hopefully it's like alien isolation single player
I'm just curious to know what the SP will be like. Glad it's there because I get hyped seeing a horror IP being made in to a game only to find out it's going to be a DBD copy. I'm hoping the SP is quality.
Can't Wait To play this
This game looks incredible, multiplayer as Michael is going to be awesome
Iconic. Definelty a must have game
Yes!!! Finally I have been waiting for this game for years. Thank you! ❤
OMG!
Looks like dog shit 😆
This is the game I have dreamed of! Freakin' Awesome!
Everyone so hyped about single player over multiplayer like it won’t get old after a while not everyone is a recluse introvert weirdo who doesn’t socialize 😂
I'm excited for this, gun knows how to launch a good horror game experience. But maintaining it is another thing, I hope that they've learned from Friday the 13th and Texas chainsaw.
Dr Loomis was lame. The music though.....never ever forget that music.
BRO I'm kinda hyped for this game
This looks terrible
At least I can out run him
oh look its Friday the 13th all over again
Its like the friday the 13th game all over again. Im excited:)
Is everyone missing that it says single player  and multiplayer horror experience?
Great… GUN is involved, the same clowns who abandoned Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Animations look so chopped as well.
Good God, that narration sounded fantastic made. The whole trailer seemed fan made.
The audio is broken on this video
Singleplayer?  By Jove! Is unheard of in this era!
Oh I can think of a few things for starters try a 12 gauge shotgun 😂😂😂😂
Hopefully you can play as Big Mike.
Jamie lee Curtis GOTTA be a skin to buy on this game it’s only right😭
@theradbrad Yo check this out.
As a horror fan, thank you. We don't get enough all time classic horror films being made into games these days
That is an AWFUL Loomis impression! 😂
Its up to John Wick at this point
The narrator 😂😂
as always there has to be multiplayer
Wait IVE PLAYED THESE GAMES BEFORE
Why is his head 3 times bigger than it should be
@GUN! For the love of GOD, PLEASE PLEASE make the queue up like Fortnite. It is completely unfair to keep pitting the solo queue crowd against groups of 4. It takes absolutely nothing at all to separate the SoloQ players from the teams. So just SEPARATE Queues. It’s a very simple request. TCM is completely unplayable now, everyone REFUSES to play Soloq so you either get abandoned by your team or every single game is a 3v1. Like, seriously, just make it so soloq doesn’t have to get paired against losers
Fresh new youtube game content
OST will forever be goated. that ominous, eerie feeling. I don't get scared from anything horror related, but if I heard this shit in real life, I AM RUNNNINGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
Great another game Gun will abandon
It's going to be like a Friday the 13th the game situation
Omg
I’m getting every version of this game idc🎃♾️🤞🏾
This is a going to be a DBD-esc cash grab. Nothing more. I would love to be proven wrong, but in the gaming community, we've seen it all before. A game adaptation of a movie with a huge fan base that basically just finds a new way to collect money from the old idea. Then after the have the money, they ride off into the sunset. The game stops all development, and dies.
Fuck man...the way he walked to the door as the theme dropped!!
The single player mode will just end up being the asymmetrical format but with bots, no thanks. Gun is a terrible company.
Xbox PlayStation or just pc ?
Will it be available for xbox one
Were any humans involved in making this?
I just want a left for dead 3 and I'll die happy.
😮😮
Finally someone that cares about a single player experience.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🎃🔪
If this game is like dead by daylight, I'm going to pass
Single player experience means nothing. You will just play the multiplayer game against AI. Hard pass.
It already looks like trash. The walking animation looks terrible, and everything about it screams another flop. Yeah, no thanks.
They did Friday and Texas chainsaw about time Halloween came out
Its not gonna beat  dead by daylight scratch mirror Myers in a indoor map .
This game looks fire I miss Friday the 13th so this will be even better with Michael Myers!
Isn't this by the same people who abandoned their past MULTIPLE games? Texas Chainsaw Massacre being the most recent? Pretty sure they ignored the community for the game and then just abandoned it. Anyone reading this, wait a year after launch and then see if the game is already dead. Don't waste your money.
If this game is true to the movie, my life is complete😊
Their narration is terrible😅
They completely ruined Friday the 13th: The Game and then abandoned it. Same thing with Texas Chainsaw Massacre that game wasn’t even scary. The mechanics felt clumsy, the yellow aura ruined any tension, and there were no real jump scares at all. It just felt like a waste. Now that’s two major horror franchises abandoned and dead. And now they’re hyping up a Michael Myers game? Yeah, no thanks.
I'm here for this!!!!!
🔥🎃The Darkest Eye's!🎃🔥
Gunna be dead by dawn
@1:01 you can see him in the window already in the house she's going to... scary
Hell yeah why isn't this coming out this year 😢 im 35 im to old to wait another year. But in love with Halloween 🎃 🤪
I absolutely love that she left her neighbor's door open after crying of a killer chasing her🙄😂
So is this for console or pc ?
Single player is music to my ears!🎃
Also, I hope we get alternate costumes for Michael 🤞😬🤞. Personally, my favorite look is the Rob Zombie costume. What is yours?
I NEED THIS GAME
I got a feeling this is gonna be so bad 😢 my expectations are dirt low I hope I’m wrong
This look ai
I hope the ‘motivated lighting’ is more accurate in the actual game play.  With Micheal steps onto the porch his face is illuminated from above (too look really cool, of course) but it makes no sense because there is no light source (or the source is not turned on) and when the people run out of the house they aren’t lit up…. So why does the lighting change for Michael? To look cool (but makes no sense).
For everyone born in this era of horror movies and in the 90s just like y'all this trailer brings me back in time 🤭😁 oh the music the feels got damn we are in for a treat with this game .
GUN. will ruin it like they do all there games!
I Hope It Has Kinda The Same Vibe F13 Did. Like Have Every Location From Each Movie. And Micheal’s Mask Should Age Like The Movies Too! And If There Was A Halloween 4 Map. The Main Characters Should Be Jamie And Rachel If There Was A Map For Each Movie. The Main Characters Should Be The Main Characters From That Movie Yk
Now we just need a ghostface game
WHERE DO I SIGN UP  Just hook it too the Vein~\!!
THIS IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯  I just hope there is a story and great and innovative gameplay 🤞😬🤞
Don’t care if it’s $150.00 I’ll make sure to pre order!
this concerns me. looking back at the fates of the friday the 13th and texas chainsaw massacre games, i don’t know how this one will avoid a similar situation. here’s hoping the single player experience is amazing
Gunmedia cant kill a singleplayer game lets hope
My question is why does he never run like does he do it to aura farm
That person will be just fine when you tell him/her no. Even God hears all prayers but he doesn’t answer the same.
Ugh, the fake Donald Pleasance accent...
First Hellraiser and now this. Yes please.
I can't believe we got a Michael Myers horror game before GTA 6
Wow... Another new game that looks like it's being played on a console from 10 years ago 😢😢😢
Wow, I can't believe I predicted a Myers game after many years of DBD and other spin-offs like killer klowns, Texas chainsaw massacre, Ash evil dead and Friday the 13th.
I'm just happy it's different from Jason, Evil Dead, and TCM. Those games are boring without a traditional single player mode. Enough said.
Let’s gooo
This game will be a reflection of TCM. The developers will drop support after two months.
He's going to Michael his Myers 🔥🔥🔥🔥
They gonna abandon this game in a week and then launch a trailer for nightmare on elm street for you silly people to get all hype again. It’s a shame.
Spoilers: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  But they did kill the boogeyman, in the dumbass movie called Halloween Ends. Honestly they ruined the image of an incredible monster!
Character models look atrocious
Boooating 🗣️
Id rather have friday the 13th back fuck Michael Myers im so sick of halloween all the movies suck ass im sure the game will. I hope it suffers the same fate as friday eventually.
Michael Myers looks terrible😒big head on a toddler body is crazy!!! With the amount of money they could have at least made him look 100x better!!!
I tired of all these Halloween movie I thought it was over with
Playing a horror game as William shatner is gonna be a thrill
Man this game looks awesome don't try to have the same fate the Jason game did
They got a year to get it right for micro transactions..lol
*TO ALL OF YOU PEOPLE WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT TCM AND EVIL DEAD AND TALKING SHIT IN THE SUBREDDITS* It's time to put your money where your mouth is.
Lets goo
gun media dnv pqp
Jason vorhees 2.0
LETS GOO
Not only are we getting a Hellraiser game written by Clive Barker himself along with pinhead being voiced by the actor who played pinhead in the movie Doug Bradley we’re getting 2 Games From John Carpenter a Halloween :flushed: Game being one of them :fire::fire::fire:
oh Gun is behind this? it'll be garbage
🙄So the game will be abandoned within a year like all their horror games? They have an actual record we can’t ignore at this point
The problem with games like dead by daylight, they set it up for the player to lose when they run faster they can’t die when you’re the villain  They started messing around with the Texas chainsaw, massacre games as well and evil dead where it’s more in favor for the villains to win so in other words, they weren’t balanced games   I hope Halloween fair is so much better because I thought the only fair balance game was Friday the 13th  game
Is it bad that I just want a single player game where you’re Michael? Make it like Hitman or something akin
I'll be honest i rather play the single player if the multiplayer of the game die  I don't know what industry is creating this game but hope a lot for the best
.
Lol another game by these guys eh? Itll be fun for a couple months and then the community will cease to exist
Why does Michael walk like he's seriously constipated?
I’ll definitely be sticking with single player only but I hope it’s good! Excited to see it
If they don’t nail Nick Castle’s walk in the game, then it’s not Michael Myers
Terrible animations, awful  acting and WTF is going on with the size of Myers’s head 😂😂😂
Is this original voices, if yes I guess Donnie's kids get a nice wee payday?
Wow you guys just covering everything
I Hope the pre order comes with the SHUT DOWN date.
Co published by gun😢 think I'll wait at least 6 months before trying this out. I had high hopes for TCM and look how that turned out
So bad 😂
Trailer Gave me goosebumps.
Micheal looked a bit small.  Hope he's a larger imposing force.
Why not drop it on Halloween???
Oh hell yeah. Whoever is voicing Loomis could have done better, but overall it's hard to really copy Pleasance's version of the character. This is gonna be awesome.
I wish it was survival horror like resident evil.
Look I’m excited but yall gone have to go back to the drawing board why his head so damn big Lmaoo and his body so small
Halloween bout to Blow Up thanks to DBD! Man I Love DBD!!
Singleplayer? Now I'm curious
Is It Gonna Be On The Xbox series x ?
What's with the narrator? He freaking sucks, I couldn't take the trailer seriously because of him
Jason: Killem bro
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can’t wait to play this!
Hell yeah I cannot wait for this. I've been pretending I was Michael Myers since 1999 Grand theft Auto III. Now he's come home 🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻
The music is absolutely legendary. The very first sound sends a shiver up your spine.
W for Single player Games
Let me guess… it’s another dead by daylight kind of game
Omg finally. I have been waiting for this for like 25 years.
Another horror game gunned down. That’s Gun Violence.
hopefully this will be on Xbox and ps5 I will buy
We need a sandbox style small/medium open world where we play as him. Please.
Please don’t come out on December 30 2026😭
Let's Gooo!🎃🔪
hope we got scratch myers or tombstone myers
Character movements looks horrible 😂😂
Gettin it.
Best horror movie music ever man.  So fucking eerie.
I saw GUN and have a feeling this game is going to be D.O.A. gonna kill another horror Icon game lol
HELL YEAH!!!! 🎉🎉🎉 LETS GO HACK UP SOME PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T LOVE US RIGHT 😂
Nightmare on Elm Street game next? With Robert England reprising the voice of Freddy and Heather Landercamp back as Nancy.
Give it a year then they shut down the servers. Best $70 you’ll spend
I sense t bagging in Micheal myers future by numerous victims door slamming him
And.... in a couple of years they will shut the servers off like they did my boy Jason 😑
Alright I'm invested in how this goes and we have a whole nother year
Micheal is my favorite monster
My favorite movie and theme ever
This game will live for 9 months and then die.
1:36 I Like How It Perfectly Transitions From Michael, To The Pumpkin Looking Like The Opening Credits Of The Film.
@dashie @dashie DASHIE PLSSS
Gunn 💀 Illfonic
Why does Loomis sound drunk?
Everything about this trailer is bad. The 2005 animation, the terrible Donald Pleasance impersonation, the awful Michael Myers, they didn't have to make this so why are they?
Oh thank God, I thought it was another movie.. At this point those things come out once a year like Call of Duty.
As long as it doesn't hit a rights train like Friday the 13th did it should be fine.
Is Gordon Ramsay voicing Loomis?
Well that's.... something I guess. Did they make this in 2005? The animation reminds me of the Evil Dead game from that year
We need a Nightmare on elm street game with a GTA type open world with Cinematic graphics for Dream kills and Nightmare interactions.  With Cross over people showing up Like  Jason Vorhees  And Ash from Evil dead And  Pinhead from Hellraiser.  A game where you get to slaughter & torture teenagers.  Sleep & awake  Promote fear in schools to get more powers!  I would buy this game if executed right!
This looks awful. 😂
Please have this not be another dead by daylight clone
How do they expect us to beat this game cuz he just won't die
Will your bets repeat the fate of Friday the 13th?
How do we get this game?? How can I play it ??
But who’s the payer character?! The final girl or Michael?!
After the disaster with Texas chainsaw I’m hoping they actually stick to this!
I bet it’s another friday the 13th type of game.
Once GTA6 drops, every other game is fucked 0:48
You can't kill the boogie man call John wick
1:30 - 1:42 that. Was. Fire.
Everyone who calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved. Romans 10:13, Jesus Christ is Lord! God bless you all! 🙏
Do we get to play as Michael or just survivors
I WAS TALKING ABOUT WANTING A HALLOWEEN 1974 GAME WITH MY FRIEND THAT ISNT THE NES ONE NOW ITS REAL!???
better be absolute banger
I hope Dbd wont lose the licence to Myers when this drops...
Laurie strode DOOP
Hellraiser, Now This!
Hopefully it's like Friday the 13th. I miss that game
Walking simulator
WHAAAT THIS IS A MOMENT IN HISTORY SOMEONE TAKE A PICTURE!!!!!!!
As soon as the theme song hits the boys know to start grooving and busting it down 🗣️🔥🔥 Can’t wait to play this!
I was excited at first… then I saw the graphics
OOOOO I HOPE ITS GORY  Pleeeease please be like the Friday the 13th game!
The Halloween theme is so iconic. 🎃
So will this actually be a story or just online??
There better be a guy following my every move with this theme music just behind me where I can hear yhe soft patter of their feet, but I can't ever catch the person who is making that noise...if only I could catch him and put this evil creature to rest.
please get a better voiceover before release for Loomis, this sounds like AI ☠
I've been waiting for a new Halloween game for SOOO long y'all have no idea. However... Someone needs to put Illfonic & Gun in time out from making games based on iconic horror
Simple but effective, I dig it
let's be honest, everyone will play this for a bit then go back to dbd and just play as him in dbd lol
Take all my money 💵 now !!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
OMG CORYXKENSHIN AND THE BOYS JUMP ON THIS WITH RDCWORLD PLEASE. LOL
Yes the game I've been waiting for.
wow
I aint playing any other game till gta comes out 😂
The single player option is interesting. I won't play unless I have someone with me though lmao
Illfonic! 🤮
Another one of those like Friday the 13th with a small single player part and a big multiplayer part. I want a full on single player horror game with a famous killer. Come on devs.
I wish illFonic and Gunmedia made all the horror games. They put SO much effort into F13 that Texas Chainsaw massacre and Killer Klowns from outerspace just never meet. IlFonic participate into Killer Klowns but as u can see its just mid. F13 was SO god damn good that i sont even think Halloween will live up to the funny goofy moments and just pure chaos that F13 gave me. Heres to hopeing 🍻
Close enough welcome back Friday the 13th
Oh how I miss  Friday
Playing this and having the movies on in the background on a surround system? Count me in!
Better not be like dead by daylight
The narration is terrible, doesn’t fit with the horror theme at all
He’ll yes
Why why why would Illfonic ever partner with Gun again? Smh  This looks so goofy lmao no thanks, not spending another dime on another dead game in the making 👎🏻
Oh god, not Gun again. RIP Texas Chainsaw look what they did to my boy </3
Mikey is back
Mamba mentality
Good Christ this looks abysmal 😂😂😂
That looks and sounds like complete trash. Why they gotta do Michael like that? Low effort af. 😢
Why is Behaviour adding an old chapter a second time?
Hopefully this one is good because every other 80's horror movie game has been just another dead by daylight clone hopefully they do something different
this ain’t UE5 is it??? holy graphics
How much wanna bet games gonna be like $130.   80 bucks for standard edition
Looks like an indie game 😮
I pray this game won't end up like TCM and F13 game
The fact we have to advertise Single Player like it's a revolutionary feature shows just how far the industry has fallen.
Ok, so obviously this lasts a month, tops, and then Gun ruins it.  Ignoring that fact, this trailer fucking suuuuuucks.  The voiceover is bad, the graphics are bad, the animation is bad, etc.  I don't think there's a single element of it that is executed well. The only thing it has going for is that people can clap like seals because they remember the movie.
Bro, why is everyone saying solo? It clearly said single and multiplayer experience, and evil dead and Friday the 13th had single player and multiplayer modes
It will suck.
Never forget the hype the “Jason” game and “Texas chainsaw” game got. 😂
Someone please tell me where rhis game is & the name please
absolute PEAK
I was here.
BABBBBBY I JUST FUCKING LOVE HALLOWEEN , MICHEAL , OCTOBER UGGGGH YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
2026? Why even show us this atm?
Can yall all calm TF down! Stop hyping up games you haven’t even played yet
Why would the release date not be this October smh
Horrible animation
With all due respect to the devs…… *WTF* is this bs man!??! Where are the SO CALLED next gen games at? I’m so sick of seeing these same old souls/So called open world/loot for upgrades/Chinese lore bs ass games bro! So sick of it! It’s such bs! We as fans need to take a stand and demand next gen content! Gotdamn PS5 has been out for 5 fkn years and this is the best they can do? wtf happened to that matrix game? Y’all rember that teaser they gave us in 2020. Or what about that game they showed “wiTh LuMeN and aBiLLi0N tRiaNglEs” rember that game? WHERE IS IT? wtf happened to those games? The only game we have had that starts to scratch the surface of next gen was wukong (salute to those guys and THANK YOU) as for these other devs and gaming companies idk wtf they got going on… Ragnarok was a complete let down, ratchet and clank, astros playroom? wtf are we 8 year olds? I want next gen something we haven’t seen before something that pushes the ps5 to its limit. And speaking of pushing the limit, What’s the point of the ps5 pro? Can someone anyone please tell me WHY TF DO WE HAVE A PS5 pro with NO NEXT GEN GAMES?! I’m so fkn done with Sony and this overrated PlayStation. I’m gonna change this bs. If your reading this and your with me, reply to this comment and come sign my petition to make Sony do right by its customers. We demand next gen content NOW! And stop showing us games that’s a year or two from releasing.
DEAD BY DAYLIGHT 👑 Friday The 13th 1️⃣3️⃣ Texas Chainsaw Massacre 🩸 Killer Clowns From Outer Space 🤡 Hellraiser ⛓️‍💥  Halloween 🎃   We’re eatingggg good 💯
Looks cool can't wait to play this , hopefully they can remake the thing video game just like this
Agree got them all and they fell come on Michael stay lol
"you cant kill the boogeyman" John Wick "hold my dog"
This A.I. loomis ass 🤣 please someone voice him but I'm excited in general
John carpenter is the full on director of the franchise and he approves of this, this game is here to stay for years to come unlike Friday the 13th, they're going to be very similar in gameplay since "GUN" is developing it💯
That music is so anxiety inducing
Why does it look like one those game ads made with AI? :/
I was hopeful for something as dedicated as the robocop games the multi-player has me worried.
0:23 🎉❤ 0:23
These graphics look terrible
Fckn amazing....
Okay, good, it's just a video game. For a second I thought it'd be another movie cuz that's all we need is another Halloween movie.
Friday the 13th is fun, looking forward to this too <add to cart>
Yall like garbage lol.
yea this game is dead on arrival because of gun studios
Idk if I want to trust gun with their past history IPs Friday the 13, Texas chainsaw massacre anyone??? Are there going to be a lot bugs OPs mechanics
Hard pass. Hard hard harrrrrrd pass. Lol I will never be buying a horror game ever ever again after killer klowns and tx chainsaw idc if it’s single player. It’s legit made by a company who def just fucked around for months on a shit budget
I know the Devs had problems in the past, but Carpenter is a part of this project. If he's on it, I don't think it will be total ass. I played F13 on release and had fun with it for what it was. Better not be $70. I think $30-$40 would be fair price.
It's not gonna be on Nintendo? Damn 😕
The fact that the director of the movie is a gamer nowadays and the executive producer of this game gives me a good feeling.
His long overdue DBD rework, alongside his own asym game... 2026 is shaping up to be a good year for Myers, so long as neither party screws it up
I'm happy there's a single player option. I feel like anything exclusively multiplayer gets pitted against dbd and suffers for it long term. I'm optimistic!
Playing Michael Myers’s on call of duty was better.
Needed this 😈
I didn’t even read the description.  I’m half awake &  I just glanced & thought they were making a new movie again.  When I noticed it was game I got a little e excited, but when I saw single player…I’m definitely picking it up.
I'm curious how the Single Game is going to play out?? I thought it was going to be like the Jason game, DAF!!!
Nah, heart sank when I saw the Gun logo. Still haven’t forgiven them for how they “supported” Friday the 13th. Glad I didn’t make the mistake of buying Texas Chainsaw Massacre and watch them do exactly the same.
Mikeys back lets go
Hellraiser game and now this?, god dammm, hope they make a propper Leatherface game too, or a Freddy Krueger game could also work in 1st person with the nightmares and all his stuff
C'est une cinématique et pourtant l'animation des personnages est très mauvaise 😬
Hellraiser now this!! Take my money.
Im so excited but damn them not getting this done by Halloween 2025 lol
Single player. Ohhh Helll yeahhh. It would of broken my heart and spirit if it was a danm co op
If it’s anything like Friday then it’s a hit
O my Gosh ...is thar William Shatner 😮☠️
The Guy From Fortnite! 😮
Will this be a first person or third person game ?
My favorite horror movie franchise!!! I'm getting this as soon as it releases!!
So….. where is the damn gameplay? This is just a commercial
2026?! Was hoping for this Halloween.
4:17 pm August 21st 2025
I’m about to watch this trailer for the first time
It looks bad
myers mó magrin, da nem medo
Please no rights issues!! Myers is my favorite slasher!
I can overlook the Loomis impression not being perfect, but couldn't they at least make him sound British?
Hope they get a vr version for it
Love horror games
Okay this makes me excited!!! A freaking Halloween game?! Plz be good
Awesome
Everyone’s movements in this is so robotic like I understand Micheal but the man and woman? All of their movements looked so whack 😭
Why wasn’t this recommended yesterday!?
This better be a great game for us 😤.
YESSSS so hype for this
Thank got it’s not another pvp game *shit nvm
sabalenka en finale ? j’y crois moyen
Is this going to be like a Friday the 13 game?
We need a freddy krueger videogame
Single player has my interest peaked for sure
Well shit I’m down if there’s single player
Dr Loomis skin incoming 🤣🫢😬
Single player as well? YES PLEASE 🙏
All this game needs to be successful, is just be a reskin of their Friday The 13th game and I’ll be more than satisfied!
The voice actor used is terrible wtf.
I got 300 hours on Texas and who knows how much on Friday the 13th, and it honestly pisses me off seeing the same cycle repeat. Gun Interactive who used to go by the name Gun Media puts their name on these games, but the actual work gets split with studios like IllFonic and Sumo. They all act like they’re “building something special” and then a couple years later the support gets cut, the servers get swapped, and players are just left hanging. Friday got screwed because of the license fight, but it still ended with Gun pulling the plug and walking away. Now Texas is shutting down too, not even lasting 2 full years of proper support. That’s hundreds of hours of people’s time and money just tossed aside while they move on to the next thing. At this point it feels like they cash in on hype, bleed the fanbase dry, then dip. Call it what you want, but it looks shady as hell. If you’re thinking about buying whatever Gun drops next, really think it through first. Don’t let them play you the same way they played us.
looks fire
Also why does Michaels mask look twice as big as everything else on him??
We will see….
Guys its the same devs as Friday the 13th and Killer Clowns from Outer Space. Its gonna die within a week
I hope they make him look a bit bigger! He looks a little small haha
So gun is gonna run this into the ground like they did with TCM yea? (Sarcastic btw im excited about this)
Oof that dr. Loomis voice over blows
I've fallen for this before. Not happening again.
I should be excited, but I’m not. Because I know this game will suffer the same fate as their other games. It’s a shame too, I genuinely enjoy Killer Klowns and thought it was really good.
Gun. 👎 Also, was that Dr. Loomis? If you want an impression, go for it. I'd love it. But that was nothing like him. You should have just gone with silence or a unique narrator perspective.
I want Corey Cunningham DLC
Please don’t ruin this game.
Halloween AND Hellraiser games coming out???? This is awesome!
I'm sorta hyped about this but when's Illfonic & Gun Media making an Elm Street game?
Omfg….
RIP headphone users
Nothing was shown here just a cartoon version of Halloween
The top of the mask, the forehead area looks like Resurrection Michael. I don't like that.
Gun media in one horror game = game dead in 2 yeras
Always wanted to play the previous games they have made but they were multi-player and I only play single player story driven games. Will get this just for the single player 👍
Hopefully you’re not just playing Michael it would be really scary to run from him lol
Sorry but HELLRAISER looks waaay better than this
He looks like the Mariah Carey memes idk
Need to make his head a little smaller
Another fuckin asymmetric stealth horror game that will be abandoned within a year
Oh so it is a game. No way he's coming back from that last movie Lol 🎃
Single player mode!!! AWESOME! hopefully it wont get that dead by daylight clone fate as evil dead or Friday the 13th.
Can I get it on ps4
If I dont get to play as micheal for the single player then fuck this game.
I hope it's not like Texas chainsaw massacre and dead by daylight. I hope it has a single player campaign where you can like pick your survivor and there's some kind of storyline
How many multi-player asymmetrical horror games that are only gonna last a few years do we really need?
This could be the best MP horror game since Friday the 13th the game (I’ve been praying for a Micheal Myers multiplayer horror game for years)
I’m really happy there’s going on I be a single player element.  Multiplayer is good but more horror games need single player for longevity
I’m hot im in heat for this game!
Ohhh yea can't wait. Hopefully we get another f13 game down the line
So ready for this game
GUN IS NOT DEVELOPING ONLY MARKETING AND PUBLISHING THIS IS A ILLFONIC GAME.
I remember when Friday the 13th came out. Played it first night. The roll out was brutal but the games I did manage to play... I really jumped a couple times. Thats with loud Jason Voorhees. I can't imagine what sort of jump scare crap im about to endure with this game. Defo a day 1 buy tho
Please tell me we can play as Dr. Loomis❤
Can we fast forward to release day now? 👀
The aesthetic of this game will be immaculate.
hell yeah!
😳😍💜🖤
He isn't a killer. He's a force of nature.
Some of these comments are making me scared for this game
We need a chucky game next with a 1 player campaign too
those animations will be one of the reasons it will fail . also devs from friday the 13th game....  a game that also  fell ... why oh why don't you just be ok with whatever BHVR pays you for the license of Myers in Dead by Daylight ...
change the mask and stuff and we good
How many assymetric games would it take before they realized people wants an actual single player/story mode of those franchise What how the "singleplayer" gonna be some short objective based "mini game" and not a fully fledge actual singleplayer story mode.
Coming soon RIP Halloween 😢.
Please fix the animations. It looked choppy and laggy and pretty bad. Also, why does Michael look like he has no neck? So many things wrong with this trailer already 🙄
Ew Gun? Screw gun LOL!
I Just went number 2
So.... You want us to spend more money on a game, just for you guys to shut it down? Tcm was a game you said you 'wouldn't give up on' only to immediately go back and say you were done with it. We all know that's exactly what's going to happen here..
That was one Temu Loomis.
I'd buy it for single player campaign without a secound thought.
Really hope they lean more into the horror aspect with this one. Survivors having to play from a 1st person perspective would be a great start
I cannot mesh what I’ve seen in these movies with how these type of games play
AAAHHHH WE NEEDED THIS!
Finally, I've been waiting for someone to make a Halloween Game that's just like Friday the 13th.
yikes made by gun
Gun media is the serial killer ... they killed Friday the 13th, they killed TCM and now the final nail on the coffin Halloween. It's sad to see that happening.
Brilliant 😆 .  My PlayStation 5 Pro with next years FSR4 ( full ) awaits 👌🏻 thos game 🎮 🎃
Michael gotta be 50 by now WHAT WILL TAKE HIM DOWNN
NOOO WAYYYYYY!!!!
Please let us be the killer.  I wanna go on killing rampage as Micheal Myers
I would love to see this for PS4 and the other consoles that are out
I can't wait for the "singleplayer" challenges that hardly have any story what so ever. Also can't wait for the service to go down which makes leveling up non existent and only playing as one Micheal myers skin, unless your online of course. I wish yall good luck but, i was a first buyer for the friday the 13th game and they always left fans hanging, bugs never getting fixed, laggy as hell single player challenges. Just don't f this up.
Perfect timing
That's  a really poor imitation of Donald pleasances voice...
👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀
"The day... HE CAME-"
This game won't last. Just look at Texas Chainsaw Massacre from the same studio.
About fking TIME!!!!!
What Gun and Illfonix drop this like a bad habit quickly. It's their MO. Look at Predator, Friday the 13the, Killer Clowns, and Texas Chainsaw
I am going to buy this
That's a terrible impression.
That looks awesome!!!
AI Kenobi talking.
He got no shoulders 😭😖😖
I want to be excited about this game but TCM was a mass. That game was awesome until they put out pay-to-win dlc with that busted Danny perk AND nerfed family at the same time. I was max level and dropped that game so fast. If this game has that trash and overpriced recolors, I don't want it.  Alternately, illfonic did a dang good job slapping together and releasing Killer Klowns with what an entirely different dev studio created. We got tons of levels (1000!) and loads of cosmetics. I hope the team at GUN listens and learns from them.  Also, I hope they keep Matt off public relations because he is not it anymore. He's antagonistic and probably burnt out after dealing with so much griefing since Friday. I can't even blame him. lol  Ultimately this is the dream team though! Friday was the best asym horror ever.  As always, I hope they find a way to keep the lobbies larger than a 1v4 and have coms between victims. Friday was THE party game for large groups to have fun playing together.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
No gameplay? Booooooo.
God, the voice over sounds horrible AF...
Yesss!
Hopefully its not like Texas Chainsaw Massacre that gameplay sucked
Please tell me it's not VR!! 🙏🏼
No offence but I could do a better Donald Pleasance voice but looks good.
2026??
I swear to god if this is just “DBD again” like every single one of these old horror IP games I’m gonna fucking lose it
Thank God I always want to play a Halloween game
After the disaster of TCM the game, evil dead the game only suriving 1 yr, and the f13 lawsuit. Im probably good on this. Plus i feel the single player mode will just be little missions like they did in f13.
FINALLY
I didn't know that John wick was in the game 1:31
Thank God there's single player, not trying to face a flying Myers in this game too
Please dont suck like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre did.
Can't wait make it online play too
I’m sold!
I don't play video games, but this is badass! My son will like it! ❤
I’m bout to cry. My favorite horror icon finally gets a game😢
Gun again :(
OMG ANOTHER DEAD BY DAYLIGHT GAME WOOHOOO -.-
yummy cant wait to play. but it better not have a $70 price tag
LETS GOOOOO
Another 1v4 game
The girl's running animation is goofy, in a bad way. Why not treat this franchise as seriously as it's supposed to be? Took me right out of it. Michael looks weird as hell. He looks too small and his dome is absolutely massive. Not a great first impression
Thank God they're making a game about Michael Myers 🤗🤗
🎉😢 it's so beautiful. Finally
It’s fake yall the show says they’ll be gone *edit I was wrong it’s real*
Oh no the animations look goofy...
That voice acting
These animations are absolutely horrible
YEAH BABY THATS WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT. this is very exciting
I’ll wait till I see gameplay
Seems very chill and relaxing
Thank Glory to God they FINALLY gave my boy Michael his own video game, can't wait to get this.
IT'S ABOUT TIME WE GET A FREAKING SINGLE PLAYER GAME. ALMOST EVERY GAME IS ONLINE ONLY.
If we can get voice chat and a multiplayer mode this will be a fun game
Im fired up
Gonna be fire
Yooooo! I was asking for a Halloween game way before Friday the 13th! I've been more of a Michael Myers fan then Jason!
Yeah…AI was used to generate parts of this.   Pass.
Very interested but my GOD what an awful voice-over. Sounds like a 17 year-old trying to sound 70.
This will fail, gun media and illfonic? Dead game
Maybe stand alone horror classics won't do as well, because new generation vs old consumers. Though a game that incorporates at least a few horror classics might. Jason, Freddy, Michael and Jeepers Creepers. They don't even have to intertwine the stories, just be a character or characters that choose a fate and encounter 1 of the 4. There could be 4 long levels per story and if it's good, make a part 2 to the game. Almost like 4 movies per game. That will help the horror characters live on and possibly encourage more real movies. So many games you can make like that with favorite horror movie characters, because you as the player can be a simple character that intervened in the villian's story. Survivor or victom.
I need to see gameplay!😮😮😮
Nobody get their hopes up. This game will flop within the first year
Definitely getting this one
I thought it was fake on TikTok. Guess I was wrong can’t wait to play as Michael yous are all fked when I’m on muwhahahahaha.
maybe this is wrong but....when the theme song hits when Michael walks up, is hype for me.
Gun. Huh. They want to create and abandon games in every horror franchise? XD
Brought to you by the developers of other asym games like:  Killer Klowns (dead game) Texas Chainsaw Massacre (dead game) Friday the 13th (dead game)  Evolve (dead game)  Don't worry, guys. I'm sure this time will be different
Besides the original movie and the 2018 sequels, I truly enjoyed rob zombie’s 2007 version, hopefully there’s a way to implement that version somehow in here, maybe a costume for DLC? Or a mask you can unlock ?
As long as its better than Haloween Ends, which shouldn't be that hard, ill be happy.
I hope multi is similar to what we got with Friday the 13th. When that game worked, and the lobby was full, it was a really fun experience.
Fantastic trailer. 👍👍
Please don't be a dead by daylight clone, Please don't be a dead by daylight clone , Please don't be a dead by daylight clone
I would love a horror game where you control the villain.
Can’t wait to play it on ps5!
Why 2026 gta 6 will be out lol
So will this be yet another "TCM", "K***Klowns from Outer Space"or "Friday the 13th" asymmetrical game that will die after a few months?
Lost me at Gun being involved with this game
Man, I'd want to play as Michael
Stop coping, this game will be dead on arrival and end like all their other bad games.
its gun media so don’t get your hopes up
Thank God it's a game I thought it was another movie being made 😂 Please be good
So excited for this! I really hope the devs have learned what not to do from the sadly failed other asym games. High hopes 🤞
That’s a terrible Donald Pleasence impression! 😂
I wonder will other legacy characters be in video game from the series.
Hellraiser and now Halloween? Can we get Freddy game?! Would be so cool!
As long as it has a huge area of Haddonfield to explore and the signature theme music is there and the physics are cool, should be a great game. Dont mess this up
What's the point?
Whys mike waddling out like hes got a butt plug in? Oh boy here we go again with Gun
they neeed to work on the charcters nd micheal him self , even the body itself
That's a terrible casting for the voiceover, hopefully Loomis won't be in the game much.
Yaaaaaaassss 🎃🎃🎃
How long do you think it will take for the Drags to come from DBD and complain about the balance? Start the clock
Just hope they don't promise great content then lose the license like Friday the 13th
Im tryna play as Michael Myers tho
2026 WILL BE SO PEAK 🥹✌
If this could be open world where Michael is able to kill unsuspecting trick-or-treaters, I’d be in heaven! This is a game horror fans have wanted for decades
Dead by daylight 2.0
I really hope it’s good
Laurie, Annie, Linda, let's play hide and seek      ll...
Do we get to play as Mike?
friday the 13th game NO :: halloween YES
I hope this brings back the horror scary thrill that DBD has left behind but use to have when it first came out
LETS GOOOOOO 🔥
Not going to lie I was fully expected it to be online multiplayer...So nicely surprised
Gun and illfonic? Yeah, nah thanks, i already know how this story ends.
Stupid commentary
This legit got the biggest smile from me. Got a Halloween game trailer before GTA 6 and I’m not mad it lets gooo
Bout damn time 😂
🔪🎃🙌🏽
I don’t know how to feel about this. I’m a massive fan of the Halloween franchise (more so the first 2 movies….the others are a mixed bag).   I just don’t know if this is a IP that has much longevity in a video game platform unless it’s a single player where you’re trying to escape and evade Michael like Resident Evil has with Mr. X and Nemesis. But those games have other monsters to keep things dynamic.   I’m not sure Halloween has much to offer in terms of variety for a long term gaming experience. So while I am excited to see the Halloween IP continue to be utilized, and I do admire how well they captured the aesthetics in this trailer, I’m a little concerned for the success of this title.   Hellraiser on the other hand makes more sense which is why I’m looking forward to the game that was recently announced with a trailer for that.
Im intrigued to see how they make a game from this. Havent played any of their previous titles
I am so happy
LET'S GO!! "Emotionless face and the blackest eyes... the devil's eyes" I can't wait for it!
Can't wait 🎃
I cant wait
We got a Halloween version of the Friday the 13th video game before GTA 6
“MICHAEL!!!!!!!”
Game is gonna die in year and give it the bad treatment like tcm rip tcm
Esto me suena a otro evil dead the game o otro masacre de Texas 😢 ojalá me equivoqué
LFG!
Finalmente!
Cant. Wait.
Malek Akkad is he the descendant of the great mustapha akkad? Im already all in
TCSM F13th KKFO ED All failed before they could even launch, hood this one doesn’t
what a bad trailer...
Think I'm gonna pass on that one!!
LFG!!!!! I canot f'in wait!!
That voiceover is annoying and why is Michael's head so big?
"Gun." Aight, I'ma head out.
THAT SCORE!!!!
Looks like he escaped the entity from dbd.
I’m honestly surprised this took so long ngl
head looks too big tbh
GUN is a trash company DO NOT BUY THIS GAME YOU ARE BEING WARNED LOOK AT TCM
It’s about time they made a game for my bro Michael myers
A Michael Myers video game is super fucking awesome! Michael Myers is one of my best favorite Horror slasher Supervillains! YOUNG MULA BABY😎😎😎💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥👍👍👍
What a pointless game.
We're definitely not getting that blighted Myers skin in dbd now.
Please just be Friday the 13th reskinned. That game was amazing.
Gun media is making it... After the huge flops they've been dropping I definitely staying away from it
If they mess this game up too istg 😭😂
Fking ign the place nobody goes to for gaming info , also wtf was that narrator about fking weird  😂😂😂
Yo let’s go
HELL YESSSSSSSS🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I would have to buy it
Thank you jeebus for creating a "single player"
Now wtf the concept gone just radomly killing people like GTA😅😅
I heard Michael Myers goes by they/them in this one
Hopefully this is just a Halloween reskin of the Friday the 13th game that just forceably removed by the people who owned the Friday the 13th IP. I miss that game
I mean where's the game play this is gonna be like Texas chainsaw
Why does the voice over sound like Ed Wood?
FAKE AZ HELL
Are we bringing back the random games like the early 2000’s?
Uh oh. Gun has their hands on this? 🤢
We got Halloween the multiplayer video  game before gta 6
YAS! Gun is doing it!
I am so hyped for this game — it looks like it will have both single-player and multiplayer modes. Does anyone know if it’s going to support crossplay (between consoles and PC)? Because Friday the 13th didn’t have that, and I think it would make a big difference for this game
But hes not the boogeyman
I need this now!!
My oldest son would have loved this game. Michael Myers was his favorite. It breaks my heart thinking about him. I miss him dearly. Maybe I'll get it and add it to his things packed away. 😢😢💔😭😭
shit dr loomis impression with shit animation & movement, cant believe they released this as a trailer lol
At first I thought it was another Dead By Daylight chapter lol
Can't wait for pallet stuns lol
After Hellraiser are we getting another single player horror game? Amazing!  Edit: just done some more reading and it's yet another dead by daylight clone. No thanks
Toxic Commando, Halloween, now we just need a good Thing game and we'll have a John Carpenter trifecta
I hope this will be an improved version of Friday the 13th
I see Gun is still up to their old tricks again
STAY TUNED!
This could be really good if they don't mess it up. The same makers of Friday the 13th and The Texas Chainsaw game which were fun at the time but both games died. I wonder how long this game will last? I would possibly give it a try.
Friday the 13th was better than this, that’s just my opinion
Donald Pleasence sounds like he has a upper respiratory infection
I need a multi player
How is this game going to be played I wonder? I’m excited and confused at the same time. 🤦🏾‍♂️😂
🔥 Backyard sheds house basements and attics to expand locations 2  different streets   all we need is a new Saw 1 Game
Always wanted a single player Halloween game either you a survivor or as Michael Myers since I was a kid. Don’t mess it up!
These graphics already pmo. Don’t play with Michael Myers’ legacy!
Hell yeah 🔪🔥💯😈🤘
Is it supposed to be like a cartoon?
I'm cuming!
LETSS GOOOOO🔥🔥🔥🔥
It seems that everyone forgets about the scam that Gun did with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. 😶
Rule 34 artist : Can't wait for the Jamie Lee Curtis dlc
Everyone is so negative in the comment section… jeez, I personally enjoyed playing Friday the 13th online! Looking forward to this game when it drops!  🍂 🔪 🎃 🔥 💀
Count me in!!
is it going to be like jason and the texas chain saw? i want like an open world/ plat former.
Is this for consoles?
Whilst id love to get hyped for this, it will be another Illfonic game that gets put down after 3 months.
People in the comments crying about DBD 😂   Yeah, cry about DBD but yet it’s still a thriving game, but you’re drooling over this game that’s being made by the same company that made TCM and we all know how that game turned out. I don’t know why people get excited for Games like this anymore, it’s popular when it first comes out and in 2-3 months nobody plays it anymore. Same thing is going to happen with this game. I like Halloween too, but let’s be real here.
This game is gonna flop like TCM did. Even with the single part. Nothing is gonna beat DBD. It has to many content creators for their game.
Can I be Michal though and go on a rampage?!?;
Let’s gooooooo although I bought both Texas chain saw and killer klowns and barely played either. Friday the 13th was the king this is more in that vein
I loved it so much but why did you use AI to make this even the voice acting
I have wanted this since they shut down the Friday 13th servers
Single player will not be a story mode methinks which is a shame.
What about the Meta Quest..we need games also
They gotta fix that mask and the walk and stuff. I know eventually everyone mask and costume will be available but that one looks terrible
I thank,this game will be huge
Yeah, they will hype this up and release it, and they'll let it die just like all the rest of them.
Stop making 20 different games with 20 different villains. Just make a slasher horror game like Friday the 13th but instead of picking your version of Jason you pick your villian! Let’s say you choose Jason the map should only ones in his movies or if you pick Freddy, you get dream maps! Let’s say you pick pennywise you can do the streets of Darry or in the sewers! This would be 100x  better imo!!! You can bring in ALL the biggest and badest iconic killers like the 3 I named or chucky, Micheal, hellraiser, ghost face, leather face etc. almost like DBD but better bc that game is ass and all you do is fix generators.
Is this just going to be another one of those games, but like Halloween???
not even excited cause i guarantee yall just gonna bitch and complain about it and kill this game just like you did with TCM
i'm pretty sure that's not a gun at the end for everyone saying it is, maybe i'm just blind cue KoRn
I've been screaming for a Freddy Nightmare on Elm street game done the same way Until Dawn / Quarry is done . Single player , played based decisions. Please make it happen
Are you guys seriously going to trust Gun again? After what they did to Friday the 13th and TCM? They showed over and over how much they don't care about their player base, and you're still giving them money? Are you guys really that dumb? Wow, ok. Good luck!
Looks like crap smh
This is Fking Dope, Me and @BellaAMG just cant wait 🤩❤‍🔥
At 1:29 are you sure? "We call him baba yaga, The boogey man? He was the one who you sent to kill the f****ing boogey man! Ohh..."
Can’t wait for this game to come out so people can pretend to have fun for a month and then they abandon the game and we all go back to DBD because they focus entirely on making the game as immersive to the film as possible with no balancing whatsoever because they forget gamers are playing their games not real life scared teens but for some reason they don’t ever have a single player option and I know this trailer said single player but I could not be any less hyped after seeing who’s making it ESPECIALLY after seeing the new Hellraiser game’s trailer.
That trailer gave me chills
Bring campaigns back
That loomis voice needs work.
I need to actually see gameplay. It is to trust it
The one game i cant wait for!
Long over do! Finally michael myers is coming
This is from the same team that published friday the 13th and texas chainsaw massacre, both games sold at a premium and then were abandoned and servers shut down, DO NOT BUY this garbage, it will be dead within a year like everything they ever published.
Can someone please tell me if it is just like the other game? Or did they change everything and mess it up
Illfonic? Idk bout this.
Does anyone know what's an experience? Never heard about this form of media/entertainment.
Cannot wait for the Single Player to be just the multiplayer with bots. Theres no way they have the funding for a good single player if this is the trailer they make (skinny shoulders, wide head myers, terrible voice overs)
The narration voice acting is horrible.
That running animation though ...
"You cant kill the Boogeyman."  Then Halloween Ends was made. 😂😂
Gun Media hummmmm....... BAD
I used to pray for times like this
Looks like a trailer for a game made in 2015
oh Illfonic.... How I've missed you
This is the game that will get me to buy a PS5. I will buy this for sure.   That said, a few hopeful corrections:   The mask looks good, but is out of proportion to the body.   The girl looks… well, like she should be in a different game. A much older game.   I hope the graphics on this game are up to par. I haven’t owned a console since the PS1.   But I’ve got my fingers crossed.
God, I could have done a better Loomis. I'd be surprised if this was Loomis' voice from Halloween Kills because this sounds like AI.
Illfonic game... will be dead in two months, just like friday the 13th and Predator Hunting Grounds
I don't know man I'm a Huge Halloween fan but i see this being pretty boring. Single player for Texas chainsaw would have been much scarier.
Another game for illfonic and gun media to support for a year and then run into the ground
I can’t believe DbD is adding Michael Myers
Honestly, i know making a story driven game with established slasher icons is really difficult but its hard for me to get excited for another asymmetrical game, just not a big fan, i got bored so fast with the Jason and TCM games after the initial excitement wore off
Why does Dr. Loomis sound like Cary Grant though?
Storyline needs to be on point !!
I've been waiting years for a game like this
Wooooo🎉🎉🎉
Horrible animations there
The man who is responsible for the whole Halloween movies is a part of this game as well?!  Bro, this shit is about to be LIT AS FUCK!!! 🔥  Edit: I'm seeing comments about how Gun and Illfonic dropped the ball HARD on a few of their games, so now I'm worried.
I give it a year before Gun and Illfonic kill the game by shutting servers down like they did on Friday the 13th: The Game, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre game, and the Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game.
I could cry rn dude!  I freaking love Halloween 😭❤️❤️🎃
HYPE!!!!!
Finally they made a horror game with a single player. One was added to Friday the 13th years ago. But the game should've released with that mode. Most people want to play as the horror character. Which I hope is the case with the single player here.
This why gun abandoned Texas Chainsaw already?
I learned my lesson after Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw massacre: never gonna buy such a game anymore
Ima be just as scared as I was playing Jason 😂😂 but I can’t waittt
New horror game announcement  Look inside  Gun media
We will definitely be playing this
I absolutely can't wait!  I have wanted a Halloween game forever!  This looks epic.  I think most of the Halloween fans will be into this!
MICHAEL AUDREY MYERS BORN OCTOBER 19 1957🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃
FINNALY THE WAIT HAS BEEN HELL....  NOW TAKE MY GOD DAMN MONEY!!!!!
DUUUUDE WHAAAAATT!??!??
MAKE GAMING GREAT AGAIN
Hopefully we get a Laurie skin with the current yuge JLC rack
I hope a nightmare on elm street is next
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮  can't wait
I was excited until the Gun Logo came up 😞Won't buy it on launch day, maybe if it can survive over a year.
All I'm saying is if this game functions like Friday the 13th, being online play only I mean, then imma be pissed. If uts single player then im content
After what they have done to TCM, I see Gun Media, I don't buy. They can only fool me once. Good bye. Have fun.
soo hyped
Even if this game is ass, this trailer gave me chills. Love Halloween , praying it’s a great game.
GUN media singlehandedly ruining horror IPS since 2017. All we can do is hope for a little bit of longevity, single player or not this game should have no problem lasting 4-5 years. Curious to see what they actually let GUN do after flopping 2 major horror IPS.
What is that Loomis voice?!
That loomis voice is horrible
Illfonic and Gun? No thanks. Can't wait for this to be shutdown after a year
YESSSSS
nearly nonexistent hair physics on michael made me fucking wheeze lmao
I hope this is a great game! Michael Myers is so iconic and so is the Halloween movie franchise. It deserves an epic game for the fans. Now maybe a good Nightmare On Elm Street game with Freddy.
Improve that week, Dr. Loomis voice actor performance.
Can't wait for these idiots to fuck it up with only one major update a year again
I’m excited it’s almost spooky 👻 season
What is with the stupid voice over it's so jarring
its a play 2 game ??? what is this animations ???
Noooo way
The walking and running is off. AI? Looking forward to this tho for sure.
This will be a good game. It better be with this Ai.
YES!!! It's about FUCKING TIME! I've always wanted a game based on my top, top, TOP FAVORITE horror movie! This better have more maps and a way better playing experience than Predator: Hunting Grounds, that game made me feel jipped b/c I played it solo and you only get to play the Tutorial and thats it! They better do better than that with this game!
IVE BEEN WAITING SINCE THE FRIDAY THE 13TH GAME
YES YES
Yeaaaaaaa lfg ive been waiting for a micheal myers game
this will be an amazing game that will be shut down in a years time because of the mismanagement from gun media.
Gun devs ruined F13 and TCM. Completely cashed out and ignored the player base and actively fought with fans online for giving any criticism. It’s crazy. Don’t buy into the hype. It’s going to be dead in the water just like how TCM is now.
People are making it sound like it was gun’s fault that the Friday the 13th game died.   The issue was a giant legal battle between ownership of the rights for F13. They couldn’t develop the game anymore because they didn’t know what they could do legally, so it had to be shut down. F13 was actually a pretty fun game, so.  It baffles me how people are talking that the game just “sucked.” As if they knew why it shut down.
what love about this. theyve done what sucide squad movie did. made 2 different verisons. as alot of people clearly done remember the multiplayer failure froma few years ago with the same name
Gun/Illfonic Halloween asym game...NO THANKS!!! (no more games by these scammers)
0:01 *RESTART GAME*
2026!?
I’ve always wanted Freddy Krueger game
Video game trailers that don't have any actual gameplay are fuckin stupid.
Who is Michael Myers? Michael is a human incarnation of pure evil. Waiting gameplay.
I wonder if they will let you play as Michael? I've been a huge fan for years...when I go see the new movies I'm in the Theater like "Killem Mike" 😂
Ngl the graphics look like cheeks to be a game in 2025
"CALIFORNIA GIR-" oops wrong game
Yes we are finally getting a proper Michael myers game
Will it be on the ps4
Whoever did the voice of Dr. Loomis didn’t sound scary at all unlike the other two. Original and Rob Zombie’s version. I hope this is a fun game.
Volume down.
This is how it needs to return on the Movie Screen. They Messed Up The Last Film 🎥
Gun is involved? Doth the tales of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Friday thine 13th not fall upon one’s conscience?
Oh yay... let's watch Illfonic and Gun media murder another one of their games in a months time
Very nice good work.
Wow. Thats probably one of the best VG trailers of all time. 🏆
UOOOOOOWWWW
Bro, I can’t wait to hear someone say in game “ I shot em six times, he didn’t die!”
When watching the trailer I saw the Gun logo I let out a strange evil laugh and my girl friend looked at me like wtf 😮!   Ain’t no way I’m buying from them again 😂
My question is, will it end up like Friday the 13th game. Loved that game and was discontinued
this needs to be like friday the 13th game
Finally they made a Michael Myers I can't wait to get it
Survival horror?
this nice and all but can we bring friday the 13th back ??
If there is multiple Myers skins and weapons/kills. I really hope this time you’ll be able to use them all WITHOUT being connected to the internet unlike Friday the 13th where your stuck with only part 3 and 5, and what ever weapon/kills you had equipped.  Thats not truly offline
Yet another movie multiplayer horror game that nobody asked for that will be dead on arrival
I have a feeling it's gonna be similar to the Friday the 13th game. Probably can roam around the neighborhood,running inside houses,backyards, and possibly (most likely) get to play as Michael Myers himself.
This looks clean I can’t wait
Oh sweet joy there'll be a single player experience. Hopefully open world where you can play as either a Haddonfield citizen or Michael and with mostly accessible interiors. It would be dope if they added locations from other movies in the game as fun Easter eggs. Add DLC for a Season Of The Witch Shamrock Factory Town map. Different films masks. So much potential, hope they don't squander it.
When my and bro played F13 I kept saying...."PLEASE let them do this for Halloween and FINALLY. I am so fucking hyped for this
Im so nervous and excited.
At first I was like "Damn not these dead by daylight kind of games again"  But when I saw  "A Singleplayer and Multiplayer Horror Experience"  That's when I grab my Michael Myers mask and wait for this game to released ❤
Espero que este juego no se muera al año porque el maestro de pay to win DBD no lo opaque
Cant wait for busta rhymes character DLC
😮😮😮😮😮😮
The way she's running... Seems to me she got a severe case of hardcore doggystyle action just before.
He looks small. Like his mask is too big, his shoulders seem to be not broad enough, and he's got kind of a thin waist. I mean look, I'm not asking for a 7 foot tall, 300 lbs of muscle Myers, but something more then Teenager-Michael here.
Why is Myers so skinny looking? His appearance looks like someone cosplaying Myers. Mask to big, shoulders to small...
The graphics were vreat until the people showed up.
Wish it was more than 4 survivors. Friday the 13th was more fun with more survivors but I guess the NPC residents kinda make up for it.
Character animations reminds me of The Sims.
I just know that Mikey has Iridescent add-ons
Boogerman😂😂😂
Cool a game based off my favorite horror franchise! Too bad I don’t do well with horror games
So is this basically going to be a try and escape game like Texas chainsaw and Friday the 13th? I hope not I was a good RPG story or something.
I love how they have some Italian guy from the Bronx doing his best British accent
0:03 Gun
I'm so excited for this even though I know it will only last about two weeks and then they'll abandon the project and move on to something else like they always do. But hey, for those two weeks!
Everyone bashing on the game because gun media was mentioned, could you guys do a little research before typing a hate comment ect. Gun  media was only recently added to the project and has been stated they wont be as invlolved as eveyone thinks. Illfonic is the lead developer and they dont let their games die and care about the community. Stop trying to ruin a great game announcement just cause yall mad at gun. This isnt there game it is Illfonics game, gun is just helping a portion of it. Halloween will be here to stay and john Carpenter is even in on the game and so is Malek Akkad the original producer of Halloween. Both have way to much respect for Halloween to put their names on a game just for it to die. Again everyone hating because gun got mentioned needs to really do some research first. So hyped for Halloween!
What the actual eff is that voice acting? Is that a joke?
YES IM HYPED!
Why does gun always get this shit, the games done for
See we need something like this with Freddy.  Be on Elm Street right, as some sort of Freddy spirit, floating above homes looking for teenagera dreams to invade and one by one you kill each teenager until you get to(wait for it)..........Nancys house, with a ending like New Nightmare.  BAM!  Cold game!
Looks like DBD will be loosing the license… however / maybe now Myers will actually be able viable.
Michael Mayers.. background score ..uff.. 🔥
One shot myers gets his own game
Don't let it be like Friday the 13th the game
No AI was harmed in the making of this trailer.
For people who don't know about Guns reputation: they ruin every game they touch. Do. Not. Support. Them. They keep takin beloved horror IP's and then milk the money out of them then throw the games and their player base away. Don't trust gun!
Could've just fixed and updated Friday the 13th... the lawsuit ruined the game what says tgis will be sny diffrent and not get shut down by lawsuits?
Maneeeeeeeeeeeeeee My Dawggg Michael Myers😂😂😂😂😂
Gun sucks
Can’t wait to break it down to California Girls while Jamie Lee Curtis puts Michael in a shredder
Yes you can you just send John Wick “He’s the one you send when you want to kill the fucking bogey man”
I must go and watch Halloween now 😂
I'm honestly as hyped as I'm scared, since we all know how Gun managed Texas Chainsaw Massacre. If I buy a game I don't want to play it for 2 years before it dies.
Don't give me hope  I.m Halloween fan watch AMC Fun Fest   But darn it  Poor Jason   FT13 game got shafted   Texas chainsaw fans being abandon    Predator not getting real updates even they had a show and another movie or series coming out   As a indie game developer   I don't understand why illfonic is with gun  Gun gosh illfonic still dealing with them
I will buy this because it has offline matches with bots and singleplayer 👍
When I see ILLFONIC and Gun media, I know I'm being scammed. After 1 year, no more content.
Nice 👍
October 2026 I’ll be 33 by the time this new Halloween game comes out always had the chills watching Halloween movies as a kid used to watch them with my dad every year in October
Gun will ruin this mark my words
This looks terrible
Don't trust this game. They will never finish it. First Friday the 13th, then Texas Chainsaw, now this.
This would have been perfect for a October release, what a misss
I don't know about everyone else but I'm just praying John Carpenter composes a new score for this game...
Get in ur car and drive dafuq outta town!!!
The walk animation needs FIXED
His walk looks too normal. He moves like a regular person in a costume. Part of The Shape's unnerving presence is how not-quite-normal his movements were.
REF DO SOMETHING!!🥀 I am so SICK of this GENRE
DON'T GET HYPED.  It's just another asymmetric multiplayer horror game EXACTLY like Friday the 13th and all the rest - despite it mentioning single player (It's just the same game vs bots)
Why she run like that 😂
Shoulda have released it on Halloween 2025.....FAIL!
why he walking with a limb lol
its micheal look like old school micheal !!!
This looks ass
LETS GOOOO!!! I got the chills😂 I don’t care what anyone says I’ll always prefer a good asymmetrical game with friends than a single player game, glad to see we’re getting both with this one.
oh my god i complete halloween kills right now and i am going to watch halloween ends and im pretty shock right now halloween new game????
I wanna be able to get drunk at a bar before  he massacre us
Hopes its gonna be litt
Illfonic + Gun = you Know how it is
This would be pretty exciting if it wasn’t being made by 1 dev team that only has a track record for making games that die within a single month and a 2nd dev team who have a horrid track record of actively antagonizing their own players and abandoning every game they make…
Why his head look so chonky
The characters animation looks like the sims....and that's a trailer....
man i love halloween i want a game but not god damn dbd that’s basically what it’s gonna be right? it would be so cool to have a halloween game with a traditional story mode, you get to play during 78, 2018, kills and ends as the story goes in the movie but you can also play like an arcade mode.
This game is gonna end up as abandonware, isn't it lmao
Hopefully this washes that sour taste Ends left with Michael's last appearance
This game better have a multiplayer like Friday online.
He was taller and had broader shoulders in the movie last I remember
This is Halloween. The only other horror movie to stand close statistically in popularity next to 'Jaws,' 'The Exorcist' and 'The Shining.' This is a titan IP compared to F13, or TCM which are both super huge IPs. If they ruin this game, it will damage their status beyond repair. Adding a single player experience is very bold and a very awesome direction. Making this a multidirectional experience is giving me hope that it won't turn into another DBD follower. And it looks like legally everything is done right this time. So we can only hope they honor Daddy Mike with the devil's eyes properly! Let's get it spooky club!!
About time!!! I’ve dreamed of this lol
a new DBD-like that’ll die a few months after release…. yayyy….
About time plus single mode hope it’s a story mode
GTA might have some competition???? Maybe I'm excited about it tho
I am getting so annoyed with the incessant CGI. Holy fuck it feels like we are going backwards. Reminds me of the cgi from the clone wars days.
gun entertainment involved? RIP
Could've gotten a better Loomis voice. Michael Looks like Ben Tramer a bit.
Damn, video game models still look like shitty puppets when they run
Make Michael Myers Great Again!
Gun is gonna ruin this like every other game they touch. Abandoned TCSM for no reason.
Is it just me or do the proportions on Myers look off?  Notably the head looks comically large and upper body looks shorter than it needs to be.
💦  DbD hornies eating good
Single player <3  Thank you!
Finally!
Single player YESSSSSSSSSSS!!!! Every horror franchise game is RUINED by the horrible 1 vs group dynamic. Thank you!!🙏
dbd killer for sure 🤣
Illfonic y gun , jajajajjjaaaaaa, NO GRACIAS. 😂
Thanks you yesss so long we got it Halloween Game is here for horror community
I'll be about this is the single player is good. I'm over every franchise being a DbD knockoff. I want story. Hellraiser looks phenomenal
Im gonna play that🎉❤
DBD fans here from the home feed:
For everyone saying "Oh gun is going to mess this up" ILLFONIC is developing the game and guns involvement is only as the publisher. WE ARE GOING TO BE FINE! BE HYPED!!!
Now i can die in peace ❤️‍🩹
Lets gooo!!!!
Is that all you people do is complain?!
why does it look like a ps2 game, and not in a good way?
Please be like friday the 13th game
Hellrasier/ Halloween
That narration voice impersonating loopis was terrible
First hellraiser now Michael myers
Why not just play dbd? I feel like just one killer with one play style would be borrrring
The single player is probably gonna be the best thing for a game like this !! Having a great horror story line ! The others like TCM are really not great because they don’t have a campaign.
To anyone who thinks gun media is making this game you are wrong. Gun media is the co publisher of the game. Its illfonics game meaning illfonic is in charge of the game. Gun media they are just helping with marketing. Thats it.
Psst, hey Lonnie! Get your ass away from there!
Am I trippin or is Michael's legs super long? And do the walking/running animations look weird? Like over done or over exaggerated?
YESSSS!
Wow I am So Excited I always Wished For🔥🔥🔥
Gun media? I'd rather be last in the Bonnie Blue queue
Guys, remember this is the same people who made the texas chainsaw game. . . You know, the people who just suddenly gave up on it even though there was SO MUCH MORE to add.  This isn't me sayig to not buy the game, not at all, i might even buy it. I'm just not getting my hopes high and expect it to be dropped in 2 years, just like texas.
YEEEESSSSSSS!!!! I've been saying for years that Illfonic should do this game! Finally! 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽😍😍😍
Yeah wish it came out a couple years ago back when me and my brother would still play online together like that, we use to play Friday the 13th an had a lot of good moments, hope this game gives the same vibes
Cooool 😁🫶❤️
Really hope thats not the final outcome
Dead by daylight is gonna lose a lot more licences in the future. Also remember that you're not owning killers anymore. You're only unlocking them
I call it was gonna be online but singleplayer hows that gonna work i hope singleplayer isnt talking about playing with 4 bots and played as the killer that will not be fun at all
Better not be no dead by daylight copy I'm saying this and dbd is one of my favorite games
That "Single Player" is what sold this game for me. lol We have enought slasher franchises trying to become the next _Dead by Daylight._ Don't get me wrong, I enjoy that game, but every single horror franchise trying to capitalize on that (and failing) was starting to become annoying. Especially since most of these games ended of dead. But _this..._ Oh, I'm loving me some single-player content with Michael terrorizing me! 😁
Yall needa widen his shoulders a lil, makes his head look big as hell🤣😭
Ah can't wait for this game to last 2 years and for Gun to abandon it for another new IP
The real question is what dose he do on his off days. Go for walks bake cookies. And pay those bills.
This is a day 1 buy for me!!!! My favorite horror person!! Michael Myers!! Looking forward to it
With how insane the graphical capabilities have become I am surprised that they haven't turned more classic horror movies into games. Like 🎃🎃Halloween🎃🎃, Friday the 13th, and others. A Nightmare on Elm Street could be a really twisted graphical experience, especially when you'd be inside the "Dream World" or "Dream Sequences". There would be no limits to that. However a 🎃🎃Halloween🎃Game🎃🎃 would be a great start to a New type of Horror Game Genre.
And I just finished watching the original Halloween movie this is perfect and I will get it when it comes out and I might change my profile pic to Micheal instead of Niko oneshot
No thanks. Can't play Friday the 13 anymore so I'm not interested.
Seems its Gun interactive making this game I give this game 2 years and Gun will stop all support like they did with TCM.  Get ready for lobbies full of bots   Gun interactive is a massive let down
Gun? Tcm? rip
Gun ???
1:35 he is not boggey man
I’m excited for this game. I’ve always wanted a definitive Halloween game, and I have high hopes for this one. F13 was beautiful in its prime, and when it got shut down, I was definitely bummed out. I’m glad to see Illfonic and Gun Media get back to the drawing board for another horror game.
Gun media sorry aint buying
This game will be die if bcuz gun media cant maintain it , same happend with f13 , tcm
This game will be die if bcuz gun media cant maintain it , same happend with f13 , tcm
Terrible Dr loomis impression
Because GUN is involved this game is DOA
Illfonic is ON 🔥.🎉
Single player oh yeah I'm buying 👌
They have access to all of these horror IPs, and they waste them on asymmetrical multiplayer games.
Well they created that boogie man by how they treated him now deal with it lol
I genuinely hope the gameplay is not slow and clunky like tcm was. That game felt like absolute dog shit to play. Based off this trailer the characters look like tcm characters that’s not a good start. This company is actively shitting on numerous horror franchises. Who gave them the green light to do this?
The animations were not good. Looked like a kids show computer generated in the mid 2000's like Jimmy neutron.
That was the boggieman  As a matter of fact that was
Nope,  alien isolation., I still love the music lol 😆 😂 😌
Thank the lord
Michael will be as weak as in dbd
So Jason Voorhees gets a game, now Michael Myers gets a game. Who's next, Freddy Krueger? (Please let it be Freddy Krueger)
I'll give it a year or less than that before they abandon it
Please tell me we are getting a slasher game where the slasher is supposed to win. Every one of these games just becomes a cake walk for the survivors a week in when they figure out what the meta is.
We lost the online for Friday the 13th. But I’m pumped for this one!
The narrator was trying to be Donald Pleasence(Dr Loomis) and it sounded awful
At last a Halloween game which can be played in single player  Just hope it's also offline too lol as some stupid single player games I have seen are online only even tho it can be played in single player like tom Clancy's breakout
Even though it’s single player, it’s still made by Gun. Don’t trust them anymore.
This game will also die like the previous ones from gun 😂
That Loomis voice over is dreadful, terrible impression.
You can't stun him. You can't reason with him. You can't kill....the boogey man🗣️🔥🔥🔥
Omg cant wait super excited
Its multiplayer and single player
"As Michael Myers, give them a reason to fear the dark and cut the phone lines to prevent the police from ruining his favorite holiday" so basically AT&T simulator
I like MM but this is gonna flop just like the rest of them.
Ngl texas chainsaw game was pretty bad
Possibly story mode where you're actually experiencing the real thing and you choose your way of faith
Gun huh? Hardpass
lmao Illfonic? Thanks I’ll just stop the trailer there. Not worth the time.
I actually expected this game to be good. ILLFONIC  is over the game gun is just partnering so it should be good
I think we're getting a DBD knockoff
Jesus Christ, is Gun just going through every major horror franchise, turning it into an asymmetrical horror game and then abandon it? Loved their Texas Chainsaw Massacre one at first, until they got lazy and sloppy with maintaining the game. Not making the same mistake twice.
Guys 3rd gen just popped 2 more to go
Take my money take my money
I love the Halloween movies but this looks terrible unfortunately
Scam like Texas Chainsaw Massacre abandoned after 1 year
Hopefully these other Horror icons will get their own game as well  Ghostface, Art The Clown, Sam Trick R Treat, Freddy Krueger, Chucky, Candyman, Pumpkinhead, Pennywise and Beetlejuice
Narrator sounds like obi wan. Hello there
My real name is Jason.
❤❤❤🎉🎉🇰🇭🇰🇭🫶🫶
Cant wait for the 15 dollar gold michael  mask ✨️ and the 20 dollar diamond knife
mobile game vibes make this scary
Made by SCUM media no thanks. They had a chance after TCM when they screwed up F13 they still failed. They’ll just make the game pay to win like Danny in TCM to get players to but their overpriced DLC.
How does it take almost 50 yrs for a proper Halloween game? I just don't understand.
Now the movie makes sense after all these years… It’s all just a simulation inside a video game. Dumb AI NPCs. Respawning after death, teleporting, and a no-clip killer. Just kidding.
Absolute Cinema
Am I the only one who thinks Michael is very thin???
Excuse me,do you have a momment to speak about our god our lord the entitiy {dead by dayligh}
Why his head so big 😅
Gun's games are awesome and FILLED with love, it's their business models that suck though. So what use is there??
The blue print to a dope survival horror game is ALIEN ISOLATION
Why is she running like the aliens off Mars Attacks 😂😂
I hope they will not abandon it tribute for f13
Can’t wait to see that game die after half a year.
... we already have dbd though..
это артем придумал не благодарите
АМАИЗИНГ❤
I can't wait for this.. please don't mess this game up
Michael Myers looks stupid. Please make his proportions correct before release.
Oh wow another game for gun to abandon great
It's about time Halloween got It's own official game.
Gun Interactive is a new next BANGER   First..  Friday the 13th, then Texas Chain Saw Masacure .... and now Halloween.... next what? Nightmare on Elm Street? ... BRING IT!!!!
He's coming to get you Barbara!
This is the worst thing I've ever seen solely because Gun is on ANOTHER beloved IP. They can't keep getting away with this
Yessss!!!!!😱🔥❤️
That damn song will forever give me chills 😂😂.. creep me out as a kid
Multiplayer mode that will become peer-to-peer matchmaking, just like what Gun did with TCM.  The moment I saw Gun co-developing this, I got a sour taste in my mouth.   I don’t trust them after what they did to TCM, so I’ll wait at least five years after this game is released before I buy it. :D
I thought this was a new movie
Yeah no
We need a single player Nightmare on Elm Street game. Multiple chapters. Each chapter you play as a different final girl (or final boy).
My prayers has been answered I always wanted a Halloween Michael myers game 🙌
I wouldn't get too excited with Gun, there's a high chance it ends up like TCM, F13th and Killer Klowns
Remember F13? Texas Chainsaw? Because I do! Never again!
I was excited until I saw Gun Media was attached 🙄
👀cool
Take my money. Finally a Halloween game. Don't care if the game only lasts a couple of years, it's literally chump change for a slice of Myers fun.
The animation looks bad
Throw his bh ahh in a grinder..... The end
"Death has come to your little town, sheriff."
I got sad when the Friday the 13th game was shut down but I bet this one will be just as good.
*theme music plays* Me: Lesss goooo!!! 🔥 *Gun logo appears* Me: ...fuck
Michael Myers and Hannibal Lecter are my favorite serial killers, and knowing that a game is coming out soon where we could be Michael or his potential victims makes me very excited. I just hope the single player mode has a storyline.
This is gonna be epic! I was gutted when the Friday the 13th game went under! I loved it and played it constantly and I’m not even a game but just a massive horror fan.  Now horror got all that better for games.  EPIC
We need John Wick to kill the f**king Boogeyman.
I honestly am excited for this esp cuz gun is making it, i dont care that tcm isnt gonna get more updates its already really good and im fine with no future stuff and for F13 its not there fault for it shutting down.
Love the films but this trailer looked and sounded awful, was that voice supposed to be Dr Loomis? Sounded awful, and it just looked plain bad imo. I'll still be getting it though 😂
Please let us play Michael myers 🙏 😬
Mariah Carrey game before GTA
this is cool but, they should making micheal myers wider you know, to be imposing
I just feel like being Michael just killing....... in a video game of course 😂  When the Sims first came out I'd through parties and kill one person a party I'd host... only way to do it is build a fence around them and wait for them to pass. Backyard a cemetery until everyone in town was gone.   I'd prefer this than the slow Sims serial killings with built fences
Awesome that hellraiser and helloween are coming and have a single player story 😎👌👏 let's go 🔥
We finally got something. I am so glad to see that it will have both single player and multiplayer options. Will be looking forward to the single player first.
That animation was like a bad old Pixar film.
and here I thought DBD was bad... what the hell with running animation? scared npcs in Ghost Master had same animations but it was a parody game. why is his head so big when camera is angled upwards.. is it a horror parody?
interesting, is there a reason why all these old horror IPs decides to make games at this moment in time?
Singleplayer! ❤
Can't wait to walk away instead of running
Please don't die after 8 months like EVERY SINGLE asym horror game except DBD
😉👌😉👌😉👌😉👌
Alright another dead IP horror game gun and illfonic ? No thanks i learned from tcm to not buy their games cant wait to be insulted by gun game bugged and never fixed etc
Yeah well f13 had single player too. It was nothing to write home about
Hopefully not a first person game🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻
What's with the voice... Sounds like a teenager pretending to be an old man...
Holy shit another dead by daylight
Is it just me or does this trailer look trash there's something weird about it right?
I shall acquire this game
- FINAL GAMEPLAY FOOTAGE NOT REPRESENTED - but still pretty close  GUN 🚩 I think I'm gonna wait for Hellraiser instead
I think his head is way too big hope they adjust that
Micheal be killing a whole neighborhood every movie 😂
Love that it's also getting single player! Hope it's something full-fledged and bigger than Friday the 13th's though... But really excited to see Illfonic is now tackling Halloween. I spent around 300 hours on Friday the 13th the Game: after Jason I'm ready to spend some time with Michael!
I've been waiting for them to come out with a Halloween game like this.
Neeeed
About time a michael myers game thank you
Single player I buy 🪓🔥
So is this gonna be like dead by daylight? Gosh I hope not. Anyways, the only L here is its not coming out in like 2 months
Wish they would do this with Scream.  But man PLZ be on PS4 too  ! 🤞🏽
I miss Friday the 13th. That was the best game 😢
Only good were getting is a good Myers design as thats all Gun can give us with their horror games other than abandoning them. But yeah if we got Savini Jason and Nicotero Leather Face, lets hope we get a good Myers
Terrible animation.
Lol, could they not get someone who sounded like Donald Pleasence? That guy sounds  horrible.
Damn this looks soooooo goood!!
no larry king?
My prediction for this game, there will be EVERY mask/suit he’s ever had in the movies and each skin gives u different abilities, and depending on the different Michael skin changes his height based on the different Michael actors played in the movies.
The Halloween theme song will never get old, this is one od the most iconic songs of all time and it's so cool to see a new singleplayer and multiplayer Halloween game, but i'm sad it's not coming in october this Halloween!
Awesome, after this bring a movie just like the game . 🙏🙏🙏🙏
not look good
Just remember GUN MEDIA only releases a year worth of content they make all their money and abandons games after 2 years if you're lucky! Also it takes them 3-6 month to update any bugs in the game! & yhey dont listen to their community
YES
Imagine guys a resident evil style halloween game
ITS TIME...MICHAEL!
GUN MEDIA BACK ON IT
I feel like he looks a lot more smaller. He’s a tall well built character but the way they made him look was just like a stick
Yeah that looks pretty cheesy
Scratched mirror Myers players are licking their lips rn😂
Halloween is my favourite series,as messy as it is, this is awesome! If its half as good as their friday game this will be great
Hell yeah 🎉😮😅
Predator hunting grounds, killer klowns from outer space, TCSM. This game is gonna bomb.
I know 1978 Myers was 5’10 , but imo this game should have a bigger Myers just for intimidation
Is this coming to playstation and xbox?
Instant eyeroll as soon as i saw Gun🙄
Hey Gun, can you let me know when you decide to abandon this game just so I dont waste money on it?😊 rip TCM
That’s a dreadful bit of voice work. Truly awful.
This will be crap, hopefully Hellraiser won't be.
I always wished for a michael myers game like this😭 im so exited for this
No! This studio abandoned Texas Chainsaw Massacre game and doesn’t respect their customers 👎
EVIL DIES TONIGHT😂😂😂
The most scariest  Mf out there period my Jason and Freddy are school girls compared to Big Mike .... I know his boogie man ass is slow AF I'ma pick the fastest runner with high stealth and run my ass from my haddonfield IL .,.TO Chicago where it's safer!!! Let Old man Loomas ... Bracket,..  Ben Tramer and Tommy Doyle and the drunk mob from Halloween Kills deal with his ass cause EVIL DIES TONIGHT 😂😂😂
So much disappointment is coming... I'll be there to say i told you so
We’re going to get Illfoniced in the Gun again, aren’t we?
Will we get to play as Michael Myers and Hamie Lee Curtis? Or will it be a multiplayer game like Friday the 13th?
Single player, must mean there's a good story mode on this one
Bro is still alive
I spent 8 years trying to reach him, then another 7 to keep him locked up because what i realized what was living behind that boys eyes was pure and simply evil 😈
Wheres the Freddy one? Imagine playing as a dream warrior
Sees Halloween game 😀 sees Gun media as one of the publishers ☹️
Yasss I'll beat Michael's ass from a distance lol 😂😂😂
Michael looks a bit odd the mask is a bit weird looking and Michael looks extremely tall and skinny
hopefullly it is a cross over to serious sam
Michael Myers is back j’ai trop hâte
Oh look Gun got another horror IP to milk for a few bucks then abandon.
Illfonic and Gun?  I already know the game is gonna feel and look unfinished like Killer Klowns and after a year or two they will stop supporting it ...
I hope it’s not like until dawn..when it’s just 85% cut scene
I hope they keep the servers open unlike they did with friday i loved that game
We need a new Halloween movie that is literally based around Halloween. Keep it simple
It looks horrible and sounds horrible. ffs
Michael myers and jason game so hyped
Yall better not fuck this up im still mad I never got that Jason X update and never got to play that map
Friday the 13th 2???
Gun and Illfonic...... we are doomed
Watched this trailer 31 times now.. the music hits ya. Nothing beats it
Michael Myers must be the quietest roommate ever… until you realize he’s practicing knife skills in the kitchen.
Ok what the hell is the actual game? I hate trailers like this that literally reveal zero about the game.
Boycott gun
Those animations though... Top notch... Narration... Top notch...  Easily a GOTY, worthy of it's 89,99$ price tag or I'm not a worthy IGN reviewer candidate.
🗣️DAY ONE🔥
This Legendary 🐐
YAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH YAHHHHHHHHHHHH HOLY FUCK YAHHHHHHHHHH   GOD I HOPE IT'S AS GOOD AS THE FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH GAME!!!!
Finally!
Single player will be nice as well considering i play Friday the 13th almost everyday 💀🤍🤍
I hope we get all of his costumes from all the movies to play as Michael Myers
Oh I thought it was a movie
Multilayer is  all I care for
i want to play as Michael
The voice over was a very poor imitation of Donald Pleasance
So when are the trilogy games coming😅
OMG!!!! FINALLY!! im super hyped for this!!!  Cant wait!!!!  Please do a good let it be great. TCM game was Horrible!!!
Oookayyy
Wtf is this voiceover 😂
I was getting excited until I realized its asymmetrical multiplayer.
Wonder how they'll pull this game off when Michael Myers doesn't run if they stay true to the movies
Halloween is my favorite horror movie, so I'm hoping this is just a trailer alone and not indicative of the final product.   The animation of the girl running was absolutely terrible. I seriously hope that improves.   The voice over was not well done either. Donald Pleasance had a very distinct voice. Find a better voice actor or as a last resort, use A(.   Now, having said that, it's good to see that other aspects of the Halloween film are intact and I hope those carry over to the final game. I look forward to playing.
Finally!!!!!!
We can all thank HellRaiser Revival for giving us single player Horror Games. 🤌 cause let's be real, if it wasn't for the new HellRaiser game this probably would be just like Dead by Daylight.
No way am i giving gun media another cent.
I’m about to cry. My favorite horror movie villain is finally getting his own real game with single player🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽‼️‼️‼️. Next is nightmare on elm street and Jeepers creepers pls we have the tech for it now‼️🙏🏽
Love the idea of a Halloween game with a story, the animation and voiceover looks pretty bad so I'm going to hold out until this is properly reviewed before throwing money at it. Nostalgic music and imagery isn't enough, if it's online only it'll be a hard sell.
Single player? I dont care if its 3 or 6 hours, I will be getting this!!
WTF in 2025, girl run's moves are like in psx...😂😭
At least they're giving us singleplayer so when the server shuts down we don't just load into the start menu..
Hmm i wonder what this game will be like in a couple years.. probably in the GRAVE
wtf.. is that Michael Myers model.. jesus !00% will not buy it like this..
This game will get shut down In 3-4 years time I bet
Looks like a Sims expansion pack
I must admit, the trailer had me tense.
I can't wait for the day to play this
Well, at least it has a single player mode. We’ll see. Though I’m somehow still certain that it’ll get hyped up, get a decent fanbase, and then be put down like a stray dog just like F13, TCM and Evil Dead before it.
Take notes DBD!
Trailer would have been better with zero narration.
If its another failed multiplayer,no thanks
Shame on you GUN.
Stupid
Take my money
We're so back!!!
Is Jamie Lee Curtis doing voice/mo-cap work in this?
After what they did to Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw Massacre im not guying another one of GUNs games again.
first Friday The 13th then Killer Klownz from Outer Space then Texas Chainsaw Massacre and now Halloween  now all we need is an A Nightmare on Elm Street game next.
Stop letting Gunn make horror movie games.
This gives so many vibes that the same thing will happen as Friday the 13th and TCM
Illfonic/gunn on a speed run to take some of the most iconic franchises and ruin them. Friday the 13th, texas Chainsaw Massacre and Killer klowns from outer space all failed, and this won't be any different no doubt
Hopefully its like tcm to where its on old gen and newgen but pls make it crossplay aswell
Ah ilfonic again?!
HALLOWEEN is The GOAT!
YAY another game Gun is going to make yall buy just to turn it off after the cash grab YAY 👎 ill wait for it to be free for psplus Made me waste my dam money on tcm and dlcs just for a good game with potential to die
Gun media?  No thank you . . .
Don't let Gun ruin another game like what they did to Texas chainsaw massacre
"single player" SIGN ME UP!!!
Another friday the 13th?
A HALLOWEEN GAME??? LES GOOOOOOOOOOOO
The narration was so horribly bad
The voice acting is terrible 😂
DBD is the King right now.
Dayyyum that iconic music is a chef kiss
These graphics look pee pee poo poo Wagwan wit dis?
Damn this game is going to have 3 really good months and then tank like the rest. Should be fun hopefully on game pass
YEEEEEESSSSSSSS!  I called it!!!  I've been saying for years that now that Gun Media has abandoned the Friday the 13th game because of legal issues, they should make a Halloween game with Michael Myers and they did it!  Can't wait!!!
Extra spooky.. my phone went black and white when the lights went out at the end.... added to the atmosphere.
... ... that animation was trash,... do better
Single player going to be just challenges like Friday the 13th
release date october 31st 2026
Damn, I always wondered why there is no game for Michael Myers, now we are here.
Yk it's going to suck when they have to use ai for the narrator
Bout time single player jeeez
For anyone who is thinking about picking this game up remember these type of games die or end support within 2 years or less. Save your money when dlc drops and just play the game. Gun and illfonic milk there players for lame skins that don't change gameplay. Plus when the severs die its all gone anyways. I won't buy a single dlc until I see it go past the 2 year mark and it's still going.
Im sold
I don't know why people keep saying "it's developed by Gun" It's IllFonic game, Gun came in late and joined in. I wouldn't expect them to even have close to 50% of the say so in this.
Single player mode can mean a lot of things. This is most likely a mp focused title
DO NOT SCREW THIS GAME UP!  I hope we see this October of 2026.. early October please.  If that song doesn't get you pumped.. you definitely don't feel it
Another horror game we all hope doesn’t flop
Hopefully this one don’t get discontinued like the last 2…
I had a feeling Halloween Ends wouldn't be the last time we saw Michael. After all, you can't kill was isn't even alive. Dr. Loomis spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up as a boy because what he saw behind the eyes of that blank, emotionless face of that inhuman monster was pure and simply, evil.
Helllll yeahhh!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well, i knew I would see GUN's logo at the end of this trailer. This should be interesting though.
watch bhvr laugh as this gets no more support 2 years later
Can't wait to unlock all micheal myer skins ...... gun always makes great horror games and pays attention to details from the movies . I can only imagine all the different maps they will have in the game
Can't wait to see them abandon this one after like a year too
I hope we can play as Michael Myers in both versions
Hopefully this takes what they did with Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw Massacare and perfects it
Sounds like "Gun" is the Michael Bay of video games 😂 when Bay messes up his movies badly.
Looks like kinda wonky animation.  Hopefully this isnt some friday the 13th/texas chainsaw game clone
For a 2025 game, this looks awful LOL!
Sick as hell
ILLFONIC AND GUN 😂 the game will be delisted in two years , there is no DLC worth waiting for , cheating will be prominent with hacks , the devs already said they can’t handle TCM why would we buy this   The story is just Ai segmented parts like Jason had 😂 don’t be fooled yall
Gun suck ass. They pretty much gave up on Texas Chainsaw Massacre
Ayeee
Wow - the Donald Pleasance voice over sounds like a 22 year old trying to pretend to be a 58 year old Pleasance.
Was there another second stream for gamescom or where ❤as this announced
PS5 ?
Terrible Loomis impression.
I feel like by “single player” they’re gonna mean “the killer plays by themselves 😊”
Oh my f goodness, I am so stoked and excited ☺️😮🎉❤
This is *EASILY* one of the best game trailers in YEARS... this is very close to Dead Island level, to not say same level.
For the love of God, can we please get a *Nightmare On Elm Street* video game involving Robert England while he is still alive. Give Robert his flowers and make the video game like the movie "Dream Warriors" from Part 3!  By the way, I'm so glad they're making this Halloween video game!
Please Gun, don't make the same mistake you did with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, release the game without bugs, well polished and a fun game to play, balanced, that has a lot of useful life and is part of our memories, praying that this game is good, Halloween is my favorite franchise and I always asked for a game like this!!!
Halloween nerd here 1st he was killed 2 the voice actor for Loomis sucks
Playing as a Killer vs survivor bots, and playing as a Survivor with teammates bots, offline modes. Is what will make this a great game.
FINALLY WE GET A GAME ❤❤❤❤❤
Finally! A horror video game that isn’t strictly multiplayer! Move over Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Killer Klowns From Outer space, Halloween is here
I can tell from the comments yall dont look around enough we also have hellraiser coming too so much unnecessary hate towards dbd chill out
Please don’t let it be another Friday the 13th
I laughed at the voice over😂 just use AI at this point
Very cool 😃
Yes we’re finally getting a Halloween game just hopefully they don’t Fk up like TCM did
how many months until they turn off the servers?
Dead by daylight is shitting their pants right now
I'm here for it
I hope there will be a collectors edition
I was saying that their needs to be Halloween game and it's finally gonna happen
get gun off off of this
Man I miss Friday the 13th game so much after seeing this hope this doesn't get shutdown
Terrible teammates sitting around instead of doing gens
Dead in a year DO NOT BUY anything GUN
YES. YES! YES!!!!!! FINALLY
I don't know how to feel about this I do like the Halloween franchise, but the problem is for me is that it's getting created by GUN because after what they did and treated TCM I have no faith in them for Halloween
Looks pretty cool, but the character movement is so choppy. Almost like claymation.
Will Big John and Little John be playable characters?
Singleplayer horror experience… FINALLY! It’s just so sweaty and boring on multiplayer on all kinds of video games these days.
It's a damn shame. We should be hyped because every horror fan been waiting for an official Halloween game. But because of this company's track record 😒  yeah...i highly doubt they will have more passion/care than the fan-made Halloween games. This is just another quick buck for this company. You can tell when a game is made with love. Even if the budget isn't big
I really hope there is a mode where you can play as Michael and a mode where you can play as Laurie. I’m so interested to see what gameplay this is gonna be like as a single player game. LOVE that it’s single player by the way.  ALSO PLEASE BRINGE FRIDAY THE 13th BACK ONLINE GUN AND ILLFONIC.
brooo this looks so ass lmaooo 🥀🥀
Are we ever going to get Michael vs. Jason?
Long awaited, I can't wait to play!!🎃🔪🎃
PLEASE TELL ME LAURIE WILL BE IN THE GAME 🙏
Otro enemigo más para  Dead by daylight a ver cuánto dura 😊
Does he have a tombstone add on though?
Illfonic and Gun working together again, this is gonna be fucking great. They do the best when they make stuff together. Friday the 13th was my favorite asymmetrical horror game ever, and it was because they both made it. When they split and made their own games, Texas Chainsaw and Killer Klowns, it just wasn’t the same.  BUT now they are back together and I’m so excited it’s for Halloween
Please don't buy the season pass people. You don't know when the game will get abandoned & you won't get a refund for the content they said was coming
Please don't support this game, it has Guns name attached. They killed off Texas Chainsaw Massacre when they pledged it wouldn't have the same fate as Friday The 13th. Please don't support it.
Dead by daylight, TCM, Friday the 13th, when you’ve played one, you’ve played them all. Can we please just focus on fresh and new experiences. Im not paying for retro Michael skins from each movie, I’m not paying for a paul rudd skin, I’m not paying for a rob zombie loomis skin. This is just silly. I can see the sizzle reel with Jamie Lee’s likeness from here. Can we please just stop with the nonsense? Don’t give me the surprised Pikachu face once this game flops and your studio bankrupts.
You can’t  imagine how the  Friday the 13th game changed my life for good! Lots of Night playing till 3 o’clock in the morning with  friends, laughing, screaming, and being so excited trying to run from my favorite scary movie character. It was so sad when Jason died!  I’m so excited that after losing that great game we’re getting another one back.  Let the Halloween game last forever!
Yes! Halloween franiche is back! I can't wait to play as Michael Myers!
No no no no no NOT AGAIN
Omggg no way!!! I've been waiting for this day. RAHHHH 😭😭🔥 fucking yessss I can't wait to play it
😂 it's made by GUN. I should be excited but it will be gone by 1 year & a half. Just another copy of F13 🤷🏾‍♀️ same old same old
Evil Never Dies 🎃🔪
HOPEFULLY when this game is released gun will go back to tcm and update it.
they need to make a Scream: The Game now
Big Halloween, please be good and do the franchise justice 🙏🤞
parece juego del 360
Damn think god this Halloween game isn't just online only
Please please don't be asymmetrical like dbd. That game has swallowed whole way too many franchises.
I remember hearing about TCM when it first came out. Couldn't get it because of money problems at the time, which was a good thing anyways, because when I finally decided to buy it a few months later, I saw the state that the game was in,  how the devs were treating the player base and all around lack of communication. That was enough for me to not get it and I'm glad I didn't. So not holding out for too much faith on this game, which sucks because it does look like it would be interesting.. seems like asymmetrical games that isn't dbd seem to flop. I mean look at clowns from outer space I believe? That game didn't last long either.  Edit: killer clown from outer space: the game is the name
Hopefully you dont have a subscription to play this game like you do with the texas chainsaw massacre and killer klowns from outer space because thats bullcrap
Can’t wait for this to come out and hopefully they make a scream game in the future
Friday the 13th is my favorite horror franchise and I loved that game to death. Truly one of a kind for its time, I was so upset when it shut down. TCM was ehhh the maps were too cluttered and gave me headaches trying to chase people down. And GUN gave up on it quick so that made it worse. But even with GUN involved I am so excited for this game I’ve been waiting for a real Halloween game 😈 Bring back Friday the 13th!!! @illfonic
YESSSSS, now Bring Back Friday The 14th, and throw a new game in for Scream and Saw
Not buying another Gun media game again.
Watch this game die and they move on to Freddy Krueger 😂
This looks fantastic! I hope that it lives up to the hype!
YEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
They gave you my boy. Dont. Mess. This. Up. please 😢
All the AI in the world and they went with this horrible Loomis impression 😢
Ждем очередную помойку от GUN
Awesome!! Damn GTA 6 and Halloween. Lotta games I’m excited for that are going to be released🤙
Holy moly this game looks so cool. I am going to get it when it comes out and I’m a huge fan of Halloween.!!!!
gun and illfonics logos appearing is scarier than myers could ever be
FINALLY!!!!
Yooooo for real holy moly Friday 13 th game Texas chainsaw game now Halloween game shiii ... Hope next game is Chucky or scream that be cool
I pray to God they keep this one going
🔥🎃🔥
Только всю серию пересмотрел недавно и тут это! 10/10
Oh boy, another game for Gun to completely ruin and leave for dead lmfao, literally death to anything he touches.
Looks like DBD isn’t getting the license after all
Getting every game before gta6
Those character animations in a rendered cinematic looked rough.
THIS IS BS you can only play it on series my dad won’t buy me a series
omg yess hell yess sirrr
....no
ts better be good
Gun Media 😬😮‍💨 Oh and a horrendous Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) impression! 🤦🏻‍♂️🤣
I hope its like a puppet combo like game but with multilayer
So glad they didn't use that lame rob zombies garbage.
Hyped to see a Halloween game but disappointed that Gun is behind it.
"Oh boy a Halloween game, that sounds-" GUN Interactive.
Single player is gonna be terrifying
It’s probably gonna be horrible but as a Michael Myers fan I’m getting it day one.
I’m not buying the new Halloween game cuz TCM & F13 blah blah GUN Media  … yea yea yea bro 🤓 we ALL know you’ll be there day  I'm buying this game 🤩
Maaan if I can't play Michael Myers parkouring through the background trying to catch up and set up for a spooky kill I don't wanna play it!😅
I know it's Gun but hear me out. If this is the reason they abandoned TCM I'm HERE FOR IT!!! I don't care who made it, give me the O.G Mikeeeee!!!! I've waited for this game my whole life lol
jesus its by GUN again, these guys have no idea how to balance a horror game, think DBD is unfun/unbalanced? youre about to see a whole new level of that!
Yay! El regreso
Fuck yea! Single player only for the best experience
Anyone who see this yall have a bless day in God bless yall and your family and friends and God love yall and I love yall to and here the gospel Corinthians 15:1-4 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein you stand 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures
This type of killer only works in America, no fences and easy access to houses...in South Africa Michael would have to ring the intercom to try and murder people...😂
This is Micheal Myers chance of being in the next mortal Kombat
Gun 😂 milk it
Malek Akkad the GOAT
GUN here to ruin another one 😂
I don't trust Gun anymore, they F'd up so many times already.
Will be a great game for about 6 months to a year. These are the same people that made Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw. At least when Halloween stops being supported, we know they’ll put another horror movie game out.
Please Gun, Don't Screw this up.
Dead by Daylight: Finally a worthy opponent, our battle will be... Wait, I have that character in my game 🗿
Imma kill so many people in this game
I REALLY hope it’s not a dead by daylight type game. If not,maybe at least a story mode would be nice?
“The blackest of eyes”👀💀
Hopefully it comes with tissue
Yall could have gotten a better voice actor to do loomis smh
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🥹
Jesus Christ I’m so sick of horror games that are just asymmetrical bullshit. Granted this probably will go the same route but glad this actually has a single player option
So he liked the idea of Dead By Daylight too much, and now he has his own game.
Can we get a VR version?
Never support gun media for what they did
С нетерпением жду, это будет бомба!) 💥
Bring back games that were like the Friday the 13th game
With Gun involved it's a no. Not after they abandoned TCM. They absolutely cannot be trusted.
I was on a Halloween rabbit hole binge a couple months ago. Now this 😅
If it's anything like Alien Isolation, it will be amazing.
That Donald Pleasance impression is making me wanna get killed by Michael
Hellraiser now Halloween. Single player horror is back and its got licenses baby
Same trailer as dead by daylight 2016 halloween. Like exactly the same. This game will be  a flop. Seems like a chinese copy.
Yooooo
Omg, this is the shape from dbd
Heck ya! 🎃
espero que esté videojuego consiga su reconocimiento
I can't freaking wait to play this!
There needs to be a true co op experience like Cry of Fear
The graphics look a little 2016ish and Micheal’s big ass head looks like it’s a carton game ex:Roblox I hope it improves and goes in to be a great game like Friday the 13th
This is guns last chance man
Dude I love Micheal Myers. Even watching a movie and it takes you back in time looks amazing. The scenery and the instrumentals 😃❤️
I pray that this doesn't turn out like Friday the 13th or evil dead where it died
why does the voice over sound like a bad robotic AI?
TAKE MY MONEY
If it doesn’t have a story mode like GTA does with its game it will flop
I really hope Friday the 13th and Texas chainsaw doesn’t repeat with this one..
Good to hear the legendary Donald Pleasence aka Doctor Loomis!
Looks like Texas chainsaw is coming to an end
¿Así que gun eh...? carajo.
bro that's the guy from dead by daylight!
Better be in the 20-40 game this game will be fun but games like these that focus on a single franchise never last atleast with the companies making this
Welp guess TCM is done for .. lol
Finalmente um jogo do Michael Myers
Dude I been saying that they need to make a Halloween game when they made The Texas Chainsaw Massacure game. It would have so much potential for a good game, AND THEY ACTUALLY DID IT! Im honestly so excited to see what they would do with this.
B. B
i give it 6 months
Im excited to play this game when it releases
Find a new donald pleasance voice actor, that was embarrassing.
Honestly I wish this game all the best since I love Halloween but I can't safely be excited about buying this game seeing that gun media and Illfonic are making it. They screwed up WAY to hard with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and don't even get me started on that stupid law suit that caused their Friday the 13th game to shutdown
Im so ready for 2026 I will definitely be recording this game
Friday the 13th........ so NO.....................
if this game is anything like Jason then im on it day one
Ben Tramer killed those poor people and now its up to Michael Myers to stop him.
The fact it's made by Gun is a death sentence. They are HORRIBLE game developers. Why do they keep getting these big horror titles?
hope they do Terminator next, which they can't be killed but can be overheat (stall) for few seconds which leaves survivor to escape
Happy happy halloween halloween. Silver Shemrock.
Espero que no termine como friday 13 the game
It would be awesome if the game is like Alien Isolation.
He's a little too skinny. Look at his head compared to his shoulders
If actual game footage is not represented, then why show anything at all?
I am happy the game has a singleplayer mode We need more horror games based off franchises that arent just DbD again or are mutiplayer only Hellraiser has one coming too
The immediate synth keyboard sound, shoots me back in time. I can vividly feel my childhood and see people I knew. Strange.
The graphics look like shit
You cant kill the boogyman!
Halloween: The Night HE Became a Gamer!
¡¡I'm so Hyped for this!!
If it's on gamepass I'll play it. If not, then pass. Don't trust Gun with my money.
Finally🍻🪅🥳🎊🎉🥂👯‍♂️👯‍♀️
what gun did w tcm was shitty. but both companies was on f13 and im hype.
IM SO HYPED FOR THIS
Thank god GUN is not developing it after the dumpster fire of texas chainsaw massacre, they never even added single player content lol. Illfonic is the superior developer just look at predator still going!
U people realize F13 only died bc THE LAWSUIT and TCM was a DIFFERENT STUDIO
If its on steam deck, ill get it
"you can't kill the boogie man" goes hard, best line in the first movie
DBD killer
Really?
Please don't suck. 🤞
Hope it's just like f13, single player and all😁🔥🔥😎👍
Lol this dude is so slim. Michael was tall buff dude, not a goofy ahh kpop lover
Why does Michael just walk like a normal person with swag lol, that's so wrong and don't look right
I’m never washing my eyes again I’ve been waiting for this game since I’ve played video games FINALLY!!!! Hellrasier Halloween and a new Friday the 13 game I’m in heaven best news I’ve heard today!!!
can we stop trusting GUN media with these franchises, they're 0 for 2 with live service games :/
I’m so pumped for this! It’s unfortunate that Texas chainsaw massacre died 😢 that game was actually fun as hell. Same with Friday the 13th back in the day.
Aaaah Great! Another game with 2 moths of life before they close the servers forever
Looks sick, but will probably flop like a wet tiddy
Another horror game for Gun to screw up and abandon. No thanks.
Go back and fix Friday the 13th.
I wanna see A Nightmare on Elm Street video game?
Its almost spooky season
I love Halloween. But Illfonic's track record (Evolve, F13TG) has me wary.
About time
Who got Ewan mcgregor to narrate this trailer 😂
BORING
The Donald Pleasence impression is rough
Texas chainsaw dead game
Oh boy, if this game shown? I wonder how the license will effect for myers in dbd?
Ulan yapmasına güzel yapıyorsunuz da iş update'ye gelince yaşsınız be hocam. En azından map gelmese bile her ay new item,new survivor ile güncel tutmalısınız oyunun tutması için.
Ew gun is involved
Finally!!!
You had my curiosity, but now you have my attention.
Gun needs to keep making better versions of what DBD failed to do with licensing. These games are levels above dbd in gameplay and having fun
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO
Prayer been answered 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🎉🎉🎉🎉
Get The F*** Out!   This took longer to come out than it should have. About 40 years too long
HAVE A STORY MODE!!!!!!
Gun is involved with this game! They better not f*** it up and just drop support of it like their last 2 games!
We need a Nightmare on Elm Street Game next
I love how the opening logos remind me of of old movies
My favorite slasher of all-time (as I wear my Walmart Halloween 2 T- shirt) super stoked!
If this is a big budget with good story game then this gonna blow up
You know what, I'll take it over the DBD Game because At least this game gives you a single player choice
This Voice over sucks if you aren't gonna change the dialogue why not give us Lumis? Cause you  didn't want to pay his estate?
Hmm 🤔 what a coincidence, this coming october when behaviour announced a rework on Myers 🫣
This would have been so much better without the voiceover.
only loser skeeter pans still play dbd. 😔
They should have added him in Mortal Kombat 1😢
For everyone worried, illfonic is the main publisher of this game, GUN only helped slightly. illfonic supports their games, has been supporting predator hunting ground since 2020. I think we’ll be good.
I saw the game for sale on switch 2 at my local Walmart the other day??? Wasnt a pre order , has this already been out for the switch??
Christ, I've never seen more bitching and complaining about something that doesn't exist yet in my life 😅.  "This better be good"..and what if it's not? You suing somebody? Going to make a better game? I doubt either
This finna be peak
dbd is going to lose halloween ip kek
Did they use AI for the narrator why does it sound so awful
everybody saying dbd is shit coz yall cant even outrun killers lmao
I hope it’s like Friday the 13th and not like the style of texas chain saw
No thank you!!! Gun interactive is NOTORIOUS for abandoning their games. Look at how they messed up and handled Friday the 13th and then texas chainsaw.   Ditch Gun interactive!
Yes, indeed!!! I’m all for it. Single player, cool. Multiplayer, THANK GOD! I need a good game to play with my crew. Fingers crossed it’s not too convoluted. Give us an “escape the killer and have fun” experience!
LETS GOOOOOOOOO
Hell yeah.
Call John Wick.
Well I hope its a great game. Friday The 13th was great until it went dead for dumb reasons. I hope they have real training unlike Killer klowns or Predator.
Make a version of the game open world where you can arm yourself and kill the bad guys
Scott Jund said it was going to be bad. That means nothing, but it's interesting.
dead game
This looks bad
Illfonic and gun collecting 80’s movie games like Pokémon cards just to abandon them Just as fast.
Wonder if this will be on Switch 2?!
That Donald P. voice is lacking. 👎
It seems that Gun Studios is becoming the equivalent of LJN from wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy back from the days of Nintendo, and all of shitty game licenses that company got their greedy hands on; ALIEN 3, BEETLEJUICE, NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, ETC. James "AVGN" Rolfe was right to call LJN by the name that should live on in infamy; LaughingJokingNumbnuts; and from the looks of things Gun Studios is now the new heirs to that legacy. Way to go Gun, way to fucking go.
Yesss I'm excited 😁
As long as we play as michael, i am happy, no more survivor gameplay, no more happy endings
BRO, LET'S GO. Now i want this more than GTA VI lmao.
A Gun game?? NO THANKS!!! I loved playing TCM until this greedy company managed to wipe out all the players' investment and decided to abandon the game... If it ever becomes free then I'll try it, AVOID ANY GAME FROM THIS COMPANY
Maybe jason could one day return
Is this even a game? I have learned nothing about what this will be.
It will be a cash grab game that is dead within a year but i am sure it will be fun and i look forward to playing it. Gun sucks but they make fun games. Even if they die off fast
So....its. game where you just murder people? Or run from being murdered lol
My beloved Micheal ❤
This is going to be f'n awesome!!
Now you have my attention. Years ago, Friday the 13th was originally supposed to be a single-player campaign, and they made it multi-player due to money issues.  I was hyped for it until that happened.  Some games should be multi-player.  But a classic Jason, Freddy, and Michael should be a story driven game, and it should be made by Capcom. Mr X was scary asf. Could you imagine them making a game with Jason following you around. That would be amazing. Also, the cut scenes would be bad ass.
Here's hoping they get an older actor to do Donald Pleasance's voice for the final product. Yikes.
I'm So Excited Can't Wait For The New Halloween Game And Official Trailer Is So Very Incredible !
bro please be  a supermassive until dawn / the quarry type of game where your choices change the path
2026 deadass could not come sooner. Youre telling me we get GTA 6, lego batman 4, avengers doomsday, spider man 4, the boys season 5, supergirl, scream 7, and now Halloween the game in one year? Holy peak
Ohhhhh hellyeah
Wait what???....
John Wick vs Michael Myers since John is the one you send to kill the fucking boogeyman
A lot of these horror movie based games could work better in a single player mode if they took the alien isolation route
If you fall for buying this and get the GUN treatment in less than a year then, well you deserve it. Such abusive and passive aggressive devs.
How about showing the Fn gameplay footage!? Bloody games today! I don't play games for the cinematic cut scenes. I'd watch the original Halloween movie, if I wanted to have a cinema experience!
Well im sure glad I watched this at night in my backyard taking dog out and I live out in the country so im surrounded by woods. And the 10 year old me will forever be traumatized by the original movie & most of that damn creepy ass theme song that still to this day scares the shit out me. And damn u to my  sister aka metal missy who was 11 years older than me who forced me to watch this movie with her when I was so young.
Yeah ! Single-player is a blessing ! Thx I was lossing hope after so many online only but it seem single player are making a come back ! :)
stop yapping !
GUN never again. another game that will survive for a short time until the Gun kills it again
I Cant wait for this game to come out.
Excited, until i saw Gun. ... then i was disappointed. The i saw illfonic and died inside.  Red flags all over this.
Someone say its 4 ps4
Easy, play DBD, has the Killer and this map. A game that has 9 years and still brings great content. Dont spent your money on these Gun Media scammers. They abandoned Friday The 13th game and Chainsaw Massacre after almost 2 years of its release. Dont complain later, do yourself a favor and dont waste time on these money grabbers. You were adviced.
Hora de ser asesino 😈
🎵When the hands of fate Fall on the midnight hour Behind this mask of hate I don the devil's power If there's life in the shadows Let the knife leave its mark When the certainty of safety feels like stabbing Stabbing in the dark All units respond, multiple fatalities reported on Orange Grove Ave Suspect has been identified as one Michael Myers He is armed and extremely dangerous Shoot to kill, I repeat, shoot to kill over🎵
Me getting ready to hand over money to Illfonic again knowing they’re gonna ditch it as soon as the cash flow starts drying up
glad it's single player
Is there a campaign?
not bad!
Woahhhh🎉
Are we gonna play as Laurie or Michael?
let's see if Illfonic and Gun support a game longer than 6 months this time
Everyone that's complaining about gun and tcm what did yall actually expect from that game?? There's not much you can do with the leather face IP.
I expected cat in the hat wtf
Was hyped until I saw Gun is on the project..
The VO i cant take serious but it looks amazing
Анимации кайф) Моушн капчу делали с солеаых
I always said we needed more games out of scary movies or something with the killers. Hopefully we see more! Imagine a jeepers creepers game or Texas chainsaw massacre game 🔥
.... is this whole trailer made with AI... like, even the voiceover does not sound human.
Thank God! Single player... Hell Yea 🔥🔥. We Seriously need more of these types of horror games
God gave us this because we’ve been good!
Why's his head so damned big?
The developers should have had J from WEWATCHEDAMOVIE voice Dr Loomis!!! GODDAMN YOU MICHAEL!!!
Soooo.. You dont got rights for Donald Pleasences voicelines?  That was horrifying for the ears, i hope that the game is better
nooo i wanted F13 :( like the old one!!
Something about this doesn't feel right.
This might be the answer.. if Gun focused on SP gsmes -that dont need the neverending updates etc - that this might be where their exceptional commitment to detail in-game honouring its source can flourish
Lets go always wanted this
I love the stylized graphic and title cards that they deliberately made like how they are in the film, with grain and frame rate everything
lol, they seem like the Sims talkingf
NO WAY
Gun should be paying US to play their games at this point. who ever gave them the rights to this game .. smh. obvious cash grab. Friday was one thing. TCM was another. incompetent, lying, gas lighting arrogant dev team at Gun.
This got me hype!
please make this game different from every other asymmetrical multiplayer horror games. Stop trying to compete with dbd. That game has its issues but has ten years worth of content and characters. Plz focus on the single player.   Predator Hunting Grounds - Dead Texas Chainsaw - Dead Evil Dead - DEAD Killer Klowns - Dead  Even more to list. Please make this game different.
Omg they finally did it !!!
I see GUN is one of the devs on the new Halloween game. Honestly, I’m trying to look at it in a positive way these are the same people who gave us F13. That game has a cult following, it’s iconic, and we all still love it. So I’ve got high hopes they can give us something like that again, with endless memories.
oooouknowhowlongggibeenwaitingfordiss
Oh great. Another asymmetrical game. Because there's no other asymmetrical horror games and this is an original idea.
2026!!!
Gun.? Nah I'm good.
Childhood dream
Is this for the ps3?
Oh god, it's IllFonic and Gun Media again lmao
Who got excited until they seen the Gun and Illfonic logos 😂
I really hope it is not another DBD game,  we deserve some good slasher game
Ah yes another dead by daylight clone
FINALLYYYY🔥🔥🔥 HALLOWEEN GAME AFTER ALL THESE YEARS!!!! GAWWDAYYUM.
Me dan mas miedo las desarrolladoras que Michael Myers ☠☠☠☠
They abandoned Friday the 13th (ok this one they didn't have options), then... abandoned Predator Hunting Grounds, then... abandoned The Texas Chainsaw. How am I suppose to trust this dudes NOW?
Imagine being so much of a loser, you get excited about video games..
Hopefully when it comes out it's not as glitchy, lack support as teh Friday the 13th game of a few years BACK...
It'll be good but way better if its virtual reality
Dr. Loomis voice is TERRIBLE>....
Ugh I'll be so scared to play this in the dark, I'm 30😂
We lost F13 and gained Halloween. If this turns out alright, I'm fine with the trade!
Single player? Hell yeah!
October 2026 release Halloween 😁
Guy from Fortnite btw
Is this for real ?
I cannot wait to play the new Halloween game we finally got it. I knew what they’re gonna make that.
I will not be fooled a third time, Gun.
As a fan of the franchise, this is exciting. We have to support this! Especially with dbd dropping the ball again and again and again, give them some actual competition
Yo this game is gonna be fire
Is she drunk? Who runs like that...
Is this the Friday the 13th game reincarnated pretty much?
EYACULÉ HASTA EL TECHO
Why does it look like ass
If they were smart and not lame they would make it like the Manhunt games, and give us what weve really been wanting.
Couldn't have gotten an actual English guy to voice Loomis?
I love how the entire gaming community agrees that the single player experience is the best type of gaming.
I smell an reenactment of chainsaw massacre
The Shape Stalks the Night
DMX did this theme justice on one of his songs....hear growling
Texas chainsaw should have had also a single player
They'll definitely ditch this in a couple months after its release
dropping the trailer to halloween right before halloween then saying it wont be here till next year at some random fuckass time is grounds for avoiding this game entirely
Fuck yes!!!
Hell yeah! I have personal history with the Halloween Franchise (watched part 4, 5 and parts of 6 filmed on my street and neighborhood as a child.   So I have always loved this series of movies. Part two scared the daylights out of me as a small child! 😳😳😳 🔪 🎃   I am stoked for this game!!!
I love it.
Not really a good trailer but seems interesting none the less. Especially if there's a full single player
Hyped for this. Now I just need alien isolation 2🔥
Friday the 13th is making a come back
Whys everyone shitting on gun media? Friday the 13th was awesome and i thought ppl loved TCM?
O' man, I've been trick or treated to death. You don't know what death is!
“Single player experience” sounds like a fancy way of saying “hide and seek horseshit but with bots.”
Our player base is dying after a week with this one
Fuck this company. They make terrible games
Oh please not again
Damn, first the Hellraiser revival and now this. It seems like it’s a new beginning for horror movies turning into video games.
Michael on that Ozempic also
That's a really solid Pleasance. He has his intonations down pat.
it doesnt look great. which it very well should.
that was terrible
Gun and Illfonic? Yeah, I've seen this before.
That was a nothing burger.  Soooooo what are we getting for a game?
I think I just came in my pants  a little bit
👀🔥.. - Sâ©️
Damn 2026. Was hoping for a nice Fall Halloween single player, but whatever. Hope the single player is solid because I'm over my multiplayer days as a 40yr old, lol.
Yooo that's the Shape chase theme from Dead by Daylight!!!
Let's fucking go !!!!!!
God damn that Loomis voice over was terribly cringe and utter garbage. I hope this game turns out amazing
Bro I’m praying to the god this does not die in the future after 2026 because after how Friday The 13th: The Game was treated it’s making me anxious.
Is this like friday the 13th multiplayer game? Cause that would be amazing
As long as it doesn’t flop or get the shitty Friday the 13th game I’m all for it
IGN Real Fans Are You Here ❤ 🍓
Hopefully it’s not another cashgrab unbalanced mess and they actually play their game so they can know what changes to make. Doubt it isn’t but I am eager to see more of the game!
Yes, this is going to be fantastic
Like Mike, this franchise will NEVER die..
I'm definitely rooting for this game, but if it suffer the same fate as Texas Chainsaw Massacre then we're gonna have a problem
YES HALLOWEEN GAME? YESS!🙏🏽🎃🎃 hope theres alot of things to unlock costumes and stuff.
Dude. They had one job 🤦🏾‍♂️ how TF did you get his proportions off? Look how big his damn head is and how little his shoulders are? Seriously y'all need to redo the modeling.
Take my money
he's out there yall.... the boogeryman
Looks so cool
I'm so ready
Gonna be just like the Tcm game watch
Illfonic literally destroyed Ghostbusters gaming with spirits unleashed, and this doesn't look any more promising. Visuals look like the Sims played on a Nokia.
the animation for michaels walk was kinda weird but so far looks pretty good
I love this franchise I’ve been hoping to get my hands on a game one thing I really want to see is where you can customize Michael and Laurie
Look like another boring dead by daylight Texas chainsaw 😂 u win make it to the next day then what do it again 🥱
Saw Gun at the end and lost all hope
nga wtf is this
Oh wow
Looks good. Dr. Loomis voice is a bit sketch, though.
Fun fact: Kobe Bryant would have the halloween theme song playing on repeat before games.
This game better give credit to John Carpenter!
I'm keen to see this one... But I hope one day they also get the rights to do a 'Scream' game too
GET MALCOLM MCDOWELL!!!!!
I’m sorry gun but after how y’all did Texas chainsaw ima have to pass
single player threw a smile on my face
Thank God They're finally making a game about Michael Myers. I wonder how they're gonna do this one. I hope they don't make it like they did with Friday. The 13th, because the game was good, a nice multiplayer game. You can play and you get to play as Jason or a camper. But there really was no story, like they couldn't like do a story mode or like I don't know. Maybe something with that, but hopefully, with Michael Myers, they're able to do something a little bit better. It's better, it did say it was a single player. And multiplayer game. Now the question is, that is there gonna be a story for you to play and is there anything else you can do with this game like, is it a third person? First person, second person and also if you play as Michael Myers, does that mean if you played in first person you'll literally see from his point of view? Hear his breathing under the mask and maybe possibly see through his mask. But then that would be a little bit too difficult for the players. So just maybe his breathing and see everything he does in first person, but I don't know. I don't know how they're gonna do it, but I hope it's a good one, because I haven't played the Friday. The 13th game because of reasons, but I hope this game of Halloween will give me A. Reason to actually play it and actually start gained the spirit of actually playing them games, relate to horror franchises.😮😮😮😮🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Yesir!!
Please be a story mode
Gawd, that looked and sounded like shit
What a time to be alive !!!
Better Haddonfield Map than in DBD
Oh okay cool
Are we going to see Jamie Lee Curtis?
I was excited but I saw that GUN is making the game. They will massacred the game like they did with TCM
As cool as it looks the moment I saw GUN media it kinda killed my hype. Their track record with supporting their games hasn’t been great. They struck lightning with F13 and let it rot along with Texas.
Her running was seriously cartoony... and they got Myers' breathing wrong.... and of cos the Loomis-ish narrator sounds like he's waiting for his paycheck.
ILL FONIC AND GUN MEDIA, THE F13 GANG IS BACK THANK THE HEAVENS
OMG I LOVE MICHAEL MAYERS YESS
Just bring back Friday the 13th
Gotta work on that character design.  His head looked too big.
Eww Gun entertainment. Gg no re
Is there an official release date?
No, This franchise needs to go away now. 😂 Sad to say.
The trailer looks awesome. I'm definitely not buying it day 1 because of the comments but for a fair price and single player I will
Gun will say the game peaked after two maps added and jump ship to another game.
😍
No way let’s goo after it’s 48th anniversary
Can it please be like Michale is a compute tired of online players being in control
I saw Illfonic and noped out immediately! They dropped the ball big time with Predator Hunting Grounds all those years back and will probably do the same with Halloween.
I wish Gun add a Single player Story for friday the 13th and Texas chainsaw massacre to make them re-playable😢
Hes not the boogieman though. You're crossing myths.
I'm definitely playing as Michael
nice to see singleplayer but it should be singleplayer only an first person
AYO!!!
YESSS SINGLE PLAYER FINALLY I’m tired of DBD like horror games
😂OH MY ANOTHER GUN MEDIA GAME😂
another game from gun interactive bruh bruh bruh they just keep releasing game and dying again and again why ? no battle pass system no free content just dlc to milk money from players
I love the trailer but the Doctor's voiceover sounded a bit robotic and AI sounding. Am I wrong to assume that? 🤔
Just be better than Halloween ends that's all I ask.
This trailer was amazing. Hopefully the single player experience is indeed an experience. I need a full story mode.
Watch it be a 1 hour single player story then the rest just be copy and paste multiplayer modes from dead by daylight
YESS!! Halloween is one of those childhood movies for me so I’m excited for this
2026? Why not for this holiday season?
Looks like a Telltale game
replace run button with stand and scream button replace dodge button with stumble and fall button
Hope I can use Tombstone Myers in this game!
To those saying that after GUN was revealed as a co-developer, they wouldn't touch this game even in their worst nightmares.  As scary as it could be, I wouldn't worry too much. Why, you may ask? Well, IllFonic is the main developer for this game. And Malek Akkad owns ALL the rights to the IP as a whole (all movies and other media) and he himself wouldn't agree to do a game, if it's going to be forgotten in a few year's time. He would be the first person to go forward and sell the game to a new studio. Also, John Carpenter himself is intimately involved with the project.
CALLED THAT SHIT FROM ORBIT HELL YEAH SINGLE PLAYER TOO? OHHHH BEAUTIFUL
If it bleeds, we can kill it!
Halloween Coming in 2026
dont screw it up
Yesssss Halloween 🎃 drop it on Halloween 🎃 nexx year
Finally so excited for this. It's been a long time coming. Mike has always been the goat I hope someone does scream next that would be awesome. Being able to choose the dialogue when making phone calls. 😊😊😊
Please just give us a good single player experience. JUST FOCUS ON A DAMN STORY!
I CANT WAIT IVE BEEN SAYING FOR YEARS I WANT A HALLOWEEN GAME
This looks almost like a carbon copy of the Dead By daylight trailer 😭😂
It's gonna be a shitty game, GUN made the game, they destroyed Friday the 13th, they gave up on Texas Chainsaw Massacre, don't buy this crap they don't deserve money
Amazing!🖤🎃
Yes yes I can’t wait to play this but frist day it come out
Thank f'ing god it's not another dead by daylight dlc.
Man I want a Nightmare On Elm Street game, the possibilities with the dreams is endless.
Man don't play with my emotions
I hope the gameplay is similar to Friday the 13th.☺️
Same studios behind Friday let's goooooo
Looks cool
Watch this game turn out to be like texas chainsaw massacre and flop😭🙏 I pray it won’t and it’s actually good
Need to fix that walk animation. Michael doesn't really move his arms when he walks
If they actually include the real themes within the game, it's going to be epic! 🎃
Good, maybe they can abandon it like they did F13. Now before you run your mouth I was a backer long before it was F13 and I know these fuqin people. They were very aware of the lawsuit and instead of releasing and then polishing the content they did their stupid fuqin game engine that looked worse really. Fuq them. Remember, people did get the final Jason and kills with an update so it was done enough. Fuq off
Omg my favorite horror character of all time finally gets a game lets go im so hyped 🙌
FINALLY!
I’ll give GUN one more chance. Texas chainsaw was a stinker in my opinion, it was fun for a bit but not enough. Let’s hope they make an actual single player mode. Not just an afterthought.
This game will be dead on release just like Predator and Killer Clowns before getting abandoned a few months later.
Só eu que achei um modelo do  Myers esquisito ?
It’s going to flop like the other games did. Evil Dead died fast. Texas Chainsaw Massacre died fast. The Jason game died fast. Bro it’s just gonna be the same thing. I’m still going to play it though. 😂
Sold!
Ilfonic is 3 for 3 with horror IPs they gave up on, at this point im praying it will be good
Stabbing in the dark ice nine kills
Can't wait until "The night he comes Home"🎃🪦🎃
The graphics look… questionable
Ugh coulda had made it more realistic Just don’t seem like it’s going to be good ! Especially with gun behind this who knows at this point
ROFL, who animated the running, looks like something from the 90s.
It’s cool but I’m no longer buying games from gun anymore!!!!
Until I seen gameplay...I kan't allow myself to be too overhyped even tho Halloween is my favorite movie of all time..I just know from F13,Evil Dead,TCM, how they all ended up🫠🫠🫠..I'm surprised Killer Klowns is still alive at this point...we shall see ig....
I hope we get a rob zombie Michael Myers skins, that boogieman is frightening
Finally a single player offline game,  Online only transvestite bull shit can f..k off
Gun???... ahh shit...
I have high hopes for this hopefully it doesn’t end up like Texas chainsaw massacre
YESSSSIRR
It’s Jaime Lee Curtis as Michael Myers
A Freddy game would've been more exciting
why micheal myers is a framecel?
These are the same guys that made Friday the 13th the game. I have full faith that this’ll be a great game considering how good FT13th is. I didn’t play FT13th nearly enough as I should’ve done, and I didn’t learn about the servers shutting down until a while afterwards. Multiplayer FT13th was so damn fun, and it’s great to see it coming back for this, along with singleplayer.
Hell yes.
Oh boy, another DBD dlc
This voice over is a disgrace
The Micheal Myers model looks a tad bit cartoony. Especially by the face. And woah... those graphics! The wavy grass, just look at the contrast and saturation. This absolutely gives off a flair correlation to those 90s horror movies! Listen to that tip toe-crip toe theme for this as well. From my viewpoint, this COULD do well, this game's success might pull through for a single player game. Micheal's knife is accurate, this might actually do well and looks like a game I'd play!
Loomis sounds like crap and Michael looks like he's smirking wtf
this and hellraiser i have hope for
illfonic & gun = abandonware
Illfonic and gun interactive making another horror game from a 1970-1980 film? it’s gonna last two years, have problems with hackers, then the devs will give up on it. like seriously… look what happened to f13 and tcm, this game is a bomb waiting to explode 😂
Gun media 🫩
The character movement is stiffer than a priest dick 🤣
Another 1v4 game..... yayyyyy......😒
Welcome back to haddonfield
I'm stoked but we gotta get a better voice for Dr Loomis man... Come on now
it FINALLY happened...
Hopefully this time it won't be stuck in licence disputes and shut down
Loomis sounds like Ewan McGregor.
Please please please add the Halloween 2018 skin!!!! I beg of you!!!!
Big ass head
Give it a year they’ll never fix the bugs and abandon the game
The voice actor was great, felt as close to Donald as we'll ever get with the exception of Tom Jones in Halloween Kills.
THIS IS INSANE!. Still gunna miss friday the 13th though 😢💔🎉
Bet you it’s gonna be a subscription lol
"Do you believe in the boogeyman? You should..." 🎃
I want it
I still watch all the halloween movies,2 was a fav for me
Well... There goes another Friday the 13th, that will die 2 years later
how long can they hold up the rights to the character?
Gun.  Nuff said.
Based on the graphics, looks like it could even run on an iPhone
Can't wait to play this game religiously for a few months till it dies lol
I hope this game can last and be good but GUN has a bad rap
Im never buying anything from gun  after Tcm they can fuck right off
Yeah I'm actually glad there's a single player mode hopefully it's just based around a story that would be awesome like I'm tired of dead by daylight copy and paste games.
“Gun.” *Friday the 13th flashbacks*
Multiplayer games can get fucked, Multiplayer was only good before everything became a culture war.
VR gonna get crazy 😅😂
Don't get hyped it's gun
Literally the horror game I've always wanted. Expecting the worst but hoping for the best.
Not the PTSD symptoms getting triggered by everyone in the comment section after they see Gun's involvement 💀💀💀
What are these graphics man Jesus I swear I’m almost so done with gaming bruh 🤦🏾literally finna retire from ts
It’s not October yet
Probably will be another dead by daylight carbon copy but riddled with bugs and crappy overcharged cosmetic separately paying content.
GUN? Game’s dead in the water already. They’ll announce a nightmare on elm street game right as this one is gasping its last breath.
Well I guess as long as we have single player mode the game won’t die
Gun? Game won’t last 3 months. You’ll get poor updates and lazy feedback from devs
I really hope this is more single player than it is multi player. My time is already divided between Marvel Rivals and Fortnite and I'm an adult with a night shift job. I don't have time to invest in another multi player game that will just go offline in 5 years when the IP license expires. I want a GOOD single player experience that I can come back to year after year without fearing that it'll be delisted and taken away from me.
voice over is atrocious
Looks awful! This will be a low quality cash grab, guaranteed.
Is this a movie 😮
I love that Dr.Loomis is a part of this game, but that is about the worst approximation and performance trying to mimic him I may have ever heard. It's like your friend at the party doing a Donald pleasence  impersonation. .
Bruh i was relief when it said single player, I'm sick and tired of horror games becoming like Dead by Daylight.
It's about time but definitely gonna be worth it
I predict it will be bad
Animation looks awful
I heard Skermz got hired to play Myers
Nope. Not giving Gun and Illfonic my time and money anymore. They have proven that they will support a game on its first year then leave it to die after that. Predator hunting grounds, they still milk it, releasing DLC but no more maps or literal QoL changes. Texas Chainsaw Massacre, a lot of "we can't do that" attitude, neglected easy ideas to make the game more enjoyable and left to rot. I bet this single player mode will be a hollow offline mode for the multiplayer with bots, the bare minimum while they sell you DLC. Somebody needs to sue these companies
YES
I sure hope this game will be better than the last 2 dogshit movies.
Mayers looks too skinny? Too short? There’s something off, making him less imposing as you see him in the movie.
This trailer went so hard I can’t get over it 🔥🔥
Really need a Scream game 🔪🔪🔪
I frl thought it was another movie I was so excited 😭 but a Halloween game that sounds fire!
Guarantee this ends up being complete garbage and dead within a year
YES!!!!!!!!
"He's gonna get you. He's gonna get you. He's gonna get you. He's gonna get you. He's gonna get you. He's gonna get you."
Gun Media and Illfonic. 🤮  will never trust these two again.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT DEATH IS
My favorite fictional serial killer!! Can’t wait!
First thing I think of whenever I hear Sam Loomis : I SHOT HIM SIX TIMES!
Hopefully this isnt a DBD type of game and it actually has a story and you play as Michael. Getting tired of the multiplayer games, it shouldn't be that hard to make a single player horror game based on Jason, Leatherface or Michael Myers.
This got Friday the 13 written al over it will go down in like a year or to well see sadly
What is this game going to do for the multi-player genre that DBD or Friday hasn't already done especially with only 1 killer... Meh
WANT. NOW.
Awesome! Hopefully it doesn't suffer the same fate as F13 and end up like TCM after just two years?
sooo same devs as chainsaw texas and friday 13th games, game's gonna flop
Wow. Whoever’s doing the Donald Pleasence impression  should be legally be restricted from ever doing it again.
Welcome home michael...
They better keep the shades in the game so at least it feels like it’s really night time
FINALLY!!! I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SOOOO LONGGGGG!!!!!!
John wick is the one who kills the bogeyed man.
Remember illfonic and gun made Friday the 13th then abandoned it and shut it down and didn't refund anyone.
cant wait to see how the mechanics of hiding under a white sheet will play out.
The part where we scroll past the house with blood staines and then to the house with victims still alive is scary.  It shows before anyone noticed what he was doing, he already got to someone else.   Imagine a deranged maniac that loves to kill on your street at Halloween night. You look across the street and see blood stains on the wall in your neighbors house. Must be decorations right?   Your neighbors screaming next door? A horror movie marathon. Gotta be.  And you? You’re home alone. Tired. Just enjoying tv. Maybe your with your partner, and you go to the kitchen to pop a bag of popcorn.  Did you leave the back door open? How silly of you. But that’s ok, you’ll close it.   **click**  And then you come back and find your partners throat cut open. And all you hear is heavy breathing.   Game looks nice!
Jason: heh, loser
Can you be Michael  cause mannnn the carnage
Yep, will be getting that 4sho!!!
How will this game be any different than Texas Chainsaw Massacre or the Space Jokers?
They really need to change the Michael Myers mask, if that's what it looks like. Why does it look so fat and round? Hideous.
Hopefully it's better then then the Jason game
Michael Myers is the scariest, since 1978
Give it a good 8 months after launch before it ends up just like how Gun did with TCM
Gun Media sucks. lol
Can someone tell me why people are against Gun being involved with this game? I don’t know anything about them.
the torso doesn't match the mask i feel like
Its still an asym game guys
I hope we can play as Michael!
Please no more Multiplayer horror character games i just want single player story version of them with a good story and gameplay thats hella fun give us like silent hill 2 but with these characters and have a separate mode where is the story as playing as the killer as well we need SCREAM GAME
From the creators of the F13 game!!!!!!! Hopefully licensing and rights don't kill this game as well!!!! Extremely excited for this now
I'm curious to see if GUN learned from their mistakes. Hell, I hope they at least called the guys who did Retro Realms  Halloween vs Evil dead, for some pointers.
It'll get shut down after a month or something because it looks too good to be true, so something's definitely going to go horribly wrong
gun media fuck no bro fuck offf
How do the same people acquire these IP's just to make a game that shuts down after a year
When? Freddy Krueger 😢
Cool. I can't wait for GUN to abandon this game too.
I hope it’s not like dead by daylight gameplay
Go home Myers!
Maybe just maybe we are over the era of every horror game based on a movie being an asym multiplayer, hope single player means an actual story driven survival horror and it's not just a bait
Made by GUN? is dead already.
This game looks so peak for no reason
hope the multiplayer is like friday the 13th.
Thank God finally, I can't wait to play this game i just hope it's on PS5.
So Michael Myers killed Leatherface...
Will the multiplayer just be like Friday the 13th game?
We just need monehhhh 😢😢😂😂
Looks Great, hopefully there is a storyline and not just single player killing bots.
Stop giving Gun. Games bruh
Bro all I ask is use this ip to its full potential. A Micheal Myers video game done right could be goated AF!!!
cant wait for it to die in 2 weeks like all the others
Looks a lot better than the Atari version
Sick, *ANOTHER* horror icon live service 1 v 5 game that *SURELY* won't lose it's license after a year of milking the delusional defenders "bUt ThIs Is DiFfErEnT tHaN dEaD bY DaYlIgHt" and close up shop to find another icon to repeat the cycle with...
The houses look like current day houses.
Sharing
For everyone hyped, I need you to dial it down for your own sake. This is Gun Media making this, do kindly remember that.
Sick
Kendrick shout was crazy "You can't kill the Boogeyman"
If they do this right, I think DBD is going to have some competition. And rightfully so. I think I speak for most when I say we’re tired of all the updates and bug issues that never seem to get fixed or take forever. Bhvr better get their stuff together.
This is gonna b sick. We got Friday and Halloween coming soon. What more could us gamers ask for.
Is the voiceover ai?
Since Gun decided to stop working on Texas Chainsaw Massacre, they had better make up for it with this game. I have high hopes, but they could easily break.
why is he so skinny
Will never support anything that Gun touches
Hell yeaaahh The Shape has is own survival horror game!!! It'll be awesome playing as Mr. Myers a.k.a. The Shape himself!!
A steaming pile of ass
The mask looks a tad bit too big. Otherwise im HYPED 🙌👀🔥
It’s Gunn but atleast it’s Single-player
I have very low expectations. These games wouldn’t get a pass if horror fans weren’t so desperate for games related to these IP’s. Gun & IllFonic just keep releasing mediocre crap that is totally unsustainable for one reason or another.
Meh. Kinda hard to get stoked for something with Gun involved.   A shame because I admire their dedication to the source material and eye for detail.
Was hoping it was coming out this Halloween...damn
I know how it ends
I pray this is gonna be good!!!
Why is the announcer from temu. Just straight butt cheeks
Stop! You making me dance
Why Michael’s head looks so big 😂
This will be EPIC!
If he breathes & bleeds he can be killed. Dang you Myers..
Ya le hizo vídeo reaccion Genuine993. Espero qué sea el sucesor de Viernes 13
Holy 5090
Nope. Not trusting Gun ever again.
Why did the voice acting sound AI... is it because...?
Yay!!
Asymmetrical horror is a dead genre but I might play single player
First Hellraiser then Halloween hell yeah! Now I just want Freddy Kruger and Terrifier. And ill be a happy horror fan.
So cool that they gave The Shape from hit asym horror multiplayer game Dead by Daylight his own video game! I always found his lore so rad! Maybe he should get his own movie or something someday.
Pass
Gun... Ew these guys just keep jumping ship every game they do.
I Hope This Is Very Real I’ll believe it When I See It 💯💯 Lol My Name Is Michael 🔪
Gee I wonder what day in 2026 it will come out, if it isn’t Halloween day just don’t even do the game lol
Bro is that ai voice from the professor? I hope it’s not and you hired a good voice actor.
I hope this plays like F13
The scariest music of all time
"ooga booga" - michael myers
I have waited for this for so long.  Thank you so much for single player.  I hate playing online i just want to have fun.
It’ll excite the public for a bit until they realize they just play in neighborhood maps against Myers every time.  Unfortunately it’ll die just like all the other IPs like Ft13, Evil Dead, TCM and Killer Klowns.  They should be making single player only experiences like the new Hellraiser game since they unfortunately will never take down the monopoly DBD has on the genre.
Its going to be a direct follow up to Friday the 13th on the original 8-bit NES system.
Gun 😮‍💨 games already doomed before it started
This is the exavt Game i have been Waiting for im fucking Buzzing
Im not gonna buy another gun product
To anyone wanting to buy this please do not. Gun media does not care about you or their game. They just want to come out with as many cosmetics and unwanted content to cash grab as much money as they can from you and then kill the game.
Between it having single player and John Carpenter's involvement, I'd say we might have a good game.
If you don't have a single player then I don't care about the trash
So hyped until the moment I saw Gun on the name.
gun = dead game
Hell yeah!
This might be the new best horror game of 2026
❤️🎃
If only they made this game for switch!!!!
All of this but scrap the Loomis narration. It's terrible.
Bryan Kohberger will definitely be pre ordering it & playing it on his tablet
Looks better then the new black opts7 trailer 😂
Michael…? 👀
The woman running out of the house was ugly
I had a feeling they was dropping his chapter next🔥🔥🔥
Plz take my money
not a fan of loomis' va...there's too much effort in his voice. it's loomis...but it's...off. some VAs can pull off a seamless immersive recreation of a legacy actor. this guy doesn't, at all, and pulled me right out of the experience
Can’t wait for this all the guys we on this all night 😂😂
The skins bouta go crazy🔥
OMG YESSSSSS!!!! I WAS HIGHLY ANTICIPATING THIS
the voice acting in this trailer is terrible, animation is good trhough
Not real! The John Carpenter game that's coming out is Toxic Avenger, not Halloween, new it wasn't real
I’m tired man
A lot of people are saying this will be abandoned. It will be. If it were single-player, that would be a different story, but since it's multiplayer, it will, just look at the track record. Games like a track record, as Gun will easily tell you what to expect. Thinking otherwise is a fool's errand. Ever heard of War Z or Infestation Survivor stories? Yeah, if a company doesn't change its act after the first couple of games, safe to say that's what you should be expecting.  All of their multiplayer games, which I think they haven't done singleplayer yet, besides that new Hellraiser game, which could be good since it is single player, you're buying the experience, nothing more, and you shouldn't expect much more from a single player game besides a potential DLC in the future. Every single multiplayer game they've made went down the shitter after the first couple of years. Just be cautious and expect this game to die after a good year or two. Won't be around for very long, if your fine with that, it'll be a fun game, but just don't expect long support, especially from Halloween, just not much content to be had there to begin with. Sure this game is shipping with singleplayer mode but it'll be safe to say the Online portion is where most of your fun will be had.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 finally
As long as I can run around as Chad in leapoard print underpants dancing like Katy Perry, i'm in.
Why does he walk so awful? 😂
Hell yeah!!!!
Not a good sign to see the team who made the TCM working on this
Halloween game? This was unexpected. Love the song. Huge Halloween fan so i will 100% be buying this. Pretty excited for Hellraiser too. We need more horror single player games.
This is another game im preordering
Mmmiiiccchhaaaeelll 😂lol ya home 🏡
I heard that it's being released at it's full potential.
Please tell me this is real
We need a DBD killer . Please make this game great and give us a game where we don’t need gens and flashy saves lol
I hope this is real!
Lets fucking gooo
Take my money right now
Jason, Hellraiser, evil dead and now Michael Myers! Wow
Finally Is About Time Michael Myers Gets His Own Video Game And I Will Be Happy To Play It Once It Comes Out Next Year But Also We Should Get A Other Halloween Movie Soon As Well. 🎃
Produced by Gun? NOPE
This was so unnecessary to make…
Flop
I hope this is better than DBD, that game has been horrible for years!
1:31
This pleases me.
what is that character model for mike meyers? big ass head and narrow shoulders. like what this scrawny lil guy gonna do?
Boooooo Gun. "We've put our heart into this game for the last 18 months but must end all development/support" Stay tuned for our next exciting IP!
Recast whoever is doing Dr Loomis' voice. Terrible. Can't take it seriously at all.
SINGLE PLAYER FOR SURVIVORS IS A MUST!!!!
So Friday the 13th with a Halloween skin
this is gonna sickkkkk! but RIP TCM
Michael fucking myers!!!!!!! Lfg
This is going to be awesome! Michael Myers to me was scarier than Jason or Freddy. It will be cool to play as him.
why is Gun still allowed near video games
Another game they’ll abandon! Hurray!
Anyone who trusts gun at this point is just gullible. This game will last a year then get shut down like all their games.
HELL YEAH!!!🤘😎🎸
Looked really janky
Tame. Maybe this was considered horrific in the 60s but today it's just a Tuesday.
I hope Gun sees how we HAVEN'T forgotten what happened with TCM.
Might as well drop Halloween 2026
🎃 He came Home
Que perfeição ❤❤😃
It will have single player story mode ,online and offline mode
Looks banger!! Actually maybe a bit excited for this
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
Please be good and dont abandon it
I was honestly excited until I saw that gun was involved.
arent those gun. guys the same ones who did that awful balanced pay to win Texas Chainsaw Massacre game? come on they have a lot to prove this time
That narration was awful and is this single and multiplayer like Friday 13th was... If so I'm guessing a lot of people will be waiting on a sale due to bad faith
They could've done better on it ngl
Let’s hope this does better than TCM.
Hellraiser getting a single player  horror game and now Halloween, Hopefully they don't flop because I need some more horror games
One last chance, Gun. One last chance. You’ve got Micheal Myers in your hands. Don’t fumble him after you fumbled Bubba.
On 1/1/26 I’ll be like “Great Happy new year now WHERE’S MY MICHAEL MYERS GAME?!?” I promise you
We need a single player version, where the story mode involves the movie plot but like a gta style killing where you can only kill at night in various ways or what not. I’m pretty sure someone has an idea on how to make it work instead of always 4v1 multiplayer
why do they move like sims lmao and why does the narrator sound like he's doing a parody of the original guy?
I won’t be buying this game
Battle Royale?
Should be coming out on Halloween day
Gun Interactive🤝Illfonic when it comes to acquiring franchise licenses and making a nothing burger of a game then going onto the next franchise game again and again until the inevitable heat death of the universe.
I hope there's a car. Makes escaping way more fun 🚗 💨🍃
Well another one that's going to be added to my list first they're coming out with hellraiser which is awesome and I'm going to get that and now this 👏👏👏👏👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 Noiceee 😎
Single player? My wife and I are stoked!
It looks great!  However, as a consumer, look up the following and see where the games ended up before making the decision to buy this one or not:  - Friday the 13th - Texas Chain Saw Massacre - Predator: Hunting Grounds   Killer Klowns is still being supported, which is good but the playerbase has fallen on pc.
Imagine a Halloween game but in the style of Alien Isolation where Michael learns your moves while hunting you down. If they could make him even stealthier and could learn by watching as well while he is stalking that would be phenomenal.
Plot Twist: The real horror is Gun abandoning yet another game and killing another IP, oof sends shivers down my spine
If only I can turn back time and rematch the Halloween movies as kid! The opening theme song is just so iconic!
Oh good, so we’ll have a couple of years to play it before Gun completely abandons it like they did with both Friday the 13th and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Can’t wait 🤦🏻‍♂️
I got my hopes up. Then I saw it was a Gun. Game
It better not be like those Friday the 13th game and dead by daylight
Oh great another game from Gun/Illfonic. Wonder if this will be a temporary game like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Evil Dead, and Friday the 13th. I give this game 3 months tops before it gets abandoned.
I want a single player game for all the horror icons that would be amazing
Lmao fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me fool me 3 times I can’t get fooled again!
"This isn't a man..."
That Dr. Loomis voice is just terrible but still pumped up
Single-player I can't wait
I know it says “single player and multiplayer experience” but I’m not convinced. I’ve seen some games with “single player” that is basically just a long tutorial.
Hopefully GUN doesn’t ruin this like Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw Massacre
LETS GO PAUL RUDD!😂
My favorite Mike Myers
tuffff
They ruined Friday the 13th day one by being multi player only, then tcm , so thank God this is single player too
🤯
Hopefully gun doesn’t crack again.   These IPS deserve loyal devs who don’t jump ship when it gets hard.
Until gun interactive changes, dont support them.
Do we play as Michael?
Dmn I thought we ere getting  something good to watch for Halloween
Please make your mask proportional to your body, the mask or head is very large.
Oh no...Gun Media is behind this game? That can't be good...
All I can say is that, moving forward, I truly hope we get story mode in these kinds of games. Multiplayer-focused games are nowhere near as exciting to me as a fully fleshed out story!
Yes!
why should I trust gun
Made by gun, no thanks bro i'll pass
I'm not even going to bother it's from gun it will be dead within a year or less
It's about f**king time!!! 🎃🔪
Yessssss !!!!! I’ve been wanting this forever !!!!!
Btw I Would Say The Graphics Looks Like Dead By Day Light Or Friday The 13 Th Game that Made It Look Cool Can`t Wait🔥🔥🔥❤
First Hell raiser now Halloween 😮
Yes !!!! 👍
Finally !!!!!!!! Ive been waiting years for a game like this. Halloween is my absolute favorite horror movie. I’m so looking forward to this !!!!
Not going anywhere near anything GUN is involved with . They need to get the fuck out of the industry.
Please make a good Nightmare on Elm Street game!
Please, let this one survive! 😫
Finally🔥🔥🔥🔥
This looks & sounds awful lol…
First hellraiser and now this
Friday The 13th Texas Chainsaw Massacre Now Halloween
As long as it isn't another DBD clone, I'll be good.
Buying a gun game after texas ? Hell nah lmao
:000
Awesome!!!
Single player!? Praise the Lord!
Will I buy the game? Yes. Will i ever trust Gun. again? No.
ever since friday the 13th closed we've been getting classic killers for games for some reason
Nice looking good game
You cant kill the boogeyman? Haha let me just call up the  babayaga 😂😂
Take all my money, please , here you go it's yours. What's that? You want the house too, sold!
Thank god, single player. Please don’t FUCK it up!
RIP DBD contract?
Gun Interactive?!  I give it's less than a year.
I just have a feeling now he’s gonna get removed from dead by daylight thank God I already bought him
Day 1 buy
Milk the game for as much $ as possible then claim there is nothing else to do... That is GUN in a nutshell .
I can't wait to see how this one turns out with Halloween being turned into a Game FINALLY. So next year it's being released in 2026. This better be good. 🎮🎮🎯💀
Hey guys look! It’s another game for gun to shut down!
This is nice I must say but what we really need is a scream game 😅
Bet 😎🔥
GUN ruined Texas Chainsaw Massacre, never forget.
That trailer was weak AF
Took y’all long enough to get that we want SINGLE PLAYER GAMES that don’t become UNPLAYABLE and a waste of money after some time (Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, etc.)
Man, this oughta be a fun game.
Now, give us a Chucky game ❤
So, its the evil dead game
this looks fantastic!!
Alien Isolation but Halloween would be great
Actually insane to finally be able to play Halloween , I wish Friday the 13th had a bigger team and budget
You have no idea how bad i want this to work. With Friday 13th, one of the best asym horror games I've played, killer klowns, texas chainsaw massacre, all ending in a mess.  Unless you guys somehow lead me to believe this won't end up like those.. its a no from me. Sorry guys, fool me once, shame on you.. fool me FOUR times.. 😒
I thought this was for another movie reboot, thank goodness it's a game. Has real potential to be scary and fun if they dont botch it like some of the other games of the same genre.
Buying asap
Wow just wow🔥🔥🔥🔥
The voice reminds me of South Park’s Jeff Bezoz voice lol😊
Let's go we finally got old Haddeonfield back!
The gun logo was scarier than Micheal Myers
“A town just like yours” haha nice try I live in a large city in Canada (I’m so funny)
YESSSSSSSS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We really need a nightmare on elm street game that would be tight
>asymmetrical oh my god bruh
By Gun…. just dying to kill another franchise, eh? Already ripped through Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw… maybe this one will be good.
¿En este nuevo juego podremos jugar tanto como Michael Myers como el personaje que quiere escapar?
That’s a real, real bad Donald Pleasence imitation.
Please have Proxy chat 🙏
No actual gameplay footage.... so, how are going to make a whole game out of this?
I JUST HOPE ITS NOT A DEAD BY DAYLIGHT TYPE OF GAME
"I shot him 6× I shot him 6× I shot him in the heart I shot him 6×!!"  -Samuel Loomis.
That "Final Gameplay Footage Not Represented" disclaimer was smart because if I judged by what I saw in the trailer I'd have thought this was going to be bad.
Is this big head mode ??
THANK FUCK FOR SINGLE PLAYER HOLY SHIT. So many horror franchise have made the mistake of doing a multiplayer game instead of a single player one. Bout time they start learning.
I'll look forward to this game.
These devs have lost a lot of trust from players with what they did to TCM.  Also if you can’t do a good transatlantic accent, you should just speak normally.
Dude i feel like gun is just a money laundering operation at this point. They let 2 good games completely die out due to incompetence. And the playerbase for friday the 13th was dying long before the license issue. But hey at least they ignored player feedback for both games and pushed microtransactions until the games eventually died.
gun is going to kill her third license lmao
You can keep GTA 6 just take my money for this now!!!!
Voice over was like a South Park parody of Halloween
Lets hope gun dosnt butcher this one 🫩
Gun Media claims yet another horror IP. It’s over.
Man, I was hoping illfonic would go and make alien because of the show and new movie this year plus they did predator, but I bet this will be good still !
a remake of Halloween on the Atari 2600 was not on my bingo
It said single player and multi-player think it would be like that recent evil dead game
The 78 mask looks good
havent you bombed enough games?  F13: Was fire so that wasnt your fault  predator: trash  texas chainsaw: fun but became horrible  this? probably another failure unless its more like F13
Wtf is this sims?!?!  Its 2025!!!  Why is everything getting worse yet more expensive?!?!  STOP PAYING FOR CRAP!
Really interested in the Single Player mode.
Is this a real game ?
0:01 I wonder what that sound is.
Oooo this looks like a patreon budget game ngl
Samuel Lumis doing the narration was just perfect
Until next year??😮‍💨
Well this is gonna be dead within a year.
Watch it get abandoned like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre 😭
Yes!!!!!!
Oh, imagine if Donald Pleasance was still here
Nice, it has multiplayer
Sounds like Ewan McGregor voicing Dr.Loomis
I'd rather just a new character than a BAD Donald Pleasance impression.
So when are we gonna get a scream game?
cant waitttt
Another survivor sided game where no one wants to play as The Killer/Michael Myers lol  *Full Potential*
Oh awesome! Can't wait for Gun to dumpster this game too! RIP TCM.
Okay I’m excited.. but I’m usually let down with these kinds of things. Please do this beautifully.
Friday the 13th died, evil dead died, Texas chainsaw died, killers klowns died. Is this really going to be different?
LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOO
So basically gun. is gonna have us love this game for a year or 2 then absolutely kill the game and move on to the next horror franchise. (I’ll already know I’m still buying this lmao)
As a horror fan THANKYOU for finally making something single player
Single player? FINALLY
I hope it's not like dead by daylight .. They have M. Myers in that game but you couldn't play as him and is it a PC or console game
Yes, I was waiting for this a long, long time. Thank God now the real family begins next year. Thank you for the creators of this game.
The true horror would have been this being another game trying to be Dead By Daylight. Like Predator, Killer Klowns, Evil Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday The 13th... The list goes on.
Where's Ash when you need him, right?
It's a good trailer. But what the hell did they do with Donal Pleasance voice?! It just sounds so off. I know he's long gone, but it's just strange.
illfonic…. I’ll pass
NO WAY LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO9I9999O9O9OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OMG LETS FUCKING GO BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR EVER OMG LETS GO
Hope it’s not another dead by deadlight clone
Better be able to play both survivor and michael in single player, i dont want to rely on multiplayer to play as michael
Mike Myers before gta 6 lol
No thanks
Gun probably already stopped support for it.
Michael: [Happy breathing noises intensifies]
Laurie strode
This is gonna be the greatest game of all time
Wow this looks amazing!!!!
Awesome
Ohhhhhhhhh cannot wait for this!!!
Yesssssssss
Single player horror?! Let's go! About damn time!!
Again, and again ang again. Over and over and over and over. 😂
Hell No!! While F13 wasnt their fault, they abandoned Evil Dead, TCM and Killer Klowns. Stop pumping out new games with great IP just for money, just to give up on them. And if you do just pump them out...make them singleplayer (like the Hellraiser game) so that we don't have to worry about servers being shut down
I hope to hell this is good!
Its the guy from dbd🗣🔥
Brrrrooooooo whatttttttt so fucking stoked
We're getting a Michael Myers game before gta6
Oh this is about to be lit. The shivers of excitement I felt go down my spine.
As soon as I saw gun is involved there’s no hope for the game. They’ve killed both games they’ve been involved in and they’ll do the same to this one. Run it for a year and kill it. 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
NAHHH DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY GUN, GO LOOK HOW THE ABANDONED TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACARE AS SOON AS IT CAME OUT. DO NOT TRUST DO NOT PREORDER DO NOT BUY.
I gotta get this game 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 i knew this would come out
Since it has singleplayer im going to give Gun and illfonic a chance but if it dies im not buying another illfonic and gun game again
Ppl hatin Gun. Are babies they did friday very well and texas chainsaw, so im very hyped.
That fake Donald Pleasence voice is pretty bad.
Pretty sure Kane Hodder is doing the mocap
Here we go with Mike suddenly coming outta nowhere when you're hiding
FINALLY!!! Im glad single-player is mentioned... that'd the way horror games SHOULD be played.
1:31 that beat drop
So do we play as Michael or not? 😂
They really need to put all these games under one roof and one launcher and continue to polish them and add dlc
2 weeks max
YES!!!! A game about my favorite horror character!!! Dream come true
Is this gonna be like Friday the 13
That voice over and the animations in that scene looked/sounded horrible
Finally a Mike Myers game Groovy baby yeah!!
YESSS, I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS The FNAF chapter was such a huge disappointment, I haven't played DbD in what feels like months. Evil Dead was my favorite asymm, and TCM was okay but kinda slow-paced for my liking
There only one man you send to kill the fooking boogie man.
Estaria bueno que puedas usar tanto al asesino como a los civiles que deben escapar. Solo espero que sea muy terrorifico.
Annnnd its canceled and the servers are already shut down.
Hopefully, Gun interactive has learned from the mistakes of their previous 2 games: F13 and TCSM.
Omfg !!
They need to do nightmare on elm street.
Imagine if they had Jamie Lee in the game
If this game ends up like how Friday the 13th did imma be upset..
Finally a single player
What's up with all the horror  movie games.  Hellraiser, the new alien game. I'm sure I'm missing another one.
Oh.. produced by GUN... This game will die within a year of launch
Bro…just loop him around a pallet…
Aw heck yeah, finally a Halloween game that’s not stuck on a fifty year old console.
Good idea but make him more buff gng
Same people who made the chainsaw massacre game and the Friday the 13th game. Honestly guys this might flop.
I been waiting a Myers game. I loved f13.
Thank da lawd for single player. Seems like there is hope for the gaming industry after all.
Gun interactive, huge red flag.
Gun Interactive: Coming in 2026. Abandoned in 2025.
I CANT WAIT!!!
Fuhh Gun and Illfonic. 😊
Se ve como el orto😂😂😂 otro juego de mierda jaja
Ove been burned with jason and TCM. No thanks.
I wonder if this game be similar to how Friday The 13th played.
Let’s gooooooo!!!
God damn another movie IP that a multiplayer game. When will they ever learn
HELL YES!!!
Dopeeee
Please no didn't they learn by the Texas chainsaw massacre failure and evil dead as well
MULTIPLAYER NO WAY I CANT BELIEVE THIS IS A THING
2026 is wild 😭
The presentation here is perfect
Knew this is going to happen. ❤️
The irony is Jamie Lee Curtis is currently going viral. He must've sensed it
Just to get shutdown sometime later or stop dlcs or fixes as all the other games. Still excited tho but I know it’ll be short lived lol
As a Halloween fanatic, I resent the awful Donald Pleasance impression.
I've dreamt of a Halloween game for years!! However I'd rather a single player only experience akin to Alien Isolation with a stalker AI rather than another DBD-style game. However I will remain cautiously optimistic and reserve my judgement until the game is out!
Maybe these studios are realizing that we don't need to be a DBD clone to make a faithful adaptation to these horror movies.
Why does every horror game trailer use really goofy movements for their models.
They release this trailer on the same day I wear my favorite Michael Myers shirt.   Today is a good day.
Hell yeahhh
WE NEED TO HOLD GUN ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE BULLSHIT THEY PULLED WITH TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE!!! Scamming people of their money in the end only to let a nearly perfect horror game die. PLEASE OTHER STUDIOS KEEP THIS ONE ALIVEEEEEE! We also need a Scream game, asap.
pls dont make this another tcm
Why does this look like a late gen PS2 cutscene?
Best announcement so far
Didn't see this coming.
I LITERALLY JUST SAID I WANTED A SINGLE PLAYER HALLOWEEN🎃🍂 GAME!!!
The mask is too big
Holy shit this looks AMAZING!’ ARGHHHH 😂 So excited you guys!
With this and the hellraiser game i hope this is a classic horror Renaissance.These films are timeless.
Awesome!
Ilfonic & Gun, that's a Hell no from me(ex: Friday The 13th Game, Texas Chainsaw Massacre). You would be foolish to buy this game from them and trust these developers after those blunders.
I hope they all have an asymmetrical game mode that's just as good as Friday the 13th was. Man I miss that game. Was my favorite horror game until the damn law suit had to ruin it.
They main people thats already complaining are gonna be the first ones buying it like shut up 😂
I told my wife she is getting this game
I’m guessing the license is gonna last a month and then they are gonna everything in their power to erase it from the internet. Another garbage TCM situation.
Lets GO
Вышел трейлер к Восставшим из ада и я спустя время мечтал чтобы вышел трейлер по Хеллоуин, мечты сбываются. Пойду за Майкла каточку наверну в DBD
Please God let this game succeed because this would be fuckin awesome.
The true horror of this trailer was seeing the gun interactive logo at the end.
Watch gun let go of this game too like tcm😂
No way this is gonna be so badass 😍
I absolutely cannot wait to play this game.  Waited my whole life to play a myers game. However, did anyone else think michael head and shoulder appear odd. Small shoulders or bigger head???
Wish they could've did their own spin on the halloween story instead of the multi-player aspect I don't trust them at ALL
That doesn't sound like me
make him a bit wider please
Unfortunately Gun Media will destroy
Finally....a Halloween horror game for everyone
Assuming no official release date yet? Can’t wait to try it out
Illfonic?  Hopefully it doesn't die out after 6 months..  Hope there's single ans multi player
Seeing the phrase single player in todays age, no matter what the game, is always a great feeling. I wouldn't have cared about this, but now I do.
Okay first a genuinely good-looking Hellraiser game and now this??? Heck yeah about time!!!!
Reminds me of the Friday the 13th game. Same mid animation and rigging. Hopefully, it's actually good since I'm starving for a good classic horror game. Friday was a mess. But the fact this has single player does at least give me some hope. So tired of literally every "horror" game just being a Dead by Daylight clone. So boring. Maybe one day we can get a game like FEAR again too.
WE. DO. NOT. NEED. MORE. DBD. CLONES
I've waited for a Halloween game my *entire* life 🔥
Hahahaa that animation was SO janky though... specially the woman running 😂😂😂
The sad part about games like these is they dont last long due to ip and the fact that solo killer games cant do much variety thats why even tho dbd is the same each match gameplqy wise all the diffrent perks and killers keep it going i dont see this game lasting long sadly and at least Michael is still in dbd unlike pinhead getting a new game and hes been removed
This better be on all platforms 🤩🤩🤩
dead before arrival or a month. cause big streamers will cause it to trend. forgot to say think hellraiser is the only one to not do a dead by daylight copy.
Oh thank heavens it's not a DBD clone
What you can do is walk in a straight line. Michael Myers only weakness is  ‘Power walking’.
Axe murderers, we don't die Serial killers, we don't die Freaks of the night, we don't die We get high, we don't die
Play as Myers while playing my HORROCORE MUSIC! AXE MUREDERS ,WE DONT DIE! SERIAL KILLAHS WE DONT DIE! WE GET HIGH! WE DONT DIE!
Gun? Major fucking oof. They can go fuck themselves after the whole TCM fiasco.
My hopes for this dropped like a rock when I saw Illfonic and GUN. IDK how those clowns are still in business with the terrible games they make.
already doomed to fail, gun media and illfonic
please don't be a 1v4 DBD clone. Please be like Hitman but you play as Micheal. EDIT: I am getting so tired of EVERY horror IP game needing to be Dead by Daylight. GET A NEW SCHTICK YOU HACK FRAUDS. Almost 100% sure that the "single player experience" is gonna just be the PVP mode with shitty AI just like EVERY OTHER ISOMETRIC 1v4 HORROR GAME ON THE FUCKIN MARKET.
I want the single player to where you dont just play as Michael but I want to play as the victim. I want to feel the fear of him after me. I wish the F13 game had that feature and not just during multiplayer
holy shittttttt
Another asym by Gun that gets abandoned after one year... you'll see ._. Also, those animations.... yikes.
Good thing they got his mask correct cause dead by daylight did a HORRIBLE JOB
i really hope this can be as good as f13. that game was probably the most fun i had with an asym
Thank god, between this and Hellraiser here's to hoping DBD dies
I SWEAR TO FUCKING GOOD THEY BETTER NOT FUCK THIS UP
Welp. So much for multiplayer retirement 😂
Wow what a terrible voice impersonation
Michael is the king of Slashers
This voice trying to be Dr. Lumis is not great lol
No amount of words can't describe of the I love I have for  Halloween with the character of Michael Myers and how excited I am for this game single and multiplayer let's go:)
Servers will shut down 2 years after launch 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hellraiser now Halloween wow.
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO
Really hope there will be evil within 3 sound from dbd somewhere
I’m gonna shoot him six times.
Damned right, *single player* !
Would be nice if they made the game like the whole series except for Halloween 3 lol.
GUN? Stay the hell away from this game
1 year at max
Quite possibly the worst voice over I’ve ever heard.
i wonder what the "single player" experience entails. do they mean bot lobbies? or is it going to have a story mode?
Oh fuck. Illfonic?!?! Yeah this games already dead
He came home 🏡 🎃
Hell yeah!!!!!
From the 1st second of the video I'm hooked. That opening music just hits.
I'm glad malak akkad is helping bring this in his father's name  Just so you all know, malak akkad is the son of moustapha akkad who was the producer or executive producer of the Halloween films up to Halloween resurrection and basically took over the franchise after John Carpenter left following Halloween 2
God can they stop making Asym horror games. It’s guaranteed death. DBD will kill all of them because the community thinks it’s a competition and always puts DBD above and let’s the others die
Can't wait to see Illfonic and Gunmedia absolutely half ass and abandon this game after they've already made a pretty penny off of all us idiots that don't learn give them money.  They literally do this over and over and over and over and over again and it works every, single, time.
omg the guy from dbd
Should have known those scumbags at gun would get there dirty hands on halloween eventually. I ain't buying this garbage
I’m definitely going to take it for a spin
Best decision ever made.
So will we be able to play as Micheal?
I hope this game doesnt involve generators.
Take my d*** money... Been waiting for something FOR YEARS!!!!!
How does gun keep getting work? They only just stopped dancing on TCM dead body and now they have halloween in their grubby mits is astonishing.
This game from the footage from it just makes me wet I'm a huge Halloween fan and I was sad when they got rid of the Friday 13th service game or whatever it was I hope this is kind of like it but in its own unique way anyways anyone else excited
"Co-published by Gun Interactive" well... fuck.
Can illfonic and gun media leave games like this alone and let a different better company make it
Gun plss keep the game alive till Halloween Kills timeline update just throwin out games to abandon😩
Hopefully single player means we get to play as Michael.
You can’t be serious!? Gun?? Stop hiring those cucks! I give the game a year before they shut it down
Yesssss! Heck yeah baby omg... finally!
It’s about time we got a Michael Myers game
My spirit animal getting his time to shine
That's one of the worst voice overs I've ever heard
LFGOOOOO
Excluding the flat narration, trailer is perfect
Friday the 13th game should've had single player, they really blew that one.
That is a piss poor loomis impersonation.  Hopefully they do better on release.
This looks really bad. The graphics on this... whatever this is... looks bad. The animations look bad. That Donald Pleasance impression is really bad (AI or whatever you had done... is bad). It's good that you're doing a single player something here because so many games now ignore that, but with how bad this showing is I fully expect it to be completely inane content wise. But this is only because I have no faith in games developers that want to do an early showing of their game that looks this bad after 40+ years of seeing video games. I am fully opened to you making a good game and proving me wrong.
Im sold
F I N A L L Y
When Friday XIII came out, I was there. When Texas Chainsaw Massacre came out, I was there. When Killer Klowns from Outer Space came out, I was there. And now Halloween is upon is, and I will say the same thing for this as I did every other asym horror game that has come out. PLEASE actually support this game so it lasts longer than a year </3
Ok so we got thing and now Halloween when are we going to get a escape from new York game or a snake plissken game and have Kurt Russell do the voice
Gun's making this? I give it a week.
Genuinely one of the worst voiceovers I've ever heard. It's some 20 year old guy in a closet recording the lines. He's probably never acted before.
I dont care sign me up ! wanted this for years ! Friday was good for its time , not huge on the Texas game but Love Predator Hunting grounds ! I hope they do a decent campaign , i dont expect it to be longer than 3 hours but a fun little campaign. as for multiplayer ? I hope it Friday The 13th on roids but well polished ! dont fuck this up Illfonic this is my favourite Horror series! Long Live Micheal Myers and long live Halloween !
oh, I'm definitely playing this!!! Let's go Michael!
If done right this could be great
Omg this looks so good!!
I’m Hoping it’s a cinematic story driven game like alien but probably not
What if Micheal Myers was in Freaker Friday
Chills watching this. Been asking for this game since I was a kid. Can’t wait!
Unfortunately this game is going to be terrible, really wish devs would have more creativity than this, we already have DBD we don't need another.
Animations look so stiff
26 is going to be an epic year, we get GTA 6 and a Halloween video game.
If you don't already know this game dev's track record you should do a little research and not get too excited. Gun is pretty infamous for being incredibly arrogant, up their own ass, and will not care about scamming you.
They’re finally learning. Licensed single player horror games would go over really well. All we’ve had for years are just Dead By Daylight clones. Hellraiser and Halloween kicking it off right.
Are you playing as micheal or a victim?
I’m a grown ass man, I don’t want a damn video game. Make another movie.
👇Petition to remove Gun.
A genuine Halloween game? Hallelujah!
Angry Video Game Nerd: They're making another one?
What do they mean by single player and multiplayer? Will it have an actual campaign with a separate multiplayer mode or is it just that you can play the multiplayer mode by yourself? I would prefer the first option. I’m tired of multiplayer horror games.
Por fin.....
Lmao this looks goofy as fuck
LET'S FUCKIN' GOOOOO!!!
Be very good in VR
Sam Loomis: “……you can’t kill him…..”   9mm, 45 acp, and 12 gauge Buck shot: “Hold my beer"
YESSS FKN Hellraiser now this!!!
Looks good Michael looks like a hillbilly tho
Another illfonic asymmetrical game that will die in 3 months.... yay....
ILLFONIC NOOOOOO!!!
Is this going to be like the Friday the 13th game?
As a Michael Myers fan, this is going to rock! May the campaign thrive! 🔪
Donald Pleasence suffered in the making of this tailer..... really? there was no one better? or just use his own recorded voice over? sorry but it throws me off of the trailer itself. single player eh? good thinking ahead, hope Jason's fate doesn't await Michael
THIS LOOKS INSANE 🔥
It’s already on the verge of ending development with gun involved
How are we the player contrlling myers supposed to catch up with the survivers when myers doesn't run
I don't like the graphics at all, the FPS dud, it looks weird, not sure about the audio, the animations are- *Singleplayer and multi-*  SINGLE PLAYER (!!!!!!) :0000
Gun Media, the LJN of this generation.
A yes can’t wait to have another Friday 13th and Chainsaw situation
Oh goodie GUN media again….so the game will be dead within 5 months
inb4 this game gets shut down in 2028
Dope!  Michael Rules!
I hope it’s not like texas chainsaws multiplayer cos that shi was ass
REMEMBER WHAT  GUN INTERACTIVE  DID TO TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE !!!!!!!
HECK YESSS SINGLE PLAYER THIS IS EXCITING!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASEEEE BE GOOD! The voice over is a little concerning I’ll say that but the cinematic is dope.
Ok I’m sold
AVOID THIS GAME. DO NOT GIVE GUN INTERACTIVE ANY MONEY, THEY'VE ALREADY BUTCHERED TWO LICENSES
Illfonic? Fuck, the game is going to be JUST like F13 or PHG. Fun for the first week or two then die off extremely fast with only diehard fans staying after that, dwindling even further due to toxicity in the community. Hopefully it goes more F13 than PHG with its monetization/DLC.
I was really hoping it was gonna come out this October but we have to wait until 2026 seriously man I'm waiting for soo many tv shows,movies and video games predator badlands,stranger things,deltarune chapter 5, gta 6 and this and since it says 2026 it's probably coming out October 2026 to market it. the pain man i just gotta survive please god let me live. 🙏 😭😭😭
woww
Illfonic and gun….oh yeah this game is shutting down 2 years later
evil comes back tonight❤❤❤
Good work guys. Can't wait for next year to hear you delivered a fully "complete" game, refuse to update it, then shut the servers down.
Hopefully we get an alien isolation like single player game.
Cursed devs lol
AHHHHHHHHHHHH RAhhhhhhhhhhhh
Why did it take so long. I’m so fucking tired of everything being dead by daylight like someone else said. We deserve single player story driven AAA experiences for all horror titles!
People keeping hope that this won't be like Friday is hilarious. It's the same fucking studio you dunces
What console?
not very excited. bad VO aside, this is the game I've dreamed of since I was a kid and I really hope the gameplay looks better than this trailer
Ugh why cant it be just single-player
finally! i been waiting for this game since i was a kid haha
I already know how beat the game just wait till the game is really old then you kill him in the most lame slowest way ever and then end the game cough cough new Halloween movie
The single player element should be more than just playing offline. It needs to feature full set pieces from every film that can be played out, from both perspectives, similar to what Alien Isolation did with its DLC. Or maybe feature an original story, maybe it can cover the full time between Michael being shot by Loomis before getting apprehended by the cops. But since this is being done by Gun Media, I doubt we'll see that happen... If it's more than twenty bucks and if we don't see an improvement to their work, I may pass on this. It's a shame, because I love Halloween and John Carpenter, but they partnered with some of the worst talent this genre has to offer.
I got hyped when i read that it's the same dev from F13 but Gun as co-publisher? no thanks i'll pass.
Hopefully this doesnt end like friday the 13th game
Regardless on how the final game turns out, this is a cool fucking trailer.
The same people who did killer clowns? I’ll pass 😂
I would like to see a original story mode for single player
Is this a new dead by daylight dlc??
How do we really know michael doesnt have emotion? Maybe the problem was that loomis was just a shitty psychiatrist.
I thought this is another reboot film.  I was going to barf, not another reboot.  But is cool now.
That Loomis voice is absolutely atrocious.
I'm surprised no one has taken Halloween or jason ect and done an until dawn style of game with em
GUN MEDIA? HELL NAH, i was excited until i see this name again, can't wait to see the new overpriced things that will come, and for sure, 6 months updates do fix 1 bug and create another 10
As bad as the characters looked, I dont care. Ill still give it a spin regardless
Welcome back friday the 13th 2
A Hellraiser game and a Halloween game..Let's go!
After how Gun treated TCM, no thanks.
Just like Friday the 13th in Texas Chainsaw Massacre , I'll love it , I'll put  hundreds of hours into it and then I'll be disappointed when they kill it in between the 18-24 month period.
The Loomis sounds horrible. Sorry.
Pass if gun is tied to this. After what you did to TCM harrrrrrd pass.
Cool
Single player is what I like to hear
Will they release physical copies or is this going to be purely digital
YESSSSSS JOHN THANK YOU FOR BEING OUR SAVIOR FOR THIS HORROR GAME! IM SO EXCITED!!!
That Loomis impersonation though. 😂
Let’s go
I'm glad it's a single player game but why did they have to say you can play multiplayer too have they not learned their lesson with Friday the 13th video game this should be just a single player if not a co-op
🔥🔥🔥
Who up Michaeling they Meyers
FINALLY!!!!!
Here we go again. How long will you be able to play it before Gun pulls the plug like TCM and F13?
Gun devs are so lazy they give up on friday 13 and texas don't suport this game
Oh god.. Michael with a updated version of the alien isolation aliens ai would be terrifying
Looks promising. Hopefully the next preview will use the old movie trailer voice over
Yesssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Looks fire
This voice acting sucks 😂
Ok. Now I'm excited for Halloween. Between this and phasmophobia I'm all set.
Bro I *LOVED* Friday the 13th, but the game just died off.. and now that the servers shut down it's just rough.   Proximity Chat, locking doors, hiding.. all of it was so damn good.
Stay away from Gun Media
We're finally going to play as Michael Myers for this game
Thought this was fake 1:48  saw it on fb and sheeesh 😮
Illfonic and Gun this game is already doomed to fail. 😭
A pinhead game and a Michael game? Say less
Im excited for this game.....but if illfonic has unfortunately taught me anything, i can 100% bet this games getting taken offline and losing support within 3 or so years  after release.
Gotta up the animation budget, for real
Better be multi-player too or it'll be a waste of money. And I doubt a lot of people will buy it because of how they treated TCM players
Gun studios? *benzino voice* cmonn mannn
"He's gonna get you! He's gonna get you! The boogie man is coming!"
yessssssss 🤘🏽🤘🏽
Please come to Switch 2 please come to Switch 2! 🙏🏼
Enfin un vrai jeu Halloween!!!!!
Hell yeah Illfonic and Gun this will surely be a dead release within a year and all them DLCs well you seen what happened to Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw. 20 dollar skins, missed release dates  3 months passed expectation and probably some legality bullshit. These guys are best known for taking money and sitting on their asses in  office watching horror movies brainstorming ideas that never come to light.
Going to skip this one. I was hoping for an actual story line game, games in this format (not sure what the format is called) get so boring, so fast, and other than the IP changes, are all exactly like each other.
Oh hell yeah
After what happened with TCM I think I'll pass.
Better be 5v1
Fingers crossed it's half as good as F13. They did ok on Predator amd killer clowns but please do not let GUN anywhere near this thing
HOLY FUCK WE HAVE SINGLE PLAYER
Who else is here for the original theme song 👍😭
That person trying to envoke Donald Pleasance is 👎
Hell yes I'm going to pre order this
Can i play as mike myers the comedian?... And as Mike Mike? (matan even's sidekick)
yes!!
thank god for a single player... otherwise the servers will be turned off after 6 months
This looks great ❤
How about blowing his Fing head off
I swear the mask and just how he never ran after anyone, alone just scared me when i was a kid. Just silently walking towards you and even if you managed to escape he somehow still manages to get ahead of you or ambush you
Didn’t they learn from Friday the 13
Well lets see if you have to run from him or if you play as him in single player
Oh no, it's The devs of friday the 13th and tcm, they will grab the money and abandon the game again
Take my money and leave me alone
The one thing I ask for this game is please don't let gun interactive ruin it or desert it completely like texas chainsaw. Single player and multiplayer sounds like an interesting idea for a Micheal Myers game, so please don't ruin it.
they couldn't even get the original dialogue right this is what is actually said I met this 6 year old child with this blank Pale emotionless face the blackest of eyes the Devils eyes like come on if your going to make a game about Michael Myers the original Halloween movie you have to use the same exact spoken dialogue from the movie otherwise it sounds Goofy
Friday the 13th needs to return better
Looks like it was made 15 years ago.
Gun and Illfonic are making another horror game? 3rd time’s the charm. I love TCM and KKFOS but the only love they were given post launch were mostly cosmetics, only TCM got a few new characters. (This obviously doesn’t need multiple characters, it’s just Michael) Also, by multiplayer and single player do they mean how Friday the 13th had multiplayer with small single player challenges?
I don’t care if it has bugs im grinding that multiplayer
single player is what I'm excited for
Single player, finally! Im glad they’re giving some legs to the game finally. All these horror games are just dead after they stop receiving support, finally something for the people who don’t care for multiplayer, and something that won’t get shut down and become unplayable in a few years.
Thank you for making this single player THANK YOU!
Illfonic keeps getting these famous IPs that gets canned quickly.
BOYCOTT GUN MEDIA
I want it but Gun is involved. He literally gave up on Tcm & F13. So honestly I’m already disappointed and don’t have high hopes.
Why do they keep getting these ip when the fuck up every one and then drop support for it shortly after
They did a sloppy job with Dr. Loomis's voiceover. It sounds like they hired random British voice actor to record the dialogue and then synthesize  it through an ai program with a Donald Pleasence voice model to make it sound more  like Dr. Loomis, which they failed miserably.  Or they might've used Elevenlabs.
Big Mike is back baby
Is it me or is the voice over sound like its AI generated? It sounds so off to me for some reason.
I am not even a gamer, but I will play this game 🎮🎃
Bruh you literally announced that while I'm wearing a Michael Myers shirt.  I cannot make this up 😂
I'm so happy right now
Is there a multiplayer option?
Please be like Friday the 13th
John Carpenter on this is the only reason I have hope for this, after what happened with TCM, I don't have much faith in Gun to handle community feedback...
Third game you morons have made thats the same exact game just reskins, FT13th got ruined, from what ive heard chainsaw is already done..and now this.
Yes Sir O.G killer in gaming form🖖
What is it with IllFonic and running animations
no rick , no raff , no chrome , no dior , no preme , no yeezy , no balenci ,no prada , no vetiments , no bape , no trues , no vercace ,
I hope this game doesn't suffer the same fate Friday the 13th did because this game looks good
I swear to god if this is just another asym... Also the guy playing Loomis here sounds nothing like him
Thank God for single player. So sick and tired of games being catered to streamers
Their about to remove Michael Myers from dead by daylight, aren’t they?
When has Michael ever walked swaying side to side? Little nitpick.
Gun Interactive...  not buying. Dogsh1t companies. Sell Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you butchered all of your games.Why would I ever want to buy another one?
Animation looks jank
This looks.... not good
dont abandon this game too
BOYCOTT GUN INTERACTIVE
Will it reach its full potential after year 1 of release?
HELL YES! I’ve wanted to walk around that town forever.
Oh boy! Another asymmetrical horror that'll last all of one year, YIPPY!
No one will dethrone DBD.
I hope you can play as Michael and it has all the difference masks and stuff.
S houldve waited to announce next year. Got me all hype for this halloween 2025 for nothing. Get outta here with that!
Take my money already.
The words “single player” made me sooooo happy
OH MY GOD YESYS IM COMING
They are starting to get it. These games need a singleplayer option as well.
Excited for this, just hope gameplay don't let it down.
Just don't let this one fall like F13 did
If the single player is just a warm-up for online matches, that’s a huge missed opportunity.
I’m excited for this game but the downside about it it’s by gun. They will kill this game in 4 months after release and it will suffer the same fate as Texas chainsaw massacre.
Ahhh yes, singleplayer. I can sleep peacefully 😌
Gun 💀 oh no.. It’s going to happen again, the third horror IP those useless people have to ruin and shut down the game after a year.
this looks and sounds bad
Can we all agree that if this game dies as well we take away Gun's right to make asymmetrical horror games. RIP TCM
So what is this just a remake of the Atari 2600 game?
a fucking single player halloween game?!! omfggg🤤🤤
That theme song will never get old. It's so iconic, too. It'll never stop playing for every generation.
Considering Gun Media seem to be part of this... I genuinely hope it does well this time.
Micheal seems a little off.. looks like a little kid with a myers mask on. Maybe needs to be a bit taller.
Glad to see illffonic got another one
Alright Gun/Illfonic, don't screw this up like ya did Friday, I'm hoping y'all have learned a lot since then, high hopes.
Man, you really don’t know what an outstanding job good voice actors do until you hear one this bad.
I can't wait for the developers to decide to stop supporting the game after a year for no reason.
At first I thought it’s a movie😂
I like Michael Myers, I like the Halloween franchise (not all movies for sure) I like playing Myers in Dead by Daylight. But what the hell is this?  This is ugly AF!  This is next gen graphics, really? Telling me this is a mobile game please.  The motion captures is sucks, this skinny Miyers look  like a random NPC. OMG, this is terrible! 👎🏾
He was doing very well last night
I sure hope GUN has nothing to do with this game 🥀
Almost lost me when it showed the logo for G4n. Just barely won me back when it said single player at the end. Gonna hold off on buying until I know it’s gonna be better than the TCM and Friday the 13th game though
They shouldve made him bigger with broader shoulders but other than that, im excited !
The goat finally getting a game
These games have to stop. All they do is monopolize on horror franchises. They last a hot minute and people stop playing them.
Very cool but why does Michael Myers have small body and big head the mask looks weird looking to and needs to be fixed but at the same time looks pretty awesome it has the tone look and the music
For the god sake ! Finally solo game thank illfonic and gun media for that , too much multiplayer game in 2025
Thank you for making it a single player game too! We really appreciate it ❤
As someone who spent 100s of hours on Friday the 13th i have faith in gun but they need to do better then Texas chainsaw for sure always wanted them to do a Halloween game.
IM SO SO SO HAPPY THIS HAS FINALLY BEEN CONFIRMED!!!!! IM SO EXCITED!!!!😁😁😁😁😁🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪
That animation and voice over is atrocious
They can literally take my money I am a huge fan of Michael Myers🔥🔥🔥
Wow, at last a proper Halloween game, can't wait for this
COÑO DE MI MADRE NO JODA
Man that voice over was bad.
Is it gonna be on xbox??
Is this a Remake of the Atari 2600 game?
I hope this game is better than the last movie.
oh great another game for gun to abandon after a year.
I hope there’s a story
FINALLY
They should stop make horror game every game flopped what happened to the game of clowns and the game Texas chainsaw it flopped
Oh look another game gun media/ illfonic going to fail
Why his shoulders so narrow though?
Is this AI? Looks cheap af
Man i wish they actually just show gameplay instead of just cinematic trailers we want to see gameplay..
Gun and Illfonic singlehandedly ruining my childhood with each passing video game.  Thanks guys! 🫡
We should be able choose to play as Micheal Myers escaping the mental hospital trying to get to his sister or Loomis looking for clues trying to track Micheal down.. the game should start the moment Loomis drives up to the hospital and sees all the patients in the field, then you decide to play as either Loomis or Micheal
About time we get a Halloween themed Horror game!
I enjoyed the Friday the 13th game. It's interesting to see this announcement shortly after the hellriser trailer too
FINALLY!!!!!!!!
Hellraiser and then this??? us horror movie fans are eating good
Jason is better
I better get to be Michael Myers for single player mode.
Oh I'm absolutely buying this Halloween game in 2026 on my ps5 now that i know it has a single player mode for it
Lol that looks like garbage
Micheal myers sucks
Please make Nightmare On Elm Street game like with different stages. I know there was an NES game back around 1990…..
The mask is so big holy hell
Shitty graphics and gun is attached. Atleast there better be a single player mode that’s worth playing. And Atleast we have a Halloween game. But this looks bad
You lost me at "illfonic" and "Gun." Look at what they did to Killer Klowns and TCM.
Move over Friday the 13th fans, it's OUR turn to be disappointed by a new project
Don't worry, 6 months after release it will stop receiving support from Gun and Illfonic if we go off of TCM and Killer Klowns. Literally the two developers I was really hoping wouldn't get this license after seeing what happened with TCM and Killer Klowns, I will be surprised if they support this game longer than those. At least Friday was more of a legal issue
Need this!
If that is supposed to be dr. loomis voice then its awful lol Also, I highly doubt this halloween game can compete with the atari 2600 version! No chance in hell of that happening
MICHAEL AUDREY MYERS THE ABSOLUTE GOD OF ALL SLASHERS IS GETTING HIS FIRST OFFICIAL STAND-ALONE VIDEOGAME SINCE 1983!!!!
First Jason, second Leatherface and nos Michael Myers..... No gun. plssss
CANT WAIT omg
Pls don't be yet another asimetric multiplayer game, so many nice horror IP's end up just trying to emulate Dead by Deadlight, I can count at least 3 or 4, Friday the 13th, Killer Clowns from Outer Space, Evil Dead and possibly Hellraiser?
Nah Jason be Michael will feeds family’s 🔥😝
Please be 3rd person...
Wouldn’t it be funny if it came out in on November first
We have a Halloween base Michael Myers game before GTA 6
❤
This gives me killer klown vibes and Jason gameplay
Friday the 13th: The Game was abandoned by the developers, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre game is practically abandoned too. And now, yet another game to buy and have it abandoned in less than a year. You know what these three games have in common? They’re from the same developers. I’m NOT buying!
A HALLOWEEN GAME!!!!!!!? NO WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😯😯😯😲😲😲😲😲.
Cut the fucking shit with the asymmetric horror games. Make a fucking single player story based game. Thank god the upcoming Hellraiser game is a story based game.
Can we get a Halloween III DLC plz
Is this going to be a multiplayer game or a single player game
Oh wow! A famous ip being made into a game that's developed by illfoniC! Im sure this'lL be the game they do that's a long-lasting, fUn expErience, gets constant heaLthy support based on player fEedback with no unreSolved bugs, and no pay to win microtranSactions! 😃
Nah, gun media can screw themselves after they reached their "full potential" on tcm.
First a Hellraiser game, now a Halloween game. 🔥🔥🔥
Yeah we all know what kind of game this is going to be but ima buy it anyway, then a month later never play it again
SXREAMING HAPPY CAUSE OF SINGLE PLAYER
The night he came home 🎃
If it’s like Friday the 13th, I’m all about it!
Damn you guys complain so much nothing and I mean nothing pleases you guys if you don’t like the voice or the game why comment
Michael Myers finally gets his own game. Nothing fanmade or a tech demo by one person. No an actual game that's both single and multi-player. As a fan of this series since I was 13 I'm looking forward to this.
Man idk this is cool af but what they did to f13 the game and Tcm how can we trust this 🤔 🤨 also they better bring this to the Nintendo switch 2 don’t see why it’s not listed 😮‍💨
FINALLYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!
Please, don't suck. Please don't suck.
Ooommmggggg I've been waiting for this!!!
This game is for the people who had F13 game taken away from them
I loved f13ths multiplayer nothing can match it I still play camp forest green can't wait for this to drop
So the killer clowns, Friday the 13th style?
Story mode games, especially this generation don’t really last long anymore. Once you beat a game that’s it. Online games  get more content updates wich is what really goes into versions of a game more than anything especially when your battling other online players to make it more interesting. And out of all story about games I feel like horror story games. I really last that long only online games do really. Look at the success of dbd . As much as I hate dbd , look at many years that games been around and people still play that game the death  as it’s just an online horror game. The Friday the 13th video game would have lasted just as long as the success like dbd if they didn’t give themselves into lawsuit troubles to where they had to stop supporting content for the game for it to then die sadly . Story mode horror games don’t seem to last that long to keep people interested in playing it for so long compared to online horror games
Ugh. Gun Media 🤮
Thank heavens for single player inclusion. Better be good!
This is a joke right?
Animations look trash
7 seconds in and it's already a deal breaker because Gun is apart of it. They abandon their games and treat their customers like crap.
If this game has anything to do with Gun and its developers i'm skipping it.
Finally !!!a dream come true !!! Whoever idea was  to finally make a Myers  game ...THANK YOU!!
I love Halloween, but personally, I love Halloween just a little more than Halloween.
The dbd killer
Oh would you look at that, single player.
Holy shit.
É, ta bom......
What's that Loomis voice though 😭
Pre order?
Now we are waiting when the Halloween chapter will not be possible to buy in Dead by Daylight
there goes another dbd license
OH MY GOD NOOOOOO WAY I’ve been wanting this for I don’t know how longggggggggggg, I don’t care about gta6 or whatever else is coming out this is for sure my most anticipated game of 2026
So he’s leaving dbd
I wouldn’t trust anything gun is involved with!
After TCM, I’m done. Should’ve been done after f13th but, nah. Asymmetrical games are something that are not in my “to buy” list anymore.
They should have had the terrifier game like this or the Friday the 13th game
That's the shittest Dr Loomis impression I've ever heard
Mayelo Clementino got a videogame!! 🔥🔥
this the same company that argued with ppl on reddit and gave up on tcm lets not forget 💀
Pass.
What i wish Friday the 13th game would be. Singe player
Yoooooo 😱 🔥🔥🔥
Please be good!!! I havent been this excited about a game for over 10 years now! The Gamer in me is screaming for this to be glorious!!! Lol
Please for the love of god do not make this game be like Texas Chainsaw or Dead By Daylight. Please let it be like Friday The 13th the game 😩
Don't buy this game you will get scam since there is Gun Media on it save your money people !
And we're sure it won't be cancelled like the millions of other games these days?
old haddonfield
Open world killing spree?
It’s about freakin time! Thx u!!!
great... guns got it's fingers in it...  I have low hopes..
It’s illfonic so be prepared for minimal support and it to just be another 1v4 game with light single player elements
It's coming!! Finally, I remember reading about it a few years ago.
I hope the Singleplayer Mode is significant, because it sucks that every horror IP finally getting a game is just ending up being an Asymmetric Game. If we can get a solid Singleplayer Story, then the Online is what keeps the game fresh that'd be cool. Hopefully the new Jason Game doesn't just end up being a new Asymmetric Game when it gets revealed(I'd be fine with another one, but we need something else first).
Finally!! A HALLOWEEN GAME UGH
Wankers🎉🎉🎉
Hope they have different skins for Michael
That narrator is ass but everything else seems alright
MY BOY MIKE
This is cool Michael Myers is back 🧡🖤🔪🎃😊
Ahh man 2026??
game looks like it's from 2010 throw it in the trash
Took them this long to make a game
Oh thank God Single player mode. It better not just be like 1/4 of the game and be more than half of it we need a good single player horror movie game
God sakes man I thought this was a movie don’t ask why, but happy for a game,
FINALLY!!! A Halloween Game after soooo long bro!!!! 😭
Ayyyyyy
IllFonic and GUN Studio? This game will be a mess parade /short support like they did with KKFOS and Texas ChainSaw. 👎👎👎
Please don't let this game flop! This looks very good
Yesss! Micheal Myers is my favorite serial killer . Finally he’s getting he’s own video game . I hope it plays the same way as the Friday the 13th game did with the same escape concepts and vibe it gave off and everything. That game was golden in its prime before the lawsuit stuff happened. It will be cool in this new Michael Myers game that you could play as any version of Michael Myers from all the different movies that ever came out with  getting to pick from all the different masks and jumpsuits kinda like how they did that with Jason in his own game
OMGOMG im so excited this is going to be peak
You know the shape in dbd is gonna get an uptick in players cause of this trailer
They should've gone the hellraiser revival route
Here's hoping the single player is an actual campaign and not just the multiplayer but with bots.
Can't wait for Gun and Ilfonic to invetivabley mess this up, like they did with TCM and Predator.
Single player let's gooooooo
Probably gonna get this game before GTA6 too! Awesome!
I loved friday the 13th. I can't wait for this.
All good will and hype with Gun died with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre game
It's probably some stupid Dead by Daylight title. If it is, then lame.
music to my ears
If this is just the Friday the 13th game with a new skin, I AM SO THERE FOR IT!!!! 😁😁😁
"asymmetric stealth horror" So it's a DBD clone. With the option to play with bots in SP.  Lame. Why do they do this? Cause it worked out so well for Evil Dead and Friday the 13th? Or the overwhelming success of Killer Klowns? Or maybe it was the F2P Puppet Master game that everyone has for sure heard of. Just make a single player horror game! No server costs, no constant updating, follow the story of the first 2 movies, 10-15 hours of gameplay, release it at Halloween. 30-40 dollar price tag. Boom. Make your money and walk away.
Michael saw the Freaky Friday promos
Two months before the day itself. He's back.
I’ve been wanting a modern Halloween game for the longest time. I’m really looking forward to this!!
1:31 that theme gets me hyped everytime 🔥
Lets hope this one lasts more than 3 years this time
Who is ready for some half-asses patches that break then game? 😂 if ya’ll know Gun’s history…..
Oh heck yeah! 🔥
Michael Myers will be voiced by Pedro Pascal
pre game dying within 2 years cause of gun 💀
oh gun interactive dont fuck this up
LETS GOOOOO
I KNEW IT👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🔥
I hope it’s a single player  similar to the Until Dawn one.
😮
Please don’t let this end up like f13…
everyone's getting on the train hellraiser is driving huh?
You can't kill boogeyman, yes "So John isn't exactly a boogeyman he is the man you sent to kill a fuckin boogeyman" 😂, well i think it should be interesting product.
Hyped for this 🔥🔥 plz gun don’t ruin this
Bruh im watching the latest trilogyand this trailer came out
first hellraiser and now halloween? thats awesome
they killed friday the 13, they dropped the ball on the predator game, and they ruined the texas chainsaw massacre game; sure why not give gun another ip to bastardize
>GUN Media  Nah, I'm good.
Helllll yea!!!!!!!!!! Finalyyyyy!!!!
Welp, I love the idea. I just don't know how they'll execute it. 🤷🏾
I’m so grateful, so hyped!        Thank you all involved in making this HALLOWEEN game possible.
He looks... skinny for some reason
Not sure if I'm sold on this game yet......
Gun is envolved... I'm not touching the game
His head looks a bit big
F Gun media, do not support anything they make
Well ... I mean ... the Hellraiser game looks pretty good!
I love Halloween and Myers, but I got no idea how they're turning it into a good and faithful singleplayer game
We're getting this before Billie Bust Up?
This better not be a freaking Steam only game.
Hopefully I’m not missing any horror villain games so far. So we had Alien Isolation, Friday the 13th, Predator, Evil Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and now we have two upcoming games which is Hellraiser and Halloween! Bruh I hope other devs do Nightmare on Elm Street, Childs Play, Scream, Jeepers Creepers, IT, Saw. Who else am I missing that needs a proper game? Any suggestions or thoughts or information about any other horror icons joining in having their own single player experience?
The size of his head 😂
R.I.P. Donald Pleasence
I for sure thought it was gonna start playimg micheals chase theme from dbd lmao
Can we not blow our fuckin ear drums out in the next trailer? thanks.
Had me until GUN. Those people ruin everything they touch
I need a Maniac Cop, pumpkinhead and phantasm video games
Gun and Illfonic can't help themselves but to try and replicate the "magic" people said they had with F13 and put a multiplayer mode in this too... Gonna have to wait and see gameplay after the failure that was TCM
If this is a game, I hope it does not have multiplayer. I hope it’s not an online game. I hope it’s just a storyline.
They finally figured out that the multiplayer shit doesn't work at least. Fire whoever did that horrible dr Loomis impersonation though. Should have just used the original recording. I might be interested if it's single player.
Please don’t let this be yet another 4v1 sort of multiplayer only game. It’s been done to death already.
Neat. Here's hoping for a Halloween III: Season of the Witch DLC.
Can't wait for it to be dumpstered after a few months.
I'm sorry, but what is that voice acting 😭
man I can't wait to get to play this game
we need this to be a trilogy.  halloween, thanksgiving, and christmas
Niceee! Finally👌😁
DAY 1!  Crossing my fingers for a Nintendo Switch 2 release down the road.
Yall learn your lessons from F13 and TCM. I no longer trust Gun Media and I suggest you don't either unless you want the thing you buy to be cut in a few years.
finally
I’m excited but I know it’ll just end up like the others 🤷🏼‍♂️
The narration is SO bad 😭
Don't let your hopes up, it's made by gun media and look how Friday the 13th and Chain Massacre went.
Not again, when I saw Gun. at the end I was like hell nah
With John Carpenter attached, if this game does amazing, I would love to see The Thing as a game! (Ik they made a janky one years ago already)
“He had the darkest eyes. The devils eyes”
Can we get A Nightmare On Elm Street 1984-2003 with Wes Craven as an executive producer?! Freddy Vs Jason as the final mission!
This game gonna die due to copyright reasons I just know it.
Single and Multi 🥺❤️
WE ARE SO BACK!
W
I hope Michael like a little better like body size. It looks a little Goofy but it definitely looks good and happy about it
LOOKS SO COOL
Looks so Classic !!!
😢🥹
This guy's Dr. Loomis impression sucks
WHO TF GAVE THE LISCENSE TO GUN
Heck yeah!!!!
This game should at least come out with 6 different expansions 🤣
Everyone winning against Michael Myers!!! The guy walks the same pace as a snail! 😂
Super excited 🙌🔥
Can we get a krampus Game based on the 2015 movie of the same name  the story mode and we can talk to the other survivors who survived the Christmas night against krampus and his helpers and his evil demonic toys monstrosities and the snow beast and new Monsters that you need to survive   And the survival mode just like in killer clowns from outer  space that you had to solve puzzles to escape  while krampus and his helpers and the new monsters are trying to catch them.
BEEN ASKING FOR THIS FOR MONTHS IF NOT YEARS, I WILL NEVER PLAY ANOTHER GAME, HE'S MY FAVORITE CHARACTER IN THE WORLD
This looks good
Voice acting needs abit more work doesn't feel like the doctor
This looks good
I would love to be pumped for this game but gun media is making it. Not a fan of them. They abandon their games super quick and the devs are jerks to their player base. You should see how they acted when people called them out. Unfortunately as much as I want to play this game it’s gonna be a hard pass from me.
😮 now we need a Ghostface game. Otherwise I'm excited Michael Myers is getting his own game, though I hope it doesn't end up like F13 or TCM.
Fuck yeah!
Single player so hopefully it plays like the new robo cop game
Please don't be by Illfonic or gun. Please don't be by Illfonic or gun! 😢
wow this looks like abysmal dogshit
Dumb. If you want to scratch that Halloween itch, just watch the original movie again.
I love this but hopefully they fix Michael’s body build, but I know this is not even close to the final version of the game
Let's just hope that this doesn't take Micheal out of dead by daylight like pinhead rip
Yesss! Finally!!!! 🎃
Is this why there is an updated Myers gameplay on one of the hotfix patches in DBD?
What is the name of this new Michael Myers game
Of course gun is making it too 😂
This mean he’s leaving DBD as a playable character?
Yes yes yes!!!! Finally something i can actually get excited about!!!🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃
don't know if i have much trust in another Illfonic+Gun (Media/Interactive) project of this kind, after the neglect the Friday the 13th game got from them
I just play dbd until these games come out
I like the idea of Horror Icon video game but they are always dog shit, and trying to copy Dead By Daylight.
we're finally getting a Michael Myers game before GTA 6
Yay another piece of asymmetric crap that will just be a start menu one day. And looking at Evil Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Killer Clowns it won't be that long. What a waste
You had me at single player I'm down to play it
Thank god this is single player imo That was the knock on the Texas chainsaw massacre game it sucked because of that for me Can't wait for this  Also I liked the Halloween and ash vs the evil dead game
I love Friday the 13th game to bad it's over I hope this will be just as good
He looks horrible, hopefully they work on making him look good.
Can’t wait to see it
Michael is walking with some swagger
Gonna tk everyone on this game 👀
Maybe they can finally add more cosmetics for Michael in Dead by Daylight
SIX TIMES! I SHOT HIM 6 TIMES IN THE HAAAART!!!
ISTG i’ve been been itching for a Halloween game..
This gonna flop like tcm and if there’s multiplayer then it’s not gonna have crossplay with every gen which also killed tcm lol
Well I guess it’s time to buy a video game console
Another horror game for Gun to throw away
And with this, asymmetrical horror comes to a close. Thank god. What a boring and stupid genre
Gun and Illfonic are back together. Either this will be absolute garbage, or absolute gold, and nothing in between. Hoping for gold.
And now, more 1 game to die, like Texas chainsaw 😢
I hope the single player is satisfying and has a great story even if recreating the movie- because seeing “Gun.” In the credits makes me not even wanna bother with the multiplayer
They need to make sure Michael's walk isnt what we just saw in this trailer. His movements have a signature emotionless vibe about it.
I absolutely LOVE the 70s vibe of the animation! This looks like it's gonna be a whole lot of fun! So glad John Carpenter is involved.
I can't wait to play this for the developers to abandon it!
Why is this narrated by Ringo Starr?
Straight off change the voice over actor, it doesn't sound right at all
Stop letting illfonic work on these things. They ruin every game they work on.
Gun will ruin this game to the ground and will abandon it just after a year just like in TCM. Illfonic worked on killer clowns and did a terrible job in development ,marketing and then abandoned the game as well with so many bugs in it. I guess whoever is in charge of movie licenses don’t do background checks.
Omg a cool game that might help to replace what was lost with Friday the 13th  *Gun*
Is Gun going to abandon this game just like TCM? This studio doesn't deserve money after the incompetence they showed w TCM.
I’m playing this one!
Let’s not forget this is the same game company that killed TCM and said it reached its “Full Potential” when there was leaks that said otherwise. To hell with Gun.
The time has finally come. Halloween The Game! I am so stoked!!!
Looks bad, michael looks like a kid in a costume, and loomis voice actor sucks…. Man
Hmm I'll stick to DBD Michael at least the survivors don't feel like they're walking away from me their, that was the dumbest looking running animation that I've seen, well since texas chainsaw.
YEAH “GUN” all i had to see not buying this lol they will just abandon it how they did tcm
The animations are way too exaggerated. She runs like a Pixar character and Michael doesn't sway.
Nah this ain’t it
Did Gun kick TCM to the curb so they could focus on making this ?
I LOVE IT
thank god it's single player
bro this looks ass imma go rewatch the DBD chapter trailer that shit was fire
this shit looks like assx
Yesssssss
Jason Voorhees: “It is up to you now, my friend.”
Anybody know what system it would be for?
It's Michael Mayers from hit game Dead By Daylight! How Delightfull!!!
Michael deserves this more than anybody dude. He's an OG, Jason got his game, Leatherface got his game, Freddy and Ghostface are in Mortal Kombat AND Dead By Daylight, Michael however...like I said he deserves this he's one of my favorites and I'm beyond hyped for him :))
Giys it literally says single and multiplayer. Wtf!!! Im a michael  myers addict and im fucking all in!
I'm going to play the hell out of this
Hopefully gun doesn’t ruin this
This game will die faster than Texas chainsaw massacre.
Michael casually Mori everyone 😂
Oh my god… OH MY GOD!🎉
Oh bullshit. Gun media?  Yeah the game will be dead in a year.
Guys im excited af! But WHY does the head look so big?! Fix that!
by GUN too. Oh I am excited. Please add Rob zombies Michael in here too😭
Please have this game include all of the different Michaels with the iconic locations from the films. The Friday the 13th game had potential but was stopped by the lawsuit.
Maybe this could be the first good asymmetric horror MP game from these devs lol
Righteous
I will be BUYING THIS GAME WHEN IT DROPS OMG DOES IT LOOK SO GOOD
I love that more horror IPs are getting to become video games, but my minor gripe is that they shouldn't have tried to impersonate Donald Pleasence. It doesn't work for me. You can keep Loomis but let Donald rest and get this AI-sounding monstrosity of an impersonation out.
Why is his frame so small
As a long-time Michael Myers fan, I hope they do the Boogeyman Justice. Please
So they can abandon it after a year run… nah I’ll pass GUN.
Whack
I stg this better be good
I was about to say, another reboot
I love and have met Michael Myers... I work at a Halloween warehouse... I love dead by daylight type games... Even with single player in this.... I don't see it lasting very long.. Hopefully I'm wrong
dont trust the developers they fucked it up with texas chainsaw massacre really badly dont get milked again guys
Can you get a good single player nightmare on elm street game
*Piano music intensifies.*
Hope it's for ps5
Imagine Michael Myers vs Jason vorhees
Storyline games > pvp
he doesnt walk with enough aura
The Dr. Loomis voice is hilariously bad.
Damn has there ever been a Halloween game before? This is cool
Another asymm thatll die out in a few months..
FINALLY HE'S WAY MORE BETTER THEN JASON
I hope this isn't gonna turn out to be another Friday the 13th/Killer Klowns from outer space issue.
Imagine if you get to play as Michael and it's a Hitman style game
Oh my gosh finally please tell me this will work on old gen if not I’ll be a big sad.
I think a lot of people have lost their minds.  Gun did a great job with Friday the 13th/TCM, despite the problems with the shutdown of F13 and the DLC issues with TCM.   Had a lot of fun with each game, memorable experiences in both for sure, you can also tell they are huge fans of horror and put tons of attention to detail in their games.  They WILL do a great job with this game
They heard Jason was getting a revival and was getting a game so they said let’s hurry and jump on that before they do😂
Where’s Friday the 13th?
Lfggggggg 👀👀👀👀👀
NOW WE NEED A GOOD OLE  A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. TRULY DONE RIGHT.🤔
This game looking good but i dont know this game how long live
It's made by a gun, that's why they completely abandoned Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
Finally, a new Halloween game, hope this is good, 'cause after Halloween Kills and Halloween Ends we were cooked.
Should have just been a single player cause I don’t want another DBD clone or Jason clone
Cause that didn't work for Friday the 13th or Texas chainsaw massacre
no one who is normal, still plays role playing games(Mr. Myers is included in that statement).
Big Fan of Halloween! I don’t really play horror games but I might give this one a chance.
So this is gonna be like Alien Isolation but with Michael Myers? Should be good. 😏
Pov: The game by Gunn Media Me: No thanks
The question is scratched mirror myers or tombstone? *drops pallet*
2026? *sighs*
surely this game won't get abandoned as quick as the texas chainsaw
Its about time.
Behavior out here like are we a joke to you.
Hope we get a Switch 2 version
ah...this does not look good at all ladies and gents..
It looks like the same animation as Dead by Daylight
Yall better hope in not in your lobby. Im going to be yelling "evil dies tonight" the whole game.
watch it just be an f13 reskin
Is this going to be another dead by daylight style
LETS GOOOOOO, FINALLY A MICHAEL MYERS GAME
Another dbd victim 😔
I wobder will michael myers have other styles to wear
This time they better have proximity chat. 10+ characters AT release.  On mass mix and match costumization. And hair physics.  Thx. We can't wait
This halloween crap is so overplayed. Move on lol.
Man just hearing that score gave me goosebumps
Definitely hope that it isn't going to be like that garbage Friday the 13th game that came out for the PS4.
Hopefully its better than the Atari game.
another Friday the 13th: The Game
THANKYOU !
YES YES YES
First, a Hellraiser game was announced, then a new Friday, the 13th game, and now a Halloween game? Holy shit it is a jackpot for horror fans!
Thank the lord for single player. So many IP horror games are just dead by daylight now
illfonic and GUN. Totally dodging since second 3 Sorry, i love so much Halloween franchise but i am not getting scammed and trolled by these studios after F13, TCM and KKFOS Mark my words since now:  - GUN. will abandon the game eventually after 1 year  - Each new DLC will be OP, 2 weeks later it gets nerf, making the game pay 2 win - Bugs that were seen since beta will stay forever and few of them will be fixed - Mods will attack personally the users whose propose any fix - Michael Myers will be so weak on release - Optimization will be awful - Hackers are going to be a plague again and devs will killswitch crossplay
Wtf is this shit???
Finally...
You can't kill the boogeyman.......  John wick dlc incoming 😂
Going die the same way Friday the 13th did
Ill be ready
FINALLY
The first Halloween game was on Atari 2600 I believe.
Remember what they did to TCM....
another drop and dump game from gun media? Who is falling for this scam lol.
Y’all don’t forget what happened with TCM . The only reason why I’m  somewhat hopeful is because they collaberated  with Carpenter and IllFonic.  If it was just GUN on his own , wouldn’t waste my money. Proceed with caution everyone 😟!
I hope this is more like F13 because that was fantastic. Had many hours on that game. Klowns was entertaining but didn't last long. Texas chainsaw was solid, but the confusing map design pulled me away.
I wanna play as michael!
we got a Hellraiser and a Halloween game, Announce a Nightmare on Elm Street game, we know someone gotta be working on it
That narration was horrible
Don't get too hyped for this. This game has all the classic makings of your typical gun media / Illfonic game. Get a popular IP, make a generic asym game and abandon it in less than a year. They have done this with Friday the 13th, Evil Dead, Predator and most recently with Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
Eh
When they say single player. Hopefully they don’t just mean the same default missions with static character art having text bubbles over them.
😊
How exciting? This seems like a hard task to tackle. I am pumped.
A Hellraiser game that looks amazing, and now this one too? I hope it's all really cool.
Why make games for it to only last 1 year? I will never support another Gun IP again after the tragedy of what was Texas Chainsaw Massacre the Game.
Let's freakin GO! This has got all of the vibes of the OG. Michael Myers, the King of Halloween
No one is going to play this a year after it releases. IF YOU WANT TO SELL A HALLOWEEN GAME THAT MAKES MILLIONS, MAKE A HITMAN IOI STYLE GAME WHERE WE PLAY AS MICHAEL AND KILL PEOPLE. SINGLEPLAYER. EVERY MOVIE. EVERY COSTUME. NO MULTIPLAYER.
i was happy seeing this trailer, but then...  "co-published by Gun Interactive"  Oh noo.....
That's what I'm talking about 😅❤🎉
was happy to see this as a game till I saw the Gun media logo. F13 and TCM failure coming in boys.
Looks good but the fortnite character running out the house completely ruined the atmosphere.
I know it! I knew after Friday the 13th game and Texas chainsaw someone would make a Halloween gsme
I need this 😅
wow... this looks like shit
Don’t buy this game, GUN will take your money and let the game die within 1 month
Another dead by daylight clone I'm sure
It should have a choose your own timeline feature so you play all the different movies.
we get a halloween game before GTA 6
I am gonna crap my pants playing this
Okay! Make this like Outlast trials and im sold! No 4v1
People gonna hate over anything huh lmao.  The voice was fine.  It’s not gonna be Donald’s exact voice because he’s dead.  Bros dead.
don't ruin it like you took away the F13 license.
Why didn’t they just use Donald Pleasance’s actual voiceover from the movie?
I'm hoping this fills the gap that Friday the 13th left.
Say what you will about Boss team games and Saber when it comes to the Evil dead game, but at least they have, learned and leaned into single player experiences.
I’m here for it!
Dislike the choice of Loomis’ VA. Should’ve just used Malcom McDowell, he was the best part of the rob zombie films and his voice is just perfect for the role. This guy sounds like he’s two coughs away from the coffin
FINALLY!!!!!!
Gun Media is attached - the game won't last.
Finally single player.
How do you do a single player Halloween game, lol
I have Halloween fatigue
knowing Gun is behind this i doubt online will last long... itll be abandoned just like tcm
The Night HE Come Home!
Hope the single player is better then Friday the 13th game
Awesome
We already have a game like this. It’s called dead by daylight. This will probably be the same premise. People will play for a little while and then we’ll go back to dead by daylight.
Guys, if this is bad at first, PLEASE, instead of just showing hate, give constructive criticism or something because this looks amazing and looks like it has potential
Oh boy, can’t wait for the overpriced DLC and 2 year life span
Gun Media, please try to keep the licence for this one
wack
Can't wait for all the reviews that call this a "Dead By Daylight killer" 3 months before it shuts down.
Ooooof...there has to be a thousand people on Fiver who could do a better Donald Pleasance imitation than this guy.
That's not dr.loomis 😂
Single player YES. Multiplayer  please, please don't copy DBD.
The running animations and movement could use some work. Needs to be more fluid and less cartoony. The graphics need more realism as well. Everything else is great!
Bros got a big ol noggin
If they include the until dawn director for the game along with carpenter they can create a beautiful game 🖤😈
😮is it asymmetrical
Michael Myers for MK1
Please please, a original game, not one more copy of dead by daylight
Hope this more of a F13 than a TCM
Unfortunate that gun is making this they straight up abandoned Texas chainsaw massacre and drip fed content
I know these are early animations, and I don't now how to make a game... that said, Michael doesn't have swagger like this in his movements.
it better not be a Rip off and online multiplayer only . because then your game can never be owned and only played online at the mercies of the companies .
Badass hoping it jas a storyline to it
Canny wait man
Hopefully couch co-op also
Michael’s weakness is someone with more stamina than a senior citizen.
My favorite killer has come❤❤
Will Myers have a sidekick like in the recent movie ? ^^
ah yes they butchered friday the 13th , killed texas chainsaw massacre and stopped support for it too lets bet how long this game lasts
What in the blue hell is that narration?
Let's go, I enjoyed F13th and can't wait to see what yall cook up
I’ve been running round the house and called the wife to tell her 😂 Halloween and gaming are my two favourite things in the world what a moment.
Did Dead by Daylight have to suffer another loss for this to happen?
1963? I thought it was in 1978?
if it's GUN Entertainment's hands it's not even worth buying, they are straight up just butchering every slasher movie like they did with tcm
Next year?!   bro😒
I will be saving my money for this mf right here after all these years 🎉
How many times have we killed him & yet hes just like chucky keeps coming back smh
Praying for this game to flop so Illfonic and Gun will finally just fucking shut down.
I really, REALLY hope the single player side of things is strong. I'll still occassionally go back to Friday the 13th and Evil Dead for offline content, but they could have been so much more. Please don't neglect that side of the game
Okay, so the Halloween Micheal Myers game is confirmed to be single player and multiplayer  I rather have a single player horror game. Imagine a Hitman style game where you control a horror icon? We don't need multiplayer that will die out due to oversaturated market.
Some games that are too dangerous to create
cant wait for this game i been waiting for a halloween game for so longgggg
So this is why Gun left TX Chainsaw Massacre game to die huh
All I had to see was gun media its a hard no already
Why does it look lower budget than The Texas Chainsaw Massacre game if it's made by the same people?
I am loving these new single player horror games with actual story mode! This and hellraiser is gonna set the high bar for movie monsters
please be an alien isolation type game
I’m excited to see John Carpenter and Malek Akkad overseeing this. Looking forward to hearing more.
Awesome 🎃💀
I hope they don’t shut down the game after i get addicted!! like friday the 13th the game 😢
Gotta be honest, the animation and voice acting both seem a little... Lackluster. But I'm still holding out that they make something good. I enjoy TCM to this day, all I ca do is pray they do Halloween right
Please don't be just another dead by daylight clone
I want first a campaign mode, then a multiplayer mode.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What an awful trailer
That looks like TRASH
I’m Guessing Kane plays MICHAEL in this game like he did for Jason on the Friday the 13th game . For Gun
Gun. is involved, nevermind.
Finally, a new HALLOWEEN (MICHEAL MYERS) game.
I thought we would’ve learned from the last time, why is gun working on this?!
I been waiting for this for 30 years💯🤷🏿
MY BOY MICHAEL! 🎃🔪🧡
Sick! I hope they go the same route that the new hellraiser game has gone and not another dead by daylight rip like the friday the 13th game,, these games have a good backstory and that needs to be honoured
Well it definitely going to be like Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game
From the same dev that shot down 'Friday the 13th: The Game'
so its that friday the 13th game but they have the rights this time?
So….ANOTHER Dead by Daylight / Friday 13th clone……yawn
I should be more excited for this as Halloween is one of my all time favorite films but I have absolutely zero faith in GUN due to their Abysmal handling of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre licence. I might check it out IF it survives longer than 3 years and the majority of the movies get covered in some way, but considering how slow both GUN and Illfonic are at pushing out DLC and good content I'm not holding my breath.   I supported the ever loving shit out of all their previous games, bought every price of content hoping for a long life span for their games and they let me and many others down every step of the way. They bandoned them all FAR TO SOON! Fool me once, shame on you, fool me 5+ times shame on me.
Welp… I’ll go get my wallet. If Mortal Kombat won’t have Michael Myers in their game. Michael Myers will make his own!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪
Another dbd, Texas massacre game, killer clowns game
Ended Texas Chainsaw, ran away from F13, Predator gets nothing but empty DLC and broken updates, and Killer Klowns got nothing for a whole year.  Not going near this because of its creators
|Now we need Elm Street and we’ve got the whole gang of slashers|
Can’t wait to pay 50 bucks for a game that’ll last 2 months with 30 dollar Michael Myers skins. Gun really lost me at TCM
Game looks like shit lmao... in 2025 this is what they give us... gtfo
What’s the boogeyman?
After Friday the 13th and Texax chainsaw massacre I was waiting for this.
I hope theres a story mode and it's not like a online game running from the killer
Finally!
I had my AirPods in. That opening sound almost gave me Tinnitus.
I'm getting goosebumps! I love the atmosphere!!
truly terrible trailer
Minus the weird narration, this was actually a nice trailer. Can't wait to stalk people without their consent (my PC is not running this game)
Is this a joke? 2026 game with 2000 graphics. Games are getting laughable. The voice over shows all the hopes I have for this game.
As long as you DON'T play as Michael, I'm down. I hated that about the Friday the 13th game that you had t be Jason in the single player off line part. I want a story mode where you have to try to survive.
This looks sick
Gun lol
The friday the 13th game was better
You know what isnt asymmetrical...    yo ass.
Can't wait for them to not listen to the people who play the game, insult their players, barley communicate, leave things bugged for weeks to months on end and, not fix the core issues with the game, then abandon the game even though they were sitting on a literal gold mine and could've kept the game thriving and earning money from the game for years if they had just listened. (R.I.P. TCM)
GUN in participation, no the game will last 2 years and everything will stop after like texas chainsaw, so it's dead for me we can say what we want about Dead By Daylight with the licenses on it as well as the horrible community, but they are still there because they do not let go of their game
Illfonic i back at it again
Have a huge smile on my face. I hope it’s kind of similar to the Friday the 13th game.
The scariest part of this is reading this is done by GUN who made TCM into a dire situation. It's a no from me.
Guys, quit being little babies about the voice over of Dr. Loomis, at least we’re getting a brand new Halloween game, and honestly, this looks so damn fun and terrifying. Count me in!! Now I desperately want a PS5.
He finally got a video game
Fuck yessss let's go finally my goat gets a game.
So they will cut him from DbD now?
With Malek and John Carpenter behind the project how the hell did they approve that Dr. Loomis voice actor narrator? That was the worst thing of that whole trailer that nearly ruined the whole experience for me. That was awful! Hire a new voice actor ASAP before release or get permission from Donald Pleasance estate to include his voice dialogue.
I think people forget that Gun is a small indie game company that is relatively new and still learning.
Hopefully this game can be the one to give DBD a kick in the pants and a sense of urgency in terms of competition.
Is this another one of those lame online games with no story just random online play like Jason or Texas chainsaw. I’m good I’ll pass. Even the narrator sucks
Lost me at 1v4 asym with illfonic and Gunn media   Not gonna be fooled twice this game will be dead by next Halloween
how does GUN have ANOTHER IP to butcher?
I need it!! 🔥🔥
glad these slasher movie legends are getting games
NOOOOOOOOOO ITS MADE BY GUN :(
Calling it now, they will abandon this game before the 2 year mark.
Wife and I met John Carpenter at a signing this weekend at Midsummer scream. When our turn came up, Greg Nicotero (Walking Dead, Creepshow and FX artist of many before) pops up from nowhere and starts chatting with John about projects like 2 dudes talking about their days at the office. Got a pic of them both. Cool to be in front of 2 horror legends
Here's hoping that's not how the characters move when the game comes out.
Don't trust illfonic, this will get get abandoned in a year.
Fuck GTA6 when we have these games 🤘🏻
It seemed good until I saw the way the characters actually look
So TCM died for this ? 🙄
GAMEPLAY WHEN
the fact that they are advertising it as being a SP and MP game has me interested.
Oof. Just based on that voiceover alone i'm passing on this clearly low budget nonsense. The mic had audible hiss and it sounded like an American doing a dodgy south African impression. God knows why, since in the movies the guy is British.
Oh yes another Gun game that's gonna be abonded within two years ☺️
I could literally cry… this is a dream come true for me… I remember watching Halloween for the first time with my mother when I was like 6 or 7 lol I’ll never forget it. This just became my most anticipated game
Is it gonna be like every other horror movie video game, where it gets worse over time and then just stop getting supported?
Chill bumps
About F’ING TIME 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Another dead by daylight clone
DONT FUCK THIS UP GUN!
I wonder if Myers will be pulled from Dead by Daylight too.
Keen to see how this plays, but that is a rough trailer.
This game will be dead in a few years just like texas chainsaw and friday 13th and evil dead
It's obviously gonna be like Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw Massacre
I wonder if it's gonna be like Friday the 13th the game or if it's gonna be a story game
So how long after launch will this one shit down Gun.?
PLEASE VOICE CHAT !!! like on friday 13th
Hopefully Michael doesn’t get his ass best and mask taken by a young man half his size.
Horrible Narrator
Illfonic just pulled a Marvel rivals 💀
My kind of party.. I'm hoping to leave DBD behind damn it. I was hoping Friday The 13th would take the throne. Then Texas Chain Saw. You up next Mike.
LETS GOOOO IM SO HYPED
I hope this doesn't turn out to be nothing but more multiplayer trash.
“It wasn’t just a killing spree — it was a reckoning” oh no they haven’t got ChatGPT to write the dialogue have they 😅
Отлично, очередная игра от ганов, очередное говно
lesss goo
Why does Michael's head look so much bigger than his body?
Legs batman:dark knight & Halloween game holy 2026 is packed the games,movies all FANTASTIC
Someday, I hope we get a Final Destination game! That would be awesome!
Imma support the mess outta this game I need to see A Nightmare On Elm Street and Scream games next
Don't Say it... don't say it... don't !! say!! IT!! it's a DBD KILLER!!!!   haaaaaaaaa (no, it's not gonna be)
This is fucking cool!!!!!
Early 90s kids are gonna be happy
“Asymmetric” “multiplayer” = dead in a year.
I really hope that the game will be in the style of Friday the 13th.
lets goooooooooo
Oh My F God Is This Really Real If So I Can't Wait For This To Come Out
After what they've done with Friday and more specifically with Texas... Yeah no.
Now we need a new movie please
It's time to play everyone favorite game. How long till the developers stop supporting the game
rip texas chainsaw
Can’t wait for illfonic to drop this less than a year into its life cycle
No offence, but I'll stick with DBD
Goddamn I got my headphones in and that music is still just incredible. Amazing.
finally
I PRAYED FOR THIS DAY AM LITERALLY CRYING OMFG BRO😭😭🙏🙏🙏🙏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This game won't last. It will be dead within months. Just look at all of the other horror titles turned video games. TCM, Killer Klowns, Friday the 13th. Devs continuing to make games we don't really want.
2 John Carpenter games in 2026!😊 Just give me playable Joe Grizzly for the survivors.
Cautiously optimistic.
What system?
I pray this game be good. I loved friday13& Texas chainsaw
Now all we need is a ghost face game and we’re set
also, we need a Nightmare on Elm Street video game, with Robert Englund reprising his role as Freddy Kruger, and it better have like a story mode.
They should've been did a Michael Myers game
No way…NO WAY…NO WAY MY FAVORITE SLASHER IS GETTING HIS OWN GAME! ❤
he got some little ass shoulders
asymmetric stealth horror =\    wHY CAN'T WE HAVE STORY DRIVEN HORROS GAMES WITH THESE BIG IPS?
this game better have a story mode, cause when they did Friday the 13th for a video game, there was no story mode, just having you kill a bunch of campers in various ways.
I shot him 6 times.
This is definitely a must have!!!  Hopefully its out in time for Halloween😅
Another "one v many" multiplayer experience that will die in half a year like texas chainsaw did and f13. I dont trust anything gun gets attached to. Its wild people keep getting rights for horror properties ro make a "multiplayer" game knowing they wont support it for long
My excitement was reserved until i saw there's a single player experience too. I haven't disliked Guns other games but asymmetrical horror hasn't really been my thing. But I love Halloween. hopefully this is solid. Especially since I think Texas Chainsaw really improved what they did on F13.
I just want to know how much of the game will be singleplayer because it's safe to say the multiplayer aspect will be dead in a year like every other Illfonic game
It better be a new story. Micheal impacted more than just Laurie’s life.
Yeah but is it gonna be good, where you have ragdoll physics, where you can kill multiple ways, you have story lines, it’s very bloody. I hope it’s good.
Just...dead by dailight
i wonder if they're gonna use different stages from all the movies
It's so good to see that this isn't an online game, as it will never die for lack of players
the animation quality is straight from the 70's.
Bootleg Donald Pleasence voice lol
Wack af.
I sincerely hope he’s the playable character and from his perspective and it’s not an “escape” the killer online game.
Honestly speaking it’s already surpassed the Jason game because the Jason was only multiplayer whereas Halloween is single and multiplayer
Console ?
“Dr. Loomis” the narrator
W Reveal I cannot wait for this game! 🎉🎉🎉
Don't trust these guys' gun interactive is known to rug pole.
I'm not keeping my hopes up, if it's the same people who worked on Friday the 13th and TCM. The track record is not good. Two years from now, this will be in trash, and we'll get Scream trailer.
FUCK YA 🤤
IllFonic! GUN! please, please don’t screw this up. GTA 6 might be everyone else’s most hyped game but this right here is mine. I’m so damn excited! Trailer was 🔥
Dang I really thought it was coming out this October
This is the same studios that made predator: hunting grounds,texas chainsaw massacre and friday the 13
John carpenter boutta cook
This game needs similar game mechanics as Friday the 13th. Hopefully, it can be as good
Illfonic + gun media + old horror i.p. = easy pass.
How about a Nightmare on Elm Street Game?
Ouuu single player AND multiplayer?? Nice!
I really hope this is more like Outlast where you can hide from Michael in a closet while he chases you or something. I don't want another Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Killer Klowns from Outer Space. It'll probably be like that, but I hope not. It still looks amazing and I'm still going to play it, though. 😂🎃🔪
Michael is the 🐐🐐
Single and multi ?
I hope this don’t turn out to be another Friday the 13th flop.
ANOTHER asymmetric horror game? No. Stop. Go away.
Why does this studio keep getting these movie rights to games? After how both TCM and F13 games were handled?!
Don't give Gun or illfonic a dime. They have lied to us and abandoned both f13 and tcm. They will do the same with this.
Another gun game. Yeah... cant wait for support to just up and die.
I haven’t seen the video, nor have I seen who the developer is, but just from the title I’m already imagining it’s the same people who made Friday the 13th and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, only to then abandon them. Am I right? What’s next, an asymmetrical game of The Hills Have Eyes?
John Carpenter would be proud!
Another horror IP for gun and illfonic to ruin 😢
It better not be some puzzle game this time.
This smells like TCM and Friday the 13th combined. Just set in Haddonfield.....Do we get to be the teens or Dr. Loomis??
Gun and Illfonic make great games, but absolutely suck at supporting them. They closed the door on new content for TCM a year after release. I'm hoping they won't do anything similar here...
Oh man a Halloween game can’t wait   *sees gun studios logo*   Nevermind
I was excited at first, but the narrator sounds so… off.  I don’t wanna just jump to AI, but it’s either that or the VA just… sounds like that.  But then there’s the animations too!  Felt like there was too little and way too much movement at the same time in that run.  Calling this a “horror experience” also doesn’t help, makes it sound like it’s actually just a walking sim.
Man, after years since Halloween was released for Atari back then, it's finally getting is own game like a multiplayer from friday the 13th Game.
mds eu já quero jogar!!!!
Gun will ruin it loomis voice actor is awful
The narrator sounds odd...almost sounds edited
about fucking time!
I can’t wait! So excited to play as Michael and torment Haddonfield🎃
Is this from the same people who made Friday the 13th?
So do u run around killing horney teenagers? Or is this another hide and seek with no weapons?
Since john Carpenter is on this, this game will be better than Friday,  no legal issues, this game will thrive.
Friday the 13th will forever be missed, I hope this is just as good
Cool.  I wish Friday the 13th had more of an offline single player/multiplayer component to extend its life now that the servers were shut down.
Ps2 graphics
Albino William Shatner is coming to get you.
Gotta say. That was a VERY bad Donald Pleasance impression by the narrator
Don’t hold your breath on the single player experience being good. It will be very basic and bare bones.. very short..the majority of the game’s resources are going to the multiplayer mode that’s where they see their income revenue coming from.
Illfonic is great at getting IP but suck at post launch support
Is Jamie Lee Curtis involved..
Don’t trust these guys after they completely Flunked TCM.
WTF 👍🏻 Halloweens my favourite film, great news
That Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) voice imitation was horrible, dude tried so much, but sounded totally weird: just sayin'.
👀 Let's see gameplay
WE ARE SO BACK! I NEED THIS TO REPLACE WHAT THEY TOOK FROM ME WITH FRIDAY 😭
Illfonic probably going to abandon this game too
Fuck yes I just hope it's not multiplayer bullshit
Il never buy a game from gun again after the way they cash grabbed Texas chainsaw massacre and then abandoned it. Also take ages to sort bugs out.
Is there a story mode to this or just another online game
Great another horror game that will last 1 month before its deserted
Looks like 💩
Not Rly Interesting After DBD, FriDay 13, ETC,.. 🤦‍♂
Delighted
Please don't be like Dead by Daylight
Welcome, Dead by daylight 2.0
This will suck ass, but dope trailer bar the janky running physics.
YES!!!
I just now Saw it Says Releasing in 2026😔
Just make it play similar to the Friday the 13th game, minus the bugs, and I'll be happy.
YES!!!
Bruh please don’t get my hopes up for a good horror game that ends up not being developed after a period of time and ultimately shut down.
Everyone has to right to spend their money the way they want but hear it from someone who played f13 and supported TCM until now, do not support gun media, they’re gonna stop supporting the game as soon as they get bored of it which is basically a year or 2 max
THIS IS GONNA BE PEAK!🔥
Can't wait to walk, or walk slowly...
Hopefully the Game he deserved. Iconic figure
yesss💪🔥
Bro I’ve been waiting 40 years for this
1:35 And the dwerking begins
Plot twist: Michael Myers is the hero, and he saves everyone
PLEASE DONT MAKE IT A MULTIPLAYER GAME. NO ESCAPING AND STUFF. JUST A STORY GAME
("DEATH2SONY"😂😂) Recent trilogy...the third movie, "Halloween Ends"? Huge let down. The director let it go to his head, Im going for an oscar, this is a love story, with Michael Myers in the background 🙂...what?!   A Halloween movie is Michael Myers repeatedly plunging a butcher knife, until someone stops him 😂!
Animations/movements look like cheap 90's stuff
Well my guess is that Freddy, Chucky and the  leprechaun are next to get in their own games
I’m going to play the hell out this
Did they get the intern to voice this intro?
This was such a crap trailer, thanks again Illfonic.
I’m ready
i really hope this isn’t another friday the 13th or texas chainsaw type game
YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Le thème à la fin, je sais pas vous, mais moi, des sacrés frissons!
Walking simulator horror game let's goo!!!!
有史以来最好的恐怖片
The blackest eyes...
They never give their game support longer than 2-3 years when they market them as long-time support they pulled the plug on Friday the 13th and Texas chainsaw massacre
Mikey been getting milked like a cow since 1978
Can't wait for Halloween's IP to go in Limbo so illfonic have to stop production again.
Remember it’s by the same people that made TCM
Whatever, I'm sure it will be Dead By Dalyight or some equally dubious horseshit.
If this effects DBD ima be so damn pissed😭
Hellraiser and Halloween games nice
Single player experience, that’s atleast a good thing to see
We finally getting a Michael Myers game hopefully it don’t suffer the same fate as Jason game did
Awesome🎃
Can’t wait!
Oh hell yes
Beautiful 😭
