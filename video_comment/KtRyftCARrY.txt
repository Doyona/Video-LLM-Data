"Hey Mozzy, I've been a fan for a while, but I can't help but feel concerned about the violent themes in your lyrics. Have you considered embracing a more positive message or surrendering your life to Christ? It could bring a powerful change to your music and impact listeners in a different way. Just a thought, wishing you the best on your journey."
How can I send you some merch?
