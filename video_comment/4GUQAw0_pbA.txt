Bent it like a banana
Wicked spin? There was no spin, hence the unpredictability.
Bro did a volleyball jump float in football
one good thing about knuckleball is goalkeeper cant predict the trajectory and a bad thing about knuckleball is player who shoot also dont know the trajectory of ball
I know things are looking dire right now. But the good thing about bringing Amorim in now is that we know the players that can and can't play this system. So we can have direction and intent in the summer window. This season is a testing round for these players
crazy knuckle right there
Why was that GK about to yous    his feet
Goalkeeper had a bet on that game no doubt

Knuckleballs don't have spin It's literally the base of a knuckleball, no spin
Use your hands.
Its crazy hard to save those knuckleballs especially when its from a really good hitter cuz it changes its line mid air like several times so cant predict where the ball will go the ball can move like the ball from quidditch😂
That shot is mad 💀
The Keeper Lagged
Doesn’t the name knuckleball mean that there is no spin?
(Caption) There’s no spin on the ball that’s quite literally what makes a knuckleball
The balls are so light these days it's hard not to do it
Use your hand ,you are GK
A knuckle ball relies on the lack of apin
I wonder how many goals I’ve yelled at the GK from the TV angle thinking it was easy only to have been harder at a different angle.
You have an amazing talent! Keep spreading joy through your creativity
Another thing to pack in the end of the world survival kit
Just do It with your hands 😂
Me waiting for someone to say the answers
IT DISGUSTINGLY NASTY
Cant even blame the keeper
It was right at him then he had an easy Dave with his foot and then it ended up 2 feet to the right disgusting knuckle
Farmers league
What can he do? The wind has changed the course of the ball. I'm sad for him😑
I can watch it all day
How did he not save that?
Hasta olvidó que podía tomarla con las manos
Spin? Knuckleballs dont spin.
Ngl that is the best knuckleball I have ever seen
Why did he use his feet but not his hands?
Dan dia bukan onana
TRYNA BE EVERYWHERE READ MY BIO! ‼️🚨🆘
knuckleballs don't have spin, that's what makes them unpredictable. the caption should read "the absence of spin" rather than "the spin. tsk tsk
Where are his hands?
Why use feeet?
Had the goalie discombobulated 😂
As a keeper these feel almost as hard to stop as PKs because your just taking an educated guess where to go when it’s hit right. Worst is the top corners
The confidence to try to hit a knuckle ball from out there is insane
Why in bundesliga dont like defending? Serious question
Bro the background song😂😂😂😂 gives tom and Jerry vibes 😂😂😂
I feel so godamn stupid when people hit this right at me
Least deserved goal.  Poor GK.  Terrible but lucky shot
Naaaa he can drop his gloves down 🤦 He got to dive  Good point : he will become a consultor 😂
That knuckle with a ordinary ball is crazy ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
That’s why goalkeepers should use their hands
you’ll never know how much knuckleballs suck until you take one in the wrong spot because it moved last-second
Rukaku…
Whos that?
That would have been tough even if he wasn’t backpedaling. The fact that the last swerve was so close is insanely hard to save.
Knuckle💥
Where is yours hands!! 🤔🤔
GK forgot he could use his hands 😂
The goalkeeper is too short. If his leg is 50cm longer, he would have stop the ball 😂
Black people just love to cheat
I think its better for the GK to dive in that situation than try to kick it, as it travels fast
I hv noticed 1 thing that gk glitches happen in fifa nd bundesliga majorly...
Ball was like you got me ... Sikeee 😂
I guess you mean "spin" as in the change of direction? Weird term to use when the knuckleball effect is due to the lack of spin
Endrick kick...powerful
rma gk kit?
Goal keeping error.  He needed to  go low even if the ball was going to swerve unpredictably.   At least at full stretch for a grounder shot he would have a chance
Keeper should be saving that. Pathetic goal keeping
Holy smokes 😮
bundesliga quality is laughable
Very smart shot by the striker in that situation  - GK already backpedalling etc 👏
This is ridiculous what is that a kids ball
I dont trust these balls. No technique but still it wont go where it is kicked
Farmers league
Why were the midfielders yelling at the gk 😂
Moving backwards was his biggest problem...
All i see is an amazing goal
Jabulani vibe
looks like he had a bet going on
Knuckle ball is hard to stop
Now imagine trying to hit a baseball that's doing that. 😂
That is cheating Red card
真っ直ぐ打って、この変化球か、、
It isnt spin. It was a knuckle ball. Knuckle balls dont spin and are thought to have a laiminar turbulent transition in the air about them causing irratic movement in the air.
Knuckleball literally caused by zero/near-zero spin but ok
GK was unbalanced while running backwards instead of in ready position, otherwise, not as hard to stop.
Power Knuckle balls are the hardest to save
Supporters on the side, "stupid goalie, that an easy stright ball 😡" Supporters behind the goal "😮😮woah, can't blame the keeper"
Forgot he could use his hands or what😂?
We had balls like that, you buy a plastic pistol, plastic watch and you get the ball for free.
The ball was faulty
The balls should be illegal.
If you score a free kick with that you're a goat 🐐
I once did the same thing on a counter attack. It went straight through the keepers legs. He was so embarassed he subbed himself off haha
He could had blocked it if he wasn't moving backwards
What the heck is the GK doing? See the other angle - Oh nevermind.
Keeper was completely out of place
Absolutely no chance for the goalkeeper
Feel bad for him, the fact that he was in the middle of going back made the save much harder than it was
Street football with fly away balls !
Actually it’s the extreme lack of spin that makes a knuckleball behave so unpredictably.
The smart thing is to just get on ut side to try to cover as much space as possible
The caption got me dying because there is no spin in knuckleball shots
Los goles de Endrick
He would be feasting if Onana was in goal
The spin was bad but you can't save a shoot if you are retreating like that. No need to keep going back.
Nasty Finish
Esquema de aposta tá acabando com o futebol 😢
I wish I could do that  but good goal
Cristiano
Reminds me of the time when we had decent balls
Es lo que hablamos ayer, Extasis y sus fuentes raras haciendo videos todos los dias de lo mismo y no dando ni una. Por otra parte que mas da que salga todo en PS o Xbox. Son videojuegos y cuantos mas puedan disfrutarlos, jugar y comprarlos mejor para nosotros. Cuanto mas dinero recauden mas juegos haran, mejores juegos y mas salud para los servicios de suscripcion y las desarrolladoras. Yo prefiero pagar 250€ al año y juegar a muchos triples a que, pagar lo mismo y tener 3 juegos. Que mania y que obsesion. Feliz navidad, por cierto.
That's why I told him to try use his hand as far as possible.
Reverse swing cricket ball ahh spin
right left right left 😂 I don't blame the keeper he was back peddling as well 😂
The ball “floats”, same as in volleyball with float serves, so it can be achieved hitting the ball without spin.
The lack of spin*
As a gk knuckle balls are the ops
My naija people know say na JuJu bi that 😂
That is a bend right? Not spin.
The spin did him dirty
This is not a spin, it's a completely spinless shot, which made it so unpredictable, if it had spin, would be a very predictable curve
Set ur feet goalie
Doubt a Mitre Max would have done that
Bro forgot he could use his hands
When goalkeepers let in an easy shot people never see the true angel of it and hiw hard it really was to stop
*melodie*, "chtěl bych se jmenovat Jan.."
Called a knuckleball,,hard to defend something that even itself doesn't know where it's going
The GK forgot he had hands
Maybe keep your foot on the ground?
Me trying to catch my 3 yo.
what the fu-
and this is why de gea saves knuckle balls w his chest
Marcus Thuram??? 😮
pov: ronaldo whatching this
Yep 😢 People doesn't know how hard to catch that kind of ball.
Whos the striker?
That's a fantastic shot
ㅗㅗ
Why was he running back so fast... that just makes the goal bigger. It open up the angle, and complicates diving
Dont blame the spin that was incompetence
That knuckleball was absolutely insane
As a GK, I hate ball like that, man. Because people will think if I'm just useless.
Knuckle doesn’t have any spin
A LOW KNUCKLEBALL?
RF Goalkeepers😂😂😂
He could have done nothing except badly read the shot and getting lucky lol
GK looking like he plays for a womans team 💀
Match fixing😂😂😂
Messi cant do this lol
You don't save a knuckle by running away from it
İşte buna ölü yaprak denir
That's not good goalkeeping. First of all he is an embarrassment under pressure... Second of all that was easily a save by hands if the posture was correct....   Tell me how wrong I am 👇
This is what Onana thought he saw vs Brentford
That was nasty
I love how (as a Goalkeeper) I'm seeing people saying that was his fault, no it wasn't, that is probably the hardest shot to save you can think of. Even a top corner dive would be preferred by most goalkeepers 😂 I'd bet all my money that none of the people hating on that Goalkeeper could even get close to that ball WHILE RUNNING BACKWARDS 😂.  Keep your opinions to yourself if you don't even think about it😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It's not spin tho, that's the point
Hand was invented 2024 Before 2024 here go: 🗿🤣
That guy knew  he hit em like that!otherwise u cant shoot from that far like that and expect to score
Am i only one who thought that song is similar to intro of gta 6
ボール⚽️の重心が傾いているかも
The issue here is that the gk was still moving backwards when the kick happened. Thats a gg
You should have gone with the hands
You can yous your hands for a reason 😂😂😂
What spin? It was a knuckleball, it literally had no spin, it was the way it moved like a balloon
Is Cristiano the inventory of knuckleball goals ?
skill issue
Yeahhhh GK wasn’t saving that lmao
wdym spin, literally the point of that kind of shot is no spin at all
Which sport is this?
Shots like this you just have to hold your dive as long as you can until you can get a final read. He reads and commits too early.
Actually it’s a wicked lack of spin no
As a goalie  I HATE THOSE SHOTS They are damn annoying and unpredictable  The weakest one could be deceiving
The entire point of a knuckleball is that the Ball basically doesnt spin 😅
Bro unlocked a power in midbattle
Why can't he grab the ball with his hand?😅😅😅😅
Ăn đi ô na na
What  about  CR7 💀
Bribe
😅
Farmers league at it’s peak
GK reacted so quickly he got yeeted
Gyro Just like from blue lock kicked by yukimiya
That was unlucky. If a prem goalie had done that, everyone would hate on him. People don't understand how hard it is to stop shots like those.
There is no spin on knuckle ball 😅😅😅
It is same as that bazooka ball used in world cup such type of balls are nightmare for keepers and shouldn't be allowed
The gk shouldn’t be gk that’s all
Was that bonifasee?
That's what happens when you ask the local magician to do tricks with the ⚽ ball. 😆 😆 😂
Kuytu bir 😂😅🎉😅🎉😅
Had him looking like Onana 😂
Reminds me of the chanaglouglou one from that angle 👀😂🔥
Admin can you do that?
The ball➡️↗️↘️↗️
🎵 It's a knuckleball 🎵
This reminds me of the freekick of Calhanoglu of Hamburg against Dortmund. It was the first ever knuckleball goal I watched. I do miss sometimes those days of Bundesliga, but always is a good league to watch.
Damn.
Similar goal to what Onana conceded against forest. Them shots are very tricky
❤
I was at that match!!!!
Crazy
As a goalkeeper, I hate those spins. It keeps making me confused.
GK dancing with the ball
Frist pin ❤
