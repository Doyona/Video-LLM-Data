Thank you for all the love 🤍
3:27 👀😮😊🌞👏👏👏
A masterpiece
safado cafajeste
Oh my god this sounds so much like red swan 😭
I've just discovered her music today and I've been listening to all her songs for last  four hours and i can't get enough it's so beautiful and lyrics are so relatable. I'm loving it.
God I love this song and the music video. Plus WILLIAM GAO! I'm in love
Why were they making out?
I happened across this two days ago. Shame to say, I had never heard of you! But this....this is poetry, magic. All my love from Scotland, you really are spectacular, original and full of the whimsy I think we all need in life
this is very painful ,💔
she probaply wont reply, but I will really appreciate it if someone can tell me where can I get that black jacket she is wearing in :1:13
Its so heartbreaking on how this is exactly my love story of a crush 💔
i'm throwing up and sobbing laufey wth
Ever since this song came out I always thought of how similar the piano on the background sounded to red swan from aot AND NOW WE HAVE A REMIX HELLO???
RED SWAN?!?!? dude the piano sound like RED SWAN FROM AOT DUDE
Hey so I’m a young fan is this ok to watch😀..
BRO WHO TF BROKE UP WITH HER
Omg I don't know if anyone is going to see this, but the first time I watched this video with my friend, the "casual" music video played right afterwards and we thought it was part of the mv. 😭
i’m going to her concert in october and i’m telling you ill be singing and crying during this song
How did I just find out there’s a music video??!!! ITS BEAUTIFUL
so peak♥️
The guy I was with only ever talked about how beautiful I am on the outside. But not once has he ever talked about my personality unless I asked him to. I really felt when laufey said “I can’t even tell who you want to know.” I’m so much more than what people see on the outside. Hopefully I’ll find a man who will see my inner beauty too. Thank you laufey for helping me realize that I’m worth so much more than what men think I do🤍
CHILLS CHILLS  ༼⁠;⁠´⁠༎ຶ⁠ ⁠۝ ⁠༎ຶ⁠༽✋
So beautiful
❤❤❤
I work in downtown Brooklyn and this was filmed less than half a mile from where I work! What a treat it is to be a NYC Lauver 🎉
Iloveyouuuuu!!!
Celine Song the GOAT
so this hurts!
Don't cry, honey. 😢🫂
WHO HURT YOUUU GANG I GOTTA TELL PALPATINE ABOUT HIM THE EMPIRE DOES NOT TOLERATE TS‼️ -Darth Vader
kesini gara gara live streamnya sunpowrr
3:36 its my favourite part
She is amazing lovely music for the ears ❤
Just wonderful, for you're a goddess, and I might add very gorgeous 😍  !!! Peace ✌️ and Love ❤️
"Guess you're still growing up at 30" 😮
Generation Alfa’s “I Dreamed a Dream.”
BEST !
💟💞🆒🖒☺🙂💙💌😻
I relate to this song as a trans person 😢
I am just shocked of how many of us women have not said no to these circumstances. And how many men love to see us perfect and when we are not we are just an ending line in a book...
Was the guy an  Ashian guy?Asian don't do this!Chinese don't do things like this!Chinese guys fall hard!!!
You are beautiful!YOU ARE A GODDESS.I REGONIZE YOU !!!LISTEN TO ME !!!
Im sorry to flex to those who havent heard her yet. This is the best live. There is no words for it.
oh laufey.. :( ❤
3:36 a parte que você está esperando
goddess already 1 year ago??!!
I absolutely love her raw emotion at 4:10  Its so powerful
WILLIAM GAO THO 🥹
Your voice reminds me of Jo Stafford. https://youtu.be/zQfF84ackMM
video: amazing live chat: screaming like button: pressed ears blessed: yes
Te amo laufey
😏👌
gonna perform this in  my school’s talent show next year ❤
THE SILVER LINING DRESS AT 0:40?!?!?
❤
This is so “Notting Hill” coded omg, love it
A song about how deception and love is a cruel formula for a lifelong regret.
Set you free this time and Have you seen her face are two Byrds that can be reacted to. 😊
it's okay Laufey ily
↖️👸🇯🇵goddessも同じ✨✨✨
I love the photography in this (short) movie.
It’s so early and I got school soon, but I’m glad I woke up 😭❤️
Love Laufey!!
MY GOD THIS IS PERFECT ❤
Perfect 😍
3:35 at full volume, I was LEVITATING
It's been a long time since a song has taken my breath away like this did. The tenderness, the builds, this is an absolute masterpiece. Forever sad I can never listen to it for the first time again
pura hermosura auditiva :´3
Laufey ef þú sérð þetta comment sem er ekki líklegt geturu commentað á það pg besti binur minn f***** elskar þig þu ert best❤❤❤
Whoever hurt laufey... Count your days...I LOVE YOU LAUFEY!!!!❤❤❤❤❤😢
love
te re doy laufey rica hermosa 😍😍😍😍😍😍
✨
🩵your song
Can i see the gut atleast laufey stop gate keeping
YOUUUU TOOK MEER FOR A FOOOL
LAUFEY I AM SO SHOCKED THIS IS SUCH A BANGER NO WONDER ITS NAMED GODESS... ❤
so sensible, so gentle, so raw... amazing.
Again and again
Laufey ate with this one
Just discovered Laufey today and this is instantly my favorite song. The piano melody immediately made me think of Red Swan by YOSHIKI and HYDE. I wonder if that was what she sampled or took inspiration from but either way this song is amazing.
WHYS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT HOW SUCH BEAUTIFUL THIS IS???
This song hits hard. Incredible music. I got emotional listening to this. Thank you for sharing this with the world. I’ve been listening to this song on repeat for the last hour. I hope you find happiness again Laufey, but in the meantime, thank you for this as well. I hope it was healing for you to write this 😭
i love how when she becomes a 'goddess', the scene around her isn't extravagant. showing thats its not her.
i thought in the bridge part of the song he would push him away😟 but the vocals? SLAYED
I love it
absolute goddess
Word!
I could write a thousand words to explain how heavenly sorrowful this song is. From the lyrics, melody, and the voice behind this song, just Wow
What an artist, guys
I adore you. Greetings from Argentina
Just saw you on First Take. How did I not hear you before? You're amazing.
This song man...
4:14 my fav part❤
This song becomes even more stunning and heartbreakingly beautiful every time i hear it ❤️
this completly destroyed me
3:53 just no words
THIS IS ART!!! THIS IS LAUFEY
this is a work of art. I can't even can imagine me living in a world without this fucking song. laufey is a real artist and deserve all the good things in this world. you are my biggest inspiration ❤
i see this video as the feeling of lust from the perspective of the victim. they didn’t want this, but they ended up destroyed and devastated, physically and mentally. i think most people can relate to this not in the visual depiction, but in the sense of how vulnerability can really damage you if you become too fragile, and we can see this here where Laufey’s character gets taken advantage of by this love interest character. when the scene finishes, her figure (or what i depict as the character’s soul) has silver bruising and barren trees around her, displaying how she was hurt by this interaction. the crying at the end of the video can signify weeping and trauma, which everyone will face at some point in their life.

This video has me sobbing but also isn’t Laufey a Icelandic goddess
her voice is so heavenly omg 😭❤
This song is the definition of 'underated'. Why the hell a Lauver has to go through from the start, falling behind, santa baby,... before they get the chance to listen to this masterpiece
STOPPP SHE IS SO GENIUS!!
her voice is like a warm hot chocolate on a cold winter day
Está es mi canción favorita de laufey
MR. WILLIAM GAO
I love this song, it's so beautiful and raw.   But the lyrics cringe me hard bc it's a topic that's completely unrelatable in a literal sense unless you're also a famous performer lol
This is not for kids
bro everything about this wrecks me
essa musica sendo a maior q temos da diva ate entao nem amo vey
AHH I LOVE THIS SONG QUEEN LAUFEYYY 🙇‍♀️
what if he just left to get you food :3
DONT PUT A DIRTY OF UR FINGERS ON MY GIRLY POP
a funeral can't make me cry but THIS CAN?
It's a very nice bae❤
When I heard this music for the first time, I felt all the pain that music brings. but seeing this video clip, it's just a pure work of art. Everything is perfect, the clip makes you feel even more things. It’s a work of art, well done laufey!!
this song shot me, stabbed me, punched me then kissed me on the forehead
Why love a goddess, when you don't treat her like one?
Oh my god! It’s so fucking good that made me out of breath.
ooooh pedrada
Laufey is so beautiful
damn Will! ❤
incredible detail that the dress she's wearing in the lyric video is on the floor beside the bed 😭
Isabella Boylston!
This music touched my heart laufey i will forever love you 😢
Te amo
ts magnicent asf😢😢 (all the glaze in the world)

I sob when he started to undress and was pinning down and undressing laufey I don't know it just broke my heart..
Never let a man make you feel like your not beautiful. You are x
This song sounds so traumatic
Napakasakit putragis
The magnolia reference makes this hurt even more
This is such a good song one of the people in my music class was singing it bc we were just practicing and they sang the song and then hair is just so much emotion at 3:28and it just continues great song well done
seeing laufey cry made me ache all over.·´¯`(>▂<)´¯`·.
the way i would die hearing this song live 😭
lord protect this woman from evil asian men
Me, throwing down my headphones and going over to kick the fridge cus this made me cry. Wow! This was deep.... (no fridge was hurt during the unfolding of this episode, my toes?....welp.)

🌻🌻
Laufey I love you for creating music like this
What is this. How does this exist. This is such an amazing song. The structure of the music video. Laufey's voice is amazing. It's going to so many places. This song is so personal. This doesn't exist and never was created. Thank you Laufey.
Me trying to act mysterious knowing I almost cried to this song:
Bro i almost cry because of this song
Laufeyy eu te amoo❤❤❤😭😭😭
Goddess is such an emotioanl song, it's just amazing.
This video choreography along with your singing really makes this a Disney music scene with you as it’s princess but ten times better 🤍  Just absolutely beautiful Miss Laufey ☺️
Beautiful song, heartbreaking video.
At first I heard it I was like “I would rather your song called from the start” and then I listened to it more and it was a BOP you hear me???
This is incredible
Had a great opportunity to watch her sing this live in Manila the other night and they way she belted the bridge part gave me goosebumps. Such a core memory of Laufey.
Her tears :(
I knew you from Tiktok
The most disgusting part in 3:06
omg this song is so beautiful
COME THO ANGOLAA FOR ME PLS😭😭💗💗
SEE YOU TOMORROW LAUFEY
🥹🥹🥹🥹 Aphrodite, can't Sing a song like this 😢😢😢😢

Dont you notice how I get quiet when there's no one else around me and you and awkward silence Don't you dare look at me that way. -laufey from the beginning
Laufey you are already a goddess like who agrees??
First time you hear that banger : « What a great romantic song ! » Then you pay attention to the lyrics thoroughly and it hurts very bad… 🥲
im ugly crying because of thisss
She sounds like a disney princess

someone please give laufey a HUGGGG!!!! 😫🥲
I love laufey.
Great song!❤❤
Why does the guy look like Jackie Tran from dhar Mann 💀😭
SLAY
jesus christ is laufey attracted to people with narcissistic personality disorder or people with psychopathic tendencies
Wow, Laufey, you never cease to amaze me!  Your voice is heavenly and the lyrics here are so true. I was a singer in my younger days and know this feeling you are singing about.   Keep doing what you´re doing, you are so good at it!
Love this song
MAN this is just like how skibidi toilet said it man
came for an AMAZING laufey song, stayed for will gao. this video is a masterpiece omg
Omg i feel that I just witnessed a born of a timeless STAR💫!!!!! Thank you for your uniqueness we need more artists like you 🥹🤍

1. where is my mind 2. where is my mind 3. where is my mind 4. where is my mind 5. where is my mind
She is a Siren
ykw i might cry
laufey, you dont know me but your music brought me through the worst time of my life. You are such an inspiration! Love your music
Idk why am crying,i haven't even been in love before but i understand this very well 😭
Sounds like a lullaby
Such a fun song and video! Happy to discover your music, keep it coming!
The first time I saw and heard this on MTV Live I was like, what. You know what, it grew quickly on me and everytime I hear it, I have to stop what I am doing and watch or listen to it.  There is something with this song that draws a person in and stays in your head.  Such a beautiful song.  :)
Don't get why baddies give chances to cunts and come back here to cry whilst listening to laufey😭😭
I love You Laufey ❤
Every time I hear the song, I remember (red swan) from Attack on Titan EVERY TIME
I really really love ur music
I LOVE YOU LAUFEY OMG
I needed this one, thankyou
[Lyrics]: It always goes like this Could've predicted it I'm so naive to think you loved me for me Kissed as I ran off stage Too old to play this game Guess you're still growing up at thirty Oh  Were you surprised by me When you took me home? When the glamor wore off Reduced to skin and bone I can't even tell Who you want to know I'm a goddess on stage Human when we're alone  You took a star to bed Woke up with me instead You must have felt so damn deceived When you made up a version of Me that you thought you'd love But I am not your Aphrodite Oh  Were you surprised by me When you took me home?  When the glamor wore off Reduced to skin and bone I can't even tell Who you want to know I'm a goddess on stage Human when we're alone  You took me for a fool You stole my youth You wanted this so much You watched me rise Then killed my light And now you know I'm not your fucking goddess Oh, oh I'm no goddess when I'm alone
I really hope this song isn’t about experiences that Laufey has gone through
I'm going to disagree! You are definitely a goddess. That VOICE.... amazing!
We need this queen in movies, such a beautiful actress and singer
3:27 has to be the best part
Elska þig Laufey
Didn't expect to hear f- word in jazz songs but it comes out soooo good
William Gao what are you doing here???!!! 😭😭😭
音良いな
"you took me for a fool you stole my youth you wanted this so much you watched me rise then killed my light"  those words are the most painful feeling and I completely understand... thank you for making that pain into the most comforting and realistic song. I love this song dearly.
im sobbing
SHE SAID A SWEAR WORD!  I HEARD WORDS FROM A WISE MAN THAT SWEAR WORDS SHOULDNT BE IN THE SONG UNLESS ITS IMPORTANT TO THE MESSAGE OR ADDS TO THE FEELINGS. THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW TO USE SWEAR WORDS JN A SONG
Wow
WILL GAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
This came on my bday!!! Tysm Laufy love you so much
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I was doing so well so well separating myself then she said the part about how he stole her youth and I lost. lol I'm not crying! You're crying!
your art should be such a gift for  human soul
Siern❤
Dammit this song is so beautiful and i hits me deep that im crying😭
Cool Audrey Plaza makes music videos now. 😅
Nice
I felt that! Damn 😢😭
I listen to that song while in the toilets, cool ambiance
Stunning
WILL GAO?!! OMG!!!
God what a gorgeous, heartbreaking song ❤
❤❤❤
Nah Don't touch her
IM CRYING :((✨✨
I kind of identify with this song, not in the romantic way, but when someone puts a expectation that's related to a religious figure on you and you aren't what they tought you would be
que mujer
WILL GAO OML
I LOVE YOU LAUFEY 😭🤍
Laufey when I catch the man you wrote this song about it’s on sight girl😔😔😔🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️

This music video just adds salt to the wound from listening to this heart wrenching ballad.
Laid flat on my bed, put on my headphones, closed my eyes, and played this. I’ve found my new favorite thing to do.
Laufey. This ate😭(please give me free concert tickets 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏)
Laufey*

Superbe belle voix j'adore ce morceau 🌹
Laufey is literally a GODDESS 🤍 Her music is like HEAVEN 🤍 Her voice makes me feel like I'm floating on a CLOUD 🤍 We love Laufey !! 🤍🤍
xd
"Guess you're still growing up at thirty" ...
Just heard this on the Jamie Cullum jazz show, amazing song!
this song sort of makes me think of Louis and Rowan from "The Art of Pleasing Princes"
laufey its your song why are you not ther not your sister junialin but i will fell disgust if somen was kising me like that end i know becouse  junialin has curly hair end yours is't but i still lovet
You're amazing Laufey! I don't know if it's just me but I'm getting some Attack On Titan's Red Swan OP vibes, especially with the melody.
3:34 is best part
your all songs make my mind peace🤧💗💗💗
Listen from 0:00 to 4:50
LAUFEY I DONT HATE YOU I LOVE YOU IM TRYING TO GO TO YOUR EVENT ON SEPTEMBER MONDAY IN MANILA
arrasa muito diva 💗💗💗
i love how you can see celine’s style through this, she has such a distinctively beautiful style of directing.
I LOVE LAUFEY.
i’m so confused, what just happened.’m
“You took me for a fool” hits me hard
Such amazing!
this song hit me so hard.
😍😍😍
Her voice is so powerful,i might become a fan
The way the camera is kinda shaking is make this mv more good.
the ending is transcendental
Это отлично.
i just started listening to you like 5 mins ago and i’m already in love with ur music it’s so smooth and calm ☺️ It’s calms me down when i’m having panic and anxiety attacks tysm!❤
3:33 thank you for this song.  And I love you.
I interpret this song in such a different way with the same meaning. Instead of fame and glory being adored, in my previous relationship love and happiness was adored.  Our relationship was "perfect" but since we got into small fights he kept mentioning that he doesnt feel the love like before. During those fights we were reduced to skin and bone, I loved him when he no longer shined like a star instead he was just a meteor. His dents and craters became more visible than ever and so were mine. I loved him despite not being a star but he no longer loved me after finding out I wasn't one either.  Was displaying my brightest hues deceiving? Is that why you left? You could no longer love me after knowing I'm human was that it? Yet you took me for a fool letting me love you to the fullest while you watch me and thought to yourself I'm not happy anymore I'm not a perfect partner or person I'm not a fn goddess can't you understand?
zelda
Thank you so much for your beautiful music
I love u laufey ❤️
what is this

Woooww ✨️✨️✨️
DONT YOU DARE!!!!!
chills honestly
Just saw you , at the Wang , with my 26 y.o. daughter and we were completely and thoroughly mesmerized the entire evening!  Your music: lyrics, jazzy smooth vocals, the incredible ensemble of musicians, and your extraordinary instrumental talent with guitars,piano, and cello!!!!! At a time when my 💜 is full of sadness for the communities in Israel and Gaza , you provided several hour’s of complete JOY and LOVE !Thank you, Laufey!
I luv this song
Nurhasan bin Abdulaziz al-Saud ⭐🇲🇨
THIS IS A CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE
I love how the lyrics changed from “when we’re alone” to “when I’m alone”
❤👍
Did anyone else feel like the cinematography and later half of the video gave the vibe of the Sergei Paranjov,s film “The colour of pomegranates”
I mean, the artistry of this song is on a different level!
They did the BOOMBAYAH 😢
This is the most honest song ever written and it is so beautifully and lyrically put together it’s an absolute masterpiece
YOU TOOK ME FOR A FOOL🗣️🗣️
such a beautiful music video
MASTERPIECE EVERYTHING THE SONG THE VIDEO EVERYTHING!!! LAUFEY🔛🔝
😢❤❤❤
3:24 is literally so beautiful..
This is just so ✨ luvv uu laufey thank you for making this song
Beautiful, cinematic <3 <3
Goddess on AND off stage. Period.
Is that Junia?!!
WHAT DO YOU MEAN A LAUFEY MUSIC VIDEO DIRECTED BY CELINE SONG STARING WILL AND LAUFEY WHAT DO YOU MEEEEEEEEEAN
Good ✨
vou dar a nota no letterboxd
I honestly feel like I just went through heartbreak and something traumatizing but I loved it
WILL GAO OMG
I don't know why, but I feel like this is Junia😢
LAUFEY BABY WHO HURT YOU GIVE ME NAMES
This song made me cry the music video 10x worse it’s so beautiful
real
WILL AND LAUFEY OMG! I'm in love 🤍
Copiou imaculada!!!
laufey music is just 500 hundred days of summer istg.
Omg❤❤❤❤
laufey anak gondes kahh
please tell me the meaning of the lyric?
I love this song huhuu
I EXPECTED A LOVEY DOVEY SONG HELLO??  NOT A 4 MINUTES THERAPY SESSION
I really like Laufey's voice and compositions.    But, I don't understand why she feels the need to include vulgar slang in the lyrics.   Anyone?    To me, the F bomb in a lovely song like this is an act of violence against the listener.
omg wait... in Magnolia, Laufey talks about wanting beauty, and love, and at 3:25, she's crying, while surrounded by Magnolia... Maybe she's saying she found what she was searching for, but it wasn't what she expected 🤔
😮😮😮 no hay palabras para definir lo que sentí al escuchar tu canción, solo se que es hermosa tu interpretación movio todos mis sentidos, gracias por compartirnos tu talento❤❤❤
Just found you.... Just WOW!!!🤯... love when you go full 'Matt Bellamy' with the harmonies at 3:36 🎹
THE LYRICS BE HITTIN HARDDD
So beautiful song❤
You know, the thing is, it's a nice song with beautiful vocals, but that chord progression at the climax still reminds me of Radiohead's 'Creep' .
🤩🤩
Please, do not lose your true essence and originality, do not give in to the industry, that is all we ask.
That made me cry 😭😭
That's going to be my favourite song for a long time
laufey this music video is so cinematic 😭 i hope i can see you someday
oh my god this song is amazing laufey
Hi Laufey Can you come to Vietnam travel <3 Love from all my country send to you
I’m freaking sobbing!!!
Wait did laufey's  ex did the 69 with her tyen broke up with her?  Bc if thats true thats so messed up
im just gonna say i cried even more than when i first listened to it
😢
Laufey is one of the most pleasant surprise I’ve received in the past year. Absolute masterclass of an artist ❤
Me screaming at my phone: NO LAUFEY!!! DONT DO IT!! HES GONNA BREAK YOUR HEART!!!
i love locofake
I love you please don't die

LAUFEY WHO HURT YOU LIKE THIS
i wish that he could see the damage he did to me. everything i gave to him, i let him destroy every single part of me, i let him do it because i thought i could heal him if i let him do it. why couldnt he change. why couldnt he be better for me. why did he do that to me. why

This is poetry for my ears ❤
I discovered Laufey with a TikTok ad. Finally my use of this app has given me something good 😅.
LOVE U LAUFEY
@3:29 MY HEART SANK OMG
this is the best song in the world and the official music video is so cool
huuuuuuuy TTTT.TTTT I really love this song, the lyrics are so damn amazing and beautiful... and now i'm sadddd
I LOVE ITTT
Genuinely CRYING because of how relatable this music video and your song, is. I’m in my 20s as well, just turned 23. I’m also aware of how it feels, to date an older man.
I love this song so much
I’m so glad that I’m a lauvers I listen to ur songs like everyday when I come home from school.
Qué te hicieron Laufey 😭
goosebumps.
please release villain too😭😭 been supporting you when youre still starting. rly loved it when you posted it in your story. too bad i didnt get to record it.
JUST WOW
Te amooooo Laufey!!!
It may sound really weird but I can relate this song to my dad (NOT THE ROMANTIC/SEXUAL PARTS). My dad thought I was this perfect person who would grow up in his image but when I began developing my personality I was rejected and punished for it. I don’t think he saw me as human or a young child. He even isolated me from my siblings by telling me and them that I was his favorite. I was basically the girl version of him. “You stole my youth. You wanted this so much. You watched me rise and killed my light.” This is how I feel. I separated from him and he passed away and I grew into a person who strayed even further from his dream for me. I think if he was alive, he’d hate me. “And now you know I’m not your fucking goddess.” Is what I think when that thought crosses my mind. I honestly think it’s a good thing I don’t know what he would think.
My god your voice is so angelic can you do a collaboration with aurora?
THE CHILLS THIS GAVE ME IS UNREAL
This girl is going to be the next global superstar
Eres realmente tan bonita 💗
Te amo laufey 💗
I just noticed that the chords are the same as Red Swan (an Aot op) and that just makes love this song so much more ❤
what tf did i just witness
NO BUT U NEED TO BE MORE FAMOUS. LIKE GIRL U SOUND SO GOOD
OMGOSH I LOVE IT 💗💗💗
that's a masterpiece
Omg 👍🏽🥹
God, she's gorgeous
So many emotions I am feeling right now. This is the most beautiful thing I have ever heard.
god.
Ew a smoker, don’t date a smoker when you have such a beautiful voice, that shit will take it away.
I love youuuuuu!!!😭🙏
this song pierces my heart, her lyricism is absolutely beautiful. i'm so glad i know about her music, i hope i can see her live someday.

my lou fey
idc if laufey isnt a goddess. she looks like one, sounds like one, and her songwriting is heavenly.
Hi
“You took a star to bed, woke up with me instead. You must have felt so damn deceived.” Reality be hitting hard sometimes.
LAUFEY GRACIAS POR TANTO PERDON POR TAN POCO :'v
TE AMO LAUFEY
this is beautiful, I’ve never sobbed more
Absolutely beautiful. Wow.
oh I love this so much
Seeing her tears of pain breaks my heart. 😢 Such a raw, touching song.
Laufey is the only artist I know that music actually makes sense and helps me understand.
The little smirk after the tear is amazing my friend! Good job on the video!
GO BAD BITCH YOU ARE SO AMAZING❤❤❤❤
Such a Nice Music vidéo ✨
OMGG I LOVE THIS SONG OMGG ❤❤❤
oh wow..
I love this song so muchhhhhhhh🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷
What a beautiful song. I Loved the way it sounded but it sounded like the base was overblown when using surround 7.1, other than that it sounded so beautiful.
Te adoro   eres una persona  muy  linda y te admiro mucho  me encantó  la canción  me iso  llorar  😢 gracias  por todas las canciones
Que vibe maravilhosa.
A melhor parte do video está entre 0:00 ÷ 4:50 ☆
SHE JUST ENDED THIS MANS WHOLE CAREER AND I LOVE IT
One music video that portraits a lot of her songs
oh my god i didnt recognize him until i came to the comments.
Laufeyyyyy you’re  so talented
literally one of the best bridges ever ❤
goddess indeed
Limerence vs real love
So today is the day I cry
You have me in f*cking tears!!!!…thanks for your beautiful song and for sharing this moment. Much love to you!!! ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
From 3:39 onwards is the most beautiful, strong and powerful from Laufey. Stunning!
I LOVE YOU LAUFEY IM YOUR #1 FAN AND IM SO EXCITED FOR YOUR GODDESS TOUR HERE IN NYC. I WAS OVERJOYED SHEN I GOT TICKETS SEND YOU LOTS OF LOVE ❤️❤️🩷🩷

Perfect timing Laufey, I needed this- I felt every peace of this
No idealices a nadie
CANNOT believe Celine Song did this music video. she is a MASTER. This is amazing Laufey <3
like the definition of ethereal
EARLY :D
ARGHHHHH WILL GAOOO
The amount of times I’ve listened to this is uncountable. I love you so much Laufey
TAO?? From heartstopper?!
I don't know how Laufey hits all the notes I want them to hit.. like...damn a f*cking goddess in my ears
LAUFEY you are the reason the world spins. i actually cannot do this anymore

Not even exaggerating- when I saw her cry I started sobbing
Umm so I am very upset my wife LAUFEY was with this guy more than me but that’s ok she made this great song in exchange.
🖤
Who is the guy? 😭
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOO TF MADE HERRRRRRRRRRRR SAAADDDDDDDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Laufey girl you never fail to amaz me, I'm obsessed with this every song Is perfection I love you so much ❤️
Gorgeous 🎶👌🏼👌🏼❤️
OMG
Cada día me hace más feliz que esté creciendo tanto 😿, está canción está hermosa me hace sentir cosas que no se pueden ni siquiera explicar, como cada canción que escucho de esta hermosa mujer 💗
this video made me cry uncontrollably and im not sure why, but i love all of ur work sm 💗
I love you Laufey. I met the light when I first heard your music and you cure my depression and my fractured knee, then I showed your music to my half sister and she started flying in the air until she became a bird, I've never seen her since but I hope she's somewhere else listeing to this banger. Stay safe ilysm 🙏🏻💗
WILL GAO AND LAUFEY WHAT
and now im supose find love in normale life ?
This song is incredible, the video is everything
laufey laying🧍🏻‍♀️😀
im actually so upset, I was supposed to go to the Toronto concert but my friend couldnt make it 😭 Anywayss I showed my brother Laufey and he loved it lmao
new fave song
WHY AM I CRYING WHY WHAT OMG
mi cancion favorita, y el video esta hermoso
TAO WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE??
"You took me for a fool You stole my youth You wanted this so much You watched me rise Then killed my light"  My goddess, have I done something to offend you? I feel like something has awakened and died inside of me at the same time.
I wasn't ready for the lyrics 😭😭😭
why is this 20 hours long
ok but the screen at 3:35 and the lyric ‘you took my youth’ low-key reminds me of yellow jackets. I know this song and the snow are nothing alike contextually but the visuals look like when the girls are all in their spiritual attire and the crash quite literally did ‘take their youth’
Guau, su voz es tan fuerte o profunda, es dificil describirla. Luego regreso, iré a buscar una traducción!
I love laufey with every fibre of my being hearing her voice brings a smile to my face and joy to my heart i wish her nothing but love and all the happiness in the world.<3
🙏🏼 I’ve been listening to this song on repeat since it came out to remember the words
ILYSM LAUFEY❤
I love the room aesthetic so much this is so off topic AND THE  MV IS AMAZING!!
This is ✨ beautiful ✨ ✨perfect✨ And every beautiful word in the world
TOO GOOD.
This is a true masterpiece 💖💖💖💖💖💖😈

i fw you heavy
I LOVE HER SO MUCH EEEEEEEK
iloveeyouuu my goddess
i am so not normal for laufey
LAUFEY WITH WILL GAO!?
Why am I crying
Laufey what happened to the bewitched goddess edition countdown on Spotify😨😨 my life is surrounded around that countdown, I check it every day😭😭
Something I notice with this is that not once while they’re together in her room do they kiss - such a passionate moment, without a single moment of real passion
OHH I GOT IT NOW 😭
THIS WAS AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE
i love you
CHAO LITERALMENTE DESCRIBISTE MI SITUACION NO PUEDO VOY A LLORAR
God this is just to good
WHOEVER MADE HER CRY IRL COUNT YOUR DAYS
TE AMO LAUNDRY
Her just sitting there waiting for him is so violating in such a simple way
IM LOSING IT IM LDOASEG
Encantada com essa canção 😍🥰
i love you laufey
This MV is EVERYTHING ❤
THE SCREAM I SCREMPT WHEN I SAW WILL GAO OH MY GOOD STOP.THIS IS BEAUTIFUL OH MY GD LAUFEY I LOVE YOU THIS IS BEAUTIFUL THAHNKY OUW
bye this is the most beautiful things i’ve ever seen
just went to her concert!! it was amazing
I can relate with the song, but not as her... But as the person she sings to. I put him on a pedestal... It must have hurt him. Now that I'm away from that I feel bad and I'm scared of loving (romantically) someone again.
I LOVE U LAUFEY
brilliant video
WILLIAM GAO
if you just watched the video and you're scrolling through the comments, go restart the video. It makes sense when you watch it again!
jesus christ laufey this is haunting in such a good way
omg this is a masterpiece also at 3:31 did anyone else feel like laufey’s outfit was intentionally designed to look like a costume to symbolize the false “goddess” persona or is that just me 😮
HERMOSO VÍDEO, HERMOSA MELODÍA, HERMOSA LAUFEY ♥♥
You look so pretty ❤
que arte
OMG TAO!!!!??

Queen ate the whole milkyway with this video
you’re so amazing laufey. i love u soso much ❤️
AMOO
CURLEY HAIR LAUFEY!!!! 🫶🫶🔛🔝🥰🥰🥰
this perfectly captures my first relationship and it makes me sad thinking back but it‘s also so beautiful to see this experience validated. I tried to feed into this impression he had of me even though I knew I couldn‘t live up to it in the long term. Even though I felt that I was losing myself along the way. I was so scared that if I showed up as myself, in all my vulnerability and humanness, he wouldn‘t want me anymore
So beautiful ❤ 😭
WOWWWWW
Always love laufey's song, I always listen to your playlist to study <3
Oh my God the straight feels I get from this😭
omg will gao
this is everything😘
I FUCKING LOVE LAUFEY
Stop I love you laufey 😭🙏

all the lauvers freaking out in the live chat and laufey just goes "yay!" 😭  (at 2:22 lol)
This entire music video game me goosebumps. Laufey truly is so underrated
this song scares me about her past. I really pray she has healed or is healing on whatever hurt her so  much
Keep it up Laundry🥳

Depresion
WHO HURT U WHO WAS IT
So gorgeously heartbreaking. Reminds me of the ending of the "honeymoon" phase...how we hold each other on these unrealistic pedestals...
Will Gao from Wasia did great. I'm excited for the tour!
it's junia in the video
🩶
wow.......... I cried watching this
LIVE LAUGH LOVE LAUFEY
LAUFEYYY OMG YOU GOT ME CRYING WHYYY
thank you for this song
BEUTIFULLLLL!! OMFGGGG
El video musical de "Laufey - Goddess" muestra la historia de una mujer que se da cuenta de que no es una diosa cuando está sola, sino simplemente humana. La letra de la canción habla sobre la decepción y la pérdida de identidad en una relación. La protagonista reflexiona sobre cómo la persona que amaba la transformó en algo que no era.
Laufey,   it's so incredible seeing you be so successful and in your element. Even though we were never really close at Berklee, I always knew you had an incredible voice since I saw your video your posted on your Facebook.   You inspire me more and more with each time I see you to build my own music career. Keep on shining ❤
Damm, laufey had the femme fatale (or homme fatale??man grupie??) experience
Why do you always like twinks loofey❤
Laufey has such a beautiful eye for creativity and expression with her songs truly sending a message🤍
You don't know how much i love U ❤😢
ily so much ❤
БРАВО!
No me pongan esa que lloro
This made me cry at 1:43 AM in the Philippines. 💔💔💔

TAO XU IS GLOWING UP SO FAST
Her crying at the end made me cry I’ve been made fun of for crying to this song because it’s just a song but this has so much behind it and I love all these songs you have made you’re an amazing person laufey we love you‼️‼️💗💗
te amo
Laufey...would be a goddess everywhere...
this doesn't really have that much to do with the song (which is INCREDIBLE btw), but seeing Laufey with her natural hair is so refreshing to me! I have very curly hair, and i'm always worried that it looks messy or bad because there's always a lot of loose strands here and there, but seeing the clip not only showing but highlighting the same thing on her with the lighting made me realize that it actually looks really nice! Laufey's really beautiful after all lol
I camw here from the balls video
💗💗💗
they kinda look like siblings ahahaha
came here for Will Gao and was slapped with the visuals AND HIM and this emotional song goddam
Well, I liked the video as soon as I started it, and I enjoyed every second as I'd expected.
I LOOOOVVEEEEEE UUUU
WAIT I JS REALIZED THAT FLOWERS AT THE END REPRESENTS MAGNOLIA????????? do you see what i see????????!!!!!!!
Сук она в кокошнике
Absolutely perfect in every way!!!!
FINALLY YAYYY

this is pure art. wow i‘m speechless honestly wow.
OMGGGGG
OMMMMM ❤

Just after our break up, this song was released. somehow, even i dont quite relate to it, this song helped me cope with the pain a lot. I’m very thankful to artists like Laufey. Much love!!

What does the outfit at the ens symbolize when laufey is crying?  At 3:53, I know the flowers are magnolias and references from that song based on what another comment has said, but what does the outfit mean? Especially the makeup?

WILL GAO AND LAUFEY WHAAAAATT??? OMGG
Realmente ella tiene toda la razón, siempre tomamos a los artistas como dioses, y ellos también son humanos, también necesitan cariño y tienen depresión, tienen emociones, pueden enojarse, o reír, porque no están obligados a tener que ser dioses sin emociones, son humanos cuando están solos. Cómo fans debemos entenderlos, pero mayormente les exigimos cosas imposibles, o nos decepcionamos de su simple lado humano. Es tan triste escuchar esta melodía, saber que el glamour también se reduce a piel y huesos, tanta razón tiene nuestra estrella, que no es estrella sino una humana que tiene muchísimo talento, es famosa, y más que nada, también tiene sueños y emociones. Gracias por este gran tema Laufey.
PERFEITA
amazing  🤍🤍
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH P
Thank you, so much.

Hey uhhh Imma have to ask the guy to back up!
This was…. Breathtaking. 😫😭😭❤️❤️ i was mesmerized the whole time

The way I just got out of the psych ward and this song just threw me off my rocker but in a heavenly and bittersweet way
Laufey why?😢
my life without laufey was terrible
God gave her the mission to serve, but Laufey choose to ate
TAO WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE

Isn't this guy from wasia project
aw laufey who hurt you 💛
goat
Did you guys notice the difference in their show choice and how it was shown in the video?  Laufey has very small and delicate shoes while the guy has dominant boots and I feel like that was a very incredible that helps us realize the magnitude of this amazing video
I keep relatingy
eu vou morar aqui.
honestly tired of these love songs
3:35 genuinely made me tear up... incredible.

i love this song and the last scene but i cant lie, i was so distracted by how gentle will was being 😔
chills. literal chills. I love you Laufey this is beautiful <3
this reminds me so much of lore olympus, specifically persephone and appollo
Laufey Darling you are pure art
Love the Cinematography and composition, directed by Celine Song just reminds me of Past Lives, one of my favorite movie of all time + the music just gave me goosebumps after countless times listening to this.
This video is so gorgeous ❤❤❤❤
LAUFEY ME DESTRUISTE 😭😭
Duele sentirse en los zapatos de alguien... y duele más saber que ese dolor no será conocido
William Gao maravilhosoooo amazing ❤❤❤

Diva demais!!!❤
LAUFEY COME TO BRAZIL PLEASE
This is a masterpiece! The song and video!! Laufey you never miss 😭🤩
OMG ITS SO GOOD
Gives me a radiohead vibe. Some chord changes remind me of Creep and then others like something off A Moon Shaped Pool.
LAUFEY WILL GAO AND CELINE SONG??????????????? the best combination EVER
Love you ❤
I started crying when the tears were running down your face 4:17 😢
That's just so deep... the fact everything is going so slow, every gaze... and then it just burns in the end. Everything seems so peaceful, but at the same time it feels like a lot of things is just boiling inside and you can't throw them off properly. So it keeps stuck.
LAUFEY OMG I'M SOBBING 😭😭
LAUFEY
I love all her little details she adds, she never fails to impress. THE LITERAL DEPTH OF THIS VID HITS SO HARD 😫
MY MOM WALKED IN MY ROOM WHILE I WAS WATCHING THE BED SCENE AND NOW IM GROUNDED FOR A WEEK😭😭😭😭😭
جميلة كالعادة😭❤❤❤❤✨
i love this :(
Me encantaaaaaa
the visuals, the lyrics... everything is just so spotless. she definitely deserves another grammy.
Laufey is an example of music being art.
I saw Björk for a moment in the clip.
*causally drops the saddest song/video ever*
IT SHOULDVE BEEN ME NOT HIM!!!!
❤️❤️
I love Laufey's voice and music and everything.  Can't help but notice one thing about the videography of the 3rd verse. The final climax is huge and dramatic musically, and offers huge contrast to verse 1 and 2. But the videography stayed at the same low-key level, if not reduced to be even more passive in nature. I wished the videography direction rose to the same level of energy as the music did.  Laufey's music is as always, faultless.
NONONOOOOO THIS IS SO SAD AND SO AMAZING ALL AT ONCE WELL DONE THE DIRECTING AND  VISUALS ARE SO MESMERIZING AGHHH
very cinematic and pretty beautiful ❤
Laufey te amo, gracias por todo 🫂
art. amazing, best cineamatography
Awwee my laufey heart 😢😢😢
oh my goddess <3
❤❤❤
Thank you for such a beautiful song ❤
God every laufey release is a masterpiece

I’ve been following Laufey for a few years now because their voice is beautiful and their songs have an awesome vibe to them. But this song is by far my favorite I’ve ever heard. It is gut wrenching and heartbreaking and just everything a good song should be. Incredible work, so excited to see what else is coming in the future ❤
All I can think of is, "Someone get that girl a father!"
the way that is sooo beautifully portrayed but the message is so sad like this MV got me crying and screaming

YEAAAAA
laufey princess of the universe
AGHHH💚💚
It always goes like this Could've predicted it I'm so naive to think you loved me for me Kissed as I ran off stage Too old to play this game Guess you're still growing up at thirty Oh  Were you surprised by me When you took me home? When the glamor wore off Reduced to skin and bone I can't even tell Who you want to know I'm a goddess on stage Human when we're alone  You took a star to bed Woke up with me instead You must have felt so damn deceived When you made up a version of Me that you thought you'd love But I am not your Aphrodite Oh  Were you surprised by me When you took me home? When the glamor wore off Reduced to skin and bone I can't even tell Who you want to know I'm a goddess on stage Human when we're alone  You took me for a fool You stole my youth You wanted this so much You watched me rise Then killed my light And now you know I'm not your fucking goddess Oh, oh I'm no goddess when I'm alone
i love you
MI CANCIÓN MÁS PERSONAL CTM
Just absolutely gorgeous.
LAUFEY MY GODESS, I LOVE YOU
Listening to you sing is like hearing a goddess singing it’s just so beautiful thank you ❤❤
THIS IS SO BEAUITFUL
im waiting on the comeback alblum, when she finds Troo Love in the most unexpected and abstract location, Pure Love never dies, and is unperishable in all ages -Fax
I already missed EIKOL live, AND Bewtiched live because I couldn't afford either concerts, but I WILL NOT I MISS HEARING THIS SONG LIVE!
This is amazing
I ACTUALLY CANNOT STOP SCREAMING HOW ARE THEY JUST GONNA TOUR TOGETHER AFTER THIS LIKE THIS MV DIDNT HAPPEN OMG
Soy tu fan 😭😭😭
She just looks like a Greek goddess
She ate again with this masterpiece I fear 🤍
everyones talking about the "I'm a goddess on stage, human when we're alone." but what about the lyric that goes "You made up a version of me that you thought  you loved but I am not your Aphrodite." THAT HIT HARD.
live laugh laufey
OMFG that is so amazing. Laufey you're so freaking beautiful, loved the video. Love the photography too❤❤❤

sobbing.
IM SCREAMING 😭😭😭😭😭
irl Circe✨
8JC8YIG UF. 77CTC77RX7XT. I??? I AM SO UNBELIEVABLY HAPPY?!?!?!?!?
the way in the start , she says “i’m a goddess on stage , human when WE’RE alone” and at the end “i’m a goddess on stage , human when IM alone” is so beautifully written and heart touching!!!!🙁🙁 I love how it portrays when he was with her and when he wasn’t 💘
This hit too close to home, started crying remembering a similar situation 💔
LAUFES LITTERALY A GODDESS HERSELF
So glad I pre-ordered the goddess edition of bewitched before they sold out😌
Crying, sobbing, and mourning my days without worries, love this laufey, thank you ❤
Its the way this looks so retro that adds to the cinematography like it was produced during the late 1990's. I absolutely love it
NDBEHE
MAGNOLIA REFERENCE?!?!
YOUVE COME SUCH A LONG WAY, I REMEMBER DISCOVERING YOU FROM YOUR FIRST EP <3
YES LAUFEY YES LAUFEY YES LAUFEY (im so sorry for what happened to you) YES LAUFEY YES LAUFEY

THIS IS JUST AH SPEECHLESS HEARTBREAKING, BREATHTAKING EMOTIONALLY MOVING😭🌸✨🥺
my god laufey. this is stunning
What is going on with romanticising smoking, though? :I Not a good look, especially with the very young fanbase.
Omg😭
THIS MADE ME SCREAM AND CRY I LOVE U
Stunning video Laufey! ❤❤
After watching this video and listing to the lyrics in depth I feel like the song has a whole new meaning in my head, I love this song and video!
live laugh love laufey
My other heartbeat song, not his aphrodite neither his goddess, but laufey is our goddess aphrodite❤
junia at the end???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
WILL GAO AND LAUFEY OMG WHO AM I SUPPOSED TO LOOK AT
So powerful 😢 love you
absolute CHILLS.
Gorgeous song.  Wonderful video.
😭😭😭😭
this song just reminds me a lot of the madonna whore complex and the virgin suicides but in a very ethereal and light way. it hurtsbut at this point it feels so dull. to be disappointed over something like this feels boring and useless that I just can't help but sigh when it happens. is it disappointment? or relief? nobody know? maybe both. glad to know nothing's changed laufey just has a way of breaking us down and pulling us deeper into this deep slumber that even the floor breaks under her voice's command/ message.
Will Gao and Laufey. 2 people who I wanted to collaborate so much. Hopefully Wasia project and Laufey release a song together soon sometime.
omg the tear at the end
This is so beautiful, yet sad and powerful ❤️
Profound. I suppose love will run you crazy just like music will - if you let them. 🍻 Laufey Congratulations on yet another fine release! EWM
OH MY GOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDD THIS IS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA😭😭😭😭😭😭❤❤❤❤❤
Best gift ever😭😭 cus today is my birthday
i love you sm laufey i’ve been listening to you since your first ep🫶🏾
THIS IS SO GOOD
Holy fucking shit
sobbing so hard rn.
The voice of laufey literally came from heaven. It sounds unreal! Good work laufey!
CELINE SONG THE DIRECTOR YOU ARE
IM IN TEARS. THAT WAS SO GOOD
You are a "total artwork"!!!😂
laufey you made me cry even this time 🥹😭
This is beautiful ❤
Haven’t seen a music video this powerful since Sarah Slean’s Get Home. Great work, Laufey. Superb.
EU VOU ME MATAR  ????????
That's not laufey that gives me something😭😭😭😭😭
this is so gorgeous, i love your songs so much
Words cant explain how much i love this song and with a cinematic video i just cant
MY GOD PUT THIS IN A MUSEUM
Yawn. Another “ waah, I’m a victim, men are evil” song. Well you picked him, sis. How about a female accountability song? Break some ground, take some responsibility.
❤❤❤❤❤
Goosebumps, everywhere 🥲
Laufey 😭
MY JAW HURTS FROM REACTING TO THIS
Stage costume feels like channeling Bjork a bit ❤
I ACTUALLY CANT BELIEVE WILL GAO AND LAUFEY ARE IN THE SAME VIDEO I CANT EVEN PUT INTO WORDS HOW HAPPY I AM
OBSESSED
This may be from the perspective of a celebrity, but this applies for everyone. Don’t give yourself to people who don’t want all of you, but just want your status.  I won’t go on a rant about hookup culture, but even if you’re okay with hookups, protect your heart. Make sure you can trust the person you’re sleeping with and your goals for the relationship align. If you want something more than they do, you’ll get hurt and they will be fine, and vise versa.  You are worth more than you realize
i think i just had a heart attack
w
Oh!! Okay!! Just rip my heart out and stomp on it!! No big deal!!
GRACIAS LAUFEY POR ESTE REGALO DE CUMPLEAÑOS 💗💗

I’ve been obsessed with this song, Laufey must be a witch (is she?😮) or something because she’s got me hypnotized with every song of hers 🥺💗💗 the music video was so great, gave me goosebumps!
the whole scene when they’re together outside and the fence makes it look like she is in prison, and not in love… the GENIUS in this video is woah.
OBSESSED

WAIT, THAT'S JUNIA AS THE GODDESS😫😫😫
Her hair is gorgeous!!! ✨🤍
i wish i could just marry her
1:38 I love how in this shot he almost fades in the background. She's there, sitting with him, almost resigned, she knows she won't get anything from him, she's just alone. 😢✨ This is a wonderful video and goes so well with the song
I'm speechless. 💜 It's like straight out of Rita's mouth... So powerful in all it's musical subtleness
holy smokes.

Is it me or when she sang the “kissed as I ran off stage”, they panned to the outfits that Laufey has previously worn at her shows? I recognize the silver dress but not the red one
this is creatively genius, im getting a dark midsommar vibe
Great work from Laufey, Will and Celine!

The way that even as he is undressed and laid bare in front of her, she is still dressed in the way that he wants to perceive her. In gold, still shining and being held on a pedestal as he worships everything that she is "supposed to be". This video made me sob it's so beautiful.
A wonderfull song. And the smile at the enddd😵‍💫😵‍💫
I cried.
Celine did an amazing job with the music video. Looks stunning and sounds even better.
Oh my god
threw myaelf at the walll
¿Pero que maravilla es esta? En la época de autotunes, sintetizadores e inteligencias artificiales encontrar tanto talento y preparación da esperanza de que no está todo perdido. Laufey, come to Spain.

This is beyond amazing omg. You are literally my most favourite artist. I hope to be like you one day
Does she really think she’s this desirable?! Yikes.
My jaw is on the floor
🤍💐
Laufey is the goddess of poetry this song captures so many emotions I can'e even begin to explain
The way her facial expressions just showed utter loneliness throughout took me out and brought tears to my eyes. And when that last verse hit the flood gates broke.

you are so amazing i love you. thank you for becoming who you are
Song of the year, I haven't heard or seen anything better than this. This may as well be song of the ever. Idk man. This song is the most beautifully crafted thing in human history. Deserves at least 200 Grammys just for the first second of the video. I think my sickness was cured after the 12th second so obviously deserves at least 1000 Nobel Prize awards just for that. Beautiful.
LOVE THE VIDEO LOVE THE CONCEPT SM but girl Will Gao is such a cutie patootie it's a bit hard to visualise him as a thirty year old bad guy 😭😭😭😭
🖤🖤
Laufey can u pls make a song in Chinese🥺
