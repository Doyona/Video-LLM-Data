This horn is really long
Yeah habs
Go Habs go Road tô.the 25th Stanley Cup ❤❤❤
Hutson is incredible his ceiling is so high.
Go Habs go Road tô 25th Stanley ❤
In the old days the Canucks were the worst team. The Sharks wasn't good neither. There was no Panthers yet,then they've arrived with the Ducks. Both were new teams,they wasn't good. Then few years after the Lightning and the Senators arrived. They wasn't good neither.
Canucks need to play in a league where there are only two periods.
Teams like the Canucks,the Golden Knights,the Panthers,the Oilers and the Lightning,they are not that good those years.
Miller a "Keeper"
that the story of canadien club when the things go good they trace good plaayer for à bad player i now shure the montreal canadien is the rocket of NHL
I was here a great game travels 10 hours in one day to watch amazing game from my boys go habs go
i was at the game last night the energy was incredible probably the best turn around game in a while!
I think St. Louise should consider promoting Heineman to first line , Slaf can develop better with less pressure
How can you goofs not show the Guhle hit that sparked the croud.
Next Bruins on the radar.
Habs are the repeat of Oilers last season  If they beat Washington , they qualify as cup contender in my book
Can you imagine Dobes beating another Standley cup cham  Washington ??
Im so happy they actually win now.
montembeault is so bad hes not a number 1 never been and never will thats why no team wanted him when canadiens got him 😂
JT Miller was everywhere.
I hate that Amazon gets their hands on another piece of our lives, but this broadcast is really good
We're comin baby!
Dustin Wolf of the Flames would be an excellent addition to the Habs.     Make it happen. 😊
If the Habs make the playoffs it will be the first time since ‘17 that they’ll be playing a home playoff game in front of a full capacity crowd. Will be absolutely ELECTRIC if it happens
Whoever makes these video does not know what highlight means!
Habs will take care of the Make Beliefs in the first round. Go Habs Go!
MTL will miss the playoff by one point 😂
Lane Hutson another goal😊😊😊😊😊😊
Slavkosky is a career minus ➖ 43. MORONS.
He’s on fire 13#
Yeah!! Go Habs go!  ❤❤❤
montreal beat the panthers......this team can spoil great teams except the best team in the NHL today...GO LEAFS GO!
The habs are awesome rn
I love how they cut to overtime with Montreal on a powerplay but don't show what the penalty was for -_-
They don’t give up easily. I like that
Habs furture is so bright i can hardly see
Canadiens are back !! GO HABS GO !!
Caufield.❤❤❤ Veselý lišiak ❤❤❤.🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉.....SlovákiaViliam.
Perfektné Canadiens❤❤❤.🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉..........😊
Habs are waking up! About time.
The curse and jinx of  The Hockey Guy  Canucks should still be a playoff team this season
❤❤❤ Juraj strieľaj!❤❤❤Skvelá séria Canadiens.❤❤❤Hokejista v NHL musí mať formu na špici po celú sezónu.Inak začne vyčnievať ako nespoľahlivý.Nesmie sa uspokojiť, keď získa bod a nechá svojich súperov streliť dva góly lebo ich nepokryl.❤❤❤Také chyby robila aj slovenská U20.❤❤❤
wild card spot somehow 😮
Un… un défilé de championnat tant attendu sur Ste-Cath ce printemps???  Non non, pas de chimèrage… Visons minimum une 8è place et plus haut pour un spot de playoff! 🤙🏻
Monty not good enough
If Newhook and Anderson start getting their mojo, the Habs will be hard to best.
without at least a three goal lead going into the third the canucks cant win this is past being pathetic .
JT Miller must of heard the chatter from the Canucks radio guys they were killing him yesterday and Petterson being out it makes you wonder
Attention: Kent Hughes and Jeff Gorten. Under no circumstances make a trade for Elias Petterson. I live in Vancouver. Patterson is a soft, unmotivated, whiny, always injured, and basically useless hockey player. He stopped playing the day he signed his big contract. The players mentioned in a possible trade( Beck, Roy, Guhle, etc) are all individually much better than Petterson. I wouldn't  take him for a 6th-round pick. Not even Primeau for Petterson would be fair. Please don't do it, Kent.
I watched the game and it looked like after the last goal there was something being reviewed. I saw the goalie reaction here but still no idea what they were contesting. Anyone know?
Canucks have always been a lame duck team. Lovers for sure.
Happy Habs!!😊
All this talk of trading Miller. Guy is a stud, hope Canucks don’t make that mistake.
Just like the old Forum, this arena is a blast. Keep it going, Habs. Playoffs in sight. 👍
les gagnants de la coupe stanley souvent explose qu'a paritr de la deuxieme moitie de la saison.....
With Fowler in the pipeline , the best trade for Hughes be Montambault ...let 's add Savard , Dvorak and perhaps Armia to that list too..But Evans is a perfect center, well liked in the locker room  and a fan's fav . Why trade him?
Montambault 1-1 and 8 goals against in past two starts  Dobes 2-0 with 1 goals against and he played against two much  stronger teams   You can be sure Montambault is no longer no. 1 Goalie rotation is the way to go , with the hot hands getting the nod most often
Im exhausted, this game was a playoff style !!! the way they skate and charge to the puck, the forecheck ... They are just awesome to watch ! Litterally everyone played like it was a no tomorrow game 🤟
JFC calm down with the "Dobes instead of Montembeault!!!" comments...
Is Caufield the smallest player in NHL? what he lack in size is made up in skill, very good skillful player.
The Bell center is so loud!!!!
Hmmmmm... C'est rare mais je vais blâmer Sam sur 3 des 4 buts des Canucks. C'était flagrant, il ne se relève pas assez vite pour avoir de la mobilité. Sam... Sam !!! Je commençais à voir bleu lorsqu'encore une fois, très très peu de tirs au but en 1ère... Mais encore une fois, on a gagné, pheeew ! Go Habs Go
Anyone know why VAN goalie Lifts his Stick after the ot winner?
Lane Hutson is unreal 🔥
Hutson 3 points... what a night !!! cant wait about demidov and him !!
nice to see Hughes back in the Norris hunt in fine form...
Go Habs Go!
Canucks fading.......
Montréal avec 5 victories c’est parti !🎉🎉🎉
Jacob Dobes wouldn’t have let in 4 goals to begin with. It would have been 4-1 Habs! Go Jacob
I knew Canucks was gonna lose when I saw there was overtime 😂😂😂
MTL.... in playoff.... That's crazy
Move Myers now. He is the most useless Canuck and possibly one of the worst players to ever play in the NHL.
We are never going to win in OT right?
Hutson is amazing to watch as a non Habs fan
The Habs will be a wagon of a team very soon. Just wait till Demidov comes.
Hutson for the calder for sure 🔥
Montreal is not only a team on a mission but they're playing like a team on a mission.
We want DOBES !!
I like Montambault , but he doesn't look like a number 1 with Dobes on the bench ...  With Dobes this game world be 5-2 MTL
What a game!  Glad I tuned in as this was playoff hockey played by teams trying to make it. Habs are for real.
Montreal has temporarily moved  into a wild card spot.
Highlights went from 1-1 9 min left to 1-0 with 11 min left
Another play off like game from the Habs ..really fun to watch
Where's Dobes???😮😮😮let him play😂😂😂❤❤❤
Canucks are going to miss the playoffs . The team has no heart. Time to shake the team.
The Canucks just casnnot hold a lead anymore
Dobes should be #1
Despite the score, it was a very tight checking game, almost like playoffs
WHAT A NIGHT FOR HUTSON!  3 points wow!
Samuel needs to go this guy sucks
With his goal and two assists tonight, Hutson now has more points than Michkov and Celebrini. LFG!!!!!!
Hutson leads all rookie in points as a dman !!
shame for not showing the Guhle hit
We want Dobes as our starter goalie
Amazon Commentator sucks!
The Canucks blew a 3-1 lead what a laughable team lol 😂
is it just me or is the quality buggin
Hutson and Ghule was on fire tonight 🔥
Nothing to see here Vancouver fans... Just the Canucks coughing up another 3rd period lead and losing again...😂😂
F these referees tonight
Habs are starting to be pretty fun to watch.
360p... What is this, 2005?
To all morons saying we should lose this season for a draft pick, hutson was drafted 62nd and is the NUMBER ONE ROOKIE OF THE YEAR, the Habs are officially in the playoffs, that's all we want, all we need, draft order dont mean S.  Go Habs Go!!!
the cup....
Wow. Habs Stanley cup winner 2025
Go habs go
